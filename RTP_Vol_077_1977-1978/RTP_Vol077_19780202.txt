are down more than 40 percent
from last year, according to
Ken Ruscio, assistant director
of admissions.

As of last Friday, the school
had received 516 applications,
compared to. 918 by the same
date last year. W&L has receiv-
ed an average of 1,320 applica-
tions each year, said Ruscio,
ee will be hard ‘pressed to

 

Applications for admission to

reach that figure this year with
the Feb. 15 application deadline
only 212 weeks away.

Ruscio attributes this
substantial drop to several fac-
tors, most notably the addition
of an essay to the application
form. The applicant is asked to
“develop an essay of 400 to 600
words discussing what in-
dividual, living or dead, you
would most enjoy talking to for
an evening and state precisely
why.”

Dave McLean, one of two
students who help with admis-
sions, said he believes the ques-
tion has been more a delaying
factor and by. the time all ap-
plications are counted there will
have only been a 20 percent
drop. He says that the question
will have to be dropped,
however, because students who
use W&L as a back-up for Ivy
League schools may not take
the time to answer a long essay
question. W&L has a history of

being able to attract “Ivy
League rejects,’’ he added.

The question was included
“primarily to gain a better
understanding of their (the stu-
dent’s) writing ability, but also
to get some insight into the in-
dividual himself — what he’s
like, what his interests are, that
sort of thing,’ he said.

The essays also will be given
to the faculty advisors of those
students who decide to attend

W&L, Ruscio said. After

reading the essays, the advisor
will be better able to tell the stu-
dent whether he should take a
course in basic English gram-
mar.
There have been a wide range
of responses to the essay, in-
‘cluding several Ben Franklins,
Thomas Jeffersons, Jesus
Christs and even a Donald
Duck.

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, FEBRUARY 2, 1978

E.C. to question McNider’s tactics

Jim McNider, chairman of
the Student Control Committee,
may be asked to appear at Mon-
day’s Executive Committee
meeting to explain certain pro-
cedural irregularities of his
committee, EC President Jim
Underhill said Tuesday.

Underhill said McNider is in
the habit of pursuing Student
Control matters himself rather
than consulting the whole com-
mittee. Underhill said McNider
is on his own personal crusade

and confirmed reports. that

McNider has been turning
many Student Control matters
over to the EC for honor trials.
Underhill originally said Stu-
dent Control had taped a hear-
ing, but after learning of
MeNider’s denial of doing so
Underhill admitted he had no
first hand knowledge. He said
that McNider had requested
and received a tape recorder
which MeNider wanted to use to
tape a committee hearing
which he thought might later
reveal discrepancies in

testimony serious enough to be
brought before the EC.

MeNider admitted asking
some students if they would
mind having their proceding
recorded, but said no student
agreed to such an arrangement.

MecNider also admitted that
he had asked students caught
for smoking marijuana in the
dormitories to sign a statement
admitting to certain facts in the
case. McNider said the students
signed the statements ‘‘of their
own free will.”’

Minorities given special preference

by Ben Keesee

Minorities, sons of alumni,
and local students are given
what Lewis G. John, Dean of
Students, termed as “special
preference’? when being con-
sidered for admission to
Washington and Lee. In addi-
tion, minorities are given
preferential treatment in the
area of financial aid.

In a recent interview, Dean
John stated that after ap-
plicants deemed academically
qualified are determined,
students identified as ‘‘special
preference’’ category members
are “offered admission without
competition with others (ap-
plicants).”’

When questioned about the
“special preference”’ policy and
its effects, Associate Dean of
Students and Coordinator of the
freshman year, H. Robert
Huntley, replied ‘‘We do iden-
tify them and that’s about all.”’
Huntley did, however, say that
once a ‘‘special preference”
category student is identified,
“We make every effort to ac-
cept him.”

Also, when the admissions
committee considers the ap-
plication of a minority student
Scholastic Aptitude Test score
are played down, while class.
rank and grade point average
are emphasized, Huntley said.
Board scores of minority ap-
plicants are consistently lower
than those of non-minority ap-
plicants, but this difference is
what. he termed a “cultural

phenomena.’’ Huntley said SAT
scores are not considered
reliable indicators of academic
ability and ‘do not reflect
native intelligence.”

Dean John further stated that
Washington and Lee does
‘“‘make some special efforts’’ to

secure attendance of minority
students. When asked for an ex-
ample of those “special ef-
forts,’ Dean John stated that
“blacks do get a more favorable
portion of grant.’’ (Grant refers

Washington and Lee students
are in favor of coeducation ac-
cording to a poll taken by the
Ring-tum Phi Monday. Thirty-
six percent of the student body
participated in the poll in which
56 percent of those voting
favored coeducation.

In the same poll, 55 percent of
the students were unsatisfied
with the social life. Of those who
voted for coeducation, 81 per-
cent were unsatisfied with the
social life while 80 percent of
those who voted against
coeducation were satisfied with
the social life.

Fifty-one percent of the
fraternity members were in
favor of coeducation, while 62
percent of the independents
favored it. At the same time, 67
percent of the independents
were unsatisfied with the social
life yet only 56 percent of frater-
nity men think the social life is
satisfactory.

tion. They did so 62-51. The
juniors, sophomore and
freshman classes voted for
coeducation 63-34, 73-59, and
96-48 respectively.

A computation of chi square
showed the results of the survey
to be significant. The chi square
of 5.9 indicates there is only a
two percent chance that the
results are insignificant and do
not reflect the opinion of the en-
tire student body.

In February, 1976 the Board
of Trustees voted unanimously
to remain an all-male institu-
tion. The trustees indicated that
considerations of size, cur-
riculum and_ traditional
character were primary factors
influencing their decision. A
study undertaken indicated
coeducation would require an
increase in the university’s size.
The trustees felt an increase in
the student body should be
avoided. Coeducation, they felt,
would mean a possible change
in the curriculum which would

here. Coeducation would prac-
tically destroy the traditional
nature of Washington and Lee.
Washington and Lee is the na-
tion’s oldest all-male institu-
tion.

In 1975, the faculty voted
53-49-5 recommending that the
trustees adopt coeducation. In
their statement to the trustees
they said, “The faculty, having
considered the impact of
coeducation without regard to
economic considerations,
believe, coeducation would
have a favorable effect upon the
academic program at
Washington and Lee “

Dissenting faculty members
at the time had some _in-
teresting things to say about

betrayal of serious education.”
Coeducation is ‘typical rather
of Soviet Russian and Red
Chinese society.”’ In ‘‘Western

countries...nothing much is ‘at

sional aquiescence.”’

Colby, who served as CIA
director from 1973 to 1976, told
told of how recent intelligence
in the past years have shocked
Americans more than surprised
them.

Fictional characters like
James Bond have provided
Americans with the image
about intelligence gathering, he
said, but added that the CIA is
now becoming better
understood.

“If the CIA did something
wrong, let’s correct and control
it,” he shouted over the podium,
‘“‘not do away with it because of
some disasterous incidents that
I personally believe were few
and far between “‘

In that light, Colby, a
Princeton and Columbia law
graduate, said that former CIA
Director Richard Helms should
not have been prosecuted or in-
dicted for his false and inac-
curate testimony to a Senate

committee.

As for Frank Snep’s new
book, Decent Interval, which
describes the bungling of the
Saigon evacuation of American
and Vietnamese civilians dur-
ing the final days of the Viet-
nam war, Colby said Snep was

overly critical and that all of the

and a

gentleman,

a factory

 

by Galen Trussell

Mark Bradley, a_ very
atypical senior at Washington
and Lee, has been awarded a
Fulbright scholarship to study
inGermany. .

The Fulbright scholarship is
the most recent of Bradley’s
laurels, but not his most im-
pressive. Bradley is also the

first Rhodes’~ scholar
Washington and Lee has pro-
duced since 1973.

Bradley said he didn’t feel he
was your typical man about
campus, whose social life
centers around fraternities and
grain parties. He admitted he
was “kind of a loner.” Mark
credited his attraction to W&L
not to the social life here but to

the teachers he has had in his
four years here.

“It was the professors here at
W&L that helped me _ get
motivated to do really well,”
Bradley confessed.

Professors Machado and
Dickens were the two out of a
list of about ten teachers
Bradley credited as helping him
the most. Bradley also said that
his being the first member of
his family to go to college added
to his desires to do well.

“The reason I’ve done so well
at Washington and Lee is
because it was such a big deal
for me to go to college,”
Bradley said.

Even with his job at Roanoke
Iron and Bridge Works, where

he puts in about 30 hours a
week, Mark has maintained a
3.8 GPA. He laughingly denied
he was a “‘work-aholic”’.

Being chosen for a Rhodes
scholarship was an incredible
honor Bradley admitted. He
said he felt like he was in a state
of shock when it happened.

“When I learned I had been
selected for the Rhodes, my
first thought was how pleased
all my professors at
Washington and Lee would be,”’
Bradley said.

Bradley began his successful
bid for the Rhodes honor last
year by submitting a 1,000 word
essay about his goals in life. The
Rhodes screening board then

in after causing $1400

damage

A fifth of Wild Turkey
whiskey mixed with an assort-
ment of other mind-expanding
concoctions was what sparked
the much-publicized  sign-
tearing incident last Saturday
night, according to one fo the
students involved.

Police Chief J. A. Kirby said
26 street signs in downtown Lex-
ington had been torn down and
that damage was estimated at
$1,400.

The students, both
Washington and Lee freshmen,
said they only were responsible
for 10 signs.

“I’m not heavy enough to do
all that damage,” one freshman
said.

Both students said they turn-
ed themselves in to the police
and were charged with a viola-
tion of Section 21:25 of the City
Code that states it is unlawful to
damage public property.

The two freshmen said they
were sorry for the vandalism
and that they were willing to ac-
cept the consequences.

“Whether it was right or
wrong, it still was illegal,’’ one
of the freshmen said.

The case was brought before
the Executive Committee, but

was forwarded to Student Con-
trol. The hearing will be held on
Thursday, according to the two
students.

Michael T. Cleary, ” senior
member of the Student Control
Committee, refused to discuss
what, if any, punishments will
be assessed.

Both freshmen will testify in
Lexington General District
Court on Feburary 28.

RtP Series on Fraternities

Frat houses deteriorating

3rd _ in a series

by Randy Smith

Complaints from alumni have
pressured the Fraternity In-
spection Committee to recom-
mend that a chedklist be sent to
each of Washington and Lee’s
fraternities, on a monthly basis,
to insure that interior and ex-
terior maintenance work be:
performed on fraternity houses.
Failure to comply with the
maintenance requests on the
checklists will result in punitive
action.

Concern for the structural
condition of many of W&L’s
fraternities has also been
registered by the school’s ad-
ministration, town residents,
and a fire and safety survey
conducted by an independent in-
vestigation firm.

The fire and life safety report,
conducted by the National Loss
Control Service Corporation
last fall, said in part: ‘‘The
respect for fellow students’ life
and safety is very lax...”

In a strongly worded conclu-
sion, the survey went on to say
that ‘‘the present conditons of
the fifteen fraternity houses
visited are sucb, that in no way
can a reasonable level of life
safety be assured for the
students.”

Dr. Thomas C. Imeson, chair-
man of ‘the recently formed
Fraternity Inspection Commit-
tee, said that the past ‘‘grievous
neglect”’ of fraternity members
for their chapter houses has

 

resulted in structrual damage
and deterioration. ‘‘We’re not
interested in dictating to frater-
nities how they protect the
health and welfare of their
members,” Dr. Imeson explain-
ed, “but we must assure
minimum safety standards.’
“The Alumni Board express-
ed a real interest’’ in the ap-
parent structural deterioration
of many of W&L’s fraternities,
said Dan Murphy, Assistant
Dean of Students and Coor-
dinator of Fraternity Affairs.
“They felt that something
should be done (about the struc-

tural condition of many frater-
nity houses) because the frater-
nities are a reflection on
Washington and Lee.”’

Dean Murphy characterized
past fraternity maintenance ef-
forts as ‘‘somewhat negligent in
the appearance and upkeep of
their houses.”’

Four different options were
reportedly considered by the
Fraternity Inspection Commit-
tee to remedy chapter house
conditions: (1) do nothing and
let the present structures col-
lapse from misues; (2) turn

It was ‘“‘no declaration of in-
dependence,”’
said, but the open hearing on
the honor system in Lewis Hall
Tuesday was an opportunity for
law students to express their
dissatisfaction with honor trial
proceedings.

The main complaints focused
on the EC’s procedure of con-
ducting inquisitorial hearings
as opposed to adversary hear-
ings, the absolute honor viola-
tion sanctions and the appeal
procedure.

Some specific White Book
changes were also suggested.
One student said that a white
book section which states that
the EC recognizes no physical
or geographic power. The stu-
dent said that if he chose to lie,
cheat or steal in Illinois he
should not be subject to EC
discretion. He suggested that
the White Book make it clear
that the EC only have jurisdic-
tion on the W&L campus.

The same student excoriated
the appeal procedure. He said
‘the fact that a student does not
have an honor trial go on his
written record if only the EC
hears it, but does have a trial go
on record if he appeals for a
public Student Body Hearing is
a deterrent for appeal. He said.
it would be equivalent to the
Supreme Court requiring a
$1,000 fee to hear an appeal. He
suggested that all trials be off
the record.

as Derek Swope .

The law student went on to
say that the White Book does
not include any safeguard
against double jeapordy. If new
evidence came up a year or so
later, a persons could be
retired, yet key witnesses may
have graduated. He suggested a
White Book change which would
require that a student could not
be tried twice for the same of-
fense.

Another student said that he
thinks the EC has too much

E.C. gives its OK
to M.C. beer blast

by Randy Smith

Tentative plans for a nickle-
beer night, to be sponsored by
the Mock Convention Commit-
tee sometime in March, were
approved by by the Executive
Committee Monday night.

Mock Convention’s request
was merely for permission to
have the beer function, not to
solicit funds from the EC. The
nickle-beer party is budgeted
for $75.

Representatives from the
Mock Convention Committee
said that the purposes of the
beer night are to ‘generate in-
terest’’ for the 1980 Convention
and ‘‘get as many people involv-
ed as possible’’ in the initial
planning of the mock political
convention — still two years
away.

In the only other action dur-
ing the EC’s brief Monday night
meeting, Jackie Boyden and
new law school representative
Tom Healy clarified the law
school’s stance with regard to
Washington and Lee’s honor
system.

Miss Boyden explained that
the law students are ‘‘not ad-
vocating separation” from the
undergraduates, but want
“procedural changes’ in the
manner in which honor cases
are conducted. The Student Bar
Association has formed a steer-
ing committee to review pro-
cedural reforms’ Miss Boyden

said.

The suggestions of the steer-
ing committee will be referred
to a ‘“‘student-wide’’ committee
for additional comments; both
sets of recommendations will
then be sent to the EC.

Healy added that the SBA’s
suggestions for improving the
honor trial procedures should
not be viewed as ‘‘an attempt to

take over the honor system, but.

an effort to improve it ‘‘

Jim Underhill and George
Griffin, president and vice
president of the EC, respective-
ly, will be involved in the SBA
reform suggestions, it was
noted.

power. He suggested that the
executive, judicial and
legislative powers which are all
invested in the EC be broken up
among three student organiza-
tions, one of which would be
soley responsible for honor
trials.

These, however, were the on-
ly substantive changes sug-
gested. Most of the meeting was
involved with clearing up
misconceptions which law
students have about the honor
system. Many law _ students
thought that honor defendents
were not presented with
evidence against them before
the honor trial, were not
presented with charges before
the trail and did not screen out
bad cases. Some even thought
the EC gave less than 24 hours
notice before a trial.

Actually, the EC is required
to give at least 24 hours notice,
and is in the habit of giving
more time if necessary. Also,

 

when defendants are told of the
honor trial, they are given an
explanation of the charges both
orally and in writing and are
given copies of all physical
evidence against them. Futher-
more, before this process can
procede, a screening process
does take place, in which three
EC members decided whether
there is enough cause to bring a
case to trial.

Because of the many
misconceptions evinced at the

‘meeting, one law student said
he has strong feelings that

much of the dissatisfaction
shown by law students toward
the honor system is a result of
ignorance of standard honor
trial procedures. Many students
agreed with him, saying they
had not been properly informed
of the honor system during
orientation.

Tom Healy, the new EC law
representative, suggested that
the EC present a program to

law freshmen during orienta-
tion that would help clear up
such misunderstandings. The
idea seemed to be universally
accepted and Swope, head of
the Board of Governors, said
the honor system presentation
will be incorporated into the
freshman orientation program

next year.
There were some highly
philosophical arguements

discussed at the meeting. For
instance, one student asked
“What is a peer?” She said
that the EC is not really a group
of her peers because she is
aobut five years older than
most of them. Given tbat an
honor violation is basically
whatever is deemed
dishonorable by the student
generation involved, she said
she wondered how the younger
undergraduates could judge her
actions.

Other law students disagreed
with her point of view, saying
they thought undergraduates
and graduates probably have
the same view of honor. It was
more a disagreement between
them as to what methods they
should use to conduct honor
trials, many law students said.
Law students seemed to agree
that they prefer an adversary
trial in which the defendant can
be advised by a_ specially-
trained third year law student.
They also want more time to be
able to prepare a defense; a
matter of two or three days
rather than one day, said one
Lewis Hall man.

Law students also seemed
distressed by the lack of
codification of the White Book.
One particularly animated stu-
dent identified as John Frazier
said the EC is relying too much
on “‘folkways’’ rather than on
precedent. He said such
reliance left students with no
way to “pattern their conduct.”’

UT Plans return to the 1890’s
in Spring program

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

Dr. Albert Gordon, head of
the Department of Fine Arts,
has announced tentative plans
for the spring term, Drama 139
(total theatre) course to be of-
fered this coming April. A
meeting has been announced
for next Monday, February 6, at
3:30 in the Troubadour Theatre.

Dr. Gordon, who will be direc-
ting all the shows in this pro-
gram, is starting a tradition
that many hope will be repeated
in succeeding years in Lex-
ington — that is, summer
theatre for the many tourists
who visit Lexington during the
summer. All those who sign up
for Drama 139 will have the op-
tion of staying in Lexington for
roughly the first half of the sum-
mer, and continue to present
the plays.

The point must be stressed
that there is no obligation to
stay in Lexington over the sum-
mer, once one has signed up for
the course. The grade in Gor-
don’s course will be based upon
work in the six weeks; money,
in the form of a_ proposed
“profit-sharing” plan, will be
the incentive for the summer
part of the program.

The general theme of the spr-
ing presentation will be
remembering theatre of the
1890’s. The Drama Department
will attempt to bring back the
flavor of the period through
three plays. Opening the season
will be Little Mary Sunshine,
the well known musical parody
of all those ‘Student Prince’’-
type operettas of the age. This
play will be rehearsed with an
eye to opening before gradua-
tion, for the W&L community.
The two other productions will
open in June: Rip Van Winkle, a

famous 19th century rendition
of the Washington Irving story;
and Dirty Work at the
Crossroads, a_ typical
melodrama of the time. All the
productions will be presented in
the Troubadour Theatre, which
will be air-conditioned for the
summer.

Tom Ziegler’s impressive
talents of Beaux’ Strategem
fame will be called into action
once again for this project. The
attempt will be to turn the
Troubadour into a Lexington
variety theatre of that time.
Upon completion, it will be
christened ‘‘The Henry Street
Light Opera and Melodrama
Company.”

Dr. Gordon has sent out a
special call for musicians to fill
the proposed small orchestra,
women to fill the necessary

parts, and interested backstage
workers. It should be noted that
those who want to do technical
work in the course and no ac-
ting, will find more work
available than ever before.
Special areas which will need
large staffs during the term
itself will be public relations-
publicity, and all the regular
backstage crews. Even with
two of the shows technically
ready by the end of classes.

This is an exciting opportuni-
ty to help what very well may
become a yearly Lexington
tradition...But help is certainly
needed, from actors to poster-
hangers. Even if you are still
uncertain, go to the meeting
next Monday and find out more.
If you are unable to attend in-
formation may be obtained
from Dr. Gordon at 463-9111,
ext. 351.

Feb. 9. Curtain time is 8 p.m., and reservations should be made in

treats the themes of incest and child-murder — so controversial
when ‘Desire’ was first produced in 1924 that it was banned in
many cities. Even now, however, ‘the power of the play has not
diminished,’ according to Chris Willett, the director. Willett is
directing the play as his senior drama thesis.
Cable Nine: new
schedule announced

Two new shows, two already
established shows and specials
throughout the year highlight
the new Cable Nine schedule for
this term.

According to Tom Williams,
production co-manager of the
student television station, the
new sc edule is an attempt to
appeal to both Washington and
Lee students and townspeople.

Williams said the schedule
has not changed that much
from this past term, but an ef-
fort has been made to provide
stability.

“Last term we had some
shows, produced in our studios,
that would be ready one week
and then not the next. We have
shows this term that we can
count on every week,’’ said
Williams.

A UNIVERSAL RELEASE

a:

by Mark Mainwaring
Associate Music Director
WLUR-FM
This week in Mainstream,
you’ll find a counterpoint to last
week’s favorable Elvis Costello
review, plus information on a
concert that should leave ears

ringing for days.
My Aim Is True.
Elvis Costello Columbia JC
35037
Costello’s lyrics are only

average, the instrumental work
is fair, and the vocals are ir-
ritating. My Aim Is True is,
quite simply, one of the most
overrated records in recent
memory. Why is this man get-
ting so much media exposure?
Reason A: He has an odd
stage presence and is downright
funny-looking. Obviously, this
isn’t the only reason (after all,
WLUR Music Director Leslie
Gillen isn’t famous yet), so we
move along to Reason B:
Costello sounds a lot like the se-
cond most overrated artist in
recent memory, Bruce Springs-
teen. Reason C: His music is
“real,” it ‘“‘comes from the
streets.” Music from the streets
is big these days, even if it’s not
played very well. Reason D: All
the previous reasons (especial-
ly the resemblance to Springs-
teen) have combined to attract
the support of the powers that
be in rock-journalism, and par-

ticularly the New York-based
media. The resultant hype cam-
paign has convinced a lot of

otherwise intelligent people
that Elvis Costello is the future
of rock and roll. I don’t pretend
to know what the future of the
genre may be, but this ain’t it.
My Aim Is True is a waste of
good vinyl. Concert Note: Ted
Nugent will appear at the
Roanoke Civic Center this Fri-
day, February 3, at8 P.M. Since
his emergence at age sixteen
with the Detroit-based Amboy

 

Dukes, Nugent has been putting
out some of the best hard-
hitting rock around, and his.
concerts are high energy affairs
to say the least. Says Nugent of
his audience: “If they ain’t
foaming at the mouth after ten
minutes then we’ve screwed
up.”’ The show will have the ad-
ded attraction of two first-rate
opening acts, Sammy Hagar
and Golden Earring. For true
rock and rollers, this is a show
not to be missed.

 

In

We've got a really big show
for you music enthusiasts this
Friday in the Cockpit. The Se-
cond Hand Band will be pickin’
and scratchin’ for your musical
delight into the wee hours.

Plans have been made to con-
tact several bands out of the
Lynchburg area to play in the
Cockpit. I say plans because
nobody on the UCC has been

them.

Last weekend Washington
and Lee might have experienc-
ed a new and totally unknown
phenomena: two good bar
bands in a weekend. I realize
some of you may scoff at me
and say: There couldn’t have
been two good bar bands around
Washington and Lee in one
weekend, BUT I counter you by
saying neither the Cockpit, nor
SAB, were ever responsible for
them.

Yes, folks, believe it or not,
I’m giving the SAB a pat on the
back for acutally using student
funds to get a good rock band.
The Good Humor Band played

cellent southern boogie at the

date shook me back to reality
and I was good humored to hear
the band playing ‘‘Jessica”’ lick
for lick like the Brothers, God
rest their souls. It sounded like
they had come back from the
dead. This was the extent of my
memory of that party.

Dan Scott deserves credit for
getting an excellent band, The
Allstars, in the Cockpit last Fri-
day. How Dan ever got them
down there when the Cockpit’s
budget is so, so lean because of
such a big overhead I’ll never
know, but the band was tight.
The Allstars did mostly their
own creations, and the dollar
cover charge didn’t seem to
deter too many people. I ask
you benevolent reader, don’t
you think the EC should start
letting us charge a cover more
often for that kind of entertain-
ment?

Swimmers push
record to 6-1

For the 32nd time since 1929,
the Washington and Lee swim-
mers defeated William and
Mary, winning 70-43 last Satur-
day in the Cy Twombly pool.
The W&L win avenged a 1976-77
Indian victory, and gives W&L
a 6-1 record in 1977-78.

Now in his twelfth season as
head W&L swimming coach,
Bill Stearns labels this edition
of the Generals ‘‘the best since
he’s been here.’ Not only are
the mermen again very strong
in the freestyle events, but they
also have more depth this year
than ever before. That depth
was evident in the W&M meet
at W&L won nine of the 13
events.

Senior John Hudson was a tri-
ple winner capturing first in the
1000 free (10:39.78), then com-
ing right back in the next event
— the 200 free (1:49.17), and
also winning the 500 free
(4:54.52). Freshman diving
standout Jay Diesing won both
the one (151.19) and three meter
(214.60) diving events.

Single winners for W&L in-
cluded Keith Romich with a
new school record in the 200 fly
(2:02.29), Seott Duff in the 100
free (50.59), David Kent in the
200 individual medley (2:06.93),
and Bob Newcomb in the 50 free

(22.93). Stearns points to the
strength in the diving events —
freshman George Irvine was se-
cond in the one meter and third
in the three meter vs. W&M,
and depth throughout the lineup
as the factors separating this
years’ team from other very
successful W&L teams.

Transfer David Kent gives
W&L a consistent threat in the
individual medley and
backstroke along with Drew
Pillsbury, while senior Peter
Meem has done well in the
breastroke all season. Kent
broke the W&L 200 backstroke
record held by Pillsbury on
Saturday (2:04.49) but was edg-
ed out by W&L’s Jack Phillips
for first (2:04.11).

Stearns is quick to point out
that the finishes of the last two
W&L teams — 8th nationally
and six All-Americans in 1975-76
and 9th nationally and five All-
Americans in 1976-77, will be
difficult to surpass this March
2-4in Wheaton, III.

Kent is not eligible to compete
in the nationals due to transfer
status, and the lack of a strong
medley relay team will hurt the
Generals chances to move up.
But Stearns vows that the team
will give it their best to do just

Grapplers defeat
VMI Keydets

by Mark Paterson

For the second consecutive
year the wrestling Generals
won the city championship as
they smashed Lexington rival
VMI 27-9 on Wednesday even-
ing. The victory, which raised
the team’s record to 4-2, came
on the heels of last week's
equally impressive victory over
Eastern Mennonite and helped
restore any confidence the team
might have lost on their recent
trips through the Carolinas.

After losing the first two mat-
ches at 126 and 134 pounds (both
teams forfeited at 118), the
Generals came alive with their
dynamic middleweight power
and took control of the match.
First, Ray Gross, one of the top
wrestlers on the team at 142
pounds and Jim Flippen (150)
registered pins, turning a 6-0
deficit into a 12-6 lead. Then, the
Generals scored 6 more points
at 158 pounds when tri-captain
Ed Rodger’s opponent suffered
an accidental injury and had to
default the match. With the
score now standing at 18-6
freshman Dave Stoeffel iced the

match with a convincing 12-1

victory at 167 pounds. Following
Stoeffel’s strong showing Tom
Oxendine (177) and tri-captain
Dan Kniffen (190) ran the
Generals victory streak to six
before the Keydets scored their
final victory in the heavyweight
match.

Following the victory over
VMI, Coach Gary Franke took
several of his wrestlers to the
highly competitive Virginia
state meet at Old Dominion
University. Competing against
such powerful Division I schools
as William and Mary, Virginia,
and Virginia Tech the Generals
gave a most creditable showing
with Ray Gross winning his 11th
match of the year and Ed
Rodgers his 12th and 13th.

With the team’s confidence
and enthusiasm at their peaks,
the Generals now prepare for a
difficult part of their schedule.
Following the Jan. 31 meet
against powerful Liberty Bap-
tist the team competes in the
Pembrook Invitational on
Saturday, Feb. 4. The Generals
return home on Tuesday, Feb. 7
to battle conference rival
Hampden-Sydney.

WE&L nips Lynchburg
in final minutes

by Ken Mastrilli

W&L co-captain Bob Forlen-
za hit four foul shots and made a
crucial steal in the last minute
and a half of play and Pat Den-
nis, W&L’s other co-captain,
scored 21 points to lead the
W&L basketball Generals in a
78-74 victory over Lynchburg
College here Monday night. It
may have been W&L’s best

game of the year.
Forlenza, who sparked the
Generals with eight points in a

One-point victory over
Hampden-Sydney earlier this
season, stole an errant Lyn-
chburg pass during a Hornet
stall and streaked down court.
He almost hit an amazing layup
despite being clobbered by two
Lynchburg defenders.

It looked like a two-shot foul,
but Forlenza was only given a
1-1 situation. It didn’t really
matter, however, because
Forlenza calmly hit both shots
despite the electrifying tension

 

caused by the screaming of
1,000 Lynchburg and W&L fans.

‘With nine seconds left in the
game, Forlenza again made the
big play. He came up with a
loose ball after a flurry of shots
by Lynchburg, any of which
could have tied the game at 76-
all. Forlenza was immediately
fouled again, and he iced the
game for the Generals with two
more shots from the charity
stripe.

Forlenza, who says he shoots
“thousands of foul shots in prac-
tice’ said he wasn’t really sur-
prised that he made them. ‘“‘It’s
all a matter of getting your
rhythm,”’ he chuckled, ‘‘then its
no problem.”

One problem the Generals did
have was making their first
basket of the game. They went
the first three minutes without
making a shot’ missing tbeir
first seven attempts. It looked
like they might get blown out of
their own gym as Lynchburg
jumped to a 8-0 lead.

“But we didn’t get impa-
tient,’’ said head coach Verne
Canfield, ‘‘We know Lynchburg
is an emotional, up and down
team and I’m really satisfied
with the way we came back.”’

Canfied was especially pleas-
ed with the play of his ‘‘super-
subs’”’ Bob Smitherman and
Bruce Williams, who always
manage to get the Generals go-
ing when they come in the
game. Williams scored eight
points, all layups off of great
passes from Mike Wenke and
Bob Forlenza, the two point
guards who played superbly.
Smitherman came in, perform-
ed well and drew four Lyn-
chburg fouls in the space of
about two minutes, which
enabled the Generals to get into
the one-and-one situation.

Leunig, who up to this point
seemed to have been the forgot-
ten man, played probably his
best game of the year. He
scored 16 points while pulling

Piranian attends coaches
convention in Boston

by Phillip Timp

Rolf Piranian, the amiable
second-year head soccer coach
at W&L, recently spent an en-
joyable and informative three
days in Boston attending the
38th annual National Soccer
Coaches Association Conven-
tion.

Piranian, one of about 500
coaches from around the coun-
try making the trip on Jan. 18,
attended the convention for the
first time and was impressed
both by what he saw and by
what he learned.

Meeting a number of very
successful college coaches
whom he has admired for years
is what Piranian considers the
highlight of the weekend con-
vention.

Piranian said he was able to
meet such reknowned soccer
coaches as Jerry Yeagley, who
guided Indiana University to se-
cond place in the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association soc-
cer finals, and Lincoln Phillips,

Howard University’s winning
coach.

Piranian said that he also at-
tended several coaching clinics
and was fortunate to hear three
lecutes given by Charles
Hughes, the director of soccer

coaching in England. He
discussed modern coaching
techniques.

In addition, Piranian was
able to learn how other coaches
recruit players, and run their
programs. He added that he
picked up some tips from the
clinics which he will apply to his
coaching strategy. Pirianiam
said he learned of some man-to-
man defensive tactics which he
hopes will help his team better
its 6-10 record of the past
season.

Piranian said he also learned
of the psychological aspects of
soccer which he hadn't given
much thought to prior to the
clinics. He said he plans to app-
ly psychological thinking to his
coaching efforts next year.

Although he learned a _ lot,
Piranian said some of the lec-
tures he heard convinced him
that various soccer techniques
he has stressed to his players at
W&L have been correct.

In addition to the many
clinics and lectures, Piranian
said that a number of other ac-
tivities kept the coaches busy.
Playoff formats and possible
rule changes were discussed,
business meetings were held,
and exhibits were set up by
various manufacturing com-
panies trying to sell equipment.

An awards banquet was also
held honoring the past-season’s
All-American soccer players.
Piranian said that one All-
American from the
Elizabethtown College soccer
team began hitchhiking Friday
at 5 p.m. along the snow-
covered highway from
Elizabethtown, Penn., and ar-
rived in Boston at 2 a.m. Satur-
day so that he could receive his
award at the banquet.

 
 

 

Cagers dismember Eagles

by Mark Mitchell

The Washington and Lee
basketball team gave the
Bridgewater Eagles a lesson in
team basketball while
thrashing the Eagles 105-77.

It was the second consecutive
105 point game for the Generals,
who played well in front of a
sparse crowd of approximately
150 people. W&L did not even
have to use an extraordinary
amount of defensive presssure
in order to score their 105 points
since their new offense was
working so well.

In the new set up, Pat Dennis
played point guard. The offense
got the ball into the middle of
the Bridgewater zone with
amazing consistency. Even
when the shot was missed, the
Generals usually came up with
the offensive rebound. Thus,
even though the Generals shot
only 44 percent for the game,
they scored most of the time
they came down the court. They
put up more shots than

Bridgewater 90 to 64, and outre-
bounded them 62 to 37.

The game was close only
when it was 7-6, Washington and
Lee leading. Then, Ardith Col-
lins scored two unanswered
baskets to give the Generals an
11-6 edge. The Generals main-
tained that five point margin
until there were just under ten
minutes left in the half. The
Generals then switched to a
half-court pressure defense
which totally overwheomed the
2-16 Eagles. The W&L lead
ballooned to fifteen points at
41-26 before the Generals mer-
cifully stopped their pressing.
The cagers went into the locker
room with a comfortable ten
point margin 47-37.

After intermission, the
Eagles were able to cut the lead
to eight at 57-49, but were
unable to launch any serious
threat.

They could not stop the
Generals from scoring and con-

trolling the offensive boards.
Specifically, they could not stop
Larry Meyer, who finished with
25 points and 12 rebounds and
Ardith Collins who finished with
19 points and 17 rebounds. Col-
lins played an inspired game,
jumping out of bounds to make
several saves of loose balls.
Meyer was unstopable when he
got the ball down low, hitting on
11 of 19 attempts from the floor,
including an amazing double-
pump shot.

In short, it was a good victory
to have coming into the Lyn-
chburg game. The Generals
played with enthusiasm and ex-
ecuted a new offensive pattern
amazing well, reflecting not on-
ly the fact that practices have
been very intensive, but also the
improvement in Dennis’ ball-
handling and passing skills.

Dennis had only 4 tunrovers,
while scoring 17 points and
dishing out 5 assists.

 

 

Generals beat Hornets

(continued from page 6)
down seven rebounds.

Most importantly, he kept the
Generals in the game for the
first three quarters, scoring
when All-American candidate
Pat Dennis couldn't.

Dennis, although he scored 21
points and was the game’s
leading scorer had a streaky
night from the floor, sometimes
forcing shots, but also bringing
the crowd to its feet with 30 foot
jump shots.

Sophomore Larry Meyers,
who finished with 15 points and
9 rebounds, helped the Generals
pull out to a 37-36 halftime lead
by scoring 10 points in the first
ten minutes. Moreover, he
helped Ardith Collins keep the
ODAC’s leading rebounder, Ed
Schechterly, from dominating
the boards and clogging up the
middle. Collins had eight re-
bounds and put in a nice turn-
around jump shot over the
outstrectched arms of the 6’9”’
Schechterly at an importnat

point in the game.
The Hornets held the lead
throughout the first three

quarters except for the few
times the Generals were able to
grab a one or two point ad-
vantage.

Then lLynchburg’s Wayne
Davis and W&L’s Pat Dennis
started trading baskets. The
Hornets played the entire se-
cond half without the services of
their star forward Crawford,
who had been on a 30 point per
game scoring binge in his last
couple of games. In the first
half Crawford had scored eight
of the Hornet’s first 17 points,
but then apparently he re-
injured his ankle which has
been bothering him all year. He
limped up and down the court
until Lynchburg coach Wayne
Proffitt took him out of the
game in the first half.

Lynchburg still managed to
hold the lead most of the game
without him, but it’s the end of
the game that counts and Lyn-
chburg began to tire and get in-

to foul trouble. Coach Proffitt
only substituted when he had to.
W&L’s coach Canfield sub-
situted every three or four
minutes with the likes of ‘‘T.J.”’
who made a nice move inside on
the towering Schechterly.
Schechterly went for the block
on the dipsy-doodle layup by
Jeffries’ but got nothing but a
sore hand from slamming it
against the backboard.

The Wayne Davis-Pat Dennis
matchup proved to be the
game’s offensive highlight.
With Davis dogging Dennis all
over the court, he made Pat
force some shots. Much to
Davis’ frustration, however,
Dennis would hit some of those
patented long bombs.

The Generals are now 6-1 in
ODAC play. Lynchburg slipped
to 4-2. The Generals with a win
over ODAC foe Eastern Men-
nonite here tonight, could wrap
up that all-important first place
inthe ODAC.

In the ODAC tournament, to —

be played in March, the first-
seeded team, probably W&L,
plays the fourth place team.

men to “dwell on  pseudo-
philosophical and...moralistic
aspects of...problems”’ and are
“unwilling to deal with tangible
elements.”’ Finally, a professor
summed up the sentiments of
his collegues by saying
“teaching women would be ex-
ceptionally difficult and pain-
ful.”’

without obligation as opposed to
loan, which must be repaid.)
John also said that grants are
often awarded to minority
students without the usual
academic stipulations placed on
non-minority student scholar-
ships.

In a telephone interview, Van
Haigler Pate, Assistant Dean of
Students and Director of Stu-
dent Financial Aid, confirmed
John’s statement about
academic stipulations saying
that in spite of the large por-
tions of grant awarded to
minority students, ‘‘There’s not
really an academic stipula-
tion.”

A non-minority financial aid
recipient risks having his grant
reduced significantly if his
grades fall below a two-point
average.

Pate also stated that the pro-
tion of grant awarded to any
student is based entirely on
financial need, and not race or
ethnic origin. He said that the
majority of minority students
are from substantially disad-
vantaged backsgrounds.

In reference to the ‘‘special

ug?

preference” given to minority
applicants, Dean Huntley ex-
plained that it is justified by the
valuable diversity of
backgroupd it aids in lending
the student body. He claimed
the administration feels
preferential treatment of sons
of alumni is justified as an ex-
pression of gratitude for the in-
valuable role alumni play in the
financial support of Washington

and Lee. Lexington and
Rockbridge County area
residents are given what

Huntley termed ‘‘a break in tui-
tion,” in addition, to ‘special
preference” category status.
He explained this policy as a
‘‘public relations action’ which
fulfills the University’s ‘‘obliga-
tion to the community.”

Asked if efforts to recruit
minority students could result
in cases of reverse discrimina-
tion, Dean Huntley acknowledg-
ed the danger of that possibility,
but said, ‘‘I have never known
of any student who didn’t get
here simply because there was
a less qualified Italian, black or
Indian who entered at that stu-
dent’s expense. I say that flat
out.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Antibody or Anti-body?

The Admissions Committee is a school’s antibody. It is supposed
to fight off the disease of quality applicant decline. Yet, this year’s
Admissions department has failed to do so, as indicated by the
virulent 40 percent drop in applications. And that is only the official
estimate. One Admissions Committee faculty member has told the
Ring-tum Phi that the number of applications has plummetted by
56 percent.

No matter what Admissions people say, a decline of that
magnitude will affect the quality of next year’s freshman class. As
Dave McLean, student member of the Admissions Committee,
pointed out, W&L has traditionally been a back-up school for
students rejected by the Ivy Leagues. He believes that much of the
admissions slump can be attributed to prospective Ivy Leaguers’
unwillingness to fill out a new 500 word essay question. His argue-
ment seems logical because there are many schools of W&L’s
caliber which have less demanding forms.

But don’t believe the essay is the only reason the number of ap-
plications and the quality of the applicants are down. The quality of
applicants (as measured by SAT scores) has been falling for years.
While declining scores is a national trend, W&L’s SATs over the
past 10 years have dropped by 70 points, while the nation’s have
dropped by 50 points. And, while Ken Ruscio says this year’s SATs
are up, it must be remembered that a large portion of those
students who have submitted their SAT scores so far are early ad-
mission candidates. Early admission applicants normally have
significantly higher SAT scores than students who turn in applica-
tions near deadline time.

Over the same time period in which quality of applicants has
been declining, the number of applicants has also dropped off
significantly. While W&L used to reject more than half its ap-
plicants, it now accepts close to 60 percent.

Declining numbers and declining quality are related. It is like the
formation of a vortex: Watered down numbers of applicants start
the momentum of the vortex until W&L is ultimately pulled down
into the vacuum of declining quality. For, no matter what the
caliber of teaching is, it is ultimately the intelligence of individual
students which determines how effective that instruction can be.
But before W&L can aviod the vortex of declining standards, tradi-
tional admission criteria must change.

The Admission Committee should still act as the school’s an-
tibody. But its traditional stance ‘“‘anti’’ only to one type of body
should change; women should be allowed into W&L. Besides open-
ning up a new pool of quality female applicants, more men would
apply here. Ever since W&L started worrying about declining
numbers, it has sent a survey to those who were accepted but decid-
ed not to come. And every year the major reason for rejecting
W&L has been the lack of not because they were accepted by
another school. Not because they decided to take a year But
because this school doesn’t accept women.

Well it’s time this school enter the 20th Century; time this school
accept women. They’re here on Earth. They live. They breathe.
And yes, Board of Trustees, they even think. What’s more, they
would improve the academic quality of W&L by attracting more
male applicants and by adding their own intellectual powers which
Administration officials, faculty members, and students too often
calumniate.

Responses to editorial outcry

Law News editor replies

Dear Editor:

Your honor editorial in last
week’s issue of the Ring-tum
Phi may have created a
misconception regarding the
results of the Law News honor
survey. The article seemed to
portray law school dissatisfac-
tion with the present honor
system as a product of a belief
that trial by the EC is not a trial
by ‘‘a jury of peers.”’ If the Law
News survey is a valid sampl-
ing, concern over whether
honor trials are before our
peers is, at best, minimal. By
emphasizing this minor ques-
tion, you have given undue at-
tention to an aspect of the pro-
blem that is capable of eliciting
emotional, rather than reason-
ed, responses.

As reflected in the survey, the
law school’s dissatisfaction
with the honor system focuses
primarily the question of
fairness. The fairness question
involves concern over ambigui-
ty in standards to guide con-
duct, concern over procedural
problems, and concern over
consequences of conviction.

Law school sentiment sup-
porting a separate honor
system reflects a desire to be
governed by a. fairer system,
not fear that a trial before the
EC will not be before a jury of
‘peers. The principal question is
fairness, not separation or

juried of peers. Future discus- _

sion about the honor system

might be more fruitful if
fairness was the focus.

Virtuous
qualities
desired

Dear Editor:

Often I have sat in my room
pondering upon the virtuous
qualities desirable in a woman,
even upon the gentle methods
ideally I would use to enchant
and bequile a lovely child into
going out with me; that is, if I
had the riches, and the guts. Of
course, I would like to make it
perfectly clear, however, that
my pondering takes up nowhere
near 30 percent of my wakeful
hours, nor any of my conversa-

tion, otherwise my thoughts .

would.greatly infringe upon my
academic duties. No, these
revelations only come to me
when I have become totally
disenchanted with my studies,
or else when I have reached the
pits of mental anguish.

Anyway, to those of us of the
weaker sex who are awkward,

immature, unobrusive, and just
plain chicken, the situation is
hopeless. We sit alone in our
rooms night after night waiting
for that one in a million chance
that a beautiful gir] will walk up
the stairs, look into our eyes,
and FLASH! ecstasy prevails.
Our lives will have meaning
again.

Impossible.

Are there any miraculous
remedies for those of us trapped
by our own _ inadequacies
without female companion-
ship? I doubt it. Let us look at
the facts sifted from a typical
survey of stereotypical women.
One, there are no brave, new,
liberated women who walk
down the street with an all con-
quering glint in their eyes and a
pert “‘je ne sais quoi’’ in their
step; none who will assert
themselves and lead us poor,
cowering fools aright, nor even
any who will make a simple
telephone call to help remedy
an evil situation. NO! It ap-
pears that 90 percent or so of the
women are sheep who go to par-
ties they hate, and date people
who make them sick to their
stomachs. Why? Simply
because it’s expected of them,
cause it’s the ‘‘in’’ thing to do.
They must join the crowd; to be
ostracized (no matter how un-
conciously) is a horrible fate.
Besides, they can’t think of
anything better to do.

Who could ever find a good
book to read where they come
from? There certainly are no
facilities for any physical ac-
tivities; it would be impossible
to get a volleyball game going.
The flicks in that vicinity of
Virginia are dull and
disgusting, even more so than
their prospective dates. Face it,

Letters to Editor

(continued from page 8)

the poor women are stuck in a
city where nothing’s happening.

Unfortunately, the women
aren’t the only ones in such bad
straits, there truly isn’t very
much going on in Lexington,
either; except those cursed frat
parties, also one could always
lounge around the Cockpit to
wait for a good band. While liv-
ing in this limbo, almost
everyone seems to have a
strange desire to be around peo-
ple of the opposite sex, which
I'll call normalcy. Meanwhile,
they also enjoy complaining
about any thing that does or
does not occur during their
monotony, which action I will
classify as a spoiled attitude.
Why compalin? Perfection is
not just around the corner. All
things considered, we chose the
life we now lead; and we can un-
choose it, if we so desire; or we
can create from it something a
little more appreciated by our
own senses.

Some necessary changes are
blatantly obvious (a change in
attitude, for example, as my
father once said, ‘‘Don’t be a
loser just because everyone else
is.”’) If girls don’t like parties
they should suggest someplace
else for their dates to take
them, and create a location for
mingling. I’m sure the Fairfax
Lounge could be used to discuss
the virtues of Bertolt Brecht
and Karl Marx. Maybe they
could recruit some boys for
some sporting activities, like a

volleyball match. A committee
should be formed to organize
mixers and other asexual
events between campuses. And
most important, women must
have the strength of their con-
victions to go on a hike instead
of to a party, become a
vegetarian, or to do what
pleases them with who pleases
them. Life is not a bed of roses,
but if you do what you want to
you can’t complain. Men are
awkward, immature, _in-
considerate, indifferent,
shallow, selfish and_ totally
tedious. This just means that
women must work all the
harder employing all their
charms and virtues which they
possess in such abundance to
reform us hapless fools.

As for me, life continues. I re-
main the quiet, considerate,
bouyant, boyishly handsome
young man I always was. Liv-
ing in the dreams I always lived
in. Let others find themselves,
for my life will never be fulfill-
ed. I’m afraid that scenario was
played out for the last time
around 20 years ago.

Wistfully yours,
Ivan de Bussy
Class of 1901

Steve Abraham was not in-
cluded in an honor trial hearing
Sunday night. Steve was quite
upset about not being invited.
Rumor has it that the case will
be hard again so he can be
there.

A recently graduated ad-
ministration figure reportedly
reportedly had his first date ina
long time Saturday night. No
one is quite sure how the date
went, but we do know who took
care of the kids.

EC officials will soon request
Student Control chairman Jim
MeNider to account for some of
his overzealous investigative
practices. Signing statements
and taped hearings under the
auspices of the honor system
could be a violation of one’s con-
stitutional rights if some of our
law students know what they
are talking about. Many nerve-
wrecked students have likened
the ‘‘knock in the night’’ to the
KGB.

The Nose Knows

who likes to take bus trips down

stories to tell. The only problem
is no one believes him.

A junior EC member has been
in the hospital again, or at least
that is what we have been led to
believe. Actually, he disap-
peared from campus so he can
make a grand appearance and
campaign announcement at the
same time. He has his sights on
the presidency. He won’t have
an easy campaign though. The
law school is secretly grooming
its own candidate. Don’t know
officially who it is, but the
money should be on Jackie
Boyden. Matt Calvert, an alum-
nus, is also frequently mention-
ed.

Nature go its way.

Advertising in the Ring-tum

still hadn’t returned from their

M.C. plans activities, speakers

by Jim Parker

The Mock Convention may
not have any speakers this
year, but they could very likely
have a distinguished senator as
speaker next year. Senator
Howard Baker of Tennessee,
campaigning for Congressional
re-election, will not speak at
W&L this year, but he promised
the Mock Convention that he
would lecture here in 1979. He is
one of three people contacted as
potential speakers to be spon-
sored by the Mock Convention
this year, according to Jim
MeNider, chairman of the 1980
Mock Convention. McNider said
the two potential speakers
besides Baker are not likely to
speak this year, although the
decision on one is still pending.
If there is a Mock Convention
sponsored lecture this year, it

selected Mark as a competitor
for one of the two slots to repre-
sent the state of Virginia in the
competition. Bradley traveled
to Richmond for the first phase
of elimination, and was selected
over 11 other applicants to
represent Virginia. Mark then
traveled to Atlanta for the final
regional competition for the
scholarship. In Atlanta Mark
was subject to the 12 hours of in-
tensive interviews and ques-
tioning.

“The Board even asked me
questions about Lexington and
Washington and Lee. They went
so far as to ask me who a street
was named after, and why,”
said Bradley.

Bradley said he was confident
that he was as prepared as his
competitors for the Rhodes. He
said he knew coming from
Washington and Lee, he would
be on an equal footing in the
competition.

The last W&L man to become
a Rhodes scholar was Ralph H.
Smith, in 1973. The Rhodes
scholarship was first awarded
in 1904, and is named after the
British philanthropist Cecil
Rhodes. Rhodes scholars are
chosen on the basis of scholar-
ship, athletic participation,
character and leadership.

Bradley will study for two
years at Oxford in England on
the scholarship. Mark said his
first choice of college at Oxford
was Corpus Christi. He plans to
study modern history during his
stay.

“You have a tutor you meet
with every week. You both sit
down and design your schedule.
I’m really looking forward to
the independent study program
after having to get up for ‘B’
hour for four years,’’ Bradley
admitted.

Mark said he wouldn’t be stu-
dying the whole time he is in
England. He plans to travel as
much as possible.

“It boils down to about six
months of study and six months
of travel each year,” he said.

will occur most likely in March
or May.

This year the Mock Conven-
tion may fail to bring a speaker
to W&L, but the organization is
promoting some other ac-
tivities. In March, there will be
a research seminar in co-
operation with the research
assistants in the library. The
seminar will acquaint members
of the Mock Convention with
how to conduct political
research. Furthermore, there is
an idea formulating that the
Mock Convention sponsor in-
ternships for its members. Most
likely the internships would be
political in nature, such as

working for a Senator or

Representative, whether na-
tional or state. If this suggestion

is used, the operation of it will
begin during the Spring of 1979.

The culmination of the Mock
Convention’s work occurs, of
course, in 1980, the year of the
presidential elections. Work has
already begun towards 1980, but
Jim MeNider said it is never too
late to join the Mock Conven-
tion, and he is encouraging peo-
ple to enlist as soon as possible.
For anyone interested in work-
ing on the Mock Convention,
contact one of the ad-
ministrative assistants. They
are Craig Cornett, Dick
Schoenfeld, and Sid Simmons.
Efforts by these 2rd other peo-
ple will finally rs--alt in the 1980
Mock Convention, a revealing
prelude to the actual presiden-
tial elections in November.

weeks ago. He said the first
thing he did when learning
about it was to write to the
Fulbright board to ask if he
could delay the scholarship un-
til he finished at Oxford. Mark
said that in his letter he asked
the Fulbright board to give his
scholarship to someone else if
they couldn’t delay it.

“I wanted someone else who
wouldn’t be able to have the
Fulbright to have it if I couldn’t.
The Rhodes is the big thing,”
Bradley explained.

Earlier in his life, Bradley
was known around Virginia not
as a scholar, but as a boxer.
Bradley said he had a 65-1
record as a welterweight from
1972 to 1976. Mark got interested
in boxing through a high school
football coach.

Mark said the high point in his
boxing career was knocking out
the champion from Puerto
Rico. His low point came when
he knocked out an opponent in a

now is in connection with
teaching kids how to box at the
Roanoke YMCA.

“Boxing is a good way to get
kids interested in self-respect. I
learned a lot of patience dealing
with the kids, and I learned how
lucky I am by seeing children
from really poor homes,”
Bradley said.

Between graduation and star-
ting at Oxford, Bradley plans to
engage in the romantic old
Anglo-Saxon dream of running
off tosea.

“I’m going to go to Argentina
for a little while, with the Mer-
chant Marines, just for a
change of pace. It will let me do
some reading and I'll come
back refreshed and ready to
roll,” Bradley explained.

reason applications aren’t com-

years,”’ Ruscio said. ‘“‘We think
it (the essay) is more of a delay-
ing factor than an inhibiting
one.”

The athletic department has
also cut down on its recruiting
this year, cited Ruscio. Athletic
Director Bill McHenry, who
normally does the bulk of the
football recruiting, has devoted
much of his time this year seek-

ing someone to succeed him as
head football coach. Athletic
recruiting has suffered as a
result.

Other factors, such as the new
national standardized financial
aid forms not being available
until Jan. 1 and the decline na-
tionally of college-age students,
also have had some effect,
Ruscio believes.

argue that the lack of coeduca-

tion has finally caught-up with
us,’’ he said.

Statistics lend some support
to that statement. Of 194
students accepted to W&L in
1976 who did not attend the
school, 57 percent gave as their
main reason the lack of
coeducation.

The large drop in applications
has put more pressure on the
school’s admissions depart-
ment. This has resulted in
longer and more frequent
recruiting trips outside the
state. Ruscio represented
Washington and Lee at college
night in Chicago and
Philadelphia in November and
December.

admissions, Danny Murphy,
has traveled to Atlanta, and H.
R. Huntley, assistant dean of
students, has made recruiting
trips to Winston-Salem, N.C.,
Charlotte, N.C., and Columbia,
S.C.

The Student Recruitment
Committee, headed by senior
Mark Putney and junior Steve
Jones, also has been working
harder. Two scholarship
weekends, when the school’s top
academic applicants stay with
a member of the committee for
a weekend at school expense,
are planned for March.

Washington and Lee accepts
an average of 700 students an-
nually, but Ruscio doesn’t feel

the decline in applications will
affect the quality of next year’s
freshman class.

“That’s the logical conclu-
sion, that the drop in applica-
tions will result in our being less
selective,” he said.

“But, in fact, the average
SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test)
scores of this year’s applicants
seem higher than last year’s,”
he continued. ‘‘We’ve even
received an application from a
guy with 800 on his boards who
has us as his first choice of
schools,”’ he said. A mark of 800
on the test is the highest one can
score.

“We'll just keep our fingers
crossed and hope for the best,”
Ruscio said.

W&L Rumors...

Rumors... Rumors

Was W&L ever listed as the
top drinking school in the coun-
try? Yes, according to Bob
Keefe. In the early 1960s W&L
made it on that list of dubious
distinction. Playboy printed the
list, however W&L has not ap-
peared since.

Pee eeereresececceccscseseesoeceeeeeeseses

Ever hear that W&L was
ranked as the seventh best
school in the country by the
New York Times a few years
ago? Well it’s not true.

Accoridng to Bob Keefe,
News Information Director, in
1954 W&L was listed as one of
the best schools in the country.
It was listed In the Chicago
Tribune as the sixth best male
undergraduate school in the
United States. Keefe pointed out
that was when there were quite
a few all-male colleges.

As far as he knows, there has
been no similar list printed

recently, he said.

 

Lots of people seem to think
that the only reason we have a
spring semester is for the
lacrosse players to run around
in their shorts without having
undue academic pressure plac-
ed on their macho shoulders.
But the real reason, according
to Keefe, is that W&L has found
a short term in the middle of the
year to be totally unworthwhile.
Keefe says this is particulary
true for the science depart-
ments.

How could the geology
department tour the coun-
tryside during the winter, he
syas. Also the  archaelogy
department goes on its digs.
Besides, says Keefe, the foreign
language trips to Europe are
made more worthwhile by vir-
tue of the fact they can stay
there for the entire summer

(continued from page 3)
agreed, saying there should be
“strict criterion” as to what
constitutes an honor violation.
He said it should be made as
clear as possible what specific
actions would initiate honor
trial proceedings.

George Griffin and Jim
Underhill made clear their posi-
tion against codification of the
honor system. They said that
honor has to be decided by the
student generation in question
and any attempt to codify it
would hinder changing student
generation perceptions as to
what is honorable.

Griffin and Underhill were
also against suggestions of a
graduated system of honor
penalties. Griffin said he could

chew the fat

not possibly decide whether
plagiarism is worse than steal-
ing, yet that distinction would
have to be made if the honor
system is to include graduated
penalties. Underhill added that
he believes absolute penalties
have a deterrent effect that
graduated penalties would not.

Despite all the afternoon’s
rhetoric, little was accomplish-
ed except a clearing of the air
and the opening up, to a certain
extent, of the lines of com-
munication between
undergraduate and law school
leaders. The law school cannot
adopt its own honor system, ac-
cording to Swope, unless the
Board of Trustees grants it per-
mission to do so.

Frat houses deteriorating

(continued from page 2)
over all maintenance of all the
fraternity houses over to
Buildings and Grounds; (3)
recommend that all fraternities
donate their houses over to the
care and supervision of the
University; and (4) create a
checklist maintenance system
with a punitive mechanism to

insure compliance with
maintenance recommenda-
tions.

“University policy has been
to allow as much freedom to the
individual and fraternity as
possible,’’ Dean Murphy said in
explaining why the fourth op-
tion was chosen. He emphasized
that the University is sup-
portive of the fraternity system,
and that under the checklist op-
tion the fraternities ‘“‘will still
retain.their independence.”’

“But there must be a good-

trary. “There are many coun-
tries that keep secrets that are
harmful to the United States’
that cannot be photographed or
learned,”’ he said. Colby also
said, ‘‘Our advanced
technology has enabled us to
overcome many barriers and
gather much-needed informa-
tion.”

Colby said in the 1980s and
“90s, we’ll be sharing our planet
with not only the Soviet Union
and China, but with many other
superpowers as well, notably
Brazil and Iran.

‘The Soviet Union now pro-
duces more oil and steel than
any country in the world, in-
cluding our own,’ Colby
reiterated. ‘‘Besides,”’ he said,

“great power is becoming
available in small packages--
nuclear, biological, and

chemical. Without our careful
surveilance , these packages
could fall into the hands of a
reckless despot, seeking his

share of the world’s goods.”’ If

this were the case then the
world ‘‘will not be safe for our
democracy,” he said.

“With knowledge we'll be
able to solve upcoming pro-
blems,”’ he said, ‘‘and be able to
defend ourselves against a
threat before it occurs.”

Colby said he thinks the effect
of good intelligence gathering
will help us get problems to the
negotiating table with the
Soviet Union or anyone else, so
we can solve them together.

One example of this is the
SALT I agreement in which the
United States and the Soviet
Unoin agreed not to develop a
nationwide anti-balistic missile
system, Colby said, ‘‘and
neither of us have , at a saving
of $50-100 billion for taxpayers.”

Colby also said CIA abuses in
the past four years have been
exagerated and sensationalized
in the press, giving the
American public a confused and
clouded image of the CIA’s pur-
pose.

fraternities,’ Dean Murphy
continued. He noted that last
year a list of maintenance
recommendations were
presented to each fraternity
and that one year later, many of
the Priority I (most important)
items still had not been attend-
ed to.

The exact nature of the
punitive measure for frater-
nities that do not correct
maintenance deficiencies
outlined on the monthly
checklists has still not been
determined.

One suggested method of ad-
ministering the new fraternity
maintenance system is that the
checklists be submitted to the
Judicial Board of the Inter-
fraternity Council. Failures to
comply would be reported to the
IFC for corrective action,
allowing the IFC to administer
the entire program.

The Fraternity Inspection
Committee, which is supposed
to make two official inspections
a year, would then make unan-
nounced spot-checks of selected
fraternities to guarantee com-
pliance with the checklist
recommendations. They will

also make additional recom-
mendations concerning more

major structural problems
(such as plumbing and
heating).

Fraternities caught during
the spot-checks for having
given false information on com-
pleted checklist forms may be
referred directly to either the
Student Control Committee or
che Student Affairs Committee
for punitive action.

In reference to some of the
costly remodeling recommen-

dations made in the fire and
safety report, Dean Murphy
said that the administration
realizes that all fraternity
houses met fire and safety stan-
dards at the time of their con-
struction, although those stan-
dards may have changed since
then. The desire is, however, for
minimum safety standards to
be met and further structural
deterioration be arrested. .

. ‘‘We’re trying to support the
fraternities as much as possi-
ble,’’ Dean Murphy said.
