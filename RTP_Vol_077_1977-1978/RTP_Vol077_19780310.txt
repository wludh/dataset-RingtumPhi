‘Big Three” Elections Monday

Candidates
on issues

by Lee Howard,
Randy Smith & Jim Barnes

Petitions from students runn-
ing for positions in next Mon-
day’s ‘Big Three” Elections
were accepted by the Executive
Committee this week.

_ For President of next year’s

Student government, the EC
received and accepted peitions
from: Jack Bovey, Junior EC
representative; Bo Dudley, a
W&L law student; and Mike
Gallagher, editor of the Ring-
tum Phi.

Two petitions were submitted
for the Vice presidential spot
from Bill Tucker, chairman of
the Student Activities Board,
and Pete Williams, president of
the junior class.

Andy Bodenstab, sophomore
EC representative, was the only
person to submit an application
for secretary.

Tom McCarthy and Bill Pax-
ton were late entries for the
secretary's position, joining the
race yesterday. Both are write-
in candidates.

Are you in favor of increasing
freshmen representation on the
EC to two representatives?

Bovay: No. “I stand by the
old argument that committee
appointment and appropria-
tions have already been made
by the time freshmen are
elected”” and that the 12-
member EC can function more
effectly than a larger body.”

Dudley: Yes. ;

IFC vote,
Frats decide
Pres. Monday

Elections for next year’s In-
terfraternity Council president
and vice president will be held
on Monday in conjunction with
the Big Three Election.

Two candidates for each posi-
tion were nominated at Tues-
day’s IFC meeting. For presi-
dent, Jim Davis of Phi Kappa
Sigma, and Andy Fitzgerald of
Phi Kappa Psi were nominated.
The vice presidential can-
didates are Doug Seitz of Phi
Gamma Delta, and Rick Huck
of Beta Theta Pi.

The IFC will post candidate
posters itself in an effort to
maintain a “‘low key”’ election.
By majority vote, it was decid-
ed that there would be not
voting or polling regulations,
and the candidates would carry
ona ‘verbal’ campaign.

A victor will be chosen by a
popular vote of all fraternity
members.

Gallagher: Yes. The reason
for this is that I think freshmen
are entitled to just as much
representation as any other
part of the student body. They
are just as much a part of the
student body as any class.

Tucker: Yes. Bill Tucker says
he agrees with the proposal of
the law school recently submit-
ted to the EC which called for
an increase in the number of

tional representative each. “I
think by adding two members to
the EC the law school is attemp-
ting to get another resolution
passed which I am also in favor
of and that’s the initial in-

vestigating team of three in-
quirers,’’ two of whom would be
EC members and one of whom
would be president of the accus-
ed student’s school:
School, Commerce School, Art
and Sciences. Tucker said that
the 14-man EC and two EC in-
vestigators who don’t vote,
there will still be 12 members to
vote on the case. He said that is
good ‘‘so the EC wouldn’t have
to jiggle with ratios.”’

Williams: Yes. ‘‘I’d lean in
favor of increased representa-
tion.” Although Williams says
he has reservations because it
might be difficult to keep the
size of the EC manageable, he
says there are no ‘‘overwhelm-

  

Greene questions
reporters’ ethics

by Lee Howard

‘‘T suppose I have been called
on to talk about ethics because
people say I haven’t any,”’ Bob
Greene, famous investigative
crime reporter, and an editor of
Newsday, said to a delighted
audience of 75 journalists at Lee
Chapel Monday night.

Nevertheless, Greene, coor-
dinator of the widely-publized
‘Arizona Report,’ a group of
articles which explored the web
of official and mob-linked cor-
ruption in Arizona, gave his
views on the state of journalism

ehtics. What he had to say was
not exactly complimentary.

The rotund, animated
Greene, one of a series of
speakers this year sponsored by
the W&L chapter of the Society
of Professional Journalists
(Sigma Delta Chi) and the jour-
nalism ethics program, chastis-
ed journalists for accepting
“freebies.’”’

“Freebies” (free meals and
free trips received-from com-
panies that want good publici-
ty) are inimicable to unbiased

ing’’ arguments against it.

Are you in favor of salaries
for editors of publications?

Bovay: No. “I’m opposed to
any salary for any student who
serves on a student commit-
tee.”

_ Dudley: Yes.

Gallagher: Yes. I think that it
may be a good incentive for so-
meon who wanted the job, and
certainly for a person in the
middle of the year whose
grades have suffered, for them
to carry on.

Tucker: Yes. “But I think
perhaps a closer tab should be
kept and a public disclosure of
salaries both potential and

Referendums,
opinion poll

on EC ballot

by Randy Smith

Discussion of Monday’s elec-
tion and ballot additions
highlighted this week’s Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting.

On Monday’s ballot will be
two referendums for increasing
EC representation and an ‘‘opi-
nion poll’’ concerning a possible
change in the honor code.

The two referendums propos-
ed an increase in the represen-
tation of the freshman class
from one to two, and increasing
the law school’s representation
from two to three. A referen-
dv) vote is needed because
Lv involve changes in the con-
stitution.

George Griffin’ vice-
president of the EC, argued
against the addition of a second
freshman representative noting
that the ‘‘bulk of the Ec’s work
(such as subcommittee appoint-
ments and budget appropria-
tions) has already been com-
pleted by the time the freshman
representative comes to the
committee. Jim Underhill,
president of the Executive Com-
mittee, cautioned that most
honor trials involve freshmen,
and that additional members of
the committee may make it:
“‘less efficient.”’

Statements in support of two
freshmen representatives were
conspiciously lacking.

However, many law school
representatives were present

Fancy Dress change
ignites controversy

by Galen Trussell

Discussion on a proposal that
would force Fancy Dress Ball to
take place during George
Washington holiday was
postponed by the University
Council at its meeting last
Thursday.

The proposal, which states,
“be it resolved that the various
parts of ‘Fancy Dress Weekend’
occur only during the
‘Washington Holiday’,’’ will be
discussed at the council’s next
regular meeting in April.

According to John Sacco, the
student head of the University
Council, the proposal was writ-
ten by professors Beckley and
Sessions. Both Beckley and Ses-
sions said they wrote up the pro-
posal because they believe Fan-
cy Dress disrupts academic life
prior to, and after it occurs.

Sacco said the proposal came
out of a concern by faculty for
what they. feel is a lack of
motivation during the week bet-
ween Winter Break and Fancy
Dress. Sacco said he agreed

with the faculty about the
motivation problem. He also
believed there were problems
with attendance during the
Thursday and Friday before the
event.

‘“‘A matter like this can easily
be blown out of proportion.”
Sacco said. He added that when
approached about the proposal,
the first reaction by students
was, ‘‘What are you trying to
do?” Sacco said after he ex-
plained the actions taken in
drawing up the proposal, stu-
dent reaction was less severe.
Sessions and Beckley agreed
with Sacco in his belief that the
reasons behind the proposal
needed more explanation to be

fully understood.
Beckley and Sacco agreed the
proposal was posted to

stimulate student discussion on
the idea, not to inform them the
proposal was being imposed on
them. Sessions said students
should not think of the proposal
as an attempt to take away part

Jack Bovay

Jack Bovay says the Ex-,
ecutive Committee has to com-
bine a ‘“‘concern for the rights of
the accused student with a con-
cern for the opinion toward
honor of the student generation
here at W&L.”

The EC presidential can-
didate says this year has been
one in which the EC ‘“‘taken on
the role of watchdog over those
committees that receive stu-
dent body funds.’’ He says he
sees the role of the EC in that
regard continuing:’’We have to
make sure the committee
chairmen are aware of the ac-
counting guidelines and that
they are aware of the fact that
their meetings are open. The
EC ad hoc members have got to
go to committee meetings and
go over the books and make
sure that no indiscrepancies oc-
eur.”

Bovay says he is more
qualified than his opponents
because he has a ‘working
knowledge of the honor system
and the commitee system.’’ As
he says, ‘I have a thorough
understanding of the White
Book. In terms of student
government, I feel I have a good
working knowledge of commit-
tees and budgeting and the new
accounting guidelines.

An effective orientation of-
freshmen law students and
undergraduates is his first
priority, Bovay said. ‘I don’t
know what kind of mail-outs
they get the summer before
they get here,’’ Bovay says. “I
would like to see each law stu-
dent have a copy of the constitu-
tion and the student handbook,”
he adds.

But the information process
should begin at Natural Bridge,
Bovay says, and at law school
orientation. “‘We must make
sure they understand the (honor
system) is not a set of rules. It’s
more a spirit and a way of life.”
He says speeches and a mock
honor trial should be held to in-
form students thoroughly on the
honor system.

“T think the reorientation of
freshmen before exams and the
letter home to all students
reminding them of honor viola-
tions concerning independent
exams were very helpful.’’

One other way he would like
to see the honor system upheld
is by speaking with “each
newly-elected EC member to
make sure he understands the
fairness aspect(of the honor
sysem)’” with respect to not
disclosing the names of honor
defendents. He says he thinks it
was very wrong for Mike Missal

Bo Dudley

The law school candidate for
president in the ‘‘Big Three’’
election on Monday, Waller
“Bo” Dudley, has shifted his
stance on the proposal that the
law school have three E.C.
representatives next year.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi on Tuesday, Dudley
said that the argument for three
representatives ‘‘falls flat on its
face in numerical terms; no one
else has three E.C. represen-«
tatives for 300 people.”’

However, Dudley called the
News Office Wednesday to say
that he had changed his mind.
He now supports three law
school representatives on the
E.C. as a way of unifying the
undergraduates and the law
school. He also said that
undergraduates he had spoken
with had not seemed opposed to
the law school having three
representatives. Students will
have a chance to voice their opi-
nion in a referendum vote in-
cluded on the ballot.

Dudley, who graduated from
W&L in 1974, is concerned about
“leaks” of honor trial results.
As president, he would tighten
security during an honor trial
by setting setting guidelines to
prevent honor proceedings
from becoming public
knowledge. ‘‘It’s time for the
Executive Committee to have a

  

strong leader,’’ he said,
“instead of letting the Commit-
tee run itself.”’

On the Hulfish honor case,
Dudley accused the Executive
Committee of acting “‘irrespon-
sibly’’ because ‘‘they did not act
strongly and quickly”’ to resolve
the matter.

The candidate also ranks as a
top priority the improvement of
town-gown relations. After
graduating from W&L, Dudley
worked in the Virginia state
legislature. He thinks his ex-
perience in the legislature gives
him an edge in dealing with the
Lexington City Council to ex-
tend the noise ordinance. ‘I’ve
dealt more with older people’
than the other candidates, he
said, and hopes he can keep a
meeting from becoming “a
shouting match.”

The use of the gymnasium
takes a high priority on
Dudley’s platform. ‘‘I think our

Two students vie
For vice-president

Bill Tucker

Bill Tucker says his first
priority as EC vice president
would be to work on changes in
the honor system.

Tucker says he is in favor of
most of the law school’s propos-
ed honor code revisions with the
exception of their stance
against making a remark on the
school records of someone con-
victed in a public honor trial.

“T am of the opinion that
when a student is convicted in
private it is more or less given a
gift in that it’s not public
knowledge of his conviction and
when he goes public he loses
that gift,” he said.

Tucker says he has worked
very closely with the EC on
some honor cases as well as on
matters concerning the SAB.
He says his opponent, Pete
Williams, has no experience
working with the EC on finan-
cial matters. He indicates that
Williams might be ‘‘soft’’ on
honor cases by saying, ‘‘In Stu-
dent Control he might be
borderline on some _ honor
cases.”’ Tucker adds, “I have
yet to see Pete at an EC
meeting except for near elec-
tion time.”’

Tucker says he has only miss-
ed on EC general meeting all
year and has shown his concern
with the honor system by atten-
ding a honor code seminar down
in Lewis Hall. He said he will

try to uphold the honor code by
trying to keep students inform-
ed. He says it’s difficult to
discuss changes in the White
Book that law students are sug-
gesting because most. students
don’t understand what the
previous procedure has been.

Tucker said the best way to
maintain independent exams is
to maintain the integrity of the
honor system. If a student is
dishonorable, “‘get him out,”
Tucker says.

As EC vice president, one of
Tucker’s most important jobs is
to keep the books. He says he is
very familiar with the EC’s ac-
counting procedures because of
his contact with the SAB and
because he has worked over at
Washington Hall filling out
computer print-put forms.

Maintaining a balance in the
EC reserve funding would be
one of his main goals, Tucker
says. ‘“‘There’s been a tendency
to throw it away to much,”
Tucker said. He adds that the
SAB is one of the committees
that gets too much money. He
Says one of the reasons for this
is that committees rely on how
much was spent last year

Mike Gallagher

On the campaign trial he
declares himself to be a man of
action. He says that he is the
candidate who will take a stand
on all the issues. The man is
none other
PhiEditor-in-Chief J. Michael
Gallagher. Gallagher projects
this image of dynamism when
questioned on his motivation
and qualities for running for
student body president.

When asked why he was runn-
ing for the E.C. leadership post
Gallagher responded, “I think
that the E.C. has lacked effec-
tive leadership. I think through
the Ring-tum Phi, we’ve ef-
fected change, but it’s been in-
direct change. I’m running for
student body president for more
direct action by the E.C.”’ Ask-
ed what qualities he had that
would make him a good presi-
dent, Gallagher replied, ‘‘I feel
I’m a very dynamic individual.
I know as much if not more
about student government than
the present E.C. members, as
has been pointed out in some of
the editorial stances I have
taken.”’

Gallagher said that his first
priority as E.C. president would
be to “‘reorient the student body
to the value and traditions of the
honor code.’’ He elaborated on
this point saying, ‘‘I think the
first year law students need to

   
   

Pete Williams

“T’ve served on the Student
Control Committee for a couple
of years. Sometimes I’ve been
frustrated because there are a
lot of things that you can’t do as
a member of Student Control
that you could do as a member
of the Executive Committee,”
says Pete Williams, candidate
for vice-president of the E.C.

Williams is interested in play-
ing a part in the procedural
changes in the honor system.
His first priority as vicepresi-
dent would be to clarify and
codify the rights of defendants
“to the point where his rights
are clearly outlined.”’

The present junior class
president is also worried about
the entire ‘‘committee struc-
ture.’’ He accused the faculty
and who dominate the Student
Affairs Committee, of “‘usurp-
ing’’ the powers of Student Con-

than Ring-tum -

trol and the Interfraternity

   

be indoctrinated about the
honor system. I also think we
need a redefinement of the
honor code for upper-classmen.
The student body president has
the right to call mandatory at-
tenaance meetings. There the
honor system could be discuss-
ed. You could get down to th®
basic problems of the honor
system. A whole refinement is
what we need.”’

Elaborating on other facets of
the honor code, Gallagher
stated that ‘“‘to be a_ total
gentleman means more than
not lying, cheating, or stealing.
But I think that unless we
specify exactly what we mean,
we'll run into a lot of problems.
The honor code should just in-
clude lying, cheating, and steal-
ing.”

Reflecting on
the’’gentleman’’ ideal
Gallagher said, ‘‘ideally, a
W&L gentleman is supposed to

Council.

“The Student Affairs Com-
mittee has stripped the I.F.C. of
their powers; we need to cor-
rect that,’’ Williams said. He
also said that faculty members
of the SAC and the administra-
tion were trying to increase the
control of the Student Affairs
Committee over Student Con-
trol and “‘that’s not right.”’ As a
member of the University Coun-
cil, Williams said he would
work to ‘‘maintain the strength
of the E.C. and the SCC”’ so that
they could ‘‘perform their func-
tions.”

As a past member of various
campus committees, Williams
feels he ‘‘would be ap-
proachable by a large segment
of the student body.’’ He listed
the student recruitment com-
mittee, the student athletic
committee, tennis player, class
president, and _ two-time
member of the SCC as qualifica-

realized should be made. I don’t
think students understand how
much money someone could
stand to maké,” Tucker added,
‘In that they are financed by
the student body funds, I think
they should be accountable to
what student body interests
want them to write, not what a
corps of four or five writers
want them to write. They should
be sensitive to what the student
body wants and not dictate
policy on their own whims.”

Williams: Yes. ‘‘As far as
salaries are concerned, there is
some justification because of
having to make deadlines.”’ He
says Salaries are an incentive
and “might attract someone
who might not otherwise app-
ly.”” However, he says, ‘‘I have
problems with them being on a
commission basis. The business
manager might sacrifice news
space for” more profits. He sug-
gests having a flat yearly
salary.

Do you favor a cover charge
in the Cockpit?

Bovay: No. “I’m opposed to
cover charges for students in
the Cockpit.’”’ Bovay says
Cockpit is part of the univer-
sithw chih student: pay pay for
and which they have a right to
utilize without it costing them
anything. If a band is of high
calibere, he says a cover charge
could be chairgd, but not for
W&L students and their dates.

Dudley: Yes. “But I don’t
think the Cockpit should be
booked up four nights out of the
week.”’

Gallagher: Yes. I think that if
quality entertainment can be
put in the Cockpit for one night,
and if that entertainment will
cost a little more than the
money the EC has provded,
then I think it’s necessary. Of
course, the students’ pocket-
books have to be kept in mind.

Tucker. No. “I disagree flat
out with cover charges in the
Cockpit for W&L students. For
outsiders, yes. For students and
dates, no.”’

Williams. Yes. “It’s not
unreasonable to pay $1 for a
cover charge’’ for entertain-
ment ‘“‘above and beyond what
the Student Music Union or the
Cockpit can afford.’’ You can
make the argument that
Students have already paid
their student activity fee, but
it’s not too high a price for
quality entertainment,
Williams says.

Are you in favor of graduated
honor violation penalties?

Bovay: No. “I’m opposed to
any form of graduated honor
violation penalties.” Bovay
says it would tend to ‘‘dilute the
system.’’ And he wonders how
he could tell whether lying or
plagiarism is more
dishonorable.

Dudley: No. Dudley is oppos-
ed to graduated penalties for
honor violators. “I am more in
favor of a proposal that gives
equal treatment to all
violators,’’ he said, even if that
means that all honor violators
could reapply at a later date,
although that would not be his
choice. Dudley believes all

penalties to convicted honor
violators should be equal in the
interest of fairness.

Gallagher: No. I think that
once we start to ease off on the
penalties of the honor system,
then what we start to do is to
give room for more honor viola-
tions.

Tucker: Yes, with one provi-
sion: ‘It should be public
knowledge when the guy comes
back to school that he was con-
victed on an honor trial.”’
Tucker says details of the case
would not be public knowledge.
A recording of his conviction
would be put on his transcript.
A convicted honor violator
would have to wait ‘a year,
perhaps two”’ before he could
reapply to W&L. Reapplication
would be the only form of
graduated penalties.

Williams: No. “‘My gut reac-
tion is, can you define what a
serious and not so serious honor
violation is?’’ Although he says
he sees the argument that
you’re dealing with a person’s
reputation and ‘“‘you can screw
a guy for life” he says he leans
against graduated penalties.
However, he says he will be
amenable to whatever the out-
come of the student referendum
on Monday is.

Are you in favor of a third law
representative?

Bovay: No.

Dudley: Yes. Dudley said
that he is now in favor of the law
school having three E.C.
representatives because more
law school involvement on the
E.C. might go a long way
toward mending the differences
between the undergraduates
and the law school.

Gallagher: Yes. I think that
that’s necessary as along the
same reason for having two
freshmen representatives.
Each law school class is very
distinct. Now the third year law
school class is represented by
the second year EC represen-
tative. The law school is in-

creasing in size anyway.
Tucker: Yes.
Williams: Yes. ‘Per-capita-
wise the law school is

theoretically represented” and
the additional member, along
with an extra freshman
representative might make the
committee unmanageable, ‘‘I’d
lean toward increased
representation.”

Do you favor having the votes
of committee members open to
the public?

Bovay: Yes. ‘‘There are very
few cases where they should be
closed. I think the most impor-
tant thing is that we as students
are allowed to have input, that
we are allowed to influence
members of the committee.”’

Dudley: No. Dudley thinks
the vote should take place in
secret, as it is now, but the
results should be announced
publicly.

Gallagher: Yes. I’m for com-
plete open meetings. I feel
students have a right to know
how these different committee
members vote.

Tucker: No. “I’m in agree-

ment with the basic intent of
open meetings format, but I
think there are a couple of times
when the right should be reserv-
ed to withhold that privilege. I
don’t think individual
members’ votes should be
public.”’ Cases in which open
meetings would be harmful to
the committee process, Tucker
says, is when it discusses an in-
ternal conflict involving one of
its members and when it is
searching for a band. ‘‘We lost
‘four or five good groups (this
year) because we couldn’t get
people assembled in time to
make a decision.”

Williams: Yes. ‘‘I’m in favor
of open meetings.” Committees
must be accountable and
responsible to committees.
Things leak out at W&L. I knew
the theme for Fancy Dress was
the ‘Glories of Egypt in
November. You might as well
have it open.”’ Williams says he
doubts open meetings would
mean “a steady influx of
students”’ at the meetings, and
he says there might be certain
circumstances, such as SAB’s
choosing of bands which should
be done in executive session,
however he called the signing of
the Spinners, despite opposition
from a large segment of the stu-
dent body, ‘“‘unconscienable.’’

Williams: Yes. Committee
members ‘‘shouldn’t profit at
the expense of the student
body.’”’ The EC would probably
approve of parties if warranted,
he says.

Should the Law School get 95
percent of its student activity
back from the EC during ap-
propriations?

Bovay: Yes.

Dudley: No. “The E.C.

should give the Student Bar
Association a lump sum to ap-
propriate,’ as is now done,
Dudley said. Approximately 80
percent of law student funds
should be returned from the stu-
dent activity fund, which
Dudley believes would be more
realistic than the suggested 95
percent.

Gallagher: No. I think the law
school get about what they’re
receiving now — 85%.

Tucker: No. “I think that
percentage is too high. They
should get a majority of it
back.” It should be about 75-80
percent.

Williams: No. They should
probably get back ‘‘more than
80 percent but not neccessarily
95 percent.’’ He says law school
students ‘‘don’t want to screw
around with a lot of the things
you have in the undergrad.”’
However, he says it must be
remembered that this is a
university. By giving the law
school 95 percent, ‘‘In a sense
you'd be saying ‘fine’, go ahead
and become your own entity.”
He says he’d like to see the ra-
tionale behind it and more
specificity.

Do you favor coeducation?

Bovay: Should be the issue be
brought up before the Board of
Trustees, and I think it should, I
would try to articulate to the
Board of Trustees the feelsings
of the students here. Right now
I perceive those feelings to be
split 50-50. Personally I would
prefer to represent student opi-
nion.

they’ve gone through, and I
really don’t think it is that
healthy an atmosphere.

Tucker: ‘‘If it would increase
academic standards, yes. But
I’'d have to be convinced of
that.”

Williams: ‘‘Unless it’s a mat-
ter of admissions and stan-
dards, it’s not something I’d
like to see right away.”
Coeducation is ‘‘a viable alter-
native with slipping admis-
sions. I understand UVa in-
creased standards somewhat”
when it went coed. The ad-
ministration can’t be iron-
willed, Williams says. ‘Some
things do change.”

Are you in favor of having
honor advocates to represent
honor defendants?

Bovay: No. ‘‘Honor trials are
more effective when the accus-
ed speaks for himself.”

Dudley: Yes. ‘Counsel
should be allowed to cross-
examine witnesses, but not to
make the closing statement for
the defendant,’’ Dudley said. In
addition, the accused should
make his own answer to in-
quiries instead of relying heavi-
ly on his counsel for advice.

Gallagher: Yes. Both sides
could be represented fairly. An
accused person is going thorugh
a very traumatic experience.
An advisor would be more level-
headed and in arguing the case
could provide more persuasive
arguments for its case. I think
this is the only fair thing to do.

Tucker: Yes.

Williams: Yes. ‘When you’ve
got something that serious’
they’re good to have.

Should the Contact appoint-
ment procedures in which the
former co-chairmen have a vote
be changed to reduce their
power?

Bovay: Yes. ‘“‘You’ve got to
include more IFC people or EC
people, but you’ve got to have
those people on the selection
commit committee for their in-
put. Somehow you’ve got to
reduce their influence.”

Dudley: No. ‘Contact can
solicit money from whomever
they want,” Dudley said, ‘‘but
they should account for the
money to the Executive Com-
mittee and the Interfraternity
Council.”

Gallagher: Yes. I think there
should be 3 EC, 3 IFC represen-
tatives picking the contact
cot Co-chairmen and _ that’s
all.

Tucker: Yes. ‘That wov'u
an excellent idea.”’ Tucker sug-
gests that chairmen should be
chosen a week before anyone
else on the committee. ‘‘That
would give them time to solicit
workers who didn’t want to get
involved in_ politics
beforehand.”’

Williams: No. “I can’t see
taking away (co-chiarmens’)
voting power. They know more
about the qualifications and
capabilities of people on the
committee than anyone else.”

In your
Pit —

by Galen Trussell

Last week’s entertainment in
the Pit featured a four-day line-
up. Wednesday featured one of
the classics of science fiction
literature in a film which has
become one of the classics of
science fiction film. I refer to
H.G. Wells’ The War of the
Worlds.

Thinking aside now, I plan to
make a million with a UFO-
disco-Rocky flick, All I have to
do is have the aliens land
(behind a disco) and challenge
John Revolta to a_ disco
showdown at midnight. Revolta
would deal out the hustle for the
full two album sides of the Gee
Bees sound-track, before the
decision went to the aliens.

What? Have the aliens win?
Some might consider that as
blasphemous as pitting James
T. Kirk against a smart KI-
ingon. Don’t worry friends. I
won’t rip off you’re happy en-
ding. Before the aliens leave
they start teaching humans how
to dance. However, before the
humans can learn the in-
terplanetary hustle they must
discover the FUNK. Once
humans let the funk rule them
they are at ease. Man abando.

Beer Drinking Contest in Cockpit

The Washington Post and The
Richmond Times-Dispatch
have recently pointed out hat
the students of W&L are
primarily a grain-imbibing
species. But next Friday, on
Mar 17, in the Cockpit, The St.
Patrick’s Day Beer Drinking
Contest’ will be held for all
those willing to prove other-
wise.

The rules will be simple: sign
up on the entry blank in the
Cockpit some time before
Thursday, March 16, and then
show up for the first round on
Friday night at 9. Unfortunately
the maximum number of par-
ticipants will be 75, so sign up
before you lose out.

Students will be placed in
groups of five, and those fine

will ‘‘drink it out” to see who is

Lritaripart atte Pris PPE

add slips. The final scene pic-
tures the aliens departing
assured in t. heir knowledge
that the money they invested in
polyester will double in two
light years.

Coming down to the Pit (not
to say it is a bring-down), last
Thursday night featured Burr
Datz and his traveling minstrel
friend Chris Rohrs. Rohrs who
by all reports is excellent, is go-
ing to be in the area for a while.
The Thursday performance was
also reported to be very good
and very well attended.

Over the weekend Marti Bear
returned to the Cockpit. Marti is
a real performer, very profes-
sional, knowing how to act with
his crowd. His music was
primarily well known material,
not very much original material
at all. Marti must have been‘
amused (as all who were pre-
sent) by the antics of a VMI
paratrooper who was impress-
ing the crowd with his chugging
prowess, The old tune, ‘‘What
Do You Do with a Drunken
Sailor?’? must have _ been
floating in a few minds that
night.

This week is, as of yet, very
much up in the air. Disco Dan is
planning something for yester-
day, after having infered at the
EC meeting that the UCC
wasn’t fulfilling its obligation to
do so. The UCC has, however,
planned to present the Buffalo

-Chips tomorrow night. Tonight

the movie Hustle will be shown.

Glee Club Holds Concert;
Shillington Wins Raffle!

by Robert Tremblay

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club gave a concert at Lee
Chapel Tuesday night, a con-
cert no doubt serving as a tune-
up for the troupe’s concert tour
in Mexico. If this is the case, the
Mexicans are in for a fabulous
show.

The Glee Club combined on
their, program some _ songs
heard on the Parent’s Day Con-
cert with some new numbers.
Grieg’s ‘‘Brothers, Sing On!”’
and the spirituals ‘‘Ain’a That
Good News!,’”’ “Mary Had A
Baby,” and “Ev’ry Time I Feel
the Spirit” were from the
previous concert and, due to a
“‘little’’ more practice and time,
came across more polished
than before.

Vittoria’s “Jesu Dulcis” and
‘“‘Ave Maria’ were sung quite
well with the polyphony smooth

A little drama in cooperation

Britten was one of the great

ty and feeling, and the piano ac-
companiment (Jay Taggart)
was sweeping. This piece in-
deed makes full use of the width
of the keyboard.

“The Drummer and the
Cook’”’ was next and was
thoroughly charming. It includ-
ed some fine solo singing
(Claude Colonna, baritone),
some ‘“‘bow-wow’s,”’ some wed-
ding music, and even that
famous Handelian pause before
the final cadence that is so
familiar in ‘‘Messiah ‘‘

I din’t think the Glee Club
could top that song for enter-
tainment, but they did with
their final effort. “Johnny
Schmoker.”’ What a great song
and act! This number definitely
belongs in Music 151 as instruc-
tion. What better way to learn
the trombone’s and the
bagpipe’s tone colors than
through this visual and aural
showcase. Bright orange gloves
are, of course, a prerequisite.

Professor Spice has once
again rehearsed the Glee Club
marvelously and the singing
from the tenors, to the
baritones, to the basses was
balanced and satisfying. I only
wish more W&L students could
have been there to appreciate
this fine performance.

By the way, the winner of the
trip to Mexico with the Glee
Club was none other than Pro-
fessor Shillington, second prize,
a $25 certificate at the W&L
Record Store, went to George
Johnson.

MUSICAL. MAINSTREAM

by Mark Mainwaring Associate

After months of speculation,
the rumors concerning a possi-
ble Genesis tour are fact. The
band recently announced plans
for its 1978 World Tour, which
will open with a short tour of the
United States beginning March
29. The second stage will take
them to Europe, where they will
carry a 20-day itinerary in May.
Returning to North America in

dates, including such venues as
Montreal’s Olympic Stadium
and New York’s Madison
Square Garden. Mid-August
will find them back in Europe
for ten festival appearances;
and in the fall, Genesis will be
back in America for 25 more
arena shows. The full schedule
will conclude in November with
the group’s debut tour of Japan.

tually been around for quite
some time. Their first album,
From Genesis to Revelation,
was released in 1968 by the
band’s still-teenaged founding
members: Tony Banks, An-
thony Phillips, Michael Ruther-
ford, and incredible vocalist-
visual frontman Peter Gabriel.
This was followed by a string of
albums in the early ‘70's,
climaxing in the near-classic
Genesis Live, the band’s first
live album. They were still
nearly unknown in this country,
however, until the release of
Selling England by the Pound
in 1973. The Lamb Lies Down on
Broadway, a double-LP concept
album released one year later,
finally gained Genesis the na-
tional recognition that it had
been seeking.

The controversial departure
of lead vocalist and (many
think) principal Genesis
musical force Peter Gabriel in
1975 was seen by some
observers as the death knell for
the group, but instead, Genesis
has grown ever more popular,
particularly with the release of
their latest album (and second
live LP), Seconds Out.

The permanent line-up of
Genesis now consists of: Tony
Banks, keyboards; Phil Collins,
drum and vocals; and Mike
Rutherford, guitars and basses.
Due for release to coincide with
the opening of the tour is
Genesis’ sixth Atlantic album,
appropriately entitled And
Then There Were Three...

The dates so far con-
firmed for the first leg of the
1978 World Tour are as follows:
Mar. 29, Buffalo, N.Y.; Mar. 30,
Rochester, N.Y.; Mar. 31,
Philadelphia, Pa.; April 1, Suf-
fern, N.Y.; Apr. 2, University

ington, Ill; Apr. 10, St. Louis ,

Apr. 15, SanDiego, Calif.; and
Apr. 17, LosAngeles, Calif.
Other tour dates will follow as
soon as they are announced.
Future columns will also in-
clude summer concert informa-
tion for other a. groups (the

RING-TUM PHI

Regional Title
Eludes Cagers

by Mark Mitchell

The most successful basket-
ball season in the history of
Washington and Lee University
ended Sunday night with a 81-64
loss to Kean College in the finals
of the South Atlantic Regionals.

The Generals, a team that
had never won an NCAA playoff
game, defeated 13th ranked
Jersey City in the first round of
the tournament, 66-65, on Satur-
day.

Considering the importance
of the game, it was probably the
best win for the team all season.
TheGenerals scored the first
basket of the game but then
trailed Jersey City until 4:20
was left in the game. At that
point, Pat Dennis, the tourna-
ment MVP, scored his 28th and
29th points to give the Generals
a 62-61 lead. Moments later,
W&L led 64-61.

But Jersey City countered
quickly, acoring four straight
points to lead by one at 65-64
with 2:33 remaining.

The Generals then tried to
hold on to the ball, and get a
very high percentage shot.
However, Jersey City stole the
ball, and with only 23 seconds
left, the Generals fouled Wyatt,
a man who had scored 29 points
in the game.

Fortunately, Wyatt missed
the first shot of the one and one
and the Generals rebounded.
The Generals moved the ball
quickly down court and with on-
ly 2 seconds remaining, Mike
Wenke found Larry Meyer
underneath. Meyer made the
layup giving the Generals their
first ever NCAA playoff victory,
66-65.

The next night, against Kean
College, a team the Generals
started out very well.
Washington and Lee led 134
and then 17-10, but by half-time
found themselves down 36-32.

The Generals started the se-

cond half impressivley, knot-
ting the score at 38 all, with 18
minutes to play.

But it was to be their last

gasp. In the next 11 minutes, thé’ —

Generals were outscored 26-8 by
Kean. Many of these points
were due to Kean’s press which
forced the Generals to commit
31 turnovers. The press and the
advantage of playing on their
home court were very much in
evidence as Kean rolled off 12
unanswered points early in the
second half.

Kean’s defense prevented the
Generals from getting the
balanced scoring they were ac-
customed to. Only one man
scored in double figures for the
Generals, Pat Dennis’ who had
30. Meyers, who had 17 against
Jersey City, was effectively
denied the ball in the post,
resulting in him scoring below
his average.

Thus, very abruptly another
basketball season is over.
However, it was not just
another season. The Generals,
in a rebuilding year, won 22 of
28 games, including their first
ever NCAA tournament game.

Pat Dennis scored more
points in a single season than
any General had in anyone of
the 71 previous seasons.

While Dennis was scoring 700
points, Wenke was breaking the
old school assist record (which
he held).

At the same time, Meyer was
averaging 56 percent from the
field, was in the top 5 in the
ODAC in rebounding and scor-
ing (in additon to setting the
most vicious screens in the
ODAC) and yet was snubbed, as
was assist leaderWenke, in the
voting for the all-ODAC team.

Thus, a team that won 11 of 12
ODAC contests, placed only one
player on the ODAC first team
all-star team (MVP Pat Den-
nis) and only one player on the
second team (Dave Leunig).

Grapplers Come Up
Short In NCAA’s

The W&L wrestlers com-
pleted the 1977-78 season last
weekend by sending four in-
dividuals to the NCAA Division
III national championships in
Wheaton, Illinois. Only senior
tri-captain Howard Knipp was
_ able to win a match in Wheaton,
defeating his Baldwin-Walace
opponent 7-3 at 126.

Knipp lost his next match
10-8. Also competing for the
Generals were junior tri-
captain Ed Rodgers, losing 9-2.
to Geneseo State’s Greg Net-
tleton at 150. Junior tri-captain
Dan Kniffen lost 12-8 at 177,

while sophmore Ray Gross lost
5-0 at 142.

W&L had earlier concluded
their dual match season at 9-8
and won the championship of
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference. Rodgers, the ODAC’s
Wrestler of the Year finished at
24-9, one win shy of the W&L
single season record set last
season by Jim Crytzer. He led
the team in all individual
categories except escapes over
the course of the season.

Gross concluded his year at
22-9-2, second best on the team.

Duke Stuns Generals

For only the second time in
the past ten seasons, a
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team dropped their season
opener. The Generals were
defeated by the Duke Universi-
ty Blue Devils in Durham, N. C.
12-10 on Monday. It was Duke’s
first win over the W&L since
1968-69, and only the second
time in the past. 10 seasons that
W&L has dropped their season
opener.

The Duke win avenged an 18-5
W&L win last spring on W&L’s
Wilson Field. It was disappoin-
ting considering last year’s
Generals 11-4 finish and fifth na-
tional ranking in the University

Division. The opening loss
makes it an up hill battle from
here on in. However, we should
remember the last time a W&L
team lost their first game was
in 1975, losing 8-7 to Morgan
State. That year the team
finished 11-7 and ranked fifth
nationally.

W&L trailed early 3-0 before

exploding for six straight goals,

including two each by junior
Johnny Black and senior co-
captain Jay Sindler to take a 6-3
lead with 8:08 remaining in the
first half.

Led by Ithaca, N. Y. transfer
Tony Cullen, Duke came storm-
ing back. The Blue Devils tied

Swimuners Take ;

Third in State

The Washington and Lee
swim team had what coach Bill
Stearns called their ‘‘best show-
ing ever’’ in the Virginia State
Meet held at James .Madison
University in Harrisonburg
three weekends ago. The
Generals finished in third
place with 308 points behind
champion Richmond 414 and
runner-up Virginia Tech 384.
After W&L came VCU, William
and Mary, JMU, VMI, Hampton
Institute and ODU.

The highlight of the weekend
for W&L were three state
records. Junior transfer David
Kent set two new Virginia
records, winning the 100 back in
54.175 and the 200 back in
1:59.597. The W&L 800 free
relay team of Kent, Bob
Newcomb, Keith Romich and
John Hudson set a new state
mark of 7:04.149.

W&L was in fourth after the
first day of swimming. John
Hudson won the 500 free in
4:45.702. while Kent was sixth at
4:47.319. The Generals passed
Virginia Commonwealth on Fri-

day and held third place the

rent of the way. In addition to
Kent’s victory in the 100 back
and the 800 free relay win, Hud-
son also won the 200 free on Fri-
day in 1:45.045. Drew Pillsbury
was also sixth in the 100 back
with a 56.804 clocking

In final day action, Hudson
was second in the 1650 free at
16:53.350 and Hoke was third at
16:45.269. Romich and

Newcomb finished fifth and
sixth in the 100 free at 49.106 and
49.163. Kent topped all swim-
mers in the 200 back and
Pillsbury was third at 2:01.874.
Romich completed W&L’s suc-
cess by finishing fifth in the 200
butterfly at 2:02.600.

Seven W&L swimmers have
qualified for theDivision III na-
tional championships set for
March, 11-18 in Grinell, Iowa.
Senior standout John Hudson
qualified in the 200,500 and 1650
free events. Co-captain Romich
qualified in the 100 and 200 free
and the 200 fly. Other W&L
qualifiers were Drew Pillsbury
in the 100 and 200 back and 400
IM, Chip Hoke in the 500 and
1650 free and the 400 IM, Bob
Newcomb in the 100 and 200
free, and Jay Diesing in the one
meter diving.

The 400 free relay team of
Newcomb, Scott Duff, Romich
and Hudson and the 800 free
relay team of Newcomb, Hoke,
Romich and Hudson will also
compete. Last year the
Generals had five All-
Americans and finished ninth
nationally as a team. The first
twelve finishers in each event
are named All-American.

Due to his transfer status,
David Kent is not eligible to
compete inthe nationals but
will swim in this weekend’s
Eastern Seaboard Champion-
ships at Brown University. Kent
will compete in the 100 and 200
free and the 100 and 200 back.

the score at 7-7 at the half and
scored the first three goals of
the second half to take a 10-7
lead with 2:38 left in the third
period. The generals closed the
gape to 10-9 with 11:34 to play,
and were expected to do what so
many previous W&L teams
have done, and that’s win the
close game: But it wasn’t to be
as Duke scored two more times
and W&L once making the final
12-10.

The Generals were led in
scoring by junior honorable
mention All-American at-
tackman Jeff Fritz and senior
middle Jay Sindler each with
three goals and an assist. Black
had two goals and an assist.
Cullen completed ‘the afternoon
for Duke with five goals and two
assists for seven points.

Charlie Brown went the
distance in goal for W&L sur-
rendering 12 goals and making
17 saves. Each team had an ex-
tra man goal and Duke won the
faceoffs 16-10. Duke outshot the
Generals 41-34 but W&L took
the ground ball lead at 75-64
although Duke came up with
some key ground balls late in
the game.

The lack of outside playing
time in the pre-season due to re-
cent bad weather had an ob-
vious effect on the young and in-
experienced Generals. The
team knows that they have their
work ahead of them having lost
their top five defensemen and
the top scorer from 1977.

According to head coach Jack
Emmer, he anticipated a close
game with Duke. He summed
up the reason for Duck’s
triumph as being, ‘Duke is a
very much improved team, and
we are inexperienced.’ He add-
ed that Duke got a ‘‘couple of
breaks with deflected shots that
we didn’t.” Not wanting to ap-
pearing to be making an ex-
cuse, he explained that those
were the type of breaks that any
team expects to get to win a
close game.

Emmer felt that there was no
need to panic after the team’s
first loss. He said, ‘‘We learned
that we must hang together. We
will develop and improved as
the season goes on.”’

With U.N.C., U.Va., Rutgers,
and Hofstra on the schedule the
Generals still have their destiny
in their own hands. These are
the teams that W&L is
realistically competing with for
the playoffs. If the Generals can
register victories over these
teams, they can expect a
playoff bid for the eight team
tournament in the end of Mav.

The first home game is March
20 against Ohio State, a team
that Emmer cautiously says
“‘we know very little about.”’

Emmer concluded by saying,
“‘We’re going to need good stu-
dent support at the home games
this year.’’ He doublted that the
season opening defeat would
put a damper on the enthusiasm
the W&L community has shown
in past years for the lacrosse
team. =

Before the team entertains
Ohio State, they will travel to
Baltimore this Saturday to play
the Mt. Washington Lacrosse
Club, the 1977 club champions.
students from academics?

Is this what professors mean by Fancy Dress distracting

of their vacation time. He added
that if students see Fancy Dress
as a vacation, why not’ have it
during a vacation.

Sessions was emphatic about
his belief that Fancy Dress
could thrive at another time,
while not interfering with
academic work. Beckley said
he believed Fancy Dress causes
muchhavoc as far as academic
activities go.

Both professors said they
talked to several colleges
before submitting the proposal.
Beckley said he saw a general
feeling among faculty and
students that Fancy Dress was
creating an academic problem.
Sessions said he talked to some
students who, after the problem
was explained, saw the need to
move the ball.

As originally stated, the pro-
posal would reschedule Fancy
Dress in order to:

*re-establish a revered tradi-
tion,

*allow students and others to
fully prepare for, and to enjoy
the variety of activities collec-
tively denominated ‘Fancy
Dress Weekend,” without the
distractions of classes and
classwork,

*allow students and others
fully to prepare for and to enjoy
the variety of activities collec-
tively denominated “School,”
without the distractions of
classes and classwork,

*permit Fancy Dress events
to occur on or near their natural
date, viz., Valentine’s Day,

*boost the local economy
while reducing student travel
expenditures, by inducing more
people to remain in Lexington
during at least part of the
winter break, and

*nurse back to health that
casualty of overemphasis on
social life — an atmosphere of
intellectual excellence.

According to Sacco if the pro-
posal were passed by the
University Council, it would go
to the faculty, as a whole, for
vote. However, according to
Beckley, the University Council
has the. power to determine
regulations for student ac-

tivities. Beckley’s interpreta-
tion would mean that the pro-
posal would only have to pass a
vote by the University Council
to becoming binding.

Both Sacco and Beckley said
the proposal maV not come toa
vote before the University
Council. Beckley said if other
alternatives, more attractive
than the present proposal, come
out during the UC meeting, one
of the alternatives might be
voted on. Sacco said he doesn’t

_ know of any concrete method of

solving the problem, and that
the UC will be looking at alter-
natives to the proposal which
would schedule Fancy Dress
during the holiday.

Sessions said it was too early
to tell how he would cast his
ballot if the matter did come to
a vote at the next UC meeting.
Beckley said his vote would de-
pend on student reaction to the
proposal. Sacco said, as of now,
he would vote not to schedule
the ball during break.

Sacco said he wouldn’t
assume there is much chance of
the proposal being adopted, but
he could not tell what might
happen or be suggested at the
next meeting.

interest in having the use of a
facility we pay for ought to
prevail over some notion of
charity to local high schools,”
he said. “But,’’ he cautioned,
“I’m not talking about varsity
teams that have to practice in-
side’’ due to inclement weather.
Dudley’s focus is on the “‘out-
side local groups’’ that use the
gym, making it difficult for
W&L students to also use the
facilities.

Regarding the Student Bar
Association’s proposed honor
code revisions, Dudley is not
supportive of all the suggested
changes. In particular, he
believes the E.C. should have no
discression to allow honor
violators to reapply. “I am
more in favor of a proposal that
gives equal treatment to all,”’
he said, instead of the proposed
option which would allow the
E.C. to decide that-a convicted
honor offender could reapply. .

Concerning the honor
system’s jurisdiction, Dudley
believes that ‘“‘a W&L student is
always a W&L student, no mat-
ter where he acts.”’ In his opi-
nion, the honor code should

recognize no physical boun-
daries.

_During an honor trial, Dudley
recommended that certain
changes be made in regard to
the relationship between the ac-
cused and his’ counsel.
Specifically, he said that the
counsel of the accused should be
allowed to directly ask ques-
tions of witnesses, but the
counsel should not make the
defense’s closing statement. He
also recommended that the ac-
cused himself answer inquiries
directly, if possible, rather than
receiving constant advice from
counsel.

Dudley agreed that entering
first year law students need bet-
ter and more thorough honor

code orientation. ‘“‘People pass
judgement on the honor system
in the law school because of in-
adequate orientation,’, the
W&L graduate said.

“I’m going to fight like hell to
keep independent exams,”’
Dudley promised. He said that
as president, he would do
everything in his power to keep
the independent examination
system “‘until there is substan-
tial evidence of plain and ob-
vious abuses.’’ Dudley con-
siders the exam system, which
is heavily reliant on a strong
honor code, as a privilege. “If
the facts show that we have
abused the privilege, then
maybe we can’t live with
them,” he said.

The law school candidate op-
poses a separate honor system

for the law school. In addition,
he pladged to improve relations
between the undergraduates
and the law students. However,
he conceded that ‘‘it may be im-
possible to improve relations
because of the geographic loca-
tion’’ of the two branches of the
University. ‘I think with the
overwhelming number of issues
before the E.C., the two groups’
interests are closely related.

To allay the fears some
undergraduates might have at
the prospect of a law school
E.C. president, Dudley em-
phasized the fact that he attend-
ed W&L as a student. “I am not
the law school candidate com-
ing across the bridge to ram the
law school’s ideas down the
throats of the undergraduates,”’
he said.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

VOTE!

For one of the first elections in recent years students have a real
choice when they go to the polls Monday to vote for the “Big Three”’
Executive Committee officers.

In particular, the three candidates running for the presidency of
the student body offer views that represent all points on the campus
political spectrum.

Go out and vote. It is the only way you can express your view on
how you want student government to be run. Seniors: you can vote,
too; you should vote, too. You might not be here next year, but you
still owe it to the school to express your retrospective view of stu-
dent government at W&L.

Don’t try to shrug this campaign off as issueless. A great deal of
issues have arisen, some of which could mean far-reaching
changes. If issues are all you’re interested in, then at the very least
vote on the two referendum questions and one opinion poll question.
The referenda require for passage that at least half the student
body vote and two-thirds of those voting cast their ballot in favor of
the measures. W&L has not had a 50 percent voter turnout in years.
It’s about time the students were heard on the referendum ques-
tions: whether two freshmen representatives and three law school
representatives should be on the EC. And that means it’s about
time students showed up at the polls.

In order to give the voters a basis on which a critical judgement
of each candidate can be made, the Ring-tum Phi has changed its
format of election coverage. In the past, the’’coverage”’ consisted
of accepting PR releases from the candidates. That meant can-
didates could ignore the issues (if, indeed, the Ring-tum Phi had
presented any issues throughout the course of the year) or couch
them in vague, flowery campaign literature.

The coverage of the presidential election, for obvious reasons,
has put the Ring-tum Phi in a curious position. However, the staff
has been given its complete independence. Your attention is
directed to the staff box below.

In order to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest,
however, the Ring-tum Phi will not comment on the presidential
race. But this does not prevent us from taking an interest in another
“Big Three” election. The battle for secretary of the EC could be
very interesting. While Andy Bodenstab was the only candidate to
file a petition for the post, Tom McCarthy and William Paxton have
announced write-in campaigns.

It is encouraging to see that students such as Mr. Paxton do not
like to see offices left uncontested and want to contribute to the stu-
dent government process. But we must seriously question Mr. Pax-
ton’s experience. He has been totally uninvolved instudent govern-
ment to date.

Mr. Bodenstab, who served on the EC this year, can point to a
year’s experience on the EC. If you consider just showing up at
meetings to be helpful ‘‘experience.’’ While serving on the EC, he
has been one of its most inactive, inconspicuous and inconsistent
measures.

The only logical choice for EC secretary is Tom McCarthy. Mr.
McCarthy has served with distinction as SAB secretary this year.
He has never missed a meeting and has painstakingly carried out
the duties of SAB secretary where such duties in the past were per-
formed haphazardly, at best. Without knowing or having to know
McCarthy’s stand on the issues, the Ring-tum Phi unequivocably
supports him. His candidacy should be welcomed and supported by
anyone who is concerned with having qualified and diligent
students leading the EC.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry
Pub board answers

Dear Editor:

I have never felt compelled to
get the last word in on a con-
troversial issue, especially
when the position I support has
already been capably defended
by others. In spite of the elo-
quence of Lee Howard and Amy
Herring, however, I feel that
some sort of statement from the
Publication Board is called for
as a complement to their efforts
and as a response to the
“righteous indignation” (if I
may borrow from your refined
vocabulary, Mr. Healy) of the
EC.

The letter to the editor co-
authored by Jim Underhill and
Tom Healy was disappointing in
its poorly disguised theme of
frustration. They have every
right to use words such as ‘‘ad-
mittedly,” “‘regrettably,” and
‘unfortunately’ to introduce
sentences which explain their
recent action (or inaction). I
commend the EC for being able
to admit its mistakes, but I de-
fend the Publications Board’s
irritation of the letter is a lesson
in paradox: ‘Considering the

Ring-tum Phi’s zealous concern_

for the rights of students, the
front page identification of a
student convicted of an honor
offense is inexplicable.’’ Inex-
plicable? Why, it makes all the
sense ‘in the world. It is the
students’ right to know when
the Honor System has been
reduced to a bad joke, when a
convicted offender peddles his
wares on campus, and when the
EC twiddles its thumbs and
looks the other way.

In another part of the letter,
Healy and Underhill refer to the
Publications Board’s respon-
ding ‘with the predictable
litany of prior censorship and
first amendment priorities.”
Assuming that at least half of
this letter was written by a law
student, and noting the evident
disdain for the principles on
which this “‘predictable litany”
is based, I find such a statement
alarming. It is ironic that while

. the Publications Board was at-
=

eaateaaere

zeeaactetrveretave

tacked for having a (shudder)
somewhat flexible policy, the
EC, and its White Book, with all
its sections and articles, could
not cope with the problem of
dismissing a recalcitrant of-
fender from campus.

The Ring-tum Phi has
recognized its obligation to the
Honor System not by shutting
up but by speaking out. There
are times when the machinery
of justice needs adjusting; the
Publications Board views tbe
actions of the Ring-tum Phi not
as a wrench thrown between the
gears, but rather as a well-

administered whack at the right —

moment.
Sincerely,
Ryland Owen
Pres., Pub. Board

Handbook
mistakes

Ken Mastrilli

Glaring mistakes in the 1977
Student Handbook have surfac-
ed in the Ring-tum Phi’s in-
vestigation of various non-
existent and _ leaderless
organizations like the Indepen-
dent Union and the Student Cur-
riculum Committee.

Hopefully SAB chairman Bill
Tucker will heed our findings by
thoroughly editing and updating
next year’s Student Handbook.

Also, faculty members
responsible for portions of the
student catalogue might give
more than just a cursory glance
to their their particular respon-
sibilities so that incoming
freshmen will not be led astray
by “misinformation”.

The Phi’s investigation did
not cover various organizations
like the outing club, the brass
ensemble, the Sazeracs and the
chess and croquet club, seeing
no need to belabor the point that
there are many organizations
whose worthiness of being in-
cluded in student publications is
questionable.

Healy
clarifies

DearEditor:

The recent Herr-
ing/Gallagher attack on my
concern for students’ rights was
misguided. I favor strengthen-
ing procedural safeguards that
protect an accused student
from unfairness. At least ten
days ago the chairman of the
student Control Committee
received a letter from me urg-
ing that the following rights be
incorporated into the SCC state-
ment on Procedures and
Policy:

A student shall have the
right—

1) not to say anything that

» might incriminate him,

1) to have adequate time to.
prepare his defense, and

3) to be accompanied by an ad-
visor during the Student Control
hearing.

The SCC voted to include
these rights, as well as my sug-
gestion that a student be in-
formed of these rights before
being questioned by a Student
Control Investigator.

Ms. Herring would not know
about any of this, of course,
because rather than talk with
me about it, she consulted only
one source before writing her
letter. Next time Amy, let’s
talk. We sit only four carrels
apart.

Honor Code changes

proposed by SBA:

The Student Bar Association
has proposed that several
changes be made in the Honor
System.

1. The single sanction: This
would be retained, with the
modification that the EC or stu-
dent jury may permit the con-
victed student to apply for read-

mission after a time determin- .

ed by the appropriate
aforementioned body.

2. Investigation of offenses:
The present system calls for 3
members of the EC to in-
vestigate a possible offense.
These members may then sit in
judgment. Under our proposal,
2 EC members, chosen on a
rotating basis, and 1 student
chosen at random from the
same school as the alleged
honor violator would make the
initial screening investigation.
The two EC members would
then be disqualified from hear-
ing the case, in the event that
the EC chose this line of action.

3. The jurisdiction of the
Honor System: As currently
written, the White Book ap-
pears to give the EC wide
geographical jurisdiction. Our
_ proposal would limit the EC’s

jurisdiction to Lexington,
Rockbridge County, or
wherever a student represents
himself as being enrolled at
Washington and Lee.

4. The advisor’s role in the EC
hearing and at public trial: The
accused’s advisors should be
allowed to question witnesses
before the private hearing, dur-
ing the private hearing, and at
the public trial. Further, the ad-
visor should be allowed to pre-
sent any evidence for the accus-
ed. The accused will still be re-
quired to make his own closing
statements.

5. Permanent notation on the
student’s record: At present, a
student convicted by a public
trial has a notation placed on
his permanent record to that ef-
fect. This penalizes him for ap-
pealing his conviction. Thus, we
urge that no notation be made
on a student’s record that the
student left the University as a
result of an Honor violation.

6. A better focus on what con-
stitutes an honor offense: The
SAB feels that ‘“ungentlemanly
conduct” is too vague and

 

CEPASTAT MOUTHWASH

HUDSON’S VIODAY PLUS IRON

(a one-a-day vitamin
for the rundown student)

openended a standard. Rather,
we propose that the system
focus onlying, stealing, or
cheating.

The Student Bar association
board of.Governers issued this
explanation of their proposed
honor system changes:

“The SBA has sent a list of
proposed changes in the Honor
System to the EC. We have
spent several weeks examining
the System, investigating stu-
dent complaints and soliciting
student comments. The pro-
posals submitted reflect our
response to what we found.

It should be noted that we
made a specific decision that it
would be best for all concerned
if there was one Honor System
for all students of the Universi-
ty. We see ourselves as part of
tbe University with an interest
in strengthening those areas
that we feel need it.

We feel that a change in the
penalty for commission of an
honor offense is in order. Adop-
tion of our recommendation will
strengthen the Honor System by
adding a degree of flexibility
that has not existed and by
making the system appear less
draconian.

As the system now operates,
expulsion is the only penalty for
an honor offense. With this in
mind, many students viewing or
knowing of an honor violation
hesitate to inform theEC. While
they know that a wrong has
been committed, they fee that
the penalty is too harsh. Hence,
they act as judge and jury and
keep silent. Further, the EC
has, in effect, used a form of
flexible penalties. Certain of-
fenders who were in fact guilty
of offenses were not convicted
due to the insignificance of their
offense when compared with
the extreme penalty. This selec-
tive application of the expusion
sanotion seems to deny certain
offenders of equal protection
under the system, and has the
general effects of weakening
the student respect for the
White Book.

Thus, an adoption of our pro-
posal would merely codify the
realities of the situation, and
would lead to a rehabilitation of
the system, both in its degree of
sophistication and in the eyes of
the students, who in the last
analysis must operate under it
andenforce it.

rather than thinking all expen-
ditures out. He suggests a finan-
cial report be due at the end of
every year detailing every ex-
penditure so that next year’s
committee could decide
whether some of the money
might have been wasted.

On the issue of oversight of
committees, Tucker said the ad
hoc system is a good system,
“but it’s not followed up
enough. It seems like the only
time the SAB was ever brought
out was when something was
printed in the Phi. The press
should get on government when
government hasn’t exercised its
duties, but I don’t think the

 

(for prompt relief of minor

government should wait for the
press to lead the way.”

Tucker says too much of an
issue has been made of Student
Control’s allegedly overlooking

student rights. He said only one
case brought before the com-
mittee was even marginal on
that issue, but adds he agrees a
list of student rights should be
made explicit.

Tucker said he is in favor of
“‘a little special priority’ for
minority student applicants,
but W&L “should not ignore
standards. I am not a reverse
discriminst,’’ he said. However,
“If a white Caucasian has the
same board scores as a minori-
ty, go with the minority.”

Asked his opinion on declining
applications, Tucker said he
doesn’t think it is a big problem.
He says he has seen a report
which indicates applications
are down from the top level and
the bottom level of applicants.
Since W&L draws largely from
the middle level of applicant,
according to Tucker, admission

SAB chairman seeks V-P

standards should not be a pro-
blem.

Tucker called the Ring-tum
Phi’s decision to print the name
of an honor defendant ‘‘inex-
cusable.’’ He said printing an
article of that nature is con-
trary to the honor system.
Tucker said the article could
have been printed if the identity
of the person was not made
known.

On the subject of relations
with the law school, Tucker
said, ‘Communication will
solve 9) percent of the pro-
blem.”’ If undergraduates were
aware that the law school pro-
posals are in the best inte est of
everyone and is not done for
their own self interest, some of
the’ problems could be cor-
rected, he said. Communication
must be on all levels, not just in
the top echelons, Tucker em-

hasized.

 

Williams: Hoping to be VP

(continued from page 2)

tions.

Regarding student subcom-
mittees, Williams said that the
E.C. should maintain its right to
make committees accountable
to them, but should not become
‘‘a police force.’’ Appointments

_ are the key. “‘We’ve got to ap-

point people who wé can trust,”
he said.

‘Whenever a cop walks into a
party where there are 50 people
who have been drinking and
there’s a band playing and he
tells them to stop, there’s bound
to be an ugly situation,” the
vice-presidential hopeful said.
He characterized present stu-
dent police relations as ‘‘good,”’
but was bothered by the ‘‘sud-
den’? enforcement of Lex-
ington’s noise ordinance.
Williams feels the I.F.C. and
the police need to work together
more closely to avoid confronta-
tions.

The current animosity bet-
ween W&L’s law students and
undergraduates is a ‘‘sad situa-
tion’’ to Williams. ‘‘This is sup-
posed to be a University,”’ he
said. However, he noted that
“their interest in the E.C.
demonstrates to me a_ will-
ingness on their part to work
within the system to effect bet-
ter relations’? between the two
schools.

Williams said that intramural
sporting events were an effec-
tive way of smoothing relations.
He also encouraged fraternities
to “go out of their way to
welcome law students to their
parties.”’

He was opposed to the
publication of the Hulfish honor
case. ‘‘You try to have an honor
trial within a vacuum, but word
leaks out,”’ he said, ‘‘ but to blab
it all over the front page of a
newspaper is wrong because it
violates that individual’s
rights.”’

Although he conceded that the
Hulfish case was ‘‘exceptional”’
because he remained on cam-
pus, ‘‘the Ring-tum Phistill

Williams believes’ the
jurisdiction of the honor system
should be ‘‘within the communi-
ty where the reputation of W&L
is immediately at stake.’’ He
questioned ‘‘the practicality” of
applying the honor system out-
side of Lexington.

On upholding the honor code,
Williams said there was a need
for ‘‘strict’’ enforcement.
‘‘Honor is something that
should be assumed and not
necessarily questioned. We
need to create a system where
the people aren’t embarrassed
or afraid to come before the
committee and report an honor
violation,’’ Be gnig.

Jim Foreman, the treasurer
or the Student Activities Board
nnounced he had resigned
rom the board at an SAB
eeting held Sunday night.
Foreman, who has served on
the board for three years, said
Ihe was resigning because he
needed to devote more time to
his senior thesis, an architec-

   
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
   
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
   
  
   
   

field, Virginia.

Bill Tucker, chairman of the
SAB said Foreman had been
considering resignation before
Charlie Hulfish resigned.

Both Tucker and Foreman
reported the SAB’s financial
records are in good shape.
Tucker said the board had ap-
roximately 15 to 16 thousand
ollars going into Spring term.
oreman said he balanced the
books as well as he could after
ancy Dress, and that Tucker
ill be handling the books until
new treasurer is found.

The SAB also voted to recom-
end that the EC appoint Bill
idge as a replacement for
oreman. Ridge was appointed
to the board only two weeks
go. Foreman said Ridge had
been working with him on the
books during the year, and that
Ridge was the logical choice to
fill the vacancy. Foreman add-

Foreman resigns

ed he believed Ridge had plann-
ed to run for treasurer of the
SAB next year.

In other action, the board
discussed an offer for the band
Levon Helm and the All stars.
According to Tucker, the band
has recently formed and is look-
ing for engagements. The band
features performers like Paul
Butterfield, Dr. John, and three
former members of Booker T.
& the MG’s. The deal offered
the SAB included Livingston
Taylor as a warm-up for the
Allstars, at a package price of
$8,500.

The board also discussed they
possibility of financing a
building to house Unversity par-
ties. The building suggested
would be similar to the
pavillion, but would be located
somewhere on W&L property.
Two board members plan to
discuss the idea with the
University treasurer.

The SAB also gave its ap-
proval to plans to have a Spring
Cookout at the pavillion. The
university Food Service,
through Jerry Darrell and Burr
Datz, offered to provide free hot
dogs for the party, if the SAB
would organize the other
aspects of the event. The board
plans to set a date for the party
next week.

 

 

Flu just Red Scare

by Wade A. Forsman

Have you been sick? You’re
not alone. The flu has struck
W&L, along with many other
campuses, harder this year
than in the past. But take heart,
because according to Dr. Fed-
deman of the infirmiry, the
worst is over.

Though it may be disappoin-
ting for some, odds are that the
rash of sickness here is not the
acclaimed Russian flu. Dr. Old
of VMI sent cultures of the virus
found in this area to the Center
of Disease Control (CDC) in
Atlanta three weeks ago.
However, the results have not
yet been received. Despite this
lack of verification, the belief is
that the flu here is of the normal
intestine or diaherrea variety.

Exactly what strain it is,
though, is irrelevant. The strain
is important only to those
developing a vaccine. The
symptoms are basically the
same for whatever kind of flu.
Regardless of the strain, as Dr.

Feddeman says, “you still
hurt.”
How many students have had

the flu this month? Though the
cases are in the daily log, the in-
firmiry has not kept a count,
and could not say offhand. But it
was pointed out that many peo-
ple don’t go to the infirmiry
when they are sick. “Some we
never see,” says Dr. Fed-
deman, ‘“‘so we really don’t
know.”’ The reason Dr. Fed-
deman believes he doesn’t see
everyone is because people
know what to do about the flu.
There is not as vivid an im-
agination as he’s seen in the
past with other flu outbreaks.
The flu has struck college
students particularly hard. Con-
trary to popular belief, the
reason is not because of

-oawegeeueeaeeete°

students en masse style of liv-
ing but because students have
not built up a natural immunity
to the flu. Those over 25, Dr.
Feddeman points out, have a
much smaller chance of cat-
ching it than those under that
age.

To a lesser degree than W&L,
Lexington High School has also
had a prroblem with the flu. But
VMI has been hardest hit. Their
lifestyle is even more favorable
to the flu than outs. Unlike VMI,
there are few people with four
in a room here, Dr. Feddeman
pointed out.

Around the state, the areas
hardest hit have been Faifax
County and the Washington
area along with the Norfolk
Metropolitan region. The
Shenandoah Valley has been
spared except, of course, for its
colleges.

Many of those who go to the
infirmiry go, not for treatment,
but for advice. They are wor-
ried about catching their room-
mate’s or fraternity brother’s
flu, and wonder if there is any
preventative. There isn’t. By
the time someone’s roommate
catches the flu, he’s probably
already spread his germs
around. It’s that contagious.

In one respect, the flu is
similar to the cold: There is no
cure. The only recourse is to do
what’s always been done: rest,
liquids, and aspirin. If it doesn’t
go away, go to the infirmiry.
Dr. Feddeman rejects the
prevalent belief that a_ visit
means forced incarceration for
days on end. He points out that
people with the worst cases
stayed two or three days at the
most.

As Dr. Feddeman said: ‘‘The
moment their temperature goes
down, they go out.”

When is a Journalist

a Times §

(continued from page 1)
reporting, Greene said. The
press has always protested
when public officials receive
free favors, he said, but main-
tains a double standard by hav-
ing no hesitation to receive
themselves.

Greene equated present-day
journalism ethics with that of a
“Times Square pimp hustling
12-year-old girls.’”’ He added,
however, journalism ethics
have “‘infinitely improved over
the period when bribes, free
meals and free trips’’ were used
to buy off reporters. ‘‘We now
disdain bribes,’’ he said.

Journalists are more ethical
than doctors, lawyers, and
statesmen, Greene contended,
“but that’s only a comment on
the ethical standards of our
time.”

“‘Purveying of truth” is the
one critical test of journalism
ethics, Greene said. The people
must not be deceived, he said,
for if they are to govern wisely
they must be aware. That
means the press must “‘fix on
substance rather than form,”
Greene admonished. He ex-
plained that the press must not
just print what people say is the

- truth; it must print the truth.

A code of ethics doesn’t
necessarily promote the truth,
Greene said. As a matter of
fact, according to Greene, jour-
nalists ‘‘have done better
without a code of ethics than
lawyers have with one.”’

Although the Newspaper
Guild has attempted to draw up
a code of ethics, it has largely
failed because of disagreement
on basic issues. Greene pointed
out that one of the major pro-
blems with a code is that
“fierceness of competition (in
journalism ) makes ethical stan-
dards absurdly difficult.”

Greene said ethical problems
in journalism arise because of
conflicts between ends and
means. For instance, Greene
asked, would it be right to steal
a government document which

 

proved the crime of a public of-
ficial? One reporter on the New
York Times said he would lie,
cheat and steal for a good story.
But the Long Island newspaper-
man said that statement is
blatantly unethical because it
indicates the reporter would lie,
cheat and steal for any article.

Greene said there are only a
few occasions when it would be
right to lie, cheat or steal. He
said those occasions would
come up when there is a
‘compelling public necessity”
for a story to come out and the
reporter has “‘exhausted every
honorable way” to acquire the
story.

An example of compelling
public necessity, Greene said,
would arise when a reporter
Saw a document on the desk of a
Pentagon official setting out
plans for a Pentagon coup
d’etat. As Greene put it, “If I
left it there, I would be ethical;
if I stole it, I would be a good
newspaperman.”’

On other ethical issues:

—Greene said he saw no pro-
blem with a journalist posing as
someone else, unless he posed
as someone involved in the
judical process such as a judge
or a policeman, or if he posed as
someone normally expected to
keep things confidential, such
as a priest, lawyer or doctor.

   

quare pimp?

—Greene said journalists’
practice of not turning someone
they know has committed a
crime over to police in order to

acquire information on a
higher-level criminal does not
leave them open to ethical ques-
tions. Police do the same thing
all the time, Greene said. They
give minor criminals immunity
in exchange for testimony in-
dicting leading criminals.

—Greene said journalists
should turn over to police in-
formation they receive from
people speaking on the record
with only second or third hand
information. But he said if the
source tells him something off
the record, he would go to jail to
protect the source.

—Greene condemned biased
reporting, saying “I am a
political neuter,’’ he charged
that some reporters in 1964 had
“gleefully misquoted (Barry)
Goldwater,” while asking Lyn-
don Johnson ‘‘respectful ques-
tions.”” He quoted Jimmy
Breslin, then of the New York
Times, as saying about
Goldwater, ‘“‘The minute I saw
him in Madison Square Garden
Ihad him pegged as a fascist.”’

In concluding his speech,
Greene said journalism ethics
has a long way to go, but some-
day it ‘‘might rise to the level of
a Park Avenue pimp selling
legal aid.”

act honorably all the time.
When you remove a student
from the W&L community,
then I don’t think that you can
expect him to act honorably. If
a person’s action doesn’t affect
the W&L community, then I
don’t think you can penalize
him.”

As expected, Gallagher ap-
proved of the Ring-tum Phi's
printing of the name of a recent-
ly convicted honor offender.
Gallagher said, ‘‘I feel that it
should have been published
because Mr. Hulfish was mak-
ing a mockery of the honor
system by staying around cam-
pus. The E.C. didn’t act. Some
of their own members said ‘but
he’s such a nice guy.’ I think the
student body should be made
aware that an unwanted person
was using them.”

Contrary to popular belief
that the E.C. is too powerful,
Gallagher said, ‘‘I don’t think
the E.C. is exercising the power
they have to the fullest degree,
as in the Hulfish case, and in
making the committees funded
by the E.C. financially accoun-
table. I think that they can con-
trol these committees a lot
more than they have been will-
ing to do. The E.C. has an
obligation to do this.”

Sensitive to the entertain-
ment needs of _ students,
Gallagher believes that some
priority of E.C. appropriations
should exist for the Student Ac-
tivities Board. He said, “I
definitely think that since the
SAB is the only organization on
campus which provides enter-
tainment for the students out-
side the fraternities, then I
think they should get the bulk of
the money.”

In an effort to make student
organizations more account-
able to the E.C., Gallagher said,
“I would require the ad hoc
E.C. members to give weekly
reports as to what went on at
these meetings. I would play a
major role in the selection of the
co-chairmen and of the commit-
tee members. I would question
them about their feelings on
open meetings and parties. This

would play a big part in my .

decision on whether or not they
should serve on that commit-
tee.”

Speaking to the issue of a stu-
dent’s rights when he is involv-
ed in a Student Control hearing,
Gallagher said, ‘As I outlined
in one of my recent editorials,
Ithink the SCC constitution
should be rewritten to take into
consideration the rights of the
accused. For instance, people
shouldn’t be compelled to

 

testify against themselves.”

‘‘T am in favor of independent
exams,” Gallagher said. ‘‘I feel
we should have redinement
seminars on the honor system
for the upperclassmen. I think
this would .remove the am-
biguities on what honor viola-
tions are on exams. You could
invite faculty members to give
their views on this subject at
such a meeting.”

Gallagher did not believe that
admissions standards should be
lowered for minority ap-
plicants. He said, ‘‘I think there
are many qualified members of
minorities out in the country. I
think that the admissions com-
mittee has to enlarge its
endeavor to appeal to these peo-
ple.”

Answering another question
concerning the decline in ad-
missions, Gallagher said, “I
think they’re going to have to
send out more propaganda
brochures to more people in dif-
ferent parts of the country than
they have in the past. I think a
study should be undertaken on
the feasibility of coeducation
again. Coeducation would at-
tract more applicants.”

Advocating improved rela-
tionships with the law school,
Gallagher said, “I definitely
think they should be improved.
I think the law students have a

lot to offer the undergraduates

and the undergrads a lot to offer
law students. I think we should
add another law_ school
representative to the E.C. We
should carefully look at some of
the changes they have proposed
for the honor code, and see
which ones would be beneficial.
I think undergrads could help

the law students become
familiar with the honor
system.”’

Interested in improving the
relationships between the
University and the town,
Gallagher suggested that ‘‘the
school needs to set up a council
comprised of town fathers,
faculty members and student
leaders. They can meet once a
month and discuss tbe problems
that arise between the town and
the school. W&L community
service could be discussed.

When asked whether or not he
felt that he could work effec-
tively with Washington Hall ad-
ministrators in view of his past
differences of opinion with that
group, Gallagher responded, ‘‘I
can get along with people fairly
well in a close working environ-
ment. I think Washington Hall
will recognize that I represent
the students’ wants. I feel that
tbey’ll regard me as any other
representative of the students.’’

Chairmen receive accounting guide lines

by Paul Daugherty

A memorandum reminding
all student subcommitteess of
their obligations to the student
body was issued Monday to sub-
committee chairmen by Ex-
ecutive Committee Secretary
Neil Pentifallo.

The memo is simply a com-
pilation of all motions passed by
the EC this year dealing with
the responsibilities of student
subcommittees, said Pentifallo.

The crux of the memo is a sec-
tion detailing the accounting
guidelines that subcommittees
are expected to follow. The
guidelines stipulate that,
among other things, no student
organization may authorize a
loan. This provision was promp-
ted by an incident which oc-

urred last spring, when former

tudent Activities Board Co-
chairman Charlie Hulfish took
out a personal loan from the
SAB treasurery, which receives
its money from the central stu-
dent body fund. Hulfish promis-
ed to pay back the loan within a
month, but didn’t do so until the

fall, when the EC first
discovered he had taken the
loan.

A requirement that all net
profits of student subcom-
mittee, must revert to the cen-
tral student body fund at the
end of the school year was also
included in the accounting
guidelines. This provision was
spurred by the actions of the
Contact committee, which the
EC discovered had kept over
$800 in two separate bank ac-
counts over the summer, a
violation of the student body
constitution.

Other guidelines listed in the
memo require that subcom-
mittees retain all receipts, to

-make sure that all the checks

they write are for legitimate
purposes, and that if receipts
are to be collected and kept
overnight, night deposit bags at
the United Virginia Bank are to
be used.

The memo also outlined other
subcommittee obligations,
namely that meetings must be
open except when votes are be-

ing takes, and that subcom-
mittees must receive EC ap-
proval to throw a party.

Many of the motions included
on the memorandum were pass-
ed in the fall. Pentifallo defend-
ed its tardiness by saying that
all the motions on the memo
were included in the minutes of
the EC meetings in which they
were passed. He also said that
each subcomittee chairman is
provided with a copy of the
minutes of all Executive Com-
mittee meetings.

Junior EC rep. Jack Bovay
call the memo the EC’s attempt
to ‘‘watchdog’’ the subcom-
mittees.

“Subcommittees should be
made accountable to the
students whose money they are
spending,” he said. ‘The ac-
counting guidelines are on way
of doing this.’’

Enforcement of the provi-
sions mandated in the memo
will be the responsibility of the
various EC members who serve
as ad-hoc members of the sub-
committees, Pentifallo said.

 

Bovay on the honor system

(continued from page 2)

to talk to the Ring-tum Phi
about an honor case. But the
most important way to see the
honor system is upheld is to
vote to remove a person if he’s
guilty, Bovay says.

Asked about a proposal that
honor offenses be limited to
placeswhere students represent
themselves as being from
W&L, Bovay says, “I would
find it hard to differentiate bet-
ween places where someone
represents himself as a W&L
student and places where he
does not do so.’’ You ‘‘can’t put
a geographical or time boun-
dary’’ on acting honorably or
dishonorably. The honor system
is “‘a spirit to get W&L students
to act honorably at all times.”’

Talking about other subjects,
Bovay said coeducation could
help admissions. ‘‘Coeducation
would probably play a very big
role in increasing quality ap-
plicants and that would be a
major thing.

On relations between law
students and undergraduates,
Bovay says what is needed is a
“better information process.”
He says things such as the Stu-
dent Activities Board’s ‘“‘At-

titude Adjustment Hour’’ at the

law school in the fall could help
the information process. He
said Student Bar Association of-
ficers speaking at Natural
Bridge may also ease tensions.
On relations with police,
Bovay says the most pressing
problem is the noise ordinance
violations. He said perhaps the
IFC, Dean John and Dean Mur-
phy could have some talks with
the city commissioners. He also
says the school’s attorney could
go over the statute and ‘“‘see if
there are any ways of getting
around it.” He adds that some
people from the University
could lobby with the city com-
missioners. Even _ faculty
members should take an in-
terest in the issue Bovay says,
because the ordinance

which is a ‘“‘very integral part of
W&L.”’

On the issue of Student Con-
trol, Bovay said, “I believe the
motion I made a few weeks ago
summed up my opinion that
Student Control should rewrite
its purposes and procedures
and statement of purpose so it is
more clearly defined in the
areas of preliminary investiga-
tion, procedure to be followed
during the Student Control
hearing and the rights of the ac-
cused student.”

On Student Control’s drug
penalties, Bovay said ‘‘As long
as there is a Universitypolicy on
drugs, then Student Control is
going to have to abide by that
policy. Last year’s penalties

“were way too stiff(when they

sent letters home to parents).”’

(continued from page 1)

for the proposed addition of a
third law school EC member.
Tom Healy, EC law school
representative, proposed the
motion for a third represen-
tative so that all three law
classes would be represented on
the EC. Presently, the third
year class is represented, and
the first and second year
students share one represen-
tative.

Past law school representa-
tion had been one Ecmember
for 120 law students. Supports of
the proposed increase argued
that the law school has increas-
ed in size by 50 percent, and in
order to achieve the same ratio
as before, the number of
representatives to the EC
should grow from two to three.
“By giving each law class its
own representative, it is hoped
that a more harmonious law
school-undergraduate relation-
ship will result,’’ proponents
argued.

Opponents to the law school’s
increased EC _ representation
questioned whether
threemembers might not be a
disproportionate reparesenta-
tion of that body.

Based on voter turnout, the
EC will decide at next Monday’s
meeting whether to continue the
referendum for two more days,
as prescribed in the constitu-
tion.

Also on the ballot will be a
revision to the honor code pro-
posed by the law school’s ad hoc
committee which examined the
honor code in-depth. The law
school has recommenced that
some convicted honor violators
be allowed to reapply to W&L.

Under the law school’s sug-
gestions, a verdict of guilty
would be made on the presump-
tion that the person would be
dismissed from the University,
but he may show reason for be-
ing allowed to reapply. Persons
found guilty would not be allow-
ed to appeal thier punishment,
but would have to appeal the
verdict.
