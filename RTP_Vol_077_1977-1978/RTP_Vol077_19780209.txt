Hulfish resigns

Charlie Hulfish, co-chairman
of the Student Activities Board,
resigned his position as head of
that committee amid a new
wave of controversy surroun-
ding the SAB.

Hulfish’s resignation was of-
ficially announced at Sunday
night’s SAB meeting. He was
not in attendance.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi, Hulfish attributed his
resignation to academic respon-
sibilities and the time commit-
ment of being co-chairman of
the SAB. “I was going to resign
-after Fancy Dress anyway,”’ he
said.

“The SAB wasn’t a good
working atmosphere,’’ Hulfish
also charged. He called the
members “apathetic,” leaving
the two chairmen to do all the
work. “I don’t think it was a
good Activities Board,” Hulfish
continued.

Asked whether the resigna-
tion of Hulfish would have any
effect on Fancy Dress; SAB
chairman Bill Tucker said
“no.”’ This year’s ball has been
very well coordinated, he said.
Tucker did say ‘‘We’ll miss him

as a worker.”
Tucker said Hulfish had no

particular contacts or areas of

experience which will effect the
smooth operation of the SAB
over the rest of the year. He
said he could handle the duties
of sole chairman. ‘‘Anyone can
do it if it’s well-run,” he said.
Tucker added that he will
recommend a single chairman
be appointed next year because
if a committee has a voice of
“final authority’, no one can
pass the buck.

Tucker said he got along with
Hulfish pretty well. ‘‘I was very
curious to see how the year
would go,” he said, ‘Charlie
and I have different per-
sonalities.’’ He stated that there
were no major personality pro-
blems, although “I would get
embarrassed by what he said.”
Tucker did not elaborate.

The Executive Committee
voted unanimously on Monday
not to appoint someone to take
Hulfish’s place on the SAB. Bill
Tucker will act as the chairman
of the SAB until the end of the
term.

Mock Convention seeks

new blood,

by Jim Ingham .

Although the Mock Conven-
tion is still two years away, the
Steering Committee has
already started paying plans
for the nationally known event.
John Trump, co-chairman of
the event, said that an operation
is now taking place to usher in
new committee leadership, and
that contacts are now being
made to the Republican Party
for information pertaining to
the 1980 election.

Trump said that he and the
other co-chairman, Jim
McNider, will both be
graduated by the time the next
Mock Convention rolls around.
He said that their main task for
now is to gradually let go of the
administrative reigns of the
Steering Committee and to let
their assistants take control.
These assistants are Dick
Schoenfeld, Craig Cornett and
Sid Simmons.

Trump said that the Steering
Committee is also in the process
of contacting the Republican
Party Headquarters in hopes of
gaining information on possible
candidates for the 1980
presidential election. Trump
said it would be the work of the
Steering Committee to “keep
track of what the possible can-
didates are doing and to stay in
contact with these candidates
personally.”” Trump said the
Steering Committee is also sen-
ding letters out to possible
donors who might help finance

leadership

the convention.

Trump said that there were a
number of steps being taken to
insure that the handling of
finances will be better in the
1980 convention than they were
in the 1976 convention. ‘The
new Harris Computer system
will be used to insure more ac-
curacy in accounting pro-

Fraternity checklist
after break

The Fraternity Inspection
Committee will go around to all
fraternities after mid-winter
break with a checklist of high
priority items required for
every residence, it was an-
nounced at the Interfraternity
Council meeting on Tuesday.

The checklists will include:
the availability of fire ex-
tinguishers and access to other
fire-fighting equipment; the
maintenance of fire doors; in-
stallation of smoke dectectors;
accessibility to fire escapes;
evidence of debris and
dangerous materials; posting of
emergency signs and fire exits;
and the overall outside ap-
pearance of the houses.

Failure to comply with the
maintenance requests will
result in punitive action. The
Fraternity Inspection Commit-

tee will also make unannounced
-spot-checks of selected frater-

nities to guarantee compliance
with the checklist recommenda-
tions.

In other actions discussed at
Tuesday’s IFC meeting:

—Phi Delta Theta and Sigma
Nu were placed on conduct pro-
bation for one week.

—It was announced that the
University will pay all royalty
costs required by the new
copyright laws up to $1,000 for
each fraternity.

—A food seminar involving
the formation of a _ food
cooperative and_ kitchen
management will be conducted
by Jerry Darrell after mid-
winter break.

—Chris Volk was voted editor
of next year’s Rush’ Book.

Despite the steeped traditions
which have mingled with the
regal columns of Washington
and Lee for more than 100 years
now to make it the classical
Southern University, W&L has
a number of “‘firsts.’’

nalism school in the country
was founded, where Kappa
Alpha fraternity and Omricron
Delta Kappa honorary society
have their roots and, according
to legend, where the first
baseball pitcher’ threw a
curveball.

W&L’s most pioneering effort
seems
establishment of the first jour-
nalism school in the country.
Coming 35 years before Joseph
Pulitzer thought to donate $2
million to the formation of Col-
umbia University’s school of
journalism, General Robert E.

 

W&L is where the first jour-:

Lee’s establishment in 1969 of 50
“press scholarships’’ seems
remarkable indeed. His idea
was to give prospective jour-
nalists free tuition in the
classics plus one hour of on-the-
job training each day.

The one and only jounalism
professor at the time, William
Johnson, explained Lee’s idea

Washington and Lee ‘firsts’

by saying, ‘We do not hope to
make men fit for the editorial
chair at once, but we do hope to
give them as good an education
as possible that they may make
more cultivated editors.”

Apparently, Lee’s offer found
few, if any, takers. Lee died in
1870. The idea of a journalism
school lived long after, even
though W&L had to drop the
idea of journalism scholarships
in 1878 because of the lack of in-
terest. In 1921 journalism
returned to W&L and situated
itself in Reid Hall, where it now
remains.

With the return of a jour-
nalism schocl to W&L and with
the flourishing of other jour-
nalism schools, Robert E. Lee’s
dream truly proved to be ahead
of its time. Editorialists called
it an ‘‘absurdity”’ when Lee first
proposed it but, as with many

Fencing club
receives $1200
from E.C.

by Randy Smith

Washington and Lee’s year-
old Fencing Club was given
$1,200 at Monday’s Executive
Committee meeting.

Dr. James Worth, university
psychologist and coach of the
Fencing Club, had originally
asked the EC for $2,000 to buy
uniforms and equipment for the
group.

Although fencing has receiv-
ed little recognition as a sport
here, Dr. Worth said that
W&L’s “‘young’”’ fencing team
is dedicated and “‘not just a fly-
by-night outfit.”’ The current
team was started by him in
January, 1977.

“I think it’s very valuable for
W&L to have a fencing team; I
think it’s a great sport,’ Dr.
Worth explained. “Fencing of-
fers a guy a chance to compete
without prior experience.”’

He estimated the cost of out-
fitting a nine man team at $125
per man. Members of the Fenc-
ing Club are currently fencing
with their own equipment. The
$2,000 figure also included
“about $800’’ for electrical scor-
ing equipment used in matches.

Doug Perkins, senior EC
representative, said, ‘$2,000 is
a large chunk of money to
benefit such a small group. The
money should come from the
athletic department.”

Dr. Worth explained that he
had gone to the athletic depart-
ment last spring with a request
for funds and had been told by
Director William McHenry that
he would receive no money. Dr.
Worth added that he was trying
the “bandwagon approach,” in
the hope that support from the

as is

The University Council voted
down last week two motions
designed to make academics in
the spring more stringent.

The first motion, to increase
the number of credits required
for graduation from 115 to 121,

‘was defeated 21-3.

The second motion, which
would make a six credit course
load mandatory in the spring -
term, was defeated 17-7.

Both motions were again con-
sidered in this week’s faculty
meeting. Faculty meetings are
closed, and the Ring-tum Phi
was unable to get in touch with
its secret source and find out
the results. The results will be
forthcoming. '

Louisville editor
on. Press Ethics

by Randy Smith
“There is not much doubt in
my mind that the organs of the
press are not believed by the

public’”’ said Robert C. Clark,
executive editor of the
Louisville Courier-Journal

andTimes, in a speech given in
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s Lee Chapel Monday night.

Clark’s lecture, entitled ‘‘Our
Beleagured Press: Our Ethics
On Trial,” focused on the lack
of credibility currentlv suffered
by the print media in the United
States.

“Since 1961, television has led
newspapers in credibility,”
Clark stated. He cited many
public opinion polls and surveys
documenting the ‘‘disillusion-
ment’? and “lack of public
respect for newspapers.”

To correct what Washington
Post ombudsman Charles Seib
calls ‘‘the pervasive distrust of
the media,” Clark stressed that
“print journalism must become
more responsible’ to the
American public. This end
could be accomplished through
“greater balance’’ and “‘higher
news judgments,” he said.

Clark explained that for
many newspapers, the editorial
policy ‘‘often sets the tone’’ for
the news section. The public can
perceive this bias’ he continued,
so there is a great need to make
distinct the separation of news
reporting and the editorial posi-
tion of a newspaper.

The ‘‘widespread’’ and “‘in-
discriminate use of the unnam-
ed source’’ was also suggested
by Clark as a reason for the
public’s ‘‘distrust’’ of
newspapers. Unless there is a
“clear need’’ to keep a source
confidential — such as possible
physical harm — he should be
named, Clark said. ‘Poltiical

axes can be ground with un- .

named sources.”’

‘“‘A liason between the press
and the Central Intelligence
Agency can only harm the

credibility of the press,’’ Clark
stated. ‘‘We cannot pose as
others or let others pose as the
press,’’ he emphasized. ‘“‘Is the
integrity of the press to be
subverted to whatever the spy
trade wants?”’

“It is not only conflicts (of in-
terest), but the potential for
conflicts (of interest) which
must be guarded against,’
Clark said. He outlined the
ownership of stocks and bonds
by business writers and the ac-
ceptance of free trips and gifts
as possible conflicts of interest
which had contributed to the
undermining of newspaper
credibility.

To remedy the  public’s
wariness of newspaper content,
Clark suggested that journalists
subscribe to one of the various
codes of ethics stressing respon-
sibility, accuracy, and im-
partiality.

He also recommended that
newspapers accept criticism
better by printing corrections in
a prominent place and by hiring
an ombudsman (an “‘inhouse”’
critic who analyses. the
newspaper's performance on a
day-to-day basis).

‘‘We must have ever higher
standards,” Clark concluded.
“To uphold the First Amend-
ment we must have public ser-
vice and public trust.”

A dog’s life in Rockbridge

“I pick up between 450 to 500
dogs a year,” said G. Berns
Conner, dog warden for
Rockbridge County. ‘‘And not
more than 10 or 12 of them ever
are claimed.”

“T answered 731 complaints
last year, and that is more than
I can handle,” he said. ‘Yet
people get-on me anyways for
picking up their dogs.”’

The county has had a serious
dog problem ever since he
became dog warden 12 years
ago, Conner said. Each year,
dogs -destroy livestock, spread
diseases, bite people and cause
expensive property damage.

And it is not the dogs’ fault,
Conner stressed.

The fault lies with county
residents and college students
who own dogs and forget that it
is their responsibility to care for
the animals, Conner said.

“Students sometimes leave
for the holidays and leave their
dogs behind,” he said. ‘“They
leave the animals outside with
nothing but an opened bag of

dog food and expect them to
survive.”

What happens, however, is
that the dogs die of thirst or
from cold weather or make
nuisances of themselves by kill-
ing livestock and damaging
farm crops, Conner said.

Often, Conner winds up pick-
ing up the dogs.

The dogs Conner picks up are
brought to the county pound,
where they will be kept for five
days. Dogs that are not claimed
by owners, and few are, are sold
to medical schools. Diseased
dogs are put to sleep, according
to Conner. :

Conner said he frequently
receives complaints from coun-
ty farmers that dogs kill
livestock and destroy crops.
The county recorded the deaths
of 70 sheep and one cow in 1977
were caused by stray dogs.

Conner, however, said he
does not have enough time to in-
vestigate every complaint. He
is the only dog catcher in the
county and when he is not able

Young Democrats
support ERA

At a recent meeting of the
Washington and Lee University
Young Democrats the club
adopted a resolution in support
of the proposed Equal Rights
Amendment. In taking this ac-
tion, the Young Democrats, for
the first time since the
organization was founded two
years ago, announced its of-
ficial position concerning a con-
troversial legislative issue. The
resolution to actively support
the Equal Rights Amendment
was written and moved by the
club’s Political Affairs Commit-
tee and was acepted by the club
in a nearly unanimous vote. The
Equal Rights Amendment will
probably be the most divisive
issue considered by the General
Assembly this legislative ses-
sion.

Young Democrats also plan to

sometimes solve it themselves

shot by farmers last year, ac-
cording to Conner.

The only answer to dog the
problem, according to Conner,
is that county residents and col-
lege students who own dogs
must accept a sense of respon-
sibility and take better care of
their pets.

Jackie Boyden, law school
representative, proposed a mo-
tion that the Fencing Club
receive $1,200 to cover the cost
of uniforms and weapons, but
not the electrical scoring equip-
ment. The motion passed 7-5;
the money will come from the
EC’s funding account.

In other action by the EC:

—It was announced that
Charlie Hulfish, co-chairman of
the Student Activities Board,
had resigned. Steve Abraham,
ad hoc member of the SAB, said
that it was the wish of the SAB
to have only one chairman.
Jack Bovay, junior represen-
tative, motioned that no other
chairman be appointed in
Hulfish’s place. Motion passed
unanimously.

—Jim Underhill, president of
the EC, said that the chairman
of the Student Control Commit-
tee, Jim McNider, would ap-
pear before the EC on Feb. 20.
Underhill explained that all EC
members would receive copies
of the SCC statement of pro-
cedures to ‘‘become familiar
with the committee.’ Underhill
said there were possible con-
stitutional discrepancies with
Student Control.

UT succeeds with O’Neill

A RING-TUM PHI COMMENTARY

by Parker Potter

‘“‘There’s gold in the West.”’
There’s gold in the Troubadour
Theatre too. Eugene O’Neill’s
Desire Under the Elms is a rich
vein, well mined. This senior
thesis production directed by
Chris Willett must be com-
mended for its deft handling, a
difficult assignment.

In a play such as this the
characters are ‘‘pure_ in-
dividuals, capable of choice and
responsibility,’ the major pro-
blem for both the writer and the
director is in holding the play
together. A state full of isolated
individuals such as we have
here could easily become a
state full of isolated
monologues. But such is not the
case.

To each character, the farm
is something different, yet it is
powerfully important. To
Ephraim, the father, it is
Ephraim; to Abbie it is a

coveted home; and to Eben it is
the memory of his mother.
These disparate symbolications
of the farm are brought
together, though, in the well-
meshed levels of intensity
\within which each of the three
pursues his own good.

An even more difficult con-
cept in the play to grasp, yet one
which is exceedingly well
handled, is the various por-
trayals of the characters.
Eben’s mother, the last wife of

“old Ephraim Cabot, is dead

when the curtain rises. Yet her
presence is almost constant
throughout the play. Eben sees
both himself and the farm as ex-
tensions of her; Abbie sees her
as the key to unlocking Eben’s
heart; while Ephraim cannot
rid himself of her memory when
he sees her living image in
Eben.

All this serves to illustrate the
principal difficulty with the

play. Each character has a
completely different conception
of the world. They clearly see
the same things, but such wide-
ly different interpretations are
attached to these personal ob-
jects that there is no common
ground. Each character has
“valued” his way to isolation.
Yet they are all here together in
‘one play and ‘must co-exist
together in the world of the
Cabot farm.

It is this tangled cacophony of
values, so well handled, that
makes the last scene work so
well. Abbie, to prove her love
for Eben, has killed thier own
baby, and they are about to be
taken off to prison. In tragedy,
the result of misunderstanding,
an understanding family unit
suddenly emerges. In Abbie and
Eben, there are two characters
loving each other with no str-
ings attached. But enough
theoretical discussions — on to
the performers in this play
itself.

David Chester as Eben was
given one of the most difficult
assignments of the season in
this role. Eben embodies a
curious duality which is quite
hard to portray. On the one
hand, he is not overly bright.
(Anyone who has played a
stupid person knows just how
hard that is; the line between
sounding like a stupid character
and sounding like a stupid actor
is fine indeed.) On the other
hand, he is possessed, driven by
the association of his mother
with the farm. The complexity
arises when one realizes that,
even though many slow-witted
people can be very persistant in
following something, rarely is it

group, known as the Theater
Chamber Players, includes
Leon Fleisher as conductor;
Dina Koston, pignist; Pina Car-
mirelli, violinist; and Phyllis
Bryn-Julson, soprano. The
ensemble also includes a
mezzo-soprano, baritone, and
performers of the following in-
struments: flute, French horn,
violin, viola, cello, contrabass,
guitar, harpsichord, celesta,
and multiple percussion.

Washington’s Theater
Chamber Players was founded
in 1968 by Leon Fleisher and
Dina Koston and gave its first
concerts during the 1968-69
season at the Washington
Theater Club. It is a non-profit
organization whose purpose is
to present outstanding contem-
porary music and music of the
past in performances of excep-
tionally high quality by artists
of the highest calibre. The
ensemble draws on music of
many periods, relating new
music to its particular
antecedents.

The Theater Chamber
Players present annually in
Washington a series of five
chamber music programs
which have made a unique con-

I read in last week’s Phi that
my alternating critic took ex-

Elvis Costello. Well, never let it
be said that this is one critic
that lets sleeping dogs lie.
Therefore, in reaction to my
colleague’s good-natured
counterpoint (Christ, I feel like
Shana Alexander), I present
this first review for your enter-

dent in the knowledge that I
have indeed listened to this

lucidly as my stomach will

tribution to the city’s musical
life. In 1973 the Players found a
new home at the Smithsonian
Institution, performing in the
Baird Auditorium of the
Museum of Natural History
under the auspices of the Divi-
sion of Performing Arts. At the
end of that season (1973-74), the
group was asked by the
Smithsonian to become a
‘‘chamber ensemble in
residence,’ an honor never
before accorded any — or
ensemble.

The Board of Trustees of the
John F. Kennedy Center recent-
ly named the Theater Chamber
Players to be resident chamber
ensemble of theKennedy
Center. They will perform in the
chamber music hall, which is
scheduled to be completed in
early 1979. They will make their
New York debut this month at
the 92nd Street Young Men’s
Hebrew Association, at the in-
vitation of Alan Marks and
Omus Hirshbein.

The Theater Chamber
Players’ program here is the
same as their New York City
debut program, including
works by Arrigo, Webern,
Bach, Baccherine, and Ligeti.

“The Vinyl Junkie”

There must have been
something wrong with my copy
of this album (albumen). It
didn’t sound right. I thought for
a minute that it was my turn-
table’s fault, but the remainder
of my album collection sounds
fine.

So, in a fit of frustration
(y’see, I’ve tried for years to be
a scholar of serious rock com-
position and performance), I
threw the damned ELP disc
across the room. It flew
beautifully! So I took it out in
the front yard and discovered
that it made an_ excellent
plaything, and have enjoyed the
album ever since. True to the ti-
tle, it ‘‘works,”’ but only as a
frisbee.

ye and Lar: From Che Bookstore

As soon as a significant sampling of the student

quotable? Very doubtful; most women are not

body votes in favor of having women share their
everyday lives as well as their hectic social hours,
along comes Valentine’s Day to put the spotlight
back on romance. Ever since poor old Adam in the
Garden of Eden discovered the joys — and sorrows
— of knowledge (carnal?), humanity has tried to
express in language the delights and torments of
love — what Plato called ‘‘that grave mental
disease.”’

In an hour or so of browsing through some dic-
tionaries of quotations one can discover the wide
gamut of elations and agonies caused by the willful
god of love. Love can be a ‘‘sweeping of the heart.”’
Says one writer; another says ‘‘the pest of love gives
the most unrest.” Sir Walter Scott sings that ‘‘love
is heaven and heaven is love.”’ In it ‘‘the sweetest
joy and the wildest woe,”’ according to Bailey. And
the playwright, Philip Barry, claims that ‘“‘love is
two minds without a single thought.”

The collections contain very few quotes from
women. Did they feel too deeply to become

given to silent passions. However, the men quoted
hold forth about women — mostly in tormented
tones. Oscar Wilde, that quotation editor’s delight —
says that ‘“‘men all want to be a woman’s first love
— women like to be man’s last romance.”

King Edward the VIII of England gave up a
throne for the ‘‘woman I love” but Nicholas Murray
Butler said “It is better to have loved and lost then
never to have lost at all.’”’ A psychologist calls love
merely ‘‘a conflict between reflexes and reflec-
tions.”’ Martin Luther is attributed with the remark

Wrestlers put lock
on ODAC title

by Mark Peterson

The wrestling Generals com-
pleted a second consecutive
undefeated season in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Tuesday evening by defeating
league rival Hampton-Sydney
45-3. The victory, which raised
the team’s overall record to 5-3
rounded out a demanding week
of wrestling which included a
28-15 setback to powerful Liber-
ty Baptist and an impressive
showing in the Pembrook In-
vitational on Saturday.

In drubbing Hampton-Sydney
the Generals firmly established
themselves as the overwhelm-
ing favorite in the upcoming
Conference tournament. The
team was led by Mike Deighan
(142), Jim Flippen (158), and
Ollie Mowry (HVW) all of
whom registered pins.
Freshman Ed Kramer (118),
returning to action for the first
time since a December knee in-
jury, also gave an impressive
showing in winning 25-0. Other
victors included Ray Gross
(150), Tom Oxendine (177) and
tri-captain Ed Rodgers (167). In
addition, tri-captains Howdy
Knipp (126) and Dan Kniffen
(190) received forfeit victories.

The Pembrook Invitational,

held last Saturday, was one of
the most successful of the year
for theGenerals with five men
placing. Dan Kniffen earned se-
cond place honors, Ed Rodgers
took third and Ray Gross, Ollie
Mowry and Howdy Knipp
brought home fourth place
hardware, with the latter clear-
ly giving the team’s most im-
pressive performance. Though
no team standings were record-
ed, the Generals certainly
would have placed had there
been.

Even in the loss to Liberty
Baptist several bright signs
were evident. The team’s up-
perweight class put on its best
showing of the year with Dan
Kniffen pinning his oppenent
and Tom Oxendine and Ollie
Mowry also winning. In addi-
tion, Howdy Knipp continued
his outstanding wrestling with a
victory.

With classes in recess, the
team picks up its pace this week
with a total of eight meets dur-
ing the vacation period. It all
begins with a home match on
Friday against Davidson Col-
lege and concludes in Boston
with meets against such promi-
nent schools as Lowell Tech,
MIT, and Harvard.

Generals crush
Eastern Mennonite

by Mark Mitchell
Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team continued their
brilliant string of offensive per-

formances with a 103-75 win ©

over Eastern Mennonite last
Thursday night.

In front of a small crowd at
Doremus Gymnasium, the
young Royals started the game
by shooting extremely well. In
fact, their outside shooting gave
them the lead most of the first
half.

While the Royals, were
shooting from twenty feet, the
Generals stayed close by work-
ing the ball inside for easy
shots. W&L also showed great
determination under the offen-
sive boards, sometimes getting
five successive offensive re-
bounds before scoring.

Despite the Generals ex-
cellent offensive execution; the
Royals were ahead by four with
six minutes to go in the half.
The Royals point guard was too
quick to cover, it seemed. But
Wenke, master of drawing the
charge, drew a couple of offen-
sive fouls, sending the Royals’
point guard to the bench.
Without their star guard,

Eastern Mennonite could not
handle the Generals’ pressure.
As a result, W&L led 40-34 at
the half.

In the second half, Wenke
continued to draw offensive
fouls, fouling the starting point
guard out of the game. Then,
Dennis went on a scoring ram-
page.

The Royals reacted by apply-
ing full-court pressure with
ag. 15 minutes to go,
desperately trying to get back
into the ballgame. Wenke threw
a long pass to Collins in an att-
mept to foil the zone press. Col-
lins, seeing that he had a 2-on-1
situation, drove to the hoop, and
dunked it over a_ stunned
defender.

After Collins had thus signall-
ed that the game was over, Den-
nis worked free underneath
several times to give the
Generals a 59-40 lead.

A few minutes later, the
Generals applied full-court
pressure. The pressure so
devastated the Royals, that
with 10 minutes remaining,
W&L led by 75-50, and the only
question was whether the
Generals would go on to score
100 points.

   

Cagers defeat Shenandoah
for sixth straight win

by Ken Mastrelli

Larry Meyers and Dave
Leunig both scored 17 points
each here Monday night to help
W&L win its sixth straight
basketball game, 99-88, over the
clumsy but high-scoring
Hornets from Shenandoah.

Despite vying with Shenan-
doah’s Tom Marple for the
game’s high-scoring honors at
29 points, Pat Dennis had a bad

night from the floor. But, with.
Myers muscling his man on the

inside and Dave Leunig’s 20-
footers from the outside, the
Generals managed to keep pace
with the hot shooting Hornets
throughout the first half, which
ended tied at 44.

The first half was filled with
fouls, putting both teams in the
one-and-one situation early in
the second quarter. The
Hornets managed to cash in on
a number of three-point plays in
that first half which saw both
teams turn the ball over time

and again on bad passes and of-
fensive fouls.

Maybe it was the cold gym,
but the pace of the game seem-
ed rather sluggish, although the
close score throughout the con-
test kept the meager audience
of 150 shivering partisans glued
to their seats.

The cold weather did not stop
Larry Meyer, however. The
sophomore forward is looking
better each game and may be
the Generals’ most consistent
player beside Dennis. Meyer
had three crucial steals, all
within a time-span of five
minutes.

At the other forward spot
Junior Dave Leunig had eight
rebounds and hustled all night
long on the Generals’ man-to-
man full-court press.

Canfield must be happy that
his center position is looking
strong , as Ardith Collins and
Bob Smitherman combined for
18 points. Beside contributing 10
points at center, Smitherman
also biocked three shots. The
Generals did get some help mid-
way through the second-half
which they normally can’t ex-
pect. It came in the form of
those men with the zebra-
striped shirts who run up and
down the court with whistles in
their mouths.

With the score 66-64, and
Sheanandoah still very much in
the game, Hornets’ coach Jim
Edmondson was slapped with
his second technical foul of the
night. Meyers, who had just
been fouled, hit three of four
shots as Edmondson fumed and
fretted on the bench. You could
see the steam rising off him
from the press box. Honest.

Another hot Hornet was
William Hill. His heroics kept
Shenandoah close for the most
of the game and the Generals
were only able to pull away
when he had to sit down because
of foul trouble in the second
half.

For Fallon, enthusiasm is the
key to W&L’S football success

by Jim Barnes

Gary Fallon, the new head
football coach, approached the
young man with a_ heavily
notated copy of the football
team roster out of one of last
year’s programs. He surveyed
the six foot two-and-a-half inch
featherweight and: asked, “I
don’t remember your name .
Where are you on this roster?”’
The young man replied, ‘‘I‘m
not a football player, sir. I just
want to ask you a few questions
for the Ring-tum-Phi, the stu-
dent newspaper.

One thing’s for sure, Fallon is
going to exhaust all the
possibilities, and even some
unimaginable ones as evidenc-
ed by the above exchange, in
order to mold the Generals into
a winner on the gridiron.

So what is the basic formula
this inspiring new coach brings
to W&L? Fallon says, ‘I want
to communicate the feeling I
have in me to my staff and to
the individual players. I’m a

very enthusiastic and intense
guy. The kids have a great
hunger to be motivated. If I can
transmit my enthusiasm for the
game to them, the winning will
come.”’

Although Saturday’s program
may judge the Generals to be
less than the equal of some of
their opponents based on
physical data and past record,
Fallon believes that he can
breach these gaps with en-
thusiasm. “It’s gotta help,”
gushes the new coach, “I’ve got
to hope that we’ll be capable of
competing against all of our op-
ponents. You can build up con-
fidence in a guy to the point
where he’ll say. ‘I’m going to
win.’ After that point,” repeats
Fallon, ‘“‘the winning will
come.”

After getting each player to
realize his potential, Fallon
hopes to channel each in-
dividual’s drive into a team ef-
fort. Fallon says, ‘“‘They’ve got

to be thinking all the time. Each
kid has got to be disciplined in
doing his job. They’ve got to
have confidence in their team-
mates’ ability to do the job.”

Another key element of a win-
ning football program, said
Fallon, is the nature in which
practice was conducted in the
week proir to gametime. “I
want them to want to come to
practice,” he said. Fallon add-
ed that “the competitive spirit
should reach a peak on Satur-
day. If you can’t get yourself
up, that’s a cop-out. He also
said, ‘“You can win close games
if you’re mentally prepared.”

Since Fallon was nammed
head football coach in January,
ment is giving the football ap-
plications vis-a-vis the
February 15 deadline. “They
seem sympathetic to football’s
needs. That doesn’t mean that
standards will be lowered,”

The making of the movie
Saturday Night Fever, and its
immense success, suggest that
unexpected ideas have got a
hold on the popular imagina-
tion. I am speaking of the ideas
which have crystallized in what
we conveniently call The
Women’s Movement, and which
the film implies have filtered
down from the professional,
highly educated, “‘liberal,’’ or
otherwise privileged levels of
society, which gave them birth,
to portions of society ‘which
have for a long time seemed
unalterably hostile to them. The
values which seem to have
filtered down include the belief
that men and women can be
friends, on equal terms; the
belief that men can need
women, rather than merely
needing to master them; and
the belief that this need does not
demean men, does not somehow
make them less than “men.”’
The sexuality and the sex talk
depicted in the film are of a kind
probably intended to shock
large nembers of its audience,
and possibly they do so. That
the film also endorses many of
the values of those in the au-
dience it sets out to offend
makes it controversial on two
fronts. This double thrust is ac-
complished most notably
through the movie’s governing
metaphor— the dance.

Like Saturday Night Fever,
the widely popular recent
movies Rocky and Mean Streets
also show working class- and
street ethics to be in a state of
slow transition. In Rocky, the
hero turns away from the
classic male satisfactions of
hanging around with the
“gang” (the word is given a
more literal significance in the
other two films); he turns in-
stead toward a complex rela-
tionship with a woman as he
becomes that paradox for many
Americans, a sensitive he-man.
And the hero ofMean Streets

has finally to recognize in his

desire for a woman an impulse
more formidable than the need
for a sexual receptacle. In
Saturday Night Fever, recogni-
tions of this kind are more ex-
plicit and more central; they
are located in the fabulously ex-
citing dancing which is the
film’s major distinction. Danc-
ing becomes a metaphor for the
awareness that relations bet-
ween men and women might be
based on mutuality, rather than
on mastery and surrender, or
on superiority and inferiority.

Tony has to woo Stefanie into
dancing with him by showing an
incipient willingness to
acknowledge the (admittedly
sometimes perverse) _ re-
quirements of her being. And in
the important scene in the
dance studio in which, having
made this acknowledgement in
a minimal way, Tony begins to
teach Stefanie the steps he
wants incorporated into their
dance contest routine, he also
allows her to teach him a new
combination of steps. That is,
he consents, for a moment, to
follow her lead. They compose
the dance together.

Now when we look in any
detail at the
theme of this movie, there’s no
doubt that we run into con-
tradictions. For instance,
Tony’s first partner seems to be
a better dancer than Stefanie,
or seems, at least, to dance bet-
ter with Tony (his first dance
with her is more exciting than
his competition number with
Stefanie at the end) — and yet,
she cannot be the heroine of the
film. For one thing, she doesn’t
look like a heroine. The movie is
still sufficiently moored in con-
ventional ideas about female
sexual appeal to make it in-
evitable that its heroine be tall
and skinny, as Stefanie is.
Another reason that the first
woman is rejected as heroine is
that she isn’t ‘hard to get” — as
she tells Tony outside the dance
studio, all she has ever done to
deserve his rejection is liked
him and tried to b his friend.
Finally, it is apparently her sur-
render to several men one after
another on the back seat of a
communal car which seals her
status; the ethics of the film
still seem locked, in this
respect, in the double standard,
with its permissions to men and
its refusals to women.

Yet I doubt that the confu-
sions which surround the
presentation of this character
destroy the importance of the
new ground which is broken
elsewhere in the film. The
seriousness with which it is
prepared to treat the theme of
friendship between the sexes is
attested first by the last scene,
in which Tony asks to be friends
with Stefanie, though, touching-
ly, he’s still, even then, not sure

this is what he wants or will be
able to accept from her. The
film’s seriousness in this regard
is attested even more by its will-
ingness to let this be the last

some. At this point, the
film frustrates our expectations
in an interesting way— for we
had expected to see Tony in bed
with Stefanie some time before
the end. It is to the film’s credit
that it does not force-bloom
their affair for the sake of
romantic expectation. By not
incorporating a consummation
scene, the film asks us to accept
the premise that the new kind of
relationship toward which it
points has really not yet been
fully imagined. Neither Tony
nor Stefanie know precisely
what such a relationship would
be like, nor, it must be said, do
most of us, it is so new. The film
has the courage to content itself
with showing how difficult it is
simply to change gears.

In its yearning to forge a kind
of relationship which is foreign
to the world which Tony and
Stefanie come, the film seems
to turn its back on what it
makes Brooklyn mean. And yet,
the emphasis given to dancing
ultimately creates an ideal
which is not only impossible to
sustain in the Brooklyn sub-
culture, but which is almost
equally inimical to that part of
the Manhattan world which the
film chooses to show. Neither
Brooklyn nor Manhattan
represents a world with which
this film is happy. Instead’ it
uses dancing as a way of
“bridging” over into a world
that it wants to exist. (It is not
surprising that the bridge bet-
ween Brooklyn and Manhattan
plays so large a part in the plot
and the landscape of the
movie.) The world that the film
wants to bring into being is a
world in which the raw sexual
energy which makes Saturday
nights in Brooklyn ‘“‘feverish’’
can coexist with the more sen-
sitive and refined, but common-
ly de-sexualized world of
Manhattan’s cultured and
pseudo-cultured. We note that
when Stefanie wants to dance,
she goes back to Brooklyn. We
may legitimately question the
accuracy of this picture of
Manhattan, and the way in
which the the film sets up its

symbols, but it would be im-
poverishing to question the im-
portance of what this film seeks
to accomplish. It seeks to find a
way to bridge the old Freudian
antagonism between sexuality
and “culture,’’ to construct a

new kind of relationship bet-
ween men and women whose
radicalism might make it at
least possible to unite these
customarily splintered aspira-
tions of our lives.

Foot Loose & Fancy Free
Rod Stewart
(Warner Bros. BSK-3092)

Gee, that Rod Stewart sure
must be one wild and crazy guy.
I can just see him hoofing down
the high road to adventure,
singing those wonderfully gay
songs with as much west coast
mediocrity as he can muster.
And believe me, Bub, this
album when compared to some
of Rod’s old stuff brings new
definition to the non-sequitor
“mediocre.” What can I say?
Rod is the archetypical story of
rock ‘n’ roll gone to Hollywood.
The west coast has a sedating
effect on rock, it pulls the rough
edge out of the music and pours
the slick production and session
men in. The result is invariably
somehow to professional and
commercial, and _ therefore,
somwhat geriatric in a rock
sense.

One major problem with
Rod’s recent effort is that his
band is just too clean. Sure, the
present line-up is far superior in
technique to Stewart’s last
group, The Faces, but they lack
that lovable ineptness and
English-school-boy charm
which more than makde up for
The Faces’ lack of virtuosity.

However, there are some de-
cent tunes on Foot Loose &
Fancy Free. “Hot Legs’ and
“Born Loose” (which I am
listening to at this moment) are

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

‘Lillies that fester smell
far worse than weeds’

It is all very amusing when the SAB or Contact is criticized con-
tinually for mishandling student funds, but it becomes a very
serious matter when an organization begins to mishandle students’
rights. The way in which Student Control conducts its investiga-
tions and hearings very well may encroach upon the rights of
students.

At least one case has arisen this year involving a signed confes-
sion for a university infraction which also was a felony in the State
of Virginia. A student was compelled to sign a confession admitting
to (a) smoking marijuana, and (b) smoking marijuana in the
dorms. Such a document could be quite valuable to local police in
establishing probable cause to arrest the student for the offense.

SCC chairman Jim MeNider, acting for the committee, has tried
on at least one occasion to tape a Student Control hearing. The par-
ticular students involved in the SCC case were also involved in a
criminal case for the same offense. Their case had not yet come to
trial. The tapes, if the hearing had been recorded, possibly could
have been used in some way against them.

When a student comes in front of the E.C. for an honor violation,
he is afforded the right to confront his accusers. Not so in an SCC
hearing: at least it has not been the practice to allow the accused to
even see his accuser, must less prepare a defense.

And of course all SCC hearings are private and secret, unlike the
real world in which court cases are public.

McNider maintains the committee is only following the letter of
its constitution. The committee is efficient in doing so. This is the
basis of the whole problem. The committee, or the chairman acting
for the committee, has become efficient, but through the use of
measures that are not covered in the constitution. Nowhere in the
SCC constitution does it say written confessions are to be secured.
Nowhere does it say the hearings are to be recorded. Nowhere does
it say the accused cannot face his accuser, and nowhere does it say
that the results of the proceedings are to be kept secret. But it also
must be mentioned that neither does the constitution say the com-
mittee cannot use written confessions or tape recordings or that it
should make the results of the proceedings public. Nowhere is it
written that the accused should be allowed to prepare a defense.
Maybe it should be. It seems our basic rights can no longer be
assumed.

In its attempt to do a good job, the SCC has become over zealous
in the way it goes about doing it. The SCC should be congratulated
for being efficient and doing all it can to find out everything about a
case. Just pray you never have to appear before Student Control.

If you do, you will meet the chairman. The chairman will conduct
the whole investigation himself. The constitution says he can. He
will prepare the case against you. The constitution says he can.
Then, if he is feeling really energetic, he may even decide on his
own whether or not the SCC should even hear your case or if it
should go to the E.C. The constitution says a majority of the SCC
must decide to hear the case. If the accused suspects he has not
received fair treatment, he can appeal the SCC penalty to the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. There he will confront the SCC chairman
again. This time the chairman has a vote. Perhaps the chairman’s
position assumes too many responsibilities.

The SCC constitution needs to be rewritten so as to afford the
Washington and Lee student his basic rights. It should be specified
how the SCC should regard possible criminal infractions. It should
particularize what rights the accused has. The White Book does
this. Finally, since the SCC deals with cases that are not honor of-
fenses, the results, excluding names of defendants, should be made
a matter of public record. Not only would this inform the W&L
community of SCC treatment of certain offenses, but it would also
open the SCC to constructive criticism from the public whom it is
supposed to be serving.

they would all be smart ugly

McNider responds

Dear Editor:

In response to your vaguely
accusatory and_ grossly
misleading article of February
2, the Student Control Commit-
tee would like to unequivocably
assert that we have precisely
followed those procedures
detailed in our ‘Statement of
Purposes and Procedures.”

Regarding our position as to
Student Control cases which in-
volve possible honor violations,
the Committee will continue to

allow the EC to exercise its
jurisdiction these matters.

In the future, if there is any
question about our procedural
fidelity, I suggest that you come
directly to the Committee in-
stead of irresponsibly relying
on “sources” which have no
connection whatsoever with our
organization.

Respectfully,

Jim McNider

The quote from a faculty

The faculty member actually
said the number of applications

Due to our sporting natures and to the
fact that we refused to usea dictionary and
thus could not find any word in any
language to fit 21 and 25 down, we have
generously provided you with the respec-
tive answers. If ‘figrae’’ and “oepcl” exist
in any tongue, we'd like to know about it.

We hope you find this puzzle a challenge,
and with only twelve blackened areas and

some “interesting” clues, you should.

innovative ideas, only time
could prove him right.

ODK was a second great
W&L innovation. It was found-
ed on December 3, 1914. The
idea originated with two college
roommates: J. Carl Fisher and
Ruppert N. Latture. Their idea,
expanded and matured with the
aid of the inspirational tradi-
tions and idealism of Robert E.
Lee and George Washington,
was to bring together leaders in
all phases of University life.
Rather than remaining
ensconced in the stagnate rela-
tionships typical of students and
professors, ODK wanted to br-
ing outstanding students and in-
Structors together in an at-
mosphere based on common in-
terest, understanding and
helpfulness.

An official publication of ODK
at the time said, ‘ODK’s
recognition of an individual by
electing him to membership im-
poses upon him far greater
citizen responsibilities than he
has ever had before. In the final
analysis, however, the com-
pleteness of the ODK idea
comes with the realization that
the greater obligation to serve
is the price of ability.”

The ODK idea. must have
been ripe for its time, as the
society quickly added circles at
Johns Hopkins and the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. There are
now more than 110 circles in col-
leges and universities
throughout the country. One of
the founders’ Professor
Emeritus Rupert Latture, now
85, is still active in W&L affairs
and has ‘an office adjacent to
President Robert Huntley’s.

The first curveball pitcher?
W&L claims that'honor, too’
although it is not well
documented. According to Bill
Washburn in the Alumni Office,
a man by the name of George A.
Sykes, class of 1869, was the na-
tion’s first curveballer. He said
there was a write-up on it in the
Lexington Gazette in which the
reporter said Sykes did ‘‘a scur-
vy thing by throwing a curvey
ball.” Washburn said the first
catcher of a curve ball was
William M. McElwee. Both
McElwee’s and Sykes, portraits
are in the Alumni House.
Washburn said McElwee went
on to become president of Peo-
ple’s Bank, now the First Na-
tional Exchange Bank.

Kappa Alpha was another
W&L first. It was established
on Dec. 21, 1865 by four W&L
students. A plaque now stands

The four students who started
KA were: William Nelson Scott,
Stanhope McClellan Scott,
James Ward Wood and William
Archibald Walsh. According to
KA member Russell Parmly,
KA was originally known as Phi
Kappa Chi but, because there
was already a Phi Kappa Psi,
the originators decided to
change the name. Robert E.
Lee is the spiritual founder of
KA, Parmly said. Its official
philosophy is to act as Christian
knights dedicated to the highest
ideals of character and achieve-
ment, Parmly added.

Robert E. Lee was the
spiritual instigator of most of
the W&L firsts. W&L has tried
to live up to his standards of
honor and. integrity since then
and-has seen no reason to
undergo the radical changes re-

something as symbolic and
complex as Eben’s fixation for
the farm, nor so apparently
self-effacing. (He wants the
farm for his mother.)

Chester does a fine job with
this most difficult task. I find it
hard to say how or why, but
perhaps this is a tribute to the

seamless nature of. his
characterization, stretched bet-
ween these two extremes.

Jim Weatherstone presents
us with a wonderfully am-
bigious Ephraim Cabot. From
his first entrance with his new
wife, Abbie, he establishes
himself as the ruler, imposing
himself upon the state. O’Neill
and Weatherstone take us on a
bit of a roller coaster ride with
this character, for he is at one
time dominant and failing. He
would drive Eben off the farm
when he learns of the affair bet-
ween him and Abbie, yet he can
muster only a crazed little look
when he learns that the baby,
accredited falsely to him, is
dead. But, this ambiguity is a
vital part of Ephraim. He’s a

lonely man, meant to be alone.

None of his three wives have

been able to share in the world.

he inhabits.

Ellen Jervey’s Abbie is pro-
bably the most difficult of all
these complex characters, as
far as portrayal goes. For it is
finally through her, that we are
able to see some growth in the
ability to share one life with
another. And it is the various
schemes and strings pulled by
Abbie which make the play go,
as she forces her way into the
world of both Ephraim and
Eben. The great danger with
Abbie is to ‘‘lose’’ her at one of
the mid-points, before she
reaches the final state of
unselfish love for Eben.

Homemade Soup

Although this realization in Ab-
bie could have been made more
clear, Jervey handles the
modulation necessary for a suc-
cessful Abbie quite well.

Hunt Brown and Jeff Bun-
trock should also be commend-
ed on their jobs as the two older
brothers of Eben, Simeon and
Peter. They exist to counter-
point Eben early in the play, in
order to show his limited verbal
powers and his dreams about
the farm.

Turning for a moment to the
technical side of the ledger,
there is only one observation to
make. Again Tom Ziegler has
come through in a_ pinch,

designing the cracker-box
Troubadour into submission
with the director’s ideas.

In fact, there is but one
adverse remark that can be
said for this production of
Desire Under the Elms. And
that is those blasted musical
blackouts... In several places,
the lively bluegrass just didn’t
fit, and in general the music’s
happy sound pulled the au-
dience off course and tended to
destroy the emotional tension of
the play itself.
