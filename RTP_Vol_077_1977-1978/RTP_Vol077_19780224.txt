At the time of this printing,
work is in its final stages for the
7lst annual Fancy Dress Ball,
announced Art Dunnan, Co-
Ordinator of this year’s event.

The doors of the student
center complex will open at 8:30
p.m. tonight for the black-tie
dance. Important! There will be
two entrances this year, to
eliminate the long lines that oc-
curred previously. Faifax
Lounge will no longer be used as
the entrance room; instead,
students and faculty should
form lines outside the two ante-
rooms of Evans Dining Hall,
both fronting on Washington
Street.

It is already common

VOLUME LXXVII

by Jim Barnes

Rocked by scandal from the
outset to the conclusion of his
tenure as SAB co-chairman,
Charlie Hulfish still .remains a
controversial person after.his
conviction of an honor offense
by the Executive Committee
two weeks ago.

The first controversy came
early this academic year when
the Ring-tumPhi reported that

upon the Duke Ellington Or-
chestra, but several other at-
tractions have been contracted
by the SAB and will be on hand
throughout the night, starting at
8:30. Of special interest will be

‘tthe appearance of ‘‘Jameela,”

a professional belly-dancer, in
the Cockpit. In the EC room,
George Fischoff, a jazz pianist,
will be performing. Mr.
Fischoff is a familiar face to
many W&L students, having
appeared here before as part of
the Cockpit Coffeehouse circuit.

In keeping with the mystical
Egyptian theme, the SAB has
also arranged for presentations
by John-Ivan Palmer. Palmer,
a “‘mentalist” and expert in the
area of extra-sensory percep-
tion, will perform in the televi-
sion lounges on the second level

Hulfish acquired a nointerest
loan. E.C. votes rallied around
Hulfish and he remained SAB
co-chairman--for a while. Look-
ing back to September, senior
EC representative Mike Missal
commented, ‘‘We should have
kicked him out (off of the SAB)
then.” SAB members said
outright, “‘Nobody trusted him
with money or tickets.’’ Hulfish
admitted as much to the Ring-

of the Student Center.

Movies will be shown con-
tinually in Room 114, next to the
television rooms. Among the
titles are such Egyptian treats
as “The Mummy’s Tomb,”
“Abbott and Costello in the
Foreign Legion,’ Bugs Bunny
starring in ‘‘Ali Baba Bunny,”
and more.

Pictures of you and your date
will be available from Andre’
Studios, whose representative
will be set up in the Student
Center library. For $6.50, one
can purchase 4 wallet photos,
and two larger prints.

terest — The rumor is true that
the first Egyptian sight visible
as one approaches the ball, will

And finally, a_ historic
note...Many have asked who the
founder of the Fancy Dress Ball
was: the best answer is to refer
them to a large portrait in the
reference room of McCormick
Library. It is a likeness of Miss
Annie Jo White, a Washington
and Lee librarian. She founded
the ball in 1907 as a private mas-
querade party (not your
stereotyped “dull” librarian,
was Miss White). The event
gained popularity by leaps and
bounds, and by 1913, it was an
established tradition for the en-
tire campus. (McCormick

Student Control actions
questioned by EC members

by Randy Smith

The powers, procedures, and
operation of the Student Control
Committee came under close
scrutiny during a long and
painstaking Executive Commit-
tee meeting Monday night. (The
SCC handles cases of student
misconduct and is composed of
thepresident and vice-president
of each academic class and law
school representatives. )

Most of the EC’s questions
concerned the standard Student
Control procedure of con-
ducting a preliminary in-
vestigation of a reported inci-
dent before the case is con-
sidered by the full committee.
Questions also arose about the
SCC’s ‘‘STatement on the Pur-
pose and Procedures of the Stu-
dent Control Committee,’’ and
the rights of persons brought
before the committee for acts of
misconduct.

Jim MeNider, chairman of
the Student Control Committee,
explained the need for a
preliminary investigation as a
clarification of the cir-
cumstances involved in the
case. Information is gathered
by the investigator — who is
often McNider — to determine
the nature of the case for

 

presentation to the committee.
E.C. law representatives
Jackie Boyden and Tom Healy
raised many questions about
the need for a preliminary in-
vestigation of a student miscon-
duct case. Healy argued that
the process of discovering the
circumstances of a case during
a preliminary investigation is
exactly what happens when the
full committee hears the case,
thereby making the
preliminary investigation un-

necessary. —

McNider explained that a
preliminary investigation helps
determine ‘‘the nature of the
problem,”’ and also provides a
“‘framework’’ for questions.
‘“‘Convening the committee is a
great logistical problem,”’
MeNider said, “‘we need all the
facts before us.”’

He also explained that a
preliminary investigation

determines if a case will be

An SAB member recently in-
quired, “In that last Fancy
Dress article, you mentioned
the ‘figrue! What exactly is
that?” The Washington Post,
in one of its last articles on the
traditional ball in the 1960’s,
said this: ‘‘The balls centered
on the ‘figure,’ a cotillion-like
dance in which the couples
formed the shape of the univer-
sity’s crest, a four-sectioned
blue, red and yellow shield with
a noble bird and a bottom rib-
bon on which is inscribed ‘Non
In Cautus Futuri,’ The universi-
ty motto meaning ‘Not unmind-
ful of the Future.’ ‘‘ Am-

SAB removes member

by Galen Trussell

The Student Activities Board
voted to remove a member
from the board, and add a new
member at a meeting held Sun-
day night.

The Board voted unanimously
to add Bill Ridge as a new
member at large. SAB
Chairmen Bill Tucker’ said
Ridge should have been on the
board a lot earlier because of
the work he has been doing.
Tucker said he had been in-
formed by Jim Underhill and
other members of the EC that it
was within his power to add or
remove members from the
board. Tucker said he thought it
would be better if the whole
board voted on the matter.

The SAB also voted to remove
Glen Stanford as member-at-
large and film comittee co-
chairman, According to Bill
Tucker, the committee decided
that Stanford’s performance
wasn’t up to par. The remaining
film committee chairman,
Steve Mangan said Stanford
was unavailable to correct
minor problems with films and
that he was not doing the work.

In other action, the board
decided not to schedule a con-
cert in March. The board had
earlier decided to attempt to
contact the Outlaws and
Sealevel for a March 17 date,

‘and Firefall for an April date.

Law students propose

Honor Code revisions

Reprinted with permission of
W&L Law News
by John F. Allevato

A subcommittee of the Stu-
dent Bar Association Board of
Governors, appointed to draw
up various reform proposals for
the Honor Code tentatively has
submitted a list of possible
reforms that will be acted upon
by the SBA Board of Governors
as soon as possible.

William Garrett, first year
class president and a member
of the committee, emphasized
that the proposals are intended
to strengthen the present
system, and that the subcom-
mittee, after receiving input
from other law students, is not
advocating the creation of
separate honor systems for the
law school and_ the
undergraduates.

The proposals center upon
more clearly defining the limit
and scope of the Honor Code,
and upon precedural reforms.

Among the various proposals
included in the subcommittee’s
report is strict limitations of
honor code violations to those
involving lying, cheating, and
stealing. According to Garrett,
the activities which could
violate the Honor Code at this
time are vague and need
greater definition.

Another proposal would limit
geographic jurisdiction of the
Honor System to areas where a
W&L_ student’ srepresents
himself as a W&L student, and
someone relies upon that
representation. Additionally,
Rockbridge County would serve
as a quasi-boundary for viola-
tions. At this time, there is no
limit on the jurisdiction of the

Food co-op
takes stride

Jerry Darrell, manager of all
three W&L food services, will
hold a meeting on “kitchen
management” next week — the
first toward a fraternity food
cooperative.

Darrell announced the ses-
sion at this week’s IF.C.
meeting. He said that the pur-
pose of the management session
was to ‘“‘see what we need to do”’
before setting-up a food co-op.
In future weeks, Darrell plans
to have problem solving
‘“‘workshops’’ to help fraternity
food managers perform their
duties more efficiently.

‘IT don’t have time to help run
a food co-op’”’ Darrell said. But
he will help food managers set-
up the framework.

Waste is the problem Darrell
considers most important. He
said that currently, most food
managers do not keep the
necessary paperwork their job
requires. “You have to know
what you’re buying, keep
records on quantity, so that you
know what you need,” Darrell
emphasized.

The kitchen management ses-
sion will be held in a meeting
room along the side of Evans
Dining Hall this Wednesday at 4
p.m. Anyone interested is in-
vited to attend.

honor system.

The subcommittee also has
recommended that the three EC
members who investigate the
reported violation not be allow-
ed to vote on the guilt or in-
nocence of the accused, and
that of the three investigators of
the EC, one of them must be
from the school of the accused
(i.e. Commerce School, Law
School, etc.)

At the closed EChearing, the
only person allowed to speak on
his own behalf is the accused.
The subcommittee would like to
see that changed to allow the
accused’s advisors a chance to
question witnesses and to speak
for him. The SBA committee
felt, however, that only the ac-
cused should make the final
statement on his behalf.

Additionally, the subcom-
mittee would like to see
graduated penalties instead of
the single sanction available
now. At the option of the EC, the
subcommittee’s report says an
accused found guilty could be
permitted to reapply for admis-
sion after a designated time of
dismissal.

Another proposal would
remove all notations from a
guilty student’s school records”’

 

 

he record, thus, would state
only in a public trial, his record
is noted that the student was
asked to leave because of an
honor violation.

Other proposals would re-
quire a three-quarter’s vote (it
is now two-thirds) for convic-
tion by the EC and the student
jury; that an accused by told
the names of his accusers, or
that he be told their names and
a chance to interview them;
and that the language in the
Honor Code be made more
‘“‘neuter.”’

The subcommittee would also
like to see a third law school EC
representative so that each
class has their own represen-

Overwhelming vote

IFC usurps Contact receptions

Steve Mattesky, president of
the Interfraternity Council,
oversaw the overwhelming ap-
proval of a motion for the I.F.C.
to select the fraternity houses
holding cocktail parties before
a Contact lecture.

Mattesky introduced the mo-
tion at the end of Tuesday’s
I.F.C. meeting to ensure the
fairness of the cocktail party
selection procedure. The mo-
tion was adopted unanimously.
(The I.F.C. helped found the
Contact Committee and
regularly contributes at least a
third of Contact’s expense
money.)

Earlier in the meeting, the
Fraternity Inspection commit-
tee handed out newly compiled

monthly checklists of safety re-

I.F.C. will monitor the lists of
items ‘‘which should be attend-
ed to on a frequent basis.”’

The Inspection Committee
will make an inspection in about
two weeks, and hope to have a
report on the condition of each
house by the end of March.

Dr. Thomas Imeson, chair-
man of the Fraternity Inspec-
tion Committee, told the I.F.C.
that during an inspection his
committee has great reluctance
to enter fraternity residents,
rooms. ‘‘We try to make it a
policy not to go into an in-

said.

March concert out
SAB removes Stanford,

instates new member

“If the SAB were operating
under last year’s procedures, it
would have already had acts
lined up for the March event,”’
Tucker said. He added, ‘‘Offers
came over the break, but the
board couldn’t decide on them,
so we couldn’t reply to the of-
fers.”

Tucker was refering to an EC
decision which made it man-
ditory that the entire SAB vote
on which band to contact for
concerts.

Tucker added he thought it
was important that SAB not
pool all its resources for one big
concert in the Spring. He said
one big concert tends to alienate
some people, while more little
ones touch base with
everybody.

Tucker emphasized that the
board would be deciding next
week what kind of entertain-
ment should be scheduled bet-
ween Fancy Dress and the Spr-
ing term.

 

Culture counselor
Husson here on 4th

Roland Husson, deputy
cultural counselor to the French
Embassy in Washington, D.C.,
will be at Washington and Lee
Unviersity March 3 in conjunc-
tion with the opening of the ex-
hibition ‘French Cathedrals”
in the duPont Gallery.

“French Cathedrals’ is a
photographic essay on the
development of French
medieval architecture.

Husson will deliver a slide
lecture on “Paris Tomorrow’”’
in the duPont auditorium at 8
p.m. He will focus on the highly
controversial Centre Pom-
pidou, a Parisian example of
ultra-modern architecture
which functions as a center of
‘living art.”’

galJeries and work spaces free
of obstructions.

Modernists praise the
building while traditionalists
say it destroys the harmony
that exists among the buildings
where it is located, one of the
oldest sections of Paris.

Husson says his choice of a
topic is in keeping with the
W&L exhibition on Gothic ar-
chitecture which was called, in
its time, ‘‘the modern style.”’

Husson was born and
educated in Paris. He has been
professor of French literature
in France, Australia and the
United States. He has also been
French cultural attache in San-
tiago, Chile and San Francisco.

The gallery is open to the
public from 9 to 5 on weekdays.

 
Frats need legal eagles

part 4 of a series
"by Randy Smith

When other, more subtle
methods of persuasion fail,
fraternities do have a legal
alternative they can employ to
secure payment of members’
unpaid bills.

Eric L. Sisler, a Lexington at-
torney retained by Washington
and Lee University for legal
counsel, outlined various legal
actions fraternities might con-
sider for the collection of debts
incurred by fraternity
members.

The issuance of a debt war-
rant was Sisler’s strongest
recommendation. Collection on
a debt warrant is similar to a
petition filed in small claims
court.

A verbal contractural agree-
ment is the most common prac-
tice for the billing of members
by fraternities. Attorney Sisler
said that a verbal contract is as
valid as a written contract in
Virginia, but the debt warrant
must be filed within three years
after the debt was incurred.

The fraternity’s treasurer or
any officer of the fraternity can
be designated to file a debt war-
rant (costing $5.50), and to pro-
ve to the judge that the in-
dividual has debts outstanding.
The sheriff then serves the war-
rant on the debtor with a sum-
mons to appear in court for pay-
ment of the debt.

Once a judgement is made
against the debtor in court, his
credit rating suffers, which
possibly hinders later attempts
to secure a loan or obtain other
credit financing.

If immediate funds to settle
the debt are still lacking at trial
time, the court can seize per-
sonal property or garnish the
debtor’s wages to ensure pay-
ment of the debt. Attorney
Sisler noted that the court does
not recognize special treatment
for “hardship cases” (persons

Phi Beta Kappa

Matthai

honored

William H. Matthai, a student
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, has reeeived the Phi Beta
Kappa Sophomore Award.

The award, given annually by
the Washington and Lee
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa,
goes to the sophomore with the
highest grade-point average
through the fall term of his se-
cond year. He receives books
valued up to $25.

Matthai is the son of Mr. and
Mrs. William H. Matthai of 212
Tunbridge, Rd., Baltimore. He
attended the Gilman School.

At Washington and Lee, Mat-
thai is a member of the
honorary scholastic fraternity
Phi Eta Sigma and the social
fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. He is
also a member of the College
Republications and is active in
the University Theater.

from a financially disadvantag-
ed background).

However, Sisler did not that if
the person issued a debt war-
rant pays his bills before the
trial date, there would be no tar-
nish on his personal record
because there had not been a
court judgement.

In the case of graduates who
have left W&L and the state of
Virginia, Sisler said that the
debt claim is still valid, but
must be pursued in the state
where the defendent now lives.

As an alternative settlement
of unpaid bills, counsel Sisler
said a promissory note could be
used to guarantee payment of
large outstanding debts. A pro-
missory note is a written agree-
ment between the debtor and
creditor for payment of the debt
on terms agreed upon by the
two. They are inexpensive and
legally binding. Copies of both
‘demand’ and “‘time’’ pro-
missory notes are in Dean Mur-
phy’s office.

Sisler suggested that to help
curtail bill collection problems,
fraternities set ‘‘a maximum
credit limit’’ for all members at
the beginning of the year.
Failure to keep under the credit
limit might result in the loss of

house privileges or other
similar punitive action, Sisler
offered.

He also recommended that
fraternities collect a ‘‘deposit’’
from each member to make
people “more attentive to their
bills.”” The deposit money could
also be used as a reserve fund to
cover somé short-term ex-
penses.

The attorney’s third sugges-
tion was to obtain a parental
guarantee of their son’s debts.

‘‘Fraternities are a
business,’”’ Sisler said. ‘Your
house can’t function if you have
financially irresponsible people
burdening the other members
with their debts.”

Hulfish has remained in the
public eye as a result of his
business activites on campus.
He has been selling Fancy
Dress t-shirts for almost two
weeks in the Student Center lob-
by and later in the Co-op. It
seems as though Hulfish ap-
proached the SAB with a pro-
posal to sell Fancy Dress t-
shirts. At that time what the
SAB did not know, was that they
had already been ordered by
Hulfish. According to one SAB
member ‘“‘he (Hulfish) said that
they had already been
ordered.”’ The SAB decided to
reject Hulfish’s proposal
anyway. This left Hulfish with a
sizable investment on_ his
hands. Hulfish remained on
campus to sell the t-shirts.
Missal said, ‘I have seen
Charlie up in the SAB office fre-
quently using the telephone.”

Hulfish began selling the t-
shirts two weeks ago, the day
after he was convicted by the

E.C.

Hulfish told Jerry Darrell
Wednesday that he could no
longer sell the t-shirts in the
Student Center because Mike
Cappeto, chairman of the Stu-
dent Center, said the facility
was getting too crowded with
the SAB decorators for Hulfish
to continue selling the t-shirts
there.

However, the Ring-tum-Phi
has learned that Wednesday
morning Cappeto received a
call from Dean of Students
Lewis John expressing his con-
cern:.over business ventures
conducted in the Student Center
by non-University personnel.

Darrell said he approved
Hulfish’s request to sell the t-
shirts in the Co-op because, as
Darrell put it, “I felt that if this
was something that the students
wanted, then I’d let him sell
them in the Co-op. But once
Darrell was informed of the in-

tentions of some of the E.C.
members to seek his expulsion
from campus, he agreed to go
along with whatever the E.C.
decide.

Wednesday morning Missal
confronted Hulfish in the Co-op
and told him to leave campus.
According to Missal Hulfish
said he wouldn’t move unless
“somebody like Dean John tells
me to.’’ When Missal informed
Hulfish that he would not be
able to attend fancy dress,
Missal said Hulfish replied,
“Bullshit. I’m going anyways,
and I’m going to have fun.”’

Missal went to Dean John for
assistance in resolving the
issue. Missal said, ‘Dean John
told him to get off campus.”
Missal also added that Dean
John made it clear to Hulfish
that he wouldn’t be able to at-
tend fancy dress. John would
neither confirm or deny
Missal’s story. John said, “I
don’t feel that I should com-
ment on _ individual honor
cases.’’ However, John did say,
“TI will work with the Executive
Committee to help enforce the
policies of the E.C.”

Missal told the Ring-tum-Phi
that the E.C. should have acted
sooner to see that Hulfish was
removed from campus. Missal
said “It should have been
brought up at 'Monday’s
meeting. The whole concept of
the honor code is that if a person
is dishonorable, we don’t want
him in the community.”

Missal saw Dean John Thurs-

day morning to thank him for

the assistance he rendered. But
when Missal was informed by
theRing-tum-Phi that Hulfish
was in the Co-op Thursdav
afternoon around 3:00 p.m., he
was quite distressed. At the
time thePhi was going to press,
Missal was going to try to see
John to discuss Hulfish’s conti-
nuing pressence on campus.

Few colleges have a national-
ly rated swimmer, John Hud-
son. Fewer still have a Rhodes
Scholar, Mark Bradley. Even
fewer have both a John Hudson
and a Mark Bradley. But only
W&L has a John Hudson, a
Mark Bradley, and a Penn
Plummer. Whoa! — wait a
minute; who, or what, is a Penn
Plummer? The _ red-headed
native of East Liverpool, Ohio,
filled with tough words, eccen-

more for its ironclad con-

of individualistic thinkers), in

So he’s an eccentric preppy;
what’s the big deal? After all,
Lexington has more than its fair

normal people. But only Penn
Plummer has the unearned

senior year with Phi Beta

double major in European
History and German, and Phi
Beta Kappa and not being
allowed to graduate for not
fulfilling his phys. ed. obliga-
tion.

The details of Plummer’s
plight seems to weigh in his
favor. Evidently, Penn fell vic-
tim to varicose veins in his
junior year, along with further
complications, which complete-
ly debilitated him. This medical
impairment precluded Plum-
mer from taking any more gym
classes or from participating
actively in the ROTC program.
On April 2, 1977, the ROTC
department honorably
discharged their scholar for
medical reasons, (undaunted
by the adversity of the situa-
tion, however, Plummer plans
to enlist after this year).

But, according to Plummer,
Dr. Frederick A. Feddeman
and Assistant Athletic Director,
Dick Miller, denied the con-
valescing senior his diploma for
supposedly trying to skirt his
physical education require-
ment. But when a dismayed

 

‘‘Some people consider me a fascist. I find that association per-
sonally repugnant as it tends to identify me with the dirty, sweaty

Plummer tried to explain the
obvious physical impediments
to his taking Badmitton 101 and
other enlightening courses, his
pleas fell on deaf ears. Miller
responded by telling Plummer
that he should have taken all his
phys. ed. courses in his
freshman and sophomore
years.

By combining good sport-
smanship with sarcasm, Plum-
mer now says, ‘‘As far as my
personal relations with Dick
Miller are concerned, I regard
Dick Miller as a saint; and the
sooner he’s sainted, the better
I'll feel.”” But, as the perpetual
student, the Castro look-alike
feels he has learned something
from this ordeal. “This ex-
perience has done much to
erode my faith in an ad-
ministrator or a doctor merely
because of his position. In the
future, such a man would have
to personally inspire confidence
in me to gain my trust.”

But being a Phi Beta Kap-
pa/Doremus carryover is only
half of the Penn Plummer

story. During his four plus’

years in Lexington, he has
found himself emboiled in rag-
ing controversy and surrounded

by gnawing and undying:

rumors. The one controversy
more than any other that
brought Plummer campus-wide
notoriety was his mysterious
minimization of ties with Sigma
Phi Epsilon following an inci-
dent involving the house

brothers of Phi Gamma Delta.
The story behind the controver-
sy pits a loaded gun-toting
Plummer threatening two in-
nocently tipsy FIJIs upon insuf-
ficient provocation and subse-
quently wildly chasing the two
into the street. Following the
assumed near-tragedy, Plum-
mer was more or less forced to
leave SPE.

But Penn has his side to the
story. First he says concerning
the incident itself, “I never
drew a loaded gun on anyone
during my stay at Sigma Phi
Epsilon nor did I ever chase
anybody with a loaded gun. I
have, however, reacted as I
thought appropriate to main-
tain my personal security.”
Plummer elaborates on his
following withdrawal from
SPE. ‘‘My self-imposed exile
from Sigma Phi Epsilon was a
culmination of a process that
had been going on for about two
years. I identified myself with
the OLD GUARD of the frater-
nity and with their absence, I
found very little incentive to
stay in the fraternity. My in-
bred distaste for political fac-
tionism and Roberts Rules of
Order were important factors in
this decision also.”’

Whether the widely-accepted
version or the Plummer version
of the incident held true or
whether the SPE exile was forc-
ed or voluntary, Penn is now en-
joying his status as a social
member in Zeta Beta Tau,

Plummer: if unique is what you seek...

which he says is “very open
minded, tolerant, and lots of
fun.”” His personal feelings
toward SPE today have been
ameliorated because of recent
trends and events within the
house itself. ‘‘I understand that
some of the conditions which I
found intolerable have now im-
proved considerably. I am
pleased that the future looks
brighter for the Virginia Ep-
silon chapter.”’

Plummer has always been a
forthright and stubborn conser-
vative. The needs of rightist
thinking which parental
breeding planted in Plummer’s
mind sprouted at Choate,
(where he despised the pseudo-
doctrine of ‘revolution for the
hell of it’), matured at home,
and grew to fruition at
Washington and Lee. This
Milton Friedman attitude of
“There ain’t no free lunch,”
buttressed by his strong
militaristic tendencies have
spawned not so gracious
rumors about Plummer, his
views and his character. In
response to a recent rumor, uni-
que to Washington and Lee,
identifying Penn as the campus
fascist, Plummer, seizing upon
a rather snooty attitude,
retorts, “One of my great
regrets at being labeled ‘Cam-

 

= ‘Anything can happen in America.”

 

pus Fascist’ is that it identifies
me with the grubby, sweaty
masses. I find the association
repugnant.”

But another’ spurious
longstanding rumor, leaving no
room for levity, tags Plummer
as a Nazi both in his character
and in his political views. Since
his days at Choate, Plummer
has been alleged of being
everything from a closet Nazi to
an owner of a bar of soap pro-
duced in Warsaw in 1942. He has
consistently denied all of these
assertions. (For example to
prove his aversion to being a
closet Nazi, Plummer, using his
most effective weapon, his mor-
dent wit, has hung flags of the
Third Reich in his closet).

Yet the ugly rumors persist.
Plummer angers over his sup-
posed link to Nazism because
that philosophy contradicts
directly with his “distaste for
national socialism, fear of mass
uprisings in general, and a
hatred of demogogues.”’ Fur-
thermore Plummer contends
that ‘“‘Nazism was Hitlerism
and centered around the cult of
the leader figure.” To combat
two aspects of his much malign-
ed reputation, the soap rumor
and his alleged pro-Hitler and
totalitarian sentiments, Plum-

Hints to help

 

 

Reading problems

About 85 percent of the work
you do as a college student in-
volves reading. It is the single
most important learning skill,
and yet many students are bog-
ged down in poor reading habits
that can make studying a chore.

Reading is the visual ability
to understand words and their
relationship one to another. To
improve reading skills you
must increase your capacity to
see and grasp the grouping of
words, or ideas, at a speed that
is comfortable for you. The key
is to move your eyes at a rate
that allows your prain to absorb
the main ideas printed on a
page.

Remember, your eyes, like
fingers for the piano or legs for
jogging, must be trained to be
skillful. If you would like to tune
up your reading skills, these
basic steps will help.

STEP 1—EVALUATE YOUR
READING HABITS

Do you vocalize words in your
mind, or move your lips as you
read? You may be using the
childhood habit of sounding out
each word. This slows you
down.

Do strange words constantly
stop your’ progress? Your

vocabulary needs improving.

Do you read every single
word separately? Train your
eyes to span phrases and to
group thoughts units together.

Do you have to back up and
reread very often? You are not
paying attention. Force
yourself to concentrate.

Do you read everything at the
same speed? Your speed should
vary with the subject matter.

Are you reading faster now
than when you were in high
school? Skillful reading is an
art and needs continual prac-
tice.

STEP 2—PROVIDE THE
RIGHT ATMOSPHERE

To read effectively, you need
to set the scene for concentra-
tion. Pick a quiet place where
you-can read with a minimum
of interruption. Have a pencil
ready for taking notes.

Most individuals find that 15

inches away from their eyes is a
comfortable distance to hold a
book. Make sure the lighting is
good.
Radio, television, and music,
all pull your attention away
from the words and ideas you
are readying.

Ring-tum Phi, Feb. 24, 1978, Page 5

The quotable Plummer

(continued from page 4)

mer reflects that genocide was
“a manifestation of Hitler’s
personality” and adds, “Any
system that tends to regard peo-
ple as a mass, as a monolithic
block and which has as its goal
the general leveling of people
within that society I find abhor-
rent. I believe in liberty before
equality. I would like to say that
I adhere to what I believe to be
the principles of those men who
framed the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights.”’ Concluding that
the difficulties of his reputation
bear no solution, Plummer, in
an interesting blend of resigna-
tion and self-reliance, says,
“There are people who,
regardless of what I say, regard
me as a Nazi and continue to
think of me as a reincarnation
of Hitler. I can do very little to
change their minds about me. I
regard their actions toward me,
motivated by this Hitlerite im-
age, as I would regard an infant
of six months soiling his diaper
while I hold him; it is regret-
table and unpleasant, but, as
there is nothing I can do about
it, I don’t let it bother me.”’
Looking back over his years
at Washington and Lee, Plum-
mer feels he has_ gotten
everything he asked for and
more. His reflections on various
aspects of W&L life portray
either a hardening cynicism or
an ongoing faith in tradi-
tionalism. Commenting on the
Honor Code, Plummer quips, ‘‘I
like the idea of the Honor Code;
I wish it worked.’’ Plummer
blasts ‘preppies,’ (in the W&L
context), by postulating, ‘I
think there is a distorted image
of what a W&L man should be.
The fact that this image is self
perpetuating does not, in my
opinion, make it either ap-

Library
Construction

Ahead

Construction is ahead of
schedule on Washington and
Lee University’s new $9.26-
million undergraduate library
building, and the university now
expects to move into it during
the Christmas holiday in
December this year. The
130,000-Square-foot building is
located directly behind
Washington Hall on the main
W&L campus and will have a
capacity of 500,000 volumes and
individual study space for 800
students. Plans call for the
eventual remodeling of McCor-
mick Hall, the current library
building, to become the new
home of W&L’s School of Com-
merce, Economics and Politics
after the library moves into its
new facility and when funds for
the renovation become
available. In turn, Newcomb
Hall, currently the home of the
commerce school, will be
remodeled to provide needed
expansion room for The Col-
lege, W&L’s arts-and-sciences
division.

propriate or desirable. 1 refer,
of course, to that  khaki-
trousered preppiedom whose
major attributes seem to be
clannishness, academic
mediocrity, a highly pressured
social life, and a taste in music
requiring cloth ears.”

In response to a question for
his opinion on the recent
disclosure in the RtP about a
preferential admissions policy
toward Lexingtonian and black
applicants, Plummer com-
ments, “‘As I am a believer in
the maintenance of tradition,
the only possible condition
where I would condone
preferential treatment of an ap-
plicant, where there were two
applicants of equal merit and
one being the son of an alum-
nus, would be the choosing of
the son of an alumnus.” On a
positive note, Penn feels that
the Ring-tum Phi is fine as long
as it keeps him informed and in-
terested. But the departing fifth
year student hastens to add that
he misses the column ‘Ask
Traveller.’

Plummer’s response to the
recent RtP co-ed/social life
poll is realistic on the one hand

and strangely ambiguous on the
other. Concerning the W&L
social life, Penn calmly states
that, “‘There are ample op-
portunities to achieve social
prowess. It take an effort on the
part of the individual.” But
when queried on his feelings
toward co-education, Plum-
mer’s reaction is a fit of un-
controllable laughter; enough
to drive any interviewer to end,
(as I did with great speed and
little dexterity), the discussion
instantly.

So William Penn Plummer, a
Phi Beta Kappa confined to
Washington and Lee (due to an
athletic program which ‘did
not influence’ his decision to
come here “‘one iota’’) for an
additional year; caught in an in-
excapable predicament of prin-
ciples versus peer acceptance,
will take with him when he
graduates this spring, his
idiosyncracies, his sometimes
biting sense of humor, and.
most importantly, a visible ele-
ment of diversity that makes
Washington and Lee that much
more of an interesting and
broadening experience.

There is life after
college for ’77

by Paul Daugherty

There is life after college.

According to a report on the
class of 1977, issued earlier this
month by Mike Cappeto, direc-
tor of career development and
placement for the university,
more than 37 percent of last
year’s seniors entered graduate
and professional schools last
fall. The remaining graduates
entered directly into the job
market.

The report is based on a

survey sent last October to all.

May 1977 graduates of
Washington and Lee. Out of the
301 graduates, 249 responded to
the survey, almost 83 percent.

The study of law proved to be
the most popular postgraduate
field of education. Almost 13
percent of the class of 1977 went
on to law school.

Those entering medical and
dental schools last fall compos-
ed 8% percent of last year’s
graduating class, while 5 per-
cent entered MBA programs.

Business majors might be
surprised to learn that graduate
schools of business administra-
tion that recruit at W&L prefer
undergraduates with majors
other than business. Cappeto
said that one reason for this is
that business majors at
Washington and Lee might have
already had much of the
material covered in master’s
programs.

Those seniors who bypassed
graduate and professional pro-
grams and entered directly into

the job market were, for the
most part, satisfied with their
occupations, according to the
survey.

95.1 percent of those business
majors repsonding to the
survey believed that their pre-
sent jobs held career potential.
Underemployement, often a
major complaint of college
graduates, was not a problem
for the class of 1977, the survey
showed.

Of those responding to the
survey who had full time jobs,
76.1 percent said that their oc-
cupations required a college
degree. Of the remaining 23.1
percent who considered
themselves underemployed,
roughly half saw no future in
what they were doing.

By last October, almost nine
percent of the class of 1977 was
unemployed. The unemploy-
ment figure is ‘‘right around the
national average”’ for 1977 male
college graduates with a
bachelor of arts degree, ac-
cording to Cappeto.

The median annual starting
Salaries for W&L’s_ 1977
graduates was between $9,000
and $10,000, the survey showed.
This is below the national
average of ‘‘around $10,500”’ for
recent college grads, said Cap-
peto. Business and science
graduates earned the highest
median salary, between $10,000
and $11,000, while journalism
and communications graduates
were making the lowest,
averaging between $7,000 and
$8,000 annually.

Generals take 3 of 4.
over Wash.’s break

by Mark Mitchel

The Washington and Lee
basketball Generals completed
their regular season last week
by winning 3 of 4 away games.

On Saturday, they lost to Ran-
dolph Macon College, a Division
I school, 89-74.

Using a running and pressing
game, the Randolph Macon
Yellow Jackets jumped out toa
23-6 lead. Yet the Generals kept
working and pulled within two
at 44-42. After the Generals
missed an opportunity to tie the
game, the Yellow Jackets
tightened. Lead by penetrating
guard Kevin Woods, who had 21
points and a game high 11
assists, the Yellow Jackets
buzzed inside for easy shots to
take a 58-46 lead. Steve Sklaba

Dennis dribbles.

had a career high 32 points
against the Generals hitting on
12-of-15 shots from the field.
Macon’s great penetration
(after theGenerals almost tied
the game up, Macon scored ten
of its next 14 points on shots no
fartrer than one foot away)
allowed them to shoot 64 per-
cent for the game.

Even though they lost, there
were many bright spots for the
Generals. The brightest spot
was the play of sixth man,
Bruce Williams. Williams had
16 points, hitting on 8 of 13 shots
from the field, in addition to be-
ing the Generals’ leading re-
bounder.

The team connected on 10 of
10 free throws in the second half
and managed to shoot 96 per-
cent from the line for the game.

The Generals then won an ex-
hibition game against Brock
University, 92-89. In that game,
Dennis had 28 points, and
Smitherman was 5 for 5 from
the field. But perhaps was the

 

most important factor was the
Generals’ dominance on the
boards. Meyer had 11 rebounds,
while Williams had 10 (5 of
them offensive), as the
Generals outrebounded Brock
536 to 29.

Against the University of
Rochester, Pat Dennis scored
22 points to move pass
Rochester coach Mike Neer into
seventh place on the all time
Washington and Lee scoring
list. Dennis had scored over
1300 points for Washington and
Lee. The Generals took com-
mand early and coasted to a
81-74 victory over Rochester.
Larry Meyer also had 22 points
for the Generals. Meyer and-
Dennis shared high rebounding
honors, each with 8. These Re-

bounds were important because
centers Collins and Smither-
man, and junior forward Dave
Leunig all fouled out.

The Generals then travelled
to Bridgewater.For the tenth
straight time, Washington and
Lee defeated the Eagles, this
time the Eagles lost 95-91.

Many Generals ended the
regular season on a promising
note. Bruce Williams led all
scorers with 24 points, hitting on
12 of 18 from the field. Williams
was only one of five double
figure scorers for the Generals.
Dennis had 22, Smitherman had
16 (7 out of 13 from the field),
Meyer had 15 (also 7 out of 13
from the floor), and Leunig had
12 points. Smitherman also had
11 rebounds as the Generals
outrebounded the wingless
Eagles 46-28.

Thus, the Generals concluded
a successful regular season
with a 19-5 record.

Swimmers eye State Crown

by Jerry Harris
and Neil Cote

After an easy conquest of Old
Dominion and a forfeit over
Virginia Commonwealth
University during the holiday
break, the W&L Generals
swimming team is preparing
for the very important State
Championship Swimming Meet
to be held this weekend.

The Generals had an easy
time of it against the homestan-
ding O.D. Monarchs breezing to
a 68-39 win on Saturday, Feb. 11.
VCU forfeited their scheduled
meet with the Generals due to
an outbreak of the flu that
debilitated the team. However,
W&L will get an opportunity to
face the Commonwealth club in
the state meet.

Commenting on the upcoming
match, Coach Stearns said,
“It’s going to be interesting.”’
The trials will begin Thursday
morning and end with the finals
on Saturday evening. All of the
events will be held at James
Madison University.

Obviously, the Generals see
this meet as a golden opportuni-
ty to prove that they are indeed
a swimming power in the state.
Even though W&L has posted
several winning seasons of late
and have had a number of All-
Americans they still face the
stigma of being a Division III
school which is trying to com-
plete on a Division I level. So
Coach Stearns and his charges
would like nothing better than
to win the state championships.

However, the likelihood of
that evening is slim. As Coach
Stearns points out the Universi-
ty of Richmond is a clear
favorite to capture the title.
“They should win,” declared
Stearns. ‘‘Not only do they have
some super swimmers but
they’re also large in numbers.”’
He went on to point out that
while W&L can only count on
mavbe 10 swimmers placing in
the meet, Richmond is likely to
have 19 or more to place. As a
result, even if the Generals go
one, two in a number of events,
they might still fall short.

Stearns sees a four-way battle
for second place with Virginia
Tech, VCU and William and
Mary challenging the Generals.

top swimmer since he was a
freshman, but having lived in
California all his life, he wanted
a change.

“T was tired of the state,’’ he
said. “I wanted a change of
pace. I decided to give an
eastern college a chance.”

Since coming to W&L, Kent
has been very happy with his
classes, the swim team and his
new friends.

“The fact that there weren’t

rugged six-foot swimmer said.
‘“‘But now that I’m here, I think
I made the right choice.”’

Kent, a_ history and
philosophy major who brought
a 3.3 grade-point average from
Claremont to W&L, has fitted in
well with the Generals’ swimm-
ing team. Already, he has
broken two school records, the
200 yard backstroke and the 200
yard individual medley.

The modest Kent attributes
much of his success to his
coach.

“Stearns knows as much or
more about swimming than
anyone else I know,”’ he said.

said a number of them are
understandably upset at having
to miss the Fancy Dress
weekend.

“Those are the breaks,”
Stearns said, “But the guys
have gone to far to let that
bother them.”’

Stearns, though optimistic
about his team’s chances at
Madison, concedes that the

planning on putting on their

ODAC championships today

by Mark Mitchell

The Generals are aiming for
their second consecutive ODAC
tournament championship this
Friday and Saturday at Lyn-
chburg College. The Generals, a
team that has won twenty of
twenty-two ODAC games in the
last two years, and nine of their
last ten games, is seeded first in
the tournament. Finishing first
in the tournament guarantees
the team a berth in the NCAA
Division III tournament.

As first seed, the generals
take on the 5-19 Bridgewater
Eagles. The Generals seem to
be just too strong on the boards
and have too much depth for
Bridgewater, so the Generals
should beat Bridgewater for the
eleventh time in a row.

The Generals will have to
play well in the finals, however.

 

   
    

Dave Leunig goes up for shot.

They will either take on
Hampden-Sydney, the team
that accounts for Washington
and Lee’s only conference loss
or Lynchburg. The Generals
have a rough time with the
Tigers even when they win.
Some fans may recall that
Sydney missed several shots in
the waning seconds of the first
meeting this season that gave
the Generals a one point victory
over the Tigers on the W&L
court. Two years ago, the
Generals needed a 20 footer by
Larson with 5 seconds left to
beat Sydney by 1.

Should they play Lynchburg,
they will have to beat a good
team, three times in one season.
A difficult feat under any cir-
cumstances, made more dif-
ficult by the fact that Lyn-
chburg will be playing on their
home court. Over the years, the

and exciting. It may very well
be close enough so that crowd
support, not strategy, will pro-
vide the Generals with the winn-
ing edge.

Swimmers

are 10-1

(continued from page 6)

Stearns, now in his twelfth
season as Swimmng coach, has
good reason to be happy. His
team finished the regular
season with a 10-1 record, the
best in the school’s history, and
stand a good chance at winning
the Virginia State Champion-
ships, to be held this weekend at
James Madison University in
Harrisonburg.

This is the best team I’ve
coached,” he said confidently.

The W&L swimming pro-
gram has consistantly produced
some of the best teams in the
country since it was started in
1920. Stearns has done well to
carry the tradition with a 82-33
record dating back to 1966.

‘‘We’ve been fortunate,’’ the

balding coach said. ‘‘We have
found top athletes who ap-
preciate a good education and a
chance to swim for a good
team.”
NCAA Division III National
Championships which will be
held at Grinell, Iowa from
March 11 to March 18.

The Generals finished ninth in
the championships last year
and Stearns says they should do
even better this season.

Going into the state match on-
ly three W&L swimmers are
qualified for the nationals —

’ John Hudson, Keith Romich

and freshman diver Jay Dies-
ing. However, Stearns fully ex-
pects five others to qualify this
weekend — Scott Duff, Peter
Meem, Chip Hoke, Bob
Newcomb and Drew Pillsbury.

The citation to Emmer,
presented at the annual Lyn-

described ‘‘his signal contribu-
tion to the enhancement of the
university’s image through in-
tercollegiate competition and
sportsmanship.”’

Each spring in Lexington, it
noted, ‘“‘a young man’s fancy
turns to love and lacrosse with
equal fervor.”’

The citation also commended
Emmer’s ‘‘strength of

other jobs — ‘‘first the siren call
of his alma mater (Rutgers)

Strips of multi-colored cor-
rugated paper of all shapes and
sizes dotted the student center’s
red carpet. Hammers pounded
together wooden frames.

“That won’t fit,’ said one
worker, complaining about the
need for more material needed
to cover the odd-shaped wooden
rectangular skeleton over the
Cockpit entrance.

‘Don’t worry,” said another,
‘once we get the paper on it you
won't be able to tell the dif-
ference.”’

Who would be diligent enough
to be working at 2:00 a.m., long
after the late movie had
flickered off the tube? Maybe
they should be called the Fancy
Dress Workaholics Club.
Regardless, The Student Ac-
tivities Board (SAB) is spen-
ding most of its waking hours
this week preparing for the
school’s biggest social event of
the year.

“We only have two more
nights to get ready,” says one
worker as he taps a piece of rip-
pled plastic-backed corrugated
paper ariy around around the
water fountain across the hall
from the TV room.

Town could care less
about Fancy Dress

by Jim Lynn

What does Fancy Dress mean
to the citizens of Lexington? Is
it a classic display of high-class
partying, or is it merely college
kids putting on their ‘monkey
suits’ and going crazy on grain
and beer?

This may come as a shock to
many students, but the mer-
chants and townspeople of Lex-
ington do not see Fancy Dress
weekend as Virginia’s answer
to Ft. Lauderdale over Easter
vacation. Most motels notice a
slight increase in occupancy
and it is tougher to get a dinner
reservation, but they see no

€ye and Lar:

Nostalgia is chic and memory
speaks: Fancy Dress Ball, 1942.

To this New England college
girl in the years just before
World War II there were three
events of prime social
significance. Dartmouth Car-
nival, The Harvard-Yale game
and Washington and Lee Fancy
Dress Ball. Althugh I didn’t
know where or what
Washington and Lee was, I had
certainly heard of its Ball. I suc-
ceeded in getting to Dartmouth
Carnival and Harvard-Yale
game right on schedule but dan-
cing at Fancy Dress didn’t
come along until I was well on
the way to becoming a Lex-
ington matron — and quite
visibly —motherhood.

The 1942 Fancy Dress Ball
had an awful poignancy. The
United States was at war follow-
ing the attack on Pearl Harbor
two months before. The
students of that year could look

reason to make any special
plans to accommodate fun-
seeking collegiates out on the
town. The Holiday Inn and the
Keydet-General report that all
of their rooms are filled for the
weekend, and reservations for
dinner at the Keydet-General
are booked. The Keydet-
General usually has special
rates for groups on big college
weekends, but since the majori-
ty of the rooms are being filled
with people having nothing to do
with Fancy Dress, no special
rates apply.

Those who put off getting
reservations for dinner will

ahead to only one future —
military service.

The aura of special elegance
was over us all. The invitation
was an elaborate as a command
appearance before the King of
England, (with an enclosed
numbered card to be presented
at the door). One thousand
glamourous. costumes were
shipped from Philadelphia to be
rented out to each couple for the
large sum of $5. Girls arrived in
town days ahead — using the
excuse that they must practice
for the figure which opened the
Ball.

At nine-thirty the doors of the
old gym were locked against all
late arrivals and the fanfare
began with an intricate figure.
The ladies in long, full white
dresses, each carrying an arm-
ful of bright red roses; their
escorts in white-tie and tails,

Lion’s Den which does not take
reservations on nights that they
expect big crowds.

The local tuxedo outlets for
Lexington perhaps do the big-
gest business over the weekend.
Mike Thorton of Alvin-Dennis
said that all of their available
tuxedos have been reserved.
Prices for tuxedos from Alvin-
Dennis run from $15 to $39, and
considering that they have
rented several hundred, they
have had slower weekends.

The flower merchants also
have a big increase in business.

Nobody staggered; no one saw
— or smelled — any sign of
alcohol. That alcohol was
around we did not doubt — but it
was discreetly nipped.

The floor stayed crowded —
and dry — until intermission at
one o’clock. Then w)on we went
to a ‘‘Supper.’’ Ham, roast beef,
scalloped oysters, molded
salads — ending with a fantasy
desert of sherbet draped in spun
sugar! The conversation was
light and local; for this night we
kept the world at bay.

We danced all night and
breakfasted in party clothes —
wilted red roses tossed away —

ed in memory. By June the

dancers, not to be filled up

quite as large as the ones built
4500 years ago, this ones made
out of wood, not blocks.

Outside, heavy falling snow
on this wintry Tuesday evening
is painting an almost
Christmas-like atmosphere in
which the workers on the inside
are feverishly working, almost
like Santa’s elves.

Fancy Dress, or whatever
name you have for it, is pro-
bably even bigger than
Christmas or New Years Eve on
this small campus, especially
for Fancy Dress coordinator
Art Dunnam.

Dunnam, a sophomore, is a
wisp of a fellow. Tall and lean,
hs filled with energy needed to
do the job of putting it all
together, talked openly about
how the theme for this year’s
extravaganza, ‘A Night in
Egypt’, was conceived and con-
structed.

“Steve Mangan coame up
with the original idea,’ said
Dunnam, ‘and early this year
the board approved it.’’ Dun-
nam added tha that once the
theme was decided two people
were appointed to plan the
building, order materials and
organize workers, mostly SAB
member, to do the job.

Dunnam said he, along with
others like senior Jim
Foresman and chairman Bill
Tucker have been working
since the beginning of the term
on what many consider one of
the finest formal college dances
in the country.

As coordinator Dunnam
estimated he may have put in

four, 40-hour weeks already.
“Jim, (Foreman) who is also
treasurer,’ said Dunnam, “‘has
been working even longer.”’

Their work will not go un-
noticed. The outside doors
leading into the Dining Hall,
scene of the big ball, will be
guarded by two 6” by 7’ pain-
tings of Tutankhamen, an
Egyptian ruler from 14B.C.

Scattered among the piles of
loose paper and junk in the SAB
headquarters are innumerable
cardboard signs. Some tell of
the ‘*treasures of
Tutankhamen.’ There are
signs for coatrooms, dressing
rooms, signs telling you where
to go and what to do and who
will be doing it when you get
there. Colorful paper statues of
Nefertiti, Queen of the Nile, lay
strewn on the floor as remnants
of the months of planning which
all leads up to the big event
tonight. Paper mache palm
trees lay limp in the far side of
the room. Glitter, as one might
expect, is plentiful. ‘‘If it means
anything,’’ said Dunnam,
“‘we’ve used over two pounds of
glitter so far.”” Dunnam added
that he even tried to get Egyp-
tian travel posters for the dance
to enhance the atmosphere,
“but the travel service was all
out.”’

W&L students will have the
luxury of seeing a live camel
standing on the front porch of
Fairfax Lounge. ‘‘We’ve rented
him,”’ said Dunnam, ‘“‘and his
keeper will be dressed in egyp-
tian attire.”

The lounge itself will have

who want to escape the noise
and confusion in the ballrooom

Maria Muldaur’s ‘Midnight at

Now transformed into what
appears to be a caravan tent,
the Cockpit will be lit by a varie-
ty of colored lights glowing
from their nests in the ceiling.
Exotic belly dancer ‘‘Jameela’”’
will perform, as will pianist
George Fischoff, on and off
throughout the mght. Free soft

who tire of the Lowenbrau dark,
Miller and Miller ‘‘Lite’”’ being
served in the ballroom.

In fact, according to Dunnam,
over 90 kegs of the foamy brew
will be used, served at the new-
ly constructed 30 foot long
wooden bar. “‘The bar cost us
$580 to build,” said Dunnam,
“but it saves us the trouble of
lugging down all those filing
cabinets from the SAB office.”

Dunnam said the big surprise
will come from the art studio
over in Dupont Hall. Art pro-
fessor Dr. I-Hsuing Ju has
painted some pictures especial-
ly for the occasion, but to tell
now would spoil the fun.

For movie buffs and their
dates unable to break the tube
room habit, five movies will be
shown: ‘Foreign Legion,”
“The Mummy’s Ghost,” ‘Pink
Sphinx,”’ ‘‘Lad and his Lamp,”’
and ‘Prince Violent.’’ Dunnam
said there were no old Rudolph
Valentino movies available,
‘“‘And the Cleopatra movies are
too long, “‘he added.

Who’s going to clean up after
all the partying is done? ‘‘The
two janitors who work in the
Student Center usually have it

all cleaned up by Saturday mor-
ning,” said Dunnam. Assistant
Dining Hall manager Burr Datz
said a crew of workers has been
hired to clean up the mess there
on Saturday morning.

Chamber Players excel

by Robert Boardman Tremblay

The avante-garde Theater
Chamber Players put on a con-
cert Tuesday night that should
not have been missed, not just
because of the great music and
fine performing (there certain-
ly was plenty of that), but
because of a chance to hear the
funniest piece I’ve ever heard.
The composition I’m referring
to is Gyorgy Ligeti’sNouvelles
Aventures, and what an
“ad“aventure’’ it is! Of course,
the piece contains the tradi-
tional man-playing-inside-of-
the-piano routine plus nonsense
syllables and other weird
musical noises, but what truly
turns this work into an ensem-
ble of hysterics are the per-
formanes of soprano Phyllis
Bryn-Julson, mezzo-soprano
Rose Taylor, and baritone
Richard Frisch. Their acting
(remember their name is the
Theater Chamber Players) was
priceless, from stares that
could kill to fits of laughter and
crying, it was all marvelous not
to mention their fine overall
singing as well. Other
highlights of this classic tour-
de-force were the beating of a
rug, the ripping of newspaper,
the rattling of marbles, and for
that subtle touch, the smashing
of a tray of dishes and glasses.

Just beautiful, but there was.

cert.

The Theater Chamber

Girolamo Arrigo. This piece

that can be achieved from the

soprano voice (Phyllis Bryn-

Julson). The piccolo, alto, bass,

Two pieces by Anton Webern,

The Flower Center on Main
Street has been supplying cor-
sages for the past 25 years, and
manager Guy Mahoney has
noticed changing trends in their
popularity.

“There has been a recent
boom of buying corsages for
dates. Last year we sold over
500 and this year we hope to sell
more.”

Huffman’s Florist is new, and
already they have more than
100 corsages ordered for the

Friday night dance. The
average price for a corsage at
Huffman’s is $6.50, so with a lit-
tle simple arithematic it’s plain
to see that it will be a good
weekend for them.

selection of articulate adjective

‘‘disappointing.”’

Burt Reynolds and Kris

Miami Dolphins in history).
Robert Preston portrays the
team’s owner with Jill
Clayburgh his alluring

with Burt and Kris. A lot of sex.

Wrong.

The sec, contrary to the
poster in the front of the
theater, is non-existent. Even
suggestiveness is minimal.
There are only sporadic oc-
curances of football action
scenes. Any good jokes and
gags come few and far between,
and even a spoof on ESP, at the
end of the film, misses its mark,
as the audience is left only grin-
ning (or sleeping). The acting is
OK. So is the direction. In fact,
even the photography is OK.
However, that’s the problem.
Everything is just a plain, bor-
ing’ disappointing “OK.” You
could have more fun standing

The film, which will obviously
be based on the album by the
Beatles, will star the Bee Gees
and Peter Frampton. In addi-
tion, Aerosmith, Alice Cooper,
Eath, Wind and Fire, Billy
Preston and George Burns will
be tabled guest stars with Steve
Martin (who will be playing Dr.
Maxwell Edison).

ELO

Musical Mainstream

by Mark Mainwaring
Associate Music Director
WLUR-FM
Out of the Blue
Electric Light Orchestra
United Artists ITLA-823-L2

I’ve listened to it half a dozen
times, and I still can’t figure out
why I like this album. ELO
hasn’t really done anything new
or innovative since their classic
Eldorado, and Out of the Blue is
no exception. Jeff Lynne is still
“borrowing” a lot of his
melodic riffs and vocal styles
from other bands, especially
the Beatles — so much so on this
album that he should be sending
half his royalties to Lennon and
McCartney. ELO’s so-called
“classical rock” is really
nothing more than rock and roll
with strings, not any real in-
tegration of classical and rock
music.

The fact remains that since
its inception, the Electric Light
Orchestra has been turning out
some of the best pop and com-
mercial rock to be found.
Lushly produced and or-
chestrated,Out of the Blue con-
tinues in this tradition of ex-
cellence. ‘Turn to Stone’”’ is the
band’s best single since ‘‘Can’t
Get It Out of My Head,” and
side three’s ‘“‘Concerto for a
Rainy Day” flows together in a
manner reminiscent of the
previously mentionedEldorado
(for you trivia fans, the
thunderstorms heard on this
side of the record were record-

ed simply by hanging a
microphone out of the studio
window). This album is very
commercial, right down to the

kidding!), but recommended
nonetheless.

Former guitarist for the
Dutch group Focus, Jan Akker-

has more of a disco-funk feeling
(but still retains a basically jazz
and Jazz-rock sound). Though
an excellent guitar player, Ak-
kerman doesn’t use his talents
to their fullest on this record,
and adds too much instrumen-
tal and background ‘‘filler’”’ in
the slow spots. A decent record
(with a great cover!), but one
would expect more from a man
with Akkerman’s capabilities

Room decorations give rubble look

By Ned McDonnell

Psychologists the world over
have often claimed that room
decorations are truly indicative
of the inner and many times
hidden characteristics and ten-
sions of the individual dweller.
At the behest of its social
responsibilities, this reporter,
on behalf of the Ring-tum Phi
staff, has been vested with the
solemn duty of informing the
W&L community what posters
and other paraphenalia and
what different modes of room
decoration reflect about a per-
son . After all, girls who are in
the early stages of a dating rela-
tionship will use what’s in the
room as much as their date’s

actions: to gain, or’ to Solidify, »,

the first and most crucial im-
pressions of a W&L man.

While the style of interior
decoration helps in giving a
general overview of the
dweller’s personality, in-
dividual items connote more
specific aspects of the person’s
character. The ten most com-
mon room decorations and what
they imply psycholica lly are:

A) A Confederate Flag: If a
southerner owns a rebel flag, he
is either a twentieth century
Rhett Butler with an identity
crisis due to the loss of the last
great war or a frivolous carpet-
bagger using it as an agent for
social authenticity. If a nor-
therner: usually residual
dough-face carried over from

. the days.of Franklin Pieree.: - - ---

B) Farrah Faweett Poster :
One of three possibilities: a
teenager plagued with a freu-
dian oral complex, a malleable
pawn of the mass media
culture, or a ninety-seven pound
weakling trying to convince
himself that somewhere,
somehow he has a small grain
of machismo.

C) A picture of the dweller
above desk: Most probably an
apathetic egomaniac who
prefe's gocking at himself in-
stead of involving himself in
such mundane activities as
homework. Usually has a 2.0
average at best.

or three steps). The playing by
Miss Koston and the singing by
Miss Bryn-Julson were precise

and enjoyable.
The Pattita in D Minor
(including the famous

Chaconne) by J. S. Bach follow-
ed as a nice transition. Miss
Carmirelli was the violinist
again and she was nothing less
than superb in her performance
of this technical workhouse.
Tricky doublestops abound as
does complicated polyphonic
weaving, but all were handled
with seeming ease by Miss Car-
mirelli. The Chaconne might
have been played without all the
repeats, but what it added in
length to some, added enjoy-
ment to others. (In the Baroque
Period, liberties were taken in
such matters as repatts so its

debatable which method of.

playing is correct. )

After the intermission, the
euphonic sounds of Boccherini
took over with the exquisite
playing of his Quintet in D. Ma-
jor. Miss Carmirelli, 1st
violinist, Hyo Kang, second
violinist, Masao Kawasaki,
violinist, Hakuro Mori, cellist,
and David Starobin, guitarist,
performed this delightful piece
with the vitality and feeling that
Boccherini no doubt intended.
As far as form is concerned,
Boccherini is not going to rival
his contemporary Beethoven in
experimentation (for example,
this work’s development sec-
tions are fairly standard and
the recapitulations are also
predictable), but his manipula-

tion of the various instruments
in this ensemble is masterful.
Some beautiful harmonics on
the cello, strings played colegno
(with the wood of the bow), and
a lively fandango at the end
with castenet-like accompani-
ment provided by the cellist and
the guitarist all added up to a
truly exciting performance.

The final piece on this varied
program was, of course, the
aforementioned Ligeti
Nouvelles Aventures, but I
could not close this review
without giving kudos to contra-
bassist Frank Carnovale, whose
frantic playing in one section
was certainly memorable, to
Robert Sheldon, who was for-
tunate enjoy to play his horn in-
to a bottle, to Albert Merz, the
percussionist who played on
almost everything imaginable
from balloons to marbles’ to
Donald Sutherland, who played.
the harpsichord as well as the
inside of the piano, and finally
to the conductor, Leon Fleisher,
who held this challenging piece
together from the start. Con-
ducing these episodes may
seem easy, but they are not, it
takes exact timing among other
talents and Mr. Fleisher has
them all.

A special word of praise, in
closing, should go to the direc-
tors of the Theater Chamber
Players, Leon Fleisher and
Dina Koston. Their troupe gave
a great performance Tuesday
night, musically and theatrical-
ly. It was indeed a concert
worth attending. Those who
didn’t missed a great time.

Classically overindulged with

Of course, the room decorations

C) The All-American prep

usually with a lacrosse stick,
squash, and tennis racket in

and a baseball mitt on the desk.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

EC: Watchdog
or Watcher?

One may wonder if the student body of Washington
and Lee actually has a representative body. The Ex-
ecutive Committee, in failing to suggest specific
changes in Student Control procedure to the Student
Affairs Committee, has not fulfilled its duty to the stu-
dent body. In the words of Tom Healy, senior law
representative, ‘‘I don’t think the E.C. should attempt
to tell SAC what to do.”’ If the E.C. won’t tell SAC what
to do concerning students’ interests, students should
begin to question the realism of student government
at W&L.

Technically, the E.C. has no power over the Student
Control Committee or its procedures besides appoint-
ment and removal of SCC members. SAC does have
this power. It is with SAC that students must deal to
ensure fair treatment in the future by Student Con-

trol. The procedures Student Control follows do not

take into account the basic rights of students. In fact,
students have unknowingly left themselves open to
search, arrest, indictment and trial in the past.

Student Control meetings are closed and secret,
supposedly for the protection of the accused. Without
being warned of possible legal consequences, an ac-
cused student is compelled to admit guilt or innocence
at an SCC hearing. What SAC and SCC members have
failed to realize and what students are not made
aware of is that no privilege exists between SCC
members and an accused student. The accused’s con-
fession to a third person (the SCC) may indicate pro-
bable cause for arrest or for a grand jury to indict the
accused. If the accused should go to trial, an SCC
member could be compelled to testify against him
under threat of criminal or civil contempt of court. A
confession obtained by the SCC may be used as
evidence at a criminal trial of an accused student.

After Monday’s EC meeting, it is evident that
students’ rights have not been taken into account dur-
ing SCC proceedings. After reading the SCC’s pro-
cedural guidelines it is also evident that no provisions
have been made for the accused’s rights. Finally, it is
evident our EC is on the surface very attractive, but
below the surface irresponsible and _ without
backbone. The EC should have sent a strongly worded
proposal to SAC recommending changes in SCC pro-
cedure that would take into account the rights of the
accused, with special emphasis put on the accused’s
Miranda rights.

In Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the U. S. Supreme
Court extended the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination to custodial interrogation.
Television has provided familiarity with these rights.

Responses to editorial outcry

Dear Editor,

Some things in life are in-
evitable, death, taxes, and be-
ing harrangued by the editor of
Ariel. Perhaps my pleas will be
somewhat more pleasant than
the other two, I know it serves'a
more worthwhile end.

As per usual in the beginning
of a contribution period I am
scrambling, looking for places
to print in Ariel. As I hope was
demonstrated by the first issue,
there is no set standard for
which I am searching other
than for the nebulous ideal,
literary quality.

It matters not what is written
about, or how it is written
about, so long as it is written
well. This statement is not
meant to scare anyone away,

there are many of you out there ©

capable of writing well in a
number of different forms,
witness Ariel I. I simply wish to
emphasize the wide range of
kinds of pieces I would like to in-
clude in Ariel.

As far as specifics go, I am
looking at at least 32, perhaps 36
pages. That is to suggest that I

be turned over to the EC.

An EC genuinely concerned with representing the
student body to its best ability and not with fear of ruf-

faculty would have suggested changes such as these.
Students should demand these rights when they are
confronted by the SCC, and should demand better
representation from the EC.

make one final request.
Recognizing as I must, the
fact that ‘‘Poems should be as

axiom that ‘‘a_ literary

own article

Dear Editor:

I will be teaching a film
course in the English Depart-
ment this spring, and I was
therefore especially ap-
preciative of the opportunity to
review “Saturday Night Fever”
in the last issue of the paper.
Anything you can do to enhance
serious student interest in what
is arguably the great art form
of our century-film-is perform-
ing a valuable and praise-
worthy service.

It is precisely on this ground,
however, that I have some

reservations about The Ring-

tum Phi’s handling of my
review. I would have thought
that a major aim of the paper

_ Was to present its material in a

+ way that would catch the eye of

- the largest possible number of
» students.

I was disturbed, therefore, by
the decision to title my article
“Disco and ERA, a ‘feverish’
combination.” Fewer students
are likely to read an article that
sounds, from the title, as though
it is about feminist politics than
will read an article that is clear-
ly about ‘Saturday Nigh
Fever.’ I discussed certain
large cultural issues which
emerged from the film’s plot,
images, and ambivalences.
That is, I thought of myself as
writing a movie review, not a
brief for the National Organiza-
tion for Women, and it was
reductive and self-defeating to
imply otherwise in the title.

Another self-defeating aspect
of the way in which the paper
handled the review was the
failure to identify me as a facul-
ty member. If this information
had been printed in a by-line
under my name, as is done by
many school papers in similar
circumstances, and as I unders-
tand was done by this paper
other years, it would not only,
perhaps, have enlarged the
readership for the article, but
also have increased the
dialogue on this campus bet-
ween faculty and students. As it
is now, very few faculty
members contribute to the stu-
dent paper, a trend which I
presume it would be valuable to
reverse.

More Letters

To the editor of the Ring-tum
Phi:

In your newspaper’s editorial
last week, and by way of im-
plication in the news article on
which it was in part based, you
assert that there seems to exist
some correlation between this
year’s mid-season decline in ap-
plications, on the one hand, and
data from previous years in-
dicating that many students
whom W&L accepted wished
that the University were
coeducational, on the other
hand.

The logic is spurious.

Your article purports to ex-
amine factors which may in-
fluence students to apply for ad-
mission or which may
discourage them from applying
for admission.

The fact, however, is: The —

University has never under-
taken a survey of applicants,
and there exists no data about
those influences.

The only surveys ever under-
taken in the admissions field
have been among students who
have been accepted and come to
W&L and those who have been
accepted and go elsewhere.
Neither of those surveys has
ever asked which of the Univer-
sity’s characteristics influenc-
ed them to apply in the first
place.

I wish there were such

surveys; my own livelihood
depends in_ considerable
measure, after all, on
Washington and Lee’s success
in attracting highly qualified
students who ultimately enroll
as students.

It is the height of intellectual
shallowness (if you will permit
the metaphorical contradiction,
if you recognize it) to ask
thoughtful people to conclude —
even before all the quantitative
data are in (much less the
qualitative data) — that a
characteristic which has re-
mained static can explain a
dramatic statistical
aberration— especially when it
occurs simultaneously with a
mind-boggling new variable
such as the infamous essay.
(Perhaps the Ring-tum Phi
might more usefully inquire in-
to why we have as many ap-
plications as we do, considering
this formidable new obstacle we
have placed in the paths of our
applicants — practically the
equivalent of requiring a term
paper which we then charge $15
to grade.)

Your implicit assumption
that sheer numbers of applica-
tions is what we seek is, at the
outset, disturbing. We boast, in
fact, that “the admissions pro-
cess at Washington and Lee is

   

 

SUPPLY STORE

not a numbers game.” (The

quote is from admissions
literature sent both to
secondary-school guidance

counselors since 1974 and to
every freshman applicant since
1975.) Quality — and em-
phatically not mere numbers
for numbers’ sake — has been
the University’s aim for as long
as I can remember. We were no
less non-coeducational when
you enrolled, after all, than we
are today.

As matters stand now, of
course, the jury is still out; the
admissions professionals —
much less the student press —
have no way of knowing
whether Washington and Lee’s
experiment with the essay will
succeed. The possibility exists
that you are right. But if you
are, it is coincidence, not
science. The data do not yet ex-
ist to tell.

The fact that I have focused
on only one part of the Ring-tum
Phi’s illogic should in no
measure be taken as an indica-
tion that any of the other data
presented can be regarded as
accurate. Whoever told you, for
instance, that “W&L’s SAT
scores over the past 10 years
have dropped by 70 points while
the nation’s have dropped by 50
points” is a liar or a fool or an
employee of Hampden-Sydney,
or maybe all of the above. The
professor you quote as having
announced that applications
were down by 56 percent has an-
nounced that you got his state-
ment exactly backwards, and
your own front-page figures
back him up. And if you think
coeducation brings about some
automatic improvement in
either the number or caliber of
applicants, you should check —
as the University has — with
some of the colleges which went
coeducational when it was so
fashionalbe a few years ago; a
number of them will confess to
you that, after all, it has not
turned out to be the admissions
panacea they hoped it would be.

Please be aware that these
comments are mine alone and
have not been checked with,
much less approved by, any
other person connected with the
University administration (nor
did I seek such endorsement).

Is It Really Our Gym?

Ken Mastrilli
RtP Sports Commentary

Having failed dismally in my
plans to become a college
basketball star like W&L’s Pat
Dennis or VMI’s Ron Carter,
my basketball heroics have
been limited to times when I
can make it over to the new
gym to play a quick pick-up
game of ‘“‘hoops’’.

Like myself, many students
at W&L can only make it to t
the Warner Center, commonly
known as the new gym, at night.
Why can I (or other students)
only seem to use the gym at
nights? A number of reasons,
quite simply.

In the morning there are
physical education classes,
also, most students have
classes and who wants to play
basketball, or anything else, at
8:00 a.m. In the afternoon there
is usually basketball practice
beginning around 3:30 p.m.
That means everyone gets kick-
ed out around 3:00. '

This manuever — shoves
everyone into the old gym
where one encounters maybe
200 people playing on a floor
built for 30.

At other times one finds the
new gym filled with baseball
players preparing for the fall
season, Some coaches in the
athletic department have decid-
ed that getting practices started
as early in the year as possible
is beneficial, but I have never
seen an indoor baseball game
played on a basketball court
and the logic of practicing on
one escapes me.

Trying to avoid this mass con-
fusion, students come to the
gym at night. But many times
this year they’ve been thwarted
by hundreds of cheering, yelling

and tobacco chewing tans ex-
horting their basketball or
wrestling team to victory in one
of the numerous local high
school tournaments held at the
Warner Center. Also, the gym is
used to conduct various sports
clinics for the Rockbridge area.

Is the Warner Center, built
for students by funds donated
from a private individual to
private institutions, turning into
a local sports arena in the in-
terest of community service

and furthering the growth of

W&L-Lexington relations.

That’s what the athletic
department says. They also
receive a fee for renting the
gym. I wonder if Mr. Warner
knows the center in his honor,
built in the hopes that W&L var-
sity as well as student athletics
would prosper, is being rented
out on a regular basis?

Athletic Director Bill
McHenry has said that the state
of Virginia has asked all univer-
sities and colleges in the state to
cooperate in improving local
relations by sponsoring such
events as high school clinics
and tournaments.

The Pioneer District Basket-
ball tournament held here this
week is a good case in point. It
has prevented students from us-

ing the gym on three con-
secutive evenings this week.
Why not use the old gym?
Because the soccer team holds
two-hour practices there on
several nights during the week.
Who wants to wait two hours.
Most get fed-up and leave.

Students need a place to work
off the tensions that a day of
classes can build up inside the
body, especially in the winter
when outside physical activity
is limited to those willing to
brave 20 degree temperatures.
Excepting rain, nice weather
during fall and_ spring
somewhat alleviates crowding
the gym.

But some students say there
is no need for the soccer team to
practice inside. Considering the
soccer teams’ record in harsh
weather conditions, one
wonders how much inside prac-
tice helps.

Another question. Why don’t
these high schools play their
games in their own gyms?
Because they know we have a
nice facility that can hold a lot
of people. That’s why. At the
present rate, however, it won’t
remain nice very long.

Does the school really need
the money? I doubt it. But as
long as no one says anything,
nothing will happen.

Law center head

Fred Kirgis

A leading international law
authority, Frederic L. Kirgis
Jr., has been named the first
director of Washington and Lee
University’s Frances Lewis
Law Center.

According to a description ot
its purpose adopted by the W&L
law faculty, the Frances Lewis
Center will examine legal doc-
trines and institutions in the
context of pertinent social
values and attitudes, with the
goal of formulating ‘‘ap-
propriate responses regarding
the objectives to be sought” and
specific proposals for achieving
those objectives.

The law center is designed to
function in support of W&L’s
law faculty and students both
inside and outside the formal
law-school curriculum. W&L
faculty may be able to take sab-
baticals to work full-time on
law-center research projects;
there may be research pro-,
grams for students and summer
research opportunities for
faculty members. Visiting
scholars may be brought to the
law center in residence for a
semester or academic year or
for the summer; there may be
visiting attorneys’ and visiting

Special-topic seminars and con-
ferences will also be conducted
under the sponsorship of the law

Kirgis is currently professor

of law at the University of
California at Los Angeles,
where he has taught since 1973.
He was visiting professor of law
at W&L last autumn. He
assumes his new duties at
Washington and Lee Aug. 1, ac-
cording to Roy L. Steinheimer
Jr., dean of the W&L School of
Law, who announced Kirgis’ ap-
pointment.

The Frances Lewis Law
Center was established through
a $2-million endowment in 1972
from Frances and Sydney
Lewis of Richmond. Mr. and

Mrs. Lewis gave $9 million in all
to Washington and Lee’s law
program, $7 million of which

Legal Setting: Documents,
Comments and Questions,”’
published last year, and is cur-
rently working on a book on in-
ternational consultation,
scheduled for publication next
year. Kirgis has also written a
number of articles for law
reviews and other law journals.
He is a member of the executive
council of the American Society
of International Law and is ad-
mitted to practice before the
bars of California and the
District of Columbia.

Unlike many law centers, the
Frances Lewis Law Center will
not be limited to work in any
particular field but will focus on
developing knowledge ‘‘at the
frontiers of the law.”

Kirgis received his
undergraduate education at
Yale University and his law
degree from Berkeley. He was
an associate in the Washington,
D.C., law firm of Covington &
Burling, specializing in interna-
tional claims, prior to entering
teaching. He was a member of
the law faculty at the Universi-
ty of Colorado from 1967 until he
joined the UCLA law faculty
seven years later, and spent a
year’s leave of absence in
research study at the London
School of Economics.

McNider grilled on SCC

(continued from page 1)

heard by the full committee.
MeNider said about 98 percent
of the cases reported to the SCC
have come before the full com-
mittee.

Healy maintained that any
preliminary investigation
should be on a small scale to
minimize the committee’s time
expenditure and to ensure
fairness and impartiality.

The issue of preliminary in-
vestigations was an important
subject to the E.C. because of
the nature in which they have
been conducted this yeaV. It
came to light that McNider had
carried out the preliminary in-
vestigations of most SCC cases
by himself.

When making inquiries, it
was charged that McNider had
not told the accused: of his
rights. The chairman admitted
that he had not told those he had
investigated that they had the
right to say nothing. Three
honor vioiations have been
referred to the E.C. this year by
McNider. All were SCC cases
that he had investigated, but
which had not been heard by the
full committee. The E.C. voted
to hear two of the cases.

Document Altered

The preliminary investiga-
tion matter was also a part of a
controversy involving the SCC’s
‘Statement of the Purpose and
Procedures of the Student Con-
trol Committee.’’ The Ring-tum
Phi made available to the E. C.

copies of two different SCC

“‘statements.”’

The originally accepted pro-
cedure, dated September, 1977,
had specified that a complaint
of study misconduct would re-
quire a ‘‘majority vote of those
Committee members present”
to determine whether the SCC
would consider the complaint.
After describing the voting re-
quirements, the original state-
ment reads: ‘Upon a deter-
mination in favor of considera-
tion, the Committee shall
undertake sufficient investiga-

tion, including examination of_.

the student complained of, to
make a finding on the com-
plaint.”

Sometime in September,
McNider changed the pro-

DOUBLE TAKE BOOKS

cedure to read: ‘Upon receiv-
ing a complaint of alleged stu-
dent misconduct, the Chair-
man, or his appointed represen-
tative may undertake sufficient
investigation as is warranted. If
misconduct is indicated, a
member of the Committee shall
notify the student to appear
before the Committee at a
specified time. At that time the
Committee shall determine
whether to consider the com-
plaint.”” This revision was also
dated September, 1977.

Members of Student Control
said they had been unaware of
the change in procedure.

MeNider defended the change
by saying that, as far as he
knew, the chairman of Student
Control had always conduoted a
preliminary investigation of the
case before it was heard by the
committee.

MeNider’s critics have said
that he normally investigates
cases to a greater extert that he
should. E.C. representative
Healy argued that the commit-
tee as a whole should in-
vestigate the circumstances of
each case in the hearing.

MeNider said the procedural
change had been approved by
Dean Lewis John, although
there was some question
whether the Student Affairs

' Committee — the committee

which oversees the workings of
Student Control — had approv-
ed the change.

In an interview with the Ring-
tum Phi,Dean John, chairman
of the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, said that to his knowledge
the change had ‘“‘never been
submitted’’ to the SAC. “It has
not been the procedure for Stu-
dent Control to present their

own procedures for the ap-
proval of Student Affairs. 1°
assume Student Control ap- °
proves its own procedures,”’
Dean John said.

Jackie Boyden asked
MeNider point-black if he had
“ever made a student sign a
confession.”’ The problem ap-
parently arose in the case of a
freshman turned in to Student
Control for smoking marijuana
in the dormitories.

Although MeNider protested
the term ‘“‘confession,’’ he ad-
mitted that in a case last
September he had asked a stu-
dent to sign ‘‘a statement.”’
MeNider explained that there
had been manv contradictions
in the student’s testimony dur-
ing the preliminary investiga-
tion and that he had signed the
statement to verify information’
about the case.

Miss Boyden pointed out the
danger of having a signed ad-
mission of guilt when the act
committed is against state law.

MeNider agreed and said that
signed statements will not be
used the rest of the year by the
SCC.

It was also revealed that
McNider did not inform
students of their rights during
his preliminary investigations
— specifically, their right to not
answer his inquiries.

Jack Bovay, junior E.C.
representative, moved that tne
E.C. send a letter to the Student
Affairs Committee to request
that Student Control draw up ‘‘a
more clearly defined’’ state-
ment of procedures,
“specifically: the preliminary
investigation of a case; rights of
the accused; procedures during
the SCC investigation; and a
procedure for amending this
statement.”

The motion passed
unanimously. Three E.C.
members were absent from the
meeting: Doug Perkins, Mike
Missel, and Chris Gammon.

Other Action

In other action in the Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting:
—The Big Three Election (for
president, vice-president, and
secretary of the E.C.) will be
held March 13. Petitions of
students applying for con-
sideration in those positions are
due March 6.

—The election of class officers
will be held March 27. Petitions

_ for those positions are due

March 20. (The law school will
run its own election. )

—Bill Tucker, chairman of the
Student Activities Board, advis-
ed the E.C. that there will be 30
‘“‘doormen”’ at the Fancy Dress
Ball. He warned that the
decorations and the entire
building will be heavily policed.
—Grant Leister informed the
E.C. that the projected costs’ of
this year’s yearbook will be $810
above what was: originally
budgeted due to added: “‘color
work.” He said the cost could be
covered with the sale of four ad-
ditional pages of advertising.
Leister also said that the Sigma
Society owed the Calyx for two
years of coverage and would not
appear in the yearbook this
year unless _ pay $300 im-
_ Mediately.

Improve Your Reading . . . It’s Easy

con’t . from page 5
STEP 3—USE YOUR EYES
EFFICENTLY

The eyes see printed words
and transmit them to the brain.
They are the key to how well
you read.

Eyes perceive words only
when they stop moving or make
what is called a ‘‘fixation’’.
During the pause, the brain
registers what the eyes have
seen. Depending on your eye
span, you will preceive one, two
or more words in each fixation.
The average college student,
for example, has a span of 1.1
words and makes 4 fixations per
second. By increasing the
number or words your eyes in-
clude in each fixation, you in-
crease your reading speed.

Train your eyes to take in
more than one word at a time.
You can make your eyes fix on
related words, phrases, or short
lines in one brief stop. This
sentence, for example, should
be read in five fixations: ‘‘The
cost of oil/has risen/because
of/limited natural resources/
and increased imports.”

Vocalizing words, even in
your mind, slows down your
eyes. Don’t allow your eyes to
wander backward. Try not to
reread sentences. You will find
that you remember.more if you
can keep moving forward. This
does not mena, of course, that
you cannot review what you
have read.

Many people need glasses to
read well. Blurred words, con-
stantly tired or itching eyes are
singals for an eye examination.
Don’t put it off.

After you have surveyed your
reading habits for weak points,
set the scene for efficient
reading, and begin to work to in-
crease your eye span, there are
three additional steps to more
effective reading.

STEP 4—BROADEN YOUR
VOCABULARY

The person with a good grasp
of words is usually a good
reader and a good student. Your

vocabulary should continue to
grow throughout your lifetime.

Keep a dictionary handy,
whether you are reading for
pleasure or for work. Also use
the glossaries in your tex-
tbooks.

Make a list of new words. Jot
down unfamiliar words. Look
them up, and them make a point
of using them once or twice in
writing or in speech within the
next few days.

STEP 5—ADAPT YOUR
SPEED TO THE MATERIAL

Don’t expect to read
everything at the same rate. A
good reader balances speed
with comprehension.

Adjust your pace to your pur-
pose. You can’t expect to whiz
through a biology chapter at the
same rate you could read a light
novel.

Scan the material first. Form
the habit of glancing quickly at
headlines, chapter headings
and subheads. Look for main
ideas. Then decide which parts
you can skim and which will
need more careful reading.

When reading a text, first
survey the entire book. Look
over the table of contents,
chapter headings, and
subheads. Get an overview of
the author’s objectives by
reading the introduction or
preface.

Studying requires close
reading because you will need
to remember both the main
ideas and supporting details.
Underline major points as you
read. Make margin notes of
ideas that occur to you. After

you finish reading, glance back
over the entire chapter to see if
you grasped the key points.
STEP 6—PRACTICE
REGULARLY

Teading can be a lifelong
pleasure for those who read
with ease. Regular practice will
help you to do so.

Set aside 15 to 30 minutes dai-
ly to practice reading. Start
with fairly easy material and
short articles, such as ones in
Reader’s Digest. Your objec-
tive is to read with understan-
ding at your best speed.

Compare your _ present
reading speed with the follow-
ing averages. The speeds
generally accepted for average
readers are: easy-to-light
material, . 250-350 words per
minute (wpm); medium-to-
diffuclt material 200-250 wpm.

Time yourself for two pages
of easy-to-average material and
then compute your reading
speed. Next, ask yourself some
questions about what you have
just read. If you missed impor-
tant details, your speed was
probably too fast for your pre-
sent reading ability.

Read three or four easy-to-
average articles each day for
two or three weeks. Make
yourself go a little faster, but
not so much that you miss key
points. Record your speed.

Switch to more difficult
material for another two or
three weeks of practice. After
six weeks you should have in-
creased your speed and com-
prehension considerably.

Aim for a speed on easy

material of about 300 wpm. At
that rate, you are doing as well
as the average good reader.

Maintain the habit by reading
at least a half hour a day.

The pleasure and benefits of
reading make it a rewarding
hobby throughout life. You will
be enriched by keeping up with
newspapers, magazines and
books. You will also enjoy more
as your proficiency increases
and will be continually adding
to your knowledge.
