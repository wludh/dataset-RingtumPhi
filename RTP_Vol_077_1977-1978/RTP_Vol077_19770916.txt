SAB under fire ;
Records burned

by Lee Howard

The Student Activities Board
in the past academic year made
unauthorized expenditures, in-
cluding a $175 loan to this year’s
SAB co-chairman Charlie
Hulfish, Rick Goddard will
charge at the first Executive
Committee meeting on Monday.

Goodard, senior E.C. law
representative, said he was not
able to prove what he thinks
were more massive unauthoriz-
ed expenditures because when
he went to find last year’s SAB
receipts they were all missing.
He said a source within the SAB
told him the receipts were all
burned at the end of the past
academic year.

One voucher he was able to
find, which is now in the posses-
sion of the Ring-tum Phi is for a
“‘loan for housing — pay back in
two weeks.” The loan was made
March 9. According to Goddard,
the loan has yet to be paid back.
The check voucher was signed
by last year’s co-chairman John
Berley. :

Goddard said he is going to
suggest to the E.C. that Hulfish
be required to pay back the loan
within two weeks with interest.
If he did not repay the loan in
that time Goddard said he

- -§$hould be sued.

THE HECKMAN BINDERY, INC.

| Besides unauthorized
jisbursements of money, God-
jard said the SAB mismanged
the money they had. According
to his source, the SAB often left
thousands of dollars overnight

in the SAB office, said Goddard.
Goddard said his source also
told him that one night a drunk
SAB member left about $2,000 in
the trunk of his car.

The SAB also kept inadequate
records, according to Goddard.
Movie receipts and grain party
receipts were either not record-
ed or, if recorded, were not done
on a daily basis, said Goddard.
As a result, there were reports
of stealing, he said.

In order for the E.C. to con-
trol SAB money more tightly,
Goddard is going to propose at
Monday’s E.C. meeting that the
Committee put restrictions on
the money they give out. God-
dard said SAB- members had
private parties regularly at the
student fund’s expense. Yet the
E.C. only authorizes money for
one party; a party just before
Fancy Dress.

Goddard will also propose
that a person be appointed to
each student group to oversee
the expenditure of Executive
Committee money. He said that
many of the checks written by
the SAB last year were personal
checks written to SAB co-
chairman Mike Armstrong and
Berley. These checks were sup-
posedly for ‘“‘incidental’’ ex-
penses, however many of these
checks were for over $100, God-
dard said. Since the receipts
were burned, it is impossible to
tell what really happened to the
money, he said. This is why
Goddard is going to make his
suggestion.

School reopens

by Rex Nyquist

Washington and Lee began its
228th year of undergraduate
education yesterday when
slasses opened. Harold Head,
University Registrar, reported
that 1,690 students had
matriculated as of yesterday
morning. Of these, 304 ‘were
enrolled in the Law School.

William J. Watt, Dean of the
College, said that the goal of the
college remains the same: ‘‘To
provide a good liberal arts
education on the undergraduate
level.”

In pursuing this goal to pro-
vide a solid undergraduate
education, the University faces
several challenges, and is mak-
ing some significant changes.
Among the most obvious of the
challenges is the completion of
the undergraduate library

Returning students noticed
the headway made on the con-
struction of the library,
scheduled for completion in
1980. In addition, the University

   

must raise $650,000 to pay for
the library. To date, the Univer-
sity has raised $8.1 million of
the $9 million necessary to pay
for the construction. A $250,000
Challenge Grant from the
Kresge Foundation of Michigan
means that the university must

Co-Op $80,000 in red

by Heartsill Ragon

Information related to the
Ring-tum Phi by recently-fired
Co-Op manager James E. Toler
has revealed that’ the
Washington and Lee University
Supply Store and Co-Op have
been operating at an approx-
imated $80,000 deficit for the
past four years.

Toler, who was relieved of his
duties as manager of the enter-
prise last spring, reported to the
RtP in a telephone interview
that auditors last year informed
him of annual Co-Op losses of
$20,000.

Toler added that the ‘auditors
said some of these annual profit
losses could be attributed to
pilferage.

According to sources and
rumors around the Co-Op, bla-
tant cases of student as well as
“towny”’ pilferage in the Supply
Store area have gone
unreported and uncontrolled.

Realizing the presence of Co-
Op thievery, Toler said that
several years ago he submitted
a plan to W&L Treasurer
James W. Whitehead that would
increase Supply Store security
while also boosting Co-Op effi-
ciency. New Co-Op manager
Jerry Darrell, during the sum-

mer months, had a partition
built similar to the idea sug-
gested by Toler.

Toler, who lives in Roanoke
and commuted to Washington
and Lee during his eight years
of employment, added that he
believed the primary reason he
was asked to resign by
Whitehead was so that the
University could eliminate his
$10,500 annual salary.

Darrell, manager of Evans
Dining Hall, was chosen to
relieve Toler and take charge of
W&L’s newly created Food Ser-
vice Department.

Darrell said the purpose of
this new partition was two-fold:
first, he said, it was built for
security (I didn’t like the idea of

- it being wide open at night’’),

secondly, and as an _ after-
thought, the new partition was
constructed as a merchandising
aid. Darrell said the added wall
space could be used for display
purposes and thus make the
merchandise more appealing.
“It’s difficult to understand
how an operation with as much
traffic and volume couldn't

break even,’’ Whitehead said.
Contrary to Darrell’s reports

of minimal pilferage from out-

side of the W&L community,

Whitehead said, “Ever since
I’ve been treasurer at W&L,
and even before, I’ve never
heard of an item from that area

being stolen.”

Whitehead said that the new
partition, which to many up-
perclassmen seems like Honor
Code hypocracy, was in no way
connected to security but was
for managerial and merchan-
dising purposes only. ‘‘I don’t
want it to be an expense to the
school where cutbacks have to
take place in other school
areas,’’ Whitehead said.

When asked about the
reported Co-Op deficjts,
Whitehead declined to comment
but said ‘‘...the operation was

not self supporting.’’
Whitehead said the new
partitioned-off Supply Store

could be closed and locked dur-
ing the off-business hours and
thus the University could be
freed of some part-time’
employment burden.

Food services updated

Co-Op cafeteria opens

by Joe Dashiell

In an attempt to consolidate
all food services under one
management, Washington and
Lee has placed the student Co-
Op under the direction of Jerry
Darrell, manager of both Evans
Dining Hall and the Cockpit.
Though only in charge of the Co-
Op for a short while, Mr. Dar-
rell has already made signifi-
cant changes in the snack bar
area. These changes are design-

culate in preparation for school opening.

ed to expedite service without a
loss in food quality.

The most striking feature of
the new arrangement is the
cafeteria-style line. The line
creates an order to service and
at the same time emphasizes
self-service. These factors com-
tine to increase the efficiency of
the women working behind the
counter. Mr. Darrell expects
this new arrangement to in-
crease the volume of customers
by twenty to thirty per cent.

The menu has experienced
minor changes. A few of the less
popular items have been drop-
ped along with those that were
not practical in a cafeteria ar-
rangement. Mr. Darrell has ad-
ded a few items including
salads and a breakfast selection
similar to McDonald’s Egg
McMuffin. As soon as_ the
weather becomes cooler, he
also plans to add hot soup to the
menu. Prices have fallen on
nine items and risen on only
three.

The methods of service have
changed significantly with the
new system. Items like ham-
burgers will be prepared ap-
proximately ten minutes in ad-

vance and placed under a heat

Cockpit plans
more
entertainment

The Cockpit will undergo
several changes this year which
assistant manager Burr Datz
hopes will give it ‘more of a
social atmosphere.”’

Datz says in past years the
Cockpit was a ‘‘catch-all hole.”
He says he hopes the changes
that he and manager Jerry Dar-
rell implement will give the
Cockpit ‘‘more class.”

Perhaps the most significant
change will be the addition of a
stage for live entertainment.
Datz says he expects that live
entertainment will become a
regular Cockpit feature. In
order for this to happen, though,
the Cockpit will have to find
talented student bands and solo
acts. For this reason Datz urges
all persons interested in per-
forming to contact either
himself, Darrell, day super-
visor Francis Davis or night
manager Dan Scott.

In addition to the new stage,
Datz hopes to acquire more
powerful speakers for the per-
formers. Also, Datz intends to
change the tunes in the juke box
either monthly or twice-
monthly.

Farm House Donated

Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Cheek,
Jr. of Richmond have given
‘“‘Skylark’’—their 365-acre
mountaintop estate and
Christmas tree farm on the
Blue Ridge Parkway in Nelson
County—to Washington and Lee
University.

The gift is in memory of the
late Douglas Southall Freeman,
Mrs. Cheek’s father. Dr.
Freeman, biographer of George
Washington and Robert E. Lee,
was editor of the Richmond
News Leader from 1915 to 1949.
His four-volume “‘R. E. Lee’,
for which he won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1935, remains the stan-
dard biography of Lee. He was
again awarded the Pulitzer,
posthumously, in 1958 for his
definitive biography of
Washington. He received an
honorary.Doctor of Law degree
from W&L in 1919.

Cheek was director of the
Virginia Museum of. Fine Arts
from 1948 until his retirement in
1969, the year he and Mrs.
Cheek began construction of
“Skylark.” Cheek, a graduate
in Fine-arts history at Harvard
University and in architecture
at Yale, drew the plans, chose
the materials, and supervised
construction of this ‘‘Village.”’

W&L will operate Skylark in
the same way the Cheeks did,
with a resident manager and
with the university’s Director of
projects spending a portion of
histimetherealso.  -

In addition to its continuing
function as a private farm,
Skylark will also be used for
small meetings, forums, and
similar functions, involving
W&L groups; scholars plans
for using Skylark ‘‘creatively”
will be under study throughout
the coming academic year, ac-
cording to W&L_ president
Robert E. R. Huntley.

The central cluster of
buildings constructed by the
Cheeks at Skylark consists of a
main house with a guest apart-
ment; a guest house; a two-
level ‘barn’ which is, in fact,
the manager’s residence; a
stable; and work shops.

The area is landscaped and
has a small garden. At a
distance from the residences
are a small lake, a tennis court,
and a pavilion for picnicking.

Shortly after they purchased
the land in the mid-1960’s and
before they began construction
of the village, the Cheeks
planted their first crop of 1500
Christmas trees. There are now

ten plantations of Christmas
trees on the farm.

The Cheeks’ gift to W&L in-
cludes the furnishings in . the
house and all the farm equip-
ment.

According to Huntley, “It
simply is not possible to
overstate Skylark’s majesty.
The Cheeks took what is,
without question, one of the
most beautiful natural locations
in Virginia, and did what one
might have thought would not
be possible. With unfailing taste
and elegance, they made it
more beautiful.”’

New
Writing
Test

by Randy Smith

Last Wednesday, for the first
time, all entering freshmen
were required to compose an
essay testing their writing abili-
ty. Theessay was based on
questions concerning assigned
summer reading books, also a
new innovation this year.

The one-hour and 45-minute
examination involved a choice
of one of four education-related
topics, demanding a 400 word
demonstration of prose style.
Although most questions dealt
with varying aspects of the
summer reading, a primarily
philosophical question was add-
ed for those who were not ade-
quately familiar with the
reading material.

The testing came about as a
compromise of three faculty
suggestions: 1) that some sort
of written exam be given to
evaluate writing proficiency ; 2)
freshmen should be given a
summer reading list of from six
to eight books; and 3) that a
greater emphasis be given to
academics during freshman
orientation week. Dean
Huntley, associate dean of
students, hopes that the testing
will enable administrators to
spot those freshmen with
writing difficulties more easily
than in the past.

Essay examinations are
designed to test writing ability,
clarity, and organization.
Students found to have difficul-
ty in any of these areas will be
advised to take a basic writing
skills course. Dean Huntley
stressed that there would be no
obligation to take a basic skills
course, but that for those to
whom it is recommended, such
a course might be important for
future academic success at
Washington and Lee.

SAB Loses Co-Chairman

by Fraser Humphreys

The senior year at
Washington and Lee is a sacred
thing indeed. In some ways it’s
the long-awaited pay off after
three years of inching up the
academic ladder, adjusting to
the unique challenge of ‘“‘the
road’’ and mastering the ‘‘W&L
swing” in general. The position
of a rising senior in good stan-
ding and three-fourths of the
way through is to be admired.

The position of a rising senior
such as Doug Jackson who
possessed all three attributes as
well as the cochairmanship of
the SAB borders on enviable.

Jackson, however, chose not
to return to W&L this year and
opted instead for a year’s leave
of absence to remain home in
Atlanta and work full time for
“the friendship force.”’

The ‘Friendship Force” is a
privately-funded program of
goodwill ambassadors sent
from the United States to

foreign countries tor the simple
purpose of cementing interna-
tional friendship, according to
U. S. News and World Report’s
September 19 issue, which
features a picture of Jackson.
The Friendship Force idea was
originated by President Carter
in 1973 and naturally is now
heavily plugged by the Presi-
dent. He explains, “I want to
see the ties of our country with
other foreign countries—large
and small, powerful and weak.

The Natural Bridge Experience

The 357 freshmen this year at
Natural Bridge had to do
without the traditional Mock
Honor trial that entering
freshmen in the past were
treated to. According to Dr.
James Worth, ‘‘The mock honor
trial did not do a good job of
presenting what the honor
system is truly about. The
honor system is not a farce, as it

may have been interpreted.

from the presentation in the
past. Rather it is something
that is very desirable, and
something to be very proud of.”’
This year the emphasis was on
the ideals of the honor system
instead of the judicial aspects of
the system.

The Natural Bridge festivities
were M.C.’ed by Worth who in-
troduced a variety of speakers
which included Lexington
Mayor Charles Phillips, W&L
Food Services Manager Jerry
Darrell, Dean of Students Lewis
John, and Head of Security
Charles Murray.

Other speakers were Steve
Trigg, who gave a talk on the
Galapagos Islands expedition;
Rick Stein for the University
Federation; Michael Cleary for
the ROTC program; and finally
Dean Sprunt who introduced the
local clergymen. After the
scheduled program ended, the
freshmen were invited to stay
and hear talks from various
organizations on campus which
included the RtP, Mock Conven-
tion, IFC, Contact and others.

Cockpit
(continued from page 1)

Some changes have already
been implemented. The back of
the bar has been redecorated,
and there are new lights behind
the bar. In addition, the Cockpit
is now selling 46 and 32 oz.
glasses of beer as a ‘‘gimmick,”’
says Datz. Larger pitchers of
beer are also being sold now
and can be guzzled down in new
pilsner glasses.

In order to promote the

‘new’ Cockpit, any woman
with a college identification
card will be able to purchase
her ‘‘favorite cold beverage”’ at
half price between Sept. 15-25,
says Datz. In addition, there
will be two happy hours every
week: Wednesday, from 8-9
p.m., and Thursday, from 4-6
p.m.
The idea behind these
changes is to make the: Cockpit
into a ‘Student Center
Tavern,” Datz said. At night the
“tavern” will be fully equipped
with a bouncer, who will check
identification at the side door of
the Cockpit. The front doors will
be closed at night to keep
alcoholic beverages from being
taken out of the Cockpit.

Datz says he hopes the
Cockpit’s change of’ image,
which really started when Dar-
rell consolidated the menu last
year, will draw more fraternity
people He hopes the Cockpit
can compete favorably with
‘‘going down the road”’ by draw-
ing females to the Cockpit with
live entertainment.

The freshmen then took a
break to play softball, meet
each other, and escape the
tedium of the afternoon
meetings. After dinner a class
meeting was held which was
M.C.’ed by Ms. Betty Munger
who introduced Dr. I. T.
Sande:’s, university historian,
who gave a talk on heritage and
tradition at W&L. Sanders was
followed by student body presi-
dent Jim Underhill and vice-
president George Griffin who
gave the presentation on the
honor system.

After the evening session, the

     

Frosh josh during rush

freshmen broke up into 8-10
groups to discuss the honor
system, and to sample beer
from the ten kegs provided by
the Executive Council.

After breakfast Friday, a
class meeting was held with
various professors and students
representing the different
departments on campus
available to talk to the
freshmen about their respective
departments. Following lunch,
the much enlightened and seat-
sore freshmen returned to cam-
pus prepared to take on the
world.

Lewis Hall Photos
Tour Country

An exhibition of photographs
by Lexington photographer Sal-
ly Mann will open at the Cor-
coran Gallery of Art,
Washington, D. C., next Satur-
day (Sept. 24).

The exhibit will consist
primarily of Mann’s ‘Lewis
Hall Portfolio,’ 25 black-and-
white photographs taken during
construction of Washington and
Lee University’s new law
building beginning in 1974. She
is Washington and Lee’s chief
staff photographer as well as a
free-lance professional
photographer.

The photos in the Corcoran
exhibit are abstract and semi-
abstract views that were in-
spired by the shapes and
materials at the construction
site, she says.

Prints from the Lewis Hall
series are included in several
important public and private
collections, including those of
Joseph Hirshhorn and_ the
Polaroid Corp. ‘Lewis Hall
Portfolio” has been exhibited
previously in New York City
and after leaving the Corcoran
will be shown at galleries in
New Orleans and Carmel, Calif.

The prestigious Ferguson
Grant of the Friends of
Photography Society in Carmel
supported Mann’s Lewis Hall
project.

She is a B.A. and M.A.
graduate of Hollins College and
has been associated with
Washington and Lee since 1974.
In addition to her duties as
photographer, she is curator of
W&L’s 10,000-plate collection of

late-19th- and  early-20th-
century photographs’ by
Michael Miley, ‘Robert E.
Lee’s Photographer.”’

She was a co-founder of
‘“‘Image Continuum,’’ a
limited-edition photographers’
journal which gained con-
siderable attention in the mid-
1970s.

Mann is one of the few
Americans currently working
in platinum photography, using
intricate turn-of-the-century
methods. Because of its cost,
platinum has been replaced
almost exclusively by silver in
photo print-making. Platinum,
however, produces a_ soft,
velvet-like image, beige to
sepia in tone, ‘‘like a finely
detailed etching,” she says.

Her husband, Larry Mann, is
a blacksmith in Lexington, and
his Woods Creek Forge is wide-
ly known for its ornamental
ironwork. The Manns are co-
owners of a solar-energy com-
pany as well.

At the Corcoran, her Lewis
Hall photographs will be shown
together with black-and-white
photos by Mike Mitchell, a
Washington free-lance
photographer who teaches at
the Corcoran. His ‘‘romantic-
mystical’ photos depict the
“hallowed grounds” of the
Washington Cathedral and Arl-
ington National Cemetery.

A catalogue with an introduc-
tion by Jane Livingston, curator
of the Corcoran, is being
published in connection with the
show.

The exhibition continues
through Nov. 13.

New Library On Time

by Ned McDonnell

The men, clad in hard hats
and workclothes, scurry around
the five-story skeleton trying to
make up for lost time from last
winter’s frigid temperatures.
With only one day lost to rain all
summer, the construction crew
from Bass Construction out of
Richmond, through remarkable
progress, has_ nearly
counteracted the strong devia-
tion from the ‘Critical Path’ last
winter.

The ‘Critical Path’, a time
schedule for construction pro-
jects developed by Systems
Project Management, Inc. of
Atlanta, takes into account all
facets, variables, and possible
external pressures. The plotting
of the critical path helps dif-
ferent sub-contractors deter-
mine what to do and when to do
it so that the project can pro-
gress smoothly.

Aside from the fluctuations
around the critical path, the
financial side of the project is
fine. With some cost-cutting
measures adopted by the
University, such as changing
over from the ultra-expensive
white cement to the more
economical gray cement, the
contractors are well in the
black. But, as Scott Beebe,
W&L liaison with the project
stated, unknown variables

creating new difficulties could
quickly dry up the surplus.

And what is all this haggling
over the dollar column and
sweating under the sun going to
produce? Our new library.
Supposedly due in August 1978,
Beebe and co-worker Rick
Parker agree that Christmas
1978 is a more realistic arrival
date for the edifice.

The five-floor library, com-
plete with an auditorium and
three elevators, will sit in the
side of the hill directly behind
Washington Hall. Passing
through the mall which will be
pitted between the library and
the colonade, one will enter the
main level atop four other
levels. The main level and
lower level number one will
face Washington Hall while all
five levels will face Wood's
Creek. Along the outer walls of
each level will be study carrels
and offices with the bookstacks
lying in the central region of
each level.

The library will resemble the
new law school. Marcellus,
Wright, Cox, and Laid of Rich-
mond, architects of Lewis Hall,
designed this new haven for
higher learning. The concept of
this building typifies the strong
desire of the University to com-
bine the past and the present for
a better academic community.

New Numbers Man

Robert Stanley Johnson, pro-
fessor of mathematics at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, has been named to a five-
year term as head of that
department. His new appoint-
ment becomes effective Sept. 1.

Johnson succeeds Robert A.
Roberts, who completes his
five-year term as department
head this year.

In addition, the W&L board of

Busy UT Season Ahead

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

The W&L University Theatre
has announced its schedule of
shows for the new. academic
year—and it is a program full
and.diverse. Making the most
use possible of their two
playhouses, the Troubadour
(corner Main & Henry Streets)
and the Boiler Room (across
Main St. in the Old Main Mall),
the season will include a pro-
gram abroad in the spring while
boosting the number of shows
presented here at W&L to a new
high of seven.

At a glance, the fall term pro-
gram looks as follows... The
season opener will be a produc-
tion of the classic Greek
tragedy, ‘‘Oedipus Rex,”’
directed by Lee Kahn in the
Boiler Room. In the words of
the director, “The main em-
phasis in this show will not be
the usual one of period costume
and makeup to achieve a sense
of time. Rather, we will dwell
on the rhytm and the irony of
the production.’’ The show will
be holding open auditions within
the next two weeks, to: which
any and all interested students
and staff are encouraged to at-
tend. As in previous years, the
UT’s policy is to serve as a
training ground for theatre ma-
jors, but at the same time, to
provide an activity for all
students.

The second major production
this fall will be directed by a se-
cond member of the drama
faculty—Al Gordon, directing
the 18th century comedy
‘Beaux Strategem.” And com-
pleting the line-up for fall will
be a one-night return per-
formance in November, by the
Mime Company of the Warsaw
Chamber Opera, bringing their
new inventions to. the
Troubadour. The highly ac-
claimed troupe was warmly
received last year, for a six-
week program of performing
and teaching.

Winter term will include an
unprecedented three major
productions—all in_ the
Troubadour—while student-
directed one acts will be shown
regularly in the Boiler Room.
The opener is Eugene O’Neill’s
“Desire Under The Elms,”
directed as a Senior Thesis Pro-
ject by Chris Willett, and the
first major O’Neill play to be
presented on this campus in 14
years. Following it will be the
second Senior Thesis Project in
directing, ‘‘The Ritz’ directed

by Barry Godin. And rounding
out the winter collection will be
another production directed by
Professor Kahn, ‘‘‘Butley,’’ the
modern English drama _ by
Simon Gray.

The six-week spring term of-
fers students a unique op-
portunity to take the drama-
abroad program in London, and
become totally immersed in the
subject. London is the usual
destination of this group, for in
the words of one of them, ‘‘The
city simply has more good
theatre productions per square
foot than anywhere else in the
world, including New
York...and the prices for tickets
are quite a bit more
reasonable.”’ Anyone who is in-
terested in information concer-
ning this program—costs, size
of group, and the like—are re-
quested to call Lee Kahn at the
Troubadour as soon as possible,
at 463-9111, Ext. 371.

But, for those whose interests
remain here in Lexington, plans
go on for a full program here at
W&L, in the Total Theatre
course. This year under the
charge of Al Gordon, the
theatre has yet to come to a
final decision regarding choice
of plays, but prominent in con-
sideration have been the com-
edies of Kaufmann and Hart,
and other modern American
comedies.

This year has a smaller
number of senior majors doing
special projects than usual, but
the three who are seniors this
year have a wide range of ex-
pertise, working in virtually all

areas of drama. Chris Willett,
House Manager of the UT last
year, has acted in plays such as
last year’s ‘Dr. Faustus.” In
addition, Chris has already
worked as the Assistant Direc-
tor on two major shows, last
year’s “Threepenny Opera”
and ‘Barefoot in the Park.”
Barry Godin is an acting
regular at UT, and has combin-
ed this with working as Stage
Manager for such shows as
“The.Tempest” and W&L’s
much-acclaimed _ presentation
of ‘‘1776.”’

The third and final senior ma-
jor, Warren Mowry, has chosen
his thesis concentration in ac-
ting. No stranger to the techni-
que, Warren has played major
roles consistently, beginning
with his first part of the Mayor
in ‘‘The Visit.’’ Other roles have
included Col. McKean in ‘‘1776”
and, of course, Willy Loman in
last spring’s ‘‘Death of a
Salesman.” His one-man show
will be centered on playing the
character of Clarence Darrow.

So, another season is on the
verge of starting, and the time
to say a few words about ticket
operations. They are free for all
members of the W&L com-
munity, but reservations are
necessary before each show.
The box office number is
463-9111, Ext. 371, and as before
all tickets must be picked up 24
hours in advance or they will be
redistributed. The Ring-Tum
Phi wishes the UT the best of
luck for another successful
year.

 

THE NOSE

Halleleujah it’s over and time
to get back into the swing of
things. Have you ever gone
through a summer like the past
one? The campus was a mess.
Of course not much more could
be expected short of absolute
chaos with a certain Dean’s son
running around with more keys
than the warden of Alcatraz.
What in God’s name is he still
doing around here. I thought he
graduated three years ago.
“Flesh” is gone, to some peo-
ple’s joy, others’ sorrow. The
question is, will he ever pay the
hundreds of dollars in library
fines he owes? Rumor has it
that a certain member of SAB is
eyeing for his old jobs. Dean
Diddle has a new assistant. He’s
an old Wash. Hall man

SAB Fall Movies Announced

Glen Stanford and Steve
Mangan, Co-Chairmen of the
SAB Film Subcommittee, have
announced their schedule for
the fall term to be presented in
DuPont Hall. Further coverage
of each movie will follow in the
Ring-Tum Phi’s subsequent
issues. All movies listed are to
be presented at 7 & 9, unless

specified otherwise...
“The Graduate,’’ Sept. 16-18;
“Seven Ups,’ Sept. 23-25;

‘Lawrence of Arabia’ (at 6 &
10), Sept. 30-Oct. 2; ‘‘Hang ““Em

High,” Oct. 14-16; ‘‘State of the
Union,” Oct. 21-23; ‘‘Oliver!’’,
Oct. 28-30 (at 6:30 & 9—
Parents’ Weekend)...

Also, ‘“‘The Out-of-Towners,”’
Nov. 4-6; ‘“Dog Day Afternoon,”
Nov. 11-13 (at 6:30 & 9); “‘The
Three Musketeers,” Nov. 18-20;

ther,’’ Dec. 2-4.

Slots for next term’s movies
are still open...Anyone with sug-
gestions, please contact the
SAB in the University Center.

the real world for two years and
now is back at W&L. Proof that
W&L does not prepare you for
the business world. It only
prepares you to be a Dean at
small conservative men’s col-
leges in the south.

The SAB was quite shaken up
a bit early in Sept. It seems
Doug Jackson had to leave the
country for South America very
suddenly, which left a vacant
seat in the chairmanship of the
SAB, A very small person on the
SAB is very excited, because he
actually thinks the EC will ap-
point him as co-chairperson
with Mr. Hulfish.

Speaking of the Co-Op. What
in the world is J. D. trying to
do? Gone are the days when
Fanny would shout (in a
whisper) ‘‘two eggs with ham.”
Now we have Egg McQuick. I
hope J. D. isn’t trying to get a
patent on it. The only federal
agency interested is The Center
for Disease Control. Gone also
is the Dynamic Duo of Hair
Spray Henrietta and Teasing
Tesse from the Supply Store. Do
you ever get the feeling what
this campus will look like when
we come back for our reunion?

Well that’s all the nose knows
for now. If you hear any news
put it on a piece of hoagie paper
and slide it under the Ring- tum-
Phi office door of the Student

Annie Hall

by Seth Oserin

“Annie Hall,’’ appearing at
the Lyric this week, is Woody
Allen’s follow-up to ‘The
Front’’—a production which in-
troduced a total change in
Allen’s presentation and style.

The plot involves the study of
the relationship between a ris-
ing young comedian (Woody
Allen), and an insecure, im-
mature Annie Hall (Diane
Keaton). We are witness to the
development of attitudes in the
relationship, as well as develop-
ment of the personalities of the
respective characters.

Anyone who has yet to see
‘The Front’’, would undoubted-
ly be surprised at Allen’s latest
thesis. His toned-down style
concentrates more on the
significance of comedy to the
script, rather than the im-
mediate, face value impact on

the audience. Allen uses his
usual cleverness in attaining
this goal, such as his use of
solicited opinions from total
non-entities. These opinions are
used to help him make decisions
on his private life. (The amaz-
ing thing is that everyone knows
about his “‘private’’ life, and
talks as though they’ve been
watching the whole affair on
“Days of Our Lives.’’) Thus,
this more subtle style of com-
edy has won over many a
Woody Allen critic.

Diane Keaton does a fine job
transforming the character of
Annie Hall through her various
personality changes (which is
the eventual reason for the ter-
mination of the relationship).

All of the above considered,
this is definitely one of Allen’s
winners (did he ever lose?)
and is especially recommended
to those who consider Allen and
his usual comedy an _ un-
fortunate reincarnation from
the dark ages.

Aerial attempts to upgrade image

by Parker Potter

Ariel. To most people Ariel,
like lacrosse, frisbees and tub-
ing signals the start of Spring at
Washington and Lee. Unlike the
above activities, Ariel enjoys
somewhat less visibility than
those tiny little boll weevils who
fill your mouth with cotton after
a long evening of mint julips.
This year there will be an at-
tempt to upgrade (create?) the
image which Ariel seems to
lack.

The first major innovation is
the shift from a plea for
manuscripts to be slipped under
some door. Rather, I hope to in-
crease both quality and quanti-
ty of contributions by working
directly with the people who
write. My goal is to make Ariel

Auditions for the W&L Glee
Club have been announced for
this week, under

the direction of Dr. Gordon:

Spice of the music department.
They will be held in the Mu Beta
Psi (music fraternity) room in
the basement of the University
Center. All interested students
are invited to try out. If there
are any further questions,
please contact Dr. Spice.

Spanish Theatre

Four short theatrical pieces
in Spanish will be presented in
Washington and Lee. Universi-
ty’s Troubadour Theatre next
Monday (Sept. 19) at 7:30 p.m.

The pieces will be performed
by Servando Carballar and
Carmen Heymann. Their tour
of the United States is spon-
sored by the Spanish Foreign
Ministry. Washington and Lee
is their first tour performance,,

The visit to Washington and
Lee is sponsored by the Spanish
department. The performance
is free and the public is invited
both to the performance and to
a reception afterwards in
Washington and Lee’s Alumni
House.

a writer’s magazine. I feel that
the prospect of contributing
ideas as well as manuscripts is
much more stimulating than
the idea of slipping a poem to
some anonymous editor.

When I took over as editor of
Ariel, it was my contention that
there is far more creative talent
at Washington and Lee than a
perusal of Ariel would seem to
indicate. I want to bring that

talent to Ariel.

To that end there will be a
meeting some time next week to
get together and bat some ideas
around.

Anyone interested in working
on Ariel this year is asked to
contact Parker Potter at Pi
Kappa Phi, 463-2750 or 463-4532
or at home, 463-2334. A meeting
time will be worked out.

 

Changes in Coop Building—
yes. Reorganization and some
rearranging but the basic idea
of a center of community life
still remains. The Bookstore
has expanded its baliwick to in-
clude textbocks and records.
However, the organized chaos
still survives. We continue to be
dedicated to the fine art of
browsing. .

At the ~ ment everyone’s
mind is on . .tbooks. Our goal
is to have a book on the shelves
for every student who wants to
buy one the day classes start.
It’s a form of Russian roulette,
but we hope the number of pro-
blems will be small and not too
nerve-wracking for faculty and
students (to say nothing of
Bookstore personnel).

Textbooks are _ shelved
alphabetically by course and
numerically within the course.
Books may be returned for
refunds (on approval of the
manager) only if the course is
cancelled, the course is dropped
(drop slip needed) or the wrong
book has been purchased.

At the moment the Bookstore
is cashing checks for students
as a part of the superb service
which we give. The limit per
check is $20 and there will be a
charge for bounces.

On to more cheerful matters:
50 copies of the new J. R. R.
Tolkien book, The Silmarillion
arrived in the Bookstore a week

 

Eve and Ear:
from the Bookstore

before publication and almost

all are sold. Seventyfive _

copies came in this morning. So
Middle Earth rises to the top of
the best-seller world again.

 

Special news from the record
shop:

As you all probably know we
do have a record shop—and it’s
very alive and well. In fact I
think you’ll find us most ac-
commodating. We will be glad
to special order any record not
in stock that you want at no ex-
tra cost. In addition to the
largest selection of classical

‘LP’s in the area, you will also

find our pop-rock and jazz selec-
tions are good. We are up-to-

date but also stock many old].

classics.

Along other lines, this year
we will have full lines of audio
equipment available by order at
excellent prices for you. This
combined with selections of
blank tape and our everyday
lowest prices in town give you
the best deal you can find for
music in the area.

Please stop in. We are under
the Bookstore. Come and
browse, ask questions, and
listen to tunes. In addition there
will be a column appearing here
regularly keeping you up-to-
date on what we feel are the
best of the new releases...Come
by and smile.

Dupont Gallery
Opening

W&L’s University art gal-
lery will re-open with a pub-
lic reception on the evening
of September 19, next Monday,
announced department head Al

Gordon. Featuring wine and

cheese, and open to all students,

faculty, and staff of the univer-
sity, this is an all-new way of
kicking off a full year of exhibi-

tions.
The works in the gallery are

those of Bruce Gagnier. They
will be available for viewing
from next Monday’s reception
(at 7 til 9 p.m.) through October
7. Gagnier, a resident of New
Jersey, has also done some
work at Haverford College in
Pennsylvania. All the displayed
works will be paintings, par-
human

ticularly’ of frontal

figures. Gagnier’s technique is
especially interesting, as he
utilizes wax, benzene, and oil
paint in production.

For those unable to come to
next Monday night’s special
showing, the gallery will also be
open during the week between
its regular hours of 9 until 4. Of
course, there is no admission
charge.

The gallery calendar is
already full for this academic
year, with 8 exhibitions by out-
side artists. In addition, each
senior art major will present his
own personal showing, and the
studio art students will join
their talents in an ensemble ex-
hibit later in the year. Further
details on later events will be
released by the gallery.

Faculty
Accomplishments

A new, substantially revised
version of a_ college-level
geology textbook written by the
head of Washington and Lee
University’s geology depart-
ment has just been published.

The second edition of “In-
troduction to the Structure of
the Earth,” by Edgar W.
Spencer, was released this spr-
ing by McGraw Hill. The book
was first issued in 1969,

The text is designed for use in

structural geology courses in
which the emphasis is on basic
principles. Topics covered in-
clude selected aspects of
regional structural geology, the
Structure of ocean basins, the
earth’s interior, and tectonics
(the study of changes in the ear-
th’s crust).

Spencer is a 1953 physics
graduate of Washington and
Lee. He received his Ph.D. in
geology from Columbia Univer-
sity in 1957, the year he joined
the W&L faculty. He became
head of the department in 1959

at the age of 28.

He is the author of four other
college textbooks in geology:
“The Dynamics of the Earth”
(1972), ‘‘Geology: A Survey of
(1965), and
“Basic Concepts of Historical
Geology”’ and “‘Basic Concepts
(both

Earth Science”’

of Physical Geology”’
1962).

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has taken two awards for
photography in the annual com-
petition sponsored by the Coun-
cil for Advancement and Sup-

port of Education (CASE).

The awards were for a port-
folio of 12 photos by Sally Mann,
the professional photographer
in Lexington who is also W&L’s
chief staff photographer, and
for a separate portfolio of
photos by ~ others, including
students, three fromer universi-
ty photographers, and other

W&L officials.

The two W&L awards were
among 50 announced by CASE
this week. They were chosen
from more than 700 entries, the

organization said.

Lawrence D. Gaughan, pro-
fessor of law at the Washington
and Lee University School of
Law, was appointed chairman
of a National Council on Family
Relations task force this sum-
mer. He will study special men-
tal health concerns in national
health insurance.

Gaughan, president of the
Rockbridge-Buena Vista Bar
Association, has written an arti-
cle with Washington and Lee
law Professor Lewis H. LaRue,
‘The Right of an Institutionaliz-
ed Mental Patient to Refuse An-
tipsychotic Medication,”’ which
will appear in the December
issue of the University of Toledo
Law Review.

In October, Gaughan will pre-
sent a paper to the American
Association of Sex Educators,
Counselors and Therapists in
Asheville, N. C. The paper is en-
titled “Legal Issues in Sex
Counseling and Therapy.”

Two scientists at Washington
and Lee University have been
awarded grants to support their
research.

Frederic L. Schwab, pro-
fessor of geology, has received
a North Altantic Treaty
Alliance (NATO) grant for
research he will conduct this
fall in Europe while on sab-
batical from his teaching. He
will study the characteristics
and distribution patterns of
sedimentary rocks in the
French, Swiss and Italian Alps
and in the Appenine belt in nor-
thwestern Italy.

Leonard E. Jarrard, pro-
fessor of psychology and head
of that department, has receiv-
ed a $24,200 grant renewal from
the National Science Founda-
tion (NSF) to support continua-
tion of his pioneering research
into the functions of the hip-
pocampus, a small segment of
the brain which is associated
with motivation, memory, and
patterns of basic behavior such
as eating, drinking and sleep-
ing. Since 1965, the federally
supported NSF has provided a
total of more than $200,000 in
support of his hippocampal
studies.

THE

RING-TUM PHI

Stearns Preps
Young Team

by Jerry Harris

In the world of intercollegiate
sports, such names as Colum-
bia, Penn State, Syracuse and
Villinova bring visions of na-
tional rankings, championships
and All-American athletes. So
what is Washington and Lee
University, a lowly Division ITI
school, doing in a league with
those schools?

The Generals are ranked in
their class because W&L will
compete on a varsity level in
water polo for the first time
ever after five years of par-
ticipation in club competition.
W&L is part of the Middle
Atlantic Conference which in-
cludes all four of the aforemen-
tioned schools and some others
as well.

As a club sport, Coach Bill
Stearns and his charges have
done quite well. The highlight of
the past five years was a second
place finish behind the Univer-
sity of Richmond last season in
the Virginia State Tournament.
However, Stearns readily ad-
mits that, “I really don’t know
what the devil we’ll do in this
new conference.” The key to the
upcoming season is experience,
endurance and injuries.

Water polo is a sport that
demands top-notch conditioning
and adequate swimming exper-
tise. While the Generals do have
some super swimmers and have
been emphasizing conditioning
in practice, they are severely
hindered by a lack of numbers.

This problem is one of Coach
Stearns’ main concerns.

He points out that the vast
majority of those already out
for the team (11 total) are just
beginning to learn the game so
that newcomers would not be at
any disadvantage. The polo
head mentor noted that he
would welcome new recruits
and is attempting to gain some
new players from the water
polo P.E. class.

Although depth and en-
durance will be a major hurdle
for W&L, it can be overcome.
Not so for the problem of ex-
perience. Stearns will sport a
club in the first tournament that
shows only one junior and no
seniors. Such youth will prove
helpful in the future growth of
the water polo program but for
this season it could be a major
stumbling block to the Generals
goal of having a _ winning
season.

No matter that the two
troubles mentioned are serious
ones; the most bothersome pro-
blem for W&L is injuries. Three
of the top performers have in-
curred injuries that could
severely cripple the swimming
club. The most damaging blow
was the loss of Billy Myers for
the season. He was the goalie
last season and filling that slot
will be tough. Another loss is
that of Biff Martin who must
overcome an illness before he
can perform up to par.

(continued on page 7)

Soccer Outlook Good

Great strides have been made
by second-year coach Rolf Pira-
nian in an effort to improve the
soccer team’s 1976 3-10 showing.
The ‘‘A” license coach, the
United States Soccer Federa-
tion’s merit of highest coaching
ability, held by only seventy-
nine other coaches in the
country, feels that the fifteen
veterans of last season combin-
ed with the input of talented
freshmen will deliver at least a
.500 season and a run at the
ODAC title.

Piranian is basing the
likelihood of success on a hustl-
ing, intimidating, and
sophisticated defense. ‘‘In the
past,’’ he says, “‘we played a
4-3-3 system. This year we'll
make innovations as_ they’re
called for against different
teams. Ultimately I hope to go
to a man-to-man defense.”’

The beauty of the man-to-man
defense is that is pressures the
opposition so much ‘‘that they

can’t do anything offensively.”
Last year W&L’s opponents did
anything they wanted to, scor-
ing thirty-seven goals, while on-
ly giving up fifteen. With eight
out of fourteen of W&L’s rivals
in Division I, the likes of

Virginia and Navy, the
defense’s task will be an ar-
duous one.

American soccer is

characterized as being ag-
gressive and defense-oriented.
According to Piranian this is
hecause of the lack of ‘‘finesse”’
ballplayers in the United States.
Coach Piranian hopes to imitate
this lusterless, but winning
style. Against the stronger
teams on this season’s schedule
he figures that W&L’s victories
will be 1-0 or 2-1 decisions.
Piranian believes that the
skills of the players have in-
creased under his tutelage. He
has worked on fundamental
techniques, whereas his
predecessor chose not to em-

Generals Run Out Of

Time In Season Opener

by Pete Abitante

Had the NCAA decided to
change the length of its football
games to 39 minutes and 53
seconds at its last annual spring
meeting, W&L would have won
its first season opener in four
years—10-9. As it stands
though, the NCAA made no such
amendment to its constitution
and, thus, the Generals gave
Loch Haven State its first open-
ing day victory in seven
years—22-10. Fine personal per-
formances turned in by Scott
McLan, Kevin McGowan, and
Donny Crossley were over-
shadowed by costly penalties,
mental miscues and missed
receivers all coming at inop-
portune times.

Loch Haven, playing in the
same tough Pennsylvania Con-
ference that brought
Millersville State to Lexington
last year, opened the scoring on
their first possession, controll-
ing the ball for 13 plays. The
drive culminated in a 25-yard
field goal by Kent Harshman.
The Generals came right back,
displaying a good ball control
game of their own. Ted Hissey
hit Richie Wiles with a 12-yard
pass and Danny Thompson pro-
vided the conversion to cap a 10
play, 70-yard drive. With that,
W&L seemed to capture the

momentum and the lead 7-3.

But momentum is a funny
thing. With the Bald Eagles
driving, Donny Crossley in-
tercepted a pass on the W&L 47
and made a spectacular run-
back for a touchdown only to
have it nullified by a clipping
penalty. After an exchange of
punts, Loch Haven once again
mounted a drive. This one was
almost exclusively on the runn-
ing of Steve Housler who car-
ried the ball on 7 of 11 plays
totaling 55 of the 79 yards.
Quarterback Dan Spittal scored
on a five yard keep but the extra
point was no good. Kevin
McGowan angled in unmolested
from his left end position to
block the PAT. Housler by the
way, went on to lead all rushers
with 132 yards on 22 carries.

With the score 9-7 at the half,
the Generals came out and
drove for a score in their first
possession after the intermis-
sion. Donny Crossley’s 26-yard
punt return, made possible by
several perfect blocks, gave the
Generals the ball at midfield.
Eight plays later W&L settled
for a field goal, a 37-yarder by
Thompson, with 7:34 remaining
in the third quarter.

W&L continued to move the
ball with sophomore running
back Scott McLam providing

Cross Country Aims
For Improvements

by Warren Mowry

Continuing a winning tradi-
tion is never easy, but for Coach
Dick Miller’s cross-country
teams winning has become
almost a habit. After coming off
a 9-5 record last fall, with above
average performances in post-
season meets, this year’s squad
aims to equal or improve their
predecessor’s record.

Losing to graduation only last
year’s co-captains, Mike Burns
and Paul Thompson (who was
unable to participate last
season because of injuries),
Coach Miller welcomed thirty
candidates to pre-season
workouts, among them twelve
freshmen and five returning let-
termen. ‘‘That may seem a

small percentage of let-
termen,” commented Coach
Miller, ‘‘but considering only
7-10 men run in each match, we
really have a pretty strong
nucleus.”

Leading the returnees are
senior co-captains Al Weeks
and Bill Welch. These two will
form the core along with senior
Kevin Grimm, junior Jim
Frantz, and sophomore Richard
Bird. Though refusing to ‘“‘put
myself out on a limb” by mak-
ing any predictions, Coach
Miller nonetheless seemed con-
fident of his team’s abilities.

One new development is a
conversion to an 8,000 meter
course as opposed to the old five
mile format. This change

(continued on page 11)

the punch. Playing especially
hard to offset the loss of Stu
Atkinson (ankle _ injury),
McLam showed some great
daylight running, carrying the
ball 15 times for 65 yards and
hauling in 6 passes for 48 yards.
All told, McLam contributed 113
of W&L’s 218 total yards.
However, penalties and mental
errors slowed the Generals
momentum and eventually put
Loch Haven out in front.

After Dan Thompson’s at-
tempted field goal went wide
right, Loch Haven took over and
drove 80 yards in 6 plays for
what proved to be the winning
score. The big play of the drive
came when fullback Charles
Lucas brought the ball inside
the W&L 5, lumbering 35 yards
on a counterplay. Two plays
later Housler crashed in from
two yards out. A two-point con-
version pass was deflected by
Jeff Slatcoff and Loch Haven
held a 15-10 lead.

A General comeback drive
was thwarted when Loch Haven
cornerback Doug Posey in-
tercepted his second pass of the
game and returned it to the
W&L 21. Four plays later runn-
ingback Joe Brooks swept
around left end for the final
score making it Loch Haven 22,
W&L 10.

For two and a half quarters,
W&L deserved to win their
opening contest. The offense,
while looking a little rusty from
lack of scrimmage games, suc-
cessfully moved the ball, with
the offensive line opening up
some beautiful holes. The
defense also showed’ some
streaks of brilliance, but the
Loch Haven counter- play ac-
tion attack seemed to leave
defenders out of position, as at-
tested to by their total offense of
368 yards.

With Davidson the opponent
this week, several changes will
have to be made. The offense
has proven it can move the ball.
A healthy Stu Atkinson:-will give
the Generals that much more
potential. If the defense can at-
tain some consistency and im-
prove its pass rush, Davidson
could be in for a tough after-
noon. There is no doubt W&L
has the personnel to beat
anyone on its schedule, but
unless they play all out for four
quarters, not even the NCAA
can help them. oe

‘Year Of The Generals’

by Pete Abitante

With the return of forty-six
veterans, including 32 let-
termen, optimism is running
high that ‘77 could be the “Year
of the Generals”. Coming off
their most fruitful season in
nine years (5-5), Coach Bill
McHenry and his staff find
themselves loaded with both
youth and experience. Of the
returning lettermen, only eight
are seniors, thirteen are
juniors, and eleven are
sophomores. Thus _ having
underclassmen starting the
past few years seems to have
paid off.

Leading the Generals through
the first eleven game schedule
in their history are senior co-
captains Jeff Slatcoff and Mark
Duncan. Slatcoff, returning to
an inside linebacker position
after a year at middle guard,
will anchor what should prove
to be an invincible linebacking
trio, combining with junior in-
side linebacker Carl Folcik and
junior middle guard George
Ballantyne. Duncan forms the
nucleus of the offensive line,
considered the most improved
facet of the team by Coach
McHenry, as four of five
starters return. Joining Duncan
are sophomore guard Scott
Smith and junior tackles
George Berry and Dan Kniffen.
The other guard spot seems to
be a battle between two juniors
at this time. Jim Guynn once a
center, and specialty team ace
Dave ‘‘Monk’ Hamra, have both
looked good in _ pre-season
workouts with a slight edge go-
ing to Guynn.

The offensive backfield, once
suspect, has come into its own.
Senior quarterbac’: Ted Hissey,
ODAC’s leading’ passer last
year with over 1400 yards, leads
the Generals veer attack. He
will be handing off to a pair of
talented sophomore running
backs in Stewart Atkinson and

Scott McLam. But another dif-
ference in this year’s backfield
is that the Generals have depth.
Hissey is backed up by junior
Scott Swope, sophomore Keith
MacMillan, and freshman Chris
Leisure. Similarly, senior Ed
Johnson and sophomore, Marty
Piccoli are experienced backs
who could step in and play on a
moments notice. Freshman
Karl Cheatham could also see
some playing time.

Several talented receivers
return, led by junior flanker
and ‘76 team leader in recep-
tions, Richie Wiles. Tight end
Bob Szczecinski, fully
recovered from the nagging in-
juries of last year, is back,
while senior Bill Frear, given
the tough assignment of filling
the shoes of departed Tony
Perry, rounds out the receiving
corp. In addition, sophomores
Scott Caddell, Sid Farrar and
freshman Larry Davis provide
the necessary depth.

On defense, cornerback Jack
Norberg and safety Don
Crossley, both all-conference
performers last year, return to
form the heart of the defensive
backfield. The rangey secon-
‘dary, which intercepted a
record 21 passes last year, has
been depleted, though, by the
transfer of two starters.
Regardless, Coach McHenry
places great confidence in hard
hitting, but untested second-
year players Bob Clements and
Kevin McGowan, whom he calls
‘‘more than adequate
replacements.’’ Linebacker-
turned-roverback Larry
Kanavas brings aggressive hit-
ting and experience to the
defensive backfield, and senior
Phil Bailey, junior Larry
McNulty, sophomore Mark
Lewis, and freshman Jim
Herbert are ready to go if called
upon.

If there is a problem on this
year’s team it could be the
defensive line where only one

Water Polo

(continued from page 6)

blems are perfectly illustrated
in the case of Keith Romich.
Romich is the only bona fide
“star” of the team at present.
His experience and conditioning
are unmatched but a strange in-
jury to his shoulder makes him
a questionable starter at pre-
sent. Romich is a returning All-
State water polo member and
an All-American swimmer. He
could be the key. to W&L’s
season as Stearns pointed out
when he said, ‘If he can play
well, he’ll really help us.”’

Even though injuries, depth
and inexperience are. worrying
Stearns, the club will still be
blessed with some. talented
young athletes. Foremost on the
list are three players who saw a
lot of action last season —Scott
Duff (All-American swimmer),
Bob Newcomb and Drew
Pillsbury. Pillsbury might be a
real important asset if he fills
the position of goalie. Other
members of the squad at pre-
sent are Mike Foley, Will
Hodges, Tim Manson, Peter
Stanford, Paul Koehler and

David West. All are young and
have a lot of potential according
to Stearns.

W&L will utilize a pressure-
type game that Stearns hopes
will keep the opponents off-
guard. The head mentor pointed
out that only superior condition-
ing by the Generals would allow
them to reach their goal of a
winning season.

But even if W&L does not
have a winning record this
year, they can still accomplish
the ulterior goal of the team.
‘We hope to build the program
up,” and to help this cause
along, the head coach has struc-
tured on exciting strategy,
organized a young team and is
scheduling two key tour-
naments to be held in Doremus
this season. The first, an open
Invitational, will be held on Oc-
tober 7, 8. Then the State Tour-
nament will be hosted on Oc-
tober 28, 29. Stearns hopes that
the two events will draw large
crowds and just as much sup-
port for W&L’s newest varsity
sport.

   

starter returns—junior tackle
George Fisher. The other tackle
spot will be filled by sophomore
Jamie Ryan, while the defen-
sive end positions will be a toss-
up. Battling for the split end
spot are part-time starters from
last year Greg Lilly and Tom
Baynham, while junior Ken
Smith and sophomore Mark
Louden compete for the other
end position. Junior Mark
Travers and freshman Bob Gor-
don will provide the depth.
Although backed up by ex-
cellent linebacking, the line will
have to develop some consisten-
cy if the defensive unit is to jell.

The kicking game should be
in fine shape as placekicker
Dan Thompson returns for his
third season to handle the
placements.

Phil Bailey and sophomore
Sid Farrar, one and two respec-
tively in the ODAC last year,
return to handle the punting
chores.

Overall, the Generals have
what could be the finest team
since they joined the college
division three rankings in 1955.
The players are excited, com-
mitted and have worked hard
during the preseason. ‘“‘We are
looking forward to an exciting
and challenging season,” says
coach McHenry. “Our attitude
is high, and with a little work on
our execution, we can be a fine
football team.” Coach McHenry
also added that the first two
games against Lock Haven
State and Davidson College
could set the tone for the year
especially with an eleven game
schedule.

Yes, with the proper execu-
tion, a little jelling on offense
and defense, the proper adjust-
ment by new and experienced
players, and a little luck to stay
free of injuries, this could in-
deed be the “Year of the
Generals.”

For Brains,

by Jim Barnes

As the practices for the fall
sports teams begin, coaches are
appraising, exalting, and be-
moaning the corps of freshmen
athletes, reaped from their ar-
duous efforts of recruiting the
previous year. However, at
Washington and Lee recruiting
does not have the traditional
connotation it commands at the
Big 10 or the Ivies. Coaches,
bound by the restrictions of
Washington Hall, are unable to
provide grants-in-aid and
scholarships, or even to insure
the entry of a talented but
adademically deficient athlete.

“They do a good job,”’ says
Director of Admissions James
Farrar, ‘“‘Sometimes I think
they’re harder judges of a stu-
dent’s academic credentials
than we are.”’ Both the admis-
sions and the athletic depart-
ments are quick to point out the
good relations that have existed
over the years between them.

Farrar feels that coaches who
go on “recruiting’’ trips are a
valuable arm of the admissions
department. ‘‘When they go toa
high school they don’t simply
discuss the benefits of playing
sports at W&L, they emphasize
the school’s academic offerings

Brawn

and standards.’ Compliantly,
coaches only encourage
athletes to apply to W&L if they
have certain academic
qualifications. Farrar says,
“We tell them at the beginning
of each year to look for students
with mid-500 boards and in the
top quarter of their class.”

This year athletic department
figures indicate that their
recruiting activities con-
tributed to 500 out of the 1320 ap-
plications received by the ad-
missions department. Farrar is
skeptical of this figure claiming
that “‘initial contact’’ might
have been made with the offices
in Washington Hall, rather than
on recruiting trips. Farrar ex-
plains that when a student ap-
plies to W&L and states an in-
terest in playing sports, or has a
background of playing varsity
sports at his high school, the ad-
missions department alerts the
respective coach and lets him
chose to pursue the prospect or
not. Farrar claims the number
of applications attributable to
the athletic department is
below 400.

One big impediment to
W&L’s coaches’ recruiting ef-
forts is the nonexistence of
athletic scholarships. When the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Well, here we start another school year, and as has
been true with other school year beginnings, school is
not the most important thing about the start in most
people’s minds. Rush is; and the mad rush to have a
good rush is on.

As usual, everyone is involved. The upperclass
fraternity men are striving to fill their quotas: The
houses have been overhauled, the taps have been
cleaned out, personalities have been sufficiently sac-
charined, and the golden bids have been polished.

The GDI’ s, when asked for advice about fraternity
life, givea slightly slanted view about fraternities and
the way of life they themselves have chosen. Pointing
out the evils of initiation, Hell Week, and the hazing
that is not supposed to exist, the independents give a
little support to their own recruitment program.

And the freshmen, who are already bewildered by
beginning a new life in college, leaving home, parents
and friends for the first time, and trying to decide
what courses to take and which highway to set their
lives on, are stretching to put their best foot forward
into the doors which (they have been led to believe)
lead to the only social life on this campus.

The questions we continually ask are “Is this the
right way to handle rush? Are the freshmen, for
whom rush is supposed to benefit and protect,
prepared to make the all-important decision of going
frat or going independent with so many other and
maybe more important decisions to be made first?
Freshmen should not join a brotherhood of in-
dividuals based upon the first impressions a frat
house has made upon them. It would be better if they
were given more time to get to know what lies behind
the often plastic rush mask.

Visit a fraternity during rush and you won’t have to
listen hard to hear complaints like, ‘‘God, rush is a
bore’’ or ‘‘I’ll be glad when this is over.’’ The frat
brothers don’t actually take rush seriously, as
evidenced by the number of reported violations and
warnings given to each house. As soon as rush is over,
they can strip away their facade and resume being
themselves.

This is the present atmosphere that surrounds rush
and it is defeating the whole purpose of rush. That
purpose is to give the freshmen a clear picture of
every fraternity and to help them decide whether or
not they want to join a frat, and which frat will be
right for them.

If rush were held during the winter term, the
freshmen would already be settled into the study part
of college life. They would have had a half year to
get to know the different frats and explore below the
surface level of the brothers’ personalities. They
would also be exposed to the different avenues of
social and extracurricular pursuits available to the
W&L student. All these would contribute to their deci-
sion of joining a frat or remaining independent. And it
would relieve much of the pressure that now exists
during beginning-of-the-year rush to “‘hurry and join
a frat before it’s too late.”

But, alas, since tradition is so strong and important
here at W&L, and because this present form of rush is
the way it has always been done, many ripe and inno-
cent freshmen will be lured by the melodies of the
fraternal pied pipers and ‘‘shag”’ and “‘pretzel”’ their
way into what many consider a regretable decision.

FACTS ABOUT WINES

 

Winetasting
Want to learn to taste wines
so you can select your own
favorites? Wine is a personal
experience and the best way
to choose the ones you like is
all in the tasting.

Winetasting obviously in-
volves your sense of taste plus
two others, sight and smell.
You start by looking at the-
wine. Pour some into a clear
wine glass. Hold it by the
stem, examine the _ wine
against the light. Your wine
should be clear, brilliant,
without any suspended ma-
terials.

Next comes smell. You test
the wine with your nose to
determine its aroma or fra-
grance of the grape from
which it was made and its
bouquet, the scent resulting
from the fermentation pro-
cess. Swirl the glass a few
times to release aroma and
bouquet. Then, don’t be
bashful. Put your nose right
in the glass and sniff. If the
wine smells bitter or vinegary,
it isn’t good. It should be a
pleasurable experience. You'll
quickly discover why we
winemasters consider this a
vital part of the tasting pro-
cess and that each wine has
what we call its own “nose.”

Finally, taste your wine,
sipping just a small amount.
Roll it around in your mouth
to coat your taste buds. At
this stage, you’re judging the
wine’s character—its body
and richness. Next, swallow
the wine. As you do, judge its
aftertaste or what is called
the wine’s ‘“‘finish.’’ And, if
you’re tasting more than one
wine «at a time, rinse your
mouth out with water be-
tween sips. It cleans your
taste buds. :

Winetasting is an enjoyable
part of my job and it’s the
process I use to seleet wines
produced by my _),family’s
winery, B. Cribari & Sons.
And, by the way, we have the
largest public tasting room in
California where you, too,
can ‘personally sample our
fine wines to your heart’s
content. Do come and visit us
at Fresno—it’ll be an ex-
perience you'll always trea-

McDaniel Leads
Archaeological Survey

A team of Washington and

ducted an archaeological
survey on behalf of the National
Park Service in the northern
section of the Shenandoah Na-

The purpose of the survey
was to determine if any
prehistoric or historic sites of
significance are located in an
area designated for develop-
ment near the Dicky Ridge
Visitors Center.

Dr. John McDaniel, director
of the Liberty Hall team, said
the students searched the area
and sunk test pits looking for

Dr. Halford Ryan, assistant
professor of public speaking at

of American politics make them
interesting to listen to, and pro-

An ardent yachtsman
named Paul A. Sperry
slipped on a wet boat deck
on a blustery day in the mid-
1930s—and that mishap led
to his inventing an anti-skid
rubber sole that is still the
basic functional sole of to-
day’s Sperry Top-Sider boat
shoe.

He was searching for a
solution to the slippery sole
problem when he observed
his pet cocker spaniel run-

yard. Carefully examining
the dog’s paws, he noticed
little cracks going in all
directions on the pads of
the animal’s feet. He
worked out a similar zig-zag
pattern for a boating shoe
sole—and the Sperry Top-
Sider came into being.

Today, 42 years later,
these traditionally styled,
quality-crafted shoes, made
by Uniroyal, range from
smart penny loafers and
moccasins to classic
sneakers, in canvas, suede,

wet or polished surface—
great for boaters and non-

Recruiters Make The Grade

(continued from page 7)

university offers money to an
athlete with financial need, it’s
usually broken down into three
categories, a grant, a loan, and
work study. In most cases the
loan and work study makes up
60-70% of the money received
by the student. It’s unlikely that
this total sum contributes to
more than 50% of the student’s
college costs. As one coach put
it, ‘‘How do you get an athlete to
come here when he’s offered a
complete free ride at some

other school?”’
Unlike some of the nation’s

most prestigious institutions,
W&L’s coaches cannot engage
in the practice of ‘‘wild-
carding”. This allows coaches
to admit an athlete by fiat under
some previously determined
quota that the coach has been
allotted for that year. Some
coaches here.don’t fee! com-
fortable with that practice.
Lacrosse coach Jack Emmer
says, “You’d have to be careful
wild-carding. You have a situa-

tion where one coach is making
a decision on the prospective
success or failure of a student
academically. At a place like
this I think that’s unfair to the
individual you’re_ wild-
carding.”

However coaches point out
that they’re not formally involv-
ed with the admissions pro-
cedure. Basketball coach Verne
Canfield says, “I think it’s in-
teresting to note that in my 14
years here, there’s never been a
member of the athletic depart-
ment on the admissions’ com-
mittee.’ The fact is there has
never been an athletic faculty
member on the admissions
committee. Athletic Director
Bill McHenry states, ‘I think
any faculty member in my
department is qualified to sit on
the admissions committee.”
Coach Emmer thinks having a
coach involved in the admis-
sions process ‘‘would be a good
idea, if possible from the
coach’s time standpoint.”

lamp. These will be replenished
as demand requires. Sand-
wiches, however, will still be
made to order.

Mr. Darrell has already
heard complaints, however, he
feels most are unfounded. Some
people are concerned over the
pre-cooking of hamburgers. Mr.
Darrell responds to this com-
plaint saying that last year,
hamburgers were cooked in the
morning and then steamed
when they were needed. This
year a customer will receive a
hamburger that has been off the
grill only a few minutes.

There will definitely be pro-
blems with the new arrange-
ment. The reorganization was
started on Tuesday, August
30th, and completed in only
forty-eight hours. As with any
new system problems must be
ironed out. Famie Smothers,
who manages the operation on a
day-to-day basis, has worked
for the university for twenty-
five years and is receptive to

the wishes of students. Mr. Dar-
rell promises that changes will
be made as necessary.

Editor’s Note: Supply store

4 P.M. Monday thru Friday.

necessitated some minor
alterations in the course,
thereby shortening it by slightly
over fifty yards.

The harriers open their
season at home in a squad meet
against Davis and _ Elkins,
Sheperd, and West Virginia
Tech and have only two more
home meets before climaxing
the season with the ODAC
Championships and the Divi-
sion III National Champion-
ships, being held in Cleveland
Nov. 12.

“In the past,” Farrar said,
‘Faculty members on the ad-
missions committee have been
those who teach degree offered
subjects. Four years ago the
question of placing a member of
the athletic department on the
admissions committee was
raised. The idea was rejected
by the committee which
nominates its own successors.

Dean Farrar doesn’t believe
that a coach on the admissions’s
committee would be prejudiced
in admitting an athlete over a
non-athlete if his academic
record didn’t merit the deci-
sion. It is reasonable therefore
to assume that a person, who
comes in contact with young
men daily, who shares in their
emotions of success and failure,
and who constantly is striving
with them for perfection is as
competent a judge as the person
whose contact with young men
is disunited by the desk and
lectern.

Soccer Chart: ““Defense”’

(continued from page 6)

the off-season last year’s team
members played indoor soccer,
which promotes quickness and
contact. They also participated
in summer leagues.

Enjoying the benefits of a
good recruiting year, Piranian
expects that there will be
freshmen starting on both the
offense and defense. He insists
there are no secure positions on
the team at this moment. Pira-
nian forsees ‘‘every position on
the team being fiercely con-
tested.’”’

Another one of Piranian’s
goals is to upgrade the soccer
program in general at W&L. He

cites improved morale and
comraderie over preceeding
teams, including the highly suc-
cessful ’73 team which he, co-
captained, as a reason for op-
timism about this and future
seasons.

The first action for the
Generals will be in a two-day
tournament at Virginia
Wesleyan on the 17th, and 18th,
of this month. None of the teams
in the tournament are of the
caliber of some of W&L’s up-
coming Division I opponents. A

poor showing in this early ac-

tion could be the prelude to
another disappointing season.

very friendly and not so
friendly—strengthened. I think
it will be an exciting thing.”’

Jackson’s involvement with
“The Force’’ began last sum-
mer through his minister, who
happens to be the national
leader of the organization.
Jackson worked as an ad-
ministrative assistant for the
Force’s first mission to
England.

Jackson’s friends report that
he found the travel and interna-
tional experience very much to
his liking. In August Jackson’s
minister asked him to join “‘The
Force” as a_ full-time paid

employee in the upcoming year,
and guaranteed him a job upon
graduation from W&L.

Although his decision was
difficult, because of his respon-
sibilities to the SAB, Jackson
decided, after prompting from
deans and friends, to take the
job.

That leaves Charlie Hulfish
as the sole head of the SAB.
Hulfish said, however, ‘‘As far
as I understand it the E. C. is
reopening the consideration of
applications and I imagine that
will be coming up soon.”’ The E.
C. will probably consider the
issue at their first meeting on
Monday.

Another task Washington and
