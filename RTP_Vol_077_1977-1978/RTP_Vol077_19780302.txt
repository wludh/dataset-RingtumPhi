EC discusses
Phi article

by Randy Smith

The publication last week of a
student’s name in connection
with his conviction of an honor
violation touched off an intense-
ly heated debate during Mon-
day night’s Executive Commit-
tee meeting.

Jim Underhill, president of
the EC, said he was ‘very
disappointed”’ to read the Ring-
tum Phi’s front page article
which named the individual in
its lead paragraph. He also ex-
pressed disappointment in the
EC member who had given the
newspaper information about
the case.

Underhill took issue with the
assumption that the EC should
enforce its own decisions. He
explained that there is no writ-
ten policy which requires EC to
enforce honor convictions. “‘It is
not our position to walk the per-
son to the bus station,”’ he said.

“‘We expected him to leave,”
Underhill continued. The presi-
dent related that a meeting of
the EC had been scheduled for
last Thursday afternoon to
discuss the individual’s continu-
ing presence on campus, but
had been called off because the
person reportedly had left.

Vice president George Griffin
explained the rational of not
publicly discussing honor cases
as a method of protecting the in-
dividual involved. ‘‘We follow
the assumption not to discuss
the merits of a case’’ should the
accused wish an open trial,
Griffin said. (A public trial is
the appeal mechanism after an
hour convictio conviction.)

When questioned, Underhill
would neither confirm nor deny
that the individual involved had
requested an open tiral.
However, at the end of the
meeting, Underhill said the ar-
ticle should not have been
printed ‘“‘when the case was

about to go open.” No notice of
an open trial was ever posted.

J. Michael Gallagher, editor
of the Ring-tum Phi, argued
that ‘‘the person in question was
being allowed to participate in
University functions. The EC

should enforce its own
policies.”’
“We are not going to police
this campus,’’ Underhill
reiterated.

“Don’t attack this committee
for something it’s not responsi-
ble for,” interjected Jim Davis,
Junior EC representative.

Griffin explained that the EC
has “certain roles to fulfill,”
and escorting persons convicted
of honor violations off campus
is not one of those roles.

Speaking for the newspaper,
Gallagher said theRing-tum Phi
has always cooperated with the
EC.” However, ‘‘since this case
involved a public official who
handled $30,000 of student
funds, and misused the powers
of his office, we decided to
publish the story.”

Law representative Tom Hea-
ly called the publication of the
article a ‘‘gross breach of trust.
This is as big a violation of
students’ rights as I’ve ever
seen in here.”

“It is still not clear if (the EC
has) the jurisdiction to remove
anyone from the campus,”
Underhill concluded. He said he
would seek a ‘“‘policy statement
from the appropriate
officials” — notibly the Publica-
tions Board.

In other action by the Ex-
ecutive Committee:

—TheBig Three Election (for
president, vice president and
secretary of the EC) will be
held March 13. Petitions of
students applying for those

positions must be submitted to
the EC by March 6. 150 names in

Fancy Dress ’78 is a memory

by Galen Trussell

Fancy Dress 1978 is now a.
memory. Images remain of
rented tuxes, wilted coursages,
happy and unhappy dates Rack
or otherwise, cars stuck in the
mud at a grain party, a typical-
ly slanderous Washington Post
article and the Four Tops.

An aspect of Fancy Dress that
few W&L students knew of, or
will remember, were the hours
of planning and labor the SAB
put into the event. The SAB’s
labor was directed primarily by
two individuals, Art Dunnam, a
sophomore, and Jim Foreman,
a senior. Dunnam and Foreman
were the planners, coordinators
and troubleshooters for this

year’s Fancy Dress. Their _

memories of the event are un-
doubtedly different than the
average student.

According to Foreman, this
year’s Fancy Dress was the
best he has been involved with.
Foreman thought preparations
for the ball went much
smoother than in previous

Pub board supports Phi position

by Paul Daugherty

. The University Publications
Board refused to consider a sug-
gestion made by - three
members of the Executive
Committee that the board in-
clude in its constitution a
paragraph stating that all
university publications would
adhere strictly to rules in the
White Book.

The White Book is the hand-
book given to all students and
explains the Honor System at
Washington and Lee.

The decision followed a pro-
posal made by Executive Com-
mittee President Jim Underhill
and Vice-President George

Griffin that a clause be added to-

the Publications Board con-
stitution which would state that

White Book rules be upheld in
all university publications.

The proposal was prompted
by an article in the Feb. 24 issue
of the Ring-tum Ring-tum Phi in
which the name of a
Washington and Lee student
convicted of an honor violation
was published.

The White Book directs that
names of honor trial defendants
be held in strict confidence.

The Publications Board,
which supervises all official
school publications, has no
policy concerning the
publishing of the names of those
who violate the Honor Code, ac-
cording to chairman Ryland
Owen. But both he and other
members of the board said that
the addition of a clause as pro-

posed by Underhill and Griffin
would be meaningless.

Underhill argued that the
Ring-tum Phiarticle “abused
the concept of confidentiality.”’

‘We (the E.C.) don’t think it’s
appropriate that anything about
the Honor Code be published,”
he said.

Both he and Griffin wanted
the addition to the Publication
Board constitution to ‘prevent
another incident of this nature
from happening,’ he said.

Ring-tum Phi Editor J.
Michael Gallagher defended the
paper’s actions by saying that
the intent of the article was to
uphold the Honor System by
detailing to the student body the
ways in which the defendant,

years. He said he could only
remember several minor pro-
blems with the ball in general.

One last minute problem Art
Dunnam remembered was the
need to find a piano for the Duke
Ellington band. He said there
was also a problem with the
coat room in that it was not
large enough to accommodate
all the coats, and was filled by
11. Dunnam also recalled a pro-
blem with a leak in the Univer-
sity Center roof and with
lighting.

Accoring to Foreman, the
Friday night crowd was
relatively well behaved. Less
beer was consummed than had
been expected, only 66 of 90
kegs were drained. Only oen im-
portant item (a chair rumored
to be at the SAE house) was
reported missing.

Both Dunnam and Foreman
said they knew of no incidents
where students were destruc-
tive enough to warrant being
reported to the EC. Both admit-

Security foul-up

 

ted that they had planned for
the smaller decorations to
become souvenirs. Dunnam
said no important decorations
were damanged due to good
work done by bouncers. He did
criticize the bouncers for their
failure to keep people out of
restricted areas.

The major decorations such
as wall hangings and paintings
will be stored by the University.
Foreman acknowledged those
decorations have limited future
use because of their orientation
to a particular theme. However,
he added the SAB plans to rent
some of this year’s decorations
to Lexington High for its prom.

The SAB also had a bar built
to help make serving the beer
easier. The bar will also be
stored by the University and
will be used for Fancy Dress in
coming years. The cost of the
bar was about $580, a price
which Foreman said was about
$1,000 cheaper than a bid by

Fight occurs at concert

by Kenneth Mastrilli

Crowded conditions and lax
security may have cause a fight
at the Four Tops concert Thurs-
day night according to students
involved in the fracus, in which
one student required stitches
after being hit over the head
with an empty bottle.

Jesse Shaver, a sophomore
member of Phi Kappa Sigma
said he had been squating down
to pick something up when
Terry Pollock, an SAE junior,
hit him over the head with an
empty bottle, causing injuries
severe enough to require stit-
ches on his nose and forehead.

Pollock said that during the
concert, Sahver, who Pollock
Says was standing next to him,
kept bumping into Pollock and
spilling beer on him and his

date. Pollock said he asked
Shaver to stop bumping him
and his date, but Shaver just
shook his head no.

“T felt he was bullying me,”’
said Pollock,” and I simply lost
control and hit him with the bot-
tle.” Pollock said he too re-
quired stitches on his thumb
which had been cut by the
broken glass. After leaving the
infirmary Pollock said he went
to the Phi Kappa Sigma house
to have a few beers and when he
says Shaver, who also just
came out of the infirmary, saw
him in the house. Pollock said
after a short argument he left
and hasn’t seen Shaver since.

When asked how he got the
bottle into the gym, Pollock said
no one had checked him coming

Sound of Music to be screened

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor

This weekend, the Student Ac-
tivities Board is bringing to
campus another of its long str-
ing of excellent films this
year,The Sound of Music. The
film will be shown in duPont
Hall Saturday and Sunday
nights at 7:30, with a Sunday
matinee at 2:0-.

“A sensational musical is on
its way to Broadway,” announc-
ed Variety when The Sound of
Music opened for the first time
in 1959, in New Haven. And the
verdict was the same at the
New York opening, the same
year. The musical was the last
of a number of record-breaking
shows by Rodgers andHam-
merstein. This pair had re-
juvenated the American
musical with the opening of
theirOklahoma! in 1943, and the

The Land of Oz

Every year, W&L is treated
to a few excellent, small
theatrical productions —
readings or one-man shows.
Certainly, one of the most am-
bitious in recent years is
scheduled to open this weekend.
This Friday and Saturday,
March 3 & 4, at 8 p.m. in the
Troubadour Theatre, Warren
Mowry will present a one-man
show, Clarence Darrow, based
on a play of the same name by
David F:intels.

The production is a long one
for a one-man show (about 90
minutes), but is a full one, as
befits the subject. Almost

everyone has at least heard of
Clarence Darrow, one of the
keenest legal minds of modern
times. Brilliant, abrasive,
dazzling, he was probably the
closest real-life equivalent of
the fictional barrister.

The play is based on the
lawyer’s recollections, filled
with humor, of his professional
career. Always ready to fight
for the seemingly doomed, his
greatest ‘“‘performance’’ pro-
bably occured in the famous
Scopes ‘‘monkey trial,’ about
the teaching of Darwin’s
theories of evolution in grade
schools. At this point in the

play, Mowry has elected to in-
terject a section from the prize-
winning dramalnherit the
Wind. The part presented will
be the climactic victory scene,
where Darrow trapped the pro-
secutor, William Jennings
Bryan, on the witness stand.
Mowry is presenting the show
as his part of his senior thesis in
acting. No reservations are
necessary for the show, and
there is no ticket charge. All are
welcome, and urged to attend
the showing of a portrait — a
man who is truly one of
America’s ‘‘characters.”’

‘Clarence Darrow”

in Troubadour this weekend

by Seth.Oserin

‘‘Heroes’’ stars Henry
Winkler and Sally Field in a mo-
ition picture that is effective but
siow and hesitant in its com-
munication.

The plot centers around a Viet
Nam vet (Henry Winkler) who
is returned to a Veterans;
hospital (where he has been a
psychiatric patient) after
creating a disturbance at an ar-
my recruiting office. He
manages to escape, after being
given $1000 of his buddies
money for investment into a
worm farm.

The rest of the film deals with
his trek from New York to L.A,
during which he meets Sally
Field on a bus. We are exposed
to various antics and
predicaments caused by
Winkler which eventually in-
volves Miss Field (who is alone
on the bus, trying to find a
reason to marry her fiance the
following Sunday). Henry later
has dreams shatter but realizes
solitude in finding a lasting

relationship with Sally. And she
in him.

It all seems very simple —
and it is. In fact, there is
nothing special about this film.
The director, Jeremy Paul
Kagen, often loses sight of
character relationships and in-
tensity degrees. Scenes which
should be high in intensity often
(but not always) break down
before their peak. The script,
however, is not sharp, and may
be some of the director’s pro-
blem.

Sally Field, who is only now
starting to get some of the
recognition she deserves, has
trouble concentrating
throughout the film. She has ex-
tremely good moments that are
constantly fading in and out of
rather poor attempts at emo-
tion. A good example of this oc-
curs when she calls her fiance
near the end of the film. For
some reason, one gets the im-
pression that Miss Field had her
heart someplace else during the
filming of this picture.

Henry Winkler does a good
job with what he was given.
However, at times it seems as
though he was too cute with his
antics, and too extreme with
emotion (although this could be
the director’s fault.)

It would be easy to write this
film off as a failure, like so
many other critics have done,
but this film had one redeeming
quality.

To an age group that just
missed fighting in the war, the
picture will have a strong im-
pact. It brought out the anguish
caused by the Viet Nam war in
present day terms. Ideas about
past experiences’ relation to

present actions become more —

fully understood, as the viewer
leaves with an understanding of
a person’s pain, along with a
damnation in the subconscious
of the ‘‘glories”’ of war.

‘“‘Heroes”’ is playing through
Tuesday at theLyric. It’s worth
the two bucks. Only the totally
insensitive will leave the
theater without having seen the
movie.

years that followed were filled
with similar victories:
Carousel, The King and I, and
the Pulitzer Prize-winning
South Pacific.

The Sound of Music is based
on the story of Maria vonTrapp,
a convent girl who later mar-
ried the wealthy baron with
seven children. The story builds
to an exciting climax, as it
traces her days in the convent,
her service to the von Trapps as
governess, the subsequent mar-
riage to the baron, and the hor-
ror of Nazi annexation of
Austria in 1938.

The story was a natural one
for the hands of Richard
Rodgers and Oscar Hammers-
tein. Exotic setting, appealing
characters, but with more than
a little human warmth. The
music is of their trademark,
those famous songs which are
integrated perfectly with the
story line, yet are able to stand
alone as popular tunes.

Rodgers and Hammerstein’s
musical productions are
marvels of stagecraft. Perhaps
that is why most of them were
relative failures in their movie
versions for only this film suc-
ceeded as a major boxoffice at-
traction. Filmed on location in

 

Salzburg, Austria, the one show
accused by some of being a bit
shallow on the stage gained a
whole new dimension from the
sweep of the Tyrolean Alps.
Julie Andrews played Maria in
the film and themagnetism of
her performance is_ largely
responsible for its success, a
worthy successor to the original
Broadway performance of
Mary Martin.

The phenomenal success of

the picture at the boxoffice, sur- -

passing even Gone With the
Wind, ensured the survival of
20th Century-Fox in the
troublesome 1960’s. Having
been brought to its knees by the
staggering costs of Elizabeth
Taylor’s Cleopatra, the studio
launched $50 million in other
blockbuster musicals. But the
others failed miserably. THis
ended, unfortunately, any
rivival of interest in lavish
musicals such as those of the
1940’s and 1950’s And put Fox
back in its original state of debt.

So, on this weekend of
recovery after Fancy Dress,
one dollar will buy a ticket to
the biggest money-making
popular success in the years
between Gone With the Wind
and The Godfather...

Those of you who chose to
finish up your Fancy Dress
weekend discoing out at the frat
house missed a prime op-
portunity to see a really great
performer. George Fischoff,
the jazz pianist who thrilled
crowds in the EC room Friday
night, decided to stay in Lex-
ington another night and bang
on his piano again for W&L
students.

Fischoff is a songwriter who
has written such hits as Ninety-
eight Point Six for Keith
and Lazy Day for Spanky and
Our Gang. Also to his own
recording credit, his last four
records have hit the Billboard
top 100. He wrote the score for a
Broadway musical, Georgie
based on the play Georgie Girl .
Georgie unfortunately closed
after five performances. He is
presently working on another
musical based on the James
Michner novel, Sayonara.

It was fun for all as Fischoff
grabbed students from the au-
dience and had them repeatedly
punch a note on the piano while
he composed a piece around it.
He could easily have been a
standup comic, telling jokes
and them inprovising songs to
go along with his stories.
Besides his improvisational
pieces, he played excerpt from
his old hits, his new record

Pit
Piano Picker, and a hoped for
hit which Perry Como will sing,
Everything.

“T’m the only guy around who
writes only piano pieces. I don’t
write lyrics, as I can’t sing.”
Fischoff proved this, but the
crowd still enjoyed hearing him
try. The jazz pianist said, ‘I
like to have fun with music. It
isn’t true entertainment unless
the audience is included.” Well,
Fischoff included the audience
Saturday night, and he had fun
and so did they.

This weekend: Burr Datz and
Friends will appear in the
Cockpit Thursday night. Datz
appeared in the ‘‘Pit’’ last term.
On Friday and Saturday night,
Marty Bear will return to enter-
tain students. Last year, Bear
played in the Cockpit an entire
week. That fact alone is enough
to tell you he is an extraor-

dinary individual.
On next ‘happy hour’’
Wednesday, Willie  Nininger

will mix his own compositions
with songs by John Prine,
Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan,
Jimmy Buffet, and Jackson
Browne. Nininger incorporates
humor and satire into his act,
which gives it his own personal
style. He has been the backup
for such name performers as
Buffet and Steve Goodman.

Thus ends another install-
ment of ‘In your Pit.’’ Will see
you later, in your pit.

W&L’s own Building and
Grounds Department.

Foreman said he knew of only
one person hurt Friday night in
what he described as a very
humorous incident. According
to Foreman, an alumni fell off a
railing while reaching for a
souvenir. The alumni fell on top
of a Sweet Briar girl knocking
her out and sending her to the
hospital for the night.

Foreman and Dunnam also
agreed that the belly dancer
was the crowd;s favorite side
show. The belly dancer was
Jane Newman of Harrisonburg.
Mrs. Newman teaches classes
in belly dancing in Harrison-

burg. The fellow standing
beside her with the sword was
her husband.

Dunnam said he received a
lot of positive feedback concer-
ning the vocalist with the Duke
Ellington band, and about the
band in general. Foreman said
he thought the band was easier
to dance to than last year’s
band which starred Woody Her-
man. Both Dunnam and
Foreman said the crowd en-
joyed the orchestra’s older
tunes more than its more recent
ones.

Attendance at the ball was
lower than last year, due in part
to the limited number of tickets.
Foreman estimated approx-
imately 1,300 tickets were sold
to W&L students, and about 180
were sold to alumni. These
numbers coupled with the facul-
ty who attended, made the totai
attendance figure around 3,000,
according to Foreman.

Foreman was optimistic
about the expense for the event.

He said he didn’t believe the
SAB was going to loose any
money on the event, and that
the SAB might even end up in
the black. In 1976 the ball broke
even and last year it made
about $1,000.

Costs for the various acts Fri-
day night were as follows:
$4,000 for the Duke Ellington
band, not including sound and,
lights; $1,000 to $900 for the
mentalist; $650 for the belly
dancer. Dunnam _ estimated
these costs coupled with the
projected cost of decorations,
building and grounds clean-up’
beer and assorted items totaled
approximately $10,000.

Alumni who attended the
function came mostly from the
class of 1977, followed by the
class of 1975, according to
Foreman. Five alumni couples
from the class of 1936 were also
at the affair.

Sales of the various
paraphenalia associated with
Fancy Dress also went well,
Foreman said. The hottest sell-
ing items were the Fancy Dress
grain cups. The SAB sold 3,000
of the cups in two-and-a-half
days and made about $200 profit
on them. Fancy Dress posters
sold fairly well according to
Dunnam. The posters were be-
ing sold for below cost.

The souvenir coins, handed to
each couple as they entered,
were Dunnam’s idea. The coins
were minted so that the side
featuring the busts of
Washington and Lee could be
used in subsequent years on
other coins.

Interesting enough, both per-

though in obviously different
ways. The reason lies of course
in the strength of Brahm’s com-

such radically different but
equally valid interpretations
proves once again the value of
classical music. Each man can

Generals win NCAA

B-ball playoff berth |

by Mark Mitchell

The Washington and Lee
basketball team wrapped up
their second straight ODAC
crown last weekend by clobber-
ing Bridgewater 108-80 and
defeating Lynchburg 72-65.

Bridgewater had only lost to
the Generals by 4 points, a week
earlier. The Eagles, inspired by
that moral victory, came out
playing with great intensity.
However, the Generals also
came to play and within ten
minutes they had taken control,
as they romped to their 11th
straight victory over
Bridgewater.

In the finals, Washington and
Lee had anything but an easy
time with the talented Lyn-
chburg Hornets. Lynchburg,
playing on their home court,
busted out to an 11-4 lead.

Despite the slow start, the
turning point of the game may
well have been with Collins
blocked E. D. Schechterly’s
first shot. Schechterly, who had
thoroughly dominated
Hampden-Sydney, was much
more reticient to shoot after
that point. In fact, the AIlLODAC
center only took sic shots all
night.

The Generals took most of the
first helf to make up that 7 point
deficit and managed to take a 1
point lead at half-time.

In the second half, Pat Dennis
finally managed to wear down
his vei'y quick and determined
defender (all-ODAC guard
Wayne Davis). Dennis scored
six straight points and the
Generals soon led 51-41.

In a surprise maneuver, Lyn-
chburg reacted to the ten point
deposit by unveiling a half court
press. The - press was
successful—Selinger, the
Hornets point guard, had two

diving steals and Schechterly
had two blocked shots. In addi-
tion, the Generals were being
called for violations they pro-
bably would not have been call-
ed for at home — several block-
ing fouls and a traveling viola-
tion that nullified a possible 3
point play.

Yet Lynchburg could pull no
closer than two points. They
missed 7 of 17 attempts in the
second half, and many of those
misses were on the front end of
one and one situations. W&L,
on the other hand, converted 16
of 19 free throws in the second
half.

Free throw shooting was
vitally important with 10
seconds to go. With ten seconds
left to play, the Generals were
up by only two, but Dennis was
at the line. Dennis sank both
free throws. Lynchburg ran
down the floor, missed a shot,
and immediately fouled Collins.
Collins, who was 6 per 8 from
the line, made the first shot of
the one and one. He missed the
second one, but Leunig, who
had 17 points, rebounded the
ball and put it back up. Thus,
the Generals’ 7 poin margin of
victory is a deceiving statistic.

The win, the team’s 21st of the
year, allows them to go to the
NCAA tournament for the se-
cond straight year. The team is
very optimistic since they have
won 11 of their last 12 games.
Also, they placed some nor-
theastern teams this year in
order to become accustomed to
playing the very quick teams
that New Jersey is noted for
possessing. Thus, when they
play Jersey City this Friday at
Kean College, they should not
be as unprepared as they were
in last year’s NCAA tourna-
ment.

Rogers ODAC wrestler of the year

Wrestlers send 4 to nationals

by Mark Peterson

Ed Rodgers, the 1978 Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Wrestler of the Year, and six of
his teammates captured in-
dividual championships as the
Wrestling Generals won their
second consecutive ODAC
championship Wednesday even-
ing at Eastern Mennonite. Nine
Generals made it to the finals as
the team maintained its
undefeated career record in the
ODAC, scoring 105.5 points to 78
for second place Lynchburg.
Eastern Mennonite and
Hampton-Sydney brought up
the rear with 27 and 25 points
respectively.

After the team sat out the
finals of the 118 pound division,
Howdy Knipp beban a string of
nine consecutive Generals in
the finals. Knipp, who was a
conference champion three
years ago closed his career on
the same note, registering an
overwhelming 17-4 victory in
the finals after pinning his oppo-
nent in the first round.

Following Mike Deighan’s se-
cond place finish at 134 pounds,
Ray Gross began a run of five
consecutive championships for
Washington and Lee following a
first round pin with a 9-2 verdict
in the finals. The championship
was the second straight for the
talented sophomore, whose
outstanding abilities make him
a good prospect to continue his
ODAC career undefeated in the
next two years. .

Jim Flippen captured the 150
pound crown with a 12-6 win in
the finals. The championship
concluded a strong late season
rush for Flippen, whose per-
formance’ improved greatly
when he dropped down from 158
pounds in January.

Dave Stoeffel became the on-
ly freshman on the squad to
capture first place honors when
he marched through the 158
pound division unscored upon,
registering two pins. Stoeffel,
who wrestled at 167 pounds dur-
ing the regular season, was
moved down for the tournament
to increase his chances for a ti-
tle, Coach Franke’s strategy
proved flawless.

For the second consecutive
year the ODAC’s top wrestler

 

came from W&L as Ed Rodgers
captured the coveted MVP
award won last year by Jim
Crytzer. Rodgers, who won the
title at 150 last year and wrestl-
ed at 158 throughout most of this
year, met the challenge of mov-
ing up to 167 easily, gaining a
bye in the first round before pin-
ning his opponent in the finals
after only 95 seconds of wrestl-
ing.

The most evenly balanced
division in the tournament was
at 177 pounds, where Tom Oxen-
dine won the championship by a
narrow 7-4 score. Oxendine,
who struggled throughout the
early part of the season, match-
ed his brilliant performance in
Boston by earning the teams
sixth individual championship
of the evening.

Following Dan Kniffen’s loss
in the finals of the 190 pound
division, the Generals captured
their seventh individual title of
the meet in the heavy weight
division as Warren Mowry
followed a first round pin with
an 8-1 triumph in the finals.
Mowry, who only began to wres-
tle competitively last year, has

showed phenominal improve-
ment throughout the year, as in-
dicated by his strong per-
formance in the conference
tournament.

Following their ODAC
triumph, the Generals took it on
the chin in a tri-meet with
Madison and American Univer-
sity on Fancy Dress Saturday.
With the conference champion-
ship already behind them and
the National Tournament just
around the corner, the team
gave its most dissappointing
showing of the season falling
toMadison 21-15 and_ to
American by a 24-12 count. The
double loss left the Generals
with a 9-8 record in duel meets
and their second consecutive
undefeated ODAC title.

All that remains now for the
Generals is the NCAA Division
III nationals, to be held this
weekend in Wheaton, Illinois.
The team will be represented by
Howdy Knipp, Ray Gross, Dan
Kniffen and Ed Rodgers who
needs only one win to tie Jim
Crytzer’s season record of 25
victories established last
season.

Winter indoor track team

finishes 3rd in ODAC meet

by Neil Cote

The Washington and Lee in-
door track team finished a dis-
tant third place in the 1978 In-
door Track Championships held
at the Wake Fieldhouse at Lyn-
chburg College on Feb. 25.

Lynchburg College won the
meet win a total of 93 points.

Bridgewater College was se-
cond with 75 points, W&L third
with 37 and Emroy and Henry

~ was fourth with 30.

Lynchburg dominated the
meet, winning seven out of 15
events, and finishing second
five times. Bridgewater won

four, and both W&L and E&M
won two.

W&L’s Phil Dunlay won the
35 pound weight throw for the
second consecutive year with a
40-foot heave.

The Generals’ two-mile relay
team of Richard Bird, Bill Mor-
ris, Bill Welch and Chris Daniel
won their event and set a new
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference record with a time of
8:25.5, beating the 8:34.7 mark
set last year by Lynchburg.

Lynchburg’s Jerry Stroop,
who won the triple jump, the 60-

yard high hurdles and helped
his team win the 440 yard relay,
was chosen ‘‘Performer of the
Year’’ by ODAC coaches.
Stroop’s coach, Aubrey Moon,

was named “Coach of the
Year.”’

Lacrosse: W&L rite
of spring returns

by Neil Cote

W&L lacrosse coach Jack
Emme r will have to solve a pro-
blem before his stickmen start
their season against Duke
University at Durham, N.C.,
this Saturday.

Some time before then, the
former All-American
defenseman from Rudgers will
have to decide whether to start
second-team All American
Charlie Brown or sophomore
Bob Clements, who according to
Emmer did a ‘‘spectacular job”’
last year in goal.

Rival coaches wish they had
Emmer’s problem.

The Generals have similar
“problems” on attack and in
the midfield.

These ‘‘problems,’’ however,
may not be enough to pusy aside
Maryland, Cornell, Johns
Hopkins and other perrenial
lacrosse powers.

Emmer, whose teams have
won 60 of 78 games during his

five years at W&L, concedes
that larger schools that give out
athletic scholarships start the
season with an advantage.

Neither the Generals’
lacrosse team nor Emmer,
however, are about to be
discouraged because W&L, ac-
cording to Emmer, has
something other schools do not.

What W&L has, that other
schools do not, is unparralleled
pride and support from the
students, the faculty and the
local community and this has
helped the Generals win many
games, Emmer said.

“‘We don’t have scholarships
and lazy academic standards
for athletes but we make it work
in our favor,’ the blonde
lacrosse coach said. ‘ The
tremendous enthusiasm we get
from the campus and the com-
munity helps motivate us and
make our job easier.”’

Regardless of how much sup-
port the team gets from the

Glee Club singers

The Washington and Lee Glee
Club will be giving a sneak
preview of what it intends to
perform on its upcoming tour of
Mexico during a concert on
Tuesday, March 7 in Lee Chapel
at8 p.m.

The concert will feature
Hollins’ chorus and a combined
W&L-Hollins rendition of
Haydn’s ‘‘Requiem Mass.”’

W&L’s selection will range
from the beautifully sacrosanct
“Ave Maria,” to an eerily
romantic arrangement of °
“Down in the Valley,”’ to theoff-
key, off-beat “Ballad of Little
Musgrave.” To liven things up,
a variety of black spirituals will
punctuate the evening.

community, Emmer said
players in some positions will
have to get over inexperience
before the Generals can start
thinking of the playoffs.

The main area of concern, ac-
cording to Emmer, is on
defense where the loss of five
lettermen to graduation, in-
cluding All-American Tom
Kiegler, will force the Generals
to go with four relatively un-
proven players, senior Bob
Williams and sophomores Steve
Johnson, Chris Walsh and Scott
McLam, who was converted
from midfield to defense this
year too add more size, strength
and quickness to the back lines.

Emmer’s worries about the
defense, however, are reduced
considerably because of
remarkable depth in goal.

“Goal is our team’s strongest
area, and I honestly believe we
have the best goalie situation in
the country,” Emmer said.

The Generals’ midfield will
be the teams’ second-biggest
advantage, according to Em-
mer. Although losing Jack
Dudley and Doug Fuge to
graduation, the midfield should
be at least as strong as it was
last year. Returning to the
W&L lineup are Jay Sindler,
Mark Derbyshire, Joe Olive,
Roman Kupecky, Sandy
McDonald and Charlie Steiff,
who was second only to Kiegler
with 94 ground balls.

On attack, the Generals have
all their starters back for
another year, with the excep-
tion of Chris Kearney, who
withdrew from the university
last year.

Although Kearney led the

  
   

team in scoring in 1977, Emmer
said he did not expect his
presence to be_ missed.
Kearney, despite his points
scored, was often inconsistant
and made too many mistakes,
Emmer said.

Much of the Generals’ offen-
sive punch should be supplied
by attackmen Johnny Black
and Honorable mention All-
American Jeff Fritz, who com-
bined for 55 goals and 54 assists
last spring. Kearney’s slot
should be filled by one of four
condendors: sophomores Jay
Foster and Rob Eisdorfer or
freshmen Ron Hiltz or Pere
Roberts.

Even if the defense holds up

they are to better last year’s
11-4 record. W&L will face a

REVIEW and OUTLOOK LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry
Government decried Law student condemns EC

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The E.C. had its day in “‘court’’ Tuesday, trying to persuade the
Publications Board to adopt an amendment to its constitution
which would have had the effect of requiring University publica-
tions not to print the names of anyone involved in an honor trial.
The Publications Board, to its everlasting credit, told the E.C. to
get lost.

When Nixon sought to enjoin the publication of the Pentagon
Papers, he invoked the concept of ‘‘national security.’’ The E.C.
chose to invoke the concept of the honor system. In any cloak it
means one thing: Government’s attempt to subvert the First
Amendment. It is censorship, plain and simple.

In normal circumstances, the Ring-tum-Phi does not print the
name of anyone involved in an honor trial. In fact, the Ring-tum-
Phi had learned more than two weeks earlier that the the student in
question had been convicted, but chose to withhold the information
in deference to the honor system. Only after weeks of E.C. inaction
did the Ring-tum-Phi realize something had to be done and the E.C.
was not willing to do it. The student’s continued presence on cam-
pus made a mockery of the honor system the E.C. is sworn to
uphold. When theRing-tum-Phi printed the story, it was with the in-
tent to uphold the honor of the University by spurring the ap-
propriate persons on campus. Action has since been taken.

In studied contrast, the wheels of government seemed to turn
much quicker against the Ring-tum- Phi after it printed the name
of the honor defendent. Three days after the article appeared, the
Ring-tum- Phi editors were treated to a seething attack for their
lack o: moral rectitude. Mike Missal was also attacked for the
guidance he gave the Ring-tum-Phi in the writing of the article.

The :unny thing is that the man responsible for most of the vitriol,
E.C. President Jim Underhill, had talked extensively with the
Ring-tsim-Phi about the honor trial. In fact, he suggested we should
print the whole story if the defendent told him he was going public.
One R:P editor suggested to Underhill that it might preclude the
possibility of a fair trial. Underhill agreed. While Underhill was ad-
mittediv speaking off the record, his attack on Missal borders on
the hypocritical. If E.C. members shouldn’t talk about honor cases,
they sl.ouldn’t talk at all.

However, we believe in this instance that it was beneficial to the
honor system for an E.C. member to be frank. Mike Missal’s
courage should be applauded. He was the only E.C. member to take
a strong stand on the controversy. The E.C.’s attempt to expurgate
its irresponsibility by excoriating Mike Missal and by harassing the
Ring-tum-Phi should be seen as no less than a cover-up for its
failure to carry out the spirit of the honor system.

The «ope for the future is that Jim Underhill will adhere to his
campaign statement made in the March 3, 1977 Ring-tum-Phi:
‘The president’s primary objective must be to maintain the honor
syster. for the Washington and Lee community. I feel that this can
best be accomplished not by rigid adherence to the White Book, but
rather by interpretation of the principle of honor by students
dedicated to objective justice and sensitive to changing attitudes
and vaiues of the W&L community.”

The Ring-tum-Phi agrees completely with this statement. The
Phi and Mike Missal tried to maintain the credibility of the honor
system.

Legitimate issues raised by the Rtp to be considered are: Who is
responsible for seeing a student a student leaves the W&L com-
munity? Dean John says the E.C. The E.C. consitution says the
E.C. The answer—the E.C.Also should the ‘24 hour rule’’ be
reinstated? The rule, rescinded a few years ago, requires anyone
convicted of an honor offense to leave the W&L community within
24 hours. Reinstating the 24 hour rule is appropriate to ostracize an
Lonor offender.

Dear Editor:

I usually prefer to remain a
silent observer of campus
politics, but recent EC action
and particularly the stand
taken by Tom Healy, senior law
representative, require me to
voice my opinion publicly.
Although W&L is not the “real
world,”’ the University with the
Executive Committee serving a
triple function as executive,
legislature, and judiciary does
affect recognizable student
rights through its actions. This
is especially true at an institu-
tion with an honor system which
requires sanctions for viola-
tions of student mores. Here,
the only police force to be con-
tended with is the Student Con-
trol Committee, the only judge
and jury we shall ever have is
the Executive Committee, the
only defense to be gained is the
Law School. and the only
representative of free press
with its idealistic funct-on of
guarding the liberty of the peo-
ple are the Ring-tum Phi and
the Law News.

Unfortunately, the Executive
Committee and the STudent
Control Committee have chosen
to remain different from the
“real world’ in one respect.
Although a person’s natural
rights are often violated in the
real world, the Bill of Rights of-
fers protection. This is especial-
ly true in protection of rights of
persons charged with crimes
and protection of the rights to
free speech and the press. We
can lament the many instances
of violation of these rights, but
we can point, at least, to vin-
dication of these required by
our Constitution. We can go to
the courts and pray for such
vindication, hopefully receiving
our just due. At W&L, I am
ashamed to say, there are very
few rights recognized and of-
fered to students. I was per-
sonally privy to a story of how a
Student Control member ob-
tained a written confession by
devious means from a student
charged with honor violation.
This confession could have been
used against the student in a
“real’’ court, much less the
shoddy tribunal which hears
honor violations on this cam-
pus. I reported this instance to
an EC member hoping for
specific recommendations to
Student Control so that student
rights would have a concrete
basis and would be protected in
the future. Student Control
received a slap-on-the-hand ad-
monition from e EC. No specific
guidelines issued and my own
EC representative, Mr. Healy,
was heard to say ‘I don’t think
we should tell SAC what to do.”’
I ask you now, Mr. Healy, if you
don’t tell SAC what to do, who
shall? I suppose it’s quite

alright not to protect student °

rights in this manner. However,
if you have a smoking habit, I
would advise you for your own
protection to cease. Big Brother
MeNider may be watching you.

The latest EC/Healy atroci-
ty was their attempt to censor
the Ring-tum Phi. Because a
convicted honor felon remained

on campus, selling T-shirts he
was unauthorized to have made
and boasting that he would at-
tend Fancy Dress, honor viola-
tion notwithstanding, thePhi
printed a _ story. which
represented a basic problem of
enforcement with the honor
system. Mike Missal is to be
congratulated on his attempts
to ensure the honor felon’s
departure from the W&L com-
munity. The rest of the EC ap-
parently did nothing. Then they
had the gall to criticize the Phi
for its story and go before the
Publications Board demanding
censorship in matters of honor.
The Ring-tum Phi passed up the
biggest story of this year in not
printing the gory details of an
appointed officials’s nisuse of
his position. In printing a story
only after the convicted honor
felon had publicized his story by
his own actions, the Phi did not
act in contempt of a confidential
honor matter. Mr. Healy should
know that one’s right to privacy
may be diminished by one’s
own actions. The Phi violated
no confidentialities as this in-
dividual had sacrificed any con-
f Jence owning him by his own
outrageous behavior.

Worst of all, the EC decided
by its actions this week that
violating a few student rights is
not enough. Faced with a
newspaper that acted conscien-
tiously in its treatment of an
honor matter, the EC demand-
ed censorship through. the
Publications Board’s adoption
of a new newspaper policy.
True, Mr. Healy, First Amend-
ment rights may not vest legal-
ly in the newspaper of a private
college. -I am _ appalled,
however, that my own student
government and my own
elected representative do not
respect the privilege of free
speech and a free press whether
or not it is legally mandated.
Luckily, the Publications Board
declined the EC’s kind offer to
end free press on the W&L cam-
pus. It is a shame that Rick
Goddard is no longer on the Ex-
ecutive Committee. I propose
we substitute the Publications
Board for our preset present
EC. By their record they have
shown more respect for student
rights.

The

Other
Side

Dear Mr. Editor,

Recent publicity surrounding
the dismissal of a student from
the University for violation of
the Honor System has stirred
considerable discussion about
the right of an accused student
to have his identity and the
facts of his closed hearing held
in strict confidence. ,

- Undoubtedly, the respon-
sibility for the ensuring the con-
fidentiality of honor pro-
ceedings rests primarily with
the members of the Executive
Committee. Regrettably,
several members of the E.C.
failed to adhere to this princi-
ple. Although some information
inevitably leaks out whenever a
student is convicted of an honor
offense--the E.C. does not
operate in a vaccuum--we
recognize that there is an ex-
|press obligation, stated in the
White Book, that mandates
strict confidentiality with
respect to an individual honor
trial.

Unfortunately, the Ring-tum-
Phi feels unconstrained by any
such policy of confidentiality.
At a recent meeting of the
Publications Board, the Board
was asked to clarify its policy
concerning publication of in-
formation relating to specific
honor trials. The response was
that confidentiality will be
observed, except when deemed
‘“‘newsworthy’’. When asked to
consider a resolution that would
affirm the right of an accused
student to have his identity kept
out out of print, the Publications
Board responded with the
predictable litany of prior cen-
sorship and first amendment
priorities.
Board has failed to recognize its
obligation under the Honor
System. .

The editors of the Phi justify
revealing the identity of the stu-
dent in the first sentence of the
front page article as being in-
cidental to the news story about
the student’s continued
presence on campus after his
conviction. Admittedly, the
responsibility for removal of a
convicted student is open to

r baseball coach with a good
ayer of snow outside and
james less than a month away,
vhat would he have his team
lo? The logic of practicing in-
loors in this situation sure
nakes a lot of sense to me.

In regard to soccer, Mr.
Aastrilli shows .a_ great
lisregard for detail. The group
if athletes who play indoor soc-
‘er are a sanctioned club of the
iniversity ; they are not the soc-
‘er team. There is no restric-
ion of membership in the soc-
‘er club; we welcome all in-
erested parites and have many
non-soccer players involved.
3y the way, the soccer players
lid enjoy your note of en-
‘ouragement. Should we even
»other to schedule any op-
yonents for next year?

As a sanctioned club of the
iniversity, we have certain
scheduling privileges. We tried
‘0 avoid causing any conflicts so
we asked for permission to use
the gym at times when there
would be no problems. Instead
of using prime time in the after-
noon, we’ve gone in the evening
when the new gym is left free,
and on Saturday mornings at

Dear Editor,

I am writing not in reference
to any of your previous articles
but on another subject since I
feel this is the only way that this
problem will get publicized.

Forty days ago I broke a light
fixture in Davis dorm and paid
my fine for this offense. The
light fixture has not been
replaced and neither has the
one that was broken in the
month of September. I have
questioned my dorm counselor
on the subject and he can offer
no information on it. But is not
his problem. The fault lies in the
Buildings and Grounds Depart-
ment. Both checks have been
processed for these light fix-
tures, but alas no light fixture
has been replaced. I paid my
money and DEMAND that the
MAINTENCE DEPARTMENT
either refund my money or
replace these fixtures. I wonder

where my money went since it

obviously did not go to the right
place.

Shaver last Friday morning
tried to get a warrant issued
against Pollock according to a
police report, but Rockbridge
County Judge Holstein declined
to issue a warrant because of in-
sufficient evidence.

Pollock was not present, and
has yet to be questioned on the
fight by the SCC, whose chair-
man Jim McNider would issue
no comment.

When asked how he got the
bottle into the gym, Pollock said
no one checked him when he
came through the gym door. He
was one of many students who
managed to get bottles into the
gym as observed by the Phi,
mainly due to an apparent
misunderstanding between the
SAB and IFC.

IFC president Steve Mattesky
and SAB chairman Bill Tucker
both blame each other for not
having adequate security to
stop students from bringing li-
quor into the gym. Mattesky
said the SAB did not help mat-
ters by having Coca-Cola serv-
ed outside the gym, because the
soft drink is often used for mix-
ing liquor.

The security gaffe goes back
to December when SAB chair-
man Bill Tucker told IFC that
the only way there could be a
concert was if someone else
could be brought in to help set-
upequipment for the band and
provide security at all en-
trances. He asked the IFC to
provide the manpower.

Tucker said in December he
asked Mattesky if he could
organize the needed manpower
because it would be difficult for
SAB members to get the Stu-
dent Center ready for Fancy
Dress and work at the concert
at the same time. Mattesky said
the misunderstanding came
when he thought he had made it
clear to Tucker that working
the concert should be a joint ef-
fort by the IFC and the SAB.

‘Both sides thought they had
an agreement, but apparently
neither understood what the
other side needed according to
their statements. Mattesky said
the big blow to getting security
people for the concert came
when the SAB put up posters
saying that the concert was free
to all students. ‘‘This took away
the incentive that anyone would
have. for wanting to work
security at the concert,’ said
Mattesky, “because why would
anyone want to put up with the
responsibility of working at a
concert to save money, when he

can go for free.’’ Mattesky said
he informed Tucker of this pro-
blem when the SAB chairman
came to an IFC meeting the
Tuesday before Fancy Dress
weekend. Tucker had gone to
the meeting to see what ar-
rangements had been made to
that point, and was distressed
when he learned that no ar-
rangements had yet been made,
because of athletic department
pressure to prepare security for
the concert.

Mattesky told Tucker it would
be difficult to get students to
work for nothing and advised
Tucker that he could probably
get 10 students or so to work for
$5 a piece. Tucker, according to
Matteksy, told the IFC if it
wanted to pay the people that
would be fine. But according to
Tucker, Mattesky told Tucker
that since the concert was an
SAB function and the SAB
should pay for its own security
personnel. Tucker told the Phi
that since the IFC took on the
responsibility of getting the peo-
ple then they should have to
“follow through’’. ‘‘I was temp-
ted to hire the people myself,”’
said Tucker, ‘‘and then send the
IFC the bill, but I never did.”’

Mattesky said he thought he
gave Tucker the impression
that if money was not supplied
by the SAB for security, then
there would not be any. Tucker
left the Tuesday ngiht meeting
he said feeling that the IFC was
still responsible for getting the
needed people.

When Thursday night rolled
around, so to speak, there was
no security. In fact, according
to Tucker, there was no one to
help the band set up or unload
equipment.

Tucker said he had to get
Coach Miller to hire three men
at $20 a piece to work at the gym
entrances. Mattesky eventually
did show up, with his friend Ed
Burgess, but no else, said
Tucker.

Mattesky said that Tucker
could have taken his suggestion
to hire 10 students at $5 a piece
and saved money. Tucker said
he and the rest of the SAB voted
down Mattesky’s suggestion
because tbey felt since the IFC
had originally taken the respon-
sibility they should have to
follow through.

“The SAB get free admission

to Fancy dress and SAB films
along with other events,” said
Mattesky, “‘they have a lot of in-
centive, but who wants to work
for nothing.”’ Mattesky added,
‘Tucker is just not a man of his
word.’’ Tucker did not comment
on the statement but asked the
question as to how long or how
much the IFC worked on getting
security people at the concert,
leaving doubt as to whether
they had done any work at all.

“We had to work all night
Thursday and late on Friday to
get Fancy Dress ready,”’ and
SAB member Ton McCarthy,
“the IFC agreed to get security
and didn’t get off their duffs and
follow through.”’

Tucker said the SAB was not
legally responsible for the inci-
dent which occurred at the con-
cert last Thursday night, ad-
ding if any liquor got into the
gym it was the responsibility of
Assistant Athletic Director
Dick Miller and his men.

Board supports Phi

(continued from page 1) '
Charlie Hulfish, abused the
Honor Code.

“The Ring-tum Phi staff felt
that Hulfish made a mockery of
the Honer System by hanging
around,” he said. Gallagher
said that he felt it necessary
that the student body be aware
of Hulfish’s actions.

In other business, Gallagher’s
request that Phi staff members
Lee Howard and Jim Barnes be
reimbursed by the Publications
Board for financing with their
own mosey four pages of last
week's 16-page paper was
defeated by the board, 3-2.

The ewspaper’s business
manager, Pete Goss, had said
earlier in the week that the
paper would be 12 pages and
that he would not agree to
finance a 16-page issue.

Barnes and Howard then said
they would pay for the other
four pages ‘‘out of their own
pockets,’ according to
Gallagher. The two supported
their actions by saying that the
paper is iraditionally larger the
week before Fancy Dress and
that, due to the large amount of
copy they had received, a 12-
page issue would be cramped
and not :s pleased not as pleas-
ing to the reader’s eye as the 16-
page edition. Barnes also said
that a 15-page issue would ‘‘look
good to (visiting) alumni.”

Owen argued that much of the
issue was “‘filler’’ that could
have been used at any time and
that Barnes and Howard had
agreed to finance the extra four
pages themselves.

The cost of printing the extra
four pages was put at “‘about
$130” by Dave McLean, ex-
business manager for the
newspaper. Gallagher put the
cost at ‘approximately $100.

Mahon competition opens

by M. GrayColeman

The Department of English
has recently announced the
opening of competition for the
annual Mahan Awards in
creative writing.

Each award consists of a $100
exemption from college fees
during the year following the
one in which the award is made,
or an alternative option of $60 in
cash.

A maximum of five awards
may be given each year by the
Mahan committee: two
freshman prose awards, one
sophomore and junior prose
award each, and a verse award
for all classes except
graduating seniors.

All entries must be submitted
by noon on April 28 to the
secretary of the English depart-
ment in Payne 31. Each contes-
tant is urged to keep a copy of
his entry since the department
cannot be responsible for lost
manuscripts.

Decisions will be reached
sometime in May, and will be
announced in the June com-
mencement program. Award-
winning entries become the pro-
perty of the University; all
other entries may be picked up
after the announcement of win-
ners.

The Mahan Awards were
created due to the generosity of
George Addison Mahan. Born in
Missouri in 1851, he attended
Bethel College before his
graduation from Washington
and Lee in 1870. After gradua-
tion, Mahan moved to Hannibal,
Missouri, renowned as_ the
home of Mark Twain. In fact, he
became quite active in the ef-
forts to preserve the memory of
his town’s greatest resident.
Finally, he bought the Mark
Twain home in the town and
gave it to the city authorities as
a memorial, also erecting a
mtribute to the writer and

 

 

humorist.

Upon his death in the 1930’s,
he left W&L a legacy of $10,000
which the Board of Trustees
decreed was to be set to endow
prize scholarships for creative
writing.”

Other rules and regulations
for the competition should be
picked up from the English
department’s secretary as soon
as possible. The committee en-
courages aS many entries as
possible, though no indiviudal
may submit more than two pro-
se entries and one verse entry.
And, no awards will be made in
any class, unless in the opinion
