NUMBER 11

Kirby denies access to public records Goddard

the Free Press Fair Trial J; challenged by the Ring-tum Phi

by Randolph P. Smith

Police Chief James A. Kirby,
in a recent interview, said that
his fear of libel action is one of
the primary reasons behind the
Lexington Police Department’s
policy of refusing to release the
names of persons arrested or
issued court summonses.

Kirby made the statement in
an effort to justify the Depart-
ment’s official policy of ‘“‘deny-
ing access” to the general
public and press information
relating to arrest records and
summonses until such time as
they have been entered on the
court record. The policy has
been formally challenged by the
Ring-tum Phi.

It is the contention of the

' Ring-tum Phi that Virginia’s

Freedom of Information Act re-
quires all arrest records: and
court summonses to be open for
inspection by the public and the
press immediately after an ar-
rest or execution of a summons.

J. Michael Gallagher, editor
of the Ring-tum Phi, said that
“immediate access should be
given to the name of the accus-
ed, his age, his residence, his
employment, family
backbround, and other brief
facutal background relative to
the charge.’’ Gallagher pointed
out that his position is very
similar to the one expressed in

W&L students

lose *3,000
to burgulars

by Heartsill Ragon

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity students have reported to
police that over $3,000 in stereo
and electronic equipment was
stolen from student apartments
over the Thanksgiving break.

One apartment’s larceny
report showed a total of $1,725
worth of equipment was lost to
burgulars.

According to Lexington police
chief J. A. Kirby, six student
housing . facilities reported
break-ins over the five-day holi-
day. Kirby said apartments at
108 Randolph St., 3 University
Place, and 302 S. Jefferson St.
reported thefts of stereo equip-
ment, television sets, clock

radios and a rifle.
In addition to break-ins at

these apartments, the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Phi Gamma
Delta fraternity houses
reported thefts to city police of-
ficials.

Also, one W&L student’s dor-
matory room was broken into.
Police report that the burgulars
apparently had access to a
spare key to that room.

(continued on page 9)

Voluntary Guidelines adopted
by the Virginia Bar Association
and Virginia Press Association.

Kirby explained that the
Police Department’s policy was
initiated by the former Chief, A.
E. Rhodenizer, in 1974. The
policy was formed out of the
Department’s interpretation of
the Privacy Protection Act of
1974. .

Although he did not initiate
the policy of withholding the
names of those arrested or
issued court summonses, Kirby
said he was in full support of the
policy. When the policy was

in connection with specific
police actions, Chief Kirby
sought legal assistance.

In a later interview, Kirby
said that City Attorney William
O. Roberts had told him that he

has the authority to withhold
the names of persons arrested
and circumstances surrounding
their arrest until such time as
they have been entered on the
court record. /

In a letter dated November
10, 1977, Roberts cited two
statutes as the legal justifica-
tion for the Police Depart-

ment’s policy. Roberts declared.

that the authority to withhold
the names of those arrested or
given summonses is included in
Virginia’s Freedom of Informa-
tion Act.

The expressed written intent
of the Freedom of Information
Act states that it was the pur-
pose of the General Assembly
“to ensure to the people of this
Commonwealth ready access to
records in the custody of public
officials.” The policy of the Act
further recognizes that ‘‘the af-
fiars of government are not in-
tended to be conducted in an at-
mosphere of secrecy since at all

No leads in Pika fire

by Ned McDonnell

Thus far, no arrests have
been made in connection with
last week’s smokebomb fire at
Pi Kappa Alpha.

The investigation team of a
Virginia state arson squad, the
Lexington Fire Department,
and the Police Department
have uncovered two suspects
says Fire Chief Charles Conner.
But Conner would make no fur-
ther comments or speculations
on the nine to fourteen thousand
dollars of estimated damage
wreaked on the fraternity house
by vandals. A check with other
fraternities revealed that three
others, Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma
Phi Epsilon and Kappa Alpha,
had similiar incidents the same
night.

The conflagration, discovered
by Pi Kappa Phi junior Chris
Volk who, meeting a Sweet
Briar lass to arrange a ride
back for her to school, walked
into the stricken fraternity
house about five or ten minutes
after one o’clock. Volk noticed
that an upholstered armchair
was on fire. He, realizing that
the fire was too intense for him

_to control single handedly,

quickly called the Police
Department to report the blaze.
As Volk made his call, PIKA
president Robert Sundberg, not
able to detect any wrongdoing
at this point, discovered the fire
and rushed to get the few
PIKAs, who had not gone to the
Munster House party, out of the
house.

Sophomore Norris Leffitte,
the first house resident down
the stairs, started the fire
fighting effort with the aid of
some Phi Delts. By this time,
however, the fire on the chair
had ignited a nearby sofa which
fed the flames to the drapes. At
this time, paint burst into
flames thereby engulfing the
whole room in destructive fiery
tongues. By the time the fire
department arrived to the
scene, the PIKAs and PHI

DELTS led by Leffitte (who suf-
fered slight burns on his hands),
armed with garden hoses and
fire extinguishers, had pretty
much put an end to the disaster.
The fire department remained
on the scene until safety from
reignition was assured.

Coincidentally, the fire came
less than 12 hours after fraterni-
ty had undergone an inspection
for possible fire hazards by
university officials and an in-
dependent inspector.

Lexington Fire Chief Charles
Conner confirmed Thursday

afternoon the extensive damage

included a partially charred
stereo, destroyed speakers, and
ob literated IM trophies and

plaques. Composite photos of
fraternity members survived
the blaze relatively unscathed.
Only the frames of these pic-
tures, of high sentimental value
and obviously irreplacable,
were lost.

Just after the fire, Dean of
Students Lewis John offered Pi
Kappa Alpha the full assistance
of the university. However,
fraternity president Sundberg
feels that the insurance com-
pany will cover all losses stem-
ming from the vandalism.

Sundberg, summarizing the
close call, said, “We're just
lucky it happened when it did. If
it had started at 3 a.m., we
might all be dead.”

resigns

by Lee Howard

Rick Goddard shocked the
Executive Committee Monday
night by announcing his
resignation, effective Jan. 2.

Goddard told the committee
he simply did not have enough
time to put into EC activities. In
forewarning theRing-tum Phi of
his resignation, Goddard
specifically mentioned a six
hour honor trial a couple of
weeks ago as an example of the
extraordinary time re-
quirements put on EC
members. Goddard is the senior
EC law representative.

Goddard’s leadership and
crusading style will be sorely
missed by the EC. Estimates of
the percentate of EC motions
Goddard was responsible for
this year range upward of 75 per
cent.

Goddard’s most important
acheivements in his 12years on
the EC were in the areas of
honor defendants rights and the
openness of government. He
was instrumental in passing
new honor code regulations
which required that the EC
must give a defendant at least
24 hours notice before an honor
trial can be held. The previous
regulations had required a
minimum of three hours.

Goddard also suggested the
EC be required to give a defen-
dant a written explaination of
the charge against him, as well

! Brate become

by Tom Salley

Outside of their social functions, a growing
number of Washington and Lee fraternities have
recently undertaken several community service
projects for local charities. Blood drives, Halloween
and Christmas parties for local children, and fund
raising projects have become almost as common as
the Wednesday night grain party. This is not a
chance occurence; some houses have community
service projects as a part of their unwritten by-
laws, while others have undertaken such projects as
a means to improve fraternity-town relations.
Whatever the motivation, these houses have
created constructive alternatives to the standard
fraternity activities.

Leading the list of civic-minded fraternities are
the ZBT’s, the Sigma Chi’s, and the Lambda Chi’s.
Contributing to a lesser extent are the Phi Psi’s, the
Pi Kapp’s, the KA’s, and the Fiji’s. The remainder
of the fraternities bring up the rear.

The Zeta Beta Tau chapter has been active in
community service in Lexington. Most recently, the
ZBT’s have completed a highly successful fund rais-
ing campaign for Unicef, collecting over $175 from
both students and local residents. The house has
also organized Easter Egg and Christmas parties
for local children, provided workers for the Na-
tional Association for Retarded Children’s Field
Day, and produced, for three out of four years, the
highest percentage of contributors in the annual
College Republican’s Blood Drive. For their efforts
over the past few years the ZBT’s have won two

Civic minded

trophies from the national organization in recogni-
tion of their community service.

The Sigma Chi’s have also been active in fulfilling
their civic responsibilities; they have assisted the
College Republicans in the Blood Drive, hosted a
Halloween party for local orphans, and entered a
good percentage of their membership in the M.S.
Walk-a-thon, either as walkers or sponsors.
Presently, they are looking for a suitable project to
serve as this year’s pledge project, which, in the
past, has been geared towards a community need.

The Lambda Chi’s, early aware of the
deteriorating state of town-gown relations, began a
series of civic-minded projects in an effort to im-
prove the image of the: fraternities among the
townspeople. Having appointed a special Public
Relations Chairman, the Lambda Chi’s last spring
organized a house litter project to clean up that fre-
quently abused recreation spot, Twin Falls. This
year they pan to hold a Senior Citizen’s Service Day
where the house members would be available to
elderly citizens for house and yard work at no cost.
And as a means to alleviate some of the complaints
from neighbors about noisy parties, the Lambda
Chi’s have instituted a policy of inviting all their
neighbors to their parties.

The Phi Psi’s have organized a car wash to raise
money for a relief fund for needy families, and
entered their pledges in last year’s Walk-a-thon.
The Pi Kapp’s helped the local March of Dimes
organization last year by going on a door-to-door

Lexington city ordinances
specify that persons using
stereo equipment loud enough
to be heard by ‘“‘the public’’ dur-
ing any part of the day must
first obtain a written permit
from the city manager’s office.

The often quoted city or-
dinance 15-32(b) makes specific
the hours between 11:00 p.m.
and 7:00 a.m., and a distance of
fifty feet as the criteria to be us-
ed for judging noise level. But
Section 15-33 states generally
that “‘except in public emergen-
cy’’ it is unlawful to use ‘‘sound-
amplifying equipment or
loudspeakers, in such a manner
that the sound or noise thereof
is audible to the public, without
a written permit from the city
manager.”’

Section 15-33 is important
especially in regard to the up-
Poo fraternity Christmas

 

house parties weekend. In order
not to be in violation of 15-33,
fraternity officers should obtain
a written permit from the city
manager.

But the permit will expire at
11 o’clock when 15-32(b) takes
effect. Fraternities ‘“‘producting
or reproducing sound’’ so as to
“disturb the peace, quiet and
comfort of the neighboring in-
habitants” (or sound heard
more than fifty feet away) after
11 p.m. take their own chances
for police intervention.

Sigma Phi Epsilon, already
fined for violation of the noise
ordinance, was quick to apply
for their permit. Social chair-
man Joe Scott, went to the city
manager’s office before the
Thanksgiving break, but his
hope was to obtain an extension
of the ordinance until midnight.

“‘We were told by the IFC that
the city manager could extend

for daytime stereo play

the ordinance until 12 p.m., but
his secretary only gave us a
permit from 8-12. They’ve
already nailed us once, we just
don’t want to get hasseled
again.”

President of the Interfraterni-
ty Council, Steve Mattesky, ex-
plained that city administrators
were very cautious in their
discussion about the noise or-
dinance with him. They told
him that the time limitation
might be extended. Thus far it
has not.

If they choose to enforce
15-33, the Lexington police can
stop any party—at any hour of
the day—where the noise level
is, in their opinion, ‘‘audible to
the public.” The purpose of the
written permit is to register the
party with the city and to gain
permission for the use of stereo
equipment until 11:00 p.m.

Automatic rule meeting planned

The Committee on the
Automatic Rule will meet at
10:30 a.m. on Wednesday,
December 21, 1977. At that time
the Committee will consider the
following groups of students,
who have fallen under the
Automatic Rule, for possible
immediate reinstatement:

(1) those students who failed
to meet the conditions of
Academic Probation required
of them at the end of the current
Fall Term.

(2) those students completing
a full academic year who failed

to meet the cumulative average
required of their class.

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement
all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of extenuating circumstances
present in his case, he may
write a letter to the Committee
and deliver it to the Office of the
Dean of the College before the
time of the Committee’s
meeting.

In general, the Committee

grants few immediate
reinstatements. A student who
falls under the Automatic Rule
severs his connection with the
University; if the Committee
does not grant him immediate
reinstatement, he is not eligible
for reinstatement until after the
passage of at least one calendar
year.

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the
Automatic Rule will receive a
letter explaining his status.
Academic Probation

Any student who is not sub-
ject to the Automatic Rule in
December and who fails to
achieve the cumulative average
required of him at the end of the
Fall Term, 1977 (see page 71 in
Catalogue) will. receive
notification that he is on
Academic Probation for the
Winter Term, 1978.

Noise ordinance disturbs student routine

Written permit required
Phi Kap on probation

by Charle Smith

The Washington and Lee In-
terfraternity Council has placed
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity on
social probation until the end of
the fall term for an incident
which occurred during a Thurs-
day night party.

Lexington police had issued
two summonses for violations of
excessive noise. One was issued
to the Phi Kappa Sigma house
and the other to Phi Delta Theta
fraternity, which was also hav-
ing a party. In all, four frater-
nities have been found in viola-
tion of the existing noise or-
dinance.

The IFC’s disciplinary action
followed complaints by the Lex-
ington police that when the of-
ficer attempted to issue the
warrent at Phi Kappa Sigma,
he was verbally abused.

An egg was also thrown, strik-
ing the officer’s car, police said.

The officer, Ptl. J. K. Colbert,

police had told them that

was unable to find a house of-
ficer to issue the summons. A
junior member of the fraterni-
ty, Rob Calvert, accepted it.
University officials said the

Calvert was very courteous and
apologetic about the incident.

IFC President Steve Mat-
tesky said that the probation
will extend from Sunday, Nov.
28 to Friday, Dec. 16.

The incident occurred during
a party in which the fraternity
was celebrating the completion
of a social probation-penalty for
alleged violations with their
pledges, Mattesky said.

Representing Phi Kappa
Sigma at Friday’s meeting
were five members of the
fraternity, including its presi-
dent, Ben Johns. In addition to
the IFC Judicial Board, Dean of
Students Louis John and Coor-
dinator of Fraternities Dan
Murphy were at the meeting.

Dining hall rates
high in survey

by Kevin Dwyer

For at least 500 people in the
W&L community, Letitia P.
Evans Dining Hall is the
substitute for Mom’s home
cooking one or more times dai-
ly. The largest group which
dines there is, of course, the
freshman class, but many up-
perclassmen eat there, too.

No one argues about the beau-
ty of the physical plant; the
question is: Is the food worth
eating? A survey was taken by
the Ring-tum Phi three weeks
ago to determine how people
feel about the food they are get-
ting.

Twenty people were inter-
viewed each night of the survey,
which lasted one week, and the
numbers were kept static: 14
freshmen and 6 upperclassmen
each night. Those interviewed
were asked three basic ques-
tions.

1. Do you like this particular

meal?
Evaluated overall, there were
more ‘‘yes’’ answers than ‘‘no”’
ones. All in all, 48 per cent of
those surveyed said ‘‘no”’ and 52
per cent said ‘‘yes.”’

2. Do you generally like din-

ing hall food?
Here is where the dining hall
really came out on top. Over 70
per cent of those questioned
said they liked dining hall food
in general.

3. What category of food

disappoints you most?
A few people couldn’t fault any
aspect of dining hall food, but of
those who answered, over 75 per
cent said meats disappointed
them in one way or another.
Most said they wanted seconds,
and a few complained about
meat quality. The second
highest complaint concerned
vegetables, which many
thought tasteless. A few specific
things: one complained of
“‘chicken-itis,” and a few more
never want to see tomato sauce
again. Several said the dining
hall runs out of things before the
end of the dining period, and
many want more ice cream.

Overall, though, most of those
interviewed gave Jerry Darrell

and the dining hall high marks.

Darrell was interviewed last
week about his responsibilities.
This is the second year Darrell
has headed the independent
University Food Service.
Before this the dining hall was
affiliated with ARA food ser-
vices. He has found that large
national food co anies still give
him a break despite his in-
dependent status. He saves by
not having to pay ARA fees as
well.

Darrell sayd, ‘‘There’s no
reason why we can’t do a good
job. We’ve got the resources
and the supplies. So we have the
responsibility.”’

The dining hall has always ex-
perienced a lot of waste, and
Darrell says this year is no dif-
ferent. One dramatic gesture he
used to emphasize waste was to
take one lunch’s wasted sub-
marine sandwiches and put
them on display outside the
cafeteria door at dinnertime.
Many found it distasteful, but
many others felt it proved a
point.

“There were 100 sandwiches
there,’’ says Darrell. “I think
that’s way too much waste.”

This year, Darrell is overseer
of four University concerns: the
Co-op, the Cockpit, the Supply
Store, and the dining hall. He
says he’s considerably busier
this year, but it’s not too much
work because he has great help.

“Frances Davis and Dan
Scott are terrific workers,’
says Darrell. Davis is super-
visor of the Cockpit, and Scott is
an alumnus who works with
scheduling and the Music Union
for weekend live acts.

“The place is really enliven-
ed,” Darrell says, ‘‘and we owe
a lot of it to those two and the
other fine workers over there.”’

There have been numerous
complaints about how the Co-op
and Supply Store are organized
this year. Darrell defends the
system and describes it as
much faster and more efficient
for everyone, both customer
and worker .

“People must like it,’’ says
Darrell, ‘“‘since the Co-op has

already broken its sales record
twice.”’

He has praise for Famie
Smothers, a 25-year university
employee and the Co-op super-
visor and the others who work
at the Co-op and Supply Store.

“They’re happy with the new
system, too,” Darrell says.

“‘T just found out in July that I
had to manage the Co-op,” Dar-
rell says. “I refused to do it
under the inefficient conditions.
that existed there, and so a
reorganization took place.”’

Jerry Darrell says that the
reorganization was all done w
ithin the space of a week, and
that he felt it the most efficient
and sensible system. When ask-
ed why the Supply Store was
separated from the Co-op, Dar-
rell replies, ‘It’s more efficient.
The two operations differ great-
ly and it makes sense to have
them separated. Besides, the

- Supply Store loses money at

night.”’

Darrell continuously stresses
efficiency and low cost, which
he believes enables him to keep
student costs lower and helps
him to initiate things such as
the night-owl specials, Co-op
low-cost food combinations
which are changed weekly.

Only praise for the dining hall
was heard following Nov.:21’s
special Thanksgiving feast.
This reporter can testify—the
food was absolutely fantastic
and those Lex high school girls
for waitresses! It was worth
staying the whole weekend for
that meal.

Freshman vice president Bob
Willis chairs the Evans Dining
Hall Food Committee, which
meets every Thursday evening
during dinner in the dining hall.
“You're welcome to come,”
says Willis. “‘We usually move
around the dining hall from
week to week.”

Darrell appreciates and acts
on imput, both from the food
committee, and from the sug-
gestion box. But, Darrell says,
describing one useless offering
from the box, “It sucks’ isn’t a
very concrete suggestion. If it’s
a good one, we'll use it.”’

Lee-Jackson House

The year-long restoration of
the Lee-Jackson House . at
Washington and Lee University
has been completed and the
historic building has once again
become a private residence.

The house -- built in 1841-42 --
was the home of Thomas J.
(Stonewall) Jackson before the
Civil War, and of Robert E. Lee
and his family just after the
war.

The meticulous restoration
was planned and directed by J.
Everette Fauber Jr. of Lyn-
chburg, the well-known restora-
tion and preservation architect.
Part of the project involved ex-
tensive historical research,
which was carried out as the
work progressed.

Dr. and Mrs. Edward C., At-
wood Jr. have moved into the
house. Atwood is the dean of the
W&L’s School of Commerce,

Economics and Politics. The
four antebellum residences on
the Washington and Lee front
campus, including the Lee-
Jackson House, have
customarily been occupied by a
dean or senior professor ever
since they were built.

The restoration project in-
cluded repointing the exterior
brickwork and _ considerable
structural work on the wing in
which Jackson and his bride liv-
ed in 1853-54. The interior,
which had been modified only
slightly in the 135 years since
the house was built, has also
been restored faithfully.

The living and dining rooms
and the entryway in the house
are being furnished with mid-
19th-century pieces of the kind
that were in it when Jackson
and, later, the Lee family lived
there.

restored, occupied

The house was built as the of-
ficial residence of the president
of Washington College, as the
school was then known.
Stonewall Jackson, a professor
at neighboring Virginia
Military Institute, married
Eleanor Junkin, daughter of the
college president, in 1853, and
they lived with her parents. She
died 14 months after their wed-
ding, but Jackson remained a
member of the Junkin
household for several more
years.

Robert E. Lee moved into the
house when he became presi-
dent of the college five months
after Appomattox. He and his
family, which joined him short-
ly after he arrived in August,
1865, lived there until a new,
larger president’s house was
completed neyt door in 1869.

E.C. votes to allow
charge in “Pit”’

by Lee Howard

The Executive Committee
voted 6-5 Monday night to allow
the Cockpit to ask no more than
50 cents cover charge from
students during the per-
formance of Sonny Land Slim
last night.

Slom, a 70-year-pld black
blues pianist, cost the Music
Union $300 for one night’s per-
formance and the Union was
trying to alleviate the cost by
requesting the cover charge.

Dan Scott, night manager of
the Cockpit, told theRing-tum
Phi later, however, that he
thinks the Cockpit might not
charge a cover after all. He said
he thinks doing so would create
more hassle than it’s worth. He
said he had to talk to Galen
Trussell, chairman of the Music
Union to straighten the whole
thing out. Trussell requested
EC approval of the cover
charge.

The Phi went to press before
it could determine for sure
whether a cover charge had
been asked.

In any case, the EC did set a
precedent in ratifying the cover
charge. Scott said that,
although the performance by
professional entertainers
scheduled for yesterday and
this weekend will.not require a
cover charge, a possible per-
formance by Dave Van Ronk
scheduled for later this year
may have to be supplemented
by a cover.

Scott said Van Ronk inspired
such singers as Bob Dylan, Joni
Mitchell and Judy Collins
before they ‘‘sold out” to the
popular music field. Unlike the
other stars, Van Ronk is still
playing his own music, Scott
said. He added that Van Ronk
had been playing at ‘‘The Cellar
Door,”’ a famous night club in
Washington, for cover charges
of from five to eight dollars.

This weekend, Roy
Bookbinder will play in the
Cockpit, Scott said. Bookbinder
will cost the Music Union $375
for two nights, according to
Trussell.

Steve Abraham, George Grif-
fin, Chris Gammon, Rick God-
dard, Andy Bodenstab and
Doug Perkins’ voted for the

cover charge. Mike Missal,
Jack Bovay, Jim Underhill,
Neil Pentifallo and Jim Davis
voted against it.

Missal was the most vocal op-
ponent of cover charges. He
said he thinks cover charges
would exclude some students,
despite the fact that the Cockpit
should be for all students. He
also disputed Trussell’s conten-
tion that 150 students would pay
the cover charge. Trussell said
that even if the projection of 150
was a bit too high, at least a
cover would off set some of the
costs of the performer.

Trussell said the cover
charge is an experiment; the
Music Union wants to see how it
goes. He also said he had gotten
permission from James
Whitehead, W&L’s treasurer,
to impose a cover charge.

Missal later told the Phi it is
his understanding that
Whitehead told Trussell it was
alright to have a cover charge
so long as he consulted the EC
first.

In other action by the EC, it
voted unanimously to give
honor trial defendants the right
to see a copy of all physical
evidence to be used against him
in an honor trial before the trial
is held. Specifically, the
physical evidence would be
given to him when the charges
are served. This would give a
student at least 24 hours to
‘“‘prepare a meaningful
defense,’’ Goddard said. Under
new procedures passed by the
EC last year, the committee
must give a student at least 24
hours warning before an honor
trial can be held.

Griffin announced that he and
Missal had set up a pre-exam
orientation program to instruct
freshmen and upperclassmen
exactly what is expected of
them during exams. A
freshman class honor orienta-
tion seminar will be held Thurs-
day, Dec. 9 in Lee Chapel, Grif-
fin said. Additionally, letters
will be sent out to up-
perclassmen reminding them
that independent exams are on
trial, he said.

Upperclassmen, of course,
would also be encouraged to

As You Like It
to be performed Sunday

The National Shakespeare
Company will be presenting its
production of William
Shakespeare’s As You Like It
on Sunday at Doremus Gym-
nasium at8 p.m.

No more delightful setting for
romance could be created than
the forest of Arden and it is here
that Shakespeare brings to life
one of his most enchanting com-
edies. As You Like It is com-
pounded of many elements, but
the whole is set to some of
Shakespeare’s loveliest poetry.
Kindliness, good fellowship,
good-will—these are the
elements of As You Like It, and
Shakespeare shows their
degree of worth.

As You Like It involves an ex-
iled duke and his daughter
Rosalind, who has grown up
under the charge of Frederick,
the duke’s brother and usurper
of his dukedom. Eventually,
Rosalind falls in love with
Orlando, sworn enemy to the
evil duke, and, disguised as a
man, sets out to find her own
father. At least four sets of
lovers undergo antics of
mistaken identity and unre-
quited love throughout Arden’s
forest, culminating in a mass
wedding and reconciliation.

The National Shakespeare
Company’s production of As
You Like It is directed by Sue
Lawless. The retreat . from
society to the forest of Arden
suggested a directorial ap-
proach that incorporates the
music and “back to nature”
philosophy of the 1960’s.

Shakespeare on wheels—The
National Shakespeare Com-
pany, one of America’s oldest
and most respected classical
touring organizations, is
celebrating its 15th anniversary
this year. The Cubiculo, the
Company’s experimental

dance/theatre based in New
York, is honoring its 10th an-
niversary this year, and The
National Shakespeare Com-
pany Conservatory is currently
in its fifth year. It is a big year
for anniversaries and we are
proud to have The National
Shakespeare Company in Lex-
ington on Dec. 4.

The Company has earned its
enviable reputation from its
Founder, Artistic Director and
Producer, Philip Meister. Mr.
Meister started with a special
commitment to perform “‘the
classics” for audiences across
the country who would other-
wise never have such an op-
portunity. With this endeavor
and an old station wagon, The
Company took off for their first
tour.

Since then, The National
Shakespeare Company (a non-
profit organization) has per-
formed for audiences of over
250,000 per year in colleges,
universities, high schools and
cultural centers across the na-
tion. The Conservatory has ex-

panded its enrollment con-
siderably over the past few
years ; several students have, in
fact, gone on to tour with The
Shakespeare Company. The
Cubiculo has similarly expand-
ed as more and more artists are
taking advantage of its ser-
vices.

Although recognition must go
to the countless directors,
designers, actors and_ staff
members who have contributed
their efforts and talents, the
legend behind The National
Shakespeare Company is, of
course Philip Meister—a man
whose dedication, enterprise
and passion has reached au-
diences for fifteen years.

Each season’s nine-month
trek takes The National
Shakespeare Company from
Florida to the Maritimes, from
New York to California and
Canada with three plays in its
repetoire. This season includes;
As You Like It, TheWinter’s
Tale and Othello, directed by
Sue Lawless, Mario Siletti and
Philip more Meister, respec-
tively.

fers such a diversity of choice.
Through the wide variety of
subjects, there is something for
all ages: information, emotion,
humor, beauty and just plain

enjoyment. Such neat
packages.
Books last! They aren’t

swallowed at once and gone
forever; they can be relished
again and again. They can even
have a different flavor each
time of reading.

If I were a young man hunting
for a book for my best love I
would pick - say - Tolkein’s
great bestseller, The
Silamarillion, John Fowles’
Daniel Martin, the Sierra Club
Wilderness Calendar or The Art
of Kissing by Morris.

For my grandmother, who
has slipped me nice little checks
now and then, I could find The
Audubon Field Guide to Birds,
Dore’s Bible Illustrations, or
Plain and Fancy: American
Women and Their Needlework.

For my younger brother who
doesn’t think much of reading I
could entice him with Science
Fiction Tales, The Star Trek
Concordance, or Pyramid a
fascinating diagramatic book of
how the pyramids were built.

And what would I give my
father, my mother and a very
young nephew? Such ideas will
pour forth next week.

You can’t loose with a book.

**Attack on the boob tube”’

The Land of Oz

by Seth Oserin

This past vacation gave me
the rare opportunity to sample
the more renowned offerings of
the television industry. It prov-
ed to be an experience beyond
the realms of anything im-
aginable, including sanity.

The reason for all this, of
course, is that group of which
many, through the years, have
come to scorn in old age, and
which receives an amazingly
constant degree of catering
from manufacturers and adver-
tising agencies. Of course, it’s
the kids.

Now I'll grant you, the
younger group is a_ viable
market, and TV would be
foolish to omit them from their
programming. But let’s face it,
do we really need kidvid (the
name affectionately given to
Saturday morning programm-
ing) at prime time? Is it really
necessary to be able to see the
Six Million Dollar man making
it with the Bionic Woman while
the Hulk watches as Wonder
Woman gives him a back rub?

Life is too short for stupidity
such as this. However, the
worst part is that all program-
ming has been saturated with

adolescent insanity. Have you
ever seen ‘‘Laverne and

King Kong eat a Tootsie Roll.
Or how about “Three is Com-
pany.” The only saving factor

mer’s ample chest. The rest of

Who cares if there’s a gay man

“Soap,’’ the first R-rated TV
show (which means, of course,
that every kid under the age of

want children to see it has no
logic at all, especially since all
the writing is on that level.

However, in retrospect, this

beneficial. Just think, while the

- Wind Quintet Reviewed

by Robert Tremblay

The Clarion Wind Quintet liv-
ed up to its named at Lee
Chapel a few- Thursdays ago
with a concert that was certain-
ly marked by clarity and
sureness of tone. The ensemble,
which included Philip Dunigan,
flute; Robert Listokin, clarinet;
Joseph Robinson, oboe;
Frederick Bergstone, horn; and
Mark Popkin, bassoon, played a
program focusing on composers
of the late 19th century and on
20th century composers as well.

The concert began with Three
Short Pieces by the French
composer, Jacques Ibert. These
charming works were typically
French in their melodic content
and gave the quintet a chance to
demonstrate the possibilities
and variety of tone color that is
unique to this ensemble; the
French being the first nation to
really concentrate on writing
for the woodwind quintet.

Next was the demanding
Variations and Fugue on a
Theme of Handel by Brahms,
which was originally written for
piano and is a work that can be
a bit tedious in its intellectual
pursuits, but arranged here by
the group’s bassoonist, Mark
Popkin, the piece gained a little
life as well as losing about ten
minutes in length of per-
formance.

Robert Stewart’s Five Visions
followed the intermission and
was a work that impressed a
number of people who were pro-
bably expecting the clarinetist

to play his instrument from the
other end, but instead heard a
piece that in its descriptive and
cohesive power proved to be one
of the more popular pieces on
the program.

August Klughardt’s Quintet
op. 79 displayed the romantic
qualities of many beautiful
melodies and harmonies as well
as the romantic quality of not
knowing when to stop writing
these many beautiful melodies
and harmonies. But length
aside, this was a stunning piece
of music.

The concert concluded with
one of the few masterpieces
written sepcifically for wood-
wind quintet—Kleine Kammer-
musikby Paul Hindemith. Like
Ibert’s Three Short Pleces, this
work gives the quintet a chance
to show off the variety of tone
olompossible here, but, unlike
the French composition,
Hindemith places the quintet in
a far more advanced musical
atmosphere. The piece is mark-
ed by diversity of style as well
as displaying Hindemith’s own
unmistakable genius.

The concert, on a whole, was
an excellent one and no doubt
very satisfying for those who
have not heard a woodwind
quintet before. It’s a shame that
there isn’t more music written
for this ensemble, but maybe
with. a few more groups as fine
as the Clarion Wind Quintet, a
few more composers might
start concentrating on writing
for this tragically neglected
genre.

Musical M

by Mark Mainwaring

After a rather slow fall
season, the rush of Christmas
album releases if finally under-
way. These include new LPs
from Roxy Music, Alice Cooper,
Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton, and
Al Stewart, to name just a few.
Two of the more interesting
releases—from ELP and
Genesis—are reviewed in ths
week’s Mainstream.Works,
Volume 2
Emerson Lake & Palmer
Atlantic SD 19147

ELP’s Works, Vol. 1, released
last March, was a musical
breakthrough for the band, and
a frist-rate album as well. Un-
fortunately, many of the
group’s fans seem to have been
turned off by the abundance of
extended, highly orchestrated
songs on the record. Its sales
were not as good as expected,
and attendance on ELP’s subse-
quent world tour was extremely
disappointing. The press
release accompanying Works,
Volumne 2 makes a big point of
noting that the album contains
‘“‘no less than 12 compositions,
all clocking in at under five
minutes.’ Orchestration has
also been kept to a minimum.
After the underwhelming suc-
cess ofWorks, Volume 1, ELP
decided to go commercial?

It’s really hard to say. More
than anything, Works, Volume 2
is inconsistent, it just doesn’t fit
together like past ELP albums.
Five of the songs are old
singles, recorded at various

Ju paintings

on exhibit

An exhibition of 20 recent
paintings by I-Hsiung Ju will
take place during the next two
weeks in the duPont Art Gallery
at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.

Ju is associate professor and
artist-in-residence at W&L.

Ju will exhibit two kinds of
paintings. Ten will be album
leaves—paintings of rice paper
or gold leaves, mounted on
cardboard.

Ju siad he brought several
album leaves from China when
he came to the United States in
1968 and his recent rediscovery
of them inspired these new
works. They are quite small and
finely detailed paintings, he
said.

There will also be ten con-
siderably larger paintings ex-
ecuted in acrylic and oil paint.
Ju said these paintings were
done as demonstrations in the
techniques used with oil and
acrylics for his students at
W&L.

They are an experimental
compilation of images taken
from photographs of the local
landscape, Ju said. He says that
after living here for eight years
the area has made a deep im-
pression on him and his work.

Ho Hao-Tien, director of the
National Museum of History in
Taiwan, has said Ju is ‘‘one of
the few Chinese artists who can
blend two worlds into one and
enrich his work with modern
techniques, yet remain still
essentially Oriental.’’

He also said that Ju’s techni-
que possesses tne same spirit as
the great masters of the past.

times and _ previously
unavailable on an album.
‘“‘Honky. Tonk Train Blues’’ and
“‘Barrelhouse Shake-down”’ are
the best of these, demonstrating
once again Keith Emerson’s
tremendous ability and ver-
satility on keyboards. Of the
new material, ‘‘Maple Leaf
Rag’’ and Car! Palmer’s ‘‘Close
But Not Touching’’ are stan-
douts, the latter a big band-
style number along the lines of
“Food For Your Soul’ (from
the last album).

The rest of Works, Volume 2,
though, isn’t up to ELP’s usual
high standard. Greg Lake’s
ballads don’t even approach the
beauty of ‘Lucky Man,”’ ‘‘Still
You Turn Me On,” or even
“C’est La Vie,”’ and his vocals
on some of the other tracks
(especially ‘‘Brain Salad
Surgery’) are very poor in-
deed. Furthermore, the short-
ness of the album’s 12 songs
doesn’t allow time for the
thematic and musical develop-
ment at which ELP excels—just

ainstream

 

teresting, it’s over. Works,
Volume 2 will probably be well
received by the group’s fans,
but Emerson Lake & Palmer
can do better than this.

Seconds Out
Genesis
Atlantic 2-SD9002

Genesis was recently voted
“best live act’’ by readers of the
British music publication
Melody Maker, and Seconds
Out shows why. This band in
concert is almost flawless
technically, and the rich texture
of their music loses almost
nothing in the transition from
studio to the stage. From the
opening chord of ‘‘Squonk,”’ to
the epic ‘‘Supper’s Ready,’’ to
the closing song, “Los Endos,”’
the members of Genesis
demonstrate their instrumental
virtuosity—excellent with one
exception: the drumming. Phil
Collins Genesis’ studio drum-
mer, devotes most of his time

Swimmers Win
Season Opener

Win after win after win.
That’s what the W&L swim-
mers seem to be accomplishing
the past few seasons, and
1977-78 appears as if it will
follow recent tradition. Coach
Bill Stearns’ mermen started
the new year with a 58-55 win
over James Madison in Har-
risonburg.

The Generals turned in some
superb early season times, in-
cluding three new school
records. Senior and 13 time All-
American John Hudson swam
the 1000 free in 9:46.994 break-
ing his own mark. That time
would have been good enought
to win the national champion-
ship in both Divisions II and III
last year. He also qualified for
the nationals in the 500 free.

Co-captain Keith Romich set
a new mark in the 200 fly with a
2:03.990 clocking breaking his
old mar,. The third record was
set by the 400 medley relay
team composed of sophomores
Drew Pillsbury, Scott Duff, Bob
Newcomb and freshman Will
Hodges as they swam the
distance in 3:47.79.

Other individual winners for
the Generals were Keith
Romich in the 200 free
(1:49.305), Bob Newcomb in the
50 (22.811) and 100 free (50.541),
Drew Pillsbury in the 200 in-
dividual medley (2:08.437), and
John Hudson in the 500 free
(4:50.712). W&L’s next action is
on December 3rd when they
travel east to take on the
University of Richmond.

We Win 89-88

Generals Catch H. S.
Tigers In Final Minutes

by Mark Mitchell

Senior Bob Forlenza came off
the bench last night to spark the
Washington and Lee Generals
to an 89-88 victory over the
Hampden-Sydney Tigers.

The game matched two teams
who possess powerful offenses
and porous defenses. The game
was a dramatic, although not an
artistic, masterpiece. However,
the Generals gained control of
the defensive boards at the end,
Collins plucking down karom
after karom, to insure the vic-
tory. In fact, the Generals out
rebounded the larger Tigers 42
to 40. They also outshot H.S.

52% to 49%.

The first half see-sawed back
and forth. W&L jumped off to a
13-8 lead, as the Tigers seemed
nervous. However, aided by the
General’s poor shot selection,
Hampden-Sydney took the lead
at 22-17. Larry Meyer scored on
a behind-the-back pass from
Forlenza to give the Generals a
27-26 lead. Subsequently, Meyer
hit a succession of shots,
posting his larger defender.

McHenry Departs From
Wilson Field Sidelines

by Jim Barnes

Bill McHenry, Washington
and Lee’s head football coach,
announced his resignation from
that post immediately following
W&L’s 20-18 victory over
Georgetown in the season finals
on November 19th. He will re-
main at W&L as the athletic
director and continue to chair
the Department of Health and
Physical Education.

McHenry, a 1954 graduate of

ball coaching spot.

Sports Information Department

 

University’s faculty in the fall
of 1971 as Athletic Director and
Department Chairman, and
assumed the position of Head
Football Coach in 1973. He was
an All-Star center at W&L from
1951-53, and captained the
Generals his senior season.
After being named the Univer-
sity’s Outstanding Major Sport
Athlete in 1953-54, he was
selected for both the 1953 Blue-
Gray Football Game and the
1954 College All-Star Game.
Apparently McHenry had in-
formed his assistants of his in-
tention to resign halfway
through the season, after the
Hampden-Sydney game. He did
not, however, publicly state his
resignation to his players until

after the Georgetown game.

His speech was a short state-
ment recalled by one member
of the football team as, ‘This
will be my last game.”

The timing of the statement
dimmed what was a jubilant
locker room scene, and created
a saddened group of men who
had worked since August in a
joint effort to turn the football
program around at W&L. One
player recalled how he was
“shocked and dumbfounded’
after McHenry announced his
decision. Many players were
upset over the coach’s decision
to retire from the head football
position. Another player com-
mented that McHenry was also
visably shaken over what he
was Saying.

It seems as though, in an ef-
fort to improve the football pro-
gram, McHenry is stepping
down to allow a new face and a
new look to take the helm-of
W&L’s struggling football pro-
gram. McHenry’s five year
record was 12-36-2. His 1977
team completed the season with
a 3-8 won-loss record, and a
fourth place finish in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference.
Before coming to W&L,
McHenry coached football and
served as Athletic Director at
Lebanon Valley College, and

‘also coached at Williams Col-

lege and Pennsylvania Military
College.

No successor has_ been
named. McHenry is beginning
an immediate search for a head
coach who will be responsible
for rebuilding the Washington
and Lee football program.
Several interviews have been
conducted and it seems as
though next year’s coach will

not be chosen from any of
W&L’s assistant coaches. It
also seems likely that some new
assistant coaches are going to
be brought in from the outside.
The position of current
assistants is uncertain. There is
some speculation around
Doremus that any coaches re-
tained by the next year’s head
coach will have to be approved
by him.

Several players have com-
mented that McHenry could not
have worked any harder to
make the football team a win-
ner this year. One player said
that everybody made mistakes
this season, but McHenry, as
head football coach, ultimately
must shoulder the _ conse-
quences of those mistakes.

Generals

W&L soccer coach Rolf Pira-
nian was named the ODAC’s
Soccer Coach of the Year by a
vote of the conference coaches
last Tuesday. The second year
coach, a 1974 graduate of the
University, led the Generals to
a 2-2 ODAC mark and a second
place conference finish. They
also won the championship of
the VISA Western Division II
and the Virginia Wesleyan
Tournament. Five of Piranian’s
players were selected for the
VISA All-Star game to be held
this Sunday, the most ever for a
W&L soccer team.

Two of Piranian’s players
were named to the first team
allODAC soccer team for
1977—forward Bill Stone, a

But, the Generals did not stop
Sydney’s offense so the teams
were exchanging baskets. Near
the end of the half, however,
Sydney took control of the game
and the refs to post a five-point
half-time lead.

The second half started out
with the teams trading baskets
with Hampden-Sydney getting
the better of the shoot out. Their
lead bulged to eight and then re-
mained at five. For a long time
it appeared that the Tigers
could not be stopped. Finally
they cooled off.

Forlenza, on the other hand,
did not cool off. He hit a series
of shots from downtown, allow-
ing the Generals to tie the score
at 67 all with ten minutes re-
maining. Moments later Wenke
and Leunig combined on a
beautiful give and go play to
give the Generals the lead at
71-69. But the Generals were not
able to pull away.

The Tigers roared back. They
overcame a three-point deficit
to obtain a one-point lead and
the ball with two-and-a-half
minutes remaining. The Tigers
then called a time-out and then
went into what appeared to be a
freeze. The Generals remained
cool, stayed in their 1-3-1 half-
court zone, and finally Leunig
stole the ball.

Seconds later, Bruce
Williams was_ fouled
underneath. He hit his first
shot, tying the score, but missed
his second. Ardith Collins re-

bounded it, gave it to Leunig’—

who found Williams alone
underneath. Bruce hit the shot
giving W&L an 89-87 lead. The
Generals got the ball back
leading 89-88, and went into the
four corners. With a little over
thirty seconds remaining Den-
nis attempted a difficult lay-up.
The ball went off the rim, was
fought for, appeared to hit a
Hampden-Sydney player as it
went out of bounds, but was
awarded to the Tigers.

The Tigers called time out
with 22 seconds left and again
with nine seconds left, playing

-who came

for the last shot. Actually they
got four shots, but none went in
the basket. Washington and Lee
survived the shoot out to win its
first conference game of the
year against the talented
Tigers.

The game answered many
questions the fans may have
had about the Generals. Can-
field was correct when he listed
his bench as a positive factor in
the team’s success. Coach Can-
field played ten players, and all
contributed. Jim Berlin gave
the team some needed rebounds
early in the game; Smitherman
blocked a few shots; Bruce
Williams scored the team’s last
three points; and Bobby Forlen-
za played well enough to keep
Wenke on the bench most of the
second half even though Mike
was five for seven from the
floor while dealing out eight
assists.

The team even did a credible
job on the defensive boards. Ar-
dith played a very solid center
and rebounded well
underneath, but a lot of the
credit for the Generals’ suc-
cessful defensive rebounding
belong to Dave Leunig. Leunig
guarded Bob Burrell, a forward
into the game
averaging 15 rebounds a game.
Burrell came away with five re-
bounds, partly because Leunig
kept Burrell twenty or more
feet away from the basket most
of the time. Burrell, a strong in-
side player, resembled the
ODAC’s largest (and most con-
fused) guard as he handled the
ball, not underneath the basket,
but in the corner.

The Generals showed that
they are indeed winners by
bouncing back from last Satur-
day’s ignominous defeat and by
not allowing the erratic of-
ficiating to both them.
However, better execution,
especially on defense will be
necessary for the Generals to be
winners this Saturday when
they invade Lynchburg.

the ODAC soccer champion,

Three W&L football players
were selected to the 1977 first

They were co-captains Mark
Duncan, an offensive center,

Smith, flanker Richard Wiles
and runningback Steward
Atkinson. W&L’s lone second-
team defensive selection was
linebacker Carl Folcik. Of the
eight W&L football players who

them return in 1978. Only Dun-

Football Team Closes
Season On High Note

The W&L football team com-
bined a consistent offensive per-
formance with a clutch defen-
sive showing last Saturday on
Wilson Field and proceeded to
win their final game of the 1977
season. The 20-18 win over
Georgetown University was the
team’s third win of the season
against eight defeats, and was
also W&L’s fourth straight vic-
tory over the Hoyas. The
Generals had earlier completed
their ODAC season with a 1-3
mark.

Seven seniors made their
final game one to remember led
by co-captains Jeff Slatcoff, a
potential All-American
linebacker, and offensive
center Mark Duncan. The five
remaining seniors on the 1977
squad were quarterback Ted
Hissey, tight end Bob Szczecin-
ski, split end Bill Frear,
halfback Ed Johnson and defen-
sive back Phil Bailey.

The game started out as a
battle of field goal kickers as
the Hoyas’ Ed Delgado kicked
three pointers from 43 and 44
yards, and W&L’s freshman
kicker Dave Edward booted one
from 21 yards, his first as a
General. Edward later kicked
one from 38 yards that proved to
be the winning points.

W&L led 106 at the half
behind Edward’s field goal and
PAT and Ted Hissey’s five yard
run. They went on top 17-6 with
11:00 remaining in the third
quarter when sophomore
Stewart Atkinson rambled 40
yards around right end for six
points. The Hoyas closed the
gap to five points with a 11 yard
TD pass from Bob Sitz to Jim
Boland, but the pass for two
points was followed by a hard
Generals’ pass rush.

After Edward’s second field
goal, Georgetown hit paydirt on
a two yard run by Boland with
3:28 left in the game bringing
the score to 20-18. That put the
pressure on the W&L defense to
stop the two point conversion,
which they did by sacking Sitz
as he looked in vain for an open
receiver. The W&L defense
limited Georgetown to 93 total
passing yards and 202 on the
ground, with 60 of those coming
on one run by Stiz.

W&L dominated the game
statistically with 430 yards in
total offense, 308 on the ground
and 122 through the air. The
Generals’ had the ball for 66
plays to the Hoyas’ 40 plays.
Hissey completed 9 of 14 passes

The Generals played three
halves of excellent basketball
during Thanksgiving vacation,
but during the fourth half they
looked like turkeys while get-
ting the stuffing knocked out of
them 59-38. They lost the game
against York College, 97-95
Saturday, despite going to the
locker room after the first half
with a 19 point lead.

However, the Generals did
have an excellent game against
Clinch Valley the previous
night, whipping the Cavaliers
108-81.

Spartans received 31 points to
the Generals’ 9 points from the
line.

Coach Verne Canfield com-
mented, ‘It disturbs me when
you get a hose job at home.”’
However, he said he was not go-
ing to let the team use this as an
excuse. He said the Generals
simply did not play well enough
to win. Meanwhile the Spartans
were psyched up and playing
very well, he said.

Indeed, the Spartans did
seem to be playing over their
heads in the second half, hitting
63 per cent of their field goal at-

in his final game. Atkinson had
another super afternoon with
213 yards on 34 carries in-
cluding the 40 yard TD run. The
213 yard total is only two yards
shy of the school record of 215
yards which Atkinson set
earlier in the year against
Bridgewater.

With two 200 yard plus after-
noons, the sophomore speedster
finished the season with 767
yards playing in only eight
games, the third highest single

season total in W&L history
(John Anthony, W&L ‘67, holds
the record with 915 yards.)
Atkinson now has 1270 yards in
two seasons. With a 95.9
average per game, he finished
the year as the ODAC’s second
leading rusher.

Junior flanker Richard Wiles
cuaght three Hissey passes for
47 yards against Georgetown
and now has 92 in three seasons,
tying him for fourth with Chap-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

COP-OUT

It is the present policy of the Lexington Police Department to not
fully disclose to the public and press all information relating to ar-
rest records and issued court summonses. Although we are told a
previous chief initiated the policy, Chief James Kirby is in full sup-
port and agreement with it. Thus, he has full responsibility for the
present policies and actions of his police force.

City Attorney William Roberts has attempted to provide legal
justification for the policy, but we just cannot agree with his inter-
pretation of the law. We read the purpose of Virginia’s Freedom of
Information Act as the legal mechanism for making more informa-
tion available to the public—not less. Counsel Roberts apparently
disagrees with this intent of the statute because, under present
policy, the Police Department can and is keeping secret police
records we believe should be made public under any reasonable in-
terpretation of the law.

The importance of all this is that abuses of power can infiltrate
and corrupt a system if its affairs are conducted in secret. The
reason for making records public is to make abuses of power less
likely, so that the police cannot ‘‘cover up” their own mistakes.
This is not to imply that Chief Kirby’s police department is involved
in any improprieties, violations of the law or the civil rights of in-
dividuals. But the citizens of Lexington must be protected from the
possibility that some member of the present or future Police
Department may abuse his power because of 4 confidence that he
can use the secret policies to hide impropieties.

We cannot agree with Mr. Roberts, restrictively narrow inter-
pretation of the Freedom of Information Act. Mr. Roberts asserts
that the police have the authority to refuse public disclosure of
records of arrests and summonses. He says that the police can
make some records available when they choose to do so, but are not
obliged to make the records available immediately. We disagree.
The fact that our position is supported by the Virginia Bar and the
Virginia Press Associations makes us more confident in our convic-
tion that Mr. Roberts is wrong. The recent statements by Attorney
General Troy make Mr. Roberts’ position even more untenable.

A LAMENTATION

It is a lamentable occasion when an organization loses its main
driving force. It is even more lamentable for the people the
organization serves. Rick Goddard’s resignation from the EC is
a cause for lamentation and concern. His role as the crusader for
the letter of the law and the shoes he used to trod down that dark
lonely path will be hard to fill. What should add to the public’s
frustation is most of the members of the EC are glad to see him go.

Mr. Goddard was not your run of the mill W&L student. He brust
into the ranks of the EC representatives last year in faded blue
jeans with hair falling below his collar. His views were many times
radically opposed to the opinions of the other EC members, though
he was only interpreting the letter of the law as he felt it should be
interpreted. In essence, he was willing to go out on a limb and sub-
ject himself to public criticism for what he believed, which is more
than most of our EC members have shown to be willing to do.

For a man who was worried about honor, handling of student
money, and responsibleness of committee chairman, there is little
wonder he felt his hands were tied when nearly every motion he
proposed recently was scoffed at and defeated by votes of 8-1 and
9-1. The motions, similar in nature to the one which established ac-
counting procedures for committees, were good ones and above the
comments of his peers. But it is hard to implement change in the
‘khaki culture”’ if you aren’t a member.

Though it would be in the best interests of the student body if Mr.
Goddard remained on the EC, perhaps it isn’t in his best interests.
It is easy to become discouraged; he lasted longer than most would.
So rather than blaming him for forsaking the public’s trust in him,
he should be thanked for doing as much as he did.

Thanks, Rick.

Responses to editorial outcry
E.C. member irritated at theft

The Nose, ’77

Blows

17 November 1977
Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

I have read your newspaper
with great interest since I
played out my option and had to
retire from college journalism.
I still regret not being able to
write, edit and lay out the Phi,
the University’s grand and

glorious paper, which in these |

times of woe, could use some

~ help.

It did grieve my _ heart,
however, to see some interloper
abscond with the column I
founded, nurtured through the
hard times, and at last brought
out into the full light of day asa
full-grown, somewhat prickly,
gossip column.

I am speaking, sir, of the col-
umn “The Nose Knows,” which
has degenerated from a source
of little tidbits about people in
high places to a whining, snivel-
ing,~ constantly complaining
dung-heap of drivel and petty
bellyaching.

At the beginning of this year,
when you saw fit to farm my
column out to some other
writer, I objected. You put me
in my place by informing me
that I had no copyright, no pa-

_tent, and, therefore, no right to

keep my column from such
desecration.

I hope you now rue that deci-
sion. Your bush-league , writer
has proceeded to insult just
about everyone, libeled a few of
them, cost you a big chunk of
advertising, generally made a
first-class (southern end of a
north-bound mule) of himself
and prostituted my creation.

Now, in public, before all the
world, I ask that you never let
that bum write another column
for your paper, and that if he
does and you let him, that it
does not further ruin the once-
good name of my column. In
short, sir, cease and desist.

Sincerely,

Dear Editor:

When I chose to come to W&L
last spring, I was very much
looking forward to the Honor
System. Not only the Honor
System in relation to academics
but also in other respects. The
thought of leaving a book on a
table or my room unlocked and
not being worried with trivial
theft appealed to me.

It bothered me the first cou-
ple weeks of school when a pen
on the memo board of my dorm
door had been taken. But it was
extremely irritating when a
high school jacket disappeared
from the coat hall of the Com-
mons sometime between Sun-
day dinner (11-20) and Monday
breakfast. It seems to be a high
price to pay for forgetting my
coat after dinner.

The coat was an average dark
blue mylon jacket and had the

Great Seal of the United States
with the words ‘‘United States
Capitol Page”’ surrounding it on
the left breast. If someone pick-
ed the coat up, by mistake or
otherwise, I’d appreciate its .
return to the Commons with no
questions asked.

Of course I realize I could be
unjustly ragging on the school.
The thought of a townie being
responsible has crossed my
mind several times. But I just
can’t rule out the possibility
that a student could also be
responsible. I guess I’m just
sore because the jacket meant a
good deal to me. Maybe I have
some consolation in that the
W&L pin on the collar of the
jacket was lying on the floor
below where the jacket had
been hanging.

A little irrationally,
Steve Abraham ‘81

Although police presently
have no firm leads, Chief Kirby
said that law officials in
Albemarle County reported
locating several components of
stereo equipment although no
positive identification has link-
ed that equipment to the thefts
in Lexington.

Lt. Carl Emore of the police
department said W&L students
can practically expect break-
ins over the holiday recesses.
“I’d take everything of value
with me,”’ he said.

Last year, several student
housing break-ins also occurred
-during vacation periods
although over $3,000 of that
equipment was subsequently
recovered by the police depart-
ment. “Of course it took us a
long time to get a lead,’’ Chief
Kirby added.

Last year’s break-ins were
finally traced to a group of local
juveniles who, reportedly, were
freed after their arraignment
because of their age.

This year’s break-ins, similar
to those robberies of last year,
are also suspected to be the
work of a local gang.

Ring-tum Phi, Dec. 1, 1977, Page9

Catalogue “misleading” to students

by Ken Mastrilli

After careful reading of the
Washington and Lee catalogue
and Student Handbook by
members of the staff at the Ring-
tum Phi, we've determined that a
study into whether or not many of
the student organizations includ-
ed in these publications are ac-
tually viable and effective, or
merely just resume fillers for
future job applications. In an ef-
fort to examine and scrutinize the
efficiency and viability of various
student organizations on campus,
as well as determining whether or
not they should be included in the
Washington and Lee University
catalogue, the Ring-tum Phi will
present, in coming weeks, a series
of articles in an effort to k2ep
both student officers and ad-
ministrative officials on their
toes. Hopefully this investigation
will provoke student officials, as
well as administrators to carefully
reassess their responsibilities.
Administrators in charge of
editing and revising the material
contained in the catalogue will
hopefully be more careful not to
allow misleading information like
that concerning the Independent
Union, the subject of the Phi’s
first article, to get into the
catalogue.

The Independent Union, an
organization which is supposed
to sponsor intramural athletics

and social activies according to

&L’s' student catalogue and
handbook, has been defunct for
three years.

Dean of Students, Lewis G.
John, who is responsible for
editing the particular section of
the catalogue where the error
has appeared over the past
three years, said he hadn’t
notice that this information on
the Independent Union was still
being included in the catalogue.

“Grand inquisitor”’

as a copy of any physical
evidence to be used against him
during a trial. These sugges-
tions have also been _ in-
corporated into the honor

In striving for open govern-
ment,.Goddard was instrumen-
tal in seeing that the selection of
committee co-chairmen was
kept in open session, rather
than in executive session as
some EC members desired. He
also proposed accounting
guidelines to keep co-chairmen
from abusing student funds. He,
along with George Griffin was
responsible for seeing that par-
ties become public knowledge.

Goddard was also a strong ad-
vocate for the law school. He

$3,000 more from the EC than it
received last year.

Goddard was probably the
toughest examiner on the EC.
Never afraid to ask the tough
question, he was almost em-
barassingly candid at times.

Goddard told the Phi he
thinks he has done about all he
wanted to do this year, and it’s
about time someone else came
in and took over. He said he
believes several present
members of the EC have the
capacity to take over his job as
the “grand inquisitor.’’ At this
time it looks like the two most
likely candidates are Jackie
Borden and Mike Missal, but
Goddard mentioned that he
thinks freshman Chris Gam-
mon is coming along well, too.

John agreed that this in-
formation could be misleading
to a prospective student who
might read it and assume if he
came to W&L and decided not
to join a fraternity there was
always the Independent Union
to fall back on.

Dean John promised to edit
this section or change the wor-
ding. As it stands now, the
catalogue reads as follows:
‘‘Many Washington and Lee
men do not affiliate with frater-
nities. They may participate in
the activities of the Independent
Union, which, like the frater-
nities, sponsors intramural
athletic and social activities.”’

John said he might preface
the paragraph with “if there is
enough student interest,’ or
just take it out entirely until the
IU becomes a viable organiza-
tion again.

Dean John said that much of
the information in the catalogue
is reprinted each year without

‘much scrutiny. But after these

revelations he said he would be
a little more careful.

John said that the fluctuating
existence of the IU in past years
makes it hard to know whether
or not to include it in the
catalogue.

This year’s SAB co-chairman
Charlie Hulfish said the reason
the Independent Union was in-
cluded in this year’s handbook
can be attributed to former co-
chairmen Mike Armstrong and
John Berley. It seems that they
simply reprinted the same in-
formation that was in the
previous year’s edition instead
of examining its contents for
misleading information like
that on the Independent Union.

History

According to Ed Burgess,
WLUR news director and

former vice president of the IU,
the SAB took over the social
functions of the IU. And, since
anyone can get together an in-
dependent intramural athletic
team, the IU was left with no
real function to perform when it
disbanded in 1974.

Ed Burgess was able to offer
the Phi some very interesting
reasons for the IU’s demise.
Back in 1974, according to
Burgess, a brief revival of the
IU was attempted under the
leadership of Robert
Piedrahita, who has since
graduated. Burgess said that
Piedrahita thought the IU could
be run on a total budget of $1.48
and deemed Piedrahita’s

leadership as ‘“‘totally ineffec-
tive.’’

Attempts at forming a bridge
club, chess club, and ping pong
team, along with other sports
and social activities, failed
miserably due to lack of funds
and student apathy, according
to Brugess, despite the fact that
at the time more than 35 per
cent of the student body con-
sidered themselves _in-
dependents.

Considering the fact that
most students can go to a frater-
nity party without too much
hassle. the social function of an
Independent Union was
destroyed, said Burgess, in
response to whether or not he
thought the IU could make a
comeback at W&L. “As for
athletics, the rules have been
altered so that independents
can organize a team under their
own power withoug having to
come to an independent union
for its help,”’ he said.

Burgess noted that another
big problem is trying to procure
funds or membership dues from
an apathetic student body. He
also said that the words
““independent”’ and “‘union’’ are
almost contradictory, which
may explain the problems the
IU has encountered in legitimiz-
ing itself on campus.

Most independents are in-
dependent because that’s the
way they’ve decided to spend
their four years here, he com-
mented. He said that many of
the independents were not in-
terested in joining the IU for the
same reasons that they didn’t
want to join a fraternity. They
just didn’t care to be associated
with any group, he said.
Burgess said that most of the
people he came into contact
with as IU vice president were
somewhat anti-social _ in-
dividuals to begin with; adverse
to any kind of association with
anybody. Also the fact that the
IU had no power to collect dues
from independents made it very
hard to organize and pay for
parties and mixers, which
might have helped legitimize
the IU, he said.

Since the SAB has taken over
the responsibilities of the IU, at
least in a literal sense, many
students feel that the SAB is not
servicing the 35-40 per cent of
the student population known as
independents as well as they
should be. Lee Howard, former
IU member, says that instead of

Atwood dignifies house |Notice

(continued from page 3)

The house is one of four
neoclassical residences built on
the front campus as part of the
college’s 1841-42 building pro-
gram. The Lee-Jackson
restoration was paid for
through a substantial gift from
an anonymous benefactor and a
grant from the National
Historic Landmarks Commis-
sion.

The university plans to
restore the three other pre-Civil
War front-campus faculty
residences as soon as gift funds
are available. The restorations
are part of W&L’s ongoing
development program for the
decade of the 1970s.

Although the identity of the
architect is not know, ‘The Ar-

chitecture of Historic Lex-
ington,’’ just published by the
University Press of Virginia,
says the front-campus houses
are characterized by ‘‘the quali-
ty of the design and the im-
pressive architectural composi-
tion.”

The entire front campus at
Washington and Lee, including
the Lee-Jackson and the other
houses, is a National Historic
Landmark, the highest recogni-
tion the federal government can
give a private site. At the time it
announced the designation, the
Interior Department described
W&L’s as “one of the most
dignified and beautiful college
campuses in the nation.”’

Poly-scientists to meet

Political science instructors
from around Virginia will meet
in Lexington Saturday for the
annual Conference of Virginia
Political Scientists.

Highlight of the conference,
for which both Washington and
Lee University and Virginia
Military Institute are hosts, will
be a keynote address by a
counselor to former President
Ford.

John O. Marsh Jr., a 1951,
W&L law school graduate, will

speak on “The Ford-Carter
Transition.”

Editorial reprinted with per-
mission of Hollins Columns

The first whispers about it
flowed through the dining room
grapevine and stories of its
outlandish comments were
often dismissed in minds as
gossip-down views. But when
xeroxed copies of the W&L
Ring-tum Phi editorial,
‘Season Opens’’ (or the ‘rack-
date’ editorial as it is referred
to at W&L) were posted on
campus bulletin boards and
doors, the most colorful rumors
proved to be true.

Quite a few women saw the
editorial as a joke, a satiriza-
tion of the social scene for both
women and men. That may
have been its initial intent. The
editorial is so poorly written
satirically, however, that our
advice to author ‘‘jmg’’ is to
study Benjamin Franklin or
Ring Lardner.

For the majority of the
students, though, the blatant
discount of women, regardless

of the editorial’s point, showed '

through.

Not only did the title allude to
a hunt, but the whole imagery of
the piece was such that we were
the hunted and W&L ‘‘men”’
were about to embark on this
great expedition: ‘We have
been blessed with unusual luck
this year.’’ “Good Luck! Ex-
perience is the best teacher...’’

Yet the fatal mistake the
Ring-tum Phi made was
dismissing women’s collegiate
efforts in a description of ‘‘the
girls up here’ as ‘‘the
equestrian majors, the home-ec
majors, and ‘probable’
kindergarten teachers.’’ This
stereotyping met with universal
repulsion.

In writing this we are not sug-
gesting we are able to change

the attitudes of some W&L
men. Evidently, they have been
encrusted with sadly outdated
images of female/male roles.

U.C. MEETING

will be for this year.

Pre-calc course to be considered

by Randy Smith

Whether or not the Math
Department will offer a pre-
calculus course, and the future
fate of the University Council
will be two of the topics of
debate at this afternoon’s U.C.
meeting.

Students initiated questions
about a pre-calculus course at
last month’s meeting, but
discussion was scheduled for
this month because no
representative of the
Mathematics Department was
present. It is expected that
students will question the seem-
ing reluctance of the Math
Department to institute a pre-
calculus course, even when
‘“‘many’”’ students feel the need
of one.

Also up for consideration and
debate is a motion introduced
by Professor Sessions at the
close of last month’s meeting.
The motion reads in part: ‘“‘The
University Council will meet
when (and only when) called by
both of the co-chairmen upon
the request either of the Presi-
dent of the University or of at
least six Council members...’’

Prof. Sessions said that his
reason for submitting the mo-
tion was to instigate some
“‘serious self study.’’ His resolu-
tion would ensure that there
were “important things worth
talking about, instead of trivial
issues.” He also hopes that it
would prompt advocates for
various issues, as opposed to
the current system which
seems to force individuals to
‘talk off the top of their heads.’’

Professor Goldsten has
already provided some opposi-
tion to Sessions’ proposal. He
views the University Council as

a “communications insurance
policy, a forum” which should
not be closed down for any
reason. Goldsten maintains that
there are many vital issues in-
volving the entire University
community which have yet to
be brought up. ‘‘One of the ways
not to have burning issues is to
maintain the lines if com-
munication.’’ He feels that the

py Conrad on the career receiv-
ing list (Tony Perry caught 154
passes in four years). Atkinson
also caught three passes in the
win.

After an 0-6 start this fall
complicated by numerous key
injuries, the Generals rebound-
ed to win three of their final five
ball games. When one looks
back on the season, it becomes
apparent that if two one point
losses (Centre and Emory &
Henry) would have gone W&L’s
way, and one of two games that
could have gone either way
{Randolph-Macon and _ Lock
Haven) went the Generals’
way, the team could have just
as easily been 6-5 as 3-8. A two
point conversion in the E&L
game would have given the
Generals a tie for second place
in the ODAC rather than a
fourth place finish.

The 1978 football Generals
will open the season against the
James Madison Dukes in Har-
risonburg, and return home the
following weekend to host
Davidson College. The com-
plete 1978 schedule follows: 9-9
at J. Madison, 9-16 Davidson,
9-23 at Centre, 9-30 Randolph-
Macon, 10-7 at Maryville, 10-14
Hampden-Sydney (homecom-
ing), 10-21 U. of South, 10-28 at
Bridgewater, 11-4 Emory &
Henry, and 11-11 at
Georgetown. Three of the teams
four 1978 ODAC games are at
home with only the Bridgewater
game an away contest.

Civic minded frats revealed: Uniy, Council Meeting

So what’s all the noise about

The University Council will
meet on Thursday afternoon,
December 1, 1977 at 4:30 in the
Student Executive Committee
Room of the University Center.

In addition to the routine
minutes of the faculty commit-
tees, there are two items on the
agenda for this meeting: (1) the
possible need for a pre-calculus
mathematics course, with
discussion to be held with
representatives of our Depart-
ment of Mathematics; (2) the
following motion of Professor
Sessions which has been held
over from the last meeting:

“The University Council will
meet when (and only when)
called by both of the co-
chairmen upon the request
either of the President of the

University or of at least six
Council members. Notice of
meeting shall be at least three
days in advance of the
meeting.”

Police Policy Challenged by Phi

(continued from page 1)

times the public is to be the
beneficiary of any action taken
at any level of government.”
City Council Roberts said that
his advice to Chief Kirby in sup-
port of the police secrecy on ar-
rests and summonses is under
“an exception” to the Freedom
of Information Act which he in-
terprets as permitting police
and sheriffs to arbitrarily
withhold all arrest records.
Roberts said that it is not
necessary for Chief Kriby or his
office to give specific reasons or
rationals for withholding any
records, but that they need only
cite the number of the statute.
One of the statutes cited by
Roberts is Section 2.1-342, part
of the Freedom of Information
Act. It reads in part: ‘‘All of-
ficial records shall be open to
inspection and copying by any
citizen of this State...Access to
such records shall not be denied
to any such citizen of this State,
nor to representatives of
newspapers and magazines
with circulation in this State.’’
“Official records’ are
specifically defined by Section
2.1-341(b) of the Virginia
Freedom of Information Actas:
‘* ,.All written or printed books,
papers, letters,
documents...reports or other

materials, regardless of
physical form or
characteristics, made and

received in pursuance of law by
the public officers of the State
and its counties, municipalities
and subdivisions of government
in the transaction of public
business.”’

Roberts rejected’ the
language of the Act that ‘any
exception or exemption from
applicability shall be narrowly
construed in order that no thing
which should be public way be
hidden from any person.”’

The City Attorney also re-
jected the view of Virginia At-

-torney General Anthony F.

Troy, as expressed in an ad-
dress given by him on June 3rd
of this year, that ‘“‘theofficial
records subject to public in-
spection include virtually every
type of record, report, or cor-
respondence held in the files of
governmental bodies or agen-
cies, if the record relates in any
manner to the official function
or business of the governmental
body or agency.”

Roberts called the Attorney
General’s comments ‘‘just a
speech,’’ and said that they
were not ‘an official opinion.”
He declared that, as he reads
the law, “arrest records” are
covered by the exe tions that
permit public officials to

withhold certain types of
specific records.
In particular, Roberts

specified ‘‘complaints”’ as ex-
empted from public disclosure.
Under his_ interpretation,
Roberts conceded _ that
“complaint, as definted (by
Roberts), covers most
categories’’ of records main-

tained by the police depart-
ment.

Roberts also cited Section
15.1-135.1, a statute pertaining
to the records kept by chiefs of
police, which appears to be in
conflict with the expressed writ-
ten intent of the Freedom of In-
formation Act.

It charges police chiefs with a
duty to protect and preserve all
records that they are required
to gather under law. The last
sentence of the statute reads:

“The records required to be
maintained by this section shall
be exempt from the previsions
of Chapter 21 (Section 2.1-340 to
2.1-346) of Title 2.1 of the Code of
Virginia.’’ This final provision
applies solely to the Freedom of
Information Act.

“The way I interpret the law,
the City has the authority to
withhold these records, it
doesn’t have to give a reason for
its actions except that is the
way it wants to do business,”’
Roberts said.

shooting 55.5 per cent in the first
half suddenly went cold, only
managing to hit on 40 per cent of
their shots in the second half.

York gained the lead for the
first time with six minutes to
play, 78-77. The lead then see-
sawed until Bortner put the
Spartans on top for good, 90-89,
with 1:02 remaining. He then
scored York’s last seven points
to seal the Generals’ doom.

The most outstanding per-
formance by a General was un-
doubtedly Mike Wenke’s. He
made 10 of 16 field goal at-
tempts for 21 points while set-
ting a W&L assist record with
17. Wenke, who rarely scored in
double figures in the past two
years, is being worked into the
offense this year and should
continue to score well.

Wenke shared high point man
honors with Larry Meyer, a
sophomore forward starting for .
the first time this year. Meyer
also had eight rebounds to go
along with his 21 points.

Other Generals scoring in
double figures were Pat Dennis,
with 19 and Bruce Williams,
with 14.

Ardith Collins shared top re-
bounding honors with Dave
Leunig. Unfortunately, Leunig
fouled out early in the second
half, putting most of the reboun-
ding pressure on Collins.

Canfield said he hopes the
team will use this game as a
lesson. He said many teams
which are only average teams
will be gunning for the Generals
when they find out the Generals
were ranked number 4 national-
ly in Division III. Canfield said
he thought he noticed an im-
plicit attitude during half time
which indicated that players
were more interested in how
many points they were going te
score than concerned about
winning the game. He said he
thought the players took their
opposition too lightly after
building up the 19 point half
time lead.

He said the players had
already held a team meeting to
talk over the game and make
sure a_ similar occurence
doesn’t happen again. Canfield
said he did not request the team
meeting; the players held one
on their own.

The Generals certainly did
not need a team meeting after
beating Clinch Valley, unless it
was to congratulate themselves
on how well they played. The
Generals had only a 44-37 half
time lead, but came out in the
second half to shoot 61 per cent
from the field and score 64
points. The 108 points they put
on the score board were the
most since back to back vic-
tories over Shenandoah, 112-77,
and Virginia Wesleyan, 109-77,
the past year.

Top scorer for the Generals
was Dennis, with 23. Wenke had
17 points, while shooting with 75
per cent accuracy and handing
out 13 assists.

Other Generals in double
figures were Leunig, with 14
and Collins and Williams, each
with 12. Collins also lead the
team with 11 rebounds.
