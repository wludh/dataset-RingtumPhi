Gallagher’s Fate Uncertain

EC Votes to Retain
Gallagher Tuesday

Pub Board

Fires

Editor Mon.

by Jim Barnes

Six members of the Publica-
tions Board voted to remove
Mike Gallagher as the Ring-
tum Phi editor at a meeting on
Monday. Two members sup-
ported Gallagher’s retention for
the one more Phi he was to put
out before Gray Coleman
assumes his responsibilities as
the new editor-in-chief. One
member abstained. The ballot
was cast in secret.

The two-thirds majority re-
quired to remove Gallagher as
the editor was achieved after
the Pub Board debated the issue
for over two hours in an open
meeting on the third floor of
Tucker Hall.

The motion to remove
Gallagher was presented by
Parker Potter and seconded by
Jeff Bird. Potter based his
resolution primarily on the
grounds that Gallagher had
“radically changed the format
(of the Phi) without talking to
the Pub Board.’’ Potter said
that as the publisher of the Phi,
the Pub Board should have been
informed of the contents of the
lampoon issue, because they
ultimately must assume the
responsibility for the articles in
theRing-tum Phi.

Potter also charged that
advertisers had been “‘defraud-
ed” when their ads turned up
along side lampoon stories
rather than regular stories.
Bird said that when he and Pub
Board President Ryland Owen
took the Rank-tam Poon to
those who advertised in the
issue, the advertisers claimed
with the exception of one, they
didn’t want their ads in the
Poon, and would not have
advertised in the issue had they

known beforehand of the nature -

of the lampoon issue.

Randy Smith, Phi news
editor, disputed Potter’s ac-
cusations that important stories
were sacrificed at the expense
of legitimate news stories.
Smith said that the stories that
were not included in the non-
lampoon section of the Phi were
not “‘time relevant.”’

Last year’s Calyx editor,
Chris Volk, wanted to clarify
the basis of the motion calling
for Gallagher’s. removal as
predicated solely on his fiscal
irresponsibility. The Pub Board
reimbursed all of the adver-
tisers in the lampoon issue.
With respect to the content of
the Phi, and Gallagher’s
removal, Volk said. ‘“‘You can’t
dismiss an editor for something
subjective.”

Volk claimed that Gallagher
cost the Phi about $300 in reim-

The Executive Committee
has taken the initial step toward
reversing the Publications
Board’s decision to remove J.
Michael Gallagher as editor of
the Ring-tum Phi. The Pub.
Board fired Gallagher Monday
for his “irresponsibility” in
printing the April 20 joke issue,
the Rank-tam Poon.

At a specially called meeting
Tuesday afternoon, the EC
voted 8-4 to reinstate Gallagher
as editor of the student
newspaper. The vote reflects
the two-thirds majority re-
quired of the EC before they can
overturn the Pub. Board’s
removal vote.

However, a second vote is re-
quired before Washington and
Lee’s student government can
constitutionally overrule the
Pub. Board’s decision and
reinstate Gallagher. The EC
has delayed the second vote un-

_ til next Monday night.

 

“I don’t believe in giving people
their money back until they ask
for it.”

J.M.G.

 

Jim Underhill, president of
the EC, urged the six day wait
“to give Gray Coleman (next
year’s Ring-tum Phi editor)
some experience putting out the
paper”’ and to give the students
time to react to the Executive
Committee’s action.

Parker Potter, editor of Ariel
and the Pub. Board member
who initiated the vote for
Gallagher’s removal Monday,

stated the Publications Board’s

position on the firing.

“The editor of the Ring-tum
Phi is an agent of the Publica-
tions Board’’ and is_ thus

“responsible to the Pub.
Board,’’ Potter said. He also

said that the editor has a
responsibility to his adver-
tisers, the subscribers, and the
students.

“The Rank-tam Poon was a
‘humor magazine’ not a
newspaper’’ which represented
a “major change in format,”
Potter continued. ‘‘Money was
obtained from advertisers
under the false pretense that
their ads would appear in a
newspaper,’’ he said.

He charged Gallagher with
“fiscal irresponsibility’? and
said the editor ‘‘cost the Ring-
tum Phi$300’’ with the lampoon
issue. “‘The Publications Board
can no longer accept respon-
sibility for the actions of
Michael Gallagher,” Potter
concluded.

Gallagher refuted the
charges by saying, ‘don’t
blame the $300 loss on me.” He
reminded the Board that the
decision to refund the adver-
tisers for ads placed in the
Rank-tam Poon issue had been
made by the Pub. Board last
Monday, before any advertiser
reaction had been registered.

“T don’t believe in giving peo-
ple their money back until they
ask for it,’’ Gallagher said. “‘I
didn’t slur (the advertisers’)
names or hurt their business.”
In fact, he added, ‘‘that paper
has given the advertisers more
exposure” because of all the
controversy.

Potter said the Rank-tam
Poon ‘‘was not a newspaper”
and that Gallagher had
“drastically altered the format
of the Ring-tum Phi. “It’s as if
we had charged you with the du-
ty of printing a newspaper and
you printed a roadmap,” he
said.

“My contention is that (the
April 20 issue) was a
newspaper, and the Rank-tam
Poon was a feature section of

Senator Sam Irvin

   
 
 

NUMBER 27

 

 

To Speak May 16

The Contact Committee an-
nounced yesterday the signing
of former Senator Sam J. Irvin

Jr. to appear in Lee Chapel on.

Tuesday, May 16. The an-
nouncement, made by co-
chairmen Billy Webster and
Walter Granruth, marks the
end of this year’s Contact
presentation.

Irvin is best known for his roll
in the Senate hearings dealing
with Watergate. He chaired the
Senate Judiciary Committee
and presided over the televised
Watergate hearings. He retired
from the senate in 1974 after 20
years of public service in that
body.

Irvin was born in Morgan-
town, North Carolina on
September 27, 1896. He was

educated first at The University
of North Caolina at Chapel Hill
and later at Harvard Universi-
ty, where he received his law
degreein 1922.

Irvin’s Senate activities go all
the way back to his involvement
on the Select Committee to In-
vestigate Censure Charges
Against the late Senator Joseph
McCarthy. At his retirement, he
was involved in the work of a
couple of committees, including
the Goverment Operations
Committee, of which he was
chairman, and the Judicary
Committee, of which he was the
second ranking Democrat.

The May 16 presentation by

_the former senator will begin at

8:00 in Lee Chapel.

cording to police.

The names of the students
were released to the press
shortly after the arrests. The
three students were Spencer
Jackson and Christopher Reid,
both seniors, and James
McElroy, a junior. Two other
local men, John Keller and
James Nash, are facing similar
charges in the affair.

The hearing for the case is
scheduled for May 11; all the
accused are presently free on
bond.

There has been no official
statement as yet from the W&L

and has been directed to begin
an investigation as soon as
possible.

“It is my duty to print
something the students will en-
joy, Gailagher answered. He
said the Ring-tum Phi under his
editorship has been ‘readable,
informative, and entertaining;
it has provoked discussion and
brought forth issues.”

Junior EC representative Jim
Davis asked if Gallagher felt he
owed anything to the reputation
of Washington and Lee.

‘We don't print the paper for
alumni, parents, or other out-
siders. The paper is for the
students, ’ Gallagher said

 

“None of us want to put ourselves

“This is not a question of
ethics,’ Chris Volk, a member
ol the Pub. Board, said. He con-
tended that Gallagher should
have gotten the Publications
Board's approval before prin-
ting the lampoon issue because
the Pub. Board ultimately
shared the responsibility for the
newspaper's content.

“We didn't feel the Rank-tam
Poon was of a nature that we
had to consult the.Pub. Board;
we put out something we felt
wouldn't hurt the paper,”’
Gallagher said,

He added that he felt he
should consult with the Pub.
Board before publication only
on stories that could be poten-
tially libelous or hurt adver-
lisers,

before the EC vote, Gallagher
charged the Fublications
Board’s decision to dismiss him
as editor ‘‘a reaction against
my liberal point of view.”’

He called the Rank-tam Poon
‘‘a satire’ and ‘‘a statement on
life here at Washington and
Lee. They (the Pub. Board)
jumped on this issue and blew it
out of proportion.”’

Gallagher warned the EC that
if the firing was upheld, it would
“discourage any budding jour-
nalist who aspires to be editor of
the Ring-tum Phi.”

Each Executive Committee
member was given the op-
portunity to express his views.

“I am not satisfied that the
Pub. Board had _ sufficient

reason to remove Mike
Gallagher,’ said Tom Healy,
law school representative.
“removal at this point does not
serve any purpose because
Michael would only have a few
more issues to put out,”” he con-
tinued.

Healy also said that the EC
“must insure” that future
editors are not discouraged by
the Pub. Board’s vote to remove
Gallagher, who he characteriz-
ed as ‘‘an aggressive editor.”

Jackie Boyden concurred,
calling the Pub. Board’’s deci-
sion a ‘‘drastic move’’ based on
“insufficient allegations.”’

‘Mike has done a good job
this year,’’ said sophomore
representative Steve Abraham,

although Gallagher’s failure to
tell his business manager about

the lampoon was “‘irresponsi-
ble.”

‘I'd hate to see him kicked off
because it would set a precident
where we can’t manage
ourselves and our newspaper,”’
said Andy Bodenstab,
sophomore representative.

Jim Davis was not worried
about the precident of removing
an editor, but was ‘‘concerned
with Mike Gallagher’s bad
judgement” and “‘his attitude.”

Neil Pentifallo, EC secretary
said Gallagher “overstepped
his bounds” in printing the
Rank-tam Poon. “Either the
editor uses good judgement or
he is removed; the advertisers
were in a sense defrauded,” he
said.

“The Pub. Board gave the
money back to the advertisers,
then blamed Mike,” said Doug
Perkins, senior representative.

The other senior represen-
tative, Mike Missel, said,
‘“‘What bothers me most is the
indecisiveness of the Pub.
Board; this is something that
has been brewing all year.”

“‘The Pub. Board has backed

all of Michael’s decisions this

representative. He said that the
Board had been ‘‘negligent”’ in
not educating Gallagher on his
duties as editor.

“This particular charge (of
fiscal irresponsibility) is not 100
percent founded,’’ said
freshman representative Chris
Gammon.

EC president Jim Underhill
said that the Publications
Board “‘had not presented its
case very well.”’ He noted that
the newspaper itself ‘is in some
amount of turmoil’’ (with last
week’s firing of Gray Coleman
from Gallagher’s staff).

Underhill noted the irony of
Gallagher’s situation as the
editor who crusaded for student

organization leaders being
responsible to the students, but
being charged himself with ‘‘ir-
responsibility.”

“‘T would not want to overturn
the Pub. Board’s decision, but I
would not want you to continue
as editor,” he said.

Vice-president George Griffin
reminded the committee that it
was not their position to ‘‘decide
what is good or bad jour-
nalism,”’ but to vote on the basis
of the Pub. Board’s action.

The EC motion to overturn
the Publications Board’s deci-
sion to remove Gallagher as
editor of the Ring-tum Phiwill
face its final and crucial test
next Monday evening,

Next Year’s Rush Extended

In a recent IFC meeting, it
was announced that the ad-
ministration at W&L has
agreed to a revised Rush calen-
dar for 1978, which would ex-
tend the rushing period over
five weekends.

The calendar, as outlined by
IFC Rush Chairman Chris Volk,
runs as follows: Freshmen will
arrive for orientation Wednes-
day, Sept. 6; Open House
registration will be Friday and
Saturday, Sept. 8 & 9; Open
Houses will occur the weekend
of Sept. 911; and the Rush
Dates — eight in all — will fall
on the next four Friday nights,
Sept. 15, 22, 29, and Oct. 6.
Préference cards will be due
Oct. 9.

Basically, the source of both
the problem and the change is
the first set of Rush Dates. Held
for years on the first Wednes-
day after Open House, it was
moved last year to Monday (the
night after the last Open House)

to remove distraction on aclass _

night. Now, it has again been
moved to Friday, leaving one

entire week between Open
Houses and the first Rush
Dates. The ‘‘no contact rule’
will prevail in the intervening
days — except Wednesday
night, Sept. 13, 7-12 p.m.

In other business, the IFC
continued to place no limit on
beer served during Rush. But
there is a consensus pushing to
raise the $1500 limit on bands
that has been the rule.

One final suggestion was
brought forward by Charlie
Brown of FIST, that the IFC
may very well adopt: a summer
newsletter to freshmen concer-
ning the mechanics of Rush.
“Emphasis would be on the
hard facts — benefits as well as

financial costs. It would not in-
clude pitches from the in-
dividual houses, but will be a
central, IFC-based view. It will
serve a purpose different from
the Rush book, which will be
distributed earlier — at Natural
Bridge.”’
NOTICE

Fraternity freshmen are to
eat the evening meal at their
fraternity houses on Tuesday,
May 9, in lieu of their regular
night at the house. The Senior
Banquet is being held on Tues-
day night , and NO MEALS will
be served for fraternity
members. Dinner will be served
early 5:30-6pm for NON-

Harry Chapin’s first solo
album, recorded after years of

rather unsuccessful
with his brothers in ‘The
Chapins,”” was a tremendous
success, and is still regarded as
one of his best albums.

This album features his big-
gest hit, ‘“Taxi,’’ which he
claims is about sixty percent
true. Many of Chapin’s songs
are partially true, or at least
based on truth, and blend that

singing

with the painful realization of
what became of his dreams:
‘And me, I’m flying in my taxi;
taking tips, and getting stoned ‘‘
Also on this album are a
number of FM radio favorites,
such as “Greyhound,” ‘Any
Old Kind of Day,’ and
“Dogtown.”

SHORT STORIES — Elektra

Chapin’s third album
represents a better effort than
its perdecessor; there are
nothing but vintage Chapin
songs on this one. ‘Short
Stories’”’ contains Harry’s se-
cond hit, ‘“‘Wold,” a song about
a travel-weary disco jockey try-
ing to settle again with his old
wife.

The album’s masterpiece is
“Mr. Tanner,” a deceivingly
simple song about a clothes
cleaner from Ohio who goes to
New York to try to become a
professional baritone, and fails.
In another song of note on this
album, “They Call Her Easy,”
Chapin looks into the heart of a
girl who is rather ‘‘easy,’’ and
finds that she is better than
most people. His conclusion:
‘Dream of the kind of world it
could be if we were free with
our love like Easy.”

Theatre forms stock company

of the university community.

The company, under the
leadership of director Al Gor-
don and business manager-
designer Tom Ziegler, will be
presenting a trio of plays with
an 1890’s flavor, running
through July 9. In addition to
Mary Sunshine, the company
will present productions ofRip
Van Winkle (a 19th century
dramatization of the
Washington Irving story) and
Thornton Wilder’s The Mat-
chmaker — that farce which at-
tained even greater success as
the musical Hello, Dolly on
stage and screen.

The total theatre classes are
forming the full staff for com-
pany, in its spring-term period.
If successful, the Henry Street
Playhouse may become a
regular summer activity for the
theatre. But after this year, it
would no longer be joined with
the regular total theatre cur-
riculum. ‘‘The idea this spring
was merely to build the com-
pany — construct the sets,
establish good PR with the local

hotels and merchants, and so
forth,’”’ said Dr. Gordon.

Many of the total theatre
students will continue to staff
the production in the summer.
But there are still many posi-
tions open for the summer;
company members will also
receive a basic salary of $50 a
week for the 6-week run. This
amount is based on the estimate
of a two-thirds full house of pay-
ing viewers nightly. If atten-
dance grows any higher, the ex-
tra profit will be divided among
the company. There has been no
casting at allfor Rip Van Winkle
or The Matchmaker; also Little
Mary Sunshine will have some
necessary cast replacements
for the summer presentations.

So if you’re looking for sum-
mer employment for June and
July, auditions for the summer
will be held next Sunday, Mon-
day, and Tuesday, May 7-9, at
3:30 pm. (The Sunday audition
will be held in the Troubadour
Theatre; the next two days’
auditions will be in the Boiler
Room.)

WLUR Notice

On May 4 at 11:00 p.m. WLUR
will present a special in-depth
look at new wave featuring two
of the hottest bands from Bri-
tain: The Jam and The
Stranglers. New wave is cur-
rently the most controversial
phenomenon in the music in-
dustry. New wave uses a lyrical
base of the seventies with
musical influences of the six-
ties.

The Jam is a three man outfit
patterned after the early Who,
and The Stranglers will remind
you of the Doors during their
peak period. Both bands were
recorded in their native habitat-
England.

Thirsty Ear is a syndicated
radio show which features
break-out artists in the music
industry. It is featured bi-
monthly on this station.

Tennis Team 9-10
Home Meet Sat.

by Mike Farrand

The tennis team has played
two matches since last Thurs-
day, one against the College of
William and Mary and the other
against George Mason Univer-
sity. With their 7-2 loss to W&M
and reciprocating 7-2 victory
over George Mason, the
Generals have updated thei
record to 9-10 and _ placed
themselves in a good position
for a winning season.

“We leveled off by intent
after the ODAC tournament and
now we're regaining our
momentum,”’ says recently
named ODAC Coach of the Year
Dennis Bussard. “We could
have played a little sharper
against William and Mary, but
they have the best team they’ve
had in years,’ continued the
coach. Bussard went on to say
that he felt the team would have
a good shot in the Nationals if
they continue to play this well,
despite the pressure put on the
team because of the number
one ranking. _

At William and Mary last Fri-
day the only victory points for

because they are the nation’s

happen. It all depends on who
can play well those days and
who we draw,’’ explains
Bussard about the uncertainty
of the May 17-20 tournament.
“We could get a horrendous
draw and bomb out,”’ he states.
He is optimistic however
because of the strength of at
least three or four players he is
taking, Johns, Jackson, and
Davis being the ones mention-
ed.

Generals Win One, Lose One;
Meet Rutgers Sat.

by Sandy Bishop

Paced by the offensive pro-
duction by Richard Graham
and the acrobatics of goalie
John Sullivan, the Maroons of
Roanoke held off Washington
and Lee’s stickman for a 14-11
victory yesterday on Wilson-
Field.

Roanoke spotted W&L a 1-0
lead, and then raced to a 7-1 ad-
vantage as Graham had six
assists in the scoring spree. The
Generals narrowed the verdict
to 7-4 at the half as Jeff Fritz
and Jay Sindler converted on
beautifuldodges and Rob
Eisdorfer made a good feed to
Johnny Black.

W&L swarmed on the
Maroon goal to open the third
quarter and goals by Black and
Sindler made it 7-6 with 13:38
left in the period.

But the Maroons then tallied
three straight, two by Dale
Chesser, and they then lead 10-6
with 22 minutes to play.

Individual efforts by Black
and Charley Stieff cut the gap to
10-8, but Sullivan then took
over. Replacing starter John
Neurohr to open the third-
quarter, Sullivan proved the dif-
ference in the fourth quarter as
well as in the last minute of the
third quarter.

Following W&L’s eighth goal,
the Generals got the ball back
and stormed the Roanoke goal
again. But with his best save of
the day, Sullivan cut off the
angle on Geoff Brent’s shot on
the right side of the goal, and
then threw himself across the
cage to stop Black’s follow up
from the left side.

The Generals slipped behind
12-8 before Black scooped up a
ground ball and made it 12-9
with7:53 left.

But Sullivan then rejected at-
tempts by Fritz and Sindler.
George Park’s goal with 2:14
leftmade it 13-9 and _ the
Generals were out of time.

Johnny BLack led W&L with
four goals and two assists while
Sindler had two goals.

While the Generals were
frustrated by Roanoke Wednes
day, things ended on a happier
not eon last Saturday.

Following a first have of drop-
ped passes and fast break op-

portunities that were missed,
W&L’s defense stopped the
Shoremen of Washington Col-
lege in the second half. Black’s
three second have goals led the
Generals to a 9-6 victory on
Wilson Field.

The General’s stickman
played well in the first half but
had real troubles trying to con-
vert fast breaks. ‘‘We must
have had eight fast breaks that
we didn’t convert in the first
quarter,’’said Coach Jack Em-
mer. The playing of Washington
goalie Tim Hart also stymied
the play of the Generals too, as
he had 12 saves in the first half
He later had to leave the game
because of a rib injury.

W&L held a narrow 3-2 ad-
vantage after the first quarter,
but Washington College, led by
G. P. lindsey and his antics
directed to Charlie Brown, did
all thescoring in the second
quarter and led 5-3 at half. At
this point in the game, W&L
defenseman Jim Herbert went
down but came back in the
game later on.

The Generals defense led by
Brown and Chris Walsh, put the

 

second half. Washington was
held te one goal and was unsuc-
cessful in six extra man at-
tempts. ‘On the whole, the
defense has been a tremendous
plus during the season,’ Em-
mer Said. ;

At the other end of the field,
W&L pumped six shots by Cint
Evans, who was put in a tough
spot as Harts replacement, but
did a credible job. Three of the
tallies came from Black.
Washington’s Lindsey narrow-
ed the margin to 8-6 with 6:57
left, but the Generals were not
to be overtaken.

Not only did the Generals out-
shoot the sroeman 57-41, but
W&L outscooped Washington
College on ground balls and nar-
rowly edged them in faceoffs,
10-9.

Now ranked eighth in the na-
tion, W&L faces a tough opo-
nent in the Scarlet Knights of
Rutgers on Saturday. The
Knights are ranked fifth this
week following a one goal loss to
number one Cornell. The game
Saturday is a must win for the
Generals if they entertain any
notions of post season play-off
berth.

Brown saves one against Washington College; they were harder to
come by against Roanoke.

Track Team Does Poorly In ODAC
Tournament - Meets Winner On Friday

by Bill Sherwin

Coach Norris Aldridge seem-
ed a little depressed Tuesday
morning as he discussed his
team’s performance in_ the
ODAC Track and Field cham-
pionships at Emory and Henry
College. The Generals had
finished in sixth place in a field
of seven teams. The overall
results were Bridgewater in
first win 78.5 points, Lynchburg
with 61.5, E&H with 37.5, EMC
with 36, Roanoke with 28, W&L
with 27.5, and Hampden-Sydney
bringing up the rear with 2.

‘‘We just had a bad day,”’ said
Aldridge. “For example, in
what could have been a victory
in the 440 relay’ we dropped the

baton. Little things like that
really hurt us.” Nevertheless,
Aldridge insists the team per-
formed at a fairly satisfactory
level. Bob Hoffman recorded
his best effort of the year in the
triple jump with a leap of 44’6’,
while Karl Cheatham set his
own school record of 46’2”’. Jack
Norberg finished second in both
the 100 meters and 200 meter
races.

Other standouts mentioned by
Aldridge include freshman R. J.
Scaggs, who took 4th place in
the 400 meters, while Norvell
Scott took third in the 400 meter
hurdle, and Paul Hendry took
third in the high jump. Baker

Springs took fifth place in the
pole vault, and of course,
Cheatham captured second
place in the triple jump. The
mile relay team of Scaggs, Bill

Morris, Stew Atkinson and Cap-
tain Jack Norberg finished in
second place.

The teams last meet of the
season is against Bridgewater
at 2:30 this Friday at
Bridgewater. ‘“‘Our kids are up
for it,”’ says Aldridge, ‘‘We will
need good performances from
our guys to do it, but it is possi-
ble we may beat them.’’ Last
year, Bridgewater edged W&L
in the ODAC championships,
but lost in the dual meet. It

should be an interesting con-
test.

years in the real estate and in-
vestment banking fields, in 1938
he became general manager
and vice president of WACO,

Baseball Team

Concludes Season Sat.

by Warren Drowdus

The Generals’ baseball team
came away with a split of a
doubleheader with Virginia
Military Institute on Sunday the
outcome of the two games were
in doubt until the final outs had
been recorded. Washington &
Lee won the opener, 3-2, and
dropped the nightcap in extra
innings by the same score.

The Generals pushed across
three first-inning runs in the
first game by dint of four VMI
errors and a Dan Kingman
single. Sophomore Chip Childs,
probably the most consistent
pitcher on Coach Lyles’ staff,
was able to hold the opposition
to only two runs, scattering
eight hits in the process. The
game was the nineteenth con-
secutive loss for the VMI squad.

VMI snapped the winless
skein with a cliffhanger win in
the finale. After the regulation
seven innings of play, the score
was knotted at two. VMI,
however, was able to touch
loser Vic Shepherd for a run in
the top of the eighth, W&L
didn’t die easily, though. With
one out in the bottom of the
eighth, the Generals had run-
ners on first and second with

Don Swaggert at the plate.
Swaggert hit a line shot right at
VMI pitcher Mike Davies, who
amazingly caught the ball
barehanded, and threw to first
to complete a game-ending dou-
ble play.

The split of the doubleheader
made the Generals’ log for the
season 4-14, 2-8 in the ODAC.
The team will conclude the
season on Saturday with a game
at Liberty Baptist College.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Business as usual...

It has been a time of rare actions...F or the first time in some five
years, the Publications Board voted to remove an editor before his
term of office had expired. Then, as if to top that, the EC overruled
this decision last Monday — one of their few instances of ‘‘pulling
rank”’ on the Pub Board. In the meantime, we all await the final
decision of the EC next Monday, and the staff for next year, with
very little warning, is rushed in to fill the breach. So, while we wait,
I feel it is important for the new staff and editor to express their
feelings.

Perhaps the greatest source of annoyance to me has been the in-
sistence that I or members of my staff were responsible for remov-
ing copies of the lampoon issue of April 20. It simply is not so.
Though unaware of some of the content, it is true that this writer
was a contributor that week, and in fact supported the parody con-
cept. And even though there were certain parts of that issue which
I, along with many individuals, found objectionable, I believe that,
in the end, opinions on these stories must be left up to the in-
dividuals’ own tastes.

It is not the job of the editorial staff to reclaim (or ‘‘seize,’’ if you
will) published copies, any more than it is our job to distribute
them. Personally, I am of the opinion that there is very little that
the average W&L student could have seen that would have caused
him any great loss of innocence. The Publications Board investiga-
tion seems to uncover the fact that the supposed ‘‘confiscation”’
was due to nothing more than faulty circulation at the outset, coupl-
ed with the nature of the paper, which led to its being picked up
quicker in high-traffic places like the Bookstore or Student Center.
Indeed, the sight of a person casually strolling the campus with
several hundred papers under his arm would be rather hard for
everyone on campus to miss, at noon on a school day. And the fact
that no eyewitness to the ‘“‘crime”’ has appeared in any of the inter-
minable hearings that we have had to sit through, would seem to
kill the story once and for all.

, te EH

The degree of anger shown by the students this week brings me to
another subject. I believe most will agree that no purpose at all
could have been served by mailing this issue to parental
subscribers. Their confusion would be understandable — after all,
how can you hope to understand a parody when you have little or no
experience of the original? I find it unfortunate, though, that there
was no better attempt made to circulate the paper among the
students. In fact, the students attending the various meetings this
week seemed most upset about the very fact that they had been
“protected”’ without their consultation, rather than over the
relative merits of the issue itself. As one said, ‘‘We pay for it; no
matter how good or bad it is, we havea right to receive it.”

It is very hard to believe how so much clamor ever developed
over something so trivial: the lampoon, the chreats on both sides,
the anonymous letters on the Colonnade. jt is indeed a time of
heroes, and we should all be proud.

In fairness to Mr. Gallagher, the following points are made. As
many of you know, he is the power behind the road race which gives
so much to MS — probably the greatest charitable effort by an in-
dividual in recent memory. Very few know that he took the editor-
ship at a crucial time, with the loss of the W&L Print Shop
facilities. Moreover, he succeeded in re-training an entire staff in
the unfamiliar surroundings of a new office and print shop, with a
100% larger format. Even so, the prospect of the EC jumping into
the controversy is not too soothing. It seems that something must
be lost here. Either the Publications Board loses its freedom to
make its decisions, or future editors lose the privilege to print what
they feel is just. Iam not overjoyed with the prospect.

As for our overriding sentiment here in the office, it was probably
best expressed by a disgruntled Jim Underhill, when he said, ‘This
paper has made more news than it has reported.”’ And, that is the
greatest injustice of all — the spectacle of the paper itself, forced
from the reporting of regular news stories to the necessary
coverage of this ‘‘canned controversy.”

Business as usual — the book should be closed, one way or the
other. Regardless of the decision to be made by the EC next week,
one would hope that the various parties would have the good grace
to let a dead dog lie.

LETTERS TO EDITOR
Students protest “parody”’

Dear Editor, Students, and
the Exexutive Committee,

The recent turmoil within the
Publications Board andRing-
tum Phi staff is an unfortunate
issue to be thrown at the
students, EC, and the ad-
ministration. The Pub Board
decided to remove Michael
Gallagher from the editor’s
chair because of fiscal irrespon-
sibility. The EC voted
marginally to overturn this
decision, as is within their
power.

In the EC meeting on Mon-
day, several issues pointing to
the support of the charges were
brought out. The Pub Board
sees four areas of responsibility
for the editor: (1) Responsibili-
ty to the students of printing a
student newspaper which, in
form, is a NEWSpaper, (2)
Responsibility to the adver-
tisers to print their ads per
previous agreements ontracts,
(3) Responsibility to the Pub
Board as the ultimate publisher
of the paper to print the news in
a manner set by their direction,
and to check out any large
movements from the norm with
them in advance, and (4)

 

   
   
     
       
   
   
   
   
   
   

Co-op employee
bids farewell

Dear Students, Faculty, Staff
and Alumni:

I want to say thank you for the
23 years of service that I work-
ed at W&L in the University
Supply Store. I have made
many friends and truly miss
seeing all the students and the
alumni that come from time to
time. My health has failed,
therefore I wasn’t able to return
to work in September.

Ican truly say, I don’t think
a person could have been
treated any nicer by the
students than I was.

I feel that I would like to see
each in person to say thanks for
helping to make my life such an
enjoyable one but since that is
impossible I’ll say ‘‘remember-
ing you all fondly.”

Always,

Kelcey Clemmer Chittum
Fairfield, Va. 24435
Box 64

Responsibility to their
subscribers to deliver campus
news in the form of a student
newspaper.

Mike Gallagher was charged
and found guilty of violating
thses last three principles, and
deservedly so. He did not
deliver the form of newspaper
his advertisers had agreed to be
placed in, he did not consult the
Pub Board on the tremendous
change in format, and he did not
deliver a student newspaper to
his subscribers - as a result of
indulging in personal whims,
the administration revoked the
Phi’s mailing privilege.

To us, as students, he must
answer to the fourth charge as
well. Although he has been well
represented in all his hearings
by loud and_ distracting
students, there are still many
students who feel they were
denied what they consider to be
a student newspaper and who
feel that their money having
been spent to publish theRank-
tam Poon was a clear abuse of
the editor’s responsibility. We
are of this latter group.

After the evidence presented
by the Pub Board at the EC

hearing, we feel that the
Board’s decision must be
upheld. Gallagher did not con-
sult his advertisers informing
them that their ads would ap-
pear ina lampoon issue - and
several of them were reported
as shocked and disgusted at
having their ads appear in the
issue. Can clear irresponsibility
to one’s sponsors be covered up
with the line that as long as
some students liked it, it was
just?

He also neglected to tell the
Pub Board of any of these ac-
tions before the fact. In short,
his total ignorance of his
responsibilities to inform those
concerned in the financing of
theRing-tum Phi clearly shows
us that the Pub Board decision
should be upheld. The fact that
Mr. Gallagher has refused to
acknowledge any irresponsibili-
ty shows us further that he
should not be in any position
which requires responsibility to
the W&L community.

We hope our Executive Com-
mittee will reflect these opi-
nions next Monday night.

Applause for the
Executive Committee

Dear Editor,

I would like to commend the
Executive Committee on its re-
cent decision to “Free Mike
Gallagher.’’ However, the
nature of my statement is not
exactly what some have in
mind. The EC did the only thing
possible on account of the inept
manner in which Mr. Gallagher
was removed by the Publica-
tions Board.

What else could the EC do,
but override the decision of the
Pub Board? It doesn’t make
sense or seem really fair that
the Pub Board should drop a
bomb in Gallagher’s lap after
backing him on so many of his
previous bloopers, blunders,
and errors. It is the Pub Board
that is primarily responsible for
Gallagher’s lack of taste. They
have never done anything in the
nast when Gallagher: stuck his

foot in his mouth.

I was offended by that parody
issue. It may have been
humorous, but it is not my idea
(nor that of a great many
others) of how I want my school
represented. But that is a moot
point. The real issue at hand is
the dangerous precedent that
will arise by not putting
Gallagher in his place. A person
who is awarded the position of
editor of a school newspaper
should have some modicum of
integrity and good taste. It is
true that the Pub Board was
quite slow in trying to
ameliorate the situation. But
they tried. They were generous
in the past in backing
Gallagher’s past blunders, but
this was the straw that broke
the camel’s back.

bursed advertisement fees.
Gallagher pointed out that it
was the Pub Board’s decision to
reimburse the advertisers. Volk
said that the Pub Board had no
other recourse given the fact
that the advertisers didn’t know
in advance of the lampoon
issue.

Dave McLean _ ex-business
editor of the Phi, said, ‘‘I don’t
think that these issues warrant
his dismissal. We don’t want to
send a message to the com-
munity that we are opposed to
creativity. Let’s look at the im-
plications. The motion is sym-
bolic, long range.”

Peter Goss, this year’s
business manager, agreed with
McLean that the issue was sym-
bolic, but differed with him on
the subject that it didn’t war-
rant Gallagher’s dismissal.
Goss said ‘‘I think it’s an impor-
tant issue, whether the editor is
going to be responsible to the
Pub Board.”

Grant Leister Calyx business
manager, also questioned the
motion severity. In response to
accusations that he acted ir-
responsibly; Gallagher said
relatively little that he has not
already expressed. Gallagher
and Caylx editor Temp Webber
said that the students had sup-
ported Gallagher’s position at
the last Pub Board meeting.

They said the fact that
Gallagher’s tenure was still be-
ing discussed, after the motion
was withdrawn at the last
meeting, was indicative of the
Pub Board’s desire to circum-
vent the will of the student
body. Both Potter and Bird
disputed that contention claim-
ing that 125 people does not con-
stitute the will of the entire stu-
dent body.

Bird and Potter added that

just because the motion to
remove Gallagher as the editor
of the Ring-tum Phi had been
withdrawn at the last meeting
did not mean that the issue was
over.
An official Pub Board letter
appeared in the glass-encased
bulletin board next to the
library notifying the student
body of the time and place of
Monday’s Pub Board meeting.
The letter indicated that the
issue of Gallagher’s tenure had
not been concluded.

Speaking for the “missing
papers’”’ the investigating com-
mittee, Bird said that he could
not find any evidence that the
administration had _par-
ticipated in rounding up of left
over Phi’s, with the exception of
Bob Keefe’s response to the
complaints he received from
visitors to the campus. Keefe
approved Mike Cappeto’s
removal of undistributed copies
(50-70) in the Student Center.

Bird suggested that the copies
eventually were distributed to
the students, although not
through the normal procedure.
According to Bird, the circula-
tion staff of the Phi did not
carry out their respective
duties for various reasons.

Jay Hemby had to attend a
lecture being given by Dean

Rusk at VMI. Ned McDonald
had personal misgivings about
distributing the Rank-tam
Poon. Chris O’Conner saw some
copies in Evans Dining Hall,
normally part of his route, and
assumed that somebody had
already carried out his circula-
tion duties.

However Bird suggested that
‘the shock value brought extra
demand for the papers.’’ He
also said that it is very common
for fraternity members to take
25 or so copies back with them
to their house. Since Wendy’s
was advertising free coupons
this week, Bird said it’s likely
that people picked up extra
copies for the coupons.

Bird also said that Betty
Munger on Friday morning took
200 copies of the lampoon issue
over to the Bookstore and plac-
ed them next to her cash
register. According to Bird,
Munger said that the copies
went unusually fast.

Webber said that much of
Bird’s reasoning was no less
speculative than his theory that
someone gathered up 700 issues
of the paper.

After being informed of the
verdict both Gallagher and
Webber stormed out of the
meeting room.

Neither remained for the
discussion concerning next
year’s business manager of the
Phi. Owen reported that no ap-
plications for the position had
been received. Peter Goss said
that he would be willing to re-
main as business manager for
next year. The remaining
members of the board
unanimously approved Goss’s
reappointment to that post.

A Chapin Discography — Concert, May 11

(continued from page 3)
Chapin reveals that he never
had time to be with his son while
he was young and then finds,
when his son grows older, the
young man no longer has any
time to be with his father. The
second hit from this album, “I
Wanna Learn a Love Song,” is
about his giving guitar lessons
to a bored and_ love-lost
housewife.

Also emerging from this
album was ‘30,000 Pounds of
Bananas,’’ which was to
become a concert favorite. This
humorous country tune, which
also became a favorite on the
Dr. Dimento Show, provides the
audience with a good break and
release of emotion amidst the
melodrama of a Chapin con-
cert.

PORTRAIT GALLERY —
Elektra 7E-1041

The mood of ‘‘Portrait
Gallery”’ is a little lighter than
most of his other albums, but
this mood is shattered on the se-
cond to last song, ‘““Bummer,”’ a
ten-minute saga of a young man
from the ghetto, whose only
escape was to die.

The album’s light tone is set,
however, with songs like
‘“‘Dreams Go By’’ and ‘‘Tangled
Up Puppet,” a song in which he
addresses his daughter with a
message similar to the one con-
veyed to his son in “‘Cat’s in the
Cradle.”

are contained on this one. The
live album captures the true
magic and magnificence of a
Chapin concert, and gives a
pretty good indication of what
to expect next Thursday.
Brothers Tom Chapin (guitar,
banjo, and vocals) and Steve
Chapin (piano, vocals, and pro-
ducer) rejoined Harry for this
tour, and the live versions of
almost all the songs are better
than the studio versions. One of
the most remarkable features
of this album, like the concerts,
is the backup vocals of bassit
John Wallace. Wallace has an
incredible eight-octave voice,
ranging from the angelic highs
of ‘‘Taxi’’ to the deep baritone
of ‘‘Mr. Tanner.” Another wor-
thy of notice on this album is a
ten-minute, joke-filled version
of ‘30,000 Pounds of Bananas.”

ON THE ROAD TO KINGDOM
COME — Elektra 7E-1082

Chapin followed his live
album with a rather weak
release, and I thought his
career might be on the
downslide after six fine albums.

“The Mayor of Can-
dor Lied,” a song about a young
man who falls in love with the
mayor’s daughter, only to find
that she is his half-sister, has
received a lot of FM airplay.

DANCE BAND ON THE
TITANIC — Elektra 9E-301
Chapin must have realized
that “‘On the Road to Kingdom
Come”’ represented a poor ef-
fort. A lot more work went into
the recording of ‘‘Dance Band

as ‘‘Bluesman,” a song about a
