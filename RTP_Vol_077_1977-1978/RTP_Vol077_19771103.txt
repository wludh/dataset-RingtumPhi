ontact, SAB In Trouble

EC Calls SAB
To Testify

by Lee Howard

If the co-chairmen and the
treasurer of the Student Ac-
tivities Board have not com-
plied with Executive Commit-
tee requirements for strict ac-
counting guidelines and the pro-
curement of night deposit bags,
the EC will ‘‘have to go into ex-
ecutive session’’ because that
would be an “automatic honor
violation,” said Rick Goddard
at Monday’s EC meeting.

A motion submitted by God-
dard, senior law _ represen-
tative, asking co-chairman
Charlie Hulfish and Bill Tucker
as well as treasurer Jim

Town -

Cars
Towed

by Tom Salley

This past Saturday, Parents’
Weekend, at least five cars
were towed by the Lexington
Police Department from spaces
adjacent to school property.
The owner of each car was fined
$5 for parking in a restricted
zone, in this case beside Gilliam
Dormitory on Washington
Street, and charged an addi-
tional $12 as a towing fee.

Chief James Kirby of the Lex-
ington Police Department said
that at the time the cars were
towed there were 22 of 30 park-
ing spaces open in the front gym
parking lot. He said that his
department had been in the
practice of placing safety cones
in the restricted areas but had
discontinued this method
because too many cones were
being stolen. Street signs and
painted curbs now indicate the
restricted parking areas along
Washington Street.

The Development Office of
Washington and Lee, in con-
junction with the University’s
Proctor’s Office, had informed
the Police Department last
week that this past weekend
would be busy; crowded with
visiting parents.

They denied, however, that
there is any sort of verbal
agreement between the school
and the police department
about overlooking parking
violations on big weekends, and
they were not surprised to hear

_ af the towings, ,

Foreman to appear before the
EC to show they have followed
the guidelines passed
unanimously, 11-0. Jack Bovay,
junior EC representative and
ad hoc member of the SAB said
he believes that, as of Monday
night, the SAB had not been
keeping receipts and had not ar-
ranged for night deposit bags.
However, all EC members
contacted refused to consider
making lack of adherence to the
guidelines the basis for an
honor violation. When the EC
passed its guidelines at its first
meeting in September, Goddard

VP Says Contact “Deceptive”

by Jim Barnes and Lee Howard

Ten to 12 Contact members
were treated to at least a $115
dinner with Bruce Jenner and
his wife last Spring, Contact co-
chairmen Billy Webster and
Walter Granruth have confirm-
ed.

Also, approximately $500 was
held over from last year’s
budget and passed on to this
year’s administration, Webster
said, contrary to a two year old
Executive Committee order
specifically directing that all
unused Contact funds be return-
ed to the Central Student Body

Gown Relations
Mayor Talks Noise

In an effort to get at the story
behind the news, the Ring-tum
Phi interviewed the two highest
ranking officials of Lexington’s
city government. The mayor, Dr.
Charles F. Phillips Jr., is

ultimately responsible for all city

policy. The city manager, Mr.
John V. Dane, is the appointed
official responsible for the actual
day-to-day operation of the city's
administration and services. Both
were interviewed by Ring-tum
Phi staff reporter Randy Smith.

In conversations last seek
with Lexington’s mayor Dr.
Charles F. Phillips, and city
manager John V..Doane, the
Ring-tum Phi discovered that
relations between Washington
and Lee students and the Lex-
ington townspeople are
‘‘generally good,’’ at least in the
minds of those two influential
city administrators.

Mayor Phillips said that he
‘‘refused to believe’’ that rela-
tions between the town and the
students were not good because
of earlier problems this year
concerning the city’s noise or-
dinance. ‘‘I don’t think relations
are even really strained,’’ Dr.
Phillips replied to further in-
quiry. (Sigma Phi Epsilon and
Phi Gamma Delta fraternities
were fined $10 each in court ac-
tions resulting from violation of
Lexington city ordinance 15-32,
Section B, which pertains to ex-
cessive noise heard after 11
p.m.; both violations occurred
during W&L’s Homecoming
Weekend. )

City manager, John Doane,
believes that the relations bet-
ween the town and the students
has been ‘‘somewhat strained—
and that is unfortunate,’’ but he
does not see ‘‘any long run

Fund at the end of each
academic year, according to
EC President Jim Underhill.

Although Webster stated that
the dinner could have cost up to
$130, our sources of information
claim the dinner only cost $115.
Granruth, who would neither
confirm or deny the cost of the
dinner, asked, ‘‘What is your
source for this information?”
However, he acknowledged the
dinner did take place. Last
year’s co-chairman John Bruch
said the dinners may have in-
cluded Contact members’
dates.

Granruth said that the $500
figure was “‘inflated,”’ but he
refused to release the specific
sum that remained in the Con-
tact account during the sum-
mer. According to section IX of
the Student Body Constitution,
subsection B, point 5, ‘‘All other
net profits from organizations
participating in the Student Ac-
tivity Fee shall revert to the
Central Student Body Fund.”’ So
any amount of money held over
in the Contact account would be
a violation of the constitution.

Underhill, when informed

about the dinner said ‘I think
that’s something we should ap-
prove. What we give them
money for is to bring speakers
to the campus, not to have par-
ties with them.’’ Our sources in-
dicate the dinner was held at
the College Inn. Webster
defended the dinner by saying it
was held in lieu of a party which
he believes Contact members
deserved.

Both Underhill and EC vice
president George Griffin said
that the $500 was not reported
as potential revenues when Con-
tact submitted this year’s
budget. Griffin said the EC took
money away from Ariel and
gave it to Contact without being
informed that Contact had the
extra $500. “If they knew they
had the money and they didn’t
include it in revenues, then they
were being deceptive,” Griffin
said.

Granruth said that the $500
which was held over was
necessary for the operation of
Contact over the summer and in
the fall before Contact received
any funds from the EC, the In-

Dalton Wins
Mock Election

The Republican candidates
for governor, lieutenant gover-
nor and attorney general made
a clean sweep of a Mock Elec-
tion sponsored by the Ring-tum
Phi on Monday.

Republican gubernatorial
candidate John H. Dalton had
the largest margin of victory,
beating Democrat Henry
Howell with 61 per cent of the
vote, 114 to 74. However,
Howell’s 39 per cent of the vote
was better than he has fared at
mock elections in most other
Virginia schools, particularly
James Madison University
where he received less than 30
per cent.

Dalton fared slightly worse
among persons residing in
Virginia, winning 59 per cent of
the vote to Howell’s 41 per cent.
However, among Washington
and Lee students residing in
Virginia, Dalton won by a 2-1
ratio. Dalton had 46 votes to
Howell’s 23 from_ in-state
students.

The faculty, however gave 10
of its 12 votes to Howell, or 83
per cent. Despite the fact
Democratic lieutenant guber-
natorial candidate Charles
Robb lost, the faculty gave him

90.9 per cent of its vote, com-
pared to Republican Joe
Canada’s 9.1 per cent. However,
the faculty did favor
Republican attorney general
candidate Marshall Coleman by
a 6-5 margin over Democratic
challenger Ed Lane.

Overall, Canada edged out
Robb 85 votes to 79, or 51 per
cent to 49 per cent. Also, Col-
eman beat Lane 81-67, 55 per
cent to 45 per cent.

An interesting sidelight is
that, of the Dalton supporters,
55 per cent were fraternity
members, while Howell sup-
porters were predominantly in-
dependents’ Almost 57 per cent
of Howell voters were in-
dependents, only 43 per cent
were fraternity members. It
was hypothesized that the
reason for this is that fraternity
members tend to be richer than
independents, and it is a known
fact that Republicans tend to be
richer than the average person.

Lee Howard, news editor of
the Phi and organizer of the
Mock Election called the tur-
nout of 190 ‘great. We usually
don’t have that many people
vote in student elections, which
are much more important.”’

The Student Control Commit-
tee will not allow marijuana
smoking in the dorms this year.

So far this year the Student
Control Committee (SCC) has
heard only one case involving
pot smoking in the dorms. The
individual accused was found
guilty and assessed a penalty of
social probation for a period of
two weeks. According to SCC
chairman Jim MeNider, if
smoking becomes prevalent in
the dorms, penalties will
become more severe aS a
deterent.

MeNider said that this year’s
SCC will decide on its own
policies. He added that this
year’s SCC does not feel con-
strained by the minimum penal-
ty for pot smoking implemented
by last year’s SCC. Last year
the SCC established a minimum
penalty of a $50 fine, two weeks
social probation, and a letter
home to the offender’s parents
for smoking pot in the dorms.
MeNider said that it was possi-
ble that this year’s SCC could
establish an even more severe
minimum penalty if smoking
cases before the SCC become
more frequent.

MeNider added that this does
not mean that the SCC will be
handing out more severe
penalties in its next pot case.
However, he added that the SCC
was not going to let pot smoking
become a problem. He said the
SCC wants to eliminate pot
smoking in the dorms entirely
and that the SCC is not going to
let an occasional incident go by
with a mere slap on the wrist.
McNider made it clear that it
was up to the SCC to decide
what constituted occasional
violations of the smoking rule.

McNider states that when the
SCC receives a report from a
dorm conselor about a student
smoking pot, he undertakes an
initial investigation, gathering
information surrounding the
violation. If the facts indicate a
violation, the student is notified
when to appear before the Com-
mittee. Meanwhile McNider

 

SCC policies
on pot smoking

assembles the information sur-
rounding the violation into
coherent form to be presented
to the committee as a whole.
When the student appears
before the SCC, the SCC will in-
itially determine whether or not
to consider the complaint. If the
SCC votes to consider the case,
it will ‘‘undertake sufficient in-
vestigation to make a finding on
the complaint.’’ When the SCC
decides on a penalty, the stu-
dent is notified as soon as possi-
ble about the SCC’s decision.

If a student feels the penalty
assessed was too severe, he
may appeal the committee’s
penalty to the Student Affairs
Committee (SAC). This com-
mittee, made up of faculty and
students, can not reverse a guil-
ty finding of the SCC, it can
merely soften penalties handed
out by the SCC. The SAC must
receive appeals in written form
within 48 hours of the SCC’s
decision. The SAC will also hear
a case if three or more
members of the SCC feel the
SCC’s penalty was to harsh or
too lenient.

Penalties the SCC can assess
vary from monetary fines and
reprimands to a suggestion of
suspension from the university.
Such a suggestion for suspen-
sion must be approved by the
SAC. The maximum monetary
fine the SCC can levee is $50, not
including any damages the stu-
dent may have caused during
his misconduct. The most wide-
ly used penalties are social pro-
bation, where students are
restricted from participating in
university social events, and
dormitory probation, where
students are prohibited from
entering dorms from 8 a.m. un-
til midnight.

McNider emphasized that
marijuana cases makes up only
a small fraction of the total
cases the board hears. The ma-
jority of the cases the commit-
tee decides on involve other
types of student misconduct, in-
cluding mischief down the road.

ter Fraternity Council, or
parents. He listed the rental of a
post office box, phone bills and
other incidentals as justifica-
tion for having this reserve
fund.

Underhill and Griffin both
said that this procedure was
wrong. Underhill said that Con-
tact should have paid bills out of
their own pockets and kept
receipts for these expenses and
brought them to the EC for
reimbursement at the beginn-
ing of the academic year. Grif-
fin said that all other organiza-
tions are in the same position
that Contact is in at the beginn-
ing of the fall term, and he sees

rapped

no reason why Contact should
be the only organization to have
a reserve fund.

Underhill, when informed of
Contact’s ‘$500 fund,” and the
Jenner dinner, said that this
year’s, and perhaps some of
last year’s, co-chairmen would
be requested to appear before
the EC Monday night to explain
their handling of Contact’s
finances. Underhill said, ‘“We’ll
have to look at this in the same
light that we are looking into the
SAB.” He also said that the EC
may subtract from Contact’s
current budget a sum equal to
ihe amount of money kept in the
reserve fund over the summer.

Touring group presents

Journey Into Blackness”

Voices, Inc., America’s only
year round coast to coast
theater, will come to Lee
Chapel next Wednesday at 8
o’clock. The acting troupe,

devoted to educa-
tional/musical theater, will
present ‘‘Journey into

Blackness.”’ This play, like the
“Time Tunnel’ takes the
viewer on a fourth dimensional
voyage throughout the two hun-
dred year history of the black
man in America. The actors
and actresses present the
“from slavery to the future”’
itinerary through a fast-paced
combination of group and solo
singing, choreographed move-
ment, and brief dramatic se-
quences. ‘‘Journey into
Darkness,’ designed to in-

crease the general awareness of
the black man’s plight in the US
and black goals and aspira-
tions, has a cast of eight singers
and two musicians.

Voices, Inc.’s rich twenty-five
plus year history includes many
honors and achievements, in-
cluding a selection performed
for President Lyndon B.
Johnson’s birthday party and a
high compliment from the
teacher’s college at Columbia
University, “It provides ways
and means for teachers to make
classroom learning more rele-
vant to the lives of the students
they teach.” The show will com-
mence at eight o’clock in the
evening of November 8. All
students are urged to attend.

‘Most white students are ig-
norant to what black students
are all about,’’ declared Ardith
Collins, secretary for the Stu-
dent Association for Black Uni-
ty, (better known as SABU
around the W&L campus) For
this reason, explained Collins,
SABU serves not only to in-
crease the degree of black
awareness among black
students but within the white
community as well.

Otherwise, SABU serves as a
social outlet for all but two of
the blacks at Washington and
Lee. SABU’s social calendar
climaxes with the wintertime
Black Ball. Invitations are ex-
tended to all members of the ad-
ministration, the blacks at
W&L, and president Huntley.
The music is varied between
jazz and disco.

Collins pointed out that SABU
also pushes, and will continue to
do so, for more extensive
recruitment, along the lines of
affirmative action, of black
students. Collins, skeptical
about the utility of using black-
oriented majors as an incentive
to expand the presently small
segment of Negroes at W&L (of
1.5% of the student body), said,
“I don’t think many people
would major in Black Studies.”’
Collins elaborated by saying he
would enjoy the opportunity to
take some courses in black
studies. The SABU secretary
admitted, in part, that, as bad
as the racial imbalance may be,
the situation may be impossible
to ameliorate owing to the
“backward’’ nature of the
school.

Collins stated that SABU, in
conjunction with other
organizations, may try to inten-
sify black awareness around
Lexington by hosting or co-
hosting black speakers. Collins
felt that the prospects of im-
plementing this program were
tenuous, at best, owing to the
fact that SABU is a non-due
paying organization and
desired speakers such as Bar-
bara Jordan, would require
honorarium fees.

large storage rack were pur-
chased with a $1,000 grant from

IFC Weekend To Feature
Shirelles and Rhondels

by G. T. Woodsmell and R. P.
Burnbreath

Interfraternity Council (IFC)
Weekend will featureThe
Shirelles and Bill Deal and The
Rhondels Friday night, and on
Sunday afternoon, Freddy
Goodhart’s Second Hand Band,
both at the Pavillion.

Fifty kegs of beer will be
taped at 8:30 Friday night, and
the bands are scheduled to
begin about nine, playing until
one. Saturday has been left
open and up to the individual
fraternity houses to celebrate
according to their own tastes.
The Executive Committee has
teamed up with the IFC to pro-
vide ‘‘at least’’ ten kegs of suds
Sunday, along with bluegrass
tunes; weather permitting, the
affair will be outside.

IFC Social Chairman, John
Gordon, described The Shirelles

as “an early 60’s band that
plays late 50’s music.” .The
Shirelles consist of three female
vocalists with a backup band.
Their biggest hit single was
“Solider Boy,’’ which sold three
million copies 15 years ago.

Gordon described Bill Deal
and The Rhondels as “a
nightclub performance band
playing assorted music with a
good light show.”” He emphasiz-
ed that the bands are com-
plimentary in style, but appeal
toa wide variety of taste.

Funds financining IFC
Weekend originated from three
sources: fraternity fines levied
for rush infractions; freshmen
rush registration fees; and each
fraternity’s IFC dues. The two
bands playing Friday night cost
a total of $2,750; beer expenses
will amount to $1,475. the foam

will be featured in 24 oz. paper
vessels.

Sunday afternoon’s bluegrass
bonus was arranged through
Executive Committee urging,

and will be jointly sponsored by
the IFC and the EC. Freddy
Goodhart’s Second Hand Band
will perform . Sunday from 2-4.
The event will be open to the en-

tire student body free of charge.

The weekend was described
by the IFC social chairman as

“‘a function of deferred rush”

for freshmen who have not yet

joined fraternities. Gordon add-
ed that Friday night’s event
would be one of the few remain-
ing opportunities for unpledged
freshmen to see fraternities ‘‘as
they really are.” The charge of
non-fraternity members to gain
admission Friday night will be
$3 per couple. Tickets will not
be sold at the gate.

“‘As of now, we haven’t been
able to correct the problem
because of its irregular oc-
curences,’”’ said Tinsley, who
graduated from W&L in 1975.
‘“‘We will try to wait until the
Thanksgiving break before we
try to repair it. If we tried to fix
it now, the station would have to
go off the air.’’ He added that
difficulties always seem to co-
rect themselves without help
from him and there is no need to
find a solution immediately.

Tinsley went on to say that he
was not aware that students had
discovered any problems with
the station and because the pro-
blems are relatively minor, he
sees no reason to fix it now.
“Actually, last Thursday night
was the first time I had any dif-
ficulty picking up the radio sta-
tion. I was listening to my
stereo and for a brief time,

reception was poor. Eventually,
the problem corrected itself.’’

Station manager Michael
Lavitt agreed with Tinsley that
the problem was a minor one
and that it would be better to
wait until Thanksgiving break
to repair it. “If we were to
repair it now, we would have to
get off the air for two or three
days,” he said. “If it gets any
worse, we will get off the air
and try to repair it but in the
meantime, we will stay on and
continue to serve the public.”

Tinsley refused to discuss the
situation any more because ac-
cording to him, ninty-nine out of
100 students wouldn’t unders-
tand anyway. This is a very
minor problem that we can
solve by ourselves.’’ He added
that he wished the Ring-tum Phi
staff would spend more time
looking into relevant matters
and not harrass the radio sta-
tion about trivial events.

Law students vote
to restrict undergrad
use of Law Library

by Jim Ingham

A new policy dealing with
undergraduate use of the law
library has been given an af-
firmative vote by law students.
This policy forbids
undergraduate use of the
library within two weeks of law
exams and places out-of-bounds
the upper level and carrels to
undergrads. The new policy
took place immediately after it

had won in a run-off Monday .

against a more restrictive
policy.

The new policy, formerly pro-
posal B, requires that all
undergrads act appropriately in

Washing Machines Coming Soon?

by Kevin Dwyer

Four new washers and four
dryers for the Graham-Lee
Laundry Room may be in the of-
fing in the very near future, ac-
cording to eshman class Presi-
dent Dutch Waldbauer.
Waldbauer spoke with Jerry
Darrel, manager of the Cockpit,
Dining Hall and the Co-op as
well as the laundry service.

Darrel wants assurances that
new machines would stay in
good shape, and that all equip-
ment, both old and new would

be secure from use by those not
of the university community.
One possible plan would in-
clude locking the room from
midnight to 8 a.m. and having
keys available from freshman
class officers. This plan is ten-
tative and subject to approval
from the university department
of Buildings and Grounds.
Some who use the facilities
seem to throw their trash (i.e.,
lint and empty laundry soap
boxes, etc.) on the floor, despite
the fact that there is easy ac-
cessibility to trash cans in the

is essential” in getting new
machines, according to
Waldbauer. He recently clean-
ed the room, and placed signs
warning of damage to the
machines if they are overload-
ed.

Many items of unclaimed
clothing clutter the tables in the
laundry room. These items will
be turned over to Lexington
charities if not removed by Fri-
day, November 17, says
Waldbauer.

When the new machines are
installed, there will be eight of
each, and this should provide
enough open machines so as to
avoid the overcrowding that has
occurred in the past. Waldbauer
has two suggestions for those
who use the machines. 1. Wash
more often. Washing often
means small loads which will
not damage the machines, and
therefore efficiency will be at
its peak. 2. Wash in the off
hours, such as late at night
because fewer will be waiting to
use the machines.

the law library without disturb-
ing anyone. Law students and
those engaged in legal research
still have primary use of the
facilities. The proposal also
states that all private carrels
are out, and that undergrad use
is restricted to the few lounges
and empty carrels in the
library.

Proposal B won in the second
referendum after a three-way
split developed in the first
referendum. 75 voted for B in
the first go round, while 71
voted for the more restrictive A
and 26 for no policy at all. Since
a majority was required, there
was a run-off between Plan A
and Plan B. Plan B won 89-70.

Student Bar Association
President Ray Leven said the
referenda should ‘‘Tell people
where we stand.’’ He said that
after some complaints were
voiced, the SBA came up with a
plan that is more restrictive
than the final draft. Policy B
was devised as an alternative to
the older Policy A by the
presidents of the three law
classes. After open meetings
and much debate, Plan B was
voted in, Leven said

Leven said that the law
students wanted cooperation
from the undergrads and their
guarentee that they would not
take advantage of their op-
portunities. Leven also said that
there really isn’t ‘‘a lot of study
room.’’ The main reading room
is for research only, and most of
the carrels are by nature
private.

Leven also wanted to point
out that the whole decision pro-
cess was ‘‘no underhanded
deal.”’ He stressed that all par-
ties interested had a say in the
final decision, and that it was
derived in a fair and legitimate

‘way.

THE NOSE KNOWS

Two revealing stories from
Monday’s EC meeting:

The SAB will not give old
Pumpkinhead an SAB card to
get into all the SAB events
because they say he doesn’t do
enough work. Ah, _ those
curators of W&L tricks and
treats! They’re the type of peo-
ple who would go around
smashing Jack o’ Lanterns on
Halloween. Come to think of it,
the EC meeting was only a day
after the goblins came out. But
are there some skeletons in the
closet? Stay tuned next week
when you may hear the awful

‘*Rose Garden”

The

by Seth Oserin

This week the Lyric will be
showing “I Never Promised
You a Rose Garden,”’ starring
Kathleen Quinlan and Bibi
Andersson. It is about a young
girl (Quinlan) who cannot cope
with life, and thus produces a
fantasy world of her own into
which she escapes, and in which
she suffers.

The setting of a mental
hospital brings about thoughts
of ‘‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest,”’ and, naturally, thoughts
of comparisons. Well, if you
were wondering, ‘‘Rose
Garden’’ has superior written
all over it. Next to
this, ‘‘Cuckoo’s Nest” is nothing

howl of everyone getting the
axe.

The SAB wants to can two of
its members for now showing
up to meetings. You can’t find a
sinecure anywhere nowadays.
Not even with those happy-go-
lucky members of the Students
Activities Board. Of course, by
the end of Monday’s EC
meeting there may be no one
left except the members who
don’t show up. Let’s hope not.
We need people who can get
quality performers like Archie
Bell and the Drips to come to
W&L.

Land of

more than sacharrin, and Jack
Nicholson’s performance is
vanilla pudding. However, in all
fairness, it must be mentioned
that “Rose Garden” is a
realist’s presentation with a
realist’s main character, while

‘‘Cuckoo’s Nest’’ centers
around a_eromanticist’s
character.

There are only two problems
with the production. The first is
the over-exposed film that
director Anthony Page uses to
depict the patient’s hallucina-
tions. While this was a clever
deviation from the usual blur-
out-blur-in, the effect eventual-
ly proved to be annoying. This,
however could be intentional.

ENTERTAINMENT

Citizen Kane:
Welles to be screened

by M. Gray Coleman
Entertainment Editor
Next Tuesday, November 8,
the journalism department is
bringing to Reid Hall 203 the
one film that a constant majori-
ty of cinema critics and affi-
cionados seem able to call ‘‘the
greatest’ with a clear cons-
cience. That film is Citizen
Kane; in the opinion of many it
is quite simply the greatest
movie ever made.

The guiding genius of Kane
was, of course, its director and
star, Orson Welles. Still seen oc-
casionally on television talk-
shows and specials, Welles was
the ‘‘wonder boy”’ of the enter-
tainment industry in the late
1930’s. He and his Mercury
Players ~— Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead, and others
— literally shook the country
with their radio broadcast of
The War of the Worlds, and
their popularity was assured.

The genesis of Citizen Kane
was simple. RKO studio was in
great danger of bankruptcy at
that time, and Welles was
brought to Hollywood to come
up with a “miracle.” He came
on the guarantee of total
freedom—the ability to try new
techniques in cinematography
(like those odd camera angles)
and, even more, a controversial
story. Wells, in Kane, plays out
the life of the famous ‘‘yellow
journalist’? and would-be
political leader, William Ran-
dolph Hearst. All of these fac-
tors combined gave RKO their
miracle, though certainly not a
financial one.

Hearst couldn’t stop the
film’s release, try as he might.
But he could (and did) make
things so hot all over the coun-
try that hardly any movie house
booked Kane. By the time this
died down, the picture had got-
ten so much bad PR that au-
diences avoided it—and the
result was, at first, relative
failure, until the fifties and

SOOO OOOD

Oz

with the effect used to relay to
the viewer the irritation, sterili-
ty and furiousness of the girl’s
life.

The other problem is Bibi
Andersson, who plays the young
girl’s psychiatrist. Whether it is
the director’s or the actress’
fault, the psychiatrist comes
across too blase and easy-going.
Nothing seems to bother her.
This doesn’t work with the cons-
tant strain she is supposed to be
under.

Most all of the rest of the ac-
ting is excellent, but, un-
doubtedly, the main highlight of
the movie is the performance of

(continued on page 12)

 

overwhelming success with a
new audience.

Citizen Kane is Welles,
masterpiece—his first film at
an early age, made in 1940-41.
But why? Above all, Welles
had, in the Mercury Players, a
group he could depend upon as a
novice director. And secondly,
his exuberance brought dozens
of people to his door in
Hollywood—people who had
wanted to try new ideas. The
combination was stellar.

But, as modern critic Pauline
Kael says: “‘It is difficult to ex-
plain what makes any great
work great...maybe more so
withCitizen Kane than with
other great movies, because it
isn’t a work of special depth or a
work of subtle beauty. It is a
shallow work, a_ shallow
masterpiece. Like most of the
films of the sound era that are
called masterpieces, Citizen
Kane has reached its audience
gradually over the years rather
than at the time of release. Yet,
unlike the others, it is conceived
an acted as entertainment in a
popular style...to pretend that
it’s profound is to miss what
makes it such an American

 

an actor’s and a director’s film
—above all, a ‘‘popular”’
masterpiece. The key to this
film is to appreciate it for its in-
novative quality, but enjoy if for
its gut appeal, too. Favorite
scenes: that great death scene
with the glass paperweight; the
political rally in Kane’s bid for
President — Wells loved
‘“‘srandstand” scenes like this;
the ‘‘breakfast room’’ scenes,
covering a period of 9 years and
the gradual deterioration of
Kane’s first marriage in a few
seconds; and, above all, the
scenes at Xanadu, and Kane’s
second wife with her jigsaw
puzzle—which serves as_ the
central metaphor of the film.
The memorable scenes, one-
liners, jokes and_ effective
camera angles form a tremen-
dous list, Anyone who has seen
Citizen Kane has their own
favorites. But, suffice it to say
that this is a rich film — im-
mensely entertaining, while at
the same time a casebook study
on the ‘“‘nuts and bolts”’ of film-
making. It’s only in Reid Hall
for one night—next Tuesday at 7
& 9 p.m’ Don,t miss it—anyone
who has seen Citizen Kane

triumph —
So this is Citizen Kane —botn

before will agree on that point.

Eye and Ear:
from the Bookstore

It’s unusual that, in what will
probably go down in history as
the great age of rock and roll,
very few people today are ac-
tually listening to rock and roll.
Today we have instead “‘heavy
metal,”’ disco, folk-country
rock, and, as always, jazz. Not
that there is anything wrong
with these types of music, oh no.
It’s just that there is also a need
for honest rock and roll which is
found in increasingly rarer
sources.

For today’s true rock and roll
fans there are very few choices.
You can listen to early (or prac-
tically any) Beatles, or you can
listen to two new, somewhat
linked albums. For those of you
who haven’t heard, the Animals
have gotten back together and
made one of the nicest rock and
roll albums I’ve heard in years.
It’s a sound that, upon listening,
will cause one to remark,
‘Wow, nobody does stuff like
this anymore!”’ But of course
you,li be wrong; almost nobody

does this kind of stuff anymore.

The album’s arrangements
are tight, Eric Burdon’s vocals
are superb, and Allan Price and
the rest of the band are right on
the money. If you like rock and
roll, check out the Animals:
Before We Were So Rudely In-
terrupted. Far and away the
best re-union LP I’ve ever
heard.

Which brings us to Allan
Price. In addition to being an
ex-, now reclaimed, Animal;
singer, songwriter, pianist
Price has had a fairly suc-
cessful solo career, the high
point of which was the sound-
track LP for the Lindsay Ander-

son film ‘‘O Lucky Man.” If you
haven’t seen this, find it
somewhere and see it. Then buy
the record. However, Price has
just released a new LP for
United Artists entitled Allan
Price.This is a collection of 11
nice songs, with good ar-
rangements, in the rock and roll
tradition, and makes a perfect
companion to the Animal’s new
release. Both LP’s highly
recommended.

This week in Mainstream,
you,ll find reviews of albums by
two relatively unknowns—one
by an undiscovered solo artist
and the other a debut release by
an oddly-named band which
contains a lot of well-known
musicians.

in Your Pit—

by Galen Trussell

Last weekend the Cockpit
featured, basically, two
bluegrass bands. The crowds
were relatively tame, possibly
due to some parental in-
fluences. Friday night’s crowd
was treated to the musical
magnificence of ‘‘Rooster and
Friends.” The band was com-
posed of four individuals play-
ing guitar, banjo, mandolin,
and stand-up bass. Their
repitoire included several old
bluegrass favorites, and an-ex-
cellent rendition of ‘Orange
Blossom Special.”’

Saturday night featured a
return performance by the one
and only “Ace Weams and the
Fat Meat Boys.” The ‘Buffalo
Creek Stompers” made a
special guest appearance,
dazzling the crowd of VMI’s
with their fabulous footwork.
Unfortunately, the crowd con-
sisted primarily of our be-
uniformed friends. As a matter
of fact, if you dropped into the
Pit around 8 Saturday night
with your parents you probably
couldn’t get a seat. They must
have opened up the gates over
youder around 7:45.

Wednesday night featured
George Fagan. Due to the Phi’s
Tuesday deadline this article
can’t describe his act. The same
thing happened to me last week
in dealing with the Buffalo Chip
Band’s_ performance, which
was, by the way, one of the best
performances I’ve seen in the
Pit.

Coming up: By deadline time
this weekend was up in the air
as far as entertainment in the
Pit goes. Dan Scott told me he
might be able to get Freddy
Goodhart and the Second Hand
Band to play in the Cockpit Fri-
day night. Hopefully the Pit will
be able to provide an alter-
native, Friday night, for those
of you not interested in the
preppie-soul-madness out at the
pavillion. Saturday is really lost
in the ozone, but their is a slim
chance the Chips might be
back.

In The Works: Last week I
reported there was a chance the
UCC might be able to procure
Dave Von Ronk for a per-
formance in the Pit. Well, Dave
is in California. Instead, Spirit-
wood, a coffee house group
which plays here last year are
almost assuredly going to play
the weekend of November 16, 17
and 18.

“Hit and Run” — Monday’s
20th-century music in Lee Chapel

by Robert Tremblay

I must be honest and admit
that I have not .been the most
vocal supporter of modern
serious music. After listening to
the Performers’ committee for
Twentieth Century Music and
their concert Continuum at Lee
Chapel Tuesday night however
I must admit that there is
“something”’ to be said for this
type of music. The committee
proved this quite effectively
with Joel Sachs, pianist, con-
ductor and co-director; Cheryl
Seltzer, pianist, co-director and

founder; Sheila Schonbrun,
soprano; Thomas Hill,
clarinetist; and Nadine Asin,

flutist, all giving superb per-
formances in a_ concert
highlighted by great variety
and interest.

We have all been stereotyped
by our past listening experience
forever expecting to hear a
melody we can hum or a theme
we can remember. As most pre-
sent experienced Tuesday, this
expectation is not always fulfill-
ed (editor’s note: regretably! ).
If it is possible for us to open up
and discard a few of these pre-
judicial chains, this music can
be enjoyed, even if you do not
hear a tune in it or cannot

2seene

distinguish a diminished fourth
from a perfect fifth.

The Bartok piece, Allegro
Barbaro, is a masterpiece and
Ms. Seltzer’s performance cap-
tured the driving, bass-
dominated force behind it. Bar-
tok’s repitition of so many
passages should make this
piece accessible, but what is
startling is the different set-
tings in which he constantly
places these passages.

Sachs’ and Seltzer’s per-
formance of the Modern
Temper, a dance for piano four
hands by Seymour Shifrin,
made great technical demands
on the soloists. The same was
ture of the Wright Duo for Flute
and Clarinet where Hill and
Asin execute in superb fashion
the intricasies of this composi-
tion.

Following these lines, let’s
look more closely at
Movements for soprano, flute,
clarinet, and piano by Jane
Wilkinson. I’m sure this piece
received the most audience at-
tention as they thought it
hysterically funny. I could not
restrain chuckles myself. The
audience may not have liked
Movements, but they certainly
were, not bored with it. It kept

Soe 28) 6.43: ¢8 6 38 6S 8

attention as you waited for
Schonbrun to do something
even more unexpected than
before (editor’s note: actually,
when she climbed into the piano
to bellow, I figured I’d heard it
all...). Very little of the Twen-
tieth Century music repertoire
can be “expected” as you ex-
pect a Mozart melody. This
aspect of continually fresh, new
sounds was conveyed convinc-
ingly by the Performers’ Com-
mittee’s interpretation of Wilin-
son’s composition.

You may not have liked all
this music, but this music made
an impression. If it had not you
would not have laughted, you
would not have had opinions,
you would not have shown in-
terest. Credit for these impres-
sions goes a great deal to the
Performers’ Committee, who
were spectacular in conveying
the possbilities and variety of
Twentieth Century music in
their concert Continuum. I still
prefer Beethoven but more per-
formances like this one might
make me, and possibly many
others, appreciate just a little
more the music of our own
lifetimes.

Ring-tum Phi, Nov. 3, 1977, Page 5

Musical Mainstream

one to describe. Musically, it
sounds very much like
something Alan Parsons might
have done, right down to the use
of a voice vocoder (a favorite
Parsons production trick) on a
track or two. Thematically, the
LP often resembles, more than
anything else, a futuristic ver-
sion of the Beatles’ “Sergeant
Pepper’? album—the _In-
tergalactic Touring Band goes
around the universe playing
their music and keeping the
cosmos happy.

The result of all this would
seem, at first glance, to be a
very confusing record indeed.
With musicians as good as those
found on this LP, however, In-
tergalactic Touring Band could
hardly miss. Featured are Rod
Argent (of the group Argent),
Dave Cousins (the Strawbs),
Annie Haslam (Renaissance),
and even Pepe Marchello of the
Long Island-based Good Rats,
to name just a few. The in-

strumental work on the album
(particularly the orchestral ar-
rangements) is very good, and
the vocals, with some of the best
singers in the business, are ex-
cellent. The lyrics, unfortunate-
ly, range from mediocre to
downright silly — the ‘‘space”’
theme wears a little thin after a
while. If you can listen to the
album and ignore the words,
though, you’ll probably enjoyIn-

Record Season

For W&L Harriers

by Clem Carter

With 10 wins Washington and
Lee’s Cross Country team mat-
ched a school record for most
wins in one season. This ties the
record set in 1914. Washington
and Lee’s Cross Country team
finished its regular season in a
quadanglar meet against
Madison, Eastern Mennonite
College and Handen-Sydney
College in Lexington last Satur-
day. The Generals placed third
raising their record to ten wins
and five loses.

Eastern Mennonite won. the
meet with 26 points. Madison
was second with 31 points.
Washington and Lee was third
with 70 points followed by
Hamden-Sydney with 115
points.

On a fast track Richard
Ferguson of Madison set a new
course record of 25 minutes and
five seconds to capture first
place overall. The top
Washington and Lee runner was
Allen Weeks who finished ninth

place overall. His time was 27
minutes and 12 seconds. Bob
Bates ran the course in 27
minutes and 27 seconds to place
second for the Generals,
finishing 12th overall. Richard
Bird came in two seconds after
Bates taking 13th place. Chris
Daniels, who placed 16th
overall, was the fourth General
with a time of 27 minutes and 49
seconds. Hans Furuland round-
ed out the General top five with
a 20th place finish. Furuland’s
time was 28 minutes 59 seconds’
Kevin Grimm and Bill Welch
finished sixth and seventh for
the Generals respectively.
Grimm and Welch placed 21st
and 23rd overall. Brian Adams,
one of Washington and Lee’s top
seven men, was forced to drop
out of the race because of an
ankle sprain.

Despite the score the
Generals ran their best meet of
the year. All of the Generals,
top seven men improved their

Generals Sting Wasps
On Parent’s Weekend

by Pete Abitante

What team in the Old Domi-
nion State has won two straight,
run up a total offense last week
of over 550 yards, and had a run-
ningback break a single game
rushing record that stood for 25
years? The Generals, that’s
who!

Paced by an offense which led
eight major game statistical
categories and a defense that
allowed a stingy 51 yards
rushing, the Generals _per-
formance was dominating to
say the least as they took the
sting out of the Wasps of
Bridgewater College 33-13,
before an enthusiastic Parents’
Weekend crowd.

Stewart Atkinson led the
charge as he had the kind of day
runningbacks dream _ about.
With 215 yards on 26 carries,
Atkinson not only notched his
second consecutive 100 yard
plus performance, but eclipsed
the W&L single game rushing
record that stood seemingly
forgotten since 1952. Randy
Broyles ran for 205 yards on Oc-
tober 4, 1952 in a 33-28 loss to
George Washington.

Atkinson iced the game away
for the Generals as he scored
three touchdowns within the
first 18 minutes of the first
quarter. With barely three
minutes gone in the first period
Stu took a hand-off from Ted
Hissey and galloped 82 yards on
a beautiful run, which inciden-
tally was the second longest run

Soccer Team Fac.

by Eddie Fishin

If there is a Divine Being,
may he take an interest in W&L
soccer. If the Generals do not
receive divine help, they better
get their rears in gear, or pull
themselves up from their boot
straps, or get their heads
together, or whatever they need
to do to beat better teams.
Perhaps the level of competi-
tion is too far over the heads of
members of a class III school,
but I don,t think so.

The coaching is excellent and
the skills of the players are
good. What might be lacking is
the motivation of the players.
But collegiate athletes are sup-
pose to have an abundant desire
to win. What might help the soc-
cer team is a larger audience.
Knowing that more than two
dozen fans take an interest in
the team will help them. So,
what is demanded from all of
those who read this paper is
more attendance at the games.
Everyone buy a W&L pennant
and watch the very important
playoff game against UVa on
Monday at 3 p.m.

The team can play against its
opponents. For stretches during
a game the Generals will
outplay the other team. What
they have to be able to do is play
their best consistently and
throughout an entire game.

The team has lost three
games in the past week, exten-
ding its losing streak to seven
games in a row. The recent

loses have been to the Naval
Academy, UVa, and Madison
University. The midshipmen
sunk the Generals 4-1, them
damn Wahoos beat W&L 4 to
zip, and Mad U beat the
Generals 3-1.

In the Navy game, played in
mud and rain on the 26th of Oc-
tober, the Generals put out until
the third goal by Navy. Then
they gave up and Navy scored a
fourth.

The game was 1 to 1 at the
half, in what looked like a game
the Generals might pull out.
They were working well con-
trolling their attack against
Navy and benefiting from lucky
breaks on defense. Kevin
Carney, who played goal, was
doing a fine job. On one shot
when Carney was a few feet out
from the net, the ball was com-
ing down and it looked like it
would pass over Carney’s head
and bounce in. Carney,
however, was able to jump and
catch the ball. But he started to
fall on his back and lost the ball.
Before any harm could come
Carney knocked the ball away
from the net.

The first goal by Navy came
from a cross on the left side.
Carney at the corner of the net
jumped over a Navy player and
punched the ball down. But he
knocked it in the wrong direc-
tion. The ball landed in front of
the net where a Navy player
crashed in to pump it home.

Howie Collier scored on a

penalty kick for the Generals.
Collier received a pass at mid-
field from Dana Samuelson.
Collier spectacularly dribbled
by three men and reached the
penalty area, where he was
tripped. This set up the penalty
kick.

In the second half Navy
scored three times. The first

Wingate passed 18 yards to tight
end Ken Rohle for a touchdown
as the teams headed to the
locker room.

. Wingate accounted for the
Wasps’ second and last score of
the day in the closing moments
of the third quarter as he hit
flanker Art Andrey with
another touchdown pass. But by
that time the outcome had long
been decided.

Overall, the Generals looked
outstanding. The offense ran off
a season high 87 plays and if the
ground game is any indication
of who controls a football game,
the Generals had 59 rushing
plays compared to just 27 for
the Wasps. Also impressive in
this contest was the play of se-
cond stringers, especially
freshmen Jim Herbert and Carl
Bates. The defense, on the other
hand exhibited a swarming pur-
suit style which was very effec-

tive.

As the Generals prepare for
this weeks contest against
Emory and Herny, they have to
be confident and maybe even a
little bit cocky. But above all,
they will have to be prepared
for an E&H team that is better
than their 1-7 record indicates.
They rank highly in all ODAC
Statistics and are second in total
offense, first in passing, and se-
cond in total defense. They are
coming off a 38-20 loss to
Hampden-Sydney but with a
win the Generals can end their
conference season at 2-2. So
let’s hope for three in a row!

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Funds mismanaged, misused

It seems as if the people who head and serve on the
various committees and organizations around cam-
pus have no conception of what it means to use and
have access to other people’s money. The SAB, and
now Contact, have shown a gross disregard for the
procedure and policy laid down by the E.C. concern-
ing the use of student funds.

According to Jack Bovay, E.C. ad hoc member to
the SAB, the SAB has failed to keep track of its money
receipts and expenditures according to guidelines
laid down by the EC. after the Hulfish controversy at
the beginning of the year. This is not to say that the
SAB is misusing student funds, but it does lead to the
question: Are the funds being abused?

Contact’s case is another story altogether. Here it
seems a definite misuse of student money has taken
place, along with a little deceit. No organization
should throw.a party for its members, using student
-money, unless approved by the E.C. beforehand. Con-
tact had a party last year for its members with the
Bruce Jenners. Not only was this party unauthorized
by the E.C., but the cost of the party was in excess of
$100.

Contact had $500 remaining from last year. This
money should have been turned over to the E.C. and
deposited in the student reserve fund. The members
of Contact instead chose to hold the money over for
this year without telling the E.C. of their plans. When
presenting their budget request this year, Contact

again failed to inform the E.C. of these excess funds,

and even went so far as to request and plead for more
student money since the E.C. gave them less money
than requested. As a result of their pleadings, $450
was taken from Ariel, the student literary magazine,
and given to Contact. It now seems that this little
deceit by Contact may jeopardize Parker Potter’s
chances of putting out a second quality edition.

These types of actions must be brought to a halt. It
is time that students are made aware that they are
answerable to an authority on campus for deceitful
and dishonorable actions. The E.C. should either
recommend to Student Control that the offending
students should be fined, or go in and clean house and
appoint new committees. This, of course, is con-
tingent upon proven guilt. If it is proven that gross of-
fenses have been made against the student body, the
E.C. must do something drastic to stop these misuses
of funds. Unless they do, “‘honor’’ may well become a
term inapplicable to this campus community.

j.m.g.
Town-Gown Proposal

Conflicts arise when two diverse groups do not have
the proper forum in which to air their grievances. At
best, rumors will be the outgrowth of such noncom-
munication; at worst, resentment and hostility will
result. The rumor is already widespread among the
students of this university that the Lexington police
are ‘‘out to get the students.”

Some sort of regular meeting must be initiated
quickly to air the differences in viewpoint between the
townspeople and the students, and to explain city
policy. Such a meeting would greatly aid in heading
off an escalation of adverse sentiment and possibly
confrontation. The city is accountable for its policy,
but the students must be given the chance to voice
their feelings directly to city administrators. The
mayor and city manager have already privately ex-
pressed their approval of such a conference. But it is
up to the students to initiate such a proposal. The
Ring-tum Phi hopes that concerned members of the
student body will act upon this proposal for a city-
student forum, and, in doing so, turn around the
already troubled town-gown relationship.

LETTERS TO EDITOR

Responses to editorial outcry

The Nose Always Knows!

Dear Sir:

I wish to clear my name from
the category of obnoxious prep
which one of your innominate
reporters seemed to think ap-
propriate. The Nose Knows not,
I’m afraid. Though his ap-
proach is original and adds a
personal flair to the paper, it is
insensate in making the Phi a
dependable, first-class publica-
tion. Also, its untimely ap-
pearance before Parents’
Weekend falls about as short of
my expectations of a quality
paper as the cartoon picturing a
student bonging. Obviously the
Nose does not cultivate a very
astute social awareness.

Firstly, I am no longer an ac-
tive X member. Secondly, I own
not one pair of bright pants,
pink or otherwise. Admittedly, I
have a green sweater, but wear
it with strict attention to color
coordination. My preference in

clothes reflects rather classic _

cuts and colors—whites, greys,
blues and yes, that green
sweater.

Thirdly, I am from a conser-
vative northern town which
seems to deny the classification
mentioned in a previous Phi ar-
ticle. By now, I’m sure you're
placing me in the pseudo-prep
category. Wrong. again!
Because I’m from the north and
attended a public school does
not deny my taste in dress. I
have always dressed in the
timeless tradition of sweaters,
khakis, tweeds, button-downs,
need I continue?

Thank you for your time, and
best of luck repairing the
deviated septum.

Dear Editor-in-Chief of the
RtP:
and To the Nose:

We will oblige your incessant
attention to our most humble
fraternity and afford you an ap-
propriate response.

Thank you so much for your |

wonderful constructive
criticism over the past few
weeks. In response we have
purchased double-knit leisure-
wear, color-coordinated with
the colors of -the fraternity,
asbestos suits for all of our
pledges, sent the Charleston
brothers up north where they
belong, required Mr. Alabama
and Mr. Arkansas to go to
reform school, appointed Lee of
A.D. as ‘‘king’’ of our house,
and initiated 17 yankees into the
bonds of our illustrious fraterni-
ty.

We realize that you are
perfect, and therefore have
divine vision with which to
judge the characters of
everyone on campus. We also
concede our despicable
behavior in all aspects of social
and campus life. But, oh mighty
Nose, we repent. Please forgive
us our trespasses. We entreat
your guidance for the re-
mainder of the year that we
may not err from the path of
righteousness which you first
troud. We will continue eagerly
to await your weekly lofty in-

 

spiration.
Just remember, everything’s
in fun, you goose!

Dear W&L community :

Phillips and Doane talk

(continued from page 1)

detrimental friction’? between
the two groups. “The majority
of students and permanent
residents of the town are not an-
tagonistic toward each other,”
he said.

The Problem of Excessive

Fraternity Noise

In extensive conversations
with both men, a picture began
to form of the present and pro-
jected future relations between
the students of this university
and the townspeople—a picture
very different from the one now
visualized by many W&L
students.

“Let’s face it,” Dr. Phillips.
said frankly, ‘‘the whole in-
dustry of this community is two
universities.’’ Mr. Doane also
agreed that VMI and W&L are
‘intregal parts” of the city,
both economically and socially.
He went on to say that the two
colleges ‘‘influence the
character of Lexington as a
community. The students must
realize that as members of the
community, they have to act
responsibly.

The current problems with
excessive fraternity noise ap-
parently began last spring with
what seemed to be a greater
frequency of parties. The
townspeople could accept
weekend partying, but weekday
festivities compounded the
potential problems. This year’s

shortened, intensified fraterni-
ty rush brought in 25 formal
complaints to the police depart-
ment, and numerous informal
complaints to city council
members and university ad-
ministrators.

Police responded to the com-
plaints as they had in the past:
by simply asking the fraternity
officer in charge to turn down
the music. But this year, it
seems, a request was not
enough. Mr. Doane feels that
the police department had lost
some of its credibility or
respect, because not long after
the requests for less noise were

made, the volume would in-

crease again to its previous
level. ‘“‘The warnings became
something that were laughed
off,’”’ he remarked.
Townspeople criticized the ci-
ty government for not respon-
ding to their needs by their
reluctance to enforce the noise
ordinance. To many members
of the Lexington community,
there seemed to have been a
“‘quantum jump in the volume
and the frequency of the par-
ties.” The police action taken
Homecoming Weekend to en-
force the noise ordinance on the
SPE and Fiji houses were a
response, then, to community
desires; they were an effort to
make the fraternities more
mindful of the townspeople’s

feelings.

Mayor Phillips emphasized
that the police action was not
harrassment. ‘‘Nobody is out to
get anybody. The police don’t
like to go into the fraternity
houses.” But the excessive
noise of the seemingly ‘‘daily”’
fraternity parties necessitated
action of some kind.

City manager Doane noted
that fraternity excesses seemed
to have “toned down con-
siderably” in the past two or
three weeks. The number of
complaints the police have
received in that time had ‘‘sub-
sided dramatically.’’ In fact,
Doane could not think of any
complaints, offhand. He hinted
that the continued good
behavior of the fraternities
might result in a lower priority
given to police enforcement of
the noise ordinance, if com-
munity concern over the issue
also diminished.

“The people in town aren’t
mad or resentful of the college
students,’’ Dr. Phillips
repeated. “‘We know there,s go-
ing to be noise,’ but the
students have to respect the
rights of the townspeople as
members of the same.com-
munity. “In nine years of city
government, I’ve never known
any problem that can’t or hasn’t
been solved.”

Musical Mainstream

(continued from page 5)

some time. His music is a direct
descendant of that played by
the troubadors of days gone
by—stories put to music. Says
de Burgh: “A song must be
good enough so that you can
play it on stage with a single in-
strument, like the minstrels of
old.”

At the End of a Perfect DAy,
Chris de Burgh’s third release
to date, contains ten simple,
moving songs of the sort one has
come to expect of the singer.
The upbeat numbers work best
here, particularly “Summer
Rain,”’ but most of the quieter,
more emotional songs are ex-
cellent as well. “If You Love
Her, Let Her Go” and ‘Perfect
Day” are exceptional, and rank
as two of the best songs Chris de
Burgh has done to date. Melody

Maker has called de Burgh ‘“‘the
most talented undiscovered solo
artists in Britain,” and it’s easy
to see why. With more music of
this high caliber, Chris de
Burgh won’t remain un-
discovered much longer.

Closing Notes: Pete Town-
send is currently writing
material for a new Who
album...A new Genesis album,
entitledSeconds Out, is due for
release any day now. The LP is
a double live set recorded in
Paris in 1976 and 1977. Mean-
while, Steve Hackett has left the
band in what he calls an
“amicable” split. Genesis will
apparently continue as a three
piece band...Emerson Lake &
Palmer’s latest,Works Volume
2, should also be in the stores
soon. The'single LP contains no
less than 12 tracks — seven new

group and solo pieces, and five
previously released single sides
until now unavailable on an
album...And speaking of ELP,
WLUR-FM will present ‘90
Minutes with Emerson Lake &
Palmer’’ on Thursday,
November 10, at 10:30 p.m. The
show will feature an interview
with the members of the band
and, of course, lots of their
music...Jackson Browne, too,
has an album coming out short-
ly, a live set called Running on
Empty.....And finally, the
Beach Boys seem to be holding
together after their near-
breakup, reported in the last
column. Car] Wilson insists that
“everything’s fine.”

Infirmary always
open

by Mark Danos

It is not uncommon to travel
to the infirmary and find there
is no doctor present even though
the infirmary is open 24 hours a
day. ;

There are three doctors serv-
ing the student body. They are
doctors Frederick A. Fed-
deman, James R. Busch and
Richard P. Kenney. Dr. Fed-
deman is in the infirmary from

- 9 a.m.-11 a.m. each weekday

while doctors Busch and Ken-
ney alternate days from 4 p.m. -
5:30 p.m. On weekends the doc-
tors’ hours fluctuate.
Therefore, in order to find out
when the doctor will be in you
must call at 9 in the morning.

There are also three sets of
registered nurses’ Each nurse
serves an eight hour shift. June
Agnor from 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.,
Clara Hopkins from midnight - 4
p.m. and Joe McCown from
midnight - 8 a.m. Each nurse
works five days a week. To fill
the gaps there are three relief
nurses: Carol Calkins, Linda
Carter and Edna Ewald.

The infirmary offers all the
basic stock medications —
aspirin, cold medications, anti-
biotics, muscle relaxers and so
forth. All other medications are
given by prescription.

They are able to perform sim-
ple lab tests, give stitches, do
all sports physicals and do some
scholarship physicals. Allergy
injections are given from 7 p.m.
- 10 p.m. weeknights.

measles. However, the nurse
cannot force any student to re-

Coach Miller said that the
Generals ‘‘just got beat by two
better teams.”’

Washington and Lee travels
to Roanoke College Saturday to
compete in the ODAC cham-
pionship meet. Coach Miller
predicted an easy win by
Eastern Mennonite. According
to Miller the second, third, and
fourth places will be decided
between the Generals, Lyn-
chburg and Bridgewater.
Roanoke College, Emory and
Henry and Hamden-Sydney
should be of little consequence.

Miller stated that should the
Generals finish in one of the top
two places at Roanoke he would
then take the team to compete

Howell fights taxes, monopolies

by Carlos Peniche

Many hate him, many love
him, few are in between. He has
taken stands on issues that have
long rattled the heirarchy of the
Byrd Machine at a time when
you had to “‘go along to get
along’’ and breathe the
‘chloroform of conformity”’ in
order to make it in Virginia
politics. Consumer advocate, a
lead2r in human rights,
populist...the man _ being
described here is Democratic
candidate for governor, Henry
Evans Howell Jr.

Henry, as he prefers to be ad-
dressed has always been steps
ahead of the mainstream of
Virginia politicians. Things
most of us readily accept as
right today, Henry fought for
years ago. Howell was a leader
against the poll tax and fought
those forces who would rather
see kids, both black and white,
out of school rather than have
them share the same school.
His critics say he is  un-
sophisticated and yet it was
Henry who appeared before the
US and Virginia Supreme
Courts winning cases that
brought Virginia the concept of
‘‘one man one vote.”

Perhaps more than anything
else, Henry is known for his op-
position to excessive rates by
Virginia’s monopolistic
utilities. Commenting on VEP-
CO’s repeated rate-hikes,
Howell said “George Mason
wrote about taxation without
representation. Now it’s elec-
trification without justification.
Great Britain was almost as
powerful then as VEPCO is to-
day.”’ Here on W&L’s campus
is an economics professor who

will maintain that Henry who is
excessive and that he simply
doesn’t have the facts. Such
critics need to remember that it
is not Henry who makes the
final rate hike decisions but
rather the SCC and, in some
cases, the courts, who hear both
the Howell presentation and
that of the utility. Virginia con-
sumers saved over $140 million
when VEPCO, C&P and the
auto insurance industry at-
tempted to impose unjust rate
hikes on Virginians and Henry
went to court to stop them. Cur-
rently, the Norfolk Democrat is
working to end the automatic
fuel adjustment clause which
has been declared illegal in
neighboring North Carolina.

A major thurst of the Howell
campaign is to bring back more
home rule to Virginia localities.
This will increase the ability of
a Virginia citizen to take part in
events that affect his area
without imposing on _ other
localities. As an example, if the
people of Fairfax and Arlington
desire collective bargaining for
their city and county
employees, they can vote to
have this without forcing Lyn-
chburg, Lexington, or any other
area to have it. Howell will also
bring government and people
closer together with the
establishment of Citizens Ad-
visory Committees in direct
communication to the Gover-
nor’s office. This can be done
cheaply because through his wit
and dynamism he has attracted
a large number of dedicated
supporters who believe in his
ideals and would gladly serve
on such committees at little cost

to the taxpayer. One can only
appreciate this unique
phenomenon by working with
and seeing ‘‘Henry’s people’’ in
action.

It is clear to the anti-Howell
forces that a campaign based
on a fair and rational examina-
tion of the issues and the can-
didates’ records would result in
a Howell victory. Thus, huge
sums of anti-Howell money
have been accumulated to send
out distortions about Howell
through mass-mailings of let-
ters and literature. The In-
dependent Virginians for
Responsible Government at-
tempted to air anti-Howell ads
on TV, admitting that the ads
contained distortions, possible
falsehoods and _ statements
taken out of contest. No TV sta-
tion in Virginia would allow
such tactics on their channels.
The anti-Howell candidate
denies Virginians the opportuni-
ty to compare both candidates
through an open and face to
face debate.

*

The choice of this election is
clear. It is between ‘‘business
as usual,’’ by allowing the can-
didate of the bankers, insurance
companies and utilities to
govern Virginia in the same
stagnant fashion we have had
for years, on the one hand, and
government for and by the peo-
ple on the other. Regardless of
what people may think of the
man personally, few would
disagree with the view that
Henry Howell gets things done.
Now is the time Virginia can
finally move in to the twentieth
century.

WLUR will broadcast returns

by Jim Parker

It is Tuesday night. The 7th
day in November is coming toa
close. You have just spent a
hard night booking for an exam
the next day. You go out and
catch a buzz with some friends.
You return to your house and
decide to relax and listen to
WLUR and Third Ear. But wait,
instead of music flowing from
your stereo, it is the sound of a
broadcaster reporting that the
gubernatorial race in Virginia
has yet to be decided. You think
to yourself, ‘I must be really
messed up.’’ No, our fictitious
person is not messed up at all,
at least concerning what he
hears. For on next Tuesday,
Election Day, WLUR will begin
election coverage at 7:00 p.m.
and continues non-stop until all
the races have been decided.

A newsteam has been
organized by the WLUR staff to
report the election news. An-
choring the newsteam will be
WLUR news director Ed

Burgess and his assistant, Steve
Mattesky. There will also be a
number of WLUR staffmen who
will phone in election returns
and do general analytical work
Tuesday night. These returns
will not be as numerous as, say,
last year, which was a presiden-
tial and congressional year.
Nevertheless, there will be a
number of races covered. The
principal battle will come in
deciding the new governor.
Democrat Henry Howell and
Republican John Dalton will be
vying to obtain the post, former-
ly held by Republican Mills
Godwin. Other races include the
contests for state lieutenant
governor and attorney general
and the local struggle for the 9th
district House Delegate posi-
tion. Also being reported will be
the vote on a bond that will pro-
vide taxes for a flood project in
Buena Vista.

WLUR will concern itself with
election news from 7:00 p.m.
until the races are decided, but

the WLUR newsteam will not be
reporting all night long.
Burgess said that for the first 15
minutes of every half hour,
WLUR will switch its coverage
to the Virginia Public Radio
Election Network, of which
WLUR is a part. The VPREN
will broadcast late returns plus
reports from reporters on state
races, and will also analyze
results and indicate trends. The
15 minute segments apportion-
ed to the WLUR newsteam will
be using the same format, in
general, as that of VPREN, but
using local news instead of
statewide returns, said
Burgess. Reporters will phone
in election results which will
then be taped and aired at the
appropriate time. There will
also be some analysis of the
Tuesday vote. Burgess said that
some of the local winning or los-
ing candidates may be inter-
viewed on the station. Also,
reporters in the field will be

Dalton pushes

public jobs

by Steve Yeakel

The election of John Dalton
will go a long way in preserving
the qualities of responsive, effi-
cient government vital to
Virginia’s future. He will win
because Virginians have found
his views more in line with their
own, and because he has reduc-
ed the demagoguery of his oppo-
nent to rhetorical rambling.

John Dalton’s record as a

legislator has been as con--

sistently beneficial to Virgi-
nians as any politician’s in state
history. His perception of the
issues this year is no exception.
The major priority in a Dalton
Administration is Jobs for
Virginians — a job for every
Virginian who will work. John
Dalton assisted in providing the
economic climate that created
50,000 new jobs this past year.
He knows that, in order to con-
tinue this trend, we must stress
marketable skills in our educa-
tional process, encourage
business interests, keep taxes
from biting off too much of each
citizen’s paycheck, and expand
our energy supplies.
Concerning Virginia’s energy
policies, John Dalton has
already commissioned a task
force which has prepared a
comprehensive’ study of
Virginia’s energy problem and
proposed practical conserva-
tion solutions. He advocates full

development of our oil
resources on the outer continen-
tal shelf and better use of our
massive coal reserves. These
policies will help us avoid crises
of last winter’s proportions.
Open government is also a ~
key portion of a Dalton Ad-
ministration. As Lieutenant
Governor, John Dalton held
over 100 open-door meetings
around the state to help solve
head-on the problems of in-
dividuals with their govern-
ment. He will continue these
open-door meetings, and has
further proposed a monthly
People’s Day at the Capitol,
during which he will tak with in-
dividuals about their ideas and
problems. He is committed to
the partnership with people that
results in good government.
John Dalton has met these
and countless other issues
directly, and he presents prac-
tical solutions for tough pro-
blems. He has also been able to
cope with the barrage of un-
founded rumors and vicious
allegations so typical of his op-
ponent’s campaign style. As a
result, the Dalton ranks are
swelling with disoriented

Democrats who refuse to be

loyal to a candidate who has not
returned their loyalty in the
past. For all these reasons,
Virginia’s next great governor
is John Dalton.

by Robert Tremblay

Year in and year out I’m
amazed at the high quality of
singing displayed by the W&L
Glee Club. The reason for such
amazement is not due so much
to the difficulty factor involved,
though this singing certainly
isn’t easy, but that so few
members of the Glee Club are
actually musically trained.
Many of them can’t tell a C.
from an F major, but still they
can sing a technically deman-
ding piece like the Brahms’
RHAPSODIE beautifully. How
is this possible? Well, I would
like to say that the credit goes to
both parties, the singers and the
director, Gordon Spice. Both
share the honor but, in this
situation, I’m afraid that a few
extra kudis must go to Pro-
fessor Spice.

His handling of the Glee Club
last Friday night at Lee Chapel
during Parents’ Weekend was
truly masterful. Being able to
listen in on the rehearsals for
this concert, I can now see why
the Glee Club is so polished and
prepared. Professor Spice
treats these students like pro-
fessionals in that he wants
everything sung correctly, from
the smallest accent to the most
obvious crescendo. You would

expect such treatment of
singers if you were dealing with
students with musical
backgrounds. But this, in most
instances, is not the case.
Here’s where the Glee Club’s
hard work and talent really
pays off. These people are ob-
viously good and it is Professor
Spice who has molded them into
a superb singing unit. .

For example, for the first
selection on their program, the
Glee Club sang Grieg’s
Brother’s, Sing On. It was sung
marvelously, but what was tru-
ly impressive was that the
singers had no music in front of
them. The piece was memoriz-
ed, and though this is ! not easy
to do to begin with, when few
people in the Glee Club could
have told you the first pitch of
the piece, the accomplishment
is even more outstanding.

The Schubert Songs, though
they might seem easy, are pret-
ty tricky pieces, but again, the
Glee Club was up to the task. I
loved all of these, but I liked
everything on the program
anyway. Who wants to get
technical when the music is as
beautiful as it was.

The Brahms’ Rhapsodie was
the most difficult piece on the
program, but the singers and

ee Cla "Pralead

accompanist, Jay Taggart, who
was superb throughout, again
were magnificent. Mary Jane
Cooper, the contralto, was
equally as fine in a part that re-
quired such cut leaps as an oc-
tave and a fifth, certainly not
easy, and her tone throughout
was Clear and precise.

All in all, this concert was
nothing less than spectacular,
and though I was not able to
hear the newly-formed W&L
brass ensemble, they certainly
deserve mention also for they
began the proceedings.

The concert was concluded
with College Friendships and it
was a fitting conclusion to a
concert in which both the pro-
gram and the singing were so
obviously excellent, a perfect
combination, a combination I

look forward to in the next Glee ~

Club concert.

Fines...

Fines were levied against KA,
Lambda Chi and The Phi Kaps
by the IFC Tuesday night.

Kappa Alpha was put on a
week’s social probation beginn-
ing November 6-13 for conduct
unbecoming gentlemen at one
of the area women’s colleges.
The KA pledges were caught
digging up a hitching post at
Sweet Briar, resulting in a let-
ter of complaint being sent to
the W&L administration from
the Sweet Briar administration,
according to IFC secretary
Steve Jones.

Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa
Sigma, and Lambda Chi Alpha
were fined $50, $50, and $100
respectively for kidnapping
freshmen from the freshmen
dorm area. Lambda Chi was
fined for two offenses.

The IFC regulation regarding
kidnapping states no fraternity
related activity is to take place
in the freshmen dorms of the
dorm area.

% pledged

63.5% of the freshmen class.
have pledged a fraternity ac-
cording to statistics released by
the IFC Tuesday. 227 of 357
freshmen chose to go the frater-
nity route, and 22 second year
men entered brotherhood as
well.

IFC secretary, Steve Jones,

‘said these figures were in keep-

ing with past trends. He also
said this reflects the ratio of
non-frat to frat for the whole

student body.

tagged on to the end of it a
Stipulation that the lack of
adherence to the guidelines
would be considered sufficient
grounds for an honor violation
hearing. However, one EC
member said he thought, at the
time the motion passed
unanimously, this part was ex-
traneous to the main thrust of
the motion.

The same member said he
thought lack of adherence to the
guidelines would be grounds for
reconsidering the appointments
of Hulfish, Tucker and
Foreman. He said the three
may be “‘relieved of their jobs”
if it can be shown they did not
follow the guidelines.

Hulfish and Tucker were
unavailable for comment, but
Foreman said the SAB has been
following the accounting
guidelines. He said all the
receipts are placed neatly in lit-
tle files. On the question of night

deposit bags, Foreman said he
and Hulfish went to a local bank
to try to obtain them, but bank
officials were ‘‘skeptical’’ about
giving them to students. The
SAB reported this predicament
to the EC, Foreman said, and
vice president George Griffin
promised to look into it. He
never did, according to
Foreman. The SAB then sug-
gested getting a safe for its of-
fice, Foreman said. Again Grif-
fin promosed to look into it but
didn’t come through, Foreman
said.

Griffin responded that he had
in fact contacted Hulfish after
making an investigation of the
night deposit bag situation.
Griffin said that he directed
Hulfish to go to First National
Exchange Bank, where the
university has its accounts.
FNEB will give the SAB night
deposit bags’ Griffin said.
Previously Hulfish and
Foreman looked in to getting
the deposit bags from United
Virginia Bank, where the
university has no accounts, said
Griffin. Griffin said he made it
clear to Hulfish that he would
only look into buying a safe if
the SAB could not acquire night
deposit bags.

Another important issue the
EC discussed was
undergraduate use of the law
library. Undergraduate EC
members seemed to think that a

referendum conducted at the
law school on Friday asking
what should be done about pro-
blems undergrads cause in the
law library was superfluous
because law students can’t dic-
tate school policy. Goddard,
however, said the feeling
among law students is that ‘we
own the law school.’’ He said
Dean John had been ‘more
than willing to go along with
Student Bar Association
policy.”’ And he said he saw no
reason why John wouldn’t go
along with whatever is decided
by the referendum. He said two

of the referenda will have a run
off later this week. One referen-

dum would force
undergraduates. to register
before they could use the

library. The other referendum
requires that no obnoxious
behavior take place in the
library.

Goddard said some persons
“‘are really nuts’’ about
undergrads using the law
library. Doug Perkins, senior
EC representative, replied that
lots of undergrads ‘‘can:t stand
law students either, but we
don’t keep you from using our

facilities.”’

Other complaints by Goddard
were that undergrads won’t
move from law students’ car-
rels, trash the television room,
take over the main reading
room, are “not sensitive to the
need for quiet in the law school”
and, at one point, held a pizza
party in the faculty lounge.

In other action, Freeman
Jones was named to the Student
