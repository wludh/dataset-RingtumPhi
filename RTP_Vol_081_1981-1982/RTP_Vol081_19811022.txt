National Chapter Steps In To
Save SNU From Collapse

by Rob Schlegel

Rumors have been cir-
culating on campus this year
about the existence of Sigma Nu
fraternity. Regardless of what
you may have heard, however,
the Lambda chapter of Sigma
Nu at Washington & Lee has not
folded and, in fact, the fraterni-
ty is in a complicated rebuilding
year.

Sigma Nu’s troubles first
began with financial matters.

According to University
Treasurer Stewart Epley, the
fraternity borrowed money
from the university about seven
years ago for capital construc-
tion. Epley said that Sigma Nu
has met all its payments this
year and that the fraternity is
not in default. Epley also noted
that almost all the fraternities
on campus owe money to the
university.

fairs Dan Murphy had no com-

New Regulation Will Restrict Loans

‘by Bill Roberts

Guaranteed student loans will
no longer be available to anyone
regardless of income. A new
regulation requiring applicants
with family incomes over
$30,000 a year to demonstrate
financial need, became effec-
tive Oct. 1. Before that date
none of the eligibility re-
quirements for GSLs was based
on income.

The previous requirements
were full-time enrollment of the
applicant in an eligible institu-
tion, and state residency.
Students were not required to
demonstrate financial need.

The Director of Student
Financial Aid Michael D. Bar-
tini said last week, ‘‘The Oc-
tober 1 change will not have a
significant impact on students
during the 1981-82 school year,
since more than 90 percent of
this year’s Guaranteed Student
Loans have already been pro-
cessed.”’ Next year will be dif-
ferent. Bartini estimates that at

least 40 percent of the students
who received GSLs this year
will not be eligible next year.
This means that roughly 250 to
350 W&L undergraduates and
law students will be affected by
the new rule.

Fund Drive

by Patrick Jordan

The final phase of Washington
& Lee University’s 10 year
development program will end
December 31 with contributions
exceeding the $62 million goal.

According to Carter
McNeese, Associate Director of
Washington & Lee Develop-
ment, a self study was con-
ducted in the late 1960s. by the
university to determine what
needed to be spent to improve
the school.

By 1972, a two-part program
was formulated with a $36
million dollar contribution goal
by 1976 and an additional $20
million projection by 1979.

However, McNeese said con-
struction costs on projects like
the renovation of Tucker, Mc-
Cormick and Newcomb Halls
and the costs incurred in
building the law school and the
Warner Center were greater
than anticipated.

McNeese said the university
then decided to extend the se~
cond phase until December 31,
1981 with a new goal of $62-
million in contributions.

The rule requires students
whose family’s income is over
$30,000 to demonstrate a need
for financial aid. Need will be
defined by a standard formula.
The student’s ability to pay is

ment on Sigma Nu’s financial
problems, feeling that it was in-
appropriate for him to make a
statement.

Last spring matters began to
get out of hand.

Finances accumulated and
the university asked the SNUs
to get their house matters
straightened. The Student Af-
fairs Committee came close to
kicking out the Sigma Nu
Chapter. Consequently, in what
has been described by one
brother as a ‘‘coup d’etat,”’ new
officers were elected and began
to pull things around. The
elected officers are _ Bill
Dedrick, president; Chris
Stokes, vice-president; and
John Solitario, treasurer.

The university has had five
basic complaints about Sigma
Nu since last spring.

The problems are: house
dissension, financial debt to the
university, the lack of a faculty

adviser, complaints from Phi
Delta Theta that Sigma Nu
members had been throwing
bottles across the street and a
low-ranking house grade-poin!
average.

In a May 12 letter from Deai
of Students Lewis John t
Sigma Nu president Bi!
Dederick, the  universit:
notified the fraternity that the
Student Affairs Committee hac
placed it on Fraternity Proba-
tion as of June 8 for one year.

In addition, SAC provided
Stipulations that Sigma Nu
must abide by the decision to re-
main on campus. The decision
stated that an oversight com-
mittee must be found; that the
chapter pay in full all its past
financial obligations while re-
maining current with mortgage
payments; that the chapter not
be permitted to live or eat in the
fraternity house; that the

Saying they were pleased
with voter turnout, the Ex-
ecutive committee announced
that three constitutional revi-
sions had been passed by the
student body in a three day
referendum.

Students cast 1013 ballots,
representing 62 percent of the
undergraduate and law school
population. The constitution
provides that 50 percent of the
school must vote, and that each
revision receive a two-thirds
majority, to pass a proposal.

Proposals 4, 5 and 6 were
passed. The fourth moves law

third week of October.

Revision no. 5 specifies the
date of the end of a represen-
tative’s term as the commence-
ment date of his school. Revi-
sion 6 clarifies the language
describing the president’s
power to call a meeting of the
student body.

Although the E.C. acknowl-
edged that the revisions that
would give the E.C. powers of
review over the Publications
Board had failed, the balloting
on other proposals had not been
tallied by Wednesday.

EC May Establish Telephone Co-op

by Todd Smith

Morgan Griffith, ’82L Rep.,
spoke of establishing a commit-
tee that would guarantee stu-
dent telephone bills, thereby
eliminating the need for $50
deposit, at Monday night’s Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting.

The Committee also heard the
report of the Computer Club,
dealt with the University Com-
mittee and ‘‘Who’s Who’”’ nomi-
nations, and transferred their
reserves to a money market ac-
count.

Griffith told the committee of
a cooperative at the University
of Virginia in Charlottesville
that freed its members from the
obligation of putting down a
deposit when a telephone is pur-
chased.

Members would pay $5 - $10 to

belong to the organization,
which Griffith said would be
similar to the present Cold
Check Committee.

Fraternities at U.Va. can join
the co-op for $30, reported
President Eric Myers. The cost
of membership in any
Washington & Lee co-op is sub-
ject to debate.

The fund created by member-
ship fees, charged once a year,
would form a pool that would
reimburse the Central Tele-
phone Co. if a student failed to
pay his bill.

Transcripts could be withheld
if a senior failed to pay his bill,
Myers postulated.

Centel’s representative was
enthusiastic about the idea,
reported Griffith. “You could
see promotion in his eyes,’’ jok-

ed the third year law represen-
tative.

“There would be a lot of
paperwork involved,’’ said
Myers. “If we could carry this
out it would be one of the big-
gest services we could provide
the students.”’

After the first deposit a stu-
dent has a good credit rating
and need not pay deposits in the
future, said John Vlahoplus, ’83
Rep. The co-op would ‘‘just be
delaying the inevitable for some
people,’’ Viahoplus suggested.

Since a credit rating does not
improve if a student fails to pay
his bill, and because some
students who paid their bills
regularly on a hall phone not
listed in their name received no
credit at the telephone com-

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

SNU’s Rescue

And so at the eleventh hour, Sigma Nu was rescued
from the fire and delivered into the land of promise —
a promise that the Sigma Nu national chapter,
located conveniently in Lexington, will help
guarantee through a renovation of the house.

Considering the location of the SNU Lodge, the na-
tional chapter’s action saved the university from an
embarrassing situation. SNU, as most everyone
knows, is located in Red Square and is thus visible
from the Colonade or Lee Chapel. Imagine the in-
dignation of a tourist whose first image of Washington
and Lee is that of a red-brick fraternity full of
punched-out windows, shotgun-blasted doors, and a
front lawn full of beer bottles.

Fortunately, a few members of SNU had the good
sense to realize that their house was not long for the
world. Through a little reorganization, a little prod-
ding from the university (actually, a few direct
threats) and some pledges from the national chapter,
the SNU Lodge may have a future.

The university has demonstrated in this episode
that it will not follow a policy of laissez faire when one
of its fraternities is in trouble. Almost everyone
knows that fraternities are the bloodline of W&L’s
social life. The university does not want this social life
to decay — thus, the interest in keeping SNU afloat.

It was a long struggle for both the university and

the SNU Lodge, but some strong-arm tactics from
Nashington Hall and aid from its national chapter
nave extended Sigma Nu’s life at Washington and
Lee. One wonders if other fraternities will be as for-

tunate if they wind up in SNU’s predicament.

No More Loans?

From the Office of Financial Aid comes the alarm-
ing news that student loans will be harder to come by
in the future. Yes, all those recipients of loans who
voted for Ronald Reagan can expect a backlash that
may force them to withdraw from this private institu-
tion. Under the new regulation, students whose
parents earn more than $30,000 a year will find it
harder to get a loan from the university.

The new regulation has both its good and bad
points. Ideally, the regulation will cut back on the
amount of affluent students who take out loans only to
turn them into money-market certificates or
Treasury Bills.

Unfortunately, $30,000, after taxation and inflation,
is not such a lofty figure. The cost of a year of school
at Washington and Lee for two students amounts to
almost 50 percent of the $30,000 figure.

Washington and Lee students are known for their
rather conservative views. It is ironic that some
students may be forced out of attending the college of
their choice because of these conservative fiscal

policies.

College is viewed by some as a way to escape the
harsh facts of the real world. This change in the
availability of Guaranteed Student Loans is but one of
these facts.

Law Student Nukes The Phi

Dear Sir:

I read with interest your
editorial concerning the pro-
posed adoption of Amendment
Seven (giving the Executive
Committee powers of review
over student publications) ap-
pearing in your Oct. 15 issue. I
was especially intrigued by
your characterization of the
proposed amendment as the
replacement of professionals
(presumably, the editorial
board of the Phi) by amateurs
(presumably, the members of
the E.C.).

While I do not wish to express
an opinion to the advisability of
the adoption of Amendment
Seven, I cannot resist the oppor-
tuniity to comment on your
claim to ‘‘professionalism.’’ I
ask you, was it a group of
‘professionals’? who approved
for publication your Sept. 17 ad
fpr McCrum’s Drug Store, con-
taining a special deal on certain
prophylactics? Similarly, was it
a group of ‘‘professionals’’ who
approved for publication the by-
line appearing over Mr.
Amsler’s letter concerning that
ad which stated frankly, if in-
correctly, ‘‘Burned About Rub-
bers?”’ Or, on another note, was
it a group of ‘professionals’
who characterized, the E.C.’s
denial of funding to IVCF as
“E.C. Nukes _ Spiritual
Group...?”’

If so, I submit that you are in
the wrong profession. To the ex-
tent that the adoption of Amend-
ment Seven might correct these
professional blunders, I sin-
cerely hope it passes. With the
number of intelligent, mature
people that are to be found at

 

 

Washington and Lee, it is truly
regrettable that the student
newspaper so closely resembles

W&L Alumni Conference
Will Discuss Goals

by Patrick Jordan

A special conference for
Washington & Lee alumni to
discuss university goals and
procedures will take place to-
day and Friday.

According to Bill Washburn,
Alumni Secretary, 96 alumni
and their wives were invited to
the 11th annual meeting to ex-
amine the university’s financial

Situation, admission’s pro-
cedures and curriculum.
Washburn said _ invitations

were sent to the presidents of all
organized Washington & Lee
alumni chapters in the country
urging them to attend the con-
ference or if they had been
before to refer ‘“‘one or two
other alumni from their chapter
who would serve as excellent
ambassadors.”’

“The philosophy behind the
gatherings,’’ said Washburn,
“is that any alumnus can be
most beneficial to the universi-
ty when he knows a lot about
a

Washburn added the best way
to accomplish this is to invite
the alumni back to the school
for ‘‘intensive instructional ses-
sions about Washington & Lee
University.”

Washburn noted that the
“instructional sessions” are
designed for alumni feedback
and imput.

According to Washburn, the
wives of the alumni are quite
often the most opinionated, par-

Computers

To Help

Research

by Tom Baker

Taking advantage of com-
puter services being offered by
publishers, Washington & Lee
has acquired a program that is
designed to help students and
faculty involved in gathering
sources for extensive research.
The new program is actually an
information retinienal system
called Tialog. which is current-
ly being marketed by Lockheed.

According to Richard Grefe,
an assistant librarian, the pro-
gram is designed to put biblio-
graphic information that or-
dinarily appears in bound bib-
liographic indexes into data
bases in a computer.

The advantage of this system
is that students working on sub-
jects that require recently
published information do not
have to wait for publishers and
print indexes, a process that
can take months, to have a bib-
liographic citation of an article.

Publishers simply enter the
citations into data bases as soon
as the articles are printed.

(continued on page 10)

ticularly concerning matters
such as co-education.

Washburn said the two-day
sessions will concentrate on
four main topics entitled:
“University Finances Develop-
ment and Alumni Affairs,”
“Teaching at Washington and
Lee,” ‘‘Admissions, Student
Recruitment and Student Life,”
and ‘‘Athletics.”’

In addition to the meetings,
banquets are planned in Evans
Dining Hall both Thursday and
Friday nights for the alumni.

Washburn said the trustees,
who are also meeting this
weekend, are giving the Friday
banquet with a_ special
ceremony to honor three retir-
ing university trustees.

Engraving Missing

by Craig Narins
Last Friday morning, an
engraving by William Blake
was discovered missing from
Payne Hall. The engraving, a
representation of Chaucer’s
Canterbury Pilgrims has been
with the school for as long as

anyone can remember.
Although it had no real intrin-
sic value, the engraving was,
according to English professor
Sidney Coulling, ‘‘a part of the
tradition of the department.”
This was so partly because it
combined the work of two great
Englishmen, Blake and Geof-

frey Chaucer. Blake, who lived
from 1757 to 1827, is today con-
sidered one of England’s major
poets and most inspired artists.

The engraving, which hung on
the third floor of Payne, was
referred to by Dr. Coulling as a
“sitting duck” for anyone who
wanted to take it. The building
remains open all night long, and
the engraving was not really
protected in any way. Although
there is presently no evidence’
as to who took the engraving,
Coulling expressed hope that
the person who has it will return
it.

Natural Gas Costs
Certain To Increase

by Philip Murray

Natural gas costs will almost
certainly increase over the next
few years. It is impossible to
say exactly when or how much,
according to June Nicely, ac-
counting clerk at the Lexington
office of Columbia Gas of
Virginia.

Lexington customers of Col-
umbia Gas will already find an
approximately 20 percent in-
crease in their bills next month.
In addition, Columbia Gas is
seeking a 4.2 percent rate in-
crease from the State Corpora-
tion Commission.

Nicely said Columbia should
get the increase approved
sometime this week and im-
plementation will go into effect
in two or three months.

The 20 percent increase was
brought about by an increase in
the price of the gas purchased
by Columbia Gas for distribu-
tion. Ms. Nicely said rates vary
monthly depending on the cur-
rent price of gas.

Moreover, the price of
natural gas will continue to rise
through 1985 when the decontrol
of gas will be complete. This is
the first major jump in price
since the Natural Gas Policy
Act was passed in 1978.

Under this Act controls on the
wellhead price of newly
discovered gas are to be phased
out by 1985, but the controls re-
main on the about 40 percent of
gas already flowing which has
previously been found.

The purpose of the Act was to
narrow the gap between gas
and oil prices. However, in 1978
the price of crude oil was about
$15 a barrel. The current world
price is about $36. '

Nicely said that Columbia
Gas could not predict when
these price increases will take
place and how much they will
be. ‘The Federal Power Com-
mission is supervising the
decontrol process,”’ she said.

But Nicely said that their
studies show that gas will re-
main the most inexpensive
home heating fuel through this
century.

Commentary :

The Effects Of A
Rushed-Up Rush

by Scott Mason

I think regret is the best way to describe what I felt as I watched
the young freshman facing me struggle with words which would not
come and fight the tears that had already begun to fill his eyes,
regret not only for the emotion-stricken freshman who sat before
me, but for all freshmen who become entangled within the sorely
governed Rush system.

Despite what the ‘“‘Animal Houses’’ of America portray or what
ardent critics may claim, fraternities serve as one of the most im
portant institutions to literally thousands of men throughout the
country. Not only, in most cases, do fraternities bring a group of
men together in a common bond of brotherhood for a four year
period (often guffawed at by those who have never experienced
fraternity life), but this bond remains sealed throughout post-
college years as well. The relations among fraternity brothers are
often life-long relations, equal in strength and friendship to no
others. As a result, choosing which fraternity to join can be one oi
the most important decisions any individual has to make.

Why, then, the W&L (inter-fraternity council) chooses to begin
Rush upon the very first day’s arrival of freshmen seems to me an
astounding absurdity. Most freshmen are naive, confused, and ner-
vous, though eager, to begin their college careers. For many it
means the first time living away from the shelter of home, and for
all it means the arrival to an entirely new yet strange atmosphere,
an atmosphere which requires a certain degree of adaptation.

Understandably, Rush is a time of excitement, a time when
freshmen are able to meet other freshmen and upperclassmen as
well, while simultaneously (reviewing) individual houses.
However, too many freshmen become lost in this excitement and in
the immediate~bombardment of pressure which fraternities
unavoidably assert as a means of cajoling freshmen into ‘‘tearing.”
Yet even before all the commotion begins, freshmen must initially
eliminate seven of the seventeen fraternities which they choose to
visit, and this choice is made simply at random. Because freshmen
never have a chance to look at fraternities before Rush begins, they
have virtually no means of knowing which are most apt to coincide
with (each individual freshman’s likes). And during the three-week
melee, in addition to constant pressure, freshmen are subject to a
complete fake sense of reality which fraternities portray in the
hopes of gaining ‘‘pledges.”’ As a result, freshmen may join a house
disillusioned only to find out later, too much later, what the
house really has to offer.

And so it was with the freshman who sat before me with his head
in his hands and his eyes cast down to the ground attempting to tell
me of the mistake he had made. ‘“‘Too much excitement,”’ ‘‘just a
gut feeling,” ‘‘I...I can’t explain” were the broken phrases he ut-
tered in his fight to hold off the tears. I could sympathize, through
my own personal experience, with the ordeal he was going through
of depledging and respected this freshman for owning up to his
mistake. It is an ordeal which no freshman should have to suffer,
but with the Rush system the way it is, many do. Sadly, what’s
more, some refuse to recognize their mistake and may never really
enjoy their four-year tenure at W&L. As I viewed this particular
freshman, I was moved with pity. It is, indeed, a harsh state to see
a person agonize so, and even more harsh to realize his suffering
was needlessly due to a Rush system which cheats every freshman
out of an ample opportunity to choose a fraternity. It is more than
just a horrible shame. It is a bitter tragedy.

City Traffic Signal Moved;
Other Projects Completed

by Frank Jackman

The Lexington Public Works
Department moved the traffic
light on the corner of Main
Street and Nelson Street back
four feet last week in an at-
tempt to save the city money
and department work crews the
trouble of replacing it.

According to Public Works
Department Director David
Woody, the traffic light on the
East Nelson Street side of Main
Street has been knocked down
three times since August 1. At
one point it was knocked down
twice in one week. Woody

estimated that the light has
been knocked down 12 times in
the last five or six years.

It is usually large tractor
trailers trying to cut the corner
too sharp when making a right
turn onto Main Street that hit
the light, Woody said. About a
week ago, department work
crews moved the light back four
feet from the sidewalk in an at-
tempt to remedy the situation,
according to Woody. ‘‘Someone
will still find a way to knock it
over,’ Woody added.

The Public Works Depart-
ment is just finishing up work

on White Street, Woody said.
Work crews leveled off an 18
inch crown in the road between
Jackson Avenue and Jefferson
Street, according to Woody.
Work crews are also repairing
some sidewalks in the area,
Woody added.

Finally, the department will
conduct a practice run of the ci-
ty’s snow removal equipment
sometime in the next two weeks
according to Woody. Two years
ago it snowed in this area on
Oct. 10, catching state and local
officials off guard.

Entertainment
The Hills Are Alive

by Carren O. Kaston

Washington & Lee Universi-
ty’s Japanese Film Series,
sponsored by the East Asian
Studies Program, presents its
‘third movie, The Sound of the
Mountain, on Monday, October
26. The movie will be shown at 8
p.m, in classroom “‘A’’ of Lewis
Hall, the W&L law school, free
of charge. The public is invited.

The Sound of the Mountain (96
minutes) was directed in 1954
by Mikio Naruse. It is based on
the 1949 novel Yana No Oto by
Yasunari Kawabata, who won
the Nobel Prize for Literature
in 1968. Kawabata _ initially
hoped to become a painter, an
aspiration which is evident in
his novels, but his first stories
were published while he was
still in high school, and he then
decided to become a writer. He
is one of the few contemporary
Japanese authors to appear
with frequency in print in the
West.

The Sound of the Mountain
was the first novel by Kawabata
to be translated into English
after he was awarded the Nobel
Prize. It concerns a large ex-

-Film Notes

tended family, living in a
suburb of Tokyo, and the en-
tanglements across the genera-
tions of the members of this
family, especially the long-
suffering young wife Kikuko
and her father-in-law Shingo. It
is Shingo who hears ‘“‘the sound
of the mountain,” the faint rum-
ble in the hills that hints at
unknown occurrences, _in-
cluding dissolution and, per-
haps, death. The novel thus
places real, immediate, and
tangible events in a dreamlike
symbolic realm.

The career of Mikio Naruse,
the director of the film based on
Kawabata’s novel, embodies
the double heritage of Japanese
and Western culture typical of
Japan in this century and,
especially, after World War II.
Naruse favors understated por-
trayals of modern life. The
Sound of the Mountain falls into
the Japanese cinematic sub-
genre of the “wife-picture,’’ a
postwar mode generally con-
cerned with the struggles of a
wife for her identity in a society
which has for centuries taught
her only self-sacrifice.

 

Mr. Mike’s Mondo Video (1977) Originally made tor television but

cancelled at the last minute due to tastelessness, something pretty
rare for that medium. Written and directed by Michael
O'Donoghue of the original Saturday Night Live; he is perhaps best
remembered for an Uncle Remus skit with Garrett Morris and do-
ing imitations of Mike Douglas sticking needles in his eyes. Mondo
Video, which was universally panned, features SNL’s Jane, Lar-
raine and Gilda and a feline swimming contest. Shown by the SAB
this weekend; admission is $1.

Potemkin (1925) One of the masterpieces of cinema, directed in
the Soviet Union by Sergei Eisenstein with ground breaking use of
montage and editing for dramatic effect. This depicts the
repressive treatment of the masses by the regime in pre-Soviet
Russia, leading up to a major battle. Still riveting. The staircase
scene is unreal. Shown by the Journalism department Tuesday at 7
p.m. and9 p.m.

The public is invited to attend
the reception which coincides

While researching the book,
Flood spent a great deal of time
on the Washington & Lee cam-
pus and included many photo-
graphs from the university’s

“Lee: The Last Years” deals
principally with Lee’s presiden-
cy of Washington College (now
Washington & Lee University)
and his role as the prime healer
of the bitterness between North
and South after the Civil War.

Advance reviews have hailed
“Lee: The Last Years’’ as an in-
valuable contribution to the
body of Lee Scholarship.

One reviewer called the book
‘a masterpiece of narrative
biography.’’ Author Theodore
H. White commented: ‘Tragic
and powerful, with the rhythm
of a classic, the stupendous
research subordinated to the
emotion it evokes, it is the end

‘‘Publisher’s Weekly’’

dramatic recreation of the last
five years of Robert E. Lee a
joy toread.”’

Flood is a resident of Rich-

Review:

 

 

When You're Hot...

by Todd Jones

In the summer, things
get very hot. When the
temperature gets hot,
people sometimes do
things they later regret.
Murder is one of these
things. Body Heat is a
movie which deals with
the passion, desire, and
love of money that can be
intensified when people
stop thinking and let
other things take over.

Body Heat stars
William Hurt and
Kathleen Turner. Hurt is
a lawyer in a small town
in Florida. Turner is a
very beautiful wife of a
very, very rich man. A
man (Richard Crenna)
whom she despises. Hurt
and Turner meet at a
concert out in the hot
summer evening. The
two talk for a little while,
exchange innuendos, and
leave. Hurt decides to
search for her, and finds
her alone in a bar near
Miami. Naturally, they
end up in the bedroom,
but the line that Hurt
uses is surely an _ in-
teresting one (‘‘Can I go
over to your place and
see your wind
chimes?”’). We find out
that Kathleen is not only
insatiable in terms of her
sexual drive, but in her
greed for riches as well.
She and Hurt decide to
kill her husband, who
seems to have ties with
the Mafia. They are suc-
cessful, but clumsy. It
appears, though, they
will get away with the

crime.
However, strange
things begin to happen.
Important clues are be-
ing offered to the police,

but not delivered. The

police, as well as the in-
vestigator for the in-
vestigation into the death
of the rich husband, are
friends of Hurt. They
realize that Hurt was the
murderer, and are trying
to keep him from going to
prison by not accepting
these clues. However,
they cannot hold out
forever. This does not
especially bother Hurt,
but when his bedmate
(Kathleen) starts lying to
him, leaving town a great
deal, and playing around
with explosives (the
method involved in the
killing of the husband),
he becomes a little ner-
vous.

When Hurt is told to go
to her mansion, finds it
empty, but is standing in
front of a door in the
mansion which might be
triggered to dynamite, he
reaches the climax on
which the film is based;
does ‘Kathleen feel

stronger about her love
for him or would she
rather be free, in another
country, and very, very
rich?

Body Heat does not on-
ly have an interesting
plot, but also some of the
best direction I’ve seen
this year. Unusual
lighting, different
camera angles, and good
editing adds an extra ele-
ment of suspense to this
already chilling movie.

Director Lawrence
Kasden did an excellent
job.

William Hurt does a
pretty good job in his
role. He is, however,
completely overshadow-
ed by Kathleen Turner in
their scenes together.
Her characterization of a
greedy person who can
never get enough sex,
money, or power, is very
effective. Ted Danson
also puts in a good perfor-
mance as_ Lowenstein,
Hurt’s tap dancing, joke-

cracking, homosexual
friend.
Body Heat will hold the

interest of most movie-
goers for the entire

citing plot, good acting,

and excellent directing =
make this a film worth %

seeing.

composed of seventeen mem-
bers. The officers are President
Dennis Roberts, Charles
Thompson, and .Kevin Berger.
Practice sessions are on Mon-
days, Wednesdays, and
Thursdays from 4:30 p.m. until

Review:

 

Leon Bates

by Jim Baldwin

It is a rare occasion when one
hears a pianist like Leon Bates.
His concert Monday night in
Lee Chapel demonstrated his
ability to perform the most dif-
ficult works with both technical
excellence and artistic sen-
sitivity. Choosing the music of
Mozart, Schubert, Ravel, Rach-
maninoff and Chopin, Bates
provided a varied yet cohesive
program for his audience.

His smooth and expressive
renditions of both a Fantasie by
Mozart and two Impromptus by
Schubert were excellent, but
Gaspard de la Nuit by Ravel,
the most difficult work Bates
performed, was especially suc-
cessful through beautifully con-
trolled dynamics and smooth
execution of the most com-
plicated passages. The Etude
Tableaux of Rachmaninoff and
Chopin’s Sonata No. 2 were
equally impressive in their uni-
ty and effortless execution.
Bates also performed two en-
cores — one by Rachmaninoff
and the second by Mendelssohn.
The concert was truly enjoyable
and a rare opportunity to hear a

fine concert pianist.

Generals Hold O

by Dale Park

The Washington & Lee varsi-
ty football team ruined ODAC
rival Hampden-Sydney’s Home-
coming weekend for a second
Straight time as the Generals
handed the Tigers a 7-6 defeat.

W&L had defeated H-SC 20-0
two years ago at the Tiger
Homecoming, yet this year’s
contest saw much less scoring
by the Generals and much more
defense by both teams.

W&L took a 7-0 lead late in the
second quarter when soph-
omore quarterback Al Paradise
scrambled four yards for his
fourth touchdown run of the
year and junior Bill Devine add-
ed the extra point.

The score remained 7-0 until
late in the fourth quarter. With
only 3:14 left to play in the game
Tiger quarterback Tim Lass

threw twelve yards to wide-
receiver Brad Barlow for the
score. H-SC elected to go for the:
win and not the tie — but their:
two-point conversion pass at-
tempt fell incomplete.
Following the kick-off, the
Generals collected a pair of
first downs to run out the clock.
Commenting on the gradual
improvement of his defense,
head coach Gary Fallon noted:
“We've been putting our
defense on the field a lot these
past two weeks, but the players
have responded well by protect-
ing leads and securing wins. I

The Washington & Lee soccer
team snapped a three game los-
ing skid last Thursday by play-
ing Gettysburg College to a 1-1
tie. This left the Generals 3-4-1
prior to yesterday’s home game
with Roanoke College.

Head coach Rolf Piranian
believes that W&L controlled
Gettysburg after halftime. ‘“We
had a good second half and then
had the better chances in both
overtimes to win. The first half,
though, was really sloppy; I
was disappointed with the way
we played up to that point.”

Gettysburg got its goal late in
the first half. Bill Brown evened
it up for W&L one miuute into
the second half on an assist
from Mark Sullivan.

tell our players that it’s defense

The W&L—H-SC contest con-
tained 19 punts and only 227
total offensive yards between
the two teams. The win lifted
W&L’s ODAC record to 3-1 and
dropped Hampden-Sydney’s
conference mark to 1-3.

Next week the Generals will
take their 4-2 overall record
down to Sewanee, Tennessee, to
take on the _ high-scoring
Sewanee Tigers (University of

the South). Last week Sewanee
romped over Baptist University
56-16, and U.S.’s current 5-1
record also includes a 71-14
clobbering of Fisk University
earlier in the year.

“Clearly, Sewanee has been
able to generate points this
season,” remarked Fallon. ‘“‘I’
must admit that we’re a bit in
awe over a team which puts up
this many points. While our
defense has already faced some
strong challenges, Sewanee
could be the biggest one so far.”’

duties.

Before yesterday’s game, tri-
captain Ben Muskin gave his
view of why the Generals have
slumped following an _ im-
pressive 9-4-0 mark last season.
“There’s been plenty of effort
and we’ve had a good plan of
how to approach each opponent.
We definitely can’t blame in-
juries because it’s been a while
since Jeff Lating and Brad
Poorman got hurt. The real

Field next Thursday at 3:30

“The game should be highly
competitive not only from the
standpoint of the rivalry be-
tween the two schools but also
because the most recent games
we’ve had with them have been
decided by just one goal,” said
the coach.

ly at the same time. A few let-

have not been any problems
with anyone having a bad at-
titude.

This Saturday the Generals
are scheduled to play the first of
just two home weekend contests
of the season when they take on
9-1-1 Messiah College at 2 p.m.
Piranian says that Messiah’s
record is not the result of a
weak schedule. ‘‘They’re every
bit as good as their record in-
dicates.”’

by Rick Swagler

Earlier this season, in a meet
against Mary Washington Col-
lege, Lynchburg College illegal-
ly ran an unattached man ac-
cording to the Mary Washington
coach, Rick Wagenaar.

Wagenaar said that a Lynch-
burg alumnus “paced (Lynch-
burg’s) number-three man for
the last four miles.’’ Wagenaar
Stated that in the same meet
“four Lynchburg spectators
stepped in front of (Mary
Washington’s) number one man
and forced him to a complete
stop.”

According to W&L’s assistant
cross-country coach, Paul
Thomson, Lynchburg tried to
run alumni in their meet with
W&L several weeks ago. This
attempt was thwarted, how-
ever, when W&L threatened to
withdraw if the alumni ran.
Thomson called the Lynchburg
tactics “bush league” and com-
plained, as did Wagenaar,
about the verbal abuse the run-
ners received from the Lynch-
burg fans.

Wagenaar said ‘(Mary
Washington) is never going to
run at Lynchburg again unless
it is absolutely necessary. If we
do run there, I’m going to have

‘an NCAA representative pre-

sent.”’
Not surprisingly, Lynch-
burg’s coach, Jack Toms,

denied that he ran alumni
against Mary Washington and
that he tried to run them
against W&L.

Coach Al Buehler, track
coach at Duke University end
chairman of the NCAA Track
and Field Rules Committee,
quotes the cross-country
rulebook as saying, ‘‘ ‘no aid or
assistance can be given a run-
ner from anyone directly or in-
directly: associated with that
team...’ which includes running
alongside the man.’’ The penal-
ty for this, according to
Buehler, is disqualification of
the runner who received the
aid.

Commenting on the spec-
tators stepping in front of the
Mary Washington runner,

Buehler said ‘‘The meet direc-
tor, in this case the Lynchburg
coach, is responsible for crowd

control, but verbal abuse does »

The Ring-tum Phi, Oct. 22, ..01, raye /

eo

not tie in with this. The fans can <@

say whatever they want.”’

Buehler said that Wagenaar
“should have protested the #
meet.”’ Wagenaar, on the other §
hand, stated ‘‘We’re going to ,

use it (Lynchburg’s conduct) as

an incentive. We can’t wait ‘til #

State to run against them.”’

In reference to Lynchburg’s
“unethical conduct’? Coach
Buehler commented: ‘Well,
there are skunks
business.’’
Washington and Lee Cross
Country team rolled up its
largest winning margin of the
season this past Friday,- Oc-
tober 16, in a 18-40 win over
Bridgewater College. The
Generals who stand 5-2 on the
season, will travel to WEST
Virginia Tech this Saturday,
Oct. 24. Sophomore Angus
McBryde led the charge against
the Eagles, claiming first place

Mermen 1-2 In Bucknell Tourney

by G. Bruce Potter

Facing their toughest com-
petition of the year following a
week of haphazard practices,
the Washington & Lee water
polo team (17-4) compiled a 1-2
record at the Bucknell Tourna-
ment last weekend.

The Generals easily dispatch-
ed Cornell, 16-8, in their first
game but then suffered losses to
Slippery Rock, 13-9, and Brown,
12-8. Slippery Rock finished se-
cond in the event, losing in the
final to the New York Athletic
Club. This makes the Rockets,
who have downed W&L three
times this season, the top col-
legiate team on the East Coast.
Brown and Bucknell tied for
third.

‘“‘We did what we had to do
—beat Cornell (W&L lost to Cor-
nell by six goals last year),’”’ ex-
plained Coach Page Remillard.
‘“‘We’re really happy that
although we were going to a na-
tionally prominent tournament,
we didn’t compromise our-
selves philosophically. We
believe in academics. Due to
papers and mid-term exams,
we did not have a single
workout last week with the en-
tire team, and several people
missed several days.”’

One of the Generals’ goals
this year is to accumulate a
team GPA of 3.0.

Remillard cited two other
problems that led to the losses.
Goalie Andy Gates only stopped
half of the shots against Slip-
pery Rock and 45 percent
against Brown. ‘‘Our goalies
are not making the big saves,”
said Remillard.

When Slippery Rock made an
offensive change against the
Generals, Remillard had the
choice of one of two defensive
switches. He chose the one that
fell right into Slippery Rock’s
offense. Although Erik Peter-
son tallied six times for the
Generals in that game, the
Rockets hole man (similar to a
center in basketball) countered
with seven goals.

The second quarter was the
decisive one in the Slippery
Rock match-up as the Rockets
outscored W&L, 4-1. However,
the Generals came out firing
against Brown and quickly
scored the first goal, only to sur-
render three goals in two
minutes to fall behind by three
at the end of the first quarter.

Sophomore co-captain Tim

Rock was outstanding in the
field, although his shooting was
off according to Remillard.
Peterson shot 59 percent to
score 16 goals for the three
games and is “developing some
consistency”’ said Remillard.
However, Rock is having pro-
blems overcoming situations
when he is double-teamed

The sophomore left campus for
personal reasons without telling
Remillard earlier this week,
missed two practices, and will
be benched one weekend for

‘‘When you're doing as well as

type incident and this could be
it. I think the team will rally

While the W&L football team
was beating Hampden-Sydney
Saturday, there was another
violent game taking place. The
W&L rugby team travelled to
Farmville as well. The
Generals A squad fell, 20-4,
while the B team won, 4-0.

‘‘We were down by eight at the
half,” said Player-Coach Todd
Alexander. ‘“‘We came _ back
with a try in the second half but
that was when the mistakes set
in.”

A try is the rough equivalent
to a touchdown in football. It is
worth four points and the extra
point is kicked from the same
angle to the goal post at which
the player entered the end zone.
Field goals, worth three points,
are an additional method of

scoring.
“We have lots of  inex-
perience,” Alexander states.

“Basically, they capitalized on
our mistakes and we didn’t
capitalize on theirs.”’

“We really have about five

Ruggers Split Matches

people out that have ever
played before,”’ commente
Herb Funson.

The team, comprised of 20-25
players, is divided into two
squads, the A unit and the B
unit. The A game is generally
thought to be the more impor-
tant match.

‘In rugby, everybody plays,’
said Alexander. “It’s not like
football, where you have a first
team.”’

The returning experienced
players inlcude Funson, Alex-
ander, Andy McClellan,
Spencer Dickinson, and Dave:
Cordell.

The ruggers have played only
one other match besides Satur-
day’s. The A team lost 23-4 to
Virginia Tech. The W&L club
will travel to the University of
Virginia this Saturday to play
their next match. With each
match, the club is gaining;
necessary experience.

“It'll start to look better
toward the end of the season,”
offered Funson.

Feldman, Nankin Win Trophy

Washington & Lee University
debaters Lee Feldman and Ken
Nankin were awarded a
quarterfinalist trophy at the
Pace University Debate Tour-
nament in New York City last
weekend.

Feldman, a sophomore from
North Miami Beach; Fla., and
Nankin, a freshman from Col-
umbia, S.C., finished ahead of
several of the more prestigious
debate teams on the North-
eastern debate circuit.

Nankin also was named the
eighth varsity speaker at the
annual Johns Hopkins Debate
Tournament in Baltimore, Md.,
recently. The debate was judg-
ed, in part, by members of the
Young Lawyers Section of the

203 N. MAIN ST.

Hours: Mon.-Fri. 9:00-6:00
Sat. 9:00-2:00

 

tion. Nankin’s achievement is
all the more impressive since
he won in the varsity division
although he is only a novice
debater as defined by tourna-
ment rules.

This year’s national debate
resolution is: ‘Resolved: That
the federal government should

significantly curtail the powers
of labor unions.’’ Washington &
Lee’s affirmative case is the
repeal of the Davis Bacon Act,
enacted during the New Deal
and felt by many economists
and politicians to be infla-
tionary, particularly in the
building trades industry.

Confrontation Erupts
Among Law Candidates

by Todd Smith
A debate among law students

| campaigning for the empty first

law representative’s seat on the
Executive Committee brought
an open challenge to the single-
sanction honor system, alleging
that it caused fear among
undergraduates.

Seven law freshmen contend-
ing for the vacant seat were
also questioned about the Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship
budget issue, and the need for a
first year E.C. election to be
held before the Student Bar
Association makes its budget
request.

Jim Green, who had challeng-
ed the other candidates to the
debate, suggested a Biennial
referendum (every other year)
for students to approve to
discard the single sanction that
rule mandates that all infrac-
tions of the honor system by
punished with removal from the
university.

Green also suggested that the
students vote on opening the
records of honor trials. ‘‘(The
honor cases) would provide a
catalogue of precedent to see if
the E.C. is following precedent
or is behaving in a whimsical
fashion.”’

“‘T think the single sanction is
fine as it stands,”’ stated Dona
Szak. She disagreed with the
opening of honor hearing
records. “If worse comes to
worse, and the accused has a
jury trial, then the student body
will know the facts.”

Booher pointed out that at
Dartmouth, a school with an
open honor system, some trials
were of a nature that required
closing them to the student
body. Although the Dartmouth
student government disciplines
with multiple penalties, the ef-
fect is that honor cases result in

expulsion for the convicted.

Responding to Green’s drop-
ped aside that undergraduates
are said to live in fear of the
E.C., candidate Greg Walker
said, ‘If the undergraduates or
others feel afraid of tbe E.C., I
think they themselves are hav-
ing problems with a stringent
system.” Approving the W&L
system, Walker added that
many who fear they will be rip-
ped off are those who take the
possessions of others.

Jim Forte, a graduate of W&L
and sitting in the audience, saic
that he had noticed the fear tha‘
comes from living under the
honor syStem, and suggestec
that there was a problem ii
Walker couldn’t see that fear.

“Is the answer that to the ma-
jority that if they can’t conform
they ought to transfer?” asked
Forte.

W&L alumnus candidate Jim
Faulk responded, “I know I
didn’t live in fear...You in this
room are living under the honor
system and you aren’t trembl-
ing.”

Jim Forte charged, “If you
think the E.C. will make
allowance for one mistake from
an honorable student, you’re
wrong. Most cases are dismiss-

ed for a lack-of evidence.” He.

then said that he knows of many
such cases.

Szak suggested that many
law students felt uncertainty
about the rules of plagiarism
and the possibility of making a
mistake.

“I don’t believe there is such
thing as an inadvertent honor
violation,’ stated Jamie Canup.
Others also rebutted the argu-
ment that a small error would
result in expulsion.

Responding to questions con-
cerning budgeting, Green said

that he felt religious organiza-
tions like the Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship should
fund themselves. He later said
that funds should be allocated
according to membership
numbers.

IVFC was denied financial
support by the E.C. because it
was allegedly exclusive and
religious by nature.

Szak rebutted Green anc
others, who said that W&L was
unsupported by state anc
therefore the ‘church and
state’ issue could be easily
shrugged off. She also question.
ed funds for any organization,
no matter how many members
it had, that was exclusive.

Candidate Tom Shepherd
disagreed: ‘“‘This is the human
quality of a small school’s
governing body: you have peo-
ple in there and they aren’t go-

-ing to adhere to a rigid set of

rules, and I don’t think they
should.”

“I think that if a group of
students have paid their money
they should get back their fair
share,” said Shepherd.

All the candidates echoed the
need for earlier representation.
One questioner stated that it
was impossible for students to
ascertain the honor of a can-
didate before an early election,
and asked if the budget hear-
ings could be put off instead.

The candidates agreed that it
was easier to move the election
than the budget hearings, con-
sidering the need for funds
before October.

They made that judgment
before the failure of a student
body referendum that would
have moved back the date.

They made that statemen!
before the students ratified the
change in dates by constitu-
tional referendum.

Ottenheimer Foundation Endows W&L Law School

The Ottenheimer Brothers
Foundation of Little Rock, Ark.,
has established a $25,000 en-
dowed scholarship fund for the
Washington & Lee University
School of Law.

Gus Ottenheimer, director of
Ottenheimer Brothers Founda-
tion, graduated from the W&L
law school in 1917. He and his
brother, Leonard, are in the in-
vestment and real estate
business in Little Rock.

The $25,000 endowment will
fund the Ottenheimer Brothers
Scholarship, which is to be
awarded annually toa W&L law
student from Arkansas.

The first Ottenheimer
Brothers Scholarship was
awarded in August to David
Herbert Pennington, a native of

Rock following his graduation
from W&L. He later moved to
Providence, R.I., where he
spent three years as vice presi-
dent of a business firm before
returning to Little Rock to enter
business with his _ brother,
Leonard.

The result was the Ot-
tenheimer Brothers Manufac-
turing Company, which manu-
factured ladies ready-to-wear
for about 30 years and
employed 800 workers when the
brothers sold out in 1955.

The Ottenheimer Brothers
continued its business ac-
tivities, including the develop-
ment of ‘Cloverdale,’ a sub-
division that opened up the
growth of southwest Little Rock
where the Ottenheimers built

“This gift ...will benefit deserving
students for many years to come.”

President Robert E.R. Huntley

Fayetteville, Ark. Pennington
graduated from the University
of Arkansas, where he majored
in political science and was
elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He
entered the W&L law school this
fall.

Announcing the university’s
receipt of the Ottenheimer
Brothers Foundation gift,
Washington & Lee president
Robert E.R. Huntley said: ‘‘We
are grateful for the generosity
the Ottenheimer Brothers
Foundation has shown in mak-
ing this gift, which will benefit
deserving students for many
years to come.”’

Gus Ottenheimer was 20
years old when he earned his
law degree from W&L. He prac-
ticed law for six years in Little

about 450 homes.

Ottenheimer Brothers re-
mains active in various kinds of
investments today in spite of
the brothers’ ages — Gus is 84,
Leonard is 89.

Gus Ottenheimer has long
been an avid supporter of
higher education. He was ex-
tremely active in the develop-
ment of the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock. In the
1950s, he was chairman of a
committee that recommended
changing Little Rock Junior
College to a four-year institu-
tion. After that was accomp-
lished in 1957, he headed a com-
mittee that recommended the
merger of the Little Rock
University with the University
of Arkansas; that plan was

adopted by the state legislature
In 1969.

In 1978, Gus Ottenheimer was
awarded an honorary doctor of
law degree by the University of
Arkansas at Little Rock. He is
currently a member of the Uni-
versity of Arkansas at Little
Rock’s Development Council.

Active in numerous civic ac-
tivities in Little Rock, Gus Ot-
tenheimer is past director of the
Arkansas Chamber of Com-

merce and past chairman of the
board of the Metropolitan Area
Planning Commission, and also
past president and chairman of
the board of Associated In-
dustries of Arkansas.

In 1935, Gus Ottenheimer
founded the Institute for Inter-
national Understanding which
later was adopted and spon-
sored by Rotary International.
The program developed an an-

nual attendance in excess of one
million which included ac-
tivities in Europe.

Gus Ottenheimer has been
listed in ‘‘Who’s Who in
America” for a number of
years. He was a director of the
National Association of Manu-
facturers for nine years, two of
which were by presidential ap-
pointment as a director-at-large
representing manufacturers in
all the states.

 

 

Library Announces Appointments

The University Library,
Washington & Lee University,
announces two appointments to
its faculty.

John S. Coleman, Assistant
Professor and Director of the
Audio-Visual Center, effective

Oct. 1, 1981.: Coleman is a
graduate of Radford College
and earned his M.L.S. degree
from the University of North
Carolina.

Dr. Richard W. Oram, Assis-
tant Professor and Special Col-

lections Librarian, effective
Sept. 1, 1981. Dr. Oram earned
the B.A. degree from the Uni-
versity of Illinois, both the M.A.
and Ph.D. degrees from Cornell
University, and the M.L.S.
degree from the University of
Texas.

There are over 140 data bases
and subject headings in the data
bank.

Also, a student does not have
to spend the time going through
periodical indexes. The com-
puter lists the references and,
as the saying goes, what once
took hours and days is now done
in minutes.

Although this system is very
common among graduate pro-
grams, Grefe knows of very few
four-year liberal arts colleges
that have this facility.

The library is involved in a
promotional campaign to in-
form students and faculty about
the system. Although each in-

formation search is expensive,

costing from $40 — $300 per
hour, the library is doing sear-

New Regulation To Affect 40 Percent Of Loans

(continued from page 1)
determined by evaluating the
family’s income, assets, and
liabilities. The amount of aid a
student will then be eligible for
is the difference between a stu-
dent’s ability to pay and the cost
of education. Anyone who can-
not demonstrate an inability to
meet the cost of education will
not receive a loan. Those ap-
plicants whose family income is

below $30,000 will not have to
demonstrate need in order to
qualify.

In dollar terms, this means
W&L will receive next year
about $800,000 less in GSLs than
it did this year. The Financial
Aid Office has processed over
$2-million in GSL funds for the
1981-82 school year.

Bartini emphasized that there
are alternative sources of

EC Debates Phone
Co-op With CenTel

(continued from page 1)
pany, the co-op idea still seem-
ed viable to the committee.

The E.C. decided to recon-
sider the idea after it had been
researched further.

Lee Feldman and Jay
O’Brien reported that the com-
puter club had received the sup-
port of President Robert E.R.
Huntley.

“The president told us that he
felt it should be a mutually
shared obligation,’’ said
Feldman, ‘‘with the school pay-
ing for hardware items...and
the E.C. taking care of office
supplies, etc.”’

Vice President Jim Averett,
who had been ridiculed by the
E.C. at the Oct. 28 budget hear-
ing when he promised that he
would “personally go talk to
President Huntley,” said that
he had been expecting more in-
formation from the club before
going to the President, but the
club evidently went around
him.

The club did ask for
assistance in getting the Mock
Convention to lend them their
computer terminal which they
need for their daily ‘help ses-
sions.”’

Because no petitions were
submitted by freshmen seeking
a seat on the University Com-
mittee, President Myers sug-
gested that the E.C. appoint the
freshman class vice president
to the position, as Dean John
had suggested.

Averett asked why the vice
president should have the posi-
tion instead of the president.
Myers replied that it was an
equitable division of respon-
sibility, and the Committee ap-
proved, with Griffith opposing.

Ted McQuiston, ’84 Rep.,
questioned the effectiveness of
the University Committee, say-
ing that he had heard that the
U.C. did practically nothing.

Junior Averett and Frank
Smith, ’83 Rep., were appointed
to submit student nominations
to a ‘‘Who’s Who’’ selection
committee. ‘“‘Who’s Who Among
College Students’’ is a nation-
wide, annual publication.

After Smith reluctantly ac-
cepted the appointment, Ben
Hale, ’84 Rep., joked, ‘I pro-
mise we'll get you a quote in the
paper for it.”’

Hale and Averett reported
that Dean John would transfer
the E.C.’s reserve account
funds to a money market ac-
count leaving $1500 for every-
day use in the funding account.

Averett said that the penalty
from withdrawing from a
Dreyfus account, “‘really only a
glorified checking account,”
was minimal.

10-Year Plan May Raise

funds, and that students should
be aware of them. A new
federal program will allow
parents of students to obtain
guaranteed loans of up to $3,000
a year at 14 percent interest.
Repayment would begin 60 days
after the loan is issued. These
loans will be available through
local banks and other lending
agencies.

Bartini is optimistic. He ad-

vises students ‘‘to keep inform-
ed about Guaranteed Student
Loans by reading newspapers,
talking to lenders, and to the
Financial Aid Office.”’

“‘T will be able to tell you what
is going to be available,’’ is Bar-
tini’s offer.

The Oct. 1 change in GSL
eligibility requirements is a
direct result of the Reagan ad-
ministration’s federal budget

cuts. The U.S. Government
pays most of the interest on
these loans, and guarantees
them against default. The costs
to the government of subsidiz-
ing the low interest rates on
GSLs have become
astronomical in the last few
years. Bartini said of the
change in eligibility re-
quirements, ‘‘It is a reflection
of the times.”’

Sigma Nu Rescued At Last
Moment By National Chapter

for having a faculty advisor;

The contributions to the
university, said McNeese, come
from alumni, friends of the
university, corporations and
various foundations.

McNeese refused to comment
as to who the largest contri-
butors to the fund were but he
said it is well-known that Sidney
Lewis, owner of Best Product:
Corp., contributed $9-millior
towards construction of the
university law school.

McNeese said the money con
tributed to the university durin;
the 10-year development pro
gram is spent not only on im
proving university facilities
but also in lowering each stu
dent’s tuition by supportin;
Washington & Lee’s operating
budget.

McNeese said the actual cost
to educate each student is $7,000
but that each student receives
about $3,000 in endowment
benefits and various other con-
tributions from corporations
and foundations.

IFC president, the chapter’s
faculty advisor, and _ two
members each from Sigma
Nu’s National organization and
the Sigma Nu Alumni House
Corporation. This committee
meets with the chapter
monthly.

The stipulation concerning
the use of the fraternity house
resulted from a house inspec-
tion by Professor of Engineer-
ing Henry Ravenhorst, who
made a bad report about the liv-
ing conditions. Renovations
totalling $40,000 must be com-
pleted on the house before it can
come into use again.

Two meetings last week in-
volving the Lambda Chapter
and the Sigma Nu Nationals
resulted in a decision to turn to
receivership. This means that
the alumni and national cor-
poration now possess the power
to run the local chapter of
Sigma Nu.

While the chapter is now in
more secure hands, one disad-
vantage is that everything, in-
cluding social activities, is con-
trolled by the Nationals and the

alumni.

Thanks to this receivership,
Sigma Nu is back on its feet.
One alumnus, Charles Murphy,
plans to raise money and donate
it to the Lambda Chapter as
soon as he is content with the
way house affairs are handled.
This national alumni drive
would raise at least $50,000.

Although Sigma Nu fraternity
is turning things around this
year, it has lost seven
members, including the Rush
chairman and social chairman.
However, the fraternity has
received at least five pledges so
far this year.

Next year will be Sigma Nu’s
100th anniversary at Washing-
ton & Lee. The chapter is in a
rebuilding stage, trying not only
to turn around its problems, but
also its reputation. The Sigma
Nus had to deal with a great
disadvantage in this year’s
Rush because of bad-mouthing
concerning the fraternity. One
Sigma Nu member said, ‘‘The
university is looking to kick us
off at the smallest thing.”’
