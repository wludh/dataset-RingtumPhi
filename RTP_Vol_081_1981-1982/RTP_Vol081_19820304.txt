After several months of seem-
ingly unending winter weather,
_ Washington and Lee students
will be given a break this
weekend when the school
celebrates this weekend’s 75 an-
nual Fancy Dress Ball.

The F.D. festivities, which
begin with tonight’s concert in
Cameron Hall by the Atlanta
Rhythm Section, promise to be
three days of fun and merri-
ment for all partakers.

The ARS concert is only one
of several musical _perfor-
mances, which vary from the
big band sound of Lester Lanin
to the soul and beach music of
the Voltage Brothers and
Chairmen of the Board.

Fancy Dress is normally a
special time at Washington and
Lee, and the 1982 ball is of par-
ticular note since it is the 75 an-
niversary of the founding of the
winter dance/party in 1907 by
Miss Annie Jo White. Naturally,
the theme of this year’s ball is
“Fancy Dress 1982: A Diamond
Jubilee.”’

Being a special anniversary
and all, the ball has undergone

some changes. First, Friday

to an end the cramped tradition

facilities to provide all forms of

entertainment for the guests.

The featured performer is
Lester Lanin, an _ orchestra
leader noted for his connections
with the First Couple and
various bigwhigs in the Big Ap-
ple. Lanin will perform from
8:30 to approximately midnight
in Warner Center.

Thursday night’s concert has
also been moved to more
spacious locale. Last year
featured concert, John Prine,
was held in Warner Center. This
year, ARS will be given more
breathing room in V.M.I.’s
Cameron Hall.

Inside the gym, the S.A.B. has
provided a bevy of musical
treats.

Those seeking faster and
more contemporary music will
find just that in the sounds of
the Voltage Brothers and
Chairmen of the Board. The
bands will occupy stages at op-
posite ends of the old gym.

For those who do not par-
ticularly like the sounds of
beach or soul, relief is on the
way in the form of Skip Castro.

will start up in the old, not the
new, gym.

While music is echoing below,
F.D. strollers can take in the
‘“‘theme’’ rooms which will be
located on the 500 level of the
gym. The themes, drawn from
F.D.’s of the past (this is
supposed to be a retrospect)
will include ‘‘Gay Paris,” “The
Roaring Twenties,’ and
‘Monte Carlo Night.”

If Friday and Thursday’s
events are not enough, there is
always the rest of the weekend,
including a Saturday afternoon
grain party at Zollman’s that
features the Offenders and
various parties Saturday night
and Sunday. Clearly, Fancy
Dress has progressed beyond
the level of a one-night gala.

Perhaps the best indication of
the popularity of this event is
the quick movement of sales
this past week. F.D. tickets, at
$25 apiece, have been moving
fast all week. The ARS concert,
which offered seats at $3 apiece,
had sold 500 seats on the first
day of ticket sales.

Applications for a new ex-
change program between W&L
and Bates College are due on
March 15, according to Dean
Pamela Simpson.

Bates is a small co-ed institu-
tion in Lewiston, Maine, about
140 miles northeast of Boston. It
enrolls approximately 720 men
and 706 women and has the
distinction of being the first co-
ed college in New England,
founded just after the War be-
tween the States.

Wonder of wonders — Dean
Simpson says that Bates runs
on a calendar identical to
Washington and Lee’s. This is
truly phenomenal in its own
right, but will also be most con-
venient for those who want to
attend for just one term.

Unlike other exchange ar-
rangements, in which students
pay tuition to their own school,
W&L students going to Bates
will have to pay that school’s
rate and vice-versa. Tuition at
Bates runs slightly higher than
at W&L, according to Simpson.

 

Bates Applications Due

Criteria for the exchange pro-
gram was passed by the Com-
mittee on Courses and Degrees
and goes something like this:

The program is offered to
sophomores and juniors for one
semester, one semester plus
shortened spring term or for the
entire year. It will be limited to
five students with no exchange
on a one-to-one basis. Decision
must be made by March 15 for
the fall and October 15 for the
spring term.

Students must be ‘‘in good
standing,”’ receive an endorse-
ment from the dean of the host
institution and “approval of
other agencies such as off-
campus study committees as
deemed appropriate by the
home institution.”

Those interested in more
details should flock to the office
of Dean Simpson, who says
Bates provides an opportunity
to take different courses in a co-
ed environment in another loca-
tion.

W&L students who plan on at-

V.M.I.’s Cameron Hall are
reminded that the building has
a few regulations against the
bootlegging of alcohol and any

possession, sale and distribu-

by Scott Mason

Lexington City Mayor
Charles Phillips said he does
not plan to investigate a matter
concerning alleged selective en-
forcement by the Lexington
Police Department in the form
of noise violations and permits
to amplify music.

In regard to a story that ap-
peared in the Feb. 11 issue of
the Ring-tum Phi which cited
several specific documented in-
cidents of selective enforce-
ment, Mayor Phillips said that

  

carrying glass beverage con-
tainers, metal beverage con-
tainers or other types of coolers
will be permitted into Cameron
Hall.

Cameron Hall officials also
remind students that seizures
are possible, but only will be
conducted with the consent of
the patron. All people caught by
police or security officials will
be prohibited from attending
the concert and will be turned
over either to V.M.I.’s security
force or the nearest Virginia

until he receives a complaint in-
volving the matter, he has no in-
tention of looking into the
allegations.

Phillips said that, despite
evidence gathered from police
records and eyewitness
testimony, he has no proof nor
knews who is involved or who is
accused.

Phillips feels he is _ not
justified in acting solely on the
basis of a news story and will
not consider the matter until a

Any patron found to be carry-

do this, he will be given the op-
tion of having his ticket refund-
ed.

Despite the seriousness of the
issue and the extensive evi-
dence pointing to what appears
as police deviations from the
Lexington Charter and Code of
Laws, any investigation has yet
to be initiated. The allegations
concern not only Washington
and Lee fraternity houses but
involve the entire Lexington
community as well.

The Lex‘ngton community so
far has had to rely upon the con-
fidence that Mayor Phillips has
in the Lexington Police Depart-
ment. When evidence such as
that indicating alleged selective
enforcement exists, it is im-
perative to the welfare of the
community that the matter be

by Todd Jones
Taps is a movie with many messages. It is ob-
vious that Director, Co-Screenplay Author Harold
Becker had something to say about guns, guts,
honor, truth, kids, adults, and the military. All of
these issues are brought up during the length of
the movie Taps.

The plot of the movie is that a military academy
is Scheduled to be closed. The seniors at the high
school will be allowed to finish their year during a
short session. However, during a rumble with
some of the townies, the headmaster’s gun is ac-
cidentally fired. A townie dies, and the head-
master has a heart attack. The Board of Trustees
announces that the school will be closed im-
mediately. The head student decides otherwise,
and orders all the students to instigate a military
take-over. They defend the school with guns and
grenades against state troopers, parents, and
even the national guard.

Within this plot there are different issues. The
headmaster, played by George C. Scott, proclaims
that honor is the single most important facet of
life. Later, the head student, played by Timothy
Hutton, says ‘Honor doesn’t mean anything when
there is a twelve-year-old boy lying dead at your
feet.”” The movie constantly questions the role of a
solider, or even what a soldier is.

Scott mentions that all military leaders have
been depicted as crazy because ‘‘they all are a lit-
tle off balance; some a lot off balance.” There are
very few statements that don’t have another

.f r,t t

The Ring-tum Phi; March 4, 1982, Page 3

 

Timothy Hutton Plays “Taps’

character offset their statements.

George C. Scott plays his role commandingly.
Unfortunately, he is really in no more than the
first twenty minutes. His performance is good, but
there is just enough of him.

Timothy Hutton does a pretty-good job. He is
especially good in two scenes. One, a confronta-
tion with his father, and the other, when he
realizes that the national guard is about to invade
the school.

Ronny Cox plays the leader of the national
guard. He confronts all of Hutton’s hypotheses
with cynicism and realism. His performance is
good as well.

The outstanding performance comes from Sean
Penn. He plays Hutton’s roommate, and is simply
tremendous. He is not excited about the military
take-over, but justifies his remaining at the school
by telling Hutton, “I don’t walk out on a friend.”
He also comes up with the idea that Hutton should
just proclaim victory, and then put down his arms
and walk out.

The most important thing about seeing this
movie is that you must be forced to leave all reali-
ty aside. Every five minutes there is another
episode which is impossible to believe. This is a
real failing, for a movie which strives to bring
statements against things all-too-real must be
done in an unbelievable fashion.

Except for this problem in believeability, Taps
is a good film.

Cagers Snubbed By NCAA...

by G. Bruce Potter

Perhaps Dean Atwood should
coach the Washington and Lee
basketball team. Or even Pro-
fessor Handelman.

What do these two dis-
tinguished faculty members
have to do with W&L basket-
ball? Just ask head coach Verne
Canfield, whose Generals clos-
ed out their season with a 72-54
loss to Roanoke in the finals of
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference tournament that drop-
ped their record to 21-7. They
lost a second battle later in the
day when the NCAA selection
committee overlooked them as
an at-large entry for the Divi-
sion III tournament.

“I was disappointed because
the boys deserved it without a
doubt,”’ said Canfield, who
notched his fourth 20-win season
en route to claiming the ODAC’s
Coach-of-the-Year award. “It
was just a matter of politics and
economics.”

The Generals, who had a bet-
ter record than 18 of the schools
in the 32-team NCAA field,
crushed Eastern Mennonite
92-60 and Hampden-Sydney
70-59 to advance to Sunday’s
ODAC final at the Salem-
Roanoke County Civic Center.
Despite a poor shooting perfor-
mance by W&L, ranked 17th in
the latest Division III poll,
Roanoke, ranked third, only
led by three, 30-27, at halftime.

A basket by John Lee Graves,
who had nine points, gave W&L
a 35-34 lead with 15 minutes left

in the game. Moreover, over the
next six minutes, the Maroons
outscored the Generals 9-2 to
take a 45-37 advantage.

Frank Eppes, who led all
scorers with 20 points, con-
nected to cut the Roanoke lead
to six points, and W&L took
what may have been a fatal
timeout because it was at this
point that the Maroons decided
to go into their spread offense
that presented numerous pro-
blems for the Generals.

“It’s a question of quickness
and psychology,’’ said Canfield.
“It’s an awkward situation for
the defense because they are
forced to foul and hope they
miss the free throws.”’

The last thing the Maroons
did was to miss their free
throws as they hit 18 of 20 over
the last ten minutes, and most
of their baskets during that
span came on backdoor plays as
W&L was unable to match up
man-for-man. Meanwhile, the
Generals’ offensive woes con-
tinued as Roanoke rattled off
eight straight points to take a
55-41 lead at the 5:43 mark.

Other than Eppes, no
Generals scored in double
figures as they shot 37.7 percent
from the floor, a mark that in-
cluded sophomore guard Billy
Yates, normally a sixty-percent
shooter, 1-10 performance. ‘““We
just did not click on offense. In
certain situations, we tried to
create when we should have
taken more time. We had
wanted to set the tempo

because we knew we couldn’t
_run with them,” said Canfield.

Another problem that
plagued the team was turnovers
— 19 against’ Roanoke and 20
versus Hampden-Sydney on
Saturday. Despite those
mistakes, the Generals had
very little problem in disposing
of the Tigers 70-59.

The Generals opened in a 2-3
zone defense against H-SC, but
Hampden-Sydney’s Mark Kelly
scored 12 points, all from the
outside, over the first ten
minutes of the game to give his
team an 18-10 lead. But Canfield
remained confident in his
defense. ‘‘Long, outside shots
will never beat you,’’ he said.
“You must maintain poise on
the offensive end. When they
stop hitting, they will still keep
shooting, so you just need to
concentrate on boxing out.’’

... Finish Second In ODAC

by John M. Cleghorn

The first thing the Generals
had to do after the final game of
the ODAC championship Sun-
day afternoon was listen to the
announcement of the all-tourna-
ment team. Three of the five
spots chosen from the eight
team tournament went to
Roanoke players and that tells
the story for the championship
game, the tournament, and the
season in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference.

The tournament went just
about as everyone expected,
with W&L meeting Roanoke in
the final game. The Generals
beat Eastern Mennonite and
Hampden-Sydney with relative
ease, setting the stage for the
third showdown between the
first and second-seeded teams
in the conference.

In many ways the tournament
games for the Generals were a
capsule of their season. After
beating Eastern Mennonite
twice in the regular season the
opening round on Thursday
night turned out to be an exhibi-
tion for the Generals. A 15-point
lead through most of the second

half gave some of ine players a
chance to show their abilities
outside the normal rigid of-
fense. The ear-to-ear grin on
Bill Yates’ face as he sat on the

bench and watched freshmen -

and reserves play out the clock
expressed the anticipation. of
the second round.

The Salem-Roanoke Civic
Center is built to hold 3500 peo-

ple. In the first round of the
semi-finals only 178 fans show-
ed up to watch the game be-
tween W&L and Hampden-
Sydney which showed another
aspect of the Generals’ play.

For the first 13 minutes W&L
sputtered, not playing the
smooth control game that
brought them many of its
regular season wins. But a
large part of their success is the
fact that they are smart ball
players and are adapt. Towards
the end of the first half and
throughout the second the
Generals settled down and took
the reins. Except for a last
minute flurry in which the
Tigers pulled within five, the
victory was clearly W&L’s.

the third W&L Roanoke game. —

Roanoke had slammed-dunked
its way there and W&L had
finessed its way there. “

From their first possession
the Generals played their slow
deliberate offense. The
Maroons came out running but
the play later slowed to a
smarter zone game. The half-
time score had Roanoke up by
one,

Four minutes into the second
half, the factors the Generals
couldn’t do anything about,
Roanoke’s superior size and
depth, came into play. A one
point lead went to three, to
eight, and to 10. There were no
Unknown Fans or Warner
Center crowds to intervene and
the Generals went down
fighting.

To win 21 games, tie for the
conference title, and lose to a
team ranked third in the coun-
try in the tournament finals is a
pretty good year. To do so ina
transition year is something
else. And the best part is that
we only lose two seniors.

Is that enough to call next
year a tran.‘tion year? ,

Wood’s Four Goals Lead Generals Over Duke

by Doug Teague

Geoff Wood scored four goals
as the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team downed Duke
12-6 in a season-opening victory
Tuesday in Durham, NC.

The host Blue Devils opened
the scoring about two minutes
into the game, but W&L re-
bounded with goals by tri-
captain Rob Staugaitis and
Wood. The first period ended at
2-2, but the Generals scored
three unanswered goals in the
second stanza and opened up

Staugaitis lead the team in

his first quarter goal. The
Generals had a total of 41 shots

Lukes, a sophomore, was in the

and made seven stops.

Head Coach Jack Emmer

was pleased with the offensive
performance of the attack. The
midfield was solid also as San-
cilio won the ‘Cannon Awerd”’
for the outstanding player of the
game. Emmer expressed en-

thusiasm over Rich Schoen-

face-off man, the freshman won

has switched from attack this
year, had a good day in his new
role. Assistant Coach Eric
Kemp said that the defensemen
were working well together and
will continue to improve in the
concept of team defense.

Emmer and the squad had
been concerned going into Tues-
day’s game becuase they hadn’t
practiced for three days prior to
the contest due to bad weather.

In addition, a practice session
held before the game was slop-
py. Emmer realized that there
were some areas that needed to
be worked on. “We had a steady
performance but spotty execu-

The weather was not kind to
the fencing team this season.
Although the club had originally

been scheduled to fence eight
teams in addition to the six
teams fencing in the Virginia
Cup, five of these meets were
cancelled due to poor driving
conditions.

When the team did fence, it
fenced well—considering _ its
club status. The team beat the
Citadel’s varsity squad, but lost
to Navy and VMI. The 14-13 loss
to VMI was the toughest loss for
the team. According to team
coach Tad Humphreys, “W&L
should have beaten us.”

Individually W&L had some
outstanding fencers. Pat Berg
finished fourth in the state com-
petition, and Freshman Tom
Stewert finished the season with
a 7-2 record. According to cap-
tian Dave Hepler, ‘‘Tom has the
potential to be a really good
fencer. Finishing 7-2 in your
fisrt season is excellent.’’

As usual, graduaution will
take its toll on the team. Among
the missing next year will be
former state champion and cur-
rent captian Hepler, and the
team’s number two. sabre
fencer Clyde Harkrader.

Jack Emmer, Lacrosse Coach

Canfield, Four Generals

Honored In ODAC

Washington and Lee heaa
basketball coach Verne Can-
field and standout performers
Brian Hanson and George
Spears received honors during
the week of February 22 from
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

Canfield, who completed his
18th-year as Generals’ director,
was named the league’s Coach-
of-the-Year. He guided W&L to
a 21-7 record, a runner-up finish
in the 0.D.A.C. Championship
Tournament, and to a 17th spot
in the NCAA Division III na-
tional rankings for the week of
February 25. The award is his
second in the league’s six-year
history, the first coming in 1977
when he led W&L to a 23-5
record and the first of three
O.D.A.C. titles. His overall
W&L record stands at 293-167, a
winning mark of 63.6 percent,
and includes four twenty-win
seasons.

Hanson, a junior forward
from Rockville, Md., received
first-team All-Conference
recognition. A starter in all 28
games this winter, he compiled
a 13.0 scoring average and a 7.2
rebounding average, connec-
ting on 50.5 percent of his field
goals and on 81.6 percent of his
free throws. He led the team in
scoring on ten occasions and in
rebounding 11 times.

Spears, a senior guard from
Annandale, Va., was selected to
the All-Conference second
team. A starter in 27 games this
season, he finished with an 11.2 .
scoring average and 82 assists.
He was successful on 51.2 per-
cent of his field goals, and 84.3
percent of his free throws.

W&L players also earned two
of the eight honorable-mention
All-Conference awards: junior
center Frank Eppes (Green-
ville, S.C.) and sophomore for-
ward John Lee Graves
(Virginia Beach, Va.).

Averett Vie

by Todd Smith

and Ben Jarratt
_ Presidential candidates Jim
Averett and Bennett Ross
squared off Wednesday after-
noon about the role of debate
and the student body funding of
spiritual groups, but the discus-
sion centered on qualifications
at the candidateforum. .

Peter Collins, the third can-
didate for the student body
president position, did not at-
tend the forum because of class.

Asked to evaluate his perfor-
mance on the Executive Com-
mittee as Vice President,
Averett responded that. it had
been a learning year for him.
He also pointed to his ex-
perience on a number of other
bodies.

“T remember on the Student
Control Committee, (as presi-
dent) I was the one who did all
the work and preparation,” said
Averett..

“And I’ve looked on this year
in the beginning as assimilating
a lot of new material as far.as
honor-related matters. It’s one
thing to have the White Book

memorized, it’s another to have
a working knowledge of the
honor system.”

E.C. Secretary Bennett Ross
answered that, “I think I was
able to pull myself away from
the minutes and say some-
thing.” ;

“The secretary is not some-

one elected just to write. He’s a
voice on this committee...and
that’s how he should spend his
time, and still be responsible for
putting out reliable and respon-
sible lists of what goes on in
these meetings.”
- Ross also noted his respon-
sibility to serve on subcom-
mittees, and said that he had
worked on the Centel Telephone
Co-op subcommittee and a com-
mittee that examined ways to
comply with the student body
vote on constitutional ammend-
‘ments.

Averett said that meetings
were running “‘way too long,”
and that the meeting he chaired
last week in the absense of
President Eric Myers was ‘‘one
of the smoother meetings we
had all year.”

the comment Jim made that the
discussion was sometimes
cyclical. We’re not a debating
society, that’s true, but the
discussion that we have allows
us to hash out issues as far as
twelve different members’ per-
spectives on one issue...coming
to a similar way of looking at
something.”’

In explaining his qualifica-
tions, Averett mentioned that
he had worked with President
Huntley and students, like Bill
Archer, to secure university

‘money for the. Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship after the
group’s budget reqest was re-
jected by the E.C. :

The Honor System

Citing a possible problem in
the student-run, single-sanction
honor system, Averett noted,
“It is called (an honor) hearing,

‘but in some ways, it’s not a
hearing. It’s more of a trial, and
I think ways need to be looked
into to see how it can be improv-
ed.”’

“T think our procedures, most
of all the single sanction, are
our most viable working parts
of the honorsystem. I’ve talked

ce
ser
eee
yea

for President at

to Sam Allen extensively, who is
one of the students who has
worked a great deal with the
Executive Committee, and I’ve
seen some problems that could
arise in the future,” said
Averett.

Despite questions from Ben

Hale (’84 Rep.) and Myers,.

Averett said it would be “‘an in-
justice’”’ to make proposals
“from the hip.” He recom-
mended more study.

Ross agreed that the single
sanction was the ‘most impor-
tant characteristic of our honor
system.”’ He praised White
Book revisions made last spring
and said that everything had
run smoothly this year because
of those changes.

Ross recommended that
questionaires be filled out by
students participating in honor
hearings so that the E.C. could
learn from each trial. Other
than establishing this program
of ‘following up,” Ross had no
major changes in mind for the
Honor System.

“I cannot fathom someone
coming in to chair an honor
hearing, never having seen an

honor hearing,”’ said Ross, in
reference seemingly to Peter
Collins, who contends for the
job of president without having
served as an E.C. represen-
tative. .

“It’s an extremely difficult
system,” said Ross.

Separation of Powers.

Leonard Howard asked the
two presidential candidates to
comment on .the possibility of
dividing the legislative part of
student government from the
judicial side.

“You’ve got to integrate the
honor system with other goings-
on around campus,” said
Averett. ‘In that way I feel you
should not separate the
legislative from the judicial
aspects.’

“I think that a school or our
size doesn’t require two dif-
ferent, distinct student body
governments,” said Ross. “I
can forsee problems insofar as
the role of a separate honor
body. Their whole role would be
enshrouded in secrecy.”’

Ross said that the the publici-
ty of the legislative side enhanc-
ed accountability on the secret,

Myers Questions Averett

Myers asked Averett at the
end of the forum why he had
missed over a third of the
meetings of the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee. Myers
noted that Averett was given
the position of ad hoc member
of Dean Eward Atwood’s
powerful committee because of
his office of Vice President.

“Thank you very much for
asking that, Eric,” replied
Averett. “They didn’t schedule
the meetings around my
classes.” -

Averett said that he was in
class at those times when he
was absent.

Myers then said that other
committees have made special

arrangements for the E.C., |

such as the University Council,
which has rescheduled some
meetings to fit Myers’ schedule.

‘T’m sorry, but that’s not
what they did with me,” said
_*verett. Averett later smiled
and called it a “‘hose-question.”

Platforms

Averett rests his campaign on

his experience as head of the

Student Control Committee and
on his contacts with alumni, ad-
ministrators and law students.

“All these committees have
given me a good, a better-than-
average view of issues on cam-
pus. I think that is a very impor-
tant aspect when you assume
the presidency where you are
dealing with faculty ad-
ministrators, deans, board
members — and you are work-
ing with these people on a day-
to-day basis.”’

Ross stresses his record of ef-
ficient note-taking and his con-
tributions to debate.

“I think the only real ex-
perience which is probably ap-
plicable to the job of president
is the actual experience on the
Executive Committee. I think
being secretary this year, you
are more keenly attuned to
some of the smaller details of
what the committee does as far
as the preparations for honor
hearings.

“T’ve been able to work close-
ly this year with Eric in that
capacity and developed a sense
of what the job is basically
about,”’ said Ross.

by Todd Smith
and Ben Jarratt
Although Mike Singer is the
only candidate for Secretary of
the E.C. on the ballot for Mon-
day, he had to tangle with Pete
Baumgaertner yesterday in a
candidates’ forum yesterday.

Baumgaertner is running a
write-in campaign based on his
experience as a sophomore E.C.
representative. Singer’s ex-
perience with government
comes from serving as head of
this year’s Voting Regulations
Board.

Asked to describe his creden-
tials, Singer said, “‘When you
mention the job of secretary of
the E.C., you have to think of
hard work and dedication cause
that’s what the job is all about.’’
Singer noted that he had sat in

Informal Collins for

by Todd Smith

Peter Collins missed the
Forum Wednesday afternoon
because of class, but the per-
sonal interview of him that the
Phi conducted afterwards was
more in keeping with his style
anyway.

“I want to keep this infor-
mal,” Collins said.

Indeed, Collins was at pains
to come across as “relaxed, but
definitely concerned. I will
listen to everything the students
have to say. OBJECTIVITY,
that’s the word.”

Collins has no E.C. ex-
perience but has served on Stu-
dent Control. He is graduating
next year after only three years
at Washington and Lee.

“TI think there’s too much of a
mystique about the job of
presidency. I think the _presi-
dent has to be someone that the
people can associate with, and I
think its the purpose of the
president to bring the E.C.

The Ring-tum Phi, March 4, 1982, Page 7

 

on student control hearings as
vice president of his class, and
that he has served on the
univeristy Council.

Explaining his work with the
VRB, Singer said, “Three am-
mendments passed and there
were enough people that voted
this year, whereas that has
always been a problem in the
past, and I think that says
something about dedication,
because I worked very hard on
that.”

Baumgaertner said that he
served as liason member to the
VRB when he was on the E.C.
“With the VRB, we made up a
set of proposals and recommen-
dations to the E.C. last spring,
and many of those proposals
came to fruition....’’

He noted that his work with
the Mock Convention subcom-
mittee led to putting funds in

down to the students level.”’

Collins said that he was con-
cerned about a feeling he saw
among students that the E.C.
was a collection of “stuffed
shirts.”’

“It just takes preparation,
and it takes the confidence and
support of the rest of the
members,’’ said Collins.

Collins said that he had talked
to past presidents of the E.C.
and he believed that he could be
prepared for the job with mock
honor hearings and tutoring.

Asked the same questions
about the honor system as those
candidates at the forum, Collins
agreed that the single sanction
is essential to the honor system.

About the possibility of ad-
ding two extra members, and
idea which Ross and Averett
feel was properly handled when
rejected by the E.C. earlier,
Collins said, ‘‘I would like to see
the present elections process
explore. There is the possibility
of choosing both the law school

Baumgaertner, Singer forSec’y

money market accounts. “‘I feel
I have the organizational abili-
ty, which is pretty much in-
herent in my academic stan-
ding and in my other commit-
tees which I have worked on,
Specifically the Who’s Who
committee....”’ ;

Baumgaertner also spoke of
his ‘good rapport with the
faculty.”’ _

When asked about improving
the honor system, Baumgaert-
ner noted that he had long
fought for the revising of a
sentence which he felt scared
away good, honest students.

Singer said that student
awareness of the honor system
was very low, so low that
students voted to retain the
position of treasurer on the E.C.
when there has been none for
years. .

Prez

representatives at large so that
they would both be on the E.C.
when the year began.”

“I'd like to look into the
possibility of a freshman trip to
Natural Bridge again. We need
some type of experience where
the freshman becomes _ ac-
quainted with the honor system.
I think its unfair to ask the
freshmen to ‘live and learn’’’

Collins proposes to strengthen
the guidance counseling system
here, modeling the career
placement of lawyers on the
way the chemistry department
places future doctors, with
availible information about
graduate studies and jobs
available all four years.

Collins proposes to improve
the ‘‘town-gown’’ relationship.
He would like to see noise viola-
tions reduced as well as any
animosity, he said.

“T just want everybody to be
happy, for everyone to get
along,” said Collins.

In College Survey, W&L Rated Average

Students at Washington and
Lee often take pride in pointing
out the difficulties of the school.
The rigors of a liberal arts
education, they say, make this
one of the more demanding
schools in the South, if not inthe
nation.

A study conducted by the New
York Times disputes this state-
ment, however. In a survey of
265 of the leading colleges in the
nation, The Times concludes in
its ‘‘Selective Guide to Colleges,
1982-83,” that Washington and
Lee is only average, nationally,
in terms of academics, social
life and quality of living.
Schools were graded on a
numerical scale with an ideal
score of five for each category.

In making the guide, Edward
B. Fiske, Education Editor of
the New York Times, and a
staff of over 250 researchers
collected information from col-
lege administrators, admis-
sions officers and leaders of col-
lege student bodies. In choosing
only 265 of the more than 2000
four-year colleges in the United
States, the Times looked for
schools that had ‘‘special
popularity at the present.”’

The question that most ob-
viously comes to mind is where
does W&L rank with the rest of
the country? If we are to guess
that all colleges that receive the
same ‘‘triple three” ratings as
W&L fall in the same category,
then here are a few of what the
Times feels are our equals.
Keep in mind that these are all

schools that scored ‘“‘triple
three’ ratings.

How The Girls’ Schools Fared

HOLLINS COLLEGE

How does this small all-
women’s college in the wilds of
the Blue Ridge Mountains keep
its student body so contented?
Hollins women can expect all
the attention and respect they
want from an administration
that is ‘‘definitely committed to
the education of its students.”
There is enough academic em-
phasis to keep ‘determined,
ambitious women’’ busy, but lit-
tle enough pressure so that
“when a party comes up,
homework is forgotten.”’

The school’s academic pro-
gram is typical of a small
liberal-arts college. The best
departments are English, par-
ticularly creative writing, and
psychology, each with a na-

RANDOLPH-MACON
WOMAN’S COLLEGE
Whatever you do, do not say,
suggest, or imply to a
Randolph-Macon Woman’s Col-
lege student that her school is a
finishing school. The members
of this close-knit college com-
munity are extremely proud of
their academic tradition and
are tired of battling the
finishing-school misnomer that
persistently raises its ugly
head. “‘R-MWC’s every bit as
good as Smith or Wellesley,”
asserts one student, ‘‘and I’d
like to see it get some credit.”
She is, of course, overstating
the situation considerably, but
the defensiveness is understan-
dable. Randolph-Macon was the
first Southern women’s college

SWEET BRIAR COLLEGE

You just can’t rely on
anything anymore — not even
on Sweet Briar College, that
elegent finishing school where
young Scarlett O’Haras once
perfected their antebellum-
style charm. The stereotype of
“white gloves and snobby
Southern girls” is crumbling as
surely as the walls of Jericho
amidst the college’s new
slogan: ‘‘An education for reali-
ty.” As one biology major
demands, ‘‘How can people in
their right minds believe that
Sweet Briar is a Southern
finishing school in this day and
age? Get REAL!”

Unlike other revitalized
women’s schools, Sweet Briar is
not gung ho about professional

W&L: Surrendering To The

WASHINGTON AND LEE °

This institution, founded in
the mid-eighteenth century, has
finally followed the example of
its mid-nineteenth-century
president, Robert E. Lee, and
surrendered — not to the Union,
but to the twentieth century. No
longer a finishing school for
sons of the Southern
aristocracy, W&L imports
almost half its student body
from up North. A standard
liberal-arts program remains
the foundation of the cur-
riculum, but there are also ex-
cellent preprofessional pro-
grams that send large numbers
of graduates to top medical,
law, and business schools.
Although certain traditional
aspects of the school, like the
stately brick and white-column
buildings, still preserve the at-
mosphere of the Old South, the

only real throwback to the days
of Lee is the all-male student
body. '
Washington and Lee has
maintained its outstanding
departments in history and
English, and added _inter-
disciplinary Russian and East
Asian studies, the latter
enhanced by new ties with the
National University of Taiwan.
The school’s growing preprofes-
sional emphasis is reflected in
its popular School of Com-
merce, Economics, and
Politics, the journalism major,
and science departments,
although math and physics are
considered weak. The excellent
placement record for its
graduates testifies to the quali-
ty instruction in these areas.
Complementing this vocational
emphasis is an_ inter-
disciplinary program in Socie-

ty, Ethics, and the Professions.
The distribution require-
ments in liberal arts have
recently been toned down and
are no longer considered ‘‘undu-
ly rigorous.”’ Anyone aiming for
more than the gentleman’s C,
though, will find the workload
stiff. ‘“Guts are simply not to be
found,’’ warns one senior. “If
any course garners that reputa-
tion, the department im-
mediately remedies the situa-
tion.’’ Only three courses can be
taken pass-fail during a stu-
dent’s four years. Despite stiff
grading, the rapport between
students and teachers is ex-
cellent. It is not unusual for a
professor to have a group of
students over for dinner and
“even the lowliest freshmen’”’
have access to _ faculty
members. This level of respect
and friendliness is a result not

Twentieth

only of the school’s small size,
but also of the student-
administered honor system
— “a smash hit” at W&L. Test
and final exams are taken
without any faculty supervi-
sion; doors remain unlocked,
calculators untended, and
library stacks open twenty-four
hours a day. The only punish-
ment for violation, one meted
out several times a year, is im-
mediate expulsion.

The school has diversified its
curriculum by offering more in-
ternships, studies abroad, and
close-to-home study through the
Seven-College Exchange. The
school ends the year with a six-
week term offering student-
organized seminars, indepen-
dent study, and department
trips abroad. The new library’s
facilities are superb, boasting
800 individual study areas as

In the immediate area, the
University of Virginia was the
big winner. U.Va. was given the
highest possible ratings for both

.academic standards and quali-
ty of living. Ironically, U.Va., a
school notorious for partying,
did not receive a perfect score
for social life.

Two North Carolina schools,
Duke and North Carolina, also
received high marks. U.N.C.
received a perfect score for
academics and near-perfect
marks for quality of living and
social life. Duke scored “‘fours”’
in all three categories.

Overall, Virginia and North
Carolina received higher marks
than Harvard, which received a
“five” for academics, but only

three for social life and four for ‘

quality of living.

If W&L was disappointed by
‘its scores, then the local girls’
schools had to be somewhat
satisfied. Randolph-Macon and
Sweet Briar were given
“threes” for academics while
Hollins was saddled with a two.
The girls’ schools made a com-
eback in quality of living, with
Sweet Briar and Hollins getting
better ratings than W&L. Both
Macon and Sweet Briar rated
below W&L in social life.

well as private rooms for
honors students.

Conservatis.., is as much a
part of the twentieth century as
of the nineteenth and the stu-
dent body at Washington and
Lee is no exception. One student
writes bluntly that ‘people who
do not like Southern preppies
and fairly rich, elitist people”
should not come to W&L.
Minorities are in for a par-
ticularly rough time, and only
recently, says the admissions
director, have they been enroll-
ed “in significant numbers.”
Blacks now number less than 2
percent of the student body. The
school’s new-found geographic
diversity has not prompted
much other differentiation, and
pink button-downs, khakis, and
penny loafers remain the cam-
pus uniform. Public-school

What The New York Times Had To Say About W&L

W&L:

: (continued from page 8)
graduates (about 55 percent of
the students) soon succumb to
the pressure to conform and
“‘turn preppie.’’ Never prone to
false modesty, the W&L man
considers himself ‘‘better-
looking, more intelligent, more
outgoing, and more self-
confident than the average
male.”

Students spend their first
year living comfortably in dor-
mitory singles and eating well
in Evans Dining Hall. The good
food is ‘another plus for
neurotic mommies,’”’ says one
student, who confesses to hav-
ing put on twenty pounds. After
freshman year, most students
bypass the small upperclass
dorm and move either to frater-
nities or off campus. The in-
town apartments, or farm-
houses in the country, are large,
inexpensive, and a nice escape
from campus life. Bumping
against the foothills of the
beautiful Blue Ridge moun-
tains, the school provides an
abundance of activities for
nature lovers, including hun-
ting, fishing, camping, and tub-
ing in the rivers. Washington,
Richmond, and ski slopes are
easily reached by car for
weekend trips. On campus, a
thriving intramural program

 

brings fraternities and in--

dependents together in friendly
rivalry. Football sparks some
interest in the fall, but W&L
students “live for the spring
and lacrosse.” Continual con-
tenders for national champion-
ships, the team holds the cam-

pus in thrall from March to
June.

Ringed by five women’s col-
leges within an hour’s drive,
there is enough weekend
socializing at W&L to make up
for the long hours in the library.
Social life focuses on several
big weekends a term including
an outrageously expensive Fan- —
cy Dress Weekend that lures
women from all over the wires
east and Southeast. But special
events or no, hundreds of -
women make the trip to W&L
every week for fraternity par-
ties, school-run mixers, and the
“Cockpit,” the school’s pub.

The school’s seventeen frater-
nities are still the movers and
shakers of the W&L social
scene, each hosting parties
almost every weekend. About
two-thirds of the students go
Greek and those who don’t are
urged to share the social life by
“at least hanging out at one.”
Despite Virginia’s minimum
drinking age of 21 for every-
thing except beer, liquor and
grain punch are staples of the
W&L diet. “Many of the
students have been weaned on
Bloody Marys at their local
country club,’’ observes one
student; few break the habit
here.

Despite the number of eager
and eligible young women

descending on Lexington each

weekend, students continually
cite the all-male environment
as the school’s biggest
drawback. “Single-sex, ugh,’
declares one student. Maybe
the time has come for

Washington and Lee to sur- |

render again.

training, career internships,
and the like. Rather it remains
committed to a quality liberal-
arts education that makes far
more than token demands on its
young women. ‘“‘It’s hard to fail
but even harder to do very
well,” is how one student
describes it. The new distribu-
tion requirements, while not
always appreciated, assure ex-
posure to a foreign language,
English, phys ed, math, a lab
science, and nonwestern
civilization. Students give
special praise to the art history,
English, and mathematics
departments, but few areas are
really weak. Sciences are
perhaps best approached wari-
ly; not one of the 1980 graduates

special business sequence can
be taken leading to an MBA in

tionally known faculty member
and the school’s only graduate

programs. Students also recom-

mend French, history, philos-
ophy, and art. Like many other
schools, Hollins has introduced
the popular January term for
travel, internships, or special
on-campus academic projects.
The library is not terribly good,
but those at nearby Virginia
Polytechnic Institute or
Roanoke College can always: be
used. Although stressing a
liberal-arts curriculum, Hollins
has made some concessions to
the career-oriented, including
new programs in computer
science and statistics and a
greater emphasis on business in
the economics department. It
also offers combined-degree
programs in engineering, ar-
chitecture, and nursing at
Virginia Tech or the University
of Virginia. More imaginative
students may design their own
course of study.

Academic pressure is kept to
a minimum, even during ex-
amination week, and the
student-administered Indepen-
dent Exam System allows each
student to take tests at her con-
venience and without supervi-
sion. Nevertheless, most seem

 

to take their studies seriously,
and partying during the week is
not common.

Many students take a visiting
semester at another college.
Programs include studying in-
ternational relations at Drew
University in New Jersey and
political science at American
University in Washington.
Others take advantage of the
Seven-College Exchange or
Hollins’ programs in Paris and
London, both featuring living
with families there.

Though the 1980s breed of
Hollins. student may be more
“mellow and relaxed,’ the
typical student is still what she
has always been: white, upper-
middle-class, and Southern
preppie. More than half of them
graduate from private schools.
The school has a national stu-
dent body — only a quarter
comes from Virginia. Almost
half the students ranked in the
bottom three-fifths of their high
school classes, but everyone is
quick to discount any finishing-
school taint. Administrators
point out that manv students
come from highly competitive
private schools As applications
increase, admissions criteria
are rising, and, says one stu-
dent, “Hollins has no qualms
about asking students to
withdraw for grades.”’

The school takes full advan-
tage of the beautiful Shenan-
doah Valley and Blue Ridge

Mountains by organizing hikes,

canoe and raft trips, bike hikes,
spelunking, and rock climbing.
At the annual Tinker Day
festivities, sometime after the
first frost of autumn, classes
are canceled in the morning and
the whole school hikes to the top
of Tinker Mountain for picnics,
songs, and skits. There is also a
forty-horse stable on campus
and an extensive riding pro-
gram. There are no _ in-
tramurals, and the tiny gym

and pool are desperately in_

need of the planned addition.

sive males are forty miles north

itself shuns sororities but does
organize school-wide mixers.
Road trips are made each
weekend, but about half the stu-
dent body stays on campus to
make their own fun. For male
friends visiting Hollirts,*there is
a ‘men’s dorm” in which the
guest may room for a small fee.

Hollins is a college where
everyone “radiates with
friendliness.’’ “Hollie Collies’’
face little pressure either to

ly, but the opportunities for both

room for their “tapes and

unsettles the ‘“‘Rose Thorns”’

sent the drunken bashes being
held on their turf. Thus a typical
weekend is spent “‘either away

to qualify for a Phi Beta Kappa
chapter, and it prides itself on
its ability to educate each stu-
dent “‘in the singular.” Pro-
fessors take a personal interest
in their students, as do the
president and other top ad-
ministrators.

This community feeling and
mutual trust allow students a
great deal of autonomy. Instead
of enforcing formal distribution
requirements, the college relies
on optional guidelines and the
tailoring of individual pro-
grams by a faculty adviser.
When it comes time to declare a
major, a student can choose
either traditional departments
or interdisciplinary majors
such as communication, inter-
national relations, or Asian
Studies or, if none of these are to
her liking, design her own.
Students work under an all-
encompassing, student-
regulated honor system that in-
cludes self-scheduled exams.
They may also take advantage
of Randolph-Macon’s participa-
tion in the Seven-College Ex-
change to experience another
campus for a year or semester.
The college also offers a junior
year abroad at the University of
Reading in England and a joint
engineering program with
Vanderbilt. Students can easily
arrange for special internships,
independent study, or study
abroad through another school.

The school’s small size has its

Students lovingly nurture
SBC’s traditions — lantern
bearing, step singing, and the
fight for the senior stairs seem
to be especially prized — and
appreciate the genteel image
that clings to Sweet Briar and
its graduates. “Talk with an
alum,” one senior advises.
“She'll probably be polite and
well-groomed, and_ she’ll
definitely be intelligent.” In
short, Sweet Briar has found a
way to pursue the goals of the
eighties without shedding the
trappings of a finishing-school
education. ‘Yes, the campus
does look like a country club,’’
admits one student, “‘but who
said learning had to be unplea-
sant?”

disadvantages. The library’s
stocks are not always adequate
for intensive research projects,
and it closes at 11 p.m. Nor are
course offerings as abundant or
varied as at a larger school.
Most students, however, con-
sider these limitations a modest
price to pay for the highly
responsive and engaging
academic-setting.

Randolph-Macon women are
enrolled from more than forty
states and a dozen foreign coun-
tries, and the majority come
from public schools. Never-
theless, there are enough
Southern prep_ school
graduates, and they are visible
enough to give the college what
some call a ‘‘Southern-belleish”’
tone. The school, says one stu-
dent, is ‘‘a civilized academic
institution for women who ap-
preciate the finer qualities of
life,” in which she includes
afternoon teas. After all,
R-MWC stands for Respected
Mature Women with Class, or
so the saying goes.

Admission depends largely on
high school grades and class
rank. Doing well on your SATs
will not make up for an un-
satisfactory record because,
says the admissions director,
“high scores are not tickets of
admission if grades don’t
match.’’ Randolph-Macon
wants women who are “highly
academically motivated” and
ready to work; “whether you
come with motivation or it is in-
stilled here, you must really
study and push to keep up.”’

REVIEW aud OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

 

On Being Average

The New York Times’ Selective Guide to Colleges
leaves some interesting question’ about the status of
Washington and Lee University. In composing the
guide, the Times selected 265 schools out of the more

_ than 2,000 such four-year colleges in the nation. While
W&L was honored to be in this group, it received
marks that were not so impressive.

The Times’ write-up of W&L was very complimen-
tary. The article praised the school’s transition to pro-
fessional programs and said that W&L has fared well
in terms of job placement. However, the Times con-
cluded that W&L is only average — and that hurts.

Washington and Lee is not the cheapest college
around. After four years at W&L, the bills total
somewhere around $25,000. When this is considered, it
hurts to think that we’re attending only an average
college.

Surveys of W&L freshmen classes always indicate
that the W&L man considers himself better than the
average person. Perhaps this feeling of superiority,
coupled with the general elan created by excessive
minkism, is why the Times rating hurts.

Washington and Lee is certainly a cut above the or-
dinary. Unfortunately, the New York Times did not
reach the same conclusion. If the average W&L man
feels that he is superior, perhaps it is time to put that
sentiment to constructive use. We have convinced
each other that we are a good school. Perhaps it is
time to show the outside world that we really are bet-
ter than average.

Big Three Petitions Filed

by Ben Jarratt

Five students submitted peti-
tions to run for the Big Three
positions on the Executive Com-
mittee Monday night. The elec-
tion will be held Monday, March
8.

The race for the presidential
seat attracted three students.
The presidential candidates
are:

-Jim Averett, E.C. Vice
President and a junior politics
major from Atlanta, Ga. ;

--Peter Collins, president of
the sophomore class and a
Geology/English major from
Dallas, Tx.;

--Bennett Ross, E.C.
Secretary and a junior business
administration major from
Huntington, W.Va.

Morgan Griffith, second-year
law student from Salem, Va.,
will run unopposed for the vice
president position. Mike Singer,
a sophomore politics major
from Dallas, Tx., is running
unopposed for the secretary
seat. |

Warren Snead was nominated
as Voting Regulations Board
chairman to replace Singer,
who resigned as_ chairman
because of the elections. There
will be three polling booths on
the undergraduate campus
—one at the library, one at the
Co-op and one in the Freshman
Quad. Another booth will be at
the law school.

The E.C. set a $10 spending
limit for the candidates. One
banner and 15 posters will be
allowed on the university at one
time, with unlimited posters
allowed off-campus.

In other matters, E.C. Presi-
dent Eric Myers said the E.C.

should reflect the opinions of
the student body concerning the
selection of a new university
president. The E.C. debated
several ways of soliciting
responses from the student
body.
Ross motioned that the com-
mittee draw up a set of criteria
for use in selecting a new presi-
dent. Also, the E.C. would set up
suggestion boxes across cam-
pus to solicit student responses,
as well as contact Dean Watt
about the feasibility of a student
questionnaire on the subject.
The motion passed 10-1.
Averett opposed and Tripp
Brower, ’82 Rep., was absent.
Griffith brought up the issue
of having a student represen-
tative on the presidential selec-
tion committee. This would
allow for the students to be
heard in the selection process.
“The Board of Trustees has
already discussed and acted on
this matter,’’ replied Myers.
The board used a standard
selection format of faculty, ac
ministration and board
representatives. No students or
alumni were included.
“There is an entire aspect of

_ student life the trustees are

totally out of touch with,”
stated Tom Booher, First-year
Law Rep. ‘‘What is more impor-
tant to the students than the
selection of a new president?”’

John Vhaloplus, ’83 Rep.,
replied that the trustees had
already decided the issue.
“This is an arrogant and
useless thing to do.”’

“Our student government is
well-respected by the Board of
Trustees,’’ stated Ben Hale, ’84
Rep. ‘In order to maintain our

effectiveness on important
issues, we should let this issue
lay.”

Griffith proposed that the
E.C. write a letter to the board
suggesting a student represen-
tative be considered in any
future selection process. The
motion passed 6-5, with Myers,
Hale, Vlahoplus, Ted Mc-
Quiston, ’84 Rep., and Cole
Dawson, Freshman Rep., op-
posed.

Myers asked the committee
to respond to a recent Ring-tum
Phi critiq e of the E.C. He had
the impre. sion that ‘‘maybe the
E.C. wasn't doing enough.”’

‘“‘We can’t think of
everything,” responded Grif-
fith. “Students should be en-
couraged to attend E.C.
meetings.”

The idea of a ‘‘Gripe Session’”’
was also brought up. The E.C.
held one last year, but no
students showed up to voice
their complaints.

‘“‘We have one every Monday
night,” replied Hale. ‘One of
our main purposes is to be here.
We have to depend on our con-
stituents to come to us with
issues.”’

Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., motioned
that the E.C. take out an ad in
the Phi advertising ‘‘Gripe Ses-
sions’ every Monday night at
6:30. Lang suggested this may
generate some student interest
in regular E.C. meetings. The
motion passed 10-1, with
Averett opposing.

Myers announced the regular
E.C. elections will be held on
March 22. Petitions are due in
the E.C. office on March 15.
Elections in the law school will
be held March 29.

If They Could See Us Now

 

 

SSS i >~__ i S>>S|EES=S=S=S=S>pEpEIho ii ===

As money is spent in handfuls this week, som
bizarre thoughts come to mind.

We commence Fancy Dress not long after the
250th anniversary of George Washington’s birth
— an occasion given moderate attention national-
ly (his birthday was officially observed one week
earlier, to show you how dumb Congress is).

Washington, you know, gave Liberty Hall shares
of stock worth $50,000 in 1796, the last full year of
his presidency. That gift was enormous for those
times and was the largest ever given to a private
educational institution in the country. Were it not
for the gift the school probably wouldn’t be here,
soit was rightly named to honor George before the
nation’s capitol was.

When he transferred the James River Canal
Company stock to Lexington, Washington wrote
something about promoting literature and the arts
“in this rising Empire...”

The use of Empire with a capital “E’’ in
reference to our red, white and blue ‘‘Democracy”’
says something about Washington. He brought an
Imperial air to the office which some — including
his secretary of state, Thomas Jefferson — con-
sidered gauche and inappropriate. T.J., in fact,
despised the grand balls or levees thrown by
George and Martha in their New York mansion.

Americans generally like this kind of thing
—especially when they can afford it. And while
many obviously don’t get off on Ronnie and Nan-
cy’s glitzy hob-nobs, some people do. No one here
has sallied forth to condemn such a display of
opulence, or even decadence, in these economical-
ly troubled times.

So anyhow — perhaps Fancy Dress — par-
ticularly the ball — can be attributed in a round-
about manner to a man who never even slept here
(Natural Bridge doesn’t count). That is to say,
Washington saved our school and made formal
entertaining officially 0.K.

Of course, neither Washington nor Robert E.
Lee, who left a more tangible legacy to the school,
lived to see the dawn of the Fancy Dress Era. God
knows if they could see what goes on now, both of
them — especially the Confederave Saint — would
spin in their respective crypts.

Washington loved dance and drink and Lee en-
joyed cutting rugs in his youth, but his ideas on
alcohol may be plainly read over in Warner Center
(ironically where intoxicated FDers will stroll),
hung on the wall to strengthen the fiber of athletes
on training rules.

If the General could return and mount Traveller
for a tour of Lexington Friday night he would be
initially shocked, then repulsed and ultimately
horrified at some of the goings-on — discreet and
otherwise. It would be difficult for him to com-
prehend such behavior and he would probably con-
clude that chivalry is dead and that his school is
not in the business of turning out gentlemen
anymore.

Times have changed since Lee expired just a
few yards from where we buy supplies and munch
BLTs. We are the gentlemen of today, as any
subscriber to Gentlemen’s Quarterly will tell you.
Lee’s definition of the term was rooted in values,
not a dress code.
 

FD: Nostalgia

Nostalgia is chic and memory
speaks: Fancy Dress Ball, 1942.

To this New England college
girl in the years just before
World War II there were three
events of prime social
significance. Dartmouth Car-
nival, The Harvard-Yale game
and Washington and Lee Fancy
Dress Ball. Although I didn’t
know where or what Washing-
ton and Lee was, I had certainly
heard of its Ball. I succeeded in

excuse that they must practice
for the figure which opened the
Ball.

At nine-thirty the doors of the
old gym were locked against all
late arrivals and the fanfare
began with an intricate figure.
The ladies in long, full white
dresses, each carrying an arm-
ful of bright red roses; their
escorts in white-tie and tails,
red roses in their button holes.
For a half-hour they wove a pat-

getting to Dartmouth Carnival
and Harvard-Yale game right
on schedule but dancing at Fan-
cy Dress didn’t come along until
I was well on the way to becom-
ing a Lexington matron — and
quite visibly Motherhood.

The 1942 Fancy Dress Ball
had an awful poignancy. The
United States was at war follow-
ing the attack on Pearl Harbor
two months before. The
students of that year could look
ahead to only one future
— military service.

The aura of special elegance
was over us all. The invitation
was as elaborate as a command
appearance before the King of
England, (with an _ enclosed
numbered card to be presented
at the door). One thousand
glamourous costumes were
shipped from Philadelphia to be
rented out to each couple for the
large sum of $5. Girls arrived in
town days ahead — using the

tern of turns, bows and spins.
Nobody staggered; no one saw
— or smelled — any sign of
alcohol. That alcohol was
around we did not doubt — but it
was discreetly nipped.

The floor stayed crowded
—and dry — until intermission
at one o’clock. Then on we went
to a “‘Supper.”” Ham, roast beef,
scalloped oysters, molded
salads — ending with a fantasy
dessert of sherbet draped in
spun sugar! The conversation
was light and local, for this
night we kept the world at bay.

We danced all night and
breakfasted in party clothes —
wilted red roses tossed away
—or even taken home to be
pressed in memory. By June
the campus was empty of its
dancers, not to be filled up
again for four years — and
when it did the world had
changed forever.

There are an estimated 1,000
children with Cystic Fibrosis in
Virginia.

The Buena Vista Jaycees and
Jaycettes will co-host the °82
Cystic Fibrosis 24-hour ‘“‘Dance
for Life’’ Dance-A-Thon begin-
ning Friday, March 19th at 7:00
p.m., and continuing until 7:00
p.m. Saturday evening, March
20th. The Dance-A-Thon will
take place at the American
Legion Building on Magnolia
Avenue in Buena Vista.

The “Dance for Life’’ Dance-
A-Thon is aptly named because
children with Cystic Fibrosis
literally have to fight for
breath. CF clogs their lungs
with choking mucus. 25 years
ago, few CF children lived long
enough to enter grade school.
Today, thanks to research fund-
ed by activities like the “Dance
for Life’? Dance-A-Thon, half
the children born with CF will,
live into their 20’s.

We need dancers 14 years of
age and up to sign up and dance
for CF and also have a chance

Changes By Rasmussen Improve duPont

by Alan Armitage

The duPont Art Gallery on the
Washington and Lee campus
has undergone some changes in
the past year all of which seem
to have been beneficial to the
gallery.

The first change was the ap-
pointment of William Ras-
mussen, an assistant professor
of art at Washington and Lee, to
the position of director of the
gallery.

Rasmussen, a Washington
and Lee graduate, worked for
the Virginia Museum in Rich-
mond for 4-1/2 years before
returning to W&L to be director
of duPont Gallery. At the
Virginia Museum, Rasmussen
was in charge of the children’s
_ educational exhibits.

“In Richmond I was in charge
of only one small aspect of the
entire museum,’’ said
Rasmussen, ‘“‘where as here
I’m responsible for the whole
operation of the gallery.”’

The other changes made in
the gallery over the past year
were part of the renovation of
the gallery. The walls have all
been redone to look more ap-
pealing, and a pair of glass
doors have been installed at the
entrance to give people in the
hall a view into the gallery

which might attract them in.

‘I would like to see more stu-
dent interest,’’ said Ras-
mussen. ‘‘Students who are tak-
ing art classes have to walk
through the gallery to get to
their classes, but very few other
students are aware of the ex-
hibits. I hope that students pass-
ing by and seeing the exhibits
will be drawn in.”

The gallery is geared mainly
toward W&L students. Exhibits
are kept on display for approx-
imately 3 weeks on the average.
‘In Richmond we would keep
an exhibit for 2 months or more
on the assumption that most
people don’t go to the museum
any more often than that,”’ said
Rasmussen. ‘‘But here at
Washington and Lee, with the
students coming’ through
several times a week to go to
class and very few townspeople
coming in, three weeks is a suf-
ficient period of time for an ex-
hibit.”

The exhibit schedule for the
1982-83 academic year was
finalized before W&L’s
Christmas break. ‘‘Some artists
enquire about exhibiting their
works, and others we have to go
look for,” said Rasmussen. ‘‘We
try to have at least one painter,
one sculptor, one print exhibit,

and then other exhibits, in-
cluding student shows and ex-
hibits on loan from the Virginia
Museum, to fill out the year.”’

According to Rasmussen, the
artists decide which pieces they
want to exhibit and submit a list
to him. He then has to discuss
with the artist exactly how and
where the piece can best be ex-
hibited.

“After getting an idea of what
the artist wants, I have to

year’s quarterfinals. The squad
hit 10 or 11 free throws down the
stretch to ice the victory.

Junior forward Brian Hanson

the most by a General this year,
to lead the team. Eppes added
15 points and guard George
Spears 12 as W&L shot 54.3 per-
cent from the field and 90.9 per-
cent from the charity stripe.

Scoring the first five points of
the game, the Generals raced to

design a floor plan, a lighting
plan, and any extra decorations
such as lattice-work,” Ras-
mussen said. ‘“‘Then, with some
student help, I set up the ex-
hibit. It takes about five hours
to set up and light an average
size exhibit.’’

Rasmussen feels that the
renovations have’ been
beneficial to the gallery by
making it easier for him to pre-

sent an exhibit in the best possi-
ble way. ‘‘I think that once the
community sees that we can
present a good exhibit in a pro-
fessional manner, interest in
the gallery will grow,”’ he said.

The gallery is open to the
public free of charge from 9
a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through
Friday; 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Satur-

days, and 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. on

never looked back en route to
posting their second-highest
point total of the year before 433
Warner Center fans.

The second half was merely a
clinic at both ends of the floor as
the Generals shot 60.3 percent
from the floor to record their
20th win of the season. Graves
led the team with 20 points and
Eppes added 17.

Billy Yates shot 86.2 percent
(75-87) from the foul line to set a
W&L single-season record,
breaking that of Jay Handlan
(85.8 percent) set way back in
1950-51. The team set records
for free throw shooting (77.0
percent) and field goal percen-
tage (51.3 percent) breaking

records set during the 1976-77
campaign. They also tied the
record of 15 home wins: (with
one loss) set that year.

“Tam basically satisfied with
the season as a whole,”’ said
Canfield. ‘‘This was supposed to
be a transition year with young
and inexperienced players and
without as much depth as we

have had in the past. To be na-
tionally ranked and tied for the
conference championship is a
pretty good achievement.

“I haven’t really thought
about next year much, but I’m
excited about the possibilities,
especially if we can start where
we left off.”
