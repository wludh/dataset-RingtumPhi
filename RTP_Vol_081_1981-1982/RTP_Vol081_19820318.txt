by John Harrison

It may be too early to start
making predictions, but if the
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team continues to play with the
same determination it showed
in last Saturday’s match with
Navy, the Generals should be
able to keep up with the highly
competitive teams that remain
on the schedule.

The Midshipmen’s potent of-
fense was supposed to be too
much for W&L’s relatively inex-
periencéd defense. The
Generals slowed down the tem-
po, however,: and forced the
game into overtime before los-
ing 11-10.

Head coach Jack Emmer was
very satisfied with what he saw
in the Generals’ first, home
game of the season. “I’m pleas-
ed with the overall effort and
particularly, the mental
preparation that was evident.
We were aggressive and men-
tally sharp. It proved that we
can play on the high level of a
team like Navy.”’

 

Generals Lose to Navy in O.T.
But Hand Lafayette 15-4 Loss

The game looked like it might
become a rout when Navy
scored two quick goals in the
opening minutes. But the
Generals started to get ag-
gressive on defense after John
Sancilio put W&L on the board
by spinning off one. man and
getting free for a shot directly
in front of the Navy goal.

The tight W&L defense forced
the Middies to wait on offense
and prevented them, from at-
tacking the goal consistently,
Navy’s usual style. By the end
of the first half, the Generals
had fashioned a 7-6 lead and ap-
peared capable of pulling off an
upset.

The bulk of W&L’s offense in
the first half was provided by
Lee Heimert, who came
through with three goals, and
Rob Staugaitis, who directed

the attack from behind the net
and assisted on two of
Heimert’s goals. Freshman

_ Mark Knobloch and attackman

Mike Lewers also notched their
first scores of the season.
Emmer was _ particularly
pleased with the work of
Heimert, who added a fourth
goal in the final quarter, and
goaltender Ware Palmer, ‘Lee
was our brightest star out there,
and Ware played well in goal

3 ~and intercepted some key

passes,”’ he said.

Navy regained the lead at 9-7
by shutting out the Generals in
the third quarter while netting
three goals of its own. On the
eighth Navy score, Rob Bianchi
was allowed to come from
behind the W&L goal and beat
Palmer uncontested.

The Generals continued to put

pressure on the Middie defense
but found that goalie Scott Bart-
kowski was equal to the test.
Said Emmer, “We peppered
their goal but couldn’t get it by
him.”’

After a Washington and Lee
timeout with two-and-a-half
minutes left, Heimert took a
pass from Staugaitis and flip-
ped it over Bartkowski’s
shoulder to cut the lead to one.
Then, with time running out,
Sancilio picked up a loose ball
at midfield and split the Navy
defense as he rushed straight
for the goal. Sancilio beat Bar-
tkowski with just 22 seconds
Showing.

Navy took the opening faceoff
of overtime and held the ball for
almost a minute before Mike
Ray beat Palmer with a low
shot from ten yards out.

N.C. State will be the next op-
ponent for the Generals on
Saturday.

“State is as explosive as
anybody in the country, a run
and gun team,” said Emmer.
The coach added that the
Wolfpack returns almost
everyone from last year.

Starting time for the match is
2:00 p.m. on Wilson Field. In the
event of wet grounds, the game
could be moved to Glen Maury
Park in Buena Vista.

That was exactly what hap-
pened yesterday as the
Generals crushed Lafayette
College i5-4 at Glen Maury. The
victory improved W&L’s record
to 2-1, while the Leopards were
playing their opening game.

John Sancilio led the
Generals’ attack with three
goals. Rob Carpenter and Joe
Seifert added two goals apiece.

W&L led all the way after
building a 7-1 lead in the first
quarter. Lafayette did not even
get a shot on goal until eight
minutes of the game had been
completed.

SAB Explains Fancy Dress Losses At EC Session

by J.R. Smith

A large turnout of candidates
for class offices turned in peti-
tions and the Student Activities
Board gave more details on its
post-Fancy Dress financial
position at the Executive Com-
mittee’s meeting Monday night.

44 students turned in petitions
for running for the class offices
of president, vice-president,
and E.C. representative in the
meeting.

Voting Regulation Board
chairman Mike Singer read the
voting rules to the candidates.
The regulations include a $16
spending limit, only ten posters
on campus at any one time, and
use of only one large banner per
candidate. Freshmen posters
are to be limited to the
freshman dorms and Evans
Dining Hall.

The election will be held
Mon., March 22, with run-offs
set for Thurs., March 25. Three
proposed amendments to the
student constitution are to be
voted on in the Monday election,
and polls for the referendum
will be open Tuesday and
Wednesday also.

S.A.B. co-chairman John
Martin and treasurer Randall
Jacoby submitted a financial
report, estimating the total loss
from Fancy Dress at $22,000.
The S.A.B., however, has close
to $20,000 left in its spring
budget, which, applied to the
deficit, would result in a debt of
around $2,000, according to
Jacoby.

E.C. President Eric Myers
asked about the status of the
Tuesday entertainment pro-
grams in the Cockpit. S.A.B.
member Bob Schmidt replied
that ‘Tuesdays in the Pit”
would be cancelled after this
week’s performance by The
Motive, but he pointed out that
self-sufficient events such as
performances by Skip Castro
and The Nighthawks are plan-
ned for the first week in the spr-
ing term.

Martin added that the S.A.B.
is placing ‘‘sort of a freeze on
funds” until all debts are
recovered.

Jacoby disagreed with the
idea of using self-sufficient
entertainment in the spring.
“The best thing to do,”’ he said,
“is to cut out all activities,
because I think it’s our fault and
we have to pay for it.”

E.C. member Tripp Brower
countered, ‘‘You have to take
into account those people who
chose not to go to Fancy Dress.
They expect something for their
money in the spring. It’s not fair
to these people.’’

Martin also had an answer for
Jacoby. “Entertainment must
go on, Randall,’ he said.
“There are other organizations
ahead of their budgets which
could help us out. Hall (Vet-
terlein, I.F.C. President) has
expressed some interest in help-
ing us with an outside concert in
the spring.”’

“Let’s go ahead and have
what we've planned,” E.C.
Secretary Bennett Ross inter-
jected. “You have a respon-
sibility to the students, and the
E.C. has a responsibility to help
you with it,’’ he added.

The S.A.B. members gave
several reasons for the $22,000
loss.

Martin cited the near-$6,000
bill from Buildings and Grounds
and the Athletic Department for
decoration and clean-up as a
problem.

‘“‘We had only two days to
decorate the gym — not a week,
as we were told we would have
last year. B&G really killed us
on the overtime. Paying $9.00
an hour to tear down wall paper
is pretty ridiculous,” Martin
said.

Jacoby added that the S.A.B.
had budgeted only $2,000 for
payment to Buildings and
Grounds.

Martin defended the use of a
professional to decorate
Warner Center.

“There was no way not to use
professionals to fix that gym in
two days,” he said. The S.A.B.
paid $6,475 for the professional
decorator’s services.

But Jacoby disagreed. ‘I
think it’s ridiculous to spend so
much on that,” he argued.

Martin also mentioned the
various decorations bought this
year which could be used for
future events, adding that these
costs would not be a problem
next year.

The ceiling used in Doremus
Gymnasium, which cost the
S.A.B. $3,245, can be used next
year, as can the $164 arbour,
$500 worth of cloth used in the
old gym, and the pictures which
were on display, which cost
$1181, according to Martin.

Low ticket sales were also a
problem, according. to both
Martin and Jacoby. Jacoby
reported that only 80 to 90 law
students bought _ tickets.
Schmidt said he felt the debt
would have been lower if facul-
ty and administration members
had been asked to pay their
way. '

Martin added, ‘‘if we had sold
2,000 tickets, it would be a dif-
ferent story here.

The S.A.B., following a talk
with the administration, had ex-
pected to sell around 2,000

tickets. ‘‘With that in mind, we
were thinking more toward sell-
ing 3,000 tickets, with the alum-
ni coming this year,’ Martin
added.

E.C. Law _ Representative
Morgan Griffith asked Martin if
a Thursday night concert
should be held next year.

“‘T liked the concert because it
gave the townspeople some-
thing to do,’” Martin answered.
Schmidt added that the S.A.B.
should have the concert next
year, but it should be smaller
and more self-sufficient.

E.C. representative Ben Hale
asked if there were problems
with members who did not con-
tribute their time to the
preparations for the ball.

“We didn’t do that much,”
answered Jacoby. ‘‘I think part
of the problem is that we didn’t
do things by ourselves.”’

Martin stated that all
members were signed up for
various jobs, but that some of
the people neglected to work.

Schmidt offered the option of
a mid-year review of the
members of the committee.

When all discussion was
finished, Myers gave his opi-
nion of the production. ‘‘I think
the figures were reasonable, I
think you played a good game,
and I think it worked out,” he
said.

Martin also had a statement
to make.

‘“‘We feel it was our deal to
pull off. I feel that next year, it’s
not going to be the problem it
was this year. I was talking to
Dean (Lewis) John after the
ball, and he said the money I
told him we were going to lose is
just the price we have to pay to
show we can make the gym
elegant,’’ Martin said.

Schmidt added, ‘‘We had
something special for the 75th
anniversary, and I think that, to
have a $67,000 show when we
started with only $20,000, to end
up only $2,000 in debt is pretty
good.””

Morgan Griffith moved that
the E.C. congratulate the S.A.B.
on the production of this year’s
Fancy Dress. The motion pass-
ed 10-1, with junior represen-
tative Frank Smith opposing.

Centel Cooperative
In other action, the E.C.
heard reports from its subcom-
mittees on a new student
telephone union, and from Con-
tact. The Centel cooperative
subcommittee submitted its in-
itial proposal concerning waiv-
ing phone deposit requirements

for W&L students.

SAB Kicked Out Of duPont
After Skin Flick Complaints

by Todd Smith

“‘We want sex, we want sex,”
cried students Saturday night
as they pounded on the doors of
duPont auditorium. They were
30 minutes early for the 11 p.m.
showing of an X-rated movie by
the Student Activities Board,
while inside “My Fair Lady”
was showing.

Complaints about this, and
the physical abuse of the
auditorium during the showing
of the skin-flick, led Dr. Al Gor-
don, head of the fine arts
department, to ban future SAB
films from duPont.

“They were screaming and
hollering and banging on the
door,’’ said Chris Peacock, the
projectionist for ‘My. Fair
Lady.”” He said that when
another SAB worker asked
them to quiet down, they just
got louder.

Gordon found duPont
auditorium abused when he
came to work Monday morning.

“They had burned cigarette
holes in the carpet and squirted
beer on the stage and screen,”
and he found four desk-tops
pulled from the lecture hall’s
seats.

According to Gordon, the aud-
titorium was remodeled and
carpeted in September for ex-
panded use. He worried about
the showing of X-rated movies
‘not because it was porno, but
because it generally attracts an
audience that is very hard to
control.”

“I think when students go toa
movie they ought to be able to
relax and enjoy themselves, to
take in food and drinks,” said
Gordon. “I just have to insist
that it not be in this room.”

This week’s SAB film will pro-
bably be shown in the law
school, according to Randall

“Jacoby, treasurer of the SAB.
_He said that some films may
_wind up being presented in Stu-

dent Center rooms 112 and 113.

Jacoby denies that more than
one desk was damaged during
the showings.

The SAB was investigating
the possibility of removing
sound equipment from the
auditorium which it claims it
purchased, board members
Said.

John Martin, co-chairman of
the SAB, said that members
had been cleaning up _ the
auditorium after use, and
removing bottles and trash.

Gordon, however, said that
the room was ‘“‘a mess’ on
Saturday, and that the SAB had
to be called to clean it up for a
recital.

“I think the students were
comfortable with going to du-
Pont for movies and trashing
it,” said Assistant Dean Mike
Cappeto, who works with the
SAB. “That was never a pro-
blem until it was remodeled.”

W&L’s baseball team opened
its season on a promising note
with two routs of West Virginia
Tech and an extra inning loss to
Division II power California
State (Pa.).

Before this weekend’s games
the pitching staff had been a bit
of a question mark. But, seniors
Rich Hachenberg and David
Randall and freshman Billy
White all turned in superb per-
formances in starting roles last
weekend.

Coach Jim Murdock expected
the strong performances from
his seniors, but he was extreme-
ly pleased by White’s strong
performance in his first col-
legiate game.

In Friday’s game, West
Virginia Tech jumped out to an
early 1-0 lead, but W&L

responded with a_ three-run
third and a single run in the 4th.
Dave Warrenfeltz slammed a
homer to rightfield to highlight
the rally.

After Tech had scored a run
in the top of the 8th to narrow
the lead to 4-2, W&L responded
with eight runs in the bottom
half. :

The Generals mixed some
key hits with a few Tech errors
and a lot of walks. Mark
McLaughlin cracked two
doubles in the inning as the
Generals built a 12-2 lead.

Hachenberg finished off Tech
in the ninth to pick up his first
win of the new season. Hachen-
berg allowed only four hits and
three walks.

Saturday’s rematch with
West Virginia Tech followed the
same pattern as Friday’s game.
Tech jumped out to a 1-0 lead off
David Randall before W&L re-
bounded for a 9-1 win.

“It took us a little while to get
the bats going again,”’ noted
Murdock.

At the plate, junior Tim Daly

provided the real fireworks
though.

Ellis ripped a bases-loaded
triple and then scored on the

W&L Tennis

Has Tough
Weekend

by David Stuart

The score was 6-7, 6-3, 6-6, and
Washington and Lee freshman
Andy Haring trailed the 12-point
tiebreaker 6-5. After a
short rally, Haring’s backhand
went long to end the match.

It was a sudden finish to a
grueling see-saw duel and a
turning point in the tennis
match Sunday against the
University of Charleston on the
W&L courts.

Three tiebreaker losses and
the absence of No. 2 player Wes
Yonge were factors in the 6-3
loss. Sophomore Jim Irwin (No.
4 singles) was shaken 6-7, 0-6
and freshman Stephen Bend-
heim suffered a 3-6, 6-7 defeat.

Yonge, the veteran senior,
was sick with the flu and missed
three matches. Junior varsity
coach Howard Ainsley, substi-
tuting for an absent Gary
Franke, said, ‘“‘The tiebreakers
definitely hurt us.”’

Despite a tough weekend with
three losses to California State
(9-0), the University of
Rochester (9-0), and the
University of Charleston (6-3),
Franke is not discouraged.

“I’m not concerned so much
with our won-loss record during
the season, as compared to the
O.D.A.C. Tournament and

Randall pitched a complete
game in picking up the win. He
allowed seven hits and no walks
while fanning twelve batters.

Sunday’s contest with Califor-
nia State (Pa.) was a pitcher’s
duel from the start.

W&L freshman Bill White
kept Cal State hitless through
three innings. After nine the
game was even at 1-1, but Cal
State scored twice in the top of
the 10th and stopped a General
rally to win, 3-2.

In the fifth, senior Jeff Hag-
gerty walked, stole second, and
moved to third on a throwing er-

ror. He scored on a single by
sophomore Mike Walsh, giving
W&La 1-0 lead.

White worked his way out of
trouble many times until finally
yielding the tying run in the 9th.
The Cal State runner scored
from second on a wild pitch and
a throwing error.

In the 10th, Cal State scored
two unearned runs off senior
Jim Brockelman and held the
Generals to only one. The lone
W&L run came across on a Jim
Daly double and a sacrifice fly
by Dave Warrenfeltz.

Freshman Busbee Paces
Track To 76-68 Victory

Freshman Chris Busbee cap-
tured two individual events and
participated on two winning
relay teams to pace the
Washington and Lee_ track
squad to a 76-68 victory over
Davidson College on Saturday.

Times of 23.645 seconds in the
200-meter race and 52.33
seconds in the 400-meter event
enabled Busbee to win both. He
combined with classmates
Chris Ives and Scott Henderson
and sophomore Kevin Kadesky
to win the 440-relay in 44.83
seconds and with Pembroke,

Paul Chapman, and Martin
Pruitt to take the milerelay ina
time of 3:31.40.

The Generals’ strength in the
running events was evident as
they claimed six of ten running
competitions and placed at
least second in those that they
didn’t win. However, the squad
only won two of seven field
events.

Sophomore Charlie Alcorn led
a trio of three Generals who
earned points in the discus
throw, and the team placed

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

The SAB (Cont’d)

The great debate over the Fancy Dress overruns
continued last week, only this time there was fighting
among members of the S.A.B. troupe.

At Monday night’s Executive Committee meeting,
S.A.B. Treasurer Randall Jacoby and his boss,
S.A..B. Co-chairman John Martin, clearly had
disagreements over how the board should be run for
the remainder of the year. Jacoby seems to want to
run the S.A.B. under tight fiscal policy, while Martin
believes that the campus is hungry for entertainment.

To its credit, the E.C. did not take this infighting as
a sign of weakness on the S.A.B.’s part. Rather than
nitpicking over the various cost overruns, the E.C.
seemed more concerned with the status of campus
entertainment for the rest of the year.

Perhaps the most profound point was raised by
Senior Representative Tripp Brower, who questioned
the fairness of denying entertainment to students who
did not attend the ball. Martin. seemed to have the
best solution to this problem when he speculated that
the S.A.B. might be able to go in on a concert with an
organization that is ahead of its budget.

We see the purpose of the S.A.B. as that of providing
entertainment to the campus. When the funds run
dry, the S.A.B. should not retire into a shell, but
should actively seek other ways to stage concerts.
John Martin made this point clear at Monday night’s
meeting. We think he is right.

Students Win Business Games

A team of students from
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics won top
honors in the 1982 Inter-
collegiate Business Games in
Atlanta, Ga., last month.

Washington and Lee’s team
was composed of Andy Gott-
schalk of Lake Forest, IIl.,;
John Monroe of New Orleans,
La.; Brian Noonan of Charlotte,
N.C.; and, Bob Wittpenn of Glen
Ridge, N.J. All are seniors.

Dr. Joseph Goldsten, pro-
fessor of administration at
W&L, served as faculty adviser
to the team.

The Intercollegiate Business
Games are sponsored annually
by the Graduate Business
Association of the Graduate
School of Business Administra-
tion at Emory University in
Atlanta.

Washington and Lee was one
of 24 colleges and universities
participating in the games

which began in early January
when the W&L team took over a
hypothetical firm and attempt-
ed to improve that firm’s pro-
fitability.

“We became the manage-
ment of a firm we called ‘Lee
Labs.’ Our firm produced
aspirin and an aspirin product
with codeine,” Wittpenn ex-
plained.

“Our task in the games was to
take this hypothetical company,
which had been standing still
because of poor management,
and create, then implement, a
strategy that would turn that
company around.”

By using a computer terminal
on the W&L campus that was
tied directly into a central com-
puter at Emory, the W&L team
made a series of decisions each
week as it guided the company
through three years of its
development in two months

tima

“In establishing our strategy,
we had to take numerous
variables into consideration, in-
cluding the current business
climate and forecasts of the
future economic _ situation,”
said Monroe.

After all the weekly decisions
had been made and Lee Labs
was thriving, the W&L team
joined its competitors for two
final days of competition in
Atlanta where all the teams
were required to make presen-
tations before panels of judges.
The judges included members
of the Emory faculty, graduate
business students at Emory,
and representatives of industry.
*“The competition held in
Atlanta was about 50 percent of
the entire game,” explained

Wittpenn. “It was a real
pressure-cooker.
The championship was

Washington and Lee’s second in
the competition. W&L’s team

Born in New York City and
educated in public schools
there, Wald received a bachelor
of sciences degree from New
York University in 1927 and
earned a Ph.D. degree in 1932
from Columbia University,
where he was a student and
research assistant of Professor
Selig Hecht.

Awarded a National Re-
search Council Fellowship in
Biology in 1932, he began the
fellowship in the laboratory of
Otto Warburg in Berlin-
Dahlem. That is where Wald
first identified Vitamin A in the
retina. Vitamin A had, at the
time, been isolated in the
laboratory of Paul Karrer in

 

Biologist Wald Talks Tonight

Zurich where Wald completed
the identification. He also work-
ed in the laboratory of Otto
Meyerhoff at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute in
Heidelberg, where he
discovered retinal (Vitamin A
aldehyde), a component of the
visual cycle.

Wald went to Harvard in the
fall of 1934 as a tutor in
biochemical sciences. He has
been there ever since: as an in-
structor and tutor in biology
(1935-44), associate professor
(1944-48), and professor (1948-).
He received the Higgins Chair
in Biology in 1968 and was nam-

emeritus in 1977.

Having retired from
teaching, Wald currently
“divides his time between what
he thinks of as his outer and in-
ner lives: mostly the outer,
spent trying to keep the human
species from self-extinction;
and in time spared from that,
trying to come to terms with the
realm of consciousness, beyond
space and time.”’

Wald has received numerous
prizes and awards from a varie-
ty of fields, including biochem-
istry, ophthamology and optics.
In 1953, he received the
