Executive Committee Freezes SBA Funds

by Ben Jarratt

The Student Bar Association
had its funds frozen by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night, when an ‘SBA subcom-
mittee failed to appear before
the E.C. to give its monthly
report.

During the fall, the E.C.
adopted a proposal to freeze
funds if a subcommittee did not
appear before the E.C.

Morgan Griffith, Third-year
Law Rep., said the SBA would
not be able to present its report,
as the officers are currently
undertaking an extensive bar
preparation course. He mo-
tioned that the E.C. suspend the
requirement for this month’s
report and let the SBA present a
double report in March.

Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., stated the
officers should have made con-
tact with the E.C. There is a re-
quirement that a subcommittee
should contact the E.C., if it
would not be able to send a
representative.

“I’m perfectly sympathetic
with the SBA,” stated Ben Hale,
’84 Rep., ‘‘but we agreed earlier
in the year a subcommittee
should call us. We are bound by
that vote.”’

Tom Booher, First-year Law

Rep., expressed concern that
freezing funds would hinder the
SBA. He said the SBA was plan-
ning a Valentine’s Party this
weekend and would not be able
to pay expenses.

“‘T think it’s going to ruffle
feathers across the creek,’
stated E.C. Vice-president Jim
Averett. According to Averett,
Griffith’s motion that the SBA
be given an extension to March

was defeated 4-8. Griffith,
Booher, Averett and John
Viahoplus, ’84 Rep., voted in
favor of the motion.

Hale then moved that the SBA
funds be frozen until E.C. Presi-
dent Eric Myers talks to the of-
ficers. Myers can unfreeze the
funds, if he receives a satisfac-
tory reply. The motion passed
9-3. Griffith, Booher and
Viahoplus opposed. Myers said
he would try to clear this matter
up immediately.

Contact

Contact Co-chairmen R.D.
McLean and Mike Drinkwater
said the honorarium for F. Lee
Bailey cost $4,750. The other
speakers had averaged $2,500
this year. ‘‘With someone with a
name that Bailey has,” stated
Drinkwater, “‘you’re going to
have to pay that kind of figure.”’

Lang suggested the co-
chairmen talk to Henry Feuers-
tein of Focus about getting con-
gressmen to speak during
Spring term. Feurerstein
reported to the E.C. last week
that he could bring several con-
gressmen to W&L at minimal
costs.

Student Health

Thad Ellis reported the Stu-
dent Health Committee was
concerned that not enough
students were aware of the in-
surance policies at W&L. The
Student Handbook publishes
this information.

The committee also looked in-
to emergency procedures at the
athletic facilities. The athletic

‘department cannot afford a full-
time doctor to be present during
games. According to Ellis, if an
accident occurred, the biggest
problem is the legal aspect.
School Trainer Tom Jones
would be capable of handling

emergencies, but he is not a.

 

_ E.C. member Ben Hale.

doctor.

Ellis said there may be a
problem with the training room
during the Washington holiday
when two trainers will be out of
town. The athletic department
said it would handle this prob-

lem.
The school infirmary will

have restricted hours, but these
hours will be posted. Ellis said
W&L students have 24-hour ac-
cess to the emergency room at

Stonewall Jackson Hospital.
Courses and Degrees

Mike Skardon reported that
he and Brian Gibson are
relatively ineffective on the
Committee of Courses and
Degrees. They are not informed
on what is being brought up for
consideration.

“There are a few incidents -

where they try to slip stuff
through the back door,” stated

Skardon. The co.mmittee once

considered dropping the Dean’s
List. “A lot of faculty members
think the Dean’s List is a
farce.”

Colt Puryear reported the
Freshmen Admissions Commit-
tee discussed the policy of ac--
cepting sons of alumni to W&L
as a rule. There was a question
of whether one student had ac-
ceptable grades and SAT scores
in high school.

Henry Baey reported the In-
ternational Club will sponsor an
International Day in the spring.
Tentative plans include an In-
ternational Childrens’ Art Ex-
hibit, a Chinese opera and a
special meal in Evans Dining

Mike Gregory said the Outing
Club had one ski trip to

of weather. It seems the club
was involved in a three-car ac-
cident on the way to the slopes.

12 Law Students Work In VITA Program

Twelve Washington and Lee
University law students will get
an opportunity to help low-
income residents of Rockbridge
County while learning more
about federal tax laws during
the next several weeks.

The students will participate
in VITA (Volunteer Income Tax
Assistance), a free tax prepara-
tion program sponsored by the
Taxpayer Assistance Division
of the Internal Revenue Ser-
vice. IRS provides materials,
training, and advice to
volunteer tax form preparers
through VITA.

“This service is really needed
by low-income people. If a pro-
gram like this weren’t avail-
able, they would end up going to
a commercial tax preparer and
getting charged,’ said Alan
Munro, the second-year law stu-
dent who initiated the VITA pro-
gram here.

The service will be offered
Tuesday from 6 to 9 p.m. and
Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4
p.m. from 13 until April 13. It
will be located at the Legal Aid
Society office at 203 N. Main St.
in Lexington.

The volunteers, who include
several Lexington residents as
well as the law students, have
been trained by IRS personnel
to complete 1040 and 1040A
federal income tax forms.

Participants in VITA are en-
couraged to bring their new tax
form, last year’s completed
return, all W-2 forms issued to
them, and other relevant finan-
cial data.

Though the volunteer tax
preparers will check all of the
returns they help complete for
mistakes in mathematics and

substance, persons who use
VITA are responsible for the

contents of their returns.
Elderly, low-income, and
handicapped people are

especially encouraged to take
advantage of this free service.

The other W&L law students
who are involved in VITA, in ad-
dition to Munro, are Jamie
Canup, Donna Gray, Fred
Earley, Cindy Harrington, Ted
Loper, C. Jay Robbins, Doug
Payne, Lynn Hoshall, John
Kent, Mike Farr, and Linda
Klein.

Selective Enforcement Of Noise Violations Alleged

by Scott Mason

In recent years, Washington
and Lee fraternities have
become greatly restricted with
the formation and enforcement
of strict University rules and
procedures. Of late, however,
the butt of these restrictions has
come not from the University
but from the Lexington Police
Department in the form of noise
violations.

Nevertheless, evidence sug-
gests that the Lexington Police
Department has been deviating
from written laws specifically
Stated in the Lexington, Virginia,

Charter and Code of Laws
regarding noise and the
amplification of sound.

According to the Lexington
code (section 15-33), it is
“unlawful for any person to
make use of sound-amplifying
equipment or loudspeakers, in
such a manner and that the
sound or noise thereof is audible
to the public, without a written
permit from the city manager.”
Lexington Chief of Police,
James A. Kirby, states that
anyone amplifying music must
have a permit and that this pro-
cedure ‘‘applies to everyone in
the city.”

The ‘permit to amplify
music’ enables music to be
played for a period of no longer
than three hours Monday
through Thursday or beyond 11
p.m. Friday and Saturday the
permit allows music to be
played for a period of no more
than four hours or beyond mid-
night.

According to an employee of
the Old Main Street Shopping
Mall, a group named the Down
Home Band had been practicing
for approximately one year in a
vacant room located above the
Mall. Practice sessions usually
took place every Tuesday and
Thursday evening between 5:30
and 6 p.m. The band had never
filed for a permit.

Approximately four weeks
ago, Lexington police received
a complaint in regard to ex-
cessive noise at the Old Main
Street Shopping Mall. Edwin J.
Curran, a sophomore residing
at the Phi Delta Theta fraterni-
ty house, a block from the Mall,
said he witnessed police officers
arrive at the scene, only to call
up to a window of the Mall, ask-
ing the band members to tone
down the music.

Curran said the noise was ex-
cessively loud and had been on
previous occasions as well. Kir-
by initially denied knowing
anything about the incident.
Later, however, he recalled
that a complaint had come in
regarding a disturbance at the
Old Main Street Mall, but he
had no further knowledge of the
details involved.

Kirby acknowledged that
under the Lexington code, the
band was required to file for a;
permit to amplify music. Dur-

‘Kappa Alpha,

ing that year-long period,
however, no permit was ever

2d and no violation was ever
issued,

Employees of the White Col-
umn Inn said that bards hired
for Friday and Saturday nights
usually perform from approx-
imately 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., or
until closing. The White Column
Inn only once has filed for a per-
mit toamplify music.

Ironically, Lexington police
have issued only one noise
violation to The White Column
Inn and that violation was given
the very date that the Inn’s lone
permit was filed. Contrary to
statements made by White Col-
umn Inn employees, Chief Kir-
by remarked that The White
Column Inn “has gotten per-
mits in the past.”

Under the Lexington code of
laws, The White Column Inn is
required to file for permits to
amplify music whenever bands
play there.

Records indicate that during
the months of September 1981
through January 1982, 175 noise
permits were granted by the
Lexington Police Dapartment,
174 of which were issued to
Washington and Lee fraternity
houses.

Eight fraternities, including
Kappa Alpha, Sigma Chi, Pi
Phi Kappa
Sigma, Phi Gamma Delta,
Sigma Phi Epsilon, and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon were in violation
of the Lexington sound-ampli-
fying code since that time and
were placed on two weeks social
probation by the University.

Chief Kirby stated that at the
start of the academic year,
fraternities are first given one
warning before any violations
are issued. Officer W.F. Knick
Jr. confirmed the one-warning
procedure.

Nonetheless, presidents of the

 

eight fraternities in violation of
the noise code since September
each specifically stated that
they had never received any
warning prior to the violations
bestowed by Lexington police.

Though Lexington police did
administer a warning to the
band members of the Old Main
Street Shopping Mall, no warn-
ing, according to the eight
fraternity presidents, was ever
given in any of the incidents
since September involving a
violation of the noise code.

Almost one year ago,
members of the Washington
and Lee Law School rented the
Beta Theta Pi fraternity house
during the undergraduate
Washington Holiday in mid-
February. The students never
applied for a permit to amplify
music nor were they ever issued
a violation of the Lexington

sound-amplifying code. Chief
Kirby remarked that the law
students would, indeed, need a
permit but had no knowledge of
the incident.

When questioned whether
church bells or the sounding of
the Virginia Military Institute
cannon would fall under section
15-31 of the Lexington code of
laws as “noise generally,”’
Chief Kirby said that the V.M.I.
cannon would qualify, but that
because V.M.I. is a military,
state-owned school, ‘‘they have
certain things they can do.”’

Kirby added that church bells
would not fall under the code
but gave no further explana-
tion. .

Evidence has arisen that may
show that certain private
groups in Lexington have not
had to comply with the same
amplified noise restrictions that

police impose on fraternities.

Although fraternities are re-
quired to obtain noise permits
before parties, a local band has
regularly practiced ja=town,
and the White Column ‘Inn*fias
had bands without obtaining the
permits,

Also, the police have issued at
least a warning fo ‘that local
band, despite a policy of no
warnings for the fraternities.

Chief Kirby flatly stated that
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment is “not discriminating
against students” with regard
to permits and violations of the
Lexington noise code. Kirby
said that the ‘‘same guidelines”’
apply to fraternities as well as
to Lexington citizens. Yet, says
Kirby, ‘Fraternities are lucky
to get as many permits as they
do,”’ and he charges fraternities
of having ‘‘wild parties.”’

Fowler Promoted To Lt. Col.

David F. Fowler Jr., pro-
fessor of military science at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, has been promoted to the

The W&L indoor track team
now has one meet’s experience
under its belt and as it ventures
to Lynchburg College this
Saturday for the annual Lynch-
burg indoor relays. This meet,
which includes a number of
ODAC teams, will serve as a
final tune-up for the tracksters
before the upcoming ODAC in-
door championship on Feb. 27 in
Lexington (V.M.1.).

The Generals’ showing at last
weekend’s VMI relays did not
prove to be decisive in terms of
total scoring, but the team gain-
ed valuable input. Highlighting
the meet for the Generals was

three seconds off the winning
time.

Shot putter John McKee had
an indoor personal-best effort
with a heave of 42’-11’’. The toss
should rank him among the
leaders in the ODAC this
season.

The rest of the General sauad
participated in its respective
events and Head Coach Norris
Aldridge was pleased with his
team’s performances and pro-
gress.

Weight and event Coach
Frank Miriello was quoted as
saying, ‘‘at a big meet like VMI,
one has to set a goal and stick
with it. Anything beyond that is

attitude,’ said Miriello. ‘At
W&L we realize the athlete’s
potential and go with reason-
able standards for them no mat-
ter what kind of competition
they’re in.”

The indoor season is coming
down to the wire and this week’s
meet at Lynchburg looms large.
If the Generals make a good
showing their chances for an in-
door title could be strong. This
will be the team’s first test
against comparable opponents,
a factor the Generals have been
anticipating all winter long.

Generals’ lone setback of the
dav came in the first round, in
which Catawba College took a
24-16 decision.

Captain Tim Valliere (158)

(heavyweight), and freshman
Jeff Dixon sustained the solid
performances that they have
given during the season by win-
ning all three of their matches.

(plus a win by forfeit).
Freshman Joe O’Neill scored a
21-0 margin in his two victories.

Head Coach Gary Franke was
satisfied with the work in the
upper weight classes but be-
lieves that the lower classes
should have done better. Said
the coach, “I was a little disap-
pointed with the lower weights,
but at the same time the four
guys in the upper weights did
well.”

Tonight the Generals will be
away for the last time this
season as they take on the
University of Richmond. Judg-
ing from what happened the last

time the same two teams met,
the Generals will have to be
well-prepared for the match.

“They have a good 126
pounder and a good heavy-
weight and their 158 man beat
Tim back in December,”’
Franke noted.

The season will end with a
1:30 p.m. duel meet Saturday
against Lynchburg and
Hampden-Sydney and a 7:30
p.m. match Tuesday against

 

Longwood. Both matches will

be held in the Warner Center.

On Wednesday, Franke will
determine who will represent
W&L in the NCAA Eastern Re-
gionals which will be held on
Sat., Feb. 20.

Bridgewater earlier in the
season.

Two other relatively easy vic-
tories, a 75-60 defeat of Catholic
University and a 72-46 crushing
of Lynchburg College, upped
the Generals’ record to 16-5, and
they maintained their grasp on
first place in the ODAC with a
9-2 conference mark.

You name it, Bridgewater us-
ed it to try to stop the Generals
high-powered offensive attack.
They opened in a simple 2-3
zone, but senior guard George
Spears scored six points in the
early going to propel W&L to a
quick 14-3 lead. The Eagles then
switched to a man-to-man, but
that didn’t fare much better as
the Generals steadily increased
their lead and stopped Bridge-
water cold on offense.

Brian Hanson’s basket at the
halftime buzzer gave the
Generals a 41-19 lead going into
the locker room. Bridgewater
shot a miserable 26.9% from the

Fencing Club Triumphs

by John M. Cleghorn

“A real trouncing’’ are the
words W&L fencing club cap-
tain David Hepler used to
desoribe their victory over The
Citadel this past Saturday at
Warner Center. Virginia
Military Academy also de-
feated The Citadel in the same
competition.

The Citadel was W&L’s third
match of the season after.an

18-9 loss Navy and a 13-14 loss to
VMI, a match described by

Hepler as ‘“‘about as close as
you can get.”’

A fencing match is made up of
27 bouts, the winner of the ma-
jority being the match victor.
Competition is divided into
three weapon categories, the
sabre, the foil, and the epee. In
each category there are three
team members who compete
against the other team in a
round-robin event making 27
bouts.

Against The Citadel, W&L’s
sabre team members scored
the bulk of the wins. Clyde

Harkrader, Pat Berg, an
Chuck Depois won each of their
bouts to give W&L nine wins.

Each weapon carries its own
set of rules. The epee competi-
tion counts a touch for any con-
tact to the body as a score. The
sabre scoring zone is limited to
the upper body and the foil is
further limited to the torso only.
The winner of the bout is the
first to score five touches.

A touch in both the foil and
epee categories can be scored
with the point of the weapon on-
ly. The sabre touch can be
scored with a slashing motion.
These differences are traceable
to the weapons’ origins, the foil
and epee being used for actual
fencing while sabres resembled
those used by mounted cava-
liers, ; :

nationals this year, the Virginia —

Commonwealth meet will be the
last regular season home meet
for senior co-captains Mike Ber-
not and Herb Gresens.

Gresens summed up his feel-
ings about the final meet when
he noted ‘I’ve been swimming
since I was seven or so, and I’ve
put a lot of effort into it. So ina
way it’ll be a relief and in a way
it’ll be kind of sad.”’

Although the VCU meet will
be the last home meet, the
Generals still will compete in
several roads meets starting
with a Sat., Feb. 13 encounter
with Georgetown and Glassboro
State.

‘‘We want to come out of that
meet with a split,” said Remil-
lard.

The Glassboro meet offers the
possibility of a battle of cham-
pions in the 50-yard freestyle
event. W&L boasts the swim-

mers with the first and fourth °

best times nationally in the
event while Glassboro State
swimmers occupy the second
and third positions.

‘‘We’re going to swim to win
the meet, not to win the 50
freestyle at the expense of the
meet,”’ indicated Remillard,
who downplayed the impor-
tance of any single event.

Over the Washington holiday
break, the Generals compete in
the U.N.C.-Wilmington Invita-
tional on Feb. 18, 19 and 20.

‘“‘Last year we were 7th in the
meet. This year we want to
break into the top three,”
Remillard said.

“The majority of our swim-
mers will try to qualify for Na-
tionals at this meet,”’ Remillard
added. Remillard expects both
relay teams to qualify for the
Nationals, along with W&L
swimmers placing in the top 10

national times nationally in’

every event.

Considering W&L proceded to

could say the team responded in
grand style.

Peterson, McClain

Earn A-A Honors -

Washington and Lee water
polo standouts Erik Peterson
and Rand McClain, both
residents of Miami, Florida,
have been selected to the Diviv-
sion III All-America teams an-
nounced this month by the
American Water Polo Caoches’
Association.

Peterson, a junior, received
recognition on the seven-
member first team while Mc-
Clain, a sophomore, was named
to the seven member second
team. Their selection marks the

second consecutive year the
Association has honored two
W&L players. Last winter cur-
rent sophomore Don Smith
received first team laurels and
classmate Tim Rock second-
team mention.

“These All-America honors
are true signs of our program’s
progress and the player’s pro-
gress,” relates Head Coach
Page Remillard, whose 1981
team posted an impressive 31-5
record and claimed the
Southern League champion-

    

ship. ‘‘And, as all four of these
athletes will be on the 1982
team, we look for continued suc-

~ cess.”

Whereas Rock and Smith pro-
ved themselves primarily on
defense, Peterson and McClain
were offensive mainstays for
the Generals. Peterson col-
lected a season record 152 goals
while McClain led the team in
assists. ‘“‘Eric’s scoring figure
speaks for itself; however, he
would not have had nearly that
number without Rand passing

to him. Conversely, Rand’s
assist capabilities were indeed
due partly to Erik’s scoring
abilities,’’ explains Remillard.

Peterson, who earned his first
W&L polo letter this past season
after transferring to the Univer-
sity, served along with Rock as
the team co-captian. McClain, a
two-year letterman, is current-
ly a key freestyle sprinter on
the Generals’ swimming team,
where he has the chance to earn
another All-America award,”’
according to the coach.

The E.C. Midterm Report: What’s Missing?

In the six months since the academic year
began, the Executive Committee has watched

student body funds efficiently, preserved the
honor system diligently, dealt with the press

honestly and been more straightforward with
the student body than any E.C. in recent

memory.

 

 

Ken Lang, Senior Rep., during Monday’s Executive Committee meeting, debates
Contact’s expenditures on F. Lee Bailey. To his left are representatives Frank
Smith, Ted McQuiston, and Cole Dawson.

 

And yet, something is missing.
—

by Todd Smith

If one were to make a policy
of what the E.C. has done this
year it would be very much like
Ronald Reagan’s Voluntarism:
“The government that governs
best, governs least.”’

To do so, however, would be
to assign a policy where there is
none.

The Executive Committee
waits for people and provicits
to gravitate towards it, then
quickly and efficiently, honestly
and straightforwardly probes
and brightens the issues.

Then it waits for the next
issue.

E.C. representatives and
others can quickly point out: (1)
that they are too busy with the
honor system to increase their
workload, (2)° that they are
elected as mediators, facil-
itators and budgeters, nor
legislative super-heroes, (3)
that there are no real problems
for them to address, and (4)
that the criticism is unjust and
they do initiate solutions to pro-
blems without being prodded.

Morgan Griffith, Third-year
Law Rep., certainly needs no
prodding, having brought in for
debate two of the largest issues
of the year: a possible tele-

phone cooperative that would
eliminate deposit payments for

students, and the possible addi-
tion of two members to the com-
mittee.

But with these two issues
spoken for, the remainder of the
year’s activities seems to be
reaction to subcommittee
reports.

The E.C. can proudly point to
three revisions students made
in the constitution in mid-
October. One of the revisions
allows for more fair representa-
tion for law students and would
not have passed without the
E.C.’s effort, particularly the
door-to-door campaign of Presi-
dent Eric Myers.

Whatever is missing is small.
It is hard to pinpoint blame.
Several representatives have
felt something lacking them-
selves and expressed off-the-
record dissatisfaction.

To take Myers to the wood-
shed for his leadership is

wrong. The E.C. is a group of

leaders, not a train of circus
elephants. Remember that the
off-the-record dissatisfaction
last year was that then-
President Bob Willis and Vice
President Willie Mackie
domineered the E.C. While

   

Putting the student body to use, in September the E.C. interviews
applicants for membership on faculty committees.

Myers has not been any great
inspiration, he has worked hard
and performed well the role
assigned him.

Assume that we cannot blame
mankind in general, or the stu-
dent body, which is so disin-
terested that large chunks of it
offer themselves each spring
for election as representatives.

The burden of responsibility,
then, for what has: been a
mediocre year for debate, in-
itiative and effective. grams
from the E.C. must rest on each
member’s shoulders. It is a
small burden, because they are
one of the most honest and
diligent E.C.’s in a long time.
They could be better, that’s all.

The members could pursue
the idea of an alternative social
program, which was brought up

at budget hearings in Septem-
ber, though no one will
remember. They could pursue
the idea of alcohol counseling,
which Myers investigated as a
junior representative. They
could make use of the people
who. turn out. for work on ad-
visory committees and are not
appointed, especially freshmen.
They could do a little more work
on the subcommittees they are
assigned to (subcommittees
monitor groups like the SAB,
Contact, etc.)

In an October interview
Myers said, “I think I’d like to
decentralize things a little
more.” With that he threw the
ball to the rest of the commit-
tee. Now. if more people would
just stop standing around look-
ing at it.

 

 

MORGAN GRIFFITH

-Law Representative

Morgan Griffith takes the Ex-
ecutive Committee home with
him to the lawschool after the
meeting, and is thereby the
most valuable member of the
year. He proposed a telephone
cooperative to lower costs and
brought up the problem of
under-representation of fresh-
men and law students. Griffith
reminds the E.C. of law student
opinions and _ needs, and
chastises in his apologetic way
the subcommittees like Contact
which overlook the law school
schedule.

Griffith’s knowledge of law

 

school problems makes Lewis
Hall the best represented lobby
in student government. But he
is fair with undergraduate con-
cerns, too. He speaks when he
has something to say, which is
often. Outside of the E.C. room,
he plugs the organizations he
knows need help. He has even
solicited writers for the Ring-
tum Phi, and has once come by
himself to help with layout.

Griffith obviously cares about
the job he is doing and the stu-
dent body will watch hopefully
to see if he runs for re-election.

BEN HALE

 

 

Sophomore Representative

Ben Hale is by far the wittiest
of the E.C. representatives. He
is smart, honest, diligent and
sensitive to students’ needs. But
he has gone downhill this year.

Hale was a_ tremendous
presence during the budget
hearings. He filled in the gaps
and asked the necessary ques-
tions and then put the budget re-
quest into motion form. He pro-
bably did this to make things
move quickly, not to affix his
name to the minutes. For the
next two months, Hale took ma-
jor roles in discussions. Hale
was primarily answerable for
the Intellectual Symposium,
which was later picked up and

developed by students. Hale’s
concerns about the Contact
Speakers program were clearly
and convincingly voiced.

Yet, Hale seemed to run out of
steam and now takes a smaller
role in debate. It was a case of
the irresistible force being sat

_ upon by the immovable object

— in this case, the lack of
substantial issues and enlight-
ened, enthusiastic causes. Or
perhaps his studies piled up.
Whatever the reason, Hale
moved down to the level of the
rest of the E.C. somewhere dur-
ing the year; he is smart,
honest, etc.

KEN LANG

Senior Representative

Ken Lang never lets a budget
slip through his fingers without
understanding and approving
it. His comments are sharp at
the meetings, which are usually
given over to the questioning of
subcommittees on their spen-
ding.

Lang represents a different
side of many arguments and
this is important. Lang seems
motivated by a genuine sense of
service, speaking not just to
hear himself speak. He fought a
measure that would have re-
scinded two students appointed
by the E.C. to the Publications
Board on the grounds that peo-
ple mattered more than an am-
biguous phrase in the constitu-

 

tion. He lost, but worked out a
compromise that put the two
back into the meetings.

Lang fought the motion by
Frank Smith to recommend
that the IFC examine the issue
of delayed Rush. He fought it
because he was genuinely
afraid of invading the IFC’s
turf, a legitimate fear, not
because of disinterest in the
plight of freshmen. —

Lang is not afraid to say what
he thinks, although he is afraid
of saying and doing too much.
He is a good representative,
though he might realize that
almost any concerned thought-
ful action by the E.C. is'likely to
be beneficial.

FRANK SMITH

 

 

\

Junior Representative

Frank Smith is serving his se-
cond term on the E.C. but has
not seemed to warm up to the
job. In fact, he probably dislikes
it. Smith has already announc-
ed that he will not run again.
His silence is sometimes con-
spicuous.

He has spoken on several im-
portant issues, however. Smith
brought up the subject of a
delayed fraternity Rush when
others on the Committee would
not. He is sometimes adamant
in defending the constitution (as
when he argued for rescinding

the two E.C, pub board
members). Smith has done a
good job following the SAB.
Unfortunately- these are the
exceptions and Smith rarely
enters debate. Perhaps, he can
be excused for judging the
debates useless, One recalls one
member’s speech to the Student
Control Ceutnittee last spring
about how the F.C, was like the
federal government and S.C.C.
was like fhie states. Smith
should realize that his com-
ments, and his actions, can only
improve thé Situation.

ERIC MYERS
Myers has-been a good presi-
dent, bringing experience and
hard work to the job, along with
a knowledge of how things were
run in the past that could be
taken too easily for granted.

The president is not skilled,
however, in parliamentarian’s
tricks and the meetings could
be run more efficiently. Myers
allows each E.C. member to

Myers discourages members
from speaking because they do
not want to prolong discussion.
He seems genuinely interested
in others’ points of view and is
very open to suggestions, even
if he sometimes is unable to
draw those views out of every-
one on the committee.

Myers labors to enact the con-
stitutional revisions bequeathed

paper, and he knows it. Myers

attempt (last year the E.C.
tried several times) robbed him
of an issue and a theme for the
year.

Past presidents of the E.C.
have been slick and talented
politicians, which Myers is not.
As a_ result, meetings are
sometimes poorly organized,
debates sometimes dull and
repetitive. and the questioning
of subcommittees sometimes
pointless and uninformative.

Myers is fair and selfless. He
is willing to do the work.

JIM AVERETT

Jim Averett as vice president
is in charge of the E.C.’s
finances, a job which is inten-
sive only during the budget
hearings. Averett will probably
contend with Bennett Ross for
the president’s spot in the up-
coming elections.

Averett has introduced no im-
portant legislation, but that
puts him in the majority. More,
however, is expected of the vice
president than of the average
member. Averett has a low in-
tensity approach to almost
cynical debate and enters often.
His comments are generally in-
formed and reveal that he has
many contacts with deans, ad-
ministrators, and law students.

Averett seems to perform his
office adequately.

BENNETT ROSS

Bennett Ross has less respon-
sibility than Averett but seems
to match him in accomplish-
ments. His comments during
debate have always been
enlightening and reflective of a
keen sense of the students’
needs. When the Executive
Committee rejected the budget

request of Intervarsity ‘Ct hris-
tian Fellowship, Ross:noted that
the question was not so mueh of
whether to support religious
propogation, but whether to
support alternative social
groups and _ non-fraternity
lifestyles. :

Ross served on a committee
that led to an important clari-
fication of the E.C.’s relation to
the Publications Board. The let-
ter Ross wrote on behalf of the
E.C. to the Inter-Fraternity
Council, asking the IFC to ad-
dress the problem of a delayed
rush, has been praised by other
representatives and was taken
well by the IFC

Ross has done much more
than the average secretary, and
done it much better than the
average E.C. member.

TRIPP BROWER
Senior Representative

Brower has asserted himselt
on the committee this year and
has performed well. He is effec-
tive in debate. Whereas last
year he was accused by the
Phi’s midterm report for doing
little because of his involve-
ment in the Muscular Dystro-
phy Dance, he has managed
both tasks well this year.

Brower has provided good
contacts to the students work-
ing on the Intellectual Sym-
posium (Focus), and has writ-
ten a letter to the Phi to drum
up support for the idea. Hope-
fully, his interest will see the
project through this its first
year.

is intelligent and has potential.

TED McQUISTON

Sophomore Representative

Ted McQuiston suffers in a
comparison with Hale, but the
former has done a good job, and
is unafraid to speak his mind.

 

 

 

John Vlahoplus began the
year vociferously but has turn-
ed into quite a good E.C.
member. He is effective in
debate and his clear reasoning
facilitates his work with the Stu-
dent Bar Association, to which
is an ad-hoc member.

Viahoplus has spent a good
deal of time researching the
judicial precedents for the
honor system and seems to
have more interest in the honor
system’s procedure than other
E.C. members. Whether this is
worthwhile or just so much
philosophical rabbit chasing,
one cannot tell. Vlahoplus’

November suggestion that a
subcommittee be formed to in-
vestigate improving the honor
system through upperclassman
orientations and other methods
shows that he can find practical ===
uses for his ideas.

 

The junior representative
seems to grasp the idea of reac- f
ting less to issues and acting
more on them. He spoke at
length to this effect during a

‘Stunt Man’ Is Quite A Feat

by Todd Jones

The Stunt Man deals with a
man wanted by the police.
While being chased, he
stumbles onto a movie set and
becomes a member of that
troupe to evade the police. An
interesting script with in-
teresting characters makes this
movie a winner.

Steve Raisbeck is being chas-
ed by the police. He evades
them and is walking alone on a

bridge when he sees an old
Mercedes Benz coming right at
him. He throws a piece of iron
at the car and it goes crashing
into the river below him. He
notices a helicopter with people
who saw him, so he runs away.
Later on, Raisbeck is on the
beach when the man in the
helicopter talks to him. The
man in the helicopter is actually
Peter O’Toole and he is direc-
ting a movie on location at the

Last Thursday night, Contct speaker F. Lee Bailey spoke to a pack-
ed Lee Chapel about America’s insufficient justice system. Con-
tact’s biggest name of the year cited political corruption, drug traf-
ficking, and robbery as issues that affect every American. To
remedy this, he proposes to outlaw the possession of more than $500

beach. The man in the ill-fated
car died, so O’Toole wants
Raisbeck to assume the dead
man’s identity so that O’Toole
won’t get in trouble with the
police.

Raisbeck has never done any
stunts, but is now the leading
man’s double in the picture.
Needless to say, he must at-
tempt some incredibly dan-
gerous stunts. O’Toole becomes
fascinated with the determina-
tion this man has, but feels that
he is being driven to the point
where he no longer cares for his

own safety
O’Toole is obsessed with what

crime Raisbeck has committed:
and allows him to continue on.
his job rather than be turned:
over to the police. Unfortunate’
ly, the stunts become more
dangerous until finally O’Toole
wants Raisbeck to drive a car
off the same bridge that the
original stunt man was killed
on.

Raisbeck gives a fine perfor-
mance. His character is
somewhat thin, but he develops
it well when he explains that the
police want him for attempted
murder. It ends up that the
murder was unintentional. You
see his character develop from
a man on the run to a profes-
sional.

O’Toole is tremendous. He
was nominated for Best Actor
at the Oscar ceremonies for his
performance in this movie and
it is easy to see why. O’Toole’s
character is melodramatic,
sensitive. He plays a somewhat
homosexual director who is
obsessed with making a
wonderful movie on war with a
deep statement. In the film,
everyone jumps the moment ~

O’Toole speaks. It is easy to see
why,

the leading lady about the inci-

cries not at the supposed

of honest shame.

The music is likewise perfect.
It adds to the film’s concept of a

carnivalistic theme is constant-

The Stunt Man is an excellent

not to be missed. He is dazzling

makes this film one of the best:

best in recent times.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Midterms

A good deal of our readership’s curiosity will be
satisfied this week after it reads the Phi’s review of
the Executive Committee. It seems that most of our
readers anticipate not excellent stories or insightful
analyses, but good old-fashioned roastings.

Well, for those who enjoy seeing the Executive
Committee squirm, we are likely to seem a failure.
Our assessment was not that the E.C. is full of losers,
but that it has done an adequate job. The only thing
we find wrong about this is the ambiguous meaning of
the term ‘‘adequate.’’

Mr. Webster defines adequate as ‘equal to the re-
quirement or occasion.”’ In the case of the E.C., this
seems true. The 1981-82 Executive Committee does a
satisfactory job on the matters brought before it. The
area in which the E.C. may be criticized is its lack of
initiative. To its credit, the E.C. has brought forth ac-
tion on several problems. Unfortunately, it seems to
discuss the problem and then sit back and wait for
another to occur. :

In retrospect, the E.C. may suffer from a quality
that plagues most governmental institutions —
mediocrity. Debate among committee members has
been mediocre at best. Initiative can be described as
mediocre. The group as a whole is intelligent but, un-
fortuantely, mediocre.

To dress down individual members seems to us to
be both pointless and unecessarily malicious. Certain-
ly some members have outperformed others. If the
committee’s performance to to improve, however, it
must be a group effort.

We are not labeling this year’s E.C. a failure. In ad-
dition, we do not want to commend it excessively. We
believe that it is an honest and diligent group of peo-

(Author’s Note: This was written for last week’s
Phi which, you may know, came out two days
after Groundhog Day. The Editors did not have
room for it, so they must be forgiven for killing the
timeliness which was intended. )

Does anybody not know that Tues., Feb. 2, was
Groundhog Day?

According to legend, you know, the rotund little
rodent is roused from. winter’s sleep on Feb. 2 of
each calendar year. He pops out of his hole and if
he sees his shadow it means six more weeks of
crummy weather, if he doesn’t, etc.

Now I always figured this was a localized set-up
— in other words the local groundhogs might not
see their shadows (as I presume they did not Tues-
day unless they only looked for a few minutes
around 10:30) meaning we’re home free even if,
say, a New Jersey woodchuck saw his shadow.
Well, no.

Apparently there is an official groundhog, with
an idiotic name I don’t remember, in some
obscure Pennsylvania town. It is the presence of
his shadow alone which determines
meteorological patterns for the nation.

This particiular animal’s emergence is a media
event. Instead of a hole in the ground, he lives ina
white box that resembles a portable dishwasher.
And he doesn’t crawl out quietly, let alone volun-
tarily, or with any dignity. A silly little man in a
top hat drags the terrified creature from the box
and holds him, prostrate, before a gawking crowd
of reporters. The man then announces that the lit-
tle beast saw his shadow and all that goes with
that. He didn’t point out tha the shadow was cast
with the help of glaring klieg lights.

So, even if a local groundhog saw no shadow, a
promise of awful weather pervades because some

 

Ground Hog Day, If You Care

Pennsylvania specimen called Woodrow C. Chuck
or something spent a few agonizing seconds dangl-
ing in front of T.V. cameras.

One wonders why, in the first place, a more no-
ble animal was not chosen to be forever associated
with the weather map. But, were it not for this
day, what possible distinction could be afforded
the groundhog? Unlike beavers they don’t have
neat tails, nor do they fell trees or do anything
even remotely useful. They don’t even bother to
wash their food properly like raccoons.
They are bulbous and unattractive, resembling
dirty, helium-inflated rats. And there is no grosser
roadside spectacle than a fat groundhog squashed
by a car, lying there to the delight only of buzzards
and the swarms of flies which accompany sum-
mer. Take Feb. 2 away from them and they’d be
immortalized only in the childhood ditty about
how much wood they can chuck if they could chuck
it.

Another question which pops to mind is who has
kept a track record of the beast’s accuracy?

My favorite Groundhog Day story was told bya
W&L professor to her class Tuesday. Seems her
five-year-old son, already steeped in groundhog
lore, came running to her saying ‘‘Oooh mommie,
come look at the groundhog in the front yard!”

How charming, the parent must have thought,
little Junior has spotted old Mr. Woodchuck out
there looking for his shadow. This is something
one reads about in Uncle Wiggly.

She then went to the window and watched with
the child as their dogs stood over the bloody corpse
of Mr. Woodchuck, whom they had savaged before
he could even see if he’d cast a shadow or not.

No moral to that tale - just senseless violence.
Enjoy the next six weeks.

 

 

 

 

 

W&L Men: Lawyers At Heart?

A survey of freshmen at
Washington and Lee University
indicates that more than 30 per-
cent of the Class of 1985 plans a
career in law.

Asked to indicate their
“probable career occupation,”
30.9 percent of the W&L
freshmen participating in the
survey selected the category
“lawyer (attorney) or judge.”

In recent years, law has been
the leading career choice
among W&L freshmen by a sig-
nificant margin. A year ago; for
instance, 29.9 percent of the
members of W&L’s freshman
class planned a career in law.

By comparison, 4.5 percent of
all freshman men taking part in

the nationwide survey indicated
law as a probable career while
11.1 percent of the freshman
men at private universities
chose law as a probable career.

The annual survey is part of
the Cooperative Institutional
Research Program conducted
jointly by the American Council
on Education and UCLA. The
survey is based on a question-
naire completed by freshmen at
368 institutions (73 two-year col-
leges, 250 four-year colleges,
and 45 universities) throughout
the nation, including Washing-
ton and Lee.

The second most popular
career choice of the W&L
freshmen was “business ex-
ecutive,’’ which was the choice
of 19.4 percent as compared
with 11.2 percent of all
freshman men and 10.8 percent
of freshman men at private
universities.

Third among career choices
was ‘‘physician,” selected as a
probable career by 14 percent of
the W&L freshmen compared

Bellini’s ‘Norma’ Aired By LUR

Vincenzo Bellini’s ‘‘Norma,” a tragic drama of illicit passion set
in Roman-occupied Gaul, will be broadcast live from the
Metropolitan Opera House at 1 p.m. Saturday over campus radio
station WLUR-FM.

The cast for the broadcast will feature Renta Scotto in the title
role of Norma, the Druid High Pr estess who has broken her

religious vows for love; Tatiana Troyanos as Adalgisa, a virgin of
the Temple; Placido Domingo as the Roman Pro-consul Pollione;
and John Cheek as Norma’s father, Oroveso. James Levine con-
ducts.

During the single intermission ‘Opera News on the Air,” Edward
Downes, quizmaster for ‘‘Texaco’s Opera Quiz”’ will discuss the
music and story of ‘‘Norma”’ with Warren Jones, an assistant con-
ductor at the Metropolitan Opera, at the piano.

Based on a play by Alexandre Soumet, ‘Norma’ embodies the
early nineteenth century’s spirit of romanticism. Bellini’s musical
writing is at its most dramatic and expressive, always moving the
story towards its final, inevitable tragedy.

with 4.0 percent of all freshman
men and 14.5 percent of fresh-
man men at private univer-
sities. That was followed, in
order, by ‘‘engineer’’ (7.1 per-
cent) and “‘writer or journalist”’
(4.9 percent). Of the W&L
freshmen surveyed, 6.6 percent
indicated that they were
undecided about a career.

Asked in the survey to in-
dicate reasons ‘‘noted as very
important”’ in their decision to
attend college, 81.7 percent of
the W&L freshmen said they
hoped to ‘‘gain a general educa-
tion’’ while 78 percent said their
reason was to “prepare for
graduate school.”’

As for their choice of

' Washington and Lee, in par-

ticular, 89.8 percent indicated

Court Rules W&L SNU Debts

Liability Of SNU House Corp. |

by Bill Roberts

In a General District Court
hearing Wed., Jan. 27, Judge
Joseph E. Hess ruled that the
$488.62 still owed to Green
Valley Rent Alls by the now
defunct Sigma Nu fraternity is
the liability of the Sigma Nu
House Corp. ’

Green Valley Rent Alls was
suing the former president of
the fraternity, William
Dederick, for $488.62 in rental
fees. Dederick had signed a ren-
tal contract for some floor-
sanding equipment in Septem-
ber, 1981, and the fraternity has
not paid the bill.

Judge Hess ruled that
Dederick had signed the rental
contract as an officer of a cor-
poration and could not be held
liable for debts incurred by the
fraternity. Judge Hess ruled
that the Sigma Nu House Corp.
is legally responsible for the
chapter’s debts.

The Sigma Nu House Corp.
acts as a legal umbrella for the
chapter. The House Corp. holds
the insurance policy and mort-
gage on the fraternity building.

According to the executive
director of the Sigma Nu Na-
tional Fraternity, Maurice E.
Littlefield, approximately
$8,500 is still owed to local
businesses which had extended
credit tothe chapter.

The national organization,
which has its headquarters in
Lexington, holds the charter of
every Sigma Nu chapter in the
country.

Littlefield said that the na-
tional fraternity has been pay-
ing the chapter’s debts to
Washington and Lee. The
University made several loans
to the chapter in the past. These
loans are still current, and the
national fraternity has been
covering the payments for the
chapter. But the national frater-
nity cannot pay the chapter’s
debts to local businesses.

The coordinator of fraternity
affairs at Washington and Lee,
Dan Murphy, said, “The legal
entity responsible for those
debts is the house corporation.”

But the president of the
Sigma Nu House Corp., Jay
Denny, said, ‘“There seems to
be some difference of opinion
here.”

“‘T do not think the house cor-
poration is responsible for those
debts,” said Denny.

Denny said that he would be
meeting with Littlefield to
decide on a strategy for collect-
ing from the former chapter
members. According to Denny,
the house corporation and the
national fraternity are planning
to hold the former chapter
members responsible for the
debts to local businesses.

The problem is that the
chapter’s financial records
were stolen on Nov. 12, 1981.
The former chapter treasurer,
John Solitario, said that he had
kept the books in his apartment
at 114 E. Nelson St. Solitario
noticed that the accounts were
missing and contacted Dan
Murphy about the disap-
pearance the following day.

This occurred only 24 hours

before a fire caused damage to .

the basement and first floor of
the fraternity building. Accord-
ing to Littlefield, State Arson
Bureau investigators have
determined that the cause of the
fire was arson.

Littlefield said that since the
records of which former mem-
bers still owe the chapter were
stolen, they will now have to
Civide the $8,500 between the
students who were active
members at the time the debts
were incurred. Although the
records are missing, it is known
that several of the members
were not paying their dues.

“Once we have determined
exactly how much is owed, we
will determine who was on cam-

sibility.

pus last year and divide it into .
equal shares,” said Littlefield. +4
But he added, “It is unfor-
tunate, because now these peo- =|
ple who were paid up will have |
to bear an unequal share of the,
burden.”’

Solitario said, ‘‘I am not going
to do anything about it.’’ He
said that the general feeling
among the members is that
they are not responsible for the
debts.

‘Those who were paid up feel
they do not owe any more
money, and those who were not
are not ready to admit that they
owe anything,”’ said Solitario.

The Sigma Nu fraternity was
placed on probation last spring
because of financial irrespon-

The University prohibited
members from living or eating
in the fraternity building. Final-
ly, on Nov. 10, 1981, the Univer-
sity withdrew recognition of the
chapter.

clinch the victory. ‘‘We took
away their transition game,”’
said Canfield. ‘“‘The only way to
win in February—both home
and away—is to play good team
defense.”’

Eppes, who had dished out
nine assists the entire season,
contributed four against Lynch-
burg, and two guards, Spears
and Bond, pulled down four re-
bounds apiece. Graves led the

Generals’ attack with 15 points
and Billy Yates added 14.

All five W&L starters scored
within two points of each other,
Eppes leading the charge with
14, Yates adding 13 and Spears,
and Hanson 12, in the 75-60 win
over Catholic University Thurs-
day night in the Warner Center.
“The balanced scoring is an in-
dication of some offensive effec-
tiveness,”” commented Can-
field.

Law Colloquium Held On Aircraft Disasters

The question of which state’s

inflation was the biggest
domestic problem; 67.6 percent
felt high school grading is too
easy; and, 67.9 percent said
students should help evaluate

faculty.

Asked to indicate their
‘political orientation,”’ 51.8 per-
cent selected ‘‘conservative,”’
29.6 percent ‘‘middle-of-the-
road,’ and 14.4 percent

“‘liberal.”’ The W&L freshmen
thereby characterized them-
selves aS more conservative
than their counterparts at other
colleges and universities.

For instance, data from
freshman men at all other col-
leges showed that 55 percent
selected ‘‘middle-of-the-road’’

quium included Willis Reese,
professor of law at Columbia
University and author of the
most widely used volume on
conflict of law issues; Andreas
Lowenfeld, an authority on air-
craft law and professor at the
New York University law

 

and 18.1 percent chose
“Jiberal.”’ At private univer-
sities, 49.5 percent of the
freshman men were ‘‘middle-
of-the-road,”’ 28.8 percent were
“conservative,” and 23.5 per-
cent were ‘‘liberal.”’

As for their expectations of
college, 67.4 percent estimated
the chances are “‘very good”
that they will be satisfied with
college; 13 percent said they

-will likely change their career

choice; 66.3 percent said they
expect to find a job ina ‘‘prefer-
red field’; 57.6 percent said
they are likely to join a social
fraternity; and, 50.8 percent ex-
pect to make at least a B
average.

 

Fencing

(continued from page 5)

Fencing was a varsity sport
at W&L until 1942 when it was
dropped during the World War
II period. E.S. Humphreys,
Business Manager of the Lex-
ington News-Gazette and Head
Coach of the VMI fencing team,
revived the fencing program at
WA&L in 1976.

Commenting on the nature of
the sport, Hepler, a_ senior,
Says, “It takes many years to
become totally reflexive. It’s a
game of physical chess, think-
ing a couple of moves ahead of

your opponent and planning

your defensive strategy.”

This weekend the fencing club
will compete in the Virginia
Cup, which features action be-
tween six teams, all from the
state of Virginia.

“‘We’re hoping for about a -

fourth place finish,’’ said
Hepler. ‘“There will be several
schools that bring teams and
who will have a lot of discipline.
However, we will have several
individuals that finish high in
the state.”

SOAS Is Available

by Bruce Jones

An exciting and challenging
opportunity awaits one or two
W&L students interested in
African or Asian studies.

The School of Oriental and
African Studies in London,
probably the world’s very finest
school for African studies and
renowned for Asian studies, will
accept a few students, selected
by W&L, for junior year abroad
or postgraduate programs.

SOAS, part of the University
of London, is conveniently
located only two blocks from
the British Museum and a short
walk from Covent Garden, the
two main opera houses, and the
West End theaters.

Students at SOAS may take
introductory or highly special-
ized courses in fields of their
choice; African and Asian
politics, economics, geography,
history, sociology, law, music,
etc. are offered. Intensive train-
ing is available in dozens of
African and Asian languages,
among them Arabic, Bengali,

Korean, Sanskrit, Shona, Thai
and Zulu.

The SAS library boasts the
world’s most comprehensive
collection of printed materials
in Oriental and African studies ;
this resource is supplemented
by an expert faculty. The stu-
dent body itself, drawn from
more than 80 countries, is also a

wonderful source of _ inter-
cultural education for the
visiting student.

A program of study at SOAS

would be of great value to a |

W&L student interested either
in gaining an advantage over
the competition for foreign. af-
fairs, international business or

academic careers, or in
expanding his_ intellectual
horizons.

The cost, inclusive of room,
board, tuition and some vaca-
tion and spending money, is
$5,500 per term. Any one in-
terested should please contact
Dr. Minor Rogers or Dr. H. P.
Porter, Jr.

school; Lee Kreindler, a New
York attorney who has rep-
resented plaintiffs in aircraft
disaster cases; and, George
Tompkins, a New York attorney
who has represented airlines in
the cases.

Frederic L. Kirgis Jr.,
director of the Lewis Law
Center, coordinated the event,
which involved a series of infor-
mal roundtable discussions as
well as a two-hour session in
which the participants were
joined by members of the
Washington and Lee law school
faculty.

Reese presented a paper that
served as the basis for the
discussions. In his paper, Reese
proposed that plaintiffs be
allowed to select which state’s
laws they want to apply in cases
against airlines.

“As it now stands, the court
has the choice of which state’s
laws to apply, and the law is

~ very, very unclear on the sub-

ject,” explained Kirgis.

“Generally, everyone agreed
with Mr. Reese that the plaintiff
ought to have a choice. But
there was considerable dis-
agreement in the group over
which choices should be
available.”

Some of the options, ex-
plained Kirgis, would be the
laws of the home state of the
plaintiff, of the state where the
aircraft was manufactured, of
the principle place of business
of the airline, of the state from
which the airplane departed, or
of the state to which the
airplane was bound.

“Tt is an extremely com-

plicated situation,” Kirgis add-
ed. ‘In the case of the recent

Air Florida tragedy, for in-
stance, which state’s laws
should be applied in the cases?
The airplane departed from a
Virginia airport, but its crash
site is apparently in the District
of Columbia, The airline is
headquartered in Florida. But
you might also consider the
state in which the aircraft is
manufactured as well as the in- -
dividual states of the
passengers.”

Two of the participants in last
week’s colloquium are directly

_ involved in the litigation that

has already begun over the Air
Florida disaster — Tompkins -
represents the airline while
Kreindler represents some of
the plaintiffs.
