Merchants
Concerned

By Thefts

by Tom Baker

Most people think that
speeding, public drunkeness
and noise violations are the only
infractions of the law that
Washington & Lee students are
ever involved in. Shoplifting,
however, is becoming a concern
for Lexington merchants as
well as the Commonwealth At-
torney’s office.

According to Robert Candea,
president of the Lexington
Retail Merchants Association
and manager of Spanky’s, shop-
lifting by W&L students is
becoming an_ increasingly
serious problem for local
storeowners.

Candea said that the situation
usually involves a student who
is drunk, without cash, or look-
ing for something exciting to do.
The shoplifter will conceal
something of little value and try
to walk out with it. Candea has
already had two such instances
take place at Spanky’s this year
as opposed to no such instances
last year.

In both instances Candea let
the students involved go but did
‘put a nice scare into them.”’
Candea, as well as other local
merchants, is hesitant of filing
charges for several reasons.
Candea and others recognize
that students, who tend not to
consider the implications of
their actions fully, have a lot to
lose by a petty larceny convic-
tion.

Storekeepers are often unwill-
ing to prosecute because of the
bad publicity, the lost work
time and the lost revenue a stu-
dent, who shops frequently at a
store, can generate. Candea
added that local merchants are

- Vassar Clements to Fiddle
Away In Homecoming Concert

by John Wells

Renowned fiddler Vassar
Clements will open Washington
& Lee’s 1981 Homecoming with
a concert in Warner Gym-
nasium on Friday, Oct. 9. The
show, which will begin at 8:30,
marks Clements’ first Lexing-
ton appearance since 1976.

SAB Co-chairman John Mar-
tin said admission to thé con-
cert will be free for W&L
students and their dates, but
that proper identification (stu-
dent I.D. or library card) must
be shown at the door. He said
that tickets for unescorted
females and others not from the
W&L community will be
available at $3 each.

There will be three ticket win-
dows and local policemen on
hand, according to Martin. All
these measures are being taken
to eliminate problems like those
experienced in the same loca-
tion at last year’s John Prine
concert, when scores of non-
W&L students got choice seats
for nothing.

Clements will be preceded
onstage by John Proussett of
the Proussett Dart Band
(‘‘Amnesia,” ‘County Line’)
who will open the show.

For a decade Vassar
Clements has been widely
respected for his musical talent
and versatility, and has been
called by some ‘“‘the premier
fiddler of the world.’’ He has
either performed and/or
recorded with practically
everyone in the business from
The Grateful Dead to The
Boston Pops. Even a partial
listing is impressive: The
Allman Brothers, J.J. Kale, The
Byrds, Paul McCartney, Linda
Ronstadt, The Band, Kris
Kristofferson, John Prine, The

Marshall Tucker Band, Steve
Martin, Bonnie Raitt, Elvin
Bishop, Maybelle Carter - and
ee Cody, to name a
ew.

Clements plays _ bluegrass,
blues, jazz, rock and traditional
melodies and was largely in-
fluenced in his early years by
the big band sound of the 1940s.
He told a reporter in 1979: “I

perform for Homecoming.

want people to like what I play.
I put myself in the audience’s
position and think of what. I
want to hear. Everyone’s tastes
are different. So, I want to play
it all.”

Born in Florida in 1932,
Clements never had a fiddle
lesson and left home at the age
of 13 to pursue a career in
music. His childhood dream
came true in 1949 when he
played at the Grand Old Opry in
Nashville, the country music
mecca. That appearance was
with Bill Monroe, and in 1950
Vassar made his first record as
a member of Monroe’s Blue-
grass Boys.

He spent years traveling back

and forth between Nashville
and his home in Orlando, and
was employed in a variety of
capacities. He moved to Nash-
ville in 1969 and in 1971 was ask-
ed to record on the Nitty Gritty
Dirt Band’s classic ‘‘Will The
Circle Be Unbroken.’’ He was
an overnight success, with im-
mediate offers for recording
sessions and guest appearances
with other musicians.

“The Dirt Band and John
Hartford were so important to
my career,’’ Clements said in
an interview. ‘“‘They’re the first
ones who let me play what I
wanted to play.”’

Hartford, a country song-
writer and performer, gave
Clements his unique fiddle nine
years ago. The fiddle is said by
the Smithsonian Institute to be
more than 450 years old and
probably crafted by Italian gyp-
sies. Vassar likes it; on the road
most of each year, he considers
himself a gypsy.

NUMBER 3

Holds
Marathon
Session

by Todd Smith

Two a.m. had passed when
the Student Activities Board
made its budget requests to the
Executive Committee. Some on
the E.C. had been drinking cof-
fee and cola since 6:30 p.m.,
some on the SAB had been
drinking bee’ in the Cockpit,
and no one looked very good.

Fifteen organizations — pre-
sented funding requests to the
E.C. during the eight hour ses-
sion Monday night. Over $92,000
was allocated in a budget that
has yet to be completed, revised
and approved.

The E.C. set the figure
of $39,000 as the preliminary
SAB budget. This amounts to
about 42 percent of the night's
allocations.

Of the SAB allocation, $13,000
is stipulated for use by thx
University Center Committee
Chaired by Bob Schmidt, th
UCC arranges Cockpit enter
tainment. Schmidt had _ re-
quested three thousand dollars
more than he got, but still was
given tentatively three thou-
sand more than last year.

The rest of the SAB was
allocated $26,000, which is
$13,000 below their request, and
about equal to last year’s
budget.

Pressure from the Fire Mar-
shall has forced this year’s Fan-
cy Dress Ball into the new Gym,
according to SAB Co-Chairman
Blake Witherington.

Fancy Dress will therefore be
open to Alumni and guests of
W&L students in addition to the
student body.

The Bands will be announced
as soon as possible to draw
alumni and news coverage. In-

W&L Drops Centre

by Dale Park

Trailing 14-0 after only one
period of play, the Washington
& Lee varsity football team
recovered for a 24-14 victory
over the Centre College Col-
onels last Saturday on Wilson
Field.

A crowd of 1,864 watched Cen-
tre strike early in the first
quarter on a 60-yard touchdown
pass and again as time expired
in the quarter on a one-yard
scoring run.

“Their 7-0) lead didn’t bother
me so much because they got it
on a long pass,”’ offered head

coach Gary Fallon. ‘People |
tend to make mistakes against |
long passes. What worried me |
was that our defense seemed |
unable to stop them on their |
next scoring drive.”’
W&L retaliated late in the se- |
cond quarter when sophomore |
quarterback Al Paradise hit |
junior wide-receiver Phil |
Hrabar with a 22-yard touch-
down pass that cut Centre’s
lead to 14-7.
Yet the key play in the game |
occurred late in the third
period. After moving deep into

A team of biomedical in-
vestigators, including Washing-
ton & Lee University psychol-
ogy professor H.E. King, has
been awarded a $226,000 grant
to support its continued
research into the behavioral
consequences of hypertension.

The three-year grant was
made by the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute. King
and two co-principal scientists
from the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine will
use the grant to continue their
detailed investigation of
changes in behavior which may
result from marked and persis-
tent elevation of the cerebral
blood pressure.

“There is no more important
health consideration facing our
nation today than maintaining
appropriate levels of blood
pressure,”’ said King, who join-
ed the W&L faculty in 1977.

“With the varied means for
effective treatment and control
now available, the remaining
problem is mostly educational:
better understanding by the
general public about the need
for carefully monitoring blood
pressure, from the first sign of
unusual elevation, and an in-
creased understanding by the

biomedical community about
all aspects of the hypertensive
condition, including those
behavioral components that are
related to both cause and ef-
fect.”

King and his colleagues at
Pitt have centered their atten-
tion on the effect hypertension
has on brain function as it
becomes manifest in behavior.

Although a great deal of at-
tention has been given to life-
stress as a contributing cause in
hypertensive disorder, there
has been relatively little ex-
ploration made of the possible
consequences of the altered
physiological state for behav-
ior. Since the brain is one of the
three bodily organs, along with
the heart and kidney, most like-
ly to be affected by persistent
blood pressure elevations, this
team of investigators elected to
center its attention on brain
function.

The team’s initial studies,
made of men and women with
very recently diagnosed mild
hypertension, have been able to
demonstrate a characteristic
pattern of altered behavior in
sensory-perceptual, psycho-
motor, and cognitive function-
ing when such patients are ask-

ed to perform under an imposed
“load” or mild stress. Accor-
ding to King, the situation is
best likened to the use of tread-
mill-pacing for probing the
details of cardiac or respiratory
function under a mild and con-
trolled work load.

Dr. Alvin Shapiro, head of the
Hypertension Clinic at Pitts-
burgh’s School of Medicine, will
be responsible for patient selec-
tion and all medical aspects of
the experimental program.

Drs. King and Robert E.
Miller, both research psycholo-
gists with long experience in
evaluating relationships _bet-
ween the human brain and be-
havior, will conduct the behav-
ioral research.

The three investigators have
been associated for many years
at the Pitt medical school. Since
joining the W&L faculty, Dr.
King has changed his appoint-
ment at the University of Pitts-
burgh to that of adjunct pro-
fessor. He will continue to be in
residence in Pittsburgh during
the summer months and will
make periodic on-site visits to
the research program on week-
ends throughout the academic
year in order to supervise the
collection of behavioral test
data.

Dr. King indicated that it is
likely the Washington & Lee
computer facilities will assist in
making an analysis of the data
to be gathered during the three-
year period of active study.

The Other Side
Of Randy Mac

Randolph-Macon Woman's Col-
lege
Lynchburg, Va.

Mark Smith ‘83 is one mink
down the road almost every
night of the week. He does it to
keep up his grades.

The only male exchange stu-
dent at Randolph-Macon, Smith
is often asked if he leads the
Sultan’s life.

Of the surrounding girls’
schools, R-MWC shares a
reputation of being the most in-
telligent with Hollins. Yet,
every mink knows that Randy
Mac girls are majoring in
French or Art History, and can-
not converse above the Skiing,
Travel and Tennis level.

Sometimes, minks
think.

Macon has plenty to teach
W&L. ‘‘They have what I would
call a sense of community,”
says Smith. ‘‘They aren’t just a
group of divergent people.’’

Cookie Cutter Atmosphere

The Yale Daily's Insider's
Guide compares R-MWC to a
girl scout camp, with a student
body molded by identical cookie
cutters. Others would credit the
school-girl traditions with the
sense of unity that pervades the
725 woman campus.

One tradition is the Rain Peo-
ple. Smith was startled to see
women in hoods and black robes
chanting ‘‘like an _ occult
chapter’’ and marching across
the front campus, as they do at
midnight after every rainy day.

Secret Societies are also
traditional. Last year, Delta Mu
dressed up the parking lot with
Used Car Lot signs and flags,
soaping prices on every wind-
Shield. The year before, every-
one’s toothbrush was stolen.
The year before that they
advertised the campus for sale
in the Washington Post.

‘When you have a school this
small, students with so many in-
terests, and such a big work-
load, traditions help to keep up
school spirit,” says Valerie
Sands ‘83.

“Sometimes you ‘just don’t
want to fool with it—‘Please go
away!’ But it contributes to the
continuity of this school, its

Sands returns to R-MWC,
after spending her sophomore
year at Florida State University
in Tallahassee. ‘(To return) is
to trade away a Social life for
academics,” said Sands.

“The academics at FSU are
totally beneath what they are
here. I would go to class and not
get anything out of it.”’

‘Professors here like to teach
very much, said Sands. ‘‘They
learn your name, make you
read, and teach you to think.”’

‘‘We are sisters.”’

Without sororities, the women
organize by dorm. Each dorm
elects officers; each floor sends
representatives to the Student
Legislature. They have a Stu-
dent Activities Board and an
Executive Committee.

With the inclusion of the
President and select faculty on
the E.C. may encumber student
autonomy, it gives the students
representation in curriculum
changes.

“It’s like we are all sisters,”
comments Renee Hansard ‘84,
secretary of Bell Dorm. Par-
ties, dances, and lectures are
arranged by the dorms.

One of the reasons for enroll-
ing only women is the idea that
women can be taught to be
assertive if men are removed
from the classroom.

“If you can’t function with
men in the real world, then just
bag it,”’ says Barbet Rucker ‘82.
Rucker has just returned from
a college-sponsored year in
Spain despite misgivings about
Randoph-Macon.

“T think the idea of —
tion of the sexes is wrong,...
leads to unhealthy sida.
ships,” states Rucker.

Although ‘‘the academics are
good and the campus is beauti-
ful,’’ Rucker dislikes the social |
life. ‘I think it’s immature to |
run to (W&L and the other col- |
leges in the area) every |
weekend. I know of some people |
who go up there just to laugh at
the guys.”’

 

‘A Healthy Atmosphere”’
President Robert Spivey says
he hears few complaints from
students who feel cloistered.

Review:

by Todd Jones

This week, I was supposed to
see Eye of the Needle, starring
Donald Sutherland. However,
the Lyric tricked me by delay-
ing the arrival of this movie by
a week. I figured not too many
people would be interested in a
second review of Arthur, which
is still playing at the State, so I
took in the Lyric’s current ‘ter-
ror thriller,’ Night School. I feel
I cannot fully explain my reac-
tions to this film without first
explaining the circumstances
under which I viewed it. Upon
entering the theatre, I could not
help but assume that I had ar-
rived early, for the theatre was
empty. However, shortly after I
sat down, the lights dimmed. I

treated to a private showing.
This was advantageous, as the
movie was incredibly bad.
Given the size of the audience,
though, I did not feel the least
bit embarrassed for laughing
instead of shrieking in terror.

Night School stars Rachel
Ward and Drew Snyder, who, if
their performances continue at
this level, will no doubt be box-
office smashes by the year 2010.
Drew, a Harvard grad working
on the Boston police force (as
all Harvard men do these
days), spends most of his time
wearing preppy clothes and
driving a BMW. Along with ex-
plaining the inner motives of
the killer and expressing his
logical views on life (as any
Harvard alum would), he also
curses, to show us that under-
neath his cultured upbringing is
the rough, tough individual who
wants to spend his life in-
vestigating grisly murders in
Boston (and they say Ivy
Leaguers can’t get jobs! ).

Rachel Ward (not a Harvard
graduate) is an exchange stu-
dent at a small girls’ college on
Beacon Hill. How she found this
small girls’ school so far away
from her native England is a
mystery in itself, but why she
only takes night classes there is
totally inexplicable. She is in-
deed English, which explains
why one sentence in every ten
could not be understood by the
audience (in this case, John and
myself).

The plot involves the fact that
girls at Rachel's school are
dropping like flies. About every
ten minutes another coed is
slashed in the neck and her
head is dropped in some sort of

my personal favorite takes
place at a diner. You’ve heard
of Chicken in a Basket? How
about : waitress’ head in beef
stew?

Naturally, one tries to guess
the killer’s identity. The pro-
ducers help out by providing an
abundance of clues so the
average third grader could
work it out. All the victims are
taught by a certain prof. This
prof fools around with all his
students. He is obsessed with
headhunting. Rachel, the pro-
fessor’s room-mate and _ lab
assisstant, accompanied him to
Africa to look at headhunting
tribes. (How she did this while
taking night classes is unex-
plained.) Rachel is carrying the
professor’s child. The head-
hunters in Africa kill only those
who threaten them. I won’t give
the solution to this whodunit, as
only a Harvard man on the
Boston force could get this one.
The film is rated R, so there has
to be some flesh. We see Rachel
taking a shower, and a couple of
other girls undressing. Another
scene shows the school’s head-
mistress in a lesbian affair with
a student. All this may cause a
ten-year-old to breathe heavily.
John and I yawned. A very poor
attempt at exploitation (I have
always wondered, though, why
full-length mirrors always
steam up right at the waist in
these movies...).

Commentary:

A Shot In The Arm

by John Cleghorn

It was a happy W&L bench in
the closing minutes of the vic-
tory over Centre last Saturday
and had any players turned
around, they would have been
surprised to see a full stadium
of fans that were almost as
pleased. The victory gave both
the Generals and the fans a
much needed shot in the arm.
The team on the field Saturday
was a good example of what the
Generals are capable of doing
this season, if they can steer
clear of their past.

Welcome to Lexington Al
Paradise. To an offense that
sputtered in the past games
Paradise was a spark plug that
gave the Generals fine tuning.
Running the option with Chris
Cavalline, Paradise gained as
many yards as the outstanding
tailback and provided a threat
that gave the General offense
an extra aspect. Paradise also
throws the ball with a fine touch
completing 12 of 27.

Tailback Cavalline was also a
cornerstone in Saturday’s win.
Coming off a 156 yard game last
week at Emory & Henry Caval-
line hit holes with the prover-
bial “‘wreckless abandon.’’ Just
when Centre might have him
keyed in the backfield he slip-
ped out for receptions down
field. Eighty yards rushing and
85 receiving is a pretty well

rounded day, not to mention
four punts with an average of
38.5.

You had to love Coach Gary
Fallon’s play calling. On two
big drives he went on fourth and
little. The option, a more open
passing attack, using running
backs as receivers, and fewer
dives make the Generals a
much more entertaining team
to watch.

The two outstanding single
play awards go to Phil Hrabar
and Marty Thomas. Hrabar
committed an arial theft in the
end zone to bring down W&L’s
second touchdown. And nobody
was more surprised than
Thomas when a squibbed kick
drove into his gut five yards off
the line, but he quickly
recovered and returned it 35
yards to set up a field goal.

Before most had left their
bloody mary partys for the
game, the defensive secondary
had gotten burned down the

But the Generals tightened up
for the remainder of the game
holding strong with starting
linebacker John McKee out tor
much of the game.

The Generals showed their
stuff Saturday and will have
even more where that came
from. Keep it up Generals, you
earned a lot of fans.

Injured Soccer Team Loses

by John Harrison

The Washington & Lee soccer
team lost its first game of the
young season last Saturday
when it dropped a 3-2 decision to
Haverford.

Following the game, head
coach Rolf Piranian made an
announcement that could test
the team’s ability to adjust to
some changes. ‘‘We’ve suffered
a number of injuries lately, so
we will be using more of our
younger players and switching
some of the experienced
players to new positions. The
team we put on the field at
Davidson (Saturday) and here
next Tuesday against Hamp-
den-Sydney will look a lot dif-
ferent than the one we had on
our opening game. Both games
will be a good test for us, as a
result of the adjustments to the
line-up we’ve been forced to
make. Our success now depends
on the players’ adjustments to
their new roles.

Starting time for the Hamp-
den-Sydney game will be 3:30.

The score of the Haverford
game does not indicate how the
Fords dominated play. With the
exception of the situations in
which Roland Simon scored the
Generals’ goals, W&L was un-
able to keep the ball in the
Haverford end of the field for
more than a minute at a time.
Simon started the scoring at
15:00 of the first half when he
beat the diving keeper after a
scramble in the goal mouth. He
went on to score the final goal of
the day with less than two

Ruggers Begin Fall
Season Coachless

by Dan Tatum

Following a .500 season last
year and the departure of their
coach, W&L’s rugby club will
sport several new players and a
new player-coach.

Junior Todd Alexander has
taken the place of last year’s

coach, Larry Babbits. “Babbits

got the team on its feet, but we
shouldn’t miss him too badly,”
said Alexander.

Alexander explained his posi-
tion as player-coach by saying
that rugby is essentially a
player’s game, not a coach’s
game.

The W&L squad started last
year’s season with two tough
losses to U.N.C.-Greensboro
and the Greensboro Rugby Club
and followed with two close
losses to U.N.C.-Chapel Hill and
N.C. State. W&L finished the
season on an upswing, however,
with three victories over the
New River Club, the Cape Fear
Club of Wilmington, and the
Winchester Rugby Club.

The only team in its division
that W&L did not beat was
Hampden-Sydney.

Several of the experienced
players who were injured in the
spring are playing football this
fall, so the club will be starting

several inexperienced players
this season.

W&L’s opening game will be a
week from this Saturday
against U.N.C.-Greensboro.

Polo Team
Goes 7-1

by G. Bruce Potter

The Washington & Lee water
polo team improved its record
to 7-1 while winning the W&L In-
vitational last weekend.

The Generals scored victories
over James Madison (10-1),
Lynchburg (17-2) and the
Northern Virginia Water Polo
Club (11-7). The latter match-up
proved to be a tough test for the
Generals as they rallied from a
5-1 first quarter deficit.

Erik Peterson and Mike Ber-
not paced W&L with 11 and ten
goals, respectively. Goalie, An-
dy Gates made 13 saves and
Kevin Kadesky stopped 11
shots.

W&L opens play in the Slip-
pery Rock tournament tomor-
row and will have a chance to
avenge their 13-5 loss to the
Rockets suffered in the cham-
pionship finale of the Fall
Classic.

Pittman

_ Impressive

by Bob Halorin

Freshmen otien rise im-
mediately to the top of a cross
country team, more so than
other iam sports. Of the four
freshr.en on the W&L squad,
Ben Lipscomb, Chris Smith,
Steve Whetzle, and Frank Pitt-
man, perhaps Pittman has the
brightest future.

Frank was captain of his aigh
chool team for three con-
secutive years and, as a junior,
led unein to their first’ Georgia
stat. championship. He placed
firs. in his coun'v three times
and won the regionals tv: ice. In
his three state appearances, he
‘ecorded finishes of fifth, third
and second places.

Frank’s competitive laurels
are not limited to just high
school meets. On the A.A.U.
(Amateur Athletic Union) level,
he placed sixth and second
iwice in the state of Georgia. In
his senior year, as captain of
the A.A.U. team, Frank came in
31xin in the Southeast and 84th
in the Nationals.

It appears that, with
{freshmen runners the caliber of
Frank Pittman, Washington &
Lee's cross country team has
the foundation for successfu,
seasons in the years to come.

Paradise, Cavalline Lead W&L Victory Over Centre

(continued from page 1)

W&L territory, Centre’s drive
stalled. The Colonels tried a 30-
yard field goal only to have the
ball shank off the kicker’s foot
and into the arms of W&L’s
Marty Thomas. The junior de-
fensive back raced to the Centre
38-yard line. Six plays later
junior kicker Bill Devine booted
a 30-yard field goal to narrow
the Colonels’ lead to 14-10.

From this point, the W&L
defense dominated Centre while
the Generals’ offense came
alive.

Paradise, making his second
straight start for the Generals,
led his team in two fourth-
quarter scoring drives.
Paradise himself scored on a
six-yard run early in the final
period, while junior tailback
Chris Cavalline capped the final
W&L scoring drive with a se-
ven-yard scamper in the final
two minutes.

Paradise and Cavalline con-
tinued to be the two big offen-
sive weapons for the Generals.

Paradise not only passed for
127 yards and one touchdown
but led his team in rushing with
81 yards and another score.

“Paradise is still making
some mistakes, but he is pro-

ducing and unless something
drastic happens, he’s our man
at quarterback,”’ said Fallon.

Cavalline followed Paradise
in the ground game with 80
yards and a touchdown and also
led his team in pass-receiving
with a game-high 85 yards.
Cavalline also averaged 40-
yards as the W&L punter.

“I spoke to Centre’s coaches
after the game,’’ offered
Fallon, ‘‘and they had nothing
but praise for Cavalline. They
had geared their defense for his
running game, but they hadn’t
counted on his pass-catching
ability.”

W&L rolled up 330 total yards
on the afternoon while failing to
commit a turnover.

Next Saturday, the Generals
will put their 2-1 record on the
line as they travel to Ashland,
Virginia, to take on ODAC rival
Randolph-Macon.

Last year the Generals lost
14-10 to the Wasps. This year,
maintained Fallon, W&L will
see a virtually new R-M-C team
“because they graduated so
many people. They’ve also had
two weeks to prepare for us, so
they’ll be ready.”’

Game time is 2 p.m. on Day
Field.

Harriers Win Clash Of Washingtons

by Rick Swagler

This past weekend, the an-
nual ‘‘Battle of the Washing-
tons’ took place in Fredericks-
burg, Virginia, at Mary Wash-
ington College. The ‘‘Battle’’ is
a cross-country meet in which
Washington & Lee, Mary
Washington College and
Washington College compete.
This year, Washington & Lee
won with a score of 22 points —
the best possible score is 15.

W&L had six men in the top
ten, and of these six; first, four-
th, and seventh place all went to
freshmen, Sophomore Paul
Chapman, in his first cross-
country meet ever, finished
eighth with a time of 29:42 over
the five mile course. Chapman
says he “‘hopes to improve”’ but
adds that “‘the top five are very
tough.”’

Freshman Frank Pittman,
the overall meet winner, turned
in a surprisingly fast 28:33, just
edging out Angus McBryde, a
sophomore, in second place.
McBryde had a time of 28:34.

Pittman said that he surprised
himself with his performance
and after he took the lead at
about the two mile mark, he
‘ust cruised.”’

Both Chapman and McBryde
were highly complimentary of
the freshmen. Une man to
watch among these freshmen is
Steve Whetzle. In this, his first
collegiate meet, Whetzle finish-
ed an impressive fourth place.
Chapman commented that
Whetzle was extremely tough
mentally, going so far as to
compare him with teammate
Angus McBryde, also known for
his mental toughness.

Coach Dick Miller, when ask-
ed about this Saturday’s meet
against Roanoke College and
Norfolk State, said that his
team is “training for the
Roanoke meet, but we’re look-
ing down the road to the ODAC
Championships.”’ Miller com-
mented that ‘‘this is the most
together team we've had in a
long time and on any given day,
anyone could be the leader.”
Chapman concurred with his

     

  

 
     
 

463-9152

  

coach’s assessment, saying
“the reason we did so well
Saturday was because we ran in
a pack.”

Two other runners deserving
recognition are Chris Smith, a
freshman, who finished seventh
and is showing promise accord-
ing to his teammates, and John
Kelefant, a junior. At Satur-
day’s meet, Kelefant acquired a
‘stitch’, a pain in the side or
abdomen, which is more of a
nuisance than other injuries.
Kelefant was forced to walk an
entire mile of the five mile
course yet still managed to
finish in tenth place. This finish
surely indicates the type of per-
formance Kelefant is capable of
this weekend. Chapman went so
far as to say, ‘‘I consider Kele-
fant in the top five right now.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Marathon Men

Last Tuesday night, the Executive Committee in-
tended to appropriate funds for all undergraduate and
law school organizations. Unfortunately, several of
the decisions did not evolve until the wee hours of
Wednesday morning. In order to hear each organiza-
tion’s budget request, the EC spent over eight hours in
its chambers listening to volumes of pleas and likely

taking handfuls of No-Doze.

What alarms us is the method in which the EC
heard the budget requests. Rather than spreading the
hearings over a two-day period, the EC decided to do
it in a shotgun-fashion. While the rest of the city was
asleep, the EC made decisions affecting many phases

of student life.

Surprisingly, the EC kept the Student Activities
Board’s budget request — all $57,000 of it — until last.
When the SAB’s turn came, the clock read 2 a.m. and
neither the EC nor the SAB’s representatvies ap-
preared in any shape for a serious discussion.

In the future, the EC would do well to schedule these
hearings over a two-day period. We doubt that a one-
day delay in hearing a budget request will cause any
serious damage. A day’s rest would leave both the EC
and requesting parties in better shape for discussion.

What the EC showed was an impressive display of
stamina. Unfortunately, it was also an unnecessary

and unwise.

The Victors

Congratulations are in order for the WAshington
and Lee football team, victors in last Saturday’s
game against Centre College. The Generafs are 2-1
now and many experts agree that W&L will win the
Old Dominion Athletic Qonference this year.

Saturday’s game was dramatic in that the Generals
overcame a 14-0 deficit ito win. Exciting football is
something new to W&L fans. Hopefully the fans will
show their gratitude by coming out in large numbers

at Wilson Field.

housing. ‘We are residential in
the full sense... whereas at W&L

you live all over the city.”
“With the close community
and the option of living alone in
the senior year, I think the

students find it a healthy at-

mosphere.

that the single-sex institutions

THE Rn YouR oF
THiS REARING, WE
TURN TQ ITEM
ON TRE BUDGE T,.. :

Cooperation

Is: Urged

Dear Sir:

The incident of the tire theft
that you referred to in your
“Security” editorial took place
on Oct. 15, 1980, almost one year
ago and as a result, additional
watchmen were hired.

You are correct in your state-
ment that a zero crime rate is
unlikely. However, with the
cooperation of the students, I
think the crime rate will be
drastically reduced this year. If
something is stolen from a stu-
dent’s car he should notify Mr. °
Murray (ext. 153) or myself
(ext. 211) as soon as possible. If
we are not in, leave a number
with the secretary where you
can be reached so we can get in-
formation. The sooner we can
get to work on something, the
likelier we are to get results.

If students own cassette
players, boosters or CB’s, they
should purchase anti-theft lock-
ing devices which are available
for about $2 at local automotive
stores. They are easy to install
and are a good investment to
protect one’s property. All
automobiles should be locked if
they’re left anywhere on cam-
pus overnight. Locking gas caps
are also a good idea.

Should any student see
anything suspicious at any time
in the parking lots, he should
call 463-9111, ext. 198 and ex-
plain that he needs a watchman
at such-and-such a place. If the
response is not satisfactory, tell
me about it and you’ll get a bet-
ter response in the future, I pro-
mise. After midnight, dial
463-9118.

If we all work together on
this, I’m certain the situation
will improve.

Sincerely,
Burr Datz
Assistant Proctor

EC Sits Through Eight Hours Of Budget Hearings

continued from page 1
past, the SAB will hire three big
acts.

Three percent of the budget
went to organizations never
before funded through the E.C.:
the Outing Club, the Washing-
ton and Lee Review, Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship,
and the Computer Club.

After discussing at length the
durability of sleeping bags, the
E.C. trimmed the Outing Club
request to $1500 from almost
twice that amount.

The university funded this
backpacking-canoeing club last
year, but will not this year, ac-
cording to Bob Farsythe, club
leader.

Law student Eric Anderson
presented a request for student
body funds for a political jour-
nal he hopes to see inaugurated
this year.

Such a review would be non-
partisan and open to scholar-
ship from students, faculty and
alumni. Anderson would like to
publish the twenty page tabloid
in February to assure plenty of
time for editing.

The E.C. was interested in the
Review as a way of unifying the
law campus and the undergrad-
uates. Six hundred dollars was
suggested as the likely E.C.
allocation.

Like the Outing Club, Inter-
Varsity is not a new group. This
is, however, the first year it has
applied for student body funds.
The E.C. set $400 as a ten-

tative allocation.

Law Representative Morgan
Griffith noted that the prece-
dent had been set to likewise
fund other religious groups, be
they Jewish, Buddhist or
atheist.

Lee Feldman of the Computer
Club presented a request for
$3,500. The figure included the
cost of an Infoton computer ter-
minal, an IBM selectric type-
writer, and magnetic tapes, all
one-time expenses.

“They will be involved
around the state representing
W&L, they will help with our
swim tournaments, they’ll be
helping students,’’ argued
resentative John Vlahoplus.
“T’ve seen how terrible a job the
university has done with the
computer center.”

“IT don’t think there’s an anti-
computer prejudice on the com-
mittee,’ said Vice President
Jim Averett. Although the E.C.
finally allocated only $200 for
the club, Averett and others
promised support to Feldman.

“Purchase of the selectric
and the ‘Infotrash”’ is a capital-
upgrading project that the Uni-
versity is really responsible
for,” said Vlahoplus.

Two sports clubs, rugby and
fencing, were allocated about
$600 each. Although the Rugby
Club budget contained confus-
ing expenditures such as
scrumsleds and dozens of
oranges, the E.C. was so pleas-
ed to have a well-documented

budget request from the rug-

gers that it allocated the exact
amount requested.

President Myers called it a
“tight”? budget, and pointed out
that transportation costs were
absorbed by the players them-
selves. Club dues are collected
and spent on the traditional
post-game parties.

Rugby bookeeper Todd Alex-
ander conceded that the books
had been mismanaged last
year.

University Counselor James
Worth spoke for the Fencing
Club as coach. His request was
cut to $600 from $690 because
the E.C. felt it could not spend
student funds on a team ban-
quet.

Representative Bent-
talewarned that the allocation
might have to be cut before the
final approval of the budget
next week.

Worth cited cooperation from
Athletics Chairman William
McHenry and other university
coaches. One reason for the
club not becoming a varsity
sport is the lack of someone to
take over as coach should
Worth move on.

The Film Society was allo-
cated $1125, $300 less than it had
requested.

The E.C. questioned the $200
spent in projectionist fees. The
Film Society representative
replied that to use the Law
school for the showings, it was
necessary to hire Law student
projectionists.

Myers believed that the SAB
had used the Law _ School
theater without hiring their pro-
jectionists, who he suspected
were work-study students
already paid by the government
through the school.

‘Furthermore, I don’t see
why W&L students ought to pay
to use their own facilities,”’ said
Myers.

Contact was allocated $9000,
with an unwritten challenge to
the Inter Fraternity Council to
contribute $8000, in which case
another $1000 may come later
from E.C. coffers.

“T think that Contact has the
greatest potential of all the
committees on the (list),”’
stated Ross.

‘T would rather see the Calyx
cut than the Speakers Program
cut. I would rather see the Phi
cu’ to improve Contact,’’ said
Hale.

Contact is also funded by the
IFC, which started the organ-
ization to contribute to the
university’s cultural life, accor-
ding to Myers. The IFC usually
matches the E.C. allocation,
although Averett warned that
the IFC might not be able to this
year.

A theme of Law School under-
graduate reconciliation coursed

the discussion of funding for the
Student Bar Association, the
Ring-tum Phi, the Ariel, and the
Calyx.

The Student Bar was allo-

cated all of the $15,825 that it re-
quested. This figure represents
17 percent of the evening’s
allocations.

Hale suggested that for
economic purposes the Law
News and the Ring-tum Phi be
merged. Law student Tom
Garen replied that there would
not be significant participation
from the Law students to make
the merger useful.

Andrew Trotter of the Ariel
was allocated $2150. Committee
members discussed advertising
in this literary magazine, as
well as scholarship from the
surrounding universities, but no
recommendations were made.

Scott Fitzgerald gave an in-
tricate presentation of the state
of the Calyx. Editor Jack Huskin
explained that the contract with
the publisher had been drawn
and it was too late to combine
his with the Law School year-
book. They received $11,000.

Trent Dickerson of the Ring-
tum Phi presented a budget re-
quest lower than last year’s.The
request was accepted as it stood
at $10,180. Editor Bill Whalen
spoke against a merger of the
Phi and the Law News.

Ariel, Calyx and = Phi
allocations acount for one
quarter of the tentative budget.

The International Club was
granted $150. The Mock Conven-
tion asked for and received
nothing, except the use of the
E.C. account at the Printing Of-
fice.

Would you care to respond to criticism in last

| week's paper for conducting budget hearings into the
| wee hours of one night?

Well, I think that from the stand-point that peo-

| ple on the committee as well the subcommittee
| representatives would be more rested, possibly

more awake from that standpoint it’s possible that
it may have been better to have it on two nights.
But from the stand-point of the Executive Com-
mittee, in the past we've done it in one night to
preserve a lot of the continuity of thought which
goes into the budget hearings. Working with a cer-
tain pool of money and having all requests done in
one night preserves the flow by which committee
members take in the information and disseminate
it. Ithink that outweighs the possibility that people
will get tired and blow it off. I think that all the
committee members, even though it might be late,
try to maintain their composure and take that into
account — that they are getting tired and that
these requests are being made and the later ones
should be considered just as important as the in-
| itialo ones.

THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY
WASHINGTON & LEE UNIVERSITY ra ig
if’ EXIN TON, VA. 24450 OCT v i981

Regarding budget considerations, do you have a
general idea of how funds should be allocated before
the hearings or do you base your decision on in-
dividual needs as presented by the various subcom-
mittees?

Well, we base our decisions on a number of fac-
tors; one would be a committee’s past perfor-
mance and past allocation. We feel that if a com-
mittee has done a certain job up to this point and
established a record of success they should be
allotted at least the same amount, if it’s possible to
do that, as in the past. Another factor is that we try
to encourage as many new clubs as we can by
allotting them funds to start up. We try to weigh
the interest of the established clubs against the re-
quest of new and upcoming clubs, such as the
outing club and the computing machinery club.
Clubs like that look to the E.C. for really their first
breath of life.

Do you think last year’s White Book revisions will
enable you to conduct honor trials more effectively
than previous committees?

Pruning only a $400 allocation
for a Christian group, the Ex-
ecutive Committee ratified its
final budget for the school year
at a Tuesday night meeting.

The budget distributes $98,950
in student body funds to thirteen
student organizations, and to
E.C. accounts.

Debate on the preliminary
allocation to the Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship lasted
almost 90 minutes. President
Frank Williams of IVCF attend-
ed with eight of the group’s
leaders. Jon Pakula and Bill Ar-
cher brought Dr. David R.
Novack of the sociology depart-

ment and four ot.iers to protest
the funding of the Christian
group.

Pakula presented a petition of
110 signatures challenging the
use of student body funds by
any religious group.

‘We just don’t believe,”
stated Pakula, ‘‘in the student
funding of a group whose
religious orientation may be
counter to that of some
members of the student body.”’

Williams argued that no mat-
ter what goals an organization
had, someone would object to it.
Gary Carneal claimed that
IVCF had a right to student
funds because it represented a

IFC Seeks Compromise

by Steve Perry

The Interfraternity Council
unanimously supported a pro-
posal Tuesday night that may
put an end to the ongoing pro-
blems between fraternities and

the Lexington community.

Police Cas Myeteriously Crashes

by Tom Baker

A Lexington patrol officer’s
car was mysteriously moved
and wrecked while he was in-
vestigating the Sigma Nu house
for a noise violation last Satur-
day night.

Patrolman Torben Pedersen
had entered the Sigma Nu house
around 1 a.m. to close down a
band for playing too loud.

“I had put the car in park,
removed the key from the igni-
tion, put the key in my pocket
and left it unlocked; which is
normal procedure,”’ said Peder-

n. “I went inside the frater-
nity to shut down the band and
returned five minutes later,’’ he
continued ‘‘and found the car

smashed against the war

memorial (at the Washington

and Lee University gates ).”’
According to Pedersen, the

 

car can -_ be shifted out of
park when the key is in the igni-
tion switch. Pedersen said the
car’s gear lever was still in the
“‘park’’ position when he found

it. Pedersen said the ‘car had
rolled down Henry St. and was
blocking traffic on Jefferson
Ave.

Pedersen did not think that
students at the party were in-
volved but theorized that the
cruiser may have rolled out of
gear by itself. The cruiser is
made by Ford, which has had
trouble with this model’s
transmissions. Damage to the
automobile was estimated at

$1000.
In other police matters,
Sigma Chi, Pi Kappa Alpha,

Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Phi
Kappa Sigma, each were cited
for violations of the city’s noise
ordinance.

The proposal, which will be
presented to the Lexington City
Council, was drafted by an IFC
subcommittee composed of
several fraternity presidents.
The subcommittee was chaired
by John McIntyre.

The two-part proposal re-
quests the Lexington Police
Department to give W&L fra-
ternities a warning before clos-
ing down a party for noise viola-
tions. The IFC also requested
that amplified music be permit-
ted up tola.m.

In return for these conces-
sions, fraternities would make a
greater effort to clean up the
outsides of houses following
parties. The IFC also voted to
hire a person to clean up litter
left on public property when
party-goers migrate from one
house to another. The last
measure would not be im-

plemented until next year,
however.
In other business, McIntvre

complained about the continu-
ing presence of uninvited VMI

NUMBER 4

EC Denies IVCF Request

significant constituency of
Washington and Lee students
who must pay the $55 activities
fee that goes to the E.C. budget.

Morgan Griffith, senior law
representative, said he regret-
ted his vote last week in favor of
the IVCF allocation, and stated
that he thought religion was too
personal a matter for the E.C.
to be involved in.

Archer said that although this
was not a state government,
“the constitution is our
heritage,’ and therefore first
amendment privileges should
be respected and “religious
groups should not dip into
public funds.”’

Secretary Bennett Ross com-
mented, ‘‘I think this (IVCF) is
the social life for a lot of peo-
ple... This is something the
committee has been grossly
negligent in — providing alter-
native ‘life styles’ for people
outside the mainstream.”’

‘You could fund the Indepen-
dent Union,”’ answered Pakula,

citing a group that did not peti-
