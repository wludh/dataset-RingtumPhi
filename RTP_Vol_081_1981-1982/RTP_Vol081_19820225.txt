by G. Bruce Potter

Last season, the Washington#
and Lee basketball team went®
on a season-ending three-game ™
Old Dominion Athletic Con-g
ference road-trip with a 16-6
record and returned with a 16-9
mark.

This year, the squad left for
the identical trip at 17-5, won
two of the three contests and
closed their regular season with
a 19-6 record, tied for first place
with Roanoke in the ODAC and
ranked 18th in the latest NCAA
Division III basketball poll.

“‘That’s one heck of a job for a
transition team,”’ smiled head
fa coach Verne Canfield.

But now the second season
s—the tournaments — begins.

W&L, seeded second by the
ODAC’s tie-breaking system,
will host Eastern Mennonite

College at 7:30 tonight in the

Warner Center in the ODAC

quarterfinals. The Generals |

dispatched Mennonite 84-74 and —
| 71-51 during the regular season, ©
_ but the Royals, who finished |
11-13, 4-10 in the ODAC, boast ©
the conference’s top scorer in
‘Stephfan Allen (22.4) and the
top rebounder in Larry Sheets -
(13.96).
, “We must continue our good
team defense,” said Canfield.
“‘We must execute basic things
like boxing out. A key will be
how many second and third
shots we prevent them from
getting. We need to set the tem-
po. We played well against
them before, but we are playing @
better now. We’re closer to our
potential.

“It is a great advantage play- #
ing at home,” he continued.
‘“‘We’ve worked very hard for
the home court advantage, but
if no one comes, we may as well
be playing in Timbuktu. ”’

The Generals gained momen-
tum for the tourney by downing
Shenandoah in a_ non-con-
ference game 78-61, Mennonite
71-51, and Maryville 66-61 in
fovertime. The loss came to
Roanoke 83-67. Ee

— “To win in overtime on the
road is something in itself,”
said Canfield of the Maryville
victory which ended the regular
season. It was the Generals’ se- , :
cond overtime triumph of the aoa
year, both on the road, with no . wi eo:
overtime losses.

Down 27-25 at the half, W&L §
»,came back to tie the score at 53
to set up the overtime period.
Actually, Maryville had a
chance to win but missed a free
throw with 12 seconds left, and
the Generals were unable to get
off a shot before the buzzer.
Junior Frank Eppes and sopho-
more Billy Yates scored 22
points each for Washington and
Lee, and John Lee Graves, who,
along with Brian Hanson, pulled
down seven rebounds, added 11.
W&L shot 54.2 percent from the
field to the Scots 46 percent.
“Our defense took them out of
their offensive patterns,’ ex-
| plained Canfield. ;

Only shooting 39.3 percent
from the floor in the first half,
tee the Generals only led Eastern
Mennonite 25-24 at the intermis-
sion. The Royals had built a#

  
 
 
   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 
  
 
  
   
  

  
 
 
 
 
 
 

‘and Hanson’s bucket with three
seconds remaining gave W&L
the lead they would never relin
-__, quish.

In fact, from that point on, it”
wasn’t even close. Canfield
“discussed” a few things with —
he team at the half, and they ©
came out and simply destroyed. —
Mennonite. Ten straight points,
eight of them by Graves, sealed
he outcome with the Generals
up 58-40 at the 3:52 mark. |
‘In the first half, it was justa J
case of the shots not dropping §
in,” said Canfield. ‘‘When that
happens, you must concentrate
on some other phase of the
game and the shooting will take
care of itself.’’ It certainly did,
jas W&L shot a blistering 61.5 ©
jpercent in the second period.

REVIEW and O

 

 

| Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Housing Woes

Once again we have returned from a vacation. Once
| again, we have crime stories to report. It seems that
| W&L going on vacation means a field day on break-
ins around Lexington.

| At a glance, the obvious solution would be to tighten
_ security while the student body is on vacation. We

believe that this may not be the only solution,
| however.

| This year, the administration decided to cram as
many freshman as feasible into the three dormitories

"across the street from Graham-Lees. The result has

| been a shortage of housing for upperclassmen and
law students.

What is alarming is that upperclassmen not living
_ in fraternities do not have much of a selection for

housing. Houses in the country are easy targets for .

thieves. The same goes for some housing in the city.
Even the fraternities are risky, since criminals know
they can find a large assortment of goods in each
house. What’s a person to do?

Once way to improve the situation would be a com-
mittee, consisting of students and adminstrators, that
_ could examine this problem. Many faculty members

remember what it was like to live in Lexington during

their college days. With the imput of students who are
currently facing this dilemma, the committee might
be able to reach some alternatives.

Living in a small town should at least include safe
housing. We believe the university should take steps
to provide its students with an honest selection of
_ more secure housing.

A display of documents and
photographs tracing the history
of the Ann Smith Academy from
its earliest stages to the present
is currently on exhibit in the
Boatwright Room of the Univer-
sity Library at Washington and
Lee.

The display opened Monday,
February 15 and will continue
through the end of April. The
Boatwright Room, located on
lower level one of the Universi-
ty Library, is open from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Monday through Fri-
day

Organized in 1807, the Ann
Smith Academy was the second
oldest incorporated girls’ school
in Virginia. The original school

building was situated on the

corner of Lee and Nelson
Streets in Lexington where the
Chi Psi fraternity house is
located now. The academy re-
mained in operation almost
without interruption for 96
years.

Narrative for the library
display was prepared by Dr.
William W. Pusey III, emeritus
‘dean and professor of German
at Washington and Lee. Pusey,

Dear Sir: |

I want to express my intense
displeasure with the E.C.’s ir-
responsible use of student
funds. When your illustrious
publication announced that the
E.C. was spending over $55,000
on a dance, I assumed that the
Phi had made an un-
characteristic typographical
error. When I learned to my
horror that the E.C. was indeed
spending over one-twentieth of
a million dollars solely on
alcoholic entertainment, the
sheer folly of it all started me
thinking of alternative uses for
our money. Although I realize
that some money comes from
admission fees, here are a few
of my suggestions on what the
E.C. can do with student funds
instead of wasting them on
frivolous things such as Fancy
Dress: ;

(1) Buy “Sweet Things’ and

give students free ice cream

when it snows.

(2) Give every member of the
E.C. a Renault “Le Car’ for
Christmas.

(3) Give the money to Presi-
dent Reagan to help him
balance the U.S. budget.

(4) Put the money in Cer-
tificates of Deposit and pay
every member of the Class of
1982 three dollars a year for life.

(5) Give President and Mrs.
Huntley a Mercedes as a going
away gift.

(6) Increase the budget of the
Ring-tum Phi so it doesn’t have
to accept condom adver-
tisements.

(7) Establish a faculty chair
to study the psychotic effects on
teenagers of all-male institu-
tions.

(8) Buy five new police cars
for the Lexington Police Dept.
so some zany, fun-loving frater-

who has written several studies
dealing with the history of
WAL, is the author of a paper on
‘‘Lexington’s Female
Academy”? to appear in
Virginia Calvalcade and is cur-
rently conducting further
research on the Ann Smith
Academy.

Documents in the display in-
clude the original minute book
for the Academy, a copy of the
act of incorporation in 1808, a
conduct book in which ‘“‘dis-
grace marks’ were recorded
opposite the names of the
students, and a journal that
records a list of subscriptions to

The Washington and Lee
University Glee Club will be
joined by the Lexington High
School Choir in a concert in Lee
Chapel at 8 p.m. tonight:

The concert is free and open
to the public.

The concert marks the first
time that the two outstanding
groups have appeared together.

Included on the program will
be a combined performance of
Randall Thompson’s “Frostian-

 

nity members can run them into
the War Memorial.

(9) Buy a U.S. Congressman.

(10) Buy Davidson Park Apts.
and invite 5000 Haitian and
Cuban refugees to move to Lex-
ington.

(11) Construct a huge’ sound-
proof plastic bubble and rent it
to fraternities to put over their
houses so parties could continue
until, dare I say, 2:00 a.m.

(12) Send the entire E.C. on
an all expense paid trip to El
Salvador for a month.

entry for one “Thom. Jeffer-
son.”

academy posed around.

photograph of ceremonies held

tiquities placed a plaque on the
current building commem-

na” series, seven pieces based
on the poetry of Robert Frost.

In addition, the W&L Glee
Club will perform Kodali’s
“The Peacocks” and ‘“‘The Last
Words of David,’’ also by Ran-
dall Thompson.

The W&L Glee Club is
directed by Dr. Gordon Spice
while Charles Torian conducts
the Lexington High School
Choir. Theresa Zybko will be |

. the accompanist.

Spending Suggestions Made

(13) Buy 1200 M-16 rifles and a
surplus M-60 tank and attack
V.M.LI.

(14) Give a senior physics stu-
dent a grant to build an atomic
bomb and then blackmail the
Lexington town council into
abolishing the noise ordinance.

(15) Have a wienie roast and
invite everyone in Virginia.

Now of course these are only
suggestions. The E.C. is free to
do what they want with our
money and I suppose a showing
of Washington and Lee
students’ complete lack of
academic concern is just as
good as supporting a library or
scholarship fund, or donating
money to the United Way. If
Washington and Lee cannot be
the best at academics, it might
as well be the best at something
else.

Respectfully yours,
Drew Demaray ’83L

 

 

 

Students’ Work Praised

Dear Phi,

In my opinion, not enough is
said about the positive interac-
tion which occurs cross cam-
pus. As examples I need only
point to the work of two
undergraduate EC committees.

Mike Drinkwater and the rest
of the Contact committee
members have just recently
provided us with the opportuni-
ty to hear two excellent legal
thinkers at Lee Chapel: F. Lee
Bailey and Arthur Miller.

The work of the Student Ac-
tivities Board has been par-
ticularly outstanding this year.
I doubt you will find people to
replace the likes of John Martin

and Bobby Schmidt for some
time to come. They have helped
us organize our own social ac-

‘tivities on a number of occa-

sions as well as doing an ex-
cellent job on their main
responsibilities across the
ravine.

The Tuesday night concert
series in the Cockpit has been
particularly entertaining
—often providing better enter-
tainment than can be found on
the weekends in Lexington, We
appreciate it.

Sincerely,
Tom Gearen
President,
Student Bar Association

Student Bar Announces It Will Raise Dues

by Ben Jarratt

The Student Bar Association
will raise its dues from $10 to
$20 next year to supplement a
strained budget. The subcom-
-Mittee presented its monthly
budget report Monday night to
the Executive Committee.

The E.C. also heard reports
from the Calyx, the Washington
and Lee Political Review and
the Ariel.

Tom Gearen, president of the
SBA, said “‘the main reason for
the dues increase is because
we’ve been cannibalizing other

Freshman’s Room Hit

Two Times Over Holiday

by Tom Baker

One Washington and Lee stu-
dent’s room was broken into
twice over the recent
Washington Holiday.

Brian McCausland, a fresh-
man living in Lee House II on
Lee Avenue reported that some-
one entered his room while he
was on vacation and stole cash
and goods totalling over $170.

The intruder apparently
picked a lock to enter through
one of the room’s doors and then
proceeded to rip the hinges and
chains off a closet door. Inside
the closet, McCausland had left
over $70 in tapes and approx-
imately $100 in cash. The break-
in apparently occured on Mon-
day, Feb. 15.

Although McCausland and his
roomate were away during the
break, Kevin McClatchy,
another freshman, was staying
in the room. McClatchy was not
present at the time of the break-
in, but reported the crime to
Lexington police.

The second break-in occured
on Saturday, Feb. 20, sometime
between 7 and 8 p.m. At that
time, someone apparently
broke down the front door
leading onto McCausland’s
room and stole his stereo
receiver. A witness claimed to
see a man wearing an orange
backpack leaving the area at
that time. Again, McClatchy
was out at that time.

Police .said they are in-
vestigating both break-ins.

Mollenhoff Gives Speech

Clark R. Mollenhoff, pro-
fessor of journalism at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, addressed the subject of ex-
ecutive privilege in a speech to
the Sigma Delta Chi/Society of
Professional Journalists at the
University of Central Florida in
Orlando recently.

Mollenhoff, who testified on
the subject of executive
privilege before a congressional

subcommittee last year, drew
comparisons between
‘government-press relations in
the United States and in Britain.

On Wednesday, March 3,
Mollenhoff will be the featured

committees to help maintain an
active social committee. Four
committees funded last year
are no longer being funded.

‘Most of the raise will go to
social,” stated Gearen, ‘“‘but
some will replenish the funds
cut from other committees.
When tuition is increased $600 a
year, most people won’t object
toa $10 raise.”

Gearen said the SBA is sup-
porting professor Samuel
Calhoun to get tenure. The SBA
is also funding a ‘Sloppy
Dress”’ party as an alternative
for law students who prefer not
to attend Fancy Dress.

Calyx

Scott Fitzgerald, business
manager of the Calyx, said the
records were
destroyed in a fire two weeks

.ago. Fitzgerald said the W&L

Business Office was willing to
go back through their records to
compile the lost records. E.C.
Vice-president Jim Averett said
he had a computer printout of

‘their

subcommittee expenditures
that could be of some assist-
ance.

Jack Huskin, editor of the
Calyx, said the final deadline is
March 5 — Fancy Dress. It will
cost about $30 a page extra to in-
clude the weekend in the year-
book. He said any fraternity
member who has pictures of
fraternity activities
should feel free to submit them
to the Calyx.

Political Review

Eric Anderson reported the
Washington and Lee Political
Review should be out by the
first week in April. 15 authors,
including two professors, sub-
mitted articles. The Review will
go to the printers next week and
final expenses will be known at
that time.

Ariel

Andrew Trotter said the
Spring edition of the Ariel has a
March 15 deadline. He also
reported that the Publications
Board has purchased a used

enlarger for the darkroom. The

_ two-year-old model cost $400.

Leonard Howard said the
Library Advisory Committee is
acquiring audio-visual equip-
ment for the University
Library.

Averett said the Virginia Stu-
dent Association spoke to him
about a bill requiring smoke
detecters in dormitories. The
E.C. decided to let the ad-
ministration handle this mat-
ter.

Averett added the Big Three
elections will be held Monday,
March 8. Petitions are due at
6:30 p.m. in the E.C. room on
March 1.

in the season, they out-re-
bounded the Maroons 42-25. At
Roanoke, however, the tables
were turned as_ the hosts
dominated the boards 40-29 en
route to the 83-67 victory.
‘Roanoke was highly motiva-
ted,’ said Canfield, who added
that the rebounding statistic
basically tells the story.

A Hanson basket gave the
Generals a 20-10 lead midway
through the first half, but the
Maroons came back to take the
lead for good at 27-26 and had
upped that to 41-35 by the half.
About the only bright spot for
W&L was the fact that they only
committed eight turnovers.
Yates lead the squad with 16
points, and Eppes added 15 and
Hanson 14.

Eppes scored a career-high 24
points on a 10-11 performance
from the floor and a 4-4 mark
from the foul line to lead the

team to the 78-61 victory over
Shenandoah. The Generals
trailed at 6-2 but tallied ten con-
secutive points and never look-
ed back.

The 6-10 center averaged
18.25 points for the four games
to raise his season average to
9.2. Canfield also cited the re-
cent play of Yates, saying,
‘‘He’s playing basketball the
way I knew he could all along.”

In comparing this year’s
season-ending triumphs to last
year’s virtual collapse, Canfield
said, ‘‘The guys have put ina lot
of hard work, and they’ve
responded to the demands I’ve
put on them as-a team. I’ve
worked them a little harder,
and they’ve responded.

“It has been a very satisfying
year to this point.”’

He also praised the contribu-
tions of some of his younger
players: ‘‘We have five

For the first time this year,
there will be a small admission
fee of $1.00 for students and

the number of matches over
last year from 12 to 14. Navy
and Syracuse, two teams that
finished in the U.S.I.L.A. top
ten, will be new competition
from last season as well as the
addition of Duke and Lafayette.

Six of the Generals’ 14 games
this season are with top ten
finishers. In addition to Navy
and Syracuse there will be N.C.
State, Virginia, U.M.B.C., and
national champs North Caro-
lina. |

Head coach Emmer calls this
challenging calendar ‘‘a good

“*We’ve always Said that we'll
play whoever is interested in
playing us,” said Emmer,
“we've always felt that the bet-
ter the team we play the better
we'll become.”

The Attack

Washington and Lee returns
only 11 lettermen on its 32 man
roster and the heart of this
return is on attack. Much of the
attack will be in the sticks of
seniors Rob Staugaitis and
Mike Schuler, two of the tri-
captains, as well as senior Geoff

more Lee Heimert.

“We don’t have as much
depth as we have had,”’ said
coach Emmer, ‘‘we’ll play a
more controlled game instead
of a run and gun type offense.”’

To help maintain this control
attack Emmer will sub in his
best offensive midfielders. The
middies to watch will be senior
John Sancilio and juniors John
Tunney, John Doub, and Bob
Carpenter.

The Defense

Two letter men return on
defense in a year of which coach
Emmer says, ‘“‘we’ll be trying
to develop on defense.’’ Mike
Pressler, who missed almost
half of the season last year due
to injury, senior Dave Nickels,
and Steve Conboy are the only
defensemen that return off of
last’ year’s squad. Coming up
from the junior varsity to add
depth will be Roland Simon,
Newton Kendrick, and Bill
Sharp. Nickels and Conboy are
the biggest men on the team,
both at 6-3, 200 Ibs.

Florida. Phil Aiken is new to the
W&L varsity after playing with
the J.V. last year.

“We're ready to play the
others any time,’’ said Emmer.

The Outlook

The Generals have a big
challenge in the 1982 schedule
and will have to play at a con-
sistently high level, having to go
against the best competition in
the nation each week of the
season.

‘The key to the season,’’ said
Emmer, “‘is taking advantage
of our personnel. We've got a lot
of young kids that will be
coming along.

‘“‘We believe we can be suc- -
cessful by taking one game at a
time. We've got enough ex-
perience to control the ball and
make people do what we want
them to.”’

Swimmers Win 2 Of 3, Move Over .500

by Andrew P. Hoppes

W&L’s swimming team has’
fulfilled one of its major goals
for the season by finishing
above .500 with a 6-5 record.

The Generals secured the
winning Season by winning two
of the three contests over the
Washington’s birthday break.
The Generals topped Virginia
Commonwealth College, 62-49,
and Georgetown, 65-35, before
dropping a 65-48 decision to
Glassboro State.

One of the highlights in the
VCU meet was provided by
freshman Bobby Pearson.
Pearson swam a strong anchor-
lap in the 400-yard freestyle
relay to key a W&L win in the
event.

Highlighting the meet with

 

Small College
Award Goes
To Cavalline

Chris Cavalline, a Wash-
ington and Lee University foot-
ball standout from St. Mary’s,
Pa., received the Richmond
Touchdown Club’s ‘1981 Small
College Offensive Player-of-the-
Year’ award on Wednesday,
January 20 at the Club’s 19th an-
nual awards dinner. The junior
tailback is believed to be the
first W&L player recognized by
the Club.

‘‘When he accepted the honor,
he mentioned that it belonged
as much to his teammates as it
did to him. That’s the type of
student-athlete he is —
unselfish — as indicated by the
fact he’s been elected one of our
team tri-captains for 1982.”’

Cavalline finished the 1981
campaign with 765 yards and
seven touchdowns on 235
rushing attempts, 221 yards on
23 pass receptions, and a 35.0-
yard average on 36 punts. He
also completed three of five
passes for 58 yards as. the
Generals posted an 8-2 record
(their best since 1962) and won
the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference title. In November,
Cavalline received the ODAC’s
Player-of-the-Year honor.

‘‘Thanks to help from Chris,
we enjoyed a prosperous cam-
paign,”’ remarked Fallon, who
completed his fourth year at the
W&L helm.

Mike Bernot and Rand McClain
and two Glassboro State swim-
mers whose best times in the 50-
yard freestyle ranked them se-
cond arid third nationally.

Bernot and McClain faired
‘well against the nationally
ranked swimmers, with Bernot
first in the 50 and 100, and Mc-
Clain third and second, respec-
tively.

The Generals also competed

in the UNC-Wilmington Invita-

tional over vacation, earning a
seventh place finish. W&L was
only 30 points a of fourth

 

SAE,NFFHF
Honor McKee

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity football standout John B.
McKee, from Clarksdale, Miss.,
recently received prestigious
honors from the National Foot-
ball Foundation & Hall of Fame
(NFFHF) and from the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon National Frater-
nity.

McKee received the NF-
FHF’s NCAA Division III
Scholar-Athlete award, one of
two small college honors
bestowed by the Foundation,
which provides a_ $1000
fellowship for post-graduate
studies. Sigma Alpha Epsilon
placed McKee on its 25-member
Small College All-America
team to mark the second con-
secutive year he has received

the honor. 1981 marked the 43rd .

year for the team, which is
chosen by SAE football alumni
from across the country.

“There aren’t enough adjec-
tives to describe this young
man,” offers Washington and
Lee head coach Gary Fallon.

In addition to his football
status, he is an accomplished
shot put performer for the W&L
track squad, placing first in the
event at the 1981 Old Dominion
Athletic Conference Indoor
Championships and second at
the 1981 ODAC Outdoor Cham-
pionships.

place, however, a very small
margin in a meet of this type.
With most of their major com-
petition now behind them, nine
Generals have qualified for the

NCAA Division II] Champion-

ships which will be held at W&L
March 18-20. Bernot, Tim Rock,
Rob Crawford, and McClain
have qualified in individual
events, while the members of
the 400-yard medley, 400-yara
freestyle, and 800-yard free-
style relay teams have also
qualified.

Wrestlers Take Four
Straight, Finish At 8-6

by John Harrison

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team completed a
successful season by taking all
four of its final matches. The 8-6
finish marks a significant im-
provement considering that the
past two teams _ produced
records of 4-9 and 3-8.

The winning streak that even-
tually put the Generals over .500
began February 11 at the
University of Richmond. Wes
Payne (18-4), Greg Kendrick
(fall), and Jeff Dixon (fall) con-
tributed to a 31-20 defeat of the
Spiders.

Two days later in.the Warner
Center, the Generals defeated
Lynchburg 30-21 and Hampden-
Sydney 24-20. Payne (8-6), Dix-
on (14-4), Joe O’Neill (6-0), cap-
tain Tim Valliere (11-0) and
Carlton Peebles were winners
against the Tigers, while five
forfeits by Lynchburg in the up-
per weights were solely respon-

sible for giving W&L tue deci-
sion over the Hornets.

The season concluded on Feb.
16 as Longwood fell to the
Generals 28-18. Ron Thornton

(15-9), Dixon (5-3), Peebles
(5-1) and O’Neill (fall) led the
way for W&L.

Head coach Gary Franke was
pleased with this year’s turn-
around but at the same time
emphasizes that there still is
room for improvement. ‘After
two losers,” said the coach, ‘‘we
made a respectable showing.
We’ll just have to set our sights
higher for next year.”’

Franke also expressed disap-
pointment that none of the six
representatives from W&L in
the NCAA Division Regionals
qualified for the Nationals. Tim
Valliere and Jeff Dixon were
runners-up in the 158 and 177
pound divisions, respectively,
and Greg Kendrick finished
third at 167.

QDAC Championships
This Weekend

Freshmen will play a key role
this Saturday, Febuary 27,when
the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity track team indoor track
team competes in the sixth an-
nual Old Dominion Athletic
Conference meet Championship
meet at Lynchburg College. The
Generals, who placed third at
last winter’s championships,
will joinBridgewater, Roanoke,
Emory and Henry, and Lynch-
burg College at the 14-event
meet.

‘Due to last spring’s gradua-
tion and to injuries this winter,
we'll count_on freshmen to fill
some big shoes in the running
events in this meet,’’ states
12th-year Head Coach Norris
Aldridge, who points to Chris
Ives, Chris Busbee, Scott
Henderson, Martin Pruitt,

Frank Pittman, and Mark Pem-
broke as the key candidates.

W&L’s upper class com-
petitors include junior captain
Alan Armitage, senior captain
Russ Rector, and senior John
McKee. Armitage placed se-
cond in the 60-yard high hurdles
at the 1981 ODAC meet-and is a
favorite for first place this
year” according to Aldridge.
Rector placed second in the tri-
ple jump and fifth in the high
jump last winter. McKee won
the shot put competition last
year ‘‘ but will be pushed this
year by Lynchburg’s entry”’ ac-
cording to the coach. Another
W&L defending champion
junior Gene Fellin inthe pole
vault, is questionable due to a
leg injury.

A Quick Dip ‘On Golden Pond’

Review:

by Todd Jones

On Golden Pond is a story
about an old married couple on
vacation in New England. The
husband is a bitter old man
obsessed with death. His
daughter, whom he never was
particularly fond of, comes for
a visit and leaves her fiancee’s
son with the couple for a month.

The movie chooses to focus on
the relationship that evolves
between the old man and the
boy and how the boy, working
with the old man’s wife,
changes the old man’s attitudes
on life and death.

The old man is played, of
course, by Henry Fonda.
Almost the entire film circles
around him and he is excellent.
Jane Fonda, as the daughter,
also gives an excellent perfor-
mance. Ms. Fonda is bitter
about her childhood and is con-
vinced that her father hates
her. Her part in the film is quite
small and most of the time she
can be found in a bathing suit.
Both Jane and Henry have been

nominated for Academy
Awards, making possible the

first-ever father/daughter com-

bination(in 1948, John and
Walter Huston were the first
and only father/son team to win
Oscars).

The matriarch of the family is
portrayed by none other than
Katherine Hepburn. Her
character is a cheerful woman
whose only goal in life seems to
cheer and support her husband.
Hepburn too was nominated for
an Oscar. Her performance is
good, but not perhaps up to the
usual Hepburn standard.

Supporting this cast of
cinematic heavyweights is
dependable Dabney Coleman,
who plays Jane Fonda’s lover.
His part is very small and most
of the time he seems uncomfor-
table around these luminaries.

The cast as a whole does an
excellent acting job, however.
Mark Rydell, the director,
lessens the film’s effect by mak-
ing it too soggy, too tear-jerky.

Still, there are some excellent

scenes. One in particular has
the elderly Fonda out picking

strawberries when, all of a sud-
den, he realizes he is lost. Fon-

da’s portrayal of a man lost ona
trail he has walked a thousand
times is outstanding.

Unfortunately, Rydell has a
tendency to make every scene a
tragic, poignant statement on
life. Rydell’s handling of more
comical scenes are more adept
than his attempts to lay a lot of
pathos on the audience.

On Golden Pond was
nominated for 10 Academy
Awards including Best Picture,
Best Actor and Actress, Best
Director, Best Screenplay, Best
Editing, Best Cinematography
and Original Score. Oh yes,
Jane is up for Best Supporting
Actress.

With the hype this film has
received and the sentimental
pull for veterans Fonda and
Hepburn, the movie is likely to.
walk away with a few of these
awards.

An exhibition of 19th-century
wood engravings by artist
Winslow Homer will open in
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s duPont Gallery on Friday,
February 26.

Homer had been an appren-
tice to a Boston lithographer,
using his drawing talents for
tedious and routine copy work.
Within two years, he quit and
embarked on a career as a free-
lance illustrator.

His first published work ap-
peared in ‘‘Ballou’s Pictorial
Drawing-Room Companion” in
1857. At about the same time, a
new illustrated magazine,
‘‘Harper’s,’’ was starting up
and successfully attracted the
best writers and illustrators.
Homer submitted works to
‘‘Harper’s’” beginning a long

Shown In duPont

association during which the
magazine printed almost
everything Homer submitted,
occasionally on the cover. |
‘Although his main interest
began to shift towards painting,
for which he is perhaps best

_ known today, Homer continued

his magazine career,’’ explains
Estelle Porter, the Virginia
Museum’s state services coord-
inator. ‘““His work as a print-
maker had taught him the
disciplined use of black and
white elements in his composi-
tions. It also forced him to
simplify details, to ooncentrate
on essentials, and to develop his
surface with clearly-defined
forms bathed in natural light.”
According to Porter, Homer’s
work, as seen in the duPont ex-
hibition, ‘‘transcends mere
commercial illustration.”

 

 

 

Nillinger At Happy How

If your diet of live entertain-
ment consists largely of urbane
cabaret singers who trade dark
secrets in dark rooms, then
country singer-song-writer-
guitarist Willie Nininger will-
appear as a cool, lighthearted
relief.

Over the past four years he
has appeared on his own, with
various members of his family
and as opening act for the
heavyweight likes of Livingston
Taylor, Lori Lieberman, Aztec
Two-Step, Pete Seeger and Jim-
my Buffet at colleges and in cof-

fee houses and concert halls
along the East Coast.

Like many Sixties teenagers
with musical predilections, Nin-
inger, in eighth grade, began
playing in local bands in Briar-
cliff, New York. He graduated
from Tufts University (where
he also taught a Song and
Songwriters course at the Ex-
perimental College) in 1974 with
a BA in English.

Check out Willie Ninger in the
Cockpit this Friday, February
26th during Happy Hour.

The Deal Here Saturday

Charlottesville has tradi-
tionally been the home of great
music. From New Wave to
Southern Rock, a multitude of
bands provide entertainment
for a teeming college town.
Even with this great number of
bands, Charlottesville’s atten-
tion has been seized this year by
The Deal.

The Deal is a vocally-oriented
pop-rock band. By performing
their own music they have
become immensely popular and
have broken all-time atten-
dance records at several clubs.

There are five members of
The Deal. Eric Schwartz and
Mark Roebuck play rhythm
guitar and Haines Fullerton
plays lead. The band’s bass
player is Jim Jones while. per-
cussion is supplied by Hugh
Patton. Jim, Mark, Eric and

Haines all sing, combining to
give’ the band a_ unique,
harmony-oriented vocal sound.

The Deal is expanding their
listening market with predic-
table success. Their perfor-
mances are guaranteed to pro-
vide audiences with energetic,
first-rate entertainment.

Saturday’s concert begins at 9
p.m. and should last to 1 a.m. A
$1 cover will be taken at the
door.

‘Utopia’
On Stage

“‘Utopia,’’ a one-act comedy
written and directed by
Washington and Lee senior
Peter Moody, will be presented
tonight through Saturday at the

Skip Castro Concert Site Moved

Skip Castro is scheduled to be
the ‘‘mystery’’ guest at the Fan-
cy Dress Ball. Due to some
technical difficulties, Skip will
still play at midnight, but will
appear in Doremus Gym rather
than Warner Center.

When it comes to introduc-
tions, The Skip Castro Band
doesn’t mess around. Their
music is equally straightfor-
ward as the four Charlottesville

musicians deliver a_ no-frills
rhythm and blues performance.

The Skip Castro Band’s cof-
feehouse concerts are delivered
with gut-level punch before.an
enthusiastic crowd.

Although the band was form-
ed less than two years ago, The
Skip Castro Band has earned a
devout regional following,

largely due to a reputation for
knocking out frathouse crowds

Add to that skillfully exeouted
challengers like Little Feat’s
“Fat Man. in the Bathtub,”
Elvis Costello’s ‘Lip Service’
and a couple of interesting
original compositions, and you
have a surprisingly varied for-
mat for an R&B bar band.

“Twelve-Bar songs tend to
get people going faster when
they’re drinking,” says bassist
Charlie Pastorfield. ‘‘No com-
plications.” But when they -
aren't plugging away at
lengthy, uncomplicated ver-
sions of “Kansas City’ or
“Justine,” The Skip Castro
Band introduces some genuine-
ly creative material.
“Camera,”’ for example, writ-
ten by keyboardist Dan Beirne,
demonstrated that bar bands
can perform unique music.
