Superdance Set To Kick Off

by Tom Baker

Besides being an event in-
volving as many as 200 dancers,
the Washington and Lee annual
dance marathon for Muscular
Dystrophy is expected to be a
great party. The thirty-hour
event features bands, pie
throws, and similar festivities
designed for those who want to
come and observe the action.

A year ago, 160 dancers took
part in the event which raised
more than $12,000 for the benefit

of the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.

The four bands include the
Robbin Thompson Band, a
group that will play beach and

- rock music beginning at 8 p.m.

Friday night; Casper, a top-40
band that will play from 11 p.m.
—3a.m., Friday — Saturday.

On Saturday, the Red Ball
Jets, a hard-rock band similar
to Trax, will appear from 6 p.m.
to 10 p.m. The final band will be
The Drifters, a beach band that

will perform from 10 p.m. to 2
a.m,

Superdance ’82, will also hold
pie throws in which the highest
bidder gets to hit the target of
his investment. Some of the pie
targets include History Pro-

fessor John Holt Merchant,

W&L football Head Coach Gary
Fallon, and Politics Professor
John Handelman.

Admission will be $5 per per-
son or $8 per couple for passes
that last the entire weekend.

Miller Grills Students

In Privacy

by Todd Smith

“There is no longer any place,
literally or figuratively, to
hide,”’ said Harvard Law Pro-
fessor Arthur Miller in an ad-
dress on journalism and the
right of privacy in Lee Chapel
on Tuesday.

“Every time we turn around
we are interrogated, reported,
surveyed, questioned,
dossiered....’’ said Miller, who
arrived 30 minutes late eating
an ice cream cone. He noted a
“privacy revolution” was mak-
ing it more difficult for the
media to investigate in-
dividuals’ credit ratings and
criminal records.

Miller has written 25 books
and is a weekly feature on ABC-
TV’s ‘‘Good Morning
America.” His public television
program ‘‘Miller’s Court’
shows him questioning an au-
dience jury on legal issues, a
technique he used on a 13-
person panel of W&L students
and professors.

“I think the beginning of
democracy is when I have
enough control over myself that
I deal out the informational
cards about myself,” said
Miller, ‘“‘and that the govern-

ment and the journalists are not'
to intrude upon my privacy, to
rip off my informational profile,
to ‘rape’ me, in the data sense.”’

Calling journalists ‘‘scream-
ing hemophiliacs stuck with
pins,’ Miller likened the
media’s resistance to privacy
laws to “the classic Chicken-
Little Syndrome.”

In his questioning of the
“jury” Miller said that no real
definition exists for what is
“newsworthy.” He said that the
decision whether to print a

‘potentially damaging story

rests on personal moralities of
writers and editors.
Miller illustrated his Socratic

Lexington’s

There were no violent crimes
and, in fact, there was an
overall decrease by 15 percent
in the number of complaints
handled by the Lexington Police
Department in the 1981 calen-
dar year, according to the An-
nual Police Report released last
Thursday’s Council meeting.

Lexington Police Chief James
A. Kirby said he had no idea
what caused the overall
decrease and said it was pro-
bably nothing more than
evidence of a year-to-year fluc-

tuation.

The report revealed that
there were no murder, man-
slaughter or rape charges
reported to the Department
during 1981. Breaking-and-
entering and theft declined by
as much as 60 percent, and
there were only two reports of
robbery. Of all the criminal
felonies and misdemeanors
reported, the Police Depart-
ment was able to solve approx-
imately 43 percent, which is
well above the national
average.

IFC Appoints Rush Committee

by Scott Mason

It was roughly two weeks ago
that whispers of a ‘Delayed’
Rush system began to emerge
from the voices of Interfraterni-
ty Council members. Since that
time, the Executive Committee
has broached the subject, too
and Rush has become a topic of
immense interest and debate.

Although discussion of a new-
ly proposed Rush system has
thus far experienced only
limited discourse, I.F.C. Presi-
dent Hall Vetterlein com-
mented that a five-man com-
mittee has been appointed ‘‘to
study problems with the current
system and possible problems
with a second semester Rush.”’

en ae

Tuesday’s Blood Drive netted 204 pints of blood for the Red Cross.

The committee, chaired by
senior Jack Wells, includes
head dorm counselor Rob
Staugaitis, sophomore
Christopher Lykes and two ad-
ditional fraternity members to
be named at a later date.

Both pros and cons with the
present system as well as those
of a new system which would
defer Rush for as many as six
weeks into the school year are
issues facing the I.F.C and its
five-man committee. Tae I.F.C.
is aware of the importance of a
freshman’s decision in choosing
a fraternity which is best suited
to his likes, and a delayed Rush
system would provide more

   

W&L student giving blood in Doremus gymnasium.

The total amount of goods
stolen by breaking and entering
and larcenies was slightly more
than $58,000. The Police Depart-
ment reported that it was only
able to recover about $14,000
worth of the stolen goods, which
amounts to a recovery rate of
nearly 25 percent.

Parking in a restricted zone
and improper parking were the
two most frequent law viola-
tions handled by the Depart-
ment. Together, these two
violations brought in revenues
from the fines of more than

$10,000.

The third most frequent viola-
tion was public drunkenness,
although it showed nearly a 50-
percent decrease in the number
of violations handled in 1981
from the 1980 figures. Chief Kir-
by attributed the decline in part
to new rulings concerning the
laws. “The person must pose
some sort of a threat to either
himself or the public before we
can arrest him now.’’ Kirby ex-
plained. The old law simply
held inebriation as suitable

time for him in making this
decision and in viewing houses,
ideally, without the ‘‘fronts’’
which fraternities often create.

Nevertheless, with a delayed
Rush, fraternities would lose an
estimated $1,000 a month in
revenue in the first term of the
year. Moreover, fraternities
would be ‘‘supporting freshmen

socially with only the
limited dués of present house

members by which to entertain
potential freshman pledges.

Both Vetterlein and Dan Mur-
phy, Assistant Dean of Students
for Fraternity Affairs, fear that

EC Sustains
Debate Over

Membership

by Ben Jarratt
The Executive Committee

debated a proposal Monday
night that would add two new
members to this governing
body.

The honor system functions
would change slightly as the
two members of the investigat-
ing team looking into honor
violations would not participate
in the hearings on that case.
Currently, they participate in
hearings.

The proposal, introduced last
week by third-year Law Rep.
Morgan Griffith, called for
representatives to be added to
the freshmen and second year
law classes. Griffith stated ‘‘the
primary purpose of this pro-
posal is to get the two members
of the investigative team set off
from the hearings. Griffith is
concerned with the possibility
of pre-trial prejudice by some
members of the E.C.

Review:

‘Seduction’ Off The Mark

by Todd Jones

According to the current ads
for The Seduction, Morgan
Fairchild is billed as a woman
alone, terrified, trapped like an
animal. But now she’s fighting
back with the only weapon she
has — herself! If that weapon is
her acting ability, Morgan is in
serious, serious trouble.

Fairchild has broken into the
world of cinema with The
Seduction. In this film she plays
a TV newscaster who is follow-
ed by a degenerate.

‘Breaking into the movies’’
might be a bad choice of words.
‘Crashing’ would be more ap-
propriate. Fairchild proves in
this movie that while she can
take off her clothes, she can’t do
much else. She acts worried by
looking off-screen. She acts
seductive by taking off her
clothes and then looking off-
screen. She acts concerned by
glancing in a mirror and then
looking offscreen. She has an
especially ‘touching’ scene
where she breaks down on na-
tional television, begins to cry,
and then looks off-screen.

Her lover is Michael Sar-
rizan, who spends most of his
time getting mad. He realis-
tically comes to the conclusion
that the only way to rid his lover
of this pest is to blow him away.

The pest who bothers Fair-
child is Derrick, played by An-
drew Stevens. Stevens pesters
Fairchild by calling her, taking
photos of her constantly and

Background:

The Men

Steve Wolf (Bass) — Of all the
actively engaged bass players
in and around the Washington
rock. scene, Steve Wolf has
perhaps the most colorful
background, and is undeniably
one of the most highly regarded
instrumental performers. Bar
none. He has come a long way
from the reggae and _ pro-
gressive jazz bands which pro-
vided his introduction to the
world of live music. Steve has
since performed with Bill
Holland and Rent’s Due, Prin-
cipato, Kennedy and Wolf, Dan-
ny Gatton and the Redneck Jazz
Explosion, The Catfish Hodge
Band and the Cheek-To-Cheek
Allstars. When the Nighthawks
needed a relief bass player for
the interned Jan Zukowski, they
called on Steve (who toured
with the Hawks for over three
months). In addition, Steve
plays on Bill Holland’s first
albums, both of Danny Gatton’s
albums and the new Catfish
Hodge album, Bout With The
Blues.

Larry Taylor (Drums,
Vocals) — is a popular Florida

following her around. It ap-
pears that he is quite mentally
unbalanced and goes from bad
to worse. He spends his time
looking crazy.

Derrick occasionally goes in-
to Fairchild’s house and then
walks around wearing only a
towel. In another scene, he is
content to sit nude in front of
her pictures. Luckily, he only
starts to fantasize and the scene
quickly changes.

He even spends as much time
as Morgan taking his shirt off.
This is probably due to the fact
that he sweats constantly.
Strangely enough, Stevens was
probably the best actor in the
movie. He spent most of his
time taking off his clothes, or
watching Morgan take off hers
and it is possible that in the
right film he could have done a
good job.

Also in the film is Fairchild’s
best friend, who walks through
the film in the ugliest clothing
imaginable. Her deep moving
revelations stir the hearts of all
viewers.

There is a psychologist who
determines that Derrick is
crazy by flipping a coin. A
policeman advocates getting a
gun and shooting Derrick. The
cop gets upset with Michael
Sarrizan by telling him not ‘‘to
get his Phi Beta gander up.”’

The film was written and
directed by David Schmueller
who probably will not go far.

could be deemed imaginative.
Rarely does one see a film in
which the walls change colors
while you are watching them.
The clothing changes color as
well.

The casting was by that bas-
tion of creative excellence, ‘‘B
and J Casting.’’ Somehow they
managed to find the same ex-
tras used in Dawn of the Dead,
and had them standing around
staring — usually directly into
the camera so their parents
could recognize them, or look-
ing creatively offscreen — pro-
bably trying to imitate Fair-
child.

In short, this movie doesn’t
make it. The script has Fair-
child spending one-third of her
time looking off screen, one-
third of her time saying the
word ‘“‘Brandon’”’ and one-third
of her time taking off her
clothes. Even the nude scenes
are unrealistic. Derrick is
hiding in a closet while Fair-
child takes off her clothes and
takes a bath. The phone rings,
and Fairchild gets out of the tub
to answer it. The camera shows
us Derrick sweating, unbutton-
ing his shirt, looking at Fair-
child’s feet. Who are they kid-
ding?

If this film is representative
of what Fairchild will be offer-
ing in future films, she had bet-
ter stay on ‘Flamingo Road,”
where she can look offscreen to
her heart’s content.

Behind ‘Rockhouse’

Marty Baumann (Guitar,
Vocals) — are an outstanding,
talented and well-respected
rhythm and blues team. Their
experience includes a period of
time in what was formerly one
of the Richmond areas most
popular bands, the Sliders.

‘Rockhouse’ Comes

To The Pit Tues.

Perhaps the most timeless,
enduring musical genre to be
found on today’s _live-music
scene is the  straight-ahead
rhythm and blues/boogie style
performed by the Nighthawks,
Allstars and the Skip Castro
Band (among others). In this
now-classic tradition, a new
group from Washington, D.C.
has taken up the vanguard
—Rockhouse. Rockhouse, hand-
picked by bassist Steve Wolf,
adds new direction and style to
the time-tested rhythm and
blues-rock sound. Playing a
wide variety of classic material

of artists ranging from Elvis
Presley and Clarence Carter to
Delbert McClinton and Albert
King, Rockhouse delivers a
high energy performance from
start to finish.

A variety of strong original
songs by guitarist Marty
Baumann lifts Rockhouse out of
the “copy band” category and
moves the group to the forefront
of the up-and-coming area
rockers. To get a glimpse of the
fastest-rising star on the rock
horizon, catch a Rockhouse per-
formance Tues. Feb. 2, in the
Cockpit. Admission is $1.
SAB Dropped Only $30

For Reggae Performance

The Student Activities Board
fell $30 short of breaking even
with the Mighty Invaders con-
cert in Evans Dining Hall, ac-
cording to SAB Co-Chairman
John Martin.

The Baltimore based reggae
band ‘“‘charged $1100 for the
Jan. 15 show,” Martin said.
There were other expenses he
said which included the cost of
32 kegs of beer, five cartons of
cups, 10 security people and a
fee charged by Building and
Grounds for setting up the
stage. When all the figures were
in, the SAB lost only $30 in the
venture.

According to University
Center Subcommittee Chair-
man Bob Schmidt, the reason
for having the band in Evans
Dining Hall, as opposed to the

Cockpit, had to do with
numbers. Schmidt said, ‘‘When
we have a good quality band
like this one, we want to make it
open to many people and not
just the few that can squeeze in-
to the Cockpit.”

According to Schmidt, more
bands that might draw a big
crowd may be presented in
Evans Dining Hall in the future,
provided Dining Hall Manager
Jerry J. Darrell approves.
Schmidt and Martin were both
pleased with the large turnout
of 800 people and Martin said
that Darrell was also impressed
with the results.

Martin also noted the size of
Coke sales, saying it was the
first time soft drinks had been
offered and was a success.

ROTC Rangers Conduct

‘Operation Freeze’

It was certainly a different
kind of Friday night road trip.
The roads were dark, infernally
crooked, and led not to a citadel
of collegiate beauty but rather
to an isolated crossing site of
the flooding Pedlar River in the
Washington National Forest.

The elite Ranger company of
W&L’s Army ROTC program
was off on another night opera-
tion, testing its patrolling and
reconnaissance skills against
an aggressor force, portrayed
by senior cadets.

The 16 cadet Rangers, all of
whom have passed exacting
physical, technical and leader-
ship tests, had been planning
the Jan. 8-9 mission since before
the Christmas holidays. The
realistic scenario envisioned a
night deployment by vehicle in-
to the national forest and then a
lengthy foot patrol to gather
combat information on the

“enemy” occupiers of the
hostile zone, and to raid and

destroy a key military bridge. It
was the job of W&L senior
cadets Tony lIerardi, Russ Rec-
tor, Milton Chalkley and Doug
Linton to oppose the Rangers
-and confound their plans. All
together, 25 W&L cadets braved
the elements in “Operation
Freeze.”

Under the close supervision of
Green Beret Sergeant First
Class Alvin Davis III, the week
of Jan. 4-8 was spent in a series
of mission briefings, planning
sessions, and dress rehearsals.
Key leaders for the operation
were Andrew MacLellan, ’84,
from Flemington, NJ, who
acted as the mission com-
mander; Rick Storey, ’84, a
native of West Chester, PA, who
served as second in command
and intelligence officer, and Ed-
ward O’Brien, ’84, from Nor-
wich, NY, who served as opera-
tions chief. Richard Jones, °84,
from Atlanta, GA, and James
Nance, ’85, a native of Ft.
Lauderdale, FL, rounded out
the Ranger staff.

Throughout, the learning ob-
jectives were realistic training,
secure operations, mastery of
patrol planning and execution,
and small unit leadership. It ap-
pears these goals were attained
since, in spite of freezing
temperatures which set records
in Western Virginia, and icy
river crossings, all the cadets’
operational objectives were
secured.

Planned in great detail and
executed with unusual realism,
Operation Freeze added
another chapter to the special
efforts and determination of
Washington and Lee’s Cadet
Rangers.

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team turned in a solid
performance Saturday when
eight of its ten members placed
in the W&L College Invitational.
None of the six other schools in
the meet showed more balance
through all of the weight divi-
sions than did the Generals.

Captain Tim Valliere and
freshman Joe O’Neill took the
individual championships at the
158 and 190-pound classes,
respectively, while freshman
Jeff Dixon was the runner-up at
177. Other Generals who
managed to place were Carlton
Peebles (third at heavyweight), |
Wes Payne (fourth at 134), Greg
Kendrick (fourth at 167), Elbert
Umila and Ron Thornton
(fourth at 118).

Despite having only one in-
dividual champion, Catawba
(N.C.) College claimed its third
consecutive team title. The In-
dians compiled a score of 61 and
one-half points to edge Pfeiffer

+} College, which had 60 and three-
4} quarter points and three in-

dividual champions. Elon Col-
lege, which also had three in-
dividual champions, placed
third with 59, and W&L was
fourth at 51. Longwood (45),

i Davidson (30) and Hamnpden-

Sydney (19) rounded out the
competition.

When W&L took the court
against Roanoke last Thursday
the fans went wild. After last
season’s matchup, the stage
was set for a real shootout in
Warner Center. As the Generals
formed their warm-up drills to
the near ecstatic block of men
in the stands, the public an-
nouncer introduced the in-
famous unknown fans who
brought an even more intense
mania to the arena. This was no
normal group of fans. There are
certain sport events that are
noticeably affected by the fans
and the Roanoke game was cer-
tainly one of them.

Roanoke’s opening throw-in
was quickly converted into a
W&L basket and a thunder of
voices shook Warner Center.
This was the strength of an all-
male school. The harassment of
the other team did not die out
after the opening plays. A call
on either team brought the fans
to their feet. Whether cheering

was deafening. A foul or simple
mistake by one of the Roanoke
players incited hundreds of ac-

the mistake, “‘you, you, you.”

The crowd on the W&L side of
the court were only a few feet
out of bounds and any unfor-
tunate Maroon that drifted to
the sideline became the object
of unmitigated heckling. The ef-
fects were unmistakeable. This
was the contribution of the sixth
man.

Roanoke maintained its com-
posure though, and despite the
inspired play of the Generals
the game remained constantly
within one or two points. As the
clock ticked towards the half
the crowd quieted and the
Maroons carried a one point
lead into the locker room with
them.

bench and back on the court for

ed the coach.

| The StrengthOf The Sixth Man

mussea everything and one had
to suspect the potency of the
unknown fans half-time wham-
my. After four quick
unanswered points the stands
trembled with the same noise
level as the game’s beginning.

The referee made a ques-
tionable travelling call and the
sixth man cries, bulls--t in a
hundred defiant shouts. I
wonder what it is like to have a
guy with a black and white
striped paper bag over his head
point at you and scream.

As a one/point lead ticked
back and fourth on the
scoreboard the fans yelled
“defense’’ with the precision of
an army boot camp platoon. On
an out of bounds ball the referee
pointed toward the Generals’
end and hundreds of arms in the
stands did the same.

As the drama built in the clos-
ing seconds of the game, the
crowd stood and seemingly
refused Roanoke’s last shot of
dropping in. With the W&L re-
bound and time run out, the
sixth man poured onto the court
in a sea of jubilance.

Not to take away from Coach
Verne Canfield’s Generals.
Their game could not have been
improved upon and their
stature under the pressure is
beyond many of us. But rarely
does one witness such a
demonstration of undying and
inspiring loyalty. So to each of
the 1,133 present, whether you
had a bag over your head or not,
good game.

The Washington & Lee indoor
track program gets under way
this weekend with the running
of the Virginia Tech relays. The
team which sports an unusually
large 33 members has been
practicing for three weeks in
preparation for this week’s
meet. Although the V.P.1. meet
is an invitational and only a
select few from the squad will
attend, Head Coach Norris
Aldridge and Weight Event
Coach Frank Mirello stressed
the importance of getting an
early start. In fact since the in-
-|door season is only four meets
long, its main purpose is that of
/a warm-up for the outdoor
sai,

This does not mean that the
indoor season is treated any
‘less seriously. The indoor
| 0.D.A.C. championships are be-
‘ing held in Lexington for the
first time and W&L hopes to
capture its first indoor cham-
pionship. Stiff competition
should be provided.

By defending champion
Bridgewater and Lynchburg
College, W&L will bring defen-
ding indoor champs Keith
Kadesky in the 60-yard dash
and shot put champ John
McKee into the meet. Other
strong contenders for individual
honors are captain Alan Ar-
mitage in the 60-yard high
| hurdles, Gene Fellin in the pole

vault, Angus McBryde and John
Kelefant in the mile and captain
Russ Rector in the triple and
long jump. In addition to these
veterans a strong group of
freshmen should contribute to
the Generals’ depth, an area
that has been lacking in past
years.

The home advantage of
V.M.I. Fieldhouse for the cham-
pionship could also be a
decisive factor. In the past the
championships have been held
in the Lynchburg College facili-
ty which features 150-yard un-
banked oval that proved dif-

ficult to run on without prior ex- |

posure to the surface. V.M.I.’s
superior 220-yard banked syn-
thetic track will hopefully
produce faster times especially
for the seasoned Generals.

In the wake of the W&L foot-
ball and water polo teams’
outstanding seasons and the
basketball squad’s fine showing
thus far, the indoor track team
hopes to join in the glory of one |
of W&L’s finest athletic years.
The ’82 squad has the talent and
depth to make a legitimate run
at the title but the indoor season
is a tricky one. The shorter
distances and cramped
quarters often leave favorites
susceptable to upsets.

The quest for the champion-
ship seems to be in good hands,
but only the tape and stop watch

will tell.

Swimmers Split Meets

by Andrew P. Hoppes
The W&L swimming team
broke even in its two meets over
the weekend, losing’ to Rich-
mond on the road and trouncing
Appalachain State at the V.M.I.

pool.

With the team’s record now
Standing at 2-3, Coach
Remillard believes a_  .500
record is a realistic goal for the
team. ‘We could go undefeated
the rest of the season or only
.500,”’ said Remillard. “It just
depends on how much the swim-
mers want it. All our meets
from now on are going to be
close.”’

In the three years Remillard
has coached at W&L, the team’s
record has steadily improved.
In Remillard’s first two years
the team was 1-10 and 3-7. These
records were compiled against
primarily Division I and Divi-
sion II teams which are com-
posed of scholarship athletes.

Remillard also emphasizes
that his team makes tremen-
dous_ sacrifices, particularly
social ones, in order to compete.
Remillard stated that ‘over
Christmas break, the team
swam the equivalent of the

Chgere Move Into Second Place

by G. Bruce Potter

The shot went up. At first it
looked short, way short. But
somehow it managed to hit the
front of the rim. It then took a
high bounce into the air and hit
the back of the rim. It rebound-
ed forward and once again hit
the front of the rim. Then, after
what seemed an eternity, it fell
through the net to give the
Washington and Lee basketball
team a 62-61 victory over
Roanoke College last Thursday
night.

The shot: a 15-fouer from
just beyond the foul line. The
shooter: senior point guard
George Spears. Time left: 8
seconds. Coach Verne Can-
field’s reaction: ‘‘We have no
set plan for that situation. We
just try to get as good a shot as
possible. Spears’ takes
responsibility —he wants to take
that type of shot.”’

The Generals also defeated
Lynchburg College 77-74 and
Eastern Mennonite 84-74 to up
their record to 11-4, 5-2 in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference, where they are the sole
possessors.of second place.

Spears, who finished with 12
points, had been held scoreless
throughout the entire second
half by Roanoke’s box-and-one
defense. Until the last 28
seconds, that is. At that point,
he hit a jumper from the right
side to cut the Maroons’ lead to
one, 62-61.

Roanoke then missed the

iruut end of a l-and-1, Brian
Hanson pulled down the re-
bound and threw the outlet pass
to Spears, who dribbled upcourt
for his game-winning shot.
Roanoke managed to get off a
shot before the buzzer, but it
was off the mark and Frank Ep-
pes got the rebound.

The see-saw battle saw the

~ lead change hands 18 times, and

the biggest lead by either team
was six, by W&L, 12-6. The key
to the game, according to Can-
field, was the fact that the
Generals outrebounded
Roanoke 42-25. John Lee Graves
had 11 boards, Hanson 9, and
Eppes 8.

Hanson led the club with 16
points, and Graves added 14,
but the squad only shot 43.5%
from the floor and 61.5% from
the foul line.

Canfield expressed delight at
the turnout (1133) for the con-
test. “‘We are extremely pleas-

   

ed with the crowd’s effort and
really appreciate their con-
tribution to our success. It was
a very definite positive factor,”’
he said.

Graves’ tap-in with two
seconds remaining gave the
Generals their second last-:

minute victory in a row and
their first road win of the season

over Lynchburg 77-74. Hanson
then hit two technical free
throws after the Hornets were
called for an illegal pick on the
inbounds play to ice the game.

Lynchburg took the early
lead, was up 47-38 at halftime
and 53-40 with 17:36 to go. ‘‘We
were a little flat coming off the
Roanoke game,” admitted Can-
field. ‘‘But we had a severe talk
session at half-time, and the
team responded beautifully.
They kept believing they could
come back.”

A highlight of the game was

distance between here and
Charlottesville in practice.”

Despite the team’s dedica-
tion, it does not receive much
fan support. “The only dif-
ference between the gallery
now and during a meet is that
during a meet the lights are
on,” stated Remillard, pointing
to an expanse of empty
bleachers above the pool.

In last weekend’s meets,
W&L did not employ a “strong
line-up”? against Richmond so
as to preserve the strength of
the squad for the more impor-
tant meet with Appalachain
State. Encouraged by their
strong performance despite the
irregular line-up against Rich-
mond, the swimmers totally
dominated the Appalachain
State team, which was ranked
in the top 10 nationally for Divi-
sion II.

Of this weekend’s two meets,
Remillard views Saturday’s
meet at home with William and
Mary as the most interesting.
“William and Mary should be
an exciting meet because we

“We'll have to predict in which

Looking forward to the NCAA

have qualified to compete in the

lard expects a few more of his

An indication of W&L’s
strength is that W&L swimmers
occupy ten positions on the Divi-
sion III list of the twelve fastest
times for each event. Mike Ber-
not is ranked in three events,
Tim Rock in two events, Rand
McClain in two events and Jeff

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

F.Y.1.

A cartoon in a past issue of the Phi has evoked cries
of racism. We would like to take this moment to clear
up a few discrepancies. The cartoon, as drawn by
Markham Pyle, was not meant as a slur on Washing-
ton and Lee blacks. The idea was to emphasize how a
reggae band would be a departure from W&L’s usual
entertainment.

We deeply regret that the cartoon was
misunderstood. In no way did we mean to offend the
black students on this campus. Unfortunately, it
seems that our attempt to lampoon the S.A.B.’s
choice in music has ended up in some deep mis-
understandings. Again, we apologize for any grief this
may have caused and hope that our critics unders-
tand that in no way did we intend for the cartoon to of-
fend any minorities.

Purpose

Let us take this moment to thank the student body
for footing Arthur Miller’s speaking fee. If the 120-odd
people at Mr. Miller’s Tuesday night speech had split
his fee of $2,000, the cost would have been $15 apiece.
For those who attended, Miller was good entertain-
ment. He gave an interesting speech and the crowd

laughingly approved his interrogation of 11 student-
jurors.

In the past few years, Contact has pulled off its
share of flops. Without a strong reputation and too
many other distractions on Tuesday nights — bands
in the Cockpit, parties down the road and basketball
games — lesser-known speakers such as Arthur
Miller are doomed to smaller audiences.

Yet even if students were guaranteed of enlightened
discussion, they would still likely avoid Contact. Some
faculty members have long noted an inability on the
part of students to engage their minds outside the
classroom.

A sense of mission is necessary to a small school.
Dr. Sidney Coulling devoted his Founder’s Day
speech to discussing the mission of a liberal-arts in-
stitute, and where was most of the student body?--out
trying to get some lunch.

We cannot offer any real solution for Contact’s pro-
blem. One person suggested moving speeches to
another night. Monday night is out because the
theatres show films for half-price. Wednesday nights
are dominated by fraternity parties and Thursdays

are set aside for going down the road. We won’t even
discuss the weekend.

When asked how to corréct the faults of the media,
Arthur miller replied that he had no real plan. He said
he believed the answer could be found ‘‘in society
moving forward highly sensitized to the problem.”
We at Washington and Lee need to be sensitized to the
problem of our school’s lack of intellectual mission

and, in small ways, should work to correct the situa-
tion.

Even $67 million cannot buy us a purpose.

Foreign Study Program Offered

by Bruce Jones

Washington and Lee students
interested in study abroad have
the opportunity to forego the
usual European adventures and
spend a year in the British
Crown Colony of Hong Kong as
participants in the annual ex-
change program with Chung
Chi College.

Few other undergraduate in-
stitutions offer their students a
similar chance to experience
first-hand a meeting of East
and West such as exists in Hong
Kong, where _ traditional
Chinese society endures in the
face of ever-growing European
and American influences.

Located some ten miles from
Victoria Island in Hong Kong’s
mountainous New Territories,

Cold-Weather Complaint

Dear Sir:

As winter continues to burden
us with its frozen, snowy
crystals I find myself somewhat
hampered in my efforts to walk
safely around campus. While
only mildly irritated at first,
I’ve become increasingly ag-
gravated over the slippery,
treacherous conditions of our
walkways and_ sidewalks.
Although I consider myself a
reasonably coordinated _ in-
dividual, I am_ nonetheless
reduced to the gait of a tottering
old man as I slip, stumble and
slide into class each day. While
the Sun and a smattering of
graveling have made many of
the walkways navigable, there
still remain many precarious
and unavoidable ice-laden spots
simply waiting to trip up any
and all who must walk over
them. Can we not do something

Given the fact that chemicals '

chip the brick, might I suggest
spreading sand over these
areas which would at least pro-
vide surer footing until they
melt enough to be cleared com-
pletely. As it stands now, the
six-mile drive from my house
into town is not nearly as hazar-
dous as the walk (and I use the
term loosely) from Newcombe
Hall to the library. Indeed |
simply ask Buildings and

walks which are now the mad-
dening annoyance of more than
one aching student and faculty

relatively open ground for
Westerners with a knowledge of
the East. Though students in-
terested in Foreign Service, in-
ternational business or
academic careers would par-

Chung Chi Exchange Program,
it would prove a worthwhile and

And Not A
Penny For
Hot Water

Dear Sir:

I was very fascinated during
Lee’s birthday convocation to
learn that Washington and Lee
University has within the past
ten years come into contact
with $67-million. As I sat and
mused over this inconceivable
figure I pondered the source of
such a sum.

Then in a moment of revela-
tion I was struck by a theory
which I quickly wrote down to
submit to investigative re-
porters of the Phi so they could
check it out.

Here itis:

A substantial part of this
wealth obviously must have
been gained by cutting and
hoarding funds which in
previous years were used to
supply hot water for the
showers of the freshman
dorms!

Get to it guys.

Reflections:

Living In Big Lex

Let it not be said that
Washington and Lee isn’t ex-
tremely unique from other
higher learning institutions in
this country — its smallness, its
maleness, its remoteness, its
wealth and the fact that Robert
E, Lee’s bones rest here make it
indeed quite different.

Unique as well is the 19th cen-
tury town in which the school is
located — our Lexington.

The character of the town has
probably remained propor-
tionately the same for many
decades — a core of working
class and rednecks, a handful of
moneyed aristocrats, academi-
cians and military types at-
tracted by the two colleges, a
cluster of business and profes-
sional types and a small and
fairly inconspicuous black com-
munity. It is very Southern, and
anyone who thought sleepy little

villages no longer exist should >
spend a somnolent — some -

would say stagnant — summer
here.

Living here for four years has
allowed us to appreciate
aspects of the town that are
pleasurable —nice_ old
buildings, one decent movie
house, Old Main Street, a good
cable T.V. system, Le Cardinal,
Sweet Things, the Country Oven
and home delivery of the
Washington Post.

Less pleasant aspects? The
cops, the damnable one-way
streets, Clyde Mull, the
background muzak at the Aloha
Wok, ignorant people (which
Lexington by no means has a
premium on), and some local
“services.”

ors that save so much time until
you realize Centel is manually

And sometimes a number is

Overdue notices were mailed

you receive a bill for overdue
books you will have to pay the
accumulated fine plus a $3 ser-
vice charge per book (plus the
replacement cost of the book if
lost).

Please return overdue books
to the library before Feb. 1 and
pay the fines owed to avoid the
added expense of the bill. Fines
are doubled if not paid when the
books are returned.

 

again. And you know how it’s
real cheap to dial after 11 on
weeknights, so, if for no other
reason, you can create your
own Reach Out and Touch So-
meone commercial? Well, try it
in Lex and see how many times
it takes to get a line out at that
hour. Also try communicating
in the most rudimentary man-
ner with local operators. Why
should they be concerned when
you laid down a_ whopping
deposit so you could wait six
weeks for installation and an
outrageous monthly service
charge? They don’t care;
they’re the phone company.

They took Duck’s away from

which their establishment was
located practically threw Mr.

street and replaced them with
Jimmy Carter’s local campaign
headquarters. For anyone who
ever rapped with Duck over
beer, ate a Swissburger and
looked at Mrs. Duck’s
understanding eyes framed in
catwoman glasses, this was a
profound loss.

from its many different drafts,
all of which tried to stress cer-
tain ideas.

Truman’s speech supposedly
was aimed at defending his un-
popular decision to replace
General Douglas MacArthur as
head of the American troops in
Korea. Ryan, however, con-
tends that the speech was poor-
ly conceived, as it did not clear-
ly explain why MacArthur was
fired.

The fact that MacArthur’s
policy was insubordinate, in the
sense that he was opposed to
Truman’s desire to limit the

war to Korea and not extend it
further, never really came
through in the final, watered-
down version of the speech.
Professor Ryan concludes that
the speech was not a success
because Truman never really
told the public why he fired
MacArthur.

Professor Ryan’s third to be
published in a major journal,
was supported by a Glenn grant |
from Washington and Lee. The

W&L scored the first six
points of the game and never
trailed in the game, shooting a
blistering 64% from the field in
the first half to the Royals’
43.3%. Spears and Graves led
five players in double figures
with 19 points apiece, and Yates
added 16, Hanson 15 and Eppes
10.

Entering the Mennonite
game, Spears was leading the
ODAC in free throw shooting at
86.0% (now 84.7%), and Graves
was third at 82.9% (now 81.5%).
Hanson, who is shooting 86.7%,
did not qualify because he had
not made enough free throws.
The team is 77.5% from the
charity stripe, tops in the con-
ference.

Graves currently leads the
squad in both scoring and re-
bounding with averages of 15.5

and 7.2, respectively. Hanson is
second in both categories at 13.1
and 6.7.

Following a non-conference

game at Mary Washington
tonight, the Generals return
home for a key ODAC contest
against first-place Maryville at
8:00 p.m. Saturday in the
Warner Center. They will then
be at Emory and Henry on
Tuesday night.

The number of motor vehicle

three years. The cost of the

This figure is even more shock-

W&L Debaters Capture Tournament :

Washington and Lee debaters
Bill Thompson and Ken Nankin
took first place honors in the
junior varsity division of the
Marshall Wythe Debate Tour-
nament at the College of
William and Mary recently.

The Washington and Lee

Seventy-six people were ar-

more than 34 percent increase
over last year and a substantial
increase in what up until 1981

 

had been a gradually increasing |

trend in the number of arrests.

There were 22 accidents in|

which drinking and driving
played a part, but only two peo-
ple were actually arrested and
charged with drunk driving.

method of questioning by ask-
ing the panel, which consisted
mainly of journalism majors, to
consider whether to publish
stories on hypothetical Nazi
war criminals, gambling and
adulterous public officials and
cocaine-using judges.

Ben Hale, sophomore repre-
sentative to the Executive Com-
mittee, was asked by Miller if
he would print information link-
ing the director of the FBI to
gambling. Hale replied that he
did not think he would.

“Even if he was gambling
with Communists?’’ asked
Miller.

“Well, not if he was winning,”
said Hale.

Later, Miller accused a jour-
nalism student of recklessness.
“You sound like Werner Von
Braun, I just send ze rockets up,
vhere they come down, I do not
know!”

Another journalism student,
Darren Trigonoplus, interupted
Miller’s closing statement to
ask what the professor vropos-

 

 

 

ed instead of the present
sustem.

“Nothing,” Miller replied. ‘‘If
you are going to have a free
press, it must be heterogenous,
not homogenous.”’

“Then you have to figure in as
a cost of business a few broken
bones. If you get hung up on the
broken-bones side of the equa-
tion, you lose freedom of the
press,” said Miller.

“T don’t believe in absolutes,’’
said Miller. ‘‘All we can do as a
society is proceed forward
highly sensitized to the pro-
blem.”’

5-Man Committee P; cked

(continued from page 1)

upon fraternities with a new
Rush system and the transition
they would make in adapting to
that system could seriously
damage the W&L fraternity
establishment as a whole, Dean
Murphy believes that there are
two sides of the issue and that
the matter requires lengthy
nalysis not only from the
I.F.C., but also from the
aculty-composed Student Af-
airs Committee and the
University Council, consisting
f faculty and students alike.

Amid this recent deliberation,
he Executive Committee has
egun to investigate the subject
as well. Said E.C. President,
Eric Myers, “It is our duty to
look into all matters that affect

To Study Rush Question

our students.”’ Myers explained
that the E.C.’s position in the
matter will be to assist the
I.F.C. in searching for. a solu-
tion to the problem. ‘‘We are not
taking an active role other than
encouraging the I.F.C. to study
the system further.”’

Although discussion has
reached only limited stages as
of yet, the L.F.C. plans to ex-
amine the situation in more
detail next month. According to
Vetterlein, the I.F.C. must
‘start at the bottom.” Once the
council has studied the issue
thoroughly and devised its
recommendations, the matter
will be sent to the Student Af-
fairs Committee and to the
University Council for addi-
tional analysis.

 

 

EC

(continued from page 1)

“Having two representatives
involved in the case gives direc-
tion,” stated E.C. Secretary
Bennett Ross. ‘Without this
direction, only the president is
aware of the case and he, in ef-
fect, becomes the prosecution.”

Ben Hale, ’8 Rep., said ‘a
valuable role is played by the
investigators. They know and
help direct the case.” Griffith
responded the investigators
form a subjective opinion about
some witnesses. ‘Minor pre-
judices shift the burden of proof
to the defendant.”

E.C. President Eric Myers

asked Griffith to explain what
he meant by minor. ‘How
minor is minor, when you’re
messing with someone’s
academic career,” replied Grif-
fith.

Tom Booher, first-year Law
Rep., thought the representa-
tion issue was as strong as the
honor system issue. “I don’t
understand only one freshman
representative from the largest

class, as well as only two from
the. law school, which has three
distinct classes.’’

“Freshmen are brand-new to
the school,” stated Kreshmen
Rep. Cole Dawson. “‘It is impor-
tant to have more communica-
tion with the freshmen, as one
rep. cannot know all his class.”’

Myers commented the fresh-
man class has more members
than the entire law school. The

freshman class has 374
members; the law school has
only 347.

Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., stated the
law school has two represen-
tatives, despite three classes,
because it is close to equal
representation. An average
class at W&L has about 340
students.

‘The honor issue is import-

ant, but the class most cheated
is the freshman class,’’ stated
Hale. “This is the only concen-
trated class — they live and eat
together.”’ Ross added “‘half of
our job involves the Honor
System. There is no class

representation there.”’

Dawson mentioned an alter-
native proposal. ‘‘Add an addi-
tional freshman and law school
rep., but Jet the investigative
team sit on the hearings.”’

John Vlahoplus, ’83 Rep., mo-
tioned that the discussion be
tabled until next week. The
issue was too important to be
decided in one night. The mo-
tion carried 9-3, Myers, Ross

and Lang opposed. ~

Computer Club President Jay
O’Brien appeared before the
E.C. on the issue of allowing
computer science courses be
counted in math and science
distributions. ‘“‘New courses
and machines have been add-
ed,” stated O’Brien, ‘and I
definitely think they qualify for
distribution credit. All ‘the
courses I’ve been involved with
include math.”

Myers said he would continue
to look into the issue, and
possibly come up with a recom-
mendation to the General
Education Committee.
