By John Wells
The Executive Committee of

round of initial announcements
and appointments associated
with the beginning of a new
school year.

The body was officially sworn
in by Dean Lewis John in a brief
ceremony at the start of the
meeting. Instead of delivering
an innaugural address, E.C.
President Eric Myers got right
down to business by announcing
the dates of upcoming freshmen
and first year law elections.

Petitions for freshmen can-
didates seeking a class office, a
representative position on the
E.C. or University Council, or
first year law suudents desiring
a seat on the E.C. are due on
Oct. 12. Voting will take place

on. Oct. 19 and a run-off, if
necessary, will be held Oct. 22.

In other business, it was an-
nounced that:

— requests for student body
funds are due Sept. 23; budget
hearings are scheduled for
Sept. 29; a budget vote will be
held on Oct. 6 at 6:30 p.m., one
day after the regular E.C.
meeting.

— so far, financial outlays
have been limited to refresh-
ments procured for freshman

‘orientation. Beer, pretzels and

Coca-cola added up to approx-
imately $150.

Following regular business,
Myers invited discussion of
feedback E.C. members might
have gotten from freshmen fol-
lowing orientation, which he
characterized as a successful
event. Most of the discussion
centered on the honor system
and what was described as
reported ‘ambiguous phras-
ing” contained in it.

Junior Representative John
Vhliahoplus remarked that
many freshmen were troubled
by the “easily recognizable’
clause of the code which refers
to students who commit an in-
fraction outside of the W&L
community. Myers said that
while the words are vague, they
are highly preferable to those
used prior to last year’s revi-
sions.

Other E.C. members said
freshmen were concerned that
not reporting an honor offense
was a violation itself. Soph-
omore Representative Ben Hale
shared Myers’ opinion on the
subject, saying that turning ina
student is ‘‘a duty, but not a
bonded duty. A student owes it
to himself, his classmates and
to the school to report a vioia-
tion, but he is not bound to do
so.” Myers made it clear that
failure to report an infraction is
not in itself an honor violation.

Kresge Foundation
Donates $250,000

The Kresge Foundation of
Troy, Mich, has made a
$250,000 challenge grant to
Washington & Lee University in
support of renovation projects
for two university buildings,
Tucker Hall and Newcomb
Hall.

To meet terms of the grant,
Washington & Lee must raise
the remaining cost of the reno-
vation projects, estimated at a
total of $1.5 million. Not coun-
ting the Kresge grant, W&L has
raised $750,000 toward that cost
to date.

 

Newcomb was in full use
when classes began at W&L
Monday (Sept. 14). Offices for
22 faculty members in history,
sociology, philosophy, and
religion have been provided as
well as several.classrooms and
seminar rooms.

The Tucker Hall project is a
renovation of the university’s
former law school building. The
renovated areas accommodate
the university’s computer
center and psychology depart-
ment. The classrooms and lab-
oratories have videotape cap-

 

All monies must be raised
prior to December 15, 1981, for
W&L to qualify for the Kresge
grant.

Both renovation projects
were begun in 1980 on the two
buildings that are part of the
university’s front campus,
which was designated a Na-
tional Historic Landmark in
1972.

The project to remodel
Newcomb Hall — the 97-year-
old former commerce building
at the south end of the Colon-
nade — has resulted in substan-
tially improved facilities for
four undergraduate depart-
ments in The College, W&L’s
arts and sciences division.

There are also specially
designed areas for research
work involving animals. Offices
and classrooms have also been
provided for the university’s
language departments.

Both renovation projects are
part of Washington & Lee’s $62-
million development program,
which is to be successfully con-
cluded by the end of the year.

gram in 1977 after completing

ABC Laws
Endanger

Students

by Steve Perry

A new law passed by the
Virginia stage legislature re-
garding the sale and consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages may
have a profound effect on the
social lives of Washington & Lee
students.

Uver the summer, the state
legislature revised the Alcohol-
ic Beverage Control (ABC)
laws in an attempt to limit the
drinking rights among 18-year-
olds. In the past, 18-year-olds
could legally purchase beer at
both on-premise and off-pre-
mise locations. The new law
states that an 18-year-old may
buy beer only at on-premise
locations.

An on-premise location is one
that sells alcohol only to be con-
sumed in an establishment by
the ABC. One such example is
the W&L Cockpit. An off-pre-
mise location sells only carry-
out beverages.

When asked what the penalty
for underage drinking in Virgin-
ia was, ABC agent, E.R. Dris-
kill stated that “the maximum
fine is $1000 or 12 months in
jail.”

18-year-old students are not
the only ones who could be af-
fected by the new law, however.
Since the legal age for the con-
sumption of wine, grain and
hard liquor is 21 in this state,
those drinking illegally may
also be charged with the same
class-one misdemeanor.

Fraternities caught serving
liquor to underage people are
also guilty of the misdemeanor,
according to Driskill.

Entertainment
History One-Oh-None

by Todd Jones

Mel Brooks, the brilliant com-
edian who has written, directed,
produced, and acted in such
films as Young Frankenstein,
Silent Movie, Blazing Saddles,
and High Anxiety, has just of-
fered his latest effort, History of
the World, Part I. Unfortunate-
ly, History of the World will not
join the ranks of many of his
other films as being a truly
great movie. History of the
World is too disjointed, too slow-
moving, but mainly, not very
funny.

The film is in the form of a
series of sketches outlining
world history from the prehis-
toric ages to the French Revo-
lution. The first sequence shows
a prehistoric man, Sid Caesar,
discovering music, fire, art,
and women. It is somewhat dis-
appointing that one of the
world’s best comedians speaks
not one line, but rather, grunts
for the entire time he is in the
film.

The next major sequence
takes place in Rome during the
reign of Nero, who is played by
Dom DeLuise. DeLuise spends
~« his screen time grunting, belch-
ing, falling down, and pulling

large objects out of his rear end.
To me, this somehow just isn’t
funny. Madeline Kahn plays
Princess Nympho, and provides
most of the laughs for this sket-
ch, which features Shecky
Green, Charlie Callas, and Hen-
ny Youngman.

Another major sketch takes
place during the Spanish In-

WLUR ’81

WLUR-FM, Washington &
Lee University’s campus radio
station, will begin its 15th con-
secutive year of broadcasting
on Monday, Sept. 21.

Staffed by W&L students,
WLUR is a project of the
university's department of jour-
nalism and communications.
The station was founded in 1967
as a 10-watt, part-time opera-
tion, but it now boasts a 225-watt
stereo signal and a 19-hour
broadcast day during the
academic year.

WLUR has undergone signifi-
cant renovations over the sum-
mer. In addition to improving
the station’s physical ap-
pearance, WLUR’s broadcast-
ing capabilities have been

strates that when Brooks is fun-
ny, there is nothing funnier. On-
ly Brooks could turn one of the

enhanced by the purchase of
new production consoles and

The station, which includes
community volunteers on the
staff in addition to the W&L
students, will offer a music and
public affairs format similar to
the one that was introduced a
year ago, according to Robert
J. de Maria, WLUR station
manager and assistant profes-
sor of journalism.

In an effort to maintain the
Cockpit’s image as a leader in
live entertainment on campus,
the University Center Commit-
tee has planned ‘“Tuesday in the
Pit,’’ a series of performances
by outstanding local bands.

“Tuesdays in the Pit’? was
developed by UC Chairman Bob
Schmidt and SAB Co-Chairman
John Martin as a way to help
stretch out the UC’s budget. By
charging $1 for admission to
each of the Tuesday night per-
formances, Martin said the UC
can spend more than its $10,000
budget for entertaining.

“We're not saying that we’re
not going to have other bands,”
explained Martin. ‘‘Other
shows will still appear.”’

Martin also said the Cockpit
has undergone several changes

‘to accommodate bigger crowds,

including more seating. Over
the summer, the Cockpit was
given permission to allow pa-
trons to take alcoholic bev-
erages into the gameroom. The
Pit will also serve bar bottles.

Martin expressed hope that
the Tuesday night feature will
catch on with the student body,
thus lessening the controversy
over Wednesday night parties.
Martin noted that the Cockpit
will close at 12 midnight on
Tuesday nights.

During September, girls at-
tending Tuesday night perfor-
mances in the Pit will be able to
get beer for half-price.

Film Notes

Heavy Metal—Hailed by some as the animatedStar Wars , this
film is a disjunct series of trashy, spacy blackouts. Big on sex and
grinding heavy-metal rock. If you, too, are big on these, go to it. But
you won’t see me (lucky you). Starts Friday at the Lyric.

Arthur — Plot is non-existing in this 30’s-style comedy vehicle.
But who cares? Dudley Moore is a very, very rich drunk who’s been
raised to be funny by his valet (Sir John Gielgud). His family
wishes him to marry a rich, boring social climber, and will cut off
the cash if he balks. But Our Hero meets a shoplifting Italian girl
from Queens...and balks. Liza Mennelli, as The Girl, is way out of
her league, but Moore and Gielgud are certainly worth the money.
Opens Friday at the State.

Stripes — Bill Murray joins the Army to meet women. The Army

 

will never be the same. Occasionally amusing.

’ Sports

Generals Drop Opener

Optimism Necessary

by John Cleghorn

In the September issue of the
Sporting News Furman Bisher
wrote an article entitled ‘His
Heart is always with the Under-
dog.’’ Bisher’s point is that in
following sports his attention is
on that player or that team
which is often overshadowed.
His examples are the tailback
behind Herschel Walker,
Mohammed Ali’s opponents,
the Pat Dyes instead of the P.W.
Bryants. Unusually among the
ranks of Bisher’s underdogs he
lists ‘‘the linebacker from
Washington & Lee.”’

Although Bisher’s point ‘is
that of obscurity, he chose the
wrong year to pick on
Washington & Lee because
there are no underdog
linebackers, or tackles, or runn-
ing backs, for that matter. In
fact it will be difficult to find
any underdogs on the 1981

’ General roster because it is one

of the strongest and most ex-
perienced teams in recent W&L
history as well as being the
culmination of four previous
building years for head coach
Gary Fallon. As the Falcon puts
it: “the. aging process is now
complete.’

Undoubtedly many, students
saw Saturday’s game and are

ready to write off the Generals

‘for the remainder of the season.

But before you lose all faith

consider the factors’ involved.
Last season Gettysburg easily
defeated W&L 28-0 but this year
saw many differences other
than the score.

One of the unusual statistics
in last Saturday’s mafch was
the. use of 5 quarterbacks in one
half. Coach Gary Fallon is pos-
ed with. an unusual problem of
being very deep in quarter-
backs. Rich arene and

Jim Wenke are two senior
quarterbacks who have shared
the position for three years.
Both of these athletes have a lot
of experience and know the
General offense.

In contrast is the third
quarterback, number 5, Al
Paradise. A transfer from Har-
vard, Paradise has good size
and superior ability but lacks
the knowledge of the system.
Examining the offense Satur-
day one could not place the
blame so much on the quarter-
back shuffle as gaps in the of-
fensive line.

The right side of the line suf-
fered greatly from graduation
as the Generals lost starters
guard Jim Forte, tackle Chip
Nunnally, .and ‘center John
Hendler. On the brighter side
the Generals see the return of
tail back Chris Cavilline, a very
promising runner, and tight end
Mike Fogarty, who will provide
a threat bothas a receiver anda
runner.

On the other side of the ball
lies the Strength that kept the
Generals in the ballgame. With
the offense sputtering it was up
to the defense to keep th> score

. close. The General defense was .

the toughest in the ODAC
against the run last year and
returns in full strength. .

What one must remember is
that this was only the Generals’
debut. Gettysburg. returned 16
of 22 starters and, in coach

Fallon’s opinion, is animproved .

team over last year’s. So for
any fans who feel their faith

’ starting to waiver it is only fair
to keep the book open on the.
_ Generals and Head Coach Gary

Fallon and to support them in
their effort to bring respectable
football back ‘to Washington &
Lee.

by Dale Park

The Washington & Lee varsi-
ty football team opened up its
1981-82 season last Saturday
with a disappointing 20-7 loss to
Gettysburg’ College on Wilson
Field.

The Bullets, a team which

_crushed the Generals 28-0 last

season, proved overpowering to
W&L once again. Gettysburg

struck early in the first period, |

turning a pass interception off
senior quarterback Jim Wenke’
into a touchdown drive. W&L
responded in the third quarter
as senior quarterback Rich
Hachenburg (one of five
quarterbacks coach Gary
Fallon would use in the first
half) hit senior tight-end Mike
Fogarty on a nineteen yard
scoring toss.

Fogarty’s touchdown proved

to be the only W&L score of the -

day. Several minutes later Get-
tysburg quarterback Brett Gipe
scrambled in from six yards,
capping an eleven play, 62 yard
scoring drive which put the
Bullets ahead to stay 14-7. Get-
tysburg scored again in the
opening seconds of the fourth
quarter as Gipe hit ‘tight end
Pat Lubin with an eleven yard
TD pass (the point after at-
tempt missed. )

The Generals had the chance
to make the game close. The
Bullets fumbled three times in
the fourth quarter and three
times W&L came up empty as
the Gettysburg defense sealed
off the Generals’ running at-

tack.

‘“‘We were afraid to play the
passing type of catch-up foot-
ball,’ offered Fallon, now in his
fourth year as head coach,
“because often times you play
right into the other team’s
hands.”’-

Line play proved to be the key "
to the Generals’ problems, A
tough Bullet offensive line open-
ed the holes that allowed
Gettysburg to gain 287 yards
rushing (to W&L’s 108), while a
young W&L offensive line was

‘dominated by an experienced

   

Bullet defense.

“We were aware of our lack
of line experience,” admitted
Fallon. ‘It was a concern we
had. Our veteran on the offen-
sive line (sophomore ’ guard)
Car] Peebles wasn’t even in the
game. This left us with inex-
perienced players in four of the
five line positions.”’

In explaining his decision to
use five quarterbacks in the
game, Fallon commented:
“I’m trying to feel my way out
of our quarterback problem. I
feel the best way to do this is to
look at all of our talent.”’

This Saturday the Generals
will take on their first ODAC
rivals of the season when they
travel to Emory, Virginia, to
face the Emory and Henry
Wasps. Game fime is 1:30 P. m.
on Fullerton Field.

Young Polo Team Opens Friday

by G. Bruce Potter

Coming off what Coach Page
Remillard called a ‘‘building
year,’”’ the Washington & Lee
water polo team will open its
season with the Revue Fall
Classic at Twombly Pool this
weekend.

The Generals compiled a
17-14 record last year, but the
team had alot of freshmen and

did not lose a single letterman:

to graduation. ‘‘Last year was a
building year. We dedicated it
to a lot of fundamentals and
educating the team in team
strategy and defenses — all the
little ingredients for the devel-
opment of a complete water
polo player.”’

By John Harrison
A wet playing field and a
preseason training program
that lasted just eleven days
were the biggest factors that
made most of yesterdays
season opener for the Wash-
. ington and Lee soccer team a
less than exciting 1-0 victory
over Mary Washing on College.
Mary Washington w is expected
to be one of the weal est oppone-
nent on the Gener: | schedule.

This was evident in ts inability —

~ to put pressure oi jthe W&L
defense for more th 1a minute
at a time; but the tain along
with the limited preseason pro-
gram, and a strong perfor-

mance by Mary Washington’s

goalie prevented the Generals
from running up the score.

was also named to the All-
America team for swimming,
making him only the second
athlete at W&L to make Ail-
America squads in two different
sports. Rock and Eric Peterson,
a junior transfer from Georgia
Southern, will captain this
year’s team.

Remillard is happy with the
progress the 17 team members
have made so far and feels that
this team will be “much
superior” than last year’s
group. ‘‘We’re a year older, and
we picked up in September
right where we left off last
November,” he said.

“Our goal this year is to do

He also feels that the team

has a good chance of finishing in
the top four in the Eastern
championships. The top two fin-
ishers in that event will com-
pete for the national crown in
Long Beach, Ca.

Summing up this year’s
squad, Remillard said, ‘‘the

“unit will control our destiny.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Rush 1981

As if the freshman class did not have enough pro-
blems with cramped living quarters, now they have
been subject to one of the least efficient rush produc-
tions inrecent memory. A failure on the part of the In-
terfraternity Council to prepare this year’s freshmen
for the rush experience has left many a freshman
walking around houses like lost cattle.

The rush problem began when the IFC imposed a
‘‘no-contact”’ rule which, in effect, separated the
freshman class from a majority of the up-
perclassmen. Because of the no-contact rule,
freshmen and fraternity members are unknown quan-
tities tp each other. Without any chance to really look
at a house, the first few rush dates could become total
losses.

 

Second, the freshmen were never told how to set up ‘

their rush dates. We know of one instance where a
freshman picked his houses alphabetically. Another
freshman chose according to academic standing.
Such hit-and-miss tactics are not what rush is design-
ed for.

While academics must certainly be the first priority
at this university, the social life must not be neglected
either. It does not take a wise man to recognize that
fraternities are the social hub of this university.
Therefore it makes sense to inform our freshmen as
best we can about the fraternity system at W&L.

No-contact rules and the non-clarification of how to
rush are two examples of how the system can be

damaged.
The New Law

It’s a Saturday night and your house is sponsoring a
grain party and a band. Suddenly, you see a Lex-
ington Police Department squad car pull up in front.
The windows of the house are shut, so you figure a
noise violation is unlikely. Suddenly, the officer starts
asking for i.d.’s. Within minutes, he is taking the
president of the house and three other would-be par-
tiers down to headquarters.

The party is over.

As unlikely as all this sounds, it may indeed become
reality in the near future if the local agency of the
Alcoholic Beverage Control and the police depart-
ment decide to enforce the state’s new ABC law.
Under the new law, only 19-year-olds and up can drink
beer off premises. Grain and other brand liquors still
remain available only to people atleast 21 years of
age.

The threat of a liquor crackdown has always ex-
isted, but only now does it seem close to happening.
What makes all this such a threat is that ABC agents
or police officers may enter a fraternity and ask for
id.’s. If the fraternity is serving beer or liquor to peo-
ple underage, then the party can be legally shut down.
Moreover, the individual or the fraternity can face a
fine up to $1000 and a possible jail sentence.

Just when and if this crackdown takes place is
anyone’s guess. Most likely it would occur when
police begin checking for noise violations. Police will
also be looking for public drinkers, as some people
may have discovered last night.

The important thing to remeber is that ABC and the
police department are not seeking to force Lex-
ington’s fraternities into capitulation. ABC Agent
E.R. Driskill has even indicated that he does not want
to spend his time checking i.d.’s at houses. But if
drinking and public rowdiness get out of hand, then
the local authorities will have no choice but to enforce
the law.

| Comment: Don’t Rush Rush

by Todd Smith

Freshmen arrive and for one
week the campus is friendly and
charged with a sense of purpose
and expectation. They talk of
the honor code and classes, and
say hello to each other on the
colonnade.

Then the upperclassmen
arrive.

They don’t speak when they
pass. They talk of rack-dates
and easy B’s. Then comes Rush.
Upperminks divide underminks
into herds of prime, choice, and
sausage links. Houses fight over
the few; they dirty-rush and
backbite, and even friends part
when their paths cross over the
same freshman.

One dorm counselor laments
that noone really looks at these
freshmen with intentions to
shape them into men of honor
and intelligence. Their heads
are the malleable clay, joked
another counselor, that frater-
nities shape into funnels to pour
beer into.

Freshmen stumble around
IFC regulations to learn a sliver
of information about frater-
nities before they sign up for the
all-important first Rush Date.
Frats scramble for the big face-
men, gambling all on first im-
pressions. Freshmen ask
“what’s wrong with me?” when
they are not asked back.

Could we possibly find a
worse way to introduce a group
of people to Washington and
Lee? Freshminks who wake up
in the bathroom after their first
grain party must think not.
Frat-rats who work double
over-time to separate the wheat
from the chaff before the end of
the first week of classes must
think not.

Why not push Rush back to
late October of November?
Some schools delay Rush until
second semester; why not
W&L?

A candid answer from the
frats might be that we cannot
afford to prolong Rush a single
week. The intense process of
luring the elite of a class can
wreck GPA’s and ruin house

budgets.
There are other answers.
Freshmen, it is said, need a

place to party. They need so-

meone with whom to play I-M
football. They need transporta-
tion down the road.

But don’t we really mean that
we need the freshmen to party
with us, that we need them to
play football for us, and that we
need them to rely on us to get
around?

The effect of delayed Rush
would be to strengthen the unity
of the freshmen class. If the
freshmen cannot survive two
months without the slowed
social calendar that they will
nevertheless have to get used
to, let them turn to each other

for the solution.

Fraternity members have
noted the difficulty in avoiding
freshmen with “latent tenden-
cies” towards becoming obnox-
ious brothers, and of knowing
who they are missing in their
search for bid material. A de-
layed Rush would lessen the
reliance upon first impressions.

Above all, a delayed Rush
would rescue freshmen. They
have come to a small school on-
ly to be inflicted with our most
impersonal institution within
the first week.

As far away as Dartmouth
and as close as Charlottesville,
fraternities wait before rushing
their incoming students. We at
Washington and Lee should too.

Freshmen
to Receive

Drinking

Information

Entering freshmen at
Washington & Lee University
will receive information about
alcohol abuse as part of the
general freshman orientation
program for the first time this
fall.

According to H. Robert
Huntley, associate dean of
students at W&L, the informa-
tion will be disseminated by
way of the dormitory counsel-
ors, upperclassmen who super-
vise and provide guidance for
the first-year students.

“As part of the standard
training sessions we hold for
dormitory counselors in early
September, we will be including
one unit on alcoholism and em-
phasizing the role that the dor-
mitory counselors can play in
helping alert freshmen to possi-
ble problems,”’ Huntley said.

The training session for
counselors will be based upon
materials from BACCHUS
(Boost Alcohol Consciousness
Concerning the Health of
University Students), a
volunteer student organization
chartered on campuses to pro-
mote responsible alcohol-
related behavior.

The alcohol awareness por-
tion of freshman orientation is
in response to recommenda-
tions made last spring by the
university’s executive commit-
tee, the chief agency of student
government at W&L.

Citing its concern over the
growing’ ‘problem of alcohol
abuse among college students
throughout the nation, the ex-

‘History’
(continued from page 2)

provide one of the funniest
scenes ever on film.

The last scene takes place
during the French Revolution,
which is being led by Chloris
Leachman. Harvey Korman is

entertaining as a member of the
French elite. However, after
the tenth time that Brooks, as
Louis XVI, grabs a woman and
says “It’s good to be king,’’ one
wishes the sketch, as well as the
movie, would finish.

Brooks plays six different
roles himself, and comes out
looking more like a ham in his
first home movie than the com-
ic genius he is.

In short, History of the World.
Part I, features Mel Brooks and
almost all of his usual compa-
nions. However, unlike his pre-
vious films, this one fails to
entertain. It is possible that the
truly die-hard Mel Brooks fan
will come out of the theatre with
a positive impression, but I
doubt it.

Kresge Foundation Makes Donation

had attracted $21.5-million in
commitments as of July 30.
‘The generosity of the Kresge
Foundation will bring us a long
way toward completing the
fund-raising for these two im-
portant projects,’’ said
Washington & Lee president
Robert E.R. Huntley in announ-
cing the university’s receipt for
the challenge grant. ‘“‘We ac-
cept the challenge with both
gratitude and confidence.”’

The Kresge Foundation con-
sidered 1,551 qualified pro-
posals in 1981 and awarded new
grant commitments _ totaling
$33,354,000 to 176 charitable
organizations, including Wash-
ington & Lee.

The majority of those grants
were toward projects such as
Washington & Lee’s which in-
volved construction or renova-
tion of facilities. Most grant
recipients had, like W&L, rais-
ed initial funds toward their

respective projects before re-
questing assistance from the
Kresge Foundation.

The Kresge Foundation was
created solely by the personal
gifts of the late Sebastian S.
Kresge. Since 1924, appropria-
tions of over $416-million have
been made to institutions in the
areas of higher education,
health care and related ser-
vices, the arts and humanities,
social welfare, science, conser-
vation and religion.

That study, conducted by
members of a W&L class in
social science research me-
thods, was based upon a ques-
tionnaire answered by about
half the undergraduate student
body.

Among its findings, the
study concluded that students’
consumption of alcohol varies
considerably (from 7.6 percent
who said they do not drink at all
to 11 percent who said they con-
sume more than 25 drinks per
week) and that drinking is
“almost entirely a_ social
phenomenon, occurring at
group events” at W&L.
