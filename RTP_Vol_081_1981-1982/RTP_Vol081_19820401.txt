Lukes To Return|
For Spring Term

back at school for the spring

by J.R. Smith

After listening to Student Ac-
tivities Board Co-Chairman
John Martin’s plans for spring
entertainment, the Executive
Committee allocated additional
funds to the S.A.B. in the Mon-
day night meeting of the E.C.

To offset the S.A.B.’s_pro-
jected budget deficit of nearly
$3,000 and to allow for a spring
program of music, the E.C.
moved to deposit $4,537 in the
board’s account.

This money will come from
the E.C.’s Dreyfus money
market account, which will
bring around $3,800, and an
allocation from the Student
Reserve Fund to make up the
difference. $4,000 will remain in
the reserve fund after the
withdrawl.

Martin explained his plans for
the spring, which include an ap-
pearance by Skip Castro on the
first Tuesday of the term, and
an appearance by the
Nighthawks in the following
Friday. Both of the events
would be ‘‘basically  self-
supporting,” in the words of
Martin. Other bands tentatively
slated to appear are the
Michael Guthrie Band, the
Monarchs, The Deal, and The
Convertibles.

“Tuesday in the Pit,” which

 

Martin referred to as a pro-
gram he would like to see con-
tinue after his graduation, could
include such groups as the Good
Humor Band and Bruce Olsen
and the Offenders.

Martin also said the movie
program would continue if the
S.A.B. could show two x-rated
films in order to make a profit.
The place for showing the films
has not been settled since du-
Pont auditorium was closed
following problems over the last
porn film.

Martin also discussed a possi-
ble spring concert, tentatively
slated for May 8. The concert
would follow the lacrosse game
with Hofstra, and would feature
a big-name band. The funds for
this concert could possibly
come from the Interfraternity
Council and the junior class.

In other matters, the E.C.
heard reports from the Calyx,
Focus and the Mock Convention
Committee.

Calyx Editor Jack Huskin and
Business Manager Scott Fitz-
gerald reported that the year-
book is close to completion.
“We have one set of ptoffs to
look at, then it’s all finished,”’
said Huskin. He added that the
tentative date for the Calyx’s
release to the student body is
May 25.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Student Condemns

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A Good Move

For all the criticism that it receives for its fiscal
policy, the Executive Committee did a serious right
Monday by giving more money to the Student Ac-

~ tivities Board. Rather than dressing down the S.A.B.
for its loss of money, the E.C. did the only just thing —
it gave the entertainment group enough money to
keep the campus in music for the rest of the year.

We do not mean to advocate fiscal disaster. The
S.A.B. lost its shirt, and then some, over Fancy Dress.
But to deprive the campus of spring entertainment for
the mistakes of February and March seem unjust.
The E.C. did the right thing — it guaranteed that
students would be given entertainment for the spring.

We have criticized the E.C. for not accomplishing
much this year. Monday night’s allocation of funds for
the S.A.B. may not go down in campus history as
earth-shattering, but it does demonstrate that the
E.C. at times works in the interest of the student
body. And this is the way student government is in-
tended to be.

THE RING-TUM PHI WILL
NOT BE PUBLISHED AGAIN
UNTIL APRIL 22.
HAVE A GOOD BREAK.

 

  
    
   
 

Dear Sir:

In reading last week’s
editorial in the Ring-tum Phi, I
was at first struck by the in-
telligent thoughts on the issue of
campus security. Had good
journalism creeped into our
paper? A few paragraphs later

’T soon saw that this was not to

be.

The statement that Wash-
ington and Lee has little more to
offer than an honor system is an
outrage, and an insult to the en-
tire W&L community. We have
an administration that deeply
cares about its students, as fine
a faculty that one may find on
the undergraduate level, and a
student body both so talented
and diverse, that it attacks-
Academics, Parties - and
Lacrosse with equal en-
thusiasm (well, almost equal
enthusiasm). Not to mention a
beautiful campus and a proud
and rich tradition.

Maybe the person(s) respon-
sible for this editorial is con-
nected with the New York

Big Lex’s
Dear Sir:

I am happy to announce that
the inhabitants of Lexington
can relax. In spite of the recent
suspensions of several mem-
bers of the illustrious Lexington
Police Department, a few
fearless officers continue to do
their jobs...relentlessly. That’s
right, there is no need to fear a
lawless society taking over in
Lexington. -

Case in Point:

Time: 4:35 A.M.

Date: 26 March 1982

Suspect: 21 year old male
Caucasian

Occupation: Student

The suspect was spotted by
Lexington Police Department
Officer Charles Carpenter turn-
ing onto South Main Street, win-
dows up, obeying all traffic
regulations and ordinances.
There was, however, one viola-
tion of the civil code which of-
ficer Carpenter could not let go
unchecked. Indeed, in the of-
ficer’s opinion, this breach of
the legal system was of great
enough magnitude to disregard
the police dispatcher’s call re-
questing assistance in transpor-
ting an injured citizen to the
hospital, which could be heard
on the radio as Carpenter stop-
ped and approached the
suspect’s car. Grand larceny?
Rape? Murder? All of the
above??! No!
Carpenter issued the suspect a
police summons to the Com-
monwealth of Virginia City
Court for a violation of the noise
ordinance. That’s right, the
suspect’s car stereo was turned
up too loud and without warn-
ing, he was issued a noise viola-
tion.

Times. They also seem to have
an altered perception of W&L.
I’m proud of my school, as I
know most other members of
the Washington and Lee com-
munity are. Maybe the writer of

the editorial might consider
another school. How about a
community college offering
remedial journalism courses.

Hasty Judgement?

Dear Sir:

This is in response to your
editorial concerning ‘‘Cops and
Robbers” in last week’s issue of
the Ring-tum Phi.

Can You Honestly Judge?
“Pray don’t find fault with the
man who limps or stumbles
along the road,

Unless you have worn the shoes
he wears or struggled beneath
his load.

There may be tacks in his shoes
that hurt, though hidden from
view

  

Finest Str

I have spent three and a half
years in Lexington: Fall,
Winter, Spring, and Summer. I
have heard cars with open
windows and far louder stereos
parade down Main Street past
legions of Lexington Police
Department officers unhamper-
ed. It does my heart good to see
top-flight officers like Charles

Or the burden he bears placed
on your back might cause you to .
tumble too.

Don’t snear at the man who’s
‘down today, unless you have
felt the blow

That caused his fall, or felt the
shame that only the fallen
know.

You may be strong, but still the
blows that were his, if dealt to
you

In the self-same way at the
same time might cause you to
stagger too.
Don’t be too harsh with the man
who sins or pelt him with words
or stone,

Unless you are sure, yes, doubly
sure that you have no sins of
your own

“Author Unknown”

ike Again

Carpenter finally get on the ball
and put an end to this reckless
crime wave, despite his now
limited team of reinforce-
ments. Please, hold true to this
newly established precedent.
Three cheers to the Lexington

Law School Helps

Students in several Rock-
bridge County high schools and
middle schools are receiving in-
struction in various aspects of
the American legal system
courtesy of a Washington and
Lee University law school
fraternity.

Members of Phi Alpha Delta
Law Fraternity. are par-
ticipating in the fraternity’s
Juvenile Justice Program, a na-
tionwide effort to educate youth
in the role of law in American
society.

‘We are attempting to show
the students in area high
schools and middle schools that
the legal system is not exactly
what they see on television
reruns of Perry Mason or
Adam-12,”’ explained David
(Freedi) Friedfeld, a second-
year law student at Washington
and Lee and coordinator of the
Juvenile Justice Program at
W&L.

According to Friedfeld, 14
members of Phi Alpha Delta
have volunteered their time to
participate in the program.

Friedfeld heads a steering
committee that consists of two
other second-year law students,

Lee Moise and Michael Bon.
merito along with W&L law pro-
fessor William Geimer, Lex-
ington High School principal
Glenn Stark, and Judge Robert
Culpepper, judge of the juvenile
and domestic relations district
court in Rockbridge County.

The program was six months
in the planning stages before
the first presentations were
made in February when eighth-
grade civics classes at Parry
McCluer Middle School in
Buena Vista received a week of
instruction in the criminal
justice system.

So far, the Phi Alpha Delta
members have given similar
presentations at Parry McCluer
High School, Lexington High
School, Rockbridge High
School, and Brownsburg Middle
School.

All high schools and middle
schools in Rockbridge County
were approached by Friedfeld
‘last fall and were offered 12 dif-
ferent topics from which the
school officials could choose.
The topics ranged from crimi-
nal justice, which requires five
class periods to present, to a
two-period discussion of correc-
tional facilities.

Scholarship Honors Johnson

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a $50,000 gift
from William S. Rosasco III of
Milton, Fla., for the creation of
an endowed scholarship that
will honor Lewis Kerr Johnson,
professor emeritus at W&L.

To be named the Johnson-
Rosasco Scholarship, the fund
is the latest in a long list of
honors for Johnson, who retired
from active teaching in 1973
after 40 years on the faculty at
Washington and Lee.

Johnson, who served as head
of the commerce department at
W&L from 1950 until 1968,
aiready has one scholarship
named in his honor: The L.K.
Johnson Scholarship, which
was created in 1974 by many of
Johnson’s friends and former
students and is awarded toa ris-
ing junior majoring in business
administration accounting.

Johnson was also honored in
1979 by thé establishment of an
endowed professorship — the
Robert G. Brown Emeritus Pro-
fessorship — which Johnson

W&L Baseball Mired InSlump —

by Andrew P. Hoppes
Washington and ‘Lee’s
baseball team dropped a 7-4
decision to Randolph-Macon on

Tuesday to extend a losing

streak to four games.

Since the Generals last tasted
victory against Bridgewater,
they have lost 6-3 to Lock
Haven, 5-1 to Randolph-Macon,
10-7 to Duke, and 7-4 to
Randolph-Macon to drop their
record to 46.

‘“‘We’re not losing confidence
in ourselves. We still think we'll
make the tournament. Mentally
we’re not there everyday,
though,’”’ observed coach Jim
Murdock.

Another factor Murdock cited
as fueling the skid was a lack of
hitting with men on_ base.
Through ten games, the
Generals have left 82 men on
base.

In the loss to Lock Haven last
Wednesday, the Generals fell
behind 3-0 after two innings and
never recovered in losing 6-3.

W&L did manage to mount a
comeback in the ninth inning,
however. With two outs, Chris
Cavalline ripped an RBI double.
Jeff Haggerty followed with an
RBI single, but it was too little,
too late.

The next day, the Generals
lost 5-1 at Randolph-Macon in
an ODAC contest. Rich
Hachenberg absorbed the pitch-

ing loss.

“We only had three or four
hits. We also made some costly
errors in the field,”’ noted Mur-
dock. '

In a Saturday slugfest with
Duke, the Generals nearly
upset the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference team, but fell 10-7. ‘‘We
scared them,” remarked Mur-
dock.

After Duke had scored eight
times in the first three stanzas,
the Generals rallied in the third
to make the score 8-7. Both
Tripp Brower and Chris
Cavalline ripped two-run
homers in the inning.

The Generals could not over-
come their defensive mistakes,
though. W&L committed five
errors which let in three runs,
and W&L hurlers yielded three
home runs on the windy day.

In Tuesday’s game, the all too
familiar pattern continued.
W&L fell behind 6-1 to
Randolph-Macon and then
could not catch the Yellow
Jackets in the 7-4 loss.

Macon lit up Washington and
Lee starter Billy White for six
runs in the first four innings. A
mixture of walks, errors and
some very hard hits by Macon
contributed to the defeat.

W&L fought back, however,
with two runs of their own in the
bottom half of the fourth to
close the gap to 6-3.

Generally Speaking

 

With Mike Walsh and Dave
Warrenfeltz on base after a pair
of singles, Brower singled to
center to score Walsh. When
Brower tried to advance to se-
cond on the play, the Yellow
Jackets committed a throwing
error that allowed Warrenfeltz
toscore.

The lead narrowed to 6-4 after
the sixth when W&L pushed
across another run.

After walks to Haggerty and
Walsh, Warrenfeltz forced
Walsh to second, putting run-
ners at the corners. Haggerty
scored when Brower’s grounder
was bobbled by the Randolph-
Macon shortstop.

Meanwhile, White had settled
down after his rocky start. He
blanked the Yellow Jackets for
four straight innings before
yielding a final run in the ninth.

W&L threatened to tie the
score in the bottom of the ninth,
but again came up short.

Mark McLaughlin reached
base on an error and Jody Har-
ris lined a single to left to start
the inning. They were left
stranded, however, as the next
three Generals were retired.
Cavalline’s two-out flyball was
hauled down just short of the
fence.

The Generals met Col; ‘te at
home yesterday in thier final
action before exams and will
return to the diamond on April
13 at Hampden-Sydney.

 

“We're not losing confidence
in ourselves.”

Yes, W&L, Lexington Does Have A Golf Course

by G. Bruce Potter

At the midway point of the
spring sports schedule, let’s
take a look at what the various
Washington and Lee sports
teams have accomplished so far
and what they can look forward
to after spring break:

Golf

You would think that golf
would be the most popular sport
at a supposedly rich and preppy
institution like W&L, but that is
certainly not the case. In fact,
one student was heard to say
recently, ‘“You mean Lexington
has a golf course?”’

Well, they do, and coach Buck
Leslie has an outstanding golf
team led by senior captains Jim

=U ULL

Kaplan and Bill Alfano. The
squad is 3) and placed third
among Division III teams in a
North Carolina tournament
earlier in the month and tenth
at an open event (any division)
at James Madison University.
They look very strong for the
ODAC championships April 26
and 27 at Hampden-Sydney.
Meanwhile, they will compete
in the Virginia Tech ‘‘Gobbler
Classic” over the break.
Tennis

Take a look at the record of
the tennis team, 4-9, and one
would assume that they were
having an “‘off’’ year. But that
is far from the truth as most of
those losses have come against

Nominations for the

Dean Gilliam Award

are due in the Executive Committee room
by 6:30 p.m. on Monday, April 19th

The award is given to the student who has made the greatest
contribution to the university. The selection will be made by
the undergraduate members of the E.C.

Division I and II competition.
Actually, the squad only has
five Division III teams on its
schedule before the ODAC tour-
nament at Washington and Lee
April 30-May 1.

Led by Craig Cannon and Wes
Yonge and balanced by
freshmen Stephen Bendheim
and Andy Haring, the squad will
go south for the break to meet
some tough competition.
However, coach Gary Franke
believes that the difficult op-
ponents will better prepare the
team for tournament time.

Lacrosse

Not only does the lacrosse
squad play tough teams, they

everyone is well aware unless
they’ve been buried in the
library studying for finals the
last three weeks.

Ranked eighth in the nation,
according to the latest
U.S.I.L.A. Division I poll, the
Generals own a 5-1 record, the
loss an 11-10 overtime heart-
breaker to Navy. Employing a
patient, ball-control offense and
a tenacious defense, the squad
seems to have sét a pattern of
playing the game close for
three-and-a-half quarters

before putting their opponent
away.

_The most recent example was
the 13-12 overtime defeat of
Towson State last Saturday.

John Tunney, junior mid-

‘Fine Comeback’ Gives Lax 13-12 Overtime Win

by John Harrison

“It was a fine comeback in a
tough situation,” said head
lacrosse coach Jack Emmer in
describing Washington and
Lee’s 13-12 overtime win over
Towson State last Saturday.

Senior midfielder John San-
cilio forced the game into the
extra period with his third goal
of the day with only 25 seconds
left in regulation time. The
Generals’ leading goal scorer
then put in the sudden-death
winner at the 1:39 mark by tak-
ing an inbounds pass at the top
of Towson’s box and moving
past defenseman Rich Murphy
before beating Tiger goalie
Mark Williams from ten yards.

The victory made W&L 5-1
and raised its national ranking
in the latest poll to eighth.
Towson dropped its second deci-
sion in as many games.

Although Emmer believed
that the Generals’ last match

Golf Wins
Tri-Meet

by B. Scott Tilley

Playing against bad condi-
tions and without number-one
seed Titus Harris, the
Washington and Lee golf team
still managed to defeat
Bridgewater College and
Shepherd College in a tri-meet
last Thursday to up its record to
3-0.

Jim Kaplan’s 75 paced the
squad, which turned in a five-
man team score of 395.
Bridgewater finished second at
4l7 and Shepherd third at 430.
Del Agnew carded a 79, Bill
Alfano, Bruce Blythe and Dick
Emrey turned in 80’s and Tom
Webb came in with an 81 for the
Generals.

Even with the two victories,
Coach Buck Leslie had hoped to
see a better team score turned
in. ‘‘We did play without Harris,
who was in New York, and the
conditions—wind and tough pin
placement—made it difficult.
We had to work for the 80’s.
Sometimes the course just
won't let you go.”’

prior to Spring break did not
have as much finesse and fan
appeal as have previous match-
es this season, he was pleased
with the effort put out in spite of
recent injuries at the midfield
and attack positions.

“‘We have a few guys bumped
up,” said the coach while refer-
ring to Rich Schoenberg, who
had taken over for the injured
John Tunney as the team’s
leading faceoff man, and Joe
Seifert, who had six goals
before he sustained a bruised
elbow.

Tunney returned to action
against Towson after recover-
ing from an injury to the vocal
cords. ‘John got the job done
after being out for eight days,”’
remarked Emmer about the
junior midfielder.

But what impressed Emmer
above all was W&L’s ability to
be aggressive in going for loose

Sophomore Charlie Alcorn
claimed two individual events
Friday, the shot put and the
discus, to lead the squad to an
easy 94-51 victory.

The Generals won four of
seven field events and seven of
ten running competitions.
Freshman Keith Busbee paced
the way on the track by captur-
ing the 400-meter event and par-

- ticipating on the Generals vic-

torious 400- and mile-relay
squads.

Angus McBryde, 1500-meters,
Alan Armitage, 110-meter
hurdlés, Mark Pembroke, 800-
meters, and Greg Branan, 5000-
meters, also picked up in-
dividual running titles.

Busbee ran with classmates
Scott Henderson and Chris Ives
and sophomore Kevin Kadesky
to win the 400-relay in 45.4
seconds and with Henderson,
Martin and Paul Chapman to
capture the mile relay in
3:36.22.

The Generals won 10 of 17
events Tuesday to score 114
points in defeating Roanoke, 40,

having the best performance in
the conference in a specific
event after last weekend’s com-
petition. Alcorn’s discus toss of
119-7, Pembroke’s 800-meter

Tennis Squad Endures

Disappointing Weekend

by David Stuart

Losses- to George Mason
University and Virginia Com-
monwealth University by iden-
tical scores of 6-3 turned the
Washington and Lee tennis
team’s four-game homestand
into frustration and disappoint-
ment last weekend.

Friday, the team was tied 3-3
with VCU after six very close
singles matches. The doubles
were a different story, however,
as all three of the Generals’
pairs lost. The number three
duo of Andy Haring and Stephen
Bendheim lost 7-6, 6-4 and Craig
Cannon and, Charlie Kalocsay,
the number one team, split sets
before losing 6-1,4-6,1-6.

In contrast, W&L took all
three doubles matches handily
against George Mason but drop-
ped all six singles matches.
Cannon, Kalocsay and Bend-
heim split sets and Jim Irwin
and Andy Haring lost tie-
breakers. Wes Yonge mounted
a desperate comeback but fell
short, 0-6,5-7.

Coach Gary Franke said that
he was “disappointed” with the
6-3 losses and thought his
players could play better. He
admits the schedule is challeng-

ing but adds, ‘‘We haven’t risen
to the occasion.”’

Franke says the team needs
to ‘develop concentration” on
the court. Many of the players
complained that upcoming ex-
am pressures on top of a heavy
match schedule (six matches in
seven days) is tiring. ‘‘I have
too much on my mind,”’ said
Kalocsay after one match and
Haring admitted feeling
“pressure”’ from exams.

The week was not a total loss
for W&L, however, as_ they
destroyed Emory and Henry 8-1
last week and Shepherd College
9-0 on Tuesday. In other match-
es, the Harvard junior varsity
squad and James Madison
University overpowered, the
Generals 9-0.

After heading south for five
matches over spring break, the
team’s next home match will be
on Sunday, Apr. 25, against
William and Mary.

Two’of Schuler’s goals came

Shaffer Speaks On Christian Lawyers

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity law professor Thomas L.
Shaffer told an audience at the
Legal Ethics Institute last week
that the “moral command or
example for us professionals is
that we take on the servant’s
task...”’

Shaffer, the author of a book
entitled ‘“‘On Being a Christian
and a Lawyer,” addressed a
group of both practicing
lawyers and Washington and
Lee undergraduates who were
participating in the three-day
Legal Ethics Institute. The in-

cereus cmt muaaiiaaesasiamsuician ines uieaaitasiasiiiutiisamsnsiiatitaaiimmainiimaanitaiaamaiaiammmmamimaimaitiion
nS A SE CAS ETC A TESST NEE TS,

 

The Richmond Ballet!

stitute is part of W&L’s in-
novative program in applied
ethics, “Society and the Profes-
sions.”

Using the Biblical image of
the ‘“‘suffering servant,’’ Shaf-
fer said that lawyers ‘‘are not
merely to serve (their clients) ;
we are to be their servants, and
to expect to suffer for it. This is
a clear and radical command.”

Added Shaffer: ‘The aim of
our, moral life with our
clients...is that we serve in such
a way that the person served

 

 

will himself become a servant
— that he will himself be moved
to love, to good works, to the
company of those who serve.”’

By accepting the servant’s
task, said Shaffer, lawyers
serve God “‘by being servants to
our clients, by being servants in
suffering, in powerlessness, and
in reconciliation. That. is the
legal ethics of servanthood, the
way to be a Christian and a'
lawyer.”

As servant to his client, a
lawyer hopes that his client will
be free and that in his freedom
the client ‘‘will see clearly and
choose bravely and end up do-
ing the right thing,” said Shaf-
fer.

The lawyer-servant also
hopes that his client ‘will grow
in virtue, will not only make
right choices but will become
the sort of person who makes
right choices. I want him to be
better than he would have been
if I had not stumbled into his
life.”’

Shaffer joined the W&L law
faculty in 1980 after previously
serving as dean of the Universi-
ty of Notre Dame’s law school.
He has published numerous ar-
ticles and has lectured widely in
the area of legal ethics.

The S.A.B. Is Alive And Kicking For Spring Term

by Gil Kingman

For the past few weeks,
rumours have spread that the
Spring term, with its partying
potential, will come and go un-
noticed. After Monday night’s
decision by the Executive Com-
mittee, it appears that the Stu-
dent Activities Board will in-
deed provide the community
with music.

Is ‘“‘Tuesday’s” dead? Ap-
parently not. The S.A.B. will
continue to bring quality enter-
tainment to the campus. Spring
term entertainment will start
on the Tuesday after break with
a performance by Skip Castro
in the Cockpit. But the April 20
performance by Skip is not the

only one planned. Nther bands,

including Telluride and the
Good Humor Band, will be in-
cluded on the schedule.

But what about beyond
“‘Tuesday’s?”’ To kickoff the
festivities for the lacrosse game
with the North Carolina
Tarheels, the Nighthawks will
perform on Friday night, April
23; at the Pavillion. More
weekend entertainment at the
Cockpit, including the Deal, is
also planned.

Also included in the S.A.B.’s
plans is a Spring Weekend,
which will tentatively be held
May 8. The perormance, by a
topflight band that has yet to be

named, will be sponsored by |
both the S.A.B. and the junior |

class.

You Can Take Only A Two-Hour Ride To Monterey

(Author’s Note: This article was
written for last week’s paper, but
the editors, in their infinite
wisdom, found no room for it. So,
you can go to Monterey if you
like, but the festival was over last

waenene? by John Wells —

If you have nothing to do this
weekend, I might suggest scal-
ing a few mountains to attend
the Highland County Maple
Festival.

Being a Virginian, I frequent-
ly extoll the diverse and
unusual features of the state.
The Maple Festival is quite uni-
que to the region, in fact the
southern-most event of its kind.

Beautiful Highland County is
mountainous to the ~point of
almost resembling Vermont or
New Hampshire. Maple trees
there have been bursting with
sugar water each spring for
centuries, and the county
depends on the festival: to help

boost an otherwise anemic
economy.

Unfortunately for visitors in-
terested in the sugar process,
the trees all sapped out early
this year. But this doesn’t at all
detract from enjoyment deriv-
ed from the essential purpose of
the day, which is to stuff oneself
like a pig.

Arrive in Monterey, about
two hours from Lexington. The
county seat is a picturesque
village of neatly-kept clapboard
homes surrounded by picket
fences. Ordinarily, the place to
eat here is the Maple Res-
taurant, a landmark identified
by the large, glaring pink and
aqua neon flashing fish perched
on its roof. During the festival,
however, food is also served at
the local schools and in smaller,
surrounding communities.

Highland Elementary, for in-
stance, serves from 9 a.m. to 6

Rasasco is a 1951 graduate of
W&L with a B.S. degree in com-
merce. He is president of and
operates six corporations that
specialize in real estate and
land development and are head-
quartered in Milton, Fla.

Extremely active in civic af-
fairs, Rosasco is president of
the Democratic County Chair-

p.m., and for less than four
dollars you get sausage or ham,
coffee and all the buckwheat or
regular pancakes with butter
and that dreamy pure maple
syrup you can eat. The
buckwheat cakes, with their
distinct flavor and texture, are
infinitely preferable.

Then it’s over another moun-
tain to Blue Grass (formerly
Crab Bottom) for more spec-
tacular scenery and a close look
at one of the maple orchards.

The closest orchard is Rex-
rode’s, where ancient, gnarled
maples are plugged and drain-
ed using modern plastic tubing.
They still boil down the sugar
water in long shallow vats;
about 60 gallons of the water
produces one gallon of the
syrup, which is amber-colored,
not extremely thick and quite
sweet.

The Virginia Program at Ox-
ford, which is supported by
Washington and Lee and five
other colleges in the state, is ex-
periencing some difficulty here.

Dean Pamela Simpson says
the school is currently losing
money on the program, with 16
participants signed up and four
more needed to break even.

In 1981 he served as Good Will

Aalborn. Rosasco is author of
“Musings, In God We Trust,”
published in 1981 by the Univer-
sity of West Florida Alumni
Association.

Monterey, it’s a good idea to
burn off breakfast by walking
around the steep hills and
woods. The terrain is either
straight uphill or down and af-
fords a beautiful view of the
tall, sprawling Alleghenies.

To really do the weekend up
right, many visitors stay over-
night in the recently restored
Highland Inn in Monterey. The
turn-of-the-century hotel faces
Main Street with a double-
decked porch which runs the
length of the building. Over-
nighters can really get into the
whole scene by attending even-
ing events like the Maple
Queen’s Ball, the Sugar Shake-
up, the Buckwheat Stomp or the
Festival Fling.

— Rasasco Oxford Deadline

In order to encourage more
students to sign up by extending
the deadline for application to
May 1. So far, three W&L
students have applied for the
program as well as seven from
Sweet Briar, one from
Hampden-Sydney, and five
from Mary Baldwin. The other
schools participating in the pro-
gram are V.M.I. and Roanoke
College.

The Oxford program is a very
worthwhile one, as any W&L
participant in it will tell you.
Those interested in more infor-
mation about the program
should make a beeline for Dean
Simpson’s office and remember

. the May 1 deadline.

the courthouse; craft and anti-
que shows; blacksmith demon-
strations; and — you guessed it
— more food! Country ham
served on hot rolls, maple
doughnuts fresh-made by the
Mill Gap Ruritan Club (takes
about 45 minutes standing in
line to get a box), pretzels and
cheeses made by Mennonite
farmers and maple candy
shaped like leaves in various
sizes.

While most of the food isn’t
outrageously expensive, neither
is it cheap. The ham rolls are
$1.30, for instance, and the
maple leaves are 30 or 60 cents
depending on the size. Bags
with a half-dozen little shell-
shaped candies go for $1 each.

It doesn’t take long to gb up to,
Monterey, but don’t forget to

preserved piece of Americana

(continued from page 7)
which sells food, hardware and
clothing in narrow aisles with
tall shelves and lots of at-
mosphere.

In case you were wondering,
it’s time for dinner now. Varia-
tions are served in the schools,
but the chowdown I can vouch
for is in tiny McDowell, about
five miles east of Monterey.
There, the McDowell Volunteer
Fire Department Firehouse has
long folding tables set up for the
day-long feed.

There, for $4.50, one may
choose from trout, barbequed
chicken or ham (the fresh
mountain trout is by far the
best) and green beans, baked
potato, coleslaw, all the
homemade bread and apple-
sauce you can eat, coffee or tea
and a slice of cake toiled over
by a fire dept wife.

From there, contented
festival-goers may waddle back
to their respective wheels and

 

 

head back to Lex. (it should be
about 6 p.m. by now) or
wherever.

Fifteen dollars plus a tank of
gas and a cooler of beer can get
you through the day. and the
more the merrier. It’s
pleasurable and slow-paced, a
day to enjoy the most basic of
activities, but it isn’t cool to
drink in public.

Directions: a number of op-
tions — take I-81 to Staunton
and from there U.S. 250 all the
way to Monterey. Or take U.S.
39 through Goshen to Warm
Springs, and Rt. 220 from there
to Monterey. Any route will
take approximately two hours
to travel. Those who like rambl-
ing drives through isolated
stretches might want to take 39
through Goshen to Va. 678,
which turns right, in front of an
old brick church. This goes
through a valley of old farms on
a decent road on which other
vehicles are rarely seen.

Law Forum Hosts Schewel

The Tucker Law Forum will
host a visit from Stanford
Schewel, a New York entertain-
ment lawyer, on April 5 and 6.

Schewel, a 1940 W&L Law
School graduate, served with
the OSS in Egypt, Ethiopia and
Palestine from 1942 to 1945. He

was also vice counsel and
economic analyst in the United

States diplomatic service, serv-

ing as financial attache to the
U.S. Consulate General in
Amsterdam from 1945 to 1946.

Schewel has also been an
assistant to John W. Davis.
Davis was, according to
Schewel, one of America’s
great lawyers and one of the
most famous W&L Law School
graduates.

On April 5 at 8:00 p.m. in
Classroom C of the Law School,
Schewel will lecture on ‘The
Development of Federalism in
the United States.” This lecture.

is a summary and update of a
monograph he wrote while
assisting Davis, then a member
of the Hoover Commission (The
Commission on the Organiza-
tion of the Executive Branch of
Government).

The monograph, which focus-
ed on the development of state
and national powers in the
United States and conflicts be-
tween them, was subsequently
published by the Commission on
Intergovernmental Relations.
Schewel’s monograph on
governmental powers was
highly acclaimed. It was
designated -‘‘must reading” for
the Council of State Govern-
ments, and was highly praised
by Milton S. Eisenhower and
Herbert Hoover.

“In our current political
climate, there is no more timely
topic. The question of what is
our new federalism or our old

federalism, and where it is all
leading, is the subject of lively
discussion in today’s politics,
and I feel it would be an ap-
propriate topic for discussion
among legal scholars.”

On April 6 at 11:00 a.m. in the
Moot Court Room, Schewel will
briefly discuss and answer
questions concerning his enter-
tainment law practice. Enter-
tainment law entails mostly
contract and tax work and his
discussion will focus on tax
strategies for entertainment
personalities.

Schewel has practiced enter-
tainment law in New York for
twenty years. Some of the per-
sonalities he has represented in-
clude: Lauren Bacall, Lee
Remick, Gloria Swanson,
Eileen Brennan, Dick Gregory,
the Smothers ‘Brothers, Abe
Vigoda, Charles Nelson Reilly,
George Segal, Bob and Ray,
Totie Fields, and many others.

 

Generally Speaking -

(continued from page 4)
Track and Field

One word to describe the
Washington and Lee track and
field squad would be ‘‘young.”’
Another would be “potential.”

Most collegiate teams are led
by juniors and seniors, but that
is not the case for the W&L
squad, although upperclassmen
do make sizeable contributions.
However, the top stars for the
Generals after three meets ap-
pear to be freshmen Chris
Busbee, Chris Ives, Scott
Henderson, and Mark Pem-
broke and sophomores Angus
McBryde, Charlie Alcorn and
Kevin Kadesky.

Senior Greg Branan and
junior Alan Armitage are also
giving consistent performances
in their events, the 5000-meter

  

 

run and the 1l0-meter hurdles,
respectively.

This squad, with a little more
depth in the field events, could
truly be awesome in two years,
and‘ they’re not too bad right
now with a 4-0 record.

Baseball

Washington and Lee has
never been particularly noted
for its baseball teams, but this
year may be an exception. Com-
ing off their first ODAC tourna-
ment appearance, coach Jim
Murdock’s Generals bolted to a
4-2 start before becoming mired

_ in a slump that had dropped

their record to 46 prior to
yesterday’s matchup with Col-
gate.

The Generals do play a con-
siderable number of Division I
teams, however, and they have

the potential to snap this latest
slump. The pitching staff, led
by Dave Randall and Rich
Hachenberg, appears to be
strong but not very deep.
Freshman Billy White is 0-1 with
one save after two starts, but
the one no-decision was a 3-2
extra-inning loss to California
State in which he only allowed
two hits over nine innings.

At the plate, Thad Ellis, Chris
Cavalline and Dave Warren-
feltz are among the top six RBI-
men in the ODAC, and co-
captain Jeff Haggerty is com-
ing around slowly but surely
after an injury early this
season.

One of the squad’s goals this
year had to be to qualify for the
league tournament, and they
should be able to do that.

Veggie Look-alike Winners

 

CABBAGE MAN — Gus Barlow of Glasgow proudly displays the
seven pound head that won his first place in the cabbage competi-
tion. Gus and his wife, Dottie Sue, grew the tumescent wonder in
their annual garden, and neither of them noticed it for months, hid-
den as it was by the plastic tub the Bariows use everry fall to clean
hog guts. Gus is looking forward to the mounds of cooked cabbage
from this single vegetable, although Dottie Sue was less en-
thusiastic at the prospect.

 

GREATAH TOMATAH — This three-pound beauty was grown by
Emma Lu Fishbreath in the garden she raises annually outside

Buena Vista. ,

When this publication an-
nounced last year that it would
hold a vegetable look-alike con-
test, it was not expected that so
many people would enter. But
they did, and as you can see
from the pictures on this page
the results were amazing.

Most of the vegetables were
brought in late last August and
publication of the pictures has
been witheld until now. The win-
ners received no prizes other
than the pleasure of having
their pictures and vegetables
printed on this page.

The paper would like tothank
everyone who entered the con-
tests and regrets that not
everyone could get their pic-
tures in the paper.

We would like announce a
new contests for ou our next
issue and invite any and all to
participate.

 

 

TURNIP TWINS — Grady Rae Squalow of Natural Bridge holds the
titan turnips he grew in his back yard, double-winners int he turnip
contest. ‘‘I don’t know how they come to get so big,” professed the

retired clerk of the Natural Bridge Gift Shop.

 

MACHO MELONS — Xavier Shifflett of Route 2,
Lexington, admires this enormous pair of
canteloupes he grew in his abundant garden.
Xavier came in second place in the canteloupe
category. The Shiffletts plan to hollow out the
melons to make jack-o-lanterns for Halloween,
since, as Xavier pointed out ‘“‘We don’t grow no

big trouble with his wife, Myrtle, whose burpless

IF THAT DON’T BEET ALL
—Otto T. Grunt, of Fairfield
~ hoists this unusual beet he says
he grew in a cow pasture near

his farm. Mr. Grunt, who
claims to be a distant relative of
the late Jimmy Durante, would
not specify the particular por-
tion of his anatomy the beet
most resembles but, there being
a shortage of beet competitors
this year, the Phi took him at
his word.

WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? — Beulah V. Suddrath didn’t win
anything, but we couldn’t resist running this attractive and highly
unusual photo of her. She was on the way to her doctor to have
surgically removed these copulating Chinese cabbages which sud-
denly and inexplicably sprouted from the right nostril of her nose.
Beulah said: she didn’t notice them at first, but then they began
making unusual noises and moving and, she said, ‘‘I got sick and
tired of carrying the durn things to the beauty parlor and my circle
meetings.
