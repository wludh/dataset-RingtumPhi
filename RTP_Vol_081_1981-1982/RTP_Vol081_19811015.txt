EC Nukes Spiritual Group;
IVCF Controversy Continues

by Todd Smith
and Jeff Gwynn

The Executive Committee
denied funds to a student group
that would allocate money to
religious and spiritual groups
on campus and provide semi-
nars on philosphical questions.

The Coalition for Spiritual
and Philosophic Inquiry was
formed after the E.C. rejected
the budget proposal of the Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship,
and recommended that they
return with a new name.

Bill Archer and Jon Pakula,
who led the fight against E.C.
support of IVCF, joined with
Frank Williams and Gary
Carneal, of the Christian group,
to speak for the Coalition.

Ted McQuistion, ’84 rep., said
that last week’s denial of funds
to IVCF was due to the commit-
tee’s reluctance to fund a
religious organization with stu-
dent body funds.

“We appropriate in lump
sum, they appropriate it down
through the ranks,’’ McQuiston
offered as the way the Coali-
tion’s funding would work,”’...I
can’t distinguish the difference

(between that and outright
funding of the IVCF).”

Secretary Bennett Ross said
that the motion passed last
week did not rule out support
for religious organizations.

“It was inherent in the motion
that we wouldn’t fund an organ-
ization with a religiously ex-
clusive name, such as IVCF,
but the motion said please come
back for a funding request with
a different organization, which
they have,”’ said Ross.

Morgan Griffith, Law rep.,
noted that the Coalition’s
framework did not include a
rigid constituion specifying how
many students would constitute
a group eligible for Coalition
funds, and therefore he could
not support it.

Ben Hale, ’84 rep., stated that
student body funds should go to
no organization that proposed to
propogate its faith among
students.

John Viahoplus moved that
the E.C. recommend some ac-
tion by the president of the
university. A letter will be sent
to Robert Huntley, president,

“in regard to the need to
establish and fund an alter-
native life-style with specific
reference to spiritual develop-
ment through a coalition.”’

In other action, the E.C.
heard from the chairman and
treasurer of the Mock Conven-
tion, Chairman Bud White an-
nounced that the Sumners
Foundation of Texas had pro-
vided Washington and Lee
University with a $100,000 en-
dowment for use by the Mock
Convention.

Interest of 5.5 percent on the
endowment will provide $20,000
or more to the convention every
four years.

Hale reported that he was
conferring with President
Huntley and Dean Lewis G.
John about placing student
body reserves in a money
market account.

President Eric Myers read
this statement into the minutes:
the Honor System applies fully
in the University Library Sys-
tem; all materials used are to
be checked out through the
main desk.

a half-drunk cup of coffee. In front and to her left sit stacks of files
and folders, all patiently awaiting her attention. She wears a con-

cardigan, no make-up, and her hair is fastened simply in the back.
She is Pamela Hemenway Simpson, the new Assistant Dean of
Washington & Lee University, and though she may sound ordinary
by description, she’s anything but.

Anti-nuke and pro choice_regarding abortion, she is the ‘first

regular appointment to the university’s faculty and is now the first
woman to ever receive a deanship (unless one counts the time dur-
ing WWII when the school opened co-educationally during the sum-
mer and appointed a Dean of Women. But that was for financial
reasons, So, no, don’t count that).

“But I’m also the first art historian ever to receive this position,”
she notes, pointing to the fact that sexual genre hardly serves as
criteria for determining job qualification. ‘The administration’s

ecutive producer of the weekly

Washington & Lee University
on Thursday, Oct. 22, at 8 p.m.
in Lee Chapel.

Brown’s appearance at Wash-

Student Association for Black

Journal” is the longest-running,
nationally syndicated black af-
fairs program on television.
Brown joined “Black Journal,”’

and took the program to com-

Formerly host and moderator

qualified — although I don’t think you can divorce the fact.”

Dean Simpson cites her qualifications for her job as ‘‘serving on
the Executive Council and University Council, working with
publicity, and getting along well with the students.’’ Perhaps the
latter is what most students here know her so well for. And perhaps
that’s because she was a student too, once.

“I was what we considered a ‘freak’ in college and what the
media labeled ‘hippie.’ A freak was anyone that was different in
1968,’’ she remembers. A student at Gettysburg College, Dr. Simp-
son participated actively in anti-war protests and the singing of
peace songs.

‘Viet Nam was an incredibly absurd, obscene war,”’ she says. ‘‘I
remember picketing the Dow Corporation — they’re the ones that
made napalm. One sign I carried read ‘Draft Beer, Not Boys.’ ”

There’s ‘Justice’ After All

by Todd Jones

Ruth Loomis has just been ap-
pointed as the first woman
Supreme Court Justice. Al-
though her appointment to the
court brings great joy to most of
the women in America, Justice
Dan Snow is not that excited. He
tells the C.J. (Chief Justice),
“Watch it — there are only
eight of us left against all of
her.’’ First Monday in October
is a movie which should delight
most viewers, not only because
of fine acting, but also due to a
well-written, very funny, script.

First Monday stars Walter
Matthau as Dan Snow, a Justice
on the Supreme Court for many
years. He is a liberal, and is
known as “The Great Dis-
senter.”” He loves to climb
mountains, and also to defend
the First Amendment. He is
quite obviously fashioned after
the late justice William
Douglas, even down to suffering
a stroke in his 23rd year on the
bench.

The latest appointment to the
Court, Ruth Loomis, is played
by Jill Clayburgh. She comes
from Orange County, Califor-
nia, and is a staunch conser-
vative. Needless to say, she and
Matthau spend most of the film
bickering over different issues
before the court. In their first
dispute, Justice Loomis would
like to ban a pornographic film
which she feels is offensive.
Justice Snow believes that the

film should be allowed to be
shown under the provisions
allowed in the First Amend-
ment. Snow argues, ‘‘What is it
about the film that makes it so
offensive? Is it the title — ‘The
Naked Nymphomaniac?’
Maybe it is the other word that
bothers you — Nym-pho-
maniac. What if it were called
‘The Naked Methodist?’”’

There are some interesting
moments in the film. I have just
finished reading The Brethren,
by Woodward and Armstrong,
and I found that some of the in-
cidents in the book were also
found in this movie. One inci-
dent in particular involved
Charles Lampkin, who played
the role fashioned after
Thurgood Marshall. In the mid-
dle of a screening for a por-
nographic film, the announcer
comments that this nympho-
maniac can never be cured of
her increasing desire for
physical pleasure. Marshall (or
Lampkin) comments, ‘‘Well, I
don’t know about her, but I sure
am.”

The film is full of insults and
jibes of one sort or another.
Matthau has most of them, and
delivers them excellently. His
performance is of the calibre
that is expected of a fine com-
edic actor. He displays his
talents impressively. Clay-
burgh is also given several good
lines. At one point in the film,
Matthau tells Clayburgh that
she doesn’t have the money to
pay for a cab. Clayburgh
retorts, ‘‘You liberals never
do!’’ Whether you are liberal or
conservative, there are enough
good lines floating about the
film to make any serious party
ally chuckle at the opposition as
well as at himself.

The only shortcoming of First
Monday is that it was rushed to
be distributed when O’Connor
was announced as the latest
Supreme Court Justice.
Because of this, not enough
time seemed to be given to the
ending of the film, which I
thought was a little weak.

Regardless of the ending,
First Monday is a tremendously
enjoyable film. The movie

abounds with excellent
dialogue, most of which centers
around Matthau’ and

Clayburgh. Matthau, as the

free of charge. There will be an
open reception in the Lewis Hall
lobby after each night’s screen-
ing.

Blier’s cinema constructs a
world of male fantasies and
males’ images of women which
real women inhabit with a
mysterious and disruptive
force. In Get Out Your Hand-
kerchiefs, Blier explores the
marriage of a man who thinks

that because his wife chews her’

food without gusto, she must be
bored with him. Loving his wife,
and wanting to preserve the
marriage, the husband brings a
friend into the relationship, but
his wife, tired perhaps of being
told what she must be feeling,
meanwhile falls in love with a
thirteen-year old boy who
makes no claim to know what
she is wanting or feeling. He
asks to be taught.

Elaborating with wry affec-
tion on the various combina-
tions of love and friendship
possible among these four
characters, the movie pays

Diamonds Are Forever (1971) Sean Connery in his last ap-

Typically splashy, flashy sexy spy stuff, a must for anyone who
considered Connery the one and only Bond. Shown by the SAB this
weekend in duPont. Admission is $1.

The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Germany, 1919) ‘Classic horror
film, valued not only for its impressionistic sets and clever story,
but for its unmistakable influence on German film-making of the
twenties. Werner Krauss and Conrad Veidt starred, Robert Weine
directed...Allowing for certain primitive aspects, it still has power
to thrill.’” — from Halliwell’s Filmgoer’s Companion. Shown by the

THE ROAD:

Hollins: The Home Of
Green & Gold Collies

Last of a Series
Hollins College
Hollins, Va.

We started this series winding
up Rte. 60 to Sweet Briar and
last week we rambled north on
Interstate. 81 to Mary Baldwin.
Therefore, it seems only logical
to end our guide by travelling
south on Rte. 81 to Hollins Col-
lege, that citadel of southern

- womanhood located only a few
' miles outside of Roanoke.

The term ‘‘Hollins’’ invokes
raised eyebrows from most
under and upperminks at W&L.
Hollins girls carry the reputa-
tion of the best looking of all
local females. Hollins also
seems to draw the girls with the
biggest bucks. Looks and
money, not a bad combination.

But before going down to
Hollins, underminks are ad-
vised to if any way possible get
their favorite collie to visit Lex-
ington. In terms of partying,
Hollins ranks in the fair-to-poor
category.

But if you are intent on
travelling down to Hollins, here
are a few observations.

The road to Hollins is the
equal in boredom to the Mary
Baldwin journey, only this time
you're going south rather than
north. Once you get to Hollins,
you'll notice a campus much
resembling a small Baptist
school. Among the dorms and
buildings of academia, one will

But in laying out the campus,
Hollins’ foremothers forgot to

 

times.

include adequate party space.

To its credit, Hollins does
have a beer joint named the
Rathskeller. Unfortunately, it’s
about the only location that can
handle large groups.

Dancing is never possible, as
the local dancing facilities ac-
commodate one or two dozen
shaggers tops. And if you ever
thirst for a beer, forget it.
Hollins girls operate under the
misguided judgment that you
should tap only one keg at a
time. Beer lines are numbered
according to hours, days and
weeks.

One ritual you would be better
off missing is the annual Tinker
Day celebration, which was
held several weeks ago. Hollins
girls rush up to the top of Tinker
Mountain then spend the day
having a picnic. The event is
conveniently held on a day
when classes can be cancelled
It’s a tough life.

But for all its problems,
Hollins is still an inviting
package for road-faring minks.
The best trapping occurs in the
middle of the week, when most
females can be caught in their
rooms.

Most minks don’t seem tc
mind the shortcomings, either.
They keep coming back in
flocks, be it a Saturday night
dance or a Sunday afternoor
party.

So when you have a few hours
to kill, visit the green-and-gold
at Hollins. You'll probably re.

Generals Upset Scots

by Dale Park

Before a Homecoming crowd
of 3,137 at Wilson Field last
Saturday, the Washington &
Lee varsity football team hung
on to a 14-0 halftime advantage
and squeaked past ODAC rival
Maryville College, 14-12.

The Scots topped the
Generals in almost every major
Statistical category, yet
Maryville, the league’s leading
team in both passing and
rushing, was unable to score in
the first half.

Head coach Gary Fallon com-
mented that his W&L defense
had “come to life’ after a poor
showing in last week’s loss to
Randolph-Macon College. Said
Fallon, ‘We played an ag-
gressive type of team defense in
which we swarmed to the ball.
We weren’t just grabbing at
people this time.’’

While the defense sealed off
Maryville’s offense, the W&L
offense got on track, scoring all
14 points in the first half.

Generals Survived A Tough Test

by John Cleghorn

Saturday’s game was a big
one for the 1981 Generals. They
went into the game with an even
.500 mark and a chance to fall
into a losing schedule or to sus-
tain their winning efforts. The
decision was bigger than a
midseason record might in-
dicate. The mark of 3-2 ties the
record for the best start for
W&L football in 14 years. A
record of 2-3 might only resem-
ble the unpleasant, mediocre
past.

The Generals stood up to the
test though, and it was by no
means a simple one. Maryville
brought the ODAC’s _ stongest
passing attack to a secondary
that had gotten taken for a com-
pletion of 60 yards or more in
each of its four games. The
results could have been

disastrous. Instead, Gary
Fallon implemented a five man
secondary that effectively
stopped the pass outake. It was
certainly a team effort as each
time the Maryville QB faded to
pass the entire bench became a
defender in yells ‘Pass!’ and
appropriately ‘‘short” or
“Jong.’”’ They didn’t sound much
like a boys choir but it obviously
worked. The pass rush was also
effective in forcing the QB to
scramble.

Midway through the season
last year Larry Munson, the
University of Georgia football
announcer, upon noticing their
undefeated record prophetical-
ly asked ‘‘Have you looked at
the rest of the schedule?”’ So
now, have you? The win Satur-
day was vital to the Generals’
ODAC quest. They have only

two ODAC losses, an attribute
only three teams can boast. But
that does not mean we are there
yet. In the second half of the
season there remain three
ODAC teams. The Generals
must continue to perform as
they did Saturday.

It was a sweet homecoming
indeed, though mostly for the
football players. It still remains
quite a paradox that for a
weekend intended to highlight
the football team, the game is
the least attended event of the
weekend.

quarter, capped off by a one-
yard touchdown plunge by
junior tailback Chris Cavalline.
Paradise himself scrambled for
a score from twelve yards out
late in the second quarter as
W&L built a 14-0 halftime lead.

Although W&L did not score
in the second half, Fallon main-
tained that his team was not
playing it safe. ‘“‘We knew that
fourteen points may not be
enough, yet we sometimes lack
the killer instinct as a team and,
as a result, the game was
close,” said the coach.

The Scots’ explosive offense
didn’t get rolling until the final
five minutes of the third
quarter, when Maryville mar-
ched 95 yards in ten plays and
finally scored on a 42-yard
touchdown pass. The conver-
sion failed, however, and in-
stead of trailing by only seven
points, Maryville trailed by
eight, 14-6.

The Scots mounted another
long scoring drive late in the
fourth quarter. Taking over on
their own 20-yard line, Mary-
ville took five minutes and 17

plays before pushing the ball in-
to the endzone on a one-yard
scoring run. Maryville failed to
convert on its two-point at-
tempt, and two missed conver-
sions proved to be the margin of
W&L’s 14-12 win.

The victory was the first for
the Generals in five contests
against Maryville. The win left
W&L with a 3-2 overall record
and a 2-1 mark in the ODAC.
For Maryville, it was the first
loss of the season. The Scots’
overall record slipped to 4-1
while their ODAC mark fell to
3-1 — still Slightly ahead of the
Generals in league play.

Next Saturday the Generals
will try to improve their ODAC
record as they travel to Hamp-
den Sydney to take on the
Tigers. Last season W&L
claimed a 17-13 victory over H-
SC, but Fallon warns that ‘‘we
can’t be fooled by the H-SC’s 1-4
record so far. They have an ex-
plosive offense and will be sky-
high for us. It’s their Homecom-
ing, and this game could make
their whole season for them.”’

Tied for the lead with a 50
record after the first half of the
Southern League water polo
tournament, Washington & Lee
(16-2) will compete at the
Bucknell Tournament this
weekend.

Three of the top four teams on
the east coast will be there, ac-
cording to Coach Page Remil-
lard. They are Brown, Slippery
Rock (remember them?), and
Bucknell. The Generals will
open-against Cornell on Friday
before facing Slippery Rock and
Brown on Saturday. Should they
then have complied one of the
top two records in that division,
they will move on to the finals
with two teams from the other
division, which includes
Bucknell and Richmond.

The Generals undefeated
record last weekend was the

same as that of Richmond. The
two teams will meet next week-
end during the final half of the
league tourney. The top four
finishers from the tourney ad-
vance to the league champion-
ships Nov. 7-8 at W&L.

Duke gave W&L its stiffest
test of the weekend as the
Generals came away with a 12-8
win. ‘We didn’t get a lot of
breaks in the game (W&L had
two goals called back by
penalties), and there were a lot
of whistles,” said Remillard.
‘“‘Under adversity, we played
extremely well. We were too
tense before the game and
made some mistakes. We’re
just glad we got it out of the
way.”

Booters Take
First Shutout

The Washington & Lee soccer
team dropped a 1-0 decision to
Division II member Radford
last Saturday. The Generals’
first shutout of the year left
them with a 3-4 mark, the first
time they have fallen below
-500.

Head coach Rolf - Piranian
described the match as “‘very
competitive. The score doesn’t
indicate the effort both teams
gave. The outcome could easily

have been the other way
around.”

In addition, Remillard was
“totally impressed’’ with his
top four substitutes, who saw
lots of action. Sophomores Matt
Ravencraft and Keith Kadesky
scored ten goals apiece and
freshman Bobby Pearson added
six.

The team now has its sights

Harriers Place Second
In Lynchburg Tri-Meet

by Rick Swagler
The Washington & Lee cross-
country team placed second in a
tri-meet held this past Saturday
in Lynchburg. Lynchburg Col-
lege placed first with 30 points,

W&L was second with 43 points.

and Norfolk State University
was third with 56 points.

For the Generals, Angus
McBryde finished fourth over-
all and first for W&L with a
time of 27:40 over the five-mile
course. Frank Pittman was
eight seconds behind McBryde
and finished fifth overall. Jon
Kelefant was back in good form
with a seventh place finish and
a 28:06 clocking. Paul Chapman
finished eleventh overall in
28:43 and Steve Whetzle round-
ed out the Generals’ top five
with a 16th place finish and a
time of 29:31.

McBryde commented that the
main reason for the defeat was
that he and Pittman ‘“‘lost con-
tact with the leaders and had to
play catch up.’’ McBryde added
that the course was ‘‘a perfect
mixture of pavement, trails and
fields, but it was confusing.”
The fact that the course was

confusing was also noted by
Assistant Coach Paul Thomson.

Thomson added that not only
was the course confusing, but
“the crowd yelled obscenities
and called us ‘preppies’ which
momentarily broke some of our
guys’ concentration.”’ Thomson
was especially pleased with the
performance of Tony Ierardi, a
senior running first year of
cross-country. Ierardi finished
sixth for the Generals and 17th
overall, turning in a time of
29:49.

Coach Dick Miller’s only com-
ment on the race was, ‘‘They
ran faster than we did.’’ He did
comment on Kelefant’s perfor-
mance, saying that the junior
was back where he should be.

Captain Greg Branan, re-
covering from tendonitis, said

that he was proud of the team.
Branan commented that ‘the

two-edged sword. They have a

There was speculation that

in the season but the situation
did not materialize.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

CONSTITUTIONAL
AMENDMENTS

The Case For...

Once again, it is time to settle the question of the
Executive Committee and constitutional amend-
ments. Last year’s efforts, if you remember, ended in
nothing less than total chaos, as the proposals failed
due to a lack of student participation. Again the EC is
proposing changes and again the changes are subject
to the whims of the student body.

At first glance, the amendments should go through
untouched. Most of the changes are cosmetic — they
serve only to clear up vague and otherwise hazy
language. At least this is the case for five of the seven
amendments. The other two amendments, as we shall
see, have a direct bearing on what you will read in the
future.

 

If you like an EC that not only can make the paper
but run it, then you should get out and vote.

The Case Against...

Hopefully, students will not be buffaloed into believ-
ing that every amendment is meaningless. Amend-
ment Seven, tucked away neatly at the end of the pro-
posals, expands the EC’s power from ‘‘appellate
jurisdiction” to that of ‘“‘powers of review.’’ We feel
that the EC’s intervention is uneccessary in that the
EC has as much a right to direct the school’s publica-
tions as the school’s publications have a right to
operate the EC. If the EC is so desperate to control
matters brought up by student publications, then
perhaps the publications should spend more time wat-
ching the EC.

One legitimate question is raised. If the school’s
publications serve as a watchdog of student govern-
ment, then what happens when the EC places a
stonger leash on the watchdog? The answer, of
course, is that all facets of government and publica-
tions become weaker.

Editors of student publications have traditionally
been elected by the Publication Board, which is com-
prised of past and present editors. The EC, which
may claim an editor or two from high school and
perhaps a college editor now attending the law school,
wants to have the final say. Yes, the professionals will
be replaced by the amateurs.

Perhaps the EC and student publications could
develop an exchange program. In exchange for con-
trol of publications, the EC could cede all honor mat-
ters and budget hearings to the Publications Board.
The Board likely knows as much about the ad-
ministration of the honor sysytem as the EC does
about running a newspaper, a yearbook or a literary
magazine.

The EC gives funds for student publications. Now it
wants more influence in the publications themselves.
Next thing you know, Eric Myers and Co. will be per-
sonally hand-cranking the presses.

If we are all to be viewed as reasonably intelligent
adults, then why is all this need for review necessary?

 

 

 

 

 

Can The IVCF Be Called LealEiehatet

Dear Sir:

On Oct. 6, the E.C. denied
funds to the Ly.C.F. (Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship)
on the grounds that it was not
“proper”? for the student
government to ‘‘legitimize” a
religious group by granting
them funds. Since the E.C. cur-
rently views itself as an
organization founded upon the
heritage of the United States
Constitution, it was felt that
they had no right to support any
group with a particular relig-
ious affiliation. If their original
premise is accepted, their deci-
sion was correct. However, I
would like to present a different
interpretation of the argument.

I feel that the E.C. is a group
which has been chosen by the
student body to represent its in-
terests in the everyday activ-
ities of student government. As
I understand it, each student
pays $55 to the school for a
general fund which is used to
fund a variety of student
organizations. These organiza-
tions are required to submit a
request for funds and a budget
of sorts to the E.C. which
evaluates the merits of each
group and allots funds as it sees
fit. If the 1.V.C.F. is viewed
simply as a group of students
which has meetings, speakers
and social gatherings on a
regular basis, I believe,
although I could be wrong, that
more W&L students participate
in this group than in several
other funded groups. Viewed at
this level, the I.V.C.F. provides
a service to the student body
which should be allowed to have
student funds.

Now arises the question of
‘legitimizing’ a_ religious
group by granting it funds. One
member of the E.C. stated that
if the I.V.C.F. is granted funds
then if a ‘Jim Jones”’ type cult
comes in with 100 members, the
E.C. would be obliged to give
them funds. As far as I can see,
if an organization is deemed to
provide for a need of a signifi-
cant portion of the student body,
and no one disputes that the
1.V.C.F. does this, then it is en-
titled to a portion of the E.C.
funds set aside for this purpose.

In closing, I would like to sug-
gest that the E.C. investigate
the possibility that there could

 

be a significant difference in the
respective intents of the U.S.
Constitution and the W&L stu-
dent government. Also, I for one
would be interested in seeing
how other student governments
at different institutions had
handled this problem.
Sincerely,
Frank L. Eppes ’83

Butiiod About Rubbers

Dear Sir:

I would like to call your atten-
tion to two advertisements from
the second page of your Sept. 17
issue of the Ring-tum Phi, one
for McCrums’ and the other for
Herring Travel.

There are certain things in
life that go without saying, and
surely you must be aware that
the ad for Trojans prophylac-
tics is to say the least inap-
propriate for a_ college

newspaper’ (university
newspaper?) with a wide cir-
culation. The fact that W&L
students have used the product
for years has nothing to do with
the bad taste of the ad.

The other ad has a typograph-
ical error. It should read ‘‘Se
habla espanol.”’

I hope you will be more
discreet in future issues.

Sincerely,
Robert L. Amsler

Students returning to Lexington this fall have been thrust before

“la television screen crammed with three new channels, increasing

competition and viewer frustration in more ways than one.
Ted Turner can be thanked, or blamed, for most of the current

_|video onslaught. It is his Channel 17, his ESPN and his Cable Net-

work News (CNN) that have changed the general picture. The
other addition is the Christian Broadcast Network (CBN), with 700

_|Club host Pat Robertson talking up a host of religious fanatics,
“lright-wing lunatics and other assorted jingoes.

When Alf Goodykoontz, editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch,
was at W&L last winter he addressed the subject of growing cable
echnology. He said that, with all the new channels popping up and
little original programming available, the stations would be forced

 

“Jto show products, he put it, ‘from 1937.” He was right; old flicks

and re-runs fill the bill.
And the bill is full, however light. It is the movie addict's dream

_for nightmare, depending on the extent of addiction. A few weeks
“Jago, for instance, at 1 in the afternoon, there was Dinner at Eight on

 

5, Intermezzo on 20, and All Through the Night, with Carole Lombard,
on 17. Bliss or agony.

 

The re-runs are thrown about much more recklessly, although

If less than half of the student
body turns out next week to vote
on the constitutional referen-
dum’ the Executive Committee
faces another year of frustra-
tion.

Polls will be open Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday.

Of the seven proposals, no. 3,
which will make it easier to
amend the constitution, no. 4,
which allows the law school
earlier representation on the
Committee, and no. 7, which
clears up cloudy language to
establish the E.C. as_ the
reviewer of decisions made by
the Publications Board, are the
most important of the proposed
revisions.

A two thirds majority of
ballots cast will approve the
revisions.

Elimination of the office of
treasurer is the intent of Pro-
posal 1. The E.C. has functioned

 

for several years without a
treasurer and wants to update
this section.

Membership criteria would
be clarified for the Publications
Board by Proposal 2. This spells
out the positions of two
members-at-large on the Pub
Board, which chooses editors
and business managers for
theAriel, Calyx, and Ring-tum
Phi.

The most important of the
proposed revisions is the third
which states that only on third
of the student body need vote,
with two thirds’ approval, for
amendments to the constitu-
tion. Fifty percent participation
in a referendum is now re-
quired. Despite several at-
tempts to amend the constituion
last year, a majority of students
never turned out to cast ballots
at one time, and idiosyncracies
have not been purged.

One such idiosyncracy is law
school elections. The constitu-

Myers also noted that E.C.
members were asked by Dr.
Edward Hamer to serve on

rules were set for freshman and
first year law student elections.
Seven students applied for
Freshman Class President, six
applied for Vice President,

seven for E.C. Representative,
and seven law students applied
for the E.C. first year law stu-
dent position.

Freshmen are allowed to

spend no more than $10 and
have no more than 15 posters, to

be put in the dorms, in the R.E.
Lee Hotel, and the dining hall.
Law students may place posters
in the dining hall and the law
school.

EC Proposes Seven Amendments

tion specifies the third Monday
in October for freshman and
first year law class elections.
After this was established in the
constitution, the law school
calendar changed, and they are
now in school for ten weeks
before represented on the E.C.
The fourth proposal would man-
date elections in the sixth week
of classes, no matter what the
date.

The date when the E.C. swit-
ches from old to new members
is clarified by Proposal 5. Of-
ficers elected in the spring are
supposed to enter office after
commencement, but the con-
stitution does not specify
whether that is the under-
graduate or the law school com-
mencment. This revision would
specify that each would com-
mence with his office after the
commencement of his own col-
lege.

Proposal 6 throws a modify-
ing phrase into the constitution
so that a request from the Ex-
ecutive Committee “‘now in of-
fice’ will result in a student
body meeting.

What “‘appelate jurisdiction”
means, no one knows, and this
year’s E.C. thinks it means that
all decisions by the Publications
Board, to which the term ap-
plies in the constitution, are
subject to review and rejection
by the E.C., whether the Pub
Board appeals or not. The
seventh proposal makes clear a
subordination of the Pub Board
to the E.C.

is such an obnoxious personality it makes you wonder how he stays
on the air until you realize how many fat and otherwise vacant
women occupy this great nation of ours. Simmons is such a limp-
wristed flit that even to sit through one of his commercials is a
nerve wrenching ordeal. One spot features the fay star in an ornate
bubble bath, towel wrapped around his head, chattering on a
French telephone with one of his millions of obese fans. Sample:
“Oh hi, Helen, say, I’m going to be in the kitchen this afternoon
baking and stuff. You simply must come over and I’1] show you how
to make dough in the Vita-mix and some marvy low-cal salad
dressing...”

CNN is pretty good, spread expectedly thin (especially into the
wee hours). About its greatest advantage, other than being a cons-
tant source of news, is its live coverage of events usually seen only
in 2-14 minute spurts on the evening news. Most recently speeches,
press conferences, a funeral and museum dedication have been the
subjects of attention.

CBN is the pits. In addition to Pat Robertson’s gab and moralize
sessions it relies on one old movie per week, usually one of poor
visual quality with Rosalind Russell or Loretta Young, which runs
over and over. Plus old T.V. shows that haven’t seen the light of day
(deservedly so) since the Eisenhower administration: Life of Riley
with William Bendix, Bachelor Father with pre-Dynasty John For-
sythe and, of all things, Gale Storm in My Little Margie (yuk! ).

Some of the best oldies may be seen twice a day on different chan-
nels — M*A*S*H, All in the Family, some of the Carol Burnetts.
Bob Newhart and Mary Tyler Moore are not to be found. Channel 5
jerked I Love Lucy from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 a.m., a difficult time for
even the most die-hard fans. (The Ricardoes and the Mertzes, by
the way, were last spotted in Hollywood, and that whacky red-head
had hidden under Cornel Wilde’s breakfast cart).

At any rate, there aren’t enough good T.V. shows made in all
history to adequately fill the schedules of large metropolitan sta-
tions. Hour-long shows, such as the Rockford Files or The Waltons,
have become popular. But an hour is potentially dangerous to a
society overwhelmed by weak or apathetic minds. Drivel like the
Love Boat and violent crap like Starsky and Hutch can either numb
brain cells faster than drugs or fill impressionable minds with
dangerous ideas.

The only conceivable redemption imposed by having more chan
nels is a larger array of refuse from which to choose. If this selec-
tion ran the gamut from awful to decent it would be one thing; as it
is, for the most part, a pot pourri of mediocrity lies waiting at our
fingertips.

Of course, I never watch T.V.

Fall Lecture Series, “The Art
and Architecture of England,”
next week.

On Mon. Oct. 19 at 4:30 p.m.,
world-famous potter David
Leach will lecture in Northen
Auditorium of the University
Library. The lecture is entitled
“Fifty Years With and Without
Bernard Leach.”’

David Leach is the son of Ber-
nard Leach, who led the English
studio pottery movement in the
early years of this century.

At the age of 19, David Leach
began to work in his father’s
pottery at St. Ives. A teacher,
writer and popular lecturer, he
has exhibited in Europe, the
United States, and the Far
East.

In 1950, he designed and made
the David Leach Electric Kiln.
And in 1966, he started a
workshop at Bovey Travey,
where he now makes a large
percentage of porcelain.

On Tuesday, Oct. 20, Sheldon
Rothblatt, professor of history
at the University of California
at Berkeley, will lecture on
“Culture and Horticulture: The
English Garden in the 18th Cen-
tury.” Rothblatt’s lecture is at 8
p.m. in duPont Auditorium.

A native of Los Angeles, Roth-
blatt specializes in graduate
and undergraduate courses in
British and European history at
Berkeley, where he has taught
since 1963. Educated at
Berkeley and King’s College of
Cambridge University,
Rothblatt is also associate
director of the Center for
Studies in Higher Education at
Berkeley.

He has been a Woodrow
Wilson Fellow and was the
Ehrman Student at King’s Col-
lege, Cambridge. He has been a
Social Science Research Coun-
cil Faculty Fellow in London, a
Shelby Cullom Davis Fellow at
the Davis Center of Princeton
University, a Guggenheim
Fellow and Visitor of Nuffield
College, Oxford University, and
a scholar-in-residence at the
Rockefeller Center in Bellagio,

Italy.

Rothblatt is the author of two
books, ‘‘The Revolution of the
Dons: Cambridge and Society
in Victorian London’’ (1968) and
“Tradition and Change ‘in
English Liberal Education: An

ing at Virginia Military In-
stitute on Wednesday, Oct. 21.
His topic at VMI is ‘The
Growth of Victorian London.”’
The lecture will be at 8 p.m. in

Nichols Hall.

On Wednesday, Oct. 21, David
Durant, well-known English
author, lecturer and _ broad-
caster, will discuss ‘“The Great
Era of English Portrait Paint-
ing’ at 8 p.m. in duPont
Auditorium.

Durant’s most recent books
include biographies of Bess of
Hardwick and Lady Arbella
Stuart as well as a study of
Raleigh’s Lost Colony. His
study of these famous people
has led him to an intensive in-
vestigation of the great tradi-
tion of English portraiture.

All the lectures are open to
the public and are free.

MD Has Smashing Time At Pavilion

The 1981-82 fund raising drive
for Muscular Dystrophy began
with a bang Saturday with a car
smash at Zollman’s Pavilion.

The four-door Dodge Dart,
donated by James and Sons
Used Auto Parts of Lexington,
was belted almost 400 times by
party-goers at the Pavillion. At
25 cents a hit, the project raised
about $99 for the Muscular

Dystrophy Association.

The only expense incurred
from the event was two broken
sledgehammers. According to
Superdance Publicity Chair-
man Brian Gibson, the car
smash will likely become an an-
nual event in conjunction with
Homecoming.

The car smash marked the
beginning of this year’s

Muscular Dystrophy fund rais-
ing drive, which culminates in
the fourth Annual Superdance
Jan. 29-31. The 30-hour dance
marathon will again feature a
variety of bands and activities.

Contact Carole Chappell if in-
terested in serving on a com-
mittee for the dance or if you
would like to dance in the
marathon itself.

Simpson Proves To Be A Not-So-Average Dean

test of the Cambodian incursion. I finally got the thesis in two days
later — once they released the school’s president,”’ she recalls with
a laugh.

“I’m pretty liberal...a humanist. There is no reason at all why the
ERA should not be passed,”’ she says, citing the feminist movement
as one reason she holds her current administrative post. She
doesn’t mind admitting that she thinks W&L will be co-ed in
another ten years: ‘‘for financial reasons if nothing else, but
hopefully because we realize it’s in our best interests...women in
= classroom would make W&L a more human and interesting
place.”’

Simpson feels co-education at W&L could change the hard drink-
ing fraternity social life, one of the things she dislikes. “If the
macho climate changed, so would the social life.’’ She recalls a
favorite quote to illustrate her point: ‘‘‘The definition of a Southern
Gentleman is a W&L student who apologizes after vomiting on his
date’s dress.’ Hopefully, our gentlemen will be more than that and
respect the rights, desires, and feelings of other people.”

Dean Simpson finds the modern drug culture very frightening.
“Marijuana must be handled like alcohol — with an attitude of
maturity and an understanding of one’s behavior,” she says,
stressing that the drug is illegal.

Her attitudes on sex echo those she holds on drugs. ‘‘Sex is like
dynamite...it has to be handled maturely or people are going to get
hurt,” she says. She feels that sexual experience before marriage
is part of today’s society. Regarding. homosexuality: ‘There are
for one reason or another a good deal of people who prefer sex with
members of the same sex. Society or no one else has a right to in-
terfere with things done between mature, consenting adults ir
privacy.”’

On the issue of abortion the dean comments, “I don’t like the idea
of abortion as a birth control method, but it is an alternative if all
else fails.” She believes that women have a right to their own

bodies and their own lives, and that’s one reason the Moral Majori-

ty frightens her.

“The Moral Majority members are not true conservatives. True
conservatives don’t want laws controlling life and that is what
these people want,’’ she says. Her own religious beliefs are describ-
ed by her as somewhat agnostic. ‘I’m a humanist, that is someone
who sees their belief in context of all beliefs and not necessarily as
truth.’’ Raised in the Lutheran Church and now attending the
Episcopal Church, Pam says: ‘‘I have a concept of a divine being
and moral values. If there is a God and after-life, fine — but it’s
really rather irrelevant now. Our problems here have to be worked
out among ourselves, but not by divine intervention.”

Dr. Simpson sees the current political situation as negating a lot
of advances made by liberal thinkers. “‘I dislike everything Reagan
has done. Under his programs, the ones who can stand the least to
suffer (financially ) are the ones that will.”

Simpson stressed that her outspoken views are not necessarily
shared by W&L but the professor is inclined more toward art than
politics anyway. After marrying in 1970, she received her doctorate
from the University of Delaware, which she claims to be the best
school for her specialty —American architecture. This specialty
led her in conjunction with Royster Lyle to write The Architecture
of Historic Lexington. A grant from the National Endowment for
the Humanities in 1974 resulted in the completed work in 1975.

The book, dealing with the high-style architecture found in the
Lexington area, was published by the University of Virginia press
in 1977. Since that time Simpson and Lyle have been researching
vernacular architecture found within Rockbridge County and
hopes to have her work ready for publication in the next two years.
She has the raw data (a study of over 300 pre-1817 houses) and now
must assemble it.

Where is this expert art historian, self-acclaimed “original
bleeding-heart liberal”’ going to be in ten years? Right here.

“I’m terribly happy here at W&L and see no reason to leave,’’ she
smiles. In the meantime, she’ll be working for changes at W&L in
the areas of minority enrollment and co-education, drinking half-
cups of coffee, and smoking True menthol cigarettes.
