Investigators Suspect Arson

As Cause Of Sigma Nu Fire

by Patrick Jordan

A suspicious early-morning
fire broke out at the Sigma Nu
fraternity Saturday causing
damage to the basement and
first two floors of the house.

According to Bryan Causey,
Chief of the Lexington Fire
Department, the blaze started
and was contained in the base-
ment of the house, but smoke
reached the second floor of the
structure. Causey said no
damage estimates had yet been
made.

Causey said that a State Ar-
son Bureau investigator from
Salem had completed a
preliminary investigation by
Saturday afternoon and had

concluded that the fire was
“suspicious in nature and that
arson could have been involv-
ed.”

Findings from a second in-
vestigation conducted by Salem
Arson Bureau investigator L.R.
Thomas on Monday afternoon
have also yet to be released.

Lexington Police Officer
Torben Pedersen said an
unknown male called police
about 4:30 a.m. to report a fire
“at one of the fraternity houses
on Henry Street, but he did not
know which.’’ Pedersen said the
man failed to identify himself.

William C. Datz, assistant
Washington and Lee University
proctor, had accompanied

 

Smoke rose from the basement of the SNU house and caused this

damage in the living room.

Thomas during part of the se-
cond investigation completed at}
the fraternity.

“Apparently, two fires hadi
originated in the basement of
the fraternity,’’ Datz said. ‘‘One
had started in the right front
part of the basement while
another had broken out directly
underneath the kitchen.”’

Datz said he noticed several
cans of flammable liquid in the
basement and he added that
some chairs and bookcases had
been piled up in the corner of
the basement.

According to Lewis John,
Dean of Students at W&L, no
Sigma Nu fraternity members
have been living in the house
since June 8.

In addition, John dismissed a
rumor that several townspeople

~had periodically lived in the

basement at Sigma Nu.

House members were evicted
as a result of an order from the
Student Affairs Committee
(SAC), principally because of
poor living conditions and a
failure to pay past financial
obligations.

John said the house has run
up debts amounting to close to
$7000 to local merchants and the
fraternity owes approximately
$25,000 in mortgage payments
to the University.

John added that on Nov. 10,

 

The SNU house has been placed off-limits as investigators ex-
amine the cause of Saturday’s fire.

the SAC withdrew recognition
of the Washington and Lee
Chapter of the fraternity.

According to Maurice §Lit-
tlefield, the Executive Director
of Sigma Nu, a recommenda-
tion haS been forwarded to
Sigma Nu board members that
the national chapter assume the
debts owed to the University.

Littlefield said he has receiv-
ed some early indications that
the national board will approve
the motion.

Littlefield added that the
debts to the merchants incurred
by the W&L chapter could not
be paid by the national fraterni-
ty.

According to John, Littlefield
has expressed an interest in

rebuilding the fraternity with a
new nucleus of members.

The 100th anniversary of the
founding of Sigma Nu at
Washington and Lee will be
next year.

In a separate incident, Sigma
Nu treasurer John Solitario said
the book containing records of
the fraternity’s debts is miss-
ing.

Solitario.said he had kept the
records in his apartment at 114
E. Nelson St.

He said he noticed that the
records were missing Thursday
night and that he contacted the
Coordinator of Fraternity Af-
fairs Dan Murphy about the
disappearance the following
day.

 

 

SPJ’s Washington To-Do:

Interesting,

by John Wells

All things considered, the
three-day convention of the
Society of Professional Jour-
nalists held in our nation’s
capital last week was an in-
teresting if wunriveting ex-'
perience. The location for the
conclave — a couple of blocks
from Capitol Hill and a brief
crow’s fly from the White House

 

— made it far less lacklustre
than some previous conven-
tions. The brewing situations
surrounding administration
figures David Stockman and
Richard Allen lent an air of
real-life drama to proceedings
which were otherwise pretty
unreal.

The setting for the goings-on
was Washington’s Hyatt Regen-

Unriveting

cy Hotel, probably as ugly and
outrageously expensive
stopover as one could possibly
imagine. Our not very spacious
room contained no stationery,
an enormous orange lamp and
an anemic-looking plant with a
sign saying ‘‘Don’t Water Me.”
Cute. Carla Hall of the
Washington Post summed up
the Hyatt’s decor in a sentence
describing conventioneers ‘“‘sip-
ping coffee at tables adorned
with orange fabric flowers in
plastic pots.”” Guests were ex-
pected to become drunk with
extravagance over such
hifalutin’ freebies as Hyatt bath
bouquet containing real mink
oil.

Following registration
Wednesday evening, SPJ
members wandered around the
Hill until they found the Russell
building, where the Senate
Caucus Room was the site of a
champagne reception for the
arriving guests. The event was
supposed to be hosted by
Senators Mathias and Warner,
and the crowd was full of
whispered curiosity (‘‘I wonder

Crash Inquiry At Standstill

by Patrick Jordan
Lexington Police officers
have reached a standstill in
their investigation into how a
patrol car mysteriously rolled
and hit a brick wall Oct. 3 dur-
ing a fraternity party.

 

THE POLICE
LAS ake

 

 

 

THE END?

 

According to Lexington
Police Officer Torben Ped-
ersen, a few leads are still being
pursued but he said most in-
quiries have reached ‘‘a
waiting-game stage.”

Pedersen said that the police
department is still concen-
trating its efforts on the
assumption that a Washington
and Lee student is responsible
for the wreck.

Pedersen had entered the
Sigma Nu fraternity house
about 1:00 a.m. to close down a
band for playing too loud.

Pedersen said that he parked
the patrol car in front of the
house at 4 Henry St., put the
transmission in park, removed
the keys and left the doors
unlocked before entering the
fraternity.

After stopping the band,
Pedersen said he returned five
minutes later to discover his
car smashed against the war
memorial at the entrance of
W&L University. Damage to the
car was estimated at $1000.

Pedersen said he has ques-
tioned several students who
contend that they saw another
student dressed in a ‘‘preppy
manner” get into the police car
and shift it out of park.

University Proctor Charles
Murray, who is assisting the
Lexington Police Department
in the case, said that although
some admitted seeing this stu-
dent get into the patrol car,
none have been able to identify
him.

Pedersen explained that
although the Ford model patrol

 

car has an inherent mechanical
problem in the transmission, it
would have taken some force to
have initiated the car’s move-
ment down the street in front of
the fraternity.

Pedersen said because of the
mechanical defect, the car can
be taken out of park when the
keys are out of the ignition.

But Pedersen emphasized

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Pe

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Rambling Thoughts

One of the less pleasant aspects of putting out a
paper this week is the realization that only half of the
campus will be around on Thursday afternoon and
Friday to read this. Anyway, here are a few thoughts
that our staff compiled when trying to come up with
an editorial:

- Perhaps no SNU news is indeed good news, as last
Saturday’s fire demonstrates. With the Beta couch-
torching of a few weeks ago and now the SNU blaze,
Red Square has been making life hectic for the Lex-
ington Fire Department on Saturdav nights. Mean-
while, the SNU rumor mills continue to grind out in-
teresting iotas, including the one that the brotherhood
has dissolved. If this is the case, will the boys regroup
for their centennial which occurs in the near future?

- Both the football and water polo squads finished
their respective seasons with higher-than-expected
achievements. The football team won eight, lost two,
and won its conference. The polo men (don’t worry,
we won’t call you mermen) won 31 games, the most
by any team on the east coast. Oh}yés, we'll mention
the cross-country team which: scored big in its
regional meet. We don’t mean to slight you, believe it
or not.

Isn’t Thanksgiving a really neat holiday? And isn’t
the weather in Lexington really neat?’ And isn’t it
really neat that most of us have three tests and five
papers due by 5 p.m. Friday? And isn’t it neat that we
don’t have school for a week? And isn’t it neat that we
can incorporate all these really neat raat into one
incredibly neat editorial?

See you in two weeks.

Is The Phi A Chauvinist Pig?

Dear Sir:

I,wish to register a protest
about ;the “cartoon” that ap-
peared in the Oct. 29 issue of the
Phi, The drawing, prominently
located on the top of the front
page of the Parent’s Weekend
issue, depicted a student with
his parents.

Connected to each figure’ s
head was a balloon apparently
indicating that person’s
thoughts. Above the student’s
head was a balloon enclosing a
drink and above the father’s
head was a dollar sign. But the
balloon above the mother’s
head was empty. The implica-
tion, of course, was that the
woman had no thoughts at all.

Naturally, this drawing an-

noyed many of the women on
campus and several of our male
colleagues have expressed
similar disgust. It is not that
this particular cartoon is
outrageously offensive. The

 

point is that the Phi regularly
prints equally stereotypical
material. The cartoon was not
even funny, and added nothing

to the article it accompanied.
Parts of your newspaper are
of a good quality. If you would
resist insulting your readers
with offensive pranks like that
cartoon, perhaps the remainder
would reach that level also.

Sincerely
Terry J. McKenney
83 Law

 

 

Correction

- Last week’s editorial, ‘“‘Don’t
Nobody Bring Me No Bad
News,” misquoted Bill Roberts.
Referring to the Ring-tum
Phi, Roberts said, ‘‘The
pererenet here stinks.”’

 

 

Grad Praises Darrell’s Food

This letter was written by Bob
Willis, 81, who is currently study-

Mr. Jerry Darrell

Director of Food Service
Washington & Lee University
Lexington, Va. 24450 USA

Dear Mr. Darrell,

I just wanted to drop a quick
note expressing my apprecia-
tion.

I realize that while I was at
W&L I was fortunate in having
an outstanding food service, but
I never knew how outstanding
until I left Lexington. As you
may know, I’m presently at the
University of St. Andrews in
Scotland, and our eating ar-
rangement is a monstrosity !

Although I’m supposed to be
eating in the most exclusive
graduate dining hall, both the
quality of the food and staff is
surprisingly poor. For example,

every meal has potatoes, in-
cluding the chow mein which
comes on french fries! There
are no salads, no seconds, and
no second choices unless you

Our only beverage is water —
no tea, coffee, milk, coke or
even ice. Finally, because the

new supplies except once a

month, we’ve been without.

napkins for weeks.

So thanks, thanks for all the
salad bars, beverages, and
basically good meals. I can
assure you that your service
makes all the difference in a
college experience.

Take care,
Bob Willis ’81

Dear Sir:

In your Nov. 12 lead story

For his $1 per year “‘salary”’ as

E.C. Hears Symposium Details

by Todd Smith
A name-change for the In-
tellectual Symposium and plans

for its first year were presented .

to the Executive Committee
Monday night.

The E.C. also set a freshman
class meeting and heard
reports concerning the Publica-
tions Board, the Computer Club
and the Emergency Loan Com-
mittee.

Bill Archer, the new chair-
man of the Intellectual Sym-
posium Committee, reported
that the new name would be
“Focus: an Interdisciplinary
Symposium.’”’ The committee
plans to have monthly
‘“‘forums”’ to discuss non-
political matters of wide in-
terest. The first forum will treat
“Limited Nuclear War.’’ Each
forum topic will be discussed in
a “Journal” enlisting student
articles.

The Journal will also drum up
interest in the Spring term
‘“‘Mini-Symposium.’’ This event
will treat a theme, still open to
suggestions, and will revolve
around a ‘‘town meeting.’’ The
first symposium to conform to
the original recommendation
will come in 1986.

The original recommendation .

came from a Liberal Education
Committee, set up by the presi-
dent of the university. An ad hoc
group of the University Com-
mittee examined the problem
and set down its suggestions in
a white paper.

Tripp Brower, ’82 Rep., who
served on the ad-hoc commit-
tee, asked Archer if the white
paper was to be followed. Ar-
cher replied that it was useful,
but too ‘grandiose’ for this
year.

Ben Hale, ’84 Rep., and
Brower asked the committee to
bring faculty members into the
Symposium on a regular basis.
The E.C. suggested Halford
Ryan and Ramsey Martin as in-
terested professors.

Archer said that he had found
several interested faculty
members: David Bausum, Car-

ren Kaston, Steven Olson, Har-
rison Pemberton Jr., and
Thomas Williams who also
served on the committee.

A special meeting is being
planned for law students.

Honor and Exams

In other action, the E.C. voted
to call a meeting of the
freshman class. President Eric
Myers voiced concern that
students would begin to abuse
the honor system concerning
exams if the Committee failed
to effectively inform freshmen.
Last year’s E.C. did not hold a
class meeting.

The exam policy was loosen-
ed up several years ago by the
faculty to allow students to
schedule their exams as they
wished, said Myers.

“Professors here are not

usually willing to go along with
changes, for instance, pass-fail
courses, like other colleges,”
said Myers, warning that they
might rescind the policy if abus-
ed.

Pub Board

Ken Lang reported that The
Publications Board had
reinstated Rob Willis and Ed-
ward Gonsalves as_ student
representatives, without voting
rights.

The two had been rescinded
by the E.C. last week in an ef-
fort to comply with the Constitu-
tional referendum of late Oc-
tober. Lang reported that the
Pub Board had the positions
laid out in its own constitution.

Computer Club

Jay O’Brien reported that the

Computer Club had written its

constitution and applied for
membership in the National
Association of Computing
Machinery.

O’Brien said that Lee
Feldman had worked out a plan
with the Mock Convention, and
that the Convention’s computer
would be available to students
for tutoring sessions.

SELC

Eric Koltz reported that the
Emergency Loan Committee
had lent money to only two
students. He conceded that
“there may be a_ definite
knowledge problem’’ of
students unaware of the
available resources.

Koltz said that he had already
placed an advertisement in the
Ring-tum Phi this year alerting
students to the committee.

Mollenhoff Gives Testimony

Washington & Lee University
journalism professor Clark R.
Mollenhoff testified before a
Congressional subcommittee
last week on the use of ‘‘ex-
ecutive privilege’ by Interior
Secretary James Watt.

Mollenhoff told the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and
Investigations of the House
Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee that Congress should
take “direct contempt of Con-
gress action against Secretary
Watt”’ for his refusal to provide
31 documents to the House Com-
mittee on Energy and Com-
merce.

“In the end,’’ said Mollenhoff,
“this will be a service to Mr.
Watt, President Reagan and the
taxpayers.”

Mollenhoff, a Pulitzer Prize-
winning investigative reporter
who formerly was Washington
bureau chief for the Des Moines
Register and Tribune, was in-
vited to testify as an expert
witness on the subject of ‘‘ex-
ecutive privilege.”. He has
closely followed the administra-

 

 

Should We

Dear Sir:

I trust you took time to
scrutinize your November 7
editorial “Don’t Nobody Bring
Me No Bad News” for contained
within it were several points
worth your consideration...

..such as the statement ‘‘our
humble staff is not trendy
enough for this electric cam-
pus.’ Should newspapers strive
for a trendy reputation? Or
should they strive to retain their
status as fair purveyors of
news, opinion, and features’...

_..and if the ‘‘campus Pulitzer
winner”’ doesn’t follow the Phi,
maybe the Phi should endeavor
to attain such a status (see
above) whereby all important
people in the omnia would

make it a point to follow...

..and it might be worthwhile
to study a merger withThe Law
News. Not that the Phi can
“learn gobs about how real
newspapers work”’ but that it
may enlist the honed writing
skills of impartial observers,
ones who themselves may enjoy
reporting on events outside
their immediate environment.
Ones who, by their previous
association with undergraduate
publications, can lend quality
assistance.

We’d like to love you. Please
give us solid reasons to do so.

tions of seven U.S. presidents.

Referring to his experiences
with previous administrations
Mollenhoff told the subcom-
mittee that in the past 25'years
“one of the major impediments
to full investigations by Con-
gress has been the claim of ‘ex-
ecutive privilege’ laid down by
various agencies of govern-
ment. Most of the time the
claim of ‘executive privilege’
has been nothing but a cover-up
of corruption, mismanagement
or improprieties in various ex-
ecutive agencies and was not
the least in the national in-
terest.”

Mollenhoff argued that ‘“‘any
president who permits his
cabinet officers to use a claim
of ‘executive privilege’ to hide
information from Congress, is
taking a long step down a slip-
pery slope. He is opening a Pan-
dora’s Box in giving any sup-

port to this pernicious:doctrine,
and it will come back to haunt
him as it has past prrerent. .

Acknowledging that Presi-
dent Reagan ‘“‘still projects a
personal image’ of an honest,
forthright man,” Mollenhoff
said that even he ‘‘can seriously
damage that image and that
strength if it is perceived by the
public that he is not open and
forthright; if it is believed he is
permitting Cabinet officers to
use ‘executive privilege’ to
cover up questionable actions.”’

Mollenhoff had previously ap-

peared before Congressional
subcommittees as a witness on
the use of ‘executive priv-
ilege.” Last Friday he and
former Oversight and Investi-
gation subcommittee chairman
John Moss (D-Cal.) read
statements and were question-
z ogg members of the commit-

Pedersen said if the in-
dividual responsible is ap-

with setting a motor vehicle in

Local Man

Arrested
In Fight

At Cockpit

by Patrick Jordan

A Lexington man was ar-
rested early Sunday morning
after a fight interrupted a rock
band performing at Washington
& Lee University’s Cockpit.

Paul Ruley, 36, of 299
\icLaughlin St., was arrested

ud charged with being drunk
. 1 public and resisting arrest in
connection with the early morn-
ing incident.

According to Bill Benson, a
manager at the Cockpit, Ruley
had tried to start a fight with a
performer in the rock band
“Late Shift”? during one of the
group’s breaks.

Benson said when the bass
player ignored Ruley’s request.
Ruley started to verbally abuse
the performer's girl friend who
then threw a beer in Ruley’s
face.

At this point, Benson said, the
band member came off the
stage and punched Ruley.

‘‘Some of the other attendants
at th.e Cockpit and I took Rule
outside toward the bathroom
and I locked the door behind us
so that the crowd would not
follow,’ Benson said. ‘I then
called the police and told them
to meet me _ outside of the

University Center.” +
According to Lexington
Police Officer Torben
Pedersen, some of Ruley’s

friends were trying to get him
into a car to go home, but he
was resisting their efforts.

Pedersen said the police hac!
no intention of arresting Rule,
initially and that they were in-
terested solely in breaking up
any additional fights.

According to Benson, while
Ruley was being escorted into
his girl friend’s car, he hit one
of the policemen with an errant
swing of his arm and also broke
one of the door windows.

Benson said the police then
handcuffed Ruley and placed
him ina police car.

Benson said Washington &
Lee University Proctor Charles
Murray will most likely issue
trespass warrants for Ruley
and two of his friends forbid-
ding them to come on campus
indefinitely.

Benson said this would be
done just to avoid any possibili-
ty of future disturbances.

Talk Of The Town

by John Cleghorn

There’s a barber in town who
can talk about just about
anything. He spends a lot of
time reading the paper and
keeping up with what’s going
on. When you sit in his chair he
can talk with you about any sub-
ject in any field you bring up;
your home town (if it’s sizeable
enough to make the news);
sports, the government, just
about anything.

Football came up last time
and, as usual, we covered the
field. The plight of VMI and the
clash of Lexington and B.V.
were the main topics of discus-
sion. When the Generals came
up, the conversation waned. He
knew they had been doing well
but he simply wasn’t used to
talking about W&L in the same
breath as these other successful
teams.

Well, this year the Generals
slipped up on him.

Throughout the season people
noticed a win here, a win there
but haven’t followed too closely,
lest it get boring. They find out
on Monday or Tuesday, by
chance, if the Generals won or
not. Pretty soon all these wins

added up and, what do you
know, they won the ODAC.
Maybe Washington & Lee ought
to borrow Rodney Dangerfield
from the University of
Maryland.

W&L was projected to win the
ODAC and they indeed did.
They won games they had to.
They didn’t choke and lose any
they weren’t supposed to, which
is not as easy as it sounds. They
developed a diversified and
threatening offense. The
defense evolved into the
strongest in the conference with
the ability to hold the Generals
in the lead once they gained it.
Hopefully, the Generals have
earned the respect they have
deserved all season.

While everybody is trying to
project who goes to which bowl
and who will end up as the
number-one team in college
football, they ought to keep in
mind that W&L has achieved
the same goal as Georgia and
SMU have and what Michigan
and USC might. Although W&L
has been voted out of post-
season play, it stands as the

best in the category it competes
in.

Gridders Stomp Georgetown ,

Named ODAC Champs

by Dale Park

Last Saturday, the
Washington & Lee varsity foot-
ball team exploded for 35
second-half points to crush
visiting Georgetown Universi-
ty, 43-15. In recording its sixth
consecutive triumph, W&L
finished its regular season at
8-2.

After the game the Generals
learned that, because of a 10-10
tie between rivals Randolph-
Macon and Hampden-Sydney,
W&L had become the Old
Dominon Athletic Conference
champion. The tie had knocked
Randolph-Macon out of the title
race, and W&L had become
champions by virtue of a win
over Maryville earlier this
season.

“It was a story-book finish,”
said head coach Gary Fallon. “‘I
hope it doesn’t happen just once
in a lifetime because we all had
a great day.”

The Generals certainly did
have a great day against the

Hoyas. W&L scored the first
two times they got the ball in
the third quarter; breaking
open an 8-8 halftime score to
move ahead for good. At the

game’s, end, the Generals had
scored on five of nine second-

half possessions, rolling up a,

season high 426 yards total
offense while picking off four
Georgetown passes.

Sophomore quarterback Al
Paradise led the way for the
Generals, scoring on runs of two
and three yards (including a
two-point conversion run) while
throwing touchdown passes of
14 yards to junior Jerry Thomp-
son and 72 yards to senior Mike
Fogarty.

Other W&L scorers included
junior Pat McGuire on a six-
yard run McGuire led all rush-

Regional Championships

Two HarriersIn Top Ten

by Rick Swagler

For the first time since 1978,
W&L has succeeded in placing a
man in the top ten of the NCAA
Division III Regional Cham-
pionships. In fact, this year, two
W&L runners finished in the top
ten.

Saturday, at Fisk University
in Nashville, Angus McBryde
led the Generals’ cross-country
team to a fourth place finish.
McBryde finished eighth with a
phenomenal time of 25: 47.1.

This is not to say, however,
that McBryde’s time was the
only fast one.

All five of the Generals mak-
ing the trip set personal records
at the meet. Frank Pittman
finished in the top ten also at
tenth place with a 25:58.5. Cap-

head coach. ‘I’m especially
happy for the 13 seniors who
were my first batch of recruits,
happy that they can finish as
winners after providing so
much of the effort which has
built this program. But with
them out of the picture we now
look to the ones who will replace
them next season. Those

for a season in which our op-
ponents will probably put us on
a pedestal and fire away.”’

regionals next year. Incidental-
ly, that meet will be run at
Lynchburg College next year
and is tentatively scheduled to
come to the W&L course in 1986.
Frank Pittman commented
that ‘“‘the times were just in-
credible. We’ll be a lot tougher
next year.’”’ Captain Greg
Branan characterized the meet
as a “‘super sensational end to a
fantastic season. Everybody
pulled together this year.”’

Not surprisingly, the meet
pleased Coach Dick Miller. ‘“‘We
ran as well as we've run all
season. You can never com-
plain about a meet like that.
The team should be proud of the
whole season.”’

Miller noted that three out of
the top four teams at the
regionals were ODAC teams
—Roanoke College, second;
Lynchburg College, third; and
W&L, fourth. The University of
the South won the meet.

Looking forward to next
year’s NCAA Regionals at
Lynchburg, Miller has some
reservations about a big meet
on Lynchburg’s course. As it
stands, the Lynchburg course is
narrow in many places and has
too small a starting area for a
large number of runners.

Overall, the team finished
with an 8-3 record under the
leadership of Miller and
Branan, and next year the cap-
tain of the team will be Jon
Kelafant. As Branan comment-
ed, ‘‘I’m going to miss it. It’s go-
ing to be a lot different not runn-
ing competitively. I don’t know
if l’ll keep running at all.”’
Rockets Slip By Polo, W&L En

by G. Bruce Potter

Washington & Lee’s best-ever
water polo season had ended
barely 24 hours previously but
head coach Page Remillard
was already looking ahead nine
months to the start of next
year’s season.

‘“‘We’ve been bombarded with
letters from qualified ap-
plicants all over the country,”’
he said, adding that all he’d
done that day was work on
recruiting.

The Generals will only lose
one player, Mike Bernot, from
this year’s squad that improved
their record to 31-5 with a fifth
place finish in the Eastern In-
tercollegiate Championships
last weekend.

Slippery Rock State College
(Pa.) handed the Generals an
18-14 defeat in the first-round of
the eight-team event. However,
W&L, which was the fifth seed,
rebounded to sink Richmond,
10-4, and Harvard, 11-8.

by G. Bruce Potter

Senior co-captains Ken Jaffe
and George Spears will lead the
Washington & Lee basketball
team as they open what head
Coach Verne Canfield calls a
“transition year’ on Saturday
against UNC-Greensboro in the
Warner Center at 2:00 p.m.

Although Spears broke two
fingers early last week, he is ex-
pected to see at least spot duty
and perhaps even start, accor-
ding to Canfield. ‘‘It just
depends on how he responds in
practice this week,”’ he said.

The Generals lost four let-
termen from last year’s 16-10
squad, and 12 of the 18 team
members are freshmen or

season and freshmen Jackson
MacFarlane and Scott Shannon
will see action at the center and
forward spots, respectively, ac-
cording to Canfield. The 18th-
year coach also added that one
of the major keys to the club’s
success this year will be to
develop depth.

Because it is such a young
team, said Canfield, ‘‘We will
take the time to teach good ball
control and fundamentals.’’ The
Generals will be installing a
multiple offense for the first
time this year. This new offense
will center on ball control, a

third quarters, but the opposite
would be true on this day as the
Rockets erupted for six goals to
take a 15-10 lead by the time the
quarter had ended.

“We got a little tired but still
tried to play at a fast pace,”’ ex-
plained Remillard. Junior Erik
Peterson led the Generals with
five goals for the game and
classmate Ken Johnstone chip-
ped in with three. However,
goalie Andy Gates only stopped
38 percent of the shots fired at
him.

“It was our best game of the
season,” is how Remillard
described the victory for fifth
place over Harvard. Prior to
the tournament, there had been
some controversy over the
seedings as Harvard, seeded
sixth, thought they should be
above W&L.

“There is no love lost between
the two teams,’’ “explained
Remillard. “It was excellent
water polo, and we played very
good team defense.”’

The game was close the whole
way, and Washington & Lee was

up 7-5 at the half. However,
Peterson, Johnstone and Rand
McClain each had two fouls at
that point (A player is kicked
out of the game for good if he
gets three fouls). Remillard

replaced Peterson with soph-
omore Keith Kadesky, who
gave the team a “tremendous
boost”’ by scoring ih his first 18
seconds of action. ‘‘When we
needed it, he (Kadesky) did it,”’
said Remillard. “Our bench
was extremely critical.”
Peterson shot 71 percent to

ds At 31-5

lead W&L with five goals, and
co-captain Tim Rock, shooting
100 percent, added two.

Against the University of
Richmond, Washington & Lee
controlled the pace better than
they had against Slippery Rock,
and the outcome was never in
doubt, according to Remillard.
In an impressive display of
balanced scoring, seven
Generals accounted for the ten
goals, led by Peterson,
Johnstone, and Bob Marshall
with two apiece.

Peterson’s twelve goals for
the three games upped his
single-season school record to
152, and Bernot closed out his
career with five goals to finish
the year with a personal high of
82, good for second place on the
squad. Johnstone finished the
tourney with seven goals and
Rock added five. In addition,
McClain and Peterson led the
team in assists with eight and
seven, respectively.

Gates stopped exactly 50 per-
cent of the opponents’ shots,
and the Generals converted on

power inside game, and shot
selection. Another key. will be
“how well our experienced
players adapt to the new offen-
sive system,” according td Can-
field. “The guys are adapting to
this very well. We’re right on
our time schedule.”

W&L has always employed a
multiple defense, and ‘‘we’ve
won championships because of
our defensive ability,’’ com-
mented Canfield.

The goal this year is for ‘‘the
team to play up to its fullest
potential and make an effort to
win,’’ explained Canfield. ‘‘The
kids may not play flawlessly,
but they will give an all-out ef-
fort every game.”’

The Old Dominion Athletic
Conference made a rule change
a few weeks ago eliminating the
jump ball except to start an
overtime period. Canfield was
the only coach voting against
this change. However, he ad-
mitted that it places an em-
phasis on defense: “A team can
create a jump ball situation by
playing good defense and get a
few ‘more possessions per
game.”’

Although the coaches voted
Hampden-Sydney College as
the pre-season ODAC favorite,
Canfield said that the ODAC
champion ‘‘must contend

 

against us.”” He described this
year as one of the strongest
ever for the’ conference.
“Everyone in the conference is
loaded with talent,’ he said.
‘We'll be ini the thick of the con-
ference race.”’

The Generals’ schedule this

year was described by Canfield
as “extremely tough.’’ Two of
their first five opponents, UNC-
Greensboro and Allegheny,
made the NCAA regionals last
year and their third game of the
year is on the road against
Hampden-Sydney on Dec. 1.

After opening at home on
Saturday, the squad will take to
the road to face Averett on Nov.
24 and Hampden-Sydney before
returning home against Shenan-
doah on Dec. 3 and Allegheny on
Dec. 9 They will then have
almost a month off for exams
and Christmas break before
getting into the heart of their
schedule.

Frank Eppes, starting center,
said that the ‘‘spirit of the team,

Restaurant

whether or not we really want to
win’’ will be a key along with

good rcbounding and good
defense. :

‘We're learning every day,’’
he said. ‘“‘We probably won’t be
pretty at the start of the season,
but by the end we'll be com-
petitive with anyone in the
ODAC.”

Canfield expressed the same
feelings, saying, ‘‘We’re still in-
experienced but will get
stronger as the season pro-
gresses.”’

Each season, Canfield, the se-
cond winningest basketball
coach in Virginia, comes up
with three letters as the team’s
motto for that year. This
season, those letters are P-F-D,
standing for positive, firm, and
demanding. The coaches are
being firm and demanding in
ensuring that everyone learns
and does so correctly, and the
players should be thinking
positive, according to Canfield.
He went on to explain that this
is essentially the first year of a
two or three year era at W&L.

Film Notes

 

Notorious (1946) A sublime romantic thriller from Alfred Hitch-
cock, starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. In the fast-paced
postwar scenario, Bergman is used by the government to spy on an
ex-Nazi leader up to no good in South America. In doing so, she
must marry him, putting her life and body on the line. Probably
Bergman’s sexiest role, with Grant in fine form as the American
agent and supporting roles filled expertly by Claude Rains and
Louis Calhern. Elegant black-and-white photography lends visual
distinction to a series of vintage Hitchcock heart-stoppers, in-
cluding a lot of suspense revolving around a certain key. The
backdrop for most of this highly-charged stuff is down in Rio.

tional Conference of Orien-
talists in May 1980 in Kyoto,
Japan, and in Japanese to the
Shin Buddhist Studies Depart-

ment of Ryukoku University in
June 1980.

The title of the article is
‘“Shinjin and Anjin: A study of
‘Faith’ in Shin Buddhist
History.”’ It was published in
the February 1981 issue of the
journal, a_ publication of
Ryukoku University in Kyoto.

Law Students Bringing Justice To Grade Schools

by B. Scott Tilley

Several members of the
Washington & Lee law fraterni-
ty, Phi Alpha Delta, are involv-
ed in a program to teach
various aspects of law to
students at six Rockbridge
County secondary and middle
schools.

The purpose of the program
according to second year law
Student, David ‘‘Freedi’’
Friedfeld, is ‘‘to help students
develop a skill in deciding what
is right and wrong under the
law, which will foster respon-
sibility and citizenship.”

The ‘Juvenile Justice Pro-

gram’’ at Washington & Lee is
only a small part of the national
program sponsored by the na-
tional chapter of Phi Alpha
Delta. The national chapter was
one of six organizations to
receive federal funding from
Congress for this project.

“They received half a million
dollars,” said Friedfeld, but
emphasized that ‘‘the money is
used for research and other
things by the national organiza-
tion. None is fed down to us.”’

The project involves going in-
to the classrooms and teaching
the students topics ranging
from the Bill of Rights to Cor-

rectional Institutions.
“Presentations can include
question and answer periods,

mock trials, films, or just
straight lectures,’ said
Friedfeld. Topics may be

presented in a one day presen-
tation, or can run in a series up
tosix days.

Friedfeld noted that ‘“‘mucho”’
work was involved with the pro-
gram. ‘‘We started last June.
We had to call the principals,
set the subjects up with
teachers in conferences, and
prepare the presentation, in ad-
dition to just presenting it.’’ He
emphasized that this is a lot

Tribal Customs In Big Lex?

by Tom Baker

Just as anthropologists are
beginning to show concern over
the disappearance of in-
digenous tribes in the Amazon
jungle, a group of W&L
sophomores is trying to recap-
ture some ancient tribal
customs through the use of
blowguns.

Although it has been used by
tribes indigenous to the Amazon
basin for hundreds of years,
Barry Waterman and Russ
Rosler are convinced that the
blowgun is “‘the weapon of the
future.” According to Water-
man, the blowgun is ‘“‘silent, ac-
curate, effective, sophisticated
and lethal.”’ Its ammunition is
reusable and the blowgun is
legal in all states except in
California and requires no
license.

Rosler pointed out that the
use of the blowgun is a cost-
cutting move as he can hunt
squirrels and other small game
and lessen his dependence on

store-bought food.
Although they have had no
prior experience with

blowguns, Rosler and Water-
man are so enthusiastic about
the weapon that they are think-
ing about starting a blowgun
club at W&L. Waterman adds

need to speculate, however,
as neither senator was ever
spotted.

Guests sipped bubbly and
perspired as they writhed in the
mob below the famous cut-glass
chandeliers; It was difficult to
imagine the Watergate and
Army-McCarthy hearings being
held there, though, due to the
chattering throng and a brass
band cranking out innocuous
tunes. For those able to squeeze
through layers of bodies there
was a table spread with cheese
and crackers, fruit, egg rolls,
cubed pork, miniature quiches
and water chestnuts wrapped in
bacon. The huge carved thrones
at either end of the room were
used by the help as shelves for
food boxes and dripping con-
tainers of ice.

continental breakfast of
sweetrolls and coffee, the con-
vention was officially opened by
SPJ president Howard Graves.
A roll call of delegates was
thankfully interrupted by an

Mrs. Graham is not a very

support of the Freedom of Infor-

subject to proposed changes by
the Reagan administration)
was loud and clear. She was
rather plain and business-like in
a bright red blouse and gray

she spoke. After her talk, I spot-

some of her work — I found her
to be a charming and even
dazzling escalator companion.
She was whisked off in a waiting
taxi and I proceeded for a first-
ever tour of the White House.
There, I could have sworn I saw
Nancy Reagan washing an
upstairs window, but the guard
said he didn’t think so. The
mansion was impressive,
serenely elegant, belying the
turmoil ensuing over in the ex-
ecutive offices with the
Stockman affair.

Back at the Hyatt, lunch was -

served at 12:30 in the ballroom,
which features chandeliers
shaped like upside-down jello
molds. Columnist Carl] Rowan
was the speaker. Our table was
served by a_ hostile-looking
Puerto Rican waitress who
muttered sullenly in her native

starters due to graduation.

Remillard said he couldn’t
think of any specific turning
point of the season, any point
where he realized the team was
as good or better than he had
anticipated because he never
felt the squad performed as well
as he had expected. However,
he felt that last weekend’s event
may prove a turning point for
next year as the club showed
they could outswim anybody,
even in an all-deep pool.

Next season, said the third-
year coach, up to six people
could step into the fast swimm-
ing Bernot’s shoes and the team
would lose very little. The
Generals’ 31 wins this season
was the most by any water polo
squad on the East Coast and set
the school record for most wins
in a season by any team in any
sport. Their fifth-place finish
was their best showing at the
Easterns, also.

“‘T am elated over the results
of our season,” said Remillard.
“But we think we can do better
next year.”

“T would rather be lucky than
good,’’ said Remillard. ‘‘This
year, we were good but we
weren’t lucky. Next year we
will try to be both good and
lucky.”’

tongue as she served up
thimble-fulls of carrot soup and
plates of salad which turned out
to be the main course. Rowan,
who fulminated for nearly 45
minutes on the dastardly deeds
of the Reagan administration,
was not without humor. Once,
he said, he received a letter
from a woman who said ‘‘Dear
Mr. Rowan: Life for you must
be a terrible burden considering
you’re black and stupid at the
same time.” Carl’s_ reply:
“Dear Ma’m: You are for-
tunate that life isn’t as big a
burden for you. Obviously you
only have half my problems.”

That afternoon after I
discovered a seminar on ethics
was too crowded to attend I
walked over to the Dirksen
building to sit in on Senate sub-
committee hearings on FOIA.
Sen. Orrin Hatch presided and
testimony was provided by
F.B.I. Director William
Webster.

At about 3 p.m. rumors began
spreading like wildfire that
David Stockman would resign
at a 4:30 news conference that
afternoon. Over in the Senate,
my next stop, I observed an ex-
change between Sen. Edward
Kennedy and an aide, who was
reading a xeroxed copy of the
Stockman admissions in the
current Atlantic Monthly. ‘I’m
just reading his garbage,”’ said
the smiling aide. ‘‘What do you,
uh, think he’ll say this after-
noon?’’ asked Kennedy.
“Probably ‘I support this great
government of ours and I’d like
to announce my candidacy for
the governor of Michigan,’ ”’
said the aide.

Ted didn’t mention it, but I
later read that he’d just come
from the White House where he
and mother Rose had met
privately with President and
Mrs. Reagan. He looked ruddy
and trimmer than he’s ap-
peared in a while.

There was a dance and party
at the National Press Club that
night with a band called The
Gents, who. played everything
from current Stones to Chic (La
Freak). Wine and beer flowed
prodigiously and dance floor
stints were alternated with
walks around the press club,
full of autographed pictures and
other items of interest. This
gathering broke up sometime
after 1 a.m.

I slept late the next morning,
choosing not to attend a session
which promised to induce tears
of real boredom anyway. I even
skipped a panel spoof called
‘Meet the Oppressed’ where
politicians and reporters swit-
ched roles and asked each other
ridiculous questions. Apparent-
ly most of the jokes centered
around Albert Hunt’s hair.

Actually, I had good reason to
skip the morning entertainment
as Washington and Lee’s own
Clark Mollenhoff was testifying
as an expert witness on ex-
ecutive privilege before a
House subcommittee. Even
though Peacock had given me
the wrong room number in the
Rayburn building, I found the
chamber in time to catch the
Boomer’s opening statement.
Digressing a few times from his
prepared text, Mollenhoff de-

nounced the use of the ‘‘per-
nicious doctrine”’ since the time _
of the Eisenhower administra-

After Clark and former sub-
committee chairman John
Moss began answering ques-
tions we left the hearing and
proceeded by congressional
subway to the Capitol, where I
went to the Senate in time to
catch some oratory by Jesse
Helms before a vote that would —
reduce funding for the Legal
Services Administration.
Senators began trickling to vote
and tete-a-tetes commenced:
Jackson and Warner, Weiker
and Kennedy, Laxalt and
Baker. The proposal, by
Alabama’s Jerimiah Denton,
was soundly defeated.

After another green lunch, I
skipped the speech, later being
assured I was wise to do so, and
took in the splendid Hyatt sur-
roundings before settling down
to read the paper. I made it
back down to catch a panel
discussion on _ investigative
reporting led by Clark
Mollenhoff (busy day for Uncle
Buckles). To any J-101, 102 or
323 student, the assembled
panel was a dream (or a
nightmare, depending on how
you look at it) come true as
reporters covered in lectures
and tests came to life: Pam
Zeckman and Bob Greene.

It was fun, it could have been
more so, it could have been
worse, but it really was infor-
mative. But aside from awful
food and an assigned roomate
from California who insisted on
locking himself in the bathroom
at regular intervals, it was an
enjoyable expreience.
