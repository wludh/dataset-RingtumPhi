A DIAMOND JUBILEE

by John Wells

Washington and Lee’s annual
Fancy Dress Weekend, still con-
sidered one of the country’s
premier college party week-
ends, rears its glittery head this
year on March 4, 5 and 6.

This year’s extravaganza is
marked by two distinctions: the
75th anniversary of the first af-
fair in 1907, and a move from
the Student Center to the
original site, Doremus Gym,
and the more spacious environs
of Warner Center.

This really isn’t the 75th Fan-
cy Dress — they nixed it during
World War II and for three
years in the decidedly radical
early 70s. But the Diamond
Jubilee is a good reason to get
excited, and it appears that the
SAB has spared no expense to
make the weekend a truly
memorable one.

An honest celebration of past
Fancy Dress Balls would re-
quire the expensive and uncom-
fortable custom of renting
elaborate costumes designed to
coincide with a gala theme.
Students can be grateful for the
comparative convenience of

black tie and the elegant gowns ;

of their dates. It is the ball itself f
that has come to define Fancy
Dress, and it is perhaps the last
remnant of Old East Coast col-
legia in existence, a touch of
class in a world of double knit
and designer jeans.

The Ball in recent years has
become chiefly notable for the
elaborate decorations executed
by busy SAB members. The
move to cavernous Warner
Center will understandably cut
down on some frills, but ex-
cellent lighting is expected to
help create a splendid, highly-
charged illusion.

The theme being Diamond
Jubilee, SAB officials have
strived to put together an even-
ing that will truly dazzle.

 

Mr. F.D. Arrives

 

Drawn to Warner Center by
the two glamorous searchlights
(which have prompted claims
of UFO sightings by local
residents), Mr. Fancy Dress
and his date will glide up the
steps to the modern Warner
facility. There they will glide
through the glassed-in hallway
on plush red carpet and be con-
fronted with so many alarming-
ly exciting choices of venue as
to induce frustrated euphoria.

So, before choosing, they may
gaze around the Entrance
Hallway, which will feature
‘The History of Fancy Dress.”
Through an array of posters,
anecdotes and reviews, the cou-
ple can pause to trace the
history of the Fancy Dress Ball
from the spartan effort of 1907
through three quarters of a cen-

 
 

thoroughly _ in-
formed, the F. D.’s may then

tury. Once

resume their dilemma of
deciding where to go.

The

 
 

 

 

Diamond Jubilee Ballroom

 

To their left, the ecstatic cou-
ple will find not Warner gym
but a fabulous Diamond Jubilee
Ballroom decorated with exotic
draperies, spectacular
backdrops and the afore-
mentioned Fab Lighting which,
according to the SAB press
release, will “transform the
basketball arena into a bona-
fide Celebration Hall.”

 

Lester Lanin

 

TICKETS

Tickets and memorabilia for
Fancy Dress ’82, ‘‘A Diamond
Jubilee,’’ will go on sale Mon.,
Mar. 1, one week after the W&L
undergraduate body has return-
ed from the Washington holi-
day.

Tickets for the Friday night
ball will cost $25. Tickets will
also be available at the door for
$30. Grain cups can be purchas-
ed at the rate of three for $1, and
Fancy Dress posters will be
available at the cost of $1
apiece.

some pretty awesome per-
formers — notably Benny Good-
man, Frank Sinatra, Count
Basie, Eddie Duchin, and his
son, Peter Duchin, who was
here just last year.

 

Champs d’ Elysee

 

 

 

Amid all this finery, classic
dance lovers will swoon to the
very high class strains of Lester
Lanin and his orchestra. Lanin
has made an excellent reputa-
tion on the debutante circuit
and it said to be a favorite of

First Partiers Ronnie and Nan-

cy. And he’s perfect for this
nostalgic occasion, having F.
D.’s upon a number of other
balls including the Golden
Jubilee back in the late 50s.
Lester has been preceded by

Hot rug-cutters may seek
refuge by sweeping up the
Ballroom steps into — not the
upstairs balcony, but — yes!
The famed Champs d’ Elysee du
Paris! The major tourist attrac-
tion and vital Parisian rue will
be reproduced to capture an
outdoors atmosphere with a
cafe, a real-life mime, a quick
sketch artist and a portraitist
from Andre Studio to capture
forever that special evening
that is Fancy Dress.

 

Themes of the Past

 

From.Gay Paris, Mr. and Mrs.

F. D. may venture into the next
special chamber — classrooms
done out in some of the finest F.
D. themes from the past (in
keeping with the retrospective
theme, you know). Step into
“Monte Carlo Night” (divine! )
and “The Roaring Twenties”
(boop-boop-a-doo! ). Tunes for
this fabulous arena will be pro-
vided by the Rock-n-Roll-
Rhythm-n-Blues sound of Eight
to the Bar. The SAB invites one
and all to “trip the life fan-
tastic, or try their luck at some
games of chance in its recrea-"
‘tion of a prohibition period
speak-easy.”’

 

Nostalgia Without Shame

 

After their fill of fun and
games the merry couple may -
once again stroll down les
Champs, glide through _ the
ballroom and check out the
other side of the Entrance
Hallway. There, in Doremus
Gym, where dear Miss Annie
held the first small-potatoes
masked ball in 1907 (an event to
be surpassed in_ historical
significance only by the fact
that Vice President Alben
Barkley succumbed there. in
1956) the couple can initially
soak up the nostalgia without
shame. Huge posters will bring
back memories of past Fancy
Dress Balls as will an ap-
propriately attired 1921 F. D.
couple along with earlier
themes, bands and decorations.

 

Beach and Soul

 

Nostalgia of another kind will

8 follow, although it is considered

standard contemporary W&L
frat entertainment — alter-
nating sets of Beach and Soul
(get off, Muffy!) by Chairmen
of the Board and the Voltage
Brothers. Dancers who do not
care to dip with Lester may
shag until they literally drop.

 

Midnight Surprise

 

Back amid the grandeur of
the main Ballroom, the evening
comes to a scintillating climax
when Lester unveils a surprise
guest at midnight and the ex-
hausted crowd can find new life
and extend its respective peaks
until the whole shootin’ match
shuts down (sometime in the

‘twee hours’’).

This single orgasmic night is
just one, albeit the biggest, of
several Fancy Dress events
that should leave all par-
ticipants numb with excitement
or burned out from too much
self-inflicted nirvana. But God
knows we all love it.

Other schools obviously don’t
know what they’re missing, it’s
almost here and after Wash-
ington Holiday...be ready.
 

 

Fancy Dress History |

Seventy-five-year-old Tradition

by Kip Gordon

Take an energetic librarian,
forty-seven dollars, a handful of
students in costume, and you
have all the main ingredients
for Washington and Lee’s first
Fancy Dress Ball in 1907.
Seventy-five years later the an-
nual event requires the talents
and efforts of 35 Student Ac-
tivities Board members, six
months of planning, a budget of
$55,000, and an expected turnout
of 4,000 people.

Miss Annie Jo White, a W&L
librarian, initiated the Fancy
Dress tradition when she threw
a costume party for a few of her
student friends, providing her
own initiative and the proceeds
from a theatrical production.
Aware of the possibilities for
social stimulus during the
doldrums of mid-winter, Miss
Annie set out to make her
February fete an annual affair.
Her efforts were at first greeted
with student indifference, but
her persistence paid off and her
masked ball soon gained the
support and enthusiasm of the
entire W&L community.

Each year Fancy Dress grew
in popularity and prestige. By
1919 its extravagance and
elaborate decorations were
famous throughout the South. In
1928 the affair received national
acclaim via The New York
Times, ‘Fancy Dress, the
South’s outstanding collegiate
social event.’’ By 1938 the Ball
had received coverage from
publications such as Life and
Look magazines.

 

Miss Annie Jo White

Some highlights of that era,
as reported by the 1979 Phi, in-
clude: Van Hern brings his
most elaborate costumes from
Philadelphia, Walter Winchell
introduces the Fancy Dress
Ball over radio in 1932 on the
Lucky Strike nationwide net-

ATA] work: hook up, Miss Annie Jo

continues to appear, and poses

biggest name bands are con-
tracted to play — Benny Good-
man, Eddie, Duchin, Kay
Kaiser, Duke Ellington, Count
Basie, Jimmy Dorsey...hun-
dreds of girls — from New
Orleans, Atlanta, Louisville,
Charleston,- Baltimore
—charter entire railroad cars to
come to Lexington.

The annual event has been in-
terrupted twice in its seventy-
five year history. It was discon-
tinued during the war years of
the early 1940’s, and abandoned
for a three-year period begin-
ning in 1971. As the New York
Times reported that year,

“LEXINGTON, VA. —
They’re screaming bloody
murder here because
Washington and Lee University
has given up its Fancy Dress
Ball...

“‘Perhaps (one student sigh-
ed) it can be resurrected.”’

Resurrection took place in
1974 with the newly formed
SAB’s version of Mardi Gras,
and the revitalized tradition has
been growing in strength ever
since. In the past seventy-five
years Fancy Dress has taken
W&L to places such as the Ken-
tucky Derby, Buckingham
Palace, the Emerald City of Oz,
Hollywood, Paris, Egypt, New
York, and most recently,

Broadway. This year’s Ball will
revisit some of these themes in
a tribute to seventy-five years
of an ongoing tradition.

aaa Lanin——

This year, the SAB has
selected the Lester Lanin band
for the Fancy Dress Ball as the
headline act. This world
renowned band will appear in
Warner Center from 8:30 to
12:30 a.m. on Friday, March 5.

Lanin’s music has_ been
described as ‘‘the beat heard
round the world.”’ Indeed, in its
over 30 years, Lanin’s band has
appeared before every Presi-

. dent from Truman to Reagan at

inaugural balls and other
special occasions.

Lanin is a favorite of the
British Royal Family, and was
once given the Royal salute by
the Queen Mother. Other world
officials have sought Lanin for
their banquets and debutante
balls.

A factor enhancing Lanin’s
popularity is his practice of
varying his program to suit any
occasion. This means that the
Royal Family might hear sets
of continuous music suited to

 

 

their tastes, while the slightly
less dignified guests at the Fan-
cy Dress Ball might get, shall
we say, a program suited for
just about anything.

In 1956, realizing the rising in-
fluence of rock music, Lanin ad-
ded guitars to his Big Band
sound. A move which proved
unheard of by other musicians.

Lanin was born into a musical
family in Philadelphia. His
father, founder of the first In-
ternational Orchestra, gave
Lanin much of his philosophy of
music, urging him to develop a
style that was “distinctive and
recognizable.”’

His recordings include “Les
at the Tiffany Ball,’”’ which was
recorded in 1959 at the Vander-
bilt estate in Newport.

The Lester Lanin Band will
appear throughout the evening
in the ‘‘Waldorf Astoria
Ballroom’”’ at the Fancy Dress
Ball. The Band’s cosmopolitan
flair should create the perfect
mood for this year’s Diamond
Jubilee theme.

Eight to the Bar

Swing, swing, swing

It’s an unlikely scene: A
seven-piece swing band playing
’30s and ’40s music with such
skill and abandon that
members of the audience are
compelled to leave their seats
and jitterbug.

Unlikely, yes. Fictional, no.

The era of swing is being
revived by a band called Eight
to the Bar. The group has
become so popular that it can
fill a nightclub on the slowest
Sunday night.

Eight to the Bar is evidently
on to something — young people

‘will still gravitate to the swing
sound of yesteryear.

‘‘We’re having a great deal of
success right now,” said Bar-
bara Lyon, one of the leaders of
the group. ‘We play clubs, col-
leges, and dances, and it seems
like the places are filled every
time out.

“The band used to play coun-
try swing music, but in the past
few years we’ve moved to
swing. We do other music, too,
yet the crowds seem to really
like the older tunes.

Eight to the Bar will perform
in the Monte Carlo — roaring
20s area during Fancy Dress
Ball.

‘‘Swing is coming back. When
people are exposed to it, they
love it.” ,

Eight to the Bar is based in
New Haven, Conn. Its name is a
reference to the fact that much
of the boogie-woogie style is
based on musical combinations
of eight bars.

In addition, for much of its
six-year life, the group had
eight members.

Its first visit to Portland was
an engagement three years ago
at Bottoms Up and those early
appearances were winners.

The band now plays a half
dozen venues in southern
Maine, and the result is
generally the same: Once the
community hears about the
band, the seats are taken.

Their selections include such
nostalgic classics as ‘‘Boogie
Woogie Bugle Boy,” ‘‘Chat-
tanooga Choo-Choo,”’ ‘‘Take the
A Train,” and ‘‘In the Mood.”

Many bands could probably
play such fare, but few are
capable of such flair, such
authenticity.

Other songs worked in are

“South Street,”’ “Don’t Let Go” -

and a handful of originals.

Barbara Lyon, a_ striking
brunette, and Polly Messer, an
attractive blonde, are showcas-
ed on vocals. They play their
roles as if from another era, and
at times bring back the sound of
the Andrews Sisters.

Cynthia Lyon is on key-
boards, and also contributes
vocals.

Probably the most forceful of
the musicians is Paul Nigro on

of bringing out the hordes while
swing entices a smaller, albeit,
more select group of spectators.
Yet Eight to the Bar is op-
timistic that there is a niche for
them on the national level.
‘We'd like to have the kind of
success of a group like Manhat-

-tan Transfer,”’ said Barbara

Lyon, who with sister Cynthia

who does not read music, yet he
plays with a verve and con-
fidence that seems to move the
whole band.

Mark Powell on bass, Gary
Stevens on drums, and guitarist
Bruce Springsteen, round out a
crew that is unique in this area.

All members add theatrics to
their performances, emulating
(with some humor) the perfor-
ming styles of five decades ago.

The popularity of the group is
limited in scope, in the sense
that hard rock ‘n’ roll is capable

quite well. In addition to club
and concert dates, we’ve been
chosen to entertain at Har-
vard’s Hasty Pudding awards
this year, and we’ll have an
album coming out this spring.

where we are, but I’d also say
we’re helped by the fact that
many people want to hear the
whole swing sound come back

BILLY PRICE
Soulful P-burg Singer
Hits the Big Time

Billy Price isn’t the most successful musician in Pittsburgh. He’s
not the highest paid. He doesn’t sell the most records. But folks,
there have been some damned bright lights reflected off those dark
glasses of his. In fact, it was only a few years ago that he was tour-
ing the U.S. and Canada, singing in the most prestigious halls.

The Cockpit is among those halls, and Price will appear there
Tuesday night of Fancy Dress week. :

The lights aren’t quite that bright these days. Billy Price and the
Keystone Rhythm Band is a popular act in Pittsburgh and a few
other places, but it’s extremely doubtful they could get booked at
the Stanley Theatre, let alone Carnegie Hall, where Price once
sang.

But the dimmer lights don’t seem to bother Billy Price. He’s
already had a taste of success. Maybe ‘‘dose”’ is a better word
because, you see, rather than a stairway that spiraled upward, suc-
cess for Billy Price became a ceiling that kept getting lower;
rather than an open sky filled with possibility, it turned out to be a
floor drain that sucked away his energy, creativity and confidence

- until finally, in a fit of desperation, he grabbed that hot spot light of

success, ripped it out, smashed it to pieces and silently walked
away.

Billy Price (nee: William Pollak) grew up outside Paterson, New
Jersey. Unlike his idols — people like Otis Redding, Bobby ‘“‘Blue”’
Biand, and James Brown — Billy can’t tell stories about picking
cotton or washing diner dishes as a child. He grew up ina nice, lily-
white suburb, the son of a prominent dentist and a housewife.

He always enjoyed listening to music, but rather than listening to
the latest pop hits by the Four Seasons, The Beatles, or the Beach
Boys, this young white kid was keeping his transistor tuned to the
black stations out of Newark and New York City. He stayed up late
at night waiting to hear what was being played in faraway places
like Memphis and Detroit. That rhythm-and-blues music came
through those tiny speakers, poured into his ears and trickled down
inside where it dropped some strong, deep roots.

As a teenager, he began sneaking off to New York City with a few
of his. older brother’s friends. He could get served in some of the
bars there. He could also see some of the bands and singers he had
been listening to at home. Like so many other guys during the six-
ties who couldn’t swing a baseball bat and didn’t know a down-and-
out from an up, up and away, Billy began dreaming of being a musi-
cian. It was a way to be popular. It was a way to meet girls. It was a
way to be somebody.

By ninth grade, he had learned many of the moves of those
smooth Motown singers. He got himself a gold satin shirt, some
green pin striped pants and a pair of pointed shoes. He also found
some guys who could play and didn’t mind dressing alike and form-
ed a band called ‘‘Billy and the Uptights.”” He was a showman from
the beginning.

In front of spotlights more suited for aluminum Christmas trees,
he did, among other things, an imitation of James Brown’s famous
“cape routine.” In that part of his act, Brown became so involved
with his performance that he seemed on the verge of losing control,
blowing a gasket, or suffering a stroke. But just in the nick of time,
two men would come out on stage, calm him down, wrap a cape
around him, and lead him away.

James Brown did it on national television. Billy Price did it at the
YMCA.

In high school, he sang and danced his way through a barrage of
homecomings and sock hops. When he went off to Penn State in the
late sixties, he began turning his microphone on at beer bashes and
frat parties. But Price didn’t go to college to study rock-and-roll,
rhythm-and-blues, or Ravel and Bach, for that matter. He hadn’t
considered making music his career. Price was in college to get his
English degree and become a man of letters.

But a few things popped up along the way that threatened to
change things, such as LSD and Buddhism. In fact, this sweating
soul singer went so far as to change his college major to religious
studies and plan a pilgrimage to China. Before he could do that,
though, that part of his brain where all the music played began to
heat up. In the bars around State College, he met other musicians
who had the same problem. They could only calm those strange
palpitations by getting together with their saxophones, guitars and
voices. When that happened, those brain waves started flowing to
the same rhythm, and it was a damned funky one at that. They
became the Rhythm Kings.

Doremus Gym: Beach and Soul Music

The key word in understan-
ding the VOLTAGE BROTH-
ERS is community. This
remarkable group of young
men. from the ghetto of
Rochester forms a community,
that transcends even their
spirited and varied music. And
a key to understanding this
community is their director-
mentor, Jerry Griffin.

Griffin, a former Marine
riflery instructor who
discovered that he _ liked

teaching young people, became
involved with the group when it
was a teenage band called
FUNKY HEAVY in Rochester
in the late ’60’s. He found them
because of his work with com-.
munity organizations. He is a
rabid supporter of self-help pro-
grams and that is what this
band has become — an attempt
at forming a unit that would
band together to rise above
societal problems. After much
travail, the VOLTAGE BROTH-
ERS succeeded. 3

The VOLTAGE BROTHERS
have been together as a band
for more than ten years. A
thirteen-man family, they in-
clude a horn section, rhythm
section, ten powerful voices,
and three equipment/sound
men. They have toured exten-
sively throughout the country
and now call Atlanta their
home.

‘he 1976 Producer Jerry Ross
heard the group and was so im-’
pressed by their talent and
energy that he brought them to
Lifesong Records where they
signed a major recording deal.

And Lifesong, insisting that
the group be represented by the
most professional management
possible, persuaded Sid
Seindenberg, President of SAS,
Inc. who hadn’t signed a group
to his management firm in two
years, to listen to the VOLT-
AGE BROTHERS. Once he and
his staff heard the group, it was
an instant marriage and the
VOLTAGE BROTHERS joined
Gladys Knight and the Pips,
B.B. King, and Gene McDaniels
on the SAS roster.

It is a tribute to the ten musi-
cians who are the VOLTAGE
BROTHERS that they have
come this far as a unit. Where
they are bound is stardom and
soon the VOLTAGE BROTH-
ERS family will be extended to
include an_ enthusiastic
worldwide audience.

Chairmen of the Board

No group creates excitement
like the Chairmen of the
Board. Their avid fans regular-
ly make road trips to ex-
perience the ‘“‘Electricity’’ of
“The Chairmen.”

From the first inkling that the
“Chairmen” are on their way to
the stage, the audience stands
in anxious anticipation to greet
them. The “Chairmen” have
such a command over an au-
dience that while some groups
have to ask the audience to sing
along, the “Chairmen” just
have to stop while the fans
carry on.

It all began for General Nor-
man Johnson, like so many
others before him, in the chur-
ch. At six years of age, General
Johnson began singing with his
father and gained experience in
the choir.

At the tender age of 12,
General Johnson gathered his
neighborhood buddies and
formed a group called the
‘‘Humdingers.”’ As far as fame
and fortune are concerned, they
may have not turned out to be
‘“‘Humdingers,” in the slang
definition sense of the word,
even though they recorded with
Atlantic Records. Nothing was
ever released.

During his last year of high
school, General Johnson
gathered Norfolk, VA buddies
once again — this time the
group’s name was the
“Showmen.”’ A recording con-
tract this time with Minit
Records produced five singles.
It was the first release, ‘‘It Will
Stand,’’ that has become an an-
them with beach music fans like
Danny & The Juniors’ ‘Rock &
Roll Is Here To Stay”’ has with
oldie fans. In an interview with
General Johnson, he said that
he did not know of the shag
when he wrote the line that
says, “‘little dances that look so

neat, you see why it will stand,”’
even though a Bop type dance
was prevalent in the Norfolk
area as he grew up. “It Will
Stand” has also been adopted as
the title of the only magazine
dedicated to the preservation of
Beach Music, published in
Charlotte, NC.

The Showmen’s last release
for Minit, another General
Johnson penned tune has
stirred up a controversy over
the title ‘‘39-21-46’’ as listed on
the record label. The song was

originally _— to be

 

€)
gore ae
&

“You Are So
ended up
**39-91-46’’ because the record

released as
Beautiful’’ and
producer felt it was more
‘‘marketable.”’

The Showmen moved from
Minit Records to Swan Records
for a short time, releasing three
discs, then Airerecords, Ins-
tant, and also recording for
Jokers 3 Productions of
Greensboro, NC, in 1967.

In 1968, General Johnson
began negotiations with Invic-
tus Records and producers
Holland, Dozier, Holland. In

1969, the Chairmen of the Board
were born. Even though
General Johnson was no longer
one of the ‘‘Showmen,”’ he was
definitely a ‘‘SHOWman.”
Another ‘SHOWman” became
an integral part of the
Chairmen of The Board, Danny
Woods. Other members were
Eddie Custis and Harrison Ken-
nedy.

The road has kept the
“Chairmen’’ very busy for the
last few years, but not enough to
keep them from releasing
gigantic southeastern beach

 

classics such as ‘On The
Beach,’ ‘Pretty Women
Everywhere (Hey Baby),”’
“Carolina Girls,” and more.
The Chairmen of The Board
take control of an audience like
an executive bringing a board
meeting to order with a 20 lb.
gavel. To see the Chairmen of
The Board is a treat. To have
not ever experienced the excite-
ment and the electricity of the
Chairmen of The Board, is like
not ever having a hot dog all-
the-way or an extra slice of
mom's apple pie on Sunday.

BEFORE........
ARS Thursday Night

Atlanta Rhythm Section will
perform in Cameron Hall at
VMI as part of W&L’s Fancy
Dress Weekend. Tickets for the
March 4 show will cost $3 for
W&L students.

There is something very
familiar and reassuring in the
sound of Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion holding forth across the air-
waves year after year, a consis-
tent output that few groups
—Northern, Southern, British,
you name it — are able to
match. It is hard to recall a mo-
ment during the last four years
when ARS wasn’t keeping its
hybrid brand of rock ’n roll at
the very top of the charts, star-
ting with 1977’s ‘‘So In to You,”’
then the following year with
“Imaginary Lover” and “I’m
Not Gonna Let It Bother Me
Tonight,” and yet again with
“Do It or Die” and their remake
of ‘‘Spooky”’ in ’79.

There are always those folks
who'd argue that any group
with the collective strengths of
ARS couldn’t possibly lose: the
individual talents of each musi-
cian in the band, all quiet
veterans of the studio session
wars long before they’d got
together in the band; the
awesome songwriting abilities
of the band members collabor-
ating with their producer-
manager Buddy Buie through
the years; and the full-time use
of one of the finest recording
facilities in the country
—Doraville, Georgia’s Studio
One — manned by associate
producer-engineer Rodney

Mills, long since named ‘‘one of
rock ’n roll’s great natural
resources”’ by ARS.

Those all-too-humanh
strengths (tempered by a
righteous bit of Southern soul)

are a QUINELLA you can bet .

your hard-earned money on, as
the title of their lucky 11th
album suggests. The Atlanta
Rhythm Section joins Columbia
Records in 1981 with an LP that
more than does justice ot the
classic ARS sounds of the past,
from the very first single to
jump off side one, ‘Alien.’

Not only can you sense the
resolutin of so many dues-
paying years as this musical
QUINELLA Plays its hand, but
there’s also a strong feeling for
the future in terms of staying
true to that past. ARS fans are
always reminded of a summer
September three years ago,
with ‘Imaginary Lover”’ as the
season’s theme song, when the
band returned home to Atlanta
after a hot tour. They were
greeted in the city streets like
heroes, and played in front of
60,000 people that day at the
Campagne Jam Festival in
Grant Field, headlinging over
Santana, Eddie Money, and the
Doobie Brothers. The same
month, September 25th it was,
Chip Carter brought them to the
White House where family and
friends came to hear them. ‘I
think I have a lot in common
with the Atlanta Rhythm Sec-
tion,’’ the President said that
afternoon.

veces AFTER
Offenders at Zollman’s

Bruce Olsen and his band are
posing real problems for enter-
tainment editors and concert
reviewers alike. No one knows
exactly how to label the band’s
sound. The writers compare
them to David Bowie and the
Stones, but the terms of com-
parison are always ‘‘almost’’ or
“somewhat” and never quite
definite.

Take the facts. The band
sports the name Bruce Olsen
and The Offenders. Their play
list heavily patronizes the early
Stones, Elvis Costello and The
Talking Heads. And the band’s
four members boast the aliases
Bruce Ogre, Chris Stink, Com-
mander, and Rick Gruesome.
Put the data together. With un-
doubtedly punkish names, a
playlist full of New Wave and a
group title along the line of The
Heartbreakers or The Attrac-
tions, you think you’ve got them
pegged alright.

Wrong. Make way for ‘‘Jock
rock,’’ a name Olsen himself
labeled The Offenders’ music.
His reviewers always include
the unusual term, but to clear
things up for readers, the sound

is good old rock and roll. To
quote a Florida reviewer, ‘‘it’s
full of punk, power and pizazz.”’

Put that on the data card. And
add to it a Bowieish stage show
featuring the 6’5” lead guitarist
and vocalist, Olsen, dominating
the floor with a stage presence
that has been likened to the
wildly mobile, gesticulatory,
growing performance of Jagger
— a combination that Olsen
picked up through past ex-
perience and one that he says
has been especially appealing
to the same constituency
Springsteen directs his music
to.

The reviewers might be
sweating it out over the choice
of terms but Bruce Olsen and
The Offenders just get down to
doing what they do best. Having
just finished a stint in New York
and now before heading down
South for an extended tour, the
band will be playing here in
Charlottesville Thursday night
at Poe’s.

“Jock rock.’’ You won’t find it
in the dictionary. Come try to
define it from the dance floor.
