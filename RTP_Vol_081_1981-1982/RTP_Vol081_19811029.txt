EC,IFC Clash Over Contact Funding |!

by Ed Gonsalves

The Interfraternity Council
refused a challenge by the Ex-
ecutive Committee Tuesday
night to contribute $9000 to Con-
tact, an increase of almost 100
percent over last year’s IFC ap-
propriation.

The Executive Committee,
reporting that: Contact is the
strongest committee system on
campus because of the speakers
it provides for students and
Lexington residents, issued the
challenge to Mike Drinkwater

and Robert McLean, Contact
co-chairmen.

According to Drinkwater, the
E.C. would have added $1000 to
its original Contact appropria-
tion of $10,000 if the IFC would
have increased their appropria-
tion $1500, from $7500 to $9000.

Contact, established in 1962
by the IFC as a gesture of good-
will to the City of Lexington, is
financed in part through appro-

_ priations from the E.C. and an

IFC assessment of fraternity
members.

Ballengee New Rector
Of Board Of Trustees

James M. Ballengee, a
leading Philadelphia business
executive, was elected rector of
Washington & Lee University’s
board of trustees during the
board meeting held on campus
last weekend.

Ballengee succeeds E. Mar-

shall Nuckols Jr., former senior .

vice president of Campbell Soup
Company, who retired from the
board. The position of rector is
the equivalent of chairman of
the board.

Two other members of the
W&L board — Mrs. James

Tuscaloosa, Ala. — also retired
and were honored during the
trustees’ meeting. Nuckols was
designated rector emeritus
while Mrs. Martin and Warner
became trustees emeriti.

Ballengee, the new rector, is
president and chairman of the
Enterra Corporation, a holding
company with 10 subsidiaries
and headquarters in Radnor,
Pa. A trustee of Washington &
Lee since 1978, he is a 1948 W&L
law graduate.

A native of Charleston,
W.Va., Ballengee practiced law
in his hometown for nine years
following his graduation from
W&L. In 1957, he became
associate counsel of Sears,
Roebuck & Company. He was
named general attorney and
assistant secretary of Sears,
Roebuck & Company in 1961 but

(continued on page 8)

The IFC agreed by a vote of
15-2 to increase its contribution
from last year’s fee of $4650 to

$7500. This money will be raised —
. by assessing each fraternity

member $9.05 (the total amount
of fraternity members divided
by $7500).

Each fraternity will pay a
sum equal to the number of its
members multiplied by the
$9.05 (e.g. a house with a
membership of 50 will be billed
$452.50, an increase of $200
more than last year).

' ‘The $10,000 that the Executive
Committee agreed to appro-
priate is raised through a stu-
dent activity fee levied at the
beginning of each year. This
amounts to double-taxation on

The Tables Are Turned,
The Hazing

Pledges Do

by Todd Smith

Fraternity kidnapping this
fall seems to be practiced less
on the freshman pledges than
by them.

Freshmen have abducted at
least three upperclassmen so
far from Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Chi.

Ted McQuiston, a sophomore
Pi Phi, was kidnapped by
freshman pledges Sunday, Oct.
18.

A nurse working the 4-12 shift
at the Student Health Center in
the basement of Davis Dor-
mitory found McQuiston in a
closet.

The closet adjoined a public

hallway where the cage door
was usually left open with an
unlocked padlock on it. The next
morning a custodian found a
sign, ‘‘Do not feed the
animals,”’ on the cage door.

MeQuiston had been in the
closet two to three hours when
nurse Clara Wilhoit found him
blindfolded and tightly bound at
the hands with an army belt.
According to nurses, he was
stunned and close to shock.

Bringing lemonade to calm
him down, Wilhoit had the juice
knocked out of her hands by
freshmen, who then carried Mc-
Quiston off again.

' Squad Car Crash Still A Mystery

by David Ridlon

The Lexington Police Depart-
ment is still investigating how
one of its patrol cars mys-
teriously moved and hit a brick
wall Oct. 3.

Patrolman Torben Pedersen,
who was investigating the
Sigma Nu fraternity house at 4
Henry St. in Lexington when the
incident occurred, said the
police department suspects a
Washington & Lee University
student is responsible for the
mishap.

Pedersen was investigating
‘Sigma Nu for a noise violation.
He said he left his patrol car
unlocked in front of the fraterni-
ty, putting the car in park and
removing the keys from the ig-
nition. The policeman said he
went into the fraternity to close
down a band and when he
returned five minutes later he
found his car smashed against

the war memorial at the en-
trance of Washington & Lee
University.

Pedersen said _ several
students have come forward

 

THE POLICE
CAR CAPER

/

  
    

 

saying they saw a student get
into the car and shift the patrol
car out of park. Pedersen said
none of them could identify the
student, however, they said he

was dressed in a
uniform.” ~~

The patrolman added the
mishap was also the result of a
mechanical failure in the
transmission of the car. Accor-
ding to him the car cannot be
shifted out of park unless the
key is in the ignition.

Pedersen said the police
department asked the universi-
ty to put all fraternities on
social probation until the
suspect came forward and cgn-

fessed. The university ad-
ministration refused to do so.

Pedersen said the person
responsible will be charged
with intentionally setting a
motor vehicle in motion and
destruction of public property.
He added the police department
will also pursue the case in civil
court to make the responsible
party pay for the damages.

Officer Investigated In
1977 Hop-In Theft

by David Ridlon

A Lexington police officer has
been suspended from duty pen-
ding an investigation into possi-
ble misconduct.

Officer Barry Flynt was
suspended from duty Wednes-
day morning as a result of an in-
ternal investigation by Lex-
ington Police Chief James Kir-
by. Kirby has called in the
Virginia State Police to conduct
their own investigation of the in-
cident.

The investigation centers
around the theft of $500 from the
Hop-In Food Store on North
Main Street in Lexington. The
theft occurred in June 1977 but
Kirby said he had just learned
about the theft last week when a
reporter from WDBJ, Channel-
Seven in Roanoke, called for
some information regarding the
incident.

Kirby said Flynt was
suspended in lieu of possible
“conduct unbecoming of a
police officer.’’ Kirby would not
comment further on the inci-
dent.

The Lexington Police Depart-
ment is waiting for the State
Police to finish its investigation
before conducting a personnel
hearing. In the personnel hear-
ing Chief Kirby will choose one
person to sjt on the review panel
and Officer Flynt will be allow-
ed to choose another person to
sit on the panel. These two
panel members will then choose
a third to sit with them, and
they will review the case. The
hearing is' expected to begin
within the next couple of weeks.

Flynt joined the Lexington
Police Department March 1,
1973.

 

 

Plaque Commemorating Academy

To Be Dedicated Saturday At Chi Psi

A plaque commemorating the
Ann Smith Academy, the Se-
cond oldest incorporated school
for girls in Virginia, will be for-
mally dedicated in ceremonies
at 11 a.m. Saturday on the steps
of ‘the building standing on
original school property now oc-
cupied by W&L’s chapter of Chi
Psi fraternity.

The plaque has been donated

by the local chapter of the
Association for the Preserva-
tion of Virginia Antiquities. Ac-'
cording to Mrs. Fred Hadsel,
president of the local APVA
chapter, the plaque is designed
“to keep before the public the
historic significance of this
building.’’
‘ The: original Ann Smith
Academy building was erected
by:a local board of trustees in
1808-09 on its present site at the
corner of Nelson Street and'Lee
Avenue.

Flood Honored Tomorrow

by B. Scott Tilley

Tomorrow from 4:00 until
5:30 p.m., Charles Flood will be
honored at a reception and
autograph party in the Univer-
sity Bookstore. The reception
will coincide with the publica-
tion of his book, ‘‘Lee: The Last
Years.”

The book deals with the five
years of Lee’s life after his sur-
render at Appomattox. This
time period includes his
presidency of Washington Col-
lege (now Washington and
Lee), and his role as prime
healer of bitterness between
North and South after the Civil
War.

Flood, whose book, ‘‘Rise,
and Fight Again’ won the
American Revolution Round
Table Award for the best book
on the Revolution published
during the Bicentennial year,
researched much of his book at
W&L and in the Lexington area.
“The Lee Papers” in the W&L
library contained much infor-
mation that has never been
published before. ‘‘They are
very valuable, THE source for
information on Lee’s last
years,” Flood said.

Flood also noted the impor-
tance of aid he received from
many individuals affiliated with
W&L. In particular, he ex-
pressed appreciation to Betty
Kondayan and Susan Koblantz
in the library, Professors Mer-
chant and Doyon, and Mary
Coulling. ‘“‘They were extreme-
ly helpful, far beyond what a
researcher could aa ” he
explained.

Flood felt that; his book
“covers Lee’s last five years
more extensively than any
biographer has covered it
before. No one has previously

 

, The last portrait of Lee during his lifetime. \

concluded how important his
contribution* was in rebuilding
the union. Ninety- -five percent
of all Americans believe Lee
vanished after Appomattox.”

It was this same lack of
knowledge that led Flood to
write the book. ‘Actually, I
would seem to be one of the
most unlikely; candidates to
write a book like this,’’ he ex-
plained. ‘‘My great-grandfather
was a Union Cavalry Sergeant
who was captured and held in
Andersonbille Prison. I was
born in Manhatten and lived in
the North until 6 years ago.”’

Flood’s book contains es
viously unpublished informa-
aoe cerning Lee’s attempts

bout Lee and his horse,
Teode and the founding of
Kappa Alpha fraternity. Among
other ‘novel material is a
touching letter from a former.

Civil War soldier who had lqst ©
an arm in the war asking Leé

about admission and tuition at
Washington College.

Autographed copies of “Lee:
The; Last Years’ will | be
available in the bookstore dur-
ing the reception for $14.95.

The former Anne Smith Academy, which is currently occupied by
Chi Psi fraternity, will be the site of a dedication ceremony on
Saturday.

In 1903, it was leased to the
town for a public school. When

the town: took charge, the
building was _ judged not to be
safe and wasiazed. The present

structure. was erected by the
town of’ on in 1909 and
was used as ..4 : public school
building. he

Abandonéd,,as a_ school
building in 1970, Washington
and Lee purchased the building
from the city in 1978 and
renovated it, maintaining the
exterior appearance to a max-
imum extent:

Taking part in the plaque
dedication will be Dr. George
Ray, professor of English at
Washington and Lee and faculty
adviser to the Chi Psi fraterni-
ty; Edward Gonsalves, W&L
senior and president of Chi Psi;
Henry Ravenhorst, professor of
engineering at W&L and the ar-
chitect in charge of the

building’s renovation; Mrs.
Hadsel of the APVA; and, Dr.
William W. Pusey III, dean
emeritus at W&L and a member
of the APVA.

The plaque will incorporate
text commemorating the entire
history of the building with an
illustration of the original
building. Immediately follow-
ing the ceremony the Chi Psi
house will be open for a tour of
what Mrs. Hadsel characterizes
as “‘an excellent example of a
renovated building being put to
a new purpose.”’

Mrs. Hadsel indicated that
Dr. Pusey was instrumental in
the APVA’s decision to erect a
plaque. ‘‘Dr. Pusey’s talk on the
Ann Smith Academy at an AP-
VA meeting is what spurred our
interest in the building,” she
said.

Foreign Students Find
Less Pressure At W&L

by Steve Warren

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity is ‘not gas competitive as
universitet Hong Kong and
Singaporé, ‘it*' the” students
here are more self-motivated
than they arg-abr qd; according
to foreign stydeats at W&L.

Seng Kah “Henry” Baey, a
regular student here, is from
Singapore. He says that the
main difference in competition
among universities is in the ex-
amination process. For W&L,
and other American colleges,
exams are held after each sem-
ester and the student’s ner-
vousness ends there. At univer-
sities in Singapore, a student
can expect to take a cumulative
exam at the end of each year-
long course. ‘There is intense
pressure on those,’’ Henry said.

Ping Wah ‘‘Feva”’ Lai, an ex-
change student from Hong
Kong, adds that there are also
competetive exams at each
level of entrance, such as col-
lege entrance and college
graduation exams. While
students here may complete a
degree by passing all required
courses, students at the two

universities in Hong Kong must

pass an additional exam before
they can graduate. This final:
examination can also be
cumulative.

How do these students find
Washington and Lee, in terms
of academics?

“There is more individual
motivation of students,’’ says
Feva. “‘That’s not to say the
students in Hong Kong are not;
it’s just that, here at W&L,
students-take education not just
for examinations. In Hong
Kong, the education ideology is
‘Education for those selected...’
because there are only two
universities there.”’

How do these students like the
all-male environment?

“I don’t like it,” said Henry.
“There is tremendous pressure
on the weekends, after studying
hard all week. Girls are looked
on for sex, or physical plea-
sures, rather than just as
friends, like you would call
someone up and say ‘How are
you...do you want to go out for a
mas *

As for Feva, he isn’t bothered
by it. He says that there are
enough Christian students here
to do things with.

A ‘Conflagration’ Presentation

by Carren O. Kaston

The wide-screen movie
Conflagration (Enjo), fourth in
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s Japanese Film Series, is
scheduled for Monday,
November 2, at 8 p.m. In a
departure from the customary
screening location for the
series, Conflagration will,
because of the width of the
print, be shown in duPont Hall.
The showing is free of charge
and open to the public.

Conflagration (96 minutes),
made in Japan in 1958, is the se-
cond film in the series to be
directed by Kon Ichikawa. (The
first was The Heart, made in
1955). Ichikawa’s movie is bas-
ed on Yukio Mishima’s 1956
novel Kinkakuji (The Temple of
the Golden Pavilion), which
concerns the true story of a
young Zen Buddhist acolyte
who in 1950 burned down the ex-
quisite, world-famous medieval
Zen temple in Kyoto called The
Golden Pavilion. Drawn to acts
of destruction, Mishima himself
committed suicide in 1972.

‘Mach One’

Here
Sunday

The United States Air Force
Rock Band Mach One will per-
form in Cameron Hall at the
Virginia Military Institute at 3
p.m. Sunday. The afternoon ap-
pearance is sponsored by VMI
and the Arnold Air Society, the
Air Force ROTC student club.
The performance is free of
charge, and the public is in-
vited.

Mach One is composed of five
professional musicians, all
members of the parent organ-
ization, the U.S. Air Force
Band. The program will consist
of popular rock tunes, including
some of the group’s arrange-
ments. It is led by Sergeant Ken
Buckery, USAF.

The appearance of Mach One
will be the first public use of the
new multi-purpose facility at
VMI. The concert preceeds by
one week the formal dedication
of the building on Nov. 6and7.

(For area radio stations: the
USAF Band will provide upon
request free Mach One LP
albums for Promotional Give-
aways to publicize the concert.
Contact Captain B. J. Stephen-
son, Jr., USAF, AFROTC, VMI,
463-6354. )

Both Mishima’s novel and
Ichikawa’s film explore the
character of a man impelled to
destroy what he most loves. He
is motivated by a desire to
purify the Pavilion of the
desecration of its use after
World War IL as a tourist attrac-
tion.

The pyromaniacal young man
may also be rebelling against
the forms and disciplines of the
Zen Buddhist way of life, which
has for generations laid its spell
on a whole range of national
behavior and culture, from
social etiquette to swordsman-
ship and judo, from theater
techniques to flower ar-
rangements, from garden
designs to archery, from the
formal tea ceremony to literary
styles and conventions.

But the young priest is also an
inveterate stutterer, an obsess-
ed son of tormenting parents.

Ichikawa’s film, an example of
the sub-genre known as the
‘home drama,”’ focuses on the
relationship between the young
man’s devastating family life
and his fanatical idealism. The
movie’s creative use of the wide
screen reinforces its textured
visual beauty and its striking

use of architecture.
The fifth and last movie in the
series will be Hiroshi

Teshigahara’s widely acclaim-
ed Woman in the Dunes (1964),
scheduled for November 9 at 8
p.m. inclassroom “‘A”’ of Lewis
Hall. The Japanese Film Series
is sponsored by the East Asian
Studies Program of Washington
and Lee. The films are made
available through the generosi-
ty of the Japan Foundation, and
are being shown here in con-
junction with the W&L course
‘Japanese Literature in
Translation.”

Film Notes

Trouble in Paradise (1932) A sophisticated comedy directed by
Ernst Lubis8tch, and his touch was never more apparent in this
story of jewel thieves and romance abroad. Featuring some of the
most elegant stars of the period, Herbert Marshall, Miriam
Hopkins and Kay Francis, gliding through a series of glittery sets.
It is difficult for modern audiences to understand Kay Francis’s
total personification of glamour in the immediate post-silent era. A
treat. Shown by the journalism department Tuesday evening at 7
and 9 p.m. in Reid Hall. Admission, of course, is free.

‘Mommie Dearest’,Or, A Woman’s Fayce

by John Wells

JOAN CRAWFORD’s name appears on the mar-
quee of the State Theater this week as it did fre-
quently from 1930 to 1960 and probably never will
again. For the first time, Crawford is the subject,
not the star, and this is clearly not a film bio in the
tradition of The Jolson Story.

Crawford’s death in 1977 made the front pages,
the loss of the ultimate movie queen. Her years as
a major box office attraction, from 1928 to 1956, re-
main unchallenged; she won her Academy Award
in 1945, years after most of her contemporaries —
Clara Bow, Norma Shearer and Greta Garbo —
had vanished permanently from the screen. The
fact of her durability is even more astounding
when one considers that all but a handful of her
movies were mediocre at best.

One month after Crawford’s death, the terms of
her will were announced. In it, she left nothing to
adopted children Christina and Christopher, ‘‘for
reasons well known to them.”

Hell hath no fury like a brat cut off.

Within two years, ‘‘Mommie Dearest”’ hit the
bookstands, filling Christina’s coffers with more
money than Crawford earned during her heyday.
To say the book is sensational is a gross
understatement. No one bothered to point out that
it was written by a disinherited, vindictive
daughter about a woman obviously unable to de-
fend herself, and that the gruesomest portions
could be attested to only by one or the other. The

tales were accepted as blind truth by a voracious -
public apparently enthralled at pulling down idols .''

for a good wallow in the mud.

After about a year on the tacky talk show cir-
cuit, Christina thankfully disappeared from public
view. Now Mommie Dearest is a top grossing
movie, and the whole sordid mess has once again
been thrust upon us.

Faye Dunaway has been made up to really look
like Crawford in still photographs. For all the
grease, though, the moving image is marred by a
flat face and a nose that isn’t quite right.
Crawford’s huge, luminescent eyes can’t be
duplicated, either. I found myself squinting to con-
jure the desired product; from some angles,
Dunaway looks like Yoko Ono in shoulder pads.

The casting of Dunaway is somewhat ap-
propriate; she, more than any current actress,
personifies stardom in the Crawford mold. But,
despite a faint resemblance, Crawford’s face has
merely been painted on Dunaway’s, resulting in
something uglier than either of them and a card-
board performance by Faye. She goes through no
fewer than two dozen wardrobe changes and hair-
dos, which help sustain a faltering image, and
Irene Sharaff’s costumes remain the most in-
teresting aspect of the picture.

 

MOVIE REVIEW

 

Mommie Dearest is ridden with other, non-cosmetic problems: a
weak script, undistinguished photography and numerous factual
errors. Dunaway’s performance does not carry the picture as it
might have. She’s obviously done her homework, nailing down
Crawford’s walk and mannerisms with stunning accuracy. But she
is inconsistent. She’ll open a scene with a perfect gesture and voice
modulated to sound just like Crawford’s. As the scene progresses,

however, she becomes Faye Dunaway again, and this hurts her in

the crucial (I should say excruciating) portions of the film, She
really tries, I think, but in the final analysis it just doesn’t come off.

To the credit of whoever did the casting, the child who
portrays Christina as ,a little girl is every bit as homely and
obnoxious-looking as old photographs of precious daughter
indicate. Instead of blossoming in adolesence she _ turns
into unattractive teenager Diana Scarwid, who adds nothing
to the part except to make Christina out to

be the sweetest, most put upon thing you could im-
agine.

Worst scene: there are many, but the ‘No more
wire hangers” bit really takes the cake. Dunaway,
smeared with cold cream, carries on like
something wild (a local in the audience kept say-
ing “‘She’s a witch, she’s a witch...’’). The actual
beating is unrealistic, with closeups of the hanger
making contact and a concurrent sound effect that
sounds exactly like a slamming door. Other parts
are equally awful but more fun, including a
glorious scene in which Dunaway leaps on the
sullen, tow-headed Scarwid, sending a table and
lamp to the floor, and nearly choking the girl to
death in the presence of a reporter from Redbook. |
Come on!

Best scene: in later years, when Christina is
sick and 64-year-old Mommie voluntarily replaces
her on The Secret Storm. The scene where
Crawford buffaloes the Pepsi board of directors is |
pretty good as well, even though it is an invention |
of the writers.

Mommie Dearest is laughable, making anything |
seém possible. When Joan brings sweetie pie a gift |
after ‘they’ve moved to New York, one half-|
expects it to be the rare tenderloin Christina refus-
ed to eat for lunch 15 years before.

A troubling aspect of the film is that it treats |

|
|

 

desserts instead of reasons behind her alleged
child abuse. There are other minor omissions, |
like two other adopted children (who have |
repudiated Christina’s story) and two marriages.
Her 1955 marriage to Alfred Steele is grossly
misrepresented — according’ to the movie
Crawford drove him to an early grave because she |
wanted a fancier apartment.

The movie also fails to mention that she gave up |
drinking for religion in her last years, but how |
would Christina know? The only time she saw her

_mother after 1972 was in Campbell’s Funeral |
Parlor five years later. The bit about Christina
tearfully accepting a T.V. award for ‘Mommie
Dearest” near the end is pure hogwash.

The director, Frank Perry, .collaborated with |
producer Frank Yablans and two others on the
worthless script. The rest of the cast is absolutely |
without distinction. Mommie Dearest might have
been better if it had been done in the film noir
mode, in black and white, with lots of shadows and
period music. But it’s a sorry movie, and certainly
no worse than its trashy source.

Poor Joan — her stellar reputation may have
survived untarnished had she but thrown a few
shillings at the sniveling wench in her will. That
probably would just have stalled matters, though.
Time doesn’t slow the greedy who find success on-
ly by picking at the bones of the dead.

 

 

 

 

Outing Club Seeks Participants

   

This year, the W&L Outing
Club has a very new, different,
and exciting schedule.

With an adequate sum lent by
the E.C., the Outing Club can
venture beyond the realm of
merely ‘“‘camping out.”’

If jumping out of a plane is
your trip, the Outing Club can
help you to make a dive. If you
enjoy hiking, take some ropes
and the Outing Club will teach
you. how to scale and rapell as

well.
If your idea of an outing ac-

tivity is somewhat feasible, and
not too bizarre, the Outing Club

will consider it.

Man cannot conquer the
vastness of nature alone,
however, The Outing Club has
the important ingredient
necessary for W&L students to
truly enjoy the beauty of nature
itself — women.

Many outdoor activities are
planned with all the girls’
schools.

On November 7-8 there will be
an overnight back-packing trip
with Randolph-Macon at Mar-
ble Springs. On November
14-15, a canoe and hiking trip
with Hollins is scheduled.

The race for the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference is coming to a close and the standings will
hit the proverbial fan this Saturday.

Undefeated Randolph-Macon travels to 3-1-0
Maryville and will hopefully come away with their
first ODAC loss, which would close the focus only
to Maryville, W&L, and Randy-Mac.

Of the teams in the ODAC, Washington and Lee
has the best record after seven games (five wins
and two losses). Maryville and Randolph-Macon
both follow after only six games with 4-2-0 records.

What must not be overlooked though is 101
points while giving up 47 on defense. W&L has
compiled 55 points on offense to 48 given up on:
defense. Conceivably, the title could come down to

have 108 yards on 367 attempts, averaging 154.4
yards per game. Hampden-Sydney ranks first

ODAC total-offense ranking with 3.7 yards per

leads the conference with an impressive 26 points
per game. W&L is second, scoring 14 points a
game.

The Genérals’ defense is the stingiest in the con-
ference against the run, allowing a mere 129 yards

six touchdowns throughout the season’ Emory and

Henry is the only team better than the Generals
against the pass, statistically, averaging 115 yards
a game. The Generals have had nine in-
terceptions in the 130 attempted passes, 52 of
which were complete. W&L ranks first in total
defense giving up 242 total yards per game.

The Generals also make individual appearances
in the ODAC top spots. Chris Cavalline is second
only to Hampster Tim Jones in rushing. Cavalline
has covered 639 yards thus far in 193 carries. Five
of those efforts have ended in the end zone. He is
also fourth in overall scoring and fifth in punting
and receiving. :

Sophomore Al Paradise placed third this week
in the passing race, completing 50 of 96 efforts for
seven completions-a-game. A more vital statistic
is that Paradise has thrown only five interceptions
so far this season. Steve Corbeille is averaging 7.2
in punt returns, the fourth best in the conference..
Pat McGuire ranks first among kick returners,
averaging 20 yards each time he brings it out.

Despite 3-6-1 mark thus far, the worst overall
mark in the conference, the W&L Soccer Team is
third in conference competition (2-2) behind

_ Lynchburg and Hampden-Sydney. Sophomore;
Roland Simon is sixth in ODAC scoring. After 10:

the brightest spot in this dismal soccer season is

coming to an average of 1.2 goals a game.

 

 

Booters Hope To Finish At.

by John Harrison

With only an outside chance
of finishing the season over .500,
the Washington and Lee soccer
team will travel to Lynchburg
College this Saturday with the
hope of achieving a winning
mark in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference.

‘he Generals fell to 3-6-1
overall by dropping both of last

week’s games, 3-2 on Wednes-
day to Roanoke and 10 to
nationally-ranked Messiah Col-
lege Saturday. This brings to
four the number of games W&L

nas lost by a single goal.

The loss to Roanoke was
perhaps the toughest of the
season to date.

W&L built a 2-0 lead on goals
by freshman Gary Clements
and junior Jerry Moyer in the
opening minutes of each half.
Roanoke was outplayed and
outhustled until it was awarded

a penalty kick on an elbowing
penalty with eight minutes re-
maining.

The Marooons converted and

then took advantage of a poor .

pass and a steal for the decisive

goals, both of which came with
less than six. minutes left in the
game.

Before today’s game with 3

VMI, Prianian tried to explain
the offensive slump which has
caused the Generals to go
without a victory since Sept. 29.

Against Messiah, Head Coach,

Mermen Top Seed

by G. Bruce Potter

The Washington & Lee water
polo Generals came from
behind to defeat Richmond 7-5
last weekend, finishing the
Southern League tournament
with a 9-0 mark and earning the
top seed for the league cham-
pionships, to be played Nov. 7-8
at W&L.

Hampden-Sydney College,
19-1, the North Carolina “B”
team, 20-1, and James Madison
University, 18-3, also fell victim
to the Generals, who set the
record for most wins by a W&L
water polo squad, 21. The
record for most wins by any
team in any sport at W&L is 23
by the 1976-77 basketball team,
and that mark appears to be in
jeopardy.

The University of Richmond
capitalized on a W&L defensive
mix-up to take a.3-0 lead mid-
way through the, first period.
“Tim Rock’s., superb defense
combined withi,Andy Gates’
goaltending prevented Rich-
mond from getting an insur-
mountable lead re we could
get our tee rganized,”’
commented Hi ‘oach Page
Remillard.

Washington and ‘Lee finally
took the lead in the key match-,
up during the second period.
“‘We played very, very well,”
said Remillard. ‘“‘We kept the
pressure on Richmond the en-

200

many opportunities, but we
came up short.”’ Messiah
scored 30 minutes into the se-
cond half.

Junior back Tad Renner led
W&L’s effort in last week’s
games, sharing player-of-the-
game honors with freshman
Glenn Jackson against Roanoke
and earning the same against

pressive in the backfield, .as the

tire game and just kept pecking
away at their lead. We’re happy
with the win.

“We stayed with our game
plan and did not make the
mistake of trying to catch up too
fast. The team showed a lot of
confidence in each other.”

This marked the first time
that Washington & Lee had
beaten the Spiders at Rich-
mond, and the Generals will be
there again this weekend for the
Virginia State Championships,
in which Remillard’s ‘“B” team
will see their first official action
of the season. However,
Remillard will insure that the
“B”’ squad does not make the
Sunday finals because he needs
them as potential substitutes
for the “A” squad in the an-
ticipated rematch between
Richmond and the Generals for
the state title.

Co-captain Erik Peterson
shattered the record for most
goals in a season as he upped
his total to 114, which included
three tallies as he led all scorers
in the Richmond game. Senior
Mike Bernot eclipsed his per-
sonal record for most scores in
a season also.

In addition, junior Ken

Johnstone snapped a slump by
scoring two goals against Rich-
mond, and goalie Andy Gates

Gridders Win.

by Dale Park

In Sewanee, Tennessee, last
Saturday, the Washington &
Lee varsity football team rolled
up its highest total offensive
output of the season and claim-
ed its third straight win with a
13-6 victory over the University
of the South.

A crowd of 3300 watched as
W&L jumped to a 10-0 first
quarter lead. Junior Bill Devine
put the Generals ahead, 3-0,
with a 31-yard field goal and
classmate Chris Cavalline later
dove in from two yards out for a
touchdown to cap a 52-yard
drive.

The score remained 10-0 until
mid-way through the fourth
quarter, when the Tigers scored
on a 73-yard touchdown drive
with only 9:11 left in the game.

Pittman commented that he
and McBryde decided to tie
“‘with about a mile to go.”’ Pitt-
man added, ‘‘I knew at the mile
mark we were going to beat
them.”’ According to Pittman,
the number five ‘“‘man’’ for
West Virginia Tech was a girl,
but he noted that this was not il-
legal.

The meet was, perhaps, best
described by a story Pittman
tells.

“At about 2-1/2 miles, we

and the West Virginia Tech
coach were standing there.
Neither of them said a word. I
think the West Virginia Tech
coach was in awe. We asked

have all your guys way ahead of

halfway through the race?’”’

president and chairman of the
Philadelphia Suburban Water
Company, which later became
a subsidiary of Philadelphia
Suburban Corporation when
that company was formed in
1968 with Ballengee as its presi-
dent and chairman.

The company was restruc-
tured in 1981 when Ballengee
became president and chair-
man of Enterra Corporation.

At Washington & Lee, Bal-
lengee graduated first in his law
class and was an editor of the
Law Review. He was elected to
membership in Phi Beta Kappa
and in the Order of the Coif, the
legal honor society. He is a 1946
graduate of Morris Harvey Col-
lege in West Virginia and was
awarded an honorary degree by
Morris Harvey in 1972. |

Since joining the W&L board,
Ballengee has served as chair-
man of the board’s budget and
audit committee and has been a
member of both the executive
committee and the nominating
committee.

Nuckols had served as rector
of the W&L board since 1974
when he was elected to succeed
the late Ross L. Malone in the
position. He had been a trustee
since 1969, when he was nom-
inated for board membership
by a vote of his fellow alumni —
the first board member to have
been elected to office in that
manner, —

Formerly senior vice presi-
dent of the Campbell Soup:Com-
pany, Nuckols earned both his
undergraduate and law degrees
from Washington & Lee. He was
national president of the W&L

Alumni Association in 1965-66
and was instrumental in insti-
tuting a series of special alumni
conferences to give former
W&L students the opportunity
to revisit the campus and gain
first-hand information about
the university and its students.

Mrs. Martin was elected to
the board in 1978. She is a past
president of The Garden Club of
Virginia and was author-editor
of “Follow The Green Arrow,”’
its 50-year history published in
1970. Mrs. Martin, a member-
at-large of The Garden Club of

In A Role Reversal,

Brothers Get Hazed

(continued from page 1)

Pi Phi has rlow.a $100 fine for
kidnapping, and has promised
the freshmen there would be no
hazing. Last year’s abduction of
a national representative by
freshmen pledges brought ex-
tensive social probation to the
house.

SAE Vandy Campbell was
lured out of the fraternity house
last Thursday night, abducted,
taken to Liberty Hall, an
covered with molasses and

feathers.
He was then taken back to the
Freshman Quad and left bound
in his underwear. ‘‘I hope they
enjoyed it,’’ Campbell told the
gawking freshmen, ‘because
they’re gonna pay for it.”
Sigma Chi Lee Nichols was
abducted two weeks ago on a
cold night and left in his boxer
shorts at Southern Seminary.
Nichols and spokesmen for the
house saw nothing wrong with

the prank.

 

Festival At Expoland

Augusta Expoland, located

near bucolic Fishersville, Va.,
was created ten years ago to
serve mainly as a location for
an annual weeklong country
fair. Each July, midway rides,
tractor pulls, cotton candy, cow
jshows and pickle contests
abound.
The Expo board has realized
that income must be maintain-
ed consistently throughout the
year, and has recently attemp-
ted to shed its redneck image by
featuring several non-country
concerts. Earlier this month,
for example, the ever-popular
Skip Castro Band teamed up
with Johnny Sportscoat and the
Casuals for an afternoon of
boogying.

. On Sunday, Nov. 8, Expoland
will be the site of ‘Fall Beach
Festival ’81.’’ This occasion
begins at noon and features a
day of concerts by The Embers,
The Catalinas, Steve Bassett
and the Virginia Breeze Band,
Bill Deal and th Rhondels and
Bill Pinkney and the original
Drifters. The #éstival will be
highlighted by'd shagging con-
test which offers'a'$100 prize.

While Fishersvitle itself is not
the mecca of ‘beach music,
Virginia’ and the Carolinas
seem to cling on to it more than
other places, so the location

 

might be considered appro-
priate. Tickets for “Fall Beach.
Festival” are $9 in advance and
$11 at the door. The shagging
contest will be held indoors.

Expoland is located on I-64 a
few miles from the junction of I-
81 and I-64 near Staunton. It is

by signs.

Tuesday afternoon § sherry
parties, the surrounding pubs,
the nudist colony bordering the
beautiful Isis River, full-figured
women, colorful foliage and the
daily tea time ritual — all this is
part of the fun-filled, (worth-
while) Oxford experience.

Picture the above-mentioned
sights along with one of the
finest individualized study pro-
grams offered anywhere and
you may get just a taste of what
W&L seniors Robert McLean,
Chris Muller, and Bo Parrish
enjoyed during their six-week
excursion to Oxford, England.

Under the Virginia Program

to Oxford, McLean, Muller, and —

Parrish journeyed abroad from
June 29 to August 7 with a group
of twenty-seven men and
women from Mary Baldwin,
Hampden-Sydney, Sweet Briar,
and Roanoke colleges.

Summed Bo Parrish of his
Oxford experience: ‘“You get so
much exposure to different
things.’’ That, it seems, is an .
understatement.

On the campus of St’ Anne’s
College in Oxford, the three at-
tended Monday through Thurs-
day classes in history and
English held in an informal and -
individualized manner.

Tutored, usually in groups of
three, for one hour sessions two
days a week and attending one
to two hour lectures four days a
week, the W&L trio were ex-
posed not only to prominent
historians and professors, but
also received the opportunity to
attend classes at various sur-
rounding colleges and univer-
sities. These included St.
John’s, Brasenose, and Univer-
sity College, some of which date
back to as far as the fourteenth
century.

Working under the English
tutorial system, McLain,
Muller, and Parrish learned to
present essays and critiques
and were graded upon the basis
of their ability to persuade
rather than on the accuracy of
their arguments. ;

Perhaps the most advan-
tageous aspect’ for the three
W&L seniors was the free time
and informal atmosphere of the
English life which provided

them with the opportunity of
establishing close friends and
lasting ties.

The convenient three day
weekends were often spent in
London (a mere hour’s train
ride from Oxford) which, com-
ments Muller, was great to
have access to but was expen-
sive and offered poor housing
facilities.

When not in London, the three
spent much of their time drink-
ing “bitter” or “lager,” as the

’ English refer to beer, at such

bars as the “Horse and
Jockey,” “The Perch,” and
several others located in the
quaint communities bordering
Oxford.

Whether playing croquet,
stretching out on the lawn of the
nearby University Park, or

“punting” (an afternoon coast
along the Isis River in a long,
flat boat), the trio had their
share of leisure time. But un-
doubtedly one of the greatest
assets of the entire trip was the
co-educational aspect of the
program.

Not only was the on-campus
housing co-ed (which, by the
way, proved highly sufficient
and comfortable), but men and
women shared classes together
as well. Needless to say, the
three well-graced W&L
gentlemen took full advantage
of the co-ed set up, and more
than one quiet weekend was
spent in the cozy countryside
beyond the city’s limits.

The Oxford experience,
McLean, Muller, and Parrish
agree, is an exciting, worth-

Law Center Host To
Judge-In-Residence

US. Circuit Judge Luther M.
Swygert is the first judge-in-
residence at Washington and
Lee University’s Frances Lewis
Law Center. Swygert recently
took senior status as judge for
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-
peals in Chicago.

As judge-in-residence,
Swygert: will spend three
months during the current
academic year - conducting
research at the Law Center in
W&L’s School of Law. His plans

are to research and write about
the procedure under which
counsel is appointed in certain
litigation at the federal level.

“T will be examining the dif-
ferent ways in which lawyers
are appointed in various cir-
cuits and also plan to look into
the possibility of establishing
uniform rules for’ the appoint-
ment of counsel,” Swygert said.

A graduate’ of the’ University
of Notre Dame, Swygert was

appointed “U.S*"Cifeuit Judge
for the 7th Circuit Court of Ap-
peals in 1961. From 1970 through
1975, he was chief judge of the
circuit which serves “Indiana,
Wisconsin and Illinois. By tak-

a

; Fine Te.
[ Nedhwork

and cross stitct

ing senior status this past July,
Swygert is ngt required to take
a full load of cases, but he does
intend to remain quite active as
a judge. 5

Previously, Swygert was
deputy prosecutor
mond, Ind.; assistant U.S. at-
torney for the northern district
of Indiana; and, U.S. District
Judge for the northern district
of Indiana. He has been award-
ed honorary degrees by the
Valparaiso School of Law and
Notre Dame.

According to Frederic §L.
Kirgis Jr., director of the
Frances Lewis Law Center and
professor of law at W&L, the
judge-in-residence program is
designed to attract
“distinguished judges who will
be involved in research on cur-
rently important topics.”

Since it was established ‘in
1972, the Law Center has had
several scholars-in-residence +
laW professors who have under-
taken research at the center. *

‘The Law Center is designed to
stimulate law reform through
scholarly research and by
holding conferences.

while venture. Above all, one is
exposed to the educational and
the social perspectives — of
England, both of which serve as
a valuable learning experience
in studying the entire scope of
British life. Bo Parrish claims,
“You do everything how you
want to do it. You get a lot more

out of it than just the studies.”’

“Take the opportunity to do
as much as you can,” adds
Robert McLean. ‘You get out of
it what you put into it.”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ririgtuim Phi

Talk Isn’t Cheap

Contact, the organization that drew fire last year
for its roster of ex-cons and political zombies, is in
need of funds. In case you haven’t heard, the price of
a quality speaker. has risen dramatically — and the
result is that small budgets such as Contact’s can at-
tract only mediocre talent.

To alleviate this problem, one Executive Commit-
tee member has suggested charging admission to
non-fraternity members and Lexington residents. We
find this suggestion to contradict the purpose of Con-
tact — one of providing an open forum of speakers to
the Lexington community.

The IFC apparently doesn’t have the money to pour
into Contact. Likewise, the EC has already commit-
ted itself to funding other groups. Perhaps Contact’s
savior can be found in Washington Hall. It doesn’t ap-
pear to be anywhere else.

Country Ethics

We've seen the posters advertising the play ‘“The
Country Wife.’”’ We can imagine one of two things:
either the Drama Department will do anything for at-
tention, or the play is so bad that students must resort
to sophomoric humor to bring attention to it.

Through its various sexual innuendos; the poster is
not only an insult to the intelligence of students, but is
also a sad indication of the wit of some W&L men.

Making subliminal advertisements in _ public
posters is something most of us were fortunate
enough to leave behind in high school. Obviously, a
few people on this campus never progressed beyonc
that level. v4 |

With Three Passed, Eight Rejected,

What Does Amendment Vote Show?

by Andrew Trotter
What is the significance of
last week’s vote on amend-
ments to the Student Body Con-
stitution?
The surprising thing is that
students voted. BOO]
Since 1974, amendments have;
died at the polls for lack of in-,
terest. The Constitution ‘re-
quires that at least 50 percent of
the student body express “yea” |
or “nay” on an amendment for |
a valid referendum. ;
‘This was achieved largely as
the result of EC members’ per-
sonal appeals to students.
President Eric Myers himself
stood by the polls for six hours
on Wednesday, exhorting pass-°
ing students to vote.
Sadly for the EC however, on-
ly three of the eight proposed

amendments were accepted by !

the required two-thirds margin.
The failed amendments includ-
ed one to eliminate the
Treasurer of the Student Body,
a position which has not been
filled for years.

The EC is thus in an awkward
position. Do W&L students ac-

 

Commentary

 

tually want a Treasurer? Or
were they just being difficult?

Another rejected amendment
was to ease the requirements
for the adoption of future
amendments. The W&L citizens
seem to want their constitu-
tional powers, everrif they rare-
ly choose to exercise them. .

This brings us to proposed
Amendment number seven,
concerning the relationship of
the EC to the Publication
Board. It would have changed
the EC mandate over the Pub
Board from “‘appellate jurisdic-
tion’’ to ‘powers of review.”

Some EC members insisted
that the amendment ‘“‘clarified’’
the relationship; rather than
changing its substance. The
amendment’s_ rejection in-
dicates that W&L students see
the implications of ‘‘powers of
review”’ for press freedom.

We may never know what
“appellate jurisdiction” is, but
we now know one thing that it is
not.

Ariel, Washington and Lee’s
literary magazine.

Executive Committee Listens To

Complaints Of Handling Of Checks

by Todd Smith

Despite merchants’ com-
plaints, bounced checks are be-
ing picked up on schedule, the
treasurer of the Cold Check
Committee told the Executive;
«Committee Monday night.

The E.C. also heard reports
on the stalled Intellectual Sym-:
posium, the Computer Club, the.
Rugby Club, and the W&L
Political Review.

Randall Jacoby was called in‘
to answer questions from Presi-
dent Eric Myers, who said that

Other E.C. members stated
that the liason role of thé com-
mittee required face-to-face
contact. t

“I think it’s running as
smoothly as the -year. before,”’
noted Myers. ‘It’s just that the
merchants don’t know it.”’

‘“‘Eppley (University
Treasurer) didn’t even know we
had a committee this: year ’til
Friday.”’

The E.C. recommended that
Jacoby and the committee send
a memorandum to merchants
explaining their policy.

In other business, , Frank
Smith, ’83 Rep., asked about the
status of the Intellectual Sym-
posium. A motion by Ben Hale,
84 Rep., at the Oct. 4 meeting
set Oct. 19 as the date for ap-
pointing members to the Sym-
posium committee. .

Posters announcing; this were
never produced, nor were the
faculty sent letters as specified
in the three-week-old motion.

A student seeking a.post on
the committee was ,tgld,to come
back next week. ‘‘Is.this just a
put-off?’’*heasked. _

Myers reported that officers
from the Computer Club and the
Mock Convention might work
together to offer the latter's
computer terminal to students
in help-sessions.

The Rugby Club treasurer
Todd Alexander was con-
gratulated by the E.C. for
defeating thé University of
Virginia. They played the B
team, “but a Wahoo is a

Eric Anderson reported that
the W&L Political Review hac
26 writers and was still in neec

Wednesday before Thanksgiv-
ing holiday begins.

Tom Booher, .’84L Rep., anc
Cole Dawson, ’85 Rep., served
at their first E.C. meeting Mon.
day, the shortest thus far.

Booher defeated Jim Greene
68 to 34 in the election for the
