by Bill Roberts

Twelve past and present of-
ficers of the Lexington Police
Department were formally ac-
cused Monday by a Rockbrdge
County Circuit Court grand jury
of involvement in various rob-
beries that occured in Lex-
ington during the past ten
years.

The accused include: R.F.

' Wright, J.C. Purvis, J.K. Col-
bert, W.L. Rhodenizer, T.A.
Colbert, D.E. Stubblefield, T.H.
Clark, M.R. Hamilton, D.E.
Moore, J.O. Moore, C.H.
Emore, and W.F. Knick.

The indictments are the
result of a six-week inquiry by
Commonwealth’s Attorney
Beverly C’ ‘‘John” Read, State
Police investigators, Special
Agent Tex Chapmen, and
Special Agent Lewis A. Layne.

Wright’s indictment on
charges of breaking into the

 

Virginia House Restaurant and .

number of active Lexington
police officers accused in the
theft ring to five. Colbert, Stub-
blefield, Clark, and Knick, the
other four officers, were
suspended by Chief J.A. Kirby
on Mar. 24.

Kirby is at Quantico this week
taking a course, and Lt. B.M.
Beard said that no action will be
taken to suspend Wright until
Kirby’s return.

Colbert was indicted for petit
larceny. He is charged with
stealing a jeep battery from
Lexington Motor Sales on Dec.
7, 1977.

Stubblefield was also indicted
for petit larceny. He is charged
with stealing two ballpoint pens
from Mays Real Estate in
March, 1979.

Clark was indicted on 11
counts of statuatory burglary,
conspiracy and petit larceny.
He is accused of breaking into

the A&P Store, 1s Dollar,
Spanky’s, and Coiner’s Parts in
conspiracy with Barry Flint.

Flint was suspended from the |

force in Oct., 1981, after his ar-
rest for the theft of $280 from
the Hop-In Store on N. Main St.
in 1977.

Knick was indicted on 14
counts for statutory burglary,
receiving stelen goods, con-
spiracy, grand and petit
larceny. He is charged with
stealing 15 packages of cheese
from Spanky’s. The grand jury
accused him of a series of four
burglaries from Adair-Hutton
occuring between January and
July of 1979. He is charged with
receiving stolen jumper cables,

from Coiner’s Parts by Purvis
and Flint. Knick was also in-
dicted for conspiracy with Flint
to break into Lexington Motor
Sales.

This Weekend:

Dobyns And 2 Concerts

Class reunions and concerts
will highlight the Alumni/Spr-
‘ing Weekend, which begins
tonight with a 8 p.m. speech in
Lee Chapel by W&L graduate
and N.B.C. News correspondent
Llyod Dobyns.
The classes of 1932, 1937, 1942,
1947, 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972,

. and 1977 will be featured during

‘the weekend. Also to be honored
are the “five Star Generals,”
which includes all classes
before 1932.

In terms of music, concerts
will be held Friday night and
Saturday afternoon. Friday’s
concert, which will be held at
Zollman’s Pavillion, features
the Robbin Thompson Band.
The concert will be free and
“bring your own beverage”’ in
the words of Student Activities
Board Co-Chairman-John Mar-
tin.

Following Saturday’s
lacrosse game against Hofstra,
the Producers will play on the .
upper athletic field. This con-
cert will also be free, with 30
kegs of beer provided by the In-
terfratenrity Council and the
Classes of ’83 and ’85. According
to Martin, the Class of ’83 is
donating $2750, the IFC $2500
and the Class of ’85 $250.

As of this writing the concert
was planned to begin at 5 p.m.

‘ after the law school finishes its

afternoon examinations. The
possibility may arise that the
lacrosse game may be pushed
back to a 3 p.m. start so that
there will be no delay between
the end of the game and the
beginning of the concert.

UC Approves Rush Proposal

by John Cleghorn

In a move that Dean Lewis
John calls “fine tuning,” the
University Council passed a
motion that will move the date
on which a rushee can pledge a
fraternity up one week on the
rush calendar for next fall,
shortening rush four days.

The Inter-fraternity Council
accepted the proposal in its
Tuesday night meeting, making
only small modifications.

Dean John said that the calen-
dar for next year meets what
has actually been taking place
in the last few years, referring
to the date on which rushees
were actually accepting bids.

“By moving the due date for

preference cards up four days,
the decision process will be over
sooner, which appeases some of
the faculty who feel that rush
begins to interfere with classes.
It was this sentiment that open-
ed the question of adapting
rush.

Two additonal changes have
also been made, said Dean
John. A special rush orientation
before contact begins will be
programmed to familiarize
freshmen with fraternities in-
dividually and collectively.

The second change is an ex-
tended open contact period for
the first three days of rush,
designed to let freshmen visit
fraternities before signing ‘up

signing up for open houses
which begin on the Sunday
before classes start.

A second part ot the U.C. mo-
tion stated that the Student Ac-
tivities Committee will study
the rush progrsm in approx-
imately three years for reap-
praisal.

An additional change over
last year’s calendar is the
switch of rush dates to Wednes-
day nights. Rush dates one and
two are on the first Friday after
classes begin, and rush dates
three and four are on the follow-
ing Wednesday. After rush
dates five and six on the next
Friday, the night on which

Plimpton:A Jockular Speech

by Charlie Alcorn

George Plimpton, the
renowned participatory jour-
nalist, charmed a packed house
at Lee Chapel Tuesday night
with some tales of his trade.

With a relaxed hands-in-the-
pockets style, Plimpton shared
the experiences of his certain
Style of journalism which
ranges from playing quarter-
back for the Detroit Lions and
the Baltimore Colts to being a
solo triangle player for Leonard
Bernstein’s New York Philhar-
monic. The oratory was punc-
tuated with his delightful com-
mand of the language and an
almost British-style elegance
that he most likely acquired
from his days in Cambridge as
a scholar.

The body of his speech dealt
with the history of participatory
journalism and how he became
associated with it. As a student
at Harvard, Plimpton yearned
to become a member of the
famous Harvard Lampoon. In
order to join, the editors of the
Lampoon told him that he had
to run the Boston Marathon.
Plimpton was game and he did
it, running the last three blocks
of the race to finish second
behind a possessed Korean who
made a mad sprint to beat him.
Plimpton was soon identified as
an imposter, but this high ex-
perience sparked the interest in
a career destined for glory.

Plimpton spoke of trying to go
beyond the vantage point of the
spectator into the personal

world of athletes — the likes of
which the world had never
heard from before.

He described his forage into
the particular athletic and
aesthetic fraternities as nearly
masochistic because it proved
without a doubt that there is no
room for an amateur in the pro-
fessional realm. He was quick
to add that this was as it should
be because if this were not the
case, the god-like qualities of to-
day’s pro athletes would be lost.

Plimpton saw the athlete’s
world as the stuff of which
daydreams are made, for it is
devoid of most of the problems
of everyday existence. Yet the
other side of the coin revealed a
constant state of pressure to

Archer also reported that
Focus’ spring forum is planned
for Monday, May 17. A speaker,
yet to be named, will discuss the
topic of a nuclear freeze.

The E.C. suggested that
Focus might benefit from Con-
tact’s resources in arranging
for a speaker next year.

E.C. President Eric Meyers
announced that a _ contract
almost identical to that of the

University of Virginia’s has
been arranged with Centel for a
telephone cooperative with
W&L students. Morgan Griffith
urged the phone subcommittee
to find a binding agreement to
insure the program for next
year.

The E.C. planned to appoint a
co-op student committee for the
remainder of the year at next
Monday’s meeting and hold
elections for a similar commit-
tee next fall. The E.C. has been
studying such a contract with
Centel since last fall.

handed down on Monday. He
said that there were ‘‘many
matters that were barred
because of the statute of limita-
tions.”’ said Read, ‘‘We sifted
through and screened a tremen-
dous amount of cases and
brought only a few to the grand
jury.

Read explained that misde-
meanors such as smoking mari-
juana must be _ prosectued
within one year. He did not in-
dicate that smoking marijuana
was part of the allegations
against the police, using it
merely as an explanatory ex-
ample. There is no statute of
limitations for felonies in
Virginia.

May 20 is the arraignment
date for those indicted. They
will be asked to enter a plea of

guilty, no contest, or not guilty.

“T have engaged in a limited
amount of plea bargaining,”
said Read. “I would expect cer-
tain officers to plead guilty as a
result of our investigation.”
Read did not state which of-
ficers to whom he was referr-
ing.

Read did comment that he ex-
pects Wright to be suspended on
Monday. All of those indocted
on Monday have been released
on bond. The Attorney
General’s office in Richmond
had been providing legal
guidance and advice on the in-
vestigation, according to Read.
Read would also not comment if
the indictments were the end to
the investigation.

State Police Investigators

' Chapmen and Layne presented

the evidence for the indictments
to the grand jury. They had
questioned Flint on Oct. 22,
1981, and taped his confession to
the theft of $280 from the Hop-In
store.

During the taping, in-
vestigators asked Flint whether
the store manager had told him
that she would tell Chief Kirby
about the theft. He replied that
she had not said she would tell
Kirby, but that she had told
Purvis about it.

There were rumors in Oc-
tober about other incidents of

misconduct by Lexington police
officers, but without Flint’s
cooperation, an investigation
was dropped.

It began again on Mar. 15
when Flint gave a statemnt to
the State Police immediately
after receiving a three-year
suspended sentence and proba-
tion for the Hop-In theft.

Read promised him immuni-
ty from further prosecution in
exchange for the information.
The terms of his probation were
left indeterminate, ensuring his
collaboration with the in-
vestigators.

Purvis had been questioned
twice by the State Police. He
and four others were indicted on
charges of conspiracy with
Flint. Five were indicted on
charges of conspiracy with Pur-
vis.

‘Entertainment

It wasn’t too long ago that you could safely predict that any band
hailing from Georgia would sport a trio of lead guitarists and a col-
lection of songs devoted to women, whiskey and general hellraisin’.
The Producers may call Atlanta home, but the music on ‘‘The Pro-
ducers,” the quartet’s debut Portrait album, is a striking blend of
pop and rock that’s far removed from standard southern boogie.

“The Atlanta scene is absolutely influenced by modern music,
what has gone on for the last two or three years, and that’s definite-
ly the scene we’re from,”’ says Kyle Henderson. ‘‘Atlanta has pro-
duced at least two major modern bands and that’s proof in itself
that it’s not the southern boogie scent. The B-52s are from Athens
but they played Atlanta constantly and the Brains, who didn’t sell
as well but met with great reviews, are from Atlanta.”’

  
  

The Producers — Van Temple (guitar/vocals), Wayne Famous
(keyboards/vocals), Bryan Holmes (drums/vocals) and Hender-
son (bass/vocals) — learned their instruments in the usual assort-
ment of original and cover bands in and around the Atlanta club cir-
cuit. The band formed when Henderson caught Temple, Famous
and Holmes playing at Uncle Tom’s Tavern in Atlanta on New
Year’s Eve of 1979.

Struck by a personal affinity with their music, Henderson im-
mediately asked them if he could join the band. After an introduc-
tory jam that night proved that the chemistry was there, The Pro-
ducers officially became a band on New Year’s Day, 1980.

They spent the next few months rehearsing and writing new
material before returning to the club circuit, mixing dates featur-
ing their own songs with cover jobs to keep the money flowing. ‘“‘We
played with the Pretenders at the Agora in Atlanta,” Holmes
remembers, ‘‘and the next night we went across the street and
played cover songs at a fraternity party at Georgia Tech.”’

In August, the band’s manager contacted producer Tom Werman

(Cheap Trick, Ted Nugent, Molly Hatchet) about working with the
band. When Werman suggested the band come up to New York to
play for him, The Producers promptly cancelled some Florida club
dates and hopped into a van for the drive north.
_. “We drove 17 hours straight to play one 45 minute set for him at
| SIR in New York,” Henderson recalls. ‘‘We were all hoping he
- would say, ‘Sounds good, let me hear a tape.’ We would have con-
sidered that a positive statement in this day and age.”

Werman’s response was a good deal more enthusiastic than that,
and listening to The Producers will provide more than enough
reasons why. The album reveals a distinctive, impeccable blend of
basic rock drive, pop craftsmanship and memorable melodic hooks
to burn on a collection of a dozen group-penned original songs.

“Usually, one or two people have the original idea, but we’re try-
ing to give the job of arranging a song as much importance as possi-
ble,”’ maintains Henderson. ‘‘How the songs end up sounding is
very dependent upon the input of all four members, everybody is
getting credit “‘

In the tradition of most great rock bands, the Producers have
synthesized their individual influences into an imaginative, ac-
cessible style of their own. Werman’s crisp, crackling production
captures the assured power of the band’s performance on material
| ranging from driving rock (‘‘Sensations,” ‘‘Who Do You Think You
Are’’) To catchy pop (‘‘Boys Say When,” ‘‘What She Does To Me’’).

| The lead vocals, shared by Temple and Henderson, are
augmented by beautifully crafted and executed backing har-
/ monies, The lyrics offer fresh twists and provocative insights into )
| that most universal of themes, moderh romance.

“There’s no sense in writing about something if no one’s going to
understand what you're talking about,’’ Famous contends. ‘“‘We
really take pride in pushing the lyrics out so you can understand
them. There is a meaning in the songs and we don’t want to disguise
."

‘“‘We feel, across the board as a band, that simplicity is a virtue,
not a liability,’’ Henderson sums up. “If there’s a musical idea
that’s great in its simplest form, then keep it that way. To add too
much toa simple, great idea is to take its greatness away.”’

‘Chariots’ Catches On Fire

by Todd Jones

Put simply, Chariots of Fire
is a superb movie.

It is one of those rare in-
stances in film where the movie
comes across as a group pic-
ture, without specific stars,
without especially ‘‘high’’
scenes. The movie is to be taken
as a whole and, when taken as
that whole, is immensely suc-

' cessful.

The story surrounds four run-

Bookstore

Charles Bracelen Flood,
author of the successful new
book, “‘Lee: The Last Years,”
will be in Washington and Lee
University’s Bookstore on Fri-
day (May 7) from 3:30 p.m. to5

p.m.
Flood will autograph copies of
his book, which deals principal-
ly with Lee’s presidency of
Washington College (Wash-
ington and Lee University) and
his role as the prime healer of
the bitterness between North
and South after the Civil War.

Flood’s book, which was
published last fall, has received
glowing reviews. Flood did a
great deal of research for the
book at Washington and Lee,
and many photographs from the
university’s collection appear
in the book.

Flood is a resident of Rich-
mond, Ky.; and is the author of
nine books, including the best-

Years’’ will be available at the

Jewish student at Cambridge,
the other a minister in Scotland.
It deals with the crises they
each face.

For the first runner, played
by Ben Cross, the crisis is being
Jewish in a part of society
where there are no Jews. It is
fighting with the administration
because he hires a private
coach to improve his running
ability. And it is winning the

, heart of a famous Gilbert and

Sullivan operetta star.

For the other runner, played
by Ian Charleson, the crisis is
deciding whether or not he can
compromise his dedication to
the ministry by spending so
much time running. And an
especially trying crisis is when
he gets to Paris only to learn
that the trials for his event are
on a Sunday, a day on which, in
his heart, he knows he cannot

Lax Breaks Even In One-Goal Decisions
Roanoke Comeback Thwarted, 11-10

by John Harrison

The Washington and Lee
lacrosse team will be host to
Hofstra University this Satur-
day at 2 p.m. on Wilson Field as
part of Spring and Alumni
weekend festivities.

The Generals will enter the
game with a 6-4 record (not in-
cluding yesterday’s match at
Roanoke College) and a ranking
of 12th in the U.S.I.L.A. poll.
The Flying Dutchmen, led by
seven-year coach Harry Royle,
will bring a 3-8 mark to Lex-
ington. Hofstra was also on the
road yesterday at Rutgers.

The Dutchmen beat W&L in
overtime, 7-6, two years ago to
take a 16-3 lead in the series.

Despite its unimpressive
record, the school from Hemp-
stead, New York, could prove to
be an enigma for the Generals.
“They’re up and down a lot.”’
said W&L Head Coach Jack
Emmer. “‘They lost to (seventh-
ranked) Maryland by one and
beat Towson State 13-8.”’ By
comparison, the Generals need-
ed an overtime period to down
Towson six weeks ago.

Tri-captain Mike Pressler
noted that the team should not
be complacent from overcon-
fidence in preparing for Satur-
day’s match. ‘“‘They’ve had a
tough year but we’re not count-
ing out those guys. They score a
lot and give up a lot,’’ the senior
defenseman said.

The Generals slipped to 12th
in the latest poll and 16 points
behind 1ith-ranked Syracuse
after last Saturday’s 15-14 loss
to the Orangemen in the Car-
rierdome.

W&L held a 14-13 lead when
Dave Dresko scored on Greg
Tarbell’s fifth assist of the day

 

A goal by Mike Schuler and a fine defensive play
by Dave Nickels stopped a Roanoke rally and
helped the Washington and Lee lacrosse team
down the Maroons 11-10 in Roanoke yesterday.

Schuler’s goal came with 6:12 left in the game
after two Roanoke goals within a nine-second span
had cut a three-goal General lead to 10-9.

Roanoke cut the margin back to one with 53
seconds left on a tally by John Remsen, and the
Maroons won the ensuing crucial faceoff. Sean
Smith then had a good shot to tie the score, but
fired high over the net.

Roanoke retained possession, however, and
Paul Goldsmith went straight for the net.
Goldsmith had already scored five goals and two
assists, but he was denied this time as Nickels
checked the ball away from him,and teammate

Washington and Lee’s record to 7-4.

The score was tied at three after one period of
play, and the Generals took a 5-4 lead into the half.
They then outscored Roanoke 3-1 in the third
quarter and took a 10-7 lead in the fourth on senior
John Sancilio’s third goal of the game.

Goalie Phil Aiken had 14 saves for Washington
and Lee, and the two Roanoke goalies made a total
of 24 saves for the Maroons, ranked number three
in Division III.

The Generals had 53 shots to Roanoke’s 50 and
gained possession of 62 ground balls. The Maroons
came up with 52.

Roanoke, however, won 14 of 25 faceoffs.

Senior Rob Staugaitis picked up three assists for ‘

the Generals to up his career total to 110, 19 short
of the Washington and Lee record. Schuler added

Tim Schurr grabbed the loose ball

to up _ twoassists.

 

 

 

to tie the score with 5:43 re-
maining. With 2:56 left, Brad
Short’s third goal off a Brad
Kotz pass gave the Orangemen
their fifth win in nine games.

There were ten ties in the
match, with the biggest lead by
either side being two goals.

Syracuse held an 11-9 margin
after three periods, but W&L
grabbed the lead early in the
last quarter with three straight
tallies. Mark Knobloch capped
the rally with a score at 12:24 to
make it 12-11, Generals.

Tarbell scored two straight
goals for a 13-12 Syracuse lead,
then Bob Carpenter and John
Sancilio put W&L back on top,
14-13, with 6:34 to play.

Sancilio finished with a game-
high five goals for the Generals.
Goalie Phil Aiken, who earned
the start over Ware Palmer,
made 19 saves. Attackman
Mike Schuler, who had to be put
on crutches following the game
and is doubtful for Hofstra, add-
ed three assists.

“Overall, we had a good ef-
fort. We outplayed them slight-
ly in every category, but we
couldn’t sustain it,’’ Pressler
said. ‘‘We had the extra-man
situation with a minute to go, so
we had our chances.”

Coach Emmer added, “‘It’s a
shame we didn’t win, because
we deserved it after the U.Va
game and the Armadillo
against UNC.”’

The Armadillo stall tactic
was outlawed last week by the

U.S.IL.L.A. Rules Committee.
By a 7-1 vote, the committee ad-
ded a clarification to the rule on
withholding the ball from play.
The addition gives game of-
ficials power to charge a 30-
second technical foul if, in their
opinion, a team is deliberately
withholding the ball, regardless
of where it is on the field.

According to committee
president and U.M.B.C. Head
Coach Richard Watts, ‘“‘Some-
thing had to be done right away.
It could have been a severe pro-
blem the rest of the season and
in the playoffs.’’

Emmer acknowledges that
W&L’s chances of making the
playoffs are slim at this point,
but ‘‘we may slip in there. Right
now, we’re just playing to have
a good year. We’ve been very
competitive except for U.Va.
Our last two games won’t be
easy for us.”

Generals Lose Four, Drop To 8-19

by Andrew P. Hoppes

W&L’s baseball team lost
four games this past week,
finishing their ODAC schedule
with a 5-9 record and standing
at 8-19 overall with two games
remaining.

Last Wednesday against
Longwood, W&L fell behind ear-
ly and never caught up.
Longwood scored four times in
both the sixth and seventh in-
nings to turn a close game intoa
13-2 rout. Dave Randall took the
loss for W&L. :

W&L was limited to five hits.
Senior Thad Ellis pounded two
hits and scored both W&L runs.

In W&L’s last league contest
on Thursday, Lynchburg
defeated the Generals 10-3. The
loss, combined’ with
Bridgewater’s forfeit victory
over Randolph-Macon,
eliminated the Generals from
playoff contention.

W&L got many baserunners |

into scoring position in the
game, but could score too few of
them. Thad Ellis had three hits
and senior Jeff Haggerty and
junior Chris Cavalline had two
apiece.

Freshman Bill White, the only
member of the pitching staff to
return next year, absorbed the
loss. Although hit hard by
powerhouse Lynchburg, Coach
Jim Murdock feels White will be
one of the better pitchers in the
league in a couple of years.

W&L lost Monday afternoon
at V.M.I., 10-6, despite collect-
ing a dozen hits. ‘‘We made
some mental errors on the base
paths to take ourselves out of a
couple innings,” noted Mur-
dock.

W&L fought back from a 5-3
deficit in the game to tie the
score at 5-5. Juniors Jody Har-
ris and Chris Cavalline keyed
the rally with two hits and
sophomore Mike Walsh ripped
three hits and drove in four runs
for the Generals.

The Keydets ended any hopes
W&L had of beating them twice
in the same season by scoring
five late runs. V.M.I. scored
three times in the seventh and

twice in the eighth to seal the

win.
Tuesday the Generals lost a
12-10 slugfest to Newport News

Apprentice in the season’s
home finale.

With Newport News in front
4-0, W&L scored three times in
the third. Mike Walsh had a
two-RBI single and Chris
Cavalline accounted for the
other run with a single.

The Generals still trailed 5-4
going into the bottom of the
sixth, when they used some
heads-up baseball to the score.
Senior Tripp Brown dropped a
successful suicide squeeze bunt
to score senior Mark
McLaughlin.

In the seventh, W&L scored
four more times to assume a
commanding 9-5 lead. Two runs
scored when sophomore Dave
Warrenfeltz executed another
suicide squeeze and Newport
News erred on the play.
Sophomore Kevin Lolden plated
the other two runs with a sharp
single up the middle.

Newport News refused to
quit, though, and scored three
times in the eighth and four
times in the ninth to earn a 12-10
decision. Losing pitcher Jim

The ‘Armadillo,’ Cont.

Reprinted with permission from the May I, 1982 edition of the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch.

An NCAA rules committee deserves a cheer for swiftly barring
any repetition of the Armadillo that Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
coach sprang on the unsuspecting No. 1-ranked North Carolina Tar
Heels when they visited Lexington last weekend.

The Armadillo, as invented by Coach Jack Emmer and entertain-
ingly described Thursday by T-D sports writer Jerry Lindquist, en-
tailed five W&L players locking arms and forming an impenetrable
shell, as an armadillo, around a teammate who has the ball. Ob-
ject: stall, delay, kill the clock, sit on the ball, give your team a
chance to upset a clearly superior team.

The “highly partisan” W&L crowd loved the Armadillo as it very
nearly enabled the Generals to snap mighty UNC’s 19-game winn-
ing streak. But while we are biased, too, when it comes to choosing
sides between Gen. Lee’s College and the University of Tarheelia,
we are not fond of action-killing strategy in any sport designed for
movement. (Maybe chess is an exception.) Even if the underdog,
or in this case armadillo, is burying the ball mainly to keep from
being annihilated, we’d rather see the fellows go down fighting in-
stead of just going down.

Still, we must confess to finding poetic justice in the W&L coach’s
selection of a foe on which to sic the Armadillo. And we are amused
by the surly reaction from the Tar Heels, with their goalie calling
the W&L delaying tactic garbage and their coach hurrying to drop
W&L from UNC’s schedule. Are memories so short? Only last
month another No. 1-ranked UNC team, coached by the sainted
Dean Smith, took the air out of a basketball for the final 13 minutes
of the Atlantic €oast Conference tournament championship in
order to defeat the University of Virginia. And the Tar Heels had no
excuse of being a definite underdog in that contest, though their
coach acted as though they were one.

Is the Armadillo, now blessedly extinct, really so different in
principle from the Polar Bear that some basketball teams use to
chill an opponent (and fan interest) when they can do so within the
rules?

Netters Finish Third;

by David Stuart
The Washington and Lee ten-
nis team came in third place,
but two freshmen, Andy Haring
and Stephen Bendheim, and the
number two doubles pair of Wes
Yonge and Jim Irwin captured
second places in their flights in
last weekend’s Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tennis tour-
nament at W&L.
Hampden-Sydney won four of
six singles titles to place first in
the event, and Lynchburg swept
the other two singles champion-
ships to come in second.

Haring Drops Thriller

Haring, known for his thrill-
ing tie-breaker victories and
steady strokes, held out for
three hours before losing, after
a three-minute match point, 6-7,
6-4, 7-5. In the first set, he came
back from a 5-3 deficit to win
the tiebreaker seven points to
five.

Bendheim made a_ great
comeback in the second set of
his singles final, but was stop-
ped 6-1, 6-4, by Kevin Farina of
Hampden-Sydney.

In other matches, Yonge and
Irwin dropped their doubles
final. Craig Cannon and Charlie
Kalocsay each won consolation
finals in singles to take third
place. The scores were 6-3, 6-2,

Hampden-Sydney may have
won the ODAC title, but Lynch-
burg laid claim to the number
one singles champion. Buzz
Frey, seeded second in the tour-
nament, was shaken by the
Tigers David Fredway in the
first set, but recovered to win
24, 61, 6-1. Fredway had
beaten Frey handily 6-3, 6-0, a
week earlier.

Patience Pays

A Lynchburg senior, Frey pa-
tiently waited his chance and
took advantage of Fredway’s
unforced errors. H-SC tennis
coach Bobby Saylor said to his
players before the matches
that, ‘‘This game is played with
your hands and your feet.”’

Fredway was reported to
have said, “You're right,
coach,” after his loss in the
singles final.

Two Freshmen Second

The W&L squad ended the
season on the road Tuesday at
Radford University. Craig Can-
non finished the season on a
high note by winning his
number one singles match, 1-6,
6-2, 6-2. The team, however,
posted an 8-1 loss, making the
final season record 6-17.

Yonge Closes Career

Tennis coach Gary Franke
will lose veteran, number two
player Wes Yonge to graduation
this year but can also look for-
ward to Steve Denny returning
after a year abroad. Franke
said, ““Yonge has been a consis-
tent performer for four years”
and has played “better tennis
this year than he ever has
before.’’

McKee, McBryde Lead W&L

Senior John McKee and
sophomore Angus McBryde
claimed titles this past Satur-
day, May 1 to lead Washington
& Lee to third place in the sixth
annual Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Track and Field
Championships held at W&L’s
Wilson Field.

McKee, from Clarksdale,
Miss. won the shot put competi-
tion with a toss of 45 feet, 11 and
one-half inches to outdistance
his nearest competitor by more
than two feet. McBryde, from
Charlotte, N.C. earned first
place in the 1500-meter run in
the closest event of the day. His
time of 4:02.48 edged the
runner-up’s mark of 4:02.50.

W&L finished with 50 team
points to place behind Lynch-

burg College’s ‘74 and
Bridgewater College’s 51.
Eastern Mennonite (41),

Roanoke (23), Emory & Henry
(22), and Maryville (11) com-
pleted the scoring. Over 130
athletes participated in the
meet.

Baseball—

Stanley was plagued by bad
hops, some errors, and a few
walks in the two innings he
worked.

The loss could not totally
obscure two fine defensive
plays turned in by W&L’s senior
co-captains in their last home
game. Centerfielder Thad Ellis
made a superb diving catch of a
line drive in the fourth, and first
baseman Jeff Haggerty made a
leaping grab on a viciously hit
liner in the fifth.

W&L concludes its season on
Saturday with a doubleheader
at Christopher Newport.

“To place third with a
relatively young team is
respectable,”’ offers 12th-year
head coach Norris Aldridge, ex-
plaining that ten of W&L’s 12
place-winners were freshmen,
sophomores, or juniors. ‘‘Our
men had personal-best perfor-
mances in nearly every event
and helped us to our best show-
ing in the ODAC meet since 1977
(when the team also placed
third).”’

Junior Eric Nelson
(Charleston, W.Va.), classmate
Sparky Anderson (Pulaski,
Va.) and sophomore Charlie
Alcorn (Victoria, Tex.) earned
high finishes for W&L in the
field events. Nelson placed
fourth in both the discus and
javelin competitions, Anderson
second in the javelin, and
Alcorn third in the discus and
shot put events.

In the races junior Alan Ar-
mitage (Port Elizabeth, Maine)
placed third in the 1l0-meter
high hurdles, freshman Scott

Henderson (Maryville, Ohio)
third in the 400-meter hurdles,
senior Russ Rector (Kansas Ci-
ty, Mo.) fourth in the 400-meter
hurdles, classmate Frank Pitt-
man (Atlanta, Ga.) fifth in the
1500-meters, and sophomore
Kevin Kadesky (Dallas, Tex.)
fifth in the 200-meters.

W&L’s 400-meter relay team
of Kadesky and freshmen Der-
rick Freeman (Birmingham,
Ala.), Chris Ives (New Orleans,
La.) and Chris Busbee (Dallas,
Tex.) placed second and set a
new school record of 44.02
seconds. The Generals’ mile-
relay team of Busbee,
sophomore Paul Chapman
(Shorts Hills, N.J.), freshman
Martin Pruitt (Covington, Va.)
and classmate Mark Pembroke
(Shorewood, Wis.) finished in
fourth place.

W&L concluded its season by
competing on Tuesday, May 4in
a dual meet at Bridgewater.
The Generals took a 5-1 record
into that event.

Beatty spouted the character he

As for Plimpton’s future
plans, he admitted a passion to
join a rock band for a short stint
and declared himself from

Warren Beatty once called
Plimpton ‘the man who has

seems to be the only thing

An Evening In Durham With Some Grateful Deadheads

by John Wells

RICHMOND—With no T.V.
here and a little free time I
realize the weeks melt away
this spring and with them, my
final opportunities to write
about anything on my mind — a
unique privilege I’m sure I shall
miss. And there are a few things
I want to write about, that I’ve
been considering for more than
a while. The first is the
phenomenon of the Grateful
Dead.

Surely it is an ongoing
phenomenon, as the myth
perpetuates itself among
younger and younger Dead-
heads. And while they are un-
doubtedly a small segment of
our population, they are
definitely there. Go to a Dead
concert.

I did, last month, at Duke
University, the first show of the
group’s current tour. I had seen
them before, in 1978, and had
long planned to spend this par-
ticular weekend in nearby
Chapel Hill, N.C., where a
friend of long-standing hap-
pened to procure us tickets to
the concert.

A W&L friend expressed sur-
prise at my going; ‘I didn’t
know you were into the Dead,”’
said he. I replied that, despite
my staid demeanor, I, too, have
an appreciation for the par-
ticular talents of the Grateful
Dead. I did not say I was a
Deadhead, although I was
tempted, because something in-
side would not allow me to

O.W. Riegel, for whom the
facilities will be named, served
for 34 years as head of the
department of journalism and
communications at Washington
and Lee. He is generally
credited with developing the
university’s journalism _ pro-
gram from a modest infancy in-
to an important center for the
education of young journalists.

A graduate of the University
of Wisconsin with a master’s
degree from Columbia Univer-
sity, Riegel was a member of
the Washington and Lee faculty
from 1930 until his retirement in
1973.

Prior to coming to
Washington and Lee, he had
worked on newspapers Ddeth in
the United States and abroad.

make such an admission, and I
would later find out why.

Despite the fact that ‘‘Work-:

ingman’s Dead’’ is one of my
favorite albums.

There used to be a lot of show
biz one-liners centering around
the old cliche of ‘‘where
Vaudeville went to die.’’ No one
seems to talk about where the
Flower Children have gone to
die, but if they should ever
bother to ask, they need to look
no further than the nearest
Grateful Dead concert.

Driving into the outer reaches
of the Duke campus, small
clusters of Deadheads, clad in
denim and tie-dye, passed
smoking objects and beckoned
passers-by for tickets. My first
thought was, “‘Christ, I didn’t
bring my bandana. How
boorish, how unchic. Will the
faux pas go undetected?’’ For-
tunately it did, even though
headbands were definitely the
order of the day.

The crowd waiting in the
vicinity of the gym was both
rowdy and mellow. About a hun-
dred who couldn’t get tickets
sat on a nearby hill to listen.
Ticket holders jammed in the
doors and ran immediately for
the best general admission
seats.

I purchased a Dead T-shirt.
Then we sat and waited for the
proceedings to commence.

The Dead sauntered out at
about quarter after nine to an
uproarious audience response.
For the next hour and a half,

He is internationally known as
an authority on propaganda.
His classic work, ‘Mobilizing
for Chaos: The Story of the New
Propaganda,” was originally
published in 1934 but was

_ brought back into print almost

40 years later by the book-
publishing division of the New
York Times.

Riegel emphasized practical
experience as an integral ele-
ment in the university’s jour-
nalisfh curriculum, Broadcast
journalists were given exten-

they did their thing to. the
general approval of all. How
can they go wrong? They have a
built-in audience of adoring

followers wherever they want to’

play, and they tour almost an-
nually to sell-out crowds. Their
endurance is remarkable when
one considers they’ve never had
a true Top 40 hit, and that fact,
in my opinion, entitles them to
an overwhelming amount of
esteem. -

 

At least as entertaining as the
actual performance is the off-
stage spectacle provided by the
hardcore Deadhead contingent.
Those who thought rhythmic
contortionists were relegated
no the ranks of twisting shakers
of Soul Train are wrong. All
around, bodies sway gently and
violently, long hair flying, hips
gyrating. Four years ago, I
recalled, it was the first five
rows who swayed to and fro
ceaselessly, mesmerized by the
words and music and whatever
was in their systems.

the absence of vocalist Donna

Garcia,
performed dutifully. They know
what the crowd pleasers are,
and during ‘‘Truckin’” got a
predictably shrill response to
the refrain ‘‘What a _ long,
strange trip it’s been.”’

There were three extended
jams, a trademark of Dead
shows, and periods enjoyed
lustily by the hardest-core
Deadheads. I had remembered
the 1978 jams as having been
more spirited. Garcia, at one
point, had grabbed a folding
chair and used it as percussion
instrument. I became more
detached during these jams,
though, and realized why I had
not been able in good cons-
cience to identify myself as a
Deadhead. This is what they’re
all about, and I simply didn’t

get off. It was a good show, un-
doubtedly, but while it was the
stuff that spins legends in the
minds of many, it was not so
with me, although the Dead are
as close to being legendary as
any other group still playing. I
consider them to be an all time
great, even if I can’t totally
agree (but thoroughly under-
stand) my friend who says for
his money the Dead puts on a
better show than the Stones.

Although the Dead following
swells year by year, the majori-
ty of the faithful are definitely
not teenagers, and that is as it
should be. Most of those who
camped on the sidewalk near
Broadway and 50th St. in New
York City for a Dead show at
Radio City in 1980 were older
still. And the snide appellation
of Granola Groupies does not
hold when one looks at the
unhealthy pallor and rather
fried-looking eyes of these folks.

You have to have a built-in
appreciation. Jane Fonda took.
her kids to see the Dead in L.A.
a couple of years ago, and ex-
plained to them that the group
“is really quite good.” The
adolescents squirmed unap-
preciatively.

Well, at least she exposed
them to the Grateful Dead, and
more people should give them a
closer examination. Beyond the
realm of popular music as con-
fined to the O’Jays and Janice,
such exposure would seem to be
‘desirable.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Indictments

We can only speculate on the reaction that the front
page story on the indictment of 12 Lexington police of-
ficers will receive from our readers. The initial reac-
tion will, of course, be one of ‘‘I told you so.”’ That
reaction will likely be followed by a few chuckles.
“Stole a ham, that’s funny.”’ “‘Stole a few pens, that’s
funny.”

 

 

 

Perhaps we should stop and think about this for a
* few minutes. Too often, stories and editorials reflect
nothing more than venom. This was the case last
March when we ran an ediotrial on the L.P.D. In that
example, we chastised the entire L.P.D. for being a
bunch of no-goodniks. We do not mean to go the op-
posite direction now — we are not defending the men
who stand accused. We only want to go on record as
saying that before berating the L.P.D. during these
times, perhaps we should remeber that 12 people, not
just 12 objects, are on trial.

To read a story about a man stealing a ham should
not induce laughter. If anything, this should make the
reader feel fortunate that he or she has never done
such a thing. Granted, one must always be alarmed:
when stories of fraud, theft, and corruption arise. But
we believe that reactions to these stories are not real-
ly those of alarm, but those of smugness. One should
be alarmed that members of the L.P.D. are accused
of theft, but they should not be overly smug or sar-

‘ eastic because of the misfortunes of someone else.

We often accuse the local police for a callousness
toward the student body. When we laugh at the
downfall of local policemen, are we not also guilty of
this same callousness?

Tsuji To Lecture On Buddha

Kenryu Takashi _ Tsuji,
minister of Ekoji Buddhist
Temple in Springfield, Va., will
lecture on ‘‘Buddha-Dharma:
The Way of Enlightenment” on
Monday, May 10, at 8 p.m. in du-
Pont Auditorium on the Wash-
ington and Lee University cam-

us

The lecture is sponsored joint-

ly by the East Asian Studies
program and the department of
religion at W&L. The public is
invited.

From 1968 through 1981,
Bishop Tsuji was presiding of-
ficer of the Buddhist Churches
of America (Shin Buddhist
denomination) with its national
headquarters in San Francisco.
During the same period, he was
president of the Institute of
Buddhist Studies at Berkeley,

Dear Sir:

I am writing in regard to the.

discussion of fraternity rush in
last week’s Ring-tum Phi
(‘‘New Rush; Same Problems”
and “A New Rush?” April 29
issue, p. 2).

I regret that the numerous
factual errors of those articles
may detract from an
understanding of both the cur-
rent and the new rush pro-
cedures. To point out a few of
the more obvious and glaring
inaccuracies:

(1.) ‘This resolution...in-
volves shortening rush from six
to four weeks.’’ Wrong. The pro-
posal adopted by the University
Council on April 29 permits
pledging after the beginning of

- the second weekend (rather

than the third, as stated in the
previous policy) following the
start of classes during the fall
term. Rush may theoretically
be shortened by one week,
although the proposal presented
by the Student Affairs Commit-
tee to the University Council on
April 29 would actually shorten
rush by only four days.

(2.) “By relocating earlier in
the month the date at which
freshmen are permitted to

tear...’’ Wrong again..

Freshmen this year were al-
lowed to accept bids after the
fourth rush date on September
25, 1982. Under the Student Af-
fairs Committee proposal for
next fall, freshmen will be
allowed to accept bids after the
sixth rush date, on September

24, which allowed to accept bids .

after the sixth rush date, on
September 24, which is the
same relative time (the second
Friday following the start of
classes).

(3.) “(fraternity) members
exceed 80 percent of the student
body...’’ At the end of the fall
and winter terms this year, the
actual figures were 63.1 percent
and 62.5 percent respectively.

Campus debate on important
issues is healthy and to be en-

Cal. He is the author of many
publications in the field of Bud-
dhist studies.

In 1981, Bishop Tsuji
established the first Shin Bud-
dhist congregation in the
“Washington, D.C., area with the
dedication of Ekoji (The
Gift of Light Temple) in Oc-
tober.

Bishop Tsuji’s denomination
traces its lineage to Shinran'
(1173-1262), a Japanese Bud-
dhist who founded the Pure
Land Shin sect in medieval
Japan (during the lifetime of
Francis of Assisi and Thomas
Aquinas). The Pure Land scrip-
tures, which originated in India,
were translated. into
Chinese and subsequently in-
troduced into Japan.

While Zen Buddhist may be

 

couraged. Opinions can and will
differ on subjects such as the
importance and value of frater-
nities, the thoroughness of the
studies conducted this year on
fraternity rush, and certainly

better known in the West, Shin
Buddhism is the largest and
most significant religious
movement in Japanese history;
in part because it provides a
path for lay Buddhists. The first
missionaries arrived in the
‘United States in 1898. In the
United States mainland and
Hawaii, there are 150 temples
and branches served by 130
ministers. Membership is
estimated at 100,000.

Shin Buddhist thought has at-
tracted the attention of western
scholars for the apparent
similiarity with Christian doc-
trine. The key to salvation is
faith alone rather than anything
human beings can achieve
through their own efforts such
as ritual practices, meditation,
or good works.

Phi Rush Errors Corrected

the ‘desirability of delayed or
deferred rush. I hope in the
future, however, that Ring-tum
Phi reporters will do the
necessary research to write
stories that are factually cor-
rect. In this way, the Phi will be
better able to carry out its
legitimate roles of promoting
greater understanding of cam-
pus issues and of stimulating
University-wide discussion and
debate.
Sincerely,
Lewis G. John
Dean of Students

New Rush Outlined

‘Dear Sir:
' In response to last week’s ar-
ticle ‘‘New Rush, Same Prob-
lems”’ I would first like to point
out that the University Council
meeting, where the ‘‘disastrous
decision” was made, was an
open meeting and anyone who
felt strongly about the issue was
-more than welcome to come to
the meeting and express his opi-
nion. Not only would the UC
benefit from any input but I also
feel strongly that the Phi would
also have benefited by coming
to the meeting and getting its
facts straight concerning the
past system and concerning the
proposal that was being made.

1. First of all, the 16 W&L
fraternities only ‘‘boast” ap-
proximately 60 percent of the
»W&L student body (Not the 80
percent figure that was
reported).

2. Second, the new proposal
would reduce the length of of-
ficial rush by four days, from
four and one-half weeks to four
weeks as opposed to the six to
four week change that was
reported.

3. The new proposal would not
alter in any way the date that
freshman are allowed to
“tear.” It would, however, give

the fraternities and _ the
freshmen more opportunities
for contact, including six in-
stead of four rush dates, within
this time period.

4. The new proposal also pro-
vides for an open weekend of
rush before open house
registration which should allow
the freshmen to make educated
decisions when deciding which
houses to go to for open houses.

5. The article also accuses the
SAC, the UC, and the IFC of an
“astonishing’’ lack of study. In
light of the fact, is it not the
Ring-tum Phi’s lack of study
that can be termed ‘aston-
ishing?”

Sincerely,
Mason Ellerbe
President-IFC
