by Todd Smith

W&L Biology Professor Gary
H. Dobbs III, 33, shot and killed
himself in his cabin home on the
morning of Dec. 31. His body
was found the next day by
President Robert E. R. Huntley
and three others.

Speaking at Monday’s faculty
meeting, Huntley said that in a
letter Dobbs stated he was un-
satisfied with his personal and
professional achievement and
would take his life.

Dobbs’ remains were cremat-
ed without a service and will be
scattered this afternoon at 5:00
on the front campus by Presi-
dent Huntley.

“In the fall we will have a new
person,”’ said Thomas Nye,
chairman of the Biology depart-
ment.
able to replace what the univer-
sity has lost, what the depart-
ment has lost, and, most of all,

 

“But we will never be

what the students have lost.’

Dobbs, awarded a Ring-tum
Phi award last year for
“epitomizing a  gentleman,”’
was a popular figure on cam-
pus. He had 30 advisees, more
than anyone in the department,
and still had to turn students
away.

Dobbs entered Washington
and Lee as a student in 1966, the
year Nye began teaching here.
‘By the time he was a senior he
was totally devoted to the ideals
and traditions of Washington
and Lee,” said Nye.

Nye and Huntley both said
that no matter how successful
Dobbs was, he could never be
fully satisfied. Huntley stressed
that Dobbs felt this way since
before he entered W&L.

“I believe he carried that
burden as long as I’ve known
him,” said Nye.

“There is no guilt to be

assumed by the faculty, the me
students or the family.”
‘A videotape with a personal

message to each member of the |

(Biology) department for what
they had meant to him” was
left, according to Nye. Dobbs

had been in charge of writing }

guidelines for the department's
new video equipment.

Letters were left for col-
leagues, the Ring-tum Phi, the
president and his father.
Flowers were sent by Dobbs to
secretaries in Washington Hall.

His message to the Ring-tum

Phi included an open letter to 4
his advisees (printed on page |

2);

his mail a letter from Dobbs
postmarked in Lexington Dec.
31. The letter directed Huntley

to find Dobbs’ will in the pro- °

fessor’s office.

S.A.B. Appears Before E.C..

by Ben Jarratt

The Student Activities Board
presented its monthly budget
report, including an estimated
Fancy Dress budget of $55,000,
at the E.C. meeting on Monday
night.

The Executive Committee
also heard reports from the Stu-
dent Emergency Loan Commit-
tee, the Cold Check Committee
and the Computer Club.

“The whole idea of a budget
scares me,’’ stated SAB co-
chairman John Martin. The
SAB can only estimate ex-
penses and past Fancy Dress
Balls have lost money.

Co-chairman Blake Wither-

ington added the SAB spent
$38,000 last year after setting a
budget of $31,000.

Fancy Dress will be held in
Warner Gym, allowing for
larger crowds. Both co-
chairmen said increased ticket
sales should provide extra
revenue.

Fancy Dress will be open to
alumni this year, according to
Martin. The W&L Alumni
Magazine has written an article
about the upcoming ball and the
Alumni House is compiling a
list of alumni over the past ten
years. Martin added over 600
letters will be mailed out about
the Ball. He also expressed in-

 

 

Darrell, S.A.B, Agree On
D-Hall Concert Program

by John Wells

The Student Activities Board
is planning a busy winter term
that will include the ground-
breaking initiative of featuring
musical entertainment in
Evans Dining Hall.

SAB co-chairman John Mar-
tin expresses hope that a Jan. 16
appearance in the dining hall by
a Jamaican reggae band will
open the doors for similar
events in the future. Food Ser-
vices Director Jerry Darrell
has restricted activity there to
Fancy Dress, The Superdance
and the S.A.B.U. Ball due to
damage inflicted by rowdy
students when a band played
there some years ago.

Darrell has given Martin and
Bob Schmidt the go ahead for
the upcoming event due largely
to their success in other
endeavors. It was their popular
“Tuesdays at the Pit’ concert
program that helped pull Dar-
rell’s financially troubled
Cockpit out of the red last fall.

Martin stresses that student
attendance and behavior at the
Evans concert will determine
whether such special events
will be staged there in the
future. Due to Darrell’s concern
that disorderly conduct might
violate a Virginia ABC Board
ordinance, there will be heavy
security at the concert, and

terest in contacting P.M
Magazine about covering the
weekend event.

Witherington said students
will be allowed to bring guests,
but this will probably be limited
to only one guest ticket per stu-
dent.

“It’s a school function,”
stated Witherington. ‘‘The SAB
wants to limit the number of
non-W&L students. Advanced
tickets will cost $25-$30 at the
door.

Martin added the SAB will be
sponsoring a ‘Reggae Party”
Friday, January 15, in Evans
Dining Hall.

“It’s got to be a success,”
stated Martin. ‘‘The dining hall
could be a potential alternative
for concerts.”’

Martin added Gerald Darrell,
director of the dining hall, was
concerned about potentia!
abuse of the hall by students.
Extra security will be added to
prevent any trouble.

Kip Gordon won the SAB
Backgammon Tournament
First prize was a free ski trip
for two to Snowshoe. Martin
also added he was still working
with the Ring-tum Phi over get
ting lower advertising rates.

Eric Kolts reported that the
Student Emergency Loan Com-
mittee gave out eight loans
totaling $1010 just before the
Christmas Break.

‘Most of the students needed
money to go home,”’ said Kolts
One needed to get his car fixed
and another needed money for
gas

REVIEW azd OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Gary Hobson Dobbs III

The passing away of Gary Dobbs is an unfortunate
loss that has left this campus both saddened and
shocked. Dr. Dobbs was a man greatly admired for
both his personal charm and his professional talents.
While he expected the highest standards from his
students, he vowed, above all else, to make himself
available to anyone in need. Few professors can make
the same boast.

Dr. Dobbs’ final choice leaves one bewildered. Why
would a man with so many things apparently in his ~
favor arrive at such a conclusion? The answer, it
seems, is that Gary Dobbs made a choice that ap-
peared sensible to him but for us was unfortunate.

We may never fully understand how the human
mind operates. Likewise, there is no justification for
Gary Dobbs’ decision — it ended the life of a man who
had much to give.

Gary Dobbs provided us with knowledge, dignity
and compassion. For these reasons he will be greatly
missed by all.

Dobbs

(continued from page 1)

Huntley called Dean Watt and
Eric Sisler, University At-
torney, and went to Dobbs’ of-
fice in Parmly Hall. There he
found the will and other per-
sonal documents in careful
order.

Huntley located Dr. William
Old, and went to Dobbs’ home in

many weeks or even months
ago.”’ The will, which has yet to
be made public, names the
university as executor.

Dobbs stipulated that the
W&L make no official state-
ment nor hold any type of
memorial service. Huntley has
expressed his desire to comply
with this wish and the news of-

“He was such an articulate spokesman

for the teaching profession and the
way Washington and Lee tries
to work with its students.”’

 

 

Ben Salem Cabin, with Watt
and Sisler. Breaking down the
door, they found Dobbs dead of
a wound inflicted by a_ .38-
caliber pistol.

It was estimated that Dobbs
shot himself between 3 and 4
a.m. on Dec. 31.

Dobbs was: examined by Dr.
F.A. Feddeman and taken to
the Harrison Funeral Home.

The will was dated Dec. 17,
and Huntley told the faculty
that ‘from these documents
and other circumstances, it is
clear that Dr. Dobbs’ prepara-
tions for his own death began

fice issued no releases on the
situation.

The amount of his bequest to
the university will be released
when the will becomes probate.

Dobbs is survived by his
sister and his father, who lives

- in Birmingham, Ala. The two

will be in Lexington this after-
noon for the distribution of
Dobbs’ ashes.

Dobbs was bern in Birm-
ingham in 1948. He graduated
from Washington and Lee with
a B.S. in biology and the highest
grade point average in his

class. He was a member of the .

Sigma Chi social fraternity, the
freshman honor society and Phi
Beta Kappa.

Dobbs earned his Ph.D. at the
University of Calfornia at San
Diego. He did further graduate
work at the University of
Chicago and Duke Medical
School.

Though still a young man,
Dobbs had published three of
his own articles and co-
authored six more.

Dobbs was granted tenure
last year as an associate pro-
fessor and became eligible to
take a sabbatical. He declined
it.

Dobbs’ eagerly participated
in special conferences and
alumni workshops. He greeted
incoming freshmen, and ad-
dressed the class of ’83 during
its freshman orientation. He
spoke at last year’s senior ban-
quet.

“We called on him several
times and he was always
delightful,” said Frank Par-
sons, Assistant to the President.
“He was such an articulate
spokesman for the teaching pro-
fession and the way Washington

and Lee tries to work with its |

students.”

D.C. Applications Sought

Applications are invited for
the positions of Freshman Dor-
mitory Counselors for the
1982-83 academic year. These
positions are among the most
responsible entrusted to
Washington and Lee students.

On the basis of past ex-
perience, certain guidelines for
the selection of Dormitory
Counselors have been establish-
ed. Applicants must be at least

current sophomores, and should
not have commitments after
8:00 p.m. which would routinely
take them away from the dor-
mitory for any appreciable
time. While counselorships are
not awarded on an academic
basis, a student who has failed
to maintain a 2.0 average would
probably not be selected. Any
counselor who is placed on

Two Matches Scheduled

 

Wrestlers To Visit N.Carolina

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team will take its 1-1
record to North Carolina this
weekend for matches with
Campbell College Friday and
Duke Saturday.

On Friday, January’ 8 the
Generals will visit Buies Creek
to face Campbell University. On’
Saturday, Jan. 9 the team will
be in Durham for a contest with
Duke University.

“Along with VMI, whom we ,.

faced back in December, these
are the toughest opponents on
the schedule,’’ comments ninth-
year head coach Gary Franke
on the foes, both of which are
members of the NCAA Division
| category while the Generals

belong to Division III. ‘We %

compete against these teams on
a regular basis, taking on Duke
ina dual match each season and
having Campbell come to our
Invitationals.”’

Coach Gary Franke and
Sophomore Captain Tim
Valliere are encouraged by the
Generals’ start and believe that
the team’s 10 freshmen will be
able to make a contribution.
Said Valliere, ‘“‘They’ve been
here for a whole term and
should be familiar with the pro-
gram by now.”

As for the upcoming matches,
Franke said ‘I hope we can
match up in the lower weight
divisions.” Most of the starting
spots in 118 to 150 pound classes

 

are held by the freshmen.

‘I'ne Generals will take a 1-1
record into the trip, the results
being a 42-8 win over Lynchburg
College and a 25-14 loss to VMI.
The Duke and Campbell con-
tests are two of 11 total dual
matches for W&L this season.

W&L’s line-up for the trip is
complete with the exception of
the 167-pound class, which
Franke says will be finalized

John Cleghorn

 

Over the Christmas break
most of us had more than our
fill of football. Almost every
other day of the holiday we
were treated to some bowl
game featuring two teams that
we know almost nothing about.
| Most of these games are mean-
ingless in the final standings but
are intended to give the players
and coaches some type of
honor. One has to wonder what
kind of honor it is to have to
practice for a month after the
season and be away from your
family and friends during the
holiday for one game.

Realistically, there are four
or five important bowls that
have bearing on the final stan-
‘dings and the determination of
,the national champion. Iron-
‘ically, all these bowls take
| place on the same day and what
some college teams have work-
_ed for virtually the year round
_is decided within a matter of
hours. Maybe they had a better
idea in 1951.

In 1951, one of the earliest
years of the national college
football poll, there were only
four bowls after the regular
season, the Orange, Rose,
Gator, and, Sugar bowls. In that
same season the Washington
and Lee Generals compiled an
8-2 season and, as a participant
in major college competition,
were ranked as high as thir-
teenth in the nation.

 

W&L greats as Joe McCutch-
eon, Jim Stark and the
‘General of the Generals” Gil
'Bocetti, an option quarterback
heralded as ‘‘the master of the
fake and the pitchout.’’ At the
end of the 1951 season, after
playing Maryland, North
Carolina, Virginia Tech, and
Florida among others, the
Generals had only fallen to
number one ranked Tennessee
and highly ranked University of
Virginia. This impressive per-
formance earned the Generals
an invitation to the Gator Bowl.

 

These were the days of such

Bowled Over At

Christmas Time

The game pitched an
underated W&L team against
an undefeated Wyoming squad,
one of the three most im-
pressive teams in the country.
Wyoming brought a threatening
running attack with Vern Gale,
a wingback, Eddie Talboom, a
triple threat all-American
tailback, and an all-conference
blocking back Dick Campbell.

A major break for Wyoming
was the timely arrival of appen-
dicitis for W&L leader Walt
Michaels now head coach of the
New York Jets. Michaels, a
player of double worth for his”
work as a fullback and line-
backer, came down with appen-
dicitis only twenty-four hours
before the game in Jackson-
ville. That loss proved to be
critical for the Generals.

A crowd of 26,000 fans, 5,000
from W&L, attended the New
Year’s day game billed as ‘‘the
battle between the West and the
South.”” The cowboys of Wyom-
ing struck with two touchdowns
in the second quarter and
another in the third. The
Generals could only muster a
late fourth quarter touchdown
as the game ended in a 20-7 vic-
tory and a perfect season for
Wyoming.

Athletic Director Bill
McHenry, then a member of the
W&L freshmen squad, remem-
bers that game as one of the last
great games in that era of

_Generals football. W&L drop-

ped from major college com-
petition in 1953 and has since
become a member of NCAA
division three competition.

Nowadays in the light of such
subspecies as the tangerine and
peach bowls and_ other
honorable events such as the
astro-bluebonnet bowl
(whatever an astro bluebonnet
is), a bowl invitation is not such
a respected thing. Maybe they
had a better idea in 1951.

cond half as the Washington and
Lee basketball team evened
their record at 3-3 with a 62-53
victory over Swarthmore Col-
lege Tuesday night.

The Generals had the lead at
the half by a count of 23-18, but
Swarthmore, playing an ag-
gressive defense, came back to
take a 26-24 lead with 14:45 left
in the game. Hanson, who led
the Generals with 16 points, hit

a jumper from the left side and
a bank shot to give W&L a two

point lead.
Following Swarthmore’s Ron
Bradley’s . third consecutive

basket to knot the score at 28 for

the final time, Graves con-
nected on four straight free
throws to give W&L the lead
that they would never relin-
quish.

Swarthmore had kept the
game close through the first
half by playing a patient of-
fense, taking only wide open
shots. This way, they managed
to jump out to a 4-0 lead, but the
Generals came back and quick-
ly tied the score at six.

Washington and Lee was also
helped by two technicals called
on the Swarthmore coaching
staff as Graves, who finished
with 15 points, hit on all four of

the foul shots.
The game was all but sealed

for W&L when Graves hit
from the left side, was fouled,

General Facts

The Washington and Lee
basketball team will host
Haverford (Pa.) College and
Bethany (W.Va.) College this
weekend in the 13th annual
W&L Invitational. Those two
teams will square off at 7:30
tonight, with the loser meeting
W&L at 7:30 tomorrow night
and the winner at 7:30 on Satur-
day night in the round-robin af-
fair.

Haverford brings a 5-4 record
and the nation’s leading defense
(45.2 points per game) into the
tourney while Bethany was 3-2
prior toa Tuesday game versus
Denison College of Ohio.

The 0.D.A.C., in cooperation
with the N.C.A.A., will experi-
ment this winter by opening all
conference basketball games
with an in-bounds pass instead
of the common jump ball. Vis-
iting team captains will have
the choice of first possession or
defense of a particular basket.
After the initial in-bounds pass,
possession in jump ball situa-
tions will be awarded on an
alternating basis. (NOTE: In
case of overtime contests, a
jump ball will be used to open
each overtime period.) In addi-
tion to oonference games,

this experimental procedure
with those non-conference op-
ponents who agree to such use.

Also in ODAC news a resolu-
tion was made in reference to
two instances of post graduate
competitors in conference com-
petition. A motion was made
and a second received that non-
students or those students with-
out athletic eligibility by NCAA
or ODAC standards may not
compete in any intercollegiate
athletic event. Motion received
unanimous adoption.

~ Nine of the twelve teams that
compete at Washington and Lee
have winning records from
their first season to date. The
total won-loss record as of this
fall is 3681-3333-138. The oldest
team on campus is the football
squad which started competi-
tion in 1873. The most recent ad-
dition is the lacrosse team
which debued in 1977.

The selection committee that
named 1958 W&L Cager Stand-

‘out to an all-American team

showed great insight. What
makes the story surprising is
that among his all-American
teammates were Oscar Robert-
son, Elgin Baylor, Bob Boozier,
and Wilt Chamberlin.

 

 

    
   
     
     
 

 

  

but missed the free throw.
However, sophomore Chris
Baldwin pulled down the re-
bound and fired around the
court to Graves, who made the
hoop from the same location as
he had only seconds before.
This gave the Generals a 46-37
lead with only 6:30 remaining.

Despite Graves’ fouling out
with 3:51 left, W&L clinched the
victory by sinking eight of their
last 11 shots from the charity
stripe. For the game, they hit 22
of 28 (78.6%) from the line and
20 of 36 (55.5%) from the floor.
The Generals had been ranked
third in shooting percentage
and fifth in free throw percen-
tage in the nation entering the
contest.

However, one of the con-
tributors to those statistics,
sophomore guard Henry Bond,
failed to meet the academic
guidelines required by the
university and was subsequent-
ly dismissed. Bond, who had
started the Generals last game
against Allegheny College, was
averaging 10.8 points per game
and was hitting on 72% of his
shots. Billy Yates, who scored
five points Tuesday night, is
replacing him in the lineup.

The team had closed out their
pre-vacation portion of the
schedule by downing Allegheny
College 67-62 on Dec. 9. In that
matchup, junior reserve for-
ward Jay Fechtel only scored
four points, but they were
perhaps the most crucial of the
game for W&L. With 6:28 left in
the game, Allegheny, who had

trailed by nine, 33-24, at the
half, took the lead 54-53.
However, Fechtel first tapped
in a George Spears shot that
was off the mark and then hit a
shot himself to give the
Generals a 57-54 lead with only
3:40 remaining in the game.
Allegheny pulled within one at
57-56, but Graves, who scored 18
points and led the team with ten
rebounds, hit two free throws to
ice the game.

Hanson led the squad with 20
points, and he also pulled down

points, including an 8-11 perfor-
mance from the foul line.

Head Coach Verne Canfield
said the win over Allegheny
“cured a lot of ills as it showed
the team is gaining character.”
He was still lamenting over the
number of turnovers (19) that
his team had committed and
also their poor execution on of-
fense several times down the
floor.

Review:

A Poorly-Tuned ‘Sharkey’s Machine’

by Todd Jones
Sharkey’s Machine is_ the
latest’ Burt Reynolds film.

Reynolds also directs this
movie, which is very poor.

Burt plays a cop who ‘‘nobody
owns.’’ After chasing down a
drug dealer who kills a bus
driver, Reynolds is transferred
from narcotics to the vice

squad. While investigating

some high-class hookers,

Reynolds discovers that the
next governor of the state
employs one of them. Since
Reynolds is such a good cop
(not to mention star and direc-
tor of the film), he asks for a 24-
hour surveillance of the most
attractive hooker, a woman
named Dominoe, and naturally
gets it. To no one’s surprise, he
falls in love with her, after tak-
ing pictures of her day and
night.

 

 

Roomful of Blues, the jazzy group who wowed 'em in The Cockpit
(Marvin’s Garden) during last year’s Fancy Dress Ball, return
with their classy act Tuesday night in the Cockpit. The group is part
of the SAB’s ‘‘Tuesdays in the Pit” series of concerts which began
last term.

We soon discover that the
governor-to-be is backed by a
mafioso chief who owns the
hooker. The mafioso chief
decides that the girl is no good,
so after one last evening with
her, he orders his brother to
blow her up with a gun that
resembles a hand-cannon. The
brother, high on seventeen dif-
ferent drugs, accidentally
blows away the wrong girl, not
to mention half a door. The real
hooker ends up at Burt’s house
and, as the violins swell and the
lighting dims, in Burt’s arms.
However, Burt poignantly

by John Wells

Citizen Kane (1941) Often and deservedly cited as the finest
American film, Orson Welles’ brilliant study in power and corrup-
tion is as entertaining as any great movie deserves to be. It’s
technical advances dramatically altered the look of American
films for years to come. The subject matter was blatantly and scan-
dalously lifted from the life of newspaper baron W.R. Hearst,
operating quite a stir at the time. The editing and acting are fan-
tastic, with performances by Welles, Joseph -Cotten, Everett
Sloane, Ray Collins, Ruth Warrick, Agnes Moorehead and Dorothy

W&L Receives $135,000 Donation
To Support Anthropology Reasearch

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has established an endowed
program to support student
research in anthropology as the
result of three anonymous gifts
made to the university.

The gifts, totaling $135,000,
have enabled the university to
establish an endowment to fund
the Leyburn Scholars Program
in Anthropology. The program
is named in honor of Dr. James
G. Leyburn, former dean of the
college.

The Leyburn Scholars Pro-
gram is designed to further the
study and research in an-
thropology at W&L by enabling
the university to provide
stipends for students engaging
in that research. Funds from
the endowment may also be us-
ed for the purchase of equip-
ment and for the support of

publication of reports on the
research.

Among his many contribu-
tions to Washington and Lee,
Leyburn was instrumental in
the development of teaching
and research in anthropology at
the university.

Responding to the establish-
ment of the endowment pro-
gram in his name, Leyburn
said: ‘‘The pursuit of excellence
among its students and the en-
couragement of their scholar-
ship are among the primary
purposes of a university, It
pleases me greatly to know that
students in anthropology,
thanks to the Scholars Pro-
gram, will now have both the in-
centive and the means to do
scholarly research.”’

Leyburn retired from active
teaching at W&L in 1972, He was

people, but I don’t have a thou-
sand dollars’’ (the hooker’s go-
ing rate). Eventually things get
hot for Burt, who still pushes
forward and eventually gets all
the bad guys. :

If you enjoy watching person
after person getting pumped
with lead, this movie is for you.
Someone is shot every seven
minutes in the film by every
type of gun imaginable, in-
cluding a harpoon gun. I would
be hesitant to be Sharky’s next
partner, for every person he
works with in the film ends up
lying on the floor with eight or
nine bullets in him.

Also featured in the film are
Earl Holloman, who plays the
governor-elect; Vittorio
Gassman, the mafioso chief;
and Rachel Ward, the hooker.
Charles Durning plays a vice-
squad chief who is more con-
cerned with his retirement than
with catching criminals. Also in
the film is Brian Keith, who
plays an old cop. We are told
that he could “‘wrestle a train,”

but he spends his screen time
ambling around with food in his
hands. It’s hard picturing ‘‘Un-
cle Bill’’ constantly stuffing
food in his face, making crude
jokes about hookers, and using
“nasty language.” Really, what
would Buffy and Jody think?

Sharkey’s Machine is a film
with little plot and even less
entertainment. All Reynolds
does is run through the film be-
ing a peeping tom, shooting up
people, and losing fingers. Burt
uses witty phrases like ‘‘I’ve got
your ass in my hand” and
““You’re a piece of s--t in a
toilet, and I’m going to flush
you!” With witty statements
like that, he endears himself to
a $1000-a-night hooker, but to no
one else, especially not the au-
dience.

While the film might be enter-
tainment to total Burt Reynolds
freaks or sadists, I’m trying to
forget this movie and think
about Burt’s upcoming film The
Best Little Whorehouse in Tex-
as, It has to be better than
Sharkey’s Machine.

E.C. secretary Bennett Ross
asked how many loans were
committee approved. Kolts
replied he gave out two and the
committee approved six.

He added his committee may
advertize about student loans in
the school newspaper, but he
did not want students to take ad-
vantage of the program.

Randall Jacoby reported the
Cold Check Committee has
picked up 102 bad checks since
its last report. Of these checks
71 are still outstanding.

Jacoby added that about $200
worth of the checks belong to
graduated students. He thought
the committee would write

these checks off as a loss.

E.C. president Eric Myers
said the committee should
notify the Registrar’s Office of
these debts and have the
transcripts held up. This has
proven to be an effective way of
collecting money for bounced
checks.

Jacoby replied he was not
aware of this policy and would
have his committee consider it.

Myers also recommended
that some form of legal letter be
sent to the alumni notifying
them of their debt.

says that tickets sold at the door
will cease as soon as the 600th is
purchased.

Martin emphasizes that stu-
dent support will be crucial to
open ‘‘new facets of entertain-
ment” at the university in a
variety of musical styles.

Variety, preached and prac-
ticed by Martin’s predecessor
Jamie Small, is evident in
bands scheduled to appear each
Tuesday night in the Cockpit
throughout the term. The new
season was inaugurated with a
performance by The Movies on
Tuesday night. Future bands in-
clude Roomful of Blues, a
popular feature at last year’s
Fancy Dress, on Jan. 12; The
Showmen, a soul band slated for
Jan. 19; Virginia Fire on Jan.
27; Steve Bassett and the
Virginia Breeze on Feb. 2:
Brice Street on Feb. 23; Billy
Price and the Keystone Rhythm
Band on March 2; Little Big
Band on March 9; The Motive
on March 16; and another reg-
gae band called Hooters on
March 23.

Non-Tuesday' night ap-
pearances' scheduled for
February include the Alabama-
based Telluride on the 5th and
The Deal, a ‘‘hot new band”’
from Charlottesville, on the
27th.

Martin and Schmidt are at-
tempting to maintain estab-

lished and high quality bands
while diversifying, i.e. the soul
bands, to appeal to a larger au-
dience. As it is, he feels, the
Cockpit is getting the same
turnover week after week. He is
also seeking increased publicity
for the groups who do appear in
order to increase student in-
terest.

Other upcoming events in-
clude the weekly SAB film
series, the lacrosse team’s an-
nual fund raiser at Zollman’s
Pavilion on Jan. 22, and the
Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance to be held Jan. 29 and 30.
