EC Will.
Examine

Bank Rules

by John Cleghorn

After reviewing a report from
the Cold Check Committee, the
Executive Committee moved to
begin informing incoming
freshmen about local banks’
policies towards bounced
checks in a short meeting Mon-
day night.

In other business the E.C.
commended the editors and
staff of the Washington and Lee
Political Review on its first
publication and also froze the
finances of the Fencing Club,
the Computer Club, and the Stu-
dent Emergency Loan Commit-
tee until their monthly reports
are heard.

Upon inquiry from senior
Law Rep. Morgan Griffith
about students’ awareness of
local banks’ penalties for cold
checks, Cold Check Committee
Treasurer Randall Jacoby
replied that many freshmen are
ignorant of the workings of a
checking account.

“‘T think it would be helpful to
freshmen in understanding
each bank’s policy. They don’t
understand that they have to
pay the banks as a penalty,”’
Jacoby commented.

Senior Rep. Ken Lang then
moved that a policy statement
be included in the package for
incoming freshmen. Executive
Committee Secretary Bennett
Ross remarked that cold checks
are a matter concerning the
bank and the student and that

responsibility lies with the bank“

to inform the freshmen. After a
short explanation by Griffith,
E.C. President Eric Myers sug-
gested that the banks be ap-
proached about the matter.

Senior Rep. Tripp Brower
asked Jacoby if there were
many second offenders. Jacoby
responded that there were only
a few and added that no revision
needed to be made in the cold
check policy.

Eric Myers remarked, “I
think it’s great,” referring to
the first issue of the Washington
and Lee Political Review.

W&L Applications Set New Record

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity received a record number
of applications for admission to
the university this year, accord-
ing to admissions officials.

As of April 2, Washington and
Lee’s office of admissions had
processed 1,602 applications
from prospective students.
Before this year, the largest
number of applications had
been in 1965 when the university
received 1,599 applications.

The total of 1,602 applications
represents a 17 percent in-
crease over a year ago when the
university processed 1,369 ap-
plications.

William M. Hartog, director
of admissions at W&L, said the
university has offered admis-
sion to 765 (or 48 percent) of the
applicants. The university
plans to enroll a freshman class
of between 350 and 365 students
this fall.

Hartog added that the univer- ~

sity has a ‘‘significantly
stronger pool of acceptances”’
in terms of academic quality as
measured both by achievement
and aptitude test scores and by

_ daily academic records.

The average class standing
among students who were ad-
mitted is higher than a year
ago, said Hartog. The average
class standing for those offered
admission is in the 82nd percen-

       
   

tile.

The mean Scholastic Aptitude
Test scores are up 20 points
from a year ago to 564 verbal
and 611 mathematics. In addi-
tion, the students accepted this
year have scored 17. points
higher on the English achieve-
ment test than last year.

“To date, we have named 12
National Merit Scholars and an-

William M. Hartog: ‘‘a significantly stronger pool of acceptances.”

ticipate that between 25 and 30
will be named in all,’’ Hartog
said.

Of the students accepted for
admission at Washington and
Lee, 60 percent are attending
public high schools while 40 per-
cent are attending private high
schools. Forty-four states are
represented among the 765
students offered admission.

IFC Again
Considers

New Rush

By Scott Mason

The Inter-Fraternity Council,
Tuesday night, resumed its tus-
sle over the continuing debate
of ‘‘deferred rush,” a subject
which has drawn the interests
of the University Council and
Student Affairs Committee and
Executive Committee.

Dean Dan Murphy, assistant
dean of students for fraternity
affairs, indicated the sugges-
tions were made at the Student

‘Affairs Committee meeting
held just prior to Spring break.
Those proposals concerned in-
tensifying a shortened first
semester rush which would be
proceded by an extensive orien-
tation period for all freshmen.
In addition to greater open con-
tact between freshmen and
fraternity members, this inten-
sive early rush would, it is

Will Sigma Nu
Come Back?....p.3

 

hoped, relieve much of the
monotony which many believe
afflicts the present system.
Murphy said that the Student
Affairs Committee finds it
favorable to “get it (rush) over
with’’ as soon as possible, and
that these changes would allow
that quick termination.

The IFC itself is taking no fur-
ther action on any possible
changes with the rush system
until after hearing the results of
the next Student Affairs Com-
mittee meeting which will take
place on April 29. A general
solution is expected to be made
concerning next year’s rush at
that meeting. /

Other factors which weigh
considerably on any final deci-
sion entail the financial burden
placed upon the fraterntities
during rush, as well as the
academic burden on freshmen
and all students. However,
time, perhaps, is the greatest
obstacle in solving the deferred
rush issue. With just over a
month remaining in the
academic year, a decision must
be finalized soon.

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Single Sanction

The letter found at the bottom of this page deals
with a rather touchy subject — the single sanction
policy of the Washington and Lee honor system. Opin-
ions on the single sanction rule run in either direction.
Those who believe in it — the belief that a person gets
only one choice if convicted of an honor offense _
— claim that single sanction serves as a deterrent of*
sorts for would-be honor abusers. Threaten the people
with involuntary expulsion, they argue, and no one
will cheat. But those who disagree with single sanc-
tion state that sometimes we should forgive our fellow
students for honor violations and permit them to re-'
main in the community.

Obviously, the single sanction rule 1s a complicatea
matter. While automatic expulsion does seem an ef-
fective deterrent for cheaters, it is also frightening to
consider the consequences of convicting a person on a
questionable honor offense. But under the system at
Washington and Lee, we theoretically give the stu-
dent at least one fair hearing — the option for a se-
cond hearing is also possible. This,in theory, should
guarantee defendents of a fair hearing.

Over the past few years, there seems to have been
an increase in the amount of students going public
with their honor trials. Whether this is a reflection of
students questioning the effectiveness of the Ex-
ecutive Committee to conduct a private honor hear-
ing, or whether it reflects students enjoying a
democratic process, we are not really sure. Of one
thing we are sure, however. When discussing the
single sanction rule, it is best not to either simply ad-

-vocate or lampoon it. The matter is too complicated to
try and place under narrow limitations.

Sunday, April 25, matks the
first International Day at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty. The event will be sponsored
by the Washington and Lee In-
ternational Club.

First on the agenda for Sun-
day is a Chinese Opera perfor-
mance at the Unviersity
Theatre. The pertérmance
starts at 3 p.m. and reserva-
tions can be made by calling.
463-9111, ext. 299. Chinese opera
is a traditional type of drama
and, as a rule, follows a folklore
theme. Professor I-Hsiung Ju of
the art department was in-
strumental in bringing the
opera to the W&L campus. The
opera will be the first of its Kind’
at Washington and Lee, and is a

rare opportunity to witness an
ancient Chinese art form.

The opera will be performed
by the Chinese Opera Society of
Washington, D.C. The perfor-
mance is entitled ‘“‘The White
Serpent’” and tells of a woman
who turns into a serpent and the
man who falls in love with her
not knowing she is a snake.

The opera will be followed by
an ‘International Dinner” to be
served at Evans Dining Hall.
The dinner will be served from
5:30-6:30 p.m. and will cost $5
for non-contract students.

Following the dinner, a slide
lecture will be presented in the
University Library’s Northen
Auditorium at 8 p.m. The lec-
ture is entitled ‘On the Road in

China, November 1981 - March,
1982: a Historian’s Observa-
tions.” The lecture will be given
by Dr. Roger B. Jeans, a W&L
professor of history. A recep-
tion will follow with interna-
tional hors d’oeuvres being
served.

The club is also presenting an
International Children’s Art
Exhibit. The exhibit will be on
display from April 25-30 in the
University Library’s Lower
Level One lobby.

Henry Baey, president of the
club, commented that ‘‘the day
will hopefully provide some
awareness of different natures
and cultures. We hope many
students will be able to attend.
If it turns out well, we hope to
make it an annual event.”’

W&L Opens Up To Summer Scholars

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will offer .a.month-long co-
educational program designed
to give college-bound high
school students the opportunity
to sample college life again this
summer,

“Summer Scholars 82”” will .
be held July 4 through July 30 on
the Washington and Lee cam-
pus in Lexington.

This is the second summer in

a row Washington and Lee has
conducted the program that in-
volves a rigorous, college-level
academic curriculum for
students who will be seniors in
high school this fall.

Dr. John F. DeVogt, pro-
fessor of administration at
W&L, is the director of the pro-
gram.

During the four-week period,
participants will take two

academic courses that they
choose from among 12 offer-
ings. The courses include such
topics as ‘Battles and Leaders
of the Civil War,” ‘Current
Concepts in Biology,’’ ‘‘Infla-
tion,” “Effective Writing,’ and
“The Media, The Law and
Society.”’

Applications should be made
by May 1.

Single Sanction Policy Questioned

Dear Sir:

Having a few minutes to
spare, I sat down at my desk
this morning to read a while
from a copy of Excelsior, the
newly established journal of
FOCUS. The first article I read
was ‘‘Honor and Will’ by John
Vlahoplus and, while I con-
tinued reading other articles, in

_ the back of my mind was the
desire to respond to John’s let-
ter, and thus this letter.

The article deals with the
honor system at Washington
and Lee and supports the
necessity of continuing a single
sanction system. If a student is
found guilty of an honor offense,
this system requires him to
sever his relationship with the
university. John states that
“honor cannot be measured by
degree’”’ because such a position
would make honor a relative
pursuit. On the contrary, John
believes very clearly that honor
“cannot exist beside dishonor”
and that the tolerance of even
the most insignificant act of
dishonor would jeopardize the
entire system of trust which we
enjoy as Washington and Lee
gentlemen.

While I have the greatest
respect for John, I cannot help
but object to the unbending
principle which he espouses. As
much as it pains me to admit
the fact, I have suffered from
that “failure of will’? which
John identifies as the root of
dishonorable action. A case in
point comes to mind that, while
not having occured at Wash-
ington and Lee, I think may pro-
ve helpful in illustrating my

position.

Some five or six years ago I
was visiting my grandparents
on their in Southern Virginia.
One morning my Grandmother
gave me the keys to her car and
asked me to pull it out of the
garage for her in order to fill the
gasoline tank. Unfortunately, I
was so intent on looking over
my shoulder that I neglected
the front of the car while back-
ing up and ended by smashing
the front fender against the side
of the garage. Well, needless to
say, I was in a state of shock
and terror at what I had done
and was sure that punishment
would be swift and severe. On
the contrary, my Grandmother
upon discovering what occured
comforted me and told me to
simply let it pass. She even
made me promise that I would
not call home and tell my
parents what I had done.

That may have been the end
of the incident, however I con-
tinued to feel badly at having
damaged my Grandparent’s
property. The next day, I
telephoned my parents and told
them (what I had been think-
ing) that they could pay for the
damage and | in turn could
repay them. Of course, my
Grandmother quickly found out
that I had broken my promise to
her and was not a little displeas-
ed. But what did she do?

She could have made me
leave the farm never to return
because I had lied to her, had
violated her honor. Instead, she
again forgave me and com-
forted me. I have never again
even told a “white lie” to my
Grandmother and since that
harrowing episode have en-

joyed many fine days on the
farm. I committed an act of
dishonor against my Grand-
mother, but instead of
banishing me from her sight,
she acted upon General Lee’s
admonition that a gentleman,
or gentlewoman, ‘‘Can not only
forgive, he can forget.”’

The Christian scriptures tell
us that when Peter inquired un-
to Jesus how many times he
must forgive his brother, Jesus
replied ‘‘seventy times seven’’
(Matthew 18:22). My Grand-
mother forgave me and while I
am certainly a humbler man for
having sinned against her, I

 

also believe that I am a
stronger man for having
forgiven and loved.

John said that “honor cannot
exist beside dishonor.”” When I
embrace my forgiving Grand-
mother, I greatly wonder of this
is the case. To be permanently
ostracized, albeit privately,
from any community for a
weakness of willl is a terrible
punishment. It is a punishment
that I am not so sure that we as
gentlemen can or should exer-
cise.

Sincerely,
Keith E. Goretzka ’83

 

 

 

 
 

Cadets from the combined Ar-
my ROTC programs of Wash-
ington and Lee University and
Lynchburg College trained
under sub-freezing conditions in
late March with the Tactics
Committee, 80th Training Com-
mand of Virginia’s 80th, ‘‘Blue
Ridge’”’ Division. The exercise,
part of the continuing series of
W&L’s Total Army training ef-
forts, involved cadets, Army
Reservists, Regular Army
cadre, Army National Guard
training support, and DA
civilians at the Fort Pickett, VA
training site. The FTX,
ominously code named ‘‘Winter
Storm,’’ involved several
phases of training. Even the
logistical and administrative
aspects of the venture served to
educate basic program cadets
who had never before lived in
military barracks, observed the
requirements of a_ training
schedule and weapons security,
or partaken of Army ‘‘chow.”’

The actual training com-
menced on Saturday, March 27,
at 4:30 a.m. when the entire
contingent of 60 cadets formed
for cadre-led physical condi-
tioning. After calesthentics, a
two mile run, and clean up, the
now awake cadets filed into the
80th’s field dining facility for
breakfast. By 0730, twelve M113
armored personnel carriers
(APC’s) had transported the
cadets to a field location where
they commenced training under
| the veteran USAR instructors.

Cleveland

Gaines Cleveland, a second-
year law student at Washington
and Lee University from Gulf-
port, Miss., has been named
editor-in-chief of the
“Washington and Lee Law
Review’? for the 1982-83
academic year.

The editorial board selected
Cleveland and other members
of the 1982-83 staff last week. All
are second-year students in the
School of Law at W&L.

Exercises Conducted

Squads of cadets rotated
through training stations which
included individual tactical
skills, movement techniques,
mechanized infantry squad
drills, and even some tracked
vehicle maintenance _instruc-
tion. All of this was in prepara-
tion for the main events: night
and day operations by a
mechanized infantry unit, per-
forming attacks and defense.

W&L’s Cadet Ranger element
mounted its APC and “‘led the
way”’ for the force which would
conduct delay and defensive
operations. After the five tracks
of the defenders had rumbled
off, the attacking cadets
mounted their vehicles and pro-
ceeded into ‘enemy territory.”
The engagement was _ punc-
tuated with mounted and dis-
mounted ambushes and fire-
fights, attempts at bypass and
envelopment, and sharp skir-
mishes employing fire and
movement by both sides. The
staccato bursts of automatic
weapons, explosive simulators,
smoke grenades, and the whine
and roar of the vehicle engines
all added to the realism.

The final phase of the
weekend’s training on Sunday
was a practical one in which
teams of cadets cleaned and
cleared billets, cleaned rifles
and machine guns, and learned

Basing his optimism on what
he calls ‘‘triad’’ of support, Cap-
tain Charles Hill, the faculty ad-
viser of the Lambda chapter of
Sigma Nu, hopes that the frater-
nity will be reestablished before
the former members graduate,
a goal that he says is rarely ac-
complished among fallen
fraternities.

The “‘triad,”’ which Capt. Hill
speaks of is made up of
assistance from the University,
the National chapter, and the
generosity of Sigma Nu alumni.

“The University gives the
fraternities just enough rope to
either pull themselves up or
hang themselves,’’ maintains
Hill in describing the latitude of
respect between the school and
the fraternities which Hill says
has been fundamental in the
reorganization of the fraternity.

Other assistance has come
from a major fund drive by the
alumni which is raising money
to repair damage to the house
outside of the November fire.
Hill is optimistic that the na-
tional chapter insurance will
pay for the fire damage which is
just under $25,000. The present
stipulation is that no one will
live in the house until the
damage is repaired.

Currently a recruiting team
from the national chapter here
in Lexington is interviewing
students who are interested in

Shakespeare Company,
studying French grammar in
the shadow of the Cathedral of
Notre Dame.

All that — and more — will oc-
cur as part of Washington and
Lee’s series of spring term
abroad programs.

In all, five different groups of
W&L students will be in Europe
this month and next.

The first university group on
the continent will be Wash-
ington: and Lee’s Glee Club,
which left Saturday (April 10)
for a nine-day tour of Germany.

The 35-member Glee Club,
directed by Gordon Spice, per-
formed three concerts during
the tour, appearing at the
Catholic University of
Eichstatt, the Schlosskirche
(Royal Church in the Old Cas-
tle) near Bayreuth, and the
University of Bamberg.

In addition, Glee Club
members visited Munich and
Wurzburg during the visit.

Four Washington and Lee
professors will be taking stu-
dent groups to Europe for
studies as part of the universi-
ty’s six-week spring term
abroad programs.

George Ray, professor of
English, and eight W&L
students will be in England,
where they will concentrate
their studies on British drama

the six weeks will be spent in
London. Students will live in a
bed-and-breakfast hotel within
walking distance of the Univer-
sity of London, University Col-
lege of London, and the West
End theatre district. In addition
to regularly-scheduled semi-
nars, the students will see
numerous plays, including
several by the Royal Shakes-
peare Company during their
Stay.

Two of the six weeks will be
spent touring by mini-bus in
various parts of England, Wales
and Scotland.

Robert Youngblood, associate
professor of German, will have
12 students in Germany during
the spring term. Headquartered
in Bayreuth where they will live
in homes with German families,
the students will receive in-
struction in Germany from both
Dr. Youngblood and members
of the University of Bayreuth
faculty.

G. Francis Drake, professor
of romance languages and 11
students will spend the spring
term in France. The students
will live-in private homes in
Paris and will attend classes in
French, contemporary French
theatre, and contemporary
French art.

C. Westbrook Barritt, pro-
fessor of romance languages,
will have eight students in Spain
for the spring term. The
students will attend classes five
days a week in Madrid where
they will live in private homes.

Improving Netters
Face ‘Challenge’

by David Stuart

“We played as well as we
could,’”’ said Washington and
Lee tennis coach Gary Franke
of his team’s effort on last
week’s Florida road trip.

The team won two matches
against Eckerd (8-1) and Stet-
son (5-4) Colleges but dropped
three matches to Emory (6-3),
University of Central Florida
(9-0) and Rollins (9-0). The
team has never beaten Emory
but has always played them im-
mediately following exams.

In a match Tuesday against
Virginia Tech in Blacksburg,
the Generals took two matches
by default but it wasn’t enough
as they lost 7-2. The match was
played on fast-paced indoor
courts that VPI used to their ad-
vantage. Franke said the
Hokies’ ‘‘kicking serves’’ on the
fast courts gave the varsity ad-
ded problems in adjusting to the
new surface.

The team’s record is now 6-13,
but all of the losses, except that
to Emory, have been to Division
I or Division II teams. The im-
portant matches to decide the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference ranking have yet to be
played. The squad will face a
tough Hampden-Sydney squad
today and Lynchburg Friday on
the road.

Franke said that Hampden-
Sydney and Lynchburg are a
“real challenge’ and ‘‘we need
to be on the top of our game”’ to
beat both teams. Improvement,
rather than just wins and
losses, is what Franke
measures progress with, and he
saw it plus a few victories on the
Florida trip.

Baseball Snaps Slump

by Andrew P. Hoppes

The Washington and Lee
baseball team broke out of a
disasterous mid-season slump
last week to win three league
games before losing to
nationally-ranked Lynchburg
on Tuesday.

After losing two games to
Hampden-Sydney and one to
Eastern Mennonite, the
Generals rebounded to destroy ,
Mennonite 17-0 and Maryville
twice, 5-3 and 5-4. While raising
their league record to 4-5 at that
point, W&L played three
straight games without com-
mitting an error and raised
their team batting average 30
points.

In the 7-6 and .4-3 losses to
Hampden-Sydney, the Generals

Golfers 7th At Va. Tech

by B. Scott Tilley

While most of the student
body relaxed over spring break
at home or at the beach, the
Washington and Lee golf team
was facing a tough field in the
Virginia Tech ‘‘Gobbler
Classic’’ in Blacksburg, Va.

Led by seniors Titus Harris
and Jim Kaplan, with 36-hole
scores of 149, the team placed

Virginia (Arlington) Chargers
in Lynchburg. Their first
regular season game will be on
May 29.

A 1962 graduate of Syracuse,
Fallon, who has a 20-20 record
in four years at Washington and
Lee, played with the Minnesota
Vikings for one season and then
spent two years in the Canadian
Football League. Before com-
ing to Lexington, he was an
assistant coach at Princeton for
six years.

Fallon’s contract calls for
him to receive a base salary of
¢2,500 plus 5 percent of the home
gate receipts. There are some
additional attendance and per-
formance incentives in the con-

watt: {

   

seventh out of the 15 teams
entered.

Whit Kelly’s 156, Del Agnew’s —

158, Bruce Blythe’s 161 and Bill
Alfano’s 163 also helped the
strong second-day perfor-
mance, after the Generals were
bogged in tenth place following
the first day.

The Generals had suffered a
two-and-a-half week layoff
since defeating Bluefield Col-
lege to raise their dual match
record to 6-0, and Coach Buck
Leslie felt that this ‘‘hurt the
team in the first round at Tech.
I was really pleased that we
came around the second day.
We shot the second lowest round
the second day, which beat a lot
of Division I teams.”’

The team now heads to
Hampden-Sydney College Mon-
day and Tuesday to compete in
the ODAC tournament at
Wedgewood Country Club in
Farmville.

Coach Leslie sees this year’s
tournament as a free-for-all.
“It’s wide open because nearly
every team has played well and
played fairly even so far this
season. I don’t believe anyone
will be able to run away from
the rest of the field. It will be a
close, well-fought tournament.”’

“If we could have called back

games we would have won.”’

The Generals finally ended
their slump in the second game

nonite after losing the opener

observed Murdock.

 

Sports

 

W&L played a near-perfect
game in the nightcap, ripping 19
hits and getting shutout pitch-
ing from Jim Brockelman and
Jim Stanley. Thad Ellis and
Jody Harris crushed homers for
the Generals. ‘‘Even the
substitutes got a couple of runs
against them,’’ said Murdock.
The squad also played well in
their 5-3 win in the first game of
the double header against
Maryville. Rich Hachenberg
pitched well in picking up the
win.

In the second game of the
doubleheader, the Generals
held a solid 3-1 lead, but then
made some costly mistakes to
allow the Scots to tie the contest
at 3-3. At that point, a heavy
downpour forced suspension of
the game until the next day

However, the wait was worth-
while for W&L. After a Chris
Cavalline double, a Jeff Hag-
gerty single and a walk to Kevin
Golden, Dave Warrenfeltz rip-
ped a two-run single to give the
Generals an exciting 5-4 win.

In Tuesday’s 3-2 heartbreak-
ing loss to Lynchburg, the
Generals took a 2-0 lead but
could not hold off a late inning
rally by the Hornets, the peren-
nial ODAC champion and cur-
rently ranked third in Division
Ill.

Jody Harris started a two-run
first inning for W&L with a
sharp single to center. After a
Thad Ellis walk, Mike Walsh
forced him at second, but
Lynchburg threw the ball away
trying to get Walsh, allowing
Harris to score. Jeff Haggerty
knocked in the other W&L run
with a groundout.

Lynchburg tied the score with
single runs in the fifth and sixth
innings off reliever Dave Ran-
dall. He had replaced starter
Billy White, who left the game

Generally Speaking :

But What About
The Other Game?

by G. Bruce Potter

Just in case you forgot, the Washington and Lee lacrosse team
did play two games last week.

Oh, sure, everyone knows they lost to the University of Virginia
22-8 in Charlottesville on Sunday, But they also eased by the College
of William and Mary in the historical town of Williamsburg last
Tuesday by a count of 15-10.

After jumping out to a quick 3-0 lead early in the first period, it
looked as though the Generals also forgot about a battered William
and Mary squad and began looking ahead to Sunday’s match-up
with the Cavaliers.

The Indians came back to tie the score at three and then played
W&L even until the Generals scored four consecutive goals to turn
a slim 8-7 lead into a safe 12-7 advantage midway through the fourth
stanza.

Yet, there was very little doubt as to which team was the best on
this overcast, windy afternoon. The Generals virtually dominated
the game at both ends of the field but made some very crucial ex-
ecution mistakes that kept the contest close. Their domination is
emphasized by the fact that they won 21 of 28 faceoffs and picked up
60 of 93 groundballs. : :

Poor passing by the Generals and some outstanding goaltending
by Indian goalie Randy Duke also helped keep the game a game, if
that’s what you want to call it. For example, early in the fourth
quarter, Barry Waterman broke clear down the middle and fired a
point-blank shot at Duke, only to have the Indian goalie make an in-
credible save.

However, the ball remained inthe Generals’ possession and
Waterman found himself virtually alone in the middle again, but
dropped a centering pass, and the Indians recovered the ground
ball.

Washington and Lee goalie Ware Palmer twice tried to be a hero
himself by keeping the ball and racing down the field. The first
time, he was preparing to take a shot from about ten yards when
the ball was stolen from him from behind. The second time, late in:
the game, he didn’t even make it to midfield before having the ball
knocked out of his stick and the Indians score a goal before he could
get back to the net.

Surprisingly, Washington and Lee also dominated in an area they
don’t usually dominate — the fans. Even though the game was in
Williamsburg, there were at least as many W&L fans as William
and Mary fans. Then again, how can you blame the William and
Mary fans when their team has a 2-9 record?

But some of the Indian fans, aided by a couple of six-packs,
became rather boisterous. Midway through the third quarter, with
the Generals holding an 8-4 lead, one commented, “I wish W&L
would hurry up and score. I predicted they would get 15 goals — in
the first half.”

Later, another fan gave Washington and Lee the name “W and H-
ll : ”

After several consecutive Washington and Lee mistakes in the
fourth quarter, the same fan yelled, “You guys-don’t stand a
chance against Virginia on Sunday!”’

To which, a W&L fan retorted, “At least we play Virginia.”

Defending champion and top-
ranked North Carolina will
come to town this Saturday to
take on the Washington and Lee
lacrosse team at 2 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Coach Willie Scroggs’ ex-
plosive team features several
All-Americans, including mid-
fielders Doug Hall and Kevin
Griswold, attackman Mike
Burnett and junior goalie Tom
Sears.

The Generals anticipate that
a large turnout, perhaps in ex-
cess of 5,000, will be on hand to
support W&L as it challenges
the number one team in the na-
tion. Two years ago, the
Tarheels attracted 6,000 fans to
Wilson Field for a 7-5 victory
over the Generals.

W&L head coach Jack Em-
mer acknowledges that it will
take a strong combination of
vocal support from the student
body as well as a supreme effort
by his team to keep pace with
UNC. “It’s not often you get to
play the top team on your own

field. Hopefully, we’ll get a good
crowd. We’re looking forward
to giving it our best shot,”’ said
Emmer.

Over the break, the Generals
had matches at William and
Mary Tuesday and Virginia
Sunday.

W&L was a heavy favorite
against the William and Mary
Indians and put 51 shots on goal
but nevertheless was held in
check before the Generals
notched the last two goals for a
15-10 win.

At Charlottesville, the third-
ranked Cavaliers were in the
favorite’s role. The final
margin (22-8, UVA) was not ex-
pected, however, especially in
light of the intense rivalry bet-
ween the two schools.

With Ray Guisto accounting
for two of the first three goals,
the Cavaliers led 4-0 after 12
minutes. The score was 10-1 six
minutes into the second
quarter, and things never got
much better for W&L, whose
record fell to 6-2.

At halftime, Virginia held a

 

12-2 bulge and U.Va. coach Jim
(Ace) Adams gave goalie J.B.
Meyer (seven saves) the rest of
the afternoon off.

In all, 15 different players
scored for the. Cavaliers. The
Guistos, Ray and Rick, each ac-
counted for three goals. Matt
Rainis, Mike Carvana, and
freshman Jeff Nicklas had two
apiece as U.Va. built its record
to 5-2.

The Cavaliers excelled in
every department, including
Shots (54-33), ground balls
(63-46), only losing in faceoffs
(18-16, W&L). The Cavs forced
the Generals into numerous
ballhandling mistakes, taking
W&L out of its offense and leav-
ing the Lexington contingent at
Scott Stadium stunned.

There wasn’t much for
General fans to cheer about
once Ray Guisto opened to scor-
ing at 4:08 with a hard, rising
25-footer. Virginia had excep-
tional success beating W&L
goalie Ware Palmer from long
range.

Emmer recalled Palmer in
favor of sophomore Phil Aiken
four minutes into the second
quarter when the count had
already reached 9-1. Palmer
came back to start the second
half then left for good with six
minutes to go in the game. He
allowed 14 goals and was
credited with nine saves.

At the other end of the field, it
took a couple of excellent in-
dividual efforts to get the ball
by Meyer.. Rich Schoenberg
converted a loose ball in front of
the net into W&L’s first goal.
John Sancilio dodged his
defender in the midfield for the
second.

Sancilio and John Doub
scored a pair of goals each for
the Generals, but the Cavaliers’
tough close defense held the
W&L attack to unassisted goals
by Lee Heimert and Mike
Schuler. The team’s leading
scorer coming into the game,
Rob Staugaitis, was limited to
one assist.

Private Art Collection
On Display In Dupont

An exhibition of paintings,
prints, and drawings from the
private collection of Ralph
Grant opened yesterday in the
duPont Gallery on _ the
Washington and Lee University
campus.

The exhibition continues
through May 9. DuPont Gallery
is open to the public without
charge weekdays from 9 a.m. to
5 p.m., Saturdays from 11 a.m.
to 3 p.m., and Sundays from 2
p.m. to4p.m.

Grant is a designer for the
carpet division of Burlington In-
dustries. He lives in Lexington.

Grant’s collection includes
works by internationally known
artists as well as a series of
works by Philadelphia artists
and another group of works by

artists from the Lexin area.
“The show at duP will in-
clude several differen. groups:
photographs, op-art, land-
scapes, and some figurative
works,’’ Grant explained.

‘‘A show such as this is an ex-
cellent opportunity in that it
opens a private collection up for
public viewing and makes it
possible to share the works with
a much wider audience,”’ Grant
added.

This is the second exhibition
in a series of annual shows
based on the works from local
and area art collectors. Last
year works from the collection
of Washington and Lee
chemistry professor Keith Shill-
ington were featured in the first
such exhibition.

Public Speaking Professor

Awarded Summer Grant

Dr. Halford R. Ryan,
associate professor of public
speaking at Washington and
Lee University, has been
awarded a research grant from
the Maurice L. Mednick
Memorial Fund for study this
summer.

The Mednick Memorial Fund
is administered by the Virginia
Foundation for Independent
Colleges (VFIC), a fund-raising
consortium of 12 four-year
private colleges in the state, in-
cluding Washington and Lee.

Ryan will use his Mednick
research grant to pursue
studies at the Lyndon Baines
Johnson Presidential Library in
Austin, Texas.

He plans to conduct research

into President Johnson’s voting
rights speech, which Johnson
delivered to a joint session of
Congress in 1965.

In addition to examining
various drafts of the speech and
the contributions of Johnson’s

. speechwriters to the final pro-

duct, Ryan will view videotapes
to assess Johnson’s delivery
and will investigate reaction to
the speech as indicated by mail
received at the White House.

“Conducting research at the
LBJ Presidential Library is a
superb opportunity since it pro-
vides access to information not
available anywhere else,’’ said
Ryan.

Ryan joined the faculty at
Washington and Lee in 1970. A
graduate of Wabash College

Alum Donates $25,000

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a gift of
$25,000 from William M. France
of Lancaster, Ohio, to establish
an endowed scholarship fund in
honor of W&L history professor
Charles W. Turner.

France, a 1958 graduate of
Washington and Lee, is presi-
dent of WHOK, Inc., which

operates WLOH/WHOK, the
radio stations in Lancaster. He
is a past vice president of Socie-
ty National Bank in Cleveland.
Turner joined the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1946. A native
of Fredericks Hall in Louisa
County, Va., Turner received
his B.A. degree from the
University of Richmond

with a master’s degree and a
Ph.D. from the University of Il-
linois, he has recently published
two articles dealing with
presidential addresses. In one,
he examined the fourth in-
augural speech of Franklin D.
Roosevelt; in the other, he ad-
dressed Harry S Truman’s 1951
speech in which Truman spoke
of the dismissal of Gen. Douglas
MacArthur.

The Mednick Memorial Fund
was created in 1976 after the ac-
cidental death of a young Nor-
folk industrialist. His family
and business associates
established the fund to
perpetuate his name and to
recognize his own strong in-
terest in higher education.

The VFIC administers the
fund to encourage professional
development of college
teachers and improve their
competence through grants for
research and advanced study
and to assist highly qualified,
needy students in their upper-
class years in college.

Dr. Roger B. Jeans Jr.,
associate professor of history at
Washington and Lee, used a
grant from the Mednick Fund
for research in China last year.
