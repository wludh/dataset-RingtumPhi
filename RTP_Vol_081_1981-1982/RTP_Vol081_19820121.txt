M.D. Superdance Chairman
Sets Event’s Goal At $22,000

by Tom Baker -

The Washington and Lee
Muscular Dystrophy Dance
Marathon, to be held Jan. 29-30
in Evans Dining Hall, is shaping |
up as an event encompassing
both the W&L and Rockbridge
County communities.

Tripp Brower, Superdance ’82
Chairman, stressed that he is
“trying to provide ‘‘anyone who
wants to get involved a chance
to get involved.”’ Brower added
that “to participate is quite a
committment but something
anyone would benefit from.”

Brower expects as,many as
200 people to dance and has set
the dance’s goal at an earning

‘of $22,000. The entire event, |

described by Brower as

“W&L’s longest party,”’ will in-
clude six live bands, three tape
shows and numerous special
events for both the dancers and
the spectators.

Adding 2 Members
Considered By EC

by Ben Jarratt

A proposal to add two new
members to the Executive
Committee was introduced at
Monday night’s meeting.

“The additional members
would allow for equal represen-
tation,” stated Morgan Griffith,
Senior Law Rep. “It would also
insure the fairness of the honor
system and the possibility of
pre-trial prejudice by members
of the E.C.””

Griffith added that the
changes were ‘‘a recommenda-
tion from last year’s E.C, to this
year’s body.”’

Amendments would be need-
ed for both the Student Body
Constitution and the White
Book. The governing function of
the E.C. will not change, while
the honor system functions will
change slightly.

Presently, the E.C. consists of
12 members. During honor
trials, two members of the E.C.
and a third chosen from the stu-
dent body form an investigating
committee that looks into possi-
ble violations. The two E.C.
members may also serve on the
honor hearings of cases they
have investigated.

“The major effect is to have
the investigative members not

- serve on the hearings,”’ Griffith

stated. ‘‘There may be some
prejudice by E.C. members
who sit in on both investigations
and then hearings.’’

Griffith proposed that addi-
tional representatives be

. chosen from the freshmen class

and the second year law class.

‘This would allow more equal

representation of the student

body.

E.C. President Eric Myers
thought the committee should

devote some time to this issue.

Elections and amendments
would not be held until the Spr-
ing term.

Ben Hale, ’84 Rep., motioned
that the proposals be tabled un-

til next ta: S meeting. This
would give members a chance
to consider the matter. The mo-
tion passed, 11-0, with Tripp
Brower having left the meeting
earlier.

Hale suggested the possibility
of splitting the E.C. into two
bodies — an honor board and an
administrative board. Frank’
Smith ’83 Rep., said he would
like to study this idea with Hale.

The E.C. spent almost an
hour debating its involvement
in having a deferred fraternity
rush at W&L. The issue has
already been raised by the In-
terfraternity Council. Smith

wanted to know about possible
E.C. involvement in this area.

 

Morgan Griffith

John Vlahoplus, ’83 Rep.,
stated that deferred rush is an
area that E.C. ought to address.
“It is an issue that affects the
student body,” said Vlahoplus,
Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., said defer-
red rush was a fraternity mat-
ter. ‘‘Let the IFC work on it,”
stated Lang. “The E.C. cannot
tell the IFC how to conduct
rush.”’

“You are missing the point,”
said President Eric Myers.
‘‘What we want to do is discuss
the issue.’”” Hale commented
that ‘‘although rush affects in-
dependents, it is a fraternity
matter. But any issue that af-
fects the student body can be
discussed by this body.”’

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Disappointed About Miller;

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Happy Birthday,
Mr. Latture

Congratulations are in order to Mr. Rupert Latture,
who this week is celebrating both his 90th birthday
and his 70th year at Washington and Lee. Medical
statistics show that the average man lives somewhere
around 70 years. It goes without saying, we believe,
that Mr. Latture has given more than a lifetime of
devotion to this university. |

Mr. Latture serves as a reminder of tbe importance
of incorporating the past into the present. He is one of
the founders of Omicron Delta Kappa, a society that
has blossomed into a national organization. His desire
to create an organization promoting relations be-
tween students and the community has developed into
a nation-wide affair.

Congratulations again, Mr. Latture.

The EC And Rush

The Executive Committee discussed Rush at its last
meeting. Despite the fear of some members that the
Interfraternity Council might feel its turf had been
violated, the result was perhaps the E.C.’s most in-
teresting meeting of the year. |

Frank Smith, ’83 Rep., introduced a motion to talk
about the touchy subject of delaying Rush until either
the second month or second semester of the school
year. Smith has hardly been vocal or outspoken in his
E.C. career, but in broaching the topic he has done
what his fellow members would not do for more than a
semester.

The reason for delaying this discussion may have
been courtesy for the I.F.C., or it might have been
laziness. When the topic was discussed, however, it
became evident that most of the E.C. had been think-
ing about it and talking about it among themselves.
Perhaps this is why the E.C. finally said something
about delayed Rush. It is a question on the minds of
people both in and out of fraternities, and therefore
should be brought up in the most important forum
available on campus.

Some E.C. members doubted whether they had the
jurisdiction to be talking about Rush. If the E.C. is
looking for precedent, it need only look at the actions
of last year’s president, Bob Willis. It was Willis who,
upon hearing a rumor that a fraternity had slipped a
drug into a girl’s drink, took it upon himself to appear
before the I.F.C. Clearly, Bob Willis believed that
E.C. members could and should take note of fraterni-
ty matters.

Part of the charm of having an elected student
government is seeing those elected officials concern
themselves with all aspects of campus life. No less an
authority than the university catalogue states that the
E.C.’s role, besides maintaining the honor system, is
“monitoring all student-related campus activities.”

We praise the Frank Smith for having the insight to
raise the Rush question before the E.C. We only hope
that some of his constituents share his enthusiasm for
discussion. We are not asking the Executive Commit-
tee to come up with any answers, we only hope that it
remains open to such discussions.

Too many people on campus share the belief that
the E.C. exists only to “‘grill’’ people for honor viola-
tions. Intelligent discussions, such as Monday’s
debate about Rush, shows that the Executive Com-
mittee is fulfilling its role in the student government.

Curious About Delayed Rush

Dear Sir:

I was quite disappointed to
learn that the Arthur Miller is
not coming to Lexington, but
rather an Arthur Miller is to ap-
pear. Reviewing the Contact
schedule with this in mind,
leads me to question whether
quantity or quality provides the
best policy for the selection of
speakers at W&L. The present
year’s high point seems to be F.
Lee Bailey, last year’s was G.
Gordon Liddy. Granted, Bailey
is a step up from Liddy, but he
certainly is not of the caliber of
Arthur Miller or, for that mat-
ter, Tom Stoppard.

I do realize the high cost of
speakers. Yet I think one has to
consider the distinct possibility
that blowing all the money on
two major speakers of some
fame and interest, rather than
giving ‘the university a
smorgasbord of obscure foot-
notes, would reach more people
in the university community. I
am not calling for a speaker’s
list drawn from a popularity
poll, I am asking for speakers
with names that don’t have to
be explained.

I have some trouble with the
misunderstanding about Arthur
Miller. Could it be that the

members of Contact expected
people to automatically assume
the name to refer to a Harvard
Law professor? If this is the
case, perhaps we should have
some second thoughts as re-
gards their ability to discern
and select speakers for W&L.
Delayed Rush

While I’ve got the soapbox
out, I might as well put in my
two cents about delayed rush.
There are, as I see it, basically
two arguments against the pro-
posal. First, a delayed rush
would allow freshmen to
discover that fraternity life is
not like rush year-round, but is
in some ways better and in
others worse. I would not sug-
gest a system of no contact
before the delayed rush though.
The more contact the better.
It’s hard enough for frats to
keep up the hype-job during the
present rush period, it would be
next to impossible to do so into
February. The consolation is
that fraternities would be gain-
ing pledges who know more ex-
actly what they are getting into
(thus making better members,
one might assume) and pledges
whom the frats knew more
about. ;

The second argument against

a delayed rush is that the early
rush allows freshmen to get to
know more people quickly.
There are a number of points to
be raised against this. The pro-
bability of getting to know
anyone better at a typical frat
party must be next to nonexis-
tent. At schools without frats or
with delayed rushes, it cannot
be denied that, however inex-
plicable it may seem, students
do get to know one another. And
wouldn’t it be better to have
freshmen approach frats from a
position of already having
friends? Wouldn’t he find the
warm welcome at frat, during
rush, less seductive? Assuming
that frat life is a very positive
experience, and I have no

doubts that, for the most part, it

is (why else would so many
students remain in frats?), then
why would frats protest against
a system which would give the
freshmen a better opportunity
to see the subtler benefits of frat
life? To conclude, there is a
bonus which no one seems to
have noticed, that is an extend-
ed and thus less hectic party
schedule. If rush was not so
rushed, then maybe so many

people, both freshmen and frat

Students Find Cartoon Racist

Dear Sir

We are writing in protest of a
cartoon which was published in
Issue No. 13 of The Ring-tum
Phi. This cartoon depicted a
group of black entertainers be-
ing directed to the servants’ en-
trance of what appeared to be
Evans Dining Hall. The caption
read, WHADDYA MEAN
“SERVANTS’ ENTRANCE”?
WE THE BAND, MON... We
hope its intent was innocent, but
to us it implied an affirmation
of the old racist stereotype
which casts all Blacks in the
role of servants.

It may interest you to know
that there are students at W&L
who are black, and while we are
aware that our presence here is
neither recognized nor ap-
preciated by some of the
students and faculty here, we
think it behooves a supposedly
responsible campus organiza-
tion such as The Ring-tum Phi
to refrain from pandering to the
archaic misconceptions of these
bigots.

We found the cartoon and the
accompanying caption ex-
tremely offensive. Moreover,
we felt that it expressed a
thorough disregard for our sen-
sibilities.

The cartoon is not only in-
sulting, but also irresponsible.
In our view it has _ been
detrimental to the spirit of
detente and fellowship that we

' strive to perfect between the

races, A proper respect for each

 

other’s integrity in necessarily
of the utmost importance and
concern.

We, the undersigned, there-
fore respectfully submit that it

W&L Completes 10-Year, $67 Million Program

. Washington and Lee Univer-
sity announced that it has suc-
cessfully completed its 10-year
development program by rais-
ing $67-million, thereby sur-
passing the $62-million goal set
for last December 31.

The Washington and Lee pro-
gram is the largest successful
effort by a college or university
of its size. Washington and
Lee’s current enrollment is
1,650 and the university has
16,000 living alumni.

Robert E.R. Huntley,
Washington and Lee’s presi-
dent, made the announcement
at Tuesday’s Founders’ Day
ceremonies. ‘“‘The astounding
success of the program is a
mark of the vitality of this old
school and an unmistakable
sign of the loyalty and generosi-
ty of those who love her,”
Huntley said. ‘‘The largest fac-
tor in our achievement has been
the extraordinary role of our
board of trustees, which
throughout the years has never
flagged in its generous example
and its committed leadership.

‘“‘We who serve here on the
campus can properly regard
the achievement as a mandate
for continued pursuit of the
ideals of liberal education at
Washington and Lee. We cannot
regard our university as secure,
‘but we can regard it as strong
enough to approach the future
boldly and unafraid.”

The $67-million in gifts
represents $22.8 million in en-
dowment resources, $30.8
million for construction of new

facilities and renovation of ex-
isting facilities, and $13.4
million committed over the 10
years through the university’s
annual giving programs and by
other unrestricted gifts.

In addition to the $67-million
raised during the development
program, the university receiv-
ed an unrestricted bequest of
approximately $12-million from
the estate of the late John Lee
Pratt of Fredricksburg, Va., in
January 1976. In accordance
with the provisions of that be-
quest, the Pratt gift is being us-
ed by the university to improve
salaries and student scholar-
ship programs. It has played,
and will continue to play, a vital
role in allowing the university
to confront the eroding effects
of inflation.

Washington and Lee’s 10-year
fund-raising program was
chaired by the rectors, or
chairmen, of the university’s
board of trustees between 1972
and the present: John Newton
Thomas of Richmond, Va.
(1970-74), the late Ross L.
Malone (1974),
Nuckols Jr. of Weston, Vermont
(1974-1981), and James M.
Ballengee of Philadelphia, Pa.
(1981-present).

Joining the rectors — with
responsibility for planning and
executing the overall program
were the chairmen of the board
of trustees’ development com-
mittee: John M. Stemmons of
Dallas, Tex. (1972-1977), John
L. Crist Jr. of Charlotte, N.C.
(1977), and S.L. Kopald of Mem-

E. Marshall .

phis, Tenn. (1978-present). In
addition, the university relied
heavily on the leadership of two
volunteer organizations, the 60-
member Achievement Council
and the 64-member Develop-
ment Council, during the pro-
gram.

Through the development
program, the university has
more than doubled the size of its
1972 endowment in_ strict
monetary figures. In 1972 when
the program was announced,
the endowment stood at roughly
$22-million; commitments for
new endowment total $22.8-
million.

General endowment income
is used primarily for faculty
Salaries and student services.
The student-aid endowment
provides virtually all the finan-
cial assistance for approx-
imately 26 percent of the W&L
student body.

As a result of endowment
gifts added through the develop-
ment program, the university
has been able to create 72 en-
dowed scholarships, six endow-
ed professorships, three endow-
ed teaching funds, and
numerous memorial endow-
ments in support of particular
academic activities.

When the university’s board
of trustees announced the pro-
gram in 1972, it made the an-
nual giving programs an in-
tegral part of the overall effort.
Washington and Lee depends on
annual giving for approximate-
ly 11 percent of its educational
and general operating budget.

A projection of $8.2-million
was set for annual giving be-

tween 1971-72 and the end of :

1981. The annual giving pro-
gram ‘and other forms of
unrestricted current gifts ex-
ceeded that goal by $5.2-million,
enabling Washington and Lee to
balance its budget each year
over the period during which in-
flation. and an erratic stock
market presented unusually dif-
ficult financial realities.

When the development pro-
gram was announced in 1972, a
new $3.2-million addition to the
university’s Doremus Gym-
nasium had just been com-
pleted and represented the first
fund-raising objective included
in the comprehensive program.

Since 1972, the following pro-
jects (in addition to the gym-
nasium) have been physically
completed and entirely funded
from gifts made as part of the
development program: Lewis
Hall, the $8-million law school
building; the  $9.2-million
University Library; a $3.2-
million project to remodel the
former library building to
become the home of the School
of Commerce, Economics, and
Politics; the $1.5-million
renovation of Tucker and
Newcomb Halls on the universi-
ty’s historic Colonnade;
restoration of the Lee-Jackson
House; and, extensive develop-
ment of the campus grounds.

During the course of the
development program, three
other major projects have been
undertaken but not financed by

gifts made to the development
program: new apartment-like
dormitories for students, the
Woods Creek Apartments; in-
terior reconstruction of
Graham-Lees freshman dor-
mitory; and, a modernized
kitchen for Evans Dining Hall.

Two other facilities which
were not among the formal ob-
jectives of the development pro-
gram and therefore not includ-
ed monetarily in the results of
the effort are the Skylark Farm
Conference Center on the Blue
Ridge Parkway, a gift from Mr.
and Mrs. Leslie Cheek Jr. of
Richmond, Va., and 30 Univer-
sity Place, a center for the
decorative arts which is the
result of an anonymous gift.

The largest single capital gift
to the development program
was from Frances and Sydney
Lewis of Richmond, Va., who
contributed $9-million for the
law school building and later
gave the university an addi-
tional $1.5-million for other
capital purposes.

An analysis of the constituen-
cy sources of gifts shows that
$44.9-million (67 percent) came
from alumni; $12.4-million (18.5
percent) from friends of the
university ; $5.7-million (8.5 per-
cent) from foundations; $3.8-
million (5.7 percent) from cor-
porations; and, $0.2-million (0.3

percent) from Washington and

Lee’s faculty and staff.

Washington and Lee con-
ducted two separate phases of
its overall program.

19 Students Are ‘Tapped In’ At ODK Ceremonies

Nineteen undergraduates and
law students at Washington and
Lee were “tapped,” or in-
itiated, Tuesday into member-
ship in Omicron Delta Kappa,

members, would not get sick
and tired of it by its end.

Joining a frat is a major step
for the individual freshman,
even more so for the frat. The
system must be shaped to his
advantage or else we must face
the question of whether the
fraternity system exists for the
students or the freshmen exist
for the fraternity system. In the
words of Gene Brodie, one-time
Rush Chairman, “Give me a
freshman at an impressionable
age, and he is ours for life.”’ It is
my sincere hope that this ques:
tion is thoroughly discussed.

Many thanks for your con-

W&L Swimmers Among
Best In The Country

The Washington and Lee
swim team has stormed into the
Division III national ‘‘best
time’’ rankings compiled by the
College Swimming Coaches
Association as several Generals
appear on the most recent
listing, which is dated January
12.

W&L swimmers stand atop
four categories: senior Mike
Bernot (Hampton, Va.) in the
50-yard freestyle at 21.21
seconds and in the 100-yard
freestyle with 46.41 seconds;
sophomore Tim Rock (Houston,
Tex.) in the 1000-yard freestyle
with a clocking of 9:59.34; and
in the 400-yard freestyle relay
where W&L stands at 3:14.18.

In addition, Bernot also
stands third in the 200-yard
freestyle category and Rock
fourth in the 500-yard freestyle
division.

Sophomores Rand McClain
(Miami, Fla.) and Jeff Gee
(Johnson City, Tenn.) also ap-

dual meet portion of their
schedule. W&L currently stands
1-2 on the season following
losses this past Friday, Jan. 15
to James Madison (64-40) and
Saturday, Jan. 16 to Towson
state (74-28) in action at the Cy
Twombly Pool. The Generals
will resume action this Friday
evening at the University of
Richmond and Saturday after-
noon against Appalachain State
at the V.M.I pool.

“Our dual meet plan is to find
depth in each event and give our
swimmers the chance to
develop versatility outside of
their specialty,’’ offers
Remillard. “It’s not a good idea
to force your athletes to swim
their specialty each time,
especially in back-to-back
meets, so we let them try their
wings in new areas.”’

Remillard points to Bernot,
McClain, and junior Rob
Crawford (Ft. Walton Beach,
FL.) as examples. “Bernot is
our top freestyle sprinter but
swam in the 200-yard individual
medley against Madison, turn-
ing in our season’s best time.
McClain, another sprinter, and
Crawford, our breaststroker,
have been-working in the 500-
yard freestyle event,” relates
Remillard.

Last week’s snow storm kept
the Washington and Lee wrestl-
ing team from competing in the
Georgia Tech Invitational. As a
result, the Generals are looking
forward to this Saturday’s
fourth annual W&L _Invita-
tional.

The preliminaries for the all-
day event will get underway at
11 a.m. on Saturday, with the
championships scheduled to
begin somewhere around 8 p.m.

“This invitational is one of the
more competitive events on our
schedule,” said Head Coach
Gary Franke, pointing out that
all of the teams are college-
division members. The entrants
include from North Carolina,
Catawba, Pfeiffer, Elon and

by Rick Swagler

Some people have said that
John Butler is a quiet type of
person. This, however, is only a
case of actions speaking louder.
than words. The senior
psychology major at W&L is
quite a good kayaker. So good,
in fact, that last year in the
world championships held in
Wales he led the United States
team to a second place finish
behind the French. In the in-
dividual standings, he finished
third. ‘

Butler switched from open
canoeing to kayaking in 1975
when his father bought a kayak.
Each year from mid-April to
mid-July, Butler trains at the
Nantahala Outdoor Center in
North Carolina. The area has

 

what is to considered to be some
of the best whitewater in the
country and is a mecca for
many American kayakers.
While at school, Butler trains on
the Maury River, although this
is just flat water training.
Butler also lifts weights, runs,
and enjoys racquetball.

There are two types of kayak-
ing: white water in which
Butler concentrates, and flat
water. Both are scored strictly
on time. In white water, there is
no set course and the race lasts
twenty to thirty minutes. Flat
water is different in that it is
usually held on a lake and is
either a 500 or 1000 meter race.

When asks what it takes to be
a good kayaker, Butler replied:
“Part of it is a natural, and then
I think like any other sport that
you're competing in, a lot of it is
just hard work. You have to put
in time.”

 

White Water Champion

With the Olympics only two
years away, Butler has begun to
make plans. One small stumbl-
ing block, though, is the fact that
flat water kayaking is the only
event held. ‘‘I’ll probably try
for the 1984 Olympic team, but
since I haven’t raced flat water,
I don’t have any idea how I'll
do,”’ Butler commented.

Bulter plans on attending the
1983 World ‘Championships
(they are only held every other
year) in Italy and even has a
map on his wall with the site
circled.

Although Butler did well at
the 1981 World Championships,
he did have some problems. At
10:30 on the morning of the
race, the course was closed to
practice. Although the team
manager knew about it, he
neglected to post the informa-
tion. Butler and some others
went out for some practice not
knowing it was closed. As
Butler recalls, ‘‘I was the only
one who was caught on the
course, so they disqualified me.
[had to file an official reinstate-
ment and all that stuff. I actual-
ly raced wihtout knowing
whether I was qualified. It was
a nice high, though, because as
soon as I crossed the finish line,
I heard that I had. been re-
instated and then ten or fifteen
seconds later I heard that I had
moved into third position.”

The amount of time Butler
has put into his kayaking has
been costly — especially his
taking off each spring to train.
When asked if this was just a
sacrifice he decided to make,
Butler replied, “I don’t really
consider it a sacrifice.”

wood, Lynchburg and W&L. All
eight schools competed in last
year’s tourney in which
Catawba edged Elon by three

eleventh in that tourney.

“‘We should improve our team
finish this time around simply

_ because we are an improved

team, especially in the upper
classes,” said Franke. “Last
year, only three of our wrestlers
stood a good chance in the in-
vitational. This time, we’ve got
at least five who should perform

Homebody Generals Reach 8-4, Roanoke Tonight

by G. Bruce Potter

The team that performed
very well at home (7-1) and
equally poorly on the road.(1-7)
in the NFL last season was call-
ed the Detroit Lions. In col-
legiate basketball, you might
label them the Washington and
Lee Generals.

A 55-53 loss to Bridgewater on
the road sandwiched between
home victories over Emory and
Henry 63-50 and Johnson State
89-41 raised the Generals record
to 8-4, but they are winless away
from the friendly confines of the
Warner Center.

“I’m not sure what our pro-
blem is on the road,’’ said head
coach Verne Canfield. ‘‘But I
know there are a lot of factors
involved. It means something
for other teams to beat us.”’

Brian Hanson, who led all
scorers with 20 points, and John
Lee Graves combined for ten
points over a seven-minute
stretch of the second half
against Emory and Henry as
the Generals ran off 12
unanswered points to rebound
from a four-point deficit and
take a 54-46 lead with 3:53 left in
the half.

The Wasps had taken a seven
point lead at 40-33 early in the
final half, but four points by Jay
Fechtel and a basket by George
Spears pulled the Generals
back intothe contest.

Poor shooting had kept them
behind throughout much of the
game as W&L only shot 37.7%
from the floor compared to the

Wasps’ 47.8%. “We didn’t take
shots within the structures and

limitations of our offense,’’ ex-.

plained Canfield.

The Bridgewater game on
Saturday night was almost an
exact copy of the Emory and
Henry game except the teams
were reversed. This time it was
W&L who took the big early

lead, 16-4 midway through the
first half and 40-31 with 16:55
left in the game, but
Bridgewater battled back by
holding the Generals scoreless
for over eight minutes to create
a see-saw struggle that went
down to the buzzer.

Frank Eppes’ basket gave the
Generals their last lead at 51-50
with 2:21 remaining, but the
Eagles hit on five of six foul
shots over that time span, and
Spears’ potential game-winning
shot was off the mark with ten
seconds left.

“We were defensed during
the second half,” said Canfield.
“We just stood around and lost
the ball, and the turnovers turn-
ed the momentum and got the
crowd into the game.”

The Generals, now 2-2 in the
ODAC, committed 18 turnovers
and shot 50% from the floor, but
only 3-5 from the foul line.
Bridgewater, on the other hand,
shot 43.1% and 85% (17-20),
respectively. Hanson and
Spears contributed 12 points
apiece to the Generals’ cause,
and Graves added 10.

The 89-41 victory over
Johnson St. (Vermont) was the
Generals’ biggest since a 93-34
crushing of Massachusetts
Maritime early in the 1974-75
campaign. Graves led a parade
of 13 Generals who figured in
the scoring by hitting on 7 of 11
shots and a free throw for 15
points. Fechtel added a career-
high 12 points, as did Hanson.

Shooting 58.5% from the floor
to Johnson State’s 35.1%, the
Generals only trailed at 2-0, but
quickly scored ten straight
points and just kept increasing
the lead from there. It was 43-16
at the half, and hit the 50-point
mark with 18 seconds remain-
ing on Jackson MacFarlane’s

lay-up at 89-39. As well as
- shooting so poorly from the

floor, the Indians (0-7) only hit
on 3 of 14 foul shots (21.4%).

The Generals now turn their
attention to Roanoke College,
11-1 and ranked 11th in the na-
tion last week, at the Warner
Center at 8:00 tonight. ‘In-
dividual talent-wise, we match

up very poorly with Roanoke. ~

But if we stay within the struc-
tures of our offense and
defense, we’ll have a chance,”’
said Canfield.

He added that two keys to the
game would be Washington and
Lee’s reaction to the Maroons’
pressure defense and how well
they keep Roanoke off the offen-
sive boards.

For comparison’s_ sake,
Roanoke was upset by Emory.

and Henry 64-63 on Saturday

night and beat Johnson State
88-59 on Monday.

Graves leads the Generals
with 15.7 points a game. Close
behind is Hanson, who is
averaging 12.3 and leads the
team in rebounds with 6.8 a

game.

Review:

‘Bandits’ Is Lost In Time

by Todd Jones

Time Bandits is considered to
be the sleeper hit of this season.
It has been billed as a ‘Wizard
of Oz” for the current ‘‘young
generation.” While the film ap-
peals to young people, it is only
a ‘Wizard of Oz’ in the sense
that there are midgets in both
movies.

The film deals with a little
boy who is captured (willingly)
by five midgets. These midgets
have a map of the universe.
They explain to the boy that
since the world was created in
only a week, there are certain
flaws in its construction, and at
certain times at certain places,
holes appear through which you
can travel to another time.

These five midgets are
travelling through history,
stealing all the valuable things
they can find and then escaping
through the holes. At various
times, they meet up with
Napoleon, Robin Hood, Ogres,
Evil and even take a ride on the
Titanic.

In each of these instances, the
scenes are played to a comic

end and then the midgets move
on. Finally, the midgets are
trapped by Evil, who, with the
map, will control the world.
If this were indeed ‘‘The Wizara
of Oz,” Judy Garland would
have danced and sung her way
out of such a mess. Instead, the
midgets (after eating the heads
of rats) call on the cavalry,
medieval knights and laser
guns to battle the bad guy. The
midgets are not saved, how-
ever, until The Supreme Being
pays a visit and destroys most
of Evil. Unfortunately, the little
bit of Evil that remains appears
in the boy’s parents’ toaster
oven. We leave the theatre with
the knowledge that we must still
combat evil in today’s society,
or hope that Letitia Pate does
not use toaster ovens.

Time Bandits has an ex-
cellent supporting cast in the
likes of John Cleese (of Monty
Python fame) Sean Connery,
David Warner, Michael Palin,
Shelley Duvall and Kathryn
Hellman. While featured only in
short segments, they combine
to provide an excellent back-

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s major art exhibition for
this year is currently being
presented in the duPont art
gallery.

The traditionally local theme
for the big presentation is
Natural Bridge. This enormous
phenomenon of nature has in-
spired many early American
artists. There are almost 50
works of these artists dating
from 1787-1890 included in the
exhibit.

“So Beautiful an Arch’’ con-
tains many works of great
value. One of the most beautiful
paintings in the exhibit, a work
by F.E. Church (1852) on loan
from the University of Virginia
art museum, is insured for
$150,000. The painting of highest
value, entitled ‘‘Peaceable
Kingdom of the Branch”’ by Ed-
ward Hicks (1825-1830) and on
loan from Reynolds House, is
insured for $200,000.

Because the exhibit is of such
great value, students are en-
couraged to volunteer to sit in
the gallery during their free
time. $1.50 will be pledged to the
Superdance for every hour
donated to gallery sitting.

One of the most impressive
works of the exhibit was painted
by David Johnson in 1860, This
work is especially interesting
because it depicts the bridge
from. a long view. The intricate
detail of the foliage combines

 

Major Art Exhibition

well with the exactness of the
bridge and its surroundings.

Another remarkable portrait
is one done by F.E. Church in
1852. His representation of the
bridge from a frontal view is
perhaps the most detailed work
in the exhibit. Church uses ex-
tremely accurate colors to
depict the rock formations,
foliage and sky. His beautiful
cloud formations and light and
dark tints are some of the most
appealing aspects of the work.

The collection of works in the
exhibit’ possesses not only
monetary value, but also great
historical value. Pamela H.
Simpson, producer of the ex-
hibit, said.in a Jan. 8 speech
that the exhibit is best seen as
“a. panorama of changing at-
titudes toward nature and
painting.”

According to Dean Simpson,
there are three separate divi-
sions in the method of portray-
ing the bridge. The first of these

 

ground to the midgets’ antics.
The film was produced and
directed by Terry Gillam.
George Harrison provided the
music and the money to make
the film. The special effects are
quite good. It is obvious that a
good deal of attention was paid
to detail. The castle of evil is
created out of lego blocks.

The main drawback to the
film is that many of the
segments are much too long.
The laughs come much too far
between. The film does have a
great deal of creativity,
however, and enough humor to
be entertaining. While Time
Bandits is no ‘‘Wizard of Oz,” it
is worth seeing.

Soprano
Performs

Soprano Ann Berlin will ap-
pear in concert at 8 p.m., Mon.,
Jan. 25, in Lee Chapel. The con-
cert is the third presentation of
the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Concert Guild’s 1981-82
season. Mrs. Berlin will be ac-
companied by pianist Cheryl
Ryan and guitarist Gene
Carter.

The program will consist of
“Serate Musicali” by Rossini,
“Italianisches Liederbuch”’ by
Wolf, ‘‘Trois Chanson’ by
Chausson and “Letters from
Composers”’ by Argento.

A lecturer in music at Hollins
College, Mrs. Berlin, is soloist
and children’s choir director at
St. John’s Episcopal Church in
Roanoke. She earned her B.A.
degree from Hollins, where she
majored in music.

Mrs. Berlin has performed in
the Southwest Virginia Opera
Society productions of “Die
Fledermaus’’ (as Adele), ‘“‘The
Ballad of Baby Doe” (as Sarah)
and “The Marriage of Figaro”
(as Cherubine). She also ap-
peared in the Hollins produc-
tions of ‘“The Old Maid and the
Thief” (as the Old Maid) and
“The Unicorn’”’ (as the wife).

Tickets are $3 and will be
available at the door. Members
of the Washington and Lee com-
munity are admitted free of
charge.

 

methods is the sublime attitude
of the late 18th and early 19th
centuries. During this period,
the bridge was regarded with
both terror and mystery, while
at the same time posessing a
mysterious force. The paintings
of this period depicted the
bridge with emphasis on its size
in relation to surrounding ob-
jects.

The second division occured
in the.mid 1800’s. At this time,

artists felt their interpretations
of the bridge should reflect
God’s presence through natural
beauty. The majority of these
paintings contain minute
details of grass, trees and rock
formations with less emphasis
on the magnitude of the bridge.
The third division of bridge
portrayals is found in the works
of the late 19th century. Artists

A Few Excerpts From Dr. Coulling’s ODK Address

The following are excerpts from
Tuesday’s Founder’s Day speech
by Dr. Sidney Coulling.

Even the most jaded veteran of
our observance of January 19
must agree that today is a very
great day in the more than two
and a quarter centuries of
Washington and Lee’s history.
How, I asked myself, could I
possibly be adequate to such an
occasion, to say anything even
remotely worthy to follow news
of the successful completion of
an extraordinarily ambitious
campaign? As a child I was
often told of the lonely efforts by
the rector of Washington
Academy to raise funds for his
struggling school, traveling by
horse throughout much of the
state and returning from one
absence to discover that the
academy had lost to fire its only
building of any size. As an
undergraduate I was periodic-
ally reminded that although
James River Canal stock might
not be what it once had been,
some of my tuition was still be-
ing paid by the gift from George
Washington. And as a member
of the faculty I shared the em-
barrassment felt here when the
drive to finance what is now
Parmly Hall fell substantially
short of its objective. What can
I say, then, after an announce-
ment that the University has
raised a sum of money, to use a
figure that may in some man-
ner relate it to our founding
fathers, more than four times
that of the Louisiana Purchase?

I am by profession not a fund-
raiser but a teacher of English
literature, and I learned long
ago that one of my calling can
partly if not entirely conceal his
inadequacies by relying on a
text. And so I have adopted that
stratagem today, choosing as
my text a classic treatise on
liberal education that may help
remind us of the ultimate pur-
pose for which these millions
have been given to Washington
and Lee. It is the series of lec-
tures — or discourses, as they
were called — which John
Henry Newman delivered in
Dublin, Ireland, 130 years ago
this spring and which we now
know as The Idea of a Universi-
ty.

S2OCCOHCEOEES

The past never returns,
Newman once observed, and
my purpose in speaking of him
today is not to hold up his
discourses of a century ago as
absolute models by which to
shape our thinking about liberal
education at the present time.
Although he has been rightly
called ‘‘one of the greatest in-
tellectual forces Oxford has
even known,” it can hardly be
denied that huge chasms now
separate his thought from ours.
For him, truth was one and in-
divisible; for us it is multiple
and infinitely fragmented. For
him, knowledge was a complete
circle of linked parts; for us, if
we must describe it by a
geometric form, it is Rubik’s
cube. For him it was reasonable
to say that the function of a
university is to teach universal
knowledge; for us, to say so is to
voice an absurdity.

Between the demands, on the
one hand, for religious or sec-
tarian instruction, and on the
other for vocational or profes-
sional training, Newman
steered a course that could
please neither side. The aim of
a university, he said, was not
moral or religious or practical,
but intellectual — it is the
cultivation, the enrichment, the
enlargement of the mind for its
own sake.

20008808606 808

And there are still more
significant parallels. Newman
was aware, for example, of the
phenomenon that has become
the bane of higher education
—overspecialization — for at
Oxford he had known narrow-
minded pedants, embalmed
corpses impersonating
scholars, the kind that Carlyle
satirized as Dryasdust, that
George Eliot _ brilliantly
depicted as Casaubon in
Middlemarch, and that the
historian G.M. Young later
characterized as ‘“‘the Waste
Land of Experts, each knowing
so much about so little that he
can neither be contradicted nor
is worth contradicting.’
Newman never condemns spec-
ialization as such, recognizing
its essential place in the modern
world. But he stresses the need

for general culture, for balance
and breadth, for a view of
things beyond the confines of
one’s specialty. His own mind,
according to a remarkable
tribute by one of his ablest
students, ‘‘was world-wide. He
was interested in everything
which was going on in science,
in politics, in literature.
Nothing was too large for him,
nothing too trivial, if it threw
light upon the central question,
what man really was, and what
was his destiny.’’

For Newman, moreover, the
pursuit of knowledge was not
merely arduous; it was also
perilous, He was fully aware of
the truth of which President
Huntley has reminded us in the
past — that education is a
dangerous enterprise. Like his
fellow convert, Gerard Manley
Hopkins, he knew that the
‘“‘mind has mountains; cliffs of
fall/Frightful, sheer, no-man-
fathomed.” At the age of 14,
after reading some French
verse that denied the immor-
tality of the soul, he had ex-
claimed to himself, ‘How
dreadful, but how plausible!”
And in the conclusion to his
Apologia he speaks of the
human intellect as ‘‘wild,”
‘‘Capricious,’’ ‘‘untrust-
worthy.’’ No wonder Huxley
said that he could compile a

primer of infidelity from the
works of Cardinal Newman. But
if there is danger in using the
mind, there is equal danger,
Newman recognized, in not us-
ing it. He was _ thoroughly
familiar with the romantic
malaise of introspection, of
morbid self-consciousness, of
Byronic despair and ennui —
the malaise that has its contem-
porary counterpart in boredom,
in the absence of motivation
and sense of purpose, in the
kind of paralyzing indifference
that has provoked a faculty
member at Ohio University to
Say, as quoted in a recent issue
of the Washington Post, that his
students ‘take down anything
and spit it back to me even
though they don’t believe it. The
reason is they don’t believe
anything.”” The mind can never
be released from such inertia,
Newman believed, unless it is
exercised on the world without.
And though he had surrendered
claim to complete freedom of
thought when he submitted to
the infallible church, deep im-
pulses that he seems never
finally to have subdued led him
to insist that the use of the kind
is both our right and our duty.
Nothing, he says at the begin-
ning of The Idea of a University,
can prevent the human intellect
from speculating; and at the
end, when arguing that the
ultimate purpose of education is

to prepare one for the world, he
declares that “the way to learn
to swim in troubled waters’’ is
to go into them.

He was drawn to nautical im-
agery, as this last phrase might
suggest, and one imagines that
he admired the tribute Words-
worth paid to Newton’s mind,
““forever/Voyaging through
strange seas of thought, alone.’
In any case it is significant, I
think, that the image serves a
crucial purpose in The Idea of a
University no less than in the
Apologia. A stormy sea is
Newman’s metaphor for the in-
tellectually confused as well as
for the spiritually adrift, and a
port his metaphor for the
cultivated mind as well as for
the Roman Catholic Church.
The voyage to intellectual
enlargement is no less long, dif-
ficult, and hazardous than
Newman’s own voyage to
Rome, but both voyages end in
repose, in the satisfying sense,
as Newman puts it in another
context, of knowing and of
knowing that one knows. The in-
tellectual certainty that ter-
minates one voyage is the cer-
titude of faith that terminates
the other, and the ‘calmness,
moderation, and wisdom’’ of
the liberally educated are thus
the secular equivalents of the
peace that passes all
understanding.

Hillsdale Donates $24,000 For Minority Studies

by Todd Smith

A North Carolina charitable
institution has donated $24,000
to finance minority scholar-
ships at Washington and Lee
over the next three years.

This is the second grant since
1972 from the Hillsdale Fund
Inc., which was established by
the family of the late Lunsford

  

John L. White, W&L Director of Minority Affairs.

Richardson Sr., chairman of the
board of Richardson-Vicks Inc.
Sion A. Boney, administrative
vice president of the Hillsdale
Fund, said that its board of
trustees was ‘delighted to be
able to participate in this in-
novative scholarship program
at Washington and Lee.”’
John L. White, director of

   

minority affairs; said that the
grant indicated respect for and
approval of the university’s
minority program. ‘‘At least
they felt we were doing enough
things right,” said White.

White predicted that the
money would be used for com-
petitive scholarships of a value
between $1,000 and $1,200. Ap-
plicants will be judged by class
rank and board scores, he said.

“T think they (at the Hillsdale
Fund) are cognizant that we
just don’t give out the money
because we have it,” said
White. White said that he may
have some freedom with the
three-year deadline. ‘‘If we feel
that only three students qualify
for scholarships one year,
Hillsdale is going to under-
stand.”

The scholarships may help
give Washington and Lee a
recruiting incentive in a time of
cutbacks in student aid from the
federal government. ‘‘The
market in minority students is
going to decrease, and more
universities are gearing up to

recruit them,’’ said White.

“President Reagan is going to
make the college income thing
very difficult,” said the 29-year-
old director. ‘I think it
penalizes an institution like
W&L because we’re looking for
minorities, but only for minori-

 

EC Considers Deferred Rush

(continued from page 1)

Ted McQuiston, ’84 Rep., mo-
tioned that the E.C. encourage
the IFC to look into the possi-
bilities of a deferred rush. The
motion passed, 11-0.

E.C. Secretary Bennett Ross
said he would write a letter to
IFC President Hall Vetterlein,
The letter will state that the
E.C. sees deferred rush as a
serious issue which should be
addressed by the IFC.

In other matters, Dusty
Nelson reported that the Stu-
dent Bar Association has been
inactive for the past month. Ex-
ams before Christmas and
preparations for the February
bar examination have limited
activities. Tripp Brower asked
Nelson about the restructuring
of the Law School Placement
Office. ‘“‘The office is doing a
fine job for students with good
grades and qualifications,”
replied Nelson. ‘‘Not enough
emphasis has been placed on
other students interested in
government.”

Myers questioned an item in
the S.B.A. budget concerning a
transfer of $3,715 to the Law
News account. There was a
mentioning of the money’s
origin. Nelson was not familiar
with the budget and said he
would check with S.B.A.
Treasurer Chris Chapman.
Nelson said he was sure the
money had not been pocketed.
Myers added that the normal
procedure is to keep the money
in the students tax fund until ex-

 

penditures are necessary.

In an ad-hoc report, Frank
Smith said that Fancy Dress is
progressing well. The Student
Activities Board under-

estimated ticket sales and will -

probably cover the $55,000
budget through ticket sales. “If
a deficit occurs,’’ added Smith,
“it would affect the rest of the
year’s social activities.”

Brower and Hale commented
that the Reggae party held last
Friday in Evans Dining Hall ap-
peared to be a success. Security
was not a problem and Jerry
Darrell, Director of Food Ser-
vices, said he was pleased with
the event. Brower added that
the Student Control Committee
had an unusually low number of
discipline cases last term.
“Students seem under control,”’
added Brower.

The S.C.C. did pass one con-
troversial ruling, however.
Students convicted of drunk
driving offenses must appear
before the committee. Brower
added that the S.C.C. will con-
sider each case, but there are
no exact penalties for DWI con-
victions.

John Viahoplus stated that
some S.B.A. members are upset
with athletic teams who monop-
olize the weight room. He said
he would look into the problem.
Ted McQuiston replied that
most teams do have a
legitimate interest in weight-
training.

Two new ad-hoc positions
were filled. Freshman Rep.

Cole Dawson was appointed ad-
hoc member to the Outing Club.
First Year Law Rep. Tom
Booher was appointed to the
Computer Club.

Myers reported that some
students approached him about
allowing computer courses to
be included in Math/Science
distibution credits. Booher, as
newly-appointed member of the

Computer Club, was nominated .

to look into the situation.

Myers noted that a Red Cross

blood drive will be held in
Doremus Gym on Jan. 26.

 

 

Bridge
Exhibit

(continued from page 6)
during this period interpreted
the bridge as _ picturesque,
rather than awesome or
mysterious. Moreover, the
bridge was used as a
background object, rather than
the principle subject.

Dean Simpson believes that
Natural Bridge ‘“‘is too often
dismissed as a tourist attrac-
tion.” She hopes that in viewing
the exhibition, we might ‘‘cap-
ture again the awe that these
earlier artists felt for it.”’

The exhibit will continue to be
presented through Jan. 29 and
will be followed by an exhibit of
20th century photography,
which will be on display Feb.
3-24.

 

 

ty students that can do the
work.”

Another obstacle to recruit-
ment is the growing trend
among blacks to attend pre-
dominately black colleges, ac-
cording to White. In addition,
the very nature of Washington
and Lee, with its small, all male
enrollment, causes obstacles.
W&L cannot recruit black
women, who score higher in
placement tests than black

males.
The basic problem faced by

- recruiters, however, is the

university’s relative obscurity
in minority circles. ‘‘This is a
school that is very  well-
respected in generally upper-
middle-class, white social
circles, It is difficult getting a
reputation among minorities
like Notre Dame or Harvard,”
said White.

The annual process of the
recruitment of minorities at
Washington and Lee begins
when the College Testing Ser-
vice mails the university a list
of 1,400 highly-rated minority
students. A ‘‘mail campaign’
follows, said White, as the
university tries to drum up in-
terest. Minority students are
contacted by black and white
alumni and by blacks currently
enrolled at W&L.

Matthew Towns is an exam-

ple of one such dedicated alum-
nus. A 1974 graduate of W&L
and currently vice president of
the Wacoia Bank of Winston-
Salem, Towns personally writes
all minority applicants.

In the three years that White
has served as minority affairs
director, the university has
received an average of 30 ap-
plications per year. The minori-
ty acceptance rate is 80 percent.
Even in 1978, the worst of recent
years for the Washington and
Lee admissions office, the ac-
ceptance rate of all applicants
has stayed below 75 percent.

In the 15 years since
Washington and Lee first ad-
mitted blacks, 65 percent of its
black students have graduated.
Hillsdale scholars, however,
boast a 90 percent graduation
rate.

White, himself a black
graduate from W&L in 1974,
saw the number of black fresh-
men fall from 15 to seven in his
second year. “I know places
where that kind of fluctuation
can cost you your job,” he said.

The university, however, was
interested in the quality instead
of numbers of minorities ac-
cepted, White said. ‘The
university has made a committ-
ment to having a diverse stu-
dent body and is willing to back
that up with dollars.”

Blood Drive Tuesday

by Bill Woolfolk

The Red Cross will hold a
Blood Drive Tues., Jan. 26, in
Doremus Gymnaisium from 11
a.m. to 5 p.m. The donation
.center is being organized by the
Alpha Epsilon medical fraterni-
ty, the College Republicans and
the Chi Psi social fraternity.

Part of the sponsorship of
these groups includes the dona-
tion of a keg of beer to be
awarded to the fraternity with
the highest percentage of par-
ticipation in the blood drive.

Fraternity members do not ac-

tually have to give blood but
musy be processed through the
line.

Without a reservation, the
length of processing will depend
on the number of participants.
With a reservation, however,
the entire process should take
somewhere between 40 and 50
minutes.

The Red Cross: advises all
donors to avoid strenuous ac-
tivity immediately after giving
blood. No strain should be plac-

Superdance

(continued from page 1)
Two founders of the dance,

Jay Blumberg and J. Hemby,
will return to observe the
festivities. Media coverage of
the event will include broad-
casts by local television and
radio stations.

Brower added that “‘it’s still
not too late to dance,”’ Students
can still register as late as Fri-
day, the day of the dance, the

ed on the arm within 24 to 48
hours of giving blood. Within
that period, the puncture must
seal properly and the body must
replace the lost fluid.

An average human needs be-

-tween one and two weeks to

replace the red blood cells lost
in the donation. White blood
cells, hemoglobin and other
elements are replaced between
four and five weeks.
In comparison with other
Virginia schools, Washington
and Lee ‘has a low percentage of
participation. The following |
represents percentage of ex-

pected donations last year.
Longwood 126%
Roanoke College 121%
Radford 113%
VMI i 111%
Hampden-Sydney 110%

Sweet Briar 96%
Randolph-Macon 94%
Lynchburg College 89%

Washington and Lee 78%

 

only ‘requirement being a
minimum of $55 in pledges.
Brower stressed that he would
like to see as many people in-
volved as possible, including
workers needed to run the
dance.

Anyone interested in par-
ticipating in the Superdance

‘Should contact Carolle Chappel

at the University Center.
