College Inn Report

Thefts During Vacation

by Tom Baker

Thousands of dollars worth of
student property was stolen
over. Thanksgiving vacation,
according to police. Thefts are
usually a problem with every
break.

According to Chief Kirby of
the Lexington Police Depart-
ment, 17 units of the College Inn
apartments at 30 South Main
were broken into sometime be-
tween 7:30 p.m. on Wednesday,
Nov. 25 and 10:00 a.m. on Thurs-
day, Nov. 26. Apparently the
door to each unit burgalarized

had been kicked in. Items that

were taken included stereo
equipment, watches, money,
and clothes. Kirby added that
the value of the amount stolen
from all the students will be in
the thousands of dollars.

The Phi Gamma Delta frater-
nity house at 112 Preston St.
was broken into also over the

Twenty-nine Washington and

break. According to Kirby, the
front door had been left open
and every room in the house
had been entered.

University Proctor Charles
Murray added that the people
who committed these burglar-
ies were probably older and
more experienced than the
youngsters that usually break
into the fraternity houses and
apartments at W&L.

Chief Kirby said that as the
police begin their investigation
into the crimes, they will try to
compile a complete list of
everything that was stolen. In
this way, the police will

recognize any of the stolen-

items if someone were to try to
sell them. Kirby also explained
that this is all a long process
that can take months to com-
plete before anyone is charged
with the crime.

  

by Patrick Jordan

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity is seeking $40,000 in
damages from two Longwood
College students in connection
with their role in the destruction
of several university owned
shrubs two years ago.

The suit filed in the
Rockbridge County Circuit
Court Tuesday alleges that
Lawrence J. Meyer of Farm-
ville and Kevin Newton of
Virginia Beach were among
several Washington and Lee
students who damaged 37
English boxwood shrubs and
one American boxwood plant
between Tucker Hall and
Tucker Annex on Dec. 6, 1979.

Eric Lee Sisler, representing
Washington and Lee in the case,
said several of the plants were
damaged too severely that they
would not survive while others

would require costly care-and
rehabilitation.

Sisler said the university will
have to pay a substantial sum of
money to repair the damaged
Shrubs as well as buy new
shrubs to replace the dead
plants.

The incident occurred after
several Washington and Lee
students and others decided to:
run through the shrubs while
celebrating a one point varsity
basketball victory over
Hampden-Sydney College.

As a result of the incident,
four members of the Washing-
ton and Lee basketball team, in-
cluding the squad’s leading
scorer and captain were
suspended from the team for
one year.

In addition, the Student Con-
trol Committee put all 10
Washington and Lee students

For Damages In Boxwood Case.

involved on social and conduct
probation for one year and the
students had to do eight hours of
volunteer community work per
week.

Sisler said none of the
Washington and Lee students
were mentioned in the suit
because ‘“‘they had already
assumed their financial obliga-
tions concerning the plants.”’

Sisler said both Meyer and
Newton have until Dec. 8 to re-
ply to the suit and that if they do
not answer the motion, the
court will automatically rule
that they pay the university
$40,000.

The English boxwoods were
among 210 plants donated to the
university by Wilmer S.
Poyner, a former New York
Life Insurance Co. agent. His
son, Dr. John Poyner, grad-
uated from W&L in 1962.

for Contact. Co-Chairman Mike

Drinkwater ’83 reported that
Udall would speak Monday,
Dec. 7.

President Eric Myers asked
Drinkwater who Udall was.

‘Udall was Secretary of the
Interior under Kennedy and
Johnson.”

“Oh, of course. How blind of
me,’’ Myers joked.

Secretary Bennett Ross later
asked when letters had been
mailed out to parents asking for
contributions. Ross said that his
parents did not receive a letter
until the week of Thanksgiving.

Co-Chairman Robert McLean
said the letters went out on Nov.
10.

‘So you’re kind of coming in

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Contact’s Lineup

F. Lee Bailey, the nation’s most famous — or in-
‘amous —barrister, will speak Feb. 4, at a cost of
$5900.

Arthur Miller, author of ‘‘Death of a Salesman’’ and
‘The Crucible,’’ will speak here Jan. 26, at a cost of
32750.

A lot of people are complaining that Contact has
failed us so far this year. The first speaker has yet to
be heard. However, the improvement over last year
(when people only thought or
wished that the fall speakers had not started) is a
great improvement indeed.

Compare Miller and Bailey to last year’s top-
hitters, G. Gordon Liddy and Frank Abagnale. This
year we get to show the faculty our taste and in-
telligence.

What problems that have arisen have stemmed
from the shifting responsibility for financing Contact.
The Inter-Fraternity Council started Contact for the
intellectual betterment of the campus, but after
several years has begun to share the responsibility
with the Executive Committee. It is only fair that
each new IFC spend its money as it wishes. This tran-
sition, however, led to confusion, which made all
those concerned look bad.

At first glance, Contact looks bad, only. who is to
blame? Even though letters asking parents for money
did not arrive until Thanksgiving, and even though
the committee’s own members have not been includ-
ed in the entire process, the schedule of speakers is
good.

Charged by the E.C. to redeem the speaker pro-
gram at Washington and Lee, Co-Chairmen Mike
Drinkwater and Robert McLean have bought us some
gems. There is not yet a solid tradition that could con-
tinue itself with its own momentum, nor is there a
reliable source of stimulating oratory, nor is there a
solution to the financial problem. However, there is

hope.
"The Time Story

fhe debate on the merits of coeducation has been
vather mute on this campus this year. Only when
nationally-read Time Magazine discussed all-male
colleges did the subject reawaken. What alarms us is
not that some students oppose coeducation or some
faculty members favor it, but that Washington and
Lee, a university which strives for uniqueness, allow-
ed itself to be amalgamated into a group that included
neck-straining rats and tatooed professors.

One gets an impression from the Time article that
our undergraduate campus (the law school is coed,
mind you) consists of gentlemen (a) opposed to
females searching for higher education in Lexington
and (b) opposed to the recognition of the ‘‘liberated”’
female. Should we assume from the Time article that
Washington and Lee graduates fear the enlightened
female? Do we really think that women are good at
only one profession? These are questions that we
should seriously ponder.

This university’s single gender is a fact of life that
is too multi-faceted to either praise or condemn.
However it is frightening to believe that a student
body of a modern college thinks of females only as
weekend playthings. Does the entire student body
deserve to come across to the nation as a bunch of
minks who like their women out of classes, in skirts
and only in weekend doses? Time apparently conclud-
ed that this would be a fair appraisal of Washington
and Lee.

Some Ideas From Rock Delta Rock

Dear Sir:

I just want to say a few
things:

1. The Time Magazine article
stunk! Of course the ‘‘guys’”’
here are a lot closer, that’s all
girls to wear skirts at all times,
I assume you wear a coat and
I assume you wear a coat and
tie! Hooray for Professor
Hodges. I’m _ glad someone
understands what society and
education are all about today.

2. Where the hell is Contact?
Have they disbanded? They
might as well for all the good
they are doing. I mean this
place is stagnant enough when

Somebody

Dear Sir:

As a parent of a junior at
W&L, I would like to congrat-
ulate you and your staff on your
paper, the Ring-tum Phi.

I look forward to its arrival
with great pleasure, its
editorials and articles.

As a lawyer’s wife of thirty-
eight years, I have been expos-
ed to law students, all sizes

shapes.
John Blossom IV’s letter so
angered me with its immature,

arrogant, self-righteous and
supercilious attitude, I felt it
necessary to write you.

Please continue to be as you
are. You are doing a fine job!

As for Mr. Amsler, continue
to advertise Trojans. It’s
healthy.

ing New York subways (as
predicted) do come to Houston.

it comes to providing for ‘‘men-
tal growth” other than academ-

isn’t going to be an exception. If
this place is supposed to be ‘‘one

(a quote from our friendly
alumni and friends), then let’s
get on the stick and get going. 1

this place with an iron hand and
that I never expect to see girls

time, but I have to admit that I
am very unhappy with the way

Contact Gets Unenthusiastic Approval From EC

(continued from page 1)

Myers asked if the society
had made progress in finding
projectionists that did not
charge, as was discussed at the
original budget hearings in
September.

“We kind of like the fact thar
the law school runs the films,”’
Clarke said. Law student pro-
jectionists charge over ten
dollars a film.

“At two of the films the pro-
jector broke down and we don’t
want to get blamed for breaking
law school projectors,” said
Clarke.
though he was a member of the
committee.

Smith recommended _ that
posters be put up to announce
meetings.

Myers thanked Drinkwater
and McLean, and said the
schedule was good, especially
F. Lee Bailey, who will appear

Feb. 4.

John Martin, co-chaiman of
the Student Activities Board,
told the E.C. that he was trying
to work out a way to get adver-
tising in the school newspaper
at a lower rate.

He reported that at other area
colleges, the student activities
organizations are given free
advertising in the papers.

Martin complained that the

- combined price of several full-

page ads is higher than the

_ price of a band.

Myers added, ‘Advertising

_ has always been a problem with

the SAB, and if they don’t do a
good job publicizing, an event
can flop.”

Ross, Ben Hale, ’84 Rep., and
John Vlahoplus, ’83 Rep., all
noted that it was not the
business of the E.C. to set the
policy of the Ring-tum Phi.

Colloquium Debates Use

Of

The use of opinion testimony
in federal trials was the topic of
a colloquium held Monday in
the Frances Lewis Law Center
of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity’s School of Law.

US. District Judge George
Pratt of the Eastern District of
New York State delivered a
paper on the topic and then led a
discussion.

Pratt, the presiding judge in
all the ABSCAM trials, and the
participants examined the con-
ditions under which opinion
testimony is admissible and the
appropriate procedures for
qualifying an expert witness
under the federal rules of

Opinion Testimony

evidence.

The colloquium was attended
by members of the W&L law
school faculty and W&L law
students. In addition, three
visiting experts in the field were
in attendance — Judge James
C. Turk of Roanoke, Frederick
Lederer of the William and
Mary law _ school, and
Christopher B. Mueller of the
University of Wyoming law
school.

Frederic L. Kirgis Jr., pro-
fessor of law at W&L, is the
director of the Lewis Law
Center which sponsors collo-
quiums and conferences on a
variety of topics throughout the
year.

“John, I'd have to disagree
with you to some extent,” said
Myers. “‘The Phi gets money
from student body funds and we
do have a responsibility to do
something with this.”’

Myers recommended finally
that the SAB and the Ring-tum
Phi work it out between
themselves.

Cutting Clubs’ Funds

Tripp Brower, ’82 — Rep.,
moved that clubs which do not
report to the E.C. as requested
have their funds cut off at the
business office, temporarily,
until they do appear before the
E.C.

The Outing Club missed its se-
cond scheduled appearance,
prompting this measure. The
motion was passed unanimous-
ly. ;

If a club representative does
not show up as scheduled, the
E.C. will freeze the account.
Vouchers cannot be written to
take money out of the account
until the E.C.
treasurer to open the account.

Sub-Committee Reports
Russell Clarke, chairman of
the Film Society, announced
that the third film of the term,
“The Magic Flute” by Ingmar
Bergman, will be shown this

instructs the

weekend.

When the Student Bar Asso-
ciation’s treasurer reported,
Griffith asked if she would look
into finding volunteers to run
the projectors for the Film
Society, which uses the
facilities in Lewis Hall because
it holds more students and is
more comfortable.

The International Club’s
treasurer Emory Edwards
reported that they had helped
sponsor an International Day
Hollins. A trip to Washington,
D.C., was also planned.

The Fencing and Rugby clubs
also reported.

Museum Trustees Meet In Lexington

The 35-member board of
trustees of the Virginia
Museum met in _ Lexington
Thursday (Nov. 19).

According to officials of the
Richmond-based museum, the
meeting marked the first time
in memory that the board had
held a meeting away from Rich-
mond.

The Lexington meeting coin-
cided with the museum’s
special loan exhibition which
opened in Washington and Lee
University’s duPont Gallery on
Tuesday.

The exhibition, ‘Oriental
Splendor: Japanese and
Chinese Decorative Arts,” is
being co-sponsored by Wash-
ington and Lee and the
Rockbridge Chapter of the
Virginia Museum.

The museum’s board of
trustees, comprised of
members from throughout
Virginia, were guests at a
reception in duPont Gallery and

Rule Committee To Convene

The Committee on _ the
Automatic Rule will meet at
10:30 a.m. on Wednesday, Dec.
23, 1981 to consider the
academic records of those

students who have fallen under’

the Automatic Rule:

1. Students who failed to meet
the conditions of Academic Pro-
bation required of them at the
end of the current Fall Term;

2. Students completing a full
academic year who failed to
meet the cumulative average
required of their class.

The Committee will consider
for immediate reinstatement
all students who fall under the
Automatic Rule. If any student
wishes to inform the Committee
of extenuating circumstances,
he may write a letter to the
Committee and deliver it to the
Office of the Dean of the College
before the Committee meets.

In general, the Committee
grants few immediate rein-
statements. A student who falls
under the Automatic Rule has
severed his connection with the
University. If the Committee
does not grant him immediate
reinstatement, he is not eligible

for reinstatement until after the
passage of at least one calendar
year.

As soon as possible after the
Committee’s meeting, each stu-
dent falling under the Auto-
matic Rule will receive a letter
explaining his status.

ACADEMIC PROBATION

Any student not subject to the

Automatic Rule in December

who fails to achieve the
cumulative average required of
him at the end of Fall Term,
1981 (see page 61 in Catalogue),
places himself on Academic
Probation for Winter Term,
1982.

Tyler Guest Lecturer At
Judge Advocate School

Richard B. Tyler, visiting
professor of law at Washington
and Lee University, was a
featured lecturer at the Judge
Advocate General School in
Charlottesville, Va., last month.

Tyler, who is visiting the
W&L School of Law during the
1981-82 academic year while on
leave from the University of
Missouri, examined legal inter-
viewing techniques in his lec-
ture to the legal assistance of-
ficer class.

The audience consisted of 58
military lawyers drawn from
all branches of the service. The
legal assistance officers pro-
vide civil legal assistance to
military personnel and depend-

ents at the major bases both
within the continental United
States and overseas. The legal
assistance officer course is a
one-week refresher on the types
of civil law most frequently en-
countered in such practice for
personnel who have been detail-
ed to such assignments.

Tyler, who has taught at the
University of Missouri Law
School since 1972, is teaching a
course in legal interviewing and
counseling for law students, as
well as corporate law, at W&L.
The course is similar to one
which he has offered for several
years at the University of
Missouri.

Cagers Lose Three

by G.Bruce Potter
Hampden-Sydney College -

handed the Washington and Lee -
their third:

basketball team
defeat in as many outings 55-54
Tuesday night. The three
Generals’ losses, the other two
coming over Thanksgiving
break to UNC-Greensboro 60-58,
and Averett, 49-48, have been by
a total of four points.

How does Head coach Verne
Canfield feel about these set-
backs for his young squad?
“T’m disappointed but not
discouraged in any way,’’ he
said. ‘‘We’ll just have to pa-
tiently keep working on what we
need to work on.”’

The Generals jumped out to a
28-18 lead at the half against H-
SC, and maintained it through-
out the early stages of the se-
cond half. However, with 11:09
remaining, the Tigers rallied
from a 42-31 deficit with a 144
spurt. W&L boosted their lead
to five at 54-49 with 3:09 left, on-
ly to have the Tigers score the
game’s final six points, the win-
ning ticket coming with only
nine seconds on the clock.

Senior George Spears and
sophomore John Graves
paced W&L with 15 and 14

points, respectively. Graves
also pulled down eight rebounds
to lead the squad.

The script was almost exactly
the same for the Generals’
other two losses. Against UNC-
Greensboro, the team was up by
counts of 23-14, 27-18 in the first
half, and, with 10:05 left, led
46-38. However, a little over two
minutes later, the

Generals found themselves
down 48-47, only to come back to
snatch a 56-52 lead with 4:05 re-
maining.

UNC-Greensboro rebounded
for six straight points to take a
58-56 lead with 1:28 on the clock,
but junior Brian Hanson, who
finished with 14 points, sank a
layup to Knot the score. The
Spartans then called a time out
and managed to get off four
shots, until the ball was finally
tapped home as time ran out for
their victory.

Washington and Lee held a
42-36 lead over Averett midway
through the second half, but a
Cougar 13-2 run gave them a
49-44 lead with 1:48 remaining.
Graves, the Generals leading
scorer with 16 points, quickly
sank a basket and two free
throws as W&L pulled within
one with 1:09 left. Ken Jaffe had
a good chance to give the
Generals the lead with three
seconds showing on the clock
but his layup was not good, and
he was called for charging.
Although Averett could not sink
the ensuing free throw, W&L
was unable to get off another
shot before time ran out.

Canfield explained that the
team made a lot of mental
mistakes against Averett and
“deserved to lose.’’ However,
he also felt that the squad
played ‘well enough to win”
against UNC-Greensboro.

Some of the problems were
the team’s forcing the ball, not
making shots, committing turn-
overs (20 against Averett), and

failing to read defenses correct-

ly. In addition, ‘‘the bench is not
contributing as well as we need
it to”’ he said.

After three games, Graves
leads the team with 15.0 points
per game while Spears is
averaging ten points a contest.
Graves is also the rebounding
‘leader at 7.0, followed by junior
Frank Eppes at 6.3. In addition,

Wrestlers

Debut

by Scott Mason

After a less than fruitful
season of a year ago, one mar-
red by injuries and frustration,
the Washington and Lee wrestl-
ing team appears ‘‘young and
hopeful”’ for this year’s season.
Of the ten weight classes, seven
will be occupied by freshmen,
and while experience looms
large against the Generals,
head coach Gary Franke is
looking forward to a promising
year. Those freshmen include
Tom Alleva, Ron Thornton,
Gordon Ogden, David Harrar,
Jeff Dixon, Greg Kendrick, and
Joe O'Neil.
Mark Weaver are also vying for
varsity spots. 158 pound
sophomore Tim Valliere along
with 118 pound senior Elbert
Umila and heavy weight
Carlton Peebles provide the
focal point of the line-up.
Against this backbone, the team
is sure to be a tough competitor.

The Generals have been prac-
ticing for the season since mid
October and were able to test
their ability in November 14th’s
Takedown Tournament at
Madison University. Competing

- with several other surrounding

college teams on an informal
level, W&L wrestlers were
reasonably well prepared and
conditioned for the bout.
Freshmen Tom Alleva at the
126 pound weight class and 167
pound Jeff Dixon particularly
highlighted the day scoring
third and second place finishes,

. respectively.

Lead ’82 Baseball Team

joined the University in the fall
of 1980. This past spring he was
an assistant baseball coach as
the Generals compiled a 10-14
record, the most wins in ten
seasons. Bowers, in his first
year at W&L, is also an assis-
tant_ coach for the football
squad.

Pressler Among All-Americans

ROCHESTER, N.Y. — Mike
Pressler, a four-year defensive
line standout for Washington &
Lee University, was named
Tuesday the Kodak All-
America football team for the
college division II class.

A 5-11, 205-lb. resident of
Wilton, Conn., Pressler started
-at nose guard every game dur-
ing his four-year career and led
the Generals in tackles as a
sophomore and senior. He
received first-team  All-Con-
ference honors from the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference

(ODAC) as a junior and senior,
second-team recognition as a
sophomore.

This past season he collected
65 solo tackles, 20 assists, and
four fumble recoveries to lead a
W&L defense ranked first in the
conference by allowing 226.3
yards per game. He also served
as a team tri-captain to help the
Generals post an 8-2 record,
their best mark since 1962, and
win their first conference
crown.

Pressler becomes the’ second
W&L player to receive the

Kodak award, the first being
wide receiver Tony Perry of
Waynesboro, Va. in 1976. In ad-
dition to his football perfor-
mances Pressler is a three-year
letterman and starter on attack
for the W&L lacrosse team.

The Kodak All-America team
is selected by the American
Football Coaches’ Association.
The 22-member college division
II squad represents the nation’s
best from the NCAA Division III
and NAIA Division II colleges
and universities.

W&L Puts Several On All- ODAC

Washington & Lee Universi-
ty’s football and soccer teams
accounted well for themselves
this past Tuesday, November 17
when the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference presented post-
season awards at its annual fall
meeting held in Staunton, Va.

In football, Generals’ tailback
Chris Cavalline earned the
ODAC Player-of-the-Year
laurel and head coach Gary
Fallon the league’s Coach-of-
the-Year award. Cavalline was
one of eight W&L players
selected to the 24-man All-
Conference first team. Four
Generals received second-team
recognition. ;

In soccer, two W&L standouts
were named to the 11-man All-
Conference first team, one to
the second team.

A junior and three-year let-
terman, Cavalline collected 765
yards and seven touchdowns on
235 carries to finish second in
conference rushing. In addition
he caught 23 passes for 221
yards and punted 36 times for a
35.0-yard average as the
Generals ran up an impressive
8-2 overall record and a 4-1
league mark good for their first
ODAC football title.

He becomes the third General
to win the Player-of-the-Year
football honor, the first being
wide receiver Tony Perry in
1976 and the second linebacker
Car! Folcik in 1978.

Joining Cavalline on the All--

Conference first team were:
sophomore quarterback Al
Paradise, who completed 57.5
percent of his pass attempts for
1014 yards and six touchdowns;
senior tight end Mike Fogarty,
who hauled in a conference-high
31 passes for 418 yards and four
touchdowns; junior offensive
lineman Andy Foley; sopho-
more offensive lineman Glenn
Kirschner; junior place-kicker
Bill Devine, who this past

season entered the W&L record
book in four categories; senior
defensive lineman Mike
Pressler, a four-year starter
who led W&L in tackles and
fumbles recoveries this season,
and junior defensive back
Barry Thompson.

W&L’s four second-team
players were all senior
defensemen: safety Gene
Newton, end Tom Noble,
linebacker John McKee, and
lineman Dave Nickels.

Fallon, who completed his
fourth season at the Generals’
helm, was: the unanimous
choice for conference Coach-of-
the-Year to mark the first time
a W&L director has received

the honor. The owner of a 20-20
mark at the University, Fallon
this past season led W&L to its
best mark since 1962 and to its
first ODAC title.

In soccer, junior Tad Renner
and sophomore Roland Simon
received first-team accolades
for W&L, which finished with a
4-10-1 record this fall. Renner
proved himself a mainstay in
the Generals’ defense while
Simon paced the team in goals
(6) and assists (5). Each player
received or shared four team
Player-of-the-Game honors.

Sophomore Mark Sullivan
received seoond-team All-
Conference soccer recognition.

Page Remillard on the competi-
tion, which includes two diving
events, three relay competi-
tions, and 13 individual events.
“Virginia appears to have the

Turning to his host team,
Remillard reports that ‘‘our

most heavily on Mike Bernot in
the freestyle sprint events, Tim

and in our freestyle relay team.

“But regardless of swimming

Entertainment
A Bergman For Christmas

by Carren O. Kaston

In response to popular de-
mand, the W&L Film Society
will show Ingmar Bergman’s
The Magic Flute (Sweden, 1975:
134 minutes) as a special pre-
Christmas treat. This movie
version of Mozart’s opera will
be screened on Friday and
Saturday, December 4 and 5, at
8:00 p.m., and on Sunday,
December 6, at 1:30 p.m., in
classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis Hall,
free of charge. The sound
system in the room will be
boosted to accommodate this
movie, in which music is so cen-
tral. Translations of the libretto
appear as subtitles.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
composed both orchestral
music and operas, the best

known of which are The Mar-
riage of Figaro (1786), Don
Giovanni (1787), Cosi fan Tutte
(1790), and The Magic Flute
(1791). The Magic Flute is the
last opera Mozart completed
before his death by poisoning at
the age of thirty-five.

Although the opera began by
taking shape as an Oriental fan-
tasy, a type of entertainment
popular at the time, Mozart and
his librettist, Emanuel
Schikaneder, decieded midway
through the composition to
honor the recent death of a
Masonic leader. Both Mozart
and Schikaneder were Free-
masons, and the opera may be
understood, on one level, as an
allegory describing a quest for
Spiritual emancipation and

—_— Film Notes

Psycho (1960) Some of Alfred Hitchcock’s biggest hits were
lavishly produced thrillers with big stars like Cary Grant and In-
grid Bergman or James Stewart and Grace Kelly. This black and
white classic, frequently resembling a Perry Mason re-run, packs a
bigger wallop and is probably better than anything he ever did. The
direction, editing and photography are superb. The famous shower
scene is a stunner no matter how many times you see it, but it helps
if you go in having no idea. The cast includes Anthony Perkins,
Vera Miles, Martin Balsam and poor Janet Leigh. This weekend in
duPont, courtesy of the SAB, at $1a stab.

The Magic Flute (1978) Bergman’s critically acclaimed little
opera, discussed thoroughly in this issue of the Phi. From the Film
Society.

Toma, Citta Aperta (Open City) (1945) Neorealism by Roberto
Rossellini, using real settings and real people to depict real Nazi
oppression, Italian style. He actually moved the cameras in before
the Germans moved out. A powerful film, unrelenting, with a
magnificent performance by the great Italian actress Anna
Magnani. (Ingrid Bergman junkies may be interested to know that
this picture initially attracted the married film queen to Italian
director Rossellini which resulted in an international scandal in
1949). Shown by the journalism department Tuesday at 7 and 9 p.m.
in Reid 203. Admission is free.

psychology is eased here in the
realm of myth.

Bergman’s monumental
Cries and Whispers (1972) was
the movie with which the Film
Society opened its first season,
in 1978. We chose Bergman as
our first director because in the
late 50’s and early 60's,
Bergman’s example helped to
inaugurate a development in
world cinema whose assump-
tions dominate movie-making
and movie-watching to the pre-
sent day. This development is
called the ‘‘French New Wave.”’

The New Wave _ enabled
movies to achieve recognition
as a major art-form. It en-
couraged audiences to regard
films not, as formerly, as show-
cases for star performers, but
as stages in the growth and
career of a director-artist. This
cornerstone of the New Wave is

called the ‘‘auteur’’ (or
‘‘author’’) theory of filmmak-
ing.

In The Magic Flute, a fairy
Queen of the Night sends Prince
Tamino to rescue her daughter
Pamina from the apparently
evil sorcerer Sarastro. Tamino
is accompanied by a buffoonish,
earthbound sidekick, the bird-
catcher Papageno. To ensure
their safety on the mission,
Tamino carries a magic flute
and Papageno silver bells.

The second act reverses the
character values, or offers a se-
cond view of them. Sarastro

now appears as High Priest of
the Temple of Wisdom, and he
is protecting Pamina from her
demonic mother. Tamino and
Papageno must undergo a
series of trials for initiation into
Sarastro’s mystic brotherhood

-and consummation of their

romantic quest. But even
Papageno, who is ultimately
more humanly fallible than he
is enlightened or mystical, is
rewarded with his Papagena.
The plot turns on the theme of
ideal love and partnering:
Tamino/Pamina, and Papa-
geno/Papagena.

Not-So ‘True Confessions ’

by Todd Jones

True Confessions is Robert
DeNiro’s latest film, in which
he co-stars with Robert Duvall.
In the film, DeNiro plays a very
powerful priest, who through
dealing with contractors, has
been able to build schools for
the church for a cheaper-than-
list price. One man, played by
Charles Durning, has saved the
church 5 million dollars.

Robert Duvall plays DeNiro’s
brother. He is a cop working on
a murder case. Before becom-
ing a policeman, he worked as a
bag-boy for Durning, who was a

Presents

Udall
Tuesday

Stewart L. Udall, secretary of
the interior for the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations, will
be the featured speaker for the
first program in Washington
and Lee’s Contact series on
Tuesday, Dec. 8, at 8 p.m. in
Lee Chapel.

Contact is a speaker sym-
posium jointly sponsored by the
Interfraternity Council and the
Student Government at W&L.
Udall’s speech is free and open
to the public.

Currently practicing en-
vironmental law in Washington,
D.C., Udall lectures to universi-
ty and: business audiences on
ecology and energy.

Shortly after being elected to
a fourth term as United States
Representative from Arizon’s
second congressional district,
Udall was appointed by Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy to serve
as the 37th secretary of the in-
terior — a cabinet position he
held throughout the administra-
tions of presidents Kennedy and
Lyndon B. Johnson.

As secretary of the interior,
Udall had wide-ranging respon-
sibilities for the nation’s natural
resources. The ideas he _ in-
itiated and the programs he im-
plemented helped bring the eco-
logical revolution to fruition.

Following the change of ad-
ministrations in January 1969,
Udall formed OVERVIEW, an
environmental consulting firm.
In 1970-72, he was co-author of a
syndicated column on _ en-
vironmental issues.

pimp. He is investigating an
especially grisly murder which
he finds Durning might have
been involved in. Meanwhile,
Durning is given the ‘‘Layman
of the Year Award’’ by the
Catholic Church. Duvall
becomes so angry that he
decides to expose Durning as
being involved in the murder of
this girl (who we find out was a
hooker) even though he knows
Durning is innocent. Duvall
finds out, however, that his
brother was also _ involved
somehow with this girl, and that
if Durning is exposed, DeNiro
will be ruined as well.

   
   
   
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
   
  
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
   
   

Despite an interesting plot,
True Confessions is not a very
good movie. It is too slow mov-
ing. There are scenes in the
movie which could have easily
been omitted. The dialogue does
not always fit the characters: at
one point DeNiro starts cursing
while disrobing after giving
communion. Although DeNiro
and Duvall are both excellent
actors, this film did not display
their talents well enough.

True Confessions has an in-
teresting plot, and good
photography, but is just too
slow-moving to be entertaining.

(continued from page 7)

Udall writes frequently for
periodical magazines. His first
book, ‘The Quiet Crisis,’’ was a
bestseller. In it, Udall advanced
the proposition that “‘“men must
grasp completely the relation-
ship between human steward-
ship and the fullness of the
American earth.’’ He also
authored ‘1976: Agenda for
Tomorrow” and was co-author
of ‘The Energy Balloon.”
