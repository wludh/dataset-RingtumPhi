Plimpton Speaks May 4

Author George Pumpton, one
of the most famous practi-
cioners of ‘participatory jour-
nalism” will speak at Wash-
ington and Lee University on
Tuesday, May 4, at 8p.m. in Lee
Chapel

   

Plimpton’s appearance is.
sponsored by Contact, the.

speaker symposium presented
jointly by the interfraternity
council and the student body at
Washington and Lee.

The author of several books
and numerous articles describ-
ing his participation in a variety
of sports events, Plimpton’s lec-
ture is entitled ‘““An Amateur
Among Pros.”’

Plimpton is most widely
known for his best-selling book
“Paper Lion’ (1966), which

rookie quarterback with the
Detroit Lions of the National
Football League. ‘‘Paper Lion’
was turned into a motion pic-
ture in 1968.

ROTC Giving Most A’s

by Rick Swagler

According to last year’s
Registrar’s report, the depart-
ments giving the most A’s and
B’s were, in descending order,
Military Science, Drama, and
Art. Departments giving the
least number of A’s and B’s

were, in ascending order,
Greek, Mathematics, and
Sociology.

In the Military Science
Department, 66 percent of the
grades given were A’s. In the
Spring, an astonishing 94 per-
cent of all Military Science
grades were A’s. Thorughout
the year, 95 percent of all the
department’s grades were A’s
or B’s.

The Drama Department gave
50 percent of its students A’s in

the fall, compared to 79 percent
for the winter term and 51 per-
cent in the Spring. The average
of both A’s and B’s for the year
was 91 percent.

The Art Department gave 50
percent of its fall students A’s,
compared to ratios of 28 percent
for the winter term and 80 per-
cent in the Spring. The relative-
ly low number of A’s in the
winter was offset by a high
number of B’s (42 percent). The
average of A’s and B’s in the

‘ Art Department was 82 percent,

which was one point higher than
the Music Department.

At the other end of the scale,
the Greek Department topped
the list for least amounts of A’s
and B’s. The Greek Department

Senior Banquet

Staugaitis And Turner:
The Men Of The Hour

Robert M. Staugaitis, a senior
from Farmingdale, N.Y., and
Dr. Charles W. Turner, a pro-
fessor of history at Washington
and Lee, were the main
honorees at Tuesday night’s
Senior Banquet.

Staugaitis, a lacrosse team
captain and head dormitory
counselor, was given the Frank
Gilliam Award. The Gilliam
Award is presented each year to
the student who has made the
most valuable contibution to
student affairs in one or more
fields.

Dr. Turner, who is retiring
from W&L after 36 years of
teaching, was given the William
W. Pusey Award. The Pusey
Award is presented to a faculty
member who has made outstan-
ding contributions to the univer-
sity.

Six people — three students
and three faculty members
—were given Ring-tum Phi
awards. Staugaitis, Michael P.
Bernot, and Nelson Ould were
the student recipients. Dr.
Turner, Isabel MclIlvain, and
President Robert E.R. Huntley
were the faculty recipients.

In accepting the Gilliam
Award, Staugaitis said he was
deeply touched and ‘‘for once,
speechless.’’ Staugaitis said he
had nothing but fond memories
of the university and his only
regret was ‘‘perhaps not

meeting as many people as [|

could.”’ In returning to the
podium for his Phi Award,
Staugaitis said-he again was
speechless.

Upon receiving the Pusey
Award, Dr. Turner said that he

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

A New Rush?

By the time this editorial has been read, the Univer-
sity Council will likely have decided on a rush format
for next year. As of this writing, the most likely for-
mat would be to turn rush into a shorter process (it
would run only four weeks instead of the usual six).
But another feature would be changed. The earliest
date for tearing (accepting a house’s bid) would be
moved up to only three weeks. What the IFC seems to
be advocating is a more climactic rush. Rather than
dragging the thing over six weeks, the IFC will
shorten it to four, with the drama unfolding in the
third.

 

 

Obviously, the system has strengths and
weaknesses. Freshmen will.be exposed to less of a
runaround, but they will also have to go through a
more intense period of rush. Sadly, rush, under this
format, will probably be the three-ring circus that it is
every year.

One of the negative factors of rush is the pressure
that freshmen encounter not only in tearing, but find-
ing the right house. Many freshmen believe they have
failed if they do not find the right house the first time
around. This new format would only extend this
misconception. If a freshman feels pressured in a six-
week schedule, Lord knows what he’ll feel in a four-
week period. , :

The UC is making the right move in trying to adopt
a new format for rush. We only hope that the new for-
mat will not contain the same flaws that caused
displeasure in the old system.

New Rush , Same Problems

by Scott Mason

It is a grave mistake to underestimate the im-
portance of fraternities. Despite their critics,
fraternities, sentimental as they may seem, serve
to unite men in a common bond of friendship that
is forever enduring.

At Washington and Lee, whose campus boasts 16
fraternities whose members exceed 80 percent of
the student body, the importance of houses
becomes intensely magnified. Generally, those
who are least content with W&L are non-fraternity
members.

With this tremendous emphasis upon frater-
nities, it is vital that a carefully-calculated rush
system which gives freshmen ample opportunity
to examine each house individually be instituted.
Washington and Lee’s present rush system falls
far short of allowing this opportunity...

Upon their arrival to W&L, freshmen become in-
stantly embroiled in the rush melee. Among their
initial perils is registering for fraternity open
house. Immediately, they must eliminate seven of
the existing 16 fraternities they wish to visit.
Equipped with minimal information concerning
the rush system and no information whatsoever as
to the “personalities” of each house, these seven
fraternities are eliminated virtually at random.
One of these unlucky seven may, in the end, be the
perfect house a particular freshman candidate is
seeking. Unfortunately, he may never realize this
much less ever step foot inside its door.

As the free-for-all begins with open houses and
rush dates, fraternities are quick to cloak
themselves in a blanket of illusion. Freshmen are
immediately shelled by a barrage of smiling faces
and friendly handshakes followed by the usual
routine repertoire of questions.

The monotony of rush rapidly takes its toll and
freshmen are “encouraged” to make their ‘deci-
sion as early as possible. During this period when

“pledging”’ is first permitted, most freshmen are

marked targets, converged upon by fraternity
members usually representing various houses.
The pressure becomes tantamount, however,
when a freshman, torn between two or more
houses, is unable to resolve his dilemma while
most others have already been successfully induc-
ed to “tear.” As rush begins to fade and November
approaches, that unresolved freshman often may
make a decision of which he remains uncertain. *

Recently, the rush system has, at last, been
scrutinized and proposals to alter the present
system have surfaced. With only weeks now re-
maining before the termination of the academic’
year, a decision concerning changes in the rush
system seems near at hand. Generally, the com-
bined opinions of the Inter-fraternity Council, the
Student Affairs Committee, and the University
Council are being gathered in order to resolve the
issue.

It appears, however, that they are teetering on
the brink of a disastrous decision which would
severely intensify the very same misfortunes that
freshmen are forced to endure under the present
system. Indeed, instead of resolving the problems
that now afflict the present system, the proposed
decision would magnify these problems.

This resolution, expected to be passed by the
University Council tonight (Thursday), involves
shortening rush from six to four weeks. Whereas
freshmen are now permitted to pledge during the
pledge at the start of approximately the third

week. Preceding this ‘“‘intensivied shortened:
rush” would be an extensive orientation period
designed to acquaint freshmen with the
mechanics of rush and inform them of the rules
and process of the rush system.

The idea of shortening rush is merely a means of
placing quickly an end to the rush process as is
possible, admits the Student Affairs Committee.
In recommending this policy, the committee has

Nostalgia With A Sentiment

As is the case with any affair that involves
either soon-to-be graduates or alumni, the Senior
Banquet was a combination of nostalgia, a few
touching moments, and a smattering of fund rais-
ing. The seniors who chose to attend Tuesday
night’s supper in Evans Dining Hall were treated
to a little recognition for surviving four years of
W&L, and then were given their first dose of dona-
tion requests from the alumni office.

The evening began innocently enough in the
Alumni House, where cocktails at 6, combined
with pre-banquet anxiety and an empty stomach,
left more than a fair share of banqueteers light-
headed. The scene at the alumni house was enough
to bring smiles to the faces of Alvin Carter and
Joseph Bank. Seniors and third-year law students
were clad in blue blazers, solid-color shirts, and
patterned ties. Nothing seems to bring out a crowd
as does an open bar, and the four bartenders in the
Alumni House worked straight from 6-7 p.m.

After being herded across campus to the dining
hall, the banqueteers had to creep through a
security check, where one gargantuan basketball
player peered ominously down on would-be smug-
glers. The dinnner itself was your basic banquet
fare — chicken and rice, with a choice of veggies.
Most students learned of seconds only after most
of the chicken was gone. After approximately 45
minutes of dining and conversation, the festivities
began.

Bill Washburn, alumni secretary, was the
emceee for the evening. Washburn provided the
guests with a few snappy introductions and some
vintage-1940 humor. Washburn introduced the
first speaker, Politics Professor John Handelman,
whose refelctions on W&L were perhaps the
highlight of the evening. Handelman’s speech, a
combination of digs at his fellow professors and an
emphasis on the value of maintaining contact with

the university, was warmly received by the au-
dience.

Speaking next was Dean of Students Lewis John,
who presented the Gilliam Award. The recipient,
senior Rob Staugaitis, gave a humble
“‘speechless’”’ speech in which he praised the
school. It was the first of two trips to the podium
for Staugaitis who later received a Ring-tum Phi
Award.

John Viahoplus, a junior and member of the Ex-
ecutive Committee, next presented the William W.
Pusey Award. The recipient, Dr. Charles W.
Turner, was also a two-time winner as he later
was given a Ring-tum Phi Award. Dr. Turner, ina
rather misty voice, accepted the award with a
brief yet polite response.

The Ring-tum Phi Awards were last on the agen-
da. The Phi’s Editor read, er, announced the
awards, which were given not only to Staugaitis
and Dr. Turner, but also to Mike Bernot, Nelson
Ould, Isabel Mcllvain and W&L President Robert
E.R. Huntley. President Huntley received a two-
minute standing ovation as he accepted the award
and asked the banqueteers to sit down, saying they
were about to ‘‘make a grown man cry.”’ Huntley
did not give a long speech, saying he would save
his comments for June’s graduation ceremonies.

The banquet had come and gone by 8:45, after
Buddy Atkins paid notice to the alumni pamphlet
all diners were given. Somewhere in this speech
was a veiled message of fund-raising, but Atkins,
like other speakers, developed the theme of keep-
ing in touch with the alumni office.

As are most alumni affairs, Tuesday night’s
banquet was slick, orderly and generally en-
joyable. For most seniors, it was a chance to get
together with old friends and remember the good
ole days.

White Hopes For

Minority Increase

by B. Scett Tilley

Despite federal cuts in stu-
dent aid programs and keener
competition in minority recruit-
ing on the national level, Direc-
tor of Minority Affairs John
White is pleased with the quan-
tity and quality of this fall’s
minority class.

In September White had a
potential prospect pool of 144
students, a number he describ-
ed as “deceptive.” From that
pool 24 applications were
received and 12 accepted. White
unofficially expects about nine
of these students to confirm ac-
ceptance, up one from last year,
but down six from the fifteen
black students who enrolled in
the fall of 1980.

White noted that academical-
ly, “this is one of the stronger
minority classes we’ve had.”
The average SAT scores for
those accepted is 480 verbal and
500 math, and the average class
rank is in the 72nd percentile.

The majority of recruitment
of black students takes place

Fencing Club David Hepler also
gave his last report to the E.C.
as its season closed with a no-
show by the University of
Virginia with its final record
standing at two wins, four
losses, and three cancellations.
Hepler presented the Club’s
modest budget, closing with ap-
proximately $25 left in the ac-
count and also announced that
one team member, sophomore
Rick Swagler, is still training
for the national competition to
take place June 2.

Junior secretary and presi-
dent-elect of the E.C. Bennett
Ross raised the issue for the
Cold Check Committee that
payment would soon stop on stu-
dent’s bad checks in a move to
save outstanding debts from be-
ing carried over the summer.

After a motion by rep. Morgar

imously voted to stop payment
of such checks on Friday, May
14.

Eric Kolts, Chairman of the
Student Emergency Loan Com-
mittee, appeared to present its
monthly report. With fifteen
loans partially or wholly
outstanding, Kolts stated that

Testing Service Minority Stu-
dent Search, through athlete
recruitment, the Black Alumni
Committee, and high school
visitation are also important,
according to White.

White added, ‘‘Nationally,
there has been a decline in the
number of blacks at predom-
inately white schools and a
return to predominately black
campuses. With the cut in stu-
dent aid funds, black schools’
aid programs will also suffer.”

He sees the possibility of an
increase in interest in W&L
though, citing two reasons: a
more concentrated effort by the
University to recruit blacks,
and an increase in financial
awards for minority students
here. Two new grants have been
added this year.

In support of these hopes, he
noted that the preliminary in-
terest search for the class of ’87
exceeds 200 students already,
an all-time high. He hopes to ex-
ceed 40 applications for the first
time, but added that it is ‘‘Un-
predictable, at best.”

Tennis, Track To Host ODAC Finals

Netmen Are ‘Dark Horse’
Behind H-SC , Lynchburg

by David Stuart

The climax of the 1981 tennis season begins
tomorrow as Washington and Lee hosts seven
other Old Dominion Athletic Conference teams in
the two-day ODAC tournament.

‘“‘We are the dark horse here,”’ admitted head
coach Gary Franke, speaking of his squad’s
chances of capturing the conference title. Franke
figured if two of his six players won their flights,
four were finalists, and at least two won third
place, they could win the event.

The tournament is structured so that the eight
number one players representing each of the
teams will compete against each other, making up
a flight. There will be six singles flights and three
doubles flights in the tourney.

The flight winners earn eight team points, and
each quarterfinalist picks up one point. Three con-
solation rounds are played to decide three and
four, five and six, and seven and eight ranks in the
championship. Of course, the team with the most
cumulative points wins the ODAC title.

Tournament seedings will be decided at a
coaches’ meeting to be held tonight. Washington
and Lee lost to Hampden-Sydney 8-1 and Lynch-
burg 7-2 last week but the final seeding of the top
three contenders could not be determined until
Lynchburg and Hampden-Sydney played a match
yesterday.

Freshman Andy Haring (number five) was the

only General to win a singles match against Lyn-
chburg, thus securing himself at least a number
two seed in the tournament. Coach Franke
remarked that ‘‘Haring is the most capable of any
to win” at the ODAC’s.

In doubles, the number one pair of Craig Cannon
and Charlie Kalocsay were the only W&L winners
against Hampden-Sydney on Thursday. They lost
at Lynchburg, however, so the Hampden-Sydney-
Lynchburg match will decide their seeding.

Conversely, the number two doubles duo of Wes
Yonge and Jim Irwin won against Lynchburg but
lost at H-SC. Franke marks them as a second seed.

What about the other five ODAC teams,
Roanoke, Bridgewater Emory and Henry, Mary-
ville and Randolph-Macon? Maryville is strong
in football and Roanoke in basketball, but in tennis
the “‘strength of the ODAC” lies predominantly
with Washington and Lee, Hampden-Sydney and
Lynchburg.

Though the Generals have only played three
ODAC teams this season, they have consistently
been top contenders for the conference title. This
year, aside from those losses to H-SC and Lynch-
burg, W&L beat Emory and Henry 8-1.

The championship singles finals are scheduled
for 1 p.m. Saturday. The time, however, is subject
to change depending on the length of matches and
the weather.

Losses Kill Baseball’s Tourney Hopes

by Andrew P. Hoppes

W&L’s baseball team
defeated conference rival
Bridgewater, but lost double-
headers to Emory & Henry and
William & Mary this past week.

As of Tuesday, the Generals’
record stood at 8-15 overall and
5-8 in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference.

In order to have qualified for
the ODAC tournament (May 1),
the Generals had to beat Lynch-
burg today and hope for a
Bridgewater loss in their final
game. However, that game was
cancelled and will not be
rescheduled, thus knocking
W&L out of the playoff picture.

Last Wednesday, the
Generals greatly improved
their playoff chances with a 12-9
extra-inning win at Bridge-
water. Senior Rich Hachenberg
pitched the last five innings to
earn the win.

W&L turned in a superb per-
formance offensively with three
three-run innings. Senior Jeff
Haggerty led the attack with

‘four hits and four runs-batted-

in, including a home-run.

One of W&L’s three-run inn-
ings came in the top of the ninth
as the Generals seized the lead,
9-8. Haggerty rapped a key two-
RBI double in the inning.

After Bridgewater tied the

score in the bottom of the ninth,
the Generals won the game with
three runs in the llth. The
Generals took advantage of
several Bridgewater errors in
the inning.

Last Friday, the Generals
traveled to Emory & Henry
where they lost two league con-
tests to the Wasps (4-1 and 13-2).
“We only got seven hits in the
doubleheader,”’ noted W&L
coach Jim Murdock.

In the first game, senior Dave —

Randall yielded only one earned
run. But the weak General hit-
ting hurt Randall. Senior Thad

, W&L Golfers
Take Third

by B. Scott Tilley

The problem of bad first-day
performances once again
reared its ugly head and spelled
defeat for the Washington and
Lee golf team this week in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference .championships at
Wedgewood Country Club in
Farmville, Va.

Led by senior co-captains Jim
Kaplan and Bill Alfano, who
each earned all-Conference
honors, the Generals turned in
the best second-day perfor-
mance of the tournament, a 296,
to give them a total of 613 and
third-place in the event, only
two strokes behind champion
Lynchburg.

The Generals turned in a 317
Monday, miring themselves in
fourth place in the six-team
tournament, 14 strokes off the
pace, Roanoke, bidding for its
third straight ODAC title, led by
two strokes after Monday’s ac-
tion but finished with a 309 for a
total of 612, one stroke behind
Lynchburg and one ahead of
W&L.

UNC Downs ‘Armadillo’;

Generals Meet Syracuse

by John Harrison

Bizarre. Bush league. In-
novative. Garbage. What had to
be done to win.

These were some of the
descriptions used by both sides
following last Saturday’s
lacrosse match on Wilson Field,
in which North Carolina scored
four of the last five goals to
escape with an 11-8 decision.

Earlier in the week head
coach Jack Emmer had said,
‘“‘We’re not going to go out there
and just play the game. We’re
going to try to control the tempo
and use some strategies.”’

This stratagem that kept

fans, players, and coaches from —

both schools talking about the
game was the ‘‘Armadillo’’ for-

eels.

Senior Rob Staugaitis helpea
put W&L ahead 2-0 in the first
five minutes by beating Tom
Sears, a U.S. World Games par-
ticipant, with a high hard shot
and then fed freshman Jeff
Mason with an alert centering
pass which Mason quickly put
behind the Carolina goalie.

Defenseman Dave Nickels
made it 3-0 seven minutes later
when he started a solo rush
from the right sideline and let
go a shot that somehow manag-
ed to go in between Sears’ leg
and the left post.

UNC came back to score
three goals of its own less than
two minutes after Nickels had
tallied. ;

Mike Burnett created the first
tie of the day at 1:57 when he
brought the ball inbounds from
behind the W&L goal, moved to
Ware Palmer’s left and circled
in mid-air while releasing his
shot into the net.

After John Sancilio and Ward
Steidle »xchanged goals in the
opening minute of the second
quarter, midfielder Jeff Homire
gave Carolina its first lead, 5-4,
when he beat Phil Aiken with a
high 15-yarder. Aiken replaced
Palmer after UNC’s third goal.

The sophomore made 14
saves on 22 shots and was most
impressive near the end of the
first half when he made three
consecutive saves, none of
which was routine. One save
was a deflection and the second
was a leg block on a low
bouncer.

“He (Aiken) had a fine
game,” noted head coach Jack
Emmer,. The coach added that
Aiken would have to work on
‘creating a period of consisten-
2y’’ in the future, however.

Immediately after Homire
made it 5-4, the ‘“‘Armadillo’”’
formation, which the Generals
used several times briefly in the
first quarter, went into full ef-
fect. For a solid nine minutes
(and eight-and-a-half more in
the third quarter), W&L held
the ball by giving it to a mid-
fielder and surrounding him

completely with five team-
mates.

“We don’t regret doing it,’’
said Emmer. ‘‘We had to give
our guys a reason to believe we
could win.”’

And the Generals did almost
pull off the upset. Going into the
fourth quarter behind 7-6, they
rallied to tie the score on a goal
by John Doub at the 14:12 mark.

However, the Tar Heels
scored three straight goals, as
W&L failed to convert on
several man-up situations, to
take a 10-7 lead with just 4:38
left. The teams then traded
goals to make the final margin.

According to the coach., a
discussion among members of
the U.S. Intercollegiate
Lacrosse Association Rules
Committee (of which he is a
member) produced no official
decision either way on whether
a team can hold the ball in the
manner W&L did. So, at this
point, the “Armadillo” might
reappear next season.

The Generals don’t return to
Wilson Field until Spring
Weekend (Saturday, May 8)
against Hofstra University of
Long Island.

This Saturday, W&L will be in
the Carrierdome to take on the
Syracuse Orangemen. In Syra-
cuse, the Generals could be
playing a team that is either
overconfident or reaching its
peak at the end of the season.

“They beat Army (number
two in the polls at the time)
13-11 last week,’’ Emmer
pointed out. “They’re very
talented, but they’ve been in-
consistent this season.’’ A loss
to Division III Cortland State is
an example of Syracuse’s incon-
sistency.

W&L then goes to Salem
Wednesday, May 12, to play
Roanoke College.

“They’re a quick, feisty
team. They had us down 9-2 last
year before we rallied. But their
schedule hasn’t brought out the
best in them,’”’ remarked Em-
mer,

Game time is 3 p.m.

‘Cria’ Headlines For Film Society

by Richard Grefe
and Carren Kaston

The Washington and Lee Film
Society is happy to announce
that Richard Grefe, Reference
and Public Service Librarian at
the University Library, will
succeed Carren Kaston as
Faculty Adviser of the
organization, beginning with
next year’s season. The Film
Society will, in addition, be
strengthened by a generous
grant from the Glasgow Endow-
ment Fund towards next year’s
operating expenses. The pur-
pose of the Fund is ‘‘to promote
the art of expression by pen and
tongue.”’

The next-to-last presentation
in this season’s Film Society
series is the beautiful Spanish
film Cria (Spain, 1977: 115
minutes), written and directed
by Carlos Saura. The film will
be shown in classroom ‘“A”’ of
Lewis Hall at 8 p.m. on Friday,
April 30, and Saturday, May 1,
free of charge.

Cria is a movie from the ‘‘new
Spain,’ Spain since Franco’s
death in 1975. The resulting
greater freedom in the arts is
evident in cinema particularly

in the work of “ose Luis Borau
— Furtivos (Spain, 1975) — and
Saura, who is typically drawn to
the subject matter of childhood.

Cria ‘‘stars’’ Geraldine
Chaplin, but the film is
dominated by the haunting per-
formance of Ana Torrent as
Ana, a 9-year-old girl growing
up in contemporary Madrid. In
her short life, Ana has already
witnessed her mother’s agoniz-
ing death from cancer and her
widowed father’s death in the

‘ embrace of another woman.

Thus orphaned, Ana and her
two young sisters become
charges of a somewhat indif-
ferent aunt and lead lives of fan-
tasy framed by the realities of
their new situation.

This is no Walt Disney child-
hood. Saura has said, “I have
never believed in the child’s
paradise. On the contrary, I
think that childhood is a stage
where nocturnal terror, fear of
the unknown, loneliness are
present with at least the same
intensity as the joy of living and
that curiosity of which
pedagogues talk so much.”’

Despite his concern with the:
darker side of childhood, Saura

does not dwell upon the ‘‘sad”’
— both the: sinister and the
joyful are presented with the
same wide-eyed innocence of
the child. Our own memories re-
mind us that childhood is a
series of overlapping ex-
periences of mystery and
awareness; and Cria excels in
conveying these sensations as
we share with Ana her own
past.

Like most children, Ana sees
and understands — in a murky
way — much more than she is
given credit for. Surely, it is this
adult-insensitivity to children’s
awareness that causes many of
the problems associated with
“raising” children. (The film’s
title comes from the Spanish
proverb ‘‘Cria cuervos y te

“Bring up crows and they will
peck your eyes out.’’) The emo-

exterior is made evident by the
periodic reappearance of her

Chuck Norris is starring in his
latest adventure-thriller, Silent
Rage. Silent Rage is not your
average Chuck Norris film.
Director Mike Miller decided to
turn the movie into a pseudo-
psycho horror film. Unfor-
tunately, he did not succeed. ** «

Chuck Norris plays a cop ina
small town. The town is not too
small to have an extensive
laboratory, and certainly not
too small.to have a homicidal
maniac.

Our crazy friend, Ron Silver,
is seen at the beginning of the
movie standing at a phone tell-
ing the doctor, ‘I can’t stand
it,” while children are dancing

about him
Our maniac then calmly

goes outside, gets an ax, and
chops the parents %

The police arrive, in time to
put about forty bullets into our

friend, the killer. The next
scene shows three doctors
hovering around a table
remarking, ‘‘He’s alive.”’ Then,
to add a unique twist to the film,
the doctor injects a ‘“super-
drug”’ into our killer, and he is
now a superhuman mongoloid
who immediately recovers
from any bullet would or stab-
bing.

Finally, Chuck sets out to
“get’”’ our pal, the homicidal
maniac. Naturally, — inters-
persed throughout the film, is
Chuck’s romance with a girl
whose intelligence is only sur-
passed by our friend, the
homicidal maniac. While he
spends his whole time in the
film grunting, she spends hers
squealing and screaming.

Not only is this film not scary,
but Norris does little Kung-Fu,
his tradmark in his earlier
films. He is also supproted by a
uniformly untalented cast.

Those interested in helping
the CROP hunger walk, either
by walking or pledging a
walker, can receive more infor-
mation by calling 291-2985 or
463-7870.

In conjunction with the CROP
walk, the Inter-Varsity Chris-
tian Fellowship group will be
designating May 3-7 as World
Hunger Week. Throughout the
week, cans will be provided on
campus and in fraternity

houses. for those who wish to
help eliminate world hunger. .

In addition, Wednesday, May
5, has been designated as World
Hunger Day. Gerry Darrell of
Evans Dining Hall has
volunteered to donate the raw
food cost for everyone who will
give up the evening meal on this
day. Law students and fraterni-
ty houses are also being asked
to participate. Fifty percent of
this money will be donated to a
local organization, the Com-
munity Pantry, and the other
half will go to World Vision In-
ternational.

Frank Williams, who is help-
ing to coordinate the evenis
along with Kelly Moles, Nelson
Ould, and Brook Wright, said,
“We would like to encourage
everyone to participate on
Wednesday and Saturday, but
more even than this, to serious-
ly consider developing a life-
style that confronts rather than
ignores the present world food
crisis.”

Reveals Virginity Lost

The anonymously-admini-
stered poll, indicated that most
of the sexual experiences of
students grew out of love for
their partner.

Eighty-eight percent of those
who had lost their virginity had
done so with their boyfriend,
but 62 percent of those were no
longer dating the same person.
Most of the students have never
had a one-night stand.

The majority of students lost
their virginity between the ages
of 16-19. Forty-three percent of
the non-virgins had sex with on-
ly one partner. 35 percent have
had 2-5 partners, with the re-
maining percentages left for
those with multiple partners.

Of the sexually-active, 75 per-

cent used contraceptives, with
the pill being the most common
type of birth control. Only 10
percent of those who don’t use
contraceptives do so because of
religion, but 4 percent used
withdrawal as a contraceptive.

Eight percent of those
answering the poll considered
themselves lesbians. Of that
group, 6 percent had made love
to another woman and three
percent considered themselves
bisexual.

Please note: this poll was a
random sample of the student
body, taken anonymously.
These figures may be compared
to a similar poll conducted dur-
ing the 1979-1980 year.

Professors Discuss
Math And Computer

Two members of Washington
and Lee University’s mathe-
matics department, Wayne M.
Dymacek and Robert L. Wilson
Jr., participated in a special
regional meeting of the

Mathematical Association of
America earlier this month.

The meeting was devoted to
the relation of mathematics and
mathematics education to com-
puting.

mathematicians and students
from Virginia, Maryland, and
the District of Columbia.

was recognized for ‘‘outstan-
ding service work in both the
W&L and Lexington com-

final candidates.

Thus far in the search, the
committee has received 186
nominations and applications
for the position. The vacant
position was advertised in the
Chronical of Higher Education
with a deadline of April 15 and
Dean Watt said there had been
only a few late applications. In
addition, 600 schools listed in
the American Association of
Colleges and the American
Association of Universities as
well as all of the schools in the
state of Virginia were notified
of the opening.

Dean Watt stated that ‘‘the
overwhelming majority”’ of the

applicants had formerly held
positions in the academic pro-
fession.

“A strong leader effective in
both academics and capital

fund-raising,” is how Dean Watt,

describes the man for whom
they are looking. Watt also
mentioned that capital building
would not be at the level it had
been at for the last ten years, in
the wake of a successful $67
million dollar fund raising drive
executed by President Huntley.
Watt also noted that the tran-
sition of activity will now move
from the search committee to
the selection committee as the
candidate pool is nearly com-
plete and the tedious task of
qualification remains.

“fulfills Everyman’s ambition
of challenging the champions,”’
Plimpton’s experience with the
football Lions was not his first
exercise in ‘‘participatory jour-
nalism.”’ Nor was it his last.

At various times during his
career, Plimpton has boxed
against light heavyweight
champion Archie Moore, played
tennis against Oswald Jacoby,
pitched against a series of ma-
jor league baseball players,
played goalie for the Boston
Bruins of the National Hockey
League, and toured as an
amateur golfer on the profes-
sional golf tour.

“Out of My League,”’ his 1961
book, describes Plimpton’s
baseball experience while ‘‘The
Bogey Man’’ (1968) chronicles
his exploits on the pro golf tour.

Plimpton, a graduate of Har-
vard University where he ma-
jored in English and was editor
of the Harvard Lampoon, has
not limited himself to sports
endeavors. He signed on as a
percussionist with the New
York Philharmonic in 1968.
That experience served as the
basis of a television special en-
titled ‘‘The Secret Musical Life
of George Plimpton.’

Among Plimpton’s books are

In Sunday’s doubleheader at
William & Mary, the Generals

First, courses such as Math

consequently, may have par-

New Rush

(continued from page 2)
enormous weight which a freshman’s decision
often bears. Choosing the proper fraternity will, in
theory, affect his happiness with W&L as a whole
during his four-year stay. Shortening rush would
not give him near-enough adequate time in which
to make this crucial decision.

Yet, argue the Student Affairs Committee and
Inter-fraternity Council, this extensive orientation
period will sufficiently prepare freshmen for their
indoctrination into the helter skelter rush system.
While this so-called orientation period will un-
doubtedly be useful in explaining the basic format
and regulations of rush, it is unable to provide the
kind of ‘“‘feeling”’ freshmen capture when they in-
teract with members of a particular fraternity.
The orientation period is a farce, simply a means
of justifying a shortened rush. Although it will in-
form freshmen candidates of house academic and
intra-mural standings, it cannot give to freshmen
that which is most important in their decision-
making process — namely this genuine gut senti-
ment.

Allowing freshmen to pledge earlier (at the start
of the third week of rush) is yet another danger ex-
istent in the proposed system. Many freshmen will
face no dilemma and will be immediately certain
of the house they wish to join. When the third week
of rush begins, they will be allowed to join the
house they prefer. However, many freshmen will
be unable to decide which house to join. As the
fourth week of rush begins and more freshmen
“tear,” these undecided candidates will feel a
growing pressure to follow suit and resolve the
issue by pledging a fraternity. Often this pressure
reaches unbelievable proportions, and, yet, it is all
the more intensified to the first-year college

newcomer who is still wholly unadapted to his new :

environment. This pressure cannot be exag-

gerated and is often traumatic as evidenced by
those who, realizing their hasty decision, undergo
taken into account little consideration as to the
the agonizing process of depledging a fraternity.
By relocating earlier in the month the date at
which freshmen are permitted to tear, the already
inadequate time they have for making a confident
choice becomes greatly more inadequate.

The lack of a thorough study on behalf of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee, University Council, and
Inter-fraternity Council in dealing with changes in
the rush system is astonishing. They have acted
with closed minds and have made only feeble at- —
tempts to study the various systems of other col-
leges. Moreover, many of the faculty involved in
the decision-making process are uninformed of
the way in which the system operates and the
rules governing the system (such as the no contact
rule). Consequently, they are not qualified to
make this kind of important decision. Other op-
tions do indeed exist which would reform the
system such that neither the financial burden of
fraternities nor the pressure placed upon
freshmen is increased. The committees engaged
in resolving the rush issue, however, have failed to
probe these options.

If, as proposed, an intensified shortened rush
system, preceded by an extensive orientation
period, is passed, a very grave mistake will have
been committed. With the academic year nearing
an end, the committees involved in finalizing the
proposal are eager to put the issue at rest. The
lack of time with which they have to make a deci-
sion seems likely to determine any resolution a
hasty one. It will not only be a great set-back to the
rush system if the proposal is passed, but also a
tragic shame.

The author, a sophomore, will serve as a member of
next year’s Executive Committee.
