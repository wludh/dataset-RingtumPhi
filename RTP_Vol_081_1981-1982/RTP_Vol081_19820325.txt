Investigators Examining

LPD Role In Theft Ring

Four Lexington policeman and a Rockbridge
County deputy were suspended from duty yester-
day in the latest development in the probe of a
local theft ring that allegedly involves past and
present members of the Lexington Police Depart-
ment.

Yesterday, Lexington Police Chief James A.
Kirby suspended the following officers from his
squad: Lt. W.F. “‘Bill’’ Knick, Lt. J.K. ‘‘Joe’’ Col-
bert, Officer T.H. ‘‘Tony’ Clark, and Officer
Donald E. Stubblefield. Kirby said that the of-
ficers were suspended from the police force ‘‘pen-
ding the completion of (the) investigation.”

In addition to the four Lexington police officers,
Lt. Carl H. Emore of the Rockbridge County
Sheriff’s Department was also suspended from his
duties. Emore is a two-and-a-half year veteran of
the department.

With yesterday’s suspensions, the number of
past and present officers now being investigated
totals 10. The list includes Knick, Colbert, Stub-
blefield, Clark, Elmore, and Hamilton. Also in-
cluded on the list is Barry Flint, whose statements
to investigators revealed the theft ring. Jack Pur-
vis, a ten-year veteran of the L.P.D. who retired in
1980, is also on the list.

An article in this morning’s Roanoke Times &
World News said that in addition to the policemen
suspended yesterday, investigators are looking at
two more former Lexington police officers, one of
whom is working in a nearby law jurisdiction.

Of the five officers suspended yesterday, Knick
had the longest amount of service, having worked
for the L.P.D. since 1949. Of the remaining of-
ficers, the length of duty ranges from two to ten
years.

’ The disclosures of the theft ring began last week
when Flint agreed to accept immunity from fur-
ther charges in exchange for cooperating with in-
vestigators. Flint had been found guilty of stealing
$280 from Hop-In in 1977. Flint’s statement was
taken by state police investigators, but Com-
monwealth’s Attorney Beverly C. ‘John’ Read
asked for additional investigators on Tuesday.

The Times & World News also reported this
morning that Read would ask that a grand jury be
reconvened to consider the charges in the in-
vestigation.

How It All Began

by Bill France
On March 15, Barry Flint. 32. an ex-Lexington
policeman, began to cooperate with state in-
vestigators after being granted immunity to fur.
ther allegations of a police theft ring in Léxington.

Earlier that day, Flint had been given a three-
year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to

the theft of $280 from the Hop-In convenience store —

in 1977.

Commonwealth Attorney Beverly C. ‘John’
Read said that he recommended a jail sentence
for Flint to. Lexington Circuit Court Judge
Rudolph Bumgardner. Read also said there was
no plea bargaining involved. Read said Bumgard-
ner justified the sentence by sighting that it was
Flint’s first offense.

Although an undisclosed number of past and
present Lexington policeman are being _in-
vestigated in connection with theft ring allega-
tions, a Roanoke paper quoted Read as saying
“Lexington’s got one of the finest police depart-
ments there is.”’ Since the time Read made that
comment, five past and present officers have been
suspended from police duties pending investiga-
tion of the theft ring.

Read called in state police investigators in
November after hearing about an internal police
department investigation of the Hop-In theft from
a reporter. Until then, the matter had been con-
cealed by the police department.

Flint resigned when the state investigators were
called into the case. His lack of cooperation with
the state police brought an end, at that time, to the
investigation.

A Virginia State Police Trooper was suspended from duty Tues-
day in connection with the Rockbridge County Commonwealth At-
torney’s investigation of the Lexington Police Department.

State Trooper Marvin Hamilton was suspended from duty Tues-
day pending further investigation.

Hamilton had been a Lexington police officer for eight years
prior to his service with the State Police.

On Monday afternoon, Lexington Police Chief James A. Kirby
met with four state police investigators and Commonwealth At-
torney Beverly C. “John” Read.

Read said the conference was held to inform Kirby of the latest
developments on the investigation of allegations that a theft ring
has been operating out of the Lexington Police Department for
several years.

Read said Kirby was ‘‘provided with substantial inforamtion at
the time state police investigators met with him yesterday.”

Read said that the State Police had been provided with the same
type of information given to Kirby, and that based on information
given to the state police, Hamilton was suspended.

“TI cannot comment as to why Kirby did not do the same,’
Read.

Reading from a prepared statement, Kirby said Tuesday that he
has “requested the Commonwealth’s Attorney to furnish me
evidence to support any allegations by Lexington police offiecers.
As of this time, I have not received the evidence.

“If and when I receive sufficient evidence to support the allega-
tions being made, I will take prompt and firm action in accordance
with the law,”’ said Kirby.

Kirby indicated that the information provided to him by the in-
vestgators did not warrant suspension of Lexington police officers.

Read also said that additional state police officers had been
brought in to help with the investigation on Tuesday.

“This theft ring, operating out of the Lexington Police Depart-
ment, has been going on for years,” said Read. He pointed out that
he did not learn of the allegations until last week.

Read said the additional investigators are needed to bring the in-
vestigation to an ‘‘expeditious”’ termination.

The investigation began with indormation given to the State
Police by former Lexington police officer Barry Flint.

On March 15, Flint pleaded guilty to the theft of $280 from the
Hop-In store on N. Main St. in June, 1977.

Circuit Court Judge Rudolph Bumgardner sentenced Flint to a’
three-year suspended sentence and placed him on probation. The
terms of Flint’s probation have not yet been determined by the
court,

Flint was interviewed for two hours by state police investigators
immediately after the trial.

Ford Defends Reagan In Macon Speech

by John Wells

Former President Gerald R.
Ford expressed general support
for the policies of the Reagan
administration during remarks
in Lynchburg on Tuesday.

The ex-president met with
reporters while visiting Ran-
dolph Macon Woman’s College
for a day of speeches and ap-
pearances.

Ford said President Reagan
should stand firm on his budget
and tax cut proposals, which he
said would lead to an eventual
economic recovery.

“For the president to
capitulate to short-term
political gain would be bad for
the economy,” Ford said ‘“‘What
we’re going through now is the

 

Former President Gerald R.
Ford at R-MWC.

 

Ford said the success of GOP
candidates this fall would be
tied to the economy, but he feels
that a certain economic upturn
will be advantageous.

The former president sug-
gested the huge projected
budget deficit could be reduced
by cutting the growth of defense
spending.

“I’m a hawk, always have
been, and I’m proud of it,’”’ Ford
reminded the gathering of
reporters. He said Reagan can
“spread out defense  pro-
curements’’ to “‘slow down the
cash outflow.” He predicted
such a move would arouse
squawks from the Pentagon,
which he termed ‘“hogwash.”’

build-up, said Ford, without en-
dangering the national defense.

Ford also supports his suc-
cessor’s Central American
policy and said he opposes a
negotiated settlement of the
conflict in El Salvador. Such
negotiations, he said, only serve
to invite the Soviet Union into
the hemishpere.

The former president said he
sees no reason to compare the
situation in El Salvador to U.S.
involvement in Vietnam. He
reeled off statistics of
geography and population tc
support his contention.

Asked about the Middle East
Ford said he supports the con-
clusion of the Camp David Ac-

further negotiations between
Israel and moderate Arab na-

tions.’’ No comphrehensive set-
tlement will be
reached at any single

negotiating table, he said.

Ford virtually acknowledged
the frequent charge that the
Reagan administration has no
Middle East policy by saying ‘‘I
hope they’1l come up.with one.”’

The 38th president looked tan-
ned and relaxed, as the cliche
goes, in a black and white plaid
suit. He fielded questions easily
and answered questions ade-
quately and, for the most part,
predictably.

He said the proposal by Soviet

26 Candidates Compete In Run-Off Today

by J.R. Smith

Only one campus position was
won in this week’s elections, but
26 candidates fared well enough
to make Thursday’s run-off
vote, the Executive Committee
announced in its meeting Mon-
day night.

Jeff Londrey won the election
for Senior vice-president of the
science majors, by only a three
vote margin. Of course,
only 15 votes were counted from
science majors. Score: Jeff
Londrey - 9, Bob Marshall - 6.

In the senior class elections
for E.C. representative, Pete
Baumgaertner, Jeff Bebee,
John Vlahoplus, and John But-
tarazzi all received enough
votes to make the run-off elec-
tion. Vlahoplus received 105
votes, Baumgaertner took 58,
Buttarazzi received 53 votes,
Bebee took 49, and Craig Ar-
mantrout Conn, who did not
make the run-off had 35 votes.

In the race for president of
the Class of 1983, Eric Nelson
and Chris Stokes received 78
and 61 votes respectively to
make the run-off election. Mike
Drinkwater received 30 votes.

The election for vice-presi-
dent-Arts for the senior class
also produced a run-off. Jim
Baldwin received 14 votes and
Ralph Paris took 11 to make it
to Thursday’s election. Ty
Lawson, who did not make the
cut, received 5 votes.

Jack Sharman received 12
votes and Jay Windsor got 17 to
get their chances in the run-off
election for senior vice-presi-
dent-Commerce. Brad Vaughan
missed the run-off by one vote.
He received 11 votes.

In the Class of 1984 elections,
four students received enough
votes in the race for E.C.
Representative to campaign for
the Thursday vote.

Ted McQuiston received 52
votes, Scott Mason received 36
votes, barely edging Peter Col-
lins, who received 35 votes, and

Jack O’Brien took 26 votes.
“These candidates will be in the

run-off election.
Leighton Stradtman and John

McCants both received 24 votes
in their E.C. candidacy, fol-
lowed by Markham Pyle with
17, Jeff Wells with 15, and
Emory Edwards with eight’
votes.

In the election for president of
the junior class, Bob Jenevein
took 56 votes and Parker
Schenecker took 43 votes to
become eligible for the run-off
vote. Leonard Howard received
23 votes.

The race for junior class vice-
president was very tight, and
placed two candidates in the
run-off election. Ben St. Clair
edged out Charlie Alcorn 49
votes to 45, but both are cand-
idates in Thursday’s election.
Jet Taylor received 27 votes.

The sophomore class elec-
tions were also very tight. In the
E.C. Representative election,
Darby Brower received 166
votes, Dave Johnson received
138 votes, Cole Dawson received
121 votes, and Roger Day took
31 votes. Each of the above
candidates will be on the ballot
in the run-off election. George
Kinkead took 27 votes, but dia
not make the run-off.

The election for President of
next year’s sophomores pro-
duced two run-off candidates.
Kevin Kelley received 123
votes, and Sam Dalton received
71 votes to make Thursday’s
election. Charles Davidson, who
was defeated, received 60 votes.

The race for sophomore class
vice-president cut the field from
five candidates to two. Robert
Tomaso and Bill Brown re-
ceived 96 and 57 votes respec-
tively to make the run-off. They
defeated Gordon Ogden (45
votes), Mare Monyek (42
votes), and Tom Pearce (14
votes).

The races for the three vice-
president positions in the senior

class ran into a few problems as
the vote was counted. Accord-
ing to E.C. secretary Bennett
Ross, about 25 ballots were
thrown out because students
circled more than one cand-
idate.

Sophomore representative
Ben Hale pointed out that the
ballots were disqualified after
students chose to pick can-
didates for each vice-presi-
dency beacuse of confusion over
the rules. Voters were allowed
to vote only for the candidates
in the area of their majors. Hale
added that the sign explaining
this fact was not in clear view,
and there was no explanation on
the ballot. Students double ma-
joring in two of the areas who
wished to cast two votes also

caused confusion. Double ma- °

jors may vote for only one can-
didate.

Second-year law _ represen-
tative Morgan Griffith showed
his concern over the election
saying the E.C. had to do
something about the problem of
confusion in this election.
“More votes were disqualified
in this election than any one
candidate _ received,’’ he
stressed.

At this point in the delibera-
tion, the committee seemed
ready to call for a new election,
but no one made the motion. In-
stead, the E.C. opted to run a re-
count of all the ballots in the
senior vice-president race, with
all double votes to be thrown
out.

In other action, the Executive
Committee heard reports from
the W&L Film Society, Ariel,
the Publications Board, the In-
ternational Club, and the E.C.
moved to freeze all funds to the
Calyx until its staff contacted
the E.C. The Calyx was to be
represented at the meeting, but
none of the staff showed up.

Film Society President
Russell Clarke reported that the
Polish film, ‘‘“Man of Marble,”’

a “‘pitch’’ for contributions at
the beginning of the film to help

nounced the film for this week,
“92 in the Shade,”’ which will be
shown Friday and Saturday.

prose on Wednesday, March 24,

Students ina Washington and
Lee University journalism class
had a chance to test their skills
in television production on a
major scale last week when
Cable Channel Nine, W&L’s
student-operated television sta-
tion, presented a live telecast of
the NCAA Division III Swim-
ming and Diving Champion-
ships.

The three-day NCAA event,
which involved more than 375
competitors from 75 different
Division III colleges and univer-
sities, was held in Washington
and Lee’s Twombly Pool.

Cable Channel Nine, which
ordinarily provides three hours
of daily programming, carried
18 hours of live coverage during
the meet and produced a nightly
highlights program.

“This event provided in-
valuable experience for our
students,’’ said Robert J. de
Maria, assistant professor of
journalism at Washington and

For the past month, the
Letitia Pate Evans Dining Hall
was in violation of a Lexington
fire code. The dining hall has
six exits, and of these exits, only
three are marked.

Each night between 6:30 p.m.
and 6:45 p.m., four of these ex-
its were locked even though
sometimes 40 or 50 students
were still eating. In itself, this is
neither a safety hazard nor a
violation.

According to Leonard Reiss,
City Building Inspector for.the
City of Lexington, ‘Even forty
or fifty people would be no pro-
blem. Just two of those doors
could handle 300 people.”

The violation was that of the
four doors that were locked, two
were marked as exits. Reiss
stated that “as long as the
building is occupied — even if
it’s just one person — you can’t
lock a marked exit.”

Reiss added that the dining
hall ‘‘wouldn’t have a smoke
problem because of the high
ceilings. There is almost no
chance that a flash fire could
catch anybody.”

Lee. “Covering an event of this
size created situations that
caused the students to display a
lot of originality in their ap-
proach.

“In addition to normal Cable
Channel Nine staff members,
students in Journalism 232
(Television Production) were
involved in the overall produc-
tion.”

W&L’s Cable Channel Nine is
seen on the Lexington cable

system. In addition, a closed.

circuit system was created
within the university’s Warner
Center, allowing competitors to
watch the proceedings on a big
screen television several floors
above the Twombly Pool.

“Having the telecast
available helped us relieve the
congestion around the pool with
the enormous number of com-
petitors we had,” said W&L
swimming coach Page Remil-
lard.

exit sign is covered or a promi-
nent sign is placed on the door
warning that it is locked.

When Jerry Darrell, director
of university dining and food
services was told of the matter,
he immediately said he would
take care of it. This was in keep-
ing with Reiss’s comment that

ESPN, a national cable station
specializing in sports program-
ming, and WVPT, the public
television station in Harrison-
burg, Va., had originally ex-
pressed interest in telecasting

the swimming event.
“When both of those
possibilities failed to

materialize, we decided to
tackle it,” said de Maria. ‘‘It re-
quired a lot of technical exper-
tise in adition to a lot of
hours.”

Tom Tinsley, director of
technical services at W&L,
served as technical supervisor
for the telecast.

Bill Parks, a senior at W&L,
was the executive producer

senior, was the crew chief.

Although the university has
since complied with the regula-
tion, Reiss is drafting a follow-
up letter officially notifying the
university of the violation. A

office.

Rush Study Favored

by Scott Mason

Newly-elected  Inter-
fraternity Council Vice Presi-
dent Steve Jones said that he
favors further study into a
delayed Rush system as part of
his recently acquired duties.

Jones said that it is “very im-
portant to look into the delayed
Rush matter further.” Jones
said that he feels the Rush
system is fine as is, although a
lengthy study into possible
changes of the system may
result in previously overlooked
benefits.

Swimmers Finish 9th; Lax Drubs N.C. St.

400-Free Relayers,
Bernot Lead W&L

by Andrew P. Hoppes

Washington and Lee’s 400-yard freestyle relay
team kicked to a fourth-place finish to help the
Generals earn a ninth-place team finish in last
weekend’s NCAA Division III Swimming and Div-
ing Championships in Lexington.

The ninth-place finish, the highest for the
Generals since another ninth in 1977, exceeded the
pre-tournament predictions of Coach Page
Remillard and his staff. W&L compiled 51 points,
one more than 10th-place Allegheny.

Individually, senior Mike Bernot placed second
in both the 50-yard freestyle and 100-yard freestyle
races to add two more All-American honors to his
previous five. Bernot missed another All-
American honor by finishing 13th in the 200-yard
freestyle. The top 12 finishers earn All-American
Honors.

Preventing Bernot from joining John Hudson as
W&L’s only champion in an NCAA swimming
event was William Patterson College’s Joseph
Gentile. Gentile, whose qualifying time in the 50-

yard freestyle was the fourth-fastest in the entire —

nation, swam to victories in the 50, 100, and 200-
yard freestyles.

In the 100-yard freestyle preliminaries, Bernot
swam a 45.96 to set a new Division III record. That
record lasted about a minute until Gentile swam a
45.75 in the next heat.

A second W&L swimmer, junior Rob Crawford,
notched two All-American spots. Crawford fin-
ished 11th in the 100-yard breaststroke and 12th in

first All-American honors.

W&L’s biggest heroes though were the swim-
mers on the 400-yard freestyle team, who ac-
counted for 22 of W&L’s 51 points.

'Good Ball Control
Key i

in 13-10 Win

by John Harrison

Take away the opposition’s potent offense by
reducing its fast break opportunities. This
strategy has been the same in all the games the
Washington and Lee lacrosse team has played to
date and, judging from the strong schedule that
remains, it could stay that way for the rest of the
season.

But as long as that strategy continues to work,
nobody associated with the team is likely to argue
with it.

Last week the Generals were able to slow down
Navy mainly by controlling the ball and looking
for the good shot. In last Saturday’s 13-10 victory
over North Carolina State, W&L carried out its
plan by keeping the Wolfpack tied up in its own
end when it tried to clear the ball.

The win improved the Generals’ record to 3-1
(prior to yesterday’s game at Delaware). Rob
Staugaitis led W&L with three goals and two
assists, while Lee Heimert contributed three more
goals, including two in the fourth quarter.

Mike Schuler also had three points on a goal and
two assists. W&L goaltender Ware Palmer made
seven saves, the most important coming on a shot
from point blank distance in the closing minutes.

Head coach Jack Emmer said that one factor in
the victory was W&L’s ability to ‘‘ride’’ State. This
involves stealing a clearing pass from the opposi-
tion and knocking the ball loose from the man try-
ing to make the clear.

‘“‘We’re trying to be more aggressive, especially
on defense, than we were last year,’’ noted tri-
captain Mike Schuler. Schuler cited the play of
Newton Kendrick and Mike Pressler as two of the
reasons for the improvement on defense.

Another key was the Generals’ ability to control
faceoffs in spite of the loss of regular midfielder
John Tunney to an injury. Said Emmer, “Rich

Despite Heat, Humidity, NCAA Meet A Success

ee ee

 

by G. Bruce Potter

The NCAA Division III Swim-

‘ ming and Diving Champion-

«ships last weekend. at

Washington and Lee were an

unqualified success, and much

of the credit must go to Page
Remillard.

As well as serving as meet
director, Remillard coached the
W&L team to a ninth place
finish, their best since 1977.
Here are some brief postscripts
to the event:

The NCAA meet was the com-
puter timing system. Who needs
a gun to start a race when you
can use a beep? Of course, that
little beep created great
frustration in the finals of the
1650-yard freestyle event on
Saturday evening as the clock

malfunctioned to cause a 25-
minute delay.

The NCAA meet was the heat
and humidity. Earlier in the
season, Remillard, sitting in the
even-then unpleasant heat of a
nearly-empty pool gallery, said,
‘Can you imagine what the heat
will be like in March when 500
people are up here?” He
couldn’t have come closer to the
truth as the pool gallery was
more like a sauna and pro-
grams were most popularly
used as fans.

The NCAA meet was Doug
Jones and Joseph Gentile.
Jones led Claremont-Mudd to a
fourth-place finish by winning
the 500-yard freestyle, the 100-
yard backstroke and the 200-
yard backstroke and setting na-

tional records in all three. And

he doesn’t even shave his head.
Gentile scored all of William

Patterson’s 48 points by captur-

ing the 50-, 100-, and 200-yard
freestyle races. Gentile
qualified for the 1980 Olympics,
so W&L swimmer Mike Bernot
shouldn’t be too upset at losing
to him by a fraction of a second
in the 50- and 100-yard events.

The NCAA meet was
Remillard himself. Dressed un-
characteristically in a jacket
and tie, the third-year coach
seemed to be all over the place.

final, Remillard was in true
form throughout the weekend.
The NCAA meet was the fans.
They came from all over the
country in groups representing
their team, and the largest con-
tingent seemed to support the
eventual national champion,
Kenyon College of Ohio. But
there were also the yellow-
shirted Allegheny fans and the
girlfriends of nearly every
swimmer present. All the fans
were extremely knowledgeable
and obviously had plenty of ex-
perience at this type of thing, be
it a recreational, high school or
college meet. They came armed
with programs, pencils, pens,
sophisticated stopwatches and
heat sheets, (nothing to do with
the temperature but actually a
listing of swimmers omen

   
       

in a specific event and room to
enter their times).

And, of course, the NCAA
meet was the swimmers. Their
aquatic performances were
quite incredible in themselves,
but their out-of-water actions
typified the spirit of a Division
III event. These included
Allegheny College swimmers
spelling out their school name
along the edge of the pool, the
State University of New York
swimmer leading cheers from
atop the 3-meter diving board,
Kenyon’s David Dininny and
Allegheny’s Daniel Stewart ex-
changing a few words of en-
couragement prior to the 200-
yard individual medley final,
and the applause that every
winner received, especially if
= had set a record.

pick up an 8-6 win in their first ODAC game of the season.

Baseball Downs VMI

by Andrew P. Hoppes

Washington and Lee’s
baseball team tallied two more
wins recently, including a vic-
tory over V.M.I., to raise its
record to 4-2.

“‘We showed a lot of poise and
confidence,” noted Coach Jim
Murdock in reference to the 7-5
win over Virginia Military.
Murdock also observed that it
was W&L’s first victory over
V.M.I. in several years.

V.M.I. jumped out to a 4-1
lead off eventual winning pit-
cher Dave Randall, but the
Generals. responded with five
runs in the fifth. Four walks, a
sacrifice fly by Mike Walsh, and
one of Chris Cavalline’s three
hits highlighted the inning.

On Friday, the Generals
played poorly in dropping a 9-2
decision to Longwood. .

‘“‘We didn’t play up to our ex-
pectations and we were a little
sloppy in the field,’ explained
Murdock.

A Saturday doubleheader
with Emory and Henry was
rained out. The games were
supposed to be W&L’s first
league contests.

W&L finally opened the
league schedule with an 8-6 win
over Bridgewater at home
Tuesday. Dave Randall picked
up the win to raise his record to
30 and Bill White earned a
save.

Craig Cannon and Wes
Yonge, numbers one and two on
the team, respectively, were on
the wrong side of luck Tuesday
as they both lost their singles
and doubles matches. Cannon
dropped an 8-6 tiebreaker to
lose 7-6,6-4, and Yonge suffered
a 4-6,6-3,3-6 defeat. The doubles
team of Cannon and Charlie
Kalocsay lost 4-6,4-6, and
Yonge-Jim Irwin followed suit,
3-6,6-3,1-6.

Cannon shook his head after
losing his singles match and
said, ‘I missed so many easy
shots.”’ His singles opponent,
Mike Yarborough of
Greensboro, took a five second
“Slow motion” service delivery
before booming his serve at
Cannon.

“It (the serve) bothered me a
lot,’’ said Cannon, who was also
frustrated with his opponent’s
mixture of ‘pushing’ (soft
shots) and “kills” during the
match.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Cops And/Or Robbers

So the Lexington Police Department has a few of-
ficers who decided to earn a little extra money while
on the job. Does it really surprise anyone that we have
a few policemen who decided to work against, and not
with, the law?

But before we go blaming the L.P.D. for all of this
town’s problems, let’s look at what this university has
done to protect its students. We have janitors who
spend their time lounging around the dorms watching
‘Love Boat” reruns or handing out betting cards. We
have a group of night watchmen who sit in the
warmth of the Student Center watching ‘‘Quincy” and
“Vegas” reruns. These people do their jobs, but
they’re usually two steps behind every crime on cam-

 

 

 

pus.

Meanwhile, cars parked outside the Student Center
suffer stolen antenna, license plates, batteries,
radios, etc. In the freshmen dorms, students learn at
an early stage to keep their doors locked. In the
fraternities, students come back from break with the
dread of not knowing if the house remained
unpenetrated.

The time has come for this university to give its
students some adequate protection. The school should
hire some trained guards, not the group of handymen
it has now. When we no longer can trust our fellow
man, we have lost our honor. And without honor and
: honor system, this school does not have much to of-

er.

The L.P.D. can no longer be trusted and our univer-
sity’s security force is not adequate. If the university
wants its students to enjoy Lexington, it should
student that Lexington does not get the best of the

student

week in a_ three-day

Also approved was a second

‘which clarifies the Executive

how the votes went or what the

several times*to ammend the

mittee under President Eric

(continued from page 1)
President Leonid Brezhnev for
a freeze of medium-ranged
nuclear weapons in Europe is
misleading. While he supports
reductions of strategic theater
nuclear weapons, he said, the
freeze proposed by Brezhnev
would give a decided edge to the
Soviets.

The former president found
fault with one aspect of the ad-
ministration’s response to
events in Poland.

“It was a mistake to have our
government not force Poland
into default,’ he said. “It’s a

harsh judgement, but I think
you can agree —by paying their
debt, we’re sponsoring martial
law in Poland.”

Ford lambasted Democrats
in Congress — a favorite oc-
cupation —saying they keep ad-
ding to a budget deficit they
themselves scream about day
in and day out now. He also
reveled in reciting unemploy-
ment, inflation and prime rate
figures at the time he left office
in 1977 — ‘and turned the wheel
over to Jimmy Carter, whose
mistakes he suggested we are
dearly paying for right now.

Oscar time has rolled around

are interested in movies have
made my predictions as to who
or what will capture academy
awards on Monday. Included in
this article are my predictions
as well as my _ personal
favorites.

Best Actor: Nominated are
Henry Fonda for On Golden
Pond, Warren Beatty for Reds,
Dudley Moore for Arthur, Paul
Newman for Absence of Malice,
and Burt Lancaster for Atlantic
City. My personal favorite here
is also who I think will get the
Oscar this year: Henry Fonda.
Fonda’s performance as a man
obsessed with dying was ex-
cellent. He’ll capture the sen-
timental vote as well, for if he
wins, it will be his first Oscar
for a performance.

Best Actress: Diane Keaton
for Reds, Kathryn Hepburn for
On Golden Pond, Marsha
Mason, for Only When I Laugh,
Susan Sarandon for Atlantic Ci-
ty, and Meryl Streep for The
French Lieutenant’s Woman.
The choice here will be between
sentimental favorite Hepburn,
popular favorite Keaton, and
the exact performance of
Streep. I pick Hepburn, but
barely.

Supporting Actor:
Nicholson for Reds, James Coco
for Only When I Laugh, Sir John
Gielgud for Arthur, Ian Holm
for Chariots of Fire, and
Howard Rolling for Ragtime.
My personal favorite is Sir John
Gielgud for his hilarious role as
the butler in Arthur. However,
he’ll have stiff competition
from Nicholson for his brilliant
characterization of Eugene

Jack °

O’Neill in Reds. Still a toss-up.

Supporting Actress: Maureen
Stapleton for Reds, Melinda
Dillon for Absence of Malice,
Joan Hackett for Only When I
Laugh, Elizabeth McGovern for
Ragtime, and Jane Fonda for
On Golden Pond. While
Stapleton was tremendous as
Emma Goldman in Reds, her
part was too small to compare
to that of Elizabeth McGovern.
McGovern will win.

Best Picture: Reds, On
Golden Pond, Atlantic City,
Raiders of the Lost Ark,

Chariots of Fire. This is the
toughest of all categories for
me. It is hard to decide whether
the voters will opt for the thrill-
ing escapism of Raiders, the
sentimentality of On Golden
Pond, the simplicity of Chariots
of Fire, or the grandeur of

‘92 In The Shade’ At Lewis

by Patrick Hinely

The Washington and Lee Film Society’s seventh
presentation for the season will be Thomas
McGuane’s comedy 92 in the Shade (USA, 1975: 93
minutes). Screenings will be held on Friday and
Saturday, March 26 and 27, at 8:00 p.m. in
classroom ‘‘A’’ of Lewis Hall, the W&L Law
School. Admission is free.

McGuane is best known as a novelist and screen-
writer, and this film is unique in presenting him in
both of these lights, as well as being his sole direc-
torial credit to date. His other novels have includ-
ed The Sporting Club (1969), The Bushwhacked
Piano, Panama (1978), and the recently published
An Outside Chance. McGuane’s screenwriting
credits include Rancho Deluxe (1975), directed by
Frank Perry, and The Missouri Breaks (1976),
directed by Arthur Penn.

92 in the Shade is a contemporary epic of the
peculiarly American competition ethic of the
smal] businessman, played out by a bizarre trio of
freelance fishing guides in Key West, Florida.
Like the city itself, the story straddles that line
unique to the tropics, between impoverished lux-
ury and circumstantial madness.

Skelton, played by Peter Fonda, is the local boy
come home from a typically 60’s psychedelic col-
lege experience with nothing in particular on his
mind except how to deal graciously with a family
which includes the local power broker and several
others who are at most partially sane. He decides
to take up guiding, much to the chagrin of Carter,
played by Harry Dean Stanton, and Nichol Dance,
masterfully characterized by Warren Oates, both
of whom are firmly ensconced in the status quo.
Carter’s subtle scheming drives Dance to acts of

 

redneck madness. Skelton, more laid back, even-
tually turns to fighting fire with fire as he tunes in
to the post-acid surreality of the Key West en-
vironment.

The screenplay holds true to the novel up to the
last moment, at which point optimism overtakes
cynicism, leading one to wonder what happened in
McGuane’s own life between publication of the
novel in 1973 and direction of the movie in 1975. In
critical terms, McGuane’s career has been
somewhat speckled, with current opinion being
that he peaked with the writing of 92 in the Shade.
The film’s commercial debut was less than spec-
tacular, but that seems to have been due more to
the caprices of corporate management than to the
quality of the film itself.

Vincent Canby, in The New York Times,
described the film as being “full of odd,
headstrong, seemingly disconnected moments
that only a novelist would dare, and it’s a field day
for the actors.’’ Besides Oates, Fonda, and Stan-
ton, the cast includes Burgess Meredith as
Skelton’s-eccentric grandfather, Margot Kidder
as Miranda, Skelton’s schoolteacher girlfriend,
and William Hickey as Skelton’s voluntarily in-
sane father.

On April 30 and May 1, the Film Society will
show Carlos Saura’s Cria (Spain, 1977: 115
minutes), a movie from the new Spain, since
Franco. The W&L Film Society brings to Lex-
ington recent films of quality which commercial
outlets choose to ignore, at least on the local scene.
It is funded in part by the student body, and in part
by private contributors. Contributions are very
much appreciated.

Reds. The current trend in past
years would lead me to pick On
Golden Pond, which is much in
the style of Kramer and
Ordinary People.
Reds might just win out, but 1
doubt it.

In other areas, I pick Beatty

Chariots of Fire for Original

Also, while my _ personal
favorite is For Your Eyes Only,
Endless Love will win Best

Best Make-up Honors.

“Kiehne filled in very well, and
once we got the ball, we held it
well.”

With the. score tied at two
after the first quarter, junior
Bob Carpenter put W&L ahead
by using a pick, sliding to his
right and putting a shot over the
shoulder of starting goalie Tom
Wagner at 13:08 of the second
quarter.

After State tied it again with a
screen shot that bounced by
Ware Palmer, the Generals
took the lead for good on two
consecutive goals by Staugaitis.
On the second one, Staugaitis
took the ball at midfield, rushed
down the left side uncontested
and beat Wagner on the long
side with a bouncer.

W&L almost turned the game
into a rout by taking an 8-4 lead
with 11 minutes to go in the
third quarter. John Buttarazzi
converted a rebound after the
initial shot by Lee Heimert.
John Doub then made it 7-4
when he connected on a crisp
pass from Staugaitis.

At that point, Wagner was
replaced with sophomore Dave
Kennan. Keenan was quickly

beaten by Jeff Mason who took
Mike Lewers’ pass from behind
the goal and slammed it in.

But by the end of the quarter
the Wolfpack had tied it at nine.
The last two scores came with
less than half a minute to go.

After Scott Nelson made it
nine to eight, Kevin Sullivan
notched his third goal of the day
when he beat Palmer with a
backhander, even though he
was facing away from the goal
and had two defensemen cover-
ing him.

John Sancilio’s tenth goal of
the season, a low shot from
eight yards out, put W&L ahead
for good. With 9:52 left,
Staugaitis faked out Keenan to
make the margin 11-9. The
Generals then used up the clock
when State was called for two
straight penalties.

Two goals by Keimert put the
game out of question. After Tim
Nelson made it 13-10 with five
minutes remaining, State was
whistled for another penalty,
The loss dropped the Wolfpack
to 2-2.

W&L’s last game before ex-
ams will be this Saturday at 2
p.m. on Wilson Field against
Towson State.

broke the school record.

Sophomore Tim Rock, who
earned an All-American honor
for W&L last year, did not fare
as well this year. Rock missed
earning All-American honors
when he finished 13th in the
1650-yard freestyle.

Rock .also competed in the
500-yard freestyle, finishing
26th.

Sophomore Rand McClain

in the event with a time of 22.41
in the preliminary.

W&L also had entries in the
400-yard medley and 800-yard
