Local Man Found Guilty
In Feb. Pika Incident

by Patrick Jordan

_ A Natural Bridge man was
convicted in Lexington General
District Court Tuesday of
trespassing and carrying a con-
_cealed weapon last February at
the PiKappa Alpha fraternity.

' Edison Diamond, 39, of Route
One, Natural Bridge, was fined
$150 and given a suspended
sentence in connection with two
separate incidents at the frater-
nity during Fancy Dress week-
end parties.

Judge Joseph E. Hess
dismissed a third charge
against Diamond for ‘carrying
a loaded firearm within the ci-
jty.””

According. to Brad Vaughan,
a member of the PiKA house,
Diamond had entered the
fraternity during a party on
Feb. 28 and was trying to get
some of the girls to go outside
with him.

Vaughan said several of the

 

fraternity brothers became
upset and asked him and)
another fraternity member to
tell Diamond to leave.

“‘We escorted him outside and

 

told him it was a private party
and that he should leave,” |
Vaughan said. “He became |
somewhat upset at that point.
and he showed Andy Gries-
baum, the house president, and
me his handgun.”’

Vaughan’ said Diamond
returned to the fraternity early
on March 1 after being released
on bail and demanded to know
who had called the police the
day before.

Vaughan said Diamond then
started shoving some of the
house’s brothers and the police
were summoned again.

According to Lexington
Police Officer Wayne
Rhodenizer, Diamond was ar-
rested a second time and charg-
ed with trespassing.

Executive Committee Rescinds

Pub Board At-Large Members

By Todd Smith

Tom Booher, at his second
E.C. meeting as Freshman Law
Representative, presented a
subcommittee report on the
problems of the constitution on
Monday night.

The Executive Committee
also heard reports from the
Cold Check Committee and the

Ring-tum Phi, and from
representatives studying the
honor system.

A subcommittee of newly
elected Booher and Cole
Dawson ‘85, as well as
Secretary Bennett Ross,
presented nine recommenda-
tions for clarifying the constitu-
tion. President Eric Myers
commended them for ‘their
work.

Some of the recommenda-
tiens dealt with the recently
passed constitutional amend-
ments, and compliance with
them as well as with parts of the

Polo Wins Southern League Tourney

by G. Bruce Potter

The Washington and Lee
water polo team captured their
first Southern League Cham-
pionship by downing the
University of Richmond for the
second time in as many days,
11-5, in the final of the four
team, double-elimination event
last weekend at Cy Twombly
pool.

Only converting on two of
eight six-on-five (power play)
opportunities in the first half,
the Generals were down 4-2 at
halftime. ‘On a power play, if

_you’re a little too quick or a lit-

tle too eager, you miss the
goal,’’ explained sophomore
Rand McClain.

However, head coach Page
Remillard then stepped in. Mc-
Clain described his halftime
tongue lashing as a ‘‘motivation
speech.”’

Whatever he said must have
worked, because the Generals
were a new team in the second
half. They turned the ball over

‘on their first possession, but a

Richmond shot was off the
mark. On their ensuing posses-

sion, W&L took advantage of a
six-on-five situation and worked
the ball around to Ken
Johnstone to the right of the
goal. Johnstone, a lefty, easily
fired a bullet past the Richmond
goalie, and the lead was cut to
one.

Following another Richmond
penalty a minute later, All-
American Don Smith tapped in
a lob pass from co-captain Tim
Rock to knot the score at four.
Junior Erik Peterson then took
a pass from Johnstone and drill-
ed it home to give the Generals
the lead for good.

Washington and Lee, now
29-4, killed two penalties in the
next minute-and-a-half, and
when Rock, with 1:33 left in the
quarter, made a steal at mid-
pool, swam into a one-on-one
situation with the Richmond

constitution that had not been
amended.

‘‘We decided that we are go-
ing to have to follow the
balloting,’ said Booher for the
subcommittee, in reference to

’ lack of votes for an amendment

that would add two members at
large, appointed by the Ex-
ecutive Committee, on the
Publications Board.

A Ring-tum Phi editorial de-
nounced that amendment and
another that would clearly
subordinate the Publications
Board to the Committee. Ross
said at the meetings that the
editorial contributed to the lack
of a majority on other amend-
ments as well.

Ken Lang, ’82 Rep., spoke
against the rescinding of the
two members at large now serv-
ing as liasons to the Pub Board.
Lang recommended the E.C.
acknowledge ‘‘that we
overstepped our boundaries and-
that (future E.C.s) shouldn’t
appoint members at large.”’

He said that the present
members should be retzuined

because they had waited a long
time on appointment interview
night and had put a lot into the
job already.

“We're not dealing with a
piece of paper, we’re dealing
with two people.”’

Ben Hale, ’84 Rep., agreed
that the two appointees should
be retained. He noted that they
were not voting members and
their attendance at Pub Board
meetings was perfectly legiti-
mate.

Myers sided with Booher and
others who argued that to keep
the two in office would be to con-
tradict the mandate of the stu-
dent body.

To retain them would be a

“massive aberration,’’ said
Myers.

Usually reserved, Frank
Smith, °83 Rep., inveighed

against the retention of the two,
“they are no longer legitimate
because the vote has been no.”’
With an 8-4 vote, the E.C. ac-
cepted a motion to rescind Ed-
ward Gonsalves and Rob Willis

Election Night 1981:

Organized Confusion

by Chris Peacock and
Ben Jarratt
To most viewers and

listeners, broadcasts of election
coverage generally appear
relatively slick. But what goes
on when the lights are killed and
the reporters switch back to the
stations is sometimes little
more than organized confusion.

On election night 1981 two stu-
dent reporters for WLUR and
Cable Nine — Ben Jarratt and
Chris Peacock — found them-
selves to be part of that confu-
sion, and probably much less
organized.

It all began with our arrival
at the John Marshall Hotel in
Richmond, and the site of the
state Democratic Party’s vic-
tory celebration. We arrived
around 6 p.m. It appeared the
rest of the media-types had
been setting up since that morn-
ing; of course few of them had
to attend classes that day.

Our job was to send back
semi-regular reports to Reid
Hall. We had been instructed to
contact a member of guber-
natorial candidate (now
Governor-elect) Chuck Robb’s
staff, and she was to help us set
up. She was nowhere to be
found. In fact, it took over fif-
teen minutes to locate anyone
who had ever heard of the girl.

   
  

We never found her, but we
were befriended by a Roanoke
television reporter Eugenia
Halsey. She knew our contact,
but could not find her, either.
Eugenia did introduce us to
the only Democratic official in
sight. He was a state legislator
who appeared to have been

support of the Democratic Par-
ty that night — the proceeds
from the $2.25-a-drink bar went
into the Democratic coffers. He
was not a great deal of help.

We were told we would have a
spot reserved for us at one of
the media tables. ‘‘Spot’’ was
right. Awaiting us was a 3-x-5

Entertainment
Film Series In Review

by Carren O. Kaston

The Washington and Lee
Japanese Film Series conclud-
ed this Monday after presenting
five movies made available to
the school by the Japan Founda-
tion. The movies were Kon
Ichikawa’s The Heart (1955),
Yasujiro Shimazu’s Okoto and
Sasuke (1935), Mikio Naruse’s
Sound of the Mountain (1954),
Kon Ichikawa’s Conflagration
(1958), and Hiroshi
Teshigahara’s Woman in the
Dunes (1964). Attendance at the
showings averaged 50-90 peo-
ple. Audiences for the movies
shown later in the series were
larger, apparently because of
accumulated publicity and in-
creased awareness. Most of the
showings took place in the Law
School, which generously
donated the use of the room and
the equipment.

These films, which were spon-
sored by the university’s East
Asian Studies Program, were
shown in conjunction with
“Japanese Literature in
Translation,” a W&L course
which is taught in alternate

years. Professor Minor Rogers
of the Religion department, who
teaches the course with Pro-
fessor John Evans of the
English department, an-
ticipates having films again
when the course is offered in the
fall of 1983, although the selec-
tion may differ. Professor
Rogers hopes to be able to get
some films which are not adap-
tations of major modern
Japanese novels, but which
simply show contemporary
Japanese life. One of the goals
of the series, as stipulated by
the Japan Foundation, is to pro-
mote intellectual and cultural
understanding of Japan world-
wide.

Audiences at the films varied
from Washington and Lee facul-
ty and students, to townspeople,
to VMI cadets. Markham Pyle,
a W&L sophomore, believes
that the increasing importance
of the Far East to Western
businesses and_ industries,
especially the oil industry,
makes it essential that
Washington and Lee students
familiarize themselves with

emphasize the connections be-
tween marine ecology and
ocean energy resources, inter-
national law, world politics, and
corporate affairs.

During his visit, Mr. Hon will
meet with classes in Phi-
losophy, Sociology, and
Politics, and he has also ex-
pressed interest in classes in
Art and Religion. The breadth
of his interests suggests a
perspective seasoned in both
the arts and sciences.

Mr. Hon’s first love is
ecology, the study of the inter-
relationship of organisms and

Oriental attitudes and culture.
He sees the series as logical and
even necessary viewing for
many students here who would
not otherwise plan to attend.
Mr. Pyle, the former Phi
Entertainment Editor,
helped to promote the series by
giving space to weekly reviews
of the movies. He sees the up-
coming exhibit of Japanese and
Chinese Decorative Arts in du-
Pont Gallery from November 17
to December 17 as a similar op-
portunity for W&L_ students,
headed for business, to
familiarize themselves with the
East.

Professor David Bausum in
the Math department was
especially struck with the
Japanese interiors shown in the
film, the compact and highly
functional way in_ which,
through sliding doors, a
minimum of furniture, and split
levels, space is apportioned in
the Japanese house. Another of
the series’ attractions for him
was the emphasis on the family,
even when, as in many cases,

their environments. This led
him into an interdisciplinary in-
terest in the interconnectedness
of the various forces that shape
human life and consciousness.
Mr. Hon points out that a
typical education divides the
learning experience among
several disciplines and depart-
ments, which are regarded as
more or less distinct. The result
is that the kind of education now
favored rarely culminates in
the spirit of interdisciplinary in-
quiry which is its professed
goal.

Film Notes

Apocalpse Now (1979) Francis Ford Coppola’s indulgent spec-
tacle finds its plot in Joseph Conrad’s ‘‘Heart of Darkness” and
takes place during the war in Vietnam. It is embellished with amaz-
ing special effects, excellent photography and compelling perfor-
mances by Martin Sheen and Robert Duvall. The film loses ground
quickly at about midpoint, and its worse scenes occur near the end
when Sheen finally discovers his prey, Col. Marlon Brando, who is
living in decadence and controlling a community of rather stunned-
looking Cambodians. If these natives are Buddhists then it would be
understandable why they worship the obese, skin headed Brando;
the ending pulls down the rest of the film with more than a few:
credulity problems. A flawed masterpiece. Shown by the SAB: Fri-
day, Saturday, Sunday; at7 and 9:45 p.m. ; tickets are $1.

Stagecoach (1939) The classic John Ford western firmly
established John Wayne as a major star. Dudley Nichol wrote the
screenplay; portions of the film were shot in Monument Valley, a
favorite Ford locale. Not his finest western, but one of his most

Trio Entertains

by Andrew Trotter

Three young American
women, comprising the St. Ger-
main Trio, presented a lively,
refined concert to a receptive
audience last Tuesday night in
Lee Chapel.

The New York-based group,
whose name _ indicates the
members’ affinity toward
Paris, where each has lived,
studied and practiced, gave a
program highlighting several
stages in 18th century chamber
music, with one 20th century
piece.

Trios in the realm of classical
music usually consist of violin,
cello and piano, or three str-
ings. The St. Germain Trio
replaces the violin with a flute.
It has the advantage of being a
novel combination but also the
' considerable disadvantage of a
very limited repertory from
which to draw.

Pauline Lederer, the pianist,
said in a conversation before
the concert that the group sup-
pliments the repertory by
transcribing pieces to suit its in-
strumentation, or substitutes
the flute for the violin, as in the
opening work, W.A. Mozart's
‘Trio inC Major,”’ K. 548.

The Mozart piece, written in
1788, is a fine classical exam-
ple: two bright Allegros
separated by a stately Andante
cantablile, with delicate  or-
naments from the French
rococo style. The cellist, Ettie
Minor, played with smooth
phrasing and Lederer mastered
the piano’s. formidable
technical demands. But
although Deborah Nathan, the
flutist, played with bright tone
and dynamic power, the flute
seemed to lack the ‘‘bite’’ of the
violin, and its ability to blend in-

to a delicate balance with the
other voices.

In the “Trio for Flute, ‘Cello
and Piano,” by Carl Maria von
Weber, however, a fine in-
terplay between the voices was
achieved. This piece is neo-
Classical; the piano’s subtle
shifts between dark and light
moods, subtly executed by
Lederer, foreshadow the
Romantic period. The third
movement, entitled ‘‘Shep-
herd’s Lament,’’ features a
beautiful, slow melody,
developed in turn by the flute,
the piano, and the cello. The
warmth of tone from Minor’s
cello was especially appealing.

_The third work, from the ear-
ly 1700’s, was Jean Marie
Leclair’s ‘‘Sonate a Trois in D
Major.’’ The pattern of
movements is typical of the
Italian Baroque (slow-fast-
slow-fast), and, like the Mozart
trio, it shows the French in-
fluence of ornamentation.

The program. finished with
“Trio for Flute, ‘Cello . and
Piano,”’ by Bochuslav Martinu,
a Czech who emigrated to the
United States in 1941. Martinu
writes in a modern idiom, but
with simplicity and lyricism.
The Trio is a fresh mixture of
bitonality and syncopated
rhythms, with several
humorous deceptions and a sur-
prise finish. In the Poco
allegretto, each instrument
takes an independent course,
only to rejoin the others, from
time to time, in a rich melange.
In this difficult piece, the per-
formers’ phrasing and unity
seemed particularly fine.

The attractive and vivacious
trio treated an appreciative au-
dience to a Telemann ‘‘Vivace”’
as anencore.

—~—*The Country Wife’

by Todd Jones

Washington and Lee Theatre
Department’s first production
of the year, The Country Wife,
is a restoration comedy. The
play, written in 1765, deals with
adultery between friends,
within the tradition of the
period.

Much of the action centers
around Mr. Horner, portrayed
by Craig Walker. Mr. Horner,
at the beginning of the show, an-
nounces that he has gone to
France, and after an operation,
has returned a eunuch. The au-
dience finds out that he is ac-
tually lying, so that he may
seduce men’s wives without the
men being worried about him
being in their wives’ company.
Walker presents his lines clear-
ly and concisely, and makes his
part quite interesting.

One of the friends whom
Horner ‘cuckolds’ is Sir Jasper
Fidget, played by Chris Cart-
mill. Cartmill has one of the
more humorous parts, and
delivers most of his lines in a
high, squeaky voice. His man-
nerisms were very funny, and
delighted the audience.

A special Virginia Museum
exhibition, ‘‘Oriental Splendor:
Japanese and Chinese Decora-
tive Arts,” opens Tuesday,
November 17, in Washington
and Lee University’s duPont
Gallery.

The 29-object show is co-
sponsored by W&L and the

ZOLLMAN’S PAVILLION

While much of the action was
going on between Horner and
his friends, another plot was go-
ing on at the house of Mr. Pinch-
wife. Mr. Pinchwife and his
sister live together. He is trying
to arrange a marriage for his
sister and Mr. Sparkish. Pinch-
wife, played by Chris Lillja,
was effective as a brisk, angry,
demanding husband-brother,
but stomped around the stage
just a little bit too much. Mr.
Sparkish, played by Chuck
Turner had many resemblences
to Mr. Cartmill in his acting. He
spoke in a high-pitched voice,
and had many of the same man-
nerisms.

The sister, Alithea, played by
Paula Langdon put in an ex-
cellent performance. Her lines
were well delivered, and made
her part very believable. The
sister’s other love interest,
played by Brandon Davis, also
put in an excellent perfor-
mance. The dialogues between
the two of them were among the
best in the show.

Another good performance
was offered by Priscilla Lewis,

cember 17.

‘For the most part these ob-
jects are not fraught with deep,
complex meaning. Rather they
exist to please, to charm and to
give delight,’’ said Dr. Joseph
M. Dye III, exhibition curator
and Asiatic art expert for the
Virginia Museum.

ferent cultural and _ historical

as Mr. Pinchwife’s wife. She is
from the country, hence the title
of the play. Her accent was ob-
viously different from all the
rest of the members of the cast.
She delivered some of the fun-
niest lines in the play.

The three ladies that Horner
entreats, among others, were
played by Betty Kahn, Alisa Le-
vien, and Ginger McNeese. Also
in the cast was Professor Shill-
ington, who played a doctor,
who ‘“‘would never make a good
chemist.”’

Also included in the cast are
Greg Mausser, Andy Berisford,
Virginy Loper, Peter Moody.

The set, designed by Tom
Ziegler, was quite effective, and
very free-flowing. The play was

directed by Al Gordon.

The Country Wife, is well-
acted, but might create a few
problems because it is perform-
ed in its original form, possibly
much like it was in 1675. The

tions can be made by calling

made for export to foreign coun-

meant for use in their country of

were intended as feasts for the
eye.”

of the museum’s Rockbridge
chapter, said the recent
remodeling of duPont Gallery

goalie, and scored on a shot that
the goalie only managed to tip,
the game was all but over.

The Generals added three
goals in the fourth, two by
Johnstone, before Richmond
scored again with 1:05 left to
play. Freshman Bobby Pearson
and Peterson then tallied one
apiece to provide the final
margin.

Johnstone was the Generals’
leading scorer with four goals,
and he explained that ‘being
left-handed gives me a big ad-
vantage with the right post”’ in
that he can just catch the ball
and shoot, whereas a right-
handed player would have to
backhand the shot.

Remillard explained his
team’s uncharacteristically
poor first-half showing by say-
ing, ‘We were still thinking
about the big win yesterday
(over Richmond by a score of
14-6 in the second round), and
we didn’t prepare for a tough
opponent.”’

When the Generals fell behind
early, ‘‘We tried to get back
right away, and we didn’t work
as a team,’’ said Remillard.

 

 

Sports

 

 

‘‘As we let down, it allows an
average defense to be effective.
We did not pursue, and we did
not put on defensive pressure.”

Once again, Remillard cited
his defense as ‘preventing us
from getting blown over.”’

Washington and Lee converted -

on 40 percent of their six-on-five
opportunities for the game
while Richmond only made
good on 33 percent. In addition,
goalie Andy Gates stopped 79
percent of the shots fired at

him.

Six first quarter goals, three
by Peterson, had propelled the
Generals to a 14-6 victory over
Richmond in the second round
on Saturday. Although the
Spiders mounted a small come-
back in the second quarter by
outscoring the Generals 4-1,
three W&L goals in less than a
minute in the third quarter kill-
ed the rally. The first of these
came when Rock arched a high
lob from the left side of the pool,
over the goalie’s head and into
the right corner of the net.

Peterson connected on 75 per-
cent of his shots to lead the
Generals with six goals for the
game. Rock finished with 3
tallies, and Gates stopped 71
percent of Richmond’s shots.

100 percent is the best way to
describe the Generals’ first

round 24-7 win over James
Madison University. W&L
scored on all of their six-on-five
opportunities, an area of their
game that has given them some

problems throughout the
season. In addition, goalie Andy
Gates, playing only the first
half, stopped 100 percent of the
shots fired at him. In fact, his
hardest job was extricating an

before the game began. Also,
Peterson hit on all of his shots
en route to scoring five goals.

The Generals scored eight
goals in the first quarter, six of
them coming as a direct result
of steals, to end the game before
it ever really got started. Mc-
Clain tied with Peterson for the
scoring lead with five goals and
Rock, senior Mike Bernot, and
Keith Kadesky each tallied
three times.

he contributed to over half of
the 20 goals the Generals
managed this year. Moyer (two
goals and three assists), Elder
(two goals), and Poorman
(three goals) also led the
Generals’ attack.

Keeper Kirk Mancer, who
was able to keep the score
respectable in every game
despite the low offensive output,
was mainly responsible for
holding the opposition to an
average of just over two goals

Saturday’s contest with Rich-

been W&L’s biggest disappoint-
ment, considering they could
not score against a team with a
record of 1-14. But after the
Spiders took the lead in the
opening two minutes, the best
the Generals could manage
were a pair of thirty footers
from the right side by Simon,
both of which just missed the
far right corner of the Rich-
mond goal.

The Generals now advance to
the Eastern Intercollegiate
Championships at Brown Uni-
versity at Providence, RI, this
weekend, where they are seed-
ed fifth and will open the
tourney against, you guessed it,
Slippery Rock, the fourth seed.
The other first round matches
are (with seeds in parentheses )
Chicago-Loyola (1) vs. Rich-
mond (8), Brown (2) vs. Prin-
cipia (7), and Fordham (3) vs.
Harvard (6).

Remillard described the
W&L-Slippery Rock match as a
“toss-up’’ because the Rockets
are “bummed out’’ about not
being seeded higher, and it is
difficult to beat a team four
times ‘in a season (Slippery
Rock has won the previous
three games between the teams
by scores of 13-5, 10-8, and 12-8).
In addition, the pool at Brown is
all-deep with no shallow end, a
factor that should help the
Generals’ strong-swimming
club.

The third-year coach sum-
med up the team’s hopes for
this weekend just as he did
before the season began. ‘“‘We
are not a one-man team (teams
that have tried double-teaming
Peterson have not met with
much success),’’ he said.
“Teamwork is our ticket.”’

Gridders Keep Streak,
Down Catholic, 24-10

by Dale Park

The Washington and Lee var-
sity football team scored on its
first two possessions and went
onto a 24-10 win over Catholic
University last Saturday in
Washington, D.C. The triumph
was W&L’s fifth consecutive
and assured the team its best
record since an 8-1 mark in 1962.

W&L took a 14-0 lead in the
first quarter when quarterback
Al Paradise connected with
tight end Mike Fogarty for a
six-yard scoring pass to cap a
49-yard drive and tailback Chris
Cavalline dove in from one yard
out to finish a 48-yard drive.

Late in the second quarter the
Generals intercepted a Car-
dinal pass. W&L capitalized
several plays later when
Cavalline hit Paradise with a
32-yard touchdown toss that
made it 21-0 at halftime.

“‘T was really pleased with the
way we played in the first half,”’
commented head coach Gary
Fallon.

   

Gene Newton (No. 41) press

“We really didn’t

ures the Catholic quarterback (Scott

tighten up in the second half,
but our penalties and turnovers
not only kept us from getting on
track but got Catholic fired up.”

Relying principally on a pass-
ing game, Catholic mounted a
second-half comeback which
netted ten third quarter points,
including a sixty-yard touch-
down drive.

The Cardinals completed 23 of
43 passing attempts for 210
yards but Catholic also suffered
four interceptions, two of which
led to W&L scores.

The W&L defense stiffened in
the final period, and Bill Devine
added a 42-yard field goal in the
quarter. Devine’s effort, a
career best, tied him for the
single-season mark for field
goals at seven.

“We’re pleased to have a
good record and to have had
good performances in our re-
cent games,’’ said Fallon. “But
we still need to meet Saturday’s
challenge and to finish the
season on a high note.”’

“Saturday’s challenge’ will
be the Georgetown Hoyas.
Georgetown, a Division III in-
dependent, will bring a 6-2
record and a four game win
streak to Lexington.

Last season, W&L routed
Georgetown 36-7, rolling up 444
yards total offense and its
highest point production in
three seasons.

“Yet,” warned Fallon,
“‘we’re telling our players not to
judge Georgetown by that game
last season. Instead, they
should look at the Hoyas overall

record this season.”’

Game time is 1:30 p.m. on

Five Qualify

 

by Rick Swagler

In cross-country, a fourth
place finish in a field of six
teams signifies that the team
ran poorly.

The W&L cross-country team
did everything but have a poor
race and still managed to finish
fourth in the annual ODAC
Championship held this year at
Bridgewater College. As Coach
Dick Miller said, ‘We all ran
well, but we just didn’t run fast
enough.”

Finishing first for the
Generals and seventh overall
was Angus McBryde with a
time of 26:33. Frank Pittman
placed 11th overall and second
for the Generals, turning in a
26:57. The third W&L finisher
was Jon Kelafant in 19th place
with a 27:53. Steve Whetzle and

Greg Branan rounded out the

Generals’ top five, finishing
22nd and 23rd _ respectively.
Whetzle had a time of 28:00, and
Branan was close behind with a
28:16.

It was a very fast and com-
petitive meet, with only 18
seconds separating the overall
winner from W&L’s first
finisher, McBryde. By finishing
in the top seven, McBryde was
named All-Conference. Mc-

Harriers Fourth In ODAC

Bryde, Pittman, Kelafant,
Whetzle, and Branan will all be
running in the Southeastern
Regionals at Fisk University in
Nashville on Saturday.

Pittman commented that ‘‘we
don’t stand a chance of going to
the Nationals. We’re going for
the experience.” Miller is
slightly more optimistic, saying
‘‘we might get some individuals
qualified for the Nationals.”’

The final standings in the
ODAC are (1) Roanoke College;
(2) Lynchburg College; (3)
Eastern Mennonite College; (4)
W&L; (5) Bridgewater College
and (6) Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege. The Generals have never
placed higher than fourth in the
ODAC Championship and Mc-
Bryde is the first General to win
All-Conference honors in cross-
country.

With the Generals losing only
one runner in the top five (Cap-
tain Branan) and one other run-
ner (Tony Ierardi), the future
looks bright for the Generals.
Rumors as to the Generals’
freshman prospects are as
widespread as usual, but as
Miller said, ‘I don’t count on
anybody until they are enrolled,
have picked up their equip-
ment, and are running.”

Snookers Finish At 3-1

by Charlie Alcorn

This year’s junior varsity
gridders compiled a 3-1 record
which is far and away the best
season they have had since the
j.v. program was initiated four
years ago. First year head
coach John Bowers served as
head and has had great help
from his staff. The turn around
from past years’ horrendous
performances is attributed to
the great emphasis placed on
the program and the stellar per-
formances by this year’s
freshmen recruits and seasoned
sophomores.

The year started on a dreary
note when the team lost their

“first game to Division one

James Madison 36-0. Three
straight victories followed, 14-6
over Massanutten Prep, 27-7
over Western Maryland and 3-0
over arch rival Hampden
Sydney in Farmville.

Some. of this year’s offensive
Stars included quater back-
kicker John Thompson,
tailback Gene Girard and Dan
Jayne as well as tailback Tom
Wiser. A host of young linemen
did an outstanding job in the

trenches. The defensive stan-

douts incuded Mary Monasco

and Jim Lyall on the line,
linebackers Kurt Speck and
Roger Dunnavan, defensive
ends and backs Billy Morrow,
Dave Warrenfeltz and Ronnie
Travers.

The junior varsity team is not
a single entity like most major
college teams. The players are
integral parts components in
the W&L varsity scheme also.
J.V. players provide the first
team with much needed ‘‘look”’
work during the week-day prac-
tices. Most j.v. players do not
get to play in the varsity games

    

 

HUFFMAN’S

Plants, Corsages, Arrangements

mainly because of a new league
rule allowing a player to com-
pete in only eleven games, var-
sity and j.v. combined. The sub-
varsity games give players an
opportunity to show their wares
and serve as a springboard to
varsity action for some.

The junior varsity program
serves as a barometer for
future team’s potential. While
the W&L varsity is having one
of its best seasons in years.
things look good on the horizor:
too due to the performances anc
dedication of the 1981 junior
varsity team. Congatulations

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Don't Nobody Bring
Me No Bad News

When no one complained after the last issue, we figured it must
have really been a masterpiece. Our judgment was premature and
selfish, and finding nothing particular to humiliate us with, the
readership offered their observations about the Phi and journalism
in the broad sense.

‘*The newspaper here sucks,”’ according to Bill Roberts.

‘‘Why do you harp on the negative aspects?’ is the question on
people’s minds as their mammoth intellects lament the absense of
the campus comic strip, and as they turn to the editorial page,
salivating to see who is roasted this week.

The Inter-Fraternity Council dislikes our coverage so much that
‘t appointed two Public Relation Newshandlers to cover them for
us. The president of the Executive Committee and most of the rest
of the round table holds us partly to blame for the failure of some
amendments in last month’s referendum.

We should merge with the Law News, suggested an E.C. member
during the budget hearings. That way, we could work with ‘‘grown
men and women” and learn gobs about how real newspapers work.

When the president of the National News Service mentioned that

ollege newspapers were generally sophomoric, he got a tremen-
ous laugh from his audience of W&L professors and students.
-veryone turned to rib the Phi news editors in the audience.
‘oberts told him that the Phi was no good, and what did he think of

Roberts was referred to the campus Pulitzer winner, but the
Prizewinner doesn’t follow the Phi very well. The head of the
department had no comment: ‘‘The paper is strictly...extracur-
ricular.”’

Our humble staff is not trendy enough for this electric campus.
You call for Moral Uprighteousness, and we send your parents a
prophylactic ad. You call for Freedom of Expression, and we screw
the Country Wife.

The Executive Committee gave money to a Christian Fellowship,
but by the time we had gotten our typesetter in gear, they had taken
the money back.

But keep those cards and letters coming. We don’t care. We know
you are just handling the abuse so we won’t have to. We know it is
all just a satire to subtly hint to us what real nattering nabobs of
negativism are like. We know you love us. Or, at least, love to hate

Football Player Urges Attendance

Dear Sir:

I’m writing in regards to the
last game of the 1981 W&L foot-
ball season. At 1:30, this Satur-
day afternoon, the Generals will
host Georgetown on Wilson
Field in a quest for their sixth
consecutive victory and their
eighth overall. As strange as it
seems to me, a member of the
team, the stands will probably
be more empty than full.

I understand that the students

- are not obligated to support the

team..I realize that we are only
division three and far from the
glory and glamour of big time
college football. I know we're
not hoping for a_ bowl bid

lothe editor

   

against Pitt, Clemson, Texas or
any such teams. And on Satur-
day no one will crown a Home-
coming Queen. But in spite of
all that will be absent, it seems
to me the game would be an at-
tractive event to attend.

A victory against Georgetown
would conclude the Generals’
season with a record of eight
wins, two losses — the best at
W&L in nearly two decades.
And in fact, such a record may
earn the Generals a bid to the
divison three national playoffs.
Indeed, it’s probably fair to say
that losing seasons at W&L are
a thing of the past. With last
year’s record of 6-4, and a
guaranteed winning season this
year, over 60 percent of this

year’s squad will never have ex-
perienced a losing season at
Washington and Lee.

Finally, even though we play
for fun and for our own
gratification, support from our
schoolmates can be very uplift-
ing. Imagine how discouraging
it was to come out. after
halftime against Maryville, on
October 10, and find the fans
recrossing the footbridge in
droves. Now, Maryville was the
national offensive leader in
Division III averaging over 500
yards and around 40 points per
game. At the half, the Generals
had them shut out 14-0. Obvious-

[4

ly, the fans came to see the
Homecoming festivities. That’s
a painfully significant state-
ment on the respect the
students have for the team. But
perhaps size and stellar athletic
ability are not the most justified
objects of respect. Consider the
effort and dedication shared by
the football team.

We take pride in what we've
accomplished and in what we
are. We play tough, exciting
football and Saturday’s game
should be most enjoyable. |
hope we'll have your support.

Sincerely,
Bob Jenevein

 

Dear Sir:

This letter is in response to
the editorial that appeared in
the Phi ‘‘Country Ethics.”

While the posters used to
publicize ‘‘The Country Wife’
can be interpreted to have sex-
ual connotations, the innuendos
are obviously in the eye of the
beholder. The design of the
posters are typical of patterns
used during the Restoration
period for such everyday things
as wallpaper, tapestries, and
the like. If your eye detects
something objectionable in the
design, it is due to your defec-
tive sense of aesthetics, and not
an over-zealous publicity crew.

While half of the Phi staff is
looking up the word aesthetics
to see if it means something dir-
ty, I would suggest that the
other half might look at past

 

Reader Says Phi Has
Defective Aesthetics

issues of the Phi, namely the
first issue of the year. Making
jokes about contraceptive
devices was something most of] ©
us were fortunate enough to
leave behind in grade school.
Obviously, a few people on the
Phi staff never progressed
beyond that level.

While ‘‘The Country Wife’’
may have been bawdy enough
to elicit censorship in its own
time, it’s a sad commentary on
our society if we haven’t pro-
gressed beyond a 17th century
tolerance for fun.

Keep watch, all guardians of
morality at the Phi. We may
have a two for one sale on
‘Country Wife’’ posters, just
for you.

Sincerely,
Christopher M. Lillja
‘The Country Husband”’

 

 
Two At-Large Members
Rescinded By E.C.

(continued from page 1)
from their status as members
at large to the Publications
Board. Dawson, Lang, Hale and
John Vlahoplus, ’83 Rep., voted
against.

Debate on how to interpret
the relationship between Pub
Board and E.C. was tabled for a
later date.

:Honor Related Matters?

The E.C. voted unanimously
against letting the student body
overturn an honor case decision
by referendum. The subcom-
mittee had looked at a section of
the constitution which allowed
students to over-rule “‘any ac-
tion of...the Executive Commit-
tee,’’ and felt that ‘‘any action’’
included honor trials.

“Oh! that would be horribly
dangerous,”’ said Myers.

Vlahoplus agreed that honor
was covered in the White Book
and not the constitution, and
called such an interpretation
“‘mobocracy.”’

Morgan Griffith, ’83L Rep.,
noted that in dealing with the
honor system, they were agents
of the Trustees, and not student
body officers.

The E.C. appointed a
treasurer with a $1 per year
salary to comply with the con-
stitutional referendum of Oc-
tober. The treasurer is a
bookkeeper in Washington Hall,
who has been handling E.C.
funds for some time.

Percentage Budgets

The Committee voted 8-4 to
amend the constitution to delete
that student body funds should
be distributed according to a
percentage basis. What: this

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity journalism professor Clark
Mollenhoff will be the guest
speaker for the annual
Woodrow Wilson Luncheon of
the Woodrow Wilson Birthplace
Foundation Wednesday at the
Ingleside Club in Staunton.

Mollenhoff’s speech is entitl-
ed “Accountability in Govern-
ment: A Perspective from
Woodrow Wilson to Ronald
Reagan.” A Pulitzer Prize win-

Griffith said it had to do with
the old practice of giving the
Law School the amount of stu-
dent body taxes that it had con-
tributed. Griffith said that the
practice was too cumbersome
and complex to continue.

Vlahoplus said that the E.C.
already considers, ‘‘in the back
of our minds during budget
hearings,’ the percentage of
students served by an organiza-
tion. :

In other action, the E.C.
heard from Karl Sening,
chariman of the Cold Check
Committee.

The Cold Check Committee’s
treasurer had been called in
earlier in the year to answer
questions from Myers. Sening
said that he had sent out a
newsletter informing mer-
chants of his policies, as re-
quested by the E.C.

Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager : Trent Dickerson
reported that advertising was
down from last year, but that
the paper was as good as last
year’s.

There were no questions from
the E.C. about the quality of the
newspaper.

Viahoplus moved that Griffith
investigate several legal deci-
sions that have possible impact
on the W&L honor system. That
motion, and another that will
pay for copying costs, passed.

Hale reported that President
Robert E.R. Huntley had told
him, ‘“‘There’s no way in hell
anybody’s ever gonna know the
legal implications of our honor
system, and you boys don’t need
to worry about it.”’

Mollenhoff was formerly

section of table. Humble as it
was, it constituted a welcome
sight — somebody knew we
were coming. And at least we
had a place to sit...provided we
could find a chair. We ‘‘bor-
rowed” two from an adjoining
room.

The media-types were to have
access to a telephone bank.
Save for the private lines
secured by reporters indepen-
dent of the media represen-
tatives, the telephone bank was
a lone pay phone we found in a
deserted exhibition hall a floor
below the party. Fortunately a
couple of reporters near us of-
fered us use of their phones
when they were not using them.

We had access to a
‘multiplier box’’ from which
we could record speeches

Kirk Follo, Professor ef Ger-
man, finds in the series a
salutary antidote to the Herman

implies that the highest forms
of consciousness and wisdom
are omnipresent there. The

for example, of Siddhartha, was

popular to search for an alter-

directly from the podium. Our
spot was 30 feet from the
device. Our patch cord was two
feet long. Again, help came
from nearby reporters who
allowed us to patch into their
tape recorder. One of them said
he got his start at WLUR. He
must have understood our

predicament.

At times we wondered just
how useful our presence in
Richmond was. As one Rich-
mond reporter said, ‘‘There’s
no news here, except you might
get drunk or laid.’’ But other
reporters seemed amazed that
a school station would pay to
send four reporters that far
away. (Eric Fife and David
Donahue covered the
Republican ‘‘celebration.’’)

Our presence in Richmond
even allowed us to scoop some
of the real stations that evening.

is particularly pleased to have
the exhibition.

“Through this exceptional
outreach effort by the Virginia
Museum, we are able to present

Rockbridge County and beyond,

As we phoned in a routine
report the crowd was told that
the Associated Press and
United Press International had
just declared Robb the winner.
Other reporters went scrambl-
ing to call in the story. In the
process, though, we wore out
our welcome with one of the two
reporters who allowed us use of
a phone on the ballroom floor.
We hung up to allow her to call
her station in Washington.
Unfortunately for her (and us)
the operator stayed on the line
for five minutes trying to
clarify the details of who was to
be billed for the call.

She missed her newscast. We
missed getting to use her phone
the rest of the evening.

The other reporter went live
for the rest of the evening, thus
costing us the use of the other
phone available to us. So it was

back to the pay phone-in-
the-deserted-ballroom-a-flight-
of-stairs-away. The echo of the
empty room replaced the noise
of the screaming crowd of the
floor above. So much for effect.

Several other reporters used
that phone, as well. And most of
them — and most of the rest of
the reporters we came in con-
tact with — were more than
helpful. They must have
remembered being in our shoes
at one time.

A reporter from a Dallas
newspaper was not so helpful.
But a touch of poetic justice
came as we called in our final
report: He appeared in -the
room, hurrying to meet his
deadline. But he had to wait for
us to complete our report.

But other reporters had their
troubles, too. During Robb’s ac-
ceptance speech, a_ portable

television camera’s _ battery
pack died. The camera man
spiked it. Another technician
was seen crawling under tables
amidst dozens of wires and
cables. He had to plug in an ex-
tension cord.

WLUR and Cable Nine left the
air shortly after Robb’s ap-
pearance early Wednesday
morning. But the elated
Democratic partiers continued
much longer.

The reporters and the
Democrats had remained
separate during the evening
despite the physical closeness
to each other in the sardine-like
ballroom. But once the cameras
were packed up and the stories
were called in, the two seemed
to merge into a single party —
celebrating the end of a long
evening (and campaign) and a
long-awaited victory.

The show also reveals the
complex relationship that ex-

Japanese decorative arts
throughout the 500-year period.
Chinese techniques, particular-
ly those related to the manufac-
ture of porcelain, and Chinese
ornamentation made a deep im-
pression on the Japanese, Dye
said.

“Usually after an_ initial
phase of imitation and assimila-

Chinese approaches into some-

Dye. ‘Unlike the Chinese
