Fancy Dress 1982:
Night Of Elegance

by John Wells
Who cares if they went over

‘budget? The SAB turned out

what many consider to be the
best Fancy Dress in memory,
and that’s what counts.

The great success of the ball
was due largely to its relocation
in Warner Center — a move
which also contributed to the
cost overruns. But it was truly
an elegant, swellegant party.

Things started rolling Thurs-
day night when Cameron Hall
was filled with spectators to see
Atlanta Rhythm Section get
down. ARS isn’t a very attrac-
tive group, but it performed
dutifully in the face of a typical-
ly apathetic W&L audience
response.

The real fun that night was at
Zoliman’s Pavillion, where
brews were hoisted to the tunes
of Johnny Sportcoat and the
Casuals, who wowed the crowd
with their usual finesse. For-
tunately, the pavillion was not
as mobbed as it tends to be on
these occasions.

The ball was tremendous.
Those who parked in the vicini-
ty of the old train station were
treated to a fine view of Warner
gym, glittering with lights and
framed by the giant shafts of
lunar light that rivaled any
Hollywood premiere.

Coat-checking was orderly

and swift; faculty folks had
cocktails at Lee House before-
hand and a tiny room was set up
on the 300 level of the gym for
members of the SAB, E.C.
Calyx and Ring-tum Phi staffs.
Peons not falling into any of
those categories presumably
stashed flasks or relied on tap-
ped beer which flowed
ceaselessly.

The Diamond Jubilee
ballroom was dreamy: black
and white, sparkling white
trees, beautiful lighting and
gloriously-lit balloons hung in
luminescent bunches like glow-
ing pearly grapes. Lester Lanin
and his orchestra were at their
finest, with some delightful
vocals from. various band
members. Unfortunately the
band did tend to play some
tunes over and over (‘‘In the
Mood,” ‘New York, New
York,” and ‘“‘Tomorrow”’ from
‘Annie’ come to mind) and
seemed to think minks like to
boogie down to the emotional
strains of ‘‘Dixie.’’ Most people
probably didn’t care, anyway.

; The Champs d’Elysees was fun
if only as a place to pause to

take in the splendid view of the -

merry-making below. The Las
Vegas-Roaring Twenties-Monte
Carlo room was hot and crowd-
ed, and some partygoers who
didn’t go in may have missed a

great band, Eight to the Bar,
which also performed at SAE
the following night.

Doremus Gym — site of most

previous Fancy Dresses until

the Student Center came along

— was hung with a silvery tent »

and banners proclaiming past
F.D. themes. The room was
also hot, but never so much as
when Skip Castro lit up the
stage at 12 for ‘‘Boogie at Mid-
night” and the crowd went wild.
Skip was in excellent form,
strutting the stage and roaming
through the audience. Great

lighting. Anyone who wasn’t in-
terested could glide along with
Lester for the remaining time.

And it really went by too fast.

Young belles from near and
far swept along in their dresses,
which ranged from antebellum
hoops to current Princess Di-
inspired ruffled taffeta in
Shades of white, pink and light
blue. The men were quite
dignified-looking, some of them
in pretentious tails which were
stunning until you looked close
and saw that the shirt and tie
material resembled the cloth

 

they use in those big rolls of
bathroom hand-drying
dispensers. There were a few
nauseating tie-and-cumberbund
combos (the pink and green had
to go) and a pair of red pants
advertising a favorite soft
drink.

It was less crowded than the
Student Center used to be,
although not much cooler (bet-
ter access to outdoors) and less
liquid appeared to be spilled on
the floor, although that didn’t
prevent some from sliding all
over the place and eating tile. I
don’t think they cared, either.

Survey Indicates Most W&L Grads Finding Jobs

by Graham Osteen

Most Washington and Lee
graduates are seeking and fin-
ding employment and fewer are
going to graduate schools today
than in the past five years.

Every other fall, Michael
Cappeto, director of the Office
of Career Development and
Placement at W&L, conducts a
survey of recent Washington
and Lee graduates to determine
their employment and graduate
school paths.

According to Cappeto, the
survey was conducted on a
yearly basis until this year.
Because the results have varied
so slightly, it has been decided
to conduct the survey every
other year.

Cappeto. has found that
follow-up studies of recent
graduates are most valid when
conducted four to six months
after graduation, so the survey
is begun in October following
graduation.

A questionnaire designed to
provide information concerning
full-time graduate study, job
classification, starting salary,
career orientation and sugges-
tions for the Office of Career
Development and Placement is
mailed with a stamped, self-
addressed envelope to the
members of the recent
graduating class.

The response rate for the
Class of 1980, which is the most
recent survey available, was
83.2 percent, according to Cap-

peto. Of the 267 graduates who
responded, 30.2 percent entered
graduate and_ professional
schools as full-time students.
The other 59.4 percent of the
respondents are employed
while 10.6 percent are
unemployed, not seeking
employment, traveling, etc.
The five year average for full-
time graduate school atten-
dance is 34 percent.

Law school has proved to be
the most popular field of
graduate study. Of the Class of
1980, 14 percent of the class
entered law school on a full-
time basis, according to Cap-
peto, and this figure has re-
mained fairly constant over the
past five years.

Business school attendance
has showed a decline over the
past five years and only 2.7 per-

cent of the Class of 1980 pursued
MBA programs as _ full-time
students, according to Cappeto.

Cappeto said medical school
attendance has remained fairly
constant with 4.4 percent of the
Class of 1980 entering graduate
programs in medicine.

Graduate programs other
than law, business and
medicine received 8.9 percent
of the Class of 1980, according to
Cappeto, this figure has varied
only slightly from year to year.

As stated earlier, 59.4 percent
of the Class of 1980 obtained
jobs after graduation. The five
year average is 57.4 percent, ac-
cording to Cappeto.

To determine the type of work
recent graduates enter,
respondents were asked to
select the category which best
describes their present job. The
business professions, education
and the military were the most
popular careers of the Class of
1980, according to Cappeto.

“It is appropriate to differen-
tiate between a job and a
career,” said Cappeto.

‘According to most occupa-
tional therapists, a career is a
type of work composed of one or
more related jobs. Statistics
show that during his working
life, the typical college student
graduate will have three dif-'
ferent careers composed of
twelve different jobs. Also, to-
day’s college graduate is ex-
pected to keep his first job for
about two years,” said Cappeto.

According. to Cappeto, 53.2
percent of graduates who were
not entering graduate school
had received job offers on or
before graduation day. About 10
percent of the graduates receiv-
ed jobs in each of the five mon-
ths following graduation so that
by late October, only 7.6 percent
of the Class of 1980 remained
unemployed.

‘Unemployment affects only
an insignificant number of re-
cent W&L graduates,’’ said
Cappeto.

For the past five years, about
half of the graduates seeking
employment received job offers
during the summer months.

Based on this finding, according
to Cappeto, it is concluded that
seniors who are unemployed on
graduation day should not
become pessimistic about their
future.

According to Cappeto, labor
market specialists believe that
underemployment, the
underutilization of skills, educa-
tion and human resources, is
the most critical problem fac-
ing today’s college graduate.
Data gathered on the Class of
1980 revealed considerably less
underemployment than the
Class of 1979. Eighty-four per-
cent of the respondents who had
full-time jobs indicated that
their jobs required a college
degree. This figure is up
substantially from the previous
four years which averaged 69.5
percent.

Cappeto’s study shows that
92.6 percent of the humanities
graduates, 90.9 percent of the
journalism graduates, 90.7 per-
cent of the business graduates,
77.8 percent of the science
graduates, and 76.7 percent of
the social science graduates
who had full-time jobs reported
that their jobs required a col-
lege degree.

_ According to the study, those
students who reported that their
degree was not being utilized
showed a surprisingly diverse
cross-section of jobs ranging
from ‘‘young professional’ to
manual labor positions. It can
be inferred from this finding

that some Washington and Lee
graduates are definitely
underemployed while others
have obtained jobs for which
they feel overqualified, but
which a college education is
nonetheless required or prefer-
red for employment, according
to Capneto.

For the Class of 1980, the
degree of job satisfaction was
moderately high, and, accor-
ding to Cappeto, this trend has
remained constant for Wash-
ington and Lee graduates.

Of the respondents, 85.7 per-
cent of the workers indicated
that they were satisfied with
their job’s challenge; 67.3 per-
cent of the graduates who work-
ed full-time responded that
their job was consistent with
long range career goals; 67.9
percent of the graduates were
satisfied with their salary; 84.9
percent were satisfied with the
type of work they were doing
and most were able to find work
where they wanted to live
rather than being forced to go
where their jobs were located.

The median salary range for
Washington and Lee graduates
was $12,000 to $12,999, up $1,000
from 1979. Science graduates
had the highest median, $14,000
to $14,999 followed by the
business graduates, $13,000 to
$13,999, the humanities and
social science’ graduates,
$11,000 to $11,999 and the jour-
nalism graduates, $9,000 to
$9,999.

Cappeto Explains Job Market

by Tom Baker
High unemployment and a
depressed job market for col-
lege graduates are two factors
that have created concern for

college seniors across the coun-,

try, including many Waphing-
ton and Lee seniors.

According to Director. ,of
Placement Mike Cappeto, W&L
seniors, while not coed

from the problems of the
depressed job market, tradi-
tionally do well on the job
market.

In fact, the number of com-
panies conducting interviews at
W&L has increaséd: by’ three
firms. Cappeto noted that there
has been only a shght: cutback

Cappeto cited several reasons
for the success W&L graduates
have had in the job market.

First, W&L graduates have
performed well in their chosen
fields, enhancing the reputation
of the university in the business
community. ‘‘W&L produces a
good product,’’ said Cappeto.

Second, the Placement Office
“bombards”’ seniors with pro-
grams and workshops on fin-
ding employment.

Third, the office encourages
seniors to”begin their job hun-
ting early.

Fourth, the fact that W&L
students tend to look for work in
the economically prosperous
South (the ‘‘Sun Belt’’ region)
rather than the depressed
Northeast and Midwest in (the
“Snow Belt’’).

According to Cappeto, the
students who get the good jobs
are the ones who have a better
knowledge of the job hunting
process. Those that are
prepared are involved in a com-
prehensive job search. These
graduates know what they want
to do specifically and have con-
ducted a thorough analysis of
the job market to know what op-
portunities are available and
where they can be found.
 

 

 

A Film Of ‘Marble’

The Washington and Lee Film
Society will present Man of
Marble, directed by interna-
tionally recognized Polish
filmaker Andrzej Wajda, on
Friday and Saturday in Class-
room A of Lewis Hall. The
public is invited free of charge
to attend the screenings.

According to Carren O.
Kaston, assistant professor of
English at Washington and Lee
and adviser to the W&L Film
Society, Wajda’s films are
“remarkable for their ability to
show the meaning of politics in
human terms. They reveal that
history and politics are a part of
the people’s most intimate
lives.”’

Wajda was arrested by the
Polish government in the wake
of the military takeover in that
country in December. He has
since been released.

“The film Society decided to
assume the considerable cost of
showing Man of Marble
because this seems. the
politically appropriate moment
to bring Wajda’s work to Lex-
ington,”’ said Kaston.

Until recently, Wajda was
best known in the United States
for his early trilogy: A Genera-
tion (1955), Kanal (1956), and
Ashes and Diamonds (1958).

At present, two of Wajda’s
works are playing in New York
City: Without Anesthesia and
Man of Iron. The latter is the se-
cond film in a projected trilogy
in which Man of Marble is the’
first. Man of Iron has just been
nominated for this year’s
Academy Award despite

 

‘Il Barbiere

di Siviglia’

i Sivigl

Rossini’s popular comic
opera, ‘‘I] Barbiere di Siviglia,”’
which returned to the Met’s
repertory last month in a new
production, will be broadcast
live from the Metropolitan
Opera House on Sat., March 13,
at 2 p.m. over WLUR - FM
(91.5).

The cast for the broadcast
features Kathleen Battle as
Rosina; William Workman in
his Metropolitan Opera radio
broadcast debut as Figaro;
Rockwell Balke as Count
Almaviva; Renato Capeechi as
Doctor Baetolo, and Paolo Mon-
tarsolo, also in his Metropolitan
radio debut, as Don Basilio. An-
drew Davis is the conductor.

Written by Rossini when he
was only 25, “Il Barbiere di
Siviglia” is one of the most
popular operas in the repertory.
It is a charming story of
romance, disguises and playful
trickery set in 17th Century

Spain.
The single intermission
feature is ‘‘Texaco’s Opera

Quiz,’’ with panelists Martin
Bernheimer of the Los Angeles
Times; Martin Sokol, noted
teacher and author; and Paul
Hume of the Washington Fost.

 

Poland’s request that it be
withdrawn from competition.
Man of Iron , which concerns
the rise of the trade union
Solidarity in the Gdansk
shipyards, was smuggled out of
Poland just before the military
takeovet. Wajda’s subsequesnt

arrest gained international
notoriety.
Wajda had to seek permission

from the Polish government for
13 years before he was allowed
to make Man of Marble in 1977.
Still, the film was judged so
politically threatening that one
of its last scenes was censored.
Although the Polish authorities
refused to allow Man of Marble
to be officially screened at the
Cannes Film Festival, it re-
ceived the festival’s 1978 Inter-
national Critic’s Prize when the
French distributed it in a com-
mercial theatre in Cannes.

According to Kaston, Man of
Marble is much like the widely-
read novel ‘‘The Painted Bird,”’
by Polish author Jerzy Kozinski
in that the film concerns the dif-
ficulty with which the Polish
people achieve a sense of
‘*solidarity’’ among
themselves.

“In their tendency to suspect
and push away from each other,
Wajda seems to say the people
of Poland are their own worst
enemies, and it is in this context
that the brief triumph of
Solidarity was so especially
moving,” said Kaston.

The plot of Man of Marble
focuses on the efforts of a con-
temporary filmmaker, a feisty
young woman who encounters
many of the same obstacles as
Wajda himself, to make a
television documentary about
Mateusz Birkut, a_ heroic
worker lionized by the govern-
ment on Poland’s post-World
War II Stalinist period. Birkut
was even commemorated in
government documentaries and
government art — the marble
sculpture of the title — but has
disappeared from view.

Laundry Room Under Fire

by B. Scott Tilley

Much criticism has evolved
this year over the laundry
facilities, provided mainly for
freshmen, in the basement | of
Graham-Lees Dormitory. |

The complaints generally
recognize two major faults. of
the facility: the ineffectiveness
of the machines and the lack ‘of
security provided.

Freshman David McGehee
noted that ‘the dryers don’t
work well, and you usually have
to run them three or four
times.”” McGehee said he used
to use the Graham-Lees facili-
ty, but. now it’s ‘‘more conve-
nient touse a laundromat.” _

Wood Selig, a junior and a
dorm counselor, pointed out
that although the washers are
50 cents, as compared to 75
cents at a laundromat, ‘“‘you
don’t save any money because
you have.to run the dryer more.
It’s unfortunate they’re not in
better condition because it
would be more convenient for
the students in the dorms.”

Mike Shelton is one of several
students who have had clothes
missing from the laundry room.
Shelton claims his laundry had
been searched and four dress
shirts were deliberately taken.
Why did he leave them ex-
posed? ‘Because I couldn't
wait ‘en eternity for them to
dry,” he explained.

According to Dee Miriello,
who is in charge of handling
complaints about the laundry
room, the failure to remedy the
problem can be attributed to the
lack of feedback from students.
Mrs. Miriello’s boss, Gerry
Darrell, confirmed _ that
student have not stepped for-
ward with complaints.

“‘T had no idea that situation is
so bad,”’ said Mrs. Miriello. ‘‘If
they will call me when the
machines break down or don’t
work, I will reimburse them
and have Buildings and
Grounds repair the machine.”

Darrell added that if he
receives enough complaints
about one faulty machine, he

said that no machines have

As for security in the laundry

Miriello agree that responsibili-
ty is out of their hands. Darrell
suggested locking the door after
a certain time, a practice that
used to be followed when the
Graham-Lees dorm was oc-
cupied. Ultimate responsibility
for the building is not under
Darrell’s authority, however.

Mrs. Miriello concluded, ‘“‘If

SAB Holds
Meeting

by J.R°5mith
The atmosphere was rather
jovial at the Student Activities
Board meeting Tuesday night,
even though the major topic of
discussion was the $15-20,000 the
S.A.B. lost on Fancy Dress

weekend.
Co-chairman John Martin of-

fered that the S.A.B. is not in
trouble in the eyes of the ad-
ministration because it was the
administration who told the
board to count on selling 2,000
tickets. Only 1,400 tickets were
sold.

In other discussions, the
S.A.B. announced movies for
the weekend. My Fair Lady
will be shown at 7:30 p.m. on
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
The other feature, a porn flick
entitled Misty Beethoven, will
be shown at 10 p.m. and 12 p.m.
Friday and Saturday, and at 10
p.m. on Sunday. Admission to
My Fair Lady is $1. Admission
to the skin flick is $2.

Review:

‘Reds’ Should Earn

by Michael Judge

Warren Beatty’s magnum
opus, Reds, now playing at the
Lyric Theatre, is the most ad-
mirable and _ distinguished
American film of 1981. While
the current comparisons are
now being made between Reds
and other classics such as Dr.
Zhivago and Lawrence of
Arabia, Reds is certainly the
most ambitious undertaking by
an American filmmaker in re-
cent years.

The theme of the movie is a
grand one — the life of jour-
nalist John Reed, who chronicl-
ed and took an active part in the
Russian revolution of 1917. In
less adept hands, the film could

have become what so many

other American films do: a
mixture of empty spectacle and
stilled characterization (e.g.
Heaven’s Gate).

Yet Warren Beatty’s beau-
tifully controlled direction
treats the subject with in-
telligence and passion, and,
during a time when so many
American films cater to the
psychologically trivial, its
achievement is substantial. _

Perhaps what is so refreshing
about this film is that it appears
at a time when so many other
American films seem to be
catering to the trivial and nar-
cisstic aspects of modern life. It
is a pity to think that Reds’

Reds, though, is flawed.
However, it never condescends
nor surrenders its emotional
and intellectual integrity. While
powerful and moving, it never
resorts to strident emo-
tionalism to achieve its effect.

Despite strong direction, the
film’s real strength lies on the
intelligence of its script and the
brilliance of its cast. Warren
Beatty gives a steady and deep-
ly felt performance as John
Reed. Reed, led by convictions
to take personal involvement in
the Russian revolution, faces
bitter disappointment over the
corruption of the new Soviet
state. Yet he clings stubbornly
to his ideals up to the end. Beat-
ty asks us to recognize that
Reed is both a naive victim of
history and an example of an in-

Lax Team Dumped 16-7,

Will Face Navy Saturday

Hoping to regroup forces
after an ambush last Sunday
against a top club team, the
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team will battle the Naval
Academy this Saturday at 2
».m. on Wilson Field.

Sports

“We expect a_ typically
agressive Navy team,” said
Head Coach Jack Emmer. “On
defense they try to force you to
handle the ball under great
pressure. On offense they will
try to power their way to a goal
rather than using a settled at-
tack.”’

“Our success will depend on
control of the ball and especial-
ly control of the game’s tempo.
But Navy will make these tough

objectives to achieve,’ said
Emmer.

The match will be the ninth
meeting of the teams in a series
that was played in 1977, when
Navy edged W&L 13-12 on
Wilson Field. The visitors held
an 11-7 advantage late in the
third period before the Generals
closed the gap to 12-11.

Other scores from this close
series include a 1976 victory by
Navy (8-7), another win by the
academy in 1975 (14-8), a 19-8
Navy win in 1972 and a 10-8
Navy win in 1971. W&L has
beaten Navy a few times,
however. In 1974, the Generals
swept the Midshipmen twice in-

cluding an 11-9 win in the
N.C.A.A. tournament. W&L

also defeated Navy in the 1973
tournament, that score being
13-12.

One interesting aspect of the

Baseball Season Starts

by Andrew Hoppes

Coach Jim Murdock’s
Washington and Lee baseball
team will open its 1982 season
this weekend with home games
against West Virginia Tech on
Friday and Saturday and
California State (Pa.) on Sun-
day.

Co-captain Jeff Haggerty, a
.362 hitter last season, will start
at first base. Juniors Chris
Cavalline and Jody Harris will
anchor the middle of the infield,
while sophomore Dave War-
renfeltz will hold down third
base.

Tripp Brower will do the cat-
ching for the Generals. Mur-
dock described Brower as a
good team leader and one of the
best defensive catchers in the
0.D.A.C.

The outfield alignment is not
definite, but four-year letter-
man and captain Thad Ellis will
definitely be patroling center-

field. Ellis hit .393 to earn Divi-
sion III All-American honors as
a sophomore, but was hamp-
ered by a wrist injury last year
and slumped to .264.

Sophomore Mike Walsh, a
strong offensive player, will
probably occupy leftfield. In
rightfield, freshman Miles
Spencer and sophomore Mel
Cote appear to be the leading
candidates.

In the pitching department,
five seniors will lead the W&L
staff. Dave Randall and Rich
Hachenburg will be part of the
starting rotation, while the
other seniors, Jim Brockelman,
Don Dudley and Mark
McLaughlin, will also find plen-
ty of action. Junior Jim Stanley
and freshman Billy White fill
out the pitching staff.

Randall, Hachenburg and
Brockelman, were team leaders
among last. year’s pitchers.

heading to Anappolis.

According to Emmer, Navy’s
top personnel this season are
junior goaltender Scott Bart-
kowski, junior attackman Rob
Bianchi and Rick Wehman,
junior midfielders Phil
Skalniak and Richard Hayes,
and senior defenseman John
Korn.

W&L’s loss last week came at
the hands of the Mt. Washington
Club. The host Wolfpack used
its experienced players to hand
the Generals a 16-7 loss.

“They moved well, found the
open man well when we didn’t
pick up fast enough on
defense,” said Emmer. ‘‘They
scored a lot of goals that way.”’

W&L leaders were Geoff
Wood and Lee Heimert, who
scored two goals apiece. In
goal, Ware Palmer collected
eight saves, Mark Lukes had
four and Phil Aiken three.

Saturday’s match is the first
of three straight at home for the
Generals. W&L will play host to
Lafayette on Wednesday and
North Carolina State next
Saturday.

Veterans Pace W&L Golfers

by B. Scott Tilley

Washington and Lee’s golf
team, coming of a 12-0 dual
match record in 1981, has high
aspirations for the upcoming
year, hopefully culminating
with a championship in the
ODAC Tournament to be held
April 26-27 at Hampden-Sydney.

Coach Buck Leslie explained
that this team, as in past years,
has three goals. ‘‘We want to
have a successful dual match
season, we want to do as well as
we can in our tournaments, ex-
pecially the ODAC, which we’ll
be out to win, and finally, to

earn a NCAA berth at the end of
the year, which is highly com-
petitive but possible if we turn
in some good, low numbers dur-
ing the season,”’ he explained.
The success of the Generals
this year will rest upon their
veteran players. Senior co-
captains Bill Alfano and Jim
Kaplan are joined by class-
mates Titus Harris and Del
Agnew. Junior Tim Webb and
sophomores Whit Kelly and
Bruce Blythe will also con-
tribute, according to Leslie.
Though it is a veteran team,

Leslie stressed that he is
developing competition for the
starting spots to press the
seniors and to prepare the
younger players for next year.
The team opened its season
Monday and Tuesday in the
NCAA Division III, District III
Tournament in Sanford, North
Carolina. Leslie was very pleas-
ed with the squad’s showing,
which saw them place third
amond a field of 17 teams. They
carded a 633, finishing only
behind Methodist College and

Page 6, The Ring-tum Phi, March 11, 1982

 

Bennett Ross, the winner of the E.C, presidency in Monday's Big Three
elections, was interviewed the night of his victory by Ring-tum Phi
Vews Editor Todd Smith.

Phi: This year was marked by the telephone co-op, the Intellectual
Symposium, the constitutional revisions. What new ideas do you
see on the horizon for next year's E.C.?

Ross: As far as this year’s ideas are concerned, both the telephone
cooperative and the Intellectual Symposium are going to need a lot
of revisions. We’re still in the early planning phases. I don’t see the
Student Telephone Union, as it’s been officially dubbed, I don’t see

President-Elect

Ross Lays Out

that getting going until next year and that’s going to take a lot of
leg-work. As far as the Intellectual Symposium, the real test of that
is going to be this Spring, in preparation for getting things going the
next year. Bascially my plans for next year concern issues that I
think are relevant to students at the university, for example,
delayed rush. I think the Executvie Committee needs to look at
that. I would like to think the committee’s emphasis next year will
be on those issues, that we’re going to spend as much time on issues
that are of concern to students outside of the realm of the honor
system. I'd like to think that we could put that time into concerns of
students that fall outside of lying, cheating or stealing. Basically,
what about rush, what is the future of fraternities here on campus,
these kinds of basic questions. I think we need to be a little more
receptive, not just to complaints, but to suggestions about certain
aspects of the university.

Phi: I have heard that for every hour you spend in open Monday
night meetings, you spend three hours on honor matters.

Ross: That’s basically true.

Phi: If that’s basically true. how can you propose getting more
actively involved in everyday issues ?

Ross: The majority of the time spent at Monday night meetings is
spent simply to cover financial reports of the various subcommit-
ties, and that’s it. There’s no reason why we can’t cover other
issues at Monday night meetings. And it requires that we establish
a subcommmittee that works. We've established the Mock Intellec-
tual Symposium committee. If it takes that to work outside the
realm of the Executive Committees on Monday night, then that's
what we'll have to do. I think that given the fact we have this dual
role of being the primary body of the student government and the
judicial board, I think we should spend an equal proportion of time
doing both. I mean, obviously, our main concern is_ the
maintenance of the honor system. That’s why we're really here.
But I still think that it’s not necessary that we ignore issues thst as
student government officials we should take care of.

 

“We sit in a committee room

’

with a very limited scope.’

“what is this check here? Todd Smith for $8.99?” We have a list of
every penny that goes out of the account. The vice-president has it
on his desk. He should be able to take care of the information, at
least questions that he might have outside of regular Monday night
meetings. Think about it, we get a financial report that says
‘Miscellaneous — $300.’’ We don’t know where that money goes,
only the vice-president does and whoever sees the printout. I think
more can be done in financial aspects outside the meetings.

Phi: When you go into budget hearings next September, are you go-
ing to have some plan, or just a notion in the back of your minds, as

John Viahoplus has said, that you will consider the proportion of the
student body served by the budgeted organization?

Ross: I’m not sure, I don’t know exaclty how much we are going to
be working with anyway. (Ross stated that the student tax will rise
by $5). Given that increase in the pool, I really haven’t sat down
and thought out where it ought to go. But as far as general
budgeting procedure, I think one of the shortcomings of our process
is that we don’t have in front of the committee what the subcom-
mittee has spent in the past. It would be helpful, say, in the fall of
1982 to say ‘‘Here is what they requested in the fall of '81, here’s the
final year-end report in '82. Compare exactly how accurate they
were, for instance. Take the Outing Club which right now has
almost $15,000 in the account. We can say next year, given that
balance, that maybe they don’t need that much next year. As far as
saying ‘‘A certain amount of students participate in that activity,
therefore it should get a certain percentage of funds,”’ I'm not sure
that’s accurate. When you're talking percentages, it’s very hard to
estimate to what degree you're going to be able to cover projects
and plans. I'd like to see all the budget proposals, given a fixed sum
that we have to budget, cut out a lot of crap — sorry we can’t pay

‘for your parties, sorry we can’t pay for your receptions, this looks

reasonable, it’s yours. We don’t pass judgement on the Ariel or the
Ring-tum Phi, or those committees that provide a service. We don't
say, ‘‘Well, approximately 68.9 of all students read the paper and
therefore you should get these funds,’’ We say, ‘‘Well,. this is
reasonable. You provide a service therfore it’s yours.’ I think
this, coupled with the knowledge of what was done in the past.

Phi: You said you would like to see student opinion brought in on

 

 

Phi: Again, it’s just a question of pragmatics. Other schools have
solved the problem by dividing those primary roles of government.
For example, girls’ schools. Can you cite schools that do it the way
we do?

Ross: I can’t think of any off hand, but I’m not really well-versed in
schools of our size and schools with the unique honor system we
have.

Phi: What's so unique about our honor system?

Ross: You'll be surprised to find that not many honor systems are
geared towards a hearing. Most are actual adversarial systems
where there is a prosecution and there’s a defense. | cited, I guess,
last week that at Virginia Tech the average time for an in-
vestigative team to come back with a possible honor violation and
the actual hearing is three to four weeks. I think that would justify
splitting. Given the fact that we can send the investigative out, and
decide to go to the hearing, have the hearing, all within the span of
three or four days, I think that it’s conceivable we can do both. I
think maybe we ought to spend less time worrying about the
finances and spend a little more of the Monday night time devoted
to some of these issues.

Phi: Let’s go back to the subcommittees. In Willis’ year (last
year), the Phi applauded him for close monitoring of the student
funds and his tight reign on the subcommittees. How are you going
to keep up “heavy surveillance”’ and still have time in the meetings
for other matters?

Ross: At the end of every month the E.C. gets a computer print-
out of every check that that any subcommittee has written and any
deposit made. It’s printed out every for every account that we fund.
4 lot of the financial workings of each subcommittee can be dealt
with outside of Monday night meetings, I’m convinced. It will take
Morgan's (Griffith), the vice-president next year, sitting down with
the business manager of the Ring-tum Phi and saying

issues of delayed rush and coeducation. How will jou pull in student
opinion when students don’t write letters to the egitor, don’t come
to E.C. gripe nights. etc.?

Ross: If you accept the premise that we are representatives of the
student body, there is no reason why we as representatives can’t go
out and say, ‘Look, I’ve talked to these ten students and eight of
them were in favor of coeducation,” or just ask tig their opinions
on certain things. That’s not going to “sive accurate
statistical information. The only way you’re going to get that is
through surveys, that kind of stuff. What I want to know is, say, how

His Plans For An Effective Year

the students feel about parking. I mean parking js really bad at this
university. If you come up to campus you either get a two-hour
limit or you park in the ‘‘C’’ lot three miles from campus. That’s a
concern of some students, but they don’t want tosay it unless some
committee member says, ‘‘It sucks. It absolutely sucks, there’s no
parking on campus.”’ That’s a quote from some student. That’s one
means | don’t think we’ve utilized enough. Because we run into
students as committee members all the time, if you just stop and
say to someone you respect and has good judgement, ‘“‘What are
your concerns?’’ | grant that not many students wi!! come into your
gripe session and say, “‘It sucks,’’ but there’s no reason why we
can’t go out there and ask for comments.

Phi: How are you and the rest of the committee going to do this?
Ross: I think it can be put in such a way that it's not unreasonable
to think that every committee member be responsible to talk to
four, five students on a particular issue. We sit in a committee
room with a very limited scope. We tend to glorify the honor system
to an extent that maybe the ordinary student doesn’t. Or maybe it’s
not so high and almighty as we make it to be. We don’t know that,
we’re trying to maintain and upgrade and all that kind of stuff. At
U.Va. there was a survey that said that 25 percent of the student
body had seen an honor violation and nine percent admitted com-
mitting one. Do we have any of that information? Nooo...We have
no idea. We know the honor system is important here at W&L, but is
a similar occurence happening here at W&L as it was at U.Va.?
Well, we don’t know. Well, we ought to find out.
Phi: How are you going to get the E.C. todo that”

Ross: There are a lot of time restraints, people on the committtee
have a lot of other stuff besides the Executive Committee. But I do
not think it’s unreasonable to say, ‘‘Two weeks from now we're go-
ing to talk about Delayed Rush. I want to know the students’ views,
law students’ views, independents’ views, I want to know the views
of those students who are your constituents. Let's hear what they
have to say, not what YOU have to say.” I don't think that’s an
unreasonable working relationship, because that type of research
can be utilized. ;

Phi: And if it doesn’t work the first time, do you send them out?
Ross: I think it’s a function of leadership. It’s the president’s fault
if it doesn’t work because obviously I’m not getting across our
responsibilities, our responsibility to know how our constituents
feel. And if we don’t know that we’re not doing pur job. And if I
can’t translate that to committee members to fiiva out their consti-
tuency’s feelings, then I’m not doing my job. I hope that if Morgan
and Mike (Singer, Secretary-elect) and I go about it the right way,
it'll work. I think everybody on the committee knows his job. Cole
Dawson, for instance, is concerned about the freshman class and he
says he talks to people. And Morgan, for example, bringing in the
complaints. They’re sensitive issues and it’s just going to be put in
an organized system instead of just ‘‘a couple of students com-
plained to me about the sidewalks in winter.”

Phi: Perhaps instead of dividing the judicial from the legislative
side of the E.C., more importance could be given to established
bodies like the Universoty Council and the Interfraternity Council.
How do you perceive their roles?

Ross: The first thing to be done next year, this Spring, is to draw up
an organizational chart to say, ‘‘Here is our exact relationship with
Student Control, here is our relationship with all the faculty com-
mittees,’’ because we had problems appointing the chairman of
student control last year. We have problmes not treading on the
I.F.C.’s ground in talking about Delayed Rush. I think we need to
define those relationships before we decide upon to what extent
they exercise their rights and power in student government. I think
the I.F.C. is doing its responsibility as far as Delayed Rush.
However, given the fact that it represents a fraternity or an
organization, I don’t see how it can hurt to have the E.C., which
represents not only the 60 percent affiliated with fraternities, but
the 40 percent who don’t, to say, ‘‘Well, here’s how the other 40 per-
cent feel about Delayed Rush.”’ I’m not necessari-, Jure that that’s
going to be taken into account in the I.F.C.’s analysis. As for others,
the University Council, the Faculty Executive Committee, they
have their avenues of concern. I don’t know to what extent other-
wise they contribute to the interests of the students. There’s a lot of
potential for the U.C. I think they’ve at least discussed issues that
are relevant, and that’s the way it should be.

Griffith: A Law Student Vice President

by Todd Smith

on the ‘‘Big Three’”’ since student body President Beau Duddley, The law students who go over and socialize dont
said ina Tuesday interview that he believed he knew enough about b : 2 ‘

‘I don’t perceive it as a problem because I intend to go out and ‘
solve it,”’ Griffith said. The second-year law representative to the who don't go across ‘the great divide.’”’

Executive Committee ran uncontested in Monday’s election,
gathering 554 votes.

‘‘When I started last year as senior law rep I had to learn the
committees that dealt with the E.C. I knew the basic ones, cold

. check, Contact, but I had to go out and learn the rest.

‘‘Now my work is before me. I’ve learned a tremendous amount
this year. Hopefully, I’ll learn a tremendous amount next year.”

In an interview shortly after the election, President-elect Bennett
Ross stated that he intended to have the E.C. spend less time during
Monday night meetings reviewing the expenditures of the subcom-
mittees.

Ross said he intended for the vice president to do most of that
himself, in his unofficial capacity as treasurer, in order to free the
E.C. to consider other matters.

Griffith disagreed with Ross’ suggestion.

‘You might think, ‘How boring,’ if you sat in on (the financial
review of subcommittees ), but I think it’s good to do it in the open.”

One division already in full force is that between the law school
student body and the undergraduates. Griffith noted, ‘There is a
difference. But it’s not a difference that should make the two cam-
puses separate.”

He noted that law students are coeducated and often a good deal
older than seniors. Some have been in the business world already,
others have attended much different universities. ‘‘I think it makes
a difference when you're competing with people who have been in
the house of delegates,’’ said Griffith.

‘I think it’s simply a matter of bringing (the two campuses)
together on certain issues. That's been my purpose in trying to get
people from the law school on cold check and Contact.”’

The law students who go over and socialize don’t see the barriers.
They are mostly perceived by those who don’t go across ‘the great
divide.’ ”’

“I think it’s more a problem of ignorance than anything else,”
said Griffith.

Griffith said that he intended to see the two campuses come
closer together, but that he did not “see forcing any mergers of the
two newspapers or the two annuals.”

 

 

 

 

 

 

“Now my work is before me.”

 

“I certainly wouldn’t mind doing it behind the scenes, but I feel
its a sign of more open government to have them there before the
committee, where anyone can come in and listen to them, and the
Ring-tum Phi can report on it.”’ SS

What Griffith does think needs s¢ritinization are the Accounts of |
the Executive Committee. f

“I have only one real program for next year in mind, and that is
that the E.C. would make a report every month after the budget
hearings to report where our $5,000 is going.”’

Griffith expressed less opposition ‘to dividing the E.C. into
legislative and honor bodies than did Ross. ‘‘I would have to see a
plan before I would think about approving it,” said Griffith.

“There are basically two arguments against such a division.
First, with the honor body considering matters in secret, there
would be no way for the student body to judge what kind of job
they’re doing. Second, it is argued that by working on both honor
and non-honor related matters the E.C. develops a working
chemistry. I don’t find the second argument persuasive.”

Griffith thought there could be ways around the first problem,
such as the student body president serving on both. ‘‘We could look
into the way other schools do, We should definitely look into this."’

 

Griffith sees the Executive Committee as the primary student
governing body. The University Council and the Faculty Executive
Committee are ‘‘a wealth of information,”’ but are primarily ad-
visory in their relation to the E.C.

“Those two bodies can offer us great assistance but I think we
have to take the responsibility,”’ said Griffith,

About the Inter-Fraternity Council, Griffith feels that the E.C.
should take an active role in consideration of a delayed rush.

‘I’ve developed the Viahopian (as in junior representative John
Vlahoplus) outlook,” said Griffith, “that any matter that is of in-
terest to the student body is of interest to the E.C.””

‘‘T think as a matter of courtesy, not jurisdiction, we should leave

(delayed rush) with the IFC. But it is our responsibility to look into VP. -Klect Morgan Griffi th

the decision when it’s made,”’ said Griffith.

Others Made
Their Own
Kind Of Fun

by Tom Baker

While everyone certainly en-
joyed themselves at the Fancy
Dress ball, some students got
into predicaments that made
their Friday evening par-
ticularly noteworthy.

The first predicament oc-
cured at the photographers’s
studio, which was located next
to the batting cage in the gym.
While one student’s date was
trying to pose for the photo-
grapher, she lost her balance
and tried to regain it by grabb-
ing her gentleman escort.

Suddenly, the couple com-
pletely lost its balance and the
man, in an effort to stay
upright, grapped the backdrop
that the photgrapher was using.
Rather than steadying himself,
the would-be mink ripped the
cloth from its frame. The photo-
grapher reacted to the crisis by
returning the couple’s deposit
and asking them to leave.

Another student, perhaps
bored with the bands in
Doremus Gym, decided to
create his own entertainment
by getting into a fight with
another fancy dresser. The
fight was quickly broken up by
surrounding students, but not
before the participants looked
like they had used their tuxedos
to wipe the gym floor.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Turner’s Retirement Criticized

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Big 3 Elections

Something new can be found in last Monday’s Big
Three elections —- competition. In th past, Big Three
elections have held all the drama of a Soviet referen-
dum. Usually only one person has the interest to run.
The result, as one might expect, has been a less than
enthusiastic following of the actions of the Executive
Committee.

But this year, we were actually blessed with the
novelty of having a competitive race for the E.C.
presidency. All three candidates, Bennett Ross, Jim
Averett and Peter Collins, should be congratulated
for their efforts to improve the Executive Committee.

In reviewing last Monday’s vote. the results are
fascinating. Ross walked away with slightly more
than half of the votes, while Averett and Collins split
the other half. Had Averett and Collins not divided the
same voting bloc, the possibility is very strong that
this campus would have seen a run-off for the
presidency.

The other two campaigns were more one-sided, but
again we must congratulate all those that chose to
run. Though one might scoff at the poor results earn-
ed by a write-in campaign, one must also respect a
candidate whose efforts provocate new issuies.

That is what a political campaign is about, after all.

Fancy Dress 1982

While we have the time, we’d also like to extend our
congratulations to the Student Activities Board for
giving us Fancy Dress 1982. The combined efforts of
John Martin, Blake Witherington and Bobby Schmidt
gave us one of the finest balls in recent memory.

From Thursday night to Friday night, the S.A.B.
provided all Fancy Dressers with the finest in enter-
tainment. Whether you enjoy rock, soul, beach or
swing music, it is likely the S.A.B. had someone to
suit your fancy.

One alarming note, however, is the cost overrun
that occured from last weekend’s activities. S.A.B.
Treasurer Randall Jacoby has estimated the losses as
anywhere between $15,000 and $20,000. Considering
that the S.A.B. was given $55,000 to play with, this is
indeed alarming.

The S.A.B. says that part of the loss is due to poor
attendence. The S.A.B. expected 2,000 tickets to be
purchased, but could sell only 1,400. This is a surprise,
considering that Fancy Dress 1982 was a jubilee and
all.

What should the Executive Committee do when
next year’s S.A.B. comes forth with its budget?
Should the E.C. cut back on the S.A.B.’s funds
because of the losses? In this case, we think not. The
S.A.B. was given its ill-fated ticket advice from the
administration. The S.A.B. was therefore not
, operating under a self-concerned delusion.

The fun of attending the Fancy Dress ball shows
that everyone enjoys a party. The shock about the

cost overruns shows, however, that nobody likes to
foot the bill.

Dear Sir:

During my four years at W&L,
I have seen several injustices
committed by the faculty’
and/or administration. For the
most part, I have accepted ad-:
ministrative changes in policy,
with little or no conviction to;

speak out against them. Well,

enough is enough!

It has recently come to my at-,
tention that Dr. Charles W.:
Turner of the history depart-.
ment is being forced into retire- '
ment after some 30-odd years of '
service to W&L. I feel this is an

outrage!

Currently, I am being taught:
by Dr. Turner and personally I’
can see no reason why an in-'
justice such as forced retire-

   
 

Jothe editor :

ment should be levied against
this man. He isa fine gentleman -

and an excellent lecturer. His
enthusiasm for teaching and

concern for his students is un- |

paralled at this university.
I don’t understand how a
school that preaches ‘‘the good

of the student is always first” —

can so easily do away with such
a fine professor.

I would propose that instead
of some sedentary faculty com-
mittee making such a decision
that the students themselves be
asked to voice their opinion.
This only makes sense, for it is
the student who will be affected
(and hurt) by this ruling.

Dr. Turner is a fine pro-

Laundry Blues

Dear Sir:

I have a problem that has
been bothering me more and
more. I am a freshman without
a car and, as a result, I am
forced ‘to use the washing
machines under the Graham-
Lees dorms.

There is only one thing that

can be said about those

machines. (Expletive deleted).

As for the washers, there have

been a few occasions when I
would actually still see stains on
clothes ‘after they came out. I
ended up scrubbing them in my
sink, and they did come clean.

The dryers are simply a joke.
I have taken clothes out of the
dryer and they seem wetter
than when I put them in. There
is only one dryer that works
fine. Sometimes it will actually
get my jeans dry. But on occa-
sion other dryers actually leave
my sheets wet.

It’s ridiculous! I would ap-
preciate it if someone would do |
something about the quality of
these machines, but frankly I
don’t care because I’ll never
use them again.

Sincerely,
Henry Dewing ’85

Some F.D. Reflections

Dear Sir:

On behalf of all our students
who benefit so much from
adverse publicity, I would
like to compliment the person
or persons who created the
sketch printed on this year’s
Fancy Dress T-shirts. We can
be sure that every student who
bought one of these garments
for his date will be proud to
have her display for us the kind
of intellectual curiosity or
superiority which we always
strive to exhibit and which is
reflected in the deplorable
mispelling of the French name,
‘‘Champs-Elysees.’’ Such

 

Washington and Lee University

deserves a rating higher than
three stars.

On the other hand, however,
although I would have prefer-
red that Fancy Dress occur dur-
ing the first week after vacation
instead of the second one, I can
only admire the energy,
creativity and general behavior
of all those who were responsi-
ble for and participated in Fan-
cy Dress activities. To all the
students who received us so
warmly and made us feel so
comfortable, my wife and I
wish to express our sincerest
thanks.

Yours as ever,
A.G. Fralin

E.C. Announces Winners, S.A.B. Explains Losses

by J.R. Smith
and Ben Jarratt

The Executive Committee an-
nounced the winners of the Big
Three elections and the Student
Activities Board announced its
losses from the Fancy Dress
weekend at Monday night’s
E.C. meeting.

Bennett Ross won the E.C.

presidential race, gathering 333
votes, or 51 percent of the total.
Jim Averett finished second
with 163 votes (25 percent), edg-
ing out Peter Collins, who col-
lected 156 votes (24 percent).
Senior Law Representative
H. Morgan Griffith ran unop-
posed for the E.C. vice-
presidency. Griffith collected a

total of 554 votes.

In the race for E.C. secretary,
Mike Singer defeated Pete
Baumgaertner. Singer amassed
473 votes to Baumgaertner’s 53.
Baumgaertner was running as
a write-in candidate.

dividual possessed of both
courage and dignity.

As Louise Bryant, Diane
Keaton contributes the finest
role of her outstanding career.
Though she holds many of
Reed’s ideals as her own,
Louise also holds her husband
in slight contempt for the
stridency with which he defends
his cause. Their marriage is a
seldomly happy one, with
Louise searching for a mean-
ingful occupation as Reed runs
around the globe following his
convictions and his political
destiny.

Yet some of Reds most
powerful scenes are the ones
that reveal the well-spring of
love that rests underneath this
frantic relationship. The most
memorable of these scenes has

Reed and Louise, after years of
separation, meeting each other
in a crowded Soviet railway sta-
tion. They slowly walk toward
each other through the crowd
and finally join in what is sure
to become one of the film’s most
famous embraces.

Perhaps the finest perfor-
mance in the film is given by
Jack Nicholson, as the brilliant
and cynical playwright Eugene
O’Neill. O’Neill stands in sharp
contrast to the quixotic Reed —
wordly, disillusioned, hardened
by experience. He bitterly
dismisses Reed’s beliefs in a

few slashing sentences. Yet
O’Neill cannot surrender his
love for Louise (he has a short
affair with her before she mar-
ries Reed), or his unspoken ad-
miration for Reed’s depth of

Kolts reported that three loans
totalling $340 are overdue. Kolts
cited problems in collecting the
loans.

“Our basic problem has been
that we've been unable to con-
tact the people who owe us.
Some don’t have phones.”’ Kolts
also explained that- ‘Fancy
Dress is another reason for
problems in collecting the
money this month. People have
been holding out for the big
weekend.”’

Kolts was then asked to ex-
plain the criteria involved in
gaining a loan.

“It has to be a true emergen-
cy — we're not going to pay
your phone bill,” he explained.
“We'll give you money for
food.’’

Kolts also noted that student
transcripts and grades could be
withheld from students owing
money.

S.A.B.
Student Activities Board
Treasurer Randall Jacoby

reported to the E.C. that his

organization lost between
$15,000 and $20,000 on Fancy
Dress Weekend. Jacoby added
that after the bills for the Fancy
Dress expenditures come in, the
S.A.B.’s budget should be ‘‘pret-
ty close to zero.”’

Jacoby blamed the financial
loss on the lack of attendance at
Friday night’s ball.

‘Unfortunately, we didn’t get
quite the attendance we ex-
pected,”’ he said. Jacoby added
that the S.A.B. sold approx-
imately 1,400 tickets, way below
the 2,000 it had hoped to sell.

Class Elections

The Executive Committee
also announced the dates for
class elections.

Petitions from the candidates
vying for E.C. and class posi-
tions are due by March 15. Elec-
tions will be held on March 22

necessary, on March 25. Peti-
tions for the law school
representatives are due March

Generally Speaking:

Why Wasn’t W&L Invited To The Tournament?

by G. Bruce Potter

Some notes, facts and opi-
nions on the recently completed
Washington and Lee basketball
season:

The Generals’ 21-7 record was
better than 18 of the 32 teams in
the N.C.A.A. Division III Tourn-
ament. The tourney field includ-
ed such notables as Bethany
(15-7), whom W&L defeated
early in the season, Buffalo
State (12-15), Ursinus (17-10),
Stanislaus State (15-11) and
Whittier (14-12).

“IT spent three-and-a-half
hours on the phone Sunday
night (Feb. 28) fighting for
Washington and Lee and your
coach,’’ said William P.
Dioguardi, athletic director at
Montclair State (N.J.) and
representative from the South
Atlantic Region to the N.C.A.A.
selection committee. ‘‘I thought
that any school with the number
of wins W&L had, no matter the
schedule, should get in the tour-
nament,”’ he continued.

“I just couldn’t budge them
(the rest of the committee).’”’

There are three conferences
in the South Atlantic region, the
President’s Conference, the
New Jersey Athletic Con-
ference, and the 0.D.A.C. Up-
sala (22-3) received the at-large
bid to the region. Dioguardi ex-
plained that following
Roanoke’s 72-54 defeat of the
Generals in the O.D.A.C. finals,
there would be no_ point
in having the two schools meet
again.

“The other regions all
became very squeamish,” he
continued. “They only wanted
representatives from their
region (as opposed to an at-
large team from across the
country).

“That killed Washington and
Lee.”’

Although
Roanoke, the nation’s number
three ranked, three times, the
Generals also had their shares
of Johnson States, Shenandoahs
and Averetts. In addition, the
0.D.A.C. is not exactly one of
the more feared conferences.

In fact, Roanoke has ad-
vanced further in N.C.A.A. play
this year than any other

they played:

O.D.A.C. school previously. The
Maroons beat Montclair State
and Upsala to win the South
Atlantic Regional and now ad-
vance to the national quarter-
finals against Brooklyn College
this weekend.

The scary thing about that is
this was supposed to be a
rebuilding year for the
Maroons, and they will lose only
one senior, guard Tony Bond.
Other 0.D.A.C. teams to watch
out for next season include
Maryville, which came ex-
tremely close to upsetting W&L
twice and will not lose a starting
player, and Hampden-Sydeny,
which will be very deep.

Of course, W&L Head Coach
Verne Canfield has to be looking
forward to next year, as his
squad loses only two players —
guards George Spears and Ken
Jaffe, a reserve. Who will
replace Spears? The top can-
didates appear to be Henry
Bond, Chris Baldwin, or even
one of the freshmen players,
Lex Fitzhagen, Kevin Mc-
Clatchey andDavid Wilkinson.

The Generals will have the
same set of forwards, John Lee
Graves, Brian Hanson, Jay
Fechtel and Scott Shannon, as
this year, and Jackson Mac-
Farlane will provide an ade-
quate backup to the vastly im-
proved Frank Eppes, although
the 6-8 freshman could do with
putting on a few pounds...

This is the time of year that
selections to the all-whatever
teams are made, so how about
the all-airball team? Of course,
the captain of the squad would
be Roanoke’s David ‘Air Ball’’
Foutz. He shot an air ball when
the Generals downed the
Maroons, 62-61, in Warner
Center, was credited with miss-
ing a dunk later in the season, -
and badly misfired on his only
shot in the 0.D.A.C. final, just
grazing the rim. And he’s only a
sophomore...

And how about the play-of-
the-year for the Generals. Here
are a couple of suggestions. The
first came against Catholic on
Feb. 4, W&L up 70-51 with 2:45
left in the game. Baldwin made

Coach Is Optimistic
About Track Team

by Rick Swagler

Washington and Lee’s track
team opens its 1982 season this
Saturday at Davidson College.
Coach Norris Aldridge says that
his team has more depth in the
distance events yet is still lack-
ing in the field events.

One event that he cannot
worry about is the pole vault.
Vaulter Gene Fellin broke the
school and conference records
last year with a mark of 14 feet.
Aldridge said that Fellin ‘could
add to his pole vault record’’
before the year is over.

Aldridge said he expects
“Kevin Kadesky to break the
100-meter record, Chris Busbee
to break the 400-meter record
and Jon Kelefant could break
the 5,000-meter record.”’

The W&L track team is young
and will rely heavily this year
on the performances of several
freshmen. Despite the youth of
the team, injuries sustained

during the indoor season, and

the adverse weather, Aldridge ~

is optimistic of the season.

“We have some excellent
talents, we'll make a good
showing and probably have a
winning season. The 0.D.A.C.
Championships are here this
year and we could win them if
we keep improving.”

Because the Championships
are at Wilson Field, Aldridge is
hoping for more student sup-
port. ‘‘A lot of the Spring sports
— track, tennis, baseball and
some of our Winter sports —
swimming and wrestling, don’t
get much student support. A lot
of the students probably don’t
know they’re going on. It helps
if they come out and watch our
guys because they work hard.
They’ve put a lot of time into
it...a lot of effort. They’d really
appreciate some _ support,
especially for the O.D.A.C.
meet here on the first of May.”

a steal and raced downcourt. A
Catholic player got in front of
him and although the
sophomore guard could have
taken the ball to the hoop
anyway, he spotted Spears
breaking down the middle and
made a _ perfect over-the
shoulder pass. Spears,
however, had so much momen-
tum that he missed the layup,
but Eppes was right behind him
to tap the ball home and be foul-
ed in the process.

The second came in the
quarterfinal against Eastern
Mennonite. Henry Bond went

and six complete games in his
first year with the squad.
Hachenburg finished with.a 4.75
e.r.a. while Brockelman com-
piled a 2-3 record.

Slowing the team’s prepara-
tions for this weekend’s action
was the inclement Lexington
weather. The team was forced
to practice indoors for the last
two weeks as a result of sloppy
field conditions. Murdock
believes, however, that his club
has a chance to practice out-
doors at least twice this week.

As for predicting where the
Generals will finish in league

play, Murdock stated that “‘bar- .

ring any injuries, we should do
o.k.”” Murdock sees Bridge-
water and Lynchburg as the
toughest opposition in the
0.D.A.C., although the league
has no really weak teams this
year.

loose ball, only to have it hit out
of bounds before he could reach
it. His momentum carried him
right out of the gym, and he
stayed in the hallway for about
15 seconds before returning to
an ovation. He’s so quick that he
probably took a shower and

time span...

Here’s an interesting fact:
Every time the Generals scored
under 60 points, they lost. And
whenever they scored more
than 67 points, they won.
