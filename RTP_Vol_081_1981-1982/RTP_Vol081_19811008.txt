Sounds Off
On Budgets,

White Books
And The EC

| by John Wells

 

 

 

Would you care to respond to criticism in last

| week's paper for conducting budget hearings into the
| wee hours of one night?

Well, I think that from the stand-point that peo-

| ple on the committee as well the subcommittee
| representatives would be more rested, possibly

more awake from that standpoint it’s possible that
it may have been better to have it on two nights.
But from the stand-point of the Executive Com-
mittee, in the past we've done it in one night to
preserve a lot of the continuity of thought which
goes into the budget hearings. Working with a cer-
tain pool of money and having all requests done in
one night preserves the flow by which committee
members take in the information and disseminate
it. Ithink that outweighs the possibility that people
will get tired and blow it off. I think that all the
committee members, even though it might be late,
try to maintain their composure and take that into
account — that they are getting tired and that
these requests are being made and the later ones
should be considered just as important as the in-
| itialo ones.

Regarding budget considerations, do you have a
general idea of how funds should be allocated before
the hearings or do you base your decision on in-
dividual needs as presented by the various subcom-
mittees?

Well, we base our decisions on a number of fac-
tors; one would be a committee’s past perfor-
mance and past allocation. We feel that if a com-
mittee has done a certain job up to this point and
established a record of success they should be
allotted at least the same amount, if it’s possible to
do that, as in the past. Another factor is that we try
to encourage as many new clubs as we can by
allotting them funds to start up. We try to weigh
the interest of the established clubs against the re-
quest of new and upcoming clubs, such as the
outing club and the computing machinery club.
Clubs like that look to the E.C. for really their first
breath of life.

Do you think last year’s White Book revisions will
enable you to conduct honor trials more effectively
than previous committees?

Pruning only a $400 allocation
for a Christian group, the Ex-
ecutive Committee ratified its
final budget for the school year
at a Tuesday night meeting.

The budget distributes $98,950
in student body funds to thirteen
student organizations, and to
E.C. accounts.

Debate on the preliminary
allocation to the Inter-Varsity
Christian Fellowship lasted
almost 90 minutes. President
Frank Williams of IVCF attend-
ed with eight of the group’s
leaders. Jon Pakula and Bill Ar-
cher brought Dr. David R.
Novack of the sociology depart-

ment and four ot.iers to protest
the funding of the Christian
group.

Pakula presented a petition of
110 signatures challenging the
use of student body funds by
any religious group.

‘We just don’t believe,”
stated Pakula, ‘‘in the student
funding of a group whose
religious orientation may be
counter to that of some
members of the student body.”’

Williams argued that no mat-
ter what goals an organization
had, someone would object to it.
Gary Carneal claimed that
IVCF had a right to student
funds because it represented a

IFC Seeks Compromise

by Steve Perry

The Interfraternity Council
unanimously supported a pro-
posal Tuesday night that may
put an end to the ongoing pro-
blems between fraternities and

the Lexington community.

Police Cas Myeteriously Crashes

by Tom Baker

A Lexington patrol officer’s
car was mysteriously moved
and wrecked while he was in-
vestigating the Sigma Nu house
for a noise violation last Satur-
day night.

Patrolman Torben Pedersen
had entered the Sigma Nu house
around 1 a.m. to close down a
band for playing too loud.

“I had put the car in park,
removed the key from the igni-
tion, put the key in my pocket
and left it unlocked; which is
normal procedure,”’ said Peder-

n. “I went inside the frater-
nity to shut down the band and
returned five minutes later,’’ he
continued ‘‘and found the car

smashed against the war

memorial (at the Washington

and Lee University gates ).”’
According to Pedersen, the

 

car can -_ be shifted out of
park when the key is in the igni-
tion switch. Pedersen said the
car’s gear lever was still in the
“‘park’’ position when he found

it. Pedersen said the ‘car had
rolled down Henry St. and was
blocking traffic on Jefferson
Ave.

Pedersen did not think that
students at the party were in-
volved but theorized that the
cruiser may have rolled out of
gear by itself. The cruiser is
made by Ford, which has had
trouble with this model’s
transmissions. Damage to the
automobile was estimated at

$1000.
In other police matters,
Sigma Chi, Pi Kappa Alpha,

Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Phi
Kappa Sigma, each were cited
for violations of the city’s noise
ordinance.

The proposal, which will be
presented to the Lexington City
Council, was drafted by an IFC
subcommittee composed of
several fraternity presidents.
The subcommittee was chaired
by John McIntyre.

The two-part proposal re-
quests the Lexington Police
Department to give W&L fra-
ternities a warning before clos-
ing down a party for noise viola-
tions. The IFC also requested
that amplified music be permit-
ted up tola.m.

In return for these conces-
sions, fraternities would make a
greater effort to clean up the
outsides of houses following
parties. The IFC also voted to
hire a person to clean up litter
left on public property when
party-goers migrate from one
house to another. The last
measure would not be im-

plemented until next year,
however.
In other business, McIntvre

ing presence of uninvited VMI

NUMBER 4

EC Denies IVCF Request

significant constituency of
Washington and Lee students
who must pay the $55 activities
fee that goes to the E.C. budget.

Morgan Griffith, senior law
representative, said he regret-
ted his vote last week in favor of
the IVCF allocation, and stated
that he thought religion was too
personal a matter for the E.C.
to be involved in.

Archer said that although this
was not a state government,
“the constitution is our
heritage,’ and therefore first
amendment privileges should
be respected and “religious
groups should not dip into
public funds.”’

Secretary Bennett Ross com-
mented, ‘‘I think this (IVCF) is
the social life for a lot of peo-
ple... This is something the
committee has been grossly
negligent in — providing alter-
native ‘life styles’ for people
outside the mainstream.”’

‘You could fund the Indepen-
dent Union,”’ answered Pakula,

REVIEW aad OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Lions 4.00
Christians 0

‘Just exactly what is your criteria for funding stu-
dent organizations?’ asked the president of the Inter-
Varsity Christian Fellowship at Tuesday’s Executive
Committee meeting.

It seems the E.C. criteria does not include funding a

religious group, as the tentative $400 allocation to

IVCF was revoked (see page one).

The criteria excludes sleeping bags, picnics and In-
foton computer terminals. The criteria includes
oranges, scrum sleds and porno weekends. If there
are no solid criteria to form an E.C. funding policy,
the lack of criteria can form a policy. It is a policy of
neglecting the minority.

As Secretary Pennett Ross put it, the E.C. has
grossly neglected students outside the mainstream.
Such negligence promotes conformity.

One group of students don’t enjoy foreign films, G.
Gordon Liddy or SAB entertainment. How will the
E.C. give each of these people their 55 dollars’ worth
($55 is the amount of student tax paid with tuition) ?

Funds for the IVCF would have paid for speakers
for all to hear, films for all to see, and conferences for
all to attend. The Christian group would have con-
tinued to pay for its non-alcohol theme parties. It
would not have been reimbursed as a counseling
center for freshmen and foreign exchange students.

The E.C. tries to encourage new clubs by funding
them, said President Eric Myers in a Ring-tum Phi
interview. If the E.C. wanted to promote alternatives
to the SAB-frat scene, it would wait for the coming of
a group that filled the prescription . The Independent
Union came by several years ago, but without student
support it died. Now Inter-Varsity comes along, with
a constituency, an alternative, the admiration of even
its budget-foes, a record of service and a stable
future, and the E.C. ‘‘nukes’”’ it as a bad precedent.

Because the precedent of toying with the constitu-
tion was dangerous, law students must wait ten weeks
before their freshman representative is elected.
Because the precedent of supporting religion with stu-
dent funds is dangerous, a significant number of
students will not get their money’s worth from the

‘The IFC Offer

The proposal developed at Tuesday night’s session
of the Interfraternity Council offers the city of Lex-
ington an opportunity to prove its sincerity in claim-
ing to be a friend of the fraternity system. The IFC’s
proposal is not a headstrong demand. It is a com-
promise — nothing more and nothing less.

In the true diplomatic sense, one hand will wash the
other in this offer. Fraternities will, in theory, keep
their partying cleaner if the police department agrees
to be less Entebbe-like in its enforcement of city noise
ordinances.

One flaw in the IFC’s offer may be the request to ex-
‘end the deadline for amplified music to 1 a.m. Will
‘he city agree to a compromise when the compromise
is an extension of the fraternities’ privilege to make
noise?

We see this offer as an indication of the city’s opi-
nion of the W&L fraternity system. If the proposal
goes through, we may see a new era of cooperation
between the community and fraternities. If it fails, we
face a return to the senseless hostility and tension be-
tween the two parties.

Complains

Dear Sir:

I've noticed in your latest
issues of the Ring-tum Phi that
the cross-country team has
received good coverage, which
is good to see. But I’ve also
noticed that there has not been
one mention of the new assis-
tant cross-country coach —Paul
Thompson.

Paul is a second-year law stu-
dent here at W&L and a 1977
graduate of the University. He
still holds the W&L record in the
mile: 4:15. He has been working
out with the team, supporting
them, going to the meets and is
really the power behind the
team’s fantastic improvement.

Incidentally, Paul is helping
out on a volunteer basis. With-
out taking anything away from
coach Dick Miller, I hope that in
the next article Paul can be
mentioned — he really deserves
it. Ask anyone on the team.

Thank you very much

Political Magazine Started

by B. Scott Tilley

New to Washington and Lee
students this year will be the
publication of a new magazine,
“The W&L Review.” The brain-
child of two third-year law
students, Eric Anderson and
David Black, the magazine’s
purpose is to provide W&L
students with a commentary on
political current events and
theory.

“We felt W&L was an ex-
cellent campus for something of
this nature,’ said Anderson,
‘‘because the student body is so
politically active. The under-
graduates tend to be very con-
servative, perhaps one of the
most conservative Campuses in
the country, and the law
students tend to be liberal; so

we should have a_ broad
perspective of views.”

The “Review” will be con-
cerned with national topics,
though some state, local, and
school topics may be discussed.
The depth of current events will
depend on the publication date,
tentatively scheduled for late
February.

Besides basic decisions that
have yet to be made, the
primary problem is money.
“We anticipate a budget of
$1150,’ explained Anderson.
“The Executive Committee has
tentatively allocated us $600,
and we expect $200 in advertis-
ing. We are currently looking
around for other sources. We
are hoping to be allocated some
more by the E.C.”’

Dartmouth and Brown cur-
rently publish similar reviews,
added Anderson. ‘‘They publish
every couple of weeks, but are
only four pages in length. We

hope through one big issue we,

can print in-depth stories that
are well-researched, not short,
trite ones,”’ he explained.

The review is open to all
undergraduate and law stu-
dents. There will be an
organizational meeting for all
interested students Wednesday,
October 14 at 8 p.m. in room 114
of the Student Center.

Anderson concluded that “‘if
interests this year are up for the
idea, we hope it can be publish-
ed more frequently in years to
come.”

“I think his point is well-

what I have heard from

does not provide alternatives to

IVCF what to do, said Junior-

but should they change their
name and continue to offer
counseling, speakers, and an
alternative program of enter-
tainment, they could reapply
later for E.C. funding.

EC Seeks Revision
Of Constitution

by Todd Smith

The Executive Committee
discussed ways to amend and
revise its outdated constitution
at Monday night’s meeting.

Last year, the committee’s
amendments were approved
by students on several occas-
sions. However, in none of the
referendums did a majority of
students cast ballots, so the
amendments failed.

Secretary Bennett Ross sug-
gested that the ballots for a-
mendments be connected to the
ballots for freshman and first
year law student elections, so
that freshmen and law students
would be casting a ballot for the
amendments if they voted in
the election even if they did not
vote on the constitution.

Suggestions that polls be
located in the dining hall and on
Main Street and Junior Repre-
sentative Frank Smith’s idea
that every student be forced to
cast a vote, were all dismissed
as unconstitutional.

“Last year I voted to change
the constitution without student
approval,’’ said President Eric
Myers, “‘but-when you do that, it
snowballs. Then the constitu-
tion becomes meaningless;
then everything we do becomes
meaningless, and what you get
is a power vacuum.”

Myers pledged to try to en-
courage students to vote for the
changes, and exorted other
committee members to do

likewise.

Ten Professors Take Leaves

Ten Washington & Lee
University faculty members
are on leaves of absence this
fall and are undertaking
research projects ranging from
a study of geomorphic pro-
cesses to an examination of
alternative Christian  ap-
proaches to economic justice.

Three faculty members are
pursuing their research abroad
during the fall term: Edwin D.
Craun, associate professor of
English, is carrying out
research on Medieval and
Renaissance narrative tragedy
at the University of Oxford; L.
Randlett Emmons, professor of
biology, is at the University of
Basel in Switzerland; studying
immunogenetics; and, Emory
Kimbrough Jr., professor of
sociology, is at Chung Chi Col-
lege in Hong Kong where he is
involved in research on the ex-
tent to which the writings of
Charles Darwin have influenc-
ed sociological perspective.

Thomas P. Burr, Esq.,
Wessex Regional Officer of the
English National Trust, will lec-
ture on Stourhead, the 18th cen-
tury garden of which he has
special charge, on Tuesday at 8
p.m. in Washington & Lee Uni-
versity’s duPont Auditorium.

Burr’s illustrated lecture,
‘‘Stourhead — The Creation of
the English Landscape
Garden,”’ is the first in W&L’s
Fall Lecture Series ‘‘The Art

said Mrs. Mason, ‘‘but he either
cut the strap or it broke.”’

Mrs. Mason said she fought
back, but the assailant knocked
her on the sidewalk and then
ran off with the purse. Mrs.
Mason said she received a head
injury ‘either when I fell or he
hit me. I’m not sure.”’

The assailant ran through the
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity
yard as Mrs. Mason chased
him, but she lost him on
McDowell St.

Lexington police are now in-
vestigating the incident.

‘Endless Film’

by Todd Jones

I'm sure that many students
here at W&L are occasionally
discouraged by the fact that this
is an all-male school.
Sometimes having women only
on Wednesdays and the week-
ends does not seem sufficient. If
you are ever wallowing in self-
pity about the lack of female
companionship, go see Endless
Love. Endless Love will make
you happy if you see a woman
once every month

David Axelrod will not be see-
ing his girlfriend Jade for a lit-
tle while. He spent two years in
a mental institution only to see
her once and then go to prison.
Not a happy life for someone in
love as much as Dave is. The
movie ends giving you a feeling
of utter depression, not only
because Dave is in such a bad
state, but also because you
spent three dollars that could
have been spent much more

wisely on, say, an_ electric
potato peeler.
Endless Love has_ been

nicknamed Endless Movie for
good reason. The plot goes on,
and on, and on. I can think of
about four places that the movie
should have ended, but didn’t.
Part of the problem is that the
movie’s plot is a tad unbeliev-
able. In an early scene, Jade’s
father tells Dave that he is not
to come over to their house for a
month. If you were Dave, what
would you do? Probably sneak
off and meet somewhere else.
What does Dave do? He sets fire
to Jade’s house. Really natural,
right? Later, Jade’s father sees
Dave in New York. He decides
to chase him but forgets that
there is a taxi going 60 miles an

hour directly in front of him.
Needless to say, the father hits
the road, literally. Such in-
cidents as these make the
movie quite hard to swallow.

Brooke Shields plays Jade,
the girl Dave, played by Martin
Hewitt, is in love with. Brooke
plays her part well, mainly by
smiling and showing us all why
Dave has good reason to love
her. Her part is actually sur-
prisingly small, however, com-
pared to Hewitt’s role.

Hewitt is good in his role, but
really lacks the excellence that
is demanded for the complexity
of his part. The whole movie
centers around Dave's obses-
sion with Jade. Hewitt does his
best, but the part just seems to
be too big for him.

The movie is not without good
characters or high points.
Jade’s mother, played by Shir-
ley Knight, is very enjoyable.
Her characterization of a liber-
al-minded mother is done so
that she borders on eccentric,
yet remains very believable.
The viewer understands that
the love she sees between David
and Jade is the love that she has
never experienced with her hus-
band. In her last line in the
movie, she tells her daughter
that she deserves everything.
We realize that actually the
mother is the one that deserves
everything, but apparently will
never get it.

Richard Kiley, who plays
David's father, puts in a good
performance. He is a lawyer
who has spent too much time
with his clients and not enough
time with his son. In what I
think is the best scene in the
movie, he talks with his son

   

CONCERT

 
    
 
 
  
    
    
    
    

after Dave has just been releas-
ed from the mental institution.
He explains that he understands
what Dave must feel, for he
himself is undergoing the same
feeling. He informs Dave that
he is separated from Dave’s
mother and that he is in love
with someone else. He tells
Dave that although the first
love is very special, one has to
go beyond it and experience
life.

The movie is directed by
Franco Zeferelli. Zeferelli
chose to film all of the love-
making scenes between Jade
and David in either red or blue
gels. Why he does this I don’t
quite understand, unless it is to
demonstrate the dream-like
quality of the love that the two
are experiencing. The film also
is edited badly, and sometimes
lacks cohesion.

Endless Love is a movie that
simply doesn’t make it. This is
not due to poor acting. The
movie lost out because of a poor
script which could not come toa
sufficient stopping place. None-
theless, I could feel a certain
electricity between Hewitt and
Shields, a sort of believable
feeling of love. I think it is possi-
ble that they could team up
together again with excellent
results. However, that movie
would have to have a better
script, and better direction,
than Endless Love.

Classic Japanese Films Shown

by Carren O. Kaston

A rare opportunity to learn
more about Japanese life and
culture will become available to
Lexington residents this fall
when Washington & Lee Univer-
sity launches a series of five
Japanese feature films, begin-
ning on Monday, October 12.
The movies will be shown free
of charge on consecutive Mon-
days at 8 p.m., to enable all in-
terested members of the school
and local communities to at-
tend.

The films are being made
available through the generosi-

ty of The Japan Foundation.
They are based on major twen-
tieth century Japanese novels,
and will be shown in conjunc-
tion with Comparative Liter-
ature 221, ‘‘Japanese Literature
in Translation.’’ This is a course
taught jointly by Professors
Minor Rogers of the Religion
Department and John Evans of
the English Department. Pro-
fessor Carren Kaston of the
English Department has agreed
to share in the presentation of
the series because of her long-
standing interest in film.

The series begins on October

12 with The Heart (122
minutes), directed by Kon
Ichikawa in 1955. The movie is
based on Kokoro, a novel writ-
ten in 1914 by Natsume Soseki,
perhaps the greatest novelist of
Japan’s modern _ period.
Soseki’s subject is the impact
on the moral consciousness of
the Japanese of their transfor-
mation into a modern state and
society.

The movie is set at the end of
the Meiji era, the period of
Emperor Meiji’s” reign

(1868-1912), when Japan under-
went rapid modernization. An

intellectual named ‘‘Sensei”’
(teacher), who is seen through
the eyes of a young student,
finds himself alienated from
both traditional and modern
Japanese values. Through him,
Soseki presses his own am-
bivalent grief at the close of the
Meiji era, his feeling that
something irreplaceabie and
uniquely Japanese has been lost
in the process of modernization.
Soseki wrote Kokoro two years
after the death of the Emperor
Meiji, and two years before his
own death in 1916.

As in his other works, Soseki
is concerned in Kokoro with in-
dividualism and loneliness, a
theme which, before Soseki,
was not considered worthy of
attention among the Japanese,
whose society emphasizes com-
munal values. The intellectual
Sensei tries but fails to justify
his egoism in the face of tradi-
tional values. It has been said
that the best translation of the
Japanese word ‘‘kokoro”’ is that
of the Westerner Lafcadio
Hearn, who went to live in
Japan and became an inter-
preter of Japanese culture. His
translation is “the heart of
things.”

The director of The Heart,
Kon Ichikawa, is noted for his

‘superb sense of visual texture

and his concern with spiritually
abnormal behavior that charac-
terizes the social environment
of his protagonists. He is best
known in the West for the
luminous Harp of Burma
(1956); Conflagration (1958),
which will be shown fourth in
this series; and Fires on the
Plain (1959).

The second movie, scheduled
for October 19, is Okoto and
Sasuke (106 minutes), directed
in 1935 by Yasujiro Shimazu. It
is based on the Junichiro
Tanizaki novel Shunkinsho,
published in 1933.

The third movie, which is set
for October 26, is The Sound of
the Mountain (96 minutes),
1954 by Mikio
Naruse. Naruse’s movie is bas-
ed on the Yasunari Kawabata

_ novel Yama No Oto, published

in 1949.

Conflagration (96 minutes),
the fourth film, scheduled for
November 2, was directed by
Kon Ichikawa in 1958. It is bas-
ed on Yukio Mishima’s 1956
novel Kinkakuji (The Temple of
the Golden Pavilion).

The last film of the series will
be Hiroshi Teshigahara’s
Woman in the Dunes (150
minutes), scheduled for
November 9. This 1964 movie is
based on Kobo Abe’s 1962 novel
Suna No Onna.

Screenings will take place in
Lewis Hall “‘A,”’ with the excep-
tion of the screening of
Conflagration, which will take
place in duPont Hall. All of the
films are in the original
language with English sub-
titles. The novels on which these
films are based are available in
English translation.

“Japanese Literature in
Translation,”’ the course in con-

junction with which these films ,

will be shown, draws on Pro-
fessor Rogers’ commitment to
Japanese civilization, a par-
ticular, and Professor Evans’
commitment to literature, a
universal. Professor Rogers
first went to Japan when he was
in the army during the Korean
War. He subsequently spent
four years there as a mis-
sionary. Professor Evans’ in-
terest in Japan goes back to an
early enthusiasm for Japanese
porcelains and _ wood-block
prints. After Professor Evans

began to teach at Washington &
Lee, his interest was strength-
ened and broadened by his con-
tact with Professor Rogers.

Washington & Lee has been
selected by The Japan Founda-
tion as one of five schools to par-
ticipate in the program ‘“‘Twen-
tieth Century Japanese Liter-
ature Through Film.’ The other
participating schools are
Florida State University at Tal-
lahassee, Old Dominion Univer-
sity in Norfolk, University of
Tennessee at Knoxville, and
Purdue University at West
Lafayette, Indiana. The Japan
Foundation is a_ non-profit
organization founded by the
Japanese government in 1972 to
promote’ intellectual and
cultural exchange and mutual
understanding between Japan
and other countries.

Writing
Clinic
Offered

The English department has
announced the establishment of
a writing clinic, intended to help
any undergraduate whose writ-
ing seems deficient. The clinic
will be located in Payne 2B and
will be open from 7 until 10
o'clock each Tuesday and
Thursday night of the fall and
winter terms,

A senior English major will
be present to go over papers
that have been marked and re-
turned to students and to offer
help for improvement. He will
be prepared also to assist in the
preparation of papers not yet
submitted if the professors
assigning them have made
clear that such assistance is
permissible without violating
the Honor System.

The English department
regards the program as ex-
perimental and won't try to
predict what demand there will
be for it or what success it may
have. But if the clinic seems to
serve a useful purpose the de-
partment will attempt to con-
tinue it, and therefore it invites
you to send to it any student
whom you think it might help.

Weekend
Kickoff

by Bill Edmisten

A hard-driving rock n’ roll
band and thirty kegs of beer wil!
ignite the 1981 W&L Homecom-
ing celebrations at 9 p.m
tonight at Zollman’s Pavilion.

The band is Johnny Sportcoat
and the Casuals, a Charlottes-
ville-based group that features
a repertoire of rock, rhythm
and blues, and boogie music.
The rock selections span two
decades from the Beatles and
Yardbirds to the Grateful Dead,
Tom Petty and Elvis Costello.

The turn-out at the Pavilion is
expected to be large because
of extensive publicity and ad-
vance planning. Tom Gearen,
president of the Student Bar
Association, said that signs
have been posted at all of the
surrounding woman’s colleges,
and that he called the schools
several weeks ago in order to
minimize conflicts with other
events.

“This is the law school’s con-
tribution to Homecoming,”’ said
Gearen, referring to the plan-
ning and financing of the event
by the third year class. The Stu-
dent Activities Board nego-
tiated the contract with the
band, which is costing $900
Tickets will be required for ad-
mission and may be purchased
in advance through fraternities
or bought at the gate.

Myers Interview

(continued from page 1)

I think so. Besides the fact that it is amuch more
compact and concise document, without redun-
dancy found in the old book, there are certain
changes which allow the committee more freedom
and less fear of doing something illegal. For ex-
ample, changing the clause which says that the
statement read to the witnesses and to the accused
prior to their testimony, has to adhere to a sug-
gested format. In the old book it said that you
stated this. in quotes, to the witness. There was a
lot of fear that, gee, if we deviated from one word,
the entire proceeding is null and void. In trying to
revise the book, we tried to avoid the legalisms
which we thought permiated the old White Book,
because we're not a legal court and we have never
presumed to be a body or authority on law. This is
an honor system, not a legal system, and as such, I
think the new book has freed us of the fear of hav-
ing to face a legal system.

Do you have any specific goals for the E.C. or for
yourself as president for this school year?

I have a personal goal of trying to revise the con-
stitution, which I think is a must. It was a must
last year for Bob (Willis '81, last year’s president),
but it must be changed because student govern-
ment is clearly limited right now by a constitution

 

you. Having worked with and observed Willis in the
past, are there other ways in which you plan to follow
his example?

Bob has always been a very close friend of mine,
and in some ways he has served as a role model. I
think one way in which I'll differ from the way Bob
and his committee ran things is I want individual
committee members to play a larger role in per-
forming the E.C.’s duties. I felt that last year, Bob
took a lot on himself and sometimes really took the
committee for granted. That's not a fault, it’s just
the way that things were run in the past. Even the
letterhead on our Executive Committee belies the
attitude I have about how duties will be shared by
the committee members. We're all three up front;
there’s no vertical heirarchy. I want to depend on
Bennett (Ross, secretary) and Jim (Averett, vice
president) to help me out a lot this year; and I ex-
pect the ad hoc members to subcommittees to
keep on top of things. If this can all be accomplish-
ed I think that I can personally do more of what I
want to do, which is to go out and talk to people
and find out what people want and what they’re up
to; and to serve as kind of a liason between the
faculty and the students, and other students and
other students.

I think I’d like to decentralize things a little
more, is what I'd like to do.

“Last year there was a feeling that law students

didn’t want any interaction with undergraduates...

This year I’ve seen a different attitude on both sides...”

 

which is no longer in touch with what's going on. It
becomes increasingly difficult to conduct day-to-
day business with a document that, for instance,
was drawn up at a time when undergraduate and
law calendars were concurrent. At this point they
are no longer concurrent, and there are changes
which are needed due to the inflexibility of the old
document. We now have to cope with issues like
representation of law students, and other things
such as the treasurer, which we don’t have. The
treasurer’s Clause is not very useful to us. Revis-
ing the constitution is a topic which we’ll be ad-
dressing at length very soon.

Other goals of mine include trying to at least
socially unify law students and undergraduates.
Last year there was a feeling that law students
didn’t want any interaction with undergraduates,
and vice-versa. This year I’ve seen a different at-
titude on both sides, and I'd like to increase in-
teraction between the two groups.

Bob Willis was extremely interested in at least
establishing a dialogue with the two campuses, and
this is apparently an issue of particular concern to

Another question | had was if you expected E.C.
members to play a more active role in’ student
organizations this year.

Well, the whole idea behind having ad hoc
members to subcommittees is to have in effect our
own observers to find out what our subcommittees
are doing and how they’re doing it. Obviously if we
allocate the money and have control over the com-
mittees as per the constitution, then we should
know what’s going on, because these are student
body funds that are being spent. I think ad hoc
members will play a larger role this year than
they have in the past.

Does your job take up an inordinate amount of your
time, or is it about what you expected it to be?

Well, the actual work done in committee
meetings is about what I expected it to be. An
awful lot of time is taken up conferring with ad-
ministrators or faculty members who have ques-
tions, or just working around the office and keep-
ing up with things. I would have to say that it’s
about what I expected, which is a hell of a lot.

 

DOWN

Mary Baldwin College
Staunton, Va.

In assessing the strengths and
weaknesses of Mary Baldwin
College, here are a few facts.

For economical dating, Bald-
win takes a back seat only to
Southern Sem. Staunton is all of
a 30-mile drive from Lexington
— and a straight drive at that.
This makes getting to Baldwin
quick and uncomplicated,
though the ride back is inter-

| minably boring. Also, Staunton

plays guest host to the nearest
McDonald’s.

Unfortunately, there are
some negative aspects that
must be brought up.

The ride to Baldwin is simple,
but the ascent into the campus
parking lot, especially if one is
alcohol-induced and the roads
are icy, is not unlike scaling the
Matterhorn. The campus itself
is rather spread-out and some
of the buildings are unmarked.

As you will find at all girls’
schools, getting into the dorms
invokes hairy eye-balls and
bureaucratic red tape. The
dorms themselves are rather
nicely furnished. Baldwin is the

one can walk from one dorm to
another on heated sidewalks.

 

The heater’s effectiveness is
| debatable.

only school we know of where ~

THE ROAD:
Ever-Close Baldwin

Security itself is rather lax
compared to Sweet Briar or
Randolph-Macon. Staunton
police tend to place an em-
phasis on parking tickets and
beer smugglers. Campus secur-
ity is about the friendliest we
know. They’ll even shag on re-
quest.

Campus parties are centered
in the Student Activities Center,
also known as the Armory.

Minks beware.

The average Baldwin girl has
more than a fair chance to snag
an eligible male, as the school is
known to associate with both
VMI and that school in Charlot-
tesville. Sydney boys are also
known to make the trek to
Staunton.

Baldwin also gives minks a
wide scope of females. You'll
find the normal amount of
prepettes, along with a few
Joan Baez holdovers and others
who prefer to shag in female-
only groups.

The school itself does not en- |
joy 24-hour visitation rights due |
to a Staunton ordinance that |
would classify the school as a
red-light district if men could
come and go as they pleased.

All said, Baldwin is your
basic spur-of-the-moment road
trip for minks down Rte. 81. If
all fails, the Golden Arches are

only a few blocks away. |

Slippery Rock Proves Tricky For H2O Polo Team

Tim Rock battles past a Slippery Rock defender in their en-

counter on Saturday.

 

by G. Bruce Potter
The Washington & Lee water
polo Generals scored four wins
in the Slippery Rock tourna-

ment last weekend. Their fifth
game, however, was against

their nemesis, the host Rockets.

If you recall, Slippery Rock
downed the Generals two weeks
ago at the Fall Revue Classic,
13-5. It was closer this time,
however, as Slippery Rock held
on for a 10-8 victory and the
tournament title.

‘“‘We’ve improved more than
they (Slippery Rock) have in
two weeks. We felt good about
that loss, if you can feel good
about a loss,”’ said W&L coach
Page Remillard.

Slippery Rock took a four goal
lead into the locker room at
halftime but the Generals, now

13-10 Loss Drops Generals To 2-2

by Dale Park

Like a repeat performance of
last year’s 14-10 loss, the Wash-
ington & Lee football team
dropped a 13-10 decision to
ODAC rival Randolph-Macon
College on Day Field in Ash-
land, Virginia, last Saturday.

The loss lowered the Gener-
als’ overall record to 2-2 and
brought their ODAC mark to
1-1.

‘‘We just didn’t play physical-
ly tough football,” commented
head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘We
didn’t reach down and execute
like we should on offense and we
didn’t tackle well defensively.”’

The Yellow Jackets took a 7-0
lead two minutes into the game
as quarterback Andy Tate
scampered 30 yards for a touch-
down. W&L evened the score
late in the second period when
sophomore quarterback Al Par-
adise flipped a three-yard scor-
ing pass to junior slotback
Jerry Thompson.

The Generals actually took a
10-7 lead midway through the
third period on a 27-yard field
goal by junior Bill Devine. W&L
could only hold the advantage
until 10:44 of the final period,
however, as a 61-yard scoring
pass from Tate to wide-receiver
Chip Gupton put R-MC ahead
for good, 13-10.

As usual, the Generals relied
heavily on their two star offen-
sive players, Paradise and jun-
ior tailback Chris Cavalline. Ca-
valline carried the ball 30 times
for 100 yards while Paradise
completed 15 of 23 passes for 166
yards and one touchdown.

Once again, however, the
W&L defense proved vulnerable
to the long pass. In each of their
first four games, the Generals
have had one touchdown scored
against them on a pass of sixty
yards or more.

W&L’s defensive secondary,
maintained Fallon, is not en-
tirely to blame. ‘We haven’t
been stopping the other team’s
running as well as we should be.

Because of this, in a play-action
type situation, our secondary is
anxious about coming to sup-
port the defensive line and we
get beaten.”

What makes matters worse is
that next Saturday the Generals
will take on the most effective
passing team in the ODAC, the
Maryville Scots. In addition to
being the top passing team in
the league, Maryville is also the
leading team in rushing and
total offense. The Scots have
averaged almos. 36 points per
game so far this season while
running their record to 4-0.

Said Fallon: ‘Maryville is
definitely a big-play team. They
have a pair of fine quarter-
backs, two sets of powerful run-
ning backs, several outstanding
wide receivers and possibly the
largest defense we’ll see all
year. They have a young team
that might make mistakes
—and I hope they make a bun-
dle of them.”’

The game begins at 1:30 p.m.
on Wilson Field.

11-2 on the year, closed the gap
to two and had a chance to
make the game closer on a
counter-attack breakaway.
However, the Rockets’ goalie,
who was ‘‘very hot,’’ according
to Remillard, broke up the play
and threw the ball downpool
where three Rockets had sur-
rounded goalie Andy Gates. The
score gave Slippery Rock a
three goal lead that W&L was
never able to overcome.

The Generals will get another
chance for revenge in the
Bucknell Tournament in two
weeks. “‘I think Slippery Rock is
extremely concerned about us
getting by them now,” corn-
mented Remillard. ‘‘We have to
win that game.”’

In the meantime, however,
the Generals will compete in the
first half of the ten-team
Southern League Tournament
this weekend at Cy Twombly
Pool. The top four teams at the
conclusion of the second-half, to

be played in Richmond, Oct
23-25; will advance to the
Southern League champion-
ships.

“We are extremely pleased
with our defense. It’s catching
up to our offense now. We’re
creating more turnovers and
getting more and more shots a
game,” explained Remillard.
However, the team only con-
verted on one of 11 power play
opportunities against Slippery
Rock.

All-American Tim Rock was,
according to Remillard, ‘‘a con-
sistently intimidating force
throughout the tournament.”
Junior Eric Peterson tallied 27
times in the five games for the
Generals. Senior Mike Bernot
added 11 goals and sophomore
Rand McClain scored nine.

In its other games, W&L beat
the Pittsburgh Water Polo Club
15-13, the Slippery Rock ‘‘B”
team 13-2, West Virginia 19-4
and Indiana (Pa.) College 13-7.

Packed Roanoke Forces Harriers Into Second

by Rick Swagler

The Washington & Lee cross-
country was narrowly defeated
this past Saturday in a tri-meet
held at Roanoke College. The
team results were fairly close,
with Roanoke finishing first
with 37 points, W&L second with
42 and Norfolk State in third
with 50 points. Next week, the
Generals will travel to Lynch-
burg to take on Lynchburg Col-
lege and Emory & Henry.

For W&L, the battle between
freshman Frank Pittman and
Angus McBryde, a sophomore,
continues. Last week, Pittman
edged McBryde to win the meet
against Mary Washington and
Washington College.

This week it was a different
story. McBryde finished second
over-all and first for W&L with
a time of 29:36. Pittman was

close behind with a third overall
placing and a 29:50 time.

Jon Kelefant moved into the
Generals’ top five with a
seventh place finish and a time
of 30:34. This top five finish,
remember, was predicted by
Paul Chapman last week. Chris
Smith finished fourth for W&L
and 16th overall turning in a
time of 31:52. Paul Chapman
rounded out the W&L top five
with an 18th place finish and a
time of 32:07.

Steve Whetzle, a freshman,
led the race for two miles before
getting a “‘stitch’’ (the same
problem Kelefant had last
week) and was forced to drop
back.

Chapman commented that
the reason Roanoke did so well
was ‘‘they ran in a pack and the
big gap between our third and

 

Bill Devine, the Generals
place kicker, is quickly ap-
proaching the field goal career
record at W&L. Devine con-
nected on a 27-yard field goal
Saturday to give him 12 career
FG's and tie the General mark
in that category. A junior,
Devine is three-for-seven this
season.

fourth finishers hurt us a lot.”
The strategy of running in a
pack was one of the reasons for
W&L’s success last week.

Pittman said that ‘if Whetzle
had finished where he should
have, we could have claimed
Roanoke.”’ Pittman added, ‘‘We
knew we would have a tough
race.”’

McBryde, when asked about
the continuing battle between
Pittman and himself, said
“Pittman and I will have a con-

stant battle which will help us
both and will help the team.””

The times this week were
more than a minute slower than
times recorded in a time trial on
W&L’s course. Coach Miller,
when asked about the dis-
crepancy, commented ‘I think
the (Roanoke) course is long.
It’s faster than ours, but the
times were a minute-plus off.
Their course is probably closer
to 5-1/4 miles. That’s no excuse

for our performance, though.
We all ranon the same course.”’

About the course, Miller said
that ‘‘quite a bit of it was on
pavement and I’m to blame for
(the team) not liking pavement.
We don’t run much on the road
because in the long run, it’s
harder on the legs.”

As Frank Pittman observed,
“I’ve never seen a coach care
for ateam so much.”’

Unlucky Booters Fall To mompeters

by John Harrison

With two closely matched
rivals pitted against each other,
Hampden-Sydney College need-
ed a couple of fluke plays to
escape with a 3-2 victory over
the Washington and Lee soccer
team this past Tuesday.

Both teams had an equal
number of opportunities to
score early in the opening
minutes. It wasn’t until the mid-
dle of the first half that the
Generals got their first hint that
luck would be working against
them.

It began when freshman
keeper John Gindhart, making
his first start of the season,
made an exceptional save by
getting in front of a wicket shot
from point-blank range. The
momentum of the H-SC forward
who took the shot carried him
toward the goal, allowing him to
get just enough on the rebound
that it was able to squib past
Gindhart and into the goal.

W&L tied it at one when
junior Jerry Moyer connected
on a ten-yarder with two
minutes remaining in the first
half. Moyer went on to lead the
Generals’ attack that came ex-
tremely close on several occa-
sions to producing the goal
which would have made the
final 3-3.

Hampden-Sydney took the
lead for the second time mid-
way through the second half as
a result of the first freak play
that gave the Tigers a goal. The
play developed when a H-SC
midfielder lifted a seemingly
harmless shot from forty yards
out to Kirk Mancer, who replac-
ed Gindhart in goal to start the
second half. Before anyone had
time to react, a forward caught
up with the lob and leaped to
head it over Mancer’s shoulder.

The Generals tied the score
for the second and final time as

463-9152

 

ei

a result of forward Brad Poor-
man’s pressure that kept the
ball in the Tigers’ end. His
centering pass from the right
corner got lost in a scramble in
front of the goal. When the ball
was finally jarred loose, junior
Tom Elder was left uncontested
for a 5-footer.

Just a minute and a half later
Hampden-Sydney notched the
game winner on its second fluke
of the day. The play unfolded
when Mancer could not get con-
trol of a weak shot taken from

an angle. This created a wild

scramble in the goal mouth,
with the ball bouncing around in
front of the partially screened
keeper. Before Mancer could
spot the ball, it had trickled just
inches over the goal line.

The loss dropped W&L to .500
(3-3) for the first time this
season. It also put Hampden-
Sydney (3-1) ahead of the
Generals (2-1) in the O.D.A.C.
standings.
