Dorm Renovation
Progressing Well

by Ben Jarratt

The renovation of Graham-Lees dormitory is
progressing very well according to Douglas E.
Brady, Plant Projects Manager of Washington
and Lee University.

Brady said the project is on schedule and‘should
be complete in time for the beginning of classes in
September 1982. The renovation began at the end
of school last June.

The basic intent of the $2.7 million job was to
bring the dormitory up to the standards of the pre-
sent fire codes. Brady explained that Graham-
Lees was remodeled in 1941 and the building met
the fire codes then. Since that time, however,
codes changed, plumbing deteriorated, and doors
and trimming needed to be replaced.

According to Brady, several stages of work are
progressing. Structual repairs need to be com-
pleted before electricians, plumbers and
carpenters began their various tasks. After the in-
itial repair work is completed, the walls can be
replastered, painted and floor tile can be laid
down.

The work on Graham-Lees is progressing from
the top floor down to the bottom level. Brady said
this process allows for one group to begin work on
' one floor, while others are finishing work on
another floor.

Hotel Living Has

Only A Few Flaws

by Rob Schlegel

While some unlucky W&L freshmen are trying
to adjust to their tiny living quarters on campus in

Gilliam Dorm, it seems that the 90 or so freshmen
residing in the Robert E. Lee Hotel are quite
satisfied with their living conditions in downtown
Lexington.

There are only. a few complaints from the
students. These include the rather slow elevator
and the problem of people pulling the fire alarms.
No one knows for sure who has been pulling the
alarms, although some students believe the
culprits are townies.

The major complaint, however, concerns the
hotel parking lot behind the building. Dorm
counselors and freshmen aren’t permitted to park
their cars there.

According to one freshman resident, Craig
Narins, the parking lot is almost always empty.
Said Narins, ‘‘We’re residing at the hotel and it
(the parking lot) is for people using the hotel.”” He
noted that it’s even a longer walk to the freshman
parking lot from the hotel than it is from campus.

Narins remarked that some students are think-
ing of circulating a petition to protest the issue.
Another freshman who is upset about the parking
lot, Charlie Martin, said, “I think it’s really cheap
that we’re not allowed to park out there.”’

society should expect of jour-

Dr. Hodges characterizes the

man Isaacs, chairman of the
National News Council, who
will deliver a public lecture
tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the

weekend in what promises to be
an intense three-day seminar.
The institute is coordinated
each year by Dr. Louis Hodges
and features a highly-respected
assembly of journalists discuss-
ing issues involving the ethics of
the profession. For the first
time, the gathering will con-
template a central theme:

sessions as being ‘“‘useful for
both the faculty and the student
body.’’ The annual event is ap-
parently better known outside
the W&L community than with-
in, and this year it features
some of the most prestigious
journalists in this country.
Leading the discussion during
the first two days will be Nor-

University Library’s Northen
Auditorium. He will speak on
press responsibility.

Other notables scheduled to
attend include: Fred Behringer
of the Montgomery Publishing

FRESHMEN HOUSING Six Houses Given

Social Probation

by Steve Perry

Six fraternities were given
one week of social probation for
failing their house inspections.
Beta Theta Pi, Delta Tau Delta,
Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Nu,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Phi
Gamma Delta were all given
the opportunity to appeal their
convictions to the Student Af-
fairs Committee. If the frater-
nities decide to appeal their
cases, their sentences will be
held on obeyance until after
SAC reviews the cases.

Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Hall Vetterlein expressed
concern over the lack of
coverage given to the positive
contributions of fraternities to
the W&L commnuity. The IFC
elected Bill Mooney and Jim
Hess Chairmen of an IFC
publicity committee.

Following the regular
meeting, three fraternities
were brought before the IFC

Judicial Board. Beta Theta Pi ~

was summoned for an incident

which occured Saturday night.
At approximately midnight

on Saturday, six Beta’s torched

Square, approximately 20 feet
from the Beta house. The Lex-
ington Fire Department
responded to the incident by
sending an ambulance and
several fire trucks. The firemen
subsequently complained to
Dean Of Fraternties Dan Mur-
phy that they were heckled by
the students. Dean Murphy
stated that one fireman was hit
by a bottle and several others
were doused with beer.

The Beta’s defended their ac-
tions by stating that the fireman

had deliberately turned their
hoses on the students. Beta
President Mark Robson staed
that ‘‘the aggravation was not
one party’s fault.’”” Robson add-
ed that the people involved were
not participating in a Beta func-
tion and that ‘‘a bad precedent
is set when a fraternity is held
responsible for the actions of in-
dividual members.”

The IFC was unanimously
convinced that since Betas were
involved and house furniture
was burned, the house could be
held responsible for the fire.
The Betas were given one week
of social probation and a fine of
$150. In addition, the Betas will
be required to write a letter of
apology to the Lexington
Volunteer Fire Department.

In other matters, Sigma Nu
was given two weeks of social
probation and Phi Kappa Sigma
conduct probation following a
bottle-throwing incident that oc-
cured last Wednesday night.

Taps sounded at Virginia Military Institute at
11:35.

“That’s the best sound,”’ said one cadet.

“§--t,” said another.

The two Ring Tum Phi reporters pulled off the
robes they had used to ‘‘sneak”’ into the Barracks.
It had taken weeks to set up this meeting inside the
dorms of VMI.

A loud crack sounded at the door causing one of
the Phi’s reporters to start and whirl around. The
cadets laughed.

‘“‘When the captain’s gun hits the door, you have
to be alright,’’ said one cadet. ‘‘ ‘Alright’ means
not in a fraternity house,’ and wherever you’re
supposed to be. Getting caught in a fraternity,
they told us, means six weeks on confinement.
| A cadet covered the window with a black

blanket. ‘‘State of the art,’”’ he said. Another went
to the sink and relieved himself with the water

 

running. He said it was the custom of freshman
“rats” who are required to dress fully in order to
walk to the bathrooms.

The six cadets that gathered, however, were up-
perclassmen. The rooms contained five beds.
Uniforms hung on open rods. The cadets had been
given permission to hang three posters(VMI foot-
ball calenders). After inspection, however, the
shades were pulled down and Playboy pinups
revealed.

The discussion began about freshman life.
“Rats” cannot be touched, or their mothers bad-
mouthed, since hazing is a federal offense.
However, the ‘“‘rat’’ soon learns to put up with
shouting, sweat parties of push-ups and sit-ups ina
steamy shower room, and the chin-in, chest-out
“strain’’ at attention and on the “‘rat line’’ which
delineates where rats may walk in the barracks.

“Tf you’re a rat, you don’t know what’s up,”’ said
one cadet’ Another related how a freshman in-
sulted him on the orders of another up-

by John Wells

| A trouble-ridden Sigma Nu
| fraternity is hoping for substan-
tial assistance from alumni to
‘help ease its current financial

woes. The key to the problem,
according to house president
Bill Dederick, lies in the en-

thusiastic participation of
chapter members.

|

| Since being evicted from their
| house, the chapter has lost a
| significant amount of income
from rents no longer paid by 17
‘to 20 members who would or-

dinarily live there. In addition,
‘it has debts totalling around
| $7000 in Lexington, including a
| whopping $2000 owed to Kro-
|ger’s. Sigma Nu’s_ national

| headquarters, located here in

| town, is unable to help with this

| problem due to a by-law which

stipulates it cannot pay for
debts incurred in town.

With a mortgage payment
due in December which could
determine whether the chapter
lives or dies, Dederick and
others are attempting to shore

_ up support. Alumni are report-

edly raising funds to bail out the
house, but Dederick does not
think that such a contribution
will be made until some frater-
‘nity members develop a
| positive consensus to get SNU

back on its feet. There are cur-
rently sbout 35 members of the
fraternity, but only 20 to 25 at-
tend meetings regularly, accor-

ding to the president. He ex-
pressed pleasure at a rush snag
of “eight or nine’’ pledges this
year.

The crisis atmosphere sur-
rounding the fraternity has
resulted in at least one rather
bizarre series of occurances.
The house itself is still used for

meetings and social events, and
a party featuring a reggae band
was planned for last Wednes-
day. Before the party, rumors

spread that the house chapter
had been revoked, and that the
party would be the scene of
mass destruction: a sledgeham-
mer party.

Administration officials got
wind of the party and Dean of
Students Lewis John telephoned
SNU Vice President Chris

Stokes to inform him that if the
frat disbanded and was physi-
cally destroyed, the university
would pursue _ individual

students for damages. The par-
ty turned out to be a non-violent
in nature, with the exception of
a bottle throwing incident in-

volving neighboring Phi Kappa
Sigma, which resulted in a few
broken windows, according to
Dederick.

So the future of the house re-
mains uncertain at this point.
The financial wounds are deep,
going back to years of unpaid
dues and some house treasurers

Hill Special Guest On
Chinese Relations Show

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity professor Harold Hill will
be a special guest on a televi-
sion show examining the United
States’ developing relations
with the People’s Republic of
China.

The show, which is part of a
series entitled “World Perspec-
tives,”’ will be aired at 9 p.m.,
Fri., Nov. 6 over Roanoke’s
public television station,
WBRA-TV (Channel 15).

Hill is associate professor of
German at W&L. His teaching
responsibilities include German
language and literature, Chi-
nese language and literature,
and Russian language. He was
formerly the director of the
university’s East Asian Studies
Program and conducts W&L’s

Mandarin summer school in
Taiwan.

Hill and William F. Rope,
director of the Office of Chinese
Affairs in the U.S. State Depart-
ment, will be the featured
guests on the ‘‘World Perspec-
tive” show. They will be ques-
tioned by a panel comprised of
Dr. Richard Smith of Ferrum
College, Henry Cox, retired
career foreign. service officer,
and Geoff Seamons, editorial
writer for the Roanoke Times &
World-News.

The television series is funded
by the Virginia Foundation for
the Humanities and Public
Policy, and its aim is to present
a complex issue in foreign
policy in simplified terms for
the average viewer.

who have been less than strict.

On the positive side, Dederick
says that all the house’s utilities
are paid up, and the dwelling

itself is cosmetically, if not
structurally sound following a
spruce-up after last week’s par-

ty. Dederick says that Mo Lit-
tlefield, executive director at
national headquarters, is ac-

tively interested in “turning
SNU around.”’ His efforts, and
an alumni contribution that

would be a shot in the arm the
chapter so desperately needs,
will be determined by a more

positive effort on the part of the
fraternity members as a whole.

Probably the most pressing
concern for the Sigma Nu
fraternity, now struggling to re-
main open on the Washington
and Lee campus, is_ the
numerous financial obligations
the chapter has to both the
university and local merchants.

The house owes approximate-
ly $25,000 in mortgage
payments to the university and
approximately $7000 to local
merchants.

According to one official con-
nected with the Sigma Nu
organization, Dan Rodriguez,
the fraternity is willing to help
the local chapter pay its debts

Law Conference On Bankruptcy

Lawyers and judges
specializing in consumer
bankruptcy cases participated
in a one-day conference at the
Frances Lewis Law Center in

Washington and Lee Universi-
ty’s School of Law last week.
The participants, including
U.S. Rep. M. Caldwell Butler,
discussed problems currently

involved in consumer bankrupt-
cy cases under the Bankruptcy
Reform Act of 1979.

One of the major problems
many lawyers and judges have
identified with the new act in-
volves the increased cost of fil-
ing.

Joseph Ulrich, professor of
law at W&L, organized and
directed the conference, which

included 21 lawyers and judges
from Virginia and the District
of Columbia.

According to Frederic L.
Kirgis Jr., director of the
Frances Lewis Law Center, the
touse Judiciary Committee
plans to publish the proceedings
from the conference as a com-
mittee print.

SNU Continues To Labor Under Financial Burden

 

The Signa Nu house in disrepair and in debt.

SNU Owes $7000 To Merchants

to the university. The national
chapter is hesistant, however,
to underwrite the debts of the
local chapter to local mer-

chants. According’ to
Rodriguez, ‘‘You can’t expect
any fraternity. (to pay for debts)
accumulated by a _ chapter
through mismanagement. A
chapter is expected to set a
budget and keep within the
limits of that budget.”’
According to a person con-
nected with one of the local
firms that SNU owes money to,
“The chapter fell behind last
Spring and hasn’t paid a thing
this fall.’’ A spokesman for Na-
tional Wholesaler pointed out

that many fraternities only pay
a small amount of their balance -
each month, depending on how
responsible the house officers
are.

According to an official at
Kroger’s, Snu is making an ef-

fort to clear its debt at that |

store. National Wholesaler add-
ed that it has contacted the
chapter’s national organization,
located in Lexington, about the
debt.

The Executive Director of
Sigma Nu, Mo Littlefield, will
meet with Deans Lewis John
and Dan Murphy next week to
discuss the future of the chapter
at W&L.

‘Tuesday In The Pit’
gets Strong Feedback

by Gregory A. Coy

Washington and Lee’s
Cockpit and the University
Center Committee have provid-
ed a new twist for student enter-
tainment.

The twist. is
‘“‘Tuesdays.’’

Bob Schmidt originally pro-
moted the idea. ‘‘We are trying
to establish a_ tradition,
whereby every Tuesday night, a
student can expect some good
entertainment in the Cockpit.”
Schmidt also indicated that
“Tuesdays’’ can provide the
students with an option from the
fraternity parties and the local
bars.

“The E.C. gave enough
money for us to book a few
mediocre bands without charg-
ing the student body. By charg-
ing the students admission, a
double tax, we can get better
bands and more of them,’’ said
Schmidt.

“We try to get bands from the
area, with a good name, who
will draw a crowd, and give a
good show.”’

‘Although some of the bands
are expensive, some of them
usually cost $3.50 per person in
another bar, and that would be
for just one set,’’ according to

called

Schmidt.

Schmidt stressed that
“Tuesdays”’ is non-profit, and
that any surplus goes back into
the UCC. He added that
‘“‘Tuesdays’’ will continue
through the winter term.

“So far the feedback has been
positive, although we are open
to suggestions,” said Schmidt.
Tuesday night bands in the
Cockpit were endangered last
week when the management of
the Cockpit and the Committee
wrangled among themselves
about the closing time on
Tuesdays.

Jerry Darrell, who runs the
dining hall, the co-op and the
Cockpit, considered 1:30 a.m.
an unreasonably late closing
time. Student managers and
workers would be kept until
almost 3:00 a.m. cleaning up,
according to Doug Linton, stu-
dent manager.

The Committee considered
midnight too early to pack up
the band, and threatened to
take ‘“Tuesdays’’ to Zollman’s
Pavillion, about five miles
southwest of town.

A compromise of 12:30 a.m.
was reached.

----Todd Smith added to
this report.

Evidence of the Southern
gentleman stereotype at
Washington and Lee University
once again prevails. In the
tradition of the 19th century
riverboat gamblers who risked
money, slaves, and even planta-
tions on the flip of a ecard,
students nave turned to casual
gambling as a source of enter-
tainment, though for much
smailer stakes.

cards are common in the
freshmen dorms, fraternity
houses and other areas of cam-
pus. The way they work is sim-
ole. In each game, a favorite

the projected margin of victory
is given.

If the bettor thinks the
favorite will win by more than
the ‘‘spread,”’ he chooses the
favorite. On the other hand, if
he feels the favorite will fail to

Hale, the ad hoe E.C. member
of the symposium, aiso felt that
there was no need to name a
chairman on Monday.

He recommended looking for
a well-qualified member on the
faculty or from the Law School.

Secretary Bennett Ross and
Vice President Jim Averett
argued that time was running
out, Ross said that the meeting
was weil-advertised and that
those who did not come should
not be considered. ~

The chairmanship question
was not resolved.

Hale explained ‘o the Com-
mittee that he had sent out let-
ters about the Symposium to the
faculty. “If you think they went
out late—well, f don’t.’

Winnings are based on the
number of games chosen. Odds
start at three games, at which
they are 6 to 1, and go to ten
games, at which point they are
750 to 1.

This means if the bettor
chooses three teams and bets
$i, he will win $6 if all three
teams win.

Cards are usually distributed
by a member of the custodial
staff who wished to remain
anonymous. He estimated that
he passes out adoui 190 cards a
week and receives 75 percent
back with bets. ‘Usually there
aren't many Winners here, but I
hear about them in other

The making, placing or receipt,
of any bet or wager in this State of
‘money or other things of value,
dependent upon the resuit of any
game, contest, or any other event
the outcome of which is uncertain
or a matter of chance, whether
such game, contest or event, oc-
curs or is to occur inside or out-
side the limits of this State, shall
constitute illegal gambling.

He added that sections
18,2-326 and 328 designate bet-
ting as a Class 3 misdemeanor
and operating a gambling
enterprise or activity as a Class
6 felony.

Dean Robert Huntley said the
university’s _stand.. was.- less
severe. ‘‘We won’t start

legislating something of such
minutia,” he said.

Huntley quoted Queen
Elizabeth, who said when ad-
visers wanted her to enforce
laws requiring attendance at
the Anglican Church, “‘I desire
a window into no man’s soul.”’

Japanese Series Finishes Up

by Carren O. Kaston
Washington and Lee Univer-
ity’s series of Japaneses films

concludes this Monday, Novem- _

ber 9, with the widely acclaim-
ed Woman in the Dunes (132
minutes). The series returns to
classroom ‘A’’ of Lewis Hall
for this last movie, which will
be screened at 8 P.M., free of
charge.

The most recent of the five
films shown in the series,
Woman in the Dunes was
directed by Hiroshi
Teshigahara in 1964. It was
nominated in that year for an
Academy Award as_ Best
Foreign Film, and won the
Special Jury Prize at the Can-

German
Movie
Shown

by Carren O. Kaston

The Film Society’s second
movie this season is Reinhard
Hauff’s superb psychological
mystery-thriller Knife in the
Head (Germany, 1978: 108
minutes). It will be shown Fri-
day and Saturday, November 6
and 7, at 8 P.M. in classroom
‘A’? of Lewis Hall, free of
charge.

Hauff is one of a second wave
of directors to emerge from the
West German film renaissance
that began in the 70’s. The first
wave includes Werner Herzog,
Rainer Werner Fassbinder, and
Wim Wenders, whose films
have appeared in earlier Film
Society series.

Hauff’s hero in Knife in the
Head is a biogeneticist who is
shot in the head while looking
for his wife at the headquarters
of a radical political group. Ex-
tensive brain damage impairs
his speech and memory.
Despite its title, Knife in the
itead is violent mainly in terms
of. suspense: the demands it

nes Film Festival. Teshi-
gahara’s film is based on the
1960 novel Suna No Onna , which
won for its author Kobo Abe the
Yomiuri Prize for Literature in
Japan.

The plot concerns the stay at
a desolate village amidst the
dunes of a young vacationing
entymologist, or insect
specialist. The villagers have
persuaded him to help a widow
who lives in a sand and whose
task is daily ta. shovel her house
free of the sand. This sand is
then hauled up and away by

rope, and she is brought food in
turn. She never leaves the pit,
and the man soon discovers, to
his alarm, that he cannot either.
Eventually, he becomes the
woman’s lover as well as her
helper. When he has a chance
some time later to escape, he
does not take it.

The trapped teacher-scientist
is played by Eiji Okada, who
gave so memorable a perfor-
mance in Alain Resnais’ Hiro-
shima Mon Amour
(France/Japan, 1959).

Bishop Here Tuesday

Elvin Bishop. was born in
Tulsa, Oklahoma and grew up
on a farm with hogs and
chickens; unlikely beginnings
for a musician whose career
has encompassed a variety of
musical styles and taken him on
many tours across the country.

In the early 60’s, Elvin earned
a National Merit Scholarship,
which gave him a ticket out of
Oklahoma. He chose the
University of Chicago, and
headed up north, where, on his
first day of college, he ran intoa
young blues harmonica player
named Paul Butterfield. The 18-
year old Bishop had not played
an instrument at this point, but
his meeting with Butterfield in-
spired him to get a guitar.
These were the beginnings of
Elvin’s off-campus studies in
Chicago’s South Side Blues
clubs, where he, Paul, and their
friend, Michael Bloomfield,
were the only white kids spunky
enough to sit in with the veteran
black Blues musicians. The
Paul Butterfield Blues ‘Band
evolved from these jam ses-
sions. Later, Elvin continued to
influence the course of
American music history by for-
ming his own band, The Elvin
Bishop Group, building his own
prolific career.

By this time, Bishop had
migrated to San Francisco, just
in time for the late sixties,
where he landed his first recor-
ding contract with ‘Bill
Graham’s Fillmore Records, a
subsidiary of Columbia. His
first album was The Elvin
Bishop Group, in 1969, followed
by Feel It. Elvin continued to
develop as a performer and
musician, and by his third
album, for Epic records, Rock
My Soul (1973), he had evolved
a style of his own, a good-time
mixture of rock and roll,
rhythm and blues, country, sw-
ing, and dance music, along
with some pretty gospel-type
vocal parts and tight in-
strumental lines. A meeting
with The Allman Brothers’
Dicky Betts resulted in a con-
tract with Capricorn Records,
and a renewal of Elvin’s roots in
the South. His 1974 album, Let It
Flow came at the height of the
Southern Rock Movement, ad-
ding another dimension to
Elvin’s unique musical blend.
His exposure as a good-rockin’
performer and recording artist

grew through Juke Joint Jump.

and then Elvin Bishop exploded
in 1976 with Struttin’ My Stuff,
which spawned the smash gold

single ‘‘Fooled Around and Fell

exterior shots were taken on the VMI campus but most of it was
made in Hollywood. This is reasonably entertaining stuff, of
primary interest for obvious local reasons and the fact that it was
an early hit for a young contract-player named Ronald Reagan.
The rest of the cast includes a young Eddie Albert, Priscilla Lane, a
mousey: Jane-Wyman;- who would be the first Mrs. Reagan, and
Louise Beavers. Ronnie is an aw-shucksy veemee. Presented by

Elvin Bishop: A Man For Good-Rockin’ Fans

(continued from page 4)
in Love;”’ the sentimental, pret-
ty ballad won him a new follow-
ing in addition to his good-
rockin’ fans.

The logical follow-up was
Hometown Boy Makes Good,
and then the 1977 live double
album Raisin’ Hell, a cross-
section of Elvin’s best tunes to

   
   

Automatt in San Francisco, it
features some of the Bay Area’s
finest musicians, including
Maria Muldaur on vocals, noted
guitarist Amos Garrett, Phil
Aaberg on keyboards, and the
rest of Elvin’s excellent road
band. Commenting on Hog
Heaven, Elvin said, ‘‘A few of
the tunes are more smoothly

that point. This is a great con-
cert LP, capturing the excite-
ment and humor of Elvin’s live
performances; Elvin has a
reputation for getting even the
most laid-back audience to
jump out of their seats and
boogie. The band is renowned
for its tightness and crisp, well-
executed solos from each
player; Elvin has assembled
various combinations of top-
notch musicians who really look
like they’re enjoying
themselves onstage. Elvin
himself has a comic presence
with his frizzy hair, expressive
face, and a wit that pervades
the atmosphere with a light-
heartedness; however, when he
steps up to play lead licks on his
guitar one hears the precision
work of a great guitar player, a
man who is determined to bring
quality to his audience. This
combination of humor: with a
tight band, excellent playing,
and a variety of styles all infus-

produced, but several come
under a_ ‘back-to-basics’
category for me. It’s an effort
on my part to broaden a little
bit. You know, I have an
‘automatic quality control’ in
my head and it was used a lot

ae

during the sessions. As a goal, I
try to shoot for the kinds of
things that Stevie Wonder and
Ray Charles have done; they
make music that is hailed by
other musicians and ap-
preciated by the public, too.
Some of the material, Elvin
notes, ‘has been around for
awhile, just like ‘Fooled Around
and Fell in Love’ had been, and
wen some of it’s brand new.”
He continues, ‘I think it’s the
best-sounding record I’ve ever
done. It’s just what I wanted out
of each track...and everyone
concerned is very proud of the
end result... knew what I
wanted, and the key to my ap-
proach was to surround myself
with people who knew exactly
what they were doing.
Everyone appearing on the
album is a seasoned player.
Also, I didn’t use strictly
regimented tunes. Instead, I
would go in the studio with just
fragments, teach the players a
chord or two to get the basic
idea across, and they usually
took it from there. So the musi-
cians were able to use a lot of
their personal ideas, and take a
more active role in each song.”
We can expect another new
album from Elvin Bishop in late
1979, in the process of being
recorded right now. As Elvin’s
artistry has continually
matured on each consecutive
album, including his growth as
a songwriter, this is definitely
an album to watch out for. He is
one of the few artists in modern
American music history to con-
stantly explore new musical
territory and at the same time,
retain his own style of playing
and living without resting on the
laurels of a hit song. There is a
certain honesty and integrity
about an artist who, after pro-
ducing a gold single and many
notable albums, bought some
land in Marin County and finds
joy in his garden, his hogs (pic-
tured on the cover of Hog
Heaven), his chickens, and a

oe" MEMOREX

return to the country life of his
youth.

Elvin Bishop has seen a lot of
the world, but his music is still
rooted in an earthy light-
heartedness, for real people and
real life.

Editor’s Note: Elvin Bishop will
be appearing with Johnny Sport-
coat, Tues., Nov. 10, in the
Cockpit. Admission for the show
will be $4.

Members of the Washington & Lee Water Polo team during their
Virginia State Championship game.

Polo Sets Win Mark,
Takes Va. State Title

by G. Bruce Potter

“Amen.” '

So said Page Remillard, head
coach of the Washington and
Lee water polo team, after his
squad soundly defeated five op-
ponents, including the Universi-
ty of Richmond, to capture the
Virginia State Championships
last weekend.

The Generals will now come
home for the Southern League
Championships, a_ two-day,
four-team double-elimination
tournament, this weekend at Cy
Twombly pool.

W&L downed the University
of Virginia, 27-3, the University
of Richmond ‘B’’ team, 11-2,
Lynchburg College, 10-3, Hamp-
den-Sydney, 5-0 (by forfeit),

~and, in what proved to be the
championship game of the
round robin event, the Universi-
ty of Richmond, 10-3.

“We put it all together
against Richmond,”’ said Re-
millard. ‘I was more nervous
before the game started than
the players.” The Generals

boosted their record to 26-4 and,
in the process, set a school
record for most wins by a team
in any sport in one season.

Remillard said that his squad
is ‘‘more structured, more dis-
ciplined and in better shape’
than the University of Rich-
mond. In addition, he was pleas-
ed because the team had never
really previously taken charge
of key games.

The four losses suffered by
the Generals this season came
as a result of not converting the
opponent’s turnovers, explain-
ed Remillard. Against Rich-
mond, however, the Generals
capitalized on their turnovers
even though both teams had ap-
proximately the same number.

Goalie Andy Gates stopped 12
of 15 shots and had two assists :
and junior Ken Johnstone
scored three goals to pace the
Generals against Richmond. In
addition, sophomore Rand Mc-
Clain took seven shots for the
tourney and made all seven,
and junior co-captain Erik

Peterson hit 59 percent of his
Shots despite forcing some
shots, according to Remillard.
Bobby Pearson and Matt
Ravencraft were “outstanding
off the bench,’’ said the third-
year coach.

Overall, the Generals outshot
their opponents 55 percent to 24
percent &nd outscored them
58-11 in the four games (not in-
cluding Hampden-Sydney’s for-
feit). Remillard is still not
pleased with the team’s six-on-
five (power play) offense,
however, they managed to con-
vert on 52 percent of their op-
portunities last weekend, but
Remillard will be putting some
emphasis on that aspect of the
Generals’ game this week in
practice. “‘We’re forcing shots
instead of taking advantage of
the defense,’ he said.

The teams that will be com-
peting this weekend other than
W&L areas follows:

James Madison University
—the Generals’ opening round
opponent (9:30 a.m., Sat., Nov.
7), represented the Southern
League at the Division II
Eastern Tournament last
season.

Duke University — beset by
injuries of late but a “‘disciplin-
ed and motivated team,”’ accor-
ding to Remillard. They
defeated both Richmond and
W&L in 1980.

University of Richmond
—defending Southern League
Champions must open the
tourney against Duke. They
should be hungry for revenge,
however, having lost to the
Generals two weeks ina row.

Should the Generals have pro-
blems winning this weekend’s
Southern League Champion-
ship, then, says Remillard, they
can forget about pulling any
upsets at the Eastern Cham-
pionships the following week-
end, to which the Southern

~ League champion will advance.

However, if they sweep their
competition, Remillard advises

_ that the teams in the Easterns

had better ‘‘beware.’’

Remillard concluded, ‘‘If
we’re worth our salt, we should
be able to handle this tourna-
ment the way we did the one
last weekend.”

 

Harriers Win 2 Of 3
In ODAC Tune-up

by Rick Swagler
They say two out of three ain’t

bad, and the W&L cross-country

team found this to be the case

last weekend in a meet against
Lynchburg College,
Mennonite College, and Hamp-
den-Sydney College.

Eastern

The Generals lost, 32-23, to

ODAC rival Lynchburg, and

eked out a 29-30 victory over
Eastern Mennonite. Hampden-

Sydney forfeited, giving the

Generals a 15-50 victory. The
meet was run at Eastern Men-
nonite.

Angus McBryde placed first
for the Generals and fifth
overall with his fastest time this
season, a 26:56. Frank Pittman
finished seventh overall and se-
cond for the Generals with a
27:29. Jon Kelafant ran a 27:58,
placing tenth overall and third
for W&L. Captain Greg Branan
placed eleventh overall, fourth
for the Generals, and ran a
28:29. Steve Whetzle rounded
out the W&L top five with a thir-
teenth place finish and a 29:10
clocking.

Coach Dick Miller admitted
that the team ‘‘didn’t run well,”’
explaining that ‘‘the top five
spread was way off.” The ‘‘top
five spread’”’ is the length of
time that elapses between the

Commentary

first W&L finisher and the fifth.
At Eastern Mennonite, the
spread was 2:14. The spread is
usually around 1:40 or 1:45.
Pittman explained that
“everybody but Angus (Mc-
Bryde) had a bad day.” Look-
ing forward to this week’s meet,
the ODAC Championship, Pitt-
man predicts that the meet will
essentially be between W&L,
Lynchburg, and Roanoke Col-
lege. McBryde agreed, saying,

_“To win the ODAC, everybody

has to run really well. We’re
peaking for the ODAC.”

Kelafant says the team will
“be all rested and ready to go”
on Saturday. The ODAC Cham-
pionship is being run at Bridge-
water College this year, and
Kelafant commented on the
course. ‘“‘Bridgewater’s course
is all roads — like a road race.
I’d rather run on trails and I
think most guys would too. It’s
more scenic, like real cross-
country.”

Kelafant' described the
Generals’ performance _ this
past weekend as ‘‘just not hav-
hi that spark, we were kind of

at.”

The ODAC Championship
begins at 11:30 Saturday morn-
ing at Bridgewater College.

Generals Have
Room To Boast

by John Cleghorn

So far this fall W&L has two
teams well worth boasting
about. The Water Polo team is
record during this period is an
incredible 24-0-1.
League Championships. The
football team has also climbed
the ladder to sit atop the ODAC.

Amidst the refreshing suc-
cess of the football team and the
continual problems of the injury
barraged soccer team the con-
sistent dominance of the polo
team has been, if you will,

Dominance is an applicable
word for the polo team. Aside
from games with Slippery
Rock, Page Remillard’s
Generals are 26-1. The one other
loss is to Brown. The polo
team’s recognition should not
be couped up only to those that
frequent the indoor pool.

came out with the prediction
that Gary Fallon’s gridmen
could win the ODAC most of us
were pleasantly surprised, and
took it with a grain of salt. After

About Catholic

Coach Gary Fallon’s
Generals take their 6-2 record to
Washington this weekend to
play the Catholic University
Cardinals. Catholic is the
newest addition to the ten
member Old Dominion Athletic
Conference having been voted
in last. spring.

Twenty-seven lettermen
return this year to Catholic.
Pascale implements a 4-3
defense which returns only five
starters from last season.
Multiple offenses typify the
Cards as seven offensive
starters return. Last Saturday,

Catholic fell to the Generals
opening nemesis Gettysburg
6-0.

“The Cardinals are a big
unknown to us, simply because
we've only seen one film and
because we have so few com-
mon opponents. We'll
have to beware of them trying
to make an early mark in the
conference. They join the ODAC
competition next fall but play
two league schools this season.
We know they’d like to get the
jump on the ODAC so we look
for them to give it their all on
Saturday.”

Match Raises Money

by Eric Fife

Virginia Military Institute
out-played Washington and Lee
University Thursday in a soccer
match designed to raise money
for the Lexington-Rockbridge
United Way.

The match brought a 2-1 vic-
tory to VMI and more than
$1,100 to the local United Way
fund-raising effort.

According to Mrs. Penny
Henneman, Executive Director
of the Lexington-Rockbridge
United Way, the match was “a
complete success. It brought in
at least $1,100 and it got the
whole community, students and
local citizens, involved with the
fund-raising activities.”’

Mrs. Henneman said approx-

The Washington and Lee soc-
cer team will conclude its 1981
home schedule this Saturday by
playing host to the University of
Richmond in a 2 p.m. contest on
Wilson Field.

imately 500 persons attended
the match.

The United Way hopes the
VMI-W&L soccer match will be
used as an annual fund-raiser.
“We hope that the success of
this match will continue for
years to come,’ Mrs. Hen-
neman said.

Half-time featured an eight-
minute mini-match between
Lexington Youth Soccer teams;
the Hawks tied the Condors in
this mini-match.

Mrs. Henneman said the pro-
ceeds from the match bring this
year’s United Way campaign
total to about $35,000. She said
that exact figures on the cam-
paign’s success this far will be
released Tuesday.

On Wilson Field last Saturday
six players took part in the scor-
ing act to lead the Washington
and Lee varsity football team to
its fourth straight win, a 30-0
decision over ODAC rival
Bridgewater College.

W&L received touchdowns
from junior Chris Cavalline on a
six-yard run, classmate Ken
Robinson on a nine-yard run,
classmate Pat McGuire on a
one-yard run, and senior Mike
Fogarty on a 15-yard pass from
sophomore Al Paradise. Junior
Bill Devine added three point-
after conversions and a 40-yard
field goal, which equalled his
career best.

Cavalline, despite having on-
ly 36 yards rushing on the after-
noon, proved to be the key man
for the Generals offensively.

“We knew that Bridgewater
pursued the football aggress-
ively,’’. commented Head
Coach Gary Fallon. “Bridge-
water was so intent on contain-
ing Cavalline that we used
Cavalline as a decoy and ran
misdirection plays that kept
Bridgewater confused.’

By decoying Cavalline to the
right or left, the pursuit of the
Bridgewater linebackers . left
tight-end Fogarty wide open
over the middle. Paradise found
Fogarty nine times for 109
yards and one touchdown. All

together, Paradise completed |

14 of 21 passes for 141 yards.
The Generals rolled up 360

yards total offense. Defensive-

ly, W&L held Bridgewater to on-

ly 93 total offensive yards.

The win raised W&L’s overall
record to 6-2 and, coupled with a
24-18 Maryville victory over
Randolph-Macon, moved the
Generals into a first-place tie
with Maryville in the ODAC
standings.

Next week the Generals will
face this year’s addition to the
ODAC, the Catholic University
Cardinals. Last Week Catholic
suffered its fourth straight
defeat, a 6-0 setback to
Georgetown University.

both sides; with neither team
able to put more than one or two
passes before losing possession.
As a result, most of the shots
were taken from 40 or more
yards. It wasn’t all that surpis-
ing, then, that it took an embar-
rassing blunder by VMI keeper
Anthony Yelverton to create the
first scoring opportunity.

After making a routine save,
Yelverton prepared to kick the
ball away. He slipped on the wet
turf, though, and dropped the
ball; leaving sophomore Roland
Simon with an easy tap-in with
a minutes remaining in the

VMI tied that game at the 14-

when Steve Ross’ shot from the
right corner delfected off an ex-
tended Kirk Mancer. Freshman
Brian Colgan connected for the
winner on a sharp 15-yarder
directly in front of the W&L goal
after the Generals had failed to
clear the ball.

Fall Tennis Program

Comes To A Close

by Dan Tatum

Washington and Lee tennis
had its ups and downs this fall,
with the emphasis mainly on
downs. After being soundly
defeated at the U.S. Naval
Academy in a_ tournament
against Army, Navy, Swar-
thmore, Columbia, Penn State,
and Maryland. The netmen
were beaten by Ohio and
Maryland in the W&L Invita-
tional. However, W&L did
dominate tying singles 3-3 and
taking doubles 2-1. In the final
match of the season, James
Madison University came out

| ontop.

According to Head Coach
Franke the fall team was rather
young and_ inexperienced.
However, the fall program is

mainly meant to evaluate the
player’s abilities and to decide
who to ask back in the spring.
Coach Franke also said that the
tennis went up against some

tough and well seasoned op-
ponents this fall but the ex-
perience should prove valuable
in the spring in helping to
prepare the players for the
NCAA tournament.

The fall team was led by
senior captain and number two
player Wes Yonge, number one
player sophomore Graig Can-
non; and number three player
Charlie Kalosay, also a

sophomore. Other prominent
players were freshman Jaimie
Reilly ranked _ fourth,
sophomore Jim Irwin, ranked
fifth, and freshman Steve Bend
Bendheim, ranked sixth.

Coach Franke noted that the
performance of last year’s ten-
nis team in the nationals should
be a challenge to this year’s
team. He also expressed a hope
that anyone who was reluctant
to play in the fall will come out
for J.V. or varsity in the spring.

Parents’ Weekend Increases Sales By 30 Percent

by Patrick Jordan
Practically all Lexington
merchants’ interviewed

reported substantial increases
in sales during Washington and
Lee’s Parent’s Weekend.

According to Shirley Feazell,
Manager of the Athletic Attic,
the parents and students com-
ing into the store after
Washington and Lee’s football
game last Saturday resembled
‘“‘a herd of cattle stampeding
toward the door.”’

‘There were just mobs of peo-
ple everywhere,’’ said Feazell.
“This store’s sales for the
weekend were three times what
they were for parents’ weekend
last year and Saturday was the
biggest profit day ever.”’

She added that Washington
and Lee T-Shirts were the big-
gest seller with shoes a close se-
cond.

Connie Hostetter, a manager
at the Palm Parlor Restaurant,
said her business ‘‘jumped a
good 30-40 percent in its profits
over the average weekend.”’

According to Alvin Carter,
owner of the Alvin-Dennis
Clothes Store, parents’ weekend
is usually the top weekend for
sales at his business during the
year.

“T think that this Parents’
Weekend was better than
usual,”’ said Carter. ‘“The good
cool weather might have had a
lot to do with it and the date

was just late enough so as to
make the parents feel like get-
ting away from home.”

Bill Mason, part owner of the
Clothes Rack, said there was a
one-third increase in sales in his
store over the average week-
end. Mason added that this
year’s Parent’s Weekend was
more profitable than last
year’s.

Robert Candea, Manager of
Spanky’s, said his restaurant
served approximately 2400
meals over the weekend, not in-
cluding carryout orders.

Candea said that altohugh
Washington and Lee’s Parents’
Weekend was excellent, VMI’s
Parents’ Weekend is usually a
bit more profitable for the

above average profits last
weeken.

Betty Huffman, Manager of

Parents’ Weekend were about
average, except for film which
was in high demand.

She added that alumni
weekend for her business was
usually better than Washington
and Lee’s Parents’ Weekend.

Ryan Articles Published

Halford R. Ryan, associate
professor of public speaking at
Washington & Lee University,
recently published two articles
inscholarly journals.

One of Ryan’s articles,
published in the ‘Quarterly
Journal of Speech,’’ the oldest
and most prestigious speech
journal, examined the composi-
tion of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s
fourth inaugural address.

Ryan worked with 10 drafts of
the FDR address’ to determine
that speech writer Robert Sher-
wood composed the final ad-
dress from a core of Roosevelt’s
dictation. Ryan’s research also
showed that FDR rejected
drafts from his other speech
writers — Archibald MacLeish
and Judge Samuel Rosenman
—because they stressed mili-
tarism too much at a time when
FDR wanted to preview the
peace which would follow World
War II.

Ryan’s research into the arti-
cle, entitled ‘‘Roosevelt’s
Fourth Inaugural Address: A
Study of Its Composition,’ was

conducted on a grant from the
Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in
Hyde Park, N.Y. It is a con-
tinuation of his study of FDR’s
four inaugurals. He earlier had
published ‘‘Roosevelt’s First In-
augural: A Study of Technique”’
in a 1979 issue of the ‘‘Quarterly
Journal of Speech.”’

Ryan also published an arti-
cle entitled ‘Individual Speak-
ing Events: Two Organizational
Patterns’’ in the national
publication of the forensic
honorary society Delta Sigma
Rho — Tau Kappa Alpha. His
article in ‘Speaker and

~Gavel’’ examines speeches by
Edmund Burke, Patrick Henry,
Joseph McCarthy, and Richard
Nixon to illustrate how student
speakers could be more per-
suasive by using the ‘classical
pattern” (first invented by the
ancient Greeks) and _ the
‘Method of Residues.”

Ryan is a graduate of Wabash
College in Indiana. He received
both the M.A. and Ph.D. de-
grees from the University of Il-
linois,

Cockpit Makes Positive Changes For Customers

by Gregory A. Coy
Trying to bounce back from a
bad year, the Washington and
Lee Cockpit is taking on some
positive changes this year.

The “Pit” is a pub and fast-
food grill located in the Univer-
sity Center.

Student Manager Doug Lin-
ton indicated that labor costs
had put the Pit in the red.

“We had too much labor and
not enough business,”’ said Lin-
ton. ‘‘This year we had to cut
back on labor.”’

Indeed, the Cockpit has lost
many of its regular customers.
The lunch crowd, which con-
sists of professors and
townspeople, has dropped con-
siderably.

Linton said that the largest
drop was during night business
hours. Thursdays and Sundays
are the weakest days and nights

Japanese

(continued from page 4)

The movie is a
cinematographic version of the
fable of Sisyphus, who in Greek
mythology was condemned for-
ever to roll a huge stone up a
hill, only to have it roll down
again on nearing the top. This

fable has been taken as emble- .

makes on the viewer from one
excruciatingly suspenseful mo-
ment to another.

The film focuses. on the
hero Hoffman’s effort, amidst
police and radical attempts to
tell him who he is, to recon-
stitute his identity for himself.
It is in these terms that the
movie can be classified as a
mystery. The movie is literally
about the biogeneticist’s redis-
covery of what it means to be
human. And Hauff’s sense of
what being human means is so
rich that it enlarges the conven-
tionally accepted boundaries of
the mystery-thriller genre.

The hospital scenes in the
movie are wonderful. Hoffman

for the Pit.

The remainder of the week is
good, but not as prosperous as
in the past.

Although the profits are not
high this year, the first priority
of the Cockpit is not to make
money, according to Linton.

“The biggest misconception
about the Cockpit is the amount
of profit,” said Linton. ‘We
first cover labor cost, a break-
even operation, and the profits
go back into the Cockpit.”’

Linton strongly indicated that
the Cockpit ‘is a_ service,
primarily to the W&L communi-
ty.’”’ It is an important part of
the social life of the Washington
and Lee student.

A quicker service system and
a number of specials are part of
the positive change at the Pit.

“This is why we have initiated
the self-service ticket,’’ said
Linton.

“The customer takes the
ticket and makes his choice. He
then brings it up to the counter,
pays for it, and is brought his
food. A quicker system than the
conventional waiter/waitress
operation.”

The University Center Com-
mittee and the Cockpit are also
bringing in more entertainment
to the Pit, with live bands every
Tuesday.

Linton said that the Cockpit
will bring in local or regional
entertainment for weekends in
the future. Although Linton can
offer the band no more than a
meal and exposure, Bob
Schmidt and the UCC may offer
some small amount, no more
than $100 per month.

Film Series Ends

matic of the Existentialist
dilemma — the search for
meaning in an apparently ab-
surd universe. Woman in the
Dunes thus shows labor without
progress, but labor whose very
meaninglessness perhaps
enables the hero to discover a
sense of purpose in life.

The Japanese Film Series
was sponsored by W&L’s East
Asian Studies Program. The
films were made available
through the generosity of the
Japan Foundation, and were
shown in conjunction with the
W&L course ‘Japanese Liter-
ature in Translation.”

elegant comedy, Hauff touches
the heart of mans experience:
the life of the senses, muscular
coordination, language and
cognition, and sexuality. The
hero begins this odyssey with a
face so completely bandaged
that he can hardly be recogniz-
ed as human. Through this ban-
daged, humanoid front, he pro-
jects the sense of a con-
sciousness majestically
reawakening to full life.

The Film Society’s next
movie is Ingmar Bergman’s
The Magic Flute (Sweden,
1975); scheduled for December
4 and 5 as a pre-Christmas

The W&L Film Society brings

private contributors. Screenings

“It is W&L students that
make or. break the cockpit,”
said Linton.

He speculated that if the
students don’t patronize the

Cockpit, it might fold, and will
not be missed until it is too late.
Linton concluded saying that
he is open to any suggestion and
comments about the Cockpit.

11 Students Apply For
Fullbright Grants

by Eric Fife
11 Washington and Lee
students have submitted ap-
plications for Fullbright Grants
— a nation-wide scholarship
competition which provides full

funding for a year of study
abroad.

Dr. Charles Turner, a W&L
history professor, said there are
fewer applicants this year than
last. 14 students applied for the
grant last year, five were ac-
cepted.

A Fullbright Scholarship pro-
vides exceptional students from
colleges and universities across
the nation who are interested in
studying in a foreign country

_with an all-expenses-paid year

of study in a country of their
choice.

A grade-point-average of 3.0
is required for application, but
Turner said that few applicants

are accepted with less than a 3.5
G.P.A.

This year’s applicants from
W&L are applying for study in
eight different countries. Two
students have applied for study
in Mexico, two for England, two
for Finland and two for study in
France. Turner has received

one application each for study
in Switzerland, Japan, West
Germany and Sweden.

Applicants may choose to
study in any of 50 countries.
Last year, 576 students were
chosen to be Fullbright
Scholars.

Applications are submitted
through each college’s
Fullbright officer, who advises
the applicant how to complete
the application. The Fullbright
officer forwards the applica-
tions to the national scholarship
board for consideration.

On Sept. 24, the Executive Committee passeda mo- |

‘ion which approved of such a symposium. The com-
mittee left itself with an escape valve, as it were, by
holding back on funding. The EC also did not give any
definite framework for a subcommittee to follow.

Only one question persists at this time: what has
happened to the symposium? Participation in the
symposium has been limited at best — and we really
can't understand why. To say one participated in an
intellectual symposium seems to be the ideal resume
fodder. Perhaps students are intimidated by the title
“intellectual symposium.” Or perhaps students just
don't care.

To call the symposium dead would be jumping the
gun, but itis not an unlikely prospect. The faculty has
already stressed the educational benefits from this
gathering and the EC has given tentative support.
Responsibility clearly lies with the student body,
which will either push the symposium forward or
allow it to die from neglect.

The irony of the situation is that Washington and
Lee takes pride in its intellectual standards, yet can-
not muster enough support to hold an intellectual
gathering every four years. If the symposium does in-
deed pass away, the W&L community should be both
ashamed and appalled.

Phi Editorial Termed Destructive

Dear Sir:

In response to your editorial
of October 29th concerning the
ethics involved with the adver-
tising of The Country Wife we
feel it is important to point out
that the play, written by
William Wycherley in the late
1600's, is a satire on the sexual
standards of that period. This
play contains the subliminal
sexual innuendoes which you
felt were so offensive and
sophmoric in our advertising.

{f the learned staff members
of the Ring-tum Phi had read

the play and known their sub-

ject (as is a basic rule of good ©

journalism) then they might
have been spared the embar-
rassment of criticizing a sub-

 

ject that they obviously had no
knowledge of.

In conclusion, our efforts to
promote this play were con-
structive, while your attempt to
criticize our efforts was
destructive. In the future, it
would be in your own best in-
terests to better know your sub-
ject before subjecting your
readers to your editorial opin-
See you at the play!

Sincerely,
The Publicity Crew
of The Country Wife

Editor Ignorant Of ‘Country Wife’

Dear Sir:

The editor of The Ring-tum
Phi is apparently ignorant of
what The Country Wife is ail
about. A witty man, Wyncherly
found out about a very sensual
intrigue | had during my rakish
years in London town. The cir-
cumstances of that intrigue
were rife with sexual innuendo
and subliminal suggestiveness.
Wyncher!y wrote down all the
bawdy language, social hypoc-
risy and behind-the-screen af-
fairs.

On another level, Wyncher-
ly’s story is also about my
friend Harcourt’s submission to
real love, loyalty to that one
woman and the institution of
marriage. But the public
throngs will be in the best mood
for The Country Wife, that
epitome of Restoration plays, if
they have a prior suspicion ot

perclassman. Because the rat seemed to be enjoy-
ing it, he got to know the upperclassman a little
better at the next sweat party.

‘*A friend and I walked by him, letting him think
I didn’t see him. Then I turned around and said,
‘‘well it’s you, give me 20 push-ups.’’ He made the
rat repeat this five times, then said, ‘‘see you at
the next sweat party,” toscare him.

The cadets explained that only seniors can make
the rats drop and do calisthenics during the day.
Any upperclassman can ‘‘send a rat up” to be
disciplined by a freshman discipline board.
Demerits are commonly given for being late. One
rat was given demerits for violating a sanction
against pets by having a fly in his room, the cadets
said. He was given additional demerits for letting
it die. One oriental exchange student was sent up
for ‘‘slanting his eyes in ranks.”’

At a sweat party, the freshmen must be given
three minutes rest for every fifteen of exercise.
The cadets sometimes give all the rest time at the
beginning of an hour session as the rats are in the
“up” position of a push-up. Push-ups, sit-ups,
bootslappers, and running in place follow.

“You just break him down -to see what he’s
made of,”’ said one of the group about freshmen.
Some bear up well. A rat with wandering eyes in
formation was grilled, ‘What are you looking
around for? You want to buy the place?” The rat
answered,’’Have you got change for a quarter?”

Others wash out quickly on the rat line. One ran
screaming down what is now the Chessie Nature
Trail, shedding clothes, until he was found naked
on a rock. Another was fount seated, staring
blankly, when they turned on the lights one morn-
ing in the library. The pressure of practical jokes
led another to the edge of one of the balconies,
where he threatened to throw himself off.

‘“ ‘Jump, jump!’ everybody yelled.”

“If you’re a loser, everybody’s going to know
it,’’ said one cadet. ‘‘At a school of this size, you
know everybody.”’ If the esprit de corps surfaces
as practical joking and sweat parties inside the
barracks, it produces a fierce loyalty on the out-
side.

Cadets stick together in town and acknowledge
that they do not like to travel alone. ‘‘That’s true,
we’re pretty tight. Guys help each other out in
fights.”’ Another qualified that: ‘‘they even it up,
keep everyone else off.”’

With fraternities barred to those who have no
approved invitations, cadets rarely venture into
town. “Even if you’re not on confinement,” said
one cadet, there is no big reason to go into Lex-
ington. He could count several three-week periods
when he did not leave the vicinity of campus.
When you are not with other cadets, said one, ‘‘you
just don’t have the gumption to go uptown.”’

 

“If you're a loser,
everybody's going to
know it. At a school
of this size, you

know everybody.”’

Tensions build up so much during the week that
“when you go out, everything is in excess.”
Everyone goes completely bazoo,”’ joked another.

“You look forward to getting out of here,” a
cadet said. Others agreed that it was hard to see
the benefit of the aggravating, hard-as-C-rations
system. They all know the cliche, however, that
though you hate VMI when you’re in, you love it
when you’re finally out.

Why did the come to Virginia Military? “It’s a _
country club.”’

The majority of cadets at the clandestine
meeting were studying engineering. Only 15 per-
cent, they said, intended to make a career of the
military. One came because his father went.
Another said his parents gave him no choice.

A foreign student believed he was applying to
VPI instead of VMI. The cadets said he was here
three weeks before realizing that it was not the
Virginia Polytechnic Institute. One was told by his
parents that they were only sightseeing on the way
to school in West Virginia. Whe he stepped out to
look at VMI, his bags were pushed out and he was
abandoned.

‘‘T thought I was going away from trouble—and I
found it,’’ said a cadet who had been punished with
extensive confinement.

He and all other cadets were pardoned from con-
finement and penalty tours by President Ronald
Reagan at Yorktown. October’s Bicentenniel
celebration at the sight of the last battle of the
American Revolution included marching Keydets
in full uniform.

‘That was suck, that really sucked,”’ said one.

‘“‘We were standing there more than two hours,
freezing our cods off...listening to Francois (Mit-
terand, French president).”’

What did they think of W&L students? No one
wanted to answer.

One finally spoke up. He recalled the ‘Nuke
Iran Rally” two years ago. Washington and Lee
students led a torch parade to VMI, where
freshmen showed their sympathy by shaking
rifles from the windows.

“The only thing that bothered me was that after
the Iran rally, a W&L student told me that if there
was a war, he would go off to Canada.”’ Nor did the
other cadets like the idea of dying for a bunch of
warhooping minks.

“Your talking about people shooting at each
other, (that’s) some serious s--t,” said another
cadet.

‘Make love, not war,” grinned a third.

“Do you think we’re warmongers?” asked
another.

‘Wrong. We’d rather stay at the country club.”’

One hotel dorm counselor
noted that freshmen usually
aren’t allowed to park their
cars near their residence
anyway. But, being an up-
perclass student, he feels that
dorm counselors should have
the right to park there. He
stated, ‘‘It’s kind of a hassle to
us, not being able to park
anywhere near where we live.”

This rule concerning the hotel
parking lot was concluded in the
best interests of the hotel and
the University, and was includ-
ed in the lease. Other than this
complaint, the students seem
happy with their rooms and liv-
ing conditions.

Narins said that he gets sick
of the walk to campus, but in
reference to the size of his
room, he remarked, “‘It’s pretty
good.’’ He alsonoted the advan-
tages that students living in the

hotel have over students in the -

dorms. For example, hotel
freshmen may keep televisions
in their rooms and the rooms

have wall-to-wall carpeting. In
addition, every room either has
its own bathroom, or shares one
with another room. Narins men-
tioned that it is slightly difficult
to study in the hotel because of
the noise, but added, ‘‘It’s pro-
bably like that anywhere.”

One third-floor dorm

counselor remarked that he
hadn’t heard any complaints
about the distance to campus.
He said it’s not a big factor and
noted that the main problems
(the elevators and the pulling of
the fire alarms) are ones that
‘occur in any building. He went
on to say that most of the
freshmen in the hotel chose to
live there. There has only been
one student who has wanted to
move to the dorms, but this was
due to a roommate conflict.

cadets and Lexington townies,
especially in the Lee Tavern.
The chance of conflict is much
higher than it is on campus. Ad-
ditionally, the bar is loud at
night.

Bob Bryant, a freshman hotel
resident, said he enjoys living in
the hotel and remarked that
“The only problem I’ve had is
that there have been some in-
stances of people pulling fire
alarms. We think they’re
townies.”” Bryant mentioned
that the carpeting in the room
does keep things quieter.

Why did Bryant choose to live
in the hotel? ‘‘To be different,’’
he simply replied.

Another freshman living in
the hotel, Brian O’Biordan,
compared his living quarters
with those students residing on
campus when he said, ‘‘We’re

not in nearly as bad shape as
the people in Gilliam.”’ O’Bior-
dan continued, ‘‘It could be bet-
ter here but it also could be a
hell of a lot worse.’’ He mention-
ed that the location of the hotel
does isolate the students a little
and it also makes it easier for
fraternity kidnapping to take
place.

While the students are
generally satisfied living in the
hotel, the hotel administration
is similarly pleased with the
set-up thus far. Clyde Mull is
the former owner of the Robert
E. Lee Hotel who signed the
lease with the University for
this year. He sold the hotel two
months ago and has stayed on
until the new owners take over.

Mull has no complaints about
the students and said that
everything is ‘real smooth.”
Mull stated that the freshmen

are respecting the elevator and
taking pretty good care of it.
Mull also noted that problems
are kept down because of the
situation of the dorm counselors
and their supervision. “Dorm
counselors have taken a very
positive step toward seeing that
rules and regulations are
obeyed,” stated Mull.

The former owner said that
three years ago, when freshmen
were living in the hotel, ‘‘It was
pretty bad. This year there’s
really no comparison.”’ Mull
mentioned that much thought:
went into the negotiations with
the University before the lease
was signed. Mull Went on to
say, ‘I’m very well pleased to
this point. I thought there would
be more problems than we have
encountered, which is practical-
ly nil.”’

Mull noted that he has heard
hardly any complaints from
freshmen. “I think they realize
the importance of the renova-
tion probject (Graham-Lees),’’
said Mull.

IFC Places Six Houses On Social Pro

(continued from page 1)
SNU spokesman Chris Stokes
stated that no SNU’s were in-
volved in the incident. He added
that several students had seen
people who didn’t belong to SNU
on the top floor of the fraterni-
ty’s fire escape. Stokes also said
that a rumor had been cir-

culating that Sigma Nu had ©

planned a demolition party in
order to destroy the house.
Stokes denied that any such
party was planned and warned
his brothers that “if you see
anybody do anything to our
house, kick them out.’ He went
on to say that the SNU’s were

adverse to bottle throwing
because of the previous IFC
warning.

The Phi Kaps reported six
windows and three window
frames were broken by bottles
emanating from the SNU house.
However, the Phi Kaps were

Graham-Lees Renovation Still On

(continued from page 1)

At the present time, the fourth floor is near com-
pletion. The walls still need to be painted, the floor
tiled and doors need to be replaced. In contrast,
only structural work has been completed on the

first floor.

The architectural plans call for the same style,
but lighting, wiring and plumbing will be moder-
nized. The stairwells are being enclosed and each
room will be equipped with a fire sprinkler system
to conform to fire codes. A ramp has been built to
help handicapped individuals. The university will
also lose some housing space because of necessary

space arrangements.

The construction work is being done by the Bass
Construction Company of Richmond. This firm
also worked on Lewis Hall, the University Library

and McCormick Hall.

The Lee dorm was completed in 1904, and
Graham in 1920. In 1941, the two were renovated

and connected by the addition of a middle wing,
which formed the U-shaped complex.
