President Hundley Announces Resignation

Robert E. R. Huntley, presi-
dent of Washington and Lee
University. since 1968, an-
nounced at a faculty meeting
Monday that he will resign from
his position effective at the end
of 1982.

Huntley, 52, said that he had
made his decision known to
W&L’s board of trustees as far
back as October, 1981. James
M. Ballenge, rector of the
university’s board of trustees,
said he was saddened by
Huntley’s decision, adding that
Huntley “had been the most
outstanding president of
Washington and Lee since
Robert E. Lee.”

In an interview Monday after-
noon, President Huntley con-
firmed that his decision was
based on his belief that ‘‘prin-
cipal things had been achieved”’
during his tenure. Huntley add-
ed that he decided to keep his
decision confidential since Oc-
tober in order to guarantee that
the last phases of the school’s
ten-year, $67-million develop-
ment plan would be a success.

Under university procedure,
an advisory committee com-
posed of faculty members will
consider candidates before the
trustee board makes a decision.
Huntley noted that the faculty
advisory committee met last
Monday to consider ways of
relating the procedure to both
students and alumni organiza-
tions..

With Feb. 5 marking the 14th
year of his tenure as president,
Huntley, in a letter to alumni,
faculty and friends of the
university said, ‘‘quite simply, I
feel I have been in the job long
enough.”’

Huntley was named president
of Washington and Lee on Jan.
3, 1968, but did not officially
enter office until Feb. 5. He is

the 20th president of -Wash-
ington and Lee and the seventh
successor of Robert E. Lee.

A 1950 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee, Huntley was the
first alumnus to serve as the
university’s president since
pre-Civil War times.

Huntley said that when he
first became president of W&L, ©
the “hoped to assist in pro- |
viding financial needs, the ex- |
pansion of the curriculum and
the strengthening of the pursuit |, ;
of a liberal arts education.” ¢
Huntley said he also carried
“the hope to maintain and
strengthen the quality of the
student body.”

“‘Thave achieved as muchas I
can achieve,” said the presi-
dent. ‘‘The achievements that
have occurred here are quite
strong and commendable. It
seems to me that it’s time for a
new president.”’

Huntley has no definite plans
for the future, saying he would
be open to the possibility of
teaching again, but would make
no specific statements.

As for a successor, Huntley
made no predictions, but said
that the university should look
for someone with “academic
and administrative talents and
the ability to communicate.”’

Huntley noted that Wash-
ington and Lee is an especially
attractive job since “the at-
mosphere for the president is
pleasant. You’re not in the eye
of a storm, nor are there power
plays.”’

Following his graduation
from Washington and Lee,
President Huntley served for
three years in the U.S. Navy
before returning to W&L to
study law.

As a law student, he was
recognized as the senior who

Superdance °82 Collects Nearly $24,000

by Tom Baker
The Washington and Let
Muscular Dystrophy Dance-
athon, an annual event that has
become a source of pride for the
W&L community, raised a

record $23,882 this past
weekend.
Approximately 140 people

danced from Friday night to
early Sunday morning in Evans
Dining Hall this past weekend.
Superdance chairman Tripp
Brower was appreciative of
everyone’s efforts, expressing
thanks “‘to everyone who con-
*. tributed, especially Mr. (Jerry)
Darrell (director of the dining
hall), who did so much for us
like always.”

At least 60 expected dancers
failed to show, but Brower add-
ed, ‘You gotta go with what you

Grade Inflation:

by Scott Kennedy

In the past decade SAT scores
have dropped while the grade-
point-average of many colleges
has risen. Educational experts
cast the blame for this on grade
inflation.

Grade Inflation, the tendency
of professors to give higher
grades, is said to have started
during the turmoil of the sixties.
Many anti-war professors
realized that giving poor grades
lowered the chances of male
students attempting to enter
graduate programs thus allow-
ing them to be drafted.

Since many public institu-
tions were forced at the time to
admit minorities, they hesi-
tated to issue disheartening
grades.

It is the general attitude of the
Washington and Lee University
administration that grade infla-
tion is not currently present
here and never has been.

The Grade Point Average of
the student body at Washington
and Lee for the past two
decades has risen only slightly.
It rose from a 2.5 average in
1963-64 to 2.7 in 1979-1980. The
percentage of A’s doubled in
that same period, however.

Dean William Watt has con-
tributed this increase to the fact
that ‘‘some students are study-

ing more intensively than
before.”” Watt believes that
more students are attempting
to go on to graduate schools.
Dean Waitt also accounted the
increase to the change in the

“Grade inflation was a problem in the

70’s, but you don’t hear much about it
Dean William Watt

anymore.”

 

Another factor was the
liberalizing of the education.
Since many teachers received
evaluations from their students,
they attempted to earn a good
review by giving higher grades.

In the mid-1970’s, grade infla-
tion had reached epidemic pro-
portions. Many schools tried to
curb the problem. At University
of North Carolina, for example,
the number of A’s doubled be-
tween 1962 and 1972. A U.N.C.
dean reacted by sending a letter
to the department heads asking
them to keep grades down.
Grades thus began to drop.

There is a faction inside the
educational community, how-
ever, which defends grade infla-
tion. This group argues that
grading each student on the
same scale is unfair. In their
view grade inflation gives each
student the same opportunity to
get an A. These educationists
say that giving lower grades
does not raise standards.

curriculum in 1970. The altera-
tion eliminated some required
courses and thus allowed
students to enroll in courses
they would prefer out of choice,

not obligation.
Van Pate, the Assistant
Director of Admissions,

believes that the coincidence in
the rises of percentages of both
F’s and A’s indicates that W&L
is admitting more good and
poor students and less average
students.

amount of participants.
Only eight to ten dancers did
not finish the danceathon.

Michael Wyatt, ’82, was the
dancer with the highest amount
of total pledges brought in
$1400. Kevin Gray, a third-year
law student, was second with
nearly $800 in pledges and
Amelia Mundin, with $480 in
pledges, was third. | ;

President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley spoke to the dancers at the
conclusion of the event, con-
gratulating the dancers on a job
well done. Noting that the dance
had become an_ established
event at W&L, Huntley ex-
pressed his hope that the event
would only improve.

According to Finance Chair-
man M. Shaw Pyle, the success

Does It

Dean Watt admits that in the
mid-1970's W&L did discuss the
problem. That was at the same
time when many other institu-
tions dealt with grade inflation.
Dean Watt, who was on a state

‘commission to investigate the
problem in Virginia, said
“grade inflation was a problem
in the 70’s but you don’t hear
much about it anymore.”

Many education officials
believe that grade inflation has
entered high schools as well as
colleges. According to Pate,
“an A at some schools is a C at
others.”

In an attempt to deal with
grade inflation among ap-
plicants, W&L tries to look at
both grade-percentage spreads
and grade percentiles. The Ad-
missions Office also tries to look
at the high school’s record of
placing its graduates in college.

When a student graduates
from college and applies for a
position with a company, does
the company take grade infla-
tion into account? According to

‘Mike Cappeto, University
Placement Director,

to look more closely at the in-
dividual’s character. Although
grades are of course important
to a point but companies don’t
try to decipher the grade infla-
tion at the school.

of the danceathon was ensured,
despite the lower-than-expected
turnout of dancers, by the large
number of people who came to
hear the bands.

On both Friday and Saturday
nights, Evans Dining Hall was
filled with a maximum at 750
persons. With 12 hours of
capacity crowds, “‘the money
was made at the band and at the
gate,”’ according to Pyle. Pyle
estimated that, because people
had to be turned away, ‘‘$50-
$100-a-minute in revenues were
lost because tickets couldn’t be
sold when the cafeteria was
filled to capacity.”

Another successful portion of
the dance was a series of pie
throws in which the targets
were W&L faculty members.

Weaken

This event brought in a total of
$670. With a bid of $200, jour-
nalism professor Robert de

Maria was the most-coveted

target.

The main concern of those
associated with the dance is
now to collect all the money that
was pledged. With a collection
rate between 80 and 90-percent,
Pyle estimates that, after all
the bills are paid, the Super-
dance could net as much as
$18,000, all of which goes to the
M.D. national organization.

Exemplifying the continuing
success of the event, several
people have suggested that
Superdance ’83 be moved to the
gym so that there will be more
room for dancers and spec-
tators.

not affect W&L graduates
because of the school’s high
reputation.

Graduate and law schools are

E.C. Rejects Three Proposals
For Adding Two New Members

by Ben Jarratt
The Executive Committee re-
jected three proposals Monday
night that would have added one
or two new members to this
body.

Two weeks ago, Third Year -

Law Rep. Morgan Grittith in-
troduced a plan that would have
added a second year law
representative and an addi-
tional one from the freshmen
class. The honor system func-
tions of the E.C. would have
changed slightly.

Griffith's plan would increase
the number of representatives
to 14. The honor system changes
would prevent the two members
of the investigating team from
sitting in on an honor violation
hearing.

After debating the issue at the
two previous meetings, Griffith
motioned for the constitutional
changes involving the addi-
tional representatives be ac-
cepted, along with a rider that
the committee would look into
the honor system changes.

The motion was defeated 2-9.
Griffith and Frank Smith, ‘83
Rep., voted in favor; Tripp
Brower, '82 Rep., was absent.

Freshman Rep. Cole Dawson
then motioned that the constitu-
tional changes be accepted,
without any consideration of
changing the honor system.

Ken Lang, '82 Rep., objected
to increasing the E.C. by one or
two members. ‘It comes to a
point where this body can’t
function.”’

Griffith commented it would
be fairer to have another
freshmen and law school rep.
Each law class would have its
own representative and elec-
tions would be easier to con-
duct.

E.C. President Eric Myers
stated that the ultimate reason
for only two law school reps.
was “to get a_ proportional

representation of the law
school, in order to be judged by

 

their peers. This proportion is
the basis of the honor system.”’

Dawson’s motion failed, 5-6.
Dawson, Griffith, Smith, First
Year Law Rep. Tom Booher
and John Viahoplus, ’83 Rep.
voted in favor of the proposal.

Griffith then moved that only
an additional freshmen
representative be added to the
E.C. Myers stated it was best
not to tinker with the system if
there was no problem to ad-
dress.

The motion was also rejected,
5-6. Dawson, Griffith, Smith,
Booher and Vlahoplus voted in
favor.

In other matters, the E.C.
heard a report from the Student
Activities Board. Co-chairman
John Martin said the S.A.B.
made a couple of investments
for Fancy Dress, which _ in-
creased the budget. He men-
tioned a $2,500 ceiling cover for
Doremus Gym as an example.

Martin said the W&L Alumni
Magazine has come out with an
article on this year’s Ball. A
concert has not yet been
booked, as Martin stated there
is no justification in wasting
$15,000 on second-rate talent.

The co-chairman added that
Jerry Darrell, director of food
services, was pleased with the
success of the Reggae Party
held in Evans Dining Hall. Dar-
rell has indicated his support
for future concerts.

S.A.B. Treasurer Randall
Jacoby reported the Films
Committee lost money because
of a poor lineup of movies. On
The Yard cost $350; but grossed
only $9 at the door. ‘‘It was a no-
name movie, with no-name ac-
tors,’ stated Jacoby. ‘‘I told the
films chairmen, Don Richard-
son and Rusty Lee, not to order
.

University Committee Chair-
man Bob Schmidt said revenues
have picked up in the Cockpit as
a result of ‘‘Tuesdays’ "’ enter-
tainment; labor costs have also

been held down. This has helped
the Cockpit run Happy Hours on
Thursdays and Fridays.

Martin added that the Cockpit
recently presented a $500 check
to the S.A.B. for entertainment.
The two groups try to work
together in this area.

Griffith commented on the
treacherous sidewalk condi-
tions at the law school and gym
over the past two weeks. He felt
the school did not do enough to
clear the sidewalks of ice. He
mentioned that if a lawsuit
arose, the university is legally
not responsible.

Myers added the same condi-
tions existed around the main
campus. The committee would
point this problem out to the
university.

F. Lee Bailey, who has gained
national prominence as the
defense attorney in such
celebrated cases as Dr. Sam
Sheppard, The _ Boston
Strangler, Capt. Ernest Medina
and Patty Hearst, will speak at
Washington and Lee University
on Thurs., Feb. 4.

Bailey’s speech will be at 8
p.m. in W&L’s Lee Chapel. It is
open to the public. Admission is
free. Bailey is the fourth
speaker this academic year in
the university’s Contact pro-
gram, a_ visiting speakers’
forum sponsored jointly by the
interfraternity council and the
student body.

A self-professed ‘‘renegade”’
who claims that specializing in
criminal law “makes me a
rebel by profession,” Bailey has
often suggested that his unor-
thodox route to the criminal bar
is one reason for his success.

A native of Waltham, Mass.,
and a graduate of Kimball
Union Academy, he entered

‘Modern Problems’

Review:

A Woeful

by Todd Jones

Modern Problems is Chevy
Chase’s latest comedy venture.
The cast includes such excellent
comedians as Patti D’Arbin-
ville, Brian Doyle-Murray,
Dabney Coleman, and Nell
Carter. Even these talented ac-
tors could not make Modern
Problems a winner, however.

Modern Problems certainly
does not have a_ poignant
message. The plot revolves
around a man, (Chevy), who ac-
cidentally is exposed to radioac-
tive waste. He finds he is
telekinetic and starts moving
things wherever he _ pleases.

From cups and mugs to ballet
dancers, to stuffed animals. His
girlfriend is in the process of
leaving him, but still feels a cer-
tain something. They decide to
go to a beachhouse which is
owned by one of Chase’s high
school buddies. The buddy, con-
fined to a wheelchair after the
Vietnam War, is spending the
weekend at the beachhouse with
Chase’s ex-wife. Add to this
group an egotistical author of
sex manuals and a housemaid
from Port-Au-Prince, and the
final scenes are ready to be
played to a climax.

The major problem with

Modern Problems is that there
is not enough funny material.
Chase can only make things
move for so long and then the
routine gets old. Because of
this, Chase spends a lot of time
making strange faces. -The
faces are funny the first time,
but rarely do they entertain on
the seventh.

Brian Doyle-Murray rolls
through the film in a part that
seems to be custom-made for
George Carlin. He even looks
like Carlin. His part is not only
an uninteresting one, but it has
no relationship to the plot.

Film Society Airs ‘Lancelot’

by Carren O. Kaston

Fifth in this year’s Film
Society series is Robert
Bresson’s version of the King
Arthur legend, Lancelot of the
Lake (France, 1974: 85
minutes). Screenings will take
place free of charge on Friday
and Saturday, Feb. 5 and 6, at 8
p.m. in Lewis Hall ‘‘A.”

An important figure in
French cinema since the 1940’s,
Bresson has directed The
Ladies of the Bois de
Boulogne(1945), Diary of a

Country Priest (1950),
Pickpocket (1959), Au Hasard,
Balthasar (1966), Mouchette
(1966), and Four Nights of a
Dreamer (1971). His movie A
Condemned Man _ Escaped
(1956), based on an episode of
the French Resistance, has
been called by Francois Truf-
faut “the most crucial French
film of the past ten years.”

reveal an interest in states of

Arthur’s vision of a perfect

snatches out of time a golden

between man and man, and

The Cockpit ‘Tellurides’ This Friday

Vhe following article is reprinted
from the Birmingham  Post-
Herald Kudzu of Friday, Feb. 1,
1980.

FRIDAY NIGHT.

For many it means heading
for a smoky barroom, ordering
a cold one and slumping :into a
seat for the night to put their
feet up and let their hair down.

But drinking isn’t enough to
satisfy most. They want music.
And for that there are bar
bands.

And what is a bar band? It is
simply, a working-man’s band.
The members aren’t on any
worldwide tour. They don't
show up in limousines. There
isn’t any caviar waiting for
them backstage, if there even is
abackstage.

They play more music in the
course of an evening than many
major groups play in a few days
of touring. And chances are,
they do it four times a week,
almost every week of the year,
for a fraction of the money.

Telluride is a band cut from
that cloth. Any given week you

can find them somewhere in
town. And when you can’t find
them in town, they’re probably
playing in some other city.

By bar band standards they
are relatively old — four years
some time this month. But they
have been through their share
of changes. Two of the original
band members have moved on
to other things. Their music has
switched from a country in-
fluence to a harder-edged rock
sound

One thing is constant.

They keep on playing.

“It’s very demanding,’’ said
“Moose” Harrell, a guitarist
and original member of the
band. “‘It’s hard to stay up all
the time.

‘You have to put out a lot of
energy to excite people. When
we go on break, for the first 15
minutes I’m a zombie.”’

The band got its start in the
friendship of Harrell and the
band’s other guitarist, Rick
Carter. The two started playing
together after meeting in
Mobile. Harrell was in school at

‘Modern Problems’

(continued from page 4)
Dabney Coleman plays the
same type of role he played in
Nine To Five. His part seems to
be in the film only because they
could get him in the film.

The one bright spot in the film
is Nell Carter. She plays a
superstitious maid who decides
that there is an evil spirit in
Chase, and she must combat it,
whether it be with demon dust
or with her bare knuckles. She
plays her part well, and she has

Even Nell Carter’s wonderful
performance cannot
save Modern Problems. The
failure of the film is in the
script, no matter how hard the
cast tries to make that not mat-
ter. In fact, they sometimes try
so hard that many scenes look
pushed.

Modern Problems is too slow
to be a comedy, too ridiculous to
be a satire or drama, and too
bad to be anything else.
Because of a poor dialogue a
good cast ends up with a poor
movie.

the time at the University of
South Alabama.

In the summer of ’75 the two
started a group, “mostly for
fun” called Highway. When
Harrell graduated in December
of that year he and Carter got
together the original Telluride
with Jim Liner on bass, Robert
Churchill on drums and Roger
Bailey on piano.

(The name comes from a city
in Colorado. It’s a streamlined
version of an old phrase — “‘To
hell you ride’’ — miners used to
describe trips to far-flung
spots. )

Unlike other bands in town
that play music in addition to
other jobs, Telluride has pur-
sued their music with the idea
of being full-time musicians.

And they are a success.

‘“‘We’ve pretty well covered
the state (as far as playing
goes),’’ said Carter. The band
has played Tuscaloosa, Mobile
and Auburn. “We've got a good
following.’

So good, in fact, that Harrell

said the band is in the position
that ‘“‘we really don’t have to
compete with anybody in the ci-
ty. “We have to turn down
dates.”’

The band even has a good
working relationship with
another band that has a con-
siderable following in town
—Hotfoot. ‘‘We’re one big fami-
ly,” Harrell notes. The two
trade equipment as well as play
together under the name Hot-
pride.

Harrell likes to think of

Telluride as ‘‘a people’s band.”’
He thinks that separates them
from bigger ‘“‘concert bands”’
that play a show and then leave.

Not that the band wouldn’t
like to be a concert band
They’re working to that enc
now. Telluride currently has
about 12 original numbers that
they’d like to put on a new
album.

‘“‘We want to reach as many
people as we can,”’ said Harrell,
“which is really what it’s all
about.”’

Generals Gain Conference Lead ports

 

  

 

Sophomore guard Bill. Yates,

the Generals’ ‘most intense
defense” looks for an inside

by G. Bruce Potter

This is undoubtedly a season
of parity for Old Dominion
Athletic Conference basketball,
so, as Washington and Lee Head
Coach Verne Canfield says,
“You better win at home and
hope for a split on the road.”’

And that’s exactly what his

, Generals have done as a home

victory over Maryville 62-60
kept their ODAC record in the
Warner Center unblemished
and a 73-69 overtime win at
Emory and Henry Tuesday
night evened their road record
at 2-2. Not coincidentally the
team moved into first place in
the conference with a 7-2 mark
(13-5 overall).

Junicr forward Jay Fechtel
hit both ends of a one-and-one fo
give W&L the lead for good over
Emory and Henry with 1:46 lett
in the overtime period. George
Spears added six points in the
extra session to spark the
squad.

With 2:19 left in the first half, °

the Generals took their biggest
lead of the game at 27-20 on a
bucket by Brian Hanson, who
led the squad with 22 points and
9 rebounds. However, the

Wasps rebounded for 10° un-
answered points and took a
30-27 lead with 17:12 remaining
in the game.

The Generals battled back to
take a 45-40 lead on a basket by
Spears, who finished with 19
points, with the clock showing
8:23. However, in action that
truly typified the see-saw strug-
gle (the lead changed hands 17
times), E&H came back to take
leads at 53-51 and 55-54.
However, John Lee Graves’
three-point play at 1:11 gave the
Generals a 57-55 edge. ;

Emory and Henry missed
their first attempt to tie the
game up, but managed to get
the rebound, call time out, and
knot the score at 57 when they
hit both ends of a one-and-one
following a Graves’ foul. Billy
Yates’ desperation 25-footer at
the buzzer was off the mark,
setting the stage for the over-
time.

Both teams shot well from the
floor, 62.2% for W&L and 57.1%
for the Wasps, and poorly from
the foul line, 68% and 55.5% ,
respectively.

The 62-60 squeaker over
Maryville typified Canfield

W&L Swimmers Set ‘Best Times ’

by John M. Cleghorn

Washington and Lee swimmers continue to rank
as leaders in the nation, according to the latest
‘Best Times” standings. W&L men appear in six’
of the nine top-ten rankings for individual events
as a team, in both relay events. This widespread
appearance in national rankings is especially im-
pressive in light of the fact that there are 170 other
teams that compete on the Division III level.

Mike Bernot is again atop the 50-yard freestyle
list with a time of 21.21 seconds. Sophomore team-
mate Rand McClain follows closely with his own
time of 21.68. Bernot also leads the best-times list
for the 100-yard freestyle event as well as turning
in the fourth best time in the 200-yard free. Tim
Rock accompanies Bernot and McClain on the na-
tional level with a 4:48.57 time for the 500-yard
free style, which places him fourth in the nation.
Rock also swims the second-fastest 1,000-yard free
in Division III.

Sophomore Jeff Gee and junior Rob Crawford
are just off the Jan. 26 best times list in the 200-
yard backstroke and the 200-yard breast-stroke
respectively. Head Coach Page Remillard expects
both Gee and Crawford to move back up in the
times very soon.

The W&L 400-yard free style relay team holds
the number one position with a time of 3:43.46.
Also appearing in the relay standings, the 400-yard
medley relay team stands as number nine in the
nation. Looking forward to a restful break,

Remillard predicts that W&L can move into each
of the individual best-times lists before the end of
the season.

—“——_

Narrowing the focus to Old Dominion Athletic
Conference basketball, Washington and Lee has
moved into similar leading positions. As of games
through Feb. 4, W&L maintains the conference
lead with a record of 7-2 and holds the second best
overall record at 13-5 behind Roanoke at an im-
pressive 16-2.

As a teaiu, W&L ranked fifth in scoring offense,
second in scoring defense, had the second-highest
scoring margin and the second-highest rebound
margin in the conference in the Feb. 2 rankings.

Part of the key to W&L’s success has been con-
sistent shooting. In both free throws and field goal
attempts, Washington and Lee sat atop the ODAC.

In individual statistics, John Lee Graves was
tenth in scoring with 240 points in 17 games for a
14.1 average. Graves also holds the eighth spot in
rebounding, the seventh spot in field goal percen-
tage, and the fourth-best free throw percentage.

Also in individual standings, Brian Hanson is
sixth in field goal percentage and ninth in con-
ference rebounding. Senior captain George Spears
leads the ODAC in free throw percentage making
60 of 70 attempts for an average of .857.

Canfield’s statement that
“ODAC basketball may not be
flawless, but it will be ex-
citing.”’

W&L committed 21 turnovers
and the Scots 16 in the mistake-
filled game. Maryville out-
scored the Generals over the
first four minutes of the second
half to take a 39-35 lead. But
Spears, who lead the squad with
16 points, scored five un-
answered points to give W&L a
45-43 lead with 11:41 remaining
and set the stage for an exciting
finish.

Maryville made a comeback
of their own and managed to
regain the lead at 55-52 with 5:12
left and 58-56 at the 2:38 mark.
Yates then made the first of two
defensive plays that swung the
game in the Generals’ favor.
Covering sharpshooter Bobby
Rimmer, he drew a charging
violation after the Generals had
committed one of their many:
turnovers, and then hit a
jumper from the left corner to
tie the contest at 58.

Following a Maryville travel-
ing call, Frank Eppes hit a turn-
around jumper from the
baseline to give W&L the lead
for good with only 1:26 left. Two
Spears’ tree throws at :36 seem-
ingly iced the victory. But Han-
son and Ken Jaffe missed the
front ends of one-and-ones, and
Maryville had a chance to force
overtime after rebounding
Jaffe’s miss with nine seconds
remaining.

But enter Yates once again.

Rimmer brought the ball
downcourt and was closely
guarded by the sophomore
guard. Hurried, he threw up a
desperation 18-footer at the
buzzer that missed everything.

“Billy (Yates) has been play-
ing our most intense defense,”’
said Canfield, who was also
upset at the amount of tur-
novers. ‘“‘When we create a tur-
nover situation, it disturbs me a
great deal. We must concen-
trate on not-causing our own
situation.”

The squad had opened the
week by suffering a 77-65 set-
back at the hands of Mary
Washington College. The Blue
Tide outrebound W&L 55-34, and
the Generals only shot 40%
from the floor. “It was a horren-
dous ball game which we
deserved to lose and Mary
Washington deserved to win,”
explained Canfield. ‘We were

their big game and we broke

down totally, both offensively
and defensively.

“We rushed, hurried and took
shots we shouldn’t have taken.
We don’t shoot well out of the
context of our offense. Also, the
crowd got into the game.”’

Canfield did praise his club,
however, in noting that they
never quit and cut what was
once a 24-point deficit down to
the final margin of 12 points.
“The fact that they bounced
back against Maryville showed
their strength,” he added.

Hanson led the team with 16
points, and Spears added 12.

by Rick Swagler

The term “recruiting’’ often
brings to mind rule violations
and NCAA-imposed probations.
This is mostly due to the
media’s virtually exclusive
coverage of rule violators, even
though most schools operate
honestly.

Recruiting practices at’
Washington and Lee vary from
sport to sport. Head Football
Coach Gary Fallon and Head
Lacrosse Coach Jack Emmer
refer to recruiting as a ‘‘con-
tinual process,’ whereas head
basketball coach Verne Can-
field says the time he spends
recruiting is ‘‘all jammed up.”’

Although the basketball
recruiting program consists
mostly of letters, cards, and
telephone calls, rather than per-
sonal visits, Canfield says, ‘‘If
he’s a really good kid, I’ll make
every effort to go see him no
matter where he is — unless
he’s on the West Coast or
something like that.”

The track recruiting program
is similar, with Coach Norris
Aldridge travelling mainly
within the state of Virginia to
talk to prospects.

Lacrosse, however, is a dif- ~
ferent story.

and intern Eric Kemp. The

5,500 miles, visit over 190
schools, and meet with 600 to 700
prospects. In addition, many
prospects will visit W&L and

spend a weekend with a W&L
student athlete.

As David Burst of the NCAA
states, “There are numerous
differences between Division I
and Division III.” Perhaps

those differences are best sum- .” |

med up by Ken Weller, presi-
dent of Central College. ‘‘It can
be claimed that, in general,
Division I institutions place a
greater emphasis on ‘societal’
objectives, whereas Division III
institutions concentrate on ‘par-
ticipant’ objectives.’

Fallon supports this, saying
“all our sports are a service to
the student body.”

Although W&L is a Division
III school, the lacrosse team
competes in Division I. Emmer
explains: ‘Our philosophy
hasn’t changed a bit; it’s a Divi-
sion III philosophy all the way,
except we aspire to play Vivi-
sion I lacrosse.” W&L’s most ef-
fective recruiting tool in
lacrosse, according to Emmer,
is its summer lacrosse camp.

. Last year, 12 players from the

camp decided to come to school
here.

The Division III recruiting
rules are fairly simple. Basical-
ly they state that no athletic
scholarships may be given, and
that coaches cannot talk with
players below the 12th-grade
level.

As Canfield says, ‘‘The first

thing we indicate to a kid is, ‘We
( can’t give you anything but a

chance to earn an education and
a chance to play.’ We refuse to

¥4 say anything more than that. If

that kid is looking for something

‘more, he shouldn’t come to
_ Washington and Lee.”

It is clear that in recruiting
players, Canfield is looking for

A someone who will be happy at

W&L. In fact, when a prospect

*\ visits W&L, Canfield turns him

over to the players. ‘‘I tell him
(the prospect), ‘Hey, if you
don’t like these guys, don’t
come to Washington and Lee.’
We’re very open, very honest,
very blunt.”

This honesty is also reflected
in the letters Canfield sends out.
He notes that ‘‘we have a letter
we'll send out saying ‘Thanks
for your interest, but there’s no
way you can qualify.’ It saves a
lot of heartbreak, and it’s fair to
the kid.”

Fallon also relies heavily on
student/athletes in recruiting.
He tells his players that ‘‘if they
want good people on our football
team, they have to be the real
salesmen. Because after a

Prospects Are

Just Not Going
To Walk Onto

The Campus

while, I’m sure we football
coaches all sound alike to a
prospect.’”’

Recruiting for a Division III
school is not trouble-free. Em-
mer compares the on-the-road
recruiting to “missionary work
— you wind up putting some of
your own bucks into the effort.’’

The size of the school can also
be a problem. While it is true
that the school’s small size
makes the university attractive
to many students, it also tends
to make it less visible, less
known.

As Emmer comments, ‘‘Pros-
pects are just not going to walk
onto the campus; they’re not
going to just show up. We’ve got
to go out and make sure they’re
aware of our lacrosse program,
our academic programs —
because they’re good ones —
and sell the university.”

Canfield commented on the
problem of competing for
players against schools which
offer athletic scholarships: ‘I
think you have to realize in
recruiting for Washington and
Lee that you’re not going to get
a blue-chip prospect. So you set-
tle for a super kid. We look for
special people who are willing
to work at the game, pay the
price, and work up to a certain
point...so when they graduate,
they’re about the best player
they can be.”’

Emmer voices a similar opi-
nion: “If you're trying to

recruit a guy who’s getting a
full ride (full scholarship) at
U.Va. and U.N.C.’ chances are

W&L Recruiting: Stress On ‘Participant Objectives’

that you’re not going to be com-
petitive — although we'll give it
our best shot and sell a good,
academic, personal universi-

None of the coaches inter-
viewed saw any problems with
the current Division III rules
and only Emmer suggested a
change. Emmer said that he
would like to see the NCAA
eliminate all on-the-road
recruiting. All recruiting under
Emmer’s suggestion would be
done by mail and by telephone
and through student visits to the
various campuses. Coach
Fallon opposed this suggestion,
saying ‘‘If you just left it all to
mailing and telephone calls, it
would become a very imper-
sonal thing. I think we would be
at a disadvantage... I really feel
our sports would suffer.’’

Of course the most important
facet of recruiting is the pro-
spect himself. In the course of
researching this. article, two
high school seniors currently
being recruited by W&L and a
W&L sophomore who was re-
cruited to play soccer were in-
terviewed. All three students
wished to remain anonymous.

The first prospect is being
recruited to run track by W&L,
U.Va. and William and Mary.
The recruit said that W&L
“didn’t really recruit” him. He
just stopped. by Norris
Aldridge’s office one afternoon
and Aldridge explained the pro-
gram to him.

When asked about the
possibilities of athletic scholar-
ships at other schools, the
recruit replied, “‘The coach at
William and Mary said that if I
would agree to go there — and if
I ran a 1:52 half-mile — he
would give me a full ride. That’s
bull st. If I decide to go to
William and Mary, I want a
scholarship before I start run-
ning.”

The recruit is not sure about
whether he wants a full ride or
not, though. “I don’t like the
pressure of an athletic scholar-
ship,” he said. “If you run a
couple of bad meets, your food
ticket gets cut.”

The recruit is still not sure
where he will end up. He ex-
plained his basis for making his
decision, though. “If I go to
U.Va., it will be because they
have such a good team; if I go to
W&L, it will be strictly for the
academics; if I go to William
and Mary, it’s because they’ll
give me a full ride.”’

The second prospect is being

 

recruited to run cross-country
and has been impressed with
Coach Dick Miller’s recruiting.
In fact, W&L was the only
school to send him information
on cross-countrybefore he ap-
plied.

The second recruit is apply-
ing to the University of
Virginia, and Yale in addition to
W&L. He says, ‘‘Nobody’s con-
tacted me from Virginia. After I
applied to Yale, I got a form
from their athletic department
to fill out and send back. Coach
Miller sent me a short letter and
an information card...he was
way ahead of the people .at
Yale.”

As another example, a
sophomore soccer player at
W&L was also contacted by
W&L’s athletic department
before he applied. He was con-
sidering the University of
Delaware, Bucknell, Muehlen-
berg College, and Haverford

College his senior year in col-
lege. He says he “‘had not even
thought about W&L.’’ Coach
Rolf Piranian, however, sent
him four letters and a catalogue
and W&L became his first
choice. In fact, he says, ‘Coach
Piranian was the deciding in-
fluence.”

Recruiting is a very

unpredictable part of athletics,
Money, academics, and size can
all play a big role in which
schools get which players. Even
after a prospect is enrolled, he
may not participate. As Coach
Miller says, ‘‘I don’t count on
anybody until they are suited-
up and running.”’

Swimmers Rise

by Andrew P. Hoppes

W&L’s swim team upped its
record to 3-4 over the weekend,
losing to Shippensburg State
and defeating William and
Mary.

In the 66-47 loss to Ship-
pensburg, the Generals lost the
400-yard medley relay, an event
they usually win. Mike Bernot,
forced by circumstances to
swim in an event he usually
does not swim, scored only
twice instead of his usual three
times.

Coach Page Remillard
pointed out two other factors
which contributed to Friday’s
loss. ‘‘We got beat by our finger-
nails a couple times despite the
fact we turned in some good
times.”’

Remillard also stated that
‘“‘we didn’t get the kind of per-
formances from our number-
two men that we should have.”

The Generals turned things
around against William and
Mary on Saturday with a con-
vincing 64-49 win. This time it

Wrestlers To Compete Head-to-Head |

by John Harrison

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team, which went 1-2
in last weekend’s competition,
will participate this Saturday in
the inaugural Davidson College
Invitational at Davidson, N.C.

Action in the eight-team event
begins at9 a.m.

“This Invitational will be a
new experience for us and a few
other teams,”’ said Head Coach
Gary Franke. ‘‘Most wrestling
tournaments feature head-to-
head competition by the in-
dividual athletes in each of the
ten weight classes. But this
event will use competition
among teams. There will not be
any weight classes titles.”’

The Generals will square off
against Catawba College in the
first-round. The victor of that
match will face the winner of
the Lynchburg College/Pfeiffer

was William and Mary’s, not
W&L’s, top swimmer who pick-
ed up points in only two events
while the Generals benefitted
from superb efforts from their
second men.

Mike Bernot’s outstanding
performance provided the most
exciting moments in the meet.
In the 400-yard medley relay,
Bernot made up substantial
time to pull out an exciting vic-
tory for W&L.

Bernot also posted firsts in
two other events in the meet.

One man whose contributions
often go unnoticed by the public
is Junior Bob Marshall. Mar-

shall, until this season a
freestyler, volunteered for
emergency service as_ the

Generals’ diver. Although new
to the event, Marshall con-
sistently scores one point in the
event and he also ‘‘adds an ele-
ment of motivation to the
team,’’ as Remillard noted.
‘He plays a significant role,”’
Remillard concluded.

This weekend the Generals

the loser will face the Lynch-

trants include Hampden-

“With the exception of
Barber-Scotia, these are the
same teams which participated
in our Invitational two weeks
ago,” said Franke. Catawba,
Elon and Pfeiffer finished first,
second and third, respectively,
in the W&L event. The Generals
earned fourth place.

W&L will be bringing a 2-5

‘‘We should be able to get our
record to. .500 this weekend,”
commented Remillard. ‘‘The
last two weeks have been
stressful. This week should not
be as tough.”’

With the National Champion-
ships now six weeks down the
road, the Generals have several
swimmers already qualified for
the event. Rand McClain, Tim
Rock and Bernot have all
qualified in individual events.
W&L’s 400-yard freestyle relay
team has also qualified for na-
tional competition.

Remillard sees Bernot as the
favorite to win the 50 and 100-
yard freestyles, although Ber-
not will have to defeat the
defending national champion.
‘‘He is capable of being a triple
winner in the NCAA’s,”’ said
Remillard. ‘‘No individual in
Division III has ever done that
before.”’

Freshmen Wes Payne in the
134-pound class and Greg Ken-
drick in the 167-pound division
picked up the wins over
Western Maryland. Payne,
Freshman Ron Thornton at 126,
captain Tim Valliere and
heavyweight Carlton Peebles
scored victories in the Loyola
meet.

Freshmen Jeff Dixon at 177 and
Joe O’Neill at 190 were vic-
torious against Delaware State.

People were all over Evans
Dining Hall as the band sang in-
to the wee hours of Sunday mor-
ning. At one end were the 120 or
so dancers who had been there
virtually the whole time since 8
p.m. on Friday.

In front of them, at the base of
the stage where the Drifters
crooned ‘‘Sing a Happy Song,”’
Jay Blumberg and Rhonda Dee
Adkins danced, too.

Their appearance may well
have gone unnoticed by most in
the crowd which was jammed
into the dark cafeteria-turned-
dance hall.

The pair was having a big
time, like the rest of the crowd

doing. For every hour danced,
every beer drunk, every admis-
sion paid, and for every pie to
hit a professor’s face was a lit-
tle more money to enter the
fight against Muscular
Dystrophy, the disease that
forces people like Rhonda Dee
Adkins to live their lives in
wheelchairs.

When the siren sounded for
the final time around 2 a.m.
Sunday, Tripp Brower, chair-
man of the Danceathon, was on
stage thanking everyone for
their help and to tell them — for
the 13th time — how much the
total had increased over the last
hour’s total.

The goal was $22,000. They

out doing what it«does most
weekends at Washington and
Lee — drink, dance, listen to
music, talk...Certainly
Blumberg’s  ear-to-ear grin
gave it away that he was enjoy-
ing himself.

But there was something a lit-
tle different about the two new
dancers — in the midst of all the
people who had danced for
nearly 30 hours was a girl ina
wheelchair.

Actually, their dancing could
hardly have been more ap-
propriate.

‘Dance for those who can’t,”
read one of the banners lining
the walls of the room. And
that’s what everyone there was

   

nm

raised nearly $24,000.

The money must still be col-
lected and expenses deducted,
but the bottom line is, as
Brower had said earlier, that a
little bit more will be going to
help those afflicted by M.D.

Blumberg, who organized the
first Superdances at W&L four
years ago, told the crowd Satur-
day afternoon that one day
Muscular Dystrophy will be
licked and there’ll be no need to
hold ‘‘superdances’’ to combat
it.

Until then, people will have to
continue dancing for and with
those like Rhonda Dee Adkins
as Blumberg did Saturday
night.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

The Resignation

Perhaps the greatest indication of the success of
Robert E.R. Huntley as president of Washington and
Lee was the shock and dismay which accompanied
the announcement of his resignation Monday. In an
age when universities are hard-pressed to meet both
financial and academic standards, President Huntley
provided W&L with both an outstanding fund-raising
program and revisions for the school’s curriculum.

As one professor indicated last Tuesday, the
average college president enters office and, within
‘he next five to six years, has generally screwed up
enough things to merit his resignation. The opposite
holds true for President Huntley. In his 14 years at the
helm, Washington and Lee has added a modern law
school, a modern library and a modern athletic facili-
ty. In addition, the school has renovated several
buildings along the Colonnade. And even though
President Huntley will leave office at the end of the
year, more improvements are on the way.

The university's board of trustees faces an in-
teresting choice. As President Huntley pointed out in
an interview with the Phi last Monday, the board can
choose either an administrator or a fund-raiser. With
the last decade having seen an emphasis on fund-
raising, perhaps the university will choose to spend
the next decade on improving the curriculum.

President Huntley was unique in that he was able to
handle both the academic and financial crises of this
school with precision. While he strove at all times to
meet the school’s financial needs, he never lost sight
of the value of the liberal arts education. In this
respect, the university will be fortunate to find a man
of equal talents.

Superdance '82

Superdance '82, Washington and Lee’s contribution
to the fight against muscular dystrophy, was a suc-
cess in more than one way. Financially, the super-
dance collected $2,000 more than it had projected. But
more importantly, Superdance '82 was an event en-
joyed by a majority of the campus.

Superdance ‘82 Chairman Tripp Brower and his
committee are to be commended for their efforts last
weekend. The people in the Superdance organization
pooled their resources to provide both the dancers
and spectators with outstanding entertainment for 30
continuous hours. Mr. Brower lived up to his boast
that Supernce '82 would be ‘W&L’s longest party.’

Credit for this success should certainly begin with
Mr. Brower and his committee, but should also be ex-
tended to all those people who danced and all those
people who supported the dancers. The Superdance
served as an example of how a community can join to
make an event a success. Besdies, how many times in
life does one get the chance to have a good time while
promoting a good cause”

1 Message to the Students of

Washington and Lee:

I want you to know of my deci-
sion to resign as President. For a
long time I have thought that a
college president should not re-
main in office indefinitely, and I
believe this is a good time in the
University’s life for a change to
occur. Some of my thinking is
contained in a letter I have just
sent to all Faculty and Alumni. |
am sending a copy of that letter
with this one to the Ring-tum
Phi.

The Board of Trustees is
establishing procedures to search
for my successor, and your views
and suggestions will be sought.

My most important source of
satisfaction during my years as a
teacher and administrator has
been observing the achievements
and successes of our students
while they are here and after they
leave us. My love for Washington
and Lee was born while 1 was here
as a student, and so it is also satis-
fying for me to observe how many
of our present students and young

alumni develop the same kind of
lasting affection for the Universi-
ty which has characterized
thousands of others over the
years.

Twill continue to serve as Presi-
dent until the end of 1982 and dur-
ing that time will have the oppor-
tunity to see and talk with many of
vou. Thereafter, Llook forward to
sharing with you the strong bond
which is common to alumni of
Washington and Lee.

Robert E.R. Huntley

 

 

Letters From The President

Dear Friends,

Please accept my apology for
the form of this letter — but there
is no convenient way for me to
communicate personally with all
of you.

Recently you should — have
received the January issue of the
Alumni Magazine announcing
the success of the Development
Program, a success attributable to
your generosity and hard work.
More than 86 percent of the funds
committed came from individual
alumni, faculty, and friends, The
astounding success of the pro-
gram is a mark of the vitality of
this old school and an unmis-
takable sign of the loyalty of those
who love it. We cannot regard our
University as secure, but we can
regard it as strong enough to ap-
proach the future boldly and
unafraid.

My purpose in writing to you
now is to tell you of my decision to
resign as president, effective at
the end of 1982. Perhaps this word
will not come as a great surprise to
most of you, especially to those
who have known me for some
time. When I became president,
fourteen years ago this week, it
seemed to me that a college presi-

Washington and Lee University

dent ought to set general objec-
tives he would like to see achieved
over a decade or so, and thereafter
should step aside. 1 believe that
usually it is better for a new per-
son to lead the institution into the
next cyele of its life.

This should be a good time in
our history for the school to seek
and obtain a new president. We
have just completed a decade-long
development: effort: successfully.
Our faculty is talented and
dedicated, our Board of Trustees
is uniquely strong, our alumni
and friends generous and
devoted, and we are increasingly
attracting able students in ade-
quate numbers. From such a posi-
tion of strength a change in the
presidency is best made. You will
be informed in the next Alumni
Magazine about the procedures
which the Board has established
to seek my successor, Certainly,
your views will be requested.
Meanwhile, you may wish to send
your suggestions to the Presiden-
tial Search Committee here.

From my personal viewpoint,
my love for Washington and Lee
is as great as ever, and Lam sure it
always will be. But, quite simply,

I do not leave this office

for us a mainstay, and for that we
are lastingly grateful.

Jan. 9 In The Pit
Root Boy Slim Joins The 80’s

From the Baltimore News-

American of July 18, 1980

We are living in strange
times: Wayne Newton, whose
voice used to sound like Mr.
Bill’s, has become a sex symbol
and the biggest draw in Vegas.
An old B-movie actor has
become president. Richard Nix-
on has become a_ multi-
millionaire by being a disgrace.
John Lennon went into the steer
business. Iran made America
look like a fat sissy and Jimmy
Carter’ his lips pouting,
wouldn’t light his Christmas
tree.

But the real shocker was
when I turned around on my
barstool at No Fish Today a few
nights ago and saw Root Boy
Slim looking downright respect-
able.

“The ’60s are over,” he said.

Gone was the tub of fat
around the belly, the scraggly
beard, the long, stringy hair
that hung like licorice down his
back. He’s lost weight and looks
slim, has replaced the beard
with an Errol Flynn moustache
and cut his hair. His shirt was
clean. He has taken to playing
chess.

“I’m quite good,’’ he says.

What’s the world coming to?
Has Root Boy Slim, the leader
of the old Sex Change Band,
mellowed? Has he turned
Republican or found Jesus or
what?

‘Don’t you believe it,” he
growled, slipping back into the
Root Boy Slim persona. “I’m
still as vile and tasteless as
ever. You'll see Saturday
night.”

Root Boy Slim will bring his
svelte, clean-cut body, his new
band, and his old debauchery
into the Marble Bar Saturday
night at 9:30.

“TI am looking for Jesus,’’. he
said. ‘“‘He owes me money.”

Slim did not join Wayne
Newton in singing ‘‘God Bless
America” at the Republican
Convention. ‘Republican? I’m
not even a Democrat,” he says.
“I’m a registered meterologist.
I think it’s Reagan behind (the
heat wave). It’s moved here
from Detroit.”’

 

Will representa-
tives for the
Cadaver Society
and the Sons of
Liberty Hall
please contact the
Calyx in Carole
Chappell’s office
before Friday,
Feb. 12th.

 

 

 

No, the stage version of Root
Boy Slim is as outrageous as
ever, but the man behind it has
toned down considerably, says
his manager, Joe Lee. ‘‘No
more staying up for nine days,”’
Lee said. Slim turned 36 this
week, and looks as if he’s going
tostick around for a while.

Root Boy Slim, born Foster
Mackenzie III, is the son of a
golf-course architect, a Yale
graduate, and a man who was
paid $40,000 by Warner Bros. to
leave the company after mak-
ing one legendary album. He
writes and performs such songs
as ‘‘Boogie ‘til You Puke,” (You
Broke My) Mood Ring,”’ ‘“‘The
Shah Is Gone,” and “Bride of
the Burro.”’

He acts like a one-man cast of
“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest” on stage, rolling around
the floor, screaming for Brooke
Shields. He’s very believable

and very funny. And very’

smart. He knows that people
will pay to see a freak show. I
asked him if he would ever do
straight blues. ‘‘It just wouldn’t
sell,”’ he said.

This is not to say that Root
Boy Slim is a complete act. He
is a little different. I will never
forget the time I interviewed
him at his sleazy apartment in
Silver Spring. On that day his
body was a chemistry set of
controlled, dangerous substanc-
es. He talked me into discussing
the interview over a Szechuan
dinner, which, of course, I paid
for. Slim is perpetually broke.

He ordered lobster Szechuan,
the most expensive thing on the
menu, and several Zombies, the
most expensive drink on the
menu, and started raving about
how he was going to put a con-
tract out on Charlie McCollum
of the Washington Star for print-

ing something derogatory to his
musical ability. I drove him to
his place, where he got out of
the car, leaned over a dumpster
and promptly disgorged the
lobster Szechuan.

He then made a cocaine run,
snorting the white powder up
like a pig rooting for truffles,
and collapsed on the couch.

“‘Lawd, have MER-CY!”’ he
howled.

A few hours later, he stag-
gered onto the stage somewhere
in Frederick and actually per-
formed. I played the interview
back on the tape recorder and
heard a weird, mumbling rap
about basketball, interspersed
with sudden gospel-music
shrieks that would take the
hairs off James Brown’s chest.

The next few times our paths
crossed, he and his ‘band rang
up a $200 bar bill at the Childe
Harold in Washington and more
than $100 at the Marble Bar. He
ended the latter night by danc-
ing in a pair of soiled red boxer
shorts on top of the bar. Then
Slim went to England, did a tour
did not get paid royalties for an
album called Zoom on an ap-
‘propriately named label called
Illegal, and fired his band.

‘Actually, I fired myself,’’ he
said. He wanted to cut down on
the band’s expenses, he said,
and wanted a change. His new
band is now Cryin’ Out Loud,
featuring Ronnie Holloway, a
saxophonist from his old band.

He has been rehearsing with
the band — something he rarely
did before — and it is supposed
to be tighter and funkier than
the Sex Change Band, although
the Marble Bar date is only
their second show together. You
can find out who the real Root
Boy Slim is Saturday night. But
mammas, you'd better lock up
your daughters that night just
in case,

Within six years, he had been
promoted to full professor.

In 1968, Huntley was named
dean of the law school. He held
that position only one semester
before being elected president
of the university, succeeding
Dr. William W. Pusey III, who
had been acting president
following the resignation of Dr.
Fred C. Cole in 1967.

Huntley is a member of Phi

the failing King’s oneness with
himself and the blighted land.
(The Grail is the goblet from
which it is believed that Christ
drank at the Last Supper and in

which, it is said, Christ’s blood
was caught at the Crucifixion. )
The focus of the film is
Lancelot’s conviction that his il-
licit love for Guinevere, Ar-
thur’s queen, is the reason he

has failed in his search for the
Grail. He concludes that they

“must renounce each other, but

Guinevere refuses to deny the
importance of their passion.
She suggests a different reason
for Lancelot’s failure to find the
Grail, and in doing so, implies
that presumptuousness is
behind the quintessential quest
of the Middle Ages: ‘“‘It was not
the Grail, it was God you sought
— and God is not a trophy you
can bring home.”’

MEMOREX

ii Quality Audio Recording Tape
Hi Bias Special —

The movie also offers a criti-
que of Arthur’s. knightly
chivalric ideal. The word
“chivalry” is derived from
“cheval,” which in French
means ‘“‘horse.’’ Riderless
horses signal the end of Ar-

thur’s vision. The soldiers of
Morded, Arthur’s bastard son,
unmounted and in light, flexible
armor, pile Arthur’s knights in-
to a heap of scrap metal, the
victims ultimately of their own

imprisoning and dehumanizing
armor.

We take great pleasure in an-
nouncing that the next movie to
be shown by the Film Society is
Man of Marble (1979), by the
Polish director Andrzej Wajda
