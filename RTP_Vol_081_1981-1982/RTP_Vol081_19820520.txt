Plus/Minus

by John Cleghorn

‘Under new university rules, a
Washington and Lee student
will be able to conceivably
graduate with a 4.33 grade
average.

In a new grading system that
will take effect in September
1983, plus and minus notations
will be added to grades which
deserve such clarification. A
plus will add .33 to the grade-
point and a minus will subtract
.33 from the grade given for a
course. Thus an A plus will be
marked 4.33 and an A- 3.67.

The motion passed in the May
faculty meeting after a study
done by the Committee on
Courses and Degrees. Before
the faculty review of the mo-

Under the present grading
system, a low grade is given the

changes that condition to reflect
the student’s work more exact-
ly. Where B minus work would
receive three grade points, it
will recieve 2.67 grade points

Students Kicked Out Of Twin Falls

by Scott Mason

Eighteen Washington and Lee
undergraduate students were
issued summonses to appear in
court after allegedly trespass-
ing on private property located
at the Twin Falls area.

At approximately 3 p.m. on
Thursday, May 13, the 18
students ventured to Twin
Falls, a large swimming hole
situated about six miles from
the W&L campus. Once there,
the group began swimming at a
spot below the falls’ cliffs when,
shortly thereafter, a man and
two Rockbridge County Deputy
Sheriffs appeared.

According to Alexander
Campbell, a’ W&L sophomore
and member of the group, the

complaintant, Carey S. Mackey
of R.F.D. 1 in Buena Vista, told
the boys that they were
trespassing on private proper-
ty. Mackey then indicated that
he had posted two ‘‘no trespass-
ing” notices on the grounds.
Campbell has since claimed,
however, that the signs were
camouflaged by foliage and
none of the group members had
noticed them.

Mackey, Campbell claims,
told the boys that several
students from the Virginia
Military Institute had, the
previous afternoon, been swim-
ming naked and caused a
general stir. Campbell said that
Mackey claimed that one of the
Keydets had engaged in sexual

intercourse on Mackey’s land,

“We are victims of cir-
cumstance,’’ Campbell said.
“The incident of the previous
day provoked such action. We
are merely being used as an ex-
ample.”

Court date is set for Fri., May
21 and, said Campbell, ‘I am
going to plead ‘not guilty.’ ’”’ In
addition to the signs having
been inadequately posted,
Campbell claims that people
have been swimming at Tein
Falls for years without any pro-
blems.

Mackey could not be reached

for comment.
Six VMI students received

summonses for trespassing the
following day.

 

System Adopted University Celebrating

Fund-Raising Success

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity will celebrate the success of
its recently-completed $67-
million development program
with a series of events on the
campus this weekend (May 21
‘and 22) coinciding with the.
‘spring meeting of the universi-
ty’s board of trustees.

At 4p.m. on Friday (May 21),
there will be a ceremony in Lee
Chapel featuring remarks by
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Lewis F. Powell Jr., a trustee
emeritus of Washington and
Lee; James M. Ballengee of
Philadelphia, Pa., rector of the
university’s board of trustees;
and, Robert E.R. Huntley,

president of the university.

On Saturday (May 22) at
11:30 a.m., John P. Fishwick,
former president of the Norfolk
& Western Railway Company,
will be the principal speaker at
dedication ceremonies for the
Commerce School Building.

Formerly the  university’s
library building, the Commerce
School Bulding was renovated
and remodeled at a cost of $3.5
million in 1979-80 after W&L had
moved into its new  under-
graduate library building.

The Commerce School Butid-

‘ing is the home of the universi-

ty’s School of Commerce,
Economics, and Politics.

Electrician Hospitalized
After Receiving Shock

by Jehn Cleghorn

An electrician was hospital-
ized with minor burns Friday
after he was shocked by a 7200-
volt power line.

Phillip Sutphin, 26, an em-
ployee of Southeastern Electric
in Roanoke, received the shock
when he accidentally cut into
the power line. The mishap,
which took place around 11:30
a.m. Friday morning, happened
in a manhole just south of the
University Library and near
Reid Hall. Underground power
lines were being prepared at
that time to be shut off the next
day for repairs.

A volunteer rescue squad ar-
rived approximately 20 minutes
after the incident and took the
victim to Stonewall Jackson:

Hospital. sutphin was stabilized
in Lexington before he was
transferred to Roanoke to be
treated for minor burn damage.

The work being done was part
of a project completed last
weekend to replace faulty
power lines on both the north
and south ends of the campus.
Two weeks ago, the lines on the
south end were replaced and
electricity was off seven hours
Saturday as the north-end lines
were installed.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Plus/Minus

In a move that is believed to make the university’s
grading system more comparable to those of other
schools, the faculty of Washington and Lee has ap-
proved a measure that places “‘plus’’ and ‘“‘minus”’
notations on certain grades.

The argument in favor of the move is that plus and
minus grading would give officials at other schools a
better understanding of the student’s work. This, in
theory, would help a W&L student when he is applying
for a graduate school. But does this really give the
student such an advantage?

Under the new system, the difference between a
plus and a minus grade is only one-third of a grade-
point per credit. If a student were taking a three
credit course, for example, the difference between a
C plus and a B- would be minimal in figuring out the
grade point average. Where the difference between a
C plus and a B- was once three grade points, it will
now be only one point. The effort to make a B- rather
than a C plus will likely be a matter of pride, more
than anything else.

The system does have its rewards, however. By
finishing with a ‘‘plus’ mark, the student will get
more points than he previously did. This makes the A’
plus, for example, especially gratifying. But by get-
ting an A-, the student is penalized a third of a grade
point. The system thus has its own plusses and
minuses. While it rewards good work, it contains a
few pitfalls that cause almost unfair losses of grade
points.

The university had the right idea in trying to make
its grading system compatible to ther schools. Let’s
hope the idea doesn’t backfire.

Alumni Awards Presented

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity conferred Distinguished
Alumnus Awards upon award-
winning journalist Parke S.
Rouse Jr. of Williamsburg, Va. ;
attorney James D. Sparks of
Monroe, La.; and, Staunton,
Va., businessman Arch Sproul
III during the Alumni Reunion
activities last weekend.

Selected by the board of
directors of the W&L Alumni
Association, the awards were
announced at the annual
meeting of the Alumni Associa-
tion in Lee Chapel on Saturday,
May 8.

Rouse is a 1937 graduate of
Washington and Lee where he
served as editor of the student
newspaper, president of the
publications board and vice
president of the Virginia Col-
legiate Press Association.

From 1937 to 1950, Rouse
worked as a reporter and editor
for the Newport News Daily
Press and the Richmond Times-
Dispatch, winning several
awards for editorial and feature
writing.

A former director of public
relations for the Virginia
Chamber of Commerce, Rouse
was executive director of
Virginia’s 350th Anniversary
Commission and then became
executive director of the
Jamestown-Yorktown Founda-

tion, a position he held until his
retirement in 1980.

He is the author of 15 books,
including ‘The Great Wagon
Road;” ‘Roll, Chesapeake,
Roll;” “Virginia: The English
Heritage;” and ‘Virginia: A
Pictorial History.’’ He is cur-
rently a contributing editor for
the Newport News Daily Press.

The citation presented to
Rouse noted that he “‘has writ-
ten about his alma mater for na-
tional publications and has, by
his testimony as well as his
achievement, presented
Washington and Lee’s strengths
to the world.”’

Sparks received his law
degree from the Washington
and Lee University School of
Law in 1932.

After establishing a law prac-
tice in his native Louisiana,
Sparks volunteered for World

. War II naval service, serving

with distinction in torpedo
squadrons aboard two aircraft
carriers, primarily the U.S.S.
Yorktown. He left the Navy
with the rank of lieutenant com-
mander, but his lifelong devo-
tion to his service and his ship
led.him to the honor of being
chairman of the board of the
U.S.S. Yorktown Foundation.
Following the war, he became
a successful lawyer, with the
Monroe firm of Thompson,
Sparks & Cudd, an active

businessman, and an undefeat-
ed state senator in Louisiana.
He has been involved with
Washington and Lee through his
participation on several alumni
committees.

Sproul, who graduated from
Washington and Lee in 1937,
was cited for his ‘‘distinguished
record of achievement and
leadership in military service,
the world of business, civic af-
fairs, and education.”

In addition to 28 years with
the Virginia National Guard
and as last commander of the
famed 29th “Blue and Gray,”
Sproul served five years on ac-
tive duty during World War II
and an additional five years on
regular Army duty attending

‘schools and conferences. He

commanded Assault Company
in the 116th Infantry Regiment
on Omaha Beach, for which he
received the Distinguished Ser-
vice Cross.

In 1966 Sproul organized the
Virginia International Com-
pany, which is involved with the
development of oil and gas pro-
duction in Indonesia.

Sproul’s leadership in civic
activities, which include the
Chamber of Commerce, United
Fund, and the Woodrow Wilson
Foundation, prompted his
selection in 1954 as Man of the
Year for Augusta County and
Staunton.

Library Receives Book Collection

A Baltimore, Md., couple has
given the Washington and Lee
University Library an impor-
tant collection of almost 1,200
books and exhibition catalogs
concerning late 19th-and early
20th-century art.

Ellen and Alvin Aisenberg
presented the books which they
collected over the past 30 years.
Mr. Aisenberg is an alumnus of
Washington and Lee.

A selection of books from the
Aisenberg Collection is current-
ly on display in the Boatwright
Rare Book Reading Room in the
University Library. The display
is open to the public from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Monday through Fri-
day.

A bibliography of the collec-
tion, edited by Richard W.
Oram and Priscilla B. Lewis of
the library staff, is available at
no charge.

Approximately one quarter of
the Aisenberg Collection is com-
posed of works on French artist
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. The
collection includes a_ multi-
volume catalog of his complete
drawings and an _ extensive
group of critical works and
biographies of Lautrec.

“This collection is by no
means a survey of the history of
modern art,’”’ Mr. and Mrs,
Aisenberg wrote in describing
their gift. “It is rather a per-
sonal collection which stresses

those figures. which have.

especially appealed to us:
Lautrec’ Degas, Schiele and
Modigliani.

“We feel that it has sufficient
depth to stimulate those
students involved in research;
it should also be useful to those
who are simply interested in ex-
amining exhibition catalogs of
their favorite artists.”

University Librarian Maurice
D. Leach Jr. said that the
Aisenbergs’ gift ‘‘adds a
distinguished _ reference
resource to the University
Library. Each member of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty is indebted to them for shar-
ing with us this very carefully
selected and rich collection.”

Paintings On Display

Pobai Hefelfinger will be on

SPE’s, FIJI’s Receive
Fines For May 8 Melee

by John Cleghorn

Washington and Lee students
Russell Rosler and Drew Clark
appeared in Lexington General
District Court Tuesday on
counter charges of destruction
of property.

Judge Joseph Hess fined
Clark $100 on each of three
counts and Rosler on one count.
Clark also received a ten day
sentance which was suspended
and is responsible for paying
resttution to Rosler.

The charges are a result of a
clash that took place on May 8
in the yards of the Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Phi Gamma Delta
fraternities.

The Interfraternity Council

also reviewed the incident Tues-
day in its meeting. After hear-
ing testimony form the involved
parties, the council ruled to,
place Phi Gamma Delta on)
social probation beginning Oct.
8.

** It was basically a SPE/Figi
incident,’’ remarked IFC Presi-
dent Mason Ellerbe. ‘‘There are
always individuals involved but
it was fraternity related.’’

‘There had been another inci-
dent in the fall between the two
houses which received an in-
definite penalty,’’ added
Ellerbe explaining the severity
of the penalty. ‘“‘That was aj
large consideration we took in|
making our decision.”

 

 

 

Fitzgerald is considering a
‘‘rejuvenation’’ of the
“Southern Collegian,” a lam-
poon. If the publication returns
to the campus, it will be the
sixth student publication.

In other business, Junior
Representative John Vlahoplus
announced that an open forum
on Rush will be sponsored
tonight at 7:00 in the Universi-

EC Hears Contact, Calyx

ty’s Northen Auditorium.

Vlahoplus stated that the pur-
pose of the forum is to ‘clear up
the confusion” about next
year’s Rush and “‘to get sugges-
tions” for next fall’s orientation
program. Dean Dan Murphy
and IFC President Mason
Ellerbe will be featured at the
forum and béer and alternative
beverages will be served.

Don’t Allow The Sun To Set
On WEL Division I Lacrosse

by Bruce Potter

As the sun set behind Wilson Field last Satur-
day, a solitary jogger was plodding his way
around the track, still neatly lined from the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference track champion-
ships.

His footsteps echoed in the now-empty stands
that three hours previously had been packed with
fans cheering Washington and Lee to a 19-8
lacrosse victory over the University of Maryland
in Baltimore County.

Back on the field, the lacrosse nets had been
removed, and the football goalposts, glistening in
the day’s last light, seemed to have regained their
prominence. The only memories of a recently-
completed lacrosse season were the restraining,
mid-field and out-cf-bounds lines and the areas
at midfield and the goals where the grass had long’
disappeared.

As the Generals lacrosse team closed their 13th
consecutive winning season with a 9-4 record, one
question that may become a topic of debate during
the hot, summer months is whether or not the sun
has set on Division I lacrosse at Washington and
Lee.

Now, this is not to imply that W&L should sud-
denly begin awarding athletic scholarships, a
disastrous move that would drastically alter the
character of the university.

Nor should the Generals drop to Division III in
lacrosse. But many discusions will be held on this
subject, especially after the humbling W&L
received from the University of Virginia and their
use of a slowdown offense to avoid a similar troun-
cing from the University of North Carolina.

And those who want to see Division III lacrosse
at Washington and Lee will be well-armed with
many other arguments.

For example, the Generals have not made the
NCAA playoffs for three of the last four years, and
their last decent showing in that prestigious event
came in 1975, when they advanced to the semi-
finals for the third straight year before losing to
Maryland.

Since then, the Generals have been drubbed by
Cornell twice, 14-0 in 1976 and 12-2 in 1978. They
also lost to Maryland in 1977 by a 14-8 count, and to
Syracuse in 1980 by a score of 12-4.

The last time a Washington and Lee team lost
less than four games in a season came in 1974,
when they entered the NCAA playoffs with a
spotless record before bowing to Johns Hopkins
11-10 in the semifinals.

Yet, the major argument in favor of remaining
in Division I in lacrosse is that there are con-
sistently three or four teams (UNC, UVA, Johns
Hopkins, and normally Maryland or Cornell),
that, barring upsets and “‘Armadillos,’’ rank one
step above the rest. And it is into this category that
Washington and Lee currently falls, along with the
Navys, Syracuses, Rutgers, Towson States,
Massachusetts, and Adelphis.

To post a 9-4 record playing against Division I
scholarship opponents is no mean feat in itself. To
do so without giving scholarships and with str-
ingent admission requirements is something else
altogether.

True, given the choice of attending North
Carolina on a full scholarship or W&L, where only
financial aid is available for those who can prove
they qualify, the average top prospect will have no
problem in picking the Heels.

But as long as W&L plays Division I lacrosse,
head coach Jack Emmer can tell a potential
recruit that the Generals face virtually the same
schedule as most of the top schools and don’t have
to sacrifice academics to do it.

Also favoring Division I lacrosse at Washington
and Lee is the fact that, currently, lacrosse is the
only sport that garners a significant amount of
campus interest. This may be due to the fact that
the season coincides with Spring term, but, more
likely, it is because everyone enjoys watching the
Generals battle, and sometimes defeat, the best
lacrosse teams in the nation. Who doesn’t like an
underdog?

Emmer has been quoted in the media as saying
that he feels there is some campus sentiment
towards switching to Division III to lacrosse. If so,
it has yet to manifest itself.

However, with the conclusion of this year’s cam-
paign, a meeting will be held among Emmer,
athletic director Bill McHenry, President Hunt-
ley, and the faculty athletic committee to, in Em-
mer’s words, ‘‘evaluate the thing (lacrosse pro-

Freshman Sandy Brown eludes U.M.B.C.’s Craig Tucker to fire a

 

shot at goalie Tim Murphy in Saturday’s action.

by John Harrison

In the season finale for both
schools, the Washington and
Lee lacrosse team handily
dispatched Maryland-Balti-
more County 19-8 Saturday in
front of 1,900 Wilson Field fans.

The Generals took a 6-0 lead
in the first ten minutes with the
help of two goals by freshman
Jeff Mason and were never
pressured after that.

Other key contributors for
W&L were starting goaltender
Phil Aiken (who allowed just
five goals and sixteen shots in
three quarters), John Doub and
senior Rob Staugaitis. Doub’s
six goals fell one short of W&L’s
single-game record.

Staugaitis closed out his
career with a pair of assists and
a goal. The two assists gave him
36, the fourth straight season he
has led the team in that
category. Perhaps even more
impressive was the at-
tackman’s four-year total of
119, which places him second on
the alltime W&L list behind Don
Carroll’s 129 (1973-1977).

said head coach Jack Emmer.

UMBC played without its
leading scorer, sophomore mid-
fielder Mark Gold, who was out
with an undisclosed injury.

“It was a surprise Gold didn’t
play,” said Emmer, “‘but we’ve
been through that (injury)
situation, too. Without their top
player, the Retrievers were
“sloppy. They didn’t show the
capability they did to play
Virginia 9-8,” added the coach.

Even though the Generals did
not receive a bid to the NCAA
tournament, Emmer was ex-
tremely pleased with the team’s
ability to cope with one of the
most ambitious schedules in
W&L history.

“People were worried about
us being competitive. It was a
real good year, finishing 9-4
when most people were picking
us for 4-9.”

Beyond the record itself, the
coach was equally satisfied
with the team’s attitude and its
ability to play as a unit.

“It left a positive feeling. Our
kids gave us a good effort all the
way down the line. We really
worked together as a team,’’ he
pointed out.

“It was a pleasure to be
associated with them. This was
as good as any team I’ve
worked with,” said Emmer,

Going Out On A Limb
Predictions, Prognostications For ’82-’83

by G. Bruce Potter

As this school year moves rapidly
towards a close, let’s gaze into our crystal
ball and take a month-by-month look at
what will take place in the world of
Washington and Lee sports next year:

September

In order to avoid being hit in the face
with a cream pie at the Muscular
Dystrophy Superdance, football coach
Gary Fallon decides that his team will not
have to undergo the tortuous ‘‘circuits”’
this season. Another factor in his decision
is that all of his senior quarterbacks have
graduated, so the pie would not be in-
tercepted.

Realistically, though, this may be the
year for Washington and Lee football.
Coming off an 8-2 record last year, the
team appears to be even stronger
(especially after spending all winter in the
weight room), and they will play their two
main ODAC rivals, Randolph-Macon and
Hampden-Sydney, at home.

October

The Generals cross-country team com-
plained about the actions of several Lyn-
chburg spectators in a meet at Lynchburg
last year. Well, Lynchburg comes to W&L
for a meet this year and head coach Dick
Miller re-routes the cross-country trail
through the freshman quad, so the Hornets
have extreme difficulty in dodging
lacrosse balls, frisbees, and beer bottles.

Afterwards, a reporter asks coach
Miller what his team did to win the race.
Miller’s response? ‘‘We ran faster than
they did.”’

November

After losing only one senior to gradua-
tion from last year’s 31-5 squad, the water
polo team finishes the regular season as
undefeated Southern League champions.
They manage to advance all the way to the
national finals (this is Division I,
remember) before losing to, you guessed
it, Slippery Rock State College of Penn-
sylvania.

December

As Washington and Lee opens its long-
awaited basketball campaign by winning
its first three games by a total of four
points and then losing two in a row before
going home for Christmas, the Ring-tum
Phi learns that Roanoke College has come
under investigation from the NCAA.

The Maroons, who finished in the top
eight in the nation in Division ITI last year,
appear stronger than ever, and four of
their five starters are freshmen or
sophomores. However, according to an all-
county guard from New York who signed
with Roanoke and then did not make the
squad, an alumnus offered him $1000.00
and a Hollins girl for attending this
esteemed institution of higher education.

January

Without eight-time all-American Mike
Bernot, who graduated, Page Remillard’s
swimming team is going nowhere fast this
year, and the wrestling team continues to
perform fairly well in relative mediocrity.

The only sure prediction that can be
made about January is that it will snow
and buildings and grounds will do their

The Ring-tum Phi, May 20, 1982, Page 5

usual poor job of keeping all the walkways
clear.
February

The Generals close their basketball
season or sO everyone assumes, with a
78-71 loss to Maryville in the opening round
of the Old Dominion Athletic Conference
tournament. The game ends with a Frank
Eppes’ dunk at the buzzer.

However, even though the squad has on-
ly posted a 15-11 record, the NCAA Divi-
sion III selection committee feels bad
about overlooking them for last year’s
tournament and selects the Generals for
this season’s championship tourney.

In related news, Roanoke is placed on a
two-year probation by the NCAA (no
televised games and no NCAA playoff ap-
pearances) for six recruiting violations.
However, the Maroons counter by apply-
ing for and receiving permission to move
to Division I in basketball.

March

Three years ago, Mike Schuler slammed
his finger in a door in a Baltimore hotel
room. Two years ago, Mike Pressler sat on
a defective chair and ended up with a six-
inch splinter in his posterior. Last year,
back up goalie Mark Lukes was hit in the
neck with a lacrosse ball and missed the
rest of the season. The only question that
remains for this year is which member of
the lacrosse team will be injured and what
form the freak injury will take.

Meanwhile, the Washington and Lee
basketball team is a surprise participant
in the NCAA Division III final four *Under

the motivation of head coach Verne Can-
field, the Generals have rebounded from
an unexpectedly sluggish season to finish
on a high note.

The W&L golf team wins all six dual

track team this year, and they come
through by winning ODAC champion-
ships...

And in lacrosse...

May

The Generals move quietly along to their
usual (at least in the last few years) 8-4
record.

Quietly, that is, except for one incident.
When the University of Virginia visits
Wilson Field, Emmer has a trick up his
sleeve. First, he places noted par-
ticipatory journalist George Plimpton in
the goal, and then he comes up with a new,

‘Scapino’ And Spaghetti Mix Well

The chef for Washington and Lee’s ‘Spaghetti Theatre,’’ Robert J.
de Maria, prepares his specialty for the nightly performance of
**Scapino” at the Troubadour Theatre.

Short story writer Peter Taylor, center, Commonwealth Professor

magazine.

 

thanks to the culinary talents of
Robert J. de Maria, an assistant
professor of journalism at
W&L.

‘‘Scapino,”’ directed by W&L
journalism instructor Paula
Langdon, is set in an Italian
restaurant in Naples during the
1950s.

In efforts to make the setting
as realistic as possible, the
theatre enlisted de Maria’s ser-
vices.

The result is what has been
labeled ‘‘Spaghetti Theatre.”

Each evening’s performance
of ‘‘Scapino”’ begins with a gen-
uine Italian dinner prepared by
de Maria and served on the set
of the play.

Since the configuration of the
theatre has had to be adapated
to a dinner-theatre format, at-
tendance for ‘“‘Scapino” has
been limited to about 50 for each
performance.

But for all those who were
unable to get a seat, there may
be one way to enjoy at least part
of the ‘‘Spaghetti Theatre’ ex-
perience — that is, to cook the
spaghetti.

To that end, the following is
the recipe for ‘‘de Maria’s Sun-
day Sauce’’:

de MARIA’S
“SUNDAY SAUCE”
1 tbs. oregano
1 tbs. sweet basil
1 tsp. fennel seed
1 tsp. crushed red pepper
salt & pepper to taste
grated Parmesan cheese
2 cloves of garlic (crushed)
1/4 cup olive oil
2 large cans tomatoes (20 0z
ea.)
16 0z. can tomato paste
12 oz. red wine
1/2 onion diced
11b. pork
In a large sauce pan, put olive
oil and add fennel, garlic, basil,
red pepper, onion. Add tomato
and cook over low heat. Allow to
simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.
Cover and cook for 1 to 2 hours,
stirring at regular intervals.
After 2 hours, add tomato paste
and wine and cook uncovered
for 30 minutes, then add pork
(or other meat as your palate
dictates). Add meatballs (see
recipe below) and cook until
thick. This sauce is better when
served one day later after ‘ag-
ing’ overnight.
MEATBALLS
1 lb. ground beef
1/2 lb. ground pork
legg
1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup olive oil
Put ingredients in a bowl, then
add 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp.
oregano, 1 tsp. sweet basil, 1/2
tsp. crushed red pepper, and 1/2
tsp. fennel seed. Mix together
until blended, then form into
small meat balls. Fry in oil until
lightly brown on all sides. Add
sauce. Enjoy.

under the upcoming plan.

The Committee listed four
chief reasons for the
changeover. First, the Commit-
tee report stated that ‘‘with 13
grades rather than five, there
can be a more accurate reflec-
tion as to the quality of the stu-
dent’s work.”’

Second, the report maintains
“‘the student owuld benefit by a
distinction between high and
low in the same grade-letter
range.”

The committee also endorsed
the system because it is used on
a national level. Finally, the
report reads that the system
will enable students to be com-
pared more directly to other
students in applying to law
school as the Law School Data
Assembly Service also
recognizes the plus and minus
system,

The faculty asked the Courses

and Degrees Committee to
study the proposal in the April

Winter term grades. A study
done five years earlier of a plus-
minus system was revised and
passed in the May faculty
meeting.

given in connection with the
eighth annual Medical Ethics
Institute.

Childress, who joined the
faculty of the University of

a 1981 book, ‘‘Priorities in
Biomedical Ethics,’’ which won
the 1981 Phi Beta Kappa Award
at the University of-Virginia.

does not conduct credit-
granting academic programs in
the summer, the university has
steadily been expanding the use
of its facilities and staff during
the summer months.

Included among the 13 dif-
ferent programs scheduled for
the W&L campus this summer
are two new ventures — an
alumni college and an elder-
hostel.

The inaugural session of the
W&L Alumni College will be
held June 27 through July 3 and
will involve 100 participants —
W&L alumni and their families

— in what is described as “a
week of reading, relaxation,
recreation, and reflection.”’

The theme for the Alumni Col-
lege is “Changing Views in
Changing Times.’’ Fure is the
program director while Sidney
M.B. Coulling, professor of
English at W&L, is the
academic director and Laura
de Maria is the director of the
junior program for the children
in attendance.

The faculty for the Alumni
College will be composed of
W&L professors Coulling, John
R. Handelman (politics),
Leonard E. Jarrard (psychol-
ogy), William A. Jenks
(history), and Thomas G. Nye
(biology).

In addition to daily lectures
and discussion groups, the par-
ticipants will be offered a varie-
ty of recreational opportunities
as well as optional learning pro-
grams that range from a ses-
sion on computers to classes in
photography, cooking, and
Chinese brush painting.

Noted author Tom Wolfe,

whose book “‘The Right Stuff”
will be one of the texts under
discussion, will make a presen-
tation to the college one even-
ing. Wolfe is a graduate of
W&L.

The other summer program
that is new this year at
Washington and Lee is the
elderhostel, part of a national
program designed for persons
60 years of age and over.

To be held from August 1

through August 7, W&L’s
elderhostel will involve 45 par-
ticipants who will take non-
credit courses to be taught by
Washington and Lee professors

Gerard Doyon (art), Robert
Stewart (music), and J.
Timothy Phillips (law).

Washington and Lee is one of
more than 500 colleges and
universities offering elderhostel
programs, which provide low-
cost, short-term residential
academic programs for older
adults.

Aside from the new offerings
on the agenda for this summer,
two of the programs are return-

ing for a second year after suc-
cessful beginnings last sum-
mer.

The Institute for Executives,
scheduled for June 13 through
June 26, will have an estimated
36 middle-level business ex-
ecutives who will be engaged in
two weeks of intense study in
the humanities.

Summer Scholars ’82,
scheduled for July 4 through Ju-
ly 30, is a month-long program
of rigorous, college- -level
academic work for students
who will be seniors in high
school this fall. The coeduca-
tional program is designed to
give college-bound high school
students an opportunity to sam-
ple college life.

The other programs on
Washington and Lee’s summer
schedule are athletic camps in
both lacrosse and basketball,
the National Institute for Trial
Advocacy’s Trial Practice
Clinic, the Rockbridge Schools
Fine Arts Workshop, the
American Academy of Judicial

Education conference, and a
