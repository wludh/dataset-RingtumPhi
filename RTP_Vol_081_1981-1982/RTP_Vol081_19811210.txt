Focus Plans A Monthly Paper

Outing Club Finally Attends Ex. Com. Meeting

by Todd Smith

A monthly 12-page newspaper
is planned for next term to deal
with intellectual topics, Focus
leaders reported to the Ex-
ecutive Committee Monday
night.

Focus, formerly the Intellec-
tual Symposium, will publish
the newspaper to plug its
monthly forums as well as im-
prove the intellectual at-
mosphere on campus, said
Chairman Bill Archer, if the
money can be found.

The E.C. also heard from the
Outing Club, Ariel and Calyx at
the 6:30 meeting.

Focus plans to have the
newspaper ‘‘Excelsior’’

published as is the Ring-tum
Phi, perhaps as a supplement,
and expects the costs to run in
the $600 range.

Archer said he was applying
for ‘‘pilot grants”’ to support the
newspaper. He cited the Morris
foundation and the National En-
dowment for the Humanities as
possible sources.

‘We really want to be a forum
of ideas. That’s why we're try-
ing to do it as non-splashy as
possible and as cheaply as
possible,”’ said Archer.

E.C. president Myers sug-
gested that class papers and
reports be examined for possi-
ble publication.

Jon Pakula, who handles the
group’s publicity, added, ‘‘The
true goal of the Excelsior is not
to restrict it at all, so that every
persons’s class could relate to

Pakula said that the first
issue would deal mainly with
limited nuclear war, which is

crantz and Guildenstern Are Dead” for Washington and Lee

Member Of Class Of °15
Gives $250,000 To W&L |

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has received a gift of
$250,000 from John G. Boat-
wright of Dan’s Hill, Danville,
Va.

Boatwright, a member of
Washington and Lee’s class of
1915, made the gift in memory
of his wife, Mary Archer Glass
Boatwright, and their son, Dr.
Robert McDearmon Boat-
wright, who graduated from

W&L in 1942.

In recognition of the gift, the
rare books reading room in the
University Library will be

named The Boatwright Room.

A plaque recognizing Boat-
wright’s gift will be placed in
that room.

the topic of the first monthly
forum. Later issues would be
less narrow. ‘‘You have to start
somewhere,” said Pakula.

The date of the first Focus
Forum is set at the first Thurs-
day of February, with the Ex-
celsior coming out a week
before that, in January.

Focus reported spending $130
for the stationery it will request
contributions with. Myers said
the work of Focus ‘‘sounds pro-
mising.”’

Tom Stoppard Drops In On Lexington

by John Wells

When British playwright Tom Stoppard arrived
on campus last week, he took in the Southern Vic-
torian spaciousness of Lee House and asked ‘‘Who
else is staying here with me?”’ He was slightly sur-
prised and quite pleased to discover that he alone
would occupy the five-bedroom President’s House
that night.

Anyone apprehensive that Stoppard — probably
as gifted as any current dramatist on either side of
the Atlantic — would be difficult or enigmatic
was pleasantly surprised to discover no trace of
remoteness or eccentricity frequently associated
with one so brilliant. In fact, he was quite charm-
ing and accessible, and his warmth and good
humor shone through frequently in casual conver-
sation. Americans are easily charmed by the
Strains of a British accent, but the depth of Stop-
pard’s personality and intellect is far more im-
pressive than his pleasant speech patterns.

Seated in the small library of Lee House, he
brought to mind earlier physical comparisons by
some to members of the Rolling Stones. In fact, his
face resembles a composite photograph of Jag-
ger/Richards/Wyman, and physically he looks
like Jagger, medium height and lean. He walked
around during the interview, offering opinions and
gesturing with an ever-present filter cigarette.

During the course of the talk it was revealed
that Stoppard, author of more than a dozen plays,
began his career as a newspaper reporter. He pur-
sued this occupation for six years and wrote his
first play in 1960, when, he said, ‘disproportionate
attention’’ was being paid to British theater. He
began reporting without considering any other
future career, and says he misses ‘‘the ambiance,
not the practice’’ of journalism and prefers the
“‘lazier life’ of self-employment. He _ still
subscribes to several different newspapers.

(continued on page 8)

 

It is particularly appropriate
that the rare books reading
room be named The Boatwright
Room. Mrs. Boatwright estab-
lished a special collection in the
library in memory of the Boat-
wright’s son, who died on Nov.
4, 1962. The Boatwright Collec-
tion was established to provide
funds for books of exceptional
beauty which the library would
not otherwise be able to pur-
chase.

The Boatwright Collection
currently numbers more than
275 volumes. The books bear
Dr. Boatwright’s name and rep-
resent a vital portion of the
library’s holdings. Many of the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Exam Week

Throughout ‘the _next week, all students at
Washington and Lee, have a chance to participate in
something that is both a pleasure and a privilege to be
associated with. W&L’s independent examination
syst@tin gives its students the rare opportunity to
determine their own pace of taking final exams.

Unlike many other universities, W&L offers its
students the chance to take their exams whenever
they please (within a one-week period, of course).
This privilege is something that most seasoned
students overlook and most freshmen cannot com-
prehend. Very few universities allow you to take ex-
ams at your own discretion. It is a credit to our honor
system that students need not be doted over by ad-
ministration officials before and during exams.

Also refreshing is the casual attitude that most pro-
fessors take toward the taking of exams. One pro-
fessor, when questioned by a student as to how late he
could change the date of his exam, said that his
department would leave that up to the responsibility
of the student. We view this not as an attitude of
slackness, but one of trust in the system.

Hopefully, most students will adhere to the regula-
tions of our honor system during the next week. By
obeying the honor system, students at this university
are rewarded with the privilege of taking exams at
their own pace. This is a reward that is far to valuable
to lose. Enjoy the next week.

Merry Christmas From The Phi

 

Rock Delta

Dear Sir:

I would like to respond to last
week’s letter by ‘‘Rock Delta
Rock.’’ However, I find it
hardto believe that that’s
someone’s actual name and
since they didn’t have the in-
testinal fortitude to sign their
name to such a highly critical
letter, I cannot address them
directly. Of course, I also think
it is a bad practice for the Phi to
print a letter without a name.

It is far easier for one to
criticize than to participate and
resolve. With regards to the ex-
change program, I think most
will agree how absurd it is to
consider housing ‘‘100-200
females” in the house the
university turned over to Chi
Psi; unless you want a building
like Sweet Briar’s Hostel and
most girls wouldn’t tolerate
that for a semester or year.
Besides, University Services
does provide some housing to
exchange students in Woods
Creek.

Might I ask if you have been
willing to pick up your belong-
ings and move down the road to
encourage the exchange pro-
gram? The program is recipro-
cating. I can assure you that far
more girls come to W&L than
guys go to their schools. Per-
sonally, I have participated in
classes at both Hollins and
Mary Baldwin.

If you have a problem with
“‘Contact,”’ might I suggest you
talk with one of the co-chairmen
and voice your criticism in a
constructive way instead of
complaining in an uneducated
and general manner. Perhaps
you should apply next spring
and assist the committee. (I’m
assuming you’re not a senior,
you don’t sound ready to
graduate. )

not recognize the opportunity at

benefits derived from what Jim

energy into over the last 15
years.

My quote in last week’s Time
was taken out of context by Ms.
Constable but I do not apologize
for it. We have a different situa-
tion here than at most univer-
sities and I still feel it can be en-
joyed and perhaps even bene-
ficial if kept in the proper frame
of mind. I hope W&L will retain
this uniqueness in the years to
come.

While I have a soapbox, on
behalf of the SAB, I’d like to
thank Herring Travel, Le Car-
dinal and Athletic Attic for their
generous support at the Back-

Dear Sir:

Your editorial ‘“‘The Time
Story’’ in the December 3 issue
leaves me even less impressed
with the Phi’s brand of alleged
journalism than I was with the
magazine piece in the first
place.

Not that the Time story was
any paragon of reporting skills;
it was their (Sic.) usual glossed-
over bungling of facts, mixed
with slightly less “human in-
terest’’ pap than _ those
charlatans cram into their
sister publication People. But at
least the writer had a coherent
perspective and didn’t try to
avoid any issues, the main one
here being sexism, specifically
total male domination.

Which is more than I can say
for your editorial. Really, what

 

“Time Story
Labeled As ‘Spineless’

’ Editorial

is a sentence such as ‘This
university's single gender is a
fact of life that is too multi-
faceted to either praise or con-
demn”’ doing in an editorial!?
That isn’t even fluent
bureaucratese, It is a spineless
pontification and an abuse of
your office.

Obviously, W&L has been vic-

Commentary

 

Autumn Athletes

by John M. Cleghorn

The temperature is falling
more and more every day. With
finals upon us in mid-December
we find that another fall has
passed. Rush, fall homecoming,
parents weekend, and Thanks-
giving have all come and gone.
Leaves have covered the hill
and they have sicked them up
with one of those machines that
you always wished you had had
as a kid raking leaves in the
back yard. Even the first snow
has fallen. But the weather is
only one season of the fall the
first snow has fallen. The fall
season is not only marked by
the weather but four seasons as
well. The fall atheleltes have
packed their equipment and
closed their lockers for another
year, their efforts recorded in a

another crack next fall.

The football team started
their fall with late August after-
noons. Their season turned out
to be more of an indian summer
as theu built winning ways. The
seeds that Gary Fallon planted
four years ago finally bloomed
in a conference title. Not all of
the leaves will return to the tree
next fall though a as seniors
such as Mike Pressler, John
Mckee, and Mike Fogarty move
on. It will be a test to see if the
Generals can return reproduce
another title.

The group on campus that
sees the most of Virginia’s fall
foliage is probably the cross
country team. Just as the

soccer standouts Tad Renner,
Kirk Mancer, and _ Roland
Simon received an array of
awards recently from the
Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer
Association (VISA) and from
the National Soccer Coaches’

(NSCAA).

On Tuesday, Dec. 1, Renner
was named to the 11-player
VISA All-State team. A junior
and defensive mainstay from
Raleigh, N.C., Renner becomes
the first W&L All-State player
since Jim Fox received the
honor for the 1974 campaign.

seasons come around every
year, head coach Dick Miller
returned for his twenty ninth
campaign and guided the har-
riers to their twenty first win-
ning season. Several runners
will take their competition in-
side, out of the cold, and run
with the indoor track team. As
for next year, the colors may be
even more brilliant than this
year as the two top runners
return.

It will be a long winter inside
for the soccer team though not
any longer than this fall. The
time inside will be one when in-
juries can heal and morale can
build up again. Rolf Piranian’s
team is a young and skilled one
and with the benéfit of an easier
schedule next fall could be a
much nicer one.

The one group that was
oblivious to the weather was the
polo team. Their 31 wins and
southern league title are the
best mark to date and had it not
been for one Slippery Rock their
pool would have been alot nicer
to swim in. The pool won’t
freeze over this winter though
as many of the polo players
privide the nucles of the swim
team. Page Remillard will see
alot of his players return next
year with the possible addition
of a new recruit or two.

Doremeus Gym is already
filled with the activities of the
winter atheletes but the efforts
of the fall ahtheletes are not to
go unnoticed.

Shenandoah Provides Victory

by G. Bruce Potter

John Lee Graves, George
Spears and Brian Hanson com-
bined for 58 points to lead the
Washington and Lee basketball
team to its first victory of the
season, 94-84 over Shenandoah
College Thursday night at
Warner Center.

The Generals managed to
beat the Hornets’ full-court
pressure early in the game and
jumped out to a 14-6 lead with
16:16 remaining in the first half.
W&L, which upped its record to
1-3, never trailed in the game.

Graves’ jumper gave the
Generals their biggest lead of
the first half at 32-16. The 6-5
sophomore forward led the
team with 22 points to up his
season average to 16.8 points
per game. Junior Frank Eppes
was the leading rebounder with
six rebounds.

Taking a 42-28 lead into the se-
cond half, Washington and
Lee’s defense held Shenandoah
scoreless for the first four
minutes of the final half.
However, in the last 16 minutes,
the Hornets erupted for 56

points to make the final score
respectable.

‘“‘We did not want to get intoa
running game with them,” ex-
plained head coach Verne Can-
field. ‘‘Their 56 second half
points disturbed me a great
deal. We let the tempo get away
from us.”’

With 11:15 left in the game,
Shenandoah, down 57-38, called
a time out to try to get back into
the game. They almost did.

scorers with 31 points, scored
six in less than a minute to cut

day, Dec. 3-4-5.

Bernot, from Hampton, Va.,

The Washington and Lee
wrestling team exploded last
Wednesday night to rout Lynch-
burg College 42-8. ‘‘Things went
our way,” said W&L coach
Gary Franke. ‘‘We got some
breaks and matched up well
against them.’’ The W&L team
as a whole wrestled well, losing
only two bouts the entire night.
150 pound freshman David Har-
rar was named M.V.P. of the
meet.

Following their victory over
Lynchburg, W&L hosted their
eighth annual wrestling invita-

both a school record (breaking
the 46.63 mark he set last year)
and a pool record (breaking a
48.02 standard set in 1972).

“The figures tell the story:
Mike had an_ incredible
weekend,’’ commented _third-
year head coach Page
Remillard, adding that the
lanky competitor also finished
fourth in the 200-yard freestyle
event on Friday and swam on
the 400-yard freestyle relay
team which placed fourth on
Saturday.

colleges were Campbell Univer-
sity, Gettysburg, Georgia Tech,
Hiram College, University of
Richmond, V.M.I., and York

matches, W&L finished seventh

sophomore captain Tim Val-
liere commented that it was a
“definite improvement” over
last year’s performance.

freshman Tom Alleva and 177
pound freshman Jeff Dixon
scored fourth place finishes

rungs and should make him a

pionships in March.”

W&L’s fifth place team finish
left the Generals sandwiched
between several of the state’s
largest Universities. Virginia
claimed the crown by rolling up
548 points to nudge runner-up
Virginia Tech at 536. James
Madison was third at 224,
followed by Old Dominion (175),
W&L (147), Richmond (131),

Up to this point, Coach
Franke has been pleased with

he expresses potential for the
success of this year’s season.
He adds that the team is ‘“‘still

that they have the ability to
learn from them and improve.

As for his objections to Young

UNIVE t PRESS SYNDICATE

RDR, speaking to the ad-
ministration in his letter,
wrote: ‘‘You missed your
chance by giving Chi Psi the old
school house. What a perfect
girls’ dormitory it would have
made. I mean for less than what
it costs to redo the Tucker an-
nex, you could have made a
really nice dorm out of it for say
100-200 girls...and no doubt that
they would have thrown better
parties! Well don’t worry, ‘cuz
you can redeem yourselves
—give Chi Psi SNU’s old house
and you'll have the old school
available for remodeling.”

In the first place Chi Psi was
not ‘‘given’’ their house. Their
national chapter paid the uni-
versity $130,000 to obtain the
structure for them from the city
of Lexington. The local chapter
pays the university a nominal
lease and, in addition, they are
(Sic.) presently repaying a loan
from the school which covered
renovation cost-overruns. To

 

suggest that a girl’s dorm could
throw better parties than a
fraternity house is ludicrous.

As far as giving Chi Psi the
old SNU house that would be out
of the question given the struc-
ture’s present condition.

In conclusion, it was my
understanding that the Phi
didn’t publish anonymous let-
ters. If so, then what is the
reason for making an exception
in Rock Delta Rock’s case?

mark of which to be proud,
because being all-male is a
uniqueness of form rather than
substance.

There is not now and there
never has been a_ valid
academic argument against
coeducation. It is obvious that
reducing the number of male
students admitted in any given

class will allow the University
to accept fewer less-qualified
candidates, and, of course,
totally equal consideration
should be given to female ap-
plicants.

The only valid argument
there has ever been against
coeducation is financial. The

Debaters

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity debaters Lee Feldman, a
sophomore from North Miami
Beach, Fla., and Bill Thomp-
son, a sophomore from Boca
Raton, Fla., compiled a 4-2
record to take third place in the
team competition of the Delta
Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha
Region III Debate Tournament
held at W&L last weekend..

Thompson was named the se-
cond place speaker in the tour-

scenario here is that the Univer-
sity will suffer from decreased
giving because of the perceived
‘selling out’ of going co-ed,
especially from our more con-
servative benefactors. In the
long run, I feel sure that few of
W&L’s friends would abandon
the institution over such a

tangential issue.

How long would W&L suffer
these losses from going co-ed?
‘Until alumni and friends of the
University realize that they can
send their daughters here as
well as their sons.

Does W&L’s Grading System Cheat Hard Work?

by Scott Mason

There is a sad tragedy which
lingers amidst the competitive,
hustle and bustle atmosphere of
W&L academics, a_ tragedy
which is reflected in the futile
toil of the dedicated, hard work-
ing student. How many times
have students labored tirelessly
in preparation for a test only to
have overlooked some slight
detail which encompassed a
major portion of the exam? Or
how many times have two tests
fallen on the same day and the
misfortunate choice to be made
rested upon sacrificing one for
the other or of studying less
than adequately for both?

Some time ago, in an issue of
last year’s Ring-tum Phi, there

appeared an article in the
“Review and Outlook’’ section
urging students not to ‘‘cheat’’
themselves out of a thorough
education by taking relatively
“gut” courses. It appealed to
students to expand their ‘‘intel-
lectual horizons’’ and to
challenge themselves’ with
academically demanding
courses. Herein, perhaps, lies
one of the greatest American
educational myths.

Once having graduated from
W&L, the boundless search for
jobs begins. As an applicant,
one is equipped with a resume
of his college grades and class
standing. More often than not it
is the mere outcome of one’s
G.P.A. which determines his

post college fate. Indeed, the.
circumstances are exact as
when one first applies to
Washington and Lee for a spot
in the subsequent freshman
class. That the representation
of a human being rests upon a

grade, with almost no insight in- -

to the character of that person,
is most certainly a startling, if
not horrifying, truth. The
weight that grade carries with
it is immense as is the destiny of
the individual which it holds in
its grasp.

One of the greatest assets of
Washington and Lee is that it
presents a highly demanding
range of academic courses,
courses which offer the

valuable opportunity to expand
one’s “‘intellectual horizons.”’
Yet the educational system as a
whole, by overemphasizing the
outcome of one’s grade point
average, cheats the diligent,

hardworking student who is .

earnest in his — pursuit of
knowledge. That which lingers
beyond a student’s G.P.A., the
advantages which he has gain-
ed from his college studies and
the extent by which his
“intellectual horizons’? were
broadened, are excluded from
his college record.

The answer, I fear, may,
nevertheless, lie in taking
“gut’’ courses, those which de-
mand least of an individual’s in-

tellectual ability. As Winter

term rapidly approaches, it
may do well, therefore, to

reconsider one’s chosen course
load which lies ahead in the up-
coming semester. Sadly, the
lone appearance of a grade, it
seems, far outweighs the very
purpose of the American educa-
tional institution. It is a high
price to pay for a student to pur-
sue the expansion of his intellec-
tuality amidst a Sorely misguid-
ed educational system. The
broadening of one’s “‘intellec-
tual horizons” has no place in
the destiny of the college stu-
dent. Rather, it remains an
academic non-essential, an

American educational myth.

In the 30th anniversary year
of its composition, The Cincin-
nati Opera will perform Gian-
carlo Menotti’s Christmas
opera ‘“‘Amahl and the Night

Visitors’ on Sun., Dec. 13, at
2:30 p.m. in the Virginia
Military Institute’s new

Cameron Hall in Lexington.
‘Amahl and the Night

Visitors” is the second of four _

the Rockbridge
37th

events in
Concert-Theatre Series’

The opera was commissioned
by the National Broadcasting
Corporation for a_ television
premiere on Dec. 24, 1951.

After the opera performance,
there will be a reception in

Cameron Hall by the Cincinnati
Opera for the public.

In the first half of the pro-
gram, members of the
‘“‘Amahl”’ cast will sing arias
from the opera repertory. The

for adults and $5 for children.

School Offers Reading Skills Course

As a service to Washington
and Lee students, the Universi-
ty has once again this year
engaged Baldridge Reading
and Study Skills, Inc. to offer on
campus a_ special program
designed to improve reading
and learning skills in academic
subjects.

The program is not merely a
speed-reading course. Its
techniques are designed to in-
crease reading speed, to
strengthen comprehension, to
improve recall, to sustain con-

centration and to deepen

analysis. A student uses his own
classroom reading materials
rather than mass-prepared in-
structional literature and
mechanical training aids.

This program will be con-
ducted on the Washington and
Lee campus by an instructor
from Baldridge Reading from
January 11 through February 5.
Scheduling will be flexible to ac-
commodate individual student
schedules, and classes will be
small to permit necessary in-

dividual attention. Each stu-
dent will attend a total of twenty
sessions, five per week. Tuition
for the program will be $80,
payable by the start of the pro-
gram upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and
registration cards may be ob-
tained from the Office of the
Dean of Students, Payne Hall 6.
Interested students should
register for the course as soon
as possible.

(continued from page 1)
Gregory reported that
newsletters had been posted
around campus to advertise the
Outing Club. So far, the club has
sponsored two canoe trips, two
caving trips and a hiking trip.

Weekly ski trips are planned
for Winter term.

Ariel editor Andrew Trotter
reported that the new issue of
the literary magazine was out
at a cost of about $1000 for 900
copies.

‘“T feel pretty good, I mean,
best yet, about the quality,”
said Trotter.

Trotter said that there were
fewer photography submissions
this year, but that the exclusion
of photography had provided
room for more prose in the

same amount of space used last
year.

The yearbook’s business
manager told the Comnaittee
that contributions from parents
would probably double last
year’s amount. He had received
$5040 from parents, plus $250 for
Monday alone.

Last year’s amount was $2700
in contributions.

Business Manager Scott Fitz-
gerald credited the increase to
getting out letters earlier than
other groups on campus.

In new business, President
Myers mentioned that transfer
and exchange students were ex- -
pected to attend his lecture
tonight at 7 on the Honor
System and independent ex-
aminations.

Applications Available
For Year In Hong Kong

Applications are now being
accepted for Washington and
Lee students interested in spen-
ding a year at Hong Kong’s
Chung Chi College as part of the
exchange program between the
two schools.

Chung Chi, which is part of
the Chinese University of Hong
Kong, is a _ coeducational,
liberal arts college academical-
ly comparable to Washington
and Lee.

But Hong Kong and Lexington
are anything but comparable.
While Hong Kong continues to
observe Chinese traditions, it is
busily involved in the Western
world as a British crown colony.
That double nature affords
American students a unique op-
portunity to become involved in
a rich and varied Chinese
culture with the assurance that
language will not be a major
barrier.

All of the students and faculty
at Chung Chi speak English.

Many courses are offered in
English. The adviser for foreign
students at Chung Chi helps ar-
range a schedule that would be
suitable for most major pro-
grams at Washington and Lee.

Although exchange students
can rely on English while at
Chung Chi, any student in-
terested in the program is
strongly urged to take Chinese
111-112 or Chinese 173 (in
Taiwan) and also to take East
Asian Civilization, History
103-104.

Exchange arrangements are
simple: W&L students pay the
fees for the academic year at
W&L, then exchange places
with a student from Chung Chi
who will spend the academic
year studying here.

For information on the ex-
change program, interested
Students. should contact Pro-
fessor H.J. Pemberton of the
philosophy department.

‘Breaker Morant’ Lauded

by Todd Jones

Coming to the State Theater
is the movie Breaker Morant.
Breaker Morant is a movie
which captured all the top
awards at the 1980 Cannes Film
Festival. The movie was also
nominated for the Oscar for
Best Foreign Film. After seeing
the film, it is obvious why it
received so many accolades.
Breaker Morant is one of the
finest films made in a good
while.

The movie takes place during
the Boer War at the turn of the
century. The English have
developed a special task force
of its armed forces to deal with
Boer terrorist tactics. Put in
charge of this group was a man
named Morant who got the
nickname ‘“‘Breaker’’ because
of his ability to steal horses. The
group developed some different
tactics which became very suc-
cessful. However, for some
reason, Morant is sent up for a
court martial. His charge is kill-
ing the enemy.

Because the courtmartial in-
volves murder, the penalty is

Christmas Gifts and Decorations

death. Two of Morant’s friends
are also in the charge. From the
beginning of the trial, it is ob-
vious that Morant is involved in
a kangaroo court. Each point
brought up by the defense is
knocked down by the tribunal
running the court martial.

The emotions that run
through this film are strong.
Morant must literally fight for
his life, and try to defend his ac-
tions for what he thought was
normal practice. Somehow, he
manages to keep his sense of
humor, and adds some funny

lines throughout the story.

When the film reaches its con-

clusion, it is climaxed by one of .

the best photographed scenes in

a movie this year. The
photography throughout the
film is excellent.

Breaker Morant is a tremen-
dously moving story. One
leaves the theater not only car-
rying the mood of the film, but
also realizing that he has just
seen an excellent movie. In
short, Breaker Morant is the
best movie I’ve seen in the past
few years.

dramatically contrasting pro-
“Il Tabarro,” a pas-
sionate love triangle that ends

W&L’s lead to 13. However,
Canfield said he “was not too
concerned.”

He didn’t need to be as a pair
of free throws by Graves and a
Hanson three-point play erased
any doubt as to the victor of this

game. The last seven minutes
took about half an hour to com-
plete as there were numerous
fouls at both ends of the floor.

The win was slightly sobering
to the Generals as they lost star-
ting guard Billy Yates, a soph-

omore, early in the game due to ©

a back problem. Classmate,
Henry Bond filled in for him and
scored 14 points, however.

W&L shot 65 percent from the
floor, which pleased. Canfield.
“Our high shooting percentage
indicates that; we’re not
shooting from downtown,” he
said.

“We still need to work on our
offensive timing in general. We
need to coordinate the move-
ments of our guards with our
big men,’’ said Canfield.

Another problem that has
plagued the team so far this
year is that of turnovers, but the

eighteenth year coach has
merely chalked that up to a lack
of experience. ‘‘I was more or
less satisfied (with the Shenan-

doah game),’’ Canfield said. ‘‘I
am hard to please, but I was fif-
ty percent pleased.”

The Generals closed out the
1981 portion of their schedule
against Allegheny College last
night at the Warner Center.

W&L will host Swarthmore Col-
lege on Tues., Jan. 5 at 8 p.m. in

Alex N. Dragnich, professor
emeritus of political science at
Vanderbilt University, will be
visiting distinguished lecturer
in politics at Washington and
Lee for the winter term. He will

government and international
relations.

wrights.

‘We are indeed appreciative
of Mr. Boatwright’s gift and are
honored to name The Boat-
wright Room in memory of
Mrs. Boatwright and their son,
Dr. Robert McDearmon Boat-
wright,’’ said Washington and
Lee president Robert E.R.
Huntley. ‘‘The Boatwright
Room will be, for many years to
come, a place that students,
faculty, alumni, and friends will
use, just as The Boatwright Col-
lection has become an_ in-
valuable and beautiful addition
to the library.”

John G. Boatwright is a
former president of Dibrell
Brothers Inc. in Danville and
was for many years associated
with the leaf tobacco industry.
Dan's Hill, the Boatwright’s
home near Danville, is well
known both for the beauty of its

gardens and_its_ historic
significance.
Mrs. Boatwright was the

ington and both the master’s
and Ph.D. degrees from the
University of California at
Berkeley.

Prior to joining the faculty at
Vanderbilt in 1950, Dragnich
served as cultural attache and
public affairs officer for the
American Embassy in Bel-
grade, Yugoslavia.

Dragnich held the Chester W.

Woodberry Forest School. He
studied medicine at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania School of
Medicine, earning his M.D.
degree in 1945. After serving an
internship at Delaware Hospital
in Wilmington, Del., he entered
the medical corps of the US.
Army and served until 1948
when he returned to Philadel-
phia to pursue further graduate
studies. He became a diplomate
in otolaryngology and further
specialized in bronchology. He
had a private practice in
Philadelphia and was on the
staff of four of that city’s
hospitals.

In 1967 came the premiere of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead, which the London
Observer hailed as ‘‘the most brilliant debut of the
sixties.’’ Stoppard went on to write Jumpers
(1972), Travesties (1975) and Night and Day
(1978). His latest work is On the Razzle, an adap-
tion of a 19th century farce written by an Austrian
monk named Johan Nestroy. It is the original
source of Thornton Wilder’s The Matchmaker.

Stoppard’s work, placed in the modern absur-
dist tradition, has drawn comparisons to that of
Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter and
Edward Albee, but it remains unique.

As he would explain in his Glasgow Committee-

_ sponsored lecture (The Text and the Event) that

night, Stoppard is far more interested in the actual
performance of a play than in the ‘‘academic
aspect”’ of writing it.

“Plays aren’t written for study,” he explained.
“It’s an event rather than a script. Plays are writ-
ten to be seen, not read.”’

The playwright becomes actively involved with
the staging of his works, although he professes no
desire to direct ‘‘as such. It’s too time consuming.
My writing time is quite precious as it is.”

Stoppard was asked if it is possible for an actor
to be too smart (recalling a quote in an earlier in-
terview). “It doesn’t hurt to be too smart in any
occupation,”’ he said. “I suppose an actor can
over-intellectualize from the inside — which holds
good for writers like (Neil) Simon and (Thornton)
Wilder. I have a sense of the surface of a produc-
tion. A play makes a certain kind of noise.”’

He attends other plays occasionally, but said ‘‘I
go as a playgoer, not a playwright.” Which of his
own plays does he like best? ‘There isn’t one, real-
ly. [can’t say one’s a favorite particularly.”

He finds immediate criticism ‘‘interesting”’ as
the first real comment on his work, but it fades
with time, and ‘when I find an old cutting in a
drawer, it’s of no interest.”

His views on U.S. culture are interesting and
rarely negative. On aspects of his first chosen pro-
fession, comparing tube to type:

“Television journalism is more efficient — it’s
shocking, has more impact,” he said. But print “‘is
much more important in the long-run. It’s not as
discardable as pictures” briefly flashed on the
screen.

He finds obvious differences in the press of this
country and his own. British newspapers aren ‘tas

‘‘naked about their dependence on advertising,’’
he said. ‘‘It doesn’t hit you every time you open the
paper. The New York Times — there’s an eight
column ad for Bergdorf Goodman and one column
of news. Then Macy’s, Brooks Brothers, Lord &
Taylor...”

‘American T.V. journalism is famous for its
crassness all over the world. I don’t object to it at
all,” he said, blaming the ratings rat race. ‘‘A free
press is the last bastion — when you lose a free
press, you lose a free society. That’s it.” ‘

Stoppard talked about the Committee for a Free
World, with which he says he has a “‘loose connec-
tion.”’ A description of what the organization is
about highlighted his own beliefs.

The committee, he said, ‘thas no right/left,
East/West ax to grind as such. The issues are
moral, not political — there is a certain way
governments should behave toward each other.
People are in jail for expression of views — ab-
solute commonplace activities we take for
granted.”

On American television he’s seen in England:
‘“‘They make things very well.’’ He thinks that
Johnny Carson’s recent entry into British T.V.
was oversold, resulting in a critical backlash.

‘(Carson’s) popularity in the states is amazing
and it must be deserved. I admire him a lot — I ad-
mire anyone who can think on his feet like that.”

On American theater: How does he, a
playwright of high calibre, regard Broadway’s
glaring stretch of flashy, expensive and otherwise
unimportant musicals and revivals? ‘‘While that
description is frequently made,” he said, ‘I’m

sure there are some fine plays written over here
that I’d never see.”’

What’s he working on now?

‘““A contemporary play — realistic, quiet conver-
sation with no show business pizazz.’’ Was he
referring to a play called A Quiet Room he’d men-
tioned in an earlier interview?

“Well, actually it’d be ten different rooms.”’

Stoppard was reportedly pleasant company in
the bookstore that afternoon, at a private dinner
later at the Palms, and in his speech. Considering
that he has had scant experience on the campus
lecture circuit, his talk, delivered without notes,
was a definite crowd pleaser. The crowd in Lee
Chapel included people from as far away as Rich-
mond, but was conspicuously absent of many
students.
