E.C. Makes Progress On

Intellectual Symposium 4

by Todd Smith

The’’Intellectual Sym-

posium”’ moved one step closer
to fulfillment on Monday night,

with the Executive Committee
laying the groundwork of a sub-
committee, to be headed by
Sophomore Representative Ben
Hale.

Professor Thomas Williams
addressed the E.C. on the edu-
cational benefits, the publicity
value, and the positive effects
on Spring Term, entailed in the
Symposium. Williams and
Senior Representative Tripp
Brower worked together in the
brainstorming of the event.

The Symposium is modeled
on Mock Convention. Every
four years the campus would
gather for lectures, seminars,
competitions; and festivities,
all planned around a central
theme. The product would be a

white paper.

freshmen.

Williams warned that the
topic chosen for the first sym-
posium would make or break
the project. He suggested sev-
eral topics, all non-political:
Crime, World Hunger, Athle-
tics, Extraterrestrial life, etc.

Wary that discussion would
drag on past 11 p.m., Hale put
the Symposium to a vote. The
passed motion makes no provi-
sion for funding, nor does it pro-
vide any framework for the sub-
committee.

Sophomore Ted McQuiston
questioned the Symposium’s
appeal to students and cast the
only vote against the measure.

Most of the evening was spent
interviewing student applicants
for positions on faculty commit-
tees. Former president Steve
Abraham applied for the Facul-
ty Executive Committee. Abra-

Book Prices Rise

by Kenneth S. Nankin

Nearly every W&L student
was confronted with the neces-
sity of buying assigned text-
books last week and many ques-
tioned the cause behind the
seemingly overinflated prices.
According to bookstore man-
ager Betty Munger, the average
expenditure ranged from ‘‘80 to
100 dollars.”

While various theories have
been advanced as to the reasons
behind the high costs, Ms.
Munger defended the book-
store’s prices.

“We do not arbitrarily make
up a number,”’ she said. Rather,
she indicated the publishers,

‘for they ‘‘know they have a
captive market. The publisher
determines the base price.”’

Regarding the question of
faculty influence on textbook
prices, Ms. Munger replied that
“the faculty are extremely con-
scious of the costs.’’ She ruled
out accusations of faculty insen-
sivity to the average student’s
financial situation.

Still, there is some hope for
the student who wishes to
economize on textbook costs.
One way is to sell used tex-
tbooks back to the bookstore.
‘‘We buy back books at half the
price in May,” commented Ms.

contested seat.

Of the five applying for this
position, George Carey ’82 was
selected. President Eric Myers
happily noted that the turn-out
for the student positions was
much better than last year.

After the interviews, Tripp

Brower suggested that the E.C.
table, “‘marred beyond belief,’’
be spruced up.

John Viahoplus moved to run
an ad in the VMI newspaper
lauding their football defeat of
Army, aS was suggested by
Abraham.

A party with band for under-
graduates and law students will
kick off homecoming weekend,
noted .Vice President Jim
Averett. He sees this Pavillion
Party as a small way to bind the
two campuses. Several dollars
will be charged by the Student
Bar Association for the Thurs-
day, Oct. 7, event.

Freshmen ‘Adjusting Well’
to Crowded Dorm Conditions

by Bob Schlegel

Living in a freshman dor-
mitory is a difficult situation for
many first-year college stu-
dents throughout the country.
But at Washington & Lee, where
many single rooms have been
turned into double rooms this
year, dormitory life has become
even more of a problem.

Due to the renovation of
Graham-Lees Dormitory this
year, Washington & Lee’s
largest freshman dorm, all ex-
isting rooms on campus now ac-
commodate two. students, with
the exception of the counselors’
rooms, which are all singles. In
addition, three and one half
floors of the Robert E. Lee
Hotel serve as dorm rooms for
W&L freshmen.

Despite these tight living
quarters, which are most
noticeable in Gilliam. Dor-
mitory, the Class of ’85 seems to
be getting along well.

Dean of Freshmen H. Robert
Huntley stated, ‘“‘By and large,
the freshman class is adjusting
well.’’ Dean Huntley admits
that the rooms are tight, but he
also knows there is no way you
can get around the problem.
There are 370 freshmen in the
Class of ’85, and the university
is supplying 370 beds.

Dean Huntley also pointed out
that the university had the
choice of a two-year period of
renovation or a fifteen month
period. Fortunately, the shorter
period was chosen, which
means that Graham-Lees
should be completely renovated
by the end of August, 1982. ‘‘If it
(Graham-Lees) is not ready,’’
said the Dean, ‘‘there will be
heads rolling all over the
place.”’ Luckily for the owners
of those heads, the renovation
has proceeded on schedule so
far.

Dean Huntley realizes the
problems that can arise from
two people living in such close
quarters. In choosing room-
mates this year, the university
used the trusty computer,
which matched up students on
the basis of their likes and
dislikes, study habits, etc.

One of the results of the
crowded conditions in the
dorms will be a greater number
of students utilizing the library.
Dean Huntley commented, ‘I
think you'll see greater pres-
sure on the library as a study
facility than in the past.’ He is
pleased with this possibility.

He also emphasized the fact
that the Cockpit is open for
longer hours this year, to give

freshmen a place to go. Addi-
tionally, a student lounge is be-
ing organized in the basement
of the student center, and it will
be ready for use as soon as
possible.

Residents of Gilliam Dor-
mitory do, in fact, seem to be
adjusting well, as Dean Huntley
stated. The smallest rooms are
located toward the middle of the
building. These rooms are filled
with bunk beds, two dressers,
two desks, and two students. In

Mrs. Lewis Makes Donation

Washington & Lee University
has received a $250,000 gift from
Mrs. Dora L. Lewis of Rich-
mond, Va., to establish an en-
dowed honor scholarship pro-
gram at the university.

To be named the Dora L.
Lewis Scholarships, the pro-
gram will fund several scholar-
ships equal to the amount of
W&L’s tuition ($4800 in 1981-82)
each year.

The Lewis Scholarships will
be awarded to students who not
only possess outstanding re-
cords of academic achieve-
ment, but who also demonstrate
unusual promise for future ser-
vice and leadership.

The first four Lewis Scholars
were announced this month.
They are Jeffrey David Dixon
of Duncan, Ok., Scott Joseph
Henderson of Marysville, Ohio;
John Harold Moore of Colum-
bia, $.C.; and Peter Thornton
Wilbanks of Seaford, Del. All
are entering freshmen at W&L.
All will have their Lewis
Scholarships. renewed each
year they attend W&L, provided
they maintain satisfactory
records.

Mrs. Lewis, one of the univer-
sity’s staunchest supporters, is
president of New Standard Pub-
lishing Company, Inc., of Rich-
mond. She was for many years
secretary and treasurer of Best
Products Company, Inc., and
remains active in the manage-
ment of the company.

A native of Richmond, Mrs.
Lewis has been active in
numerous civic clubs in that ci-
ty. She is a member of the
Jewish Center of Richmond, the
Richmond Historical Society,
and the Virginia Society for the
Performing Arts. She is active
in the Temple Beth-E] Syn-
agogue. She has long been a
generous supporter of the Crip-
pled Children’s Hospital in
Richmond.

‘‘] thought I would like to help
any student who wanted an ed-
ucation' at Washington & Lee,
and this ‘seemed the most ap-
propriate way,’ Mrs. Lewis

 

said of her gift to the university.

Mrs. Lewis is the mother of
Sydney Lewis, a Washington &
Lee graduate and a member of
the’ university’s Buatd of
Trustees.

DOWN

THE ROAD:

You Owe
A Trip to

First in a series
Sweet Briar College
Amherst, Va

In starting off this year’s
series of local girls’ schools’
reviews, we figured that Sweet
Briar College would be the
logical place to start, since
Sweet Briar reviews generally
stir up the greatesi fuss.

A quick warning, freshmen.
Sweet Briar women hate to be
kidded about their school. You
can make jokes about pink-and-
green clothes or horseback
riding, but you’re digging your
own grave.

Witness last year’s letters to
the editor following the Phi’s
review of Sweet Briar. The
authors, who to this date re-
main anonymous, were called
everything from ‘‘a coward” to
‘“‘hegrudging’’ to ‘‘foot-in-
mouth.”’ Apparently, Hell hath
no fury like a Sweet Briar girl
scorned.

Anyway, here are a few
observations of Sweet Briar,
also known as ‘‘Sweetbush”’ or
“the Bush’’, which is located in
Amherst, a slightly-longer-than
an hour’s drive up, down and
around Rte. 60.

Sweet Briar has the prettiest
campus of all the surrounding
girl schools. Mountains arise
near the school, giving it a
scenario last seen in : ‘The
Sound of Music.’ The moun-
tains provide a natural escape
for all would-be hikers, climb-
ers, etc. It also gives
freshminks good cases of tossed
cookies their first few times
over.

Blown beets or not, all
freshminks owe it to themselves
to enjoy the Sweet Briar ex-
perience. What they will find is

Yourself
The Bush

a school that is (a) as closely
guarded as the king’s jewels
and (b) worried of fading into
obscurity.

Upon entering the college
grounds, your car will be stop:
ped by a guard standing in a
shack which, according to last

year’s Phi ‘‘looks like 2
photomat.”’ Security at the
Bush is rivaled only by

Randolph-Macon’s — and the
guards will indeed come a-
runnin’ at the appointed hour
Sweet Briar takes its securit:
seriously.

We'll refrain from makin;
references of Sweet Briar’s sex
uality. Every freshmamhears of
cold Sweet Briar beds at orien-
tation. Such judgment should be
left to the individual.

For entertainment, you can
choose from the Boathouse.
home of the annual ‘Bums’
dance, the Boxwood house, or
the various dorms. Be carefu
which group you come ir
though, for some fraternities
have run-ins with the Amherst
police over various _bottle-
throwing experiences.

The only problems you'll find
at Sweet Briar are the ones akin
to all the girls schools — smoke
filled rooms, warm brews and
some fashions that should be
taken with a grain of salt — o:
just plain grain.

For an overall rating, Sweet
Briar remains quite an enigma.
Times spent there range from
excellent to rotten. But con-
sidering the proximity of the
campus and the variety of fe-
males, you owe yourself a trip
to the Bush.

McThenia Drafts
Property Changes

Andrew W. McThenia Jr.,
professor of law at Washington
& Lee University, is one of the
principal architects of a new
proposal on unclaimed property
that the Uniform Law Commis-
sion will urge state legislatures
to adopt.

McThenia, a Virginia com-
missioner on uniform laws, was
one of the reporter-draftsmen of
the proposal adopted earlier
this month at the annual meet-
ing of the Uniform Law Com-
mission (ULC).

The ULC is a confederation of
state commissions on uniform
laws. The 250 practicing law-
yers, judges and law professors
who are ULC members are
selected by each of the 50 states,
the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico. They draft and
urge adoption of legislative pro-
posals designed to solve pro-
blems common to all states.

The proposed Uniform Un-
claimed Property Act of 1981
which McThenia was instru-
mental in drafting deals with
property that has been lost or
abandoned by its rightful
owner. The property ranges
from stocks and bonds to utility
deposits to paramutuel tickets.

According to the UL, an
astonishing number of Amer-
icans deposit money in banks
and simply forget about it. Or
they buy stock and move
without bothering to leave the
company a forwarding address
for their dividend checks.

As a consequence, billions of
dollars lie abandoned in such
financial pockets. Often, the
rightful owner has died and the
heirs are unaware that a wind-
fall could be theirs.

The ULC committee of whioh
McThenia was a member draft-
ed a proposal designed to re-
unite owners with their proper-
ty and to streamline its transfer
to state custody.

In addition to McThenia, the
other reporter-draftsman of the
ULC proposal is David J. Eps-
tein, a practicing lawyer in Los

_Angeles.

McThenia, who received both
his undergraduate and law
degrees from Washington’ &
Lee, joined the law school facul-
ty in 1967.

dents do see something
suspicious happening on
campus, they should notify
campus security. Students
should call 463-9111 and ask for
ext. 198, or dial 463-9118 after

midnight.

The Lexington Police force
will also be patrolling the
streets. Police Chief James Kir-
by was unable to hire any addi-

cutbacks. He did stress that
students can reduce the number
of crimes themselves, especial-

‘Two men should be assigned to
scrutinize the party, and stay
sober in case a problem should
arise.” “This way,” Kirby add-
ed, “‘if a problem should occur,
we have at least one man who
has a clear head that we can

been sold back for much less. If
a student does intend to sell
books back, warned Ms. Mun-
ger, he should avoid high-
lighting in them ‘‘otherwise you
might not be able to sell them

A final tip is to purchase a
used textbook as opposed to a
new one, for there is a signifi-

cant price difference between
the two. While new textbooks

. are generally in better condi-

tion, ‘‘used books will save you
money,’’ Ms. Munger said.

Although the actual cause of
high prices is of relatively little
comfort to the student who has
just completed his textbook pur-
chases, there exist ways that
can be utilized to save him
money when a new term begins.

Review:

Arthur! Arthur!

by Todd Jones
Arthur Bach is rich. Very
rich. Arthur is worth about $750
million. When asked how it feels
to have all that money, he re-
plies: ‘‘It feels great!”
“Great!” is an excellent ad-
jective for Arthur, surely one of
the best films released this
summer. Dudley Moore stars as
Arthur Bach, a rich playboy
who spends most of his time en-
joying life to its fullest, which
usually means getting drunk.
Arthur’s father, however, is
dissatisfied with the way his son
has turned out, and decides it is
time for him to settle down. He
arranges a marriage between
Arthur and the daughter of a
business partner of his. Arthur
does not want to marry the girl,
but changes his mind when his
father explains that, if he re-
fuses, he will be cut off from the
ihree-quarters of -a_ billion
dollars. While shopping for a
new wardrobe, Moore observes
a girl shoplifting. He chases her
into the street, and almost im-
mediately falls in love with her.
The woman is Liza Minnelli,
who portrays, as usual, an out-
of-work actress. Falling in love
with this girl creates a dilemma
for Arthur, who must now

choose between a life of wealth
with a woman he despises or a
life of poverty with the woman
he loves.

Arthur is billed as a com-
edy/love story. I would concur
with this idea, but I would argue
that the love story is not that
between Minelli and Moore, but
rather that between Moore and
his butler, played by Sir John
Gielgud. Throughout the film;
one feels the father-son rela-
tionship between Arthur and his
butler, Mr Hobson. It is less a
usual master-servant relation-
ship than a paternal one. In my
opinion, Gielgud is the best ac-
tor in the film. His portrayal of
Mr Hobson allows him to de-
liver the best lines in the movie.
His characterization was so fun-
ny, yet so real, that I think he
has put in the best performance
as a supporting actor in any
movie so far this season. His
scenes with Moore are without
doubt the best in the movie, and
among the best this year.

Dudley: Moore is onscreen
almost constantly. As Arthur
Bach, he is quite funny, al-
though some of his drunken
scenes are a little ove::done and
border on_ slapstick. Since

Richmond Sinfonia
in Lee Chapel

The Richmond: Sinfonia,
under the musical direction of
French conductor Jacques
Houtmann, will present the first
concert of the Washington &
Lee University Concert Guild
season on Monday, Sept. 28, at 8
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Tickets for the concert are $3.
Members of the Washington &
Lee University community are
admitted free of charge.

Comprised of outstanding
musicians from conservatories
and orchestras across the coun-
try, the Sinfonia has been called
‘a tightly knit, well-disciplined
ensemble, flexible in technique
and musicianship, and respon-
sive to the interpretive aims of
its conductor’ according to the
Richmond News Leader.

The Sinfonia’s program will
consist of Handel’s ‘‘Concerto
Grosso in A-Minor, opus 6, no.
4’’: Mozart’s ‘‘Concerto No. 4 in
D-Major for Violin and Or-
chestra,”’ featuring violinist Ida
Kavafian; and, Beethoven’s
‘Symphony No. 2in D-Major.”’

Performing as an ensemble
since 1973, the Sinfonia is one of
less than 10 such groups in the
United States and has been hail-

ed as a bold new development in
the music world. This ensemble
forms the nucleus of the Rich-
mond Symphony, one of the
country’s leading regional or-
chestrasry 9 f;y

The Sinfonia. has presented
concerts in all geographical
areas of ¥ifZihia and performs
annually ‘for‘over 50,000 school
childrenjand thousands of addi-
tional Virginians at concerts
sponsored by colleges, music
clubs and other organizations
throughout the state. The Sin-
fonia’s repertoire encompasses
music from the 17th through the
20th centuries.

Houtmann, director and con-
ductor of both the Richmond
Symphony and the Sinfonia,
was born in Mirecourt, France,
and began his musical educa-
tion at the Nancy Consevatory
where he studied violin, horn
and harmony. He received his
concert license at the Ecole de
Musique in Paris as a pupil of
Jean Fournet and Henri Dutil-
leux and subsequently studied
symphonic’ and operatic con-
ducting under Franco Ferrara
at the Consevatory of Santa
Cecilia in Rome.

continued on p. 8

Moore plays the title role, the
success of the entire film is
dependent on his performance.
And the film is very enjoyable.

Filling out the cast is Ted
Ross as Arthur’s chauffeur, and
Geraldine Fitzgerald as Ar-
thur’s dirty-minded, — strong-
willed grandmother.

Much of the film, I think, is
based on the premise that the
audience would like to be in Ar-
thur’s shoes. At one point in the
film, Moore comments, “Don’t
you wish you were me? I know I
do.”’ This is an important idea.
The chance for the filmgoer to
fantasize about living, Arthur-
style, is one of the reasons the
movie gives the viewer such a

itive feeling. I know if I had
$750 million dollars, three Rolls-
Royces, and John Gielgud-as a
father-figure, and be able to en-
joy; life the way Mooredoes in
thig film, I would be Arthur...
without a moment’s hesitation.

Generals Show Their
Stuff In 24-17 Win

by Dale Park

A goal-line stand with six
minutes left to play allowed the
Washington & Lee varsity foot-
ball team to hold on to a 24-17
win over ODAC rival Emory &
Henry College last Saturday in
Emory, Virginia.

The victory evened the
Generals’ overall record at 1-1
and gave them a 1-0 ODAC
mark.

W&L’s junior tailback Chris
Cavalline got things rolling late
in the first period with a one-
yard touchdown run that gave
the Generals a 7-0 lead.

Only seventeen seconds later
E&H knotted the game at 7-7
with an 81-yard scoring pass
and then took the lead momen-
tarily in the second period on a
30-yard field goal conversion.

Al Paradise, playing almost the
entire game, quickly put the
Generals back on top. Paradise
scrambled in from five yards
for a score late in the second
quarter, later leading his team
in an early third quarter drive
capped off by a_ two-yard
Cavalline touchdown run.
Several minutes later junior
kicker Bill Devine added a 38-
yard field goal to his three suc-
cessful point-after conversions

‘and the Generals’ lead stretch-

ed to 24-10.

The Wasps drew within a
touchdown early in the fourth
period on a 25-yard scoring pass
and had a chance to tie and
possibly win the game late in
the period as a pass _ inter-
ference call gave E&H the ball
on the W&L one-foot line.

one dive play and one incom-
plete pass later E&H was still
not in the end zone. The
Generals took over deep in their
own territory and ran out the
clock with a drive which includ-
ed several crucial first downs.

On the afternoon, Paradise
completed eight of thirteen
passes for 109 yards while
Cavalline carried the ball 38
times for 156 yards and two
touchdowns.

“Al (Paradise) really came
through for us,” said Head
Coach Gary Fallon, “yet he still
needs time to gain a full grasp
of the offense.” Fallon admitted
that the quarterback situation
is still “up in the air’ as the
coach searches for a consistent
team leader.

Commenting on Cavalline’s

“work horse” role, Fallon of-
fered, “we don’t want,, to
overuse him (Cavalline). He’ sa

punishing type runner. ,j@nd
sometimes that can take its toll.

Commentary:

 

 

 

 

 

Junior Tailback Chris Cavalline carried the ball 38 times for 156
yards and two touchdowns.

He does so much punting and
pass receiving for us that we’ve
got to figure out a way to spell
him once in a while.”’

The Generals’ next big test
will come against Centre Col-

lege of Danville, Kentucky.
Last year W&L defeated the
Colonels, 16-9, in Danville.

Game time is 1:30 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Violent Sunday Morning

by John Cleghorn

Sunday morning, while most
of the university community
was sleeping off Saturday
night’s party or looking over the
morning paper there were some
very strange goings on in
Turner gym. Down the hall one
could hear threatening yells
and screams that echoed in the
humid indoor pool. If curiosity
drove you into this | noisy
enclosure the scene there would
have appeared even more
strange. Twelve bodies in a pool
with colored shower caps, and
eye black were flailing their
arms in the air and thrashing
their legs in the water. Finally
they split up into groups. with
blue caps on one side of the pool
and white on the other. Both
ends had a big net and a man in

it who ‘would occasionally shoot

up, grab the top bar and hang
for a while. But this fascinating
behavior was quickly stopped
when two men in white walked
out on the sides of the pool.
These characters carried sticks
that had a white flag on one end
and a blue flag on the other. One
carried a bright yellow ball and
as he gave a shrill blast on his
whistle the guys in the water
grew silent and aimed them-
selves at each other across the

pool. One of the characters on
the side knelt down at about the
middle of the pool and blasted
his whistle. With this the
players shot off from the edge of
the pool swimming furiously
directly at each other. Just
about the time the two on the
edge of the pool hit head on, the
fellow in white dropped the ball
between them. Now it all
started to make a little sense.
This minor war was in fact

31 S. Main St.,

 

CRAFTS PLUS, INC,

GAMES, HOBBIES, & CRAFT SUPPLIES

the final game of the Water Polo
Review Fall Classic which pit-
ted W&L against, appropriately
enough, Slippery Rock. The
Generals fell 13-5 but for this
my first polo game it was a dan-
dy. I think it would be safe to
say that the majority of W&L
students have never seen water
polo, which is a real shame be-
cause this game offers it all. If
you're into violence it is certain-
ly satisfying. The one on one
defense, somewhat similar to
basketball or lacrosse, features
a constant battle for position
between two players whether
the ball is nearby or not. The of-
fensive strategy also resembles
lacrosse and in some ways
hockey as teams form a peri-
meter around the goal to set up
a shot.

By drawing similarities be-
tween polo and other sports I
certainly do not intend to say it
is the same. The aspect of con-
stantly being in and having to
do all this in the water sets this
game apart from any other. If
you’ve never seen water polo, I
recommend it highly as a com-
petitive and vigorous game, and
W&L, who competes with the
best teams in the nation, cer-
tainly offers high skill and
quality play.

  

  
Booters

by John Harrison

The Washington & Lee soccer
team recorded its second
shutout of the season when it
defeated an inexperienced
Maryville (Tenn.) team last
Saturday, 4-0. The victory gave
the Generals a 1-0 record in the
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference and an overall record of
2-0.

Sophomore forward Roland
Simon led the attack with two
goals and an assist. Simon and
Gary Clements, who contribut-
ed a goal and two assists,
shared  player-of-the-game
honors. Senior tri-captain Tad
Renner added the fourth goal.

The Generals are planning to
meet a much tougher opponent
when they take on Haverford
(Pa.) Saturday morning at 9:30.
Head coach Rolf Piranian com-
mented on the strength of the
Fords: ‘“They’re known for hav-
ing a superb soccer program.
We were fortunate to get them
on our schedule; however, we
will definitely go into the con-
test as underdogs.”

Get Hot

Haverford will bring a
somewhat misleading 0-2
record into Lexington. The

losses have been to Johns
Hopkins (1-0 on September 12)
and Villanova (4-3 on the 16th).
Eastern Mennonite will be the
second 0.D.A.C. opponent of the
season for the Generals when
they meet at 3:30 this Tuesday
on Wilson Field. Coach Pira-
nian does not expect the team to
dominate Mennonite like it has
in previous years. ‘‘They’re
much improved since last fall,
especially on offense.’ The
Royals have a 2-2 record to date
but are scheduled for two more
games before playing W&L.
Piranian believes that the

 

Generals’ chances for success

in these two home games will
depend on how well the team
practices this week. He adds,
“Our offense has performed
quite well thus far by taking ad-
vantage of most opportunities
and by keeping pressure on the
opponent’s goal area. We
believe that for us to have a
good season, the offense will
have to be our strength.”

 

The law school’s independent
and fraternities will field teams
in intramural competition
beginning this week. Football,
golf, and tennis will be the
sports this fall. Sigma Phi Ep-
silon won last year’s competi-
tion compiling 1186 of a possible
1400 points followed by Phi Kap-
pa Psi and Phi Delta Theta in
third.

The Generals in action at the Revue Fall Classic.

Polo Team Takes Second

“by G. Bruce Potter

The Washington & Lee water
polo team opened its season
with “a°4-1 record, good for se-
cond'place, in the Revue Fal
Classic last weekend. ,

The Generals dropped the
championship game to Slippery
Rock,.Pa., 13-5, but scored wins
over national powerhouses
California Tech, 11-9, and Ken-
tucky, 11-10.

The Kentucky game was
perhaps the most exciting of the
tournament as senior Mike Ber-
not netted his fourth goal of the
game with eight seconds left to
give the Generals the victory.
Co-captain Erik Peterson also
tallied four times as W&L re-
bounded from a 7-4 halftime
deficit.

Coach Page Remillard was
pleased with the victory over
Kentucky. “We didn’t plan it
quite that way (Bernot’s game-
winner), but we knew that!
California Tech, Kentucky, and’
we were about equal. We prov-
ed that the opponent can’t just!

stop one’ man (Peterson) and’

expect to beat us.” tC

California Tech jumped out to’

a quick 2-0 lead in the first
period against the Generals, but
four power play goals, two by
sophomore Rand McClain, gave
W&L a 5-4 halftime lead.

Only 53 seconds into the third
quarter, Cal Tech knotted the
score at five. Then Peterson

took over, scoring the first of his’

four goals that quarter at the
2:34 mark to give the Generals
a 6-5 lead that they would never

  

relinquish.

When the third quarter
onslaught had ended, W&L had
a 10-5 lead that Cal Tech could
not overcome, although _ it
scored three goals in a two-
minute span following Peter-
son’s departure from the game
with three fouls.

Peterson explained that he
had played conservatively dur-
ing the opening games of the
tournament, Johns Hopkins and
MIT, but was given ‘“‘the free-
dom to go outside”’ against Cal
Tech. He claimed that the Cal
Tech players were keying on
him when he got his second foul.

The Generals committed five
turnovers in the first three
minutes of the championship
finale against Slippery Rock,
and the Rockets’ tenacious de-
fense held them scoreless for
two of the first three quarters.
Slippery Rock took a 1-0 lead at
the 3:49 mark of the first period,
and W&L failed to convert on
two power plays later in the
quarter. The General§., would
squelch six more short-handed
opportunities before the game
ended.

Slippery Rock scored the first
tally early in the second period,
but the Generals came roaring
back on a goal by Bernot, who
finished the tournament with 16,

to cut the margin to 2-1. The
Rockets then scored three goals
within a minute and a half to
gain a commanding lead.

Down 6-3 at the half, W&L
came out of the locker room
hoping to effect a comeback.
But it was not to be as All-
American Tim Rock fouled out
15 seconds into the second half,
signalling the end of the Gen-
erals’ chances. The Rockets
would add three more goals in
the third quarter while shutting
out the Generals, and although
junior Bob Marshall came off
the bench to net two General
goals in the last minutes of the
game, it was too little, too late,
as Slippery Rock added four
goals themselves in a_ sub-
stitute-filled fourth quarter.

Remillard had labeled Slip-
pery Rock as_ the _ pre-
tournament favorite and the
Rockets lived up to their billing.
He denied that the Generals had
suffered a letdown following the
big wins over Cal Tech and Ken-
tucky, saying, ‘‘they wanted to
win, and this (loss) will help
next week in workouts.”

In their first: two games of
the tourney, W&L downed
Johns Hopkins, 15-11, and MIT,

15-6.

Famous Autographs
On Display In Library

A handwritten note signed
with a flourish by the incom-
parable Enrico Caruso. A reser-
vation for dinner bearing the
signature of Franz Liszt. An
1888 contract signed by Lillie
Langtry, better known as
“Jersey Lily,’’ alongside four
letters from her flamboyant
contemporary, Sarah Bern-
hardt. And a Christmas card
autographed by actor Lionel
Barrymore.

Those are a few of the items
‘nan unusual autograph collec-
tion that is currently on display
in the University Library at
Washington & Lee.

Autographs and letters signed
by actors and actresses, musi-
cians and composers, some dat-
ing back to the mid-1800s are
part of the collection donated to
the university by Carter N.
Bealer, who attended W&L
from 1918 to 1922.

Bealer, who died in 1965, be-
queathed his collection of col-
lections -- ranging from ship’s
menus to hotel stickers. — to the
university.

intl recently the Bealer col-

lections were collecting dust in
a storage room of the library.

But this summer Richard
Oram, reference and public ser-
vices librarian at W&L, began
combing through the contents of
the boxes of memorabilia.

Oram marvels at what he
found contained in those boxes.

“The scope of Mr. Bealer’s
collections is truly amazing,”
Oram said. ‘In addition to the
autographs of over a hundred
proriinent actors and actres-
ses, there is a collection of near-
ly 1,500 theatre programs
dating from 1860 until Mr. Beal-
er’s death in 1965. He also col-
lected autographed pictures of
performers, ranging from Al
Jolson to Noel Coward.

‘‘We are still in the process of
determining exactly what other
items we have in the collection,
but it is all rather fascinating.”’

The Bealer Autograph Collec-
tion is on display in the Univer-
sity Library’s. special collec-
tions room and is open to the
public daily from 9 am. — 5
p.m.

 

Sinfonia

(continued from page 4)

In 1961, Houtmann won first
prize in the Dimitri Mitropoulos
International Music Competi-
tion for Conductors in New
York. The prize brought with it
the position of assistant conduc-
tor, under Leonard Bernstein,
of the New York Philharmonic.

Since 1965, Houtmann has
been invited to conduct or-
chestras all over the world. In
his native France, he served as
conductor for the French Na-
tional Orchestras, the Philhar-
monique, the Colonne, the

Lamoureux. and the Rhone-
Alpes Philharmonic Orches-
tras. He has been guest conduc-
tor of the New York Philhar-
monic, the Atlanta Symphony,
the Oregon Symphony of
America as well as with or-
chestras in Europe and South
America.

The concert by the Richmond
Sinfonia is the first in a series of
six programs to be presented by
the Washington & Lee Universi-
ty Concert Guild this academic
year. Season tickets are still
available at $10 for all six con-
certs.

Alumni Make Donation

Two 1981 graduates of Wash-
ington & Lee University, Marc
Firestone of New York City and
David Finley of Dayton, O.,
made a noteworthy donation to
the university this fall.

Firestone and Finley, both
philosophy majors at W&L,
were named in June as co-
winners of The Young Scholar-
ship in Philosophy, which is
presented annually to the stu-
dent (or, in this instance,
students) writing the senior
thesis judged best by the
department. The scholarship
carries an annual value of $125.

Firestone and. Finley chose to
donate the proceeds from The
Young Scholarship to W&L’s
philosophy department, sug-
gesting that the contribution be
used to help furnish the new
philosophy seminar room in
recently renovated Newcomb
Hall.

As a result of the contribu-
tion, a wall-size mural showing
the earth as seen from a van-
tage point on the moon now
decorates the philosophy sem-

Debate

Tourney

A debating team representing
the College of William and
Mary won the varsity competi-
tion in the Washington & Lee
Debate Tournament last week-
end.

Davidson’s novice team won
over William and Mary in the
novice round. :

Twenty teams representing
nine schools_participated in the
novice and varsity divisions. In
addition to William and Mary
and Davidson, the schools re-
presented in the tournament
were the University of North
Carolina at Charlotte, West
Virginia University, Appala-
chian State University, Wake
Forest University, Liberty Bap-
tist College, Alderson-Broaddus
College, and Washington and
Lee.

The W&L tournament is the
first of the academic year in the
nation and gives competing
teams an early look at the
development of the national
topic that will be debated by col-
lege teams throughout the year.
This year’s topic is ‘‘Resolved:
That the Federal Government
should significantly curtail the
powers of labor unions.’’ Teams
debated the affirmative and
negative of that proposition dur-
ing the tournament.

—-Miss Liliian Spouts Off Again ——

A story went out on the AP wire last week in which excerpts from
an interview with Lillian Carter were published. In it, Mrs. Carter
attacked first lady Nancy Reagan for ruining the White House with
her Hollywood-style taste.

This came about when the matriarch of the Carter clan was ask-
ed to respond to reports that Mrs. Reagan was shocked by the con-
dition in which she found the executive mansion. Miss Lillian said
that Mrs. Reagan shocked her, that she didn’t know what kind of
taste Mrs. Reagan has, but she supposed it was Hollywood taste.

 

John Wells

 

 

TASTE

 

Now it is ironic that Miss Lillian, whose standard public attire is
a double-knit pants suit, should take it upon herself to criticize
anybody on grounds of taste. Since she labeled the Reagans’ taste

by using the name of their home base, it seems fair and appropriate -

to refer to her taste as Plains Taste.

;
(0)

Plains Taste left the White House ‘a$the Reagans found it

January 20: parquet floor and baseboard damage suffered when

Amy Carter converted the East Room into a roller-boogie rink for :

party held after her daddy’s humiliating defeat; reminders of a_

puppy the Carters kept for months but failed to housetrain; worn
furnishings and dirty walls from scores of Carter kin who lived |

there from time to time during four years,

So the Reagans found the place looking like a Holiday Inn suite
that had been rented and used by the entire Hee Haw Gang during

the previous term. Nancy hired decorator Ted Graber to fix the.

place up at the expense of a private fund set up by Reagan buddies.
Graber’s credits include the American Embassy in London. That's
Hollywood taste.

Plains Taste eschews Chippendale for Sears, damask for
polyester, walnut for plywood. It is interesting to note that the ex-
First Mother failed to criticize Nancy’s taste as exhibited by her
highly publicized wardrobe. Lillian, you’ll remember, made the
papers with her “JIMMY WON’”’ T-shirt in 1976. She was also her
son’s official representative at the funeral of the late Yugoslavian
President Tito, who, by anyone’s standards, was one of the most
significant political leaders of this century. For this solemn occa-
sion, Miss Lillian shunned international protocol (black dress and
gloves) for her Plains Taste rumpled tan J.C. Penny raincoat (also
her attire at Jimmy’s swearing-in — it looked real folksy next to
Betty Ford’s mink). :

Finally, the grande dame of Plains attacked Mrs. Reagan on the
groundless, false charge that the first lady plans to knock out a wall
in the Lincoln Bedroom. Apparently Miss Lillian is selective in
gathering information, choosing to believe what she wants and tak-
ing as fact idle gossip and lies. Her mindless public, all of whom
probably read the National Enquirer, will undoubtedly take her
pronouncements as unequivocal truth.

Miss Lillian, 82, stated in the interview that she found White
House living dull — walking, drinking, dining and watching T.V.
She expressed a fondness for the chamber always reserved for her
frequent visits, the Queen’s Bedroom. And a fitting room it must
have been for a woman as regal as Miss Lillian, who, after all, is
Queen of the Carter Tribe.

The Reagans have been roundly criticized for living sumptuously
while the president slashes away at social programs. The public
will be the ultimate’critic of their lifestyle. But for anyone to put
down their taste — especially one as utterly unqualified as Lillian
Carter — is a bit much. Her words should be taken for what they
are: sour grapes from an old prune.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK 2? Cheers

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Security

Security, or the lack thereof, is again becoming an
issue on this campus. At this time, however, all we
can offer is some good news and some bad news.

First the good news. Apparently the university has
conceded that security was lacking last year and has
added an extra man to its squad. New lights were add-
ed on the footbridge that connects the main campus
with the law school and the athletic fields. These are
both steps in the right direction.

Now for the bad news. Despite the improvements,
some of last year’s problems remain unsolved. Stu-
dents have already suffered incidents of vandalism in
the Woods Creek parking lot and the streets surroun-
ding the Student Center continue to be hunting
grounds for thieves, burglars, etc.

In the Woods Creek matter, perhaps the university
should consider a new method for patrolling the area.
While a zero crime rate is unlikely, the ability of a
group of thieves to strip a car of all its tires and go un-
noticed indicates that something is wrong.

As for the Student Center, newer and stronger
lighting would be a good first step. A request should
be made to the Lexington City Council to improve the
lighting of both Washington and Lee Sts. Meanwhile,
the university should install stronger lights on the out-
side of the building itself.

The university should be applauded for recognizing
the security problem and taking action. But if the
university believes that the security problem will now
disappear, it is infor a rude awakening.

Bids

This Friday night, many freshmen will be given an
option that can alter the course of their four years at
W&L. Bids can be accepted on Friday and one has to
wonder how many freshmen will tear before giving
the house of their choice a good and hard look.

We are neither commending nor condoning the fra-
ternity system. We only hope that Friday night’s
choice is one based on common sense, rather than im-
pulse. Joining a fraternity can be an expensive and
time-consuming endeavor. It is a decision not to be

taken lightly.
Changes

Readers with a flair for the artistic may have notic-
ed some changes in last week’s edition of the Phi.
Alterations were made in the masthead and sectional
logos to give the paper a more contemporary look.
Similarly, the comic strip ‘‘Doonesbury”’ has been ad-
ded as a weekly feature.

In these ways we hope to improve the quality of our
product. You may find typographical errors or other
miscues from week to week, but at least our public
knows that we are trying to raise the standards of this

publication.

For
Mr. Smith

Dear Editor:

Three cheers for Todd Smith,
and a couple of bids, too. His
observations about the rush
situation at W&L should be
given serious consideration.
Last week’s paper would have
been much more in tune with
things if its headline had been
‘Rush is Declared.”’

His central point, let rush be
delayed, would greatly benefit
this institution if acted upon.
The rush experience is
beneficial and needed at W&L.
However, the way it tends to
dominate the first month of the
school year is not in the in-
terests of the university or the
freshman class. Preconceived
ideas about the necessity of
rush being at the beginning of
the school year are the result of
rush having always been at the
beginning of the school year.

What are some possible ad-
vantages of students not being
literally rushed (blindly herd-
ed) into the fraternity system?
First of all, there would not be
the tremendous pressure on
freshmen to make such a monu-
mentous momentous social and
financial commitment so soon.

Delaying rush would allow
freshmen to develop a more ob-
jective view of the fraternity
system and to see which frater-
nity appealed to them, if any.
Without the tremendous
amount of energy and time
devoted to rush, the up-
perclassmen and freshmen
would have time to pursue some
of the extra-curricular ac-
tivities that interest them.

 

Delaying rush
would allow
freshmen to

of Woods Creek, it’s not so safe.

An atmosphere more in line
with the liberal ideals of the
university might be ignited;
students pursuing specialized
studies, working for the univer-
sity federation, i.e. an overall
decrease in student apathy.

Are generalities about the
liberal education at W&L re-
lated to the logistical position of
rush? This reader thinks so.
The university, the student
body, and the fraternity system
as a whole would benefit from a
delayed rush. Obviously, this
issue cannot be addressed in a
few newspaper articles. I sug-
gest that the E.C. or the Inter-
Fraternity Council or the ap-
propriate representative body
appoint a committee to re-
search this idea and consider its
possibilities.

Sincerely,

Symposium

Dear Editor:

In recent months, much time
and thought has been commit-
ted to answering the feasibility
of establishing a symposium or
convocation (i.e. a university-
wide consideration of a critical
public issue culminating in a
town meeting, a white paper,
and a competition). The con-
cept is similar in structure to
Washington & Lee’s Mock Con-
vention.

The University Council and
its various subcommittees have
investigated this proposal, and
determined several goals and
objectives: (1) A symposium
could help to unify the campus.
(2) Interdisciplinary learning
needs to take place.

(3) Critical thinking would be
encouraged.

(4) The symposium would
demonstrate that liberal educa-
tion takes place outside the
classroom as well as inside.

(5) Participation in seminars
and individualized research
would be encouraged.

(6) A symposium could re-
juvenate the spring term.

(7) It could guide academic or
career objectives for students.
(8) Opportunities for leadership
would be expanded.

(9) An intellectual symposium
would add a distinctive feature
to academic and student life at
Washington & Lee, much as the
Mock Convention does.

 

“It might live or
die depending on
the first topic...”

Dr. Thomas
Williams

 

What we envision is a
quadrennial event occurring
two years after every Mock
Convention. Research,
seminars, and _ independent
study would be designed in ac-
cordance with a selected topic,
to afford students and faculty
the opportunity to investigate
various aspects of the issue at
hand. Such topics could include
athletics and education, govern-
ment and the individual, and
world hunger, to name a few.

To assure the success of the
program, some type of ‘‘finale
weekend” would be planned,
featuring keynote speakers and
different activities. . The
highlight of the weekend would
be the production and presenta-
tion of a platform or white
paper which would attract the
interest of the media, and other
institutions.

This is merely a cursory in-
troduction to what could

“No, I don’t think it happened that way,’’ said the EcSec
(Newspeak for Executive Committee Secretary )

“‘T really do think that the Freshman Law elections were moved
back,’’ responded the RiPhHak (Ring-tum Phi journalist). But
Smith said it trembling. Was he the only one to remember it, a
minority of one?

Producing the minutes, the EcSec read that the motion had fail-
ed. He smiled as if to say, ‘There, your memory is undisciplined,
you thought criminal.”

No, no, no. Smith concealed his rapid breathing with ‘the
characteristic, moronic smile. He could remember talking to Willis
and Mackie. The two EcReps had said that to move up the Law
School Freshman Elections would fly in the face of the Constitution.

He remembered how then-president-elect Myers (now called Big’
Deadbear) had fought the constitution to move the
LawFreshEcRep elections to a date earlier in the year, thereby im-
proving representation.

‘‘The Constitution isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on,”’ expound-
ed Big Deadbear.

The EcSec read further. While the measure was later passed
claiming a loophole in the Consitution, it was subject to this year’s
ExCom’s approval. ‘‘We never reconsidered it,” said the EcSec. |"

‘Myers spoke against the motion, saying it flew in the face of the
constitution,” continued the EcRep. 4

watched from a small rectangular Big Budget on the wall. A ques-
tionable expression, a nervous twitch, or even a rapid heartbeat
could alert the Commandos. Every prole knows the fear of the mid-
night tromp of boots on stair and door, the dark hearing in the
catacombs, and the anonymous, traceless dissappearance, forever
wrapped in silence. With a poker-face, the RiPhHak found the
sliver of history he needed. It detailed a coup against last year’s
EcPres Willis, a.k.a. Big Boo Boo. At an April meeting, the ExCom
voted 6-4 against Big Boo Boo, Mackie, Nogay, and Hale, to move
LawFreshEcRep elections despite the coustitutional specifica-
tions.

Big Deadbear had become fed up with a student body that:would
not revise its constitution. Several elections throughout the year
failed to produce a majority of voters. Now, the fairirepresentation
of the LawProles, whose calendar had been changed since the
writing of the constitution, was at stake. “he ExCom voted for
fairness over constitutionality, and over Big +00 Boo.

A ghost appeared at the second ExComintern (meeting). Just
when you thought someone had become an unperson, they would
reappear for a year or two before dissappearing forever. So it was
with Steve Abraham. Once EcPres himself, Abraham reappeared
as a LawProle.

Abraham pleaded for earlier LawFreshEcRep elections,
LawFreshProles were i:: school for ten weeks before they had a peer
on the ExCom. All nodded yes, yes, a great discrepancy, and some
suggested having mone; votes on the constitution. “‘Another year
has passed,’’ noted Big Deadbear, ‘‘we will havetto try to change it
for next year,” which is just what Big Boo Boo had said before.

They had won the victory over indiscipline. They loved their con-

W&L Theatre to Hold
3 Major Productions

The Washington & Lee Uni-
versity Theatre will present
three major productions during
the 1981-82 academic year, be-
ginning with “The Country
Wife,’’ a comedy act in Restora-
tion England and scheduled for
Nov. 9-14 in the Troubadour
Theatre.

The other presentations of
W&L’s University Theatre will
' “Man. of La Mancha"
(March 22-27, 1982) and
‘Scapino!”’ (May 24-28, 1982).

The University Theatre will
hold an open house Tuesday,
Sept. 22, at 8 p.m. at the
Troubadour. Anyone interested
in working in any of the theatre
productions is invited to attend,
according to Albert C. Gordon,
professor of tine arts at W&L
and director uf the University
Theatre.

“All three of the productions
are open not only to W&L
studcuts, but to any member of
the Lexington community,”
Gordon explained. ‘In the open-
ing play, “The Country Wife,”’
there are seven parts for men
and seven for women. The

women’s parts are all very good
and are extremely varied.”’

Open auditions for ‘The
Country Wife’’ will be held at
the Troubadour Theatre on
Sept. 24 and 25 at 4:30 p.m. and
7 p.m. Gordon is the director for
the play.

Auditions will be announced
later for ‘‘Man of La Mancha”’
anc: “Scapino!"’. Gordon will be
the director for ‘““Man of La
Mancha,”’ the musical comedy
based on Cervantes’ Don Quix-
ote and his ‘impossible
dreams.”’ Paula Langdon, in-
structor in drania, will direct
‘‘Scapino!”’ a modern stage ver-
sion Of Moliere’s farce,
“Seapin,”’

In addition to the three major
productions, the University.

Theatre will also present an

original work by a W&L student

Dorm Experiences

some cases, students have
taken out one desk in order to
create some more room.

Hunter Benes lives on the
first floor of Gilliam. He is occu-
pying one of the smallest rooms
on campus. Benes said that it is
hard having a roommate
because there’s not much room.
He goes to the library to study.
In describing his room, Benes
stated, ‘‘It’s liveable, I guess.’
He also proved that he’s a sensi-
ble student when he said ‘I’m
not going to transfer because of
it (the room).”

“This isn’t at all what I ex-
pected,’’ said Andy Haring, who
resides in a room on the top
floor of Gilliam. Last year when
he visited the campus, his guide
showed him nice rooms with
one person in each of them.
“Then I came here and saw my
cubicle, and it was a less-than-
pleasant surprise,’’ he remark-
ed. Haring knows that he has no
choice except to live in his room
and make the best of it. But he
spends very little time in his
“cubicle”, saying, “It’s just
basically a place for me to
sleep.”

Andy Berisford is another
resident of a crowded room in
Gilliam Dorm.

“It took a lot of adjusting,’’ he
said. Speaking about his rela-
tionship with his roommate,
Randall Ray, Berisford com-
mented, ‘‘The main thing is we
have to work at not getting on
each. other’s nerves, because
we're living on top of each other
like this.”

Berisford studies in the
library and he noted that there
is no room for his stereo in his
room, although his roommate
has one. Their room is crowded
with furniture, with everything
crammed against everything
else. They share a rather small
closet and towels can’t be hung
on the towel rack because the
dresser is right next to it.
Berisford said that his room-
mate doesn’t complain to him
about the conditions.

Berisford has also learned to
live with a room of such small
size. ‘I’ve had to adjust from
the beginning,”’ he said. ‘I’m a
rather adaptive person. What
else can you do (except
adapt)?”

Judging by the comments of
the residents of the smallest
rooms in Gilliam, W&L fresh-
men have quickly learned to ad-
just to the conditions. The dorm
counselors have noticed that
some students just make jokes
about the living space in
Gilliam, or lack of it, in this
situation.

It is almost certain, and Dean
Huntley is aware, that the most
difficult time will come during
mid-terms and final exams. Un-
til then, the students living in
the small rooms of Gilliam will
just have to continue to adapt
and adjust. And the students in
the larger rooms of Gilliam will
probably continue to make com-
ments similar to one Barry
Whitaker made. Referring to
the small rooms occupied by his
neighbors, he declared, ‘I’m
glad I’m not in one of those.’’

Reps. to Host Picnic Sat.

The Washington & Lee Col-
lege Republicans will have their
Annual Fall Picnic this Satur-
day on the Law School Field
from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Enter-
tainment will be provided by
the Halls of Grass. Guests are to
include College Republicans
from Hollins, Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College, Sweet Briar,
Mary Baldwin, William &
Mary, Virginia Tech and
others.

“All W&L students interested
in the political process and

responsible government are en-
couraged to attend,”’ said Club
President Kelly Niernberger.
Club memberships will be
available at the picnic. In addi-
tion, members who have not yet
paid their dues will be asked to
do so at that time.

Campaign Chairman Dennis
Roberts characterized the An-
nual Picnic as the ‘‘kick-off for
our efforts in the fall guber-
natorial campaign. With the
Democratic candidate for

LruE BEST FOR FALL - 1981

only at

governor making threatening
statements about private
education in Virginia, it is im-
perative that we defeat those
who are a menace to our in-
terests,’’ Roberts concluded.

Niernberger urges everyone
to ‘‘come on out to what should
be the best pre-game warm-up
of the season. Then join us at
Wilson Field as our own Gen-
erals take on Centre College. It
should be a grand old time for
the Grand Old Party.”
