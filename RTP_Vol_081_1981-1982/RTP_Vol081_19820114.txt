“A mammoth undertaking”
are the words of Student Activi-
ty’s Board (SAB) Co-Chairman
John Martin in expressing the
75th annual Fancy Dress Ball.
Indeed, said Martin, this year’s
ball will be an event ‘“‘un-
precedented in SAB history.”’

Co-Chairmen Martin and
Blake Witherington along with
University Center chairman
Bob Schmidt are faced with a
precarious situation. Because
the 75th annual is to take place
in W&L’s Warner Gymnasium,
as opposed to the Student
Center where the Ball has been
held in previous years, the SAB
has no past records by which to
base its projected budget.

 

Fancy Dress Move
Complicates Plans

Since the gymnasium is able
to accommodate a_ greater
number of people, the amount
of supplies needed for decora-
tions, furnishings, and lighting
equipment must simply be
estimated at best. The SAB is
relying heavily upon a large at-
tendance in order to compen-

sate for much of the $55,000. be-

ing spent to finance the occa-
sion.

Whereas other Fancy Dress
balls have been limited solely to
W&L students and faculty, this
year’s endeavor will also in-
clude alumni and friends. An
estimated 4,000 people are ex-
pected to fill the gymnasium
and the SAB stresses for those

Mrs. Miller To Leave

Secretary to the Dean of
Students Betty Miller will leave
her job at the end of this month.

“It’s just time,”’ Mrs. Miller
said when asked why she ‘is
leaving. She plans to ‘‘take it
easy for a few months’’ and
then seek part-time employ-
ment elsewhere.

Mrs. Miller is perhaps better
known than most campus secre-
taries because she deals direct-
ly with a broad cross section of
the student body. Freshmen ap-
preciate having their names
remembered by someone who
reminds them of their best
friend’s mom. Her cheerful
smile and consoling words have
sent more than a few students
into Dean Lewis John’s office to
discuss academic difficulties.

‘‘We’re going to miss her very
much around here,’’ Dean John
said earlier this week. Similar
thoughts were expressed by
Dean Robert Huntley and
scores of students.

Mrs. Miller came to W&L in

Old Man Winter Hits Big Lex

Harsh winter conditions have
made life in Lexington difficult,
if not hazardous, during the
past week. Last weekend’s sub-
zero temperatures and brisk
winds were followed by a storm
that dumped snow on Lexington
Tuesday night and all day
Wednesday. At the last count,
the storm had left aproximately
eight inches of snow on the
ground.

The W&L infirmary reports
that the past week has not been
the best as far as students’
health is concerned. The
number of flu cases has increas-
ed and many students have
been bothered with a stomach
virus. The infirmary recom-
mends dressing warmly before
going outside and keeping as
much of the body covered as
possible.

The secretary’s job will be
filled by Penny Henneman, wife
of the assistant law school dean
and a leader in the local United
Way.

Mrs. Miller received a Ring-
tum Phi award in 1980,

E.C. Ponders Reports,
Gets New Speaker List

by Ben Jarratt

Contact announced several
guest speakers at Monday
night’s Executive Committee
meeting.

The E.C. also heard reports
from the Ring-tum Phi, the In-
ternational Club, the Outing
Club and the Fencing Club.

Mike Drinkwater and Robert
McLean, co-chairmen of Con-
tact, stated their committee has
signed the following speakers:

—Arthur Miller, professor of
law at Harvard, on Jan. 26.

—F. Lee Bailey, one of the na-
tion’s top defense lawyers, on
Feb. 4.

—Robert Hughes, art critic
for Time Magazine, on March 31.

Contact is sponsored jointly
by the Interfraternity Council
and the Executive Committee.
The first speaker this: year,
Stewart Udall, cost over $2,200.
This figure included an

honorarium fee, transportation,
dinner and reception. The se-
cond speaker, George Gallup,
cost over $2,500.

Both Drinkwater and McLean
said that Contact’s budget
should last to the end of the
school year. Out of a beginning
budget of $19,925, Contact has
spent over $6,600 on speaker
fees and other expenses.

“We are looking into the
possibility of having F. Lee
Bailey in Evans Dining Hall,”
stated Drinkwater. ‘‘The dining
hall has a greater seating
capacity than Lee Chapel,
which holds only 550 people.”’

Trent Dickerson, business
manager for the Ring-tum Phi,
presented the newspaper’s
budget report. The Phi had ex-
penses totaling $3,500.

Dickerson said ‘tthe Phi may

Gallup Analyzes Reagan Popularity

by Todd Smith

President Reagan’s approval
rating in polls of the American
public has slipped below the 50
percent mark for the first time
in his administration, said
pollster George Gallup Jr.
Thursday, Jan. 7.

Speaking at Lee Chapel,
Gallup said that Reagan’s first-
year average in the popularity
polls is slightly below those of
Jimmy Carter and Richard Nix-
on ‘‘and is considerably lower
than the first-year ratings given
John Kennedy and Dwight

Eisenhower.”’

“Yet, while the President’s
overall job performance rating
has been ona slide, three in four
Americans continue to express
approval of President Reagan
aS a person,’ said Gallup.
Gallup, 50, is the president of
the Gallup Poll, founded in 1935
by his father.

Gallup’s surveys show that
Reagan is ‘“‘less popular with
non-whites than any president
in the last half century.’’ While
55 percent of whites polled ex-
pressed approval of Reagan’s

job-handling, only 12 percent of
non-whites do.

“Growing pessimism’’ over
Reagan’s economic program
has been a key factor in his
popularity’s downward trend.
Gallup said Reagan's approval
rating has lost 19 percent since
May of last year. Despite
decreasing popularity,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

 

 

Delayed Rush

On Tuesday night, the Interfraternity Council
brought up the question of postponing rush from the
first four weeks of the school year to the beginning of
the second semester. The idea was raised by Assis-
tant Dean of Students Dan Murphy, who said that a
faculty member of the University Council had made
the same suggeston.

We believe this is a legitimate question that needs
to be studied in detail by a committee. We hope that
the IFC will have the wisdom to select a committee
comprised of both fraternity members and freshmen
and non-fraternity members to study the question.

When the idea of a delayed rush was discussed at
Tuesday night’s meeting, most of the attending house
representatives immediately balked at the offer. Only
the speech of a dorm counselor, who claimed that
some freshmen didn’t like the current rush process,
kept the talk alive. This seems to indicate that a
variety of students, not a small clique, could best ex-
amine this matter.

Delaying rush is a topic that cannot be handled with
a simple vote. A committee study would provide in-
sight to a question that could ultimately rearrange
much of this school’s social structure.

We believe the IFC is on the correct route so far.
Hopefully the route will end with an impartial and
trenchant study of the question.

The following article was
reprinted from the Nov. 18 issue
of “The Guardsman,” the campus
newspaper of the City College of

_ San Francisco.

All Saturday classes for
Spring Semester will be cancell-
ed.

The economy cutbacks which
hover over the nation like a
giant insect, sets the first of its
many legs down here at City
College with the removal of 74
Saturday classes from _ the
Spring Semester. The crunch,
which will be felt by 2300
students, came only after
‘“‘serious discussion and
deliberation,” says Dean War-
ren White of the Evening Divi-
sion.

The reduction in the number
of classes on Saturday will save
$55,000 in an attempt to stay
within the budget for the fiscal
year 81-82. Dean White says,
‘‘People don’t like their lives in-
terfered with.’’ But students
now enrolled in Saturday
classes will have to reschedule
for their Spring evening
classes. Saturday classes are
attended mainly by working
people who for various reasons
have a hard time making it to
class during the week.

By removing the Saturday
classes Dean White states, ‘‘It’s
the least disruptive way to stay
within the budget. The state
allows for only a two-percent
growth, and City College has
shown a three-percent growth.
At present, all the buildings on

classes. This brings in overtime
for janitors, maintenance peo-
ple and 74 part-time teachers.
After January, only the library

and the computer center will be
open on Saturday, for it is felt
that they are for all the students
all the time and should there-
fore be available to them.”

Students’ House Burns

by Tom Baker

A house that was being rented
by three Washington and Lee
University students burned to
the ground early in the morning
of Dec. 27.

The house, owned by William
Meocham, and rented by Jay
Irons, Alex McAlister and Ware
Palmer, was on Va. Rte. 624.

Fire Department Chief Payne
Poindexter, who described the
fire as ‘“‘a total loss,” said the
house was unoccupied at the
time because the students were

away on Christmas break.

The fire required the efforts
of both the Kerrs Creek
Volunteer Fire Department and
the Lexington-Rockbridge Fire
Department to extinguish.

The state arson investigation
is still trying to determine the
origin of the fire.

According to Palmer, the
three students have already
found another house to live in
and are currently waiting for
money from their insurance to
pay for their destroyed goods.

Univ. Services Moves

by Greg Coy

The office of University Ser-
vices at W&L is moving to the
first floor of Graham-Lees Dor-
mitory by March 1.

The office is currently located
in Washington Hall. The new
location will be what was
formerly a television room on
the east side of the dormitory,
which is currently being
renovated and should be in
operation for the fall semester
of 1982.

University Services is being

crowded out of Washington Hall
by the Treasurer’s office, which
has shared the same area in the
past. University Treasurer
Stewart Epley is planning to in-
stall computer terminals in the

office for administrative
assistance.
Although the office is

spacious enough to accomodate
three administrators and two
secretaries, the terminals have
Squeezed out the University
Services’ staff.

 

 
IFC Discusses. Delayed Rush

by Steve Perry

Assistant Dean of Students
Dan Murphy asked fraternity
representatives at Tuesday
night’s Interfraternity Council
meeting to consider the possi-
bility of delaying rush to the se-
cond semester of the academic
year. Rush is currently held in
the first four weeks of the school
year.

Murphy stated that freshmen
might benefit from the chnage
in several ways. Murphy said
incoming students would be
able to ‘‘get their feet on the
ground”’ before the hectic rush
period began. Murphy added
that a delayed rush might give
freshmen an accurate picture of
fraternity life.

Dave Moore of Kappa Alpha
stated that rush would, in all
probability, continue regard-

less of the rule on an informal
basis. Lou Close of Delta Tau
Delta added that the rule
change would pose a greater
financial burden on the frater-
nities because the dues normal-
ly paid in the fall by pledges
would have to be paid by the
brothers.

Todd Smith, a dorm coun-
selor, came out in favor of a
rules change. Smith cited
several instances in which he,
as a dorm counselor, was con-
fronted by freshmen who were
disatisfied by the choices they
had made or felt cheated, in
general, by the rush process.
Smith also suggested that a
committee be organized to ex-
amine the feasibility of a rules
change.

In other business, the IFC
discussed its role in the upcom-

ing Muscular Dystrohy Dance-
athon. In the past, W&L frater-
nities have each donated two
kegs of beer to the dance. Tripp
Brower, Danceathon  Chair-
man, suggested that each
fraternity determine the size of
its donation. Fraternities were
also encouraged to plan their
social calendars around the
event.

Sigma Phi Epsilon was the
only house to appear before the
IFC’s judicial board. SPE was
charged with a noise violation
at 2:30 a.m. of Dec. 6. The
fraternitiy did not contest the
citation while before the board
and was given two weeks of
social probation.

IFC President Hall Vetterlein
stated that further discussion of
the possibility of a delayed rush
will occur at the next meeting.

Student Invents New Pack

A unique book and gear pack
invented by a W&L student is
being sold here by the inven-
tor’s younger brother.
Freshman Cameron Adams
says the Rapsack Pack allows
people to carry more books or
equipment with a minimum
amount of effort.

The pack, which comes in two
models, was invented by Bryan
Adams, who dropped out of
W&L as a junior to pursue its
development. The pack folds
out into a_ flattened. table
capable of holding significant
amounts of books or gear. The
pack folds around the waist,
fastened in front, supporting the
gear from the outside and
allowing the arms more free-
dom of movement. The pack
was developed with skiers,
bikers, skaters, hikers, runners

and students in mind.

Other advantages of the pro-
duct are that the cargo stays
organized, does not bang
together, and the load does not
shift to knock the owner off
balance. The pack is positioned
to integrate the cargo’s weight
with the owner, making it
easier to carry.

The younger Adams says his
brother still hopes to sell the
company to a larger company
or entrepeneur and return to
school. The Rapsack Pack has
been reveiwed by several
marketing firms with favorable
reports, according to Adams.
Bryan Adams’ business, Rabbit
Transit, is located Char-
lottesville and the packs are
manufactured in Roanoke.

Area Hit By Break-ins

by Tom Baker

The Washington and Lee com:
munity was plagued by a rash
of break-ins over the recent
two-week break.

The Beta Theta Pi fraternity,
the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity,
the College Inn, and several stu-
dent houses were all broken into
over the past few weeks.

According to Lexington
Police Chief James A. Kirby,
the Beta Theta Pi house was
broken into on approximately
Dec. 29. Kirby said the in-
truders entered the house
through a bathroom window on
the third floor. Rodney Taylor,
a member of that fraternity,
said that six rooms had been
broken into and several posses-
sions, including a stereo, watch-
es, albums, cash and clothes,
had been taken from the rooms.

Eleven rooms were broken in-

to at the Pi Kappa Alpha house,

The Washington and Lee
Biology department was named
as principle benefactor by the
will of its late professor, Gary
H. Dobbs III.

The popular professor shot
and killed himself on the morn-
ing of Dec. 31, leaving a letter to
the president of the university
citing his dissatisfaction with
his personal and professional
achievement.

The value of Dobbs’ estate
will not be tallied for four to six
weeks, according to university
attorney Eric Sisler.

Bequeathing his hunting and
fishing equipment to friends
and his collection of American
coins to the Indian Springs
School, Dobbs stipulated in his
will that the remainder of his
estate be sold and placed in a
special fund.

Dobbs directed the Biology
department to use this fund for
the purchase of 15 pieces of
equipment listed in the will. The
items include a centrifuge, a
computing densitometer and an
eight-passenger Ford van for
field trips.

Sisler said that these pur-
chases cannot be made until the
estate is settled and the taxes
paid. He said that this could

 

Dobbs’ Will Detailed

take up to a year. The Biology
department would then have
three years in which it must buy
the equipment.

The list of 15 items is very
carefully detailed with brand
names and serial numbers.
Dobbs had his will dated and

witnessed on Dec. 17, 1981.

In the will, Dobbs directed
that his body be cremated and
scattered on the front campus.
He forbade the university from
making public statements or
holding a memorial service.

In the will, Dobbs wrote, ‘‘I
have profound gratitude toward
my alma mater, Washington
and Lee University, a devotion

_ to its highest ideals, and a deep

affection for my teachers, col-
leagues, students, and friends
there.

Blood Drive To Begin Here

by Bill Woolfolk

If you haven’t seen the
posters yet, look again: the Red
Cross is going to hold another
Blood Drive at W&L. If you
have already decided not to par-
ticipate or if you are still
undecided, the following infor-
mation may provide a new in-
sight into the Red Cross Blood
Program.

The Red Cross was first
licensed by the federal govern-
ment to collect blood after
World War II. This licensing re-
quires only two things of the
Red Cross: that they supply
free blood to all askers if they
have it on hand and that they
supply all types of aid to
military families that require
it.

Many advancements have
been made since the war in the
storage and processing of blood.
Maximum storage life of a unit
of blood is now 35 days and Red
Cross blood supplies are used in
everything from cancer radia-

tion treatment to helping

Blood is needed in greater
quantities in surgery to pro-
mote healing and is used at all
hours of the day and night to
save the lives of accident vic-
tims. Blood has so many ap-
plications today that its collec-
tion, processing and storage has
become the main service of the
United States Red Cross.

What is done with the blood
that is collected? The Red Cross
subjects every drop to 11 dif-
ferent tests, checking for Rh
factors, blood type and abnor-
malities in the constituent
elements of the blood. The blood
is then supplied to hospitals
which are part of the Red Cross
system. If there is a surplus of
blood the Red Cross supplies
hospitals that are not part of the
system and sometimes sends
blood to other countries in need.

Suitable for 3-4 students, $125 per student. 1 year

surpluses are hard to predict, a
continual collection system

How much blood does the Red
Cross collect? Last year the
Red Cross collected 1,953 units
in Rockbridge County alone. In
the Appalachian region, of
which Rockbridge County is a
part, the total was 51,105 units.
Nationally, the Red Cross
received 5,629,477 units. Only
1.3 percent of that total was not
used due to the presence of
diseases and abnormalities in
the blood.

Still it is not enough.

Stop and think; probably
someone you know has had
surgery requiring large
amounts of blood. If they did,
more than likely the blood they
received was due to the efforts
of the American Red Cross. It
all boils down to saving people:
strangers, friends, family,
maybe even you.

The Voice Of The Generals

By John Cleghorn

Ken Ries sat in his office late
Tueeday afternoon buried in
thought. This particular time he
was working on the spring
sports poster. Another time it
could have been a program for
that night’s basketball game or
a Statistical analysis of the foot-
ball team. Whatever it has to do
with W&L sports, he has likely
designed it, written it, compiled
it, or just stored it away for
future purposes. Ken Ries
humbly summarizes his job as
Washington and Lee Sports In-
formation Director as stories,
Stats, publications, and repor-
ting, but it goes a lot further
than that.

The university puts a lot of
faith in the young,’’ remarks
Ries, now in his fourth year as
S.1.D. After working in the
sports information office and
completing his work at Furman
University Ries was hired by
W&L only a month after his
graduation. Although the drop
from a Division One school toa

’ Division Three school may not

be an ideal one for an S.I.D.,
Ken Ries is more than satisfied.

“W&L is among the top in
academics and athletics,” says
Ries,’ | am not talking about
wins and losses, but about the
athletics and the commitment
by the university to the student-
athlete.”

In his first year at W&L, Ries
worked to gain a grasp of the
university sports. ‘‘I knew how
to do the job, but realizing the
needs of each sport was the first

thing I had to do,”’ Ries com-
ments, ‘‘What’s best is the con-
tinuity.”’

“The university has always
done the best they can for
ahtletes. It’s a nice picture.”’

Is it any different covering an
all male sports program after
Furman? “There is no dif-
ference when it comes down to
it,” says Ries. ‘‘Coaches will
always have X number of
players and X number of
games. A coach is somewhat
sheltered, the tasks for which
he works don’t change.”

In his two and years at
Washington and Lee there has
been only one head coaching
change and Ken Ries admits
that has made his job “a lot
smoother.’’ But in his close in-
volvement with W&L athletics
Ries ‘has noticed one change
and that is a higher intensity in
the approach towards recruit-
ing. ‘There has really been an
increase in the number of
brochures used by the coaches
in recruiting,’’ remarks Ken,
“the race is really getting
faster. The coaches are having
to spend a lot more time to get
the student athlete.”

The job of a Sports Informa-
tion Director is largely to
publicize each event and team,
but at W&L where the atten-
dance is lower than average,
that job is not'an easy one.

“Say you're from Califor-
nia,”’ explains Ries, ‘‘and W&L
is playing Lynchburg. You don’t
know diddly. It’s hard to get in-
terested. Some might say that’s

my job, maybe so, but if  in-
terest in the sport is not there its
hard to cultivate. I can give you
stickers, posters, and brochures
but its not necessarily going to
get you there.”’

‘‘Another thing is that people
won't go to see their friends,”
continues Ries, ‘‘even when
people know individuals that
are playing they won’t go. You
rarely see fraternities out there
backing their brothers. It’s fun-
ny, W&L has the best athletic
program in the conference but
I’m not sure whether everybody
takes good advantage of it
—whether to play or to watch.”’

In may ways Ken Ries
recognizes the large gap be-
tween athletics and the student
body at Washington and Lee. To
play a sport at W&L takes a lot
of dedication, which it should,

When the Washington & Lee
University swim team jumps
back into action this weekend
after taking a month-long break
from competition, the Generals
will be facing two of the more
powerful teams in the region.

On Friday evening, Jan. 15
the Generals will battle James
Madison University at 7 in the
VMI pool. On Saturday the 16th
W&L will entertain Towson
State University at 2 p.m. in the
Cy Twombly Pool.

‘‘January is not a time to rest,
so we've arranged for top-notch
competition to give us the
challenges we need,” explains
third-year head coach Page
Remillard, whose team will
also swim two dual meets dur-
ing each of the following two
weekends. ‘‘By the time we face
Madison and Towson we'll have
20 days of intense training
under our belts. We’ll be ready
to see what we can do.”

W&L and Madison both par-
ticipated in the Virginia State
Championship meet held in ear-
ly December at the W&L pool,
Madison taking a third-place
finish in the eight-team field
and W&L a fifth-place showing.
“JMU’s program is on the
upswing. Head coach Charlie
Arnold has done some good
recruiting and hired a fine
assistant. The Dukes are a good

 

Swimmers To
Resume Action

model for us because I feel that
we're at the point they were two
years ago. I hope we continue to
follow their lead,’’ comments
Remillard.

Towson State, meanwhile, is
equally if not more impressive.
The Tigers posted a 12-0 dual
meet record last winter in-
cluding a sound decision over
WA&L. ‘‘And they are undefeated
again this season,” informs
Remillard, who points to sud-
den recruiting success as the
basis for Towson’s strength.

Turning to the Generals,
Remillard and newly-acquired
assistant David Kent hope they
emerge from these three week-
ends of dual meet competition
at 3-3. “If we can do that, we'll
be right on schedule with our
goals, one of which is to get a
winning dual meet record,’’ of-
fers the head coach. W&L cur-
rently stands 1-0, the win com-
ing over VMI in November.

W&L SWIM TEAM
SCHEDULE CHANGES: One
meet has been added, one
dropped from the Generals’
current schedule. On Friday,
Jan. 29, W&L will be host to
Shippensburg State at 7 p.m. in
the Cy Twombly Pool. The Feb-
ruary 5 meet against Davidson
College has been cancelled at
Davidson’s request.

 

Prior to last Tuesday night’s
match, W&L leads the series
with Hampden-Sydney, which
dates back to 1964, 18-13. This
tight series has always produc-

. ed close ball games. Nine of the

matches have been within three
points .

In the last issue of the Phi it
was noted that the Washington
and Lee lacrosse team debuted
in 1977, which is obviously in-
correct. The lacrosse team
opened in 1940 while the water
polo team played its first games
in 1977.

Cavalline Hopes To
RecoverFor Baseball

by Rick Swagler

Chris Cavalline, tailback for
the W&L football team and
Shortstop for the baseball team,
-is in the process of recovering
from an injury sustained in the
last football game of the season.
Cavalline said that he ‘‘didn’t
know how it happened. I didn’t
get hit or anything.”’

The injury is known as the
anterior compartment syn-
drome and is similar to a blood
clot. The injury leaves the foot
disfunctional and requires ap-
proximately four months
recovery time.

Cavalline’s future for the
W&L baseball team is uncer-
tain. Cavalline has been exer-
cising the leg and naturally
hopes the leg will be fully
operable by the time the season
begins. As for the 1982 football
season, Cavalline is positive he
will be 100-percent for the
season’s opener.

As unfortunate as the injury
may have been, it is fortunate
that it did not interfere with
Cavalline’s athletics any more
than it has. As he puts it, ‘‘it was
just one of those freak things.”

Cagers Win Sixth Straight

by G. Bruge Potter

One of the time-honored
dogmas of basketball is that a
good team must be able to shoot
well from the foul line. But don’t
tell that to the Washington and
Lee roundball squad — they
already know.

The Generals’ last three op-
ponents, Bethany and Haver-
ford in the W&L Invitational
and Hampden-Sydney College
on Tuesday night, all outscored
W&L from the floor. But Verne
Canfield’s team hit 81.1% of its
free throws in those games
compared to its opponents’
64.2% en route to improving its
record to 6-3 and evening its
ODAC mark at 1-1 with the 63-56
victory over the archrival
Tigers at the Warner Center.
The Generals had downed
Bethany 73-65 and Haverford
68-51 over the weekend to cap-
ture the Invitational title for the
seventh time in the last 13
years.

H-SC took an early lead
against the Generals, but
George Spears’ jumper with
3:19 left in the half gave W&L
their first lead at 19-18. Spears,
who led all scorers with 20
points, connected on two free
throws, and John Lee Graves,
who scored 11 points and pulled

down nine rebounds, hit a
jumper from the right corner at
the halftime buzzer as’ W&L
took a 23-18 lead into the locker
room at the half.

Three minutes into the second
half, it was a brand new
ballgame as the Tigers cut the
Generals’ lead to one, 28-27, on a
three-point play. Two more foul
shots by Spears, who finished
with 14, and a three-point play
by Ken Jaffe put the Generals
up 35-32.

Spears and Brian Hanson
then scored four points each to
spark an 11-2 scoring spree that
gave the squad its biggest lead
at 47-34 with 7:07 remaining.
But hold everything. H-SC
erupted for an 8-1 spree of their
own, and when W&L took a
timeout with 5:57 left, they were
only up by eight, 48-40, setting
the stage, apparently, for an ex-
citing finish.

But that was not to be as the
teams spent the final five
minutes fouling at both ends of
the floor. W&L hit nine of ten
shots from the stripe in that
span and the closest the Tigers
came was within four at 54-50
with 1:59 left in the game.

Sophomore guard Chris
Baldwin had the ball stolen
from him on the Generals next

 
  
  

possession, but the Hampden-
Sydney player was tied up and
the ball went to W&L on the new
alternate possession rule. H-SC
proceded to steal the ball again,
but a Tiger stepped out of
bounds and Spears’ jumper
with 1:17 -remaining iced the
game. Jaffe, who scored a
career high 11 points, brought
the crowd to its feet with a steal
and a drive down the length of
the floor for an uncontested
layup as time expired.

Washington and Lee only shot
48.4% from the floor, but hit 33
of 45 free throw attempts
(73.3%) to H-SC’s 45.4%. The
Generals committed 24 per-
sonal fouls to the Tigers’ 30.

For the first time in his
coaching career, Canfield
started a small, three-guard
lineup against Haverford in the
final of the W&L Invitational on
Saturday night. And it worked,
as the team scored ten straight
points midway through the se-
cond half to come from a 14-8
deficit to take an 18-14 lead.

The rest was history as the
Generals continued to build on
their lead, took the biggest lead
of the game at 58-40 with 5:49
left, and walked away with a
68-51 win. Haverford came into
the tourney with the top defense

To Ga. Tech

by John Harrison
The Washington and Lee
wrestling team will reach what
the team captain calls ‘‘the
peak of our season as far as
competition goes’ this Satur-
day when it takes part in the
Georgia Tech Invitational in
Atlanta. In addition to the host
school, competition will be pro-
vided by Duke, V.M.I., Ten-
nessee Tech, Jacksonville State
(Ala.), Ohio Northwestern, and

Pembroke State (N.C.).

“It’s no secret we'll face
some big guns in Atlanta,”’ of-
fers ninth-year W&L_ head
coach Gary Franke. W&L and
Ohio Northern will be the only
NCAA Division III members in
the Invitational. “Our em-
phasis, clearly, will be on in-
dividual performances. We
hope to have several of our

wrestlers pick up wins.”’

The Generals had trouble last
week at Cambell College
matching weights. Freshman
Ron Thornton, who would nor-
mally compete in the 126-pound
division, was forced into the 134
category. Freshman Joe
O'Neill (34-12) and Carlton
Peebles (34-11) were the only
Generals able to score at all
against the Camels. The situa-
tion improved slightly Saturday
at Duke, with everyone manag-
ing to score and Thornton pull-
ing out a 6-5 decision.

“They were the two toughest
teams we will face this year,”
said Valliere, ‘‘and showed it.’
Jeff Dixon and Joe O'Neill did
pretty well. They just happened
to match up against two tough
guys. Carlton was in the same
position.”

Review:

An Overrated Meryl Streep

by Michael Judge

Director Karl Reizs’  in-
telligent and magnificently
visualized, but ultimately

disappointing, screen adapta-
tion of The French Lieutenant’s
Woman develops as an ex-
amination of the past as a con-
stant metaphor for the present,
and as a thoughtful exploration
of the timeless and enigmatic
qualities of love between the
sexes. By its conclusion,
however, the film has replaced
these, its vital and compelling
thematic aspects, with an all-
too familiar dose of feminist
rhetoric.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman is based on John
Fowles’ 1968 novel of the same
name. In the novel, Fowles
combines a modern narrative
technique with 20th century
hindsight to tell a Victorian love
story, departing from his nar-
rative at times to refer to
modern developments in
science and medicine, and to
such 20th century figures as
Freud and Henny Moore.
Fowles uses these references to
comment upon, and give a
deeper clarity of meaning to,

Sarah,

his Victorian plot and_ its
characters; calling upon the
present to illuminate the past
and, adversely, creating in the
reader a haunting sensation of
the past continuously influenc-
ing the present which grew
from it.

The film tries to duplicate this
element of hindsight by presen-
ting two simultaneous plots —
one Victorian, one modern —
through the device of a film
within a film: Meryl Streep, in

her most overrated perfor-:

mance to date, plays both
the mysterious and
romantically tragic heroine of
the novel, and Anna, the
American actress who is por-
traying her in a film version of
the book. Similarly, Jeremy
Irons brilliantly plays both
Charles, the hero of the Vic-
torian story, and Mike, the
modern British actor who plays
him on the screen.

This technique of juxtaposing
two interdependent plots in one
film, though hardly new to The
French Lieutenant’s Woman, is
developed in it with surprising
sophistication and __ lucidity;
from the opening shot the inten-

tions of the film are made clear.
We see Streep, dressed in
costume as Sarah, standing
before a hand-held mirror as
the last dabs of makeup are
placed on her face. The long
black cloak that she wears and
the drooping hood that frames
her face mark her as a woman
from another century. Sudden-
ly, with a loud snap, a clapper
board intrudes into the frame,

. announcing the commencement

of another days shooting. With
this explanatory — and highly
effective — union of images the
film begins.

Streep’s Sarah is a woman op-
pressed by the harsh moral
strictures of her day; she has
been degraded in the eyes of her
provincial society by an earlier
affair with a French lieutenant,
who has deserted her. Yet she
clings to her individuality and
to the memory of her vanished
love with mournful dignity.
Every day she stands at the end
of a long, snake-like jetty,
draped in black like a figure
from a Dore engraving, waiting
for her lover’s return. It is here
that Charles, a young well-to-do
Englishman, first lays eyes on
Sarah while walking with his
fiancee — and from this mo-

PEEP EREEEDE PEP EP PPS HA

Ousmane Sembene is con-
sidered the father of African
cinema. Born in Senegal on the
West Coast of Africa when the
country was still a French col-
ony, Sembene took up residence
in France when he fought in the
French armed forces. There,
after teaching himself to read
and write French, Sembene
began to write novels. In 1960,
when he was nearly forty, he
turned to filmmaking, studied
in Russia, and then returned to
Africa.

Xala (pronounced ‘‘ha-la’’) is
Sembene’s fourth feature film.
It was censored in his own coun-

try because it forsook the stand-
ard targets of satire constituted
by European exploitation and
racism to concentrate instead
on black African society. The
complete and uncut version
which we will screen satirizes
supposed African independence
from white colonial policies and
technology.

Filmed, the credits say, with
“the participation of the beg-
gars of Dakar, Xala shows
Senegalese life to be an uneasy
mixture of tribal superstitions
and white status symbols. A
white Mercedes, mineral water,
air-conditioning, and Coca Cola
figure prominently in this
movie by a director one critic
has called the African Moliere.
The hero is a half-Westernized
black businessman, just elected
the newly all-African
Chamber of Commerce and
about to marry a third wife,
who finds himself on his wed-
ding night suddenly struck
down by the ‘‘xala,” the curse
of impotence.

ment on theirelives become in-
extricably intertwined.

As the film develops its main
theme comes to center on the
fascination and, finally,
obsessive love that Charles
comes to feel for the mysterious
and tragic Sarah; and on the
similar obsession that Mike
develops for his co-star, Anna
—and, through her, for the fic-
tional Sarah.

This love ends for both
Charles and Mike, in pain and
betrayal, but towards the end of
the film these concerns, so
strongly developed by Reisz
during the course of the film,
cease to be of primary impor-
tance. Instead, the motivations
behind Sarah’s—Anna’s
behavior take center stage, and
both characters emerge as
symbolic manifestations of the
right of woman to assert her
individuality — to seek her own
space, as the nauseating
Californiaism goes — regard-
less of the age or society in
which she lives; and here the
film loses its subtlety and sen-
sitivity.

It is entirely possible that

 

Reisz could have made this
statement while keeping true to
the much more poignant and
timeless elements of the rest of
the film. He has chosen, how-
ever, not to do so, and what we
have by the film’s conclusion is
an unsatisfying assertion of
women’s rights throughout the
ages.

Yet for those who love precise
and beautifully — realized
historical film-making, The
French Lieutenant’s Woman is
much worth seeing — as an
evocation of Victorian England
it is masterly. The rich green
lushness of the English coun-
tryside; the solemn granite ma-
jesty of the coasts; the despair-
ful urban squalor of 19th cen-
tury London, and the deep red
velvet interiors of the clubs and
homes which sought to shut it
out — these images are brought
to the screen with stunningly
rich photography and superb at-
tention to detail. The French
Lieutenant’s Woman presents a
feast for the eyes, but, after
some intriguing progress, an
unfortunate scarcity of fare for
the mind.

in Division III, but the W&L ex-
ploited it by defense. No, that’s
not a typo, defense. According
to Canfield, the Generals tired
the Fords with defensive
pressure, which made Haver-
ford less effective at the other
end of the floor. ‘‘It was our best
defensive effort of the season,”’
he said. ‘‘We were able to play
our three offensive sets with
much more effectiveness.”

Canfield rotated his five
guards effectively so that he
always had a fresh set. Spears
led the guards with 13 points,
and Billy Yates had 9, Jaffe 8,
Henry Bond 6 and Chris
Baldwin 2. “‘Our depth is devel-
oping. There is a certain har-
mony with each guy knowing
his role and fulfilling it,’’ said
Canfield.

Graves led the Generals with
26 points and Hanson pulled
down 12 rebounds. Both players
were named to the all-tour-
nament team.

Not a lot of practice time is
spent on shooting free throws,
said Canfield. He says their
outstanding percentage in that
area ‘‘is a credit to the kids and
their concentration.”

The Generals also received a
boost when sophomore guard
Henry Bond was allowed to
return to school after an error
was discovered in his trans-
cript. He was used sparingly
against Bethany but scored six
points against Haverford and
provided a sparkplug in the H-

any, may arise from situating
Fancy Dress in the gymnasium,
Associate Athletic Director
Dick Miller stated that he did
not ‘foresee any problems.”’
Miller added that there may be
‘some inconvenience in
rescheduling classes’’ but,
other than that, had ‘re objec-

Works

Mr. and Mrs. Joseph C. Hor-
rell of Lexington have given an
important collection of 18th and
19th century English literature
to the Washington and Lee
University Library. The 178-
volume collection includes a
series of early biographies of
Jonathan Swift and a valuable
first edition of Swift’s
‘‘Gulliver’s Travels.”

“The Horrell Collection is
particularly significant because
it does put together a number of
18th Century biographies of
Swift and works about his
associates, including Alexander
Pope,’’ explained Richard W.
Oram, reference and public ser-
vices librarian for the Universi-
ty Library. Horrell collected the
books while he was pursuing his
B.A. and M-Litt. degrees at
Cambridge University. His
special field of interest was
Swift, whose poems he edited
for the Muses’ Library in 1958.

Mr. and Mrs. Horrell moved
to Lexington in 1976. They had
previously lived in Maryland
where Horrell was employed by
Vitro Laboratories while Mrs.
Horrell taught English for eight
years at the University of

 

 

 

Maryland.

According to Miller, ‘‘a
several thousand dollar mat”
intended to cover the gym’s
floor was specially purchased
by thé University in order to in-
sure protection for the dance
floor. Dean Lewis John, who
was involved in the decision to
buy the floor apparatus, justi-
fied the amount apportioned for
the mat, stating that the mat
will be used for other large
future gatherings held in the
sym.

Although some may protest
that tradition has been broken
in relocating Fancy Dress from
the Student Center to the
Warner Gymnasium, the SAB
asserts that those who attend
can expect the same quality
decorations. as have been
displayed in the past. The entire
two upper levels of the gym-
nasium shall be transformed,
giving the appearance that one
is not actually in an athletic
facility. In addition, profes-

sionals have been hired to con-
tend with various lighting
technicalities and several types
of imported beer will be on tap.

Entertainment in the new
gym will include, appropriate-
ly, ‘‘W&L’s most popular swing
band,’’ Lester Lanin, who per-
formed at the 50th annual Fan-
cy Dress Ball. Appearing in the
auxilary gym will be a top-
named band to be announced at
a later date. Several other
premium bands will be station-
ed in the fifth level projection
rooms. Commented U.C. chair-
man Bob Schmidt on the 75th
anniversary of Fancy Dress,
‘we want it to stick in people’s
minds as an_ extraordinary
event.”

Extremely tight security will
be enforced at all times
throughout the evening. The
doors open at 7:30 p.m. on Fri-
day, March 5 to inaugurate the
ball, and the bands will begin
playing at8p.m.

With Funds Unfrozen,
Outing Club Makes Plans

Not only are the W&L Outing
Club’s funds no longer frozen,
but the club is attempting to put
together a winter schedule. This
winter, the Outing Club is spon-
soring weekly trips to Winter-
green ski resort on the last
three Thursdays of January and
the first Thursday in February,
but one trip in February is be-
ing arranged with the Student

Activities Board and is current-
ly planned to end with an April

ski party at the resort.

On Sun., Jan. 17, the Outing
Club will have a caving trip
with Sweetbriar. All year long,

Gallup

(continued from page 1 )

Survey respondents feel that
state governments are more ef-
ficient, more understanding of
the people’s needs and more
likely to make decisions free of
political corruption, Gallup
said. This is an almost complete
reversal since 1936, when 56
percent favored concentration
of power in the federal govern-
ment. According to Gallup, 64
percent now prefer the state
governments.

Another trend Gallup noted
was the rise of support among
Americans for a third party.

Polls show that a hypothetical
center party would be sup-
ported by more registered
voters than the Republican par-
ty and almost as many as the
Democratic party. Gallup cited
“three specific social trends
which call for urgent remedial
action,’ voter apathy, drug
abuse and youth unemploy-
ment.

While a “‘sizable majority”’ of
those surveyed express dis-
satisfaction with the nation, 27
percent said they were satisfied
with the ‘‘way things are going
in the country.”’ Only 17 percent

Henry Baey reported that the
International Club was sponsor-
ing a “Spain Today” program
on Jan. 13. Dr. Laurent Boetsch
will give a lecture on that topic.

‘The purpose of the club is to
help foreign exchange students
adjust to life at Washington and
Lee,”’ Baey said. ‘The club also
wants to bring new cultural
ideas to the school.”’

The club is sponsoring a trip
to Richmond sometime in
January. Baey asked if,the E.C.
would be willing to cover
transportation and gas ex-

penses. This question presented
the only real discussion of the
meeting.

clubs to share gas expenses in-
stead of taking money out of the
student body funds.”’

Morgan Griffith, senior law
rep., was under the impression
that the E.C. could only advise,

 

said ‘‘it is always desirable for -

but not dictate, how a club could
spend their money. Ken Lang,
’82 rep., expressed concern that
other clubs will come before the
E.C. requesting money for
transportation.

Myers added “Next year,
there will be more budget re-
quests for transportation.”

There is no need to worry
about that, stated Ben Hale, ’84
rep. “The E.C. can always cut
the transportation requests.”

Hale said, “It’s the clubs’
responsibility to manage their
funds.’’ He then moved that the
International Club be allowed to
use its funds as it sees fit.

The motion passed 10-1. Lang
opposed the motion.

Mike Gregory reported that
the Outing Club has four ski
trips planned for the month.
The first one is scheduled for
Jan. 14 at Wintergreen. The
club will also be going caving
Jan. 17 with Sweetbriar College.
Gregory added that once a per-
son signs up for a ski trip, he is
committed to pay for it.

Dave Hepler, captain of the
Fencing team, reported that the
first meet will be with Navy on
Jan. 16. The club’s only expense
was the purchase of a scoring
machine.

Coulling To Speak At ODK

Dr. Sidney M.B. Coulling,
professor of English at
Washington and Lee Universi-
ty, will be the speaker for the
university’s traditional
Founders’ Day convocation on
Tuesday, Jan. 19. The public is

’ invited to attend the convoca-

tion which will be held at 12:30
p.m. in W&L’s Evans Hall. The
title of Coulling’s speech is

expressed this view at the
beginning of 1981, said Gallup.
‘‘Although only about three in 10
Americans expressed satisfac-
tion with the way things are go-
ing in the nation,”’ said Gallup,
“as many as eight in 10 of all
adults interviewed said they
were Satisfied with the way
things are going in their per-
sonal lives.”’

Gallup called for greater
religious instruction of
teenagers as well as increased
awareness concerning alcohol
and drugs. Questioned as to
whether frequently published

tion.”

University President Robert
E.R. Huntley will also offer
remarks during the program,
which will include induction
ceremonies for Omicron Delta
Kappa, the national honor
society recognizing outstanding
leadership.

polls have distorted the political
process, especially elections,
Gallup said that he ‘found no
tendency (for voters) to jump
on the wagon of the winning
candidate.”

_ Observing that the “horse-
race-type polls’’ showing can-
didates’ standings as during the
campaign have ‘‘no redeeming
social value,’’ he denied that
they influenced informed
voters. “I don’t think people are
that gullible to follow a can-
didate just because the rest of
the people are following him,”
said Gallup.
