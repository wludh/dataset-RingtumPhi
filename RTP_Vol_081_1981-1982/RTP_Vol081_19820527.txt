EC Winds Up Year

With Budget Talks

Rick Swagler

The Executive Committee
heard final reports from the
SAB, the Student Financial
Relations Committee (Cold
Check), the W&L Film Society,
th Rugby Club, the Ariel, and
Focus.

As expected, Randall Jacoby
reported that the SAB was
“once again in the hole.’’ The
estimated loss for this quarter
is around $2,000. Jacoby also
reported that the receipts from
the Michael Guthrie Band, ap-
proximately $500, had not been
deposited and were missing.
The E.C. questioned the prac-
tice of holding receipts, and
Bobby Schmidt explained that
they were used to pay the band
the following week.

Schmidt also noted that the
popular ‘‘Tuesdays in the
Cockpit’’ productions will
return next fall. Already booked
for September and half of Oc-

Rush: More Practical Professors Looking

Than Deferring Things |

by John Cleghorn

Mason Ellerbe, President. of
the IFC, and Dean Dan Murphy,
Assistant Dean of Students and
member of the Student Affairs
Committee; explained the fine
details of the new Rush calen-
dar at an open Rush forum
Thursday. The carefully design-
ed twenty-two day Rush they
presented is a better system
than those in the past as it re-
tains the crucially balanced
timing of contact, open houses
and. Rush dates while smoothly
compacting the calendar into a
tighter Rush that bows to
academic pursuits sooner.

Many alternatives have been

aired in the past months, the |

loudest of which was the issue of
a deferred rush. Although the
adopted system only shortens
rush four days, a difference
some might think inconsequen-

tial, the strength of the system

 

Commentary

lies in the day-to-day schedule |
of the calendar. The new Rush |
program is a far more practical |

answer than a deferred rush.
One of the most important
aspects of the new calendar is
an extensive orientation period

As the year winds down, so do
the professorships of at least
five Washington and Lee facul-
ty members.

Isabel Mcllvain, recipient of
a Ring-tum Phi award, will be
one of the two professors leav-
ing the art department. William
Rasmussen will be returning to
the Virginia Museum, where he
served until taking a one-year
leave of absence to teach at
W&L.

Professof Carren O. Kaston
will be leaving the English
department to return to her
home state of New York. She

‘has served as faculty adviser to

the Film Society during her
time at W&L.

Two other professors who are
retiring after a combined total
of 73 years at W&L will be
honored at the undergraduate
commencement exercises next
Thursday. They are Professors
Charles W. Williams of the
rfiath department and Charles
W. Turner of the history depart-
ment.

Williams received his
bachelor’s degree from Har-
vard, his master’s from the
University of Maryland, and his
Ph.D. from the University of
Virginia. He taught at W&L
from 1937-1939 and from 1948 to
the present. He has had several
articles published and has been
a visiting summer professor at

 

Development Office Takes A Break After A Ten-Year Wait

by John Cleghorn
in the
| Washington and Lee Develop-
| ment office is one of a long
awaited relaxation, about ten
| years awaited.

With the development drive
celebration over, so is the final

‘stage of a funding drive that
was initiated in 1972. After
finishing the decade-long push
and ending five million over the

‘projected goal, the develop-
ment office has a moment to
breathe.

“I didn’t feel that the develop-
ment plan was over until after
this weekend,’ said Richard
Sessoms, Assistant Director of
Development for W&L. ‘We
were hoping for our supporters
to leave after this weekend with
qa real good feeling about their

support for the school,’ con-
tinued Sessoms, ‘‘I think they
left with a good taste in their
mouths.”’

Those supporters of which
Sessoms speaks of are specif-
ically those individuals, founda-
tions, and corporations most
responsible for the successful
completion of the 1972-1981
Development project, namely
those who have given $10,000 or
more. The agenda for the
weekend celebration started
with a ceremony Friday after-
noon featuring addresses by
U.S. Supreme Court Justice,
Lewis Powell; Rector of the
Roard of Trustees, James M

Ballengee; and Universty
President, Robert E.R.
Huntley.

After a short reception at the

Lee house at seven, the benefac-
tors dariced and dined in the
Warner Center to the sound of
Jack Diamond and Friends
admidst a recreation of the 1982
Fancy Dress ballroom.

Saturday, the group was
taken on tour of the recently
completed buildings on campus
that were made possible by
their donations to the Develo-
ment Project including the
library, the law school, and
Tucker and Newcomb halls.

The School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics was
dedicated later that afternoon
marked by a speech by former
Norfolk and Western Railway
President John P. Fishwick.
Fishwick said of the school that
“It is built on the foundation
that it recognizes that beyond

U.Va. and VMI.

the training and the jargon of
any particular business or pro-
fession, there is an underlying
requirement that men _ be
educated to be civilized peo-
ple...people who have explored
the liberal arts and who realize
that men everywhere seek to
know what it means to be
human.”

The celebration weekend
coincided with the meeting of
the University’s Board of
Trustees. In addition to 22 of the
24 members of the Board and
335 benefactors, 6 of 12 Trustees
Emeritus invited also attended
the celebration.

“It has been the Board that
has provided extraordinary

support and leadership
throughout the decade-long
fund drive,’’ commented

tober are Bryce Street, Bruce

iv. el

Olson and the Offenders, Skip.

Castro, the Bill Blue Band, and
Virginia Fire.

Jacoby also made the Student
Financial Relations Committee
Report. Jacoby commented,
“People are bouncing checks
like crazy.’’ The committee is
considering a change in the pro-
cedure for picking up checks
from merchants so_ that
students will be able to cash
checks up until the end of the
year.

The Ring-tum Phi Business
Manager, Trent Dickerson,
reported that the Phi could have
an $1,800 surplus if all
receivables are collected. He
noted that the Army owes the
paper $150, and the Navy owes
between $200 and $300.

Russell Clarke made the W&L
Film Society’s final report, say-
ing that they might have a
deficit of about $100.

Turner, another Phi award
recipient, received his
bachelor’s degree at the
University of Richmond, his
master’s at the University of
North Carolina, and his Ph.D.
at the University of Minnesota.
He has taught at W&L since
1946. He has published over 50
articles and 12 books, the most
famous being Chessie’s Road.
During his tenure at W&L, he
has introduced new courses to
the history department concer-
ning Far East Asia and the
American West. This year he
has received the William Webb
Pusey III Award for outstan-

’ ding service and dedication to

Washington & Lee, and has had

1981-82: A Year Of Gains And Losses

It was a year of highs and
lows. Washington and Lee made
some impressive gains during
the 1981-82 academic year, but
also suffered a few ir-
replaceable losses. Here is a
month-by-month rundown of
what happened around campus
during the past year.

September

Though a_ short month,
September had a few instances
of controversy. To begin with,
the commonwealth legislature
decided to raise the legal drink-
ing age from 18 to 19, much to
students’ dismay (this was ac-
tually done over the summer).
To add to the misery, local law
enforcement agencies promised
to crack down on people caught
drinking illegally or in public.
People under the age of 21
caught consuming alcohol were
threatened with a first-class
misdemeanor charge. Anyway,
the threat panned out to be
nothing and people continued to
drink their merry way into obli-
vion. On the political front, the
Executive Committee was
sworn in with President Eric
Myers forgoing the usual in-
augural address and getting
right. down to business. The
business-like attitude of Myers
would become more evident in
the upcoming weeks as he cam-
‘paigned for constitutional
amendments. Also prevalent
during the first month was the
beginning of debate over the
current rush format for frater-
nities (the first six weeks of the
fall term). This proved to be a
debate that would carry on
through the final weeks of the
school year

October
October began with a
marathon budget hearing in the
E.C. room, the unpopular
choice of fiddler Vassar
lements as the featured per-
ormer at Homecoming, and
‘merchants worried about
thefts. The E.C. heard subcom-
mittee budget reports for a
perfectly dreadful eight hours
one Monday night. Meanwhile,
the Student Activities Board
alienated would-be beach and
soul lovers with the choice of

the earthy Clements. The E.C.

continued to dominate the news,

this time denying a request by
the Intervarsity Christian

Fellowship for a $400 piece of

the student budget. While the

I.V. controversy flared, the In-

terfraternity Council and its

president, Hall Vetterlein, of-
fered a compromise with the

Lexington Police Department

over the enforcement of noise

violations. In return for exten-
ding the amplified music

deadline from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.,

the I.F.C. promised that it

would enforce a stricter policy
of keeping houses litter-free. As
.of May, the compromise was
still being discussed. Perhaps
one of the problems was the

“mysterious” crash of a police

squad car in the War Memorial

gates in front of Ked Square.
While Lt. Torben Pedersen was
trying to tame a Sigma Nu
(more on them later) party, his
car rolled into the gates. When
he asked who ‘moved the car,
Pedersen was told it was done
by ‘‘A guy in khaki pants and a
button-down shirt.’”’ The parties
continued a week later at
Homecoming, where Katie Orr
of Hollins College was named
the queen. Controversy soon
switched from the E.C. over to:
the Ring-tum Phi, where
readers complained of the
papers prophylactic advert-
siements. Controversy then
switched back to Red Square
and the SNu house. SNu seemed
doomed to fall because of poor
financial management and cold
relations with the hill. SNu’s na-
tional chapter then stepped in to
save the day, as it were, with a
plan to raise $50,000 for the
house. As we will find out later,
SNu had a few more adventures
ahead of it. The month did end,
however, with the question of
who would fund Contact, the
school’s speaker symposium.
The I.F.C. eventually approved
an increase in funding for the
organization, which soon came
forward with a list a rather
mediocre speakers. One more
note: a Lexington police officer
was suspended in this month for
a 1977 theft at Hop-In...
November

As fall turned to winter, the
Phi became entangled in ques-
tions of aesthetics. The drama
department reacted nastily to
an editorial criticizing the
advertising of one of its plays. |

Un the more humorous side, tne
police car crash inquiry was
still at an impasse, with the
L.P.D. still after the student it
believed rolled the car into the
gates. And down in Red Square,
SNu suffered a_mystery of its
own when the house caught on
fire early one Saturday morn-

ing. The basement and the se- -

cond floor of the house were
damaged. By the middle of the
month, the Student Affairs
Committee had withdrawn
recognition of the W&L chapter
of the fraternity. The national
chapter (also located in Lex-
ington) at first indicated it
would assume the SNu debts,
but the ball was set in motion
for an abandonment of the W&L
chapter. Meanwhile; Contact
revealed its speaker line-up,
which featured the famous (F.
Lee Bailey) and the obscure
(Stewart Udall, Arthur Miller
(the lawyer, of course)). And
about this time, a national
magazine (Time) ran an article
on all-male colleges in the
United States. W&L was of
course mentioned, but in a way
that made the Lexington minks
appear hostile toward liberated
females and coeducation. The
article dredged up the issue of
coeducation — something that
had been dormant for some
time.
December

In another short month,
students were subjected to a
good bit of activity. Focus, nee
the Intellectual Symposium
(God knows what it was called
before that), came before the
E.C. with a plan to publish a 12-

 

page paper in the winter term.

Besides being merciful enough -

to rid us of the dreadful appela-
tion ‘Intellectual Symposium,”’
Focus provided a means of
creative thought for the campus
— something also promised by
the W&L Political Review. Both
organizations did appear during
the winter term, by the way.
Controversy continued over the
Time story, with one of the
students cited in the story say-
ing he was misquoted (Ed
Johnson, where are you?) and
another reader complaining
that the Phi’s editorial on the
topic was ‘‘spineless.’’ Hell hath
no fury like a wgman scorned or
a W&L man embarrassed. Also
in the month, an alumnus of the
Class of 1915, John Boatwright,
donated a cool $250,000 to the
university. The next month,
President Robert E.R. Huntley
would annouce that the school
had raised an extremely-cool
$67 million. Students soon settl-
ed in for the final weeks of the
term — worrying about exams
and growing restless for the
two-week break.
January

The winter term seems to =

bring out both the strange and
the macabre in Lexington.
Students looking forward to the
new term were shocked to hear
of the suicide of biology pro-
fessor Gary H. Dobbbs.
Students mourned the loss of a
man who seemed to epitomize
the successful professional. On
a wintry Thursday afternoon,
students gathered on the front
lawn of the Collonade to watch
President Huntley scatter

 

The Big Three, Hall Veueriein,
the SNU House.

Dobbs’ cremated remains.
Students could take some com-
fort to know that Fancy Dress
was on the way. The S.A.B. was
well aware of the fact, as it ap-
peared before the E.C. and
stated that the Diamond Jubilee
(75th anniversary of the ball’s
founding) would cost some-
where around $55,000. The 1981
ball had cost $38,000. The S.A.B.
also said it was working out a
plan with W&L Food Czar Jerry
Darrell for concert use of Evans
Dining Hall. The plan was in-
itiated with a reggae perfor-
mance. But January brought
more surprises. First, Betty
Miller announced she was retir-
ing from her post as secretary
of the dean of students. Then
came the worst storms of the
year. Snow banks and flu cases
piled up as students planned
ventures south in the upcoming
break. Despite the conditions,
organizations moved forward.
The S.A.B. continued its mam-
moth task of moving F.D. to the
gymnasium and the W&L
chapter of the Muscular
Dystrophy Association pre-
pared for its annual Super-
dance. Superdance ’82 ended up
being the most profitable one
ever, as Tripp Brower and his
crew netted somewhere in the
neighborhood of $24,000. Mean-
while, the I.F.C. began discus
sion of a delayed rush for next
year, with Dean of Fraternities
Dan Murphy asking a special
committee to examine the
feasibility of delaying rush for
an academic term. The E.C.
also departed from its ordinary
routine’ when Senior Law

‘ea

 

 
‘Representative Morgan Griffith
proposed that the committee
add two more members to its
11-man body. Discussion of this
matter was tabled for the next
month.

February
February opened with
perhaps the biggest story of the

year. President Huntley an-
nounced his resignation after 14
years at the helm of the univer-
sity. Saying that he had planned
to retire as far back as last fall,
Huntley made his announce-
ment a few weeks after he had
announced the completion of a
$67 million fund drive for the
university. Huntley’s resigna-
tion had been kept confidential
as far back as October. Super-
dance ’82 concluded with its
most successful haul ever and
the E.C. ended its talk of in-
creasing the committee’s
membership by. ‘“‘nuking’’ the
idea, to paraphrase a favorite
analogy of Eric Myers’.
February, if anything, was the:
month of Fancy Dress anxiety.
Students scrambled to get out
the F.D. “bid” and the S.A.B.
continued to promise the
greatest show ever. SNu popped
back into the news when a
general district court ruled that
that the SNu House Corporation
was liable for the local
chapter’s debts. The corpora-
tion seemed to think that it had
no responsibility for the action
of the W&L fraternity. The
university and chapter
members begged to differ,
however. SNu also claimed that
it had lost its financial records
in a Nov. 12 theft of the

treasurer’s apartment, thus
leaving the national organiza-
tion to handle the house’s $8500
worth of debts. Students were
given a break of sorts with the
Washington Holiday. Many
minks apparently opted for the

‘warmer climates of the south,

as indicated by the large ratio
of sun-tanned faces. Life also
became more complicated for
the S.A.B. when it was forced to
move the site of the Skip Castro
F.D. concert from the Warner
Center to Doremus Gym. Struc-
tural limitations were cited as
the main causes — thus raising
the possibility of a Brian
dePalma-like disaster had the
band played in the new gym.
F.D. was only a week away at
this time.
March

This is the month of the
university’s two staples— Fan-
cy Dress and lacrosse. The F.D.
jubilee was about everything it
was promised to be. Musical
entertainment varied from the
swing of Lester Lanin to the
funk of the Voltage Brothers to
the Rock of Skip Castro.
Decorations were nothing short
of stupendous, with each room
styled to commemorate a past
ball. The only problem was that
the bash ran the S.A.B. into a
financial sinkhole. Amidst the
F.D. hoopla was the release of a
New York. Times survey of
selected colleges. W&L was
given an ‘‘average”’ ranking for
academics, social life, and
quality of living. The survey
placed W&L on an academic
par with Sweet Briar and
Macon and left the university

miles behind U.Va. and U.N.C.
Political campaign rhetoric
also flared up when Bennett
Ross and Jim Averett vied for
the E.C. presidency.
Morgan Griffith ran unoppsed
for the vice-presidency and
Ross, running on a platform of
an E.C. that needs to be more in

tune with the student body, won:

the presidential election. Also
under the E.C. spectre was the
S.A.B., which spent the rest of
the month explaining its losses
at the ball. The losses were
calculated somewhere between
$15,000 and $20,000. Poor alumni
attendence was cited as one of
the factors for the loss. The
lacrosse team opened its
schedule with a thriller against

the Naval Academy and the .

promise of more to come with
matches slated against Virginia
and Carolina. And remember
that police suspension back in
October? By March, the affair
had mushroomed into the
suspension of more cops and the
allegations of a police theft ring
in Lexington. For students who
suspected the worst of the
L.P.D., it was the icing on the
cake. Meanwhile, things got
worse for the S.A.B. First, it
received a bad grilling from the
C. over the F.D. debts. Then a
rowdy crowd at a skin flick fore-
ed the eviction of the S.A.B.
from duPont auditorium and its
movie facilities. The S.A.B. was
out in the cold, literally. The
month did end on a positive note
for the S.A.B. when the E.C.
gave it the go-ahead for a Spr-
ing concert series that included

Nighthawks.
April

While half of April was
devoted to exams and Spring
break, the remaining part was
devoted to the casual at-
mosphere of the short term. The
lacrosse team had gone belly up
against Virginia, 22-8, but near-
ly beat the top-ranked Tar
Heels with an “Armadillo.”
W&L lost the game, 11-8, in a
match spoiled by hot tempers
and a post-game fight. Mean-
while, the I.F.C. was still kick-
ing around the delayed rush
question, this time raising the
topic at a Student Affairs Com-
mittee. A solution was promised
by the end of the month. From
Washington Hall came the word
that admissions applications
were at an all-time high
(perhaps a reflection of the con-
servative times). Seniors got
their first glimpse of the light at
the end of the tunnel at the
Senior Banquet. Rob Staugaitis
walked away. with the Gilliam
Award and Dr. Charles Turner,
a retiring history professory,
‘was the recipient of the Pusey
Award. As promised, the new
rush format was announced. To

the surprise of some, Rush was.

kept in the fall term and actual-
ly shortened by two weeks. The
earliest tearing opportunity
was pushed back two rush
dates, however, and newly-
elected I.F.C. President Mason
Ellerbe promised that fresh-
men would receive a more
thorough orientation. Critics
said the new format had the
same problems, but Ellerbe and

Dean Dan Murphy defended
their plan and asked for alter-
natives. Noticeably, there were
no takers to the challenge. The
E.C. slugged through its lame-
duck period by hearing subcom-
mittee reports. And quietly, the
Presidential Search Committee
was narrowing its list of can-
didates in preparation for next
month’s trustee meeting.
May

Thought by many to be the
most delightful month on cam-
pus, May offered unseasonably
warm temperatures and a
noticeable lack of precipitation.
Goshen and Twin Falls became
the new Meccas, the latter
becoming a bit too perilous
when its owner decided to en-
force his privacy rights. The
police theft ring culminated
with the indictment of 12 local
law enforcement agents.
Charges ranged from theft of a
pen to statutory burglary. While
the L.P.D. went through a
shakedown, the University
Council passed the new rush
format. And if students didn’t
have enough distractions, they
could have heard the speeches
of George Plimpton and Lloyd
Dobyns. The E.C. came to life
again, this time moving to com-
plete a Student Telephone
Union — one more way to avoid
the aggravation of CenTel. The
L.P.D. suffered another insult
when it wrote a letter of apology
to the Chi Psi fraternity for
wrongly shutting down a band.
Add to all this a flare-up bet-
ween the SPE’s and the FIJI’s
and you have a busy month.
Despite a 94 record, the
Generals were ranked only 13th
in the nation and missed the
playoffs again. And the admin-
stration adopted a plan
whereby a _ student could
theoretically graduate with a
better-than-4.0 g.p.a. The new
plus/minus system seemed to
have its own plusses and
minuses. In one last shindig, the
university celebrated its fund-
raising success by throwing an
extravagant affair for the top
donors. Included in the fun was
china imported specially from
D.C., red carpets and special
ceremonies and dedications.
The addition of new plaques on
academic halls gave one the im-
pression that W&L was becom-
ing the southern branch of
Cooperstown. Anyhow, the stu-
dent body rode out the remain-
ing part of the year.

In retrospect, 1981-82 was a
year of heights and depths. The
university continued to move
forward despite the occassional
setback. And despite the
pessimism of the times, the
school itself was in a rather op-
timistic position with a strong
endowment and increased ad-
missions. The past year has
seen trouble throughout the
world, but much of those ten-
sions have eluded Lexington. In
times of trouble, perhaps this is
the most comforting thought.

The Rugby Club reported that
it had a ‘‘disappointing”’
season, with an 0-4 record. The
club did better financially,
. however, finishing the year
with a $54.00 surplus.

Bill Archer made the final
report for Focus. He stated that
the spring Excelsior was
cancelled due to lack of
material, and said that he felt
that the committee should have
brought speakers to the cam-
pus. Long range goals for the
committee include a_ large
forum in 1986. In Archer’s
words, ‘Our final goal is 1986.”

Andrew Trotter reported that
the Ariel’s $545 surplus will be
put in the Publications Board

Rush

(continued from page 1)
for freshmen which is over
before the first contact is made.
In this three-day period,
Ellerbe vows that, with brutal
honesty, every event the
freshman will encounter during
Rush will be frankly explained
from the realitites of the black
ball system to the working of a
bid night. However the fresh-
man fairs, these unique happen-
ings will arise regardless, and,
it is far better for him to expect
Fe understand them, than to
ind out in the of Te
hand manner. me a oe
‘A second strength of the new
system is the placement of 2?
open contact dates before the
freshmen sign up for open
houses. These weekend days
will enable freshmen to visit
houses on their own and judge
for themselves, rather than

having to rate the fraternities.

for open houses on heresay,
hometown reputations, or mere
guesswork, as they have had to
do in the past. Again, this addi-
tion will save precious hours for
the rushee in his short period
for decision.

A third forte of the adopted
calendar is the movement of
two rush dates to a Wednesday
night. In past systems all rush
dates beyond 1&2, when bids
are given, and 3&4, when bids
are accepted, have only been
licenses to show the ‘“‘unimpor-
tant’’ rushees the boiler room.
The placement of these two ex-
tra weeknight Rush Dates will

It is obvious that the IFC, UC,

and weight for opportunity.
Contact or no contact, rush is, in
reality, an intense hourly pro-

poorly, drain the fraternity and
the rushee. Economy of time is
vital in planning a Rush calen-

President Huntley Speaks To
‘Privileged’ Law Graduates

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity awarded juris doctor
degrees to 107 law students dur-
ing commencement exercises
for the W&L School of Law
Saturday.

Robert E.R. Huntley, presi-
dent of Washington and Lee,
was the principal speaker for
the ceremony, which was held
on the front lawn of the campus.

Huntley told the law students
that they are “privileged per-
sons,’’ adding that ‘‘privileged
means you have a larger
measure of control over your
destinies than do most. You
have better opportunities than
most. You have better
understanding of the world
around you and what has gone

before than most.
“You are also, because of
your privileged status,

obligated persons,’”’ he con-
tinued. ‘Especially as lawyers,
your obligations and your op-
portunities for service to others
and to our American experi-
ment will be great.”

given the university a gift
valued at $1 million or more.
Although some might stop at
a figure such as $67 million, the
W&L Development Office has
not missed a step since the pro-
jects completion in January.
While Assistant Director
Sessoms has been executing the
final steps of the project
celebration, which has been no
simple task, Director of
Development Farris Hotchkiss
has not been sufficiently
satisfied. Hotchkiss has been
successful in raising an addi-
tional 2.1 million since the final
date of the project in January.
“We felt we wanted to make it
perfectly clear that as
marvelous as the $67 million
was, a University like ours con-
tinues to have needs,’’ com-
mented Hotchkiss, ‘“‘We’re very
happy that alumni and friends
have given us early support in
the post-project phase.” >
Sessoms continued, ‘‘the
future of an institution should
be to try to increase its level of
excellence. The brick and mor-
tar work is done,’’ said
Sessoms, “now we must con-
tinue to press forward.”

kiss. ‘‘We only charge 60 per-
cent of what it costs us to run
the school in the tuition. Forty
percent must come from some-
where else. Namely, gifts.”

So what lies in the immediate
future for a Development Office
after ten years of directed ef-

forts and $67 million? ‘‘We will

now begin to work on individual
needs,’’ says Hotchkiss.

This means priority on stu-
dent financial aid.

“Presently we are not able to
meet the needs of all the
students qualified for financial
aid,” Hotchkiss remarked. The
director of development cited a
figure that 33 students who were
qualified for financial aid in the
class of 1986 were not able to
receive the assistance they re-
quired. Initially the develop-
ment office’s goal was to offer
financial assistance to ll
students qualified but, says
Hotchkiss, that ceased to be a
reality three years ago. Cur-
rently approximately $1 million
in aid goes to 26 percent of the
student body.

All of the funding for student
aid at Washington and Lee
comes from gifts to the Univer-
sity. W&L is somewhat unique
in that aspect as many other

Lee maintains a_ separate
budget for financial aid.

A substantial amount of this
budget will come from a $12
million estate donated to the
University by Stewart Pratt.
Pratt specified in his will that
the money from his estate be us-
ed only for financial aid and to
support faculty salaries.

“Even with that,’’ remarked
Hotchkiss, ‘‘we are still falling
behind.”

That is the reason for the new
emphasis on financial aid.

Asecond new direction for the
Development Office is in the
direction of increasing the
number of endowed professor-
ships in both the undergraduate
and law schools. With the addi-
tion of two recent professor-
ships, one-in the law school in
honor of President Huntley, the
total comes to seven endowea
positions.

While W&L men find con-
fidence in the phrase ‘“‘non in
cautus futuri’’ the university
itself can look ahead without
hesitation, stepping firmly on
the growing foundation provid-
ed by the guidance of the
development office and the
generosity of its alumni.

Crop Walk Successful

by B. Scott Tilley

On Saturday, May 8, the Crop
Hunger Walk, sponsored by
Washington and Lee and the
Lexington Presbyterian
Church, raised $2,300.00 for
World Hunger. In addition,
$630.00 was collected from the
‘University World Hunger Day.

Eighty-six walkers turned out
for the walkathon — about half
students from W&L and the
girls’ schools, and half citizens
of the town. The weather pro-
vided sprinkles early in the
morning, but cleared up later
on during the 12-mile walk. Aid-
ed by water stops along the
way, all of the walkers com-
pleted the course, which took
about 3% hours. Young children
as well as older adults par-
ticipated.

Seventy-five percent of the
proceeds from the walkathon
will go to CROP, a world wide
organization, and 25 percent ta
RARA, a local organization.
Proceeds from World Hunger
Day, which were raised through‘
a donated dining hall
meal by Gerry Darrell an
donation cans throughout
campus, will be split betwee
CROP, RARA, and TAAP

W&L Adds Two

Professorships

Washington and Lee Univer-
sity has announced the
establishment of two endowed
professorships, including one
that will be named in honor of
‘W&L President Robert E.R.
Huntley.

In addition to the Robert E.R.
Huntley Professorship in Law,
Ballengee announced the
establishment of the Lillian and
Rupert Radford Professorship
in Mathematics.

The university said both posi-
tions are to be filled by the start
of the 1982-83 academic year.

The Huntley Professorship
was created to honor Huntley’s
presidency and his many con-
tributions to the university. In
establishing: the professorship,
the university’s board of
trustees designated
unrestricted endowment funds
which the university received
during the course of the
development program.

The Huntley Professorship
will be the first fully endowed
chair in the history of the
Washington and Lee School of
Law.

Huntley, who announced in
February that he will retire at
the end of 1982, previously
served as a professor of law and
as dean of the law school at
W&L before being named presi-
dent in 1968.

In announcing the creation of
the Huntley Professorship,
Ballengee said that the trustees
considered it ‘‘one small ex-
pression of appreciation for the
14 years of Mr. Huntley’s
presidency during which so
much has been accomplished in
so many important areas. The
board of trustees felt there
could be no more appropriate
honor for Bob Huntley.”

The Radford Professorship in
Mathematics has been created
as the result of a $750,000 gift
from the estate of Rupert Rad-

ford of Houston, Texas. Radford

owned and operated the |

University students, Scott Bond
of Wheeling, W.Va., and Steve
Corbeille of Haymarket, Va.,

will begin their postgraduate
studies following their gradua-
tion in June of 1983.

Bond, a German and history
major, plans to study German
diplomacy from 1948 to the pre-
sent. He will pursue his studies
at one of three schools in West
Germany.

Corbeille, a history major,
will use his Rotary Fellowship
to study in Australia, where he
will examine state-federal rela-

renovated and remodeled at a
cost of $3.5 million in 1979-80.

In his remarks, Fishwick
referred to Washington and
Lee’s long-standing commit-
ment to a liberal arts education.

“The main reason the (com-
merce) school has been worthy
of support is that it is not what
one might call simply a trade
school,’’ Fishwick said. ‘‘It is
built on the foundation that it
recognizes that beyond the
training and the jargon of any
particular business or profes-
sion, there is any underlying re-
quirement that men _ be
educated to be civilized peo-

the liberal arts and who realize

basis.

As part of the Rotary Founda-
tion program, both Bond and
Corbeille will make presenta-
tions at Rotary clubs in the
countries where they will be
studying.

Noting that about 25 percent
of the funds used to remodel the
Commerce School Building
came from American busines-

“‘business has to recognize that
no institution survives without
public support and acceptance.
It has to do more than just make
a profit in order to meet the
public’s criteria. But it also
must realize that if it goes too
far and infringes upon the
legitimate concerns of govern-
ment, it also runs into great
trouble.

” ue Ring-tum Phi, May 27, 1982

by G. Bruce Potter

If one had to sum up sports for 1981-82 here at General Lee’s col-
lege, the word ‘“‘almost’’ could be used. So could the word ‘“‘Ar-
madillo.’’ But that’s another story

The one theme that seemed to be prevalent throughout this year
with nearly every team, whether they were doing unexpectedly
well or just plodding along, would be that each came just short of
reaching its fullest potential.

Therefore, despite the good year for W&L sports (123-81-1 com-
bined record), that leaves room for improvement.

The usual skepticism once again greeted the football season back
in September, but once the leaves began to fall, the skeptics were
quickly put to rest.

Coach Gary Fallon’s squad gave a less-than-perfect performance
in the opening 20-7 loss to Gettysburg. Fallon used five different
quarterbacks before finally settling on Al Paradise, a sophomore
transfer from Harvard.

With Paradise under center, however, the Generals turned things
around quickly by winning their next two games, 24-17 over Emory
& Henry and 24-14 over Centre, before suffering a 13-10 setback at
Randolph-Macon. The team won its last six games to take the Old

Dominion Athletic Conference title and finish with an 8-2 record,
their best since the 1960’s.

Paradise threw for over 100 yeards a game, primarily to Mike
Fogarty, who hauled in 31 passes for 418 yards, despite appearing
in only seven contests, and Chris Cavalline. who caught 23 more.

Cavalline was also the Generals’ main threat over the ground.
The junior tailback rushed for 765 yards and seven touchdowns and
was named the best small college player i in the state of Virginia
and the O.D.A.C. player-of-the-year. "© ~*~

But, despite the outstanding record and the 0.D.A.C. champion-
ship, the W&L football season was missing one key ingredient — a
national championship bid. With one less loss, the squad almost
certainly would have joined the elite field of eight to compete for
the N.C.A.A. Division III title.

Meanwhile, the soccer team had hopes for a great season but,
after a good start, saw them go down with several key injuries and
numerous one-goal losses. The soccer Generals finished up their
season with a slightly disappointing 4-10-1 record for fourth place in
the O.D.A.C. There were some bright spots, however.

The Generals were ranked nationally for two weeks early in the
season and two players, sophomore Roiand Simon and junior Tad
Rener, were named to the all-O.D.A.C. team.

Under the direction of third-year coach Page Remillard,
however, the water polo team (more commonly known as
‘“‘mermen’’) had a truly amazing season, but they too fell just one
step short of the ultimate goal, the national playoffs.

The squad swept to a 31-5 record and the Southern League cham-
pionship (which includes such teams as Richmond, Virginia, and
Duke) and defeated several nationally-ranked teams.

But there was one team that gave the Generals troubles. It was,
of course, the Slippery Rock College of Pennsylvania. Washington
and Lee played Slippery Rock four times and lost four times.

And the last time came in the final round of the Eastern N.C.A.A.
water polo championships, thus relegating the Generals to a fifth-
place finish and knocking them out of any national championship
possibilities.

Junior transfer Eric Peterson and sophomore Rand McClain
were named to the all-American water polo team. Peterson set a
school record with 153 goals during the season.

A young Washington and Lee cross-country team placed fourth in
the O.D.A.C. meet, but rebounded to also finish fourth in the more
competitive N.C.A.A. Division III Regional Qualifying Meet in
Nashville, Tenn.

In that meet, W&L’s Angus McBryde placed eighth at 25:47.1 and
Frank Pittman was tenth with a time of 25:58.5. McBryde was also
the first Washington and Lee runner to receive all-conference
honors when he placed seventh in the 0.D.A.C. meet.

Certainly the one W&L team that came frustratingly close to the
N.C.A.A. playoffs was the basketball team. After compiling a 21-7
record and national ranking, they were apparently snubbed by the
N.C.A.A. selection committee and left out of the tourney.

The team got off to a slow start by losing its first three games, but
it was all uphill from there. Perhaps their biggest win of the season
was a 62-61 home decision over powerful Roanoke College. Senior
guard George Spears’ jumper with six seconds left provided the
winning margin.

After tying for the regular-season 0.D.A.C. title, the Generals
swept through the first two games of the conference tourney.
However, they fell to the feared Maroons by the count of 72-54 in the
championship game in Salem.

Sophomore John Lee Graves led the team in scoring (13.4), re-
bounding (7.4), and steals (34), edging out junior Brian Hanson in
‘those categories. Sophomore Billy. Yates hit on 56.7 of his shots
from the field and 86.2 percent from the foul line to pace the squad.

Another young team was the wrestling squad, with 11 freshmen.

And they got off to a slow start by losing six of their first eight
matches, but rebounded to win their final six contests and post a

  
The Ring-tum Phi, May 27, 1982, Page 7

fear Of The ‘Armadillo’

respectable 8-6 record.

Eight of the ten team members finished on the top four in their
weight classes. Sophomore Tim Valliere won the 158-pound class
and freshman Joe O’Neill captured first place in the 190-pound
class.

An 84 record is not shabby for such a young squad, and bigger
ro and better things are expected from them next year.

The Washington and Lee swimming team may not quite have met
the dominant theme of ‘‘almost.’’ The Generals had an excellent
season that was highlighted by a ninth-place finish in the N.C.A.A.
Swimming and Diving Championships held at W&L.

In that meet, senior Mike Bernot took second places in both the 50
and the 100-yeard freestyle events and the Generals’ 400-yard
freestyle relay team claimed fourth place. The squad posted a 6-5
regular season mark, but that can be chalked up to the schedule,
which included Richmond, William and Mary, V.M.I., and Virginia
Commonwealth University.

As the frozen,tundra of Lexington began to thaw, the active spr-
ing sports schedule got underway.

The golf team suffered yet another case of the ‘‘almosts’’ as to
}come within two strokes of winning the 0.D.A.C. title, but had to
settle for third place behind Roanoke and Lynchburg.

However, the Generals, paced by Titus Harris, Jim Kaplan and
Bill Alfano and coached by Buck Leslie, won all six of their duel
* matches to remain undefeated in that area over the past two years.

Meanwhile, another young Washington and Lee squad this year
was the tennis team with only one senior, Wes Yonge, in the star-
ting six.

Facing nearly all Division I and II competition, the team earned
.. a 6-17 regular season record and finished in third olace *~ *~
| 0.D.A.C. tournament held at W&L. In that meet, freshmen Andy
“Haring and Steven Bendheim each placed second in their single
flights and the doubles duo of Yonge and Jim Irwin also claimed the
runnerup position.

The baseball team got off to a very good start, but then became
mired in a slump about halfway through the season and never com-
@ | pletely rebounded, finishing the campaign with a 9-20 record.
However, they were in the O.D.A.C. playoff picture right down the
stretch, until a game between two other 0.D.A.C. foes was cancell-
ed, thus knocking the Generals out of post-season play.

Junior Chris Cavalline and senior Thad Ellis were named to the
second-team all-O.D.A.C. squad. Cavalline led the Generals in hit-
mee ting with a .340 average.

... On the mound, freshman Billy White paced the squad with a 3.09
ae earned run average in ten appearances. David Randall had an
ERA of 4.53 and a won-lost record of 3-3.

» Senior John McKee and sophomore Angus McBryde led the
© Washington and Lee track team to a 7-2 meet record and a third-
‘2 place finish in the O.D.A.C. championships held at W&L.

At that competition, McKee won the shot put event with a toss of
45 feet, 11-'4 inches. McBryde took the 1500-meter title with a time
of 4:02.48.

Once again, however, a case of the ‘‘almost” struck as the
; Generals placed third in the meet, only one point behind second-
«, place Bridgewater College, although well behind champion Lynch-
=e burg. 3
| And that leaves lacrosse.
| Which brings thoughts of close early-season contests, late-season

routs and, of course, the famed ‘‘Armadillo’’ slowdown offense us-
ed by the Generals in an 11-8 loss to the University of North
Carolina.

After an opening season 12-8 victory over Duke, the Generals
began their home campaign with a tough 11-10 overtime loss to
eventual N.C.A:A. playoff participant Navy. After crushing
Lafayette and easing by North Carolina State and Delaware, the
Generals once again were at home against Towson State.

Trailing late in the game, W&L rallied to tie the score and won,
(11-10), Hofstra (19-10), and U.M.B.C. (19-8).

A 15-10 triumph over William and Mary set the stage for THE
GAME with the University of Virginia. Except that it wasn’t much
of a game as the ’Hoos destroyed Washington and Lee by a final
count that required a calculator.

Not to be outdone, head coach Jack Emmer responded by install-
ing the “‘Armadillo’’ offense to avoid such a crushing from U.N.C.
the following Staurday. It worked well in that the Tar Heels could
not come up with a way to stop it, but W&L still went down in a close
defeat.

However, it was the 15-14 loss at Syracuse in the Carrierdome the
next week that all but eliminated the Generals from the playoff pic-
ture, despite impressive season-closing victories over Roanoke
(11-1), Hofstra (19-10). and U.M.B.C. (19-8).

And once again a W&L team had almost achieved a certain goal.
This time, that goal was the N.C.A.A. playoffs, but the selection
committee did not choose W&L to participate in that event.
However, with perhaps one or at the most two less losses (i.e. those
to Syracuse and Navy), this column might be about the Generals’
chances in the championship game.

Imagine the following situation...

A Hollywood actress, long renowned as beauty and sex symbol,
tragically dies before the completion of a movie she’s starring in
for M-G-M. She only had a few days of shooting left to go on the pro-
ject, and media speculation surrounds the fate of the film.

** Natalie Wood, 1981, right? Well, possibly. But a similar situation
presented itself nearly 45 years ago, and it is interesting to see how
the moguls of the film capitol dealt with each situation. It points to
an industry in which values seldom change.

In 1937, Jean Harlow was one of the hottest properties in the
business, having made a string of successful films for Metro since
signing an exclusive contract with them in 1931. Her credits includ-
ed the phenomenally popular ‘Red Dust’ (1932), ‘Dinner at
Eight’”’ (1933), “China Seas’ (1935) and a number of potent
moneymakers with Clark Gable, Wallace Beery, Spencer Tracy
and others.

During the spring of 1937 she was filming another story with
Gable, this called ‘‘Saratoga,’’ a racetrack romance featuring
Walter Pidgeon, Lionel Barrymore, Una Merkel and Hattie
McDaniel. The archtypical M-G-M production had about a week
left of Harlow scenes when the actress was suddenly taken ill. She

job and prints of the film were whisked to Loew’s Theatres across
the nation within’ weeks of Harlow’s death. “Saratoga” was a
definite hit, cashing in on a movie magazine-fed public dying of
curiosity. Apparently people amused themselves by trying to
distinguish between scenes with Harlow and the double, something
impossible not to do on the big screen.

Now it’s 1982, and M-G-M executives still haven’t decided what to
do about “Brainstorm,” a contemporary thriller that Natalie Wood
starred in with Cliff Robertson and Christopher Walken.

Its been months since Wood drowned off the coast of Catalina,
and given that the circumstances of her death were even more sen-
sationalized than Harlow’s, you can’t accuse the movie folks of
cashing in on the morbid curiosity of National Inquirer Readers.
They’ve hardly done a damn thing, and while you might say that
money isn’t their only objective in this case, there is an ingredient
quite different from Metro in the 1930s.

That is an insurance policy the studio signed with Lloyd’s of Lon-
don to the tune of 20 million dollars in case something happened to
“Brainstorm.” The film has been completed, with Wood’s two
scenes rewritten and shot to accomodate her absence. The ex-
ecutives now are waiting to see numerous special effects not includ-
ed in the film’s principle photography to determine whether to
release the project, or shelve it and collect on their policy.

 

‘Times may change, but profit motivation
does not, and the quality of most feature

films has taken a deep, deep plunge.”

died shortly thereafter, reportedly of uremic poisoning, and the na-
tion mourned the loss of the Blonde Bombshell.

Louis B. Mayer and other Metro executives speculated the fate of:
“Saratoga” before Harlow had even been put in the ground at
Forest Lawn. They knew they had a potential hit, drawing heavily
on the morbid curiosity of the public. But there was the problem of
several big scenes that required Harlow; they could not be written
to accomodate anyone else. So what to do?

Rewriting was done, and the brief scenes that included the
Harlow character were shot with a double. In these scenes she is
seen from the rear, usually wearing a hat, and with a few morsels
of dialogue spoken and dubbed by someone else. The scenes are
noticeably awkward, particularly in the clincher where Gable pro-
poses and the audience must settle for a close-up of his hand slipp-
ing the ring on the double’s finger and speaking his tag line in the
film (‘‘Honey, I love ya’’).

Overall, the film is pretty poor. Harlow is plump and dissipated-

zest and sassiness. This coupled with a shortened plot make it a
dissappointment, especially since it is a fine part for Gable. The
final scene is a cut from an earlier shot with Clark & Jean on a choo-
choo (with the print reversed so you know its going the other way)
singing a dreadful song called ‘“The Horse with the Dreamy Eyes.”’

Despite its obvious flaws, you can sit through the thing. M-G-M
probably didn’t even care about that — post-production was a rush

 

looking in most of her scenes and her lines are lacking incustomary —

Comparing the two situations you have: 1937, and a sure way to
make money is to nab a double and rush right ahead, regardless of
the outcome, release a truly mediocre film with an appropriate ad
campaign, sit back and watch the bucks roll in (Metro wasn’t the
highest-grossing studio from 1929-46 for nothing).

1982, and the economy is rough, movie business is down. Wood,
compared to Harlow, could be considered past her prime (‘‘Splen-
dor in the Grass”” was made when?), and the possibility of a ge-
nuine hit isn’t as great as a fat insurance payment, which would
mean a profit of a few million. At least they haven’t slapped
something together with a Natalie Wood ‘‘double’’ shot from
behind, but then people aren’t as dumb as they used to be, either,
and something like this would not escape the notice of the critics.

Money is still numero uno out there, which is why they’ve crank-
ed out really disgusting slaughter spectacles for a few years and
why the success of a lobotomized placebo like ‘“‘The Blue Lagoon”
is recycled into an even more inferior film called ‘‘Paradise.”’ In
the days of yore, a stinker was pushed cause they knew it’d make
money ; this is true now. But in the case of ‘‘Brainstorm,”’ by all ac-

counts a top-notch thriller, they’d rather hold it back in favor of
that sweet insurance.

Times may change, but profit motivation does not, and the quali-
ty of most feature films has taken a deep, deep plunge.

‘Ariel’
Combat

by R. Keith Hebert

As spring takes control 6ver
the seasonal cycle, many en-
joyable moments are added to
campus life. Only a handful of
students have missed their
chance to spend a day at
Goshen, and even fewer have
been excluded from the excite-
ment of a lacrosse game. Yet
one of these more relaxed
moments is reading the recent
edition of Ariel.

The Ariel offers a wide varie-
ty of artistic creativeness. The
writings are diverse as they
analyze an abundance of
themes ranging from a poem on
the hunting tactics of birds to a
short story on _ cruising
homosexuals. The magazine
also offers a collection of in-
novative photography that
should catch everyone’s eye.

A personal favorite is Mary
Dudley Allen’s ‘On Whether or
Not Birds Eat Dead Birds on the
Highway.’’ Allen demonstrates
her talent and imagination by
setting the reader in the mind of
a young bird, and through this
hunter’s consciousness she
poses questions about man and
his progress, Another poem,
“My Mother’s Red Lips”
displays Allen’s ability to
visualize ordinary happenings
in a complex fashion.

Joel Breckinredge’s ‘A
Measured Room’ also has
outstanding qualities. A young
girls’s reactions allow us to
reflect upon our childish at-
titudes from the not too distant
past. Breckinridge’s also incor-
porates Sara’s dreams and
emotions through the relation-
ship between Sara and her
grandmother. In a description
of Greta Garbo the author
cleverly states, ‘‘...Garbo’s face
was like a water mark on a
blank sheet of paper that let
Sara write in any emotion she
wanted.’”’ Joel should also be
noted for his bold contribution,
“Somber Reptiles.”

This Ariel contains a collec-
tion of literary excellence. Its
editors and contributing artists
should be congratulated and be
proud of their achievement.

Michael Caine Key

In ‘Deathtrap’

Deathtrap is a stylish screen
adaption of Ira Levin’s thriller
that still packs ’em in on Broad-
way after a comfortably long
run. It is good because it is
demanding of the audience’s at-
tention for all the right reasons.

Not entirely faithful to the
original, Deathtrap is full of
surprises and owes much of
what is right about it to the
director, Sidney Lumet, and
performances by Christopher
Reeve, Dyan Cannon and
Michael Caine.

It would be a crime to reveal

more than a wisp of the terribly
complicated plot, which con-
‘cerns the efforts of Caine. vlav-
ing a successful playwright on
the skids, to produce another hit
at any cost. He is desperate,
and since thrillers are his
specialty, it should come as no
surprise that murder fits in with
his plans of renewed success.
' Caine’s performance is the
centerpiece of Deathtrap. Mid-
dle age has softened his sharp
features and he actually looks
paunchy in some scenes. He has
subsequently said he _ pat-
terned his performance after
Sylvester the Cat, and he cer-
tainly sputters enough even
though he never exclaims “Suf-
ferin’ Succotash” or anything
like that. It is an uneven
nerformance, which could be
explained in terms of a wildly
fluctuating plot, but he ends up
coming across as silly as oppos-
ed to sinister, not unlike the
feline cartoon he says he sought
to emulate.’ This, I believe, is
supposed to fit in with the comic
aspects of the film, not all of
which come off terribly well.

Christopher Reeve is by far
the best in a great job of off-
casting. As an aspiring play-
wright with fewer scruples than
Caine, Reeve plays on his all-

American good-looks and the
image of politeness and civility
accrued through Superman to

pull off a truly riveting perfor-
mance. He is imminently more

watchable than Caine. The fact
that the two are homosexuals
might send some to the lobby,
but Reeve pulls it off successful-
ly by almost parodying the
Situation, and he speaks his
lines with more zest than
anyone else. He really makes
the movie.

Dyan Cannon got raves and
an Oscar nomination for her
performance in Heaven Can
Wait four years ago. She hasn’t
done much else since, and her
part here is that of another
screamer (which is funny in
about two scenes). The
character of her part is more
sympathetic, however, and she
comes off relatively unscathed.

Except for the opening scene
in a theatre and Manhattan bar,
most of the film is shot on a
huge set, as in the play, of
Caine’s home in the Hamptons,
a converted windmill. It’s a
great set, cleverly constructed,
not detracting from the goings-
on and never tiresome. After
the first half-hour it is irrele-
vant.

Lumet does a great job in
terms of pace, and the use of
camera is particularly effec-
tive. It must be said, however,
that the ending is a bummer
(and quite different from the
ending of the actual play). Irene
Worth does a pretty good turn
as a Swedish psychic living next

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

For Now, Adieu

Seeing as this is the last editorial of the year, I will
not prophesize on any topics. At this point in the year,
one doubts that students are concerned about
anything other than going home for the summer. In-
stead, I will say a few goodbyes and a few thank-yous.

 

 

 

First, thanks should go to all the people who helped
produce this year’s paper. Putting together a
newspaper on this level, especially with the pressures
of college, gives the Phi staff a uniqueness it should be
proud of. To Trent, John, Evans, Steve, and all the
rest, thanks. |

I have spent four years at this university and seen a
lot of people come and go. People are sometimes quite
vocal in their displeasure with this university, but I
really can’t think of a place where a student has such
opportunity. What I’m talking about is upward
mobility. In many organizations, a student can easily
move to the top of the ladder merely by doing his best.
This is not possible at a lot of other schools.

Before I leave, I would like to pass on my sincerest
wishes to my successor, Todd Smith. He will have the
opportunity next year to observe much of what hap-
pens on campus this year and help improve the quali-
ty of life at W&L. If he does as well as I suspect, the
Phi will be in good hands for another year.

P.S. Sorry about the Phi Awards, Carole. Maybe next
year.

Last Thursday night, the Interfraternity Council
made itself available for discussion of next year’s
rush schedule. The hour-long discussion was slick,
interesting, lively and unattended. Only 20 people
showed up for this event, which was advertised
around campus well before Thursday. Moreover,
the 20 people in the audience represented less than
half of the fraternities on campus.

What the rest of the student body missed was an
indication of what would happen next fall. The two
main spokesmen, IFC President Mason Ellerbe

and Dean of Fraternities Dan Murphy, defended
their plan while E.C. Representative John
Vlahoplus fielded questions and played devil’s ad-
vocate.

What Ellerbe and Dean Murphy defended was a
shorter rush — four weeks as opposed to the usual
six — and one which gives freshmen more of an
opportunity to look around before making any
decisions. The new system, according to Ellerbe,
offers the rushee a chance ‘‘to make an educated
decision.

Central to this plan is a three-day period of open
contact following rush orientation and registra-
tion. On Thursday, Sept. 9 (and all this is still sub-
ject to final modifications), registration and orien-
tation will be held. But from the beginning,
changes will be instituted.

The first such change will be a more thorough
orientation. Freshmen generally complain that
they are ill-prepared for rush — that they have no
idea of how to act at open houses, how to react to
not getting bids, etc. Orientation will deal more
thoroughly with this, Ellerbe argued. The IFC will
offer as many as six discussion groups at orienta-
tion to inform the freshmen of what to expect.

Following Thursday’s registration is three days
of open contact. This means weekend parties and,
hopefully, a chance for freshmen to meet the
houses on a more informal level. House-sponsored
parties will be held the next Wednesday (the 15th)
with the first rush dates beginning on Friday the
17th. Ellerbe said that he had considered begin-
ning the rush dates on the 15th, but opted for the
traditional Friday.

Rush dates 1.and 2 are on Friday, but rush dates
3 and 4 are on the following Wednesday. This was

the big surprise at the meeting. The IFC shortened
rush by placing half the dates on Wednesday

night.

The climax of rush is Friday the 24th when the
rushes can accept bids. This is actually a step
backward from last year, when rushees could tear
after only the fourth rush date. Rushees must wait
until after the sixth rush date before tearing this
time, however. Rush will officially end on the 30th,
with preference cards due. Within the period of
four weeks, the IFC believes it can educate
freshmen on the nature of rush, steer them to.the
houses, put them through eight rush dates and let
them make ‘‘an educated decision.’’ Whether this
will work is anyone’s guess.

Obviously we are operating without the benefit
of hindsight, but from watching Thursday night’s
presentation, it appears that the IFC is on the
right track to making a better rush. And here area
few reasons why:

1. The most important reason — the IFC
recognizes that there is a problem and has decided
to do something about it. Whether this new format
works is impossible to predict, but one has to be

|

impressed with the effort involved in solving the
problem. More thought has been given to the emo-
tional and social problems that freshmen have,
the pressures involved in making a decision withir

‘a few weeks, and the consequences of not getting a

bid. Efforts have been made in all these depart-

ments to help the rushers.

- 2. The IFC has not been one-sided in its
modifications. While the primary concern is for
the welfare of the freshmen, the IFC has also
made some improvements that should help the
houses. The most hoped for changes are the issu-
ing of noise ordinances. Ellerbe has formed a com-
mittee (headed by IFC vice-president Steve
Jones) to see if the amplified music curfew can be
moved back from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. Ellerbe also
has suggested a meeting between Lexington Chief
of Police James Kirby and fraternity presidents.
The eternal pessimist may label this as a pipe
dream, but again these are positive steps.

3. For once, the IFC appears ready for Rush.
Rush is something that is brought out of the closet
in late August and dusted off before the students
come back in September. Discussion and planning
for Rush this time occurred in April and May.
Careful administration, thoughtful planning, and
a more energetic IFC should alone improve next
year’s Rush.

But perhaps there is one final reason why rush
was limited to only four weeks. The panel simply
could not come up with a better alternative than
having rush in the first weeks of school. The ad-
ministration, as previously mentioned, favored
delaying rush until the beginning of the second
term. This would mean that most of the six-week
period between the beginning of the second term
and Washington’s holiday would be dominated by
Rush.

John Viahoplus had the final answer for not
delaying rush — money. If the fraternities could
survive fall term without freshmen dues, then
perhaps we would have a delayed Rush. Money
runs a university, it also runs a fraternity.

Delaying Rush for a few weeks was also
negated. Dean Murphy said that it would only in-
crease the anxiety of the freshmen. What it would
also do is push Rush into midterms — and cause
more friction on the hill. The best alternative,
then, was to hold rush in the first weeks of school.

It will be interesting to note how next fall’s
adventure turns out. In the past, much of the
responsibility for administering Rush has fallen
on the IFC and fraternity members. Next fall’s
system is a subtle change in-that it places more
responsibility on the freshmen. By giving rushees
more time to look around, fraternity members and
the IFC can take less blame for any confusion.

Unfortunatly, this may be asking too much of
the average 18-year-old freshman. Those
freshmen with associates from their high school
days in fraternities will probably do well in the
new system. They always have and they always
will. But those freshmen new to the W&L way of
life and without friends will again be on their own
to make the right decision.

It is said somewhere that college is the place to
begin making educated choices.

At W&L, the first of these decisions is made in
the first four weeks of school. One grows up fast at
W&L. .

Finishing Undefeated Season,
Golfers Snu

by B. Scott Tilley

Winning a tri-match against
Randolph-Macon College and
Bridgewater College, Coach
Buck Leslie’s golf team turned
in its second consecutive
undefeated season. As was the
case with basketball, the team
failed to receive an expected
NCAA Tournament bid, though.

Leslie noted that he was
“disappointed.” Usually a 77
stroke average is good enough
to get you in.” He noted that the
team finished second, third,
third, and second against Divi-
sion III opponents in the four
tournaments in which they com-
peted, and beat many other
Division I and II schools. He
also felt senior Titus Harris
should have been invited as an
individual, though he wasn’t.
“It’s our turn to get mad,” said

‘Partners’

and her relationship to the en-
ding is downright annoying.

Thrills, chills and excitement
abound. Deathtrap really keeps
you on the edge of your seat
without the benefit of blowsy
special effects or real out and
out violence (well, maybe just a
wee bit), In spite of its weak
ending it is highly recommend-
ed. >

Partners is another entry in
the latest spate of movies in-
volving the gay community,
and a pretty strange one at that.

Ryan O’Neal...well, let’s stop
a minute. What has he ever
done to afford him the distinc-
tion of being a great star? There
was Love Story, I suppose,
which relied more on the
schmaltz of the situation than
acting. What’s Up Doc? was a
good movie but he doesn’t
deserve any credit for that (he
came across as limp fish with
Streisand and Madeline Kahn).
And what else? Paper Moon,
but his daughter stole that right
away from him. Then there was
that all-star war epic A Bridge
Too Far, in which he was simp-
ly lost in the crowd; The Main
Event, no great shakes by
anyone’s standards, and then
two phenomenally bad flops,
Oliver’s Story and So Fine.
O’Neal appears to be strictly
celebrated for fathering Tatum

and screwing around with Far-
rah Fawcett.

Well, he doesn’t do himself
any good in this confused, poor-
ly made fiasco, either. The
“plot” concerns macho cop
O’Neal being paired with gay
bookkeeper John Hurt to set up
housekeeping in a gay neighbor-
hood to check into the murder of
a gay model. Most of the.
theoretical laughs are supposed
to come from O’Neal’s facial
expressions in reaction to
various situations. Certainly
they didn’t intend his haircut
and tight clothes for laughs, my
God, hasn’t he looked like that
in all his recent movies?

Hurt never registers as
anything but neuter on the sex-
ual scale. He is not overtly gay
except he likes to cook special
dishes for Ryan and do house-
work and all that. It is an empty
performance; Hurt’s face looks
blank most of the time. This
movie looks like it intended to
be a comedy-drama with em-
phasis on drama that shifted
midway to emphasis on comedy
which it falls far short on. Hurt
doesn’t act like he’s playing in a
comedy, his character is just
too sad and unfunny.

There are an abundance of
fag jokes and stereotypes which
tend to get old. Instead of focus-
ing on the relationship between
the two, which may have been

interesting (a couple of brief
moments indicate this may
have been possible), the dreary
story of searching for the killer
of gay models plods along in
such a manner as to make a
snack bar trip unavoidable.

There are numerous uncon-
vineing aspects to the movie,
notably the plush apartment the
“odd couple”’ live in. Do all gay
couples live in such luxury?
Also, Kenneth McMillan as the
police chief does it all wrong.
which can be blamed on the
dumb script, but its a shame
because he was excellent as the
slovenly firehouse chief in
Ragtime:

At the end (you’ll forgive me
for lessening the impact by
giving it away) it appears Hurt
has been mortally wound-
ed, and O’Neal delivers a trite
monologue over the body. It
sounds like it was written to be
spoken in a sobbing voice, but
Ryan rat-a-tat-tats right along,
and they take the body away
and later find out he’s alive, but
you never see him...it’s just
dumb; dumb, dumb, dumb.

I would say I hope O’Neal
finds a role suitable for his
talents, but perhaps he already
has. He’ll never be more than a
mediocre straight man, one of
those more famous for his off-
screen conquests than the quali-
ty of his work.
