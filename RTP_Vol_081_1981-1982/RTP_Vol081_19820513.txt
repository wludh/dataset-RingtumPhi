by Scott Mason
An incident involving

members of the Sigma Phi Ep-
silon and Phi Gamma Delta
fraternities early Saturday
evening escalated into damages
estimated at several hundred
dollars, criminal charges and
warrants for arrest.

Russell Rosler of Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Drew Clark of
neighboring Phi Gamma Delta
engaged in a hostile dispute
after Clark apparently
threatened to drive his 1970
LTD automobile onto the SPE
front yard.

At approximately 7:45 p.m.
Saturday night, following the
Producer’s concert on the upper
athletic field, Rosler said he
saw Clark moving his car from
the FIJI lawn. Clark said he had
parked the car there temporari-
ly and was on his way to move
the vehicle into the FIJI park-
ing lot.

At this time, an unidentified
FIJI member shouted to Clark
to drive the LTD through the
SPE yard. The two houses are
separated by an oak tree and
several bushes which serve as a
border between the two houses.

Upon hearing this and seeing
Clark maneuver his car
threateningly close to the SPE
yard, Rosler grabbed a Sprite
bottle, stood in front of Clark’s
automobile, raised his weapon
and warned him not to proceed
further.

Clark said he was merely tur-
ning the car around and had no
intention of driving onto the
SPE yard. Rosler said,
however, that Clark rolled
about two feet onto SPE proper-
ty and seemed to be threatening
to proceed further. Clark, on the
other hand, said he did not drive

 

Letter To Chi Psi Fraternity:

 

 

Police Apologize For Stopping Band

by John Cleghorn

What seemed to be a simple
noise warning incident at the
Chi Psi fraternity turned into an
embarassment for the Lex-
ington police force and a letter
of apology from police Chief
James Kirby.

On Sat., April 24, a band party
at Chi Psi was shut down by two
inexperienced Lexington of-
ficers who claimed that a com-
plaint had been filed against the
fraternity for loud noise
emanating from the band, The
Toys. Last week, Chi Psi presi-
dent Danny Einstein received a
letter from chief Kirby explain-

ing the error and offering an

‘ apology but offering no compen-
sation for the expense of closing
the band down early.

Officers Knick and
Thomasson, both temporary
replacements for the sus-
pended Lexington officers,
gave Einstein a warning at ap-
proximately 11:20 p.m. claim-
ing that if a complaint was
received, the party would be
immediately stopped.

Approximately one hour
later, after the officers had

, Observed the party from the

street for a short period of time,
Knick and Thomasson personal-

ly stopped the band.

“I knew something was rotten
from the start,’’ said Einstein,
who had taken special care to
keep the front door closed and
contain the noise within the
house. ‘“‘There’s just nobody
that we can bother around
here,’ commented the house
President.

After the band had been stop-
ped, Einstein specifically asked
the officers if there had been a
complaint filed. Upon their
acknowledgement, Einstein in-
quired the identity of the com-
plaining party which the squad

he believed it may have been
impossible to maneuver the
vehicle between the tree and
bushes.

With Rosler’s arm waving in

ning. Suddenly, Rosler’s arm
came down, smashing the bottle

REVIEW gud OUTLOOK Dobyns Addresses Education Needs

 

 

Editorial Opiric> of The Ring-tum Phi
Drop/Add

A letter on this page introduces a subject that has
not been discussed much on campus this year —
drop/add. The main controversy surrounding the
drop-add rule has been whether a student can make a
sound decision after only one week of the course. The
letter below claims that one week is not a suitable
period for making such a choice.

If one looks at the situation, a week is probably
enough time to make the drop-add decision. For one,
a student in theory has the wisdom of a faculty ad-
visor to fall back on. More likely, an industrious stu-
dent can confer with other people who have taken the
course — and then decide the course’s worth. On a
campus this size, plenty of input can be achieved
within the span of a week.

There is a problem with drop-add, however. Some
professors are very lax in their courses during the
first week of a term — the spring term being the most
noticeable one. Professors sometimes miss the first
week of classes — or hold only one or two sessions. In
‘this case, the student is at a disadvantage. Sometimes
the professor is not even physically available for con-
sultation. This too works against the student’s favor.

All things considered, however, the drop-add rule
seems sensible enough. The system does place
pressure on the student to make a sound decision by
the end of one week — but making responsible deci-
sions is part of the college experience. Philosophers
suggest that Rome was built in a day and the world
was created in six days. There is no reason, therefore,
that a student cannot drop-add within a week.

NBC News correspondent
Lloyd Dobyns told a
Washington and Lee University
audience Thursday night (May
6) that ‘the problems of
establishing a working educa-
tional system that meets to-

day’s and tomorrow’s needs .

are...horrendous.”’

A 1957 graduate of
Washington and Lee, Dobyns
was the keynote speaker for the
annual Alumni Reunion week-
end at the university. He was
participating in the 25th reunion
of his Washington and Lee
class.

Dobyns has won_ several

awards in recent years for his.

writing and reporting on
several NBC documentaries
dealing with economic issues.
In July he will become co-
anchor of a new NBC newscast

‘that will begin at 1:30 a.m. and

last one hour.

Citing the explosion that has
occurred in communications
and technology over the past 46
years, Dobyns suggested that 25
years from now there will be
“technological changes that no
one here this evening can im-
agine. If you can accept that,
then you must accept this: In
those 26 or fewer years, the
pressures on educational | in-
stitutions will become almost
unbearable.

“The need for trained man-
power will become the most im-
portant economic concern we
have. The need for continuing
education on several levels will
be compelling.”

Dobyns said that the changes
necessary for education to keep
pace will be made ‘only by
those who have been taught how

to learn, people who have been
educated well enough to know
that as things change, they are
no longer well educated.”

Dobyns rejected the argu-
ment made by some that educa-
tion should ‘‘become a junior
partner of industry” in the
future.

“To train someone only to
work does not train him to
learn,” said Dobyns. ‘‘And if he

cannot learn, how will he keep
up as demand changes?”

Dobyns said that. even a
perfect educational system
would not cause the economic
problems the country now faces
to goaway.

But he added that “if educa-
tion does not improve, then
nothing else we do will solve the
problem. Education is not the
solution, but there is no solution
without education.”

C-School Initiates"

Washington and Lee
University’s chapters of Beta
Gamma Sigma, the national
honor fraternity in business ad-
ministration, and Omicron
Delta Epsilon, the national
honor society in economics,
held their initiation ceremonies
on the campus Thursday (May

6). in

The Beta of Virginia Chapter
of Beta Gamma Sigma initiated
six undergraduates and one
faculty member while also
making an alumnus, Robert G.
Brown of Dallas, Texas, an
honorary initiate.

Brown, a 1949 graduate of
Washington and Lee, is chair-
man of the board and chief ex-
ecutive officer of University
Resources Corporation of
Dallas.

In 1979, Brown and his wife,
Judy Brown, established an en-
dowed professorship in the
School of Commerce,
Economics, and Politics at
W&L. He was the first W&L
alumnus to create an endowed
professorship by an outright

gift during his lifetime. The pro-
fessorship honors the 40-year
teaching career of Lewis K.
Johnson, professor emeritus of
administration at W&L.

Dr. Carl P. Kaiser, assistant
professor of economics, was the
faculty initiate of Beta Gamma
Sigma while the student in-

‘ itiates were seniors Graham T.

Burnette of Lexington, Andrew
F. Gottschalk of Lake Forest,
Ill., John E. Monroe of New
Orleans and juniors Timothy J.
Elfering of Lake Forest, IIl.;
Vincent J. Fechtel of Leesburg,
Fla., and F. William Gue of
Alexandria.

Omicron Delta Epsilon in-
itiated Dr. Bruce H. Herrick,
professor of economics, along
with seniors David R. Cordell of
Oklahoma City, Robert L.
Dalman of Greenwich, Conn.,
Clifford T. Gordon of St. Louis,
Md., Titus H. Harris of Houston,
David A. Nickels of Huntington,
N.Y., Daniel L. Weiss of Chevy
Chase, Md., and junior John C.

Student Irked At Faculty EC

Dear Sir: .

I am writing in regard to an
incident that I had with the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the facul-
ty. I feel that I have been
treated unjustly and would like
the student body to be aware of
it.

Monday (May 3), one day
after the drop/add period had
ended, I was denied the right to
drop a sociology course. After
having gone to classes for a
week, I made this decision
which would leave me with an
economics course. Yet, because
I was only one day late, I had to
go through the process of peti-
tioning the E.C. Two days later
I received a letter in the mail
from the Dean of the College de-
nying me the right to drop the
course on the grounds that my
reasons were not valid.

This left me with the alter-
native of continuing to take it
this spring or flunking it this
spring and taking it in the fall. I
chose the latter.

The E.C.’s basic reason for
not letting me drop this course
is that it cannot make an excep-
tion to a rule. This rule was
made because the E.C. feels

that one week is a sufficient
amount of time to drop or add a
course. If a person is thinking of
dropping a course he will
evidently not work as hard dur-
ing the drop/add period. In the
case that he decides to take the
course, that one week of not
working up to 100 percent of his
capacity could slightly hurt him

 

in the long run. This is true, but
it has no relevance to my situa-
tion. This also leads one to
believe that there is a major
flaw in the decisions of the Ex-
ecutive Committee. Having this
“F”’ on my report card will (1)
psychologically damage my
academic performance, (2)
hurt the fraternity house’s
grade point average and” (3)

destroy my own grade point
average. This is all because of
the inadequate ruling of the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

How can one flunk a course
without having taken it? It is
these reasons that leads me to
believe that the faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee has not ade-
quately reviewed my situation
and is generally afraid to make
an exception to a ludicrous rule
in such extreme circumstances.

My proposal is to do some
justice for the students at W&L
and petition the executive com-
mittee to make an amendment
to this rule. I propose that if a
student is definitely going to
drop a course but must resolve
to flunk it because the drop/add
period has ended, then the
grade and the course be om-
mitted from the report card.
This is not a very demanding
proposal considering that tak-
ing an “‘F’”’ in this situation is a
senseless reduction of a stu-
dent’s morale because of an un-
fair decision made by the facul-
ty Executive Committee.

Sincerely,
Rusty Hartley

‘8-1/2’ To Go At Lyric

by Carren O. Kaston

The Lyric Theatre in
downtown Lexington will show
Federico Fellini’s 8% (Italy,
1963: 135 minutes) in conjunc-
tion with Professor Carren
Kaston’s spring film course,
English 234. The special screen-
ing, which is made possible
through the generosity of the
theatre’s manager, Mr. Dale
Tomlin, will take place at the
Lyric on Tuesday, May 18, at 2
p.m. for a charge of $2 per per-
son. The public is cordially in-
vited to attend.

One of the masters of the
modern cinema, Fellini entered
filmmaking with a background
in both journalism and the
theatre, a double heritage of
which he was to make use in his
progression from Neorealism to
Surrealism. Fellini first worked
with the Neorealist director
Roberto Rossellini on Rome,
Open City (Italy, 1945) and
Paisa (Italy, 1946). Neorealism
was founded on a belief in the
documentary power of the
everyday surfaces of life to
reveal what was meaningful
and “real” about experience.
Fellini ultimately questioned
whether this =~. sense of

reality was adequate, whether
reality resided purely in sur-
faces and external appear-
ances, in the look of things. His
questions led him to emphasize
fantasy and dream: the reality
beneath the surfaces — Sur-
realism.

Aside from 814, which is con-
sidered his transitional film,
Fellini is perhaps best known
for La Strada (1954), La Dolce
Vita (1950), Juliet of the Spirits
(1965), Stayricon (1969), Roma
(1972), and Amarcord (1974). In
his work, the circus appears
Over and over again as an
emblem of magic and fantasy,
although it is also, for Fellini,
an element of fact since, at the
age of 10, he ran away from
home and joined the circus.

8% makes the New Wave
tenet that the director is the
“star of a film literally true on
two levels. First, Fellini picked
to represent him, the director,
one of the stars of the Italian
cinema, Marcello Mastroianni.
Second, the movie self-
consciously takes as its hero a
movie director. Guido, a direc-
tor who is suffering from

pop bands’ short songs with cat-
chy melodic hooks (‘‘Nobody

singing and songwriting effort
of Van Temple (vocals/guitar),
Kyle Henderson(vocals/bass),
Wayne Famous (keyboards/
vocals) and Bryan Holmes
(vocals/drums).

The tirst album edged its way
into the top 100 and the songs
“What She Does to Me” and
“What’s He Got’ received
airplay in the south. These two
songs also highlighted the first
set Saturday afternoon.

After the rain had cleared,
the lax team had won, and the
roadies had finished a lengthy
soundcheck, the Producers
showed that they were worth
the money. The band played
two nine song sets that were
tight and well executed. Songs
featured were from their first

(expected in the end of June),
and the cover song “A Hard

Kyle Henderson shared
singing chores with Van Tem-:
ple.

The first set was luke-warm,
but the second set increased in
pace and quality. In the second
set, the crowd was more ap-
preciative and active either due
to growing interest or their fifth

cluding ‘‘I Love Lucy,”’ ‘‘Life of
Crime,” and ‘“‘Here’s to You”’ as
well as new songs such as
“Operation,’”’ ‘‘Heat,’’ and
‘Merry Go Round.” Henderson
and Temple attracted the au-
diences attention with shout
vocals and a bit of showman-
ship. After the band closed the
second set, they reappeared for
two encores, the best of which
was ‘‘A Hard Day’s Night”’, that
left a great impression in
everone’s mind of the Pro-
ducers.

Dorm Renovation Could End By Junel

Bass Co.
Calls Job

‘Easiest’

by Rick Swagler

From the inside, the newly-
remodeled Graham-Lees dor-
mitory bears little resemblance
to the old structure. June 1 is
the projected completion date
for the $2.8 million renovation
which not only improves the liv-
ing conditions from previous
years, but also increases the

fire safety factor.
Concerning living conditions,

the structure will feature new
plumbing fixtures, doors, win-
dows, screens, and floor tiles.
The dorm will still be heated bv
the old radiators with the addi-
tion of a thermostat in each
room.

One of the biggest changes is
the construction of hallways
connecting the dorm’s three
wings. The building was:
originally constructed in three
separate sections with passage
between wings restricted to
emergencies.

Other conveniences include
water fountains in each hall and
phone outlets in most rooms.

Bill Wiseman, construction
superintendent for Bass Con-
struction, the firm in charge of
the renovation, said the dorm
remodeling was “‘one of the
easiest jobs we’ve had. We
didn’t have any problems at
all.”

Douglas Brady, projects
manager for the university,
said that the Bass Co. was
chosen by W&L because ‘‘we
had been pleased with the jobs
they’ve done for us in the past
with the University Library,
McCormick Hall, the Tucker
job, and 30 University Place.”’
Bass was given the job as
general contractor and, in turn,
took bids for subcontract work.

One factor making the work
easier is that fire codes govern-
ing old buildings are not par-
ticularly stringent. If an older
building is being renovated,
with its use to remain the same,
then it does not have to adhere
to the fire codes established for
newer buildings.

In the case of Graham-Lees,
the renovation has improved
the safety of the building to the
point that it will exceed even the
current standards for newly-
constructed edifices. This is ac-
complished through the exten-
sive use of smoke alarms and a
sprinkler system. Also ex-
ceeding the minimal require-
ment was the isolation of the
stairways for safer exits in
emergencies.

Lexington City Building In-
spector Leonard Reiss stated
that “‘the building is steel and
masonry construction, so it’s
almost fire-proof. The only

 

 

 

 

 

Renovation
Produces A
‘Taj Mahal’

 

“It’s like walking from the
ruins of Pompeii into the Taj
Mahal.” This was how Dean H.
Robert Huntley described the
transformation that has taken
place in the Graham-Lees Dor-
mitory.

Although the rent has been in-
creased to help pay for the
renovation, the dorm is ap-
parently destined to regain its
position as the most popular liv-
ing quarters on campus.

“Even when it was falling
down around our ears, it was
the most popular dorm. There is
an espirit de corps that exists in
the dorm,’”’ Huntley com-
mented, ©

 

| Facts About
Graham-Lees

The “new” dorm will hold 235
freshmen and 16 counselors. Of
these 235 freshmen, 163 will be
in single rooms and 72 will live
in doubles.

As was mentioned before,
rent has been increased. A
single in either Graham-Lees or
Gilliam will be $1,100 per year
while a double will cost $800 per
person. In Davis, a single will
‘| cost $1,200 while a double will
run at $850 per person. Because
of the opening of Graham-Lees,
freshmen will also not live off
campus. Davis will next year be
occupied by freshmen only,
with Baker being reserved for
law students.

The southwest corner of
Graham-Lees features facilities
for handicapped individuals.
Three singles have been reserv-
ed for handicapped students,
one of the rooms having a
private bathroom. A ramp for
students in wheelchairs is
located in the quad.

 

 

Huntley also noted that
refrigerators with a capacity of
2.5 cu. ft. will be allowed in the
dorms, but cooking will still be
forbidden.

Students should also be able
to find other alternatives to stu-
dying. “Unfortunately, 1
believe there will be facilities
for cable television throughout
the building,” Huntley com-
mented.

flammable materials are the
contents of the rooms.”
According to Brady, the
sprinkler system required a
large amount of piping in the
halls. To accomodate this, the

ceilings had to be lowered. The
lower ceiling, combined with
light-colored floor tiles, gives
the appearance of wider

The dorm building will still in-

clude the porch overlooking
Washington St., but the brick
benches in the quad will be
replaced with the wooden types
found around campus.

Probably the best news,

however, is the fact that con-
struction is two months ahead
of schedule, giving the universi-
ty plenty of time to furnish the
building before the freshmen
arrive next fall.

Nine Second Quarter Goals Down Hofstra

by John Harrison

The regular season for the
Washington and Lee. lacrosse
team comes to an end this
Saturday as they meet the
University of Maryland-
Baltimore County at 2 p.m. on
Wilson Field.

Head coach Richard Watts’
squad is led by senior
defensemen George McGeeney
and Scott Hundertmark, goalie
Matt Christian and midfielder
Craig Tucker.

On offense, the Retrievers are
‘a real isolation team and will
draw the ball in the slot,”’ offers
W&L intern assistant coach
Eric Kemp. ‘“‘they’re like some
club teams that force the ball in
the crease. They concentrate on
getting the ball to Tucker,”
Kemp adds.

Although U.M.B.C. is not
ranked in the U.S.I.L.A. poll,
the Retrievers led or were tied
with UVa for over three
quarters a week ago Wednes-
day before they lost, 9-8, in the
final three minutes.

Last Saturday the Generals

routed Hofstra 19-10 before 3,800

Wilson Field fans. W&L used a
9-0 blitz in the second quarter to
put the game out of reach for

The Military

the Flying Dutchmen.

Explained head coach Jack
Emmer, ‘‘We expected a tough,
physical team but it didn’t hap-
pen. They didn’t appear to be a
good road team.”

Seniors Rob Staugaitis and
John Sancilio used the match to
get themselves in W&L records.
Staugaitis’ seven assists (four
came in the decisive second
quarter) tied the mark set by
Ted Bauer in 1974 and Don Car-
roll a year later. The attackman
added a goal in the second
quarter and three more assists
in the second half to raise his
team-leading point total to 48.

Sancilio’s three second
quarter goals gave him 32 for
the season and broke the school
record for goals by a midfielder
in one year. ‘I think when you
look back at some of the mid-
dies we’ve had in the past, you
can really appreciate what he’s
done,”’ said Emmer.

The Generals were also led by
John Doub (five goals, one
assist), Lee’ Heimert and Jeff
Mason (three goals each), and
senior Mike Schuler (four
assists).

coach Emmer was pleased with
the team’s ability to hold on to

Generally Speaking

 

Considering Rain, Game

by G. Bruce Potter
Many people who saw
Washington and Lee destroy
Hofstra in lacrosse last Satur-
day said that the game was not
very good, even from the
Generals’ standpoint.

I beg to differ.
Keeping in mind the weather
(intermittent downpours

throughout the first half), the

Generals did a good job once-

they got off the ground after a
sluggish start that saw Hofstra

tally two quick goals in the first
2:12 of the contest.

However, Washington and
Lee really could not be held at
fault for the second goal. They
were in a “‘red-dog’”’ defense
that had two players on the man
with the ball and goalie Ware
Palmer covering another
player, thus leaving the net
open. Palmer -had no chance
when Hofstra got the ball in
play successfully.

he said. “Our schedule could

though, lost to Washington Col-
lege and Syracuse lost to Cort-

Was Good

Head Coach Jack Emmer
seems to have come up with
another gem (don’t worry, I
won’t mention the ‘‘Ar-
madillo”) with this special
defense as it did work the other
three times the squad tried it
during last Saturday’s game.

Hofstra players were forced
to hurry the ball, and Wash-
ington and Lee was able to gain
possession.

The Generals went on to blow
the game wide open in the se-
cond period by tallying nine
goals, three of them by John
Sancilio. However, they then
became rather complacent in
the third quarter, and, with
freshman John DiDuro in the
goal, gave up five goals as the
game was very suddenly much
closer.

When it counted down the
stretch, W&L scored five
straight goals to open the final
quarter and put the game out of
reach. It was truly a game that
the Generals controlled most of
the way except for the first few
minutes and the majority of the
third quarter. However, one
must remember that Emmer
had played everyone on the
roster except DiDuro before
halftime.

Quotes-Of- The- Year

From Heavenly Thanks

 

Doubleheader Split
Ends Baseball’sY ear

 

To Fallon’s SI Quote

by G. Bruce Potter
Coaches, athletes and fans are supposed to come
up with witty remarks now and then, and this year
has been no exception at Washington and Lee. Ac-
cordingly, here are the quotes-of-the-year for
1981-82:

“Bridgewater will have fire coming out of their
nostrils’’. nr

—Head basketball coach
Verne Canfield before a crucial
Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference contest.

“ don’t count on anybody until they are suited
up and running.”’

—Dick Miller cross-country
coach, on recruiting.

‘“‘But regardless of swimming in our own pool,
we’ll still be little fish in a big state pond.”’

—Page Remillard, swimming
coach, before his team hosted
the state swimming meet.

“Tm trying to feel my way out of our quarter-
back problem. I feel the best way to do this is to
look at all of our talent.’’

—Head football coach Gary
Fallon, after using five dif-
ferent quarterbacks in a 20-7
season-opening loss to Gettys-,
burg.

‘‘At about 2-14 miles, we crested a hill and Coach
Miller and the West Virginia Tech coach were
standing there. Neither of them said a word. I:
think the West Virginia Tech coach was in awe.
We asked Coach Miller (after the meet) why he
didn’t yell, and he said, ‘What can you say when
you have all your guys way ahead of their top guy,
and you’re only halfway through the race?”

—Frank Pittman describing
an incident in a cross-country
meet with West Virginia Tech, a
team the Generals shut out
15-47.
“The other regions all became very squeamish.

They only wanted representatives from their

region (as apposed to an at-large team from
across the country). That killed Washington and

Lee.”’ :
—Montclair State athletic

director William P. Dioguardi -

explaining why W&L didn’t
qualify for the NCAA Division
III basketball tournament. .

“I would not want to be this water polo team on

Monday. —Remillard, who also

coaches water polo, warns that
his team had better not lose all
three games at the upcoming
Bucknell Tournament.

“They ran faster than we did.”

—Miller’s enlightenting com-
ment on why his team lost to
Lynchburg in a cross-country
meet.
“It means something for other teams to beat
us.”’
—Canfield explaining his
teams poor road performance.
“If you’re gonna like sports, this is a good place
to like them.”
—W&L sports
director Ken Ries.

“Thank God for lacrosse.”

—An anonymous fan during

information

the Generals’ first football
game, a 20-7 loss to Gettysburg
College.

“We needed a Reggie Jackson-type incident and
this could be it. I think the team will rally around
it.”

—After a water polo player
had left campus for personal
reasons, Remillard remained
confident.

“Prospects are not just going to walk onto the
campus; they’re not going to just show up. We’ve
got to go out and make sure they’re aware of our,
lacrosse program, our academic programs
because they’re good ones — and sell the universi-

ty.’

—Head lacrosse Coach Jack

Emmer on recruiting.

“At a big meet like VMI, one has to set a goal
and stick with it. Anything beyond that is gravy.”
—Assistant Indoor Track Coach
Frank Miriello before the
ODAC Championships at VMI.

“At least we play Virginia.’

—At the lacrosse game
against William and Mary in
Williamsburg on April 13, a
W&L fan responded to an In-
dian fan’s charge that “You
guys don’t stand a chance
against Virginia.”’

“Next thing you know, they’ll be asking for
soap.”

—This quote by Fallon was
reprinted in Sports Illustrated
magazine and came after his
players complained of a lack of
hot water.

“We’re not going to go out there and just play
the game and run up and down the field.”

—Emmer two days before us-
ing the “Armadillo” slowdown
against the University of North
Carolina.

The science of sound

by Andrew P. Hoppes

Washington and Lee’s
baseball squad closed out its
season Saturday by splitting a
doubleheader with Christopher
Newport to finish with a 9-20
record.

The Generals turned in an all-
around superb performance in
their opening game — an 11-5
win. W&L collected 14 hits in the
game with junior Jim Daly rip-
ping four hits and classmate
Chris Cavalline belting a solo
home run. Freshman Billy
White picked up the win for the
Generals.

W&L lost a 1-0 heart-
wrencher in the second game,
wasting a fine pitching effort by
senior Rich Hachenberg.
Hachenberg yielded only three
hits and one run, but the
Generals were scoreless despite
notching six hits and walking

and freshmen Miles Spencer
and Chip Hutchins.

While several underclassmen
improved, this was the last year
of collegiate baseball for nine
Generals. ‘“‘We’re losing some
super seniors,’’ Murdock
declared. Graduating starters
are Thad Ellis, Tripp Brower,
Jeff Haggerty, and Mark
McLaughlin. Lost from the
pitching corps will be David
Randall, Rich Hachenberg, Jim
Brockelman, Jim Stanley and
Don Dudley.

Statistically, junior Chris
Cavalline led the 1982 Generals
in batting with a .340 mark.
Cavalline also led the team with
four home runs. ;

Senior co-captains Jeff Hag-
gerty and Thad Ellis also had
fine seasons at the plate. Hager-
ty led the team in runs-batted-in
with 21, while batting .298 and

seven times. ae two home runs. Ellis

“We don’t play any ‘gimmes’
on our schedule. 7
I like a good, competitive schedule.”

   

Although W&L’s 9-20 record
appears completely unim-
pressive, the Generals played
an extremely rough schedule.
During the season W&L faced
Division I teams like Duke,
William & Mary and V.M.I. and
several Division II schools.

‘“‘We don’t play any ‘gimmes’
on our schedule,’’ noted Coach
Jim Murdock. “I like a good,
competitive schedule.”’

Although the season was not
as successful as expected, Mur-
dock pointed out some signs of
improvement. ‘‘Billy White was
a bright spot this year,’’ he said,
in reference to the freshman
pitcher who had W&L’s lowest
earned run average.

“The team defense was im-
proved and the offense also im-
proved a bit,’’ Murdock stated.

Murdock also observed im-
provement in several in-
dividuals. ‘“‘All the under-
classmen really developed this
‘year. Even some of the
freshmen showed develop-
ment,’’ Players Murdock sing-
led out as most improved were
sophomores Mike Walsh, Dave
Warrenfeltz, and Kevin Golden

was second in runs-batted-in
with 17 and hit .269 with one
home run.

Freshman Billy White was
W&L’s leading hurler. White
had a 3.69 ERA and a 1-3 record
with one save.

Seniors David Randall and
Rich Hachenberg also had good
years on the hill. Randall was
3-3 with a 4.53 ERA and a team-
leading 37 strikeouts.
Hachenberg was 3-5 with a 5.19
ERA.

Murdock already expressed
optimism about next year’s
team. ‘‘We’ll be able to put a
returning letterman at every
position next year except first
base and catcher. We need
some pitching,’’ Murdock
stated in reference to the
decimation of the pitching corps
by graduation.

“I think we have a basis for
the coming years. We've
developed a leadership corps in-
stead of depending on one or
two kids like this year,’’ Mur-
dock optimistically asserted.

classical structure and what is
perhaps the most profoundly
moving willingness to suspend
easy moral judgment that the
history of cinema has yet
known. In the Neorealist direc-
tors, filmmakers like Roberto
Rossellini and Vittorio de Sica
who were active in Italy after
World War II, Ray found a
documentary-like receptivity to
the look of ordinary life.

Ray’s films are remarkable
for their warmth, understate-
ment, and visual harmony. In
Days and Nights in the Forest,
which is Ray’s favorite among

his own films, four men from
Calcutta encounter new friends

in the Indian countryside. City
and country momentarily
mingle and then separate in this

Certainly, all of the squad
played very well, and that
makes it extremely difficult to
hand out individual laurels. But
there were a couple of players
whose play stood out throughout
the game.
Senior

co-captain Rob

Staugaitis tied a school record .

with seven assists, four of them
in the crucial second stanza.
And he was even shaken up for
a brief period when a frustrated
Hofstra goalie decided it was
time for a cheap shot. Whether
skirting the sidelines for a
ground ball, circling the net
looking for an open man or

breaking up a Hofstra clear,
Staugaitis was all over the field.

Also, sophomore goalie Phil
Aiken once again demonstrated
why he earned the starting job.
Playing only three quarters,
Aiken came up with 15 saves,
and he now has 72 saves in only
seven appearances, __

All in all, it was a fine perfor-
mance by the Generals and a
very good comeback from a
series of losses and difficult
wins. The only question that re-
mains is whether or not the
magnaminity of the defeat will
have any impact on the NCAA
playoff selection committee.

“T felt like I had been lied to,”’
said Einstein who, after
discussing the incident with
Dean Dan Murphy and Mayor
Charles Phillips, filed a com-
plaint on the following Friday.

The department issued two
other noise warnings that night
in addition to Chi Psi’s. A party
in Red Square received a warn-
ing in the late afternoon and a
party behind the Phi Kappa

because of noise.

A subcommittee of the Inter-

been formed to study the issue

Presently noise permits within
the city only last until 11 p.m.

to negotiate an extension of that

Magazine Review:

Political Magazine May

by R.W. Fenstermacher

At Washington and Lee, there
has been a long tradition of
political involvement on
various levels. Many of this
school’s alumni have had
political careers. Quadrenially
since 1908, participants in the
Mock Convention have attemp-
ted to predict (with quite a bit of
success) the out-of-office par-
ty’s candidate for the presiden-
tial elections. Now, there is the
Washington and Lee Political
Review.

In a footnote, editors-in-chief
Eric Anderson and David Black
explain that the purpose of the
new magazine ‘‘is to provide a
forum for the _ politically
aware.”’ The Review itself ‘‘has
no particular ideological bias,”
rather the editors’ goal is ‘‘ex-
cellence in expression, not
ideological purity.”

Articles appear on various
topics. The topics range from
the Equal Rights Amendment
and Social Security to the Polish
and Palestinian situations.
Special contributions come
from Clark Mollenhoff
(Reagan, Watt and Executive
Privilege) and visiting law pro-
fessor Richard Tyler (Reflec-
tions on the E.R.A.”’).

Although the magazine is sup-

Pryor ——

(continued from page 3)
ny.

However, the film is not total-
ly filled with only jokes and
devoid of any “‘message’’ in-
deed there are several strong
ones. Two especially strong
scenes have Pryor talking
about his trip to Africa, and his
battle with cocaine addiction.
While presented in a humorous
manner, they still have much to
say.
The film lasts about 90
minutes, a little longer than his
first concert film, and packs a
stronger punch. The old Pryor
is there, still as funny as ever,
but now there is something
more which really makes this
film expressive as well as
hilarious.

After an article in Time
magazine, a woman wrote into
the journal complaining that
anyone who used so many ‘“‘dir-
ty words” should not even be
allowed to make movies. Ob-
viously, such a woman has pro-
bably never seen this movie.
While there are ‘‘dirty words’’,
they serve a purpose and in this
movie, that final purpose is ad-
mirable.

Pryor is funny but, moreover,
he is effective. He has learned
that the best time to break
through that all too thick a bar-
rier of prejudice is to attack
when the defenses are lowest.
Therefore while the audience is
busy laughing over one of
Pryor’s stories, that message
slips in behind the laughter to
work little by little at the bar-

Have Too Limited Range

posed to have no ideological
bias, there appear no articles
which one can say were written
from a conservative outlook.
The articles present middle-of-
the-road to liberal views. Con-

keeps them in order while
swathed in a sheet and wielding
a whip, much as a circus trainer

menagerie of wild beasts. The
implicit question is whether

may or may not complete his
film. We only see him in the
circus-like ending joining the
circle which contains all the
figures from his past and pre-
sent who have troubled him,
