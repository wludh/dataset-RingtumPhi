Washington and Lee may see the arrival this year of a new
"emity on campus in place of an old one. The Sigma Phi Epsilon
tional Board of Directors decided at their meeting in May to close
tshington and Lee’s chapter. The former Washington and Lee
;Ep members are now working to start an Alpha Delta Phi chapter
campus.

The former SigEp brothers say their chapter was closed be-
1se they did not follow the fraternity’s Balanced Man Program.

IQ. “While the Balanced Man Program (BMP) is a voluntary pro-

.m, SigEp has slowly been converting all its chapters to the BMP,”
Ishington and Lee SigEp President Chris Colby said.

“SigEp nationals can by no means withdraw a charter strictly
red on the fact that that particular chapter is balanced man, but
y can create false allegations and seize it based on those allega-
ns.”

The SigEp national website says the Balanced Man Program is
four year membership development program.” The organization

* fl yes that through this program they can tackle problems like inad-

1ate community and campus involvement and tear down the “frat
y” stereotype.

This program would also do away with pledgeship, giving mem-
‘s full privileges from day one.

SigEp says the BMP has nothing to do with Washington and
e’s chapter losing their charter. SigEp Communications Director
)tt Thompson said each chapter decides to implement the BMP

 .y through vote. Eighty percent of the chapter must vote in favor

the program for it to pass.
Thompson attributed the revocation of Washington and Lee’s
Ipter to risk management concerns and declining grades, not the

A k of the BMP.

SigEp’s national minimum required grade point average is 2.5.
an Dawn Watkins said that Washington and Lee’s chapter met
minimum required GPA.

“We were by no means in danger of falling below the minimum,”

" lby said. ~

Professor David Peterson became SigEp’s academic advisor in 2000.
went to dinner at the house once a semester. Peterson was also
Iilable to give academic advice to any of the brothers who requested it.

ZCDES revokes W&L charter, new frat ay

“There were a number of bright members and good students in
SPE,” Peterson said.

Colby said Washington and Lee’s chapter participates in many

campus activities and is involved in the community.
The brothers held a Toys for Tots drive last year and bowled with
the Lexington Special Olympics team. The chapter also has brothers
on the swim team, tennis team, cross country and track teams, and
baseball team.

They also belong to academic societies, work for student pub-
lications, serve as dorm counselors, peer counselors, peer tutors,
pre—orientation leaders, and participate in Mock Convention.
Allegations of alcohol abuse were also made against the chapter.

“Did we throw parties? Yes. Did we abuse alcohol? No,” Colby
said. “The fact that Alpha Delta Phi is willing to take our brother-
hood as one of its chapters is indicative of the fact that the brothers
did nothing to provoke the revocation of its SigEp charter.”

Sophomore Adam McAllister is trying to remain positive about his
fratemity’s situation, “We’re still having a good time, but it stinks to not
be able to live with everyone in the house. We’re working on having a
good fall and getting the Alpha Delts here in the winter,” he said.

Despite any questions over accusations against the chapter,
the university has no control over the closing of the SigEp chapter.
According to the Student Handbook, a fraternity must be in good
standing with its nationals in order to remain on campus.

The IFC must now take a vote in order to approve bringing
Alpha Delta Phi to campus. If approved, the new members of Alpha
Delta Phi will not be able to take the old SigEp house.

SigEp nationals holds the lease to the house and will keep it in
case it comes back to campus in several years.

Colby said that even if the IFC does not vote to accept Alpha Delta
Phi, they will still exist on campus.

“Whether or not the university recognizes Alpha Delta Phi as an
official Washington and Lee fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi will recognize
our brotherhood as a legitimate Alpha Delta Phi chapter,” Colby said.

Dean Watkins said Alpha Delta Phi could possibly be violating
the Comity of the North American Interfratemity Conference (NIC) if
it allows former SigEp members to join its fraternity. The NIC does
not allow one fraternity to receive members from another fraternity.

Colby said that the former members of Washington and Lee’s
chapter are no longer afﬁliated with SigEp, referring to the letter that
SigEp nationals sent to parents this summer. The letter said that the

said the former members will not try to become alumni.

“What everyone needs to understand is that we are not cre

a brotherhood under different greek letters.”

“W&L won’t be W&L if we have the second-best fac-

Burish announced last spring that the main issues to be ad-

status as a stellar liberal arts university, faculty scholarship, fac-

demic rigor, coordinating the undergraduate calendar with the law

Three calendar reports were released on September 3 ti
discuss the possibilities for three different calendar systems

“The 13-13-4 calendar is, by its very nature, a comp:

W&L administrator resigns
because of sodomy charges

BY ERIN ]UI.IUs
NEWS EDITOR

David Long, Washington and Lee’s vice presi-
dent for university relations, was charged with so-
licitation to commit sodomy and assault and battery
over the summer. Long was arrested in Pennsylvania
on July 30. It’s unclear why Long was charged with
assault.

The charges stemmed from a sting operation on a
Harrisonburg adult bookstore. A Harrisonburg grand
jury indicted Long and 25 other men on 34 charges fol-
lowing a three—month investigation of Harrisonburg Adult
News.

According to a Harrisonburg police news release,
the investigation had utilized undercover work by an
officer inside the store and video surveillance of the
store’s parking lot. The 26 men were indicted on charges
ranging from misdemeanor indecent exposure to sodomy.

Long was arrested in Pennsylvania after crashing into

a parked car. The officer that investigated the crash d
covered the outstanding warrants for Long and arrest
him.

Long, who was head of Washington and Lee’s co
munications, development and alumni relations depa
ments, was placed on administrative leave with pay
July and resigned “for personal reasons” on August i

He worked in fund raising at W&L since 1988. Tr
White, Washington and Lee’s communications direc‘
has called Long a, “valued and dedicated employee” a
said the school is aware of the indictment but does 1
know the facts of the case so it’s, “withholding comm:
and judgment.”

Long lives in Lexington with his wife and thr

sons.

The Supreme Court recently struck down Texa.
anti-sodomy law, however, Virginia’s law against sc
omy has not been repealed. Virginia court has uphc
its sodomy law in cases where the offenses were co:
mitted in public.

Jniversity bans music sharing

dministration stops lawsuits before they happen, questions of Honor left up to Executive Committee

BY ANDREW LATIMER AND JEB BROOKS
CONTIBUTING EDITOR AND EDITOR IN CHIEF

On-campus residents in search of free music and movies this week found nothing
)ut frustration as university ofﬁcials enacted measures to stop illicit ﬁle sharing over Wash-
ngton and Lee’s connection to the Internet.

The ban, which is expected to be announced formally by Provost Thomas Williams
JVltl'lll‘l several days, has already affected users of popular “peer-to-peer” applications such
IS KaZaA, iMesh, Morpheus and Audiogalaxy. Currently, special equipment and software
lesigned to analyze data on the school’s network has been set to allow certain types of
rafﬁc, like viewing web pages and sending e-mail, while blocking the offending programs.

The move marks the latest chapter in the school’s struggle with protecting its com-
nunity from an increasingly aggressive nationwide legal assault
)n ﬁle swapping, spearheaded by the Recording Industry Asso-
ziation of America (RIAA) and Motion Picture Association of
America (MPAA). The organizations, which claim billions of dol-
ars in losses due to widespread music and movie piracy, zero in
)n its targets by tracing the addresses of illegal users back to their
nstitutions or Internet service providers, or ISPs.

If contacted by industry lawyers, the university must now
iand over the names of the sharers for prosecution instead of
Jeing left to deal with the problem on its own as it did in past
:ases. By late August, the RIAA had issued over 1,145 subpoe-
ias with dozens being added every day, with ﬁnes as hefty as
517,500 per song illegally distributed. “That’siwhat we’re ner-
/ous about,” said Dean of Students Dawn Watkins, who participated on a six—member ad
ioc cormnittee established by former Provost Larry Boetsch last fall to examine the com-
Jlexities of online rights and ﬁle sharing.

With pressure mounting as the new school year approached, the body recom-
nended complete barring peer—to—peer activity. In an e-mail dated July 28, Director of
Jniversity Computing John Stuckey made it clear that “the stakes are too high not to do
ivhat we can, even at the cost of a likely howl of protest.”

A random survey of the freshman dormitories revealed confusion and indigna-
ion about university actions. With no ofﬁcial notice, word about the ban spread through
:ampus at first as a rumor when all attempts to trade or search for ﬁles ended in failure.

THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH NOT TO DO WHAT
WE CAN, EVEN AT THE COST OF A LIKELY
HOWL OF PROTEST

---- DIRECTOR OF UNIV. COMPUTING JOHN
STUCKEY

“Now I’ve lost one of my biggest reasons for moving back to the Hill,"
said one upperclassman who asked to remain anonymous. Some looked at the
effort as an extreme tactic to save university bandwidth. Dawn Watkins re-
gards the latest policy revision as motivated by the potential of serious legal
threats.

‘The users are the ones being held liable. We just want to make sure that this doesn’1
happen to our students. The use of such (sharing) software has been banned from faculty anc
staff computers for at least a year; now students face that same ban,” Watkins said.

Whether or not ﬁle sharing is an honor violation is a matter that will be left to the
Executive Committee, which so far has not indicated its views on the issue. Yet the change-
is sure to prompt campus discussion on “media theﬁ.”

In a recent announcement by the RIAA, amnesty has been promised for
downloaders who agree to delete the ﬁles that they share anc
agree to no longer share files.

For now, Professor Sarah Wiant, professor of copy-
right law at the Washington and Lee School of Law, and Uni-
versity Computing have advice for network users. Among their
are deleting illegal music ﬁles, disabling the sharing features 01
KaZaA and other peer-to-peer programs and consulting the
documents at the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s website at
ww.eff.org.

According to HelpDesk manager John White, students whc
bring their computers for service will not be policed. “We can’t
expect people to come in if they think that we’re going to turr
them in,” he said. Only if the sharing software affects the perfor-
mance of the computer will it be dealt with, he said.

The data analysis equipment that blocks ﬁle trading, dubbed a “packet shaper,” is
also not intended to be intrusive. While it can determine the type of data being sent over
the network, it does not scrutinize the speciﬁc ﬁles or names passing through the university’:
servers. Last fall, the packet shaper was implemented to keep peer—to—peer traders frorr
swamping Washington and Lee’s connection. -

Off-campus students who do not rely on the university’s Internet service will
not fall under the jurisdiction of the Provost’s decision or the packet shaper. Addi-
tionally, students who purchase songs through legal download services like
BuyMusic.com and the Apple iTunes Music Store are unaffected.

Welcome to the new Washington and Lee

BY TIM SMITH
Al§X1liFll{A'llI)llD

Welcome, incoming freshmen, to the ﬁfth great-
; party school in the country. Welcome to the
tion’s 12th ranked liberal arts college. Welcome to
: most revered Greek system in all of academia.
elcome to Lex Vegas. It’s great to have you all here
the NEW W&L.

That’s right - this isn’t the W&L you expected.
lis isn’t the W&L you meant to apply to. This is
lifferent school. Confused?? Let me explain.

Washington and Lee is a school absolutely
rothered in rich tradition. It’s a beloved place to
tually every person who once walked the Colon-
de. But the W&L they remember is not the school
u will know. W&L is changing. It is changing as
u read this article.

Change has always haunted W&L. This is a
100l that thrives on tradition, depending on the
st to give us our academic identity. Without those
ditions, W&L has no identity. But tradition and
ange are rarely compatible things, and so
rogress” in Lexington has typically not been a
erished process. When you rely on the past so
avily, it’s tough to face the future’ with a smile.

After a cheating scandal, W&L left big-time
rletics behind. It’s tough to imagine UVA or Tech

Maryland playing at Wilson Field, but it hap-
ned. From what I’ve heard, that was a tough
ange to swallow. Co—education was another hot
.ue, but in the 1980s, that change was also made.
lat brings us to the still current issue that has
zked Lexington for the past 6 months - the won-
rful Spring Term question.

Spring Term will eventually say goodbye. Any-
e who does not recognize this fact is in denial.
re decision has probably already been made — it’s
lt the matter of when it all ﬁnally plays out. It will

a tough change to experience, as well. But even
)re disturbing, perhaps, is the foreboding signs
rrounding our beloved fraternities. Over the sum-
in our school’s chapter of Sig Ep was removed
rm campus. And though the university played

part in kicking Sig Ep off, and may in fact have
ed to save that fraternity, the loss may carry some

implications about the future of fratemities in Lex-
ington. -

The signs are not good. The new alcohol poli-
cies deprived us of tailgating and drinking games,
and while that change seems irrelevantly minor, it
was certainly a big deal at the time.

tially take away

.’rinceton Review releases academic, social rankings

BY JEB Brrooxs
EDITOR l'N CHIEF

The Princeton Review recently released its rankings for the Best
1 Colleges. Washington and Lee received top marks in several cat-

ories.

According to the rankings, Washington and Lee University stu-
nts are taught well, socially active and politically conservative. The
rvey says that students at the University have very caring profes-
rs, miss Republican President Ronald Reagan and consume a lot of

xohol.

The Review uses open ended questions to gain further insight into
mpus life. Washington and Lee is described by one of its own stu-
nts as a “little utopian society” that offers “really small classes” and
‘strong sense of community among the students, faculty and admin-

ration.”

Another student says that Washington and Lee has “a stu-
nt body like a country club: white, well-off, Republican.”
re same student goes on to say that, “My little Neon is parked
~xt to a Lexus, a Saab and a brand new SUV — in the freshman

t!”

One other student states that, “‘Work hard, drink hard’ is our

Jtto.”

The Review uses current students to rank their schools in cat-
ories ranging from Parties to Politics. 106,245 students were
kedi to rate their own institutions based on the 2002-2004 aca-

mic year.

In addition to its rankings, the Princeton Review is well known
r its test preparation courses, admission and education services,

d books.

N hat the hell’s a Ring-tum Phi?

re grand old traditions and early Washington and Lee newspaper scandals: reprinted from The Ring-tum Phi of Tuesday, Dec. 5, 1967.

Back in the days when telephones (all 68 of
:m in Lexington, an advertisement boasted) were
own as “up-to-date electric call bells,” back when
‘aling a bell—clapper was called “a naughty-one’s
rlic,” in the same year that the New York Post
nferred on this city (really) the title “Athens of
: Sout ” — there came into being a little newspa-
r published weekly, “by the students for the
ishington and Lee University community,” and
med after the most popular of that University’s
)tball cheers: “Ring-tum Phi.”

“Coincident with the administration of Presi-
nt Wilson begins the career of a new publication
Washington and Lee, The Ring-tum Phi. The
rig-tum Phi is a weekly journal and presents a
:asing appearance. It meets a distinct need in
2 University and relieves the Collegian of what
merly has tended only to clog and retard.”

terary Magazine

“The Collegian is primarily a literary magazine,
:1 when the editors heretofore were forced to cram
3 limitless number of locals, they always bewailed
: dismal incongruity. Henceforth, we rejoice to
1, the Collegian is freed from matters of this kind,
d will both be compelled to try to serve two ends

“Gentlemen of The Ring-tum Phi, you have
our best wishes. Gentlemen of The Ring-tum Phi,
we give our sincerest thanks. Students of W. and
L., we congratulate you on the advent of the long
needed weekly!”

The year was 1897. The Southern Collegian
was still a high-quality magazine, being published
by the Graham Literary Society. The Ring-tum Phi
was designed to be a somewhat lighter, perhaps
even ribald, complement to the Collegian.

Eighteen and ninety-seven. The year the foot-
ball coach had to send away for a special noseguard
“to protect the colossal proboscis which accompa-
nies Mr. Fitzhugh’s countenance.” (“Mr.” Fitzhugh
was a student; everybody then was Mister or Doc-
tor of Professor or Reverend.)

Scandalous Verse

Eighteen and ninety-seven. The year of the
Great Hell Scandal. It seems the very ﬁrst editor-in-
chief, George.Houston, in the fourth issue of the
neophyte newspaper, published a column of “Foot-
ball Songs,” one of which was included with this
verse:
“Each other’s back, boys
“Has got a knack, boys,

ll

“Round the end.

“And it’s a sin, sir,

“For Oberlin (a W&L player), sir,

“To buck the V.M.I. boys’ line so awfully hard.
“Then join the yell, boys,

“And yell like hell, boys,

“Sure enough.

“To W&L U., boys,

“And foot-ball, too, boys,

“Let’s give a rousing, rumbling, roaring football
yell.

“Ring-tum Phi, stickeri bum,

“&c, &c.”

Well, hell broke loose. The next issue,
an incensed letter-to-the-editor writer (we
told you things haven’t changed much)
said:

“There appeared in the columns of The Ring-
tum Phi, last week, a song which, to the very
thoughtful person had very little to recommend
it. . .The only thing that I can see that would have
recommended it to the editorial eye is the little
smack of naughtiness which makes the ﬁrst
rhyme in the last verse.

“The Editor seems to be ﬁlled with pride to
even know the author; he puts the verse in the

editorial commending it as ‘especially
good.’ He says the words tire the voice a
little.

“Now everyone, who knows anything of the
subject, knows that the sound of that ‘h’ has a
very rasping effect on the vocal chords. How
much better it would have been had the line read:
‘And yell right well, boys.’ It would have
sounded better, been easier on the voice, and
would have saved the writer and Editor from
showing their weakness.

“It can be admitted that, to some eyes, there is
something worthy of admiration in a dark, purple
crime, but to bow before a sinlet like this is weak-
ness personiﬁed.

“In the future let me suggest that the Editor
follow the path of virtue. He will not only ﬁnd it
pleasant, but may keep himself from showing his
lack of taste.

_R”

Well, “R.” intimidated Mr. Houston. Who
wouldn’t be intimidated if he were editing a brand-
new paper that nobody, not even students, had
ever heard of, named The Ring-tum Phi; and some-
body came along and accused him of printing sinlets
