Comer could spend four and a halfyears in
jail, the unserved portion of his ﬁve-year
sentence for the March 1989 death of W&L
freshman Mary Ashley Scarborough.

0 Comer, who came to court with his wife of

one day and his parents, said Thursday he was
prepared to go to jail and wanted to take part
in an alcohol treatment program.

In a lengthy account of what he had done
since getting out of jail in September 1990,
Comer told the court about his Georgia arrest

he was returning to his home in Winder, Ga.,

with friends in Athens, Ga., about 20 miles
from Winder. He said he was pulled over for
speeding in Statharn, Ga., and registered a .16
blood-alcohol content on abreathalyzer, twice
‘the state’s legal limit.

He pleaded no contest to the DUI and
speeding charges in September and was given
a $44 fine because he had attended an alco-
hol-awareness seminar.

Comer acknowledged Thursday that he

had been intoxicated the night he hit
Scarborough in 1989 and saidhe didnot drink
alcohol for several months after getting out of

jail.

He said he started drinking again because
he was having problems socializing at the
University of Georgia.

Comer said he didnot realize he was drunk
when he tried to drive home in May and could
not recall in court how many
drinks he had.

“So after not drinking for
[a few months], you had got
to drinking again where you
cou1dn’tremember how many
drinks you had,” Sisler asked.

“I was talking with my
friends and not counting my
drinks,” Comer said. “I guess
I should have been.”

“You were lucky there was
not another Miss Scarborough
in that little Georgia town
when you went zooming
through,” Sisler said.

Comer was prompted in
his account by his lawyer, Thomas Spencer,
who told Bumgardner that he was not there
“to advocate for leniency, but to help Blake
talk about what has happened since he got out
of jail.”

Comer said he did odd jobs

with a Georgia clothing company. In May, he
was told he would be promoted to a salesman
on June 1, so he and his girlfriend got en-
gaged. _
Comer told the court he was celebrating
his engagement and promotion with his friends
on the night of his May arrest.

Comer said he wanted to break off his
engagement before he went back to jail, but
his ﬁancee wanted to prove her devotion to
him. They were married Wednesday, one day
before Comer’s probation hearing.

Comer, who covered up his involvement
in Scarborough’s death and was arrested on
an anonymous tip eight months after the
accident, said he immediately told his South
Carolina probation officer about his May
arrest.

“I was told by people that I didn’t have to
tell him, that he wouldn’t find out,” Comer
said. “But I wanted to.”

Comer’ s father asked Bumgardner to pun-
ish his son in a way that would not entail
returning to jail.

“Blake tried very hard to lead what people
would call an exemplary life,” Braxton Comer
said. “His drinking was not dangerous, bad,
excessive. It was just this night.”

When Bumgardner revoked Comer’s sus-
pended sentence, there was a stir in the court-
room as media photographers and camera-

men stood

between the time he was re-
leased in September 1990 and

up to get
their equip-

when he enrolled in the Uni-
versity of Georgia in January
1991 . He said that during that
time he spoke to three church
youth groups about his expe-
rience.

“I told them about what I
had done and about the night-
mares and stuff I had lived
with,” Comer said. “It made
me feel good to do something
good for someone else.”
