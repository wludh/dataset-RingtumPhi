EC has an extra $30,000
for allocation to student groups

By FRANCESCA KEFALAS
Phi Staff Writer

' The Student Activities Board requested a whopping
$74,895 from the Executive Committee Wednesday night,
about $25,000 more than they received last year.

The SAB proposal includes plans to spend $64,265 on
entertainment, about $22,000 more than last year, and
$5,280 on publicity, more than twice last year's publicity
budget.

9 Hobson Barnes, SAB vice chairman and treasurer, said
$9000 of the request would go to get the Spin Doctors at the
Pavilion on the Thursday before Christmas weekend. SAB
has not sponsored an event on that night before.

SAB chairman Robyn McCord said the increase in
publicity is an attempt to increase attendance at SAB events.
She said the effect of more publicity has already resulted in
at increased turnout for SAB interviews.

The StudentBar Association asked the EC for $51 ,925.62.
SBA treasurer Andrew Colocotronis said the money will
help fund 22 organizations in the Law School. Colocotronis
said SBA funds organizations regardless of partisanship or
religious affiliation.

SBArequested $47,999.06 last year andreceived$41,000.
Colocotronis said the larger request is mostly due to an
increase in the cost of supplies.

Contact requested $29,500 from the EC, $7,550 more
than last year. Contact Chair David DeMilt said Contact
expects to get one major speaker and ﬁve or six other
speakers for the coming year.-DeMilt said major speakers,
such as author Robert Fulghum, can cost from $8,000 to

10,000.

s The Graham-Lee-Washington Literary Society requested
$5000 from the EC. GLW Society Co-Chairman Cameron
Humphries said literary societies were the most important
educational and social aspects of W&L for 100 years. The
GLW society was founded last spring and is asking the EC
for money for the first time.

The EC has about $30,000 more than last year to allocate
R) student organizations thanks to a $15 increase in the
student activities fee and a $29,000 budget surplus from the
1991-92 year.

The 1991 -92 EC began last year with $205,408, $14,150
of which was a surplus from the previous year. They allotted
$199,150 to student organizations. The current EC has
$234,000 to give to student organizations.

’ EC President Josh MacFar1and said the EC wants to
insure that the budget benefits the most students.

‘ ‘We're looking to give the most funding to groups that
benefit the most or the majority of the student body,"
MacFarland said. ‘

Budget hearings began Monday and will finish tonight.
The EC will deliberate on the budget requests in a public
meeting Monday at 7 p.m..

In other E.C. business, the first-year law class elected
Kevin Webb,'88, to the EC. Webb said being away from
W&L made him appreciate the Honor System. ‘ ‘One of the
reasons I wanted to come back to W&L was the Honor
System,” Webb said. “lnthe EC, you're inacommittee that

deals with both the undergraduates and the law school.”

Fomial Rush ended Sunday with 91 percent
of men who participated pledging a fraternity.

Phi Kappa Psi pledged the largest class, 35, a
result Phi Psi Rush Chairman Steve Johnson
attributes to the total involvement of the actives
in the rush process.

“Everything was unified. The seniors got
motivated and there was a lot of cooperation

throughout the house, ”Johrison said. “I think the

freshmen were attracted to that.”

On the other side of the Rush results, Lambda
Chi Alpha and Chi Psi pledged the smallest
classes, five and three respectively.

Lambda Chi Treasurer Allen Flickinger said
only tearing five pledges will not cause financial
problems.

‘ ‘We're existing smoothly right now,”
Flickinger said. “This won't affect us overall.”

Lambda Chi Rush Chairman John Godfrey
said he would like to see some changes in the
Rush process, but said he is not sure what is
needed.

“I think the present sign-up system is screwy.
Lot s of freshman suicided other houses and
didri’t get bids at all,” Godfrey said. “I think our
distance from campus hurt us too."

Chi Psi House Manager Mark Connelly said
not having a fully renovated house may have hurt
their Rush. However, he said they were pleased
with their three-man pledge class.

“We always say it’s quality, not quantity,"
Connelly said.

Rush left freshmen with a variety of impres-
sions. ‘

Beta Theta Pi pledge Andy Vota said he chose
Beta because he felt the most comfortable there
and had a great time. ,

Other freshmen think the Rush process could
be improved.

‘ ‘I think Rush was too formal and political,”
Sigma Chi pledge Chad Dobbins said. “I went
with the people I knew the best and the house I
felt was right for me,” he said. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon pledge Curt Futch said he felt there was
not enough time to make a decision.

“Rush takes too long, but it’s still hard to get
to know everybody. I felt like I had to suicide
rush in order to make a decision,” Futch 

Even female freshman seem concerned about
the Rush process.

New rules lead to fewer injuries

By GREGORY PATTERSON
Phi News Editor

New Tear Night rules designed to
reduce injuries and alcohol violations
seem to have worked.

According to administration and
security officials, one student sus-
tained a minor injury Friday, the first
Tear Night under regulations passed
last spring by the Iriterfraternity Coun-
cil.

Last year, seven students were
treated at Stonewall Jackson Hospital
for injuries including a broken leg and
a concussion. Last spring, the IFC
mandated an alcohol-free period from

5 p.m. to 8 pm. onTear Night when
bids must be accepted

Dean of Freshmen and Residence
Life Dennis Marming said one fresh-

man cut his chin and needed stitches
when he slipped on a dance ﬂoor.

Overall, Manning said he was
pleased with the weekend.

“It was a success for the adminis-
tration as far as personal injuries and
trips to the hospital," Manning said.“l
hope we can keep this track record in
the future.”

Dean of Students David L.
Howison said there were only two
alcohol-related student arrests Friday.
Howison attributed the taming ofTear
Night to IFC President Sam Rock and
Vice President Tom Washmon.

“Sam and Tom met with the fresh-
men Thursday night and told them to
act responsibly,”Howison said. “This
is a student success.”

Security, infirrnary and police of-
ficials agreed that Friday’sTearNight
was a departure from the past.

babes."

“I've been here for twenty years
and this was the best one ever,” secu-
rity officer Thomas “Baner” Bane
said. “It was not the wild carrying on
like in the past."

At the ‘Student Health Center,
which last year was filled withpassed-
out students, Nurse Jane Wheeling
said no one came in Friday night.

Lexington Police Chief B.M.
Beard said the new rulesaccomplished
their purpose.

“Things went well,” Beard said.
“Something must have worked.”

One fraternity member said the
new regulations slowed, but did not
stop, the traditional Tear rituals.

“I think after [8 p.rn.], people did
what they had always done, but it was
less intense,” Pi Kappa Alpha Vice
President Walter Todd said. “Overall

liberal arts colleges.

“We realize that these rankings tend
to mislead students,” Associate Direc-
tor of Admissions Dan Murphy said.
“Ultimately, the best college is the one
the students pick as best for them.”

Murphy said the survey is impor-
tant because most prospective college
students are attracted by high-proﬁle
schools. Being in the top 25 makes
W&L very visible, he said.

Although ranked 9th in ‘student se-
lectivity, W&L is rated 49th in f'man-
cial resources and 41 st in student satis-
faction. Although these categories bring
W&L’soverall ranking down, the num-
bers are not as clear-cut as they seem.

The financial resources ranking is
determined by dividing the school's

operating budget by the number of
students, according to Assistant to the
President Tom Litzenburg who com-
piled W&L’s statistics for the survey.

W&L’s operating budget is lower
than other liberal arts schools because
of low tuition and the fact that W&L
does not use tuition revenue to fund
scholarships, Litzenburg said. If W&L
raised tuition and used the extra in-
come to fund scholarships, the rankings
would rise.

The student satisfaction ranking is

Students agreed that W&L could only benefit from
the increased exposure.

Sophomore Lucy Cavett said, “It’s good publicity -
especially since it is the third year in a row that we've
been number one in this category."

“Parents are definitely looking for the lowest prices

and the best deal," freshman Julie Sauers said.

According to Kozak, however, “the $1800 tuition
difference (between W&L and Grinnell) is really consid-
ered negligible. It depends on what format one uses to
calculate the total.”

of the W&L student.

“I think students here are a lot hap-
pier than the statistics say,” Murphy
said.

Dean of Students David Howison
said that the retention rate of the last
two graduating classes reached almost
90 percent, which is considerably
higher than the ﬁgures used in the
survey. In future, reports. the satisfac-

tion ranking should increase, he said.

Howison said that in the Princeton
Review, where student satisfaction data
is figured differently, W&L is ranked
as one of the highest.

The U.S. News ranking system re-
lies mostlyon statistical data that quan-
tifies categories such as academic repu-
tation, student selectivity, faculty re-
sources, financial resources, student
satisfaction and freshman statistics. A
survey that asks university officials to
rate other schools in their category is a
small part of formula.

Byusing mostlynumbers, the maga-
zine tries to eliminate subjective evalu-

ation, Litzenburg said.

According to Litzenburg, almost all
of the numbers sent in to the magazine
can be taken right from a financial data
report that is annually filed with the
federal government.

While administrators agree that it is
anhonor tobe listed inthe top 25, some
students are not satisfied with the rank-
mg.

“Everybody we give tours to is just

How many

do you need?

Brotherhood is possibly the most important principle underpin-
ning the social fraternity, as the name implies. The idea is that you
ﬁnd close friends in your fraternity, people with whom you like to
party, hang out, learn and live. Brotherhood is not supposed to be
about division and cliques. ,

A pledge class numbering in the 20s or30s raises serious doubts
about the class’ notion of brotherhood. It’s only natural that in any
group of people division occurs. In a group numbering in the 20s
and higher that effect will be substantially magniﬁed. Rival
subgroups will form. Things will be said behind others’ backs, and
the seeds of deception will have been planted.

Yet fraternities seem so greedy as to be blind to these perils.
Intoxicated with competition, the fraternities have made the goal
of Rush to get the most pledges, with little thought to the chapter’s
future. Everyone wants one year in which the numbers go through
the roof. Why? So that they can take it easy the next year? So that
tliey’ll be talked about all year as the house that got so many
pledges?

Whatever the reason, the welfare of the individual freshman
men is being stearnrolled. They’re being cheated out of the
fraternity experience for the sake of numbers and selﬁshness.
They deserve more than to be one identical element in a throng of
pledge “brothers.”

There is no rule or mechanism in place right now to stop
fraternities from mass pledging. Some fraternities will certainly
argue for a quota system; others will say there are too many
restrictions already. It’s too early to say that one particular change
would be best for the system. But it seems that if fraternities would
take a little responsibility for their futures and the welfare of their
members-to-be, there wouldn’t be any need for a change at all.

Finally, a word to pledges: be cautious in your fraternity
experience. There is no reason your fraternity brothers should not
be your closest friends on campus, but if they are youronly friends,
you have a problem. Don’t limit your horizons. Don’t let the
fraternity become the purpose of your existence. The temptation
to do so will be enormous, but you '11 be letting so much of college
life pass you by.

1941: the year

The dancing and music stopped after Homecoming in 1941. It
would not resume until after the war.

With the U.S. entry into World War II, life at Washington and
Lee changed dramatically. Road trips were abolished to save
gasoline and tires. Football called it a season; they would not play
again until 1946.

W&L men left to ﬁght, many commissioned before they could
receive their diplomas. Many would die, 17 from the class of 1942.

This weekend the members of the class of 1942 will receive the
highest honor W&L can bestow on alumni. They will become
Five-Star Generals.

We applaud the men of the class of 1942 for their brave
representation of Washington and Lee in a somber hour in
America’s history. And for those fortunate enough to be able to
return to W&L today, we welcome you. We hope you find W&L
with traditions and honor in as ﬁne a state as in your day.

LOS ANGELES— In June 1991,
California was in the throes of its an-
nual exercise of mending its budget
imbalance for the foreseeable future. A
Democratic state legislator scoffed at
the idea that the impending tax in-
crease—the largest in the history of
any state—would cause businesses to
ﬂee California.

Oh sure, he said,

is a nuisance for a big corporation with
lots of lawyers, but it is an incentive to
go east—to Tonopah or Tucson—for
the small businesses responsible for 85
percent of new jobs here.

A study by ﬁve California utilities
says that in the last ﬁve years the state
has lost 668 manufacturing plants or

to Tonopah, Ne-
vada.”

Try Tucson. That is where the
Hughes corporation is taking 4,500
jobs. When considering relocation of
its missile-building operation, Hughes
compared Arizona and California re-
garding about 50 factors—taxes, regu-
latory burden, utility rates, labor costs,
housing, etc.—and decided Arizona
was superior in all but two categories.

Big economic battleships like
Hughes (and the Southern Paciﬁc Rail-
road, agribusinesses, Hollywood stu-
dios) built California. Now, however,
they are becoming as marginally im-
portant as, well, battleships. And many
large corporations are innovative only
at the political entrepreneurship of de-
vising alibis for poor performance and
wheedling subsidies from states.

The fact of federalism is iricreas-

example, Wilson has called a special

deal with the fraud-ridden workers’
compensation system.

Originally intended to help workers
injured on the job, it now pays “stress”

lurkedthatother question,
unheard but unavoidable

Why did Richard Nixon’s national security ad-

unreforrnable because of the lavish
campaign contributions from those law-
yers and doctors to career legislators.
“What's wrong with this state,” says
Wilson, “is addressed by term limits.”
Limits were voted for the state legisla-
ture in 1990 but will not bite until 1996.

There has been explosive growth of
social spending. With 1 2percent of the
population, California has 26 percent
of Americans receiving Aid to Fami-
lies with Dependent Children; in 1964
one in six did. This has squeezed out
infrastructure spending. Since 1970 the
miles of highway lanes has increased
by apaltry 15 percent. Intlie 1950s and
1960s, 20 percent of that state budget
went for infrastructure; in the 1980s,
less than 5 percent. The result is mil-
lions of commuters creeping along in
congestion, daydreaming about Ari-
zona. Hence Wilson’s squeeze of
spending on virtually all social pro-
grams.

In 16 of the 24 years from 1967 to
1990 California was governed by Ro-
nald Reagan and his soul mate George
Deiikrnejian.

But in 1991 California got, in Wil-
son, a governor who would do some-
thing not done in 50 years: He made
the 1992 general fund budget get
smaller. A $10.7 billion budget gap
was closed without new taxes.

Of course there may be “trickle down
taxation” as burdens are shifted from
the state to cities and counties that may
raise taxes. But this state, having lost

tion of the Vietnam war

700,000 jobs since May 1990, is think-
ing that its taxes may build Arizona}
economy.

The 1991 tax increase of $7 billion
was, Wilson says emphatically, “a mis-
take.” California conservatives, already
incandescent about George Bush ’s bro-
ken promise on taxes, pronounced
Wilson politically dead. And now the
new budget of a thousand cuts may
offend everyone else. However, the
stricken field of California politics is
littered with the bleached bones of those
who have underestimated Wilson, the
ex-Marine who is determined to gov-
em in Sacramento the way no one will
govern in Washington, where neithé

The nation will get from neither of

Kissinger: The Bobby Fischer otwar

WASHINGTON— Henry Kissinger returned to phy, we can now observe Henry Kissinger’s own
the Senate hearing roorrr this week, bringing with grand master role in this tragic contest.
hirri all the old Vietnam horror. The issue on the table:

to Kissinger’s chessboard vision of the globe. It
explains why a quick Vietnam withdrawal was mi
one of the options presented to the newly-inaugu-
rated Nixon in 1969.

“Henry said it was so far outside what was going
to happen that it didn’t help the options paper, and it

whenever the word “Vietnam” is uttered in the pres-
ence of an American: Why were they sent in the first
place? .-

A generation afterwards, the grim record of that
last great American war remains deep in the collec-
tive American consciousness:

——8 million tons of bombs dropped on Indochina,
four times that used in all the theaters of World War
II;

—924,048 communist soldiers killed, 185,528
South Vietnamese soldiers, 58,022 Americans.

These figures, menacing and incomprehensible
as they are, explain our ﬁxation on the POW ques-
tion. They force us to focus on the Vietnam legacy in
imaginable terms, in the scores of POWs and MIAs
who may have been left behind. An astonishing 20
years later, we find in their lives, desperation and
final tortures the elemental wrong of America’s role
in Vietnam: the subjugation of the individual to the
global chess game.

Thanks to Walter lsaacson’s just-released biogra-

Why did he and Nixon believe the war worth, as
Isaacson writes, “the near unraveling of America’s
social fabric, the poisoning of America’s reputation
abroad (especially among an entire generation of
youth), and the spread of the war to Cambodia and
Laos?”

Why, to put it bluntly, didn’t we leave Viemarn in
1969 instead of four years later?

For Henry Kissinger, the answer was contained in
that lone, illusive catch—word: “credibility.”

“Why not withdraw?” Isaacson quotes French
President Charles de Gaulle asking Kissinger a month
after Nixon’s inauguration.

“A sudden withdrawal might give us a credibility
problem,” he answered.

“Where?” de Gaulle inquired.

Kissinger cited the Middle East.

“How very odd,” de Gaulle answered. “It is pre-
cisely in the Middle East that I thought your enerriies
had a credibility problem.”

Professor Sanders’ comments on
the history and traditions of W&L were,
as always, provocative and stimulat-
ing, and the Honor System Orientation
was especially meaningful, with Pro-
fessor Lamar Cecil ’s eloquent remarks
a highlight. EC President Josh
MacFarland and the Executive Com-
mittee insured that freshmen were not
only attentive but were also made more

sensitive to and appreciative of per-
haps the most cherished tradition of
W&L.

Others too numerous to mention
also contributed to the Freshman Ori-
entation program, and this general note!
must sufﬁce to thank you. I am pleased
that the class of 1996 was the benefi-
ciary of such a community effort!

OPINION

Tradition mingles with chauvinism

. ONE GUY’s OPINION

By Chris Citron
.9

Dear Offended Reader,

In response to your letter the other
week: Does this mean that I can’t call
you “love muffin” anymore? And per-
haps just as important, does this reject
allpotential of having youbemy Home-
iﬁrning date?

Speaking of which, it is that time of
yearagain. Time to get out those Wash-
ington and Lee ties, slowly slipping
them around the necks of your dates
and...oh, did I say that? Terribly sorry.
I truly hope I didn’t offend any fe-
rﬂales, particularly sophomores, who
don’t wear ties. That might be con-
strued as...chauvinistic, would it not?
And I would hate to have any chauvin-
istic tendencies appear in this column
because of my obviously bitter attitude
toward females, particularly sopho-
mores, due to, of course, my romantic
failings with the freshmen of last year.

NO, I could not allow something
like that to occur. It would be inappro-
priate. Instead, I would like to demon-
strate my generous attitude toward the
welfare of feminist ideas, particularly
tmse of the sophomores, in examining
the trulychauvinistic spirit of this week-
end which we are all going to cel-

ebrate.

I am truly offended. One would
think that an institution as fine as Wash-
ington and Lee, although reaped in
tradition, would have the decency to
outlaw such a debasing celebration. I
mean, what is the true goal of Home-
coming? To get drunk. Okay, I'll grant
you that point. But what is the huge
occasion around which Homecoming
is centered? It’s not for alumni, be-
cause they get their own weekend. (It’s
called Alumni Weekend for those who
are confused.) It’s not for the football
team because most everyone leaves at
half-time anyway except for the die-
hard fans.

Of course not. It’s all about the
Homecoming Court; the Show; the
Exhibition. It is the reason we go. It is
the reason for the centerfold spread in
this week’s edition of the Phi. It is the
reason for every conversation concem-
ing women until the Queenis chosen.It
is the essence of the Homecoming cel-
ebration and quite frankly, I’m sick-
ened by it.

Every social organization
nominates a beautiful girl to represent
them in an effort to win the “respect
and admiration” of the entire W & L
community. How can such a crock
continue to exist? Why are all these
girls so beautiful? Why isn’t a rather
obese woman with acne and a really

great personality ever chosen as a nonri-
nation? NO, no one would ever think
to nominate someone of that nature.
Why? Because it’ s deep-rooted in chau-
vinism, dammit!

And what happens once these
beautiful
women

raded? On the football field itself,
dressed as nicely as they can, IN
FRONT OF EVERYONE! Are each
candidate’s qualities read aloud on the
public armouncement system for all to
“respect and admire?” No. It is only

(My favorite last year was “Good na-

Does it get any better than that?) But
more importantly, their faces are plas-
tered in the centerfold of this newspa-
per just adding more hype to the way
she looks! If it were truly about the
integrity of the women, should not
pictures be obsolete?

So I’m a

Homecoming is Homecoming. It’s a
time to celebrate. It’s Homecoming
’92, Once In A Century. Have a tail-
gate. Get drunk. Think about the nomi-
nees instead of your dates. Think about
how you should be there getting “ad-
mired and respected’ ’ instead of some
girl from down the road. Like this
tradition or hate it. It doesn't matter.
It’s meant to let people have fun. So do
it. And get dnrnk. Yell, scream, and
cheer and stay for the whole game.
Good luck fellas.

Dear Mr. Wilson,

of July 13 regarding Professor
Handelrnan’s reducing two students’

ades downward 10-15 points for fail-
' g to use “gender neutr ” language
when turning in assignments for her
Tax Ethics Class.

It is common knowledge that our
educational system is under siege from
“multiculturalism and political cor-
rictrress extremists’ ’ — per my recent

rrespondence to you relative to Pro-
fessors Peck and Hedquist in their
threateningtoorganizeboycotts against
advertisers in the Spectator — a stu-

dent publication supporting itself by
subscriptions and advertisements from
local merchants.

Also, Mr. Wilson,DeanBezanson’s,
the Dean of the Law School, “knuck-
ling under" to the “Accreditation
Commission’s’ ’ refusal to accredit our
Law School unless they barred all
armed services from recnriting on the
school campus — the reason given for
this threat was that our armed services
would not accept lesbians and homo-
sexuals. It's incomprehensible that a
creditable “Accreditation Commis-
sion’ ' would in its wildest dreams mea-
sure the govemment’s decision not to

recruit lesbians and homosexuals in
the armed services as a criteria for
measuring the excellence of any aca-
demic body.

This is a most dangerous situation
and, if allowed to fester and grow,
undoubtedly will create a situation at
Washington and Lee that espouses a
political agenda rather than academic
excellence.

It’s hard to realize that university
level academia does not recognize that
allowing a political persuasion to be
the primary measure of their conduct
and action is insidious poison that will
surely destroy their, and our, most cher-

Alcoholism on campus

By CAMERON HUDDLESTON
Phi Contributing Writer

Alcohol.

It can be the ticket to weekend eu-
phoria, it can become a destructive
habit, and it is one of the most irnpor-
tant problems facing W&L, adminis-
trators say.

“There isn’t a more important topic
on campus. If we could get students
more interested in the [prevention of
abusive drinking], it would make a big
difference,” Associate Dean of Stu-
dents and Counseling Psychologist
Anne Schoer-Lamont said.

In 1990, a survey conducted among
the freshman class revealed that 71

percent of those who responded knew
someone with a drinking problem.

In contrast, 77 percent reported they
could stop drinking after one or two
drinks, but 48 percent felt pressure to
drink.

Sixty-eight percent reported an in-
crease in tolerance, one of the early
signs related to alcoholism.

“I see it in the classroom. People
come into class at eight or nine abso-
lutely reeking of alcohol. There’s deﬁ-
nitely a problem here,” Assistant Pro-
fessor of Spanish Gwyn Campbell said.

Campbell, a recovering alcoholic
herself, said that she has spoken with
four W&L students who had admitted
drinking problem. Schroer-Lamont said
20 - 25 percent of the students she

counsels have an alcohol-related prob-

“The problem at W&L is not so
much alcoholism in the addiction
sense,” said Dr. James Worth, univer-
sity counseling psychologist. “The

ence of alcohol,” Worth said.

Worth said two-thirds of rapes and
assaults occur under the inﬂuence of

When the abuse habit becomes ha-
bitual, the body chemistry alters and a
true craving for alcohol develops, a
person has crossed the boundary into
alcoholism, Worth said.

The momentary sense of euphoria
and relaxation associated with drink-
ing can not compensate for the long-
term negative effects resulting from
alcohol abuse.

The results of abusive drinking come
in many forms. At times, the alcohol
abuser is not the only victim of his or
her actions.

“We know a high percentage of
sexual violence occurs under the inﬂu-

  

the school's so hard and
it relieves stress. That's the
main reason I drink Sunday through
Thursday. On Friday I drink for fun,”
junior Kevin Emerson said.

“I don’t call drinking in college
alcoholism.”Campbell disagrees.“I
think a lot of people who think it’s a
phase are kidding themselves,”
Campbell said. “Alcoholism doesn’t
discriminate. I’m scared for a lot of our
students, not a few, a lot.”

Habitual abusive drinking does not
go unnoticed, especially by the friends
of a problem drinker.

“There’s a time when you need to
face up to it. We should be old enough
and mature enough to tell a friend he
has a problelm,” junior Matt Goodwin
said.

‘No thanks’

Staying sober remains the sole option for some’

By CAMERON HUDDLESTON
Phi Contributing Writer

For a non-drinker at W&L, feel-
ing comfortable in a social scene
centered around alcohol and drink-
ing can be a difﬁcult task.

“At times I wish I drank to get
people off my back. It would
make my life easier,”
sophomore Goose
Garrigus said. Due to
a history of alcohol-
ism in her family,
Garrigus does not
partake in the usual
weekend ritual of
drinking.

“'I'here’re a lot of
alcoholics in my family,
and I’ve seen how it messed
them up,” she said.

The decision not to drink is not
an easy one for her. At times her
peers have questioned her decision
and have placed pressure on her to
drink. “People tell me I’m scared.
They tell me you can control alco-
holism. Usually they're drtmk when
they say it,” Garrigus said.

As a non-drinker, Garrigus has
had the opportunity to observe the
drinking habits of students at par-
ties from a sober standpoint and
has seen a lot of abusive drinking.
In fact, she confronted a friend last

_ year who she thought had devel-

oped an abusive drinking pattern.

“We told the person we were
scared for [him]. We didn't want
the person to hurt [himself]/’ she
said.

Garrigus said the initial con-
frontation was difﬁcult but was
well worth the effort considering
her friend took the advice.

Sophomore Robert Eison says
he recognizes the harmful effects
of alcohol, like Garrigus, and main-
tains sobriety at all times.

“I think alcohol breeds medioc-
rity,” Eison said.

“There’s a substantial number
of students who become mediocre
during the week because of alco-

   
   
   
   

hol,” he said. Eison said he’s been
in classes where he has observed
hungover students or students who
have focused so much attention on
drinking that they have nothing to.
offer intellectually in class.

‘The motto at W&L is study
hard, play hard. People equate play-
ing hard with drinking hard, which

is totally contradictory. Play-
inghard implies beingfo-
cused and enjoying it.’
However, drinking
hard inherently dulls
the senses and in-
hibits physical and
mental capacities,”
Eison said.

So what's wrong
with an occasional“
dulling of the senses?
Eison responded that each
person has the right to make that
decision. Eison has opted to live an
alcohol-free life because “when
you’re drinking, nothing mental is
going on.” '

Also, Eison does not drink in an
effort to avoid the harmful effects
of alcohol. “Why take therisks when
you can take more fulfilling risks?
Put your energy in something use-
ful, something you'll remember,”
he said. O

The decision not to drink was
not a difficult one for Eison, but he
does believeitmightbediffrcultfor
others at W&L. ‘_‘I’m not trying to
be some type of hero, but I'm very
focused and confident about what I
want to get out of life and alcohol 9
isn’tapart of it,” he said. However,
some people were not as comfort-
able with his decision and pushed
him heavily to drink.

“At a party when I’m offered a
drink, I say ‘No thanks,’ and they

say okay and walk off,” Eison said, at

because he does not drink, there is
an elimination of a complete topic
of conversation, which he does not
like.

“It amazes me how much en-
ergy people put into drinking. If
that’s all you look forward to, you .
don’t have much to live for.”

‘A Wﬁhinggvn and Lee Hymn’

“In the shadows of white columns,

When she joined the staff in 1988,

writing a hymn about W&L.

with themes common to Washington

beauty of the school,” Howe said.

Many people on cam-
pus think the Washington
and Lee Hymn should re-
place “College Friend-
ships,” the New York Uni-
versity song that W&L
adopted as its alma mater.

“It is a pretty tune... it
wasn’t a matter of adopt-
ing the song but rather a
matter of it appealing to
the students’ emotions,”
University Historian Pro-
fessor Taylor Sanders
said.

“College Friendships”
may be the ofﬁcial alma
mater, but the Washing-
ton and Lee Hymn is sung
at the conclusion of all
University Chorus and
Chamber concerts, as well
as official school func-
tions.

“I’ll continue to per-
form the hymn,” Spice
said. “But I’ll let someone
else adopt it as the alma
mater.”

The Board of Trustees
must approvechanging the
alma mater, but no one
involved in the creation of
“A Washington and Lee
Hymn” has presented the
song to the board.

Mudslinging dominated policy dis-
cussion as the candidates for Congress
in Virginia’s Sixth District debated in
Lee Chapel Monday.

When not engaged in name-callin g
and accusations, Republican Bob
Goodlatte and Democrat Steve
Musselwhite discussed issues such as
congressional reform, social beneﬁt
programs and political action commit-
tees.

Attacks by each candidate on each
other’s integrity made up the majority
of the debate. During one exchange,
Goodlatte said Musselwhite had lied
about accepting campaign contribu-
tions from labor unions, first denying
and then later acknowledging the con-

During a debate in Lee Chapel Monday night, Republican congres-
sional nominee Bob Goodlatte uses a chart to illustrate what he
called out-of-control government spending.

tributions.

Musselwhite said Goodlatte had re-
ceived contributions from Oliver North.
Musselwhite attempted to defame
North, but applause and cheers from

the audience at the mention of North’s
name drowned him out.

Both candidates stressed the need to
reform Congress by cutting adminis-
trative costs. Goodlatte, a strong pro-
ponent of congressional reform, sug-
gestedcutting congressional staffs and
budgets by 25 percent.

“There is too much bureaucracy in
our government. The excessive num-
ber of committees and subcommittees
in Congress results in exorbitant ad-
ministrative costs,” Goodlatte said.

Goodlatte cited urmecessary perks
and benefits and abuse of the franking
privilege as contributing factors to gov-
ernment overspending.

Musselwhite agreed on the need for
reform and said Congress is absorbed
with passing the blame for America’s
failed economic policy instead of try-
ing to solve it.

In response to a question on how to
improve entitlement programs,
Musselwhite said unemployment was
a major issue facing Congress.
Musselwhite said he favored labor in-

centives and job education training to
put unemployed Americans back to
work.

“We've been giving out ﬁsh. Let's
start giving out fishing poles,”
Musselwhite said. “If a man’s hungry
and you give him a fish, it will feed him
fora day. If you give him a ﬁshing pole
with instructions on how to use it, he’ll
never be hungry again.”

Pointing out ﬂaws in government
health care beneﬁtprograms,Goodlatte
advocated Medicaid reform as a prior-
ity for overhauling social benefit pro-
grams.

He proposed instituting a voucher
system to allow Americans to “shop
for their health care” and thus become
“health care consumers.”

Goodlatte also said he favored wel-
fare reform and was against cuts in
social security.

Both candidates agreed that the
power of PACs to manipulate Con-
gress is undermining public opinion on
most legislative issues.

Musselwhite said PACs are a major

stumbling block in the legislative pro- ‘

cess. He also said PAC campaign con-
tributions have made it tougherjfor
non-incurnbents to get elected.

“For too long, the answers [of how
to raise campaign money] have come
from PACs and lobbyists in [Washing-
ton]. We should limit the amount of
money these groups can give to Con-
gress,” Musselwhite said. .

Goodlatte agreed, saying “95 per-
cent of a congressman’s campaign
funds come from political action com-
mittees.”

During a question-and-answer pe-
riod, a W&L freshman asked about the
candidates’ support of Ross Perppas
the man who “seems to have the ght
ideas.”Goodlatte and Musselwhite both
said they would support the election of
Perot as president if he received the
majority of the popular vote in the
Sixth District.

The debate was sponsored by Ross
Perot’s Virginia petition commit ,
politics honor society Pi Sigma Alpha
and Contact.

Generals

W&L capitalizes on sloppy play by Centre; MacLane rushes for game-high 148 yards .

By SEAN O’RoURiu5
Phi Sports Editor

They say patience is a virtue.

Well, I don’t know how virtuous the Washington and Lee
football team is, but until last weekend, their patience was
wearing thin.

Last year, the Generals went nine straight games without
a win. They salvaged part of the season with a win over the
Georgetown Hoyas in their ﬁnal contest.

At the start of this season, head coach Gary Fallon said
this team was betterthan last year’s and would not repeat the
nine-game drought.

That prediction seemed in serious trouble after the rout

by an especially talented Emory & Henry squad.

But then came the Centre Colonels. Just what the Gener-
als ordered.

The 32-22 victory this past Saturday takes a great deal of
pressure off the coaches and the players. It removes the fear
of a repeat of last season.

“It[the win] deﬁnitely takes alot of the pressure off,” said
junior full back Wilson Moore. “It’s nice to get one under
our belts and get to know what it feels like to get a win.”

A good deal of the pressure during the game was allevi-
ated by Centre themselves.

For the first 30 rrrinutes of play, the Colonels self-
destructed. They made error after error and gave the Gener-
als ample opportunity to take the game over. Which they
did ~

A big problem against Emory & Henry was W&L’s
inability to capitalize on mistakes. They seemed to solve
that problem against Centre.

Fallon believes the team’s ability to capitalize on the
mistakes gave them more and more confidence as the game
went on.

“It plants a real positive seed in their minds. With more
success, they gained more conﬁdence, and conﬁdence is the
biggest part of this game.”

upset Colonels for first victory’

Junior Duane Van Arsdale got the ball rolling with an
interception on Centre’s ﬁrst possession of the game.

The Generals promptly moved to the Colonels’ ten,
where sophomore standout Michael MacLane scampered
over the left side of the line for the ﬁrst score of the game.

On a day that saw almost an inch of rain, it was an
impressive play just for MacLane to be able to cut like he
did.

Centre handed the Generals another gift on their next
series.

W&L’s defense held and the Colonels were forced to
punt. However, Centre’s center snapped the ball ten yards
over the punters head and the Generals took over inside the

A few plays later, sophomore Geren Steiner connected
with classmate William Propst on a ten-yard out for the
generals second score of the afternoon.

Propst did a beautiful job keeping at least one foot in
bounds while getting inside the end zone marker.

“We were able to move the ball well both running and
passing,” said MacLane. “We mixed up the plays and their
defense had to adjust every time.”

Centre’s giving mood continued on their next series of
downs.

W&L’s defense held and again, Centre was forced to
punt. It was an instant replay of the ﬁrst attempt. The ball
ﬂew over the punter’s head and the Generals took over on
the Colonels’ eight.

W&L made quick work of this opportunity. Steiner
found all-American punter, and back-up tight end, Bob
Ehret on a roll-out to his right. The defense forgot about the
6’3’ ’, 205-pound senior and Steiner hit him in the middle of
the end zone.

At the end of the ﬁrst quarter, the Generals had a
commanding 20-0 lead.

“Overall, the team did a nice job,” said Fallon. “The
offense moved the ball around; the defense bent, but didn’t
break; and our special teams played great. They put on nice
rushes on the errant snaps.”

Moore saw the offensive explosion as a combination of

strong play out of the entire offense.

“The line blocked a lot better this week, and
Mac [MacLane] ran a lot harder. Also, Geren[Steiner] read
the defenses better this game.”

Moore was also being modest, because with the loss of
Mark Goglia for the season, Moore had to switch from wide
receiver to full back. Fallon thinks that moved added strength
to the offense.

“We had to move Wilson to full back and he added some
punch to our passing attack,” said Fallon. “Also, since he's
such a big, strong kid, he was to add power to our blocking
and nmning game.”

The lone highlight for Centre was the nmning of their star
freshman, Kris Garrett. Garrett finished with 144 yards on
21 carries. Included in that total was a 44-yard TD run that
was a thing of beauty. He avoided six or seven would-be
tacklers with pure agility and speed. But that was it.

The Generals and Colonels ﬁnished dead-even in total
offense, 281-281, but then again, the Generals didn’t have
far to go to get most of their points.

Steiner had a good game. He had some problems throw-
ing the ball with some zip, but he ﬁnished 11-for-23 for 73
yards, three TD passes, and most importantly, no intercep-
tions. In fact, the Generals did not have any turnovers.

MacLane was the big man on the ground again. He
racked up 148 yards on 25 carries and two touchdowns,
including an incredible 67-yard dash in the third quarter.

Moore added 49 yards as the power back, he also caught
one pass for a TD; Propst hauled in ﬁve passes for 27 yards
and one touchdown.

This week will be a different story, though. Randolph-
Macon pays a visit to Wilson Field to be W&L’s Homecom-
ing opponents.

The Yellow-Jackets pose the same problem to the Gen-
erals Emory & Henry did, they're big and fast. Fallon feels
the team needs to continually improve to beat Randolph-
Macon.

“We can ’t afford to rest. If we want to win more, it means
getting better. Randolph-Macon is a good team and we will
need to play our best to win.”

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

 
   
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

The lack of space given to this
week's sports section has forced the
sports editor to create a summary sec-
tion for most of the fall sports. For all
the coaches out there who are disap-
pointed by this lack of attention, the
sports editor apologizes.

The journey begins with the W&L
water polo team. Head coach Page
Remillard took his young team on the
road to compete in the Virginia State
Championships at Richmond.

The Generals entered the competi-
tion as one of the top favorites, behind
the host Spiders.

W&L got off to a good start by
dispatching Virginia 19-12. It was the
young contingency that propelled the
Generals to victory.

Freshman PatMcKennaledthe scor-
ing with six goals, giving him 17 on the
season. Sophomore Derek DeVries
contributed four, and junior Jacob
Berrnan three in three.

Senior P.J. Waicus kept up his out-
standing play in goal by recording six
saves.

Next up for the Generals was an
overrriatched Hampden-Sydney. W&L
cruised to a 14-2 victory.

Again, Remillard’s young players
stepped in and got the job done. Berrnan
continued his scoring barrage with four
against the Tigers. Sophomore Tony
Diederich added three, while sopho-
more goalie David Silvester ﬁlled in
nicely for Waicus by recording 15 saves
and only allowing the two goals.

This set-up the rematch with Rich-
mond. Two weeks ago the Generals

stopped the Spiders in double over-
time, 1 1 - 10.

This time, Richmond came out on
the winning side. Junior standout Greg
Golub tried as hard as he could to keep
W&L in the game. Golub recorded
four goals inthe game to raisehis team-
lead in the category to 25.

But Richmond just was not going to
be denied this win. The ﬁnal, 16-10.
Despite the numbers, Waicus ended
with eight saves.

Nextup for the Generals is the South-
em Water Polo Tournament to be held
Saturday and Sunday at the Cy
Twombly Pool.

Men's soccer is next on the list.

The Generals have had a difﬁcult
time duplicating last year’s fast start.
'I‘hey’ve run into some tough oppo-
nents, and at times have looked totally
out of synch.

This past week, they played two
games that were like day and night.
First up was Old Dominion Athletic
Conference rival, Guilford.

It was a shoot-out from the opening
tap. W&L scored two goals in the ﬁrst
four minutes. Each time, the Generals
used their heads to score.

Senior Greg Williams took a comer
kick out of the air and placed a perfect
header over the outstretched arms of
Guilford’s keeper.

J uriiorlohn Robinson followed soon
after with another header, this time off
a free kick. Generals led 2-0.

Then the defense began to fall apart.
Guilford scored ﬁve goals the rest of
the ﬁrst half, and added one more in the

W&L is 2-4 entering the contest and is
looking to get back on the winning
track.

The volleyball team is having a
rough time overcoming their lack of
experience and their lack of blocking.
However, they are managing to test a
number of very talented teams.

After coming within mere points of
upsetting defending ODAC champi-

ons Guilford, the Generals traveled to
Tennessee to compete in the Maryville
Tournament. They ended at 1-3.

W&L opened up with a heart-break-
irig loss to Asbury, 15-12 in the fifth.
Senior co-captain Leslie Hess led the
Generals with 15 kills, while freshman
Cheryl Taurassi had 44 assists, two
away from W&L’s single—match
record.

Leslie’s younger sister, Catherine,
ﬁnished with 12 kills, while junior co-
captain Tara Burns had 10.

The Generals went on to beat
Gallaudet three games to none; they
loss their last two: to Thomas More, 3-
0, and Union, 3-0.

W&L ﬁnished their week last night
at Eastern Mennonite College. The
Generals were looking to do against
EMC what they couldn't against
Guilford, beat a top ODAC opponent.

It was not to be as the Generals fell,
15-4, 15-6, 16-14. The loss drops the
Generals to 4-9 with Roanoke College
coming to town on Friday evening.

On the cross country front, it can-
tinues to be the Josephine Schaeffer
story. Schaeffer is two-for-two now
with her win at the Dickinson Invita-
tional.

She ran a personal-best, 18:03,
which was the fastest time recorded on
the Dickinson course since 1987. It
helped propel the Generals to a second
place team fmish.

Freshman Amy Mears and sopho-
more Kim Herring both placed in the
top ten to solidify W&L’s ﬁnish.

Two up-and-comers
jam for Homecoming

By FAITH TRUMAN
Phi Contributing Writer

You may not have heard much about
them before, but this year’s Homecoming
band, Widespread
Panic, is on the way

The night before Widespread Panic’s
concert at the Pavilion they will be per-
forming in Memphis, Tenn.

In 1986, Todd Nance joined John Bell,
Michael Houser and David Schools to form

Widespread Panic.
Their debut album,

to the top, according
to the SAB.

“They are an up-
and-comingbandthat
are about to break in a
huge way all over,”
Student Activities
Board Coordinator
Matt Hansen said.

Opening for
Widespread Panic is

Beach guitarist who
plays with a bass ac-
companist and drum-

Tickets for
tomorrow’s
concert
are $10 at
the door.

“Space Wrangler,”
was released by
Landslide Records in
1988. In 1991, with
the additions of
Domingo Ortiz and
T Lavitz to the band,
Widespread Panic’s
self-titled record
came out on Capri-
corn Records. This
album contains hits
such as “Walkin’
(For Your Love)”
and “C. Brown.” T

mer on the college
circuit throughout the
state.

The two bands do not usually perform
together, Hansen said.

Widespread Panic is based in Athens,
Ga., and is signed underCapricorn Records,
the agency that promotes the popular
Allman Brothers. Hansen said Widespread
Panic has been inﬂuenced by bands such
as the Doors and the Grateful Dead.

Widespread Panic appeared this sum-
mer with “The Horde," a package of bands
including Blues Traveler, Phish and The
Spin Doctors.

Lavitzhassincebeen
replaced by JoJo
Herman.

Widespread Panic was chosen by the
SAB after Hansen coordinated with local
booking and talent agencies.

“We looked for bands that are on a set
tour and will be in the region at the time. It
is one-third of the price this way rather
than requesting a speciﬁc band to per-
form,” Hansen said.

“We like to establish a good rapport
with bands like Widespread Panic. By
showcasing talent before they break, they
will be willing to come back in the future.”

Rivals face off
Saturday on
Wilson Field

By SEAN O‘RoUru<1=.
Phi Sports Editor

Well, it’s that time again.

Autumn is here, it’s football season and
Washington and Lee students are about to
partake in the Homecoming festivities.

It's that once-a-year show when every-
one is glad to see the recently, and not-so-
recently, graduated. A time when the la-
dies amaze with the new fall colors and the
guys impress with the old ones.

Immersed in the heart of this gala week-
end is a football game.

Meaningless for some, indispensable
for others, and, for the rest, merely a side-
show to the half-time activities.

For the players on the field, it’sachance
to impress a captive home crowd. '

This year’s
game features one
of the most heated
rivalries in the Old
Dominion Athletic
Conference, as the
Generals welcome
the Randolph-Ma-
con Yellow Jackets
to Wilson Field.

The rivalry be-
tween the Generals
and the Yellow
Jackets began back on Oct. 17, 1903. W&L
won the first meeting 39-0.

The totals for the last 89 years favor the
Generals, who hold a 20-17-3 edge.

Rando1ph—Macon holds the edge on
W&L since 1980, 5-6-1 . Inthose 12 games,
the Yellow Jackets have outscored the
Generals 256-220.

Some of the games have had huge im-
plications on the Generals’ seasons.

In 1981, the Generals won their first
Old Dominion Athletic Conference title
under Gary Fallon. The Generals went 8-2
that year, 4-1 in the ODAC. Their only loss
in conference play was to Randolph-Ma-
con in a heart-breaker at Day Field, 13-10.

In 1984, the Yellow Jackets crushed the
Generals 49-9. It was one of the worst
defeats W&L has suffered under Fallon.

The Generals got revenge in 1985, heat-
ing Randolph-Macon 31-19. The win pro-
pelled W&L to its second ODAC title
during Fallon’s tenure,

During the past two years, the Yellow
Jackets have won by an average of 27-7.

That does not diminish the intensity of
the rivalry, however. In fact, it only adds
fuel to an already out-of-control ﬁre.

Decorations, parade return
as Homecoming traditions

By CATHY MCCULLOUGH
Special to The Ring-tum Phi

When one thinks of Washington and
Lee, one thinks of traditions such as the
Honor System, the Speaking Tradition,
Mock Convention and Fancy Dress.

But all of these traditions, with the
exception of the Honor System, have
experienced absences from the W&L
campus at some time. Forttmately the
students and faculty did what they could
to revive these customs.

And this year, yet another W&L tradi-
tion will be resurrected: the Homecom-
ing Parade.

Beginning at 11 a.m. on the day of the
Homecoming game, the parade will be-
gin its course at Brewbaker Field, make
its way down Main Street and Washing-
ton Street, and then proceed out Route 60
ending at the Liberty Hall Ruins. All
campus organizations have been invited
to submit a ﬂoat or convertible to partici-
pate in the parade.

Although this year’s parade will have
a different format from the parades of
long ago, organizers hope it will generate
spirit and enthusiasm.

The 1992 Homecoming parade will
combine the ideas of fraternity decora-
tions which began in the 1930s, with the
idea of the students marching through
town before the game, a tradition that
began in the 1940s.

Former Professor of Politics William
Buchanan, who graduated from W&L in
1941, recalls lavishly decorated frater-
nity houses. Chicken wire, colored crepe
paper, and electric lights adorned the
houses.

The night before the game, the stu-
dents gathered in front of Doremus gym-
nasium for a rally, which was followed
by an informal dance.

At this dance the freshmen were re-
quired to wear green bow ties. The color
showed their naiveté and “innocence, and
the bow ties could “designate a freshman
like nothing else” reported the 1934
Homecoming issue of TheRing-tum Phi.

Former Professor of English Sydney
Coulling, '46, remembers the Pajama
Parade. The first year students had to
march from the gym through town carry-
ing torches in their pajamas. In cold
weather, the freshmen had to wear their
coats and ties underneath their sleep
wear.

The parade route took the freshmen
back to Doremus. With their torches, the
freshmen would light a bonfire in front of
the gym. A pep rally then followed.

Once the pep rally came to a close, the
students toppedofftheirevening by crash-
ing the State Theater for a free movie.
The theater received so much business
from the students during the school year
that they allowed this one indulgence.

In the late 1950s, the fraternity deco-
rations and Pajama Parade were still part
of the Homecoming agenda. The fresh-
men not only looked forward to the week-
end to prance through town, but they also
anticipated the football game.

Professor of History Holt Merchant,
’61, said that when he was at W&L the
fate of the Homecoming game was of
particular importance to the freshmen. If
the Generals won, they no longer had to
wear their beanies; they could burn the
hats after the game.

In the late 1960s, some of the other
W&L traditions died out for a while, and
so did those of Homecoming.

The idea of restoring the Homecom-
ing parade arose from the huge success of
the Mock Convention parade in March.
Members of Kathekon, the student alumni
association, have been working with stu-
dents and city officials to organize the
event.

Campus organizations, fraternities and
sororities, the local school bands, fire
departments and even past Homecoming
queens will participate in the parade.

The winner of the ﬂoat competition
will be announced during half-time of the
Homecoming game, along with the

‘Homecoming queen.

The Alumni Office plans to present a
three-foot trophy adorned with a mink at
the base to the winning organization.

HOMECOMIN G

Mink trophy recalls VMI rivalry

By ALISHA JOHNSON
Phi Contributing Writer

Sometimes rummaging through a
dusty Alumni House attic can do strange
things to one’s mind.

Maybe that's not the case with Assis-
tant Alumni Director Rob Mish and
Alumni Staff Associate Matthew Felber,
who ascended the attic’s stairs to find that
perfect “gag” prize for the winner of this
weekend’s Homecoming Parade ﬂoat
competition a moosehead.

Mish said while in search for the
moosehead, he and Felber changed their
minds.

Ideas for potential awards degener-
ated from the moosehead to a “big tacky
trophy” with something “W&L about it.”A stuffed mink
was their ﬁnal idea.

The two-tiered trophy is three feet high and displays a
18-inch stuffed mink wearing a W&L “Class of 20??” T-
shirt.

Nearly 30 W&L organizations plan to participate in the
parade. Each ﬂoat will be judged on how well the creators
demonstrate originality/creativity, design/execution and

 

spirit.

Tom Hooper, president of Kathekon
and grand marshall of the parade will
present the mink trophy to the winning
organization, but it will be on pennanent
display at the Co-op/Bookstore, Mish said.

Each year's Homecoming parade float
competition winners will have their names
engraved on the trophy.

The winning organization will receive
a smaller trophy to keep.

History Professor and University His-
torian Taylor Sanders said the story of the
mink at W&L goes back to the 1830s,
when VMI was founded.

He said Washington College students
would call the cadets “rats” because they
looked “gray and scruffy” in their gray uniforms, and the
VMI cadets nicknamed Washington College students
“minks” because they were “sleek and mean.

”I'he cadets, who had a curfew of about 1 l p.m. on the
weekends, were resentful that Washington College stu-
dents would wait at the gate and pick up the cadets’ dates
when they went in.

“Minks are awful animals,” Matt Felber said, grinning.
“They're called thieves of the night.”

Five-Stars
return and
remember

By KIMBERLY MARco'1'r
Phi Contributing Writer

A pep rally, freshman torch light pa-
jama parade and crashing the State Theatre
are some of the traditions the newest Five-
Star Generals will remember about their
undergraduate Homecomings when they
return to campus this weekend.

This year, members of the class of 1942
will join the distinguished ranks of the
Five-StarGenerals,anhonorheldbya1un1ni
who graduated more than 50 years ago.

Joining the Five-Stars in this year’s
Homecoming activities will be those at-
tending a Cluster Reunion for alumni who
have graduated since 1989. Planned ac-
tivities include a luncheon on the Front
Lawn Friday afternoon, a special Home-
coming seminar given by professors Holt
Merchant and Taylor Sanders, and a recep-
tion to meet the Homecoming queen nomi-
nees at the Alumni House.

For the Five-Stars, this schedule seems
tame when compared to the one they kept
during their undergraduate days.

“It was the bi g—time fall deal,” says
Lauren Wild, ’38, about Homecoming.

The first event of Homecoming week-
ends 50 years ago was a Friday night pep
rally in Doremus. After the pep rally, the
freshmen had to panicipate in a torch light
pajama parade. Former W&L professor
Sidney Coulling, ’48, said, “Since proper
dress was required of Washington and Lee
men at all times, freshmen would put their
pajamas on over their coat and tie.”

Then, with freshman beanies and
torches, they would parade down main
street behind the W&L band. The parade

W&L dances to the Tony Pastor '- v

Orchestra in 1941

always ended at the State Theatre on Nelson
Street, when hundreds of W&L men re-
fused to pay admission and walked into the
theater to see a free show.

“Of course, the show they played for
Homecoming usually wasn’t worth pay-
ing for,” Coulling said.

The next Homecoming event would be
the first of three dances held during the
weekend. The women who were expected
to arrive in Lexington as dates would be
listed in the Homecoming issue of The
Ring-tum Phi by fraternity house. For the
class of ’42’s last undergraduate Home-
coming, the Phi reported, “The Phi Delts
lead the list with thirty-three visiting girls.”

The Homecoming dances were led by a
“ﬁgure,” in which a lady and her escort

 

The Ring-tum Phl, October 1 , 1992

 

were announced, then waited in a pre-
scribed ﬁgure for the announcement of the
other ladies. Friday night was the Sopho-
more Prom.

On Saturday morning, the fraternity
houses would be judged for the decora-
tions they had erected to support the “Big
Blue Eleven,”a.ka. Generals football team.

“No one would ever miss the football
game,” Wild recalled. The attendance of-
ten ran as high as 8,000. The Generals ’ fate
in the Homecoming game was of particu-
lar interest to freshmen, who could toss
their beanies for good if the Blue won.

After the game, it was time to dance
again at the post-game tea dance. Saturday
night brought the Cotillion Club dance,
which featured the announcement of the

Phi Gamma Delta's hospltal
takes thlrd in the 1937 house
decoration contest.

 

winner of the decorations contest.

In 1941, Kappa Sigma took top honors
for their display. The 1941 dance was also
broadcast over the Mutual Broadcast Sys-
tem, and University President Francis P.
Gaines addressed alumni who could not
make it back to Lexington.

The '41 Homecoming was declared the
best yet, a perception sharpened in the
memory of its participants by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Pearl Harbor ad-
dress and the changes it brought.

The class of 1942 lost 17 members to
fighting in World War 11. Many students
were commissioned immediately and did
not return for their diplomas until the mid-
1940s. But return they did, as they will
again this weekend.
