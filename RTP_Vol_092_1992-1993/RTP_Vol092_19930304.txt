Six Phi Delta Theta pledges charged with de-
struction of property after cutting down a bamboo
tree in a VMI professor’s yard have a chance to get
the charges against them dropped.

The six freshmen charged are Ronald Claiborne
Rictards, John Walter Ransom James, Thomas
Lane Bradbury J r., Lester Stuart Borden, Christo-
pher Ryan Connolly and Jonathan Glenn Cof f man.

i The freshmen, who cut down a tree in Professor
John Gordon’s yard, will not have to serve the
maximum penalty of a year in jail or a $2,500 fine.
Instead, they will have to pay $150 for the tree and
each serve 24 hours of community service in

Rockbridge County.

The General District Court has agreed to hold
the destruction of property charge for six months.
At that time, if the students have paid $150 and the
court costs and have completed their community
service, the charges will be dropped.

pavid Natkin, the defendants’ lawyer, recom-

mended the penalty Tuesday.

Natkin presented Lexington General District
Court Judge Joseph E. Hess with a suggestion for
where the men could work off their hours.

“I spoke with Woody Bowyer, who is with the
Community Services Board,” Natkin said. “[He

Sophomore Lindsay "Coleman delights in a hit during a snowball fightthat erupted
on the Colonnade Friday. She temporarily joined forces with freshman Matthew
Mogk, left, and sophomore Taylor Burke. A Thursday storm dumped four to six
inches of white stuff in Rockbridge County.

During a semester as a Fulbright lec-
turer in Moscow, Professor of Journalism
Hampden H. Smith said he could never
be sure if there would be eggs in the egg
store.

“The uneven availability of products
makes life difficult and hard,” Smith said
Thursday in a speech describing his four-
month Russian experience.

Smith said Russian stores carry only
one type of product, and the day-to-day
stock is unpredictable. He said he often
carried a plastic bag with him in case he
found things to buy on the street.

When his son needed sneakers, Smith
said he went to a shoe store with an
Adidas sign in the window. But the store
had only two pairs of shoes, and neither
were Adidas. When Smith finally found a
suitable pair, he said he made the mistake
of not grabbing them immediately.

“I came back in 24 hours to buy the
shoes and the kiosk [where he found
them] was gone,” Smith said.

Smith said the Russians he met were
generous to the point of embarrassing
him. He said they would prepare a feast
for his family even if it meant using their
food supply for the week.

Smith said his students at Moscow
State University were interested in and
awed by his American life. A picture of

his house in America especially made an
impression. ‘

“Nobody made a comment,” he said.
“They just stared at it.”

In Moscow, Smith and his family lived
in a two—room Russian apartment that had
previously housed two families.

Despite the crowded buses, doubling
gas prices and lines of people standing in
ankle-deep snow, Smith said the Russian
people do not miss the Communist sys-
tern.

“They say, ‘We have tasted freedom.’
Don’t think for a minute that they will go
back to what we call ‘the old ways,’ ” he
said.

W&L students get their shot at movie stardom

    

 

Joyce and Natkin said the pledges had already
apologized to the Gordons.

The Gordons reported that their bamboo tree
had been chopped down in mid-January. Sally

Gordon said she and her husband had had problems .

with students on their property before.
.9Joyce wanted the case to serve as an example to
other students.

“Word ought to filter down,” Joyce said. “Mr.
Gordon ’ s property and other private property should
not be the place to get bamboo or anything else.”

In parting, Hess told the men they were part of
a community larger than Washington and Lee.

A ’ “Some things can happen in these situations
that cannot be undone,” Hess said. “[Remember]

that you are part of the whole community, not just

that on top_of the hill.”

usually getting well nigh toasted in the process.

But students aren’t the only folks in town with FD marked on
their calendars. This is a big-business weekend for the long arm of
the law.

The Fancy Dress Committee is issuing fair warning to all
students: Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Board officers will
be out in force for FD. They will be wearing plain clothes, and
they’ll probably even be in line behind you at the FD entrance.

Remember, under Virginia law, it’s not good enough to be 21 to
drink. No one can drink outside, in public.

And ABC and police will be hitting the streets hard. You already

I know that drinking and driving is just stupid, but if that’s not a good

enough reason not to do it, know that the police will be waiting to
play a fun game of one-legged man on the side of the road with you.

And while we ‘re harping on some of the dangers of FD, let’s not
be ignorant of assault.

Don’t think that just because it’s a holiday here at Washington
and Lee, the local criminal element has taken the night off. Steer
clear of dark streets and don’t walk alone. Even a macho guy looks
like an asshole when his head is split open.

And then there’s that more personal kind of assault. For your-
self, remember that a gentleman is a gentleman, a lady is a lady, no
matter how many drinks, and regarding your date, make sure your
expectations of one another are clear.

For everyone’s safety, take a glance at these locations of security
call boxes on campus: the Pavilion, the freshman parking lot, the
end of the stadium, the military science building, duPont Hall, the
Graham-Lees lounge; and new boxes under blue lights: in the
Corral across from Phi Kappa Sigma, in the Piney Woods law
parking lot and on the low brick wall behind the Davidson Park
fraternity houses under construction.

Celebrate the silver screen safely.

Take a stand

Ice-T chastises young people for a lack of moral courage. It’s
pathetic, he says, that he can get paid for standing up and saying
what he believes.

Maybe we should invite Ice-T to speak at Washington and Lee.

A perpetual problem in putting together this newspaper is
getting people to go on the record. Most students we interview

honestlyexpress,agfearthat their opinions» will ‘beread by other

students. .  .

A clear majority of the students interviewed for this week’s
feature on W&L men would not go on the record. We don’t
routinely grant anonymity, except in extraordinary circumstances.
Consequently, there is not much diversity in the opinions ex-
pressed in the story.

But that’s just one example. It happens all the time, in every
section.

This sort of failure in moral courage is exemplified by what
students said in the W&L men feature. Most view W&L as a vortex
that sucks the individuality out of all but the most stalwart. And
those individuals who stand their ground are W&L’s square pegs.

The situation is not helped by a scattering of professors who
discourage independent thinking by giving credit for regurgitation.

It’s all too easy to come to W&L and sail through four years of
being part of the group. After all, it’s difﬁcult to have your own
opinions. Your “friends” might exclude you from the club. Other
students might argue with you. Worst of all, you might have to take
responsibility for your speech and conduct.

It’s embarrassing, though, if there are people out in the “real
world” with W&L degrees on their walls who are afraid to
speak their minds.

Revenue gives government the itch

WASHINGTON -— If only Presi-
dent Taft had not gone golfing at the
Chevy Chase Club in 1909. Perhaps
we would not be saddled with the fed-
eral income

the 1880s there was intense pressure to
reduce tariffs, the largest source of
federal revenue. And because America
was by then an industrial power, it was

not. By Taft's time there were well-
advanced changes — in the
govemment’s revenue base and the
govemment’s appetite for action —
that probably would have produced the
income tax that helps fuel recurring
spurts of government growth of the
sort we are about to experience.

At the Chevy Chase Club, and in
clandestine evening carriage rides (ac-
cording to Nancy Sheperdson, writing
in the March 1989 American Heri-
tage), Taft struck a deal with senators
who wanted to attach to a tariff bill a
constitutional amendment empower-
ing the federal government to levy in-
come taxes.

If the senators would not attach it,

Taft‘ and many" ‘others doubted that it
would be ratified.

Wrong. Pressures for the tax had
been building since the 1890s, which
resembled the 1990s by demonstrating
that “deﬁcits equal deferred taxes.” At
least that is the opinion of Benjamin
Back and Edward Ray, economists at
Ohio State University.

In an essay in “Second Thoughts:
Myths and Morals of U.S. Economic
History,” they note that by the end of

other source of
revenue, were declining. But spending
was increasing, especially for the N av y,
which by 1905 received 20 percent of
the federal budget. And Congress,
acquiring a taste for large social pro-
grams to redistribute income, substan-
tially increased pensions for veterans,
a lobby then as potent as the elderly are
today.

In 1894 the government ran the first
deficit since the Civil War and enacted
a short-lived income tax (it was de-
clared unconstitutional in 1895). In
1913 the Constitution was amended
and Congress enacted another income
tax: 1 percent on income between
$3,000 and $20,000, with a 6 percent

 of "Americans paid anything.

.Then,the'war:carne;' B_y 1919 the top“

rate was 77‘pereent, and taxable in-
come was lowered to $1,000.

The foundation of the modern state
— a mechanism for raising vast rev-
enues —— was in place. The mere exist-
ence of the mechanism altered
America’s political culture by quick-
ening the itch of the political class to
provide benefits to client groups who
were convinced that they would be net
winners from income transfers.

But the postulated relationship that

“deficits equal deferred taxes” is acon-
tingent, not a necessary, relationship.
It is contingent on a particular kind of
political culture, one debased by the
politics of envy (clothed in the lan-
guage of “faimess”) and dominated by
a political class offering an expanding
menu of popular benefits that ostensi-
bly will be paid for by unpopular mi-
norities (“the rich,” “corporations”).
The Clinton

administra-

would be expanded to cover persons
not properly described as displaced:
“If somebody feels that they wan to
improve their living standard, the gov-
emment should do everything that it
can do to help that person. If you quit
jobs and you want to get retrained for a
better job, you ought to get help in that

respect as well.”

entitlements,”

come both a
cause and "an

a culture, on a

Speak! It’s a time-honored tradition -

To the Editor:

SPEAK! Hopefully his word will
be a familiar sight to you after being on
the Hill today. Kathekon members
posted these ﬂyers in order to remind
students of one of the oldest traditions
on the W&L campus—the Speaking
Tradition.

As the student—alumni group, it has
been brought to our attention by retum-
ing alumni that they fear the Speaking
Tradition is dying out in the Washing-
ton and Lee community.

While one alumnus was recently
touring the campus he asked, “What-

1

ever happened to the Speaking Tradi-
tion?”

This time-honored courtesy is one
of the several aspects that makes Wash-
ington and Lee unique from other col-
lege campuses. It creates a pleasant
and familiar environment which is
shared by the students, faculty and citi-
zens of Lexington. For many of us, it
is this particular atmosphere that ini-
tially attracted us to W&L and will
make it difficult for us to leave upon
graduation.

It is believed that the Speaking Tra-
dition, like the Honor System, grew

from the example set by General Lee.
Lee made it a point to know every
student by name, along with his course
load and grades. Only in times when
authority and the status quo were se-
verely questioned, did the Speaking
Tradition risk extinction. During the
Vietnam War, for example, many of
the long standing traditions found their
way out of the lives of the W&L stu-
dents.

Coats and ties, freshman beanies,
and even Fancy Dress were set aside,
as was the orientation of freshmen to
the Speaking Tradition. Fortunately

l

the Speaking Tradition has survived.
through the years thanks to those stu- ~
dents and faculty who chose to pcr- -. I
petuate this custom which General Lee E

felt was so important.

The future of the Speaking Trad?- ",
tion lies in our hands. At a time when -
Washington and Lee is undergoing so 3
many changes, we must actively em-T

brace those customs which have distin-

guished this campus from any other. _
Keep W&L a traditional place 1 ,

SPEAK!

have been partly due to the purchase of “reconditioned” (used)
projectors. Additionally, human error has contributed to the

The Film Society would like to reassure the university
community that every measure is being taken to rectify these
problems; and to that end, we would like to thank Carol Calkins,

inconvenience of the technical problems. These problems have
been very frustrating for the Film Society because they are all
beyond our realm of control.

In the last week, the university has taken actions which
should put an end to the technical problems at the Troubadour.
I would like to thank the university community for its patience,
and to extend an open invitation to join us for upcoming Film

unter S. Thompson, au-

thor, joumalist and inspi-

ration for the character

“Uncle Duke” in the comic

strip “Doonesbury,” is still
alive. Many wonder whether to be im-
pressed or frightened.

E. Jean Carroll wrote Thompson’s
first biography, “The Strange and Sav-
age Life of Hunter S. Thompson.”

“I have heard the biographers of
Harry S. Truman, Catherine the Great,
etc., etc., say they would give anything
if their subjects were alive so they
could ask them some questions. I, on
the other hand, would give anything if
my subject were dead,” wrote Laetitia
Snap, the fictional persona for Carroll.

“I decided to use Tishy [Snap] be-
cause she’s young and she would be
shocked by Hunter,” Carroll said. “I ’m
a jaded old woman, and I’ve known
Hunter way too long to be shocked at
anything he does.”

Snap, a virginal omithologist who
visits Thompson’s Colorado home to
study his peacocks, reveals all of
Thompson’s vices: his drug habits, his
alcoholism, his sexual bravado, his
degenerate person-
ality. lnterspersed
with the story are
quotations from a
vast array of the

bar,” Starkie said.
“He wouldn’tleave
until we were over
an hour late.

“When he got
here, he had to have
a bottle of Scotch,
or something, and
he spoke until he
finished it. He was
incoherent. I was
sitting in themiddle
of the front row and
I got up and left
half-waythrough.”

Starkie is not the
only one with an
uneasy view of
Thompson.

“He was totally
wack-a—doo,”fight
promotor Bob
Arum, a friend of
Thompson’s, told
Carroll. “I never
saw a guy consume frigging drugs like
Hunter.”

Thompson is the author of “Fear
and Loathing in Las Vegas,” “He1l’s

other best sellers.

and sportswriter, met Thompson dur-
ing the Pittsburgh-Minnesota Super
Bowl.

“Ioffered him acoughdrop,”Schaap
said to Carroll. “He said, ‘Oh, thank
you. Here let me give you some acid.’”

“He should have been dead 20 years
ago,” Thompson’s personal physician
told Carroll. Thompson's daily routine
consists largely of Chivas Regal, co-
caine, Durihills cigarettes, and some
acid, marijuana and Halcyon thrown in
for good measure.

“These drugs are gonna get me,”
said Thompson to Rolling Stone in
1980. “All of this shit’s gonna get me,
even those peacocks, and these eighty
speakers, and these fires and these
excesses...and this weed — boy, that’s
good weed. It’s gonna get me some
day, but we don’tknow when, do we?”

The Death Game is a kind of Rotis-
serie Obituary in which participants try
to guess who will die each year. Play-
ers from across the nation pick 60 people
and only score if their deaths are re-
ported in the New York Times obituary
page, and they perennially choose
Thompson.

“When he hits land it will be six feet
under,” Richard Goodwin, a longtime
friend of Thompson, told Carroll. “He’s
immortal. Obviously. Otherwise he
would have died long ago.”

Carroll, who spent two five-day in-
terview sessions as Thompson’s guest,
agrees.

“He’s like a god,” she said. “He’s
untouchable, he’s immortal. When
you’re around him and you’re going

Author reveals the strange and

you’re with him, you know you’re go-
ing to come out on the other side.”

Though Thompson’s lifetstyle gar-
ners mixedreactions, 'I'liompson’s writ-
ing is lauded by critics.

son falls most natu-
rally into place not
with other writers,
but with the great
myths of Western
civilization:
Ulysses, Faust,
Dorian Gray,” said
professor Cybriane
Vonne to Carroll.

Carroll herself
reveres Thompson
as an intellectual.

“He is a genius,
he is a symbol, he is
a myth, a legend, a
god,” she said.
“Some people think
that he is losing his
touch, but he will
always rise.”

In a fax to Will
Hearst on Septem-
ber 1 1, 1987,
Thompson summed up his career goals.

“I need information, I want money
and expenses from the syndication deal,
I must kill pigs — and if I’m going to be

level that we can put up against any-
body else in that nation, I want to be

treated like a wizard and a main player
and the best political columnist in
America or anywhere else,” he said.
Carroll supports Thompson’s ideal. .
“He changed journalism forever; he
is seminal in the history of political
joumalism,” she said. “Nobody Gas
telling the truth about politics until old
Hunter came down the pike,” she said.
“Hunter decided to tell it like he saw
it and he made the rest of political
journalism look like a bunch of pus-
sies. He gave political journalism balls.”
Who is Hunter S. Thompson? Ibr-

haps Carroll's interview with author _

and editor Tim Cahill, a friend of

Thompson’s, describes him most-

broadly.
“Hunterrepresentsfreedom,”Cahill
said. “He has confidence, plus size,
plus a certain undeniable fearlessncss.
“We all have a kind of Peter Pan
ideal in our lives when we're about
twelve. We’re going to do this, we're
going to do that, and it gets beaten out

of us. It gets beaten out of us sometime ‘

between puberty and our first job.

“People often regret the things they
didn't do. Hunter is the alter ego who

Phi Staff Writer

hen asked to describe
the typical Washington
- and Lee man, both
0 males and females
‘ mentioncharacteristics
such as conservative, southern, rich,
. preppy, partier, fraternity member, con-
1 formist, self—centered, or sexist.
“Duckheads, bucks, a button—down
shirt and a shot gun in their closet”
-‘mre the words Mr. W&L himself,
freshman Pat McKenna, used to de-
scribe the stereotypical W&L man.
Ironically, McKenna did not include
himself in this stereotype.
“Although there are plenty of ex-
amples to defy it, there's definitely a
‘ skreotypical W&L man,” junior Sarah
. Drain said.
' Drain attributes the stereotype some-
2 what to the fraternity system, which
I limits men to a small, homogeneous
r group.
- “There's a certain picture of a guy
3 that’ s idealized,” sophomore fraternity
 member Rob Robinson said.
; Robinson believes that a “do-what-
j you-want, worry-about-what-happens-
jlater” attitude prevails among W&L

men, including himself, and is reflected
in their appearance. These traditional
males, Robinson explained, are partly
the result of the fraternity system.

“The fraternity system makes guys
center on tradition,” he said.

The strong fraternity system domi-
nates the social life of most men and
many women, making it
an aspect of the school
impossible to ignore.

Each fraternity tends
to be associated with a
certain stereotype of its
own.

“I think it’s easier to
stereotype the guys than
girls. You classify most
guys by what fraternity
they’ve joined, not nec-
essarily by what they do
academically or athleti-
cally,” McKenna said.

“I think some [fraternities] do pro-
mote the stereotype, and some pride
themselves on that,” junior indepen-
dent Maurice Cole said.

Some students believe that this ste-
reotype is not inherent in many stu-
dents who enter W&L, but is a mindset
that is adopted.

“I think there's definitely a good
amount of molding,” Drain said.

Drain and oth-
ers believe that a
man learn to value
the opinions of the
group more after
being a fraternity
member. However,
some men come to
W&L wanting tobe
a part of the norm,
she said.

“ E v e r y b o d y
comes here indi-
vidualistic. Then
everybody gets into
the same mindset
through pledgeship.

 



Each fraternity tends to be associated with a

FilPhoto I know l’ve con-

formed,” McKenna

 

 

FEATURES

“There’s an attitude that’s conta-
gious,” sophomore fraternity member
Ted Demetri agreed.

While some men find themselves
conforming, there are those who look
down upon the stereotype.

“Whatever stereotype people try to
uphold, good or bad, they’re being
sheltered,” Cole said.

Thefratemitysystem
cannot take all of the
blame for creating ste-
reotypes. W&L women
have helped to perpetu-
ate the typical male im-
age.
‘‘I think that image is
due to both genders. We
came here and saw all
these great-looking
guys, and it’s really ap-
pealing. They see the
stereotypical male here, and it has a
draw,” Drain said.

“That's why we come here, for the
parallel in the student body. I would
not pay this much for a liberal school,”
sophomore Jackie VanVliet said.

Many students said they believe di-
versity will damage long-standing tra-
ditions at W&L, especially the tradi-
tional male. Some believe the present
freshman males have already made a
break with tradition.

 

EF|NlNG THE W&L MALE

Students describe the stereotypical Washington
and Lee man and the inﬂuence of fraternities

may breed lethargy. They get out of the
habit of going after things,” sopho-
more fraternity member Temple Cone
said.

Conesaid heand his fratemitybroth-
ers believe that a new breed of men is
being admitted that does not want to
“suffer” for something worthwhile, in

’ particular, fraternities.

“If they’re not willing to sacrifice
something to get something in return,
what are they going to do after they
graduate?” Cone said.

Although some are wary of change,
others feel W&L will benefit if the
stereotypical male is altered.

“I think the school is becoming pro-
gressively more diverse. Perhaps the
stereotypes will become less accurate,”
junior independent Ben E g gleston said.

“People who are unwilling to deal
with different viewpoints makes them
a weaker person,” Cole said.

Eggleston also shared the opinion
that a specific stereotype should not be
dictated to students.

“I don’t think entering students have
any obligation to have the same inter-
ests as those who come before them,”
Eggleston said.

“I think freshmen men are bucking
the norm, breaking the stereotype,”
Drain said.

“We definitely
have a more diverse
class. Obviously it has
hindered tradition if
22 guys have
dep.ledged,”
McKenna said.

Many upperclass-
men males say tradi-
tions are being com-
promised as the ad-
ministration seeks to
better the reputation
of the school.

his first career home run, also.

The margin held at one until the
Keydet halfof the eighth inning. With
one out, a runner reached base on an
error. Fantuzzi left the game at that
point. The runner eventually came
around to score to make the final 4-2
margin.

The Generals had threatened in the
top half of the eighth. With the score
still 3-2, Hesse and sophomore Duane
Van Arsdale reached with one-out
singles. VMI’s closer then came in to
the douse the flame and added a perfect

ninth for the 4-2 VMI win.

Considering that, last season,
W&L’s 21 losses came by an average
margin of six runs, and only once lost
by as few as two, the 4-2 margin is
highly respectable. Earlier this year,
the Keydets beat the Duke Bluedevils,
who in turn had beaten the Clemson
Tigers. So W&L has much to be en-
couraged about.

“I think we’re pretty good right
now,” Roberts said. “Considering
there’s only one senior and one junior,
we’ll probably just get better.”

Roberts cited the team’s perfor-
mance in Florida during February va-

That’s the way

By SEAN O’RoUR1cE
Phi Sports Editor

Question: who was the winningest
Lexington college basketball team? No,
not W&L’s men's team. No, not VMI.
That’s right, it ,was the W&L women‘s
basketball squad. Though not a true
varsity sport, the women took on some
tough competition the entire season.

Head coach Barry Machado helped
lead the team to a 7-5 mark, with two of
the losses coming to Division I
Davidson, and two others at the hands
of Meredith, the 3rd-ranked team in the
nation for Division 111. Not bad.

The swim teams had arguably the
best seasons of any team. Three men
and two women are headed to nation-

, als. Senior Claire Dudley makes her

fourth appearance at nationals, while
teammate, freshman Rebekah Prince,
makes her first.

For the men, sophomore John Rowe
makes a return trip to the “big dance.”
Joining Rowe will be senior Andrew
Pearson and freshman Craig Sears. The
men also finished the dual meet season
with a perfect 9-0 record.

Lastly, but not least, is the women’s
indoor track team. The team took its
fourth straight unofficial indoorODAC
championship witharecord 157 points.

Leading the way were two stars
who have made major impacts on the
women’s track programs.

Sophomore Sarah Gilbert (our ten-
nis ace reporter) won the long jump

cation as evidence of vast improve-
ment. Last year the Generals were
beaten fairly easily by their southern
foes. This time down, though, W&L
lost each of its four games by one run.
Two of the games went into extra in-
nings. Though they were losses, the
Generals have found a lot of positives.
“This looks like the best team we’ve
had since I’ve been,” said Loizcaux.
W&L is off until next Tuesday,
when they travel to Bridgewater Col-
lege to begin a four-game road trip in
one week. Smith Field has until March
18 to dry up, when the Generals will
welcome Mary Washington College.

it was

and high jump at the meet. She also ran
a leg of the record-setting 4 x 100 relay
team.Her performances in all herevents
earned Gilbert 40-and—a-half points by
herself.

And what women’s track story
would be complete without something
about freshman Josephine Schaeffer.
The cross country phenom made a
smooth transition to the indoor scene.

At the conference meet, Schaeffer
won the 1,500 meter race in 4:54.69,
justthree seconds from anational quali-
fying time.

She then tumed in an excellent per-
formance in the 3,000 meters. Schaeffer
lapped all but the second-place fin-
isher, and finished the race in a record
time of 10:23.88.

Freshman Graig Fantuzzi shined on the mound for the Generals against VMI. Fantuzzi

gave up only 2 earned runs in the 4-2 loss.

Fantuzzi excels as
W&L falls to VMI, 4-2

By Kemr GRANT

The Washington and Lee baseball guide says that
head coach Jeff Stickley may “have found a fountain
of youth right here” at W&L. Fountains he probably
wouldn’t mind. However, the recent snow and rain
has turned Smith Field into the Everglades.

The “Boys of Summer” have been stuck in a
winter/spring weather mix that forced the cancella-
tion of four of the team’s first ﬁve games.

The season was to have opened Saturday in a
double-header with West Virginia Tech, followed
by one game on Sunday. Those were scratched after
last week’s snow storm left the infield good for little
but, perhaps, jungle infantry training.

Wednesday’s afternoon match-up with Holy Cross

“1’m encouraged,” said sophomore infielder
Ryan Roberts. “The pitching really looks good.”

Freshman pitcher Graig Fantuzzi started at
VMI and allowed only 2 earned runs and three
hits over7.1 innings. Those are outstanding num-
bers against anybody, let alone a superior team.
Fantuzzi also struck out five Keydets. ’

“Fantuzzi had a great game,” said the lone
junior General, catcher Chad Loizeaux.

Last year’s Generals’ pitching staff averaged
more than a hit allowed per inning. They also
posted an 8.74 ERA. Thus far, the ’93 staff’s
stands at 2.00.

“Ourpitching is young, buttalented,”Loi7.eaux
said. “We have a lot of depth with the freshman
pitchers.” ’

Did anyone get the license
plate number of the tmck that
just ran over us?

Was that W&L or Virginia?

These were just some of the
questions the Randolph-Macon
men’s lacrosse team was asking
itself after Wednesday
aftemoon’s game against Wash-
ington and Lee.

The Yellow Jackets came to
Lexington——actually Buena
Vista, the game was moved from
Wilson Field to Glen Maury Park
because of the terrible field con-
ditions caused by the weather——
having received some national
recognition from “Lacrosse
Magazine.”

The team felt it could gain a

great deal of national respect if

they could knock off the 15th-
ranked Generals.

Obviously a simple case of
dementia.

The Generals pummeled, beat
on and raked the Yellow Jackets
over the coals—and it only got
worse in the second half. I’ll re-
lieve the tension, 20-4.

W&L was never threatened
as the team jumped out to an
early 8-0 lead.

goals apiece. Senior attacker

noon. A R-MC defender futily chasing a W&L attacker. The end results more often than

with four goals and four assists.

Fellow classmate David
Lefkowitz chipped in four; and
sophomore midfielder Scott
Mackley rounded out the trio with
four.

W&L has now won 14 of the
last 15 Old Dominion Athletic
Conference games.

The Generals get no break,
really, as they have the dubious
distinction of having to play the
Saturday afternoon after Fancy
Dress.

What makes it even more dif-
ficult is the opponent. W&L hosts
13th-ranked Franklin &
Marshall, an important game for

postseason consideration.

had to be canceled due to rain (Holy Cross did not
drive from New York for nothing—they were sched-
uled to play Virginia Military Institute on Thursday).

The Generals, however, did squeeze in their game
versus the neighboring Keydets Tuesday and showed
that Stickley’s fountain of youth may, indeed, be a
treasure. W&L lost, 4-2, to the Division I-AA squad,
but that loss produced far more positives than nega-

tives.

2-0 after one inning, sophomore Bates Brown
connected for his first career homer.

After falling behind 3-1, the Generals closed
to within one run again on a Jon Hesse round-
tripper in the sixth. Hesse is the team’s captain
and the only senior on the 24-man roster. It was

Tennis teams open with
questions and expectations

By SARAH GILBERT
Phi Staff Writer

This spring is looking very
sunny at Washington and Lee,
not only in the weather but also
in the women’s and men’s tennis
teams.

Head coach Cinda Rankin’s
women’s team is ranked 11th in
Division III, and her number one
player, sophomore Marilyn
Baker, is ranked ninth among
other Division III players.

The doubles team of Baker
and freshman Julie Ayers is
ranked 16th, which is quite amaz-
ing considering Ayers has yet to
prove herself during an entire
season.

Not bad for a tennis team that
has only been in existence for
seven years.

“I have high expectations,”
Rankin said. “We have a good
team, and they’re playing well
now. People are enthusiastic and
looking forward.”

Rankin said that the team’s
goal was simply to win the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
championship, which may seem
unusual for a team ranked na-
tionally.

But extenuating circum-
stances have forced Rankin to
reconsider the feasibility of the
team’s original goals.

“Three of my top six players
are going abroad five days be-

fore the conference champion-
ships, and that changes every-
thing,” Rankin said. “So every
team member is critical; it’ll be a
hat trick if we can pull it off.”

Top performances this year
are expected from Baker, junior
captain Kim Dickinson, who
faces a tough challenge as the
number two player; and fresh-
man number three player Shelley
Sunderman.

The Generals’ schedule could
be the toughest of any spring
sport and should tell much about
the level of the team’s talent.
They face five teams which are
ranked in the top 20 nationally,
including Kenyan, who was
ranked first during the fall.

Though the men’s team is not
as highly thought of when it
comes to the national rankings.

JuniorRobbieMacNaughton,
the Generals first singles star, is
again ranked in the top 30 in pre-
season polls, at number 29. He
and another talented freshman
have achieved, like in the
women’s case, a rare pre—season
ranking in doubles.

MacNaughton and Peter
Hammond are ranked 10th in the
doubles pre—season poll.

Head coach Gary Franke is
optimistic about the team’s
chances this season.

“This team’s got a lot of po-
tential, but it’s too early to tell as
to its ability,” he said. “We’re

starting three freshmen, but so
far they’re working hard and do-
ing everything we ask of them.”

Critical for the success of the
team will be MacNaughton; num-
ber two junior Robert Wein,
freshman Chris MacNaughton
(yes, Robbie’s younger brother),
at the number three spot and
Hammond who starts the season
as the Generals’ number four
singles player.

Considering how young this
squad is, Franke’s goals for this
season are tempered with cau-
tion.

‘‘I’d like to have a dual meet
record above .500 and do well in
the conference,” Franke said.
“We have three matches against
teams ranked above us nation-
ally, and if we can beat some of
these teams, hopefully we can
get a team bid to the tourna-
merit.”

Although both teams’ early
matches were postponed because
of weather, the men’s team was
able to get two matches in on
Tuesday. The team split in two
(not literally) and took on James
Madison University and Eastern
Mennonite College. The Gener-
als were able to obtain a split.

J MU defeated the Generals 6-
1, which a new Division I scor-
ing method. The “second team”
easily disposed of ODAC rival
EMC, 7-2. The men are now 1 -1
overall, 1-0_ in the ODAC.

What do the Chicago Bulls, Pittsburgh
Penguins and Duke Blue Devils all have in
common? They have all repeated as champi-
ons of their respective sports.

The Washington and Lee women’s la-
crosse team would very much like to join
that exclusive list.

The Generals won their first Old Domin-
ion Athletic Championship ever last year,
and now they have the chance to join the
exclusive club of repeaters.

But winning the crown the
first time is nothing compared
to holding it the following sea-
son, something head coach
Janine Hathom knows all too
well.

“It is unrealistic to say oth-
erwise,” Hathom said. “Now
that we have actually accom-
plished our goal, we're no
longer a come-from-behinder.
There’ s no sneaking up on any-
one anymore.”

If there was ever a possibil-
ity that W&L could sneak up on someone,
that possibility was shattered yesterday at
Guilford.

Prior to the game, Hathom said she was
not sure how the team would respond to the
pressure of trying to repeat since the Quak-
ers were their first opponents of the 1993
season.

“I don’t know how they’ll respond. We
haven’t played yet,” Hathom said. “But we
haven’t approached anything differently this
season, and what makes it easier is the stu-
dents have willingly accepted the challenge.”

Well, the Generals let the rest of the
country know on Wednesday afternoon that

11th-place ranking in Division III is not
unwarranted.

W&L made the three-plus hour trip to
North Carolina and left a few hours later
with a 20-6 victory.

    

( Ripken

To say this was ugly would have to be the
proverbial understatement of the season.

The Generals entered the half with a
resounding 16-2 edge, and then decided
enough was enough, and played the Quakers
even the rest of the way.

Leading the scoring barrage was sopho-
more stand-outNicole Ripken. The 3rd home/
attack wing racked up six goals in the gener-
als’ overwhelming performance.

Hot on Ripken’s heels was senior co-
captain Lisa Dowling. The scoring machine
tallied five goals of her own, putting her one-
ninth of the way to another record-setting
performance for goals in a
season.

Itisalittleearlytobethink-
ing of that, but I wanted to be
the first to mention it.

The team’s performance
proved Hathorn’s earlier
thought that attack was the
strongest aspect of the squad.

With Dowlrng, Ripken,
Angie Carrington, Pauline
Mita and Lindsay Coleman,
Hathom thinks she has some
of the best players around.

“Our strength is our attack,” Hathom
said, “anyone and all are as good as there is
in the conference. Plus, with Meredith Long,
Cynnie Logan and Cheryl Taurassi we have
depth.”_

Hathom thinks defense is the part of the
team that will have to be worked on the
hardest.

The defense lost one of theanchors of the
unit with the graduation of All-American
honorable mention Whitney Hopkins.

“All the returnees have the talent, they
just have big shoes to fill.

“I have a lot of confidence in Sarah Smith
in goal. She just has to have confidence in
herself,” Hathom said.

The Generals have passed the first of 14
tests that will hopefully lead them back to the
promised land. I-lathorn thinks this team has
what it takes.
