asked him about what the campus and

“We talked about the relations be-

Jennings said. “They were concemed
about whether things look the same
now as they did back then.”

“It’s really critical to not let
programs that have done so much

Atkins said.

Atkins reminded the IFC of
its strong role in the Rockbridge
Christmas basket program. The
program collects food, toys and

needy families.

“I can remember when no one
outside W&L had respect for fra-

Distinguished Civil War historian
and author Shelby Foote gave a rare
speech to a capacity crowd in Lee Chapel
Tuesday night.

Foote revealed some of the theories
behind his unique literary style’ that
made his three—volume series on the
Civil War famous.

“A fact becomes truth only when
you love it,” Foote said. “I love the
Civil War. It is a part of me.”

Foote criticized most modern histo-
rians as being dry as dust. He said many
historians lack the imagination to add
the lifetotheirworksnecessaryto make
them entertaining as well as informa-
tlve.

Foote

Foote said writers should turn their
prose into art by adding emotion to their

works in the same manner as painters
and musicians.

Good historians should make their
works into good literature, he said.

After his speech, Foote answered
questions for more than one hour on
topics from modern literature to the
Civil War, the area in which he is most
famous.

Often referring to the Confederacy
as “we,” the Greenville, Miss., native
said he believes the most important
campaigns of the Civil War were along
the Mississippi River.

Foote said many people in Virginia
believe the most important battles of
the war were fought between Rich-
mond and Washington and thatall other
battles were insignificant. Foote said
he believes the opposite is true.

“Of all the people in the nation who
know the least about the Civil War,
Virginians are the worst,’,’ Foote said,

History needs imagination, emotion

drawing laughter from the audience.

Foote said he avoids naming favor-
ite or most important men or events
from the Civil War. But he said he
believes the war revealed two military
geniuses, U.S. President Abraham Lin-
coln and Confederate General Nathan
Bedford Forrest.

“Lincoln was the only one on the
Union side who had precise ideas on
what the war meant and how it should
be fought,” Foote said.

Forrest, he said, was a natural sol-
dier who could read the mind of his
opponents with deadly accuracy.

Foote spent three days at Washing-
ton and Lee lecturing and speaking to
history classes before he left today.

IFC approves
alcohol mentors

By JUSTIN MCNAULL
Phi Staff Writer

The IFC Tuesday approved a
program to give each fraternity
an in-house alcohol abuse expert,
but training might not start until
spring.

After houses elect new ofﬁc-
ers for spring term, each frater-
nity vice president will attend an
initial ﬁve-hour training session
in the Student Alcohol Mentor
(SAM) program, Interfratemity
Council President Sam Rock said.

University Psychologist
James Worth said he hopes the
program will train a member of
each fraternity and sorority to be
a resource on drug and alcohol
abuse issues. The SAM program
encourages responsible drinking
and decision making.

Worth» spoke to a November
IFC meeting advocating the pro-
gram, which has been imple-
mented by all four sororities.

“If this program would work,
the Hill doesn’t have to put heat
on you,” Worth said. “It will be a
wayto take responsibilty foryour-
selves.”

Worth said the program be-
gan in the University of Virginia
athletic department’s program
and it has expanded to nearly all
of UVa’s 29 fratemities.

The W&L athletic department
joined the program this fall and
Worth said he hopes to begin
training fraternity and sorority
officers as soon as possible.

UVa students, W&L Health
Educator Jan Kaufman and mem-
bers of the athletic department
SAMprogram will probably help
with the first training session,
Worth said.

Worth said he hoped to begin
the program after sorority elec-
tions in January.

He must now determine
whether to start the women’ s pro-
gram in the winter, or wait and
train both groups after fratemi-
ties elect officers at the end of
winter term, he said.

Worth promised that the pro-
gram will be tailored to W&L’s
tradition of student programs
without interference by the ad-
ministration.

“We hope SAMs will be a
valuable resource that will main-
tain itself through its successes,”
Worth said.

Sigma Chi Kevin Batteh, ’95,
voiced support at Tuesday’s
meeting for the way the program
allows fratemities to work out
their own problems.

“Part of brotherhood is to
watch out for one another,” he
said, “and to handle things inter-
nally.”

Cadet dies in crash

From Staff Reports

A VMI cadet and a UVa. stu-
dent died in an auto accident last

Lexington on the morning of
Nov. 26 when he veered into the
path of a cement truck in the
opposing lane.

Gillespie and University of
Virginia junior Heather Altizer,
who was riding in the car, died

at the scene of the accident.

The two students, both 20 and
both ofPounding Mill, Va., were

Mail call?

Neither rain nor snow, nor dark of night will keep the postman from
making his rounds.

Except in Lexington.

Missed issues in magazine subscriptions, letters that take a week to
come from Baltimore, followed by ones that arrive in three days from"
Denver, and letters mailed that never see their destinations: these are the
problems that plague our small-town branch of the U.S. Post Office.

Yet when we lick the back of our stamps, they taste the same as they
do in Charlottesville, Washington and Los Angeles. And they cost as
much.

Phi subscription delivery, which might be described as spotty at best,
drew our attention to the post office scene. After countless complaints of
irregular out-of-town receipt of the Phi, we thoroughly checked our
operation. But the Phis are dropped off with the I.ex post office on a
regular, weekly schedule.

From there, we just don’t know what happens to them.

And neither, it seems, does the post office. We’ve called post office
officials high and low, and everyone denies fault.

If you are a subscriber, and by some miracle you read this paper,
please let us know, speciﬁcally, of any problems in your delivery cycle.
Also, please contact Lexington Postmaster Larry Creamer at 703-463-
2822, Mrs. Beard at the Charlottesville post ofﬁce at 804-978-7610, and
your local post office, so they know we’re not making this up.

But call them. Don’t risk 29 cents on letters.

Stocking stuffers

The season of giving is upon us, and my how we have been giving.
Thanks to the generosity of Washington and Lee students and adminis-
trators, the City of Lexington has a shiny, new fire truck to roll down the
newly paved streets decked out with properly secular holiday wreaths.

Alas, in this apparent sea of prosperity, we poor, starving students
can’t afford presents for everyone on our list. But in the spirit of the
season, we will at least present our annual list of what we would like
everyone to have. Or maybe what they really want. Or maybe what they
really need. Or maybe what they really deserve.

We hope they accept our “gifts” with a jolly ho-ho. Or whatever the
Hanukkah bunny says.

President Wilson: a free, ﬂuffy newsletter to replace the Phi

Mrs. Watson: an $8 million china cabinet

Mortality

MY VIEW
By Rick J. Peltz, ’93

It’s always hardtoacceptthatsome-
one has died.

In M.’s casein particular. He was
37, married, with a one-year-old child.
He had plans, and he was going places.
Just where I might be one day. Not
expecting to die.

It’s hard to accept that the living
intelligence that sat in our living room,
with which I carried on a conversation
on more than one occasion, is gone,
extinguished. M. lived, just like I live.
He had memories. He had favorite
things. He liked to laugh and to have
fun. He knew the wet, juicy taste of an
apple when your teeth crunch into it.
He liked to watch television. On the
night he died, he fell asleep watching
television.

And T. She woke up, and her hus-
band didn't.

That night he took off his clothes
and put on his bed clothes. He climbed
under the sheets and felt the smooth-
ness of cotton on bare feet. He propped
up his pillow to watch TV. He probably

forces a student to forget

thought about what he would do the
next day. He probably held T.’s hand
awhile. He probably thought of his
daughter with whom he had played that
night. He closed his eyes, and his mind
drifted off to sleep, to dream, to heal,
just as it did every night, just as I do
every night.

And something happened. Who
knows if his sleeping brain even had a
moment to be alarmed, if his subcon-
scious mind reacted, maybe with vio-
lent dream images, or maybe by jerk-
ing a hand and an arm, demanding
some physical response from the body,
maybe not understanding exactly what
was happening. And then oblivion.

M. grew up. He remembered his
parents. He remembered school. He
made friends. He loved people. He
probably hated some people. He made
jokes. He argued about politics. He
remembered everything withthe amaz-
ing efficiency of the human brain. And
then it was all gone.

T. and everyone will corrifort them-
selves by thinking of the immortal soul,
even if there is no such thing, even if
they wouldn’t otherwise believe in it.
They’lltalkaboutthelife M.had, rather

LETTERS

than the life he didn’t, despite the fact
that all he was is gone now. They’l1 talk
about what he contributed to their lives,
even though they will eventually die
too.

M. didn’tbuildabuilding.He didn’t
write a book. We comfort ourselves by
saying that what he gave to us and to
the world will endure, his spirit, but a
hundred years from now, no one will
remember him. Even his descendants,
his daughter’s cliildren’s children, will
know nothing more about him then
some very old, two-dirnensional pho-
tographs of somebody who eerily re-
sembles uncle so-and-so. Or maybe
not.

All that he was is gone. His chance
to guide humanity is gone. Mine likely
will be one day too. So it will probably
be for everyone I love. There isn't
enough immortality to go around.

Howcanwe possibly deal with that?
How can we deal with that when it’s
thrust in our faces like this? How can
we maintain our will to live?

I guess we forget it. Everyone thinks
about it now. But what am I going to do
when I’m done writing this? I'm going
to go take notes for a history paper,

putting M. and T. out of my mind. And
nextweek, our family will have Thanks-
giving, and we’ll laugh and talk and
divert one another’ s thoughts from Aunt
Renee and M. We'll go so far as to help
each other forget. Even T. will at some
point decide to “go on” with her life,
which is just a euphemism for deliber-
ately forgetting. She’ll backslide some-
times, but she’ll eventually “accept”
what happened and “go on.”

My great grandmother advocates
the same strategy with a more positive
tone. She says we should seize the day.
It’ s anoble sentiment, one I value, to an
extent. Often not to a sufficient extent,

but I try. And at times like this I try all 9

the more, because tragedy reminds me
of it. But isn't this strategy just another
euphemism for deliberatelyforgetting?
Doesn't it essentially say, “Live now,
because the only alternative is to die,
which you’ll have to do one day any-

way”? Isn’t “seize the day” appealing O

for the same reason as a Ziggy cartoon
that encourages us to procrastinate?

I suppose forgetting is all we can
do. I’m going to forget about you, M.
I’m going to put you out of my mind.
Please forgive me.

The Ring-tum Phi
Post Office Box 899
Lexington, Virginia

24450

In the Nov. 5 issue of The Ring-tum Phi, an
editorial was published which was a direct attack on
the VMI Corps of Cadets and the Commandant,
Colonel Mike Bissell.

The editorial began by describing cadets in the
following manner. “Like wives in the Bible, they
seem to be most active before dawn. Fists clenched,
shoulders back, staggering with bloodshot eyes and
smelling of vomit and stale beer, roving bands of
them come to invade late-night Lexington gather-
ings.” The paper further declares that “The cadets
will make adequate officers, but will they also be
gentlemen?”

The article continues by offering descriptions of
recent cadet actions uptown, including several recent
fights. The article was written in a very slanted
maruier, and it does not include adequate explana-
tions of the incidents. Included is the following
description of Col. Bissell. “Bissel’s defense of his
students goes beyond mere blind faith and enters the
realm of blatant stupidity. Bissel’s apparent ‘us against
them’ mentality, which prevents him from punishing
his beloved cadets, only allows them to discard
responsibility for their actions.”

Iwouldliketobegin my response to this commen-
tary by expressing my disappointrnent in The Ring-
tiim Phi for printing this article. Had the piece been
written in a humorous tone, I would understand
picking on cadets, but in a serious article, there is no
excuse for this type of narne-calling and generaliza-
tion.

Secondly, I am disappointed that such a stereo-
type would be applied in a serious journalistic news-
paper. If the Ring-tum Phi had printed stereotypes
about minorities, homosexuals, or any group other
than cadets, I’m sure they could expect quite a
reaction. If The Ring-tum Phi wants to discourage
“W&L students from provoking conﬂict,” then per-

and refrain from uncomplimentary blanket remarks
about cadets.

Personally, I can vouch for the fact that not every
W&L student is an example of good citizenship, or
even pleasant company for that matter. I know a
couple of W&L students who I have long considered
to be the most pompous, self-important, horses’
southsides I have ever met. On the other hand, I have
had the opportunity to meet some really nice indi-
viduals who were friendly and congenial.

Let me use as examples a few of my experiences
in the past year. Last spring, I was invited, along with
several other cadets, to a W&L fraternity party. I had
a great time, met a lot of affable W&L students, and
enjoyed a good band. I was very impressed by the
fraternity and the brothers, and I can say without
reservation that every single one was friendly and
pleasant.

Not that I'm passing any judgment, butl also saw
some W&L students who were completely drunk,
and who were all too eager to relieve themselves
outside and vomit wherever the urge struck them.
That weekend, one of the brothers got arrested two
nights in a row on the same street by the same officer
for being drunk in public. Ironically, this individual
was also one of the students that I enjoyed meeting
and hoped to rim into again some time.

I also had to go to court in Lexington this fall
where I was convicted of speeding. Although I was
the only cadet in the courtroom, there were more
W&L students present than I can count on both
hands. The first one was convicted of public drunk-
enness, drunk driving, and possession of marijuana.
The last one was also convicted of drunk driving.

The point by now should be obvious. First, W&L
students are not a ﬂock of innocent little lambs.
Second, I have not based my opinions of W&L
students on the actions of a few miscreants, and

W&L students were pot smoking, drunk-driving
winos.

As for the accusation that anything prevents Col.
Bissel from “punishing his beloved cadets,” this is
simply not true. I can assure The Ring-tum Phi that

Col. Bissel has no qualms whatsoever about leveling .
serious and harsh punishments on cadets who rim ‘

afoul of the rules either on post or in Lexington. As an
example, I asked the deputy commandant what pen-
alty a cadet would get if he was seen leaving a frat
house after 1 1 p.m. on a weeknight in civilian clothes
while he was not on official leave. Even if the cadet
had a verbal invitation and there was no trouble
whatsoever involved, the cadet would get 20 demer-
its, four months of post confinement, and 80 penalty
tours.

As any cadet can attest, neither 16 weekends spent
at VMI nor 80 hours of marching are anyone’s idea of
a picnic. A cadet who starts a fight can be placed on
report for “conduct unbecoming a cadet," which,
depending on the offense, carries penalties up to
disrriissal. The only reason a cadet might not be
penalized by the Institute is if he has had charges
pressed by the police for the same incident. In this
way, the cadet is not penalized twice for the same
offense.

One point that The Ring-tum Phi failed to address ‘

(or admit) is the fact that most if not all of these fights
seem to have been started by W&L students. (The
researched details of these incidents are outlined on
the front page of the Oct. 13 issue of The VMI Cadet.)
While I won’t defend cadets who start fights at
fraternity houses, I will certainly stand behind those

who defend themselves, and I think the rest of the .

VMI community will agree.

to the students.” I would like to first of
all clarify what went on at the Board of
Trustees meeting three weeks ago in
Atlanta. Following procedure, I gave
an update on the Honor System with
regard to our caseload and the various
honor orientations. I did mention the
fact that there was an Open Hearing
last May. the first in two years. Let me
now say for the record that there was
absolutely no discussion about the spe-
cities of the case nor any attempt to
reinstate the dismissed student, period.
However, following the Open Hear-
inglast May there was some discussion
among some alumni of the University,
as there always is after one of these,
about the Honor System. As a result, a
few letters were written, including one
from the father of the dismissed stu-
dent, an alumnus, to specific members
of the Board, citing what they thought

were problems with the system.

So, prior to the Board meeting, the
Rector of the University, A. Stevens
Miles, wrote me a letter acknowledg-

ing that he had received these letters,
one of which called for a review of the
Honor System by a committee of the
Board of Trustees. His responseto that
idea was as follows:

“In view of the fact that the by-laws
of the university clearly state that re-
sponsibility for the Honor System re-
sides with the students, I believe that it
would be more appropriate for the Ex-
ecutive Committee to conduct the re-
view and decide what changes, if any,
should be made. You may feel free to
call on me if you would like to have any
input from the Board, but the responsi-
bility is yours.”

To me that is a supreme affirmation
of the Board’s commitment to student
control of the Honor System. This feel-
ing was reiterated to me at the Board
meeting in Atlanta. There was no dis-
cussion of the points brought up in any
of the letters, it was simply left up to me
what, if anything, the Executive Com-
mittee should do with them. The min-
utes of the Board meeting and anyone
in attendance will attest to the afore-
mentioned facts.

Had the Phi done any research into

this matter, i.e. talk to those who were
at the meeting, or believed what I had
told them, the facts that I outlined above,
this editorial would never have been
written. It is my opinion that the Phi
owes an apology to the Board of Trust-
ees to whom, because of their commit-
ment to the Honor System, student
autonomy, and the University as a
whole, we are deeply indebted.

Sincerely,
Josh MacFar1and, ’93
President of the Student EC

To the Editor:

In reference to the editorial [Nov.
12] “Leave Honor to the Students”, 1
would simply like to reiterate a few
points. First I want to commend. The
Phi for keeping such a vigilant watch
on a system which seems to be suffer-
ing from the illness ofpolitics. It is only
through awareness that the students of
this school can actively protect a tradi-
tion which has been revered for more
than a century.

Specificallywithregardto lastyear’s

honor trial, it is important to address
certain concerns. A student was
charged, tried and found guilty, not by
some elite, but by a jury of peers.
Representative students of this school
concluded that this student was guilty,
both in closed and open forums. The
issue is no longer one of guilt or inno-
cence. The issue now is the future, or
rather the present of the Honor Code.
To even consider allowing an openly
and judiciously convicted student to
return to W&L is an outrage. It is

tantamount to saying that money and §

influence (and perhaps a relative on the
Board of Trustees) give one license to
extend the boundaries of the Honor
Code. For a community which so cher-
ishes the memory of Lee, and the stan-
dards of honorable conduct, this as-

Student chides humor columnist

To the Editor:

I’m writing in reaction to Tom Hespos’ article, which the
editors of the Phi decided to include in their November 19
issue. First, on a general note, Tom, I know that you're
“Spos" to be funny, but then again the editors of this illustri-
ous newspaper are “Spos” to choose a furmy person to write
these articles, so I guess it's not entirely your fault that you've
been encouraged to make a fool of yourself in print once

every two weeks.

Your inability to write anything humorous, however, was
never enough reason for me to write to the Phi. After all, this
year we’ve become used to humor columnists failing rniser-

ably.

I was finally moved to write because your colunm last
week took tastelessness to a new level of which you were (I
hope) completely unaware when you wrote the ﬁlth. So let

me till you in.

Four years ago, a Washington and Lee student, Ashley
Scarborough, was killed by another student who was driving
drunk. One of the pieces of evidence in the conviction of
Blake Comer involved a “few front-end paint chips” which
were found embedded in Ashley's body.

Stan to get the picture? Evidently, your “Uncle Vito”
never heard of the incident, but I would think that at some

point you had. Yet you decided to write your “humor”

in order.

colunm anyway, suggesting that we should all begin to rim
over VMI cadets with our cars.

Advocating “vehicular homicide” to W&L students is
about as funny as telling jokes about ovens to survivors of
the Holocaust. For their sake, I hope Ashley's parents do
not continue to subscribe to the Phi, but whether they do or
not, I hope you realize that some sort of printed apology is

Two last suggestions, Tom. First, please leave the third-
person references to the sports figures and the politicians.
Second, I’m sure the VMI cadets are really scared of your

Uncle Vito, so don’t worry if a few of them trap you in the

away.

Delt house (oops...sorry Tom) or in a dark alley late at night.
I'm sure if you just mention his name they’l1 back off right

To the editors of the Phi, I send my warmest congratu-

lations. I didn’t think that it was possible for your con-
sciences to ever allow you to print anything more tasteless
than “Erection Man," but you’ve outdone yourselves once
again. Nice job, guys. Keep up the good work.

‘ AIDS project leader questions Phi coverage

_ o the Editor:

I am writing to protest the Phi ‘s lack
f coverage of what I feel is a very
mportant new organization on the

. campus, the AIDS Education

’ oj t. I have been considering writ-
ing this letter for quite some time but I
ve hesitated because I thought it
portant to wait and see if a pattern
eveloped. Unfortunately, it has.

‘ The AIDS Project was founded this

,ear in order to provide education on

rev%ntion and compassion dealing

ith this disease. We have received an
incredibly warm welcome from the
tlinilrersity as a whole, including ad-

. inistration, faculty, staff, students,

. pus groups and local citizens. It
seems the only group that is not willing
to welcome our organization is the
school’s newspaper.

i At the beginning of the year, two
different reporters wrote stories intro-
Gucing the group to the university. Both

'cles were pushed aside at least three
times, often in favor of stories about
quclhsubjects as ﬂowers on the tables at

i

To the Editor:

I wanted to write this letter in hopes of informing
stu ents about the car tax—what it means to them
and hat to do when the tax arrives around Dec. 1.

The Virginia state law basically states that resi-
dents shall register their cars and pay taxes on them
if they are garaged in the city for a majority of the

ear. (If you pay a car tax at home, however, you do

not have to pay Lexington’s tax.)

Since the students have not volunteered to regis-

ter Qieir cars with the city, the Commissioner of
evenue has been told to get the necessary iriforma-
tion any way she can. Dec. 1 many of us (and our
parents) will be receiving a bill in the mail ordering

usto pay this tax.

VMI. All the while, the editors of the
paper insisted that the articles on the
AIDS Project were bumped for more
important news stories.

Finally, in October, Amy Yarcich, a
reporter for the Phi and an active par-
ticipant in the AIDS Project, convinced
the editors thatastory about the group's
trip to the AIDS Quilt in Washington,
D.C. would be a good idea. I thought
that, at last, this pattern of ignoring our
group was over. I was wrong. Last
Tuesday [Nov. 10], the AIDS Project
hosted its first speaker, Dr. Bob Carrere,
’72. To my knowledge, the Phi did not
even bother to send a reporter to cover
the lecture despite two of the editors
being personally rerriinded as well as
receiving a copy of the press release
issued by the News Office. Instead, the
editors chose to coverone of two events
that occurred last Wednesday night
[Nov. 11]—Dr.Wilson’squestion-arid-
answer session on the mission state-
ment, which was only attended by 35
people. The AIDS Project's speaker
was attended by approximately 90

people. While I don’t think coverage
should necessarily be determined by
attendance, I simply do not feel that we
are being treated fairly.

This lack of coverage is unfortunate
for many reasons, but most impor-
tantly because the AIDS Project is serv-
ing such a vital role on this campus.
Our generation is the AIDS Genera-
tion. It is estimated by many experts
that we will be the first group of college
graduates who attend more funerals
than weddings. Indeed, if the Phi had
bothered to cover the lecture last Tues-
day, they would have heard that ac-
cording to the Centers forDisease Con-
trol, college age people are among the
groups at highest risk of contracting
AIDS. Others in this high-risk group
include: heterosexuals, women, and
Southerners.

Our campus must begin to meet its
responsibilities in educating and deal-
ing with this disease. Anyone who be-
lieves that just because no one has
tested HIV positive at the irifirmary,
that there are no I-IIV positive students

on this campus is a fool. Anyone who
says that if we are going to have an
AIDS Project we should have a Cancer
Project and a Heart Project is being
petty. These other diseases are not
nearly as preventable as AIDS, and
they certainly do not provoke the kind
of hatred and bigotry that AIDS often
does. The thing that has impressed me
the most about starting this group is
that something I had only dreamed of
happening has happened, the entire
community is voicing support for what
we are doing, there are no political or
religious lines being drawn, I have not
received any threatening phone calls,
and some of the most unlikely people
are approaching me on the Colomiade
and asking what they can do to help.
We at Washington and Lee should be
proud of this, and we should be able to
read about it in our school newspaper.

Sincerely yours,

I - Archivist praises law correspondent, corrects error

To the Editor:
, As a member of the Law School
‘community, I applaud the inclusion of
a Law School writer on The Ring-tum
Phi staff. Such a move can only serve to
imiﬁove relations on either side of the
bridge.
As archivist of the Law School,
‘however, I must make one correction
onceming the article onthe MootCourt
ornpetition. In her otherwise ﬁne ar-
'cle, J .D. Lowry misidentified John
W.Davis as “a W&L law professor in

the 1950s." She was off by more than
half a century.

Davis graduated from the College
of Washington and Lee 100 years ago
in 1892. He took his degree from the
School of Law in 1895. He taught at the
Law School for only the following year
(1896-97).

While it is true that he is best known
nationally for arguingthe “wrong” side
of Brown vs. Board of Education, I
hope the impression was not left that

petition bears his name. Davis argued
141 cases before the Supreme Court
competition (only two others—one of
them being Daniel Webster—had ar-
gued more), was solicitor general of
the United States, turned down a U.S.
Supreme Court nomination, was a presi-
dential candidate, and was Ambassa-
dor to the Court of Saint James, to hit
only some of the highlights of his long
career.

He was not, as Daniel J. Komstein
has put it, “Brandeis’s ideal Peoples’

Attorney.” He is, however, by any
measure one of the most distinguished
graduates of the Law School. It is be-
cause this “most accomplished appel-
late advocate of his era” consistently
stressed the importance of moot court
in legal education, that the John W.
Davis Moot Court Competition bears
his name.

Cal sophomore receives tw0—week suspension for letting it all hang out

By J orca BAUTISTA
Phi Features Editor

s winter draws near, University of Califorr1ia-Ber-
A keley sophomore Andrew Martinez, a professed
nudist, is out in the cold.

“I grew up middle class, but I reject a lot of the
middle-values. I don’t believe in monogamy, and I like to
swear a lot. But since I went nude, it’s like I'm lesser in their
eyes because of who I am,” Martinez told The Maneater,
University of Missouri campus newspaper.

Martinez was recently suspended for two weeks after he
defied the chanoellor’s proclamation of no nudity on cam-
pus.

Berkeley sophomore Vicki Berg says Martinez then
came nude to his suspension hearing.

“Last year his nudists beliefs were no big thing,” Berg
said, “Suddenly now it is. But people here really don’t make
a big deal about it.” «

Berg said Martinez goes to class, cats on the lawn in front
of Sproul Hall and visits the wide array of vendors on
Telegraph Avenue—all in the nude.

The publicity blitz on Martinez has included appear-
ances on “Montel Williams Show,” “Hard Copy” and “The

Maury Povich Show.”

He has also been mentioned in publications such as
Newsweek.

“It seems like more of a joke for him,” Berg said. “I just
think he likes the publicity.”

Berg said Martinez staged a “nude-in” soon after The
Daily Californian printed an article about his beliefs, the
first major publicity he had received.

He bought time on the steps of Sproul Hall along with
other nudists last month. Martinez, a group of artists known
as X-Plicit Players, and other campus and community
nudists spoke and painted each other.

“Students were really interested but not seriously,” Cal
sophomore Margaret Lee said.

“We live in a sexually repressive culture,” Martinez told
The Maneater. “Some of the other people who participated
in the ‘nude-in’ would beshunned if their families knew.”

“He usually wears a loincloth and a T-shirt or just boxers,
if he wears anything,” editor of The Daily Californian
Virginia Matzek said.

“I’ve seen him wandering the streets of Berkeley wear—
ing only a T-shirt,” Lee said. “People just try not to stare."

The Maneater reported that Martinez was arrested last
month for jogging nude after dark near a freshman dormi-
tory. Before his suspension campus police arrested him

Traveller and Robert E. Lee were

twice for violating a county code that prohibits any person
who “willfully and lewdly exposes his person . . . in any
public place.”

“I think that nudism is right and was made illegal un-
justly,” Martinez said.

Berg doesn't mind Martinez expressing his beliefs.

“He’s pretty hot,” she said.

Some W&L students don’t find Martinez’s actions very
shocking.

“As long as he doesn't violate school rules then it's all
right. It’s his form of expression,” W&L freshman Jon
Branham said.

“I’d be quite impressed if someone came to class nude,"
Branham said. “Too many people at W&L don’t express the

Dean of Students David Howison said if Martinez were
a W&L student he might be violating Lexington law, as well
as W&L policies.

“We have no explicit anti—nude policy but we do have
something to deal with it,” he said.

Howison said if worse comes to worse he would refer
him to the Student Conduct Committee for violation of the
W&L statement of civility.

“You can express yourself,” Howison said, “but do it
within the law.”

“Students used to sign the bone‘

said.

“[The book is] historically accu-

about horses of these people [that make

“Traveller is probably one of the

Fashion
broadens
honzons

‘By KATIE YDEL
Phi Staff Writer

Tonight at 6 p.m., Over the
Garden Wall will present a fash-
ion show to broaden Lexington’s
hﬁrizons. ‘

“I’m introducing to local
people and students what’s going
on in the rest of the world in art,
not in fashion, ” said Elizabeth
vWarren, owner of the Washing-
ton Street shop.

H Warren is producing the show
with Dolores Holmes,who makes
much of the shop’s clothing, and
Ursula Goad, a jewelry maker and
teacher. The show will be held in
the store and will feature poetry
about the clothes, as well as mu-
5%: and food. Warren said that
she’s working on a relaxed atmo-
sphere and maybe some kind of
“ending surprise.”

Over the Garden Wall, which
opened inJuly, carries hand-made
jewelry, Amish baskets, one-of-
zﬁkind clothing, and other art, like
pottery and paintings. Most of the
pieces are made by artists in the
area, in Canada, and even in Eu-
rope.

’ Warren said she thinks Lex-
ington has plenty of room to grow
ﬁtistically.

“I want to bring nice stuff you’d
usually see in a big city,” she said.

Warren has vests and dresses

madefrom antiqueclothand hand-
woven ponchos and sweaters, all
from local artists.
., Warren said she’s found that
hand-painted coats like the ones
in her store are “all the rage” in
Europe.

Through the show Warren
hopes to spark more interest in art
and artistic clothing, not just in

ashion. She said she’s planning a
how that will expose the com-
munity to new things.

“1t’s going to be outrageous!”

The evolution of Heidi

Play chronicles woman’s life

By Jovcrz BAUTISTA
Phi Features Editor

onight marks the second

performance of Lenfest’ s

latest production “The

Heidi Chronicles,” by
Wendy Wassertein.

As reported in Curtain Call,
the Heidi of Miss Wassenien’s
play is 40-year-old professor
Heidi Holland, whom the audi-
ence meets in 1990 as she shows
slides to her art history class at
Columbia University.

One slide triggers a ﬂashback
to a 1965 high school dance.

The Tony Award-winning
play is directed by Washington
and Lee's playwright-in-resi-
dence, Tom Ziegler.

“When I first saw Wendy
Wassertein’s‘ Heidi Chronicles’
in New York a few years ago, I
was delighted to encounter an-

other poor soul who seemed slightly
out of sync with the rollicking turbu-

lence of that time,” Ziegler said

The main Character Of Heidi is the characters of Debbie and Denise,

agrees with Mikita.

“It doesn’t male bash at all,”
Aussiker said. “It’saboutHeidi’s
evolution and what she ﬁnds out
about herself.”

Aussiker is one of several
actors who portray more than
one character.

Sophomore Michael Neal
plays a total of six characters.

Two of the six are homo-
sexuals.

“I didn’thaveaproblern play-
ing gay characters,” Neal said.

play are not stereotypical. They

Neal emphasizes the simi-
larities of women’s plight in so-
ciety with that of homosexuals.

“Equality is an issue for ev-
eryone,” Neal said. “Heidi's
ﬁghting for the right for every-
one to have a place.”

He said the play makes a
point of explaining that just because
women and homosexuals are generally
seen as inferior and different does not

/gégﬂ . because they specialize in college science buildings. ”
‘ 

But Capital Planning Director Frank Parsons said some members of the Board of Trustees objected
to elements of the Payette and Associates’ model. The model shows Howe and Parmly Halls, the two
current science buildings, connected by a new
building with a curved front wall, ﬁve front
columns, and an exterior glass staircase.

“Some [board members] felt it was too
modern,” Parsons said. “There was a little bit
too much glass in a few places.”

Parsons said architects will be meeting
with university officials and science depart-
ment chairmen over the next year to discuss
design ideas. Parsons said the center will not
necessarily look like Payette’s model.

“They haven’t even talked to the depart-
ment heads to see what their needs are,” Par-
sons said. “It’s very premature to say what thy,
building will look like.”

Parsons said the Board of Trustees will
have the ﬁnal decision on how the building
will look. '

“Having five columns is like having a five-
cylinder engine,” Parsons said. “Believe me
it’s going to change.” .

While the physical plans of the science
center are being discussed, the university still
must determine a way to pay for it.

, According to a summary of W&L’s current
capital campaign, $8 million is earmarked for

them. He said other capital projects, such as the proposed student center and renovations to athletic facilities, will‘

be delayed indeﬁnitely until the science center is built. “
Parsons said he believes construction could begin in 1995 if the money becomes available on schedule.

Big men power W&L
during road swing

By JUSTIN MCNAULL
Phi Staff Writer

Streaky shooting forced head coach
Verne Cariﬁeld to play musical guards,
but consistent play by two big men led
the Generals to three wins in a three-
state, ﬁve-game Thanksgiving road trip.

Games I & 2 - Sm Antenie

Washington and Lee dropped the
season opener to Trinity (Tex.) 71-63,
but rebounded with a 56-53 win over
Harnline (Minn.) in the consolation
game of the Trinity Invitational in San
Antonio.

Sophomore Mark Connelly scored
23 points and grabbed 12 rebounds in
two games as he made the all-touma-
ment team. The 6-7 forward made 64
percent of his shots.

Connelly’s play impressed Canfield,
but it didn’t surprise the veteran coach.

“Mark has the potential to be an
excellent big man,” said Canﬁeld.
“You’ll eventually see him shooting
the three-pointer and posting up, but
right now we're concentrating on him
inside.”

Connelly’s height inside helped
open up center Robert Miggins, who
had 20 points and 12 rebounds during
the tournament.

“For his size, he’ s the best rebounder
I’ve had,” said Canfield. “He hits the
boards real hard and takes the ball to
the hole real well.”

Junior guard Matt Newton also
stepped up his play during the touma-
ment, scoring 22 points in only 34
minutes off the bench, hitting all four
of his 3-point shots and playing strong
defense (ﬁve steals).

“Matt has a great capacity to score
quickly,” said Cariﬁeld. “He can come
off the bench and play great defense.”

The Generals needed Newton’s
scoring punch as starting senior guards
Bryan Watkins and Bryan Brading
struggled in San Antonio, shooting an

abysmal 3-for-34. Good games by
freshman Derek Carter (nine points.
vs. Hamline) and sophomore John
Rogers (eight points vs.Trinity) earned
the split, despite the team’s ice cold 37
percent shooting.

More importantly, the Generals got
the ball to the right people at the right
times for the Harnline win. .

- h‘

The Generals showed up at Sewanee
three days later and unloaded, scoring
85 points as ﬁve players reached double
figures.

Watkins came back in a fury, scor-
ing a career-high 26 points on 7-10
shooting, and 9-11 on free throws.

Brading joined the guard resurgence,
shooting well (3-5, 2 3-pointers) and
scoring 10 points, his high for the trip.

Carter added 13 points and five re-
bounds in only 18 minutes of play. The
freshman averaged 6.4 points on 48
percent shooting during the road trip.

Connelly stayed sharp with 12points
and six rebounds before fouling out.

Canfield likes how his team re-
sponded to Sewanee’s challenge.

“This proves we can play at a hos-
tile crowd with some poor ofﬁciating
and stay within our game plan,” he
said. “It’s a great thing to see early in
the season and is a credit to the play-
ers."

Game 4 - Bridgewater, Virginia

The Generals’ 48-point second half
blitz put away Bridgewater, 67-54, as
the W&L ended the day atop the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference stand-
ings (3-l overall, 1-0 ODAC).

A ﬁrst half reminiscent of the Texas
shooting syndrome (30 percent) left
the Generals down 21-19 at the half,
but Watkins and freshman starter Cam
Dyer lit up the Eagles, shooting nearly
70 percent.

Watkins chipped in 14 of his team-
high 17 points in the second half and
Dyer scored all 10 of his in the second
frame.

A 13-2 second half rim put away the
Eagles, picked fourth in the ODAC.

The Generals shot well (5 1 percent)
making seven of 16 tliree-pointers and
made 10 more free throws than
Bridgewater.

Connelly and Miggins threw irinine
points each, as Miggins ripped nine
rebounds. Rogers scored seven points
in only 10 minutes.

For his strong second half against
Bridgewater and his pasting of
Sewanee, Watkins was named ODAC
Player of the Week.

game 5 - yirginia Beaeh

Miggins career-high 20 points and
nine rebounds couldn't carry the Gen-
erals to a win at Virginia Wesleyan, as
only two Generals shot over 33 per-
cent.

This one was decided early as Vir-
ginia Wesleyan blasted W&L 46-28 in
the ﬁrst half and rolled to an 84-68 win.

Miggins made nine of 12 shots and
pulled down five offensiverebounds in
only 25 minutes of play.

Senior Darren Johnson showed a
glimpse of his talent, scoring eight
points (4-7) in only nine minutes.

Watkins had 12points anda season-
high six assists, but missed 11 of his 14
shots.

DECEMBER 3, 1992‘

Hannah and Schaeffer end’ :
record years at nationals _:

By SEAN O~’RoURxE
Phi Sports Editor

With New Year's just around the
comer, it was ironic that the two Wash-
ington and Lee runners competing in
the Division IH National Cross Coun-
try Championships would symbolize
the “out-with-the-old-in-with-the-
new” for the Generals.

Senior Bo Harmah and freshman
Josephine Schaeffer traveled to
Saratoga Springs,N.Y.,to end the 1992
cross country season.

ForHannah,it was his secondtripto
the championships and the ﬁnal race in
an excellent career. Hannah anchored
the Generals this year, finishing first
for W&L in every race.

Hannah said this trip to Nationals
was even more excitingtlianlast year’s.

“It was exciting to make it last year,”
Hannah said, “but this year was more
exciting sincel am a senior andl knew
it was my final race.”

Even though Hannah finished in
56th-place, he ran his best time of the
season, 25:52.

“I ﬁnished higher last year, but the
competition was tougher this year.”

Hannah would be the main story of
the championships for the W&L faith-
ful, but like this entire season, Schaeffer
stole the spotlight.

Schaeffer became the first W&L
woman to earn All-America honors,
finishing 12th with a time of 18:27.

Schaeffer has been the story for the
cross country season since she won her
first collegiate race back in September.

Schaeffer said she was excited to

make the championship meet.
“I was very excited but I didn’t

know what to expect,” Schaeffer said.
“I was pleased with the way Iran, I felt

comfortable the whole race.” ‘ ,_

After all Schaeffer has seen this
year, she encountered something new
in New York. Snow.

“This was not my best raQe,”r

Schaeffer said, “I had never rim in‘
snow before. I’ve deﬁnitely had better,
ones.”

While Hannah departs W&L for the‘-‘
great unknown of the “real world,”
Schaeffer has three more years to im-I
ggove on her already impressive nﬁm-v

rs.

Schaeffer does understand that with

her success this year, the pressure will
be on to do better next season. v
‘‘There’s definitely a lot of pressure 
to improve my times,” Schaeffer said. .
“But I’m going to do whatever it tzﬂies A
to improve.” 4
