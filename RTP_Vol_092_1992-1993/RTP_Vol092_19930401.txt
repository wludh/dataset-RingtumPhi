Students love
new revisions

S By HUI WINN
Phi Staff Writer

All nine proposed constitutional revisions
passed Monday’s student body referendum, with
90 percent of voters approving the amendments.
3 Executive Committee President Josh
MacFarland said the referendum was a landslide
once the Voting Regulations Board eliminated
ballots cast by illiterate students.

“Most students couldn’t even spell the word
‘referendum’, so we decided to eliminate their
votes,” MacFarland said. “Nine of the 10 qualified
ﬁoters thought the amendments were a great idea,
and I declared the referendum valid. That’s not
quite according to constitutional procedures, but

most of the students couldn’t read the constitution I

themselves to figure that out.”

In The Ring-tum Phi office, Executive Editors
Richard Peltz and Cathryn Lopiccolo popped open
Qlittle of the bubbly to celebrate their victory.

“I can’t believe those gullible voters approved
our amendments,” Peltz crowed. .

“Now we can take over the university and
overthrow the student government,” Lopiccolo
said in a very business-like tone.

Under the revisions, Lopiccolo and Peltznamed
giemselves “permanent editors of the student news-
paper, answerable to no human or deity.”

“At last, I have all the power I’ve craved since
arriving at Washington and Lee,” Peltz said. “And
I can even kill myself with work for another 50
years, and no one can stop me!”

IFC Dictator Leroy C. “Buddy” Atkins said he
fsars for the university now that Peltz is in control.

“Everyone knows that he’s completely brain-
washed Miss Lopiccolo, and she’ll do anything he
says," Atkins said. “Now there’s no telling what he
and his little puppet will do.”

A few students expressed concern that the stu-
dent newspaper would be free from the student

overnment and administration.

* “Imagine what would happen to the United
States if President Clinton couldn’t overrule the
decisions of the Washington Post,” senior Frank
Fascist said. “All that truth running around, and no
one to control it. I’m transferring immediately
before I have to read things that I don’t like.”

Survey: students save creativity for sex

By CREE A. TIVE
Phi Staff Writer

A new survey of W&L students
shows that the Generals have some
interesting tactics in the bedroom.

The survey, conducted by the
W&L Health Education Commit-
tee and Associate Dean of Students
for Sexual Issues Anne Schroer,
polled 600 undergraduate students
about their sexual preferences, fa-
vorite positions and turn-on-s.  -

About 85 percent of students
surveyed said they preferred het-
erosexual encounters; 10 percent
said they were usually homosexual;
3 percent said they switched pref-
erences depending on their horo-
scopes and lunar cycles and 2 per-
cent said they would have sex with

anything alive.

“I think the percentages are quite
healthy on our campus,” Schroer
said.“I wasalittle disturbed at how
few students were open—minded
enough to consider other species
for sex partners, but W&L is noto-
rious for its traditional, narrow-
minded sex practices.”

But Schroer said she waspleased
with students’ creativity in the bed-
room.

“These kids are just sexual ge-
niu»ses,’~’~ Schroer «said: -“Why, I
should be taking lessons from some
of them. In fact, I think I may do
just that. After all, I wouldn’t want
my little love-dove to get bored
with me.”

Over 98 percent of students said
that they are sexually active and
had experimented with different

i‘

positions in bed and elsewhere.
Senior Minnie Lovers said she
was glad to see that W&L students

were so open to new ways of doing '

things and each other.

“I thought that my boyfriend
and I were the only ones to ever do
it on the ‘20,000 Leagues Under
the Sea’ ride at Disney World,”
she said, “but I found out that a few
of my fellow students had done it
too."

According to the survey, W&L
students find it very stimulating” to
do the dirty deed whilctraveling in
some kind of vehicle. Cited in the
survey were many sexual experi-
ences involving cars, roller coast-
ers, golf carts and even “one of

‘Foreign

Student’

to bare all

By PORN O. GRAPHY
Phi Staff Writer

“The Foreign Student” is going to
reveal more about Washington and Lee
than anyone had anticipated.

Members of the administration said
Wednesday that the movie, set to be
filmed on the W&L campus in May,
contains full-frontal nudity and mul-
tiple sex scenes, including an orgy in
Lee Chapel.

“I couldn’t tear myself away from
the script,” University Spokesgrinch
Brian Shaw said. “The thought of all
those luscious college women gyratin g
next to Robert E. Lee’s statue excited
me incredibly. Uhm, don’t print that,
okay?”

The university agreed to the shoot-
ing of “The Foreign Student” in Febru-
ary. The movie is very loosely based on
the novel by Phillip Laymo, who at-
tended W&L in the 1950s.

Shaw said the university had no
idea that the movie would be porno-
graphic, but the administration thinks
any publicity will benefit the univer-
sity.
“What better way to attract hor-
monal high school seniors?” Shaw said.
“W&L has a long tradition of great sex,
what with the abundance of ready-and-
willing women from so many colleges.
I think the movie will highlight the
very best the university has to offer.”

A representative from Caligula
Films, which will produce the movie,

said his company took just a few liber-
ties with the movie script.

“Sure, the script’s a little different
than the book,” said Caligula Films
producer Ima Pervert. “But I talked to
Phillip (Laymo), and he told me about
all the things he left out of the novel. He
said print just couldn’t convey the
steamy atmosphere at that time. I think
our film can do it justice.”

Pervert said the 80 W&L students
who applied to be extras in “The For-
eign Student” will figure prominently
in the porn scenes.

“Some of those sorority girls just
screamed sex,” said Pervert. “l’ve in-
vited a few over to my place for screen
tests, and most of them are shaping up
just fine. Of course, we still may have
to do take after take before the men get
it right.”

Students chosen as extras for the
film said they were a little surprised by
how manyoftheirparts would be shown
on screen, but they are looking forward
to the filming.

“Exposure is key to getting a break
in the big league,” Connie Co-opchiek
said. “Ira has been really patient teach-
ing me all the right moves, and I can’t

‘wait to ‘try them out for real. And nei-

ther can my boyfriends.”

“Where else can you get paid $300
aday to moan, ‘Yes, Yes, Robin. Don’t
stop, baby, “I” extra Bob Hormonal said.
“I had those lines memorizedby the
end of Rush my freshman year.”

“The Foreign Student” is scheduled
to be released in December.

EC reveals sex honor violations

' A Star is Born

By WIIATA J OKE
Phi Staff Writer

 

Washington and Lee said goodbyeto one of its highly renowned journal-
ism professors this week. Professor Brian Richardson will join the
Allman Brothers on the last leg of their North American tour.

The Executive Committee came down the
mountain Monday with its proposals for
White Book revisions, developed at the Sky-
lark retreat.

“We’re all in complete agreement over
these revisions,” EC Grand Poobah Josh
MacFarland said. _

“Get away from that microphone,” senior
EC Rep. Susan Moseley said.

“You arrogant swine,” junior EC Rep.
Ashby Hackney said along with Moseley,
before the pair was subdued by other EC
members.

“The retreat was an enormous success,”
MacFarland said. .

Among the revisions proposed by the EC
after the closed meeting at Skylark are the
addition of being an asshole and performing
several sex acts and positions as honor viola-

tions.

But being an asshole while having sex
will be allowed, MacFarland said.

MacFarland said the EC would also add
cunnilingus and fellatio as exemptions to the
Honor System.

“Doggie style is really where the prob-
lems start,” MacFarland said.“We don ’t think
that fits in with the tradition of honor here at
Washington and Lee.”

MacFarland said the EC based their new
violations on recently released memostdating
back to Gen. Robert E. Lee’s tenure at the
university.

ACLU President Andrew Schneider said
he doesn't think the EC has any business in
the bedroom.

“It’s an outrage that the Executive Com-
mittee is discriminating among sexual posi-
tions,” Schneider said. “Under these criteria,
half the people in Lee Chapel for the orgy
would be kicked out on I-IVs.”

Junior EC Rep. Jimmy Kull said the solu-

tion to too many honor violations might be a
multi-sanction honor system.

“We should let students guilty of HVs
work off their penalties with community ser-
vice hours,” Kull said. “You know, a little
doggy style, a few hours of Live Drive.”

EC Secretary and President—elect Bob
Tompkins said a man’s degree of endow-
ment should be taken into consideration un-
der a multi-sanction honor system.

“Some men, you just have to say, ‘wow,’”
Tompkins said. “Sometimes they need dif-
ferent positions to be comfortable.”

EC members said they are uncertain what
next step in the White Book revisions process
should be.

“We could send the revisions to referen-
dum,” MacFarland said, “but students are too
ignorant for that. We’ll probably just decree
the revisions valid.”

He said he knows such a decree would be
unconstitutional, but “the EC can get away
with it, because frankly, students don’t care.”

Schroer-forrnerly—Lamont said she

she immediately flew to Las Vegas for
a quickie divorce from Professor of

    

Administration Larry Lamont.
“Larry’s been a wonderful husband,
but he just isn’t half the man Jeff is,”
Schroer said. “I can’t wait to become
Jeff’s sex slave —-— uh, I mean, wife.”
“Of course I was shocked by Anne's
divorce,” said the jilted Lamont. “ButI

was getting sick of being the woman of ‘

the house. And at least I won’t have to
use gender—neutral language.”

Schroer said she and Futch have
both decided to hyphenate their names
after their marriage.

Futch said he will take charge of
cooking and laundry, while Schroer
has agreed to wear short
skirts and address him as
“Sir.”

The couple will wed
June 4 in Lee Chapel. The
ceremony is open to the
university community.

The wedding will have
an antebellum South
theme.The bride will wear
a pink taffetta hoop skirt.
The groom will be cos-
tumed in a Confederate
uniform. In lieu of gifts,
the soon-to-be-Schroer—Futches ask
that donations be made to the National
Organization for Women.

Boozeland provides excitement for all °

SPY's SPACE
By Beavis

Last weekend, Beavis had the honor
of attending a killer party at Boozeland,
Washington & Lee’s “secret” retreat in
Hilton Head, South Carolina. Every-
one who’s anyone in W&L’s inner
social circle was there: Howison,
Atkins, and Ricardo (that guy that
cleans up the vomit in the dorms). At
this glorious reception, Beavis picked
up many tidbits that he should share
with his readers.

President John Wilson was the life
of the party, showing up in a white tux
with tails and a cummerbund that lit up
and spelled out “BERMUDA” when
you yanked on his tie. After downing
several bourbon and water cocktails,
Wilson ended up passing out under one
of the tables with soon-to-be-married
Anne Schroer, formerly Lamont. Oh,
well. Kids will be kids.

Also making waves at the party was
French Professor Kathy Koberstein,
who lay atop the baby grand piano and
sang a few bars of “Makin’ Whoopee”
in a sexy sequined dress that would
make Michelle Pfieffer jealous. Un-
fortunately, W&L’s Brat Pack, a drink-
ing society headed by self-proclaimed
drinking king “Big” Leroy Atkins,
emerged from a smoke-filled back

room, completely sehnockered and out
for blood. Atkins poured his drink down
the front of Koberstein’s dress and
attempted to grope her breasts, all the
while slurring something about
“women at W&L” and “the beginning
of an error.” Oh, those deans. What a
lively bunch.

Beavis also saw David Howison
hanging’ out amongst the cocktail
weenies with Ricardo. The two dis-
cussed sexual conquests in such a loud
and frank manner, Beavis couldn’thelp
but overhear.

“Why do you think I put my office
right outside the Co-op?” Howison
asked a puzzled Ricardo. “Because
that’s where all the hot sorority babes
hang out. How did you think I got so
much nookie?”

Well, Mister Dean of Students, we
know that once this gets out, those ‘hot
sorority babes’ won’t be counting ceil-
ing tiles for you any longer.

Gerry “Warbucks” Lenfest made
an excellent speech right after the 15th
round of cocktails. Lenfest announced
he would donate the money necessary
to build a new football stadium.

Now that W&L has gone Division
I,’’ Lenfest said, .“it will need a new
football stadium. I pla.n to donate $156
million.”

University Treasurer Larry
Broomall immediately went into shock,

A very confidential source says that
none other than our favorite French
Professor Kathy J o Koberstein was seen
dancing the night away at the moose
lodge with none other than President
John Delane Wilson. The very same
source says that Mrs. Ann Wilson was
no where to be seen.

Dean Schoer. All the while he was
crying out that she could not marry
Jefferson and leave him all alone in the
office with Buddy. Apparently
Howison is fearful of Buddy. Could
Buddy be propositioning poor Dean
Howison? Hmm. Maybe that’s why
Buddy enjoys working closely with all
those fine young boys on the IFC.
Schoer ensured Howison that she would
not leave the office and would continue
to protect Howison,

Just five minutes later this reporter
heard none other than Jefferson Davis
Futch Ill telling Frank Parsons that
“Anne is going to quit her job and stay
home and make babies as soon as we’re
married.” Could trouble be on the hori-
zon for'the new loving couple?

Let me tell you Boozeland was the
site of many a bizarre happening this
weekend. Our quiet reserved Dean of
Freshmen and Residence Life Dennis

, Manning was seen dancing on a table

as he stripped off his bow tie. Manning
told everyone at the party that all uni-
versity housing will now be.co-ed in
every room. .
Just five feet away from Manning
was the illustrious trustee Tom Wolfe
doing his impression of Marky Mark.
Wolfe stripped down all the way to his
tighty whities, at which point every
woman in the room, except for myself,
passed out. I have to tell you they did
not pass out because Mr. Wolfe was

 

impressive. No. No. They passed out
from the uncontrollable laughter.

I’ll tell ya, Boozeland was quite an
eventful place. All in all he event was
a smash hit with few glitches. Econom-
ics Professor Mike Smitka did get a
little out of hand with an uzi, but other
than that everything was fine. In fact
everyone had such a great time there
were even some tearful goodbyes.
When everyone was wishing their fa-
vorite new loving couple Anne and
Jefferson some fond farewells, the very
pregnant Art Professor Valerie
Hedquist and the slao pregnant Profes-
sor of English Demaree Peck were
seen hugging crazy little Jefferson and
telling him he “deserved only the best.”
Let me tell you, it was a touching

fessor Douglas Szajda and Professor
Robert Huntley will be featured.
Huntley was told they were interested
in him for his stunning resemblance to
Sean Connery. Huntley was heard say-
ing he hopes this helps him “get some
babes.”

Well, here we are, at that point in the
week where we make wild guesses
about the possibilities of upcoming
gossip. lt’s certainly my favorite part.
I mean who wouldn’t love just pulling
stuff out of thin air?

O—kay, here goes! You’ve all heard
about that titalating Foreign Student
scene to be filmed in the chapel. Well,
extremely, very confidential sources
say that scene will involve several big-
wigs in the university and perhaps even
a city official or two. Shall we make
some guesses?

Well, could you imagine Buddy,
Mayor Derrick, and none other than
Dean of the College John Elrod all
appearing in the buff and showing the
world just how manly they are? No,
neither can I. But surely the wise direc-
tors of the Foreign Student will want to
use the sex appeal drummed from the
GQ article and use some of W&L’s
hunks in their sexiest scene!

Well kids, its time for little ole’ me
to leave you for another week. Don’t
forget, keep your ear to ground and
keep Sally informed and in business!

Hiddy-Ho all, and have a very won-
der week. Love Ya!

The Ring-tum Phi, April 1, 1993

Wilson:

might
think

surprised myself that night.”

Wilson smiles sheepishly as he re-
calls the costumed bash many years
ago, the one Phi Delt refers to as the
“Hell’s Angels Party.”

“I was driving down Main Street
with a few of my colleagues,” he said,
“when I saw an entire horde of Chi O’s
descending on one of the fraternity
ﬁiuses. I said, ‘Hey Johnny Uilrod],
let’s pull over and join in the festivi-
ties!"’

Unfortunately for Wil son, Elrod had
an early-moming dentist appointment
and couldn’t join in the fun. Wilson
forced Elrod to drop him off in front of
Hhi Delt.

“I had a little trouble getting into the
fraternity house,” Wilson said. “The
pledges stopped me at the front door
and asked me if I was on the guest list.
At that point, I told them that unless
they wanted to bag groceries for all of
spring term, they had best get out of my
way.”

Wilson descended into the depths

of the Phi Delt party, downing a six-
pack of Milwaukee's Best before he
even got to the room where the band
was playing.
. “When I finally got into the band
room, I was good and sauced,” Wilson
said. “After my thirteenth beer or so,
this girl approached me. I think her
name was Gina—— you’ll understand if
I can’t remember all of the details.”

From what Wilson does recall, he
agcompanied Gina to one of the bath-
rooms in the fraternity house and had
an “amorous encounter” with her.

It was in this bathroom that Wilson

~ got the idea for Fraternity Renaissance.

~ “It occurred to me, as I was getting
down, that the fraternity house bath-
r _oms were completely inadequate
fgr... well, you know.”

Wilson then decided that the uni-
versity could sponsora renovation plan
for all 16 fraternities.

“Notice that, in all the renovation
plans for the fraternities the bathrooms
have been enlarged to better serve the
n€eds of all who might use them,”
Wilson said.

After his encounter with Gina, Wil-
son remembers very little.

He does recall waking up in one of
the upstairs rooms at Phi Delt with
Gina and three babes licking whipped
chain off of his chest.

“I’ll spare you the details,” our il-
lustrious president said. “But I'll say
this: All four girls left that party com-
pletely satisfied.”

And the dumpster fences‘?

“Forget that pansy-ass stuff,” he
sad. “Did I ever tell you about that
time at Phi Psi when I threw the kegs
down the stairs?”

Lexington will be caught up in celebrity fever again this
weekend while camera crews document Washington &
Lee’s social scene for a new version of a movie classic.

Buttco Films International, a movie company known for
its B-grade greats, will film “Porky’s 8” with 16 camera
crews to record W&L’s recreational activities. Buttco has
assigned one ﬁlm crew for each of W&L’s 16 national
fraternities to film the four—night—a-week social scene.

“Washington & Lee’s social scene is ideal for what we
hope to accomplish,”i',t said Shyster Brown, producer of
“Porky’s 8.” “Tliere’s plenty of nudity, beer and debauch-
ery, which we plan to exploit to the fullest.”

V 4 “ Over 500 students arid,fa_c_ulty came toa casting call in the

,,Uniyersi.ty..Center..on Friday. .Several W&L community

Senior Joshua Manning, cast as a random piece of under-
brush in the film, said he was “so happy to be a part of all
this.”

Wilson in aphone interview. “I think that they are discrimi-
nating against me because I have a little tiger tattoo back
there... like George Schultz.” '

Despite Wilson’s failure to get a role, filming will go on
as scheduled this weekend. Buttco attributed 13 injuries to
members of camera crews Wednesday to “fratemity parties
that turned sour.”

In particular, Goober McFudd, akey grip from Hogdung,
Kentucky, was listed in critical condition this morning at
Stonewall Jackson Hospital.

Witnesses say that McFudd was ﬁlming two people
having sex at the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fratemity house
when a keg of beer, apparently heaved out a second-story
window, hit him in thehead and knocked him unconscious.

“We certainly feel sorry for Goober,” Buttco Spokes-
man Fibber Crappile said in a press conference this mom-
ing. “Unfortunately, our company health plan does not
cover alcohol—related accidents, so Mr. McFudd will be
unable to collect benefits.”

CD&P

The Career Development and
Placement Office says that seniors
had better just forget about getting
real jobs in June and focus on memo-
rizingThe Big Book of 1,000 Mixed
Drinks and scouting out bars in Rich-
mond for positions as stand—in bar-

Survey reveals student sex favorites

those plastic ‘Big Wheel’ contraptions
that everyone had when they were a
kid.”

Schroer was not surprised.

“Even (Professor of History) Jeff
(Futch) and I have done it on a Big
Wheel,” she yawned. “If someone had
done it on a ‘Sit—N—Spin,’ then l might
have been impressed.”

Also cited in the survey were sev-
eral sexual experiences involving food.

“I highly recommend maple syrup
and Reddi-Whip,” said sophomore
Wilma Willing.

Again, Schroer was not impressed.

“Futchy-Poo likes to nib me down
with melted chocolate and eat me up
like a Whatchamacallit bar,” she said.

Futch could not be reached for com-
merit.

According to the survey, 98% of all
respondents had a favorite sexual posi-
tion. The straightforward missionary
position fared rather well, being the
position of choice for 36% of the re-
spondents. .

The missionary position was fol-
lowed by doggie—style, 27%; woman
on top, 14%; woman twisted into a
pretzel, 9%; hanging from the chande-
lier or ceiling fan, 4%; facing the tele-

vision set, 3%; and over the hood of an
automobile, 2%. The remaining 5%
make up positions that cannot be dis-
cussed in a family newspaper.

Fortunately for us, we are not a
family newspaper, so we will report
that a few people in the remaining 5%
prefer a position called ‘the Frog’
wherein the woman somehow kicks
her leg up over her head and... oh,
forget it. It’s too complicated.

Schroer said she highly recommends
the Frog Position and will teach a class
on it next spring term.

“ltwill be called ‘Women’s Studies
251,’” she said. “I'm confident that
we’ll have a full classroom.”

“We just make shit up in the hopes
of being sensational,” he said.

Thompson also said he would like
to guide students in a year—long indi-
vidual studyprojects on different drugs
(legal or otherwise).

“There would be an emphasis on
experimentation,” he said. “No fuckin’
lab rats, man, the real thing.”

He would also like to coordinate a
study abroad program in which stu-
dents can travel around the globe in
search of previously unidentified
hallucinogeons.

“It would be a sort of scavenger
hunt,” he said. “The winner is the one
who is left with the fewest functioning
brain cells.”

Professor Thom pson

Thompson would also like to re-
introduce sex education but on a much
more advanced college level.

“There would be an emphasis on
experimentation,” he said.

Bondage and sado-masochism
would be saved for the unpperdivision
students, he said.

However, there would be a lab fee
not covered in the price of tuition. But
he would be very willing to assist stu-
dents who are struggling at no extra
charge.

“I’m not a whore, for God's sake, I
don’t get paid,” he said.

Biographer E. Jean Carroll said of
Thompson:

“Hell itself could not rival Dr.
Thompson’s struggles to become a

c o m r a d e r i e
among the deans
of the university
that is now absent. ’
“We’d go to Skylark,” he said. ‘‘I
would emphasize experimentation.”
As Dean of Extra—curricular
Activites he would like to also empha-
size the benefits of experimentation of
all kinds among the student body.
“College isn't only a place to réad
books or write papers, but a place to
explore your limits as a person, animal
and/or vegetable,” he said.
However, at the moment lofty
dreams of being a dean must be play
second fiddle to the matters at hand.

“Shit!,” he said. “I can't find my .

goddamn doobage. Where the hell is
my coke. Man, if I had my pistol . . .
Yeah, sure there’s an honor code here!
Okay, who made off with my stash!”

W&L football to be

spiked

inthe

Bermuda Triangle

Flight to be lost because of
spurned ex-groupie of

By MULDOON
WHO?

Disclaimer: If this is not
funny, blame the left side of
my brain.

Warning! Warning! Warning!
(Sorry, my CD player’s skipping.)

This is a warning to the W&L foot-
ball team, DO NOT , It REPEAT, DO
NOT GO TO BERMUDA!

This reporter has learned of an ex-
cruciatingly painful fate awaiting the
team on its trip to Bermuda.

This reporter has learned that the
Bermuda Voodoo High Priestess
Terrasan, who believes “all men should
be born guilty,” has placed a curse on
the football team.

According to a reputable source (I
think it’s the shoeshine man from the
“Police Squad” television show, which
preceded the two “Naked Gun” mov-
ies), High Priestess Terrasan was once
a groupie for head coach Gary Fallon.
But coach told her kindly that he wasn’t
interested. Since that time she has har-
bored a deep resentment for him.

Coach Fallon declined to comment
on the situation saying he had no infor-
mation about the threat, but he added
MissTerrasan and he were just friends.

But this reporter has learned from
the same reputable source that the High
Priestess threat is to be taken seriously.
Just last year, Terrasan got even with
another source of unrequited love. She
put this team in the same situation that
awaits the W&L team. And we've all
seen what has happened with the Dal-
las Mavericks.

According to the reputable source,
the team will be lost in the Bermuda
Triangle. But Terrasan has no plans for
any of the team members to be hurt in
any way. The real danger comes from
the mental abuse the team will have to
endure.

  Coach FaI|on’s

Terrasan has ordained it so the Gen-
erals will have to endure the preachin gs
of Branch Davidian leader David
Koresh, Jimmy Swaggart and a Mus-
lim Fundamentalist to be named later
(sounds like a bunch of players in-
volved in a trade) 24 hours a day and
for the entire 31-day period.

Just for those who have been living
with their heads someplace unnatural,
this rewporter will explain quickly who
these demonic souls are.

David Koresh is new to the group
above, and besides the Muslim Funda-
mentalist to be named later, has been
the focus of national attention. He is
holed up in a military-style compound
in Whako, Texas (pardon me, Waco).
He believes the world is going to end in
a few years.

Hey, dork! If the world was going to
end soon, do you still think this re-
porter would bother with this stupid
article?

Jimmy Swaggart (or Swaggert, I’M
not sure) is the perverse preacher who’s
been arrested for picking up prosti-
tutes_ more time than this reporter has
been shot down trying to pick up a
mannequin.

The Muslim Fundamentalist will
not be unknown until a few hours be-
fore the flight is to be lost. There is a
fight among the various factions over
who will have the honor of driving
Americans nuts.

The results of this torture is un-
known because it affects different
people in different ways. I mean the

Mavericks came out this season think-
ing they were a pro basketball team.

Other victims of Priestess Terrasan

include: the 1972-73 Philadelphia
76’ers, the Columbia University foot-
ball team, the ’62 Mets, the 1976 Tampa
Bay Buccaneers (how old is this
woman?), Hitler, Bennito Mussolini,
the leaders of the Crusades. How many
losers do you need to prove this lady
carries some serious grudges?

University President John Wilson
says he does not see any danger in the
team going on the trip, but he’s glad
he’s takeing a different flight. He feels
Priestess Terrasan’s threat is nothing
more than hot air (careful pot, the
kettle’s not that dark).

But who knows, the curse might
work backwards and the Generals will
go undefeated in 1994 and win the
Division III championship. Stranger
things have happened.

THE DOME IS COMING

By KEG
TSAR (or CZ/1R) ofREID HALL

After the “Storm of the Cen-
tury” (as proclaimed by the Lhi)
wiped out 90 percent of the Gen-
erals’ baseball schedule, Wash-
ington and Lee Athletic Director
Mike Walsh announced the con-
version of Smith Field into a
domed arena, this week.

Walsh, Washington and Lee
President John D. Wilson, and
head baseball coach Jeff Stickley
were in attendance at the press
conference in the Warner Center
to unveil the design. 1

The project is being paid for
by the estate of a 1930s W&L
graduate, W. Laurence Thomas
“Indy” Jones IV, esq. Jones re-
ceived an honor’s degree in Ge-
ology in 1931. He also taught at
W&L part-time through 1934.
Jones, an avid archeologist, has
been missing since 1989, when

EL FIN, 199

HE DOME IS COMING? ’

he was leading a search for the
Lost Art of Creativity in Holly-
wood. It was the last of three
such projects for Jones, only the
first of which proved successful.

The new baseball arena will
displaymanyoftheartifacts from
Jones’s 50 years of expeditions
and will be named, in his honor,
the Jones Gallery of Artifacts
and Baseball. Students -may at-
tend games on an appointment
basis only.

The editors of the Phi pro-
posed that the university install a
retractable dome in order to take
advantage of the freld’s surround-
ing view. Immediately, the Spec-
tator called for a “No” vote.

Following a brief debate, the
university and athletic depart-
ment decided that a retractable
dome would not be feasible. As a
compromise, retractable fences
will be installed, instead. Walsh

thinks that this will be more ben-
eficial to the team.

The playing surface will con-
sistofartificial turf, the firstofits
kind at Washington and Lee.
However, the new surface will
not be installed until the 1995
season. In the meantime, Walsh
said the team will play on the ivy
that fell off of Payne Hall, last
month.

“[The ivy} will be much bet-
ter than that slop that they’re
playing on right now,” he said.

Most of the players were un-
available for comment because
the team is presently attempting
to make up its canceled non-con-
ference games 'at the nearest avail-
able fields which were untouched
by the “Storm of the Century” (as
proclaimed by the Phi). The Gen-
erals’ last reported location was
Okinawa. However, communi-
cations have been cut by a recent

typhoon.

The E did manage to reach
team captain and shortstop Jon
Hesse, for some reason on a
neighboring island, and asked
him whether he preferred grass
or “Astro-turf.”

“I don’t know. I’ve never
smoked Astro-turf,” he replied.

According to Wilson, while
the team is away, Smith Field has
been leased to a production com-
pany filming a TV mini-series
about a foreign student who
french-kisses dead Civil War
veterans. Approximately 36.8
seconds of local footage will ap-
pear in each episode.

In a related story, coach
Stickley announced that English
Professor David Lynch will re-
main at Washington and Lee as
an assistant with the basebal
team. v

“Davey’sjob will be to talk to

the guys between innings and
keep them up for the game,” said
Stickley. “We think, based on his
record, that he’ll be a big inspira-
tion for us all.”

Duane Van “Chip n”’ Arsdale
was reached brieﬂy by phone in
New Zealand, but responded to
all questions with a strange gar-
glin g sound.

The Jones Gallery should be
ready by opening day next year.
In the meantime, the Generals
were supposed to play a three-
game set this weekend with a
Philippines Little League team
of six-footers, but that has been
postponed so the field can be
cleared of the ash from recent
volcanic activity. Stickley, how-
ever, is not concerned about com-
pleting the tearn’s schedule. Im-

A mediately following the press

conference, 26 English majors
showed up requesting a tryout.
