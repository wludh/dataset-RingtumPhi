Open container law made stricter

By DAN ODENWALD
Phi Executive Editor

Open the unofficial Washington and
Lee University handbook and find
Freshman Orientation Week. The defi-
nition reads: 400 alcohol-swilling
youths in search of the eternal buzz
(and perhaps a little lovin’). Every
year, the new crop of W&L kiddies do
their best to out-party their predeces-

sors. The Class of 1999 will undoubt- *

edly follow suit. On August 10 the
Lexington City Council, prompted by
the police department, threw a wrench
into their mission.

lt’s called City Code Section 3-3.

Previously, a police officer would
have to see you drink from an open
alcohol container before he could make
an arrest for violation of Lexington’s
open container laws. In theory, you
could legally be in possession of an
open container as long as you did not
drink from it. Not so, anymore.

Police are now entitled to arrest
someone simply for being in posses-
sion of an open container regardless of
whether he is drinking or not.

The police department urged the
city council to adopt this ordinance in
response to complaints from Lexing-
ton residents that public parks and rec-

reation areas were becoming hot spots
for outdoor drinking.

The law was not specifically de-
signed with students in mind, said Po-
lice Chief Bruce M. Beard. The in-
tended purpose was to curb drinking in
public parks by townspeople during
the summer.

Despite the initial goal of the ordi-
nance, students should take notice.

Beard does not expect the change
will adversely affect students, although
he does caution them to take more care.

“Students should not take alcohol
with them when they leave a party for
another,” Beard said.

Beard also advised the members of

the freshman class to watch the use and
abuse of alcohol. Because most are
probably minors, he urged them to
refrain from drinking altogether.

The most common alcohol-related
offenses forwhich students are arrested
are minor in possession and drunk in
public. Beard was pleased to add that
the number of drunken driving arrests
continues to fall every year.

With the inﬂux of students into Lex-
ington this week, police patrols will be
increased to monitor the “welcome-
back” parties. Beard also warned stu-
dents to be mindful of the increased
police presence on Rush weekends.

“Party smart and safe,” Beard said.

An electronic entry sys-

first time in the freshman
tdorms on Saturday night.

The class of 1999 will be
the first to test the card-ac-
cess system, which may ex-
pand to include academic
buildings.

“We wanted a pet project
to test the system on,” said
Director of Security Mike
Young, “and we thought the
freshman dorms would be a
good place to start.”

Once the system goes
online Saturday night, only
those with Washington and
Lee University cards will be
able to enter the dorms.

the electronic card reader
will disengage the magnetic
force that keeps the door
locked 24 hours a day. Once
a student enters the door, it
shuts and locks behind him

Inside the building, a
motion detector disengages
the lock when a student ap-
proaches, and again shuts
and locks when the student
exits.

Only the doors to-the
buildings will be locked. Hall
doors will not be locked, as
they have been at night in
the past.

Class of 1999
continues tradition
of excellence

By ANNE ALVORD

The graduation of the class of 1999
will coincide with the 250th anniver-
sary of the founding of Washington
and Lee, and they certainly seem to be
worthy of such a distinction.

There will be 434 freshmen, includ-
ing 251 men and 183 women. They
represent 39 states and nine foreign
countries. Virginia (54), Maryland(32),
Georgia (32), New York(29), and Texas
(26) are the most widely represented
states. The foriegn countires repre-
sented are Brazil, Canada, Dominican
Republic, Germany, Jamaica,
Mauritius, Poland, Spain, and Switzer-
land, each with one student. There are
369 secondary schools represented.

There are 48 children of alumni.

Twenty-nine percent of the class
receives need-based financial aid.

The freshmen have among them an
astounding academic and extracurricu-
lar record.

The class of 1999 had an average
class rank of 91%. The average SAT

Sixty-two percent of the freshmen
have completed at least one year of
Calculus, with 69% of the class com-
ing from five or more years of math
background. 96.7% ofthe class has had
three or more years of laboratory sci-
ence background.

The freshmen include IO4 presi-

How to be cool: a survival guide for freshmen

GREEN LAND
Betsy Green

I doubt I’ll be the first person to say this, but
welcome to W&L! So, what’s your name?
Where are you from? I know, I know... you feel
like you’ve been in Lexington for mere minutes
and already you’re overwhelmed. At this time
two years ago, I was frantically trying to cram
all of my belongings into my teeny room,
figuring out how to work my phone, and think-
ing, “Who the hell are all these people?” (Mean-
while, my mom was resting on my newly made
bed, probably enjoyingthose springs that poked
me in the back for the duration of my first year
at school.) So, what should you do? How can
you, to put in simplest terms, be cool? Read on,
little freshmen. I like to tell myself I know all
the elements of a cool freshman year.

‘ Your clothes: You’ve probably already

figured out that W&L looks like the J Crew
catalog exploded on it. Polo shirts, khaki pants,
barn jackets, and roll-neck sweaters abound. If
you want to look like everyone else, grab your

* Your room: You are automatically cool

facts: You are a freshman. You are far away
from your parents. These realities mean that
the first few weeks of your freshman year will

not be described with these words: Decorum.
Moderation. Modesty. Just calm down. You
don’t have to hit every single party every night.
If you have a headache, go home early or
(shudder) don’t go out at all. Relax - there will
be another party soon enough.

You’re probably also wondering: what’s up
with this Rush thing? Guys, I’m sorry, but since
I’m a woman, I don’t have too much advice for
you. It seems effective to go out, have fun, and
not vomit on anyone you’re trying to impress.
But I could be wrong. Women: Take advantage
of all the band parties and free drinks. Stay clear
of all the male bonding— you don’t want to get
in the middle of that. You may have also no-
ticed that Rush is an odd time for romance. The
men are more interested in each other than in
you (in a fraternal way, of course). This will
pass...to some extent. Which brings me to our
next concern.

* Romance: Romance? What’sthat?W&L
students are not known for dating. You meet

Mr. or Ms. Adequate at a party, then some other
stuff happens. A few weeks later, you might
have a boyfriend/girlfriend. Or you might not.
No telling.

W&Lparties are also populated with women
from Our Fine Neighboring Women’s Col-
leges. Some of them are really cool. Some of
them are not. (The same could be applied to
W&L students). W&L women and women
from down the road historically don’t get along.
Let me be the first (and perhaps only) to admit
that this is because (1) They are competition

and (2) We are jealous. What about the stereo- .

type that they come to W&L to drink beer and
meet guys? Well, think about it: wouldn’t you?
‘ The Final Word: After having read this.

whole thing, you’ve probably come to one ‘

conclusion: I have no idea what I’m talking
about. So be it. No one can tell you how to be
cool. Just relax. Have fun. Muddle through the
best you can. And avoid taco bar at Letitia Pate
Evans Dining Hall.

ANNE ALVORD ’98

Settling into W&L means more than
just learning your way around campus;
it also means learning your way around
Lexington. Big Lex may at first seem
stiﬂlngly small, but it has a lot to offer
if you take the time to look. I’ve never
failed to find what I need to buy in
Lexington, so I Anne “I Came, I Saw,
1 Charged” Alvord, with help from my
fellow Phi staff members, am going to
offer some advice on where to go for
what you need.

Clothes

I love Pappagallo, on Main Street,
for women’s clothing. Not only are the
people who work there fantastic (one
even knows where my home town is),
but they have terrific clothes and jew-
elry; they also have shoes. I also like
(l_aravan’s, on Nelson Street, a lot, and
I'buy all my hosiery at the College
Town Shop, also on Nelson Street.

Phi Executive Editor Dan Odenwald
tells me that the College Town Shop is
the place to go for men’s clothes in
Lexington. Being a mere woman, I am
n t an authority, but I lean toward

vin Dennis, on Washington Street.
ey have ‘The Trident Belt’.

Since I’m on the topic of clothes, I
have to mention TGIF, on Main Street.
TGIF has lots of slightly irregular
clothes from J. Crew, The Gap,
Victoria’s Secret, and many others.

It’s even fun to say. Harris Teeter is
located on Nelson Street. It’s walking
distance if you don’t plan to buy much;
otherwise, get someone to drive you.
They’re open 24 hours, and they take
credit cards.

Ice Cream

I’m a big fan of Sweet Things. on
Washington Street. l’ve worked at Ben
and Jerry’s for four years, so I don’t
give praise to ice cream lightly, but I
give it to Sweet Things. They have
home-made ice cream, frozen yogurt,
soft serve, and candy.

Coffee

The Lexington Coffee Roasters is
fantastic. They

they deliver until at least midnight ev-
ery day.

General Delivery

Frank’s also delivers, and they have
a large variety of Italian food and sand-
wiches, in addition to pizza. The prices
are low and the portions are huge. I
think my exact words the first time I
ordered from Frank’s were “Wow.” In
addition to the dish I ordered, they sent
me a salad and a loaf of bread.

CasualDining

If you want a casual sit-down meal,
go to Harbs’, on Washington Street, or
Spanky’s, on Jefferson. Both have
sandwiches, though Harbs’ is a bit more

gourmet. Harbs’ also has an Omelette
of the Day and a Mexican plate.

A little bit up the formality scale is I]
Palazzo, on Main Street, but it’s still
casual by all means. They have really
good Italian, and great pizza too. For

something a little different, try the pizza

Fall sports look to improve on solid

By Soorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Sports Editor

After an extremely successful fall season in 1994,
the Washington and Lee Generals expect key returning
stars and some fresh faces to keep the ball rolling and
provide for an even more productive 1995 campaign.

Seven W&L squads compete this fall. Four men’s and
three women’s teams will carry the torch for W&L in
volleyball, soccer, football, water polo, and cross
country.

Water polo was the only sport to finish with a sub-
.500 mark last fall. Still the Generals’ 10-13 mark was
far from shabby considering the team earned a nation-
wide, al]-divisions ranking of 20 and a fourth-place
finish at the Eastern Seaboard Championships.

Coach Paige Remillard loses captain Derek DeVries
and goalie David Silvester who set a school record in
saves last year.

However, a deep squad returns in 1995, headed by
junior Peter Sorenson, the team leader in scoring and
assists, and a second-team All-East pick. Fellow junior
James Silberstein will also be counted on to shoulder
much of the scoring load for the Generals, who compete
in the Eastern Water Polo Association.

The W&L football squad took a pounding during an 0-
3 start in 1994 in which it scored a grand total of two
points.

By the end of the season, the rest of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference was no longer snickering. W&L
capped one of the most amazing turnarounds in team
history with four consecutive wins to finish the season,
highlighted by a stunning 13-7 upset of ODAC co-
champion Guilford.

The biggest change in 1995 comes at the top, as
former defensive coordinator Frank Miriello takes over
as interim head coach. Gary Fallon, who compiled a

Both the football and women’s soccer teams will be looking to

    

career record of 76-86-1 at W&L from 1978-94, died
April 29.

Coach Miriello will have to cope with the departures
of three-time ODAC receiving champion William Propst
and defensive standouts and tri-captains Stephen Cox,
Jason Chartrand, and Marc Newman. Yet a talent rich
returning committee should enable the Generals to pick
up where they left off in 1994.

Junior quarterback Brooks Fischer leads an offense
which began clicking by the conclusion of last season.
Sophomore Seth McKinley was a large reason behind the
offensive improvement as he racked up a W&L fresh-
man record 667 yards of the ground.

Senior defensive tackle Robert Hull anchors a men-
acing W&L defense which finished first in both pass and
scoring defense in the ODAC.

Seniors Stuart Hogue, Butler Ball, John Tweardy,
and junior McGuire Boyd should also contribute heavily
for the Generals, who open at Emory and Henry on
September 9.

The cross-country teams will have little trouble
being competitive this year. All both teams did last
season was capture the ODAC crown and place in the top
three at the Division lll Southeast Regionals.

Opposing teams must be tired of seeing seniors Amy
Mears and Josephine Schaeffer on the courses for yet
another year. Mears and Schaeffer were first-team
All-Region selections last year, and both earned a trip
to Nationals.

Women’s coach Jim Phemister does lose co-captains
Sue Deutsch and Kim Herring, but the likes of junior Nat
Messmore and sophomores Maren Wright and Carson
Flowers will aid the Generals in their quest for a fourth
consecutive ODAC title.

The entire men’s team returns this fall after a third-
place finish at the Southeast Regionals in 1994.

Sandy Hooper, and sophomores Jason Callen, Will Olson,

Callen missed out on nationals last season by only two
spots with his 10th place finish at the regionals.

The W&L women’s soccer team took the ODAC by
storm last season with a 10-5 overall record, thanks
in large part to high-scoring sophomore Erica Reineke.
Reineke, who was involved in seven records in her
freshman campaign, will be assisted by fellow sopho-
more, goalie Delia Coyle, and juniors Michelle Bauman
and Jenni Grant. Coach Jan Hathorn’s youthful squad
will need to overcome the departures of six seniors to
graduation, though.

The women receive their first test September 9 at
the Kean Tournament in Kean, NJ.

Men’s soccer coach Rolf Piranian loses four key
contributors from last season’s 7-7-2 squad, but he
retains a young core led by sophomores Gordon Meeker,
the team’s second leading scorer, and Michael Germain.

Of course, the experience of seniors Jeb Wofford,
the 1994 offensive MVP, midfielder Shag Drewry,
goalie Fernando Bravo, and junior goalie Anthony
Mazzarelli will not exactly hinder the Generals’ shot at
moving up into the first division this fall.

The men travel to Shenandoah University on Septem-
ber 9 for their opening battle.

Volleyball capped off an outstanding 1994 season
with a 19-8 log and a trip to the ODAC semifinals.

W&L fans can expect to see more of the same in the
coming months as coach Terry Dadio returns nearly her
entire team, with the notable exception of Goose
Garrigus. However senior Cheryl Taurassi, who owns
the W&L career assists record, anchors a talented
returning nucleus, which also consists of senior Allison
Hull, junior Elizabeth Bahn, and sophomores Hilary
Martin and Holly Thomsen.

The Generals will receive shot

their first at a

possible 20-win season when they battle Christopher
Newport on September 9, the date on which Washington
and Lee kicks off its 1995-96 athletic schedule.
