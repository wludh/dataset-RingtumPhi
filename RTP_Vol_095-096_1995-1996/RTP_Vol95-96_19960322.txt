Journalists mull over ethics

BY MICHAEL HEWLEIT
Phi Associate Editor

This past weekend, March 15-16,
students in Journalism Ethics and Pro-
fessor Brian Richardson went to the
Hotel Roanoke to mull over some ethi-
cal decisions.

This was part of the annual Joumal-
ism Ethics Institute that brings work-
ing journalists from various newspa-
pers such as ThePhilade1phia Inquirer,
The Richmond Times-Dispatch, and
The Roanoke Times.

The journalists and students tack-
led such issues as publishing the
names of rape victims and airing a
story in which a woman is shot by
her husband.

Journalists brought cases in which
they were faced with ethical dilemas.
Cases ranged from whether to publish
a pictures showing burned children to
revealing in a story a woman who
committed suicide six months after her
boyfriend was murdered.

The Washington and Lee chapter of
Society of Professional Journalists

sponsored a cocktail for the partici-
pants at the Radisson-Patrick Henry. A
dinner sponsored by The Roanoke
Times was held afterward.

Many students thought the .loumal-
ism Ethics Institute offered an oppor-
tunity to see actual cases that involved
the ethical issues they had discussed in
class.

the case that Mark Holmberg, a re-
porter from TheRichmond Times-Dis-
patch. discussed. The paper decided to
publish pictures that cropped out chil-
dren who had been brought out of a
burning building.

Senior Justin Dardani said one of
the most interesting things for him as

a business management major was
that many of the more difficult
ethical issues had to do with financial
concerns.

“It was interesting to see how pro-
fessional journalists grapple with eth-
ics in comparison with our discussions
in class.”

‘‘I think it was very
useful for both students
and professionals,” Me-
lissa Byrd ’96 said. “We
[students] don ’t have the
experience of dealing
with ethical decisions on
a daily basis.”

Senior Dani Wong
agreed.

“I thought it helped
students a lot to see pro-
fessionals have to deal
with ethical questions
such as ‘Should I pub-
lish this?’,” she said.

She also thinks the
cases stimulated a lot of
discussion.

Byrd said she was
particularly interested in

Car accident injures
two; damages wall

BY ERIKA SNYDER
Special to the Phi

Two Lexington residents were in-
jured Friday when a woman lost con-
trol of her car, hitting a pedestrian and
a brick wall.

Lexington Police Chief Bruce Beard
said 62-year-old Margaret Knapp-
wife of former Virginia Military Insti-
tute Superintendent John Knapp—was
driving on North Main Street when she
hit 18-year-old Natalie Wallace.

The car continued almost 500 feet
before striking the brick wall on
Jefferson Street that borders the Wash-

ington and Lee campus.

Knapp and Wallace were taken to
Stonewall Jackson Hospital.

Wallace was treated for minor inju-
ries, then released a few hours later.

Knapp was admitted, then trans-
ferred to Roanoke Memorial Hospital
Monday morning. Although she is still
hospitalized, her husband said she is
doing well.

Authorities are still investigating
the cause of the accident.

Acquaintances of Knapp say she is
known to have a history of heart trouble,
which may have been a factor in the
incident.

W&L Buildings and Grounds
worker Jim Arthur said that the esti-
mated damage to the wall is $3,300.

Can 1 get a witness? A testimony to
what God has done?

Well, Michael Eric Dyson, an or-
dained minister as well as Professor of
Communications Studies at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,
testiﬂes to something otherthan God in
his new book, Between God and
Gangsta Rap: Bearing Witness toBlack
Culture. He contends that the variety
within black culture is between these
two extremes of religious faith and
gangsta rap.

At times personal and at othertimes
intellectually engaging, Dyson analyzes
trends in contemporary black culture
with the precision of a scholar and the
passion of a preacher.

And he makes interesting connec-
tions such as one between Smokey
Robinson and Shakespeare. The no-
tion of black culture and how it adds to
and is inﬂuenced by Western civiliza-
tion. Many white authors saw their

writing inﬂuenced by black writers just
as writers including Richard Wright
and James Baldwin were inﬂuenced by
white authors.

I think Dyson makes an important
point. So much of the debate about the
centrality of Western civilization in
American society seems to reach for
romantic past. The same criticism can
be made of Afrocentricity in which the
more vulgar proponents point to the
great Egyptian past without seeking to
find any complexity.

Both African and Western civiliza-
tions have value, but they also have
baibaristicqualitieswithinthemaswell.
Both sides of the argument forget-to
see how both cultures have comple-
mented each other and ignore the whole
notion of cultural exchange.

Dyson also tackles controversial
issues such as afﬁrmative action, O.J.
Simpson (are you surprised?), and the
idea of racial purity. More impor-
tantly, he offers a refreshing evalua-
tion of Martin Luther King, Jr. that
shows he was more radical than some
have claimed, especially in his later

///////////////////////////////ﬂﬂﬂl/ﬂﬂ/////////////////ﬂ/////////////////////ﬂ//////////////////////////////////////////ﬂ/////////////////////////////////////////ﬂ/////////////////////////////////ﬂ

years.

Another controversial issue is
gangsta rap. C. Delores Tucker and
William Bennett have made it their
point to criticize gangsta rap as trash-
ing American culture. Dyson answers
the critics, arguing that censoring
gangsta rap is not the way in which to
solve the problems that these rappers
bring up in their music.

Furthermore, he contends that while
the rampant sexism and violence con-
tained within the lyrics need to be chal-
lenged on all levels, a criticism of this
music should not overlook its legiti-
mate critiques of American society and
its failures to extend democracy and
equality to all people.

In the end, Dyson writes a book that
bears witness to black culture and to
American society as a whole. His
voice needs to be heard in this hostile
political climate in which we live.
Certainly, the reader will not agree
with all his views, but he might, as I
did, ﬁnd himself saying, “Amen” a
couple times before he ﬁnishes the
book.

That FD feeling

Fancy Dress is here again. The dresses are
bought, the dinner reservations have been made,
and the Coolio tickets are burning a hole in your
pocket. What exactly is it about FD that gets
this campus so worked up? It can’t be the
excessive amounts of alcohol being consumed -
— that ’s no different than any other weekend. It
can’t be the intolerable amounts of work your
professors pile on you the week of the big
event. Any student who has ever survived mid-
term week can tell you that. It can’t be the
balloons or fireworks or whatever the hell
they’re planning to drop on this year (or aren’t
planning to drop on us). The theme? C’mon, I
haven’t read Alice in Wonderland since the
second grade (and even then we read the Cliff
Notes).

So why is FD such a big deal? March
Madness is a whole lot more interesting. The
Whitewater debacle is a whole lot more impor-
tant.

Perhaps FD means something to everyone.
For one guy I know, it’s the dozen roses he
bought his girlfriend. For one young lady, it’s
the excitement of getting to fox trot in a real
gown. Well, whatever it is (shameless Clueless
plug), it’s usually fun.

So be merry, be smart, and be safe.

Happy Fancy Dress! (Tarah Grant and

Drug War: ’90’s style Prohibition

MY VIEW

Jason Sorens, ’98

Crime is one of the fastest—growin g
problems in America today. But in
proponion to the magnitude of this
problem, the solutions politicians have
offered us have been extremely mild.
Quick—fix “solutions” like building
more prisons and issuing longer sen-
tences are expensive and ineffective.
More drastic measures, such as ex-
ecuting drug dealers and rolling back
civil liberties are totalitarian and unac-
ceptable.

I think that we can solve the crime
problem with two fundamental
changes: decriminalizing victimless
crimes and ending government control
over the justice system. In this col-
umn, I will focus on the first option. In
particular, I will show that ending the
War on Drugs is a necessary first step
toward reducing crime drastically.

The War on Drugs has been both a
moral and a practical failure. In moral
terms, the War on Drugs has spawned
a hideous government takeover of
Americans’ civil liberties. In practical
terms, the War on Drugs has not re-
duced drug use but hasinstead spawned
a massive crime wave throughout the
United States.

There is no moral justification for
banning substances. The logic that
would justify prohibiting people from
voluntarily buying selling, and using
drugs is the same logic that would
justify prohibiting people from eating
candy or drinking alcohol. Those who
subscribe to this twisted view would
like to imprison people “for their own
good.” No matter how they might
sugar-coat it with excuses such as,
“Society needs a sober and healthy
working force,” the fundamental rea-
son is just the same: intolerance of
other lifestyles. Using the abstraction
“society” just ignores the real forces at

work. Getting rid of drugs is not as
simple a matter as cleaning out
“society’s” house. What the govem-
ment really is doing is trying to clean
out the houses of all 250 million Ameri-
can individuals.

Some people say that we need to
ban drugs to prevent people from act-
ing violently under the inﬂuence of
drugs. But the fact is that narcotics are
sedatives; they make people less likely
to become violent. Indeed, alcohol is
more likely than marijuana or LSD to
promote violence, but we rejected pro-
hibition of alcohol long ago.

And even if drugs did promote vio-
lence, shouldn’t we concentrate on
those violent acts instead of the sub-
stance itself? Shouldn’t we punish the
people who commit violence instead
of everyone who might use a particular
substance? It is a grossly backward
policy to prosecute people for using a
substance that might cause them to
become violent instead of prosecuting
those who do become violent. The
basic fact is that the government is
trying to do too much. If we concen-
trated our resources on ﬁghting real
violence instead of all manner of “vic-
timless crimes,” we would do a lot
more to reduce violence. This theory
is borne out by the fact that our prisons
are now crowded with drug dealers
and users. In 1990, for the first time,
the number of people sentenced to
prison for drug crimes exceeded the
number of people sentenced for vio-
lent crimes. Meanwhile, murderers
and rapists walk free.

As I wrote before, the drug war has
all the marks of a failed government
policy. After years of futile battles, the
government has decided to extend its
power in yet another attempt to crush
the enemy. Here is a list of a few
atrocities that the U.S. government has
perpetrated in its drug assault. I am
taking these examples from James
Bovard’s book, Lost Rights.

Willie Jones of Nashville was de-

tained by Drug Enforcement Agency
agents at an airport because he was
black and used cash to pay for his
airplane ticket. After a two-year legal
battle, he got his money back.

In Volusia County, Florida, the
police department has used forfeiture
laws to seize motorists’ vehicles and
money. Between 1989 and 1992, they
seized over $8 million, but in three-
fourths of these cases, no criminal
charges were ever filed.

On October 2, 1992, thirty-one fed-
eral agents stormed the California ranch
of sixty-one year old Donald Scott.
Bovard writes, “Scott's wife screamed
when she saw the intruders, Scott came
out of the bedroom with a pistol in his
hands, and the police gunned him down.
After killing Scott, the agents thor-
oughly searched his house and ranch
but failed to ﬁnd any illicit drugs.”
Furtherinvestigation revealed that the
Los Angeles County Sheriff’ s Depart-
ment had cooked up a bogus warrant in
an attempt to seize the ranch, which
was worth $1.1 million.

“In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, po-
lice seized the $250,000 home of a
dead man from his heirs who had cared
for him while he was dying of cancer.”
The sole justification for the seizure
was an anonymous inforrnant’s vague
assertion that the owner had once taken
$10,000 from drug dealers. The police
had no other evidence.

The federal government officially
encourages children to turn in their
parents, a technique reminiscent of the
Communist Bloc. In Maryland, Colo-
rado, Wisconsin, and Georgia, chil-
dren turned in their parents to the drug
authorities, who congratulated the kids
on their service to the state.

Aside from these most egregious
intrusions, the government has caused
a widespread crime disaster through
drug prohibition, just as it did during
alcohol prohibition. Just as in alcohol
prohibition, the controlled substances
have become more potent since the

government launched full-scale efforts.
‘‘In the early 19805, $10 heroin bags in
New York contained only 3 or 4 per-

cent heroin; now the average purity is 5,.

64 per cent,” Bovard reports. Because
of higher concentrations, the number
of addicts has gone up. The number of
heroin addicts rose from 500,000 to
700,000 in the mid-1980s.

The drug war has lowered the sup-
ply of drugs, but thereby raised the
potency and the prices, just as oc-
curred during alcohol prohibition. The
result has been more addicts, more

theft by addicts who need to support “

their habits and more turf wars be-
tween drug dealers who fight over the
lucrative drug trade. According to
economist Clark Warburton, during
alcohol prohibition, alcohol use in-
creased dramatically: liquor by 520%
per capita, wine by 97% per capita, and
beer by 447% per capita. Prohibition
also made alcohol more potent: of the
480,000 gallons of liquor confiscated

in New York state during one year of ‘

Prohibition, 98% contained poison.
Also, younger people became more
involved in became associated with
gang warfare, just as drug dealing is
today.

The parallels between the drug war
and alcohol prohibition are too exact to
be ignored. Just as alcohol prohibition
failed miserably, so the drug war is

failing miserably. Before we banned .
drugs in 1914, we had no national drug '

problem, and before we stepped up the
War on Drugs in 1968 and again in
1981, we had less of a problem than we
do now. One estimate holds that re-

legalizing drugs would reduce violent T

crime by seventy-five per cent. The
overwhelming evidence suggests that
it’s time to end the drug war. And
while we’re at it, let’s decriminalize
other nonviolent activites, such as pros-
titution, gambling, voluntary sodomy,
and gun ownership. Let’s take the first
step toward reducing true crime in
America.

Revamped presidential debates;

MY VIEW
Nova Clarke, ’96

I’m sure everyone would like to hear about some-
thing other than presidential politics. I’m a bit tired
of them and it’s only primary season—-but there
really isn’t a way to talk about politics that isn’t
related to presidential questions. I was in DC this
weekend for a conference on the presidency so I got
a full four days on all aspects of the presidency and
the election. We did have several very good speak-
ers. One of my favorites was General McCaffery,
the new drug czar. He is a great speaker and if I was
a drug dealer or addict, I would be a lot more worried
about having him afterme than any of the other drug
czars like Bill Bennett. By the time he was done
speaking, there was almost a movement on the ﬂoor
to draft him for President. However, one of the more
interesting speakers and one who was trying to be
non-partisan but didn’t quite succeed when it came
to questioning was Frank Farrenkoph, the former
chairof the RNC and current co-chairof the commis-
sion on presidential debates.

He talked about the presidential debates and the
actual election. The debate scheme was sort of inter-
esting. The first debate is going to be a roundtable
with the candidates sitting at a table and not behind
a podium. This is because studies show they are
more likely to be open in such a situation. The
second one is a townhall meeting where a selected
group of voters who have not made up their mind
about who they are going to vote for will get to ask
questions of the candidates. The final presidential
debate will have‘ the candidates back behind the
podiums. The interesting part of the setup is that
there will only be one moderator for each of the
debates in order to prevent the reporters and network
anchors from upstaging the candidates. It will also
give the candidates more time to actually answer
each of the questions. He pointed out that the 1992
debates set a record for viewing, the first debate
having the largest audience in history and the

audience’s increasing each time. This is definitely a
positive sign of the public’s engagement in politics
and their inclination to look beyond the simple 30
second sound bites that dominate network TV. Rupert
Murdoch, of all people has also offered to lose some
money and help educate the public by donating spots
on Fox for presidential candidates. This isn’t quite
the same as forcing every voting-age person in
America to closely examine the exact stands of all
the candidates on the issues but it will give them a
view beyond the 30 second sound bite.

The other interesting part of his speech was his
insight into the way the campaign will play out. He
pointed out that the American public is generally
divided into three groups: the 40% that always vote
with the Democrats, the 40% that always vote with
the Republicans and the 20% that are up for grabs
and provide the winning majorities. 1992 proved
this rule. Clinton got 43%, Bush 38%, and Ross
Perot 19%. The two major party candidates got a
base vote of around 40% and Perot swept the unde-
cided middle. Therefore the political parties both
target this middle 20% but they only do it in 20 states,
the ones with the most electoral votes and where the
respective parties think they have the best chance of
winning. States like California, Florida, Texas, New
York, and the big Midwest states like Illinois, Indi-
ana, and Ohio. These states have enough electoral
votes that they can make or break a winner who can
then ignore states like Montana, Alaska, and Dela-
ware or Rhode Island.

The parties target their advertising and spend
their money in these few states. The citizens become
the recipients of the attention that was paid the voters
of Iowa and New Hampshire in February. The
candidates spend half their campaigns in these states
and are very careful to make sure nothing is done that
might upset the citizenry like not responding to a
disaster fast enough. These states have media at-
tacks blasted at them about the issues that appeal to
them the most. I can assure you that you won’t be
hearing many ads directed at allowing subsistence
hunting but you will hear a lot about education and
welfare reform.

The issues that Mr. Farrenkoph mentioned were
also sort of interesting although we had heard a
completely different perspective two days earlier at
the Brookings Institute. He didn’t think the cam-
paigns would bring up affirmative action because
neither side would want to antagonize any major
groups of voters. His feeling was that the economy
and welfare and healthcare reform would be major
issues. The economy because at this rate there will
never be a budget approved for this ﬁscal year and
the U.S. will be in some pretty tough times if that
happens. Welfare and healthcare reform are very
important and if there was not a presidential election
this year than these issues would probably be re-
solved. The President and the Congress both agreed

on a welfare reform bill that would have been signed I

if the Republicans in the Senate hadn’t added a
Medicare rider that was unacceptable to the Presi-
dent and the Democrats. A straight bill would have
made it through and the Dole would not have been
able to point to the President as a stumbling block, a
strategy that was more or less admitted to by one of
the Republican governors and potential vice presi-
dential candidates. He also suggested that the char-
acter issue might not be that much of an issue. The
press really hasn’t started looking to hard at Bob
Dole and one never knows what might be dug up-
his handlers also haven’t given him free reign to
speak to the press either and when that happens Bob
Dole might be done for. The American public has
already heard so much about Whitewater that there
really is nothing that the Republicans can do with
that unless they force every voter to read James
Stewart’s new book—Bloodsport about Whitewater.

Well, speaking of vice presidential candidates.
Who knows—l don’t think Colin Powell will go for

it despite all the speculation. It will probably be a ‘,

midwestern governor like John Engler of Michigan
or Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. In the end it
doesn’t make that much of a difference because most

people don’t really consider the vice presidential .

candidate when they vote; although there are excep-
tions like me who liked Clinton a lot better when he
chose Al Gore as his running mate.

DREAM LAND
Richard Weaver

I guess you all know what Friday
is...it’s a regular day of classes, with
real work and everything!

SOME of you may have the Fancy
Dress Ball on your minds, and for the
approximately four people don’t, and

M are actually reading the Phi today, I

,1;

present to you the reason for staying
home that you’ve been looking for:
I’m announcing the Third Annual
Dream Land Awards of Achievement.

These prestigious awards, known
as the “Dreammys,” are not decided on
lightly. I spent nearly an entire after-
noon thinking of things that amused
me in different ways this past year. lt’s
something I can do while watching TV
at the same time.

In the category of Best Item Avail-
able for Purchase at the Lee-Hi Truck
Stop, this year’s winner is Cookin’ in
Reba Country, a recipe book which
includes instructions for preparing
Kentucky Fried Rabbit, as well as
Friend Brains (“Place brains in cold
water for 30 minutes, then remove
membranes...”). The recipe for Texas

Rattlesnake includes the helpful first
step: 1) Find and capture a Western
Diamondback Rattlesnake as well as
8) Eat It!. Sounds like a good Letitia
Pate Evans Dining Hall theme night, if
I ever heard

stances Glamour Shots is a classy op-

An honorable mention for Best

are by appointment only. What really
make this car special, though, is the
little picture of a wizard holding a
sparking staff in they sky. I’m not sure
what it has to do with tattoos but per-
haps it relates to the “RN Needle Care”

listed on the card. Sign me up.

The Dreammy for Best New Stop-
In Food Item goes to the microwaveable
cod sandwich, fresh from the freezer. I
recently purchased one of these from
my Least Favorite Stop-In Employee,
Don. They taste slightly like fish,
which is a bonus.

I never thought of cod as a conve-
nience store staple, but who knows,
this could be the beginning ofa whole
new offering of Stop-In seafood. Imag-
ine, if you will, live Stop-In lobsters in
an aquarium next to the hot dog roller.
Don would happily kill one for you
while he’s waiting for you to show him
your ID for the beer to go with it.

The Best World Wide Web Site
Dreammy goes to the homepage called
“Richard Weaverand His Pants” (http:/
/www.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk./!llykstw/
richmain.html). It was created by a
British student with an incredible sense
of humor, as you can imagine. “Do
you know, you just would not believe
how many people want to examine my
pants!” Richard says. In another sec-
tion he adds, “...My main interests
include beer (pronounced “BEEEEEE-
OOOR”). I have to meet this guy.

These are just a few of my favorite
things. Maybe you’ll like them too.

Generals pick up victory

ball hard consistently, but the Marlins
played sufficient defense to silence the
Generals offense.

But, an immediate loss did not
dampen the Generals’ spirits.

The second game was a battle of
pitching and was in large part won by

Ermigiotti.

The Generals’ veteran southpaw
pitched his first complete game of the
year, yielding no earned runs and sti-
ﬂing the Marlins for seven innings.

He also maintained a strong pres-
ence at the plate, driving in two runs to
clinch the Generals’ first ODAC win of
the season, despite a slow day for the
Generals at the plate.

Ermigiotti currently leads the team
in innings pitched and has solidified

his place as the Generals’ number one
pitcher.

The W&L baseball team’s sched-
uled game at Lynchburg Tuesday was
postponed because of rain. The game
will be made up at a date and time to be
announced.

The Generals continue their ODAC
action Thursday at Eastern Mennonite,
weather permitting, and return home
for a game against Hampden-Sydney
March 27th.

On Sunday, the Generals were defeated by Salisbury
State, 4-3. W&L dropped its top three singles matches and
all three doubles matches. Senior Andy Horen, Taylor, and
Aday won their singles matches.

Taylor won Athlete of the Week honors last week after
compiling a perfect 4-0 singles record against Sewanee,
Hampden-Sydney, Salisbury State, and Mary Washington.

W&L’s scheduled home match with Averett College
was rained out Tuesday. The match is rescheduled for April

The men’s tennis team split its matches last weekend,
beating Hampden-Sydney, 5-2, but dropping to Salisbury
State, 4-3.

Against Hampden-Sydney, senior Chris MacNaughton,
freshman Dale Pretila, senior Jesse Taylor, and senior Ryan

Rodman’s performance earns a 6

THE BIG FAN, from page 8

only too happy to oblige, sticking Rod-
man with a 6-game suspension and a
$20,000 fine.

It will be interesting to see how
Rodman’s suspension will affect the
Bulls. Scottie Pippen is already in-
jured and a host of frontcouit backups
are shelved for various reasons. Even
if Michael Jordan scores 40 points per
game, not too many teams will be
scared ofToni Kukoc and Luc Longley.
Or the Bulls could bring big, bad, Bill
Wennington off the bench.

The Bulls nearly lost the other night
to the Sixers, a team so bad that Derrick

Coleman won’t even play for them.
Even Shawn Bradley, of all people,
improved once he left town.

Getting back to the Bulls, no matter
how flaky Rodman is, the truth is that
he’s a good player. Chicago may not
have to worry much now, but Rodman’s
presence could ultimately be the dif-
ference in winning a championship.
Wonder if Dennis knows that?

The Bulls will need to concentrate
as much on keeping Rodman under
control forthe rest of the season as they
will on winning 70 games.

Believe it or not, winter sports are
still playing. Well, the teams have
finished, but Rebekah Prince and

Men’s lacrosse picks up key Victory .
Generals leave # 3 Gettysburg in the mud, 12-5, at R.C.H.S.

W&L, shown here in a recent game with Cortland State, leapt over Gettysburg, 12-5, on Saturday, improving its record to 5-1.

Track has mixed
results in W&L
Invitational

By Scorr BOOKWALTER
Phi Sports Editor

The Generals track squads.
displayed contrasting perfor-
mances in Saturday’s 5th An-
nual W&L Invitational.

While the men struggled to a
12th place finish out of 16
schools, the women picked up
the slack by ﬁnishing ﬁfth out of
the 17 competing schools as
Washington and Lee kicked off
its outdoor track season.

The women ﬁnished with a
total of 58 points, trailing John
Carroll’s 65 points, Thiel’s 74
points, Allegheny’s 75 points
and Williams’s 121 points. Wil-
liams cruised to an easy team
victory in both the men’s and
women’s events.

Once again, the women were
led by senior Josephine
Schaeffer. Schaefferdidn’twaste
much time picking up where she
left off in the indoor season, as
she lit up the 10,000 meter run

with a meet record time of
36:45.7.

matic qualiﬁer for the NCAA
Outdoor Championships by more
than 25 seconds.

Sophomore Carson Flowers
also turned in a stellar perfor-
mance in the 10,000 as she
crossed the line second behind
Schaeffer with a time of 38:47.00.

Senior Lyrae Van Clief had
an outstanding meet, as she shat-
tered a W&L school record by
ﬁnishing second in the 400 meter
dash in 1:00.19. Junior Hollis
Leddy ﬁnished the 400 in Van
Clief’s tracks, placing third in
1:01.77.

Leddy and Van Clief also ﬁn-
ished right behind each other in
the 200 meter dash, with Leddy
placing fifth with a 27.42 and
Van Clief crossing the line in
sixth with a 27.53.

Junior Nat Messmore and
freshman Natasha Dorofeeva ﬁn-
ished ﬁfth and sixth, respectively,
in the 1 ,500 meterrun. Messmore
recorded a 5:04.24 and Dorofeeva

Mm  

logged a 5:07.92.

Freshman lsaris Bonilla raced
into ﬁfth place in the 400 meter
dash in 1:03.57. Senior Sandra
Holmes looked strong in the jav-
elin, as she tossed it 105-6 1/2.

Both the 400 and the 1,600
meter relay teams fared ex-
tremely well. The 400 relay team
placed ﬁfth in 52.79 and the 1,600
relay team dashed into the third
spot in 4:15.35. Both times were
good enough for school records.

The men had a rougher time
on Saturday, closing with only 8
points. Williams, with 136
points, captured the men’s cham-

pionship by 67 points over sec-
ond-place ﬁnisher Susquehanna.

Sophomore Jason Callen was
the men’s standoutwith his fourth
place ﬁnish in the 5,000 meter run
in 15:37.34.

Senior Harris Morrison and
junior Sandy Hooper also placed
for the Generals. Morrison
grabbed ﬁfth place in the pole
vault with a 13-6, and Hooper
crossed the ﬁnish stripe in 2:01.54
in the 800 meter run.

The Generals track teams will
next be in action this Thursday
when they compete at Bridgewater
starting at 3:00 PM.

Women’s tennis
cruises to ]1-0

Generals stomp Guilford,
Salisbury State, Amherst

By JASON ZACHER
Phi Staff Writer

The women’s tennis team defeated Guilford Wednesday, 8-0.
This win extended their perfect record to 11-0 over:-ll, 7-0 in the
ODAC. Last weekend, the Generals defeated Salisbury State and

third-ranked Amherst.

The Generals were expected to have a difﬁcult time on the road
with Guilford, but they ended up having no problems against the
Quakers. Leading the way for the Generals against Guilford were
senior Julie Ayers and Shelley Sunderman, and sophomores Berry
Blankinship, Ericka Shapard, and Bryce Bendall all captured their

singles matches.

The match was called due to darkness during the number-six
singles match, so the ﬁnal count remained at 8-0. .

Last weekend, W&L dropped national power Amherst College,
6-3. Sophomores Natalia Garcia and Shapard led the way for the
Generals in the number-one and number-three slots, with each
rallying to win after dropping the ﬁrst set.

Sunderman and freshman Mary Celeste Foster also won their

singles matches for the Generals.

In doubles action, the top two teams from W&L, Ayers and
Garcia, and Shapard and Blankinship, both won their matches.

Last Sunday, Salisbury State became another victim of the
Generals, losing 7-2. Ayers, Shapard, senior Helen Chandler,
freshman Martha Kieckhefer, and freshman Laura Cohen all won

their singles matches.

Garcia and Ayers combined to win their doubles match. Chan-
dler and Sunderman picked up the other doubles victory.

This weekend, the Generals will be looking to extend their
winning streak when they host Mary Washington at 1 PM Saturday,
and Williams College at 3:30 PM Sunday.

Owe «ﬁrm at 

Alice was beginning to get very tired of waiting in the freshman quad for her friends to pick her up. As she leaned
against the railing and sighed, her dream Fancy Dress date rounded the corner and ran by her. So, with nothing better
to do she decided to see where he was going.

Just after he crossed bee Avenue, he ducked into a mysterious comer. Of course, Alice blindly followed.
Suddenly, she felt herself falling down a deep, deep hole. When she ﬁnally landed, her dream date was nowhere to

be found, but she was in a room with dozens of doors. Naturally, Alice assumed that there was a party behind one‘

of them, but she didn’t know which door belonged to which fraternity.

Thankfully, before she became too distressed about ﬁnding a party, she spotted a tall glass bottle labeled “Drink
Me," ﬁlled with red liquid. Although the drink wasn’t in a trash can, she immediately recognized it and relaxed. She
chugged it as quickly as she could and waited a few minutes, until she began to feel the effects. “What a curious
feeling!” she said.

Growing a little more adventurous, she opened one of the doors to ﬁnd a lovely garden. Well, this looks sort of
like Davidson Park, she thought. She walked through the door, and was having a terriﬁc time dancing until an intense
hunger gripped her. With thoughts of Stop-in and Domino’s racing through her head, she searched madly for food.
She was relieved to ﬁnd a cake sitting in the comer with speciﬁc instructions to eat it. Satisﬁed, she returned to the
party to dance and caught another glimpse of her elusive dream date. In her excitement, she knocked over a trash can,
spilling the fruity punch which ﬂooded the garden.

Caught in the current, Alice ﬂoated alongside the pigs, lions, vultures, stallions, and dodo birds that had been at
the party, but W & L had well-prepared her for being surrounded by such creatures. The punch ﬁnally drained away,
leaving only a sticky and dirty ﬂoor. After drying herself off, Alice decided to venture to another party.

She found herself in a room where an unmarked bottle waited for her. She said to herself, “I know something
interesting is sure to happen whenever I drink anything, so l’ll just see what this bottle does.”

Feeling a little dizzy, she decided to step outside for some fresh air. The next thing she knew, she was lost in
the woods and completely disoriented. But, a familiar sight quickly put her at ease. Several yards away, a blue
caterpillar smoking a long hookah sat atop a large mushroom. This is more like it, Alice thought. The caterpillar asked
her how she was doing, so she answered, “I feel different. I can’t remember things as I used to.” She giggled
incessantly as she stumbled on.

She soon ran into the handsome Cheshire Cat, whose charming grin appealed to Alice. But like her dream date,
he kept appearing and disappearing, so she kept wandering.

After strolling through the forest for some time, Alice ﬁnally happened upon a party. Unfortunately, it consisted
of a mad hatter and a march hare sipping on tea. They invited her in, suggesting that she relax with a glass of wine.
But when Alice sat down she discovered that the tea party was dry. Furious, she stormed out and continued her trek.

Eventually, she found the garden again. Walking in with a sigh of relief, she came upon three gardeners ﬁghting,
another familiar sight. I never thought I’d be comforted by such meatiness, she thought. As she strolled further into
the garden, she was thrilled to see all the party-goers playing a new drinking game that they called croquet. Anxious
to join in the fun, she grabbed a mallet and began to play.

After losing several games and paying the consequences, Alice’s gripping hunger returned. The scent of
delicious tarts from a plate beside the Queen of Hearts’ throne caught her attention. Desperate for anything she could
get her hands on, she crept behind the throne and devoured the pastries.

Several minutes later, as Alice was teaching her new friends how to play I Never, a horriﬁed shout came from
the Queen. Her tarts had been stolen and immediately a nearby knave of hearts was accused. The Queen quickly
called an open trial to order and asked Alice to testify. Although Alice knew the consequences of lying, she didn’t
want to admit to stealing the tarts, so she swore that she had seen the knave commit the offense.

As she stepped off the witness stand, Alice brushed some crumbs from her shirt. The Queen gasped and pointed
her ﬁnger at Alice. “Off with her head!,” the Queen cried. Just as the Queen’s army of cards descended upon her,
Alice woke up to the sound of the Lee Chapel bell and her friends’ laughter as they approached.

“Oh, l’ve had such a curious dream!” Alice said.

As you glide down the rabbit hole into
the garden of live ﬂowers Friday night,
give a little thought to what it took to
transform Doremus Gym into Wonder-
land.

The process begins when the decora-
tions committee brainstorms for scenery
ideas.

The gym is divided into seven differ-

with the physical construction
and manual labor necessary to
carry out their elaborate plans.
Workers get two FD tickets for

ent areas, each of which has a committee.
The head of each formulates an idea for his
or her area and submits a design and a
budget.

Materials are ordered from Lexington
Building Supply and the Farmers’ Co-op.
Once everything comes in, the long process
of constructing it all culminates in aweek of
late nights.

“The decorations this year are very
surreal,” says Anne Howard, decorations
chairman. “We wanted to do something

different than all the other years.”

Here’s a tour through Wonderland:

Upon stepping through the pages of
the book, you will fall down the rabbit hole,
past plants and flowers.

Turn right into the Queen’s Garden, or
left into the forest. Explore the forest, walk-
ing past trees and ﬂowers and a giant mush-
room.

Climb the stairs to the Mad Tea Party,
where refreshments will be sold.

At the start of the week, the gym still
looks more like the gym than Wonderland.

Tuesday,12:52 p.m. Japanese lanterns
hang from the balcony ceiling, which, by
Friday will be the scene of the Tea Party.
Buildings and Grounds workers begin to
lay down the tarp that party-goers will
walk on in the big gym Friday night. Sheets
of blue celophane cover the ﬂourescent
lights in the hallway.

Wednesday, 4:11 p.m. Apileofpapier-
mache mushrooms lies on the ﬂoor of the
big gym, waiting to be placed upright. The
echos of seven hammers reverberate off
the gym walls as workers nail together the

boards that will form

ners.

Thursday, 12:02
a.m. Day-glo
styrofoam cut—outs line
the walls ofthe tunnel.
The small gym is basi-
cally ﬁnished; all that
remains is to put the
tree heads on the trees
that line the gym.

The drapes
around the edges of the
big gym are hung, and
the talking flower
heads are in place. The
risers are in place for
the 10 foot mushroom.

“A lot of the work
has to wait until the
last minute,” said Kris
Fegenbush, who’s
working on the en-
trance. “All the ﬂoral
stuff has to wait till the
last day, so the ﬂowers
won’t die. We’ll be here at the crack of
dawn Friday.”

Around 80 people take part in decora-
tion and construction process, spending
hours on details most party-goers fail to
notice.

Faculty at FD
...it's not all kid's play

BY HILLARY MARTIN
Special to the Phi

“Doing us a service by not going?”
What? How could Wayne Dymacek, pro-
fessor of mathematics, say that about FD?

Apparently, he is under the delusion
that students don’t want to see their profes-
sors at the 89th annual Fancy Dress. He
couldn’t be more wrong.

But this year, especially, he will be
missed. If Dymacek is not the Cheshire cat
incarnate, I don’t know who is.

Luckily, economics professor Linda
Hooks does not share Dymacek’s opinion
about sparing her students. On the con-
trary, she’ll be there with bells on-and also
with a date. She estimates that about halfof
the single faculty bring dates.

Hooks even changed her homework
assignments’ due dates from Friday to
Wednesday. Her students appreciate her
beneficence since the Coolio show will
leave no time for schoolwork.

Don’t expect to see too many profes-
sors at the Coolio concert. When Holger
Gottstein, a transfer German teaching as-
sistant was asked about Coolio, he said,
“Oh is that what they are selling tickets for?
Never heard of him.”

With regards to a date, Holger is hop-
ing to be set up. Apparently, sophomore
Steve Komonytsky promised he would
“manage something for him.”

German Professor Roger Crockett
thinks Coolio is a fine choice for entertain-
ment, if rap is the sound of choice. Crockett
likes Coolio’s anti—drugs, anti—violence
positions.

Everyone’s favorite bow-tied baby
boomer is very excited about this FD. Dean
Manning thinks the theme is “very imagi-
native,” although he, like many of his co-
horts, was a “little perplexed” by the invita-
tions.

Michelle Richardson just assumed it
was a major printing problem.

She remembers fondly last year’s FD
since it was also her birthday.

“We danced a lot and had a really good
time,” she said.

For most of the faculty, this will not be
their first FD. Michelle Richardson has
been once; Linda Hooks, twice; Roger
Crockett, five times; Dean Manning,
eleven; and, oh, Wayne Dymacek, never.

When asked what character they would
most like to see in the Warner Center,
heregs how they responded:

Holger Gottstein: Alice, because he
didn’t know any other characters.
Roger Crockett: the Mad Hatter

Linda Hooks: Alice

Wayne Dymacek: the Queen of Hearts
“because she cut off people’s heads”
Michelle Richardson: The Mad Hatter
Dean Manning: Alice

Well, down the rabbit hole with all of
you...we’ll see you in ajif.

The FD worker above places the finishing
touches on tone of the mushrooms.
Workers spend endless nights the week
before FD painting, constructing, and
transforming the gym into a fairy tale.
Although much of the detail goes
unnoticed by the majority of its
intoxicated admirers, those involved in the
decorations gain a great deal of
satisfaction from their hard work.

“There are so many details that
most people will never pay attention
to,” says Fegenbush. “But at least those
of us who work on it will know.”

Looking at the ball...

Fancy Dress Ball, W&L's
$80,000 answer to the high school
prom, brings a unique experience
to the social scene. While some
may disagree about the number of
students who attend, no one will
contest the perty atmosphere
which prevails over campus.

"FD is unique because of the
hundreds of thousands of dollars
that are spent in total by all the
participants by the time it is all
over. The fact that that kind of
money is spent is mind-boggling."
—Ethan Krupp, junior.

While many get caught up in
the frills of their dresses and the
capacity of their ﬂasks, one can
overlook the multitude of bands
tooting their horns throughout the
weekend.

"I'm conﬁdent that Coolio is
going to put on a good show. I
think Coolio and Skee-lo are the
highlights of FD this year. Next
year, we need Dr. Dre and TuPac."
-Byron Burns, sophomore.

''I'm excited about all the

and the list of bands playing Sat-

Felton, freshman.

Looking at Wonderland...

Providing plenty of atmo-
sphere and opportunity for cre-
ative theme-related pre-parties, "A
Mad Tea Party" allows student to
fancy themselves as characters in
a weekend full of childhood magic.

"Alice in Wonderland has al-

Looking for advice...

Although FD's primary pur-

potential fun of the event.

Co-editor, Phi supplement

For freshmen, FD can be as foreign
and scary as the first days of school.

Without an orientation committee or a
small group support system, how will the
freshmen possibly survive the three+ days
of extravaganza?

In the halls of the library, the carrels of
the C-school and booths in the Co—op lurk
experienced upperclassmen, willing to dis-
patch their FD wisdom to the naive fresh-
men.

Most likely, those who are planning to
attend this weekend's events have already
found dates. But for those of you who
pulled the typical "Wednesday-night-be-
fore-the-function-grab -a-date" and failed,

Frats must provide
sober drivers for FD

BY SARA MCCRONE
Phi Staff Writer

Not only will frat members be re-
sponsible for making sure guests and
their dates have a good time at their
parties this weekend, but they also have
to make sure that they get home safely.

Live Drive, a student-run program
that provides rides for those who cannot
drive safely themselves, does not have
enough volunteers to cover the 10:00 pm
- 2:00 am shifts on Wednesday, Friday,
and Saturday night.

“We are counting on fraternities to
provide their own rides since we need
volunteers [for Live Drive],” said Meg
Kinder, one of the students who was
instrumental in setting up the program.

Five volunteers work on a typical

party night; one student receives calls in
the University Center while four others
drive their own vehicles to pick up call-
ers. Kinder said that Live Drive receives
ﬁfteen calls on an average night, and
volunteers have been able to respond to
the demand.

“The response has been positive so
far,” Kinder said. “It involves a behav-
ioral change with the student body, and
we expect to see the demand increase.”

Kinder said that some may have
been confused about the Live Drive num-
ber, which is an on—campus number at
462-4055. She encouraged anyone- in-
dependent or Greek- to call her at 463-
6371 to volunteer to drive his own car for
Live Drive and said that there are leader-
ship positions available for the 1996-
1997 school year.

blind dates are not always the answer.

"lt's better to go with a friend than
someone you don't know," says junior Vic-
tor Lamas.

At this point, though, all your friends
of the opposite sex have dates, right? Well,
you can always go stag.

''I think that people shouldn't be afraid
to go by themselves if they want to go," says
Betsy Howe, a sophomore. "No one cares
if you have a date or not- well, at least l
don't."

Junior Marie Lamb remembers her
freshmen year when she invited a friend
from home whom she was dating.

"lt was a really, really long weekend,"
she said. "The donns are small places- I
think my roommate got pretty sick of him."

Every year, stories circulate about the
amount of alcohol consumed before, after,

and during
the Ball.

those who drank too much sim-

something about having a good
time, while their friends relate
the real story.

"Don't pass out before the
Ball," senior Phil Carrott sug-
gests. ''I know someone who did
that three years running— he didn't
like that."

Sophomore Claudia Arcuri
agrees that toleration is the key to
enjoying the actual Ball.

"Make it to the Ball- it's a
big plus," Arcuri, a steering com-
mittee member, advises.

She also cautions against
stumbling into professors in your
slightly altered states of mind.
Although it could provide for
some interesting comments in
class on Monday, it could also lead to
embarrassment and endless humiliation.

An intoxicated junior last year offered
his ﬂask to all of his professors- an action
for which he still receives harassment and
mocking.

gentlemen are experts in ballroom dancing,
accidents can still occur.

Senior Gretchen Hall unfortunately
found out that the dance floor is not the only
place for exposure.

" If your date is wearing a short dress,
don't pick her up for pictures," she says,
remembering the incriminating Party Pics
of herself.

FD, despite the high risk factor for
embarassment, is a party few will forget (or
remember, depending on your blood-alco-
hol level). Upperclassmen, however, warn
against high expectations for the Ball.

W&L: this ain't no Gangsta's Paradise

BY JENNIFER MENDOCHA
Phi Staff Writer

1... 2... 3... 4...? That's about
as many Coolio songs as the aver-
age W&L student can name. Still,
an overwhelming number of them
plan to "get up" and "get down" to
the pavilion tonight for the much-
awaited concert.

When theStudent Activities
Board first announced that Coolio
was going to be the entertainment
for Fancy Dress weekend, reac-
tions ranged from enthusiasm to
dissatisfaction. After all, it seems
that Lexington more closely re-
sembles Wierd Al Yankovic's
"Amish Paradise" than the
"Gangsta's Paradise" of Coolio‘s
lyrics.

In spite of one student's opin-
ion that the selection of Coolio
was "wildly inappropriate for one
of the most conservative schools
in the U.S.," anticipation for the
concert is growing. Anyone with
as much fame as Coolio coming to
W&L is bound to attract attention.

Although Coolio may not be
the most popular artist on campus,
it seems as if most W&L students
havebeconeenthusiasticaboutthis
Thursday's performance.

Freshman Liz Meloy declares
that she is "thrilled with SAB's
selection of Coolio," though she
would have been even more elated
had the Beastie Boys been chosen.

Liz adds, "It sucked that tickets
were open to the townies so soon"

Elizabeth James,excited
about the Coolio concert, ex-
presses disappointment at its quick
sellout.

The 1800 available tickets
were able to be purchased for ﬁve
days by the W&L community,
and for only one day by outsiders.
The last ticket was sold on Mon-
day at 3pm.

Senior Ted Waters says that
he approves of the different sched-
uled performance at W&L, but
expresses some concern that
Coolio may be received by a less
than ideal audience, "given the
taste of most W&L students."

Elizabeth Huston, though ea-
gerly anticipating the concert,
adds, ''I wouldn't say that I own
his boxed set."

Director of Security Mike
Young says that three local police
officers will be added for the pur-
pose of maintaining security at
Thursday's performance. Al-
though Coolio had originally re-
quested the presence of metal de-
tectors and a search at the door.
Young informed them that these
measures were not feasible. In-
stead, signs will be posted to re-
mind those attending that they may
be subject to random searches.
According to Young, this proce-
dure is not out of the ordinary.

In spite of the fame resulting
from his 1994 Platium, Coolio re-
marks that ''I still hang with the
same people, still do the same

things.... life on the streets, regu-
lar life and everyday life, that's
reality."

GANGsTA’“s PARA

Perhaps Thursday's concert

will give us all a glimpse of the
reality which exists beyond W&L's
campus.
