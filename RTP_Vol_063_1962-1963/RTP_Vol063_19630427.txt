With the success of another S.I.P.A. weekend, we take
this opportunity on behalf of the university to congratulate
the department of Journalism and express our appreciation for
an invaluable service to W&L. We take great pride in the
contribution such a program makes to our prestige among high

schools throughout the South.

The success of S.I.P.A. brings to mind the ideal setting
W&L offers for such conferences. We are fortunate to have
one of the most attractive campuses in this part of the country.
Conveniently linked with this asset is the fact that we have with-
in blocks of the campus adequate housing facilities to accommo-
date an amazingly large number of visitors. The ease with which
we could provide for 1000 students this past weekend is some
indication of our facility resources.

Such a setting presents a perfect opportunity to fulfill an
important need both in our university and in this section of
Virginia. First, we would be fulfilling a need for ourselves in
that, though we have a fine academic standing, there are many
who have formed a mistaken image of W&L. This is particu-
larly true of neighboring girls’ colleges which see W&L only

on the weekends and thus get a

Secondly, we would be fulfilling a need for this part of Vir-
ginia—a need for closer communications among the colleges
of the area. Several colleges have recognized this need and have
responded to it. Hollins for a number of years has been con-
ducting a literary frestival. It draws outstanding speakers and
there is a high degree of participation among colleges of west-

ern Virginia.

“his year, the students of Randolph-Macon Women’s Col-
lege won wide acclaim for themselves by initiating a conference,
“Focus,” dealing with American culture. Sweet Briar College
sponsored on the same weekend a conference on “Religion and
the Arts” which was likewise successful. In each case, the pres-
tige of the sponsoring college was enormously boosted.

It is foolish for us to let such an opportunity slip any long-
er. If we are at all interested in such a possibility, thought and
preparation ought to begin this spring. We above all solicit
the patronage of such departments as English, history, political
science, religion, and philosophy which might help the student
body by sponsoring such a program.

This investment would be too rewarding to bypass. We
appeal above all to the student body; for if this plan is ever to
be realized, the initiative must come from the students them-
selves. Keep in mind that there is an amazing potential for such
a program and we lose so much by not exploiting it.

Personality The New Unit
In Economy Of Exchange

By JOHN KIRKLEY

People today have forgotten how
to love. Indeed many of us have nev-
er learned what love is, for love is
an art which we have ceased to ap-
preciate, understand, and teach. This
is the thesis of Erich Fromm’s The
Art of Loving.

Americans today live in a modern,
industrialized, market economy based
on the principles of efficiency, pro-
duction, and consumption. This is our
environment; it is the basie reality,
the backdrop around which we shape
our intellectual, emotional, and pro-
ductive capacities. And we mold
our children to fit this market ma-
chine.

Man is a malleable animal; he
can attain heights of intellectual,
moral, emotional, sensual, and
spiritual exaltation, or he can
fall into the abyss of degradation.
What the individual actually does
is largely determined by the socie-
ty in which he lives and by the
attitudes and responses he learns
from those nearest him.

In a market economy, one pays
for what one gets; for $2.50 one can
get a tie or a steak dinner; one
used to be able to get a soft drink
for a nickel; for one’s labor one
gets paid. The principle is exchange.
To consume, one must get; to get
one must produce or offer what an-
other wants; the cycle is continu-
ous.

And we carry the exchange prin-
ciple over into our personal affairs.
There is a “personality market” just
as there is a labor market, a factor
market, and a product market. Cer-
tain qualities are required for cer-
tain jobs; the salesman needs a
smile, confidence, and a sincerity of
manner; the manager needs efficien-

ey and the ability to carry out
tasks himself and motivate those
under him to do the same.

In dating, rushing, making

friends, and courting, one offers
a “personality package” of what-
ever pleasing qualities he is able
to muster or develop or sham.
The empahsis in business, on the
football field, and during marriage
is on teamwork, efficiency, and the
attaining of goals. One must learn

 

to “carry the ball’ ‘or “do his

share.”

There is a necessity in a market
system for developing many kinds
of equality. Many people must do
dull, routinized work; for this they
are rewarded with money so that
they can “have fun.” But the dull-
ness of the work kills imagination
and aspiration and often results in
lethargy. Many persons in our econ-
omy are functionally interchange-
able; this is not true in dating and
often in marriage, as it is on the
assembly line.

A common misconception in our
culture today is that love consists
in “falling in love.” When the bar-
riers of isolation suddenly fall be-
tween two people, they often ex-
perience their escape from separate-
ness and superficial knowledge of

the other, especially if it is acom-'

panied by sexual satisfaction, as “be-
ing in love” which is, to them, a nec-
essary and sufficient condition for
marriage.

Erich Fromm feels that real
leve, a love which is deep and
meaningful, is more like “standing
in” love. It is enduring and last-
ing. The reason for this is that
real love is an art which must be
learned, acquired, as is any other
art. “Love is the active concern
for life and the growth of that
which we love.” The active charac-
ter of love requires care, respon-
sibility, respect, knowledge.

Love for others is impossible with-
out self-knowledge and_ self-love;
yet the idea of self-love is regarded
as perverted or sinful by many. It
is only in the full knowledge of
oneself and of one’s existential iso-
lation and aloneness that one can

choose, intellectually, rationally, to} ~

relate himself to others and to his
world through love and work in a
creatively enlarging manner.

Dr .Fromm discusses several forms
of love: brotherly love, which is
for all men; motherly love, which
is completely giving and unselfish;
erotic leve, which is distinguished
from mere sex and gratification and
which is particular, based on a full
knowledge and acecptance of the

‘Old George’ To Receive
New Coat For Spring

“Old George,” who had to sur-
vive the long, cold winter garbed in
a protective cloth, will get a well-
deserved spring coat in a few days.
The 120-year-old statute of George
Washington which is atop of Wash-
ington and Lee’s Washington Hall
has been an object of concern to
university officials.
His eight-foot, four inch frame
began to show signs of the beatings
he took from the elements, wood-
peckers and capricious students. Last
fall university maintenance men de-
cided George deserved more than
another paint job (he’s had at least
75 coats).

They removed several pieces of
rotting wood, filled his body with

him with chemicals intended to pre-
serve his finely-detailed features.
Tough Decision
But factors delayed fitting George
with a brand new overall coat—bad
weather set in and a tough decision
on the best outer coat had to be
made.
Good weather is finally here and,
after considering many possibilities,
the university has reached a deci-
sion.
George will get a coat of neo-
prene-hypalon, a synthetic rubber-
plastic material that can be sprayed

By BILL LOWRY

Sunday night, over two hundred
people—both students and _ towns-
people—heard a group of New York
teenagers, members of the Hudson
Guild Settlement House speak on
the subject of racial integration.
Many questions were raised, but
perhaps the most important one was
asked by the President of the Club,
who, during a brilliant speech
asked, “Why is your school segre-
gated?”

In a celebrated editorial which
has appeared in the Ring-tum Phi
for the past two years, a W&L pro-
fessor has asked whether or not we
have the right to change the Honor
System, the implication being that
because of the great value contained
therein. I should, therefore, like to
ask a similar question concerning the
racial question: do we have the right
to maintain Washington and Lee as
a segregated institution?

Legally, of course, we are com-
pletely within our rights, as a
private college, to do what we
please. But morally, I would ser-
iously question anyone who feels
that we, as a supposedly “Chris-
tain” institution with our high
aims of academic freedom, have a
right to perpetuate what is per-
haps the greatest blight on the
American ideal of democracy. The
harm which this evil does can be
seen in the reaction in other coun-
tries, in the situation at Oxford, in
the gang wars in East Harlem, and
in the appalling crime rates of
Washington, D.C.

The group from the Hudson Guild
made it quite clear that integration
is no easy matter; we all have
prejudices, economic, racial, and in-
tellectual, and to get anywhere we
must admit these prejudices in or-
der to come to know ourselves, and
we must all recognize that first to
admit our prejudices, and then to do
something about correcting them can
only come with great difficulty. At
the same time, however, as long as
Washington and Lee remains segre-
gated, we are depriving ourselves of
any contact with those who can
make us face up to these questions
of prejudice; consequently, every
student generation which leaves
Washington and Lee is unequipped
to cope with a situation which is
becoming more and more common—
that of the integrated society.

Let us not, then, support racial
integration because it is some great
cause, or because it will change
our “image” abroad, important
though these factors may be. Let
us, rather, support it because, by
maintaining our segregated stand-
dards, we are being deprived of
the very kind of knowledge the
university exists to provide—that
of ourselves and of the world
about us, In not being allowed to

Change In Student Attitude |
Is Concern Of New Officers

By BILL BOARDMAN

Vice-President of Student Body

Now that the battle of the student
bedy elections is over and the smoke
is beginning to
clear, this would
seem to be a good
to examine
some of the prob-
) lems with which
these newly elect-
ed officers will be
» dealing.

The honor sys-
tem at Washing-
ton and Lee is
doubtlessly the
school’s most val-
ued asset. Without such a system
W&L could not have attracted pro-
fessors of such high calibre, many
of whom would leave should it
ever be abolished.

Along this line it is well to ex-
amine the change which is overcom-
ing our campus. In the minds of
many, the election of the Progres-
sive Party candidates represents a
change. This could be a valid point,
but is such a change necessarily bad?

 

other races, we are being denied
a most fundamental right—that of |
knowing people, as they are, not |

them to be.

We must further recognize that.
integrating Washington and Lee |
will be no easy task. It is no secret
that much of our endowment is
based on segregationist money, and|
that, when integration occurs, Wash- |

ii

ington and Lee will stand to lose:

A Transitional Period
Washington and Lee although some |
two hundred years old is passing
through a transitional period. We
are beginning to gain the standards
of intellectual performance that a
student body and faculty such as
ours are capable of attaining. Many
members of the student body and
alumni are concerned W&L may be-
come a school for eggheads and
liberals. Yet all one needs to do
to be reassured this is not the long
range goal of our administration is
to confer on this subject with these
gentlemen. It seems to me that their
goal is to push Washington and Lee
to the highest intellectual level
while continuing to produce the
well-rounded liberal arts graduate.
In my opinion there is another
shift overtaking W&L which is of a
much more important nature than
this moderate one in academic stand-
ards.
Change in Attitude
The change to which I refer is a
change in attitude on the part of
the student body. Our faculty has
the ability to help us to become

Most important of all, however, is)
our obligation to know people of

too can be done in Lexington right.

well educated men, but there is a
vast difference between a well edu-
cated man and a well educated
gentleman, At Washington and Lee,
however, there seem to be factions
which would let the valued tradi-
tions of gentlemanly conduct. slip
by the wayside. These people criti-
cize our honor system, contending it
is idealistic and does not fit in with
the modern American way of life.
They criticize our tradition of con-
ventional dress contending that no
one can dictate another’s appearance.
Four Short Years

In view of our transient stay of
four short years, what gives us the
right to tamper with the basic foun-
dations of these traditions which
have endured for so long a time?

It is this attitude change rather
than an academic one that challenges
the newly elected officers. They must
take a firm stand on issues to see
these traditions are preserved.

The student body officers for next
year are surely capable individuals
with the ability and desire to give
you an excellent year of student
government.

time, however, we might well ask
ourselves how much money we
have lost by not being integrated.
Such a change in our policies would
indeed be a gamble, but a gamble
well worth taking, in the light of the
policies of such groups as the Ford
Foundation. If we are to be re-
sponsible students, we must insist
that Washington and Lee takes this
step.

In addition, there are many
things that we as students can do
to prepare the way. First, of
course, we can let the powers that
be know how we feel on the mat-
ter, by keeping the question alive.
Much interest has been generated
by the talk Sunday night, and it
would indeed be tragic to let this
interest wane.

every student feel a deep sense of
shame and guilt. As white citizens

W&L Library Staff Plagued
With Flood Of Lost Articles

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Every year at the close of school,
Miss Martha Cullipher, the Refer-
ence Librarian at McCormick Biblio-
theeary (an archaic term which is
more fitting for McCormick than the
modern word) is swamped with the
clothing, books, and other sundry
goodies that departing students have
dumped or lost there before leav-
ing for the summer. And every
year, she has tried to fight this sit-
uation by posting a notice on the
library bulletin board listing all
the lost items and, if labeled, their
owners.

This stategem has thus far been
ineffectual because, of course, the
average W&L student is so fascinat-
ed with his library research that
he never notices such superfluous
trivia as lost clothes or notices. This
year, therefore, Miss Cullipher has
taken her campaign to the pages of
the Ring-tum Phi, and the follow-
ing is an example of what she means.

Lost Shorts

In 1961, the lost included: 16

raincoats, a felt hat, 2 sweaters,

 

2 jackets, and a top coat. The fol-
low year, there were 5 rain coats,

|7 jackets, 5 sweaters, a top coat, a

pair of galoshes, a pair of socks,
6 unbmrellas, a brief case, a Ber-
muda straw bag, and one pair of
shorts! This year’s total is not yet
known, but it definitely includes
several umbrellas, two fairly decent
sport jackets, and a pair of pants.
(Incidentally, this writer, for one,
is interested in just how pairs of
trousers and shorts were lost in the
library. What is going on over there
anyway?) In addition, about 50
books are dumped in the library an-
nually at the end of the year.
Pertinent Remarks

There are two pertinent remarks
to be made about this problem.
The first is that there are probably
a lot of students running around
here who are needlessly suffering
exposure and/or a depleated ward-
robe. The second is that it was very
rainy in 1961 whereas 1962 was rela-
tively dry—a _ conclusion _ easily
reached upon examination of the
respective raincoat tabulations.

For those intellectuals who deplore
the shallowness of journalism, the
moral of this story will be drawn

Lacrosse Team Succumbs, 13-4

The University of Baltimore
handed W&L a 13-4 loss yesterday.
Bad luck plagued the team from
the first minute when both Jay
Bowersox and Bruce Jackson were
injured and put out for the rest of
the game. The Stickmen held Bal-
timore to a 3-3 tie up to the half,
but Baltimore scored eight more
goals in the third quarter which
fairly well put the game out of
reach.

Generals Again Slaughter R.P.L.

By TOM CARPENTER
“oF. ly 2 LOU he ew
saying of the Washington and Lee |
baseball team as the Generals de- |
feated the Richmond club for the
second time this season here Friday
afternoon.

The Generals have won only three
games all year and two have been at
the expense of R.PI.

The hero of both games has been
Chris Wigert, southpaw sophomore
hurler, who is as efficient at the
plate as he is on the monnd. Wigert
was the winning pitcher in both
contests and in the more recent one
was the batting star.

Generals Score Seven |

The Generals wasted no time in
giving Wigert a lead as they came
through with seven runs in the first
frame. Eric Sisler started the rally
with a single, which was followed
by four errors on the next two bat-
ters accounting for two runs. Lou
Flanagan walked and Buck Rose
sacrificed. Howie Martin beat out
an infield hit to load the sacks.
Bob Taylor drew a free pass to
drive in another tally. Doug Davis
forced Flanagan at home for the
second out of the inning. Wigert
took three balls, and Coach Lyles
wisely had the take sign on. Wigert
ignored the sign and blasted a long
smash to right centerfield to clear
tne bases and give him a 7-0 mar-
gin to work with.

The winners added three more
runs in the sixth, after R.P.J. had
scored its first run on singles, by
Martin and Wigert, a double by
Sisler, and a single by Ashley Allen.

The visitors added two runs in

 

Cletis

   

 

the seventh, but the Generals got one
back on a walk to Rose, an error,
and a single by Davis.

The losers got their last three runs
in the eighth, while W&L also added
its last run in that inning on an
error, a forceout, and a double by
Flanagan.

For Wigert it was his third vic-| |

tory against a lone defeat. His five
RBI's also increased his team-lead-
ing total to 12. He also took over the
lead in the average department from

‘ Chuck Lane with a 429 mark. Lane

is hitting 390 after being shut out
for the first time this season.

The Generals were scheduled to. ith

play Camp Lejeune here yesterday, |
but were rained out. Tomorrow Old |
Dominion invades W&L for a game
scheduled for 3:15. Old Dominion
brings a 15-3 record into the game
and holds an 8-4 decision over the
Generals in an earlier game, which
was Wigert’s one defeat.

Debaters Win Four, Lose Four
In National Championships

In the National Debate Tourna-
ment held at West Point, N.Y.,
this past weekend, Washington and
Lee debators Bill Noell and Al
Eckes posted a record of four wins
and four losses.

Eckes and Noell’s showing was
not good enough to put them in the
final elimination rounds among the
top 16 teams of the 38 which were
present. They could be consoled,
however, by the fact that one of
the W&L victories came at the ex-
pense of Dartmouth, which went on
to win the tournament and thus
become national champions; and that
no Souther school finished with a
better record than Washington and
Lee.

The tournament was scheduled ac-

Futch To Speak
About Papacy

Dr. Jefferson Davis Futch, Assist-
ant Professor of History, will ad-
dress the International Relations
Club tonight, April 30, in duPont
Auditorium. The subject of Dr.
Futch’s lecture will be “Italy and the
Papacy in Post-War Europe.”

A new member of the faculty,
Dr. Futeh comes to Washington and
Lee from Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity where he received his AB in
General Humanities and his Ph.D. in
History. He spent two years in Italy
where he was able to do extensive
research in Italian political affairs.
Dr. Futeh is also a member of Phi
Beta Kappa and the Society for
Italian Historical Studies.

In his lecture, Dr. Futch will em-
phasize the foreign relations and
domestic politics of both the Italian
Republic and the Papacy since 1945.
He will also consider the relations
between these two governments.

The lecture will be held at 7:15
p.m. and the public is invited.

entire being of another; self-love,
which is the sine qua non of all
love; and the love of God, which
is really aceording to the Hindus,
the love of One, of each particular
individual as himself and also as
all men, the understanding of per-
fection and the divine in the self, in
others, and the material world.

The principle of love and _ the
principle of a capitalistic market
system are incompatible; yet it is
posible for individuals to maintain
their functional integrity within our
economic system and _ still become
loving, creative persons.

cording to the power match prin-
ciple, according to which the top-
seeded teams meet each other im-
mediately, and the winning teams
are rematched against each other.
The W&L pair, who won three and
lost only one on the first day,
therefore had to face the tourney’s
strongest teams on the second day.
In this competition, easily the
stiffest of their careers, Noell and
Eckes lost three of the last four de-
bates.

They scored wins over Dartmouth,
Army, Kansas State, and the Uni-
versity of Kansas. Losses were at the
hands of St. Olaf, Boston College,
Wayne State, and Iillinois State.
The University of Virginia won
three and lost five contests at the
meet.

Debate director William Chaffin
called the tournament the best effort
he has seen from a Washington and
Lee team. It was the first W&L
appearance ever at the national
championships, a visit which was
earned when Noell and Eckes placed
second in the middle Atlantic elimi-
nation tournament last month.

 

The Student Service Society held
elections for next year’s officers last
Tuesday night, April 22. The pur-
pose of this organization is to show
visitors and prospective students
around the campus of Washington
and Lee. Chosen as officers for next
year were Ken Lane as President,
Jim Watlenstein as Vice President,
and Dick Kreitler as Secretary.

Ken Lane, apart from his services
on the SSS, will be editor of the
Friday edition of the Ring-tum Phi
for 1964-64 .Throughout his years at
W&L he has consistently been on
the Dean's List. He is an active
member of the University Christian
Association, and has served as a
Freshman Dormitory Counselor this
year.

Nine New York

A group of nine New York City
teenagers discussed the problems
of racial prejudice Sunday evening
in the parish hall of the R. E. Lee
Memorial Church, before a capacity
audience of students and towns-
people. The discussion was spon-
sored by ReVue and the Washington
and Lee Department of Sociology.

The Interemeler Club of the Hud-
son Guild Neighborhood House,
which presented the program, is an
integrated group of high school and
college students from the Chelsea
section of New York City.

The Club was formed eight months
ago for the purpose of erasing racial
and ethnic prejudice prevalent in
Chelsea through interracial dialogue
and personal contact.

Peter Zelin, a nineteen-year-old
freshman at Long Island University
and President of the Club, urged
those present to overcome their
prejudices by attempting “to know
people as people, and not as stereo-
types.”

A suggestion by Mr. Zelin to the
effect that students at Washington
and Lee and VMI might be “memor-
izing more than really learning and
understanding the democratic prin-
ciples upon which America is sup-
posedly founded” was warmly re-
ceived by the audience.

A question and answer period
followed Mr. Zelin’s talk in which
such issues as intermarriage, pri-
vate property rights, and the rela-
tive merits of gradualism as opposed
to immediate social change were
discussed .

The Club was brought to Lexing-
ton through the efforts of Miss Kath-
erine Dunham, a well-known chore-
ographer and author, and by Jay
Taylor, instructor in Romance Lan-
guage at Washington and Lee and

type of _ intellectual...“Whatever
you can lose, you should reckon of
no account” (Publilius Syrus, Max-
im 184, 42 B.C.). Finally, if you are
neither literary nor casual, Miss
Cullipher says that this year, all ef-
fects deposited in the library at the
end of the year will be “disposed
of,” so if you are missing a pair of
pants, you’d better go to the library
right away and claim them.

THE CURSE OF TIIE CAMPUS: NO. 2

As was pointed out last week, one would think that with all
the progress we have made in the education game, something
might have been done by now about roommates. But no. The
roommate picture has not brightened one bit since Ethan
Goodpimple founded the first American college.

(Contrary to popular belief, Harvard was not the first. Mr.
Goodpimple started his institution some 75 years earlier. And
quite an institution it was, let me tell you! Mr. Goodpimple
built schools of liberal arts, fine arts, dentistry, and tanning.
He built a lacrosse stadium that seated 102,000. Everywhere
on campus was emblazoned the stirring Latin motto CAVE
MUSSI—“Watch out for moose.” The student union contained
a bowling alley, a clock, and a 16-chair barber shop.

(It was this last feature—the barber shop—that, alas,
brought Mr. Goodpimple’s college to an early end. The student
body, — from the nearby countryside, was

com

equots and Iroquois who, alas, had no 7.
barber shop. They braid their hair instead of cutting it, and as
for shaving, they don’t. The barber, Tremblatt Follicle by name,
grew so depressed staring all the time at 16 empty chairs that
one day his mind finally gave way. Seizing his vibrator, he ran
outside and shook the entire campus till it crumbled to dust.
This later became known as Pickett’s Charge.)

But I digress. We were discussing ways for you and your
roommate to stop hating each other. This is admittedly diffi-
cult but not impossible if you will both bend a bit, give a little.

I remember, for example, my own college days (Berlitz, ’08).
My roommate was, I think you will allow, even less agreeab!
than most. He was a Tibetan named Ringading whose native
customs, while indisputably colorful, were not entirely endear-
ing. Mark you, I didn’t mind so much the gong he struck on
the hour or the string of firecrackers he set off on the half-hour.
I didn’t even mind his singeing chicken feathers every dusk and
daybreak. What I did mind was that he singed them in my hat.

To be fair, he was not totally taken with some of m
either—especially my hobby of collecting water. I h
at the time and just had to stack the water any-old-where.

Well sir, things grew steadily cooler between Ringading and
me, and they might have gotten actually ugly had we not each
happened to receive a package from home one day. anes
opened his package, paused, smiled shyly at me, and offe

bits
no jars

“Thank you,” I said. “What is it?”
“Yak butter,” he said. ‘You put it in your hair. In Tibetan

“Well now, that’s mighty friendly,” I said and offered him a
gift from my package. “Now you must have one of mine.”

“Thank you,” he said. “What is this ealled?”’

“Marlboro Cigarettes,” I said and held a mateh for him.

He puffed. “Wow !” he said. “This sure beats chicken feathers!”

“Or anything else you could name,” I said, lighting my own

And as we sat together and enjoyed that fine flavorful
Marlboro tobacco, that pure white Marlboro filter, a glow of
good fellowship came over us—a serene conviction that no
quarrels exist between men that will not yield to the warmth of
honest good will. Iam proud to say that Ringading and I re-
main friends to this day, and we exchange eards each Christmas
and each Fourth of July, firecrackers.
