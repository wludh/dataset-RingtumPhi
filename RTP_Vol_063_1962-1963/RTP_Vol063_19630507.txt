the Dance Board Committee are ex-
tremely pleased that Steve has been
elected as vice-prsident next year.
He has shown fine qualities in his
work on the dance sets this year and
we are positive he will do a great
job next year.”

He added, “I would also like to
commend the fine work put in this
year by the other candidates. They
are all due a great deal of praise.”

The candidates submitted their
plans for the coming year to the
Dance Board Committee Wednesday

and the board made its decision
yesterday.
Next year John Moore will be

president of Openings, Randy Woot-
ton of Fancy Dress, Dillard Mun-
ford of Springs, and Ken Lane of

Pace Picks At Peck’s Role
In ‘To Kill A Mockingbird

By TOM PACE
Movie Columnist

“To Kill a Mockingbird” is at the |

State Theater now, and will play
for a week.

Although there are many good
things about this film, there are

some things which
are not so good.
Being negative by
nature, I will be-
gin by enumerat-
ing the bad.
Gregory Peck
will do fine for a
starter. I can think
of no other actor
more overrated by

 

' the mass of the

Tem wean nation’s movie
goers. Peck has

two expressions; one for joy, love,

and passivity, and the other for sor-
row, anguish, hate, despair, anger,
apprehension and whatever else is
called for.

The difference in these two ex-
pression is a slight curling of the
mouth. Peck is certainly one of the
most ineffectual actors in films
now, and his portrayal of Atticus
Finch is stolid, uninteresting, and
unconcerning,. To think that he re-
ceived the Academy Award for

|

 

this performance reflects severely
on both the Academy's taste, and
their truly democratic process of
election.

Next, I'm almost afraid
is Mary Badham, the little Birm-
ingham girl who plays Scout. Her
point of view is used in telling the
story. This non-professional little
actress proves only that she is no
more apt than any other eight-year-
old pretending to be something she
isn’t. Time after time, whether she
is supposed to be gay, afraid, serious,
or sad, she keeps acoy expression
on her face that seems to be saying,
“Aren’t I cute?” Okay, I give her
that much, She is cute. Unfortunate-
ly, she is not Scout, and not an ac-
tress.

to say,

The sereenplay by Horton Foote
is in excellent taste. Except for his
overdramatization of the trial, Foote
is adequately loyal to the novel. His
dialogue is generally very good.

Director Robert Mulligan handles
the film sucessfully. He keeps the
mood subdued and peaceful, and
honestly impressed me that here was
a real southern town, with, for the
most part, real southern people, I
left the theater, my overall impres-
sion being that I had a very pleasant

than 250 athletes in the College Ath-
letic Conference’s first Spring Sports
Festival.

The five member colleges and uni-
versities will be competing for the
championships in the conference’s
four spring sports—baseball, golf,
tennis, track and field. Highpoint
of the two-day meet is the general

conference championship which goes |
to the school with best overall rec-|

Body Split On Lamb’ s Proposal

_ \Majority Of Those Polled

Favor Modifying System

Polling a cross-section of about
10) students Thursday resulted in
an almost 50-50 split opinion over
Lemar Lamb’s proposed change in
the Honor System penalty.

About 80 per cent of the persons
polled, however, were in favor of
modification of the Honor System
as it now stands.

While the freshmen seemed widely
in favor of the proposal, real class-
wide opinions didn’t emerge in the
upper three grades; sophomores,
juniors and seniors seemed split
evenly on the proposal as Lamb has
stated it. Nearly « everyone, however,

Glee Cha
Ends Season

Successfully

By GENE HATFIELD

The Washington and Lee glee club
concluded its “most successful” sea-
son last week with the election of
officers. Jim Mell, a three-year vet-
eran, was chosen to lead the organ-
ization next year as president.

Others elected to offices were Jere
Cravens, business manager, Rich
Hartgrove, secretary, Larry Meeks,
treasurer, Gordon Archer and Gene
Hatfield co-publicity chairmen, and
Maurice Fliess and Wicky Stewart,
librarians.

In terming this year as the organ-
ization’s “most successful,” Mr. Rob-
ert Stewart, director, cited the club’s
two tours to Atlanta, Georgia, and
Wilmington, Delaware, in addition to
the group’s regular appearances in
the local area.

Plans for next year include a trip
to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and
another trip with possible destina-
tions being Louisville, Kentucky or
Cincinnati, Ohio. The final decision
will be based in large measure on
where the club can do the university
most good in the field of public re-
lations.

Also planned are two concerts with
area girls’ schools. A concert at
Sweet Briar has been definitely ar-
ranged and a date with another
school, possibly Randolph-Macon, is
being worked on.

The organization's second record
is to be cut this summer from tapes
of past concerts. It will be the fol-
low-up to the club's first record, the
Sixties—Vol. I, still on sale at the
University Book Store. A major por-
tion of the record will be devoted to
show tunes.

Approximately 15 new members
will be needed to fill out the club for
next year’s activities. Upperclassmen
will be given preference over incom-
ing freshmen. Any upperclassman
interested should see Mr. Stewart
sometime between now and semester
exams for an audition. No previous

 

experience is necessary.

Selections to be added to the club’s |
repertoire for next year will include |
a number of Gilbert-Sullivan tunes, |
a French drinking song and seve ral
fun and novelty songs.

 

felt the present system needs change.

Non-fraternity students polled ap-
peared to be about 80 per cent for,
20 per cent against the standing pro-
posal.

Two persons polled, a freshman
fraternity member and a non-frater-
nity senior, favored complete aboli-
tion of the Honor System.

An attempt was made by the Fri-
day Ring-tum Phi to poll propor-
tional numbers of Southerners and
Notherners, fraternity and non-fra-
ternity men, and equal numbers of

persons in each class.
Those polled were asked (1) if
they favored Lamb’s proposal and

(2) if not, whether they thought
some change in the standing system
was necessary.

While tthe first question got an al-
most equal number of pro and con
answers, students felt that the system
as it stands is inadequate.

About five per cent of the persons
polled indicated they thought the
system is now “based on fear.”

Several felt the system is a fear
system because of the secrecy sur-
rounding it, and advocated increased
explanation of just what does and
does not constitute a violation.

A number of students, notably
juniors and seniors, said the system
should be codified further in order
to let the student know more about
the EC’s definition of honor.

Approximately 15 per cent of the
students questioned opposed Lamb's
plan because they felt, in a junior’s
words:

“We need to think about this some
more. Something definitely needs to
be done to improve the present pen-
alty, but we ought to think about it
longer before coming up with such
a rigid plan (as Lamb’s). Lamar’s

Seales Banquet
Set May 15

By KEN McGRAW

The Washington and Lee Alumni
Association will hold its annual ban-
quet in honor of the graduating
seniors at 6:30 p.m., Wednesday, May
15th, at Evans Dining Hall. All aca-
demic and low seniors as well as
those who will graduate in February,
1964, are invited to attend.

The program will consist of a per-
formance by the Sazeraes, and talks
by University President Fred C.
Cole and Alumni Association Execu-
tive Secretary, William C. Wash-
burn. The high point, however, will
be the presentation of the first Frank
J. Gilliam award to an outstanding

senior. The Executive Committee is
in charge of this presentation.
Mr. Washburn stated that the

banquet is given by the Alumni As-
sociation as a token to the gradu-
ating seniors. The Alumni Associa-
tion, he added, wants to welcome
them as alumni and to impress on
them their privilege as well as their
responsibility as alumni of Washing-

Troubs Feature Four One-A ct Plays
Produced And Directed B y Students

By CHARLES NEWMAN

and JERRY COFFMAN
Thursday night the Troubadours
presented two one-act plays, Chee-
Chee and Purgatory, The plays will
be repeated Saturday night at 8:30
in the Troubadour Theatre. These
plays, along with two _ presented
Wednesday night and repeated to-
night, The Apollo of Bellac and
Krapp’s Last Tape, are the third and
last productions for the Troubs this

year.
Chee-Chee, written by Luigi Pi-
sandello, is a comedy which deals

with a high-class con man who ends
up with the money and the girl. The
play is the kind you expect to see
when you go to a production of this
type, but due to the acting of Charles
Bright, the play doesn‘t drag to the
presupposed ending.

All these plays
students who are

directed by
advanced di-

are
in

 

recting courses; in the case of Chee-

Chee the director is Charles C. Flip-
pen,
The second paly, Purgatory, by

William Butler Yeats, is a poetic dra-
ma Although the play is rather short,
it is an excellent production. The
stage setting is well-designed, well-
decorated, and effective, but the
complete success of the production
must be credited to the superb act- |
ing of Starke Sydnor. The play pre-

 

sents a conflict between the tradi-
tions of the old and the changing
ways of the new. Sydnor portrays

the Old Man who experiences a liv-|
ing “purgatory,” caused by his past |
and present deeds. The play is cap-
ably directed by John R. Dunnell.
The plays Friday and Saturday |
night will begin at 8:30. Reservations

Che Ring-tum Phi

Friday Edition

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Let Us Remember

The past two issues of the Ring-tum Phi have had editorial
columns filled with arguments and counter-arguments debating
our Honor System. It has caused many people to stand up for
what they believe and make an evaluation of their standards.

A very ugly and base threat has risen out of this, however,
that goes beyond these questions which have been brought
forth. The very freedom of the press has been questioned
by members of the student body, and attempts have been made
to suppress divergent ideas.

We submit that those who attempt such moves should stop
and re-evaluate themselves and their beliefs. If one does not
agree with a new idea, that is his privilege, but the supporters of
that idea have a right to be heard. After this idea is heard, it
can be discussed, defended, or rejected. Attempts at suppres-
sion, however, have no place in our society and suggest a basic
weakness in the argument of the “suppressor” when they are
attempted.

It is good to remember Thomas Jefferson’s words: “No
government ought to be without a censor; and where the press
is free, none will ever be.

We must all remember that a newspaper is more than
a report or feature, it is more than an entertaining project. It
is a means of betterment. It cannot be denied its rights of ex-
pression. Again, in the words of Jefferson, ‘when the press is
free and every man is able to read, all is safe.” We hope that
this is never forgotten.

A Lament

It was ironic to read the following statement which appeared
in the editorial written by Lanny Butler in last Tuesday’s paper:
“The editors of the Tuesday edition do not consider the Honor
System a Sacred Cow, and welcome discussion of Mr. Lamb’s
proposal.” In light of Butler’s actions one week ago today, this
statement is not only ironic, but hypocritical.

For three hours last Friday morning, Butler, along with
other EC members, attempted to remove the editorial in that
edition which endorsed Lamar Lamb’s proposal to modify the
permanent expulsion penalty of our Honor System. He failed
in this objective because, as Editor of the Tuesday edition, he
has no jurisdiction over the Friday paper.

Upon his failure to suppress discussion of Lamb’s proposal,
Butler threatened to have Lamb withdrawn from the Pro-
gressive Party slate of candidates. He also failed in this attempt.
Over the past weekend, popular support for Lamar Lamb’s
proposal grew tremendously. It was endorsed fully by EC man
Meade Christian. Individual support increased. The possibility
that our Honor System could be improved was the talk of
Washington and Lee.

Then, at 5 p.m. last Monday, the EC met to consider some
final measure which might suppress the growing support for
Lamb. In its most devious move to date, the EC then passed a
resolution by a 10-2 vote which was read during the nominating
conventions that night—it was a statement politically slanted
against Lamb’s proposal. This action was not only unfair, but
also hypocritical. The EC men who read the statement con-
cluded it with the assurance that it was not an attempt to in-
fluence voting. This riduculous statement met with laughter
and loud boos in the sophomore convention.

Individual members of the EC have done their best to
deny to this edition of The Ring-tum Phi and to individual
students the right of question and criticism. Ten of the twelve
members of the EC have been unable to recognize the fact
that a system is fallible by definition. But by burying their
heads in the proverbial sand, these EC men have literally dei-
fied the Honor System. They consider it absolutely perfect.
And yet they used every tactic in their power to snuff out criti-
cism of this perfect system—apparently they felt (last week,
at any rate) that our Honor System is quite fragile. It might
break when subjected to careful scrutiny.

These ten members of the EC have missed the point of
Lamar Lamb’s proposal altogether. Though they criticize
supporters of the proposal for failing to think sufficiently about
it, sadly enough they themselves have never seriously consider-
ed the suggestion which they have rejected. This is proved in
the following editorial. Ten members of the EC are so obsessed
with the infallibility of a system that they are unable to see
either its criticism or its critics.

This is sad, for blind men are very sad indeed.

0.5.7.4. 18%

A Sacred Cow...
But No Bull Today

Those members of the Executive Committee who are most
opposed to the suggested change in the administration of our
Honor System have tried, more than anything else, to blur
the central issue. The most outstanding example of this ten-
dency to date is the editorial written by Lanny Butler which
appeared in last Tuesday’s paper. He carefully stepped all
around Lamar Lamb’s proposal, without ever actually confront-
ing it.

It is important to realize that what Lamb’s proposal suggests
is not the abolition of the present absolute penalty, as Butler

contends; rather, it does suggest that within the framework of
the Honor System some provision should be made to allow
a convicted individual to be considered for re-admission.
The proposal does not advocate a blanket one-year penalty.
Flagrant or deliberate violators obviously acting in cold and
calculated abuse of the Washington and Lee code of honor,
would be permanently dismissed, as is now done. In the case
of a student whose violation indicated mitigating corcumstances
(such as extreme emotional instability induced temporarily by
family or other problems, or such as ignorance of the letter of
the Honor System), then—under amb’s proposal—that stu-
dent might be considered for a less than permanent expulsion.

Thus, the proposal does not assure a violator of re-admit-
tance, nor does it obligate the EC to penalize all violators with
a one-year expulsion. It does allow for the possibility that a
student guilty of an honor violation is also an honest person.
No member of the EC can claim with honesty that every con-
victed student has deserved what he got under our present
system of permanent expulsion. Under Lamb’s proposal, the
EC would have a power in addition to that which it has now:
it could offer the basically honest violator an opportunity to live
down his mistake, and thereby re-build his reputation.

We look now at Lanny Butler’s arguments against this

proposal:
1. He stated that Lamb “manages to conclude that students
who are convicted of an Honor System violation cannot get
into other schools, a conclusion which is false.” Certainly the
conclusion is false. Lamb has never contended that violators
get into any other schools. He has contended that they cannot
get into schools comparable to W&L in academics and prestige.
The instances are rare indeed, according to administration of-
ficials, when violators here get into good institutions.

2. For Butler to say that the Honor System does not oper-
ate, under the present penalty, on the assumption that a per-
son once dishonorable is always dishonorable would be laugh-
able if it weren’t so pathetic. The present system says that a
convicted violator may never again become a part of the Wash-
ington and Lee community. Why? Because he is dishonorable.
If he is not dishonorable forever, then why ban him forever?

In the academic community at W&L, the violator is pre-
sumed irrevocably dishonorable—there is not even the admis-
sion of the possibility that he could adhere to the code of honor
within the environment in which he has been labeled dishonor-
able. For the rest of that convicted person’s life, whether he is
applying to another college or trying to get a job, W&L must
faithfully report that he was dismissed from school here due to
an honor offense. This may be justice in the case of the fla-
grant violator; we are concerned, however, with the student
who committed no heinous violation, who is basically honest,
but who was expelled because of a violation of the letter of the
law. And these cases have existed and they will in the future,
unless a change is made.

3. Butler next criticized ‘‘Lamb and his coterie” (see Letters
to the Editor) for evoking the Christian idea of forgiveness,
which Butler apparently feels just complicates the issue. It
might be idealistic to say that the honorable man should also
be a compassionate man—but so is it idealistic to claim that
there are 1,000 people at W&L abiding by a code of honor
out of an overwhelming obsession with purity.

Butler indicates that other schools, after having instituted
graduated penalties, witnessed the downfall of their honor sys-
tem. Perhaps, but in other schools such graduated penalties
may well have been instituted as a last desperate attempt to
save already floundering systems, This, hopefully, is not the
case here.

4. We shall now discuss what Butler calls ‘the clincher’’:
Lamb’s statement that the present penalty was instituted only
thirty years ago. We regret that Butler, before he unknowing-
ly called this statement “completely false,” did not take a few
minutes to check into the matter. Lamb did. According to
Lamb, penalties other than the present one were invoked as late
as 1936; while he, as an EC member, is unable to reveal speci-
fic instances or cases to the general student body, he assures us
that there were convicted honor violators who received less
than the present penalty. Perhaps Student Body Secretary
Butler should mull over past EC minutes.

The ten EC men who have fought so vigorously against
Lamar Lamb’s proposal are opposed basically to the word
“change.” They have voted against it almost invariably all
year long. We do not support change in itself—we support
an idea which has great merit. It is time that we all rise above
a petty opposition to the mere idea of change, and see if this
particular proposed change would be valuable to our Honor
System. Rather than corrupt our system, as some EC men
have charged, we believe that this proposal, if adopted, would
strengthen the system. What will weaken the system, con-
versely, is for it to remain exactly as it is now for any great
length of time.

Meade Christian

Dear Sir:

The title of Tuesday's Ring-tum
Phi editorial unfortunately implied
that those who support Lamar
Lamb’s proposal of reinstatement
make up the anti-Honor System
while those who disagree are the
Honor System’s protectors. As I have
stated previously, this proposal is
not aimed at the destruction of the
System, nor do I believe that des-
truction would be the result.

What I am certain of, however,
is that the policy of automatic ex-
pulsion without the hope of re-
admission creates a_ conflict of
values tht has plagued me as an
EC member throughout the year.
I do not understand the Tuesday
Editor's basis for labeling the
principle of forgiveness “improper-
erly used” in this regard, but if he
is referring to its impracticality,
then I would remind him that
there is much about Christianity
that is impractical and yet demand-
ed by those who accept it.

Of course there are many at Wash-
ington and Lee to whom this argu-
ment means little or nothing, and
to these I would like to explain
why this proposal may be quite
practical after all. From my exper-
ience I believe that there are few
premeditated honor offenses com-
mitted here. Most occur in a moment

student has not take time to famil-
arize himself with the rules as they
apply to a particular course. Since,
as the Tuesday editorial admits, such
an offense is no sign of permanent
dishonesty, what is wrong with al-
lowing the convicted student to re-
enter the community that banished
him and have an opportunity to
demonstrate that his mistake was
contrary to his true nature?

The reply to this proposal is
usually that such a policy would
bring the “downfall of the system.”
Although to my _ knowledge this
phrase has not been defined, I as-
sume that it deals with a loss of
respect for the Honor System in
the eyes of the students and a
heightened incentive to commit vio-
lations.

Whether or not the former fear
would materialize depends for the
most part, as it dees now, on the
way in which the Honor System is
presented to the student body by
the EC; and also it should be ob-
vious by now tht there are some
students whose respect for the sys-
would increase if such a change
were brought about.

As for the second feared reaction,
expulsion for one year and the loss
of face suffered with friends and
family are certainly more than a
smack on the hand.

In short, then, Lamar Lamb's pro-
posal seems to me both right and
practical. I think that there has
been much honest effort to be ob-
jective by those both for and against
Lamar’s proposal, and I sincerely
hope that the Executive Committee
of 1963-64 will carefully evaluate
all of the arguments put forth.

Dear Sir:

The question of changing our
Honor System has aroused a great
deal of controversy recently. The
arguments seem to revolve around
the justice of expelling a student
forever as a result of his breaking
a rigid code of honor. A_ student
convicted of lying. cheating, or steal-
ing is automatically forced to leave
school with no chance of returning.
This is a just rule in principle. The

 

 

of thoughtlessness or because the}

application of this rule, however,
is an area where discretion is neces-
sary.

During my four years at Washing-
ton and Lee I have not had the op-
portunity to serve on the Execu-
tive Committee. Therefore I can-
not speak with assurance concerning
Executive committee honor trials.
Nevertheless, I can imagine cases
in which students could technically
be guilty of an honor violation and
yet not deserve the punishment he
receives.

No one can deny that there are
many degrees of guilt. Students
make mistakes, are lazy, and often
downright stupid. This does not
mean, however, that they are dis-
honest; yet as a result of their
stupidity or laziness, they may in-
advertently lie, cheat, steal. What
chance do these students have
within such a system as ours?
Students who do not intentionally
lie, cheat, or steal should not be
punished as severely as the stu-
dent who intentionally does these
things,

Our Honor System was originally
established to protect the honest
students against those who inten-
tionally are dishonest. It was not
meant to become the mechanical
and technical abstract code that it
is today. The EC says intention can
not be determined. And yet in law
courts attempts are made to de-
termine the intentions of the ac-
cused. Punishmen is granted accord-
ing to the degree of intent in many
cases. If the members of our execu-
tive committee cannot determine
intention, they should not have the

Dear Sir:

Last Tuesday's editorial read well,
and I am sure that many points are
well taken. However, I for one, would
like to take issue with Mr. Butler on
a few points; for instance, the title:
“The Honor System Defended.” I
would like to ask from whom is he
defending it? Has anyone proposed
that we do away with it or change
its basic character in any way? No!

Let’s stop all our chattering for
a moment and examine exactly what
the proposal is. Persons convicted
of an honor offense will be auto-
matically expelled for one year and
will be eligible for readmission af-
ter one year, upon review of the case
by the EC. This does not guarantec
that he will be readmitted, it only
says he is eligible to be so. But if,
in the opinion of the EC, the student
does not merit readmission then he
will never be allowed to return to
W&L.

So perhaps for five years we
would go along without having any
cause to readmit a boy; and then
a case might come up which the
EC would consider an honor vio-
lation by convicting the student by
a two-thirds vote, then immediate -
ly recommend that the boy be
readmitted. We find ten of our

Sirs:

To say that the conviction that the
Honor System needs close examina-
tion and possible change is held by
only a few men on campus may
very well be true, though I person-
ally doubt it; but does this mean
that the conviction is wrong? Does
this means that the views of a few
should not be aired and discused and
that candidates who hold minority
views should be barred from run-
ning or expressing their ideas?

I can understand the position of
those who have valiantly and en-

Netmen Edged,
Ready For CAC

After a hard playing contest, the
varsity netmen of Coach Bill Wash-
burn finally succumbed to the Uni-
versity of Virginia 5-4 in a match
played in Lexington last Wednesday
afternoon. The individual totals were
all close as the match was still unde-
cided until the come-from-behind
victory of Virginia’s Bill Brown and
John Killebrew over the Generals’
John Baker and Lindsey Short, 5-1,
11-9, 6-2.

In the singles Washington and Lee
started off behind as Jim DeYoung
dropped the opening game 4-6, 2-6
to Bruce Farrel. John Baker made
up the deficit by disposing of Bill
Brown, 6-3, 6-3. With the score
knotted at one apiece, Randy Jones
put W&L out in front by a 6-1, 7-5
vietory over John Killebrew.

Trailing 2-1, the Wahoos won the
rest of the singles to establish a lead
that the Generals were not quite able
to overcome. Jom Mell was defeated
4-6, 3-6 by Ken Moorman; Lindsey
Short lost 3-6,5-7 to Jim Gilivee;
and Forest Dickinson was outscored
by Henry Wellwright, 4-6, 4-7.

Doubles Deciding Factor

Within the three doubles matches
remaining, W&L was behind 4-2, but
the Generals were not willing to
admit defeat although a sweep of
the doubles would be necessary for
a victory. Jim DeYoung and Randy
Jones dispatched the Virginia team
of Bruce Farrell and Ken Mooreman
6-2, 6-2 to keep the Generals in the
contest. Then came the heartbreak-
er. In the second doubles even, John
Baker and Lindsey Short met Bill
Brown and John Killebrew. The
Generals’ duo started well, winning

W&L plays host to the CAC tourna- |
ment on Friday and Saturday to
close out its 63 season. The teams
participating in the tournament will
be Centre College from Danville,
Kentucky, Sewanee (University of
the South) from Sewanee, Tennessee, ,
Southwestern University from Mem- |
phis, Tennessee, and Washington
U. from St. Louis, Missouri.

The system to be used is a
single elimination with a consolation
series to be played along with the}
finals on Saturday. Also on Saturday |
will be the selection of the all-con- |
shown good speed on his fast ball
two pitchers. It is hard to rate teams,
as W&L has played none of them
this season, but Washington U. seems
to be the favorite on its past record.

These will be the last games for
the fast finishing W&L squad. After
losing four games the Generals have
compiled a 4-7 record, and with
consistent hitting and good fielding
they could do very well.

Sisler Leads in Hitting

Four batters are presently hitting
over .300 and they are led by Eric

Sisler’s .452 average. Others over
.300 are sophomore pitcher Chris
Wigert with .360, captain Chuck

Lane with .347, and junior Martin
with an even .300. Wigert and Lane
are the leading power hitters with
two home runs each. One of the
few bright spots in W&L’s fielding
is first baseman Martin’s .987 fielding
average.

The big hopes for the Generals are
freshmen Bob Duckwall and Ed

right to judge a student’s guilt at
all.

Such a change as was proposed
by Lamar Lamb seems to be praise-
worthy for its attempt to come to the
heart of the problem. A_ student
technically guilty would not auto-
matically be faced with expulsion,
and with no chance to return. Cer-
tainly he may be able now to enter
another college, but in all prob-
ability one of a vastly inferior qual-
ity than Washington and Lee.

The principle of automatic ex-
pulsion as a result of a technical
violation is unrealistic, because it
fails to take into account the com-
plex nature of human actions, Out-
right lying, cheating, and stealing
is not distinguished from thought-
less—but not intentional—lying,
cheating, and stealing. As long as
our present Honor System remains,
it is likely that honest students
who have acted foolishly or rashly
or out of ignorance will be ex-
pelled for technically lying, cheat-
ing, or stealing. The awareness of
this possibility on the part of the
student is the cause of its being
called a fear system by many.

I cannot see how providing de-
grees of punishment would weaken
the Honor System as it now stands.
Instead it would base the system on
a more realistic awareness of a stu-
dent’s moral character.

present EC immediately blasting
the proposal. I wonder what makes
them so sure they are so right and
yet have such a lack of confidence
in future Executive Committees?

I hope from the above example
that you can see why this proposal
is not so radical, why honor viola-
tions will not become more preval-
ent, and why the Honor System will
not “degenerate into a strictly puni-
tive system.”

Washington and Lee’s purpose is
not to take 350 or so students a year,
weed out the dumb and dishonest,
and then graduate the remainder.
The dumb—and hopefully—the dis-
honest have been excluded by our
select admission policy. The purpose
of W&L is to prepare these 350
men for the society in which they
will live—true, sometimes we will
fail, but we must never stop striv-
ing for the ideal.

We don’t want to send our “bad
products” into society—we want to
endeavor to show them the way to
become “good products” and then
send them forth. I dare say that a
person that makes an honest mistake
and is allowed to redeem himself
will make a far more conscientious
effort to be that “good product” than
do many who never make that ini-
tial mistake here.

Society indeed has a “big prob-
lem with lying, cheating and steal-
ing.” It is up to us to add to that
problem as little as possible and do
what we can to alleviate it. One
embittered, frustrated, basically
very honest individual aids society
and W&L very little; a thankful
one can raise the name of W&L
and its honor system.

ideal” and yet Mr. Butler is “leery
of the practical applicability of for-
giveness.” I submit that there is a
conflict here, .and I hope I am al-
lowed the W&L position. There has
been only one person, to my know-
ledge, who never was guilty of lying,
cheating, or stealing at some point in
his life; and tht person is the foun-
dation of the Christian ideal. The
fundamental prayer of this Christian
ideal which He gave us tells us to
forgive others. I am not so idealistic
as to believe this principle has
practical, universal application; but I
do believe tht we could consider it
when we dismiss a boy from schoo
on an honor violation.

Let’s not automatically cast out a
boy forever; let’s not be quite so

humility and forgiveness to some

thusiastically appointed themselves
“defenders of the Honor System,”
as if someone wanted to destroy it;
for I, too, have stood up for our
code as it exists now against criti-
cisms of students in other schools.
(It is noteworthy that the criticism
of students from other schools has
centered around what I understand
to be the main issue of the present
proposal, the lack of provision for
possible forgiveness and a _ second
chanee.) I see no reason, however,
why one must resort to question-
able methods in this case to defend
something he believes is right.

I am in sympathy with the cur-
rent proposal to a degree: to a
great enough degree to be anxious
to see what comes of it. I am con-
fident that the new EC will give
careful and fair consideration to
this and other proposals and will
strive to reflect student opinion
rather than influence it. (I almost
used “dictate,” but that is a little
too strong, though only a little.)

I hope the EC will try to serve
the best interests of the student body
rather than that of tradition or per-
sonal views. With the lack, un-
fortunately, of a student senate, the
EC members must be representa-
tives of student views and not let
their personal prejudices rule them
in such situations.

is complete without a jealous wife
(Carolyn Bing), and her sharp
tongue coupled with her husband's
wit provides a chance for some fine
acting.

All in all the play was very en-
tertaining, and judging from the
audience’s applause, very well re-
i ceived. It was the type of play where,
|no matter how small or how large
| their part may have been, the entire

cast set out to please you, and the

result was an excellent perform-
; ance by all.
| “Krapp’s Last Tape,” directed by

Andrew E. Adelson, belongs, in his
| words, “to a recently developed
‘genre of drama termed ‘theatre of
{the absurd’ or ‘metatheatre.’ The
plays of Beckett are unique in that
they all concentrate on the same
subject: the passage of time and its
effects upon man,

Nowhere in Beckett is this idea
of lost time more emphatic than in
Krapp’s Last Tape. The solitary
Krapp plays a tape of his thirty-
ninth birthday, and the only thing
that interests him is a description
of love-making in a punt. Apart
from this, he finds no common
ground with his younger self. What
is the difference between the older
and younger Krapp? It is a dic-
hotomy affected by the passage of
time; it is time which prevents the
individual from every fully recaptur-
ing past evperience.”

Krapp is portrayed by Steve Col-
vin, and I have to admit that I
have never seen anyone peel and
eat a banana with as much relish
and as much zeal as he does. Colvin
was handicapped by the fact that his
performance was the second of the
evening, and after Giraudoux’s light
satire it was difficult at first to ad-
just one’s thoughts to the intensity
and subtle implications which mark
a play by Beckett. Yet, as the play
progressed, it became obvious that
the audience was at last receptive,
and Mr. Colvin’s role took on much
more meaning. His ability to trans-
mit an air of antiquity brought life
to the play, and it, too, was appre-
ciated greatly by the audience.

A Mixed Opinion Among

Students Here
(Continued from page 1)

idea might be the right one, but I
think we need to discuss it more and
maybe come up with some other
ideas, too.

A freshman favored the proposal,
adding tht he didn’t “like the idea
of the EC saying they can’t make
a mistake and that every violation
is just as bad as every other. Isn’t
that what they are saying now?”

A lot of students opposed to the
proposal said they felt it would
weaken the Honor System.

Said on senior:

“Sure the Honor System isn’t per-
fect; it’s got flaws like every other
human institution. But why take a
chance on losing a system that
works—and really works—just for

the sake of an isolated few guys? I;
think that 99 per cent of the students |

benefit immeasurably from the re-
sponsibility of living under an abso-

lute, demanding system like ours. It!

strengthens most people; even if at
first they obey it out of fear, they
learn after a while that obedience to
the system improves their character,
increases their self-respect, and gives
them all kinds of freedom. Then the
fear is replaced by something else—
awe, maybe. If it is really a fear
system, nobody could live under it
for four years and not either disobey
or go crazy.

“No, we aren’t going to get a per-
fect system, so let’s keep what we've
got. It’s pretty damn good as it is.”

There was generall agreement on
the fact that the issue should be con-
tinued. A few students suggested
a student body vote, but most of
them felt the issue hadn’t been ex-
plored fully enough yet. “Later I
think a vote would be a good idea;
now nobody’s really thought about it
enough,” commented one junior.

man player in the nation, is favored
to capture one of the meet’s indi-
vidual trophies. Centre’s Sue Staf-
ford should also provide interesting
and difficult competition.

Tennis play involving six singles
tournaments and three doubles tour-
naments began today at 8 a.m. Golf-
ers began 36 holes of medal play at
9 am. with the team championship
determined by the best aggregate
score.

Baseball competition started at 10
this morning and will continue un-
der lights with two games sched-
uled at Lexington’s recreation field.

Preliminaries and semi-finals of
the track field competition got un-
derway this afternoon. Finals are
scheduled for 1 p.m. Saturday.

 

For the spectator whose athletic
, interest is still not satisfied there
will also be a lacrosse game between
Loyola and W&L Saturday.

W&L enters competition with a
slight advantage, having won earlier
the football championship. The Bat-
tling Bears of Washington University
must also be counted on as heavy
favorites having won the basketball
trophy already.

At any rate, competition will be
tough for the President’s trophy, a
300 pound locomotive bell.

Netmen Play In Tourney
(Continued from page 2)
the first set, 7-5. The second set was
the day’s longest as the score ran to
9-9. The Wahoos took the next two
games and won the set 11-9. With
the third set going to Virginia 6-2,
W&L lost the event and the match.
Forrest Dickinson and Jim Mell de-
feated Virginia's Gilivete and Wat-
son, but it was anti-climatie as the
Generals had already lost the match.
This was the third loss for the
tennis squad, bringing the season
record to 5-3, with one game rained
out. the squad will carry this rec-
ord into the CAC tournament today.
The tennis matches in the tourna-
ment this weekend should prove to
be interesting. None of the competing
teams have met proior to today. The
| team that undoubtedly will be draw-
the greatest spectator interest will be
j that of Washington University of
| St. Louis. Tennis-minded students
at W&L have been looking forward
| to the appearance in the tournament
of Miss Carol Hanks, one of the
country’s best, but at Washington
she rates no better than fourth on
the squad. If this is any indication
of the quality of tennis to be played
today and tomorrow, the tournament
should prove exciting. At the con-
clusion of play the individual awards
will be presented as well as a trophy
for the team champion.
