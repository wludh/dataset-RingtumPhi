Faculty-Student Conference

To Discuss Ways Of Fraternity Improvement

Phillip Deane
Delivers Talk
On US And UN

Last Tuesday night Phillip Deane,
director of the United Nations In-
formation Center in Washington, told
some 75 students that the United
Nations “does not look toward a
world government.”

Mr. Deane, speaking under the
visiting scholars program of the
University Center in Virginia, lec-
tured in duPont Auditorium for
more than 90 minutes.

He stated that the U.N.’s_ pur-
pose is three-fold: (1) to serve
as a permanent peace conference,
(2) to aet as an economic consult-
ant to the world, and (3) to be
the “picker-up of messes.” In an
analogy he said, “If the world is
an apartment house, we are the
janitor.” The U.N. cleans the stairs,
keeps the fire regulations, and
helps when requested to do so.

The U.N.’s function as a peace
conference is, according to Deane,
necessitated by the need for a per-
manent club where enemies can
meet. He stated that the U.S. and
the U.S.R.R. have already tacitly
agreed that war is useless because
there would be no victors in World
War III, and that we are now only
quibbling about the wording of the
agreement. The role of the U.N. in
the negotiations is to keep the lines
of communication open.

In its role of economic consult-
ant Deane stated that the United
Nations “is in the business of help-
ing members who need help and
ask for it.” This aid is given, by
U.S. precedent, without regard to
the political situation in the re-
cipient country, and without po-
litical strings. Thus, he noted, the
U.N. special fund for agricultural
aid to Cuba is entirely in keeping
with this established policy. U.S.
objections to the fund are based
on the dubious opinion that pres-
ent conditions in Cuba are not
suitable for the agricultural diver-
sification program requested. In
giving aid to needy members, the
U.N. is avoiding situations of hope-
less poverty which lead to war.

As an example of the U.N. as a
“picker-up of messes,” Deane pointed
to the Congo crisis. He noted that no
one country could have carried out
the operation at less expense to it-
self, and that the use of the U.N.
in the Congo prevented an East-West
confrontation on the issue.

Dr. Jones, John Dunnell Praised
For Performance Of ‘Tartuffe’

By C. C. FLIPPEN -
Executive Editor

“Tartuffe” as performed by the
Troubadours is one of the most
polished and graceful plays ever
produced here.

The Moliere comedy of hypocisy
moves swiftly and smoothly over
showing what fools we humans are.

Directors

Directors Dr. Cecil Jones and sen-
ior Andy Adelson have given the
play a comic finesse which makes
it both a pleasure to the eye and
the comic sense.

The play itself is, of course, about
the raising of Tartuffe from the gut-
ter to a high position in the house-
hold of Monsieur Orgon. Through
his hypocritical piety, Tartuffe is
eventually able to gain such a hold
over Orgon that he is in a position
to destroy him.

Jones in Lead

Jones appears in the title role of
Tartuffe. His professional ability
is apparent from the moment he

takes the stage. In fact during the
Prologue his brief appearance vir-
tually steals that scene. As Tartuffe
he is appropriately lascivious, self-
assured and pseudo-religious. He is
completely convincing in the role.

Dunnell

John Dunnell in the role of Or-
gon gives one of his best perform-
ances here. As the over-zealous,
deluded patron of Tartuffe, he works
himself into a real frenzy when any-
one questions his devotion to Tar-
tuffe. He tops all frenzies, however,
when he discovers that he has been
fooled.

As Elmire, Orgon’s wife, Susan
Dunnell is charming. She moves
with all the grace and beauty one
associates with a lady of that period.
Regrettably her voice proves at times
too weak to cope with a rattling
heater in the rear of the theatre.

Leonard as Cleante

Andy Leonard as Cleante, Elmire’s
brother, gives us a splendid portrait
of “right reason above all.” Over-
flowing with truth and reason from
the moment he takes the stage, he
too proves ineffectual before the
hypocrite.

 

Lisa Tracy

In the role of Dorine the maid, |
Lisa Tracy brings to life one of the |
most spritly, sharp-tongued maids'

who ever befuddled her master. With
a deft touch, she creates some of the
funniest scenes in the play.

Supports

The supporting roles are all well
performed. Carolyn Bing, as Madame
Pernelle, Orgon’s mother, saves the
opening scene of the play from what
could be a slow start with her
crochity performance.

Charlie Bright, as Orgon’s son,
is a very lould-mouthed hot head,
who sounds as though he has spent
much time in Southern France.
George Chapman and Betsy Letcher
are attractive as lovers, though far
from ardent.

Pretty little Kendall Jamison as
another maid, appears but briefly
and has even less to say, but her
face, which would light up any
stage, makes that appearance worth-
while.

It took a cold (and we mean
physically) opening night audience
quite a while to warm up for the
play. And this is our only real com-
plaint. It would seem that some-
thing could be done to heat the
theatre more effiiciently and quietly.

The third performance of the show
will be given at 8:30 tonight. To-
morrow there will be a 3 p.m. mat-
inee and the final performance at
8:30 p.m. Reservations may be made
by calling the Troubadour Theatre.

 

Device Quintet Performs
Tonight In DuPont Hall

The Derian Quintet, scheduled to
perform in an 8 p.m. formal concert
Friday at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, will hold a woodwind instru-
mental workshop at the university
that afternoon.

The workshop will get underway
at 2:30 p.m. in duPont Audi-
torium. The formal concert also
scheduled te be held in duPont and
both events are open to the public.

The quintet made its New York
debut in October, 1961, after being
in residence that summer at Tangle-
wood under the auspices of the
Fromm Foundation. The Dorians
currently are on a tour of selected
colleges and universities under the
sponsorship of Association of Amer-
ican Colleges.

The special workshop will be open
to the public without charge, ac-
cording to Prof. Robert Stewart, as-
sociate professor of fine arts and
faculty adviser for the Washington
Concert Guild. The Con-
cert Guild is sponsoring the local

Kyger Conducts ‘Fruitful’

a - Forum On Frat Problems

By KEN LANE
Assistant Managing Editor

Can fraternities play a role in raising our academic stand-
ards? Should there be a deferred rush? Can the fraternities
be used to increase the loyalty of the student body to the

university?
These were some of the questions brought out in a faculty-

Hotel Robert E. Lee Wednesday

ODK Reviews
Problems Of
Visiting Students

The Alpha Circle of Omicron Delta
Kappa of Washington and Lee met
on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the
foreign student and his place on
the W&L campus. Erik Berg, ex-
change student from Norway and
Raimondo Starssoldo from Italy were
on hand for the discussion.

Both foreign students felt that an
exchange student’s stay on the W&L
campus wouldbe more meaningful
if the students were to stay in a
fraternity house for a longer period
of time, possibly for the entire school
year.

The IFC will bring this matter
up at a later date and attempt to
see what arrangements can be
made.

In conjunction with the current
interest in the role of the foreign
student at the American University,
a report from the Committee on
Foreign Students in the American
colleges and universities felt that
a revision in the program is needed.

Leading educators today endorse
a call for U.S. colleges and uni-
versities to re-examine the philoso-
phy, objectives and operation of their
foreign student programs.

The Committee on the Foreign
Student in American Colleges and
Universities issued a 26-page report
telling the schools that they must,
among other things, spend more
money, cooperate more closely with
governments and agencies which
sponsor such ustdents, and place in-
ternational education “into its prop-
er perspective” as a basic and es-
sential part of their educational mis-
sion.

The recommendations grew out of
several recent studies of the foreign
student situation, such as the Hig-
bee report (“The Status of Foreign
Student Advising in United States
Universities and Colleges,” by Hom-
er D. Hifibee of Michigan State Uni-
versity), which defined the inade-
quacies of foreign student programs
in nearly 2,000 institutions which
now enroll foreign students.

The urgency of need to improve
foreign student programs is under-
lined by the recent increase in the
number of such students, the Com-
mittee stresses.

 

night, under the sponsorship of the
Interfraternity Council.

Ross Kyger, president of the IFC,
stated that the purpose of the con-
ference was to strengthen the liai-
son between the faculty and stu-
dents, and to coordinate an exchage
of ideas about ways of improving the
fraternity system at Washington and
Lee.

In his preliminary remarks at the
conference banquet, Kyger discussed
the critical conditions of the frater-
nity system before an assembly of
sixty-six students and faculty mem-
bers. He emphasized the need for
fraternities to adjust to the new
“era” of rising academic standards.

The conference divided into six
discussion groups, each assigned
with specific topics. The topics in-
cluded such issues as deferred rush,
the assimilation of the non-fraternity
men into the university, and ways
to improve the scholastic standards.

“We were extremely pleased with
the results of the discussions,” Kyger
remarked, “and we feel that we
have arrived at some very concrete
ideas. Suggestions made at the con-
ference will be compiled and studied
by the IFC.”

The discussions centered principal-
ly on scholarship. Proposals were
made to have visiting speakers in the
fraternity houses, to invite faculty
members for discussion sessions, and
to establish in each fraternity a
house “honor roll.”

In addition, the problem of assim-
ilating non-fraternity students into
the university was discussed. In-
cluded in the suggestions to imple-
ment this goal were the possibilities
of a formal second semester rush
for nonfraternity students, and of
inviting more independent students
to meals and parties in the frater-
nity houses.

Among the more controversial is-
sues discussed was that of deferred
rush. “We could make little progress
with this matter,” Kyger commented.
“The idea of second semester rush
was not found entirely unfeasible,
but yet studies of other colleges
produce no concrete support for
changing the present system.”

The pledging program also came
under discussion. A proposal was
made for having an IFC guidebook
for setting up the goals of pledging
and establishing specifie ways to
achieve them. It was further suggest-
ed to abolish all forms of hazing
and place full emphasis on scholar-
ship and extracuricular activities
Also studied was the problem of

Isolation

Immersed as we are in the

academic community of Wash-

ington and Lee, it is easy to forget how peculiarly isolated we
are, and how much this isolation bears on our situation. We are
isolated geographically, surrounded by mountains and located

in a remote section of Virginia.

More important, we are isolated

by the very nature of our institution, compounded by its size

and traditions.

This is as it should be. The chance to be free of worldly
pressures gives the student time to form his character and
ideals. This is in the best tradition of Liberal Education. Here
an individual is free to come in contact with the best of Man’s
aspirations and to learn what he might become.

But with this isolation come responsibilities which we
often—perhaps too often—neglect. That we should be free
from worldly pressures does not mean that we should be ignor-

ant of the world. A moment's

reflection will show how often

we do allow our isolation to become a barrier rather than a pro-

tection.
This need not be the case.

Programs such as International

Relations Week provide us with an opportunity to stay in the
mainstream of world affairs, current thought, and contemporary
approaches. We owe it to ourselves to take advantage of these

opportunities to avoid misusing

 

our isolation.

Waysiders Bring Live Folk Music
To Lexington ‘Just For Fun’

Customers who have walked into
the back room of the College Inn
during recent Friday nights have
found a pleasant addition to their
beer and Mutzies in the form of a
couple of folk singers providing
entertainment. The lights are dim-
med and a spotlight illuminates a
small stage with a black backdrop.
The manager of the duo steps up
to introduce them as “the slowest
rising young folk singers in Amer-
ica,’ and the audience welcomes
them onto the stage enthusiasticaly.

The audience comes to listen, and
it is rewarded with a wide range of
entertainment, from  fast-driving
spirituals to soft blues. As the eve-
ning progresses, only standing room
is left and people sit on the pool
table and the floor.

“Just for Fun”

Known as the Waysiders, Dave
Trussel and Jim Ledbetter began
singing together a few months ago
“just for fun.” That they enjoy sing-
ing is evident to the most casual
spectator, and they try to retain as
much informality on the stage as
they do at their practice sessions.
Hunter Manson, now their busi-
ness manager, approached them with
the possibility of job opportunities
and arranged an audition at the
College Inn and a job at Southern
Seminary. They were so well re-
ceived that they were offered a
regular job at the College Inn on

Friday nights. During the recent
George Washington holiday, they
sang at the Blue Dog Cellar in Bal-
timore, where they have been offered
a summer job.

Song-Writing

Most of the songs that the boys
sing are a result of their own re-
search. “We get more pleasure out
of singing our own songs,” Dave
says, “and there are hundreds of
good folk songs that the current
craze has not brought to light that
we think are worthy of our atten-
tion. However, we are never afraid
to sing some one else’s song if we like
it.” Some of their songs they have
written themselves.

One attractive feature about the
Friday night shows is that there
is no admission. “We want to keep
it this way,” says Jim. “We feel that
Lexington is so devoid of entertain-
ment that something of this type is
needed, and we want everybody to
be able to come and have a good
time.”

Meaning Behind Them

The songs that they sing are in-
teresting in themselves. “The Bells
of Rhymney” and “Springfield Mine
Disaster” are both mining songs
dealing with the tragedy that often
arises from that type of life. “Makes
a Long Time Man Feel Bad” is a
folk blues that comes from prison
inmates, and “Come on Down the
Riggin’” is an original composition
that captures the spirit of the old
sea chanties. They sing many more,
to which they are constantly adding
and changing in order to capture the
feeling of their songs.

“Get the Message”

“What we enjoy about singing at
the College Inn,” says Jim, “is the
feeling we get that the audience has
come to listen to our songs and try
to get the message we want to put
across.” They also enjoy singing hu-
morous numbers that they have ar-
ranged to satirise the current folk
music craze in its various forms.

 

NOTICE

The small display of “Flemish
Images” (art, architecture, and typi-
cal household scenes) will remain on
the bulletin boards adjoining duPont

Taylor announced. The display was

Denton Reports On Mardi Gras:
Makes W&L Weekends Tame?

By NICK DENTON

It was a wild Mardi Gras to be
sure, with hilarity, incongruity
glamour and burlesque riding high
in the saddle.

The only thing to rival the bright-
ness of the sunshine were the glitter-
ing parades and colorful spectators—
over four million of them—who
somehow managed to jam _ them-
selves into some twenty-five square
blocks of New Orleans’ fabulous
French Quarter. From the air it
must have looked like a giant pizza
pie, but down below, the teeming
masses laughed and sang, pushed
and pulled with unbridled revelry
for a continuous one hundred and
twenty hours over every inch of
the streets.

It seemed like everybody in the
world must have met daily at
Canal and Royal Streets for the
parades, turning the showplace
into a mammoth sardine can, But
as packed as it was, an equal
number of people were celebrating
just as hard by jamming St.
Charles, Bourbon, St. Claude, and
Poydras Streets.

What were they celebrating so
frantically? In the words of Rex,
mythical Lord of Misrule, Monarch
of Merriment, and King of Mardi
Gras: “A fig for care!” In other
words, raise hell...and raise it high
and as long as you possibly can. A
wonderful tradition, this, and people
from all over the world have prac-
ticed it each February since 1872.

One particular bar off Bourbon
Street—Pat O'’Brians—seemed to
be the nucleus for all this mad-
ness, and so that is where this re-
porter took a stand. From Friday
through Tuesday nothing better
typifies the festivities than beer,
blood and barf. Everyone had a
can of beer (30c) from one of the
many stands which dotted the
streets, or a “Volcano” glass from
Pat O’Brians, The glasses were
kept as souvenirs or cashed in for
a dollar, but the cans—tens of
thousands of them—were littered
with glee. After a while one could
stand still and almost be rolled
down Bourbon Street! It only
went to prove once again the local
title for Mardi Gras crowds as the
“Beercanderthal Civilization.”

There was at least one parade
every day, topped off on Tuesday
night by those of Rex and Comus. In
all there were some three hundred
floats and an equal number of bands,
and marching or riding units.
Stretching in what seemed a never-
ending line, parades depicted such
themes as “Fantasy of the Sea,”
“Gulliver’s Travels,” “The World of
Mark Twain,” “King Arthur's
Court,” “Egypt,” and almost every
other subject.

Plumed horsemen, motorcycle
police and = sirened trucks  sur-
rounded the parades to keep back
the masses who fought for the
little rubber and plastic favors as

Controversial

Speakers Should
Talk On Campus

By PETE ALFORD
Friday Columnists

“I am here not to agitate. In-
stead I am here to express to you
what I believe in.”

—George Lincoln Rockwell

One subject which seems to occur
quite frequently on the editorial
pages of the Ring-tum Phi when
world shaking events are thin is the
choice of speakers which comes to
the Washington and Lee campus.

At the onset we would like to say
that many fine men from a variety of
fields have been invited to Lexington
and have addressed varying members
of our students and faculty. The
organizations which sponsor these
lectures should be commended and
they should be encouraged to con-
tinue their fine efforts.

Attendance, however, is poor at far
too many of these lectures and sem-
inars; and frequently the guest
speakers, though competent and in-
formative, are not the “headliners”
which, unfortunately, are needed to
attract sufficiently large numbers of
students.

In the last issue of the Ring-tum
Phi (Tuesday variety) a report was
printed concerning the speeches de-
livered at U.Va. by Communist Party
boss Gus Hall and American Natzi
Party Commander George Lincoln
Rockwell and the “mild furor” which
proceeded their appearances.

Your columnist, with a

rather

if they were jewels. I observed
one woman scramble in the gutter
and bounce a small child away
with her sizable hip to retrieve
a string of beads. More color was
added by the lively “flambeaus,”
torch-waving Negroes who danced
about the various parade units
picking up pennies tossed by the
crowd.

A few of the marching units dis-
played precision, but simply rocked,
rolled, rambled—and reeled—along
the routes. What they lacked in co-
ordination they made up with orig-
inality, zest, spirits (very obviously)
and certainly bunions on their feet.
The more lively units were The
Jefferson City Buzzards, the Good
Time Jesters, The Algiers Spartans
Carnival Club, and The Half-Fast

 

Walking Club. Some of these march-
ers never reached the reviewing
stands. Known for their frequent
stops to reinforce and refresh, it is
possible that some of them were
either all tuckered out or were hav-
ing such a good time that they stayed
out of the downtown area. I can’t
help but think that some of them
never planned to pass the stands in
the first place.

Any other time it might be
scandalous the way the people
behaved—and in public at that.
But Mardi Gras week, nobody
blinked a disapproving eye at any-
thing. The New Orleans’ Police
Department did a wonderful job
of “unobtrusive restraint” consid-
ering the immense task of keeping
the parades rolling safely and

 

smoothly, lost children, drunks,
traflic jams, and various disturb-
ances and accidents.

Patrol wagons ran in regular shifts
carting off persons in custody par-
ticularly in the French Quarter, but
there was nothing to compare with
the Friday night brawl in front of—
where else?—Pat O’Brians. One per-
son was stabbed and everyone be-
gan throwing fists, beer cans, and all
else handy until the police charged
the growing mob with horses, dogs,
and hoses.

Throughout the weck only two
pedestrians were hit and there was
only one auto wreck anywhere near
Pat’s. This was mainly because most
of the autos were either carried
through or else covered with rebel-

Crowds throng Canal Street for New Orleans’ annual Mardi Gras to watch a parade and

Analysis Of The Federal Budget
Throws Light On “Tax Cut”

What is the most significant trend in the growing
expenditures of our Federal Government? Are non-
defense expenditures increasing faster than those for
defense production? Is the Government really holding
the line on nondefense spending, or is it proposing
more and more new programs every year?

Answers to these questions—and many others of
interest to taxpayers—are given by the Council of
State Chambers of Commerce in a critical analysis of
the Administration’s budget proposals for 1964. The
study was made in Washington by Eugene F. Rinta,

a noted fiscal analyst.

The “one truly heartening” feature in the
budget—the “recognition by President Kennedy
and his administration that... significant reduc-
tion of individual and corporate (tax) rates
is essential for the attainment of our (economic)
growth potential”—was to be jeopardized by the

size of the budget itself.

The expenditure estimate for 1964 is $988 billion—
which exceeds the highest budget total during World
War II (the $98.3 billion total of fiscal 1945). The
total is $4.5 billion above the current estimates for
1963, and $11.0 billion above the 1962 fiscal year which

ended last June 30.

The Council analysis further notes that the
1964 expenditure total is 29 per cent above that
of 1960, the last full budget year of the previous
administration. That represents an annual in-
crease of $5.6 billion over the four years since

1960.

A cursory comparison of budget 1964 expenditures
by funetional categories with current estimates for
1963 might indicate that the Defense and Space pro-
grams account for the entire increase of $4.5 billion.
But the Rinta analysis discloses that many categories
of nondefense expenditures show a further rise in
spending beyond the sharp increase that have already

been effected since 1960.

1. The $1 billion drop anticipated in farm price
supports is largely accounted for by anticipated sub-
stantial sales in 1964 of cotton expected to be placed
under price support in the current year. Whether these
sales materialize remains to be seen.

2. An indicated reduction of $160 million in Rural
Electrification Administration and Farmers Home Ad-
ministration loan programs is almost wholly accounted
for by a bookkeeping device. A similar proposal was

“rejected by Congress last year.
3. A drop of $248 million in net postal service out-

lays is accounted for by a lower postal deficit due to

the full year effect in 1964 of postal rate increases
approved last year.

4. Foreign economic and technical assistance shows
a reduction of $145 million from 1963, but the fact is
that these activities are being expanded by $278 million,
or more than 10 per cent. The apparent net reduction

is due to an increase in net receipts of $423 billion

by the Export-Import Bank resulting in the main from
anticipated private sales of $540 million of loans it
holds in its portfolio. These sales may prove more
difficult in realization than in budgeting.

5. Expenditures for the conduct of foreign affairs
indicate a reduction of $50 million but this is more

than accounted for by the absence in 1964 of a one-

shot $100 million outlay for U.N. bonds in 1963.

6. A reduction of $250 million is shown for housing
and related programs but $150 million of this results
from an anticipated increase from $49 million to $199
million in private sales of housing mortgages held by

the Federal National Mortgage Association.

In those categories where a decrease was
shown, the analysis explained that some special
factor other than a curtailment of activities is

 

generally involved:

According to Mr. Rinta’s analysis, the fore-
going types of budget reductions would appear
a weak foundation on which to base increases
in other nondefense activities with the claim, as
stated in the President's budget message, that
expenditures for purposes other than defense,
space and interest are being held at the 1963

The analysis further pointed to a substantial in-
crease of Federal civilian personnel. In a period of
three years and five months to the projected end of
the 1964 budget year, the Council study noted that
the Kennedy Administration will have increased Fed-
eral civilian employment by more than 229,000.

What is the possibility of a tax cut in the light

of the spending situation? Analyst Rinta notes

 

 

that the President's tax program places primary
emphasis on rate reductions designed to increase
demand and, thus energize the economy. “In the

issue,” he explains, “the

President and his advisers take the position that
the Government will incur deficits the next few
years with or without tax reduction, but that the
budget will sooner be in balance with rising ex-
penditures if economic growth is encouraged by

rate reductions is so urgent

that rates should be cut promptly,” the Council study
concludes, “but expenditures should be controlled at
current levels. On this basis a balanced budget could
be expected within a year or two. Certainly this po-
sition is an attainable one if the Congress will only
give it a real try.

Wrestlers And Swimmers End Seasons

Georgetown

Falls 58-35

As Tankmen Finish 7-5

By NICK MONSARRAT
Assistant Sports Editor

The varsity swimming team settled
accounts with Georgetown Universi-
ty Thursday with a resounding 58-
35 victory, capturing seven first
places and setting their season rec-
ord at a final 7-5.

Wolfe Wins Twice

Perpetual double winner John
Wolfe once again scored twice in
sweeping the 200-yard and 500-yard
freestyle events. The Generals also
swept first places in the relay, the
50-yard freestyle, 200-yard individ-
ual medley, 200-yard backstroke,
and the 200-yard breaststroke.

 

In a season which saw the W&L
swimmers face four subsidized
teams, Maryland, East Carolina,
West Virginia, and Loyola College,
the victory over West Virginia is
to be especially noted. Excellent
performances by freshman John
Lifter and Bo Bokinsky added to
the final push made by the final
100-yard freestyle relay which
gave the Generals the final victory,
50-45. Maryland, East Carolina,
and Loyola accounted for three of
the five losses during the season.

A 62-32 opening season loss to a
greatly improved University of Vir-
ginia team offered the Generals a
hint of the toughness of the year’s
competition but after a resounding

 

Scoring leader Bo Bokinsky (left) and junior Walt Mc-
Manus on their way to the 200-yard butterfly. Bokinsky swam

the distance in record time this

victory over Roanoke College the
future looked brighter. But two loss-
es in Washington, D.C. the following
week to Lyola and American Uni- |
versity again seemed discouraging.

W&M Forfeits

The week before Christmas vaca-
tion William and Mary forfeited to
the Generals, protesting that W&L’s
use of freshman violated their own
principles of fair play. It is interest-
ing to note, however, that William
and Mary swam other schools this
year, all of which used freshmen.

Consecutive victories over Wake
Forest, Old Dominion, and Lynch-
burg College bolstered W&L's
courage for the pasting that was
expected when Maryland invaded
Lexington. In this meet the Gen-
erals’ times were good but Mary-
land's were far better, with six
pool records falling between the |
two teams.

At season’s end the Generals
managed a win over Georgetown
and a loss to a greatly bolstered
subsidized team from East Carolina.

Record Set |

In the course of the season six
Washington and Lee records were
set by the General swimmers. Fresh-
man John Lifter holds records in
the 200-yard individual medley and
the 200-yard backstroke. Sophomore
John Wolfe set records in the 200-
yard and 500-yard freestyle events.

This week’s sport star honor is
shared by two men who have
worked with dedication for the W&L
wrestling team for the past four
years. They are Jud Babcock and
Dick Albert.

During the past season both have
served as Tri-captains along with
Dave Montgomery, and as Coach
Miller says, “have served well and
have been an inspiration to
team.”

Coach Miller says that Albert and
Babcock have been good team men
and have always been willing to
move up a weight class for the good
of the team, rather than jumping

at the opportunity to wrestle smaller
men.

Jud Babcock has a record of 12-10-1|
for four years of wrestling for the |

Generals. This season his record was
4-5.

Most of Jud’s matches have been
in the heavyweight division, which
is quite a handicap for him in that
he normally weighs 175 pounds. In
most of his matches this season,
Babcock gave up 50 to 75 pounds
to his opponents and still managed
to turn out with a respectable rec-
ord.

Dick Albert has a four-year rec-
ord of 19-11-1. This year he had a
5-5 record, dropping several matches
by one or two points. He led the
squad in escapes with nine, and was

Best Season

By TOM DAY
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee matmen
finished their best season in four-
teen years last Tuesday even though
they lost to a tough University
of Virginia team 18-8. Not since
1949, when Ken Linley, Joe Sconce
and Ken Lindell thrilled the crowd
with their exhibitions has a W&L
team compiled such an impressive
record. Wrestling large schools as
Duke, Old Dominion and North Car-
olina State the W&L grapplers as-
tounded their opponents regularly
and finished the season with an 8-2
record.

The Generals were strong in every
position this year with nine letter-
men from the 1962 squad. With depth
and experience backing them up, the
matmen opened the 1962-63 season
against the Tar Heels of North
Carolina and soundly trounced them
19-8 with Tom Stover pinning his
opponents and West, Montgomery,
Reeves and Winfield gaining deci-
sions.

On December 3 ,the Generals
met a highly respected Old Do-
minion club. Overcoming an 11-0
deficit the big blue matmen went
on to upset their adversaries 17-
11. Four straight decisions by
Stover, Albert and Babcock gave
the Generals a 12-11 lead with
only the heavyweight match left.
Sam Block then wasted no time in
pinning Old Dominion’s Fred Bish-
op and clinching the match for
WEL.

Five days later the Generals
stretched their win streak to 3 by
completely trouncing Pfeiffer Col-
lege 26-6. In this match West,
Montgomery, Smith, and Babcock
pinned their opponents, and Stover
and Winfield gained decisions. Fol-
lowing the match the big blue set
out for the Chattanooga Invitation-
al tournament where the Generals
turned in fine performances.

On Jan. 12, the Generals traveled
to Washington, D.C. to meet Gal-
laudet College. The Washingtonians

Grapplers Wind Up 8-2;

Since 1949

proved no match for the strong
W&L team and went down to de-
feat in a 24-10 slaughter. This time
it was West, Montgomery, and Stov-
er’s turn to put on the show, and
that they did, each pinning his op-
ponent in less than four minutes.
Albert, Winfield, and Smith grabbed
decisions.

Then on February 16 the Gen-
erals win string was snapped by
an exceptionally tough Franklin
and Marshall team 19-12. Losing
three matches by bad breaks, the
Generals couldn't make up the
difference and lost a rough match,
The two bright spots of the eve-
ning came as Pete Winfield and
Jud Babcock pinned their oppon-
ents. With this victory Winfield
stretched his record to 7-0.

After defeating Hampden-Sydney
the wrestling team journeyed to West
Virginia to meet a tough Mountain-
er squad. Still smarting from their
previous defeat, the Generals whip-
ped W. Va. with Stover, Winfield,
and Montgomery gaining pins.

In the last match of the season,
the Generals met Virginia’s other
top team and dropped a tough one
to the Wahoos of U.Va. In _ this
match Pete Winfield lost an extreme-
ly close battle to Virginia’s Alex
Wells, 2-1. This ended his win streak
at seven. Starting out strong
ever, the big blue surged ahead 8-2
at the end of three matches. Then
due to some bad breaks, the Gen-
erals slipped away and_ couldn't
manage to pull it out of the fire.

Next year, Coach Miller faces the
tough job of rebuilding. With sen-
iors Montgomery, Babcock, and Al-
bert leaving there will be some big
holes to fill. Nevertheless, Coach
Miller has great confidence in the
boys that will move up from the
freshman squad and even hopes to
better this year’s 8-2 record.

The football squad and alumni
are anxiously awaiting the whistle
that will resume their annual clash
this Saturday at 2:30 p.m. on Wil-
son field.

yelling students who stole hubcaps,
raised heods, boured beer in win-
odws and built intricate can pyra-
mids on roofs.

The police and fire departments
answered over three hundred calls
a day and were congratulated by
Police Superintendent Joseph I.
Giarrusso “...for their tolerance
and devotion to duty under the most
trying conditions yet experienced.”

Shrove Tuesday was the most
trying day of all. Those people who
did not choose to stay up all night
began their drinking around seven
that morning and worked up a fev-
er pitch at the witching hour of
midnight. Most of the crowds wore
costumes depicting everything
from the Bay of Pigs invasion to
the glories of Ancient Greece. One
ingenious chap sprayed himself
green, rolled in “sparkle powder,”
and paraded about as a crab with
a large net over his head. There
were the usual supply of matadors,
gorillas, robots and men from
Mars, Also tramps, clowns, harem
girls, monsters and dozens of fe-
male impersonators.

A young girl was perfectly out-
fitted as a skunk, complete with high
arching tail and tight furry leotards.
One rather ugly tart of uncertain
age wore the mask of a beautiful
woman, and when the young men
(usually sailors) made overtures she
pulled back the mask to reveal her
rather unprepossessing features and
cackled: “Go home to your momma,
sonny!”

A half-dozen citizens = who
dressed as Alpine mountain climb-
ers got a kick out of climbing
over any car in their path, and
almost made it to a balcony where
the occupants were pelting them
with beer cans. A mounted police-
man cut their rope, however,
with the flourish of a Cossack
warrior.

Ten or twelve men blacked their
entire bodies and dressed in leopard
skins with boned wigs. Their signs
read “The Wa-Goosie Warriors” and
“We Gonna Enlist In Dat Ole’ Miss!”
The spears and shields they carried
protected them from any integra-
tion-mined spectators.

During the evening, one reveler
fell off a balcony and broke his
back. Fights were so common that
they usually ended before the po-
lice could get through the crowds,
and first-aid was rarely administered
if the person was still conscious.
The police wielded their billy clubs
far more sparingly than the bar-
tenders did their blackjacks, and
consequently bar floors all over the
Quarter were awash with beer,
blood and other liquids of various
colors and consistency. People slept
where they passed out or were de-

collected later by the paddy wagon.

Food was almost forgotten since it
took away so much time from the
festivities. You lived on street corner
hot dogs, vitamin pills wheat germ
(if you had a date) and—of course—
alcohol. Even these had to be gulped
on the run since there was no place
nearby to sit unless you just plopped
in the middle of the street as many

did.

All around you maskers of every
design squirmed and swished,
pushed and pulled, trotted and
half-stepped in the fifty degree
weather. Gilded creweuts vied
with nine-foot feather readdresses,
rebel yells with sirenes. Jazz
Combos led dancing marchers
down the side streets and plastic
containers arched ketchup and
mustard into throngs, from sur-
prising distances. Apes climbed
phone poles, walking chandeliers
blinked on and off, and plumed
bird-women screamed as_ waist-
high hands rumpled their feathers.

All in all it was a fantastic time;
one which makes W&L’s parties
very meek in comparison. At mardi
Gras everyone is a stranger, and
there were almost no rules of con-
duct, and certainly no end to the
fun.

only those things which you already
agree with can be of limited educa-
tional value. We must listen to men
with whose philosophy we don’t con-
cur and we must teach their ten-
ets in our schools if we are ever
going to be able to successfully de-
fend against them.

Considering the question under
discussion we do not propose that
Washington and Lee become a hot-
bed of radicalism, but that we
merely be exposed to speakers who
advocate measures other than the
ones we have heard all our lives.
This not only includes the fields of
politics, but also religion, economics,

| TKA Debate Fraternity
Selects New Members

Tau Kappa Alpha, a national de-
bate fraternity, will soon admit five
new members from the Washington
and Lee student body Mr. William
Chaffin, forensic director, disclosed
this week. The five candidates are
Rick Kneipper, Jack Eure, Ed Nor-
ton, Malcolm Morris, and Steve
Smith.

To become eligible for Tau Kappa
Alpha a student must be in his sec-
ond year of active debating and must
be in the upper third of his class
academically.

During the past few weeks Wash-
ton and Lee’s debate teams have
turned in superlative performances
at both the University of South Car-
olina and at Richmond. Two week-
ends ago at the Camellia Tourna-
ment at Columbia, the Washington
and Lee team finished second. Jun-
ior Ed Norton led the team and
was chosen the second best speaker
at the tournament.

Norton’s affirmative colleague was
Ed Fitzgerald. Rick Kneipper and
Jack Eure comprising the negative
team. The Generals have a fine total
of nine wins and five losses.

Last weekend Mr. Chaffin took the
varsity team of Jack Eure and Jay
Clark and the novice team of Mike
Hayslip and Ed Fitzgerald to the
Richmond Invitational Tournament.
The freshmen performed especially
well, winning four of six rounds and
placing third in the novice division.

On February 19 the varsity debate
team staged a mock debate on the
question, “Resolved: the South
Should Have Won the Civil War.”
for a Rotary Club meeting at the
Robert E. Lee Hotel. Al Eckes and
Bill Boardman debated negative and
Jay Clarke and Bill Noell spoke on
the affirmative.

The next two weeks will be just
as active as the past two for Wash-
ington and Lee debaters. Eckes and
Noell left yesterday for a national
tournament to be held at Anapolis.
Reportedly some sixty schools will
be represented at this tournament
