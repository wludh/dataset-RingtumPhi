UPHEAVAL ABOLISHES OLD PARTY TIES

 

Professors
Awarded

Study Funds

A total of $6,020 in university
funds has been granted to 16 Wash-
ington and Lee faculty members for
support of their research and study
projects for 1963.

The awards, supported by the uni-
versity’s John M. Glenn Fund,
were announced Tuesday by Dr.
William W. Pusey, III, Dean of the
College. Individual grants-in-aid this
year range from $150 to $900.

The Glenn grants are a part of
a Washington and Lee program de-
signed to promote continuing facul-
ty scholarship and to increase teach-
ing effectiveness in the classrooms
and laboratories.

Established at Washington and Lee
in 1953, the program is supported
through a $120,000 gift from the late
John M. Glenn, who was an official
of the Russell Sage Foundation and
an 1879 graduate of Washington and
Lee. A $250,000 grant from the Car-
negie Foundation was used to pro-
mote faculty scholarship from 1961
until the start of the Glenn program.

Most of the professors receiving
grants will conduct their research
this summer, but they have until
Dec. 1 to complete their projects.

The 1963 recipients, their academic
departments and projects are:

Dr. W. G. Bean, history, for com-
pletion of a Diary of the Confed-

Faculty Grants
Class-Free Day
Before Exams

Washington and Lee's faculty
moved yesterday to ease the univer-
sity’s exam schedule by establish-
ing a day free of classes prior to
the opening of the next exam period.

The action was taken in faculty
meeting and will initially be in
effect for this semester only, ac-
cording to the announcement made
by Dean of the College William W.
Pusey this morning.

The proposal to lighten class
schedules just before exams was
made by the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
in an editorial November 13, 1962.
The faculty, however, has gone

 

In honor of Washington's Birth-
day no university classes or exer-
cises will be held on Friday, Feb-
ruary 22,

 

 

farther than asked by scheduling no
classes at all on the day before
exams. Prior to this semester class-
es were held without respite up to
and including the day before the
testing periods began.

The Tuesday edition forwarded the
idea of easing into exam _ period
after the University of Virginia made
steps in that direction.

Dean Pusey said this morning,
“The faculty recognizes the burden
which the old exam schedule im-
posed. We feel that Washington and
Lee students have the maturity and
good sense to refrain from abusing
this attempt to alleviate the prob-
lem.”

Under the administration action,
Friday, May 24, will be completely
available to study.

IRW Speaker i Behrman
Cancels Due To Weather

Inclement weather conditions have
forced Dr. Jack Behrman to cancel
his speaking engagement at Wash-
ington and Lee tonight. The Assist-
ant Secretary of Commerce sched-
uled to appear in W&L’s Interna-
tional Relations Week, said that he
will be unable to fulfill the com-
mittment in the coming spring.

Dr. John Gunn, faculty advisor
to the annual conference, made the
announcement just before noon.
Behrman, a former W&L faculty

“Black Jack,” was to speak on “The
Challenge of New Frontiers.” His
topic concerned the Trade Expansion
Act and its implications toward
Western unity.

political party.

 

Change Spurs
Race For Votes

The newly formed political parties
have already started throwing stones,
well over two months in advance of
campus elections.

Shortly after the formation last
Thursday of the new Progressive
Party, the remnant fraternities of
the old Independent and University
parties worked to get the publicity
jump on the opposition by forming
an all new “University Party.”

The result of their move was the
distribution Tuesday afternoon of
a “statement of reorganization,”
printed “in order to offer the Student
Body candidates who will continue
to display high qualities of leader-
ship and responsibility.”

About-Face

Doing what appears to be an
about-face for the old UP, the “re-
organized” party devoted most of its
sheet to cries of vested interests in
the new Progressive coalition.

Prime objects of the charges were
the Publications Board and particu-
larly the Ring-tum Phi.

Implications in the UP circulation
were ‘that their “statement” had
been forced to take the form of a
Protest-like leaflet because of con-
trol of both papers by the new party.

What they failed to mention was
that the party-reorganization init-
iated by the nine fraternities form-
ing the Progressive Party was not
officially completed until after press
time of last Friday’s paper.

Also omitted from the sheet were
the reasons for the reorganization,
which has been in the making by
the nine Progressive houses for some
time: a growing inequality and im-

‘Progressives’ Balance
Campus Party System

By STEVE SMITH

In a surprise move late Thursday night, nine of W&L’s
eighteen fraternities made,a significant step toward balancing
the two party system on campus with the formation of a new

The new combination, to be known as the Progressive

Party, is a coalition of five former University and four Indepen-
*dent Party houses.

Represented at the Thursday
night meeting in the PiKA House
were Delt, Kappa Sig, Phi Gam, Phi
Psi, PiKA, SAE, Sigma Nu, SPE, and
ZBT all of whom pledged their sup-
port to the new party in the upcom-
ing elections.

Tom Woodward, PiKA, was elected
first chairman of the new party.
Woodward said, “A great deal of
basic work was done and various
possibilities considered before the
Progressive Party became a reality.
By equalizing the political structure
at a nine-nine division, we hope to
establish a true two-party system.
Since to end the ‘spoils system’ is
an objective in our formation, the
Progressive Party plans to select its
candidates on the basis of merit.”

‘Seek Out Best Men’

Woodward continued, “Although
the Progressive Party is originally
made up of nine fraternities we hope
to recognize qualified non-fraternity
men in seeking out the best men for
office.”

Reports from the Wrecked Univer-
sity and Independent organizations
indicate that UP chairman Bill
Burke is already working to unite
the remnants of the old blocs. The
nine houses available to him will
merge, probably under the UP ban-
ner since the Independent Party
lost its chairman when Kappa Sigma
Steve Guild joined the Progressives.

Burke also made visits to the
which bolted the UP, in efforts to
the house regain the 10-8 majority
which the Big Clicque enjoyed for
years but his efforts have been un-
successful.

UP Domination

The UP first became a majority
party in 1956 when DU switched its
allegiance. It became a monopolistic
force in 1958 when Sigma Chi also
deserted the Independent Party,
giving the UP 16 of 18 class offices
and six of the Big Seven offices that
year. Last Spring, SPE joined the
UP ranks, leaving the Independent
Party in shambles and giving the
Big Clique a majority of the total
school votes.

If the party line-up remains at
nine University and nine Progressive
houses, the new party will own a
slight numerical advantage of the
fraternity men.

Red Square Split

A significant development in the
emergence of the Progressive Party
is the resulting split of the old Red
Square bloc. For decades the Red
Square houses—PiKA, Sigma Nu,

Dr. Colvin Heads Refugee Group Project

By WARREN FONTGOMERY

Dr. Milton Colvin heads up a
project aimed towards the resettle-
ment of a Cuban refugee family
in Rockbridge County.

Since the middle of January, this
project has been spensored by a
local steering committee under the
leadership of Colvin, W&L Political
Science Associate Professor. The
committee has had the support of
leading citizens of Lexington and
Rockbridge County, including Mayor
Paul A. Holstein and Mrs. Austin
Drumm, and its plans are now near-
ing completition.

The two principal problems facing

the steering committee are employ- |

ment and housing, the former being
the more difficult.
bridge County
it has a high unemployment
rate. Consequently, any Cuban re-
settled in the county must be one

Though Rock- |

who, according to Dr. Colvin, “would
bring a skill badly needed into the
community and who would thus not
take a job away from a Rockbridge
County native.” It is primarily nee-
essary, then, to find a Cuban framily
head has some profesisonal skill in
such fields as architecture, engineer-
ing, laboratory technical work,
counting, or teaching.

An additional requirement for the
family is that it must be one that
would plan to remain a resident of
Rockbridge County until the present
Communist regime in Cuba can be
overthrown,

 

The steering committee is working

in conjunction with the Department
| of Health, Education, and Welfare,
which is in charge of the settlement
of refugees from Cuba in this coun-
| try. The transportation of a refugee
family to Lexington would be paid
by this department.

 

The Cuban Refugee Center in
Miami reports that over 150,000 refu-
gees have fled to Miami from Cuba
since 1959. The majority of these
people were in a destitute condition
on arrival due to the Castro policy
of confiscation of property and be-
longings of emigrants from his
country. But it is also true that many
of the exiles are of the former mid-
dle class and thus are possessed o!
skills and professional knowledge.

This large influx of refugees into
Miami has created an acute housing
and employment problem there, al-
though 45,000 of these displaced Cu-
bans have been resettled in towns
and cities throughout the nation.
Approximately 300 Cubans now live
in Virgiina .

If any reader should know of a
jub opening in Lexington or Rock-

bridge County, he should contact
either Dr. Colvin, Mayor Holstein,
or Mrs. Drumm.

Rumors And The Honor System

Executive Committee members are re-
portedly appalled by the irresponsible rumors
which flourish on campus following honor sys-
tem convictions. The facts of a case are in-
variably distorted beyond recognition, and are
often carried to preposterous extremes. And
yet many students not only believe the rumors,
but they feel no compunction about spreading
them further, adding a little more scandal
with each account. In a recent case, distortions
became so rampant that the EC, for the pro-
tection of the Honor System, was forced to
reveal the facts of the case, an action which
was inconsistent with the EC’s policy of pro-
tecting a convicted student in every possible
way.

No one is more aware of the implications
of an Honor System conviction than an Ex-
ecutive Committeeman. A miscarriage of jus-
tice by the EC could inexcusably wreck a
student’s life and, further, a mistake could
wreck the Honor System, the very system
which the EC has sworn to maintain. It should
be apparent to any level-headed observer that
the EC cannot afford to make such a mistake,

and that, for this reason, a student accused

of an alleged violation is given the benefit
of every possible doubt.

Absurd rumors are not only an insult to
the intelligence of the members of the EC,
but they are also detrimental to the Honor
System itself. They create an image of twelve
ogres conducting an inquisition, and under-
mine the student body’s confidence in the
Executive Committee and in the Honor Sys-
tem itself.

Rumors such as these arise purely and
simply out of ignorance. This situation could
be alleviated if the student body would take
more than an occasional interest in the tech-
nicalities of the Honor System, and if students
who have questions about the Honor System
procedure would take time to talk to EC rep-
resentatives. The Executive Committee would
welcome such interest, for many misconcep-
tions could be resolved, and the EC itself
would profit by the airing of new ideas and
viewpoints.

The members of the Executive Committee
are elected by the student body to uphold
the student body’s Honor System. They de-
serve and have a right to expect the student
body’s interest and trust.

 

The Cut System

The survey of other schools’ absence regu-
lations as they compare with that of W&L’s
(see article, this page) brings out several in-
teresting points.

First of all, we aren’t as bad off as we
thought we were. While our system does com-
pare in degree with the most stringent of those
mentioned, it is not the only one of its kind
in existence. A number of other schools, com-
parable to Washington and Lee in academic
standing, have maintained regulations as
austere as—and in at least one case—more
austere than W&L’s.

Out of necessity, then, we must throw out
the claim that “all good schools have liberal
cut regulations.” They don’t, and it’s as simple
as that. We should be glad, perhaps, that our
system is not more stringent than it is.

Secondly, it appears that at most schools
where liberal or free cut systems have been
instituted, authority to formulate and enforce
regulations has been relegated to individual in-
structors. The presupposition here seems to
be that teachers themselves can most object-
ively evaluate how often class attendance is

necessary for a student’s getting the most
benefit from a particular course.

Whether or not this is true remains to be
seen. As far as we could find out, however,
the “individual instructor” regulations seem to
work very well. In most instances, professors
were quite liberal and lenient in requiring
class attendance.

At Washington and Lee, however, we won-
der whether or not such a system would be
feasible; for, by implication, such a system
places an immense amount of academic re-
sponsibility on classroom teachers. They must
not only be objective and fair in the analysis
of their courses, but they must (ideally) seek
to inculcate real intellectual stimulation in the
classroom situation.

We understand that this idea of individual
teachers’ governing cut regulations has been
proposed, and has been consistently vetoed by
the faculty here—along with every other pro-
posal for a liberalized cut system.

We certainly would not conclude from this
that our instructors do not have confidence

Washington And Lee Skeptics:
In Quest of a ‘University Ideal’?

By BILL LOWRY

Most of the ado about the number
of students, especially freshmen,
planning to transfer out of Washing-
ton and Lee has died down, as hap-
pens every year when the rumors are
caught up with by the actual facts;
one can, of course, look forward to
the spring when, if the past is any
indication, the same questions will
be raised again.

However, the recent discussions
raise some interesting questions
about the nature of Washington and
Lee as an educational institution,
and it is to these questions that I
propose we address ourselves, with
the aim of learning from past mis-
takes and experiences.

Justification for W&L

For many students, Washington
and Lee needs no justification—the
school as it stands is ideal with
any change or proposed change
being an unwanted disruption of the
status quo. Fortunately the number
of such students, although still a
large majority is becoming less each
year. For others however whose
number seems to be_ increasing,
questioning begins with arrival at
Freshman Camp and_ continues
throughout their stay at W&L, how-
ever long that stay may be.
Traditions ‘Glittering Generalities’

Seeing such aspects as con-
ventional dress and the speaking tra-
dition as the glittering generalities
they are, finding little appeal in the
ante-bellum ideal of a gentleman

 

which, as often as not, has less to
do with a man’s character than with
his public image, and even question-
ing that most hallowed of all Sacred
Cows, the Honor System, such stu-
dents have grave doubts about the
real value of a Washington and Lee
education. Answers to the questions
raised by these students generally
have little or no appeal, being based,
as they are, on premises which the
creative or maverick student has al-
ready rejected.

In past years, the response to the
problem of the skeptical student
has taken, roughly, one of two lines:
either the “Washington and Lee is
the way it is—if you don’t like it you
can leave” position; or the “a good
student can get whatever he wants
out of Washington and Lee— all
it takes is a little individual ini-
tiative” approach.

The unusual student, realizing that
he can go to schools where more
emphasis is placed on his own needs,
both as a student and as a person,
and realizing that there are more
important things to spend $10,000 on
than the privilege of wearing a coat
and tie, frequently takes the first
attitude seriously, and transfers else-
where, depriving Washington and
Lee of the insights such students
might provide.

To be sure, there are many ad-
vantages of a Washington and Lee
education, but how many of these,
with the possible exception of the
cult of the “Southern Gentleman”

 

(which has little appeal to the grow-
ing numbers of non-southern stu-
dents), cannot be realized else-
where? Certainly there are several
schools which provide small classes,
opportunities for close student-facul-
ty relations, a sound liberal arts
curriculum, often to a greater de-
gree than Washington and Lee.
Extra-Curriculars

There are, furthermore, many
meaningful forms of extracurricular
activities, but this is not unique with
W&L; and with the exception of
the social activities, often revealed in
their cruder aspects, such extra-
curricular opportunities as discussion
groups and community and _ social
service are given little emphasis.

Furthermore, the lack of a “school
spirit,” embracing and_ reconciling
all of the divergent elements of the
campus community is, with the ex-
ception of the rather notorious ex-
amples of a few alumni, almost
totally lacking, especially when one
compares Washington and Lee with
such schools as Princeton and Yale,
noted for their school spirit; this is
made evident, for example, by pass-
ing out of the Alma Mater on mime-
ographed sheets during University
Assemblies, because no one really
cares about learning the song.

No Symbol for the University

In fact, it is difficult to think of
any symbol which might represent
Washington and Lee to all of its
students; instead of thinking of the

Laudable Or Lamentable?

 

Reviewer Pace Ferrets Out Obscurities
Of ‘Last Year at Marienbad’ Movie

By TOM PACE

One film has recently had a rash
of controversial remarks hurled
upon it. “Last Year at Mariendad”
has been alternately praised as the
finest movie of all time (Penelope
Houston, Sight and Sound) and de-
nounced, by some, as the worst ever
made. Many students of sound mind
and generally respectable opinions
thought it terrible.

Why the Praise?

They deemed it a boring, dull,
psuedo-intellectual film made for
boring, dull, pseudo-intellectuals
who refuse to admit they not only
cannot understand it, but also do not
really enjoy it. If this is true, then
Miss Houston and nearly every other
major film critic would be declaimed
as a fraud. I doubt that they are.
Accordingly, I shall attempt to ex-

 

plain why ‘“Marienbad” has been
praised.
Something New

Alain Resnais is one of the few di-
rectors with a combination of talent
and imagination. What he under-
took in “Marienbad” was to create
that which had not been done be-
fore. He began with a script by Alain
Robbe-Grillet: it was purposeful,
used fine language, and was quite
suitable for Resnais’ plan. Primarily,
it told the story of a man who is
trying to convince a woman that
they had met the year before and
that she had agreed to leave with
him just one year later.

Two Objectives
Resnais, using this screenplay,
wished to do two things. He wanted
to show the thought and reactions
of his characters on the screen.

 

Therefore, while you read or listen
to the narrative, what you see are
the thoughts of the man and the
woman. There is a scene in which
she is killed. She is not actually
shot. Rather, her mind is playing
with the idea of what might happen
if what the may says is true. For
this reason she imagines herself
dying in three different positions.

Certainly this represents her
mind’s reaction to what he is saying.
To confuse matters, Resnais has
mingled the woman’s thoughts with
the man’s, and puts them in what
appears an illogical order. In addi-
tion, he has also mixed actual events
of the last year and the present with
their thoughts. Yet confusion here is
not a fault.

His reason for this is to imply the

As an added note, Amherst has

perhaps we can again take up the
unfinished business of attendance

was the object of considerable
comment, favorable and unfavor-
able, from students and faculty
alike.

Because of the interest this
petition engendered, it was de-
cided to compare our present sys-
tem with those of other schools.

A survey was made of various
institutions and this article is the
end result of that survey.

The schools contacted in the
course of the investigation may
be divided into two groups. The
first group ineludes the smaller
schools with which Washington and
Lee is most often compared. These
are Davidson, the University of
the South at Sewanee, Williams,
and Amherst.

The second group is comprised
of three of the leading larger uni-
versities in the country: Yale,
Princeton, and our neighbor to the
north, the University of Virginia.

In the course of our study the
seven schools were asked to sup-
ply us with their attendance regu-
lations and to comment on the suc-
cess or failure of their respective
systems.

Let’s now take a look at each
of the schools individually.

Davidson
Davidson’s regulations are con-
siderably more liberal than our

credit is limited to 25 per cent of
the scheduled meetings of the
class.” This would be equivalent to
12 cuts per class at W&L.

Davidson’s Dean of Students
wrote, “A growing dissatisfaction
with our prior regulations led to
the rather thorough revision under
which we are operating this year
for the first time. We intend to
evaluate this system and its oper-
ation toward the end of the aca-
demic year. Because of the new-
ness of the system it is impossible
to give a thoroughly sound evalua-
tion of it at this time. It is my off-
hand observation, however, that
the system is working very well.”

Amherst

The Amherst student handbook
reads “At the beginning of the
semester each instructor will state
his policy with regard to absences,
and thereafter, he will report to
the Registrar's office the name of
any student who violates the regu-
lations which the instructor has
set up for his own course. In such
cases the Dean will take appro-
priate action which may include
a reduction in his credit hours or
he may be dropped from the
course.”

First semester freshmen at Am-
herst, however, are allowed no un-

excused absences whatsoever,
either from class or laboratory
periods.

According to an Amherst stu-
dent interviewed by this reporter,
the individual professors’ regu-
lations are “considerably more

regard to absences before and after

vacations. Dean List students only

may be absent at those times.
University of Virginia

From the University of Virginia
Registrar E. W. Lautenschlarger
writes, “There are no hard and
fast absence regulations in the
undergraduate school with students
allowed a specific number of ‘cuts.’
The most basic requirement is that
a student attend at least 50 per
cent of his classes. However, this
is again only a basic requirement.
The matter of class absence is left
to the diseretion of both the in-
structors and the Dean.”

A personal friend of this reporter
said that he was accustomed to 10
or 12 cuts per class per semester
without any disciplinary action
being taken.

It is then easily seen that Vir-
ginia is much more liberal as con-
cerns absence regulations than is
W&L.

Yale's Regulations

Yale’s absence regulations are
also left up to the individual in-
structor. Since we were unable to
obtain first-hand information on
Yale’s system, it can only be as-
sumed that the instructors there
would be lenient in most instances.

In view of the situations at
other schools in which instructors
are responsible, this assumption
cannot be considered too unfound-
ed.

At Yale, however, “in courses
taught as discussion groups, semi-
nars, or in the laboratory, and also

L: How Does It Compare?

foreign language courses, where
the active participation of the stu-
dent is required, the instructor
may require attendance of all stu-
dents.”

Princeton

Princeton's assistant dean of stu-
dents wrote, “Princeton under-
graduates are expected to attend
all of their scheduled University
exercises; however, we do not have
any central recording of class cuts.
In other words, attendance control
is left primarily in the hands of
each instructor.”

Unofficial student reports from
Princeton indicate that the instruc-
tors are “indeed, very liberal” in
their allowance of cuts.

University of the South

The University of the South at
Sewanee allows a student unex-
cused absences in each course
equivalent to the number of se-
mester hours’ credit granted by
that course, plus one. Thus, in a
three-hour course, a student may
take four unexcused absences.

Members of the Order of Gowns-
men (an honor group of students
who have passed regulations set
up by the faculty and who act as
the equivalent of our Student Con-
trol Committee) are exempted from
the above regulations and no rec-
ord is kept of their cuts.

Gownsmen, however, may be re-
quired to attend classes in elemen-
tary language courses and in cer-
tain other departments, “on the
same basis as non-Gownsmen, or
according to a formula which is
less austere.”

Williams

After the first term, Williams

students are allowed a “total num-

ber of absences in accordance with
grades of the previous term using
the following schedule: A or B, five
absences; C, three absences; D, two
absences; E, one absence. If a new
course is substituted for the sec-
ond term of another, the same
procedure holds.” This system ap-
plies to students with below an
over-all B average.

Dean's List students at Williams
follow the same system as those
at W&L. No limit is placed on
their absence taking.

An Analysis of the Survey

The next question to be asked
is what conclusions may be drawn
from the survey.

Generally speaking, Davidson,
Amherst, Princeton, Yale and the
University of Virginia are more
liberal in their absence regulations
than Washington and Lee. Se-
wanee and Williams operate under
systems very closely resembling
our own.

However, and this might be a
blow to those who advocate un-
limited cuts for everyone, even the
five liberal schools will not tolerate
the abuse of absence privileges.

Instructors Determine Rules

Students are expected to abide
by the instructors’ regulations (at
Davidson by school-wide stand-
ards) and every student who vio-
lates those regulations may suffer
the consequences of being dropped
from the course, losing credits, or
being placed on various types of
cut probation.

At Washington and Lee...

What about the
Washington and Lee?

situation at

The problem here is not a unique
one. Davidson went through a per-
iod of criticism and dissatisfaction
much like ours a year ago. The
Davidson faculty decided to see
what would be the result of liber-
alization and the dean there made
the off-hand observation that “the
new system is working very well.”

What would be the result of a
liberalized cut system at Wash-
ington and Lee? Firstly, a new
system would be abused for, as
Kant said, “It is so comfortable
to be immature.” The immaturity
of a W&L student would be mani-
fested in that abuse.

Washington and Lee, however, is
not the same as it was in 1950 or
even in 1962. With each new class
the concern for education grows
stronger. With that concern is a
sense of responsibility almost non-
existent, so I'm told, a very few
years ago.

Unlimiteds ‘Unrealistic’

While unlimited cuts for every-
body is unrealistic, as well as be-
ing impractical, it is time for the
faculty to take a long hard look
at our system.

The regulations which govern
first semester freshmen and_ all
students with below 1.0 averages
are nothing short of ridiculous, in
this reporter's opinion. The regu-
lations for students with a 1.0
are tolerable but in need of re-
vision.

As has been said, if the system
is liberalized, there will at first be
abuse. The only person harmed by
that abuse, however, will be the
immature student involved—and
he can’t be wet-nursed indefinitely.

Duke, Fall To State

Wé&L’s junior varsity wrestling team scored an even split
in two weekend matches with Duke and North Carolina State
of the Atlantic Coast Conference.

The JV’s whipped Duke, 16-14, and* —-——

fell to N. C. State, 21-13.

Jim Burton, Carson Carlisle, and
Tom Ware scored wins in the losing
effort against the Wolfpack.

Burton Pins

Burton pinned Arthur Price in
2:47, after taking a 4-2 lead. Car-
lisle won on a forfeit, and Ware de-
cisioned Phil Howard, 10-1.

The Baby Generals came close to
winning both matches as they drop-
ped a 2-0 and a 3-0 decision to N.
C. State. State’s Tony Warner whip-
ped Bill Wilson, 2-0, on an escape
and riding time; and State’s Wendell
Leonard topped Jamie Andrew, 3-0,
on a reversal and irding time.

A pair of pins by Tom Ware and
Jim Burton paced the Washington
and Lee junior varsity wrestlers to
a 16-14 triumph over Duke’s fresh-
men.

Burton, wrestling at 123, scored a
fall over Duke’s Mike Boehm at
3:45.

Wilson Wins

Bill Wilson boosted the baby Gen-
erals into a 8-0 lead with a 9-4 de-
cision over Sam Walker in the 130-
pound weight class. Trailing, 3-4,
at the end of the first period, Wil-
son scored four points in the sec-
ond stanza on a reverse and a pen-
alty to take the lead for keeps.

Ware, wrestling at 177, sewed up
the match for W&L by pinning Doug
Lyons at 6:48. Ware held a 12-5
point lead at the time.

Near Pins
After taking a 2-0 lead in the first
period, Ware really had a _ battle

 

royal. Twice in the second frame he
scored near pins and once was
nearly pinned himself.

The other JV win was turned in
by Jamie Andrew at 157, Andrew
whipped Jim Moreng, 8-6. Andrew
led all the way, but had to stall. off
a late drive by Moreng.

late W&L rally for the win.
Tigers Take Lead

Although the shooting percent-
ages from the floor, 42.0, were equal,
the Tigers went ahead to stay with
2:09 left in the first half when two
free throws by star Bill Hardin made
the score 44-42 in Hampden-Syd-
ney’s favor.

From there the Tigers built up a
51-45 halftime edge.

Fauber Stars

W&L, paced by superstar Rodger
Fauber and Tom Supak, narrowed
the Tiger margin to 85-82 with 2:00
left in the game.

The Generals, however, missed two
shots that would have cut the mar-
gin to one point. Then they were
forced to foul the Tigers to get the
ball.

Wrestlers Roll By Duke, N. C. State

Washington and Le’s undefeated
wrestling team rolled to its sixth
straight victory Monday night, pol-
ishing off a tough North Carolina
State squad, 19-9.

The victory coupled with a 27-5
pasting of Duke Saturday raised
W&L’s record to 6-0 and 3-0 against
Atlantic Coast Conference oppon-
ents. The only other ACC team on
the Generals’ schedule is Virginia.
The Wahoos, who sport one of the
ACC’s clubs this year, will in-
vade Doremus Gymnasium, Mon-
day, February 25.

F&M Next

The Generals next foe is perennial
power Franklin and Marshall Satur-
day at F&M. Their next home foe is
Hampden-Sydney on February 19.

Tri-captain Dave Montgomery and
undefeated Tom Stover thrilled a
crowd of about 450 fans with pins
against N. C. State.

Montgomery with an 11-1 margin
late in the third period pinned Dave
Jones with only one second to go
in the match.

 

Stover Shines

Stover finished off Fred Cook, who
held a 4-2-1 record going into the
match, in 20 seconds of the second
period. Stover held a 5-0 lead at
that point.

Stover along with Pete Winfield
have 6-0 records.

Butch West at 123 decisioned Rick
Ray, 10-6, in one of his best efforts
of the year.

Freshman Kem White wrestled
State captain Steve Barnes (8-1) a
good match at 137, before bowing,
5-0.

Dick Albert brought his season
record to 4-2 with a 6-1 decision

serves Frank Booth and Allen Black-
burn kept the Tigers’ lead safe.
‘Best Game’

“This was by far our best offen-
sive game,” said coach Bob McHenry.

Fauber paced both the W&L scor-
ing and rebounding with 20 points
and ten rebounds. Supak scored 16
points; Bret Thackston, 14; Louie
Paterno, 13; and Don Wallis, 12.

W&L put four different men, Bill
Smith, Wallis, Fauber, and Paterno,
on H-S’s Hardin during the game,
but the star still managed a whop-
ping 29 points.

Spring Football ‘Practice

Gets Underway Tomorrow
In Usual Bad Weather

Washington and Lee University’s
football squad may be getting the
jump on some colleges by starting
spring practice Wednesday but
Coach Lee McLaughlin doesn’t think
his players will have much of a
head start on the weather.

For three years running now,
W&L’s spring practice has been
plagued by snow and mud and the
weatherman does not give much
hope for a change this year. The
Generals will practice about an
hour and a half daily until March
2 when the annual alumni-varsity
game will be staged.

Coach McLaughlin expects about
60 players—25 to 30 of them fresh-
men—on hand for Wednesday’s ini-
tial session. He will be without the
services of eight seniors plus about
three other members of W&L’s 8-1-0
1962 team, Two fourth stringers ex-
perienced academic difficulties first
semester and a third-string junior
says he won't play next season.

The Generals will only get 13
days of actual practice since George
Washington’s birthday on February
22 is a university holiday and coach-
es plan to call off workouts the 21st,
22nd, and 24th.

Work on Fundamentals
“We'll work on fundamentals dur-
ing most of the practice time,” Mc-
Laughlin observed. “After all, the
most valuable part of any spring
practice is the opportunity to look

 

 

at our new men and see just how
improved our experienced players
are.”

disposing of Duke, running up a
19-0 lead before the Blue Devils
managed to score.

Sophomores Tom Stover and Pete
Winfield, two of the Generals’ un-
defeated wrestling trio, scored quick
pins.

Stover, wrestling at 147, needed
only 4:17 to pin Jeff Lee. The
quick star almost pinned Lee on
his initial takedown, and rolled up
a 8-0 point lead before he put Lee
away for keeps.

Winfield, moved up to 177 in place
of Herb Smith, required only 14
more seconds than Stover to pin
Duke’s Warren Seagraves. His pin
came at 4:31. Winfield had amassed
a 7-0 point lead before he scored the
pin.

At 123, Butch West easily dis-
posed of Randy Meyers, 7-0. West
took a quick 4-0 lead in the first
period on a take down and a near
fall, and coasted from there on.

Tri-Captain Dave Montgomery
topped James Bierfield, 9-5 ,in the
130-pound weight class and Dan
Reeves won on a forfeit at 137.

In one of the night's closest
matches, tri-captain Dick Albert

take down in the first period and

in the second period. Politi’s point

‘Jumbo’: A Bad One

I recently, unwittingly, sat
through nearly twohours of “Jum-
bo.” It is a musical starring Doris
Day, Stephen Boyd, Jimmy Durante,
and Martha Raye. It has a few good
songs, and even fewer good scenes.
I, the viewer, should have known
not to view it. They, the producers,
should have known not to produce
it. The film is featured at the State
Theatre for the remainder of the
week.

Beginning next week at the State
is “Taras Bulba.” It deserves little
comment. It doubtlessly received
more bad reviews than any other
film this past year.

Thursday, Alfred Hitchcock’s
“Rear Window,” with James Stew-
art and Grace Kelley, comes to the
Lyric. Directed by one of Amer-
ica’s best, and filled with fine per-
formances, it is a film good for
two hours of superb entertainment.

“Waltz of the Torreadors” follows.
It starts Sunday. I have not seen
it, but Peter Sellers stars, and it
may be very worthwhile. The play
was a great success, displaying ex-
tremely sharp and cynical comedy.
