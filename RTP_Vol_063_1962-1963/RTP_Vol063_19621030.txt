 

COLD WAR FORECAST: CONTINUED TENSION

By Dr. MILTON COLVIN
Asso. Professor of Political Science

There is something about the con-|
tinuing International Crisis that re-|
minds one of the book entitled
“Growing Up Absurd.”

Mr. Khrushchev says that Russia
will dismantle her rockets and re-

turn them to the Soviet Union;
Castro demands that the United
States give up the Guantanamo
naval base.

Brazil suggests that Africa and
South America be declared “off-

limits” or “out of bounds” to atomic
war and adds that neither conti-
nent should be allowed to make
atomic bombs, and all of this in the
face of common knowledge that no

 

country in Africa or Latin America
has ever made a bomb or is ever
likely to.

At home base in Washington Mr.
Arthur Sylvester, Asst. Sec. of De-
fense for Information, is limiting his
comments to phrases that would
shame a ten year old and possibly
put him back from third to second
grade. And the Democrats and Re-
publicans squabble over who is most
responsible for the victory that has
not exactly been won yet.

Nor is nonsense limited to the
Cuban affair. Across the otherside
of the world China with a popula-
tion it cannot feed of about 700
million is involved in oneupmanship
of casualty claims against India
with a population of 400 million

 

which it cannot feed. Meantime

stock prices are going back up on|

the New York Stock Exchange.
Crisis Over?

But is the fever and the crisis
over? Has Krushchev really re-
formed and are we really back from
the brink and on the highroad to|
peace and disarmament? Not quite
and not yet, I would suggest.

True, a victory of sorts has been
won in that we didn’t go to war.
Indeed, this is the main point. More-
over, we have the Soviet pledge
to get their offensive weapons—
“grim weapons” as Khrushchev calls
them—out of Cuba and thus out of
our backyard.

But we have promised no invasion

 

in return which sounds like a qual-| Berlin where the real showdown was| easily cut and the city itself is 100

ified guarantee of the survival of}
the Castro regime. And the block- |
ade is to go.

So Mr. Castro and his cutthroats
are seemingly to be allowed their
mischief-making forays into the po-|
litical life of our Latin American
friends providing it is done by|
stealth and not by rockets and pro-
viding that no overt action is taken |
by Cubans against Guantanamo.

Mr. Khrushchev has backed down |
but he has done so in the honorable |
name of “world peace” and _ this
will not fall entirely on deaf ears.
The capacity of some “neutrals” to
be deceived is almost unlimited.

Berlin

I think the scene now shifts to

in the first place. In his most recent |
note Premier Khrushchev stresses |

| the need for “regulation of relations

between the NATO nations and the|
nations of the Warsaw Pact.” He|
offers the hope of a detente.

After all, the United States held)
the better hand in Cuba. American
naval strength was overwhelming.
Limited was out of the question. It
is to the Soviet advantage to trans-
fer the up and coming crisis to a
place where the high cards will be
with them. This is Berlin.

Within East Germany the Soviets
have between 24 and 27 Armored
Divisions plus whatever bobtail di-
visions the East German Army can
offer. Access routes into Berlin are

 

miles inside communist controlled
territory.

A show of strength there would be
a Red show of strength and limited
war would be a Soviet victory. What
we shall shortly see, I think, is
strategy superceding tactics and it
is with strategy and NOT tactics that
the final game is won.

Mr. Khrushchev still subseribes to
the idea that “he who controls Ger-
many controls Europe, and he who
controls Europe controls Eurasia,
and he who controls Eurasia gets the
world.” We in America must take
care that we are not outmanuevered
in Germany by concentrating too
much on Castro.

Library
Regulations
Announced

Chairman of the Student Library
Committee Randy Cole made three
policy announcements of major im-
portance this week to users of Mc-
Cormick Library and the Commerce

Library.
His first statement: “Cases in-
volving intentional, wrongful re-

moval of books or any other prop-
erty from the library will be re-
ported to the Executive Committee
for investigation as a possible vio-
lation of the Honor System.”
Second: “Excessive noise, hiding,
or mutilation of books will be dealt
with by the Student Library Com-
mittee and will be subject to fine
upon review.”
Honor System Violation
Finally: Removal of any material
from the Commerce Library will be

considered a breach of the Honor
System.”
Cole said that signs to the ef-

fect of his statements will be placed
in the libraries within week. A
box will be in the library for any
problems to be pointed out to the

a

 

committee and for the report of
violation of regulations.

He emphasized the third statement
because it has not been general |
knowledge in the past. Now, he said, |
the committee is going out of its way |
to ensure that all students realize |
the seriousness of removal of ma- |
terial from the Commerce Library |
and the consequences which will fol-
low.

Enforcement Provided

To enfore the ruling on excessive |
noise, Cole said that members of |
the Library Committee will be in|
the library for observation at var-|
ious times.
The Committee will fine students |
who remove books wrongfully but |
unintentionally, including locked re- |
serve cases, from two to fifty dollars.
Fines in the case of mutilation, |
noise, or hiding will be at the dis-|
cretion of the committee, but will|
depend on individual cases. Recur- |
ring offenders will be dealt with|

severely.

Cole said that his committee is
acting under the authority of the
Executive Committee, which re-|
viewed the announcements before
they were made public.

The Library Committee meets!

weekly on Thursday nights in the
Student Union. In addition to Cole,
the body consists of Jon Supak, sec- |
retary; Steve Parel, Al Eckes, John |
Graham, Walter Bennett, and Steve |
Smith.

NEWS BRIEFS

Hollins’ Herd
Best All-Round

The Hollins College dairy herd
of 49 cows has topped all other
Roanoke County herds in Dairy Herd
Improvement Association competi-
tion for a given month, according
to figures published in the Roanoke
Times.

The herd average was 43.4 pounds
of fat, show the statistics, which
were compiled by Eddie Allen, coun-

ing 17 herds were tested by DHIA
supervisor Warren Rhodes.

The Hollins herd also has re-
ceived praise for its high record of
milk output per individual cow,
having achieved one of the highest
percentages of production per cow
in its area. Figures on the herd’s
degree of contentedness were mo-
mentarily unavailable.

Published reports on bovine prog-

Tim Morton, Gay Reading Hold
» "* Lead Parts In ‘Inherit The Wind’

By LARRY MEEKS

The first of two dress rehearsals
of the Troubadour play, Inherit the |

Wind, was held last night at the|
Troubadour Theater. The drama,
based on the famous Scopes’ mon- |

key trial of Hillsboro, Tennessee, |
was written by Jerome Lawrence |
and Robert E. Lee, and is being}
directed by Dr. Cecil Jones, assist- |
ant professor of Fine Arts and fac-|
ulty director of the Troubadours.

The leading roles in the play are}
being played by Gay Reading and}
Tim Morton. Gay Reading plays the}
part of Brady, whose historical |
counterpart is William Jennings|
Bryan. Reading is a sophomore, and |
this is his second appearance with
the Troubs. His first was the part of
Gratian in Shakespeare's Othello. In |
the play Brady is the lawyer for
the prosecution in Hillsboro, and he |
is determined to uphold the teach- |
ings of the Bible against the Theory |
of Evolution.

Drummond, the lawyer for the
defense, is played by Tim Morton
and finds his historical counterpart |
in Clarence Darrow. Darrow is up-|
holding the right of teacher to
teach evolution but is not necessarily
defending the theory.

15 Pledges Save House From Collapse

whom are Jewish.

At the end of Rush Week the PEP’s listed only two pledges

VMI Plans
Dress Parade
For WGL

The Virginia Military Institute
Cadet Corps will honor the Wash-
ington and Lee student body with
a full dresss military parade this
Thursday. Si Bunting, captain of
the cadet corps at VMI, stated that
a review of troops would be held
in honor of W&L.

The entire W&L student body is
invited to attend the cadet review-
ing of the troops. The review is
being held on Thursday, November
1, at 4:15 at the VMI parade grounds.

As an effort to show W&L men a
phase of the military student’s life,
this invitation is being made _ to

strengthen the relationship between ,
VMI and W&L. This idea of staging |
a military parade originated with

Regimental First Captain Si Bunting,
cadet corps commander.

The VMI corps is to be reviewed
by the VMI heads of staff, with the
top W&L ROTC cadet officers. Sam
Bloch, Battalion Commander, heads
the representative group from the
university.

Bunting stated that he felt that,
“something is needed to improve the
relationship between the two schools.

and have now picked up six sopho-
mores, nine freshmen, and four so-
cial members.

For years a “Gentlemen's Agree-
ment” had permitted the two Jewish
houses the assurance that no Jewish
freshmen would be pledged by the
other 16 houses. In return neither
the PEP’s nor the ZBT’s rushed
gentile freshmen.

Now an open rush seems to be in
the offing next year. Actually the
seeming “closed rush” system had
not been complete—two years ago
the president of the PEP house was
a gentile. However, the fraternity
had not technically rushed him; he
depledged from another house, be-
came a social member of the PEP
house, and subsequently an active.

Randy Cole, ZBT president, said
that his fraternity will join in an
open rush next year. He expressed
reservations, however, as to the
number of men the ZBT’s would
rush; used to a virtual monopoly
on a good group of freshmen, the
house may take its time about
entering into full competition with
other houses.

During this year’s Rush, the
ZBT’s sent observers to the other
fraternities to become familiar with
more competitive rushing. This move
apparently was made under the as-
sumption that the PEP’s would leave
campus and that the ZBT’s would
be forced into open rush in fairness
to Jewish freshmen. Now open rush
has developed in a very different
framework.

The pledges of the rejuvenated
PEP house are Bill Surbaugh, Brax-
ton Tabb, Eric Hanson, Kline Bolton,
Bob Brooks, Bill Supon, Jim Boch,
John Anderson, Ken Bernhardt, Tim
Carpenter, Herb Mitchell, Bill Can-
non, Bob Hudson, George Meier,
and Fred Taussig.

VMI Dress Review

As far as we can tell, relations between W&L students and
VMI cadets have never been particularly good. Perhaps the
only area where the two student bodies ever found a common
denominator was in athletics, and the rivalry that existed there
was wiped out with the advent of Purity at Washington and
Lee. Since that time, the relationship between students of each
school has simply been one of tolerance.

For this reason, we are pleased to learn that VMI’s student
government is sponsoring a full dress inspection and review
in honor of Washington and Lee. The purpose of the ceremony
is to promote improved relations by demonstrating the spirit of
VMI. We think the idea is excellent, and that VMI’s initiative
is commendable.

The ceremony itself will be impressive, but even more im-
pressive is the fact that it will be in honor of Washington and
Lee. We hope the student body will show its appreciation by
attending.

Dissnia’ : Wein

The Eighth Annual Parents’ Weekend is over, and from
all indications must be adjudged a success. More than the
anticipated 1,000 parents attended, and most of them seemed
duly impressed with their sons’ collegiate environment.

The Office of University relations and Dr. John Wise,
chairman of the Parents Weekend Committee, are to be con-
gratulated on a well organized and executed program.

Perhaps the only factor detracting from the success of
the weekend was the inadequate amount of quartering space in
Lexington for the parents.

This was due to the conflicting dance weekend and Home-
coming at VMI which naturally drew a large number of par-
ents and alumni to town.

Perhaps in the future an effort will be made to plan major
weekends of the two schools on separate dates, so as to avoid
overcrowded motels and restaurants.

Executive Committee Functions
As Co-ordinator Of Student Life

By TRACY HARRINGTON

In a generation of radicalism and
change for change’s sake, the W&L |
campus has much the same atmos- |
phere that prevailed here 30 or 40
years ago.

The traditions of conventional
dress, and speaking, the Honor Sys-
tem, and the freedom of student
self-government have endured.

Largely responsible for keeping
Washington and Lee’s singularly
unique atmosphere from deteriorat-
ing is the Executive Committee
the nucleus of student life at W&L.

Everybody knows that the EC en-
forces and governs applications of
the Honor System. But what about
its other functions?

| of concern, the EC holds the purse

strings to the student activities fee

and the student body fund, which

amounts to approximately $20,000.
The Four Committees

Although the four committees—
Assimilation, Cold Check, Student
Library, and Student Control—func-
tion as separate organs of student
government, they are all ultimately
under the supervision of the EC.

In addition, the EC chooses all
the members of the four committees,
and can—should they deem it neces-
sary by a two-thirds vote—reverse
any decision of the Publications
Board and Dance Board.

Student membership of the Uni-
versity Committee on Intercollegiate
Athletics is selected by the EC, as
Washington and Lee’s_ repre-
sentatives to Who’s Who in Ameri-
can Colleges and Universities.

The EC’s primary function, of
course, is to enforce the Honor
System. It decides on just what areas
are covered by the system, as well
as what are to be considered “fringe

Reds Analyzed
By FBI Official
In New Book

By JOHN KIRKLEY

What is the appeal of Communism?
This is an important question dis- |
cussed in J. Edgar Hoover’s new}
book, A Study of Communism.

We in America are at least par-}|
tially aware of the gross dichotomy |
of Soviet ends and means. We see |
“brutality, thought control, oppres-
sion, and human degradation where |
communism promised _ liberation,
justice” and an ideal society. We|
see communists promising peace and
acting to incite aggression.

We also know of the failure of
Soviet economic hopes: Russia and
China are simply not producing
enough food and material goods to
adequately meet the needs of their
people. For these reasons it is dif- |
ficult to see why

individuals can |
become seriously interested in com- |
munism.

But we are sheltered in many}
ways from the appeal of commun-|
ism. Communism is not socially ac-
ceptible in America. Our education
enables us to see the great disparity
between Soviet means and ends. Our
material wealth makes us less sus-
ceptable to the economic offers of
commusism. Our comfort renders us
numb to offers of a better way of
life.

But to the ignorant, the hungry,
the oppressed communism comes as
a seducer of the mind. Commun-
ism is a beast clothed in glowing
garments and with a smiling face.
It offers food, clothing, shelter, se-
curity, happiness, relief from pain.

Hoover mentions four major at-
tractions of communism. The first
economic. Communism offers poor
people material goods through the
communal efforts of the (future)
world state. Sociological advantages
appear to all those who are in any
way disturbed at existing social in-
equalities or frustrated in attempts
to bring about social reform through
legitimate means.

Communism attracts new nations
through providing hope of political
advantage. As evidence for their
case, they point to the Soviet Union
as a going concern and attribute all
its advances and its present status
in the world to communism. To
idealists seeking a quick remedy to
political ills, communism seems to
provide a means to utopia.

The fourth attraction, which is
very strong and appeals chiefly to
individuals, is the psychological at-
traction. To the insecure it offers a
tangible goal, a certainty: “Com-
munism will triumph.” For the weak,
unable to bear responsibility ,it of-
fers a retreat: one can lose himself
in the party, achieve a sense of per-
sonal accomplishment in the suc-
cess of the group. For those with a
“will power” it offers a means of |
controlling others. For the undi-
rected it provides a cause to which |
they can dedicate their lives; in |
serving communism, they think they |
serve humanity and contribute to
the inevitable course of history. |
Every man becomes a hero; each is
necessary to the forward march of
the faith. This undoubtedly is a
strong appeal and one which is hard
to combat.

Washington and Lee’s Glee Club harmonizes during its initial performance of the school
year last Saturday as a Parents’ Weekend feature.

Washington & Lee’s Glee Club
Works Hard To Attain Success

By JIM De YOUNG

Last Saturday night marked the
first public appearance this year
of Washington and Lee’s Glee Club
and the John A. Graham Brass
Choir.

Most people thought it was an out-
standing concert. Sam  Channell,
president of the Glee Club, said
Saturday night’s performance was
the best in years. “The sound was
excellent, the tone and quality was
good, and all the voices blended
well together.”

Channell did say that the club
had difficulty in the use of their mu-
sic, and that the music sheets were
an obvious hindrance in the club’s
rendition of With a Voice of Sing-
ing, where the club had trouble with
the different entrances in the song.
He also said, though, that the mem-
bers would no longer use their
music in performances, which he
thinks will lead to greater expression
to the club.

Versatility

This year the chief characteristic
of the club, once again appears to
be versatility. The 60-man group has

 

twenty new freshmen who have all

had experience and who are showing
great potential so far this year, ac-
cording to Glee Club Director Robert
Stewart .

He added that these freshmen,
combined with several of the four-
year men and soloists in the club,
including Dave Spencer, manager of
the group, John Baker, Phil Booth,
Sam Channell, Jim Mell, and Bob
Aylin have done an outstanding job
for the Glee Club this year as have
the other members who have sacri-
ficed their time to make W&L’s
glee club even a better organization
than in past years.

Recording Released

Earlier this year the club re-
leased their first recording. The
record includes such songs as Broth-
ers Sing Out, two choruses from The
Messiah and several old college
favorites. This record may be pur-
chased in the University Co-op.

What does the Glee Club have
planned for this year?

As usual, the club will perform
concerts through the Central and
Eastern part of the United States.

Once again the highlight of the

 

season will be a spring concert tour

which will include performances in
Atlanta, Georgia, and Wilmington,
Delaware.

On November 8th, the club is
scheduled to sing in Clifton Forge
and perform with the Brass Choir
as a part of the Community Con-
cert Series there.

To Sing With Baldwin

More than a week later the club
will combine with the Mary Baldwin
choir in presenting a Sunday after-
noon concert in Staunton.

Two of the selections that will be
sung are Te Deum Laudamus com-
posed by J. Haydn and Fantasia on
the ‘Old 104th’ Psalm Tune composed
by R. Vaughan Williams for piano
solo, orchestra, organ, and chorus.

In the joint concert, Dr. James
Leyburn will play the piano and a
thirty piece orchestra will perform.

There will also be the traditional
candlelight service in the R. E. Lee
Memorial Church before Christmas
vacation.

Washington and Lee’s Glee Club
has worked hard in the past to pro-
vide good entertainment, and this
year’s organization promises to do
even more as an accomplished group
of performers.

 

Debate Team
As Highlight

By SHANNON JUNG |
The affirmative would easily win}

|a debate whose proposition reads: |
| Resolved, That the exhibition debate

staged last Friday was the Parents’
Weekend highlight. The evidence is
conclusive; the parents enjoyed tre-
mendously the debate presented by
two teams of W&L’s champion de-
baters Friday night.

Resolving that the South should
have won the Civil War, a pair of
Southerners, Jay Clark and Bill
Noell, patriotically argued the af-
firmative. Supporting the negative
stand, Bill Boardman and Al Eckes,
both Yankees, took the opposing |
view.

After an introduction by Debate

“Uncle Remus” tale. This tale, in
fact, would make both resulting

 

Coach W. W. Chaffin, first affirmative |
Bill Noell thanked Chaffin for his |
“complimentary, but slightly doubt- |
ful,” remarks.

Re-Creates The Civil War
Of Parents’ Weekend Meet

Showing that this military victory |
would have forced the South to in-|
dustrialize, he proposed the eventual
union of the two sections into a
stronger nation than actually did)
result.

After cross-examination on_ his
affirmative stand, first negative
speaker Al Eckes reasoned that Mr.

countries vunerable to communist
domination, he stated.

Eckes proposed a myth of his own.
Using E. D. Adams as an authority,
he hypothesized that if the South
had won the war, Britain, which
needed the cotton, would have con-
quered both the North and _the|
South separately.

Foreign Aid for South
Cross-questioned as to why the |

 

Jay Clark, second affirmative, up-
held the contention that Southern
wealth had nosedived because of
Northern reconstruction. As well as
economic advantages, he said, many
cultural advantages would have re-
sulted if the South had won the
war.

As examples, Clark noted South-
ern Parties—famous for their su-
periority, and well known writers—
Stowe, Poe. Eckes hastened to make
mention of Tennessee Williams.
Substituting Uncle Remus for Uncle
Sam as a political figurehead, Clark
pointed out other Southern cultural
advantages, such as the engender-
ment of noble characters as person-
ified by himself and Noell.

tactical gain in Cuba and a possible

that the world will get another

High Band

Delights 4,500 Grid Crowd

By JOHN ALLGOOD

A delightful mixture of an inter-
national tour and a return to the
swing era of the 1930’s entertained
4,500 Washington and Lee parents
and students Saturday at the W&L-
Franklin and Marshall football game.

This musical journey was pre-
sented by the Cave Springs High
School band under the direction of
Paul B. Noble, Jr.

The band, which finished second

in the international competition

 

The treat, however,
come.

After a salute to the Moms and
Dads with an alternating M-O-M
and D-A-D formation to the tune
of “Oh, My Pa Pa,” the band
brought a touch of nostalgia to the
elder members of the crowd.

With drummer Johnny Ashford
in the spotlight the band reminisced
of the Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa
era with “Cherokee.”

Among its recent awards the band,

in rolling up a 21-0 halftime lead.

Hoover On Communism
(Continued from page 2)

It is a dissilusionment that causes
many to forsake communism, says
Hoover. Many eventually realize
that communist methods rarely coin-
cide with communists goals. In other
sections of the book, Hoover dis-
cusses the origins and historical de-
velopments of communism, the con-
tributions to its ideology by various
men, its present power structure, its
imperialistic policies, and its chal-
lenge to freedom.
