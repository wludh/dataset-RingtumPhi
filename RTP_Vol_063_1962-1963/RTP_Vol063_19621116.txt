Reasons for the Theme

Dance Board President Frank
Young explained that the “Civil
War” was selected as the theme
of Faney Dress for a number of

reasons.

First, Young explained, the theme
is of current historical significance
and Lexington, “the shrine of the
South,” is an ideal setting for such
a motif

Secondly, the suitable geographic
distribution students from both
sides of the Mason-Dixon line would
stimulate interest.

Finally, Young commented,

formal evening dresses without hav-
ing to rent special attire

The costumes will consist of both
military and civilian outfits of the
Civil War area. The military cos-
tumes include those of all ranks

presidents, the presidents of the 18
fraternities, and a representative of

“The figure,’ Young stated, “will

bers of the diplomatic corps.

Also to receive special costumes
will be the members of the Dance
Board, the Dance Board Advisory
Council, and the EC, all of whom
will be attired as junior officers.

A variety of costumes will also
be available to the students at
large, including contemporary civil-
ian suits as well as uniforms of the
Southern and Nothern armies.

Young reminds students that the

 

uniforms are provided on a limited
basis and will be rented on a “first- |
come, first-serve” policy.

The printed formal invitations to

Young remarked that “the Dance
Board hopes that the theme will
help patriotic sentiment among the
respective Northern and Southern

tional growing of beards and mus-

Features Three Noted Poets

Eberhart, Lowell
Nemerov To Lecture

Three of America’s most distinguished poets—Richard
Eberhart, Robert Lowell and Howard Nemerov—will partici-
pate in a series of readings and lectures at Washington and
Lee University in late November and early December.

Their appearance will be spon-*

sored by the Glasgow Endowment
Committee, which since the _ insti-
tution of the Glasgow endowment
in 1956 has brought to the Wash-
ington and Lee campus such literary
figures as Katherine Anne Porter,
vohn Ciardi, William Humphrey,
Merle Miller and Edward Albee.

Eberhart, Lowell and Nemerov
will appear in a program opening
Monday, November 26, and lasting
through Tuesday, December 4.
Though each will give his readings
and lectures in turn, the series is
planned so their arrivals in Lex-
ington will overlap and thus pro-
vide continuity for the program as
a whole, according to Dr. A. R.
Borden, professor of English and
chairman of the Glasgow Endow-
ment Committee at the university,

In addition to their formal ad-
dress, the three poets will conduct

classroom meetings and _ seminars
and take part in informal coffee
hours to which students, faculty

and interested townspeople are in-
vited. All program sessions are open
to the public without charge.

The series will open at 8:15 p.m.
Monday, November 26, at the uni-
versity’s Troubadour Theater,
Eberhart will present a_ public
reading from his poems. Tuesday
afternoon—at 4 p.m. in duPont
Auditorium—Eberhart will _ be-
present for an informal reading
from one of his shorter verse plays,
“Preamble II,” and afterward will
discuss the play itself and some
of the problems and_ possibilities
of dramatic verse. He will make a
final appearance at 8:15 p.m,
Tuesday when he lectures on
“Emerson and Wallace Stevens” at
the Troubadour Theater.

Wednesday afternoon, Eberhart
and Lowell, who is expected to
arrive that day, will be guests at
an informal coffee hour in the East
Lounge of Evans Dining Hall. The

 

time is 4 p.m.

Wednesday night, Professor Nor-
throp Frye, a noted contemporary
critic and principal of Victoria Col-
lege, The University of Toronto, will
speak on “The Function of Imagery
in Modern Poetry” in duPont Audi-
torium. Fry’s appearance is spon-
sored by the Seminars in Literature,
a separate Washington and Lee or-
ganization, but the coincidence was
noted by Dr. Borden as one adding
interest to the Glasgow plan. Frye’s
lecture is scheduled for 8:15 p.m.

Lowell will speak Thursday and
Friday nights at the Troubadour
Theater. His first appearance will
be a reading from his own work.
Friday night, he will read from
the poetry of others and comment
on it and on certain more general
aspects of literature. Both read-
ings will be held at 8:15 p.m.

Nemerov will arrive in Lexington
Monday, December 3, and will read |
from his poetry at 8:15 p.m. Monday

| in the Troubadour Theater. Tuesday

afternoon, he will be guest at a
second coffee hour in Evans Dining
Hall. His final appearance will be
a lecture at 8:15 p.m. Tuesday in
the Troubadour Theater. His lecture
is entitled “Bottom’s Dream.”

All three of the poets appearing
on the Glasgow program this fall
are widely known.

Eberhart, a native of Minnesota, a
graduate of Dartmouth and now a
member of its faculty, has been
publishing poetry since 1930. His
books include “A Bravery of Earth,”
“Reading the Spirit,’ “Selected
Poems,” “Undercliff,’ “Poems 1946-
1953,” “Great Praises’ and—most
recently— “Collected Poems 1930-
1960” and “Collected Verse Plays.”
Eberhart was Consultant in Poetry
at the Library of Congress from
1949 to 1951 and is a member of
the National Institute of Arts and
Letters.

Lowell, member of a_ family
prominent in American letters for
a century, is a native of Boston
and a graduate of Kenyon College.
His volumes include “Land of
Unlikeness,” “Lord Weary’s Cas-
tle,’ “The Mills of the Kava-
naughs,” “Life Studies” and “Im-
itations.” He has won both the
Pulitizer Prize and the National
Book Award, has held numerous
fellowships, and is a member of
the Academy of Arts and Letters.

Nemerov is the youngest of the
group. He was born in New York
City in 1920 and is a graduate of
Harvard University. As a teacher, he
has served on the faculties of Ham-
ilton College and the University of
Minnesota, and this yesar he is a
poet in residence at Hollins College.
He has written both verse and fict-
ion. His poetry includes “Image and
the Law,” “Guide to the Ruins,”
“The Salt Garden,’ “Mirrors and
Windows” and “New and Selected
Poems.” His published fiction in-
cludes “The Melodramatists,” “Fe-
derigo or the Power of Live,” “The
Homecoming Game” and “A Com-
modity of Dreams.” He also has con-
tributed critical articles to various
periodicals and received numerous
prizes and fellowships.

Exam Schedule

We are pleased to note the support and approval that has
been given to the recent proposal concerning the schedule
changes before examinations. As the Tuesday Edition pointed
out, a serious problem does exist. A bad examination schedule
could have a disastrous effects on even the best student.

As was pointed out, we are in an age that stresses academic
excellence. There is constant pressure on the student to achieve
higher and higher marks. It therefore seems only logical that
very reasonable means should be explored to achieve this
end. In addition, examinations are a strain and a burden on
both the faculty and the students. As examinations are a
necessary part of our system, we should seek to follow a course
that will lead to the best results from both sides.

The proposed program would allow a breather before the
examination period begins. It would afford the student a
chance to organize before facing two weeks of examinations.

Of course, it is difficult to offer any change that will be
fully acceptable to everyone. There are always objections that
can be raised from both sides. However, this plan was designed
to create a minimum of problems and raise a minimum of ob-
jections. One of the strongest objections would be against the
provision that would have no new work assigned in the last two
periods before examinations begin. However, this problem is
not so great as it would appear. Careful planning and scheduel-
ing could eliminate this objection.

In addition, this system could be incorporated within the
existing school calendar. No changes would be necessary. This
could avoid many problems that other such changes could
create.

In order for such a proposal to become a reality, it would
be necessary for everyone concerned to enter the discussion
with an open mind. It can be argued that the present system
has existed for many years. However, this does not necessarily
mean that it is the best system. We feel that this proposal offers
the easiest possible solution to the problem.

Although it may require a semester for such a program to
be initiated, ample time would be available for all problems
to be solved. This is an excellent proposal and bears the con-
sideration and support of everyone concerned.

 

Fancy Dress Costumes

Costumes for the 1963 Fancy Dress Ball will go on sale
shortly after Thanksgiving vacation. The costumes this year
are based on the uniforms of the Civil War period.

In choosing the ‘Civil War’ as the theme for the Ball,
the Dance Board made a wise decision. As the Civil War cen-
tennial reaches a mid-point, it is only appropriate that we at
Washington and Lee recognize in this way the role this institu-
tion played in the war years.

Another benefit will accrue to W&L men as a result of
this selection. This year they will only have to purchase their
costume. The Dance Board has said that formal evening gowns
will be the appropriate attire for dates.

We encourage the support of the student body in purchas-
ing costumes and taking part in the Ball in general. It should
be the fanciest of Fancy Dresses in many years.

 

Flatt And Scruggs
To Visit Lexington

By JIM LEDBETTER

The past week has been a stimu-
lating one in the Washington and!
Lee curtural community. Lectures
in the fields of journalism, religion,
and psychology have been offered
by distinguished visiting authorities
in these fields, affording students
a chance to supplement their courses
by listening to provacative thinkers
air their views.

There is more to culture than
stolid lectures, however; and it is
in this spirit that a forward-think-
ing local men’s club offers tonight
a seminar designed to round out, and
to counterbalance, this week of edu-
cational activity. We are referring,
of course, to the appearance of Les-
ter Flatt and Earl Scruggs’ Grand

Student Attacks Humor Magazine
For Lack Of Originality

To the Editor
Ring-tum Phi:

In the light of the most recent
issue of the Southern Collegian,
Washington and Lee’s so-called hu-
mor magazine, I believe several
points should be brought forward
concerning publication of college
magazines in general and humor
magazines in particular.

I believe the characteristics of a
well-written and ably published
magazine on the college level are as

 

 

 

| very well be true. If so, why must
| we put up with the crude, imma-
ture humor presented to us in the
Collegian? People of our age and
education, incomplete though it may
be, are taught to set our cultural
standards a bit higher than humor
based on cruidities and absurdities.
The Collegian seems to lack matur-
turity. Of course, with maturity we
obtain the “right” to become openly
risque, as opposed to behind-the-
barn dirty stories, etc. However,
there is a limit. It seems that the

ved in presenting obsceneties.

Good, sophisticated humor can
find its basis in satire and wit.
Satire allows for a tasteful amount
of both absurd situations and baw-
diness. Satire has been lacking in
the Collegian for a very long time.

3) Universality—The content of a
good college magazine should not
be restricted to the campus on which
it is written and published. Jokes
are usually universal; but the Col-
legian content is usually based on
subjects known only to Washington
and Lee students. We may think a
story is humorous, but an outsider

plans for construction of the head-
quarters.

But our educational institutions
were by no means taken by surprise.
They anticipated, planned, and then
built on a gigantic scale. Large
campuses sprawled even larger while
smaller colleges sought frantically
to avoid bursting at the seams.
This growth process still continues
without abatement.

Thus the physical space was se-
cured for most of those who sought
it. If their qualifications stood up

Freshmen Well-Prepared

The jump from high school to
college, reputedly one of the great-
est changes one makes in life, has
become something less than deserv-
ing of this reputation. Indeed, the
gap between these two phases of
education has shortened to a mere
step, for the most part naturally and
easily made.

However, it is a sad commentary
on American colleges and universi-
ties that in many cases this still
important step is a step downward.
The freshmen we see now are the
best prepared group ever to enter
our colleges, for they have come
from secondary schools which have
long been the center of public at-
tention. In the heat and glare of
an understandably critical public
sportlight, these preparatory insti-
tutions have made changes. The
bitter attack upon the secondary
schools has made it necessary for
them to improve in content, quality,
and effectiveness.

ondary schools and the colleges have
responded to this challenge with
various programs.

Apparently the secondary schools
have accomplished their goal with
reasonable success— the number of
students gaining admission to col-
lege rises every year. Further, the
number of scholarships and_ stu-
dent loans to the top students has

risen astronomically. This should
be indicative of better prepara-
tion of a larger number of stu-
dents.

But have the colleges kept pace.

with the advances in other areas
of education? That is the issue in
question here.
Placement Tests
One of the steps cited as academ-
ic improvement here is the place-

ment tests for freshmen. These tests, |

given in September of the freshman

 

year, are designed to pick out the

 

 

 

,eream of the new class and chan-
nel it into courses at an advanced
level. This program seems to admit
that freshmen are progressively be-
coming more and more capable of
handling work at levels higher than
that into which they are normally
matriculated. This number of ad-
vanced freshmen consistently rises.

The reflective thinker will at once
ask, “Does this not mean that, as
the freshmen surpass the offered
content of the first-year college
course, this course becomes anti-
quated and should either be criti-
cally revised or dropped from the
curriculum?” What is happening is
that the brains are getting sharper
than the curriculum, which needs
to be modified to fit them.

Our suggestion is a careful re-
examination of the needs and de-
sires of the contemporary freshman
in view of the demands made by
|a swift-moving society integrated
into a keyed-up world.

Next week we shall present a
possible revision of the curriculum
of the freshman year which seems to
| offer a great deal of potential in
modern educational concepts.

Generals 2-0
In CAC Play

Washington and Lee’s Generals
with a crucial 8-0 win over Sewanee
tucked under its belts—journey into
Tennessee this weekend for a Satur-
day night encounter with South-|
western at Memphis.

The 8 p.m. (Central Standard
Time) game will be the one that
decides the football championship
of the young College Athletic Con-
ference. The championship goes to
W&L if the Generals win, but a
victory for the Lynx would tie the
CAC title three ways. Sewanee has
two conference wins to its favor—|
Centre and Southwestern—and Sat- |
urday’s win for the Generals brought
them two CAC wins. The Lynx’s 20-|

Steve Hibbard Scores

Coach Lyles’ soccer team was
handed its second defeat of the
season, losing to the University of
Virginia, 7-2, last Tuesday in Lex-
ington.

Hibbard Scores Twice
Both of W&L’s goals were scored
by Steve Hibbard, bringing his per-
sonal total to seven for the season.
Freshman Tim Henry is the pres-
ent scoring leader for the team with
8 goals.

 

The Cavaliers seemed up for this
game as they played what is be-
lieved to be their best game of
the season. Jim Moore and Bob
Szabo led Virginia’s scoring at-
tack with two goals apiece.
