20 Scholarship Candid

ates

At W&L This Weekend

This weekend semi-finalist candidates for both the George |
F. Baker and the Robert E. Lee Scholarships are here in Lex- |
ington to be interviewed. Some twenty high school seniors

are expected here today.

Most of the applicants arrived Thursday, but there were
planned activities until this morning when the applicants had

private interviews. During both the*

morning and the afternoon, the visit-
ing students were taken to classes
and given tours of the W&L campus.
All these boys are considered
guests of the school and both their
transportation and meals have been
provided for by the school.
Saturday morning, some six or
seven finalists for the Baker Schol-
arships will be interviewed by the

Board of Trustees Selection Com-
mittee, consisting of Dr. John

Thomas of Richmond, Virginia, and
Dr. Huston St. Clair of Tazewell,
Virginia.

The George F. Baker Scholarships
are provided for by the George F.
Baker Trust of New York. This trust
fund provides some 500 college
freshmen scholarships of varying
amounts. Those given this year at
Washington and Lee may have sti-
pends of up to $1800 a year.

The Baker Scholarships have “no
limitations on the field of study
for candidates, but it is hoped that
some of the recipients may plan
eventual business careers.” Empha-
sis in selection of finalists is placed
on leadership and ability.

Five Robert E. Lee Scholarships
are awarded to incoming freshmen

 

 

each year. They carry stipends rang-

ing from $1,000 to $1,800 per year |
and are open to residents of Geor- |

gia, Kentucky North and South Car-
olina, Tennessee, and Virginia. With
Lee Scholarships, preference is giv-
en to students considering fields such
as teaching, public affairs, journal-
ism, and law.

The names of the scholarship ap-
plicants here this weekend are
Frank Smithson of Nashville, Tenn.;
Tom Holden of Richmond, Va.; Rich-
ard Johnston of Norfolk, Va.; Ron-
ald Shortt of Clintwood, Va.; Ted

Following his graduation here,
Korry went to work for the United
Press in New York City and went
abroad as a correspondent for that

Engstrom Describes Poetry
Influenced By Synaesthesia

By JIM LEDBETTER

Alfred G. Engstrom, visiting lec- |
turer for the forty-fourth Seminars
in Literature under the sponsorship
of the Department of Romance
Languages, entertained a_ sizeable
crowd last Wednesday with a lec-
ture entitled “Synaesthesia and the
Poetic Imagination.

Although a rather imposing word,
the phenomenon of synaesthesia is a
commonly known occurence to psy-
chologists. It occurs when a stimulus
to one sense produces a concomi-
tant sensation in a sense not being
stimulated. Dr. Engstrom spent the
first part of his lecture giving il-
lustrations of this phenomenon. One
example was noted by William James
in The Unity of the Senses in which
a subject’s vision improved when a|
tuning fork was brought close to his|
ear, and there have been many cases |
that show a fluctuation of other |
senses when this is tried.

 

Sense Associations

Many people” report colored|
sounds—the linking of a color with al
word, vowel, or voices; tonal vision, |
gustatory sounds, gemoetric colors
and even numbers. Dr. Engstrom |
told of a friend of his who identified!
the number ninty-eight with “a “
|

 

woman wearing pince-nez and sing-
ing the Magnificat.”

The purpose of his lecture was to
establish the prevalance of synaes-
thesia in poetry. Dr. Engstrom con-
tended that in this case, as in many
others, literature had far preceded

Beginning with Homer, he
examples such “speech

than honey,” and then
moved to the Greek tragedians
where he found Aeschylus talking |
of “trumpets that set all the shores |

and especially the French Symbol- |
ists Baudelaire and Rimbaud. In|
Illuminations, the later noted the)
colors of vowels—A black, E while, |
I red, U green, and O blue.

Dr. Engstrom noticed that Shakes-
peare often made fun of this type
of metaphorical language, though he
often used it himself.

Taking several themes, such as
silence and the sun, Dr. Engstrom
showed the variety of synaesthetic
response to them through the ages.
Silence has been referred to as black
dark, perfumed, chilled, cold and
sealy, violet, among other things.

Several explanations for synaes-
thesia have been offered. Bacon
thought that in the evolution of
man from a simple organism that
possessed only one sensory apparat-
us, a common link was maintained
between the present senses. Another
theory maintains that the sensory
nerves are close together in the
brain; another, that the phenomonon
due to childhood conditioning,
such as colored lettering-blocks.

In conclusion, Dr. Engstrom point-
ed out that synaesthesia is far more

1S

 

than a non-lingustic, primitive re-
sponse, as some feel it to be, but!
the basis for much of man’s art!
and poetry.

A Young Man’s Fancy...

Spring has always been viewed by man as the season of re-
birth, rejuvenation, gladness and panty raids.
But alas, the panty raid, and all that glorious tradition

behind it, has seen its day.

A whole new generation of college students has arisen

since that day—bettle-browed,
lectuals.

serious, grasping young intel-

Gone is the type of genius who a few years ago rewired
an entire school so that he singlehandedly controlled its entire
electrical supply. In his place is the double A plus student,
out to “make his mark on the world.”

Also gone is the type of enterprising young man, who,
some years ago at a mid-western college, was trying to suple-

ment his educational funds by

booking a burlesque queen to

appear during intermission at spring dances.

On the local scene things have changed too. Older heads
are often heard to remark how much the student body has
changed. It’s smarter, quieter—duller.

Even in the few years we've been here things have changed.
We remember fondly a friendly battle with the fire depart-
ment in which that freshman class was worsted.

But no more. The new breed of mature, intellectual stu-
dent looks down his nose at such as that, sneers and says—
“Umph! How much more fun to discuss God and sex and
solve world problems,” in the one night a week he allots to

such frivolity.

And so, there we are. Stuck with our pious pseudo little
intellect. What spawned him? That’s a bit hard to say. Perhaps
a similar mistaken sense of values that spawned his extreme

opposite.

However, lest anyone accuse us of seeking a regression—
well goodness sakes, that’s just the farthest thing from our
mind. And anyone who thought of a panty raid to Southern
Sem—to you, sir, horribly fearful remonstrations. Is that any

way for a W&L gentleman etc.,

etc.?

It just seemed to us this spring that there were one or two
things besides grades, but then that’s what spring does to one.

—C. C. F.

Dance teal Congratulated

Congratulations are in order for the Dance Board. They’ve
come up with a fine bill of entertainment for the Spring

Concerts.

This is not merely a gratuitous little slap on the back, but
sincerely meant. In the past there have been some pretty lousy
bills—perhaps unavoidable at times, but nevertheless we’ve

had them.

This Springs it should be different. If the entertainers live
up to their advance notices, we’re in for a fine weekend.

There’s something here to suit a variety of tastes. For the
folk music fans, there will be Odetta, a top artist in her field,
and the Journeymen. And for rock ’n roll fans Bo Diddley is

to play.

The second performer on the Saturday concert has not yet
been announced, but if he equals his fellow performers it will

be a top show.

Sem Quartet, Paramount Quintet
Comprise The Local Talent Finds

By PETE ALFORD

We feel we must report there ex-
ists a minor flourishing of singing

talent on the W&L

Se

r singing craze that
‘ the country is go-
* ing through has
- caused countless
numbers of imi-
tators to don
open sport shirts
and weejons, strap
a guitar around
their necks and
form a “group.”

Several of the
W&L variety folk singers have been
performing at the College Inn on
Friday nights and they have been
quite good. A quartet from Sem,
appropriately called The Hungry
Hill Singers has been booked for
tonight so the thing must be catch-
ing on.

Also Athletic Talent

Not only can the invigorating at-
mosphere of the Lexington area
bring out the singer in a person,
but also the athlete. Doing research
in the Paramount Inn the other
evening, we got to talking to Ron-
old Thompson, “player”-coach of the
Paramount's highly rated basketball
team.

Boasting an 18-1 win-loss record,
the quintet is presently competing in
the Y.M.C.A.’s gold medal cham-
pionship in Staunton. They have
captured two wins already in the
tourney and need only two more
to take the crown.

Boasts Three All-Staters

The team, which won last Wednes-
day 78-47 over a Charlottesville

campus. The folk

contingent, boasts of three former
B-V all-staters, former W&L play-
ers Mal Lassman, law student Jay
Gordon, and just recently Bip Faub-
er, in its ranks; also, guard Buck
Stimet, a B-V resident who will
have to leave the team for baseball
spring training in Florida. Stimet
is a pitcher for a double-A Phillies
farm club.

The Paramount five take the court
Monday in Staunton at the Y.M.C.A.
looking for another win which will
bring them closer to the title.

We trust our colleagues on the
Sports page aren’t offened that we
entered their realm for a paragraph
or two.

Forum Sertes
Is Sponsored

By Church

The Frontier Forums series at the
Lexington Presbyterian Church is
now half completed. The second
series of four meetings was held
Sunday.

The series consists of three dis-
cussion groups which meet at all
four programs. These discussions are
continuous, but they have enough
unity for each meeting to be com-
plete within itself.

Purpose of Forums

The purpose of the forums is to
enable students to discuss topics of
interest in small groups conducive
to participation. The forums are not
intended to give pat, pious answers
but to provide the opportunity for
intellectual exploration of current
situations.

“The World, the Word, and the
Sacrament” is led by Jim Campbell
with the Rev. L. W. Strickler serv-
ing as advisor. Based on In the
Middle of the World by Drew Uni-
versity’s Howard C. Kee, this forum
investigates the place of the church
in the twentieth century.

Church and Economics

“The Church and the Economic
Order” is directed by Pete Weaver
and Washington and Lee economics
professor J. M. Gunn, Jr. The source
is The Church and Change, a report
of the Fourth National Study Con-
ference comprised of economists
and church leaders. Topics such as
labor unions, socialism, communism
and Christianity are discussed.

Jere Cravens and Dean E. C. At-
wood lead “You in the University.”
Based on Alex Miller’s Faith and
Learning, this forum studies the
Christian’s role of reason as an aid
to faith and the university’s place
in Western society.

The next program will be held
April 21 at 7 p.m. in the student
lounge of the Presbyterian Church.
Students of any faith are welcome.

Placement
Notices

The following companies will have
representatives on the Washington
and Lee campus to interview sen-
iors who may be interested in ca-
reers with their organizations.

Editor's note: Robert Holland is
a senior journalism major at
Washington and Lee. His trip to
Washington was made possible by
a Reader's Digest travel grant to
the journalism department. A ful-
ler, more objective report of his
interviews appeared in last Sun-
day’s Richmond Times-Dispatch,
for which he is a local correspon-
dent. In this article he gives a
more personal report of his ex-
periences.

By ROBERT HOLLAND

A reporter inexperienced in the
mysterious ways of Washington’s
political thickets, yet covering a two-
day assignment there, may draw im-
mediate comparisons between the
capital city’s network of streets and
the hectic pace of our legislators’
daily routines.

Both bustle with seemingly end-|
less business, wind into confusing
circular patterns and (if slightly
cynical observations will be par-
doned) seem to lack a logical, com-
prehensible destiny.

Streets Do Lead Somewhere

But more practical persons tell us
that D.C.’s streets do indeed lead
somewhere other than original
starting points and that our friends
the politicians are masters of the
country’s destiny. Perhaps. At any
rate, my assignment as a neophyte
Washington reporter entailed finding
what, if anything, a small segment
of the political complex had on its
mind, namely the Virginia Congres-
sional delegation.

Senator Harry Flood Byrd, vari-
ously described by friends and foes
as the czar of the nefarious Byrd
Machine and the Grand Old Man
who devours wild-eyed liberals for
breakfast, was perusing a mass of
papers piled on his desk when this
reporter wandered into view. He was
consuming neither Berryville apples
or wild-eyed liberals.

Byrd Tired

 

He did seem tired. Thirty years
of fighting the political wars cer-

tainly entitle anyone to a fair share
of gray hair and wrinkled brow.

Cautiously I asked the Senator
the question all Virginia wants to
know: Will Harry Byrd be a can-
didate for re-election in 1964? And
he gently gave me the answer being
dished out to other reporters, young
and old alike—‘“I haven’t decided.”

He expressed the opinion that Vir-
ginia voters are conservative, will
remain conservative and, implicitly,
will remain in the conservative Dem-
ocratic camp. After discussing his
opposition to Democratic President
Kennedy's budget, medicare and
mental health proposals and various
and sundry other programs, it was
off to a committee meeting to tangle
with liberals for Virginia’s senior
Senator and off to another office
for the reporter.

In House Office Building

Across the way, in the House of
Representatives Office Building the
reporter found a_ strange young
Congressman by the name of W. Pat
Jennings of the Ninth District. Jen-
nings, by Virginia standards, had
some almost subversive things to
say. He dared to suggest that the
state re-examine its traditional pay-
as-you-go policies, that state Dem-
ocrats should also be national Dem-
ocrats, and that (horror of horrors)
Virginia has its problems.

“We need a more vigorous party,
with wider participation. We are not
appealing to younger people. We
need more vigor in presenting the
image of the present party,” (Where
have we heard about vigor before?).

A handsome, vigorous young man,
Jennings is considered as one of the
leaders in a movement to orient
state Democrats toward a more pro-
gressive frame of mind. Whether he
will succeed or not may be de-
cided by the upcoming elections in
which the poll tax should be gone
from the scene, along with blank
paper registration. An increase in
the number of voting Virginians may
be the wedge for political change.

Judge Howard Smith
The last man in the world who

 

Student Reporter In D.C.
Interviews State Solons

would agree with Jennings also oc-
cupies an office in the House Office
Building. He’s Judge Howard W.
Smith, the cagey, aged Congress-
man from the Eighth District who
runs a corollary agency of Con-
fress known as the House Rules
Committee.

He, like Byrd, informed me that
the people of the state are conser-
vative, love the Byrd organization,
and want to live blissfully in a
balanced budget.

“We don’t want to do a lot of
the theoretical experimenting the
White House is recommending,”

Smith said.

To emphasize his point, he picked
up a copy of the President’s budget,
acidly remarked that it went on
and on for something like 1200 pages,
and shoved it aside to a corner of
his desk. The reporter got a distinct
impression that Smith would like
to eliminate approximately nine-
tenths of the budget.

Robertson of Lexington

Senator Byrd’s cohort, junior Sen-
ator A. Willis Robertson of Lexing-
ton, also looked with disfavor on
re-organizing the state party for
the logical reason that he, Senator
Robertson has been elected to every
office he has run for on the Dem-
ocratic ticket since 1915 and there-
fore “I would be the last to say
that I’m dissatisfied with the party
and want it reorganized.”

Who said Washington and Lee has
a monopoly on “gravy train” poli-

The other Congressmen were help-
ful and courteous to the wandering
reporter, as were all of our Vir-
ginians in Washington. However,
their remarks were _ predictably
“Byrdian,” for the most part.

With enough material to write a
story for his newspaper, the weary
reporter struggled to find his way
out of the maze of capital building
subways, dodged the droves of tur-
ists, got lost for more than an hour
in Washington traffic, and finally
found the road to Lexington.

 

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Freedom and service are two sep-
arte and distinct concepts; yet they
can, and should, be seen as inter-
related and even mutually depen-
dent.

In his book, Escape from Freedom,
Dr. Erich Fromm points out tht the
conditions of modern civilization
affect man in two ways: we become
more independent, self-reliant, and
critical, and at the same time we
become more isolated, alone and
afraid. Without going to the extreme
of viewing history as man’s struggle
for freedom and _ individuality, one
would have to admit that through
the centuries men in general have
become more and more free from ex-
ternal domination.

Men in industrialized, “modern”
nations are no longer controlled by
irrational fears of the unknown. Our
society is not completely regulated
by external authority as were the
civilizations of the Egyptians, the
Mayas, and Incas. Our lives are not
directed by external authority,
whether it be of church or state, or
by tradition, a form of control found
in most “primitive” or small, iso-
lated cultures.

Besides gaining freedom from ex-
ternal authority, men have also
gained a large measure of freedom
from compulsive or conditioned in-
ternal control. The inner-directed
man of the American frontier days
is no longer with us. Today, through
psychoanalysis, psychology, sociolo-
gy, and other studies, men are be-
coming more aware of themselves;
we can discover the mainsprings of
our actions and can then eriticize
ourselves and attempt to alter the
course of our lives by changing our
thoughts and deeds.

Thus modern men find themselves

 

 

in a situation of “freedom from”—

 

 

they have freedom from imposed
external authority, irrational fears,
and compulsive inner direction. But
this condition of freedom is a fright-
ening one; for when one comes to see
himself as being distinct from other
individuals and the world in gen-
eral, that is, not merely a discrete
physical entity, but a unique person,
similar to but different from his
fellows, he is often overwhelmed by
doubts and fears, a raging insecuri-
ty and aloneness; in isolation, one
becomes afraid. This increasing iso-
lation and the intense’ feeling of
aloneness which result from it. is
the basis of the existentialist predic-
ament.

Now if one finds himself in the
position of “freedom from” and iso-
lation, what can he do? The over-
whelming desire of a person in this
condition is to find security and re-
lief, to become re-oriented to the
world in a meaningful way. There
are two basic ways to do this: one
results in continued frustration, the
other in the fullest possible develop-
ment of the individual and_ his
unique emotional, sensual, and intel-
lectual potentialities.

The first way to find security is
to attempt to escape from freedom.
One can do this by submitting him-
self to an external, authoritarian
control, as men do when they devote
themselves to a cause, blindly and
irrationally, in an attempt to find a
meaning in life and an individual
importance by drowning themselves
in some “higher” effort; the cause
or external authority may be an au-
thoritarian regime which parades it-
self as representing the inevitable
march of history, or it might be sub-
mission to a God or religion which
dogmatically asserts that it has “the
Answer,” etc.

A second escape is destructiveness

 

A Modern Man’s Dilemma:
The Escape From Freedom

or, as Karen Horney calls it, aggres-
sion; one gains a feeling of super-
iority over something by destroying
or damaging it, by asserting one’s
control over it. The third form of
escape, and the one which Fromm
asserts to be dominant in America,
is automation conformity; the con-
formity may be to specific condi-
tions, rules, or regulations or to an
anonymous authority which is large-
ly an imaginative one composed of
the dictates of the mass media and
“other-direction.” In this latter case,
the individual would regulate his
behavior according to what he
thought the “others” expected him to
do; he would act if he thinks the
“others” would approve and would
inhibit action or feel guilty about
acting if he thought they would dis-
approve.

Above I said that these were “at-
tempts” to escape; they are merely
attempts and not actual escapes, be-
cause they are not psychologically
satisfying to the individual. The per-
son who escapes to authoritarianism,
destruction or aggresison, or con-
formity, can never be satisfied by
this condition, for he still realizes, or
at least feels, senses, that his true
self, his individuality, is being in-
hibited repressed, suppressed, dom-
inated by other forces. Having tasted
freedom, one cannot be satisfied
without it.

The other way to become re-ori-
ented to the world when one finds
himself in a position of “freedom
from” and isolation is this: one must
realize tht he is a free, unique indi-
vidual and make the free and ra-
tional choice, based on knowledge,
to relate himself voluntarily to the
world and to his fellow men through
love and work. In freedom, one must
have the courage to accept the re-

Marshall Research Library

The Ford Foundation has an-
nounced a gift of $200,000 to the
George Marshall Research Founda-
tion for use by the projected Mar-
shall Research Library when com-
pleted.

The grant is the largest yet made
to the foundation since its estab-
lishment ten years ago. The founda-
tion established in memory of the
late George C. Marshall has re-
ceived nearly $1 million in gifts.

The terms of the Ford Foundation
grant stipulated that the money is
to be used for research into United
States military and diplomatic his-
tory.

At present the foundation has ap-
proximately $450 available toward
construction of the library to be
built near the Virginia Military In-
stitute parade grounds. Marshall was
a VMI graduate.

Construction work on the library
is due to begin this spring with
completion expected by June 1 next
year.

The research library will be a

to do what we ought.” There are
some tricky issues here, but it is a
statement worth pondering. Basically
this is the problem: in freedom one
can make choices; the choices are
these—one may attempt to escape the
burden of freedom, which choice
leads to further frustration; he may
choose to do nothing (this is the
freedom not to choose), which so-
lution leads to the despair of un-
bearable isolation; and, finally there
is the choice to accept oneself as
a unique being, to affirm the social
nature and brotherhood of all men,
and to relate oneself freely and
and spontaneously to others through
love and work.

It is only by choosing this third
course, by choosing service to others
as a way of life, as did Faust, that
one may maintain his freedom and
individuality and attain the satis-
faction of personal creativity and
helping others develop their full
sensual, emotional, and intellectual
potentialities.
