IFC Nixes
Pledging

Proposals

By RANDY JONES

The IFC unanimously approved a
1.0 grade point ratio for freshman
initiates last night, at the same time
rejecting four other proposals.

The second proposal—that all
freshmen having less than a 4 at
mid-semester be automatically sus-
pended from pledge duties, dropped
from the fraternity roles, and inelig-
ible to be rushed by any other fra-
ternity during this suspension—was
defeated by a 12 to 6 vote.

Reasons for its defeat were that
those affected would probably be
permanently separated from the fra-
ternity, which would harm not only
the fraternity but the individuals
concerned. Also, the eligibility for
initiation of those attaining a 1.0
grade point ratio at the end of the
semester would be seriously threat-
ened.

Third Proposal Falls Flat

Drafted as an attempt to combat
the sophomore academic lag, the
third proposal received no support.
The failure to make a .75 in either
semester of the freshman year would
prohibit a sophomore from living or
eating in the house, and cause him
to be dropped from the fraternity
roles, under this motion.

It was amended that the meal
clause of this proposal be dropped |
and Dean Atwood replied _ that, |
“Some sophomores would be re-
warded by not being required to
live in the house.”

Defeat of this proposal was close-
ly related to the ruling that all
concerned must be depledged if |
they were to be dropped from the |
fraternity rolls.

Pian Called Useless

One IFC member added that by
the sophomore year, the student has

usually established his pattern of |

study and that this plan would mag representing 416 students and

| 138 guests
| that may come in the next week.

a useless punishment for the fra-
ternity and the individual.

The last two proposals were au-
tomatically defeated because of their
relationship to the third: Those be-
low a .75 are to be placed on fra-
ternity scholastic probation; and
When a student achieves a .75 the
probation is immediately lifted.

In order for the 1.0 grade point
ratio ruling to become an addition to
the IFC constitution, it must be
again approved at the next xt meeting.

Freshmen Will Have Representation on Committee

A freshman will be appointed to a student body committee for the first
time, Monday, Executive Committee president Tim Ireland has announced.
Freshmen may apply this week for position on the Assimilation Committee,
he said. Applications should be sent to Lanny Butler,
include the applicant’s qualifications.

Assimilation Committee Chairman Bill Noell has long advocated the
placement of a freshman on his committee. The move is being made to
broaden the plane of student representation in the hope of increased

cooperation from the freshmen.

gressman from the seventh district.

Thirty-eight W&L Young Re-
publicans and a group of twenty-
four from Sweetbriar took part in
the three hour canvass.

They passed out a campaign pub-
lication entitled “The Robinson
Courier,’ a newspaper expressing
and other po-
litical literature.

Emphasis was placed upon invit-
ing people to attend the rally tonight
at 8 p.m. at Lexington High School.
Interested students are invited to
attend and meet Mr. Robinson at a

for publicity purposes.

Dr. C. F. Phillips, the club’s fac-
ulty advisor, was cited by Club
President Bob Wheelock for his as-
sistance with the club. Dr. Phillips is
also handling publicity for Robin-
son’s campaign.

John Lundy, John Tipson (cor-

A New Paper,
‘The Question,’
Blasts Campus

By SHANNON JUNG

The Question, a new radical sheet,
was first introduced to the W&L
campus last night by co-editors
Dick Herman, President of the Phi
Epsilon Pi House, and by Lamar
Lamb, Sophomore Executive Com-
mitteeman.

The stated purpose of The Ques-
tion is “to provide an outlet for
opinion on topics of a local, national,
and international nature.” Citing the
limit of its subject matter as the
limit of the imagination, the co-edi-
tors solicit ideas and contributions
of any nature.

The motivation for initiating this
sheet is, as the publication states,
to make it possible for those un-
represented by “the vested interests”
to express themselves.

The second motivation is the
avoidance of such repressions as
domination of campus media by

minority interests.

In the first article, by co-editor
Dick Herman, The Question criticiz-
es the E.C’s policy of keeping cer-
tain matters (e.g., an affair con-
cerning the Honor System and the
ABC store) and the E.C.’s decision
about such matters as clandestine
as possible.

The sheet goes on to criticize the
E.C.’s not wishing to take a stand
on the issue—one way or another.

Since Lamb is a member of the
EC, the editors are well able to
promise full and accurate coverage
of all EC meetings.

The Question congratulates the
EC for including athletics under the
Honor System.

Identifying the prevailing attitude
on the W&L campus as conservatism,
the paper gives
to back up this statement.

a comfortable majority of 153 to

*106 over the Independent Party’s
Joe Miller. However, he was not
supported by a majority of his class-
mates, 74 of whom failed to cast
a_ ballot.

Only 78 per cent of the freshman
class voted in the election, giving
Watson 46 per cent of the total
class vote.

Freshman law student Myers won
by a count of 22 to 14 over Roger
Kelsey after a preliminary ballot-
ing had narrowed the field.

Other freshmen law class officers
were also chosen last night: Mike
Bowerman was elected president;
Andy Anderson, vice president; Ley-
burn Mosby, secretary; and Roger
Kesley, historian.

For the University Party, it was
a continuation of the nearly com-
plete domination it has exhibited
since the Independents won a ma-
jority of student body offices at
the end of the 1960-61 school year.
More important the election was a
highly successful test of a political
alignment which included the Sig-
ma Phi Epsilon house for the first
time.

For Watson it was a brilliant vic-
tory over an opponent who was so
well known in the class and had
presented such an imposing list of
qualifications that many considered
him the favorite in spite of his nom-
ination by the minority party. Miller
had won the name contest at Fresh-
man Camp and had been elected a
co-captain of the freshman football
team.

The percentage of voting freshmen,
lowest in years, may reflect the
presence of a high number of non-
fraternity men in the class, since
fraternities push hard to get out a
vote for their party candidate. Or
it could reflect apathy resulting from
the unequal lineup, which had dis-
couraged interest among the minori-
ty party and among non-fraternity
students.

There was, as usual in freshman
elections, no real issue involved.

Nevertheless Watson in particu-
| lar campaigned hard, and his elec-
| tion is apparently the reward for
his efforts. He had visited every UP
fraternity and had canvassed the
| dorm in detail. This vigorous cam-
paigning has not been a Big Clique
| habit in past freshman classes, and

Watson could well have based his
campaign on the memory of the In-
dependent sweep in the freshman
| class last spring. In elections for
' sophomore offices, the Independents
dorm and carried on
|a person-to-person campaign to
| decisively defeat the overconfident
UP candidates.

Watson made no comment on his
election other than to describe him-
self “extremely pleased” at the out-
come. He carries a bright high school
record into office .

Davis became interested in the
setting of the story through the fact
that his great-grandfather actually
was one of the unit to which the
story's main character belongs. The
outfit was called McClausland’s Cav-
valry, and was a full brigade under
the command of Brig. Gen John
McClausland, a VMI graduate and
relative of Davis’ grandfather.

In “The Deadlier Bruise” the Mc-
Clausland brigade is depicted as the

the |

main striking arm of Jubal Barly in
the 1864 Valley Campaign. The unit
| is sent on a raid of Pennsylvania
and burned the town of Chambers-
burg, as in fact it did in 1864. On
its way back from this raid, Mc-
Clausland’s Cavalry was trapped and
attacked during the night by a
Yankee outfit which killed or cap-
tured nearly the entire Confederate
brigade. The battle took place at
what is now Mooresfield, West Vir-
ginia.

Davis has written novel, Two

An Answer
For “The Question’

We note with interest the debut of a new campus publica-
tion entitled The Question, and rather presumptuously sub-
titled “Freedom and Responsibility in an Expanding Uni-
verse.” Its format will be familiar to those who have followed
Protest, and its emergence promises a new campaign to combat
campus apathy.

The editors, Dick Herman and Lamar Lamb, have, in
their first issue, assured themselves of at least a mild contro-
versy by taking a poke at the Ring-tum Phi’s coverage of EC
meetings, and by insinuating that we are a “vested interest.”
Quite naturally, we feel obliged to answer:

1.Three out of four EC meetings are boring affairs. They
deal with very trivial matters, and their coverage in the Ring-
tum Phi would be a waste of space.

2. In regard to Herman’s diatribe on the EC’s ABC store
decision: both editors of the Ring-tum Phi agreed that Mr.
Herman’s understanding of the Honor System was woefully
inadequate, and that his letter irresponsibly misrepresented
the facts. The student government had nothing to do with the
editors’ decision to turn down the letter.

In conclusion, we would like to toss out a little truism
that the editors of The Question might ponder in their next
issue: raising questions is not particularly difficult, but pro-
viding answers sometimes requires a little thought.

Reflections On Beanies

Judging by the College Board scores, this year’s Freshman
class is the most intellectually sophisticated class in W&L’s
history—and judging by Bill Noell’s excellent article in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi, this class is too sophisticated to wear
beanies.

Are beanies so degrading? Are we asking too much when
we ask that freshmen admit they are freshmen by wearing
beanies? Is the wearing of beanies a barbaric ordeal?

A great many freshmen seem to think so.

Thus the student body has only one alternative: let fly
with the assimilation cards.

The Conservative Society

The ideology of American conservatism, hitherto little
known to the majority of W&L students, has come more to
light in recent months. In the latter half of the past year and
already in the opening weeks of the new term members of
Washington and Lee’s Conservative Society have made com-
mendable steps toward setting forth the doctrines of their
political philosophy.

Whether or not we happen to concur with the policies of
the conservatives, members of the Conservative Society de-
serve a pat on the back for the excellent speakers such as Rus-
sell Kirk, that they have brought to W&L and for the continu-
ing hard work that is so obvious in the fruits of their attempts to

 

spread the appeal of conservative thinking.

NAACP Defended

Dear Editors and Mr. Miller,

Perhaps I can bring to light that

 

“some information” you're looking
for. The NAACP is a logical organ-
ization of leadership for a group
which has been stepped on and
down-trodden since its presence on
this soil.

The NAACP began to grow in
1954 to counter those southern forces
which were preventing the colored
person from attaining his inherent
civil rights.

Those states with weaker tradi-
tions of discrimination complied with
the court orders of desegregation.
But in those regions in which the
links, or shackles, whichever you
prefer, of narrow-mindedness and
blind acceptance of habit were too
strong to be broken by moral values
or a court order, the state of the
Negro remained the same as ever.

The efforts of the NAACP have|
succeeded only in alienating the
Negro from those people who were
in earnest opposition to the Negro’s
gaining the same rights as the white
people.

I do admit that your statement
“whenever the NAACP enters a new
campaign it is almost certain that)
there will be trouble and violence,’ |
is quite true. However, this violence |
has been propagated by the whites, |
the NAACP didn’t organize the riots |
at Oxford.

Concerning headlines: How does}
this group thrive on them? National |
attention to the problems at Oxford |
simply worsened matters by en-|
couraging more people to enter both)
the verbal and physical conflicts. |

Many people ask why the NAACP |
won't accept gradual step by step |
integration. The answer is that it}
will, when offered this opportunity. |
It did happen in St. Louis and Mem-
phis. In the majority of segregated |
cities the local officials absolutely |
refuse to discuss even gradual inte-|
gration, as in Albany, Ga.,

 

South |
Carolina and Mississippi.

The answer which I believe the |
NAACP is in favor of is a gradual
integration on a three-level system
(superior, average, below average) |
which would allow each person to|
advance according to his capabilities. |

Of course, this reasonable pace |
will be too fast for a snail but the}
change has to come and it might as|
well begin right now.

ing for 50 cents, Esquire declared
on the credits page of Vol. I, No. 1,
that “Esquire aims to become the
common denominator of masculine
interests—to be all things to all
men.” And tody, that’s just what the
magazine is.

It was a big and flashy periodical,
with 36 features in full color—color
as technically good as that used in
most of today’s slicks.

But it was impressive in another
way, for splattered all over the
cover were names of the contribu-
tors: articles by Hemingway, Ring
Lardner and Nicholas Murray But-
ler; fiction by, among others, John
Dos Passos, Marley Callaghan,
Erskine Caldwell and Douglas Fair-

Gene Tunney and Bobby Jones
had sports features in the first Es-

Audrey Wurdemann had _ written
some good verse for the magazine’s
debut.

There were 37 cartoons in the first
Esquire, ten concerned with sex and
about 20 smacking of the Great De-

The advertisements haven’t chang-

then, as they are now, classy, elite
and voguish.

America cower before all Soviet
threats. What I am suggesting is that
we recognize that the Soviet Union

tion of Cuba and that it is not in
our interest to let Mr. K. paint him-

atomic diplomacy to force “show-

avoiding them. After all, what hap-
pens if we don’t back down at all
and neither do they? An atomic
blast is, I think, the answer, and
who has a future after that?

A “Peaceful Blockade”

Is there not then some measure
short of invasion that will get us
rid of Castro? Senator Goldwater
suggests a “peaceful blockade.” It
is former President Eisenhower who
answered this when he said he “had

never heard of a peaceful block-
ade.” The general is right: Inter-

national Law defines a blockade as

 

e Cuban Situation?

“an act of war.” Just last week
Congress released figures on just
whose ships are docking at Cuban
ports. Great Britain, Spain and Nor-
way headed the list. West Germany
was just below them. A_ blockade
would likely get us in trouble with
our Allies. What profit for us is in
this?

I would suggest (as others have
suggested) that we should neither
invade nor blockade, though we
should prepare to do both if the
situation worsens. Righ now, let Mr.
Castro stew in his own juice. His
economy is in collapse. He is a drain
on the Soviet Union who must con-
tinuously bail him out of his self-
inflicted catastrophes and who may
well tire of this game. He poses no
military threat to the United States
(a rocket in Moscow can hit Wash-
ington well as one based in
Cuba) and there is no military au-
thority I know who seriously claims
otherwise.

In summation, Mr. Castro annoys
us. No doubt about this at all, But a!

as

 

| This

great nation can stand some annoy-
ing. It takes a bit of learning, but
it can be done. In the meantime, we
can hand Mr. Castro his fair share
of rope, and in its own way, and
contrary to its own purposes, the
Soviets will hand him rope, too.
Let us give Mr. Castro every op-
portunity to hang himself. When his
economy comes down around his
ears and his people reach the “point
of no return,” then we can make our
moves with sureness and dispatch
and we can have our friends South
of the Border on our side and _ not

Keesee Gains 164 yards

With Keesee carrying for 164
yards in 19 carries and Yoffee reel-
ing off 93 yards in nine tries, the
Generals reminded of their awesome |
running attacks of the past two
years. In 55 plays the Generals
gained 336 yards, a neat 6.0 average |
per carry.

Despite this prolific ground game,
Washington and Lee had to resort to
its usually most ineffective wea-
pon—the pass—for its second touch-
down.

Here again Keesee was the hero. |

Taking a handoff from quarter- |
back Chuck Lane, Keesee lofted a
high 27-yard aerial to end Buck
Ogilvie, all alone in the end zone.

Fumbles spoiled two W&L drives
and four straight off tackle plays |
failed to get a first down at the |
Randolph-Macon 10 on _ another |
drive. |

W&L took the opening kickoff and |
needed only four minutes to go 70
yards for six points. Yoffe carried
the last 25 yards on a reverse around
left end.

Jackets Bounce Back

W&L’s lead was short lived, how-
ever, as Randolph-Macon quickly
proved what Emory and Henry
hinted last week—that W&L’s de-
fense couldn’t contain its opponents
too successfully.

The Yellow Jackets, after being
set back to their 15 on the ensuing
kickoff, marched 85 yards in 19 plays
to go ahead, 7-6.

On the third play of the drive
freshman quarterback Skip D’Al-
lesandro discovered the Generals
had a leaky pass defense when he
hit end Bill Bailey on a jump pass.

Nine plays and four successful
passes later the Jackets had third
and seven at the W&L 29.

Interference Costly

Again D’Allesandro faded to pass
to Bailey at the W&L 20. An over-
eager defender, however, shoved
Bailey and earned a pass interfer-
ence call.

D’Allesandro fired another pass,
sent halfback Don Way into the line
twice, fired two more aerials—the
last one a seven yarder to end
Charles Ashby—for the touchdown.
Harry Hulvey booted the extra point.

For the drive D’Allesandro com-
pleted eight passes in eight attempts.

Randolph-Macon regained posses-
sion quickly after the red team
failed to move the football.

The red team couldn’t hold the
Jackets either, as they moved from
their 35 to the W&L 30.

Blue Team Stars

With first and ten at the 30 the
blue unit entered the game. Led by
Mike Sheffey, Bob Payne, Keesee,
Jim Sylvester, and George Gossman,
the first team halted the Jackets four
inches short of a a first down.

HAPPINESS CAN’T BUY MONEY

Can education bring happiness?

This is a question that in recent years has caused much
lively debate and several hundred stabbings among American
college professors. Some contend that if a student’s intellect
is sufficiently aroused, happiness will automatically follow.
Others say that to concentrate on the intellect and ignore the
rest of the personality can only lead to misery.

I myself favor the second view, and I offer in evidence the
well-known case of Agathe Fusco.

Agathe, a forestry major, never got anything less than a
straight “A”, was awarded her B.T. (Bachelor of Trees) in
only two years, her M.S.B. (Master of Sap and Bark) in only
three, and her D.B.C. (Doctor of Blight and Cutworms) in
only four.

Academic glory was hers. Her intellect was the envy of
every intellect fan on campus. But was she happy? The
answer, alas, was no. Agathe—she knew not why—was miser-
able, so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking across
campus, she was suddenly so overcome with melancholy that
she flang herself, weeping, upon the statue of the Founder.

By and by a liberal arts major named R. Twinkle Plenty came
by with his yoyo. He noted Agathe’s condition. “How come
you're so unhappy, hey?” said R. Twinkle.

“Suppose you tell me, you dumb old liberal arts major,”
replied Agathe peevishly.

   

a ile
. cae vatrever Sted 4. Pealboro’ cU6CLE: r

“All right, I will,” said R. Twinkle. “You are unhappy for
two reasons. First, because you have been so busy stuffing
your intellect that you have gone and starved your psyche. I’ve
got nothing against learning, mind you, but a person oughtn’t
to neglect the pleasant, gentle amenities of life—the fun
things. Have you, for instance, ever been to a dance?”

Agathe shook her head.

‘Have you ever watched a sunset? Written a poem? Smoked
a Marlboro Cigarette?”

Agathe shook her head.

“Well, we'll fix that right now!” said R. Twinkle and gave her
a Marlboro and struck a match.

She puffed, and then for the first time in twelve or fifteen
years, she smiled. ‘‘Wow!”’ she cried. ‘““Marlboros are a fun thing!
What flavor! What filter! What pack or box! What a lot to
like! From now on I will smoke Marlboros, and never have
another unhappy day!”

“Hold!” said R. Twinkle. “Marlboros alone will not solve
your problem—only half of it. Remember I said there were
two things making you unhappy?”

“Oh, yeah,” said Agathe. “What's the other one?”

“How long have you had that bear trap on your foot?”
said R, Twinkle.

“T stepped on it during a field trip in my freshman year,”
said Agathe. “I keep meaning to have it taken off.”

‘Allow me,” said R. Twinkle and removed it.

“Land sakes, what a relief!” said Agathe, now totally happy,
and took R, Twinkle’s hand and led him to a Marlboro vendor's
and then to a justice of the peace.

Today Agathe is a perfectly fulfilled woman, both intellect-
wise and personalitywise. She lives in
house with R. Twinkle and their 17 children,
busy in the forestry game. Only last month, in fact, reECUINE

Southerner’s ... deep-sez ae
guilt over his denial to the
Negro of basic human and sanitiltis |
tional rights.”

In seeking to explain the violence
and bloodshed surrounding events |
at Ole Miss, Dr. Hodges answers the |
question “why did it occur?” with |
this analysis: Southerners, he asserts,
an inner conflict between a be-
lief in the moral rightness of segre-|
and the sense of guilt grow-
“out of the conflict between
democratic creed and his racist prac-
tice.”

Interestingly enough, there was in
Dr. Hodges’ comments only one ref-
erence to constitutional rights. Does |
this indicate that he believes no}
constitutional question to be in-|
volved other than the rights of the |
Southern Negro?

If so—and if the problem was root-
ed in some psycho-religious conflict |
of the racist Southerner—then his |
argument will have both credibility |
and cogency for the naive, the un-
suspecting.

But we suggest that Southern mo- |
tives are more pointedly focused on
something Dr. Hodges overlooked
the constitutional rights, not only of
James Meredith, but also of the
State of Mississippi.

We suggest noting: 1) that
regulation and administration — of
education is a state function, since
“not delegated to the United States
by the Constitution, nor prohibited
by it to the States” (Amendment X);
2) thus the exercise of federal jur-
isdiction in Mississippi can be consti-
tutionally justified only by the
“equal protection” clause of Amend- |
ment XIV; 3) an amendment which, |
while the Supreme Court has ev: aded |
passing on the legality of the issue, |
was ratified, at bayonet point, by |
