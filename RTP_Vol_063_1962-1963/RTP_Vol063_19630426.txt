Steve Semesco Finishes Second

Miss Leake topped her nearest opponent by 84 votes.

The final results were: Anne Leake 205, Steve Semesco

the 34-year his-

elected to that of-
fice.

In a simple and
direct campaign
speech last night
in Doremus Gym-
nasium, she told
the delegates “I
want to be your

have it.” A show-
campaign confetti then fell on the
dance floor.

MANAGED NEWS

One of the warmest fires currently roasting the New Fron-
tier is being used by the press and some of its critics who accuse
the Kennedy Administration of “managing” the news through
what, if some descriptions are accurate, are almost Gestapo
tactics. FBI men trailing reporters in the halls of the Pentagon,
Air Force investigating teams asking that Defense Department
officials submit to lie detector tests to find out who leaked
a memo, and other practices of this nature smack rather
strongly of a police state.

This is not the first Administration to manage the news.
Others have done so in the past, and we're sure it will be done
to some extent in the future. There’s really nothing to stop it,
no law says a government source must tell a reporter all he
knows, if he’s sure the reporter doesn’t know what's being held
back.

There are reasons for government secrecy in some things.
Such areas as defense specifications, missile qualities, and other
things which might help an enemy catch or surpass us in the
cold or a possible hot war are perfectly legitimate things to be
withheld.

The disturbing thing is the possibility that some officials
may be hiding, under the guise of security, their own incom-
petencies.

There are many ways to manage news, besides clamping a
“security”? heading down on it. This Administration is making
frequent use of its police powers to do the job. Federal agents
have visited the homes of reporters and other newspaper em-
ployees in attempts to question them about their sources. Some
reporters say they have been shadowed in the halls of the
Pentagon, and many believe their telephones to be tapped.

The Administration says the free-wheeling investigations
have been for the purpose of plugging security leaks. Hanson
Baldwin, writing on the subject in the April issue of The
Atlantic, points out that the stories which got into print have
in almost all cases been fully known to most foreign powers,
including the Russians. And, Baldwin adds, most of the stories
have embarrassed the Kennedys.

We can’t entirely absolve the press from blame for this
management of news. Too often, with governments becoming
more and more complex and spread out further, reporters are
contenting themselves with the handouts from public rela-
tions men or information officers, and not bothering to go
further, to check the story out to see how many grains of truth
it contains. They fail to do any work on their own, they prefer
to be spoonfed. To be sure, it’s hard to get a complete picture
when the elements are diffused, but some checking can be done.
As Baldwin says, “it is imperative that enterprising reporters
continue to break through the wall of secrecy around govern-
ment. When no leak occurs, I shall ll really begin to worry.”

A WORD OF THANKS

Running the Southern Interscholastic Press Association’s
annual meeting is something like putting out a daily newspaper.
The closer one gets to deadline time, the more panic sets in.

Most of our guests see things run, we hope, fairly smoothly.
There are occasional slips, to be sure, when name tags are lost
or speakers fail to appear in the right place at the right time.
But for the most part we try to keep our slips to ourselves, and
present an efficient-looking operation.

The man chiefly responsible for this is SIPA Executive Di-
rector John K. Jennings, by now a veteran of this event. He
is quite accustomed to planning programs, checking times,
and then having to fill in some place in case of accidents. To
him goes much of the credit, not only for the SIPA programs
which we hope you enjoyed, but for the radio shows described
elsewhere on this page. We hope some of you managed to
squeeze into our rather cramped quarters to observe them.

Another man to whom the Southern Interscholastic Press
Association can be grateful is our planner of short courses,
Associate Professor Paxton Davis of the Journalism Depart-
ment. Editor of the Sunday book page of the Roanoke Times,
he is also author of several books and numerous short stories.

To Professor O. W. Riegel, head of the Journalism Depart-
ment and a veteran of SIPA conventions since 1931, go thanks
for lining up the ‘three main speakers this weekend. And
there are always the people behind the scenes, the cogs in
our sometimes recalcitrant mechanism. Some of them you met
during registration (and wasn’t that hectic?), most of the rest
are listed in the staff box to the right.

Our last word of thanks, but far from the least, goes to
our print shop crew, the men who have to set what you've
been reading, make it up in page forms following frequently-
ridiculous instructions from the editor, and get it on the press
in time to distribute to you before you leave our campus. To
Superintendent C. Harold Lauck and his men; Linotype oper-
ator Lynwood Pullen, compositors Edward Backus and Edwin
Walker, and pressman Don Tabbut, our deepest thanks for
putting up with constant attempts to stretch a deadline, sloppy
writing, dirty copy, and our ingrained ability to make nuisances
of ourselves without really trying. Where we'd be without
them we don’t rightly know.

At any rate, SIPA is over for another year. We hope you
enjoyed it, and that some of you will come back next year for
another session. We’ll be expecting you.

“Good evening. This is Home Edi-
tion, your nightly news report from
the Washington and Lee Department
of Journalism and Communications.”

These words open, five nights a
week, a 15-minute news broadcast
assembled by the largest radio news
steff in the stste—Washington and
Lee’s Home Edition.

The broadeasts are a combination
of classroom laboratory and extra-
curricular activity. International,
national, state, local and sports news
are covered in the student broad-
easts .

Material for Home Edition comes
from the Associated Press teleprint-
er in the Journalism Department
newsroom, and from local copy
gathered by students in the depart-
ment’s reporting courses. Late-
breaking stories are covered by
ihe staff on duty.

On the air five nights a week,
Ilome Edition is often the first
source of local news, beating the
county weekly newspaper by sev-
cral days on a story. The W&L-
produced newscast is the last news
of the evening carried by radio
station WREL.

Local news is covered systemat-
ically on a series of “beats” which
include town and county govern-
mental offices, local, county and state
police headquarters, charitable or-

ganizations, Lexington’s two col-
leges, the five high schools in
the county, and local sports.

The copy thus produced is re-
written, as is the Associated Press
material, to produce a balanced pro-
gram consistent in form and style.
This is the job of the five nightly
staffs.

A typical night for the Home Edi-
tion staff finds the men on duty
reporting to the newsroom around
7:30 for work. Chances are the
senior editor for the evening has
been there a half-hour ahead, cut-

Once assigned their stories, the re-
porters settle down to their type-
writers for rewriting. The senior edi-
tor or one of his staff will prepare
a five-minute newscast to precede
the 8 p.m. Radio Washington and

The night often includes scurrying
around for that last big story on a
local fire or accident, taping Radio
Moscow broadcasts for “the other
side of the story,’ or the remarks
of the many prominent speakers
who come to Washington and Lee.

John Jennings

Again Directs
SIPA Activity

The massive task of handling the
organization of SIPA was conducted
by John K. Jennings, W&L assistant
professor in journalism and Execu-
tive Director of SIPA.

Once again this year, Jennings
held this important post—a_ position
which is a real year-round operation
since the planning for an SIPA con-
vention must stort as soon as the
previous year’s activity is finished.

As Jennings ean testify, the job is
often tedious one. He made the
first contacts with this year’s dele-
gates last November when 2,500
posteards were mailed to secondary
schools. The big mailing, however,
came in January when registration
forms, bulletins, and announcements
for the State Scholastic Press Asso-
