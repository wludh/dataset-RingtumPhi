SWMSFC Has Profitable Year;

Concert Will Be Annual Affair

As the current school year draws
to a close, the Student War Memor-
ial Scholarship Fund Committee has
completed one of its most successful
years since its founding. Past pres-
ident Frank Young and next year’s
president Randy Wootton were
pleased at the success of the cur-
rent fund raising campaigns.

Throughout the school year,
SWMSFC has promoted various sales
from which all profits enter the fund
which helps support a worthy stu-
dent while he attends W&L.

This year SWMSFC, as in the past,
has had control of the refreshment
sales at all University dances and
concerts. Before Christmas the com-
mittee conducted the sale of Christ-
mas Cards to students.

In the fall, SWMSFC was in charge

 

of the sale of class rings. From this
sale, the student committee profited
over $200. |
Annual Concert

The public concert, which featured |
the famous concert guitarist Charlie
Bird, was held for the first time this
year. From this concert $425 was
added to the treasury of the scholar-
ship fund. SWMSFC plans to con-
tinue to hold such concerts in the
future. The concert will be held
during an off week-end, and feature
famous jazz, or folk singing groups.

The sale of graduation invitations,
and the rental of caps and gowns
to seniors also conducted by mem-
bers of SWMSFC. This year a new
feature has been added to the rental
of graduation costumes. A_ senior

From all sales and campaigns and
the concert, SWMSFC plans to pro-
fit about $1200 this year.

Next year, this student organi-
zation plans to continue all sales

and campaigns conducted this year.
The concert will also become an
annual affair. The Committee also
plans to sell stationery to students
next year. This stationary will be
sold in the dormitories and through
the fraternity houses.

New Officers

ed its annual talent awards and
elected officers for the coming term
at its yearly banquet Friday.

Talent awards went to:

John Dunnell, best actor.

Charlie Bright, best supporting ac-
tor.

Andy Adelson, best technician.

Rene’ Reixach, the freshman
award.
The new officers for next year

are Charlie Bright, president; Dan
Friedman, seasonal stage manager;
Jim Foley, business manager; Steve
Colvin, publicity director; and Floyd
McKinnon, personnel director.

Dunnell was named best actor for
his role as Orgon in Tartuffe. A
graduating senior, he has appeared
in every Troubadour production at
Washington and Lee during his four
years here.

Bright won the best supporting ac-
tor award for his role as Damis
also in Tartuffe. He is a rising jun-
ior.

Adelson received best technician
award for his work during the year
as seasonal stagemanager. This is
the third year he has won the award.
Reixach, who won the freshman
award, appeared in all three Troub
productions this year and did back-
stage work.

Four graduating seniors received
Troubadour awards in recognition
of their contributions to the theatre
during their years at W&L. They are
Andy Leonard, George Harvey, Dun-
nell and Adelson.

Bright succeeds Dunnell as presi-
dent of the Troubadours. He has
been a member at large to the execu-
tive committee of the Troubadours,
is a member of Pi Kappa Phi and
the Glee Club. During his two years
at W&L, he has worked in some
capacity on every show. Aside from
his role in Tartuffe he was seen
this year as the judge in Inherit the
Wind and as Squatriglia in Chee-
Chee.

Friedman is also a rising junior.
Last year he won the freshman
award. He has acted as stage man-
ager for two shows, and done other
backstage and scenery work. Also he
appeared briefly in Othello last year.
He is a member of ZBT.

Publicity Chairman

Delegation chairmen will also lead
pre-convention campaigning for the
several Republican possibilities for
the nomination. The chairmen must
prepare floats to represent their
states in the parade before the con-
vention.

Big Three States

The most important positions
among the state deputations are New
York, Pennsylvania, and California,
all of which control huge blocs of
convention votes; and Arizona, Mich-
igan, and Pennsylvania, which will
nominate leading contenders for the
nomination. Since New York also
has a contender for the nomination,
the New York Chairmanship will
be doubly important.

State chairmen, said Partington,
should be residents of the states they
represent, although this is not es-
sential. They must be rising juniors,
rising seniors, or law students.

In previous Mock Convention
preparation, chairmen of the state
delegations have not been selected
until the Christmas before the con-
vention. The purpose of selecting
them now, said Partington, is to al-
low them the summer months to
lay a foundation in their states.

Summer Preparation

This foundation work will include
personal contact with their local
and state Republican leaders in or-
der to assess the amount of support
for the various candidates. It will
also entail fund-raising to support
Convention expenses. Most of the
funds which are solicited during the
summer will go for floats and simi-
lar campaign expenses.

Those chosen to be state chairmen
will be notified by mail within one
week of the close of school. A Con-
vention Brochure is being prepared
to aid them in publicizing the con-
vention over the summer, and will
reach them late in June.

Partington asked that applications
be sent to the Chairman of the Mock
Convention, Box 617, Lexington.

Letters should include the follow-
ing information about the applicant:
activities in school, resident state,

state for which the writer would
like to apply, political contacts in
that state, and summer address.

Partington requested that letters be
as concise as possible.

There will be a Chemistry Sem-
inar in Howe 401 this Friday at
5:00 p.m. The discussion will fea-
ture James Reynolds and John
Roper, who will speak on “The
Fruits of Our Labor.” The sem-

inar will be preceded by a tea at
1:30 in Howe 402.

There will be a sports bar-b-q on
Wednesday the 22 at Coach Me-
Laughlin’s farm. All monograms,
numerals and trophys will be pre-
sented at this time. The time will be
4:30 p.m., and anvone needing a ride
to the farm should inquire at Dore-
mus gymnasium.

Students can pick up their copies
of the Calyx on Thursday of this
week at the Student Union.

An Opportunity To Appreciate

The selection of the state

Mock Convention is a matter for the entire student body to
take note of. The success or failure of the 1964 Convention
hinges directly on those who fill these offices. We trust that
students who are the least bit interested will apply.
Applications are to be considered on the basis of interest,
available time, and ability to organize and get along with others.
Convention Chairman Phil Sharp stated that knowledge about

politics is not a requisite.

If it is to be successful, the Convention will demand the
full participation of the student body. Part of the responsibility
of state chairmen, it should be noted, is to enlist this participa-
tion and see that each student has his share of the work.

Traditionally, the Mock Convention is student-run and

student-financed. Although it is
sive of the college conventions,

the most authentic. Since its beginning in 1908, it has predicted
correctly eight of the nominees for the party out of office,
and was wrong in only four cases. The accuracy of these pre-
dictions has depended primarily on the state chairmen.

We are particularly grateful to the Administration for
providing us with this valuable opportunity. We students

should feel extremely obligated

heres to its original purpose, i.e., to give us as future citizens
the chance to see and experience the nation’s politics at work.

If we fail to take such an opportunity seriously, we may
be hurting the student bodies that succeed us. For it is only
through the generosity of the Administration that we continue

to have the Convention. If we

Conflicts Over Basic Rights
Evokes Remarks On Dewey

By PETE ALFORD

We all know about the right of
ownership of private property, but
are we as familiar as we should be
with the responsibilities of owner-
ship which accompany that right?

“We reserve the right to refuse
service to anyone,” states many a
sign in this country, but is that an
inalienable right?

“Why of course! A business es-
tablishment is private property and
the individual’s property is protect-
ed by the Constitution.”

“Yes, but what about the right of
every individual in this country?
What does the Constitution say about
that?”

“It protects them. That's why we
have the right to refuse service to
anyone. Don’t you see? I believe
in the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,
and the traditions of our country as
much as the next guy.”

These and related issues are being
tested in the United States and will
continue to be tested. It will prob-
ably be the paramount internal is-
sue facing our country in the next
decade. Where do you stand?

Tradition vs. Change

Philosopher John Dewey in his
work Liberalism and _ Intelligence
puts forth some ideas which are
poignantly applicable to situations
today. He contends that we live in
a world of constant change and that
this state of flux generates problems.
Our institutions, customs, and tra-
ditions of the past are in constant
conflict with new forces and stresses.

Dewey suggests that we need to

struggle for intellectual freedom.

the Virginia State Police Headquart-
ers in Richmond, a small church in
Rockbridge County and the Cerebral
Palsy Center in Richmond. His first
fresco was done in 1952 in the base-
ment of Washington and Lee’s Mc-
Cormick Library. It deals with man’s

 

adjust the old with the new. He
sees the whole of man’s history as
repetitious human adaption on a col-
lective basis to the demand of new
situations.

To a large extent man has solved
the basic problems of providing food
and shelter for himself, but there
remains the whole range of social
problems—or how to live together.

End to Mankind Seen

Dewey, who wrote this work in
1935, sees an end of mankind unless
social problems can be solved. He|
suggests that we as human beings|
must modify old habits, customs, and |
traditions to meet new situations,
remembering to avoid the danger of
foisting the old on the new, and,
just as important, not allowing the
new to erupt destructively and de-
stroy all that is good in the old.

Dewey maintains that intellegence
will effect a bridge between old tra-
ditions and new forces. It is a choice,
then, between force or intellegence,
and Dewey feels that if people are
convinced that force is the only way,
they will be cut off from the use
of intelligence. He states that the
problem of conflict is not an insur-
mountable obstacle to rational solu-
tions of social problems.

Discussion of Conflict

In his philosophy he suggests that
with the use of intellegence we can
discuss, appraise and _ adjudicate
problems which occur from con-
flicts of interest and devise solutions
in the light of greater social pur-
poses.

A Note From Friday Edition

Dear Sirs:

There have been two unfortunate
misunderstandings in recent weeks
which need to be clarified before
the school year ends. One of these
was included in an editorial which
endorsed Lamar Lamb’s proposal to
modify the permanent expulsion
penalty in our Honor System. It
was printed, at that time, that the
permanent expulsion penalty was
instituted only thirty years ago.

The following week, this statement |

was modified to read: “According to
Lamb, penalties other than the pres-
ent one were invoked as late as 1936;
...he assures us that there were
convicted honor violators who re-
ceived less than the present penalty.”
The statement in the first editorial
was false, and the statement in the
second one appears to be a moot
point among EC members. In other
words, it depends on how you in-
terpret the past EC minutes. It is
this matter of interpretation which
led to the confusion about this point.
Whatever the case may be, however,
I do not think it is relevant to the
spirit of Lamar Lamb’s proposal.

The second misunderstanding has

ham?

no relation to the one just men-
tioned. In last Friday’s paper we
mentioned that one individual de-
termined W&L’s stand on NSA
affiliation. This was our understand-
ing at the time. It has been pointed
out, though, that the EC did vote
unanimously on this measure. The
point of what was said in our reply
to Mr. Gilmore should remain ob-
vious nevertheless.

DREW BAUR

Student Wants To End
Foreign Exchange Program

Dear Sir:

I would like to recommend to the
faculty and student body that the
foreign exchange program as it is
at this school be dropped.

There are many individuals that
have received a great deal of bene-
fit from the exchange program this
year, but they are few. More im-
portant, the foreign students them-
selves have, by their own admission,
received nothing but a negative im-
pression of America and of Wash-
ington and Lee during their stay
here. This need not be; the exchange
program works well in the majority
of schools across the country.

The failure of the program this
year is due to W&L itself. With-
out making value judgments about
our fraternity system, we can still
see that it prevents foreign stu-
dents from making friends. By the
second week here, most students
know the people that will be their
close friends for the next four
years; and to introduce a person
into their world as a sophomore,
especially one that is foreign to
their particular folkways, will have
predictable results. I am as guilty
of this as anyone else.

Two solutions present themselves:
either change the school or drop the
program. The first is hopeless; and
the second, though unfortunate, is
necessary if we are to avoid a tre-
mendous waste of money, hope, and
time that occurred this year from
happening again.

Dr. Junkin’s most recent fresco is
in the Children’s Chapel of Lex-
ington’s R. E. Lee Memorial Episco-
pal Church of which he is a mem-
ber. He began work on the design
and preliminary sketches of the new
fresco during the first semester of
the current academic year and com-
pleted the 19-panel mural a little
less than a month ago.

The Episcopal church fresco—

able by children. On the left side of

 

Dr. Junkin Working on Fresco for Episcopal Church

keyed to a center painting of the
Madonna and Christ Child—is done
in what Dr. Junkin describes as “an
almost primitive style.” The 18 side
panels depict famous Biblical scenes
that are considered easily recogniz-

the center portrait are nine scenes
from the Old Testament and the
right side features nine stories from
the New Testament.

A Local Master Of Fresco- Painting
Applies Skills Of Artist And Plasterer

Before the actual plastering was
done in the Children’s Chapel, Dr.
Junkin drew the full freseo on
brown paper mounted on the wall
in his duPont Hall Studio on the
Washington and Lee campus. He in-
cluded the finest detail and coloring
in his preliminary painting.

Scaffold building, the hauling of
plaster, marble sand and water plus
the necessary tools followed for the
three months after the Washington
and Lee professor finished the first
drawing. Prof. Junkin turned to the
actual fresco painting in mid-Feb-
ruary, and, then, did it only in his
spare time.

Alter in Future Plans

In the way of finishing touches
for the tiny chapel, Dr. Junkin plans
to make a small altar, hang drapes
and refinish the pews in the room.
He already has rigged special light-

ing to accent the fresco.

A native of Chunju, Korea, where
his parents were missionaries, Dr.
Junkin first beeame interested in
fresco painting in the early 1950's.
Washington and Lee awarded him
a Glenn grant-in-aid in 1952 for
a summer’s study of the fresco pro-
cess and its history in Mexico. His
1952 visit resulted in the frescos in
the University library, in the hos-
pital in Lexington and in the State
Police building. Dr. Junkin and his
family returned to Mexico again in
the summer of 1950 so he could study
fresco painting further.

Summer Trip to Greece
This summer, he plans to journey
to Greece to study Byzantine frescos

in some of the Greek Orthodox
chruches.
Dr. Junkin, a 1927 graduate of

Washington and Lee, established the
University’s fine arts department
when he returned to Lexington in
1949. He came back to Alma Mater

Discussion of integration is becom-
ing an increasingly popular topic
among certain ele-
ments on_ the
Washington and
Lee campus. The
theme of discus-
sion centers on the
question of inte-
gration of W&L
itself, and whether
this is morally
right or wrong,
Christian or non-
Christian. But this
is not the real is-
sue. The real issue is whether we, as
American citizens, have the right to
choose ‘the type of people with whom
we wish to associate.

I do not deny anyone an educa-
tion because of his race, color or
creed. There are many educational
institutions in our country with bi-
racial student bodies, as well as
those that are all-Negre or all-
white. I feel that every qualified

he is congenial.
Differences Stressed

ings, but he made us different in
color, personality, and ability. If
he had meant for us to all be alike,
he would have made us so; but for-
tunately the earth is not populated
with stereotypes. It is my observa-
tion that people separate according
to their differences. It is a natural
thing.

People with different ideas and de-
sires would rather associate with
those similarly oriented. It is the
same with people of different races.
Most of them would rather be
with their own kind. The important
thing is that people have a right
to choose, and it is unfair to force
them into one group when they
would rather be in another.

Intergration at W&L

It is in this light that I view the
question of integration at W&L. I
am not questioning whether inte-
gration is right or inevitable. I do
know that at the present time, peo-
ple have a right to choose the envir-
onment and the type of students with
which they wish to study. Wash-
ington and Lee is a private institu-
tion and as such it has a right to
choose the people who will make
up its student body. When students

come to W&L, they know that it

young person should be offered the! &

 

with the type of people with whom |

The Creator made us human be-| ,

| is a university which has chosen to

educate an all-white student body.
A student who feels more congenial
with Negroes should not come to
W&L, but rather attend an inte-
grated school, or try to get in an
all-Negro school. But I contend that
all-Negro schools as well as all-
White schools such as W&L, have
a right to choose their student bodies.

If a student realizes after coming
to W&L that he would be happier in
an integrated school, it is not his
place to ask the school to change
for him; it is his place to do the
changing.

 

Freedom Of Association Stands
As Reason For Segregation Here

This is not a monetary question.
Most certainly Washington and Lee
loses contributions to its endowment
because some individuals or organ-
izations choose to donate to an in-
tegrated school. But on the other
hand it gains from others who wish
to contribute to a segregated school.
This is not a question of whether
we deny Negroes a right to an edu-
cation. Surely we do not. The ques-
tion is one of right of association
and those who would forbid us this
right, forbid at the same time one
of the basic rights of freedom of
the American people.

_ Negro entertain-
; ers. That column
was provoked by
the quality of
some of what was
foisted as “en-
tertainment” here
during Springs Weekend and was not
meant to refer to any particular
existing situation.

Since the publication of that col-
umn, I have learned that James
Baldwin, the noted Negro writer,
had been asked to speak on this
campus under the sponsorship of the
English Department and the Liberty
Hall Society. Though this action
was taken some months ago, I
learned of it only after my column
had been printed.

   

Kinsey

The Faculty Lecture Committee,
with two members of the student
body present, voted unanimously
to ask Mr. Baldwin to speak. The
Committee action is standard pro-
cedure, as the Committee has to
approve the disbursement of funds
for the payment of speakers. The
two students present were the
president of the student body at
the time (he meets with the Com-
mittee on important matters) and

 

the president of the Liberty Hall
Society.

Distinguished Negro Writer
Invited to Speak on Campus

Upon approval of the request for
funds with which to pay Mr. Bald-
win, a letter was sent to him and
he was asked to speak. A short
time later, Dr. Duvall, head of the
English Department received a letter
from Baldwin’s agent, stating that
Baldwin was in Europe at the time
and that he was booked for a serie:
of speaking engagements on_ the
West Coast as soon as he got back
The agent went on to say _ tha’
Baldwin had plans to begin work 01
a play as soon as he arrived bach
in New York, and that it would br
a good while before he would b
free to speak anywhere. Baldwit
he said, already had to decline |
good number of offers to speak else
where. The agent also stated tha
Baldwin was seeking a little res
after his tiring round of travel ani
speeches of the last few months.

The fact that is significant and
praiseworthy is that Baldwin was
asked to speak here because he
is a distinguished Negro write:
(note light face), and because it
was felt that he had something tq
offer to this student body. These
two criterion—distinetion in one’:
field and something worthwhile t
offer—properly applied, should b«
the basis of judging everyone whx«
appears on this campus, regard.
less of whether what he is offering
is intellectual enlightenment o
entertainment, regardless of races
or creed.

(Baldwin’s books are: Ge Tell
on the Mountain, 1953; Netes of
Native Son, 1955; Giovanni‘s Room
1956; Nobody Knows My Name, 196

 

Another Country, 1962.)

In Final Game

By DOUG MORRISON

The lacrosse team closed out its
season on Saturday with a 13-5
loss in a hard fought game against
the nationally ranked Cavaliers of
Virginia. The spectators at Char-
lottesville saw a closely contested
game for the first period and a half
until Virginia captain Landon Huff
scored his only goal of the day to
help put the Cavaliers out of reach.
The second and third periods were
the decisive ones for Virginia with
four goals being scored in each.

Initial Score

The first score of the day came
with less than a minute gone in the
first period on a goal by Virginia
attackman Jack Davies. After that
the game settled into an even battle
between the two teams, until midway
in the same period Virginia got two

quick goals. The W&L team then An exciting moment in one of the General’s lacrosse games this year.

Last week the track team elected
next year’s tri-captains. They are
Skip Essex, John Pearson, and Rob-
in Kell. All three are Dean’s List
scholars and are stalwarts of the

tional and Olympic champions. Skip picked up but could not score until

has placed second in the state in the
440 twice and the half mile twice. His
time for the quarter is 49.2 seconds,
and his time for the 880 is one min- |

than a minute to go in the period on

John Pearson, a member of Delta
Tau Delta, specializes in hurdles. He
holds the school record for the 330
intermediate hurdles with a time of
39.8 seconds. He placed third in
the CAC meet in the high hurdles
this year, running a time of 158
seconds, his best time. Last year he
was one of four sprinters who es-
tablished a meet record for the sprint
medley relay at the Davidson Re-
lays. This record still remains un-
broken. John is a member of the
Varsity Club.

Rebin Kell, ace General field
man, became a state champion this
spring when he won the triple
jump at the state meet at William
and Mary with a leap of 43 feet and
9 inches. He set a CAC record in
this event also. He holds two school
records, the high jump at 6 feet, 1%4
inches, and the triple jump at 45
feet 4 inches.

Jim DeYoung has been elected
captain of next year’s varsity team.
This past season he led the team
to a 5-3 record, playing in the
number one position. He also teamed
with Randy Jones at the number one
doubles to make the varsity’s most
effective doubles team and the two
together comprised an outstanding
record in outside competition.
