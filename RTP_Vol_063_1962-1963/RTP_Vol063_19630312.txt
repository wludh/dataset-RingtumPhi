Closes Season
With Laurels

The debate season is nearing an
end. Bill Noell and Al Eckes left
yesterday for a debate at King’s
College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsyl-
vania, which is the qualifying round
for the National Debate Tourna-

| ment. The only remaining debates

are tentative.

As the schedule stands, W&L will
be in a novice tournament at

Mr. William Wells Chaffin, debate
coach, is pleased with W&L’'s ac-
complishments in debate this year.
Commenting on the record so far he
said, “It’s our best in four years,
but the record doesn’t mean much.”
Mr. Chaffin was referring to the fact
that he has used twenty different
debaters in intercollegiate tourna-
ments. To quote the won-lost rec-
ord compiled by this group, he said,

Next Week By Various Groups

James Boatwright, Instructor of
English, will present a _ lecture!
next Tuesday night for the Wash- |
ington and Lee Literary Society. |
To be held in the Student Union |
at 7:30 p.m., the talk will be open|
to the public.

The subject of Mr. Boatright’s
lecture will be a critical analysis
of John Updike’s Rabbit, Run,
which was published to unpreci-
dented acclaim by Knopf in 1960.
Updike had been known previous-
ly for his stories in the New
Yorker and he had been praised
for his lyrical style. It was not
until Rabbit, however, that he be-
came well-known. It was his sec-
ond novel; he has followed it with
a third since then, Centaur.

The protagonist of Rabbit, Run is
Rabbit Angstrom, a confused dream-
er who deserts his wife on impulse
and lives with a prostitute. He is
unable to come to a decision about
anything, and at the end of the
book, as at the first, he is still run-
ning. The other characters are pre-
sented with the same home-grown
deterministic outlook. Everything
about the book is startlingly con-
temporary; it is set in a small urban
section of southern Pennsylvania in
the spring of 1959.

The kind of American life that
Rabbit is pictured as running away
from is frightening—vulgar, dead-
ly in its conformity, dull and un-
speakably tasteless. He per-
son caught in the trap of the
American Dream and his lack of

any criterion allows him to es-
cape—but to what? He doesn't
know. His own dreams seem to

be made up of adolescent nostal-
gia for his athletic triumphs and
lust. This is a grotesque allegory
of our ewn lives, with our myth
of happiness and success, our dan-
gerous innocence and _ crippling
antagonism between value and

imminent. Updike treads the line
between bitterness and optimism,
and the result is well worth reading.

The title for Mr. Boatwright’s lec-
ture will be announced next week.

Hailed as one of the truly great
contemporary artists in the folk-
singing and blues field, Odetta has
appeared in all the top night clubs
in America that cater to her par-
ticular idiom. Warmly received all
across the country from the “Hun-
gryi” in San Fransico to the “Blue
Angel” in New York, Odetta’s talent
is no less enthusiastically recognized
in the capitals of Western Europe.

Odetta’s warm vibrant contralto
voice, her intensely individual style,
and her emotionally personal idiom
has made her an increasingly popular
performer. She has recorded albums
for Tradition, Vanguard and River-
side, and is presently appearing un-
der the RCA label. Her numerous
television appearances and annual
college concert tours denote a rapid-
ly expanding professional life.

Born in Birmingham, Odetta mov-
ed te Los Angeles at an early age.
It was during her secondary edu-
cation in the California public
schools that she began taking voice
lessons. Partially assisted by a pa-
tron who recognized Odetta’s natur-
al talent, she worked as a maid for
several years after graduation in
order to help finance her music edu-
cation. It was during this period
that she was first exposed to the
folk music which was later to be-
come her particular idiom. A self-
taught guitarist in these years, she
quickly gained proficiency in that
instrument which allows her to
create “a driving rhythm that car-
ries its own strong emotional thrust.”

To Odetta, the beauty and rich-
nes of folk music brings a sense of
freedom and range of expression
that reveals her as an interpretive
artist of rare gift. Just as significant
to her, perhaps, is the blues field.
Her recent evolution into this mu-
sical idiom promises to prove the
ultimate expression of her artistry—
demanding as it does both freedom
of tempo and emotional pitch.

When asked for comment, Dance
Board President Frank Young noted
his pleasure at the signing of Odet-
ta for the Friday night concert. He
said, “Odetta together with the
Journeymen, who will appear at
the same concert, should provide the
finest folk-music program ever pre-
sented by the Dance Board.”

Odetta will begin her perform-
ance at 8 p.m. and will precede the
Journeymen.,

Brief Bikinis Return To Ancient Glory? |

Cause of long sermons and short jail sentences, the
bathing suit has had as stormy a history as any sea-
borne hurricane.

Think the Bikini is a modern wrinkle? Wall fres-
coes in the ruins of Pompeii show a bathing beauty,
circa 79 A.D., wearing a drastically abbreviated two-
piece swimming costume.

Proper, right-thinking Romans were shocked—and
harked back to the days, as recently as Julius Caesar’s
reign, when swimmers did not sport such immodest
outfits. In fact, they wore no swimsuits at all—men
and women swam in separate areas.

As late as 1800, swimmers were segregated by
sex and faced the waves in their birthday suits.
In those days, ocean swimming was regarded pri-
marily as a health measure, like drinking from
mineral springs.

When people finally recognized the bracing effects
of coed swimming, men challenged the surf in dress-
ing gowns—and ladies in a flannel cloak tied at the
neck.

By 1850, extreme modesty had put a damper on all
this. Men got off relatively lightly, however, in stripped
woolen trousers that reached to mid-calf and high-
necked T-shirts that dropped to the knees.

But the lovelies they ogled were screened
from collarbone to instep by blouse, skirt, panta-
loons and stockings—about 19 yards and 30
wet pounds of modesty.

Probably few ventured into the water at all; here,
undoubtedly, began the tradition of the decorative
bathing beauty who never gets her suit damp. And
just in ease these overdressed damsels were foolhardy
enough to brave the water, their bathing costumes
were equipped with rustproof corsets.

Then came the year of the revolution: 1909. Annette
Kellerman, Australian swimming star, appeared on
the beaches in a figure-fitting jersey suit with sleeves
shortened almost to her shoulders and trousers end-
ing two inches above her knees. “I want to swim,”
she said.

She was arrested in Boston—but she had begun
a fashion trend to swimsuits worthy of the name.

The rule of law was applied—literally. Of-
ficial 1917 beach regulations barred any suit that
exposed a male or female chest “lower than a
line drawn on a level with the ar mpits. ” Bathing
skirts and knickers could not t rise more than

four inches above the knee. In 1920, police pa-
trolled the beaches with yardsticks!

But time and tide were waiting for no man—or
woman, In 1933 the maillot, a one-piece job resembling
a dancer's leotard, arrived from France—and caused
a near-riot when viewed by a gaping crowd in a New
York department store window.

Soon after, the new wave of the future arrived from
the continent. It was the two-piece suit, nothing
more—and often considerably less—than the maillot
chopped in half. Detachable-top suits for men allowed
them to bare their manly chests if they so desired—
and many of them did. Pastors inveighed against the
sinful new fashions. Some of our best-formed citizens
landed in jail.

By 1935, the long arm of the law had stuck its
hand into its pocket in a gesture of surrender. But the
struggle had not yet reached a fitting conclusion.

In an effort to make the swimsuits shape up,
new materials were tried. All-rubber suits were
worn for a time in the ‘30's, but didn’t last long—
they were clammy when wet, and embarrassing-
ly apt to suddenly rip. The elasticized suit was
the tidal wave that hit the beaches in the “40's.

 

In the postwar era, knit suits have had a strong
upsurge of popularity—and for good reason. The old
flattery is still there, raised to a higher power by |
new fibers.

Bathing beaches in these Soaring Sixties are
definitely getting more and more colorful too, with
the flocks of bathing beauties resembling birds of

paradise.

There is also more leeway in today’s suit shape;
the now perennial fitted suit must share honors with
the shift effect and other softly draped shapes that
might have looked kind of baggy before science learned
to spin yarns.

Two-piece styles have gained favor in recent
years after a long period out of the swim, but
the itsy-bitsey-teenie-weenie Bikini — yellow
polka dot or otherwise—flourishes largely (or
is that the wrong word) on foreign shores.

What happens to the bathing suit when it can’t
get smaller—and isn’t likely to become bigger?

It holds fast, in a state of delicious tension, to its
position as one of history’s more delightful strokes of
genius.

 

 

BATHING BEAUTIES display their natural assets in new bathing suits designed to brighten

the coming spring scene.

 

 

“Sees Set Cocktail Pte
An Issue For Spring Elections

A remark in last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi has aroused in-
quiries from a number of students. An announcement stated
that the Executive Committee had turned down last week’s
proposal to let the classes rather than the individual fraterni-
ties pay for the Dance Set cocktail parties. It was added that
“the EC felt that this change should be effected in some other

way than in regular student body elections.”

This remark was unfortunately misleading. The reason
that the proposal was turned down, according to Lanny Butler,
secretary of the student body, was that, since the proposal did
not involve a constitutional change, it did not fall under EC
priority. The Committee was in a position only to endorse the
spirit of the proposal and allow the change to come about
through the proper channels. The EC by no means discourages
this issue from being taken up in the coming student body

elections.

That the change should be made is obvious. The present
system of Dance Set cocktail parties is strikingly unfair and
irrational. The expenses of sponsoring an “open house”
for the whole university has become enormous. This has been
particularly true in recent years when the cost of cocktail
parties has skyrocketed completely out of proportion. At pres-
ent, it is sheer absurdity to throw the entire financial burden of

such an extravaganza on a single fraternity.

The feasible way in which the change can be effected is
through the upcoming spring elections. By all means, this
issue should become a major platform plank for the candidates
of both parties. Above all, the change must be made this
spring;the present system is too obsolete to survive another

year.

By the

HON. SAMUEL P. PEGGENGILL
Former Congressman from Indiana

The general acceptance of today’s
slogan that nine or even five men,
neither elected nor removable by
the people, can rewrite the Constitu-
tion as they see fit, and that it then
becomes everyone’s duty to accept
their views as “law,” is a long stride
toward Bonapartism in this coun-
try.

The saying that “The Constitution
is what the Supreme Court says it
is,’ is attributed to Charles Evans
Hughes. But I have a letter from a
former justice of the Supreme Court
who says that Hughes told him that
he was speaking in a jocular mood,
and had always regretted his remark.

A decision by the United States
Supreme Court on a Constitution-
al question, is not only not the
“supreme law of the land”; it is
not any kind of law!

This is because a court has no
authority to make law, or amend the
Constitution. Its judgment, whether
right or wrong, is, of course, bind-
ing on the litigants in the case, un-
less reversed on appeal.

party

But it is not binding on other
persons. As Chief Justice Harlan
F. Stone said in 1942, a court’s
judgment “is binding only on the
parties to the particular proceed-
ings.’ (Columbia Broadcasting
Company vs. United States, 316
U.S. 407). This statement by the
Chief Justice should dispose the
question, especially as there was
no dissent to it.

 

It is true, of course, that other
persons—judges, public officials or

private individuals—may agree that
the reasons given by a court for its
decision are sound and right and

decide to follow them in_ similar
situations.
But they may not agree, and

that is their right. Why? Because a
court of judgment is not law. No
court has the authority to make
law.

This point is much more import-

ant than the Brown case itself, re-
speeting negro children in our
schools no matter which way that
ease could have been decided.

Law can be laid down only by
those who have the authority to
make law. In our country, that
authority is given only to legisla-
tors, elected by the people, and re-
movable by the people. Or it is
in the People themselves in adopt-
ing, or amending their Constitu-
tion, federal or state. There let
it remain!

 

|
|

 

The Constitution says how it can
be amended—only by the People,
in the manner prescribed. No court
is mentioned.

Second, the Constitution says that
all legislative or lawmaking powers
of the Federal government are vested
in Congress. It does not make the
Supreme Court a constitutional con-
vention. As all federal legislative
power is vested in Congress, none
is vested in the Supreme Court!

Third, the Constitution says that
“this Constitution and the laws of
the United States which shall be
made (by Congress) in pursuance
thereof (plus treaties) shall be the
supreme law of the land” and all
“judicial officers, both of the United
States and of the several States,
shall be bound by oath or affirma-
tion to support this Constitution.”

All judges take this oath. It is

a contradiction in terms to argue

that a judge can lawfully change

what he has taken an oath to
support,

This was universally accepted for
a century and a half until recently.
Chief Justice Marshall said in 1824,
“Judicial power, as contradistin-
guished from the power of law, has
NO EXISTENCE. Courts are the
mere instruments of the law and can
WILL nothing.” They can decide
cases, rightly or wrongly, and the}
parties to the case are bound by
their judgments. But no one else!
If their decisions were to bind other
persons, then such persons would be
ruled against without being heard,
without “their day in court.” This
would violate all concepts of justice
and law.

Judges can say what they think
is the law, or what they think the
constitution means, and apply that
to the decision of the case before
them. They can overrule, or re-
fuse to follow what they or other
judges have previously thought
was the law. But they cannot make
laws, or rewrite the Constitution.
A court decision is an opinion!

On the other hand, Congress, in
whom is vested all legislative powers
of the Federal government, can de-
cide what they think should be the
law, and by a majority vote, what
they think becomes law, assuming
that it is constitutional.

~ what a court thinks should be
the law, does not become law be-
cause they think it should.

If that were not true, the Su-
preme Court could not overrule its
own previous interpretation of the
Constitution as it has done time
and time again. In deciding the

did in fact overrule its own pre-
vious decisions, and the settled law
of the nation for ninety years.

But if these PREVIOUS deci-
sions were “the supreme law of
the land” which the judges had
sworn to uphold, how could they
reverse such decisions without
violating their oath?

That the Supreme Court has at
times asted as a super-legislature has
been many times stated by Supreme
Court judges themselves in dissent-
ing opinions. Conferences of the
Chief Justices and Attorneys- Gen-
eral of the States have also charged
the Supreme Court with violating
the Constitution.

Those who are making a fetish
remember that the opponents of
slavery were once shouted down by
of the segregation decision should

In the interest of stability and un-

desirable that lower federal and
state courts should abide by a de-
cision of the U.S. Supreme Court,
even if they think it is wrong. But
they do so, not because the Con-

errors being made and we feel that,
though the students and faculty
should know the rules and inter-

measures that will inform or re-

Cocktail Parties Proposal

We read in the last Ring-tum Phi
that the Executive Committee has
turned down the proposal that the
classes rather than individual fra-
ternities pay for the Dance Set
cocktail parties. The piece in the
paper went on to say that the E.C.
favored the “spirit of the petition,
but did not it it
would have placed the proposal on
the spring election ballot.” The E.C.
felt, so the article says, that the
change should be effected in some
other way than in the student body
elections in May. (See today’s Edi-
torial—ed.)

We can’t think of a better way for
the students to vote on a proposal
that affects them all than at spring

great majority of the student body
votes, a larger majority, we feel,
than would turn out if this pro-
posal were voted on separately.
Left Confused

This brings us, one way or an-

other, to a more significant issue.

Seandal

None of us can remember the
honor system scandal which caused
a substantial number of football
players to leave school in 1952. The
suspension of the students forced
the administration to no _ longer
grant athletic scholarships. The re-
mainder of the athletes on scholar-
ships were permitted to finish their
stay at W&L without the loss of
their professional standing.

The 1950 football season dawned
as the most promising of any year
experienced by the Generals. Losing
only to Virginia and the Volunteers
of the University of Tennessee, this
powerhouse squad crushed Furman,
West Virginia, The Citadel, David-
son,, and Virginia Tech, just to
name the most prominent o fthe op-
position that year. With an 8-2 sea-
son record the Generals faced a
strong Wyoming team in the Gator
Bowl! New Year’s day to the thund-
ering roar of more than 30,000 fans.
The loss of Walt Michaels, W&L’s
leading rusher, due to an injury,
didn’t help the Generals’ chances,
but All-State quarterback Gil Bo-
cetti sought to meet Wyoming’s All-
American tailback Eddie Talboom
on equal ground. But there was no
stopping the Wyoming passer and
Bosetti was able to score only once

With the seandal in 1953 the
payed athlete was ushered out
for good and it was up to men

like Boyd Williams and later Lee
McLaughlin to attempt and bring
back at least part of the former
fame received in the 1950 season.
The fall of 1954 marked the be-
ginning of these attempts as the
Generals’ fielded only a Junior
Varsity team playing afar from
satisfactory schedule. The results
were promising, however, as Boyd
Williams coached his team to a
2-1-1 season.

In the next few years the Gen-
erals attempted to remain in the
field against the powers they had
formerly been able to beat resound-
ingly. The result was only discour-
agement and many, many losses. But
in 1959 the story began to change.
Schools on our own level became
more and more prominent on the
W&L schedule and we began win-
ning. Coach Lee McLaughlin’s re-
building program began paying off.
That year Centre College fell in the
opener and Dickinson limped off,
routed by a 42-14 score that had
the sportswriters turning _ their
heads. The year ended with the
Generals still on the wrong end of
the season record, 3-4-1, but with
more hope tha never before for
better things to come.

The 1960 season bore these hopes
out. The Generals ,finished their first
undefeated season since 1914, win-

Promising Season
For Tennis Squad

The outlook for this year’s varsity
tennis team is quite promising main-
ly because six of last year’s seven
lettermen are returning.

Bad Weather

Thus far Coach Washburn has
been hindered extensively by the
elements. The squad has been unable
to get to play on courts due to
bad weather and slowness in the
preparation of the courts, but Wash-
burn has been getting the team in
shape with workouts in the gym.

Captain John Baker will lead
the squad again this season to
what should be a highly success-
ful campaign.

The team will rely heavily on the
strong playing of Jim DeYoung
and Randy Jones who held up very
well for the Generals last season.

 

Coach Washburn says that there
are several freshmen who might be
of help to the team, but he is un-
sure since he has not had adequate
chance to watch them in action.

First Match
The team’s first match is against

Colgate on March 26. Colgate,

which has one of the best teams

among northern schools, should
give the Generals a tough open-
ing match.

The team’s schedule also includes
the University of Virginia, a strong
team which the Generals upset last
season, Old Dominion, Hampden-
Sydney, Georgetown, Richmond,
George Washington and Lynchburg.

The season will conclude with the
CAC tournament which will be held
here May 10-11.

stitution says they must, for it does
not, but for the practical reason
that if they do not abide by it, they
will be reversed on appeal.

It is also true that a court may
participate in the lawmaking pro-
cess by giving reasons for its de-
cision which seems so convincing
that they are gradually accepted
BY THE PEOPLE as good law. This
is how the common law of England

developed.
The political shibboleth that
“the Constitution is what the

.

judges say it is,” no matter what,
is so destructive of constitutional
principles, that every patriotic
American should condemn it.

For there is a rapidly growing
concentration of governmental, eco-
nomic and financial power in Wash-
ington, and particularly in the Chief
Executive, who appoints all Federal
judges.

If this trend is not soon reversed,
then the statement by a high official

that “the Constitution was written
for an entirely different period
in our nation’s history” may be-

come the epitaph of American lib-
erty.
