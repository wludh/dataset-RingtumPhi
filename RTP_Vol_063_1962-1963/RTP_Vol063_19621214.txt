Washburn
Opens Fund
Campaign

By SHANNON JUNG

The Annual Alumni Fund drive
has just been kicked off by the
Alumni Association, Alumni Secre-
tary W. C. Washburn announced
yesterday.

One vital necessity for the success
of the Fund Drive this year is get-
ting more and more alumni to par-
ticipate as contributors. The Fund
Council has set its sights high by
anticipating 100 per cent participa-
tion from the University’s 11,000
alumni.

The class agencies in various cities
haven't begun work yet, as the Cam-
paign gets underway in reality at
the beginning of the new year. The
alumni office is now busy preparing
letters for these class agents.

In connection with the fund drive,
the Alumni Association intends to
use desk pieces made of nails from
Lee Chapel embedded in clear plas-
tic.

Lee Chapel Nails

In restoring the Chapel, one step
taken to insure its permanence in-
volved replacing the wooden beams
and trusses of the roof with steel.
Many of the spikes and nails used
in the original construction are
unsuitable for re-use, and a large
number of these historical items
have been collected and saved.

Recognizing that many persons
would like to have a souvenir nail
from historic Lee Chapel, the Uni-
versity gave the Alumni Associa-
tion the prerogative of using the
nails. Some sort of co-ordination
with the Alumni Fund was a possi-
bility.

As the W&L Alumni Magazine
states, “In examining the Lee Chapel
nails, it is easy to draw an analogy
between the sturdy iron pegs which
helped support and continue to sup-
port Lee Chapel and the solid, de-
pendable and loyal alumni whose
annual contributions to the Alumni
Fund support the University in such
an important way.”

“Not for Promotion”

“Not at all a commercial enter-
prise”; Washburn stated, “there will
probably be enough nails for those
alumni who show interest in the
project by promoting the Campaign.”
There will obviously not be enough
nails for each alumnus to have
one; therefore, their distribution will
probably be on a first-come, first-
serve basis.

The criteria for distribution will
be a matter for decision at the next
Alumni Fund Council meeting. It
seems likely that the nails can play
an important part in furthering the
attainment of the objectives of the
Fund Campaign.

Plans for the distribution of the
desk pieces, as paper weights, from
the Lee Chapel nails are still in the
formative stage, although they are
an integral part in the Alumni Fund
Campaign of '62-’63.

Best Wishes
From Hairy
On Christmas

An as yet unidentified beast is
moving its slow thighs toward the
cradle to be born. When it is, it
will take the form of the 1963
Southern Collegian, Fancy Dress
version.

At the present time, Hairy is
preparing to put his flies into harness
and deliver a few Christmas goodies
to deserving Collegian staff mem-
bers—a bottle of Jack Daniels here,
Old Taylor there.

In reality, the entire Collegian
staff joins with the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi staff members (see edi-
torial, page 2) in wishing the stu-
dents and faculty of Washington
and Lee University a happy holiday
and a very hairy Christmas.

Moot Court Team Reaches Finals

By LARRY MEEKS

William H. Clark, Jr., Richard L.
Rose, and Donald H. Partington,
W&L law students, left yesterday
to participate in the National Moot
Court competition in New York City.
Approximately twenty teams, repre-
senting fifteen regions across the
nation will participate in this an-
nual competition.

W&L’s first competition will be
tonight against SMU with Clark
and Rose acting as co-captains. This

Two national awards are given, the
first, the John C. Knox Award be-
ing given to the winner of the na-
tional competition. The team pre-
senting the best prepared brief of
the case receives the Harrison Tweed

‘NEWS BRIEFS

IFC Contributes To Rockbridge Christmas Basket Fund

Over $450 has been donated to the Rockbridge Christmas Basket Fund
to date by the fraternities through the IFC. Four fraternities have not
yet turned in checks for the annual charity drive.

This contribution combined with others from the community will be
used to provide over 350 families with Christmas baskets and toys. The
UCA also participates in this program by taking up a collection for it at
their annual Candlelight Service which was held this past Sunday in
R. E. Lee Memorial Church.

 

Blood Donation Requires Parental Consent

In last night’s IFC meeting, Blood Drive Chairman Freddy Cooper
distributed letters to the representatives of each house. Attached to each
letter is a card to be signed by parents of sons under twenty-one giving
their consent for their sons to donate blood in the annual Blood Drive.

Lack of parental consent has been one of the major problems in the
Blood Dive, but this should be solved by the cards and postage-paid
envelopes attached to each letter.

Alumni Set $115,000 Goal For Fund Drive

The goal of this year’s Alumni Association Fund Drive is $115,000, it
was announced today by W&L Information Services. The amount is $15,-
000 higher than the mark sought last year. Donald M. Fergusson, a 1951
graduate who lives in Richmond, is chairman of the 1962-63 Alumni Fund
Council, a six-man group charged with directing the annual drive for the
Alumni Association.

Seminar In Literature To Feature Reynolds Price

The 43rd program in Washington and Lee’s Seminars in Literature
series will be presented January 11 when Reynolds Price, a young novel-
ist and member of the Duke University faculty, speaks here. A former
Rhodes Scholar, Price is the author of A Long and Happy Life, which has
been nominated for the 1962 National Book Award and is the first entire
novel to be printed in one issue of Harper’s Magazine.

More Fancy Dress Costumes Coming After Christmas
A new supply of Fancy Dress costumes will be available after Christmas
at a date to be announced later in the Ring-tum Phi, Dance Board Vice
President Ed Croft said today. Due to a record demand for costumes
this year, the FD costume stock is presently exhausted.
The Oak Hill Cap and Gown Company of Roanoke is getting the new
costumes, according to Croft.

Candlelight Service Given New Format This Year
The University Christian Association Candlelight Service was held last
Sunday evening and was attended by a capacity audience again this year.
Rather than familiar carols and sermons, the program consisted of nine
scripture readings and old carols, most traditional English hymns. The
Glee Club and the John A. Graham Choir led the music.
The form of the service is known as the Festival of Nine Lessons and
Carols, and is drawn from ancient sources. It was given its present form
in 1918 at King’s College, Cambridge, where it is annually presented.

Red, White, Blue Banners Carry A Message

The pennons flying daily on the grass in front of the library are placed |

out by the ROTC department to inform cadets of instructions concerning
drill assignments.

The red guidon signifies that cadets will not wear overcoats with their
uniforms; the blue that there will be no Corps Day; and the white that
drill will be held in the gym.

W&L has the respondent’s side
and SMU the petitioner’s side, and
the case concerns the right of the
accused to have legal counsel in the
pre-trial hearing as well as in court.

W&L’s representatives to the reg-
ional Moot Court are chosen each
spring in the Burks Competition.
Twenty-four students entered last
year’s contest.

For the past two years Clark has
won the Burks Medal, the award for
the outstanding speaker in the Burks
Competition, and he tied with Terry
Cooper of U. Va. for the best single
speaker of the regional competition
held earlier this year in Richmond.
Clark is a senior law student, an
ODK, and his legal
Phi Delta Phi.

Rose is the only member of the
team that did not do his undergradu-
ate work at W&L. He is a gradu-
ate of Cornell, an ODK, a member of
Phi Delta Phi, and is the senior law
class representative to the Execu-
tive Committee.

Partington is an intermediate law
student, an ODK, and a member of
Phi Alpha Delta.

The regional judging is run slight-
ly different to the national in that

there is no separate judging for
briefs and presentation. A_ single
award is made for the team that

made the best showing in both.

In the regional competition W&L
defeated both Duke and South Car-
olina, but lost to U. Va. in the final
round. They will however, start on
“equal footing’ in the New Yor
competition.

resolution that the free nations of the world should establish
c ——* an economic community, were given

the win over the heavily-favored
first string pair by Mr. John Gunn
of the Commerce School. He judged
that Noell and Eckes had piled up
more speaking points, as expected,
but that Norton and Boardman had
won the debate on its technical is-
sues.

The match, held before a number
of faculty members and _ students,
was a warm up for the Atlantic
Coast Conference Championship
Tournament which the team will
enter immediately after the Christ-
mas holidays.

The loss was particularly ironic
for Noell and Eckes because their
opponents were presenting a case
which had been prepared by Eckes.
Mr. Gunn said, in announcing the
decision following the debate, that
Eckes had written a case too strong
for him to crack. He commented that
the level of “technical competence”
was the highest he had ever seen in
a college debate.

Boardman opened the debate by
presenting two needs for the estab-
lishment of the community. He
pointed out the need for unity
against communism, and the need
for economic stability. If these two
needs could be solved, he said, the
communist threat could be halted,
and the underdeveloped nations of
the world would be able to build
up to higher economic levels.

Eckes was the first negative speak-
er, and began his attack by chal-
lenging definitions and attempting
to prove that an economic commun-
ity could not solve the need for
unity and stability. He also argued
that underdeveloped countries would
find it financially impossible to join
an economic community because of
the power of the more advanced
nations.

The second affirmative speaker,
Norton, presented a plan which was,
in essence, that of a customs union.
His plan called for a council in
which all nations would be repre-
sented on the basis of economic
strength. The main provisions were
the elimination of internal tariffs
and the establishment of a common
external tariff.

Noell, the last speaker, contended
that there is no reason to believe
that nations on the borderline be-
tween the free and communist
worlds would join the union. He
argued that the plan’s disadvantages
would outweigh its advantages, and
that the present facilities are cap-
able of solving economic problems
in time.

A Christmas Comment

In these sophisticated days, when the tendency is to con-
fuse Santa Claus with Christ, and to substitute, in poet Howard
Nemerov’s words, “‘ a savior of our economy” for the Saviour
of Mankind, the Christmas service held Sunday night by the
UCA was a welcome reminder of what the phrase “Christmas

spirit” should mean.

Dr. Louis Hodges and Calvin Morrow, who were respon-
sible for the movingly effective Candlelight Service, are to be
thanked for reminding us that, regardless of our intellectual
enlightenment, there is still reason for old-fashioned humility

and honest religious inspiration.

We wish to join with Dr. Hodges, Morrow, and the UCA

in expressing our desire that

everyone have a meaningful

and happy Christmas season, and that we all keep in mind
those fundamental ideals for which the Yuletide tradition is

continued.

 

Pace Apologizes for Article;
Lists His “Ten Worst Flicks’

By TOM PACE

It seems appropriate to me that
I begin with an apology. Last week,
in my first column, I wrote five
hundred words that did not appear
in print. Due to a lack of experience
in writing columns for a newspaper,
and I guess, in writing period, I
wrote too much and was necessar-
ily cut. I apologize because it may
have left you with the wrong im-
pression.

“Manchurian” Re-Apprasial

In truth, I did indeed enjoy “The
Manchurian Candidate.” It was in-
teresting, suspenseful, had several
fine performances, and was, on the
whole, entertaining. My criticism of
it was with the screenplay and
Sinatra. The screenplay was ludi-
crous. Excepting this, it was none-
theless interesting. Sinatra was far
below the level that I expect of
him, and I suspect it was his fault.
Yet even with these flaws, I
thought the film was a success; and
I did recommend it to you. Enough
for “Manchuria.”

‘Great Flicks’ Unknown

The Washington Literary Society
held a panel discussion on films
the other night, with Mr. Boat-
wright, Mr. Davis, Mr. Shirey, and
Mr. Taylor as panelists. It was to
me interesting and informative. One
thing plagued me, however. Many
of the films that they referred to,
which are accepted as being great
movies, neither I nor anyone else
there had seen.

The next day I read over a list of
the thirty best films of all time (from
Sight and Sound’s International
Critic’s Poll). Of the thirty, I had
seen three. Why is it that we can’t
see these classics which are sup-
posed to be the great films? If the
Lexington theaters don’t bring them,

 

why isn’t there some society that
doth?
No Interest?

Perhaps the interest isn’t here. Yet
with a club of forty or fifty, one
could easily bring almost any film
on this list, or for that matter, al-
most any film at all that one would
like to see. The motion picture, as
funny as it may seem, is becoming
a medium of true art. Movies, like
novels, have their classics. It’s a
shame that at present we can’t see
them.

Ten Worst Flicks

At the end of each year, critics
throughout the States select their
best ten films lists. In an almost
mocking gesture, the Harvard Lam-
poon selects its ten worst, along
with a worst actor and worst actress.
In their selection, I would hope that
they might not pass over all the
following. Favorites in bold face.

Films: “If a Man Answers” (Bobby
Darin and Sandra Dee)

“Susan Slade” (Troy Donahue and
Connie Stevens)

“No Man Is an Island” (Jeffrey
Hunter)

“Five-Finger Exercise” (Rosalind
Russell and Richard Beymer)

“The 300 Spartans” (Richard Egan)

Actors: George Hamilton, IV
(“Light in the Piazza”), Jeffrey
Hunter, Troy Donahue, Richard
Beymer.

Actresses: Connie Stevens, Sandra
Dee, Rosalind Russell, Dorthy Mc-
Guire (for always being in Troy
Donahue movies).

Going from bad movies to good,
the two best flicks within 150 miles
are here at the Lyric and at the
Rockbridge in B.V.—‘“‘On the Water-
front” and “Lolita,” both are well
worth anybody’s time.

‘Abolish Present System’

Grades: Are They

By BILL LOWRY

One of the strong points of Wash-
ington and Lee has always been its
curriculum. Despite the fact that in
certain crucial areas a major over-
haul is needed, the curriculum as
it stands provides an opportunity
for a sound, basic liberal arts back-
ground, Furthermore, the faculty is,
for the most part, a good one, and
the caliber of work required is ade-
quate, although more challenge is
needed in certain areas.

Progress Being Made

Unfortunately, however, the aca-
demic and intellectual life at Wash-
ington and Lee stops at the class-
room door. Progress has been made
away from this direction. through
the establishment of discussions and
seminars such as those in English
and religion, but there is still a great
dichotomy between the academic and
non-academic spheres.

This prablem, it will be remember-
ed was discussed a great deal last
spring when it became evident that
a number of our better students were
leaving because Washington and Lee
did not provide a desirable intellec-
tual environment.

Emphasis Misplaced

Furthermore, even within the
classroom, the emphasis is not where
it should be: far too many of us
strive only for grades, rather than for
learning for its own sake. Fortu-
nately, the situation here is not as
bad as that at many northern

 

schools, where the competition for
grades is really cutthroat; for this
we can be thankful. Yet, all too many
of us strive only for a “gentleman’s
C” or a “Dean’s List B”; this misdi-
rected emphasis can do nothing but
abuse the learning process.

Bill Kinsey, in an article in last
Friday’s Ring-tum Phi referred to
the fact that several schools have
done away with grades altogether.
For Washington and Lee to under-
take such a venture would indeed
be a radical step; under our present
system, however, things are getting

worse, not better. As admissions
standards become higher, and com-
petition for graduate schools be-
comes keener, more and more em-
phasis is going to be placed on
grades.

Furthermore, the introduction of
the IBM machine to the campus has
removed the “personal touch” so
completely that a professor’s com-
ments on a_ students’ performance
have been reduced to no more than
a mechanical checking of an applic-
able category. For this reason, I
suggest that Washington and Lee
consider seriously the following pro-
posal.

Abolish Grades

Beginning at a set time in the near
future, all grades are to be abolish-
ed;the only notation to be noted on
one’s transcript is “Passed” or “Fail-
ed.”

In place of specific letter grades,
individual conferences between stu-

 

 

Honor Controversy Continues

 

Students And Teachers Speak Out on Issues

Hodges Clarifies Position
In Honor System Question

Lexington, Virginia
December 17, 1962

Editor
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:
I write regarding some _ issues

raised in last week’s interview with
Mr. Harrington on honor and the
Honor System. A number of conver-
sations have led me to think that a
further word or two might prevent
misunderstanding.

First let me congratulate you on
your desire to deal critically with so
deep and valuable a tradition as the
Honor System at Washington and
Lee. If the day ever comes in the
academic community when we re-
fuse to discuss and re-evaluate even
our most cherished traditions we will
have lost the distinctive ingredient
of academic life.

Critical Review of System Vital

A relative newcomer to Wash-
ington and Lee, I have come to
value our Honor System, perhaps as
much as some who have been here
longer than I. This does not mean
that I think the System is perfect
and not subject to critical review.
Indeed, it can live only if critically
reviewed by each new generation
of students. It is in this spirit, then,
that I write.

Turning to a substantive matter or
two, I wish to make three observa-
tions.

1) We need to distinguish carefully
between honor, an abstract virtue,
and the “Honor System,” a concrete
human institution at Washington and
Lee. I intended to direct my remarks
in last week’s interview more to
the subject of honor than to the
Honor System, though I am aware
that to discuss honor is implicitly to
discuss the Honor System.

System Defines Dishonor

Your editorial comment of last
week is well taken that the Honor
System defines what honor is not
rather than what it is. This was pre-
cisely my point, stated in different
words, that ours is much more near-
ly a legal than an honor system. I
do not feel that we should change the
name of the Honor System even
though the title is something of a
misnomer,

My point is simply that honor can-
not be systematized. There must re-
main a kind of healthy tension be-
tween the terms “Honor” and “Sys-
tem.” This is in keeping with your
point that we do not attempt to
codify honor, only dishonor.

Trend Towards Fear System

2) Honor Systems have a tendency
to resolve themselves into “fear”
systems. The “system” of enforce-
ment tends to call more attention to
itself than “honor,” the criterion of
application of the system. When this
shift in emphasis occurs a true hon-
or system is undermined.

I have received the impression

 

from a significant number of stu-
dents that a subtle shift from the
positive motive of honor to the nega-
tive motive of fear is currently
taking place at Washington and
Lee. If these students are correct,
our tradition is now entering a
period of major crisis.

If, moreover, such a shift in em-
phasis is occurring, the only
way to save the Honor System is
to take a fresh look at the nature
of honor with the limits and extent
of the Honor System. It was with
this in mind, incidentally, that I
agreed to the interview with Mr.
Harrington. Our appraisal of the
system must avoid the pressing
temptations to be dewey-eyed and
idealistic, a temptation always pres-
ent when serious ideals are in ques-
tion.

Relativity of Honor

3) The third matter on my mind
is that of the absoluteness or rela-
tivity of honor. You are, in my opin-
ion, only partly correct in your edi-
torial claim that “there is nothing
relative about lying, cheating, and
stealing.” These three terms, to be
sure, are subject to clear definition.
On the other hand, I am confident
that definitions of these terms dif-
fer among our students and faculty.
E.g., some would and some would
not include in the definition the
intent to steal.

Limitation Essential

Of greater importance than rela-
tivity, however, is the matter of the
limitation of the Honor System. We
do in fact, and I think we must,
limit the application of the System.
Some cases, especially of lying and
stealing, are not enforceable and
perhaps are not worthy of enforce-
ment. This is apparently the assump-
tion of many who do not want to
include lying at the ABC store un-
der the system.

Other cases of stealing are not re-
garded as honor offences—e.g., the
removal of silverware from local
eating places during fraternity par-
ties. This relativity in one meaning-
ful sense of that word. It seems to
me that we are obliged to acknowl-
edge these facts.

I hope that this letter will help to
clarify my position on honor. I
would regard it as an irreplaceable
loss to faculty and students alike if
our Honor System were to be lost
through the loss of respect on the
part of either students or faculty.

Sincerely,
LOUIS W. HODGES

Herman, Voice of Protest:
Onward, Christian Soldier!

Dear Dr. Hodges:

The article recently published
concerning your views on the Hon-
or System came as quite a pleasant
surprise to many of us who have
long felt as you do: that “honor” is
a relative and should be treated as
such.

Our problem lies, however, in con-

 

vincing the esteemed men of our
Executive Committee of the merits
of this belief, for it is they and only
they who can amend the present
system.

How, for instance, can one show
these men that they are the chosen
judge, jury and executioner of every
student in the University, and there-
fore should have the power to
weigh the evidence, arrive at a ver-
dict, and present a punishment suit-
able to the crime? Their insistance
that the present system is just and
morally right simply can not be
fought with rational arguments since
obviously opposing moral values are
involved.

Thus we are left with one choice,
and that cannot be made until next
May when the Student Body again
holds its annual elections.

In closing, I would like personally
to thank you for saying what should
have been said many years ago and
to let you know that you are not
fighting the battle alone.

Sincerely,

DICK HERMAN

Regarding the editorials appear-
ing in the Friday edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, I would like to con-
gratulate the paper for so skillfully
managing to retain its position in the
middle of the road. A professional
politician could not do better!

The annual crusade of the student
body seems, this year, to place most
of its emphasis upon the issues of
the exam schedules and cut system
revision. It is somewhat sad in a
school which places so much stress
upon student government and self-
rule (supposedly incurring a sense
of mature responsibility of action)
that the only permanent and official
voice of the students—the school
newspaper—continues to express
nothing more than a weak stand
(if it can be called a stand) on any
problem of a controversial nature.
What is wrong? Could it be that
the great tradition of self-govern-
ment is a failure? Or how much do
we really govern ourselves?

W&L: Self-Government?

These questions concerning the
success of W&L’s “self-government”
system are so old that I am almost
embarrassed to repeat them. I was,
nevertheless, always under the im-
pression that the prime function of
this unique (?) Washington and Lee
method was to better acquaint the
student with the necessity of choice
and responsible decision.

Once a man makes a decision, he
can never expect it to be effective
unless he is willing to put some
action behind it. Evidently the
Ring-tum Phi is behind some sort
of change in the present arrange-
ment of exams and cuts, but from
reading the editorials, I wonder if

A Hindrance To Academic

dents and professors are to take |
place at the end of the each semes- |

ter, and, perhaps, at the mid-se-
mester period as well; the reports
to parents will consist of the above
notation plus a personal comment
as to the student’s progress.

Comprehensive Exams
Then, in an effort to measure how
a student is really progressing, a
series of comprehensive examina-
tions will be given at the end of the
sophomore and senior years. So-
called “required” courses will be
done away with, but the compre-
hensive will cover a specific range
of subjects, which subjects are to
be given to the students at the be-

ginning of the freshman year.

This will enable the individual
who is good in English or history,
for example, to skip these courses in
favor of more advanced ones, thus
making it possible for each student
to work on his own weak points,
freeing him from material he has al-
ready covered.

Need Would Be Met

The subjects to be covered on the
comprehensives will be equivalent
to the present distribution require-
ments; in this way, the needs of
a basic liberal arts education will be
met, at the same time providing for
individual progress and _ initiative
The comprehensives themselves will
be graded only with “Passed” or
“Failed,” and a student who fails
will be allowed to take the examina-

 

tion over again at the beginning of
the next term.

Extensive Report on Each Student

At the end of the student’s career,
an extensive report will be written
for each student, covering the
amount of work covered, the quality
of work in each subject, and will
answer such questions as, “Has this
student lived up to his expected po-
potential?” This report will serve as
a student’s transcript, and together
with Graduate Record Examination
scores, will be the basis of his appli-
cation to graduate school.

‘A Radical Proposal’

Such a proposal sounds quite radi-
cal, and indeed it is. Furthermore, it
would place a great burden on both
the individual students and_ the
members of the faculty, calling for
a much more mature attude on the
part of both. And yet, look at the
advantages. The pressure which in-

 

evitably follows a rigid grading sys-
tem will be virtually done away
with.

In Order To Learn
Students will study in order to learn,
not to make a certain grade, and
progress will be judged according
to each individual’s progress rather
than according to an _ arbitrary
standard. Students (and professors)
could be freed from the burden of
countless hour quizzes merely for
the sake of determining a grade
point average, and education would
become a truly creative venture.
And, perhaps, most important, the

 

requirements of a good liberal arts |

education would be met without the
drags of innumerable required
courses, distribution points, etc.; and
such a program would further rec-
ognize that all learning need not
take place in the classroom.
Presupposes Responsibility
Such a proposal assumes, of
course,, the existence of a responsi-
ble student body and faculty who
recognize the burden such would
place on them; it also assumes that
a person who comes to college for
education, not a four-year party be-
fore entering the army or taking
over the family business.
Furthermore, today the mere reply
“But that would mean changing the
catalogue” is often enough to stifle
any proposed reform in the academic
life; if such an attitude is the pre-
vailing one, a proposal like the above
will get no further than this paper.
However, times are changing, and
Washington and Lee is changing;
every freshman class is more capable
of such discipline than the previous
one, If the college is to meet its re-
sponsibility in such a _ changing
world, it too must change, although
not without giving careful consider-
ation to each proposed change.

Piecemeal Changes
At present, any change in the
basic academic structure of Wash-
ington and Lee has been on a piece-
meal basis, with each department
revising its own curriculum when
it feels the need, and with little or

 

 

the paper really believes in the de-
cisions it makes.

Editorials Trite, Ineffective

Each of the editorials concerning
cuts and exams were remarkably
similar. The problem was _ stated
fairly (this is merely news), but
when it came to the expression of
an opinion of some nature, each did
nothing more than to fill the column.
They abounded with such trite inef-
fective phrases as “we hope,” “it
seems,” or “while”’—while we may
not succeed in this accomplishment,
something elce might come up.

The editorial on exam scheduel-
ing admits that the faculty resolu-
tion “has no conerete meaning,”
but then goes no further than to say
that such slight faculty action as
was taken is “heartening” and that
we can have “hope.”

Concedes the Battle

In a like manner, the editorial on
cuts concedes the battle before it
has even really been undertaken. It
states that, “chances of having un-
limited cuts for everyone with a
one point average are remote.” Cer-
tainly the chances are remote if we
aren't going to put something be-
hind them! Moreover, the fact re-
mains that the paper offered no
strong and sensible alternative, but
only expressed a watered down
“hope” for change—perhaps “a so-
cial penalty”—sometime in that all
too vague “near future.”

The ‘Hope’ Is Obvious

When 80 per cent of the student
body bothers to sign a petition (one
that advocates more than just a
simple change), it is obvious that
“hope” already exists. What is need-
ed now is some sort of positive spirit
to spark and kindle further hope. It
rests in individuals such as John
Kirkley but not in the Ring-tum
Phi.

The fact remains that the paper is
lacking either in the courage or
the ability to take a strong stand
on what it feels should be done. It
gives us only an indication of what
will be done (namely nothing) as
long as it is afraid to put some
strong action behind its decisions in
order to test their worth.

GARRETT KRATZIG

Lowry’s Integration Plan
Called South’s Only Hope

To the Editor:

Last week a fellow student pub-
lished an article in the Ring-tum
Phi entitled “Integration: Are We
Shirking Our Duty?” Many of us
read it, but some did not. There
was a notable tendency for some
students to disregard the article
simply because of the word “inte-
gration” in its title. Is it ever wise
for us to disregard an opinion on
a problem which concerns us, and
especially this one, merely because it
might be opposed to our own line

(Continued on page 4)

Pursuits?

no regard for the overall picture.
Thus, basic errors in the structure
are preserved, and many inconsisten-
cies are added, as is seen for ex-
ample, in the fact that some depart-
ments require comprehensive ex-
aminations for graduation and others
do not.
Complete Revision

For this reason, I suggest a com-
mittee be appointed to study such
proposals as the above, with the
intention of a complete revision of
the present system. Such a commit-
tee should consist of student lead-
ers, faculty and administrative of-
ficials, and, perhaps, even one or
two thoughtful alumni. Such a com-
mittee would study the program at
other liberal arts colleges, perhaps
meeting with their officials, and re-
turn a detailed report on how to re-
vitalize the academie framework at
Washington and Lee.

It must, of course, be remembered
that Washington and Lee is Wash-
ington and Lee, and not Reed, An-
tioch, Swarthmore, or any other col-
lege. And yet, this should not deter
us from trying to meet our role to
the best of our ability. We can learn
from others as others can learn from
us. All that needs to be done is to
make the effort.

Our work in establishing the
newly-formed College Athletic Con-
ference has been righly praised, and
indeed it should be.

If we can play such an important
role in the area of athletics, why not
in the academic sphere as well?

The free throw, a part of basket-
ball usually taken for granted,
proved to be Washington and Lee’s
weakness for the second straight
game as Centre’s Colonels posted an
82-78 College Athletic Conference

win over the Generals Saturday
night.

Frosh To Win

Led by the hot hand of forward
Steve Sweitzer, Washington and
Lee’s freshman basketball team
rolled to its second win of the season
Friday, ripping Fishburne Military
Academy, 96-41.

The Baby Generals capitalized on
a fast-break offense to raise the
season record to 2-4.

Fast Break

“We got 40-45 points off our fast
break,” said coach Joe Lyles, “This
was the first time that it really jived.
We got the ball off the board and
went.”

Fred Mindel with 12 points and
John Moore with 13 points aided
Sweitzer in the scoring department.

The Generals jumped off to a 31-
10 lead in the first period. The
second period was a close affair as
W&L tallied 15 points to Fishburne’s
eight, pushing the Generals into a
46-18 halftime lead.

‘Late Centre Rally Sinks Generals, 82-5 78

opponents from the field, fell to their
fifth loss of the season against only
one win. W&L converted only 16 of
29 foul shots while Centre made
good on 22 of 30.

Wallis, Paterno Star

Terrific shooting by guards Don
Wallis and Louie Paterno boosted
the Generals into a ten-point lead
midway through the second half.

Wallis, who is finally beginning to
come into his own as a _ scorer,
swished the nets with five of seven
shots in the second half. Paterno,
sophomore playmaker who averaged
11.0 points as a freshman, converted
four of seven shots from the floor
and eight of ten free throws.

The Generals, paced by the long-
range bombing of guard Brett
Thackston, moved into a 33-32 half-
time lead over the shabby-looking
Colonels.

A Second Half Surge

After intermission, W&L stormed
back on the strong right arm of
Paterno. The little Charleston, W.
Va. Guard made six straight points
and nine of the Generals’ first 11
points in the second half to vault
W&L into a 44-36 lead.

Three more points by Paterno, a
field goal by Rodger Fauber and
three points by freshman center Bob
Spessard gave the Generals their
biggest lead of the night, 52-42.

Centre Rallies

Centre, led by Hal Smith and Dan-
ny Marks, broke out of its field goal
famine and whittled the margin to
42-51 before Wallis hit three straight
goals.

Inept Generals

Making its worst offensive show-
ing in four years, Washington and
Lee’s Basketball team fell to Catho-
lic University, 65-41, Monday night
at Catholic.

Not since W&L managed only 25
points in losing to Virginia Tech,
105-25, in 1958-59, has a General
team failed to pass the 45-point
mark in scoring.

This made only the fifth time in
12 years that a W&L team has not
tallied at least 35 points in a game.

Fauber Scores 12

Rodger Fauber was the only Gen-
eral who broke into double figures,
scoring 12.

Catholic jumped into a command-
ing 35-13 lead as W&L played one
of its poorest halves in years.

The Generals bounced back in the
second half, scoring 28 points to
Catholic’s 30.

The loss lowered the Generals’
record to 1-6. Catholic is now 3-4,

Tri-captain Dave Montgomery and

second places.

Montgomery, wrestling in the 130-

matches to reach the finals against
Virginia Tech’s Roger Lovern.

The senior star decisioned Mike
Godlewski of Georgia, 8-5, and
whipped John McCall of Virginia,
4-3, in prelims. In the finals Lovern
scored a 4-2 triumph.

Winfield also captured two match-
es on his way to the finals of the
157-pound class. He pinned David
Wheeler of Georgia and whipped
Henry Starnes of Auburn in over-
time on a referee’s decision.

Virginia’s Alexander Wells, the
tournament's top wrestler, ended
Winfield’s win string with a 4-1
victory for the championship.

BY 0. E. SCHOEFFLER, eEsauire’s Fashion Director

Many a young man adds accessories to his wardrobe by letting rela-
tives—a maiden aunt who “can’t resist cute novelties’—pick out
his belts, hose and sleepwear at birthdays and Christmastime. The
results are, naturally enough, often cute—and always disastrous.
Elegance in dress extends beyond a man’s exterior, and shows in
his knowledgeable attention to detail. Accessories are an integral
part of every wardrobe, and the truly well-stocked wardrobe doesn’t
end with what can be seen at first glance.

PULL UP YOUR PANTS! aithough most

of today’s slacks are styled with expan-
sion waistbands and side-tab adjustments,
many men still add a touch of color to
their slacks with a belt. A ribbon striped
fabric belt, with leather ends and a small
brass buckle, lends color contrast to solid
color slacks. Double and triple vertical
stripes, in 2 or 8 colors, are the dominant
trend, with some belts seen in all-over
multicolor stripes.

For sportswear coordination with patterned shirts or jackets, try
a fabric belt in a tweedy, rough-textured finish, in charcoal brown
or black-olive. With your suits, the calfskin belt in dark brown,
black or olive remains de rigeur.

THE FINAL FLOURISH +++ With any tailored apparel is the breast

pocket handkerchief, worn in a loose square fold or soft puff style.
Some matching neckwear and handkerchief sets are available, but
most muted paisleys and madder prints stand on their own in colors
to coordinate with your suit. And for your after-dark wear, a
splash of solid color silk is a solid compliment to your taste.

TRADITIONAL ARGYLES + »+remain the favorite pattern in socks,

and young men in particular like these colorful ankle lengths. Solids
with argyle side panels are slightly more dressy. For wear with
your tailored apparel, solid color wool and wool blends are a best
bet, especially in heathertone blends with a wide rib effect. For
really leisure leisurewear, the athletic ribbed white sock, banded on
top with colorful stripes, remains the campus favorite.

‘ IF YOU WANT TO PLAY TARZAN...

that’s your business. But pajamas really
are more comfortable than your under-
wear for sleeping. The traditional men’s
pajama is usually of solid color or white
broadcloth, with a pullover or jacket-type
top. Bright and bold colors can be seen
this year. A more recent development on
the sleepwear fashion scene is the sports-
wear-inspired pajama, with a cross-stripe
knit top contrasted with solid color broad-
cloth trousers that are styled like slacks
with an expansion waistband and side

ise elastic.
4% ROBE, PIPE AND SLIPPERS . . . is the

traditional trio for solid late evening com-
fort. To the college man, or any man away
from home, his robe assumes an impor-
tant role in his wardrobe. The classic robe
is of solid color wool flannel, and can
usually be seen in blue, tan, gray, maroon
and black. Also in wool, or blends of wool
and cotton, you may like the bright
splashes of color in wrap-around belted
plaids and tartans. Either style assures
you solid, and fashionable comfort.

THE PATTER OF LITTLE FEET »»+may make a warm and homey

cliche, but the idea is pretty uncomfortable when they’re your bare
little feet padding around the cold dormitory floor. Slippers in
comfortable mocassin design, of soft brown or black leather with
a pile fabric lining, can keep you warm through the winter. If you
prefer a dressier slipper, there is the traditional soft, plain toe
slipper of unlined leather with a cushion sole. A newer idea is the
boot-type high-riser slipper, also of leather, and usually black with
a warm pile lining. And don’t forget a pair of shower-clog rubber
sandals for those jogs to the shower and back,

THE HOLIDAY SEASON » +» is the peak season for proms, balls,

cotillions, dances, blasts, and just plain parties. If you’re thinking
about your formalwear—and you should be—watch for next month’s

of thought? And should we be op-
posed to the suggestion put forth
by Bill Lowry?

Two Southern Problems

As this writer sees it, we of the
South are faced with two general
problems—our relative poverty and
our racial frictions. But are these
two in actuality not one, and do
they not feed upon each other?

In supporting a dual school sys-
tem we place upon ourselves the
burden of providing at much great-
er expense the same education as
those who support a single school
system. Now this would be fine, if
we had a great deal more to spend
on education than they. But of
course we do not.

Inferior Education

Yet each year we give our school
children a comparatively inferior
education and expect them and our
Southland to compete with the rest

of the country. But from inferior |

education comes an inferior com-

| of two systems, but we could at the

|same time learn to live with equal

dignity as men. Thus we could solve
two problems at once .

| Process Will Be Thorny

The process of integrating south-
ern school systems is and will not
be any bed of roses. It is not im-
portant here to attempt to list the
problems which accompany this pro-
cess, but whatever they may be, they
can be lessened if we accept their
existence and try to intelligently
solve them. We have hidden from
our problems long enough.

Where Are Our Leaders?

It seems that too often today the
people trying to bring about some
sort of solution to racial conflicts
are of the other race. Where are the
leaders of our own? It has long been
accepted that Washington and Lee
University is a leader in the South
in education and in providing the
South with leaders. We now have an
opportunity to provide leadership
once again by facing the problems

selves deeper into the problem each
year. We may raise the level of
southern education with technologi-
cal advances and other devices, but
we will never be able to efficiently
compete in this field until the real
problems are tackled.

Should the South have the cour-
age to challenge tradition and to
reconcile her racial differences, she
might find great profit by it in the
long run. With the implementation
of integration in our public school
system, we in the South could find
a good start in helping ourselves.
