C. P. Haskins To Speak At ODK Assembly

Four Congressional Aides
To Speak Here Monday

By JIM LEDBETTER

Four Congressional aides
Scenes in Congress” in a panel

The public session is scheduled for 7:30 p-m. in the jour-
nalism lecture room in Payne Hall. The panelists—all Wash-

ington and Lee graduates—will be Robert S. Bradford, _ad-

ministrative assistant to Rep. Rich-*———

ard Poff; Norman L. Dobyns, admin-
istrative assistant to Rep. Thomas
N. Downing; Andrew H. McCutch-
eon, executive secretary to Rep. J.
Vaughan Gary; and Robert B. Mc-
Neil, legislative assistant to Sen. A.
Willis Robertson.

The discussion will be moderated
by Prof. O. W. Riegel, head of the
university’s department of journal-
ism and communications, which is
sponsoring the session. Each of the
visiting aides will make introduc-
tory statements, followed by discus-
sion and questions from the au-
dience.

Bradford

The senior member of the group,
from the standpoint of Washington
service, is Bradford, who gradu-
ated in 1955. He has been with
veteran Republican legislator Poff
since 1957, and is a native of Blacks-
burg, Va.

McNeil

Robert B. McNeil, '47, is also from
Blacksburg originally, and has serv-
ed as legislative assistant to Robert-
son since 1960.

McCutcheon

Andrew H. McCutcheon, Jr., *48,
formerly of Charleston, W. Va., but
later of Richmond, has been execu-
tive secretary to Gary since 1960.
Previously, he served two terms as
president of the Southern Confer-
ence of Sports Writers, and pub-
lished in Best Sports Short Stories,
E. P. Dutton.

Dobyns

Norman L. Dobyns, ’54, a native
of Newport News, joined Rep.
Downing’s staff as his administra-
tive assistant in 1960, also.

All four engaged in some form of
news work after graduating from
W&L, where they all majored in
journalism. Their journalistic back-
grounds are particularly valuable
in handling the various press con-
tacts that Senators and Congressmen
must maintain. The panel discussion
will center around the insight they
have gained into the workings of
Congress during the years they have
been there.

Notice

The second flu shot will be given
to the freshmen and dorm counsel-
ors beginning Monday, December 3.
Upperclassmen and law students will
receive their second shot from De-
cember 10 to 19. All shots will be
given from 7-9 p.m. Monday through

Plays Dec. 7

Internationally acclaimed  violin-
ist Hyman Bress will play here
Friday, December 7, under the au-
spices of the Concert Guild. The |
performance is set for 8 p.m. in}
duPont Auditorium.

 

Musician Bress was born in Cape-
town, South Africa. He began study- |
ing violin there at the age of five. |
Within four years he was playing}
with the Capetown Municipal Or-
chestra. At 15 he won a scholarship
to the Curtis Institute, where he
studied with Ivan Galamian. He
was graduated from the institute in
1951.

Wins Numerous Awards

Since then he has been touring
all over the world. In 1956 Mr.
Bress won the Concert Artists’ Guild
Award. The following year he won
the Jascha Heifetz Award at Tangle-
wood, and last year he received the
coveted Harriet Cohen Common-
wealth Medal.

After receiving wide acclaim for
his radio and television appearance
in Canada, he was invited to make
his debut in London with the Royal

Philharmonic Orchestra under Sir
Adrian Bout.
In his Lexington concert, Mr.

Bress will play Bach’s “Partita in D
Minor for Solo Violin Number Two,”
Bartok’s “Solo Sonata,’ Jean-Marie

Saint-Saens’ “Introduction and Ron-
do Capriccioso.”
Leyburn to Accompany

Bress on several
pieces will be Dr. James G. Leyburn,
chairman of the Washington and
Lee sociology department.

Mr. Bress has received favorable
reviews wherever he has _ played.
The New York Herald-Tribune said
of his work “His tone was warm and
attractive, and the playing had a
quality of romantic passion not often
found in the playing of young art-
ists.”

A London reviewer said of a Bress
concert “ . a tone as broad as a|
river and bowing technique of un-
common authority. I do not remem-
ber any fiddle producing such sheer
bigness of tone as this .. .”

‘Playboy’

To relieve any possible ‘‘war
tensions” of the Fancy Dress
Civil War celebration, the Phi
Kaps are planning to blast off
63 FD with a Playboy
Cocktail Party.

Given in honor of senior

the

Ham Emory, President of this

year’s Fancy Dress, the cock-
tail party is breaking away from
tradition in what promises to be a
full-scale rejuvenation.

To be held at the Mayflower
Hotel, it will have all the character-
istic Playboy paraphernalia: bunny
rabbits, balloons, and free souvenirs.

“Everything possible is being
done,” commented Doug Campbell,
FD vice-president in charge of the
cocktail party, “to reproduce the
authentic Playboy Club for the oc-
casion.”

Special lighting will be set up to}
help furnish an atmosphere. Chairs |
and tables will be amply provided, |
with plenty of space reserved for)

Campbell remarked that the table |
and chair arrangement will be solv- |
ing a major problem. “By having |
the crowd properly spread out,” he |
stated, “we hope to avoid the con-
gestion which has so badly plagued |
previous cocktail parties.”

In addition, Campbell is having
exhaust fans installed to eliminate |
the smoke and heat “which in the
past parties have become almost un- |
bearable.” i

W&L Receives

Various Gifts

From Friends
Sears, Retbuck Co.

Washington and Lee University
has received $1,000 from Sears, Roe-
buck Co. through the company’s
program of aid to privately-
supported colleges and universities.

The receipt of a check from E. O.
Jr., manager of the Lex-
was an-
nounced today by Washington and
Lee President Fred C. Cole. The
grant, not yet designated, is unre-
stricted.

The gift is the first grant to
Washington and Lee from Sears,
Roebuck.

Under the new Sears program, 13

Virginia colleges and_ universities
are sharing in grants. Some 557
institutions of higher learning

throughout the country will receive
grants from Sears, Roebuck this
year.

Silhouettes

Antique silhouettes of George and
Martha Washington in gold leaf
frames have been presented to
Washington and Lee by the widow
of an alumnus.

President Fred C. Cole accepted
the gift for the university from
Mrs. William Cole Davis, whose late
husband, Dr. William Cole Davis
of Lexington, was a member of the
Class of 1904.

Mrs. Davis acquired the sil-
houettes during a recent visit to
her former home in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, Canada. A friend, Mrs.
R. R. Counsell of Winnipeg, gave
the finely detailed likenesses to
Mrs. Davis because of their rela-
tionship to her adopted state.
Mrs. Counsell had found the sil-
houettes in a Winnipeg antique
shop, whose proprietor recalled
that he had purchased them from
“an American woman,”

Mrs. Davis told Mrs. Counsell that
she intended to give the silhouettes
to Washington and Lee, and Mrs.
Counsell was pleased with this dis-
position.

The frames are 14 inches tall
and 12 inches wide. The likenesses
of Washington and his wife are
two and a half inches tall.

President Cole thanked Mrs. Davis

 

their |

 

for the “important additions” to the

related to George Washington and
Robert E. Lee.

Tape Recorder

A stereophonic tape recorder and
a motion picture sound camera have
been given to the department of
journalism and communications at
Washington and Lee University.

An Ampex 601-2 tape recorder,
scheduled for use in the depart-
ment’s Communications Laboratory,
is the gift of Gilmore N. Nunn,
1931 Washington and Lee alumnus
from Lexington, Ky. Nunn gave the
Communications Laboratory its first
tape recorder in 1950. That recorder
is still in use.

WDBJ-TV (Channel 7) in Roa-
noke has turned an Auricon sound
camera over to the department. The
camera will be used in connection
with documentary and other film
production and for recording signi-
ficant events on the campus, accord-
ing to Prof. O. W. Riegel, head of
the department of journalism and
communications. The camera is the
first sound type for the department.

The Forty-Eighth Annual
Ceremony To Be Held Dec. 10

By STEVE GUILD

Dr. Caryl P. Haskins, President of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington, will be the guest speaker for the 48th Annual

The yearly event will be held this year on December 10
to recognize outstanding leadership abilities in students, faculty,

The Tap Ceremony will be held at 12:00 and will be

—————# followed by a luncheon for old and

new members in Evans Dining Hall.

Dr. Haskins, a native of Schenect-
ady, New York, is now President of
the Carnegie Institution of Washing-
ton. He received a Ph.B. degree from
Yale University in 1930 and a Ph.D.
from Harvard in 1935. During the
early 1930’s he was employed as
a research chemist with General
Electric’s Research Laboratory, and
in 1935 he moved to M. I. T. where
he did extensive research in the
biological sciences. In 1939, Dr. Has-
kins became president of the Na-
tional Photocolor Association, a po-
sition he held until he became asso-
ciated with the Carnegie Institution
in 1955.

The educator has been a con-
sultant and advisor to various
governmental agencies ever since
the early days of World War Il.
During the war be was a member
of several committees including
the National Defense Research
Committee. Following the war he
became chairman of the Advisory
Committee to the Secretary of De-
fense on certain special weapons.
He has been a consultant to the
Secretary of Defense and contin-
ues to be a consultant to the Sec-
retary of State.

Dr. Haskins is a member of Phi
Beta Kappa and has received the
Presidential Certificate of Merit for
outstanding service to the Govern-
ment during World War II. He has
also received the King’s Medal for
Service in the Cause of Freedom in
Great Britain. He has received hon-
orary degrees from nine colleges
among them Tufts College, Yale
University, and the Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology.

The speaker is a trustee of a num-
ber of institutions and a member
in many more societies and associa-
tions. Dr. Haskins has served as a
trustee of the Carnegie Institution,
The Rand Corporation, Educational
Testing Service, Yale University,
and as a regent of the Smithsonian
Institution. He is also a member of
the Board of Directors for the Coun-
cil on Foreign Relations and Frank-
lin Publications. He is a fellow of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, the American Association
for the Advancement of Science and
the Royal Entomological Society of
Great Britain. In addition he is a
member of some 55 different asso-
ciations and societies.

Omicron Delta Kappa was
founded 48 years ago at Washing -
ton and Lee for the purpose of
“bringing together campus lead-
ers in a more relaxed atmosphere.”
From that time the honorary fra-
ternity has grown in stature until
there are now over ninety chap-
ters or circles at universities and
colleges throughout the country.

The idea for the organization of
a society to recognize superior
citizenship and leadership came

from Professor of Political Science
Emeritus and Special Assistant to
the President Rupert N. Latture and
his roommate James C. Fisher. The
purpose of the newly-formed
group was threefold: (1) to recognize
men who have attained efficiency in
collegiate activities; (2) to bring to-

gether the most representative men
in all phases of College life; and

(3) to collect members of the facul-
ty and student body on a basis of
mutual interest and understanding

No One Goes To Lectures

This past week the student body has been privileged to have
excellent poets appear as lecturers in the current Glasgow
series. We are very fortunate to be able to have these distin-

guished men on our campus.

Their appearance, as well as the appearance of other lec-

turers, is designed to increase

the intellectual atmosphere of

the campus. More important, these lectures are held for the
benefit and pleasure of the students.

However, this idea does not seem to have been conveyed to
the student body. Unfortunately, far too few of the students
here have been taking advantage of these lectures. Their at-
tendance at these lectures has been shamefully low.

What is the cause? Who is to blame? A number of sug-
gested reasons may be set forth. Lack of stimulation by the

professors and lack of student

interest would seem to be the

most obvious answers. This does not mean that either or
both are necessarily at fault. The answer is not that simple.
There are many factors which must be considered.

To some, the answer is simple and apparent. They simply
drag out the old tag of campus apathy and hang it up as the
reason for any of our problems.

To be sure, this may well be a part of our problem. How-

ever, it could not possibly be

the single solution. The solu-

tion must lie with each individual. He must decide for himself.
He must decide to what extent he wishes to develop his mind.
We regret that the attendance has not been better and we

hope that future lectures will

attract more student interest.

However, we do not feel that the student body can justifiably
demand bigger and better lecture programs when they do not
support an excellent one such as this.

 

‘Booze-Savoir’ Proposed
For College Curriculum

By PETE ALFORD
Friday Columnist
“Eat, drink and be merry for to-
morrow you may die.”
Motto, Slater Service

We were reading the Washington
Post the other day and came across
an article of much
merit and interest
which we feel
should be pointed
- out to the students
of Washington and
Lee.

The article told
of a wine-tasting
“seminar” held at
Columbia Univer-
sity. It seems
that representa-
tives of American
and French wine producers are visit-
ing various campuses and _ holding
one-day student-sponsored  semi-
nars to teach the nation’s youth
about their vintages. The companies
supply the wine and the lecturer
and the school supplies the winos
and the classroom. At Columbia they
invited Barnard coeds to the lecture
and tasting session and apparently
had a great time.

Why Not Here?

After reading the article we took
the liberty of writing the student
who sponsored the affair at Colum-
bia and have received from him
recently the address of the wine
company to contact. If sufficient
student support for this project can

 

Alford

 

be mustered we don’t see any reason
for not going ahead with the pre-
liminary planning.

Of course, we are faced at the out-
set with the problem of choosing
the best group or organization on
campus to sponsor the blowout.
Should the honor go to the EC,
IFC, UCA, Conservative Society—
just what organization should prop-
erly handle the seminar?

Some feel it should go to the
House Manager’s Association or
SWMSFC, because they haven’t got
much else to do. Others think it
more appropriate for Sigma, the
“13” Club, the Mongolian Minks, or
some other one of our so-called
“drinking” societies to sponsor the
thing.

We suggest turning the whole
issue of sponsorship over to the
Debate Society for deliberation.
We should all abide by their de-
cision and the designated organi-
zation will then proceed with the
planning.

If this wine-tasting class ever ma-
terializes we can see a tremendous
future for university-sponsored li-
bating. Why stop at wines? Scanning
our handy Alcoholic Beverage Con-

trol Board price list, we notice over “

200 companies represented. We
could have different lecturers bring
their samples of bourbon, scotch, gin,
rye, vodka, rum, etc., and have
tasting sessions the year out. Unite,
students, let’s bring this wine lec-
turer and his wares to W&L!

Origin Of Anonymous Abstract
Creates Mystery For Junkin

The following account relates
the experiences of Professor
Marion Junkin with a mysterious
painting on the W&L campus. The
abstraction was found among a
group of paintings by Pierre
Daura exhibited in Evans Hall,

—The Editors

The Mystery of the Bumblee or
Who Painted What and When

The Professor of Art strolled
through the exhibition reviewing in
pleasant aesthetic contemplation the
paintings that had been hung in the
gallery the week before. While
hanging the paintings he had been
busy with wire and screws and
the proper placement. Now he could
enjoy the exhibition. Suddenly the
Professor did a double-take. Where
once there had been a blank space
there now hung an abstraction. Not
bad, he thought, but where did it
come from and by what unknown
genius was the work created. A
very free and dynamic abstraction he
mused, climaxed by a very dead
bumblebee impaled, feet in air, in
the center of a glob of paint. A rare
climax, he mused. Why have I not
thought of this before?

The professor contacted the press,
called his private eye, Nero Wolf,

 

and the wheels of investigation
were rolling. In an interview re-
leased by the A.P. he stated, “This
is indeed a new trend. With paint-
ings being stolen all over the world
and for a masterpiece to appear un-
solicited, may herald a new trend
in art.”

The telephone rang in the Profes-
sor’s office. Nero Wolf spoke in his
usual crpytic private investigator
tone of voice. “The answer is con-
tained in a passage from Ovid,
Metamorphoses Book XV, “The
Workship of Aesculapius, Line 155;

“Ill habits gather by unseen de-

grees,

As brooks make rivers

rivers run to the seas’.”
Wolf grunted adding a remark about
his usual fee, “And do not bother
me with such trivia again, as my
orchids need my attention.”

The Professor mused—brooks,
brooks—rivers, rivers. Ah, how
simple, it was, but anyway it was a
damn good abstraction.

Cycle Imagery Of Eliot’s Poem
Is Discussed By Guest Critic

By GARETH ADEN

The noted critic and_ scholar,
Northrop Frye, was the lecturer
Wednesday night for the Forty-

Second Washington and Lee Semi-
nar in Literature.

The lecture was held in duPont
Auditorium which was filled to ca-
pacity. The topic of the lecture
was: “The Structure of Imagery in
Modern Poetry.”

Dr. Frye graduated from Victoria
College of Canada in 1933 as a
major in Philosophy and English.
After three years in seminary, he
was ordained a priest in the United
Church of Canada but soon realized
that his vocation was _ university
teaching. He attended Merton Col-

 

lege, Oxford, and received his M.A.
there.

Returning to Victoria College
he received his full professorship
in 1947 and later became Chairman
of the English Department. Dr.
Frye is now the Principal of the
College. During these years he has
had occasion to teach at Harvard,
Columbia, Princeton, Indiana Uni-
versity, and the University of
Washington.

As a critic, Dr. Frye has become
well known for books such as Fear-
ful Symmetry, Anatomy of Criticism,
and Sound and Poetry. He is recog-
nized as an authority on both Mil-
ton and Blake.

 

He became a Fe'low of the Royal
Society of Canada in 1951 and in
1958 received the Society’s “Lorne
Pierce Medal” for distinguished con-
tribution to Canadian literature.

In introducing Dr. Frye, Profes-
sor A. R. Borden, pointed out the
great respect and “awe” that Dr.
Frye’s colleaguges of the literary
world hold for him.

In beginning his discussion of
the structure of imagery in mod-
ern poetry, the well known critic
pointed out that poets had to fol-
low a basic and set structural
pattern in their imagery. This was
because they had to associate the
set natural world to the human

 

VMI Cadets Rebel Against
Raids, Drinking Restrictions

By JIM LEDBETTER

While W&L students have been
quietly going about their day-to-day
routine during the past week, ob-
livious to goings-on outside their
pecularly isolated academic com-
munity, the neighboring campus of
the Virginia Military Institute has
been the scene of a quiet but pow-
erful rebellion against social in-
justice in its worst form.

It all started last weekend. In-
stead of going home for Thanks-
giving, VMI students engaged in
the traditional Ring Figure Week-
end, several days of fun and mer-
riment patterned after the Wash-
ington and Lee Dance Set. Drink-
ing is forbidden at these affairs,
but there is a long-standing tra-
dition that parties at which drink-
ing takes place will not be visited
by faculty members.

This tradition was violated on
Saturday night. A party began at
2 p.m. at the skating rink between
Lexington and Buena Vista. Bottles
were passed around, and the cadets

 

imbibed freely, secure in their belief
that the decades-long tradition
would not be broken. At 6 p.m., sev-
eral Tactical Officers arrived on the
scene and proceeded to arrest ten.

The cadet underground came in-
to being. The word was spread
through barracks. The leaders,
realizing that active rebellion was
out of the question, patterned
their method after Ghandi’s pas-
sive resistence and called for a
hunger strike. On Monday night,
only fifty students out of one
thousand reported for dinner,
Seeing that the mobs were grow-
ing restless, the leaders decided that
a change in tactics was desirable.
Since the next officer in charge was
to be a West Point graduate, they
adopted a method of protest used
in that institution: silence. At this
writing, not one word has been
spoken in the VMI mess hall since
Tuesday.

In order to prevent the offending
students from expulsion the Junior
and Senior classes have promised

 

to abstain from the evils of drink for

the remainder of the year. The
principle, however, remains. The
leader of the underground ex-
pressed their sentiments in these

words: “We are not complaining
against the underhanded way in
which the raid was carried out, or
even against the breaking of the
tradition which has allowed us to
drink in secret for so many years.
Ultimately, our protest is against the
drinking rule itself.”

These are noble words. We of
W&L, with a long tradition of
freedom from tryanny of this kind,
must offer sympathy and express
our desire to help; however, they
can certainly understand that our
position of non-involvement, pat-
terned after the U.S. policy toward
India in the past weeks, is one that
we must adhere to under all cir-
cumstances. A program of “Aid
Without Consequences,” coupled
with our encouragement, should be
undertaken immediately. Tell your
neighbor.

A Year Of ‘Exploration’ Is Urged
For Orientation Of Freshmen Students

By BILL KINSEY

All upperelassmen have laughed at
the confusion and utter bewilder-
ment of the green
freshmen. Newly
introduced to the
college campus,
naivete is the
source of univer-
* sal humor as he
_ stumbles along,
* looking for the
right thing to say,
the proper places
to go, the correct
thing to wear. But
laughter that
greets his beanie-topped appearance
is mostly sympathetic; it stems from
an understanding of his situation,
a memory of having gone through
the same thing in the past. Perhaps,
however, the attitude that is more
appropriate toward these new fresh-
men is one of pity; for, after all of
the color and excitement of rush
week is over, they will be thrown
into the biggest mess of their lives—
the curriculum of the freshman year.

 

Kinsey

The freshman who plunges into
Biology 1, French 1, Introduction
to Analysis, Critical Reading and
Writing, and European Civilization
wonders just what all of this has
to do with him. And he has a
right to wonder. He has been har-
nessed into an apparatus directed
by an alien will that makes no eall
upon him to exercise his individual
initiative. All that is asked is that
he obediently do the work assigned
to him. If he does this, he is told,
in the due course of four years he
will receive his diploma and go into
the world an educated man. He is in
no way given any real idea what his
relation to his courses is to be or

 

what purpose the course may be able
to serve for him. All he is given
is that this or that course “will ful-
fill your distribution requirement.”
And what does the distribution re-
quirement mean to him? Does any-
one explain? No.

The freshman feels that he is
being fed a collection of disjointed
data, and he is right. When he
finishes college and goes on to
whatever he chooses, most of these
courses will become mere relics of
what was supposed to have been
an education. All he will remem-
ber is, “Doctor————? Oh, yes,
he’s the one who taught that
junior course in literature, or was
it history.” Because he was never
related to his curriculum, his cur-
riculum will bear no relation to
him.

The Catalogue states:

The courses specified for the
freshman year have been so chos-
en that, upon their completion,
the student will be in a position
to proceed toward the degree of
Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Sci-
ence, or Bachelor of Science with
special attainments in Commerce,
or toward special work prepara-
tory to law or medicine. There
are minor differences in the work
in foreign languages and mathe-
matics in the courses leading to
various objectives, and these dif-
ferences make it advisable for the
student’s courses to be selected, so
far as possible, with his complete
program in view.

Now who will say that the aver-
age freshman registered with his
faculty adviser for the first semester
of his college year has any idea
of what his “complete program” will

 

be? We hurry to pigeonhole him,
classify him, and get him into his
niche in society and the business
world after giving him the briefest
imaginable glance at all the possi-
bilities open to him. He is urged
to specialize, to get into a field and
stay there. We have, in effect, made
him into a limited individual rather
than a specialist. We ignore the fact
that specialization, if it is to be for
the benefit of the individual, must
occur naturally and often quite
slowly. Allowances must be made
for the late bloomer. It is nothing
less than an academic sin to take
a boy who is unsure about any call-
ing and compel him to fit into one
or another mold just because he has
reached the second semester of his
sophomore year. If this is done, ac-
quiring an education becomes noth-
ing more than a dreary and unreal
game.

There can be no prescription for
gaining mature use of knowledge
of studies. In a significant sense
studies must adapt to the student
if the finished product of the col-
lege is to be of any value. Studies
become significant when they en-
able the student to learn some-
thing in particular that he wishes
to know or to find out what he
should know. The crucial question
is not that of what subjects
“ought” to be taught but that of
whether the knowledge contained
in a course will make any differ-
ence to the student. This must be
the ultimate criterion.

It has been a frequent comment
on this campus that what is needed
before any changes could be at-
tempted on the part of the faculty
and the administration is a new at-

world in a way that could be
widely understood. As a general
rule, then, Dr. Frye explained,
the mind separates the world into
the desirable ideal and the actual,
rather painful, world of reality.

Using T. S. Eliot’s “The Waste
Land” as a basis, he went on to
explain the universal image of the
seasons. He pointed out that this
seasonal image could be related to
the cycle of the day, life, the Easter
Story, and a vast number of other
image cycles. To explain the pattern
in the Easter Story, Dr. Frye di-
vided it into three parts: 1) the
descent into Hell 2) confinement in
the Lower World 3) the return to
the Upper World. This pattern can
easily be compared with the cycle
of fall, winter and spring. Dante in
his Inferno, Vergil in parts of the
Aeneid, and Eliot in “The Waste
Land” all use basically this image
structure.

Frye further pointed out that cor-
responding the image of the descent
into Hades is the image of an ascent
into Heaven. This commonly visu-
alized as either an ascent up spiral-
ing stairs into the sky or an ascent
up a mountain to the Eden paradise
at the top. Both Yeats and Eliot
use these images frequently; this
fact is extremely important in that
these two modern poets of widely
different philosophies use generally
the same image structure.

The critic went on to give sev-
eral other basic image structures,
especially those found in Blake
and Stevens, of modern poetry.
At the conclusion of the lecture
there was a short break and then
a question period followed by re-
freshments,

Yesterday evening the contempor-
ary poet Robert Lowell read selec-
tions from his poetry and this eve-
ning he will give a lecture at 8:15
in the Troubadour Theatre. Earlier
this week Richard Eberhart gave
a poetry reading and lecture also;
both of these seminars were part of
the Glasgow Lecture Series now in
progress.

This coming Monday and Tuesday
nights Howard Nemerov, poet in
residence at Hollins College, will
give a poetry reading on the first
night and a discussion of “Bottom’s
Dream” the next evening.

Cagers Open Season Tonight Against LVC

New Height,
S spell Trouble

An added pinch of height may
prove to be the ingredient Washing-
ton and Lee University needs for its
first winning basketball season in six
years.

An experienced group of Gener-
als, led by forward and captain
“Bip” Fauber, opens a_ 16-game
schedule Friday against Lebanon
Valley (Pa.) College. Gametime is
8 p.m. in Doremus Gymnasium.

The Generals wound up with six
wins and 11 losses last year and
have not produced a winning sea-
son since 1956-57 when they were
20-7.

With eight lettermen and four
starters returning, W&L Coach Bob

McHenry has his eye on an im-
proved season.

“We should be definitely im-
proved,” he said. “But remember
we play a tougher schedule with
the addition of Lebanon Valley,
Pennsylvania Military, Baltimore,

and Centre.”

One CAC Foe

The Generals’ game with Centre
is their only encounter with a sister
member of the new five-team Col-
lege Athletic Conference. The con-
ference basketball crown will be de-
cided Feb. 22-23 in tournament play
at Sewanee, Tenn,

Although McHenry claims
height is still Washington and
Lee’s biggest problem, he will be
able to call on a pair of tall cen-
ters—6-4 junior Howard Martin
and 6-5 freshman Bob Spessard—
to strengthen his lineup. With
their height, Martin, from Lyn-
haven, and Spessard, from Roa-
noke, should give the Generals
an offensive boost.

“It’s lots easier to hit the post man
when he’s a couple of inches taller
than our short 6-2 centers of the
past several years,’ McHenry said.

Spessard is familiar to old time
W&L basketball followers. Spes-

sard’s father, Bob Spessard, Sr., is
one of Washington end Lee’s all-
time greats. The elder Spessard, a
giant in his time at 6-7, starred for
the Generals in the mid-1930’s, the
golden era of W&L basketball. He
was a three-time All-Southern Con-
ference selection.

Martin, Fauber and junior Tom
Supak of Virginia Beach are the
only definite starters for Friday’s
opening game. Supak, a guard
who paced the Generals in scor-
ing with a 15.1 average last year,
has moved to forward where he
and Fauber give W&L one of the
best front-line duos in Virginia.

Team speed is one of the Gener-

als’ biggest assets.
“We’re running better than ever
before,’ McHenry observed. “With

Tom Supak at forward, it’s like hav-
ing three guards on the floor, and

Soccer Ends Year 7-4-2;
Third In State Tourney

The Washington and Lee soccer
team has completed one of its most
successful campaigns in several sea-
sons, winding up with a 7-4-2 slate.

The Generals, led by co-captains
Clements and Pagano, began the sea-
son by dropping Pfeiffer 2-1.

After losing the next game to
Fort Lee, the Generals won three
straight. The string included vic-

tories over Randolph-Macon, VPI
and Lynchburg.

Duke handed W&L its second
defeat by a 6-0 score. Soon after,
however, the Generals began to
get back on their feet by tying a
strong American University team
4-4,

North Carolina State fell 6-0. An-
other W&L victory was added to
the books when the booters defeated
Guilford 3-0.

“Above all my hopes are that each
one participating in football
year will get more fun out of it
than they have on a squad before.
I also hope to get the maximum
pleasure from coaching the boys.

With these words newly appoint-
ed head coach Boyd Williams met
the situation nine years ago that
many called a “crisis.”

As a result of a scandal involv-
ing violations of the honor system
in late May of 1953, subsidized
athletics at Washington and Lee
came to a_ grinding halt. The
1954 season was to lack the power-
ful names of Maryland, Miami,
and the Volunteers of Tennessee,
and was to be replaced by a jayvee
schedule many only laughed at.
It was Boyd Williams who was
chosen to coach this first transi-
tional team that was to be the
starting point of W&L football
today.

His four years at college were
spent at Syracuse where his
crunching play at center was to
later earn him a place on the 1946
Richmond Rebels professional team,
as well as a coaching job at near-
by Randolph-Macon. In 1948 he
played with the Philadelphia Eagles.

With this background of big-time
football, as well as coaching exper-
ience at Virginia Military Institute
and the University of Richmond be-
tween 1949 and 1952, Boyd Williams
came to a Washington and Lee job
that offered nothing but a chance to
move up. He was faced with putting
back together a team that shied
away from or shrugged off, the
newly proposed schedule. His stu-

was in fact dying.

But he charged, as is his custom,

minds of the students that there

Lyles Keeps Soccer
Hope High For WGL

Joseph F. Lyles, Washington and
Lee’s soecer coach, merits particu-
lar praise for the efforts of this
year’s team.

The soccer team has turned out
its best performance since his ar-
rival in 1959 when his record was
6-3-1. When that year’s senior class
left, Lyles was faced with a re-
building program.

The following season brought a

: |5-3-1 slate which demonstrated that

Lyles was able to work well with
fewer effective men.

A 4-5 season in 1961 was the low
ebb for Joe Lyles’ bootmen. The
team was plagued with inexperi-
enced freshmen and a lack of team
spirit.

However, the 1962 team took ad-
vantage of the experience gained
the previous year, and with
advent of new formations and tac-

well balanced club. With this sea-

 

  

    
   
 

 
 
  

son’s 7-4-1 record Lyles has a
four-year cumulative record of
22-15-3.

prominently in W&L’s plans, has
been sick and will not see too much

The shining light of the W&L

Henry's most accurate shooter. He
is the 1962-63 team captain.

Year Of ‘Exploration’ Urged

For Freshmen Students

(Continued from page 2)

| titude and spirit on the part of the
| students. In most part, I agree with

this. (But let us not overlook the
mutual and overlapping responsibi-
lities.) Probably the only practical
place to begin instilling a_ spirit
of intellectual quest discovery is
in the freshman. All the others are
already too much reconciled with
what they have gotten themselves
into to care one way or another. Thus
my emphasis on the program of the
freshman year. Here the work must
begin.

And so to my proposal, not an
original one by any means, but one
which deserves consideration and
serious consideration,

I suggest an experiment which
would make any later reforms more
meaningful. It is proposed to make
the freshman year an exploration.
Rather than hurl the new students
up against a variety of choices and
courses, an effort should be made
to help them discover who they
are and in what ways they might
realize themselves. There is a good
example of this type of program
at Harvard. Instituted by Professor

 

, David Riesman (ironie?), it enables

freshmen to register in a seminar
their first year. This seminar can
be evaluated as a year-long bull-ses-
sion. frequently provoked by visi-
tors from outside, which hopefully
leads to concentration on fields of
interest and specific reading and
reports. It cuts through department-
al barriers and brings together
meaningfully many aspects of the
academic community. Individual re-
search and study are encouraged
as being highly desirable facets of
the education process. The program
stimulates students to question the
college’s purposes, strengths, weak-
nesses as well as their own. Would
not this be more beneficial than
the typical freshman “orientation”
to collge life?

There it is, short and brief, and,
there I am sure, is where it will stay.
We have no time for academic ex-
periments. Only what has been tried
and proven true and reliable in the
past will be trusted. Let someone
else try it however; and if it should
work well for for ten or fifteen
years, then perhaps we will investi-
gate its possibilities.
