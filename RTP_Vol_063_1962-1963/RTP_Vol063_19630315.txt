Election of the two men_ took
place yesterday afternoon. Both
have worked on the Calyx staff for
three years.

Butler was opposed for the editor-
ship by Bill Bowen, but Turner was
the only candidate for the position
of business manager. The choice be-
tween Butler and Bowen was made
on the basis of originality and
merit of their plans for the annual
next year, and on ability and ex-

Each of the candidates gave a de-

eleet Butler proposed the tentative
theme of next year’s Calyx being
centered around the liberal arts
education one of the central pur-
poses of which is the development
of gentlemen.

Butler described the theme as
being a literary one dealing with
the development of this liberal arts
education theme.

Included in his plans were reso-
lutions to cut the yearbook’s ex-
penses, the possibility of adding
more color photographs, and the de-
velopment of picture themes with
more originality and color.

he has a 1.7 overall grade ratio.

Election Close

Paine, speaking for the Publica-
tions Board, sad that “the choice
between Bowen and Butler was
very difficult to make.” Voting for

the editorship was close, he said.

At the Monday afternoon meeting
the Board also heard Tain Tomp-
kins’ presentation for the editor-
ship of the Southern Collegian.
Tompkins submitted his application
early because he will be out of town
at the date when Collegian and
Ring-tum Phi elections are normal-

The publications Board will meet
in mid-April to consider applica-
tions for business managers and edi-
tors of the Collegian and the Ring-

Calyx elections are held early so
that each editor-elect will be able
to plan the yearbook layout with
Lynchburg publishers the same
spring he is elected.

The motion to give the Assimila-

At last night’s meeting Bill Noell,

ions to the Assimilation Commit-
ee which have taken the form of
iolation of tradition and criticism
neluding letters to the editor of the

In the discussion, Tim
resident of the student body, called
he existence of the Assimilation
Sommittee “a definite infringement”

yointed out that it is no more an
nfringement on freedom than are

Lecture optic:

‘Rabbit, Run’

James Boatwright, Instructor of
English, will present a lecture on
John Updike’s Rabbit, Run, in the
Student Union building tonight.

The lecture is sponsored by the
Washington Literary Society and is
scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. Boat-
wright’s talk will concern ambiguity
in Rabbit, Run, a difficulty many
readers have found in the best-
selling novel.

The basic ambiguity, says Boat-
wright, is that the novel’s protagon-
Rabbit Angstrom, is presented
as a sympathetic character but does
things normally expected of a villain.

Can't Stop Running

Rabbit is a confused dreamer who
deserts and returns to his wife sev-
eral times during the course of the
story. Each time he leaves his wife
he goes to live with a_ prostitute.
In the end Rabbit also runs away
from the prostitute, as unable
finally to cope with life as he was
at the outset.

In his lecture tonight Boatwright
will first talk on the general sub-
ject of ambiguity in fiction, and
then move on to the novel. He hopes,
he says, to clear up some unintended
ambiguities in the story.

Rabbit, Run is Updyke’s second
novel, and has lately been followed
by a third success, Centaur, Up-
dike has also published two books of

 

 

short stories and a book of poems.

tive writing course offered by Washington

*and Lee’s English department, he
will work closely with students in-
terested in writing careers. He also
will give occasional lectures be-
fore students, faculty and the gen-
eral public.

Announcement of Humphrey's ap-
pointment was made by Dr. Arthur
R. Borden, Jr., professor of English
and chairman of the Glasgow En-
dowment Committee which sponsors
the visiting professorship. The Glas-
gow program was initiated under a
bequest from the late Arthur Gra-
ham Glasgow, whose will specified
that income from his gift was to
be used “to promote the art of ex-
pression by pen and tongue, includ-
ing voice production and delivery.”
The gift is known as the “Arthur
and Margaret Glasgow Endowment.”

The endowment’s donor was a
brother of Ellen Glasgow, Virginia
novelist. His father, Francis T.
Glasgow, was a graduate of Wash-
ington College, as Washington and
Lee was known in 1849.

Humphrey, a native of Texas, was
born in 1924. He taught at Bard Col-
lege for eight years. His first book,
a collection of short stories, was en-
titled The Last Husband and Other
Stories and appeared in 1953. His
first novel, Home from the Hill,
was published in 1958 by Knopf.
Subsequently, the novel was made
into a successful movie.

Since early 1961, Humphrey and
his wife, who make their permanent
home in Massachusetts, have been
living in Europe. He has been work-
ing on a new novel.

‘Too Much Emphasis’

Several letters and editorials have

° e e ° — :
Assimilation Committee 2st ka

There can be little doubt that the Executive Committee’s
afirmation of support for the Assimilation Committee last
night does express the convictions of the vast majority of
Washington and Lee students. In spite of a recognizable
trend toward the casual (and the sloppy) all over the United
States, the tradition of conventional dress is too valuable to
WL to be abandoned or even weakened. And the Assimila-
tion Committee is doing its job too well to be swept aside at the
behest of young philosophers and outraged individualists,

whose philosophy consists of

individuality consists of not wearing socks, and who are far
less valuable to Washington and Lee than the tradition they

flout.

These few have asked for abolition of the Assimilation
that it is an infringement on
their freedom; but they have missed the issue. The issue is not
freedom vs. forced conformity—to argue this is to quibble

Committee because they feel

over terms. The issue is the

dress. If conventional dress is a tradition worth keeping, and
the majority of students believe it is, then there ought to
be no serious objections to the existence of a small group with
which can be entrusted the continuation of the tradition. This,
the continuation of the tradition, is the only purpose of the
Assimilation Committee; it in no way, in its duty, member-
bership, or performance, resembles a Gestapo organization,
as has been intimated by a fringe of students. The Assimilation
Committee intends no violence to individuals’ freedom; it
works with an idea to create an atmosphere that should be
indicative of the students’ well-placed pride in the university.

tions’ in general, with both sides.
making what appears to be the same
mistake—that of magnifying the im-
portance of such things far out of
proportion, thus giving the casual
observer a distorted view of the
role they play in Washington and
Lee life in general.

My own views on the particular
controversy under discussion—that
of conventional dress and the As-
similation Committee—is of course,
with those who oppose the arbitrary
enforcement of the conventional
dress requirement. As far as Tam
concerned, it makes absolutely no
difference what students wear,
either to class or in the town itself,
and I would be in complete sympa-_
thy with a movement to abolish both >
the Assimilation Committee and)
conventional dress itself, simply be-
cause of the false emphasis such a
rule places on appearance and super- |
ficiality.

‘Emphasis on Superficiality’

At the same time, however, those |
who take this position seem to be
undermining the very thing they're,
trying to destroy by placing empha-_
sis where they do; such violent op-
position has been encountered in)
many quarters does nothing but re-
inforce the opinions of those who
favor the present arrangement, and
the whole tenor of the controversy
thus created places an unnecessary
emphasis on the very superficiality
it seeks to oppose. Furthermore,

New Trend in Films Noted

By TOM PACE

In the past week I have seen five
films—“Days of Wine and Roses,’
“Splendor in the Grass,” “Shoot the
Piano Player,” “Roman Holiday,”
and “The Hook”—all of which, in
some manner or other, were worth-
while.

However, one of these, “Shoot the
Piano Player,” was considerably
superior to the others. There are
good reasons for its superiority;
these reasons should help point out
not only significant integrants in a
quality film, but also a significant
trend in the current cinema.

Franeois Truffaut, the director,
wrote the screenplay himself. He
was admitted, therefore, to an inti-
mate knowledge of the plot and its
characters. By his writing the
screenplay, the film became more
closely, solely his work; thereby
reinforcing his ego and evidently,
his efforts.

Ordinary Story, Unusual Film

It is a simple story with common
elements. Yet where the story is
ordinary, the film is not. Truffaut's
treatment lifts it up for praise.

For example, you have his charac-
ters. His hero is a saloon piano
player. He is a weak and timid man.
Yet he is an attractive character. He
has good humor, with an odd but
effective mixture of the comic and
the sad.

You can laugh with and at him.
You can fall for and with him.

The gangsters seem completely
unlike gansters. They are funny and
human and always enjoyable.

Truffaut’s female characters—save
the young prostitute—although they
are often lovable, nonetheless usually
possess enough bitchiness to keep
the males in a more favorable light.

Characters ‘Always Plus’

My reaction to his characters was
always plus. I enjoyed seeing gangs-
ters being good fellows. I thought
it was time that some man showed
that all women have a little bitch
in them. And I liked having a hero
who was sympathetic for all the
wrong reasons.

The most remarkable part of the
film was Trauffaut’s technique. He
possesses a style. Many parts make
up the whole of his style.

There is the amazing pace of the

seem to be many things which have
a much more immediate importance
than whether or not to wear a coat
or tie.

A far greater danger appears to
be present, however, in the writings
of those who resist any constructive
evaluation of the role of the so-
ealled “traditions” at Washington
and Lee; this consists of linking
Washington and Lee with its “tradi-|
tions” to such an extent that one
sees no value in Washington and Lee
apart from things like conventional
dress.

In Spite of ‘Traditions’

This danger is most evident in
those statements which attempt to
show that, without, for example,
conventional dress, Washington and
Lee would be “just like any other
school,” thus implying that the only
thing which makes W&L a distinc-
tive institution of higher learning is
the presence of the so-called “tra-
ditions,” of which conventional dress
is the most notorious example,
Speeking for myself, I must admit
that I have remained at Washington
and Lee in spite of such traditions,
rather than because of them, and
certainly do not consider them to be
an integral part of anything which

action—so rapid that I find it un-
paralleled in recent viewing; there
is the always moving camera, rarely
remaining in one position for more
than five or six minutes; there is the
constant use of the close-up that
somehow is never jarring and there
is neo-realism, his use of shock.

There preceding paragraphs lead
to a generalization about this “new
trend” in films.

A Return to the Visual

Films are becoming more visual.
Emotion, impact, interest, inudument
all have become more dependent on
what is seen, how the camera is:
used.

The cinema is becoming cinema.
again. when dialogue becomes only
an ordinary part of a film, when it
no longer must carry the movie, then
the cinema is approaching its natur-
al state. Characters are more ef-
fective now; not the stock gangster,
cowboy, or lover .

They are original and different,
and they are more real. In addi-
tion, the film has become the di-

Or Rules?

Fuliermore, it should be pointed
owt thet much of the confusion
peers to be caused by a misunder-
standing of the nature of tradition
itself. Judging from my own obser-
vations of the past four years, it
would appear that such things as
excessive drunkenness and “dump-
ing on your date” are traditions with
just as much, if not more importance
as the Honor System and the “speak-
ing tradition”; the more or less sys-
tematic opposition to conventional
dress which arises each year Is just
as much a tradition as is conven-
tional dress itself. It appears, there-
fore, somewhat dishonest to pick out
those “traditions” which look good
and place them before the public as
the image of Washington and Lee,

ap-

savory aspects which can also be
called “traditional” in every sense
of the word.
Tradition Must Be ‘Spontaneous’
A so-called “tradition,’ in order
to be a tradition, must arise spon-
taneously from the feelings of the

| student body as a whole; it cannot
be arbitrarily imposed by fiat. For

this reason, the presence of devia-
tion from an established pattern may
well be a sign that a tradition does
indeed exist, simply because of the
indication that obedience to the so-
ealled “tradition” is voluntary, rather
than enforced.

A respect for the past is both
healthy and necessary ,especially in
today’s radically changing world.
At the same time, however, accept-
ing the past merely because it is
the past is just as bad as advocating
change for the sake of change. Any
tradition which is worthy of the
name cannot help but be enriched

Letters
To The
Editor...

To the Editor:

Sitting in the Commons, I recently
caught myself in a not too uncom-
mon discussion on the University
and its traditions.

The usual banter about striped ties
do not a prison make nor ironed
shirts a cage arose along with what
Falstaff and the E.C. might con-
sider honor.

And yet, to quote from our mime-
ographed alma mater, I suddenly
realized that this was all I had been
doing since the beginning of this,
my freshman year. And to witness
from the articles in the Ring-tum
Phi, my contact with independent
and even some fraternity upperclass-
men, and such publications as “Pro-
test,” this is apparently all a great-
er portion of the student body finds
significant with the University.

Rabbit, Run to W&L Literary Society (see story page 1).

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

In the past two weeks, this paper
has printed unceasing attacks by
irate students against the Slater
Food Management Service. A furth-
er exposee is rather like kicking the
corpse or waving the bloody shirt
(and most freshmen will swear that
the shrimp creole is bloody shirt
a la king).

But there is yet one unrevealed
atrocity which all last minute break-
fasters are familiar...an atrocity
which surpasses in callousness all
that has been heretofore exposed to
public scrunity. This atrocity is
Slater’s regular custom of running
out of food at the stroke of 8:15, just
when the eat-it-in-five-minutes-or-
be-late-to-class diners dash in. What
transpires at these frequent and
tragic catastrophes usually goes like
this:

Palace of Culinary Delights

8:14—Famished student enters the
Slater Food Palace of Culinary De-
lights, having eleven minutes to
stuff himself and make it to the re-
mote extremities of the campus for
his 8:25 Chemistry class.

8:14.25—Student reaches the line
line and catches his first tantaliz-
ing whiff of prune juice, burnt toast,
and Slater’s unique clotting syrup.

8:14.5—His stomach beginning to
growl, the student grabs a tray and
plunges into the depths of the for-
bidden interior of Slaterdom, the
food line.

Quaint Yellow Lard

8:14,75—Student reaches the height
of anticipation at the prospect of

 

 

 

Chamber Of Horrors:
Commons At 8 A.M.

Slater’s moth-watering waffles, cov-
ered with the quaint yellow lard
that passes for butter and the unique
clotting syrup.

8:15—-The kitchen runs out of the
mouth-watering waffles. Not only
does Slater run out of mouth-water-
ing waffles, they run out of the
waffiles that they serve too.

8:16—Drooling by now, the student
feels the first twinges of resentment
at having been denied a minute of
eating time. The Slater people be-
gin to chat with each other.

Waiting ... Waiting ... Waiting
8:17—His wrath mounting steadily
the student asks, “How much longer
‘til you'll have some more food?”

“Huh? Whazzat?” the nearest den-
izen of the scullery blurts out.

“TI say when will there be some
more waffles?”

“Oh, we're out of waffles! Fancy
that!” And with this revelation, the
white-uniformed server waddles
down to the far reaches of the kitch-
en where the goodies are manufac-
tured. She is seen mumbling some-
thing te the pudgy man in the tall
chef’s hat. (And incidentally, it is
fantastie how much this particular
individual presumes in wearing a
chef’s hat).

Juice and Curdied Milk
8:18—Chef pours batter into wafile
cookers. Student downs glasses of
milk and grapefruit juice simul-
taneously to ally his hunger and is
rewarded by a gurgling feeling in
the pit of his stomach as the milk

THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE

 

Revolution

By ED NORTON
In the always volatile Middle East,
revolution has reached epidemic pro-
portions. Since last September, coups

proclaimed their friendship for the
Egyptian president .Both of the coups
in Iraq and Syria were the work of
the Ba’ath (Arab Awakening)

 

have toppled three regimes and have
virtually reversed the situation in
the Arab world from what it was
six months ago.

From Yemen, the remote primi-
tive country tucked on the south-
west corner of the Arabian penin-
sula, came the word last September
28 that the centuries old dynasty of
the Iman had fallen. Colonel Ab-
dulla Sala, leader of the coup, pro-
claimed a “republic” which ever
sinee has owed its existence to the
presence of Egyptian troops sent by
Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of
the United Arab Republic. On Feb-
ruary 8 Iraqi army officers ended the
four year dictatorship of Abdul
Karim Kassem. And on March 8
a military coup toppled the govern-
ment in Syria.

Cemmon Elements

Each of these revolutions seems to
have a great deal in common. In
each case, the army overthrew
regimes hostile to Nasser and in-

 

stalled governments which quickly

Party—a_ socialist organization de-
voted to the idea of Arab unity. The
basie ideology of the Ba’ath is that
“there are no Arab nations; there is
only one Arab nation.” And_ this
same is warmly supported by Presi-
dent Nasser.

The new governments in Syra,
Iraq, and Yemen share other ideals
which will tend to draw them closer
together and closer to Cairo. They
desire to remain neutral in the con-
flict between East and West and are
hostile to Communist and Western
attempts to exert internal political
influence. Primarily socialist in eco-
nomic policy, these governments are
seeking badly needed modernization
and social reform. And they are de-
voted to the “liberation” of other
Arab nations which they consider to
be backward regimes, barriers to
Arab unity, and tools of foreign in-
terest. The monarchies in Jordan
and Saudi Arabia are the prime ex-
amples of such nations. This Nas-
ser’s dream of Arab unity which was

 

rudely shattered when Syria broke
away from the United Arab Re-
public in 1961 now may have a very
real chance of reaching some frui-
tion.

Barriers to Unity

However, there are still serious
barriers to Arab unity, or at least
Arab unity dominated by Gamal
Abdel Nasser. Almost the entire
Arab world has gained national
sovereignty, and only the fringes of
the Arabian peninsula remain under
direct foreign control. With this in-
dependence, the emphasis of Arab
polities has shifted away from na-
tionalism to problems of internal re-
form. But reform and unity may be
difficult to reconcile, especially in
the light of the differences between
the Arab nations.

Regional Differences

Yemen, for example, is one of the
most backward countries in the
world, and in many respects has
just begun to emerge from centuries
of feudalism. Syria and Iraq, with
educated, politically-active classes
and semi-capitalist economies, have
reached a stage of much higher de-

velopment and their problems will
be different from those of Yemen.
Syria, which depends heavily on
capitalist free enterprise may run
into conflict with primarily socialist
Egypt. Racial and religious differ-
ences, even in a predominately mus-
lim world, hinder any attempts at
close unity within the Arab world.
In Iraq particularly, the Kurdish
community has demanded some form
of autonomous self rule.

Entente, but not Union

It is not likely, moreover, that the
governments of Iraq and Syria will
be eager to place themselves under
the control of Nasser. The Ba’athist
leaders seem to have reshaped their
idea of Arab unity around a loose
federation of Arab states without
any centralized control. Salah Bitar,
Premier of Syria, indicating that
such a poliey would be followed by
his government, has said, “We will
proceed to new entente with
Egypt, but not union.”

a

More Conflict to Come
The revolution in Syria is not like-
ly to be the last that will shake the
Middle East, and in many ways the

 

 

in the East: A Move Toward Arab Unity

situation may be more unstable than
it was six months ago. King Hussein
of Jordan is under increasing pres-
sure and there have been reports
of a Ba’athist, pro-Nasser plot to
depose him. Fearing that Hussein’s
overthrow would bring Egyptian
forees into Jordan, Isreali Prime
minister David Ben Gurion warned,
“If Hussein falls, it will mean war.”
For then Isreal will be surrounded
by Arab states dedicated to its de-
struction. And Nasser’s forces in
Yemen have been charged with at-
tacking Arabian towns just across
the border, creating the danger of
conflict between Egypt and Saudi
Arabia.
The U.S. Policy

The United States has generally
greeted the recent nationalist revo-
lutions hopefully, recognizing that a
united Middle East is the best de-
fense against Communism _infiltra-
tion in this vital area. But we have
also made it plain to Nasser that
this eountry will not telerate any
military adventures into either Jor-
dan or Saudi Arabia. We will sup-
port Arab nationalism, but not at
the risk of war in the Middle East.

This will be a familiar scene Tuesday when W&L opens its lacrosse season.

ust Like Old Times: McHenry
Searches For Lacrosse Goalie

For the second straight year

Washington and Lee University’s la-|
is|

erosse coach Bobby McHenry
frantically searching for a goalie.

The season’s opener with Swarth-
more College (here March 26) is less
than a week away and the Generals
still do not have a tested hand in
the goal.

McHenry has switched sophomore
Butch West from midfield to goal in
hopes of solving the Generals’ most
pressing problem.

If lightning strikes twice in the
same place, McHenry might come up
with another All-American goalie.
Last year he put attackman Ray
Miller of Baltimore into the goal and

 

Outfield Weak

Good Pitching May Help W&L
Improve Baseball Record

If good pitching breeds success in baseball, then Coach
Joe Lyles’ Washington and Lee club should be well on its

way to an improved season.

The Generals struggled to a poor*

1-11-1 record last year, but were
plagued with pitching troubles all
season.

This year Lyles welcomed six
pitchers, all of whom show promise.
Good Pitching
Heading the staff are returnees
Mason MeGowin, Brice Gamber,
Chris Wigert, and Louie Paterno.
These four plus a pair of freshmen—
Charles Clement and Sam Simpson—
should make quite a formidable

hurling corps.

Outfield is the big problem right
now. The Generals are very inex-
perienced in the garden, having lost
all three of their 1962 starters to
graduation.

Five Returnees

Captain Chuck Lane, Buck Rose,
Paterno, Howard Martin, and Lou
Flanagan return to infield spots.
These together with several prom-
ising freshmen are giving the Gen-
erals a slick-looking infield.

Catching seems to be the least
of Lyles’ worries. Experienced mit-
man Ashley Allen is returning and
Lyles can also call on a pair of
promising freshmen prospects in
Pete Hendricks and David Red-
mond.

Miller proceded to become a second
team All-American at that position.
West, another Baltimore product,
has looked good so far in kicking out
shots.
Attack Questionable

The Generals’ attack is another
question mark. Experienced soph-
omores Carroll Klingelhofer and Bob
Hankey and midfielder turned at-
tackman Randy Wootton will have
to carry the burden of the W&L of-
fense.

What attack the Generals have is
fair to good, but the trouble is
there’s not enough of it.

Midfield Strong

A strong group of midfielders
should considerably brighten W&L’s
chances of improving last year’s 1-11
record.

John McDaniels, who McHenry
tabs as one of the top lacrosse pros-
pects that W&L has had in many
years, Steve Stull, and Eben War-
ner rate as the top midfielders.

For the first time in four or five
years, the Generals boast numbers
at midfield.

“We have 15 midfielders right
now,” McHenry said. “This should
help us to improve.”

‘Track Team
Faces Mounts

| Wednesday

Mount St. Mary’s College, one of
the stronger members of the Mason-
Dixon Conference, will give the
W&L track teem its final warm-up
test Wednesday night at VMI.

"he

Generals, who whipped
Bridzewater College, 60-52, in an-
other warm-up indoor meet two
weeks ago, face Mount St. Mary’s
in their final preparation for the
opening of the spring track season,
Prid y, March 29, against Old Do-
minion College at Norfolk.

Tough Foe
Mt. St. Mary's, which finished

fourth in the Mason-Dixon chum-
pionships last spring behind Ro»-
noke, American University, and
Gallaudet, will offer the Generals a
sincere threat.

Tocir top performances include
9.9 in the 100, 22.6 in the 220, 1:58.7
in the 880, 16.3 in the high hurdles,
25.4 in the low hurdles, and 22-10'2
in the broad jump.

Washington and Le’s track squad,
67 strong, is shooting for its fourth
straight good season. For the last
three years, the Generals have a
20-1 dual meet record. Only Wake
Forest, which topped the Generals,
69-62, last year, has marred a_ per-
fect record.

25 Veterans

Twenty-five veterans and a_ host
of freshmen are combining to form
a team of real promise.

Headed by co-captains Dave Mun-
roe in the shot put and Mickey

boast good depth in every event
but two—the high jump and the
pole vault.

Junior Robin Kell stands alone
as the best in the high jump and
hop-step, and jump. His brother, Kit,
is the Generals’ top dash man, but
he is currently sidelined with a
leg injury.

Freshman Don Casto, Scott Ken-
nedy, and Mark Owen and junior
Henry Sackett should take up the
slack in the sprints.

Distances String

count for some welcomed depth.

‘Eternal Vengeance’ For Slater

(Continued from page 2)

begins to curdle from the acidic
juice.

8:19—Reeking black fumes emit
from the Waffle cookers. Chef

judges them almost done, Student,
now suffering from the combined
pangs of hunger and indigestion, be-
gins to mutter curses under his
breath.

8:20—The first of the waffles,
roasted to a golden black, emerge
from the cookers, but the server
won't bring any of them until the
last one is plopped on the tray.
Slater believes that if you can’t
do something right, you should do
anything at all. The student mean-
while becomes desperate, noting that
he has only five minutes until class
starts.

Ah, at Last
8:21—A waffle is finally plunked
on his plate (Oh, joy!) and the

unique clotting syrup slopped on top.
Notwithstanding the fact that they
have just been cooked, the waffles
are already icy cold. Student eager-
ly snatches his plate and settles at
the nearest table.

8:22—The student picks up _ his
fork, and low and behold, there is a

tiny glob of brown goo left on

8:22.5—His stomach churns and
heaves in open rebellion as the
student rushes to the fork dish and
hunts for a clean fork.

Malnutrition, and the Mad Dash

8:22.7—-Two and a quarter minutes
until the bell! The starving student
gulps down half of the waffle,
scraping off the scum forming on
the syrup’s surface. Grabbing a piece
of toast to devour en route, he
sprints out of the palatial dining
hall and runs toward the Science
Building at his top speed. By this
time, however, it’s no use—the stu-
dent is too weakened by malnutri-
tion to run very fast. He staggers in-
to class at 8:27, two minutes late,
with a black mark recorded against
him by his cranky professor and
swearing eternal vengance on the
Slater Food Management Service and
and all its hosts.

To Slaughters

For all the rest of the day, the
hungry student will gleefully medi-
tate on boiling all the Slater people
in their own syrup. All that night,
he will have pleasant dreams of
the pudgy chef served up on a
silver platter, surrounded by herbs
and vegetables, and with a large,
red apple in his mouth.

And I, for one, can’t blame him.

Letters To The Editor .. .

 

(Continued from page 2)

Needless to say, it all leads to, if
nothing else, very boring conversa-
tions. If then, for no other reason
than to make my own stay here a
little more interesting, I began to
look around for what I considered
worthwhile activities. Of course,
what is new to me may be already
well known to others and what I
say serve simply as commendation.

There are two groups of students
who have been making regular trips
to Western State Hospital at Staun-
ton to work with the mental pa-
tients. One of the groups under
Rev. Schnieder is already filled and
has undergone considerable train-
ing and experience at the hospital.
Another similar group headed by
Dr. Hodges which will probably be
going to Staunton on week-ends

 

could use more people in its pro-
gram.

Perhaps the most exciting of all}
developments are the recent meet-
ings that the independent students |
have held. While their unification
does have political significance, far
more important than becoming a}
puppet of our seemingly impotent |
political structure, such a union can)
offer an alternative to the fraternity |
monopoly on social life. Such a!
simple thing as getting cars for!
dates might now well be arranged. |
Also, an unaffiliated non-fraternity |
group might serve as a core around |
which to build a Washington and |
Lee spirit rather than simple loyal- |
ty to this or that fraternity. |
A philosophy group is meeting in
the Student Union Lounge; discus-
sions are conducted with Hollins, |
Sweet Briar, and Randolph-Macon;
Dr. Barritt along with W&L stu-

dents pass out welfare food in Lex-
ington; and some of the churches
run very interesting programs—to
name afew more perhaps less known
happenings.

This so far has been my sphere of
interest and experience to fill the
void of Tweed Ring. Directed mainly
at students like myself who talk
of little more than transfers, I
simply state that there are many
worthwhile activities and people to
offset the humdrum life of “flick out”
and mud filled red squares.

Traditions Require Dissent
(Continued from page 2)

by constructive criticism and re-
evaluation.

It is for this reason that con-
structive and creative dissent is
absolutely nevessary in any kind of ;
free society. If conventional dress,
the “speaking tradition,’ or even
the Honor System cannot stand such
dissent, then they are certainly not
worthy of the name “tradition”;
this is, to be sure, not to undermine
their value, even when seen as
arbitrary rules. Before giving them
such an important role as “tradi- |
tions” in Washington and Lee, how- |
ever, let us first make sure that we |
have all the implications of such al
position clearly in mind.
