Magazine
Announced

‘Ariel’ Debuts in December

By SHANNON JUNG

The first issue of the 1962-
63 Ariel is to be off the press
on December 5, according to

editor John F. Refo.

In April 1962, Ariel, first W&L
student publication, was founded by
seven students as an independent
literary review written and publish-
ed without University subsidy.
The magazine originated as an all-
student crusade to publish a campus
literary paper.

Of the original seven staff editors,
only Refo as editor-in-chief, and
Bill Lowry as philosophy editor, re-
main. The other five, including Tim
Morton as drama editor, have left
school due to one circumstance or
another.

First Issue Reviewed

In the first issue the various ar-
ticles and their contributors are:

First, three critical articles on the
French “theater of the absurd:”

Philosophical Origins of the The- |

ater, written by Bill Lowry;

Dramatic Origins of the Theater,
author, Andy Adelson;

Historical Developments of the
Theater, by Frank Carlile;

Next, a journal of the First Na-
tional Poetry Festival, held at Wash-
ington October 22-24, and attended
by Refo;

A series of poems, including two
written by Chet White, Jr.;

Two book reviews:

O'Neill, reviewed by John Dunnell;

Of Long and Happy Life, by Phil
Reidforth;

And an Obituary on E. E, Cum-
mings, by Tim Morton.

The cost of the magazine which
is sold in one year subscriptions
(three issues) is $2.00. There will be
little attempt to sell Ariel in indi-
vidual issues, outside the faculty and
Hollins.

Funds Needed

Since this is solely a student ef-
fort, the eight hundred dollars need-
ed to print the three issues will have
to be raised through advertisements
and subscriptions. Refo said that the
staff has come within $125 of their
$800 goal.

“We have managed to raise $625
through ads and subscriptions up to
this point. We lack $125, but are
approaching our goal, and will need
everyone’s help, if we are to attain

Court Debaters
Reach Finals

Washington and Lee’s Moot Court
team went to the finals in regional
competition this past weekend at
Richmond before losing the last
round to the University of Virginia.

By winning a berth in the finals,
the team earned a trip to national
moot competition, which will be held
in December. The national meet is
sponsored by the Association of the
Bar of New York City.

The team representing the W&L
School of Law is made up of William
Clark, Don Partington, and Richard
Rose. Clark, a senior law student and
1960 W&L graduate, tied for best
individual argument in this week-
end’s competition. Co-holder of this
honor with Clark was Lester Cooper
of the U.Va. team.

Moot court trials are staged with
the teams arguing a_ hypothetical
case before a real judge. There is
no word as yet on the grading by
the judges of the W&L brief on
the case of the past weekend.

The team was in Richmond Fri-
day, Saturday, and Sunday for the
competition, held at the University
of Richmond Law School.

Trial Option
Unanimously
Dissapproved

The Executive Committe formally
abolished the option in regard to
honor trials in its meeting last night.
The vote was unanimous. This op-
tion is the stipulation which allows
the student to voluntarily with-
draw from the University without
coming to trial when he is faced
with an accusation of an honor of-
fense.

President Tim Ireland said that he
found student and faculty reaction
to the announcement of the EC’s
intentions in last Friday’s Ring-tum
Phi to be favorable. The Executive
Committee saw no reason for further
delay.

The new honor procedure, minus
the option, went into effect as of
last night at midnight.

 

 

Exam Proposal Endorsed
In addition to this action, the EC|
“heartily endorsed” the suggestion |
regarding a modification of the exam |
schedule as it was outlined in an|
editorial in the last Tuesday Edition. |
Editors of the Ring-tum Phi will |

Recent Glee Club Concert Praised by Local Paper

The latest appearance of the Glee Club, a concert at Clifton Forge, has
been praised effusively in the Clifton Forge Daily Review. Columnist Ted
Farrar wrote that the concert was “an unforgettable experience,” and
lauded the “disciplined character of the all male group.” The Brass Choir,
which backed the singing group, was praised for its “fine tonal quality.”
The Glee Club and Brass Choir were entertained at a reception after their

Bridgewater Wins TKA Debate Tournament Held Here

The Virginia Tau Kappa Alpha debate tournament held here last
Friday and Saturday was won by Bridgewater College as Washington and
Lee’s two-year championship team watched from the sidelines.

Bill Noell and Al Eckes, who had won the state title two years in a
row, didn’t enter this one. W&L Forensic Director W. W. Chaffin elected
to use them in directing the tournament, declining to shoot for a third
straight title because of his position as host

Three W&L teams were entered and none had a losing record. Bill
Boardman and Jay Clark, who usually combine with Noell and Eckes
to form W&L’s first team, debated the affirmative and finished with a 3-1
record. Sam Frazier and Chuck Reese, freshmen, also earned a 3-1 from
the affirmative stand. These two teams led W&L and each received a
certificate of excellence.

In the business meeting of the organization, Bill Boardman stepped
down as president, and Russell Warren of Richmond was elected the
new president. Bill Noell was elected regional representative to the na-
tional TKA governing body.

Randolph Macon and Richmond placed second and third in the tourn
ment.

The Generals, who cruised to their
26th victory in 28 games over a
four-year span, sparkled as_ they

completely outmaneuvered the Lynx
in the muddy battle.

Five interceptions by the Generals’
alert defense wrecked the Lynx of-

W&L tallies.

Halfback flash Stu Yoffe pick-
ed off a Bert Chafin pass at the
Washington and Lee 15 and dashed

Yoffe was not through, however.

Chuck Lane, who turned in _ his

around right end.

SATURDAY’S
STATISTICS

Washington and Lee’s 8-1 grid
mark of this season has tipped the
university’s all-time record in
favor of the winning side for the
first time since 1955. W&L’s in-
tercollegiate football figures since
1890 now read 246-244-30,

It took three successive seasons
of play with only one loss, to
bring the W&L record up from
the depths of the lean 50’s. Last
year’s perfect slate, however, was
enough to put Coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin’s W&L record above .500.
After this season, his sixth, Mc-
Laughlin has a comfortable 29-
20-2 mark.

The Generals’ record dipped
under the .500 point in 1955 for the
first time since the early 1900's, as
they went through the entire sea-
son without winning a game.

McLaughlin went through sea-
sons records of 0-8, 1-7, and 3-4-1,
before the 1960 season.

 

 

Linebacker Mike Sheffey launched
the second General TD drive when
he intercepted a Chafin pass at the
W&L 48 and churned to the South-
western. 45.

After a 15-yard clipping penalty
set the Generals back to their 40,
Keesee reeled 14 yards in three
carries, Skip Chase raced for seven,
and Yoffe picked up one to the
Lynx 38.

Laurels for the Generals

Washington and Lee’s football team finished its season
Saturday by topping Southwestern, 22-0. The win gave the
Generals an 8-1 record, excellent by all standards, and also
brought home the first College Athletic Conference football

title.

It would be a mistake to say that, because the Generals

play ‘“‘amateur”’ ball, they do
the records clearly prove. But

not play to win. They do, as
an excellent record, or even a

CAC title, is not the team’s most signficant accomplishment.
The football team’s accomplishment lies in the fact that
our brand of play has proved successful, and that this success
reficts the ideals of the entire University. In other words, foot-
ball teams here do more than win: they make a significant and

worthwhile contribution to the

W&L “image.”

The coaches, captains, and members of this year’s team
deserve more praise than we can possibly bestow. They have
played football the way it should be played, not as a business

but as a game, and they have

played it well, to say the least.

And wherever they have played they have done more than
win games: they have won friends and admiration for Wash-

ington and Lee.

Quality Speakers

The announcement last week of the Glasgow Speakers
moves us to comment on the exceptional quality of extra-cur-
ricular lectures which have been held on the campus recently.

Certainly poets Eberhart, Lowell and Nemerov will offer
a valuable contribution to the intellectual life of the University;

and they are only the latest in

what appears to be a trend to-

wards more stimulating seminars. A number of noteworthy
men in various fields, including psychologist-theologist O. H.
Mowrer and academician Russell Kirk, have visited and
lectured here this year. Northrop Frye, considered by many to

be the foremost literary critic
appear in conjunction with the

of our times, is scheduled to
Glasgow series.

The student body has long been voicing loud demands
for “bigger and better” seminar programs. Now it is getting
them, and we trust student response will justify the time and
energy which has been spent on bringing these men to Wash-

ington and Lee.

‘The Needy Are Costly’

 

‘Survival Of The Fittest’
Set Above Social Welfare

By JOHN KIRKLEY
“How is man to be preserved best,
longest, most agreeably?” This is a
very important question to most
thinking men today. Of course, one
of our greatest problems is that of
mere survival; but, beyond that, are
other hopes of making life easier,
more productive, more enjoyable.
And it can be said that the West-
ern nations, and the United States
in particular, have been incredibly
successful in fulfilling many of the
material desires of Man.
High Living Standard
The average per capita income in

the United States is around $2,700
as compared to about $50 in Burma
or other undeveloped countries. Our
standard of living is the highest in
the world. More people live longer,
healthier, more (materially) produc-
tive lives with less effort than ever
before.

Through automation, technology,
medicine, and social welfare these
advances have been made possible.
Lives today can be essentially de-
void of pain, suffering, involvment
in creative work: emotionally ster-
ile.

BEHIND THE NEWS

 

 

Leon Bibb, the virtually unkown
Negro folk singer who became a
sensation of last year’s Fancy Dress,
has been making the rounds of
area girls schools.

A week ago he appeared at Sweet
Briar, and sang again this past
wekend at Randolph-Macon in
Lynchburg. Reports indicated that
while the crowds were large and
enthusiastic, Bibb’s receptions at
the two schools didn’t match his
appeal at W&L last year.

* * *

Washington and Lee’s gentlemen
are fairing badly on road trips.

Several fraternities—at least
three—have been “blacklisted” at
two girls’ colleges in the region, and
one of the girls’ schools called a
special meeting of its freshmen to
discuss the “special problem of dat-
ing at Washington and Lee.”

The Romance languages depart-
ment has revealed plans to estab-

 

 

 

lish a language laboratory in one
of the downstairs classrooms in
duPont Hall.

According to Dr. James S. Patty,
associate professor of Romance
languages, it will be the first lan-
guage lab for the department.

There is at present a “very small”
lab under the jurisdiction of the
Russian department and available
to the German department, Patty
said,

Rumor has it that this year’s Fancy
Dress theme of the “Old South” may
have a special twist to it.

There is a_ possibility that the

peared in last Friday’s R-t P as
the “New Fancy Dress Symbol”
will materialize right out of the
pages of Playboy.

Letters
To The
Editor...

 

 

 

Student Criticizes
EC Option Rule

Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:
I feel rather helpless as I write my

opinion on the E.C. proposal to
abolish the “option.” For although
I must concede to it just and

benevolent allowance of free speech
and opinion, they have made it
quite clear that this is only a formal
recognition of student rights and
will have little bearing upon the
decision of its judicial hierarchy.

Henry Ford once stated that you
could have a Ford in any color you
wished; so long as that color was
black. None the less, I feel com-
pelled to leap at the opportunity of
voicing my opinion even if my
voice be inaudible.

Keep the Option

Don’t abolish the option! The E. C.
says that the abolition of the option
is to protect the student. Why? Be-
cause it insures a fair trial to a
student who may be ignorant of, |
or may misunderstand the Honor |
System trial procedures.

When the E. C. admits that the
clarity of their procedure is ques-
tionable to the student body, it
seems ridiculous to abolish a policy
which in no way will lend to us a
clearer picture of E. C. procedure.

Wouldn’t it be wiser first, more
logical and more just, to try to
clarify in the minds of the students
exactly what to expect from an
E. C. trial? Why destroy the option
when this can in no way clarify
the misunderstanding?

The E. C. has secondly stated that
they often have to persuade a boy,
whose case is doubtful, to stand trial.
This seems to me as far as one can
go. For after the procedure and
conditions of the case have been
clarified, the boy must be aware
of his innocence or guilt under the
Honor System.

Why Force Trial?

Thus, why should a boy who is
guilty be forced to go through the
ordeal of a trial? It may not com-
ply with the judicial minds at W&L,
but the option has a certain human-
itarian aspect of decency which I
think it well to preserve.

The E. C. knows no degree of
guilt or innocence—the law is the
law. All this is well and good, but
the student still has his degree of
guilt, he lives with it, and it is an
intricate part of his character. And
the option is a way of releasing
himself from the fruitless struggle
to validate his degree of guilt and
to preserve that degree which is
innate in his character, to a system
which recognizes no degrees.

E. C. Trying Conscience?

It seems impossible that the E. C.
can actually propose to place on
trial human conscience. The trial
questions actions, not conscience.
Taking the option means that the
| individual is incapable or unwilling
| to comply with the Honor System.
| And this, I think, is the question. In
|a situation of degree of guilt, of
, conscience, innocence or guilts plays
little part.

 

The Honor System is a way of life.
It is an ideal and a principle which
should not be degraded by tyranny
or undue harshness. It would seem
to me that the E. C.’s job is not only
to judge innocence and guilt, but
it is to insure the safety and happi-
ness of the student. Thus when a
student’s basic character is unfit or
incapable of upholding the ideal of
the Honor System he should be given
the right to abandon it—and the
school which stands by it—as pro-
vided under the option.

Honor Is Subjective

Are we at W&L so base, so un-
just, so intolerant as not to respect
the conscience of others? If Wash-
ington and Lee is a society of peo-
ple attempting to live in harmony
together, it matters litle whether or
not the conconforming student es-
capes the formality of a trial “con-
viction.”

The Honor System is more than
the laws of Hammurabi; there
should be no laws, ideally, for hon-
or is a totally personal, subjective

Refutes Immorality Charge

 

 

The ‘Humor of Hairy’ Defended

By Ex-Collegian Editor Paine

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor

In 1595, Sir Philip Sidney wrote
a “Defence of Poetry,’ an essay
which defended English poetry and
drama against charges that these two
arts were “immoral.” The attack had
come from a man named Stephen
Gossen, and in his treatise entitled
“School of Abuse,” he had directed
a withering attack on poetry, calling
it a corrupter of English morality.

In 1962, in the Friday Edition of
The Ring-tum Phi, H. F. Day wrote
a letter which attacked The South-
ern Collegian as being immoral. He
charged that the magazine lacks
originality, sophistication, and uni-
versality. By this last item, Mr.
Day appears to have meant that The
Southern Collegian centers too much
on the local scene, and thus could
not be appreciated by anyone not a
member of this student body In that
I am a past editor of The Southern
Collegian, I feel qualified to answer
Mr. Day and his criticisms.

In defense of the most recent
edition, I would say that the so-
called “sick jokes” used in the last
issue were not well-received, and
will probably not be used again. It
should be noted that although this
past issue did not come out until
November 10, all copy was in for it
by October 10 in the original effort
to get the issue out by Openings.
In other words, there were less than
two weeks from the end of Rush
Week for the staff to compile the
entire issue.

A Look at Last Year

I would like at this point to re-
view Mr. Day’s criticisms in light
of last year’s four issues, which
were published under my editorishp.
The trend followed last year, with
a few new innovations, is that which
George Honts, new Collegian editor,
plans to follow in the next three
issues.

On Mr. Day’s charge of lack of
originality, I would say that very
few old jokes, and only two old

 

ideas, were used in the Collegian
all last year. I think that the un-
truth of Mr. Day’s statement will
be best shown in my defence against
his next two charges, namely lack of
sophistication, and lack of univer-
sality.

In the Openings Issue last year,
only one out of ten articles was
even confined in subject to the collge
campus in general. It was not con-
fined to W&L specifically. The other
articles used nine out of ten most
common forms of humor in the
world today, including slapstick, ob-
scenity, jokes, sarcasm, exaggera-
tion, understatement, word-play,
irony and satire.

In a special “Civil War Centen-
nial” section, the entire cult of
Civil-War worshippers was satirized
on a universal level. There was a
satire on an advice column to
lonely lovers, and a classical fable
with a moral punch. The jokes were
applauded at that time as_ being
original and funny.

Universality of Collegian

In the next issue, released at
Fancy Dress, the magazine included
eleven features (not counting a
large number of cartoons and jokes),
with only two articles relating at
all to college, and only one center-
ing around W&L students. There
was a parody on The Ladies Home
Journal, and some of the best writ-
ing I have seen was included in
some animal fables written by Sam
Thomas. These stories carried a
moral and employed understatement,
word-play, irony, and sophisticated
risque allusions.

This same trend was followed in
the Spring Issue, and only in last
year’s Finals Issue was the local
scene the predominant outlet for
the humor in the magazine. This
was done because we believed it
necessary to introduce Washington
and Lee to the Freshmen. The task
was fulfilled rather well.

Collegian Highly Lauded
In closing, I feel that a little honk-

 

ing of the horn of self might be
justified. The Southern Collegian last
year was one of the two or three
most respected and universally laud-
ed college humor magazines in the
nation. Its subscriptions rate high
among parents, alumni, and at girls’
schools all over the east coast. The
magazine was read and enjoyed by
the assistant dean of a prominent
eastern theological seminary. Al-
though a couple of dunning letters
came in from parents about the mag-
izine, the letters of praise outnum-
bered them 20 to 1. More than once
we received envelopes from parents
and alumni which included a dollar
with the comment, “Your first issue
alone was worth the price of sub-
scription.”
Collegian Reflects Humor

All of this is not to say that the
Collegian is a magazine of literary
merit—we have the Shenandoah to
serve that purpose. The humor mag-
azine aims at reflecting the humor
on this campus. It hopes to make
people laugh on a big dance week-
end. You will find, Mr. Day, upon
checking through back issues, that
the magazine has consistently up-
held many different forms of humor,
and that although some of it has
been rather vile, some of it has also
been sophisticated, and almost all of
it at least has been entertaining to
most members of the student body.

Policy of the Magazine

If the students wish to do away
with the Collegian, they may easily
do so. Two things can make humor
detestable—the mocking of human
misery, and the mocking of religious
conviction. Precious little of the
former, and none of the latter, was
included last year in the magazine.
I hope that this same policy will
be followed for the remainder of
this year. But I also hope that we
are not so sophisticated as to stand
on a pinnacle of moral piety and
thumb our noses at an occasional
criticism of our times, whatever the
form of humor employed.

The Goals of a College Education Involve
Intangible Ideals of Character and Spirit

By JIM DeYOUNG

What should a good college strive
to inculcate in its students?

This is a much discussed question
and one which concerns us all at
this time.

A major drawback of many col-
leges today is the increasing trend
to place more and more emphasis
upon the purely academic aspect of
education while failing to instill a
sense of values in the student. The
development of these values is in-
herently part of a sound education,

 

and a college must not assume that

these values are a part of the stu-
dent before he reaches college.
Nevertheless, many schools ignore
this aspect of education, emphasizing
only the academics.

Versatility

A college should strive to develop
well-rounded students. At this uni-
versity there is active participation
in athletics and_ social activities
which greatly adds to the well-
roundedness of the student’s life
here.

Much emphasis is also placed on
a broad curriculum, for all students
have to take science as well as
courses in the humanities field, thus
assuring them of a most important
liberal education.

Conviction and enthusiasm, more-
over, are important qualities in a
person’s character. The ability to
make up one’s mind and draw con-
clusions about conflicting opinions
is an inherent part of conviction.
The common maxim “to weight and
consider” is important here in teach-
ing the student how to think mat-

 

ters out for himself. Once the stu-
dent has reached a conclusion and
has become set in his idea, he will
usually follow up his belief with
active enthusiasm.

The Honor System

Ideals that are inculeated in an
individual are an essential part of
a student's character. At W&L, the
Honor System teaches us perhaps
the most prized ideal. Good sports-
manship and the ability to give and
take praise and criticism should
also be found and developed in stu-
dents.

Communication, the ability to
write and speak clearly, is very
important in our lives. One meets a
test in some kind of expression every
day of his life and if he fails in
this test, he cannot hope to attain
real success.

Tolerance and independence taken
together are desirable qualities. One
will constantly confront many for-
eign and conflicting ideas. It is not
only necessary to respect these

their CAC season with a 3-0 mark

“When you intercept five passe:
you have to look on the game as a

fine defensive effort,’ McLaughlin +
said.

“The mud _ slowed our offenses
considerably, but we were very

proud of our defense.”

In the Generals’ first seven games
they allowed more than 15 points
per game, but when the going got
tough, the defense got tough.

A defense led by tackles Bob
Payne, Phil McCaleb, Jim Sylvester;
guards Mickey Walker and George
Gossman; center Mike Sheffey; ends
John Madison and Buck Ogilvie;
and backs Stu Yoffe, Tommy Keesee,
and Chuck Lane, shined in both the
Sewanee and Southwestern games.

Washington and Lee held Se-
wanee’s high scoring machine to
only 156 yards total offense and
limited tough Southwestern to 124
yards total offense.

Against Southwestern, Payne,
Walker Yoffe, Keesee, and Sheffey
were the defensive standouts.

“Payne had a terric day. He cer-
tainly led the in tackles.
Time and time again he was in

“We can’t overlook Keesee and
Yoffe either. They both made key
interceptions and Yofle’s tackling
was terrific all night.”

With the first CAC grid crown
snugly tucked under his arm, Coach

McLaughlin was admittedly a happy
man,

“We were pleased with the sea-
son,” he said, “with the loss of 22

for losing so many boys.”

Reverence and Gratitude

and gratitude further-
more are qualities that should be
sought by the college student. The
respect for age, seniority, and know-
ledge in the professor-student re-

observation and appreciation. The
acknowledgement of what other
people have done before us in de-
veloping and adding to the large

be in the center of our minds.

Bahai Speaker
Addresses UCA

The

to be

Bahai Faith, which purports
a universal religion, was the
subject of a series of UCA-sponsor-
ed speeches given by Dr. John Mc-
Cants yesterday

According to Dr. McCants,
Bahai Faith is one of the newer re-
ligions of the world, and now
settled in more than 250 countries
and dependencies. Its adherents
come from a wide range of national,
racial, religious, and back-
grounds.

the

is

class

Dr. McCants told a group in the
Student Union last night that “One
of the basic tenets of the Bahai Faith
is that it accepts the founders of all
existing major faiths as equally oc-

cupying the station of Manifesta-
tions of God, and that Bahai rec-

ognizes the religions they established
as being genuine and true expres-
sions of God’s message.

Bahai therefore seeks to reconcile
the wide diversifications of religious

belief in the world today and to

| establish a true world religion.”

Dr. McCants met with a Compa-
irative Religion class yesterday morn-
ing, and discussed Bahai in con-
ferences yesterday afternoon. He

concluded his visit to W&L with an
address in the Student Union spon-

sored by the University Christian
Association.

Dr. McCants attended Southern |
Methodist University, Florida State

University, and the Perkins School

ot The ology.

The Welfare State
The aim of a social welfare state
is to help those who cannot help

FINE FOOD IS A SPECIALTY

Is Life Devoid Of Emotons?

But in doing so, are
lishing that which we really want?
Economically, it is very expensive
for the better-to-do to support the
less-well-to-do. In caring for the
ignorant, aged, lazy, downtrodden,
and helpless are we not preserving
misery and killing their incentive to
better

we acomp-

themselves?

The Problem of People

Practically speaking, the popula-
tion boom presents a greater prob-
lem than the atomic bomb. If we
support those who cannot support
themselves, they will multiply and
our children will have many more
to support than we.

And again, “should man be pre-
best, longest, and most
agreebly?” Should there not be a
question of quality? Do we want
more men rather than better men?

Or should we concentrate on de-

served,

veloping better men, even if the
lesser must be neglected?
