Wheeler Novel, ‘Fail-Safe,’
‘Should Burst On Public’

By SHANNON JUNG

Dr. J. Harvey Wheeler of the
W&L political science department
has collaborated with Eugent Bur-
dick, co-author of The Ugly Amer-
ican, to produce a Book-of-the-
Month Club selection. The book, en-
titled Fail-Safe, was called by the
Editorial Board of the Club, “an
instant unanimous choice.”

The Board describes the book as
“a novel that should burst upon
the reading public like a bomb.”
Americans’ unbridled worship of
the machine and contempt for the
intellect form the central theme of
this work.

Clifton Fadiman, a member of the
Editorial Board, says in reviewing
the book, “Experience teaches re-
viewers to shun superlatives, es-
pecially cliche superlatives. But, be-
cause I know no simpler, no better
way to put the matter, I am driven
to one: Fail-Safe is the most excit-
ing novel I have read in at least
ten years.”

Dr. Wheeler, Professor of Political
Science at Washington and Lee for
five years, has been a member of
the faculty since 1954. Earning his
B.A. and M.A. at Indiana Univer-
sity, Wheeler continued his studies
at Harvard, where he received his
doctorate.

Wheeler on Leave

Wheeler has been on leave of
absence from the Department of
Political Science to work on a pro-
ject for the Fund for the Republic
of the Ford Foundation. This pro-
ject is individual from the book.
He will return in September of ’63.

He has published many articles
in such magazines as The American
Quarterly, The Reporter, Ethics,
American Historical Review, West-
ern Political Quarterly, and the

 

Shenandoah. A brief narrative which |’ —

Wheeler
vided the central theme for
new publication.

Explaining its title, fail-safe is
said to be “a fixed point in the sky
where the planes will orbit until
they get a positive order to go in
and bomb. Fail-safe simply means
that if something fails, it is still safe.”

The indefinite time of the novel is
“the very near future, perhaps to-
morrow, perhaps five minutes away,”
explains the Book-of-the-Month
Club News. The co-authors have
east a danger signal to the human
race. The situation stacks up thus:
The watchers at the Big Board, con-
trolling the rehearsed maneuvers of
ever-vigilant, ever-mobile bombers,
note with horror that a blip at the
number 6 Activating Mechanism has
gone past the fail-safe point. As a
result, the Vindicators (insuperably
efficient bombers) are told by the
computers to bomb Russia. And
there the real story begins.

Book To Be Serialized

The lesson that Fail-Safe teaches
is the consequences of world con-
tempt for the human intellect: the
machine will take over completely.
The machine that has no interest in
anyone’s survival.

The book will be serialized in The |
Saturday Evening Post and there is
talk to the effect that Darryl Zan-

on the Wheeler-Burdick collabora-
tion.

Fadiman goes on to praise the
book saying, “Almost surely Messers. |
Burdick and Wheeler will be read
by hundred of thousands. ...In its)
long history, the Club has ‘offered
few, if any, books so sheerly excit-
ing as this one.

Congressional seat.

Club president Rob Wheelock said
that the plans include door-to-door
canvassing, downtown window ad-
vertising, literature distribution,
bonfires, beer rallies, cider and pret-
zels.

Advertising space has already been
obtained in several downtown store
windows. Campaigning begins next
Monday with a two hour door-to-
door session in Lexington followed
by a free keg of beer for those
club members helping. Tuesday,
Oct. 16, the Lexington Republicans
will sponsor a rally at the high
school.

On November 3, a bonfire and
beer rally is planned. “New Fron-

For Freshman Executive Position

After a two-hour discussion last night at the Pi Kappa
Phi house, the Independent Party nominated Joe Miller, a

pledge of Delta Tau Delta, as

Executive Committee post.

PEP’s Pledge :
6 Non-Jewish
Sophomores

Phi Epsilon Pi, Washington and
Lee’s five-man Jewish fraternity,
pledged six Gentile non-fraternity
sophomores Sunday in an effort to
build membership to an operating
quota.

The Phi Eps, long in danger of
closing due to steadily waning num-
bers, were on the verge of fold-
ing a week ago.

President Dick Herman said the
fraternity had thought about open
rush, “but wasn’t sure non-Jewish
boys would be interested.”

A meeting a week ago with sever-
al NFU upperclassmen resulted in
Sunday’s move.

Herman said the Phi Eps hope to
pick up several freshmen and some
more upperclassmen in the next few
weeks,

Those who pledged were:

Kline Bolton, sophomore dean’s
lish student, Robert E. Lee scholar
and varsity wrestler.

Bill Surbaugh, sophomore mem-
ber of the debate team.

Bill Supon, member of the Glee
Club, UCA, and Ring-tum Phi.

Braxton Tabb, Bob Brooks, and
Eric Hanssen.

A nominal

pledging period of

| three weeks is scheduled to go into
| effect for the six immediately. At
| the end of that time, they will be

eligible for initiation.

The Phi Ep kitchen, which closed
last year, will be re-opened second
semester when most of the new
“pledges” will move into the house.

House membership for the Phi
Eps, with pledges, brothers, and so-
cial members, is now 13.

Living capacity of the house is
16, according to Herman.

“We have quite a few ideas for
innovations,” Herman said. “We are,
I suppose, a new kind of social fra-
ternity at Washington and Lee—the
first integrated one, anyway.”

Among the “new ideas” Herman
voiced were plans for shortening
freshmen pledge training period
from a whole semester, revision of
general rush procedures, and chang-

its candidate for the freshman

Nashville, Tennessee, was the

freshman camp this year. He
kplays on the line of the freshman
football team, and is now on the
W&L Debate Team.

Elected president of the Delt
pledge class, Miller was the student
body president of his high school
in Nashville as well as being class
president of his graduating class
each year throughout school.

Scholastic Honors

Besides being an avid participant
in athletics of all kinds, Miller is
highly qualified scholastically. He
was a National Merit Scholarship
Finalist, valedictorian of his senior
class in high school, and he received
class medals in English, American
and ancient history, chemistry, biol-
ogy, and mechanical drawing.

As captain of the football team
at his high school, Miller was named
to the All-City, All-Division, and
All-State football teams. His senior
year he was named the most popu-
lar student and the best all-around
student by his classmates.

Guild Comments

Known by his friends as possessing
natural leadership ability, Miller has
gotten to know a large portion of
the freshman class already. Steve
Guild, Independent Party chairman,
said last night after Miller’s nomi-
nation was confirmed that: “The In-
dependent Party chose Joe Miller
not only for his outstanding quali-
fications, but also for the definite
qualities of leadership which he has
shown. Miller, as the freshman
Executive Committeeman, will be
another step in the continuation of
responsible student government at
W&L..”

The poem was sent to Shenandoah
on July 22, Boatwright said. Cum-

closely following his great contem-
poraries Ernest Hemingway and
William Faulkner. Cummings had
been universally recognized as one
of America’s greatest men of let-

W&L Campus Political Situation: How It Stands Now

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor
Tuesday Edition

With the nominations last night
of the two freshmen candidates for
the Executive Committee, politics
has once again come to the fore-
front on the W&L campus. Each fall
and spring, the various issues that
are fashioned by the two political
parties are batted around, and from
year to year, the elections result
vary slightly.

Last year at this time, the two
parties were unequally balanced, as
they are now. The University Party
consisted of all the Red Square
houses, plus the SAE’s, ZBT’s, the
KA’s, the DU’s and the Sigma Chis.

 

The Independent Party was made
up of the Phi Gams, Delts, Phi Psis,
Kappa Sigs, Pi Phi, Phi Ep, Lambda
Chi and SPE.
Vote Deficit

This put ten houses against eight
houses, at that time, and one of the
eight fraternities in the Independent |
Party, Phi Epsilon Pi, number ed |
only 12. Any candidate running for

election from the Independent Party

had to overcome a vote deficite of
considerably over one hundred bal-

on few elements to begin with:

party politics have at this point is
hard to say.

New Pledging Proposals
The IFC last night discussed what we believe to be three
very significant proposals: 1) that fraternities have a uniform
1.0 initiation requirement, 2) that pledges who fall below a .4
at mid-semester will not be forced to take part in pledging

activities, and 3) that freshmen who do not make a .75 either
semester of their first year will not be allowed to live or take

meals at fraternity houses.

These proposals are designed to combat the notion of many
die-hard fraternity men that “‘it’s not for knowledge that we
come to college.’”’ Specifically, the IFC hopes to encourage
freshman scholarship by alleviating the pressures of pledging
on border-line students and, at the same time, applying eco-
nomic pressure on the fraternities themselves to promote bet-
ter grades. In addition, the proposals would tend to eliminate

some of the intellectual dead

forced to put up with and that drag down fraternity averages.

It is high time that fraternities realize that Washington and
Lee is changing and that, if the fraternity system is to remain an
integral part of the University, fraternities must adjust to the
changes. Those fraternities which insist on placing social
activities above scholarship might very well be partying them-

selves out of existence.

A Threat To The Party System

The announcement of the Freshman EC candidates brings
to mind one of the more pressing problems facing W&L’s
student body, that of the present campus political setup. As it
stands now, the Independent Party is on the losing end of an
eleven-seven fraternity split, with very little hope of reducing

the odds in the near future.

The party system here is the logical outgrowth of the fra-
ternity system. Each fraternity is understandably anxious to
promote its own members, and the best way to do so is to
co-operate with other fraternities by agreeing on candidates and
then pooling votes. This system, despite frequent criticism,
has been the basis for student government at Washington and
Lee, consistently supplying responsible student leadership. All
things considered, the party system is a decided asset, one
which we should try to preserve.

The present situation poses a threat to the system, for the
Independent Party has seriously considered taking the easy
way out and disbanding. But they have no one to blame for
their problems but themselves. This time last year, the Big
Three student body positions were held by Independents, as
were several other “‘prestige’’ positions. In addition, the In-
dependent Party enjoyed a virtual monopoly of the non-
fraternity vote. But inept leadership and lax party discipline
in last spring’s elections led to the SPE switch and loss of the
non-fraternity vote, resulting in the present unbalanced split.

The houses in the Independent Party are admittedly at a
disadvantage now, but we urge them not to throw up their
hands in defeat. A two-party system benefits the entire Uni-
versity, and it is the Independent Party’s obligation to do their

best to make it work.

Foreign Exchange Students Give
Candid Impressions Of America

By JIM DEJONG

We hear a lot—maybe even too
much—about student exchange pro-.
grams, U.S. college customs as op-|
posed to European practices, etc.
It’s hard to single out the truth!
from the propaganda, on both sides. |

But four W&L students this year
should know what the straight story
is. They are here on grants, ex-
change programs and as individuals |
from three European and a South)
American country.

In his second year at W&L,}
Alonso Mendoza comes from Sucre, |
Bolivia, a town of about 44,000 peo- |
ple. Raimondo Strassoldo joins the!
Generals from a small Italian vil-|
lage near Trieste. |

Hailing from Scandinavia are
Kris Krisoferson from Upsala,
Sweden, and Jan-Erik Berg of Os-
lo, Norway.

Mendoza, who is following a pre-|
scribed four-year course here, plans |
tentatively to major in either French
or philosophy, and noted the lan-
guage barrier as one of his chief
difficulties in adjusting to school.

IFC President Replies

To the Ring-tum Phi,

I regret that I find it necessary
to correct several things about the
article concerning delayed rush in
the paper Tuesday. The first mis-
take was in the headline—Fraterni-
ties Say No To Delay In Rush. It
was not the fraternities who de-
cided to drop it, but rather the
fraternity presidents and the News-
paper Editors who met not as rep-
resentatives of fraternities, but rath-
er as responsible members of the
Student Body. The purpose of the
meeting was to discuss the merits
and demerits of the plan freely and
as individuals. We specifically kept
a reporter out of the meeting in
order to promote freer discussion.

There was constant reference in
the article to “Kyger’s” plan. While
I would not mind credit for this
plan since I believe it to be a good
one, it simply is not true that this
is my plan. Parts of the original
plan were mine; however, the finish-
ed plan was the combined effort
of a group of seven people, with
significant contributions from George
Honts, Bob Doenges, Tony Schle-
singer, Roy Goodwin, and myself.

As for the “radical change” label,
I feel this plan is much less radical
than the other plans we were asked
to consider which include Sopho-
more rush, Second semester rush,
between semesters rush, extended
rush during the first half of the
semester and others. We rejected
these in favor of an original plan
more suited to W&L.

When newspaper reporters are not
permitted inside a meeting, it is
the newspaper’s duty to print the
story correctly as it is given to them.
Apparently the story was altered
after the reporter turned it in. May
I suggest that if the newspaper is
to be the responsible voice of the

vertising and journalism at W&lL. |
He seemed particularly impressed |
with what he called the “personal |
relationship between students and
teachers.”

Berg, too, is a Fulbright scholar
and wants to major in economics.
He shared Mendoza’s views on the
language barrier, adding quickly
that the problem was not in talking
to students “but in reading text-
books.”

Krisoferson’s one year stint at
W&L is being financed by a Scott
scholarship. He will return next
year to study in his native Sweden.

Dating—Here and There

The first—and probably liveliest
topic of discussion during the Ring-
tum Phi’s interview with the foreign
students was that of dating.

In Bolivia, according to Mendoza,
college campuses don’t have social
fraternities. Dating and parties usu-
ally are put on by various clubs
and school classes, with much less
organization in social groups than

 

is found in the U.S. fraternity sys-
tem.

One thing the Bolivian college stu-
dent does have in common with his
U.S. counterpart, though: beer, says
Mendoza, is the national drink of
the college set.

In Italy, Strassoldo said, young
people date “any night of the week,”
without the emphasis to Saturday
night dating he finds here.

Young Italy Dances
Young Italy may do it different
nights, but they do the same things.
Movies, dancing, and beaching are
all popular dating activities.

And, Strassoldo added, an Italian
boy doesn’t enter a girl’s home until
he is “quite serious about her.”

Berg said that Norwegian dating
customs were pretty much the same
as American, but commented that
transportation was a major problem
in his country.

Passing to the subject of compara-
tive standards of living, Mendoza

Lybass Reviews
Summer Stay
In Italian Town

By BILL ATWELL

What’s it like to spend a summer
in Italy?

To Junior Tom

Lybass, it was
great—except for a scarcity of water
fountains and too many oil-and-

vinegar salads.

Lybass, who last year represented
W&L on the General Electric Col-
lege Bowl, lived this summer with
an Italian family in Reggio, Ca-
labria, Italy.

He was participating in a _ pro-
gram called “Experiments in In-
ternational Living” which sends
American students to live in homes
of peoples throughout the world.

Lybass stayed with a family of
four, and seemed to be particularly
impressed by the cheerfulness and
the spirit of the family.

“Life in Italy is at a far easier
and more enjoyable pace than life
in the United States,” he said.

According to Lybass, the main re-
creation of the Italian populace is
either walking or swimming. “And
they like to talk,” he added.

Everybody who goes to Italy raves
about Italian food, and Lybass was
no exception. He did limit his com-
ments to a word about the always-
present salads, and a remark on the
main dish of the Italian meal.

“Spaghetti and other noodle con-
coctions served as the staple food
most of the time,” he said. Lybass
didn’t comment on Italian wines,
exotic dishes, or the famous culinary
paradises of Rome.

Lybass ran into only two major
difficulties: the language barrier and
the lack of public water fountains
when he was thirsty.

About the language barrier, he
said, “towards the end of the sum-
mer I had little trouble making my-
self understood.” In anticipation of
his trip, Lybass had been taking
lessons in Italian from Mr. Steph-
enson of Washington and Lee’s Ger-
man department.

But the water fountain problem
stayed with him. Lybass said that
there “just didn’t seem to be enough
public drinking fountains, which
seems strange when you consider
how many other kinds of fountains
there are in Italy.”

Although he paid short trips to
most of the larger cities in Italy,
Lybass favored Rome over any other
city he saw.

On his way back to the United
States, he stopped over in Paris.
“Everyone likes Paris,” he said. “But
I personally prefer Rome. It just
seems to be a happier place.”

“And that,” he added, “goes for
all of Italy.”

The Mess at Ole Miss: A Comment On Violence

(Editor’s note: Dr. Hodges, of
Washington and Lee’s department
of religion, is a native of Miss-
issippi and as such has been in
close contact with the problem of
desegregation in the South. The
Tuesday staff of the Ring-tum Phi
asked him to express his views
on the Oxford crisis. His comments
follow.)

By DR. LOUIS W. HODGES

James Meredith, a Mississippian,
is enrolled at Ole Miss. Two men are
dead as a result of riotous violence
on the night Meredith was placed
on the campus. Hundreds of thous-
ands of dollars have been spent and
property destroyed. The state leg-
islature called for, and then called
off, an investigation of liberal ele-
ments in the faculty of the Univer-
sity. Mr. Barnett has stood, and to
a degree still stands, in defiance of
the government of the United States.
Men from all over the South have
migrated to Oxford, many of them
armed, most of them to resist the
admission of Meredith to the Uni-
versity.

The list of major developments,
events with far-reaching implica-
tions, could be lengthened to sev-
eral pages.

 

Different observers explain these
developments in different ways.
Some of the students shout to
Meredith: “nigger, you have blood

Or. Hodges ...

on your hands now.” Others point
accusingly to the student body, to
“outsiders,” to Barnett.
A Symbol of Conflict |
However historians are eventually |
to assess responsibility for the cris-
is, Mississippi is to be viewed at

 

 

   

least as a symbol of deep-rooted
conflict in the contemporary South.
On the one hand, that state is re-
garded by the segregationist as the
final and most virtuous defender of
what is interestingly called “the
Southern way of life (as though
the crowd in the Sunday riot were
following that way of life).

Bigotry and Its Victims Involved

On the other hand, and in part for
the same reason, Mississippi is re-
garded by the Negro as the central
fortress of forces of segregation and
discrimination. Thus it is a first line
of attack. So it is that the racial
bigot and the victim of bigotry are
at once empathetically involved in
Oxford.

Since most of the readers of the |
R-t P are aware of the events and
the analyses of those events pre- |

 

sented through other media, it!
seems appropriate here to look at
a special facet of the Ole Miss|

crisis, viz., Sunday night’s violence. |
What was it like? Why did it oc-
cur? What are the likely results? |

A Kind of Calculated Violence

This crowd of students and “out-
siders” was patently not a “mob” in
the true and specialized sense of the '

| the governor’s office and in his pub- |

| crisis he spoke of fighting “race mix-

term. There was apparently no col-
lective or mass hysteria which re-
moved all semblance of rational
behavior. This was rather a kind
of calculated violence, violence en- |
tered into for a purpose, rather like
the Civil War than like a lynch
mob,

Violence and the threat of violence
has become come a part of Southern
strategy. Barnett pointed out that
if Meredith were forcibly enrolled
at Ole Miss violence would ensue.
It did. But his was a kind of self-
fulfilling prophecy: it amounted in
effect to an invitation to violence.
He talked of “dying” and “suffer-
ing” for the cause of segregation.
Both in his campaign for election to
the Oxford

lie utterances about

 

ing” to the end.
Segregation: a Lost Cause?

Mississippi has thus become some- |
thing of a symbol for the segrega-
tionist element in the South. Missis-

| sippi is making a last-ditch stand |
| for what most now recognize as a
| lost cause. But it is a stand which

has to be taken in order to save}
face. We cannot admit that we were
wrong; thus we must fight to show |

that we were really right, or at least |
that we still think so.

However reprehensible violence
may be, then, it does have a salu-
tary effect on the prejudiced mind. |

It goes like this: The racist South- |
erner has long lived with a guilty
conscience, a deep-seated sense of
guilt over his denial to the Negro of
basic human and _ constitutional
rights. In the words of Gunnar
Myrdal, he faces “an American di-
lemma.” His problem is that his
democratic creed is in effect denied
by his racial practice. Feelings of
guilt result.

 

Resist God or the Kennedys

In an effort to live with his guilt |
the racist builds elaborate struc- |
tures of justification for his treat-|
ment of the Negro. It is his attach- |
ment to these structures—e.g., that
“the Negro is happy this way’— |
that prevents a more sane solution
to problems like Ole Miss. He con-
fronts a new dilemma: either fight |
or deny God and the cause of right- |
eousness by allowing Meredith in
Ole Miss. He sees his choice as one |
between disobedience to God or!
disobedience to “the Kennedys.” |
(The racist cannot bear to think he
is fighting the democratic tradition |

of America so he substitutes a safer
name for his enemy.)

Thus two inner forces move the
racist to violence. One is his con-
scious conviction that segregation is

| morally right. The other is his whole

process of dealing with a sense of
guilt which grows out of the con-
flict between democratic creed and
his racist practice.

The Southerner’s Absolution

Strangely then, given the nature
of the second source of violence,
violence may bring a kind of abso-
lution to the segregationist. It may
serve as a kind of purgatory in
which he has gone down valiantly
fighting for a cause. He has not lost
face by giving up the cause but he
has been beaten by the odds against
him. This may well bring a sense of
relief and an openness to be moved
in the direction of desegration,

We may have to tolerate tempor-
ary violence as a necessary evil. In
order to live with himself the South-
erner needs and _ subconsciously
wants to suffer. Violence thus may
do more in the long run to help
than to hurt race relations, This does
not mean that we can or should con-
done violence; it does mean that we
live in a world where good sprouts
unexpectedly from evil.

Wasps’ Hawkins Inflicts Fatal Sting On WEL

*

Speedy Halfback Scores Five TDs

As E&H Snaps Win

By JOHN ALLGOOD

The rain that must fall into every
life poured on Washington and Lee's
hard-fighting football team Satur-
day.

Emory and Henry’s angry Wasps
unleashed this deadly deluge in the
form of halfback Earl Hawkins.
Hawkins turned, twisted, raced and
dragged his way to five touchdowns
and a 38-33 E&H victory.

Not only did this Emory and
Henry win avenge a 27-6 loss to
W&L last year, but it also snapped «
the Generals’ 2l-game non-losing +
string.

Hawkins Spoils Rally

For six minutes in the third period
it looked as if W&L would pull out
a win, but Hawkins, an intercepted
pass, a costly penalty and a 46-yard
desperation pass quickly snatched
the win away from the Generals.

Protecting a 33-28 lead early in
the third period, W&L had the a,
Wasps with third and nine at the "Wii
Emory 27.

End Bill Munsey, however, worked ©
his way behind two W&L defenders
and grabbed a 46-yard pass from
quarterback Jim Hawkins to give
the Wasps first and ten at the W&L
ai.

Seven plays put the Wasps on the
two with first and goal.

Goal Line Stand

Two cracks by fullback C. A.
Burton and one by halfback Charlie
Teefey failed to dent W&L’s goal —
line defense. i

Then Hawkins put on the hero’s
cloak that he had worn all day for
the final time. With one mighty jim
lunge he plunged over for the =i
Wasps’ winning tally.

The Wrecker
Hawkins was a one-man wreck-

The 6-4, 215-pound transfer from
Florida State University gained 117
yards rushing, scored five touch-
downs, including an 88-yard dash
with the opening kickoff, and passed
for three two-point conversions.

W&L’s defense couldn’t cope with
the bulldozing Hawkins. He either
shook off, side-stepped, or just drag-
ged would-be tacklers along with
him.

Only a one-handed ankle tackle
by Tommy Keesee pulled Hawkins
down for a loss (eight yards).

Outside of Stu Yoffe’s 36-yard
scoring reverse, Henry Sackett’s
23-yard dash, Tommy Keesee’s 22-
yard sprint with a direct snap, and
Dan Manson’s 13-yard gain, the
W&L offense could hardly gain more
than a yard at a time.

It was a day for long dashes.

Sackett raced 30 yards with the
second half kickoff, Bill David
sprinted 91 yards with a punt re-
turn, and Yoffe chugged 36 yards on
his reverse for the Generals’ third
quarter scoring.

Out of 12 punt and kickoff returns
the shortest was eight yards, and
nine were over 20 yards.

Sackett and Skip Chase tallied
the Generals’ two first period scores

on one- -yard plunges, turned the second half kickoff

 

‘OFF AND RUNNING—Halfback Henry Sackett took
over the leadership of the Washington and Lee ground gainers
Saturday by grinding out 50 yards. The speedy back also re-

93 yards for a touchdown.

 

Booters Shut Out Jackets, 4-0;
Shank Leads X-C’s 26-33 Win

By ANDY KILPATRICK

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
shut out Randolph-Macon, 4-0, Fri-
day.

Jim Mell scored twice and Howie
Busse and Charlie Sweet fired one
goal each.

Coach Joe Lyles described the
game as a “well-controlled, short
passing game in which all our goals
came through good team work.”

Green Shines

Tom Green kept the Yellow
Jackets in check with a good game
in the goal while halfbacks Bruce

Macon Friday on a short, flat course.

Shank, the “cheval de fer” of
the harriers, came within 25 seconds
of matching the Randolph-Macon
record in his first competition of the
year.

Shank was backed by Freshman
Riff O’Conner in the fourth and
sophomores Andy Kilpatrick, sixth,
and Rick Rogers, seventh.

Field Goal
_ Nips Frosh

Washington and Lee’s freshmen
found an offense to go with their
iron-wall defense Friday, but still
couldn’t capture a victory.

Staunton Military Academy’s Bill
Anderson booted a 22-yard field
goal in the second quarter to give
Staunton a 3-0 victory.

The Light Brigade’s new offense
came through the airways as the
Brigade picked up 125 yards pass-
ing.

Roll-out Pass

“We found our quarterbacks were
so short that they couldn’t spot
their receivers downfield using the
drop back pass,’ coach Dana Swan
said, “therefore, we switched to a
roll-out pass which worked beauti-
fully.”

Halfback Mike Goode topped the
W&L receivers with three catches
for 84 yards. Two of Goode’s recep-
tions set up potential scoring threats
for the Light Brigade.

“We won everything but the ball
game,” Swan said.

Twice the Generals moved within
scoring range, but each drive was
thwarted.

A Costly Fumble

The Brigade’s charge ground to
a halt once because of a fumble and
once because of Staunton’s defense.

W&L’s defense again stood out.
Linebackers Jeff Novinger and Dave
Shufflebarger anchored the stout
Brigade line which held Staunton
to 160 yards total offense.

Shufflebarger with 34 yards in five
carries, Goode, and quarterbacks
Larry Craig (2-5 for 50 yards and
John Curran (4-10 for 75 yards)
starred on offense.

 

NOTICE
All third-round fall tennis tourna-
ment matches must be completed

must be posted immediately after

seemed, with the tradition of con-

WHAT TO WEAR TILL THE DOCTOR COMES

Now that you have enrolled and paid your fees and bought
your books and found your way around campus and learned to
hate your roommate, it is time to turn to the most important
aspect of college life. I refer, of course, to clothes.

What does Dame Fashion decree for the coming school year?
(Incidentally, Dame Fashion is not, as many people belie, a
fictitious character. She was a real Englishwoman who lived in
Elizabethan times and, indeed, England is forever in her debt.
During the invasion of the Spanish Armada, Dame Fashion—
not yet a Dame but a mere, unlettered country lass named
Moll Flanders—during the invasion, I say, of the Spanish
Armada, this dauntless girl stood on the white cliffs of Dover
and turned the tide of battle by rallying the drooping morale of
the British fleet with this stirring poem of her own composition:

Don’t be gutless,
Men of Britain.
Swing your cutlass,
We ain't quittin’.
Smash the Spanish,
Sink their boats,
Make ’em vanish,
Like a horse makes oats,

For Good Queen Bess,
Dear sirs, you gotta
Make a mess
Of that Armada,

You won't fail!
Knock ’em flat!
Then we'll drink ale

    
 

  

{1 1490

And stuff like that.

As a reward for these inspirational verses Queen Elizabeth
dubbed her a Dame, made her Poet Laureate, and gave her
the Western Hemisphere except Duluth. But this was not the
extent of Dame Fashion’s service to Queen and country. In
1589 she invented the laying hen, and she was awarded a life-
time pass to Chavez Ravine. But she was not to end her days
in glory. In 1591, alas, she was arrested for overtime jousting
and imprisoned for thirty years in a butt of malmsey. This later
became known as Guy Fawkes Day.)

But I digress. Let us get back to campus fashions. Certain to
be the rage again this year is the cardigan (which, curiously
enough, was named after Lerd Cardigan, who commanded the
English fleet against the Spanish Armada. The sweater is only
one product of this remarkable Briton’s imagination. He also
invented the glottal stop, the gerund, and the eyelid, without
which winking, as we know it today, would not be possible),

But I digress. The cardigan,

I say, will be back, which is, I

believe, cause for rejoicing. Why? Beeause the cardigan has
nice big pockets in which te carry your Marlboro Cigarette

and that, good friends, is ample reason for celebration as all of
you will agree who have enjoyed Marlboro’s fine, comfortable,
mellow flavor and Marlboro’s filter. So why don’t you slip into
your cardigan and hie yourself to your tobacconist for some
good Marlboros? They come in soft pack or flip-top box. Cardi-

gans come in pink for girls and blue for boys,

And so is

Marlboro a matter of taste—the best taste that can possibly
be achieved by experienced growers and blenders—by sci-
ence, diligence, and tender loving care. Try @ pack.
