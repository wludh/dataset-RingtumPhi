TOPIC WILL BE MODERN POETRY
By STEVE SMITH

Northrop Frye, considered by many scholars the foremost
literary critic of this era, has been announced as the speaker

for Washington and Lee’s 42nd

Frye, who will come to W&L under the auspices of the

University Center in Virginia,

of Imagery in Modern Poetry,”

certain poems of Eliot, Yeats, and*¥———

N eophyte

Wallace Stevens.

Frye, Principal of Victoria College,
University of Toronto, is the author
of Fearful Symmetry, the most im- |
portant book on Blake’s poetry in
recent years; and Anatomy of Criti-
cism, praised as the most influential
study of literary criticism to be
written in the present century.

New Critical Method

In Anatomy of Criticism Frye
presents his own method of criticism,
an attempt to treat literature and
its forms comprehensively. The
book and its method were received
by widespread acclaim.

Frye is also the editor of Milton,
Sound and Poetry, and the Canadi-
an Forum. He is a Fellow of the
Royal Society of Canada, former
chairman of the English Institute,
and a member of the Executive
Council of the Modern Languages
Association,

The Seminars in Literature pro-
gram, which was founded in 1951,
exists for the purpose of bringing
to the university about four speak-
ers a year. The Seminars commit-
tee cooperates with the Virginia
University Center, an organization
which attempts by a program of
speakers to overcome the isolation
possible to a small college.

Members of the University Center
include 21 Virginia colleges and
universities. Washington and Lee is
represented on the visiting schol-
ars committee of the Center by Pro-
fessor Allen W. Moger.

Speakers brought to Washington
and Lee under the Seminar program
are available for classroom discus-
sion with students.

Seminar Committee Members

The Seminar committee elected
four new members during the month
of October: Jerome Kahn, Taine
Tompkins, J. Paxton Davis, and
James Boatwright. Continuing from
last year on the committee are
Arthur R. Borden, Jr., William
Chaplain, Meade Christian, G. Fran-
cis Drake, Hunter Manson, Robert
Mottley, Philip Reidford, and Walker
Ronaldson,

Past speakers for the Seminars
in Literature have included William
Faulkner, John Ciardi, Stephen
Spender, Katherine Anne Porter,
and other famous names.

Frye will speak in duPont Audi- |
torium at 8:15 p.m., on the last
Wednesday in November.

The Seminars in Literature will
be held during the same week as
the annual Glasgow Endowment
Program.

By MALCOLM MORRIS
Four Washington and Lee fresh-
men, competing in the Wake Forest
Novice Tournament this past Friday
and Saturday, finished a strong sixth
in a field of twenty-four teams.

Losing only to the top four teams
in the “strength against strength”
tournament, both the affirmative and
negative sides compiled records of
four wins and two losses.

Mike Hayslip and Bob Potts, de-
bating the affirmative side of the
question, conquered William and
Mary, Randolph-Macon, Duke, and
the University of Richmond, be-
fore losing close rounds to George
Washington and the University of
Pittsburgh.

The negative team of John Mc-
Murry and Gareth Aden lost only
to the University of Richmond and
Wake Forest while defeating South
Carolina, Davidson, Lenoir-Rhyne,
and Duke.

 

 

Ahead of W&L’s sixth place team |
were George Washington, Wake.

Mike Hyslip, who led the men in
total points, received an award for
finishing eighth among the tourna- |
ment’s ninety-six speakers.

Debate team director William W.
Chaffiin said he was well pleased
with the results: “The best novice
record in several years.” He pointed
out Hayslip for his great potential
and appraised this year’s freshman
class as the most promising in re-
cent years.

Last year’s team finished even at
six wins and six losses in the same
tournament .

Release Anticipated This Week

By STEVE SMITH

James Boatwright, editor of Shen-
andoah, announced today that the
Washington and Lee literary maga-
zine will make its 1962-63 debut this
week. E. E. Cummings heads the
list of contributors to the first issue
under Boatwright’s direction.

The fall edition will include a
variety of poetry, fiction, and criti-
cism, by a wide range of writers.
“The issue has no particular theme,”
Boatwright said. “We've included
less criticism than usual this time;
instead ‘the emphasis has been on
the best fiction and verse available.”

Shenandoah is undergoing a basic
change in character beginning with
the coming issue. The first inova-
tion to be made was the appoint-
ment of Boatwright as the year’s
editor, subject to re-election by the
magazine’s editorial board; previous-
ly each issue of Shenandoah had

addition, Shenandoah will be pub-
lished quarterly instead of of the
former three times a year.

These moves have ben made in
an attempt to give Shenandoah a
consistent editorial policy, which
should improve the magazine gen-
erally. At the same time, the busi-
ness staff is driving to increase cir-
culation, notably by initiating the
sales of subscriptions as Christmas
gifts.

Dr. Morrison Hutcheson New Rector;
Mr. Caskie Remains Board Member

James R. Caskie, Lynchburg attorney and civic leader has
resigned as Rector of Washington and Lee University’s Board
of Trustees, it was announced today by President Fred C. Cole.

Mr Caskie, who is 77, informed the Board of his decision

at its regular October meeting.

prevent him from continuing as Rector, although he will re-
—- on

main a member of the Board.

Elected to succeed Mr. Caskie as
Rector was Dr. J. Morrison Hutche-
son, Richmond physician and _pro-
fessor emeritus at the Medical Col-
lege of Virginia.

Mr. Caskie joined Washington and
Lee’s Board in 1924, and was elected
Rector in 1953. He is a graduate of
Washington and Lee, receiving his
A.B. degree in 1906, and his LL.B.
degree in 1909.

Dr. Hutcheson, who is 79, received

Lee in 1902. He was elected to the
Board of Trustees in 1935, and has
served on its executive committee
since 1940.

“Under Mr. Caskie’s rectorship the
University has made great strides
in improving its academic program
and physical facilities,’ President
Cole commented. “The dedication of
Mr. Caskie to his Alma Mater is
clearly indicated in his willingness
to continue as a trustee, although he
feels it is necessary to relinquish his
chairmanship. Dr, Hutcheson’s long
service and close association with the
University gives assurance _ that
Washington and Lee will continue
its educational leadership.”

Mr. Caskie is senior partner in
the Lynchburg law firm of Caskie,
Frost, Davidson and Watts. In ad-
dition to his service as Rector, Mr.
Caskie also has acted as an unpaid
general counsel to Washington and
Lee University.

A native of Lovingston, Va., Mr.
Caskie began his law practice in
Lynchburg shortly after graduation
from Washington and Lee. He was
first a partner with his father,
George Evans Caskie, and upon his
father’s death in 1919, Mr. Caskie
practiced alone until 1925 when the
first of his present partners joined
his firm.

Civic and Church Leader

Among his church and civie ac-
tivities, Mr. Caskie has served as
director and secretary and treasurer
of the Presbyterian Orphans Home
in Lynchburg for 25 years, and also
as chairman of the board of the
Lynchburg Hospital Authority and
president of Lynchburg General
Hospital. He also serves as director
and attorney for numerous corpor-
ations.

Honor and the Libraries
As the Friday edition pointed out, there has been more
than a little confusion concerning the application of the Honor

System to the libraries. Unfortunately, and through no fault
of the editors, the Friday editorial only added to the confusion.

 

The Executive Committee has not laid down a hard and
fast rule that unauthorized removal of a book is automatically
an honor violation. There is a very good reason for this: a flat
statement linking unauthorized removal of books with the
Honor System would have the effect of categorizing honor
violations, and this, in turn, would inevitably lead to inflex-
ibility and perhaps injustice. The Executive Committee rightly
insists on trying every case on its own merits, using only
lying, cheating, and stealing as the prerequisites for action.

It was with this idea in mind that the EC ordered that
notices be posted in McCormick Library stating that “Cases
involving intentional, wrongful removal of books or any other
property from the library will be reported to the Executive
Committee for investigation as a possible violation of the
Honor System.” This simply means that the EC will investi-
gate each reported case and attempt to ascertain whether or not
stealing is involved. This does not represent a change in policy.
It simply means that the Student Library Committee is on the
watch for possible violations of the Honor System in the
library.

This same policy will prevail in the Commerce School li-
brary. Those statements will be removed which read ‘Removal
of any material from the Commerce Library will be considered
a breech of the Honor System,” and they will be replaced by
statements similar to those in McCormick Library.

Stealing is a violation of the Honor System, and stealing
from the various campus libraries is the same as stealing any-
where else. But the Honor System is not intended to be a
means by which to enforce rules, and, again, the libraries are
no exception,

Height Of Disillusionment

The London Daily Mail reports that Fidel Castro has been
in an especially bad mood lately.

Apparently he can’t get over the fact that this time last
week he was a nuclear power.

A Minor Mistake

Last Friday we printed an editorial in which we implied
that W&L and VMI had enjoyed a spirited athletic rivalry up
until W&L’s de-subsidization in 1954. Well, our chronology
was off about fifty years. The truth is that the last time Wash-
ington and Lee played VMI in football was back in the Victor-
ian era, somewhere around 1902. At that time the administra-
tions of both schools agreed that the rivalry was much too spirit-
od, and that cross-town athletic contests constituted a genuine
threat to the physical well-being of all those concerned. Evi-
dently, when W&L students sang that they would “fight, fight,
fight for every yard,” they meant exactly that, and thus, as a
matter of practical necessity, athletic competition between the
two schools ceased.

But a mere fifty years does not change our conviction that
VMI’s parade was a very worthwhile affair. At least two hun-
dred students turned out for the ceremony, and it is seldom that
W&L men voluntarily congregate in such numbers. This in
itself means something. Further, the atmosphere was definitely
one of friendliness; certainly no one wanted to fight.

The Friday edition’s opinion to the contrary, we think that
the VMI parade was a very effective way to promote under-
standing between the two student bodies. To the cliche that
“It’s a step in the right direction,” we will add another: “Better
late than never.”

To Our Subscribers

An Open Letter to Ring-tum Phi Subscribers:

In the beginning of the school year, an unavoidable sit-
uation resulted in many of our subscribers not receiving their
copies of The Ring-tum Phi. What had happened was that our
addressing machine was out of order for nearly three weeks,
during which time no papers could be mailed.

After the machine was adequately repaired, the circulation
staff was left with the job of mailing the accumulation of back
issues to subscribers. Obviously, some mistakes were made and
a few subscribers did not receive copies of some of the paper’s
edition that came out in that three-week period.

We apologize to anyone whom we overlooked, and we are
eager to rectify the situation. Please drop us a line if you
missed a paper, and we will be more than glad to send it to
you.

The letters we have already received concerning the cir-
culation problem were greatly appreciated, and helped us in
straightening out a seemingly hopeless confusion.

Thank you for understanding our position during the
Ring-tum Phi “crisis,” and if we can be of any assistance in the
the future don’t hesitate to write us.

Business Staff, Ring-tum Phi

 

Academic Rise
Of University
Is Analyzed

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor

Of all the recent topics of con-
versation concerning W&L, perhaps
the most discussed is the so-called
“changing face” of the college. In-
deed, this topic has been given so
much lip-service and so niuch news-
paper space that it has become
a rather tired cliche.

Change is essential to freshness,
however, and it is the academic
change which has occurred, most
notably in the past four years, which
deserves our attention. Admissions
officers have boasted each year for
the past three years that each fresh-
man class is smarter and better pre-
pared than was the one before it.

This statement is true, for college
board scores, though they have not
risen phenomenally, have gone up
steadily each year. Freshmen are
coming to W&L today better pre-
pared and with somewhat higher
aptitude, and the improvement
along this line has fostered much
of the change which has taken place
all along the gallery of Washington
and Lee customs.

Fewer Dropouts

Another remarkable thing is that
fewer students are dropping out of
W&L than ever before. Last year
there were not near so many stu-
dents who found they could not take
the academic rigors of the college
as there were four years ago.

Especially gifted students are en-
hanced to remain at W&L for many
seasons, which have been inaugurated
into the college’s curriculum in only
the past few years: placement tests
which give advanced freshmen a
chance to begin courses on a sopho-
more level, opportunities for R. E.
Lee research grants, new majors in
sociology and contemporary civili-
zation, a new science building, a
renewed interest in debating, the
availability of sufficient loans to
able students who run into finan-
cial difficulty mid-way through
W&L, and the stepped-up program
of personal counseling made possible
by Dr. Sprunt’s work as Assistant
Dean of Students.

More Graduates

The result of all this is shown by
the fact that more and more men
who come to W&L as freshmen are
staying the entire four years and
graduating as seniors. The seniors
whom W&L graduates are better
prepared, it would seem, than ever
before, to cope with the complex-
ities of society. Students take dif-
ficult courses today where five years
ago they would have chosen the
easier ones just for the sure grade.

It is interesting to compare grades
themselves as given to the student
body in the spring semester of 1956
and those given last spring. Six years
ago the percentage of A’s given was
12.92, as compared with 11.87 last
year. A full percentage point dif-
ference, though difficult to correctly
analyze, may indicate that students
today are demanding, and getting,
more difficult subject matter with
which to deal, and that the realm
of excellence has drifted higher.

Grades Similar

The number of B’s given in the
two year’s was identical, but there
was a sharp rise of 3 per cent more
C’s given last spring than there
were in 1956. The reason for this
is that there were many more E’s
ana F’s given in 1956. than last year.
Last spring, 2.53 per cent of the total
grades given were F’s, and in 1956,
3.33 per cent were F’s. The number
of D’s given, however, is identical
for the two years—10.53 per cent of
the total grades given both years.

The most striking thing is the
lack of difference shown in these
statistics. Grades given in 1956 and
in 1962 were almost identical, with
the only difference coming in the
number of low grades received.

Next week a more detailed anal-
ysis of the growing intellectual
enthusiasm at W&L will be made,
including comments from professors,
and deans, and supporting figures
from University records.

Men of Achievement

 

Alumni of Washington and Lee:
A Compliment to the University

By TRACY HARRINGTON |

There’s something special about
being a Washington and Lee student.
For four years, all of us feel a kind
of kindred spirit with 1,000 other
men of the University.

But what about after that four
years? Is there anything “special”
about W&L alumni?

According to facts we have been
able to obtain, there is something
very special about W&L alumni—
and it might be summed up in the
single word “success.”

Because all of us will be (hope-
fully) Washington and Lee alumni
for a much longer time than we are
students here, the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi is beginning with this edition
a series of articles on noted alumni.

As a starter, a few statistics are
in order:

Five ABA Presidents

There have been five Presidents
of the American Bar Association
who graduated from Washington
and Lee. As far as we can find out,

that record is Harvard.

At the present time, there are at
least five college presidents among
our alumni, and possibly one more.

Six Rhodes scholars have come
from Washington and Lee.

Three of the seven justices of the
Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals
are W&L alumni, as are three past
justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.

There are presently seven bank
presidents (at least) among W&L
graduates, as well as vice presidents
of the Pullman Company (recently

deceased), Scott Paper Company,
and the National Broadcasting
Company.

And the present governor of West
Viirginia.

Among the present board of trus-
tees of the University, there are
11 of the fifteen members in Who's
Who.

Three board members are Phi
Beta Kappa key holders, eight
earned advanced degrees, seven hold
law degrees, eight are entitled to be
called doctors, either by honorary
degree or regular academic achieve-
ment, and one is an ex-governor.

A Few of the Best

As an introduction to the out-
standing alumni of Washington and
Lee, the Ring-tum Phi staff has
picked just a few men we feel are
representative.

The list is not intended to be
all inclusive, or in any order of
importance. The men were chosen at
random, and will serve our purpose
of pointing out the large number
of successful persons who are alum-
ni of Washington and Lee.

Among the top graduates of W&L
are:

Daniel Blain, Sr., class of 1921,

New Dictionary
Based On Usage,

Not Correctness

By BOB PATTON

How many times have you written
good quizzes and papers only to
have your grade docked for using
common, every day evpressions?

When you use words _ such
as “corny,” “wise guy, “hepped
up,” or “ants in his pants,’ your
teacher grumbled about your form-
al education and promptly racked
your grade a few notches.

How many times hove you wished
for a common man’s dictionary to
shove in your teacher's face and
say, “Here it is sir, this word is in
the dictionary. You’re wrong; I'm
right.”

Dr. Fitzgerald Flournoy Washing-
ton and Lee English professor dis-
cused such a dictionary at Mary
Baldwin College over the weekend.
The dictionary is the Webster's
Third International Dictionary, un-
abridged.

In this new kind of dictionary,
common usage determines whether
a word is acceptable or not. Dr.
Flournoy said that the New Web-
ster’s Third sparingly uses the labels
“colloquial” and “slang.”

According to Dr. Flournoy, the
editors of the New Webster Third
felt that what one man says is as
good as the next, and no one small
body of elite scholars has the right
to determine what is or is not ac-
cepted standard English.

It is interesting to predict what
effect this dictionary may have on
English usage. Students could start
using this dictionary to justify the
usage of certain words and grammar.

In addition to Shakespeare and
other notables of the language field
Dr. Flournoy said Wegster’s Third
quotes as authorities such per-
sonalities as Billy Rose, a notor-
ious night club owner; the St.
Petersburg Independent; TV person-
ality Art Linkletter; Bennet Cerf;
and United States senators to illus-
trate the validity of a word’s accept-
ance as standard English.

As long as a word is used fre-

quently in speaking, you can—ac-
cording to Webster's Third—use it in
writing.
To exemplify what can be stated
correctly using Webster’s Third as a
guide, the New York Times pub-
lished the following:

A passel of double-domes at the
G. and C. Merrian Company joint
in Springfield, Massachusetts, have
been confabbing and quakking for
27 years which is not intended to
infer that they have not been
doing plenty of work and now they
finalize Webster's New Interna-
tional Dictionary, Unabridged, a
new edition of that swell and es-
teemed book.

How does the dictionary
some of its words? A passel is “a
large number of low heads.” Double-

‘Inherit the Wind’ Loosened
Buckle On The ‘Bible Belt’

By C. C. FLIPPEN

The buckle on the Bible belt was
undone at the Troubadour Theatre
last week.

For a few hours the Bible-eating
citizens of Hillsboro, Tenn., had
their minds open and a little oil
from the lamp of truth forceably
poured in. Most of them didn’t like
the feel of rusty gears stirring.

A little of that oil might have
spilled over into the receptive au-
dience who saw the Troubs per-
form “Inherit the Wind” here.

The cast for the humorously poig-
nant play was well chosen.

Tim Morton, as Henry Drummond,
lawyer for the defense, dominated
the stage. With his head darting
in and out like a hungry chicken,
he constantly pecked away at the
ingrained dogma of the community.
Morton's ability to create characters
of depth and believability mark him
a top amateur actor.

As Matthew Harrison Brady, Gay
Reading has attempted to create a
role of a brilliant old man who
forgot the world and its ideas are
constantly in motion. For the most
part Reading has done a good job.
But the slight vocal affectation he
adopted in this role tended to affect
belief in his character.

John Dunnell as the sharp-tongued |
journalist Hornbeck has also done’

 

an effective job. He remained a bit-
ing cynic from start to finish. How-
ever, the authors leave him a much
more unpalatable character at the
end than we first thought him.

The supporting players were on
the whole adequate. Standout
among them was Bob Aylin as
Howard. His creation of an amus-
ing 13-year-old boy was very well
received.

Cates by Nick Denton, Rachel by
Ellen Barrett, Rev. Brown by Phil
Booth and Meeker by Andy Leonard
were also rather well done.

On the whole the production, di-
rected by Dr. Cecil Jones, was
very good. Occasionally in the early
scenes some lines seemed to be
rushed. Particularly noticeable was
an early crowd scene where the
eadence of line delivery sounded
distinctly like the clickty-clack train
ride song in “Music Man.”

Direction of the crowd scenes was
excellent. That so many people could
be worked well on the none-too-
large Troub stage is noteworthy.
When one considers that even this
area was lessened by having the
stage split into two separate act-
ing areas, it becomes almost astound-
ing.

Set and prop design were also
handled most effectively. The two-
level stage proved an integral part
of the show.

Generals Slip Past Centre, 38-22; Will Sewanee Be Next?

Kentucky Boys Shine At Home

   

Sewanee’s Tigers are stalking for their favorite
dish—raw General.

The Tigers from Tennessee invade Wilson Field
this Saturday with two purposes in mind: beat Wash-
ington and Lee and win the College Athletic Confer-
ence championship.

Some people thought Sewanee would be looking
ahead to this Saturday’s clash with W&L when they
met Southwestern last Saturday. If the Tigers were
dreaming of a feast and a plush throne room, Wash-
ington and Lee had better watch out .

Not only did Sewanee post its fourth win in six
games but it also ran up its biggest points spread of
the season—44-0.

Sewanee, led by junior tailback M. L. Agnew, had
trouble with Centre two weeks ago, posting a 28-6
win, but Southwestern seemed like easy pickings for
the hungry Tigers.

; = Tigers Sharpen Their Claws|
In Preparation For Clash With WGL |

Through the games of October 27 Agnew led the
conference in rushing (390 yards) and passing (320
yards), and total offense (710 yards) and was third
in scoring with 26 points.

Washington and Lee’s Tommy Keesee had second
in rushing (364 yards) and second in total offense
(391 yards).

Washington and Lee, launching its
drive to the College Athletic Confer-
ence title, wobbled by Centre Col-

lege, 38-22, Saturday at Danville,
Ky.
The Generals, obviously _ tired

from a 14-hour bus trip, looked slop-
py on offense, but still managed six
touchdowns, 371 yards rushing, and
46 yards passing.

Centre put on a surprising show
for a winless team and would have
made the score much closer had not
halfback Bill David intercepted a
Bill Hourigan pass on the Washing-
ton and Lee 10 as the game ended.

Although he did not score a touch-
down, Halfback Stu Yoffe led the
Generals’ ground attack with 151
yards in 10 carries. Quarterback
Chuck Lane picked up 60 yards in
11 tries, halfback Skip Chase dashed
for 55 yards in eight runs and
fullback Tommy Keesee earned 31
yards in eight attempts.

Washington and Lee drove 57 and
74 yards for tallies in the first two
times it had the football, but Centre

GLOOM AT THE TOP

Oh, sure, you’ve been busy, what with going to classes, doing
your homework, catching night crawlers, getting married —
but can’t you pause for just a moment and give thought to that
dear, dedicated, lonely man in the big white house on the hill?
I refer, of course, to the Prexy.

(It is interesting to note here that college presidents are al-
ways called “Prexy.” Similarly, trustees are called ‘“Trixie.”
Associate professors are called “Axy-Pixy.” Bursars are called
“Foxy-Woxy.” Students are called “Algae.’’)

But I digress. We were speaking of the Prexy, a personage at
once august and pathetic. Why pathetic? Well sir, consider how
Prexy spends his days. He is busy, busy, busy. He talks to
deans, he talks to professors, he talks to trusteees, he talks to
alumni. In fact, he talks to everybody except the one group
who could lift his heart and rally his spirits. I mean, of course,
the appealingest, endearingest, winsomest group in the entire
college—you, the students.

It is the Prexy’s sad fate to be forever a stranger to your
laughing, golden selves. He can only gaze wistfully out the
window of his big white house on the hill and watch you at your
games and sports and yearn with all his tormented heart to bask
in your warmth. But how? It would hardly be fitting for Prexy
to appear one day at the Union, clad in an old rowing blazer,
and ery gaily, ‘““Heigh-ho, chaps! Who’s for sculling?”

 

No, friends, Prexy can’t get to you. It is up to you to get to
him. Call on him at home. Just drop in unannounced. He will
naturally be a little shy at first, so you must put him at his
ease. Shout, ‘‘Howdy-doody, sir! I have come to bring a little
sunshine into your drear and blighted life!’ Then yank his
necktie out of his vest and scamper goatlike around him until
he is laughing merrily along with you.

Then hand him a package and say, “A little gift for you, sir.”

“For me?’’ he will say, lowering his lids. “You shouldn’t
have.”

“Yes, I should,” you will say, “because this package is
a carton of Marlboro Cigarettes, and whenever I think of
Marlboro, I think of you.”

“Why, hey?” he will say curiously.

“Because Marlboros have taste, and so do you,”
reply.

“Aw, go on,” he will say, blushing furiously.

“Tt’s true,” you will say. “Moreover, Marlboro has a filter,
and so do you.”

“In my swimming pool, you mean,”

Yes,” you will say. “
and so do you.”

“My limp leather brief case, you mean,”

“Yes,” you will say. ‘‘Moreover, the
flip-top, and so do you.”

“But I don’t have a flip-top,” he will say.
“But you will,” you will say. “Just light a Marlboro, and
taste that tasty taste, and you will surely flip your top.”

Well sir, you will have many a good chuckle about that, you
may be sure. Then you will say, ‘Goodbye, sir, I will return
soon again to brighten your lorn and desperate life.”’

“Please do,” he will say. “But next time, if you can possibly
manage it, try not to come at four in the morning.”
