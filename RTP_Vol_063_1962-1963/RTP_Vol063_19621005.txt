Alumni And Parents’ Weekends
Expected To Break Records

By JULIAN MARKHAM

The University sponsored Alum-
ni and Parents Weekends, of Oc-
tober 19-20 and October
respectively, are being met with un-
precedented interest. Intensive plan-
ning now under way should insure
the success of these annual events
for campus visitors.

This year’s Homecoming and Op-
enings Dance weekend will be com-
bined with an alumni gathering of
“considerable extent,” Mr. Wash-
burn, Alumni Director, announced
today.

450 Reservations

Mr. Washburn said that he had
450 requests for reservations to
date—making this year’s fall Alum-

ni weekend the largest in recent
years. Citing this unusually good

representation, Mr. Washburn stat-

| ed that his office was making every

The program of events for the
Alumni includes: the annual Al-

urday schedule for the Alumni
will be highlighted by tours of

Capitalizing on the scheduling
of the Alumni Weekend with Home-
coming and Opening Dances, the
Alumni Office will offer prizes to
the four fraternities having the
best Homecoming decorations. The
decorations will be judged by an
impartial committee of alumni, fac-
ulty, and local residents. It is hoped
that the fraternity decorations will
greatly enhance the festive atmos-
phere of the weekend. Also in the
attempt to stimulate alumni inter-
est, the Homecoming Queen selec-
tion will vary somewhat from past
practices this year. Each fraterni-
ty’s Homecoming Queen candidate
will be presented in
Dance figure. The crowning of the
Queen is scheduled for half-time at
Saturday’s game.

THE RING-

TUM PHI

 

A REPORT FROM OLE MISS

By JOE MURPHEY
Friday Correspondent

(Ed. Note—The following article
was written by Joe Murphey, who
graduated from W&L last year and
is now a graduate student in geol-
ogy at the University of Mississippi.
The text of this article was written
on Tuesday.)

No one knew just when, where,
or in what form the showdown
would come here. It was expected
soon, probably before the day was
over. Meredith was reported “on
the way” by several different means
of transportation. Actually no one
knew just how he was coming, but
only that he was “on the way.” The
day was Thursday, the 27th of Sep-
tember. A large crowd of students
had gathered along University Ave-
enue leading to the main entrance
(where Meredith was supposed to
be ushered onto the campus by
marshals.)

“

For a town potentially on the
brink of violence or bloodshed,
this tiny university community
(two movies, one drive-in) was
remarkably peaceful and at ease.
But fer a few roaring “hoddy-
toddies” occasionally, there was no
evidence of the tension that was
mounting. Everyone carried on as
if he was unaware of the serious-
ness of the problem.

Signs boosting homecoming queen
candidates sprouted all over the
campus, the same campus that has
produced two Miss Americas since
1959. Freshmen men sported shaved
heads and blue and red _ beanies.
They talked of nothing but Ole Miss’
football game with Kentucky sched-
uled for Saturday night. Students in
the corridors of Mississippi’s red

afternoon. |

Then any similarity to any other |
football weekend ended. What!
awaited the students was enough to |
shock them into utter disbelief for
two or three hours. The Lyceum |
building was completely surround- |
ed by deputy U.S. marshals. The |
suddenness and brashness of the|
move was a mistake. Many more
were to come.

The students could not under-|
stand what the marshals thought |
they were doing. They had encir-|
cled, in full riot gear, a completely |
empty building, protecting no one
(Meredith had been placed on cam-
pus by helicopter almost a quarter of
a mile from the Lyceum building.)
Supposedly, they were holding the
fort for Monday’s registration cere-
monies.

They should have picked a less
historic building, for this is the
oldest building on the campus and
has been the center of Ole Miss
activity since 1848 when it was
completed. It held sentimental
value for most of the students,
and they thought that the mere
presence of Federal men on its
premises constituted a desecra-
tion unequalled since General
Grant rode his horse through its
halls nearly a century ago.

The students started out Sunday
afternoon by shouting slogans of
their pride in Mississippi and ended
up with very little to be proud of.
The restraint and simple boisterous-
ness that had marked most of the
demonstrations in the Meredith sit-
uation degenerated into unrestrain-
ed hatred and violence. Before the
rioting ended, scores were injured,

some very critically, and at least
two men were dead. Police said that
Paul Guihard, a French reporter,
had a puncture wound in his back.
The “puncture” later proved to be
from a .38 caliber bullet. The sec-
ond fatality was a 23-year old stu-
dent, a native of Oxford, who was

brick buildings shrugged off ques-
tions about Meredith’s possible re-
entry (he had already been turned
away from Ole Miss three times.)
They thought of the possibility of
another attempt; but since over 200
Mississippi Highway Patrol cars
were on campus, they didn’t worry

 

killed by a shotgun blast in the
back of his head.

The whole affair had started out
like a circus sideshow, with about
175 Federal marshals the center of
attraction. The crowds of curious
onlookers displayed signs saying
“Yankee Go Home” and Confederate
flags. As the white-helmeted marsh-
als armed with tear gas guns ringed
the Lyceum, the crowd began to
jeer. Cries of “Why don’t you go to
Cuba?” “Nigger lovers,’ and “goon
squad” gang out. Then the taunt-
ing began with intensive force. Stu-
dents also shouted “Why aren’t you
integrated? I don’t see any nigger
marshals.” The crowd began to sing
“Micky Mouse” to their tormen-
tors.

about it.

When it was learned that Mere-
dith had turned back, everyone
cheered the fourth victory of the
highway patrol and returned to
their fraternities, sororities, dorms,
etc. Everyone seemed to think the
battle had been recessed for the dur-
ation of the weekend and expected
it to resume on Monday. At any rate,
Ole Miss traditionally begins its vic-
tory celebrations on Thursday night,
and no one seemed to think this
weekend was any different from the
rest.

In many ways it was not differ-
ent. Ole Miss trounced its oppon-
ent on the gridiron, the victory
party was held in the Heidle-
burg Hotel in Jackson, and the
most of the student body got back

Change For The Sake Of Change?

The past few weeks have seen new efforts to revise our
present rush system. The IFC was presented with a plan that
would delay rush until after S&U reports. This is the same
plan that was presented to and defeated by the IFC last year.

It is our feeling that there are some who wish a change—

 

Then came the second mistake.

 

 

any change—just for the sake of change. True, our present
system has its faults. However, the advantages of our system by
far outweigh the disadvantages.

There are those who contend that the freshmen meet
the fraternities before they are introduced to the University.
This is not wholly true. Freshman Camp has long served as
a means of introducing freshmen to the University. Futher-
more, our freshmen should be mature enough to make their
own decisions regarding fraternities and the University. After
all, this is not a prep school, where all your thinking is done
for you.

True, a freshman lives like a king for five days before he
opens his first book. However, with this behind him, he can
settle down to work. Nothing is disrupted and the freshman
has the opportunity to meet his university in a more relaxed
atmosphere.

If we were to adopt a delayed rush system, many of the
present problems would be compounded. The freshmen as well
as upperclassmen would have a whole month in which to antici-
pate rush. This could be very distracting. In addition, classes
would be disrupted at a time when things have just settled
down. This would cause far more problems than in the early
days of the semester when nothing of real consequence is hap-
pening.

It is our hope that our present rush system will be main-
tained and improved. The IFC should exhaust all possibilities
of improving our present system before seeking a new pro-

 

gram. A change is not always the best solution toa problem.

One of the drivers of a truck full
of relief marshals was a Negro.
The mood of the crowd instantly
grew ugly. It was about 7:00 p.m.
and most of the students had fin-
ished dinner and were congregat-
ing around the Lyceum again. |
Some had brought rolls and cus-
tard and cream pies to “feed the
hungry marshals.” More and more
derisive remarks were shouted
and then lighted cigarettes were
thrown at the driver and then at
the marshals.

A Movietone photographer who)
took pictures of the crowd was|
mobbed as he got back into his ie |
As he and a woman reporter sat in-|
side, both students and outsiders
smashed the windows and bashed in

|
the top of the car. They also at-|
tempted to turn the vehicle over. |
The reporter’s camera was snatched |
and dashed to the street. The oc-|
cupants were assisted from the car |
by highway patrolmen and _ taken
away in a squad car. The crowd
then continued their destruction of |
the car.

 

After this the mob got increasing- |
ly out of hand. The violence was |
mostly away from the marshals|
since a protective ring of highway
patrolmen were around them. The
crowd would listen to the state po-
lice and would back away from the
marshals when the state troopers
asked them to to so.

The vastly outnumbered cam-
pus police tried to instill a lit-
tle order but were largely unsuc-
cessful. As vandalism toward the
government trucks broke out,
state patrolmen were overheard
saying. “There’s nothing we can
do; we don’t have any authority

 

anymore.” Earlier in the day Gov.
Ross Barnett had announced that
the Federal government had fed-
eralized the campus and_ that
whatever happened was their re-
sponsibility.

Then the wrath of the mob fo-
cused on the trucks which the mar-
shals had arrived in earlier and|
which remained parked in front of |
the Lyceum building. More cigaret- |

|
|
|
|
|

| tes were thrown and the canvas top |
}on one of the trucks caught fire |
| Rocks were thrown at the trucks, |

breaking some of the windows. The
signs saying “Help Ross Keep Mis- |
sissippi Sovereign” which had been |
placed in all students rooms a day |
or so earlier by some mysterious |
donor began to be plastered all over |
the trucks. One homemade sign read |
“Join the Army and See the Old!
Miss Campus” Suddenly the mar-|
shals fired point-blank into the
crowd. Four of the Mississippi high-
way patrolmen were hit in the back
by the huge cannisters of tear gas.
Two more were hit in the face. The
crowd dispersed.

The marshals soon decided to
clear out the whole area at once.
They then charged, firing the can-
nisters of tear gas straight at crowds
gathered as little as one hundred
yards away. Many of these crowds
were coeds, merely curious and not
participating in the demonstrations
or riots. One of the tear gas bombs

groups and hit a girl squarely in
the chest, just inches below her col-
larbone.

Four male students near her at-
tempted to rescue her when she
was knocked to the ground by the
bomb. They were carrying her

 

out of the fumes when two mar-
shals came up with billy clubs
and began to shout at and _ hit
them. They told them to leave
the girl, that they would take care
of her. The boys complied and one
of the marshals picked her up and
carried her straight back into the
heavy fumes of gas and smoke.
The fifty or so students standing
by heard and saw all of this. This,
more than anything else, incen-
sed the crowd. Everyone was now
at a fever pitch.

The marshals realizing what they
had started, called for reinforce-
ments. One moving van full of tear
gas arrived. It was bombarded by
bricks to such an extent that the
driver could hardly see through the
shattered windshield. Any vehicle
with an out-of-state license plate
or without an Ole Miss sticker was
as good as wrecked. Highway pa-
trolmen had to escort the ambu-
lances and doctors through the
crowd. This was about the only
function left which the troopers
could perform.

The injured girl and the highway |

patrolman that had been struck by
the tear gas projectiles were car-
ried away safely. The girl and two
of the patrolmen are still hospital-
ized,

hope it’s not about the draft.”)

“Hello sir? Well, I’m mentaly ill
as usual sir. And you?” And the
conversation droned on as I tried to}
size this man up.

The call was from the Chairman |
of the Arts Department at Prince- |
ton, checking up on our new faculty |
member’s recent research in Rome. |

My Work or La Dolce Vita
After hanging up, Mr. Shirey |
turned to me with his ingratiating
grin. “So you want to do an article
about me? Should I be confidential
or not?”
“Well, sir, suppose we start with
your trip to Rome.”
“You mean my
la dolce vita?”
Immediately I could see my inter-
view taking on bright prospects. |
Working on his Ph.D. for |
Princeton, Mr. Shirey has been |
studying at the French Academy |

work there or |

in Rome. Supported by a Ful-
bright Scholarship and Italian
Government Grants, he has done |
research on the 18th Century Ital-
ian artist, Hubert Robert.

“My work has included a study
of Robert’s contemporaries and the
influence which they had in the de-
velopment of the great painter’s
style,’ Mr. Shirey explained.

In addition to his Ph.D. work Mr.
Shirey found time to play minor
roles in several Italian mov-
ies. Also on his list of varied activi-
ties, he taught art to small, private
groups in Rome and lectured for two

 

weeks to American students in Lux-
embourg.

National Spelling Bee Champion
Mr. Shirey’s colorful scholastic
career has left a continuous record |
of exceptional ability. As a youth,
he won the championship for the
National Spelling Bee contest. He
was also winner of an English con-
test in his home state, Ohio.

As an undergraduate at Princeton
(Class of ’58), Mr. Shirey was both
a pre-med and an art history ma-
jor. “My primary interest was in
becoming a doctor,” he recalls, “but
Princeton believed in the ‘humanis-
tic’ type of eduction and made me
take a liberal major also.”

He become more and more in-
terested in his art courses and less
so in medicine. One evidence of
promise in his new field was his
discovery that art critics had at-
tributed a painting to the wrong
artist. A large museum in New
York City contracted young Shir-
ey to lecture on the methods by

 

which he had discovered the true
artist,

Mr. Shirey spent two years of his

| undergraduate work at L’Ecole des

Beaux Arts He developed such a
fondness for la vie de France that
he made several return visits dur-
ing summers as a waiter for vari-
ous French hotels.

“I was anxious to learn the fine art
of French cooking,’ he continued.
“Still, I manage to spill food over
everybody and make a general mess
of it all.”

Mr. Shirey also spent several
summers in Greece as a “pleasure
tourist.” He further recalls some
hair-raising expeditions alone the
southern Mediterranean and_ the
Nile.

In his extensive travels, he has
picked up a fluent knowledge of
languages. “I speak French, Italian,
and Spanish,” he said, “and a little
English.”

Mr. Shirey now has charge of the

Concrete posts and road
were uprooted, broken into bits, and
used on the marshals. Pop bottles

“empty” stands at service stations
all over town. The rioters even
broke the overhanging of the flag-
stone steps of the engineering build-
ing and used that for ammunition,

markers

The mob broke into the chem-
istry-pharmacy building and stole
bottles of acid and threw them at
the marshals. What the marshals
had started by a few shots of tear
gas was not as easy to halt as they
imagined. They resorted to brutal-
ity.

One 19-year od boy was caught
by two marshals who beat him to
the ground with their sticks, stood
on his shoulders, then dropped a
tear gas grenade on his head and
held him there until he passed out
from the fumes.

A bulldozer was cranked
the students, the blade was raised
to shield the driver, and then it
was used to plow through a half
dozen cars which were parked in
such a way that they shielded the
marshals.

Ex-Maj. Gen. Edwin Walker
who commanded the troops at Lit-
tle Rock, led some student at-
tacks on the Lyceum building
early in the melee and later tried
to persuade them to stop. The
students booed him when he
changed his stand.

His classroom idiosyncrasies in-

lectures. He is also addicted to a
pair of dark glasses, which he man-
ages to see through even when the
lights are dimmed for slides. (“They
are a gift to me and the only pair I
can afford.”)

In commenting on his teaching
policy, Mr. Shirey explained that he
had no intention of giving any “gut”
courses, “On the other hand,” he ad-
ded, “I see no sense in swamping
students with complex theories and
symbolisms. What I am aiming at is
to instill in them a stylistic sensi-
tivity about works of art.”

Mr. Shirey’s classes are waiting in
supreme suspense to see just how

The Washington and Lee soccer
team dropped a 3-0 decision to the
Fort Lee Travelers here Wednesday.

Fort Lee is a U.S. Army team
whose players spoke little English
but played an aggressive game of
soccer.

The visitors broke into the scoring
column midway through the first
period as Jim O’Neill, the center
forward, booted a cross from the
right wing into the net.

Washington and Lee’s hustling ball
club, led by Co-Captains Clements
and Pagano, held off the opposition
and controlled the ball fairly well
until the middle of the fourth period
when the Generals’ defense began
to lag.

The Travelers’ fourth period
scores came within three minutes
of each other. Their second tally
of the day was rung up by right
wing Mario Pusaterio and _ their
third score was executed by Gus
Siapkaris.

Fort Lee Drops W&L Soccer;
General Record Even At 1-1

The Generals displayed an excel-

jlent team effort throughout the
| game. The 3-0 score is not very rep-

resentative of the hustle and or-
ganized play which the Generals
displayed as the breaks seemed to
be against them.

Two Injuries for W&L

One bad break for the Generals
was the temporary loss of Bruce
Jackson and Bob Pagano who were
out for a while with minor injuries,
but later returned to the game.

Particularly fine performances
were turned in by freshman half-
back Tim Henry, right wing Steve
Hibbard, and fullbacks Tom Clem-
ents and Eben Warner.

Look To End
WEL Streak

By AL JOHNSTON
Staff Reporter

The Generals will try to raise

' their total to 22 undefeated games
' when they meet Emory and Henry

College in Emory, Virginia, tomor-

' row afternoon.

As was the case last year, it

| seems that this will be their most
, challenging game of the season.

The Wasps have many of last

| year’s starters back this season.
' Their line is big and rugged, and

is backed up by a swift, aggressive

“a backfield.

Right halfback and
sophomore Bob Magill, of the
Wasps, is very fast and will be
difficult to stop.

Bob Hawkins, the other starting
halfback, can run and pass and
therefore will be a constant threat
to the General defense.

Rounding out Emory and Henry’s
backfield is Ron Burton, a heavy
fullback with good speed.

Coach McLaughlin’s Generals are
quite aware of what they will be
up against and have been working
all week.

Yoffe May Be Out Again

There is a_ possibility that Stu
Yoffe, the Generals’ starting half-
back, will not play because of an
injury incurred during practice last
week.

Lineman Jim Sylvester, who was
hurt early in pre-season practice,
has regained his pre-injury form
and will return to the lineup Sat-
urday.

starting

It is hoped that the passing com-
bination of quarterback Chuck
Lane and sophomore halfback Bill

David will click as well as in pre- |

vious games.

Two of W&L’s linemen,
Sheffey and Bob Payne, have also
turned in outstanding performances
in this year’s contests. Such talent

will be a greatly needed asset for |

the Generals this weekend.

ANOTHER YEAR, ANOTHER DOLLAR

With today’s entry I begin my ninth year of writing columns
in your school newspaper for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes.

Nine years, I believe you will agree, is a long time. In fact,
it took only a little longer than nine years to dig the Suez
Canal, and you know what a gigantic undertaking that was!
To be sure, the work would have gone more rapidly had the
shovel been invented at that time, but, as we all know, the
shovel was not invented until 1946 by Walter R. Shovel of
Cleveland, Ohio. Before Mr. Shovel’s discovery in 1946, all
digging was done with sugar tongs—a method unquestionably
dainty but hardly what one would call rapid. There were, natu-
rally, many efforts made to speed up digging before Mr. Shovel’s
breakthrough—notably an attempt in 1912 by the immortal
Thomas Alva Edison to dig with the phonograph, but the only
thing that happened was that he got his horn full of sand. This
so depressed Mr. Edison that he fell into a fit of melancholy
from which he did not emerge until two years later when his
friend William Wordsworth, the eminent nature poet, cheered
him up by imitating a duck for four and a half hours.

But I digress. For nine years, I say, I have been writing this
column for the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, and for nine
years they have been paying me money. You are shocked. You
think that anyone who has tasted Marlboro’s unparalleled
flavor, who has enjoyed Marlboro’s filter, who has revelled in
Marlboro’s jolly red and white pack or box should be more than
willing to write about Marlboro without a penny’s compensa-
tion. You are wrong.

Compensation is the very foundation stone of the American
Way of Life. Whether you love your work or hate it, our system
absolutely requires that you be paid for it. For example, I
have a friend named Rex Glebe, a veterinarian by profession,
who simply adores to worm dogs. I mean you can call him up
and say, ‘Hey, Rex, let’s go bowl a few lines,” or “Hey, Rex,
let’s go flatten some pennies on the railroad tracks,’ and he
will always reply, “No, thanks. I better stay here in case

somebody wants a dog wormed.” I mean there is not one thing
in the whole world you can name that Rex likes better than
worming a dog. But even so, Rex always sends a bill for worm-
ing your dog because in his wisdom he knows that to do other-
wise would be to rend, possibly irreparably, the fabric of
democracy.

 

It’s the same with me and Marlboro Cigarettes. I think
Marlboro’s flavor represents the pinnacle of the tobacconist’s
art. I think Marlboro’s filter represents the pinnacle of the
filter-maker’s art. I think Marlboro’s pack and box represent
the pinnacle of the packager’s art. I think Marlboro is a pleas-
ure and a treasure, and I fairly burst with pride that I have
been chosen to speak for Marlboro on your campus. All the
same, I want my money every week. And the makers of
Marlboro understand this full well. They don’t like it, but they
understand it.

In the columns which follow this opening installment, T will
turn the hot white light of truth on the pressing problems of
campus life—the many and varied dilemmas which beset the
undergraduate—burning questions like “Should Chaucer class-
rooms be converted to parking garages?” and “Should proctors
be given a saliva test?” and “Should foreign exchange students
be held for ransom?”

And in these columns, while grappling with the crises that
vex campus America, I will make occasional brief mention of
Marlboro Cigarettes. If I do not, the makers will not give me
any money. © 1962 Max Shuiman

The makers o: Marlboro will bring you this uncensored,
free-style column 26 times throughout the school year. Dur-
ing this period it is not unlikely that Old Max will step on
some toes—principally ours—but we think it’s allin fun and
we hope you will too.

Reflections of Telstar

ture above? It flashed across your

television screen on a hot night last July. Perhaps
you remember that it originated from France. And
that it reached the U.S. via Telstar, the world’s first

private enterprise

communications satellite.

Since that summer night, the Bell System's Telstar

has relayed electr

onic signals of many types —tele-

vision broadcasts, telephone calls, news photographs,

and others.

But there’s one Telstar reflection you might have
missed, Look into the faces of the Bell System people
below and you'll see it. It is the reflection of Telstar’s

success that glowed brightly on the faces of all who
