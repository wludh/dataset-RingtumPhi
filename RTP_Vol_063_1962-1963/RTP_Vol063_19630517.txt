EC Appoints Sharp

To Plan Convention

Intermediate Law Student To Head
Colorful Mock Political Convention

By DAVID MARCHESE
Staff Reporter

The Executive Committee recently
appointed Philip D. Sharp, Jr., an
intermediate law student, as chair-
man of the 1964 Mock Convention.
This is the thirteenth political con-
vention staged by Washington and
Lee students since 1908. The general
purpose of the convention is an at-
tempt to guess the next presidential
candidate for the party out of office,
in this case, the Republican Party.

As the mock balloting is done
prior to the party’s summer national
convention, Sharp is planning a late
April or early May date for the
convention here.

A contributor to the Law Review,
Sharp is a 1962 graduate of Wash-

ington and Lee and a member of |

Who’s Who in American Colleges.

This year he has served as head |\

dorm councilor and was recently ap-
pointed to the Student Control Com-
mittee. Sharp is quoted as saying he
is deeply gratified for his selection
as chairman and hopes that with the
help of the entire student body, the
1964 convention will be the most
successful ever.

He plans to announce a Student

Next Year’s
Committees

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body met yesterday after-
noon in an Executive Session to

and Lee’s four major committees for
students.

Named as Chairman of the Student
Control Committee for 1963-64 was
Jim Sylvester, Kappa Sigma and un-
successful candidate for senior EC
in the recent class elections. The
law representative on the commit-
tee will be Bob Sykes, and the senior
representative Fred Schaffer, jun-
ior—Joe Wheeler, and sophomore
representative, Peter Kintz. Two
Committeemen at large were select:
ed Kemp Morton and Al Eckes.

Assimilation Committee members,
numbering nine in all, were also
chosen. Heading up the committee
will be Jim Maffit, and those serving
under him will be: Fred Cooper, Tom
Pace, Bill Surbaugh, Vic Galef, Greg
Euston, Mike Hayslip, Chuck Griffin,
and Chip Day.

The Cold Check Committee to be
headed by Barry Greene, will be
made up of the following students:
Mack Brownlee, Jim Slay, Shannon
Jung, Alex Taft, Drew Baur, and
Scott Kennedy.

Heading the Student Library Com-
mittee will be Steve Parel. Serving
as committee members will be: Tim
Dols, Mike Levin, Mel Lapes, Walter
Bennett, Tabor Novak, and Wes
Horner.

Controversy Develops Ove Firing Of Wolsiose
Students Claim Freedom Of Association Violated

One week ago today a waitress
employed by the Corner Grill at
the intersection of Lee Avenue and
W. Nelson Street was dscharged
and a W&L student Eric Berg, was
asked to remain off the premises
for the rest of his stay here.

Berg has stated that Doc, proprie-
tor of the Corner Grill, sent someone
to tell him, after he was seen con-
versing with three Negro girls across
the street, ‘that “you don’t do that
in the South.” The next afternoon,
Berg went into Doc’s, and while
talking with a waitress, asked her if
she thought Doc would object to his
telling his feelings about what had
happened the preceding day.

Argument Develops

While Berg was talking with the
waitress, Doe asked the waitress to
stand elsewhere behind the counter.
An argument followed between the
waitress and Doc, after which he
discharged her and asked Berg to
get out and stay out of his estab-
lishment.

and Lee students acquaint them-
selves with the political situation
since he feels that an awareness of
the issues and candidates involved
is necessary to be better prepared to
participate.

In 1960, with former President
Harry S. Truman giving the keynote
speech, Washington and Lee stu-

In 1956, the Washington and Lee
convention attracted nation-wide
attention when its keynote speaker,
Senator Alben W. Barkley, collapsed
and died of a heart attack at the
close of his keynote address at Dore-
mus Gymnasium. A plaque was
dedicated at the 1960 Convention in
memory of the Senator from Ken-
tucky.

The convention is exclusively a
student affair from its early planning
to its actual running. It lasts for two
days with a colorful opening parade
which features floats from the state
delegations, bands and marching
units. Another incentive that adds
to the political fervor is the suspen-
sion of University classes for the
two-day run of the Convention.

 

There will be a meeting of the
Publications Board Monday, May
20, at 5 p.m, in the Student Union.
It will be the last meeting for the
current year. Salaries must be
coted upon, and final votes taken
on measures brought up at the last

As a result of this event, a state-
ment that has been called a “spon-
taneous reaction of the student body
and faculty,” has been circulating
and has over 300 signatures. The

statement is a “voluntary” pledge
not to associate with the business
establishment run by Doc.

Doc Interviewed
In an interview last Monday with

Doc, he stated that the firing of
the waitress came as a result of

her spending too much time talk-
ing with customers, especially Berg,
and that it was not due to any other
reasons. He stated that his wife had
complained that Berg had talked
with the waitress for 45 minutes on
Thursday and that it was interferring
with her work. He stated that he did
not object to anything that went on
between the waitress and Berg out-
side the Grill, but that when she
was there he wanted her to work.

Doc did say that he remarked to
someone near the front of the Grill,
when he saw Eric talking to the

Waysiders To Sing June 4
In ‘Rooftop Singers’ Concert

By KEN McGRAW

Joining the “Rooftop Singers” for
a half hour performance in the Tues-
day night concert of Finals, will be
the “Waysiders” of Washington and
Lee University. The announcement
was made this week by Dance Board
President Frank Young.

The Waysiders, made up of Jim
Ledbetter, a Phi Gam sophomore
from Alexandria, and Dave Trussel,
a Phi Delt sophomore from Balti-
more, are a folksinging group mod-
eled somewhat after “Gibson and
Camp” and “Jan and Sylvia,” two
well known folksinging duos. The
songs which the Waysiders sing,
however, are original. Ledbetter has
written some of them himself.

Ledbetter and Trussel began sing-

ing together back in January. They
made their first appearances at the
College Inn, and since then have
proved to be very popular. In ad-
dition to singing at fraternity houses
and local girls’ schools, the Way-
siders have appeared at the Gaslight
in Roanoke, and at Le Flambeau and
The Blue Dog Cellar in Baltimore.
They plan to continue singing this
summer and already have engage-
ments in Ocean City, Philadelphia,
and Baltimore.

Before getting together as the
Waysiders, Ledbetter and Trussel
did a good bit of singing on their
own. Ledbetter sang with a group
last summer at The Shadows in
Georgetown, and Trussel was a
member of the Sazeracks.

colored girls across the street, that
“Somebody should tell him that you
don’t do that in the South.” Doc
also stated that he had heard ru-
mors that the colored people were

going to beat him (Eric) up and
that he (Doc) didn’t want any
trouble.

Freedom of Association

Eric and the signers of the state-
ment object to what they feel was
an attempt by Doe to interfere with
“freedom of association” as it was
used by Berg. They feel that the
firing of the waitress came to a great
extent because of Berg’s conversa-
tions with the Negro girls.

Doc, on the contrary, stated that
the sole reason for the girl's dis-
charge was her neglection of her
work. He stated that he has not
noticed any change in business as a
result of the statement. He added}
that his “business is students” and}
that “he would not do anything to |
hurt them.” \

150 Graduating Seniors At Banquet

See First Gilliam

By GARETH ADEN

The annual Senior Banquet was
held last Wednesday evening in the
Evans Dining Hall. About 150 grad-
uating seniors, members of the
Alumni Association, and guests were
on hand to see the presentation of
the first annual Frank J. Gilliam
Award, which went to Thomas
Rains.

The Gilliam Award was established
this February by the Executive
Committee to be given to a gradu-
ating senior “in recognition of out-
standing contribution to the school.”
It was indicated that Rains received
the award for his work as President
of the Student Control Committee.

The Giliiam Award consists of
$100 to the recipient and $150 to
be given to a campus organization
or department of the school as the
recipient is to indicate. Rains chose

 

W&L To Lose :
Three Profs
Next Year

By ROBERT POTTS
Several members of the Washing-
ton and Lee faculty have announced
that they will not be returning to
the University with the end of this
academic session.
Associate Professor of Political

Science Dr. Allen E. Ragan, who

came to W&L in 1946 from Tus-
culum College in Greenville, Ten-
nessee, is retiring at the age of sixty-
five. He will, however, continue to
teach at East Kentucky State Col-
lege in Richmond, Kentucky.

Dr. Ragan recently published an
article in the News Letter of U.Va.
on Virginia’s judicial system that
received recognition from the Execu-
tive Secretary of Virginia’s Supreme
Court of Appeals.

“T’ve enjoyed it and hate to leave
my many friends and colleagues,”
commented Dr. Ragan on his seven-
teen years at the University.

Professor Smith Leaving

Assistant Professor of History C.
O. Smith is leaving Washington and

|Lee and will be teaching modern

European History at Drexel Institute
of Technology in Philadelphia, Pa.
Mr. Smith stated that his stay here
had been rewarding in that, “I’ve
had enough good students to make
my efforts as a teacher worthwhile.”
Prior to coming to W&L, Mr. Smith
was an instructor at M.LT. in Hu-
manities.

Jay Laurence Taylor, Instructor
in Romance Languages, announced
that he would be returning to New
York University at the end of this
year. It was at N.Y.U. that Mr.
Taylor received his B.A. degree
which he followed up with graduate
studies at the University of Paris
and Vienna. “As a tenth generation
Virginian, it was fun to have finally
lived in Virginia,” he said, speaking
however, in only one of the twelve
languages at his command.

Award Presented

to have this money given to the
Department of English for use in
the Moffatt Seminar Room. The
money was awarded in the name of
Theodore Thompson, Jr., a recently
deceased fraternity brother of Rains,
and was received for the English
Department by Dr. Severn Duvall.

Dean Gilliam gave Rains the
award: a plaque and check. There
will also be a plaque hung in the
Student Union upon which will be
engraved the winners of the Gilliam
Award.

After the smorgasbord dinner, the
Sazeracs performed for about twenty
minutes and then Dr. Francis Gaines,
Chancellor of the University, be-
gan the program with an invoca-
tion.

President Fred C. Cole then gave
a short ten minute address to the
graduating seniors, pointing out the
fact that he had come to Washing-
ton and Lee at the same time they
had. He added that he had benefitted
a great deal from his associations

them all the best of luck in the
future.

Both Dave Montgomery and Paul
Boswell gave responses to President
Cole’s speech, thanking him for his
outstanding job of administrating
the school.

Next on the program was the
presentation of the Gilliam Award
and then Mr. William C. Washburn,
Executive Secretary of the Alumni
Association gave the seniors a short
sketch of the workings and purpose
of the Alumni Association.

Mr. Washburn, who is officially in
charge of the banquet and the Board
of Trustees of the Alumni Associa-
tion felt that the banquet was a
success in every way. In the past
these banquets have been held at
the Natural Bridge Hotel but the
banquet shifted to the Commons af-
ter fire burned down the Natural
Bridge Hotel a few weeks ago. Plans
for next year have not yet been
made.

As ‘A Search For The Holy Life’

Dr. Charles R. Anderson of The
Johns Hopkins University spoke here
last night on Henry David Thoreau
for the Seminars in Literature pro-
gram.

His lecture, titled “The Magic Cir-
cle of Walden,” will be the basis of a
book he intends to write in the near
future on the 19th century philoso-
pher and social critic.

Dr. Anderson approached Wal-
den as a large poem, giving at-
tention to its language structure,
and symbolism as well as_ its
thought. “The theme of Thoreau’s
masterpiece,” he stated, “is the
search for perfection and the holy
life—though this search is never
in Christian terms.

The structure was explained as
resembling a circle and a web. The
cirele is perfection, and is repre-
sented by many images; the cycle
of the seasons, the cycle of the
day, the flight of birds, and Walden
Pond itself—which is ringed by
other ponds. “There are many radial

 

spokes going out from the circle,”
Dr. Anderson explained; lines of
Thoreau’s wit which leads us from
the center, which man must escape
in finding himself.” The actual struc-
ture of the book was shown to sup-
port this; the chapter entitled “The
Pond,” which contains the heart
of Thoreau’s message, is placed in
the center of the book and is sur-
rounded by chapters that are de-
signed to lead to and away from it.

The most entertaining part of
Dr. Anderson’s lecture was con-
cerned with Thoreau’s wit, which
is often overlooked by the casual
reader. Thoreau was a master of
the pun and of cutting understate-
ment, which he used to render
arguments against his thought
meaningless. “Thoreau is not log-
ical,” he explained, “but just the
opposite. What he wants to say is
not logical, nor could it be pre-
sented in a convincing argument
and retain its meaning.” An ex-

Dr. Jenks looks over the notebooks he compiled in Vienna last summer
doing research on the period before World War I.

Dr. Jenks Recalls Parties
When He Was Student Here

By JIM LEDBETTER

“Next year the twenty-fifth re-
union of my Washington and Lee
graduating class will take place. The
school has changed quite a bit since
I was here—our parties were usually
to the tune of recorded music, and
we would practically bribe stags to
come and cut in on us so we could
dance with other girls.”

Much has happened to Washing-
ton and Lee since Dr. William
Jenks, professor of History, grad-
uated in 1939; but much has hap-
pened to him, too. In World War
II he was a cryptographer, assigned
to decode secret messages, and a
political analyst for the O.S.S.; he
has worked for the State Depart-
ment; traveled to Europe to do
research; and is the author of two
books,

When he graduated from W&L,
Dr. Jenks went to Columbia to
work on his Masters, which he re-
ceived in 1940. When the war started
he was sent to Princeton by the
Army to study Arab culture. “Our
base was in Cairo,” he recalls, “and
messages we worked on were so
secret that we couldn’t even talk
about them to each other—under
penalty of court martial.”

After the war he accepted a job
with the State Department doing
essentially the same type of work
he had been doing in the O.S.S. “I
quit after a year,’ he recalls; “it

Lest We Forget

 

      

aah

Here at Washington and Lee we
are proud of our traditions. They
have served us well and it is our
privilege to guard them for the
short time that we are here, not
our right to question them.

We have been informed that an
ancient tradition, one that served
Washington and Lee for many
years, was somehow allowed to
flounder and be forgotten through
neglect.

The tradition goes like this: the
revered likeness of Cyrus Me-
Cormick, gracing the campus
grounds near Lee Chapel, will be
seen to gently stroke his beard
every time a virgin walks by.

This ancient tradition should
be revived, lest we forget. In case
you are worrying about what
Cyrus has been doing all these
years, don’t—he never forgets.

 

was too bureaucratic, and I didn’t
feel that I was earning my money.”

In 1946 Dr. Jenks came here to
teach, and has remained ever since.
During the summers he continued to
work on his Doctorate, which he re-
ceived in 1949. His thesis was pub-
lished as The Austrian Electorial
Reform of 1907. In 1960 he published
another book Vienna and the Young
Hitler. “I hope the next one comes
out sooner than 1970,” he says, but
you never can tell.”

Last summer Dr. Jenks travelled
to Vienna to do research on that
period in Austrian history just be-
fore World War I. “They tried the
democratic approach for several
years before the war,” he says,
“and, as we know, it failed. I am
interested in finding out why.”
The results of his research are
sitting in his office in a tall pile
of notebooks, waiting to be inter-
preted and incorporated in his
forthcoming book.

Since he is a well-known scholar
both in and out of his field, Dr.
Jenks is a member of several com-
mittees, including the national se-
lection committee for Fulbright
Scholarships which sends students
to Vienna to do research, and the
Chairman of a Southern History
Essay Committee, which judges
graduate papers in this field for
cash awards.

Alas For Liberality!

Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Lexington, Va.
Dear Sir:

Recently, I have read that stu-
dents at University of Texas and
Indiana University voted to with-
draw from N.S.A. (National Student
Association). In connection with the
publicity which accompanied these
important withdrawals from this
radical organization, I was very glad
to see that Washington and Lee was
listed among 14 colleges which have
rejected NSA affiliation in recent
years.

I am an avid reader of Ring-tum

Lee in the fall.

“Students study more today than|
they did in my undergraduate days,” |
recalls Dr. Jenks, “but somehow the
number of really bright students has
not changed. Two members of my
graduating class are college presi-
dents now. Perhaps I should say
merely that the level of competence
has gone up.”

Critical Method

In this, the last issue of the
Friday edition this year, Tom
Pace, regular movie columnist, is
making an effort to explain the
fact that different people view
movies in different ways.

By TOM PACE

There are several sad things about
good film critics. Aside from the fact
that they are always wrong, they
must present their judgment to a
mass of movie-goers who are not en-
thusiastically in sympathy with the
critics’ interest, that interest being
good films. Because of this, the
moviegoers own uneducated opinion,
there is an abundance of poor film
critics in America.

For some unknown reason, news-
papers seldom acquire critics with
discerning taste. These critics are the
ones who form, or at least help to
form, the mass opinion of a film.
How else does a movie like the
“Music Man” become so popular and
so praised by the man in the street?
This means opinion is the same that
acclaim “Ben Hur,” “Hatari,” and
“Exodus.” You can all admit that
these are not good films, and you
won't hesitate to throw yourself
above that level which appreciate
them.

So there is another level; that is
the level of the somewhat educated,
the almost sophisticated film goer.
This level boos Stanley Kramer

“On the Beach,” and “Inherit the

Phi but did not note any reference
to W&L’s rejection of affiliation, so
I am belatedly congratulating the
student body on their intelligence in
this matter.

It is noted that there have also
been 32 colleges which have with-
drawn from N.S.A. since 1961.

I hope W&L continues to reject
NSA,, which has passed the follow-
ing liberal or “pink” resolutions at
its national conventions:

1. Defense of Japanese student
rioting against Eisenhower.

2. Praise for Fidel Castro’s Educa-
tional Reforms.

3. Recommendation that the House
Committee on Un-American Activ-
ities be abolished.

4, Opposition to loyalty oaths for
students receiving federal loans.

5. Protests against the firing of
communist teachers.

6. Denunciation of U.S. measures
to achieve nuclear superiority.

I hope W&L continues to resist
any liberal, “pink,” or “red” ac-
tivities, whether by students, pro-
fessors, or outsiders.

Yours truly,

CHARLES G. GILMORE

Dear Mr. Gilmore:

The Friday editors appreciate
your continuing interest in W&L,
and only wish more alumni were
as loyal.

As for the school’s rejection of
NSA, however:

We heard about the student
body’s rejecting it, probably from
the same conservative magazine
you did, listing us among 14 other
colleges whose students unani-
mously rejected NSA.

Since we were quite sure we
had not voted either for or against
NSA affiliation, we checked into
the matter. It seems that for the
last several years, the Executive
Committee has done it for us. We

 

understand that this year one in-
dividual spoke for the entire stu-
dent body in rejecting W&L’s
joining the organization with
“pinko” schools,

The rejection was not made
public (by “public” we mean the
student body itself) because the
EC chose not to do so, just as
they had chosen to speak for
1,000 W&L students in rejecting
the proposal.

While we feel sure the students
would have rejected NSA affilia-
tion, they were never given the
opportunity to decide.

This illustrates quite well, Mr.
Gilmore, just how little you have
to worry about liberal activities
at W&L. You can rest assured
that every effort is being made
and will continue to be made to
keep Washington and Lee just as
it was when you, and perhaps
even your grandfather, were here.

THE EDITORS

A Re-Lament

To the Student Body:

At the risk of kicking a very
dead dog, we should like to com-
ment on Steve Smith’s diatribe
against “name calling” in the Honor
System controversy.

While Smith may have inadvert-
ently hit upon a grain of truth here
and there, the body of his editorial
was irresponsible. What we said the
EC and Lanny Butler did, they did.
It’s quite that simple, and every-
thing we said can be proven.

However, we stand on our word
and choose not to enter into a refu-
tration of Smith’s refutation of our
editorial entitled “A Lament.”

If, though, anyone is interested
in knowing what did happen we
shall be glad to talk with him and
explain why we said the things we
did.

Exchange Student Reflects

 

After A Year In America:

By
Raimondo Strassoldo-Graffembergo

The funny thing about going (I do
not mean as a tourist) in a foreign
country is that it gets so difficult to
generalize about it. It is the same old
problem: the more you know, the
less you know.

When I was in Italy my image
of America was quite sharp and well
defined by a set of handy stereotypes.
Now they all went to pieces.

In my case this is too bad, be-
cause my image of America was
completely positive. This is not un-
common in my country, where for a
long time the two main schools of
political thought used to be the
Philo-Americanism and the Philo-
Bolscevism.

I was was Philo-American to the
point to display a crew-cut in a land
of long hair. I thought Americans
are all wealthy, all eager to love
and be loved, and all disinterested
Knights of Freedom & Democracy.
America was my stainless dream-
land. So I apply, get the Fulbright
Scholarship and am sent to the
Washington and Lee Campus.

~~ Chain Reaction

I started to look for that famous
American friendliness, and find a
wall of disinterest, self satisfaction,
apathy. It is a hard blow. If they
are not interested in me, then why
are they paying for me? This nasty
thought starts a chain of reaction
which destroys all my former “good”
stereotypes. Idealism? They are just
as self-interested as any other na-
tion; their national pride is often
pushed to the point of chauvinism.
Knights of Freedom? Their anti-
communism is often just as blind and
irrational and oppressive as Com-
munism itself. Democracy? Just
pretend to be a Negro wanting to
vote in Greenwood, Alabama. Free
Enterprise? Look at American T&T,
and the steel industries. Wealth?
Yes indeed, but look at the slums,
the unemployees and the hillbillies
swarming in Lexington on Saturday
afternoon.

I agree, this is not quite an im-
partial way to look at America. It
is only a natural reaction to all the
rosy dreams I had been taught to
believe in, when I was in Italy.

Not Necessary

Now I laugh at my naiveness, but
I feel betrayed. Was it necessary for
me to get such a shock, at the con-
tact with the American reality? I
do not think so. I have met lots of
exchange students who came back
with an enthusiastic impression of
America, and American friendliness.
I think all my attitude is due to
the feeling of not being particularly
welcome on this campus.

Of course, this is a generalization;
I have met a great many really nice
and friendly people. But very, very
few of them have been interested
in me as the foreign student from
Italy.

 

|A Student’s Images Crumble

Resigned

I have long since resigned to this
lack of interest. No longer I look
at America with the hatred of the
rejected lover, but as an impartial
observer. So I had opportunity to
dismantle also those few negative
stereotypes I used to have. First
of all, “American students do not
work very hard.” I learned the con-
trary, at my own expenses: here
people do work. Second, “Americans
wear large and baggy clothes and
terrible ties.” That is not true, either.
They wear fancy Madras and white
socks. “Their shoes are big and
heavy and strong.” False. As soon
as I got to this country, I bought
a pair of shoes like that, and not
only did I find myself hopelessly out-
moded, but the shoes are already
falling apart. “Their food is terrible.”
Wrong. I am nuts for hot dogs, and
I never ate so much spaghetti as
here.

The list of the wrecked stereotypes
could go on for many columns. As I
said in the beginning, it is inevitable
that when you live in a country for
one year, all the easy generalizations,
for the good and for the bad, do not
hold any more.

What surprises me is that Ameri-
icans, among other things, think that
the coffee here is the best in the
world: the Italians think the same
about their coffee, and probably so
do the Germans, the French, and
every other nation. I can’t judge,
since I am not a coffee drinker.

Contradictions

Another thing that took me com-
pletely off-guard is that at the
combo parties you are supposed to
look as informal as if you just
jumped out of bed; that slow, soft
dances are almost unknown; that
everybody has to get drunk at least
once a week; that there is such a
nice range of “entertainment for
men” magazines; that all college
girls dress alike; that there are so
many young men men interested in
religion and _ theology; and_ so
on. There are so many different,
contradictory things that could be
said, that no generalization is pos-
sible; and I know but a narrow
geographical strip, and a very thin
social stratum.

Human Beings

I tremble, thinking to all that
future questioning, “Well, how does
America look like?” There is no
way to put my impressions in a
single sentence. All I shall be able
to say is that America is a big
place, inhabited by Americans, each
of whom is just a human being; each
of whom is no better, no worse than
any other human being.

In other words, Americans are not
different than the rest of mankind.
What is different are the traditions,
the habits, and the customs. And,
of course, the amount of money and
power they hold.

Team

Upcoming Underclassmen
Help To Provide Spirit

By CHARLIE SWEET

For the past week under the guid-
ance of Coach Joe Lyles and As-
sistant Coach Bob Lathrop, former
Washington and Lee soccer star and
now law student, the Generals’
soccer team has been practicing.
Coach Joe Lyles expects to culmi-
nate this week of drills with a reg-
ular game today.

a

Game Today

It is expected to be an Alumni
game if last year’s Co-captains Bob
Pagano and Tommy Clements can
come up with enough men. Coach
Lyles feels this game will give him
a good chance to look at next year’s
prospects and a fair indication of
how Washington and Lee’s chances
will be next year. Last year the
General booters finished the season
with a 7-4-2 slate, and copped third
place in the Virginia State Soccer
tournament.

Squad Promising

And the chances for next year—
Coach Lyles feels they are fairly
good for one of the best seasons
ever. Absent only are the two cap-
tains, Pagano and Clements. The |
squad will be bolstered by the re-|
turn of five freshman lettermen

including starting center forward
and all-tournament selection Tim
Henry, Frank Wakefield, Dave Red-
mond, Wes Horner, and Claybourne
Darden. The squad also boasts the

return of four rising juniors, all
lettermen and_ starters, including
inside left Charlie Sweet, outside

left Howie Busse, right fullback Eb
Warner, and left halfback Bruce
Jackson. The two returning rising
seniors are the co-captains for the
1963 campaign Jim Mell and Tom
Greene. Mell plays at either inside
or wing and was the teams leading
scorer last year, while Greene, a
former all - tournament — selection,
protects the goal. Also returning
after a year of ineligibility are rising
juniors Pete Preston and Chris
Clark. So with the return of these
two, and eleven returning lettermen,
and only two rising seniors, the*
chances for next year seem rather
yood. If next year is not the year,
the team certainly boasts a fine
chance for the following year.

Fall practice begins for the Gen-
erals on September 9, with a practice
game against Fort Lee scheduled,
before the booters officially open
their season on September 29 against
Guilford College.

McDaniel Sports Star Of Week;
Called One Of Top Ten In U.S.

The biggest supprises do not al-}
ways come in the biggest packages,
nor are the best athletes necessari-
ly the biggest. |

And, Washington and Lee Univer- |

sity junior John McDaniel certainly | has made John a first rate lacrosse |

fits that description. He stands only |
5-7 and weighs 160 pounds, but he’s |
a top-notch lacrosse and football |
player.

W&L lacrosse coach Bob McHenry
calls McDaniel “one of the 10 best
midfielders in the country,” and
football coach Lee McLaughlin de-
seribes him as “an excellent quarter-
back.”

Lacrosse, however, seems to be
McDaniel’s best sport. From his mid-
field position, he has led the W&L

squad to wins over Duke, North
Carolina and Towson State this
year.

His biggest test comes this Satur-

rival and lacrosse power, the Uni-
versity of Virginia, at Charlottes-
ville. That game will mark the close
of the Generals’ 6-3 season.

McDaniel has scored in all nine
of W&L’s games this year, but his
total production is lower than 1962
because “all of W&L’s opponents are |
ganging up on him.”

For nine games, the hustling mid-
fielder has 11 goals and 10 assists
to his credit.

McDaniel had never played la-
crosse before coming to Washington
and Lee in 1960. He did, however,

come from a lacrosse background—
his father, Dr. Joseph McDaniel, was
an All-American attackman for
Johns Hopkins.

“Hard work and love of the game

player,’ McHenry said. “He’s such a
hard worker that he always comes
to practice anywhere from
minutes early to work on his stick
work.”

What

McDaniel lacks in size, he

makes up in aggressiveness, compe- |

tiveness and ability. He keeps him-
self in such good physical condition
that besides his first midfield berth,
he plays attack when the third mid-
field is in the game.

McDaniel’s biggest assct is his cut-
ting ability.

“He can go with either
quickly and easily. He has very fast
stick control and can guide the
ball into the goal perfectly,” Me-
Henry said.

McDaniel’s control of ground balls
and his dodging ability are two other
important factors which account for
his excellence.

Against Duke McDaniel executed
three different dodges and faked the
goalie to score the second of his

three goals, as he paced W&L to a}

9-3 win.

Hard work, desire and determina-
tion have made John McDaniel a
constant threat in any lacrosse
game—a threat about which W&L’s
opponents really have to worry.

The Washington and Lee tennis
team has just completed a fine 5-3
season. One game, the match with
Colgate was rained out.

In their first match, the Generals
dropped a tough one to the Tigers
of Hampden-Sydney, 5-4. Victory
hinged on the first doubles match
between Captain John Baker and
Jim DeYoung and Hatcher and
Heieleg of Hampden-Sydney. The
Tigers defeated the Generals in a
hard fought match ending in a
score of 10-8,7-5. In the match Baker
won his singles match as did Mell
‘and Short.

; soundly trounced Georgetown Uni-

players, John Baker and Jim De-

his pleasure in the younger mem-
bers of the team after the game
and said that they had given out-
standing performances.

After the Lynchburg game, the
Generals defeated Richmond on the
Generals’ home court.

Against George Washington, the
Generals suffered some bad luck and
bad weather. It was raining through-
out most of the match and it finally
became so intense that the match
had to be called off. Enough of the
match was played to find the team
losing 742-14. The only Washing-
ton and Lee victory came when
Captain John Baker downed Jerry
Reedy, 7-5, 6-4 in a singles match.

some difficulty but managed to be

from-behind victory.

21 Regional Newspapers
Contribute To Wire Fund

Twenty-one Virginia and Wash-/|
ington, D.C., daily newspapers, a/
Virginia radio station and a broad-
casters’ association have made con-
tributions to the Frank Fuller Wire
Fund of the Lee Memorial Journal-
ism Foundation at Washington and
Lee University.

Prof. O. W. Riegel, director of the
foundation and head of the uni-
versity’s department of journalism
and communications, listed the con-
tributors in an announcement today.

The wire fund is providing Wash-
ington and Lee students with the
full teletype news services of the
Associated Press for the current aca-
demic year. Journalism students use
the AP news reports in copy-editing
and page layout classes, while others
use the service in preparing a night-
ly newscast over Lexington radio
station WREL. The teletype re-
ceiver is located in the journalism
library at Washington and Lee.

The Frank Fuller Wire Fund was
established in 1951 by the late Vir-
ginia editor and historian, Douglas
Southall Freeman, to honor the vet-
eran chief of the Richmond AP
Bureau. Shields Johnson, vice pres-
ident and general manager of the
Times-World Corp. in Roanoke, so-
licited the contributions to the fund
this year. He also is a visiting lec-
turer in journalism at Washington
and Lee.

Contributors for the 1963-64 fund
include the Charlottesville Daily
Progress, The Danville Register and
Bee, the Fredericksburg Free Lance-
Star and raido station WFLS, the
Harrisonburg News-Record, the
Lynchburg News and Daily Advance,
the Newport News Daily Press and
Times-Herald, the Norfolk Virgin-
ian-Pilot and the Ledger-Dispatch,
the Petersburg Progress Index, the
Richmond Times-Dispatch and News
Leader, the Roanoke Times and the

Free access to information—the
problem of denial of news—is the
problem which should be of basic
concern to the public, not “news
management,” Congressman John E,.
Moss (D. Calif.) said recently.

Speaking to SIPA delegates in Do-
remus Gymnasium Moss said, “news
management is inherent in the hand-
ling of any item of information.
When a reporter writes a story or
an editor places it, the news has
been managed.

“If we must fight the battle for
full access with the battle cry of
news management, I am certain
we are foredoomed to failure...
(it) is too difficult to define.” he
said.

Moss, who is chairman of the For-
eign Operations and Government

Information Subcommitte, said that
the real battle lies in free access
to government officials and to gov-
ernment information—to the facts
themselves.

During the past eight years Moss

has become known for his fight for
information. He has been responsible
for the opening of many closed chan-
nels of information. During those
years he said “we found that in the
main government tries sincerely to
keep the public informed” but even
so access is still limited.
“Tt is important to know what re-
strictions are imposed on such ac-
cess, and why. And it is important to
resist all efforts to narrow access
to knowledgeable officials.”

Moss went on to question the
use of security stamps by bureau-
cratic offices. Are these stamps
“placed there because of the real
needs of this nation for greater
security or for some other reason?

Are they put there “because the
information, if it became known,
might involve the agency in contro-

versy? After all, controversy is
healthy for a democratic society.
Controversy is not a valid reason for
withholding information,” he said.

The State Department, Moss re-

ported, is about to abolish one of
its special secrecy stamps. As of
Wednesday the “Official Use Only”
stamp will no longer be used.

This stamp is one of two special
restrictive classifications that the
State Department, like other gov-
ernmental agencies, has developed
outside those listed in the President’s
Executive Order 10501. The other is
“Limited Official Use” which the
Congressman termed “an obvious
duplication.”

This move Moss said should “help
end some of the confusion which
surrounds the system for protect-
ing information vital to the national
security. At the same time it will
save many thousands of dollars now
spent to protect documents which
really do not need protection.”
Another excuse often given for
the classifications is the prevention of
leaks, Moss said. If “someone in
government utilizes a friendly re-
porter to manage the news” this can’t
be stopped. But if he leaks properly
classified information “the govern-
ment has authority to take action
against that official... not against the
reporter who printed the leaked
facts.”

Moss went on to point out that
the problem of news management
and free access were not new nor
were they more acute now than in
past years. In fact, “In the past our
free press has paid the price of
freedom by accepting the necessary
restraints in time of crisis.” Dur-
ing wartime they have accepted
voluntary censorship, he said.

At a Subcommittee hearing last
month Moss reported that mem-
bers of the press were asked what
controls would be accepted by
their profession. “There was unan-
imous agreement that all-out war
requires all-out censorship. And
there was complete support for a
clear set of guidelines on infor-
mation control which the press
would accept in time of danger
such as the Cuban crisis. The
problem of the continuing inter-
national tension was_ rejected,
however, as an excuse for restric-

 

Moss Speaks On Freedom Of Press

tion on full access to government
information.”

The press has demanded guide-
lines, Moss said, “we will insist that
the press and the public be taken
into the government confidence and
be allowed to look at and debate
these plans.”

Moss concluded by saying that
when “the executive branch wants
to withhold and restrict information
it will be done. But when the pub-
lic is alerted it is possible to chip
away at government information
restriction.

“Success lies with the people and
the press. Apathy on the part of the
press has been one of our greatest
problems. There needs to be far
more alertness.”

ample is the open chapter on econ-

of of a typical 19th century essay
on the dismal science advocating
abundance, but which turns into

a witty expostulation to give up
material desire.

Dr. Anderson achieved a rare
blend of the scholar and the dilet-
tante in his lecture which could
easily have erred on the side of
dryness. He was most effective in
discovering Thoreau’s humorous side
for the audience. In trying to pen-
etrate to the essential crux of
Thoreau’s thought, however, he
himself finally resorted to a kind of
mystical imagery, which made ex-
cellent listening but left the listner
essentially where he started—with
Walden Pond itself. Which is not a
bad place to left at all.

Wind”). This level can appreciate
what they call good acting—Gregory
Peck, Paul Newman, and Kirk
Douglas. This level can appreciate
mature subjects, as illustrated in
“The Children’s Hour,” “The Mark,”
“Days of Wine and Roses,” and “The
Hustler.”

They also appreciate the unusual,
the different—“Manchurian Candi-
date” is a good example . And they
begin to appreciate the “La Dolce
Vita” and “Black Orpheus” type
films. This level of enjoyment is a
good one, admittedly, but it. still
lacks critical evolution. The people
on this level remain somewhat linked
to the man in the street, for the
question they ask is still, “Did I
like it?” They are easily impressed
by one aspect or part of a film—the
acting, the theme, the ending—and
forget to judge the film for its over-
all value.

The next level is where I place
myself. We look for what is good
and bad in a movie. We watch closely
from beginning to end, evaluating
each scene as it comes before us.

and what is bad. We try to make
our taste conform to our knowledge.
We love “L’Aventura,” “Hiroshima,
Mon Amour,” “Jules and Jim,” and
“Lolita.” We know why we do. But

good and what is bad in the film.
(Which is why I attacked Gregory
Peck in “Mockingbird.” I liked the
film very much, but knew there were
bad things in it. In my frustration,
I became negative.)

There is one more level. This level
is composed of those super-intellec-
tuals who go to two films a year,
and like only one. They are void of
emotion and can be completely crit-
ical. Luckily, I have yet to meet one
of these creatures. I only hope they
don't really exist .
