Faculty, Students To Confer

On Fraternity

Tomorrow night the IFC wil

conference with members of the faculty for the purpose of
discussing possible improvements in Washington and Lee’s

fraternity system.

IFC President Ross Kyger said that the banquet, followed

by regulated discussion groups,
ideas which the IFC could put into¥
practice. The discussions behind
closed doors will be the first of
their kind between students and fac-
ulty at Washington and Lee.

Faculty members who have been
invited include advisers to fraterni-
ties, members of the faculty com-
mittee on fraternities, and others
who have shown particular interest
in issues planned for discussion, ac-
cording to Kyger. They will meet
with the IFC representatives of each
of the 18 houses on campus.

Dinner will be served at 6:30 p.m.
in the R. E. Lee Hotel. Following
the meal small discussion groups
will be formed to examine a number
of topics chosen in advance by the
IFC. Notes will be taken in each
conference, and the opinions expres-
sed will be compiled, reported on,
and evaluated for possible use by
the IFC.

Among topics which are to be dis-
cussed, Kyger said, are fraternity
finances; the fraternity role in aca-
demic life; deferred rush; social
costs and activities; pledging pro-
grams; more power for the IFC
to discipline individual houses; the
assimilation of non-fraternity stu-
dents into fraternities; and the basic
need for fraternities at Washing-
ton and Lee.

The IFC expressed hope that to-
morrow night’s meeting and “brain-
storming” session with faculty mem-
bers will result in workable ideas
to be applied to the fraternities.

In its meeting last night, the IFC
also moved to alleviate the burden
placed at present on the single fra-
ternity which must pay for a Dance
Set cocktail party. Kyger presented
a statement which will be sent to
the Executive Committee asking
that this expense be paid by a whole
class rather than one house, since
the class presidents are to serve as
Dance Set presidents next year.

Kyger also said the IFC has been
attempting to better assimilate
W&L’s foreign students into the
university by a new program which
allows them to choose the fraterni-
ty at which they take meals. In the
past the foreign students moved
periodically from house to house.

 

EC Names Committee

The Executive Committee has
named Buck Ogilvie, Lamar Lamb,
and Jim Rowe as a screening com-
mittee for Dean Gilliam Award can-
didates.

Students and faculty members
should submit letters reeommending
students for the award to a member
of the screening committee, or mail
letters to Jim Rowe, Box 366.

Debate Squad
Cops Honors
At Two Meets

By JOE ROSENBLOOM

In the highly competitive Camellia
Tournament at the University of
South Carolina and in a University
of Richmond meet, the W&L debate
team has earned significant wins,
according to forensics director Wil-
liam W. Chaffin.

Paced by the “dazzling” perform-
anee of junior Ed Norton, a four
man squad which also included Ed
Fitzgerald, Jack Eure, and Rick
Kneipper finished second among |
eight schools in the Camellia Invita- |
tional Tourney of February 15th and |
16th. The Generals won a total of
nine matches while losing five in
the round robin competition.

Norton teamed with Ed Fitzgerald
to argue the affirmative, triumphing
in five of seven matches and copping
second place individual honors in a
field of thirty-two. Coach Chaffin
commented on Norton’s showing as
“superlative, just superlative.”

Presenting the negative side, Jack
Eure and Rick Kneipper compiled
a record of four wins against three
losses. Kneipper was the tourney’s
sixth best speaker.

Mr. Chaffin praised the entire
team and further remarked, “This
was a particularly strong showing,
and the results were most extraor-
dinary considering that we were
without our first stringers, Bill Noell
and Al Eckes.”

At the Richmond Invitational
Tournament on February 22, W&L
was again represented by a four
man unit. On this occasion fresh-
man Ed Fitzgerald and Mike Hay-
slip combined their talents to
emerge with a third place trophy in
the novice division.

The two novice debaters were vic-
torious in four of six matches. They
both received certificates of excel-
lence for their distinguished efforts.

Ace debaters, Noell and Eckes, ac-
companied by Mr. Chaffin, are
scheduled to depart for major
tournaments at the Naval Academy
and at Georgetown University in the
next three weeks.

Law Students Stage
Feigned Court Case
In 1963 Mock Trial

By STEVE CASE

The semi-annual Mock Trial was
held on Wednesday, Feb. 20, under
the auspices of the Washington and
Lee School of Law Student Bar
Association. Law school professor
Robert Huntley presided over the
Trial Court of Tucker Hall, and
Robert Coyle, intermediate Law stu-
dent, served as its bailiff.

Mock Trial is designed to give law
students practice in trial advocacy,
and to familiarize them with pre-
trial procedural steps.

This year’s case, Kilgallen versus
M. B. M. Studios, Inc., was drawn
up by Paul Boswell and Richard
Canterbury, co-chairmen of Mock
Trial. It involves an alleged offer
for a reward to anyone able to prove
that M. B. M.’s leading man, Rock
Talbot, didn’t perform all of his
own dangerous stunts in his new
movie, “Strange Journey.”

The case was based on a similar
one used last year in Harvard's
Mock Trial program, and lay in the
realm of Contract’s law. In order to
recover the $5,000 reward the plain-
tiff had to prove first that there was
a valid offer, second, that he had
accepted the offer, and third, that
he had proved what was required
and was, therefore, entitled to the
reward.

Richard Tavss and Ben Meluskey,
intermediate law students, were the
attorneys for the Plaintiff, and Peter
Bryant, intermediate law students,
Dauk, senior law student, and Brick
were the Defendant's Attorneys. Re-
search assistants to the attorneys in-
cluded Sandy Walton, Stan Atwood,
Thomas Krook, and Michael Bower-

man,
The witnesses in the trial were
ably portrayed by John Dunnel,

Thomas Budd, James Hague, Rich-
ard Bartlett, and Miss Cynthia Le
Rue.

The jury found for the Defendant,
M. B. M. Studios, Inc., denying the
Plaintiff reeovery of the reward, and
disclosed that the Plaintiff had pre-
vailed on the first and second, but
not on the third issue.

LCA Decmues
Campus Room

The University Christian Associa-
tion recently redecorated a room on
the first floor of the Student Union
Building in the hope of stimulating
informal student conversations.

The redecorating was in the hands |
of a committee headed by George
Spaulding and Tom Edwards. At
various times as many as 15 UCA
members aided in the project.

The room was completely repaint-
ed and new furniture, lamps and a
wall-to-wall carpet was added. Mrs.
Ed Atwood aided the UCA workers
in selecting the color scheme and
furniture.

In the future, book shelves will
be added to hold the nine magazine
subscribed to by the Association.
Among those currently subscribed
to are Time, Atlantic Monthly and
Christian Century.

In addition, paper-backs from the
Reflection Book Series will be on
sale in the room. The books cover
a wide variety of topics in the 42
titles available, but mostly deal with
Theology and ethies.

‘Tartuffe’

Carolyn Bing,

Dr. Jones Play Lead Roles
By JOHN KIRKLEY

Tomorrow night at 8:30 the curtain at the Troubadour
Theatre will rise for Tartuffe, a comedy by Moliere and the
second Troub production of the year. The play promises to be
the entertainment highlight of the mid-winter season: it is
colorful, well-played, and uproariously funny.

Reservations should be made in advance at the box office
——* which will be open from two until

six and from seven until eight in
the evenings. The play will run
through Saturday, including a mat-
inee Saturday afternoon at three.

Like many of Moliere’s finest
plays, Tartuffe is a classic satire de-
signed to point out the foibles and
follies of his age. In Tartuffe, which
attacks hypocritical piety and greedy
otherworldliness, Moliere shows that
no vice is beyond the scope of com-
edy.

The setting for the play is the
fashionable home of Monsieur Orgon
(John Dunnell), a good-hearted,
trusting, credulous man. Quickly an
argument develops between Madame
Pernelle, the grandmother (Carolyn
Bing), and the other members of
the household. Mme, Pernelle, stiff,
straight, and strict, scolds them each
in turn; then just as she is about
to leave, Tartuffe, (Dr. Cecil Jones)
is mentioned and she rails anew at
the family for their treatment of
their guest.

As the play develops, one learns
that Orgon has taken Tartuffe, sup-
posedly a penniless but godly man,
into his household. Orgon has treat-
ed Tartuffe to every pleasure he
could offer: food, clothing, shelter,
comfortable quarters; furthermore
it seems that he is reconsidering his
promise to allow his lovely young
Marianne (Betsy Letcher),
to marry his good friend Valere
(George Chapman), and is ponder-
ing instead her marriage to Tartuffe.

It is obvious from the beginning
that Tartuffe has radically influ-
enced the behavior of Orgon. It is
also obvious that the other mem-
bers of the household, which include
Orgon’s wife Elmire (Susy Dunnell),
his son Damis (Charlie Bright), and
the house servant Dorine (Lisa
Tracy), regard as unwelcome their
guest, see him more as a hypocrite
than as a sincerely religious man.

Nor do the actions of Tartuffe, as
characters,
seem to merit the great esteem in
which the master and Mme Pernelle
hold him.

Tartuffe first enters halfway
through the play; he is seen en-
grossed in a book and carrying a
hair shirt and scourge. This entrance
has been carefully prepared for by
Moliere, for the audience has al-
ready had the opportunity to form
an estimation of his character which
is subsequently fully justified.

As the work of Tartuffe becomes
more complete, Orgon disinherits his
son (primarily for telling the truth),
makes arrangements for the imme-
diate marriage of his daughter to
his guest, and signs over to Tartuffe
the deed to his home, thus making
him his heir. Meanwhile Tartuffe

| attempts to seduce Elmire.

Foiled, he finds a means to black-

|}mail Orgon and also takes before
| the court of Louis XIV his legally
| valid

deed to Orgon’s house and

A Word On ReVue

Amid all the cries among students and faculty members
alike for more seminars and more intellectual stimulation, one
man has done something about it.

Mr. Jay Laurence Taylor,

uages, took the initiative some

instructor in Romance Lang-
weeks ago to set up ReVue—

a program of high calibre films, functioning on a subscription
basis. Mr. Taylor, along with his few student assistants, deserve
a great deal of credit for organizing, promoting, and staging

successfully the weekly series.

So far, the presentations have run the gamut of topics
from a French philosophical allegory to a documentary on a
Congolese tribe. The program has already proved itself a sig-
nificant addition to the academic life of the University, and
we sincerely hope that ReVue will become a permanent thing

at W&L.

A Flaunted Tradition

In the past two months a number of students have scorned
the tradition of conventional dress on campus. Many of them
have not been called before the Assimilation Committee be-
cause that committee has been more lax than usual recently.

It has been the cry of our more liberal students that there
should be no Assimilation Committee. They maintain that
the mere existence of such a committee makes Washington
and Lee’s traditions become mere rules. They claim that W&L
gentlemen should behave as gentlemen naturally—not because

they are made to.

Realizing this, the Assimilation Committee informally de-
cided to see what would happen if its function was relaxed. The
result should be obvious to any concerned W&L student. So-
called “gentlemen” are walking around the campus in blue
jeans and tennis shoes, without any sport coat, sometimes

without a tie.
Many students have been

wearing black or red_ shirts.

What makes it worse, it seems that in order to be Joe Studly
one has to let his hair grow for two or three months. Must we
remind students of the spirit of our conventional dress—that
all W&L men appear well-groomed?

The catalogue states that conventional dress consists of a
sport coat and slacks, or suit, with a shirt of subdued color.
Jeans, tennis shoes, and dark-colored shirts are not included
in this. If students themselves won’t take the responsibility of
maintaining a neat appearance, perhaps they could talk to
the Assimilation Committee and the EC about their problems.

Intramurals

Last week’s Tuesday Ring-tum Phi carried a letter to the
editor criticizing the paper for omitting intramural news. This
is indeed a valid criticism, for the intramural program is pos-
sibly one of the most worthwhile endeavors of the student body.

Since Washington and Lee operates on the basis of de-
emphasized intercollegiate athletics, the usual inter-school ti-
valry and school-wide interest is lacking at W&L. It is the role,
therefore, of the intramural program to promote healthy ath-
letic competition and school-wide relations.

In a lot of instances, the only contact members of one so-
cial fraternity have with those of another is on the intramural
field. Here a meeting ground is provided for healthy interaction
between students who share in common the University. Should
interest wane in the intramural program, the primary source
of common activity would be lost to the student body, and ir-
reparable damage would be done to what cohesiveness now

exists at W&L.

We apologize for our omission, and shall strive in the
future to give intramural news its due.

 

‘Taste of Honey’
Communicates
Poignancy, Wit

By TOM PACE

Anything that Walt Disney does
has a certain unmistakable touch
to it.

Whether that touch is heavy or
deft is often debatable. Another time
around will no doubt begin after
“Son of Flubber” has come and
gone. It arrives next Sunday at
the State Theatre, and like its fath-
er, “The Absent-Minded Professor,”
stars Fred MacMurray.

A Taste of Honey

While on touches, Tony Richard-
son deserves mention.

He is the director of “Taste of
Honey” which starts at the Lyric
Sunday. He is not stylistic as are

Antonioni (L’Avventura), Kubrick | |
(Lolita), and Truffaut (The 400]!
Blows).

Instead, he seems to be more

graphic, more real, but unfortunate-
ly, more plodding. To be sure,
“Taste of Honey” is a fine movie. It
concerns a six-month interval in a
young girl’s life. The young girl’s
name is Jo and the six months are
very important ones in her life.

She begins by running away from
school and home (accompanied by
her mother) and runs throughout
the film. While running, she loses
her mother to a man who doesn’t
want Jo, has her first love affair, be-
comes pregnant, lets a homosexual
move in with her, and regains her
mother just when she probably has
no need for her.

Humor and Poignancy

It is a moving story based on a
play by Shelagh Delaney. The mov-
ie retains its humor and poignancy,
and the dialogue is refreshing in its
simplicity. With all forms of art,
however, the interests should lie in
how the story is told.

Richardson is able to make every-
thing seem real. It often appears
that he is taking you with him to
film what is actually happening. His
setting (the places, the people, the
noises) are done with utmost care
to preserve the aura of authenticity.
His camera plays no tricks. It makes
you an observer without and yet
within his simple reality.

Richardson’s actors drive his point
home. None are attractive in ap-
pearance. They look like people you
see everyday. They are real. And
they are good.

Rita Tushingham As Jo

Rita Tushingham’s performance as
Jo is a rarity. She is moving and
warm in the role, affecting emo-
tions and expressions expertly. The
mother (Dora Bryan) received the
British Academy Award, which she
deserved, for her performance.

Perhaps, though, Murray Melvin
does the finest work in his por-
trayal of the homosexual. He is al-
ways in accord with the nature of
the character.

Much credit is due Miss Delaney’s
play. Equal credit is due the actors.
However, the director is solely re-
sponsible for a film’s total result. He
must photograph, cut, edit, fix his
settings, instruct his actors, and
approve everything that goes on the
screen,

Therefore most credit for the
movie’s excellence must go to Rich-
ardson. He is able to achieve plain
authenticity with no pretenses, no
embellishments. Paradoxically, his
strength is also his weakness. He
forgets that art is more than bare
imitation of reality. His lack of pol-
ish and refinement prevent his film
from reaching the greatness which
the films mentioned above did.

Hall and Rockwell

 

Radical Political Leaders Talk At UVa.

By BILL ATWELL

Since the beginning of February,
two incidents have caused a mild
furor in Virginia.

These two were the talks delivered
at the University of Virginia by Sec-
retary of the American Communist
Party Gus Hall and by the self-
styled commander of the American
Nazi Party, George Lincoln Rock-
well.

Hall and Rockwell were invited to
speak by the University’s John Ran-
dolph Society for the purpose of in-
forming students “of the threat
posed by the philosophies which
they represent.”

When the talks were first propos-
ed, reactions were varied. Govern-
or Harrison, the Richmond Times-
Dispatch and the American Legion
were flatly opposed to bringing the
men to U.Va.

Instrument of Our Own Destruction

State Commander of the Ameri-
can Legion Gates Richardson said:
“Our educational authorities must
realize a Communist or a Nazi is
under no compulsion to tell the
truth, and more important, they
must realize that academic freedom

The Peril Of

By JOHN KIRKLEY

One hears much today about Eu-
ropean decadence, exploding popu-
lation, creeping materialism, and the
rise of mass-society. Each of these
generalizations can be supported by
credible evidence and all are con-
temporary phenomena _ resulting
from approximately the same causes,
which tend to support one another.

During the Renaissance the mind
of man became curiously aware of

 

its environment after a period of lat-
ency during the Middle Ages. Mental
and geographical horizons expanded
during the 15th and 16th centuries.
Nations were born; new continents
were founded and settled; scientists
began once again to unfold the won-
ders of nature.

of speech was never intended to be-
come an instrument of our own de-
struction.”

University officials, the Roanoke
Times and the Richmond News-
Leader were more realistic, al-
though hardly enthusiastic, in the
matter.

The News-Leader said, “If the
fire-breathing alumni and the out-
raged Legionnaires will only simmer
down, this unfortunate affair can
be kept from boiling over. It was
poor judgment on the students’ part
to invite this pair, but the making
of judgments is an essential part of
the educative process; inevitably
some wrong judgments must be
made. The University administration
has played its hand with cool re-
straint. Let us leave it now in the
hands of the student body.

“Our guess is that the sophisti-
cated young gentlemen of the Uni-
versity of Virginia will be more
amused than impressed, more curi-
ous than corrupted.”

Let us now turn to the talks them-
selves.

Hall spoke Feb. 28th and Rock-
well Fed. 14th. Both faced capacity

 

audiences at the University’s Cabell
Hall auditorium, more than 500
students being turned away from the
talks.

Trend Toward a Closed Society

Hall spoke mainly against the an-
ti-subversive McCarran Act's regis-
tration law. He said the law came
out of “the hysteria of the McCar-
thy days,” and resulted from “trends
in this land toward a closed society.”

He said, also, that “Capitalism has
reached its peak and has now de-
clined to the point where it and
communism are more or less on an
equal basis.”

The Hall talk was rather unevent-
ful and in the words of one U.Va.
student, “uninteresting and even
dull.”

Rockwell was something of a sur-
prise in his conduct. He spoke in a
conservative blue suit instead of a
storm trooper’s uniform, and man-
aged to avoid much yelling. A stu-
dent commented, “He looks like my
father.”

The U.S. Nazi's opening words set
the tone of his whole speech:

(Continued on page 4)

strange products and vast stores of
wealth were revealed. The religious
teachings of Calvin, Luther, and
others during the Reformation con-
tributed to the formation of a Pro-
testant ethic, as Weber calls it,
which aided and supported the rise
of the industrial - entrepreneural
economy of the Western world.

The development of the profit mo-
tive and of competition encouraged
the growth and expansion of new
means of production and distribu-
tion—automation, factories, mass-
production, automobiles, trucks,
trains, steamships. And from the
sweat, filth, and tears of the indus-
trial revolution urbanism as a way
of life began to grow: people started
to move from the country to the city
to supply labor for production; and
national economies became primar-

 

ily industrial rather than agricultur-
al.
‘Age of Plentitude’

All of these trends came to a head
and produced a crisis in 19th Cen-
tury Europe. According to Ortega
y Gasset, Spanish philosopher,
teacher, and statesman, the 19th cen-
tury was an age of “plentitude,” an
age of superabundance which re-
garded itself as the high-point, the
culmination of historical develop-
ment. Men of the 19th century
thought that, in the future, the world
would remain essentially as it was
but “progress” would continue in-
definitely.

But three trends began during the
19th century which have changed
the face of the world and altered
completely the condition of man-

Britain and the European Common Market: DeGaulle’s Position

By BILL NOELL
and ED NORTON

When, on January 29, 1963, Brit-
ain’s bid to enter the Common Mar-
ket collapsed as a result of steady
and dogged Freneh opposition, the
European Economie Community re-
ceived a major set-back—one of the
first since its formal inception in
1957. As the Wall Street Journel, of
January 30, 1963, suggested, “The
Kennedy Administration was with-
out a good fall-back position, and
now finds itself lacking any clearly
charted course to cope with Brit-
ain’s exclusion....” Indeed, the ad-
ministration on all levels has re-
mained significantly silent on the
entire action, in view of the fact
that the predicted success of Presi-
dent Kennedy’s New Trade Expan-
sion Act was largely contingent on
Britain’s entrance into the E.E.C.
For there to be the substantial tariff
reduction, which the act makes pos-
sible, the United States and the
country or bloc of countries with
which it is negotiating must account

 

for production of more than 80 per
cent of the total free world output
in the particular good or goods in
question. A Common Market with-
out Great Britain will therefore be
unable to receive as proportionally
great reductions as the act had first
envisioned.
Action Favorable to U.S.?

Nonetheless, some trade experts
have asserted that de Gaulle’s ac-
tion may prove beneficial to the
United States. The basic assumption
underlying such an optimistic theory
is that an economically divided Eu-
rope will tend to shy away from
protectionism. Britain, now unable
to sell satisfactorily in the Common
Market may negotiate more vigor-
ously for reciprocal trade agree-
ments with this country. The ar-
gument continues that the six mem-
bers of the existing Economic Com-
munity, denied access to British
markets, may themselves look to the
United States for trade concessions
granted on a reciprocal basis. Such
a position in our view is not credi-

 

ble, as the EEC’s France has no de-
sire to increase its dependence on
the United States, and the degree of
satisfaction, which the members of
such a trisected trading group would
feel in contrast to the visions in-
voked by the Rome Treaty, would
be pale at best. Moreover, such an
outlook is further untenable in con-
sideration of the other and some-
what bleaker alternatives open to
all the parties.
Alternative: Protectionism

The
the Common Market is one of almost
The Wall
Street Journal has speculated as fol-
lows: “France has already made it
clear that it wants Common Market
agriculture walled off from outside
competition; does it really feel dif-
ferent about industry? One can
readily imagine deGaulle’s permit-
ting prolonged trade negotiations
with the United States, just as he
permitted prolonged entry talks with
Britain—but if they show signs of

first alternative available to

complete protectionism.

yielding fruit, will he not be equally
brutal at chopping them off at the
roots?” Though Britain will un-
doubtedly have a sincere nationalis-
tic interest in any movement toward
freer trade, what influence it can
bring to bear on other nations, it-
self being a Common Market reject,
is certainly in doubt. Though sever-
al of the Common Market countries,
because of military associations with
the United States would most prob-
ably not greet with unbounded en-
thusiasm a_ protectionist policy,
which seemed to discriminate against
this country, the obligations created
by the Rome Treaty regarding the
formation of a common external
tariff must surely be expected to
prevail, and to preclude the possi-
bility toward any single nation no
matter how compelling a military
reason might dictate otherwise.

To Create a United Europe

Yet a second and more disturbing
alternative is the one which lies in
the hands of France, herself. It is

 

apparent that de Gaulle’s ultimate

 

objective is to create a united Eur-
ope, at the head of which would be
France—a union which could be sig-
nificantly less dependent on the
United States, and less subject to her
influences. To that end, he is desir-
ous of equipping France with a
deterrent nuclear capability of her
own, despite the tremendous econ-
omic sacrifices that such an effort
will entail. That policy stands dia-
metrically opposed to what the press
has termed “President Kennedy’s
Grand Design”—a multilateral nu-
clear force in which the United
States would retain the elements of
leadership. Some Western diplomats
have even expressed serious concern
that de Gaulle may attempt to ne-
gotiate an independent settlement
with Moscow, hoping to act as a buf-
fer between East and West.

One Man’s Stubbornness
Thus, Europe’s move toward uni-
ty, which began somewhat informal-
ly following the Second World War,
progressing at a rate which has sur-
prised even its most optimistic sup-

 

porters, has been temporarily block-
ed by the stubbornness of one man.
While this unity found its basis
in the economics which were to be
derived from an increasingly large

market area, its ultimate goals
are political, and its architects
envision that the member nations
will greatly be drawn into some
form of supernational European
government. As Walter Hallstein,

the chairman of the E.E.C.’s Coun-
cil of Ministers succinctly put it,
“We are not in business, we are in
politics.” de Gaulle himself fav-
ors a united Europe, but on terms
which should prove unacceptable
to the other members—France must
be the prominent partner. Unlike the
postwar generation of statesmen who
tend to think of themselves not as
Italians, Germans, or Frenchmen, but
as Europeans, de Gaulle remains in
his own mind, France’s appointed
one, introspective and intensely na-
tionalistic. To him, “France is not
herself unless in the front rank. ...
France cannot France

Added Depth, Experience
Makes Grid Picture Bright

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Sports Editor

How does a football coach im-
prove an 8-1 record achieved dur-
ing a “rebuilding year?”

If anyone can answer that ques-
tion, it is Washington and Lee Uni-
versity’s head football coach, Lee
McLaughlin. But even the smiling
W&L boss is not quite sure how to
go bettering his 1962 8-1 mark.

1963 OUTLOOK—"We'll be improved.”
ON GUARDS—"A coach’s dream.”

ON WEATHER—"“‘Sweet are uses of adversity.”
ON OPPONENTS—“They’ll be improved.”
ON ATTITUDE—‘We're just tickled pink.”

  

“We'll definitely be improved this
year,’ MeLaughlin said as he watch-

ed his boys in Spring drills. “But

we're playing a much _ tougher

schedule with the addition of Sus-|

quehanna, Oberlin and Washington
University of St. Louis. The rest of
our opponents also are improved.”
If Spring practice is any indica-
tion, MeLaughlin is right about one
thing—his boys will be improved.

3 New Clubs
To Grid Slate

Washington and Lee University’s
Generals will meet nine opponents
in football this fall including the
four other members of the year-old
College Athletic Conference.

The W&L schedule was announc-
ed Saturday by Athletic Director E.
P. “Cy” Twombly. Four home con-
tests and two new opponents are in-
cluded in the 1963 listing.

New Foes

Newcomers to the Washington and
Lee schedule are Oberlin College
of Oberlin, Ohio, and Susquehanna
College of Selingsgrove, Pa. Return-
ing to the schedule after a one-year
absence is Washington University of
St. Louis, the newest member of the
College Athletic Conference.

Oberlin, Susquehanna and Wash-
ington replace Emory and Henry,
Lebanon Valley and Johns Hopkins
from the 1962 schedule.

The first conference game for
W&L will be against Centre College
and it will be a home contest for the
Generals. The last three games on
the new W&L schedule will be with
the remaining CAC members.

The 1963 W&L schedule:

Sept. 28, Randolph-Macon, home;
Oct. 5, Obelin, home; Oct. 12, Cen-
tre, home; Oct. 19, Susquehanna,
away; Oct. ..26, Hampden-Sydney,
away; Nov. 2 Franklin and Mar-
shall, away; Nov. 9, Sewanee, away;
Nov. 16, Southwestern, home; and
Nov. 23, Washington U., away.

Generals have gotten in seven days
of work on fundamentals and pat-
terns. After a four-day holiday, they
will continue work this week and
wind up with the annual alumni-
varsity game on Saturday, Mar. 2.
More Depth

More depth—McLaughlin welcom-

ed 63 to Spring drills—and a vastly-
improved third team will make the
Generals considerably tougher this
Fall.
W&L has good depth at every spot
except tackle and end. McLaughlin
figures his hardest job will be “try-
ing to select a starting eleven.”

The backfield is particularly over-
flowing with talent.

Leading 1962 ground _ gainers
Stuart Yoffe (482 yards), Skip Chase
(269 yards) and Henry Sackett (167
yards) plus three other veterans are

some

returning at the halfback spots.
Joining them are three promising
rising sophomores—Billy Andrews,

a former Roanoke Catholic Star—
Harry Brookby and Dick Prezzano.

Missing from the backfield this
Fall will be fullback Tommy Keesee,
who tied for Virginia scoring honors
and won berths on the Virginia All-
Small College and All College Ath-
letic Conference teams. Three cap-
able replacements are ready to step
into Keesee’s shoes, though. Rising
senior Syd Butler, rising junior Dan
Manson and rising sophomore John

é gel,
| Davenport

Anthony are scrapping for the start-
ing nod.

Quarterback Solid

The quarterback spot will be well
manned by John McDaniel, A. J.
Barranco, Brice Gamber, Doug Da-
vis, Gordon Gay and Larry Craig.

In the line, there is an abundance
of guards, so many that they’re
causing a “problem” for McLaugh-
lin.

McLaughlin has three returning
varsity stars for guards in Bill An-
George Gossman and Steve
plus two outstanding
freshmen (Jay Bowersox and Joe
Miller) and eight other promising
varsity and freshman players.

Frosh Prospects

Center, W&L’'s chief worry last
Spring, is well fortified with re-
turning starter Mike Sheffey and
a pair of freshmen—Jim Crothers
and Jeff Novinger—both of whom
McLaughlin feels have “an amaz-
ing amount of ability both offensive-
ly and defensively.”

Tackle boasts numbers, but is
short on experience. After Jim Syl-
vester, Bob Henley and Bill Skinner,
the Generals lack men who have
been tested under fire.

End Strong

The Generals’ end situation would
please most any coach, at least at
first glance. Returning are a_ pair
of all-conference selections—Buck
Ogilvie and John Madison—and a
third man, Mike Jenkins, who also
deserves a lot of credit. All will be
seniors.

“Jenkins is the hardest working
boy in Spring drills,’ McLaughlin
noted. “I’m going to have a real
tough time picking two starters from
those three.”

Behind those three, the Generals
don’t have many experienced men.

McLaughlin’s overall outlook is a
bright one. His teams have chalked
up a 25-1-1 record over the last
three seasons, and this Fall he’s con-
fident his boys will be improved.”

Washington and Lee and the Uni-
versity of Virginia proved that they
had Virginia’s top two wrestling
teams in a close-fought battle Mon-
day night in Doremus Gymnasium.
The Cavaliers, trailing 8-2 after
the first three matches, proceeded to
eke out a pair of one-point decis-
ions, a three-point win, and a four-
point triumph to salt away the
match.

Both teams wound up their dual
meet competition with 8-2 record.
For W&L it was the General’s best
season since 1949. The Generals got
their eighth win Friday with a 16-14
decision over West Virginia at Mor-
gantown.

“T’'m proud of every boy on our
team.” said W&L coach Dick Miller.
“They all wrestled well Monday
night and we've had a great year.”

Pete Winfield, the General’s 157-
pounder saw his undefeated string
vanish in the night’s most evenly
fought match. Virginia’s Alex Wells
scored a two-point takedown in the
first period and Winfield managed a
one-point escape in the second peri-
od. That‘s how the match ended.

Dick Albert and Jud Babcock gave

finished second in the 100-yard free-
style in 49.9, the best time of the
year for a W&L swimmer.

W&L also captured the 400-yard
freestyle relay in 3:28.7.

he is striding into the market place,

here is the danger: the mass-man

The mass-man enjoys the abun-

appeal made by Elmire and Orgon’s
excellent friend Cleante (Andy
Leonard). Orgon admits his error
and bemoans his credulity, but is
trapped by circumstances and _ his
own family.

Cleante urges Orgon to flee until
the matter is settled, and Valere has
prepared a carriage for the escape;
the doors are thrown open to allow
a hasty exit, and there stands—
Tartuffe! With him is an armed
guard from the palace, come to se-
cure the arrest of Orgon and in-
sure the removal of his family and
belongings from the very house he
has given to the imposter.

Is there no justice in the world?
Will not imposters, liars, rascals,
cheats be punished and the good
receive their reward, even if they
have been duped and have acted
foolishly? The curtain rises tomor-
row night. For those among you who
have worries, tensions, and hidden
frustrations, the play will be a re-
lief and a pleasure, a relief and a
pleasure.

NOTICE

ensemble, will give a concert here

Political Extremists Fail

To Incite Staid Cavaliers
(Continued from page 2)

“I am not here to agitate. Instead,
I am here to express to you what
I believe in. I am not here to con-
vert you—the best I can do is to
give you hints of some things I
am really not allowed to speak
about.”

Rockwell proved himself fairly ar-
ticulate as a speaker. Some of his
more noteworthy remarks follow:

“I do not believe in any form of
tyranny. We are not atheists, al-
though we may be agnostics. The
American Nazi Party stands for
race. We are scientific racists. The
human race differs in quality just

as all breeds of animals differ in
quality.”
Goldwater ‘Dangerous’
On conservatism: “Goldwater is
the most dangerous man in _ the

country. It’s like appointing a fire-
bug for firechief.”

On Liberalism: “I would like to
take a party of some of you lib-
eral race-mixers up through north-
east Washington around 1 a.m. Then
I would like to see how many of you
come out liberal.”

SIZE CIGARETTE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS? If you missed that one, go to
