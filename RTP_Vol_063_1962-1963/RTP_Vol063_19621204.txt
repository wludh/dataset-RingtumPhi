Eckes Takes
Laurels In
Tournament

By MALCOLM MORRIS

Washington and Lee junior Al
Exckes established himself as one
of the country’s best debaters by
finishing among speakers in the
Pittsburgh Invitational Cross-Exam-
ination Tournament this weekend.

Eckes and Ed Norton were unde-
feated in the meet.

In competition with some of Amer-
ica’s top teams as well as repre-
sentatives of Canada and the West
Indies, Eckes amassed a spectacular
total of 112 points out of a possible

125. This gave him first place in
the five rounds of debate over 147
other speakers.

Forty schools were entered in the
international tournament, including
national champion Ohio State, deep
South power Alabama, midwestern
power Southern Illinois, three fore-
ign teams, and many other big names
in debate.

Only Undefeated Affiirmative

Eckes and Norton were the only
affirmative team to compile a per-
fect 5-0 record, yet they finished
second in total affirmative speaking
points. The W&L team defeated St.
Vincent, Colgate, Miami, West Vir-
ginia Wesleyan, and Alabama, giv-
ing the Alabama negative team its
only loss.

With only two men debating in-
stead of the usual four, W&L was
not eligible for the overall tourna-
ment crown, which was won by
Alabama with an 8-2 record.

W. W. Chaffin, coach of the de-
bate team, was elated over the
weekend’s results, stating that this
is the first time in three years a
W&L team has earned a perfect rec-
ord in an out-of-state tournament.
He pointed out also that Eckes has
been a member of an undefeated
side on W&L teams four times in the
last three years.

Chaffin was also quick to praise
Norton, who began debating only
last semester. “Norton,” said the
coach, “finished surprisingly well,
and must now be ranked with Eckes
and Bill Noell.”

The Pittsburgh tournament was
the first cross-examination debate
for W&L this year. The national
topic for this year, the establishment
of a free world economy community,
was debated. In cross-examination
debate each speaker is allowed to
talk eight minutes and then is cross-
examined for four minutes. Each
side is also allowed a four-minute
summary.

So far this year W&L debate teams
have had winning records in all five
tournaments entered. Both Noell
and Eckes have won_ speaking
awards, and W&L has finished con-
sistently high in all competition.

Chaffin is taking Noell and Eckes
to the Dixie Classic at Wake Foresi
next weekend. —

 

Whipping Post
Is Stall Utilized
In Dover, Del.

By STEVE SMITH
To be administered “publicly by

strokes on the bare back, well laid
on.”
A 20-year-old man of Dover

Delaware, will receive 20 lashes at
the whipping post as the nation’s
only such law is enforced “at the
convenience of the State Board of
Corrections.” His crime is petty
lareeny and violation of probation.

Franklin W. Cannon, Jr., will be
the first person since 1952 to receive
a flogging as punishment. Whipping
posts still stand in every Delaware
county, and may be used for laying
on from 5 to 60 lashes, for the crimes
of “robbery, assault, embezzlement,
poisoning with intent to murder,
arson, burglary, larceny, horse-
stealing, wife-beating,” and in short,
nearly everything but over-parking.

Cannon was charged with petty
larceny on two accasions following
his being placed on probation for
stealing a car in 1961. For the origi-
nal crime the then teenager was
given a suspended sentence of 20
lashes and three years imprisonment.

Punishment May Be Private

Public opinion in Delaware has},

been aroused by Cannon’s case, and

perhaps for that reason the flogging |,

may be administered in an enclosure
prepared for the purpose, rather
than in the open. The regular whip-
ping post in Kent County, in which
Dover is located, stands in front of
the jail, and in full view of the
street.

Although this punishment has
been considered so barbarous (and
ineffective) that all other states
which once used it have dropped it,
Delaware appears to be far from
abolishing whipping. In 1959 a law
passed the Delaware legislature
which would have made whipping
mandatory for “felons eonvicted of
robbery,” but the act was vetoed by
the governor. In 1961 a bill to make
whipping mandatory for armed rob-
bery and rape failed to pass.

|ED ‘Playmate’

Will Be Chosen

By JIM DEYOUNG

An added highlight to this year’s
Fancy Dress cocktail party will be
the selection of five playmates from
the girls attending the party. The
great white playboy in the sky, the
heralded editor of Playboy Maga-
zine will serve as judge.

Each escort will submit a photo-
graph of his date, and since the can-
didates are to be selected by Play-
boy from these photographs, judg-
ment will be based on beauty, ex-
pression, and figure. Personality and
vivaciousness won’t be considered,
and of course, the pose and photo-
graphic quality will influence the
final decision.

The winners will be announced by
a telephone call direct to the band-
stand from Playboy during the play-
boy cocktail party in honor of
Fancy Dress President Ham Emory.
The winning playmates will be
lauded and awarded gifts at the
party.

Entries must be submitted to
Ralph Wiegandt, Playmate Contest,
Box 234, Lexington. Each photo-
graph must accompany an_ entry
blank( to be found on the fourth
page of this issue), and all entries
must be in by January 16th, so
Playboy will have enough time to
savor the charms of the candidates.

Contest chairman Wiegandt urges
everybody: don’t hide your bunny
under a bushel, enter her in the
playmate contest.”

An entry blank for the contest may
be found on page four.

——# Count Basie has appeared with his

Orchestra in Carnegie Hall, The

Newport Jazz Festival, the New

York Jazz Festival, and in concert

halls all over continental Europe.
Early Years

Basie’s first musical fame came
when he played with the Benny
Moten Orchestra as star pianist. On
Moten’s death in 1935, Basie formed
a group of his own from the nucleus
of Moten’s group. and he named it
“Count Basie’s Orquestra.” Since
that time he has been an orchestra
leader almost continuously, the ex-
ception being in 1950-51 when he
lead sextet in appearances in small
cafes around the nation.

Basie was “discovered” by Benny
Goodman in 1937 in Kansas City and
came under contract to Goodman’s
personal manager. He went first to
Chicago and then to New York,
where he made his first records for
Decca in 1939. That same year he
made an appearance in New York’s
famous Carnegie Hall and _ started
the trend of jazz concerts.

One of his first recordings, “One
O’clock Jump,” swept Basie into the
musical spotlight, and since he has
had numerous recording and now
has over eighteen albums on various
labels.

Basie in Hollywood

In 1942 Basie debuted in Holly-
wood in the picture, Reveille with
Beverly, in which Frank Sinatra also
debuted and launched his movie
career. Through the Forties he con-
tinued his movie-making, nation-
wide, record-breaking tours, and he
began frequent guests sports on ra-
dio, His engagements were continu-
ous through 1949.

The Fifties

After a couple of years with a
small jazz combination, Basie was
back with his big band in 1951. He
quickly moved upward and was
named “top jazz band” in 1954 by
the Down Beat Critics’ Poll and in
the following year by Down Beat
Reader's Poll.

In 1954 he made his first tour of
Europe. He holds his second Euro-
pean tour in 1956 as “the greatest
thrill ever.” He appeared from Spain
to Scandinavia and his performances
were a sellout in many cities; Co-
penhagen, Paris and Berlin perhaps
being the biggest and most exciting
spots on his tour. In Berlin he
played at the Sport Palast on the
platform from which Hitler had
made many of his most infamous
speeches, speaking a new, inter-
national language, “Basie English.”

While in England on tour in 1958
he was invited to appear and be
the first American orchestra to play
at the Royal Command Performance
Show for Queen Elizabeth at the
world-famous Pallaf Palladium
Theater in London.

begun, Basie has already been fea-

Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

In Pursuit of Controversy

The student body of Washington and Lee in general and
the Ring-tum Phi in particular have been accused rather fre-
quently in recent weeks of being controlled by vested interests,
being opposed to controversy or change in any form, and be-
ing fantically in favor of maintaining the status quo. We of-
fer contents of this week’s edtorial page as a refutation of
such charges, especially the one of “vested interests” leveled
at the Ring-tum Phi.

We have, in order, an article in support of integration by
Bill Lowry, a proposal by John Kirkley for drastic revision of
the cut system, a humorous comment on the social quirks of
Democrats and Republicans, and a provocative analysis by
John F. Refo of the Glasgow lectures and speakers.

While we do not necessarily concur with the ideas expressed
in any or all of the articles on this page, we do hold heartily
to the concept that the college newspaper’s purpose is to act
as a media not only of campus news but also as an agent of
expression for student thought. We intend to continue in a
policy of printing articles which will stimulate criticism and
comment and which will perhaps help somewhat the cause of
intelletual awareness at Washington and Lee.

We shall not endorse change for change’s sake, but we
shall upon occasion offer our support to innovations we feel
are warranted. A case in point is the cut system controversy.
Because we do feel that student body opinion is strong enough
to merit it, the Tuesday edition is conducting an intensive
study of absence regulations both at W. and L. in the past and
at other comparable institutions at the present. In the near
future, we will print the results of our survey.

We resent the label of “reactionary,” and we wholeheart-
edly deny the charge of “vested interests."? Our concern is
with producing a college newspaper of high calibre in form
and content, and in promoting the continued improvement of
the Washington and Lee community.

‘Begin At Washington And Lee’
Integration: Are We

 

 

By BILL LOWRY

Much discussion has taken place
in recent weeks about such subjects
as the honor system, academic im-
provement and curriculum revision,
the cut system, ete—all of which
are, of course, legitimate areas of
concern and which deal with the re-
sponsibility of the University to the
student community. However, the
student community is not our only
community; and a great university
will recognize that it has a respon-
sibility to these other communities
as well. Washington and Lee exists,
therefore, not only to serve its stu-
dents, but to serve the nation in
general, and the South in particular.

The Transitional South

The South today is in a great peri-
od of change. The question we must
ask ourselves is: how is Washington
and Lee to act responsibly in this
troubled situation? Should we seize
the initiative and help to usher in
a new era, or are we to remain pas-
sive through crises, changing only
when there is no other choice? The
latter attitude is clearly not a re-
sponsible one. The South looks up
to Washington and Lee for leader-

 

ship; it is up to us to provide that
leadership. So far, we have failed to
do this—we have instead appealed to
outmoded traditions and _ values,
most of which are meaningless.

The Issue of Integration

The most important issue facing
the South today is, of course, that
of racial integration. With this in
mind, let us examine our attitude
toward the subject, keeping in mind
the question of our responsibility to
the South. This means, in the first
place, that we must openly discuss
the subject, instead of ignoring the
issue as if it did not exist. Perhaps
the most tragic implication of last
year’s infamous decision forbidding
Dr. Martin Luther King to speak
here—aside from the important
question of academic freedom—is
that it reflects an unfortunate atti-
tude to pretend that an issue does
not exist and that we can remain
free from responsibility by remain-
ing in ignorance. Such an ostrich-
like stand certainly represents an
abdication of responsibility and a
failure to provide leadership where
it is needed.

Second,

Washington and Lee

 

Status Quo ‘Insult and Intellectual Affront’

 

The Cut System: A New Suggestion

(Editor’s note: John Kirkley, a
W&L junior and contributor to the
Ring-tum Phi, has initiated a move
to revise the University’s present cut
system. His ideas on the topic, pre-
faced by a general comment on the
need for a change in the cut system,
follow.)

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Washington and Lee is a small,
semi-authoritarian institution in a
sea of democracy. But, since it exists
in a democratic environment, the
regulators of its policies should rec-
ognize the right of its principle body
—the students, for whom W&L real-
ly exists—to express itself where its
interests are concerned,

The purpose of an American uni-
versity is to train future citizens to
accept positions of leadership in this
powerful nation. Leadership is based
on individual responsibility and
courage. These qualities are devel-
oped when an_ individual, faced
with a choice, can follow a_ set
course of action with the willing-
ness to accept the consequences of
his action.

i feel that a more liberal cut sys-
tem would provide students a means
to develop individual responsibility
and maturity through the exercise
of greater freedom of choice than
they now have.

A petition urging the faculty to
adopt a more liberal system of ab-
sence regulations along the lines

 

suggested below would, I think, in-
dicate two things: (1) that a signifi-
cant majority of the students are de-
sirous of change and (2) that they
are willing to accept the necessary
increase in individual responsibility
that would accrue to them.

There are two points in my article
which might cause outraged howls
on the part of a few: small minds see
rain on their picnic, great ones the
swelling grain and rich harvest.

The Washington and Lee cut sys-
tem should be altered radically. As
it stands, it is an intellectual affront
to our students and an insult to their
character.

There seem to be three chief ar-
guments used to support the cut
system. The first is that Washington
and Lee students, aged seventeen or
above, are not mature enough to
weather a change.

Parental Guidance

What this says to the student is
this: “You are not yet old enough
to know what is best for you. You
don’t have enough common sense to
attend to your own business or
enough classes to receive the grades
you wish. You still need firm, par-
ental guidance to order and pattern
your life toward a constructive goal.”

I would answer that the students
which W&L wants have enough of
an idea of what they want to ap-
proach their education as they think

 

best. Often a student would receive

more benefit from a discussion, in-
dependent study, or even an extra
hour of sleep than he would from
attending classes.

Would Disaster Result?

The second defense for the system
is the assertion that disaster would
result if students were given great-
er freedom. Such statements are
based on past experiences at W&L
when a new cut system was insti-
tuted according to an_ incredibly
short-sighted plan with unfortunate
consequences. I would say that those
students who flunk out when given
greater freedom should not be at
W&L anyway.

The final statement of the pro-cut
system person is the “We want to
help you” attitude on the part of the
faculty. I say that responsibility
builds maturity, confidence, further
responsibility. I say, “Let us be our-
selves and we will become more
than you could ever make of us or
hope for us.”

One placard read, “Students of
W&L unite! We have only our intel-
lectual chains to lose!”

Disadvantages Cited

The disadvantages of the W&L
cut system are several: Often a stu-
dent needs to cut a class in order
to do a special assignment, study
for an hour quiz, or write a paper:
this he cannot do; often the time
spent in class could be better spent
elsewhere: the classroom contact

with certain teachers is debilitat-
ing to the intellect; occasionally ev-
ery thinking man needs time to as-
similate and digest ideas rather than
be subjected to more of them:
teachers can become another bar-
rage of words.

A recent case history gives the lie
to the validity of the present cut
system. A prominent and valuable
member of the student body was
“kicked out” for overcutting a class.

Hollins Has More Cuts

Vassar, Hollins, and Randolph
Mason girls have more freedom and,
by implication, more maturity and a
greater sense of responsibility than
W&L gentlemen. At Oxford, one of
the world’s greatest educational in-
stitutions, no class requirements are
found.

What should the new system be?
For all freshmen and for all upper-
classmen with an average below
1.00, one week of cuts. For all up-
pererclassmen with an average of
1.00 or better, unlimited cuts, except
before and after holidays. For all
upperclassmen with an average of

Poor Student Attendance Failed To Lessen
Success Of Glasgow Seminars In Literature

By JOHN FRANCIS REFO

Previous editorial comment ap-
peared to take the position that the
University had fasted nearly $5000
and the talents of Richard Eberhart,
Northrop Frye Robert Lowell and
Howard Nemerov on the recent lit-
erary festival because of poor stu-
dent attendance. I disagree with this
negative statement, but first, what
happened at the Festival?

Eberhart’s Audience

Mr. Eberhart, unfortunately, “got
it in the neck,” managing to draw
only 66 students in three appear-
ances. And this, I admit, was em-
barrassing. However, Mr. Eberhart
produced the finest lecturer-audi-
ence debate which I have heard at
Washington and Lee. After compli-
menting Messrs. Boatwright and
Jennings for their splendid reading
of his verse study, “The Preamble
II,” he was faced with several, direct
student questions asking him to de-
fine the proper relationship between
verse drama as good theatre and as
good poetry. Mr. Eberhart defend-
ed the latter, but with difficulty.

The poet’s reading November 27
was one of his best performances. It
included many superb poems, among
them “A Meditation on Style,” and
“The Horsechestnut.” Only in his
trying lecture, “Emerson and Wal-
lace Stevens,” did Mr. Eberhart fall
below the standards which he had
set Monday night and Tuesday af-
ternoon.

Capacity Crowd for Frye
Northrop Frye, lecturing on “The

   

 

Structure of Imagery in Modern|
Poetry,” filled even the aisles of
duPont auditorium. Thursday night.
Discussing the work of T. S. Eliot, of
William Butler Yeats, and Wallace
Stevens, Dr. Frye proved that poets
have relied on similar imagic struc-
tures to relate the personal world to
the natural impersonal one. The
critic also had a sense of humor.

Shirking Our Duty?

should discuss the issue with spe-
cific reference to our own situation.
We can best show leadership here
by setting an example. If integrating
the entire school at once should
prove to be too much, we could be-
gin by integrating, say, the school
of law. This does not mean, of
course, accepting anyone merely for
the sake of integration; there is no
need to “lower our standards.” We
should simply make clear, perhaps
in an explicit statement in the cata-
logue, that “Washington and Lee
will not refuse admission to quali-
fied students on racial or religious
grounds.” This should be done
soon as possible.

as

A Moral Question

Washington and Lee is, of course,
a private institution and is under no
legal obligation to integrate—the
question is one of moral, not legal
responsibility. Such a stand as the
one outlined above would, of course,
require much courage. Yet, such
courage would be in the best of our
traditions, including the example of
our own Robert E. Lee.

The be

issue should

than on the basis of so-called “prac-
tical consequences.” Yet, certain
consequences may certainly follow
if we continue in our obstinate fail-
ure to act. Other schools in thet
South have already integrated—the
example of Davidson, a school not
unlike Washington and Lee, should
be kept in mind.

Also, Washington and Lee was
not included in the many Ford
Foundation grants given out last
spring—could our intolerant attitude
toward racial and other questions
have had anything to do with this?
Tradition, merely for the sake of
tradition, is worthless. Furthermore,
our “tradition” of racial exclusion is
in conflict with those higher ideals
for which Washington and Lee
stands.

Certainly we have much more to
gain than to lose.

“What shall it profit it a man, if he
shall gain the whole world, and lose
his own soul?” This’ statemetnt
could well apply to Washington and
Lee. As one of the South’s fore-
most institutions of higher learning,
isn’t it W&L’s responsibility to take
the lead in this matter as it has in

 

the basis of responsibility, rather | so many other areas in the past?

with the planets. Besides what can
you do with a sun that is 93 mil-
lion miles away? Poets have always
believed that the sun rises in the
east and sets in the west over a
flat earth.” Mr. Frye, in short, lived
up to his awesome reputation.
Pulitzer Winner Lowell

I think that the students knew
that Robert Lowell had won a Pu-
litzer Prize because he, unlike Mr.
Eberhart, read to a capacity audi-
ence at the Troubadour Theatre. Mr.
Lowell’s introductions to his poems
were as entertaining as his poetry
was beautiful. The audience learned
as much about skunks, General
Hooker, Ford Madox Ford, and Vil-
lon as it did about good poetry. Mr.
Lowell was obviously pleased with
his reception.

‘

Now, more about the “attendance
problem.” First, what the Univer-
sity needs is a positive attitude to-
ward these festivals. There is no
need to be apologetic about them.
If Mr. Eberhart was rather unfor-
tunate, in that he spoke to small au-
diences, perhaps this was due to
the Festival’s slow start. Other art-
ists, namely Mr. Frye and Mr. Low-
ell, read and spoke to crowded au-
ditoriums.

Festival Ignored Public Relations

Secondly, the Festival lamely ig-
nored the importance of “good pub-
lic relations,” in the jargon of the
Journalism school. One member of
the English Department so much as
admitted that there should be stu-
dent participants in the Glasgow

Republicans Raise Eyebrows
As Democrats Raise ‘Taxes

Although to the casual glance Re-
publicans and Democrats may ap-
pear to be almost indistinguishable,
here are some hints which should re-
sult in positive identification:: :

Democrats seldom make good polo
players. They would rather listen to
Bela Bartok.

The people you see coming out of
wooden churches are Republicans.

Democrats Buy Banned Books

Democrats buy most of the books
that have been banned somewhere.
Republicans form censorship com-

Republicans are likely to have
fewer but larger debts that cause
them
a lot of small bills. They don’t worry
either.

Republicans Clean Brushes

almost always clean their paint}
brushes.

Democrats give their worn-out!
clothes to those less fortunate. Re- |
publicans wear theirs.

Republicans post all the signs say-
ing No Trespassing and These Deer
Are Private Property, and so on.
Democrats bring picnic baskets and
start their bonfires with the signs.

Republicans employ exterminat-
ors. Democrats step on the bugs.

 

Governesses and Grandmothers
Republicans have governesses for |
their children. Democrats have |
grandmothers.
Democrats name their children af- |
ter currently popular sports figures, |
politicians and entertainers. Repub-
lican children are named after their |
parents or grandparents, according |
to where the most money is. |
Large cities such as New York |
are filled with Republicans—up un- |

As Generals Romp To 83-59 Win

Rodger Fauber and Brett Thacks-

two-man wrecking crew much to the
sorrow of Bridgewater College Mon-
day.

With Fauber tallying 23 points and

15th Spot
In Road Race

Seven members of the Washington
and Lee cross-country team enter-

Vista road race Saturday and lived
to tell the story.

Senior co-captain Mike Shank
paced the W&L runners with a
15th place finish. Shank’s time was

Following Shank were freshman
Riff O'Connor in 21st; Mack Brown-

Clyde Foshee in 40th; Rick Rogers
in 41st; and Scott Lavery in 50th.

Senior co-captain Brownlee won

Rockbridge County.

Wake Forest's John Carter paced
the field with an excellent 35:18.2

posting an embarrassing 69-57 win.

The Fauber-Thackston success re-
minded fans of the one-two punch
which kayoed W&L’s big brother to
the north—the University of Vir-
ginia—in 1960.

Fauber carried the load the first
half with 11 points. Thackston as-
sisted with six.

In the second half, the 5-9 senior
guard took the spotlight, sinking
his specialty—long jump shots—
for 14 points while Fauber added
another 12.

The Generals played without jun-
ior forward Tom Supak, who was
ill, but didn’t seem to miss his
15.0 scoring average.

Sophomore guard Louie Paterno
joined Fauber and Thackston in
the double figure scoring column
with ten points, all in the first half.

There was no comparison of the
Bridgewater game with the opening
performance. The Generals were
vastly improved, both offensively
and defensively.

Only damage the Eagles could in-
flict came on close in shots. Their
long-range attack was completly
stifled by the aggressive Washing-
and Lee defense.

Howard Martin and Fauber shar-
ed the rebounding honors for the
Generals with 12 apiece. The Gen-
erals outrebounded Bridgewater,
57-41.

Thackston really had a hot night

sank seven of 17 for 41.2 per cent.

Washington and Lee’s team per-
centage from the floor was a neat
42.2 per cent. Bridgewater managed
39.9 per cent.

Friday the Generals just were not
a mateh for the  better-coached
Lebanon Valley outfit. Hardly any-
thing they did went right.

For 12 minutes the Generals
stayed in the game, tying the score
six times. After that W&L just
could not cope with the Flying
Dutchmen.

Lebanon Valley broke into the
lead for keeps at the 12-minute
mark, 18-16, and pushed its margin
to 42-35 by halftime.

Then the bomb fell. The second
half, usually W&L’s stronger peri-
od, was strictly a one-team show—
all Lebanon Valley.

The Flying Dutchman really took
to the airways. In the second half’s
first 15 minutes, they completely de-
molished the W&L defenses and
held the Generals’ offensive output
to a mere nine points as they raced
to a 68-44 lead.

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Sports Editor

Palm reading, star gazing, and fortune telling are not by
any means popular professions in this cozy little college town,
but on the spur of the moment last week it seemed like it might
be the right time to renew acquaintance with an old magical
friend—my crystal ball.

With the basketball season just beginning and my trusty
old pal collecting dust on the shelf, a fling into the realm of
prognostication was in order.

A Friday afternoon consultation with my occult friend
brought this Delphic message:

With returnees such as Rodger Fauber, Brett Thackston,
Tom Supak, and Louie Paterno, W&L can expect a somewhat
improved season, but beware of the lurking misfortune.’”

Still a little bewildered by this prophecy, I eagerly dashed
to the gym for the opening game with Lebanon Valley.

Two hours and many groans later, I trudged back into my
tidy dorm room well aware of the wisdom of the occult.

Desolation hadn’t set in, however, the Generals had an-
other game Monday at Bridgewater. If they could win this one,
a successful season might be in sight. If not, oh well, we could
wait until next year.

Sunday night I shined my crystal ball to sparkling brillance
and sought its next forecast. Again it offered a message clothed
in mysterious language. “Road trips rarely bring success, but
this one could be an exception if the stars are right.”

The stars—Rodger Fauber and Brett Thackston—were
never better Monday night as they collected DC points in pac-
ing the Generals to an 83-59 triumph over the Eagles.

Elated by the news of Washington and Lee’s first victory,
I rushed to the reliable crystal in hopes of securing a prediction
for the season.

“There are many games yet to go, and wins are hard except
at home. A 6-10 record is a possibility.”

A 6-10 record seems slightly pessimistic. With any luck at
all the Generals ought to be able to make a much brighter 8-8.

Washington and Lee’s talented

“| wrestling team overcame an 11-0

lead Monday and toppled Old Do-
minion’s highly ranked club, 17-11,
at Norfolk.

Four straight decisions by Tom
Stover in the 147-pound class, Dick
Albert at 157, Pete Winfield at 167,
and Jud Babcock at 177 boosted the
Generals into a 12-11 advantage with

Heavyweight Sam Block clinched
the win for the Generals when he
pinned Old Dominion’s Fred Bishop

Stover posted an easy 11-4 win

Winfield, and Babcock had real close
wins. Albert triumphed, 4-2; Win-
field won, 5-3, and Babcock came out
on top, 3-1.

Old Dominion jumped off to a

cisioned Butch West, 3-0, in the 123-
pound weight class, and Tom Crowl-
ing beat tri-captain Dave Montgom-
ery for the second straight year, 9-0.

Henry Silverman, the Monarchs’
top wrestler, then put them on the
road to what appeared a sure vic-
tory when he pinned freshman Jerry
Reeves in 1:18.

But Stover, tri-captains Albert and
Babcock, Winfield, and Block ended
the Monarchs’ dreams of victory,
and avenged a 24-8 loss to the Nor-

HAPPY TALK

As we all know, conversation is terribly important on a date.
When lulls in the conversation run longer than an hour or two,
one’s partner is inclined to grow logy—even sullen. But oc-
casionally one finds it difficult to keep the talk going, especially
when one is having a first date with one. What, then, does one do?

If one is wise, one follows the brilliant example of Harlow
Thurlow.

Harlow Thurlow prepares. That is his simple secret. When
Harlow is going to take out a new girl, he makes sure in advance
that the conversation will not languish. Before the date, he
goes to the library and reads all 24 volumes of the encyclopedia
and transcribes their contents on his cuffs. Thus he makes sure
that no matter what his date’s interests are, he will have ample
material to keep the conversation alive.

Take, for example, Harlow’s first date with Priscilla de
Gasser, a fine, strapping, blue-eyed broth of a girl, lavishly
constructed and rosy as the dawn.

Harlow was, as always, prepared when he called for Priscilla,
and, as always, he did not start to converse immediately. First
he took her to dinner because, as everyone knows, it is useless
to try to make conversation with an unfed coed. Her attention
span is negligible. Also, her stomach rumbles so loud it is diffi-
cult to make yourself heard.

   

AE

p

Wash yur Cur and be wy loo!"

So he took her to a fine steak house where he stoked her with
gobbets of Black Angus and mounds of French fries and thick-
ets of escarole and battalions of petit fours. Then, at last,
dinner was over and the waiter brought two finger bowls.

“T hope you enjoyed your dinner, my dear,” said Harlow,
dipping into his finger bowl.

“Oh, it was grandy-dandy!” said Priscilla. “Now let’s go
someplace for ribs.”

“Later, perhaps,” said Harlow. “But right now, I thought
we might have a conversation.”

“Oh, goody, goody, two-shoes!” cried Priscilla. “I been
looking everywhere for a boy who can carry on a intelligent
conversation.”

“Your search is ended, madam,” said Harlow, and pulled
back his sleeves and looked at his cuffs to pick a likely topic to
“— the conversation.

h, woe! Oh, lackaday! Those cuffs on which Harlow had
painstakingly transcribed so many facts—those cuffs on which
he had noted such diverse and fascinating information—those
cuffs, I say, were nothing now but a big, blue blur! For Harlow
—poor Harlow!—splashing around in the finger bowl, had gotten
his cuffs wet and the ink had run and not one word was legible!
And Harlow—poor Harlow!—looked upon his cuffs and broke
out in a night sweat and fell dumb.

“T must say,” saiel Priscilla after several silent hours, “that

you are a very dull fellow. I’m leaving.”

With that she flounced away and poor Harlow was too

crushed to protest. Sadly he sat and sadly lit a cigarette.

All of a sudden Priscilla came rushing back. “Was that,” she

asked, ‘‘a Marlboro you just lit?”
“Yes,” said Harlow.

_“Then you are not a dull fellow,” she cried, and sprang into
his lap. “You are bright! Anybody is bright to smoke such a
perfect joy of a cigarette as Marlboro which is just chock full
of yummy flavor, which has a Selectrate filter which comes in a
soft pack that is really soft, and a Flip-Top Box that really flips,
and which can be bought wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty
states and Duluth . . . Harlow, tiger, wash your cuffs and
be my love.”

“Okay,” said Harlow, and did, and was. © 1062 Max Sbulmae
* * *

The makers of Marlboro cigarettes, who print this column
at hideous expense throughout the school year, are very
happy for Harlow—and for all the rest of you who have dis-
covered the pleasures of Marlboro.

Endowment program. The students’
presence would at least help to
eliminate the false impression that
these festivities are planned by the
faculty, for the faculty.

What might these students do?
Make short announcements in fra-
ternity houses before the festival,
not just listing merely the literary
calendar. If the University has a
Pulitzer Prize winner on campus,
why not say so? Freshmen dorm
Counselors might also hold ten min-
ute meetings before the Festival to
urge freshmen to participate. The
importance of personal contact,
made by students with other stu-
dents, cannot be over stressed. This
contact would at least supplement
and improve any information which
students might receive from a glance
at a crowded black and white poster.

Faculty Endorsements

What might the faculty do? First,
every professor should enthusiastic-
ally endorse the lecture series, and
not be satisfied to premptorily an-
nounce that so and so will speak at
a particular time. Secondly, as these
programs are planned in advance,
the faculty should support them by
assigning no conflicting papers and
hour quizzez. No matter how much
a student would like to attend a
reading or lecture, he will not do so
if he had a quiz or a paper the next
day. Thirdly, professors should not
let lectures die outside duPont
auditorium. I have heard only one
class discussion of a Seminar of a
Glaegow lecturer at this University
in four years. This is strange to say
the least for at least three Festival
lectures were directly concerned

Refo Calls Program Success

Despite Poor Student Support

| with class work in as many courses.
Student-Speaker Discussions

Thirdly, can the student body’s
contact with festival participants be
improved? I should think that most
students would find it extremely
difficult to discuss William Blake
with the learned Dr. Frye in a sem-
inar. However, such a discussion
could be successful if such a discus-
sion were moderated by a professor.
Several members of the faculty,
notably Mr. MacDonald, have mod-
erated such discussions, and have
done so successfully.

Fourthly, I should think that the
University would want to evaluate
the success of a concentrated pro-
gram with several speakers, as we
recently had, with that of a sus-
tained program with perhaps only
one participant. Mr. Eberhart’s com-
ments on the nature of the writer-
in-residence program at Dartmouth
College would appear to make the
sustained program, at least from the
viewpoint of a better student-writ-
er relationship more attractive. Still,
an immediate, concentrated program
is sound. It avoids the problem of
the writer-in-residence who does
not really fulfill his contract, and

it is probably better adapted to
money now available for literary
festivals.

Again, a constructive attitude is
important. I think, without any
doubt, that the Glasgow and Semin-
ar readings and lectures were suc-
cessful, both from the audience’s
viewpoint and from the poet’s view-
point. Now this University, both
faculty and students, must work to
make the next Festival even more
successful,
