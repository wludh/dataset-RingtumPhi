Dr. Fishwick
Takes Post
With Wemyss

The resignation of Dr. Marshall
W. Fishwick as professor of Ameri-
can studies at Washington and Lee
University was announced today by
Dr. William W. Pusey, III, Dean of
the College.

Dr. Fishwick has been on leave
of absence from Washington and Lee
during the current school year, serv-
ing as director of the Wemyss Foun-
dation of Wilmington, Del. Dr. Fish-
wick will continue to direct the ac-
tivities of the foundation, which
conducts research and study projects
in the fields of American history
and other American studies.

An energetic scholar, and au-
thor, Dr. Fishwick joined the
Washington and Lee faculty in
1949 as an assistant professor. He
is the author of numerous articles
and books, the latest a volume
dealing with Lee After the War,
an account of Robert E. Lee’s
presidency of Washington college.
Dr. Fishwick was on leave from
Washington and Lee during the
1958-59 session as a lecturer in Den-
mark under the State Department’s
Fulbright program, and again dur-
ing the 1961-62 term when he lec-

tured in Germany under similar
auspices.
Having attended the University

of Virginia and received his doc-
torate from Yale University, Dr.
Fishwick is the author of eleven
books, many of these having to do
with General Lee, and _ historical
Virginia.

(Continued on page 4)

 

The new plan will allow an
entering student, if he wishes, to
defer one of the subjects now
taken in the freshman year (Eng-
lish, history, foreign language,
natural science, mathematics or an
ancient language) to his sophomore
year.

In it place he may substitute work
in courses numbered below 150 or
(for which he has the prerequisites)
from the distribution requirements
for his degree.

Thus certain “sophomore” courses
in economics, fine arts, history, phil-
osophy, political science, psychology,
religion and sociology will be avail-
able for freshmen.

As before he must take Physical
Education 1-2 and may elect Military
Training 1-2.

Dean Pusey stated that the Uni-
versity believes that basic knowledge
in the present required categories
is essential to the early academic
preparation of a student, and thus
if a freshman does not choose work
from one of the present require-
ments in favor of selecting an

Gulf Oil Gives
WEL $808 Grant

The Gulf Oil Corp. has given
Washington and Lee University $808
in unrestricted funds through its aid
to education program.

Announcement of the grant was
made today by university President
Fred C. Cole. It is the fourth such
gift Washington and Lee has re-
ceived under the Direct Grants to
Independent Colleges section of the
Gulf educational program.

“This year’s increased grant is a
further indication of the interest
of Gulf in aiding higher education,”
President Cole said.

The grant was made on the basis
of data obtained by Gulf officials
from the U.S. Office of Education,
the Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare and the American
Alumni Council.

Compile

4-2 Record In Tourney

Washington and Lee debaters won four and lost two rounds
in the National Invitational Cherry Blossom Tournament at
Georgetown University this weekend.

Bill Noell and Al Eckes, the top*--—-———

W&L duo, debated the affirmative
and negative sides alternately in
compiling the record.

The Georgetown Tournament,
for fifteen years one of the biggest
debating events in the East, at-
tracted eighty-two teams this year,
including many of the nation’s
best.

Noell and Eckes went to the wire
before losing their last round in
the meet, barely missing a spot in
the final competition among the 16
teams who had lost not more than
one round.

Winners in the big tournament
were: the two Harvard teams, Wis-
consin State, St. Peter’s, Navy
Wichita, the two Brandeis teams,
St. Joseph, Holy Cross, Dartmouth,
T.C.U., Penn State, St. John’s, M.LT.,
and Wayne State. The only teams
to beat Washington and Lee were
Brandeis, of Boston, and Texas
Christian. Brandeis won the meet.

Each team entered debated six
other teams assigned beforehand ac-
cording to geographical distribution.
The listings were arranged so that
schools met opponents from varying
sections of the country.

The W&L team defeated Cen-
tral State of Wisconsin, St. Joseph
of Philadelphia, Vermont Univer-
sity, and Georgetown University.
The two losses came in the third
and last rounds; one was taken
while W&L debated the affirma-
tive, and one on the negative.

The debate proposition for the
tournament was the national topic:
“Resolved, that the non-communist
nations of the world should estab-
lish an economic community.”

Mr. William Chaffin, W&L direc-
tor of forensics, commented that he
was quite pleased by the team’s
showing in the tournament. He
pointed out that Brandeis had won
the meet, and that W&L’s only losses
were at the hands of teams who
went to the final round. W&L again

hristian 63 Valedictorian

*

Pre-Med Major
Has 2.96 Ratio,
Only Two B’s

A college career which has
to its credit membership in Phi
Beta Kappa and Omicron Del-
ta Kappa was climaxed Mon-
day afternoon when R. Meade
Christian, Jr., was selected by
the faculty as the valedictorian
of the 1963 graduating class.

Only two B’s in courses totaling
four hours of work stand between
the Richmond native and a perfect
3.0 or all A average. Christian
amassed a total of 108 hours of A
work giving him a 2.96 average
through seven semesters of work.

Christian will deliver the vale-
dictory address at the Washington
and Lee commencement exercises

June 7.

In addition to scholastic pursuits,
Christian, a pre-med. major, has
been outstanding in other campus
activities. He was tapped into ODK
leadership fraternity in his junior
year and serves as the current
Washington and Lee chapter presi-
dent. His selection as Phi Beta Kap-
pa also occurred in his junior year.

Both these honors usually come
only in the senior year.

Christian is president of the Phi
Gamma Delta social fraternity and
has served as a member of the
Executive Committee for the past
two years. He is a Robert E. Lee
research scholar, freshman dormi-
tory counselor and an active par-
ticipant in intramural athletics.

Christian plans to attend Medical
School at Western Reserve Uni-
versity in Cleveland, Ohio. As of
the moment he is unsure in what
he will specialize, but pediatrics
is a_ possibility.

The two B's Christian received
were in physical education and a
course on the American Novel. The
B in the latter course came only
last semester.

Of his efforts at Washington and
Lee, Christian stated, “When I first
arrived I ‘ground’ out the grades so
I found it easier to disclipine my-
self.

“There were times when I work-
ed for grades. But in the last two
years, I have concentrated on
learning. I feel I have been for-
tunate in attending a school where
one can be a science major and
yet get a well-rounded education.”

Christian is a graduate of Thomas
Jefferson High School in Richmond.
Last summer he worked in Ghana
with a group sponsored by the
Episcopal church.

Meeting Of Independent

Union Tonight At 6:30

The newly-organized Independent Union will meet tonight to decide
on several matters of administrative importance. The meeting, to which
all nonfraternity members are invited, will be held this evening at 6:30
in Room 27 on the second floor of the Student Union.

Athletics Debate Concluded A Draw

The question “Resolved, that under W&L’'s athletic system coaches
should win,” was argued to an inconclusive finish last night at a meeting
of the Forensic Union. Hugh Trout argued affirmatively for the question,
and John Madison debated the negative side.

Votes were taken before and after the debate, and each time the nega-
tive had an advantage of one vote. There were 20 people present at the

meeting.

The affirmative advanced the idea that in a relatively weak conference
such as the CAC, W&L teams ought to win most of the time. If a coach
has the material but cannot produce wins, then he ought to be fired. The

negative questioned the right of any

person to judge the point at which

a coach ought to be fired, and reminded the audience that most W&L
teams do enjoy winning seasons year after year

EC Rejects IFC Proposal

A proposal that the classes rather than individual fraternities pay for
the Dance Set cocktail parties, sent to the Executive Committee last week
by the IFC, has been turned down. The EC voted in favor of the spirit of
the petition, but did not pass it because it would have placed the proposal
on the spring election ballot. The EC felt that this change should be
effected in some other way than in regular student body elections

“Some will argue that this new plan offers just enough var-
iance in the freshman academic program to make it appear
slightly more tantalizing than the usual staid, predetermined
dose of freshman courses, and that the plan really is not a
change at all, but a delaying tactic.

This is not the case. For one reason alone this program is
worthwhile: it will give the freshman a chance to explore, a
year earlier, a field in which he might major. The plan also
should eliminate the feeling among many freshmen that their
first year courses strap them in like a straight jacket.

We heartily welcome changes such as this one and hope
that the University will take more steps in the future to keep
its academic program abreast of the times.

Students, Faculty Closer?

The IFC-faculty conference held week before last was so
successful that most of the six groups into which those attend-
ing had divided, independently arrived at the conclusion that it
should be made an annual affair. The enthusiasm which this
indicates was not caused by the ideas which were thrown out
in discussion; many of these were the same old tunes which
have been heard for years. Enthusiasm was engendered by
the fact that the faculty and students had been able to com-
municate intimately and sympathetically with each other.

Student representatives involved in the discussions were
surprised in many cases by the degree to which the faculty
members understood and were sympathetic to the student
viewpoint. Concerning the old sore spots such as Rush and the
fraternity effects on academics, or obviously ‘touchy” matters
such as allowing girls above the first floor in the houses, the
faculty was open-minded and interested in practicality only.
This was, although it ought not to have been, a considerable
discovery to some of those present.

One of the end results of the conference, then, should be
the establishments of greater rapport between students and fac-
ulty. Now that the real closeness of the two groups has been
demonstrated, perhaps ‘‘an attitude of student-faculty coopera-
tion,” as one group put it, will be more in evidence.

 

: A Step Forward |

Today’s announcement of the liberalization of the fresh-
man academic program is but another of the strides forward
which have taken place at Washington and Lee during the
past several years. With the increasing emphasis on education,
the incoming freshman needs some lattitude in the choice of
his courses. This new plan, allowing the postponement of a
required freshman course to the sophomore year and the sub-
stitution of an elective in its place in the freshman year, should
be a distinct aid in enabling him to secure a firmer foundation
of basic learning in his first two years at W&L. This liberaliza-
tion is a wise and long needed change.

Frosh Changes Too Late

Dear Sir:

The school’s newly-announced
policy of allowing freshmen to take
one of their required course in the
sophomore year is a commendable
improvement; however, it is too late
and too limited.

The average freshman of today
has received a thorough education
covering a wide range of subjects,
and he should not be burdened with
courses which he has found un-
interesting and useless to him per-
sonally.

Warren Montgomery

Dear Sir:

My limited comprehension fails
me when I try to understand why
the Slater System is allowed to re-
tain a monopoly in feeding the fresh-
men and nonfraternity students at
Washington and Lee University.

The only possible excuse for the
fact that there has been no revolt
against Slater food—as there have
been at other schools—is that the
vast majority of students eating in
the Commons realize they will be
eating real food in fraternity houses
for the following three years. Forti-
fying themselves with the idea that
they’ve already paid for it, and that
it only last a year, the freshmen
endure Slater as they do Hell Week,
compulsory science courses, and
blind dates from Sem.

At Centre College last year sev-
eral petitions were circulated
among the student body concern-
ing the Slater System, and as a
result, there is a new outfit provid-
ing the food at Centre this year.
The new catering service is named
Saga, and serves edible food!

At Hampden-Sydney there have
been riots over the abominable lack
of quality Slater provides. I remain
firm in my belief that Washington
and Lee gentlemen are too well-
behaved to riot, even over Slater.
Perhaps, instead, the Slater people
could be convinced that they are
actually unwanted here, and leave.
Or perhaps they'll starve to death in
the Commons...

Dear Sir:

It is the time of year again when
a student walking in the vicinity of
the freshman dorms must beware of
his step or become the victim of a
well-aimed water bomb. The sun no
sooner comes out than the freshmen
begin chucking plastic bags filled
with water out their casements on-
to the heads of innocents underneath.
Such has been the case every year
since I’ve been here, and such, I
predict (Mark my word!) will be
the case again this year. It can’t
fail.

I do not wish to protest against
the immaturity, the idle adolescence
which this indicates; I merely wish

Pace’s Column

 

By TOM PACE |
I have seen only one Francois
Truffaut film. If I had not, I walk
still recommend that you see both
“Shoot the Piano Player,” and “Jules
and Jim,” for the reason that Truf-
faut is accepted by the critics whom
I read and respect as one of the
finest directors alive.

Whereas his first film, “The Four-
Hundred Blows,” staked his claim
to prominence, the two above have
supposedly secured it. Trauffaut is
a primary figure in modern cinema
and his films are of the highest
value.

“Shoot the Piano Player” is at
the Lyric now and “Jules and Jim”
begins a week from today.

“Days of Wine and Roses,’ now
playing at the State Theater, is a
good film which will be followed
by a better one, “Two for the See-
saw,” scheduled to begin Sunday.

Mitchum plays Jerry Ryan, a
Nebraska lawyer who is in New
York, tired of his wife, tired of
his job, and looking for something
new that all people want.

He finds Shirley MacLaine, who,
as Gittel Moscafi gives one of the
past year’s performances. Gittel is
an off-beat Jewish dancer, a_ soft
touch in more ways than one.

Where Jerry’s trouble had been
being coddled and cuddled, he tries
to solve it by coddling Gittel. He
makes her dependent on him, and
makes her love him for his useful-
ness. Their love and its inevitable
conclusion are the core of the film
story.

Shirley MacLaine is superb.

If one of the film’s major weak-

campus: keep away from the fresh-

nesses is that it is too talky, then
| you can be thankful that Miss

She is able to portray emotion
after emotion. She is alive, coy,
moody, lovable, witty, naive, and
surely much more. At least when
she talks, you will enjoy listening.

However, a film, because it is a
film, must be more visual than a
play. There are certain advantages
which the cinema has over the
drama, and it should exploit them
fully. This film rarely does.

Where Miss MacLaine succeeds,
Mitchum must fail. I say “must fail”

 

Stouffer talk with Ethel Vigodsky on

 

for it is hardly his fault. His char-

   

the

ReVue’s ‘Series B’ Set To Premier Soon

acter is poorly developed by the
writer.

The character is often a monoton-
ous bore, so that if Mitchum is some-
times unconvincing it means to me
that he is not a monotonous bore.
He seems miscast for there are many
dullards who may have done the
part justice.

However, Mtichum does several
seenes very well. No one can slap
a girl with a newspaper quite the
way Mitchum does.

THE INTERNATIONAL SCENE

 

Sukarno’s Indonesia: Will It Ultimately Go Communist?

By ED NORTON

Much attention in academic and
political circles, in Washington and
Moscow is being focused today on
the underdeveloped countries of
Asia or Africa.

It is here that hundreds of mil-
lions of people, just emerging from
colonial rule, are experiencing the
desire for the increased material
well-being and political and social
equality that we in the developed
nations of the West take for granted.
And in a time when total war seems
imponderable, it is in these same
countries that the West and the
Communist bloc are waging what
may well prove to be the crucial bat-
tle.

Indonesia is a typical example,
and a case study of this nation’s
economic and political difficulties
will shed light on the general
problem of the underdeveloped
countries.

Indonesia is comprised of a chain
of islands stretching from the north-
west corner of Australia to the
Malaya peninsula, the total land
area being roughly equal to that of
the United States east of the Missis-
sippi river. The estimated popula-
tion is 100 million, but 65 per cent
of these people are crowded onto
the tiny island of Java where rich
voleanie soil and a constant rain-
fall support one of the most dense
populations in the world. Borneo, the

 

largest island of the group has a
population of only about four mil-
lion.

Throughout the history of trade
between Asia and the West, Indone-
sia has been a source of valuable
raw materials. Pepper, sugar, tea,
coffee, copra, rubber, and tin are
among the valuable exports pro-
ducts, and the virtually untapped
oil reserves are the largest in Asia.
Thus Indonesia has more to work
with in known natural resources
than many underdeveloped coun-
tries, but this rich country is never-
theless in deep economic trouble.

Indonesia is still 80 per cent agri-
cultural and rural in terms of the
value of goods produced, has rela-
tively little industrialization, and the
existing industry is running at only
20 per cent capacity. Per capita in-
come stands at around $100 per
year and is not rising significantly.

With trade, money. income, and
employment heavily dependent on
a narrow range of raw materials,
the Indonesian economy is highly
unstable and subject to wide fluc-
tuation, Rice, the basic food staple
of the population is in short sup-
ply although Indonesia is _ the
fourth largest producer of rice in
the world, it is the number one
importer of rice.

Like most of the underdeveloped
countries, Indonesia’s fundamental
problem is capital accumulation

, which will enable the economy to
| raise total production faster than
the booming population growth. But
the subsistence income of most of
the population stands as an almost
insurmountable barrier to domestic
saving and capital accumulation.

To combat this dilemma, the
United States has poured aid into
Indonesia totalling $665 million since
that country’s independence in 1949.
Aid from free world nations during
the same period has amounted to
$1.5 billion as opposed to more than
$665 million in economic aid from
the Communist bloc countries.

In many instances, however, aid
from the West is highly suspect, and
the legacy of the Dutch, who ex-
ploited the Indies for three hundred
years, still rankles many Indone-
sians.

As the United States Ambassa-
dor Howard J. Jones assessed the
situation, “To the majority of
Indonesians—in fact to most of the
emerging peoples of the African
and Asian worlds—the word cap-
italism brings forth an immediate
and vivid picture of foreign con-
trol of their economy and, not in-
frequently, of foreign expolita-
tion and oppression.”

Such an economic situation is ripe
for Communist infiltration, and
President Sukarno, whom many ob-
servers rate as an economic illiterate,
is faced with political problems as
well,

 

The Indonesian Communist Party
_(P.K.L) and its satellite labor or-
ganizations are tremendously pow-
erful. Numbering roughly 3.5 mil-
lion members, the P.K.I. is believed
to be strong enough to insure its
winning an absolute majority of
elections held any time soon.

For all appearances, Indonesia
has become the Soviet Union’s
most strategic arsenal on all of
Southeast Asia.

Newsweek has compiled the fol-
lowing information: Soviet military
aid totals about one billion dollars;
150 fighters and bombers, at least
twenty of which are MIG-21 super-
sonic fighters, in addition to ground
to air missiles similar to those that
hit an American U-2 reconaissance
plane over Cuba last year are in
the hands of the air force. The navy
has acquired long range submarines,
several torpedo boats, coastal pa-
trol vessels and a 19,000 ton former
Soviet cruiser.

In the face of such aid and the
existence of an agitating and un-
usually well organized internal Com-
munist party, it is not surprising
that Sukarno treds a very fine line.
His policy has been described as
one of “consensus”—somehow man-
aging to secure the agreement of
all rival forces, when a particular
issue has to be met squarely. Thus,
he has maintained real power, but to
do so, he has been forced to do
some clever political juggling.

 

| When he faces direct Communist

pressure, Sukarno appeases them to
a degree; when these anti-West
policies show signs of causing him
difficulty, he ceases that appease-
ment, on a temporary basis.

It seems, however, that for the
first time since 1958, Sukarno’s
precarious balance is in danger of
collapse.

The friendly army has tradition-
ally been his ace-in-the-hole against
internal action by the Communist,
but the army is no longer such a
powerful ally. Communist military
aid has gone not to the army, but
to the navy and the air force. Cur-
rent reports indicate that army fore-
es, still under Sukarno’s thumb, are
conducting campaigns to win them
great public favor. Their aim is to
actively develop Indonesia’s inter-
nal structure.

To date their activities have taken
the form of road building, hospital
development, and factory construc-
tion. If such plans are successful in
winning strong popular support for
the army and its leaders, Sukarno
will again be in a superior bargain-
ing position.

Finally, Sukarno must face what
in his own estimation is a serious
threat to his nationalistic aims. Un-
der United Nations auspices the na-
tion of Malaya, the former British
territories of Sarawak, Brunei, and
North Borneo, and Singapore are to
be combined in August of this year

 

into a new nation called Malaysia.
Surkano’s public claim is that the
formation of Malaysia, which will
berder directly on Indonesia, will
mean his “encirclement by colonialist
imperalists.”

Whether done for purposes of dis-
tracting popular discontent from In-
donesia’s internal economic plight or
as an indication of his desire for
political leadership in this corner of
Asia, Sukarno’s statements are view-
ed with understandable alarm by
Western policy makers.

Since the West is committed to
the formation and the protection of
the new Malaysia state, we could not
allow Sukarno to interfere in the
affairs of the new federation. At the
same time we have no desire to
damage our less than perfect rela-
tions with the Indonesian govern-
ment or to provide Communist prop-
aganda with additional fuel of the
charge of Western imperialism. Su-
karno’s problems regarding Ma-
laysia are quite pale in comparison
to those which he could give the
West.

It is hoped that Sukarno will elect
to put Indonesia’s economic house in
order and to forget any expansion-
ist ambitions he may have. Rich na-
tural resources and a gifted and
large population offer Indonesia the
opportunity to shed her poverty,
achieve an economic breakthrough,
and lead in the development of

_ Rodger Fauber Talks Strategy With Coach McHenry

Six Golfers I

n 70s Make

Season Outlook Bright

With only two returning lettermen
W&L golf coach E. P. Twombly
faces a hard road on the way to an-
other winning season.

His club posted a 5-3 mark last
year and finished second to Virginia
Tech in the Virginia Intercollegate
Tournament.

Track Team
Welcomes 67
To Workouts

The old adage that numbers
breed success is certainly paying off
for the Washington and Lee track
team.

The team which has rolled up a
12-1 dual meet record for the last
two years has a whopping 69 out
for this year’s team.

 

Heading a list of impressive re-
turnees are middle distance star
Skip Essex, shot putter Dave Mon-
roe, javelin thrower Mickey Walk-
er, 2-mile flash Mike Shank, broad
jumpers Robin Kell, Tommy Ed-
wards, and Henry Sackett, and
sprinter Kit Kell.

With this nucleus plus several
promising freshmen and some other
returnees, Coach Norm Lord can ex-
peet another good season.

Biggest obstacle in the squad's
path to its second undefeated sea-
son in three years is the opening
meet with Old Dominion College at
Norfolk, March 29.

The Generals whipped Old Do-
minion, 85-57, last year, but the
Monarchs are much stronger this
year at home.

Several men showed good form as
the Generals whipped Bridgewater,
60-52, two weeks ago in a warm-up
meet. The Generals will meet Mt.
Saint Mary’s College in another
warm-up indoor meet March 20.

Back this season are seniors
Warren Hughes and Bill McWil-
liams. Joining them in the top six
are senior Phil Wyly, sophomores
Jim McBride and Dave Carroll
and freshman Ed Crosland.

“If our sophomores and freshmen
come through we could do all right,”
said coach Twombly.

One factor that might aid the golf-
ers is a more compact schedule. The
yenerals do not start until the sec-
ond week of April and are through
by the second week of May. This

should eliminate the usual bad
weather problems.
Toughest opponents on __ this

year’s card look like Pittsburgh,
Georgetown, and George Wash-
ington. Also on the schedule for
the first time in the College Ath-
letic Conference tournament,
which will be held here May 10-11.

Coach Twombly is optimistic about
his season because all six of his top
golfers shoot in the law to middle
golfers shoot in the low middle

“It's been a long time since I had
six golfers in the 70s,’ Twombly
said. “Nobody is going to burn up
this Lexington course, so we should
be all right. Pll certainly be happy
with six scores in the 70s.”

Football And Dogs
A Winning Duo?

Every year for the past several years the national football
rules committee has gotten together and thought up some bril-
liant new substitution rule for the good old gridiron sport.

First came the wild card. Then the double wild card ap-
peared. Now they’ve returned to the two platoon, or so it ap-
pears at first glance.

Many coaches throughout the nation have cheered or
jerred the new rules, but Washington and Lee’s McLaughlin
is probably the first coach to have actually tested the controver-
sial change.

McLaughlin became well acquainted with the new

rules during the annual Varsity-Alumni game March 2.

Every time he wanted to make a substitution, he couldn’t.
Every time he didn’t want to substitute, he could.

Wise McLaughlin Outsmarts Rules Makers

But wiley Coach Mack isn’t to be outdone by a bunch of
idle rule-makers. The smiling W&L mentor conjured up a way
out.

This way out (more secret than the Atom bomb)
has to do with discretionary time outs, dogs, and striped
shirts,

A little prying, a few questions, and considerable bribery
brought the story into full bloom.

It seems that Coach McLaughlin has suddenly become
very interested in dogs. So interested in fact, that he is starting
his own kennel.

Dogs and football are a strange combination, but
not to Coach Mac. He has a distinct football purpose
for his dogs. And all this mystery of dogs and football
concerns substitutions and rules.

Crazy?

Yes.

According to the new rules, a team can substitute an un-
limited number of men on second and third downs and only
two men on first or fourth downs but all these substitutions
must come during a time out.

The problem that arises is what does the coach do when his
team has used all of its time outs and he wants to substitute?

MARKING ON THE CURVE—AND WHAT
TO DO ABOUT IT

Twonkey Crimseott was a professor. Choate Sigafoos was a
sophomore. Twonkey Crimscott was keen, cold, brilliant.
Choate Sigafoos was loose, vague, adenoidal. Twonkey Crim-
scott believed in diligence, discipline, and marking on the curve.
Choate Sigafoos believed in elves, Julie London, and thirteen
hours of sleep each night.

Yet there came a time when Twonkey Crimscott—mentor,
sage, and savant—was thoroughly outthought, outfoxed, out-
maneuyered, outployed, and outwitted by Choate Sigafoos,
sophomore,

 

It happened one day when Choate was at the library studying
for one of Mr. Crimscott’s exams in sociology. Mr. Crimscott’s
exams were murder—plain, flat murder. They consisted of one
hundred questions, each question having four possible answers
—A, B, C, and D, You had to check the correct answer, but the
trouble was that the four choices were so subtly shaded, so
intricately worded, that students more clever by far than Choate
Sigafoos were often set to gibbering.

so on this day Choate sat in the library poring over his
sociology text, his tiny brow furrowed with concentration, while
all around him sat the other members of the sociology class,
every one studying like crazy, every one seared and pasty.
Choate looked sadly at their stricken faces. “What a waste!”
he thought. “All this youth, this verve, this bounce, chained to
musty books in a musty library! We should be out singing and
dancing and cutting didoes on the greensward! Instead we
are here.”

Then, suddenly, an absolute gasser of an idea hit Choate.
“Listen!”’ he shouted to his classmates. “Tomorrow when we
take the exam, let’s all—every one of us—check Choice ‘A’ on

every question —every one of them.”

“Huh?” said his classmates.

“Oh, I know that Choice ‘A’ can’t be the right answer to
every question,” said Choate. “But what’s the difference? Mr.
Crimscott marks on the curve. If we all check the same an-
swers, then we all get the same score, and everybody in the class
gets a ‘C’.”

“Hmm,” said his classmates.

“So why should we knock ourselves out studying?”
Choate. “Let’s get out of here and have a ball!”

So they all ran out and lit Marlboro Cigarettes and had a
ball, as indeed, you will too when you light a Marlboro, for if
there ever was a cigarette to lift the spirit and gladden the
heart, to dispel the shades of night, to knot up the ravelled
sleeve of care, to put spring in your gait and roses in your
cheeks, it is filtered Marlboros—firm and pure and fragrant and
filled with rich, natural, golden tobacco. And, what’s more, this
darlin’ smoke comes in soft packs that are actually soft and
flip-top boxes that actually flip.

Well sir, the next morning the whole class did what Choate
said, and, sure enough, they all got ‘C’s, and they picked Choate
up and carried him on their shoulders and sang ‘lor He’s a
Jolly Good Fellow” and plied him with sweetmeats and Marl
boros and girls and put on buttons which said “T DOTE ON
CHOATE.”

But they were celebrating too soon. Because the next time
shrewd old Mr. Crimscott gave them a test, he did not give
them one hundred multiple choice questions. He only gave
them one question—to wit: write a 30,000 word essay
“Crime Does Not Pay.”

“You and your ideas,” they said to Choate and tore off hi
epaulets and broke his sword and drummed him out of the
school. Today, a broken man, he earns a living as a camshaft

in Toledo.

ReVue Begins Series Seon

(Continued from page 2)

The beginning and the end are
masterful, and the film, as a whole,
is excellent.

* *

Mr. Taylor's ReVue begins series
B in a week from this Friday. The
second series promises to be even
better than the first.

Four of the films were recently
named by Sight and Sound’s Inter-
national Critics’ Poll as among the
fifteen best of all time. The two
which begin the series are two of
the four. They are films by Jean
Vigo—“L’Atalante,” and “Zero d’
Conduite.” That should be an eve-
ning of superb cinematic entertain-
ment.

Mr. Daves, at the State Theater,
has asked me to mention that he
is unable to bring three of the nom-
inees for the Academy Award—
“Lawrence of Arabia,” “The Longest
Day,” and “Mutiny on the Bounty.”

These films are at present only
for 70 millimeter projectors and
the State has only the 35. He will
try to bring them as soon as they
are available in 35.

Having mentioned three nominees,
I'll give the other two—“To kill a

Of the five, only “Mockingbird”
and “Lawrence” have any claim. The |
other three exemplify Hollywood |
commercialism, politics, and poor
taste.

“The Longest Day” is a big pro-
duction worth while for its import-
ance, but that’s all.

“Mutiny on the Bounty” is good

flict and they do this much too
seldom.
“Music Man” was a nice family

is time that the notorious Academy
Awards begin to recognize them. And
if the Academy is going to nomi-
nate a foreign film for writing and
direction, then it is time that the
foreign films are considered for best
picture.
It is amazing to me that a movie
like “Music Man” can garner sup-
port over some of the really excel-
lent films that are made. Next
Tuesday I hope to be more expilicit
and to enumerate the films which I
thought were the best of the past

mittees concentrating on separate
fields of discussion: disarmament,
finance, special items including the
admission of Red China, decade of
development and colonialism. Reso-
lutions passed by the appropriate
committees were submitted to the
floor of the plenary session for final
debate and for the Assembly’s vote.

Georgetown University, in con-
junction with Howard University,
was host to the Assembly which in-
cluded 110 colleges and _ universi-
ties. Both the delegation and _ its
regional or ideological bloc attend-
ed briefings at its own nation’s em-
