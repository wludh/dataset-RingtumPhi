'UCA Meets

For Discussion

The University Christian Asso-
ciation has recently moved into the
field of diplomacy.

In an effort to boost W&L’s re-
lationship with neighboring women’s
colleges, the UCA has begun to
sponsor a series of roundtable dis-
cussions with Hollins,
and Randolph-Macon Women’s Col-
lege.

The program originated in the fall
of 1961 when a group of sophomores
end juniors, under the auspices of
the UCA, held a joint discussion with
representatives from Hollins.
discussion led a series of W&L-
Hollins meetings which were held
periodically during the year, with
the two colleges alternating as host.

Due to the success of these meet-
ings, the UCA has extended this
program this year to Randolph-Ma-
con and Sweet Briar. The topies of
discussion have ranged from theology
to current issues.

Ashley Wiltshire, president of the

| UCA, commented that the meetings

have contributed a great deal to-
ward a_ better understanding be-
tween W&L and the girls’ colleges.
He added that he would be glad to
see any students interested in join-
ing these discussion groups.

NOTICE

The Washington Literary Society
will sponsor a lecture by Dr. S. P.
C. Duvall on Tuesday, February 19
at 7:30 p.m. in the Student Union.
Dr. Duvall will speak on Herman
Melville’ s Billy Budd.

 

There will be no Friday Ring- tum
Phi next week.

This |

is sponsored jointly by
the Washington and Lee Concert
| Guild and the Student War Memor-
|ial Scholarship Fund Committee.
Frank Young, president of
SWMSFC, stated that the primary
purpose of the concert was to help
raise money for the student schol-
arship fund, a fund established in
honor of the Washington and Lee
alumni who gave their lives in World
War II.
In addition,

Young remarked, the
represented an effort to
| provide the University with more
| variety of culture. “The concert will
also help relieve the seasonal lull
in entertainment,” Young added.

Charlie Byrd, who will appear with
his accompanists, the Village Van-
guard, plays for the Showboat
Lounge in Washington, D.C. In ad-
dition to his nightclub entertainment,
he has recorded six popular albums,
including Jazz at the Showboat,
Byrd in the Wind, and Charlie Byrd
at the Village Vanguard.

His recordings range from the
Spanish-rhythm Scherzo for an Old
Shoe to the classical sonato, Polo-
naise Pour Pietro. Supporting Byrd
are Keter Betts, bass; Buddy Dep-
penschnidt, Drum; and Bill Sum-
mers at the piano.

Byrd, a one-time student of An-
dres Segovia, has been applaud-
ed as today’s most perfected and
versatile guitarist. Playing the finger
style without the use of a pick, he
is especially praised for his success
at blending jazz and classical tech-
niques.

Max Gordon joins other critics in
a high estimation of Byrd’s skills.
He is particularly impressed by
Byrd’s “undefeated but firm ability
to command an audience’s attention.”
The improvement, he states, which
Byrd has made during his playing
| career “must be chalked up to prog-
ress—artistic progress.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Friday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

Campus

We are pleased to see the realignment of political parties
which has been announced. This adjustment has created two
parties which are fairly matched, and the result will be, hope-
fully, a stronger student government at Washington and Lee.

Without summarizing the details of the new party system
which have been given, we have several comments to make

concerning its possible effect.

Most obviously, this is something which has been needed
for a long time. The situation came to a head when Sigma Phi
Epsilon switched late last spring to the old University party,
leaving an intolerable over-balance in favor of that party. The
effect of this nine-nine balance of fraternities will be closer elec-
tions in all offices and a better chance of victory for most can-

didates.

It is also noteworthy that this shuffling of houses could not
be labeled as one big party “‘switch.’’Rather, two entirely new
political parties have been formed, and this alignment is based
neither on old relationships nor mere geographical location.
Two houses in Red Square are members of one party, while
the remaining three houses are in the other.

The test of spring elections remains, and from now until
that time, both new parties will bear a great responsibility. They
must organize, and party leaders should be selected promptly.
There will be many unfamiliar new political relationships which
will need smooth adjustment. We can be assured of well-run
elections in the spring along with the best possible candidates
from both parties before the student body only if planning for

all of this is begun now.

thing we can be fortunate for is
that we attend a School with two

5th would be Founders Day (right
in the middle of spring vacation),
since Elihu Yale was born then.

At Cornell we would get January
8th—Ezra Cornell's  birthday—but
that is right after Christmas vaca-
tion. This is during term paper
week and not an opportune time
to take vacations.

At Franklin and Marshall, Janu-
ary 17th and September 24th would
be holidays. This set-up is far bet-
ter than ours, but not ideal. A hy-
pothetical perfect situation would
exist if you went to a_ college
founded by Phineas Taylor Barnum
(of Circus fame) and John Paul
Jones (of nautical fame), and, in
addition, if you were going to sum-
mer school at this imaginary Barnum
and Jones University. Their birth-
days are July 5th and 6th respec-
tively. With July 4th a holiday for
all, you could take off for a three-
day bash.

Well, we must admit that this is
ridiculous, since neither Barnum
or Jones ever thought of founding
a college. But we can dream, can’t
we?

The best situation we could
hope for here would be if Emma
Hart Willard had by some quirk
of fate help found the college
instead of Robert E. Lee. Her
birthday falls on the 23rd of Feb-
uary—one day after George's,
and the next day being Sunday,
we could have beaten it out of
here for three days. But, we can’t
quite see the Washington and
Willard Swing. And anyway, Mrs.
Willard founded a girl's school in
Troy, New York named, strangely
enough—Emma Willard.

All in all we have one day—Feb-
ruary 22—and we wish everybody
luck with their vacation plans. Some
are going north to ski, others, south
for the sun, but if you aren’t that
ambitious or don’t have cuts at
least go to B-V for a flick next
Friday.

Speaking of flicks Rear Window is
in town now and shouldn’t be missed
by anyone who enjoys a good Al-

 

fred Hitchcock thriller.

Lewis F. Powell Fifth Alumnus
Named To Presidency Of A.B.A.

When Richmond attorney Lewis F.
Powell, Jr., steps up to the presi-
dency of the American Bar Associa-
tion in August of 1964 he will be
the fifth Washington and Lee Uni-
versity alumnus to hold the post.

A member of the university’s
Board of Trustees since 1961, Powell
was selected as president-elect des-
ignate of the ABA during the group’s
mid-year meeting last week in New
Orleans. Powell, 55, will succeed
Walter E. Craig of Phoenix, Ariz.,
the current president-elect. He will
be the 88th president of the national
legal group that was organized in
1878 and has over 102,000 members.

Only two law schools in the
nation have had more graduates
elected to the top ABA job than
Washington and Lee, according to
statistics compiled by the asso-
ciation’s central office in Chicago.
Ten graduates of Harvard Univer-
sity’s law school have held the
post and six Columbia University
alumni have served as ABA presi-
dents. Washington and Lee’s near-
est contender, the University of
Pennsylvania, has three.

The first Washington and Lee
alumnus to become president of the
ABA was Henry St. George Tucker,
who guided the association in 1904-
05. He was the dean of Washington
and Lee’s School of Law from 1899
to 1902. Dean Tucker succeeded
his father, John Randolph Tucker,
as dean of the Lexington law school.
The elder Dean Tucker was presi-
dent of the ABA in 1892-93. Al-
though he was a graduate of the
University of Virginia, Washington
and Lee informally claims him as
a “W&L man” since he was its first
law dean.

Other Washington and Lee grad-
uates to hold the ABA presidency
and their dates of office are John
W. Davis, 1922-23; Scott M. Lof-
tin, 1934-35; and Ross L. Malone,
1958-59.

Since Washington and Lee has a
relatively small law school, univer-
sity officials take special pride in
the number of law graduates who
have headed the ABA. This Sep-
tember, 142 students registered for
law and 55 of those were entering
for the first time. The new students
this year represented 35 colleges
and 18 states and Canada. There are

nine men on the Washington and
Lee law faculty.

“My feeling was one of great pride
when I learned of the selection of
one of our distinguished law gradu-
ates—Mr. Lewis F. Powell—as pres-
ident-elect designate of the Amer-
ican Bar Association,’ Law School
Dean Charles P. Light said.

“Our School of Law, one of the
smaller ones, has been similarly
honored in earlier years by the elec-
tion to the presidency of the ABA

 

ihn

Ross L. Maline

of four of its graduates and its first
dean,” Dean Light added. “This is
quite a notable record. Many of our
graduates also have served the bar
associations of their respective states
with great distinction.”

The current president of the Vir-
ginia Bar Association, Waldo G.
Miles of Bristol, is a 1938 law gradu-
ate of Washington and Lee. Miles
was named to the Virginia Board of
Education in January by Governer
Albertis Harrison.

John R. Tucker, who was 15th
president of the association, serv-
ed as Washington and Lee’s law
dean from 1870 to 1899. When the
original law school building burn-
ed in 1934 and the present three-
story edifice was built to replace
it, university officials decided to
re-name the building Tucker Hall

 

in honor of Dean Tucker's service.

 

 

Like his son, he also served in

Congress.

Henry St. George Tucker was the
27th ABA president. He died in
1932 after having served as law dean
at Washington and Lee and Colum-
bia (now George Washington Uni-
versity), seven terms in Congress
and president of the Jamestown
Exposition Co. He was dean of the
School of Law and Diplomacy at
George Washington when he was
elected ABA president. He received

Lewis F. Powell

his LL.B. from Washington and Lee
in 1876.

It was 17 years after the younger
Tucker was ABA president when
another Washington and Lee alum-
nus took the helm of the organiza-
tion, In 1922, John W. Davis, the
1924 Democratic nominee for pres-
ident, stepped up to the post as
the 45th president. Davis, who
died in 1955, was a member of the
62nd and 63rd Congresses, Solici-
tor-General of the U.S. for five
years and U.S. Ambassador to
Great Britain for three years, He
received his B.A. degree from
Washington and Lee in 1892 and
his LL.B. in 1895. When the uni-
versity opened its dormitory for
law students in 1959, it was named
in horor of Davis who had been a
trustee and the university Rector.

 

 

In the mid-1930’s, Jacksonville at-

torney Scott M. Loftin was appointed
to fill the unexpired term of Florida
Senator Park Trammell who died
unexpectedly. Senator Loftin, who

attended Washington and Lee in
1898 and 1899 and received an
honorary LL.D. degree from his

Alma Mater in 1934, served in the
U.S. Senate for five months. He was
the 58th president of the ABA in
1934-35, a year before his Senate
appointment. He died in 1953.

When Ross L. Malone of Rose-
well, New Mexico, was elected
82nd ABA president in 1958 he was
the youngest man to be named to
the office in 80 years. His Alma
Mater honored him with an hon-
orary LL.D. degree that year and
students elected him a member of
the Washington and Lee chapter of
Omicron Delta Kappa. He is a
partner in the Rosewell firm of
Atwood and Malone and a fellow
of the American College of Trial
Lawyers. He received his Bachelor
of Laws degree from Washington
and Lee in 1932.

According to a mid-week national
news story on Powell, the word
“enthusiastic” comes up quite fre-
quently in conversations with the
Richmond attorney. This might well
be a key word for the soft-spoken
man whose activities range from
coaching a Little League baseball
team in Richmond to dealing with
major corporate and educational
problems throughout Virginia. Be-
sides being a trustee of Washing-
ton and Lee, he is a member of the
board of trustees of Hollins College
and the Virginia Board of Educa-
tion,

President-elect designate Pow-
ell is a senior member of the firm
of Hunton, Williams, Gay, Powell
& Gibson and has practiced law
in Richmond for over 30 years. In
1960, Washington and Lee awarded
him an honorary LL.D. degree. He
earned both his B.S. and LLB.
degrees from the university and
an LL.M. degree from Harvard
University. Hampden-Sydney Col-
lege gave Powell a LL.D. degree
in 1959.

As president of the American Bar
Association, Powell will have to take
time from his busy law practice
and associations with a number of

Physical Fitness Strikes Out Louis Macferb

By SANDY FENN
Friday Columnist

Louis Macferb was a normal, mal-
adjusted member of the Washington
and Lee Student body, and until
recently, he was very happy in this
unenlightened state of existence. He
was. short and
plump and rather
pear-shaped, but
in spite of this, he
never had any
trouble finding
short, plump pear-
shaped dates from
the nearby girls’
schools. Louis was
getting along quite
well until Mr.
Kennedy's pro-
gram of physical

 

fitness began to sweep the country.

One day Louis raised his head
from a pitcher of brew at Doc’s, blew
the cigarette smoke from his lungs
in a wheezing, broken stream, and
realized that he no longer repre-
sented the mainstream of American
youth. To Louis’ astonishment and
horror the whole country was caught
up in a fad of physical fitness. No
longer could the critics talk in
sneering tones about the “soft un-
derbelly of American youth,” be-
cause American youth was “tighten-
ing up.”

For several weeks Louis brooded
quietly in his dormitory room,
took up smoking a pipe, and lived
on Metrecal wafers. Then in a
fit of despair he tried to hang
himself in his closet. Unfortunately
his 98c Leggett’s tie was not strong
enough to support his short, plump,
pear-shaped body while he twist-
ed, kicked, and gasped his life
away. Therefore, the tie broke
even before his face had a chance
to turn a spectacular purple color
and he was unceremoniously
dumped into his dirty clothes pile.

After this ill-fated chance to
achieve greatness, Louis went to see
a head shrinker. This sage man ad-
vised him to “bend with the wind”
and become one of America’s “new

breed.” For several weeks Louis
valiantly endeavored to follow this
advice. He trundled into Pres

| Brown’s and bought a sweatsuit, a
| pair of tenny-pumps, and other as-
sorted gruesome paraphenalia. He
determined to run a mile every day
and to do calisthenics and isometric
exercises to boot.

It was drizzling softly under grey
skies when Louis began his first
workout. Eagerly he set off in his
new sweats and tenny-pumps. He
held his head high and ran like
a young deer (a short, plump, pear-
shaped young deer). After approx-
imately 100 yards he staggered and

“Who makes the decisions?” This |
is probably the single most important |
question one could ask in an at- |
tempt to discover the underlying
power basis of any society, whether
it be nation or tribe.

Most Americans naively believe
that important decisions in our
country are made by the elected
representatives of the people, that
these representatives actually re-
flect percentage-wise the interests of
the people, and that diverse inter-|
ests are so “balanced” that no one
interest or group of interests dom- |}
inates or controls the others, and that
the representatives of the people
are directly responsible to them and}
can be replaced at any time if they
fail to do as the people wish.

In a cogent and well-documented
book, The Power Elite, sociologist
C. Wright Mills effectively explodes
these false notions, which are based
on the realities and myths of the
past.

According to Mills, the important
decisions in America—the decisions
that determine the political and eco-
nomic conditions of our country and
affect the daily lives of our fellow
citizens—are made, controlled, or
presided over by a relatively small
and increasingly close-knit group of
men, “the power elite.” This group

reeled to a halt. His breath came
in burning gasps, his feet ached,
his right leg cramped, his head
spun, his eyes rolled backwards,
and he fainted face down in a pile
of slush.

Louis gave up his running routine
and devoted himself to calisthenics
and isometric exercises. He progress-
ed admirably for three days. Then in
a burst of overconfidence he held his
arm curl exercises for fifteen sec-

 

onds instead of only five, he for-
got to hold his breath, and he pro-

Kirkley Reports On “The Power Elite’
Asks Who Makes Decisions In American Society

Warlords or Military Ascendancy;
and the Political Directorate.

This power elite is not an aristoc-
racy, for it is not formal and ob-
vious; it is not actually a class, for
it is not completely aware of itself,
nor are others fully aware of it; and
it is not really a club or organiza-
tion, for its membership require-
ment, social rituals, and shared ac-
tivities, though generally known and
recognized by the in-group, are
not explicit.

Yet, though the power elite cannot
be classified in one of the above
categories, it does possess attributes
of each of them. And what is more
important for our nation and our
people, the members of this power
elite are becoming more and more
aware of themselves as a group
possessing common standards, com-
mon goals, and common means of
achieving those goals as they in-
crease in power, affluence, and in-
fluence,

A major factor contributing to the

members of the power elite is their
common background. About 90 per
cent of these decision-makers were
born into families in the upper
quarter of the income and occupa-
tional status-pyramids of this coun-
try. Their fathers were generally of
profesisonal or entrepreneural status,
if not among the corporate rich of

 

earlier generations; they are usually

duced a magnificent double hernia.

This unforeseen catastrophe not
only shattered his self-confidence
and will to live, it also sever-
ely limited his social life, since
he had to undergo an operation to
correct this rather unfortunate
malady. While he was recovering
from this ordeal, his favorite short,
plump, pear-shaped date, Erma
Frabbish, got pinned to the captain
of the UVa. football team. When
this news reached Louis in the

Episcopalian or Presbyterian, or per-
haps Congregational or Unitarian;
most of them attended an Ivy League
College; preferably Harvard or Yale,
though the military ascendancy
would have atended Anapolis or
The Point, and the corporate rich
probably a private Eastern prep
school, such as Choate or Groton
as well.

,

Members of the power elite dis-
tinguished each other by family
background, wealth, education, man-
ners, and, principally, by the po-
sitions which they occupy and the
amount of direct control which they
possess over others in the corporate,
military, or governmental bureauc-
racies. This group is net itself a
bureaucracy, which is a middle class
term, or is it subject to the machin-
ations of a bureacuracy; it is the
group which sets the standards for
admisison to the bureaucracies which
it controls, determines what func-
tions that bureaucracy will perform,
and decides who in the bureaucracy
will rise in power.

Many sociologists, anthropologists,
and philosophers of our day have
devoted themselves to the study and
description of modern mass society.
And, according to Mills, they have
diagnosed correctly the feelings of
anomie, marginality, and normless-
the sence of impotence, the
conformity, the inefficacy of these

Maryland is in the truest sense

But Coach Norris Eastman feels

opportunities for new pool records

Our basketball record for the season rests at 4-10. Why?

Can Roanoke College be considered a Small College

Is team spirit lacking, or does the school fail in supporting

Are we lacking in player talent?

Is the coach responding to playing techniques?

Are the facilities conducive to good besketball?

Is there any hope for improvement for the next year?

feated status.

Wrestling in the 130 pound class,
Montgomery’s season record is 5-1
and his 4-year slate at W&L now
stands at an impressive 26-7. Three
of his five wins this season have
been by pins.

Coach Miller calls Dave a good,
all-rounded wrestler. His statistics
readily prove this. He leads the grap-
plers in reversals and his three pins
place him second in that department.
He has given up only five points to
all of his opponents this season, an
average of less than one point per
match.

Dave has been co-captain of the
wrestling team for two years now,
and has served the team well in
that position. He is steady and re-
liable. Coach Miller feels that Dave
has served as an inspiration to
other team members.

Of Roanoke College; 77-72

Fighting a tough, uphill battle the
Washington and Lee basketball team
fell just short of upsetting a rough
Roanoke College five Wednesday
night at Salem, Va. Behind by as
much as twenty points at times, the
Generals fought back and at one
point were only two points down.

Perhaps one of the deciding fac-
tors in the game was the General’s
slow start in the first half. Where-
as the Generals were having
trouble sinking the ball, the Roa-
nokers were having trouble miss-
ing. Roanoke’s Cregger and Bak-
er did most of the scoring in the
first half with Cregger hitting from
the floor and Baker adding an
even 100 per cent from the foul
line. With this one-two combina-
tion Roanoke was safely in the
lead at the end of the first half,
36-27,

With the start of the second half
it looked as if the Generals would
continue at their original slow pace.
Then, with about eleven minutes
left in the game, the team suddenly
found the basket. Fauber and Pater-
no began to hit consistently. Coach
McHenry put in his press and Roa-
anoke slowed down like a car that

ran out of gas. Don Wallis and Tom

rest of the team. With about six
minutes left the Generals were
within two points of Roanoke and it
looked as if they might overtake
them.

Too Many Whistles

At this point, one of the men in
black and white got whistle happy
and W&L became the victim of un-
usual foul trouble. Roanoke’s Sim-

consequently pulled his team out
of the fire by sinking most of his

masses. But these are the trends
prevalent on the middle levels of
our social order and the theories
of power held by the masses apply
only to the middle levels of power
in America—to the bureaucracies,
to the rank-and-file business, gov-
ernment, and the military, and to
the Congress of the United States.

But the real answer to the ques-
tion, “Who makes the big decisions?”
is this: it is the power elite.

The facts have shifted during the
years. The power elite is hidden
from the view of the masses because
it is not formal or institutional and
because its workings are cloaked in
the garb of “Military secrecy” or
“the best interests of the people.”
The power elite is not a conspiracy,
and it is not actually a unified, co-
herent organization seeking to gain
power and control over the people
of the United States to promote its
own ends.

But it does have power, and it
does exercise control; and if this

control is the best for the country,
it is simply because the interests of
the power elite happen to coincide
with those of the country as a whole.
And it is probably true that the
members of the power elite regard
themselves as acting in the best in-
terests of the country, since they
are all good Americans—white,
Protestant, financially secure, well-
educated, parents.

Whether, in fact, this power elite
does decide issues in a way bene-
ficial to the whole country is a
matter for the reader to decide.

The most provocative question is
this: If the power elite does become
aware of itself, and if it does come
to serve its own interests rather
than those of the country which
has created it, can it possibly be ef-
fectively opposed?

Fenn Reveals Tragedy of Louis Macferb

(Continued from page 2)

infirmary, he went into a severe
decline, and the medical experts
there feared for his life.

However, a virtual miracle occur-
red this week which brought Louis
back from the brink of the grave.
And strangely enough, just as Mr.
Kennedy’s “New Frontier” had
nearly driven this short, plump,
pear-shaped, normally maladjusted
representative of the soft under-
belly of American youth to his death,
so the “New Frontier” snatched
poor Louis from the brink of Eterni-

| ty.

What was the momentous event
which saved Louis’ life and showed
him he was not out of step with his
times? Why, it was Pierre Salinger’s
renunciation of his proposed 50-
mile walk, which read in part as
follows:

“I may be ‘plucky,’ but I am not
stupid. I am moved not only by the
generous advice volunteered by
many doctors, but also by my com-
passion for those members of the

 

press corps who might have been
forced to participate in this under-
taking....The fitness of the entire
Administration has been amply dem-
onstrated by Attorney General Rob-
ert F. Kennedy’s 50-mile trek last
Sunday.”

...and what’s good enough for
the pear-shaped members of the
“New Frontier” is certainly good
enough for Louis Macferb.

be the deciding factor of the game
as W&L lost its tenth game of the

“Bip” Fauber played an excellent
game and was the game’s second
