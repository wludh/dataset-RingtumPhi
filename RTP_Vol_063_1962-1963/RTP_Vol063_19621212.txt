Washington and Lee under the auspices of the Seminars in

literature.

His talk is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. January 11 in the Fine

length, in Harper’s Magazine, This
was the first time in its history
that Harper's had published an
entire novel in a single issue.

The novel won almost unanimous
praise from reviewers and critics on
its publication and has been nomi-
nated for the National Book Award
for 1962. Such figures of the literary
world as Stephen Spender, Lord
David Cecil, and Eudora Welty
singled it out for special comment
and commendation.

Spender said: “I think this is

the most remarkable novel by a
young writer which I have read
for many years. It is a most mov-

Student Literary Magazine
Makes Debut On Campus

By JULIAN MARKHAM

Ariel, a literary review writ-

ten and published by Wash-| liam B. Lowry, Jr.;

ington and Lee students, made
its campus debut this Wednes- |
day.

Published entirely without | tion, contributor Bill Lowry com-

either faculty supervision or |
University financial assistance,
the first issue of Ariel com-
pletes several months of fund
raising, organization, and _lit-
erary effort by Editor and

and his staff.

Refo commented in the first edition
that the continued publication of
Ariel was assured “through the gen-
erous support of the University,
both students and faculty; through

 

the support of neighboring colleges, |

and through advertisements.”
Focus

The focus of the Autumn issue of
Ariel is the “Theatre of the Absurd.”
This, and allied aspects of the ab-
surd in politics and philosophy are
discussed in the issue. The maga-
zine’s content also includes book re-
views and poetry as well as a report

| on the recent American Poetry Fes-

tival.

THE NEW language laboratory in duPont Hall.

‘ Significance
Business Manager John Refo|

Ariel’s contributors include: John |

| F. Refo; Andrew Adelson; C. P.
| White, Jr.; Franklin Carlisle; Wil-
Tim Morton;

Phillip Reidford; and John Dunnell.
| All are seniors at Washington and
| Lee.

When asked about Ariel’s recep-

mented that: “A lot of people are
very encouraged to see something
like this.” Lacking specific data as
to circulation and reviews, he could
only infer, from personal conversa-
tion, that the public respense has
been warm.

 

Discussing the significance of Ariel |
in relation to other publications on |
campus, Lowry stated that whereas
a surprising number of Washington |
and Lee students write, they “have |

no outlet, and receive little en-
couragement with the exception of
the English Department’s Mahan
Awards. Therefore, Ariel fills a def-
inite need.” Speaking of his belief
that a great deal of latent student
interest exists “in this sort of thing,”
Lowry said that a “publication such
as Ariel should help to bring it out.”
When asked about Ariel’s future,
Lowry answered for Refo, who is
taking Rhodes Scholarship Exams in
Charlottesville today, saying that
two additional issues will be pub-
lished this year. The first of these
he said, would probably use stu-
dent fiction as its main theme.
Students interested in purchasing
copies of Ariel may do so either at
the Co-op or the Book Shop. Sub-

scriptions are still available and may
be obtained by contacting either)
John Refo or Bill Lowry.

To Perform With Trio

By STEVE GUILD
Managing Editor

Nina Simone, jazz pianist and singer, has been signed by

the Dance Board for the Fancy Dress Concert, February

The concert, which will be held in Doremus Gymnasium
from 8 to 10 Saturday night will feature both Miss Simone and

Conservative
Society Holds
Meeting Here

Approximately 60 students from
Virginia colleges attended the “Con-
ference on Conservatism” sponsored
by the Washington and Lee Conser-
vative Society on this campus last
week. Delegates at the conference
included those from W&L, Hollins,
Randolph-Macon Men and Women’s
colleges, Sweetbriar, and UVa.

In the afternoon, the Eastern Di-
rector of the Intercollegiate Society
of Individualists, Robert Lucock,
spoke on the purpose and function
of his organization, and on _ the
founding of ISI-affiliated college or-
ganizations. Discussion groups led
by Wyatt Durette and Joe Freeman,
Presidents of the W&L and UVa.
Conservative Societies respectively,
and by Bill Braithwaite, Managing
Editor of W&L’s Southern Conser-
vative, followed.

Following a banquet at the Robert
E. Lee Hotel, Dr. Gordon Tullock,
economics professor at UVa.., spoke
on “The Rift Between Russia and
Red China.” Dr. Tullock envisioned
a “steadily developing emotional
hatred” developing between these
two countries. Tullock said _ that
this was attributable to three basic

facts: 1) Red China’s traditional
role as “junior partner” in the re-
lation between Russia and China;

2) Mao Tse-tung’s resentment at this
surbordination and his determina-
tion to obtain leadership; and 3) the
constant dispute of Russia and China
over the Siberian and Manchurian
boarders.

Dr. Tullock also pointed out ap-
parent “signs of mental decay in Mao
Tse-tung and the Red Chinese gov-
ernment which has been “exempli-
fiied by a steady decline in her gross
national product over the last four
years.” The proper course for the
United States is to attempt to widen
the Russia- Chinese breach.

 

—*her trio.

The appearance of Nina Simone
coincides with the rest of the Fancy
Dress activities which include the
“Playboy” cocktail party Friday
afternoon and the Civil War Fancy
Dress Ball with Count Basie and his
orchestra and Stan Rubin and the
Tigertown Five Friday night.

The voice of Nina Simone caught
the ear of the listening public dur-
ing the summer of 1959, and since
that time she has had meteoric
rise. On records, her albums, “The
Amazing Simone” and “Little Girl
Blue,” became national best sellers
and her singles “I Love You Porgy”
and “Children Go Where I Send
You,” remain high on the charts.

Miss Simone was born in a small
North Carolina town and her only
early musical experience was sing-
ing and playing the organ in the lo-
cal church. A few years later she
began taking classical music lessons
which led to her studying a year at
the Juilliard School of Music in New
York. Here she studied piano and
theory with Carl Friedberg.

Although Nina Simone’s
background was primarily in the
classical field, she began taking a
greater interest in jazz and develop-
ed a flair for improvising. This, plus
the fact that her musie studio busi-
ness was poor during the summer,
led to a booking in an Atlantic City
night club. In this job she gained
the reputation as a fine jazz pianist
and a popular singer. At the end of
the summer she decided to give up

a

musical

her music studio and devote full
time to trying to carve out a career
in show business.

For the next two years she work-
ed in small clubs and appeared on
television shows in and around Phil-
adelphia. From the time she made
her first record, Nina’s career has
moved at a dizzying pace. Her rec-
ords have hit the best-selling lists,
bookings poured in and the enter-
tainment world hailed her as the
musical find of the year.

Nina Simone has performed at the
Round Table, the Village Gate, the
Village Vanguard, Town Hall, Car-

Faculty Resolution On Exams

The action taken by the faculty on the proposed changes in
examination schedules is most encouraging. While the reso-
lution passed has no concrete meaning, it does show that there
is interest in and concern over the matter.

The resolution, as passed by the faculty, merely requests
that professors “try to avoid the scheduling of hour quizzes
in the last week of classes in this semester.” In itself, this does
not say much. The same old problem exists. That is, a student
can still be caught in a bind if his examination schedule hap-
pens to fall the wrong way.

While many of the original proposals were not granted,
the fact that the matter was referred to the Committee on
Courses and Degrees for further study is heartening. We hope
that this will result in some workable and acceptable program
in the near future.

It is our hope that this matter will not be lost in some
remote pigeonhole. The problem has been aired and solu-
tions have been offered. We hope that a permanent solution
can be made before the final examinations in the spring.

The Cut System Petition

The recently circulated petition by John Kirkley shows
that there is great student interest in some form of change in
our present cut system. So far, almost 80 per cent of the stu-
dent body has signed the petition that supports a liberalization
of the existing regulations.

In addition, the Executive Committee received the petition
and gave their unanimous support to the idea of a more liberal
cut system. A committee is now preparing to present this pe-
tition to the faculty.

While the chances of having unlimited cuts for everyone
with a one point average are remote, almost any change in
the present system would be welcome. As the system now exists,
severe academic penalties are given for unexcused absences.
This seems unfair when a student is forced to drop a course with
a failing grade because of an unexcused absence.

It may be argued that the student body is unable to accept
the responsibility of a more liberal cut system. In some cases
this may be true, but some attempt should be made to explore
the possibilities of such a system. If this would still be too
liberal, something should be done to look into the problems
of the severe penalties given for over-cutting. Here, a social
penalty rather than an academic penalty could possibly be
exacted,

It is most evident that the student body is concerned with
the evils of the existing system and that some change should

be made. We hope that this will be done.

A Holiday Message

Holidays are almost upon us again, and most of us will
spend some portion of our time driving from place to place,
party to party, etc. With this in mind, we offer the following
reminder:

ols
W

IN THE NAME OF MODERN ART

We are seriously considering painting one of those highly
modernistic pictures, using new and way-out techniques. The
idea we consider sane, and we've already got a title: Painting
On Asphalt.

We can see it now—the blended shades from the modern
pastels automobile manufacturers are putting on their cars
now. In fact, salmon pink and perhaps turquoise blue would
be nice, to symbolize both sexes. Throw in white trim on one,
black somewhere, and we have universality of races.

We’ll mass the colors into two convergent blobs, balled up
as though someone had taken two hunks of colored clay and
smashed them together at a high velocity. We'll put them on
a black background, and send a stream of light, a sort of beam,
flashing askew from one of them. Somewhere off to one side
we'll have a red light, painted in tones to simulate flashing.

We'll add brilliant crimson blotches around the central
figures, and somewhat below them. Spread it on liberally, we
have plenty of it. And throw in some little sparkles of light, like
lights flashing on glass which has been shattered and spread on
a hard surface. And we'll throw in some smaller, cylindrical
objects, painted in many hues and labeled neatly with weird
names like ‘Black Label,’’ ‘‘Pabst,”’ ‘Budweiser,’ etc. Those
should provide a colorful touch.

On second thought, why bother to go to the trouble of
painting this picture at all? It would just be extra work. We'd
merely be copying a common scene which could and does ap-
pear quite often on our highways.

Symposia . . .

 

By BILL KINSEY

Grading, it has been agreed by
many prominent educators, destroys
_ the use of testing.
Testing in itself is
a fine method of
teaching provided
that the tests are
corrected but not
F graded. The whole
mechanism of
grades tends to
substitute false
goals as the aim of
= studies, i.e., Dean’s
er List, unlimited
esta cuts, Honor Roll,
etc. Essentially, tests should be used
by the professors to find out what

they are failing to get across.
Why then are grades necessary?
The explanation will be that they
are needed to determine progress,
admissions to graduate school, schol-
arships, advice to employers, and

 

 

the like. But there are schools that

have modified grading systems and

some schools which do not grade
at all. Reed College, for example,
does grade, but the grades are never
published to the students. Sarah
Lawrence, on the other hand, does
not grade at all; but they manage
to do quite well on the basis of
recommendations. However, there
is one quite strong implication which
arises in this case and in others
like it. In order for this system to
be successful, it would be necessary
for the faculty to know the students
personally, discuss them, and even
argue about them. Is this beyond
our faculty? Does the present sys-

tem deter and even in some cases

prohibit a close professor-student
relationship?

By KEN LANE |
Assistant Managing Editor

For the reader who is fed up with’
the unexciting particulars of every-
day reality, we suggest a space-
launch into the more stimulating
cosmosphere of what is commonly
called “philosophy.” Here, from our
orbiting satellite, we can view our
beloved Mother Earth in peace,
without fear of hurting anyone’s
feelings.

(For those of you who are dis-
concerted, this introduction is merely
a twentieth-century mode of invok-
ing the Muse, establishing the atmos-
phere, or what have you.)

Still with us, are you? Naturally
when you're up this high the fitting
thing to do, regardless of your nor-
mal mental habits, is to philoso-
phize. For at this height, the world
is too small to deal with anything
but overall generalities.

If you are like most people, you
have begun with the easiest sub-
ject of all—the well-known homo
sapiens. In actuality, you couldn't
have picked a duller topic! But
since you conveniently brought
the subject up, and it’s a subject
few can avoid, we have a few
philosophical remarks we'd like to
include.

We say it’s a dull topic. Without
insulting the human race too much,
we should like to explain our-
selves. We live, you know, in the era
of the “common man”; our society
is that of the “organization man,”
a homogeneous society, its members
easily adjusting to the whole.

What is missing in all this, we
confess, is the individual, once the
basic unit of our dear society. Philo-
sophically peering down from our
satellite, we see night descending
on the age of heroes, the Alexanders
and Caesars. Where today are the
Abraham Lincolns, the Winston
Churchills, the Joseph Stalins, the
Albert Einsteins which were present
in past years?

If we want to be further dis-
couraged about this, we shall per-
mit one of those professional phil-
osophers aboard our craft and
hear what Arthur Schlesinger has
to say. “Our contemporary socie-
ty,” he recently commented in
Perspective magazine, “has little
use for the individual. Individual-
ism implies dissent from the group;
dissent implies conflict; and con-
fiict suddenly seems divisive, un-
American, and generally unbear-
able.”

With splendid success, Americans
are launching a “conspiracy against
creativity,” as Schlesinger describes
it. “For our national apotheosis of
the group means that we systematic-
ally lop off the eccentries, the origi-
nals, the proud, imaginative, lonely
people from whom new ideas come.”

Today we live in the world of
“togetherness,” do we not? All we
ask for is peace of mind. Conflict and
disharmony simply don’t fit into our
scheme of doing things. We ask:
Are there any individuals today who
sharply affect our lives or our way
of thinking? Are there any out-
standing figures today who are shap-
ing our destiny or channeling the
course of history, or is it the “gov-
ernment,” the “science laboratory,”
the “church”?

If we have lost our rugged indi-

 

 

vidualism, our independence of

The Loss Of Individualism
Viewed As Serious Threat

mind, then we must philosophic-
ally conclude that our cherished
principles of democracy and free
society are without foundation.
For once the individual succumbs
to the popular stereotype, he no
longer utilizes freedom of choice.
He acts not by his own decisions,
but by the decisions made for him
by the thing called society.

And so to sum up our discourse,
we once again turn to Mr. Schlesing-
er: “If we are to survive, we must
have ideas, vision, courage. These

(Continued on page 4)

 

European models such as the Uni-
versity of Bologna or the school of
liberal arts in Paris. These European
models all had one thing in com-
mon: in these communities of schol-
ars, teaching and learning could only
be a personal relationship. The stu-
dent worked closely with his masters
in every phase of study. And it was
the principal master himself who
conferred the honor on the student
which signified the act of Com-
mencement. This honor came only
after the student had given a con-
vincing demonstration of his ability
to perform an adult job of work.
How do we go about creating an at-
mosphere that will foster such per-
sonal relationships?

Obviously, the first step is to
restrict the size of the institution.
Experts in the field have made
suggestions as to the size of the
ideal college ranging anywhere
from 300 students on up. Many of
the older liberal arts colleges
which started out with student
bodies somewhere in this small
range have grown considerably
larger. Amherst and Swarthmore
are good points in_ illustration.
Something of an arbitrary limit
has grown up, however, and this
seems to hover about the 1200
mark. So, in this department we
are in good shape. We have the
basic structure in which to work.

The small size of the college has
often been cited as a means of es-
caping the impersonal mass approach
to education. Here, at Washington
and Lee, we have an innovation
that has the potential to make edu-
cational a personal experience I
speak now of the Honors Program.
The Program is designed “to en-
courage independent work, scholarly
investigation and intellectual curio-

 

Recommendations, Not Grades
Should Indicate Student’s Work

sity among students.” And, proper-
ly applied, I am sure that this pro-
gram would do just what it pur-
ports to do,

Too Late

The problem is that it comes too
late in the school career to do the
maximum good. The Program may
only be used by seniors. Does this
imply that sophomores and juniors,
and even freshmen, are incapable of
independent work, scholarly inves-
tigation, and intellectural curiosity,
that these are the perrogatives of
seniors only? Or does it mean
merely that underclassmen must
postpone such until their senior
year? Certainly it is the latter.

I suggest such a program for the
under classes. When the student’s
mind is still open to a number of
fields, this is the time that inde-
pendent work and _ investigation
serve the greatest purpose. Re-
search should be continuous
throughout the four years of the
undergraduate education.

True, the existing Honors Pro-
gram for seniors allows the student
to delve deeply into one particular
field or one segment of a field, an
appropriate way to cap four years of
college; but there is no program that
allows research and comprehensive
examination of several fields, related
or unrelated as they may be, in the
other classes. Such a program is de-
sirable. It would serve to set up a
close student-professor relationship
as early as the first semester of the
freshman year and enable this re-
lationship to continue for four years.
The student and the faculty mem-
bers with whom he would be work-
ing closely would get to know one
another much better than is present-
ly possible.

Cruelties Of Our Cut System:
The Tragedy Of Tom Jones

By JIM LEDBETTER
News Editor

Tom Jones came to Washington
and Lee armed with a suit, a cata-
logue, and a desire to please. He
wore his suit every day and read
his catalogue every night. There
were many things in this little vol-
ume that pleased him, even if he
didn’t understand them; and there
were a few things that didn’t please
him. He never worried about these
things, though, for he realized that
he was merely a freshman and had
to be guided down the way of life.

One of the things that pleased
Tom was the section titled “Ab-
sense Regulations.” “After all,” he
said, “what did I come to school
for?” He looked in the mirror and
a little voice answered him: “ To
go to class.”

So Tom went to class. He had to,
for he only had one cut per class
and he was saving them to go home
one weekend. Some of his classes he
liked and in some he went to sleep.
He felt very badly about going to
sleep in class but there was noth-
ing he could do about it, for some
of his professors were the type
that are reputed to be on 24-hour
call for research by sleeping-pill
manufacturers. One of them re-
peated the textbook vebatim; an-
other spoke in a monotone that even
put the flies to sleep. However, Tom
had the satisfaction of knowing that
at least he went to class.

At the end of the first semester
Tom was rewarded for his hard work
with a 1.896 average. Consulting his
dog-eared catalogue, he found that
he was entitled to a week of cuts
in each class. He found this inter-
esting, though of course he had no
desire to miss class.

One morning, however, Tom
woke up sick. He had an 8:25 class
that morning but he was feeling
so bad that he couldn't even go to
the infirmary. He turned over and
slept through his classes. Some-
where in the depths of the incom-
prehensible workings of his benev-
olent institution, someone chuckled
and a little mark went down.
When he woke up in the afternoon
he was feeling better but when
he went to the infirmary his plea
for an excuse was turned down.
“You have to come here before
your classes,” they informed him,
“and anyway you look all right to

”

us.

 

But Tom remembered that he had
cuts, so everything was fine. He
wondered what would have hap-
pened to him if he had been sick
the first semester; but this didn’t
worry him too much, because it
hadn't happened.

A month later, Tom was faced with
two hour quizzes and a paper on
one day. He kept up with his work
all along, but being a conscientious
student he wanted to do his best on
them. He decided to cut one of his
classes and study. As it turned out,
the professor had merely taken role
and dismissed the class so he could
finish a paper entitled “Means and
Ways to Stop the Alarming Rise of
No-Doze Tablets.”

The next day, Tom’s great-grand-
father died. He was in such a hurry
to get to the funeral that he forgot

 

to clear his absence through the
proper channels. However, since he
still had some cuts left, he was not
worried. He came back three days
later and found that his relation-
ship with the University had been
severed.

Tom went and talked to people,
but they wouldn't listen to him.
For days he beat on the doors
behind which things happen, but
to no avail. He was too ashamed to
face his parents, so he stayed in
his room until they kicked him
out.

But of course this was many years
ago. Tom grew a beard, and faded
quietly into the town where he can
still be seen now and then, his suit
wrinkled and full of holes, standing
in an old doorway and watching
people pass by.

Loyola And American Defeat Tankmen;
Bokinsky And Wolfe Top Team Scoring

By NICK MONSARRAT
The Washington and Lee swim-
ming team didn’t get any favors this
week as they dropped two away—
meets against American University
and Loyola College by decisive mar-

gins, bringing their season record
to 1-3.
Against Loyola of Baltimore it

was power and depth that crushed
the Generals as W&L was held to
only two victories and a host of
third places for an unexpected de-
feat, 67-28.

A poor start in the backstroke
portion of the 400-yard medley re-
lay squelehed that event for the
Generals against American Univer-
sity, and marked the first of a series
of close races which left W&L on
the short end of a 51-44 score.

In the near freezing waters only
freshman Don Casto and the final
relay were able to break the Loy-
ola monoply on first places. Casto
bettered the field of four in the
50-yard freestyle in 24.1, while
the 400-yard freestyle team of
Jahneke, Hart, Monsarrat, and
Casto won in 3:52.0.

The usually victorious John Wolfe
was forced to take a back seat to
the Loyola distance men in both the
200 and 500-yard freestyle events as
both men were clocked under 2:04
for the 200 and 6:00 for the longer
race,

Freshman Bo Bokinsky managed
second places in both the 200-yard
individual medley and the 200-yard
breaststroke events to show promise
of better things to come.

The tepid waters of the Amer-

 

ican University pool provided relief
from the cold of Loyola but none
from the sting of defeat. Bokinsky
and classmate John Lifter gave the
Generals the first two places in the
200-yard breaststroke and Wolfe
took first in the distance events, but
the remainder of the day saw W&L
only lose close races.

Walt McManus led for nine laps
in the 200-yard butterfly only to
lose by inches. John Lifter pre-
ceded this performance with one
of his own in the 200-yard
individual medley with a similar
result. In the 100-yard freestyle
Durham saw two tenths of a sec-
ond place position.

The final relay of Durham, Chase,
Jahneke, and Grant closed out the
meet with a win in 3:50.0.

After a total of four meets Fresh-
man Bo Bokinsky leads the Generals
in scoring with thirty points while

Tom Stover Named Sports Star;
Wins Three Consecutive Matches

This week Washington and Lee’s 4, and against Pfeiffer he won 7-1.

Coach Miller calls Stover a fine
all-around wrestler, which is ob-
vious through his statistics for the
season.” Tom has six takedowns,
two escapes, three reversals, and
five near-pins.

Stover’s record last season in-
cluded seven wins against one loss.
His overall record as a W&L wrest-
ler is an impressive 10-1.

Miller praises Tom for his handi-

wrestle boys much bigger than him-
self. Stover normally weighs about
150, and many of his opponents are
normally 175 pounders who sweat

DECK THE HALLS

When you think of Christmas gifts you naturally think of
Marlboro cigarettes, leading seller in flip-top box in all fifty
states—and if we annex Wales, in all fifty-one—and if we an-
nex Lapland—in all fifty-two. This talk about annexing Wales
and Lapland is, incidentally, not just idle speculation. Great
Britain wants to trade Wales to the United States for a desert.
Great Britain needs « desert desperately on account of the
tourist trade. Tourists are always coming up to the Prime
Minister or the Lord Privy Seal or like that and saying, “I’m
not knocking your country, It’s very quaint and
picturesque, ete. what with Buckingham Palace and Bovril
and Seotland Yard, ete., but where’s your desert?” (Before I
forget, let me point out that Scotland Yard, Britain’s plain-
clothes police branch, was named after Wally Scotland and
Fred Yard who invented plain clothes. The American. plain-
clothes force is called the FBI after Frank B. Incheliff, who
invented fingerprints. Before Mr. Incheliff’s invention, every-
body’s fingers were absolutely glassy smooth. This, as you
may imagine, played hob with the identification of newborn
babies in hospitals. From 1791 until 1904 no American parent

mind you.

Ta ore

ever brought home the right baby from the hospital. This
later became known as the Black Tom Explosion.)

But I digress. England, I was saying, wants to trade Wales
for a desert. Sweden wants to trade Lapland for Frank B. Inch-
cliff. The reason is that Swedes to this day still don’t have
fingerprints. As a result, identification of babies in Swedish
hospitals is so haphazard that Swedes flatly refuse to bring their
babies home. There are, at present, nearly a half-billion un-
claimed babies in Swedish hospitals—some of them well over
eighty years old.

But I digress. We were speaking of Christmas gifts which
naturally put us in mind of Marlboro cigarettes. What could
be more welcome at Christmas time than Marlboro’s flavor,
Marlboro’s soft pack, Marlboro’s flip-top box? What indeed
would be more welcome at any time of year—winter or sum-
mer, rain or shine, night or day? Any time, any season, when
you light a Marlboro you can always be certain that you will
get the same mild, flavorful, completely comfortable smoke.

There are, of course, other things you can give for Christmas
besides Marlboro cigarettes. If, for example, you are looking
for something to give a music lover, let me call to your atten-
tion a revolutionary new development in phonographs—the
Low-fi phonograph. The Low-fi, product of years of patient
research, has so little fidelity to the reeord you put on it that if,
for instance, you put “Stardust” on the turntable, ‘Melancholy
Baby” will come out. This is an especially welcome gift for
people who have grown tired of “Stardust”

Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.

© 1962 Max Shulman

The makers of Marlboro cigarettes, who take pleasure in
bringing you this column througheut the school year, wish
to join old Max in extending greetings of the Season.

The beneficial results of such a

actually know him. And, further-
more, it would relieve the student
of all the loolish pressures now put
upon him by an inflexible grading
system, the grades being replaced
by recommendations based on re-
search and personal conferences and
the individual student’s outlook. The
professor’s role of impersonal arbi-
ter would be replaced by one of a
counseling friend.

To be sure, such a system here
proposed is based on ideals; but I
feel that it could be made workable
in a significant sense. The final step,
of course, would be the attractive
one of working out a friendly ar-
rangement whereby graduate and
professional schools, competing for
good students, would accept these
students on the basis of their merits
as set forth in the recommendations
of their teachers, rather than on
the artificial standard of grades.
