Springs For 1963 Features
‘Holiday In Havana’;
Isley Brothers To Perform

The theme for Springs Weekend is ‘Holiday in Havana,”
Frank Young, President of the Dance Board, announced last

night.

The theme, Young said, will be similar to last year’s Carib-

bean setting.

The Dance Board further announced the signing | of the

Isley Brothers for Saturday night of* ———-—

springs. The trio will appear in the
same concert with Bo Diddley.

The Isley brothers came to New
York early in 1958 to get their start,
and a year later they had been
signed up by one of the most im-
portant agencies in the business—
General Artists Corporation. It
wasn't long after that RCA took
them on where they produced “Turn
to Me” and “I’m Gonna Knock on
Your Door.” They were recognized
as top competitors in the field of
rock and roll and as evidence they
produced “Shout.”

Their success story began long
before they began school. They had
started singing in church activities
and entered small-town contests.
They eventually earned enough
money to make the move to New
York. Their first year there was
their only hard one, but they finally

got their chance with General
Artists.
Last year’s Springs initiated a

move toward fewer dances and more
concerts and no dance on Spring’s
Weekend.

Friday night's concert will be high-
lighted by the appearance of Odetta
and the Journeymen,

Odetta is hailed as one of the
truly great contemporary artists not
only in the folk-singing field but
also in the blues field. She has
played night clubs from “The Hun-
gry i” in San Francisco to the “Blue
Angel” in New York City. She pres-
ently records for RCA, and has
several albums.

Odetta will be followed by the
Journeymen, whose single, “Kum-
bahya” was on the top ten lists
for several weeks. They are equally
adept at pop ballards, blues and
modern jazz, although they are best
known for their folk music.

The group consists of John Phil-
lips, Richard Weismann, and Scott
McKenzie. Phillips, the acknow-
ledged leader of the group, was an
all state basketball and track star
at UVa. and then at George Wash-
ington University. The Journeymen
were discovered by Frank Weber,
the manager of the ever-popular
Kingston Trio. The concert will be
held from 8-10 Friday evening.

According to Mike Jenkins, Vice
President in charge of decorations,
the gym will be decorated with palm
trees and tropical scenes going along
with the theme of “Holiday in Ha-
vanna.” Jenkins added that he will
try to catch the beauty and splen-
dor of the tropical isle in decorations,
the beauty that makes it a “perfect
place to spend a holiday.”

 

The figure will also be presented
on Friday night, introducing the
President of Springs, Ed Croft, and
his vice presidents. According to
Croft, the figure is going to be a
departure from the traditional fig-
ures, but he declined to say speci-
fically what it is to consist of.

Saturday night’s concert is direct-
ed toward the fans of Rock 'n Roll,
with the appearance of Bo Diddley
and the Isley Brothers. Both will
be playing in fraternity houses after
the concert is over.

Bo Diddley was brought to fame
largely on the strength of his 1955
hit entitled “Bo Diddley,” which is,
played today by many
throughout the country. A string of
hit singles and albums has kept Bo
Diddley and his group near the top
of the ladder in the entertainment
business.

KA’s | Cancil
Cocktail Party

For Memorial

Art Broadus, president of KA,
announced last night that KA has
decided to cancel the cocktail party
which was to be held Friday after-
noon of Spring’s Dances in honor
of Ed Croft, President of this year’s
dance set. Instead of holding the tra-
ditional cocktail party, the funds
will be used to institute a memorial
fund in the name of Ted Thompson,
Jr., KA sophomore, who drowned
in a swimming accident on March 13.
He also stated that contributions
from members of the student body
to the memorial fund will be wel-
comed.

Broadus added, “Speaking on be-
half of the house as a whole, we
would like to thank all those who
have helped us in the past two
weeks. We owe a great debt to the
faculty, students, and rescue units
from Lexington and_ surrounding
communities.”

Graveside services for the 19-year-
old pre-med student are being held
this week at Ferncliff Cemetery in
Pelham, New York, with only mem-
bers of the immediate family present.
Memorial services were held last
Tuesday with several members of
KA attending.

Thompson’s body was recovered
Saturday morning on a mid-stream
island which had been covered by

must invent a new,
unprecedented “social mechanism”
that will compel broadcasters to
serve the intelligent public interest
as a part of the nation’s “pluralistic
system of education,” a noted au-
thority on the mass media said in
Washington Monday night.

Gilbert Seldes, dean of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania’s Annen-
berg School of Communications and
a noted television critic, said the
creation of such mechanism is work
for trained minds. But he added that
the device would be effective only
if it involved the general public
in “an intelligent use of their pow-
er.”

addressed the 21st annual
awards dinner of the Alfred I.
duPont Awards Foundation which
recognizes radio and television sta-
tions and commentators for superior
broadcasting in the public interest.

Honored as duPont winners for
1962 at the dinner were stations
WFMT (FM) of Chicago and KVOA-
TV of Tucson, Arizona, and com-
mentator Howard K. Smith of the
American Broadeasting Company.
Only three duPont awards are given
annually, to a relatively large sta-
tion, a relatively small station, and
a commentator.

 

President Fred C. Cole of Wash-
ington and Lee University, chairman
of the duPont Foundation’s awards
committee, made the presentation
of engrossed plaques and $1,000
checks to winners at a dinner held
at Washington’s Mayflower Hotel.
Leaders of the broadcasting indus-
try and related government agencies
joined the duPont committee in
honoring the 1962 winners at the
awards event.

Accepting the duPont Awards for
1962 tonight were Barnard Jacogs,
president of Gale Broadcasting Co.,
Ine., owner of WFMT; Gordon FE,
Hamilton, station manager of KVOA-

TV; and Mr. Smith.
The Alfred I. duPont Awards
Foundation in the field of Radio,

television, and the allied sciences,
was created in 1942 by Mrs. Jessie
Ball duPont in memory of her hus-
band, the late Alfred I. duPont, a
noted scientist and industrialist. The
foundation’s annual awards seek to
recognize “outstanding and meritor-
ious service in encouraging, foster-
ing, promoting, and developing
American ideals of freedom, and for
loyal and devoted service to the na-
tion and to the communities served
by these stations and commentators.”

The 1963-64 edition of the Univer-
sity Catalogue is undergoing several
important revisions, Frank Parsons,
Director of Information announced
today.

The purpose of the changes, Par-
sons stated, is to make the Catalogue
more effective in its two services as
both an introduction to the Univer-
sity for prospective freshmen and
as a handbook to currently enrolled
students.

The Catalogue will be divided into
seven major sections. One of the
principal innovations is represented
by the first section, entitled Infor-
mation for Prospective Freshmen.
This section is divided into the fol-
lowing topics: “Some Purposes of a
Good College,” “The Growth of Two
Centuries,” “The University Today,”
“The Academic Program,” and “Stu-
dent Life.”

The remaining sections are as fil-
lows: Rules and Regulations, The
College, The School of Commerce
and Administration, Courses of In-
struetion, The School of Law, and
General Information and Matters of
Record.

The overall design of the Catalogue
will also be revised, Parsons stated.
The book will be larger in width,
length and thickness. A_ pictorial
cover will replace the solid blue
design. On the front will appear a
duotone picture of the university's
colonnade and an aerial view of the
campus will be represented on the
back.

The printing will be changed from
letterpress to offset, which will pro-

W&L Sinai Groups
To Travel Over Vacation

By HEAD NEWMAN
For Spring Vacation the general
trend is to the South. This trend in-
cludes 3 groups of Washington and
Lee students who are going to
make their vacation worth while.
These groups are the Sabers, the

Sazeracs and the Waysiders.

The Sazeracs will journey to Palm
Beach, Florida. There they will be
singing at the Taboo Club on Worth
Avenue in Palm Beach. The group
will be staying at the Biltmore and
have hopes of entertaining there,
also. The Sazeracs have been aided
in Palm Beach by a W&L alumni,
Bev Smith. As an added note of
interest, the Sazeracs have mentioned
making a record, but it is only a
vision right now and there are no
definte plans whatsover.

The Sabers are going to play at
Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Satur-
day night, and from there they will
journey to Sea Island, Georgia. They
have an engagement Monday night
at the Beach House, at the Cloister
Hotel.

The Waysiders, a folk singing
group that has performed several
times in the Lexington area plans
to go North for the vacation and has
an engagement at the Flambeau in
Baltimore. The group is made up of
Jim Ledbetter, Dave Trussell, with
an occasional appearance by Sam
| Simpson .

vide for more photographs and “e
more attractice appearance,” Par-
sons remarked.

The pictures will be more numer-
ous and will be in black and white.

“The major feature of the new
Catalogue,” Parsons explained, “is
the separation of the rules and regu-
lations from the description of the
university.” The separation was made
for the convenience of incoming
freshmen.

Parsons added that the new Cata-
logue was just one step of a multi-
stage plan which the Administra-
tion is initiating. The ultimate ob-
jective, Parsons intimated, is the
separation of the Catalogue into
two books, one for prospective fresh-
men and one for students of the
university.

Parsons stated that the new Cata-
logue should be available late in
April.

 

N FU Replaced
By New Group

The University’s Non-Fraternity
Union has been supplanted by a new
organization, Bill Lowry, senior, an-
nounced today.

The new organization is called the
Independent Union. It is the product
of a caucus meeting of non-frater-
nity students who assembled in
February of this year. A Steering
Committee was elected to organize
the details of the union and plan a
general program.

The members of the Steering Com-
mittee are Bill Lowry, senior, Rod
Cockshutt and Matt Hulbert, juniors;
Shannon Jung and Andy Stone,

sophomores; Gene Hatfield and Lew | —

Davis, freshmen.

“The primary function of the
Union” stated Cockshutt, “is to or-
ientate student activity more toward
the student body as a whole and
less on fraternities.”

The Union, Cockshutt added, will
not be exclusively non-fraternity.

At present, the organization has
a membership of some fifty students.

It resolved at a meeting held
earlier this month tht it would adopt
a non-alignment policy far as
politics were concerned. As soon as
the University and
Parties announce their candidates,
the Union will pledge its support to
one of the slates.

The Independent Union also in-
tends to field teams in all intra-
mural sports as part of | its program.

ReVue Films Tonight

ReVue films will be shown tonight
at 7 p.m. They are two shorts in col-
or—“Dong Kingman,” the James

many other books on Greece and
on Greek Drama. Most recently he
has translated the tragedies of Soph-
ocles into English verse.

Known for his wit and his apt
turn of phrase, Kitto names as his
recreations “music and Greek.” He
remarks that his private activities
“are of no particular interest ex-
cept to his wife, two children, a
few other well-chosen relatives and
friends, and to the anxious conduc-
tor of the Bristol University orches-
tra.”

The convocation on April 12, at
noon in duPont Auditorium, open
to the public, not only honors the
new initiates into Phi Beta Kappa,
but also commemorates the generos-
ity of the Society of the Cincinnati

Because of its esteem for George
Washington, the Cincinnati group
gave a generous endowment fund to
the institution that had recently
changed its name to Washington
College, after the First President
made a gift to it. Washington’s gift
to the university, made in 1796, was
in the form of 100 shares of valuable
canal stock.

There will be an initiation for
new members of Phi Beta Kappa on

tion. Mr. Kitto will be present at

The Freshman Elective

An action of the Faculty Committee on Courses and De-
grees has made it possible for the W&L freshman in future
years to elect one sophomore course. This course may come
from the field of sociology, political science, philosophy, re-
ligion, psychology, and some others. The only stipulation is
that the chosen course have no prerequisites. Any freshman
may do this regardless of his placement scores.

The object of this move is not, as some have thought, to
move a freshman along more quickly. Indeed, whatever fresh-
man course an incoming student may waive in preference for
for an elective must be made up in his sophomore year. If a
freshman elected to take sophomore philosophy in his freshman
year instead of math, for example, he would have to take the

math in his sophomore year.

The purpose of the plan, rather, is to give the freshman an
opportunity to investigate a field in which he is particularly in-
terested without having to wait until his sophomore year. Also,

it will alleviate the tedium which

elementary courses. The W&L Freshman year has been in
the past, as rigid a schedule as one could imagine. The variety
which this plan offers to the freshman, while not revolutionary,
is certainly a step toward a more stimulating freshman course of

study.

It should also be pointed out that the elective program is
separate from the placement program, which provides a means
for talented freshmen to skip History 1 and 2, and English 1,
depending on placement scores.
an intelligent freshman to move into sophomore history and
math, into whatever language level his placement scores allow,
and into English 2, and in addition take a sophomore elective

course.

Year's Ten Best Movies
Include Lolita, The Night

By TOM PACE

With little ado I will select those
films which I believe were the finest
of the year.

In evaluating them I paid no at-
tention to the importance of the
content or message in the film.
Rather, I tried to decide what the
director’s intentions were, to consid-
er the treatment which he gave
them, and to ascertain how well he
succeeded. The directors’ names are
in parentheses.

The Night

1. The Night (Michelangelo Anto-
nioni)—The only film which I
thought was a complete success, it is
concerned with the incommunicabil-
ity of man. Antonioni’s subtle, slow,
precise style is a marvel by itself,

 

and was particularly effective in this

film. The movie starred three of
icaEurope’s best: Jeanne Moreau,
Monica Vitti and Marcello Mastro-
ianni.

2. Lolita—(Stanley Kubrick)—
Krubrick seems to me the finest
American director. This film posses-
ses an aura of sophistication which
I found unparalleled in my viewing.
It was easily the funniest film that
I have ever seen. Unfortunately this
was its only weakness. It was too
comic to deal with its subject suc-
cessfully. James Mason’s perform-
ances was the finest of the year, and
Nelson Riddle’s music was little
short of ingenious.

faut)—Truffaut may be the best di-

By BILL LOWRY
and ROD COCKSHUTT

With the ever-increasing demand
for a first-class higher education,
and with more and more qualified
applicants thinking about Washing-
ton and Lee each year, no one can
deny that it is extremely important
to keep on our toes, as far as the
academic side of campus life is con-
cerned. Washington and Lee has
been, and is, for the most part, doing
its best to meet these demands, as
is seen by some of the revisions tak-
ing place in the curriculum next
year. At the same time, it is import-
ant that we always consider new
ideas in order to insure the same
high quality undergraduate educa-
tion for which we have been known,
and, if at all possible, to improve it
as much as possible. The following
proposals are presented, therefore,
not so much with the idea of critic-
izing existing policies, but in the
spirit of enriching the academic and
intellectual side of Washington and
Lee life.

Revamping Freshman Program

The logical place to begin any dis-
cussion of our academic emphasis
is the incoming freshman, as it is
these students who are demanding
more and more in the way of a col-
lege education; this brings us at
W&L to the subject of Freshman
Camp. If space and time permit-
ted, much could, of course, be
found to criticize the way this
program has been in the past; suffice
it to say now, however, that the
emphasis at Freshman Camp has not
exactly been in the direction of ori-
enting new students to the academic
discipline which should be demand-
ed by Washington and Lee.

Freshman Reading List

In looking at the programs of other
colleges and universities we find that
Washington and Lee is one of the
few major Universities which does
not have a summer reading program
for incoming freshmen. Our pro-
posal, therefore, is that a list of ap-
proximately five books, the nature of
which will be discussed below, be
sent to incoming freshmen, with fa-
cilities made available for provid-
ing such books through the Univer-
sity.

Freshmen will be expected to have
read the books before arriving in
Lexington, and the reading would
be used to form the basis for dis-
cussions at Freshman Camp; various
professors, familiar with the fields
covered in the reading could give

 

(Continued on page 4)

 

short lectures, and the Camp Coun-

FRESHMAN READING LIST

 

sellors themselves would be respon-
sible for holding smaller discussions.
Thus, from the very beginning of
a student’s freshman year, the world
of ideas would be an existing reality.
University-Wide List

At the same time, such a program
might not be a bad one to establish
on a University-wide basis. If every
student would read five books in
common with the rest of the Student
Body during summer vacation, a
basis for discussion would be pro-
vided which would link the entire
University Community, regardless of
major or school, unifying them to-
wards a general academic outlook.

Various seminars, lectures and dis-
cussions could then be held periodi-
cally through the academic year,
making use of the various ideas
brought out in the reading. Experts
in the fields under discussion could
then come to campus and speak to
an audience with at least a minimum
acquaintance with the particular
field under discussion; it might even
be possible to get the authors of
some of the books themselves on
campus for a few days to hold sem-
inars and give lectures.

Furthermore, in the classroom, in-
structors could also assume a famil-
iarity with the works, thus being
able to rely upon them for illus-
trations and examples relevant to
their own subject.

Unifying Effect

By far the greatest value of such
a program, however, would be the
unifying effect that it would have
on the University as a whole, bring-
ing together all of the various dis-
ciplines, thus bridging some of the
gaps between the Science School, the
Liberal Arts School and the Com-
merce School, and providing as well
a common intellectual background
for all students, regardless of per-
sonal and social preference. Such a
program has been tried at at least
one University—Franklin and Mar-
shall College—with what appears to
be a good deal of success; we see
no reason why it would not be ef-
fective here as well.

Faculty Committee

The books to be discussed would
be selected by a faculty commit-
tee, and would perhaps consist of
five books, from as many different
fields.

We suggest at least one book of
general educational importance, such
as C. P. Snow’s The Two Cultures
and the Scientific Revolution, or

 

one of the Conant studies of Amer-

ican Education; one book drawn
from the field of the social sciences,
such as The Lonely Crowd, Norman
Brown’s Life Against Death, or
Erich Fromm’s Escape from Free-
dom; one book drawn from contem-
porary British or, preferably, Amer-
ican fiction, such as Rabbit, Run,
Lord of the Flies; Catch 22, or A
Long and Happy Life; one work
numbered among the “great clas-
sies,’ such as Plato’s Republic or
Dante’s Divine Comedy; and one
book drawn from the fields of eco-
nomics and political science, such
as Galbraith’s Affluent Society, or
Michael Harrington’s The Other
American.

Of course, in picking these books,
it would be best to choose those
readily available in paperback, and
the University Supply Store or the
Book Shop on Washington Street
could then order the required num-
ber, so as to make them available
before summer vacation. The admin-
istrative details seem slight indeed,
in comparison with the rich intel-
lectual rewards which could be of-
fered by such programs, both in
terms of incoming freshmen, and in
terms of the Academic Community
as a whole.

Recognize Professors

Our third proposal is not so much
a means of stimulating academic

 

awareness as one of recognizing

Revisions In Curriculum Suggested
To Accent Emphasis On Academics

that which already exists; by rec-
ognizing those outstanding faculty
members who have contributed so
much to make the intellectual life
at Washington and Lee what it is.

We propose, therefore, to have the
student body, at, say, the time of
the general student body elections,
be allowed to vote for the best pro-
fessor in the following categories:
1) most dedicated professors; 2) the
professor most approachable by stu-
dents; 3) the most brilliant lecturer
and classroom personality; 4) the
most scholarly professor; and 5) the
best new professor.

After the final choices have been
determined, the honored professors
would then be awarded a plaque
or scroll, or some other suitable
award, by the student body, work-
ing through the Executive Commit-
tee. Most of our professors are com-
petent, and many are outstanding;
such a recognition of their con-
tributions to Washington and Lee
seems only fair.

Workable Proposals

The above proposals are all work-
able, and would require very simple
machinery to put into reality. We
have done a lot academically on this
campus, but we still have a long
way to go. Such proposals as the
above seem to be in the best inter-

 

Dorm Cones) Applications

ests of all concerned.

To Be Submitted By April 20

Applications are invited for the
position of Freshman Dormitory
Counselors for the 1963-64 academic
year. Dormitory Counselors can be
of great assistance in aiding the
adjustment required of freshmen.
For this reason these positions are
considered to be among the most re-
sponsible entrusted to Washington
and Lee students.

Certain guidelines for the selection
of Dormitory Counselors have been
set up on the basis of past exper-
ience. Applicants must be at least
current sophomores, and should not
have routine commitments after
8:00 p.m. that would normally take
a Counselor from the dormitory for
any appreciable time. While Coun-
selorships are not awarded on an
academic basis, a student who has
failed to maintain a C average would
probably not be selected.

The awards of Counselorship are
not based on financial need. How-

To the Editor,

With reference to the following
passage in the Editorial of last Tues-
day’s Ring-tum Phi:

“..,the tradition of conventional
dress is too valuable to W&L to
be abandoned or even weakened.
And the Assimilation Committee is
doing its job too well to be swept
aside at the behest of young phil-
osophers and outraged individual-
ists, whose philosophy consists of
not cutting their hair, whose indi-
viduality consists of not wearing
socks, and who are far less valu-
able to Washington and Lee than
the tradition they flout.”

We could hardly care less about
cutting hair or not wearing socks,
but we are two “young philosophers”
who certainly are “outraged” with
the sentiments expressed in the edi-
torial quoted above.

The idea that any tradition is more
valuable than the individual dignity
of a human being is both repugnant
and obseene. Traditions exist to
serve us, and we refuse to become
the slaves of any sacred cow, no
matter what majority may support
it, no matter what institution is be-
hind it.

When are we going to wake up?

Sincerely yours,

Alumnus Blasts Commons

Lexington, Va.
Dear Sir:

Congratulations to Don Casto for
his BLAST at the Freshman Com-
mons. Most of the students now on
campus did not experience the W&L
of pre-commons days and I am glad

 

a current freshman can see the dis-
advantages of the Commons.

I am one of many alumni who
complained bitterly about the Com-
mons from the time it was first ru-
mored in 1954, and I am still com-
plaining about it.

The University has justified the

Commons on these questionable
points:
(1) It is desirable to have all
Freshmen eat together for class
unity.

(2) It is needed for non-fraternity
students.

I think it is ridiculous to say that
the Commons is required for class
unity when without the Commons,
freshmen already lived together and
went to classes together for possibly
12 hours per day (excluding sleeping
time.) How can an additional 114-
2 hours per day at meals be import-
ant enough to justify this concen-
tration-camp type existence (wheth-
er the food is good or bad)?

As respects non-fraternity stu-
dents, at one time the University
managed quite well with a smaller
Dining Hall run by the University,
and I see no reason why something
similar for Law Students and NFU’s
could not be used today. Let’s also
keep in mind that the NFU’s are
that by choice. They prefer to stay
out of groups or they would have
pledged a fraternity (in my opinion
any freshman who really wants to
join a fraternity can do so at W&L).
So is it logical to encourage them
to group together for eating pur-
poses? I think it is clear that the
NFU’s, as a group, do not require
or justify the Commons.

IN MY OPINION, THE COM-
MONS WAS BUILT ONLY FOR
ONE REASON—TO INTENTION-
ALLY WEAKEN THE FRATERNI-
TIES. The effect was not immediately
and equally serious for all fraterni-
ties, but over a period of years the
fraternity group WILL be seriously
affected. And, of greater importance,

this is just one of other moves that
can affect fraternities, such as:

(1) Deferred Rushing—this has
been publicized seriously each year
since the Commons appeared. Could
it be that this comes up as a result
of some quiet word dropped by a
member of the Administration or
Faculty?

(2) Should deferred rush _ be
adopted, then several fraternities will
be in financial difficulty. At this
point the University has to take
drastic action and all students are
moved into University dormitories.

(3) Complete abolishment of fra-
ternities may then take place.

There are many colleges with
dorms for all students. But that

doesn’t mean that EVERY college
should be on a 100 per cent dormi-
tory basis. One of the strengths of
higher education in the USA is the
great diversity of institutions. W&L
is different in many respects, one of
which is that fraternities rave fed
and housed most students and have a
great part of the so-called assimila-
tion. This is one of the great bene-
fits of W&L—let’s keep it that way.
Why must we copy Harvard, Am-
herst or Kenyon? W&L students
have traditionally had a_ large
amount of freedom. The fraternity
system has permitted this.

The Commons has not yet “stran-
gled” fraternities, but it has affected
every one. Freshmen Gareth Aden
has stated that “the change was
made smoothly with the fraternities
merely preparing less food than be-
fore.” That is an incorrect state-
ment. I belong to a typical fraternity
at W&L and the Commons required

 

 

 

tions including the elimination of at
least one employee. I estimate that
freshmen constitute roughly 30 per
cent of the total quantity of per-
sons in the typical W&L chapter,
and when you suddenly eliminate
that volume of certain income (and
certain profit), there must be a sig-
nificant adjustment.

Obviously, each fraternity has
been affected differently. No two
houses have identical financial sit-
uations. But the typical fraternity
at W&L is not as well off as 5 years
ago. The unusually large number
of fraternities at W&L makes them
more vulnerable to financial adver-
sities. W&L’s ratio of 18 fraternities
for 1,000 undergraduates is among

 

the highest in the country.

The fraternities have definitely
suffered from this change and will
feel it more each year. In effect,
W&L built the Commons (at a cost
of $75,000) at the expense of the fra-
ternities—financially and psycholog-
ically.

The freshmen, according to Don
Casto, are not being assimilated
properly now. According to what I
have read in the Ring-tum Phi for
the past three years, I believe that
is correct. There have been many
evidences of increasing opposition
to W&L traditions and less satis-
faction by the students generally
with the entire University. In my
opinion, much of this unrest can be
attributed to the elimination of the
fraternity influence on the freshmen.
I, personally, got more out the fra-
ternity my freshman year than any
other year. Each fraternity is not
perfect and can be improved, but

a substantial change in our opera-! there is every reason to expand the

influence of fraternities, not weaken
it.

So, we have this monstrosity,
benefitting no group, weakening the
fraternities, creating problems, ruin-
ing appetites, encouraging ulcers.
This monstrosity cost $750,000.00—
money that should have been used
for educational facilities. The Uni-
versity is constantly besieging the
alumni, parents, friends, founda-
tions, ete. for funds, and the “hill”
has the amazing idea that $750,000
can be spared for this monument
which may eventually be a grave-
stone for all or part of the W&L
fraternity organization.

I might add that neither the Ad-
ministration nor the Board of Trus-
tees sampled alumni opinion on this
revolutionary change. In fact, alum-
ni opinion has not been sampled on
any matter in the past 15 years. How
about that for keeping the public
happy?

Pseudo Knocks Coolism

Cool Stud, C.C.F.,

They are not long, the days of wine
and roses...
And panty raids.

So “our pious pseudo little intel-
lect” is taking over is he? And Lex-
ington is getting quiet and dull, and
you would probably like to see him
take his toys and “mistaken sense of
values” and go play someplace else.
You big, Joe-College, neat fellow,
who mourns for the good ole days
and cries over this new generation
of phonies. I pity you.

In your editorial you allude to this
sort of individual as discussing “God
and sex and solving world prob-
lems in the one night a week he
allots to such frivolity.” First I
would like to compliment your sub-
tle sarcasm. It’s really pretty clever.

 

But what about the “God and sex

 

 

ever, in order to ensure the greatest
possible contact with freshmen,
Counselors are provided with a
single room in the dormitory and
the dinner meal in the Commons,
which they are expected to eat with
freshmen.

The primary basis of selection of
Counselors will be that of general
fitness to aid in making the Fresh-
man Dormitory an adequate envir-
onment for a_ student’s freshman
year.

Applications should be filed in the
Office of the Dean of Students by
Saturday, April 20, 1963, and should
include information that will be
helpful to the Selection Committee.
Further details concerning duties
and responsibilities can be obtained
from Phil Sharp, Head Dormitory
Counselor, and Kemp Morton or

Counselors, all members of the Se-
lection Committee.

and solving the world problems.”
What a strange list. Religion, per-
haps. Sex, no. Solving world prob-
lems, I don’t know. But sex—he
most likely got tired of this subject
long ago. And the “one night a week
he allots to such frivolity.”—Well, if
he does allot one night a week to
worry about this, then you are cor-
rect and he is a pseudo; but maybe
you just happen to see him one
night a week... maybe Saturday
at the College Inn where he is back
in a corner, and you with all the
coolness of your generation perhaps
declare, “Is this a fish I see before
me?”

But on the other hand, maybe a
few of these persons are, to use the
quaint old expression, “for real.”
Maybe he is concerned with the
things he talks about on Saturday
night and perhaps he meditates over
what you refer to as “God and Sex,
ete.” all during the week up in that
no-cool-man’s-land—Baker Dorm.
And who are you to judge “our
pious little pseudo intellect?” Do
you know him? Have you ever talk-
ed with him...by yourself... for
long? And where does this all-see-
ing, perceptive sentitivity abound
that allows you to refer to “his mis-
taken sense of values?” Maybe he
is a person who has a sense of values
and actually tries to live by them.

This would be a rare bird indeed.
Sure, most of the time it is a role,
but what isn’t? Weren’t the guys

fighting the fire department playing
the rather hackneyed, cool-stud
role? Aren’t weejuns and Gant shirts
and rep ties and Brooks Brothers
and wide belts and Sem on Friday
and Hollins on Saturday as big a
role? Not pseudo intellect, but pseu-
do sophisticate.

You neat guys are very dominant

around here. So don’t wolry ...re-
lax...you’re safe. But, big fella,
why don’t you play your part and

let everybody else play his?

Six returning lettermen will be
on hand Tuesday when Washington
and Lee University’s tennis team
opens its 1963 season in Lexington
against powerful Colgate University.

Colgate ripped the General net-
ters, 9-0, on a Southern swing two
years ago, but this year should be
a different story. W&L captain John
Baker, Jim Mell, Jim DeYoung, John
Mills and Lindsey Short make up
a formidable group for the invad-

a junior from Suffolk, is rated as one
of Coach Bill Washburn’s top play-
ers.

Colgate Strong

Colgate and W&L did not meet in
tennis last year.

The Generals, who posted a 5-3
record last year, will play a nine-

Colgate, W&L’s toughest foes should
be George Washington University
and the University of Virginia.

Baseball
Faces Elon

'In Opener

By TOM CARPENTER

Lane, Flanagan, and a little luck
appear to be the keys to a success-
ful season for the baseball team as
they prepare for their season open-
er March 30 at Elon.

The Generals opened their exhi-
bition season here Saturday with a
6-5 defeat at the hands of a rugged
VMI squad. It was a tough defeat

:|as W&L overcame a 4-0 deficit to

tie the game, only to lose it on a

| passed ball and a wild pitch.

Lane, Flanagan Star
The stars of the game were Cap-
tain Chuck Lane and second base-
man Lou Flanagan. Lane played

‘| flawless ball in the field and rapped

two clean singles, but was over-

:| shadowed by the heavy hitting and
‘| heady play of Flanagan.

The hustling junior
and a

pounded a
clutch double

tastic in the field.
For example, on a single to left

Flanagan took the relay throw from

Dick Brown, noticed that the runner

/ had taken too wide a turn, and
:, whipped the ball to Howie Martin
:| for the out.

Flanagan also was the main man

on a play in which the Generals

foiled a double steal, getting the
runner on third and keeping the

| runner on first from advancing.

Allen Sharp
Ashley Allen also looked good in
the game, banging a clutch single to
drive in an important run and play-
ing steadily behind the plate.

The Elon College game is the first
stop on the spring trip that in-
cludes Camp Lejeune, East Carolina
College, and Old Dominion. The
squad should be at full strength
with the exception of centerfielder

wound up third with 20-614. Going
into the last two jumps, Kell held

but each soared far in the finals.

Goode Impressive

Freshman Mike Goode looked good
in the high hurdles, winding up sec-

Mark Owen took third in the 60 in

Old Dominion To Be Big

Test

For Generals’ Track Supremacy

Washington and Lee University’s:
track team—67 men strong for 1963—
is shooting for its third undefeated
season in four years.

Only a 69-62 loss to Wake Forest
College last spring kept the Gen-
erals from scoring a perfect 21-0
dual meet record for 1960, 1961 and
1962.

The biggest obstacle to the Gen-
erals’ bid for another unblemished
record is today’s opponent—Old Do-
minion in Norfolk.

Twenty-five veterans and a host of
freshmen are combining to form
what Coach Norm Lord calls a “team
of real promise.”

Headed by co-captains Dave Mun-
roe in the shot put and Mickey
Walker in the javelin, the Generals
boast the most powerful of all
track weapons—depth—in the 13 of
the 15 events. Only the pole vault
and high jump lack at least three
“good” men.

Junior Robin Kell stands alone
as the best in the high jump and
hop, step and jump. Kell finished
second in both events in last year’s
state meet.

Kell’s brother, Chris, is the Gen-
erals’ top dash man, but he is cur-

 

rently sidelined with a leg injury.
Freshmen Don Casto, Scott Ken-
nedy and Mark Owen and junior
Henry Sackett should take up the
slack created by Kell’s injury.

In the distances, the freshmen ac-
count for some welcomed depth
over last year. Riff O’Connor (two-
mile), Lee Johnson (mile) and Clyde
Foshee (mile) join veterans Mike
Shank, Andy Kilpatrick, Charlie
Head and Bob Patton.

Skip Essex, who finished second
to Virginia’s 440 whiz Gil Faccio
in the state meet last year, is still
the champ of the middle distance
men. Mack Brownlee and Fox
Urquhart along with freshmen Jim
Thompson and senior Wayne Barnes
back up Essex.

The Broad jump is a coach’s para-
dise. Tommy Edwards, Sackett and
Robin Kell are well over 21 feet,
and four others are pushing the 20-
foot barrier.

In the hurdles, junior John Pear-
son is the number one man, but
freshmen Bob Vaughan, Mike Goode,
George Bokinsky, Ken McGraw and
Casto should add much-needed
depth.

HOW TO GET EDUCATED
ALTHOUGH ATTENDING COLLEGE

In your quest for a college degree, are you becoming a narrow
specialist, or are you being educated in the broad, classical
sense of the word?

This question is being asked today by many serious observers
—ineluding my barber, my roofer, and my little dog Spot—
and it would be well to seek an answer.

Are we becoming experts only in the confined area of our
majors, or does our knowledge range far and wide? Do we, for
example, know who fought in the Battle of Jenkins’ Kar, or
Kant’s epistemology, or Planck’s constant, or Valsalva’s maneu-
ver, or what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above Tintern
Abbey?

If we do not, we are turning, alas, into specialists. How
then can we broaden our vistas, lengthen our horizons—be-
come, in short, educated?

Well sir, the first thing we must do is throw away our curri-
cula. Tomorrow, instead of going to the same old classes, let
us try something new. Let us not think of college as a rigid
discipline, but as a kind of vast academic smorgasbord, with
all kinds of tempting intellectual tidbits to savor. Let’s start
sampling tomorrow.

neon Hees’

We will begin the day with a stimulating seminar in Hittite
artifacts. Then we will go over to marine biology and spend a
happy hour with the sea slugs. Then we will open our pores by
drilling a spell with the ROTC. Then we'll go over to journalism
and tear out the front page. Then we'll go to the medical school
and autograph some casts. Then we'll go to home economics
and have lunch.

And between classes we'll smoke Marlboro Cigarettes. This,
let me emphasize, is not an added fillip to the broadening of
our education. This is an essential. To learn to live fully and
well is an important part of education, and Marlboros are an
important part of living fully and well. What a sense of com-
pleteness you will get from Marlboro’s fine tobaccos, from
Marlboro’s pure filter! What flavor Marlboro delivers! Through
that immaculate filter comes flavor in full measure, flavor with-
out stint or compromise, flavor that wrinkled care derides,
flavor holding both its sides. This triumph of the tobacconist’s
art comes to you in soft pack or Flip-Top box and can be lighted
with match, lighter, candle, Welsbach mantle, or by rubbing
two small Indians together.

When we have embarked on this new regimen—or, more
accurately, lack of regimen—we will soon be cultured as all
get out. When strangers accost us on the street and say, ‘‘What
was Wordsworth doing ten miles above Tintern Abbey, hey?”
we will no longer slink away in silent abashment. We will reply
loud and clear:

“As any truly educated person knows, Wordsworth, Shelley,
and Keats used to go to the Widdicombe Fair every year for
the poetry-writing contests and three-legged races, both of
which they enjoyed lyrically. Well sir, imagine their chagrin
when they arrived at the Fair in 1776 and learned that Oliver
Cromwell, uneasy because Guy Fawkes had just invented the
spinning jenny, had cancelled all public gatherings, including
the Widdicombe Fair and Liverpool. Shelley was so upset
that he drowned himself in a butt of malmsey. Keats went to
London and beeame Charlotte Bronte. Wordsworth ran blindly
into the forest until he collapsed in a heap ten miles above
Tintern Abbey. There he lay for several years, sobbing and
kicking his little fat legs. At length, peace returned to him. He
looked around, noted the beauty of the forest, and was so moved
that. he wrote Joyce Kilmer’s immortal Trees... And that,
smart-apple, is what Wordsworth was doing ten miles above
Tintern Abbey.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Pace Selects Ten Best Movies

(Continued from page 2)
rector alive. His film proceeds at an
incredable rate. His film technique
is superb. The only faults I found
in this movie were the irrelevancy
of some scenes, and its inconsistency.
Truffaut allows us to look forward
to much better films.

4. Last Year at Marienbad—(Alain
Resnais)—Very simply, it was the
most visually fascinating film of
this year, or any other. Its incon-
gruity makes you believe that Res-
nais has merely touched on a new
and brilliant concept.

5. Shoot the Piano Player—(Fran-
cois Truffaut)—This was Truffaut's
second film. It, as does Jules and
Jim. shows his genius in the craft
of film making, although it falls short
of being a great movie. Truffaut's use
of music added immeasurably to
the films effect.

6. Lawrence of Arabia (David
Lean)—When you see it, you will
have to admit that at last here is a
spectacular that is spectacular in
every scene. I found it always inter-
esting, and Peter O’Toole’s perform-
ances will add to Lawrence’s legend.

7. The Miracle Worker (Arthur
Penn)—Despite its being too melo-
dramatic, and several poor support-
ing performances, this film packed
the most impressive impact of the
year. Anne Bancroft and Patty Duke
gave two brilliant performances.

8.Long Day's Journey Into Night
(Sidney Lumet)—It began strong,
became a little dull, only to come
on brilliantly the last 45 minutes.
Though it was perhaps too long,
paradoxically its length added to its
strength. There were three very fine
performances, and Lumet’s direction
was well-controlled.

9. David and Lisa (Frank Perry)— |
This was almost an amateur pro-|
duction; it was a first effort film.
Its real rank comes from what Per- |
ry promises to give in the future.

10. Lonely Are the Brave (David)
Miller) and Taste of Honey (Tony '

| Richardson)—Both films were very
good and offered up something that
was interesting. Neither one had
pretense, and both contained some
excellent performances.

There were, of course, other films
which were noteworthy. There were
some that I was sorry to leave off.
Here are a few:

Through a Glass Darkly (Igmar
Bergman), To Kill a Mockingbird
(Robert Mulligan), Billy Budd
(Peter Ustinov), Two for the See-
saw (Robert Wise), Birdman of Al-
catraz (John Frankenheimer, Di-
vorce—lItalian Style (Pietro Germi),
View from the Bridge (Sidney
Lumet), The Notorious Landlady
(Robert Mulligan).

And I am sure there are others. I
forget easily. However, I do remem-
ber The Manchurian Candidate. It
is purposely omitted.

Letters To The Editor

Dear Sir:

During the past several weeks,
many comments on the inefficiency
of the Slater System have appeared
in the pages of the Ring-tum Phi.
However, I feel that there exists
a situation of much graver concern
to all students.

Lying some thirty feet from the
much-discussed Evans Dining Hall
is the University Co-op and “book-
store,” a mercenary institution which
is choking the student. As I see the
manager of this institution drive
home in his brand new Oldsmobile
after a hard six-hour working day,
I feel assured that his is a success-
ful establishment.

The success of the bookstore is
dependent on the law of supply and
demand. Unfortunately, while we,
the students, have the demand, the
bookstore does not have the supply.
Those items which the store does
have are grossly overpriced. Allow

me to cite a few illustrative ex-
amples.
1) Several weeks ago, I purchased

a book which is required reading for
my History course. This book, a
paperback, was originally priced
exorbitantly at $1.25. However,
cleverly pasted over the original
price was another label, making an
even further markup.

2) Because of the great demand
for major novels, the shelves in the
library are kept consistently void
of these works. The student now
must turn to the bookstore, where
he hopes to purchase inexpensively
the book he is seeking. However, he
finds to his dismay that the “bhook-
store” does not have the book unless
=

required reading for some
course.
Books, especially those required

for courses, are obviously a necessity
for the student. It is a financial
strain on many students who are
forced to pay high prices for such
necessities. Some sensible reform,
therefore, is in order.

I propose that the bookstore and
Co-op be modified to correspond
along the lines of similar set-ups
at schools such as Harvard and Yale,

 

or at Southern institutions such as
Emory University. For example, at
the Harvard “Coop,” the Harvard
students are issued a card which
enables them to purchase at a re-
duced rate anything from books to
banners to chairs.

Our own system should be modi-
fied similarly, in order to offer to
th student of Washington and Lee
both a wide variety of selections
and sensible prices, as neither of
these is available to him at the
present.

Pitching Strong

As of now most of the positions
seem set.

The mound duo of Mason McGow-
in and Brice Gamber should hold its
own. Both Gamber and McGowin
have the pitches, but neither has
reached top form yet. The rest of the
staff consists of sidearmer Lou Pa-
terno, and two southpaws, Sammy
Simpson and Chris Wigert. All
three will see considerable action
this season.

The catcher’s spot is up for grabs

FE ° °
or Spring Trip
between Allen and freshman Pete
Hendricks. Hendricks has done well
thus far, but hurt his chances by
missing the VMI game with an
injured left hand. Allen was quite
impressive with his bat against the
Keydets.
Infield Set

The infield will probably be Mrr-
tin at first, Buck Rose at short, and
Lane and Flanagan. Barry Green
and Eric Sisler, a freshman, are also
in the running. There is a possibility
that Sisler will be at second when
the season starts, with Flanagan
moving to first.

The outfield is fairly solvent with
Brown in left, Candler in center, and
Bob Taylor in right. Ricky Kneipper
and Jim Boardman are the main re-
serves. Boardman will probably
handle center in Candler’s absence
on the trip, since Kneipper is out
with poison ivy.

The game with Old Dominion
should be the highlight of the trip.
The Norfolk club has won 13
straight and is still going strong.
A victory over the Monarchs would
make it a successful trip.
