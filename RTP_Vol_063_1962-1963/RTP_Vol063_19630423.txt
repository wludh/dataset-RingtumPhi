Fr. Laval’s Visit |
Called Success

 

By BILL LOWRY
Often, a visitor to our campus
community can give us valuable.

insights, not only into a particular,
subject matter or discipline but!
into our own frame of reference as,
well. Such was certainly the case
regarding Father Jacques Laval,
a French Dominican Priest, who
visited W&L under the auspices of
ReVue.

Father Laval stayed as the guest
of Prof. Jay Taylor of the French
Department, taking his meals at the
ZBT house, in addition to visiting
with students at Sigma Chi, and
various other groups. He also gave
several talks on various subjects,
speaking on the Mass and St. Dom-
inic to Dr. Sprunt’s class on Chris-
tian Doctrine; on “The Christian
and Love” Wednesday night in
duPont Hall; and on “Sacred Art:
Is it Still Possible?” to a combined
meeting of R. E. Lee Episcopal and
St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic
Churches.

In addition, he attended the con-
cert on Friday night, went to sev-
eral parties around campus, and
went on Sunday morning to a serv-
ice at the Negro Methodist Church.

His own background is impressive,
and made him all the more quali-
fied as a speaker. A member of the}
Dominican Order, he now lives in
Paris working with the artists’ com-
munity. He spent last year at the
University of Mexico as an assistant
Chaplain; has made five films on
art; served as the television director
to Pope Pius XII. During Lent, he
delivered over ninety lectures and
sermons in Quebec.

In his talk Sunday night, Father
Laval began by declaring that art
is not something to be understood,
| but to be felt. All art, if it is really
| art, expresses something of the pres-
| ence of God; therefore, all good art

| is “sacred art.”

‘Cheek Walker Receives IFC
Outstanding Frosh Award

By CHARLES NEWMAN

the Interfraternity Council

IFC Charity Drive and a plan for'
housing foreign students in frater- |
nity houses were discussed. They
also elected the outstanding Fresh-
man for this year.

The IFC Charity Drive was not
as successful this year as the IFC
feels it could have been. It was
decided that the representatives
would ask their individual houses if
they would be willing to support the
fund next year, and if so, how many
people in each house would support
it. From this poll they will determine |
whether or not to further the exist-
ing program.

Exchange Student Housing

 

The idea of placing three foreign
students in fraternity houses has
been discussed before. A list will be|
made up consisting of the fraterni-|
ties that are willing to house one of |
| the students. The student will live

 

and eat at the house. From the
list the IFC will choose three houses.
The cost will be paid by the IFC.
Chuck Walker, Kappa Sigma, from
San Antonio, Texas, was chosen Out-
standing IFC Freshman. Chuck is a

ness staff of the Shenandoah, mem-
ber of the Young Republican Club
and International Relations Club,
and secretary of his fraternity.
The IFC also discussed a_ topic
from the outline of the Student-
Faculty Discussion, which was held
earlier this year. The topic was the
relationship of the fraternity men to
the non-fraternity men and how this
relationship can be improved.
There was also approved a motion
to send three senior IFC members to

“Fear of Change”

Miss Mannes’ speech, entitled
“Fear of Change,” concerned itself
with her conviction that today’s

youth are afraid of variety in life.
She said: “Fear of change makes a
teenager marry her teenage date be-
fore she has a chance to know any
other boy. Fear of change makes a
young man take a sure and boring
job instead of an interesting, adven-
turous one.”

Miss Mannes went on to say that
she felt too many American youths
were allowing themselves to be con-
tent with the status quo. She blam-
ed this factor on a lack of forward-
looking leadership from the govern-
ment, the pupit, the educational sys-
tem, the press, and the business com-
munity. Speaking of the press spe-
cifically, she said: “Both press and
television have their share of cour-
ageous spokesmen who report and
comment truthfully on our life and
times, but overlaying their voices are
a million commercial messages a day
telling us, in one way or another,
that happiness consists of a new
dishwasher, a new car, or a new
hairdo, and that our way of life is
the only way.”

Youth Needs An Open Mind

Miss Mannes pointed out that
many young people close their minds
at an early age to the things which
are aspects of another culture rath-
er than keeping an open mind and
approaching unfamiliar subjects with
reason. She claimed that social, po-
litical, and biological revolutions
are mere surface concerns in com-
parison with the “deep sickness” in
American society: inertia and
atrophy.”

The state of the nation was de-
scribed by Miss Mannes as follows:
“On the one hand, we proclaim our

Christian morality as a society un-
der God. On the other hand, cor-
ruption has spread to a prodigious
degree in ever sector of our life.
It ranges from a two dollar bet to
a twenty-thousand bribe, from falsi-
fiers of tax-returns to a dishonest
city official, from cheaters at ex-
aminations to misleading advertisers,
from corrupt union-leaders to price-
fixing corporations. It would be com-
forting to say that these are ex-
ceptions. The truth is that they have
made the line between legal and
illegal, moral and immoral, so blur-
red that a majority of our people can
no longer see it clearly anymore.”

Miss Mannes’ solution lay in the
hope that the individual will assert
himself actively in our society, and
that individual interests will over-
come the narcotic effects of con-
formity and apathy.

Rebels Without A Cause?

The advent of Spring brings with it a long-standing tra-
dition to our what is normally peaceful campus. This tradition
we cautiously term “rioting,” which we write with quotation
marks since it is no more than a harmless, fun-loving way of
blowing off steam. The tradition is commonly perpetuated
by the freshman class, and early this week the class of 1966
made its contribution.

Of course it’s all in good fun. The freshmen love it, the
upperclassmen love it, the administration loves it, and the dorm
counselors bear it with a minimum of chagrin and frayed
nerves.

But this year’s “riots” almost received a fatal blow. There
was a dire absence of things to riot about. Simply no injustices
could be found outrageous enough to rally spirits. The “‘riot-
ing” came to an embarrassing pause while something had to
be pulled out of the hat.

Once the “riots” got underway—they started without wait-
ing for an issue—some worthy cause was finally hit upon.
It centered on a concern which often visits the editorial page—
the Commons, the campus dining hall. So the “riots” went
along smoothly, everyone got it out of their system, and things
will be quiet for another year.

But should this be the end of the story? What we want to
know is, if the freshmen are showing this fanatical concern for
their stomachs, why doesn’t someone accommodate their de-
mands. If such is the case, no expense should be spared to
meet these needs. Why nonchalantly bypass the issue if that
is where today’s academic interests have focussed?

The freshmen have set high their goals. This is certainly
commendable. By all means, it is up to this university to en-
courage ideal thinking. If it’s the Waldorf-Astoria the fresh-
men want, then why not? Petitions should be drawn up as
soon as possible to voice these demands. Start with a petition
for a revision of the school menu: from now on, the warcry
will be roast duck, tenderloins, and broiled lobster! And with
five o'clock cocktails thrown in!

The source of funds for such a change should not be dif-
ficult to find. For instance, we could cut teachers’ salaries,
research grants, or the library allowance (if the latter can be
cut) and allocate the proceeds to the Commons budget. After
all, if cuisine is the chief interest of our ‘angry young men,”’
this university should take every step to oblige.

The solution is brought before you. Freshmen are en-
couraged to begin their petitions right away. We only ask this:
make sure you don’t do too good a job—leave next year’s

 

freshmen something to be desired.

judged. Some of them will also
sample a bit of college life, or hope-
fully so.

On June 7 the present senior
class will graduate from Washing-
ton and Lee and many of the van-
ishing herd will leave Lexington,
never to return as undergraduates.
Next fall another class of fresh-
men—the thundering herd—will
join the ranks and return to the
university to numerical normali-
ty, but they will never replace
those graduating.

Much has been written about the
changing complexion of the Uni-
versity and whether it is welcome
or not to some it is a fact. We were
relieved to see that Springs this year
seemed to possess echoes of past
great weekends and that the vanish-
ing herd is still letting its presence
be known.

MISCELLANY

Though we have no desire to ini-
tiate a spat on the pages of the
Ring-tum Phi with columnist Pace
of the Tuesday edition for no reason
at all, we feel he has made an
error.

Mr. Pace persists in ranking
“Lolita” as one of the best movies
of 1962 and last Tuesday even
called it the year’s best. Mr.
Pace places a lot of stock, as
he should, in the direction,
reviewing a flick. The observer
feels that adaptation should also
be considered and anyone who
has read “Lolita” realizes that the
movie bears little resemblance to
the book.

The Tuesday reviewer also states
that he laughed more during “Lo-
lita” than any other two-hour period
in his whole life, and we wonder
if the movie was made to be laughed
at. After Peter Seller’s opening hit,
which was truly funny, the movie
Was supposed to become serious.
Many people did in fact laugh
throughout the whole movie and
this to us seems to denote its
failure and should relegate it to the

bottom of the list of the best movies!

The IU Makes Correction
Dear Sir:

As members of the Steering Com-
mittee of the Independent Union,
we thought it would be wise to
clarify some of the points raised by
Mr. Bob Lee in last Tuesday’s
Ring-tum Phi.

In the first place, the Independent
Union did not claim to speak, nor
does it intend to speak for every
non-fraternity student. The Inde-
pendent Union speaks only for those
students who wish to identify with
the Union.

In the second place, no mention
of political parties was made in the
official endorsement of the slate; to
the contrary, the endorsement ex-
plicitly stated that candidates were
being supported on the basis of in-
dividual qualifications, attitudes and
abilities.

The Independent Union will con-
tinue to participate in campus poli-
ties, intramural athletics, and what-
ever other activities its members
see fit. Mr. Lee and his friends are
free to participate or to abstain as
they see fit. But, in the light of the
support given the Union by the other
nonfraternity students during the re-
cent elections, we might wonder just
who has “delusions of grandeur.”....

Is There Any Change?

Dear Sir:

As a concerned member of this
community I was struck by your
statement in last Friday’s Ring-
tum Phi that “Washington and Lee
is undergoing a change.” It would
seem you feel that this change is
in the direction of a more mature}
and intellectual outlook on the part
of the students. What you say may
be true, but let’s look at the record.

Where was this new outlook dur-
ing last Friday’s concert when a
fine artist like Odetta need endure
a disrespectful audience? Or where
was it last weekend when some
“young gentlemen” viciously demol-
ished a room in one of the fraterni-
ty houses? The list of similar oc-
curences, just within this academic
year could go on for pages.

Students guilty of such action as
those mentioned above would seem
unfit for life in the so-called “com-
munity of scholars.” Simple “letting
off steam” can and should be tol-
erated. But why must enjoyment
and good fun dissipate into violence
and vulgarity?

The proper authorities at Wash-
ington and Lee must realize that
they have to take severe disciplinary
action now in order to put an end
to this childish behavior and make
the University’s alleged “new epoch”
a truthful deseription.

Decisions based upon knowledge ,

upon ignorance; the pleasures of
hindsight are negligible. Our Uni-
versity offers many opportunities
for advanced, imaginative, creative,
independent work which most of us, |
I suspect, don’t know about. Here_
are some of them:

In the college: (1) An Interde-.
partmental Major enables a student
to concentrate in a field rather than
a single department. Indepartmental
Majors in the area of General Hu-
manities include Ancient and Me-
dieval Humanities, The Renaissance,
The Ages of Reason and Reforma-
tion, Humanities of the Modern
World, and Modern Humanities.
These majors involve courses in arts,
history, philosophy, and languages |
of the periods studied; for each is
a Spectal Adviser.

Physics-Engineering

There is also an Interdepartmental |
Major in physics-engineering and in.
psychology - biology - sociology. A/|
student may do Honors work for
all these courses of study if he meets |
the Dean’s List Requirements.
(2) Students interested in com-.|

work must apply as sophomores to.

sufficient pre-med work for admis-
sion to medical school, a B.S. degree
in a science with pre-med work, or}
a BS. with a group major in the
sciences and pre-med work.

(5) Believe it or not, W&L has a
co-operative program in engineering
by which a student can earn a BA!
from W&L and a BS. in engineering
from Rensselear Polytechnic Insti-
tute or Columbia University.

(6) Preparation for teaching or

 

| pre-ministerial training is possible

in combination with many major
requirements; special guidance and
counseling is available to interested
students. Honors papers are encour-
aged.
Post-Graduate Work

for post-graduate work at W&L
aside from the admission to the
School of Law. (a) The Scholars of

priately called 100 per cent South-
ernism.

There have been within the last}
few days some disturbances on the |
part of the freshman class—noisy but |
basically harmless demonstrations |
over legitimate grievances—although |
admittedly prompted by Spring |
Fever. |

The administration, however, has!
reacted in a typically infantile and|
foolish manner. We now have pa-)
trol’s of Philip's Gestapo dorm
councilors with searchlights, unre- |
stricted searches (illegal), and
threats of expulsion—all the ele-|
ments of a police state. We are told
that we are immature, but the ad- |
ministration is more so.

Arise, ye trod upon Frosh—you |
have nothing to lose but Slater.

ticularly when
both happen to be
Negroes.

The Negro has
traditionally been
the world’s best
musician. His natural love of rhy-
thm, combined with an approach
to life which is often delightfully
sensuous and carefree, weave rich
patterns of music around all he
does. We believe that the Negro
is still not far from the primitive
earth of his jungle background and
that he often expresses this lush
heritage in his music. That is the
belief. However, the Negro is no
longer an African singing against
an African backdrop; he is an
American singing of things both
past and present—the river boats,
cotton fields, a prostitute’s life in
New Orleans, the blues, the De-
pression, and on and on. There are
no Negroes left now with memories
of Africa of which to sing, but there
are other things to sing about, plen-
ty of other memories; and the Negro
best expresses these musically.

Where does the appeal of the
Negro lie? The question is rhetorical.
Of course, his appeal is to the emo-

   

Kinsey

tional reaction from his audience de-
termines his success as a performer.
Moreover, the response he achieves
is most often an active one, for
the listener is tempted to tap his
foot, clap his hands, or dance. The
rhythm of the musie plants in the
listener’s mind a suggestion which
he follows by moving in time with
the music. Thus is effected a ca-
tharsis.s When the music is over
and all is quiet again, the listener
finds that his level of emotional
intensity has dropped and he thinks
no more about it. He is content.
Music Has Message
Music—all types included—quite
often carries a serious message.
There are probably just as many
songs of protest as there are songs
of love, war, etc. In this respect,
beth the speaker and the enter-
tainer are attempting the same thing,
and neither has accomplished his
goal if he fails to convey a message.
The speaker’s message is intellec-
tual, the entertainer’s sensuous.
The major difference between the
two is that the inspiration or sug-
gestion implanted by the speaker is
not resolved at the time of presen-
tation. It remains within the lisener’s
mind, fermenting and expanding.
The ideas contained in a particular
speech are evaluated by the intel-
ligent listener and either discarded
as worthless or retained as being of
some value.
Singer v. Speaker—Basic Difference
The basie difference, however,
seems to lie somewhere else. The
Negro was brought to this country
to fill a need, the need for slave
labor, to make operable the manorial
agricultural system which existed |

 

 

tions of his listeners. His ability to

New English Studies

In last Tuesday’s edition of this
paper, it was announced that the
English department is offering a new
seminar course to study particular
authors intensively; this is an ex-
cellent idea and one in which the
English department acted in ac-
cordance with other departments.

Both the philosophy and psychol-
ogy departments are dropping their
courses in Directed Readings. Drs.
Hayner and Pemberton are offering
four brand-new courses next year:
Philos. 251-252 (Meaning and Exist-
ence) which will involve study of
the existentialist philosophers, Kant,
and the later dialogues of Plato; 255
(Seience and the Modern World);
256 (Philosophy and Literature): and
267-268 (Modern Philos.) in which
recent Continental, British, and
American philosophers will be stud-
ied.

Psychology Courses

Drs. Hinton and Jarrard have add-
ed a special course in Advanced
Psychology (Psych. 108) which will
relate behavior to physiological
characteristics and the nervous sys-
tem and will require lab work and
individual projects. This latter course
should be of special interest to ma-
jors and pre-meds.

Role As Musician, Not Speaker,
Is Where Negro Gets Pushed

By BILL KINSEY | arouse a response, to evoke an emo-

Sherman to inform the plantation
owner in no uncertain terms that he
would have to find some other way
to do things, the Negro was left with
no clearly defined position. He was
cast afloat with no place to go; and,
indeed, did not even know for what
he was supposed to be seeking. In
the wash of reconstruction years,
however, he fell back into what he
had been doing before the war, but
now for wages. And, in return for
his wages, he provided whatever
might be needed or demanded of
him.

It is this position tht we find the
Negro entertainer today. There is
a need for a commodity and he is
filling it; we have asked him to
entertain and we pay him well
when he does so. His is the position
of one supplying service, and, ‘there-
fore, he is no more nor no less than
a paid employee. However, with the
speaker it is different. His commod-
ity lies in the realm of ideas, goods
which are not easily subjected to
the rules of simple commerce. In
the case of most guest speakers,
payment is merely token; the prime
concern is with the free exchange of
ideas. But with the Negro speaker
we have the ease of one who pro-
offers something which is quite often
not desired. Because we have not
asked for it or experienced a need
for it, we feel that it is worthless or,
more than that, harmful. We do not
seek communication on such a high
level with the Negro. As far as
we are concerned, all his appeal is
to the senses and not to the intellect.
There is some vague fear that, if
all the things the Negro’s music
conveys were expressed in _ ideas,
which might catch hold, there would
be hell to pay.

Curious, isn’t it?

Cindermen Come From Behind

To Defeat Lynchburg College

The

men came from behind to stage

a surprising vietory by wholloping |

Lynchburg College 70-52 last Tues-
day at Lynchburg Stadium. For a
while it looked as if W&L might be
upset and fall victim to a strong but
inferior Lynchburg team. After los-
ing most of the sprints and three
of the field events the Generals
tightened in the clutch and took the
meet running away.

Robin Kell again figured largely
in the victory. He contributed a 53.8
lap in the relay, a third place, 20-
41% leap in the broad jump and a
first place, 6-0 jump in the high
jump. Also outstanding in the meet
was freshman Don Casto who placed
third in the 100-yard dash with
a time of 10.25, and second in the
220-yard dash with a time of 22.9.

the customs regulations will allow. And if by chance you should
run out of Marlboros in Europe, do not despair. That familiar
red and white Marlboro package is as omnirresent in Europe
as it is in all fifty of the United States. And it is the same
superb cigarette you find at home—the same pure white filter,
the same zestful, mellow blend of tobaccos preceding the filter.
This gem of the tobacconist’s art, this prodigy of cigarette
engineering, was achieved by Marlboro’s well-known research
team —Fred Softpack and Walter Fliptop—and I, for one, am
grateful.

But T digress. We were speaking of Franee—or the Serpent of
the Nile, as it is popularly termed.

Let us first briefly sum up the history of France. The nation
was discovered in 1066 by Madame Guillotine. There followed
a series of costly wars with Schleswig-Holstein, the Cleveland
Indians, and Jean Jacques Rousseau. Stability finally came to
this troubled land with the coronation of Marshal Foch, who
married Lorraine Alsace and had three children: Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Charlemagne. This later beeame known as the Petit Trianon.

Marshal Foch—or the Boy Orator of the Platte, as he was
affectionately called—was sueceeded by Napoleon, who intro-
duced shortness to France. Until Napoleon the French were
the tallest nation in Europe. After Napoleon most Frenchmen
were able to walk comfortably under card tables. This later
became known as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

Napoleon, after his defeat by Credit Mobilier, was exiled to
Elba, where he made the famous statement, ‘‘Able was I ere I
saw Elba.” This sentence reads the same whether you spell it
forward or backward. You can also spell Marlboro backward —
Oroblram. Do not, however, try to smoke Marlboro backward
because that undoes all the pleasure of the finest cigarette made.

After Napoleon’s death the French people fell into a great fit
of melancholy, known as the Louisiana Purchase. For over a
century everyone sat around moping and refusing his food.
This torpor was not lifted until Eiffel built his famous tower,
whieh made everybody giggle so hard that today France is the
gayest ecoustry in Europe.

Each night the colorful natives gather at sidewalk cafes and
shout “Oo-la-la!’”’ as Maurice Chevalier promenades down the
Champs Elysees swinging his malacca cane. Then, tired but
happy, everyone goes to the Louvre for bowls of onion soup.

The principal industry of France is cashing travellers checks.

Well sir, | guess that’s all you need to know about France.
Next week we will visit the Land of the Midnight Sun—Spain.

© 1963 Max Shuiman

whole world over is filter-tipped Marlboros—soft pack or
Flip-Top box—you get a lot to like.

lay will be needed to finance this
project.

For the many-faceted program, the
faculty in Journalism currently does

the best it can with improvised
quarters in three buildings. The
department has a “makeshift” city

room, no audio-visual room, only
partial broadcasting facilities, not
enough offices for the faculty, and
a lack of storage space.

The Department of Journalism
here was the first college level
instruction of its type offered any-
where in the world and was
founded by Robert E. Lee almost
100 years ago.

One of the relatively few de-
partments of its type to be fully
aecredited by the American Coun-
cil of Education for Journalism,
W&L is rated in competition with
the best and largest schools of Jour-
nalism throughout the country.

 

FREE CHEST X-RAYS

On May 7, free chest x-rays will
be given for university students
from 8:30 a.m. till 5:00 p.m. at the
dormitory parking lot. An x-ray
takes only a few seconds. Besides
detecting TB, a chest x-ray can
spot lung cancer and an enlarged
heart. In 1962, 90 per cent of the
new cases in Rockbridge County
were in an advanced stage. If de-
tected early, TB can be cured
quickly. There is no danger whatso-
ever from radiation in an x-ray.
It is recommended that a healthy
individual have one chest ?-ray a
year. Individuals who smoke should
especially plan to have an x-ray.
