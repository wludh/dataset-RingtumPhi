300 Alumni
To Return

Washington and _ Lee’s
Openings Dance Set begins to-
day with the Zeta Beta Tau
Cocktail Party given in honor
of Openings President Tom
Supak, at the Mayflower, from
4-6 p.m. The Del Vikings,
known for such hits as ‘“Whis-
perin’ Bells’ and “Come Go
With Me,” will provide en-
tertainment, and a grain punch
will be served.

The Vice-Presidents of Openings
are: Syd Butler, SAE ,in charge
of the figure; Brice Gamber, DTD,
miscellaneous; Barry Greene, ZBT,
cocktail party chairman; Alen
Holilomon, Phi Gam, decorations
chairman; Jon Supak, ZBT, pub-
licity chairman; and Randy Woot-
ton, Phi Delt, in charge of tickets
and invitations.

Clyde McPhatter and his 15-piece
orchestra will take the spotlight at
the Openings Dance in Doremus
Gymnasium from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. on
Friday. Dress is formal for stu-
dents and their dates. The theme
will be a “Peppermint Lounge Twist
Party,” with appropriate decorations.

An experienced performer who

*has been on the best-seller list for
| ten years, McPhatter is a _ style-
setter with his vocal tricks and ef-
fortless upper register. Formerly a
key figure in the Dominoes and the
Drifters, well known groups, he has
been on his own since his release
from the Army in 1956. He has many
hits to his credit, including “Little
Bitty Pretty One,” “Lovey Dovey,”

“Honey Love,’ and “Treasure of
Love.”
The candidates for Homecoming

Queen will be presented during the
intermission. Dr. Keith Shillington

will announce and crown the Queen.

A Pat On

The Back

Dance Board President Frank Young has been waving a
magic wand in Doremus Gym, transforming the basketball
court into a suitable dance floor. Young is to be congratulated
on the superior quality of entertainment lined up and de-
serves a pat on the back for rallying the enthusiasm of the
student body to almost unanimous participation.

Tom Supak, a ZBT junior, has served as a fine Openings
Dance president. We should extend our full support to him

and his vice-presidents.

Welcome Alumni

An estimated 300 alumni will be returning this weekend
to converge on Lexington’s busiest weekend since the 1960
Mock Convention. They certainly should not find any lack of
excitement or entertainment. The “Shrine of the South” is
being hit not only by the Homecoming -Openings festivities of
We&L, but also with Parents’ Day and a home football game
at VMI. For the next two days, Lexington will be one maze of
trafic jams and swarming crowds.

To the adventurous alumni who are brave enough to show
up, the University extends a hearty welcome, and our felicita-
tions on surviving the chaos of the weekend.

 

Dance Weekend Centers
On ‘Twist Party’ Theme

By FRANK YOUNG
Friday Columnist

Tonight at 9 p.m. in Doremus Gym-
nasium marks the debut of the
_ 1962-63 University
Dance Board sea-
son. Clyde Mc-
Phatter and his
15-piece rock and
roll orchestra will
| supply the enter-
> tainment for the
9 to 1 formal
dance which will
be set to the
: theme of a “Pep-
oung permint Lounge
. Twist Party.”
The doors to the gymnasium will
open at 8:30 p.m., and McPhatter
will be on stage at 9 p.m. sharp.
Openings President Tom Supak, his
vice-presidents, and the Dance Board
Advisory Council will be prestened
at 10 p.m. Following the Openings
figure, McPhatter and his orchestra
will again perform until the 11 p.m.
intermission, at which time the 17
fraternity Homecoming Queen dele-
gates and their escorts will bow to
the student body.

Clyde McPhatter is no newcomer
to the rock and roll scene. Sky-
rocketing to fame early in 1955,
the tenor singer has remained an
outstanding performer throughout
his career. He is particularly re-
membered for such gold record-
ings as “Lover Please,” “The
Treasure of Love,” and “Ta Ta.”
The versatility which McPhatter
and his orchestra display lends it-
self perfectly to a college dance,
as the group is capable of playing
practically any type of dance
music.

Doremus Gymnasium will again be
the setting for the Saturday night
rock and roll concert from 8 to
10. The entertainment for this func-
tion will be supplied by three of
the outstanding popular recording
artists in the country today in the
persons of the Shirelles, the Coast-
ers, and King Curtis. Students are
requested to be in the gym and
seated by 8 p.m. Curtis and his
group will be performing instru-
mentally from 7:30 to 8 as_ the
students enter the gymnasium.

Originally from Plainsfield, New
Jersey, the Shirelles have been the
dominant female singing group in
the country since 1959. Their lengthy
list of hits includes such numbers

“Will You Love Me Tomorrow,”
“Welcome Home Baby,” and “Soldier

with Curtis for the past year and
have recently cut an album with
him entitled “The Shirelles and

Curtis is remembered in his own
right for “The Soul Twist” and
“Beach Party.”

The Coasters, who will open the
Saturday night concert, are also one
of the outstanding rock and roll
groups in the nation. Appearing at
8 p.m., the group will be singing

such numbers as “Searching,”
“Along Came Jones,” and “Poison
Ivy.”

Clyde McPhatter, the Shirelles,

the Coasters and King Curtis head-
line Openings. Homecoming weekend
will offer W&L students the largest
rock and roll show in its history.
Capacity crowds are expected for
what promises to be the best college
rock and roll wekend of the year.

 

  
 
    

  

Letters
To The
Editor...

The ‘'13” Club Strikes

Office of the Editor
Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

I am writing as a member emeri-
tus of “13” in reply to Mr. Lane’s
brilliant editorial comment and
masterpiece, which recently appear-
ed about our organization in the
paper. Mr. Lane, you present your-
self as being quite well informed
as to what we stand for and what
we are for and against. I speak
as a member in saying that you as
a non-member are quite uninformed.
We are for thirteen days of noise
betwen classes on the colonade, for
being “secret” and for being com-
rades in little more than this. We
are against the ass who yearly
lowers himself to devoting space in
the Ring-tum Phi to assailing us.

Thank you for your article and
your opposition. We have each justi-
fied the other’s existence for an-
other year.

Humbly submitted,
RALPH C. WIEGANDT

 

Collegian Delayed
By Late Ads

Dear Sir,

Due to circumstances far beyond
the control of the editorial or busi-
ness staff, the Southern Collegian
will not appear this weekend. The
very efficient ad printers employed
by the Collegian in New York who
run off the national ads have once
again “booted the ball.”

Since the cover ads have not ar-
rived, we are unable to distribute
the magazine.

The Collegian will probably appear
Nov. 10 when W&L plays Sewanee
at home.

Thank you for your patience and
have one ---- of a weekend.

New Science Facilities
To Be On Display For Alumni

Washington and Lee Uni-
versity alumni returning for
homecoming festivities this
weekend will get the first pub-
lic look at the university’s new
$1,252,000 science facilities.

The new four-story building for
physics and biology and the reno-
vated existing science building will
undergo alumni inspection Saturday
morning. Although the facilities were
placed in use when classes began
in mid-September, contractors have
not yet completed finishing touches
to the buildings.

Alumni throughout the country
contributed funds for the science
facilities during a two-year de-
velopment campaign conducted
by Washington and Lee from 1959
to 1961.

For the second consecutive year,| |
homecoming activities and the tra-| |
ditional opening dance set coincide. | |
Although homecoming does not get! !

underway officially until Saturday’s
9 am. registration, alumni, their
wives and guests have been invited
to dance to the music of Clyde
McPhatter and his orchestra begin-

ning at 9 p.m. Friday in Doremus| |

Gymnasium. The Coasters, the Shi-
relles and King Curtis and his group
will entertain at a “rock ’n roll”
concert Saturday at 8 p.m. in the
gymnasium.

Among the top events of the week-
end will be the 2 p.m. football
game between Washington and Lee’s
Generals and Johns Hopkins’ Blue
Jays. When Johns Hopkins last met
Washington and Lee on Wilson Field
in 1960, the match ended in an
8-8 tie. This game proved to be the
only blot on the Generals’ record
in 21 games—a streak that ended
Oct. 6 in a 38-33 loss to Emory &
Henry.

 

Washington and Lee will face

Old Dominion College of Norfolk
in cross-country beginning at 2:45 |
p.m. Saturday.

Washington and Lee President and |
Mrs. Fred C. Cole will honor re-|
turning alumni at a 10:30 a.m. cof-
fee Saturday at the President’s
home. A noon luncheon in Evans
Dining Hall and a post-game recep-

 

 

tion are also on the schedule.

The homecoming queen—select-
ed from candidates submitted by
the university’s 18 social fraterni-
ties—will be presented for the first
time at Friday’s formal dance. She
also will be presented during the
halftime ceremonies at the foot-
ball game.

The 12-man Alumni Board of
| Trustees—governing body of Wash-
ington and Lee’s Alumni Associa-
tion—will meet at 2:30 Friday. Rod-
ney M. Cook, a 1946 graduate from
Atlanta, is current president of the
Alumni Association Fund Council, a
six-man group that directs the an-

nual Alumni Fund Campaign.

B.V. Offers “Broadening Horizons”
To Students Seeking Diversion

By SANDY FENN

Once in a while everyone should
get out of Lexington, if only for
__a few short hours.
; It clears your
head, it sharpens
your. senses, it
broadens your in-
tellectual horizon,
it tempers’ the
fiber of your ex-
- istence. When you
return, you will
have a new sense
of well being and
oneness with the
world. I urge that
you all go to Washington and listen
to the National Symphony or go to
New York and see a good Broadway
play. Or...do as I did last Sunday
afternoon... go to B.V. to see Hatari.

There I was away from the rou-
tine of life at W&L. There I was

   

Fenn

seeing something of the world. There |
I was paying ten cents less to see the | |

unexpurgated version of a flic in
glorious, wide-screen technicolor
than I would have to pay to see
the expurgated version in Lexington.

As I walked down the aisle, the
sound of rock and roll music
reahced my ears. It reminded me
vaguely of a combo we once had
which was so bad that we paid
them to leave halfway through the
evening. We gently explained to
them that we had an epidemic of
Mongolian Jungle Rot sweeping
through the house that weekend.

I sat down and let my eyes ad-
just to the darkness. There they
were off in the darkest corners,
squinting through the gloom with
beady, white eyes and exchanging
furtive kisses. Ah, to be young
again...and in love!

I shifted slightly in my seat as
the Foghorn Leghorn cartoon flash-
ed across the screen. I became so
intrigued by the cartoon’s allegorical
depth that I scarcely noticed the

 

 

two men in sleeveless, oderiferous T

shirts... that is until they sat down
beside me.
Popcorn

They were munching popcorn
and arguing about the presence
of God in Red China today. Their
basic theory was that Mao Tse-
tung was having the same rotten
breaks with the weather that
the Pharaoh ran into when he
wouldn't let the Children of Is-
rael out of slavery. They went on
to compare Chiang Kai-shek to
Moses, as an emancipated leader

 

“Power corrupts, and absolute pow- |
er corrupts absolutly.’—Lord Acton

The preceding quotation has no
possible connection with the abstract
babblings which will follow, but it
possesses a certain
ring of truth to it
and, more import-
ant, it is one of
the few quotes I
have ever com-
mitted to memory.

With an esti-
mated influx of
some one thou-

sand dates and
Homecomers, plus

Alford a goodly num-
ber of _ soldiers’
parents, our bucolic little hamlet

should really be swinging this week-
end. We hope this initial big dance
weekend of the year will proceed
in true W&L style (if this is still
possible).

Two W&L Injuries
For Homecomings

By NICK MONSARRATT
Asst. Sports Editor

Homecoming will be warm for
Washington and Lee’s football team
this Saturday but injuries may put
a damper on the Generals’ running
attack when they meet Johns Hop-
kins.

Halfback Henry Sackett, who
was vying for state high scoring
honors with Earl Hawkins of Em-
ory and Henry, is still a question
mark in the starting line-up. He
suffered a sprained ankle in last
week’s 18-13 win over Randolph-
Macon and it has failed to re-
spond to treatment. Sophomore
Skip Chase has been named by
Coach Lee McLaughlin as Sack-
ett’s replacement.

Senior guard Mickey Walker will
be out for his second week

Emory and Henry game. Junior Bill
Gossman will replace Walker on the
blue unit.

The man to watch for the Blue
Jays is 160 pound quarterback
Gerry Pfeifer, who appears to be
heading for a Johns Hopkins total
offense record. In the Blue Jay’s
three games he has averaged 180
yards, which would bring his total
to 1,440 in their season of eight
games, 262 yards more than the
1958 record.

Pfeifer may be expected to pass
a great deal, and with his favorite
receiver John Cox at 6’ 3” the
Generals could see some trouble.

Washington and Lee’s fullback,
Tommy Keesee, who will provide
the Generals’ land power as he
hopes to better his 164 yards on
the ground in last week’s game
against Randolph-Macon, Stu Yof-
fe will also seek to meet the
Blue Jays’ passing threat by re-

as al
result of a leg injury received in the |

peating his hard ground game of
last week.

Johns Hopkins will come to Lex-
ington with a 2-1 record, as they
beat both Franklin and Marshall and
Haverford decisively, and lost to
Ursinus 20-12.

The Blue Jays’ starting left end,
Mike Hobbs, is the brother of last
year’s captain of the Washington
and Lee undefeated team.

 

Pagano Named
Star Of Week

Co-captain Bob Pagano has been
cited by the Washington and Lee
. soccer coaching
staff as this week’s
most outstanding
performer for his
inspired play in
the Generals’ 3-1
upset over Lynch-
burg College.

The talented
center forward
didn’t hit the
scoring column
against Lynch-
burg but was in-
strumental in W&L’s attack through-
out the game. However, he did
pick up an assist for the first Gen-
eral score.

Coach Lyles calls Pagano the

of Washington and Lee’s forward
line as he has been an outstanding
factor in every game this season.

Lyles went on to say that Pagano
is the type of ball player who “gives
that 110 per cent effort, always
putting out more than expected.”

Pagano has only one goal this

Soccer Team Upsets Lynchburg

Teamwork Cited
As Deciding Factor

By DICK KREITLER
Staff Reporter
The Washington and Lee soccer
team defeated Lynchburg College
for the first time in seven years on
Wednesday by a decisive 3-1 score.

The Generals got ofl to a quick
start as mid-way through the first
period Tim Henry scored from
right-inside assisted by Bob Pa-
gano to give the Generals a 1-0
lead,

Steve Hibbard kept the scoring
going for Washington and Lee by
putting one past the Lynchburg
goalie for a comfortable 2-0 margin.

Lynchburg came back toward
the end of the third quarter with
Jim Stokes scoring on a _ kick-in
to cut down the General lead.

Washington and Lee wasn’t
through scoring until Jim Mell
placed one into the nets from fif-
teen yards out.

Tom Green, the W&L_ goal-
tender, was one of the key factors
in the team’s victory by saving
fourteen Lynchburg shots.

The forward line’s attack was
led by surefooted Bob Pagano and
Steve Hibbard who were most in-
strumental in controlling the play
for the Generals.

At left halfback Bruce Jackson
turned in an exceptionally fine per-
formance even though he was han-
dicapped by an injury for most of
the game.

Tom Clements, in the center half-
back slot turned in his finest defen-
sive performance of the season.

Coach Lyles was more pleased
with this win than any other since
he began coaching here, four years
ago. He said that the Generals dis-
played the best teamwork that he
has ever seen in a college soccer
game.

Lyles went on to say that “this
was the best soccer game played
at W&L in years.”

This Friday the booters will face
a tough test when they meet Duke
University in Durham. They will be
seeking to better their 4-1 season
record.

Thursday, November 1.

Coach Norris Eastman once again |
faces a tough swimming season with |
such foes as American University, |
East Carolina College and the Uni- |
versity of Maryland.

However, a force of twelve re-|
turning lettermen, including record- |
holding captain Herb Jahncke and_|
John Wolfe, bring strength and
depth to the team. Mike Harris, a)
senior letterman, will return to de-
fend his 100-yard backstroke rec-
ord.

All in all Coach Eastman expects
to have a team numbering forty to
fifty men, most of them with pre-
vious competitive experience.

Of the freshmen that Eastman
has seen ,three or four have im-
pressed him. However, with the

Reflections of Telstar

Remember the picture above? It flashed across your
television screen on a hot night last July. Perhaps
you remember that it originated from France. And
that it reached the U.S. via Telstar, the world’s first
private enterprise communications satellite.

Since that summer night, the Bell System’s Telstar
has relayed electronic signals of many types —tele-
vision broadcasts, telephone calls, news photographs,
and others.

But there’s one Telstar reflection you might have
missed. Look into the faces of the Bell System people
below and you'll see it. It is the reflection of Telstar’s

success that glowed brightly on the faces of all wh
shared in the project. eg

Their engineering, administrative and operations
skills created Telstar and are bringing its benefits’
down out of the clouds to your living room.

These Bell System people, through their talented,
dedicated efforts, make your phone service still better,
more economical, and more useful.

The reflections of Telstar are many.
