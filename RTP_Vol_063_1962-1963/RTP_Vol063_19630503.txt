ESQUIRE Film Critic MacDonald

Speaks Of Cinema Renaissance

Dwight MacDonald, famed Amer-
ican movie critic, last night address-
ed students and faculty members in
duPont Auditorium. Mr. MacDonald,
film critic for Esquire and a staff
writer for The New Yorker, spoke
on “The Cinema Today: Avant-
Garde and Rear Guard.”

In his talk, Mr. MacDonald stated
that the cinema is most interesting
form of art. To him, the theater, in
America and Europe, is of no inter-

est. As a basis for this belief, he
said he has seen many movies more
than once, but that there is yet a

play that he has ever wanted to see
more than once.

The talk ended with a discussion
of American and European films. In
Europe films are made by individ-

American spectaculars. The Euro-

Lane president; Brice Gamber, vice
president of the commerce school;
Ed Croft, vice president of the arts
school; Jere Cravens, vice president
of the science school; Conway Shield,
secretary. There was a tie in the
race for historian, between Tom
Pace and Pete Candler.

In the rising junior class Dillard
Munford was elected president; Steve
Smith vice president; Brooks Brown
secretary; and Bob Patton historian.
The rising sophomores elected John
Moore president; Birnie Harper vice
president; Dave Gordon secretary;
and Doug Morrison historian.

The senior class of the Law School
elected Ed MacKinley president; Ben

The intermediate class of the Law
School elected Bill Anderson presi-
dent; Fred Casto vice president;
Roger Kelsey secretary; and Clint

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

 

During the last few days, there has been
a great deal of heated discussion over the
merits of Lamar Lamb’s proposal that the
present penalty for a violation of the Honor
System be reduced from absolute expulsion
to automatic expulsion for one year, with the
convicted student eligible for reinstatement
upon review of his case by the Executive Com-
mittee. The editors of the Tuesday edition do
not consider the Honor System a Sacred Cow,
and welcome discussion of Mr. Lamb’s propo-
sal. Nevertheless, we disagree with the pro-
posal, and consider it one of the most poorly
formulated ideas to be seriously presented be-
fore the student body in recent memory. In
support of the proposal, Lamb and his follow-
ers offer a wide variety of reasons for change,
some of which are downright false, and all of
which hold little or no water. This editorial
will debate the merits of each reason.

THE “SOCIETY” ANALOGY...

1. Lamb, in his mimeographed letter
Thursday night, states that we punish a violat-
or here much more than they would be pun-
ished elsewhere. From this rather obvious fact,
he manages to conclude that students who are
convicted of an Honor System violation can-
not get into other schools, a conclusion which
is false. Students who are convicted here
regularly enroll in other institutions, as Dean
Atwood can testify. Lamb, an EC member,
should know better. As a matter of fact, we
defy him to offer as evidence a case in which
a convicted student has been unable to enroll
in another college. Further, the fact that
“society” does not penalize as we do here does
not mean we must conform: society, we might
point out, has a big problem with lying, cheat-
ing, and stealing.

“SPURIOUS” ASSUMPTIONS...

2. As the second point in his letter, Lamb
states that “our punishment assumes that if a
person does something dishonorable once, he
is forever dishonorable. This assumption is
spurious.” We agree, the assumption is spur-
ious. It’s so spurious, in fact, that no one
makes it. The Honor System does not presume
to declare a man forever dishonorable: it only
states that a student who has not the will
power to refrain from lying, cheating, or steal-
ing does not belong at Washington and Lee.
In the light of innumerable benefits of the
Honor System (and we can ennumerate them
if you like), is that too much to ask?

THE PRINCIPAL OF FORGIVENESS ...

3. As his third point, Lamb and his coterie
invoke Christianity, declaring that the present
expulsion violates the principle of forgive-
ness. The principle of forgiveness, when im-
properly used (as it is in this case) is an all-
purpose platitude which could be used to out-
law everything from speeding tickets on up.
We certainly have no quarrel with Christianity,
and we agree that forgiveness is admirable.
But we are leery of the practical applicability
of forgiveness. In case after case, other insti-
tutions have found that the introduction of
graduated penalities into an Honor System
has caused the downfall of the system: student
body officers from other schools (notably

Goldwater—W ill Public Opinion ‘Draft’ Him as Nominee

The Honor System Defended

Wake Forest and Hampden-Sydney) on cam-
pus for an ODK convention this week-end
have stressed this fact. And there is one other
important point: Lamb says we must forgive
because we “‘cannot allow a man’s life to be
ruined.” This is a rather broad statement, and
adds a note of melodrama to the argument.
We certainly do not deny that conviction of an
Honor Court violation is a highly disturbing
experience, but does it ruin a man’s life? Is
a convicted student’s life really made unbear-
able and worthless? Again, we must ask Mr.
Lamb to provide evidence for his argument.

THE CLINCHER...

4. And then Mr. Lamb provides the clinch-
er: he says that absolute expulsion was only
instituted thirty years ago. This statement is
completely false, and is typical of the hap-
hazard nature of the proposal. And we might
add that the editors of the Ring-tum Phi which
appeared last Saturday reprinted this state-
ment, knowing that it had no foundation in
fact. Actually, the present penalty has been
in effect since the Honor System first took
its present form, somewhere between 1870
and 1890.

SAVING THE INDIVIDUAL...

5. Another argument, set forth by Protest,
is that the individual suffers at the hands of
a sterile system. This is mere word-play. The
proponents of this argument, in their haste
to come to the aid of the “individual,” forget
the one thousand and fifty other individuals
who benefit from the “‘sterile”’ system.

6. Finally, there is the ‘Great Taboo of
Tradition” argument. We are told that we are
cowards, “‘cloaked” in this tradition, and that
Lamar Lamb has come to lead us out of the
darkness and into the light. What, may we
ask, is so horrifying about tradition, and why
should we do away with a tradition which,
over the years, has provided so many very real
benefits?

In conclusion, we would like to offer an
argument of our own. We firmly believe that
the very great majority of students at Wash-
ington and Lee subscribe to an abstract code
of honesty, that the students here believe that
it is wrong to lie, cheat, or steal. This means
that a violation of the Honor System is a much
greater offense than, for example, failing out
of school. If, however, we allow a student
who has been convicted of an Honor System
violation to return, we are, in effect, saying
that lying, cheating, and stealing are really
not so bad, and the Honor System, as it has
done in so many other schools, will quickly
degenerate into a strictly punitive system in
which honesty is not a matter of respect, but a
matter of what one can get away with. Because
of our Honor System, students here may en-
joy the self-satisfaction that comes when one
knows that he is trusted, and may enjoy the
convenience of being able to trust other stu-
dents. And all we have to do to maintain the
system is refrain from lying, cheating, or steal-
ing. When the entire system is at stake, is it
too much to ask that those very few students
who cannot do so be permanently expelled?

We don’t think it is.

Washington and Lee is fast ap-
proaching a moment of decision
which may well affect the future of
this University’s position of leader-
ship in the area of higher education,
not only in the South, but in the
entire nation as well. The great de-
bate over the proposed, and opposed,
integration of Washington and Lee
grows in fervor and intensity with
each passing day. And it would seem
evident that sooner or later (prob-
ably sooner), W&L will have to
take its stand.

Whether we like it or not, the
days are forever past when we
could sweep the whole question
of race relations under a carpet
or dignified neutrality, in such a
situation. It is clearly the respon-
sibility of every one of us who is
concerned about Washington and
Lee’s welfare—students, faculty,
the administration, the alumni—to
ponder seriously in his own mind
the personal stand which he must
take on this question.

But it is upon the _ individual
member of the student body that
the greatest responsibility falls. As
with any other university, we are
Washington and Lee’s most import-
ant raison d’etre. And as such we
must make our voices heard on the
very real issues which are sure to
touch us.

But how many of us really know
what we want to say? In the current

Editor
The Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

The Friday issue of the Ring-tuia
Phi was overly generous in identi-
fying me with the new catalogue re-
vision. However, Governor Darden
advised us here Friday evening
that a person should never deny
anything good said about him. So
rather than deny the editor’s kind
remarks, I would like to see that
others involved in the catalogue
revision receive deserving credit.

Without the splendid cooperation
of the various deans, chiefly Dean
Pusey and Dean Gilliam, the heads
of the academic departments, and
above all, my assistant, Mrs. Robert

 

discussions about integration in the
columns of the Ring-tum Phi, and
in bull sessions in fraternity houses
and dormitories, it seems that an ex-
tremist few on both sides of the
situation are doing all the talking.
This is deplorable. The problem be-
longs to all of us. It is up to all of us,
then, to attempt to solve it.

And yet a_ well-thought-out
view of the issue, based on fact
rather than cliches is a prerequi-
site for intelligent participation in
any debate. The contention that
integration is “obviously right”
or “obviously wrong” has no place
in our academic community. If
something is “obvious,” there can
me no dispute about it—only
agreement and acceptance. Such is
the case here.

The time has come when clear-
thinking men of good will on both
sides of this important question must
enter into honest dialogue with each

other in order to find an answer that
will

best serve the interests of
Washington and Lee.
There are many people, in all

areas of the life of this University,
who feel that Washington and Lee
will be integrated within ten years,
if not sooner. If this estimate is cor-
rect and it appears to be so, then
it is incumbent upon every one of us
to be ready for it when it comes.

The days ahead may not be easy
ones. There will be hurt feelings,
anger, even hatred. Old friendships
will collapse. The University com-
munity could possibly be split ir-
reparably asunder. It has happened
elsewhere; it could well happen
here. To avert such a tragedy, let us
begin today to examine together the
whole question of the integration
of Washington and Lee on a basis
of real love and understanding. Per-
haps then we shall come to know
the truth, and as with all other
things, the truth shall make us free.

Having repaired to the Paramount
to mull over the various class elec-
tions we have
come up with sev-
eral observations.
Did Lamar Lamb
win a junior E.C.
post because of
the party, the is-
sue, or the man?
His running mate,
Malcolm Morris,
fared equally well
numerically in
the voting yet he
campaigned
against Lamb’s stand— to replace
expulsion with a year of absence
for an honor offense.

The observer concludes that the
issue played a minor part in the
election of Lamb to the party and
the man. Lamb’s proposal now will
be fully discussed by next year’s
Executive Committee, aired in the
Ring-tum Phi and among stu-
dents as it should be—after which
we hope it is soundly defeated by
the EC.

Brief Review

brought David Gerald Gordon,
known affectionately as the “Fly,”
into office as secretary. The bandy-
legged freshman, independent, a
truely popular man in his class, ran
against the grip of party cliques and
was successful at the “polls” to win
the post.

It is equally refreshing to see
the obviously best qualified man
win an office regardless of party
affiliation or political engineering.
Art Broadus was elected last night
by acclamation to become the
president of next year’s LF.C.
Broadus’ keen interest in the fu-
ture of fraternities, experience on
the Council and respect with the
faculty and administration should
make him one of the best leaders
that body has had.

We hear a great deal on campus
and in state and national elections
about how little one individual’s
vote counts. In the rising senior class
elections for historian. Tom Pace
and Pete Candler are tied at 97
votes apiece, requiring as we under-
stand it a re-vote. Each vote counted
heavily in that election as each vote,
ultimately, counts in every demo-
cratic election.

Presidential Nom

inations, Part One

 

By JAMES HYATT
Staff Columnist

Goldwater for president? You're
out of your mind if you think it’s
not possible. Millions of conserva-
tives seem to be promulgating the
idea from Massachusetts to Cali-
fornia. What does this wirey-haired,
bespectacled Senator from Arizona
have that attracts the populace?
Many would have us believe it is a
political philosophy. Hopefully, this
writer will consider the Senator's
philosophy as the prime motivation
behind the move to draft him for
the presidential nomination. How-
ever, a discussion on conservatism
is not the point of this article. An
attempt is being made to summarize
the latest political moves across this
nation to align the voters behind
“the winner” in 1964,

An Outsanding Record

Senator Goldwater has an envia-
ble past. His record shows that he
is amply educated; (a graduate of
Staunton Military Academy and an

 

alumnus...attended one year... of
the University of Arizona,) comes
from a wealthy family; is a Briga-
dier General in the U.S.A.F. res.; is
a young 52; has sired four children;
been a city council man for three
years; a Senator of the United
States since 1954; is the leading rep-
resentative of the conservative wing
of the Republican Party; serves on
Interior and Insular Affairs Com-
mittee; Labor and Public Welfare
Committee; and Navajo and Hopi
Indian Administration Committee;
and, hold onto your hats, is a Sigma
Chi! With the possible exception
of the last named item, Senator
Goldwater is, and has been, free
of any seandal during his political
career.

A month ago Barry Goldwater
definitely asserted that he was not a
candidate for the Presidency; that
he was hoping to continue as Sena-
tor; and that any move to prompt
him into the limelight would be to
no avail. This past week has brought
another tune from the Arizonian.

 

Headquarters are being set up in
Texas, Washington, D.C., and other
states, with the sole purpose of
gaining convention votes, via popu-
lar demand, to draft Goldwater at
the Republican convention in 1964.
Goldwater's comments? “I have giv-
en up trying to stop it....But I
don’t think that I could get the nom-
ination for President even if I went
after it....” The Senator’s humble-
ness overwhelmed his campaign
manager who said, “Oh hell, give up,
and see what happens, Barry.” This
writer feels that millions will join
the already swelling mass of “Gold-
waterites” just to prove that an un-
derdog can win in America, Sound
familiar?

Rockefeller’s Success

Governor Rockefeller might erell
prove to be the key to success in
nominating Mr. Goldwater. The Gov-
ernor’s aides have signs already
painted which read, “...for Presi-
dent.” They are hopefully expecting
to put in “Rocky” but a few minor

altercations seem to be hindernmg
the political artistry. Some claim the
paint pot should be smeared in tne
blank and their reasons have a cer-
tain degree of merit. I think it only
fair to cover his better side firss,
which, without a doubt, overshad-
ows all the recent “scandals.” Of
course, it is rumored that Nelso.
Rockefeller comes from a wealthy
family, just like Kennedy and
Seranton, ete. His public service
background is outstanding and even
his opposition admits this fact.
Rockefeller is in his second term as
Governor of New York State, win-
ning, both times, by a substantial
margin. The Governor's first term
brought solvency to N.Y.S. through
tax inereases and when a surplus
was formed, he ordered a tax cut
instead of dreaming up new bureaur-
cratic ways of spending it. Busi-
ness had clamored to get into his
state, offering more jobs to the citi-
zens. Rockefeller is definitely not
one to look for federal handouts on
behalf of New York. He preserves

 

WELL, NOW, WASN'T THAT
THOUGHTFUL OF HER? NICE LITTLE
FLANNEL SQUARES... JUST THE
SORT THAT ONE MIGHT GET IF
ONE CUT UP ONES... ..cccese

 

 

 

 

 

states’ rights by exercising state re-
sponsibility. And, last, Rockefeller
is a staunch defender of the “hard
line” in the cold war.

The Result of Remarriage

But what does the future hold for
Mr. Rockefeller? Passing quickly
through such matters as his legisla-
ture balking when he sneaked a tax
inerease in under “ another name”
this year, and that matter of Judson
Morehouse accepting liquor money
from a Playboy bunny and_ then
claiming immunity, quiting his job
and retiring to his estate, we get
to Mrs. Rockefeller.

Margaretta Murphy, the recently
divorced wife of Dr. James Mur-
phy of New York, has just become
the wife of Governor Rockefeller.
The shouts of, “It must be Craw-
ford” changed to “Murphy” and now
there are no shouts.

From a political point of view, this
writer feels that Rockefeller’s recent
marriage will affect his popularity
very little. Americans have a tran-

 

 

in 64?

sient mentality which will, in time
allow most of those persons wh
were morally stung by his divore
and re-marriage to look upon Happ

Thinclads 4th

By TOM CARPENTER |
Maybe the Washington and Lee
baseball team should change its
name from the Generals to the Hit-
less Wonders after Saturday’s 5-4
victory over Frederick College of
Portsmouth at W&L.

The Generals scored two runs in
the first without benefit of a hit and
added the three decisive runs in the
second on a longe single by fresh-
man sensation Eric Sisler, whose hit
did not even drive in a run.

Chris Wigert, the personable lefty,
went the distance to gain his fourth
win agains one defeat. Wigert tossed
a five-hitter and allowed only one
earned run. He had some control
problems, though, walking eight.

The Generals took advantage of
losing pitcher Dave Walton’s first in-
ning wildness to pick up the first
two runs. Walton walked four of
the first five hitters with Howie
Martin getting the one with the
sacks loaded to force Sisler across
the plate. Chuck Lane scored the
second run on Lou Paterno’s infield

In State Meet

By DON CASTO

Defending champion William and
Mary successfully maintained its
title as the best track team in Vir-
ginia last Saturday in the state meet.
The heavily-favored Indians racked
up seventy-one points to second
place VMI’s forty-seven. The Uni-
versity of Virginia was third with
twenty-five points; and Washington
and Lee’s cindermen placed a close
fourth, scoring twenty-three points.

Jumper Robin Kell captured the
only first place in the varsity events
for the Generals. He jumped forty-
three feet, nine inches to become
state champion in the triple jump.

Skip Essex was edged out at the
finish line in the 440-yard dash in
an exciting race. The winning time
was forty-nine seconds flat, and
Skip had a time of forty-nine and
two tenths seconds.

Sprinter Kit Kell, who has been
plagued by a serious leg injury all

hundred yard dash to everyone’s
surprise. Hurlder John Pearson took

the conference’s four spring sports—

baseball, golf, tennis, and track and ®

Washington University’s “Battling
Bears”—the conference's largest
member—will bring unusually
strong teams in tennis, golf and
track to Lexington. The Bears, who
won the league basketball trophy
at Sewanee in February, rate as fav-
orites in the quest for the Presi-
dents’ Trophy—a 300-pound loco-
motive bell which is the symbol of
the year-old conference.

Two unusual features will mark
the festival:

There will be a strong emphasis
on good will and friendly associa-

Baseball Team Defeated By Eagles

(Continued from page 3)

The other big threat by Frederick |
in the eighth was terminated when,
with runners on second and third,
Dick Brown made a great running
catch of a line shot by Bonnie Stev-
enson for the third out.

Walton held the Generals to three
hits, two by Sisler and an infield
single by Paterno.

Yesterday the Generals invaded
Bridgewater and came out on the
short end of a 13-10 score when the
Eagles scored six runs in the eighth.
Wigert lost in relief.

W&L scored four in the first on a
combination of three walks, a sac-
rifice fly by Martin, a single by
Buck Rose, and a double by Lane.

The winners retaliated with four
in their half of the frame on three
walks and a grandslam homer by
Jim Benson off starter Paterno, who
was removed in the third because
of control trouble in favor of Mason |
MeGowin.

In the fourth W&L moved back ,
into the lead on a walk to Rose!
and singles by Pete Candler, Me-
Gowin, and Sisler.

Bridgewater came back with three
unearned runs in the fifth on three
singles, two wild pitches, and an
error, but the Generals regained the
lead in the sixth with two runs.
Rose and Candler singled and Mc-
Gowin sacrificed. Sisler drove in
Rose with a sacrifice fly, and Cand-
ler scored on an error on Allen’s
grounder. It looked over in the sev-
enth when W&L added two more
on a walk to Lane, a bunt single by
Lou Flanagan, a sacrifice fly by Bob
Taylor, and a single by Rose, but
the Eagles were not through.

McGowin walked the first batter
and then yielded a single to winning
pitcher George Funkhouser, who
ended up on third on two errors.
Another single brought in Funk-
houser to make it 10-9. A stolen base
and a fly ball put the tying run on
third. The tiring McGowin was re-
moved in favor of Wigert, who
tossed a wild pitch to let the tying
run score. Wigert walked the first
men he faced and yielded a triple
to Yager Marks, who scored on a
passed ball. He retured the next
hitter ,but was tagged for a round-
tripper by Carlton Cox to make it

get the last out.

Sisler, Rose, and Candler were the
big hitters for the Generals. Sisler,
who is the team leader in batting
with a .452 mark, went three-for-
three with a double, a sacrifice fly,
