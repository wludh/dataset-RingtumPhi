OPENS TONIGHT

Ball Begins
At Nine

By GARETH ADEN
Executive Editor

“The South’s most out-
stand collegiate social event,”
better known as Washington
and Lee’s Fancy Dress Week-
end, officially opens this after-
noon for the fifty-fourth time
since its beginning in 1907.

Count Basie, internationally
known band leader and his 17-
piece orchestra will play for the
Fancy Dress Ball tonight. Around
midnight Stan Rubin with his clar-
inet and his renowned Tiger Town
Five will take over for a Dixieland

“Jam_ session.”

The concert Saturday night will
feature Nina Simone, jazz pianist
and singer, whose record, “I Love
You Porgy,” started her popular
singing career and has kept her
in the national spotlight for sever-
al years. Miss Simone has been
classified as one of the “most excit-
ing entertainers” currently on the
night club circuit.

The Faney Dress Weekend, run-
ning from February Ist to 3rd, will
begin this afternoon with a “Play-
boy Theme” cocktail party. The
party is given by Phi Kappa Sigma
in honor of Ham Emory, President of
the 1963 Fancy Dress at the May-
flower Motor Inn from 4:00-6:00.

The ball this evening will be held
in Evans Dining Hall and will com-
memorate the Civil War Centennial.
From all indications the costume
sales were the most successful in
years, and it appears that the floor
will be crowded with many couples
dancing to the “big band” sounds of
Count Basie.

Basie came into musical fame
around 1939 when he made his first
Decca recordings and his first ap-
pearance at Carnegie Hall. “One
O’clock Jump,” one of his first re-
cordings, is probably his best known
release. During the ‘Forties’ Basie
continued to put out top releases
and even broke into the movie in-
dustry in the picture Reveille with
Beverly.

After several years with a small
jazz combo, Basie was back with his
band in 1951. By 1954 he was named
“top jazz band” in Down Beat's
critics’ poll. That same year Count
Basie and his group made their
first European tour which proved
to be a spectacular success. He is
still in demand in all parts of the
continent.

Stan Rubin and his Tiger Town
Five, who will play for the jam ses-
sion after the ball, are of no less
national or international fame. Ru-

Welcome

The Ring-tum Phi staffs wish to welcome everyone to this,
the 54th annual Fancy Dress Ball. We are glad you could come,
and we hope you have an enjoyable weekend.

The University is especiall

y proud of Fancy Dress for its

role in putting W&L on the collegiate map. At various times
in its history the Ball has been broadcast by two radio networks,

and covered by two magazines

. The New York Times gave it

the name it proudly bears; ‘The South’s outstanding collegiate

social event.”

Fancy Dress weekend is a magnet for friends, alumni, and

students; girls from all over th

e country and our friends from

Harvard, UNC, neighboring VMI, the University of Florida,

and many other schools. It is as big an attraction as Homecom-

ing or a Mock Convention.

Fancy Dress President Ham Emory and Dance Board Pres-
ident Frank Young deserves praise for the imagination, creativi-

ty, and time they have put into
we cite the plans for the figure

this year’s Ball. As one example,
quoted in Young’s column else-

where on this page. Our thanks also go to Emory’s vice-presi-
dents and the Dance Board Advisory Council.

So we welcome you, wherever you're from. We’re escaping
the mid-winter boredom and the horror of exams, as you well
may be. This year’s Fancy Dress Ball promises to be the best
way we've ever had of doing so.

 

Should Cocktail Parties
Be Sponsored By Classes?

By PETE ALFORD
Friday Columnist

“Whatever be thy fate today,
Remember, this too shall pass
away.” —old proverb

It seems inappropriate to interject a
quasi-serious note at this time of
ee revelry and mer-
iv % - ry-making, but we

Dee oe feel a suggestion
Ss coming on and
' must get it into

print before it

fades .

Actually we
don’t possess an
original idea but
4 rather would like
to add to some-
thing already said.
It was suggested
edtorially in the Ring-tum Phi sev-
eral weeks ago that the cocktail
parties for Openings, Springs and
Finals weekends be financed by an
entire academic class since the Pres-
idents of these dance sets starting
next year will be the presidents of
the respective classes.

We feel this a sound suggestion
for two obvious reasons. First, it
will give the class officers some-
thing to do and secondly it will
ease the financial burden on the
individual houses who, under the
present plan, have had to assess their
members heavily to pay for one of
these parties.

Through EC

Of course now comes the problem
of through what channels this wor-
thy plan of the Ring-tum Phi (or
whoever first thought of it) must
proceed. It would seem that the EC
would have final word since three
entire classes would be affected
financially by the new plan.

We would like to take this op-
portunity to present something in
connection with Fancy Dress, the

  

Alford

annual debauchery we are celebrat-
ing now. I feel that for several rea-
sons the President of Fancy Dress
should be the President of the LF.C.:
this would give more prestige(?) to
the council, and possibly the F.D.
weekend cocktail party costs could
be shared equally by all fraternities
and top-rate entertainment would
be afforded.

Need for Crisis

Crisis Department. Looking back
over this first semester from a
“yellow” journalistic point of view,
we see nothing comparable with last
year’s Martin Luther King episode.
We hope this new semester will pro-
vide our readers with some hot is-
sues.

Those of you who are still with
me must be hiding from your date’s

behind the Ring-tum Phi. It can’t
be that bad. Go out and have a
good time. Remember, classes on
Monday!

South’s Best Parties
In 5 Decades Of FD

By KEN LANE
Assistant Managing Editor

Fancy Dress has come a long way
since it was introduced at Washing-
ton and Lee 56 years ago. In fact,
the 1907 crowd of 20 couples has
been increased to more than 1200
couples (the expected turnout this
year) and the cost of the dance
weekend has spiralled from $44 to

$8,000.

In 1907 Annie Jo White, presi-
dent of the Dramatic Club, pre-
sented the “Ball Masque” as a
reward for the successful actors
in the group. More than half of
those attending the dance were
first-classmen at VMI and a slend-
er crowd of 40 danced in the old
gymnasium, on the site of the
present chemistry building. The
$44 cost was paid by Dramatic
Club profits.

$8,000

Today W&L launches an $8,000
extravanganza. Stan Rubin and the
Tiger Town Five, and Count Basie
and his 17-piece orchestra will tally
up a total expense of $5,000 while
$2,500 will be paid to the Nina
Simone group. The costumes will
cost an additional $750; and the dec-
orations and ever-present “miscel-
laneous” will cost still another $450.
Dance Board President Frank Young
expects over 2,500 to attend the first
night.

Fancy Dress has had an interest-
ing history—a history which has
included every theme imaginable
and most of the nation’s big-name
bands. There have been constant
changes in the organization and
method of presentation.

 

The California Ramblers?

For instance, it wasn’t until 1929
that a student president of the danc-
ing set directed the affair. In that
year the California Ramblers en-
tertained the partying gentlemen.
They came from exotic, far-off
Farmville, Va.

But in later years, the orchestras
of some more popular groups jour-

neyed to Lexington. In 1936 Profes- |’

sor Kay Keyser of the Kollege of
Musical Knowledge arrived. He was
followed by Eddie Duchin, Hal
Kemp, Benny Goodman and Woody

Herman. In more recent years we've |

danced to the Dorsey Brothers and
Les Elgart.
National Publicity
Publicity-wise, Fancy Dress has
attained national notice on several
occasions and, finally has been titled
what the vice-president for publicity

| perennially calls “The South’s Out-
| standing College Social Event.” In

 

| 1932 Walter Winchell came to FD

from Broadway and introduced the
dance set to the nation in a special
radio broadcast. And almost every
year, until several years ago, Roa-
noke radio and television stations
rebroadcast tapes and films of the
ball.

Fancy Dress has indeed had a long
and colorful history, but there are
still anomalies about its origins.
Some say that Annie Jo White was a
librarian here in 1907 and that the
ball started, not in the old gym-
nasium, but in a room above what is
now McCrums, at a party Miss White
gave for her friends. But regardless
of how it started, Fancy Dress has
changed in ever manner, to become
the most talked-about social event
among the colleges of the South.

 

Weekend For Some
Is A Social Disaster

By SANDY FENN
Friday Columnist

For some it was the leading col-
legiate social event in the South,
but for me it was
just another social
disaster. You see,
I had this perfect-
_ ly wild and gor-
s geous date coming
in from the North
and all. I had giv-
en her the big
pitch one night
when I was slight-
ly ripped, and had
allowed as how
Fancy Dress was
the greatest small college weekend
any girl could ever hope to attend.
Boy, that brought her ears up just
like a blasted Doberman Pinscher,
because she really was a bit of a
social climber. In fact, if you looked
at it perfectly objectively you’d have
to admit she could outclimb one of
these skinny little natives out in the
Pacific who scurry up palm trees to
shake out coconuts and stuff like
that.

Anyway, she was supposed to call
me Friday afternoon and tell me
how the devil she was getting from
Washington to Lexington so I could
meet her. Well, I sat there all af-
ternoon waiting for her to call or
something, but she didn’t. All I could
think of was that I was missing the
cocktail party with the Brothers
Four and drinking sours. By the
time she finally did call at 6 o'clock

Fenn

I was sure missing the sours and the |!
lot more| >

Brothers Four a whole
than I was missing her, I ean tell
you.
The Fun Begins

Well, I asked her where the duce
she was hiding herself, and she
said she was in Lexington at the
hound station. Can you beat that?
She takes the foarming grey dog
from Washington to Lexington and
never even lets me know it. Cripes,
the whiskey sours I could’ve had
while she was on that thing.

Anyway, I tried to play it cool

and all and didn’t bother to men-
tion just how much I hated her at
that moment. Instead I told her

“gosh, wasn’t it awful for her to
ride the bus,’ and “wow, wasn’t it
wonderful that she was finally here,”
which it wasn’t. Then I went to get
her.

Actually when I saw her, I felt
pretty glad I had asked her after
all, because she really did look fine
standing there in front of the hound
station. It didn’t occur to me right
then that Whistler’s Mother would
probably look great too, standing
in front of that backdrop, but that’s
beside the point. Anyhow, I told
her she looked great and all in that
dress. She told me that was swell,
because her bag hadn’t come and I

 

 

might be seeing quite a bit of her
that weekend in it. What’s a guy
supposed to do?

And Continues

Well, later on that night she went
to put on her Fancy Dress costume.
and I got the surprise of my life.
Not only was it the wrong costume,
it was also the wrong size. The
theme was “Shakespeare Rides
Again” or something, and we were
supposed to go as Venetians. You
know, long velvet robes and all that
stuff. Well, there I am in my velvet
robes and she comes out as a snazzy
Cleopatra with an outfit about thirty
sizes too small, only she didn’t know
it.

That was the only thing that made
me go to the dance. I mean, I felt
like a pretty big fool in my robes
and all when she was Cleopatra. But
she looked like the Playmate of

Unusual Figure

The figure for this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball will add a new concept
to W&L dances. Following their
introductions, FD President Ham
Emory, his vice-presidents, and the
fraternity presidents will form the
Confederate flag and the flag of the
United States. Colored crepe paper
will be utilized for these formations.
Following the figure there will be
a brief intermission, after which
dancing will begin.

Count Basie’s internationally fa-
mous 17-piece orchestra will supply
the music for tonight’s ball. Basie
will alternate with the Dixieland
contingent of Stan Rubin. The two
groups will offer a variety of dance
music unitl approximately 11:30

SCENE of the festivities during last year’s Fancy Dress

Ball in Evans Dining Hall.

Mayflower Manager Cites
Cocktail Party Episodes

By HARRY MEEM
Friday Reporter

John Spanburgh, the manager of
the dining room at the Mayflower
Motor Inn, will be a busy man this
afternoon.

It’s not that he expects to do a
booming business in complete din-
ners, hors d’oeuvres, appetizers and
so forth to cater to the diversified
appetites of the assorted crowd of
dates, Wahoos, and other such visi-
tors to Fancy Dress. Spanburgh has
been busy all day, and will be busy
into the night, setting up and clean-
ing up after the cocktail party.

He’s been doing this for eight
years, two or three cocktail parties
a year. In the course of this time,
as the man in the middle, he’s
had to put up with assorted guff
from various and sundry groups.
For instance:

He usually gets a few complaints
per party from some of the town’s
upright citizenry who abhor the
sight of students and/or dates stag-
gering down the sidewalks and
throwing up in driveways. The
citizens want to know what sort of
nefarious den of iniquity he’s run-
ning, letting America’s clean-living
youth get drunk. And some of the
students like to complain about the
weak drinks (which by the way is
a matter of policy to which we'll
return).There’s occasional trouble
with the entertainers too.

There was one group. which
had two managers working ahead
of them by a few hours, Span-
burgh got a tip from a student
that the advance men waited for
the crowd to gather, then rifled
through coats. So rather than go
back upstairs after the party start-
ed, he took up a position by the
coat room and waited.

“One of them (the managers) came
up to me and told me a fellow
wanted me upstairs,” he went on. “I
told him to tell this fellow if he
wanted me he could come down to
talk to me. The guy went away,
but came back a little later and said
I was wanted upstairs on the phone.
I said to tell them to call back later.
They gave up after that.”

Just prior to one dance weekend,
the Pine Room had been used for
a dinner at which the governors of
Virginia and Maryland were present.
The room was then set up to feed a
well-known Negro piano player and

his orchestra. The leader came in

drunk.

“He gave me a hard time about
eating in the basement,’ Span-
burgh continued. “Told me ‘that
practice went out years ago’ and
that he wasn’t going to eat there.
He wanted to eat in the main
dining room.

“T got fed up with this business.
‘Look,’ I told him, ‘we had two
governors there last night. If
they’re not any better than a second-
rate piano player like you, I give
up.

The biggest crowd ever drawn
to a Pine Room cocktail party was
2,600 to hear the Kingston Trio
several years ago. The Brothers four
drew 2,200. The average crowd for
a Fancy Dress party ranges upward
from 1,800, depending on the at-
traction. The crowd for Openings
is about 800, for Springs 1,400.

For the most part, Spanburgh has
no trouble with W&L students. “My
main worry,’ he added, “is the
crowd they attract from other
schools.” There’s an _ occasional
broken window, and last spring
there was the case of the broken
door. Three students crashed into it
and tore it off the hinges to get a
coat. Spanburgh hasn’t been paid
for the damage yet.

Spanburgh buys the mixers for
the parties at cost. The alcohol is
delivered Thursday night or Friday
morning, an average of 160 fifths.
It’s usually gone by 5:45.

Spanburgh hires the bartenders,
and instructs them to start mixing
the drinks at the rate of a pony of
liquor per drink, cutting back the
alcohol rate as the party gets
oiled. The liquor lasts longer, and
the affair is quieter that way.

The police? Not much of a bother,
aside from cars parked at all con-
ceivable angles. “There was one
party,” Spanburgh recalled, “where
one of them came up to me and
asked ‘Where's the driver of 433-
332?’ or some such number. That
was the time we had 2,600 for the
Kingston trio. I just told him ‘In
there’ and wished him luck.”

At one party several years ago
the sponsoring fraternity was serv-
ing whiskey sours mixed in 10-
gallon erocks. About 5:15, the sup-
ply was almost gone, and what was
left in two of the crocks was “the

the Month or something terrible like
that, and it nearly killed me. How-
ever, after about an hour of danc-
ing around, she announced that her
costume was strangling her. Well,
I couldn’t try to argue that with
her, because it was pretty obvious
not only that it was strangling her
but also where it was strangling
her. So we left, and went back to
try to borrow some clothes to go to
the combo party in .

That effort pretty successfully fin-
ished the wekend for both of us,
because there wasn’t anyone around
who was quite her size. And after

seeing her in that Cleopatra outfit
I could easily understand how such
a thing could be possible. Anyway,
she spent the rest of that night,
and most of the next day, sulking
around in her room and calling me
every two and half seconds to find
out where her bag was. Cripes, you’d
have thought I was hiding it from
her or something.

Be Prepared
Finally Saturday afternoon she
got real good and mad, walked

right down to the hound station in

her one fine dress, and took the
bus back to Washington. Some
weekend, man was it ever great.

Still, I couldnt’ really blame her for
not wanting to go around all week-
end in the same dress. Therefore,
just to show her I have no hard feel-
ings after all this time, I’ve invited
her down to Fancy Dress again.
And if the same thing should hap-
pen twice, at least I'll be prepared.
She dosen’t know it yet, but I sent
off and, in keeping with this year’s
theme, ordered seven different bunny
outfits for her—each about thirty
sizes too small.

p.m., at which time a “New Orleans |
Dixieland Jam Session” is scheduled.
The jam session, a new idea this
year, is an attempt to liven up the
late hours of the dance.

The decorations and costuming of
tonight’s ball should make it one of
the most colorful in W&L’s history.
The costumes will range from north-
ern and southern Civil War uniforms
to “Rhett Butler” and diplomatic
attire. Flags, platforms, and columns
will be placed through the hall to
enhance the effect.

Rumors Not True
I hasten to add that, contrary to
rumor, the Dance Board has no
plans to “borrow” one of VMI’s can-
nons to be used for decor.
Doremus Gymnasium will be the
setting for tomorrow night’s concert,

which will feature Nina Simone’s
jazz quartet. Saturday’s concert will
last from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. The
gymnasium will be decorated in ac-
cord with the Playboy theme of this
afternoon’s cocktail party. Four
hundred balloons will be hung from
the ceiling to add to this effect.
Washington and Lee’s Fancy Dress
Weekend has traditionally been one
of the outstanding social events in
the south. Tonight’s dance coupled
with tomorrow's concert should
make one of the most successful in
many years.

bin’s group organized at Princeton
University in 1954. They became
popular so quickly that the next year
they took a “once in a lifetime” trip
to Europe. There they blasted roy-
alty and played for some of Elsa
Maxwell’s famous parties on the
French Riviera.

Since then “The Five” have been
featured at Newport, the Grace
Kelley-Prince Ranier wedding, the
Cindrella Ball in Pittsburgh, and
countless other public and private
events. There is no time set for the
jam session.

From 8:0 Oto 10:00 Saturday night,
Nina Simone will entertain for the
concert. In coming to W&lL she will
be taking a break in her usual
busy schedule which includes such
well-known clubs as the Blue Note
in Chicago, the Casino Royal in
Washington, and the Round Table,
the Village Gate, and Carnegie Hall
in New York.

foulest looking and smelling stuff
I've ever seen,” Spanburgh said.

“We had to do something. The
fellow in charge of the party was
sick, running out so soon. We finally
sent a boy up to the kitchen to get
the iced tea we had prepared for
supper, and mixed it with the re-
mains of the whiskey sours.

“There was a lot of lemon in the
mix, and just enough alcohol to be
tasted. So we sent it on out to be
served. They didn’t know the dif-
ference. Claimed it was the best
drink they’d ever tasted.”
