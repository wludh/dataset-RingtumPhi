Study Plan

Announced

Princeton University has estab-
lished a Cooperative Undergraduate
Program for Critical Languages. The
new program, supported by a grant
from Carnegie Corporation of New
York, will make available to under-
graduates of certain other institu-
tions, including Washington and Lee,
Prineeton’s resources for instruc-
tion in Arabic, Chinese, Japanese,
Persian, Russian and Turkish lan-
guages and related regional studies
in the social sciences.

Admission to Princeton

In the program, undergraduates
from certain other institutions will
be admitted to Princeton at the end
of their sophomore year for a year
of instruction in the critical lan-
guages and related regional studies
and will return to their own college
as seniors to complete their under-
graduate education.

There are two requirements for |
admission to the Program: a distin-
euished college academic record and
one year of the critical language to
be studied. The second requirement |
may be met by an intensive summer
course. A number of summer schol- !
arships available. While at
Princeton, undergraduates taking |
part in the program are eligible for |
financial aid, on the basis of need. |

Many Colleges Included

 

are

Dean Pusey stated that our facul-
ty had approved the cooperation of
Washington and Lee in this new pro-
gram. Participating colleges also}
include Carelton, Hamilton, Haver-
ford, Kenyon, Lawrence, Oberlin,
and Swarthmore Colleges. Wash-
ington and Lee is the only institu-
tion from the South so far invited
to take part in the plan.

Most liberal arts colleges not as-
sociated with major graduate schools
unable to offer instruction in
most of these languages. The Prince- |
ton Program will provide a wholly
new opportunity for such  partici- |
pation.

Any interested and qualified stu-
dents should consult Dean Pusey at
once. May 1 is the deadline for ap-
plication to Princeton.

Importance Of EC Experience

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor
About 75 students listened last
night in duPont Auditorium to six
brief speeches made by the candi-
dates for Executive posts. The
speeches themselves lasted for one-
half an hour, and for the following
hour a question and answer session

was held.

from the Progressive Party, led off
the speeches by addressing himself

to his opponent’s two year’s exper-
ience on the EC. “Experience

Tom Supak, running on the Pro- |

his speech by asking whether a 28-)

opponent could share the same fei |

of W&L that the normal under-
graduate has. Supak charged that

platform. He emphasized this above |

Frank Wright, Progressive candi- |
date for secretary, stated that the |
secretary's office is one demanding
a person who is willing not only to

a person who has a keen sense of
judgment, and to obtain
the truth in every case which comes
before him. He mentioned experi-
ence, as did Noell, and followed up
by saying that “experience is based
upon the ability of the individual
to perceive, to understand, and to
remember.” Thus, he concluded, the
ability inherent in the individual,
not the experience itself, is what is
important.

Last night’s announcement was the

after the breakup of the old parties
and the formation of the Progressive
Party. Non-fraternity students, in
recognizing that the new political
balance on campus would give them

political party Clique meetings.

Independent leaders have stated
that their Union is not merely po-
litical, and that it will also offer
social and athletic opportunities for
non-fraternity students. But their
main purpose is to obtain political
participation for Independent stu-
dents, a goal which was apparently
out of reach under the old political
system dominated by the University
Party.

One Man’s Opinion
When election time at W&L rears its head. the air is filled
with exhortations of one candidate’s experience, another's
ability and so forth on down the line. The only trouble with
such goings on is that often times the people doing the exhort-
ing have very little real connection with or knowledge of the
candidate they’re backing (except, perhaps, through campus

political ties) .

It is for this reason, along with the realization that to
endorse a slate of candidates would constitute merely one man’s
opinion, that the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi will not offer a list of
candidates as its choice for the election on Thursday. Instead
this page has been devoted to letting the opposing candidates

speak for themselves.

So here they are. Make up your own minds.

Spring ... And Elections

Spring elections are different this year. Those students who
habitually cheer for the underdog will miss the old Independent
Party, which died long ago but was only recently interred.
Those who like a perpetual winner will be concerned to behold
the University Party involved in a real campaign for the first

time, perhaps, in decades.

In the past, the spring script called for: madras jackets, ber-
muda shorts, a frantic search for candidates by the Indepen-
dent Party, a frantic campaign against the one-party system . . .
and a virtual sweep by the Big Clique Gravy Train. This year
only the costumes are the same, and it’s not without a touch
nostalgia, perhaps even a tear, that the perceptive upperclass-
man notices how holied political tradition has been rudely

disrupted.

The Big Clique has been trimmed down to nine houses,
the same size as the new Progressive Party. The non-fraternity
students have demanded a voice in the campaign—and they’ re
organized this year. Since neither party owns a definite ma-
jority, it appears that the campaign may be decided on issues,
which might, of course, force an uncomfortable situation on
some of the old party leaders. On the other hand, it might pro-
voke some intelligent interest among the voters, which could

be the biggest change of all.

 

 

 

Frank Wright
Progressive Party Candidate
Running for Secretary

Juniors Croft And Wright
Vie for Secretarial Post

In my estimation the office of
Seeretary of the Student Body is one
which requires much responsibility
from the person who holds it. In
the administration of the Honor
System, the secretary, like all other
members of the Executive Commit-
tee, bears the dual responsiblity of
protecting the individual involved
as well as seeing that the spirit of
honor on the Washington and Lee
campus is maintained. For this rea-
son he must approach each honor
trial with a keen sense of judgment
and a desire of obtaining the truth.
With respect to the administrative
duties of the secretary, he must be
willing to devote his time and his
efforts to insure that all matters of
a clerical nature are conducted
promptly and thoroughly. The sec-
retary must also assist the presi-
dent in any way he can, and as a
chosen representative of the student
bedy, he has the particular respon-
sibility of keeping that student body
informed of the general proceedings
of the Executive Committee.

This enumeration of the duties of
secretary brings an important fact
to mind. It is evident from the size
and the variety of responsibility that
the secretary must assume that ex-
perience is not the only criterion
upon which one must judge the
competency of a candidate for this
office. Such individual qualities as

Ed Croft
University Party Candidate
Running for Secretary

Gentlemen:

The University Party has honored
me with the nomination for Sec-
retary of the Student Body, a re-
sponsible position for which I am
more than willing to run. When con-
sidering the qualifications of the
candidates, there should be three
primary areas of attention: exper-
ience, ability, and the willingness to
serve the Student Body. Let me now
review my qualifications for you in
light of these considerations.

My freshman year I was elected
the class representative to the Exe-
cutive Committee. Being on the
Committee has given me valuable
experience and a familiarity with
the workings of the system of gov-
ernment, this being a most important
asset which my opponent does not
have.

The ability of the candidate is the
second important area of considera-
tion, My ability has been proven in
all phases of school life, In sports,
I have received varsity letters in
both football and track, I have con-
sistently mainiained above-average
grades and have served as President
of the sophomore class. I was a
Vice-President of last year’s highly
successful Faney Dress Ball and
in charge of the costume sale for
this year’s Civil War Centennial
Ball and Presidents of this year’s
Springs Weekend. For my ability

out first expressing my sincere grat-
itude for two things. The first is my
thanks for the honor and privilege
of serving you as Executive Commit-
teeman for two years. These two
years have taught me a great deal
about student government at Wash-
ington and Lee, and my only hope
is that I have added to that process
just a fraction of what I have learned
from it. The second thing for which
I am thankful is the confidence in
me that you have shown by nomi-
nating me for this most important
office. I accept this nomination with
humility, for I believe I know the
work involved in being President,
and it is therefore with this sense
of gratitude and humility that I
say a few words.

My three years here have brought
me into contact with every facet of
student life. Through these contacts
I have come to know the feelings
of many different students and have
learned their thoughts on student
government. Our platform reflects |
some of these thoughts, but limited |
space prevents me from elaborating |
on these here. However, throughout |
the week I shall be expressing my
views on the various issues at hand
and also the many incidental issues
of the campaign. I firmly believe!
that I know what we as students |
need and desire.

Despite the importance of the exe- |
cutive and legislative functions of |
the Executive Committee, I feel that |
its most crucial function is in its!

 

judicial capacity. This involves the

education of the student body to the
principles of the Honor System, and
its enforcement. It is with personal
knowledge of this grave responsibil-
ity that I offer myself as a candidate
before you, the Student Body of
Washington and Lee. During the
two years that I have served on
the Executive Committee, I have
seen men before that committee on
many occasions. I have been com-
pelled to make decisions about these
men, decisions made only after the
most thorough examinations of all
possible motives as well as facts,
decisions that have resulted in the
dread finality of an Honor System
violation.

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

In the Friday edition of the Ring-
tum Phi, much attention was given
to the fact that my opponent’s ex-
perience on the Executive Commit-
tee constituted proper grounds for
an editorial endorsement of his can-
didacy for President of the Student
Body. But the one question which
the editorial left unanswered in my
mind was simply this: What does
experience mean in and of itself?
Does experience necessarily reflect
judgmental ability? Does experience
necessarily indicate initiative and
perceptiveness? Does experience
necessarily connote a_ significantly
analytical mind? Does experience
necessarily suggest a more funda-
mental understanding and apprecia-
tion of the Honor System? Does ex-
perience necessarily argue logically
for the negation of another individ-
ual’s ability to recognize the spirit
embodied in Honor as a concept? Is
experience necessarily conducive to
the acceptance of new ideas or is it
the crutch on which one leans as a
justification for embracing the past?
Its experience necessarily synono-
mous with capacity for leadership? Is
experience necessarily a recommen-
dation for election, or is it more
nearly a descriptive statistic?

Is not experience more realistical-
ly an argument, which Buck hoped
would be so plausible on its surface,
that its superficiality would go un-
noticed and unquestioned? Is not

' experience the popular myth that

the Boston Transcript exploded as
“a perpetual best seller that every-
body’s continually, unthinkingly, and
unjustifiably buying’? Does not ex-
perience on this campus point more
basically to systems which promote
individual personalities and sus-
tain them in the campus limelight?

The foregoing has been aimed at
suggesting that there is nothing in-
herently magical about anyone’s ex-
perience. Individuals have served
on university committees, but they
have not necessarily been judged
qualified to assume the chairman-
ship; Vice-presidents of the United
States have campaigned unsuccess-
fully for the Presidency, because ex-
perience was weighed on the scales
and was found inadequate in itself as
a qualification for higher office; in
business, chief executives are often
brought into the firm from sources

(Continued on page 4)

 

I would like to take this opportu-
nity to express my appreciation to
the members of the University Party
for your confidence in nominating
me as your party’s candidate for the
office of Vice-President of the Stu-
dent Body. It is a privilege to have
been nominated for such a high po-
sition, and if elected I will do my
utmost to see that I am deserving
of your confidence.

Perhaps the greatest single ques-
tion which has engaged the minds
of this University’s students during
the last week is why do I believe I
should be elected to the office of
Vice-President of the Student Body.
In attempting to answer this ques-
tion I will separate the functions of
this office into two categories and
deal with each separately.

This first category is that of con-
tributing assistance in the formula-
tion of the executive and legislative
powers of the Executive Committee
in matters pertaining to the Student
Body Organization. As I have pre-
viously served in the capacity of
Vice-President of a college student
body, I feel that I have gained a
measure of experience and _ insight
into the intricacies of Student Gov-

| ernment affairs which could be used

to advantage by this student body.
This experience would enable me to
offer suggestions to the President and
other members of the Executive
Committee in the mapping of strat-
egy to be used in the presentation
of matters which vitally concern the
student body to the Administration.
One of the important duties of the
Vice-President is to work with the
other elected officials of the student
body in carrying to the Adminis-
tration the desires of the students. I
have been called upon on numerous
occasions to appear before various
faculty bodies to present Student
Government matters, and feel that
I can draw upon this background of
experience to help this Student Body
attain the goals which it sets for it-
self.

The second category is that of
aiding in the administration of this
University’s Honor System. This
function is the most important single
duty which could ever befall any
student. To sit as judge of another
is never an easy task and should
never be taken lightly. The authori-

USSR and Red China

 

Although I realize the difficulty
of a succinct statement of political
views, I am going to attempt such
a statement in the following para-
graphs.

First, by the way of refutation of
my opponent, I would like to cor-
roborate my own position. I will
attempt to do this with as much ob-
jectivity and avoidance of deroga-
tion as possible; however, I must
warn you that I feel strongly on
this particular point. I cannot honest-
ly feel that a 28 year old freshman
law student who has only been at
Washington and Lee for seven
months is in contact with the rest
of the student body. There must be
a distinct hiatus of interest and
views here, and this is a separa-
tion which the student body can
ill afford.

Admittedly, I have only attended
this University for two years; how-
ever, during those two years I have
participated in student body affairs.
Ostensibly, these two years may not
seem more valuable than the seven
months of my opponent. However,
ask yourself—as a second semester
freshman—would you feel qualified
to run for the vice-presidency of
the student body? I hope that I
have not belabored this point; how-
ever, I sincerely feel that were I
not running for this office my reac-
tion to the University Party’s candi-
date would be the same .

Second, I would like to support
myself in a more positive manner. I
feel quite sure that most students
would like to become vice-president
of this University; I wonder how
many have thought about their
reasons? At any rate, I certainly
have, and I would like to relate
those reasons to you in a general
manner, I feel that if the Pro-
gressive Party is elected something
will be done. I support the tradi-
tions of this University; I am neither
for them for their own sake nor
against them for their own sake.
However, I do feel that within the
limits of these traditions many lib-
eral changes can be wrought. Hap-
pily, the student body is extending
itself in this direction, and by work-
ing in close contact with the faculty
the student-faculty forum would be
quite efficacious in this area. I
honestly feel that much can be ac-

Ideological Conflict—Or Power Struggle?

By BILL NOELL

It cannot be questioned that there
is an immense gap between the gov-
ernments of Communism’s Big Two:
the Soviet Union and Communist
China. Whether one wishes to argue
that the grounds for such a dis-
agreement are ideological, sociolog-
ical, or just nationalistic, one must
first note the fact that this gap
is widening and is certainly getting
no better; consequently the possi-
bilities for the West to benefit from
that schism are fairly great.

Lincoln’s declaration that “A house
divided against itself cannot stand.”
was not a statement, the truth of
which is peculiar to a democratically
oriented nation. Not unaware of that
fact, Russia would be delighted to
settle her differences with China—
but only if Russia can set the terms
of the accord, and vice versa. But
Mr. Khrushchev has cast serious
doubts on the ability of unilateral
decision making in this area, when
he stated, “The matter has an in-
ertia of its own.”

Ideological Conflict

 

which has an ideological basis. Pe-| and volatile, albeit pragmatic world

king has accused Moscow of commit-
ting an almost limitless number of
Marxist Crimes such as “kowtowing”
before “American beancurd tiger,
adventurism, capitulationism, parlia-
mentary cretinism, revisionism, and
reformation.”

On the other hand, Moscow has
replied to Mao’s charges by point-
ing to the vestiges of Communist
unity, alleging that he is doing noth-
ing more than promoting an actual
break between the two nations; if
the Soviet Union has violated Marx-
ist-Leninst tenets, it has done so
only in the interests of advancing
Communist influence in the world.
Hence, the potential danger associat-
ed with China’s actions and protes-
tations are having a far worse ef-
fect on the “good of the cause” than
could any Russian departure from
principle.

Russian Position

It is then the Russian position that
the Chinese are unrealistic, and
that their dogged devotion to prin-
ciple for principle’s sake is indiea-

On the surface, both parties are| tive of a general shortsightedness on
disposed to call the conflict one! their part, in the face of an electric

political situation, which is to be re-
solved in terms of filling stomachs,
not in terms of peddling ideas.

Power Struggle

More realistically, however, the
rift goes deeper than a mere differ-
ence in the interpretation of Marxist-
Leninist ideology. It is first and fore-
most a power struggle between two
intensely nationalistic peoples. Its
immediate implications are evident
in China’s bid for leadership within
the bloc, itself. Such an occur-
rence is not at all unnatural; China
is already a powerful nation, and is
potentially a great one. She has no
intention of being drawn into a
group of Soviet satellites, as Poland,
Hungarq, and Czechoslovakia have
been, and she will continue to agi-
tate for no less than equality with
Russia, as she attempts to up-grade
her economy and to better the lot
of her people,

Alexander Dallin of Columbia
University’s Russian Institute has
stated, “We will now witness com-
petition for the loyalty and support
of the 81 world (Communist) parties.

 

There will be an equally serious

campaign in the uncommitted nations
as at the recent Afro-Asian confer-
ence in Tanganyika, where we saw
the Chinese criticizing the U.S.S.R.
almost as strongly as they were the
US.”

Ethic Disparity

There is also a racial or sociologi-
cal foundation to this widening split.
One does not have to examine Rus-
sian History in any particular depth,
or to study any extended time per-
iods, to discover the anxieties which
the Russians have traditionally ex-
hibited toward the masses from the
East. As the editor of the Russian
newspaper, Izvestia, stated in con-
versation with Western correspon-
dents, “While the nations of Western
Europe were building their cathe-
drals and cities, the Russians were
protecting them from the Chinese
hordes.”

In light of China’s recent ex-
pansionist activities in East-Asia
Tibet, India, South Viet Nam, and
persistent designs on Formosa—the
Russians have justifiable cause to
fear that militant force on their
borders—borders which the Chinese

440 relay Saturday in Colonial

Relays. The Generals finished fourth. (Photo by Darden)

Generals Grab Seventh Place
In 1st Annual Colonial Relays

Sparked by the jumping of Robin
Kell and the running of Wayne
Barnes, Mack Brownlee, Don Casto,
and John Pearson the Washington
and Lee track team rolled to a sev-
enth place finish in the Colonial Re-
lays Saturday at Williamsburg.

In unofficial team standing W&L
earned 15 points, finishing ahead of
Old Dominion College, Mt. Saint
Mary’s, the University of Virginia,
American University, North Carolina
State, and Richmond. William and
Mary walked off with the first Co-
lonial Relays title, piling up 8”%
points. VMI was second, followed
by VPI, West Virginia, Wake For-
est, and Roanoke.

Kell Second

Junior Kell was the high point
man for the Generals with eight.
He finished second to William and
Mary’s Bill Jeffries in the high
jump at 5-10. Jeffries cleared 6-2.

In the hop, step, and jump—Kell’s
best event—the 6-2 junior wound up
second also when VPI’s J. W. Carter
leaped 44-614 on his final jump to
win by a quarter of an inch,

W&L’s best running effort came in
the sprint medley where the Gen-
erals whipped William and Mary and
West Virginia in winning the heat,
but ended up third when Wake For-
est and Virginia galloped home in

Earn Three Fourths

Fourth place finishes in the 440
relay, the distance medley and the
4-mile relay wound up the Generals’
scoring.

Barnes and Casto with 10.7’s each
paced the 440 relay team to a 44.5
clocking.

Everyone looked sharp in the
distance medley. Jim Thompson ran
a 2:02.6 880, Fox Urquhart turned
in a 52.8 440, Lee Johnson had a
3:24.3 three-quarters of a mile, and
Brownlee ran a 4:44.6 mile.

Andy Kilpatrick’s 4:52.6 mile and
Lee Johnson’s 4:55 mile paced the
four-mile relay team.

The Generals’ next relay effort
comes April 27 at Davidson when
they will be out to improve their
second place finish of last year.

Freshman sprinter Don Casto and
jumper Robin Kell paced the win
with two firsts each. Casto roared

The Generals romped to 13 firsts
out of 16 events. The Tigers managed

Gegaris singled, and both men
moved up on a wild pitch. First

catcher Orvis plated two runs with

The Generals came back for four
in their half and were never be-

With one out, centerfielder Pete
Candler singled to right. Chuck
Lane, walked, and cleanup hitter
Lou Flanagan flied out. Howie Mar-
tin singled in Candler, and short-
stop Buck Rose singled to score
Lane, with Martin moving to third.
Rose stole second, with Martin go-
ing home when the Castleton sec-
ond baseman threw wild in an at-
tempt to get him. Dick Brown singled
Rose home to end the W&L scoring.

Castleton got a run back in the
third on right fielder John Notte’s
triple and a sacrifice by third base-

in the top of the fourth when
Menor singled to right and the ball
got by Eric Sisler for a three-base

New Hampshire Smothers
WG&GL Lacrosse Team, 13-9

Jim West fired in five goals for
New Hampshire’s lacrosse team Fri-
day as the Wildcats notched their
fifth victory of the spring by defeat-
ing Washington and Lee, 13-8.

With West collecting two goals in
first period and his other three in
the second quarter against goalie
Butch West, New Hampshire piled
up 8-2 lead at halftime.

Generals Rally

The Wildcats made it 9-2 against
goalie Pete Noonan early in the
third period before W&L belatedly
caught fire and scored four times in
a minute and 35 seconds.

The Generals looked extra sharp
for this short period as they scored,
controlled the faceoff, and scored
again four straight times.

McDaniel Stars

Midfielder John McDaniel was the
star of the assault, collecting two
of the four goals.

One of McDaniel’s scores was a
beautiful fake shot. The little Genertl

other score came on a pass from Bob

New Hampshire Romps

New Hampshire, however, came
back strong after the W&L assault,
and sewed up the game with a three-
goal final period.

Sam Niblett took over where Jim
West left off in the second half,
scoring three of the Wildcats five
second half goals.

McDaniel and junior Randy Woot-

McDaniel had three goals and an
assist while Wootton scored two
goals.

ty of the Executive Committee in
dealing with honor violations is an
awesome power. They have within
their authority the power to dismiss
a student under other than honor-
able conditions. Such an action not
only has an immediate effect upon
a student but can and will have an
everlasting effect. It is for this rea-
son that members of the Executive
Committee must know and fully un-
derstand just what evidence is nec-
essary and sufficient to warrant the
taking of such drastic action. I be-
lieve that in this area of student
affairs experience is a must. There
is no time for experimentation for
each time the Executive Committee
meets to consider an honor violation

everyone was a possibility.

Considerable attention was paid to
the fact of Ogilvie’s experience as
opposed to Noell’s lack of it, and
how much of a factor it should be
in the election. Ogilvie stood on the
idea that experience gives one in-
sight into the problems faced in
properly administering the honor

experience, Noell answered: Grant-

Guess who offered me an executive
position with a leading organization,
where I'll get good pay, further my
education, and enjoy world travel?

 

In this case, nepotism’s a pretty good idea.
But of course you've got to measure up to get

it. To be admitted to Air Force

School, you've got to be a good student with

skills or aptitudes we can use

Air Force OTS is an intensive three-month
course leading to a commission as a second
lieutenant. As an Air Force officer, you'll be a
leader on the Aerospace Team—and be a part
of a vital aspect of our defense effort.
