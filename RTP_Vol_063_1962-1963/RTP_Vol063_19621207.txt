Forensic Union
Takes Issue

On IFC

Wednesday night the
Union held a debate on an issue
that is no doubt one of the most
controversial subjects on our cam-
pus—the I. F. C. The topic of the
debate was—“Resolved: The I. F. C.
Is in Need of a Change.” A vote was
taken before and after the debate
to determine the opinion of the au-
dience.

The first votes showed eleven peo-
ple for the resolution and twenty-
six against. After the discussion a
second count revealed twenty-nine
in favor of a change and fifteen
dissenting. The team for the affir-
mative included Andy Nea and
Whit Fitzpatrick. They debated
against John Pearson and Ed Croft.
Nea led off in a five minute speech
showing why the I. F. C. is weak
and the different areas where it has
failed in its responsibilities.

Forensic

Pearson followed arguing that
though the control of the IL F. C.
is limited in its sphere it has
shown to be more than effective
and should not be changed simply
for the sake of change alone.

Fitzpatrick completed the argu-
ment for the affirmative suggesting
a plan of revision to improve the
]. F. C. In essence the plan con-
sists of two points; one, that the
representatives not be forced to
bring back to each house every topic
under discussion but only the most
important ones. Two, that because
of the lack of experience of the var-
ious representatives, members should
be elected for a term of two years.

Croft concluded the position of the
negative by stating that if the I. F. C.
is viewed on evidence of its past
actions one must conclude that it
is adequately fulfilling its respon-
sibilities and should not be changed.

Each speaker submitted to a ques-
tion and answer period by one of
the opponents designed to clarify
hazy points in the speakers argu-
ment.

The remaining minutes were spent
in a summary by each team empha-
sizing the high points of the debate.
The results of the night’s effort
showed that a large majority of the
audience agreed that there must def-
inately be a change in the I. F. C.

The Forensic Union meets regular- |

ly throughout the school year and
has as the basis of its meetings de-
bates between various members of
the student body on current ques-
tiens.

 

Jazz Concert Lasts

Stan Rubin, his “red hot’ clarinet, and the famed Tiger
Town Five have been signed to play for the Fancy Dress Ball.
Ed Croft, Vice-President of the Dance Board, announced this
week that Rubin and his band would probably play early in the
evening as people come in and then take over near midnight
with a free-wheeling Dixieland ‘‘jam session.”

Croft said that he and the Dance Board were ‘“‘astounded”

| at the record sale of 458 Civil War costumes in only three days.

Croft explained that the third day of costume sales was called
off because the rental firm had run out of costumes; however,
he said there would be another sale held just after the Christ-
mas Holidays.

The Whole Dance Board is reportedly anticipating ‘‘the
best Fancy Dress in years.”

Slated alongside Count Basie, whose signing was an-
nounced earlier this week, Rubin and his Tiger Town Five will
balance out the evening perfectly. Stan and most of his group
began playing together at Princeton, from which the name
Tiger Town Five was taken. He graduated from Princeton in
1955.

That same year they played their first concert in Carnegie
Hall and their Dixieland music was such a smash that since
then, they have returned three times.

Even while at Princeton, Stan took his band on a “once
in a lifetime” trip to Europe. There they toasted royalty and
played for some of Elsa Maxwell’s famous parties on the
French Riviera. They returned to the states where they blasted

From Midnight On

at the wild Newport Jazz Festival, featured among the
greatest in the jazz world.

In 1956 Stan and the ‘‘Five’’ received international acclaim
when they, as a part of his larger orchestra, were invited to be
the only American group playing at the festivities in Monaco
for the Grace Kelly, Prince Rainier wedding.

Since then Stan has been touring the world. He plays at
numerous cotillions, such as the Cinderella Ball in Pittsburgh;
he has entertained at yacht parties for such socialites as Aris-
totle Onassis and Mike Todd; he appears at night clubs, both
in America and on the continent; and he plays for hundreds of
college proms.

Recognized as one of our country’s leading Dixieland
bands, Rubin’s Tiger Town Five could prove to be as sen-
sational as anything that has hit this school in years. And what
is more, the “jam session” after the Fancy Dress Ball has no
time limit.

Count Basie and his 17-piece orchestra will provide the
music for the actual ball. Like Rubin, Basie has appeared at
Carnegie Hall and toured Europe. Both groups were featured
at Newport in 1955 and have been considered among the
country’s top jazz groups for several years.

One thing surprising about Rubin is that he has acquired
than most men twice his age.”” Much of his success lies in the
versatility of his group. Stan can use the Tiger Town Five as a
solo group or, when the occasion warrants, merge it with his
larger orchestra. This “double punch” has created a great de-
mand for Rubin’s music in night clubs around the country.

Many people have become Stan Rubin fans through hear-
ing one or more of his albums. “Ivy League: Jazz Band Ball”’
is probably his most popular release. “Dixieland Bash” and the
recording from his Monaco appearance are also high in the
ratings.

As a prelude to the weekend’s festivities, the Phi Kaps are
throwing a Playboy cocktail party honoring FD President Ham
Emory. To be cast in the atmosphere of the famous Playboy
Club, the party will be highlighted by the sounds of the Del
Vikings.

A contest is now underway to determine the playmates for

tthe occasion: Students are urged to enter their dates in the

competition for this much-prized honor.

Resurrection Of Fancy Dress

This year’s sale of Fancy Dress Costumes has broken all
existing records. In the first two days, 458 costumes were sub-
scribed to by students. This indicates overwhelming interest

and support of this year’s ball.

It is gratifying to note that the student body has shown
this great interest. With the fine entertainment contracted and
the large student support, Fancy Dress can now return to its
former position of prominence. Fancy Dress now has the op-
portunity to regain its position as “the number one collegiate

social event in the South.”

The Dance Board is to be congratulated for its work in
organizing and promoting this year’s ball. Through their ef-
forts, success has been assured. Fancy Dress President Ham
Emory has gone all out to provide the best possible activities for
the weekend. With the continued support and enthusiasm of
the student body, this year’s Fancy Dress can long be remem-
bered as one of the best in its long history.

 

Student And Faculty Consensus
Favors Revision Of Cut System

By KEN LANE
Assistant Managing Editor

In last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi,
John Kirkley presented a proposal
that we liberalize our cut system.
In essence, the change would per-
mit unlimited cuts, except before
and after holidays, to all upperclass-
men having an average of 1.0 or
better. Those with 2.0 or better
would continue to enjoy their pres-
ent privileges. All freshmen and up-
perclassmen with an average be-
low 1.0 would receive one week of
cuts.

Surprisingly enough, many faculty
members have expressed their ap-
proval of such a revision. The ma-
jority of those we interviewed felt
that our student body is now of
such a caliber that it can live up to,

 

Student Racks “Zero For Five”

Well, the other night I went zero-

average in any-
one’s league. Un-
der the circum-
stances it pained
me particularly.

it was the first

happened. I’m not
griping about that.
I've had plenty of
bad nights over

never quite like
this one. It’s not the sort of thing

Where was I: What was I doing?
No, I wasn’t at Sweet Briar, or

When was the last time you

Student Writes On W&XL Integration

By HARRY FOLTZ

Mr. Lowry in last Tuesday’s Ring-
tum Phi suggested that Washington
and Lee integrate and in doing so
said that the issue should “be de-
cided on the basis of responsibility,
rather than on the basis of so-called
practical consequences.” Having
spent five years at W&L as an un-
dergraduate and a law student and
since I am also a Southerner from
the state that produced the Little
Rock crisis, perhaps I can point out
a few practical consequences of
W&L integrating, and also add an
opinion of my own on the subject.

W&L

The Negro admitted to W&L
would find, as does James Meredith
at Mississippi, that he would be
shunned by the students socially.
He would not be welcome at the
fraternity parties, would certainly
not be asked to join a fraternity,
and the prospect of asking him to
go down the road would be almost
unthinkable. In short, he would find
that his participation in the life of
W&L would be sharply limited to
the academic side, with almost com-
plete exclusion from the social side.

Any Negro who came to W&L
expecting more would be almost
incredibly naive. We are all crea-
tures of our environment to a
certain extent, and that environ-
ment has taught all of us South-
erners and probably a majority of
the Notherners that Negroes are

not acceptable socially. Although
I realize that this attitude is in
theory at least, unjustifiable, I
nevertheless accept it in practice.
I would find it almost impossible
to accept a Negro as my close
friend, and certainly would never
dream of dating one. Environment
from the time we were born has
made the great majority of us
feel this way, even if some of us
realize that there is lack of reason
in such an attitude.

Notwithstanding this prevailing at-
titude and the consequences that
it means for the Negroes involved,
however, should W&L still inte-
grate? I say definitely, yes.

Environment

The reason I say this is because
I see no reason to deny one an edu-
cation, just because we will deny
him social privileges while he gets
that education. Environment may
make us deny the Negro social
provileges, but it certainly does not
make us deny him an education.

I think all of us can learn to
sit beside a Negro in class, in the
commons, and live in the same
dormitory with him, Even though
I do not prefer to do these things,
I certainly think I could bring my-
self to do them when I consider
that by making such a small sac-
rifice of unreasonable prejudice
that I am allowing one to get a
first rate education, that I am fol-
lowing the spirit of Atlanta rather
than of Mississippi, and that I am
helping Washington and Lee dem-
onstrate that it is an_ institution
that recognizes that education
should not be denied on the basis
of race.

Spirit of Atlanta

The spirit of Atlanta which has
received acclaim and respect all over
the country is not one which in-
vites the Negro to that city’s social
functions, but is simply one that
invites him to use the best educa-
tional facilities available in order
that he may lift himself up so that
someday he truly will be equal and
race prejudice will be completely
without foundation. Surely to adopt
that spirit is not too much to ask of
the students, the faculty, and the
trustees of one of the South’s great-
est universities.

 

ated five of the nine short stories I
had hoped to read. I assumed that
was about par for the course, but the
worst was yet to come.

We do have a file on Collier's. Un-
fortunately, it is a bit incomplete...
so incomplete, in fact, that I couldn’t
find even one of the remaining four
stories that I had hoped to stumble
across. Disappointed but not yet de-
feated I forgot what Salinger had
written, and I trundled off in pursuit
of an article about Salinger in Life.
This was the fifth time I had sought
out this particular article. It fic-
titiously resides in a bound volume
of Life that is not supposed to ever
leave the browsing room. Five dif-
ferent times I have looked for this
volume at all hours of the morning,
afternoon, and night. I don’t think
it exists. Never have I found that
volume in the browsing room or
elsewhere in our library.

Broken now but still unbowed

I went downstairs to search out
specific issues of both Newsweek
and Time. Thirty minutes and
some two hundred and seventy-
odd copies of Time and Newsweek
later, I stood in our dusty stacks
perplexed and utterly befuddled.
My hands were black with print-
er’s ink, my back ached, my brain
was numb, and I knew I was
licked. Quietly I gathered my
books and stumped off into the
black, surrounding night.

Oh, I could continue my search,
but with an average like that I had
better quit before I discover some-
thing that will prove my suspicion
that J. D. Salinger, all his works,
and everything written about him,
are the products of a ghost writer
who haunts the Cyrus McCormick
Library’s stacks.

    

and profit by, the added responsi-
bility. There would, of course, be
that small minority of students who
would take undue advantage of
such freedom, but, as one professor
rather philosophically remarked,
“you can’t deny the validity of a
system merely because some will
abuse it.”

Psychological Advantages

Some teachers are considering the
psychological advantages which a
more liberal system offers. The fact
that the student may choose whether
or not to attend a lecture would
erase any negative attitudes which
might result from being a “captive”
audience. More interest and spon-
taneity might be aroused if the
student attends classes on his own
volition.

There was a definite feeling that
the cut system should be revised
for freshmen. The one cut per class
during the first semester is felt
by most teachers to be too re-
strictive.

Some teachers felt that Kirkley’s
plan was too liberal and there was
need for a compromise. There was
the suggestion that a 1.4 average
should be maintained for unlimited
cuts instead of the proposed 1.0. This
would motivate students to strive
beyond the “gentleman’s C” aver-
age. Another suggestion was the pos-
sibility of letting the individual pro-
fessor decide whether to permit un-
limited cuts in his classes.

liberalized cut system maintain that
W&L students on the whole are not
mature or responsible enough to
handle so great a freedom. Having
unlimited cuts would just create
more leisure time for the students
and would have the result of relax-
ing our academic atmosphere.

The opponents of the revision plan
support their argument by referring
to a similar plan instituted several
years ago. The plan provided a
gradual granting of unlimited cuts,
starting with the senior class. The
new privileges were almost fatal to
the seniors. Grades were so low by
the end of the semester that the
plan had to be abandoned. As an-
other example, one profsessor ob-
served that at Harvard, one of the
schools having unlimited cuts, 25
per cent of the students fail out
without attaining their degrees.
“Can we really fool ourselves,” asked
one professor, “into thinking that
the average student is going to study
harder and do more independent
work if given unlimited cuts?”

Another teacher argued that the
requirement of a 2.0 for unlimited
cuts only serves as an incentive to
the student to live up to what he
can do. “Considering the high aca-
demic average and College Board
scores needed for entrance here,”
remarked one professor, “there is
not a student at Washington and Lee
who can’t get a 2.0 if he works for

Student Opinion

Student opinion appears to be al-
most unanimously in favor of the
proposed revision.. In general, they

attend the Euphorians’ schools,
which were called “Pursuit of Hap-
piness” schools, after an ancient
theory. There they were taught

principally to get along happily with
other Euphorians. A certain amount
of learning was required of them, so
they could advance to the level of
the popular college, where the smiles
were brighter, the cars faster and
the happiness possibilities almost
without limit.

When they grew older, the Eu-
phorians gave up learning for earn-
ing. Earning was a sure path to hap-
piness. The fast return had once
performed its alchemies with magic
swiftness. Better now was the slow,
sure return, with fringe benefits.
The comfort and security thus
gained made all things possible for

Chapel Restoration On Schedule;
Re-Opening Expected In June

Work on the restoration of his-
toric Lee Chapel on the Washington
and Lee University campus appears
to be on schedule.

The $370,000 project, begun early
in June, is being done by work
crews from the John J. Pettyjohn
Company of Lynchburg. All funds
for the undertaking were made
available to Washington and Lee last
year by the Ford Motor Company
Fund of Dearborn, Mich., to “help
preserve one of the South’s most
prized landmarks.”

Plans call for the restored Chapel
to be re-opened in appropriate cere-
monies in June before the close of
Washington and Lee’s 1962-63 aca-
demic year.

units—has been installed.

Steel Beams

The installation of steel beams in
the nearly 100-year-old structure’s
roof was finished several weeks ago.
The beams replace solid wooden
ones that have supported the brick
Chapel’s roof since it was built in
1867. The slate that was removed
from the original roof will be put
back in place.

Steel floor beams also have been

put in place and a concrete sub-
flooring has been poured. The
wooden flooring in the Chapel was
removed for refinishing and will
be put back down as the restora-
tion work progresses. The Chapel’s
original wooden pews are being
refinished and will be kept in stor-
age until Spring.

Construction officials report that
the brick walls of the Chapel are
sound and no “major work” will be
necessary.

Although emphasis in the Chap-
el project is on restoration, plans
call for extensive improvements
which will assure the future pres-

Experts

Restoration experts have recom-
mended certain changes in the dis-
| play of art work, museum items and
the recumbent statue of General
| Robert E. Lee. The changes are de-
| signed to enhance the Chapel’s ap-
| peal to the 30,000 persons who visit
it annually. Workmen currently are
| concentrating their work in the
; basement museum area. The famous

 

Valentine recumbent statue of Lee,
although not removed from the
Chapel, is enclosed by a protective
wooden box.

Perry, Hepburn, Shaw and Dean, a
Boston architectural firm that
specializes in restoration work, are
consulting architects for the pro-
ject. The Boston architects planned
and supervised the restoration of
Colonial Williamsburg. Clark, Nex-
sen and Owen, Washington and Lee
architects, drew up the specifications
for the restoration.

The Chapel's restoration marks
the second majer construction
job the Pettyjohn firm is handling
on the university’s campus. Other
Pettyjohn work crews are putting
the finishing touches on Washing-
ton and Lee’s $1,525,000 science fa-

| cilities for biology, chemistry, ge-

ology and physies.

Lee Chapel was built in 1867 un-
der the supervision of General
Robert E. Lee, who served as pres-
ident of Washington College (now
Washington and Lee) from 1865 un-
til his death in 1870. The building
was extended in 1883 to provide
space for Edward Valentine’s re-
cumbent statute and the Lee family
crypt where the Southern general’s
body rests. When the restoration is
completed, the Chapel will be as it
was in 1883 rather than 1867.

The Chapel was declared a Na-
tional Historic Landmark by the
U.S. Department of the Interior in
1961.

feel that the student of today, un-
like his counterpart a decade ago,
is prepared to take on his freedom.
Because of higher academic stand-
ards and tougher entrance require-
ments, the nature of the student
body is such that it is more mature
and responsible.

Several students observe that if
we were given unlimited cuts, some
teachers would have to improve the
quality of their classes. They will
have to have more to offer in their
lectures in order to keep up attend-
ance. Under the present system, stu-
dents argue, these less desirable
teachers are under no pressure to
improve.

Some Disagreement

Not all students favor change.
Some feel that unlimited cuts would
be disastrous to a good number of
the student body. They would be
tempted to take trips to remote girls’
colleges or extend their weekends a
day or two.

Others feel there should be a
compromise. Several felt that two
weeks of cuts would be more than
enough, rather than the proposed
unlimiteds.

Nevertheless, the general consen-
sus favors some type of change.
Kirkley has had an unusually good
response from the student body and
a great deal of encouragement from
the faculty. Several alternatives and
modifications are also being consid-
ered. Such evidence helps to point
out rather pointedly, that W&L,
the “bastion of tradition,’ might be
undergoing a new transition.

Euphorian Education
Offers Many Problems

Euphorians but, eliminating the ne-
cessity of doing most things, made
only a few things desirable. Yet the
rewards of earning were varied
enough to keep Euphorians from ap-
palling fates like singlemindedness
or contemplation or eccentricity.

Most appalling of all were two
major failings which the modern
Euphorians atavistically called here-
sies—discontent and curiosity. In
this country of smiles, where so-
phistication was the ability to sit
unflinchingly through a play with-
out a happy ending, the true Eu-
phorian did his best to conceal any
breach of contentment as quickly as
it appeared. This ability grew to be
prodigious. The Euphorians were
able to apply it, with some success,
to facts as well as opinions.

The task of killing curiosity was
more difficult, since curiosity had
long been regarded as a_ virtual
Euphorian patent. But modern Eu-
phorians, with so much done for
them, preferred to let curiosity grad-
ually doze off. They still said in
their speeches that every Euphorian
boy liked nothing better than to
take a car apart or explore the
sources of a forest river. But the
cars grew too complicated for the
amateur repairman and everyone
knew that all the forest rivers were
already carefully mapped.

Critics occasionally questioned
whether the happy Euphorians were
not destroying their own traditional
austerity of mind, valuable in re-
pairing furnaces, inventing nuclear
processes, and separating the com-
ponents of hazy diplomatic situa-
tions. The modern Euphorians re-
plied that mental austerity was as
uncomfortable, unnecessary and out-
moded as a kitchen without push-
buttons, or a speech without slogans.
Then they would repeat the new
national anthem which the children
were taught in the happiness schools:

We are the biggest; we are the

best;

We are ahead of all the rest.

It was at this point in their history,
that Euphoria found out that it was
not ahead.

The latest “ultimate” weapon of
destruction had been devised and
perfected by the Seythians, a larger
but traditionally dumber people
whose national symbol, the scowl,
had been warring with the Euphor-
ian smile. It was impossible to claim
that the Scythians had stolen the
weapon from them—a source of cur-
ious reassurance in similar cases.
for the Euphorians had possessed
none themselves. Nor could they
pass the discovery off as happen-

Pfeiffer Team
Dangerous Foe

Coach Dick Miller’s matmen meet
a small but determined Pfeiffer
College team in Doremus gym to-
morrow night at 8 pm. W&L will
be trying to maintain its undefeat-
ed status acquired by upsetting Old
Dominion 17-11 anc thoroughly
trouncing UNC 19-8. This will be
the team’s last competition as a unit
before the Chattanooga Invitational
Tournament.

Although not as strong as the Tar
Heels and Old Dominion, Pfeiffer
should not be regarded as easy. Last
year Pfeiffer gave Coach Miller’s
team a slight scare by leading the
match 9-8 at the end of the 157-
pound class. With returning stars
such as Boyd Stokes and Butch Al-
bie, Pfeiffer may be tougher than
expected. Coach Miller intends to
regard them as the toughest and go
all out against them.
