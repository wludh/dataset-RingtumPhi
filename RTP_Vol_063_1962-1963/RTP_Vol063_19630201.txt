Two Essay Contests
Open To Students

Two essay contests are now being
held which are open to all Wash-
ington and Lee students. The two
contests are the Cincinnati Society
and the Virginia Colonial Dames.
The first offers an award of $50 and
the second offers $200. The Colonial
Dames contest is for students of
Virginia colleges.

One essay may be submitted to
both contests. The essay must be
4,000 words or more and written on
an original subject in Virginia col-
colonial or military history. The es-
says must be in the hands of the
different judging committees by May
20, 1963.

Anone interested in these contests
may obtain a list of suggested topics

 

from C. W. Turner in Room 1,
duPont Hall.
All second semester fees, dor-

mitory rents and board were due
on Monday, February 4, 1963. They
may be paid in the office of the
Treasurer, 4 Washington Hall, any
day between 9 am. and 4 p.m. If
the bill was sent home the first
semester, it was automatically sent
home before the second semester

 

started.

Lewis F. Powell .

 

Named To Head |

Bar Association

Lewis F. Powell, Jr., W&L alum-

nus, Richmond attorney, and civic} |

and education leader, has been
named president-elect of the Amer-
ican Bar Association at its mid-year |
meeting in New Orleans.

He will assume the post formally
in August, and a year later, in Aug-

ust, 1964, he will move into the
presidency.
Powell will succeed Walter E.

Craig, of Phoenix, Ariz, the current
president president-elect. The cur-
rent president is Sylvester C. Smith,
Jr., of Newark, N. J.

Last August 6 Powell was elected
to represent the region of Virginia, |
Maryland, and the District of Co-
lumbia on the board of Governors
of the American Bar Association,

Visited Russia
In July, 1958, he visited the Soviet

Union as a member of a six-man
delegation from the ABA to study

.. pro- |!
vide intellectual stimulation to both | |

 

 

the Russian legal system and ex- |
change ideas between Russian and |
American lawyers.

What he saw behind the Iron Cur- |
tained moved him to urge on his
return that American education re- |
evaluate its curriculum in light of |
the cold war and the challenges of |
the space age.

To Combat Communism
Powell has urged the ABA to gO |
on record in favoring a course on)
communism in secondary schools |
as “an effective means of contrast- |
ing the merits of freedom of Western |
democracy and the 20th century |
capitalism and the brutal and re-|
pressive characteristics of “dictator- |
ship of the poletariat.”

As chairman of the City School |
Board he made a similar proposal |
to the National School Boards As- |
sociation and he has continued to
work for it as a member of the
State Board of Education.

Background

A member of the State Board of
Education for the past two years,
he served 11 years with the Rich-
mond School Board, nine of them
as chairman.

In 1960, for services to schools and
city, he was given the Good Gov-
ernment Award by the Richmond-
First Club.

The Virginia Education Associa-
tion gave him its distinguished serv-
ice award in 1958, and Hampden-
Sydney and Washington and Lee
colleges have conferred honorary
doctor of laws degrees upon him.
He holds academic degrees from
Washington and Lee and Harvard.

Judicature Society

He served for three years on the
board of directors of the American
Judicature Society and is a former
president of the Richmond Bar As-
sociation.

Powell, 55, is a senior member
of the law firm of Hunton, Williams,
Gay, Powell and Gibson. He is mar-
ried and has four children.

Powell will become the second
Richmonder to serve as ABA presi-
dent in this century. Henry St.
George Tucker was president in
1904-05 and his father John Ran-
dolph Tucker, was ABA president

 

in 1892-1893.

Moses, 28 and a native of Dan-
ville, is a designer with an archi-
tectural firm in Houston. He studied
under Dr. Junkin during his under-
graduate years at Washington and
Lee from 1952 to 1956. He also
studied interior design at the Pratt
Institute in New York City. A for-
mer U.S. Navy Officer, Moses was
a design consultant with a Dallas,

Automatic Rule
Forces 31 Men

Figures released this week show
that thirty-one students were forced
to sever their connections with the
university due to their first semester
grades. Of these, 15 were freshmen,
14 were sophomores, and two were
juniors.

These figures run slightly higher
than last year, and slightly lower
than the year before. Last year nine
freshmen, 16 sophomores, and three
juniors and seniors were dropped.
In February of 1961, a total of 22
freshmen and 12 upperclassmen fell
under the Automatic Rule.

Contrary to rumors circulating
about the campus, the number of
students transferring out at the end
of the first semester was small. The
Registrar’s Office has thus far re-
corded about 10 transfers and two

withdrawals. Most of these were| John M. Gunn, assistant professor

There were three transfer studens
admitted to Washington and Lee at
the beginning of this week. These
students were: Harold E. Klick from
Louisiana Polytechnic Institute,
Sydney Lewis from the University

Theme for the conference is “Trade

Dr. Behrman, who has been in the
U.S. Department of Commerce for
two years, taught economics at
Washington and Lee from 1952 to
1957 when he left to accept a facul-

Our Campus Book Store...
A Disgrace To The School

With the beginning of a new semester everyone is running
around attempting to get themselves organized. As always,
one of the major parts of this is the furious and often futile
attempt to secure the proper text books for one’s courses. By
this we refer to the conditions that exist in our campus book
store. Here, the student often finds that it is impossible to
secure the proper books for the courses for which he is regis-
tered.

All too often, there are not enough books to go around for
a course. This is almost inexcusable. Preliminary registration
allows a rough estimate to be made of the demands for a
book; however, these demands are seldom satisfied. It would
seem that those in charge of the book store would order more
than enough books for a course as they may always be returned
if they are not sold. Possibly this may be too much trouble.

One thing that we can say for the book store is that they
always are willing to order books, but the semester is often
half over before they arrive. By this time, a student may have
fallen behind in his work. Of course, it could be argued that one
could take the initiative and borrow books from others but
we feel that a student should be given an opportunity to have
his own book immediaely and not have to scrounge around in
an attempt to use the books of others.

In addition, our book store is far behind those on other
college campuses. Besides the above-mentioned faults, our book
store does not provide even a semblance of a selection of popu-
lar works. When everyone is attempting to raise the academic
standards and intellectual atmosphere of the school, one would
think that a good and adequate selection and supply of books
would be considered. Apparently it has not. When one stops
to consider, there is nowhere in Lexington tht ony may find a
reasonable selection of good books.

Another area of perennial complaint about the book store
is the seemingly excessive prices that are charged. Of course,
we are told that only a modest profit is made on the books
but when one can purchase some of the books out-of-town
stores at considerably lower prices, one begins to wonder.
Many times, a student’s book bill for a single semester can be
as high as sixty dollars. For many, it is often difficult to meet
this expense.

It would seem that this school would organize some sort of
book exchange as have many other schools. In the case of
exchanges, good used books are available to students at rea-
sonable costs. Unfortunately we have no such arrangement.

By now it should be quite evident that there are many
shortcomings in our book store on this campus. Unfortunately,
there is little that can be done. The book store is a monopoly.
They are free to do almost as they wish. It would be our hope
that Washington and Lee will wake up to this situation and take
some remedial action.

Our Traditions Considered
To Be Worth Preservin g

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir:

There seems to be much confusion
nowadays in the students’, perhaps
mainly freshmen’s, minds concerning
the value of Washington and Lee’s
“traditions.” I believe there exists
some uncertainty even in the minds

 

and places to be either unwise or
unenforceable, I would wish that
they reconsider this opinion. If
they do believe, however, a state-
ment to this effect would perhaps
clear the air for further discussion.
There are conceivable compro-
mises, such as conventional dress
enforced by individual fraternities

Concentration Of Power In Unions
Attacked As Threat To The Economy

By SENATOR BARRY GOLDWATER

In my understanding of the Constitution, the intent written into it by
our Founding Fathers was the prohibition against the gathering of power
in any one branch of our tripartite system of government or any segment of
our society.

We are witnessing in our National Government today, and we have for
nearly 3 decades, the movement of more and more rights away from the
people and the States into the hands of the bureaucrats in Washington.
And we have witnessed how this power can be used to benefit one seg-
ment of the economy, giving it monopolistic power.

I refer specifically to the concentration of power in the hands of
labor leaders of today. This power came about as the result of Feder-
al legislation. Its correction can only come through congressional
action which would remove those provisions of existing law which
confer a privileged status on labor unions. This exempt position is
not related to the unions’ bargaining power in legitimate labor-
management disputes.

I would suggest the tremendous concentration of potential power in
the hands of labor is contrary to the public interest, and in “the public”
I include the working union members.

Labor unions enjoy many special privileges and immunities under
Federal law which are creative of power. By far the most important
of these is the exclusive right to represent all the employees in the
unit for purposes of collective bargaining, even if the union has
been selected as a bargaining agent only by a narrow majority, which
in many circumstances under our existing law, in fact, constitutes
only a minority.

There is an unconscious tendency on the part of many to regard labor-
management relations as the exclusive concern of the parties directly
involved—i.e., of the union and employer.

Where a setilement is reached as the result of collective bargain-
ing and without the intervention of a work stoppage resulting from
either a strike or a lockout, it is safe to say, almost without exception,
that in reaching the settlement none of the negotiating parties paid
the slightest attention to its future impact on the economy of the Na-
tion or its effect on the public interest.

The public is the overlooked body in most of the legislation written
in the Congress of late, particularly in the field of labor-management re-
lations. There are protections written into the labor-management law, and
while they are not adequate, they exist; but the tendency today is to ignore
them and by this action to further ignore the important role the public
plays in any labor-management dispute.

It behooves us to examine the nature of the continually recurring
labor crises in the United States. Even a cursory examination will
reveal one obvious truth: that labor unions have access to to far too
much for the good of the economy or health of the Nation.

Now it surprises no one to realize the immense size and the great
economic strength possessed by American unions today. It is worth noting,
however, that big labor did not gain its present vital position in our society
wholly, or even primarily through its own efforts.

The Federal Government, that ever-present arbiter, policeman,
and entrepreneur of American life, has made organized labor
what it is today.

Just to give you an idea of the preferred position held by today’s union
in the economic scheme of things, I have compiled a list of special priv-
ilege, immunities and rights and powers enjoyed by labor unions under
the Federal law.

And let me emphasize at the outset that most of these special consid-
erations may have been justified when they were initially given to the
labor movement because of their weakness and lack of size. However, pos-
sible justification from a historical standpoint certainly doesn’t justify their
continued existence in today’s era of monopolistic union power.

The list I refer to is as follows:

1, Almost total immunity under the anti-trust laws.

2. Immunity from taxation.

3. Immunity from injunctions by Federal courts.

4. Authority to use union funds for purposes not related to collective
bargaining even where union membership is compulsory.

5. Power to compel workers to join the union as a condition of con-
tinued employment.

6. The right of a union selected by a majority of the workers to
bargain for all employees. This includes the right to bargain for those

New Ideas Sought
To Stimulate Readers

 

 

 

of certain Assimilation Committee
members whether conventional dress
need be worn to and from labora-
tories, or at what point a careless
tie becomes no tie for the Commit-
tee’s purposes. There seems to be
an absence of leadership from some
corner from which it should be com-
ing.

There seems to be discontent on
campus as a result of the well-
known Martin Luther King deci-
sion of last year. Unfortunate
though many may feel this deci-
sion was, it does not, in this opin-
ion necessarily sound a death-knell
of any kind for Washington and
Lee. There would seem little rea-
son, therefore, to wear ties at half-
mast in mourning

I have returned to Washington
and Lee to graduate after time in
the Army and at Southwestern-at-
Memphis, an institution which in
more ways than one sense looks to
W&L for leadership. I recall past
years here when there was a collec-
tion of pretty good men and boys
all wearing coats and ties. In years
such as those, Washington and Lee
met Wyoming in the Gator Bowl
and defeated Princeton in the Col-
lege Quiz Bowl. Those who would
wish to see such years return will
not help things by knocking W&L
tradition. Let us not confuse aban-
donment of tradition with liberal-
ization of atmosphere.

If the Executive Committee and
others in authority believe strict
conventional dress at all times

 

and the IFC, with non-fraternity
men free to dress as they please,
but I am sure this is recognized
as an inferior solution to the prob-
lem.

It is argued by some that the
proper solution will occur when the
Assimilation Committee is abolished
entirely, and enforcement of con-
ventional dress occurs spontaneously.
This might be an interesting exper-
iment, but, in any case, in order
for conventional dress to stand as
an ideal it must, it would seem, be
defined by the Executive Commit-
tee or by some superior authority
as being proper and called for at
all times and at all places within the
Town of Lexington.

Sincerely,
JOHN A. LACKMANN

BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF

The budding of the new semester
affords an opportunity for the Ring-
tum Phi editorial page to pause and
take inventory of itself. “Self-
criticism is the rod of divination,”
as an old expression goes. And like
any top-notch newspaper staff, we
simply refuse to be satisfied, however
great our achievement may be. What
we resolve to do is look beyond
the shower of compliments we con-
stantly receive and try to pick out
what’s left to be desired.

What we are trying to avoid is
the idea of merely filling up space.
We confess that there might be some
readers who feel it’s a waste of time
to turn beyond page one except to
read Peanuts (thank goodness for
Peanuts!)

Is this just human nature that
people shy away from intellectual
stimulation? However true this
may be, we of the editorial staff
will never give up. We stand
perched as Ulysses’ sirens ever
beckoning the reader with our
singing. If we are persistent, we
are bound to hit the right tune.

If you'll recall, the second page
has not failed to offer original ideas.
These have included proposals for
more progressive education, for a
new cut system, and for review be-
fore examinations.

Perhaps we have offered an over-
dose of academic subjects. Or is it
that the ideas are all of the same
nature and consequently lose their
stimulus for the reader?

We have thought and thought

 

about this problem, and after the
third case of beer we finally drew
several pertinent conclusions.

Our first problem is an age-old
one, i.e., that the prophets and seers
have lost touch with the common
masses. Observing campus life
through their ivory towers, they fail
to discern the actual needs within
the student body.

Now at this point, the reader may
claim he doesn’t have any needs.
That is our very problem! If the
reader is going to be that way about
the whole thing, then it is up to
the Ring-tum Phi to start finding
some needs for you. We contend,
then, that you may not know you
have these needs, but by Jove you
are going to get them if it’s the
last thing we do.

This campus just isn't healthy
if our “angry young men” don't
have something to complain about.
Columnist Pete Alford, who isn’t
with us today because of illness,
pointed out in the Fancy Dress
Edition (remember?) that _ this
year we have not had any of
the controversial issues which
sprang up last year—the Martin
Luther King episode, the IFC,
etc. We realize this is an unhealthy
sign and we have been beating the
bushes all semester to find juicy
controversies.

There is another matter we ought
to include. We have been unable
to find anyone to fill the shoes of
our illustrious ex-columnist Thorns
Craven (bless his soul!) Through

(Continued on page 4)

 

who were compelled to join the union as well as those who can be

arbitrarily denied membership.

7. Power to compel the employer to bargain exclusively with the ma-

jority union.

8. Absolute authority to deny union membership to workers employed
in the bargaining unit, on any grounds or for no reason at all.

9. The right, in some situations, to invade the privacy of workers, even
against their wishes. This deprives them of a legal right enjoyed by all

other members of society.

10. The right, in some situations, to compel employers to make
available for union use the private property of the employer.
11. The right to compel the employer to provide protection against any
physical violence on the part of workers who resist invasion of their

privacy.

12, Unions are immune from the payment of damages for personal
and property injuries inflicted on employers or others by union
members engaged in activities, such as strikes or picketing. And this
stands even in situations where such activities have been officially
authorized and directed by the union.

13. The right to strike for objectives wholly unrelated to any proper
subject of collective bargaining. This is in contrast to the severely limited
right of an employer to engage in a lockout.

14. The right in some situations, to examine an employer's books and

records—including those containing such confidential data as costs, profits

and prices.

15. And finally, the almost complete immunity of unions from any
liability, penalty, or restriction under State law under the doctrine

of Federal preemption.

In listing the special grants and immunities, I do it not to suggest
that all of them should necessarily be removed, but to illustrate just what

powers unions have.

I certainly do not feel that the public interest is served by the possession
of the monopolistic power by unions. I am convinced that it must be
limited and I intend to introduce legislation to restore a more reasonable
and workable balance in the Nation’s labor-management relationship.

The enactment of legislation which will protect the interests of
individual worker, labor, management, and the public will prepare
way for the conduct of free and fair collective bargaining without

need for Government meddling.

Kirkley Proposes
Suggestion Box

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Recently business organizations
have instituted a company suggestion
box system, according to the Wall
Street Journal. Any employee of
the firm is allowed to proffer his
ideas about ways in which the func-
tioning of the company can be im-
proved.

Some suggestions involve change
or minor alterations in products,
others the streamlining or variation
of labor-management relations,
others the installment of an ice-
water fountain or Coke machine in
a certain part of a plant.

Most suggestions accepted by the
company are followed by a mon-
etary reward to the employee with
the bright idea. Some underlings
have received thousands of dol-
lars for their ideas because they
have saved the company money
and time, cut down the cost of op-
erations or increased productivi-
ty. At the management level, re-
wards usually consist of a cita-
tion.

What a wonderful idea! This sug-
gestion box is a positive thing, un-
like the assimilation box, whereby
the humblest member of a complex
organization can contribute to the
overall functioning of the whole and
win a measure of pride in his com-
pany, the applause of his peers, and
the respect of his superiors.

All going concerns, including
families, churches, and particularly
Washington and Lee, should have
such a suggestion box. The oc-
casional, anonymous “The boss
should go to H---” notes would
be far outweighed by constructive
suggestions which could consider-
ably improve group functioning
and benefit all concerned.

Just as a start, here are a few
suggestions for consideration!

Washington and Lee needs a gen-
uine buyers Co-op. A Co-op is a
group of buyers or sellers who get

 

together to promote their own in-
terests. In a buyers Co-op, the great-
er portion of profits is distributed to
the buyers through discounts when
buying and periodic profit-sharing.
Such a Co-op would be profitable to
its organizers and would be a source
of savings to W&L students.

We should have a_tri-mester
system at W&L. Each term would
consist of approximately ten weeks
of classes, followed by one week
of exams and two weeks vacation,
As it is, the course of study at
W&L is broken up in the first se-
mester by the Christmas holidays
and in the second by Spring Holi-
days. Term papers and exams are
a holiday burden and destroy part
of the value of the change of va-
cation.

Washington and Lee needs a
Mory’s, but since we cannot have
one, perhaps a decent student owned
and operated restaurant-hangout
would do.

According to Oscar Handlin, quot-
ed in a past issue of this paper (No.
14), a grading system such as ours
is outmoded, restrictive, destructive.
Some have suggested a grading
system of three categories: failure,
passing, superior.

A final suggestion is that stu-
dents should be allowed to help
each other with their assignments.
Learning comes about through the
meeting of ideas—either in con-
fiict or agrement, The student-
student relationship can be more
complete and therefore more re-
warding than the student-teacher
relation in many cases; often
teachers do not have the time to
explain material carefully to stu-
dents, whereas other students
might be able to take the time.

Change is not necessarily prog-
ress; but through instituting change,
we can make the real conform more
closely to our conceptions of the
ideal.

Tankmen Blast Dominion
As Four Records Topple

In a successful bid for their fourth
win of the season the varsity swim-
ming team crushed Old Dominion
College 60-28 and set four pool rec-
ords in the process, as the meet
marked the last before the start of
exam week.

Records

Old Dominion failed to enter the
opening 400-yard medley relay event
but W&L promptly threw away the
seven point gift with a disqualifi-
cation. Sophomore John Wolfe
brightened the scoring picture, how-
ever, with a record-breaking 1:56.0
in the 200-yard freestyle with the
Generals’ number two man Walt
McManus a close second.

Freshman John Lifter immediately
added five more points with a rec-
ord in the 200-yard individual med-
ley as he was clocked in 2.108,
breaking Elliot Maynard's long-
standing record.

In the 200-yard butterfly event
another freshman, Bo Bokinsky, also

Trackmen Fall
In VMI Meet

A small remnant of the W&L
track team participated in a meet
at the VMI fieldhouse house Sat-
urday.

Due to complications resulting
from Fancy Dress, only a handfull of
runners were on hand for the meet
with Clemson, VMI, UNC, Duke,
Maryland, Furman and Tennessee.

Against this strong competition
the Generals were only able to gain
fifth place in two events.

Robin Kell grabbed a fifth in the
hop-step-jump, a very respectable
feat for him since his normal special-
ty is high-jump.

The trackmen also took a fifth
in the sprint-shuttle relay. Essex,
Pearson, Chris Kell and Meyers took
part in this event.

erased one of former captain May-
nard’s records in 2:18.1.

The final 400-yard freestyle re-
lay team of Monsarrat, Hart, Jahn-
cke, and Casto, finished the meet
with a record-breaking 2:23.9, one
tenth of a second under the former
record set last year.

Four Meet Remain

At the end of seven meets the
Generals’ record stands at 4-3. With
Georgetown, West Virginia, Mary-
land, and East Carolina remaining,
Coach Norris Eastman only com-
ments that the season’s end will tell
the tale. All four teams are strong
with Maryland the strongest.

Top Scorers

Individual scoring Freshman Bo
Bokinsky heads the list with 47
points, with Sophomore John Wolfe
close behind at 43, and Art Broadus
with 22.

Due to illness captain Herb Jahncke
will be unable to finish the season.
His loss will be felt greatly in the
coming weeks as the freestyle events
and the leadership of the team are
both forced to adapt to his absence.

Grapplers Stover
Winfield And Smith
Remain Undefeated |

Washington and Lee University’s
undefeated wrestling team goes
back into action after a two-week
exam break Saturday night against
Duke’s Blue Devils in Lexington.

The 8:30 p.m. Duke match is
the first bout on a tight W&L
schedule which sends Coach Dick
Miller’s grapplers against six op-
ponents in 14 days. As a further
complication, three of the Gener-
erals’ six foes—Franklin and Mar-
shall, West Virginia and Virginia—

boast top-notch teams this year.

After their Saturday encounter
with Duke, the Generals entertain
North Carolina State Monday night.
The match is set for 8:30 p.m.

Three Undefeated Men

The Generals, 4-0 so far, will send
three undefeated wrestlers—Tom
Stover, Pete Winfield and Herb
Smith—against Duke and North
Carolina State. Stover wrestles in
the 147-pound class, Winfield goes
at 157 and Smith is in the 177-pound
category.

Washington and Lee had little
trouble with Duke last year, posting
a 19-8 victory at Durham. Duke’s
lone wins came in the 130-pound
and 167-pound classes. This year,
the Blue Devils are suffering an off
year. In four meets Duke has won
only six of 32 bouts.

North Carolina State forced the
Generals to go all out for a win in
1962 and appear to be tough again
this year. The Generals did not
clinch a 16-14 triumph last year
until Smith pinned State’s Jack
Watson in the 177-pound class.
Don Athern and Bill Sullivan are
State’s top returnees. These two
plus four sophomores form the
Wolfpack nucleus.

Remaining Schedule
Feb. 9, Duke, home; Feb. 11, North
Carolina State, home; Feb. 16,
Franklin and Marshall, away; Feb.
19, Hampden-Sydney, home; Feb.
23, West Virginia, away; Feb. 25,
Virginia, home.

NOTICE
The varsity wrestling team will be
competing against North Carolina
State on Monday, February 11.
