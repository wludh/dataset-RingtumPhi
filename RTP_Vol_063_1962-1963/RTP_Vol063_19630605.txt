Chapel To

Reopen

Early This August

The re-opening of Washington and Lee University’s his-
toric Lee Chapel—under restoration since last June—has been
set for early August, university officials said today.

Plans at the time of the announcement of the $370,000
restoration called for the nearly 100-year-old Chapel to be
ready in time for Washington and Lee’s commencement ex-

ercises on June 7. However, rep-*——————

resentatives of the John P. Petty-
john Company of Lynchburg, gen-
eral contractor for the job have in-
dicated they cannot have their work
crews out of the Chapel before July
Le

D. E. Brady, superintendent of
buildings and grounds at Washing-
ton and Lee, said it would take an-
other month after the contractor
completes his work to put the fin-
ishing touches on the structure that
was designed by General Robert E.
Lee and built in 1867.

No one special problem has
slowed the structure's restoration,
rather the care taken in the pres-
ervation work has altered the
schedule outlined in original plan-
ning, Brady said.

The complete restoration of Lee
Chapel, where General Lee is buried,
was started last June after the Ford
Motor Company Fund of Dearborn,
Mich., gave Washington and Lee the
$370,000 for the undertaking. The
funds were given to the university
to “help preserve one of the South’s
most prized landmarks.”

Although an exact date has not
been selected for the Chapel re-
opening, university officials said the
building will be open before August
10. Formal re-dedication ceremonies
will be held in the early Fall after
Washington and Lee’s 215th aca-
demic year gets underway.

Pettyjohn crews currently are
resetting door frames and other
millwork that were removed when
the restoration was first started.
Painting, sanding of the oroginal
floors and the installation of elec-
trical equipment also are under-
way now.

Last week, workers turned to
pouring concrete walks, grading and
cleaning up around the exterior of
the structure. Construction officials
hope to remove a wooden fence that
has surrounded the project for more
than 10 months before the univer-
sity’s commencement exercises on
June 6 and 7.

The installation of steel beams
in the floor and roof of the Chapel
plus concrete sub-flooring for the
auditorium was completed more than
two months ago. At one point in the
restoration project, the floor and
roof of the Chapel were completely
removed. Each piece of the flooring
and the slate from the roof were
marked when they were removed in
order to replace them in their origi-
nal locations.

Although emphasis in the Chapel
project is on restoration, certain ex-
tensive improvements have been
made to assure the future preserva-
tion of the building and its valuable
contents.

A fire alarm system has been in-
stalled along with safety devices
to detect leaks and faulty equip-
ment operation. The Chapel will
be completely air-conditioned to
aid in preserving the million-dol-
lar art collections that hangs there
and the hundreds of Lee memora-
bilia that again will be displayed
in the Chapel’s first floor museum

A special underground room was
added in front of the building to
house sizeable heating, air-condi-
tioning and electrical units. The
room will not be visible to visitors.

Considerable remodeling has been
done in the Chapel’s museum to pro-
vide for better display of the histori-
cal holdings relating to Lee and the

 

period of the 1860’s. The office used
by General Lee when he was pres-
ident of Washington College (now
Washington
1870 has been restored

is being refurbished.

Young GOP’s
End Active Year

By GEORGE PRIGGEN

In March, seven Washington and

Lee Young Republicans went down
to Williamsburg for the Young Re-
publican Regional Convention, en-
compassing delegates from a four-
state (Washington, D.C.) area.

The W&L delegation spent three
memorable days enjoying the sights
of Williamsburg, and participating in

the work of the Regional Conven- |

tion. The delegation voted as a unit,
in order to give greater strength to
the W&L position. The W&L delega-
tion was especially successful in ef-
fecting a “watering-down” of sev-
eral “civil rights” proposals in the
YR Regional platform.

At the convention John Lundy of
W&L was elected 1st Vice-President
of the Virginia State YR Federation.
The Convention next year will be
something for all W&L Young Re-
publicans to look forward to.

Officers of the Young Republican
Club of W&L were elected at the
end of April: President, Jerry Caden;

Vice-Presidents, Gavin Garrett and’!

George Priggen; Corresponding Sec-
retary, Benton Bolton; Recording
Secretary, Charles Owen; Treasur-
er, Alex Rasin; Parliamentarian,
John Lundy; and Advisors, Craig
Distelhorst and Robert Wheelock.

 

Finals Concert Successful
With Top Local Talent

The Finals Concert this year was
an unqualified success, thanks main-
ly to a newly discovered local talent.

A student group called the Way-
siders stole the show on Tuesday
night with a half hour of folk-
song entertainment that shook Dore-
mus Gymnasium with applause. This
group consists of two upcoming jun-
iors, Dave Trussell of Towson, Md.,
and Jim Ledbetter of San Francisco,
Cal.

Joining the Waysiders Tuesday
night was the Rooftop Singers, a
nationally famous folksinging trio.
They gained a strong applause from

Debate Team Completes
Most Successful Season

The Washington and Lee debate
team ended the 1962-63 school year
with “more tournaments, more vic-
tories, and more participants” than
ever before, says Director of Foren-
sics William W. Chaffin.

For the third straight year, Bill
Noell and Al Eckes were the big-
gest names in Virginia debate com-
petition. This year W&L also put
some ne wnames in the field—two
freshmen whom Chaffin calls the
best prospects since Noell andEckes
arrived: Mike Hayslip and Ed Fitz-
gerald.

W&L closed out the debate season
with a trip to the national cham-
pionships at West Point, New York,
and, although they failed to place
among the top teams, earned a vic-
tory over Dartmouth, which won
the national title.

The first major tournament of last
fall was the Old Dominion Tour-
nament in which W&L placed first
in the two-man division. Noell won
the Persuasive Speaking contest,
while Eckes finished third in After
Dinner Speaking.

October 29: the W&L team appears

on Norfolk television for an exhi-
bition match, winning the debate.

Host Tournament
November 16: Washington and Lee
hosts the regional Tau Kappa Alpha
Debate Tournament. Bill Boardman,
captain of the W&L team, is presi-
dent of the regional TKA organiza-
tion. Although Noell and Eckes have

won the TKA championship as fresh-| ,

men and sophomores, they do not
enter as juniors, due to their posi-
tions as hosts.

Eckes and Norton Win

December 1: Eckes and Ed Nor-
ton win first place in the Pittsburgh
Cross Examination Tournament, go-
ing undefeated. By placing first in
number of speakers, Eckes establish-
es himself as one of the top debaters
in the country.

December 8: Noel land Norton
fail to place in the Dixie Classic
Tournament at Wake Forest, but
Noell wins awards of excellence in
debate and in  extemporaneous
speaking.

March 10: Noell and Eckes compile
a 4-2 record in Georgetown’s Cher-
ry Blossom Invitational.

Qualify

March 16: Noell and Eckes quali-
fy for the national championships by
earning a 12-4 record in preliminary
rounds at King’s College in Pennsyl-
vania. After losing their first four
rounds in the meet, they snap back
with a 12-decision winning streak.

April 13: Eckes and Ed Fitzgerald
win the Old Dominion Debate Tour-
nament with an undefeated slate.
Eckes wins first place in speaker
points, and Fitzgerald places fourth.
Mike Hayslip, debateing with Jack
Eure, places second in _ speaker
points. Fitzgerald and Hayslip, both
freshmen, prove themselves out-
standing prospects.

Graduation

From The Past

The following was written in 1947 by Charlie McDowell.
then a student at Washington and Lee. Things are pretty much
the same. Only the date has changed.

A,
Ww

One bright June morning pretty soon now a crowd will
gather at a little college chapel to see a graduation .They will
take seats on the hard straightbacked seats inside the little
building on the rows of folding chairs set up in the sunshine
and maple-shade outside.

Mothers and fathers will meet other mothers and fathers,
and little sisters will be introduced to roommates. A grand-
father will tell a girl from Hollins about the time he sat on the
same hard seats waiting for his own diploma.

Four young wives will sit together talking about new ad-
dresses and the old bridge club. An usher who is just a little
hung over will show an elderly lady who hasn’t missed a gradu-
ation in thirty years to her seat.

As people with cameras edge closer to the sidewalk, a bell
will begin to ring. A long line of boys in black robes and tassled
hats will move down the center walk two-by-two and out of step.
Some will smile, some frown, and some will seem sad.

They will file into the little chapel; there will be coughing
and scraping of feet; and then a man will begin to speak. The
graduating class of 1963 will sit down and listen.

The man will talk about Washington and Lee and a boy in
the third row will look out the windows at the green tree in the
sun and will think about Washington and Lee. He will re-
member the glare of the sun in his eyes as he lay on a big warm
rock in Goshen Pass listening to tumbling water. He will re-
member sitting on the grass in the Spring talking and drinking
a Coke.

He will remember a lecture on Milton and a power lawn
mower droning across the wide expanse of green outside. He
will remember a fraternity room late at night filling with cigar-
ette smoke and argument and friendship.

He will remember a hillside red and gold and amber in the
Fall. He will remember a history book and scrambled eggs at
two in the morning and a truck driver dozing over his french
fries.

He will remember a cold winter night in a car rolling toward
Lexington and a wonderful off-key song. And he will remember
running down the hill from the library at dusk along the slick
cement walks with Spring rain falling in the dark trees.

He will remember . . . Washington and Lee.

Dean Frank J. Gilliam
To Step Down

Although no official announcement has been made, it is
common knowledge that with the end of this school year,
Dean of Admissions Frank J. Gilliam will step down from his
post on the Hill. Dean Gilliam’s resignation closes three de-
cades during which he has been an institution at Washington
and Lee—during which he has become a symbol of the Uni-
versity itself. There are few men on the W&L faculty who can
match him for tenure of service, and fewer still who can match
him for value of contribution, Probably there is nobody else
living who is, to the students and to the alumni, so representa-
tive of Washington and Lee.

It has been nearly 50 years since Frank J. Gilliam entered
W&L as a student. Since 1926 he has been either on the facul-
ty or in the administration of the school. He was W&L’s first
Dean of Students, and its first Dean of Admissions, and until
last year he held both these positions at the same time. During
1963, his last year of official association with W&L, an award
was established in his name by the student body, and the year-
book was dedicated to him. The Editors of the Calyx wrote in
their statement honoring Dean Gilliam: “If the dedication of
this book conveys the idea that Dean Gilliam’s contribution
to the progress of Washington and Lee transcends all verbal
tribute, then our purpose is accomplished.”

Friday Edition, Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University
Dear Sir:

Recently Jim Ledbetter suggested
in a letter “that the foreign exchange
program as it is at this school be
dropped.”

He feels this way because the
foreign students receive a negative
impression of America and Wash-
ington and Lee through the program.
He concludes that, since this is a
result of conditions at W&L, either
the school should be changed, which
he feels to be impossible, or the pro-
gram ended.

I think that the program should
not only be continued, but increased,
that is we should try to bring more
foreign students to W&L and we
should also try to set up programs
so more of our students could spend
the junior year abroad.

The success of a foreign exchange
program, like the success of any
human institution, depends upon
people. Schools and programs change
only as the individuals in them
change. Better people make better
institutions.

The present means of feeding and
housing foreign students and the
inadequate chance they have of be-
coming a part of university life con-
tribute to the weakness of the pro-
gram; some of these things are now
undergoing change.

What is most important, however,
is that each individual student who
believes in the worthiness of the ex-
change program take it upon himself
to act as host and, if possible, a
friend to all future foreign students.

Hospitality among the Greeks was
given divine sanction by the gods
of Olympus; it has fallen into disuse
in America.

The problem of hospitality, ex-
istential solitude, apathy, communi-
cation, and friendship are all inter-
connected. Only individuals can
seek to remedy the problems.

JOHN KIRKLEY

Research

In the psychology laboratory at
Washington and Lee University, a
senior performs a delicate brain op-
eration on a white rat, while in an
adjoining room, another student
clocks other white rats in their prog-
ress through a simple maze.

Across town, in the privacy of his
own room, a student sits down with
a stack of seldom-used books from
the recesses of Washington and Lee
library and prepares to search them
for references to French philoso-
pher Pierre Abelard.

Fifty miles away, in the Roanoke
office of the president of a small
metal fabricating plant, another
Washington and Lee student ques-
tions the older man about the way
he operates his business.

In the physics laboratories of the
university's new science building,
several students patiently set up
another attempt to “grow” a pure
single crystal of zine in a high
temperature furnace that they
helped design and build.

Still another student quietly but
thoroughly pores over a collection
of faded letters—most of them a
century old—in ‘the office of a his-
tory professor.

In spite of the diversity of these
activities, each of these students
is working in the same program at
Washington and Lee. Their work is
typical of the activities of some 75
of the university’s students during
the current academic year.

Each is engaged in a_ highly-
specialized area of research, each
is working under the guidance of
a professor who is a trained re-
searcher and each is permitted a
degree of responsibiliy in the pro-
ject that is commensurate with his
training and experience.

All are part of Washington and
Lee’s Robert E. Lee Research Pro-
gram for Undergraduates—now in
its third year of operation. The
program is supported by a 1960 gift
of more than a quarter of a million
dollars from an alumnus, the late Dr.
Gustavus B. Capito of Charleston,
West Va. This fund was later aug-
mented by two gifts from the
Charleston Foundation for Research,
and under the combined support, the
program has grown significantly.

Each student in the program is

either a Robert E. Lee Research
Assistant or a Robert E. Lee Re-
search Scholar. Both terms mean
distinction on the Washington and
Lee campus.

In many instances, the student’s
project involves research interests

 

 

University Christian Association
Logs Another Successful Year

Everyone on campus is familiar
with the organization known as the
University Christian Association, but
how many outside of the immediate
active membership know about its
functions, purposes, and organiza-
tion? It would not be overly pre-
sumptious to say not many.

The purpose of the UCA is to
stimulate intellectual understanding
of Christianity and to act for the
benefit of the community. Its mem-
bership includes (and this will be a
surprise to most) everyone enrolled
at Washington and Lee, inclusive
of all faiths. There are, however,
only around forty to fifty people who
actively work for the UCA, which
is financed by the University.

The association consists of four
committees, each of which is headed
by a committee chairman. The com-
mittees are: the Community Service
Committee, the Mountain Missions
Commititee, the Boys Club Commit-
tee, and the Seminars in Religion
Committee. These groups are co-
ordinated by the UCA Executive
Committee consisting of the Presi-
dent, two Vice-Presidents, a Secre-
tary, Treasurer, and the four com-
mittee chairmen. The UCA also
has a faculty advisor, who currently
is Dr. Louis W. Hodges.

Community Service

The Community Service Committee
has a wide and varied range of
functions. It works in close coopera-
tion with the Lexington Welfare De-
partment ito provide relief for the
poor of Rockbridge County. Every
third Wednesday of each month,
members of this committee distribute
surplus food to people who present
slips issued by the Welfare Depart-
ment. The food is provided by the
Federal Government.

The Community Service Commit-
tee also collects needed clothing,
turns it over to the Welfare Depart-
ment, and does incidental work for
this bureau of the city government.
Last winter, the committee helped to
plan the Christmas candlelight serv-

Program

of the supervising faculty member,
in which case the student serves as
a research assistant or apprentice,
carrying out assignments at the di-
rection of his professor. In other
projects, the research may have been
conceived by the student himself,
then planned and executed under the
supervision of a professor interested
in helping the undergraduate.

In virtually every case, the work
of the students and their level of
involvement is comparable with that
normally undertaken by the gradu-
ate level in pursuit of advanced de-
grees. The close relationships be-
tween students and professors is
similar to that encountered at the
Ph.D. level in graduate school, uni-
versity officials note.

Established in the second semes-
ter of the 1960-61 session, the Rob-
ert E. Lee Research Program first
involved only 25 students in a
handful of projects. By 1961-62, 57
students were active in 49 projects.
Participation has increased even
more this academic year with 72
students working in 55 projects
under 34 professors who represent
17 academic areas.

 

Although a large number of pro-
jects concern the natural sciences,
the humanities and social sciences
are well-represented in the pro-
gram, and a university-wide balance
is achieved in application of the
program’s funds.

Represented in the 1962-63 pro-
jects are such diverse fields as
accounting, music, sociology, lin-
guistics, economics, public speak-
ing, military science, commerce,
modern foreign languages, English,
philosophy, history and law, as well
as the sciences—biology, chemistry,
geology, physics and psychology.

Dr. W. W. Pusey, UI, Dean of
the College and the man who di-
rects the overall program, expects
student and faculty interest in re-
search to increase still further,
probably to a point where the
limited funds available for the
program will place student appli-
eants in a highly competitive situa-
tion.

The overall purpose of the pro-
gram is to present undergraduates
with an opportunity to work closely
with professors in meaningful re-
search projects that will acquaint the
students with the tools, techniques
and odology of scholarly and scien-
tific investigation.

A principal benefit of the pro-
gram is the stimulus given to the
intellectual curiosity of the students.
Even for students who do not in-

 

ice at R. E. Lee Memorial Church
and tendered its services in Dr.
Colvin’s plan for the re-settlement
of a Cuban refugee family in Lex-
ington.

One of the more outstanding
works of the Community Service
Committee was to redecorate the
UCA reading room—the room just
to the right of the front door of the
Student Union. This year, members
of the committee re-painted this
room; furnished it with a new carpet,
sofa, two easy chairs, several pic-
tures, and desks; and provided it
with a special rack containing book-
lets on pertinent theological topics.
These booklets are on sale at 50c
apiece. One third of the original
stock has already been sold.

Student Sermons

The Mountain Missions Commit-
tee serves an educational purpose.
It’s members go to various churches
in Rockbridge County where they
teach Sunday school, deliver ser-
mons, and help conduct the respec-
tives services. There are five
churches and missions in the Moun-
tain Missions Committee’s program:
the Clark Mountain Mission, McEl-
wee Chapel, the Broad Creek Pres-
byterian Church, the House Moun-
tain Mission, and the Poplar Hill
Presbyterian Church.

Last Christmas, the committee
gave a party for the children of
Lexington. Presents for the occasion
were given by the Lexington Presby-
tery.

Recreation for Boys

The Boys Club Committee provides
recreation and guidance for many of
the city’s boys. This committee or-
ganizes and referees games such as
football, baseball, and basketball for
the groups of boys in its care. Such
groups are often taken to Doremus
gymnasium where they may have
the opportunity to swim in the gym’s
pool.

The Boys Club Committee has also
conducted what is known as the
Big Brother Program. In this pro-

gram, each participating commit-
teeman is assigned to a delinquent
young person and serves as _ his
counselor and helper.

Theological Discussions

Finally, there is the Seminars in
Religion Committee, the branch
which concentrates on the theologi-
cal and intellectual education of the
active members of UCA and of the
entire school, regarding the guest
speaker program. This committee
conducts seminars between W&L
and Sweet Briar, Randolph-Macon,
and Hollins respectively. The sub-
jects for discussion range from in-
tegration to the life of the academic
community, “practically anything
you can think of” according to Rod
Cockshutt, next year’s President of
UCA.

The Seminars in Religion Commit-
tee further provides the school with
guest speakers, such as O. Hobart
Mowrer of the University of Illi-
nois who spoke on guilt therapy for
the mentally ill by group discussion
last November. In this particular
case, the UCA combined with the
Psychology department to make Dr.
Mowrer’s talks possible.

New Officers Chosen

The association has recently held
elections and will be ready to begin
its operations again next September
when school opens. Working under
Cockshutt will be Ken Lane, the
Vice-President for Discussions;
Shannon Jung, the Vice-President
for Seminars; and Malcolm Morris,
Secretary.

In summary, we see how the Uni-
versity Christian Association plays
an extremely valuable role in com-
munity and university life. It at once
helps provide for some of the physi-
cal, spiritual, and recreational need
of the Lexington area and stimulates
the intellectual growth of its own
participants. It is certainly a worth-
while and rewarding activity for any
student wishing to participate, which
is not very difficult to do since we
are all member of the UCA anyway!

 

Keynotes Variety

tend to go on to graduate school,
participation in the program is re-
warding and challenging.

No Robert E. Lee Research Pro-
gram participants receive academ-
ic credit for their work nor do
they feel that this kind of program
should involve grades and credit.
R. Meade Christian, Jr., of Rich-
mond, Washington and Lee’s 1963
valedictorian who assists biology
professor Dr. L .R. Emmons in a
project in cytogenetics, feels the
Lee program offers undergradu-
ate a unique relationship with
professors.

“I think it is good for students
to work with their professors and
not be concerned with getting an ‘A’
or ‘B’ result,” Christian said. “It’s
a real change of pace for me to
work with Dr. Emmons, share his
excitement and his enthusiasms—
and his disappointments. This pro-
gram encourages students to do
things on their own, and for me,
it has been excellent technical train-
ing for my future work in medical
school.”

The program, in addition to the
research advantages, offers campus
part-time employment for partici-
pants, Each student agrees to de-
vote a given number of hours to
his work during a semester, and
he is compensated at an hourly
rate based on his experience.

Some of the students achieve al-
most total involvement in their re-
search. William M. Durrett, an At-
lanta senior, has acquired a surgeon’s
skill in his works with Dr. Leonard
E. Jarrard’s white rats—used by the
professor in a number of psychology
studies. Durrett even keeps a sleep-
ing bag in his laboratory in duPont
Hall so he can work late and get an
early start. He is so interested in
the experiments that he hopes to
return next year as a special stu-
dent to continue his assistance to
Dr. Jarrard.

“You learn to be patient and work
hard without expecting dramatic re-
sults at every turn,” says Robert
M. Auburn, a senior pre-medical
student from Falls Church, Va. who
