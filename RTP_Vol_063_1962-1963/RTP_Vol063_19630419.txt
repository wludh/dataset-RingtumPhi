The Trend Towards Seminars

There is a slowly-developing trend at Washington and
Lee toward seminar courses which is very encouraging. Before
saying anything more, it should be mentioned that this trend
is necessarily slow because both the money available for the
additional seminar courses and the time professors need to teach
such courses are scarce. But if department heads will focus
attention on possibilities for such courses in the next few years,
adding more to the ones currently offered, the student body
would profit immensely.

The English department, which previously had only three
courses dealing with specific figures (Shakespeare, Milton, and
Chaucer), has added a seminar course to begin next year which
we feel could be a model for seminars in other departments.
The plan for this course is reported on page one today in the
absence of a spring catalogue.

A seminar course which is limited to eight ar ten students,
which is taught in the discussion method, and which is inten-
sive rather than extensive in its subject, would prepare students
for graduate work in their field of study, and help them to
find a specific center of interest. The plan of the English de-
partment to rotate the subjects taught from year to year is
sound in that it allows for seminars in many subjects, and since
an old course was eliminated to make way for the new one,
the problems of financing and scheduling were minimized.

Although the History department has several courses in
Modern European history, opportunities for concentrated
seminar work in Modern European history should be explored.
Over a period of two years, four different seminars could be
offered: 1815 to 1848; 1848 to 1900; 1900 to 1933; and
1933 to the present. By making these seminars available to
seniors and juniors with permission of the department head,
history majors planning to do graduate work would be pre-
pared for their future study.

Another suggestion for both the history and the political |
science departments is a year-long course in socialism and in
the evolution of communism out of socialism and the evolu-
tion of fascism. Socialism could be studied the first semester,
and the second two systems in 1 the second semester. The semi-

Editor Of Shenandoah Reviews Past Year

Nature of Shenandoah |

Mr. Boatwright describes Shenan- |
doah as “typical of dozens of ‘little |
magazines’ published by colleges and |
universities.” Rather limited in their |
appeal, they do not try to cater to
a general public or achieve high cir-
culation rates. Mr. Boatwright feels
that they are important because}
they can introduce writers that are
new, controversial, or important but
overlooked by the larger magazines.

“We are under no advertising pres-
sure,” he states, “and consequently |
are able to provide an 1 exception t to!

It may come as a surprise to some
students that Washington and Lee
publishes a literary review known
Shenandoah, a quarterly affair
that includes fiction, poetry, and erit-
icism, by both well-established and
fast-rising American writers. In the
past year there have been contri-
butions by E. E. Cummings, Robert
Penn Warren, Cleanth Brooks, Rich-
ard Eberhart, and other representa-
tives of contemporary literature.

The saddest thing about such a film}

nar in socialism could go back to the earliest socialist writings
after the French revolution, and follow their development as
far as possible. This seminar could be offered to both political
science and history majors, and the instruction could be done
by men from both departments.

Possibilities are unlimited, of course. Putting them into
actual practice is another thing. Every department should think
in practical terms, using introspection to determine a course
which could be eliminated in order to make way for a more
worthwhile seminar. We hope that something along this line
will be considered by all departments.

Wine, Roses and Rum

They are not long, the days of wine and roses;
Out of a misty dream

Our path emerges for a while, then closes
Within a dream.

 

—Ernest Dowson

Last Thursday the enthusiasm throughout the student body |
regarding this past weekend was at high pitch. It was so high,
in fact, that the local ABC store ran out of Bacardi Light Rum
Friday afternoon and Gilby’s Gin Saturday afternoon. Yet
the weekend can be termed a qualified success at best.

This year has proved two things: rock-and-roll entertainers
are at least relatively unreliable, and they are somewhat less
than satisfactory when they perform at a school-wide concert.
No one needs to be reminded of Clyde McPhatter’s absence
Friday night of openings, or of Frank Young’s decision the
following night that the Coaster’s were not fit to perform. Last
Saturday night Bo Diddley did not arrive until 9:15, 45 min-
utes before he went on stage.

These things put premature gray hairs in the heads of
Dance Board Presidents. Most of the problems this year have
been caused by rock-and-roll musicians, who were hired be-
cause a poll of the Student Body last spring indicated that this
type of music had top preferment.

Though we do not rule out a rock-and-roll weekend as a
potentially entertaining one, we believe that it was overdone

Fancy Dress Ball, for example, was one of the most successful
concerts in the past five years. The big band, and the person-
ality of its leader, plus the experience of performing for large
crowds, made the concert the success it was.

Rock-and-roll music, in order to be fully enjoyed, must or-
dinarily be in a smaller room than Doremus Gymnasium,
and have as its partners some form of alcohol and room to
dance. Fraternity houses supply this type of entertainment in
abundance all year long.

To call the groups that performed at the Saturday Concert
“entertainers” would be a euphemism of the first degree.
Both the Isley Bfothers and Bo Diddley have made their repu-
tations on the basis of one hit, and have done little to substan-
tiate admiration since. “Shout” was old last year. More import-
ant, neither group seemed to feel that they had to exert them-
selves to divert the audience.

Diddley was especially lacking; where the Isley Brothers
were incapable of doing a good job, he was frankly unwilling
and even insulting. Remember that the twenty-five dollars
that you shelled out last September goes to pay for just a
few seconds of one performance—those seconds, perhaps, that
Bo Diddley took to leer at you while he was trying to decide
what to play next.

We have some suggestions. There are entertainers who do
entertain, who look upon entertaining as their profession and
who take the time to work up a show that will keep the atten-
tion of the audience. Golden slacks are no substitute for this.

There are also many good groups which are new and which
try hard to win approval on their way to the top. The Journey-
men are a good example of this—their performance was un-
doubtedly the best received of the weekend. This is especially
true of many folk groups, such as Ian and Sylvia, and blues
singers such as the Mose Allison Trio. Though they do not
have big names, they are very likely to provide a good concert
because they want to be liked.

It would also be a good idea to try different types of en-
tertainment. One of the “New Wave” comedians, such as
Shelly Berman or Mort Sahl would certainly be a welcome
change. The success of the Dave Brubeck concert last Fancy
Dress indicates a desire for more modern jazz concerts.

The poll last year was a good idea, and its results directed
many of Frank Young’s decisions this year. If the student body
is tired of rock-and-roll concerts as it seemed to be on Saturday
night, the results of a new poll would prove it. We strongly
support a change of pace. These days of wine, roses and rum
do not last long, and it would be a shame to see part of them
wasted watching performances such as those of the Isley Broth-

ers and Bo Diddley last Saturday.

 

 

lished ones is about even because the |
‘known ones, though consistently |
| good, are hard to get.”

Speoking of the relationship be-
tween the magazine and undergrad-
uates, Mr. Boatwright says that
“there should not be, nor is there,
any significant —connection.. You |
simply cannot combine undergradu-
ate work with the work of the writ-
ers we publish. Of course, a campus
needs a student literary magazine
and this campus has a very good
one—John Refo has done a very
good job with Ariel.”

Recent Editions

The last edition of Shenandoah
| was designed as a tribute to John

the ‘mass media’ that America is de-
luged by.’

The “little magazines” are also the |
meinstey of poetry, which has very
little representation in larger a’
zines. The Shenandoah has published!
some of America’s and England's
best-known poets in the past year,
including Howard Nemerov, William
Meredith, Roy Fuller, Richard Eber-

Dear Sir: Indeed, if such

It is the purpose of this letter to
attempt to clear up something that
has unfortunately been spread
throughout the student body. One
small minority of the non-fraternity
students has organized, held meet-
ings, and through this action has
made the claim that they represent
the entire non-fraternity enrollment
of Washington and Lee. In this fal-
lacious capacity they have gone so
far as to endorse, in the name of

and their company.
a union was formed, they would not
be our leaders. To say that the In-
dependent Union (my but I feel im-
portant with the new name they’ve
given me! But a trash can by any
other name is still a trash can), en-
dorses a certain candidate or candi-
dates is utter nonsense.

Many of us support the other
party, and will continue to do so.
It is my hope that the megalomania
of a few students will not poison the

Washington and Lee’s promising
lacrosse team, led by a fine trio of
midfielders, romped to a 9-3 decision
over Duke here Saturday. Johnny

to the Blue Devils that, “the

dled study of man’s inability to
communicate with others. He is a
master of composition; and in this
movie and “La Notte (The Night)
he establishes an expert style. A
style which is slow and careful; a
style filled with both wit and melan-
choly; a style that is superbly suited
to his subject.

His actress, Monica Vitti, gives a
performance that completely opens
her character for examination. This
is too good a film to miss. But you
;must be willing to accept a film
| with little action and studied move-
'ment. It is not a fast action film.
|It is a meticulous work of art,
though possibly for a limited audi-
lence of film enthusians.

 

Several persons have questioned
/me about placing “Lolita” so high
on my list of the year’s best films.
I believe I ranked it second. (Just
to show you how silly these lists are,
|I would now list it first. It’s like
|the Associated Press trying to de-
| cide between Cincinnati and Duke,
when Loyola is the best team of the
three. It’s merely an_ interesting
game tht we all enjoy playing.) But
to defend “Lolita” would take at
least a full column.

Claims ‘Lolita’ No. 1 In 1962;
Praise ‘L’ Adventura’ At Lyric Now

|

I will briefly say that there was|
an aura of sophistication about the
film which was unparalleled in my |
viewing. I laughed more during}
“Lolita” than in any other two-hour |
period in my whole life. Add to these |
facts that James Mason gave one of |
the finest portrayals in cinema his- |
tory as Humbert, that the support- |
ing cast was particularly excellent, |
and that Nelson Riddle’s music was |
nearly as clever as Stanley Kubrick's |
direction, and you begin to under-|
stand my enthusiasm. |

Praise From Many Critics

If what you want is support for}
my opinion, then ask some profes- |
sors who are movie buffs or read |
Esquire, New Republic, Newsweek, |
Saturday Review, or Sight and |
Sound, I am not alone in my praise. |

CHEQUES. Norwegians know them as well as
