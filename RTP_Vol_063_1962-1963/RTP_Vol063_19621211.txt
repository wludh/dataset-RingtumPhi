Proposals

Modified Plan Approved

At the regular monthly meeting
of the faculty yesterday a resolu-

tion regarding hour quizzes during}.

the last week of classes before final
exams was passed.

The Statement to the Tuesday
Edition of The Ring-tum Phi reads
as follows: “The faculty of Washing-
ton and Lee recognizes the difficul-
ties confronting students whose ex-
aminations fall heavily in the early
part of the examination period; it
urges as one means of alleviating
these difficulties, that individual
members of the faculty try to avoid
scheduling hour quizzes during the
final week of classes in this semester;
and, as an expression of its sympa-
thy with the spirit of the proposals
made by the editors of The Ring-
tum Phi, it requests the Committee
on Courses and Degrees to consider
further and more permanent means
of meeting the difficulties which
prompted these proposals.”

Action Is Result of Editorial

This recommendation is the result
of an editorial in this edition which
pointed out the hardship felt by
many students whose exam sched-
ules were disadvantageously ar-
ranged. The first proposal set forth
in the editorial was that hour quiz-
zes during the week before ebams
be eliminated. It is important to note
that the faculty felt that this pro-
posal was justified enough to “urge”
professors not to have quizzes during
that week. At this late date, its im-
possible to alter the quizzes already
set by some professors for the last
week, however, and so the recom-
mendation cannot necessarily be
complied with by all the members
of the faculty.

It is important also to note that
the matter has been referred to the
Committee on Courses and Degrees
for further consideration, This com-
mittee will investigate a permanent
means of meeting the problems by
our current examination schedule,
and hopefully will be able to pre-
sent a solution for the coming spring
semester.

IFC Adopts 63
Rush Schedule

A new 1962 Rush
Week was presented at the IFC
meeting last night. The schedule
was worked out by IFC Rush Chair-
man Tony Schlesinger and members
of the faculty.

The

schedule for

schedule

calls for moving
Freshman Camp up one day and
rushing the dorms on Thursday

night instead of Friday. The change
was made because of an increased
number of placement tests and also
beeause of the confusion of trying
to have shortened classes on the first
day.

Other Facets Unchanged

There will be the usual seventeen
rush dates with the last one ending
at 11:15 on Wednesday night, and
freshmen will still pick up bids
on Friday afternoon and confirm
on Friday night.

The IFC will again participate in
the annual Rockbridge Christmas
Basket. Larry Meeks is chairman of
this project, one of three IFC com-
munity projects, the other two being

the Blood Drive and the Charity
Chest.
The Christmas Basket program

provides over 325 families in Rock-
bridge County with baskets of food
and toys. Funds and food are raised
for the project through letters, a
children’s movie and boxes placed
in food stores.

Welfare Program Underway
Contributions from Washington
and Lee students through the fra-
ternaties provide over one-third of
the funds for this community pro-
ject. The policy of the IFC is for
each member of each house to con-
tribute one dollar to the program.

Forty-Two Booths Installed

 

 

Language Labs Near Completion

The language departments have,

completed installation of the neces-
sary equipment in duPont 102 for
a new language laboratory to be
put into use shortly.

Forty-two language booths have
been erected in duPont; twenty-two
of these are provided with tape re-
corders capable of transmitting and
receiving and twenty are receiving
booths only. Equipment for pro-
jecting slides and showing movies is
also available in the new lab.
Furthermore, there is a variety of
possibilities for the adaptation of
many other teaching aids to the
laboratory.

Planned Use of the Lab

Dr. Linton L. Barrett, head of the
Spanish Department, emphasized
that the lab would be utilized in
large part by students in language
courses involving the spoken lan-
guage. At first, it will supplement
higher, conversational courses whose
class memberships are not too large.

For the rest of the semester, Bar-
rett said, the use of the lab will be
limited. Full use of the language

Alumnus Runs Up
$75 Library Fine

By SHANNON JUNG
Cyrus McCormick has recently in-
tercepted a flagrant violator of the
two week rule on borrowed books.
Mr. O. W. Riegel, head of the
Journalism Department, last week
received a letter from an alumnus
who reported that he had failed to
return a book. The book in question
had been mising from the Journal-
ism Department library for some
time. An approximate guess esti-
mates the date due as “about 1954.”
Apparently interest in the psycho-
logical implications of gossip has de-
creased, for the book entitled The

| Psychology of Rumor has been miss-

ing for only eight years.
Fine of $74

The alumnus, in returning the
book, wrote that he believes the
fine on the book to be $58.63. Mr.
Riegel wrote back that the fine has
gone up and that he actually owes
about $65. Mr. Coleman, head li-
brarian totalled up the fine himself
and arrived at the figure of $74.67.

No report on the interest which
the alumnus has in gossip columns
or other rumor sheets was available.

No Comment from Library

When asked if the fine was re-
ceived and, if so, how it would af-
fect the financial standing of the
library, all Mr. Coleman would
answer was, “No comment.”

The alumnus, preferring to remain
anonymous, failed to give a return
address.

 

lab will begin next semester, to al-
low the language professors time
to become familiar with the opera-
tion of the equipment in the lab.

The idea of a language laboratory
is not a novel one at Washington
and Lee. In 1958, the father of a
Russian student, realizing the con-
tribution of such a lab to the fluency
of the spoken language, donated
some money for the establishment
of a lab.

Conversion of duPont

Dr. Pusey, head of the Russian
Department, then contracted with
Lee Hartman and Sons Company f
Roanoke to set up a master control
board and receiving booths. The
same company which set up that
former lab has also installed this one.

The Language department has

W&L Debaters
In Dixie Meet

Bill Noell won two speaking
awards last wekend as he and Ed
Norton represented Washington and
Lee in the Dixie Classic Debate
Tournament at Wake Forest.

Noell won awards of excellence
in debate and in extemporaneous
speaking in a tournament which was
termed “extremely powerful” by
W&L coach W. W. Chaffin.

The W&L team defeated
Indies, Western Michigan, and
George Washington. They lost to
the tournament winner, Wayne
State; to Boston College; and to
debate powerhouse Southern Illinois.

Debate Both Sides

In this tournament the pair de-|

bated both sides of the question in
alternate rounds. There were
schools entered in the two-man di-
vision, including, in addition to
those met by W&L, Holy
Fordham, Wheaton, and Vermont.

Noell Speaks on Castro

As an extemporaneous topic, Noell |
Prob- |

drew “Castro: Khrushchev’s
lem Child.” His speech on Castro's
relations with Soviet Russia
cluded three main points to prove

Khrushchev’s difficulty in dealing
with Castro. The University Christian Association’s annual Christmas Candlelight

realized the need for a lab for
some years. however, the major dif-
faculty in establishing such a teach-
ing aid was primarily financial.
Due largely to President Cole’s in-
terest and concern in this project,
this difficulty has been overcome
and the language lab is now a reali-
ty. Doctors Drake, Turner, L. L.
Barrett, and Westbrook Barritt have
also been instrumental in promot-
ing this project.
Advantages of Equipment

In the new lab, the language in-
structor can hear the recitation of
any one student at any booth. He
can also transmit to any booth sing-
ly or to the whole group collec-
tively. A meter on the master con-
trol board will show him wheather
each person is participating or not.

The lab will demand increased
time from each professor, but Bar-
rett says that the extra demands
will be well worth the effort. He
went on to say that the whole
language department is convinced of
the potential effectivenes of this
new aid.

Cit Petition
Endorsed By
820 Students

By LARRY MEEKS

Almost 80 per cent of the members
of the undergraduate student body
have signed the petition for a more
liberal cut system, according to John
Kirkley. The petition contains 820
signatures out of 1039 undergradu-
ate students here at W&L, and all
of the petitions are still not in. No
law students’ signatures are on the

—y

petitions, as they would not be
effected by any new ruling that

might result.
Executive Committee Acts

According to Student Body Pres-
ident Tim Ireland, the Executive
Committee unanimously approved
the idea of a more liberal cut sys-
tem and appointed a subcommittee
to help Kirkley present the peti-
tions to the faculty in its meeting
last night.

The petition reads, “We the under-
signed students of Washington and
Lee University, have come ‘to feel
that the present system of absence
regulations is too strict and should
be abolished in favor of a new,
more liberal system, constructed
around the outline given below.

Burden of Responsibility

“We know that such a_ system
would place on each of us as indi-
vidual students the burden of great-
er freedom, yet we believe that we
will meet the challenge with greater
responsibility if given this oppor-
tunity to exercise our maturity and
judgment.”

The petition then outlines a pro-
posed system, calling for unlimited
cuts, except before and after the
holidays, for all upperclassmen with
an average of 1.00 or better and one
week of cuts for upperclassmen with
an average below 1.00. For fresh-
men, a 2.00 first semester would be
required for unlimited cuts.

fraternity which was founded at

kKW&L in 1914 selected 12 seniors, 3
juniors, and 5 law students at the
noon-hour assembly. Presiding at
the convocation was Meade Chris-
tian, president of the W&L chapter
of ODK. Christian announced that
the 1964 national convention of the
fraternity will be held at W&L.

ODK membership is extended only
to students who have made signi-
ficant contributions in the fields of
scholarship, athletics, publications,
social and religious affairs, speech,
music and the dramatic arts.

Says Present Era Golden Age

In his speech Dr. Haskins, Presi-
dent of the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, called “profound intel-
lectual revolution” an integral char-
acteristic of our time” and said that
the present period of history “may
one day achieve the title of a Gold-
en Age.”

A new Golden Age, said Haskins,
“will necessarily be deeply concern-
ed with the practical aspects of
the conquest of power from Nature.”
The tremendous challenge offered to
man will create a partnership of “vi-
tality with anxeity and turbulence,”
a characteristic in which “our own
times must superbly qualify as a
Golden Age.”

A “grand revolution in our ways
of looking at the world,” said Has-
kins, “is full upon us—a revolution
which in its power and its scope,
indeed, vividly recalls the explosive
qualities of Copernican times. We
are living,” he added, during a tre-
mendous shift in scientific philoso-
phy,” based on “changes in funda-
mental concepts.”

“‘Absolutes’ And The Honor System

On this page today, we have printed an in-
teview with Dr. Louis Hodges, in which Dr.
Hodges questions the concepts which form
the basis of the Washington and Lee Honor
System. We have printed the article because
we have a very genuine respect for Dr.
Hodges’ opinions; we disagree with him, how-
ever, and would like to express our own opin-
ions on the subject in this editorial.

Dr. Hodges states that the Honor System
here is “operated on the premise that honor
is, in fact, an absolute... .” This assumption,
we believe, is an erroneous one. The Honor
System makes no atempt to define absolute
honor, nor does it require that every W&L
man be a completely honorable man. Like
Dr. Hodges, we doubt the existence of the
completely honorable man, and we would
be hard put to describe an absolute concept of
honor.

If the Honor System does not describe
what honor is, what then does it do? Simply
this: it describes what honor is not. It states,
in no uncertain terms, what an honorable man
does not do: he does not lie, cheat, or steal.
The Honor System assumes that lying, cheat-
ing, and stealing are basically wrong, and that
no combination of biological and psychological
idiosyncrasies can make one of these three acts
honorable.

Strictly speaking, however, it is the stu-
dent body, and not the “Honor System,”
which makes the above assumption. The dis-
tinctive characteristic of the Washington and
Lee Honor System, as compared with other
systems that the bear the same name, is that
to an unparalleled degree it is an Honor Sys-
tem that works. And why does it work? Simp-
ly because the students who choose to attend
W&L subscribe to the tenets of the Honor
System, and these students are not willing to
condone the presence of those who don’t.
If there is an “absolute” in our Honor System,
it is this: for well over a century, and despite
variations and changes in concepts of honor,
the student body at Washington and Lee has
been in almost unanimous agreement that
there is no concept of honor which would in-
clude, or even consider as “relative,” the right
to lie, cheat, or steal.

It follows that, if there is nothing rela-
tive about lying, cheating, and stealing, then

there can be nothing relative about the pen-
alty. If considered from a discplinary or legal
standpoint, the penalty for a violation of the
Honor System is quite often out of all propor-
tion to the actual act. But the Honor System
is not a disciplinary or legal system. Discipli-
nary systems simply demand obedience. An
Honor System demands more—it demands a
high standard of integrity, and it offers to
those who observe this standard innumerable
benefits and privileges which can never be
realized within the confines of a legal system.

When we speak of benefits and privileges,
we are not indulging in meaningless rhetoric:
the benefits of the Honor System are innum-
erable, and anyone who has ever been con-
nected with Washington and Lee will affirm
this statement. These benefits are not to be
taken for granted: their existence depends
entirely on the integrity of each member of
the student body. The individual who fails
to maintain this standard of integrity threatens
the entire system and jeopardizes the privi-
leges of others. To punish such a student with
any penalty less than withdrawal is, in effect,
to excuse his first offense, and to excuse the
first offense is to compromise our own stand-
ards. This compromise, as exemplified at
other institutions, can lead to a mockery of
the Honor System.

No one can claim that any effort is left
unsought to make every student who comes
to this campus aware of what the Honor Sys-
tem is and what it demands. This effort be-
gins in the first approach to him in his secon-
dary school; it is perhaps the single most im-
portant emphasis in all of his orientation, at
Freshman Camp, in subsequent campus meet-
ings, in dorm counselor sessions, in contact
with upper classmen. It is not too much to ask
this question: if a man is so weak as to fail in
the most important requirement that he is
asked to offer here—after every possible effort
has been made to have him become a partici-
pating member of the Washington and Lee
way of life— is not his elimination a justifiable
price to pay for the atmosphere of Honor
which other men of Washington and Lee have
enjoyed for generations, which we enjoy to-
day, and which it is our obligation to preserve
for generations to come?

‘Dishonorable Not To Lie’

 

By DON CASTO
look in June exactly like it did in
1883.

According to Grounds and Build-
ings Superintendent, Douglas Brady,
the intensive work being done on
Lee Chapel is designed not to re-
model but to restore. He said that
workers have encountered a great
many problems in restoration that
would not have normally been en-
countered in remodeling.

The wood flooring and paneling,
for instance, is not being changed.
Every piece of wood has been care-
fully removed, numbered, and stored.
Each piece will be replaced in its
original position after being treated
against decay.

Rotten Wood

It would have been less expensive
and less trouble, Brady said, merely
to use new materials. Some of the
wood had rotted, and this not only
creates a greater expense but also
makes the job of putting it back into
position after restoration “inealcul-
ably more delicate and difficult.”

Brady said a special effort is being
made to duplicate the original color
scheme of the Chapel’s interior. This
is difficult in that no one seems to
know for sure just what the origi-
nal colors were.

Lighting To Be Restored

The workers are trying to dupli-
cate the original lighting and light
fixtures of the Chapel. At the begin-
ning of the restoration the fixtures
were not in their original positions.
Restoration officials are trying to
determine these positions from old
pictures and by close examination of
the building itself. Brady said that
from time to time a worker might
find a small serew hole or a slight

 

indention in the plaster to indicate

If all goes well, Lee Chapel will;

 

| that a light fixture was once there.

In general, Brady said, the object
of the restoration is not merely to
make repairs but to bring the Chapel
as close to its original state as pos-
sible.

No Exterior Changes

He said there will be no major
changes in the exterior of the
Chapel. It will appear exactly as it
was in 1883 when the Lee family
mauseleum was added. The addition
of this erypt is the only major
change that has been made in the
Chapel since its construction in 1867.
Brady said that the only interior
changes have been slight one, such
as the lighting and the painting.

Many unexpected problems arose
in the renovation.

Unexpected Delay

The wooden beams which support-
ed the roof had to be removed to
make way for more structurally
sound steel beams. The contractor
was afraid that the steeple and the
walls of the building would lose
support and might be damaged when
the beams were removed.

Consequently, the steeple

Painstaking Attention To Detail

girdled with beams to keep it from
collapsing. This resulted in an un-
expected and costly delay.

Brady mentioned that a big prob-
lem was the fact that a number of
architects are being employed at a
significant cost while the only real
architectural work necessary is in
making a few structural changes.

Building Fireproofed

Brady said many of the changes
will not be readily noticeable.

The entire building, for instance,
is being fireproofed. A new con-
crete floor between the basement
museum and the Chapel will serve
as a fire stop should a fire break out
in either section.

The renovated building will be
be equipped with air-conditioning
which will serve not only to make
those in the building more comfort-
able but also to better preserve the
delicate and decay-prone artifacts
and paintings.

Very Little Decay

Brady said the Chapel was in bet-
ter condition than expected. Experts
had thought the timbers would be
decaying, but the primary damage
they found was some insignificant
boring by post beetles. There was
surprisingly little termite damage
and almost. no serious structural
flaws. The brickwork and masonary
was also in excellent condition,
Brady said, and needed very little
renovation.

In summation, the object of the
restoration is to bring Lee Chapel
as close to its original state, both
structurally and physically, as pos-
sible.

When it is finished in May, Lee
Chapel will look exactly as it did in
1883—and will be just as sturdy as
it was then.

 

The Honor System: Is It Based on a Moral Myth?

Honor: Is it an absolute ideal?

Dr. Louis Hodges doesn't think so.

In an interview with a Ring-tum
Phi reporter last week, Religion
Professor Hodges sad that honor is
“quite certainly a relative matter.”

“While there is no doubt in any-
one’s mind that we would all agree
on obvious breaches of lying, steal-
ing or cheating, disagreement is
bound to rise on the finer points of
honor.

stanees it would be quite dishonor-

Explaining, he continued:

“If honor were not relative, there
would be no possibility for disagee-

Disputes Not Possible

“Assuming that every member of
the EC had an equal knowledge
of the facts in any given case, then
it would logically follow that dis-

were absolute.

“But allowance is made for diverse
interpretations of the same facts in

He next commented on the Honor

“The word system,” he said “sug-

“The word honor, on the other

Undefeated Wrestlers Score Four Pins, Rip Pfeiffer, 26-6

W &L Cagers Seek
First Home Win

Against

King Five

Washington and Lee’s basketball team seeks its second win

of the young season tonight at 8 p.m. when it entertains King

College of Bristol.

King represents a tough barrier in*
the injury-plagued Generals’ path
The Bristol boys bowed to a strong
Roanoke College quintet, 73-70, last
week and have scored over 100}
points twice in posting victories.

Washington and Lee, led by super-
star Rodger Fauber, brings a 1-3)
record into the contest.

The Generals lost two games on
a weekend road trip to Old Dominion
College and Randolph-Macon Col-
lege.

Old Dominion pushed their two-
year winning string to 14 games
with a 73-64 triumph Friday night
and Randolph-Macon cruised to a}
76-58 victory after some tough!
early going Saturday night .

At Norfolk, Old Dominion crept|
into a 33-28 halftime lead, but the
Generals remained within striking
distance until 8:00 remained in the
game, when the Monarchs opened
up a ten point margin.

Fauber, hitting seven of ten shots
from the floor paced the Generals’
second half surge. The Lynchburg
senior wound up with 23 points for
the game.

Old Dominion last lost a game
when the Generals whipped them
at W&L midway through the 1961-62
season.

Washington and Lee sank 29 of
63 shots from the floor against the
Monarchs for 46 per cent. Old
Dominion hit 30 for 78 for 38.2 per
cent.

The taller Monarchs outrebounded
the Generals, 53-42, and thus gained
the upper hand in the game.

burly 6-2, 190-pounder, was the
conference total offense leader with
league leading rushing and passing
marks of 538 yard: on 119 carries
and 501 yards on 37 pass completions
from 87 attempts. He hit on four
scoring passes.

Centre’s Bob Hourigan was a
triple-threat quarterback who hurt
opponents with his passing running,
and effective ball handling. He also
was the conference punting leader
averaging 33.8 yards a kick.

Gaining pins in the
final two matches, Washington and
Lee’s wrestling team rolled to a 26-
6 victory over Pfeiffer College here
Saturday night.

Sophomore Butch West wasted no
time in giving the Generals a 5-0
lead in their quest for a_ third
straight win without a loss. West
took his opponent, Charles Dickin-
son, down and pinned him in 1:47 of
the first period.

Senior tri-captain Dave Mont-
gomery, in the 130-pound weight
class, upped the W&L lead to 10-0
when he pinned Larry Crubley at
0:36 into the second period.

Pfeiffer earned its six points in
the 137 and 157 classes.

Arthur Merrion scored a
down and a reversal to take
lead into the third period against
freshman Jerry Reeves, but Reeves
gave Merrion a run for his money,
scoring a reversal, an escape, and
a take down in the final three min-
utes. Merrion’s final margin
