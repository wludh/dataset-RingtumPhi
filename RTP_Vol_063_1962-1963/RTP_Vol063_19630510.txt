Democrats
Form Club

A Young Democrats Club has
been organized at Washington and
Lee and has obtained a charter from
the national Democratic organization
within the past few weeks.

Al Eckes, junior, is president of
the new club, which has held three
meetings to date.

Other officers are Steve Smith,
vice president; Sam Frazier, sec-
retary; and Mike Hayslip, treasurer.
All are charter members of the W&L
Young Democrats.

The new group is expected, ac-
cording to its members, to give
some competition to the strong
Washington and Lee Young Repub-
lican outfit.

Formation of this club practically
completes the political picture at
W&L, since there were last year
the Young Republicans and the Con-
servative Society, and this year has
seen ‘the start of a Non-Conservative
group of more liberal students.

The Young Democrats, says Eckes,
are not at the present time taking
cither a conservative or a_ liberal
stand, due to the fact that their
membership represents many
streams of political thought. The
W&L Young Republicans have been
markedly conservative, and conser-
vatism has seemed to be the strong-
est political feeling at the university
in recent years.

A committee of the club is now
at work to propose a_ constitution
to guide future clubs. Pete Straub,
a law student, is chairman of the
constitutional committee.

Eckes announced that anyone
wishing to join or obtain informa-
tion concerning the Young Demo-
crats, should see him or one of the
other officers. The charter member-

 

ship of the organization is 20.

Two Named Fulbright Scholars,
Both Plan To Study In Germany

By STEVE CASE
Associate Editor |

Two W&L seniors, Jim Campbell |
and John Refo, have recently been
awarded scholarships for the gradu-
ate study abroad under the Fulbright
Program, of which Dr. C. W. Turner
is the University advisor. Both stu-
dents will study in Germany next
winter, following an eight week ori-
entation course.

Jim Campbell, from St. Petersburg,
Florida, will study at the University
of Erlange. Jim is a Dean’s List
student and has held the Elizabeth

torate in English and American lit-
erature at Columbia University, and
he has been on the Johns Hopkins
faculty since 1941.

Distinguished Author
Dr. Anderson is a distinguished
ing written a number of books con-
cerning American authors. Included
in his works are: Journal of a Cruise
in the Frigate United States, Mel-
ville in the South Seas, and Emily
Dickinson's Poetry: Stairway of
Surprise. He is also the editor of
the 10-volume Centennial Edition of
Sidney Lanier and is presently work-
ing on studies of Thoreau and Henry
James.

 

B. Garrett Scholarship for attain-
ments in French. He is a member

the Graham-Lee Literary Society,
and is a candidate for Honors in
German.

His work in Germany will be a
continuation of that on his Honors
Thesis, which is about the German
novelist Gustav Meyrink. He also
plans to study the Romantic Period
of German Literature in general to
add to his knowledge of Meyrink’s
literary background and to see how
that novelist’s concerns are reflected
in the work of other writers of the
time. After his stay in Germany
Jim plans to work for his Doctor-
ate at UNC.

Refo will study at the Uni-
of Bohn. John is a member
Eta Sigma, and Phi Beta
Kappa, and has held several schol-
arships, including a Robert E. Lee
Scholarship. In addition, he has been
president of his fraternity, is the

Footnote To Recent Dispute:
Don’t Let Issue Be Clouded

The “tooth and nail” controversy over a recent Honor
System proposal has been a refreshing change from the dull
routine of normalcy and we would like to extend our apprecia-
tion to Mr. Lamb and those who have supported him. They are
helping to fill a very real and noxious vacuum on our campus,
a vacuum which develops when too many people think alike.

As you are well aware, apathy and conformity have always
been a proverbial plague on our little community, and for this
reason we welcome those who have minds of their own. We can
do ourselves no greater harm than to discourage such people.
For criticism and divergence of opinion are healthy anywhere;
for a successful university, they are absolutely essential. This
is especially true when we realize that traditions and values
at W&L are never so fully appreciated as when they are
challenged.

Finally, a word of caution. We trust that no student will per-
mit the tactlessness which certain members of the EC have
recently displayed detract from the stand which they have
taken. Their argument is a strong one and the fervor with which
they are resisting opposition may in the eyes of province be
justifiable.

Where the EC went wrong was in appearing to suppress a
student’s honest opinion. The point is now obvious. Where
you the reader can make an equally drastic mistake is to let
this error prejudice your thinking on the issue at hand. Our
Honor System has served more than any other asset we have
to make this institution the outstanding university it is today.
Consider what is at stake when there is talk of making changes;
on such a critical matter, you can not allow mere whim to in-
fluence your decision, regardless of which side of the issue you
take.

Debate Over Honor System
Shouldn’t Involve Personalities

Dr. Sydney M. B. Coulling wrote in the Ring-tum Phi last
year that “there is a difference between an examination of the
honor system that is useful and an examination of it that is not,
and it has seemed to me that we have not always observed this
distinction.” The present argument over the honor system has,
clearly, grossly neglected this distinction and has devolved from
issues to unwarranted personal attack.

In the Friday Ring-tum Phi an editorial entitled “A La-
ment” charged that the W&L EC has been “burying their
heads in the proverbial sand,” that they “have never seriously
considered the suggestion which they have rejected” (i.e., the
proposal to change the penalty for honor system violations) .
It concluded by saying that ‘“This is sad, for blind men are very
sad indeed.” The accusation that the EC is blind and pre-
judiced, that it has “missed the point of Lamar Lamb’s proposal
altogether,” would be a very serious one—if it could be taken
seriously. It is hard to see how the very writers of the editorial
could take such an idea seriously. It is preposterous to suppose
that the EC hasn’t critically thought about the honor system.
It is even more absurd to suppose that those who disagree with
Lamb’s proposal are “blind” or “unable,” as the editorial
states.

The “Lament” went beyond its accusation of the EC to
attack Lanny Butler personally, stating that he attempted to
remove from the Ring-tum Phi an editorial endorsing the pro-
posed change, which is true. However, Butler acted in his right
as editor of the writers of the editorial, who had been members
of Butler’s Tuesday staff all year, who will be on the Tuesday
staff next year, and who had previously agreed to make edi-
torial policy amenable to Butler’s own views for the remainder
of this year. The “Lament” charges that Butler tried to “‘sup-
press discussion of Lamb’s proposal,” which is false; Butler did
not try to stifle the idea, he tried to keep it from appearing as
editorial policy and would have welcomed its appearance as an
article or letter.

Next it was lamented that Butler tried to have Lamb
removed from the slate of Progressive Party candidates. Every
person who was present at the Progressive clique meeting at
which the proposal was discussed, knows that this statement is
totally false.

Controversy around individuals is dangerous when it is
involved in such a debate as that over the honor system.
If the debate cannot be kept free of what Dr. Coulling calls
“unhelpful criticism,” that which “obscures rather than illumi-
nates,” it ought to be ended.

Student Clarifies Recent Controversy at Corner Grill

The Editor
Dear Sir,

Due to a series of stories told
about my controversy with the pro-
prietor of Corner Grill I would ap-
preciate your publishing this in
order for me to clarify what has
taken place.

Some two weeks ago I was stand-
ing across the street from Corner
Grill talking to two Negro high
school students. The proprietor on
this occasion went to a W&L student
in this establishment and told him
to tell me I should not stand outside
there talking to these Negroes be-
cause a thing like that was not done
around here, and that I should go
some place else.

Another incident occurred after
another foreign student and I were
seen talking to the waitresses in
Corner Grill, both inside and out-
side this establishment. An elderly,
white woman standing by the cash
register said to us while we were
paying her: “You two guys are not
fooling anyone—we know what you
are up to. Just watch your steps!”

Remarks like these are not pleas-
ant ones and the following day I
went to Corner Grill and asked one
of the waitresses if she thought they
would meet any repercussion if we,
the foreign students, told the pro-
prietor how we felt about this. This
waitress had heard what had been
said and was very excited over it.
While she was talking, the proprietor
came by a couple of times and then
told her to get away and stand
somewhere else behind the counter.
An argument between the two fol-
lowed, the proprietor came up to me
and told me to get out and stay
out.

Being a guest in this country, I feel
that I should not demonstrate my
opinion on the racial question. Deep
feelings of human rights and _tra-
dition are involved and I should not
impose upon you my views as I
come from a foreign country. But.
I feel that there is a borderline be-
tween what are my duties as a guest
and what behavior I can justify
to myself. I would fail myself as a
person and a foreign student if I
avoided a certain group of the
American people just because of
what “is done” among a majority.
Many people may dislike my talk-
ing to Negroes and my walking with
them in the street, and disdlike me
for doing these things—it is your
right to dislike what you want—
but I do not believe that I have
violated anybody’s rights or stretch-
ed my own rights through my be-

havior. Nor has this behavior
been demonstrative.
Therefore, I am not going to

change on this point. I intend to go
on associating with whomever I like.

I do not understand the behavior
we have been subject to on the
part of the management of the Cor-
ner Grill. I do not question their
legal right to tell an employee to
a customer and stand in another
place, to fire her and to throw a
customer out, but I cannot see any
justification for their behavior to-
wards a group of human being that
have chosen to associate with one
another.

Some persons associated with this
school are circulating a statement
concerning this controversy. I think
that it is important in this con-
nection to discern between the feel-
ings tht are aroused when a foreign-
er in one’s country is subject to an
extremist behavior and one’s feel-
ings towards the behavior as such.

Allow me to express my regrets
that the only article written by for-
eign students this year in the Wash-
ington and Lee School paper is one
of this kind. What has taken place
is one unpleasant experience among
so many other pleasant ones in this
country

Yours faithfully
JAN-ERIK BERG

Change In Honor System
To Come From Obligation

To the Editor

Dear Sir:

I am certainly in favor of the
proposed changes in the Honor Sys-
tem suggested by Lamar Lamb and
others; in fact, I feel so strongly
about the subject that I should fav-
or no Honor System at all over the
present administration of it.

At the same time, however, I think
it should be pointed out that, de-
spite all the talk about change,
nothing has yet been done; this
means that, as before, every member
of the student body is pledged to
uphold the Honor System as it is
presently administered. I do not
feel, as do some, that we as students
have a right to change the system;
rather, I should insist that we have

 

an obligation to do so. However, un-

 

til such changes occur, I should hope
that each student would act respon-
sibly with respect to his previous
commitment to uphold the system,
thereby enforcing present policy un-
til it is corrected. Unjust though the
law may be, we have a duty either
to uphold it until it is changed, or
else to be prepared to take the con-
sequences for violating it.

Furthermore, I should hope that
all efforts be made to see that
changes in the System are ap-
proached in a rational, orderly. fash-
ion, weighing alternatives and pos-
sible consequences. As a step in this
direction, I would suggest—to keep
down some of the difficulties that
have occurred with respect to the
present discussion—that the Execu-
tive Committee make available to the
student body all records of honor
trials and procedural changes with,
of course all names carefully de-
leted—from as far back as possible
to, say ten years ago; this should
take much of the machinery for
change out of the hands of the EC,
and put it back with the student
body where it belongs.

 

For change in the Honor System
to be effective, it must come from
the student body itself; the EC’s
chief concern should be to enforce
the policies the students themselves
adopt. This puts the burden squarely
on us as students; I hope the in-
terval in the present discussion
caused by exams and summer va-
cation will not cause an apathy or
laxity with regard to this matter.

Sincerely yours,
WILLIAM B. LOWRY, JR.

Student Lauds Jay Taylor
For Contributions To W&L

Dear Editor:

This is not a letter from an angry
man. I think it is time we recog-
nized the contributions of one pro-
fessor who has given so much to
W&L during the past year. The
professor I am referring to is Jay
Laurence Taylor.

All of us are so quick to criticize
that often positive accomplishments
escape us. Mr. Taylor is sincerely

 

 

interested in the student body; he
has done much to contribute to
our education.

Allow me to mention a few of
his accomplishments. Jay Taylor is
the originator and director of ReVue.
Recently when Dwight MacDonald
spoke here he mentioned that he
has never seen such intelligent in-
terest in the film art in any college
in the country except possibly for
Yale, and he added that the W&L
students with whom he had spoken
edged Yale students in actual ac-
quaintance with films. Certainly
much of this enthusiasm for movies
is attributed to the opportunity pro-
vided us by Mr. Taylor.

Mr. MacDonald, one of the lead-
ing movie critics in the country
(Esquire magazine), was persuaded
to come here by Mr. Taylor.

The appearance on our campus of
the noted anthologist and poet, Oscar
Williams, was another contribution
of Mr. Taylor.

Father Henri Laval, a French
Dominican priest, spent a week on
our campus under the auspices of,

Three Proposals Suggested For
Further Academic Improvement

By ROD COCKSHUTT

Washington and Lee’s progress in
the academic sphere over the past
few years has been admirable. And
yet, most of us would agree that
there is still much to be done in
helping this University realize its
goal of true excellence in academic
matters. The purpose of this column,
then, is simply to suggest some pro-
posals which, if implemented, may
be beneficial in achieving that goal.

A. Whitney Griswold, who was,
until his death a few weeks ago,
President of Yale University and

 

one of America’s most articulate
spokesman in the field of higher
education, once said that “Like
law a university is a seamless
web. Anything which helps the
freshman class helps the Uni-
versity.” The truth of this state-
ment has already been acknow-
ledged to a certain extent at
Washington and Lee in the recent
moves to upgrade and liberalize
the freshman curriculum.

Despite the fact that most profes-
sors are sincerely concerned about
the weaker students, an ever-in-

 

Presidential Chances Remote
For Romney, Scranton, Nevitt

(Following is the concluding
half of a series on the presidential
prospects for the 1964 elections.
Last week, Mr. Hyatt, an inter-
mediate law Student, discussed
Rockefeller and Goldwater.

By JAMES HYATT

Where would Rockefeller’s advo-
cates go if he were to actually bow
out of the race? Goldwater? I doubt
it. But how feasible is it to turn
to Romney, Scranton, Hatfield, or
Nevitt? George Romney, the moder-
ate conservative Governor of Mich-
igan offers very little in this writer’s
opinion. Romney did win in a state
which was controlled by Democrats
and “Big Labor” for the past 14
years. But when he put his reputa-
tion on the line over a vote on a
new state constitution, he barely
won the contest.

Specializes in Everybody

Mr. Romney is usually described
as being against big business, big
labor, and big government. He
specializes in everybody. His follow-
ers, he would hope, consist of those
who are willing to put their citizen’s
interest ahead of their private inter-
ests. Needless to say, Romney has
one “plus” factor of belonging to
a minority religion, Mormonism.
And for what it is worth, he is avid
on physical fitness. He has, however,
repeatedly denied all rumors that he
will run. But comments would lead
one to believe otherwise.

Returning to the East, Pennsyl-
vania comes into the picture with
Governor Scranton. Mr. Scranton
has a record to match Kennedy,
Rockefeller, or Goldwater, or so say
his followers. Briefly, he was a one-
term Congressman; special assistant
to Christian A. Herter; he repre-
sented the U.S. at numerous _in-
ternational conferences in Europe,
Latin America, and at U.N. during
the Eisenhower administration. Mr.
Seranton served in World War II as
a flying Captain; graduated from
Yale with a B.A. and LLB. and
happens to be a multi-millionare.
One problem stands in the way:
Seranton doesn’t want the nomina-
tion. However, he is one person to
whom Rockefeller supporters might
well flee in emergencies.

Governor Hatfield, a young man
from Oregon, might also collect some
eastern liberal votes. Hatfield is
known as an intellectual of sorts,
and he has the support of labor!
According to the April Gallop Poll,
he has 8 per cent of the potential
Republican voters on his side.

 

Arthur Nevitt

Arthur G. Nevitt is an unlikely
man for the president but he has
the qualifications. Some supporters
are considering opening campaign
headquarters but they’re not certain
which state to locate it in. Briefly,
Nevitt, who has 1/8 colored blood,
and comes from the state of Illinois,
stands to gain the Southern Negro
vote and the rabid eastern liberal
vote, due to his nebulous location.
Nevitt is a reformed Jew, after hav-
ing spent ten years in the Episcopal
faith. Before that, he was a devout
advocate of Taoism. With such a
sparkling religious past, he should
pick up millions of minority religion
voters. Nevitt, of course, comes from
a wealthy family who made their
money honestly buying up oil-satu-
rated Indian land at pre-war prices.
His family is large due to fact that
we won the custody of his first wife’s
children in divorce court. His second
wife is quite lovely and would make
a perfect “First Lady” all dressed
up in her serape.

A Strong Pragmatist

Mr .Nevitt is very strong on his
political views. This writer has never
met anyone who has matched the
zeal Nevitt displays when it comes
to foreign affairs. He proclaims that
he is a straightforward Pragmatist
who will sway either way. He be-
lieves in sending troops into Viet
Nam, maybe, and the budget should
be slashed by millions, possibly, and
that unemployment would be solved

(Continued on page 4)

 

creasing number of hours spent in
committee meetings, in addition to
the normal professorial work load,
have made the type of personal
help once available almost impos-
sible today.

It is in such a situation that stu-
dents can be of significant help.
Members of the freshman honor
society, Phi Eta Sigma, recognized
for their fine academic ability, do
practically nothing as an organi-
zation on this campus. Why not
put that untapped talent to use in
the establishment of a voluntary
student tutoring service? Much of
the time now spent out of class
by professors explaining funda-
mentals and mechanics could then
be put to other more profitable
use,

The minor details of such a system
could be worked out with little
trouble and the program could be
operable by September. Nor do we
have to restrict it to Phi Eta Sig-
mas. Other interested and qualified
students could also be employed.

A second proposal concerns sem-
inars. A recent editorial in the
Ring-tum Phi cloquently expressed
the desire of a large number of stu-
dents for more seminars especially
in certain departments where there
are either woefully few or none at
all. Perhaps a step in the right di-
rection would be the establishment
of a system where, out of every three
class periods in a particular course,
two would be straight lectures and
the other would be a seminar—dis-
cussion on the material covered
in the lectures. A program similar
to this has proved very successful
at Yale.

Naturally seminars, if done cor-
rectly, mean more work for both
students and professors, but the
educational rewards of such a sys-
tem increase proportionately.

Finally, faculty meetings ought to
be opened for the student body
through the admission of a reporter
from the Ring-tum Phi to such
meetings. Of course, the right of ex-
ecutive session must be maintained
for the discussion of confidential
matters. But through opening these
meetings, student-faculty under-
standing could possibly be greatly
increased, and the unfortunate ru-
mors which occasionally arise from
closed sessions could be eliminated.

The CAC Way

The first annual spring College Athletic Conference tour-
nament was indeed a successful event and a step in the right
direction for athletics on this campus. It was good to see a
whole weekend directed for W&L devoted to an athletic tourna-
ment of this type, involving athletes from four other schools.
The large turnout on the part of the students and townspeople
in support of our athletes was also indicative of the great suc-
cess of the weekend. Washington University of St. Louis did
extremely well here. It is a larger school than W&L and has a
fine group of athletes. Washington and Lee lost the overall
trophy by only five points and the closeness of the competition
indicates it could have easily gone the other way. Next year
when the tournament is held at Centre College in Danville,
Kentucky, the competition will be even tougher, and hopefully

WeL will be the winner.

Battling Bears Grab Track

 

By DON CASTO

Washington and Lee trackmen
finished a strong third in last Satur-
day’s CAC finals. The thinclads ac-
cumulated a total of fifty-two points
while second place Sewanee had
sixty-two and top ranking Washing-
ton Universitl had eighty-five. Al-
though the Generals only captured
two first places, they made up for
this with superior depth. Hardly an
event passed in which the Generals
did not place a man.

Tommy Edwards and Robin Kell
were the two gold medal winners
for Washington and Lee. Edwards
won the broad jump with a leap of
twenty-one feet, six and three-
quarters inches. In that same event
Henry Sackett jumped twenty-one
feet in the preliminaries to set a
new meet record. The jumps in the
finals could not be counted towards
a record because the wind was too
great. Robin Kell won his gold
medal in the triple jump as he
bounded to a new meet record of
forty-three feet, six inches. He also
placed fourth in the high jump.

Freshman Scott Kennedy placed
second close behind Kell in the
triple jump and also captured a fifth
place in the javelin throw. In other
field events Dave Britt threw the
discus one hundred thirty-two feet,
two inches to take second in that
event; and captain Dave Munroe
captured fifth. Munroe also placed
second in the shot put.

Mac Brownlee won second place
laurels in a close mile race and came
back shortly thereafter to capture a
third place in the two mile run and
a fifth in the half mile run. Andy

By JIM CROTHERS

Led by the hitting of Bob Benben
and the clutch pitching of Tom
Eckleman, and aided by eight W&L
errors, Washington University over-
whelmed Washington and Lee, 13-3
in the CAC championship baseball
game Saturday afternoon.

Benben paced the Bears’ 16-hit at-
tack with four hits and four RBIs,
while Eckleman allowed two runs
and spaced ten General hits over
eight innings. Eric Sisler led the
Washington and Lee hitters with
three safeties to end the season with
a team-leading .431 batting average.

Washington U. scored three runs
in the second inning on a W&L

three-base error with men on second |

and third, and added two more
in the fourth stanza. The Generals
then came back to make the score
5-2, but the St. Louisians put the
game out of reach with three more
tallies in their half of the fifth.

The Generals earned a berth in
the final game by downing Sewanee
Friday night, 9-3. Southpaw Chris
Wigert spaced eight Sewanee hits
and fanned eleven men to capture
his fifth win, while aiding his own
cause by driving in three tallies.

With the game tied, 2-2, in the
fifth, the Generals unloaded with
six runs. Aside from Wigert’s key
hit during this rally, Howie Martin
and Ashley Allen also singled and
later scored.

In the opening tournament game,
Sewanee scored two key runs in
the eighth inning to edge Southwest-
ern, 8-6. Al Sherer picked up the
win in relief as Frank Stubblefield
led the Southerner’s attack with
two hits and three RBI’s.

Southwestern came back in the
semi-final game to top Sewanee,
9-4, for third place in the final base-
ball standings. The Lynx went
ahead 5-3 with two runs in the sec-
ond inning and were never in trouble
again.

Third baseman Fritz Anthon hit
two home-runs to drive in all six of
Washington University runs, as the
Bears downed Centre College Fri-

day, 6-4. Although outhit 10-7,
Washington U. managed to bunch
its hits, and Ron Zetcher, Bear

hurler, pitched fine clutch baseball
to gain a berth in the final game.

Not only did Washington Univer-

but the Bears also placed four of

team based on play in the recent
tournament. Washington and Lee
landed three spots on the team

Contre, Southwestern, and Sewanee,
landing one berth apiece.

General pitching and hitting star
Chris Wigert was the only unani-

chosen.

TILL WE MEET AGAIN

With today’ s installment I complete my ninth year of writing
columns in your college newspaper for the makers of Marlboro
Cigarettes. In view of the occasion, I hope I may be forgiven
if I get a little misty.

These nine years have passed like nine minutes. In fact,
I would not believe that so much time has gone by except that
I have my wife nearby as a handy reference. When I started
columning for Marlboros, she was a slip of a girl—supple as a
reed and fair as the sunrise. Today she is gnarled, lumpy, and
given to biting the postman. Still, I count myself lucky. Most
of my friends who were married at the same time have wives
who chase cars all day. I myself have never had this trouble
and I attribute my good fortune to the fact that I have never
struck my wife with my hand. I have always used a folded

newspaper—even throughout the prolonged newspaper strike
in New York. During this period I had the airmail edition of
the Manchester Guardian flown in daily from England. I must
confess, however, that it was not entirely satisfactory. The air-
mail edition of the Guardian is printed on paper so light and
flimsy that it makes little or no impression when one slaps one’s
wife. Mine, in fact, thought it was some kind of game, and tore
several pairs of my trousers.

But I digress. I was saying what a pleasure it has been to
write this column for the last nine years for the makers of
Marlboro Cigarettes—a fine group of men, as anyone who has
sampled their wares would suspect. They are as mellow as the
aged tobaccos they blend. They are as pure as the white cellulose
filter they have devised. They are loyal, true, companionable,
and constant, and I have never for an instant wavered in my
belief that some day they will pay me for these last nine years.

Sut working for the makers of Marlboro has not been the
greatest of my pleasures over the last nine years. The chief
satisfaction has been writing for you—the college population
of America. It is a rare and lucky columnist who can find an
audience so full of intelligence and verve. I would like very
much to show my appreciation by asking you all over to my
house for tea and oatmeal cookies, but there is no telling how
many of you my wife would bite.

For many of you this is the last year of coilege. This is espe-
cially true for seniors. To those I extend my heartfelt wishes
that you will find the world outside a happy valley. To juniors
I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become seniors. To
sophomores I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become
juniors. To freshmen I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will
become sophomores. To those of you going on into graduate
school I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will marry money.

To all of you let me say one thing: during the year I have
been frivolous and funny during the past year—possibly less
often than I have imagined—but the time has now come for
some serious talk. Whatever your status, whatever your plans,
I hope that success will attend your ventures.

Stay happy. Stay loose. © 1963 Max Shulman

We, the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, confess to more than
a few nervous moments during the nine years we have spon-
sored this uninhibited and uncensored column. But in the
main, we have had fun and so, we hope, have you. Let us
add our good wishes to Old Max’s: stay happy; stay loose.

A Poet Relates Features Of Spring

By BILL KINSEY

Where now the Bacchanalia? We
who possess such an amazing amount
of folklore and tradition about the
springtime have let it all slip
through our fingers, to fall forgot-
ten in the dim light of the centuries,
while we content ourselves with
watered-down versions of what
were once spectacles worth behold-
ing. What a poor heritage we have
preserved from the past!

The poet sings of the return of the
daffodils, the buds of May, fluffy
clouds, ete., but the poet is the last
of a breed. He is the only one left
who sings of the coming of spring.
And who should sing of springtime?
Why, the youth of our land, of
course! But where are our youth?
They are confined to cramped and
stifling classrooms in colleges all
across the land—that’s where! Their
natural desires thwarted, they are
forced to listen to this or that pro-
fessor droning on about this or that
minor subject which has absolutely
nothing whatsoever to do with the
season at hand.

Youth is not to be put down com-
pletely however. As surely as the
season returns, so too will other
things. What student’s heart does
not warm when, with the first balmy
day, he sights a kite dancing high
in the spring air? What college man
does not tremble with concealed ex-
citement as he stalks his classmate
with water pistol well-loaded? Is
there a student anywhere who does
not love the solid feel of a well-
built yo-yo tight in his palm? And
everywhere at this time of year,
one finds knots of students on hands
and knees playing at marbles, coats
and ties and books forgotten beside
them.

But these games are mere substi-
tutes. They are the student’s way of
ratifying desires which have been
squelched by the academy in which
he finds himself. Should the student
be content with this? No.

Let the academy be the student’s

By PETE ALFORD

There have been many words
written and spoken recently about
Lamar Lamb’s proposal concerning |
the Honor System. There have been
attacks and counter-attacks, charges
of ruining our cherished traditions,
charges of stiffling the free press and
other general rumblings.

Ventilate Like the British

What each individual must do is
to weigh the merits and weak points
of Lamb’s suggestion and reach a de-
cision. The role of the press should
be to air, or “ventilate” as the
British say, the entire issue and pre-
sent different points of view on the
matter.

We should refrain from charging
individuals with this or that, but
rather should examine the proposal
itself and the merits or demerits
of its construction.

Student Apathy

A recent article in one of the
national magazines described stu-
dent riots at Brown, Princeton, and
Yale. Whenever we read about this
or whenever the freshmen here
make noise in the dining hall there
are always those who question why
we never have a riot. Are we apa-
thetic? Are we content? Do we avoid
causes? We don’t care at all?

Regardless of which answer is cor-
rect, if indeed one is correct, the
students of Washington and Lee are
for several reasons out of touch
with students elsewhere. We are
not aware of what people are think-
ing about at Vanderbilt, Yale, Stan-
