Scholarship

For Service
To Be Given

A perpetual scholarship to
be awarded for distinctive stu-
dent service to the university
will be established by the
Executive Committee, it was

announced today.

The scholarship, provided by the
investment of funds owned by the
student body, will be given annually.
The amount of the award will vary
from $100 to $250 according to the
need of the recipient.

The EC, however, stressed the
fact that the award will not be
made on the basis of need, as are
most university scholarships. The
winner will be chosen entirely on
service to the school, in the fields of
student government, publications, or
any other.

The award will probably be made
at the end of the winner’s junior
year, although the final decision on
this and other details have not
been made as yet. The Executive
Committee will choose each year’s
recipient.

A name for the award has not
been announced, but it is expected
that the name will be chosen and
final plans set up next week.

Student Funds Show Profit

The award stipend will be drawn
from the same fund which provides
operating expenses for the EC each
year. This fund has been invested
over the years by the Rockbridge
National Bank, under the guidance
of Sam Rayder, student body treas-

provides a surplus of around $250
annually.

After conferences with Rayder,

the EC decided to use this money to
establish the award.

EC president Tim Ireland said
the purpose of the award was to
“offer some mode of recognition to
students who have performed dis-
tinetive service to the university.”

 

Dance Board
Sues McPhatter
For Damages

Clyde McPhatter, who failed to
appear for Openings Concert, is be-
ing sued for breach of contract by
agents of the W&L Dance Board.

McPhatter has stated that he was
unable to appear at the concert
because his plane could not land; he
says the breach was unavoidable.
However, suit is being brought
against him for damages of about
$500.

The Dance Board losses stem from
payment for sound equipment which
had been placed in the gym, and
from losses in Dance Plan sales re-
sulting from the incident.

Board President Frank Young said
that nothing in the way of harsh
feelings has passed between repre-
sentatives of the university and the
entertainer. He does not expect the
suit to result in a total victory for his
agents, but hopes for a verdict giving

the Board at least partial considera-!

tion.

NEWS BRIEFS

 

U.Va. Adopts Changes Recommended by Ring-tum Phi

The University of Virginia has instituted the same change in its final
examination schedule which was used as a model for the suggested change
in our own schedule (see editorial, page 2). In light of the fact that some
students were dealt fatal academic blows by cramped exam schedules, the
University of Virginia has initiated three steps to facilitate study before
exams. They are that (1) no roll will be taken during the two days prior
to exams in any class, and (2) no quizzes will be given during regular
class hours of these last two days, and (3) no new work will be assigned.

The object of this is to allow students who have exams during the
first few days of the schedule to prepare properly for their exams. A
discussion of how this might be adopted to the W&L system may be

found in our editorial this week.

EC Plans To Abolish Option;
_ Student Body Opinions Sought

Dangers Of ‘Escape Clause’ Cited;
hae Seen As Non-Existent
By RUSTY RYLAND

The Executive Committee announced today that it favors
doing away with the present option clause in Honor System
procedure as a “measure of further protection to all students.”

President Tim Ireland said that the proposal had the ini-
tial support of the EC, and that Ed Holmes, Bill Boardman,

and Bob Payne had been appoint-*———
ed to make the necessary adjust-
ments in Honor System procedure.

Text of the Statement
The EC statement reads as fol-
Discussion Invited lows:

Ireland also stated that the EC
had a desire for the expression of
opinion from the student body. He
requested that students discuss the
matter and make their opinions
known to the EC.

The

This statement is for the purpose
of acquainting the student body
with a course of action which is now
under the consideration of the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

It has been proposed that the
Executive Committee do away with
the right of an aceused to have an
option of voluntarily withdrawing
from the University rather than fac-
ing trial for an alleged violation of
the honor system.

 

Executive Committee state-
ment listed two main points as
major factors in the decision. First
the EC believes that the option
actually does not benefit the ac-
cused. Although the University
records will read that the student
voluntarily withdrew from the Uni-
versity, University officials are,
nevertheless, obliged to describe the
circumstances if any inquiry is
made by another institution.

An inquiry of this type is almost
always made, and thus the benefits
of the option are negligible.

has received the
initial approval of the Executive
Committee, and this statement is
being presented to the student body
so that the students of W&L will
have the opportunity to discuss the
proposal with members of the Ex-
ecutive Committee before a_ final
vote is taken, and so that the stu-
dents will be informed of the rea-
sons for the action if it is finally ap-
proved.

First, it is the feeling of the Com-
mittee that the option is deceiving
in that it leads a person accused of
an honor system violation to be-
lieve that it will be to his benefit
to take the option.

The proposal

Secondly, the EC is concerned
over the possibility of students ex-

is doubt as to their guilt. “There-

leave school with a clean record,
and partly to the ease with which

An Exam Schedule Suggestion

Perhaps the matter of greatest concern to students and
faculty alike is that of final examinations. Students have to take
them; professors have to grade them. And a great thorn in the
sides of many students is that their exam schedule often puts
them at a great disadvantage.

At Washington and Lee, regular classes are held on the
day immediately preceding the first day of final examinations.
Many students have to worry about last week quizzes and heavy
assignments given by unorganized professors who are trying
to pack two weeks of subject matter into the last three class
periods.

As an example, it is possible for a student to have one
exam on the first day of the exam period, two on the following
day, and one on the day after that. No matter how persevering
a student may be during the semester, such an exam schedule
is too severe a physical and mental strain under which to oper-
ate successfully. High grades which have been sought after
and won all semester long are often lost during the three-hour
final exam simply because the student did not have the hours
in the day necessary for adequate review.

All of this must be considered in the light of the fact that
for many students at Washington and Lee, the process of edu-
cation is only beginning. Graduate school lies ahead, and the
competition for admission to the better schools is fierce. Ad-
mission to these schools is based on grades, recommendations,
and activities, usually in that order. The latter two categories
depend on the first. Recommendations are good or mediocre
depending on the student’s academic showing, and activities
can be pursued or left out depending on the student’s scholastic
success.

So much, therefore, depends on the grade which a student
receives in any class, that the school should make sure that
the student has every opportunity to earn the marks of which
he is capable. The exam schedule we describe in the third
paragraph would severely hamper any student’s preparation
and review for his exams.

The administration has considered the fact that exam
schedules can leave a student at a disadvantage, but it has
been unable to arrive at any solution. The school year cannot
be lengthened in order to allow a few days of grace before
exams begin. Academic calendars are made up years in ad-
vance. We have a solution, therefore, which would require
absolutely no change in the academic schedule. Under this
system, the only thing necessary is the cooperation of the
professors.

Our suggestion is drawn from an idea which the University
of Virginia is initiating this semester. At W&L exams begin
this year on Tuesday, January 22. The day before that is a
full day of classes. Saturday, January 19, is Founders Day,
a holiday. Classes are in session every day of the week before
this. In the second semester, exams begin on Saturday, May
25. Classes are in session right up until that day.

Our proposal sets forth three points. Two class periods
prior to exams, (1) no roll should be taken, (2) no quizzes
should be given during the regular class hour, and (3) no new
work should be assigned. In other words, during the four of
the six days preceding exams, regular classes would be con-
cerned only with review work aimed at clarifying weak points
encountered during the semester. Professors would have to
organize their semester so that they could allow for two days
review at the end. This is something which should be done
anyway, but a few professors assign quizzes and cover extensive
new material in the last three classes before exams.

More than one professor with whom we have talked be-
lieves that this problem is serious, and that the solution we
propose is sound. We shall be very disappointed if the faculty
does not give this proposal serious consideration in its next
meeting, and if the student body does not express itself to
individual professors in order that all professors may be
assured that the exam schedule problem is as serious as we
have stated above. This is a matter of crucial importance, which
should receive immediate and concentrated attention.

The proposal would have one distinct advantage: it would
require no juggling of the University calendar, and could
therefore be initiated with a minimum of difficulty. Further,
the two periods of review, if used properly, would provide the
professor an opportunity to clear up important points which,
without explanation, would require long hours of haphazard
study.

Letters
To The
Editor...

Mr. Timothy Ireland

Dear Tim:

The Faculty Library Committee
wishes to express its sincere appre-
ciation to you and to all members
of your Executive Committee for
your complete cooperation in mak-
ing clear to all the policy to be
followed concerning the wrongful
removal of books from McCormick
Library or any of the departmental
libraries. This is another illustration
of many that I have noted through
the years—of how Washington and
Lee student officers and students
take commendable action when they
fully realize the problem.

Perhaps one would have to attend
school where stacks are closed and
every book used has to be signed
out in order fully to understand the
value of our “open stack” system
and free use of books. To preserve
our library system it must be pro-
tected by all who benefit from it.

For various reasons the idea had
circulated that the wrongful removal
of books from our libraries could
not be treated as an honor system
case, that is, a case to be investi-
gated on possible charges of stealing.
The action of your Executive Com-
mittee will do more than anything
we know to show that the rumor is
wrong. Books are the most valuable
and indispensable things we use in
college, and to remove one contrary
to reasonable regulations is certainly
not honorable.

If you agree that I have correctly
summarized the meaning of the re-
cent action of your committee con-
cerning the wrongful removal of
books, may I have your permission
to send a copy of this letter to the
Ring-tum Phi?

Both editions of the student paper
have been most helpful in empha-
sizing and clarifying your action, and
we wish to express our sincere ap-
preciation to both editors: Landon
Butler and Andrew Nea.

Recent Election Triumphs Of Democrats
Don’t Point Out Popularity Of Kennedy

By JIM BRUTON

Although there was no discernible
pattern in last week’s national elec-
tions, the results showed some sig-
nificant developments. The Repub-
licans gained only two seats in the
House, and lost four in the Senate
(assuming that the Democrats main-
tain the lead in the still unde-
cided races). The Democrats now
have a majority of 259 members in
the House to the Republicans’ 176.
They lead in the Senate 68 to the
Republicans’ 32 members.

In holding intact its large majori-
ties in both houses, the Democratic
Party broke every precedent, since
it should have lost 20 to 40 seats
in off-year voting. This result has
strengthened the prestige of Presi-
dent Kennedy abroad, but does not
indicate domestic support of his pro-
grams.

In 1960, the Democrats lost 21
seats in the House in spite of na-
tional support for their Presidential
candidate. This year the Demo-
cratic Congress opposed President
Kennedy on many aspects of the
New Frontier. In recent elections
the Democrats lost only two seats.
JFK’s programs may have a rough
going-over in Congress next session.

Two Party Break Through

The voting throughout the nation
showed several interesting develop-
ments. The first of these is the
break-through of the two-party sys-
tem, especially in the South, and
the heated competition between the
two parties in all regions. The sec-
ond is the gradual loss of power
for the Republican Party, which
may have to undergo alteration in
the future. The third development
is the outcome of the gubernatorial
elections in key states which may
produce the Republican Presidential
candidate in 64.

Republicans with conservative
programs made dents in the South
by capturing new _ congressional
seats in Florida, Tennessee, and

 

North Carolina. In many _ other
closely contested districts voters
chose conservative Democrats, how-
ever, over conservative Republicans
largely because of party label. In
Alabama the liberal Senator Lister
Hill just narrowly defeated a Re-
publican. In Texas hopeful Repub-
liceans gained one rather than the
expected three additional seats.

Democrats in New England

The Democrats invaded areas of
New England where they had never
been heard of before. Republican
Governor John Reed closely squeez-
ed by his Democratic challenger in
Maine. Democratic Endicott Pea-
body won the Massachusetts gover-
norship, and Vermont elected a
Democratic governor for the first
time in 100 years.

In the Midwest, Republicans lost
veteran Indiana Senator Capehart,
who had demanded action on Cuba.
Republican Senator Alexander Wiley
was defeated in Wisconsin as was
Republican Representative Walter
Judd in Minnesota. Republican
James Rhodes defeated Mike DiSalle
in the Ohio gubernatorial race.

In the West, conservative Repub-
lican Dominick ousted liberal Demo-
crat John Carroll in Colorado. In
California, conservative Republicans
Rousselot and Hiestand, victims of
a fantastic redistricting scheme, were
defeated. As we all know, Richard
Nixon lost because of the dissatisfied
right wing in his own party and the
dissatisfied electorate in his own
state.

Conservatism in the South

The Republican success in Ken-
tucky and in areas further south
suggests that an all-out conserva-
tive drive would yield further
gains, at least in the South and
Southwest. In the _ industrialized
northern states, moderate to liberal
Republican candidates such as Rom-
ney, Scranton, and Rockefeller won
because they seemed liberal enough
to capture Democratic votes.

 

The elections showed the dilem-
ma that the Republicans face. They
must campaign on Conservative pro-
grams to win in the South and
Southwest. They must become more
liberal to win in the North. They
have to woo the liberal or con-
servative voters in both parts of
the country since the Democrats
outnumber the Republicans in regis-
tration.

The Republican Party will, there-
fore, have to decide whether to be-
come wholly liberal or wholly con-
servative, or else it will suffer a
split in ranks. One may ask why this
prediction is plausible if the Demo-
cratic Party, which also contains
conservative and liberal wings, has
managed to hold together. The an-
swer is that the Democratic organi-
zation has become so well entrench-
ed in this country since the New
Deal that it has maintained control
despite differences within.

The Democratic Image

Also, the Democrats have a tradi-
tional image of being able to pro-
duce more effective leaders, whether
liberal or conservative, than the
Republicans. The difference between
the two parties then is that the
Democratic is controlled more by
its liberal members and the Repub-
licans more by its conservatives. If
the Republican organization hopes
to strengthen itself, it must get off
the fence and turn either to the right
or to the left and then it must pro-
vide dynamic leadership in which-
ever course it takes.

That brings us to consider the
next G.O.P. presidendital candidate.
In the course of the next two years
barring a catstrophic upset such as
a depression, in which the people
would turn to new ideas (Goldwater
conservatism, for example)—barring
such an event, the G.O.P. is certain
to nominate a liberal in ’64. Since
the moderate type of Republican
(Nixon) is no longer around, and

a Ph.D. and seven hold law de-
grees.

All of them are well-known in
their fields of endeavor, and nearly
all of them are exceptionally
wealthy.

The facts are impressive, but the
men themselves are even more so.

Former West Virginia Governor

Homer Adams Holt, who got his
B.A. here in 1918, went on to earn
his LL.B. and LL.D. degrees soon
afterwards.

While here, he was a Phi Kappa
Psi and a Phi Beta Kappa. When
he graduated, he became instructor
in mathematics in the undergradu-
ate school for three years.

He was assistant professor of law
1923-24, and associate law profes-
sor the following year.

From 1933-37 Holt served as at-
torney general of West Virginia,
moving from there to the state’s
executive mansion when he was
elected governor in 1937.

Aside from his active political
life, Holt has been a busy business-
man.

He was General Counsel of Union
Carbide and Carbon Corp. from
1947-1953, was vice president 1949-
53, and director 1944-55.

Holt is now a practicing attorney
in Charleston, W. Va.

Steamship Mogul

Joseph Taliaferro Lykes received
his B.A. degree in 1909, and was a
Phi Delta Theta while at W&L.

Listed in Who’s Who, Lykes is
chairman of the Board, Lykes Broth-
ers Steamship Company in Tampa,
Florida—one of the largest steam-
ship companies in the world, and is
director of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Atlanta.

was an SAE at W&L and an active
participant in student life while
here.

He is presently chairman of the

An interesting side note is that
St. Clair’s father was on the board
of trustees of the University before
him.

Master of “The Meadow”

Christopher Tompkins Chenery
graduated in 1909 with a BS. in
Engineering. He was a Phi Delt
and Phi Beta Kappa.

Chenery is chairman of the Board
of Southern Natural Gas Corpora-

master and owner of “The Meadow,”
a famous and successful horse rac-

Landing and Sir Gaylord, two of
horse racing’s biggest winners.

Kennon Caithness Whittle got his
LL.B. from W&L in 1914 and his

U.S. Court of Appeals out of New
Orleans, La.—and it was in his court
that the Meredith-Ole Miss proceed-
ings took place.
Mrs. duPont

Mrs. Jessie Ball duPont, while
not a graduate of W&L certainly

 

stands as one of the most outstand-
of the school’s trustees.

Wife of the late industrialist, Mrs.
duPont has made a place for her-
self in her own right in the busi-
ness world. She is chairman of
the board of St. Joe Paper Co.,
and has succeeded in multiplying
the estate of her late husband.

Long a friend to education and
a generous supporter of Washington
and Lee, Mrs. duPont has done much
towards improving higher education
today.

Multi-Millionaire

John Franklin Hendon graduated
with a BS. in Commerce in 1924,
and was a Pi Kappa Phi at W&L.

Today, he is the proprietor of a
large chain of garages and service
stations—a chain so large, in fact,
that it adds up to a value of several
million dollars.

Bank of Georgia Head

Joseph Earle Birnie graduated in
1927 and was a Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon.

He is listed in Who’s Who, and
serves as President and Director
of the Bank of Georgia, which is
the largest bank in the South.

Leading Attorney

Lewis Franklin Powell, Jr., got
his B.S. in Commerce from W&L in
1929, his LL.B. in 1931 and _ his
LL.D. in 1960.

While he was at W&L, Powell
was a member of Phi Kappa Sig-
ma, Phi Beta Kappa, Beta Gamma
Sigma and Omicron Delta Kappa.

He is a partner today in Hunton,
Williams, Gay, Powell and Gibson,
which is one of the leading law
firms in the state.

A distinguished leader of the
American Bar, Powell has served on
numerous ABA committees and has
worked for the publie school system
as a member of Richmond's school
board.

Men of Achievement

These, then, are the policy-making
men who comprise the Board of
Trustees of the University.

Many of their accomplishments
have necessarily been ommitted, for
lack of space.

But the point has been made.

They are men of great achieve-
ment, and they epitomize what is
meant by the Washington and Lee
way.

Keesee Tally
In 3rd Period

Nips Sewanee

Washington and Lee played at its |
muddy best Saturday, tripping Se-
wanee, 8-0, and clinching a tie for

the College Athletic Conference
title.
The Generals need only to whip

Southwestern at Memphis, Tenn.,
next Saturday in their last game to
wrap up the first football title in
the new four-team conference. The
Generals are 2-0 in conference play
and 7-1 overall.

Sewanee battled the Generals
evenly for nearly three quarters and
then handed W&L a gift-wrapped
scoring opportunity.

Bad Punt the Key

Bogged down at its own 22,
Sewanee sent Wallace Pinkley into
punt formation. The kick went off .
the side of Pinkley’s foot and rolled
out of bounds at the Tiger 38.

This was all the help the Gen-
erals needed as they promptly rolled
up their only score in nine plays.

A pair of key third down plays
kept the W&L drive in motion.

With third and seven at the 35
quarterback Chuck Lane found
halfback Stu Yoffe with a 14-yard |
pass. Then with third and three at)
the 13, halfback Skip Chase burst

up the middle to the four. :
Senior tackle Bob Payne was

Keesee Scores | awarded the Ty Rauber Memorial

Yoffe picked up two yards and) Award Saturday by President Fred
then fullback Tommy  Keesee
plunged over from one yard out, two
plays later.

Halfback Henry Sackett, trapped |
behind the line of scrimmage, trap- |
ped again at the two, and confronted |
by Sewanee star M. L. Agnew at)
the one, slipped and slid his way
for the two-point conversion with |
0:37 left in the third period.

If anything can be singled out ”
the main cause of the Washington |
and Lee victory, it would have to be |
a vastly improved pass defense.

Coming into the contest, Agnew, |C. Cole during the halftime of the
the Sewanee tailback, was the CAC 's| Washington and Lee-Sewanee game.
leading passer with 25 completions | Payne received the award for

unwillingly boasted the league’s|
worst pass defense, allowing 84.9 |
yards per game.

W&L Harriers Roll To Second In State Meet
Generals Rap Sewanee, Clinch Tie For CAC Title

   

Everybody Shines
In Win Over Tigers

By JOHN ALLGOOD

Trying to hand out plaudits for Washington and Lee’s 8-0 victory
over Sewanee Saturday is like trying to guess how much money is in
the window of the Rockbridge National Bank—almost impossible.
deserve mention.

Quarterback Chuck Lane played one of his best all-round games
this season, completing three of four passes for 62 yards, gaining 19
yards rushing, intercepting one pass, breaking up several others, and
generally playing terrific defense.

Tackles Bob Payne and Phil McCaleb both turned in praisworthy
defensive games. Payne put considerable pressure on Sewanee’s M. L.
Agnew and McCaleb threw the Tiger for a costly 10-yard loss.

Fullback Tommy Keesee, although gaining 27 yards,
game’s only touchdown and starred early on defense.

Ends John Madison and Buck Ogilvie consistently rushed past the
Sewanee line, giving Agnew fits when he tried to pass. Madison also
make a key interception of an Agnew pass.

Halfback Skip Chase was the Generals’
67 yards.

Punter Doug Davis deserves unusually high praise because he, for all
practical purposes, saved W&L from an 8-8 tie. With W&L stopped
at its 40, Davis went back to punt, but the ball was centered under his
feet. He recovered, however, and got off a low, line-drive 22-yard
kick with four Sewanee players literally on top of him.

Halfbacks Stu Yoffe and Henry Sackett, linebackers Mike Sheffey
and Steve Davenport, and guards Bill Angel and George Gossman also
rated stars for their performance.

Several of the Generals, however,

scored the

big ground gainer with

 

eo et

 

1961.
The last back to receive the honor
was fullback Doug Martin in 1960.
Against Johns Hopkins, Payne
was instrumental in stopping the
Blue ~~. lauded pening attack.

ROBERT E. LEE

Miller said.

“When we put seven within 56
seconds against Roanoke two weeks
ago, we began building up. We
reached our peak Monday.”

tion it would be as a measure of
further protection to all students
rather than an abridgement of any
rights which now exist. We feel that
under the present situation possible
injustice may occur and _ therefere
desire to take action to prevent it.

In the novice division of a twelve-
school debate held at the University
of South Carolina this past week-
end, W&L tied for third place, com-
piling a record of seven wins and
5 defeats.

Executive Committee may change

However, before we reach a final

desire. —
