The Journeymen, Odetta Featured Tonight
In First Of Two Springs Concerts For 1963

Springs Weekend, set to a
“Holiday in Havana’ theme,
gets underway this evening
with the appearance of Odetta

and Journeymen in the gym at
8 o'clock.

This year’s show features two ex-
tra attractions: it furnishes a blow-
out after a week of tense cam-
paigning for campus political offices,
and it coincides with a VMI week-
end which should supply dates un-
limited to the Minks.

Ed Croft, President of Springs, and
his vice presidents, will be intro-
duced in the figure at the concert
tonight. Vice presidents are John
Madison, Mike Jenkins, Pete Can-
dler, Lanier Woodrum, Bip Fauber,
John Gulick, and Tom Rains.

The Friday concert will be fol-
lowed Saturday night by a concert
featuring the Isley Brothers and Bo
Diddley, in accordance with the
trend toward more concerts and few-
er dances on big weekends.

Holiday in Havana”

The gym will be decorated with
palm trees and tropical scenes going
along with the theme of “Holiday in
Havana.” Mike Jenkins, vice pres-
ident in charge of decorations, says
that he has tried to catch the
beauty and splendor of the island of
Cuba in the decorations.

Tonight’s performers are some of
the biggest names in folk music to-
day. Odetta is hailed as one of the
truly great contemporary artists, not
only in the field of folk music, but
in blues as well. She has played
night clubs from “The Hungry i” to

the “Blue Angel.” Odetta records
for RCA and has cut several al-
bums.

The Publications Board has an-
nounced the selection of Roger
Paine, Phi Gam, and Ken Lane, Phi
Delt, as editors of next year’s Tues-
day and Friday editions of the
Ring-tum Phi respectively.

Walt McManus, Phi Psi, was named
business manager for both editions.

Tain Tompkins, Phi Gam, and
Diek MeEnally, Lambda Chi, were
selected as editor and business man-

ager respectively of the 1963-64
Southern Collegian.
Appearing Wednesday before the

Publications Board, which consists
of the present and past editors and
business manager of the Ring-tum
Phi, Southern Collegian, and Calyx,
these candidates were selected on
a basis of their qualifications, grades,
and experience. These newly ap-
pointed heads-of-staff will take
charge of their posts next fall.
Paine, a rising senior from Arling-
ton, Va., is president of the Publi-
cations Board and former editor of
the Southern Collegian, and current-
ly managing editor of the Tuesday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi and has
been on the Ring-tum Phi staff for

 

 

pop ballads, blues and modern jazz

as at folk singing. Their single re-|

cording of “Kumbahya” has been
their biggest hit to date. The group
consists of John Phillips, Richard
Weismann, and Scott McKenzie. The
trio was discovered by Frank Weber,
manager of the original Kingston
Trio.

Bo Diddley and the Isley Brothers,
slated for tomorrow night's concert,
have appeared at Washington and
Lee in the past. Bo Diddley has been
one of the biggest names in rock
and roll since 1955, when he rose
to fame with the hit recording of
“Bo Diddley.”

Many of Bo Diddley’s numerous

WGL Hit
By Death
Of Student

William D. Suggs, III, 21, a Wash-
ington and Lee University junior
from Richmond, Va., died Tuesday
in his room here of an apparently
self-inflicted wound.

Dr. E. V. Brush, Rockbridge
County Medical Examiner, said the
wound was “apparently self-inflict-
ed” by a double-barreled shotgun.
Dr. Brush set the time of Suggs’
death at approximately 2:30 p.m.

Suggs, the son of Dr. and Mrs.
William D. Suggs, was found by
two fellow students around 5 p.m.
Tuesday in his room in a small cot-
tage on the Kappa Alpha fraternity
grounds. Suggs was a member of
Kappa Alpha.

University officials said that Suggs
had given no indication of unusual
problems. University records showed
his grades were satisfactory.

In addition to his parents, Suggs
is survived by a sister.

A funeral service was held Thurs-
day at noon at St. Stephen’s Episco-
pal Church in Richmond.

The Die Is Cast

Congratulations to the newly elected officers. Your victory
came about only because you earned it, not because of party
allegiance or lack of competition.

In toasting you, the leaders of next year’s student body,
we feel perhaps we are toasting the advent of a new epoch
at W&L. A new party was developed this year—a party under
the name Progressive. In past years, a party bearing such a
name would have been doomed. Moreover, in past years a
party bearing such a slate of candidates would have very likely

been doomed.

Why? Because your attitude and approach in campaigning
struck its appeal at a certain sentiment—a sentiment which has
become prominent at W&L only in recent years. That W&L
is undergoing a change is no longer a mere conversation piece.
It has decidedly become a reality during these elections!

The victory of the Progressive party, gentlemen, symbolizes
a transition. The “party of the University” has been defeated
by a totally new faction—a Progressive faction. The banner-
head this party has assumed would have been repulsed by the
student body of several years ago.

The candidates who won represent a striking contrast to
their opponents. This observation is particularly brought out
in the rivalry for student body president. Whether Bill Noell
should have won is no longer the question. The point to con-
sider is why. The answer, an answer which would have upset
previous student bodies, is that Noell relied on intellect as his
key vote-winning asset. He did not win a contest of popularity;
he won a contest of intelligence.

You, the defeated candidates of the University party—
are victims—victims of a serious change at W&L. All the beer
rallies in the world could not have saved you. Unfortunately or

not, you played for a definite appeal and lost.

—K. P. L.

 

Freshman Observes
Changes At W&L

By JIM BRUTON

Let's face it. W&L is no longer
“the party school of the party schools
of the South.” “Four years ago,”
a senior recently told me, “I could
stand in front of the Lyric Theater
on the Saturday night of a dance
weekend and hear wild screams all
the way from Red Square.”

“I could enter a fraternity house
the next day and see that a real
party had taken place. Now the old
social spirit of W&L has almost
disintegrated.”

New Type Freshman

Many students are aware of a
change on this campus—a change in
the attitude of each incoming class.
Against heavy competition the ad-
missions office at W&L, as well as
at other colleges, is forced to turn
its attention to the smarter, more
serious-minded student. Conse-
quently, each year’s crop of fresh-
men, including this one, appears less
inclined to maintain the old fra-
ternity and party spirit. Maybe this
is what another senior meant, when
he snapped at me, “You freshmen
are a bunch of finks.”

But if social vigah has decreased
as smart students increase, there
must be, at least, a lot of non-social
intellectual activity. There isn’t,
though, take for example, politics.
The student body is considered
overwhelmingly conservative, but
only 35 out of 1100 students are
members of the Conservative So-
ciety, and 10 out of that 35 put
out the Southern Conservative.

Lack of Participation

Look at the Ring-tum Phi. Most
of the work for it is done by just
a handfull. Look at the poor atten-
dance at some of the visiting lec-
tures (“Darn, there’s nothing to do
in Lexington.”), some of whom are
very noted men who have given bril-
liant talks. Consider the weak school
spirit and support we give at foot-
ball games.

The point I’m making is that, on
the whole, W&L students have be-
come dull and uninterested. A Ring-
tum Phi editorial of a few weeks
ago mockingly complained of the
lack of enthusiasm over anything:
“But alas, the panty raid, and all
that glorious tradition has seen its
day. A whole new generation of
college students has arisen since
that day—beetle-browed, _ serious,
grasping young intellectuals...The
student body is...smarter—duller.”

What happened to riots, picketing,
panty raids on Sem, effigy burning
of professors, or demonstrations for
Martin Luther King? What happen-
ed te the vibrant playboy of the
“golden days” that seniors talk
about? Where is the respected radi-
cal intellectual who does more than
just sit down and talk about “God,
sex, and world problems?”

 

Although fraternities are strug-
gling against formidable circum-
stances to stir up the old “hell-rais-
ing party spirit, they merely reflect,
on the other hand, the apathetic,
lackidaisical atmosphere pervading
W&L. Look in any house on campus
and you will find a number of “fra-
ternity vegetables.” These unique in-
dividuals, after entering a fraternity,
tend to isolate themselves in the
fraternity haven, seldom participat-
ing in any university functions. For
them the “tube,” the card-table, or
an occasional date on weekends is
enough exertion. Today, I might add,
fraternities must try to arouse and
stimulate its members to integrate
into rather than isolate themselves
from university life. Fraternities
must do this in order to justify
their existence.

The problem of inertness, intellec-
tual as well as social, is not con-
fined just to this campus. In col-
leges everywhere professors com-
plain of unfeeling, unexcitable, con-
forming students. But the fact that
the rest of the country is as bad as
we are is no reason for satisfaction.

Why can’t there be more contro-
versy (a left-wing club to needle
the conservatives); or some. vital
campus issues brought to light (1
mean specifically, by opposing can-
didates in the next student elec-
tions)? Why can’t we have an at-
mosphere which would give rise to
stimulating and enlightening pro-
grams (like the “Focus” held at
Randolph-Macon) ?

Of course we can’t turn back the
clock to the old days of the really
wild fraternity affairs such as co-
educational showers or bikini-jock-
strap parties. But one thing is cer-
tain. Until we at W&L become more
sensitive yet more excitable, more
aware yet more active in intellec-
tual, cultural, and academic pur-
suits—until we do this, then our
esteemed social life, which has given
W&L a name and us students pride,
will remain anemic.

Letter To The Editor

Dear Janitors,

Despite the high temperatures,
tempers, and humidity which have
struck this campus in the past week,
the heaters in the north wing of the
New Freshman Dorm have been left
going full blast, to the great dis-
comfort and chagrin of the occu-
pants thereof. Unfortunately, no
matter how much one tinkers with
the little knobs on the heaters, the
things still produce a considerable
amount of hear. Please, then, turn
these heaters off be fore we rise in
mass and do the job ourselves, an
operation which is not likely to be
very neat or condusive to the proper
functioning of the heaters next win-
ter.

Playboy Attacks U.S. Puritanism,
Blames Religion

By HUGH M. HEFNER
Editor of Playboy

(The following is a reprint of part
of a series recently appearing in
a popular magazine for erudite
young men.)

We have tried to show in previous
issues how an improper emphasis
on security and conformity stifled
this country for a generation and we
have pointed to signs that suggest,
to us, that initiative and the indivi-
dual may soon again be receiving
their proper due. But there has
been another stifling influence in
America—far more insidious—that
has pervaded our culture since the
nation’s beginnings, yet most of us
are only vaguely aware of its con-
tinuing effect on every facet of our
laws and lives.

Puritanism—as stultifying to the
mind of man as communism, or
any other totalitarian concept—has
been a part of the American cul-
ture since the country’s earliest
settlers landed on Plymouth Rock,
or thereabouts. For it matters little
if a book is burned because it con-
tains an unpopular political idea
or an unpopular moral or religious
one—the book has been burned
just the same—and society is alit-
tle poorer for having lost perhaps
just one small voice, one differ-
ence of opinion, one divergent
thought or idea.

We must never forget that this
democracy draws its matchless
strength from the continuous free
exchange of differing ideas and by
keeping open the channels of com-
munication for even the most un-
popular points of view. Our found-
ing fathers made the protection of
every minority and every minority
opinion of paramount importance in
both our Constitution and the Bill of
Rights. They recognized that down
through history great men and great
ideas have been unpopular in their
own time. Man learns slowly and
cultural changes that might other-
wise take years require generations
while those that might take genera-
tions sometimes take centuries. Soc-
rates, teacher of Plato, and recog-
nized today as one of the great phil-
osophers of history, was accused in
his own time of being without fixed
principles and sentenced to die by
drinking poison hemlock; Van Gogh,
the brilliant and prolific impression-
ist, sold only four paintings during
his lifetime, was driven mad by des-
pair and killed himself; Galileo was
twice tried by the Inquisition for
daring to suggest that the earth re-
volves around the sun; Christ was
nailed to a cross for teaching that
man should love his fellow man.

Progress necessarily requires the
exchange of outdated ideas for new
and better ones. By keeping open
all lines of communication in our
culture, every new idea—no mat-
ter how seemingly preverse, im-
proper or peculiar, has its opportu-
nity to be considered, to be chal-
lenged, and ultimately to be ac-
cepted or rejected by society as a
whole or by some small part of
it. This is the important advan-
tage that a free society has over
a totalitarian one, for in the free
exchange of ideas, the best will
ultimately win out. A dictatorship,
with its pre-established dogma, is
chained to the past; a free society
may draw from past, present and
the future.

Too often the most readily
acknowledged precepts become cli-
ches to which mere lip service is
paid while their real intent and sig-
nificance are lost.

In America we have built an en-
tire nation—a social order, economy
and government—on this concept of
freedom. And whatever shortcom-
ings it may seem to have are, we
believe, less inherent in the ideal
of a free society than they are the
result of our failing to keep faith
with that ideal. This not to suggest
that a nation as large and as com-
plex as this one is capable of re-
maining free for all without some
supervision and control. The eco-
nomie system of free enterprise, for
example, would not continue to
function successfully without cer-
tain necessary checks and balances. |
But it is important for us never to|

 

lose sight of the primary aim and
purpose of our government, which
should be to achieve and perpetuate
the maximum amount of freedom
and opportunity possible for all of its
citizens.

The freedom also includes free-
dom from ignorance, sickness,
poverty and fear without which
the other freedoms would be
meaningless. Our government is
sometimes likened to a parent, but
it must be careful not to become
a too overly protective parent,
whose guidance and _ control
smother initiative and self respect.

The individual remains the all im-
portant element in our society—the
touchstone against which all else
must be judged. The individual’s
very individuality—his right to look,
think and act as differently from his
fellows as he chooses (without of
course, interfering with the similar
rights of others)—supplies the di-
vergent, interacting components that
produce progress.

No group is necessarily more im-
portant than each individual member
of the group. Group thought is not
necessarily superior to individual
thought and neither is group taste.
It is our feeling, moreover, that ac-
tions taken to allegedly benefit one
group or another—the taxpayer, the
working man, the consumer, society,
the nation—too often benefit almost
no one. So-called “group good” is
is some times a vagary that shields
an activity that could not be justi-
fied on any individual basis.

All totalitarian concepts place
a particular group—a race, a re-
ligion, a class, a country—ahead of
the individual. Thus the political
extremes of right and left—social-
ism and communism on the one
hand and fascism and Nazism on
the other—have more in common,
each with the other, then they do
with democracy, whose system of
checks and balances places it at
the political center. Einstein’s
theory of curved space would seem
to apply to the political universe
as well as the physical one: the
opposite extremes of political dog-
ma eventually meet.

It is not enough to recognize that
a nation is no more important than
the sum of all of its people: a country
is no more important than each of
its citizens, taken singly, and apart

 

For Lost Rights

from all the rest. For only through
concern and respect for each mem-
ber of society can the whole of so-
ciety hope to achieve its ultimate
potential.
American Puritanism

Our founding fathers established
protections for America’s individual
citizens in both the Constitution of
the United States and the Bill of
Rights, assuring that this nation’s
rule by the majority would always
be tempered with a concern for the
rights and privileges of the most
insignificant of our minorities.

American jurisprudence is es-
pecially concerned with the protec-
tion of the individual, differing from
much of Europe’s law in that a man
must always be considered innocent
until proven guilty; and further, that
we would rather allow four guilty
men to go free than unjustly con-
vict one who is innocent.

With such an acute awareness
of the importance of protecting the
rights and freedom of every indi-
vidual in our society, it is inter-
esting to see how and why many of
these rights have been lost. Please
do not consider us impious if we
suggest that it is American religion
that is largely to blame.

Since many of the early settlers
left Europe for the New World spe-
cifically because of religious perse-
cution, it seems especially strange
that they should adopt the very
practices from which they had so
recently fled. Nevertheless, that is
precisely what they did.

Organized religion, as separated
from any personal faith, has had a
considerable civilizing influence upon
mankind through all of history; it
has fostered hope, charity and edu-
cation. But bloody wars have also
been fought because of it, and mil-
lions kept in abject poverty, tortured
and executed in the vilest ways.

Presumably, a man’s religion
should make him a beter person—
more tolerant, sympathetic and
understanding towards his fellows.
Too often organized religion has
had the opposite effect, placing its
emphasis on orthodoxy instead of
understanding and emphasizing
ritual and dogma rather than the
spiritual founding principles of
faith and love. And make no mis-
take—the tyranny of man over his
fellow man is just as great an evil

when it is wielded in the name of
God as in the name of the state.

The early Puritans who settled
in America did not see their religion
as simply one aspect of life, but the
whole of it. As Puritan leader Jona-
than Edwards wrote in describing
the Christian’s “practice of religion”;
“It may be said, not only to be his
business at certain seasons, the busi-
ness of Sabbathdays, or certain ex-
traordinary times, or the business of
a month, or a year, or seven years,
or his business under certain cir-
cumstances; but the business of his
life.” This attitude is shared by a
great many religious people, of var-
ious faiths, today. And as far as it
goes, it can hardly be criticized.
But it must be recognized that in
defining the “practice of religion”
as a full-time, 24-hour-a-day prop-
osition, religion pervades, directs
and controls the totality of human
life and thought. Religion may thus
be used to justify the regulation of
all man’s activity—and, indeed, it
has been.

The early Puritan in America is
described by the Encyclopaedia
Britannica as “a_ spiritual athlete,
characterized by an intense zeal to
reform, a zeal to order everything—
personal life, family life, worship,
church, business affairs, political af-
fairs, even recreation—in the light of
God’s demand upon him.” This re-
ligion required conformity and things
went badly for those early Ameri-
cans who proved unwilling to con-
form.

If authenticated cases of “witch
burning” were relatively unknown
in early America (compared to the
thousands of religious executions
in Europe by fire, drawing and
quartering, boiling in oil, disem-
bowlment and a great variety of
other tortures too numerous to
catalog here, throughout the 16th,
17th and 18th Centuries) our Pur-
itan forefathers had other subtler
ways of keeping the citizens in
line—public floggings, the stocks,
the scarlet letter, the ducking
stool and an occasional hanging—
all for relatively minor infringe-
ments of the religious dicta of the
time.

The Britannica further describes
the daily routine of the Puritan as
having involved “the keeping of a
spiritual diary in which the events
of the day were closely serutinized
and an accounting made of moral
successes and failures as well as note
being taken of the signal evidences
of divine grace or displeasure that
had been disclosed during the course
of the day.” And if all thls strikes
the reader as being more like Or-
well’s 1984 than the beginnings of
democracy in America, we can only
add a solemn amen.

Generals held the lead until the
seventh and eighth innings when
the Hoyas’ pulled the game out of
the fire.

The Generals’ main trouble
leaving men on base. Washington and
Lee had seven chances to score
and only capitalized on two of them.
The Generals’ biggest threats came
in the seventh and ninth innings. In
the seventh with bases loaded and
one out Eric Sisler, the lead off man,
popped out to second and Ashley
Allen popped out to third base.
The ninth was a repeat of the sev-
enth: with bases loaded and one
gone both Sisler and Allen popped
out.

The Generals’s runs came in the
sixth and seventh innings. Sisler
reached first on an error charged to
the shortstop. Allen sacrificed mov-
ing Sisler to second. With Sisler on
second, captain Chuck Lane slammed
a long triple to left field. All this
took place with two away. The in-
ning ended as Lane was caught try-
ing to steal home. The Generals’
second run came in the seventh
when Taylor singled, followed by

ended in the seventh by an untimely
single. Nevertheless, Gamber held
the Hoyas to only four hits.

Four Hits

The Generals had four hits, all
by different men. Sisler singled,
Lane trippled, and both Taylor and
Gamber singled. The overall ap-
pearance of the team semed to have
been improved greatly from their
game with the University of Connec-
tieut.

Georgetown scored three runs on
four hits and four Washington and
Lee errors. W&L got two runs on
the same amount of hits and seven
Georgetown errors. Captain Lane
is now 12 for 25 and leads the
team with a .480 average.

An interesting point came in the
sixth inning when, as Lane broke
for the plate from third, the pitcher,
still not having placed his foot on
the rubber, became Georgetown’s
“seventh infielder” and threw Lane
out at the plate.

The Generals face a tough RPI
team next Thursday. The team has
compiled a 1 and 6 record for the
year so far.

proving and, if its 101-39 slaughter
of Hampden-Sydney is any example
of strength, the meet could be ex-
tremely close. The last time these
two teams met was in 1955 when
W&L came out on the short end of
the score 7714-534.

In last wek’s Hampden-Sydney
meet most of the team had _ their
best performances of the year and
are looking for ward to improving
on them after intense workouts
this week. Freshman Don Casto
looked fine in the sprints and Andy
Kilpatrick shows signs of return-
ing to his old form. With strong
performance from each member of
the squad, W&L may reverse the
1955 score and chalk up their sec-
ond victory of the season.

John Baker in action against Hoyas. His fast-moving game

game lead W&L to victory.

Tennis Team Soundly Trounces
Georgetown: John Baker Shines

The W&L tennis team scored its
first victory of the season by soundly
defeating Georgetown University 6-
3 Tuesday. The match was much
closer than the score indicates and
the Generals were doubtful of their
victory right up to the final doubles
match.

The two teams split the singles
matches 3-3. DeYoung come from
behind to beat Wolf of Georgetown
2-6, 6-2, 6-4. Captain John Baker de-
feated his opponent 6-2, 2-6, 6-3.
and Jones easily handled Fay of
Georgetown 6-3, 6-1. Having swept
the first three singles matches, the
Generals faltered and lost the next
three. John Mell lost to Bowes 3-6,
6-4, 6-3; Lindsey Short lost a tough
one 6-3, 7-5; and Howard Busse lost
to the Hoyas’ Gargaro 1-6, 6-4, 6-2.

With the match tied up the net-
men had to take two of the three
doubles matches. In the first match
DeYoung and Jones teamed up to

defeat Wolf and Hodgman of George-
town 6-4, 6-2. Following this match
John Baker and Lindsey Short took
on Fay and Bowes and barely won
6-4, 1-6, 8-6. In the last match
Mell and Mill defeated Dolan and
DeCarr 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.

The Generals’ record now stands
at 1-1, having previous lost to
Hampden-Sydney. The team travels
to Lynchburg to meet their team
on April 22. Lynchburg is tough in
the singles department with Berry
being their best man. Nevertheless,
they shouldn’t present too much of
a problem to the W&L netmen. Pos-
sibly the toughest match of the sea-
son will be against George Wash-
ington on April 29.

Sophomore Chris Wigert walked
only one, struck-out six in six in-
nings, and the Generals pounded out
nineteen hits as the team coasted to
a 10-7 victory over RPI at Richmond
yesterday.

Wigert’s fast ball and cure were
especially effective as the RPI Bat-
ters could muster only six singles
off him before he tired in the sev-
enth. He also helped his own cause
by hitting two singles to add to
his single and home run of last week.
This makes Wigert’s second victory
for the season and the second time
he was influencial in a W&L vic-
tory.

The Generals again started fast as
they jumped to a three-run lead in
the first inning. Sisler opened the
inning with a single and then Chuck
Lane made the score 2-0 as he
boomed a towering fly ball which
went for a home run. Three straight
singles by Flannigan, Taylor and
Martin added the other run and the
Generals never lost the lead.

 

 

In the fifth W&L added three more
runs to make the score 8-1 by the
end of the inning. Flannigan hit a
single, and after a ground out to
short, Martin, Rose, and Davis fol-
lowed with three hits spaced around
a double steal which added three
more runs to the General’s lead.

It wasn’t until the seventh that
RPI could muster a rally, which, for
all purposes, was too late, It was
evident that the Generals felt they
had the game sown up because they
made four errors in the seventh and
eighth which allowed four runs to
cross the plate.

The Generals completely over-
powered RPI as they outhit them
19-13. Sisler, Flannigan, and Lane
each had three hits for W&L while
Martin and Taylor collected two
apiece. What was even more pleas-
ing was the fact that the Generals
had nine RBI's. Shultz looked good
for RPI with a home run and 2
singles.

FILLING A WELL-NEEDED GAP

Although my son is a college freshman, I am glad to say that
he is still not too old to climb up on my lap and have a heart-
to-heart talk when things are troubling him. My boy is enrolled
at Harvard where he is studying to be a fireman. From the
time he was a little tiny baby he always said he wanted to be
a fireman. Of course, my wife and I believed that he would
eventually grow out of it, but no sir, the little chap never
wavered in his ambition for one minute!

So here he is at Harvard today taking courses in net holding,
mouth-to-mouth breathing, carbon tetrachloride, and Dalma-
tian dogs. It is a full schedule for the young man, and that, in
fact, is exactly what we talked about when last he climbed
upon my lap.

He complained that every bit of his time is taken up with his
major requirements. He doesn’t have so much as one hour a
week to sample any of the fascinating courses outside his major
—history, literature, language, science, or any of the thousand
and one things that appeal to his keen young mind.

I am sure that many of you find yourselves in the same
scholastic bind; you are taking so many requirements that you
can’t find time for some appealing electives. Therefore, in to-
day’s column I will forego levity and give you a brief survey in
a subject that is probably not included in your curriculum.

oy
a

on

I have asked the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes whether I
might employ this column—normally a vehicle for innocent
merriment—to pursue this serious end. ‘“‘Of course you may,
crazy kid,” they replied kindlily, their grey eyes crinkling at
the corners, their manly mouths twisted in funny little grins.
If you are a Marlboro smoker—and what intelligent human
person is not?—you would expect the makers of Marlboro to
be fine men. And so they are—wonderful guys, every man-jack
of them—good, generous, understanding, wise. They are each
tipped with a pure white filter and come in soft pack or Flip-
Top box.

But I digress. We were going to take up a topic you are
probably unable to cover in your busy academic life. Let us
start with the most basic topic of all—anthropology, the study
of man himself.

Man is usually defined as a tool-making animal, but I per-
sonally do not find this definition entirely satisfactory. Man is
not the only species which makes tools. The simians, for ex-
ample, make monkey wrenches.

Still, when you come to a really complicated tool—like a
linotype, for instance—you can be fairly sure it was made by
Homo sapiens —or else a very intelligent tiger. The question one
should ask, therefore, is not who made the tool, but what did
he do with it.

For example, in a recent excavation in the Olduvai Gorge a
large assortment of hominoid fossils was found, all dating back
to the Middle Pleistocene Age. Buried with the fossils was a
number of their artifacts, the most interesting being a black
metal box which emitted a steady beeping sound. Now, of
course, Zoologists will tell you that tree frogs make such boxes
which they employ in their mating activities (I can’t go into
detail about it in this family newspaper) but the eminent an-
thropological team, Mr. and Mrs. Walther Sigafoos (both he
and she are named Walther) were convinced that this particular
box was made not by tree frogs but by Neanderthal men. To
prove their point, they switched on the box and out came
television, which, as everyone knows, was the forerunner of fire.

If there is anything more you need to know about anthro
pology, just climb up or my lap as soon as my son leaves

The makers of Marlboro Cigarettes who sponsor this column, often
with trepidation, are not anthropologists. They are tobacconists—
good ones, I think—and I think you'll think so too when you sample
their wares—available wherever cigarettes are sold in all fifty
states.

Alford Predicts “Third Man’ |

In Future Campus Elections

By PETE ALFORD

The election is over. In the past

this has been the time for all those

issues and propo-|

% sals which seemed

: so paramount for |

ss } a week to slip into

* obscurity. Will

. — it happen again
5 this year?

Mr. Noell, Mr.
Supak, and Mr.
Wright who claim
to be Progressives
; and ran this week

Alford on a fairly con-

crete platform of

things they want to see enacted by

next year’s Executive Committee.

This time it might be different. We
hope so.

 

There are several general obser-
vations that can be made about
the election. The first is the truely
amazing turnout at the polls. In
the law school we are informed
all but seven students exercised
their right to vote.

A total of only fifty student or so
in the entire university didn’t go to
the Student Union yesterday and
cast a ballot. We feel this is due
in part to the fine candidates on
both sides and the issues discussed,

was due to the fact that with a
nine-nine split in the houses, the
NFU and law school vote became
more important.

The fraternities generally vote
to the man every year, but with
the two parties more equal in
numbers than they have been the
non-fraternity and law vote be-
comes more important.

Both parties are going to have to
realize that the NFU and law school
will have to be behind them if they
expect to win. For years the Univer-
sity party has tried to placate the
law school by including one on the
ticket, but this year even that didn’t
work.

In the distant future we can
