Charlie Byrd
To Play Here
This Saturday

By STEVE GUILD
Managing Editor

Charlie Byrd, well-known jazz and
classical guitarist, will appear in
concert at Washington and Lee to-
morrow afternoon from three to five
o'clock in Doremus Gymnasium.

The concert, which is sponsored by
both the Concert Guild and_ the
Student War Memorial Scholarship
Fund Committee, is being held to
raise money for the student schol-
arship fund which was established
after the second World War to honor
those Washington and Lee alumni
who gave their lives in the War.

Byrd, who will appear with his ac-
companists, plays regularly at the
Showboat Lounge, where he began
his career, in Washington, D.C. In
addition to his nightly performance
at the Showboat Byrd has recorded
several record albums, most notable
of which are Jazz at Showboat, Byrd
in the Wind,” and Charlie Byrd at
the Village Vanguard.

Byrd’s popularity stems partly from
the fact that he is an artist in two
fields. His classical style is not as
good as Seovia or Montaya, but he
was a one-time student of Segovia
and has been noted as the most per-
fected and versitile guitarist in the
music world tody. Byrd plays both

 

See page 4

 

jazz and classical in the “finger
style,” without the aid of a_ pick,
which enables him to blend the clas-
sical and jazz techniques.

Byrd has been playing at the
Showboat since 1957, and the large
crowds at the Lounge every eve-
ning attest to his great popularity.
This is increased by the vast tech-
nical knowledge which Byrd has of
the guitar and he achieves a greater
variety of music by alternating the
amplified and unamplified guitar.

Accompanying Byrd at the concert
will be his trio consisting of Keter

Betts, bass; Buddy Deppenschnidt,
drum; and Bill Summers at the
piano.

Tickets for the concert are three
dollars a couple and $1.75 for a
single admission. The tickests are
available at the Co-op, from mem-
bers of SWMSFC, or at the door
of Doremus Gym Saturday after-
noon

Members of the W&L Concert
Guild and their dates will be ad-
mitted without charge.

Most Dynamic Group
Since Kingston Trio

By JIM LEDBETTER
News Editor

The Friday night concert of Springs dance set will feature
the vocal and instrumental talents of one of the fastest-rising
folk singing groups on the horizon today: the Journeymen.

_ The concert will take place in Doremus Gymnasium, from
——~—*8-10 p.m. on April 19.

The Journeymen, who have an
exclusive recording contract with
Capitol Records, have released two
albums to date, which have both
been on the best-seller lists. One of
their singles, “Kumbahya,” was on
the top ten for several weeks—a re-
markable achievement in the folk
field.

Interpretation

Aside from their technical virtu-
osity, the appeal of the Journeymen
lies in their ability to interpret a
song for an audience, recreating the
time and place with remarkable
accuracy. With the impact of a tat-
tered photograph, they recall the
images of an age long gone; their
folk singing is almost mystically
redolent of the smoke, sweat and
tears of spent wars and unremem-
bered loves.

Though the Journeymen have
registered sensationally in the folk
field, they’re equally adept at pop
ballads ,blues and modern jazz. They
are in the process now of recording
an album of mood and cocktail mu-
sic, much of which they have writ-
ten themselves. Unlike contempor-
aries who have succeeded on exuber-
ance alone, they possess sound vocal
equipment. Their voices together, or,
more to the point, in solo, are pleas-
ing, melodious, and _ virile.

A Trio

The three—John Phillips, Richard
Weissman and Scott McKenzie—met
at a New York recording session and
soon formed a collaboration based

on their mutual regard for folk
music.

Phillips, acknowledged leader of
the group, had been an all-state

basketball and track star at neigh-
boring University of Virginia and
George Washington U. He received
a Presidential appointment to An-
napolis, but injuries sustained in
an intramural game forced him to
drop out during his second year.
It was then that he gave himself
up wholly to music, and particularly
the native American folk tunes he
learned as a child in Alexandria, Va.
John’s own songs and arrangements
comprise much of the celebrated
material in the  Journeymen’s
repertoire.

Dick Weissman represents the aca-
demic and historical approach to
folk themes. He’s won respect as a
musicologist with his extensive com-
pilations of pre-Civil War tunes. A
native of Philadelphia, he studied
at that city’s Conservatory of Mu-
sic, Vermont’s Goddard College and
Columbia U.

McKenzie

Also an accomplished musician
and like Phillips, a native of Virginia,
is Scott McKenzie. The wanderer and
comic spirit of the group, Scott
once seemed to collect prep schools,

colleges, and universities as other
people collect empty bottles. Pre-
viously, he had sung lead in a big-
name vocal group and toured the
night club circuit.

The Journeymen’s discoverer is
Frank Werber, manager of the fa-

mous Kingston Trio.

Werber says, “The Journeymen

ized field before the Kingston Trio

A Vocal Challenge To The IFC:
Is Full Potential Being Used?

That the IFC has escaped

the usual barrage of criticism

this year is perhaps a promising sign. Known in the past as
a rubber stamp for the faculty, the Council is beginning to
get back on the right track and regain some of its lost respect.

Despite this propitious omen, however, there still remains

a great deal of potential which

the IFC is not putting to use.

Some awareness of this unexercised potentiality was brought
out in last week’s faculty-student conference on fraternities.
Discussion centered on the three areas of scholarship, pledging,
and the assimilation of the non-fraternity men into the uni-
versity. What results will come out of this discussion, neverthe-

less, remain to be seen.

IFC President Ross Kyger commented last week that the
conference produced a number of “‘concrete ideas’ on ways
to improve the fraternity system at W&L. These ideas, he ex-
plained, will be compiled and studied by a “special committee”’
of the IFC. We trust that this committee will be an exception

to the many IFC ‘“‘committees’

’ of the past which have been

the stopping point of much constructive action.

A Pat On The Back To Macon

For ‘Image Of America’ Forum

We join the Tuesday Edition in commending the students
of Randolph-Macon Woman’s College for initiating and spon-
soring this weekend’s ‘Image of America” conference. The
slating of top-notch speakers insures that the conference will
be extremely rewarding. We urge that Washington and Lee be
well represented at this occasion.

While Washington and Lee is not geared to the same
scheduling of classes as Randolph-Macon, there are many
possibilities that may be explored for the establishment of a
similar program. The institution of a program such as this

could be both helpful and rewarding.

Language Studies Augmented
By New Laboratories In duPont

The very first foreign language
lesson students receive in Washing-
ington and Lee’s ultra-modern elec-
tronic language laboratory strangely
enough is not on tape.

It’s a “no smoking” warning— ap-
propriately given in the languages
taught through the facilities of the
laboratory. The warning takes the
form of colorful, handlettered signs
in French, German, Italian, Russian

and Spanish, and the signs are post-| >
ed in stragetic places along the walls]

of the laboratory. For the beginning
student who may be unable to trans-
late any of the foreign language
posters—one of the signs is in Eng-
lish.

A Washington and Lee German
instructor, David B. Dickens, lettered

the signs for the laboratory. The no'™

smoking rule is in force for the 42-
booth laboratory to prevent damage
to the sensitive microphones, tape
recorders and other instruments in
student booths, according to Prof.

Stuart Stephenson, assistant profes-| '
sor of German who coordinates the ||

laboratory work.
The laboratory, available for in-

struction in all the foreign languages | |
offered at Washington and Lee, is| |

housed in a large converted clasroom
in the university’s duPont Hall. The
laboratory is open daily and Sunday
nights for class instruction, study
and review.

Half of the laboratory’s booths are
equipped with individual tape re-
corders for students’ use, and each
booth has a microphone and ear-
phones plus accompanying controls.
All the booths may be controlled
from the instructor’s console and it
is possible to teach four classes at
the same time. Normally, not more
than two classes—relatively small
conversation sections—use the labor-
tory simultaneously, Prof. Stephen-
son noted.

The instructor, through switches at
his console, is able to monitor a

 

selected student during a class per-

 

Criticism Of Commons Considered Valid
Only Concerning Food, But Not Function

By GARETH ADEN
Associate Editor

Last Tuesday, I read a column by
a fellow freshman criticizing not
only the food at the Commons, but
the function of the Commons as
well. Now no one in the Freshman
Class more willingly admits to the
poor quality of the Slater food than
I; however, there was much in
this article with which I disagree.

First of all, no one is required
to eat in the Commons as the article
stated. What is required is that every
freshman pay for his meals there.
He can then eat anywhere he
chooses, at the fraternity house or
in town. It is unfortunate, though,
that most students simply do not
have the money to pay for two meals
every time they eat.

Fraternities Not Hurt

Half of the column was spent in
arguing that the Commons had
“strangled” fraternities because
freshmen no longer ate at the house
as they used to. This statement is
not true. I know of no fraternities
that have folded because of this
switch ,nor any even on the brink
of financial disaster for this reason.
The fact is the change was made
smoothly with the fraternities mere-
ly preparing less food than before.

The writer stressed the point that
a vital “contact” between freshmen
and upperclassmen had been lost
since the advent of the Commons. I
feel exactly the opposite is true;
in fact, it seems to me that the
greatest function the Commons serv-

 

es is that of giving the freshmen
a chance to eat together. We have
plenty of time to get to know our
older brothers after meals and on
weekends. Too soon we will all be
drawn into a close-knit fraternity
group. What we need in our fresh-
man year is a chance to get to know
as many people as possible. This
chance is provided for by a Com-
mons system.

Important to NFU

It might be good to point out here
also how much the commons has
helped the non-fraternity man, who
now has a chance to eat with his
fraternity classmates

Convenient Location

Another thing to consider is the
central location of the Commons.
It is not at all hard for a freshman
to walk quickly there to eat, but
what if he had to walk across town
and back every time he wanted a
meal?

Finally the Slater System was at-
tacked because it was a profit-mak-
ing institution. This to me was about
like criticizing the medical profes-
sion because the doctors make mon-
ey. Let’s not forget that the Slater
System hires people whom they must
pay and there must make some
profit. The question really ought to
to be—how much does this profit
making reflect itself in the quality
of the food?

Room For Complaint
Here obviously there is much
room for complaint. In general, the

meals are not good and on occa-
sion are very poor. No one really
enjoys eating a stale rice pudding
with water residue on top, or ba-
nanas topped with mayonaise, pea-
nuts, and a cherry. The freshman
is obviously not getting the quality
food he might expect at a school
of Washington and Lee’s calibre.
What is wrong? My guess is that
it is not the idea or function of
the Commons, but rather the quality
of the food served there. It is time
that either the Slater System or,
if necessary ,the Administration do
something to soothe the writhing

 

stomachs of so many starving fresh-
men. |

Don’t Disparage

It Could Be A Sign Of Genius

By PETE ALFORD
Friday Columnist
It seems to me that an inordinate
amount of time is being spent in
the Ring-tum Phi and around the
campus discussing
the length of stu-
dents’ hair. To me
this seems a very
shallow way to
evaluate a man’s
academic ability or
interest in Wash-
ington and Lee.
True, if unruly
hair and a fuzzy
J or _ uninterested
mind accompany
Abed each other, there
is room for criticism; but some of the
worlds most prominent figures—-
both past and present—have had
long, sometimes messy hair.

On our own we cite the Kennedy
family as a group which looks like
they all lost their barbers. On the
conservative side Everett Dirksen
sports an unmanageable thatch of
white, and he still holds an im-
portant position in the Senate.

Einstein is another prime example
of a great man whose mind seemed
to function properly even though his
hair was all over the area.

Futhermore, if we examine the
highest echelons of European intel-
lectuals and social life we find that

   

 

longer hair is the vogue. Not that,

 

By JOHN KIRKLEY

What would you do if a rhinoceros
suddenly appeared on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus, thundering
along the colonnade one Spring day?

In his play Rhinoceros Eugene
Ionesco dramatizes the changes
which occur in a small town when
such a perissodactyl does in fact ap-
pear. At first there is amazement
and consternation; men reckon what
it did and meant. Some suggested
that the authorities be called in.
Then another appears.

Incident

During an office scene the next
day, there is a discussion of the
Rhino-incident as reported in the
newspapers; one man, Bothrd, re-
fused to believe the printed stories,
even when his fellow-workers, Ber-
enger and Daisy, who were eye
witnesses, swear to the truth of the
story.

Another man, Boeuf, is not at
work that day; his wife bustles into
the office in tears. Shortly thereafter,
Boeuf arrives at the office: he has
become a _ rhinoceros. Eventually
everyone in town and in the sur-
rounding countryside joins the
movement; some are converted for
personal reasons, some for the sake

 

see no harm in it and really want
to be like everyone else anyway.

Freedom

After all, why should not a man
become a rhinoceros, especially if
everyone else is? Are not they, after
all, live creatures like ourselves?
Do not rhinoceroses have feelings
too? Why shouldn’t a man be al-
lowed to become whatever he
wishes—don’t we believe in individ-
ual freedom?

Finally there is only one human
being left—only one of all the men,
women, and children, all the doctors,
shopkeepers small businessmen po-
litical leaders society leaders, teach-
ers. This man, Berenger, refuses to
give up his human identity, refuses
to relinquish his individuality, his
freedom to be different, unusual, odd,
peculiar. At the end he eries, as
the curtain falls, “I’m the last man
left and I’m staying that way until
the end. I’m not capitulating!”

The most obvious point of Rhi-
noceros is our dangerous trend to-
wards conformity; men often seek
escape from freedom by losing
themselves in the masses or in mass
movements, such as communism,
fascism, or perhaps americanism.
“Faddism” is prevalent in America;
perhaps the hula hoop and frisbee

were innocent fads, but we must ask

Long Hair—

we should imitate everything that
is European, but we have always
adopted much from the countries
across the Atlantic, and we venture
to say we will continue to do so.

Condemn not a person solely on
the length of his hair as a tradition
breaker anti-conventionalist. Con-
ventions change and we must be
prepared to change along with them.

‘Rhinoceros’ By Eugene Ionesco
The ‘Dangerous Move Toward Conformity’

ourselves if we do not choose our
political leaders in the same spirit
of shallow, sudden enthusiasm with
which we purchase fad-items.

Freshmen

At Washington and Lee freshmen
often acquire, or develop further,
the pernicious habits of smoking and
excessive drinking, usually under
the pressure of example and under
the mantle of tolerance. The extent
to which pressure towards conform-
ity exists on this campus was in-
dicated by an editorial in the edi-
tion of this paper last Tuesday; stu-
dents were reminded that they were
supposed to wear shirts of a “sub-
dued color.”

First, white is not a color: should
we ban white shirts? Next, who shall
decide on the acceptability of the
popular and_ yellow — strawberry
colored shirts? Perhaps in the future
the Assimilation Committee will
regulate all purchases at the College
Town Shop and Thomas, Ltd. and
require all freshmen to buy their
clothes there. Maybe we could even
develop a school uniform of blaz-
er, blue shirt (button down)—or
perhaps white with a certain width
of blue stripe—Old George tie, dark
slacks, socks, and weejuns.

The brutalization of man, another

 

theme in Ionesco’s play, is evidenced

fessionally-made tapes and records
of those made by instructors. The
teacher’s microphone enables him to
speak to the class to the the indi-
vidual students.

Language laboratories have be-
come a common feature in most col-
leges and many high schools in the
past few years. Washington and Lee’s
installation has grown from a small
console-listening unit given by a
student's father in 1960. The initial
unit still sees service in another room
in duPont Hall.

“A laboratory of this type ean be
a highly efficient teaching method,”
Prof. Stephenson observed. “It cer-
tainly stimulates enthusiasm in the
students.”

Some language students are asked
to purchase their own reels of tape
for study. The student-owned tape

MH) serve as the basis for “comparison
| recording.” For this type of study

exercise the student records trans-
missions from the master console,
plays them back, listens and re-
cords his repetitions. After class, the
student is able to listen to his
repetitions and compare them with
the recording to increase his lan-
guage fluency. The laboratory fur-
nishes other tapes for student use.
Language profesors at Washing-
ton and Lee are especially enthus-
iastic about using the laboratory’s
facilities for introducing students to
plays, operas, novels and poetry of
other languages and cultures.

Letters
To The
Editor...

 

 

 

 

Gentlemen:

Roger Payne's recent letter con-
cerning conventional dress has
brought several thoughts on the
subject to my mind.

First, is conventional dress really
a tradition? Traditions, by their very
nature, do not need to be defined
in systematized codes or be enforced
by various coercive means. Our con-
ventional dress “tradition” seems,
therefore, to be but a regulation.

Second ,is all change to be forbid-
den on this campus? Are not all
regulations at W&L subject to
change as both the student body and
society in general change? To be
effective to be respected, regulations
must be adapted to meet the needs
of the social unit which they attmpt
to regulate. I suggest that the stu-
dent body at W&L is changing, and
that the regulations should reflect
this.

Roger Payne feels that we should
support “those customs which have
made this school what it is.” Cer-
tainly W&L’s standing as a univer-
sity should not be based solely on
customs. If it is thus based, I feel
that change is definitely necessary to
to base our standing on values more
educationally significant.

Ionesco’s rhinoceroses could only
communicate with one cnother by
gutteral bellows and trumpetings of
a vaguely emotional content. This is
probably his single most damning
indictment against modern mass so-
ciety, and it certainly applies to a
large portion of our student body.

I have consistently attempted to
stimulate conversation on topics of
more-than-passing interest during
lunch hour in the Commons; most
freshmen are amazed by the ques-
tions, think I must be joking; and
then when they do realize I am
serious, they quickly run short of
pertinent remarks. Nor are the
freshmen the only inarticulate seg-
ment of our college generation.

Conformity, mindlessness, insensi-
tivity, and a breaking down of com-
munication between individuals are
the modern trends attacked in
Ionesco’s Rhinoceros, Man is, in
short, becoming encrusted.

Taking its place with the other
spring sports, baseball has begun
at W&L. The team has been prac-
ticing since Feb. 25 both indoors
and out.

As for material, the team is hurt-
ing from lack of experience. Al-
though strong at third base and
pitcher, the team has yet to fill out
its other positions. Returning from
last year is the captain, Chuck
Lane, who has lettered for three
years. The pitching position is dom-
inated by three southpaws and two
right handers. Sophomores Mason
McGown, Chris Wigert, and Lou
Paterno will help mound strength a
lot.

The big question this year is the
catching spot. Returning to this
position is George Allen. Freshman
Pete Hendricks is a promising
candidate for the receiving end of
the battery. Other promising fresh-
men are Eric Sisler, Danny Nied-
ringhaus, and John Crothers.

The Generals face an unusually

W&L’s only loss came at the

 

tough schedule this year facing
teams such as East Carolina, Old
Dominion, University of Connecticut,
and Georgetown. According to Coach
Lyles there will not be a "breather”
all season.

The main problem this year is
defense. Many lettermen are being
moved to new positions that they
are unfamiliar with. Last year’s
problem was fundamentals and it
appears as if the team will be
facing the same situation this year.
Fundamentals are 85 per cent of
a good, defensive ball game. An-
other problem is hitting. The Gen-

By DICK KREITLER

On Wednesday night, Phi Kappa
Psi clinched the intramural wrest-
ling championship for the third
straight year as it downed Delta
Tau Delta, 24-8, in the finals.

Led by Pete Alford, Chick
Owens, Bill Jamison, Ernie Lever-
ing and Tom Clements, Phi Psi
won the double elimination tour-
nament as it knocked off Phi Kap,
KA and Delt in succession.

In Wednesday night’s match, Phi
Psi picked up a quick five points as
Delt forfeited the 123 lb. division to
Pete Alford. Alford incidentally
turned in a 7-1 record this season;
all of his victories were by pins.

Mike Harris then came through
with another pin for the Psi’s. He
pinned Lee Johnson early in the
second period.

With victory already in its hands,
Phi Psi didn’t let up. Ernie Lever-
ing outmaneuvered Dan Manson of
Delt, and turned in an impressive
3-1 victory for Phi Psi.

For the last match, Phi Psi heavy-
weight Tom Clements pinned Carroll

their match.

“Your Campus Neighbors”

By TOM DAY

With the hopeful early arrival of
warm weather and the thawing of
winter snows, spring sports make
their annual debut at W&L. Possibly
the man looking forward to spring
with the most anticipation, in addi-
tion to the captain of the G.B.D.T.,
is varsity lacrosse coach Bob
McHenry. Coach McHenry looks
forward to a much improved season
and an equally improved team. “With
a few breaks and some good games
we could finish with an even .500
record,” says the coach. He also
added that with the material he has
to work with the team ought to be
able to better last years 1-11 record.

There are 38 out for practice,
a lot more than many previous
seasons. Among these are 12 re-
turning lettermen. The return of
Johnny McDaniel makes the
midfield look exceptionally strong
Among the freshmen out for the
team Jay Bowersox, Doug Mor-
rison, and Tersh Baker seem to be
the most promising. Bowersox and
Morrison play midfield and Baker
concentrates on defense. The fact
that many of the players have
never picked up a lacrosse stick
before and are now playing reg-
uarly is indicative of the good

enthusiasm of the players. |

The schedule for this year has!
been greatly revised. Johns Hopkins |
has dropped us because of traveling
difficulties and we have dropped the
University of Massachusetts, Brown,
and the Australians. To fill out the |
holes in the schedule the team has
added New Hampshire, Townshed
and various other schools. Possibly
the two toughest teams the Gener-
als face will be Baltimore College
and UVa.; both have the potential of
becoming first in the nation so the
stickmen will have their work cut
out for them in these two encounters.

The loss of goalie Ray Miller
presents the biggest question of re-
building. It will be remembered
that Miller made the second team
All-American. Nevertheless, Coach
McHenry feels he has good goalie
material in Butch West and hopes

that West will be able to fill the
big hole left by Miller’s graduation.
The Generals will also miss the
services of Charlie Gummey, one
of this year's tri-captains. The two
other captains are Dan Reed and
Bob Van Rensselaer.

According to coach McHenry if the
weather stays the way it has been
the team will have much more time
to devote to the basic fundamentals
and save the playmaking for later.
This will strengthen the individual
players ball handling. So, with the
odds in their favor the team should
be prepared to put on a good show-
ing in their scrimmage on March 26.
