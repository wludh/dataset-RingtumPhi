Extra Costumes
For Dance Set
Available Soon

The Dance Board is working on
getting more costumes to add to the
already record-breaking number and
announcement of a new date for
ordering them should come within
a week, according to Dance Board
Vice President Ed Croft. The cos-
tumes already ordered are in “good
shape,” and the special costumes
for the figure are ready, said Croft.

ROTC Allows Beards

He also announced that the ROTC
Department has agreed to let the
cadets grow beards if they obtain
a release slip from Supply Sergeant
J. E. McSheffrey. They must have
these slips in order to be excused
for “no shave” at drill.

Fancy Dress will be kicked off
this year by a cocktail party at
| the Mayflower in honor of Fancy
Dress President Ham Emory. A
highlight of the party will be the
naming of five playmates in going
along with the Playboy theme of
the party.

at this year’s Fancy Dress and that

day evening concert and the jazz

the best Fancy Dress in years.

He added that because of the
large turnout expected at this year’s
ball, they are eliminating the rows
of chairs that lined the dining hall
at last year’s ball.

Fancy Dress will feature the big
band sound of Count Basie, the sing-
ing of Nina Simone, and the dixie-
land jazz of the Tigertown Five.

Dr. Luke E. Steiner will talk on “We Need Intellectuals” Monday at
8 p.m. Tuesday, he will discuss “Applications of Radio-isotopes to the Study
of Chemical Problems” in an 11:10 a.m. class. Both talks will be in Howe
Hall and will be open to the public.

A graduate of Oberlin College, Dr. Steiner held a National Science
Foundation Faculty Fellowship at the University of Leiden in 1957-58. He
received his Ph.D. degree from Yale University.

W&L Contributes 30% Of County Christmas Charity

Some 300 needy Rockbridge County families had a happier Christmas
this year partly because of the contributions of Washington and Lee stu-
dents through the Interfraternity Council. Of the annual Rockbridge
Christmas Basket Program that furnishes $2,000 of food and toys to
indigent area families, students gave $600 this year. The University
Christian Association’s Candlelight Service offering also was given to the
program.

This year was the first time the IFC voted to let each of the fraternities
decide its own contribution to the program—in past years each house had
given a fixed amount. In some cases the amounts given this year tripled the
fixed amounts of past Christmases. VMI also contributes to the program.

prer Digest

Presents Award

The Washington and Lee depart-
ment of journalism and communica-
tions has received a $1,000 grant
from the Reader’s Digest.

The gift will provide traveling and
living expenses for journalism stu-
dents working on out-of-town re-
search and reporting projects, ac-
cording to Prof. O. W. Riegel, head
of the department. Reader’s Digest
awards a limited number of these
grants ranging from $500 to $1,000
annually to selected schools and de-
partments of journalism for the pur-
pose of broadening the scope of stu-
dent training.

“We welcome the fund as a means
for furthering research by students
on public issues,” Prof. Riegel said.
“While our setting has many advan-
tages, close proximity to sources of
national and international news is
not one of them. The fund will help
to remedy this disadvantage.”

Students qualifying for aid from
the new fund will be given specific
assignments in news centers, in-
cluding Richmond, Washington and
New York. They will report in depth
on subjects assigned, in the form of

Reynolds Price To Lecture In duPont

The Washington and Lee

Seminars in Literature program

received enthusiastic praise upon its publication last year.

ROTC Corps

 

To Reorgantize

Lt. Colonel Jack P. Burch, new
Professor of Military
W&L, has announced a reorganiza-

tion plan for the Corps of Cadets
to go into effect during the second

semester.

Under the new command struc-

ture, a brigade consisting of two

troop battalions will be created to
replace the current one battalion

set-up. Although new headquarters

elements will be introduced, the
cadets will continue to be organized
into four troop companies and a
Band Company as in the past.
Opportunities for Promotion
The purpose of the reorganization,

- aecording to Col. Burch, is to provide

opportunities for a number of mid-
year cadet promotions. The new
battalion headquarters and the bri-
gade headquarters will be staffed by
cadet officers selected on the basis
of merit and overall demonstrated
performance. Among the higher
ranking cadet officers will be one

full Colonel, three Lt. Colonels, and
four Majors. The brigade structure |

will allow more cadets the chance
to practice leadership in the exer-

cise of new command responsibilities
| than previously. |
“It is anticipated that this same

technique of using a single four-
company battalion the first semester
followed by a two-battalion brigade
in the second semester will be used
in subsequent school years,” Col.
Burch said.

a long period of amnesia to reclaim
a name, a fortune, and a wife which
are no longer his.

On January 18 two other French
films are scheduled to be shown.
They are “Le Chevre de M. Seguin”
and “Paris 1900,” a pre-World War
I documentary. They will also be
shown in duPont Auditorium.

public.

Price, who has also written a
number of short stories, has had
stories published in two O. Henry
Prize Award volumes and in the
English monthly magazine Encount-
er, among others.

He was recently awarded the Sir
Walter Raleigh prize in North Car-
olina for his work.

A Long and Happy Life was pub-
lished last spring by Athenaum, the
publication coinciding with the
novel’s appearance in Harper’s Mag-
azine. It was the first time that
Harper’s had ever printed an entire
novel in a single issue.

Book Award Nominee

The novel has been nominated for
the 1962 National Book Award. It’s
praise has been effusive and close to
unanimous. Leaders in literary cir-
cles including Stephen Spender, Lord
David Cecil, and Eudora Welty have
“singled it out for special comment
and commendation.”

Spender said: “I think this is the
most remarkable novel by a young
writer which I have read for many
years. It is a most moving and dis-
turbing love story, told with com-
pelling observation, sharp and orig-
inal humor, and deep feeling.”

Price has been generally accorded
a place among the several brilliant
young writers in the United States
today. Others in this generation in-
clude Philip Roth and John Updike.

The novel is set in Warren County,
North Carolina, and concerns a
young woman whose intense love for
a man who doesn’t seem to return
her love causes her both joy and
sorrow.

May Be Filmed

Price is now working on a collec-
tion of short stories and a new novel.
The New York Times reported some
months ago that there are plans for
making A Long and Happy Life into
a movie.

Later this year Price will be
reading at the Young Men’s Hebrew
Association in New York. The
YMHA has recently drawn Kather-
ine Anne Porter and James Baldwin
as readers.

Price was born in 1933 and gradu-
ated from Duke University in 1955.
For the next three years he studied
at Oxford University as a Rhodes
Scholar, receiving his Bachelor of
Letters degeree from Oxford in
1958. He returned to teach at Duke;
spent the session of 1961-62 in
England, and is now a member of
the English faculty at Duke.

Second Seminar of Year

 

Price’s appearance is the second
this semester under the Seminars
in Literature program. Shortly be-

fore Christmas the program featured
the leading critic Northrup Frye,
who spoke on “The Structure of
Imagery in Modern Poetry.” Frye’s
talk was given in the same week
as the Glasgow Series of appear-
ances of three American poets.

Last year the English writer Colin
| Wilson spoke under the auspices of
| the Seminars program.

 

Exhibit Features Orientals

Prints by contemporary Oriental
artists living and working in the
Western world will be on display in
Washington and Lee University’s
duPont Art Gallery during January,

The exhibition—titled “The East
in the West’—includes some 40
prints on loan from the Ferdinand
Roten Galleries in Baltimore, Md.
The show is sponsored by the uni-
versity’s department of fine arts.

Colored etchings, lithographs and
wood blocks are included in
month-long exhibit, according to Dr.
Marion Junkin, head of the Wash-
ington and Lee fine arts department.
The prints will be for sale during
the exhibition.

Post World War Hl
The exhibit, the fifth in the duPont

gallery since September, offers a
look at the work of a number of
successful Oriental artists of the

post-World War II era.
Sugai, Zao-Wou-Ki, Hamaguchi,
Uchima, Moti and Kobashi are
among those being displayed.

The November duPont exhibition
featured traditional prints by Japa-
nese artists. The current print show
is modern and designed to contrast
i the two Oriental styles.

Everbody—at Washington and Lee, anyway—knows what's |

meant when they hear the term ‘Minks.’ That’s what the
Veemies call the students, and what they’ve been calling them
for some time.

And everyone knows, too, what Keydets, Wahoo, Ring-
tum Phi, etc. suggest. The Keydets are the Cadets, the Wahoos
are the UVa. students, and the Ring-tum Phi—well, that’s us.

But where did these words come from? It’s easy to see
keydet-cadet derivation, but the origins of the others are (to us)
lost in obscurity.

And that’s the point of this editorial. We are interested
in finding out just how these words came into common usage.
If any of our readers know the origin of these or other oft-
repeated words that have interesting stories behind them,
let us know. We're sure there are readers in the dark who are
just as curious as we, and we would like to fill them in.

 

A Dance Suggestion

Beginning next year, the presidents of the sophomore,
junior and senior classes will serve as presidents of Openings,
Springs and Finals dance weekends as well.

We feel that this Dance Set innovation will be a decided im-
provment over the old system of electing fraternity and party-
supported individuals to head up big weekends.

However, we would like to mention an additional change
that has been suggested to us.

In the past, it has oftentimes been a real strain financially
on the house with the dance set president. Men in such houses

have sometimes been assessed as much as $50 per person for
the weekend cocktail party, traditionally held by the president’s
fraternity.

Instead of being financed by a single house, the cocktail
parties could be paid for by an entire class—thus easing the
burden on both individuals and fraternities.

We sincerely hope that this idea will at least be considered
when the new system of class presidents as dance set presi-
dents is instituted. It seems logical that since a class is sponsor-

Simple, ordinary, plain—but Mr.

his characters alive in a way I have
never seen before. He has a fresh,

distinctive. He uses dashes and
“ands” and commas without reserve,
giving the impression of what his

character’s thought pattern is.

week of films in store.

he can create a story, which despite

Letters to the Editor

 

Honor System Labeled ‘Punitive’

there is the aspect of the absolute in
the rendering of judgment upon an
individual, and whenever any human |
society takes such irrevocable au- |
thority unto itself, it behooves that |
society and those individuals who
render the judgment to be both|
humble and circumspect in the ex-
treme.

(Editor’s note: Although
the Honor System at Washing-
ton and Lee has always been
regarded as particularly a stu-
dent province, the Ring-tum
Phi is glad to have a member
of the faculty express his own
personal views on this or any
other subject.)

To the Editor:

In your editorial of December 11
the statement was made that “the
honor system is not a disciplinary
or legal system.” Ideally speaking
the statement is true. Ideally it is
to be hoped that the individuals
attracted to this school will be the
sort of persons in whom a sense of
the honorable in human conduct in-
heres—each and every one of whom
cherishes truth to the highest self
above all other considerations in
life, not just in the prescribed areas
of lying, cheating and stealing (all of
which are variations on “giving the
lie” to facticity, out of which arises
all sin), but in every human action
and relationship, secret or public, ;
whether here or away, or in the)
silent reflections of the inmost heart. |

his exclusion from this social organ- |

notion that his exclusion be for the |
purity of the body, and to speak of |
the unhappy deviant from the code
as if his presence has overnight be-
come an infectious threat to the
morality of his quondam fellows. |
None of us is so morally aseptic or
free of taint that we as a body need
such protection. |

the right to decide that, for what-
ever reason, such-and-such an in-
dividual does not belong within this
body. We may codify our rules as
we wish and demand that they be
respected. But if we live and define
our morality under God, as we claim
to do, from where do we pre-empt
the warrant to sit in irrevocable
judgment on any man in such a way
as to anathematize him for life?
Option Defended

To me it is deeply regrettable that
the option of voluntary withdrawal
from the student body was sus-
pended. The difference may seem
trifling to a casual bystander, but}

What impresses me, too, is that Mr.

uses long scenes to tell his story.
He keeps his characters relaxed and

Brian Kelley

Canadian Student Prefers
American Political System

By JIM DeYOUNG

The curious student is always anx-
ious to have a chance to associate
with a student from another coun-
try.

Brian Kelley, a first year law stu-
dent at Washington and Lee, from
Winnipeg, Canada, graduated from
the University of Manitoba and has
been a resident of this country since
last September.

But the most fascinating and in-
teresting fact about Brian is that
he is foregoing his Canadian citizen-
ship to become an American citizen.

Brian has been planning to become
an American since college, and he
eventually intends to practice law
somewhere in the United States.

Since he will graduate from law
school in two years, he will prob-
ably work for our government for
a couple of years until his five-year
residency requirement for citizen-
ship is completed.

Canada ‘Too Leftist’

Why has this young Canadian de-
cided to become an American citi-
zen?

Brian has very strong feelings
about the political situation in Cana-
da at the present. He is not pleased
with the government, which is po-
litically to the left. “The Canadian
government shirks its political re-
sponsibility,” he said.

He mentioned an active Socialist
party there and said that the lib-
erals and conservatives are anti-

| American in their platform and poli-

to know. Mr. Douglas is excellent. |
He plays his role with sincerity | people.
and integrity, and a certain bril-|

liance which makes one forget the|

his story with restraint, and built |

style to a screen which has long|

 

 

cies in order to please the Canadian

“There is hestiancy on their part
to back issues that should be back-
ed—the O.A.S., for instance—be-
cause the government feels that if
they did join this organization, they
would simply become a_ rubber
stamp for the United States.” he said.

Export Economy Unfavorable

He also cited the export economy
of Canada as unfavorable at this

 

time. Canada trades wheat with
Communist China, their biggest
wheat buyer, and also with Cuba in
non-strategic items, he added.

He thinks the Canadian govern-
ment is showing a soft approach to
Communism, and predicts that Prime
Minister Diefenbaker will be ousted
in the spring elections, and that
Lester Pearson and his liberals will
come to power.

Because Pearson is pro-American
and one of the founders of N.A.T.O.,
Brian hopes that some of the anti-
American and anti-British feeling
will eventually disappear. He feels
that this would help to improve the
overall climate of the entire country.

Majored in U.S. Polities

Brian exhibits a deep admiration
for the United States. His under-
graduate degree at the University
of Manitoba was in the American
side of political science and his
secondary major was in American
history. Out of this study came a
deep interest in the U.S., and one
of the reasons he came to Virginia
is because of its rich historical value.
He is very impressed with the South,
“its white-pillared mansions and
‘you all’ expressions” he has seen in
movies about the South.

Brian believes our government
knows what it is up against and that
it is willing to fight for what it
thinks is right. In Canada “they are
willing to compromise too much,” he
said.

This Area ‘Too Right Wing’

His only criticism of this part of
the country is that he feels that
there tends to be too strong a right
wing feeling here. He also thinks
there is too much strict adherence to
conservative policies in the South.

Brian feels strongly that “our peo-
ple are united in a_semi-cause
against communism,” and he admires
our Constitution and wants to live
under it. He feels he will do better
in this country, and that the United

Generals By
PMC, 76-68

Santa Claus paid Washington and
Lee’s basketball team a_ surprise
early visit December 18 and helped
the Generals to a 76-68 upset vic-
tory over Pennsylvania Military Col-
lege.

The Generals, who were held to
their lowest point total in five years
the night before by Catholic U. (a
65-41 loss), broke out of a five-
game losing string to post their sec-
ond win of the year.

Fauber Stars

Captain Rodger Fauber, guard
Brett Thackston, and center Howard
Martin starred in the W&L triumph.

Fauber poured in 26 points and |

collected 22 rebounds. Thackston
tallied 18 points, and Martin scored
14 points and grabbed a career-high
26 rebounds.

Martin, Fauber, and Thackston
scored all but four of W&L’s points
in the first half as the Generals
pulled into a 31-32 lead.

Free Throws Difference

In the second half, deadly ac-
curacy at the free throw line salted
away the win.

Fauber sank 11 of 13 charity tosses,
Thackston hit four of four, Martin
added a perfect two for two and
guard Louie Paterno made five of
seven. In all W&L converted 23
of 31 free throws in the half.

With Geno Zveced scoring PMC’s
first 12 points the military school
moved into an early lead. A jumper
by Thackston, however, put the

Gallaudet Saturday Night

Washington and Lee’s top notch

of the season Saturday night when
it travels to Gallaudet College.

The Generals have scored three
straight wins by topping North Car-
olina, 19-8, Old Dominion College,
17-11, and Pfeiffer, 26-6.

Best Balanced

Coach Dick Miller tabs this crew
as the “best balanced” team he has
had since he’s been at Washington
and Lee.

Four Wrestlers, Jud Babcock, Pete
Winfield, Tom Stover, and Herb
Smith, have turned in undefeated
seasons thus far. Butch West and
Dave Montgomery both have 2-1

High-Scoring Tiger Club
nvades W&L Tonight

Washington and Lee’s battle-scar-
red Generals return to cage war-
fare tonight against Hampden-Syd-
ney’s high flying Tigers.

The Tigers, who boast the nation’s
second best offense for
leges at 94.0 points per game, bring
a 7-3 record into the contest. W&L
is 2-6.

H-S Upset

Hampden-Sydney was upset by
Old Dominion College, 86-84, Sat-
urday night, therefore, the Tigers
may take their anger out on the
Generals.

Forward Tom Supak, who missed
seven of the eight games before
Christmas, is expected to see some
action tonight.

Big worry for Coach Bobby Mc-
Henry’s Generals is H.S. captain and
forward Bill Hardin. Hardin is ninth
in the nation in scoring average,
27.9, and fourth in free throw per-
centage.

Hampden-Sydney continued their
upward swing towards an outstand-
ing season with two tournament
championships—Fort Lee Invitation-
al and the North-South Holiday
Fiesta.

Tiger team effort saw them set a
new record at Fort Lee in total
points scored in three games with
258, breaking the record by three.

The Tigers also tied the most
field goals scored with 105, matching
Fort Lee’s output of last year. The
Tigers were the first civilian team
to win the tourney in its three-year
history. In doing so they defeated

All-Tournament team _ selections
consisted of three Tigers—Bill Har-
din who scored 56 points and grab-
bed 39 rebounds in two nights, Dave
Trickler, and Tom Quarles.

Nationally the Tigers rank sixth
in total offense with a 92.2 average.
Bill Hardin ranks number nine in
scoring with a 27.7 average, which
also makes him the leader in Vir-
ginia colleges. Hardin is also fifth
in free throw percentage with 32-35
and a 914 mark.

Winning streak of nine games
makes the Tigers a formidable foe
for small college teams in the state.
Two of the wins do not count in the
official season standings because they
were military teams.

Loves of Dobie Gillis,” etc.)

 

A GUIDE FOR THE UNMONEYED

R. L. Sigafoos was a keen, ambitious lad, and when he finished
high school he wished mightily to go on with his education. It
seemed, however, a forlorn hope. R. L.’s father could not send
the boy to college because a series of crop failures had brought
him to the brink of disaster. (R. L.’s father raised orchids which,
in North Dakota, is a form of agriculture fraught with risk.)
It was, therefore, squarely up to R. L. He could go to college
only if he worked his way through. This was a prospect that
dismayed him. He had a deep-seated fear that the task would
be too great, that he would never be able to carry on a full, busy
college life and still find time to do odd jobs and make money.
Racked with misgivings, R. L. paced the streets, pondering
his dilemma. One day, walking and brooding, he came upon a
park bench and sat down and lit a Marlboro cigarette. R. L.
always lit a Marlboro when he was low in his mind. R. L. also
always lit a Marlboro when he was merry. The fact is there is
no occasion—happy or sad, pensive or exuberant, cheery or
solemn—when Marlboro with its fine filter and fine flavor is
not entirely welcome, as you will discover when you go to your
favorite tobacconist and buy some, as we—the makers of
Marlboro and IJ and R. L. Sigafoos—hope you will do real soon.
Sitting and thinking and smoking a Marlboro on the park
bench, R. L. was suddenly interrupted by a small, quavering
voice which said, “My boy, you are troubled. Can I help?”

   

gti

Aten

Seated beside R. L. was a tiny, gnarled man with wispy,
snow-white hair. His skin was almost transparent, showing a
delicate tracery of fragile bones beneath. His back was bent,
and his hands trembled. But his eyes were bright and clear.
R. L. looked into those eyes, into the wrinkled face. He saw
wisdom there, and experience, and kindness. “Do you think,
sir,” said R. L., “that a boy can work his way through college
and still enjoy a rich, full campus life?”

“Why, bless you, son,” replied the stranger with a rheumy
chuckle, “of course you can. In fact, I did it myself.”

“Was it very hard?” asked R. L.

“Yes, it was hard,” the stranger admitted. “But when one
is young, all things are possible. I, for example, used to get up
at five o’clock every morning to stoke the furnace at the SAE
house. At six I had to milk the ewes at the school of animal
husbandry. At seven I gave a fencing lesson to the Dean of
Women. At eight I had a class in early Runic poets. At nine I
gave haircuts at the Gamma Phi Beta house. At ten I had dif-
ferential calculus. At eleven I posed for a life class. At twelve
I watered soup at the Union. At one I had a class in Oriental
languages. At two I exercised the mice in psych lab. At three
I gave the Dean of Women another fencing lesson. At four |
had qualitative analysis. At five I went clamming. At six I cut
meat for the football team. At seven I ushed at the movies, At
eight I had my ears pierced so that at nine I could tell fortunes
in a gypsy tearoom. At ten I had a class in astronomy. At
eleven I tucked in the football team. At twelve I studied and
at three I went to sleep.”

“Sir,” cried R. L., “I am moved and inspired by your shin-
ing example!”

“It was nothing,” said the stranger modestly, shaking his
frail white head. “It was just hard work, and hard work never
hurt anybody.”

“Would you mind telling me, sir,” said R. L., “how old you
are now?”
“Twenty-two,” said the stranger. @ 1963 Max Shulmas

Success... But Not Always
And his few failings in character-
ization lead to another weakness.
Mr. Price has to make his ordinary

people and events interesting. For
the most part he succeeds, but not
always. Once in awhile, his passages

seem a little boring.
On First Reading
On first reading I had thought
that he was much less successful in
the first third than in the other
two. For it is in the last two that
he gives us Rosacoke’s problem and

how she resolves it, and it is here
| that his writing is moving and more
poignant and here where he brings

me into his character. Also he be-
comes concerned with setting a
definite mood and he does this very
well.
On Second Reading

On second reading, however, I
found the whole to be enjoyable.
Mr. Price is a moving, compelling,
and interesting new writer with a
new style and he promises to be
one for a long time. He has written
an excellent novel.
