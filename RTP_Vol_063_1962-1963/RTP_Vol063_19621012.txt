‘Flu Shots

recommendation of medical
authorities, facilities have been *

t is strongly recommended
that all students take ad-

The influenza serum has been
found to be approximately 75
to 80 per cent effective. It
should be kept in mind that
since it takes two to three
weeks to build up any degree

take the shots after an epi-
demic has started.

Only those students with a
history of allergy to chick-

numerable dates October 19-20, the
weekend when Homecoming and
Opening Dances combine.

The entertainment for the dates

that, along with many combos.

The alumni will have tours, din-
ners, luncheons and football to en-
tertain them.

The IFC has announced that all
fraternities will participate in the
traditional decorations contest. A
team of judges will review the dec-

Politics?

Once again the campus is “alive” with political activity.
The two parties have selected their candidates and the cam-
paigns have begun. However, is this really the case? Certainly,
we have an election complete with candidates and posters, but
is it really a race?

Each year, the political groups on this campus get righteous
for a couple of days and put on a show for all of us to watch.
As far as we can remember, very little in a constructive way
is accomplished. The Honor System is lauded, apathy is at-
tacked, and the election is run.

Of course the parties make a few promises, but, by the
same token, very few of them are ever kept. It is rather shame-
ful to admit, but our campus elections all too often develop
into a power struggle between the two political groups or into
a popularity contest between the opposing candidates.

We must admit that the present political situation is un-
balanced. One of our parties enters any election with a com-
fortable margin. With this in mind, one would wonder of there
was any race at all. As is true with out state politics, the contest

is decided in the party caucus or in the primary.

Is this a healthy situation? Since the party alignment is
determined by fraternities and not by individuals, all too often
the voter has his mind made up for him.

It is our hope that the freshman class will enter this com-
ing election with an open mind. A vote should be cast for the

candidates as individuals, and not the political party.

 

 

 

Letters To The Editor oe

 

 

Honts Accuses R-t P
Of Collusion In Pic

Dear Editor:

I would like to explain the abso-
lute irrelevance of the picture ap-
pearing on page 1 of the Tuesday
Edition of the Ring-tum Phi. The
object of the picture was to give
publicity to the Southern Collegian,
I think, which the cutline did not
do.

While I certainly would b2 a fool
to object to the implication of the
cutline, I cannot take the credit for
implied action which did not occur.
I only took the girl’s picture.

It is my feeling that there was
collusion involved. Collusion by
Roger Paine et als., who think the
Collegian is unfit and non-intellec-
tual. I would therefore demand
an EC investigation of this person,
Paine, who is, I believe, responsible
for the cutline. If he is guilty, as I
supect he is, I feel it is only proper
that he be sentenced to reading
only that excellent competitor of
ours for the rest of the year. I
speak, of course, of Shenandoah.

Thank you for printing this letter
and I hope you'll be looking for
Sue in the Openings Issue.

Sincerely,
GEORGE HONTS, Editor
Southern Collegian

Approach Of NAACP
Viewed As Ineffective

Dear Editor:

I am writing this letter to find out
some information. What is the
NAACP trying to accomplish? I
thought that the NAACP was an
organization aimed at improving
the status of the American Negro.
To the contrary, it has succeeded
only in degrading and depriving
Negroes, and at the same _ time
alienating them from white so-
ciety.

Whenever the NAACP enters a
new campaign it is almost certain
that there will be trouble, and pos-
sibly violence. The headlines of
newspapers are filled with such
cases. The NAACP seems to thrive
on headlines. But are headlines and
violence going to help the Negro
gain acceptance?

Prince Edward County was the
scene of the first federal deseg-
regation fight. The NAACP moved
in and demanded immediate and
complete integration. The white pop-
ulation had formulated a plan of
partial and gradual integration, but
this plan was rejected by the
NAACP. The result was the clos-
ing of all public schools in the
county. Negroes have now been
without schools for almost five years.
State tuition grants available to all,
white or black, who wish to con-
tinue their education are denied the
Negroes by the NAACP. If they ac-
cept they lose their membership
and friends. Only now are the
Negroes of Prince Edward County
realizing the true nature of the
NAACP and deserting its ranks.

In Mississippi, the NAACP suc-
ceeded in enrolling the first Negro
student in the history of the Uni-

 

versity of Mississippi. This occured
only after federal troops, number-
ing in the thousands, were called
in, student riots broke out, and
two men lost their lives. This may
not have happened, you say, if
Governor Barnett had followed the
federal court order. However, it
could also have been prevented if
the NAACP had taken steps to inte-
grate on the elementary levels, and
not at the college level where all
feelings toward integration have
been formed and firmly encamped.

To me the NAACP is just another
radical organization looking for sen-
sation and headlines. The NAACP
is impersonal. It lives off the suf-
ferings of its race. It extracts mem-
bership dues from those who can
least afford it. What the Negro needs
is an organization that cares about
the individual. A respectable organ-
ization will be able to represent the
Negro and eventually gain the sup-
port of the white population.

By building up self-respect, in-
centive and ingenuity, the Negro
can make gradual strides toward de-
segregation. It is impossible to tear
down a wall of tradition overnight
especially one as great as that of
Southern society and culture. How-
ever, the NAACP is trying to erad-
icate it in one blow.

Sincerely,
LEWIS MILLER

Or

By KENNETH LANE
Asst. Managing Editor
Traditionally, the Editorial page
has tried to pay tribute to those
institutions on campus which play
a key role within the University.
It is with this in mind that we
salute one of our most instrumental
organizations—the “13” Club.
Because its particular field of
self-fulfillment is in the social cate-
gory, this secret society has lately
been underestimated. I am sure, for
example, that many readers smirk
when the ideals of such a club are
applauded. But why? How has “so-
cial” come to have such a spurious
connotation? Isn’t it just as im-
portant a part of college activity
as athletics or curricula?

In eulogizing the “13” Club, we
wish to perform a double service:
first, an objective evaluation of a
campus institution; secondly, an
ironing out of some common mis-
conceptions about the ideals for
which this institution stands.

In every phase of campus life,
recognition is given those who evi-
dence superiority. In the academics,
prestige for those who excel is of-
fered in the grading system. In ath-
letics, there are Varsity Sports and
honorable mention in newspaper ar-
ticles. And likewise in social, there
is the need for some way to dis-
tinguish the proficient.

Something to Strive For

The “13” Club is the key incen-
tive-building factor in this last
field. It is this prestige organization
which brings out the campus stud-
horses. Without something to strive
for, these men might never foresee
their true potential. The agonizing
Monday morning hangovers would
just be too much without having
some goal.

This competition to be selected
among the hard core of stallions is

weekend from the underclassmen.
In this way, the drive for social self-
realization kept on a_ healthy,
competitive pitch. No one can say
that the “13” Club isn’t doing its
job to check university apathy.

Yet with the changing times,
the Club has assumed an even
nobler cause. It stands against the
tide of public opinion, which is
threatening to take from youth
some of its valuable folkways.

For the modern trend in educa-
tion is becoming dangerously one-
directional. We have, the sages
claim, reached an age of speciali-
zation and tomorrow’s leaders must
be trained to perpetuate it. Conse-

is

 

quently, the academic standards
have been raised to unprecedented |
levels; the curricula have been}
tightened; and classroom competi- |
tion has reached a slavish intensity. |

Nevertheless, the “13” Club is
making a relentless stand. Boldly,|
it shouts Carlyle’s “Everlasting _
to an increasingly philistine society. |
In an environment which threatens |
to constrain individuality and re-|
duce human beings to atoms, the |
“13” Club remains adamant in its |
principles.

The Need To Survive
Washington and Lee has always |
prided itself in its liberal educa- |
tion. It is widely famous for pro-'

 

springing up new prospects every

ducing the all-around leaders. It
stands on the belief that what this
country really needs are men with
broad foundations. The University
should not retreat in these standards.

Admittedly, the outlook is not too
bright for the “13” Club. Last year,
one of its long-standing contempor-
aries, the “Mongolian Minks,” was
banned from the campus. Futher-
more, the high academic standards
are detracting from the other de-
partments of college.

But should the “13” ever die, it
will be a great loss to the Univer-
sity. For dying with it will be the
cause for which it stands— the
ideal of self-perfection in all ranges
of human experience.

chants to new students on the cam-
pus, the beanie is indicative of the
man, with whom the student body
and alumni are sharing the most
valuable conventions imaginable—
those which instill a sense of pride
in the individual—pride in him-
self as a man, and pride in this uni-
versity, which it is his calling to

argue well for the existence and
activity of any assimilation commit-

singly or in combination, these
things can destroy in an_ instant

what only decades have built. Those
who would characterize the commit-
tee as “The better clothes commit-

mittee” are missing the broader im-

both the maintenance of a signifi-
cantly unique institution, and the
preservation for future generations
of students of those traditions hav-
ing at their core a gentleman’s pride.

Sackett Named W eek’s Star
For Play In EGH Contest

For his fine play against Emory |
and Henry last Saturday, Henry
Sackett has been chosen by the
Washington and Lee coaches as the
athlete of the week.

Sackett highlighted his perfor-
mance last week with a_ninety-
three yard kick-

off return to start
the second half as
the Generals lost
a close 38-33
match.
The fleet half-
back also scored
on a one - yard
plunge in the first
period to give
himself a total of
twelve points for
the day.
Against Emory and Henry,
ket carried eight _times

 

Sackett

Sac-
for 47

 

yards and a highly respectable av-
erage of 5.9 yards per carry.

Sackett has been an outstanding
performer in all three games so
far, as he leads the team in scor-
ing with 22 points. He has carried
20 times this season gaining 126
yards for a 6.3 average.

He is second in the state scoring
race, behind Emory and Henry’s
Earl Hawkins.

Besides his rushing ability, Sac-
kett has been extremely valuable
for his kickoff returns and sharp
defensive play this season.

Note From The Past

In the 1916 season, forty-six
years ago, the Washington and

Lee Generals rolled over the Ran-
dolph-Macon Yellow Jackets in a
decisive 80-0 football game.

 

W&L Leads New CAC In Scoring;

Centre First Conference Foe

Southwestern at Memphis became
the first member of the newly
formed College Athletic Conference
to record a conference football vic-
tory Saturday as the Lynx defeated
Centre College at Memphis, 20-14.

On the basis of performances in
their first three games of the cur-
rent season, the Lynx also assum-
ed dominance of the new league in
most statistical departments.

Other members were active against
non-conference opponents, with Se-
wanee besting Hampden-Sydney, 22-
7, and Washington and Lee losing to
Emory and Henry, 38-33, for the
Generals first loss in 22 games over
a span of four seasons.

Although Washington and Lee

players trail in most statistical
departments, the Generals are |
pace-setters in scoring. Junior |

halfback Henry Sackett has 22 |
points on three touchdowns and
two conversion runs, while team-
mate fullback Tommy Keesee
trails with 16 i on two TD's

and a pair of conversion runs.
Agnew, Hourigan, Hugh Harwood
of Southwestern and Kenneth
Kell of Centre all have 14 points.

Last Saturday’s games featured
the “home run” play by budding
conference stars. Washington and
Lee’s Bill David returned an E&H
punt 94 yards for a touchdown, while
Sackett contributed a 93-yard kick-
off runback for another score.
Sewanee’s Agnew went 84 yards to
score with a Hampden-Sydney punt,
and teammate Jim Stewart raced
56 yards with an intercepted pass.
Bill Harwood of Southwestern con-
tributed a 47-yard run from scrim-
mage for a Lynx TD, and Wash-
ington and Lee’s Stuart Yoffe re-
corded a 36-yard scoring run on a
reverse.

Asst. Sports Editor

The Generals may have been
sharply stung by the Wasps of Em-
ory and Henry last week, but they
will seek to return the favor Sat-
urday against the Yellow Jackets
of Randolph-Macon.

Once again faced with an away
game and a Homecoming situation,
W&L has every reason to want to
revenge for last week’s 33-38 loss
to Earl Hawkins of Emory and
Henry.

The

Generals will be facing a

 

Randolph-Macon team which
been considerably bolstered by strong
freshman additions. This will give
them greater depth and tend to
minimize the depth advantage W&L
has usually had with the three
platoon system

McCaleb Returns

All-state fullback Jack Luck is
the man to watch for the Yellow
Jackets, but the lighter W&L line
is liable to give him a_ surprise
as Bob Payne and company will
have the added services of tackle
Phil McCaleb. The 190-pound senior

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
defeated Virginia Tech, 3-1, on
Smith Field Wednesday.

VPI got off te a quick start and
surprised the Generals by scor-
ing within five minutes of the start
of the game to lead 1-0.

The Generals did not take long to
retaliate, as Co-captain Bob Pagano
shot and scored from thirty yards
out mid-way through the first period
to tie the game.

The Generals dominated play for

the remainder of the contest, dis-
playing hustle and strong team
work,

Penalty Kick

A VPI penalty in the second quar-
ter allowed right wing Steve Hib-
bard to attempt a penalty shot
which he put by the Tech goalie.

Throughout the second half
W&L dominated the ball but the
Generals were unable to score
until, with two minutes left, fresh-

~* man Tim Henry scored from the

inside-right position.

Fullback and Co-captain Tom

played an exceptionally

as he broke up several Tech scoring
threats.

Especially good performances were
turned in by halfbacks Frank Wake-
field and Bruce Jackson. Bob Pagano
and Steve Hibbard were most in-
strumental in carrying the play of
the forward line.

The soccer team’s season record
is 3-1, with ten games remaining
in the season. The team’s next match
is against a perenially strong Lynch-
burg College team.
