Debaters
Take Ist,
2 Awards

By STEVE SMITH
News Editor
Washington and Lee’s de-
bate team won first place and
brought home two _ trophies
from its first tournament of
the year, the Old Dominion

Invitational in Norfolk last week-
end.

Bill Noell and Al Eckes won the
two-man division with a 5 and 1
record, Noell also winning the Per-
suasive Speaking contest. Out of 13
schools entered, including Navy,
Maryland, South Carolina, and
America, W&L was the only team
to earn more than one first place
prize.

Appear on Television

While they were in Norfolk, Noell
and Eckes filmed a TV _ debate
against the tournament host, Old
Dominion College. The question for
the television show was the national
collegiate debate topic: Resolved,
that the non-communist nations of
the world should establish an eco-
nomic community.

The film, which was shown Sun-
day and will be shown again tomor-
row was not judged for a decision,
but viewers of WAVY-TV have
been asked to write to the station
as judges of the debate.

Strength Against Strength

The tournament’s six rounds of
debate were arranged by the
“strength against strength” method,
so that a winning team met only
other winning teams and the los-
ing schools were in turn paired to-
gether. This type of tournament is
most difficult to win, because the
competition becomes progressively
stiffer, until, theoretically, the two
top teams face each other in the
finals.

Noell and Eckes, debating affirm-
ative and negative sides of the ques-
tion alternately, were thrown against
South Carolina in their final round.
Against USC, a perennial debate

 

power which consistently is repre-
sented in the national champion-
ships, W&L piled up enough points
to win by the narrowest margin.

Noell won the speaking contest
with a speech on “Beliefs.” It was
the third time that he has won the
speaking trophy. Eckes placed third)
in After-Dinner Speaking with a
humorous talk on “What the Civil
War Means to a Yankee.”

Discuss Tournament Experience

Last night the entire debate team
met to analyze in discussion the
principle arguments which were en-
countered in the weekend meet.

ing on the committees. Only the
freshman appointment is completely
unprecedented.

Bob Vaughan, Phi Gam from
Petersburgh, Va., is the first fresh-
man to be placed on the Assimilation
Committee or any other university
committee.

Bill Noell

Assimilation Committee Chairman
Bill Noell has long advocated the

Frosh Granted Clemency;
Get To Take Off Beanies

Freshmen are no longer required
to wear beanies, the Assimiliation
Committee announced Saturday.

Assimilation Committee chairman
Bill Noell said today he hopes that
this act, coupled with today’s addi-
tion of a freshman to the commit-
tee, will encourage the freshman
class to adhere to the more vital
traditions of the university.

Meanwhile, concerning actual
shipping which may be moving to-
ward Cuba, the U.S. Navy is watch-
ing a Soviet vessel believed to be
rigged to carry guided missles. But
President Kennedy still has to issue
the formal order putting the quaran-
tine into effect. No American war-
ships are authorized to actually stop
foreign vessels moving toward Cuba,
despite what Kennedy said last night.

U.S. Ships are at sea around Cuba,
but the State Department says that
it is considering giving Cuba and
the Soviet Union a period of grace
before our ships actually begin halt-
ing and searching vessels.

All military leaves have been
cancelled by Russia for her own
officers, and she has warned the
U.S. she will not permit her Cuba-
bound ships to be searched for of-
fensive weapons. Observers in Mos-
cow believe that Russia has taken
a moderate line in its reply, how-
ever, even though some harsh words
have been used in the statements.

These observers were more im-
pressed by what was not in the
Soviet statement than by what was
in it. For example, the Russians have
made no mention of Berlin, nor have
they begun to amass any troops, nor
have they convoyed their supply
ships to Cuba in order to call Ken-
nedy’s hand.

A Word On ‘Mergers’

Openings is over, and all-in-all it must be judged a suc-
cess as dance weekends go. Board President Frank Young and
Set President Tom Supak are to be congratulated on a well-
planned and, with the exception of a couple of unavoidable
complications, well-executed concert and dance.

The fraternities showed unusual energy and originality in
their Homecoming displays, and the football victory put every-
body in a partying mood. Seemingly, the innovations of no
combos during University-sponsored activities detracted little
from the success of the weekend.

One aspect of this year’s Openings, however, we question
as a worthwhile contribution to party weekends; that is the
trend—begun a few years ago and increasing in popularity

with each big weekend—toward
to hire top ranking combos.

The reasoning seems to be that if two houses go together,
they can bring in the best possible dance groups for a reason-
able amount of money, while if they hire combos singly the

fraternities would be paying

quality of entertainment. The growing tendency to go in for
these party partnerships is evidenced by the fact that six houses
in three groups of two had the Del Vikings, the Coasters, and

the Shirelles Saturday night.

As far as we could see, each

less than successful. It is true that the entertainers were ex-
ceptionally good—when they could be heard. Most of the time
it seemed to us the three houses where the parties were held
were bursting with more than capacity crowds; too much smoke
made breathing almost impossible, and too much conversation
drowned out all but occasional spurts of music.

Obviously, “closing” the combos doesn’t do any good, for
all three of the double parties this weekend were supposed to be
closed. And even if it were possible to restrict attendance to
two fraternities, 75 or 80 people with dates are more than can
comfortably be accommodated by any house on campus.

We are not suggesting that inter-fraternity mixing isn’t
good; only that the trend toward big-name combos under two-

house sponsorship is producing

Conservative Society
‘Works for Freedom’

By JIM DeYOUNG

One of the most increasingly sig-
nificant forces on the American col-
lege scene is a move toward po-
litical conservatism.

Back in 1960, Conservatism really
found its impetus on the college
campus with the formation of the
Young Americans for Freedom
(Y.A.F.) at Sharron, Connecticut.
later that

It was only a year

W&sL’s conservative society joined

the fast-growing movement with a
charter membership of fifteen peo-
ple.

Late last spring the Society
switched from Y.A.F., which was
solely a political action group (they
are the power behind conserva-
tism in New York state) to the Inter-
collegiate Society of Individuals
(1S.I.) which is dedicated to the
education of students in the ideals
of conservatism.

Non-Partisan

ILS.1. is a tax-exempt group and
is non-partisan in politics. They can-
not engage in any political action,
but are allowed to express their
opinions on such things as govern-
mentally controlled medicine versus
privately controlled medicine with-
out showing partisanship.

The membership in IS.I. num-
bers 15,000 presently and there are
around 45,000 past college graduates
that were members at one time.

The LS.I. also finances both con-
servative society speakers heard on
our campus and the Southern Con-
servative newspaper. The organiza-
tion sponsors these two things free
of charge because of W&L’s affilia-
tion with the program.

Run on Donations

Where does the I.S.I. get its mon-
ey? Contributions from individuals
and foundations make up the only
source of the LS.I.’s income. Young
men not too many years out of col-
lege head the organizaztion.

The LSI. also runs a summer
school for two weks, free of charge,
for students in schools that are af-
filiated with the organization. Last
summer they used the Southern
Conservative paper as an example
of the “quality and type of publica-
tion” desired by the LS.I. Eventually,
they hope to branch out into a larger
session so as to give college credits
for their courses.

The Society's Purpose

What exactly is the purpose of the
Southern Conservative Society on
our campus?

According to President Wyatt
Durrette, “We came together with
two purposes in mind: 1) education
and 2) dissemination. ...We are

 

against any force of tyranny over

the minds of men and are dedicated |

to the defeat of, not ‘co-existence’
with, international communism.”

Durrette went on to say that the
conservatives were fighting
preserve the freedom in the few
areas where it truly exists, and to
“return the freedom to areas that
have been deprived of it.” the con-
servative society feels that in order
to be free one “has to show re-
sponsibility” and this responsibility
is to be found with the local levels
of government rather than with the
federal government.

To Educate the People
They feel that if they can edu-

to} -

cate people in the conservative ideal, | *

in the principles of economics and
philosophy, and inculcate a strong
moral fiber, the individual man
will be able to stand on his own

two feet and make his own decisions. | .

They believe this is a most import-
ant goal for all mankind, and are
doing their part to further accom-
plishment in this field.

With these goals in mind the So-
ciety had several speakers on the
campus last year.

Among them were Robert Golds-
boro, former investigator for the
House un-American Activities Com-
mittee, and Col. Robert Weaver,
former Chief of the Army Psycho-
logical Warfare School. Two movies,
“Operation Abolition” and “Com-
munist Encirclement—1961” were al-
so shown.

Dr. Russell Kirk

Dr. Russell Kirk spoke earlier this
year on the “Essence of Academic
Freedom.” The Society is trying to
get, later this year, Erik vonKueh-
nelt-Leddihn, a political theorist
from Austria, author of Liberty and
Equality, a study of democracy and
classical liberalism, in addition to an
unfriendly examination of Naziism.

The Socety is also seeking out
Stan Evans, one of the leading fig-
ures in the college age conserva-
tism revival and author of the book
Revolt on the Campus, a study in
the history of conservatism on col-
lege campuses.

Professor Anthony Bouscaren also
may come as a speaker. He is the
author of Soviet Foreign Policy:
Pattern of Persistence.

Both Bouscaren’s and Evan’s books
will be given to the library later
this week by the LS.I. along with
Up From Liberalism by William

| Buckley and Our Nation’s Water Re-

sources—Policies and Politics by
Ben Moreell.

The Southern Conservative So-
ciety feels that they have profited
from a year’s experience and as a
result have already expanded their
activities for this year.

Their goals are set; they are work-
ing hard to attain them.

Homecomings Weekend In Review:

Combo Parties And Missin

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor
Tuesday Edition

Kleenex from homecomings dec-
orations is caught in hedges all over
Lexington, bottles of aspirins have
been emptied, the Delacardos have
gone back to North Carolina, and
Openings Weekend is done once
again.

It was an unusual weekend. Two
of the big attractions were not able
to perform—Clyde McPhatter’s man-
ager didn’t know what had happened
to his charge; the Coasters were so
blasted they couldn’t have led them-
selves out of a burning building.

All in all, however, the weekend
was a great success. The frequency
of party weekends has been cut
down from year to year, and the
difficulty of the academic curricu-
lum has been stepped up.

Days of Deserved Nirvana

The result is an ever-present need
to forget books and take to the bot-
tle and a date for a couple of days
of deserved nirvana. After allowing
this need to build up for three
straight weeks, there was no possible
way for openings Weekend to fail.

The weekend started off with the
judging of Homecomings decora-
tions, and the ZBT’s won it, follow-
ed closely by the Kappa Sig’s, the
Lambda Chi’s, and the Phi Delts, in
that order. The difference in judg-
ing came with those decorations
which were planned for display in
both daylight and at night.

If some sound-effeets had been
furnished, this was a count in that
house’s favor also. A number of
houses were eliminated from the
running due to the fact that some
of the judges were ladies, and sev-

 

eral decorations were, to say the |
least, unfit for a respectable tady's
perusal.

The Beta’s Bird |

The truck drivers were getting al
big kick out of driving by the |
Beta house Friday afternoon. |

The cocktail party was crowded, |
ill-ventilated, and the sound system |
was inadequate. This is typical for |
the basement of the Mayflower. |
More space is available at the}
Moose Lodge, which is available for |
rental, and the band could be seen |
better there. Future cocktail party |
chairmen should learn one thing)
from this last one, though, and that |
is that a reliable loud speaking |
system should be seen to as the
most important factor in any such|
affair.

Then, a few hundred Egyptian fan- |
wavers should be imported to pro-|
vide the necessary ventilation for
the room in a town which has not
yet heard about air conditioning.

McPhatter’s Mistake

Friday night, when it became ob-
vious that Clyde McPhatter had not
been able to find Lexington (indeed,
his band stayed an hour and a half
at the Mary Baldwin gymnasium
thinking it was at W&L), the Little
Boys and the Del Vikings were
thrown into the breach.

The Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities’ decision to cut out com-
bos during University functions hurt
badly on this night, although it is
very probable that nothing like this
will happen again. Once every
few years there is a breach of con-
tract, and in dealing with rock-
and-roll personalities the chances
of a contract break are increased
ten-fold.

 

 

Happy Alumni and a Winning Team

The football team responded ad-
mirably to the slogans which the
fraternities had adopted in their dis-
plays, and on Saturday afternoon
made the alumni happy. The week-
end couldn’t have been better as
far as weather was concerned, and
so everyone was happy and ready
for the concert Saturday night.

It need not be said that King Cur-
tis was great, which he was, or
that the Shirelles were entertain-
ing, which they were.

The fact that they didn’t know

| the words to a couple of their most

famous past hits gave everyone an
indication that they may not have

| scored too high on their college
| boards.

Make-Shift Concert
At any rate, the Delacardos took
over for the Coasters, and did a
good job of it. They had come over
to the gym to watch the show, and

| Fronk Young asked them to do a

15-minute show themselves.

They had ten minutes to run back
out to their station-wagon, pick up
instruments, put on dress-coats, and
get on stage. After a couple of be-
ginning numbers, Chris, their lead
singer, started screaming “Ooh Poo
Pah Doo” and the concert was a
success again.

Big Name Combos

Combo parties after the concert
are history now—most of them prob-
ably lived up to expectations. There
were a lot of big names on campus,
so that anyone coming to W&L from
another school would have wonder-
ed where all the money was coming
from. But fraterinties had teamed
up to pay the rather prohibitive

 

prices, thus cutting down the cost}

g Singers

per individual fraternity to a very
reasonable sum.

One mark of the weekend—quite a
few closed parties—was a change
from the past. Perhaps the old era
of wide-open parties at W&L is
finally dying out. It would be too
bad.

Sunday afternoon there was a
closed party at the Moose Lodge—
closed, that is, to all houses except
the Phi Gam’s, Phi Delt’s, SAE’s,
Delt’s KA’s, Phi Psi’s, and Betas.
It represented the traditional tying
up of the weekend, and it was done
very well.

The Delacardos performed for it,
the standard of behavior could be
described as a sort of bleary-eyed
sophistication, and the party was a
great success.

By this time, cars were leaving
Lexington, taking girls back, and
restaurants were full of students on
their way home from various Vir-
ginia towns after leaving their dates
at respective schools, homes, or bus
stations.

Looking Ahead: Fancy Dress

Frank Young should be highly
congratulated for his weekend, as
should Tom Supak. As for the at-
tractions who didn’t show up, as
Frank said, you can only do so
much. After you’ve signed the con-
tract, gotten the deal cemented, and
made a couple of reassuring phone
calls to the manager right before
the weekend you can only sit back
and count on them to arrive. When
they don’t, there’s really nothing to
be done but take back your de-
posit and look to Fancy Dress.

And that’s precisely what we're
doing now—looking to Fancy Dress.

‘Silent Service’ Is Keynote
Of The UCA’s Activities

By BILL SUPON

Perhaps the most taken-for-
granted organization on the W&L
campus is the University Christian
Association.

The average student would have
a hard time telling exactly what it
is and what it does, apart from the
more obvious things like the annual
Christmas service, and last year’s
campaign to get Martin Luther King
to speak here. Other than these,
very few people could say anything
about the UCA.

Grew Out of YMCA

Actually, this lack of publicity has
been part of the UCA since it began
years ago as part of the YMCA, on
up to the present day. As President
Ashley Wiltshire says, “We're not a
prestige organization like the 13
club—we have united to try to build
a fuller life for ourselves and the
University. Action is what counts.”

This “fuller life” is realized in
two ways: intellectually and in com-
munity service.

In the intellectual line, the group
sponsors a series of seminars in re-
ligion each year, featuring well-
known speakers from around the na-
tion, This year there will be three
such seminars, one with Hobart
Mowry, head of the Department
of Psychology of the University of
Illinois, discussing “Modern Con-
cepts of Man.”

Religion Down the Road

Also related to the intellectual
side of things is the monthly meet-
ing at which a professor speaks on
a topic of interest. These meetings
are usually in seminar form with
free discussion on the matter at
hand.

“In adition, we send a group of
boys to Hollins, Randolph-Macon,

 

and Sweet Briar once a month to
meet with some of their girls—for a
theological discussion, of course,”
says Dr. Hodges, advisor to the
group.

The community service projects
include the Boy’s Club, possibly the
best known of these. Some of the
members go to the local junior high
school and direct about fifty boys in
football and similar activities.

Welfare Workers

The UCA also contributes its part
to Kennedy liberalism by assisting
in passing out government surplus
food to people on relief once a
month.

Allied to this is the Mountain Mis-
sion Program, in which students go
to small country churches in the
area to teach classes and assist in
Sunday services.

What about plans for the future?
“Well, we'd like to send the UCA
president to Union Theological Sem-
inary each summer for their train-
ing program,” says Wiltshire.

As for long-range plans, the UCA
would like to have some form of
services for the student body—“the
chapel is a museum, not a place to
worship. There just isn’t any place
for worship. We want to do some-
thing about it.”

The Purpose of the UCA

The UCA also wants more discus-
sion groups. Too often, classes in
the University only touch on the
ideas involved in religion and theol-
ogy. In Wiltshire’s words, “We would
like for the student to realize that
there are principles underlying
them—important principles which
one must grasp sometime in_ his
life. I guess this is the purpose of
the UCA.”

“Friends of General Walker” have
sent a poster to the Ring-tum Phi

capital letters, “PROTECT YOUR

On the poster is a re-print of an
editorial from the Dallas Morning

stitutional dissolution, and federal
infringement on civil rights.

After an appeal to Americans to
protect their rights, the editorial
ends, and fades into a huge headline
urging “SEND YOUR CHECK OR

And, as an after thought, the pos-
ter adds “Make checks payable to

Generals Chug Past Johns Hopkins For Fourth Win

Blue Jay Mistakes Help
W&L Roll To 22-8 Victory

Washington and Lee, sputtering like a rusty old locomotive,
received a couple of timely nudges from Johns Hopkins and
chugged to a 22-8 homecoming win Saturday.

 

x <. Course

Attraction

The cross-country team thought
the weekend over when it trudged
out to practice Monday. Little did
it know of the events to come. As
the team ran the course backwards
it came upon a remarkable find—a
boy and girl entwined in the middle
of the cross-country path.

Fast runners raced to circle back
for another look. Slow runners went
slower and slower. And Tom Stov-
er, a wrestler getting some early
workout, failed to complete the
course. Coach Dick Miller was very
excited by the report and may run
with the team from now on.

For future information come out
and run with the cross-country
team this week.

If comparative scores mean any-
thing, Washington and Lee better
be well prepared for Sewanee Nov.
10.

The Tigers, who gave the Generals
one of their toughest games last
year, walloped Randolph-Macon
Saturday, 30-8.

Everyone, of course, remembers
that the Generals only squeaked by
the Yellow Jackets, 18-13.

Southwestern also continued its
winning string by boping George-
town, Kentucky, 14-7.

Centre, however, bowed to De-
pauw, 30-6.

Southwestern still leads the Col-
lege Athletic Conference with a 1-0
record, but Sewanee should join
them after meeting Centre this
weekend.

Defense Weak

Hopkins, following the precedent
set by Emory and Henry and Ran-
dolph-Macon, pushed through the
W&L defense at will, but a fumble,
an intercepted pass by Dan Flour-
noy, and W&L’s defensive stand of
the day thwarted the Blue Jays’
three serious scoring threats.

Fullback Tommy Keesee, and half-
backs Stu Yoffe and Skip Chase,

ett, carried the offensive load,
no one matched Keesee’s or Yoffe’s
impressive performance against Ran-
dolph-Macon.

Butler, Norman Return

Red team fullback Syd Butler and
halfback John Norman showed some
of their old zip after returning from
injuries, reeling off 22 and 12 yards
respectively.

The Generals, relying as usual on
their “powerful” ground game, man-
aged only 47 more yards than Hop-
kins, 184 to 137. The total offense
was even closer with W&L leading,
228 to 203.

After failing to move the ball in
its first series, W&L received a
gift-wrapped scoring opportunity
with 12:20 left in the first period.

Blocked Punt

Johns Hopkins’ center, Joe Hahn
hiked the football over punter Neale
Smith’s head into the end zone.
Smith retrieved the ball, but W&L
tackle Jim Sylvester deflected
Smith’s punt and quarterback A. J.
Barranco fell on the loose football at
the Hopkins 14.

Yoffe and Chase carred to the
seven. Keesee plunged to the one-
foot line and hurdled over on the
next play. Chase turned right end
for the two-point conversion.

team, 17-38.

41 mile course in a time of
25:15. Washington and Lee’s top
runner, Mike Shank, challenged
Green for two and a half miles be-
fore developing side pains.

Andy Kilpatrick, a sophomore star
of the harriers, took over the num-
ber one position for Washington and
Lee, but could manage only a fourth
place in the meet against the tough
Old Dominion runners.

Freshman Riff O’Connor and soph-
omore Bob Patton finished second
and third for Washington and Lee
(seventh and eight in the meet)
followed by Scott Kennedy and
Rick Rogers.

The Generals’ cross-country squad
now holds a 3-2 record and will meet
Franklin and Marshall here this
Saturday.

The Diplomats were one of the two
teams which defeated the Generals
