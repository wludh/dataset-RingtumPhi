Ex-Gov. Will Deliver
Tucker Law Lectures

Colgate W. Darden To Speak Here May 4-5

Former Virginia Governor Colgate W. Darden, Jr., will
deliver the 15th annual John Randolph Tucker Lectures in the
School of Law at Washington and Lee University on May 3
and 4.

The one time Virginia chief executive, who has practiced

 

   
  
  

shelters. |
A crew of four men from the|

Norfolk district, Army Corps of

Engineers, under the direction of

Richard Barlow, arrived in town last
week to begin the shelter marking |
program.

The largest concentration of |
marked shelters is on the VMI post.
The shelter areas had been surveyed |
earlier. |

Washington and Lee officials de- |
clined to have the shelter areas in|
W&L buildings marked at this time, |

Mr. Barlow said.
Regarding Washington and Lee’s |
position in the matter President

Fred C. Cole made the following |
statement:

“Washington and Lee has not de-|
clined to make its facilities available
for fallout shelters.

“We have made a complete re- |
view of our facilities at Washing-
ton and Lee and have conducted
a much more comprehensive study
than was made under the auspices
of the Civil Defense. It is our full
intention to make available all
space that is appropriate for fall-
out shelters. Representatives of
the Army Corps of Engineers
came late Monday, without having
communicated with us in = any
way, and told us of areas that had
been designed as appropriate for
fallout shelters.

“The decision was reached con-
cerning fallout shelters without any
reference to the work and study we
have done over a considerable period
of time. We informed tthe represen-
tatives of the Corps of Engineers
that we would be pleased to have a
recommendation from them, and
when we are of the opinion that an
adequate review has been made, we
will be more than happy to cooperate
with appropriate government offi-
cials. Certainly we are eager to serve
this community in as efficient and
adequate manner as possible.”

The Army Engineers team mark-
ing buildings in the western part
of the state explained that before
any public shelter is designated,
permission must be obtained from
the property owner.

The public shelter areas can only
used in event of actual emer-
gency and state law relieves the
property owners of liability for any
injury in connection with their use.

The all-aluminum shelter signs
designate the number of persons
that can be housed. This is deter-
mined on the basis of ten square

be

 

feet per person.

Between W&L And VMI

Last night an informal speaking
contest between the public speaking |
classes of VMI and Washington and |
Lee was held. Slated on the agenda
were two prepared speeches from |
each side and an impromptu contest,
the subject to be chosen at random
just the contest began. Mr.
Joe from VMI began the

of the evening. The concluding
speech was given by Bob Hart,
senior from W&L. He discussed

the subject of medical care for the
aged.

The final part was the impromptu
speaking contest. The subject chos-
en was, “Katanga and the U.N.” J. C.
Reed held forth for VMI, and Ken

evening with an intriguing critique Lane, Phi Delt, and Dean’s List,

on a newly acclaimed book, “Silent represented W&L. The aftermath

Mr. Steve Parel from W&L fol-

lowed with a highly informative talk |
on the present effectiveness of our
fallout shelter program. His prepon-
derance of evidence proved almost |
beyond a doubt that the present}
fallout shelters, advocated by both
Kennedy and Rockefeller, were in|
effect useless and almost as danger- |

ous as a bomb itself

The highlight of the evening came |
with the speech by Mr. E. H
Pelfeir, from VMI. His subject was,
“A Cow a Farmer and the Danger |
Lying Therein,” pointing out the|
hardships a farmer has in milking}
a cow. He drew some lively imagery |
by comparing the cow to a woman, |

May Change
To Two Years

Proposed sweeping changes in the
college Reserve Officer Training
Corps program, almost certain to
draw strong opposition in the new
Congress, could result in reduction
of the present four-year program
at Washington and Lee to a two-
year program.

As reported by Senate sources in
Washington, the legislation to be
sought by Defense Secretary Rob-
ert S. McNamara would call for:

An end to ROTC programs in
high schools; elimination of the
present compulsory ROTC pro-
grams in all land grant colleges;
and reduction of the four-year
ROTC courses in most colleges and
universities to two years.

Such traditional military colleges
as VMI, Virginia Tech, Texas A&M
and The Citadel would be exempted
from the changes, it is understood.
These schools and others have sup-
plied many of the career officers
for the military service for genera-
tions.

Washington and Lee has an
Army ROTC unit that has been in
operation for about a decade. Be-
tween 50 to 55 students receive
commissions each year. In_ the
335-man ROTC unit, there are 109
contract students.

If the reduction from a four-year
program to a two-year plan is op-
tional, it is expected that W&L
would want to retain its four-year
set-up. If the cutback to two years
is mandatory, the program offered
at W&L would probably be pattern-
ed closely after the present schedule
for juniors and seniors.

W&L ROTC department head, Lt.
Col. Jack Burch declined to com-
ment on the matter.

By faculty action the Saturday
schedule of classes (missed on
Lee's Birthday—Founders’ Day,

January 19) will replace Monday
classes on Monday, January 21.

Reynolds Price, whose first

 

 

ment as president of the University
of Virginia, will speak at 8 p.m. Fri-
day (May 3) and 12 noon Saturday
(May 4), according to an announce-
ment by Law School Dean Charles
P. Light. No subject has been listed
for Darden’s lectures.
Public Address

The public addresses will coincide
with Washington and Lee’s alumni
reunion program for the classes of
1913, 1923, 1938, and 1953. Both law
and academic graduates and stu-
dents are expected to attend the
lectures along with non-alumni at-
torneys and students from other in-
stitutions. Members of the Washing-
ton and Lee Law School Assn. also
are expected to be on hand for the
sessions. May 4 will be Washing-
ton and Lee’s official Law Day.

The Tucker Lectures were es-
tablished at Washington and Lee in
1949 as a part of the university's
bicentennial celebration. They
honor the memory of John Ran-
dolph Tucker’s long service as
professor and dean of of the uni-
versity’s School of Law. The late
John W. Davis, an alumnus, na-
tionally-known attorney and the
1924 Democratic candidate for
President, delivered the _ first
Tucker Lectures. Orison S. Mar-
den, president of the Assn. of
the Bar of the City of New York,
was the Tucker lecturer last May.

Judges
Other judges, attorneys and edu-
cators who have participated in the
lecture series are Judge Arthur T.
Vanderbilt, Judge John J. Parker,
John Lord O’Brian, Judge Joseph C.
Hutcheson, Jr., Judge Harold R.
Medina, Dean Robert G. Story, Wil-
liam T. Gossett, Dean F. D. G. Rib-
ble, John J. McCloy, Whitney N.
Seymour, Ross L. Malone and Judge

E. Barrett Grettyman.

A former United States Delegate
to the United Nations, Darden re-
ceived his bachelor of arts degree
from the University of Virginia
and his M.A. and LL.B. degrees
from Columbia University. He also
studied at Oxford University on a
Carnegie Fellowship.

Darden served as president of the
University of Virginia from 1946 to
1959. He also represented Virginia
at the 73rd, 74th, 76th, and 77th

sessions of Congress and served two
terms as a member of the Virginia
General Assembly.

See You At

By BILL KINSEY
Friday Columnist

During the past two months I have
atempted to discuss several aspects
of the field of edu-
cation and to sub-

scrutiny our par-
ticular brand of
education here at
Washington and
_ Lee. Proposals for
reform have been
made both by my-
self and by others.
Some of these
have aroused a
great deal of stu-
dent interest; many have expressed
their agreement and their concern
over the issues involved.

something of a genius, you are not
going to get much done in that free
hour in the morning anyway except
possibly have a cup of coffee in the
Co-op. So why not try it? Take
|a look at the catalog and sample
some of the courses which you think
might interest you. And, it is not a
bad idea to look into some of those
you think could not possibly interest
you. You may get some surprises.

Also I urge the students to read
and write outside of what is as-
signed in class. This gives one the
valuable experience of looking
further into his own interests and
of getting to the root of many mat-
ters on his own, in other words,
the satisfaction of self-motivated
accomplishment.

 

Finally, for the student who is
most dissatisfied and who would go
further than I have here gone, I
would advise this: abstract yourself
from the curriculum. This means
that the student acknowledges that
fact that he is enrolled in a program
which makes certain demands on
him but that he stays as far from
these demands as possible. He ful-
fills all his requirements with a
minimum of effort and time and
thought. He is admitting the inade-
quacy of the established program
for his personal needs and is study-
ing entirely according to his own
plan.

This student will devote himself
fully to the courses which chal-

lenges him and throws up new
ideas for his study, but he will

shun the dull and plodding courses
and avoid the dry, wearisome pro-
fessors. If he should be forced
into such courses, and such men,
he will skim over the work, aiming
only at passing the course and get-
ting it behind him.

But this last step is not a good
one. If any great number of students
adopted this attitude, the result
would be the undermining and de-
struction of all that is good in our
present system. It amounts to a
negative approach to the very con-
cept of a university. Rather what is
needed, once again, is a general air
of student-faculty-administration
cooperation and understanding, a
desire to listen to new ideas, and a
willingness to give them a try if

 

they sound feasible.

These proposals have ranged from |
a modified cut system ‘to a method of |
education based almost entirely on/|

accept the fact that any realization
of these suggested plans will be a
long time in coming, if it comes at
all. So what are we who are here
now to do?

It is this question that I wish

Those of you who are entirely

you to flip to Peanuts. This is for
those men who have a real con-
cern in their educational process
and who do not feel completely
satisfied with what they are getting
here and now.

No, I am not going to advise such
a student to transfer somewhere
else. The grass may be greener from
our point of view, but let me assure
any who doubt it that there are
just as many if not more weeds in

 

other educational pastures. Rather I

Changes In Paramount Inn Symbolize

The Vanishing Herd. Many W&L

a game of pool or
shuffleboard or
just idle conversa-

New Type

It must be admitted that Wash-
ington and Lee is attracting a dif-
ferent type of student than the old
W&L man of recent years. For better
or worse the complexion of the stu-
dent body is undergoing a change.
Talking to a member of the vanish-
ing herd, he, in a fit of nostalgia,
had this to say about the old Para-
mount and what it stood for:
“Breathes there a man with soul
so dead who has not succumbed
to tugging appeal of the Paramount
Inn while returning from classes,
recovering from an exam or retreat-
ing for his date.”

All who have enjoyed the sanc-

graven in our memories long after

than host and hostess; they were
purveyors of inspiration, consola-
tion, and expiation. They have now
departed and left a shell as a
monument to their absence. The

er exists. One man’s opinion? I
wonder.

What's America’s Greatest Problem Today?

“What, in your opinion, is the greatest problem

facing America as a nation today?”

This is the question which Editor Andy Nea asked
me to put to a number of the students and faculty
members here on the Washington and Lee campus. It
it a question of vital importance to all of us, for our
answer or answers to it should help to determine the
future course of our lives.

Our age is one of great social unrest. It is an age of
rapid social mobility, of changing values, of great ten-
sions on ‘the international scene. Old idols, ways of
thinking and patterns of behavior, are passing away;
new ones have not yet been established.

“These changes and the anxiety resulting from
them are indicative of a lack of integration between
the various elements in our society. Americans are
questioning their way of life. We are wondering,
“Is the United States aging, losing its youthful vig-
or, vitality, and imagination?” In beginning his TV
debates with Richard Nixon, our President expressed
the feeling of the nation when he said, “I am not
satisfied,”

It is true; we are not satisfied. Americans today
are reexamining their country—the ideas upon which
it was founded, the structures which hold it together.
We have found strengths and we have found weak-
nesses. It is these latter which form the substance for
this article.

In questioning both faculty members and students
on the topic “America’s greatest problem,” I found
two entirely different approaches. The faculty members,
almost as a whole, suggested that our greatest prob-
lem lay in the confrontation of our nation and our
whole way of life by a nation alien to our in thought
and action. The students, on the other hand, think,
again almost as a body, that our greatest problems
are internal and relate to the individual as the principal
component of a free society.

Dr. Gunn clearly stated the first position. “Our
greatest problem,” he said, “is the preservation of a

free society in the face of the Sino-Soviet threat,”
Actually, this single answer is of a dual nature.
First, we must maintain the functioning integrity of
America as a nation in relation to the totalitarian
threat of communist countries. Secondly, we must
maintain freedom as a way of life within our own
country.

According to Dr. Gunn, America would defeat its
own ends if it were forced to develop an absolutist
government of its own in order to maintain effective
opposition to the absolutist governments which con-
front it. We could conceiveably lose our freedom to
ourselves through the development of bureaucracy, the
rise of a totalitarian regime in America, a powerful
military establishment, or even an economy based
almost exclusively on war-industries.

Stated in another way, this second aspect of the
problem is “the preservation of liberal Western tra-
dition in which every individual has the freedom to
develop his own talents in accordance with his own
tastes and the rights of others.”

Dr. Hayner reinforced the ideas of Dr. Gunn,
but included the relationship of America to other
nations besides those directly threatening us, when
he said that our greatest problem was that of “sur-
vival in the international scene and working out a
satisfactory modus vivendi, a way of living with
Russia, and at the same time presenting a program
that will be attractive to the so-called neutral and
borderline peoples, the underprivileged nations in
the rest of the world.”

This problem of relating ourselves to other nations
by developing and following a consistent foreign policy
is an urgent one, according to Dr. Turner. It is also a
difficult one, for two reasons: first, because America
is relatively new in her status as a world leader; and,
second, because the frequent turnover in the executive
branch of our government often brings changes or
even radical shifts in foreign policy.

Dr. Turner suggested that more American uni-

Equipped with the appropriate sticks
from Pres Brown’s the two teams,
made up predominantly of Southern
non-skaters, waged a pitched battle
for several hours on the ice rink lo-
cated at near-by Natural Bridge

Two Yankee _infiltrators, Billy
David and “Slippery” Edge Jackson,
were said to have dominated play,
but the Southern boys played credit-
ably. The two teams have promised
to themselves to practice as much as
possible and plan a rematch over
Fancy Dress weekend. The enthus-
iastic hard core even looks to a
future challenge to the informal
UVa. hocky team, but this remains
to be seen.

versities should have schools of foreign affairs de-
signed to develop in men of outstanding intelligence
and ability qualities needed in our foreign service.

Of the interviewees, only Dr. Shirey specifically
mentioned communism, which he regards “as a kind
of leviathan” representing “all that is bad and adverse
to us.” He feels that the monster communism has
grown out of all proportion in the minds of Americans
essentially because they are ignorant of it, not realiz-
ing what “its stirring parts look like.” It is essential
that we seek to find out exactly what communism is,
what it represents, what its dimensions are so that we
may come to grips with it rather than just set ourselves
“at loggerheads with a bit of amorphousness.”

The expressions of these four professors put our
greatest problem in terms of international issues.
The students, on the other hand, regard our greatest
problem as an internal one, one concerning the indi-
vidual in our society.

A statement of our problem which represents a
transition between the two points of view made by
Ken Lane. He said that “the most pressing problem in
America is keeping people loyal to democracy to such
an extent that they will be willing to sacrifice for it.”

Here the international problem is an unstated
assumption; the fact that Americans might be called
upon to sacrifice for their country, whether that
sacrifice involve time, effort, income, or life, is re-
garded the “given” in a complicated situation. This
I found talking to several students— that they re-
gard as obvious the grave danger of the Sino-
Soviet threat, and regard as our chief problem the
development of the individual in a way that he, as
a funetioning component of this society, might be
able to cope with this or any other difficulty.

Two freshmen regarded our chief problem as a
breakup of primary personal relations—“indifference
among people.” While such a statement seems to be
rather naive on the surface, I think it indicates a depth

of intuitive understanding of America’s central proeb-
lem, which, according to the professors, is “the main-
tenance of a free society in the face of the Sino-Soviet
threat.

Although a functioning nation has several parts—
laws, customs, social institutions, physical resources,
and population, the greatest of these is the people,
the indivduals who make up the nation, its sine quo

non.

It is only through these individuals that a nation,
any nation, is able to function either within itself or
in relation to other nations. It is necessary that these
individuals be able and willing to function together
in cooperation with each other and their leaders and in
accord with common ends which they consider desir-
able if they are to be at all successful in meeting any
form of major threat from outside their nation.

A nation, like an individual, can suffer from
schizophrenia. A nation divided within itself cannot
stand, but will succumb either to civil war or com-
plete internal disintegration, or will fall prey to
foreign invaders

The importance of the maintenance of human con-
tacts and understanding to the survival of America
as a nation was indicated by one interviewee who
regarded the continuation of the freedom of discussion,
debate, and compromise within our nation as essential
to our well-being.

In summary, it might be said that America’s great-
est problem today is the development of rational,
autonomous individuals who will, when given a com-
plete freedom of choice, determine to unite as a nation
devoted to the maintenance of a way of life which
allowed them to live in freedom, and have the courage
to act with prudence and foresight to remove any ob-
stacle, whether it be internal or external, which pro-
vides a stumbling block to the continuation of that
freedom which has allowed them to become what they
are.

Thaskston—9 pts. Supak—10 pts.

Everybody was a star for the
Generals as they dominated the
contest from start to finish. The
game began with each team bat-
tling for the lead, and at the end
of four minutes the score stood at
8-8. At this point the Generals be-
gan to pull away. Employing a
highly effective press and an
equally effective offense W&L shot
out ahead 26-14.

The the Tigers began to find the
basket. Guard Dave Trickler and
forward Bill Hardin brought H-S to
within eight points with five minutes
left in the half. The Generals im-
mediately keyed on Hardin and
Trickler. Seizing this opportunity,
forward Phil Lotz started to sink a
few of his own and the Tigers came
to within five points of the Generals.
With ten seconds left in the half
Hardin hit and at the end of the
period the Tigers were only a scant
three points behind, the score stand-
ing at 33-30.

In the second half the Generals
once more came to life. Guard Lou
Paterno just couldn’t miss and W&L
stretched their lead to seven points.
With seven minutes gone and the
score at 45-37, the Tigers started
to use a zone defense which slowed

trol of the ball. Within the next two
minutes two H-S boys had to
leave the game; one because he tried
to smash the stands with his head
and the other because he injured
his knee attempting to play leap-
frog with General guard Brett
Thackston. This was all well and
good with the Generals who prompt-
ly increased their lead another three
points.

With two minutes to go and the
Generals ahead 70-53, Coach Mc-
Henry took out Roger Fauber and
Howard Martin who both drew a
tremendous ovation from the crowd
for their great performance. After
this, everything was anti-climatic
and the game ended with the score
standing at 73-62.

The Hampton-Sydney game was
probably the biggest upset that the
Generals have staged in a _ long
time. Possibly the largest single fac-
tor in the General’s win was Howard
Martin’s dominance of the back-
boards. The big, 6-4 center kept the
Generals in good shape with his
rebounding and great defensive play.
Roger Fauber was the game’s high
scorer with 19 points. Lou Paterno
put in his best offensive show of
the y year with 15.

Rifle Team Bows To West Virginia

A tough West Virginia rifle team
defeated the Washington and Lee
marksmen 1419-1362 Wednesday
night in Morgantown.

Sergeant Matthew’s rifle team did
their best but just could not match
the deadly accuracy of the W. Va.
sharpshooters.

After last night’s match the rifle
team’s record now stands at 1-2.
Their lone victory comes from a
close match with Georgetown Uni-

 

versity in a triangle meet. The team
has four meets left and hopes to
improve their record.

THE,

Feulser thes Ouse Again;
But Generals Lose, 64-63

A surprisingly tough Lynchburg
College team defeated Washington |
and Lee’s cagers 64-63 in a tight |
contest last night at Lynchburg.

The Generals jumped to a 20-12)
first half lead and it looked as
if they might increase their win
string to three. With about six
minutes left in the first half Lynch-
burg came alive and overtook the
Generals. For the rest of the game
the points spread never varied more
than two points. The Generals man-
aged to keep a slight lead through-
out the earlier part of the second
half, but with eight minutes to go
in the game the Hornets tied it up.
From this point on the lead shifted
hands many times. With 30 seconds
left, the Generals held a slight 63-62
advantage but Lynchburg College
star Don Merideth sank a twelve-
foot jump shot to give the Hornets a
64-63 lead. W&L then called time
out to see if they could sink that
all-important basket. Unfortunately
the Generals didn’t make it and the
game ended at 64-63 in favor of
Lynchburg.

“Bip” Fauber played his usual ex-
cellent game and was the game’s
high scorer with 23 points. This
broke a two-year jinx that Lynch-
burg teams have had on him. Previ-
ously he wasn’t able to break into
double figures.

W&L’s record now stands at 3-7.
For Coach McHenry this makes 40
losses as opposed to 20 wins.

What seems to be the trouble with
basketball at Washington and Lee?
Certainly the teams have had great
potential. In the past few years they

RING-TUM PHI

 

have had far from a perfect, near

 

decent season.

it is too bad

that this ability can’t be developed |

to any degree. This couldn’t be the
fault of our dear coach, Bob Mc-
Henry. I’ve heard reports that “Bat-
tlin’ Bob” slaves over
formations night and day. In fact
three or four times he has come up
with such elaborate offenses and de-
fenses that his opponents have had
to take as much as ten minutes to
crack them. By sheer guts, determi-
nation and no substitution W&L has
managed to compile four losing sea-

sons in the last four years of his
reign.
Rumor has it that Bob is in for

a promotion—faculty handball coach
perhaps. With his sly grin and pleas-
ant disposition Bob instilled in his
players that great German. tradi-
tion of losing.

Under coach McHenry basketball
at W&L has reached a level of our
highly renowned cut system. The
school is still behind you though,
Bob. All the students admire guts.
After all, it isn’t every coach that
will take out a player after he has
scored four straight baskets.

Two Game Play Rates
Sports Star Nomination

This week’s sport star is Howard
Martin, who was the key factor in
W&L’'s victory over Hampden-Syd-
ney.

Coach McHenry cites Martin’s out-
standing play in the past two games
as a real lift to the Generals’ quin-
tet which, now almost halfway
through the season, is beginning to
find itself.

Before Christmas, in a game with
Randolph-Macon, Martin scored 14
points and hauled in 27 rebounds.
McHenry said that Martin’s re-
bound performance was the best on

Martin is a previous letter winner
and this year started for the first
time. He has so far played most of
every game. His average is 8.5
points and well over 12 rebounds
per game.

“It is hoped,” Croft remarked,
“that we have an adequate supply
of costumes to meet this unusually
heavy and promising demand. The
Dance Board regrets that the cos-
tumes must be sold on a first-come,
first-serve basis, but the policy was
a necessary one in light of the very
limited supply available during this
season.”
