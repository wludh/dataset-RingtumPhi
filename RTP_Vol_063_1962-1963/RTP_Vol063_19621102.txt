A research professor of psy-
chology at the University of
Illinois will be a guest lectur-
er November 13 and 14 at
Washington and Lee Univer-
sity.

Dr. O. Hobart Mowrer will
discuss “‘Concepts of Man in
Contemporary Psychology and
Theology” in two public lec-
tures. Both talks are set for
7:30 in duPont Audi-

torium.

Dr. Mowrer’s appearance on the
Washington and Lee campus marks
the first of three speakers scheduled
to appear at the university this
year under the auspices of the
Seminars in Religion program.

Dr. Mowrer also will speak to|
several religion and_ psychology |
classes during his visit.

A native of Unionville, Mo., Dr.

Mowrer has been at the University
of Illinois since 1948. He also has
taught at Harvard and Yale Uni-
versities and held research fellow-
ships at Northwestern, Princeton and
Yale universities.

In addition to more than 100
articles in research and_profes-
sional journals, Dr. Mowrer is the
author of three books on psychole-

He received his undergraduate de-

uree from the University of Mis-
souri and his Ph.D. degree from
the Johns Hopkins University.

Mowrer is a foremost author-

great majority of W&L students
know very little about their school
Medical Center and even less about
the new Infirmary. Both are located
in the basement of the New Fresh-
man Dormitory and both are open
24 hours a day. A registered nurse
is always on duty there and for
more serious cases a doctor is on
call day and night.

From 8:00 to 11:00 in the morning,
Dr. Feddeman is on hand for sick
call. As a new policy this year,
anyone with a non-critical injury is|
to report to the Medical Center
before going to the hospital; other-
wise they will not be admitted to
the hospital. If no one is in the Medi-
cal Center during the lunch hour, |
students can ring the bell outside

ward with bath, a private isolation

However, there is some misunderstanding as to whether
the Honor System applies only to the Commerce Library. This
is not the case. All departmental libraries as well as Mc-
Cormick Library are included under the Honor System. This
is with respect to “cases involving intentional, wrongful re-
moval of books or any other property from the library.”

We here at Washington and Lee are very fortunate to have
our library operated on the basis of free access. At many insti-
tutions, it is impossible for one to enter the stacks or even
to remove without special permission. Here we attempt to have

the most liberal system possible.

tained with the cooperation and support of the student body.

There may be some that contend that an unauthorized
removal of a book is not a breach of the honor system. It can
be argued that the person did not intend to steal the book and
would eventually return it. However, the removal of the book
may deprive other students of its use. This would be a violation

of one’s personal honor.

In addition, it is fitting that this particular section be in-

cluded under the Honor System

tions of the gym. It would hardly seem fair to have the “bor-
rowing” of a jock strap regarded as a more serious offense
than the unauthorized removal of a book.

We And The Veemies

We are pleased to note the

terday. This full dress inspection was conceived by the student
government of VMI in the interest of promoting better rela-

tions between the two schools.

The parade itself was very impressive and we are sure that
it was well received by Washington and Lee students. However,
we are not sure of its real value. It is enjoyable to watch the

SCC States Position
On Campus Drinking

By TOM RAINS
Friday Columnist

Ours is not a tradition.

There is a common assumption
persistent among the student body
that all or the ma-
jority of student-
operated functions
are based on tra-
dition and the de-
- termination to up-
hold it. And, in
many cases, this
assumption is true,
for some student
activities were
formulated years
in the past, found
to be successful,
and have since operated in the guid-
ing light of their origin, with, of
course, certain modifications which
yield to the contemporary demand.
However, there being no criticism
here of this traditional operation, it
is nevertheless necessary to dis-
tinguish between this type of or-
ganization which functions in the
manner mentioned above and one
which is the result of the demands
of the student body.

In its present state, which con-
forms with a national and interna-
tional student, the student body of
Washington and Lee is producing a
constant demand to have more re-
sponsibility and leadership placed
in their own hands. Last year the
Administration took a very large
step in this direction by placing
the handling of disciplinary cases
arising from the various actions of
students in the hands of the stu-
dents themselves. Thus was the for-
mation of the Student Control Com-
mittee. There can be no question as
to the manner in which it was
formed, for it was a step taken by
the Administrative Committee, but
only in conjunction with the stu-
dent government, the Executive
Committee, and with, again, the de-
mands of the students. The primary
intent was not to produce another
tradition to tell incoming students
and their parents about, thus pub-

Rains

 

licizing the age and integrity of this
institution, and thus to have some-
thing to tell succeeding gener-

ations about. Rather, the intent was | Hag

to spread the area of self-govern-
ment among students and to place
the responsibility of “student con-
trol” on the students themselves.
This does not eliminate the possi-
bility of the Student Control Com-
mittee becoming a tradition, but
again, this was not the primary
attempt, nor is it the matter at hand.

Public Drinking

To turn now to the most recent
issue in which the Control Commit-
tee was involved, that of dealing
with drinking on the upper field at
home football games, it seems to
be necessary to offer some kind of
clarification for the actions of the
Committee. This assumption is based
on comments made on this action,
both pro and con, and both spoken
and written. There was, and prob-
ably still is in some instances, a com-
mon misunderstanding of the rule
concerning drinking on school prop-
erty, particularly in the area of
the intramural field, the parking
area for football games, the “upper
field,’ Alumni Field, or whatever
else this place may be called. Some
feel that sufficient notice was not
given about the reinforcement of
this many-year-old rule, and others
think that no notice was given at
all about this, or, at least, they did
not see it. But to give a simple and
brief answer to this problem of
“lack of notice,” there was a notice
placed in the Ring-tum Phi on the
front page indicating that drinking
on this field at football games was
a violation of the school rule. (The
rule states that there is to be no
consumption of alcoholic beverages
on school property.) Also, during the
same week two notices appeared on
the ODK bulletin board stating that
two students had been placed on
Social Probation for drinking on
school property. And, without doubt
the average intelligence of the
Washington and Lee student body

Art Exhibit Displays
Old Japanese Prints

The present art exhibit is now
in its final week at duPont Hall.
On loan from the Virginia Museum
of Fine Arts, it is an example of
Eighteenth Century Japanese block
printing by Hiroshige. This exhibit
is part of the Art Department’s
program of presenting new and
varying shows each month.

Hiroshige was one of the two
greatest artists of his period. In
contrast with his equally well-
known contemporary, Hokusai, who
centered his works around the vast-
ness of nature, Hiroshige empha-
sized personal scenes from nature.

All of his works were done in
series. This exhibit was done along
the Tokaido Road, which runs the
345 miles from Tokyo to the ancient
capital of Mikada. The scenes for
his prints were taken from the 53
halting places along the way.

This type of print required the

 

talents of an artist, engraver, and
printer. A design drawn on paper
was pasted face down on a block
of wood. Then the engraver would
scrape away the paper until the
design showed through. He then
carved the wood so that the lines
were in relief. A different block was
necessary for every color tone.

Next the blocks were carefully
inked. If this was done incorrectly
the shade of color on the print would
be inferior. At the exhibit there are
displays of the same block well done
and poorly done.

Accompanying the display are sev-
veral photographs taken this sum-
mer along this road which demon-
strate the timelessness of these pic-
tures. It is also shown how Hiro-
shige’s work influenced the works of
Monet, Van Gogh, Whistler, and
Gauguin.

 

 

SYMPOSIA...

 

 

 

 

Handlin Asks ‘Are Colleges Killing Education ?’

This week the Ring-tum Phi in- |
troduces a new series. This series,
to be known as SYMPOSIA...,
concerns itself with the broad field
of education. We hope to present
views and concerns both of those
buying this commodity of edu-
cation and of those dispensing it.

While we do not wave any fire-
brands, we feel that education and
our particular brand of education
here at Washington and Lee de-
serves scrutiny from a new point
of view. What is needed is a fresh
and revitalized outlook toward
those revered institutions which
have come down to us through the
years. We shall undoubtedly pre-
sent criticisms positive and nega-
tive, and it is our hope that both
will be heard equally. If one will
only look at such publications as
The Atlantic, Harpers, and Satur-
day Review, he will see that the
same questioning and re-evalua-
tion is going on throughout the en-
tire American educational system.
It is our hope to do a thorough
and comprehensive job of  re-
evaluating at our own local level.

SYMPOSIA is honored to begin
its series by reprinting an article
by Osear Handlin which appeared
in the May, 1962 issue of The Atlant-
ic. Mr. Handlin is presently located
in the Center for Study of the His-
tory of Liberty in America at Har-
vard. He is the author of several
books, among which is The Uproot-
ed, a study of the immigrant in
America, which won him the Pulit-
zer Prize in 1952. He is also a fre-
quent contributor to scholarly and
general periodicals, particularly in
the field of education.
SYMPOSIA..., is edited, organ-
ized, and written by Bill Kinsey.
All contributions and suggestions are
welcome, and all letters will be
published.

With the coming of spring, hys-

teria creeps across the campus.
Tension mounts steadily, and even
when it does not erupt in some
overt form, it still disturbs the last
two months of the college year.
Now is the time when the steadily

 

growing psychiatric staffs come into
their own. |

The young people who brood in|
their rooms, who forget to come}
down to the dining hall, and who |
burst out in fits of irrationality are
not worrying about who will win the
great game or who will come to the
dance or be tapped for the frater-
nity. Joe College is dead, and his
little anxieties are unrecognizably
antique. His successors are immersed
in their books and laboratories, and
their concern is for the grade that
an incomprehensible marking system
will grind out for them.

Among the undergraduates, it is
worst for the juniors. Most of the
seniors are reconciled; they have by
now amassed whatever capital they
will possess and know it is too late
to make serious changes. The sopho-
mores are frenetically hopeful; de-
spite the facts of the past, they
feel that they have a chance. The
freshmen are still reeling from the
shock of self-discovery but are not
yet fully aware of what has hit
them. The juniors are, and therefore
the panic that all share to some ex-
tent is particularly intense among
them.

The phenomenon is_relaiively
recent, and it is not everywhere
the same. Indeed, there may still
be some refuge which is entirely
unaffected, where college remains
a place of learning, not a race-
track. But year by year the infec-
tion spreads, and it seems most
virulent in the best institutions
and among the best students.

The American college functions
with a time-encrusted mechanism,
much of it immensely valuable be-
cause of the experience, tradition,
and wisdom built into it. But some
of its devices were designed for
purposes long since forgotten. We
do not question their presence;
the grating noise they make seems

|a necessary part of the operation.

Who can imagine that this is the
sound of minds being crushed in a
process that frustrates the whole
educational enterprise?

Those great big beautiful A’s so
avidly sought, those little, miserly
C’s so often found, were meant
for another time and another stu-
dent body. They were the tools of
a teacher in the day when the col-
lege was more a disciplinary than

 

an educational institution. The mis-
cellaneous lots of boys and young
men who recited their lessons in
the eighteenth- and _nineteenth-
century American college were in-
differently prepared, only occasion-
ally interested, and given to out-
bursts that took them altogether out
of control. The instructor needed
grades and fines and other punish-
ments to keep them in hand.

The problems of discipline became
less pressing when the college ac-
quired its modern institutionalized
form. The grading system neverthe-
less retained its importance. The
curriculum was divided into blocks
of courses, each worth a number
of points, and an education was de-
fined by the score that stood to the
student’s credit in the college ac-
counting system. The grade then
became critical, because it was evi-
dence of the amount of learning de-
posited to his credit.

The pattern has persisted, al-
though a few remember what
forces brought it into being. Yet
no faculty would now maintain
that education can be defined by
a balance sheet of credits, or that
the statistical magic that produces
grade scores carried to the second
decimal place is a reliable way of
evaluating students.

Until recently the system was
hardly effective enough to do much
harm. A large percentage of the
student body could afford to dis-
regard it entirely. After the man-|
ner of the lads in Owen Wister’s |
Philosophy 4, they looked down on)
the grinds and occupied themselves |
in their own ways. And the minority |
who were interested could study |
away to their hearts’ content without |
the anxiety of involvement in a mass |
competition. |

All has now changed. The new)
students enter after a rigid selec-
tive process, they present few dis-
ciplinary problems, and they arrive’
after good and uniform preparation. |
The constant surveillance of their
studies serves no useful function!
and only interferes with their edu-
cation.

The trouble is that the students |
themselves do not know it. The gen-
eration has been so thoroughly har- |
nessed to the treadmill of the ex-|
amination that it accepts its servi-j|

 

tude as a normal if strenuous con-
dition of life. All the external pres-
sures of society encourage that be-
lief. Since education has become a
national emergency, it is a patriotic
duty to do well in algebra. The
student who gets an A in physics
will not only advance to a success-
ful career but will also defend his
country against the Russians. The
talented boy has replaced the ath-
lete as the school hero, and the
letter worth getting is no longer
that on the sweater but that on the
report card.

The process of subversion be-
gins almost in the first years of
the best high schools. The most
highly motivated students know
that they are engaged in a close
race; only the fleetest will enter
the desirable colleges. Ahead of
them loom the great goals, the
College Boards and the National
Merit competition. Along the way
are the lesser hurdles they must
surmouna, and their task is to
train themselves to score well.

How can their high school educa-
tion have any other meaning? Ad-
mission to college comes generally
in the spring of their senior year
and is based on performances on
tests taken a good deal earlier.
Everything that comes later is total-

ly irrelevant. Furthermore, a variety | the snap courses “which get you

of schemes for early admission and |

early appraisal have pushed some

|of the tests back to the middle of

the third year of high school. For
many students, therefore, almost
half of their secondary school career
becomes meaningless, since it does
not prepare them for the examina-
tions. It is a rare teacher who can
resist the tendency to turn his
classes into extended cram sessions.

Alas, the young people finally dis-
cover that entry into college solves
no problems. It only reveals the new

| hurdles they could not earlier see. |

True, the place is strange and the
conditions of life new, but the race
is the same, only the pace is faster.
Back in those innocent high school

i days, these boys and girls were a

select group—the brightest and best.
Now they are thrown into a mass in
which everyone is select and every-
one had been brightest and best. In
this renewed competition some who
had always been winners discovered |

 

that they too will have to be losers
The cruelty of the contest is clear-
est in courses which establish grades
on the basis of a statistical distri-
bution curve. No matter how hard
they work, or how able they are,
one half of the class will fall be-
low the average. Each _ student,
therefore, finds himself involved in
a struggle with his neighbor, whose
success will drag him down.

Any freshman can grasp the
point of the explanation for his D
on the question in Philosophy H.
“No, there was nothing particular-
ly wrong with the answer. But
everyone else in the section did so
well that the classifying apparatus
sorted you out toward the lowest
of the pigeonholes.” He will learn
thereafter to crowd his way to the
top.

Meanwhile, the goal of college is
the same as that of high school—
the high score will open the way to
the next stage of competition. Now
the students work for the grades
that will admit them to the graduate
or professional school. The intense
haste with which they reach toward
what they mistakenly believe to be
narrowing opportunities shortens
their vision. Tactics become pre-
eminently important. These young
people work hard, and they shun

nowhere.” But they tiptoe gingerly
through the curriculum, weighing
all the angles. One will regularly
carry an additional course all year,
then at the last possible moment
drop that in which the risk is the
greatest. Another sacrifices each
summer vacation, not to shorten his
studies, but because instructors are
reputed to grow more pliable as
the temperature rises. And only the
reckless will dare not to know the
right answers as the grader expects
them, or allow questions to draw
their thinking in unexpected direc-
tions.

Many students now feel unbear-
able pressure from their parents.
The strain is not consciously ap-
plied, but it is none the less real.
It is the product of a situation
that leads young people to wonder
whether their careers in college
will jeopardize the love and af-
fection of their parents.

 

Each family has hopefully groomed
its own aspirants for the race. Mom
and Dad have often made genuine
sacrifice of time and energy to be
sure their hopeful was adequately
prepared. They must not be disap-
pointed. The boy who does well ad-
vances to scholarships and jobs that
will immediately have an effect upon
the income of the whole family. The
one who does not becomes a drag,
reducing his father’s chances for a
new car, his little sister’s prospects
for an expensive education,

The solicitous letters and regu-
lar telephone calls impress upon the
student that fact that it is not he
alone who is being tested, but the
whole family. How proud they are
when the stock rises, how concerned
when it falls! The A shows the
virtue of the home and the school
that produced the good performer.
The C is not only a blow to the ego
of the recipient; it is a reflection
upon the adequacy of his training.
Unless they rebel entirely, the young
people carry to class the anxiety,
lest they let down those who had
invested in them. So much hangs
on the outcome.

The proliferation of rewards has,
paradoxically, stimulated this de-
structive competition. The National
Science Foundation and the Wood-
row Wilson fellowships have done
immense good. But, at the same time,
they have put undesirable pressure
on the aspirants. Those who make
it are free (they think); they see
themselves firmly planted on the
academic escalator with a regular
income, security, and marriage just
within reach. The attractiveness of
these immediate goals obscures every
other consideration.

It is vain to point out that success
in tests is not necessarily the way
to achievement, that careers of great
men do not always begin with a
ranking in the upper tenth percen-
tile, that places are available, and
that there are other than competi-
tive values to education. Their whole
experience points in the other di-
rection,

o ££ 8

The losses to the students and to
society are tremendous. The dis-
torted emphasis nullifies much of
what the colleges aim to do.

Team Back To Strength;
Seek Sixth Season Victory

Washington and Lee starts it bid
for the football championship of the
College Athletic Conference Satur-
day when the Generals meet Centre
College at Danville, Ky.

Assured of a winning season with
a 5-1 record to date, the Generals
close out their 1962 campaign in
three games with conference opposi-
tion. After Center, W&L is host to
Sewanee the following weekend, and
then travels to Memphis for the sea-
son finale with Southwestern.

Centre’s Colonels, a team the
Generals defeated last year by a
53-0 score, are winless to date
(0-4-1), but according to their
scores and W&L scouts, they are
a much stronger squad than in
1961.

“They've made some backfield
switches that have improved their
offense,” says W&L Coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin. “And they’ve got Ron
Kimberlin in the line, as fine a guard
as we've seen this year.”

Centre’s backfield changes invol-
ved position rotation for quarter-
back Bob Hourigan, a halfback in
1961, and halfback Del Hatfield, the
Colonels’ field general last year.

The Colonels are not contenders
for the new conference’s first trophy,
but Seout Buck Leslie rates them
as potential spoilers. In last Satur-
day’s game with Sewanee, the Col-
onels were down only 14-6 in the
fourth quarter before the Tigers
managed a two touchdown outburst
that produced a 28-6 victory. Earlier
in the year, Centre lost to South-
western in league play.

McLaughlin expects Centre to
operate from its true T-formation,
although he remembers last year
when the Colonels threw a shotgun
spread at the Generals. McLaughlin
also expects his team to encounter
a favorite Centre defensive maneuv-
er, the 11-man line.

McLaughlin’s biggest worry is
not what Centre may throw at the

Generals, but the long bus ride to
Danville. W&L is not due to arrive
in Danville until around midnight
Friday. Last season, a late-night
bus ride to St. Louis, after air
flights were grounded, nearly re-
sulted in an upset loss to Washing-
ton University, so the W&L Coach
is wary of this week’s travel ar-
rangements,

Regarding the surprising ease
(55-14) with which W&L bested
Franklin and Marshall last Saturday,
McLaughlin thinks perhaps the
Diplomats played below par, while
the Generals, particularly the third
and fourth units, were operating at
premium efficiency.

“IT was real pleased to see our
Red (second) team move well, for
I knew those boys were capable, but

it was something of a bonus to get
sharp performances from our Gold
and White teams,” the Generals’
coach said.

The Generals may be in the best
shape physically against Centre
than they’ve been in weeks. Oft-
injured Red unit tackle Phil Mc-
Caleb returned to duty against
F&M and according to McLaugh-
lin, “ate their halfbacks alive.”
McCaleb also cashed in on_ his
specialty, a blocked punt.

W&L also may have a healthy
and fit Henry Sackett Saturday.

(Continued on page 4)

Yoffe Named

 

Stu Yoffe’s 14 points and 13.2
yards per carry average in last

Saturday’s 55-14 slaughter of Frank-
lin and Marshall have earned him
the Sports Star nomination this
week.

The 190-pound junior right half-
back reeled off 79 yards in six car-
ries, scoring two
touchdowns and
accounting for one
conversion.

Early in the first
quarter it was his
40 - yard run
through the Dip-
lomat secondary
that set up his
on-foot plunge in-
to the end zone
and the first W&L
score.

Good fakes and added help from
the powerful General forward wall
enabled Yoffe to play, as coach Lee

 

Yoffe

McLaughlin termed it, “the best
game he’s had.”
Yoffe has now taken over the

number two scoring spot in the state,
edging out W&L’s own Tommy Kee-
see. He is now only 12 points be-
hind the state’s leading scorer, Earl
Hawkins of Emory and Henry. Haw-
kins leads the list with 50 points

Colonels 0-2 |
In CAC Play

The College Athletic Conference |
has its busiest Saturday of the 1962 |
football season this week as the four
teams competing for the new league’s
first championship meet in games
at Sewanee, Tenn., and Danville,
Ky.

Sewanee and Southwestern, both |
with conference wins over Centre |
College, meet at Sewanee in a con-
test matching the league’s best of-
fense against its best defense. Coach
Shirley Major’s Tigers have rolled
up 299 yards per game in compiling
a 3-1-1 record to date, while the
Lynx have limited their opposition
to 169 yards a game for a 4-2 slate.

Washington and Lee, 5-1, makes
its first bid for the ‘the against
Centre in a homecoming game for
the wineless Colonels, now 0-4-1.
The Generals boast the confer-
ence’s best rushing attack, 245.7
yards per game, and its best scor-
ing punch, 28.5 points per game.
Centre’s strongest suit is its pass
defense, a league-leading 38.8
a game,

flexed its conference
muscles last Saturday, defeating
Centre, 28-6, in a game tht was
close until the final quarter. South-
western moved past Maryville, 7-0,
and Washington and Lee rolled over
Franklin & Marshall, 55-14.
Sewanee’s great tailback, M. L.
Agnew stretched his total offense |
lead in the conference with a 136-|
yard rushing performance against |
the Colonels. Agnew now has gained |
390 yards on the ground and 320)
in the air for a total offense mark |

of 710 yards.

Sewanee

 

Agnew’s closest challenge is
W&L fullback Tommy Keesee’s |
391 yards, while Centre quarter-
back Buck Hourigan is right be- |
hind with 389 yards. Agnew’s
rushing and passing totals also are
the best in the conference.
Southwestern’s Bill Harwood is |

the top receiver with 14 catches for
125 yards. Hourigan is the top punt- |
er with a 33.4 yard average on 23 |
kicks.

Among conference scoring leaders,

Washington and Lee has three of
the top four. The Generals’ Stu Yof-
fe, a junior right halfback, is the
pace-setter with 38 points on six
touchdowns and a conversion run.
Keesee is second with 32 points,
Agnew is third with 26, and W&L’s
left half, junior Henry Sackett, has
24,

No team in the conference boasts
a strong passing attack, although
Washington and Lee claims an ef-

 

with Yoffe trailing at ; 38.

North Carolina Falls To Bootmen 6-0;
Sixth Win In Sight Against Roanoke

By LOUIS MONGEAU

Sports Editor
After their 6-0 defeat of North |
Carolina State Tuesday, coach Joe
Lyles feels that his varsity soccer
| team is ready for Roanoke College. |
The team will be seeking its sixth |

| victory as it meets Roanoke in that |

school’s Homecoming game Satur- |

| day.

Coach Lyles said that the tie |

| with American University last week
| shook the team. However, the swift |
| comeback against N. C. State showed |

that the booters are back in win-

Line Improves

The line, Lyles continued, is im-
proving with every practice. This
was demonstrated Tuesday, as the
forwards scored all of W&L’s six
goals. The backfield, however, dues
not inspire much confidence. It has
been plagued with many miskicks

 

   
     

and somewhat unsteady play. Lyles

He hopes the fanfare of the bands

the frosh from doing their best.

Another drawback the Generals
