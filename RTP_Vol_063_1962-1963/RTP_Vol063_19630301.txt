Westfel Group Initiates Two Series of Programs

The Westminster Fellowship of the Lexington Presbyterian Church has
initiated two series of programs recently. The first is a series of Frontier
Forums; the first, “You and the University” is being lead by Jere Cravens
and Dean E. C. Atwood, the second, “Word, World, and Sacrament” being
led by Jim Campbell and Rev. Warren Strickler, and the third, “The
Student in the Economic Order,” being lead by Pete Weaver and Mr. John
Gunn.

The second of these programs is one centered on Contemporary Chris-
tian Thought, featuring noted speakers on the Fundamentalist Movement,
and on the thoughts of Rheinhold Niebuhr, Paul Tillich and Dietrich Bon-
hoeffer. These two program series will be held in March and April.

 

Law Students Pass Bar Exam

It was found recently that 61.6 per cent of those W&L students who
elected to take the Bar Exam last December received passing marks.
Those passing the Exam were Oliver Baugess, Malcolm Burton, Jim Howe,
Gerald Kesten, Jim Randolph, Leonard Sargeant, John Tate, Jay Wilks,
and Andy Russell.

Those law students who failed the exam or who did not take it will
take the June exam.

Jarrard’s Article In Psychological Journal

An article by Dr. Leonard E. Jarrard, assistant professor of psychology
at Washington and Lee University, appears in the current issue of the
Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology.

Entitled “Effects of X-irradiation on Operant Behavior in the Rat,” the
article is based on research conducted in Washington and Lee’s psychology
laboratory under the auspices of a grant from the National Institutes of
Health. Dr. Jarrard was aided in his research by three students working
through the University’s Robert E. Lee Research Program for under-
graduates.

International Relations Club Meets Thursday

The International Relations Club will meet Thursday night at 7:15
in duPont Auditorium with Dr. Milton Colvin, Mr. John Gunn, and Col.
B. M. Gilliam of the VMI faculty. This panel will lead a discussion session
after listening to a tape recording by Walter Millis and John Cogley, “The
Warless World.” The tape was made at the Center for the Study of Demo-
cratic Institutions at Santa Barbara, California.

W&L Receives $1500 Grant From Texaco

Washington and Lee has received $1,500 from the Texaco, Inc., aid-to-
education program for the support of privately-endowed colleges and
universities. This marks the seventh consecutive year in which W&L has
participated in the program. The university is one of 150 schools receiving
this amount from Texaco.

Three additional concerts have
been lined up for the W&L glee
club on its Atlanta tour. The 52-
man organization, directed by Mr.
Robert Stewart, begins the tour
Thursday night and is scheduled to
give at least 4 and possibly 5 con-
certs before returning Sunday.

For at least one performance the
glee club can be assured a “cap-
tive’ audience. A concert has ben
arranged for Saturday evening in the
Atlanta Federal penitentiary. Seek-
ing to insure the audience remains
captive, the warden admonished glee
club president Sam Channel by
phone to caution the glee club mem-
bers not to bring in files, machine
guns or narcotics.

Also on the agenda for Saturday
afternoon and early evening are con-
certs at the veterans’ hospital and
Egleston Children’s Hospital. There is
a possibility of another performance,
but nothing definite has yet been
arranged.

The highlight of the trip is the
Friday night concert to be given
along with the Agnes Scott glee
club. The concert will follow supper
in the Agness Scott cafeteria at
which all club members will have
dates.

A major part of the Friday night
concert will be the performance of
Antonia Vivaldi’s Gloria mass for
mixed chorus. The mass takes ap-

part of the program will be baritone
John Baker, bass Phil Booth and
tenor Christian Clark. Frank Wake-
field will accompany the folk selec-
tions on guitar.

Another segment of the program

a very effective speaker, dignified

“As far as this type of speech is
concerned, he is probably one of
the capable and_ effective
speakers on philosophy,” Dr. Hayner
stated.

Blanshard’s speech will involve
suggesting a in which
recent philosophical movements,
identified as linguistic analysis are
effective in dealing with theory of

His thesis is that the search for

thought and art. He thinks that re-

A Timely Tribute

It is one of the unusual characteristics of Washington and
Lee that a student can give a great deal to the University while
getting his education. The new student body service award
should give needed emphasis to this fact and draw attention to
those students who are of service to their fellows and to future
students. Each time it is given it will honor not only a student
recipient, but at the same time a man the value of whose service
to this university cannot be expressed.

It wasn’t really necessary to name a scholarship after Dean
Frank J. Gilliam to ensure that his name will be remembered.
He is remembered by generations of Washington and Lee
students who will never learn about the Gilliam Award; and
his work will be felt at Washington and Lee by generations who
won’t fully know precisely why the award was given in his
name. But certainly no other name could be given this award
with the same fine meaning as that which Dean Gilliam’s gives
it. It is the custom to wait until a man has retired to give him
his due recognition; this time, the student body has been able
to give some small measure of honor to a man still at his desk
every day. No better choice could have been made.

Student Initiative For Programs

The inauguration at Randolph-Macon Woman’s College
of a student-initiated symposium on contemporary problems
allows Washington and Lee’s failure in this field to become
more noticeable. Randolph-Macon’s FOCUS has lined up an
impressive and interesting schedule of speakers and promises
to go a long way toward its goal: to “‘stimulate in the student a
greater concern and better understanding of current issues by
providing an opportunity for active participation and evalua-
tion.”” FOCUS has invited students from other schools, so
that the event will annually be an ‘Eastern and Southern”
affair, not a local one. While W&L has fine programs in its
International Relations Week, Glasgow and Religious speakers,
and others, a peak of stimulation is far away; these already
established are not enough, and must not be used as excuses to
stifle ideas for additional programs.

It is up to the student body, not the faculty, to take the
initiative in any new endeavor, as the girls down the road have
done. A suggestion: next year’s Mock Convention would be
an excellent time to launch a forum of student participation.
The Mock Convention has the prestige to attract prominent
speakers, and it arouses the interest to obtain tremendous stu-
dent cooperation. And it could be greatly improved by adding
to the political rallies, conventioning, and beerfests, such a
student forum as Randolph-Macon will open next weekend.

If anything at all is to be added to Washington and Lee’s
agenda for next year, it must be begun now. Speakers for next
year must be invited this spring; next year will be too late to

get the best.

A Poor First Impression

Every freshman who pledges a Red Square fraternity learns
immediately that it is bad luck to walk under the center arch
of one of the Memorial Gates at the foot of “the Hill.” One
does so only at risk of flunking his next quiz. Somewhere in
the now dim origin of this tradition it must have some connec-
tion with the fact that one of the gates looks so close to falling
over that it could be bad luck to walk under it at any point.
The brickwork is cracked and uneven. The columns lean and
cant in varying directions. Unfortunately, the memorial arches
are the first thing seen by many, perhaps most, visitors to the
campus. Because of their position on the highway and at the
Lee Chapel parking lot, they annually record a first impression
of Washington and Lee for thousands of people.

The gates were erected in 1920 to the memory of Washing-
ton and Lee men who died in the First World War. According
to Mr. D. E. Brady, Supervisor of Buildings and Grounds, the
arches have leaned since they were built. Apparently they set-
tled in their foundations at almost as much of an angle as they
now have. However, for some decades ivy was allowed to cover
everything, and it was forgotten. Finally the ivy was stripped
away about 1950 to reveal the deplorable reality. Later a pic-
ture of the arches appeared in the Ring-tum Phi under which it
was stated that “Wire and a little luck are all that holds them
up.” Mr. Brady denies that the situation is so desperate; but the
fact remains that it does look exactly that bad.

Of course there is a certain romance surrounding the Lean-
ing Tower of Pisa. But then there is London Bridge, too. The

university ought to repair the gateway—now.

Oh horrors of horrors! What the
unfortunate W&L student has rec-
ently endured! He has been forced
to live with a group of long-haired
rowdys wearing blue-jeans, tennis
shoes, dark shirts and ski jackets.

And think of poor Stevie Stud
who had always been taught that all
college men wore Brooks Brothers
garters to hold up their button-down
socks, but has now found out that
some students don’t want to look
exactly like every other student and
have gone to Roger’s Peate for
their garters.

Imagine the shock too when he
discovered that the Gestapo Commit-
tee, organized by Brooks Brothers to
prevent such action as described
above, has been lax in its job and
has not executed these rebellious
misfits. The sad truth has really
hurt Steve, who, until the present
had always been sheltered from so-
ciety’s evils, but now not only does
he see these awful people, but he is
forced to say “hi” to them or be
subject himself to the penalties of the
committee.

There is only one solution to
Steve’s problem—transfer to VMI.

DICK HERMAN
Bs * a
Sir:

In reply to Dick Herman's letter
published today I have some com-
ments. To me, any student who can-
not find worth in W&L’s traditions
does not belong at this school. The
traditions of this school are so in-
tegral a part of the name and char-
acter of W&L that you cannot sep-
arate them. A student who does not
feel that he can respect and continue
the traditions of Washington and Lee
would do himself a great favor by
leaving. In so doing, he would spare
those who cherish W&L’s traditions
his intentional flouting of those same
traditions.

There is a feeling among some stu-
dents that one should laugh off the
fact that some of W&L’s longest-
standing traditions are going by the
boards. This is displayed very well
in Mr. Herman’s letter. I do not
think this a laughing matter. Gne
does not have to come from any par-
ticular part of the country to see
the value inherent in our traditions
at this school; with any thought at

character of W&L depends on the
preservation of these traditions.

I do not blame anyone if thev
find themselves unable to accept our
tradition-oriented campus, but rather
invite them to admit their mistake
in coming here and go elsewhere. I
do think, however, that those who
like W&L enough to make it their
alma mater should at least endeavor
to support those customs which have
made this school what it is.

Dear Sirs:

By BILL LOWRY

Certainly one of the greatest
problems facing us here at Wash-
ington and Lee is what has been
termed “Provincialism.” By this I
mean that there is a tendency to
avoid going beyond the confines of
the campus in further intellectual
pursuit, particularly in our dealings
with students from other univer-
sities. Because of this, our view of
things is all too often very one-
sided, a natural occurrence when
our dialogue with other scho2ls is
so limited.

Assembly in Washington

An example of the possibilities to
which I refer can be seen in the
recent Model General Assembly held
in Washington two weeks ago, und
to which five Washington and Lee
students were sent as delegates. Yet,
despite the fine showing made by
these students, no coverage was
provided in the Washington and Lee
press, and the students had to pay
their own expenses for travel, room
and board (the University paying
only the registration fee for the dele-

 

gation), in addition to being given
no cuts from class attendance at
Washington and Lee. In contrast, one
only has to look at the experience of
the various athletic teams on campus
who have all of their expenses taken
care of, and who are given cuts for
participation as official representa-
tives of Washington and Lee. Cer-
tainly if such can be done for ath-
letic activities, the same could be
provided for the more intellectual
pursuits as well; both types of ac-
tivity have their place in a uni-
versity, and should be encouraged
by the university as much as pos-
sible.

At Macon...But not Here

Futhermore, one finds this week
two outstanding programs at the
neighboring schools of Sweet Briar
and Randolph-Macon; last weekend
saw the literary festival at Holiins.
Is there no room on our own ear us
for similar programs, dealing either
with the arts, or with the more mun-
dane realm of politics? If we are
proud of our own campus, as we
should have every reason to be,

 

A Slam At Slater

 

By DON CASTO

This afternoon as a freshman I
once again took my life in my hands
and ate “lunch” in the University
Commons.

I walked through the line, received
my ration of salad (appetizingly
speckled with hair), colored water,
and some kind of goo jokingly refer-
red to as a main course. But this
plethora of slime didn’t bother me
much because I encounter it every-
day. I picked at my “food” for sev-
eral minutes and then went to the
Corner Store for my daily bicarbon-
ate of soda.

A Profit Organization

The Commons is run by a catering
service that is a profit organization.
This fact is evident in the quantity
and quality of food served, and
there is no doubt in my mind that
this catering service manages to clear
a fair profit.

If the food is so unbearable, who

 

Student Blasts Commons

then eats in the Commons? The
answer is simple—only people who
are forced or bribed to. Freshmen
are required by the University to
eat there and domitory counsellors
and waiters eat there because the
food is free.

Very few people eat in the Com-
mons by choice, and this in itself
is a good indication that the Com-
mons is not serving the purpose for
which it was originally intended. Os-
tensibly this purpose was to provide
a place for students to obtain quality
meals cheaply.

One Accomplishment, Anyway

While failing in this, the Commons
did manage to accomplish one thing.
It helped to strangle fraternities.

Before the advent of the Com-
mons, freshmen ate at fraternity
houses and enjoyed high quality food
at the same price they pay now at
the Commons. They also had a great-

Ten years ago this week, Joseph
Stalin died, thus bringing to an end
one of the most brutal reigns of
tyranny in human history. By what-
ever standards one chooses to judge
him, to Stalin must fall the dubious
honor of being the arch-criminal of
all time. For thirty years he ruled
a great and gifted nation, inflicting
terrible atrocities on her people and
demanding a senseless sacrifice until
that nation had modernized her in-
dustry, exploded a nucleur bomb,
and sent satellites into orbit around
the earth.

Currents of Change

The Western observer cannot
help but be struck by the currents
of change that have swept through
Russia in the decade since Stalin’s
death. Seven years ago Khrushchev
launched a de-Stalinization cam-
paign in an attempt to discredit his
predecessor. While this attack was
largely a device which Khrushchev
used to consolidate his own power.
it nevertheless hinted to the Rus-
sian people that there would be a
thaw in the long winter of repres-
sion.

Other changes have had an !mport-
ant effect on Russian society. The

 

Russian economy has stressed the

The International Scene

 

development of heavy industry and
has never provided consumer goods
for the people on the same scale as
the Western nations. Moreover,
Khrushchev has still not found a so-
lution to the agriculture problem
and Russia can barely provide
enough food to feed her own people.
But the standard of living in the
Soviet Union is rising. Prosperity
and affluence, at least by Russian
standards, are coming slowly; the
Russians like this, and are beginning
to demand it.
New Intellectual Forees

New intellectual forees are also
altering the face of Russia. Although
still subject to strict official censor-
ship, Russian literature and art are
now experiencing freedom never per-
mitted during the Stalin era. In the
last three months, two books, one
about life in a Siberian slave labor
camp and one dealing with the ap-
palling atrocities committed against
the peasants of the Ukraine in the
1930’s, have opened to public seruti-
ny aspects of the Soviet past never
before discussed.

Thus an increased desire for ma-
terial well being and the impact of
new ideas on a literate and intel-

 

 

lectually excited public seem to have
moved the Soviet Union away from

the police state of Stalin and oriented
it more toward some form of liber-
al society. Where once the Russian
people sung the “Internationale” and
shouted “workers of the world
unite,” they now listen to Ameri-
ean jazz and Van Cliburn and their
slogan might soon conceivably be
“two chickens in every pot.”

How Long Will It Last

Yet one cannot help but speculate
on how real and how enduring this
liberal thaw in Russia will prove
to be. The terrible times of Stalin
are over and one cannot live in the
past. But it is necessary to realize
that the past will strongly influence
the present and the future. The en-
tire Russian historical tradition—both
pre-communist and Communist—
has been authoritarian. Periods of so
called “liberalism” in Russian history
have been characterized by a wide
gap between thought and action, be-
tween liberal ideas and the practical
application of these ideas to con-
structive social change. And _ the
liberal thaws of the past have gen-
erally been followed by periods of
cruel repression.

The question remains unanswered
as to whether the Soviet leaders can
escape their own tradition of viol-

 

 

The Washington And Lee Way:
Tradition-Bound Provincialism?

why are there no conventions and
seminars in which other schools are
invited to participate in a more-or-
less official capacity. Washington and
Lee does a great thing every spring
by having the SIPA meet here: why
could not the same thing be done for
University students, as well es for
those from high schools? Some prog-
ress has been made in this era
through the various debating activ.-
ties, but there is much more room
for development here. Why, for ex-
ample, cannot our own _ Interna-
tional Relations Week be mace into
a seminar with official participation
and representation from other
schools, perhaps in the capacity of
discussion leaders, and moderators
of student panels and forums? A
great university is determined, not
only by what goes on inside the
classroom, but by what goes on out-
side as well, and it is here that our
work is cut out for us.

A Student Responsibility

Move, however, is needed than of-
ficial University sanction and sup-
port of such activities, although such
support would seem to be a prere-
quisite for any further dialogue. The
final responsibility for dealing with
the provincialism that plagues us
lies in the students themselves. We,
as students, must realize our re-
sponsibilities in this direction and
seek out new channels in which to
work and be effective; even more
important, we ourselves must be
willing to work to overcome our
provincialism, recognizing the dan-
gers inherent in refusing to act. Pur-
ing the four years we are studerts
we are freer than at any ‘er
time in our life; yet even this free-
dom must be vigorously exercised,
if we are to keep it.

 

Lemmon Reveals
Alcoholic’s Fate
In Current Film

By TOM PACE

Blake Edwards is a peculiar di-
rector. He has made three films in
a year and a half and each one is
completely different. “Breakfast at
Tiffany’s” was warm, funny, enter-
taining and fairly well handled
“Hollywood” film. “Experiment in
Terror” might have been titled “Ex-
periment in Photography,” since Ed-
wards becomes so concerned wi‘)
how and where to use his camera
that you lose interest in the story

Now, “Days of Wine and Roses” is
here. (Starts at the State on Sun-
day.) He seems to have forgotten
both his previous efforts, for in this
one he throws scenes on the screen
apparently only as vehicles for his
actors.

The plot is fairly simple. Jack
Lemmon meets Lee Remick. Jack
and Lee date, Jack drinks; Jack and
Lee fall in love, Jack drinks; Jack
and Lee marry, and they both drink.
Jack becomes less and less success -
ful as a public relations man until
his clients wonder if Jack is selling
himself or Scotch. He loses his job.
The film then becomes his struggle
against aleohol and his struggle for
it.

(Continued on page 4)

A Liberal Movement In The Soviet Union

ence, whether Khrushchev is still a
prisoner of lessons he learned in
Stalin’s brutal political school. Cer-
tain factors would seem to indicate
that indeed this may be the case.
Certainly the Soviet leaders are
aware of what may happen when
people are allowed to freely examine
their own past, when the potentiali-
ties of the mind are released for
speculation, and when people begin
to work for their own personal well
being. Certainly Khrushchev realizes
that a despotic and militant Red
China is ready to pick up the stand-
ard of an international communist
revolution if the Russians choose to
abandon it.

The Essence of the Problem

The essence of the whole problem
however, is not whether the Khrush-
chev regime is better, or more lib-
eral, or enjoys a higher standard of
living than that of Stalin. Rather
it is that a single group of men con-
tinues to maintain an ideological and
political monoply in the Soviet
Union. As long as the rulers fail
to change, both in theory and prac-
tice, the monolithic structure of
Russian political life, they will not
have emerged from under the shad-
ow of Stalin,

Alumni Fall, 28-0, In Spring Game

 

Barranco, David Pace Varsity Triumph

Generals’
Depth Best

In 3 Years

Washington and Lee’s football Gen-
erals unveiled a new offense—the
strong arm of junior quarterback A.
J. Barranco—Saturday as they swept
to a 28-0 victory over the Alumni.

Barranco, a defensive standout for
two years, moved into control of the
Generals’ offensive machine in the
fourth period and guided the Gen- !
erals to two quick touchdowns.

Molyneaux Scores

Early in the period, Barranco cli-
maxed a 45-yard drive with a two-
yard heave to end John Molyneaux.
Halfback Skip Chase set up the
tally with a 25-yard gallop around
right end.

Barranco finished his offensive
showing after Dan Flournoy put they
varsity into scoring territory by in-
tercepting a Chuck Lane pass at
the Alumni 45.

28-Yard Pass

After several running plays, Bar-
ranco uncorked a 28-yard scoring
aerial to halfback Bill David. Full-
back Syd Butler added the game’s
only conversion on a dive over
tackle.

In addition to his TD tosses, Bar-
ranco connected on four of five
passing attempts.

The varsity wasted little time in
starting on its way to its first win
in the varsity-alumni series. The
record now is 1-0-1 in favor of the
varsity.

Safety

The blue team’s front wall broke
through the alumni in the first per-
iod and tackled a wandering alumni
in the end zone for a safety and a
quick 2-0 lead.

The Generals upped their lead
to 8-0 after a 65-yard march near
the end of the first stanza.

David Tallies

Quarterback John McDaniel got
the drive rolling with a 10-yard pass
to David. Fullback Dan Manson then
raced 20 yards around left end to
give W&L first and goal at the
alumni two.

David then put six points on the
scoreboard, plunging off left tackle.
Sackett
Henry Sackett, junior speedster,
handed the varsity a 14-0 halftime
lead when he scampered 60 yards on

Hollins’ Herd Captures
Another Diary Prize

The Hollins College dairy herd
has again been judged the best in
Roanoke County by the Dairy Herd
Improvement Association, according
to an article by the Roanoke Times.

The Hollins herd was recorded
for the month of January at an aver-
age of 52.7 pounds of fat per cow,
a solid three pounds above the
average of its closest follower in the
fierce competition.

During the month, however, the

Hollins females failed to place in
high cow milk production, which
was led by Catawba Sanatorium.
Figures of Hollins production per
cow are unavailable.
The Hollins group consists of 49
cows. Their average pounds of fat
in January was up about nine
pounds from their preceding aver-
age, a very creditable gain.

Lemmon Reveals
Alcoholic’s Fate

(Continued from page 2)

Lemmon Hilariously Funny

Both Lemmon and Miss Remick
are remarkable. As you might
imagine Lemmon is hilariously fun-
ny much of the time. What you may
not imagine is that Miss Remick has
the funniest moment in the movie.
This is the scene in which Lemmon
comes home from work having be-n
demoted. The two of them begin to
to talk about how unfair the firm is
to Jack, deciding that his demot:on
is due completely to office polities. It
is when Miss Remick repeats,
“Honey, you know it’s just politics,”
that everything hits you. She is silly
drunk, and she pulls it off so well
that she should receive the loudest
laugh for her achievement, having
stolen the scene from the more ac-
complished comedien next to her.

Other Good Sceenes

Several other scenes are very fine:
Lemmon and Remick drunk in a
bedroom at her father’s house; Lem-
mon vehemently smashing the potted
plants in a greenhouse that has hid-
den his last bottle; Miss Remick
drunk and Lemmon sober in a motel
room; and the final scene between
the two when he is well and she is
not, very moving in its inconclusive-
ness. They both evoke pity as well as
laughter. Their range of emotions
seems unlimited.

Unfortunately, a good film must
have more than expert acting, and
this one rarely does. Many lines are
trite and poorly conceived, as weil
as inappropriate. Edwards may have
been drunk when he edited the film,
for the editing is both choppy and
illogical. At last, however, he seems
to have mastered his camera. His
angles and shots are no longer forced
but are natural and interesting. The
four scences mentioned above illus-
trate this more clearly. And he must
be praised for his direction of Lem-
mon and Miss Remick.

er contact with upperclassmen and
their individual fraternities.

This extremely important contact
has been irrevocably lost as long as
the present system remains in effect.
Fraternities, debt-ridden and finan-
cially frustrated before the Com-
mons, now with the loss of a large
freshman revenue, are in may cases
struggling to stay alive.

Whether intentionally or not, the
Commons does detract from the
function of fraternities. Previously
freshman contact with upperclass-
men through fraternities provided a
means of assimilating freshmen into
the life and traditions of the Uni-
versity. Now with the Commons this
function has been nearly destroyed.

This is evident in the fact that
since the opening of the Commons
each new freshman class has been
more difficult to assimilate into the
University and has conflicted more
with University traditions and regu-
lations. The Commons has failed to
replace this vital function formerly
provided by the social fraternity.

What is the Commons doing for
Washington and Lee? Obviously not
very much.

Who has benefited from the Com-
mons? Well, the fraternities haven't,
the students haven't, and the Uni-
versity hasn’t. Who has?

relaxed.” I will agree with the edi-
torial’s point that in this instance
the conventional dress rule had
often been violated. However, I be-
lieve that any attempt to deduce
from this scarcely surprising finding
the effect of allowing freedom in
dress could only be inconclusive.

The recent permissiveness had
encouraged students to act juvenilely
in trying to see how much they
could get away with, as is always
the case under our present system.
On the other hand, real freedom in
this matter would encourage stu-
dents to act responsibly and mature-
ly.

If the Assimilation Committee and
the Executive Committee were to
permit a true experiment by tem-
porarily abandoning or modifying
the conventional dress rule, it would
have to be for a considerable period
of time. It would take some time
for a more mature attitude to replace
the present one.

I, like everyone else, can only
speculate concerning the attitude
which would then develop. In my
opinion there would always be some
who would not voluntarily wear
conventional dress, even to class.
These men would be able to have a
more positive attitude toward the
school than now when they often
view the rule as a threat to their
personal integrity and even deate
whether they should pay a few cents
or allow themselves to be suspended
from school. Although to most the
rule may seem so minor and so easy
to obey, to others it is the most

constant reminder, even more than
the present cut system, of all the
liimtations on individual responsi-
bility which exist here.

Among the justifications given for
the present rule are two which are
somewhat contradictory. One con-
siders this matter so important that
deviation is a threat to our way
of life and therefore cannot be allow-
ed. The other, sometimes given by
the same persons, maintains that,
after all, this is such a minor rule
that no one should have any trouble
accepting it. It seems to me that
the problem is neither too conse-
quential nor too trivial to involve
the principle of toleration and re-
spect for others.

My general impression is, how-
ever, that the overwhelming ma-
jority would come to abide by at
essential aspects of conventional
dress. After the tradition had be-
come established, I see no reason
why incoming freshmen would not
continue to abide by it as at UVa.
The conventional dress tradition
would be much stronger in its ability
to permit diversity.
