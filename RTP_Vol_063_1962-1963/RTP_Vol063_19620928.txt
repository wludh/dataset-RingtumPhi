Big Weekend Festivities

By KEN LANE
Assistant Managing Editor
Clyde McPhatter, one of Rock ’n’ Roll top-selling record-

ing artists, has been contracted to play for Opening Dances
on Friday night, October 19, Dance Board President Frank

The Troubadour Theatre will begin its 1962-63 season on
October 31 with the production of “Inherit the Wind” by
Lawrence and Lee. In addition to this premier production the
Troubs will also present Moliere’s ‘“Tartuffe” and a festival of

one-act plays to be directed by advanced students.
“Inherit the Wind,” which was a* 3 -

hit on Broadway and was later made
into a motion picture, centers around
the famous Scopes “monkey” trial of
the 1920’s. It was at this trial that
Clarence Darrow and William Jen-
nings Bryan, the two most famous
living orators of the time, met
face-to-face in the Tennessee court-
room in a battle that went beyond
the confines of that room.

The play has an unusually large
cast, with an opening for 25 roles.
Dr. Jones has auditioned 31 tryouts
and has announced the selection of
14. They are as follows: Bruce
Whelihan, Howard Schramm, Garret
Kratzig, Sid Parham, Harwich Stew-
art, Paul Balich, Pete Manson, War-
ren Montgomery, Bo Earnest, Rene
Reixach, Bill Atwell, Cary Williams,
and Drew Baur. Rehearsals began
last Wednesday night.

“Inherit the Wind” will be playing
from October 31 to November 3.
The second play, “Tartuffe,” is
scheduled for February 27-March 2;
and the third show, a festival of
one-act plays ,will be May 8-11.

The cost of admission wil be $3.00
for adults and $2.00 for students.
Dr. Jones stated that reservations
will be necessary for all the plays
and this includes subscribers of
season tickets as well.

Under the limitations of a small
theater and a restricted stage area,
the Troubadours have done an amaz-
ingly successful job in provding the
student body with top quality enter-
tainment. This year Dr. Jones antici-
pates an even more successful sea-
son.

Deb

By STEVE SMITH

The national debate topic under- |
went its first public scrutiny at|
Washington and Lee yesterday af-|
ternoon as Dr. John Gunn lectured
to about 50 boys on the question,
Resolved that the non-communist
nations of the world should unite in
an economic community.

Dr. Gunn’s lecture was the second
meeting this week for the debate
team. At the team’s initial meeting
Monday night 64 students, the larg-
est number ever to express interest
in debating at W&L, heard brief
talks from the school’s top debaters.

Also this week debate coach Wil-
liam Chaffin announced that the
team will open the 1962-63 sea-
with a television match
against Old Dominion College
(formerly William and Mary at
Norfolk) over WAVY-NBC,

son

In his lecture Dr. Gunn viewed
the question as representing the in-
fluence of three major trends in
Western civilization, the first being
the integration of small into large
political units. Economie union, he
said, is a step toward political union.
He used the example of German
unification having been hastened by
the establishment of the Zollverein,
a mere tariff union which tied to-
vether the small German states.

Integration of Nations
The second trend, said Dr. Gunn,
is toward political integration of
nations, resulting in international
organizations. This movement began
with diplomatic gathering of the

strong

In addition to these historic trends,
said Dr. Gunn, the recent funda-
mental division between the Sino-
Soviet block and the Free World
bears directly on the debate topic.
This split has made it crucial that
the non-communist nations cooper-
ate with each other in order to re-
main free.

Having sketched this background
for the debate, Dr. Gunn explored
the possible arguments of the case.
The affirmative need for an economic
community is strong because of the
definite threat offered by commun-
ism. The benefits of the plan would
be increased prosperity, through
| more efficient use of resources, pro-
duction, and trade; and increased
unity in the West, which would en-
hance free world security against
the Soviets.

The negative argument to the pro-
josal could counter that non-
communist community

hatred between such pairs as India
and Pakistan, and Israel and the
| Arab League. As
| negative could counter with the
|idea of an Atlantic community,
| which would unite only nations with
common interests and heritages .

Dr. Gunn, who calls the
topic the most exciting in years for
college debate, could not satisfy the
curiosity of his audience in his two-
hour talk. The lecture will be con-

Dance Plan Sale
Hit Record High;

946 Tickets Sold

The Washington and Lee Dance |

Board has received an unexpected
| landslide of support this year from
| the student body.

An all-time record for number
| of dance plans sold has been set this
| fall with a total of 946. This figure
| represents about 92 per cent of the
student body and exceeds by over
100 last year’s total of 839.

Young Pleased

Frank Young, president of the
Dance Board, is highly pleased with
this year’s results: “On behalf of
the Dance Board, I would like to
extend my appreciation to the stu-
dent body for its outstanding sup-
port Thanks to this splendid coop-
eration, we can assure W&L of an
unprecedented year of top quality
entertainment that can be matched
by few other universities in the
| country.”

| Guest Tickets Available
| This year for the first time, the
| Dance Board is offering special
| guest tickets fo rthose who have
| bought dance plans. These tickets
| will allow a three dollar discount
| from the normal price of weekend
| concerts for friends of dance plan
| subscriptions. Instead of having to
pay the usual $8 for a concert, visit-
ing friends will only have to pay
$5. Young announced that any sub-
| scriber intersted in securing guest
tickets can apply for them by writ-
ing to him, post office box 458.
Young also announced that those
who have not picked up their dance
plans can get them at the Co-op

Also highlighting the dance will
be the selection and crowning of
this year’s Homecoming Queen,
which will take place during inter-
mission. The figure will consist of
a candidate for the honor from
each house, escorted by her date.

Having held the spotlight of pop-
ularity for 10 years, McPhatter has
kept record sales skyrocketing with
such hits as “Little Bitty Pretty
One,” “Lovey Dovey,” and “Ta Ta!”

“Clyde and his band _ specialize
not only in Rock 'n Roll, but also in
a variety of good dance music,”
Young remarked.

A native of Durham, N. C., Clyde
had a rich background of religious
music before being persuaded to
join the newly formed group, The
Dominoes. The young singer was
a smashing hit and a key figure in
the group’s orbit to fame. Among
the records which won The Domi-
noes their booming success were
“Do Something for Me,” “Have
Mercy, Baby,” and “These Foolish
Things.”

“Clyde's vocal tricks and _ his
effortless upper register crooning
style became the rage among vo-
cal groups and he was much copied
and imitatied,” one critic observes.

Clyde left the Dominoes in Sept.,
1953, to lead his own group, The
Drifters. Within two months after
they were formed, Clyde and his
group has recorded a big hit with
“Money Honey.” Other best-sellers
were “Such A Night,” “Honey Love,”
and “White Christmas,” the last
equalled in seasonal popularity only
by the Bing Crosby version.

In 1954, the star’s career was
interrupted by a call from Uncle
Sam. During his Army days, he
performed vocal solos at numerous
service shows. He was so successful
at this that he decided to go it
alone when discharged from the ser-
vice. During furloughs, he put out
such impressive releases as “Seven
Days.”

On his return to civilian life in
the spring of 1956, success began
to snowball, A fruitful nationwide
tour and a new record, “Treasure
of Love,” put Clyde on the pedes-
tal of fame.

“Clyde is a crowd pleaser; his
good looks and ingratiating person-
ality put the audience on his side
from the moment he steps from the
wings—his voice holds them after
that,” a critic remarked.

On numerous tours throughout the
country, Clyde has performed at
such outstanding theaters and clubs
as the Apollo in New York; the
Howard in Washington; the Royal
in Baltimore; and the Casino Theater
in Toronto.

A Warning—Before It’s Too Late

This is as good a time of the year as any to preach on traffic

safety and good driving habits. If the usual pattern holds, i

can be expected that three or four times during the year the
Ring-tum Phi will be able to come out with a headline to the

effect that

words of a similar nature. Like the man in the funny paper

says, they’ll do it every time.

Along this line, this seems to be an ideal opportunity to
reprint an old Ring-tum Phi editorial, dug out of our musty
files by the peons assigned to do such things.

Written by Phil Grose, editor of the Friday edition for the

1959-60 school year, this appeared on September

“Fun Behind the Wheel”

the title

25 under

Why not prove to your dates these next weekends
that you have a fast car. Wouldn’t that be fun?

Can you imagine the total thrill of seeing the joyous
sparkle in your date’s eyes as you carom about the

mountains this weekend?

You can both listen to the screaming tires—a sound
truly nicer than any symphony. And your date can ad-
mire your skill as you try to avoid the car ahead.

When you hit the car, your date will be thrown
through the windshield—if she is destined to be one of

the gay set.

And won’t she be fortunate, for the view from the
hood is so much better than from inside the car.

She won’t look as nice as she did back in the fra-
ternity house. But you can make up for that.

You can send her flowers. Won’t that make her

happy?

We agree with Editor Grose’s adroitly-expressed senti-
ments. Besides, if you go around smashing up cars and getting
blood and glass all over the roads, that makes them unsafe for

The roads are bad enough as it is, without your helping
make things worse by speeding or littering them with what’s
left of your windshield. Take it easy, gentlemen.

Information Service Hit
For Poor Game Coverage

(Editor’s note. Though we sym-
pathize with our friends from Il-
linois, the below criticism is en-
tirely misdirected. Under arrange-
ments with the Associated Press,
the Washington and Lee Informa-
tion Services are responsible for
reporting only home games. More-
over, our university takes pride in
having one of the most efficient
Information Services in the coun-
try.)

Dear Editor:

We are recent graduates of Wash-
ington and Lee and are, naturally,
interested in events and activities
occuring on the campus this fall. We
are especially interested in the foot-
ball team which blossomed into an
exciting, winning team while we
were undergrads.

The team has been undefeated for
the past two seasons and has re-
ceived well deserved national rec-
ognition. Of course we want to fol-
low the team this fall, and we are
particularly interested in knowing
the scores of the games.

We were somewhat miffed both
yesterday and today when scores
were pouring in from all over the
nation with one notable exception.
Nowhere, and we repeat, nowhere
could we find the W&L vs. Hamp-
den-Sydney score.

Score Not Available

CBS was ready to give the team
national attention on its “College
Scoreboard Roundup” which follows
the “Game of the Week” and is,
we're sure, watched by sports fans
throughout the nation, but the score
was announced as not available.
CBS had obviously hoped to give
the score because they had taken
the trouble to list the game on their
scoreboard.

We doubt that
next week since

want to give

scores, not waste space. They were
able to obtain some scores from
remote Virginia since they had the
GW vs. VPI game report from}
Roanoke along with many other
scores from the South.

Nonetheless, we swallowed our
disappointment and directed our
efforts toward other forms of mass
media, We fully expected to be
able to pick up the score on the
radio with a minimum of diffi-
culty. As you have probably |
guessed by now, this also failed.

However, we went to bed with full
confidence that we would arise in
the morning and find the

Lee Chapel Restoration

Work is progressing on the eleven |

Contract for
taking has been awarded to
John P. Pettyjohn Company

pre-

Restoration Funds

All funds for the project were
made available to Washington and
Lee last year by the Ford Motor
Company Fund of Dearborn,
Mich., to “help preserve one of
the South’s most prized land-
marks.” The Chapel is designated
as a National Historic Landmark
by the U.S. Department of The
Interior and is visited each year
by more than 30,000 persons.

Plans call for all work on
1963, in time for appropriate re-
dedication ceremonies at the close
of the University’s academic year,
President Cole said.

Built in 1867

Although the Chapel was con-
structed under General Robert E.
Lee’s supervision in 1867, the red
brick structure will be restored as
it existed in 1883, the year an addi-
tion to the building was made to
house the Lee family mausoleum and
the chamber containing the famous
Valentine recumbent statute of Lee.

Engaged as consulting architects
for the project was the Boston firm
of Perry, Shaw, Hepburn and Dean,
restoration experts who planned and
supervised the restoration of Colon-
ial Williamsburg. Specifications for
the Chapel work were drawn up by
the University architects Clark, Nex-
sen and Owen of Lynchburg.

Although the emphasis is on
restoration, President Cole said,
plans call for extensive improve-
ments which will assure the future
preservation of the Chapel and
its valuable contents. These will
include structural strengthening,
flreproofing, and air-conditioning,
the latter an aid in preserving a
million-dollar art collection in
the Chapel and hundreds of items
of Lee memorabilia in the Chapel’s
museum.

Experts

Restoration experts also have rec-
ommended certain changes in the
display of art work, museum items,
and the recumbent statute which
they believe will enhance the
Chapel’s appeal to the thousands of

All items in the Chapel have
been catalogued carefully in

campus to participate in this uni-
versity’s social program. Anyone in-
terested in guest tickets for Open-
ings Dances should write the Dance
Board, Post Office Box 458 in Lex-
ington.

Variety will be the key word of
this year’s University-sponsored
social functions. Variety not only
in the type of entertainment, but
also in the theme, setting, and
staging of each dance and concert.
In regard to entertainment, out-
standing performers in the fields
of rock and roll, folk music, mod-
ern jazz, and society dance music
will appear on the campus during
the major weekends,

The selection and crowning of
the Homecoming Queen during the
Friday night dance of October 19
should add a great deal to the
Openings Dance’ program. The
Dixieland Jam session planned for
the Fancy Dress Ball is a new touch
which should add a bit of variety to
that function.

New

In regard to setting and staging
effects, several innovations will be
made this year. An electrical, self-
contained water fountain has been
purchased by the Dance Board to
aid in the decorations of both dances
and concerts. Colored disc spot-
lighting will be standard equipment
at all of the concerts this season.

dual staging system will be effected

“Twixt optimist and pessimist the
difference is droll;

The optimist see the doughnut, the
pessimist the hole.” —Anon

With mixed feelings of optimism
and pessimism we set out to fill this |
space with mater-
ial which we trust
will be interesting

and_ informative |
to all—at least|
some — well, a

couple anyway.

Though Rush
Week seems to be
a traditional sub-
ject for commen- |
tary in a colum-
ist’s initial effort
of the year, we
will dwell only on the highlights.

We would like to recommend Hall
of Fame Honors for Sammy Simp-
son, W&L sophomore whose color- |
ful display of a latent stomach vir- |
us provided many with a sympa-|
thetic, but hearty, post-Rush Week
chuckle.

Also we echo the congratula-
tions already given to the string-
holding, whistle-tooting twosome
of Ross Kyger and Tony Schle-
singer. The efficient job done by
these two, plus a good crop of
freshmen, made it quite a success-
ful Rush Week.

In connection with this, Sehicsing:|
er will head another IFC committee |
which will re-examine Rush Week
to see if our present system shall |
prevail. Whether you feel the bat-
tle lines should be drawn against
the faculty, or that we should give |
in completely, or your sentiments |
are somewhere in between, atten-
tion should be given to the “find-|
ings” of this group.

of the year and we owe it to our-|
selves to discover what interesting
and amazing things can be found}
here.

of a good clothes buy go visit Ar-|

a staggering 71 years old, has been |
in this town since 1926 (a remark-
able feat in itself) and is an inter-

Lebanon Valley College. For those
of you who aren’t familar with
| the geography of Pennsylvania,
| Lebanon Valley is located in Ann-
| ville. If you need further clari-
| fication, Annville is in close prox-
| imity to Harrisburg(?).

Lebanon Valley is a_ co-ed
school, so chances are good they
will have cheerleaders. But we
have the Lexington High School
Band.

W&L will be outweighed by the
| opponents who, along with being
| heavier, have more returning start-
ers from last year’s 6-1 team. We
hope a good crowd will be on hand
to see the Generals go after an
| unprecedented 15th straight victory.

Lebanon Valley Challenges
WGL,; 20 Unbeaten Games

By NICK MONSARRAT
Assistant Sports Editor

The Generals will face a definite
weight problem this Saturday as
they hope to lengthen their twenty
game unbeaten streak against Leb-
anon Valley College in Lexington.

Boasting the best year in their
history last season Lebanon comes
to Lexington with a 6-1 record
and 225-pound tackle Glenn
Stetch who has gained much re-
spect from players and coaches
alike for speed and ability.

With thirteen lettermen returning,
nine of whom were starting last
year, the visitors from Pennsylvania
look to be a strong and heavy team.
Coach Lee McLaughlin cited quar-
terback Wes MacMillian and full-
back Fred Porrino as especially dan-
gerous to the lighter W&L line.

Yoffe May Be Out

Th Generals, just fresh from last
week’s 15-6 victory over Hampden-
Sydney, may be forced to play
without the services of halfback Stu
Yoffe due to a pulled leg muscle.
It is hoped that treatment may solve
the problem but no definite decision
has yet been reached as to his
condition.

In the case that he is sidelined, he
will be replaced by Jay Norman
who will be moved up from the Gold
or third unit.

John McDaniel has been named
as the starter at offensive quarter-
back for the Generals but Chuck
Lane will share the job throughout
the afternoon.

 

Bad Tires!

Some of the Turnpikes now
are barring autos that have
defective tires. Officials re-
port that over 30% of this
year’s fatal accidents on the
Pennsylvania Turnpike have
been caused by bad tires.

The main W&L weakness seems
to lie in the center of the line and
off tackle where the visitors have
a definite weight advantage, but it
is hoped that speed will be the de-
ciding factor in W&L’s favor.

Question of Depth

Also, the depth which was used so
much to the Generals’ favor last
year, may again appear with this
year’s Gold team. Coach Mack feels
that while they lack the experience
of last year’s third unit, they still
have the eagerness and drive to do
the job of backing up the first two
units. This year’s Gold team _ is
composed entirely of sophomores
with the exception of one junior.

Th Lebanon team is coached
by Bill McHenry, who was the
captain of the 1953 Washington
and Lee squad and who is the
brother of Washington and Lee
lacrosse and basketball coach Bob
McHenry.

team will be held Thursday or Fri-

Sharper Passing
And Teamwork

Aid In Victory

By DICK KREITLER

Washington and Lee’s soccer team
won its season opener with Pfeiffer
College by a score of 2-1, yesterday.

The W&L booters controlled play
throughout the game, but failed to
come through with the winning tal-
lies until the fourth period.

In the first half the Generals
had several scoring opportunities,
but bad luck and misplaced shots
on the extremely muddy field
hindered a score.

Co-captain Bob Pagano, although
he didn’t score, was undoubtedly the
outstanding player for the Generals.
His play making set up both goals
and aided in W&L’s domination of
the waterlogged ball.

Pfeiffer finally broke the scoring
ice late in the third period as two
of their players managed to get
past W&L’s secondary defense to
score.

A fired-up W&L team, led by
Pagano, Steve Hibbard, and Bruce
Jackson, picked up steam as
Pfeiffer began to tire in the fourth
quarter.

Steve Hibbard came through with |
the score that evened the game by |
taking a well placed pass from!
Pagano and booting in a cross shot
from twenty yards out.

A few minutes late, Junior Jim
Mell set up the next goal for Wash-
ington and Lee as he looped a pass
in front of the net which was headed |
in by Charlie Sweet.

The Generals managed to hold
off Pfeiffer for the remaining nine-
minutes without too much trouble.

Freshman halfbacks Wes Horner
and Frank Wakefield were instru-
mental in the victory as they made
their varsity debut.

(Continued from page 2) original interest or excitement. This
brings us to the crux of the matter:
what is wrong with W&L’s informa-
tion service.
It is hard enough for W&L to
retain its own identity even now.
We are constantly confused with
inferior but better known schools
such as W&M, F&M, and a hest
of other double name schools,
Yet, when publicity is offered to
us, we either shun it or muff the
chance to obtain it. It cannot be
denied that interested fans and the
members of the team itself deserve
to have the reports of all games
publicized as rapidly as possible

over nation-wide wire services.

The Crux of the Matter

Thus we are now sitting here, try-

the fact that we still do not have
one small piece of information, the
lack of which has come close to
disrupting our whole weekend.

we will, it will hardly contain its

He finished his academie work with
high honors.
In a letter written to Dr. Leyburn
shortly after Webster’s death, his
University of London professor ex-

pressed great admiration for this
“',.. quiet, studious man... of char-
acter.”

Webster's professor, Frank P.
Chambers, concluded the letter by
commenting that Ed’s thesis had

been going well, that he had im-
mensely enjoyed his stay in England,
and that his English academic com-
munity had suffered great loss by
his death.

Last year’s season of the Univer-

many years. With the majority of

prospects look good for this year’s
season being an even more suc-
cessful one.
