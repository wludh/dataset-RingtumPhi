Dr. S. P. Duvall Speaks Toni

By ROGER PAINE
Managing Editor

Tonight at 7:30 in the Student
Union the Washington Literary So-
ciety is sponsoring a talk on Her-
man Melville’s Billy Budd. Discus-
sion will be led by Dr. Severn P. C.
Duvall, head of the English depart-
ment,

In order that all those planning to
attend this talk may know the de-
tails of the story, this article will
summarize the book and some of
its implications. The movie Billy
Budd, which was adapted from a
play that was adapted from Melville’s
novel was recently featured at the
State.

Billy Budd was Melville’s last
novel, written shortly before he died
and never published during his life-
time. The book shows Melville’s
acceptance of the mystery and the
tragedy of life. It centers on Billy,
who is a handsome, simple, likeable
young sailor.

While serving on the merchant
ship Rights of Man, he is impressed
into military service for the Royal |

Navy by the master-of-arms
H.M.S. Indomitable. His name :
John Claggart, a mysterious figure
who the embodiment of evil
in the eyes of the crew.

The contrast between Claggart
and Billy is obvious from the start,
and the master-of-arms shows mal-
ice toward Billy for no apparent
motive. Billy maintains a tone of
forgiveness, however, which enrages
Claggart all the more.

Claggart trumps up a charge that
Billy is inciting the crew to mutiny,
and accuses Billy of this in front
of the Captain in the latter’s cabin.

stammers—and after being accused
by Claggart of this complete un-
truth, he cannot express himself
verbally. So he defends himself in
the only way left to him—by a blow
with his fist. It lands on Claggart’s
jaw, and a few minutes later the
ship’s surgeon pronounces him dead.

The character of Captain Vere,
who is the only witness, now enters
the novel. He is an excellent officer—

a recent mutiny aboard a ship of
the Royal Navy and he didn’t want
anything of the kind to happen on
the Indomitable.

After calling a court martial con-
sisting of his lieutenants, Captain
Vere poses the problem. They all
feel in their hearts that Billy should
not hang. If one considers the in-
tent of Billy, or the obvious lie
of Claggart, it would seem that Bil-
ly should be set free. Moreover, he
is a model sailor, loved by all the
crew—a man without a vice or an
evil intention.

But Vere points out to his subor-
dinates that these feelings cannot be
considered. Simple military justice
must prevail. The question of how
the members of the court can con-
demn to death a man whom they
feel to be innocent before God and
themselves is the crux of the trial.
In the end, it is held that the mili-
tary letter of the law must be

 

obeyed, and “however pitilessly that

ght On Melville’s ‘Billy Budd’

law may operate, we nevertheless
must adhere to it and administer it.”

Thus, Billy is hanged the next day
before the entire ship’s company.
The theme, is the age-old theme of
good against evil. The novel has
religious implications—Billy as a
Christ figure—and political rami-
fications. Oniy two men on the In-
domitable realize what a _ moral
phenomemon Billy was—Claggart
and Captain Vere. The former set
out to destroy Billy because he,
Claggart, was the eternal evil op-
posed to Billy the eternal good.
The latter was forced by the mili-
tary code to carry out Claggart’s
plan of destruction, despite his own
inner feelings.

Although this is a very rudimen-
tary summary of the major points
of the novel, it should enable any-
one not familiar with the story to
gain from Dr. Duvall’s remarks to-
night. The talk will not run over
an hour.

study tonight by Dr. Duvall.

Optimistic On Far East Situation

Dr. David Anthony, the final
speaker for the ninth annual |
national Relations Week, spoke

last
night on “The Sino-Indian Conflict.” |

Dr. Anthony is director of a special |
Asian studies program which is be-
ing sponsored at Randolph-Macon |

War II, Dr. Anthony gained ex-|
perience while serving as a Japanese |
language office in the Al- |
though he was awarded a Ph.D. from |
Yale University, he also attended |
Harvard, Cornell, and Princeton.

After discussing Chinese heritage,
Dr. Anthony divided his lecture into
four parts: (1) the intentions of the
Chinese government in regard to
India, (2) the significance of the
disputes for future development of
India, (3) relation of Communist
China’s policy towards India to the
doctrinal dispute in the Communist
Party, and (4) the significance of
the Indian-Sino border dispute to

Far East.

the free world.

Dr. Anthony pointed out that
China probably had four reasons for
the attack on India. Basically, the

 

Chinese were jealous of recent In-

| furthermore destroy

dian economic success, for the
Chinese want the rest of Asia to look
up to them—not India. Secondly, the
Chinese wanted to destroy Nehru’s
| leadership of the neutral bloc and
India’s leader-
ship in this bloc. Finally, the Chinese
wanted to obtain strategic spots on
the between China and In-
cia.

Continuing, Dr. Anthony proceed-
ed to the effeets of the conflict on
India. Of course, the movement by
the Chinese Communist destroyed
the unity of the Communist Party in
India. Moreover, the conflict has
caused the Indian economy to lag
money used to bolster the
economy must now be spent for de-

border

because

fense. Finally, the border dispute
has probably drawn the Indians
closer together in order to defend
their country.

According to Dr. Anthony, this
conflict has not caused all the Com-
munist Parties in Asia to oppose
China, but it has caused a split

among the parties and brought to
a point the underlying differences of
and Chinese Communism.

The ‘Free Day’

On Friday, May 24, there will be no classes. Last spring,
and every spring before it, a full day of classes was held on
that Friday. It is the day which immediately precedes the spring
set of final exams.

 

This new resolution was passed in the most recent meeting
of the faculty. It came as the result of an editorial which was
printed last fall in this edition of the Ring-tum Phi. The con-
tent of that editorial was approved by the EC and taken before
a faculty committee by an editor of this paper. The fact that
such a free day has been granted raises some important con-
siderations.

It shows, in the first place, that the faculty is concerned
with student opinions, and that when those opinions are well-
expressed and appear to have merit, they will be seriously
considered and acted upon. W&L has a teaching faculty which
is not willing to give up a day ordinarily devoted to classroom
activities in past years. The fact that they did so represents
a far greater step than some students may realize.

Secondly, the free day places a burden of responsibility
on the student body. Notice that this is an experiment, not a
permanent rule. The preservation of this opportunity for
greater study before exams depends on the manner in which
the students use their newfound freedom late in May.

But thirdly, and most important of all, studnts have some-
thing concrete which will most assuredly help them on their
exams if they use the time to advantage. Last semester there
could be nothing so concrete offered to the students because
the proposal came up too late in the term. Now that this more
definite move has been made, it remains to the students to
prove that they appreciate the chance given them.

Departing Professors

The announcement in today’s paper of Dr. T. E. Hughes’
decision not to return to W&L prompts us to comment on what
appears to be an unfortunate trend.

In less than a year, the University has lost three of its
most respected and well-reputed professors: Mr. Day in the
English department, Dr. Harvey Wheeler in the political
science department, and now Dr. Hughes, associate professor
of history. In each case, a man of real academic calibre, in the
eyes of students and faculty members alike, has been lost.

Mr. Day, whose conscientious preparation for classroom
lectures and unique ability to draw student interest made him
a popular instructor, left for greener fields of research at the
University of Virginia. A probable raise in salary and the
opportunity to work with some original manuscripts drew Day
to our northern neighbor—in addition, surely, to personal
reasons.

Dr. Wheeler, whose recently published Fail-Safe is topping
the current best seller lists, is taking a position at Yale gradu-
ate school where he will have more opportunity, we understand,
to write and to do extensive research. Wheeler’s reputation
among students as a thorough and highly qualified instructor
wasn’t enough, evidently, to keep him at W&L.

As for Dr. Hughes, who is reputedly one of the foremost
experts on technological history, we are indeed unhappy to
learn that he will not be returning in the fall. Hughes, to quote
a student who had him last year, “had the unique ability of
inspiring intellectual curiosity. The best possible estimate I
can give of Dr. Hughes’ teaching is that he made people want
to learn.” This, seemingly, was the general concensus among
students familiar with Hughes. He has decided, so we under-
stand, to take a position at MIT beginning in the fall.

However, it does seem unfortunate that within so short
a span of time three of the best qualified members of our
faculty should leave. Perhaps—and we believe this to be the
case—there is some relation between their departure and the
academic community here at Washington and Lee.

At least two of the men mentioned here were dissatisfied
with the University library. According to them, materials for
research and further study that they wanted to do was just not
available in the school stacks.

Complaints, too, have been voiced about professors’ hav-
ing to teach large numbers of courses, especially freshman and
sophomore courses. This in the opinion of the editor, is not
really a valid complaint considering the unique nature of Wash-
ington and Lee. It is a small school, and a teacher who doesn’t
want to teach seems a contradiction. Perhaps one of W&L’s
most attractive characteristics is that it has a teaching faculty,
not a long list of well-known researchers who seldom see the
inside of a classroom.

A further reason for professional dissatisfaction could
very well be money. Here we are not quite sure why such a
thing should be so. From all appearances, there are sufficient
funds to pay adequate salaries to men worth keeping at the
University.

Whatever the reasons—and there are probably many—
some serious consideration should be given to the loss of men
like Day, Hughes, and Wheeler. Possibly there are more facul-
ty members contemplating leaving, although we hope this is not
the case. Both administrators and students alike need to ex-
amine the implications behind the departure of worthwhile
faculty members from the staff. Some of the reasons for their
leaving, undoubtedly, lie within the University itself.

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

Mass Media Condemned As ‘Perverse’;
Kirkley Suggests Strict Censoring Law

 

Letters
To The
Editor...

Writer Criticizes
Lack of I-M News

I would like to remind the editors
of the Ring-tum Phi that there is
still an intramural program at this
university. Apparently they are un-
aware of this fact—for there has not
been a single line devoted to intra-
mural news all year. There hasn’t
been one article, one score, not even
a listing of the overall intramural
standings in the Ring-tum Phi.

Do the editors feel that there is
no longer any intrest in the intra-
mural program? Or do they feel that
it is too much trouble to walk over
to the gymnasium to check on in-
tramural results?

It is evident, I feel, that there is
still interest in the program; every
fraternity participates, there have
been very few forfeits this year;
and both players and referees, as
well as the Intramural Council, have
devoted a lot of time and effort to
making the program a success. If
interest and enthusiasm are less than
in past years, it is mainly the fault
of the papers’ failure to publicize
any of the intramural events.

Wouldn't it be possible to devote
a small portion of the valuable
space on the sports page to a list-
ing of intramural scores? Perhaps
one whole article might even be
printed occasionally—it certainly
would not detract from the overall
content of the sports page—it might
even add a little reader interest.

Sincerely,

ROBERT STAUFFER

 

 

 

Pace Acclaims
‘La Dolce Vita’
As Top Art Film

By TOM PACE

“La Dolce Vita” begins at the
Lyric Theatre tomorrow. It is di-
rected by Federico Fellini, and stars,
among others, Marcello Mastroianni,
Anouk Aimee, Yvonne Furneau,
Anita Ekberg, Lex Barker, and
Jacques Sernas. “La Dolce Vita” has
received twenty-eight important in-
ternational awards, ineluding Can-
nes Golden Palm and _ Venice’s
Leono d’Oro. Several publications
have acclaimed it as an all-time
classic, and many named it the
Best Film of 1961.

The Intellectual’s Plight

“La Dolce Vita’s” major theme is
that of the intellectual’s plight in
life. Marcello Mastroianni plays the
searching intellet employed by a
newspaper as its night-life colum-
ist. The story concerns seven days
in his life. During these seven days
Marcello is given chances at the
supposd keys to happiness. Also
during these days, several import-
ant characters confront the viewer.

There is the girl with whom Mar-
cello lives. She is simple and pretty
and is shown to us in contrast to
Marcello. Her only desires are to
love and be loved. However, Mar-
cello cannot love her, and she, like
him, is necessarily unhappy. Next
there is the wealthy girl who may
be had by anybody. Marcello comes
to believe that they might be happy
together, and tells her so. Yet while
she talks to him, another man, any
man, seduces her, and Marcello’s
glimmer is dimmed. The society col-
umnist has a successful novelist and
family-man friend named Steiner.
Steiner says that his way is no better
than Marcello’s and emphasizes that
fact rather subtly later on. Besides
Steiner, there is Marcello’s father,
who, when visiting the city, is taken
out on the town. But he cannot
stand the strain of fast life and
returns to the routine life at home
with his wife, Fellini introduces a
little irony by presenting a sixteen
year-old blonde girl, referred to
as The Innocent. In her Marcello
sees himself at the same age. And
you are to assume that she, too, will
have no chance, but will be en-
gulfed by the same society that
takes Marcello.

Key to Happiness

The theme is a somewhat simple
one. The film shows the frustrations
of man, the emptiness of man. There
is no real key to happiness. None of
the old answers—love, religion, sex,
family, suecess—can work for the
intellectual of today. A man’s search
leaves him as baffled as he was be-
fore starting. The theme is a uni-
versal one; it holds true in all coun-
tries. This is one reason for its
greatness.

But saying is not enough. How
something is said must also bear

(Continued on page 4)

 

By JOHN KIRKLEY

Culture is acquired, not inherited.
The aspirations, the convictions, the
ways of thinking, the patterns of ac-
tion, and the tastes of men are
formed by the impressions they re-
ceive from parents, teachers, the
mass media, and their peers during
the life-long process of socialization.
And since it is the earlier impres-
sions which are the most important
in the formation of the later man, the
impressions children receive should
be carefully sereened so that they
will develop into the kind of adults
we wish them to be.

Now this is certainly not the place
to embark on a detailed discusion of
what children should be made into
(and indeed, parents do make chil-
dren into something whether they do
so consciously or unconsciously); but
certain goals could surely be agreed
upon. We want our children to be
healthy, intelligent, imaginative hu-
man beings, capable of apprehending
reality in its many dimensions, and
able to use their abilities responsi-
bly to adapt that reality to the serv-
ice of mandkind. And I think we
could agree that we want our chil-
dren to develop excellence in their
own lives as well as strive to offer

 

their fellows the opportunity to real-
ize their unique forms of excellence.

Pernicious Impressions
Americans have devised many |
ways of systematically cheating their |
children (and all future generations) |
by consistently exposing them to|
pernicious impressions—ideas and
expressions deleterious to their de-
velopment into autonomous, intelli-
gent, imaginative human beings. One
way parents do this is by allowing
the mass media to flourish uncheck-
ed.

By “mass media” I mean such
forms of distribution of communi-
cable data as radio, movies, the
newspapers, advertising, magazines,
and_ television—occasionally termed
the “moronoscope” or “Boob-Tube”
by some. And the reason I feel these
mass media constitute a spreading
form of social atrocity is this: The
mass media, as their name suggests,
are designed to disperse large quan-
tities of communities matter to large
numbers of people, which they do;
most of the matter dispersed by these
mass media is banal, trite, colorless,
devoid of taste, unimaginative, non-
inspirational, and keyed to the baser
interests and desires of men rather
than to their nobler characteristics;

 

the impressions which we and our
children, receive from these mass
media influence our thought patterns
and therefore our motivations, aspi-
rations, ideals and behavior; there-
fore, the influence of the mass me-
dia is non-functional to the develop-
ment of free, responsible, and imag-
inative individuals.

To Think and To Act

People will do what they are
trained to do. If they are trained to
follow their inclinations, their emo-
tions, their desires, they will do so;
if they are trained to obey the dic-
tates of their intellect, their reasons,
their conscience, they will do so.
For this reason, it is important that
we teach our children, by word and
by example, to think and act in the
present as we would wish them to
act in the future.

Because the mass media are de-
signed to hold the attention of the
masses, they appeal to the universal
rather than the particular in man:
they appeal to our desire to be
amused, entertained, excited; to our
desire to feel alternate tension and
ego-gratification, security, a feeling
of well-being; and to our desire to
be informed.

Geared to the Average

Now obviously I cannot rail
against the disbursal of good enter-
tainment or accurate information;
but it is a fact that the mass media
provide little high calibre entertain-
ment and a paucity of accurate infor-
mation. And this is due to two
causes: first, the mass media are
designed to be understood by the
masses, rather than by the few, and,
therefore, the language and the forms
of entertainment employed by the
mass media are geared to the aver-
age, which is well-night equivalent
to the mediocre; second, and most
unfortunate, the audiences which
receive the impressions of the mass
media are content with what they
receive and will not demand either
high quality entertainment, a chal-
lenging program of instruction, or
even the presentation of relevant
and accurate information about
problems of current interest.

A further noxious effect of the
mass media is the pressure towards
conformity which is exerted by the
systematic presentation of similar
material to large numbers of people.
High school students from Miami
to Seattle listen to the same popu-
lar songs on the radio while riding
home from a sport event in which

 

similarly dressed teams played a
game following the same rules while
cheered by girls whose hair styles,
lipstick, and clothing are stereo-
typed for the nation. Fourth graders
throughout America spend hours
every day watching the same shows
on television or reading the same
comic books. In fact, the cheer-
leader, the mouseketer, and Super-
man are almost national heroes; they
are certainly as widely known as the
name of our president, but their
activities are followed by more peo-
ple with closer interest than are
the activities of President, Congress-
man, Ambassador, educator, labor
leader, businessman or even next-
door neighbor. People who receive
the same impressions from the same
sources will tend to look, think,
dres, and act alike.

Destroys Ability to Think

Perhaps the most harmful effect of
the mass media is that it destroys
our ability to think. Thinking is a
symbolic process; the higher forms
of thinking, including memory, com-
plex association, foresight, planning,
even average problem solving, and
all advanced communication, in-
cluding the possibilities of transfer-
ring and preserving knowledge, re-
quire language—the use of word
symbols. And the mass media, be-
cause they are designed to be under-
stood by the masses, use only a few
of the vast number of words made
available to us by our rich language.
By repeating these words over and
over, they limit our ability to think
by limiting our effective vocabulary,
by failing to stimulate our minds to
more complex thoughts, and by
wearing out the words they do use.

‘Boycott Mass Media’

The only way for us to avoid
the harmful effects of the mass
media, not only as they apply to us,
but more especially as they under-
mine the potential of our children
to develop into autonomous, intel-
ligent, responsible individuals, is to
boycott them individually and col-
lectively where possible, to keep
them from our children by refusing
their entrance into our homes, and
to demand better quality and greater
accuracy in the media we do receive.

We have passed laws to punish
rape and to discourage narcotics
peddling, why not develop laws, or
at least social sanctions, against the
evil effects of the mass media—
which cause a rape of the mind and
and a doping of the soul?

 

Author ‘Sounds Like a Writer’

Fishwick Retells Lee’s

By LARRY MEEKS

Dr. Marshall Fishwick explores
in great detail the years of Robert
E. Lee’s life beginning with 1865
and ending with his death and burial
here in Lexington in 1870, in his new
book, Lee After the War. This is
Dr. Fishwick’s eleventh book and
was published by Dodd, Mead & |
Company this past January. |

Dr. Fishwick, Professor of Amer-
ican Studies here at W&L, is cur- |
rently on leave doing research on
the teaching and presentation of
history on the secondary level at the
duPont Foundation in Wilmington,
Delaware.

Lee’s Last Years

Dr. Fishwick’s new book is an in- |
teresting study of the last years of
the General’s life, and contains much
of interest to students of Washing- |
ton and Lee, as the history of the
General’s last few years is necessarily
fused with the history of Washing-
ton College during that time.

Dr. Fishwick opens his book in)
Richmond just before the end of the |
war, where Lee is desperately try- |
ing to defend that city, the last hope |
of the Confederacy. Petersburg falls
and Appomattox isn’t far away.

Fishwick’s treatment of the sur-
render is one of the most moving |
parts of the book. We see General |
Lee don a spotless, new uniform and |
his jeweled sword to meet Grant!
at the McLean house.

‘It Was My Fault’

Lee did not look for a scapegoat
to blame the defeat of the South on.
Instead he simply said, “It was all
my fault. I thought my men were
invincible.”

Along with the story of Lee, Fish-
wick also ties in much of the history
of the times. His second chapter is
devoted to Lincoln’s visit to the
surrendered and half-burned city of
Richmond. He then describes events
in Washington in celebration of the
surrender of the Confederacy and
gives a short but effective account
or the assassination of Lincoln.

Lee was now back among his

|

 

 

family and the defeated people of

the South. Before long came the
visit from Judge Brockenbrough,
representing the trustees of Wash-
ington College requesting him to
become President of the bankrupt
college. His letter dated several days
after the visit is perhaps the most
famous that he penned.
Accepted Presidency

The letter read, in part, “I think it
is the duty of every citizen, in the
present condition of the country to
do all in his power to aid in the res-
toration of peace and harmony, and
in no way to oppose the policy of the
state or general government directed
to that object. It is particularly in-

| cumbent on those charged with the

instruction of the youth to set them
an example of submission to au-
thority, and I could not consent to
be the cause of animadversion upon
the college.” He went to say that
he would accept the judgment of the
Board of Trustees and if they still
desired him as president, he would
accept. Before long he was on his
way to Lexington.

In a few months he was called to
Washington to appear before the
Congressional Reconstruction Com-
mittee, headed by the bitter Thad-
deus Stevens. The committee grilled
him quite lengthily, but, accord-

ing to Dr. Fishwick’s account, was |

unable to even once make him lose
his temper or composure.
Interesting to Students

Dr. Fishwick’s chapter devoted to
Lee’s presidency here at W&L is a
most interesting one. He describes
many scenes familiar to W&L stu-
dents such as his office in the
basement of the chapel, of which
he supervised the construction. While
here at W&L Lee took personal
charge of the college finances and
instituted a system of meetings and
reports that made Washington Col-
lege a well organized institution.
He was familiar with the record of
every student and knew them all
by sight and name. He added many
departments to the college, and it
was during this time that the South-
ern Collegian came into being, then

 

Last Years

a “semi-monthly publication of liter-
ary societies.”
Trip Through Old South

Lee faced many problems here at
the college, but his greatest challenge
was a trip he made through the
South in early 1870. It began in
March and before it was over he
had traveled two thousand miles.
He was cheered everywhere as he
had become the symbol of ‘the Old
South and the Lost Cause.

On October 12, 1870, General Lee
died. The buildings of Lexington
were draped in black, including the
columns of Washington Hall. He was
buried near his office in Lee Chapel
in a plain, black suit.

Dr. Fishwick closes his book with
the following passage, which is in
essence, the theme of his book: “For-
get the Lee of battle, and see the
old man moving among Lexington’s
children. Forget the general in gray,
and see the old fellow in the black
suit moving back and forth between
his home and his chapel. Focus
sharply on this man. For this is
Robert E. Lee.

Forgive, Forget and Rebuild

Fishwick pictures Lee not as the
great general leading armies to vic-
tory, but as the great man striv-
ing to forgive, forget, and rebuild.

On the whole, Dr. Fishwick’s
book is an interesting and moving

| study of Lee’s last few years, but the

 

book is not without its faults. One
of these is over-stentimentality.
Fishwick is obviously a great ad-
mirer and praiser of Lee, and he
tends to allow his personal feelings
to bog down his account of several
of the incidents of the book.

He also tends to include many tri-
vial incidents in his efforts not to
exclude anything from his account.
In other passages, however, he
sounds like a writer and not merely
a historian writing a typical histor-
ical account of a man’s life.

Lee a God?

Another fault of the book is that
Dr. Fishwick seems to over-praise
Lee, presenting him as without fault

Thursday At Sewanee

 

WEL Faces Southwestern In CAC Tourney

By JOHN ALLGOOD
Sports Editor

An elimination match between
Southwestern at Memphis and Wash-
ingotn and Lee University will open
the first College Athletic Confer-
ence basketball tournament Thurs-
day at 9 pm. (CST) at Sewanee,
Tenn.

The winner of the Lynx-Generals
game will advance to Friday’s sem-
ifinals against tournament favorite
Washington University of St. Louis.
Game time is 7:30 p.m. The other
semi-final contest pits Sewanee
against Centre College at 9 p.m.

The championship is set for 9 p.m,
Saturday with a consolation game
preceding it at 7:30.

Washington Winning

Washington brings the only win-
ning record to the five-team event.
The Bears have sailed past most of
their 17 opponents easily. Only three
of their 11 wins have been by less
than 11 points—a pair of one-point
triumphs over Wheaton and Valpa-
raiso, and a three-point victory over
Eastern Illinois.

What’s more impressive about the
Bears is the type of competition

Randolph-Macon, the champions
of Virginia’s Little Eight Confer-
ence, invades Doremus Gymnasium,
tonight, in W&L’s final regular sea-
son basketball encounter.

The Generals hope to raise their
season mark to 5-11 before leaving
for the College Athletic Conference
tournament, beginning Thursday at
Sewanee.

R-M Tough

R-M poses a formidable threat
to the Generals’ ambitions. Big Frank
Kaminski, the nation’s eighth leading
rebounder in the small college ranks,
paces the Jackets’ attack.

Coach Bobby McHenry’s club will
be trying to rebound from their third
heart-breaking defeat at the foul
line—a 57-49 loss to Baltimore Uni-
versity Saturday.

For the third straight game the
Generals equalled or bettered their
opponents from the floor, only to be
outgunned at the charity stripe.

Sweitzer Leads
6th Frosh Win

W&L’s frosh basketball team,
playing its best game of the season,
axed Ferrum Junior College for
the first time in five years Friday,
62-55.

Paced by Steve Sweitzer, who
played despite a cold, and Bill Man-

ing away.

Manley’s Jumper Key

Bill Manley’s jump shot put the
Generals ahead to stay with 5:20
left in the game at 54-53. Tom Poore
followed with another jumper and
the Generals were on their way.

Two free throws upped the margin
to 58-53 and W&L went into a semi-
freeze.

Sweitzer, who managed only three
points in the first half, and Manely
paced the attack with 18 points each.

“It was truly a team effort,” said
coach Joe Lyles. “Everybody played
well.”

Following Sweitzer and Manley,
in the scoring was guard John
Moore, who played a terrific game
as the Generals’ playmaker, with 11

points.

Relay Fourth

A fourth place in the mile relay

A strong team of John Pearson,
John Barnes, Dave Myers, and Skip
Essex turned in 3:41.6.

Pearson, running leadoff, and Es-

top W&L times. Pearson ran a :54.5

ed by VPI, William and Mary, Old

low the Generals were the University
of Virginia, Roanoke, Bridgewater,

Lynchburg, Randolph-Macon, and

Despite capturing only three first
places, Monday, the W&L swimming
team tripped West Virginia, 50-45,
at Morgantown.

 

Sewanee was 2-1 on the strength
of a pair of triumphs over South-
western. Washington and Lee was
0-1 and Southwestern, 0-2. Since
Washington joined the conference
after it was formed, it did not sched-
ule any CAC games this season.

Washington’s Sandy Pomerantz, a
6-6, 210-pound senior from Univer-
sity City, Mo., could be the out-
standing individual performer in the
tournament. Pomerantz brings a 20.7
scoring average, a 10.9 rebounding
mark, a .461 field goal percentage and
a .763 free throw accuracy to Se-
wanee.

Fauber Tops

His nearest rival is a comparative-
ly small player—Washington and
Lee’s Rodger Fauber. Despite his
lack of height, Fauber, a 6-2, 175-
pound senior from Lynchburg, Va.,
has earned himself a place in the
national small college rebounding
leaders for the third straight year.

In 12 games Fauber has gathered
255 rebounds for a 21.3 average and

Mel Mounts scored a 5-0 win
over 123 pounder Butch West and

on its total value. Director Fellini
shows much imagination in putting
this film togther. He represents the
useless “keys” cleverly. He mingles
the characters in and out of the
story very well. He uses his camera
expertly, and draws fine prformances
from all of his actors, particularly
Mastroianni and Miss Aimee. Per-
haps, however, the finest technical
point of the film is Nino Rota’s mus-
ical score. His music is at all times
entertaining. Particularly outstand-
ing are the La Dolce Vita theme and
his rendition of Arrivederci Roma.
My only complaints with the film are
that it is sometimes a litle slow and
at other times too grandiose, too
gaudy. Nonetheless, Fellini has pro-
duced a major work in the cinema;
and his accomplishment is a fine one.

‘Lee In Review

(Continued from page 2)

and his final chapter, entitled “The
Resurrection” pictures Lee as the
“guardian angel of the South.” No
one denies that Lee was a great man,
but then he was a man not a god,
as Dr. Fishwick seems to believe.

The book does give a thorough
account of Lee’s last years and is
certainly of interest to students of
Lee and to people connected with
the University. The book has its high
points, and its weaknesses are
probably compensated for by these
to make the book worth reading.
