Graduates
Come Today

For Reunion

By CHARLES NEWMAN

This afternoon marked the
rival of many former students of
Washington and Lee who are re-
turning for Alumni Weekend. There
will be reunions of the classes of
1913, 1925, 1938, 1953, from both
the University and the Law School.
Many activties have been planned
for the alumni in order that they
will have an enjoyable weekend.

are

Friday's schedule of events is a
busy one, as is Saturday's. Regis-
tration of the reunion classes began
at 2:00 today, and President and
Mrs. Fred C. Cole held a reception
for the returning graduates from
4:30 to 5:30 at the President’s home.

Tonight at 8:00 in duPont Audi-
torium, Colgate W. Darden, Jr., will
deliver the first of the 15th annual
Randolph Tucker Law lectures. Mr.
Darden a former governor of
Virginia. He was also president of
the University of Virginia from 1947
to 1959. His topic tonight will be:
“Random Thoughts on Government.”

Gov. Darden will speak again
Saturday afternoon when he will de-
liver the second of the Tucker Lec-
tures. There will be an open house
for all alumni and guests held by
the School of Law. This will take
place at 9:15 Friday, following the
first Tucker Lecture. This year is
the second time that the Tucker
Lectures and W&L’s Law Day have
been scheduled to coincide with
spring alumni activities.

Saturday promises to be even
busier with registration in the
morning, tours of the campus, and
visits to classes and with faculty
members. A coffee will be held at
the President’s home at 10:30. Then
there will be the second Tucker
Lecture.

At 1:15 a luncheon for all alumni
will be held in Evans Dining Hall.
President Cole will preside and
take part in a report on the “State
of the University,” in which he will
be assisted by the deans of the Uni-
versity and by the president of the
student body.

For the sports minded alumni,
there will be a tennis match at 2:30
with Staunton Military Academy,
a baseball game with Frederick Col-
lege at 3:00, and an alumni golf
game at the Tri-Brook Country

~ NOTICES

On Tuesday, May 7, free chest
x-rays will be given in the Dor-
mitory Parking lot in front of
Reid Hall frem 8:30 to 5:00. These
x-rays will take only a few sec-
onds and may mean the difference
between life and death. Chest
x-rays not only detect Tubercu-
losis, but also lung cancer and
enlarged heart. There is absolutely
no danger from the small dose of
radiation.

Doctors recommend that a
healthy invidivual receive one
x-ray a year. If detected early,
TB and lung cancer can be cured
relatively quickly. The trouble is
that most cases are not detected
until the disease is in an advanced
stage. The students and members
of the faculty who smoke should
be sure to take advantage of this
opportunity.

Troubadours Plan One-Act Plays

Washington and Lee’s Troubadour
Theatre will present two bills of
one-act plays beginning on Wed-
nesday, May 8, and running through
Saturday May 11. Notable is the fact
that each of the theater’s productions
will be directed by an advanced
drama student under the general
supervision of Dr. Ceeil D. Jones,
head of the drama department.

On the nights of Wednesday, May
8, and Friday May 10, the Trouba-
dours will present Jean Girondeux’s
“The Appolo of Bellac” and Samuel
Becket’s “Krapp’s Last Tape.” Di-
recting “Apollo” is Senior Andy
Leonard, a fourth year veteran of
the Troubs, who is majoring in His-
tory and Spanish. Senior Andy Adel-
son, the theater group’s seasonal |
stage-manager, is directing “Krapp’s
Last Tape.”

Mahan Winners

 

Announced By |
Dr. Duvall |

The winners of the George A. Ma- |
han Awards for Creative Writing |
were announced today by Professor |

Duvall, head of the English De- |
partmen. |
Four awards were presented in|

all: two for junior prose, and one;
each for poetry. |

The winner of the freshman award
was Tony Outhwaite for short
story entitled “The Finished Pro- |
duct.” Dr. Duvall describes the |
story as “A cynical reverie by
graduating senior of his four hypo- |
critical and wasted years.”

Sam Ansell won the sophomore
award for “Old Paul Was My Best
Friend,” which Dr. Duvall calls “A
vingette revealing an indebtedness
to idiom and tone, especially recall-
ing Sallinger’s Holden Caufield.”

The two junior awards were won
by Bill Kinsey and Paul F. Van
Avery. Kinsey's story “The Birthday
Gift” is described as “having a con-
trol of idiom and structure that
suggests Reynolds Price.” Van
Avery's story “Moira” is described
by Dr. Duvall as “a first person nar-
rative of a love story “between a
water nymph and a fisherman.”

“There no award for poetry
beeause the entries in that category
were dissappointing,“ says Dr. Du-
vall; “on the other hand, the junior
prose division extremely dif-
ficult to judge beeause there were
so many good ones. Overall, we were
encourged by the number of entries
but would hope they would increase
in the future. I frankly enjoyed
reading them. I hope that there is
an increase in serious writing on the
campus.”

The Mahan Awards consist of
$100 exemption from college fees the
year following their presentation or
$60 in cash. They judged by

Candidates Stress Honor System
s Primary Issue Of Campaign

By MIKE HASH

Although many members of the
student body may feel that the
class elections to be held on Mon-
day evening are based primarily on
personalities, a pole of the candidates
running for E.C. positions has re-
vealed significant issues. In order
that the student body might have
an opportunity to view the opinions
of these candidates, they were each
asked to submit a statement con-
cerning the role of an E.C. commit-
teeman.

Jim Sylvester, Kappa Sigma and
Progressive Party candidate for sen-
ior class E.C. position, expressed the
following opinions: In regard to the
Honor System Sylvester feels that
it is the responsibilty of the E.C. to
continually reinterpret the ideal of

honor for the benefit of the students,

ductions. The student directors view
their efforts as a challenging exper-
ience finding satisfaction working
with their casts of young actors.
The work of the directors however,
does not lie solely in the direction
of their casts. They are also respon-
sible for their own sets, costumes,
and make-up.

Season ticket holders should make
reservations for each bill on their
ticket. For reservations call HO 3-
2128 or extension 273. The curtain
rises for each production at 8:30
p.m. sharp.

Famed Mnwie Critic MacDonald
To Speak On Current Cinema

By TOM PACE

Dwight MacDonald, one of Amer-
ica’s finest literary and film critics,
will be at Washington and Lee on
Monday, May 6. He will talk at
8:15 p.m. in duPont Hall on the sub-
ject, “The Cinema Today: Avant-
Garde and Rear Guard.” He is ex-
pected in his talk to touch on films
of varied quality from several dif-
ferent countries. Mr. Taylor’s ReVue
society sponsoring this lecture.

Mr. McDonald is the film critic
for Esquire magazine. Before going
there, he was a regular writer for
The New Yorker. He also writes,
with a degree of regularity, for
Film Quarterly, the finest publica-
tion of its kind in America, and
Commentary and Artisan Review,
which is also a highly respected lit-
erary journalism of criticism. He is
a graduate of Yale University (1928).

in the United is par-

‘ ticularly noted for being clever, per-

controversial nature which makes
him a promising, attractive speaker.

In 1948, he wrote Henry Wallace:
The Man and the Myth, a biting at-
tack on the former Vice-President
and influential political leader.
Awarding to Arthur Schlesinger, it
was “a brilliant slashing attack with
a cogency of evidence and

Quarrel with Cozzens
In 1957, Mr. MacDonald
involved in the most interesting
literary quarrel of the year. His
quarrel was with James Gould Coz-
zens, and Mr. Cozzen’s prize-win-
ning best- selling novel By Love
Possessed. Primarily because of Mr.
MacDonald’s bitter review, this novel
was brought down from its faslely
acquired heights. Newsweek report-
ed this quarrel, and described Mac-
Donald writer of great zest
and polemic skill, and a past master
of comic ridicule.”

In the last four years, Mr. Mac-
Donald has quarreled with many
other film erities concerning many
films. At the very least, Mr. Mac-

Donald promises to be an interest-

and to especially assimilate the
freshmen into the true spirit of the
Honor System. An attempt should
be made to remove fear as a_ basis
of respect for the Honor System.
Finally, the emphasis on the tradi-

tions of the University must be
maintained, but with a greater
amount of liberality rather than
force.

Syd Butler, SAE and Progressive
Party candidate for senior class
E.C. post, is concerned with keep-
ing the student bedy interested in
elections. He hopes that the voters
will become familiar with the quali-
fications of all the nominees, and at
the same time be aware of his ability
and earnest desire to serve the
student body as a member of the

E.C.

Buck Ogilvie, Beta and U.P. nom-
| inee for senior E.C. ecommitteeman
| supports the platform of the recently
‘elected student body officers with a
single addition. He would like to see
a mock honor trial held for the
purpose of acquainting the students
with honor trial procedures. Ogilvie
feels that his previous experience
on the E.C. would enable him to be
a valuable guide to the new mem-
bers of the E.C.

 

Candidates for the junior class rep-
resentative to the E.C. include Lamar
Lamb, a _non-fraternity student,
Skipper Chase, KA, Malcolm Mor-
ris, SPE, and Larry Manning, Beta.
Lamb has proposed a change in the
Honor System which was presented
to students in a circular. Coneern-
ing this change, Lamb issued the
following statement, “The views ex-
pressed in this proposal are mine and

 

not necessarily those of the other
candidates or my party.”

Skipper Chase, U.P. candidate, in-
tends to express his views personal-
ly as a part of his campaign. Mal-
colm Morris, Progressive Party nom-
inee, made the following comment
on the Honor System: “I feel that
the student body needs a more ex-
act definition of the boundaries of
honor system applicability. I am in
favor of a mock honor trial for all
students and much more intense as-
similation for freshmen into the
honor system,

Larry Manning, U.P. Candidate,
expressed this view on the Honor
System: “As a member of the stu-
dent body of Washington and Lee
and a candidate for an E.C. position,
I feel that the Honor System should
be maintained as it is. The strength
of Washington and Lee lies in the
Honor System and to weaken that
System in any way would certainly
weaken Washington and Lee.”

Chuck Walker, Kappa Sigma and
P.P. candidate for sophomore rep-
resentative to the E.C., is trying to
meet as many people as possible so
that he will be more than a name on
a campaign poster. He stressed his
particular interest in the proposed
student-faculty forum, and his de-
sire to introduce the Honor System
to freshmen in greater detail.

Gareth Aden, KA and U.P. nomi-
nee for sophomore representative to
the E.C., considers student-faculty
relations most important. Aden con-
tinues, “I realize the great respon-
sibilities of holding an E.C. position,
and if elected I will do my best not
to abuse this responsibility.”

An Endorsement

The following editorial, while it may be controver-
sial, is the conviction of the new staff of this paper, and

it is intended to encourage remarks on the subject.

Yesterday a candidate for next year’s Executive Com-
mittee issued a sheet in which he advocated a change in the
penalty levied for an Honor System violation. The candidate
has proposed that the present absolute expulsion regulation
be replaced with automatic expulsion for a year, with violator
subject to re-entry upon review of his case by the Executive
Committee.

The Friday Ring-tum Phi wholeheartedly endorses the pro-
posed change as a real step forward in the betterment of the
Honor System for several reasons:

First of all, it seems inconsistent that in a University dedi-
cated to the Christian ideal, a student guilty of a single indis-
cretion should be banned without a chance for either forgive-
ness or rehabilitation. What the “no second chance’’ penalty
says, in effect, is that the convicted violator is permanently
and irrevocably dishonorable. This appears to be the implicit
claim in the permanency of the present penalty. Obviously,
forgiveness is a fundamental element in the compasisonate
Christian Ideal. Our University supports this ideal, while equal-
ly supporting a system which not only precludes forgiveness
but also necessitates a very un-Christian kind of retribution.

Secondly, we sincerely feel that the Honor System exists
FOR the students, not the students for the system. While surely
we do support the Honor System, we abhor the very real
practical and psychological damage that it can do to a basically
honest individual.

If the additon of a bit of compassion will weaken the sys-
tem, then perhaps it needs “‘weakening.”’ We feel, however that
rather than weaken the system, the proposed innovation would
strengthen it in that it would alleviate much of the growing
doubt among students as to its unrealistic austerity. No one can
deny that there has been considerable criticism by students of
the present penalty—and this criticism may well reflect a basic
dissatisfaction in the system.

An argument that has been used to justify the present
penalty is that it “teaches a boy he can’t cheat his way through
life,” and brings about an essential improvement in a person’s
character. If this be the case, then why isn’t the violator given
the opportunity to prove that he can be “‘changed’’?

We should like to make one final point: according to the
sheet proposing the change, the present penalty was insti-
tuted only thirty years ago, while the Honor System had been
working perfectly well for nearly 100 years without it. This
indicates that expulsion is in no way an essential component of
the Washington and Lee Honor System and that the system
can operate quite successfully without it. 2s

On Party Ties

The Progressive Party was founded, allegedly, on the
principle that it would offer the best candidates from the party
for each office during the school year. The University Party
claims that it, too, works under this principle. We do not ques-
tion the sincerity of either party’s choices of major offices,
although it does seem that a rather select circle of fraternities
are continuing to dominate caucus decisions.

It could be argued that the new political system still con-
tains the old political dealing, but with a new suit of clothes.
We do not wish to do that at this time. What is of immediate
importance is not how the candidates were chosen, but what
they actually will do for the student if they are elected.

Many people do not realize that once a man is elected to be
a member of the Executive Committee, there is no way that his
opinions and the decisions of the EC can be checked by other
students. Policy decisions which concern the entire student
body are made by a dozen students who were elected once and
who either don’t have to worry about another election; or who
don’t have to worry about the rest of the student body knowing
what kind of job they are doing.

Because the EC has such absolute power, with no system of
checks and balances administered by other students, we feel
that party ties in themselves should not influence a student’s
vote in any way. Let us select our EC representatives and class
presidents for next year on the basis of their personal quali-
fications, their apparent sincerity, and the time they will have
to devote to the job for which they are running. The authority
which they gain is too great to allow it to be derived from
ancaleteaed votes aw. F.

The New ‘Gah

The culmination of months of careful photography, re-
writing, and preparation of new layouts was seen this week in
the release of the new University catalogue. Frank Parsons did
a highly commendable job on it. He faced many problems in
fashioning a catalogue so radically different from what has
been published in the past. They have been met with an in-
genuity and a competence that is very praiseworthy.

Parsons’ use of larger type in general, and a greater variety
of type, plus his imaginative use of pictures, produced for
Washington and Lee a catalogue which gives full justice to the
quality of the University. It will be a valuable tool for the Dean
of Admissions, and it is a source of pride to all those affiliated

By Feature Staff Writer

(Editor’s note—This is the third
in a series of articles to acquaint
the student body with the profes-
sors they see in class and around
the campus but never get to know.
One of the aims of a small col-
lege is to allow for closer contact
between the students and the fac-
ulty, and it is in the spirit of im-
proving this relationship that these
articles are offered.)

No one needs the picture to re-
mind them who Dr. Leyburn is. If
you have not had one of his courses,
you have heard about him, or at
least seen him somewhere.

But did you know that this grey-
haired, mannerly gentleman is the
author of four books; once taught
at Hollins; has lived in Haiti and
Africa; was once Dean of the Uni-
versity here; or that he is a con-
cert pianist?

Dr. Leyburn graduated from what
is now Duke University (formerly
Trinity College) in three years with
a degree in Economics. He was
eighteen when he graduated, and
stayed near to get his Master’s be-
fore going to Princeton. He received
his second Masters in Economics at
the age of twenty.

At this point he became an instruc-
tor at Hollins College. “I can still

Transition Or Tradition?

Dear Editor,

I am writing in regards to an
article by Bill Boardman that ap
peared in Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi.
Although by his own admission, Mr.
Boardman’s article didn’t say any-
thing, the tone of the article was
one that disturbed me greatly. His
article surely cannot reveal the real
attitude of someone of his intelli-
gence and position.

Of course Mr. Boardman’s per-
ception in noting W&L’s “period of
transition” must be commended, but
his fears of the entrance of “egg-
heads and liberals” cannot be gen-
uine. Surely he must realize that
eggheads—and yes,
are not really interested in destroy-
ing some of the “valued traditions”
of Washington and Lee, but rather
interested in looking at these values
in terms of their own merit rather
than merely accepting them because
they are old.

Again, it was hard to interpret just
what Mr. Boardman meant by

duet,” but I assume he meant a
degree of maturity as manifest in
interpersonal behavior. Here I need
only mention that
of W&L agree that the last few
years have seen a tremendous ma-
turation in the general student.
But the most unfortunate attitu-
tude expressed by Mr. Boardman
was that of tradition worship, Al-

“It is interesting that

many years,’ says Dr. Leyburn,
“for my family originally came from

to Durham, North Carolina. I went
to Trinity because it was the closest

Dear Mr. Hash,

Through an unfortunate misunderstanding, your name
was signed at the end of a facetious notice in last Friday’s
Ring-tum Phi. What happen is this:

A notice announcing the formation of the EC Food Com-
mittee was turned into me for proofing, In it, your name was
misspelled ‘ Milse’”” Hash, and I mistakenly took the notice for
a joke. As a reply of sorts, I wrote the tongue-in-cheek an-
nouncement about returning plates and signed it ““Milse Hash,”
a name that I regarded as purely fictitious. Later, someone cor-
rected the two notices, changing the name to “Mike Hash”
in both case, and it was in this form that these notices appeared
in the paper.

I greatly regret any embarrassment or inconvenience that
this mistake may have cost you.

At one time college men took their
drinking seriously, but today they
no longer drink to get drunk.

That’s the word from Dr. Byron
Atkinson, dean of students, and
Dr. A. T. Brugger, dean of men,
at the University of California, Los
Angeles.

The educators say the modern
student considers drinking a so-
cial grace.

Fraternity drunks are tolerated
but not admired. This fact is an
indication of the “growing maturity
of a more affluent middle class.”

A survey conducted by the deans
reveals:

The shift in how and why students
drink occurred in 1948. It has be-
come a firm social pattern, especially
among residents of urban colleges.

The drinking habits of today’s
college crop are more consistent
with a mature attitude toward life
and learning.

The deans believe present-day
students don’t drink out of self-
pity as their predecessors did. If
they are insecure or worried, they
find answers in evangelical move-
ments or psychotherapy rather
rather than the bottle.

Why do they drink? They im-
bibe for conviviality, relaxation, and
to remove inhibitions and not for
comfort, escape, or exhibitionism.

Students don’t consider themselves
“angry young men” or members of
the “beat generation.”

They are not revolting against
patterns valued by adults because
they value these same _ patterns

It is high time that something is

people say bring about integration

been denied for so long should not
be denied any longer. Integration
should be implemented immediately.
The gradual erasure of the real
deep-seated prejudices in the minds
and hearts of people will only come
when contact between the races is
established, by force of law if neces-
sary. This erasure is what has to
come and can only come gradually.
It will come eventually, however,
whether diehards like it or not. The
students and their government
should take the lead to bring about
integration of university and town
now.

Crothers Reviews Golf , Net Week;
Both Teams Hampered By Rains

In the past week the General's |
tennis team has had matehes with
George Washington University and

3ridgewater College, losing in both
outings to rainy weather.

Enough of the mateh with George
Washington was played to find the
Generals losing, 742-1!4 before the
rain stopped the first doubles match
with the set split, 4-6,6-1. The only
Washington and Lee victory came
when Captain John Baker downed
Jerry Reedy, 7-5, 6-4 in a singles
match.

At Bridgewater on April 30, the
Generals managed to overcome the
Eagles, 5-0, before the rain again
canceled the action. Washington and
Lee handily won the five singles
matches played and Howard Busse
was leading his match, 6-0, 3-1 when
play was stopped.

Jackets Beat B-Lacrossemen

By ROGER SENNOT

The W&L JV stickmen dropped a
close 4-2 decision to visiting Ran-
dolph-Macon Lacrosse Club yester-
day afternoon. In what could be de-
seribed as a defensive battle, R-M’s
goalie John Gerhardt collected sev-
enteen saves and found open men
with uncanny accuracy on clearing
plays. His fine defensive effort en-
abled the visiting stickmen to keep
the pressure on W&L’s two goalies,
“Dusty” Rhodes and “Butch” West,
who did a fine job for the Generals.

At the end of the first half, the
affair was deadlocked, 1-1. Mid-
fielder Harry Brooky fired a hard

shot past "Macon’s goalie in the first
period, and the visitors picked up a
goal in the second frame to even
up the contest. The Generals were
often a man short during the first
half due to numerous penalties.
With a one man and two man ad-

| vantage during the second period,

R-M deluged the home team’s goal
tender (Rhodes) with shots which
he handled well by saving or de-
flecting away from the nets.

In the third quarter, midfielder
Jamie Andrew of the junior Gen-
erals alertly scooped up a loose ball
in front of ’Macon’s goal and flipped
it in. This was the only score of the
third frame, giving the Generals a
2-1 lead going into the final period.
In the fourth quarter, R-M’s stick-
men rallied for three goals to wrap
up the contest, 4-2. "Macon scored
the go-ahead goal when they inter-
cepted a pass by West almost direct-

ly in front of the Generals’ goal;
and quickly converted it into the

decisive tally. W&L had an oppor-
tunity to even the battle when with
two minutes left they had a one
man advantage, but failed. The jun-
ior * Generals now have a 1-3 recor rd.

State Meet Title

By DON CASTO

Assistant Sports Editor

The General thinclads romped to
an easy victory last Monday
noon, scoring ninety-eight
in a triangular meet against Elon
and Carolina College. Elon
finished with twenty nine points and
East Carolina with thirty-eight.

Hurdler John Pearson and jump-
er Robin Kell led the cindermen in
their victory. Pearson tallied wins in
the high and intermediate hurdles,
running thehighs in 16.4 seconds and

The mile run was won by soph-
omore Andy Kilpatrick in a time of
four minutes, forty-two and a half
seconds with freshman distance run-
ner Lee Johnson running a close sec-
ond. Mac Brownlee turned in his
usual outstanding performance and
won the 880 yard run with a time
of two minutes, two and four tenths
seconds .

Henry Sackett and Tom Edwards*

captured first and second in the
broad jump. The winning jump was
twenty feet and five inches. Sackett,
who had just recovered from :
pulled muscle also placed second in
the triple jump. In other field events
Dave Munroe took second in the
shot put followed by Dan Manson.

Dave Britt placed second in the
discus throw, and Sam Pipes was
third. Sprinters Mark Owen and
Wayne Barnes captured  seeond
places in the 100 and 220 dashes
respectively.

Last Saturday the track team

placed second in a field of fifteen
in the Davidson Relays. They missed
first place by the narrow margin of
two points. Coach Lord promises a
first place next year. The sprint
medley relay, anchored by Mac
Brownlee, achieved first place laur-

Eight Intelligent W&L Adbetes,
Sigma Delta Psi Receive Laudits

By DAVID SHUFFLEBARGER

Now what’s all this phooey about
dumb athletes? One sometimes gets
that impression after seeing some
of the teams who come to the campus
for games, meets or matches, and
bring with them subsidized athletes.
In some cases, the image is one
well-deserved, for the academic
standards for athletes at many larger
schools are definitely quite low. But
here at W&L, which has the hardest
entrance requirements in Virginia,
there is no such thing as the dumb
athlete.

Granted in the pre-1954 era there
was much subsidization at W&L.
But after several football players
were caught cheating, the adminis-

I-M Softball Finals

By virtue of their 6-2 victory
over the PiKA’s, the Delts intra-
mural softball team earned the right
to host the SPE’s in the finals of
the I-M Softball playoffs today.

Each of the teams, Delts, SPE’s,
Kappa Sigs, and the PiKA’s won
their respective league titles, giving
them a berth in the playoffs. The
Delts are undefeated, having also
topped the Kappa Sigs. The SPE’s
beat the PiKA’s for the finals of the
round robin affair.

If the SPE’s should win today, one
more game would be necessary to
decide the championship. Head um-
pire Pit Burton has not yet sched-
uled the extra game.

I believe that Mr. Lamb is ignoring
the basic purpose of our Honor Sys-

of this year’s Executive Committee
and the following purpose was out-
lined to me It is generally agreed
that the purpose of our Honor Sys-

who breach our Honor System, but
instead its objective is to rid our
campus of these persons who can-
not live by the code of honor to
which they have consented by their
attendance at Washington and Lee.
With this basic purpose in mind,
the plan which Mr. Lamb outlines
sems to degeate the premise, upon
which our Honor System is based.

I feel that the Honor System must
not be weakened. As a member of

Mr. Lamb contends that since we

continue to turn our cheek to those
who commit honor violations. This
proposal can only lead to disrespect
for our Honor System. We must be
realistic. Would not some persons
take advantage of Mr. Lamb’s pro-
posal and as an end result ruin our
Honor System? Persons would find
themselves weighing the advantages
and disadvantages or breaching the

a breach were worth a suspension.
