DIVIDED OPINION SHOWN IN CUBA POLL

R. E. Lee Research Grants Are Announced

Program Termed As
‘Unique Opportunity

By JULIAN MARKHAM
Assistant Managing Editor
The Robert E. Lee Scholars and Research Assistants for
the current academic year were announced today by Dr. W.
W. Pusey, Dean of the College. Under the Robert E. Lee
Research Program for Undergraduates, the Scholars and Re-
search Assistants will receive grants-in-aid financed by an

alumnus for this purpose.

In its third year of operation, the Robert E. Lee Research

Program is being received with
students alike. This is due in part,*
Dean Pusey said, because of the
wide range of projects available in
the fields of science, language, the
humanities, and the social sciences.

Cited as one of the many “forward
looking aspects of Washington and
Lee,” Dean Pusey said that a pro-
gram of this type of research is
“quite rare on undergraduate cam-
puses” since it gives students the
opportunity to begin academic re-
search with mature scholars. “The
Robert E. Lee Research Program is
one of which Washington and Lee
is very proud.” The continuence of
this program is guaranteed by the
funds made available in the endow-
ment, Dean Pusey noted.

The Robert E. Lee Scholars and
Research Assistants and the pro-
fessors (in bold face type) under

Shots Urged

To Prevent

Flu Epidemic

The infirmary staff has announced
that freshmen and sophomores who
failed to get the free influenza shots
during the last two weeks will be
allowed to take them with those
taking them the next two weeks.
This change in policy came about
because the percentage of students
who had taken the shots was low.

The U.S. Public Health Service
has announced that there is a high
probability of an outbreak of Asian
flu this winter. This flu is highly
contagious and could cripple a stu-
dent body unless precautionary
shots are taken. The serum offered
is highly effective and there is lit-
tle chance of reaction to it.

Mrs. Agnor, the head nurse in
the infirmary, said that there would
be two nurses on duty every week
night from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. for the
next few weeks.

It is advisable to take these in-
jections as early as possible because
it will take three weeks for full
immunization, and the _ greatest
chance of epidemic will begin after
students return from Thanksgiving
vacation.

 

 

ZBT Aids United Fund
By Sponsoring Carwash

November 1, 2, and 3, between
2:00 and 6:00 p.m., a carwash for
the purpose of raising funds for
the United Fund Appeal will be

As a promotion for the opening
of Knick’s 66 at the old Esso sta-
tion next to the Coke bottling plant,
Mr. Knick has agreed to donate pro-
fits on the sale of gasoline. The
cost of the carwash is $1.50, and
these funds will also be donated to
the United Fund Appeal.

It is hoped that the student body
will support this worthwhile pro-

Troubs To Begin
New Fall Season
Next Wednesday

By C. C. FLIPPEN

Executive Editor

Shall the dogma of the ma-
jority rule man’s mind or shall
it be free to seek out truth on
its own?

This is the central theme of
the play, “Inherit the Wind,”
which will open next week at

the Troubadour Theatre.

The drama, based on the famous
Scopes’ monkey trial held early
this century, is not history; it is
rather a piece of theatre. It is a
drama of suspense which only takes
the incident of the monkey trial
as its basis.

Man’s Rights

“The play concerns the necessity
of a man being allowed to speak
what he believes,” Dr. Cecil Jones,
director of the play, said. “More
than this it envolves his right to
think, to ask questions—even about
subjects generally considered to be
beyond question.

“The matter of teaching evolu-
tion, simply the subject itself,
is not important here,” he said.
“But what is important is whether
a man has the right to think for
himself—whether he can weight
evidence and make up his mind, or
if he must blindly accept what
the majority believes.”

Actual history was envolved in
shaping the play slightly. The trial
itself has been rearranged and con-
densed.

Main Characters

The four main characters in the
original trial, Clarence Darrow, Wil-
liam Jennings Bryan, H. L. Menken,
and Scopes, find their counterparts
in the play. However, the fictional
characters, Henry Drummond, Mat-
thew Brady, E. K. Hornbeck, and
Cates, take only shadings of the his-
torical figures. All other characters
in the play were created for the
drama.

The play itself is in a sense, “one of
suspense,” Dr. Jones said. “Although
the outcome is known, as the play
progresses it is not quite so obvi-
ous as it may have seemed in the
beginning.

Suspenseful Drama
“Like any drama based on a trial,
its suspense mounts in the moving
from witness to witness,” said.

The leading roles in the play,
by Jerome Lawrence and Robert
E. Lee, are held by Tim Morton
as Drummond, Gay Reading as
Brady and John Dunnell as Horn-
beck.

The play will be presented Wed-
nesday-Saturday of the
Curtain time each performance
is 8:30 p.m.

ter of influence.

But its action the United States
has put before it an immediate pos-
sibility of complete destruction by
nuclear war. As far as determin-
ing future action it has already
been decided or will be by the Rus-
sians; we have already committed
ourselves. What remains to be done
is to find out what the people feel
about the crisis we have entered,
and the Ring-tum Phi has conse-
quently decided to poll a reaction of
the students and faculty at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Three Questions

1) There are rumors that Kennedy
precipitated this action for its vote-
getting possibilities. Is there any
truth to this?

2) Do you think that our action
stemmed more from our violated
rights in the matter or from being
confronted with a previously unex-
perienced situation?

3) Do you think there is a pos-
sibility of a limited war in Cuba
if an agreement is not reached?

Dr. Leon Sensabaugh, Professor of
History and an expert on Latin Ameri-
ca, offered the following answers:

On question one; “Although Ken-
nedy is a very able politician, I can’t
| quite see that he acted on these mo-
ties.”

On question two: “Self-protection
|is a fundamental right of any coun-
| try, and Kennedy acted on the basis of
national security. As long as actions
and weapons in Cuba were defensive
the Administration wasn’t too worried.
But when offensive weapons were built
the proximity of Cuba took on a new
aspect.”

On question three: “Yes (there is a
possibility); not necessarily a land
war, but naval action is quite possible.
(But) the only chance of limited land
action would be if Castro in some
way attacked us.

Mr. Futch, a new member of the fac-
ulty in the Department of History was
asked his opinion on the crisis. He stat-
ed in answer to question one:

“These rumors may very well have
some foundation in fact. Politicians
are politicians.”

On question two: “The circumstances
mentioned in Question three, as well
as Pentagon pressure on the White
House, seems the likeliest explanation
for the U.S. action on Cuba.”

Dave Montgomery, a senior Delta
Tau Delta, enthusiastically offered his
opinion.

“Although this was a convenient
time for JFK to come out with his
position, I think he has more integrity
than to put the USS. in a crisis position
for political reasons. Anyway, if the

blockade fails, he has cut his own
neck in 64.”

His answer to question two: “Our
action stemmed from our violated

rights when it became clear that Rus-
| sia wasn’t willing to listen to words
and correct the situation.”

 

In response to question three: “No,
1 think there will either be an all-out
|nuclear war or a continuation of the
| cold war— nothing in between.”

Jim Haley, a junior
tive in the

and quite ac-
Conservative Society,
|emphatically voiced his beliefs on
| the present situation by saying in
answer to question one: “(this is)
| absolutely true! It was known in
Congress and among the military

A Greeting To Parents

This weekend promises to be a busy one with more than
1,000 parents planning to attend the Eighth Annual Parents’
Weekend. Activities are planned for all day Friday and Satur-
day, all of which will give the parents a better idea of the school

and its activities.

The Office of University Relations and Dr. John Wise,
chairman of the Parents’ Weekend Committee, have done a
fine job in making the arrangements and planning the well-
rounded program of events. The response of the parents to
the weekend proves their interest in the school and its objec-
tives. Each year the number of interested parents multiplies and
perhaps in future years full attendance will become a reality.

We welcome all of the parents to Washington and Lee this
weekend and hope they have an interesting and pleasant time.

 

Cuban Crisis Creates

New Look

By HARRY MEEM
Friday Reporter

As this is written, the United
States quarantine of Cuba is slightly
over three days old. Our naval
vessels have permitted one Soviet
tanker to pass on the captain’s as-
surances that he had only petro-
leum for cargo, one freighter has
been stopped and is being inspected,
and a report from Washington indi-
cates that another Soviet ship has
been allowed to proceed. And the
world is still here.

The United Nations is in a flurry
of activity, in an attempt to prevent
war. Peace offers are flying thick
and fast, with Acting Secretary-
General U Thant trying to establish
negotiations in an attempt to re-
solve the crisis.

President Kennedy made a tough
speech to the Nation Monday night,
and it was necessary that he do
so. The Communist “salami” tactic,
of taking a bit of territory at a
time, could not have reigned un-
checked forever, without eventually
undermining all the United States
stands for. The President had to
prove that the United States is not
afraid to fight, that it can and will
take stern measures to prevent the
spread of Soviet conquest.

The first Soviet reply was filled
with the sort of propaganda to
which we are by now well accus-
tomed. Words are cheap, and the
Soviet Union used them in abun-
dance. Some of them are almost
funny in light of Soviet actions
in the past.

One passage from Khrushchev’s
reply to Britain’s Lord Russell, who
appealed to both heads of state to
call off their actions, seems espe-
cially ludicrous. Premier Khrushchev
wrote: “It is well known that if one
tries to mollify a robber by giv-
ing him first one’s purse, then one’s
coat, etc., the robber will not be-
come more merciful, will not stop
robbing. On the contrary, he will
become increasingly insolent. There-
fore, it is necessary to curb the
highway man....” Mr. Khrushchev
may have meant his words to apply
to the United States, but they are a
perfect description of Soviet actions
in the past, and the present U. 5.
positions.

Now Mr. Khushchev is trying to

Debate Stress
Now On Frosh

Mr. William W. Chaffin, director of
forensics, has announced that for
the next three weeks there will be
an emphasis on freshman debating
while the varsity takes a short rest.

After practice debates during the
week, Mr. Chaffin and both a nega-
tive and affirmative team will set
out on Friday for Wake Forest.
They will debate there against an-
other frosh team. The following
weekend, Nov. 8-11, two completely
different freshmen teams will travel
with Mr. Chaffin for a similar round
at the University of South Carolina.
During this time the varsity will
be preparing for the Tau Kappa
Alpha debating tournament to be
held here the weekend of the 16th-
18th.

After Thanksgiving there are pos-
sibilities of debates at Temple Col-
lege, N.C.U., and New York City.
Mr. Chaffin is optimistic about the
varsity teams’ chances in these
meets.

Freshmen are reminded that there
will be a mock debate similar to
that at freshman camp for parents

 

Friday at 8 pm. in the duPont
lecture room. The topic is—Resolved:
the South should have won the

Civil War.

 

At World

appear magnanimous by offering to
hold up shipping to Cuba for the
three weeks asked by U Thant. Our
reply, that the blockade stays, may
seem to put us in a bad light. To
some nations abroad, it will seem
we are bent on a path of aggression
and have no wish to stop, no matter
what our opponents do.

Our main purpose in establishing
the quarantine was not to strangle
Cuba, but to force the removal of
the missile sites already established
there and prevent their being re-
established.

If Mr. Khrushchev wants peace,
this is what he should offer, not
merely to suspend shipping and go
into negotiations.

Mr. Khrushchev seems to be run-
ning somewhat scared already. He
has diverted some of the ships
bound for Cuba, and jumped for
negotiations as quickly as they were
offered.

The Soviet Union has no vital in-
terests in Cuba, and would find it
difficult to supply in case of war,
lying as it does 4,000 miles from
Russia. The Soviet Union must have
some clear-headed men who can
see that the risk of war merely to
maintain an irritant in the Western
Hemisphere is not worth it.

Both sides now have agreed to

preliminary talks. Both sides need aj @

way to back down from the threat
of a nuclear war without losing
face. And it is almost certain to be

nuclear, no matter what the pro-| =

testations from the two powers.

We are now, and will for some
time be, in a position of watching
and waiting, while the powers ne-
gotiate. This is all we can do, wait
and hope. We have had to do this
in the past, with no assurance that
the talking going on was going to
lead to anything. With the show of
force by the United States, it at
least seems likely this time that
some definite action will be taken.

Mr. James Boatwright, Washing-
ton and Lee instructor of English,
returned Wednesday from the first
National Poetry Festival in Wash-
ington, D.C., at the Library of
Congress.

Many of our major poets were
present as speakers, chairmen of
discussion groups, and as readers of
their own poetry. The festival was
in line with the present administra-
tion’s patronage of the arts. It also
commemorated what Mr. Boawright
calls “the most important event in
American poetry—the founding of
Poetry magazine.” He adds, “Look-
ing back over the last fifty years,
we can see the tremendous effect of
Poetry, which has published most
of our major poets before they be-
came famous.”

Theme

The theme of the event was “Fifty
Years of American Poetry.” In line
with this, the program included,
besides the 35 or so outstanding
poets present, many other writers—
mainly poets who have recorded
their works on tape for the Library
of Congress—and other individuals
who have contributed to the de-
velopment of poetic expression in
this country.

Topics

Topies included: “The Role of the
Poetry Journal,” “Fifty Years of
American Poetry,” “The Poet and
the Public,’ and “The Problem of
Form.” The age of the poets varied
from thirty to that of Robert Frost,
with poets such as John Crowe

Ransom, Karl Shapiro, Mark Van
Doren, Robert Penn Warren, Ken-
neth Rexroth, Richard Eberhart,
Henry Rago, Louis Untermeyer, and
others being present. The Beat poets
were not represented; Mr. Boat-
wright did not know whether this
was due to their not being asked or
their refusal to come.

Festival

Although this the first Festival
devoted to poetry that the Library
of Congress has held, The Library
has held 12 such festivals for cam-
ber music since 1925 and has been
the scene of many individual poetry
and literary programs in the last
quarter century.

The proceedings of the sessions
have been recorded and will be
published by the Library in book
form during 1963. The festival was
the first ever to be sponsored by
an agency of the United States
Government. It was financed by a
grant of funds from the Bollongen
Foundation of New York City.

Mr. Boatwright, who left Sunday
to attend the frstival as Editor of
Shenandoah, thought the spirit of

‘Southern Conservative’ Aims
At States’ Rights, Lower Debt

The Conservative Society, which
has many supporters in the ranks
of southern conservative Democrats,
is a student organization widespread
throughout this country. The main
arm of the Conservative Society of
W&L is its monthly paper, the
Southern Conservative. After suc-
cessful operations last year, under
the leadership of Bob Sykes, the
Southern Conservative plans to ex-
pand.

The basie policy of the organiza-
tion is to further knowledge and be-
lief in the basic Conservative Doc-
trine through intense, deliberate, and
academic articles. Recognizing ex-
tremes on either left or right is
potentially dangerous. The South-
ern Conservative follows the policy
of recognizing only rational argu-
ments.

The organization has some basic
ideas pertinent to an understanding
of their Doctrine. They believe in
the preservation of a republican
federal system of government func-
tioning on the basis of the separa-
tion of powers concept, as set up by
the Constitution of the United States.
They advocate a more positive for-
eign policy aimed at ultimate vic-
tory rather than mere containment.
They see the necessity of curtailing
the billowing power of the federal
government. They believe that an
end should be put to government
deficit spending which inflates the
value of the dollar.

Along with this they would like

to see a tempering of the welfare of
state concept in order to maintain
individualism and incentive among
the American people. They declare
above all that faith must be instilled
in Americans in those principles and
concepts which were so dear to our
forefathers and for which a count-
less number of Americans sacrificed
their lives.

With these broad principles in
mind the Southern Conservative will
comment upon contemporary events
and actions as well as expounding
upon the social, economic, and phil-
osophic bases of Conservatism. The
Conservative Society plans to dis-
cuss this thoroughly by having guest
columns from such leading expon-
ents of Conservatism as Representa-

paper is to link Conservative So-
cieties within the South. Communi-
cations have already been set up
with Davidson, Sweet Briar, Ran-
dolph-Macon, as well as UVa., Wil-
liam and Mary, and Hampden-
Sydney. A column has been and
will continue to be devoted to the
Conservative Societies of other cam-
puses .

Conservatives feel that Conser-
vatism is a greatly growing force
particularly among college students
in the United States, and their ef-
fect will be heard in the future in
response to a past generation of
extremely liberal government.

This year there will be a nominal
fee charged for the paper. This will
not include students, to whom dis-

 

the event was summed up by Stan-
ley Kunitz, one of the opening
speakers. “Kunitz sees the Poet as
the representative free man of our
time. While other men work in
gangs and packs, and produce in
bits and pieces, the writer—especially
the Poet— has his freedom.”
Commenting on the festival it-
self, Boatwright added: “It is a re-

By BOB HART
Friday Columnist

Since the present senior class en-
tered Washington and Lee in 1959,
many _ significant
changes have
taken place which
have _ influenced
all phases of stu-
dent activity.
These changes
have been initia-
ted by both the
students and the
faculty, and have
provided a _ pro-
gressive and im-
proving trend for

 

Hart

this university.

The class of ’63 was the first class
to eat in the Commons. This was
one of the biggest changes the fra-
ternity system had faced in many
years. Not having the freshmen eat-
ing at the houses proved at first to
be a financial problem and a prob-
lem of assimilation of the freshmen
into the fraternity. These problems,
however, seem to have been over-
come, and this change is apparently
proving successful.

Changes in student government
include an increase of importance of
the IFC and the newly formed Stu-
dent Control Committee. The IFC
has indeed changed in its import-
ance on campus. Faculty action has
necessitated the IFC’s realization of
its capabilities not as an opposing
force to changes instigated by the
faculty, but as a means of coordina-
tion so that these changes might
prove successful for all concerned.
The formation of the Student Con-
trol Committee has placed new au-
thority in the hands of the students,
and this committee thus far has
proved quite successful. Its disci-
plinary actions have gained it the
respect of the student body, and as
a result it seems to have lessened
misconduct on the part of the stu-
dents.

The recent action of the faculty
on combo parties during university
dance functions will undoubtedly
increase attendance at the dances
and concerts. Yet the present in-
crease in the sale of dance plans
is not attributable to this action.
Improved and more active dance
board leadership and a more popular
entertainment program have caused
a tremendous increase in the sale
of dance plans since 1959. This type
of change in social life is a good one
for the university as a whole, and
those responsible are to be con-
gratulated.

Improved Facilities

The improved dormitory facilities,
the new science building and re-
modeling of Howe Hall, and the
renovation of Lee Chapel are all
physical changes which have great-
ly improved the appearance and
usefulness of our campus. The most
traditional-minded students and
alumni may perhaps be a little hes-
itant to approve a type of expansion
at W&L, yet this most recent ex-
pansion was very much needed, and
is one that all students and alumni
should be proud of.

With this idea of change being
so prevalent on our campus, I
think it particularly important that
the students not forget the many

 

Four Year’s Of Change
Is Witnessed By Sentors

when we consider change in stu-
dent life at Washington and Lee.

Since our freshman year (1959-
1960), there seems to have been a
decline in observance of some of
our traditions. The speaking tradi-
tion, particularly, seems to have lost
its significance. I think every stu-
dent needs to be reminded that we
do observe such a tradition, and it
is this tradition, along with con-
ventional dress, the freshman beanie,
and the honor system, that we can-
not change and still expect W&L to
remain the fine university that it
is.

Change, then, in student govern-
ment, social life, and physical fa-
cilities is fine for a progressive uni-
versity. But as a word of caution,
let's not be so anxious for change
that we forget those things which
make our University what it is today.

UCA Expands

F&M To Meet Varsity; Frosh Win

Generals To Rally
In Quest Of Third

Winning Season

Washington and Lee goes after
a winning season Saturday when
the Generals play host to a Frank-
lin and Marshall eleven that is still
looking for its first win of the year.

The Generals, now 4-1 for the sea-
son, need one more victory to as-
sure themselves of a better than
.500 season for the third consecu-
tive year. They were unbeaten in
1960 and 1961, after turning in a
3-4-1 season in 1959.

On hand for Saturday’s contest
will be some 1,000 parents of Wash-
ington and Lee students, attending

the University’s eighth annual Par-

ents’ Weekend.

Potentially Dangerous

Despite the Diplomats’ unimpres-
sive 0-4 record, Coach Lee Mc-
Laughlin rates F&M as a potentially
dangerous opponent. He says the
Dips are “a lot stronger” than last
season when the Generals won at
Lancaster, Pa., 40-0. “They certainly
have more speed than last year, but
they lack depth,” he adds.

Top offensive threat for F&M is
halfback Mike Reese, a former
quarterback for the Diplomats. For
that matter, all of F&M’s starting
backs are former quarterbacks, a
big shift by Coach Woody Sponaugle
which is designed to put more punch
in an offense that netted only 35
points in 1961.

Big F&M Line

The biggest worry for the Gen-
erals is the beefy Diplomat forward
wall. Says McLaughlin, “We didn’t
run against that line last year, and
we won't be able to go through it
this time. We’re going to have to
brush up on our pass patterns and
work on our outside game.”

Franklin and Marshall and the
Generals have shared one mutual
opponent. The Dips lost to Johns
Hopkins by a 28-7 score, while
the Generals shot down the Blue
Jays Saturday by a 22-8 count.

McLaughlin was pleased with the
Generals’ win, but he allowed as
how “it wasn’t a really overall con-
sistent effort.”

“Hopkins certainly didn’t quit on
us at any time, and they could
have,” he said. “They deserve a lot
of credit.”

McLaughlin Praises

McLaughlin passed out praise for
the “big boys” of the W&L line—
blue team tackles Bobby Payne and
Jimmy Sylvester and red unit line-
backer Dan Flournoy—for their
fine play against Johns Hopkins.
Fullback Tommy Keesee played his
usual “steady game,” said Mc-

Laughlin. He singled out sophomore |

Football Tvi-Captain Bob Payne

Named Athlete Of The Week

Senior tackle Bob Payne has been
cited as “athlete of the week” by
the Washington and Lee coaching
staff for his outstanding play against
Johns Hopkins.

Payne displayed exceptional of-
fensive in the first half
of the contest
with the Blue
Jays, putting forth
what the coaches
called a “100 per
fe cent effort’ in
carrying out his
blocking assign-
ments.

In_ the
half Bob showed
the Homecoming
crowd one of the
best defensive

prowess

second

 

 

performances of the season. Coach
Mac mentioned that in viewing films
of the game, it became obvious that
Payne’s defensive work was out-
standing and vital to the Generals’
victory.

McLaughlin also noted that on a
pre-game written test of scouting
reports, Bob scored a 98 to lead
the team, displaying his knowledge
of the opposition’s moves. Mc-
Laughlin cited this as another ex-
ample of Payne’s conscientiousness
toward football this season.

Bob has proved himself a fine
leader throughout the season, and
has done a highly creditable job
as tri-captain in helping lead the
Generals to their current 4-1 rec-
ord.

Dr. Phillips well-known professor

was asked his opinion on the Cuban
crisis.

In reply to question two: “My im-
pression is that most Americans
would have favored earlier action
than Kennedy took, but basically
the president’s move was based on
the nature of weapons installed in
Cuba being changed to offensive.
His move was primarily motivated
by our national security, not the
uniqueness of the situation.
