Dr. Wheeler
Turns In
Resignation

Will Continue To Write

By SHANNON JUNG

Dr. J. Harvey Wheeler, co-author
of Fail-Safe and W&L professor of
political science, has indicated that
he does not plan to return to his
teaching position this September.

In a letter to Dr. Lewis W. Adams,
Dean of the School of Commerce
and Administration, Wheeler wrote,
“It would not be fair to anyone for
me to try and live half in the world
of W&L and half in the world of
research and writing.”

Hollywood Buys ‘Fail-Safe’

Wheeler has been on leave from
the Department of Political Science
to work for the Fund of the Re-
public at the Center of Study of
Democratic Institutions at Santa
Barbara, California. Wheeler’s leave
of absence, which expires this fall,
began in the fall of 1961.

Fail-Safe, his best-seller novel
about accidental nuclear war whose
movie rights have been sold to a
Hollywood company, is the result of
a collaboration between Wheeler
and Eugene Burdick, co-author of
The Ugly American,

Writing Will Be Career

Wheeler stated that he wants to
continue writing for some time. He
went on to say that he could not
face a return to a full teaching
schedule, and especially not a six-
day schedule, in addition to his writ-
ing projects. Wheeler was to be pro-
fessor of two new political science
courses beginning this fall.

At this point, he is finishing a
manuscript on War and Politics and
another one on Participational De-
mocracy. He mentioned the possi-
bility of contracting for a possible
second novel. He will continue in his
capacity as consultant for the Center
and on the consultant staff for the
Encyclopedia Britannica.

‘Shenandoah’
To Feature
Cunningham

The first issue of Shenandoah
in 1963, which will be published

 

later this month, will feature a lec-
ture on “The Problem of Form” de-
livered by J. V. Cunningham at
the National Poetry Festival last fall,
editor James Boatwright has an-
nounced.

The new issue will also contain
poetry by James Dickey and fiction
by Anthony Ostroff. There will be
two book reviews and several ar-
ticles.

It will be the second issue of
Shenandoah during this semester.
The first issue featured one of
E. E. Cummings’ last poems. Boat-
wright said that he now plans to
make part of his spring issue a
tribute to John Crowe Ransom on
the poet’s 75th birthday. He is not
sure of all his contributors as yet,
but says he has promises from Allen
Tate, Cleanth Brooks, and Howard
Nemerov so far.

The forthcoming Shenandoah will
include: “The Problem of Form,” by
J. V. Cunningham, poet, critic, pro-
fessor at Brandeis; a lecture de-
livered at the National Poetry Fes-
tival, Library of Congress, October
24, 1952.

An article on Lowell’s poetry by
O. B. Hardison, Jr., poet and pro-
fessor of English at the University
of North Carolina. (Robert Lowell
was one of three poets to appear
in W&L’s Glasgow Series of lectures
this year.)

“Repertory Theatre: Paris” a
chronicle by Quentin Hope, Univer-
sity of Indiana, working in France
on a Fulbright grant. He is doing
a study of Moliere.

“The Desperate Heart,” a short
story by Anthony Ostroff, a poet. His
first volume, Imperatives, was pub-
lished last year. He has also had
fiction in Harper's.

“Pact,” a short story by Vassar
Miller. A Texan and a poet, this is
her first published story.

Poetry: poems by Guy Cardwell,
Paxton Davis, D. E. Mayers, Barry
Targan, and James Dickey.

Reviews: Henry Terrie of Dart-
mouth reviewing the Leon Edel bio-
graphy of Henry James; John Major
of the University of Colorado re-
viewing Geoffrey Bullough’s Mir-
ror of Minds: a study of psychology
and poetry.

Art work for the magazine will
be by Mrs. L. R. Emmons.

Washington and Lee is now in
the process of reclassifying and cata-
louging its collection of about 164
paintings, according to the univer-
sity treasurer E. S. Mattingly.

Mattingly said this morning that
the already sizeable insurance on
the paintings would probably be in-
creased as a result of the work of a

Shell Oil Gives $1,000 To Washington And Lee

Washington and Lee has been chosen by the Shell Oil Co. to share
in its program of “Shell Assists” to higher education for the fourth con-
secutive year.

Receipt of the Shell gift of $1,500 was announced yesterday by univer-
sity President Fred C. Cole. The money includes $500 of unrestricted
funds, $500 for general faculty development and $500 for professional de-
velopment of individual faculty members in chemistry, physics and math-
ematics.

 

Morris Appointed Missionary To Africa

Malcolm Morris, SPE sophomore from Richmond, has received an
appointment as a summer missionary to East Africa. He was given the
position after interviews in Richmond last weekend. Morris will be sent
to Africa by the Virginia Baptist Student Union, which finances a program
of summer missions every summer.

One of 14 students to be chosen this year, Morris will probably be
sent to Kenya. He will work much of the time in recreational camps, and
Bible schools. Other students will go to Europe, the Caribbean, or remain
in the United States.

Changes in Registration Resulting From Failure

The office of the Dean of the College has announced that if a student
learns of his failure in a course, he must go to his faculty adviser as soon
as possible beginning February 4, 1963, if the failure is going to make
necessary a change in second semester registration. The Dean of the Com-
merce School serves as advisor for all students in commerce or majoring
in economies or political science.

No change in registration will be made before February 4. Any change,
other than those involving failures, will be made in accordance with pro-
visions of the university catalogue, page 87.

National Defense Graduate Fellowship Information

Under the National Defense Graduate Fellowship program seniors
graduating in June 1963 may apply for a three-year award, with stipends
increasing from $2,000 to 2,400 a year, together with an allowance for de-
pendents. The students must be intending to enroll in a full-time course
of study leading to the Ph.D. or similar degree.

Applications are made directly to the graduate schools offering ap-
proved programs.

The fields of study include English, linguistics, modern languages, phil-
osophy, psychology, business administration, economics, geography, history,
political science, sociology and anthropology, and mathematics and the
natural sciences. Further information is available in the office of the Dean
of the College.

committee now studying the subject.
He also said that many of the works
will be relocated. At present the
best-known of the paintings, which
normally hang in Lee Chapel, are
on display in the lobby of McCorm-
ick Library.

Some of the university’s paintings
are among America’s greatest art
treasurers. Easily the most famous
of these are those of the collection
of the Lee family which were passed
on to Washington and Lee by Gen-
eral George Washington Custis Lee,
son of Robert E. Lee and president
of the university from 1871 to 1896.

Among the Lee collection are the
famous paintings by Charles Wilson
Peale of George Washington and
General LaFayette. The painting of
Washington is valued at over $250,-
000 and is one of the first portraits
made of him. Washington was 39
years old and an officer in the
British army at the time of the
portrait (he wears a British uni-
form). Peal’s portrait of LaFayette is
also of great value.

Other paintings from the Lee col-
lection include a Gilbert Stuart por-
trait of Washington and three por-
traits of the John Parke Curtis
family by John Wallaston.

 

Freshman Discontent Rumor False;
Less Than 10 Plan Actual Transfer

Texas Boys Make Up Over Half
Of Total Considering Transfer

By Roger Paine
Tuesday Managing Editor

A recent widely-spread rumor that a large number of stu-

dents in the freshman class are

contemplating transfer to an-

other school was investigated yesterday. It was proved false.
Of a freshman class numbering around 330, only seventeen

students have applied for transfer.*
Eight of these are citizens of the
state of Texas, to which they now
wish to return. Of the remaining
nine, only five are presently dis-
pleased with W&L as an educational
institution, and not all of these are
definitely leaving.

The secretary to the Registrar
stated that “under ten students” had
asked her to mail their transcripts
to another school for consideration.
The majority of those she cited
were Texas boys, who are not neces-
sarily discontented with W&L—they
just want to return to the Lone Star
State.

The Grass Is Greener

There is probably not a freshman
in any school in the country who
has not once thought to himself:
“The grass is greener on the other
side of the mountains.” But most
freshmen get over their disillusion-
ment with college life. Several mem-
bers of this year’s freshman class,
however, have some very apt criti-
cisms of W&L.

The major criticism is on intellec-
tual grounds—W&L is, to some, a
school in which the academic is
placed above the genuinely intellec-
tual. An example cited was one
course which placed too much em-
phasis on an infinite number of de-
tails, without covering the larger
and more lasting problems which
some freshmen feel this particular
course should teach.

A State of Change

Discontent seems to center around
the present state of change in which
W&L is deeply involved. Some
unusually perceptive freshmen have
noted this change and have recog-
nized in some ways its total scope.
They said that the school seems to
be moving from its social reputation
which existed five or six years
ago to a decidedly more academic
atmosphere.

 

In five more years, they feel, the
intellectual current will be of the
sort which may allow a looser cut
system and a more liberalized sys-
tem of education. These freshmen
are first to admit that these liberal-
izing changes are taking place right
now. Placement tests are offered to)
freshmen which grant the brighter |
students a chance to move into sec-|
ond-semester freshman courses and |
sophomore courses right away.

 

Change ‘Too Slow’

But as one freshman put it, “I
don’t want to read in my Alumni
Journal about how Washington and|
Lee is completing its steps to liber- |
alize education and how it is elimi-|
nating the cut system.” Most of these
freshman are simply not willing to

Stick around while W&L is under-

| spective,

going a period of change which ap-
to students to be

pears most a
very marked change.
Professors who teach freshmen

courses were severely criticized for
failing to give their classes credit for
being intelligent. “Because one fresh-
man in a class may not take his
work seriously, others are assumed
to have the same lack of sincerity
about their studies,” said one fresh-
man.
Intelligent Freshmen

It must be noted that although a
few of these views may not be in the
proper perspective or may not be
completely sound judgments, they
are nevertheless the feelings of some
of the most intelligent members of
the freshman class. For this reason
they should not be shrugged off by
anyone.

Members of the administration are
well aware of everything which has
been said above. They point out that
in any freshman class which is as
highly selective as ours, there are a
large number of students with a
very high potential. From this it
follows that there are many intro-
verts as well as extroverts. Where
the extrovert will live his life from
day to day, involving himself in the
life and institutions of his school,
the introvert may be asking him-
self some soul-searching questions.
Typical examples of this introspec-
tion would be: “Where am I going
and what am I doing and is this the
best place for me to accomplish what
I have set out to do?”

The upshot of this thinking and
worrying is what happened at Har-
vard last year: there were a phe-
nomenal number of students who
dropped out. This was the result of
a highly intelligent and introspec-
tive freshman class. Many of them,
like students here, were very good
in their secondary schools, and when
they went to Harvard, like students
who come here, they were frustrated
in the discovery that the same ap-
plication that they had used in
secondary school did not put them
in the same state of academic pre-
ferment to which they had become
accustomed.

The universal phenomenon of
freshman discontent visits W&L in
one form or another every year, and
it may appear to be increasing. It

| is only because W&L has enrolled in

each successive year a greater per-
centage of truly thoughtful, intro-
and often brilliant stu-
dents. It is their natural inclination
to examine their situation and to
wonder if it is the best for them or
not. It is a tribute to our college
that only a very few of these valu-
able students actually do leave.

Preserve Our College Personality

The January issue of The Satur-
day Review of Literature contains
an article entitled “What Makes a
College Distinctive?” It is written
by Edward D. Eddy, Jr., president
of Chatham College in Pittsburgh.
Eddy’s comments merit the attention
of faculty and students alike, for
they correspond very closely to the
criticisms directed at W&L by the
freshmen interviewed yesterday in
connection with the lead story today.

Eddy’s article deals with self-
realization, and it points out that
too many colleges, in their race for

the top rung on the academic ladder, |

have sacrificed their own personality
and individuality.
Students Today Are Eager
“The college that truly wants to
be itself will find it imperative...
to do more than merely choose what
type of student is prefers to enroll,”

 

said Eddy. He went on to enumerate
these. He pointed out that “it is no
longer necessary to force the Amer-
ican student to hit the books or to
get the idea. Today’s student has
been scared into eagerness by the

admissions hysteria.”
Students today have more crea-
tive minds than ever before. Col-

leges must be sure that this crea-
tivity is not “suffocated by inade-
quate provisions for the pursuit of
special interests.” Many freshmen at
W&L feel that there should be
more discusion clubs along the lines
of the Liberty Hall Society, which
allow free intellectual discussion be- |
tween professors and students. They |
feel that the “busy work” demanded |
in so many courses severely limit
one’s opportunity to look for the}
more important elements of educa- |
tion. |

 

Eddy also noted that today’s stu-
dent wants to put meaning into what
he learns. He is not satisfied with
a lot of trivial detail. “The colleges
do him (the student) an injustice
in not providing manifold opportuni-
ties for delving, deliberating, and
finally determining.”

This search for meaning extends
even further, and was a basic ele-
ment of yesterday’s discussion with
several freshmen. The student today
wants to “dig into the rationale for
decision-making in the 1960's.”

The entire article as published
The Saturday Review is too
long to summarize here. For the
sake of progress and a deeper un-
derstanding of a proper intellect-
ual atmosphere, we recommend
this article to everyone at W&L,
and hope that all will take the
responsibility to read it.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday Edition
Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

We Apologize
Publication of the Ring-tum Phi is quite often a haphazard
affair—deadlines are tight, copy is usually scarce, and staff
members quite often have other commitments (getting an edu-

cation, for example). As a result, mistakes are often made.
The article in the Friday edition which attacked Coach Mc-

Henry was just such a mistake.

The article was in poor taste, to begin with. It was a person-
al diatribe, with no reference to facts. It was purely the writer’s
opinion and had no place in a legitimate news story: opinions
belong in columns, not in unsigned sports copy. To top it off,

the article was poorly written.

The editors of the Ring-tum Phi do not consider varsity

athletics to be above criticism,

but criticism should be con-

structive, objective, and, above all, handled with tact. Last
Friday’s article violated these principles—for this mistake
and others like it the editors accept full responsibility.

To whom it may concern: we apologize.

On ‘American Hospitality’

A lot has been said lately about our exchange students, and
each fall we officially welcome them with open arms. The Ring-
tum Phi usually runs an article or a series of articles on the stu-
dents themselves, and everyone generally prides himself on his

American hospitality.

However, when the matter of personal contact with these
foreign students arises, there appears to be a shameful di-

chotomy between what we say
vately.

publicly and what we do pri-

We have noted that in several fraternity houses, when
the foreign exchange students are eating there, little or no

attention is paid them.

Surely we don’t ask that they be treated like freshmen dur-
ing Rush Week; however, common courtesy and friendliness
seem definitely to be in order. The real impressions that foreign
students get of America are not those they read about in the
Ring-tum Phi, but the results of their personal contacts with

Americans.

It seems to us that a little effort should be made towards
making these guests—of our country and of our fraternity
houses—feel a little more at ease. To date, there hasn’t been
much of this effort expended. And we wonder just what kind
of impression the foreign exchange students with us now have
developed so far of American hospitality.

Reader Questions Proposal

Dear Editor,

Several weeks before Christmas
I recall the Ring-tum Phi making a
suggestion as to professors not re-
quiring class attendance the week
prior to examinations. If I remem-
ber correctly, the paper’s proposal
included remarks about no quizzes
or papers being due at this time,
roll not being taken, etc.

Shortly after that, the faculty
took some kind of action on the
proposal. What they did exactly I’m
not sure, but it involved some kind
of nominal agreement with the sug-
gestions that appeared in the paper’s
editorial.

And evidently, that’s as far as it
went. I myself have two quizzes
and a paper this week, and none of
my professors have said a word
about not recording absences. As
far as I can gather, other students
are in the same boat I’m in.

Whatever became of this idea?
Most of the people to whom I have
talked thought it was a good one—

and many of these people included

professors. But, as usual, the Ring-

tum Phi has failed to follow up on
something that it starts. And (also,

think would be a good thing.

A READER

Players Defend McHenry

To the Editor:

We have been told by a member

of the Ring-tum Phi staff that Tom

Day, a freshman, was responsible
for the article in the Friday edition
which attacked basketball coach Bob

McHenry.

We should like to inquire what
personal experience Freshman Tom
Day has acquired in his five months
at Washington and Lee which en-
ables him to editorialize as he did

on the sports page of Friday’s Ring-

tum Phi?
Freshman Day covered both the

Hampden-Sydney and Lynchburg

games for the Ring-tum Phi. In his

account of the Lynchburg game he

never hesitates to place the blame
for the defeat on the shoulders of

Coach McHenry. Yet in his report
on the Hampden-Sydney game, he
praises the individual players, but in

no instance does he see the real rea-

son for the win: Coach McHenry’s
defensive strategy.

After playing four consecutive sea-

sons under Coach McHenry, we feel,
as members of the team, justified to
criticize Day,

first for his major
misconceptions about Coach Mc-
Henry and secondly for his preten-
tious “cuteness” in editorializing
basketball games.

Far from the great potential that
Day writes of, Coach McHenry has
had to console himself with a severe
lack of height, unfortunate injuries
and untimely “flunk-outs.” Again, as
members of the team, we feel that
Coach McHenry has obtained maxi-
mum results with what individuals
he has had to work with.

Certainly Freshman Day,
casual observer of two months’
basketball, cannot find himself in
the position to facetiously criticize
that which he knows no more about
than he does.

Again, speaking for the basketball
team, we underline the fact that the
team wholeheartedly supports the
work done by Coach McHenry.

‘Madison Blasts ‘Thieves’

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

There are low-rent tricks and then
there are low-rent tricks. But to me
there is none more low-rent than
stealing notebooks.

Every semester around exam time
there always occurs a rash of note-
book stealing. It’s a darn shame that
there are people in this school who
either take no notes or take notes
so poorly that they must resort to
taking someone else’s notebook.
These acts are not only a reflection
on these men’s character, but they
make it very hard on the owner of
the notes who has spent many hours
in class to get them.

I have heard that there are schools
where the competition is very tough
and the determination to make good
grades drives students to lie, cheat,
and steal to achieve their goals. And
as an example, it has been said that
in some schools when the teacher
mentions an article in a magazine
for the students to read, there is a
mad dash for the library. The first
man to read the article memorizes
it and then tears it out of the maga-
zine and burns it, hoping all along
he will be the only one in his class
with the knowledge of that article.

Neither the competition nor the
tactics here have yet reached that
stage, and I doubt if they ever will.
However, there is in this school a
small number of men who have no
scruples and who care nothing about
anyone but themselves.

I am writing this with a bitter
taste in my mouth, but I feel I am
justified for I am the victim of one
of these low-rent acts. I only wish
I had the time to find the scoundrel
who has stooped so low. My notes
are not that good and are barely
legible to anyone but me, but they
are mine and represent a good bit of
time and effort. I only hope that
the rat that stole them makes use
of them and does well because of
them. However, I am willing to bet
that anyone who resorts to such
tactics as notebook stealing won’t do
too well anyway. But that’s no con-
solation to me.

JOHN M. MADISON, JR.

Writer Hits Sports Story

To the Editor:

I read with disgust the article
concerning Coach Bob McHenry and
the basketball team in last Friday’s
Ring-tum Phi.

The author of this article has hit
a high point in bad taste and bad
journalism. I don’t believe I have
seen anything as irresponsible in a
high school paper.

I won’t dispute the author's right
to criticize if he feels criticism is
in order (although I do feel the
criticism was quite indiscriminate
and unfair).

I will, however, take issue with the
method of criticism. Whatever the
author has to say ought to be credit-
ed to him. In the article he says,
“All the students admire guts.” It
would seem the anonymous knife-
thrower is sorely lacking in this
admirable virtue .

As I have said the irresponsible
nature of this whole thing is disgust-
ing. I suppose the blame must rest
with Editor Nea and Sports Editor
Mongeau. Well gentlemen, I hope
you are pleased this journalistic
abomination appeared under your
auspices.

Tom Pace Praises ‘Through A Glass Darkly’

By TOM PACE

Ingmar Berman’s “Through a
Glass Darkly” began today at the
Lyric Theater. It has received world-
wide praise. The Saturday Review,
The New Yorker, Sight and Sound,
and Time magazine all held it in
high esteem. And if I can’t always
respect Time’s “I-have-to-be clever”
reviewer, at least when he rates a
film in his top ten, it usually is a
movie with merit.

I might mention that two band-
wagon jumpers, Bosley Crowther of
the New York Times and the Motion
Picture Academy also have honored
this film. I have not seen it, but I
have seen other Bergman’s and if
this is in line with his others it is
probably well worth seeing.

Period of Adjustment

I mentioned “Period of Adjust-
ment” last week, but too briefly. It
is a movie based on a Tennessee
William’s play. And _ unbelievably
enough, it is a comedy. Isobel Len-
hart has reworked the script and
done it successfully. The main source
of comedy, however, lies in ‘the
plot and the acting. Jim Hutton
and Tony Franciosa are both excel-
lent, and Jane Fonda, at the very
least, is adequate. It’s a welcome

 

the normal Williams
(the normal William’s play about
subnormal, perverted people held
together by a depressing, perverted
plot).

change from

Another Successful Comedy

The Lyric follows “Through a
Glass Darkly” with “The Sheepman”
and “Please Turn Over” in a double-
bill. I can only guess here, too. But
my guess is that anything with
Glen Ford and Shirley MacLane is
bound to have its moments of enter-
tainment, and that “Please, Turn
Over” should be another in a string
of successful British comedies.

“The Bridge” begins at the Lyric
Sunday and is a fine, well-made,
overrated movie, But overrated only
because it has been very highly
praised, and I didn’t think it deserv-
ed quite so much. However, many
have disagreed with me, so I rec-
ommend it to you with only my
reservation,

Recommends Billy Budd

There is one film coming that I
want to see. It will run the first
week of exams, Sunday through
Saturday, at the State Theater. It
“Billy Budd.” Billy Budd the
novel is a classic in American lit-
erature. The film has been well re-

is

 

ceived by almost every critic I have
read. It was written, directed, and
starred in by Peter Ustinov, who
is indeed a genius. He has proved
himself in other films, and has
supposedly fulfilled his promise in
“Billy Budd.” I recommend it with
one insignificant reservation; I have
not yet seen it.
No Critical ‘Criteria’

Several persons have asked me
what I look for in a movie, how do
I judge them, have I set up some
criteria. No, none that I refer to
for each review. Usually the film has
to strike me in some way. It must
be entertaining first. Then I have to
notice the acting (the way James
Mason made me watch his hands and
face in “Lolita’”), the direction (the
way a camera photographs a certain
scene, like the fight scenes in “The
Miracle Worker”) or the dialogue
must impress me with certain lines
(like almost any line in “Two for the
Seesaw” or “Lover, Come Back”),
I don’t necessarily watch for the
acting, the direction, the screenplay.
I would need thirty eyes. Instead
I leave it up to the film to show
itself to me.

On the Paramount Inn
Not concerning films, I have a

 

mild rebuttal to make. The Friday
edition had a column which sor-
rowfully belabored the vanishing
of the “old” Paramount Inn. I, too,
know many of the boys who used
to always go there. But I also know,
and am one of those, who still do.

It seems to me that Friday’s col-
umnist has been respectfully remin-
iscent of ‘old’ Chip and Phyllis, but
in doing so, has distastefully inti-
mated that the new management
will not be too good. This seems that
it might cause discontent with a
Lexington merchant, and that it un-
deservingly complains about his
business. I disagree, and want to
support it. The new Paramount has
at least got decent food—and an in-
teresting new clientele.

Back to the Flicks

Back to films. There is a new so-
ciety being formed. Mr. Taylor, the
organizer of ReVue, promises to
bring us good film classics. If he
can, and I am sure he will, it should
prove a success. I only hope that
this society can be instrumental in
helping students to appreciate the
really good film—the film that is
now called “arty,” “aesthetic,” or
what have you. It is the film which
has made the cinema an art.

 

Dr. Borden Discusses English Education With Reporter.

Faculty Spotlight

 

Borden Won Military Star

By DAVID SHUFFLEBARGER

When one thinks of the basic and
fundamental subjects of an educa-
tion, he usually turns first to Eng-
lish as the foundation for learning.

Dr. Arthur Ross Borden, Jr. pre-
sents us with an excellent repre-
sentative of our English Department.

Dr. Borden, one of the depart-
ment’s three professors, was born
in Boston, Mass., and attended Rox-
bury Latin School for his secondary
education.

From there he went to Harvard
University where he earned his
Bachelor and Master of Arts plus a
Doctorate in Philosophy.

Secret Service Agent

During the Second World War, Dr.
Borden began in the heavy field
artillery and then was transferred
to the Office of Secret Service. He
served throughout the Mediteranean,
in Italy, France, North Africa, and
finally in Germany.

The British Government expressed
their gratitude for his deeds by
awarding him the Officer Order of
the British Empire, while his own
country honored him with the
Bronze Star.

Teaching Lifetime Goal

Professor Borden has always had
teaching as his goal. He came to
Washington and Lee in 1952 and was
appointed to his present position in
1959. In the past academic year he
acted as head of the department. He
teaches first and second year English,
sixteenth century literature, and
contemporary literature.

 

For World War II Service

Last summer, he studied in Eng-
land at the Shakespeare Institute
located at Stratford-on-Avon, There
he did research on Shakespeare’s
history plays, a project that he has
been working on for some time.

Heads Literature Seminars

The English Department and the
Shenandoah co-sponsor the Wash-
ington and Lee Seminars in Litera-
ture, of which Dr. Borden is chair-
man.

The Seminars were founded in the
same year that he came to the uni-
versity, and bring four outstanding
literary figures to the campus each
year. Late this past year, Dr. Borden
gave several lectures in this pro-
gram.

College Board Official

Currently the pipe - smoking
gentleman has been serving on the
writing sample and advanced place-
ment committees for the College
Entrance Examination Board. He is
the chief reader for the English
Achievement, State department, and
law admission tests of the Education-
al Testing Service.

Concerning English education at
Washington and Lee, Dr. Borden
said, “The English here has a lot
of tradition behind it, and I think it
has proved itself. Students who have
majored in English and then gone
on to law, medicine and advanced
English, tell us how valuable the
knowledge they received here is.
Our courses are going through some
transition, to become more suitable

‘A Small, Blood-Sucking

Flesh- Eating

By TRACY HARRINGTON

Anybody ever call you a “small,
flesh-eating, blood-sucking animal
that comes out at night?”

Chances are, they have—without
your realizing it; for that’s the defi-
nition of a “mink,” and minks are

what the Veemies have been calling

W&L students for over 100 years.

Snaking Veemies’ Dates

According to Dean Gilliam, the
cadets thought up the term when
students developed the habit of
“coming out at night”—after the
Veemies were put to bed—to snake
Cadets’ dates.

We understand, also, that the
term—complete with definition—ap-
pears in the VMI Rat Handbook.

When we looked around, we found
a few other stories about the origin
of words that long ago were incor-
porated into the W&L vocabulary.

“Keydets,” for instance, probably
began as a derogatory term ap-
plied to the VMI cadets.

Keydets Derogatory

We couldn’t find out how or why
the term originated, but Dean Gil-
liam told us that when the student
newspaper first started at the Ins-
titute, it was called The Keydet.

VMI alumni, however, protested
to this, saying that the term was
used “offensively.” So now the news-
paper is The Cadet.

The UVa. nickname, Wahoo, was
first part of a college football cheer
that starts “Wahoo Wa, Wahoo
Wa...” And that’s all we could find
out.

 

The tradition of the Cadet’s salut-

 

Night Beast’

ing Lee Chapel evidently began
when the recumbent statue of Lee
was placed in the Chapel, according
to Col. Wm. Couper, former gradu-
ate of VMI.

Statue Was Hidden

An interesting sideline here is that
the statue, which was received at
Washington and Lee in 1875, was
kept hidden until the dedication
of the Chapel seven years later.

Finally, we discovered that Ring-
tum Phi came from an old college
cheer—which is all we'll say for
now, since that makes a good story
when we've got too much space on
the second page.

Good Coaching Plus
‘Team Effort Equals Win,

.

Basketball is a strange game. For those of us who thought
that the Washington and Lee variety of the ancient cage sport
was lower than the underside of a snake’s belly, last Tuesday

 
  

was quite a pleasant shock.

The Generals, playing as though the communists had
broken through their last line of defense and were pushing
them into the sea, devastated a crack Hampden-Sydney outfit,
73-62, in machine-like fashion.

Going into the contest, W&L was anywhere from a 15-to
40-point underdog to the second-best offensive club in the
national small college ranks, but this did not phase the oes
Generals.

Coach Bob McHenry had drilled his boys for nearly a)
week in preparation for the tough Tigers. The gratifying result
was a fantastic zone-press defense that so completely wrecked
Hampden-Sydney’s patterns that the Tigers never were able
to click.

The Tigers not only had trouble getting the ball up the
court, but then they could not work it in to their super scorer
Bill Hardin. Hardin brought a 27.9 average into the game,
and left with one of the lowest point productions in four years,
ten points.

Thanks to the zone-press and some top-notch defensive
play by captain Rodger Fauber and center Howard Martin,
Hardin made the contortions of an Indian snake-charmer look
like child’s play compared with the moves he had to make to
score his ten points.

Offensively the Generals were just as great. Firing with the
deadly accuracy of a Polaris missile, W&L sank all of its first
14 shots from the floor. Fauber and guard Louie Paterno led
this bombing attack which left Hampden-Sydney on the short
end of a 22-11 score midway through the first half.

This tremendous effort against Hampden-Sydney quickly
brings to mind another superlative effort by a Washington and
Lee basketball team—the ten-point victory over the University
of Virginia in 1961.

Certainly the win over our big brother to the North was a
great one, but Tuesday night’s smashing of the H-S Tigers
was even greater.

If you think back, Virginia had a miserable night against
the Generals, hitting something like 22 per cent of their shots
from the floor.

Hampden-Sydney, despite being out-played all night, was
no pushover. The Tigers took good shots and made a good 38
per cent.

W&L was out to win and they did.

Hats off to Coach Bobby McHenry for his excellent coach-

Wednesday

Washington and Lee faces a cru-
cial two-game home stand which
can make or break its season before
the two-week exam layoff.

The Generals, who own a 3-7
record, face Bridgewater’s improved
Eagles Wednesday night and Old
Dominion’s Monarchs Saturday
night.

Bridgewater Tough

One of the three W&L wins came
at Bridgewater and Coach Bobby
McHenry is hoping to make it two
in a row over the Eagles.

With superstar Rodger Fauber, the
nation’s fourth small college re-
bounder, going great guns, and
junior Tom Supak back in the line-
up after a month-long illness, the
Generals should be at top strength
for the Eagles.

In their last four outings the
Eagles have bowed to Old Domin-
ion, 88-68; Randolph-Macon, 71-61;
and Hampden-Sydney, 109-84; and
whipped Lynchburg College, 72-62.

Of course, W&L mauled Hampden-

Sydney, 73-62, last week, but fell
victim to an aroused Lynchburg
quintet, 64-63.

Eagles Attack

Bridgewater’s attack is a double
barrel one, led by John Edwards and
Tom Landes. Both these high-flying
Eagles are averaging in double
figures.

The Generals placed two men in
every event except the 200-yard
backstroke in which they managed
only a third.

Casto Shines

Freshman Don Casto turned in an
outstanding performance in winning
the 50-yard freestyle with a 238
in Wake’s big pool. Ridge Grant
captured third for the Generals.

Walt McManus and Bob Bokinsky
gave the Generals a one-two finish
in the 200-yard butterfly with times
of 2:36.4 and 2:38.

Chase Wins Breaststroke

Sophomore Skip Chase accounted
for the other individual first for
Washington and Lee with a victory
in the 200-yard breaststroke. Again
fine swimming by freshman Bokin-
sky enabled the Generals to finish
one-two in a tight race which saw
only two seconds separate the first
three men. Chase’s winning time
was 2:40.6.

Washington and Lee jumped off to
a 7-0 lead by grabbing the 400-yard
medley relay in 4:30.6 Art Broad-
dus, Chase, Dud Warwick, and Herb
Jahncke swam the relay.

Wake Forest, a member of the
Atlantic Coast Conference, pulled
to within six points with a first in
the 200-yard freestyle, but that was
as close as they came until the
meet’s final event.

Freestyle sensation John Wolf
captured a pair of seconds for the
Generals in the 200-yard freestyle
and the 500-yard freestyle.

Lifter Gets 2 Thirds

Freshman John Lifter picked up
two thirds in the 200-yard individ-
ual medley and the 500-yard free-
style.

On English Education

On English education in the United
States in general, Dr. Borden said
that he felt that “most people and
especially engineers” are becoming
more concerned with the necessity
of learning how to express them-
selves capably. After some study,
the General Electric Company said
that the one course most valuable
to their engineers was literature, ac-
cording to Dr. Borden.

He also feels that after the Rus-
sians sent up the sputnik, interest
perked up in the sciences with the
result that studies were made to
improve these courses,

| Allgood Lauds Howard Martin As Basketball ‘Big Man’

(Continued from page 2)

MOST IMPROVED DEPARTMENT—For five years

Borden, a bachelor, has contribut-| \W/gL’s basketball team has had to scrap and scrap because it

lacked a big man. This year the Generals found a big man—

partment—and we hope he is with| 6-5 Howard Martin—and he’s already paying dividends.

Martin started slowly, but came into his own in the final

‘game before Christmas when he scored 14 points and snared

a season-high of 27 rebounds as the Generals whipped Penn-

sylvania Military College.

The big junior continued this fine pivot play against Hamp-

'den-Sydney, tallying 10 points and grabbing 13 rebounds.

Martin’s rebounding and newly-found scoring punch can well
be cited as the difference in the Generals win over the Tigers, if
any single performance can be called the difference.

still rolling along undefeated. Latest victim was Gallaudet,
which fell 24-10. Prospects for a real good record are looking

better and better.
