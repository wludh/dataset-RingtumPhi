Alpha debate fraternity No-
vember 16-17 in the second
WéL defense of the district
debate championship.

Senior Bill Boardman, president
of the Virginia district of TKA, an-

Selection of W&L as the site of |

 

bitter floor fight between Richmond
and W&L at last year’s tournament.
Coupled with Boardman’s election
as president and Washington and
Lee’s winning the TKA champion-
ship, it represents a remarkable as-
cendanecy for the university in re-

Boardman plans to exert leader-
ship to expand and improve the
quality of debating in this region.
He said the tournament is planned
with four rounds of debate and a
contest in extemporaneous speaking.

‘Observer’

Washington and Lee and the Col-
lege Athletic Conference moved into |
the national spotlight Sunday with a
front page spread in the National |
Observer.

This non-subsidized conference,
consisting of W&L, Sewanee, South-
western, Centre, and Washington
University of St. Louis, was classed
as standing for “No pay, no pressure, |
no hypocrisy,” by the Observer.

It’s “proving that intercollegiate
sports can be amateur, successful,
and fun for all—players, fans, alumni
even faculty.”

The formation of the conference
was announced in January 1962.

“Conference rules state: ‘All par-
ticipation in sports by members of
its teams shall be solely beeause of
interest in and enjoyment of the
game. No financial aid shall be given
to any student which is conditioned
upon, or for the purpose of encour- |
aging, his participation in intercol- |
legiate athletics.”

and Ring-tum Phi

Reverend King —
Writes For Aid

A form letter from Martin Luther
King requesting contributions to the
“crusade for freedom and dignity
for all Americans” which was re-
cently posted on the ODK bulletin
board, has drawn no response Bill
Lowry told the Ring-tum Phi yes-
terday.

The letter, addressed to “Dear
Friend of Freedom,” was supposedly
written from the City Jail of Albany,
Georgia, where King was jailed this
past August for demonstrations on
government property

King stated in the letter that the
“Albany Movement” was being sup-
ported by the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, of which he
is head, but that that organization
was running out of funds.

His letter read, in part, “The need
is urgent, your contribution is criti-
cal to the success of our efforts.
Your answer to this appeal will be
a great source of encouragement
to all of us here on this new battle-
front in the non-violent crusade for
freedom and dignity for all Ameri-
cans.”

According to the letter, some 1100

 

through August 3, involved the prac-
tical application of military tech- |
nology. At least six Distinguished |
Military Students awards were |
earned during the course of the|
camp; superior leadership is the |
requirement for the honor.

 

Of the 21 colleges and universi- |
ties represented at the camp, the|
W&L contingent scored a sixth place |
rating overall, placing the group in|
the upper third. Sam Bloch, W&L’s
new Battalion Commander, was
awarded the Best Cadet Award from
his company composed of 200 cadets. |

Three Staff Additions

The military department under-

_ went three staff changes to begin this
| school year. First Lieutenant D. A.

Branscome has been appointed to
replace Captain H. J. Hall, a profes-
sor here for three years, now de-
parted for duty in Vietnam. Lt.
Branscome will teach junior ROTC
students. Sergeant McSheffrey re-
placed Sergeant MecMillion, who left
for service in Germany.

The new commander of the De-
partment of Military Science, replac-
ing Major E. J. Roxbury, is Lieu-
tenant Colonel Jack P. Burch, pres-
ently a member of the Engineer
Corps stationed in Korea. Lt. Col.
Burch will leave Korea in October
to arrive here in November. He has
previously been a member of the
ROTC detachment at the University
of Oklahoma.

Negro citizens had been jailed for
“peacefully protesting”, and part of
the money would be for “providing
relief for the families of those who |
have been jailed” The money would
also be used for “meeting the ex-
penses of court trials,” and financing
a “mass Voter Registration Crusade.”

Board Selection

Is Announced

Selection of new members of the
Dance Board Advisory Committee
will be made during the next week,
chairman Ed Croft announced to-
day.

Now in its second year of exist-
ence, the Advisory Committee of 25
will be mainly limited to freshmen
sophomores this year. Its function
is as “ a means of relating the ac-
tions of the Dance Board to the
students.” In order to do this the
committee members recommend
bands and entertainers in popular
demand by the student body.

Croft, who heads the committee
in his capacity as vice president of
the Dance Board, emphasized that
his committee offers one of the few |
opportunities available to freshmen |
to take a hand in student affairs.

Croft asked for written applica-
tions from interested students, to}
be addressed to Ed Croft, Box 738. |

 

 

 

Fraternities Say No
To Delay In Rush

In Radical Change

By RANDY JONES

A majority of W&L’s 18 fraternity presidents voiced dis-
approval Monday of IFC president Ross Kyger’s plan for a
four weeks delay in rushing next year.

In informal roundtable discussion with house presidents

editors, Kyger with IFC official Tony

——————%k Schlesinger proposed a plan based

on three points:

1. For a period of four weeks
freshmen would have no fraternity
contacts.

2. During this period, the IFC
would sponsor two mixers and a
freshman party.

3. Rush would begin on the fourth
weekend.

Under the proposal, freshmen
would be eligible or ineligible for
rush, depending on S and U reports.
Also, every freshman would be
to see all 18 fraternities.

Presidents Oppose Plan

Most of the fraternity presidents
at the meeting voiced strong disap-
proval of Kyger’s plan. The main
objections raised were:

It would make for increased ani-
mosity between fraternities, and in-
crease the chances for so-called
“dirty rushing”

The four-week delay would be a
strain, both on fraternity men and
on freshmen, and bring about an in-
terruption in academics well into
the start of the semester.

Delayed rush would give fresh-
men the opportunity to form cliques
which would hamper fraternities
choosing a class, and result in forced
“package deals.”

The proposal, if carried out, would
increase the financial burden of the
fraternities.

Towards the end of the discussion,
the general consensus was that a
“radical change” like Kyger’s in the
rush system would serve no real
purpose.

Revise Present System

One of the participants suggested
that, instead of a completely reno-
vated rush program, a few revisions
in the old one would be more de-
sirable.

The only two revisions to the old
system mentioned were making it
possible for all freshmen to see all
18 houses and a mandatory 1.0 grade
point ratio for initiates, with fresh-

Lauds New Athletic Conference

“What's more, an honor system| comes a task and drudgery, it’s not; pus. He spends most of his years

govens the conference. Each mem-

| ber is expected to live up to its

commitments without any policing.

The Old Days

“This new athletic life is not due
to a lack of an athletic tradition. In
1950, Washington and Lee won eight,
lost two, and played in the Gator

| Bowl.”

Centre, Sewanee, and Southwest- |

ern all were powers in football's |
olden days
“Long ago, though, each of the

schools quit subsidizing athletes, and
knueckled down to the job of turn-
ing out students. Their decision—
and the new conference—are steps |
in American edueation’s drift toward
higher academic standards.

“Bob Payne, W&L tackle and sen-
ior co-captain from Louisville, Ky.,
comments: “They don’t drive us until
we're ready to drop dead. We all|
have a good time. When football be- |

football. Here we enjoy it.’

“On the typical campus, perhaps |
5 per cent of the male students take |
part in varsity athletics. At Wash-
ington and Lee, it’s 33 per cent—
350 of the all-male school’s 1,050
undergraduates. And under the pro-
gram of purity, no sport is more im-
portant than any other. So-called |
minor sports—soccer, lacrosse, golf, |
tennis—get all the money and equip- |
ment they need.

“Washington and Lee President
Fred Cole sees the CAC as giving
the collegiate athlete a ‘fair shake’ |
at last. This may sound peculiar in

 

 

| view of critics’ charges that college

athletes are recruited, coddled, and
ride an educational gravy train that
education can’t really afford.

“But Dr. Cole’s point is interest-
ing. To him, and to others in the|
CAC the pressures of big-time col- |
legiate athletics shunt the athlete

into an isolated corner of the cam- |

pursuing one thing: Athletics. Dr.
Cole reasons that if he’s brought
into the mainstream of campus life,
and forced to live and study as any
other student, his horizon will ex-
pand. New talents will be uncovered.

No Athletic De-emphasis
“CAC officials say they aren't
crusading for purity in college ath-
leties. Their policy fits them fine, At
the same time, Dr. Cole wryly says:
‘A great many schools could profit
from this.’

“He insists there’s no de-emphasis
on athletics at all. To the contrary,
the program aims at making athletics
open to all. In Washington and Lee’s
case, it's worked. Dr, Cole used the

| word de-emphasis in this sense: ‘If

a kid is the best football player in
the world but doesn’t have the
grades, he’s de-emphasized out of
school’.”

The Mississippi Crusades

A distinguished Negro author, James Baldwin, has pointed
out that “crusades have a way of becoming bloodthirsty.” In
Mississippi, at least three crusades have done just that. James
Meredith has succeeded in mustering all the available forces
of world opinion to aid in his fight to gain entrance to the Uni-
versity of Mississippi. Governor Ross Barnett and his followers,
on the other hand, have used all the means at their disposal
to block Meredith’s entrance, defying the law of the land, and,
at latest report, entertaining notions of secession. And Presi-
dent Kennedy has sent four thousand troops to preserve the
peace at Oxford, or nearly one combat-equipped soldier for
every student at the University.

Remarkably, each of these crusades has been a success.
Mr. Meredith has succeeded in enrolling at Ole Miss. Gov.
Barnett, a la Oval Faubus, is assured of re-election ad infin-
itum. And President Kennedy has acted with unusual “vigor,”
upholding the law, and, incidentally, garnering the U.S. Negro
vote.

But their success was not achieved without loss of life. At
the time of the writing of this editorial, at least two men, one
a foreign correspondent, had been killed, and several others
were critically injured. We may be sure that these episodes,
and those that are sure to follow, will be sensationalized in
every newspaper in the world.

And it was all predictable. Mississippi, after all, was the
home state of Emmet Till and Mack Parker. Crusades are par-
ticularly bloodthirsty in Mississippi.

Just who is at fault? The conduct of Mississippi students
and citizens can in no way be excused, but neither can the
conduct of James Meredith and the Federal Government.
Violence breeds violence, and by irresponsibly forcing inte-
gration on the University of Mississippi, Meredith and the
government have fanned the prejudices of the racial fanatics,
hindered rather than helped the cause of integration, and
lowered America in the estimation of the rest of the world.

Congratulations

The Dance Board’s overwhelmingly successful dance plan
subscription sales this year shouldn’t really come as a surprise to
anyone. The board has worked hard to give W&L the kind of
entertainment that will please the often picayunish student
body. Bringing such people as Clyde McPhatter, The Shirelles,
and the Coasters here for Openings indicates the Dance Board
has been putting forth some real effort.

Purchase by 92 per cent of the student body of dance
plans is a far cry from the situation two years ago when no-
body but freshmen could be talked into buying the yearly sub-
scriptions.

Last year’s group did a commendable job. They gave us
four top-notch weekends, and brought W&L Dance Sets into
the realm of respectability again.

Now, with a rousing beginning already under their belts,
this year’s board should show some tremendous advances. They
have all kinds of ideas—training of younger members to take
top positions, the Dance Board Advisory Committee to assist
in planning weekends, and what Frank Young called ‘‘variety”
in this year’s dance sets.

We are behind the dance board 100 per cent and trust they
will continue in the precedent of hard work they’ve begun.

Dr. Jenks: A Year

By BILL ATWELL

The opportunity to do research
is one of the most valuable posses-
sions of an historian. It enables him
to concentrate on particular fields of
interest for which he might other-
wise not have time.

Dr. William Alexander Jenks of
the Washington and Lee Department
of History had such an opportunity
in the past year.

From September, 1961 until the end
of June 1962, Dr. Jenks was in
Vienna working under a Faculty
Fellowship awarded by the Social
Science Research Council. This fel-
lowship was supplemented by a Ful-
bright Travel Grant to Austria.

Taaffe Ministry

While in Vienna, Dr. Jenks com-
pleted research on a project he be-
gan in 1954 concerned with Taaffe
Ministry in Austria from 1879-1893.
Most of Dr. Jenks’ work was done
in the State Archives of Austria and
the Parliamentary Library.

In addition to the research he con-
ducted, Dr. Jenks also gave seven
lectures as part of the United States

 

Information Agency’s Program in
Austria. Of particular interest is the
fact that he delivered one of the
lectures in German.

 

Dr. Jenks

Despite all this activity, Dr. Jenks
still managed to find time to be
a member of the Fulbright Selec-
tion Committee for Austrian Appli-

in Historic Vienna

cants for 1961-1962. This committee | Vienna and it was well worth a few

is an important cog in the exchange |

program of the country.
Second Visit

This stay was not Dr. Jenks first
visit to Vienna. In 1955 he spent a
half year there with his family and
was there again in the summer of
1959.

Dr. Jenks’ family was in Vienna
with him the past year, and accord-
ing to Dr. Jenks, they enjoyed them-
selves a great deal. The children
attended the American School of
Vienna during the year. They also
had the special treat of going to ski
school in February.

Dr. Jenks said that one of the big-
gest problems Americans have in
Vienna is the inability to buy goods
in a small area. For example, to buy
goods for a meal you have to go
to six or eight shops instead of one
or two. In the cold Vienna winters
this problem becomes increasingly
acute,

Center of Achievement

Discussing the disadvantages Dr.
Jenks said he enjoyed his stay in

 

inconviences. Being in a center of
historical achievement was import-
ant in that it gave him an opportun-
ity to catch up with what the Aus-
trian historians had been doing in
recent years. In addition he was able
to read the dissertations that have
been coming out of the University
of Vienna, which, because they
might never be published, would not
be available to him in this country.

On the way back to the United
States, the Jenks family traveled
through the Rhineland and Belgium
before going on to England. Dr.
Jenks said Amsterdam and London
were particularly interesting. This
was Dr. Jenks first trip to England
and he said he was most impressed
by the warmth of the people. It was
much greater than he expected.

A voyage from Southampton to
New York on the S.S. United States
ended this particular European trip
for Dr. Jenks and his family. Talk-
ing to him, however, you get the
impression this won't be the last
trip—not by a long shot.

 

W & L Alumnus Seeks
Congressional Position

By TRACY HARRINGTON

The tradition of Washington and
Lee as a “prep school for politicians”
is being carried on right here in
Rockbridge County.

John Otho “Jack” Marsh, Jr., a
1951 alumnus of W&L law school,
is Democratic candidate for Con-
gress from the 7th District of Vir-
ginia.

This district includes Rockbridge
County and generally all the Shen-
andoah Valley, up to Frederick and
Clarke counties, the home ground
of Senator Byrd.

Marsh seeks to succeed Burr Har-
rison of Harrisonburg, who is not
seeking re-election. Opposing the
W&L alumnus is Kenneth Robin-
son, an orchardist and alumnus of
VPI.

Marsh has received the endorse-
ment of Senator Byrd.

Running against four other office-
seekers, Marsh won the Democratic
primary in July, drawing more votes
than the combined total of his two
closest competitors. Almost half of
the total vote was cast for him, in
what was a light vote.

Robinson was nominated by the
Republicans in convention.

While he was at Washington and
Lee, Marsh was a member of Phi
Psi social fraternity, was Fancy
Dress vice president, a member of
the Cotillion Club, a cross-country
runner, business manager of the
Dance Board, and a Freshman Camp
counselor.

He attended law school on the
combination plan, getting his LL.B.
degree in five years. Prior to his
graduation, he married and his wife
taught in area public schools.

 

For a short time after his gradu-
ation, he was in the real estate
business here in Lexington. But he
and his wife moved to Strasburg,
Va., shortly thereafter. Marsh now
has a successful law practice estab-
lished in Strasburg.

As do many aspiring politicians,
Marsh became a joiner. Two of the
most important organizations in
which he is active are the National
Guard and Junior Chamber of Com-
merce. Both these connections
helped build up the organization
which brought Marsh victory in the
primary campaign.

While his campaign thus far has
been an energetic and active one, he
has been obvious in avoiding open
debate with Robinson. He has dodged
all but two efforts to get him in
face-to-face public meetings with
Robinson; in particular, he declined
an invitation from the Rockbridge
League of Women Voters to a pro-
posed candidates’ meeting in Lex-
ington,

Both Marsh and Robinson are
strongly conservative in the ap-
proaches they are taking before the
voters. These positions, of course, are
consistent with the deep, grass-roots
conservatism of the people of the
Shenandoah Valley.

With a scarcity of real issues be-
tween them, Robinson is trying to
persuade people of conservative per-
suasion to vote for the Republican
Party; Marsh emphasizes the con-
servative nature of the Democratic
Party in Virginia.

Operating Marsh’s local campaign
is another W&L alumnus and
schoolmate, Bill Romans, Lexington

A PROFESSOR SPEAKS OUT

 

Topic Of Debate: Should Free World Economies Unite?

(Editor’s note: The National Debate
Topic of 1962-63 is, Resolved: that |
non-Communist nations of the world |
should establish an economic com-
munity. Washington and Lee, which
last year had more than 40 differ- |
ent men represent the University in |
intercollegiate debates, approaches |
the new season with many promising |
newcomers to join such eutstands |
ing debaters as Bill Boardman, Al |
Eckes, Bill Noell, and Ed Norton, |
who return to do further battle. |
Professor William W. Chaffin will |
direct the debaters again. The sea-|
son will be underway with a tele-|
vised debate in Norfolk, only two |
weeks hence.

Last Thursday Mr. John Gunn, of |
the Economics Department discussed
the topic with fifty-odd men who}
have indicated interest in debating |
for W&L this year. That discus- |
sion will continue at 4:30 on
Wednesday in Newcomb 8. Here he |
summarizes for the Ring-tum Phi)

 

the points he made at the first of
these meetings.)

Eo * *

The current college debate topic
is the best one colleges have de-

 

Mr. Gunn

 

bated for many years. It is a tech-,
nically good debate topic because aj
wide variety of arguments and
are both possible and _ reasonable, |
because there will be a premium on}
knowledge and preparation, and be- |
cause it affords large opportunity |
for exercise of the skills of argu-
mentation and persuasion. It is a|

 

refreshing topic, on the real front-|
ier of public policy and not in the
clean-up detail, as so many debate
topics have been. Most of all, it is
an important subject that is intel-|
lectually exciting.

‘To Strengthen the Free World

The heart of this debate is an at-
tempt to find means to increase the |
unity of the Free World and to|
strengthen it otherwise by improv-
ing its efficiency of production. The
problem, of course, is to increase
unity and improve efficiency through
means that will not restrict signifi-
cantly the soverignty, or indepen-
dence of action, of the individual |

| confluence

nations. The debate will be primarily
a contest of alternative means; few
would wish to challenge the objec-
tive suggested here.

Union: An Historical Trend

The particular suggestion of an
economic community of the non-
communist nations arises from the
of several
trends of long standing, urgently
brought into still sharper focus by
the continued pressure of the Sino-
Soviet threat to the Free World.

historical |

 

On the one hand, there has been)
a tendency throughout modern his- |
tory for consolidation of smaller
political entities into larger ones.
Sometimes such consolidations have
begun in the form of unions for
limited purposes, from which de-
veloped such commonality of inter-

 

ests as to make tighter unification
both painless and all but inevitable. |
(Specialists call this a “functional |
approach to integration.”) Such a

limited union was the tariff union of
Germanic states undertaken in 1834,
the Zollverein. Such a union appar-
ently is the European Community,
established in 1958 under the terms
of the Treaty of Rome.

International Groups

Running concurrently with this
trend since sometime in the nine-
teenth century has been develop-
ment and proliferation of interna-
tional organizations.
War II this trend has been modi-
fied especially in the direction of
regionalism, as evidenced by the
developments in the European Com-
munity, the Arab League, Latin
American groupings, and others.

International commercial policy
developed in the nineteenth Century
toward greater freedom in interna-

Since World)

tional trade and payments, with the |

United States running generally
counter to the trend. The First
World War, the inter-war period,

 

the World War II, represented a time
of set-back to the trend toward
freer trade, with the United States
again counter to the trend from
1934, when the Reciprocal Trade
Agreements Program was undertak-
en. With the recovery of European
production in the 1950's, however,
Europe began to lead the way once
more toward more liberal commer-
cial policy. The United States was
dragging its feet, until the present
Congress took action which, within
the next week or two, should give
this country a Trade Bill under
which it can take its place among
the leadership in world economic
policies .

Now, under the pressure of the
East-West Conflict, and with the
European Community as an imme-
diate model, the colleges will de-
bate this topic. It is a topic of real
importance for the Free World. It
should provide exciting material
for collegiate debate.

Lynchburg tackle Starke Sydnor

Tenn., turned in what coach Dana
Swan termed “varsity performances”
as they anchored W&L’s defensive
line .

The line halted Woodberry drives
at the W&L two-, five-, and nine-
yard lines.

Staunton, always one of the tough-
est teams on the Light Brigade’s
schedule, rolled to its second vic-
tory last week, crushing E. C. Glass,
9-0.

“We expect Staunton to be tough
as usual,” Swan said.

“We gave them their toughest half

exploded and beat us, 28-0,” he
added.

“Really Knocking”

“The boys showed me that they
are really going to knock on de-
fense,” he said.

But he readily admitted that the
Brigade must work on its offense
which managed only 75 yards total
and two first downs.

“Our line was a little slow offen-
sively, but the backs made it look
worse at times by not getting to their
holes quickly enough.

“The line gave us pretty good pass
protection, but we couldn’t get far
enough away from our own goal
line to throw as much as we would
have liked.”

The Brigade travels to Staunton
for its 3 p.m. clash Friday.

 

Swan was especially pleased with

 

  
 

FLYING GENERAL—Washington and Lee halfback

Henry Sackett (20) and unknown lineman try to clear the

What’s Happening In Sports

 

Soph Backs Shine; Blain A Cheerleader; Net Play Opens

Washington and Lee’s sophomore
backs have been outstanding in the
varsity’s first two games this season.
These “inexperienced” backs have
gained 102 of W&L’s 396 yards rush-
ing.

Skip Chase has picked up 52 yards
in 10 carries, Bill Lee has 11 yards
in two tries, Dan Manson, 19 yards
in 5 runs, and Julius Winfield, eight
yards in four attempts.

Bill David seems to be the “prize”
among the sophs, gaining 20 yards
rushing in seven tries and catching
five passes for 74 yards. David's
aerial talents have netted more
yardage than any W&L receiver
managed in nine games in 1961. Not
since 1959, when Jim Hickey grab-
bed 13 passes for 250 yards in nine

with his antics from the stands as
he cheered the Light Brigade to a

Generals’

Defense

Keys 28-6 Victory
Over Dutchmen

Saturday was supposed to be that long-delayed day of reck-

oning for Washington and Lee’

s football win streak.

The reckoner was to be Lebanon Valley College of Penn:
sylvania, coached by former W&L star center Bill McHenry.

That long-delayed day of reckon-*——————

ing, however, had to crawl back into
its secluded cellar to wait for an-
other day as the Generals rolled to}
a shocking 28-6 victory over the in- |
vaders from Pennsylvania.

How did the Generals whip this
Lebanon Valley team which most
informed sources favored by six to
eight points?

Superior Line Play

Superior line play by all three
W&L units is the best explanation
of the triumph which extended the
Generals’ win string to 15 games and
their streak of games without a loss
to 21.

Time and time again W&L’s line,

Bob Payne, guard Mickey Walker,
center Mike Sheffey, and end John
Madison, ran over the Dutchmen’s
heavier line to stop the ball carrier
in the backfield or throw the LV
passer for a long loss.

Only slippery running by Leban-
on Valley quarterback Wes MacMil-
lian kept the Dutchmen’s rushing
total out of the minus column.

MacMillian wiggled his way out of
many tight situations, including one

 

where five W&L tacklers appeared
to have him thrown for a 20-yard
loss. MacMillian, however, emerged
from the encircling Generals and
raced for a 16-yard gain.
Offensively W&L’s line contribut-
ed just as much as it did defensively
It opened gaping holes for the
Generals’ backs, gave quarterback
Chuck Lane good protection for his
passing, and blocked superbly.

Norman Dashes

Fumbles set up for four of the
game’s five touchdowns.
The Generals’ 57-yard fourth

quarter drive resulted in the only
legitimate tally when the Red unit
halfback John Norman raced the
final three yards with 12:09 left in
the game.
