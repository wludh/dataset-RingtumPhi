The pieces which will be re-
produced by the French manu-
facturer are three. The largest of
these is the Arms of Liberty bowl,
cirea 1775, which bears poly-
chrome cartouches of John Wil-
kes, an English satirist who es-
poused the American cause of
independence, and the man who
punished him for his opinions,
Lord Chief Justice Marshall.

A second piece on display in
Atlantic City now is the Saturday
night mug which has “Saturday

The smallest piece being repro-
duced at this time is a double-
handled coffee cup which shows
a polychrome eagle within a
medallion closely resembling the
Great Seal. All these pieces are
hard paste porcelain from 18th
century design.

Negotiations are also underway
for the reproduction of other
pieces of the Reeves Collection
including a soft paste example of
a mid-cighteenth century cream-
er. These reproductions will be
made in the Netherlands by the
N. Y. Royal Delft Ware Manu-
factory, “De Porceleyne Files.”

Much of the work done to pro-
mote the undertaking was effect-
ed by the van Wagenburg fam-
ily whose sons have attended
Washington and Lee. So now, the
people that brought you historic
sheets—‘“our balance sheets’ as
Mr. Whitehead calls them—are

Huntley, John assume

responsibilities off Hill
By Phi News Staff

The faculty has been proving
that they are good for something
else, such as publishing books
and going to conferences, and
now it appears that Washington
Hall is playing catch-up. The
gentlemen on the second floor
have struck out on their own and
their accomplishments in the
outside world are beginning to
come to light.

President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley has been named a director of
the Central Telephone Company
of Virginia. He will be slated for
election to the board of Central
Telephone and Utilities Corpora-
tion, parent of the Virginia com-
pany, at the annual stockholder
meeting next April. President
Huntley is also the president of
the Virginia Foundation of In-
dependent Colleges and a direc-

WésL now offers special courses
in Chinese, East Asian Studies

By Steve Yevich
Phi Staff Reporter

There are over 100 million
people in Japan, and countless
millions more in China, yet only
about 400 Americans per year are
sent to these countries to study,
compared to the thousands sent
to Europe each year.

Obviously more Americans
should be given exposure to Asian
countries, their languages and
customs, their religions and
philosophies, their cultures.

Wé&L is concerned about this
lack of exposure to Eastern cul-
ture and is organizing a new
program on East Asian Studies.

Significant interest in courses
dealing with the two Chinas was
first shown in the winter of ‘71-
72. At that time W&L had two

resident experts on the East: Dr.
Harold Hill (in sinology) and
Mr. I-Hsiung Ju (a native of
China). Dr. Charles Turner also
taught several history courses
dealing with the Orient at the
time.

The core of a Chinese Studies
program was developed, courses
in Mandarin Chinese were add-
ed, and applications were made
for several grants. A $30,000
erant from the Babcock Founda-
tion was received in support of
the new program, which focused
on Chinese language, culture,
political and economic charac-
teristics. Dr. William Pusey, head
of the German department, was
made program director pro tem-
pore.

With the formal inception of
the Chinese Studies program, in-

Dobbs named to fill
position on faculty

by Phi News Staff

Dr. Gary H. Dobbs, UI has
been appointed assistant profes-
sor of biology for the winter and
sprine terms while that depart-
ment continues its search for a
new department head to replace
Dr. Henry S&S. Roberts who died
last February.

A native of Birmingham, Dr.
Dobbs is a 1970 graduate of
Washington and Lee. He was
graduated Summa Cum Laude,
ranking first in his class, and a
member of Phi Beta Kappa. Dur-
ing career here he was a
scholar in every sense: Washing-
ton Scholar Ureshman year),
Robert E. Lee Research Scholar
(1967-69), Alfred P. Sloan Re-
search Scholar (1967-69) and
Henry Ruffner Scholar (1969-
70).

He continued his education at
the University of California at
San Diego where he worked to-

nls

ward a Ph. D. in marine biology.
Dobbs spent six months in the
sfitarclic studying the glycopro-
teins in fish which work as a

permanent’ antifreeze in the

1isn system.

wil be available Wednesday,

muy pick up copies

After completing the five year
program at San Diego in four
years, Dr. Dobbs accepted the of-
fer to return to W&L temporar-
ily. This summer he will begin a
two-year post-doctoral fellow-
ship at the University of North
Carolina studying electron mic-
roscopy.

terest was shown in establishing
courses dealing with Japan. The
addition of Dr. Minor Rogers to
the faculty in 1972 helped to fur-
ther this interest, as Rogers has
a considerable knowledge of Jap-
anese religion, language and cul-
ture.

The acceptance of W&L into
the Luce Scholar Program, a gra-
duate fellowship program design-
ed to send qualified students to
East Asia for study, and the es-
tablishment of the exchange pro-
gram with Chung-Chi University
have also helped to build interest
in studies not necessarily relating
to China, but nevertheless Eas-
tern.

So at present there is a dual
program of sorts: Chinese stu-
dies, under Pusey’s guidance, and
the other Asian studies. There
are efforts now under way to
combine these programs and pro-
vide unified direction under a
Director of East Asian Studies.

“At the moment things are
sprouting all over; the program
is not homogenized.” With that
statement Pusey aptly summed
up the situation. There are many
varied course offerings and pro-
grams, but they seem to be pi-
eeonholed in assorted depart-
ments, and without any central
coordination.

Just what courses with orien-
tal subject material are offered?

|REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

 

If Friday is Thursday,
then this must be W&L

As the winter term begins and everything starts looking
somewhat bleaker we have found one thing which should
make the new year an improvement on the old—the calendar.

The school calendar for next year is in some respects one
that will bring the W&L community back into the world of the
sane. To begin with it recognizes a Friday as a Friday and a
Saturday as a Saturday. This may sound simple enough but
last year’s University Council came up with the not-so-bright
idea of rearranging the calendar in a most unsatisfactory man-
ner.

Last year the faculty gave the UC the power to provide
the school community with a calendar which it would not
even take the time to approve. As a result of its handing over
this function to the UC we have a schedule which shows
classes commencing on a Friday, and as if that was not bad
enough we are asked to treat Friday as Thursday and turn
Saturday into Friday.

For a number of fairly obvious reasons this scheduling
creates hardships on the people it is suppose to serve. Arriv-
ing back on campus for January 3 classes made it necessary for
students from Arkansas and Texas to leave home on January
1, nursing an awful hangover which would have been more
easily coped with from a reclining position while the victim
watched tube. To ask the typical W&L student to venture
onto the highways on New Year’s Day is not only inconveni-
ent and unreasonable—it is nothing less than dangerous.

What has been accomplished by starting classes up on Fri-
day /Thursday? Supposedly it has provided for the correct num-
ber of Thursdays and Fridays in the winter term. After seeing
classes called last week with less than one half of the expected
crowd attending and hearing professors dismiss their students
with the promise to repeat themselves at the next class meet-
ing we doubt that starting the winter term on January 3 has
been too successful,

This is not to say that the university should only approve
policies that the students will adopt and adhere to readily,
but there should be an understanidng of geographical limita-
tions which make it inconvenient for the student who lives be-
yond Glasgow to arrive at school on a certain date.

This year the faculty decided to reassert itself and reclaim
the final word scheduling for the 1975-76 academic year.
Consequently W&L students will be asked to return for classes
which first meet on a Monday—in fact, they will meet on a
Monday that is really Monday, not a Tuesday or Sunday in-
stead.

Next year’s Washington Holiday is an improvement over
this year's in that it is longer, but its placement leaves some-
thing to be desired. That vacation runs from February 12-17
this winter term where it will give students a full week off next
year. It is placed at the end of six weeks of the winter term
which obviously has some merit. On the other hand, this year’s
vacation falls at the beginning of Lent which means that
everyone can go to Mardi Gras and miss two days of classes at
most. Next year the Washington Holiday comes a full week
before Mardi Gras—obviously inconvenient for one who wants
to make the most of one’s time off from the grind,

One serious suggestion that we would like to make is that
some schedule be adopted which will allow students at Wash-
ington and Lee to have a few reading days before exams start.
As it stands, next year students return from Thanksgiving to
find exams staring them in the face the same week, Many other
schools have several days after the end of classes and before
exams start in which students may prepare themselves for
their tests and ask professors questions. Presently many pro-
fessors give short tests in the last few class meetings before
exams which works a hardship on their pupils and gives them
less time to prepare themselves for the holocaust soon to
follow.

In summation, we believe that next year's schedule for the
school is something of an improvement. However, more could
be done to make the calendar relect a more convenient ar-
rangement for the student body. J.L.R.

An interview

Thursday, January 9, 1975

Nuckols speaks of Wé#L’s future

Editor’s Notes The following is
the first of a two-part interview
with the new Rector of the Board
of Trustees, E. Marshall Nuckols.
The interview was telephoned as
a list of questions to Mr. Nuckols
who returned his answers by mail
lo the editor.

1. Q. What do you believe to be
the most important responsibil-
ity of the Rector of the Board of
Trustees?

1. A. If you were to ask that
question a year from now I am
sure I could give you a more
confident answer. After all, I am
still quite new in this job. One of
the most important roles must,
however, be to lead, coordinate,
and motivate the Trustees in
their constant efforts to keep
Washington and Lee the small,
strong, independent educational
institution that it has been for
so Many years.

As Ben Bailey indicated after
his meeting with the Trustees in
Alexandria, we have an excep-
tionally dedicated and concerned
group of men serving on the
Board. All of them believe their
years at Washington and Lee
were among the most important
in their lives and that the Uni-
versity provided them not only
an exceptional educational ex-
perience but also a unique oppor-
tunity to develop traits of char-
acter and leadership that have
stood them in good stead thro-
ughout their adult lives. All of
these men feel a great debt to
the University and are complete-
ly dedicated to preserving similar
opportunities for other students
in the years ahead.

These men need little addition-
al motivation but it is a great

honor to be asked to lead and co-
ordinate their efforts.

2. Q. What would you say is the
role of the Rector in fund rais-
ing?

2. A. One of the most important
functions the Trustees perform
in keeping Washington and Lee
strong obviously is that of rais-
ing funds.

Washington and Lee is a com-
pletely private, independent in-
stitution—receiving no state, fed-
eral, or church support—so fund
raising is critical. Here again the
Rector has a leadership and a
coordination responsibility. The
direct responsibility for capital
fund raising activities has, how-
ever, been assigned to a Develop-
ment Committee of the Board of
which Trustee John M. Stem-
mons is Chairman. This Develop-
ment Committee is devoting a
great deal of time and effort to
the current program to raise cap-
ital funds for the new library
and other campus improvements.
Sydney Lewis, another Trustee,

is chairman of the Current Sup-
port Committee, which devotes its
efforts to increasing the funds
raised from alumni and parents
for annual operating expenses.
The Rector’s role is one of back-
ing up the efforts of these Com-
mittees.

3. Q. Based on your years of close
association with Washington and
Lee what fundamental changes
have you observed in the school?
3. A. I believe—as do other Trus-
tees—that there have been no
significant changes—only im-
provements—in the truly basic
fundamentals which have made
Washington and Lee such a uni-
que institution. The quality of
education offered—the excellence
of the faculty—breadth of the
curriculum—all have improved.
We have a strong, highly quali-
fied school administration and
the University continues to draw
an excellent mix of students. The
honor system still plays an im-
portant role. Ben Bailey’s com-
ments at our Alexandria Trus-

tees’ Meeting indicated that it is
stronger today than it was a few
years ago. There seems to be an
excellent community sense at the
University and students are play-
ing an increasingly meaningful
role in student government and
in the affairs of the University.

There have been changes, of
course, in some of the campus
traditions—dress is more infor-
mal than it used to be—more in-
formal perhaps than some of the
alumni would like. This, of course,
is a trend of the times.

Perhaps the most noticeable
changes have been the improve-
ment in the physical facilities—
the new gymnasium, a new Law
School, the student Center, new
dormitories, and hopefully soon
a new library.

In short, the Trustees are gen-
erally quite pleased with the state
of affairs at the University and
with its administration, faculty,
and student body. We want very
much to keep it that way.

Has grade inflation halted?

If last term’s final grades are
any indication, grade inflation is

To the Students and Faculty of Washington and Lee:
The members of the Student Association for Black Unity

would like to invite you, the students and faculty, to partici-
pate in our Black Awareness Week, January 12-18, 1975. We as
Black students feel that as a part of our education, a part of
any education should encompass an understanding of the peo-
ple and events surrounding them. Our organization’s main ob-
jective is to try to emphasis how the Black man feels, how he
views today’s society and the changes that it goes through;
changes that affect all men, both black and white.

In accordance to our objective, the theme chosen for this
year’s Black Awareness Week is “Projections of Blackness.”
The week is outlined as follows:

Sunday—Dr. David Shannon, Academic Dean, Pittsburgh
Theological Seminary. Speaking on the Black Religious Ex-
perience. 8:00—Lee Chapel

Monday—Samuel Proctor, Dean of Graduate Education,
Rutgers University. Speaking on the Black man and His Edu-
cation. 8 :00—Lee Chapel

Tuesday—Virginia Union University Concert Choir, 7 :00—
Lee Chapel

Wednesday—The Leslie D, Smith Memorial Lecture pre-
sented by Dr. Wyatt T. Walker, Pastor of Canaan Baptist
Church, of New York. Speaking on the Black Man in Ameri-
can Contemporary Society. 8:00—Lee Chapel

Thursday—Mr. Edward Robinson, Athletic Director and
Head Football Coach, Grambling State College. 8:00—Lee
Chapel

Saturday—The Black Ball, Evans Dining Hall. Formal.
Invitation only. Featuring the “98.6” of Washington, D.C.
8:00
This year's Ball is open to all Washington and Lee students.
Invitations may be picked up at the §.A.B.U. office in the Uni-
versity Center before Wednesday, January 15.

The members of the Student Association for Black Unity
extend this invitation to you hoping that you will take it upon
yourselves to come to the presentations during the week, in
order to better understand the presence of the Black in our
society, and perhaps more about yourselves,

ate whether grade inflation has
has actually slowed. No firmly-
based conclusions can be drawn.
Nonetheless, there are several in-
teresting changes in departmen-
tal grade point ratios (GPR) as
compared to the fall term of
1973.

Two departments which regis-
tered significant increases in
GPR from the fall term of 1973
to that of 1974 were politics and
economics, according to the Uni-
versity registrar’s office. The
politics GPR for all courses in
the department rose by .273 to
2.559. The department of econo-
mics GPR rose .101 to 2.332. Poli-
tics and economics are among
those university departments
with the lowest overfall GPR’s at
Washington and Lee.

Not all increases were recorded
by departments with low GPR’s,
however. Those members of the
fine arts curriculum, known to
have one of the highest GPR’s of
any major discipline on campus,
also registered an overall gain in
GPR from fall of 1973 to fall of
1974. The drama GPR climbed
the most of any major discipline
on campus—up .280 to 3.011. The
art GPR rose modestly by .069 to
2.883, while the music GPR de-
clined modestly by .021 to 2.942.

GPR since the fall of 1973. Some
figures; Italian up 306 to 3.0;

Latin up .135 to 2.950; Greek up
182 to 3.0; French up .237 to
2.957; German up .048 to 2.998;
Russian up .050 to 3.050; and
Spanish up .086 to 2.959. Chinese

Comparative literature and bio-
declined .168 to 2.5.
logy also registered gains in GPR
of more than .1. Anthropology,
English, geology, history, journa-
lism, psychology, and religion all
registered increases in GPR of
less than .1.

What departments registered
declines in GPR? Computer sci-
ence recorded the biggest decline
—.225 to 2.464. Accounting de-
clined .227 to 2.258 (the lowest
departmental GPR recorded last
term). Engineering declined .225
to 2.737. Chemistry, philosophy,
physics, public speaking and soc-
iology all registered declines in
GPR of between .1 and .2. Ad-
ministration, mathematics and
military science, all declined less
than .1 of a grade point.

Of all Washington and Lee de-
partments and disciplines, nine
recorded GPR’s last term of 2.5
or below while 10 registered
GPR's of 3.0 or above. Those at
or below 2.5 GPR include, in or-
der from the lowest, accounting,
mathematics, English, sociology,
economics, geology, administra-
tion, computer science, and Chi-
nese. Those with departmental
GPR's of 3.0 or above are in or-

Generals grab WésL tourney title

Winning streak extended to five

iy BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

Washington and Lee turned on
the defense to shut down two
high-powered offensive teams to
win the 6th annual Invitational
Basketball Tournament Satur-
day, stopping Williams College in
the final game, 61-49 .

The Generals got to the finals
by beating Haverford College on
Friday, 56-43. The wins marked
the first time W&L, now 7-1, had
won its own tournament since
1969. The title also extended
W&L's win streak to five going
into Tuesday’s game against
Bridgewater.

W&L head coach Verne Can-
field was forced to go to his
bench more often against Wil-
liams, as injuries had forced
starters Paul Maloney and Guy
Kerr out of the final game.

“We couldn’t hesitate to go to
the bench, especially with Guy
and Paul getting hurt on Friday,”
Canfield said.

Yet the bench came through
with a strong effort, as forwards
Jeff Baum and Bob Flint, and
backcourters Kim Sims and
freshman Bob Forlenza filled the
holes more than credibly.

But the story of the tourna-
ment was the Generals‘ defense,
which now ranks among the top

December in review

five in the NCAA’s Division III.
On successive nights W&L held
teams averaging over 70 points
per game to under 50 points. In
addition, two players, Dick Voith
of Haverford and Harry Sheehy
of Williams, both 24 points per
game scorers, were held to their
career lows of 12 points each.

“The team defense was super
for the entire tournament,” Can-
field said. “Bowman Williams
and John Podgajny did a fine
job in stopipng Voith and Shee-
hy, but it wasn’t their efforts
alone which won the tournament
for us.”

Wiliams, named the most valu-
able player of the tournament,
played two of his finest games for
W&L. He led the Generals’ bal-
anced scoring attack against Ha-
verford with 12 points while
teaming with Podgajny to hold
Voith to 12 points. In the cham-
pionship game Williams scored
eleven points, played an excellent
floor game, and harassed Sheehy,
a Little All-American candidate,
to hold him to 12 points.

Another excellent W&L perfor-
mance came from 6’9” junior
center Norm Kristoff, who join-

ed Williams on the all-tourney
team.

“Norm dominated the middle
in both games, which is very im-
portant to our overall game plan,”
Canfield said. “He did a good job
rebounding, shot very well, and
intimidated enough inside to
force our opponents outside,
which is where we want them to
try to score from.”

Kristoff had the most impres-
sive statistics in the tournament,
shooting better than fifty per-
cent from the field in getting 11
points against Haverford and a
game-high 12 against Williams,
grabbing 22 total rebounds,
blocking five shots, and adding
three assists.

The Generals started slowly
against Haverford, missing 10 of
their first 12 shots. The Fords
grabbed a 7-4 lead, which was
the only lead they held all night.

A Kristoff tip narrowed the
margin to 7-6, then Williams con-
nected on a 25-footer to give
W&L the lead for good. WkL
took a 28-20 lead into the locker
room at halftime, then steadily
increased their lead in the second
half.

Generals winning as ’74 ends

By BILL FLESHER

Phi Sports Editor

For a while Santa Claus couldn't
figure out what to give Washing-
ton and Lee’s winter athletic
teams for a Christmas present.

As a last resort, he decided to
vive them a fun-filled month of
December.

He couldn't have given a bet-
ter present.

With the exception of the
Generals’ basketball loss to Vir-
ginia on December 2, W&L’'s
three winter teams compiled a
perfect 9-0 record in the final
month of 1974.

A recap of December, 1974:

DECEMBER 3—W&L’'s wrest-
lers started their season off with
a 29-11 win over Madison Col-
lege. Sophomores Jim Crytzer
(158) and Steve Schweizerhof
(HVY) recorded pins for W&L,
while senior co-captain Doug
Ford (177), Brian Tray (142),
and Sam Lewis (167) earned de-
cisions. Freshman Howdy Knipp
won his 118-pound match by
forfeit.

Freshman John Hudson broke
the state record in the 1000-yard
freestyle to lead W&L's swimmers
to an easy 61-41 win over Old
Dominion.

Hudson, who in his first meet
at W&L broke school records in
the 200-, 500-, and 100-yard free
style, covered the 40 laps in 9:-
55.00 to break the old record of
10:01.5 held by Bill Bernadino of
Virginia.

The Generals piled up a big
lead early in the meet, and Coach
Bill Stearns let swimmers pick
their own events for the rest of
the meet.

DECEMBER 4—Greg Croghan
canned an 18-foot shot with sev-
en seconds left in overtime to
give the basketball Generals a
63-61 win over VCAA rival Lyn-
chburg College.

Playing their fourth game in
six nights, W&L showed signs of
sluggishness throughout the
contest. The Generals led by as
many as 12 points early in the
second half, but couldn’t hold
it as the visiting Hornets storm-
ed back from a flurry of points to
take a 49-40 lead.

W&L then rallied to tie the
game at 57-all, with Bowman
Wiliams’ 25-footer forcing the
deadlock.

Both teams traded two baskets
in the overtime. Then Croghan
fired up a shot from near the
corner, and the Generals found
themselves up by two.

Lynchburg had one last oppor-
tunity to tie it when John Podga-
jny fouled the Hornets’ Frank
Gough with :03 left. However,
Gough missed the free throw,
and W&L held on to win.

Norm Kristoff led W&L with
15 points and nine rebounds.

W&L's wrestlers earned two
dual meet wins in Petersburg,
Va., downing Virginia State, 25-
17, and Lynchburg, 33-6.

Howdy Knipp (118), Lee Keck
(134), Jim Crytzer (158), Doug
Ford (177), and Bill Cole (190)
each scored two wins for W&L,

Crytzer extended his pinning
streak to three with a pair of
falls.

Cole scored the fastest pin of
the meet with a :34 fall against
Lynchburg.

DECEMBER 16—With Norm
Kristoff scoring a season high 20
points, the basketball Generals
won the first of two games in
Boston, nipping Framingham
State, 70-69.

W&L led by 10 points midway
through the second half, but saw
that lead slip away as Framing-
ham got hot from the outside.

The Generals got two clutch
free throws from Bowman Wil-
liams with :09 left to put the
game out of reach.

W&L coach Verne Canfield said
the Generals were a bit off in
their timing, as was to be expect-
ed after a ten day layoff during
exams.

Canfield added that Framing-
ham State saw W&L as the big
game on their schedule, saying.
“There’s nothing they would
have liked more than to beat the
team that got close to Virginia.”

En route to a swimming vaca-
tion-practice schedule in Flori-
da, W&L's swimmers stopped in
North Carolina long enough to
win two dual meets against Ap-
palachian State, 59-54, and UNC-
Asheville, 77-35.

Junior Bill Tiers was the lone
double winner for W&L, picking
up victories in the 500- and 1000-
yard freestyles.

Haverford made one run late in
the game to close the margin to
48-40, but two field goals by Don
Berlin, who saw extensive action
at center for W&L in the second
half, put the game on ice.

Neither team enjoyed a good
shooting night, as both finished
at around 33 percent. But the big
statistics were the 30 turnovers
committed by Haverford (includ-
ing nine by Voith), and the dif-
ference in shots attempted (W&L
got off 76 shots compared to
Haverford’s 57).

Many saw the Generals as un-
derdogs to Williams in the finals
on the basis of the injuries to
Kerr and Maloney as well as the
Ephmen’s easy 89-71 win over
Kings Point in the opening
round. Sheehy had looked good
in the opener, scoring 27 points
on 12 for 17 from the field.

For a while Sheehy stayed hot,

WeL co-captain Greg Croghan is above the crowd
as he shoots for two of his ten points against

hitting three of his first four
shots to keep Williams within
one of the Generals. But Bow-
man Wililams’ defense then stiff-
ened, as did that of the Generals.

Slowly W&L pulled away from
Williams (the college, that is), as
and they took a 36-25 lead at
halftime. Flint came off the
bench in the first half to score
three clutch baskets, while the
play of Sims and Forlenza at the
playmaking guard continued to
impress the crowd of 1100 in
Doremus Gym.

W&L upped their lead to as
many as 17 points in the second
half before the Ephmen could
make a comeback.

Wiliams (the college, again)
scored seven unanswered points
to close the gap to 10 with seven
minutes left. They moved within
seven at 54-47 with 4:20 to go
before a Jeff Baum basket and

two free throws by John Podga-
jny put the game out of reach.

Kristoff led W&L with 12
points, while Greg Croghan and
Williams (Bowman) added 11
each. Baum, in his first start,
scored 10 points while adding
eight rebounds.

The all-tournament team con-
sisted of Williams, Kristoff, Shee-
hy, Dave Stubbs of Haverford,
and Bill Carter of Kings Point.

Haverford defeated Kings
Point for third place, 69-67.

The Generals take to the road
Saturday, traveling to Baltimore,

University of Baltimore.

Last year’s game in Lexington
was a thriller, with Baltimore
grabbing a one-point win on a

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Nuckols

on WéeL:

optimistic about future

(Continued from page 2)

4. Q. What do you see as the
major challenge facing the Uni-
versity in the immediate future?
Do you think Washington and
Lee can compete effectively in the
future with large Co-Educational
universities on the one hand, and
small community colleges on the
other?
4. A. I have combined these two
questions because they are close-
ly related. The major challenge
facing the University obviously is
a financial one. Washington and
Lee finished last year with a sur-
plus of income over expenditures
of only a few hundred dollars.
The budget for the current year
has no reserve for any contingen-
cies, yet we are faced with a con-
tinuing inflation in all University
expenses.

Tuition

rates have already

been pushed to a level substanti-

ally above tuition expenses at the
large state universities or at the
smailer community colleges. It is
questionable how much further
tuitions could be raised.

This is a problem faced by all
private colleges. Washington and
Lee has been more successful
than most to date. Many other
private schools have had deficit
years.

To meet this challenge we ob-
viously must substantially in-
crease our endowment and the
level of annual alumni giving.
We must also do all we can to
operate as efficiently as possible.

The Trustees believe these chal-
lenges can be met and that there
will continue to be a place for the
small, independent, private col-
leges. We are dedicated to that
goal.

Teams fare well in December

(Continued from page 3)

W&L was without freshman
John Hudson, who did not make
the trip to Florida.

The two wins upped the Gen-
erals season record to 4-1.

DECEMBER 17—Believe it or
not, Washington and Lee played
some of its sloppiest basketball
in a game they won by 59, count
‘em, 59 points.

The Generals had less than no
trouble beating Massachusetts
Maritime, 93-34, despite going
scoreless for some seven minutes
in the first half.

“We found ourselves against
an inept basketball team,” said
Verne Canfield after the game,
“and for a while, nobody seemed
to want to play.”

After jumping out to a 21-4
lead, W&L apparently went into

hiding, and Maritime closed the
gap to 21-16. But after a few
strong words of advice from the
bench, the Generals went on to
score 34 points in a row, includ-
ing the first 24 points of the sec-
ond half.

Junior John Podgajny led four
W&L players in double figures
with 16 points, while Norm Kris-
toff added a season high 17 re-
bounds.

The win was the third in a row
for W&L, leaving the season re-
cord at 5-1 as the players went
home for Christmas.

sufficient student interest in

In addition, resource materials
dealing with the Asian topics are
expanding in the library: Dr.

opment of the program, but are
generally satisfied with the pro-
gram that has been made.
