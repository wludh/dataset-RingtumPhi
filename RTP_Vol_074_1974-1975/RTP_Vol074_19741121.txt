Actually the action at the annual alumni basketball game is
halted so a contact lens can be retrieved from the court. No
matter how friendly the teams, the fans found out the game was
definately for keeps as the alumni gambled for an upset victory
against the WoL varsity. The varsity took the game.

Starting at 6 p.m. Friday,
WLUR will be presenting a Holi-
Marathon for charity with
Tommy Hudgins staying on the
air as long as he can stay awake.

The purpose of the event is to
raise funds for the Rockbridge
Area Relief Association (RARA).
\rea merchants are sponsoring
liudeins with one dollar an hour
contributions to the RARA.

The RARA consists of area
ministers who will handle the
distribution of the donations.
The money will be used to aid
needy families in the Rockbridge
area during Thanksgiving and
Christmas. So far, 28 merchants
have agreed to participate.

day

WLUR has cancelled all of its
regular programming for the
presentation. The format will be
popular music and five minute
newscasts during selected hours.
Hudgins, who will announce the
whole show, says he has no idea
how long he will be able to stay
on the air.

Jeryl Davis, WLUR  gencral
manager, has been pleased with
the response from the merchants.
He says he hopes that other in-
dividuals and organizations such

as fraternities will get involved
by donating money.
Pledges will be accepted by

phone at 463-2869 during the
marathon. Pledges can be made
on the basis of hours or in a
single contribution.

Following the public meetings
in the chapel the members of the

to reach those students who do

outlining some of the major con-
troversies surrounding the honor
system.

Vice-president Bob Keatley
said the fact sheet is “the best
way to start.’ President Ben Bai-
ley added that the purpose of the
project is to gather “constructive
criticism” of the system, not to
conduct a poll. “We're after sug-
gestions, not consensus,” he add-
ed.

Other plans include meeting
with the faculty in small groups
to talk about the instructors’
views on the honor system and
their obligation to it.

Keatley, one of three members
of a subcommittee formed last
week to draw up the format for
the planned study, said the vote

Cold Check committee, reported
that the committee has $200 in

An analysis

What does a grade mean?

By PAUL LANCASTER
Managing [ditor

Editor’s note—T his is the four-
th in a series of articles on grad-
ing at Washington and Lee. This
week, Ring-tum Phi managing
editor Paul J. Lancaster takes a
look at the university policy on
grading.

Each year, the university takes
up a block of space in its catalo-
cue in an attempt to explain
grading at Washington and Lee.
Some excerpts from that block
follow:

_—* ‘A’ (exeellent) is the mark
of highest distinction earned by
that very small proportion of stu-
dents whose work represents ap-
proximately the best that can be
expected of the man of unusual
ability.”

—* ‘B’ (good) is a mark of dis-
tinction ...”

— ‘Cc’ (satisfactory) is the
mark earned by . . . any student
of average ability and prepara-
tion who gives the course a rea-
sonable amount of time, effort,
and attention.”

“p” represents marginal work,
according to the catalogue, and
“F”, of course, “indicates un-
conditional failure.”

In addition to this general
statement on grading at Wash-
ington and Lee, the university
distributes to the faculty infor-
mation on its grading system.
The sheet reiterates what is de-
lineated in the catalogue ,and it
continues:

—‘ ‘A’ and ‘B’ are honor grades

... To merit the grade of ‘B’, the
work must show something be-
yond acquisition ... It is differ-
entiated from ‘A’ by failure to
show excellence in re-
sponse...

—'C’ is the graduation grade.
In awarding the grade of ‘C’, the
instructor should consider care-
fully the criterion set up in the
(catalogue); ... he should also
be convinced that the student is
qualified to pursue a more ad-
vanced course for which this work
is required ...

— ‘D’ grades ... must be bal-
anced by a corresponding amount
of ‘B’ work in other courses.”

From that base of university
policy on grades, professors at
Washington and Lee are sup-
posed to determine a _ grading
system which will reasonably
meet the expectations of the uni-
versity philosophy.

To mention a few points rais-
ed in previous articles:

—Nearly 60 percent of all
evades given last year were grades
of "A” ar *?’.

—More than one-third of last
year’s senior class was graduated
with a 3.0 or better.

~The average senior last year
was graduated with a 2.761. Last
year’s juniors held a 2.799 aver-
age,

The obvious implication is that
the expressed university policy on
grades and the actual grades
awarded do not correspond. “A”
is ‘the mark of highest distinc-
tion earned by that very small
proportion of students . . .” Some

Rec-tum Phi?

Gentlemen (?)

Never before have I thought
that the school newspaper de-
served the name “Ree-tum Phi”
like I did after reading the edi-
torials and “Ask Traveller” in
last week's issue (Nov. 14).

Those columns were the most
callous and libelous excuses for
journalism that I have ever seen
—and you have the self-righte-
ousness to call yourselves journa-
lists!

It is one thing to eall for re-
visions in Executive Committee
and public trial procedures and
quite another to convict men in
your paper who have been public-
ly exonerated.

To Mr. B. S. ‘who wrote the
first editorial), how can the pub-
lic trial be “weighed heavily in
favor of the defendant” when the
jury knows the defendant has al-
ready been convicted by the E.C.?
Doesn't it seem that the defense
has to prove his innocence in-
stead of being proved guilty as it
should be? Does the defense have
any greater right to “voir dire”
than the prosecution? Lastly, you
should ask yourself what you
want out of the public trial. It
seems, Mr. B, S., that all you
what is a ratification of the E.C.’s
decision by a public trial.

To Mr. J.L.R.. no jury every
convened is asked to “determine
euilt or innocence” of a defend-
ant. If a jury conviets it shows
they felt Unere was enough evi-
dence to indicate the defendant's
guilt. If a jury acquits they have,
in essence, determined there was
not enough evidence to indicate
the defendant's guilt “beyond a
reasonable doubt.” Mr. J. L. R.,
do you really believe the E. C.
eenerally has less knowledge of
a defendant than twelve ran-
domly picked students do? I
hardly think so. it is their job
to know people in order to get
elected.

Least of all do I believe any one
eroup, such as the E, C., should
be given first and at the same
time last word on whether a stu-
dent stays or is foreed to leave
WAaL.

The “Ask Traveller’ column
was a sham of good journalistic
ethics, to make a mild under-
statement. Your premeditated
«presumed? misuse fraud in us-
ine the university president's
name for such serious matters
constitutes libel. The delineations
which concluded the column
seem unethical, at the least, in
lHeht of what has happened.

Finally, I fear the day that the
E.C., or for that matter, the edi-
corial staff of the Rec-tum Phi,
becomes the final determinant

for a person's stay at W&L, Maybe
the editorial staff and the E. C.
should consider as many of the
facts as the twelve men on the
jury did. Personally, I would
rather have a dishonorable man
allowed to stay at W&L than an
honorable man be forced to leave.

Student jury:
not at fault

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I wish to respond to your edi-
torial column in last week's issue.
I think that what filled that space
was a fairly accurate representa-
tion of the prevalant opinion of
the University community — cer-
tainly of the students. That is
what disturbs me most.

There seems to be emerging
from the verdicts of the past
three public honor trials a gen-
eral naive belief in the finality of
the E.C.’s convictions. This is
very dangerous to the Honor
System because each time some-
one who has been found guilty by
the E.C. brings his case into pub-
lic light to the student body, the
eeneral feeling seems to be that
he's automatically a dead man.
Then, when and if the student
jury lets him off, the student
community is thrown into great
dismay over whether the Honor
System is effective.

Perhaps the explanation for
this dismay lies in the past three
verdicts of innocence in the past
three public honor trials. Would
the students have more confi-
dence if “justice” were reinforced
by a guilty verdict being inter-
posed every other time or so?
Would the Honor System then be
effective?

The only way the Honor Sys-
tem will work is if the grotesque
assumption that the defendant
should be convicted is overcome.
It is almost as if the students
need to witness periodical pub-
lie verdicts to feel they live in a
community where justice reigns.
In that case we're long overdue
for such a verdict, and I fear for
the fate of the next public Honor
Trial defendant.

I think you're suggestion that
perhaps the public trial proce-
dure be done away with is most
dangerous, for that would almost
totally exclude the students at
large from being involved in the
procedure, Your argument that
the E.C. is after all our elected
officials is most absurd, Student
elections are highly ceremonial
procedures since few have any
idea of whom they vote for. I
agree that the student jury must
be impartial and respect the
lionor System. But as soon as the

22.6 percent of all grades award-
ed last year were grades of ‘A’”’.
That does not seem to be a “very
small proportion of students.”

Consequently, nearly 60 per-
cent of all marks awarded last
year were marks of “distinction,”
as described by grades of “A” or
“B”. To be among the 40 percent
would be more ‘‘distinet.”

“C” is described as average.
Yet the 2.0 numerical equivalent
of a “C” average is some .761
points lower than the average of
last year’s senior class.

And, according to the defini-
tion of the catalogue, about 10
percent of all grades given last
year were given to “marginal”
students and “unconditional fail-
ures.”

“The faculty is simply not fol-
lowing these standards,” says one
Washington and Lee professor.
“The faculty grading informa-
tion sheet and the catalogue
written together are superb in
describing ways in which a stu-
dent may excel. The present prac-
tice of Washington and Lee for
the most part does not confirm
with these standards.

“Does the professor ignore the
need for uniformity in university
grading,’ he continues, “or does
he ignore these admirable stand-
ards?"’ The professor says that
faculty members who want to
conform to these standards and
who additionally want to bring
uniformity to the Washington
and Lee grading system are “in a
bind.”

A self-righteous EC

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I was very disapointed when I
read your editorial on the public
jury in last week's issue. It seems
to me that to blame the public
jury for all the ills in the Honor
System was simplistic at best.

I can agree with your state-
ment that the public jury’s only
duty is to pass judgment on the
cefendant and not upon the abso-
lute penalty. Besides that I must
violently disagree with your every
assumption. It is my belief that it
has been the public jury which
has preserved the integrity of the
Honor System. The only mistake
I have seen a public jury make
was last spring when the jury
admitted that the Honor Code
had been broken but questioned
the defendant's intent. On the
other hand, every other public
trial has demonstrated that the
E.C. is far from infallible. I was
very unhappy to see people will-
ine to convict the defendant in
the most recent trial on the basis
of circumstantial evidence alone.
If only circumstantial evidence
were required for conviction, an
earnest prosecutor could expel
half the school,

I will admit that the public
jury has its faults, but not as
many as the E.C. trial. To the un-
initiated subject of the W&L
Honor Code, the E.C. trial sounds
like a Hollywood version of the
Inquisition but tis serious in its
results. The defendant is kept in
a small room for hours, unable to
hear the testimony against him,
and can be convicted on purely
speculative evidence. The whole
thing is done in secret so as to
protect your reputation, but also
to protect the misplaced public
confidence in the E.C.

It would appear that the E.C.
members have taken their role too
seriously and are becoming too
self-righteous for the public good.
I ‘not being an editor, I cannot
use the royal “we'') question the
premise that a group of twelve
elected students has the ability or
desire te pass a fair verdict in a
secret trial. Is the E.C. so much
more divine than the student
body that it can act fairly and
with justice while twelve mem-
bers of the student body cannot.
I seriously question the editor's
rational instating that the E.C.
has proved itself able to sit in fair
judgment,

Perhaps the better system lies
somewhere in between. Perhaps a
randomly selected jury (with a

Capturing marvelously the suc-
cinct and incisive qualities of
Moliere’s wit, Christopher Hamp-
ton’s translation of Don Juan en-
joyed a rollicking success on its
opening at the University Theat-
re, The wryness of French hu-
mor, which is so often lost in
translation, was there in all its
potency, and Brock Johnson, as
Don Juan, brought it to life.

While portraying a character
who is written to be devilishly
captivating, Mr. Johnson took
matters a step further and made
him intimately so. Utilizing the
smallness of the Troub Theatre
(for once, to a good end), he ad-
dresses his opening remarks con-
cerning his passion for feminine
conquest not only to his perpetu-
ally befuddled valet, Sganarelle
(John Hargrove) and Elvira’s
buffoon-like squire, Guzman
(Brian Garr), but also to various
women in the audience with
whom he establishes direct and
titillating eye contact.

While Don Juan is seducing,
talking about seducing, rebuking
God, etc., Sganarelle is there like
a shadow. A crucial character in
the play, Sganarelle is the “re-
actor’, the foil to Don Juan.
John Hargrove, who has worked
long and hard with the theatre
without landing a major role,
took the character of Sganarelle
and gave him a delightful ef-
fervescence and _ impishness,
while preserving his disbelieving
awe of Don Juan’s callousness.

better touch on the reality of the
Honor Code) conducting a trial
in seeret; or the E.C. conducting
a trial in public; would be better.
But then the defendant may lose
his right to appeal. All I know is
that the present system of justice
here has failed to act with jus-
tice or dispatch, and that your
(the editor's) solution is sheer
folly.

Thomas Rittenburg ‘75

In the EC’s defense

Mr. Rittenburg:

We appreciate your comments,
or at least the fact that you took
the time to seribble them down,
but we find your less than flatter-
ing portrayal of the EC to be
specious at best.

We think it is unfair for you to
accuse the EC of being self-right-
eous. The members of that body
are only attempting to fulfill the
duties of the offices to which
they were elected by the major-
ity vote of your peers. Trials are
held in closed session to protect
the accused and for that reason
alone — not so the EC can pro-
tect its own reputation,

You question whether that
group of students have the abil-
itu and desire to pass a fair ver-
dict in a secret trial. It would ap-
pear obvious that the student
body believes that their elected
representatives have such ability
or they would not have elected
them. Likewise, one must assume
that they have the desire to serve
their peer group in this way or
they would not have taken the
job upon themselves.

We have no magical answers to
the problems that have recently
arisen in connection with the
Honor System. The EC has begun
to examine the situation and we
have faith in its ability to con-
duct an investigative study which
will prove profitable for both the
school and the Honor Code.

Politics—
why are grades

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
With reference to the break-
down of department grades in
last week's “Phi”, an explicative
theory concerning the compara-
tively low grades in politics seems
appropriate. As a senior politics
major I am neither bitter nor sur-
prised that my chances of mak-
ing a “C” in polities are four

“Don Juan”

Miss Parker renders Charlotte
as a Pygmalion-like character
who, despite her horridly unlady-
like laugh, provides no small at-
traction for Don Juan. Her erst-
while fiance Pierrot (Jeff Bird)
comes to defend his claim but is
summarily disposed of. Unfor-
tunately, Mr, Bird indulges in a
bit too much slap-stick in his
scuffling with Don Juan and the
humor of the scene comes off a
bit heavy-handed. The same ob-
jection can be made of Marthu-
rine (Suzanne Carr) in her later
row with Charlotte. Moliere sub-
tlety simply does net warrent
such extreme antics despite the
fact that his genre here is the
farce.

A puzzling but largely success-
ful aspect of Mr. Gordon’s cast-
ing was his use of double and
triple roles. Both Paul Thomp-
son and Hugh Sisson played two
roles, and Brian Garr played
three. While greater crispness of
character might have been a-
chieved through individual ac-

tors playing individual roles, all
three of the gentlemen turned in
good performances. Mr. Thomp-
son, in his first major appear-
ance on stage deserves special
mention for his portrayal of the
diaphanous Doctor Marphurius
and the doughty Don Louis, fath-
er of Don Juan,

As a counterpoint to the pro-
fusion of fools, buffoons and
rakes who populate the stage
throughout the play, Don Juan’s
wife, Elvira (Terry Burtyk) is
virtually the only sombre pre-
sence. Miss Burtyk’s high seri-
ousness is well contrasted with
Mr. DeChristopher’s rendition of
her whimpy brother whose mis-
fortune it is to have to defend her
on the field of honor .

In general, the performance
exuded a carnival-like atmos-
phere, right down to the music
which accompanied it. Moliere is
portraying a topsy-turvy world
in Don Juan and with a stacatto-
like pace, the University Players
give us just that.

times greater than making an
“A” or that my odds of making
an “A” in the fine arts are four
times greater than in politics. I
am only interested in knowing
why this is the case.

Whereas the preponderant
practice in most of the other de-
partments is to grade numeri-
cally, almost all grades given in
politics during the course of a
semester constitute letter evalua-
tions. This is not to say one is
right and the other wrong. It’s
just to say that the very nature
of political science clearly neces-
sitates letter grades and the
vague connotations professors
give them.

In a department where there
are no right or wrong answers it
becomes very difficult to judge
any student's performance as be-
ing excellent ‘(‘A”), because
everything taught in polities is
criticized. Moreover, whereas in
most other departments one's
amount of work can be correlat-
ed to his grade ‘hard work -
high grade), digestion and regur-
gitation or pertinent facts does
not work well in polities courses,
dike it does in science or history,
for example).

Thus, the politics student soon
becomes accustomed to being
pleased upon receiving from his
professor a “Good Job! — C”.

Comments on
Phi’s content

I would like to take this op-
portunity to congratulate man-
aging editor Paul Lancaster on
his fine series of articles concern-
ing erade inflation at Washing-
ton and Lee. This type of report-
ing has long been missing from
The Ring-tum Phi while there is
a definite need for it. These ar-
ticles exposed the average stu-
dent to information to which he
normally would not have been
exposed. I encourage Lancaster
and other Phi reporters to con-
tinue with similar studies of re-
levant topics, Some areas which
might be examined include ex-
penditures of the SAB, functions
of various faculty and student

committees and the
system.

In addition to the above com-
ments, I would like to express my
pleasure at what seems to be a
turn for the better on your part.
Although I may not agree with
the comments expressed therein,
your editorial of last week seems
to indicate that you have finally
decided to address yourself to
serious matters. I hope that you
will continue to do so and that
you will leave the satire to Tra-
veller .

fraternity

Stephen Q. Giblin "77
Mr. Giblin:
in response to your hopes for
the future of the editorial col-
umn, 1 must admit that last week
was only a@ momentary lapse.
With hard work and a stiff up-
per lip we may be able to avoid
addressing ourselves to “serious
matters” or serious people in the
near future.
J LAR,

Letters to the editor are always
welcome provided they are coher-
ent and in good taste. Those who
wish to submit letters should
have them in The Ring-tum Phi
ofifee no later than Monday af-
ternoon, They should be typed

venience of the Print Shop.

Roundballersseek
Sth winner in row

by BILL FLESHER

The cover of the new Wash-
ington and Lee basketball re-
cruiting brochure sports a picture
of Skip Lichtfuss laying in two of
his 1561 career points along with
an exclamation, ‘“W&L Basket-
ball—WHERE WINNING IS A
TRADITION.”

Now the tradition must be con-
tinued without W&L’s fifth all-
time leading scorer, who will play
in Doremus Gym only in future
alumni games.

jut the idea of playing with-
out Lichtfuss and his scoring
ability hasn't crossed Verne Can-
field’s mind.

“To win you have to think
positively,” said the Generals’
head coach, with whom positive
thoughts have become routine
after seven straight winning sea-
sons and a 146-96 career mark in
ten years at W&L.

“To blame our loss of Skip
would be an excuse. What we
have to do is get more scoring
from each position, which we can
do because of what I feel is better
overall balance at each spot,”
Canfield added.

With eight of last season’s ten
regulars returning, plus what
Canfield calis ‘‘a versatility we’ve
never had both on offense and on
defense,” picking up the scoring
punch left by Lichtfuss’ gradua-
tion should not be difficult.

Leading the returnees from
last year’s 13-12 squad are senior
co-captains Guy Kerr and Greg
Groghan, along with senior Bo
Williams and juniors Norm Kris-
toff, Gary Fitzgerald, John Pod-
gajny, Jeff Baum, and Paul Ma-
loney.

Kerr (6'4") and Croghan (6'3’’)
should anchor the forward spots,
with Fitzgerald (6'5") and Baum
(6'4") seeing considerable action
off the bench. In 1973-74, the
forwards garnered an average of
22 points and 17 rebounds a

game.

Canfield will look to Williams
and Podgajny (both 673”)
to hold down the shooting guard
spot, from which 31 points per
game came in 1973-74.

Both compliment each other
well, with Williams an often
deadly shooter from the out-
side, while Podgajny is an ag-
gressive, constantly hustling
player who also has a fine touch
from the middle range. Maloney
returns to occupy the _ point
guard spot along with sophomore
Kim Sims, who moved up to the
varsity late last season. Both are
5'11”, both attended the same
high school (Georgetown Prep,
outside Washington), and are
fine playmakers who can also
handle their own shooting the
Dall.

The lone question mark is at
center, and the puzzle there in-
volves health and not talent.
Kristoff (6’9") proved last sea-
son that he could handle most
everyone he faced, scoring 12
points while adding 11 rebounds
per outing. However, he missed a
good part of the year due to an-
kle injuries, which have plagued
him throughout his career.

Canfield says that this problem
will mean limited duty for Kris-
toff in the early going, until the
center is ready to go full tilt.

WésL 2nd in swim meet

Led by freshman John Hudson,
Washington and Lee's swimming
team placed second to Blooms-
burg State (Pa.) College in the

Millersville Relays Saturday in
Lancaster, Pa.

Swiming in his hometown,
Hudson led W&L to victories and
meet records in three events, the
400- and 800-yard freestyle re-
lays and the crescendo relay.

I-M swim

Freshman Mark Hampton led
EX with wins in the 100-yard in-
dividual medley, the 100-yard
butterfly, and a leg in the win-
ning 200-yard medley relay.

EX also got wins from Hunter
Charbonnet in diving and from
its 200-yard freestyle relay.

Law I's Ralph Lyons scored a
double in the 100- and 200-yard
freestyles.

The 800-yard freestyle relay,
consisting of Hudson, Tad Van
Leer, Will Brotherton, and Rob-
bie Searles, qualified for the Di-
vision III national meet with a
7:39.0 time.

Gary Seldomridge joined Hud-
son, Van Leer, and Brotherton on
the winning 400-yard relay team,
3:25.0.

Hudson, Brotherton, Seldom-
ridge, Searles, Alan Pettigrew,
David Winge, and Peter Meem
made up the winning crescendo
relay, an event in which all four
strokes were swum,

Hudson's 500-yard freestyle leg
of 4:46.5 would have placed se-
cond in last year's national meet.

W&L opens its 1974 dual meet
season tomorrow at 7 p.m. against
state power Virginia Common-
wealth. Saturday the Generals
host Madison at 2 p.m.

Both meets will be in the new
pool.

Generals
‘miss’ in

74 finale

by BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s disap-
pointment-filled football season
ended in heartbreak Saturday
when a 32-yard field goal at-
tempt by freshman Phil Bailey
with five seconds left failed, giv-
ing Washington (Mo.) Univer-
sity’s Bears a 10-8 win before a
Sparse gathering at Wilson
Field.

The Generals, who closed the
year with a 1-8-1 mark, had set
up the field-goal attempt with a
drive from their own 33 to the
Bears’ 15 in the final two min-
utes. After the teams exchanged
penalties, Bailey, who had never
tried a placement in a game be-
fore, left his kick short and to
the left.

Earlier Bailey had missed a 37-
yard attempt.

It was a field goal that even-
tually made the difference in the
final outcome. Washington’s Ken
King made a 37-yarder in the se-
cond quarter, which at the time
gave the Bears a 3-0 lead.

Washington upped their lead
to 10-0 four plays into the fourth
quarter when quarterback Mike
Karaffa scored on a nine-yard
run. King added the conversion.

The Generals narrowed the
gap with 6:41 remaining when
freshman running back Raynard
Scott flared out of the backfield
grabbed a pass from quarterback
Jack Berry, and sped up the side-
line 61 yards for a touchdown. A
two-point conversion pass from
Berry to John Moore narrowed
the gap to 10-8.

W&L got the ball back on the
ensuing kickoff. Bailey tried an
onside kick, which hit at the
Generals’ 45 and then bounced
. . . backwards. A Washington
player tried to fal lon the ball
but couldn't hold on, and Charlie
Brown recovered at the W&L 39.

Four plays later the Generals

Meaningful grades?

(Continued from Page 2)

'vhe faculty brought up the dis-
cussion of grades at a meeting
earlier this year, as the Courses
and Degrees Committee hoped to
alleviate the problems inherent
in this schism between university
policy and practice. The discus-
sion was tabled; no further ac-
tion has been taken.

Thus, the university policy ex-
ists, and the university practice
exists, but the two are not living
in peaceful co-existence. Simple
as that. Yet ,the university, the
faculty, or the students them-
selves have not taken a serious
iook of late into the anomoly be-
tween preaching and practicing.
individual professors are fighting
between adherence to university
policy or adherence to university-
wide uniformity. And, as a result,
neither is being achieved.

Next issue—A look at options
to the grading system at Wash-
ington and Lee.

When Kristoff is rested, cither
Fitzgerald or sophomores Don
Berlin (6’8”) or Steve Hand (6’-

6") will fill the post.

Again Canfield plans to have
a special “Aggressors” squad to
be used in pressing situations.
Baum, Hand, Sims, Steve Out-
law, and Chris Larson make up
the unit which Canfield hopes
“will give our regulars a rest and
hopefully shake things up a bit
on the court,”

W&L has a 26-game schedule,
which features battles against
University Division teams Vir-
ginia (at Charlottesville on Dec.
2) and Navy, and college division
powers Roanoke, Old Dominion,
Madison, Baltimore University,
and Randolph-Macon.

“Tt’s a schedule which means
that each player has to play up
to his ability and then some,”
Canfield said. ‘We can do this;
we have shown it in practice. The
question is, can we find that little
bit extra when we have to?”

All the questions will be an-
swered soon, beginning with a
Tip-off Tournament in Doremus
Gym a week from tomorrow
against Maryville College. Hamp-
den-Sydney hosts Frostburg
State in the other game.

The Generals and Tigers swap
opponents the following night.
