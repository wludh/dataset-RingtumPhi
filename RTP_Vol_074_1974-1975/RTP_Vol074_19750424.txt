Vol. LXXIV _

y ROBERT LUTZ

On Friday night, April 25th,
the Student Activities Board
opens its spring social calendar
with a concert featuring one of
Motown’'s hottest and most dur-
able groups, the fabulous Four
‘Tops.

Founded in 1954 by Abdul Fa-
kir, Levi Stubbs, Renaldo Ben-
son, and Lawrence Paxton, the
band gained national promi-
hence and popularity through
the release of such hits as “I
Can’t Help Myself,’ “Baby, I
Need Your Loving,’ and “Same
Old Song.” The Tops have been
described as ‘‘Motown’s Number
1 recording group” and have ap-
peared twice previously at W&L,
last in 1968 and once in 1966,
when they headlined the Open-
ings Weekend “Motown Sound”
concert. Few groups have enjoy-
ed such widespread and lasting

Lectures, piano
recital here

by the Phi News Staff

Lee Chapel and duPont Audi-
torium will be put to good use in
the coming week, as a number of
lectures and other events will be
held.

Tonight in duPont Auditorium
a lecture will be presented by Dr.
George Borgstom of Michigan
State University. Borgstrom’s ad-
dress is entitled, “Food: The Glo-
bal Crisis.’ Sponsored by the
Economics Department and the
University Center in Virginia,
his appearance here should in-
terest anyone concerned about
the Malthusian spectre of mass
starvation. He is one of the fore-
most experts in world food pro-
duction and its relationship with
the ever-increasing world popu-
lation. Borgstrom will also ap-
pear in the Interdepartmental
course on the Human Population
Problem.

Also to be held tonight is a
piano recital in Lee Chapel. The
students of Charles Markley, a
local piano instructor, will per-
form pieces ranging from quite
clementary etudes to a Beethoven
sonata, The recital is open to the
public; the program will begin at
8 p.m.

popularity, either at W&L or
anywhere else.

Appearing with the Four Tops
wil be Les Variations, a French-
Moroccan group which has been
described, appropriately enough,
as “France’s Number 1 recording
group.” While probably unfami-
liar to most W&L students, Les
Variations are very popular in
Europe and have performed with
such noteworthies as Paul Mc-
Cartney, Jimi Hendrix, Cream,
the Who, and the Stones. The
group sings in English, and their
sound, according to Rolling Stone
magazine, is “solid exciting rock
music with an exotic twist.”

Opening Friday's concert will
be Lady Luck, billed as (get
ready) “Virginia’s Top New
Group.” The show begins at 8:00
P.M. in Old Doremus, with tic-
kets modestly priced at $4.50 in
advance and $5.00 at the door.

This spring’s University Grain
Party, sponsored by the junior
class, is scheduled for Saturday,
May 10. According to class presi-
dent Gary Seldomridge, the deci-
sion to make May 9-11 Springs
Weekend was made before it be-
came apparent that the Four
‘Tops would be unable to perform
here that weekend. Thus the Uni-
versity will now have two big
party weekends this spring. It is
still unclear whether or not SAB
wil have a big-name band in
town on May 9, and whether the
junior class party will be held in
Red Square or at Zollman’s Pa-
villion.

Othello, The Tempest
Two spring plays

By JESS REEVES

While many departments do
not fully utilize the opportunity
presented by the Spring Term,
Drama 139, Total Theatre, makes
the most of every minute afford-
ed it by a six-week period. Those
who join the spring troupe at the
Troubadour Theatre find that
they sacrifice a great deal of
time, in excess of eight hours a
day, to their muse, but the re-
ward of six credits and success-
ful productions help to compen-
sate for the many hours spent in
the woefully inadequate drama
acility.

Total Theatre is nothing if not

ambitious, and this year’s pro-
gram is one of the most ambiti-
ous yet. The Troubadours will
present two major productions at
the end of the term, The Tempest
and Othello. The productions of
each play will be on alternating
nights in the last week. In addi-
tion, an adaptation of The Tem-
pest for children's theatre will be
performed at various schools in
the region,

Professor Lee Kahn is direct-
ing Othello, in which Paul Mor-
ella plays the lead role. The cast
also includes Brock Johnson as
Iago, Megan Morgan as Desde-
mona, Mary Ann Naber as Bian-

then takes appropriate action on
the offender. The Curriculum
Committee is responsible for re-
viewing the curriculum of the
University and preparing the
semi-annual curriculum surveys.
It also collects student opinion
and views on the academic en-
vironment at W&L

The Student Activities Board
provides social, cultural and rec-
reational activities aimed at the
needs and interests of the stu-

It is not

surprising that seniors have little interest in hearing every-

\ssociation to introduce senior class,

thing you always wanted to know about stencils, and we sus-
pect that the banquet would be more readily appreciated as a

gesture than as an appeal and indoctrination period, If the
seniors have taken the banquet less than seriously, this is

probably not completely their fault,

There really is not a praticularly strong reason for can-
celling the banquet rather than reforming it, unless, of course,
those people making the decision felt that the situation was
hopeless. We hope that efforts will be made to revive the
feel that it
offers a valuable opportunity for the seniors to gather as a

senior banquet by some group of people, as we
group for the last time before graduation,

This proposal originated with John Kelly Jennings of the
Department of Journalism and Communications,

Whereas there have been periodic protests at the apparent
wastefulness of the policy under which Washington and
Lee seniors are required to rent caps and gowns for a
couple of hours at graduation; and

Whereas the justification for that policy has been that (1)
an identity in costume helps erase personal distinctions
among men who are receiving a common degree, and
(2) the common costume reflects time-honored academ-
ic tradition:

This proposal would satisfy every concern, and would have
some additional advantages never before available to the uni-
versity and to the graduates. The costume would, of course,
continue to be identical (a referendum open to every degree
candidate could be held to choose among Porcelain butterfly,
Porcelain Medallion and Porcelain Garden, and the results of
the vote would be binding). Educational tradition would be
respected more than ever, graduates would resemble in
dress the statue of George Washington atop the Centre Build
ing, and what could possibly be more traditional at Washing-
ton and Lee than that? Instead of having to return the cos-
tume after commencement, graduates would have for al-
most exactly the same cost And

the university would receive $76.50 in royalties from the sale

Phi Food Editor
Lexington has everything to

offer the tourist, e.g., scenic land-
scapes, battlegrounds, historic
sites, and famous institutions. It
also has some pretty remarkable
restaurants which cannot be
categorized by anything other
than the fact that they are all in
Lexington and the food all tastes
very much alike. The hamlet does
not offer Continental cuisine or
any of the standard menus that
one would like to expect in a
place of such quiet elegance. In
fact, the only facility which
shows a single-minded concen-
tration on one type of food is
The China House. However, there
once was a parting glimpse of
gastronomic glory known as the
A.L.B. Corner Grill which de-
serves to be remembered here
post mortem.

If you have been wondering
why all the best people in Lex-
ington—Grit Man, Donkey Wo-
man, Skinny Doc, Ant Queen,
and all the others who make the
town social roster read like a
Who’s Who in American Rank-
ness and Dereliction — have been
in mourning for the past week, it
is a result of the untimely demise
of the Corner Grill, This brilli-
ant meeting place of the local
gentry and intelligensia has
closed its doors for the last time,
or so it would appear from the
looks of the main dining room.
Some stalwart hopefuls insist on
suggesting that The Corner Grill
has only been closed temporarily
for the staff and interior to re-

ceive a long-overdue grease and
lub job, and, truthfully, we had
noticed the slick of the kitchen
grill wearing thin in spots upon
out last visit to the fashionable
Lexington bistro.

The Corner Grill was always
proud of its preeminent position
on the culinary scene of the
Shenandoah Valley. Its patrons
and management used to call ita
“teaching” restaurant, as Wash-
ington and Lee is called a ‘‘teach-
ing” institution. The lovely pro-
prietress was often known to
grunt coquettishly to a newcom-
er who had just ordered his first
Corner Grill cheeseburger a la
mode, “That'll teach ya!” and,
of course, after spending six
hours worshipping at the porce-
lain altar the late, famous Saint
Martin of Tours, most people un-
derstood that which the Corner
Grill was trying to teach them,
i.e., don’t come back.

The Grill did have a great deal
in common with the fashionable
grills in London like the Savoy
Grill, especially in its Edwardian
styie of interior decoration. Al-
though the main dining room
features Classical indirect light-
ing and rich, English pine panel-
ing, there are elements here of
prehistoric Lexington and the
primitive era, ca.1900. A touch of
class was added to the stylish
chiseled fixtures of the Corner
Grill with its prints of Indian
braves taken trom Walt Disney's
comic book oi scenes from the
massacre of the holy innocents.
Naturally, most of the highly
sophisticated clientele chose to

Letter To The Editor

Law man tells his side

on closed party issue
To the Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

I wish to clarify for your read-
ers the circumstances surround-
ing the Law School's Nassau
Party on April 12, where two un-
dergraduate students were asked
by me to leave. I would like also
to assure the undergraduate stu-
dents that the incident was not
in pursuance to any organized ef-
fort to exclude undergraduates
from Law School parties gener-
ally.

The incident arose, I believe,
because of the special nature of
the Party, the way it was funded,
and the peculiarly irritating and
deceitful attitude of one of the
students toward me at the Party.
Moreover, like you, I cannot un-
derstand why any undergraduate
would want to come to Law
School parties in the first place
either; it's always more enjoy-
able to drive a car through a
building, intimidate the band, or
intentionally destroy the electri-
cal system, as was done by one of
your number at our Christmas
party last December. In addition
to boring, Law School parties are
unfortunately poorly funded.
These drawbacks influenced the
Social Committee of the Law
School to make this party closed
to all but those law students,
staff and faculty who bought tic-
kets. Let me make clear to you
that if a law student did not buy
a ticket, he or she would also
have been asked to leave. Each
ticket-purchaser paid $5.00 per
couple for admittance, which en-

titled him or her to a chance to
win a trip to Nassau or about 75

merchants. We wanted to sell
such tickets only to law students
to insure that they receive these
presents. We felt that whatever
excitement the whole thing gen-
erated would have been lost if
nobody knew who the winners
were.

Second, we simply cannot af-
ford to buy liquor for the entire
student body. The Nassau Party
is “open bar” and liquor was
bought to accommodate only
about 350 people; this alone cost
over $450, and we could not af-
ford to plan an open bar party
for even 20 more people, much
less 1200. I understand that the
students had brought their own,
and that they probably used only
that; but if it were largely known
that this one party were open,
less discreet drinkers would take
advantage, Where our parties are
BYO, neither I nor any law stu-
dent has any objection to under-

case at our Christmas party, and
any of our other parties.

As I understand it, you have
“closed” parties from time to
time, occasioned probably by rea-
sons not unlike those I've tried to
outline here. I therefore hope
that at least some undergradu-
ates understand why ours had to
be this one time.

Some undergraduate students
were in fact present at the Party,

that occurred, and why the two

DEAR TRAVELLER—I am just sick to death of all the crumby in-
tra-mural offerings here at Washington and Lee When will those
blockheads in charge of the program get on the stick and come up
with something fun to do? Please light a fire under these people
and give them a few of your intelligent suggestions for improv-
ing the intra-mural program.

(Signed) Lady Treece

DEAR TREECE—Granted, intra-murals at W&L are not the most
exciting thing on two knees in this or any other season. However,
much could be done to make the program more interesting and
relevant for the student body. The best way to add new life in
this area is to add new and challenging sports in which students
may participate. Some of the sports which might be included are:

-—-Whips and Chains. The University should willingly provide
instruments of torture/pleasure for those students who get their
thrills in somewhat kinky ways. Students would be allowed to pair
up into sado-masochism teams, and the sadist drawing the most
blood at ten feet with either the whip or the chain would win the
trophy for his fraternity. Wouldn't that be a nice trophy to dis-
play in he house on Parents’ Weekend?

—Fun with Leather. The Art Department should sponsor this
sport in which there would be a timed competition to determine
who can tool the fastest in leather and who can weave the big-
gest straw basket.

—Oregy. This contest would give all the houses a chance to
prove their endurance in comparison to other houses. Of course,
the competition would be closed to all girls except the mesdames
from Southern Sem. Each fraternity could be given a roped-off
section of Wilson Field, and the group which was able to sustain
its activity without brake for the longest period of time would
win the special prize — free tickets to see “The Life and Times of
Xaxiera Hollander.”

—Program Competition. Each player would be handed one

Defending champion Hampton
Institute is an
favorite to repeat,
Washington and Lee will be a
strong contender in the Virginia
College Athletic Association
(VCAA) tennis championships
here this weekend.

The Hampton collegians swept
all nine places last year and
boast one of the best college ten-
nis teams in the country.

Washington and Lee’s dual

meet record now stands at 12-6 f

following receent meets with
Virginia Tech (won 5-4), Navy
(lost 8-1), George Washington
(won 6-3), William and Mary
(won 6-3), and Richmond (lost
7-2).

Washington and Lee won six
events but dropped a 90-55 deci-
sion in track last week to Lynch-
bure College. Winning for the
Generals were Tony Perry with a
6-4 high jump, Paul Thomson in
the mile (4:31.1), Steve Schwei-
zerhof with a 42-foot shot put,
Barclay Armstrong with a 21-6
long jump, John Tucker with a

52.0 in the 440-yard dash, and
Tem Washington with a 15:59.1
in the three-mile run,

The Generals also competed
last week in the Virginia State
Meet, where the 440-yard relay
team placed fifth with a :44.2
clocking, Schweizerhof was fifth
in the shot with a 43-2 heave,
and Thomson was sixth in the
mile with a 4:19.7 time, just a
tenth of a second off his school
record,

Washington and Lee's baseball
team played perhaps its best
same of tne year last Sunday be-
jore a large crowd which includ-
ed NBC sportscaster Joe Gara-
giola, who was doing a documen-
tary on college baseball. The
Generals lost a 1-0 heartbreaker
in the first game of a double-
header, filmed by NBC Sports
camera crew, and also dropped

the second game, 13-8, to Old
Dominion.
The NBC feature on college

baseball, which will include some
of the W&L-ODU game, is tenta-
tively scheduled to be aired June

9 on Garagiola’s “Baseball
World” series preceding the
Monday night Game-of-the-
Week.

The double loss to ODU, coupl-
ed with an 11-1 setback to Madi-
son earlier, left the Generals with
a 2-16 season mark. The Gen-
erals will have a chance at re-
venge Tuesday when they travel
to Madison, and will be host to
undefeated Lynchburg College on
Friday, beginning at 3:00 p.m.
on W&L's Smith Field.

The fun, if one could call it
that, ended this past weekend as
W&L dropped a 14-9 exhibition
to powerful Maryland Lacrosse
Club on Saturday, then waltzed
past North Carolina State’s in-
experienced Wolfpack, 19-4, the

The Generals played at North

that could have ended the Tar

three goals to lead the Chesa-
peake L.C. to a 14-10 exhibition
win over the Generals.

Saturday it was John Lalley,
one of Bauer's running mates at
midfield last year, who got the
hat trick to lead Maryland L.cC.
to its 14-9 win in another exhibi-
tion.

Lalley, himself a recipient of
All-American mention in 1972,
scored one of four straight goals
that gave MLC a 4-1 lead.

W&L twice came back to with-

lead. While the Generals con-

several of the spectacular
iety,

W&L’s attack trio of Rob Mor-
gan, Don Carroll, and Dave War-
field did almost all of the Gen-
erals’ scoring. Morgan had four
goals and an assist, Carroll con-
tributed three goals, and War-
field added a goal and four as-
sists. Ken Miller got the other
W&L goal.

What proved to be the Gen-
erals’ downfall was an inability
to cash in on extra man situa-
tions. W&L scored on only one of
eleven extra-man opportunities,
while MLC cashed in three of six
times.

var-

* * +.

W&L's scoring slump continu-
ed the next day against North
Carolina State, even though the
fact of 19 Generals’ goals
wouldn't indicate that to be the
case,

More often than not W&L at-
tackmen and midfielders were
beating their defenders with a
variety of moves and fakes, but
when it came time to shoot the
ball would go wide, hit a pipe, or
not go at all.

 

Md. club

Of 76 total shots, 19 found the
back of the net for W&L goals,
another 25 were credited as ‘‘sav-
ed by goalies’’ and the rest were
of the “close but...” type.

Again the attackmen did most
of the scoring. Warfield had four
goals, Morgan added three, while
Carroll, Boyd Martin, and Jim
Englehart each had a pair of
goals.

Freshman midfielders Brian
Tray and Mark Derbyshire each
had two goals, while classmates
Scott Baugher and Jay Sindler
scored one apiece.

The highlight of an otherwise
average game was the Generals
surviving a situation in which
four players were serving penal-
ties, including goalie Malcolm
Hastings,

Freshman Charlie Brown, who
has been seeing time at midfield
in recent games, returned to the
goal in the penalty situation,
stopped State’s lone shot, and
then ran out the time on two of
of the penalties.

It made things exciting on an
otherwise ho-hum afternoon.

DEAR TRAVELLER — I recall reading in some magazine in the au-

number of gray squirrels (L. graius sciurus). What happened to
them all — I wanted to invite them as featured guests at a bio-
logy seminar this spring?

DEAR EMMONS — Fear not, the furry little woodland creatures
have not left the historic back campus permanently; they have
temporarily moved across Wood's Creek and have been signed up
as construction workers in the apartment complex, where they
carry nails and steel beams way up to the workmen on the second
floor.

imagine an order of
22,000 priests and brothers in
73 countries around the world.
(That's a pretty big family.)

But that's what the
Salesians of St. John Bosco
are all about — a large family
of community-minded men
dedicated to the service of *
youth. (And no one gets lost.)

In Italy in the 1800's a chance meeting between a poor
priest and a street urchin served to create a movement of such
success that it is still growing today. Don Bosco became the
priest who brought youth back from the streets — and
back to God.

He reasoned that a program of play, learn and pray would
make useful citizens of the world. He crowded out evil with
reason, religion and kindness in a (what was then unheard of)
atmosphere of family.

The ideals of St. John Bosco are still with us today. His
work goes on in boys clubs, technical and academic schools
guidance centers, summer camps and missions. And his very
human approach is very evident in the family spirit of the
Salesians. This is the way he wanted it. This is the way it is.
The Salesian experience isn't learned — it's lived,

Many lecturers here this week

(Continued from page 1)
next week as participants in a
professional institute on medical
ethics.

The institute is scheduled in
conjunction with a course in
medical ethics inquiring into the
difficult decisions physicians are
called on to make regarding
abortion, death and dying pati-
ents, experimentation on hu-
mans, genetic manipulation, and
even “health as a human right.”

During the three-day institute,
the physicians wil work with stu-
dents enrolled in the course both
in and out of formal classroom
settings. Six seminars have been
scheduled during the three days
to enable both students and doc-

Two plays in rehearsal

will be made in the set to give
the whole a lighter, more whim-
sical atmosphere than will be the
case for the production of Ot-
hello, John Hollinger will play
Ferdinand while Mary Ann Na-
ber plays Miranda with Dave
DeChristopher as Prospero,
Brock Johnson as Alonzo, Paul
Richards as Caliban, with Don
Hogle as Ariel, and sixteen mem-
bers of the spring company will
assume roles for the production.
Mr. DeChristopher will provide
an adaptation of The Tempest
for presentation as children’s
theatre in 10 - 12 performances
at schools from Roanoke to
Brownsburg. This play will run
45 minutes, and will include
much the same cast employed in
the Shakespeare play.

Total Theatre enjoys a seven-
teen person company which in-
cludes two females this year. All
members of the company are
either actors in the plays or as-
sistants in other fields of produc-
tion. Thus, in its fifth year Total
Theatre is still working ardu-
ously within the severe limita-
tions which it faces at Washing-
ton and Lee and doing a remark-
ably good job as an educational
theatre,

tors “to wrestle, through the case
method, pressing issues confront-
ing the medical profession.”

Dr. Irving S. Cooper, neuro-
surgeon at St. Barnabas Hospi-
tal in New York, will deliver a
public lecture and direct three of
the seminars. Other seminars
will be conducted by Dr. Louis W.
Hodges, professor of religion at
W&L and director of the univer-
sity’s pre-professional ethics pro-
grams, which include journalism
and law in addition to medicine.

Richard D. Obenshain, Co-
Chairman of the Republican Na-
tional Committee, will speak on
Tuesday, April 29, The speech
will take place in room 114 of the
Student Center, and will start at
8 p.m. Obenshain’s address is be-
ing sponsored by the W&L Re-
publicans and is open to the pub-
lic. His speech will deal with the
problems and dangers inherent
in big government and the stance
of the Republican Party on the
topic.

On ‘Thursday, May 1, the
Young Americans for Freedom
will sponsor a speech by M. Stan-
ton Evans, journalist and author,
in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

A one-man exhibition of art by
a Lexington senior at W&L will
take place April 28 through May
4 in the university's duPont Gal-
lery.

The show will feature the work
of Anthony M. Murray, who will
be graduated next month from
W&L wiih a major in art. Murray
is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Waltcr
N. Murray ot Lexington.

The public is invited to view
the show — the first in a series
of four week-long exhibitions by
W&L art majors this spring —
weekdays from 8 to 4, There is
no charge.

Next Wednesday and Thurs-
day, a British art historian and
staff member of the Victoria and
Albert Museum, Helen Lowen-
thal, will deliver lectures in du-
Pont Auditorium. The Wednes-
day lecture, “Fantastics in Euro-
pean Gardens,” begins at 7 p.m,

were asked to leave. Those pre-
sent either had a law student
buy a ticket for them in the law
student's name ‘unbeknownst to
the ticket-sellers), or otherwise
obtained a ticket. The two stu-
dents involved had no ticket and
ignored my requests at the door
to produce one. When one of the
two came back some time later to
explain to me why he ought to
stay, I told him why the party
was closed and asked him to
leave; he got upset and, among
others, threatened to leave. About
an hour later, I found him at the
bar again and asked him to leave.
For the manner I acted on that
occasion I apologize, as I did to
him and his date as they left.
Before he left, though, he tried
to steal a bottle of Jack Daniels
on the prize table at the door,
and two law students are pre-
pared to identify the student,
should that be necessary. Perhaps
had I been less hassled and more
perfectly sober, the incident may
-_

 

not have arisen. In any event,
those events surrounding this
particular individual caused his
being asked to leave; I was un-
able to fashion a more rational
approach to him under the cir-
cumstances. That is my fault,
and not a Law School policy to-
ward undergraduates generally.

I am sorry that the incident
has grown to the stature requir-
ing your editorial comment, I
hope the undergraduate students
can understand why this Party
was closed. We are faced together
with a rather bleak social en-
vironment in Lexington, and it
would be worse an atmosphere if
we two social lions turned on
each other. We certainly do not
want to have this incident force
the communication gap between
us any wider than it evidently
has become.

Sincerely,

Grady C. Frank
Social Committee of the
Law School

Mayor proclaims ROTC Week

Lexington Mayor Charles F.
Phillips, Jr., has proclaimed
April 21 through 27 ROTC Week
in Lexington.

“In so doing I am endorsing
the action of Virginia Governor
Mills E. Godwin, Jr. who pre-
viously declared the week of
April 21 to 27 to be ROTC Week
in Virginia,” declared Mayor
Phillips.

Governor Godwin’'s proclama-
tion recognized that ROTC “gra-
duates of the program have prov-
ed themselves again and again
in defense of the nation.”

The city of Lexington is some-
what fortunate to have two maj-
or universities, W&L and V.M.I.,

both of which offer ROTC pro-
grams,

For Army ROTC particularly,
this proclamation of ROTC
Week is very timely, coming on
the heels of April 19, the two
hundredth anniversary of the
“shot heard round the world”
and arriving in 1975, the Army’s
bicentennial year.

NOTICE

Petitions for candidacy for the
University Council are due in the
E.C, room by 7 p.m. Monday
night, April 28. All candidates
should be at the E.C. meeting at
that time. Petitions must be
signed by 50 students.

alas, will be unknown to future
