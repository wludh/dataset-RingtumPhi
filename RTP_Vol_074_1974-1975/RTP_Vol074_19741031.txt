Coeducation committee
appointed by new rector

A four-member committee has
been named by the rector of
Washington and Lee University’s
board of trustees to continue the
board's study of coeducation and
its consequences.

The board has been examining
the question of whether Wash-
ington and Lee should admit
women to its undergraduate di-
visions—and what the consequ-
ences would be if it did—for more
than five years. The action taken
by E. Marshall Nuckols Jr., the

newly clected rector, pinpoints
the responsibility for carrying
out that long-range study in a
specific committee.

Chairman of the
committee is Frank C. Brooks,
a Baltimore insurance’ broker.
Serving with him are Joseph T.
Lykes Jr. of Metarie, La., presi-
dent of Lykes-Youngstown Corp.,
H. Gordon. Leggett Jr. of Lynch-
burg, manager of personnel and
public relations for Leggett De-
partment Stores, and Dr. Edgar

Amendment would help

state’s private schools

SPECIAL TO THE PHI

Washington and Lee has a big
stake in the way Virginians vote
Nov. 5 on the statewide referen-
dum question about an amend-
ment to the Virginia constitu-
tion’s provisions for higher ed-
ucation.

Administrators
and one inmate
on prison forum

A panel discussion on Vir-
ginia’s corrections system, led
by four prison and rehabilita-
tion administrators and one in-
mate, will take place Monday at
7 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

The panel, titled “After Trial

Before Release,” is sponsored
iointly by Washington and Lee's
Interfraternity Council, the stu-
dent government Executive Com-
mittee, the University Federa-
tion, and the Lexington Jaycees.

Chairman of the program is
Paul McE. Fleming, a W&L sen-
ior. Panelists will be Charles F.
Vol{fe, deputy director of the
state Department of Correction;
Louis Wayne Moore, institutional
rehabilitation supervisor at the
Virginia State Penitentiary; Sue
lL. Kennedy, treatment program
supervisor at the penitentiary;
Robert DeLisie, administrative
assistant to the penitentiary sup-
erindendent, and Jim Clements

an inmate and former presi-
dent of the Spring Street Jay-
cces.

The ballot question asks a yes
or no vote as to whether the
constitution should be amended
to permit the legislature to make
grants to Virginia residents who
want to attend private colleges
in Virginia. Coupled to this pro-
vision is another that would per-
mit contracts for educational
services between private colleges
and various state and local gov-
ernments and their agencies, in-
cluding public colleges and uni-
versities.

According to a W&L spokes-
man, the measure is a refine-
ment of existing constitutional
provisions that provide for grants
and loans to students going to
tax-supported institutions but
only loans for Virginians wishing

to attend Virginia private col-
leges.
The part of the amendment

dealing with contracts for educa-
tional services could mean greater
cooperation between Virginia
Military Institute and W&L, the
W&L spokesman points out. Only
informal cooperation has been
possible under existing law.

Approval of the amendment
would be an important step in
helping narrow the tuition gap,
according to the W&L spokes-
man.

‘Private college costs have al-
ways run higher than expenses
at public institutions,” he points
out, “and private colleges are not
trying to bring about equaliza-
tion through state assistance. All
we hope to achieve is a restora-
tion of the acceptable difference,
a workable balance between tul-
tion levels in the public and pri-

vate sectors.’

SAC meets with UC;
conduct proposal slated

The Student Affairs Commit-
tee will go before the University
Council tonight to present a
“standards of conduct” proposal.
rhe committee, which functions
as an appeal body for the stu-
dent, is recommending that the
UC adopt a statement as to what
tudent organization handles
which discipline and the extent
of its power to do so.

The “standards of conduct” to
be presented tonight at the
meeting are of no great consequ-
enee according to Student Body
President Ben Bailey. In his
words they are not too much
more than a “rewording of last
vear's standards

The trustees’ interest in con-
tinuing the study of coeduca-
tion was expressed at the May
mecting of the board when mem-
bers authorized the rector to
name a committee with responsi-
bility for “fact-finding.” The
board declared that the fact of
the ongoing study was not to be
interpreted as an indication that
it either favored or opposed co-
education.

At the time the committee was
authorized last May, the board
expected that it would make its
report at an early point in the
current academic year. The sub-
sequent illness and death of Ross
L. Malone, then rector, delayed
the appointment of a committee
until the board's October meet-
ing.

OUTLOOK and REVIEW.

...and by their bathroom walls
Ye shall know them

—Whipple’s Baby

For years campus politicos and Washington Hallites have
been frantically searching for a single, valid satistic or measure
by which they can gauge the student body, For example, a
curriculum committee wants to find out student reaction to
different courses and teachers and the academic calender, A
dean wants to learn how transfer students are faring in their
first year at Washington and Lee. The Athetic Department
senses a falling off in student support and wants to find an
answer (as if that is not obvious with their records), There
is indeed one eternal standard by which all these various facets
of student life can be accurately placed in their proper per-
spective—grafliti.

We hope this assertion will not offend the sensibilities of
some of our more refined readers who are unaccustomed to
looking to a bathroom wall for great insights into our civiliza-
tion. We do, however, believe that even the most common
latrine partition can be turned into a work of art which would
certainly dazzle Neanderthal man in comparison with his
own cave art and would facinate the duPont masters for much
the same reason.

This type of expression is obviously one which intrigues
the student a great deal. In fact, the art has been so widely
diffused throughout the student body that the walls of its
proudest galleries must be scrubbed down several times each
year when the graffiti becomes so thick that new additions are
impossible to read.

The acme of this ancient art form can be found on the
second floor of McCormick Library in the music wing. Here
are inscribed words of wisdom and gems of knowledge which
would be the pride of any poet or scholar, On the walls of
this Bohemian retreat live the deeds of faculty and students
alike, side by side, limerick to limerick,

In this hallowed gallery the words of Joe Lyles are im-
mortalized next to a recounting of who has the latest and
most fashionable diseases.

Besides the artistic value of these clever graffiti, they have
a practical side which should prove beneficial for those who
would desire to feel the pulse of the school. We might recom-
mend that Dean John inspect these writings every Friday to
keep up with youth in the same way that we are sure Murph
does. President Huntley might do well to go over to Me-
Cormick or even the Commerce School to learn the latest
smut that is being fabricated about him.

Just think—printed course evaluation questionnaires could
become a thing of the past if only those in charge would spend
more time enjoying the living word of Washington and Lee.

The Admissions Office could make use of this student
forum in reeruiting and selecting candidates. Dean Farrar
could take a prospective student to any gentleman's lounge
and give him thirty seconds to add his own graffiti, Based
on this demonstration of the lad’s mental quickness, second-
floor Washington Hall would have a solid foundation on
which to make its selections of those candidates to be invited
to join us. We feel that this foolproof method would certainly
be preferable to the method now being utilized—which is
something like pin the tail on the donkey.

We only wish to point out that the W&L civilization is
plastered all over the vertical surfaces of countless rooms on
this campus and that no one has taken advantage of this
wealth of information. Remember, graffiti is both a spectator
and a participant sport. To ignore either of these aspects of
the art is to receive less than a liberal arts education, With-
out grafitti the brilliant culture we have nurtured in this place
will be forgotten in the future and mankind will be completely
unaware of the way we were, A graffito a day to the glory
of the school is the very least we can do!

A tradition resurrected

We would like to take this opportunity to applaud the
reinstitution of worship services in Lee Chapel, The resur-
rection of this tradition can be attributed to the efforts of
Clay Jackson and David Pittman, along with the other mem-
bers of the Lee Chapel Worship Committee, This accomplish-
ment is due completely to the interest of a few students who
felt called upon to honor the memory of General Lee in a very
special way.

For this concern and respect for the proud traditions of
Washington and Lee, we believe recognition and appreciation

Are grades getting higher?

By PAUL LANCASTER

Managing Editor

Editor’s note—This is the first in
a series of articles on grading at
Washington and Lee. This week,
The Ring-tum Phi managing
editor Paul J. Lancaster investi-
gates the topic of grade inflation.

In 1967-69, the average under-
graduate senior at Washington
and Lee University was gradu-
ated with a 2.597 grade point
ratio. Last May, the average un-
dergraduate senior won his de-
gree with a 2.761 GPR.

In 1967-68, 15.6 percent of all
grades awarded to undergradu-
ates at Washington and Lee were
grades of ‘A’’. Last year, 22.6 per-
cent of all grades were grades
oe".

The terminology being tossed
around the campus in reference
to this rise in GPR’s and per-
centages of “A” marks is ap-
propriate to the times. The term-
inology is “grade inflation.”

And, that terminology is being
tossed around the campus more
this year than ever before. Grade
inflation is becoming a favorite
topic of the faculty committee
on Courses and Degrees, and it
has also been discussed in the
monthly faculty meetings and in
the monthly meetings of the stu-
dent-faculty forum, the Univer-
sity Council.

Certainly, grade inlation is not
peculiar to Washington and Lee.

In fact, the rate of grade infla-
tion at Washington and Lee is
lower than the national rate.
The net rise in the GPR at Wash-
ington and Lee from 1966-67 to
1973-74 has been .231. The net
rise nationally in that same
period of time is approximately
.298, according to The Chronicle
of Higher Education.

The Oct. 7 issue of The Chron-
icle of High Education quotes
results of a national study con-
ducted by Arvo E. Juola, acting
director of evaluation services at
Michigan State University. The
study investigates grade infla-
tion at nearly 200 colleges across

He does, however, offer other
suggestions.

On possibility, Juola says, is
what he calls a “readjustment
from the rather harsh grading
standards adopted during the
post-Sputnik period.” The
Chronicle of Higher Education
also says Juola thinks schools
were trying to limit enrollment
in the early 1960's.

Another possibility suggested
in the study is a general shift
in student-faculty relationships
caused by increasing student
activism in the 60's. Juola sug-
gests that student demonstra-
tions may have led to making

the student now has fewer credits
with which to contend during the
fall and winter terms than was
the case six or more years ago.
A student now takes 12 to 14
credits in each of these terms.
Before, the student carried more
than that number, usually 15 or
greater.

Secondly, there is the spring
term, It’s as simple as that. Last
spring, 30.2 percent of all grades
given during that six-week term
were “A” grades. Statistics from
the university registrar's office
show that nearly half of the
undergraduate student body took
only one course last spring. This

the country. The study found an
average increase in grade-point
average of .404 from 1960 to 1973.

Why the rise in grades? Juola’s
study suggests several possibili-
ties. He first suggests that the
possibility that students these
days are brighter than in the
early 1960's is unsubstantiated.

Shaffer’s ‘“Equus’-
difficult & beautiful

By BARNEY SKELTON
Entertainment Editor

Above all else Peter Shaffer's
Equus is a play which asks ques-
tions. However, the queries posed
are not of the type which can
be shrugged off easily or laid
aside with melifluous rhetoric.
Rather, they hit one in the gut
and demand answers despite the
fact that reason and empirical
thought are incapable of cop-
ing with them.

This is the dilemma in which
psychiatrist Martin Dysart, play-
ed by Lecky Stone, finds him-
self. He is confronted with a
teenage boy Alan Strang, Will
Cantler, who has gouged out the
eyes of several prize horses. In
the course of his sessions with
Alan, Dysart gradually begins to
realize the impotence of his
science in dealing with the boy
and finds himself becoming as
much the patient as the patient
himself. Thus the core of the
play revolves around this doc-
tor/patient, patient/patient re-
lationship. The rest of the char-
acters figure only in as much as
they amplify this relationship.

Thus, the extreme difficulty of
the role of Dysart lies in his
virtually perpetual stage presense
and the change he undergoes
from the cool, objective psychi-
atrist to the profoundly shaken
and introspective person he is by
the end of the play. Furthermore,
aside from the mime, there is
very little physical action in the
play; Dysart’s change in char-
acter must be portrayed almost
entirely through word inflection
and thought process.

Through a good part of the
first act it seemed as though Mr.
Stone was having a bit of a dif-
ficulty with this most delicate
of acting problems. The feeling
of Dysart’s dilemma simply was
not there. It was not until Prank
and Dora Strang, the parents of
the afflicted boy, played by
David DeChristopher and Mary
Ann Nabor, came on the stage
that the pace really picked up
and got moving. DeChristopher
did an excellent job as the hard-
nosed, atheistic father and serv-
ed as the perfect foil to Miss
Nabor's rendition of the “bleed-
ing-heart” religious fanatic that
she portrayed so well. Shortly
after the entrance of the parents,
the character of Dysart and his
relationship with Alan begins to
gel.

Will Cantler, as Alan-—a role
somewhat similar to that he
protrayed in Royal Hunt last
year, is to be commended for
capturing the petulence driven
by the inner torment which
causes the character to turn the
tables on Dysart and ask the
doctor, “What's your dream?”
This is certainly the prime role

of Alan: while Dysart is exorcis-
ing the horse-god Equus out of
Alan's mind, the boy is in turn
dashing apart the shell which
the doctor has built around his
own inner feeling by continually
probing his dream, his dark
secret. One's only objection to
Mr. Cantler’s performance might
be that he does not build up the
piteh of his final encounter with
Equus to a new and terrifying
height of agonized torment. In
this last scene Alan finds himself
unable to make love to a young
girl owing to the onlooking eyes
of the jealous horse-god. Regret-
tably, the feverishness of his
earlier stage encounter with
Equus seemed equally pronounc-
ed, whereas the climax at the
end should have been more
powerful.

It is really in the second act
that the power of the play takes
hold. Dysart realizes his ultimate
ineffectiveness, Mr. and Mfrs.
Strang give up in bewilderment
and young Strang seeks more
and more to purge himself of the
god he has created. All the actors
did an excellent job in rendering
the energy and force that the
play possesses and in general the
second act entirely makes up for
anything the first act lacked.

Not to be dismissed however, is
the prime importance that the
technical aspects of the play pos-
sessed. The lighting, cinematic,
and sound effects produced were
vital in their task of perpetuat-
ing the mystery and verisimili-
tude of the play, especially given
the limitations imposed by the
stage of the Troubadour Theater.
Particularly worth noting was
the film projection of Dysart’s
dream of the Delphic priests.

The inexorable presence of the
horses is, of course, the most
powerful leitmotif of the play
and the effectiveness of their
mime portrayals are vital. They
must seem mysterious gods, not
laughable animals. John Har-
grove as Nugget, and certainly
the rest of those involved in the
mime should be congratulated
for maintaining this air of the
bizarre and macabre which the
horses exude,

In the final analysis, as the
reviewer of Equus, one feels al-
most the same emotions as Mar-
tin Dysart. One cannot simply
talk of the play as being some-
thing “out there” which one is
observing, just as Dysart could
not ask Alan Strang of his
horse-god without asking many
questions of himself. It is a play
which demands personal involve-
ment of both cast and audience,
and Lee Kahn and the Univer-
sity Theatre players are to be
congratulated for their rendi-
tion of such a difficult, but beau-
tiful work of art.

the faculties around the country
more conscious of student views,
and the demonstrations may have
prompted curricular changes to
more “relevant” studies.

Juola also says the trend of
grade inflation may now be level-
ing off nationally. He says the
rate of inflation appears to be
slowing.

This may be true at Washing-
ton and Lee, too. For example,
the average senior grade point
ratio increased nearly .05 from
1970-71 to 1971-72, and again
from 1972-73. But the GPR in-
creased only .026 from 1972-73
to 1973-74.

Why have grades inflated ai
Washington and Lee? Some of
the reasons given by Juola in
his national study no doubt ap-
ply to Washington and Lee, but
there are possibly other reasons.
The primary one may be the
change in the semester system
from two 15-week semesters to
a 12-12-6 week system.

There may be two reasons for
grade inflation linked to this
switch in the semester system,
which was made in 1970-71.
Firstly, there is the fact that

SS gS UME is ie EMER ca aR ate a got

certainly seems a contributing
factor toward a higher percent-
age of “A” grades.

In comparing grade inflation
by class (freshmen, sophomore,
junior, senior), it is evident that
the Washington and Lee junior
has benefited the most from—or
contributed the most to—grade
inflation. The junior GPR rose
.279 from 1966-67 to 1973-74.
And, seniors have recorded the
lowest rate of grade inflation
among the four undergraduate
classes—.202 in that same period
of time. Sophomores recorded a
.211 rise and freshmen a .232 rise
over that same period of time.

Though grade inflation is in
evidence at Washington and Lee,
it is not as pronounced as the
national trend of rising marks.
And, as of yet, there has been
little serious open discussion here
about a faculty crackdown on
this inflation. And, as of yet,
there appears to be little rea-
son to bring about such a crack-
down.

(Next week—a study of grad-
ing in the university by depart-
ment.)

Ask Traveller

DEAR TRAVELLER—I thought I saw the last of dress codes when

I was in elementary school.

How come the commerce school

jocks all wear khaki pants, topsiders, white shirt, and 1947 ties?

(Signed) E. Atwood

DEAR E.—Yes, an unwritten dress code does exist at Washington and
Lee, although it would be wrong to strictly call it a dress code.
It's more of a code of conduct, dating back to post-Civil War
times when General Lee required all his horses to shave and

shower regularly.

Anyway, the code is employed today primarily as a means of
distinguishing different fields of studies. You have picked out
the most obvious code—that of the C-school jock. It is the most
obvious because C-School people are perhaps the most unimagina-
tive bodies in the university. Their idea of a good time is trying
to figure out who Newcomb Hall is named after. (Last we heard.
the C-school had that problem narrowed down to two choices—

Dean Varner or Sidney Lewis.)

Yes, the C-school clan makes itself known in an obvious
fashion, as you have described above. But don't forget the other
facets of this university, They, too, have their codes of conduct.

For example—

Those in art walk around with a box of crayons in their back

hip pocket.
Those in music hum.

Those in history hum the Battle Hymn of the Republic.
Those in sociology ask you how you're doing, and they're

actually serious about it.

Those in psychology ask you how you're doing, and then they

wonder why your lying to them.

Those in philosophy ask you how.

Those in physics tell you how.

Those in drama walk around pretending they're trees.
DEAR TRAVELLER-——What was your major here?

DEAR UNSIGNED—Hummm.

(Signed) Unsigned

FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH—It is not intended to be the
common practice of this column to have to explain what it
meant by such-and-such a remark, Certain circumstances per-
taining to last week's column, however, force this writer to make
such an explanation. That an explanation was needed was raised
by a midnight visit of 16 members of the Student Association of
Black Unity to my dorm room last week, asking me to explain
the last section of my article regarding Fancy Dress ‘see last

week's article for details).

The point is that no comments derogatory to SABU or to
blacks on this campus in general were intended, Indeed, this
writer meant by the wording of the article to ridicule both the
Student Activities Board ‘yes, that is what that organization is
really called) in its decision to require tuxedoes for those attend-
ing this winter's Fancy Dress and the university's past policy
towards blacks—namely, complete exclusion from the university
except for instnees of servility. Nothing else was intended. Period.

It is hoped that this will be the first and only such explana-
tion needed in this column. Indeed, an explanation of the racial
meaning of the column last week is merited only by the fact
that there still exists an atmosphere of racism at Washington and
and Lee, whether on one or both sides of the fence.

Perry turns the corner as a Sewanee player bites the dust.

WeL second in waterpolo

Richmond's “A” team rallied
for two goals late in regulation
time, then exploded for five goals
with Washington and Lee a man
short in overtime to win the Vir-

Basketball

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball team has started prepara-
tions for their 1974-75 season.

Head coach Verne Canfield
says that this year’s pre-season
workouts are more strenuous
than ever to make the team more
ready for the upcoming season,
but also admits that the players
are working harder.

The Generals will scrimmage
three times in November before
opening their season November
29 in Doremus Gymnasium
against Maryville College.

ginia State Water Polo Champ-
ionships 10-5, in Doremus Pool
on Saturday.

It was the second straight year
that the Spiders had captured
the state crown, and the second
year the Generals had finished
in the runnerup spot.

W&L, who lost to Richmond
in the winers’ bracket finals on
Friday, 7-5, ran out of men
with :30 seconds left when Dick
Barber fouled out. The Generals

were forced to play the rest of
the game six men aganist seven.

For the fourth year in a row
Barber, the Generals’ center
forward, was named the most
valuable player of the turna-
ment. Also named to the All-
State team were goalie Bill Tiers
and defenseman Jim Howard,
who earned the honor for the
second year in a row.

Four Richmond “A” players
rounded out the all-State team.

Harriers win seventh

Washington and Lee’s cross-
country team ran to their seventh
win of the season Saturday down-
ing West Virginia Tech, 24-33.

W&L co-captains Tem Wash-
ington and Jim McMenamin
paced the 12 runners over the
five-mile course with times of

28:19 and 39:05 respectively.
Tech’s James Sloan finished
third with a 29:23 time. W&L’s
Jesse O'Neal and Tech’s Robert
Layne rounded out the top five.

The Generals, now 7-4, host
Madison and Eastern Mennonite
on Saturday.

It was a long, long time in
coming, but everything finally
fell in place for Washington and
Lee’s football team Saturday.

And, as more than one player

was heard to say after the game,
“It couldn’t have come against
a more deserving opponent.”

Paced by the running of Mercer
West, the errorless play of the
offense, and a fine all-around
defensive effort, the Generals
ended their 13-game_ winless
spell with a 24-7 trouncing of
arch-rival Sewanee before a
gathering of 1500 loyalist at
Wilson Field.

The win earned W&L the re-
venge they had been seeking
against the Purple Tigers, who
last year, though leading 25-0,
went into a two-minute drill late
in the game, scoring a touchdown
on the game's final play for a
31-0 win.

“I was glad to see our players
come back from the nightmare
at Towson State (a 63-16 W&L
loss) to play 60 minutes of solid
football,” said W&L head coach
Bill McHenry after the game.

The Generals piled up 23 first
downs and 328 total offensive
yards against a Sewanee de-
fense which had allowed only
eight touchdowns in six previous
games. Almost two-thirds of the
total—209 yards—came on the
ground, as W&L ran the ball
63 times, twice as many rushes
as had been used in any game
this year.

West, a senior from Memphis,
Tenn., was the workhorse, carry-
ing 25 times for 126 yards. Nine
of the fullback’s blasts resulted
in first downs. West's effort
earned him offensive player of
the week honors.

Ironically, none of the four
W&L touchdowns came from the
fullback spot. Instead, the half-
backs did the scoring, as Rob
Lindsey, back in action after a
toe injury kept him sidelined in
the Towson State game, slammed
in three times from the one,
while freshman Raynard Scott,
who picked up 56 yards in 12
carries, added the fourth six-
pointer from two yards out.

The Generals had trouble add-
ing points after, however, as all
four PAT attempts, all for two
points, failed to reach the end
zone. McHenry noted that this,
as well as the kicking game,
were the only items on the down
side of the win.

Yet it was a punting situation
which proved to be the turning
point in the game. Just four
plays into the second half, W&L
chose to punt rather than try for
a first down on fourth and one
from their own 31. Freshman
George Makris, whose seven-
yard punt led to the Tigers’
lone touchdown in the first
quarter, took a low snap from
center and, on his own, decided
to run for the first down. He
made it by inches, keeping alive
a drive which later resulted in
Lindsey’s second tuochdown, giv-
ing the Generals the lead for
good at 12-7.

Sewanee got on the scoreboard
first after a Makris punt took
a reverse bounce before being
downed at the WL 33. Seven
plays later quarterbock Steve
Tipps found Chuck DeJaola with
an ll-yard scoring pass. Barry
Ray’s kick made it 7-0.

Early in the second period
W&L stopped a Tiger scoring
threat when linebacker Jeff
Slatcoff, the defensive player of
the game, intercepted a Ron
Swymer pass at the Generals’
eight, returning it 17 yards to
the W&L 25.

W&L then staged a 16-play,
75-yard scoring march, with
Lindsey scoring his first TD with
5:24 left in the half. Three times
during the march the Generals
were able to concert third down
situations to keep the drive alive.
Quarterback Jack Berry was
stopped short on a two-point at-
tempt, leaving W&L behind 7-6
at intermission.

W&L took the lead for good
with 8:07 remaining in the third
quarter as Lindsey capped a 78-
yard march in 15 plays with his
second one-yard scoring plunge.
West keyed the drive with six

carries for 35 yards, while Makris’

carry on the fourth down punt-
ing situation kept the drive a-
live. Again the Generals failed
on a two-point attempt, leaving
them with a 12-7 lead.

Sewanee came back and put to-
gether what was their last good
drive of the game, moving from
their own 38 to the W&L 22
before quarterback Tipps was
stopped short of a first down by
Slatcoff and Jeff Opp.

The Generals iced the game
with two touchdowns in the final
quarter. Both scores were set up
by Tiger turnovers.

Two plays into the period
Louis McFadden fell on a Brian
Landry fumble at the Sewanee
44. Berry connected on three
straight passes to move the ball
to the two, then handed off to
Scott, who slammed in over the
right side to make it 18-7. Again,
however, the Generals missed a
two-point attempt when line-
backer Dudley West picked off
a Berry pass.

Wé&L got the ball back one
play after the kick-off, when
Swymer, back in at quarterback
for the Tigers, underthrew wide
receiver Henry Rast, and Opp
intercepted at the Generals 44.

Berry then moved W&L for
their final touchdown, mixing
the run and the pass well in an
ll-play, 56-yard drive that end-
ed when Lindsey scored on
fourth-and-goal from the one for
his third touchdown of the game.
The fourth miss on a two-point
attempt gave the Generals a 34-
7 lead, which the defense made
stand up until the final seconds
ticked off the scoreboard.

It was an extra-special win
for the W&L defense, as well as
defensive coach Boyd Williams,
whose dislike for the Tigers was
a source of incentive for the Gen-
erals all week,

“We wanted to win it for
Coach Williams because we know
he'd rather beat ‘those people’
than anyone else,” said one de-
fensive player after the game.

But more important, the Gen-
erals finally beat someone, some-
thing they hadn't done in a long
time.
