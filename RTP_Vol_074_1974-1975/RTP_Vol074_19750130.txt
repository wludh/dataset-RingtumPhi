Satirical ‘Lion in Winter’ promised

Phi Staff Reporter

The Universiy Theatre’s pro-
duction of “Lion in Winter,” a
two-act play written by James
Goldman, opens next Monday
night, Feb. 3, at 8 p.m., and will
continue through Saturday, Feb.
8.

The play is directed by David
DeChristopher, a drama major at
W&L, as his senior thesis. De-
Christopher chose the text by
Goldman, who has written such
screenplays as “Nickolas and
Alexandra” and “They Might be
Giants,” because of his interest
in the basic principles of acting
and style which are reflected in
the play. He also found the depth
of character, as expressed in the
dialogue, challenging from a di-
rector’s point of view.

Be forewarned if you are ex-
pecting this production to resem-
ble the movie, which featured
Richard Burton and Katherine

Hepburn, The play is not set in
such a rich historical context —
the sets, designed by Walter Ro-
manchuk, are stark and sugges-
tive, but not grounded in reality.

The action revolves around a
meeting of the seven characters
during the Christmas of 1183, as
they attempt to decide how the
kingdom of the aging Henry II
of England (David Minton)
should be divided. The queen,
Eleanor of Aquitane (Marcia Wil-
son), favors her eldest son, Rich-
ard the Lionhearted( Dan Scott),
while Henry is inclined to let the
youngest son, John (Scott Win-
zeler), ascend the throne.

The middle son, Geoffrey (Jim
Overton), would “sell them all”
in his ambitions to become king,
and to placate him both of his
brothers promise him the posi-
tion of Chancellor in exchange
for his support of them. In addi-
tion, King Philip of France (Don

SAB, film committee
request EC funding

By JOE FITZGERALD

John Killpack of the Student
Activities Board and Ken Mash-
burn of the Film Committee ap-
peared before the Executive Com-
mittee Monday night to ask for
funds to cover unpaid bills in-
curred by last year’s Film Com-
mittee. The 1973-74 committee
left bills totalling $518 and Mash-
burn reported that paying the
money out of this year’s budget
would cause serious problems in
the Winter and Spring schedules.

The E.C. told Mashburn and
Killpack to “come back after
Fancy Dress,” in the words of
vice-president Bob Keatley. The
E.C. wants to wait and see if the
SAB can cover the committee's
expenses from the money taken
in from that weekend. The E.C.
would have to use money from
their Reserve Fund to cover the
bills and they are reluctant to
use that money unless someone
needs funds and cannot obtain it
from any other source.

Later in the meeting the E.C.
voted to give Bill Sturges of the
University Federation $150 from
their Reserve Fund to help spon-
sor the dance being held this
Saturday, Feb. 1, in Evans Dining
Hall.

The money was given with the
understanding that Sturges would
return $50 of it if he could get
enough from other contributors
to make up the difference.

The dance is being co-sponsor-
ed by the Federation. Pi Kappa
Phi fraternity, SAB and, as of
Monday night, the E.C. A bus is
coming from Hollins and girls are
expected from other colleges

Admission will be $1 for ladies
The price in-

and $2 for men

cludes all the beer one can drink.
All proceeds from the mixer will
go to the Federation's Winter
Clothing Drive.

In other business, the E.C.
heard a report from Jay DuRiv-
age of the Cold Check Commit-
tee. DuRivage reported that the
committee now has $327 in out-
standing debts; $200 of that
amount is owed by persons who
have graduated or left the uni-
versity and $118 of it is expected
this week.

DuRivage expressed his con-
cern over the large number of
checks bounced just before the
Christmas break. Bad checks had
averaged $20-30 a month until
then, but the committee has re-
ceived $312 since Christmas. He
said the committee expects the
same thing to happen after the
Spring break and at the end of
the year and that such an oc-
eurence could hurt the commit-
tee’s finances. The committee
may have to double fines to dis-
courage persons from passing
bad checks just before they leave
town.

Hogle) and his sister Alais
(Tama Natkin) are at court, and
their presence further compli-
cates negotiations.

The play is a collage of scenes
during which each character
maneuvers to consolidate his or
her position; no holds are barred
as each finds his or her proposed
course blocked by someone else.
Everyone except Alais, who is
also Henry's mistress, realizes
the mundane condition of his or
her experience and tries to rise
above it through burlesque and
sarcastic humor, but in the end
each fails.

“The language is exciting and
slick, and full of metaphor and
word play,” says DeChristopher.
“The play is very light, unlike
the movie, and in most cases
takes the conventional point of
view toward love, marriage, lon-
liness and _ lovelessness.” The
small size of the cast adds to the
intimacy of the production — the
spectacle that was apparent in
the cinema adaptation is replac-
ed by intense dialogue in what is
more of a character study than
an historically accurate play.

Curtain time each evening is
8 p.m., and reservations in ad-
vance are necessary. Reserva-
tions can be made by telephon-
ing the Theatre at 463-9111, ext.
273.

 

Dan Scott as Richard Coeur de Lion and Marcia Wilson as Eleanor of Aquitane rehearse for the Wash-
ington and Lee University Theatre's production of “Lion in Winter,” which opens Monday (Feb. 3)
jor a six-day run. The W&L Theatre's production of the 1966 James Goldman Broadway success is di-
rected by David DeChristopher, a drama major at Washington and Lee, as his senior thesis.

Student apartments to be ready
for occupancy next September

By HALE DELAVAN
Phi News Staff

By May 1, 1975, the campus
should see the completion of the
Woods Creek Apartments. Ori-
ginally scheduled for occupancy
by September, 1974, several prob-
lems arose that delayed construc-
tion.

A long period of bad weather
slowed the rate of construction
from the outset. Trouble obtain-
ing building materials and labor
crews also kept the contractor
from proceeding on schedule.

These problems have now been
solved and work is progressing
rapidly. According to the Univer-
sity, the furniture is already here
and ready to be put in place.
The apartments are designed to
house three to five students who
will share a common living room,
kitchen and dining room. The
entire building will be air-con-
ditioned, completely furnished
and carpeted. The units will be
assigned to students on a first-
come, first-served basis.
University officials hope that
the entire project will be financ-

Plans for Fancy Dress changed

By Phi News Staff

According to Student Activi-
ties Board chairman John Kill-
pack, Fancy Dress 1975 will in-
corporate several changes in the
events of the weekend which
will run from Thursday, Febru-
ary 20 to Sunday, February 23.

Killpack announced at Mon-
day's EC meeting that due to
misunderstandings over the book-

 

Ellen Stewart, producer of me 500 plays and executive director
/ La Mama Experimental Theatre Club of New York City, will
present a lecture and demonstration ‘Ol! to Broadway: Na-
tional and International Identity on Wednesday, February 5
at 4:15 { Troubadour Theatre. Her visit to campus is spon-
red by ft WEL ¢ department and the University Center

‘ j jn

ing, Bill Deal and the Rhondells
will not be performing on Thurs-
day night at Zollman’s Pavilion.
Instead, an effort is currently
being made to sign the Tams to
perform in place of the Rhon-
dells.

In addition, Champale will
be served at Friday night's Fancy
Dress Ball and will be included in
the total cost of the weekend. In
order to get an understanding of
what the Student Center is going
to look like when decorated, the
SAB is also currently attempting
to set up a room in the Student
Center that will resemble the
way the Center will be decorated
for the ball

Furthermore, the dress for
Friday night's ball is black tie
and students are encouraged to

dress as such. However, suits will
be allowed although sports coats
will not be. The SAB, in conjunc-
tion with the College Town Shop,
has announced that they will be
offering drastically reduced
prices on all tuxedo rentals for
Fancy Dress. The total price of a
tuxedo and accessories for the
ball will be $11. In order to pro-
mote the use of formal wear, the
College Town Shop is cutting its
rental costs on tuxedos for this
event only

At this time, the SAB is still
looking for interested students to
help them out in organizing the
weekend. All those interested can
contact John Killpack or any
SAB member or leave a message
in the SAB office in the Student
Center.

Phi New staff

Do you like beer, bands, and
broads? And do you also like to
help out the needy people in the
area by having a great time?

Washington and Lee students
will be able to satisfy both of
ires by attending a mix-
er sponsored by the University
and Pi Kappa Phi
this Saturday night in Evans Din-

ina Hall. There will be an ample
amount of free beer inside the
door. The music will be provided

by “Staircase.” a musically flex-
ible band from Charlotte. The
group plays soul, rock and roll,

and Top Forty songs
In addition there will be girls

there to keep everyone happy
Contingents will arrive by the
curload from the major girl

schools in the area. The sponsors
have made great efforts to ad-
vertise the mixer at these schools
and expect a large turnout of the
opposite sex

The price of admission will be
two dollars for men and one dol-
lar for each girl. The festivities
will begin at eight o'clock and
will last until midnight

The purpose for the mixer is
much more serious than the
mixer itself. Thanks to contribu-
tions by the E.C. and the SAB
all of the proceeds from the
dance will go towards the winte
clothing drive. The sponsors will
turn the money over to Rock
bridge area social services for
distribution to the many needy

ed by the Virginia College Build-
ing Authority, a state agency es-
tablished two years ago. Its pur-
pose is to issue tax-free revenue
bonds for the financing of educa-
tional facilities at private institu-
tions. The advantage of the
VCBA program is that it gives
private institutions the same fi-
nancial opportunities open to
public institutions.

Steady progress has been made

toward finishing the complex
since October. With new crews
on the job, the apartments

should be ready for occupancy
by the beginning of the 1975-76
school year. Special rental pro-
cedures are in effect this year
owing to the tentative nature of
the completion date. Next year,
new procedures with regular
sign-up periods, binding rental
contracts and non-returnable re-
servation fees will be in effect.
There will be no charge in the
rental fees set up for next year:
$650 to $750 per student for the
academic year.

Most of the students in this
complex will have private bed-
rooms. However, of the 178 stu-
dents signed for occupancy, 32

will share their bedrooms. Re-
quests for places in the apart-
ments should be filed with Mr.
W.N. Mohler, Associate Director
of University Services, in Wash-

Staff editorials

It will be our policy to allot space in our editorial columns,
from time to time, to staff members who have strong and
legitimate feelings on a topic with which they have become
familiar as a result of their work for the Ring-tum Phi,

It is the feeling of the editor that when a staff member has

developed a responsible editorial on a topic of concern, he
ought to be given the privilege of whatever “weight” the edi-
torial columns of this paper carry.

In all circumstances, the editor realizing he has final
responsibility for the content of the newspaper — will pass
prior judgment on the suitability of each draft “staff editorial ;”
and because they will almost always express points of view
differing somewhat from his own, these occasional editorials
will be distinguished by the appearance of their writer’s initials
at their conclusions.

SAB

Rambling through some old minutes of Executive Com-
mittee meetings, | came across a list of expenditures and re-
ceipts of the Student Activities Board as of January 20.

The film committee has spent $1,528 while collecting $2,527 ;
the University Center committee spent $1,367 while collecting
$2,664; and the entertainment (or lack thereof) committee
spent “only” (in the words of the EC minutes) $9,314 while
collecting $21,347. All receipts include moneys originally al-
located to SAB from the student body tax. The total leaves a
net reserve of more than $15,000 in SAB’s cash box, according
to the minutes of the EC.

Thus, some $12,000 of the student body’s money has been
spent. Where? Among the more memorable SAB functions of
last term were the many films (which actually did seem to be
reasonable and entertaining), a $5,000 dive known as the
Souther-Hillman-Furay Band and Dan Fogelberg (which
came on a Thursday night), a successful mixer-and-all-you-
can-drink-beer-affair (which seems like one of the few things
the SAB has done which is worth repeating, and which, of
course, won't be repeated), and a party co-sponsored with
Contact '75 for parents during Parents’ Weekend (which re-
ceived little, if any, publicity and which didn’t exactly focus
on the entertainment needs of the students).

Other than that, not much less, if there was anything else,
seems to stick in this columnist’s mind.

And all that cost this columnist, as an individual, about
nine dollars, not including the price of the films, the mixer, and
the concert.

| don’t think “all” that was worth three dollars, to me or
to anyone else on campus, save those on the SAB, maybe.

I've been waiting out this term before I start getting irate
at the SAB, waiting for, perhaps, another mixer-and-beer-
bash, or some really good flicks, or somethnig that appeals to
more than a small minority of the students on this campus.
Save for Fancy Dress, I see no such prospects in sight.

Thus, | await Fancy Dress. SAB has already condescended
to the rest of the students, allowing suits as well as tuxedos,
and SAB has even worked out a deal with the College Town
Shop where tuxedos can be rented for 11 bucks. Even though
it is being planned by SAB, Faney Dress looks promising.

The point is that this has been less than a stellar year for
SAB. Its accomplishments have been so few that even a per-
fect Fancy Dress will still leave a bad taste in my mouth about
leaving SAB in control of my student body taxes. Fancy Dress
mav be the best thing ever on this campus when it comes
around next month, but it certainly won't be worth the $35
| paid in student taxes (W hich will be what I am paying for
Fancy Dress, since the rest of the SAB functions this year
have been worthless). And, that $35 doesn’t even include the
$10 fee for the affair, along with dinner, tuxedo, ete.

And what would even bother me more is if a line | read in
the EC minutes is true—"“Killpack said that fraternities will be
able to buy tickets in blocks.” As an independent, | do not
particularly care to subsidize fraternities.

In conclusion, let me congratulate those on 5 \B—and on
the EC—who have made ODK and “Who's Who” this year;
these seem to be the only noteworthy accomplishments of

either this year,

Ask Traveller

DEAR TRAVELLER—I'm a freshman and my stock in Boone’s Farm
has plummeted. Am I still eligible for financial aid here?
(Signed) Merrill Lynch

DEAR MERRILL-—My initial advice is for you to dump your stock
and buy up some stock in a grain-alcohol firm before Fancy Dress
gets here. Whatever, the answer to your question is an unmistake-
able yes.

There is much in the way of financial aid in various forms at
Washington and Lee. Aid varies from the work-study program (which
itself ranges from explaining Doonesbury comics in Washington Hall
to polishing topsiders in the C-school to ordering finger paints for
the fine arts department) to the full scholarship, available to any
registered Whig from Botetourt County with a lisp who knows all
seven verses of ‘‘Dixie.”

The most popular of scholarships given at Washington and Lee
is the partial scholarship, so called because the university can’t af-
ford to pay all the tuition it charges, The partial scholarship is usu-
ally used to pay a portion of the student’s costs, such as part of tui-
tion, laundry, food, or gas to power his MG down to Hollins and back.
Actually, the partial scholarship is a nice way for the university to
say that it is aiding, say, 250 students at the university. This looks
good when the school appeals to the alumni for funds, as long as the
alumni don’t find out that the university has granted, say, 250 one
dollar partial scholarships.

But there are a number of scholarships listed in the back of the
catalogue which students perennially fail to take advantage of. Some
of these scholarships include:

       

—The H. John Ackerman Memorial Scholarship, This prestigious
award goes to any freshman who picks up a Southern Seminary date
at the BV porno flick and takes her back to his room, Stipend: a gift
certificate from Fiesta Prophylactics.

~The Douglas Schwartz Memorial Scroll, given in memory of co-
education, executive fiat, terminal diarrhea, and other issues last
raised on this campus by a hippie radical law student who wore suit
coats over blue denim shorts. Given to that freshman who most be-
lieves that he can really change the thinking of this campus.
Stipend: $15, and a year’s subscription to the Alumni Magazine.

—The Irving Fitzgerald Snodhappy Award, This coveted piece of
garbage goes to that upperclassman who best exemplifies apathy on
campus. Nominees must not participate in any activities on campus,
save perhaps the EC. Award: $25, and membership in “Who's He in
American Colleges and Delicatessens.

—The “I’ve Got a Secret” Award, given to the student who com-
mits the most Honor violations without getting caught. Friends of
the EC are excluded.

—The Commons Award for Excellence in Jello-chucking. This
award is a stipend of $50 and a broom, given to the student who dis-
plays the most talent, artistry, and accuracy in food-throwing in the
dining hall. Nominees are judged by the art department, with the
winning entry to be modeled in Art 103.

Prof. Jennings’ proteges make a movie:
the bloody ‘Texas Chain Saw Massacre’

Could a meek, mild-mannered
journalism professor inspire such
insanity as “The Texas Chain
Saw Massacre?”

The film, which recently ap-
peared at the Lyric Theatre, was
produced, written, directed and
performed by a group of Univer-
sity of Texas students. Some of
those students took part in a
seminar at the University of
Texas under Prof. John K. Jenn-
ings, now teaching in Washing-
ton and Lee’s Department of
Journalism.

“Aw, you really don’t want to
write anything about this, do
you? It’s just a couple of old
Texas boys having a little fun,”
says Mr. Jennings.

He says he knows of only two
students of his who participated
in the film. Danny Pear! direct-
ed the cinematography, and Ted
Michilou wrote the script, which
apparently contains more

screams and groans than any-
thing else.

Mr. Jennings says the film was
conceived and produced long af-
ter he left the University of
Texas to return to Washington
and Lee. He disclaims any sug-
gestion that his grading system
inspired the movie.

“The Texas Chain Saw Mass-
acre” is said to be based on a
true story. But nobody seems to
be able to think of what that
story may be. The film ad runs
something to the tune of “Who
will be left, and what will be left
of them?” Nice.

Mr. Jennings says he has not
yet seen the movie. He says he
won't ever see the movie, even if
it was produced by some former
students of his. He did not ela-
borate, but then, he didn't really
have to.

The film seems to be a radical
extension of the recent escapism

Washington and Lee will par-
ticipate again this year with six
other colleges (Hampden-Sydney,

is designed primarily for juniors.
To be eligible to take part in this

student must have a 2.00 cumula-

Croghan has good week

WéeL stops Eagles;
shot down by Roanoke

ty BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

What would you do if you were
the coach of a basketball team
which was being victimized by
your opponent’s hottest shooting
night in five years? Would you:

1) Try to toughen up your de-
fense in hopes that it would, to
some extent, cool down the op-
position?

2) Join your foe in the run-
and-gun game and try to make
up the lost ground?

3) Stand around and wait for
your opponent to start missing
with more regularity?

Washington and Lee tried a
little of each Saturday against
Roanoke College, but found that
none of them worked as the Ma-
roons shot a blazing 64 percent
from the field in romping to a
102-83 win over the Generals in
the Salem-Roanoke Valley Civic
Center.

Earlier in the week, W&L had
rallied from a nine-point half-
time deficit to beat Bridgewater
College, 64-53 in a VCAA confer-
ence game, thus giving the Gen-
erals the lead in the Western Di-
vision.

W&L, now 3-0 in its division,
leads defending division champ
Madison by one full game. The
Generals and Dukes could be
playing for the division title in
the regular season finale on Feb-
ruary 22.

As for what occured last week:

Co-captain Greg Croghan’s
best game at W&L sparked the
Generals in their second-half
comeback to down the Eagles on
the losers’ home floor Wednes-
day.

The 6’3” senior from Annan-
dale, Va., threw in a season-high
19 points while adding 17 re-
bounds, many of them off the of-
fensive boards.

Croghan’s play in the first half
kept W&L in a ballgame which
Bridgewater threatened to break
wide open with some deadeye
outside shooting in the early go-
ing.

The Eagles’ backcourt of Ron
Simms and Ken Utterback hit on
their first six shots, and, before
anyone had worked up a sweat,
Bridgewater was on top, 12-2.

However, Bridgewater’s front
line got in foul trouble, and, with
66” center Tom Wright and for-
wards Bill Gardner and Dennis
Gibson on the bench for part of
the first half with three fouls
each, the Generals gradually
pulled within nine points at in-
termission, 35-26.

Then the game changed com-
plexions. After allowing more
than their defensive average usu-
ally called for, the Generals re-
turned to their aggressive style
of defense and stopped the
Eagles cold.

It took Bridgewater 5:10 to
score their first field goal of the
second half, and by that time,
W&L had pulled within 38-37.

Matmen have
long Saturday

By LEE KECK
Phi Sports Staff

After devastating Eastern Men-
nonite last Tuesday, Washington
and Lee's wrestlers suffered a let-
down, dropping two of three
matches in Saturday's quadrang-
ular dual meet in Doremus Gym.

Against Mennonite all but two
wrestlers won their individual
matches. Brian Tray (142) and
David Mintz (150) each manag-
ed superior decisions, 15-2 and
14-4. Steve White (190), in his
first match of the season, and
Steve Schweizerhof (Hwt) both
picked up pins 30 seconds into
the second period.

 

thee

 

The Generals started Satur-
day in good fashion by defeating
V.P.1., 28-9. They then lost to
Pembroke State College, 38-2,
and Western Carolina, 20-14. Ho-
ward Knipp (118), Don Over-
dorff (126), and Schweizerhof
gained two victories apiece to
lead the team.

The Generals team record now
stands at 7-3. Leading in indivi-
dual records are Knipp (9-1),
Jim Crytzer at 150 (8-1-1), Doug
Ford 167 (6-2), and Overdorff
(7-3). W&L’'s last home meet was
yesterday against V.M.I. The
team now travels to a tourna-
ment at Virginia State on Satur-
day and to the VCAA meet on
February 8.

The Generals kept up the pres-
sure, and, with Croghan and
Norm Kristoff doing the offen-
sive work, moved to a 10-point
lead at 55-45.

The Eagles then resorted to
fouls in an attempt to get the
ball back, but freshman Bob
Forlenza responded for W&L by
hitting three one-and-one situa-
tions to ice the game for the
Generals,

Kristoff finished not far be-
hind Croghan with 14 points and
10 rebounds, while Forlenza had
eight points.

Roanoke’s All-American Ross
Robinson went wild against W&L
on Saturday, and his Maroon
teammates chipped in with some
out-of-this-worldness of their
own.

Robinson, forced to play sec-
ond fiddle to Jay Piccola for the
past two years, fired home a

career-high 37 points to lead
Roanoke to an easy romp over
the head-shaking Generals, who
couldn't believe what they saw.

“Awesome,” was the reply of
more than one W&L player when
asked what they thought about
Roanoke, and especially their
shooting ability.

Roanoke hit on 73 percent of
their field goal attempts in the
first half, and finished the game
with a 64 percent accuracy.

The Generals were never in
the game after Roanoke ran off
15 points in four minutes to take
a 21-13 lead. After that, it was
all Maroons.

Robinson missed only one shot
in the first half en route to 20
points by intermission, while his
running mates on the front line
Walt Reaves and Howard Ray
added 10 and eight each in the
opening half.

February vacation set

By RYLAND OWEN

The Washington holiday, de-
signed as a mid-term break, will
begin on Wednesday, Feb. 12, at
5:05 p.m., and classes will resume
Monday, Feb. 17.

Although there have been com-
plaints as to the wisdom behind
the planning of such a short holi-
day nothing can be done about
this year’s academic calendar.
According to David McLean,

Freshman Representative to the
University Council, the academic
calendar for 1974-75 has already
been approved by the UC and
nothing can be done about it this
year.

Next year’s calendar, however,
has been revised. In addition to
extending the Christmas break
to Monday, Jan. 5, the UC has
approved a ten-day Washington
holiday, from Friday, Feb. 13 to
Monday, Feb. 23.

Professor Gaughan’s son loses sled

(Continued from page 2)

he brought his sled along. He
found a good hill for sledding
along side duPont Hall.

In the early afternoon, he
stopped sledding for awhile to
build a snow man, When he went
back to use the sled, he found
that it had disapeared.

Eight year old boys are too
old to cry, and my son didn’t cry.

Even so, it was rather hard to
make him understand that some-
one would take his sled away.
Perhaps someone made a mis-

take. The sled is an “American
Flyer.” No official report of its
loss has been made. If the person
who has taken it will kindly re-
turn it to the front of the law
school, no questions will be asked.

Sincerely yours,

Lawrence D. Gaughan
