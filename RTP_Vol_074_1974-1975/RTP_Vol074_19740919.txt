THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Ross L. Malone, recently ap-
pointed rector of the univer-
sity, died Aug, 18 in Roswell,

Mex,, at the age of 63.

Malone, who had served on
the board of trustees of Wash-
ington and Lee since 1967, was
named rector, or chairman,
during the last academic year.

A former president of the

American Bar Association, the
1932 graduate was vice presi-

dent of General Motors Corp.
at the time of his death. He
was GM's” general counsel
(head of its legal staff) until
early August, when he gave
up that position for reasons of
health,

Mr. Malone is survived by
his wife, Ami Malone; by a sis-

', Mrs. Edna Malone Schwarz

of Ruidoso, N. Mex., and by
three brothers, Baynard W.

Mr. Malone's death came just

four days before he was to
have received the American
Bar Association’s Medal, the

ABA’s highest honor, at its an-
nual meeting in Honolulu, The
citation prepared for Mr. Ma-
lone spoke of his “unequaled
integrity and quiet determina-
tion” and said he “helped im-
measurably to define and up-

grade our professional respon-
sibility.”

The citation credited Malone
with leading the drive for con-
tinuing education for lawyers
and it noted his role in draft-
ing the 25th Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution.

He was president of the
American Bar Association in
1958-59 and was deputy U. 5.
Attorney General in 1952-53.
Before joining General Motors
in 1967, he was in private law
practice in Roswell.

Malone was _ professionally
active in bar groups in three
countries and was at various
times president or a director
of the American Bar Founda-
tion, the American College of
Trial Lawyers and the Ameri-
can Judicature Society. He was
a task force chairman on the
Hoover Commission and a
member of the Presidential
Commission on Law Enforce-
ment and the American Revo-
lution Bicentennial Commis-
sion in the Johnson admini-
stration,

He was chairman of Wash-
ington and Lee’s law school
development committee since
its ineeption in 1972. That
group has raised more than
$11.7 million to date against
its 1976 objective of $14.5 mil-

isolate the freshmen more, to es-
tablish stringent contact rules, so
that all fraternities will have an
equal chance to rush freshmen.”

Ramey added that providing ex-
plicit times when freshmen can
and cannot be contacted by fra-
ternity members allows the new
students more time to attend to
their studies.

As a result of the IFC’s wish to
strengthen enforcement of exist-
ing rushing rules, fines are stif-
fened and extra IFC representa-
tives are policing Rush functions
at fraternity houses.

Three houses have been placed
on conduct probation and one
house has been fined for infrac-
tions of no-contact rules.

The registration fee for Rush
is $13.50 again his year. This sum
helps to cover the IFC's cost in
managing the rush program,
which began on September 11th
and will continue through Octo-
ber 4th.

‘Tradition

As we return to campus for another school year we find
that President Huntley has moved out of the traditional home
of Washington and Lee presidents to a private location, His
desire for privacy is understandable. Few people would prob-
ably insist that he should attempt to raise a family a few yards
from the freshman dorms—not the best of all moral influences
for young ladies.

And yet his move gives one pause, The change of location
is not earthshaking in itself, to be sure. It is to a small extent
a break with the past and brings to mind a point we would
like to make at the beginning of the year.

Washington and Lee is a school built on time-honored
traditions, The school has grown in the shadows of two of
America’s greatest leaders and has achieved an academic ex-
cellence which few can boast.

The university has never been one to follow the lead of
institutions or the fashionable trends in education, We
are not ike most other colleges in that we have more to look
back on with pride. We have more than a present and a fu-
ture—-we have a past.

It is important that we remember at all times just how
unique we are and not lose our identity in a foolish attempt to
keep pace with others who change for the sake of modernity
and experimentation, We must be extremely careful in ef-
fecting any change here because we have so much to lose and
can not be sure of what is to be gained.

The present academic year will probably see the reappear-
ance of many issues which could lead to radical changes in
the school as we know it, e.g. coeducation. We hope that in a
desire to change W&L those seeking reform will keep in mind
our achievements to date. [t is often unwise to tamper with a

other

 

good thing and Washington and Lee is undoubtably a good
thing.

Our Policy

We of the Ring-tum Phi aim to make the paper representa-
tive of all facets of life at Washington and Lee, To this end
we will attempt to present all shades of student opinion to
our readers. We invite your comments, criticism and opinions
on any topics of general interest to the university community.

Letters to the editor are welcomed at any time. We only
ask that they be constructive and refer to campus issues. All
letters received will be run unless they are in poor taste, ex-
cessively long or repeat the sentifents of other letters printed
on the same topic,

The editorial policy of this paper will be grounded in a
concern for the best interests of Washington and Lee and in
the maintenance of its traditional high standards.

Once again, your help in our endeavor to make the Ring-
tum Phi a student newspaper would be greatly appreciated.

It is too bad that the students
weren't here to share the folly.
The rallies would have been boi-
sterous and the parades with Mel
Greenberg banners would have
furnished such excitement as to
make Macy’s Thanksgiving pro-
cession seem inconsequential.
Fraternities would have held
“Free Mel Greenberg parties” and
perhaps even a new potable,—
say a Greenberger; drink it and
see stars—would have brewed in
one of the Greek houses.

Mr. Twain, the sure-talking ‘“mov-

Lexington this summer that reads
like one of the stories from
America’s beloved humorist.

He came to make a movie he
told everyone, and at times the
fifty-two year old man must have
believed it himself. He put an ad-
vertisement in the local paper
announcing that he would he in-

the dreams that pervaded the
minds of students, housewives,
teachers, husbands, and others
who interrupted their regular
schedules to go out and see Mr.
Greenberg at the Keydet-General
Motel.

This mysterious stranger stirr-
ed more excitement with pro-
mises of Hollywood stardom in
Lexington. Names like Burt Lan-
caster, Kirk Douglas, Audrey
Hepburn, and Phil Silvers were
daunting skeptics, and enthrall-
ing the believers. Local motel
rooms were reserved for coming
Hollywood crews. Two secretaries
were hired for Mr. Greenberg.
Approximately 500 to 800 people
were needed as extras, mostly in
battlefield scenes. And the word
got around about the "$12,000

buxom and talented women (36

Hopes of stardom frustrated

Lexington back on the map. The
story of the hoax hit the Associat-
ed Press lines and soon every
major newspaper in the country
had the opportunity to discover
Lexington, Va. Correspondents
from major national magazines
came to Lexington to investigate;
newscasters from area and na-
tional networks brought film
crews to show America what hap-
pened in Lexington, Virginia. In-
deed, Mel’s promises of publicity
came true,

Mel Greenberg was arrested in
Hillsboro, Ohio on the eighteenth
of June. By that time Greenberg
had become to some Lexington-
ians sort of a folk hero, Admira-

his deceptional skills, and his abil-

All humor is based on man’s

Theatre opens new season

by Barney Skelton

While the fall season at the
University Theatre holds in store
for the Washington and Lee audi-
ence a thematic format which is
similar to that of last years, the
productions should prove far from
repitious. Equus, by Peter Shaf-
fer, and Don Juan, by Moliere,
echo the preceding year’s Fall
plavbill in that: 1) playwright
Shaffer's Reyal Hunt of the
Sun was the first production, and
Was, as is Kquus, a philosophical
challenge to Christianity; and 2)
Sir George Etherege’s Man of
Mode, although written later in
the century, was a 17th century
comedy of manners as is Don
Juan, However, the similarities
diminish in stature when one ex-
amines the particularities of each
of the plays.

Equus, opposed to Royal Hunt,
is a play of words not action. Al-
though it contains mime in some
of its seenes, the basic plotline
revolves around what is a physi-
cally statie situation. A psychiat-
rist is attempting to help a dis-
turbed boy who is haunted by a
horse god he calls Equus, ‘Thus
most of the seript is dialogue. In
contrast, one of the most poig-
nant leitmotifs of Reyal Hunt was
the incessant marching of Pizarro
and his men, indefatigably track-
ing down the Inca god-man Ata-
hualpa. A further, and more obvi-
ous distinction between the two
plays is that Equus is a realistic
drama in a modern-day setting,
while Reyal Hunt was somewhat
of a pageant, set in the 16th cen-
tury.

Of course, the major difference
between Man of Mode and Don
Juan is that the former is an Eng-
lish play, while the latter is
French. Even though they were
written In roughly the same per
lod, this difference in nationality

In case you weren't, aren’t, or
haven't been made aware of it,
Washington and Lee had a foot-
ball game Saturday.

But maybe you'd be better off
not knowing too much about it.

The Generals, now in Phase II
of their rebuilding program,
were overwhelmed by Millersville
State (Pa.), 306, in their 1974
season opener. The loss extended

the two-season losing string to
eight, but head coach Bill Me-
llenry said nothing to indicate

that the end of the streak was far
off.

“Sure we're disappointed, but
we're not at all discouraged,” the
second year mentor lamented af-
ter the game. “We were beaten
by a fine football team which
dominated us in almost every as-
pect of the game.”

Yet domination might not be a
strong enough term to describe
the Maraders’ control of the

game, Millersville, behind quar-

Dennis Booker, who at 6’3 and

sized any W&L player, amassed

W&L netted only 152 yards, a fi-

big pressure all afternoon, hit on
18 of 47 passes for 178 yards. In-
cluded in the total was the lone
W&L touchdown, a_ three-yard
strike to junior receiver Mark
George in the third quarter.

McHenry termed the perform-
ance of his corps of receivers the
lone bright spot on offense.

“George (six catches for 71
yards), Tony Perry (six catches
for 58 yards), and Kamon Cassell
(three catches for 38 yards) did
an excellent job of catching the
football,” MeHenry said,

Cassell was one of six fresh-
men who were in Saturday’s
starting lineup. In all, 11 mem-
bers of the classes of 1977 and
1978 got the nod for the opening
whistle. But McHenry did not
blame any lack of experience for
the defeat.

“We simply did not execute,
and we did this against a, team
with superior manpower,” Mc-
Henry said, “It all adds up, and
the result has to be obvious.”

The Marauders got on the score-
board late in the first period. Af-
ter a Berry pass fell into enemy
hands, they drove 30 yards in five
plays, with Burke going the final
six yards for the score. Barry
Brunner’s kick made it 7-0.

The Generals were forced to
punt, and on the ensuing posses-
sion it took Millersville only three
aerial strikes to score. Burke
connected on passes of 23 and
seven yards, then found flanker

giving Millersville a 13-0 lead af-

That lead was stretched to 19-0
early in the second stanza as
Booker, who totalled 104 yards in
11 carries, ripped off gains of 35,
38, and three yards, the final
carry good for the score. Again
Brunner’s kick went wide, and
the homestanders took a 19-0 lead

Tough year ahead

by SANDY BISHOP

Depth and experience would
have to be the key factors for a
successful season for Washington
and Lee’s 1974 soccer team.

The Generals face a tough sche-
dule which includes Navy, Gettys-
burg, Lynchburg, and state pow-
er Madison. However, with fif-
teen lettermen returning, Coach
Joe Lyles holds high hopes for a
winning season,

W&L prepped for the season
with two scrimmages, trouncing
Radford, 8-2, and downing a Ger-
man team from Lynchburg, 5-2.
Sharp passing and strong defen-
sive play were evident in both
scrimmages. Lyles hopes such
play will continue throughout the
season.

W&L will use a 3-4-3 formation,
in hopes to dominate the midfield
play while getting the ball to the

attack, Lettermen Billy Cogar,
Doug Hunter, and Jembe Mwa-
kalu, a Kenyan transfer student,
will hold down the front line
spots. Tri-captain Jim Fox, Chuck
Alexander, and John Embree will
anchor the midfield, while all-
state selection Barclay Arm-
strong, another tricaptain, will
head up the defense, Paul Devine,
the third tri-captain, will mind
the nets for the third year. Lyles
feels that sophomores Jeff Barr
and Bob Currie, and junior Jim
Wilson will provide more depth
than the squad had last year.

The Generals open their season
tomorrow against West Virginia
Wesleyan, a newcomer to the
W&L schedule. Lyles is hoping
for a strong start which would
help to carry the spirit and hus-
tle which have marked the pre-
season practice sessions,

early in the third period, After
freshman defensive end Jeff Slat-
coff recovered a Millersville fum-
ble at the W&L 48, the Generals
drove to the Millersville 14, where
after hauling in a Berry pass,
Perry fumbled the ball, with the
Marauders recovering.

But on the next play freshman
linebacker Craig Forry picked off
his second pass of the day and
rambled to the Millersville four.
Three plays later Berry found
George wide open over the mid-
die for the only W&L touchdown.
A pass for a two-point conversion
was picked off, and the Generals
trailed 19-6,

Then Millersville put the game
out of reach. After Berry was
picked off for the second of three
times, the Marauders made it 27-
6 as Steve Schaufert scored from
three yards out, and Gerry Nau
hit Bob Ulrich for the two-point-
er. Brunner closed out the scor-
ing midway through the fourth
quarter with a 22-yard field goal.
