LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, APRIL 17, 1975

 

WéeLca

The American Revolution Bi-
centennial Administration has
designated Washington and Lee
University, the second-oldest col-
lege in Virginia and the sixth-
oldest in America, as a Bicenten-
nial College Campus.

The university is only the sec-
ond Virginia institution to re-
ceive the designation, The Col-
lege of William and Mary was
similarly honored earlier this
year,

W&L was founded in 1749—27
years before the signing of the
Declaration of Independence.

On May 13, 1776, it became
the first academic institution in
the Colonies to cast its lot with
the growing sentiment in favor
of independence, when trustees
of what was then called Augusta
Academy formally renamed the
school ‘‘Liberty Hall.”

Among the projects in Wash-
ington and Lee’s officially en-
dorsed American Bicentennial
program are these:

—The current nationwide tour

of a number of historic portraits
once owned by the families of
George Washington and Robert
E. Lee, including the priceless
first portrait ever to have been
painted of Washington himself;

—Another two-year national
tour, sponsored by the Smith-
sonian Institution, of some 200
pieces of rare Chinese export
porcelain from the 18th and
early-19th centuries, all with
decorations reflecting Revolu-
tionary-era political, cultural,
economic, religious and aesthetic
influences;

—An intensive, professionally
directed archaeological “dig” now
being conducted at the ruins of
Liberty Hall Academy, the re-
sults of which are expected to
provide new evidence about aca-
demic life two centuries ago;

—The 1976 Mock Democratic
Convention being planned by
W&L's student body, already
recognized on its own as a Vir-
ginia Bicentennial Event;

—And completion in 1976 of

Applications exceed
law seats by 13-1

A total of 1,050 applications
for admission to the law school—
more than 13 applications for
every available place in next
fall’s first-year class—was re-
corded by W&L this spring.

Reflecting a nationwide trend,
the total number of applications
was down about 9 per cent, from
1,150 a year ago. But according
to a report this week from Roy
L, Steinheimer Jr., dean of the
School of Law, the quality of
applicants was up significantly.
“The class we have admitted for
September should be the best
we have ever had,” he said.

About a quarter of the 80 first-
year students next fall will be
women, Steinheimer reported.
The law school is the only di-
vision to admit women. It be-
eame fully coeducational in 1972,
and will graduate its first women
students next month,

The 1,050 applications receiv-

ed for 1975 admission came from
students in 275 undergraduate
institutions in 46 states, Stein-
heimer reported.

He attributed the increase in
the quality of applicants this
year largely to “self-selection” —
an increased awareness among
potential applicants of W&L’'s
selectivity. Because of the uni-
versity’s unusually high admis-
sions standards, the dean said,
marginal students appear to be
ruling themselves out, and not
even applying.

Contributing to the modest de-
cline in the overall number of
applications is the well-publiciz-
ed “glut” of law-school gradu-
ates, Steinheimer said. Last
month the U.S. Labor Depart-
ment predicted the number of
law graduates will continue to
outpace nationwide demand for
new lawyers at least through
1985.

the initial portion of W&L’s “De-
velopment Program for the
1970s,” by raising $36 million, of
which more than 75 per cent has
been realized already.

In addition, the university
radio station, WLUR-FM, re-
cently became the first college
broadcast facility in the nation
to join the national Bicentennial
College Network. WLUR’s three-
times-a-week feature program,
“Bicentennial Reports,” is made
available to ther members of the
network under ARBA sponsor-
ship.

Washington and Lee’s Ameri-

can Bicentennial program is
closely aligned with the joint
Lexington and Rockbridge

County Bicentennial observance,
directed by Dr. Leon F. Sensa-
baugh, a professor of history and
dean emeritus of Washington
and Lee.

The university officially began
its commemoration of the Ameri-
can Revolution in 1973 with the
dedication of its Front Campus

mpusrecognized .

as a National Historic Landmark
and publication of a brief il-
lustrated architectural history of
its historic academic buildings.

With the Front Campus nam-
ed a National Landmark two
years ago and the Lee Chapel
similarly recognized in 1963,
W&L is one of the few college
campuses in America naving re-
ceived two such designations—
the highest that can be con-
ferred on a private site by the
federal government. Interesting-
ly, Virginia Military Institute,
founded in 1839 and adjoining
the W&L campus, in Lexington,
is one of the others with two
Historic Landmarks.

The school was renamed Wash-
ington Academy in 1798, in
gratitude for George Washing-
ton’s generous endowment to the
struggling college. His gift still is
a part of W&L’s endowment fund.

Robert E. Lee accepted the job
as president of the University
afte rthe Civil War because of
his admiration for Washington.

On Tuesday, April 8, Robert Carl Peniston died after
a heart failure suffered in Richmond. He was to have
graduated next month with a Bachelor of Science de-
gree in business administration. He was a Dean's List
student and an active member of Phi Kappa Sigma fra-

The funeral service was conducted last Friday in
RK. I. Lee Memorial Church on campus by the Reverand
LD). Holmes Irving, pastor, and Captain Charles I. Keyser,
staff chaplain at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola
where Peniston’s father, Captain Robert C. Peniston, is
stationed. The burial followed in Stonewall Jackson
Cemetery, Lexington. He is survived by his parents and
a sister, Lisa Peniston, a sophomore at Randolph-Macon
Woman's College in Lynchburg.

Peniston’s career here was in many ways an exemplar
of what remained of the old school W&L. We remember
being told when we first arrived on campus that W&L
was the type of school at which men partied hard on
the weekends and studied hard during the week. If any-
one still here lived up to that description it was Peniston,
lle was a good student and a good man who took ad-
vantage of the opportunity afforded him at W&L, and
he will be remembered and missed by those who knew
him for a long time to come.

 

 

 

 

 

‘Changing Room’ termed realistic

By MIKE FERRARA

The University Theatre pre-
sented to the W&L community
(right before finals) its pro-
duction of The Changing Room,
This play, written by David
Storey, revolved around the
rough sport of rugby, as played
by the lower-classes in England.

All the “action” of the play
took place not on the rugby
field, but in the locker room,
where we witnessed various ex-
changes between the different
members of the team. We saw the
old lazy janitor speak of the
Communist menace with the
pompous “Patsy.” and the hard-

Jim Overton
lectures Don Hogle

as the owner of the rugby team
John Moore
and Derrick Woods on the finer points o/ beat-

working but unlucky “Kenny”
treasure his newly-purchased
power tools—to be used to make
shelves to house books he does
not have. The audience laughed
with the outspoken but slightly
obnoxius “Walsh,” and sympa-
thized with “Sandy,” the assist-
ant trainer, who took the blame
for another's misconduct. We
began to judge Sir Frederick, the
club owner, for his somewhat
eallous and aloof attitude, and
in general, we proceeded to get
involved in this slice of these
men's lives, a slice which we per-
ceived was not enjoyed by some
of them as sport, but treated as

a part of their economic survival.

These reactions on the part of
the audience showed the achieve-
ment of the actors in portraying
the desired characters. If the dif-
ferent personalities had not
seemed real, the play certainly
would have been very dull to
watch. But fortunately. one re-
ceived that certain flavor (and
aroma) of a men’s locker room,
along with the antics and crises
that usually develop in such
places, from the comical urgings
of “Walsh” in the shower to the
calming presence of the trainer
when a player's nose was broken

lift). Of course, these occurences
are all quite familiar to your
average W&L jock. but some
things about the play were rather
foreign to the Lexington stage.

The Changing Room was uni-
que in several respects. First of
all, it was done without a lot of
physical action by the players.
Everything the audience saw took
place in the locker room: this
eonsisted mainly of each of the
characters interacting with one
another in fast-paced dialogue
The play was not trying to con-
vey a deep “message,"’ except the
one conveyed by the everyday
occurances in the rugby player's
lives. Secondly, there was a bit
of nudity in the play, which
greatly enhanced the sense of
realism already established by
the excellent and accurate sets
utilized in the production. The
Drama Division should be com-
mended for pulling something
like that off ‘pun intended) in
conservative old Lexington
Thirdly the actors had to learn
Yorkshire accents for the per-
formance, a very difficult task
indeed. The accents were con-
vinicing to the extent that one
could not understand what was
being said half the time, but they
did tend to deteriorate toward
the end of the play.

Despite their faltering accents

the entire cast should be con-
gratulated on a fine job. The
production Was thoroughly en-
joyed by nearly everyone who

Was able to see it in the Theatre's
cramped quarters. It has been
suggested, though, that the play
be updated to include a co-ed
room; that would really
get the town in a frenzy df you
can imagine that). I personally
think it Was enough to bring
such a new and different play
to Lexington. in order to eive

Unfriendliness at the
Law School

We understand that several students were forced to leave
a Law School party last Saturday night. We find it impossible
to understand this action by the responsible parties. The
undergraduate students were told that the party at Zollman’s
was closed to them and that only law students and _ their
dates might attend.

The undergraduate students had brought with them their
own liquor, and were not consuming the alcohol supplied by
the law students and kept at their bar; the undergraduate
students were not drinking liquor that they had not previ-
ously paid for, In addition the undergraduate students offered
to pay an admission fee and were the guests of law students.

We find the expulsion of the students involved unwarranted
and evidence of hypocrisy on the part of the law students
responsible. Members of the Law School are free to attend
parties thrown for and funded by the undergraduate division,
even though law students pay no class dues for such functions,
unlike undergraduate students. Frequently law students show
up at fraternity parties, again using facilities and supplies
paid for by others.

This is not to chastise members of the Law School for
attending such functions. Indeed, most fraternity
parties are open to anyone wishing to attend, as are Uni-
versity parties (usually for a nominal fee). What disturbs
us is the fact that these same law students, supposedly
well-attuned to the inequities in our society and resolved to
correct these faults, have proceeded to ignore these precepts
in their social lives. By expelling undergraduate students
(and there could not have been many, as most students were
still on Spring Break), the law students involved exhibited
an extreme lack of tolerance and fairness.

social

The members of the undergraduate school could retaliate
by closing all future parties to any persons except dues-paying
undergraduates and their dates. Then the law school could
hold its parties exclusively for law students without fear of
appearing hypocritical; each school could party in splendid
isolation from the other. There would be extra work involved
for those who organize the parties, as all guests would have
to be carded and uninvited, i.e. nonpaying, persons asked to
leave. Relations between the two schools would become more
strained than they already are, and the fact that all parties
would be closed would tend to create a more artificial atmos-
phere at these events.

Apparently this is the course of action desired hy those
members of the Law School who were involved. By their action
they have indicated that although they may come to our
parties, we are not the most welcome of guests at their
gatherings. We feel that, in all due fairness to the undergradu-
such action is uncalled for and fosters more ill
feeling between the two divisions—mutual animosity we do
not need. Admittedly, we find it rather difficult to believe
that any undergraduates would want to attend a party spon-
sored by the Law School in the first place, but if that is the
case, they should be welcomed or, at least, allowed to remain.

Ramey joins administration

 

 

 

Thomas B. Ramey III, a senior at W&L, has been appointed
assistant admissions director for 1975-76.

Periodically Washington and Lee employs a new graduate as
an admissions assistant. Like his predecessors, Ramey will also

be assistant dean of students.

Ramey is a Dean's list student, president of the Interfrat-
ernity Council, a member of Sigma Chi fraternity, and a dormitory
counselor. He will receive his B.S. in business administration this

May.

In his new post, which he will assume in mid-August, Ramey
will be a member of the admissions and financial-aid committees.
He will travel extensively to secondary schools throughout the
nation and will conduct on-campus interviews with prospective

students.

Local policeman
silences student

March 20, 1975
To the Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

I feel it is my duty and honor
to leak the true story of the Lex-
ington One. Today I was leisurely
strolling down Washington Street
on my way to dinner. En route
I passed, as always, this City’s
hallowed citadel of Law and
Order, Lexington City Hall. This
center of Propriety and Good
Works controls the vast army of
Lexington Policemen. I passed
this building, as always, with all
due Respect.

Having lived in this City for
three years. I am no longer
amazed when I am passed by
four Police Cars, eagle eyes ready
to locate every breach of moral
law peering out of Them, on each
and every block. Also, I have
come to accept the fact that
there are, maybe, 3000 college
students in this town, most of
whom I am sure are actively
plotting the fall of City Govern-
ment.

In light of this, 1 was not
particularly bothered when, on
the way to dinner, the usual
liberal ration of Police Cars
passed by. However, the sight of
that noble, ubiquitous three-
wheeler that looks like an ice
cream truck, but actually is an
instrument of Law Enforcement,
amused me so much that I point-
ed this hilarious riot preventing
device out to my companions.
and began to laugh.

The three of us took another
ten steps or so, in which time
we heard the now past Cushman
make an illegal “U" turn and

CW. POST

 

accelerate to its top speed,
rumored to be more than twenty
miles an hour. In what seemed
like the twinkling of an eye, but
was probably more like five sec-
onds, the Cushman had caught
up to us.

The Vehicle stopped, and a
voice called out of it, ordering my
friends on, but detaining me.
This Enforcer of the Law told me
that my acts of pointing and
laughing could land me in jail.
I was told that this obviously
intelligent, learned man felt
“stupid” and “ignorant” when
my illegal act was directed at
him, (Premeditated Laughter?)
Henceforth, he said, if 1 wanted
to be “safe” in Lexington, I must
keep my “hands in my pockets”
and “always look straight ahead.”

In light of my greivous crime,
I feel fortunate to have been
allowed to go to dinner by this
more-than-generous Policeman.
Indeed, I am so thankful that 1,
once a hardened criminal, have
repented, and now I beg my fel-
low students, for their own
safety, to refrain from such
crimes as Laughing in Public,
Laughing with Malice of Fore-
thought, or Laughing with the
Intent to Amuse.

Respectfully,
Michael Spaulding, ‘76
cc: City Manager

Your encounter with the boys
in blue uniforms does not sur-
prise us in the least. However,
the fact that you have sent a
letter to City Manager John

will be well received, and this
is not the ease. Mr. Doane ap-

Ask Traveller

 

DEAR TRAVELLER—I can’t take it any longer. I don’t mind putting
up with the food at the Commons, but it just got to be too
much when they decided to co-sponsor (with the SAB) a cream-
ed corn chugging contest. And I wouldn’t have minded the
Polish-American meal last week, but it’s tough to eat kielbasa
with a rubber fork. Are there any places in town which might
lend a friendlier and more palatable atmosphere?

(Signed) C. Wagon

DEAR CHUCK-—Dining out in greater Lexington can be a real treat,
if you know where to go. Many a gourmet has traveled hundreds
of miles just to feast upon the specialties of the houses in Lex-

ington’s finer

establishments. Some of those establishments

and their choicest offerings include:

—Uncle Bob's Place Uocated behind Lee Chapel). Featur-
ing the finest recipes from Paris, London, Rome, and Hartz
Mountain, Dine in the elegance of the Lee mausoleum, Ask
for “Revenuer Stew,” a fine recipe from the backwoods of the

Blue Ridge Mountains.

—Fred’s Oceanview Inn (ocated atop House Mountain).
Dine next to the magnificent Olympic sized pool of imported
ocean water. The more daring adventurers can swim the pool
and catch their dinner from the selection of moray eel, shark,
man-o’-war jellyfish, and other delicacies available.

—Penneyburgers (located east of West Lexington, or is it
west of East Lexington). Name refers to size, not price, of their
speciality. Also features fried chick-'n’-rats, a popular South-
ern recipe, along with fried milkshakes. The Alpo labels on the
floor add to the general decor.

— Sue's Ice Cream and Massage Parlor (in Roanoke). Ask

for the double-dip special.

DEAR TRAVELLER—What do I get for the man who has every-

thing?

Letters to the Editor...

intimidate all the members of the
Lexington community; he is at-
tempting to make this once
sleepy little hamlet resemble
Times Square. After saturating
the downtown area with stop
lights and one-way streets, ply-
wood obstructions and torn-up
streets, he is now invading the
suburbs, eg., his maze of stop
lights at the corner of Houston
and Main. We doubt that a man
who makes it a chore for citizens
to drive through Lexington will
show much concern for a student
who cannot walk the streets and
talk to his friends without being
accosted.

Campaign practices

violate privacy

To the Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

On returning to our house on
Thornhill Road this past Sunday,
‘March 22), we discovered cam-
paign flyers, for a certain candi-
date for Senior E.C. Representa-
tive. in each of our bedrooms.
The house had been left with
both doors closed. Will there
never be an end to the assault on
our privacy, our sensibilities, and
our pursuit of what passes for
happiness at W&L? Not to men-
tion the waste of paper. It's bad
enough to have these aspiring
puppy politicos disrupting fra-
ternal meais with their mean-
ingless harangues, plastering
their worthless “democratic”
trash on frat house walls, and
calling time after time to deliver
their wasted spiel. But what
gives them the right to enter our
private residence, with neither
our presence nor our permission
nor even our acquaintance, and

Alterations in cheers
suggested by student

To the Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

The word is out, W&L fans
are going to “clean up their act.”
However, since W&L fans are
not about to lose their status as
the nation’s number one lacrosse
fans. we must learn to rely on
creativity instead of obscenity.
In some instances, old cheers
can be revived through new
words. For instance, instead of
“Go to hell, Navy, go to hell,”
an afternoon at Wilson Field
might turn up “Get thee hence,
Navy, get thee hence.” Similarly,
“What the hell's a Wahoo?”
might reappear as “Can you de-
fine a Wahoo?’ What to do about
comments about the referee re-
mains a distinct problem, as the
black and white striped seems
to Craw out the vilest nature of
fans, and how many times dur-
ing a game can the fan call out
“Ref beats his wife,” before the
boos are directed at him.

Pan drunkedness can be easily
conquered by refusing admittance
to Sigma Nus (who are always

drunk), and not letting the
SAE's finish their beer at the
gate.

Outlook on the world of college lacrosse

HOW TO FILL SPACE IN
THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE
PHI IN ALMOST A MONTH
WHEN YOU DON’T HAVE
MUCH TO WRITE ABOUT
OTHER THAN OLD NEWS:

It took a while to come up
with a solution to this problem.
However, after consultation with
advisers in Baltimore, Long
Island, and Muleshoe, Texas, the
answer was obvious: try to fill
the folks in on how the wacky,
messed-up world of college la-
crosse stands today.

When you left for your vaca-
tions on the Florida beaches or
in your home living rooms, things
were already in turmoil, New
names like Morgan State, Penn
State, UMBC, and Roanoke were
competing for headline space
with John Hopkins, Cornell, and
Maryland.

Now it’s gotten even more com-
plicated, There are no fewer than
12 teams in competition for the
NCAA Division I tournament
berths. while at least 10 teams
have a legitimate chance for bids
in the College Division.

What we thought we would do
this week was to provide you
with a capsule look at the con-
tenders to Johns Hopkins’ crown
in Division I, in the order of the
latest United States Intercollegi-
ate Lacrosse Association’s (USI
LA) poll.

The top twelve:

1. JOHNS HOPKINS (5-0):
The Blue Jays are back with
another powerhouse to defend
their 1974 title. Observers call the
1975 Jays their “most aggressive
and best stickworking team in
several years.” First-year coach

ee

neh Ae Ne
he te

 

Henry Cicciarone has the ser-
vices of one of the nation’s most
balanced attacks in Franz Wit-
tlesberger, Rich Hirsch, and
freshman Mike O'Neill.
Dale Kohler, Tom Myrick, and
Don Zimmerman lead a deep
group of midfielders, while sopho-
more Kevin Mahon returns in
goal. The only question mark for
Hopkins lies with the close de-
fense, where graduation cost the
Jays two starters. The defense
will be severely tested Saturday
when Hopkins collides with num-
ber two Cornell. Also left on the
Hopkins schedule are games with
Navy, Army, Brown, and Mary-
land (May 17).

9. CORNELL (7-0): The Big
Red, NCAA champions in 1972,
could take the title north of the
Mason-Dixon line again if their
defense comes together, Cornell
coach Richie Moran can _ boast
to having the most explosive at-
tack in college lacrosse, with
Canadian Mike French pairing
up with sophomore phenom
Eamon McEaneany for an aver-
age of eight goals a game. Add
to that other first-line players
like Jon Levine and middies Bill
Marino and Tom Dolan and its
no wonder why Cornell scores so
much. The Big Red’s weakness,
like Hopkins, is an untested de-
fense. The loss of second-team
All-American goalie Mike Em-
merich had to hurt. The show-
down with Hopkins on Saturday
could tell a lot. Also left for
Cornell are games with Cortland
State, Penn and Princeton.

3. MARYLAND (2-0): The
Terps play the lightest schedule
of anyone in the top 12, which

helps in the way of experience.
But Buddy Bearmore’s troops
have seen two NCAA title games
running, so the lack of playing
time shouldn’t hurt. What has
hurt are injuries to key players
like attackman Ed Mullen (out
for the year following knee surg-
ery), middies Frank Urso, Roger
Tuck, and Doug Radebaugh (all
playing with nagging injuries),
defenseman Tom Murray
(broken leg), and goalie Gary
Niels (sprained ankle). Junior
college transfer Bert Caswell car-
ries much of the scoring load for
Maryland, while Urso and Tuck
chip in for a few points each
game. Mike Farrell, an All-
American last year, anchors the
Terp defense. Sophomore Jake
Reed, the victim of the Johns
Hopkins barrage in last year’s
title game has replaced Niels in
goal, Left on the Maryland sched-
ule are Virginia (this Saturday
in Charlottesville), Navy, Army,
and Johns Hopkins.

4, VIRGINIA (5-2): A one-
goal overtime loss to Johns
Hopkins in the season opener
and a two-goal setback at the
hands of Maryland-Baltimore
County are the only blemishes
so far on the Cavaliers’ season
slate. But the Wahoos have not
won a game over a top team yet—
their first chance comes Satur-
day against Maryland in Charlot-
tesville. The team’s top-player to
date is goalie Rodney Rullman,
who is playing up to his full
potential after two years of up
and down play. The rest of the
team is good, but there is no
one star player who carries the
offensive load. Left for the Cavs
are matches with Maryland,
Towson State, Navy, and W&L.

5. HOFSTRA (5-1): They lost
their opener to Penn, 17-3 (that’s
right, by 14 goals), then turned
around to beat Towson State by
five, Princeton by 12, yes sir, 12,
and W&L and Army by one goal
in overtime games. The Hofstra
zone defense still gives opponents
fits, and players like Phil Marino,
Bob Hiller, and Tom Calder would
like nothing more than to give
25-year head coach Howdy Myers
a national title as a going-away
present. Hofstra still has games
with Navy and Rutgers left.

6. PRINCETON (4-2); Basic-
ally the same team that beat
W&L on March 25, 11-7. They've
picked up one goal wins over
North Carolina and Navy since
tnen, but have also been blown-
out victims of Hopkins (22-11)
and Hofstra (17-5). The Tigers
are young and should be watched
in the future. To get to the
tournament Princeton needs to
play well from here on out
against Army, Penn, Brown,
Rutgers, and Cornell.

and Lee came close to the Mid-
shipmen as far as scheduling
as many top teams as possible.
But the Middies, 14-8 winners
over the Generals on March 28,
get the nod for the roughest
schedule around, Every team in
the top ten this week except
Brown shows up on the Navy
slate. Add to that the number
two and three college division
teams this week, Towson State
and UMBC, and it’s obvious why
Dick Szlasa has to get his team
in tip-top shape. Midfielder Bob
DeSimone, a clinch All-American
who personally beat W&L with
seven goals, leads a cast of hun-
dreds at midfield. All-American
Jake Lawlor gets the job done
on defense, while Jeff Long leads
the attack. Goalie Bill Mueller’s
ankle injury cost Navy a chance
against Cornell as well as the
Princeton game (15-14).

8. RUTGERS: The Scarlet
Knights have good talent but not
enough of it—after the first wave
there is little backing up. Mike
Rink and John Dinowski com-
bine for a strong attack, while
Rick Fornaro leads the midfields.
Rutgers is one of the teams W&L
must beat to stay alive—that
game comes up on May 10. Rutg-
ers also has games against Navy,
Penn State, and Princeton left
on their schedule.

9. BROWN: Here could lie the
real sleeper of the top 12. The
same that holds true for Hopkins
and Cornell goes here—Brown
has a potent offense, led by Tom
Rothman, Steve Meister, and Bob
Mueller, but lacks talent and ex-
perience on defense, Their low-

est goal output of the year was
12 against Cornell, but they
yielded 17 in the same game.
Brown has yet to face Johns
Hopkins, Penn, and Massachu-
setts.

10. WASHINGTON AND LEE
(4-4): See for yourself against
the Maryland Lacrosse Club on
Saturday, North Carolina State
on Sunday, and, if you can make
the trip to Chapel Hill, against
North Carolina on Wednesday.

A word of caution—you might
not be seeing the team you saw
before the spring break.

11 and 12. PENN and NORTH
CAROLINA: Penn has to win its
last three games against Prince-
ton, Cornell, and Brown to stand
a chance of getting a tournament
pid, while UNC, now 3-7 on the
year, has had no luck whatso-
ever. It’s the Tar Heels best team
ever, but that doesn’t necessarily
mean that wins come for just
the asking,

Tennis up to 10-4 mark;
other teams lag behind

To catch up on what has hap-
pened in past weeks:

W&L’s lacrosse Generals are
now 4-4 after a 14-13 sudden
death loss to Hofstra and a 15-
10 win over Cortland State on
the annual spring trip.

Bob Hiller’s fourth goal of the
game almost four minutes into
the sudden death period was the
winning tally for Hofstra, who
won their fourth in a row.

Rob Morgan led W&L with four
goals. Dave Warfield, in his first
game since recovering from a
knee injury, added two goals and
four assists.

Morgan scored seven times
while Warfield added four goals
and three assists in leading the
Generals to a second straight win
over Cortland State.

Trailing 6-4 at intermission,
W&L got fine performances from
faceoff specialist Brent Miller
and all three midfields to turn
the game around in the second
half. The Generals scored the
last six goals of the game.

The tennis Generals are 10-4
on the year following Tuesday's
5-4 win over Virginia Tech.

W&L’s spring trip to Florida
saw three matches cancelled due
to a tack of contractual agree-

The baseball Generals’ slump
continues, as W&L dropped a
doubleheader Tuesday to Bridge-
water, 10-6 and 15-4,

W&L is now 2-13 on the year,
and are currently in the midst
of a five-game losing streak.

Washington and Lee’s golf
team finished seventh overall and
fourth among college division
teams in the annual state tourna-
ment at The Homestead in Hot
Springs last weekend.

Led py Jerry Maatman’s 81-
77—-158, the Generals compiled
a team score of 658 to place
fourth in the college division be-
hind Hampden-Sydney (626),
Madison (635) and George Ma-
son (642). A total of 16 Virginia
colleges competed in the event.

Washington and Lee won six
events but dropped an 87-58
track meet to Davidson College
last weekend.

W&L also competed in the
Davidson Relays, with the spring
mediey team placing second and
the 880 team gaining a fourth
place. Seventeen teams competed
in the event.

Unlike most sports, the lacrosse
world is a very tight-knit group
of coaches and officials who have
been close friends for many years.

Unknowingly, I am sure, the
W&L fans were beginning to un-

ravel some of these threads, to

the detriment of their coaches
and players who were working
so hard to promote lacrosse.
Respect for any opponent can
only enhance W&L's position in

been at one time the only W&L

with the success of lacrosse at

easier to give Washington and

serves.
