W@L lacrosse coach Jack Emmer

Emmer presents
Contact reschedules Kilpatrick

By ROBERT LUTZ

Contact °75 will extend its
yearly lecture series with a special
presentation entitled ‘Australia
14—W&L °75” to be given by
W&L lacrosse coach Jack Emmer
on Wednesday, May 14 at 7:30
p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Coach Emmer’s speech will
focus on “what it takes to be a
W&L lacrosse player,” as well as
the recent history and current
status of the W&L lacrosse pro-
gram. Emmer, _ thrice-named
Coach of the Year, notes that
the program has been largely
dependent on student support
and plans to discuss this year’s
relative lack of success, as well
as his expectations for the future.
He feels that the presentation
will be both interesting and en-
tertaining for all members of
the W&L community.

In conjunction with Emmer’s
talk, a multi-media show with
music and slides will be pre-
sented on last summer’s Austral-
jan World Games Tour made by
Coach Emmer along with de-

Mock Democratic conventions
very successful over the years

By REED MORGAN
Washington and Lee Mock
Convention picks Bentsen, or

Udall, or Carter, or Harris, or
Jackson, or Carter, or perhaps
a dark horse candidate such as
Florida Governor Reubin Askew,
or Walter Mondale,

One year from today, the 1976
Mock Democratic National Con-
vention will attempt to predict
the Democrat's choice for the
next presidential election. Hav-
ing convened the night before to
hear nationally prominent poli-
ticians address the needs of the
future, having debated and re-
solved the platform (which, in its
final form, reflects student
opinion), and having heard
nominating speeches for all the
candidates, the results of three
years of meticulous planning will
begin to show.

The Mock Convention began in
1908, inspired by William Jen-
nings Bryan's visit to Lexington
that year. The convention's
choice of Bryan then was correct.
In 1912, the tradition was begun
of holding the convention for
the party out of the White House.
The mock Democrats were wrong,

twenty-third ballot even. It took
the real convention one hundred
and three ballots. The conven-
tion was correct in its 1928 and
1932 picks of, respectively, Al
Smith and F.D.R. The next
Democratic convention conven-
ed in 1952, and predicted the
choice of Adlai Stevenson, John
Kennedy took the nomination in
1960.

The W&L convention was
wrong in 1972, on a Democrat
that time, for the first time in
twenty years. McGovern came to
within twenty-six votes of win-
ning the third ballot, and Ken-
nedy was drafted on the seventh.
What happened is a topic of
much debate and little agree-
ment. The convention barely
missed McGovern, miscalculated,
and was mistaken. The conven-
tion's choice, erroneous as it now
appears, was reported typically
by Time ‘(one full column), the
National Observer (one third of
a page), and hundreds of papers
across the nation.

W&L's record has been better
with the Democrats, perhaps be-
cause there has been a more na-
tural objectivity on the part of

Monday's

By JOE FITZGERALD
The Phi News Staff

The Executive Committee an-
nounced the winners and run-
off candidates for the University
Council Monday night. Run-off
elections were scheduled to be
held Wednesday.

Keith Crocker and _ Scott
Stevenson won two of the senior
seats on the U.C. The third was
to be decided by a run-off be-

tween Bob Graham and Jim
Pearson.

Woody Woodell and Ken
Voelker won the junior seats.

George Griffin, John Wheatley,
Steve Marzo, and David Low
were placed in the run-offs for
the sophomore seats on the coun-
cil.

In other business, the E.C,
heard a report from Jay Duriv-
age of the Cold Check Commit-
tee concerning the possible need
for more than the $270 left in
their budget for covering bad
checks for the remainder of the
year.

The E.C. agreed to support the
committee if their present funds
are not adequate.

Durivage also reported that
seniors who owe money to the
committee when they graduate
will not be given transcripts from
the university until the debt is
settled. Underclassmen who have
not paid for bad checks will not
be allowed to matriculate in the
fall.

Also, the E.C. voted to set up
a reserve fund to hold the money
left over from the Student Ac-
tivities Board budget at the end
of the year. The funds forming
the reserve are expected to total
$600. Without the special re-
serve fund the money would re-
vert back to the student body
reserve fund.

John Killpack and David Mat-
thews, outgoing co-chairmen of
the SAB, also reported that gate
receipts from the Four Tops con-
cert exceeded expectations by
$400.

In other business, Scott Prank-
lin and Sandy Stradtman re-
ported on an Honor Seminar that
they attend at U.Va. during
the spring break. The schools

IREVIEW andOuTLooxl “The Last Road Trip”

Integrity in the Dining Hall

A subcommittee reported back to the Student Executive
Committee last Monday night on the results of a question-
naire given to freshmen concerning certain policies in Evans
Dining Hall. The questions on the form dealt with the problem
of non-contract students taking meals without paying for
them, with contract students taking extra food for their
friends, and with students taking only salads or drinks with-
out paying. The freshmen polled were asked whether or not
they were aware of the policies and what means should be
used to insure that regulations are followed.

Our faith in the continued existence of the Honor System
at Washington and Lee has been shaken. When asked if
they were aware of current policy, 251 out of a total of 293
persons polled replied in the affirmative. The rest either re-
sponded that they were unaware of any policy or did not
care to comment. When asked what means should be used
to enforce the rules, 125 out of 244 students answered that
persons caught taking food without paying should be dealt
with by the Executive Commitee as a violator of the Honor
System.

Sixty-two students felt that the issuance of contract passes
which must be shown to the checker at every meal was a
reasonable way to control any problems, Another thirty-seven
students indicated their approval of the use of machines to
check identification cards which would have to be displayed
at every meal. The remaining twenty students proposed vari-
ous other ideas, most of which were impractical or facetious.

Only slightly over half of those students questioned show-
ed a preference toward treating the deliberate stealing of food
in the dining hall as an offense of honor, Only one half.
The rest would rather see the instalation of machines and
turnstiles and more checkers, an affront to one of the few
college campuses which still proclaims itself as an adherent
of an Honor System, As the system in the dining hall now
stands, the basic assumption is that W&L students are honest ;
a large per centage of those same students do not seem to
believe in this premise.

We would like to think that those students who indicated
dissatisfaction with the policy of treating the taking of food
as an Honor violation do basically support the Honor System
but we are not convinced, Several of the persons voicing
disapproval felt that current policy should be publicized more,
that those who took food without paying just were not aware
that such an action was dishonest. Others wrote that the
offending students should be dealt with by the Executive
Council, but should not be asked to leave the University for
such a minor offense,

If these replies are any indication of the moral attitude of
even some of the students attending Washington and Lee,
then we as a student body are in sad shape. If the integrity
of a student, or the lack of it, allows him to cheat the dining
hall here, or if mechanical paraphernalia is needed to keep
him from cheating, then what will that same person do when
he is faced with a similar situation later in life?

Even closer to the present, what will that same student
do when given the opportunity to cheat on a test or plagiarize
a term paper?

Recently a conference on student conduct was held at the
University of Virginia. Representatives from Washington and
Lee were present to offer their views on honor systems in
general and on the establishment of acceptable standards
of student conduct. In small group discussions the use of
such terms as honor and integrity were restricted because the
definitions of such terms are so “nebulous.” Now really. Is
honor such an ephemeral concept that it escapes definition?

We think not. Further, we think that most students, if
they stopped to think about it, would prefer to live under
a system where honesty and integrity were basic components
of one's code of behavior. We hope that those students who
responded to the questionnaire stating their belief in the
Honor System consistently support it, and that those who
do not can be convinced by others that honor is a concept
worth preserving at Washington and Lee. —S.C.Y.

By MIKE FERRARA

It has been said by some that
Washington and Lee is one of
the finest institutions of learn-
ing in the country, Of course,
they never say what you learn
at W&L. Unfortunately, W&L is
not co-educational, and your
average hot-blooded — scholar
spends a good deal of his time
searching for truth and knowl-
edge beyond his mountain re-
treat in Lexington. For here at
historic Washington and Lee we
have both academic excellence
and social deprivation. This de-
privation is very convieniently
glossed over in The Catalogue.
It states very matter-of-factly:

Washington and Lee men
have little trouble finding
dates. A number of women’s
colleges are nearby. To the
north are Mary Baldwin Col-
lege and Madison College; to
the east are Sweet Briar Col-
lege, Randolph-Macon Wo-
man's College, and Southern
Seminary Junior College; and
to the south is Hollins College.
A variety of social and other
activities are sponsored in con-
junction with these women’s
colleges.

The time of year when a lot
of the “variety of social and
other activities” take place is
during the Spring Term, and
since there are only six weeks
in that term, one must make the
most of his precious time. And
as the term comes to a close,
your basic W&L stud takes to

the road for that last nostalgic
trip to his favorite nesting place.

These havens for the harried
student are just waiting for you
to get your sweaty little hands
on them. Road trips are certainly
essential for your sanity at W&L,
because if you stay here long
enough you will think the whole
world is male (and when you go
on that last road trip in the
Spring, observing a women’s col-
lege, you will think the whole
world is male there too).

That virile playboy has two
choices for his last adventure in
ecstasy in the Spring. He can
go down the road on the week-
end, or during the week. The
middle of the week is more pro-
ductive, being the time tuna
are most abundant, Most of the
fisheries have their dances dur-
ing the week as well. These
dances usually involve paying a
dollar to walk around the gym
and look stupid, as opposed to
doing it for free the rest of the
time.

By the time Spring finally rolls
around, you will be able to look
up and old “friend.” This is a girl
you talked with for five minutes
at a mixer one night where
you managed to wrench her
name and dorm number out.
When you ask if she wants to
share with you some last sizzl-
ing seconds before you go home,
you'll get an excuse like, “My
grandmother just died, and I
have to fly to Charleston right
now to pay my respects.’ But

Students, faculty author
science research papers

Eight faculty members and 17
students are authors or co-auth-
ors of research papers to be de-
livered at the upcoming annual
meeting of the Virginia Academy
of Sciences.

The research papers largely re-
port the results of scientific in-
vestigation undertaken by the
students and teachers under
W&L's Robert E. Lee Research
Program, which each year sup-
ports advanced scholarly projects
by a large number of students
under individual directors from
the faculty.

Papers will be presented to the
V.AS. in physics, chemistry and
psychology. The annual meeting
takes place this week at Madi-
son College in Harrisonburg.

In physics, research reports
will be delivered on electron
spectroscopy, a method of ana-
lyzing physical substances, by Dr.
W. Barlow Newbolt with two stu-
dents and on the deuteron, an
atomic particle, by Dr, Harry T.
Williams and one student.

In chemistry, a paper prepared
by five students under Dr. J.
Keith Shillington on oxidization
of a chemical compound will be
presented. Also in chemistry,
papers will be delivered on or-
ganic cage compounds by Dr.
George S. Whitney and a stu-
dent researcher and on employ-
ing the computer in chemistry by
Drs. John H. Wise and J. Brown
Goehring.

Four papers will be presented
in the field of psychology — by
Dr. David G. Elmes with two stu-
dents on the role of rehearsal in
behavior, two students on devel-
opment of recognizing and com-

pleting sentences, by Dr. Leo-
nard E, Jarrard with a student
researcher the effects of damage
in the area of the brain known as
the hippocampus, and by three
students under Dr. Jarrard’s di-
rection on the effects of damage
in rat brains.

just hearing an excuse like that
in smooth Southern Slang is
worth the price of admission
alone.

If you are lucky enough to
have a date long enough to drop
her off just prior to dorm-clos-
ing, you are in line for another
treat. When you get to the lobby,
there will be an over-weight ma-
tron giving you dirty looks and
watching your every move. Your
girlfriend will try to give her
a big smile and say: “Good night,
Mrs. Hoffenmuller.’ The old
toad won't get the hint, prob-
ably because the school pays her
not to get the hint and will stay
there with her arms folded. You
will then signal defeat by stretch-
ing out your hand,

Before leaving for the last
time this year, you might feel
nature calling, and proceed to
the men’s room. After getting a
good grasp on the situation, you
hear some keys jingling outside.
Trying to get out, you discover

that one of the Pinkertons have
locked you in. Don't des-
pair though, someone will hear
you screaming, and send you on
your way back to Lexington,
with the strong warning: ‘Don’t
try to hide in there again, son.”
Pinkertons take demonic plea-
sure in throwing men off the
girl’s campuses, especially in the
Spring, mainly because’ they
can't stand seeing you have a
good time while they stand a-
round and gawk.

All these travails during the
last weeks of the school year will
help you study better. Seing the
gentler sex in their natural
habitat will put your mind at
east for finals. And when you
are looking over your gas re-
ceipts for the year, you can think
of all the fun you had. Next
year, you'll probably settle for
those one or two exchange stu-
dents in the library with their
legs crossed, while burning that
certain page in The Catalogue.

Special letter to the editor

Dear Eminent Editor:

I regret to inform you that
your proposal to be invited to
the Annual E.C. Banquet can-
not be approved. As you know
there has always been hostility
between the government and the
press, but speaking for myself,
I am sure the other members of
the Committee would have no
objections if you attend in your
professional capacity, i.e., with
camera, note pad, and pencil.

A distraught EC member
Everett Martin

ca + ae

Mr. Martin:

We are shocked and chagrin-
ned by the fact that the Execu-
tive Committee did not see fit
to invite its friend and ally of
long-standing to Tuesday night's
gala high above the campus in
the Alumni House, We hope that
this year’s EC Banquet gave the
guests dysentery, or at least
dyspepsia. In all honesty, we

think the EC has the right to
wine and dine its members in
the best fashion with delicacies
paid for from the student body
tax, but we also insist that we
be invited to enjoy the fruits of
your graft and corruption, By
failing to invite the eminent
editor, i.e., me, you have struck
the first blow and established for
all time an adversary relation-
ship between the Phi and the
EC.

—JLR

NOTICE

On May 8th at 7 p.m. the
Executive Committee will discuss
the $5-proposal, a suggestion
that every student be allowed to
designate five dollars of his stu-
dent tax to the group or activity
of his choosing. All students are
invited and encouraged to at-
tend.

by the IFC.

April 19, 1975
Dear Dean Canevari:

On behalf of the Interfratern-
ity Council and the student body
of Washington and Lee Univer-
sity, we were most distressed to
learn of the recent incident at
the Rotunda involving the spill-
ing of paint on the marble steps
by Washington and Lee fratern-
ity members on a_ pledging
activity. The matter has been in-
vestigated and sanctions were
taken by the Judicial Board of
the IFC against the social fra-
ternity responsible. The fratern-
ity and the members involved
regret the unfortunate damage
resulting from their thoughtless-
ness and careless behavior.

We were informed that the
University of Virginia incurred
approximately $50 in expense to
repair the damage caused by the
spilled paint. Enclosed is a letter
from the president of the fra-
ternity involved and a check for
$50 to reimburse the school. The
fraternity in question is the
source of this money. If your
expenses exceed $50, we would
appreciate your so advising us.

We wish to stress that the
damage resulted from careless-
ness in carrying out a fraternity
pledge project rather than from
any malicious act or deliberate
intent to cause damage to the
historic Rotunda area. We sin-
eerely regret the occurence of
these acts and hope that the
matter is satisfactorily resolved.
Thank you very much for your
understanding and cooperation.

Your very truly,
Thomas B, Ramey, III
President, IFC

With one of the best records
already in school history, Wash-
ington and Lee’s tennis team will
close out the season this week
with three matches against state
opponents,

Coach Dennis Bussard’s Gen-
erals have a 15-6 mark in dual
matches, the latest a 9-0 sweep
of Madison College.

Coming up this week is a
match today against Roanoke.
Area tennis fans will have a
chance to see some of the best
college players in this area when

2:00 p.m. today,

Designated hitter Maynard Mc-
Corkle hit a grand slam home
run to lead Washington and Lee

Newport News Apprentice last
week.

The Generals dropped the sec-
ond game of the double-header,
3-0 to run the season record to
3-18.

Coach Joe Lyles’ team will
close out the season Thursday
(May 8) by hosting Lynchburg
Baptist College at 3:00 p.m. on

Fordy Gardner shot a three-
over par 74 to win medalist hon-
ors as Washington and Lee
downed Gettysburg, 395-411, in
a golf match Monday at Lex-
ington Country Club.

The victory boosted Coach
Buck Leslie’s team to a 12-2
record for the season. The Gen-
erals closed out the year with a
dual meet here Wednesday (May
7) against Emory & Henry.

Behind Gardner came Jerry
Maatman with a 75, Sandy Avent

Lacrosse Generals hit 7-6 season mark

By BILL FLESHER

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
tournament hopes were dimin-
ished but not demolished Satur-
day when Washington College,
the nation’s second ranked col-
lege division team, handed the
Generals their fourth one-goal
loss of the 1975 season, 15-14.

Coupled with an easy 17-4
romp over William and Mary
earlier in the week, the loss left
W&L with a 7-6 season mark,
a record which ordinarily might
not merit post-season considera-
tion but will because of the many
crazy happenings in college la-
crosse this year,

With just two weeks left in
the regular season, no fewer than
12 teams remain in contention
for the eight berths in the
NCAA-Division I championships.
The Generals are one of those 12.

The week in review:

The Generals ended any doubt
about the outcome of their en-
counter with William and Mary
by scoring nine straight goals
before the Indians scored with
1:32 left in the first half.

Senior attackman Dave War-
field, who personally destroyed
Towson State the Saturday be-
fore with seven goals and four
assists, continued his string of
high-scoring games with six
goals and a pair of assists.

Rob Morgan, W&L’s leading
goal scorer, and freshmen Scott
Baugher and Jay Sindler each
scored twice, while Don Carroll,
Jay Monahan, Ralph Baugher,
Boyd Martin, and Jim Engle-
hart each had a goal.

Carroll added to his team-
leading point total with seven
assists.

Mike Cordrey’s fourth goal of
the game with 3:01 left gave
Washington College a 15-14 win
over W&L Saturday in a game
more than one of the Generals
said they “should have won by
a handful of goals.”

The Shoremen, who earlier in
the week had dropped a 10-8
decision to upstart Salisbury
State, twice rallied behind the
scoring of Cordrey and Myrt

Once again the Generals at-
tack of Morgan (seven goals and
two assists), Warfield (three and
five) and Carroll (one and two)
went unstopped, but in this game
the attack alone wasn’t enough.

W&L had several chances to
send the game into overtime but
could not score in the closing
seconds. The Shoremen wrapped
the win up when goalie Bryan

to go ahead 5-2. After Washing-

put W&L in front 8-4 early in

The teams then traded goals to
send the score to 10-6. But the

game, the Generals failed to con-
vert on the man-up situation,
and with 27 seconds left, called
a time-out to set up one last
play.

The call went to Warfield, who
was to isolate against defense-
man John Elliott. After two
quick moves, Warfield moved in
on Matthews, who had already
made 26 saves.

The shot went for the top part
of the net. Matthews moved to
the ball, and instead of playing
it with his stick he used his
head to make the save.

The speed of the ball was
enough to knock Matthews’
helmet off, but the shot stayed
out, and after running out the
clock, the Shoremen had estab-
lished themselves as a team to
watch in the College Division
tournament, while W&L was
again in a mad scramble for one
of the final spots in Division I.

Admissions applications up,
acceptances right on target

Contrary to the nation-wide
trend among private colleges, ap-
plications for admission, as well
as confirmations from accepted
students, are up sharply this year
at Washington and Lee.

This rise comes despite in-
creased selctivity on the part of
W&L admissions officials.

The university received nearly
1,400 applications for admission
to next year’s freshman class—
four applications for every va-
cancy—representing an increase
of 12 per cent over last year’s
total. W&L seeks a freshman
class of 350 each year. To date
366 confirmations have been re-
ceived.

While no statistical analyses
have yet been prepared, the ad-
missions office estimate that the
academic quality of next year’s
freshmen will remain high. Wil-
liam A. Noell, associate admis-
sions director and coordinator of
the freshman year, reads every
application and all supporting

papers, and comments of the stu-
dents who have confirmed their
attendance next fall: “My im-
pression is that the men from
whom we have heard so far are
at least as well qualified as any
class in recent years.”

W&L held its tuition increase
to 3.8 per cent for 1975-76 over
the current year, raising it just
$100 to $2,700.
