By JOE FITZGERALD
‘The Phi News Staff

Two juniors, two sophomores,
and six freshmen announced
their candidacy for next year’s
University Council at the Ex-
ecutive Committee meeting Mon-
day night.

The rising seniors seeking seats
on the council are Keith Crocker
and Seott Stevenson. The class
is allotted three seats on that
body.

The rising juniors running for
the U.C. are Woody Woodell and
Ken Voelker. Sophomore candi-
dates include George Griffin,
Doug Jackson, John Wheatley,
David Low, Steve Marzo, and
Howard Rubel.

The elections will be held on
Monday, May 5, with run-offs
on the following Thursday if
necessary.

The candidates will be limited
to 25 posters. Upperclass candi-
dates may not put posters in the
dorms and Commons, while
freshmen are restricted to these
two locations. Candidates may
spend only $5 during the cam-
paign preceding the general
election and only $2.50 between
then and the run-off. Unlimted
spending was proposed but voted
down by the E.C.

Executive Committee Presi-
dent-elect Leland McCullough
announced plans Monday night
for a seminar the week of May 12
to discuss University-Community
or “Town-Gown” relations.

event will be W&L President
Huntley and Lexington Mayor
Charles Phillips. The speeches
will be followed by meetings of
student leaders and school ad-
ministrators with town officials,
cultural leaders, merchants and
W&L alumni from Lexington.

Possibie topics for discussion
include police activity and park-
ing regulations, the city tax, stu-
dent misconduct, check-cashing
policies and problems, benefits of
the university and the town for
each other, the financial need
of the school, ways to improve
relations between the town and
the school, and athletic events.

Thes problems will be discuss-
ed by three groups of students,
administrators and local resi-
dents, Each group will number
15 people.

In other business, the E.C.
members present at the meeting
agreed to contribute ten dollars
toward the publication of a la-
crosse yearbook to supplement
the programs now being handed
out at the games.

The members donated the
money out of their own pockets
to avoid further depleting their
beleaguered treasury.

In other business, next year’s
E.C. appointed Terry Atwood and
Clark Thompson co-chairman of
the Student Activities Board for
next year.

The meeting began with a dis-
cussion of whether a _ student
would be allowed to sit in on
the interviews of prospective
chairmen.

The new E.C. at first agreed

that it was E.C. policy to open
interviews to the student body
but to hold executive sessions
when it came time for discussion
of the applicants. Later Scott
Franklin brought up the fact
that personalities were likely to
be discussed by the applicants
and this should not be open to
the student body,

The issue was resolved for the
present when the student in ques-
tion left the meeting. The E.C.
is still not sure about the mean-
ing of an amendment that says
they can only hold executive
sessions for discussions of mat-
ters of honor. According to Bob
Pugh, the E.C. has “managed to
get around” the amendment so
far.

Also, at a meeting last week,
the new E.C. appointed Bill Kerr
head of the Voting Regulations

Board for next year and renamed
David Braun chairman of the
Recruitment Committee.

This reporter would like to
apologize to the chairman and
members of the Curriculum Com-
mittee for accidental maligning
of certain persons as a result
of a misunderstanding over Mr.
Lyles’ remarks during the April
21 Executive Commiitee meet-
ing. The story stated that “Lyles
reported that the ‘shitty re-
sponse’ as he described it was
due to members of his commit-
tee not doing their jobs as far
as collecting he form” for the
winter term curriculum survey.
But according to Lyles, only
about 100 of 1500 missing forms
could be blamed on his commit-
tee, while the rest could be traced
to “faculty confusion,” or lack
of cooperation by several faculty
members.

Liberty Hall linen to be
used in White House

“Porcelain Butterfly,” one of
three linen designs manufactur-
ed by Wamsutta Mills and de-
rived from Washington and Lee
University’s Reeves Collection of
Chinese Export porcelain, has
been selected for ceremonial use
at the White House.

The bright-blue-on-white pat-
tern was used to make table
linens for a luncheon to be given
May 5 by Mrs. Gerald R. Ford
in honor of the U.S. Senate wives.

The three porcelain-inspired
designs—“Garden” and ‘‘Medal-
lion” in addition to “Butterfly’—
are marketed by Wamsutta as
the “Liberty Hall Collection,”
taking the name of W&L’s Revo-
lutionary War-era predecessor
institution. That name was a-
dopted by trustees of the little
valley school May 13, 1776, as
an official endorsement of in-
dependence from England.

Washington and Lee receives
a royalty for its educational bud-
get from each item sold by
Wamsutta in the Liberty Hall
Collection.

Each of the designs was taken
from pieces of late 18th-century
porcelain, part of W&L’s 2,000-
piece Reeves Collection, be-
queathed to the university in 1967
by Mr. and Mrs. Euchlin D.
Reeves of Providence, R.I.

The butterfly pattern is adapt-
ed from a design on the edge of
an octagonal platter made about
1785. The plate. similar to an-
other in the Reeves Collection
that was owned by George Wash-
ington, is of the Fitzhugh de-
sign. and butterflies were used
to “turn” the corners

Wamsutta designer Peter Neal
used other details from the same

platter elsewhere in the Liberty
Hall Collection. The porcelain
Medallion pattern, as an example,
combines a scallop on the platter
with a floral design on a por-
celain service believed to have
been owned by Paul Revere and
how a part of the Reeves Col-
lection.

WeL calendar compared with
schedules at other universities

By the Phi News Staff

Next year classes begin on
September 10, and spring term
exams end on May 31. On the
proposed calendar for the com-
ing years, examinations end as
late at June 4 ‘in the proposed
calendar year for 1978-79). As
W&L men seem to spend longer
and longer periods of time on
vacation, thus lengthening the
academic year, we thought it
would be interesting to compare
calendars with several other
schools in the region.

At W&L next year, classes begin
on September 10 for the twelve-
week long Fall Term. With a
five day break for Thanksgiving.
the University closes for Christ-
mas on December 12. Classes re-
sume on January 5 for the sec-
ond twelve-week stretch, and
with a nine day break in Febru-
ary (Known as Washington Holi-
day’. exams are not finished
until April 9.

After another nine day breath-

er, the six week term begins on
April 19. And final examinations
are completed on May 31.

So for W&L. which operates
a 12-12-6 calendar, there is a
total of 46 days of vacation in-
jected into the full academic
year.

What do they do at Hollins,
which operates on a 12-4-12 sys-
tem? Like us, the women at that
institution begin classes on Sep-
tember 10. They have a nine day
Fall Break in late October, a
four day Thanksgiving Break,
and leave for Christmas on De-
cember 18.

They return on January 5 for
their four week short term. and
after a five day break in Febru-

ary, begin the second full se-
mester. A ten day vacation in
late March allows for spring

frolics in the sun. and the girls
work until May 18, the last day
of exams

Mary Baldwin Collece’s aca-
demic calendar is similar in most
respects to that of Hollins. In-
stead of a separate break in the
fall. Baldwin girls get a full
week's vacation at Thanksgiving,
and have an identical Christmas
Holiday. They also have a short
term. followed by a slight break
and then a twelve-week term in-
terrupted by a Spring Break in
late March: the college ends its

examination period on May 13.

The University of Virginia is
on a similar schedule. Classes in
Charlottesville begin on Septem-
ber 5, and with only two days off
at Thanksgiving, examinations
are dispensed with by December
19. Regular classes resume on
January 13, and with a week's
vacation in the spring. the sec-
ong term, which is one week
longer than the first, ends by
May 10.

The College of William and
Mary is planning to institute a
new academic calendar for the
coming year. While the semester
system will be retained, in a con-
densed thirteen and a half week
format, exams will be offered be-
fore Christmas and in the begin-
ning of May. Like most other
colleges. W&M will have a spring
break in mid-March.

What conclusions can be
drawn from comparing W&é&L’'s
ealendar with those of other uni-
versities and colleges? Not much
in the way of concrete compari-

sons can be drawn, but most
other campuses are operating
with a shorter academic year,

usually with twenty-four to
twenty-seven weeks of classes,
compared to thirty at W&L. Then
again, can be argued that stu-
denis at W&L are receiving more
for their dollars spent in tuition.

[REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

The proposed calendar

After seeing a copy of the tentative five-year calendar

proposed for the University (see related article, page one), we
are distressed, Next year spring term examinations end on

May 31, the following year on May 30, then on May 29, and
in 1979 on June 4.

With the increase of Washington Holiday to a full week’s
break in February, in addition to the normal Spring Break
in April, the acedemic year has become so long that in coming
years students will still be studying in the library during the
first days of June.

Admittedly, it is nice to be able to take a week’s vacation
in the doldrums of the winter months, but when such an
extension of recesses forces the encroachment of scheduled
classes into the summer months, perhaps some reconsidera-
tion should be made.

Is a full week of vacation really necessary in the middle
of the winter term? Students seem to manage without one
in the first term, Should the break be continued at its planned
length if it poses too much of a hardship on those students
who are obligated by their finances to seek summer employ-
ment? The extension of the calendar beyond Memorial Day
puts W&L students at a severe disadvantage in the summer
job market, where they must compete with students from
other schools who finish before the end of May.

We feel that the University Council and the faculty should
review its proposed calendar carefully, and consider all the
ramifications of requiring the students of W&L to remain on
campus for such a long time in the late spring because of too
much vacation in the early spring. Perhaps even a referendum
of sorts could be organized, and all students could express
their opinion in the matter by voting for or against the ex-
tended Washington Holiday,

Students and concerts

We would like to thank the members of the W&L stu-
dent body, their dates and friends, and anyone else who
attended the Four Tops concert this past Friday night—they
helped to make possible one of the more successful concerts
in several years.

The Student Activities Board has been plagued by poor
attendance at many of the concerts it has organized for the
students in Lexington over the past few years, At the an-
nouncement of each, various groups of students with musical
tastes could
be heard complaining about the lack of concerts that would

not expressly served by the given concert

satisfy their own tastes.

\nd so attendance has lagged at nearly every scheduled
concert. The SAB, in attempting to satisfy the majority of
the students, has evidently been able to appeal only to musical
minorities.

Friday night's concert appeared to show a change of heart
on both sides. SAB scheduled three bands (if the first could
be called a performing group), each of which had appeal to
different musical tastes. And the student body supported the
effort, attending in numbers sufficient enough to enable the
SAB to break even.

The relative success of the concert might encourage the
SAB to schedule more and better concerts next year. For only
with the support of most of the students can the Board
continue to attempt to bring performers of some quality to
Washington and Lee.

By DAVID URANO

Fraternities are an age-old
institution at W&L and like all
institutions, they have had their
ups and downs. Several uppers
and downers have been swallow-
ed in the past 10 years.

Ten years ago between 80 and
85 per cent of the undergraduates
were members of fraternities.
Way back then, frats were very
important to a student’s social
life. David Braun, Rush Chair-
man for the  Interfraternity
Council, said that all frat parties
were closed with the exception
of Homecoming weekend and
Springs weekend.

Fraternities adhered to string-
ent rules a decade ago. For ex-
ample, girls, women if you prefer,
were not allowed above the first
floor—probably because there
were beds on the second and
third floors. As a result, many
of the Greeks resorted to “make
out rooms,” according to Braun—
those smart fraternity men figur-
ed out that a couch was as good
as a bed.

The 15 or 20 per cent of the
students on campus who were
independents were not left off
of the couch as it were. Two
independent organizations were
formed, the Gaines Society for
the socially inclined and the
Independent Union for the
athletically inclined. The Inde-
pendent Union leaned towards
intramurals and contact sports
while the Gaines Society sponsor-
ed parties and contact sports.

Alas, social fraternities became
more liberal with open parties
and an addition to the Student
Union including the Cockpit, TV
rooms and a pinball room put a

damper on the Gaines Society's
activities. Besides, independents
were independents because they
wanted to be independent and
they didn't want organized func-
tions; so, because of a lack of
support, the Gaines Society fiz-
zeled out four or five years ago
and hasn't been heard from since.

In early 1970, the market
crashed. Delta Upsilon, Kappa
Sigma and Kappa Alpha were no
more and the percentage of
undergrads in frats fell as low
as 55 per cent,

Several houses ran into trouble,
financially and memershipwise.
In 1970, Sigma Phi Epsilon drop-
ped from 50 members to three
because the upperclassmen be-
came perturbed at the under-
classmen and, in classic W&L
form, bagged it. In the fall term
of 1973, Zeta Beta Tau was al-
most closed by the trustees be-
cause of financial difficulties.

These situations are looking up
now, however. According to Den-
nis Oakley, SPE president, there
are now 25 members in the SPE
house. Ricky Lovegrove, a ZBT
sophomore, said that his house
has 32 members now and is
breaking even financially.

Last year, five black students
organized Alpha Phi Alpha, and
nobody has heard from or about
them since. They have not been
attending IFC meetings and
therefore are not recognized as
a fraternity by the IFC, said
Dean John. According to Braun,
Alpha Phi Alpha is going to try
to rush next year.

The 1974-75 academic year is
proving to be a busy one in the
fraternity world.

In the fall term, W&L lost a

Lee attracted more than a cen-

road trips and other vitally important stuff, like drinking beer
at Goshen and trying very hard to kill yourself at Twin Falls?

(Signed) Real Slim

DEAR SLIM—The only possible solution of your problem is to
practice the fine art of brown-nosing your professor. It he's
a bachelor and under 50 ‘in mind, not body) the best thing
to do is offer to get him a date. Your grade in the course
will then be dependent on how good-looking she ‘or he) is,

and how far he got with

her (or
complimenting him on his new

ratty looking sport jackets,

and raising your hand a lot in class and hoping he doesn't
call on you. (This also helps you keep awake in class.) Staying
after class and explaining to him how you can't make out his
handwriting on the blackboard always helps to show your
serious approach to the subject.

One of the most dependable techniques to get on the good

Lacrosse Generals still hope to gain playoff slot

By BILL FLESHER

Whatever Washington and
Lee’s lacrosse Generals did to get
Lady Luck back on their side,
it happened just in the nick of
time to avert an end to any post
season hopes.

After losing three games by a
one-goal margin, including a 13-
12 sudden death setback at the
hands of North Carolina on
Wednesday, W&L turned the
tables Saturday, as freshman
midfielder Scott Baugher scored
his only goal of the game with
five seconds left to give the Gen-
erals a 15-14 win over Towson
State, the nation’s top-ranked
college division team.

Now boasting a 10-1 season
record, Washington and Lee’s
golf team will close out the sea-
son this week with home matches
against three opponents.

Coach Buck Leslie's Generals
will entertain Emory & Henry
and Madison Friday, beginning
at 1:00 p.m., and be host to
Gettysburg next Monday (May

Freshman Ray Scott recorded
four first-place finishes to lead
Washington and Lee University
to a 103-41 track victory over
Roanoke College last week, up-
ping the Generals’ season rec-
ord to 3-4.

Scott posted his best times of
the year in winning the 100-yard
dash in 9.9 and 220 in :22.6. He
also ran legs on the winning
440- and mile-relay teams.

John Tucker of Lexington ran

Over the weekend, W&L shot-

ed for Thursday at 3:00 p.m. at
Smith Field. The Generals’ rec-
ord slipped to 2-17 after a 4-2
setback at Madison last week.

After VMI, W&L’s next appear-
ance will be a double-header
Friday against Newport News
Apprentice, beginning at 1:00
p.m. on Smith Field,

The win revived the Generals’
hopes for a fourth straight trip
to the National Collegiate Athle-
tic Association (NCAA) Lacrosse
Championship Tournament,
hopes that would have been
greatly dimmed by a loss to the
Tigers,

It was a week full of thrills,
spills, and chills, but most of
all, it was a week in which two
superb lacrosse games were play-
ed. One could write on them for
several pages; we'll try to hold
it down a bit.

The week in review:

North Carolina’s 5-7 record
entering their game with W&L
was unimpressive enough to hint
an easy Generals’ win until one

looked at which teams made up
the seven.

The Tar Heels’ losses had come
at the hands of Maryland (13-9),
Princeton (12-11), Navy (11-4),
Towson State (12-7), UMBC (12-
9), Virginia (10-6), and Wash-
ington College (12-9).

After seven close losses to
teams of that caliber, it would
seem that UNC was due for a
big game, right?

So who would they happen to
have their big game against?

It’s not that the Generals
didn’t have their chances to win
the game, which lasted four reg-
ulation, two overtime, and two-
and-a-half sudden death periods
—over 78 minutes in all,

 

But it was the Tar Heels who
took advantage of that one break
to score the winning goal. Fresh-
man midfielder Paul Worstell
picked up a loose ball at mid-
field, carried the ball through
two W&L defenders, and fired a
bounce shot past goalie Malcolm
Hastings for the game-winner at
10:06 of sudden death.

The game had been a nip-and-
tuck affair throughout regula-
tion play, with neither team
holding more than a_ two-goal
lead.

The score was deadlocked at
the end of all four periods at
2-2, 5-5 at intermission, 9-9, and
11-11 after four quarters.

first goal in overtime off a Dave
Warfield feed to put W&L up
12-11. The Generals held that
lead throughout the overtime
periods until North Carolina’s
Peter Miller tallied with 1:23 left
to knot the score again.

Both teams had several op-
portunities for winning goals in
the early minutes of sudden
death, but NC goalie Chuck
Weinstein and W&L’s Hastings
came up with key saves to keep
the game going.

But then Worstell, held in
check throughout the game, came
up with the big play to hand
W&L its second sudden death loss
of the year.

All-American Bert Fett, stop-
ped cold in even-up situations by
W&L’'s Bob Lindsey, got three
extra-men goals to lead the Tar
Heels’ scoring.

Miller, Charlie Brown, Chris
Larson, and Don Carroll each
had two goals for the Generals,
while Dave Warfield added a
goal and four assists.

It was obvious what the Tow-
son State game meant to the
Generals after the North Caro-
lina loss. Another loss and the
players could count on studying
for exams rather than play in
the NCAA tournament in late
May. A win, however, would put
them back in the race.

For the Tigers, the nation’s
number one college division team,
the game provided a chance to
further solidify their hold on the
top spot, with a 15-12 win over
Virginia earlier in the week under
their belt.

And it was a grudge match
with the only team to beat the
Tigers (19-17 in overtime) in
1974.

Like the W&L-Towson games
of 1973 (‘a 13-12 General win)
and 1974, this one was another
free-wheeling, high-scoring
affair.

And, though it was midfielder
Scott Baugher who got the game-
winning goal, it was the Gen-
erals’ attack trio which made the

difference.

Senior Dave Warfield and
juniors Don Rob Morgan and
Don Carroll combined for 13
goals and nine assists. Warfield,
fully recovered from his early-
season knee injury, had seven
goals and four assists. Morgan
went four and three, Carroll,
two and two.

Meanwhile the Tigers’ attack
unit, the source of 18 points
(goals and assists) a game, was
stymied by another superb effort
by W&L defensemen Lindsey,
Tom Keigler, and John Strock.

Lindsey stopped high-scoring
attackman Wayne Eisenhut at
two goals, while the Tigers’ Bob
Griebe managed only two assists
against Keigler.

After Towson State jumped out
to a 3-1 first quarter lead, the
Generals quickly got on track
with five of the next six goals
to go ahead 6-4. But the Tigers,
who may be the most explosive
team in college lacrosse today,
duplicated the feat in the final
four minutes of the half to gain
move ahead 9-7.

The third quarter belonged to
W&L. Warfield scored goals
three, four, and five to go with
Carroll's second to boost the
Generals to an 11-10 third quart-
er lead.

But the Tigers again exploded,
this time for four of the next five
goals to regain the lead at 14-12
with 8:32 left.

Warfield then scored twice,
once on a feed from defenseman

spring of 1970. Braun said that
the KA National has granted the
11 member organization a pro-

they scrounge up four additional

the KA members are arranging
with Psi U officials to lease the
defunct Psi U’s house for next

Some other houses are becom-
ing increasingly disenchanted
with their National Fraternities
because they feel that they are
not getting enough benefits from
them, for all the money they
shovel in, to make the affilia-

that there is a resurgence in fra-
ternities because frats have fewer
reguiations governing them than
in recent memory. This year,
about 68 per cent of the fresh-
men pledged various houses and
of the undergrads, about 60 per
cent are members. Dean John
thinks that fraternity member-
ship will plateau at 60-65 per
cent of the student body. He
believes that this is an improve-
ment of 10 years ago because
freshmen will have a chance to
see and decide for themselves
which is better: fraternity life or
independent life.

Grade inflation:
is it at a standstill?

By STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

Preliminary results indicate
that the much-proclaimed phe-
nomenon of “grade inflation”
has slowed even more on the W&L
campus than the figures for fall
term indicate.

The Ring-tum Phi staff has
compiled its own departmental
grade point ratios (GPR) for
thirty-five departments and dis-
ciplines. By these compilations,
twenty departments showed gains
in their GPR, fourteen register-
ed declines, and one remained
stable.

Departments which showed
significant increases in GPR
from the winter term of 1974 to
that of 1975 were Chinese and
Russian. The GPR for Chinese
rose by .667 to 3.333. The Rus-
sion department average rose
.510 to 3.125. (These figures were
computed only from grades of
A, B, C, D, E, and F. Incom-
pletes and passing grades were
not counted.) These two disci-
plines have two of the highest
¥PR's on campus.

Those departments registering
significant declines in GPR in-
clude Spanish, dropping .483 to
2.731, Greek, down .667 to 2.923,
and courses in computer science,
which declined .458 to 2.37.
Computer science, by these un-
official figures, has one of the
lowest GPR’s in the university,
with only the English depart-
ment lowker on the scale.

Other departments which ex-
perienced increases in their GPR
were: Military science, up .273
to 3.506, the highest rating on
campus; German, up .268; pub-
lic speaking, up .130; mathe-
matics, up .147; administration,
up .173; psychology, up .160;
philosophy, up .125; accounting,
up .131; and religion, up .121.

Disciplines which registered
only modest gains of less than
.100 include drama, music, com-
parative literture, art, engineer-
ing, physics, geology, anthro-
pology, and economics.

Departments experiencing
minor declines for the winter
term include Latin, biology, his-

They've got a long way to
go. In a world that isn't easy.
But with someone's help,
they'll make it. What they need
is a friend. Someone to act as
confidant and guide. Perhaps,
it could be you as a Salesian
Priest or Brother.

The Salesians of St. John
Bosco were founded in 1859 to

 

tory, journalism, sociology and
politics. French, classics, chem-
istry, Italian, and English posted
moderate declines of between .100
and .400.

The one discipline to have a
stable GPR is Inderdepartmental,
constant at a perfect 3.0.

The ten departments or dis-
ciplines with the highest ap-
parent GPR’s are, in descending
order, military science, drama,
Chinese, public speaking, Rus-
sian, music, German, compara-
tive literature, Interdepartment-
al, and Latin. Those departments
with the lowest grades include,
from the bottom, English, com-
puter science, politics, sociology,
economics, Italian, anthropology,
geology, accounting and philoso-
phy.

Although no exact figure is
yet available for the University
as a whole, it would appear that
grade inflation has about halted,
for the declines and increases are
fairly balanced. What is notable
is that those departments on the
lower end of the scale seem to
have gone lower, while those
ranked in the upper register ap-
pear to have gone up in general.

These preliminary results fol-
low those results tabulated for
the fall term in their general
trend. Grade inflation, if there
ever really was such a thing at
W&L, has slowed to an almost
imperceptible rate. As was found
with the first term grades, how-
ever, the wide range of GPR’s
registered by various depart-
ments is startling.

Strock, to even things up at 14-
all with 4:30 to play.

Things stayed the same until
Keigler was penalized for play-
ing without a stick with 1:26 left
(the stick broke in half as Keigler
guarded Griebe).

Goalie Charlie Brown, who had
been in the cage all game as
Hastings rested a bad ankle,
stopped Griebe’s hard shot with
1:07 left, However, as Brown
cleared the ball, W&L was caught
offside, thus giving the ball back
to the Tigers.

Still a man up, Towson set up
another play, but lost the ball.
Defenseman Dave Eubank came
up with possession, and Generals’
coach Jack Emmer called time-
out to set up a final play.

Originally the play was de-
signed to let Carroll isolate on
a defenseman from behind the
goal. Instead, Carroll tried to
pass off to an open man in
front of the cage, but the pass
missed and the ball was mid-
field-bound.

After one Towson player miss-
ed the ball Baugher picked it
up, dodged one defender near the
midfield stripe, avoided another
Tiger just inside the attack box,
spun around a third Towson
man, then let loose with a bounce
shot that just stayed under the
crossbar.

As soon as the ball hit the net
the W&L bench exploded, and
for a playoff berth were very,
once again the Generals’ hopes
very real.
