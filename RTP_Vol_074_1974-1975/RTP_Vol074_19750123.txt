Fancy Dress

By Phi News Staff

Fancy Dress, Washington and
Lee’s most “elegant” tradition,
will devote its 1975 festivities to
a salute to the Swing Era. Em-
ploying the theme, ‘In the Mood,
1941,” the weekend’s activities,
which will run from Thursday,
February 20 to Sunday, Febru-
ary 23, will be highlighted by
Friday night’s 68th annual
Fancy Dress Ball, featuring the
music of the Stan Rubin Swing
Band and Dance Orchestra.

According to Student Activi-
ties Board chairman John Kill-
pack, the idea for the theme of
the Swing Era came last spring
when the current trend was a
nostalgic look back to the 30’s
and 40's. “The theme seemed to
fit well then,” stated Killpack,
“and we decided that we wanted
to go back a little more tradi-
tionally.”

The 1975 Fancy Dress activi-
ties will commence on Thursday
night, when Bill Deal and the
Rhondells will perform at Zoll-
man’s Pavillion. The time for

ODK initiations
take place on
Founders’ Day

By RYLAND OWEN

The combination Founders’
Day—Omicron Delta Kappa Con-
vocation was held last Monday
in Evans Dining Hall before an
audience of students, faculty and
alumni.

For the Founders’ Day cere-
monies President Huntley ad-
dressed the audience on the state
of the university. According to
Huntley, there are those who feel
the university dwells too much
on the past while others feel
there is too much emphasis on
the future; in response to these
ideas Huntley maintained,
“Washington and Lee stands at
a proper balance between past
and future.”

(Continued on page 4)

the party will be announced at
a later date and the admission
price will be included in the total
cost of Fancy Dress.

The highlight of Fancy Dress
weekend wlil, of course, be the
Fancy Dress Ball, which will be
held on Friday night at 8:30 in
the Early Fielding Student Cen-
ter, as well as Evans Dining Hall.
“What we're basically attempting
to do,” explained Killpack, “is
to recreate a 40’s nightclub, The
Starlight Club.” The ball will
include many different activities
ranging from a comedian in the
cockpit to the Stan Rubin Or-
chestra.

The Rubin band, which will
perform in the dining hall, fea-
tures not only the hits of the
swing era, but will also include
many popular hits of today. In
addition, Rubin will feature a
five piece Dixieland band which
will play the original Dixieland
jazz. The 13 piece Rubin Swing
Band and Dance Orchestra is
appearing for the fourth time at
a W&L Fancy Dress. The New
York band has previously appear-
ed in 1963, 1964, and 1965.

In the Cockpit, New York
comedian Kenny Kramer will
entertain guests, while other
activities around the Student
Center will include movies, a
small student combo, and more
entertainment soon to be an-
nounced. The ball will end at
1:00 a.m. and liquid beverages
will be included in the admission
price.

In addition, the SAB has an-
nounced that the entire Student
Center will be wallpapered blue,
and the ceilings will all be lined
with tiny white lights, which will
supply the only lighting. Furth-
ermore, the decorations will in-
clude potted palm trees and other
items that will add to the mood
of the swing era.

The weekend's other activi-
ties will consist of a grain party,
sponsored by the freshman class,
on Saturday afternoon at Zoll-
man’s Pavillion. Also, many fra-
ternities will be holding combo
parties, most likely opened to all

‘Critical Decisions Facing America’

By STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

“Contact,” the annual sym-
posium designed to expose stu-
dents to issues of current signi-
ficance, will be sporting a few
changes this winter.

More emphasis will be placed
upon the original goal of pro-
viding a series of lectures that

$1.5 million donation received;
science hall named for Parmly

A $1.5-million gift to the en-
dowment of W&L has been made
by Miss Ruth Parmly of New
York City in honor of her father,
the late Charles Howard Parmly.

In recognition of the gift, the
university has named its engi-
neering, physics and biology
building, until now simply known
as the “New Science Building,”
Parmly Hall. A formal dedication
will be held later in the year.

The announcement was made
Monday by President Huntley at
a convocation marking Founders’
Day, Robert E. Lee's birthday,

and Omicron Delta Kappa intia-
tion.

The income from Miss Parmiy's
gift will be used to support
W&L's academic program in the
field of science and to continue
strengthening faculty salaries in
those departments.

Miss Parmly’s generous gift to
W&L is one of the largest in its
history, and brings to $27.2-mil-
lion the amount raised to date in
its development program for the
decade of the 1970s. That total
represents 75% of a $36-million
initial goal for 1976.

Professor Parmly taught phys-
ics and engineering at the Col-
lege of the City of New York
from 1888, the year of his gradu-
ation from that institution, un-
til his death in 1917 at the age
of 48.

He was the founder of CCNY's
engineering school, having spent
several years planning it in de-
tail. The CCNY board of trustees
approved his proposal and named
him its first professor and chair-
man only four months before his
death.

Though he spent his entire
professional career at City Col-
lege, Prof. Parmly was, in Hunt-
ley's phrase, “manifestly the kind
of man who today gives this uni-
versity its enduring strength
an extraordinarily effective
teacher of undergraduates.

“There can be no more fitting
tribute to Charles Howard
Parmly and to the standard of
education his life reflected— and
which we seek also to reflect
than the dedication of our engi-
neering, physics and biology
building to his memory

In addition to the announce-
ment of Miss Parmly's gift by
President Huntley at the Found-
ers’ day ceremonies here, a
special announcement of the gift
was made to the “Achievement
Council the volunteer leader-
ship organization which has re-

supplement the classroom. While
not critical of their predeces-
sors’ performance, the current
co-chairmen, Ben Sherman and
Bob Wyckoff, feel that “Contact”
has become too entertainment-
oriented in recent years and not
very substantive.

It is hoped that this year's
theme, “Critical Decisions Pac-
ing America,” will bring the
symposium back toward its goal,
as stated in the Student Hand-
book, of “offering the interested
student ‘contact’ with ideas and
issues that are of contemporary
interest, educational in nature,
and beyond the normal scope of
any department or course offered
by the University.”

The topic chosen was derived
from the name of the commis-
sion Vice President Nelson Rocke-
feller established upon resigning
as governor of New York. “It
seemed appropriate, said Sher-
man, “as the United States ap-
proaches its bicentennial, for
“Contact” to use such a theme,
dealing as it does with problems
of growing intensity.” These
problem areas include govern-
ment, economy, the legal sys-
tem, environment, and credibility
of the press.

The speakers who are sched-
uled to appear on campus be-
tween Feb. 25 and March 10 in-
clude; William Rukeyser, mod-
erator of “Wall Street Week"
on the National Educational
Television Network and author
of “How to Get Rich on
Wall Street”; William H. Rehn-
quist, Associate Justice of the
US Supreme Court; David
Brower, past president of the
Sierra Club and founder of the

speaker had cancelled his engage-
ment. No one who had previosuly
said he would come has can-
celled; however, Dr. Daniel Boor-
stin and Rogers C. B. Morton,
who were tentatively scheduled
to appear, have had to abandon
their plans to attend. The Uni-
versity’s semi-annual calendar of
events lists the two gentlemen as
definitely coming to Lexington,
however, and so the rumor was
started.

The committee members are
still working feverishly to sched-
ule a debate between Brower and
an as-yet-unnamed spokesman
for the public utilities. A debate
would provide an unusual op-
portunity for students to hear
both sides of the “environment
versus industry” argument ad-
dressed.

Sherman and Wyckoff hope to
provide extra opportunities for
small group discussions with
other speakers. For example,
Rukeyser would attend an open
Commerce Fraternity meeting,
Justice Rehnquist would meet
with the Tucker Law Forum, and
Brower could speak to the Out-

ing Club. These and other in-
formal discussions will be held
if schedules permit, and would
be in addition to the traditional
Bookstore appearances, fratern-
ity cocktail parties, and post-lec-
ture receptions.

Another project that was initi-
ated this year was the ex-
hibit in the Student Center dur-
ing Parents’ Weekend. This dis-
play was shown in the hopes
of stirring interest and support
for the program among parents.

A less important change for
the coming lectures will be more
variety among the students who
introduce guest lecturers. In the
past it has been customary for
the co-chairmen to deliver the
opening remarks each evening;
this year other members of
“Contact” will be given a chance
to ascend the rostrum.

As it now stands, “Contact has
slightly over $8800 with which to
work, Of this, $3000 came from
the Interfraternity Council,
$4800 from the Student Execu-
tive Committee, and $1000 in
contributions from parents and

RE SESE ae

|REVIEW and OUTLOOK
The Automatic Rule

The Automatic Rule has been in effect at least since the
1930's but that is not really a good reason for keeping it now.
The goals of the Rule are understandable but the means em-
ployed toward its ends could stand some reevaluation. Ac-
cording to the Catalogue of Washington and Lee, the Rule
is designed to insure that the student will make the expected,
minimal progress toward attaining a degree within the pre-
scribed time. All it really does is weed out those students who
cannot meet its yearly grade average requirements—in many
cases, perhaps prematurely,

 

A freshman is expected to have a grade point average of
1.5 at the end of his first academic year. However, the student
must only achieve a 1.9 on all work attempted to graduate.
A freshman who falls under the Automatic Rule at the end
of the academic year is denied the chance to bring his average
up to an acceptable level, unless an exception is made, It
appears that the Automatic Rule says that such progress can-
not be made when it seems well within the realm of possibility.

We do not mean to suggest that all requirements for
graduation be dropped but we do feel that the rule that each
student realize at least a specific grade average at the end
of each academic year should be reconsidered, It seems a bit
too harsh and too “automatic.”

In place of an Automatic Rule we would suggest a more
lenient system. Perhaps a student could be asked to leave after
three 12-week terms on academic probation rather two as is
now the case. The largest group of students falling under the
Automatic Rule is from the freshman class and we feel that
freshmen need at least a second chance after their first year
away at college.

Washington and Lee should remember that its responsibility
should be to do everything in its power to keep its students
here without lowering its own standards significantly. We feel
that there must be a happier medium between the school’s
responsibility to its students and to its standards than the
Automatic Rule,

Get Ready

The plans of the Student Activities Board for Fancy Dress
Weekend, which are described on page one, promise one of
the biggest and best celebrations in the history of that event.
The SAB has worked long and strenuously to make this year’s
Fancy Dress more than just a revival of a traditional winter
weekend, Its ambitious plans should provide a spectacle which
rivals, if not surpasses, the splendor which made Fancy Dress
at Washington and Lee the social event of the east coast in
its heyday. We wish to remind the student body that Fancy
Dress is coming and is only weeks away. Get ready!

Editor's Note: The article which
follows is reprinted from Volume
LXVII, Number 40, appearing on
March 19, 1968. It was one in a
series of articles printed in the
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi on the
newspaper's history and one we
feel worthy reprinting. The
writer was Reeve W. Kelsey.

“Educationally your Alma Mater

“Educational your Alma Mater
seems on the eve of a great de-
velopment. The air of the campus
is vibrant with optimism and
enthusiasm. Overflowing num-
bers, entire harmony, athletic
success, freedom from misbe-
havior and disorder and college
spirit—all these combine to make
from the educational standpoint
a happy present and a bright
future,”

Thus wrote Henry Louis Smith,
W&L’s seemingly eccentric presi-
dent of the “Twenties,” on Page
Three of the January 13th, 1920,
Alumni Edition of the Ring-tum
Phi. As a matter of fact, Smith’s
incessant writing of letters to
be published in the Ring-tum
Phi appears to today’s reader to
be quaint and amusing.

Impoverished Condition

Smith moved on and outlined
the impoverished condition of the
University’s finances: “Its tiny
endowment equals only $1,500 per
student, instead of the $6,400
which is now the average of
colleges of its type... Financi-
ally she is facing dire emergency.”

Smith finished his message
with a plea to the alumni: “The

Alumni of Harvard, Yale, Prince-
ton, Dartmouth, Cornell, Leland
Stanford are all rallying to their
imperiled institutions with a
magnificent zeal, a unanimous
self-sacrifice, a record-breaking
liberality.”

“Let the Alumni of our historic
institution see to it that in this
unexampled financial emergency
their Alma Mater shall not be
crippled in her great work for
the lack of adequated financial
support, that her energies shall
be released to answer the call of
her great opportunity, and that

even more in the future than in
the past she shall be the South’s
most fruitful nursery of America’s
leadership.”

The more things change, the
more they stay the same...

The newspaper also reported
that Rupert N. Latture had re-
ceived “the Croix du Guerre for
calmness and devotion to duty”
while serving in France during
the first World War. A list of
those honor roll students was
published, and among those on
the list was the name of Fitz-
gerald Flournoy.

The Ring-tum Phi's greatest
crusade of the year was to resur-
rect the Southern Collegian. The
January 27 editorial said, “If the
typical old Southern Collegian is
a bit too heavy for the campus
of today to absorb, then replace
it by a magazine modeled on
Life.’ The editorial exhorted the
EC to pass the necessary legisla-
tion.

The battle continued when the
EC passed the following resolu-
tion: “Resolved: That the Editor
of the Ring-tum Phi is hereby

DEAR TRAVELLER—What is “the top” at Washington and Lee,

and how does one get there?

(Signed) Murph

DEAR MURPH—I presume you're either referring to the honor
organizations or else to the more exclusive group of those stu-
dents who have taken five physical education courses without
getting Coach Lord for at least one of them. I will assume the

former.

There are a number of organizations on campus which are
considered to be “the top.” These include “Who's Who,” “ODK,”

and “Friends of the EC.” Being a member of the last of

is a prerequisite to getting into the other two. Z
How does one get there? A tough question. To reach

it takes intelligence, charm, reliability, hard work, and a

wit, That leaves out the C-school. Five-dollar bills slipped quietly

 
  

under the door of those who select the membership don’t hurt,

either.

An easy way to get elected into these elite organizations is to
attain an office of high visibility within any of the various stu-
dent organizations. You can run unopposed for the EC, for
example, or you can vote for those running unopposed for the
EC and then have them appoint you to a student organization.

Once you are elected or appointed, your troubles are over.
Don't worry about doing anything. That's about the last thing

on the list of prerequisites for

these honor organizations. The

important thing is that you are in these posts, whether you do
anything or not, It's reported that both ODK and Who's Who
waned to induct Elmer Klassen, but the forms they mailed him

never got there.

What positions are shoe-ins for these organizations? Anything
on the EC. No matter what, you'll get in these organizations
eventually. If you can't get elected, get appointed. The Student
Activities Board is a start. Editor of the Phi usually doesn’t hurt,
although your chances here decline as your number of editorials

against the EC increase.

The important thing to remember is that it's not what you
do; it’s who you know, Remember, it’s not “Who's He?” or “(O)h,

(D)on't (K) now.”

DEAR TRAVELLER—What ever happened to streaking?

(Signed) H. Hefner

DEAR H.—Ah, fear not, it has yet to disappear from the W&L
campus. The C-School fraternity is planning a mass streak
around Dean Varner's desk sometime soon—whenever they can
figure out how to streak without taking off their khakis and

topsiders.

DEAR TRAVELLER—What ever

(Signed) The Board of Trustees

DEAR BOARD—Ah, fear not, it has yet to disappear from the W&L
campus. The EC is planning a mass co-education referendum
with polling places in the Co-op, the footbridge, and the corner
of Nelson and Main—whenever they can figure out that this

really is an all-male school.

restaurant in the near future.

But this article isn’t about Mrs.
Odell’s new resturant; rather it
is about the place it superceded:
the Picking Parlor.

It was a place without restric-
tions, it seemed, or maybe they
just never had any trouble with
the people who came in. The
farmers never seemed to mind the
students, and the townies and the
professors got along fine. And
more often than not, these people
mixed together at the same table,
bought each other beer, and
clapped and hollered to the music
together.

You weren't suppose to bring
beer in the Parlor, but buy it
there because they needed the
money. The Parlor had so little
money that they couldn’t pay
the musicians that came in to
play for the crowd. But the
musicians always came anyway,
as if they didn’t care about be-
ing paid. And someone always
took the time to move around
between the tables, squeezing be-
tween shoulders and backs, to
pass the hat.

If you were going to the parlor
for the second time you were
bound to see some familiar faces,
because there were a whole two
tables full of guys and gals that
were there every week. I remeber
once hearing these words when

a “regular” had failed to show
up last week:

“Where the heck were you last
week, Joe? We thought you were
dead or something.

“Why I was right here listen-
ing to every chord—what are you
talking about?

“If you were here last week
then J’m not sitting before your
eyes right now.”

“Well, if you ain't here, then
what you hollering at me for
skipping last week for?”

Somehow, as if some invisible
being was moving about quieting
everybody down, a hush would
settle in when the band was
ready to play. Once things were
quiet, Freddy would tighten a
few more ivory keys, reaching up
his banjo, or David would give

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor of the Phi:

I am writing this letter to
compliment you on your out-
standing editorial in last week's
issue of the Ring-tum Phi. You
have done a great service to the
entire W&L community in shed-
ding some light upon the grossly
irresponsible and illogical con-
duct of the S.A.B.U. and SAB.
members involved in the maniacal
negotiations for Black Awareness
Week. The very idea of using
funds from the Student Body
tax to support an activity which
eaters to a minority interest
group is enough to make me
retch!

It seems to me that this entire
affair has been characterized by
blatant discrimination against
every other minority interest
group on campus, be it racial,
political, religious, or whatever.
The S.AB. is entirely obligated
to co-sponsor the next function
of the W&L College Republicans,
the Young Democrats, the Saz-
eracs, etc,

This, of course leads us to the
controversy that evolved when
S.A.B.U. demanded Student Body
tax funds for the recruitment of
more Black students; how ab-

what is? How many of you are
aware of the fact that a certain
percentage of the profits from
the sale of Law textbooks to
white law students are used to
provide FREE text books for the

Clearly some drastic changes
are in order; it is my sincere

good sense to put an end to this

Wé€eL’s Hudson moves to top

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

The accomplishments of fresh-
man swimmer John Hudson have
gone largely unnoticed outside of
these pages and the new pool in
Doremus Gym.

And it’s quite unfortunate, as
Hudson may be on his way to
achieving something no W&L
swimmer has ever done—win-
ning a national championship.

Through Sunday, the freshman
from Lancaster, Pa. had the top
times in the NCAA's Division III
in the 500- and 1000-yard free-
styles. In addition, Hudson was
in the top ten in the 200-yard
freestyle.

“He’s just a phenomenal swim-
mer,” said W&L swimming coach
Bill Stearns of Hudson. “He
works his tail off every day, and
obviously it’s paying off for him.”

Hudson has recorded times of
1:48.4 in the 200, 4:46.7 in the

500, and 9:55 in the 1000, all
school records. In practice, he
has bettered his time in the 1000
by seven seconds. His times in
the 500 and 1000 are also state
records.

Hudson has qualified for the
NCAA Division III championship
meet in all three events. He will
also team up with sophomore
Tad Van Leer and juniors Bill
Tiers and Rob Searles in the 800-
yard freestyle relay.

Van Leer has qualified in the
50-yard freestyle.

“We expect the Division III
meet to be tough, because a lot
of the California schools who
have good swimming teams have
gone Division III,” Stearns said.

The Division III meet will be
held March 20-22 in Meadville,
Pa., at Alleghany College.

Richmond tankmen top W&L

Freshman swimming sensation
John Hudson stole the show, but
Richmond's Spiders made off
with a 61-52 dual meet win
Saturday afternoon in W&L’'s
new pool.

Hudson, from Lancaster, Pa.,
broke the school, pool, and state
records in the 500-yard freestyle
with a 4:46.75 clocking. Hudson's
time was also the fastest record-
ed by a Division-III swimmer
this year.

Earlier in the season Hudson
had become number one nation-
ally in Division-III with a 9:48
clocking in the 1000-yard free-
style.

Hudson's accomplishment in
the 500-free Saturday was ac-
cented by the fact that he had
earlier won the 1000- and 200-
yard freestyles in back-to-back
order.

Sophomore Tad Van Leer add-
ed a double win for the Generals
in the 50- and 100-yard free-
styles.

Other W&L wins came from

Rod Scott in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley, and from the
400-yard freestyle relay.

Richmond made its biggest
gains with 1-2 finishes in both
diving events and the 200-yard
butterfly.

The loss dropped W&L to 5-2,
while Richmond evened its rec-
ord at 3-3.

W&L is on the road this week-
end, with meets at Loyola of
Baltimore Friday and at Gettys-
burg College Saturday.

not because of the fracture in his
elbow which sidelined him for
six weeks.

The 6'6” junior forward, who
averaged 14.5 points in the two
games he played in before being
injured, was set to return to
action this week until a doctor
told him he had contracted mon-
onucleosis.

Fitzgerald was told that he

Through games of January 11,
the Generals ranked sixth de-
fensively in Division III with a
56.9 defensive points per game
average.

The University of Chicago top-
ped the list with a 48.8 defensive
average.

It should be noted that none
of the five teams ranked ahead
of W&L approached the Generals’
win-loss record of 9-2. Of course,
it’s now 11-2, and again, none
of the leaders come close.

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball Generals rode their best
shooting game of the season to
an easy 98-67 win over Hamp-
den-Sydney Saturday afternoon
in a Virginia Collegiate Athletic
Association game in Doremus
Gym.

W&L, now 11-2 on the year, hit
58.3% of their shots from the
field, marking their best effort
from the floor since the Lebanon
Valley game of 1974, when the
Generals connected on over 60%
of their shots.

Junior guard John Podgajny
led the scoring parade for W&L
with 22 points, all from the field.
Podgajny hit his first five shots,
and went on to miss only six of
17 attempts on the afternoon.

Center Norm Kristoff added
another strong performance with
18 points, 12 rebounds and four
blocked shots, while 6’9” sopho-
more Don Berlin came off the
bench to score 12 points.

All 11 Generals who played hit
the scoring column.

Dick Ponti led the Tigers with
19. points.

Generals Coach Verne Canfield
said despite the fact that Hamp-
den-Sydney scored over what
W&L opponents have been aver-
aging, his Generals had another
good defensive game.

“People forget that many of
our points were set up by steals,
forced turnovers, and things like
that,” Canfield said. ‘“‘We had to
play some good defense to get
those, that’s for sure.”

W&L led for all but two
minutes in posting their second
straight win. The Generals took
the lead for good at 4-2, then

steadily increased that margin

W&L put the Tigers away with
a 14-2 spurt that opened the sec-

manage only one field goal in the
first 5:45 of the second half,
and by then, W&L was long gone.

Wrestlers triumph
at Davidson, 29-13

By LEE KECK
Phi Sports Writer

Sparked by victories in the last
five weight classes, Washington
and Lee's wrestlers grabbed their
fifth win against one loss, 29-13,
last Friday night in a dual meet
at Davidson.

Howard Knipp (118), co-cap-
tain Don Overdorff (126), Jim
Crytzer (158), Ray Smith (167),
co-captain Doug Ford (177), Bill
Cole (190), and Steve Schweiz-
erhof (Hwy.) all posted individ-
ual victories over the wildcats.

Coach Gary Franke cited sev-
eral good matches responsible
for the victory, “especially Over-
dorff’s one point (7-6) victory
which probably turned the meet
around in our favor and Ray

Smith's win in his first varsity
start of the season.”

Knipp, Crytzer, and Ford join-
ed Smith in the ranks of the un-
beaten, extending their records
to 6-0-0. Winning by pins for
the Generals were Ford and Cole.
Davidson forfeited the Heavy-
weight division.

Davidson managed only one
pin (126) all night. The rest of
their points came from a super-
ior decision at 142 and a victory
at 150.

W&L hosted Eastern Menno-
nite Tuesday and hosts Pembroke
College, VPI, and Western Caro-
lina in a quadrangular meet
Saturday at noon.

On Wednesday, the VMI Key-
dets travel to Doremus Gym for
a dual meet starting at 7:30 p.m.

Concerns of W&L
in the roaring '20’s
(Continued from Page 2)
advised that the Student Body
Executive Committee of Wash-~-
ington and Lee University has
no jurisdiction to voluntarily in-
stall any publication in the Uni-
versity as per the editorial ap-
pearing in the Ring-tum Phi on

March 9th.”

The world moved on .. . the
Department of Accounting was
created in the Commerce School.
The McCormicks gave the school
$200,000. The history department
announced a new course, “The
History of the World War.” Fin-
ally, as usual, the editor of the
Ring-tum Phi had his way and
the Southren Collegian was
scheduled to start the next year.
In a student-wide election Fitz-
gerald Flournoy defeated J. W.
Bower, 258-234, to become the
editor of the new magazine.

No Intoxicating Liquors

In one of the most surprising
moves of the year the junior
class and the 13 Club passed the
following resolution: “We, the
members of the Junior Class and
the 13 Club, pledge ourselves as
gentlemen that we will not take
a drink of any intoxicating
liquors five hours before the
spring dances or at any dance.”!!

The ubiquitous Ring-tum Phi
editor glowed, “It is sincerely
hoped that this will solve the
problem for all time of sober
dances at W&L—a _ condition
which certainly was not the case
at our last dance at least.”

On the fraternity scene the
chapters of Zeta Beta Tau and
Pi Kappa were formed; the
Troubs put on a Vaudeville pro-
duction; and the baseball team
challenged the likes of Amherst,
the University of Georgia, Au-
burn, the Naval Academy, and
West Point.

Thus closed the first school
year in the 1920’s. The battle
over The Collegian and the des-
perate need for Alumni support—
who would know it was 1920
instead of today?

EC holds town forums
on WéeL’s honor code

By JOE FITZGERALD

The Executive Committee is
holding open meeting in Lee
Chapel this week in hopes of
eliciting student opinion and
debate concerning the possible
need for revision of the honor
system. The meetings, scheduled
for Wednesday and Thursday at
7 p.m., will be chaired by E.C.
president Ben Bailey.

Although the E.C. members

will be present during most of
the discussion, they will “stay
out of it as long as possible”
according to Bailey. If discus-
sion is not spontaneous, Bailey
may attempt to stimulate debate
by reading comments from the
survey sheets circulated by the
E.C. this month.

The E.C. will review those
sheets at their meeting next Mon-
day, and hold further open meet-
ings next week if they are needed.

O.D.K. initiates 20 new members

(Continued from page 1)

The financial situation of the
university was also discussed,
with emphasis being placed on
the need for further contribu-
tions in order to keep up with
rising costs brought on by infla-
tion. Huntley pointed out tuition
would continue to rise unless the
amount of money received from
alumni and friends of the uni-
versity continues to increase.

Although W&L, like all other
private schools, has been affected
by inflation, Huntley concluded
that “few schools can find more
cause for optimism.”

interested alumni. Members of
“Contact” are trying to raise
additional funds, as each speaker
costs $1500-$1750, not including
programs, mailings and posters.
Sherman said that each year
about $1500 is customarily left
behind for the following year’s
symposium, and that this year’s
group would like to continue the
tradition.

A remembrance of the Pickin’ Parlor

(Continued from page 2)

that first bass fiddle chord an
insurance pluck. Just when the
audience was more than ready,
the musicians were about ready.
Danny Hull takes a couple of
picks at his dobro. Someone yells
“g5 0.” Freddy i tighten
another string. The musicians
are just about ready. The audi-
ence is too ready. Freddy gives
an eye check with Guy. Guy
puts his bow on the opening
string. The audience has been
hearing the music for the last
minute. Silence.

A long whine pierces the air,
followed by a shorter one, then
a longer one, then a faster one,
then an even faster one, as Guy
pumps faster and faster on his
fiddle, holding the piece of wood
tight with his chin and shoulder.
The tight-skin plucking of Fred-
dy’s banjo jumps in and biends
with the motion and the music.
Nodding turns into clapping, and
clapping evoles into stomping,
as Danny’s dobro becomes part
of the moving sound. Then every
few seconds you can hear clearly
deep voice of David’s bass fiddle
tying down the rising tempo to
a solid beat. The fierce fiddling,

the solid clapping, the terse
plucking, the shoe stomping—it
get louder, then louder, then, it
seems, even louder, and faces
take on an unbelieving grin that
it just couldn’t get any louder.
The Picking Parlor was many
things to many different people
in and around Lexington. What
those things were or who those

people might be really doesn’t
matter now, because the Appa-
lachian Picking Parlor has been
sold. But I tell you all this be-
cause chances are, if you’re in
Lexington long enough, you
might hear one of the regulars,
or even someone who went only
occasionally, say “You know,
that was a good place.”

More General news

(Continued from Page 3)

Not counting the season open-
ing Tip-Off Tournament, in
which he played sparingly, junior
center Norm Kristoff has been
in double figures in all but one
game. Only Navy kept Kristoff
below 10 points, and, even then,
points weren’t needed by W&L
in the Generals’ best defensive
effort of the year... Kristoff is
currently the Generals’ leading
scorer with an 11.6 average, fol-
lowed by John Podgajny with
11.3 and Greg Croghan with a
10.2 average... W&L is outscor-
ing their opponents by an aver-
age of 12 points per game.

In case you’re heading down
Roanoke way for this Saturday’s

Go south on I-81 until you
reach the first Salem exit. Get
off I-81, then take a right at
the end of the ramp on State
Rt. 419. Proceed on Rt. 419 until
you reach the third traffic light,

right on Electric, and proceed
until the Center appears one
traffic light down.

Remember, the game is at the
Salem Civic Center. If you go to
the larger, newer Roanoke Civic
Center, which is in downtown
Roanoke, you'll end up seeing
the circus. Take that as you will.
