EC approves donations

suggests honor change

ty JOE FITZGERALD
The Phi News Staff

The Executive Committe end-
ed the year Monday night by
giving away upwards of $200
and passing two definitve and
non-binding recommendations.

The E.C. gave Harry Lee Row-
ing Club $200 to cover the cost
of a few thousand dollars worth
of rowing equipment, plus vari-

ous debts incurred by the club
over the year.
The E.C. normally will give

$100 to a new group on campus
at the beginning of the year and
then leave them on their own.
This custom was waived because
of the expense of rowing equip-
ment and the initiative shown
by the club during the year.

The E.C. also agreed to give
WLUR-FM any money they need

over what is gathered in other
places to cover the cost of broad-
casting yesterday's lacrosse game
against John Hopkins. The
Station has already gathered
enough money to pay for a low-
noise phone line to air the game.
but wanted the E.C. promise as
security against Ma Bell's de-
mands should the game go into
extensive overtime.

The E.C. closed
visions of the honor system by
voting to include the following
standard pledge in the White
Book and to recommend it to
faculty so that they may recom-

out ther re-

mend it to their students: “On
my honor, I have neither given
nor received any unacknowledged

The E.C. also voted, with
Steve Robinson abstaining, to
recommend that Steve Robinson
shave off his Fu Manchu
mustache.

Hot Damn...

Bring on Maryland...

Those were the feelings of
about two hundred hot, tired but
excited fans on Wednesday eve-
ning at Homewood Field in
Baltimore, Maryland. The 90 de-
gree sun ead made it plain to
the Capital of Lacrosse that the
bids were properly given but just
not in the right order.

On Sunday afternoon the Lex-
ington community learned that
its Lacrosse team had received a
bid to the University Division
NCAA Lacrosse Finals. And that
team from Charlottesville had
not. People who follow lacrosse
took this with some surprise.
Hopkins took it as relief. They
thought their real test would
come from state rival Maryland.
The Jays would blow the Gen-
erals back to Lexington.

But Coach Jack Emmer had
his own ideas; he said, “We
would rather play Johns Hopkins
in the first round of the finals
in Baltimore than any other
team.” Emmer’s reasoning was
based on two points. Washing-
ton and Lee had lost in last

year’s quarter finals to the same
Hopkins team, 11 to 10. W&L
would be up for the re-match.
Secondly, the Generals are a
defensive team. They can handle
any offense used by their op-
ponents. Hopkins was labeled the
strongest shooter in lacrosse.

To counter the two best guns
for Hopkins, Mike O'Neill and
Franz Wittlesberger, Emmer
pulled a surprise. W&L placed
a defenseman who has only play-
ed 16 lacrosse games in his life,

Curly Culp, to manhandle the
junior Wittlesberger. Wittles-
berger had five goals but was
unable to lead his squad and
shot widely another 20 times.

vob Morgan checked O'Neill for
no goals and many bruises.
Lastly the play of Charlie Brown
was superb. Brown stopped 18
shots and most came with a re-
tiring sun in his face.

What will long be remembered
about Brown’s day was not his
defense but the freshman’s of-

fense from the goal. In the sec-
ond period, with Hopkins a man
down, Brown cannoned a 75 yard
shot over the heads of the un-
usually-placed backline for the
Blue Jays. That score coming
in the second quarter capped the
best team-manship performance
from Don Carroll, Rob Morgan
and Dave Warfield to date.
Totally the three scored 8 times.
Of the 11 goals scored for the
Generals, 8 were assisted.
Carroll shot the opening score
in the first minute and a half.
He took the ball around the left-
side of the crease and hit. The
Generals were overwhelmed at
the ease in which Carroll beat
his man. After Hopkins took the
following face-off W&L inter-
cepted a cross-the-crease pass
and started a fast break. With
four quick passes, the last be-
ing a Morgan to Warfield to
goal movement, W&L was ahead
2 to 0. The third goal for the

Interpretation of Shakespeare questioned

BARNEY SKELTON
George Bernard Shaw once
said that he would rather read
The Tempest than see it per-
formed on stage. He held this
opinion because he felt that the
imagery of the play was too
ethereal and fantastic to allow
for a convincing physical repre-
sentation. In short, he asserts
that Shakespeare's verse in The
Tempest virtually transcends its
medium of drama. Furthermore,
he implies that attempts to do
justice to the play will, at best,
fall short of what, in a reading,
is evoked in a mind's eyes, and

Ls

at worst may seem potentially
absurd.
Personally. I do not fully con-

cur with Shaw The play is cer-
tainly stageable, but it is ex-
tremely difficult to produce. As
a director. one must handle The
Tempest with kid gloves; heavy-
handed interpretations usually
result in failure, for the sym-
metry of the play is as delicate
as it is complex

Applying these thoughts to the
University Theatre's production
I can only conclude that director
Al Gordon was interested least
of all in symmetry. With the
exception of one scene, I am
convinced that I viewed an ex-
rendition of The Temp-

I will concede that the scene

of this scene. He must have de-

OUTLOOK and REVIEW}

To graduating seniors...

For many students, this is their last full week on campus.
Next Thursday 365 seniors will formally complete their
education, as they receive their diplomas from President
Huntley and flip their tassels to the left.

Four years of life in Lexington, a life full of difficult

   

studies, of nights spent going down the road, of times both
good and bad; four very long and yet very short years will
come to an end for you, the Class of 1975, You will be leaving
this sleepy little town and embarking on a new voyage in
your lives, and doing so at a time when conditions are poor
economically, socially and politically.

We feel confident that you who are about to leave here
will come to grips with any problems that may loom ahead
and will overcome them handily. Washington and Lee hope-
fully has taught you how to cope with more than just term
papers and lab practicals. Your time spent in Lexington has
presumably benefited you in many ways, aiding you in your
mental, physical and spiritual development. All those history
mid-terms, Red Square parties, late-night bull sessions, road
trips, cramming for exams, Truck-Stop runs, and afternoons
at Wilson Field have had their effects on each of you, and
hopefully you are better men for it.

We hope that you graduates-to-be are leaving W&L with
a deep appreciation for the school and for what it has done for

careers, whether they entail further education or a foray into
the business world. To the Class of ’75 we say, “Thank you
for what you have contributed to Washington and Lee during
your stay here.”

—S.C.Y.

.. And to the freshmen

Most freshmen entering college have some apprehensions
about the experience of which they are about to partake.
These considerations may not keep them awake at night but
they are nonetheless real. Most will wonder about this new
life style and about the quality of life at Washington and Lee.

These misgivings are indeed well founded; adapting to
college life is not easy. W&L will expect a great deal from
you, as it does from each member of the student body. The
school will challenge you in every sense, especially academic-
ally and socially. Washington and Lee is here not only to
serve but to be served by those who matriculate.

The success of your first year here is largely dependent
on you. The school provides only the environment and op-
portunity for intellectual and personal growth. It is left to
the individual to meet the challenge which awaits him, One
can only gain by responding to the opportunity provided by
this institution. Freshmen learn that the old maxim still rings
true: you have to put something into it before you can get
anything out of it.

W&L will require your best. This is something we hope
you will assume rather than having to learn from your own
experience. Through dedication to the betterment of both
yourself and the school your stay here will be all it can and
should be.

The only advice that we can offer which will specifically
serve you in your first year here is that you should keep an
open mind to all the new experiences and alternatives with
which you will soon be faced. Do not allow yourself to close
the door to different facets of life at W&L before you have
learned to appreciate that which they have to offer.

While going through freshman orientation make a point
of listening to all those who would advise you. Everybody is
willing to give advice to freshmen, Each person's point of
view will prove helpful if you can possibly absorb it all, As
people tell you about the Honor System or their concept of
the school, listen carefully and learn from them before you
have to learn it on your own,

One important aspect of life at W&L is the fraternity sys-
them, Fraternities were weakened in the sixties, but have
made a strong comeback and are prospering. Today, well over
half of the students are affiliated with Greek houses. Many
people feel that ther fraternity membership has played an
important role in_ their Whatever
prejudices may be, one should go through Rush and attempt

college career. one’s
to gain an understanding of the system here before making
a commitment.

Come to W&L with an open mind and make a point of
listening to other people when you get here, If you do this
vou will be able to enjoy a successful and rewarding first
vear in college. This school has so much to offer that your
tay at W&L will prove a happy one if you only let it,

We look forward to seeing you this fall and sincerely hope
that both you and Washington and Lee profit by your com-
ing Good luck!

Automatic Rule

The Committee on the Automatic Rule will meet at 10:30 a.m.
on Tuesday, June 3, 1975. At that time the Committee will consider
the following groups of students, who have fallen under the Auto-
matic Rule, for possible immediate reinstatement:

1. those students who failed to meet the conditions of Academic

Probation required of them at the end of the current Spring
Term:

2. those students completing a full academic year who failed

to meet the cumulative average required of their class.

The Committee will consider for immediate reinstatement all
students who fall under the Automatic Rule. If any student wishes
to inform the Committee of extenuating circumstances present in his
case, he may write a letter to the Committee and deliver it to the
Office of the Déan of the College before June 3. Immediate rein-
statement is the exception rather than the rule. A student who
falls under the Automatic Rule severs his connection with the Uni-
versity; if the Committee does not grant him immediate reinstate-
ment, he may apply for reinstatement afer a minimum of one year.

As soon as possible afer the Committee's meeting, each student
falling under the Automatic Rule will receive a letter explaining his
status; his parents will receive a copy of that letter.

Any student who is not subject to the Automatic Rule in June
and who fails to achieve the cumulative average required at the end
of a full year for his class ‘see page 84 in Catalogue) will be on
Academic Probation for the Fall Term, and he and his parents will
receive notification.

IFC modifies Rush program

By DAVID URANO

Rush, the bizarre fraternity
practice which freshmen are
subjected to (second only to the
freshmen Natural Bridge experi-
ence), has—thank heaven—un-
dergone some changes.

Rush will be shorter. Rather
than battering freshmen senses
to the middle of October, the IFC
granted a two week reprieve and
rush will fade away at the end
of September.

Fines will be rewarded to any-
one caught abusing rush officials.
So, if anyone plans on lighting
a cigarette off the flaming head
of a rush official, it will cost
him.

Dates, the women and not the
fruit, are now considered mem-
bers of the fraternity, and there-
fore are not permitted to “dirty
rush.” Dirty rush” is the clever
and mature practice of inform-
ing ‘(usually falsely) an un-
suspecting freshman that the
members of Sly Krappa Dogma
are a bunch of perverts who
sneak around Lendy’s women’s
room at night.

Rush officials will visit the
houses periodically throughout
the rush period rather than sit-

Letters to th

Student dissatisfied
with editorial
on co-education

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Although I am not of an un-
biased opinion on the subject of
co-education at W&L, I will al-
ways respect an opposing view
if it is presented competently.
The editorial in last week's Ring-
tum Phi was not presented com-
petently. The editor's response to
Mr. Bailey's article consisted of
an unpersuasive series of argu-
ment sagainst co-education,
arguments that could have been
handled better, but were not.
Indeed, there were some points
brought up in the editorial that
deserve closer attention.

First of all, I feel there are
many among us who have not,
as Mr. Reeves proposes, “yawned
at, from the day one” Mr.
Bailey's arguments for the ad-
mission of women. Co-education
is a serious and relevant topic
for consideration, as evidenced
by the decision to establish a
special committee of the Board
of Trustees in order to examine
the possibilities. In this case,
yawning may be the sign of a
closed mind.

It is the editor's next state-
ment that particularly bothers
me: “W&L cannot, and should
not attempt to educate its stu-
dents in the ways of the world.”
Why not? It would seem to me
that “the ways of the world”
are better coped with by the
graduate who has had four years
of education in a realistic en-
vironment ‘i.e. women’. It Is
rather difficult to ignore the fact
that “the ways of the world”
include both sexes

Mr. Reeves seems to feel that
women are a part of the “pres-
sures and tediums of society at
large,” that they are distractions,
and that if co-education was in-
stituted at W&L women would be
brought in “in truckloads.

ting around one house taking
up space and drinking all of
that frat’s coke and beer. (Now
they have a chance to taste
everybody's.)

David Braun, IFC Rush chair-
man, said that the changes were
made to try to “make Rush more
enjoyable while at the same time
trying to make it more efficient.”

There are three new features
to the rush program next year:
first. an old frat will not be
rushing; second, a new frat will
be rushing; and third, for the
first time in W&L history, local
fraternities may be rushing.
Rushing where, nobody knows.

Psi Upsilon, the frat that fold-
ed in the winter, will not be
rushing freshmen because there
are no upperclassmen to do the
rushing.

Kappa Alpha, a_ fraternity
which was reactivated this year,
will have eight men rushing.
Carter Greer, the president of
KA, said that the chapter will
take over the defunct Psi U
house, pink rock and all.

As a result of a recent change
in University policy, chapters are
now allowed to relinquish all
affiliations with their nationals.

Evidently, the editor has a great
deal of respect for the seductive
powers of women; however,
there seem to be many colleges
(all eight Ivy League schools,
for example) that have opted for
co-education, despite the appar-
ent invitation for moral disorder
Mr. Reeves seems to feel must
surely follow.

At a later point in the edi-
torial, Mr. Bailey's prediction of
a better quality of students ‘if
co-education is introduced) is
somewhat brusquely pushed
aside with the statement that
the quality of entering freshmen
is decreasing everywhere. This
may be true, yet the obvious fact
remains: by decreasing the
amount of male students ad-
mitted (one type of co-education
proposed) the degree of selectiv-
ity will certainly increase.

With all respect to Mr. Reeves’
opinion, the prospect of co-edu-
cation is not being considered
because it is, as he suggests,
“eurrently fashionable in ege-
head circles;” it is being con-
sidered because it is a realistic
proposal, and one that is long
overdue in many circumstances.

Because of this, several houses
are looking into the idea of do-
ing just that which will make
the frat a local.

Braun said, “With all these
changes, next year’s rush looks
as if it will be more exciting than
ever. If nothing else, it certainly
will be different.” This remains
to be seen.

FINAL EDITION

This is the final edition of The
Ring-tum Phi for the 1974-75
academic year. Because _ this
issue will be mailed to incom-
ing freshmen during the sum-
mer, several articles pertaining
exclusively to those students have
been printed. Further, the pic-
torial essay on pages 3 and 4
has been included as a review
for those who will be graduating
and as an overview of sorts for
those who arrive in Lexington
for the first time in September.

Linens touted in letter

to parents of freshmen

Dear Parents:

The University Supply Store
offers a very convenient Rental
Linen Service for students living
in the dormitories. Since this
service has been most satisfactory
for many years, we would like
to invite your son to take ad-
vantage of its proven benefits in
the coming academic year.

We are sending this informa-
tion to you because in the past
it has been confused with other
linen services offered here in the
community. We would like to
impress upon you that THIS IS

THE ONLY LINEN SERVICE
AUTHORIZED BY THE UNI-
VERSITY.

The Rental Service consists of
a complete change of thoroughly
sterilized linens—two sheets, one
pillow slip, and three bath towels,
exchanged weekly, and one ray-
on blanket which will be cleaned
during the Christmas holidays.
The cost of this service for the
entire school year is $42.00 (plus
$1.68 Virginia sales tax). If the
blanket is not needed, the other
items are available for $37.00

Hlave you ever noticed the way
WeL appears misty and hallowed
in the evening, almost like a na-
tional shrine? Even the lowly
to the Quad takes o
an eerie appearance, as the pic-
ture at the top of the page shows.

The mists and other phenomena
cause unusual effects to occur
within the crania of WoL gentle-

men, and some poor souls take

to contemplating such deeply
philosophical questions as the
purpose and psychic individu-

ality of an egg. Others attempt
to achieve free fligitt in heavier-

than-air vehicles, and smash
into heavier-than-air inanimate
obiects. Of course, there are
those who behave in a normal

collegiate manner, spending their
time engaged in polo matches
and swim meets, as portrayed by
the gentlemen at left, or party-
ing the hours away, as Jess
Reeves, out-going editor of this
newspaper, demonstrates with a
young lady he happened to meet
at Fancy Dress.

Generals seeded in NCAA playoff

Washington and Lee’s lacrosse
team earned its fourth straight
invitation to the NCAA champ-
ionship tournament by winning
its final three games, including
a 9-5 decision last Saturday over
arch-rival Virginia.

The Generals under Coach
Jack Emmer were ranked eighth
and played at top-seeded Johns
Hopkins, the defending national

JV Lacrosse
ends its season
with a win

After dropping four of their
first five games, Washington

and Lee’s jayvee lacrosse team
rallied with three straight wins
to record a .500 season.

In the final two weeks of their
campaign the jayvees posted a
lacrosse rarity by shutting out
Virginia Military, 12-0; came
close three days later in a 14-2
win over the Norfolk Lacrosse
Club; then closed out the year

with a 9-5 win over the Roa-
noke L.C,
Coach Bill Hoatson’s fresh-

man attack trio of Gary Carp-
entier, Jim Roselle, and Rich
Grace carried most of the scor-
ing load in the three wins.

Carpentier picked up nine
goals in the last three games,
including four against Norfolk.
Roselle had four goals and seven
assists, including a two and four
performance against Norfolk,
while Grace had five goals and
eight assists, with a three and
four game against VMI.

Midfielder Pete Farren also
contributed five goals over the
final three games.

The shutout over VMI re-
venged a 7-6 loss suffered earlier
in the year. W&L led 8-0 at half-
time, and the Keydets never
threatened any of the Generals’
three goalies in the second half.

W&L came within two minutes
of repeating a whitewash against
Norfolk, but the visitors got a
pair of shots by third-team goalie
Harry Mazaheri to avoid a shut-
out.

champions, Wednesday at 4:00
p.m. It was the third time in
the past four years W&L has
traveled to Hopkins for a champ-
ionship game.

The Blue Jays defeated W&L
11-5 in a 1972 quarter final
game, and edged the Generals,
11-10, in last year’s semi-finals
game en route to the national

championship.
“We're just delighted to be in
the tournament,” said Coach

Emmer, whose young team over-
came early season injuries and
inexperience to post an overall
10-6 record. W&L defeated Roa-
noke, Rutgers and Virginia in its
last three games after earlier de-
feating the no. 1-ranked college
division team, Towson.

W&L lost early season games
to two other tournament par-
ticipants: no. 3-ranked Navy and
no. 5 Mofstra, while defeating no.
7-ranked Rutgers.

‘We are looking forward to re-
turning to Homewood Field and
playing Johns Hopkins,’ Emmer
said. “Last year’s game was an
excellent lacrosse game, and this
one should be too.”

Junior attackman Rob Morgan,
who scored four goals, and the
tight W&L defense were the key
factors in the victory over
fourth-ranked Virginia.

Morgan scored twice as W&L
took a 5-1 lead at the half,
tallied his third to give the Gen-
erals a 7-2 margin in the third
quarter, and then scored the
final goal of the game to clinch
W&L’s third straight victory over
Virginia. Attackman Don Carroll
and midfielder Jay Sindler each
had a pair of goals, and All-
American Dave Warfield had one
despite playing with a cast over
his broken thumb.

Morgan leads the Generals in
goals scored, with a regular sea-
son total of 51. Warfield has
tallied 35, while Carroll has
found the back of the net on
36 occasions.

W&L’s defense, led by goalie
Charlie Brown and defensemen
Tommy Keigler, Rob Lindsey
and John Strock shut out the
Cavaliers until just 1:33 remain-
ed in the first half. Brown re-
corded 17 saves, 11 of them in
the second half and many of
them of the spectacular variety,
to thwart Virginia’s comeback
bid.

The winner of Wednesday's
W&L-Hopkins game will find as
its opponent in the playoffs the
winner of the Maryland-Hofstra
game, on Saturday, May 24 at
either College Park, Md. o
Hempstead, N.Y.

Wé&L’s John Embree may seek
a professional tennis career

When he enrolled at Washing-
ton and Lee four years ago, John
Embree “was just hoping I could
make the tennis team.”

Today, he has such a success-
ful record that he is considering
a professional career.

“T’'d like to give it a shot,” said
Embree. “I feel that I am just
starting to reach my potential.”

Embree capped off his out-
standing collegiate career this
spring by winning the no. 1
singles of the Virginia College
Athletic Association Tournament,
in which all of Virginia's smaller
colleges compete. Embree defeat-
ed Hampton Institute's Roger de
Santis Guedes, one of the better
players in the Mid-Atlantic area
who has played in several World
Championship Tennis qualifying
events, and was invited by Mary-
land’s John Lucas to be his
doubles partner. Embree won in
Straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.

Although Hampton swept the
other five singles and all three

doubles events, Embree was
voted the VCAA “Outstanding
Player.” In his senior year,

Embree posted a 20-7 record at
no. 1 singles and led the Gen-
erals to an 18-6 team record.

For his four-year career, Em-
bree compiled a 72-26 mark in
Singles and 49-21 in doubles. He
played the no. 3 position as a
freshman, no. 2 as a sophomore
and no. 1 the past two years,
serving as team captain his senior
year.

“I want to play in a let of
tournaments this summer and
see if I can make a name for
myself,” Embree said recently.
He has had a summer job for
the past several years teaching
tennis at a country club near
Washington, D.C. (River Bend
Golf and Country Club at Great
Falls), and he'd like to find a
fulltime job as a professional at
an indoor club.

With that as a home base
Embree hopes to play in many
of the “satellite” tournaments
held in connection with the ma-
Jor Association of Tennis Pro-
fessional (ATP) events.

Embree's strongest part of his

game is his booming serve, al-
though “I’ve been disappointed
with it this year.’ To compensate,
he’s been working on his volley
(“the best part of my game
now’) and return of serve (‘the
most improved’’).

At 6’-2", Embree has the serve
advantage all tall tennis players
possess.

A native of Hinsdale, Ill., on
the outskirts of Chicago, Embree
was introduced to the game at
the age of 6 by his father, whom
he describes as “an excellent
player.” “I took part in a very
good junior development pro-
gram and was involved in clinics
and area tournaments” until age
14.

But Embree says he never took

his tennis seriously in high school
or at Deerfield Academy prep
school, and “when I chose to
come to W&L, I was just looking
for a good academic school and
hoping I could make the team.
I also wanted to play soccer.”
Embree is a four-year letterman
in soccer.

W&L tennis coach Dennis Bus-
sard thinks Embree “has an ex-
cellent chance” to make it as a
pro. “He has good strokes, and
he has what it takes to be tough
on the tennis court. He has ma-
turity, mental toughness and the
ability to concentrate very well.”

Bussard says his star player
“has enough of those qualities
that he will be a success in what-
ever he attempts.”

WésL Alumni loses
to Varsity Football

Quarterback Jack Berry threw
two touchdown passes and a pair
of conversions to lead the Varsity
to an 18-6 football victory over
Washington and Lee's Alumni
last Saturday.

Berry completed scoring tosses
of eight yards to John Moore
and 12 yards to Mark George,
and passed twice to George for
conversions. For the day, the
rising senior quarterback from
Madison completed 11 of 18
passes for 186 yards, good for
16 points.

cates. The first half ended with
the Alumni on the Varsity one-
yard line, and the Old Grads
drove to the Varsity two-yard
line late in the game before
a fumbled snap cost them the
ball.

Baizley completed 12 of 19
passes for 97 yards and one
touchdown—a 13-yard strike to
Chappy Conrad—and rushed for
another 60 yards.

For the Varsity, running backs
Peter Abitante and Ray Scott
ground out 77 yards.

The incredible lacrosse

match against Hopkins

(Continued from page 1)
Generals was a Warfield to Lar-
son combination. Larson was
standing 10 yards in front of the
goal.

With the score 3-0 W£&aL,
Hopkins began to question it-
self. There were a series of
Hopkins time-outs to re-group.
But for the rest of the after-
noon the Blue Jays could not
answer their own question.

Saturday the boys from Lex-
ington will again be underdogs
and again play in Maryland. This
time W&L will face the Uni-
versity of Maryland, in a game
to be broadcast by WLUR. Mary-
land too has stopped Hopkins
this year, 19 to 11. The Generals
will come up against a powerful
defensive squad; however, the
coaches feel that W&L will be
able to control the tempo of the
game. If that is true we could
possibly be in store for our first
National Championship game,
but as one player said, “Even if
we don’t win we are going to keep
the Big Boys honest this year.”

DeChristopher’s Prospero challenged

(Continued from page 1)

ances, such as the rapid-fire
repartee with Antonio (Frank
Friedman) and Sebastion (John
Ellis), in Act two, scene one;
he never failed to amuse the
audience with his depiction of
Gonzalo’s idealism ad nauseum.
Mr. Burch was constantly in-
novative and Gonzalo did not be-
come as boring to the audience
as he is to the usurping Dukes,
which is the case in many pro-
ductions of The Tempest. In con-
trast, John Ellis was largely un-
innovative, and rarely mustered
more than a sneer to substanti-
ate the evil nature of his role
as Sebastion.

The only one of the major
characters about whom I had
any serious reservations was
Prospero. Quite appropriately,
David DeChristopher ascertain-
ed Prospero as a moody scholar
and a necromancer. He seemed
to miss, however, the power
which his role deserves. Further-
more, the moodiness of Prospero

comes not only from a studious,
or ascetic nature, but also from
a brooding desire for revenge
against his brother. Development
of this vindictive spirit through-
out the play is imperative if his
eventual forgiveness is to achieve
a sufficient denouement, yet
Mr. DeChristopher’s Prospero
seemed to show little significant
change from beginning to end.
Despite this problem, the very
evenness of Mr. DeChristopher’s
performance was perhaps a
virtue in disguise, for his poise
and experience as an actor com-
bined to give the play a good
solidity.

Of the minor characters, Rob
Mish's Stephano should be com-
mended above all others. His
Napoleanic costume and grandi-
ose gestures served perfectly to
suggest the inclinations of a
“drunken butler’ with absurd
illusions of grandeur. Stephano’s
boon compaions, Trinculo and
Caliban, were played by Hugh
Sisson and Paul Richards. While
he came up with the right air of

buffoonery, Mr. Sisson had dif-
ficulty in deciding which English
accent he would use. Mr. Rich-
ard’s Caliban was certainly
despicable, but was not hateful
enough. Like so many other
actors, Paul abjured much of the
evil in Caliban in favor of a
sympathetic interpretation.

If I have seemed overly didac-
tic in this critique, it is only
because I respect The Tempest
above all but a select few of
the plays that I have ever seen
or read. The University Theatre's
production, despite my objection
to the one scene, is a mirthful
and thoroughly enjoyable theatre
experience. It is assuredly the
finest production of the year.
