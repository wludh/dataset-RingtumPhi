Souther, Hillman, Furay
to play WGL fall concert

by RYLAND OWEN
Phi Staff Reporter

After many weeks of searching,
Bob Morecock, Student Activi-
ties Board entertainment  co-
chairman, announced that the
SAB has contracted Asylum
recording artists, the Souther,
Hillman, Furay Band, for the
W&L fall concert.

The SHF Band will perform
Wednesday in the New Doremus
Gym and this concert will be
the group’s only Virginia per-
formance on their present tour.
Concert time is approximately
6-9 p.m.

The members of the band in-
clude: John David Souther,
writer, guitar and vocals; Chris

Stradivari

Hillman, guitar and vocals, and
Richie Furay, guitar and bass
guitar, mandolin, vocals. Along
with Souther, Hillman, Furay
are Jim Gordon, A! Perkins, and
Paul Harris, on drums, guitar
and piano respectively.

Souther, Hillman and Furay
all have an impressive back-
ground, each having been a
member of another group at
some point in the past. Furay
has played with Poco and Buf-
falo Springfield; Hillman with
the Byrds, Flying Burrito Broth-
ers, and Manassas, while Souther
has performed with Longbranch
and Pennywhistle, writing for
the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, and
Jackson Browne.

Quartet

performs tonight

The W&L Concert Guild pre-

nts its third performance this
year, with a concert by the fam-
ous Stradivari String Quartet
tonight in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

Their repetoire will include
Dvorak’s American Quartet,
‘artok’s String Quartet, and

Beethoven's String Quartet, Op.
. They have performed works
re Robert Stewart, W&L music
professor and director of the
culld, on national radio and in
concert. Last year, one of the
members of the quartet, violinist
Allen Ohmes, performed the
Stewart work “Duo for Violin
and Piano” in its premier per-
formance at Lee Chapel with ac-
companist James Avery.

The Quartet has played in Lex-
ington several times before. In
addition to the performance,
they will read and discuss string
quartet compositions written by
W&L students at a workshop in

day's service in Lee Chapel will
be “Germs, Jesus and Santa

is for real.” The service begins
at 11 a.m.

the student center.

All of the members have a
fine educational background,
with their training being done at
such music schools as the East-
ern School of Music and Julliard
School of Music. Music critic,
Robert Evett calls the group
“one of the best in the world.”

The group plays with four of
the most highly prized instru-
ments in the world, a string
quartet set made by Antonio
Stradivari in the 17th and 18th
centures. The set, owned by the
Corcoran Gallery in Washington,
D.c., has been on loan to the
quartet since 1967.

The SHF Band is not a group
that can be placed in any one
category of musical style, their
music is a mixture between
country and rock. According to
“Hit Parade’ magazine, “South-
er, Hillman and Furay make
music that sounds just fine on
a fast car on a hot road day or
night ... as moody and change-
able as the summer sky.”

Tickets are $4 in advance
and $5 at the door and can
be obtained from the SAB

office in the University Center.
The SAB needs people to help
set up for the concert and all
those interested should contact
either Bob Morecock or John
Embree.

 

ROTC loses
its standard

Sometime during the morn-
ing of Sunday, Nov. 3, the
large gray and red, fringed
ROTC flag and its staff were
removed from their stand in
Evans Dining Hall.

In ail likelihood the person
or persons who removed them
considered their removal a
lark of sorts, however the
value of the flag is in excess
of $300. The ROTC depart-
ment would like to have this
flag back. The prompt return
of the flag will preclude
further or future cost and
interrogatories.

If you are more concerned with
helping others than in receiving
help, this article is for you. The
University Federation assists in
running three community pro-
erams which help those outside
of the W&L community.

One of those programs is the
Legal Aid Society. It is run by
two students in the School of
Law, Trent Crew and Ken Harris.
They and a staff of law and
undergraduate students main-

on the staff do the actual legal
work while the others help to
keep the office open.

More difficult work and greater
rewards are available to volun-
teers who wish to help the
patients at Western State Hos-

E.C. president Ben Bailey ap-
pointed a committee of three
Monday night to investigate stu-
dent views of the honor system
and the methods of its enforce-
ment. Bob Keatley, Sandy Stradt-
min, and Elliot Hicks were
given the job of checking out
student opinion on the subject
and reporting back at next
week's meeting.

The E.C. hopes to take some
action, if it is warranted, around
the beginning of the winter term.
In the words of E.C. member
Woody Ray. it is “time to find
out.” Ben Bailey agreed that this
is the time to do something
about the honor system if any-
thing needs to be done.

Bailey cited the importance of
looking into the matter now
when people have had time to
calm down following the latest
public trial, but before they have
completely forgotten

“We might be rushing into
something half-cocked,” said
vice-president Bob Keatley. But
the committee still felt the sub-
ject merited investigation.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK,

Reflections on the
public honor trial

The mood one perceived around the Hill during the process
of last week’s trial was, at best, pessimistic. There seemed to
be a pervading feeling that a jury trial, held before the stu-
dent body, could not achieve a dispassionate review of the
facts. Some felt that the public honor trial procedures could
stand serious revisions, Others went as far as to wish that
there be no jury trial at all, and opted for complete control of
honor violations by closed sessions of the E.C, In any case,
the mood was undeniably one of more skepticism than hope
on the prospect of a trial in which justice would be tempered
a bit too much by merey.

It is true that the rules covering the procedure of a public
honor trial are weighted heavily in favor of the defendant.
The prosecution is, in fact, rendered totally impotent under
the present system, Not only is it denied the right of “voir
dire” jury selection, but also it suffers a complete lack of
representation during the trial. Thus, the prosecution is not
on the stage to object to motions or questions of the defense,
and cannot lead the questioning of the witnesses and the
defendant himself in such a way as to make clear its allega-
tions.

Just as it would be patently unjust if there was no higher
appeal than the F.C, for an accused violator of the Honor
System, so it seems inconsistent that the E.C, is not allowed
to demonstrate, before the jury and in public, its reasons for
having convicted the man in the first place. This is not to
suggest that the E.C. enlist the support of “hired guns” from
Tucker Hall, One of the F.C, members should be perfectly
able to conduct the affairs of the case with sufficient ability.
The obvious result of this equal representation would be
a more balanced direction of the jury’s thoughts towards the
crucial points of the case.

In spite of the readily demonstrable shortcomings of the
public honor trial as it is presently conducted, there does re-
main one incontrovertably good byproduct of its existense—
it gets the campus involved in and talking about the Honor
System. One would have to have been blind and deaf not
to perceive the intense interest with which last week's trial
was received, Virtually everyone had something to say
about th trial, and no one, save the worms who rarely leave
the fifth level stacks of MeCormick Library, can now say that
he does not understand the workings and implications of the
Honor System, The public honor trial accomplishes what
it places
the Honor System in the storefront window, and makes the

no closed door session of the E.C, could hope for

knowledge of its presence an unavoidable consequence of
W&L life.
—B.S.

The student jury

We have allowed an editorial to be printed here by a mem-
ber of our staff whose opinions we felt were worthy of
being aired, His conclusion is that the Honor System and the
public honor trial are both still viable although some pro-
cedural changes need to be made.

Unfortunately we are no longer sure that we can agree with
him in his optimistic outlook. We very much hope and believe
that the honor is still important to the overwhelming majority
of students at W&L. However, we can no longer be sure that
a public honor trial by students insures in the least way that
justice will be served,

We question the premise that a group of twelve randomly
selected students has the ability or desire to pass a fair
verdict in a trial. Perhaps it is impossible at such a small
school to find twelve students who could be considered to be
an impartial jury with no direct or indirect knowledge of a
student, his associations or his character, Perhaps they are
simply unwilling to pass judgment on one of their number,
Perhaps they find the absolute penalty unacceptable,

If the student jury is to be kept then it should be composed
of students who have no knowledge of the defendant, his
associations or any other factors which might cloud their
judgment. They should believe in the Honor System and be
willing without reservation to render a verdict of guilty with
out regard to the penalty, They are only ask to determine
guilt or innocense, To do this we feel that they must believe
in the Honor System as it now stands, including the absolute

penalty,

If it is impossible to compose such a jury then the whole
left to the EC,
represent us and to willingly sit in judgment on their peers,

matter should be \iter all, we elected them to

They have proved themselves able to do this,

If some sort of appeal is absolutely necessary then take it
to the faculty or a selected portion of the faculty, If the
code cannot be effeciently run under the public jury system
something should be done to make it work or it should be
dispensed with it altogether,

Grade inflation backfires:
GPRs become less important

By PAUL LANCASTER
Managing [Editor

Editor's note—This is third in
a series of articles on grading
at Washington and Lee. This
week, Ring-tum Phi managing
editor Paul J. Lancaster presents
a look at the meaning of grade
inflation:

Ten years ago, 18 percent of
the undergraduate senior class
at Washington and Lee was
graduated with honors.

By last year, that percentage
had doubled to 36 percent of the
graduating class.

Five years ago, before the 12-
12-6 week semester system was
instituted, the combined fall and
winter term honor roll bore the
names of 232 undergraduates
(Some, of course, were named to
the honor roll in both the fall
and winter terms). Last year, the
number of names listed on the
combined fall and winter term
honor roll had increased to 430.
No honor roll is released for the
spring term.

Consequently, 667 names were
listed on the university’s combin-
ed fall and winter dean’s list five
years ago. Some 1,051 names
were on the combined dean’s list
last year.

This, despite a rise in enroll-
ment in those five years of only
about 10 percent.

As mentioned in an earlier
article in this series, the average

senior grade point ratio at Wash-
ington and Lee has increased
from 2.597 in 1967-68 to 2.761
last year,

So what?

Before attempting to answer
the above question, a few grad-
ing situations in other colleges
around the country, as noted in
this week's issue of Time maga-
zine, should be mentioned.

At Stanford University, the
average grade point ration is
3.5. There are no grades of “D”
or “F” given at Stanford. The
use of the pass-fail system is
widespread.

At Yale University, 42 percent
of the undergraduate grades
given during the school’s spring
term were grades of “A”. Slightly
less than last year’s undergradu-
ate senior class was graduated
with honors.

At American University, three-
fourths of spring terms grades
last year were grades of “A”
oo.

At the University of Pitts-
burgh, the average grade five
years ago was a “C”. It is now
as’.

Again, so what?

Some of the reasons for the
upturn in grades at Washington
and Lee and across the country
were explored in an earlier article
in this series. They will not be
repeated here.

The answer to the “so what?”

Ask Traveller

DEAR TRAVELLER--What is the Honor System?
(Signed) R.E.R. Huntley
DEAR R.E.R.—A myth, for all practical purposes. I perceive by the
tone of your inquiry that you are some neophyte freshman, and
let me assure you the Honor System became a myth long before
you ever threw up your first Evans Dining Hall chickeetti lunch
here. The Honor System disappeared because of people continu-

ally outwardly claiming its existence while denying that exist-
ence to themselves.

The Honor System as its stands today, and as it has stood
for some time, is a cross between the United Nations and Dean
John’s smile—it's always there, but you've got to wonder if it
does anything.

The Honor System does exist in structure, to be sure. The
outstanding tradition of this school has carried the Honor System
unchanged from the time of Uncle Bob Lee and his trusty steed
(who shall go unnamed here) to today. The structure exists, and
the structure is indeed appropriate for this university—if we were
back in the 1860's.

There's a problem today, though—-the structure, particularly
the idea of an absolute penalty lives on, but the mind that
formulated that structure rests only in two places on campus—-
underneath Lee Chapel, and in room 32A of Washington Hall,
where Dr. Fenwick Castledorm may be found at ease in his
rocking wheel chair, rocking contently back and forth and
asking if Sherman has reached Atlanta yet.

Elsewhere, the mind behind the Honor System has disappear-
ed, at least in reference to the absolute penalty. Indeed, a poll
conducted last year showed that some 60 percent of the student
body didn’t believe in the use of the absolute penalty—be it ex-
pulsion or a two-semester linked course with Dr. Putch, without
the benefit of a shirt and tie—as the only form of punishment
in a public honor trial. Which means if any twelve students
are selected at random from the student body, any seven will
probably be against ruling in favor of using the absolute penalty,
even if less than five of the jurors happen to belong to the
defendant's fraternity house.

So, that sums up briefly the Honor System here. W&L main-
tains pride in not delineating what constitutes an honor offense.
This is noble, yet, it, too has contributed its share to the mythi-
fication of the Honor System. There is a move to outline such
violations, It would be essentially a codification of criteria
established in previous honor trials. Among some of the possible
delineations:

~-You can plagiarize up to 43 times without having to worry
about conviction.

-~-You can lie about your age to the clerk at the ABC store.

You can permanently borrow ash trays from the library.

-—You can cheat, as long as you don't get caught.

Thus, the Honor System is still a thriving, viable entity of
the Washington and Lee community—at least it is up in Wash-
ington 32A,

inquiry may not lie within the
bounds of the universities them-
selves. The answer, instead, lies
in the realm of job- and gradu-
ate school-hunting.

The current grade inflation
may simply exlain why graduate
schools ask for criteria other
than grades when looking over
applications. Grades simply
aren't reliable. If American Uni-
versity gives out 75 percent of
its grades as grades of “A” or
“B”, to simply look at grades
would mean that a higher per-
centage of American University
students would be accepted to
graduate school than would, say,
Washington and Lee students.

Indeed, the overall inequity of
the grading system prompted
standardized tests for admission
to graduate school, and the cur-
rent trend of grade inflation is
taking more and more emphasis
away from grades and putting it
on standardized tests.

The reasoning is simple. Cer-
tainly a graduate school in law,
for example, can’t take the time
to analyze whether a Washing-
ton and Lee student’s 3.1 is bet-
ter than an American Univer-
sity student's 3.3. What if the
Washington and Lee student is
a fine arts major? That would
certainly make a difference than
if he was a major in economics
here. The same inequities by de-
partment certainly exist at other
universities, too.

The standardized test simply
places all applicants to a gradu-
ate school on more or less equal
footing. And, although there may
be certain inherent biases to-
ward some types of students in
standard tests, these biases
simply do not effect the wide
range of discrepancies among
university grading systems or,
indeed, among departmental
grading systems in a given uni-
versity.

Grade inflation, both at Wash-
ington and Lee and at colleges
across the nation, is thus fore-
ing graduate school to place less
and less importance on grades.

Everyone is gettting higher
grades, The result is that those
higher grades aren't helping the
student get into graduate school.

The same goes for students
seeking employment immediately
following graduation. Looking at
journalism for a moment, there
seems to be an increasing em-
phasis on experience. Every year,
there are four journalism gradu-
ates for each journalism job
opening. If a small percentage of
students graduated with, say, a
3.0 or above, grades will certainly
be a relatively important factor
in job-hunting. But if a large
percentage of journalism stu-
dents graduate with a 3.0 or
above, grades lose their signific-
ance.

This is what is happening, both
at Washington and Lee and at
colleges everywhere. Grades are
losing their significance, Every-
one is getting better grades, but
no one is beneliting from them.

This is, of course, an over-

Letters
To he Editor

Art in Taiwan

Editor, the Ring-tum Phi:

I am writing this letter in
support of the Washington and
Lee Foreign Studies program and
to express my appreciation to
Professor Ju and the university
for allowing me, a former W&L
student, to participate in the pro-
gram on Chinese Art in Taiwan
this past spring. It is only now
after some months that I can
write this letter, as the memory
of day to day inconveniences of
a first pioneering effort fade
and the lasting significance of
the experiences continues to
grow.

As far as a cultural guide, I
can think of no one more chap-
able and willing than Mr. Ju.
His information and insights in-
to China rival those of the most
prominent Chinese scholars, sev-
eral of whom we met. As hard
as it may seem, he was able to
breathe life into the museums,
adding fresh life and depth to
the ancient paintings hanging
there. I'm not trying to over-
look the hassles, the frantic pace
and rough schedule which left
me and I think everyone else,
drained, but I need to say that I
am glad that I could take part in
such a program, an important
program, and maybe the most
significant first effort of its kind.

There’s an old football adage
which says that teams don’t win
many games without offense, and
that they lose a lot without de-
fense.

When both forces boycott a
team for sixty minutes, the end
result usually resembles Pompei
after Mount Vesuvius erupted.

Such was the case at the Colis-
seum—make that Wilson Field—
on Saturday as Washington and
Lee again played a_ lackluster
football game, falling to Denison
(O.) University, 35-6, before a
disgruntled crowd of 3,000 on
Parent’s Day.

In seeing their record slip to
1-7-1, the Generals went for the
second week in a row without a
strong offensive attack, while the
defense joined the pointgetters
on the list of the missing.

The Big Red piled up 401 yards
in the afternoon, with 300 of
them coming on the ground.
Meanwhile the Denison defense
held W&L to eight first downs
and only 172 yards on offense.

“We were controlled at the
line of scrimmage both on ot-
fense and on defense all after-
noon,” said WL head coach Bill
McHenry after the game. “What
it meant was we could not do
what we had planned, and that
we had to play catchup all game

: long?”

As costly as the lack of control
at the line was the five turn-
overs W&L suffered in the game,
the highest number of giveaways
in any 1974 game. Two of the
turnovers set up Denison touch-
downs.

The Big Red jumped out to a
7-0 lead in the first quarter,
when fullback Rich Simeone
capped an eight play, 68-yard
drive with a three-yard scoring
burst. Sieone, who in 1973 gain-
ed 250 yards against W&L, pick-
ed up 34 yards on four carries
in the first Denison scoring drive.
Jim Piper's conversion was good.

The Generals closed the gap to
7-6 on the following possession,
with the aid of the Bid Red's

lone turnover of the game. Scott
Dingler fumbled a George Makris
punt at the Denison 31, and
W&L’s Sal Abbruzzese recovered.

Two plays later, quarterback
Jack Berry found tight end Tony
Perry in the corner of the end
zone, where the sophomore All-
American candidate made a fine
grab of a 33-yard scoring pass.
W&L lined up as if they would
attempt to kick the extra point,
but again the coaches, hoping to
capitalize on what they saw in
scouting the Bid Red, tried for
the two-point conversion on a
fake.

This time, however, Denison
reacted perfectly, and Berry had
no one to throw to. A pass in-
tended for Mark George was
thrown into a crowd, and W&L
still trailed 17-6.

The Generals had a chance to
turn the game around early in
the second quarter, when Jeff
Slatcoff blocked a Denison punt,
and W&L took over at the Big
Red 18.

On first down Berry tried for
a quick touchdown by sending
running back Raynard Scott out

on a ‘swing fly” pattern. Denison
saw the play coming, and Scott
was triple-teamed in the end
zone. Dave Holcombe intercept-
ed, and the Generals had seen
their last serious threat wasted
by a turnover.

Later in the quarter, after a
Denison punt had set W&L deep
in their own territory, fullback
Mercer West fumbled, and Deni-
son’s Ken DeCrane recovered at
the Generals’ 14. Three plays
later Sieone scored his second
touchdown, this one from five
yards out. Piper’s conversion
made it 14-6.

Another W&L turnover set the
Big Red up for the third touch-
down of the first half late in
the second quarter. Perry could
not handle an overthrown pitch
from Berry on an end-around
option play, and Denison’s Den-
nis Thomas recovered at the
Generals’ 38.

The Big Red then used just
five plays to score, with Jim Bar-
rett sweeping left end for the
final seven yards. Piper’s kick
gave Denison a 21-6 halftime
led.

mM WL parents see Denison romp

Denison increased their lead
on the opening possession of the
second half. Quarterback Danny
Ross engineered a nine-play, 70-
yard drive that culminated when
he bootlegged the right side for
a three-yard touchdown. Includ-
ed in the drive were three passes
by Ross that were good for 59
yards. Piper’s kick made it 28-6.

Later in the third quarter the
Generals moved into Denison ter-
ritory but could not move and
were forced to give up the ball.
it was the only occasion that
W&L crossed the midfield stripe
in the second half.

The Big Red added their final
touchdown late in the game,
after a Makris punt took a Deni-
son bounce before being downed
at the W&L 30. Reserve quarter-
back George Powell scored on a
five-yard run with 1:28 left
Piper again converted to round
out the scoring.

Soccer ties VMI, loses to Navy

By The Phi Sports Staff

A tie and a shutout loss closed
out a dismal 1974 soccer season
for Washington and Lee last
week,

The Generals were tied by
next-door neighbor VMI, 1-1, on
Tuesday, then were shutout by
nationally ranked Navy, 4-0, at
Annapolis on Saturday.

The winless week left W&L
with a 4-5-3 season mark.

Playing without three starters
against VMI, W&L was out-
hustled and out-finessed for most
of the game. The Keydets jump-
ed to a 1-0 lead early in the
second half after a W&L de-
fensive breakdown left goalie
Paul Devine alone against two

VMI forwards.

W&L tied the score with 20
minutes left, as Bill Cogar capi-
talized on a goalie error to score
into an open net. Several chances
late in the game went for naught,
and suddenly the Generals’ found
themselves with a giant task to
salvage a winning season.

It was a bit much to ask. W&L
found itself up against a big,
fast soccer team in the Midship-
men, who have been in the Top
20 in the nation since early in
the year.

Navy kept the pressure on
throughout the game, and Devine
did well to hold the middies to
four goals.

The W&L junior varsity also

lost its season finale last week,
falling to Lynchburg’s JV’s, 2-1.

Coached by law student George
Lantzas, the JV’s finished with
a 3-3-1 mark. Led by tri-cap-
tains Sandy Bishop, Plater Rob-
inson, and John Crutcher, the
future varsity Generals averag-
ed 3.7 goals per game.

Lantzas noted that while the
Wé&L JV’s were exclusively a
freshman squad, never once did
they play an all-freshman team.

A former W&L soccer player
himself. Lantzas called this year’s
freshman team “the most dedi-
cated and talented group of
freshmen to ever play soccer
here.”

“They'll be a strong basis for
the future,” Lantzas added.

Moliere play opens Monday

(Continued from page 1)
The play will be presented in
period costume, modeled after
the dress of the subjects of the
Spanish painter Velazquez. The
costumes will lend to the period
atmosphere of the play.

Gordon said he chose the play
because the title character repre-
sents a “modern existential figure
in his period.” Don Juan con-
stantly comes out of the play’s
period setting to communicate
with the 20th century audience,
Gordon explained.

“Don Juan” is today one of
the most popular of Moliere’s
works, although it was with-
drawn from the French stage
soon after it opened. Translator
Christopher Hampton explains
that “those qualities which con-
demned the play in the eyes of
Moliere’s contemporaries ... are
precisely the qualities which
commend it to modern audiences,
accustomed as they are ... to
the mixture of knockabout farce
and metaphysical speculation

simplification. Students who
continue to perform particularly
well in college—those at Wash-
ington and Lee, for instance, who
will graduate magna and summa
cum laude—will most likely be
able to rely on their grades to
take them where they want to
co. But those at Washington and
Lee with a high, but not excep-
tional, ratio simply cannot rely
on their grades to get them a
job or a place in a graduate
school,

And, of course, some colleges,

and even some departments
within some colleges, have their
reputations. Certainly many

businesses and graduate schools
rely on these reputations. The
student being graduated from
these colleges or college depart-
ments with high grades may still
be able to count on those grades
to get him where he wants to go,

That is the essential answer to
the ‘so what?” inquiry. The
question remains as to what can
be done. That question cannot
be answered within the scope of
this series of articles.

That is the situation as it cur-
rently stands. Everyone wants
higher grades to get them a job

or a position in a graduate school.
And everyone is getting those
higher grades. And, consequent-
ly, businesses and graduate
schools are placing less and less
emphasis on grades.

Perhaps, then, as grades be-
come less and less important to
businesses and graduate schools,
the rate of grade inflation may
slow and, maybe someday, stop.
Indeed, if the journalism major,
for example, puts more emphasis
into working for a newspaper as
a stringer or working on the

_ What effect does grade inflation have?

even be a grade recession, at
least in journalism. Experience
is more important, in this
instance; students thus work
more at getting experience than
at getting high grades; grades
consequently decline.

Then, perhaps, grading will
again become an important con-
sideration of businesses and
eraduate schools, and the cycle
will begin again.
