‘Changing Room’ to open Monday

accents to the action
itself. naturalism is the domi-
nant characteristic in ‘The
Chang.ng Room” by David
Storey, the play that opens
Monday, March 24, at the Uni-
versity Theatre.

The play—the enactment of
an afternoon with a British
rugby team, not on the field
but before and after its game,
as well as during halftime—
offers perhaps the most diffi-
cult challenge to the performers
of any play in recent years, ac-
cording to Lee Kahn, Univer-
sity Theatre director. “It is
completely an actor's script.”

Because on-stage physical ac-
tivity is at a minimum, the
“action” of the play is almost
wholly in the verbal exchange
between the men—two dozen of
whom are on stage throughout
the entire play, Kahn notes.

Kahn had to keep that in mind
even in casting the play. He
selected the actors as a single

Frem

Phi Beta Kappa to add
26 members this year
at Tuesday ceremony

Claude 8S. George Jr., associate
dean of the Graduate School of
Business Administration at the
University of North Carolina
(Chapel Hill), will be the speaker
next Tuesday, March 25, at the
annual Phi Bet Kappa convoca-
tion,

George will speak at 12:30 p.m.
in Lee Chapel. He has given his
address the title “The Unexamin-
ed Life,” taken from Plato's
statement, “The unexamined is
not worth living.”

Because of the speech, classes
will be shortened next Tuesday.

A total of 26 newly elected Phi
Beta Kappa members will be in-
ducted in the 199-year-old so-
ciety at a banquet Tuesday eve-
ning. The initiates include 18
undergraduate seniors, seven
juniors, one 1974 graduate and
two faculty members at the uni-
versity.

George is a native of Danville
who has taught at Chapel Hill
since 1954. He holds the Ph.D.
from Iowa State, and taught
previously at lowa and Texas.

He is the author of “Manage-
ment Thought,” and has con-
tributed many articles to profes-
soinal journals in his field. He
is a fellow of the American
Academy of Management and is
a member of numerous other pro-
fessional and scholarly societies.

His 12:30 address in Lee Chapel
is open to members of the public,

unit—a company—rather than
designating individual roles for
individual actors. Only after they
had worked with the play in a
general, improvisational way for
about two weeks were specific
roles assigned to actors, Kahn
says—and by then, each actor,
for the most part, had gravitated
toward a particular part on his
own.

To add to the actors’ feeling
for the characters, cast members
even played rugby, familiarizing
themselves with the “environ-
ment,’ mental as well as physical,
in which a rugby team lives.

Because the play is set in
Yorkshire, the requirements of
total naturalism dictated that
the actors speak with authentic
accents, In order to alleviate this
problem, a voice coach who
specializes in accents, Deborah
Ross, has spent two weekends
with the cast training the actors
in the peculiarities of the York-
shire speech pattern. Ross is a
faculty member at the American
Academy of Dramatic Arts in
New York, of which Kahn is the

newly named executive vice
president,

With no single ‘leading’ role,
Kahn's actors have developed

their own physical movements,
exactly as they would if they
were actual team members.

The principal challenge to the
cast, he points out, is the need
for “acute listening.” The play is
essentially an exchange among
24 men of locker-room type “one

liners,” with each man respond-
ing to each other man’s com-
ments, jokes, questions and the
like.

The unusual difficulty in act-
ing in “The Changing Room,”
the result of its psychological
rather than physical nature, is
typical of the playwright, Kahn
says. Storey himself played on a
rugby team in Yorkshire, and the
play is largely autobiographical.

Reflecting Storey’s own exeri-
ence, most of the rugby players
in “The Changing Room” play
the game for one or another of
just two reasons—for the glory
it brings once a week to an other-
wise deadly monotonous life, or
simply for the money—about $40
-——they receive for each game,
often the difference between pov-
erty and a few luxuries.

Team members in Yorkshire
and in the play alike resent the
occasional man who tries to
break out of that existence. Kahn
says the careful observer will
recognize the character in “The
Changing Room’ who, like
Storey, fits that role too.

The play was first produced
in America three years ago to
critical acclaim on Broadway
after a major success in London.
The University Theatre’s pro-
duction—which runs through
Saturday—is one of the first in
America by a college theatre.

Curtain time is 8 pm, each
evening, and advance reserva-
tions should be made by calling

Co-op tries

By the Phi News Staff

The cashier's counter has been
moved in the Co-op, to help ex-
pedite service and eliminate a
possible health hazard,

James Toler, manager of the
University Supply Store, reports
that some time ago he received
a complaint from someone on
campus who noticed that the
same attendants who prepared
food were handling the cash
register and making change.
While they try to wash their
hands before handing food, it
is virtually impossible to do so
every time, particularly during
the peak “counter crunches” be-
tween class periods.

The person who made the com-
plaint suggested that Toler
look into the possibility of pro-
viding a separate § cashier's
counter, and so segregate food-
hadling from money handling.

Checking with the local Health
Department, Toler found that
allhough the old system was not
in direct violation of any regula-
tion, it would be preferable if
the cash register were moved

With the new system, the
workers behind the snack counter
trade off on the cashier's
job, providing a break from con-
stantly preparing students’
orders. More counter space is
now available for use in food
preparation, And finally, people
who only make a small purchase,
such as a bag of potato chips,
can pay for it more quickly than

The grain platform

When considering the imposing list of candidates for class
offices one should keep in mind the particularly important
function of the presidents of each class. These men will be
entrusted with the class dues they collect after their election
and will be expected to organize the grain parties for their
classes. One must be aware of the fact that the grain cocktail
party is perhaps the most important historical event since the
death of Garland, the birth of the blues, and the freezing of
spinach.

Gary Seldomridge, Kim Ratliff, and Scott Stevenson are
the candidates for Senior President of the 1975-76 academic
year. Each of these gentlemen probably could make a more
than adequate showing in arranging a cocktail party. We know
for a fact that Mr. Seldomridge, President of this year’s
junior class, began making plans for the spring grain gala
after the questionable freshman showing on Fancy Dress
weekend. It is impossible to evaluate his performance at
this point, but we are sure that he will execute his duties
satisfactorily. We must, in all fairness, state that Mr. Ratliff
would also show a worldly knowledge of mixing grain if he
is given that opportunity by his peers.

For the office of Junior President Bill Craver faces Tom
Hunter next Monday. The first is a Pi Kappa Alpha while
the latter is a Phi Kappa Sigma. This choice presents us with
something of a dilemma as both should be able to handle
their appointment with the required expertise. We know that
Mr. Craver treats grain alcohol with the reverence second to
none and would quarantee a superior punch complemented
by fine examples of gatoring.

The freshman class candidates for the head of their class
include Rodney Cook (again), Mike Cleary, and George
Triplett. Mr. Cook could probably discharge his duties but
perhaps with a bit more finesse than was the case this year.
He seems extremely defensive about his grain party and shows
a somewhat unfortunate attitude toward the affair. Mr. Cook:
anything can be improved upon—even the grain party which
you and your cronies thought perfect. If you realize that a
good thing can be made better in amost all cases, then
perhaps such open-mindedness will result in a better grain
party next year by the sophomore class. In any event, we
wish the rising sophomore class luck; any of the gentlemen
running for this office would be satisfactory to some degree.

Honor System changes explained

At our request, the President-
elect of the Student Body Leland
McCullough submitted this art-
icle on the changes in the Honor
System which the Executive
Committee has approved. These
changes listed here go into effect
on March 24 at 12:01 a.m.

Over the past several months
the EC has undertaken an ex-
tensive examination of the Honor
System, We have attempted to
gauge the public sentiment in
many ways, including student
questionnaires, Lee Chapel ‘town
meetings,” faculty interviews,
and heavily publicized open EC
hearings. This input has moved
us to make the following
changes:

The first change involves the
duty of a student when he sus-
pects a violation, Under the pres-
ent system, he must immediately
turn any suspected violation over
to the EC. We believe that it
is important to give students who
are unsure about whether a viola-
tion has occurred the option of
confonting the suspected student
and asking for an explanation of
the incident. If the suspected
student provides a satisfactory
explanation and is able to show
that there was a misunderstand-
ing, then the matter may be
dropped. If the explanation is
unsatisfactory and further in-
vestigation is necessary, then the
student must bring the violation
to the Executive Committee.
Hopefully, this will prevent minor
misunderstandings from being
blown up into major honor trials.

One change was made in the
private hearing. The accused will
be able to request an extended
recess after six hours. This will
make sure that the accused and
the EC will be attentive to all
evidence and will not be exhaust-
ed and lose concentration during
a drawn-out trial.

Perhaps the most important
change in the public hearing is
the introduction of an advocate
for the EC. Many students have
felt that the public hearing has
been weighted in favor of the
accused. We believe that an EC
advocate would add much-need-
ed balance and direction. Under
the new public trial process, both
the EC and the accused will have
up to two advocates. The EC
presents its side first, and then
the accused presents his defense.
Both sides may cross-examine
witnesses. The jury retains the
right to call witnesses and ask
questions, They do this after both
sides have finished. After all
evidence has been presented, the
EC advocates and the accused
deliver a final statement.

Some have argued that these
changes may tilt the scales of
justice against the accused, How-
ever, we have taken several steps
to ensure a fair and equitable
trial; 1) the EC will no longer
deliver the summary of reasons
why the accused was found guilty.

Letters to the

W&L Swing rises
to new spiritual heights
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

In as many places as the “Wash-
ington and Lee Swing,”—perhaps
the most popular college song in
the entire United States—has
been used, I wonder whether the
church I serve in Ft. Lauderdale
may not have scored a new first
with it this past Sunday. In a

peak of the tourist season, it was

The continuing saga of Wood’s Creek; .

BY STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

The observant student crossing
the footbridge over Wood's Creek
may think to himself that W&L’'s
new apartment complex seems
mighty far from completion,
particularly if that same student
is planning to occupy one of the
apartments next autumn,

Unfortunately, at least one of
the three units is considerably
far from being finished.

Job conferences, at which the
work in progress is discussed, are
held every two weeks on the
Wood's Creek project. At the
most recent of these meetings, a
representative of the architectur-
al firm of Marcellus Wright, Cox,
Cilimberg and Ladd reported that
the West unit, the building near-
est the footbridge, is only 35%
complete. The central structure
was half finished, while the East
unit was reported as 60% com-
plete.

Kane Construction Company,
the contracting firm, maintains
that it will have all three build-
ings completed by its revised May
1 deadline. However, W&L ad-
ministrators most closely con-
nected with the project believe
that it is realistic to assume that
only two buildings, at best, will
be nearing completion in May,
but hope that the third will be
ready by September.

Frank Parsons, assistant to
President Huntley, feels that the
East and Central units will be
finished by May 1, weather per-
mitting, after which time the
contractor would presumably re-
assign all crews to the remaining
building to facilitate the swift
completion of the whole project.

“We realistically think that the
apartments will be completed
sometime this summer,” Parsons
said in an interview. “The Uni-
versity is extremely eager to get
the job done and get our stu-
dents settled in these buildings.”

William Mohler, Director of
University Services, is not quite
80 optimistic. “To be frank, my
feeling is that it is conveivable
that the East and Central build-
ings will bear habitation by the
fall. The West building—I have
grave doubts about it. It's drag-
ging considerably.” That unit
will eventually accomodate 76
students, out of a total of 178
in the whole project.

Agreeing with Mohler is Lewis
John, Dean of Students, who also
has reservations about the West
unit. Having the contractor's
word and the reports of the
architects, however, John and
Mohler are proceeding to offer
for rental all of the apartments,
under essentially the same pro-
visions as last year. Those provi-
sions include a refundable de-
posit of $100, and a non-binding
lease that may be broken by
the maker at any time prior to
the completion of the units.
Rental rates remain unchanged
from last year's figures.

Several months ago the project

The Alexander-

was reported as keeping to the
revised construction schedule.
What happened this time? ,

For one thing, there have been
significant delays in the pouring
of concrete at the West building
site, owing to the presence of
some overhead wires at a critical
spot. The Virginia Electric and
Power Company has been slow
to relocate these lines in an
underground cable, and because
of the danger of fouling the lines
construction on that site has
been hampered.

Also to blame for recent de-
lays are the effects of internal
personnel changes in the Kane
corporation. Supervisors have
been reassigned, and the top
management levels at the branch
office handling the project have
been drastically reshuffled.

A further complication result-
ed indirectly from increased fed-
eral government regulation of
cement plants. Stringent EPA
requirements forced the shut-
down of a considerable number
of marginal cement plants, and
so caused a shortage of ready-
mixed cement for a period of
time. With the recent stagnation
of the building industry in gen-
eral, though, there have been
few problems in obtaining the
quantities of cement required by
the construction.

Normally, weather is taken into
account in a contractor's calcula-
tions as to the length of time
needed for the completion of a
given project. The occurrence of
too many rainy days will prompt
him into claiming adverse
weather conditions as a factor
in hindering rapid construction.
While Kane has not yet done
so, the occasion of a few more
wet days, such as in the past
weeks, will probably encourage
him to place blames on the rain.

Last year the weather was
claimed to have been the chief
culprit in delaying construction,
which was begun in October of
1973, The apartments, which

Many felt this procedure auto-
matically biased the jury, 2) the
EC advocates may not refer to
deliberations in the private hear-
ing, 3) advisors for the accused
may call witnesses and ask ques-
tions. Under the old system, they
could not speak in his behalf.
4) the jury will no longer be
able to see the transcript from
the private hearing. This was
done because the EC is of the
opinion that the purpose of the
public hearing is to give the
accused an entirely new trial.
Unfortunately, use of the tran-
script in the past has made the
public trial only an appeal of
the EC hearing, and has focused
the attention of the jury on
evidence from the original trial.
Elimination of the transcript
frees the jury to examine the
witnesses and sift through the
evidence as it is brought out by
the two sides, without being in-
fluenced by evidence from the
witnesses and sift through the
evidence as it is brought out by
the two sides, without being in-

held in the sanctuary to provide
sociability for our monthly art
exhibit.

Reasons for choosing the
“Swing” for our service include:

1. The sermon topic was: “The
Philosophy of George Washing-
ton,”

2. Our guest speaker, the Rev-
erand Horace Barhelder, pastor
of First Parish Church, Ply-
mouth, Mass., founded in 1620
by the Pilgrims, is a W&L man,

3. We wanted to have some-
thing in the service to thrill those
tourists present, especially from
Virginia and the Carolinas.

Enough is enough

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to express my
thanks to the tri-captains of the
Washington and Lee lacrosse
team for their open letter to the
W&L fans in last week's Phi. As
a self-confessed over-zealous fan
it was a bitter pill to swallow.
Although I would never partici-
pate in, nor condone the racial
Jeering that was so evident in
the Morgan State game, I must
admit that my comments at
previous games could certainly

fluenced by evidence from the
original hearing.

The procedure for selecting the
jury for the public hearing was
changed to ensure an impartial
jury. The Chairman of the pub-
lic hearing will ask each pro-
spective juror, “Do you know
the accused personally?” Then
both sides will ask questions to
determine the extent of the re-
lationship. A close personal rela-
tionship with the accused will be
considered cause for striking the
prospective juror. This removes
the burden of deciding partiality
from the juror and places it on
the totally impartial Chairman,
the President of the Student Bar
Association. Each side will also
have two peremptory challenges,

The timing of the public trial
has also been changed. The old
rules specified that the public
trial must be held within fifteen
days after the private hearing.
Now it must be held within five
days; however, an extension can
be granted by the Chairman. This

be characterized as less than dis-
creet and my criticism of the
opposing team’s players as some-
what less than _ constructive.
Thus, I saw myself in that let-
ter and I hope it will change
the outlook of other Washington
and Lee fans the way I know it
has changed mine.

In the excitement of a W&L
game, particularly one such as
lacrosse where the fans are
separated from the opposing
team by some distance, it is
often easy to forget that there
are real people inside those
helmets and uniforms who think
and feel very much the way every
W&L player and fan thinks and
feels. They hate to lose as badly
as we do. For our fans to add
unnecessary insult to an already
painful loss can only diminish
Washington and Lee’s stature in
the eyes of every school we play.

Washington and Lee’s phe-
nomenal success in lacrosse is
even more amazing when consid-
ered in the light of the type of
non-subsidized sports program
we have, a program where team
members are student-athletes,
not just merchandize. In the
spirit of this type of program I
hope we can gain a new per-
spective on all of our athletic
contests and approach each game
with the same sense of sports-
manship that is exhibited by the

DEAR TRAVELLER—I don't understand. I went to cast my ballot
in Monday's Big Three elections, and I couldn't find Doug
Schwartz's name anywhere. I miss phrases like “viable alterna-

tive” and “executive fiat” and “B-L-T, hold the mayo.”
(Signed) Bernice
DEAR B—Sorry, kid, but Doug has been graduated to the real world,
where he now wears a three-piece suit over his cutoff blue jeans.
Rumor has it he'll be back in the Big Lex in May to defend Al
Black in an honor trial on charges of blatant averageness.

No, this year’s Big Three elections, named for the collective
IQ of the student body government, featured no such visible
and vociferous candidates as Mr. Schwartz. Indeed, the closest
thing to controversy in this year's election came when someone
found out that the candidates for president really did vote dif-
ferently from each other on at least one Separate occasion. (The
issue was that of what would the EC buy for itself for doing such
a fine job. Leland already had three letter openers; Mike, on the
other hand, wasn't sure how to open a pen knife without offend-
ing someone.)

Ah, but indications are that things will be picking up. This
year, for example, only one candidate ran unopposed. He actu-
ally lost to a write-in candidate, but the EC ruled the candidate
ineligible because he couldn't spell “EC” correctly, He was a
graduate of VMI, anyway.

Several candidates have already announced their intentions
to run for senior EC positions, even though the losers in the Big
fo have the inside edge for those offices. Among the candi-

8:

B'nai B'rith meetings; cut the price of a — of ae, ns

Lacrosse Generals take two, drop one

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

If last week was any indica-
tion, Washington and Lee’s 1975
lacrosse season could provide a
few extra heart palpitations for
even the most sedate of the Gen-
erals’ fans.

Forced to play at, of all places,
Virginia’s Scott Stadium due to
the unvlayable condition of Wil-
son Ficld, the Generals needed
a four-goal rally late in the game
to beaut Connecticut, 9-7, on
Tuesday, then turned around the
next day to waltz to a 23-2 win
over Duke.

W&L then said goodbye again
to the offense in dropping a 9-6
verdict to perennial club power
Mount Washington in Baltimore
on Saturday.

It was three different W&L
teams at each of the games.
Against Connecticut the Generals
again showed the hesitation that
might have been the fatal factor

Rainy weather
disrupts W&L
game schedules

The weather played havoe with
Washington and Lee's spring
athletic teams last week, forcing
several postponements and can-
cellations as well as the moving
of two home lacrosse games to
the Astroturf-equipped Scott
Stadium in Charlottesville.

Rain, snow, and the resulting
wet grounds prevented the W&L
baseball and golf teams from
seeing any action. The baseball
team saw three games washed
out, while the golfers’ first match
in Virginia Beach, scheduled for
Friday, was also postponed.

With the exception of the la-
crosse team, only W&L’s tennis
squad played last week, The net-
ters split a pair of matches, beat-
ing Haverford College, 9-0, while
falling to Dartmouth, 7-2.

Sophomore Jim Fisher main-
tained a perfect 3-0 record with

wins in both of his singles
matches last week. Freshman Ben
Jones joined Fisher as W&L’'s
lone winners against Dart-
mouth.

W&L's tennis record is now
2-1.

in the loss to Morgan State.
Against Duke, however, W&L let
everything loose, and the romp
that resulted almost got to be
a bore, even for the players.

At Mount Washington, the
Generals again were hampered
by an inability to find the back
of the goal, going scoreless for
almost 36 minutes in the second,
third, and early fourth quarters.

It was an inconsistancy W&L
can ill afford with what may be
the toughest week in school his-
tory facing the Generals in the
next eight days.

The week in review:

Apparently Connecticut heard
what Morgan State did to W&L
in the Generals’ season opener
and decided that they wanted to
get in on the “beat the big guy”
act.

After Donny Carroll put W&L
on the scoreboard just 15 seconds
into the game, the visitors pro-
ceeded to score four straight
goals, with attackman Jerry Har-
ris getting three of them.

The Generals then got goals
from Scott Baugher, Rob Morgan,
and Ken Miller to even the score
at 4-4 at halftime, then took a
5-4 lead on Mark Derbyshire's
tally early in the third period.

But Connecticut again stopped
W&L cold, this time scoring three
straight goals to take a 7-5 lead.
Harris got his fourth while mid-
fielder Rex Hong scored twice to
give the visitors a two-goal lead
with nine minutes left.

Unlike the Morgan State game,
however, the Generals came back
from a deficit late in the game
to pull out a win. Morgan scored
his second goal in an extra man
situation to pull W&L within one,
then Carroll got two unassisted
goals in a row to give the Gen-
erals the lead for good,

W&L then effectively stalled
out much of the remaining five
minutes until Miller picked up his
second goal with just 33 seconds
left.

* ae 6

Almost everyone except the
scorekeeper got into the act
against Duke, with 15 players
hitting the scoring column in the
23-2 romp.

After leading 3-0 in the first
quarter, the Generals exploded
for ten goals in the second period,
while the Blue Devils scored but
once.

W&L's defense broke down once
early in the third quarter to give
Duke their second goal, but then
stiffened to shut the Blue Devils
out for the last 26 minutes.

Carroll had a field day, scoring
six goals and adding four assists.
Sophomore attackman Boyd
Martin picked up five goals in
his first start, while Martin’s
classmate, midfielder Jack Dud-
ley, had four goals and an assist.

Junior Jim Englehart had a
pair of goals, while single tallis
went to Morgan, Derbyshire, Jay
Monahan, Sandy Bishop, Spenny
Neale, and Chris Larson.

Both Malcolm Hastings and
freshman Charlie Brown played
one half in the nets for W&L.
Hastings made nine saves in the
first 30 minutes while allowing
one goal, while Brown collected
six stops in the second half, giv-
ing up just one score.

a 4a oe

An offensive shutdown of 36
minutes cost the Generals any
chance for a win over club
power Mount Washington.

In fact, the final score might
have been more than 9-6 had
it not been for the goalie play of
Charlie Brown.

Brown the starting assignment,
and he responded with 22 saves,
several of the spectacular variety.

The Generals took a 2-1 lead
late in the first quarter on goals
by Scott Baugher and Charlie
Stieff. Then the Wolkpack’s de-
fense, led by former W&L All-
American Don Eavenson, stopped
the Generals cold over the sec-
ond and third quarters while
scoring seven straight goals to
take an 8-2 lead.

W&L fought back late in the
game on two goals by Dudley
and single scores by Carroll and
Bishop, but it proved to be too
little too late,

Don Krohn led Mount Wash-
ington with three goals. Two of
the Wolfpack’s goals were scored
by two more ex-All-Americans at
W&L, attackman Sam Englehart
and midfielder Skip Lichtfuss.

Now the Generals face the
toughest week on their schedule,
and for that matter, what may
be the toughest one week of
lacrosse any team in the nation
might face this year.

W&L plays three games in six
days next week against three na-
tionally-ranked teams, all of
whom regard the Generals as
THE opponent on their schedules
in the early season.

Rising midwestern power Bowl-
ing Green, undefeated last year
while earning a twelfth place
ranking in the final polls, visits

this year, and currently the num-
ber nine team in the USILA
rankings, comes to Lexington
Tuesday for a 3 p.m. game.

The week is capped by another
rematch between W&L and Navy,
still coached by former W&aL
mentor Dick Szlasa. The Gen-
erals have won the last three
meetings between the two schools,
and Friday's 3 p.m. showdown

Six swimmers travel to
NCAA meet in Penna.

Washington and Lee swim-
ming coach Bill Stearns and six
of his swimmers are at Alleghany
College in Meadville, Pa. this
weekend for the NCAA Division
III national swimming and div-
ing championships.

Heading the list is freshman
John Hudson, holder of four
state and five school records, who
will be a strong favorite in five
events—the 200-, 500- and 1650-
yard freestyles and the 400- and
800-yard freestyle relays. Hud-
son has the fastest Division III
time in the country in the 500
and 1650, and ranks second in
the 200.

W&L team captain Will Broth-
erton is entered in six events: the
50-, 100- and 200-yard freestyles,

the 100-yard butterfly, and the
two freestyle relays.

Sophomore Tad Van Leer, who
holds four W&L records, will
swim in the same events as
Brotherson except the butterfly.
Senior Dick Barber and sopho-
more Trip Wornom are entered
in the 50- and 100-yard free-
styles and the 400-yard freestyle
relay, while junior Bill Tiers will
swim in the 200-freestyle and
800-relay.

Exceptional performances at
Alleghany not only will mean
All-American status for W&L’'s
swimmers but will qualify them
for the NCAA Division I meet the
next weekend at Cleveland State
University.

originally had a scheduled com-

are now seven months off that
schedule.

There is a substantial penalty
clause written into the contract,
with financial compensation ac-
cruing to the benefit of the owner
as of August 31, 1974. Thus, hav-
ing legal recourse to seek relief,
W&L could possibly sue in court
for ill will and monetary losses
sustained by the University,
particularly if the apartments
are not completed in time for
the coming Fall Term.

Mohler appears upset by the
possibility of having to inform
students during the summer that
their living quarters will not be
ready. “We have needed these
new apartments so badly for so
long—it’s really sad that they
might not be ready. We will keep

‘cold feet’ or if the units are
not completed by September. But
here we are again, in virtually
the same situation as last year.
We had done full assignments
then, and had to go back and
tell everyone to look elsewhere,”

Although placing more con-
fidence in the May 1 target date,
Parsons still worries about the
students’ attitudes toward the
whole drawn-out affair. ‘The
University’s main concern is that
we are forced to present these
apartments to the student with
a condition of uncertainty that
we don’t like. It is not our desire
to offer these units under such
a cloud of uncertainty.”

And a cloud of uncertainty it
is, as the apartments slowly take
shape down by Wood’s Creek,
and as students cross the foot-
bridge and wonder if the hous-
ing project will be completed by
Labor Day.

Student Curriculum Committee’s survey results given

The results of the Student Cur-
riculum Committee's 1974 fall
term survey, rating the courses,
examinations, and teachers of
W&L, has just been released. Ac-
cording to Lawrence Lyles,
chairman of the committee, the
whole effort has been extremely
successfuly, owing particularly to
the overall cooperation of the
students and faculty.

Since instigating the survey
last year, the curriculum com-
mittee has incorporated several
changes in the survey itself. For
example, the evaluation of the
courses based on student answers
to pertinent questions have been
tabulated on a four-point scale
(A-four), in order for students
and faculty to interpret the re-
sults more accurately. In addi-
tion, department averages as well
as averages for the university
have been added to the computa-
tions.

“Every effort has been made to
insure the accuracy of these re-
sults,” stated Lyles, “and I hope

that faculty and students alike
will find this report informative
and useful.” Furthermore, Lyles
emphasized that the results of
the first surveys, conducted dur-
ing the 1973-74 school year, were
extremely helpful and they mani-
festly showed that the students
and faculty are interested in sur-
veys of this type.

In rating the overall depart-
ments, the Physics, Math, and
Journalism departments received
the lowest ratings, while the
Spanish, History, and German
departments received the highest
ratings. In addition, the average
for the university was favorable,
and student ratings overall rang-

The preceding changes were
made after careful consideration

feel that they will significantly
improve administration of the
Honor System. These changes go
into effect at 12:01 a.m., March
