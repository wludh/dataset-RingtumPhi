OUTLOOK andREVIEW

3

Roadimental
Existence

In the immediate past it has been our policy to address
ourselves to issues of immediate and unceasing concern to the
W&L student. We have endorsed apathy, swilling and ay
form of indulgence which tends to keep young men happy and
healthy. These endorsements have, for the most part, been of
a generalized nature, not dealing with specific proposals or
recommendations—except in wishing the Executive Commit-
tee a good banquet this year.

Perhaps it is time to address those who require concrete
suggestions in order to understand the scope of these argu-
ments fully, There is undoubtably a large and inaudible group
of students which is so apathetic that it can hardly stir itself
to think of something trivial to wile away the hours. To
these fine lumps of lethargy we say “congratuations” for your
non-accomplishment but would hazard an opinion in saying
that you are probably overdoing the apathy routine, The only
reason to be apathetic about what the rest of the world
considers important is that this allows one more time for
pleasure. It is to this group which practices lethargy even
to the exclusion of gross indulgence, i.e. about 22% of all
students and 96.7% of the administration, that we here would
like to draw some comparisons between different means of
gratifying oneself.

The list of sins for which W&L men have traditionally
shown extraordinary talent is so extensive that it has yet to
be completed (which is surprising in view of the fact that it
was begun before speech replaced sign language.) However,
students here have always been particularly adept at enter-
taining young ladies “down the road” at hot spots like West-
ern State, Eastern Mennonite, Amherst County High School
and Xavier Hollander’s School for Unclaimed Girls.

As there are many different campuses (or camp!) for
W&L men to haunt besides their own, so also are there
several types of road trips open to the willing student. Road
trips may be made at any and every time that the student
so inclined is not too hung from the night before to rouse
himself to the challenge.

All road trips fall into one of two catagories : Mid-Week
Road or Weekend Road, Of these options the first is perhaps
the more widely practiced. Gentlemen find the pleasures of
academia in many cases a sad second for a Wednesday “hump
night” road trip. This type is well known to most and follows
4 standard format—down the road with some friends, swill
in a big way, get none, chased by Pinkertons, and left by
“friends” to spend the night on alien soil, We have always
heen led to believe that a church is one of the better spots
for the one-night visit.

A somewhat inferior substitute for weekday road is week-
end road. Students visit the same old places, or sometimes
even steer their courses for as far away as C’ville or Farm-
ville. We have been doing something of a comparative study
of Weekend Road and Weekday Road in the past few weeks,
and have found the first to be infinitely weaker than the
second,

in our quest for a full understanding of the two phe-
nomenon in question we visited the campuses of U, of Va.
and Hampden-Sydney on successive weekends, We went to
U.Va. with a Hollins date; we made the trip to H-S with half
a date of unknown origin. Both visits were made on what
were supposedly “party” weekends, From what can be re-
membered of these two occasions, the schools in question
were not singularly impressive or impressed,

Girls’ schools are for the most part deserted on the w eek-
ends: it takes a bold man to go down to Macon on a Satur-
day night without having given the lady he intends to call
any prior notice, or at least contacting the dating service
provided by the Pinkertons in cooperation with the Lyneh-
burg kennels.

Times and tastes may have changed but the basics like
Swiss burgers, snow juice, gaping and going down the road
between Monday and Friday remain as the very foundations
of our civilization. Perhaps in a future era when man has
evolved to a more perfect state the road will instinctively
come to him, Until that comes to pass it will continue to be
necessary for W&I. men to seek out the road and its all too
unreliable pleasures or be left with only one viable alterna-

tive—sleep.

America, take heart. Deep in
ithe federal bureaucracy there
thrives a bureaucrat who has a
sense of humor. Believe it or not.

Not long ago, it seems, a bu-
reaucrat of a different stripe—a
toiler in the vineyard of academe,
Frank Parsons, assistant to Presi-
dent Huntley, which in part
means form«preparer—was work-
ing on an endlessly long applica-
tion for funds to be used in ‘build-
ing W&L’'s proposed new library.

The form demanded answers to
thousands of questions, it seemed,
and a few of them were even
sensible. But as it went on, it
began to resemble an adventure
in the Twilight Zone.

For instance: “Describe and
quantify, where possible, ‘how
your proposed action”—building
a library—“may affect energy
sources by introducing or delet-
ing electro-magnetic wave sources
which may alter man-made or
natural structures or the physi-
ology, behavier patterns, and/or
activities of 10 ‘per cent a
human, animal or plant popula-
tion.”

And ditto for sub-surface drain-
age, changes in wind patterns,
creation of “sounds which dis-
rupt delivery of services,” in-
terruption of services to the aged

and infirm—literally everything
Health, Edueation and Welfare,
the nation’s most skilled bureau-
cracy, could think of,

Eventually Parsons came to the
section on animal populations, To
what exent, HEW wanted to
know, would the proposed library
“oreate or ipercipitate an identifi-
able long-term change in the di-
versity of species within its na-
tural habitat?”

That did it. Parsons, who says
ihe looks on his job of filling out
federal applications as ‘penance
for past and future sins, replied:

“Phere are some 10 to 20 squir-
rels living, or appearing to live,
in the site proposed for the new
library. Some trees that now pro-
vide either homes or exercise
areas for the squirrels will be
removed, ‘but there appear to be
ample other trees to serve either
or both of these purposes. No
major food source for the squir-
rels will be affected.

“It is likely that the squirrels
will find no difficulty in adjust-
ing to this intrusion into space
heretofore their domain. They
have ‘had no apparent difficulty
in adjusting to — relocations
brought on by non-federally sup-
ported projects.

“The squirries are the most
visible inhabitants of the site;

Thursday, October 24, 1974

there are occasional sightings of
rabbits, skunks and snakes. No
effort has been made to date to
determine whether these are resi-
dent or transients. Some birds
nest in trees that will be remov-
ed, but as noted earlier, there is
no seareity of other, equally suit-
able trees that will remain.

“Inseet population is normal. .”

The feds pressed on relentless-
ly. “To what exent,” HEW asked
next, “will your proposal create
or precipitate an identifiable
change in the behavior patterns of
an animal population?”

Parsons’ reply: “As noted
above, the squirrels will have to
make some adjustments. They are
generally friendly now, ranging
somewhere between the appro-
achability of your general ‘capi-
‘tol square’ type of squirrel en-
tirely dependent on ‘human hand-
outs and those skittish ones com-
pletely wild. They appear to ac-
cept students and others about,
but none has ever been seen ac-
cepting food from a human’s
hand,

“It will ibe difficult to tell if
‘they're unhappy about having to
find new ‘trees ‘to live in and
sport about. Otherwise no change
in their behavior pattern is an-
ticipated.”

And HEW; “To what exent will

Letters to the editor...

Response to Flesher

editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

The last time I was exhorted
to go out and support my team
was senior year in high school.
And, even, then, the team during
my senior year in high schoo!
posted a 7-1 mark during the
football season.

I am somewhat short of words
to describe the feeling which
your sports editor left with me
after I read said exhortation in
last week's Ring-tum Phi, The
last time I was so asked to lend
support to a team, that support
was in the form of a standing
ovation, ordered by our athletic
director of our high school. He
merely told us to stand up and
give the team a standing ovation.

The effect is the same in both
instances. Any support shown be-
cause of an exhortation to show
support is no support at all.

A team worthy of support
earns it. This is not to say that
the Washington and Lee foothal!
team does not work hard to-
ward its achievement of an 0-5-1
season; I'm sure it does. Yet, |
am equally sure that participants
in other extra-curricular activi-
ties work just as hard. I am
speaking of the members of the
Student Activities Board (well,
again, some of them anyway),
and even some of the members
of the Phi staff.

The question, then, is: why
should we go out and rah-rah-
rah it for the football team? It
is certainly not because of the
amount of work put into the
game by its players; that work
ix easily matched by the acconyp-
lishments of many other persons
involved in many other activities
on campus, And, it is certainly
not because football is the only
sport around here. Indeed, even
the blessed pages of the Phi shun
some sports as we, the W&L com-

munity members, shun football,
Why not be so damned enthusi-
astic and reh-rah-rahish about
cros-country and soccer?

And, it is certainly not be-
cause of the team’s record,

The point is that many persons
in the W&L student body, inelud-
ing a number of football players,
came here because of the sup-
posed non-emphasis on sports
here. | know I did. I came here
because sports was a simple thing,
not a conyputer-oriented creation
of a multi-million dollar athletic
department. I came here for an
education; | could have gone to

Urchins in Cockpit
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

A state of emergency exists in
the University Center building.
Numerous complaints have been
turned in concerning children
from the age of seven to thirteen
roaming the building. Some of
the complaints are:

1) Loud noise which disturbs
students when they are studying.

2) Destruction of furniture in
Fairfax Lounge and the dining
room lounge.

3) Destruction of machines in
the same room.

1) Excessive noise in the halls
immediately outside the TV room
as students try to watch TV.

5) Playing games, e.g. chase,
in the TV room while students
are trying to wateh the TV.

6) Playing games and wrestl-
ing in the Cockpit.

7) Noise which disturbs stu
demt meetings, e.g. KC,

8) Obscene language.

HEW learns of W&L squirrels |

your (proposal bring about an
identifiable genetic change with-
in an animal population or po-
tential capacity to create a genetic
change in animal populations?”

Parsons: “The library would ap-
pear to have no capacity for af-
fecting the squirrels’ or other
animals’ genes.”

The application was duly ship-
ped off, and ultimately reached
the Division of Training and Faci-
lities, Bureau of Post-Secondary
Education, Office of Education,
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, Washington, D.C.

And somebody ‘there actually
read it. Next thing Washington
and Lee knew, the director of
that formidably named agency
dispatched a letter to the presi-
dent of ithe university demonstrat-
ing that not every federal func-
tionary is sullen and humorless:

“Occasionally,” wrote Richard
R. Holden, “bureaucrats like my-
self feel we have minimized red
tape and simplified application
forms to the nth degree . .
Fortunately, we meet our match
from time to time...

“Perhaps bureaucracy — will
tremble, but | salute Washington
and Lee University The
Mountain of ‘paperwork which
confronts me daily somehow
seemed much smatler the day f
read about the squirrels in Lex-
ington. May they and your great
university co-exist in harmony
for many, many years.”

Zevox copies of what came to
be known as the “squirrel memo”
began to find their way all
through the HEW web. Federal
bureaucrats from everywhere
found excuses to telephone the
“squirrel memo man” and con-
gratulate him on beating them
at their own game. There were
almost enough calls and letters,
in fact, to keep Parsons from fill-
ing out other federal forms for
a week or two.

Which, come to think of it,
would probably have suited the
bureaucracy just fine.

Winner snared a 46-pound 3-year-old kid to win that event).

Indeed, besides these great events, there was little for the
typical W&L man to enjoy. There was the footbal! game, which is

In trying to find out what happened that weekend, we talked

“I's Student Activities Board, idiot, not Students’ Activity Board "
He then sat back in his leather chair in his office high atop the
University Center and muttered something about why SABU
has to have almost the same initials as SAB. It appeared to this

WeéeL hosts tourney

Defending champion University
of Richmond is favored to win
the fourth annual Virginia Inter-
collegiate Water Polo Champion-
ships ‘this weekend at the Wash-
ington and Lee University pool.

The Spiders have four return-
ing All-State players and are
bolstered by several strong fresh-
men. Richmond is coached by
Hungarian National player Alex
Szilassy.

Washington and Lee, undefeat-
ed in three early scrimmages
against VMI, Virginia Common-
wealth and Lynchburg, is seeded
second in the tournament. Coach
Bill Stearns’ Generals have fin-
ished as the runner-up team for
the past three years.

Seeded, in order, behind Rich-
mond and W&L are the Rich-
mond ‘B’ team, VMI, VCU, Lynch-
burg, Old Dominion and either
the VMI or W&L ‘B’ teams. The
last two will play Thursday
afternoon to determine — the
eighth place seed.

W&L will be

Fall I-Ms
wind down

to playoffs

Intramural Fall sports are
winding down with the finals in
Golf, Tennis and Football held
this week. In I-M Golf, the SAE’s
made the finals. They were led
all season long by the deadly
shooting of George McChesney, a
senior, and Hux Brown, who aver-
aged below 40 for nine ‘holes. In
the semis Brown shot 37 in de-
feating PKPsi.

In I-M Tennis, PDT and Law 2
squared off in the finals. The Phi
Delts beat a good LCA team in
the semis 2-1. They were led by
John Friesner in the singles and
Kenny Mendelson and ‘had
Grundy in the doubles. For the
Law School, Tom Schmutz has
been the big gun all year, going
undefeated. In three macthes
against the very best that fra-
ternities had to offer, he allowed
only 5 games, while winning 30.

I-M Football has been exciting
and competitive throughout the
season. Delta Tau Delta gained

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

Over ithe past year or so, Wash-
ington and Lee has learned that
offense is THE name of the game
at Towson State.

In January Verne Canfield’s
basketball Generals saw a fast-
breaking Tiger five “shoot the
eyes out of it” to rally for a one-
point win.

And who can forget last year’s
classic lacrosse battle, which saw
Towson literally score at will
throughout the game, only to have
a frantic W&iL rally thwart the
Tigers’ wpset bid.

Now add the Generals’ footbal!
team to ‘the hist as a victim of
a Niger point barrage.

Led by the pinpoint passing of
Dan Dullen, Towson State rolled
up 653 offensive yards in waltz-
ing to a 63-16 Homecoming win
over W&L, who, in a direct turn-
about from the Hampden-Sydney
game, were basically helpless to
step the Tigers’ explosive offense.

Dullea, who entered the game
as the fourth leading passer in
the NCAA, Division TII, did
nothing to hurt his ranking as he
devastated the General secondary
with 19 of 26 completions for 344
yards and three touchdowns.

Split end Pat Barrett, who had
seven receptions for 139 yards,
hauled in scoring aerials of seven
and 66 yards, while Dullea’s third
scoring strike was a 6l-yard
screen pass to fullback K. P.
Dovie. Late in the game reserve
quarterback Scott O’Brien added
a fourth touchdown through the
air when he found Gary Worm-
ersley in the end zone with a 16-
vard pass.

The other five Tiger touch-
downs came out of the backfield,

down, finding Moore in the end
zone on a fourth-and-goal play
from the Tiger 8. The same duo
teamed for a two-pointer to make
the score 56-16, Late in the game

been missing against Hampden- <6 oe .
Sydney by picking up 337 yards.
Drives of 80 and 73 yards re-
sulted in the Generals’ touch-
downs, the first a 12-yard pass
from Jack Berry to Tony Perry;
the second an eight-yarder from
freshman Don Smith to class-
mate John Moore. W&L added
their conversions on passes from
Berry to Mark George and from
Smith to Moore.

Both Berry and Smith had good
passing days. The junior co-cap-
tain connected on 11 of 24 for
150 yards, while the freshman
signal-caller hit six of nine passes
for 86 yards. Perry led the re-
ceiving comps with seven catches
for 113 yards, while Moore caught
four passes for 60 yards.

came on a two-point conversian
pass from Dullea to Barnett, four
PAT kicks, and a 30-yard field
goal by Terry O’Brien. In all, the
Tigers put points on the board

This week the emphasis may
again ‘be on defense as the people
from the mountain, the Sewanee
Tigers invade Lexington for a

1:30 battle.

The Tigers scored on four
straight possessions in the first
and second quarters to take a
25-0 lead. The Tigers defense set
all the scores up by twice re-
covering W&L fumbles, and twice
ablowing the Generals to move
nowhere on offense.

Then came the 80-yard W&L
scoring march, in which Berry
threw five of six passes, the last
one to Perry for the touchdown.
The Berry-to-George pass closed
the gap to 25-8.

However that was as Close as
the Generals got all day. Towson
State added 11 more points be-
fore intermission on ‘the 66-yard

Dullea-to-Barrett pass, the two-

Towson - 63, Generals - 16

The Tigers, 2-3 on the year,
have won their last two starts
by whitewashing Austin (5-0)
and Southwestern (7-0). Sewanee

has also lost two shutouts to

Indiana Central (13-0) and Hamp-
den-Sydney (15-0). The Tigers’
other defeat was at the hands of
Centre, 19-14.

The game, to be played at
Wilson Field, will feature the re-
newal of the rivalry between
Sewanee head coach Shirley Ma-

jors and Generals’ defense men-

tor Boyd Williams, neither of
whom are the closest of allies.
