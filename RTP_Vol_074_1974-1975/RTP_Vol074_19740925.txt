Cabbages and kings:
Who can tell the difference?

Washington and lee faces no serious problems at present,
or at least not for the next ten seconds, The school is sound
academically and even sounder socially, Everybody is having
a good time—or could if they wanted to badly enough,

What is it, then, that has kept W&L on an even plane,
that has kept us from becoming another mediocre school
with no personality? The answer is ineredibly simple and
something always overlooked by those who take the time to

look for answers: apathy.

W&L students, for the most part, could not care less
about what HEW is doing to improve or wreck their world.

Let the YR’s and the Birchers worry about that. Student
activism is a disease which has disappeared after its merci-
fully short appearance in the late sixties, After all, gentle-

men have more important things to occupy that sadly limited
period of bliss, their youth,

To begin with, men here have an unsurpassed sense of
proportion. That is to say, they are well-rounded. What W&L
ventleman would allow mere academics to interfere with
road trips or Sunday afternoon parties? For the unquestion-
ably small minority that does not know how to be so frivolous
we can only offer our deepest condolences and pity; you
might as well be jacketed in Western State or playing
pinochle in the Twilight Nursing Home if you are already

starting to take life in earnest.

Everything about life here encourages complete and single-
minded triviality. Lexington cannot be taken seriously by
anybody. Even the city fathers admit this by implication
when they spend their tine figuring out places to put sense
less one-way streets and dreaming about Mel's return with
Hollywood crews, All around us is quaint and picturesque,
VMI looks like a fine old medieval castle (though not so
romantic for those enrolled) and does tend to keep its cadets
occupied with such essential concerns as polishing shoes and
rubbing brass. For those who want vocational training in

these fields it is only steps away.

W&l protects us from the mundane world—not that we

are incapable of handling that—but who really gives a damn
about learning about income-tax returns and having to go
to the office? Let the faculty worry about that. For students

here life is rather idyllic,

However, anything as precious and fragile as our en-
vironment can be irreparably shattered all too easily. If we
want to interrupt our purpose here we have only to question
it in the same way the sociology department questions all
ocial patterns. Why should W&L teach us how to compete

society and we should be proud, Out there they have more far-

Washington Hall keep us on good terms with surrounding
virls’ schools, which is the only constructive thing they could

wssibly accomplish anyway.

Fraternities are no longer stereotyped and this is indeed

unsettling. In this day and time we have no choice but to

DEAR TRAVELLER—Wateching last week's football game, I have
come to realize that Washington and Lee is not what one would call
a jock school, despite the requirement that everyone take at least
five physical education classes. However, | have heard rumors that
W&L has a sports history of which it can boast, The facts, please.
(Signed) H. Cosell

WEL is
prides

unfounded,
particularly

DEAR SPORTS FAN—Those rumors are not
steeped in sports tradition, and the university
itself on its many sports records. Among them:

—The football team’s incredible string of 123 games without a
shower, 1923-39. The string was broken Oct. 3, 1989 when the team’s
star tackle, 596-pound Marv Fritters, slipped and fell off the foot-
bridge into the river below, drenching not only the entire team but
the campus as well. Many drips can still be seen around campus.

—The 1947 football game against Sweet Briar. Due to a specia
ruling, both teams agreed to play overtime until somebody won.
With 8:52 left in the 21st period, Sweet Briar finally had to call it
quits to get back to the campus in time for 9 p.m, curfew, Hight
plays later the Generals recovered a fumble and scored to win the
game.

—Harry “Simp” Wendleton in 1957 picked off a record 13  base-

runners in a baseball game from his catcher position. Wendleton
was later convicted on 13 murder charges.
—iIn 1954. LaVerne “Stretch” Darwinger scored a school record

18 technical fouls in a game against Randolph-Macon (the record
books do not say whether it was Randy-Mac’s male or female team.)
Darwinger reportedly was ejected from the game after he repeatedly
asked the referee if her (Darwinger) could tie the shoelaces of all
the players on the court. Dadwinger said it was for extra credit
in a weaving course he was failing. Darwinger was the last W&L

student on scholarship at the school, or at least the last one the
school will admit to.
—In 1965, Herbie “Flash” Windjammer set a school and appar-

ently world record in the 100 yard dash with a :064 time. Wind-
jammer was aided in his run by the fact that he was being chased

at the time by Bertha Berwanger, who had just won Southern
Seminary’s birth defect look-alike contest. Windjammer never did
stop.

Madison sustains lead, #*

W&L rally thwarted

Sports Kditor

A little bit of everything went
into Washington and Lee’s home
football opener Saturday, but the
end result was the toughest loss
of what is now a nine-game los-
ing streak,

Trailing Madison 24-14 with six
minutes left, the Generals staged
a furious rally to reach the door-
step of vietory—only to have
Ralph Moore’s 27-yard field goal
attempt with :56 left miss by
inches to give the Dukes a 24-22
win in their first varsity game.

A Wilson Field crowd of almost
4,000—many of whom missed the
frantic fourth quarter, when they
opted for the comfort of their
dry living quarters rather than
get a bit wet — saw a wide
open affair in which the two
teams collected 49 first downs,
threw the ball 63 times, and gain-
ed 787 total offensive yards.

Yet it was the alert play of
the defensive units that made the
difference. Of nine turnovers
forced by both defenses, three led
to touchdowns, including the
Dukes’ final six-pointer.

After Madison’s Bob Ward put
the visitors ahead 17-14 with a
27-vard field goal, the Dukes’
Rich Jackson set up the winning
touchdown when he intercepted
a Jack Berry pass and return-
ed it to the W&L 14. Two plays
later, Ron Stith scored from one
yard out to up the lead to 24-14,

But W&L came right back as
Berry engineered a 10-play, 67-
yard scoring drive, throwing to
freshman Eamon Cassell for the
final four yards with 3:03 left.
A Berry pass to Mercer West
earned the two-point conversion,
cutting the Dukes’ lead to 24-22.

A W&L onside kick attempt
then failed. But on the next play,
Stith fumbled. The ball bounced
crazily in the Madison backfield
for several seconds until fresh-
man cornerback Charlie Brown
recovered on the Dukes 27. Four
plays later W&L had moved down
to the 10, but then Berry missed
passes on second and third down.

So, on fourth and six, head
coach Bill McHenry called on
Moore for a field goal attempt

from the 17, The kick easily had
the distance, but stayed just
inches outside the right upright,
and the Generals found them-
selves on the short end of the
final verdict,

The game began the same of-
fensive note that it ended on.
After taking the opening kickoff
W&L marched to the Madison
12, where a drive fizzled when
Berry was sacked on fourth and
l4. Then the Dukes stormed 69
yards in nine plays with Bernard
Slayton, who gained 106 yards in
19 carries, going the final eight
for the touchdown. Ward's kick
made it 7-0,

But the Generals tied the game

  

Moore’s kick got through despite
being deflected, and it was 7-7.

Wé&L grabbed their only lead
on the first play of the second
quarter, When Berry rolled a-
round right end for a two yard
touchdown, The score had been
set up four plays earlier when co-
captain Steve VanAmburgh re-
covered a Slayton fumble on the
Madison 13. Moore added the
extra point to make it 14-7,

But the Dukes almost immedi-
ately scored to tie it at 14-14,
when quarterback Leslie Branich
hit Tom Rabinson with a 25-yard
scoring pass.

There the scoring ended until

the wild and woolly fourth period.
In the meantime it was the de-
fenses who dominated.

Between the touchdown pass
to Robinson and the Ward field
goal, Madison moved inside the
W&L 25 five times, only to come
up empty on each occasion, Three
times the Dukes reached the Gen-
erals’ 3, but a missed field goal
by Ward, an interception by
Brown, and a quarterback sack

by Rick Kulp, who now plays
defense only in goalline situa-
tions, thwarted each _ threat.

Meanwhile the Madison defense

held W&lL to only 382. third
quarter yards,
McHenry saw some bright

spots despite the final outcome.

“I’m very pleased with the im-
provement in our running game,”
MeHenry noted. W&L picked up
99 yards on the graund against
Madison, in contrast to the minus
26 yards rushing against Millers-
ville State. Junior running back
Rob Lindsey was the workhorse,
picking up 81 yards in 20 carries.

Again the passing game was
a bright spot, as Berry completed
23 of 39 aerials for 231 yards.
Mark George grabbed nine of
those for 103 yards, Tony Perry
added six catches for 64 yards,
and Cassell chipped in with five
catches for 43 yards and two
touchdowns.

McHenry credited defensive
linemen Warren Wolfe and John
Markley, linebacker Rob Muc-
ciola, and cornerback Brown for
their defensive play, but called
the overall defensive effort “in-
consistant.”

tennis and football, And, as usual,
there are many preseason fa-

In tennis the Faculty looks for

Competition could come from any
of the other teams entered in the
