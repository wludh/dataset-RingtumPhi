Socialists’ star is rising

By TESS REEVES
Minister of Propaganda

You may think that things do
not ¢:.nge much around W&L,
but tuat is far from true. The
latest earth-shaking occurence
in this area took place last week
as the campus was invaded by
the Young Socialist Alliance.

This potent political entity
appeared last Thursday when a
table was set up in front of the
Co-op displaying the group’s
literature and miscellaneous
propaganda, The Young Social-
ist Alliance (YSA) held a meet-
ing on Friday afternoon in the

underground, which was attended

organizations nth political
orientations existed on campus,
e.g., the Young Republicans, the
Young Democrats, and the Young
Americans for Freedom. All of
these are to some extent con-
servative factions, but the void
on the left has now been filled
by the YSA which currently
boasts 15 names on their mailing
list.

  
 

Contact announces

By STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

The co-chairmen of Contact
are extremely pleased with the
results of this year’s program
are working to reschedule James
Kilpatrick’s talk, and have an-
nounced a special speaker for
a presentation during the Spring
‘Term.

It is hoped that Kilpatrick will
be able to appear on campus be-
fore the end of this term. He was
not able to present his lecture
this past Monday night because
he contracted the flu, and was
too ill to travel in the snow.

chairmen Ben Sherman and Bob

all, a man to whom many con-
tributed money last year to aid
him in his endeavors, a man
well-known at many universities
and a demi-god here in town. He
is Jack Emmer, head lacrosse

extra lecture

the Spring Break road trip, and
future prospects for the team.

For those who schedule their
social events weeks in advance,
Emmer will present his talk on
April 16, the first Wednesday
after Spring break.

In discussing the main portion
of Contact, Ben Sherman noted
that he was pleased with the
overall attendance, taking into
receount the somewhat limited
appeal of this year's program.
This year Contact dealt with
problems in the American legal,
political, economic and industrial
systems, with Kilpatrick's lecture
to be on the mass media. Some
of those who delivered addresses

this year were relatively un-
known to the average student,
and the program itself con-
flicted with mid-term tests in
some instances.

This year's program, on a
higher intellectual plane than

some previous Contacts, received
high praise from President Hunt-
ley. He has said that this Contact
was by far the best he has seen
since he became head of the uni-
versity in 1968,

The participants themselves
thoroughly enjoyed their visits to
WA&L. T. Justin Moore, president
of VEPCo, has written to the
Contact committee that VEPCo
was extremely pleased with the
between Moore and en-
vironmental activist David
Brower, and that it just might
encouraging more of its

debate

McCullough, Glover

win in EC elections

3y JOK FITZGERALD
Leland McCullough, Mynders
Glover and Sandy Stradtman
have won elections to the posts
of President, Vice-President and

Secretary, respectively, of the
student body.
McCullough defeated Mike

Luttig by a margin of 508 to
356 with 28 write-ins. Glover re-
ceived 477 votes to defeat Ted
Reeds, who had 325. There were
20 write-ins. Stradtman, who
was unopposed for Secretary, got
621 votes. There were 47 write-in
votes in that race.

The candidates had little com-
ment on the outcome of the
elections. Leland McCullough
said only, “It’s good to have all
that stuff over with.” Ted Reeds,
referring to his loss, said, “I
guess I know how it feels now.”
Mynders Glover, when asked if
he wanted to make any comment,
replied, “Not particularly.”

Also in regard to elections, the
Executive Committee announced
Monday night that petitions for
class officers and class E.C.
representatives are due in the
E.C. room by 7 p.m. Monday
night.

Petitions must be signed by 50
students. Each class will elect
a president and two E.C. repre-
sentatives. The rising sophomore
and junior classes will elect one
vice-president. The rising seniors
will elect three vice-presidents,
one each from arts, science and
commerce.

Later Monday evening, after
tallying election votes, the Ex-
ecutive Committee took its own
final vote on all Honor System
changes made in the last month.
The E.C. also voted, 11-1 with
Mike Luttig opposed, that the
changes will go into effect at
midnight on March 23.

Luttig was opposed to the sud-
den implementation of the
changes on the grounds that it
does not leave time enough to
orient the students. Elliot Hicks
and Steve Robinson proposed
that the changes take effect im-
mediately.

The E.C. also took a first vote
on erammatical corrections made
in the White Book by Everett
Martin and Bob Pugh. The final
vote on those changes will come
next week,

In other business, the E.C.
heard from Jerry Darrell dining
ing hall manager, and Paul Malin,
hall manager, and Paul Malin
Pat Brennan, and Jim Haines,
student checkers in the dining

without paying and get food for
other persons in the dining hall.

The dining hall delegation re-
ported on students not paying
for meals, using someone else's
contract card, getting food and
drinks for dates and generally
making life tough for the check-
ers.

According to Malin, “Students
are no longer supporting the
Honor System in the dining hall.”

The E.C. decided to send two
or three of its members to watch
the lines during meals so they
may become more familiar with
the problems in hopes of doing
something about them.

The E.C. will also be passing
out a questionnaire telling stu-
dents the alternatives for con-
trol of the dining hall and ask-
ing them which they prefer.

The E.C. heard a report from
Lawrence Lyles of the Curricu-
lum Committee. Lyles reported
that the class survey conducted
during the Fall term is now
completed and should be avail-
able soon. He said only a hand-
ful of professors did not use the
forms last term, and he predict-
ed an easy job for next year’s
Curriculum Committee chairman.

Lyles also reported that the
class survey for the Winter term
will be conducted next week.

Mock Convention seeks

4 regional coordinators

By The Phi News Staff

The 1976 Mock Convention
Steering Committee is now tak-
ing applications for the positions
of Eastern, Southern, Western
and Mid-Western regional co-
ordinators. These four people,
along with the credentials chair-
man, will comprise the Credent-
ials Committee for the 1976
Mock Convention. This com-
mittee monitors the progress of
state delegations in research,
fund-raising, and other duties,
and assists each delegation in
every way possible. More specific-
ally, each coordinator is required
to develop a knowledge of his
region’s political scene, while an
administrative assistant (again,
one for each region) handles the
bulk of the work.

As only 45% of the real con-
vention delegates are chosen be-
fore the W&L convention, the job
of the regional coordinator, that
of insuring the validity of delega-
tion votes on the first and subse-
quent ballots, becomes one of the
most crucial during the conven-
tion.

Applications are available in
the University Center (in Ken
Lane's office) and in the Book-
store. They are due in Ken
Lane's office by 3 p.m. on Mon-
day. March 17. Interviews will
be held early the next week, and
applicants will be notified by
mail. For further information,
please contact Reed Morgan, Ken
Ruscio, or Tom Rittenburg.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Fans

Many peope have been complaining lately about the
conduct of W&L students at lacrosse games. Up until this
point we have dismissed most of these accusations as we felt

that the enthusiasm of the students was more important than a
few blown-out fans. We concluded that those who complained
were simply too sensitive and temperamental to accept the
rambunctious behavior of some students out for a good time.

Several situations brought to our attention lately have
forced us to change our opinion on this matter. A few weeks
ago we were told that two of the teams on our lacrosse
schedule had seriously considered dropping W&L from their
program owing to the problem they had had with the W&L
fans. Whether it is throwing ice, riping out seats, or explicit

language which concerns our opponents, we were almost

dropped from the programs of schools which we want and

need to play, eg., U.Va.

Recently the problem of W&L fans and their conduct
has been brought to our attention as the result of what for
us is an unfortunate situation. Even as we type this editorial,
U.Va. has offered W&L the use of their stadium to play this
week's games which might have to be cancelled if the only
alternative was playing them in the slush and mud of the
W&L fields. However, U.Va. placed one condition on their

offer: that the student body

here not be widely informed

that its team would be in Charlottesvile, This condition was
intended to keep the number of W&L fans to a minimum in

the Charottesville facilities.

As much as we hate to say it, our fans do need to cool
the act a little. We have now made ourselves unwelcome as
fans at some neighboring schools, In the process of swilling
and partying, we may be hurting our lacrosse team more than
we are helping it. We say this with caution as we do not
wish to give the impression that we fail to appreciate the

enthusiasm of the

Wé&L students, and we

know that the

athletic department would concur with us on this point. Cer-
tainly, being obnoxious does have its place at any athletic
event, On the other hand, there is such a thing as going
overboard. Please restrain yourselves from the temptation to
throw a side body-block on the wife of the President of the
University at the next lacrosse game.

Concern expressed
for inequality of rules

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi;

I am a freshman who is seri-
ously concerned with the inequ-
ality of rules stressed by this
University. Five others and I are
presently kicked out of our dorm
rooms for smoking pot. We went
in front of the Student Control
Committee for this offense. I
am not trying to justify this act,
but I believe that it's University
Policy to punish all offenders of
the law.

Therefore I believe it is only
right to punish those people who
come back from parties on the
week-ends drunk and disorderly,
making undue noise and trashing
the quad so that the janitors on
Saturday must clean up after
these morons. I can go up to my
room, smoke a joint, and I bother
no one. Yet when these children
‘and I mean children) come back
roaring drunk, they not only
bother me, but many others on
this campus. Marijuana is a
misdeanor in this state, but so
is drunk and disorderly.

Thus I believe if you punish
one violation of the law, I think
it's the University's responsibility
to punish all breaches of conduct.
I am not condoning the use of
pot, nor am I condemning the
use of alcohol, but it is only just
that if you pressure one group
with punishment you must pres-
sure all with the same.

For this University’s basis is
to make gentlemen of us all and
by avoiding these actions, it fails
to do 80.

Name withheld upon request

We can understand your con-
cern jor the apparent discrep-
aneyv, but there is a significant
reason for the different handl-
ing of these cases, Possession o/
marijuana, a misdemeanor, car-
ries with it a maximum of twelve
months imprisonment and one
thousand dollar fine, Being drunk
and disorderly in public is pun-
ishable by a maximum penalty
of ten dollars. Hardly comparable
although both are misdemeanors.

White Column Inn offers something new

By JAMES MASON
Phi Food Lditor

Deciding where to have dinner
or lunch in Lexington often pre-
sents the student with something
of a problem. He finds a large
number of establishments avail-
able to visit; Lexington does have
quantity in respect to the num-
ber of restaurants. On closer
inspection he realizes that there
is not a great deal of variety
among the many eating places.
Half the restaurants in town
specialize in Italian food and
pizza. However, one cannot live
on pasta and pepperoni alone.
The traditional Lexington altern-
ative is a greasy soy-burger and
frozen french fries—not the most
desirable of dinners.

Owing to these circumstances
on the Lexington culinary scene,
it was with considerable expecta-
tion that we awaited the open-
ing of the White Column Inn
under the managment of Mrs.
Odell McGuire. Having now
visited this new establishment
some fifteen times we can hon-
estly say that we are genuinely
pleased.

The White Column Inn offers
something old and something
new. At last Lexington has a
restaurant whose cook/owner
shows a knowledge of how food
should be handled. Mrs. Mc-
Guire treats the elements of her
cooking reverently and simply—
a concept new to Lexington, or
long forgotten, but old else-
where. She allows the many dif-
ferent types of food she serves to
retain their natural flavors; her
preparation employs seasonings
to enhance, rather than mask,
the inherent qualities of ingre-
dients.

As indicated above, the crucial
consideration in evaluating a
restaurant is the food. However,
atmosphere and service are also
important in the complete ap-
praisal. In reviewing the first
of these three elements one must
take a look at the luncheon and
dinner offerings separately and
make a few suggestions for the
aspiring gourmand.

Between noon and two p.m.,,
Tuesday through Friday, Mrs.
McGuire's bill of fare includes 2
soups, salads, and assorted sand-
wiches. The soups are consistent-
ly hearty and fresh, although
some are better than others. The
cream soups, bisques, and thick
vegetable soups with purees are
among the best offered. Especi-
ally good are the chicken gumbo,
potato and leek, cream of mush-
room, and ham and lentil. These
are very thick and rich, sub-
stantial enough to make a de-

the ham, cheese, and pineapple
is a pleasing combination sand-
wich. The salads are always crisp
and fresh and do not feature
standard Lexington wilted
greens. For a dollar or two one
can enjoy a satisfying lunch any
day.

The White Column Inn dinners,
ranging in price from $2.50 to
$4.50, are probably the best bar-
gains in Lexington. They in-
clude two specialties each eve-
ning, Wednesday through Satur-
day. The entrees of chicken are

more modest offered is Welsh
rarebit or a vegetable plate with
broccoli in Hollandaise. Every
dinner comes with onion soup
to start things off nicely and
fresh rolls a la McGuire.

Menus change on the week-
end but remain equally enjoy-
able. With Saturday lunch comes
home-made chili, which avoids
an over-abundance of either
grease or ketchup and is so much
the better for it. Brunch on Sun-
day provides either crepes or
omelettes (again, something new

idea to go either at noon or toward closing to avoid the crowd as these people have done.

lightful meal in themselves at
90 cents a bowl. Soups with thin
or clear broths include onion,
vegetable, tomato and rice, and
tomato consume, all of which are
flavorful but not excellent as are
their thicker counterparts. Sand-
wiches are also available on Mrs.
McGuire's fresh French bread or
pumpernickle; they are always
reliably enjoyable and filling.
The roast beef is generous, and

deliciously seasoned and expertly
prepared with sherried chicken
and curried chicken surpassing
thus far. Meat dishes are suc-
cessful as well, especially beef
bourgenion, sauerbraten, beef
stroganoff, and corned beef. The
Hungarian goulash is unfortu-
nately unimpressive as it ap-
proaches being simply a col-
lection of boiled vegetables in
a tasteless liquid. Something

Letters to the Editor...

Society, and probably the City
of Lexington, looks upon stu-
dents’ drinking in quite a dif-
ferent light than their use of
“obnoxious weeds.” The school is
only protecting itself and its
students by enforcing what you
may feel are somewhat strict
rules on the use of marijuana.

If the school failed to enforce
restrictions on drugs, the town
probably would, and that would
not be at all desirable for some-
one like you. Drinking by minors
or being drunk and disorderly is
something that the city authori-
ties graciously overlook unless it
is brought right under their
noses. Thus, the rules are there
only to protect you in the case
of marijuana, They do not exist
for cases concerning drinking be-
cause the same problems do not
exist here.

Freshman response

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Your critcism of the Fresh-
man grain party was an unjust
slap in the class's face. As a
matter of fact the Freshman
grain party was one of the suc-
cesses of Fancy Dress weekend:
good weather, adequate parking,
and plenty of open space to move
around in, I also was at the
party for two and a half hours
and had my cup filled every
time I went to the “trough.”

Perhaps you could have had
the initiative to hustle a few
cups of grain. At least you could
have made an effort to show up
at the party earlier, instead of
waiting to complain in your
editorial.

You did too much “back slap-
ping” in the other areas to then
turn and criticise the Freshman
party. There were other efforts
that were deficient. For example,
it was hellishly hot in the Star-
light Club Friday night. As we
all know, organization and plan-
ning take care of such matters.
The organization of the Fresh-
man party could not have been
better.

Sincerely,
Asa G. Candler, VI

Freshmen defend their

recent grain party

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

In accordance with your edi-
torial of February 27, we would
also like to compliment the stu-
dent body for their fine re-
sponse to Fancy Dress this year.
But the criticism in your state-
ment offered to the Freshmen
class officers was neither con-
structive nor concretely founded.
We regard your assertion that
“the organizers did about as
much wrong as they possibly
could have" as totally inaccurate
We daresay that the majority of
those who attended would also
disagree with it.

Your point that there was not
enough grain was entirely true,
if you consider “enough” as the
amount necessary to cause all
the party-goers to become hope-
lessly intoxicated. It would
doubtlessly take more money
than is in the coffers of every
class treasury combined to ac-
complish such a goal. The
amount of grain (35 gallons)
bought for the Fancy Dress party
was five gallons more than that
bought for the grain party spon-
sored by the Sophomore class in
the spring.

The only point after which
grain punch became “impossible
to get’ was the end of the party.
The temporary shortage of the
water needed to mix the punch
was due to the failure of the
Pavilion’s owner to return with
additional water within a
promised time period of thirty
minutes. Instead he returned in
forty-five minutes, making it im-
possible for grain to be served
for a minimal fifteen minutes,
Punch flowed freely for the re-

maining time; never did the
organizers ‘simply decide to stop
serving” or run out of grain
alcohol. Ask those who watched
us mix the punch about its being
“weak.” You'll find their answers
contrary to your allegation to
that effect.

It is easier for most of us to
condemn rather than to com-
mend; however, the comments
directed toward us by others
about the grain party were in
praise of its success, not out of
criticism of its alleged failure.
In spite of this “weak link” in
your editorial, it was “quite a
success,’ and for that, ‘we have
only (you) to thank.”

Faculty logic questioned

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to express my
extreme disappointment with the
faculty's decision not to change
the current Winter Term exam
schedule. This means that exams
will commence Monday, March
31, and end Saturday, April 5.

The decision to alter the school
calendar rests solely with the
faculty, Before their vote on the
issue last week, they had received
two recommendations to switch
the starting date to Saturday.
March 29. The first originated
with the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee, and while the second
came from the University Coun-
cil, I initiated the switch in the
U.C. for two principle reasons

The Alexander-Withrow House

3% WEST WASHINGTON STREET
A restored historic landmark with five period-furnished guest suites.
A different experience in overnight hospitality for those who love
fine things. Students may make reservations for their parents and
tour the house from 10-2 Tuesday through Saturday or write Mrs.

Harriet Thomas.

One—students under the present
exam schedule taking four exams
would not have the option of a
day between each exam. Two—
those students wishing to finish
quickly would be able to leave
earlier.

Why the majority of the
faculty elected to maintain the
present schedule is most puzzling
to me. A reliable source indicat-
ed to me that one of the main
reasons the faculty decided
against any change was the
faculty's belief that they could
not have the exams ready by
Saturday. This I find difficult
to believe. Besides the fact that
they would have had a month's
notice so as to adjust, the faculty,
earlier in the year, approved a
tentative calendar which stipu-

given at the facully meeting was
that it would be too confusing
to change the schedule. My reply
to that, baloney. A couple of
posters ought to alleviate any
potential confusion.

The faculty's logic is most baf-
fling. Exams have begun on
Saturday in the past and are
scheduled to do so in the future.
Unfortunately, one thing is clear:
this sudden deviation will bring
a good deal of inconvenience to
the student body.

That a_ faculty decision
appears illogical and even con-
tradictory is not the most sur-
prising thing we have heard
lately. Any group which allows
Friday to become Thursday
and Saturday to replace Friday
may just as easily decree that
it cannot change its schedule
by one day on such short
notice, i.e., one month in ad-
vance,

A letter to the fans

We, the captains of the 1975 W&L lacrosse team, would like
to express some of our feelings concerning student support at

We are extremely proud that the student body has en-
thusiastically supported our team these last few years. Without
you behind us we're very sure our success would have been
limited. We feel lacrosse at W&L has been a unifying force for
the entire university community and has been a source of pride
for students, faculty and alumni alike. The excitement that has
been created in 1973 and 1974 has affected our school in many
ive ways, but there have been times when your abundant
sort has created some negative reactions from within our
school and from parents, friends, prospects, and visitors.
i.ot us explain ourselves: we depend on your positive sup-

Lo be successful. We have some fond memories of situations
our Towson game a year ago when we were down by
three goals late in the game and everyone in the stands gave
us a standing and long lasting cheer. It felt great and we
subsequently made a super comeback to win in overtime. There
is no doubt in that situation that your support was of @

There are times, however, when the feedback we receive on
your actions is a negative one. We don’t think that our fans
have to stoop so low as to embarrass our opponents with
offensive language or actions. Parents, guests and prospects,
who we hope will help W&L continue its winning ways, have
at times been insulted and generally taken back by particular
fan behavior. We assume you all realize what we are referring
to and realize that some of these negative actions only tarnish
all the positive things lacrosse and student lacrosse fans have
accomplished over the last few years.

Our appeal to you, the student body, is to continue to give
us the outstanding support you've recently shown, but to keep
it in a positive form. We hope, if a small minority gets out of
hand at Wilson Field, that others will take a stand and remedy

We look forward to another great year and the excitement

Wrestling, baseball teams
have little weekend success

Washington and Lee’s baseball
and wrestling teams had little
success over the weekend.

The baseball Generals dropped
a season opening doubleheader to
Connecticut, 4-0 and 16-0, while
only one wrestler won any
matches at the NCAA-Division
Ill championships in Cleveland.

W&L could muster only three
hits in the doubleheader, while
the visitors, playing outside for
the first time this year, came
through with three home runs
and a total of 22 hits in the
doubleheader.

Senior Rod Ferrandino pitch-
ed well in his first outing, allow-
ing just five hits in the opener.
One of those, however, was a
roundtripper to Connecticut's
Mike D’Arminio.

Sophomore Dan Westbrook had

the roof fall in on him in the
nightcap, as Connecticut explod-
ed for 11 runs in the third inning.

Only senior co-captain Doug
Ford had any success at the
NCAA wrestling meet.

Ford, wrestling at 177 pounds,
won his first match by a pin
before being eliminated to the
consolation bracket by an event-
ual semi-finalist.

In the consolation bracket
Ford won two matches and came
within a match of All-American
standing before suffering an
overtime loss to a wrestler from
Luther (lowa) College, 3-0.

Three W&L wrestlers, Howard
Knipp (118), Jim Crytzer (150),
and Steve Schweizerhaf (Hvy)
all lost first round matches.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Stickmen upset in opener, 8-7

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

It had been a long time in
coming, maybe.

But for Washington and Lee
lacrosse fans, many of whom
were seeing the Generals in
action for the first time, it was
more than just a disappoint-
ment.

It was a near disaster,

What happened was that the
Generals lost a lacrosse game.
Not that such a phenomenon had
not occured before—W&L had
fallen twice in NCAA tournament
play and several times in exhibi-
tion games to club teams in 1973
and 1974.

But not once in the past two
years had the Generals lost a
regular season game.

It finally happened Saturday.

Morgan State, the same school
that was win number one for
W&L in 1973 and 1974, rose to
the occasion and played their best
game ever to beat the Generals,
8-7, in the season opener for
both teams.

The higher-than-a-kite Bears

Netters post
8-1 win in
first match

Washington and Lee’s tennis
team opened its season on a win-
ning note Saturday, downing
West Virginia, 8-1.

W&L won the match in the
Singles, as John Embree, Jim
Fisher, Buz Walters, A. O. Smith,
and Don Caffrey won their
matches.

The Generals padded their
margin when Embree teamed
with Ben Johns, Smith with
Fisher, and Walters with Caffrey
to win all three doubles matches.

W&L had its Monday match
with Haverford postponed due to
snow.

The schedule for this week:

Saturday—Dartmouth—home
at 1:00; Sunday—Dartmouth—
home at 1:00; Wednesday at
Richmond.

won the game by simply outplay-
ing W&L, something few teams
have done in recent years.

The key to Morgan State’s win
was sophomore goalie Courtenay
Servary, who put on a show by
himself, making 25 saves, several
of the unbelievable variety.

Servary’s work in the _ net
sparked Morgan State’s second
half comeback. The Bears trailed
5-2 at halftime, and with the
weather being cold and windy
as it was, many of the Wilson
Field crowd of nearly 2,000 head-
ed for warmer quarters.

But Morgan State persevered
scoring the first two goals of
the second half to cut the W&L
lead to 5-4.

W&L’s Don Carroll, who led

all scorers with four goals, then
put the Generals up by two with
his third tally of the game.

However it was the Generals’
last goal for nearly 25 minutes,
a stretch of time in which
Morgan State made their move
toward the win.

The Bears’ John Workman
scored twice near the end of the
period to knot the score at 6-6
after three quarters. Then Dave
Raymond, along with Servary an
Honorable Mention All-American
last year, got his second goal to
put the Bears ahead, 7-6.

The clincher came on a heads-
up play by Morgan State’s Mike
Walsh,

ings moved upfield for a clear-

The Generals dropped the con-
solation game the following night

W&L’'s cold shooting continued

But it was another 4:30 before

ing attempt, Walsh moved in for
a check. Suddenly the ball pop-
ped out of Hastings’ stick, Walsh
picked it up, and tossed it into
an empty net to seal the Gen-
erals’ fate.

Carroll broke W&L’s scoring
drought with 2:44 left to cut
the lead to 8-7, but several shots
late in the game were all turned
away by Servary, who seemed to
have the clutch play whenever
he needed it.

Attackman Rob Morgan joined
Carroll in leading the W&L scor-
ing with two goals and two
assists, while midfielder Ken
Miller scored the final General’s
goal.

Noticably missing from the
General’s attack was 1974 lead-
ing scorer Dave Warfield, who
watched the game from the side-
line as a result of a knee in-
jury suffered in practice.

The knee was placed in a cast
as a precautionary measure.
However no one is sure just
when Warfield might return to
action.

W&L trailed North Carolina
Methodist throughout the first
half in the consolation game,
and was down by seven, 30-23, at
halftime.

But the Generals rallied behind
Kristoff and John Podgajny to
take a 39-36 lead with 14:00 left.

Then the Monarchs put to-
gether a 15-3 spurt that gave
them the lead which they never
relinquished.

Podgajny led W&L with 17
points, while Kristoff added 15
points and 12 rebounds.

Elton Stanley had 30 points, 11
assists, and five steals for Metho-
dist.

The Generals finished the sea-
son 15-12. It was the ninth win-
ning season in a row for W&L
head coach Vern Canfield.
