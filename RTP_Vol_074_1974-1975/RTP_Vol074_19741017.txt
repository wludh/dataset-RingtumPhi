Bailey’s report summarized the

“Nonetheless, the thing I hoped
would stick in their minds,”
Bailey stated, “was the emphasis
on the honor system.” He in-

Exorcism is not unknown
to local Episcopal priest

By JOE FITZGERALD
Phi Staff Reporter

Although it may come as a
shock to many fans of William
Peter Blatty and of his creations,
exorcists and cases of possession
ave exceedingly rare, and the
overblown attention paid to such

cases is due largely to the ap-
pearance of the novel The
Exorcist, and the subsequent
nvovie.

According to Rev. D. Holmes
ving Jr. reotor of the Robert
fe. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Ohurch, the mania is “part of
the whole area of interest in

the supernatural” that exists to-
day, and is caused by a “craving
for some contact with the super-
natural.”

Rev. Irving has performed an

exorcism himself, and describes
his own experience with the rite
as “very emotional but

nothing dramatic.”

Rev. Irving's performance came
two Year's in Charlottesville
at the altar of an Episcopal
church after the request of a
pyehiatrist and the mother of the
14 year old patient. The Rev-
erend knelt at the altar and
prayed that the evil spirit in the
teenager's body be replaced by
the Spirit of God. He recounts
no fiying furniture or any of
the other strange occurrences
depicted in the William Friedkin
movie.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK,

Rush

Now that the endurance contest is over, which is to say
that rush ended last week, we feel at liberty to make a few
observations and comments on the nature of this year’s rush.

The Interfraternity Council oversees a rush which is fairly
formal in structure, Freshmen sign up to go to individual
fraternities at appointed times and are invited back if the
fraternity wants to see more of them, if the members of a
given fraternity have the presence of mind to remember this
formality. An alternative would be for the IFC to direct an
“open” rush which would be less structured and probably
less effective.

 

The system as it now stands forces the freshmen to see
many different houses on an equal footing. It does not leave
to the novice the responsibility of gleaning a fairly accurate
idea of what various fraternities are like. This somewhat
formal structure takes the initiative away from the freshman,
which is probably a good thing. Most freshmen would not
take it upon themselves to visit many fraternities or find
out what the system is all about in an “open” rush situation.

The IFC does its level best to insure that rush is as equit-
able for all fraternities as possible and in this it succeeds in
large part. Perhaps it even does too much, Many fraternities
and freshmen felt that this year’s rush was too long. By the
fourth week of rush many were ready to call it a day
and had felt that way for almost a week. This is shown by
the fact that the IFC bowed to peer pressure and relaxed
its regulations towards the end, However fraternities were
still required to honor the right of the freshman to visit the
house on the scheduled rush date.

By the time rush ended this year people had already
begun to face tests and to feel the crunch academically.
Kither someone is going to have to ask for the faculty’s mercy
throughout September or rush needs to be shortened. In this
rather uneven contest it would be advisable for the IFC to
shorten rush.

We would also suggest that domitory rush either be
opened up or dispensed with altogether. As it now stands
fraternity men are allowed in the dorms only once in a blue
moon and the wily freshman can usually evade their in-
vaders. The houses should either be given a fair chance of
seeing the freshmen in the dorms or refused entrance com-
pletely.

One of the worst problems, or at least one of the most
persistent, is dirty rush, Over the years, with no restraint,
some houses have developed rather elaborate systems and
techniques of hurling diatribes at other houses, This year a
rush official was assigned to each house to see that such
infractions were not allowed, This gentleman was often
given a tour of the bathroom facilities or the boiler room so
that he could not interfere with a fraternity’s technique.

Once again dirty rush was utilized by many houses
which succeeded in exhibiting the pettiness of those who en-
gaged in the practice. Something should be done to force
W&L gentlemen to start acting like gentlemen in this respect.

Although there is a great deal that might be changed
about rush to make it more tolerable and enjoyable for all
those involved it is basically a good system. It allows those
who participate to become acquainted with many groups of
people on campus who would probably remain unknown and
unappreciated without such a formal structure,

The IFC has established a rush committee headed by
vice-president Darrell LaPrade to investigate possible re-
forms to the rush procedure, Of course “reform” implies ma-
jor overhaul which is inappropriate, but there a few matters
which could be slightly changed to make rush more profit-
able, We only venture to hope that if change is affected it
will be kept to a minimum and enhance the value of rush
rather than make it ineffective.

By BARNEY SKELTON

Entertainment Editor

I have listened for four years
now to W&L students making the
most scurrilous of remarks
about this lovely little town nestl-
ed in the fold of the Shenandoah
Valley, and | think it is time
to come to its defense. So, as
entertainment editor of this rag
I intend to leap into the fray,
and strike down that wildly in-
accurate assertion that “‘there is
nothing to do in Lexington.” Now
1 am not talking about anything
the University offers, ie. con-
certs, plays, dances, ete., rather
I am refering only to the myriad
of attractions which the city and
the surrounding area itself pro-
vides.

Of course, the most obvious ex-
amples to turn to, are those
bastions of cinematic grandeur,
“The Lyric” (or “The Pit’), and
“The State” theatres. Why only
last year “The Lyric” held Lex-
ington’s premier showing of Gone
With the Wind. Unfortunately,
for reasons beyond his control,
Clarke Gable declined to attend.
However, the show was held over
for an unprecedented week and
two days, and only then was it
ceased due to Wé&L students
protesting the fact that it was
holding up a Kung Fu triple fea-
ture.

A seasonal feature is the high-
ly touted annual Moose Carnival,
held in the spring. Besides the
ferris wheel, pony rides and

clowns (these are always a hit
with the W&L crowd) there is
an excellent Follies Bergere Re-
vue. The reason, I suppose that so
many W&L men attend this re-
vue is that the dancers all exude
that “girl next door” look, be she
from 42nd street, “the Block,” or
LaGrange, Texas.

However, it is not just the
major attractions which Lexing-
ton offers that I intend to ad-
dress. The events I enjoy, and find
entertaining are often little
things. For instance, I’ve always

exington-it does require
a good sense of humor

found it amusing to watch that
lovable town drunk, and (as he
steadfastly maintains) former
Harlem Globetrotter, Mr. Skinny
Doc, making his way down Main
Street. As if by the benevolence
of the City Fathers, there seem
to be just enough parking meters
available for him to hold on to
so that he can make it all the
way without a fall, Another under-
rated item is the sizzling show
which that sexy scooper at High’s
Ice Cream Parlour puts on. I’ve
sometimes sat there for five or

six cones, but, then again I’ve
always been a sucker for “bee-
hive” hairdo’s.

Alas, as space does not permit
me I must cease my address
here, leaving numerous people,
places, and events unrecognized.
However, if | may interject a
parthian shot, I will always main-
tain that the only requisite for
enjoying your stay in Lexington
is a good sense of humor. If you
do not have that, it is unlikely
you will be happy anywhere else,
either,

What does the IFC do?

By SADINOEL

Most of the students on this
campus are largely unaware of
what the Interfraternity Council
really does. Freshmen are only
exposed to this body during rush
and thus are given the impres-
sion that everything the IFC does
is somehow restrictive to the fra-
ternities.

It is bad enough that freshmen
think of the IFC as the body
responsible for not allowing them
to drink anything but cokes at
open houses, What is worse is
that the conception of the IFC
held by most wpperclassmen is
almost as narrow. This is to
imply that the IFC is doing more
than most students are aware of
and that it is not fully recognized

for its constribution to the school.

The Interfraternity Council
really does do a great deal to
promote the best interests of the
fraternities which represent about
two-thirds of the student body.
In addition it sponsors and co-
sponsors many activities on cam-
pus which add to the general
betterment of Washington and
Lee.

The largest monetary contribu-
tion the IFC makes is to Contact.
Last year it granted the Contact
Committee a total of $3000. This
was a gift given with no stimpla-
tions as to its use. In fact the
IFC has nothing to say about
the choice of Contact speakers
and was rarely kept up with de-
velopments in the Contact pro-
gram last year. Needless to say,

Stafford Wing: a singing parable

By PHILLIP ENRICO, Jr.

Last Thursday night at 8:00 in
Lee Chapel, the community
around W&L was offered a pleas-
ant diversion as the Concert Guild
inaugurated its annual program
with a concert featuring Stafford
Wing, a tenor soloist. He was ac-
companied on the piano as he
sang in German, English, French,
and Italian for an hour without
any written notes or prompting
of any kind. Yet, it was not only
his professionalism which im-
pressed everyone.

Mr. Wing is symbolic of true
greatness in mankind. He mea-
sures up to the formerly chaste
definition of artist which meant
absolute devotion to an ideal
greater than oneself, One can ad-
mire the man who trains him-
self many hours just to grasp a
level of perfection which cannot
be sustained longer than a single
hour in spare, little Lee Chapel.

Letters
To the Editor

Party

Through the centuries that
Washington and Lee University
has been in existence many leg-
ends and myths have grown and
been spread concerning the men
of old W&L. In distant parts of
the country many speak of the
beautiful school in Lexington
with the long standing tradition
of “aeademic excellence and wild
parties,” and the perpetuators of
that tradition have been called
a unique breed,

When | personally was honored
with Dean Farrar’s invitation to
Lexington, | looked forward to
being part of this rich heritage.
In my vears at W&L I have found
that while the academics are even
tougher than one would have ex-
pected, one might be slightly dis-
appointed with the social life in
light of the stories concerning
past years. The “W&éL gentile-
man” no longer seems to live
up to the traditional ideal of
work and roadtrips five nights
a week and nothing but wild
partying the entire weekend.
There's too much work being
done in too much time. As a re-
sult there has been a minimum
of hard core partying done as
of iale.

Now it just so happens that
an excellent opportunity ia com-
ing up when we can put aside
our books and give new life to
the W&L party tradition. You
some idiot decided to have

(Contmued on page 4)

aoe,

That was what Mr. Wing ac-
complished last Thursday. It was
refreshing just to reflect on the
devotion of the man. When one
considers the dilettantes who
make up too many of the stu-
dents of this college, one feels a
dull, sick pain in the depths of
the heart which is too deep for
tears. Their aimless lives, con-
sumed in gross excesses, stand in
sharp contrast to the dedication
ef this tenor. For those who feel
that life is too short to waste on
drunken dissipation, dishonorable
sluts, and similar decrement of
humanity, Mr. Wing represents
the viable hope that there is a
worthy goal to achieve in life.
Like Wittgenstein, he exempli-
fies the man whose consecration
demands heart, mind, soul, and
strength in service to his ideal.

The translations provided were
helpful because they showed the
audience that the performer felt
what he sang.

Among the German pieces, for
example, Mr. Wing sang with
reverence “Schlafendes Jesukind,”
which deseribed the Lord Jesus
as a child with His mother. The
same reverence was heard as he
sang “Auf ein altes Bild,” stir-
ring even to the unbelieving, in
whieh the boy Jesus played in a
meadow, while not far off was
maturing the tree whose wood
would serve for His cross.

Perhaps the most poignant
song of the concert was “Ver-
borgenheit.” In its appeal for
solitude as a balm for insecrut-
able inward longings, the im-
perative “Leave me to myself,
O world!” awakes understandabie
sympathy In the modern listener.

Competition

makes dating

difficult

Next week the conrpetition for
dates in the Valley should be a
bit more strenuous than usual.
The easy access that W&L men
have enjoved to the surrounding
girls schools seems to be on the
verge of disappearing.

This weekend is Parents’ Week-
end at Mary Baldwin College.
To make matters worse Hamp-
denSydney and Virginia are both
having big goinge<n. It sounds
like W&L gentlemen are going
to have to shape up their pro-
grams or face annihilation as a
potent force on nearby campuses.

In thie day and time it is no
longer possible for just runof-
the-mill fieh to eall a girls’ school

There were some delightful,
whimsical songs by Erik Satie
which Mr. Wing sang with such
roguishness that he provoked
laughter throughout Lee Chapel.
The great tenor had such a wry
expression on his face, what
could one do but laugh?

The concert ended with selec-
tions from Benjamin Britten's
“Sonnets of Michelangelo,” rather
dull in their operatic Italian; so,
it was perhaps an unfortunate
ending. Yet, when it was over
the audience was enthusiastic in
the applause it gave Mr, Wing.

As everyone left, there was a
cheery feeling of greatness in
General Lee’s chapel. One can-
not be so impious as to say that
Mr. Wing's performance was a
religious experience, but to a
society which in its folly has
rejected God, it was an experi-
ence as nearly divine as will ever
be felt by its citizens. For the
happy faithful, it was a further
manifestation of the truth in
Genesis 1:27.

the IFC has no representative on
the Contact Committee who could
solely represent its interests.
Various public service endeav-
ors also receive the support of
the Interfraternity Council. Last
year it endorsed the Hunger Walk
and urged the fraternities to
participate in and support this
cause. For the United Fund Drive
and the Blood Drive the IFC en-
couraged the houses to cooperate
by promising a keg to the fra-
ternities offering the greatest sup-
port for each of these projects.

The Interfraternity Council is
made up of representatives from
the social fraternities on campus
and thus contributes to the social
life here to a considerable degree.
For Fancy Dress last year the
Student Activities Board was able
to work through the IFC to in-
sure itself of selling enough
tickets to make the weekend pos-
sible. When the SAB failed to
offer the campus any entertain-
ment for last Spring Weekend the
IFC took up the slack and spon-
sored a dance on Saturday night.
Later in the month the IFC
plans to sponsor a combo at the
Pavillion with swill for the gen-
eral gratification of fraternity
members,

The generosity of this group
finds outlets in many other mis-
cellaneous activities. Last year it
contributed $300 to send imem-
bers of the lacrosse team on an
international tour to play lacrosse
in Australia. In a different reaim,
it paid the room and board for
many foreign exchange students
who were housed in fraternities.

The fraternity system at Wash-
ington and Lee accomplishes
many things which benefit the
whole school and not just fra-
ternity members. Its public ser-
vice capacity is one aspect of
which many are unaware, but in
consideration of its accomplish-
ments it should not be taken for
granted,

Hampden-Sydney proved — to
Washington and Lee Saturday
that its reputation as a strong de-
fensive football team was more
than a rumor, as they completely
stymied the usually potent W&L
attack enroute to a 16-6 win in
the annual Jaycees charity game
in ‘Lynehburg.

Led by All-American defensive
end candidate Hd Kelley, who
spent as much time in the W&L
baofield as did the Generals’ run-
ning backs, the Tigers held W&L
to eight first downs and 184
total offensive yards for the game.
In the process they ran _ their
string of scoreless quarters to 16
before a NCAA record-tying 99-
yard scoring pass from Jack
Berry to fullback Mercer West
with 3:21 to play ended the shut-
out streak,

The H-S defense also accounted
for the Tigers’ lone touchdown,
as safety Holt Moran went 35
yards for a score with one of the
five interceptions Berry suffered

Rugby season
has a slow start

By the Phi Sports Staff

The Washington and Lee Rugby
Club remains scoreless after drop-
ping its first two games to
Lynchburg and Hampden-Sydney.

Playing in Lynchburg last
weekend before the Jaycee Bow]
football game, the Blues gave up
four tries to Hampden-Sydney,
losing 16-0,

When the Generals met Lynch-
burg on the Blues’ thhome turf
Sept. 28, the official scorer lost
count in the second half of the
match as the visiting team’s
score neared fifty.

 

WésL falls again
as H-S defense,
Kelley key 16-6 win

in the game.

Kicker George Simons provided
all of the Tigers’ offensive punch,
with field goals of 35, 23, and 35
yards in addition to the extra
point after Moran’s touchdown.

Meanwhile the W&L defense
gave its best showing of the year,
holding the H-4S offense at bay
throughout the game, Two of
Simons’ field goals were the total
offensive production for
night.

Further evidence of the de-
fensive domination of the game
were the 22 punts, eleven coming
from each team, Simons, despite
being credited with a four-yard
punt after
over his head, still averaged
39.5 yards a kick, while W&L
freshman George Makris aver-
aged 37 yards per punt,

The game was nothing like last
year’s matchup, which proved to
be a mismatch as H-S steamrolled
a then unbeaten Generals squad,
42-4, The 1973 contest was far
from the “bowl game” jabel the
Jaycees attach to the contest,
but this year’s affair was fitting
of any post-season tussel.

After a scoreless first quarter,
which saw neither team cross the
midfield stripe, HS got on the
scoreboard early in the second
period as Simons connected on a
35-yard field goal with 13:45 to
play.

W&L had a scoring opportun-
ity later in the quarter when Jon
Markley recovered a Jon Daly
fumble at the Tigers 22. The
threat was snuffed out when
Kelley spilled West for an eleven
yard loss on a sereen pass, and
on the next play, David Paxton
grabbed the first of the intercep-
tions.

It was after halftime when the
Tigers defensive unit took con-
trol of the game. On the second
play after the kickoff, a Berry

A football team needs support

By BILL FLESHER

For Washington and Lee's foot-
ball team, the first half of the
1974 football season now belongs
to the past.

To the ‘players, the mistakes,
frustrations, and outcomes of the
first five games are no more than
distant memories. The winless
streak admittedly has been a try-
ing experience for everyone in-
volved. Yet depsite it all the
team morale is higher than it
has been in years, and the sens-
ing of a victory in the not-at-all-
distant future is a real one.

The team members will forget
these five discouraging weeks.
But I can't file them away with-
out some words—few of them
complimentary—about the atti-
tudes of you, the self-proclaimed,
so-called “fans” of the Generals.

With the exception of the
months which see Wilson Field
as the home of a lacrosse team

which has enjoyed immense suc-
and, admittedly, fine fan
support in recent years, the ma-
jority of the university com-
munity shares a rotten attitude
toward some of their best friends
who make up the athletic squads
at W&L,

There are those individuals—
who constitute a definite minor-
ity—who deserve more than com-
pliments for their continued sup-
port of athletics at W&L. Not
enough can be said for them.

Yet the majority is a case for
analysis. Football games are for
many a social event, a party
thrown by the Athletic Depart-
ment for the purpose of blowing
out a date, making a fool of
oneself, or a combination § of
both.

For others they're simply a
spacefiller on the Weekly
Calendar to be merely ignored in
favor of an afternoon surrounded-

cess

Weekly Football Contest

ed by a blaring stereo and a case
of National Bohs.

Others would drive up to 600
miles to see Alabama, Penn State,
Maryland, or the Redskins play.
Yet they wouldn't consider a 45-
minute drive to see W&lL play
in nearby Lynchburg, as was
evidenced by the slim crowd from
Lexington—largely made up of
those “minority memibers’’—on
Saturday night.

It's about time the people who
make W&L change their outlook
on football and athletics in gen-
eral. To support the hometown-
ers or homestaters is great—but
don’t you think that will some-
day become your alma mater de-
serves some support as well,

You do a hell of a job for the
lacrosse team, but why quit
there? It's time for that change,
as it is time for the football
team to get back on the track—
right now,

Madison’s nationally ranked
soccer team, held in check in
the first half by Washington and
Lee’s defense, exploded for three
goals in the first ten minutes of
the second half to earn a 3-2 win
Sunday in a Virginia Intercollegi-
ate Soccer Association game.

Forward Kenny Morris turned
two Ray LaRoche passes into a
pair of goals, while John Provost
added the third goal on a penalty
kick to rally the Dukes, now 7-
1-2, from a 1-0 halftime deficit.

A healthy gathering at Smith
Field saw the Generals jump to
a 1-0 yead with six minutes gone,
when Chuck Alexander scored off
a Billy Cogar pass. Madison ap-
plied the pressure throughout the
first half, only to have several
threats broken up by the W&L
fulbacks, led by Barclay Arm-
strong. At the same time Gen-
erals’ goalie Paul Devine was
playing faultlessly, making 13
first half saves including a rob-
bery of a high driving blast by
LaRoche midway through the
opening period.

But the Dukes broke the game
open in the second half. Morris
tied the score at 1-1 with just
1:40 gone. Five minutes later,
after a tripping penalty against
Wé&L, Provost scored on a pen-
alty kick which Devine blocked
but could not hold, Three minutes
after that, Morris scored again,
as LaRoche set him up with a
centering pass through three
WEL defenders.

Then the Dukes defense, spear-
headed by Nino Altamonte, shut
off the Generals’ offense until
Jim Fox seored on a head shot
with 5:14 to play. The loss drop-
ped W&L to 1-1-2 heading into
yesteday’s home match with
Washington (Md.) College. The
Generals host Virginia Tech at
2 p.m, on Saturday.

pass to Tony Perry deflected into
the hands of Moran, who, with
Kelley and linebacker Ed Keefer
throwing key blocks, rambled 35
yards untounched into the end
zone, Simons’ kick was good.

Two plays later, Bobby Rid-
dicks stepped in front of Eamon
Cassell for a third theft, returning
it 26 yards to the W&L 10. But
the Generals’ defense didn’t
budge, forcing Simons to kick a
22-yard field goal making it 13-0
with 12:59 left in the quarter.

Later in the quarter the Tigers
staged their best offensive drive
of the night, moving from their
16 to the W&L 3. But a clipping
penalty moved the ball out to the
18. Then Simons returned and
kicked another 35-yarder to send
H4S to a 16-0 lead.

On the following series the Gen-
evals, aided by two interference
calls, moved to the Tiger 28, But
another interception, this one by
linebacker Dusty Balblard, killed
a W&L scoring threat.

Another mistake cost W&L a
scoring chance in the fourth
quarter, when a nifty 41-yard punt
return by Charlie Brown was
nullified by an illegal blocking
penalty.

It was Brown, the victim of
the referee's call that resulted in

their “biggie” for sometime that

have a tapes combo like last
spring and save the money for
grain.
