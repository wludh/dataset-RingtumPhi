University with new “balance sheets.”

Through great insight and hard work he has
turned what might have been dormant assets of

avenues to sell the patterns of

he has contrived to have reproductions of the
Reeves Collection produced in such a way as to
provide even greater royalties to the University
from its use. By finding new ways to utilize this
collection he has brought wide-spread publicity to
the school; even the White House has found a
way to use Wamsutta’s Porcelain Butterfly sheets.

This is the ninth year in which the Ring-tum

edge substantial contributions to the school from
people whose work and dedication might other-
wise have been overlooked by the student body,

Development program outlined

ty STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

On February 22, 1972, Presi-
dent Huntley announced a $56
million development drive for
Washington and Lee, The first
phase of the plan was to raise $36
million by 1976; these funds
would be used to enlarge the
University’s endowment, to ex-
pand and improve the physical
plant, and to augment the year-
ly operating budgets.

Three quarters of that initial
four year period have shipped by,
and in terms of total dollars
pledged the program is about
where it should be, with $28 mil-
lion already given or committed
to the University. In terms of
the development of new facili-
ties what seems to be lagging
is the construction of the new
library.

Many students graduate from
this institution without realiz-
ing what consumes much of the
time the Board of Trustees de-
vote to W&L. Most students are
not aware of the comprehensive
development plans which are
generated by the Board. All who
attend here, and particularly
those who will soon graduate,
should have some general know!l-
edge of the broad outline being
followed by W&L in the constant
effort to improve the quality of
education for its students.

‘The needs of the University
demand that we raise at least
$36 million by 1976; against this

broad objective we have raised
something shy of $28 million.”
So states Farris Hotchkiss, Di-
rector of University Develop-
ment. It is a major task of Mr.
Hotchkiss’ office to coordinate
the activities of the many groups
involved in generating support
for W&L's ambitious program.

Specifically, what the first
phase of the program consists
of is an increase in the Uni-
versity'’s endowment of $14 mil-
lion, an outlay of $18'» million
for new construction and renova-
tions to existing buildings, and
the accumulation of $3'» million
to be used in the general operat-
ing budget.

The endowment of the Uni-
versity stood at approximately
$24 million at the outset of the
development program. To date
roughly $4 million has been in-
vested in the University's port-
folio, and another $3.8 million
has been pledged In this area
the program is behind on its
goal; with 75% of the time period
elapsed, only 65° of the target
figure for endowment has been
raised. During this period the
decline in the market value of
the endowment has also more
than offset the increases, al-
though the income from the in-
vestments has remained virtually
unchanged

The second major portion of
the program, the construction of
new facilities, while on schedule
in terms of total dollars com-
mitted is lagging in terms of

tangible development. Specifical-
ly, construction of the library has
been delayed owing to insuffici-
ent funding of the addition to
Doremus Gymnasium.

The new wing on the gym was
constructed first for a number
of reasons. As the most-used
building on campus, surpassing
even the library in usage, the old
gym was a detriment to the
moraie of students and faculty
alike. It was desperately in need
of renovation, and in fact an
expansion of the building had
been promised for a number of
years. At the start of the pro-
gram a few extraordinarily gen-
erous alumni made substantial
gifts to the University specific-
ally for construction of a new
gymnasium. These gifts. totaling

about $'» million, enabled the
project to get off the drawing
board quickly. As the smallest

item. financially, of the majo
construction projects envisioned,
and as its construction would
intrude the least on the main
campus plan, it was decided to
bulld the structure early in the
program Architectural plans
were developed rather speedily
‘six months as compared to eigh-
teen months for the plans of the
library), and the project was
compieted in a minimum of time
By getting the gymnasium ad-
dition underway, the University
avoided escalating costs that
have hampered the library pro-
ome extent

Should W&L admit women?

* BEN BAILEY

Does W&L really need women?
A special committee of the Board
of Trustees was established at
the beginning of this academic
year to investigate the possibility
of co-education at Washington
and Lee. The committee, con-
sisting of four Trustees, the
deans, and the student body
president, has consulted alumni,
parents, the faculty, the EC, and

other schools for answers to the |

following questions.

Why should W&L consider go-
ing co-ed? Social, philosophical

and practical reasons are all
worth mentioning.

dating would be simplier if the
girls lived in Lexington. In a
world where all minorities, in-
cluding women, are participating
more fully than ever before, the
preservation of an _ all-male
school apparently ignores all the
“facts of life,’ and may indeed
prove to be inadequate training
for the future, And, from a prac-
tical standpoint, the quantity and
quality of W&L’s applicants has
dropped in the last few years. If
you have little faith in objective
measures like board scores and
class rank, just ask your favorite
professor what he thinks of the
most recent entering classes, and

The co-ed question revived

Elsewhere on this page President of the Student Body Ben

Bailey asks the question,

“Does

W&L

really need women?”

Mr. Bailey is only doing his job in bringing this question to
the attention of the students, but we find it regrettable that
such a query must be considered again, Of course, W&L
does not need women, any more than it needs space-age
architecture or a course in basket weaving offered by the art
department,

Mr. Bailey reiterates some of the same arguments for co-
education that we have all heard, and yawned at, from the
day one. Although we appreciate Bailey's open-mindedness,
“social, philosophical, and practical reasons” are not worth
mentioning. W&L cannot, and should not attempt to, educate
its students in the ways of the world, It should provide a
haven for individual development outside the pressures and

who apply here. W&L has been holding its own on this
front and has maintained high standards, unlike some of the
schools to which Mr. Bailey alludes. As to the quantity of
applicants, the numbers are on the decline nationally, but
Washington and Lee has managed to stay well ahead of
most schools in this regard.

In other words, there is no reason for alarm at this point,
and no true indication that the school is heading toward hard
times. We believe that Washington and Lee can maintain
its traditional high standards without sacrificing its distinctive
character by adopting that which is currently fashionable in
egghead circles. Carting in truckloads of females would
jeopardize W&L.’s unique environment. In the light of Mr.
Bailey's considerations on co-education, we feel that Wash-
ington and Lee has a great deal to lose by such a move, with
a less-than-complete picture of what cauld be gained, if
anything.

students are less qualified than
before.

What are the pros and cons of
co-education? This basic ques-
tion breaks down into many
particular queries. What effect
will girls have on the fraternity
system? What will happen to
the area's girl schools if W&L
becomes co-ed? How will the cur-
riculum be affected, if at all?
Will the calibre of the student
body improve? (Evidence from
other schools which have recent-
| ly gone co-ed indicates that the
| quality does increase.) Will the
financial aid program be severely
pressed for funds? Where shall
we put the girls and how much
will it cost? Do we have adequate
physical education facilities for

,; women? (The athletic depart-

| ment thinks not.) And what im-
pact will women have on the
community spirit of which W&L
is so justifiably proud? Will the
Honor System be strained?

The answers to these and
many other questions suround-
ing co-education must be de-
termined before any action is
taken,

Three possible ways to add
women have been tried else-
where. Some schools remain the
same size and simply substitute
girls for guys. Others maintain
the size of the male student
population and add women, thus
enlarging the student body. The
third way is a compromise, in
which two or three hundred men

are dropped and five or six hun-
dred women added. If W&L goes
co-educational, one of these
models will be employed.

What do you think about the
question raised above? The
Trustees’ committee instructed
me to solicit student opinions on
the prospects of co-education.
They would welcome your writ-
ten comments, and would like to
have them in time for the Trus-
tees’ meeting next week. If you
would like to sound off on what
would be right or wrong about
co-education, please send your
comments to me at post office
box 456, drop them off at Ken
Lane's office, bring them to Mon-
day's EC meeting at 7:00 p.m.,
or slide them under the door to
the EC room anytime.

Letters to the Editor...

Arguments against

the $5 proposal aired

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
I oppose the five dollar pro-

posal as presented to the Execu-

tive Committee because of its

serious conceptual, financial, and

administrative flaws

The proposal allows small in-
terest groups to commit a por-
tion of the student body tax to
their endeavors. Thus, one’s self-
ish interests would be the motive
for the spending of our monies,
the Executive Committee would
surrender some of its strength as
a representative body, according
to this plan. Were the EC to
institute this policy, they would
be abdicating their present con-
trol of the purse strings and
their elected responsibility,

While propents of the five dol-
lar proposal claim that it would
insure more representative gov-
ernment, better utilization of the
channels now open to them
would accomplish this. The pro-
gram of the EC's standing sub-
committees should be carefully
evaluated and frequently observ-
ed. This would insure that por-
tions of the student tax are
wisely spent. Furthermore, should
a student or group of students
wish monies to fund a project,
such funds can be requested of
the Executive Committee. I see
no need for the paperwork and
the expenditure of much time
that would result from the five
dollar proposal when any W&L
student can currently request
that he be allowed monies from
the student tax.

It should be noted that the
five dollar proposal does not give
members of the student body
liscense to spend portions of the
Student body tax as they wish.
Students seeking funds for their
project must convince their
classmates of its worth, solicite
student body support, petition
the EC. Then, they may or may
not be granted the desired funds.
I fail to see the difference be-
tween current policy, whereby
one solicites funds from the EC
by convincing them of the worth
of his idea and is granted the
money only if the EC approves,
and the proposed five dollar pol-
ley, whereby one solicites funds
from the EC by convincing them
of the worth of his idea and is
granted the money only if the
EC approves.

From a financial perspective,
it is doubtful whether the needs
of the EC standing subcommit-
tees (such as the Student Activi-
ies Board which spends monies
on the entire student body)
could be fulfilled if $8,000 of the
student tax were marked “hands
off” in accordance with the five
dollar proposal, Rather, this
money would be spent, not by
those whom were elected to ad-
minister our student tax, but by
various cliques with their own

subjective interests. The EC
would operate with an insuffici-
ent budget that would not allow
for the cost of living increases
nor for improvement upon exist-
ing programs. In short, we would
have to settle for less than we
had this year, while our tax
would be raised $5 per student.

Indeed, this year’s EC, whose
budget was $48,000 (approxi-
mately next year’s budget ac-
cording to the five dollar pro-
posal) had a difficult task
making ends meet. They twice
were forced to dip into the re-
serve fund to “balance” their
books. To return to the days
when the EC could work within
their budget, an $8,000 student
tax increase was deemed neces-
sary and granted, Yet, propon-
ents of the five dollar proposal
claim that they can manage with
last year’s allotment. Their pro-
posal would undo what the tax
increase is designed to do: name-
ly, to provide the EC with a
realistic budget with which to
operate, and to insure that the
Student tax is fairly distributed
among all students. It seems right
that the members of the Execu-
tive Committee, being account-
able to their constituency, are
the custodian of all the student
tax. Proponents of the five dol-
lar proposal would have one-
seventh of the budget placed in
the hands of the students at
large who are responsible only
to themselves.

The amount of interest that
this proposal would generate
among the student body is also
questionable. The recent Univer-
sity Council elections echo
charges of student apathy. For
three senior positions, the class
of "76 fielded two candidates, the
third member being elected on
a write-in ballot with less than
thirty votes. The class of ‘77
posted two candidates for two
positions. Do these disappoint-
ing results lead one to believe
many students will take the
initiative to solicite the support
of their classmates to present an
acceptable project for EC ap-
proval? «The president-elect has
stated that grain parties do not
constitute “acceptable projects").

While the goal of the propon-
ents of the five dollar propsal
to insure a more representative
budget is an admirable and at-
tainable one, I fear, for the
above reasons cited, that their
efforts may be somewhat mis-
directed. Rather than earmark-
ing one-seventh of the total
budget for worthwhile student
organizations or endeavors, the
EC should better publicize their
current policy to fund student
projects and should be receptive
to the needs of those students
whose interests are not refi®cted
by the various standing subcom-
mittees.

Arguments supporting
the $5 plan expressed

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
Apathy: The $5 plan chal-
lenges campus apathy in two
ways. First, the plan makes each
student responsible for allocat-
ing $5 of the student body bud-
get. Second, by making money
directly available to any campus
group which can convince stu-
dents to donate their $5 to its
activities, the plan encourages
students to organize, to carry
out a campus-related program.
In addition, the plan can be
used to improve or purchase
equipment for any part of the
university, Thus the $5 plan
makes possible EC funding for
any group arousing student in-
terest and includes each stu-
dent in the allocation process.

Administration: Two propos-
als have been advocated for ad-
ministering the $5 plan. Each
involves some paperwork for the
EC, but under neither of the
proposals are the EC's minist-
erial duties overwhelming.

Insufficient funds to finance
the $5 plan: The 1975-1976 stu-
dent budget has been increased
$8,000, the amount necessary to
fund the $5 plan. The separate
financing of Mock Convention,
coupled with additional savings,
has made available another $3.,-
500 for next year’s budget. Thus
activities which are presently
funded can receive, in addition
to the amount they received this
year, part of the $3,500 extra
funds and leave $8,000 for the
donation plan.

Some presently funded com-
mittees argue, however, that the
$3,500 split among them is in-
sufficient to cover increased costs
and the activities which they
have planned for next year. This
argument overlooks three points.
First, any student could donate
his $5 to a currently funded com-
mittee and thereby increase its
budget. Second, to force com-
mittees to operate within slightly
increased budgets next year
would force each committee to
reevaluate its programs to cut

wasteful activities. Third, though

the organjzations presently re- °

ceiving EC money are important,
they are not the ONLY student
activities worthy of funding. The
$5 plan would make 6/7 avail-
able to currently budgeted com-
mittees, and leave 1/7 available
for all other campus activities,
Such an allocation would seem
fair.

Fraternity livens up
spring social calendar

To the Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

As the wise man once said to
his disgruntled son, “You only
go around once in life, but if
you live it right, once is enough.”
Well, fellas, that saying can be
applied to the spring term at
W&L.

It just doesn’t seem like there
have been enough of the “vint-
age” W&L parties this spring—
those heavy on “wine, women
and song.” But exams are not
here yet and you're not home
scrounging for that summer job
yet. You can salvage those last
hours of partying and you can
squeeze out those remaining bits
of wildness.

Delta Tau Delta is going to
give you an opportunity for a
last, big spring fling this Friday
night, May 16, from 8:30 on.
There will be lots of women,
constant music and plenty of
liquor. And, for the wildest of
the wild, there will be a Gator-
ing Contest later the same eve-
ning. There will be a 50 cent ad-
mission charge for this contest
and prizes will be awarded—
three $5 third prizes, one $10
second prize and one $25 ’prize.

So, if you missed other parties
this spring or are anxious to have
one last big one, come to Delta
Tau Delta Friday night. You can
drink and juke and flirt and
gator the night away. It'll put
you in the right frame of mind
to watch W&L whip the Wahoos
on Saturday.

Generals defeat Rutgers, look to U.Va.

The crowd probably won't
match last year’s record-setting
10,000, but it figures to tax the
7,000-seat capacity of Wilson
Field when Washington and Lee
is host to its old rival, the Uni-
versity of Virginia, here Satur-
day.

The annual battle for state
supremacy between the two la-
crosse powers will get under way
at 2:00 p.m. Both teams are
hopeful of receiving invitations
to the NCAA _ championship
tournament for the fourth
straight year.

Virginia, 6-4 for the season, is
currently ranked fourth among
University division teams, with
W&L's Generals 10th with a 9-6
record,

This year’s crowd probably
won't be as large because Vir-
ginia will have finished school
and most of its students will
have left the campus. The two
teams played earlier in the sea-
son last year when the largest
crowd to see a lacrosse game in
the Old Dominion sat in sun-
drenched Scott Stadium. W&L
won the game, which was tele-
vised nationally, 13-11.

It, appeared to observers that
about 6,000 fans sat on the Vir-
ginia side, the other 4,000 on the
W&L side.

However many come to this
Saturday’s game, they should
see another classic example of
the ever-growing popular sport
of lacrosse. Virginia, which boasts
a potent defense around goalie
Rodney Rullman and defenseman
Willie Hazlehurst, numbers per-
ennial lacrosse power Maryland
among its victims.

With one of the most potent
attacks in the country, W&L Gen-
erals under Coach Jack Emmer
have beaten Towson (at the time
ranked no. 1 among college di-
vision teams) and leveled Roa-
noke, 15-11, and no. 7-ranked
Rutgers, 14-13, in their most re-
cent action last week.

Among them, W&L’s three at-

Lexington
Hardware

23 S. Main
463-2242

tackmen have scored 115 goals,
with junior Rob Morgan scor-
ing 47, senior Dave Warfield and
junior Don Carroll 34 each.
Those three also lead the team
in assists, with Carroll record-
ing 42, Warfield 25 and Morgan
24.

That gives W&L’s attack trio
a total point production of 206—
76 for Carroll, 71 for Morgan
and 59 for Warfield in just 10
games.

W&L’'s resurgence from early
season disappointments has come
about with the return of injur-
ed All-American attackman Dave
Warfield and a steadily improv-
ing young team.

Warfield, who missed almost
the entire half of the season
with a knee injury, ripped in six
goals against Roanoke and had
one goal and three assists against
Rutgers before suffering a frac-
tured thumb early in the game.
His status against Virginia is ex-
tremely doubtful.

With Warfield having one of
the best days in his career,
W&L and Roanoke battled on
even terms in Roanoke’s Victory
Stadium through nearly three
quarters of action before W&L
scored the last three goals to
pull away. The senior from
Baltimore's St. Paul's school
scored two quick goals in just
1:39 and had five by halftime,
with W&L ahead, 9-7. With Roa-
noke goalie Joe Viola keeping
the Maroons in the game with
some excellent saves, the home
team closed to within a goal,
12-11, midway through the third
quarter.

But from that point W&L
dominated the game almost com-
pletely and pulled away for the
victory.

In contrast, the Generals first
nearly blew visiting Rutgers off
the field, at one point opening
up a seven-goal advantage, 13-6,
then had to withstand a gallant
Rutgers comeback to win by one
goal, 14-13.

quarter appeared to slow down

Rutgers scored six unanswered
goals to trim W&L’s lead to 13-

goal, but they either missed or
were stopped by W&L goalie
Charlie Brown.

W&L attackman Rob Morgan

Rich Scipione to score what
proved to be the winning goal
with just 36 seconds left. Rutgers
scored 11 seconds later, to cut

Wé#L development program outlined

(Continued from page 1)

But funding has never been
completed on the Doremus pro-
ject. The facility cost $3.3 mil-
lion, and only $1.3 has been
raised. The remainder was origi-
nally financed in what seemed a
satisfactory way, assuming the
completion of funding in a short
time. The finance charges have
been mounting, however, and at
one point were exceeding 11%
annual interest. It is because of
the existence of this funding
shortage that construction has
not been started on the library.
As soon as commitments have
been received to enable full furnd-
ing for the gym, bids will be Ici
on the other facility.

The construction of the new
law school was made possible
by the extremely generous gift of
$9 million to W&L by Sydney
Lewis, an alumnus and president
of Best Products. To a great ex-
tent Mr. Lewis’ contribution sped
up that project and provided
impetus to the overall develop-
ment program.

The third major part of the
University’s four year plan is
the raising of the sum of $32
million through what is called
Annual Giving, which in itself
is composed of three items:
alumni contributions not design-
ated as endowment, contributions
made by parents, and corporate
contributions made through the
aegis of Virginia Foundation for
Independent Colleges. Funds gen-
erated through the Annual Giv-
ing program directly aid the Uni-
versity in balancing its current
operating budget. In contrast,
capital gifts, gifts invested in

either endowment or physical
plant, become assets of the school
and are not “spent’’ on salaries
and other operating costs.

Class agents and the chairman
of the Parents’ Fund function as
the primary intermediaries in
the collection of Annual Giving
contributions, Money is being
raised, as far as capital gifts
are concerned, by a group of men
known as the Achievement Coun -
cil, chaired by John M. Stem-
mons of Dallas, a member of
the Board of Trustees. The men
who make up the Achievement
Council are drawn from the
Board of Trustees, the board of
directors for the Alumni Associa-
tion, and from alumni and par-
ents generally. The Council has
assumed the major responsibility
for raising the $36 million by
concentrating on the solicitation
of Leadership Gifts of $100,000 or
more that indicate active con-
cern and general support of
the needs of the University. In

other words, members of the
Council are “not knocking on
every door on the block,” as Mr.
Hotchkiss puts it.

The W&L development pro-
gram is unusual in that it is
almost entirely qualitative rather
than quantitative in bearing; the
size of the University is expect-
ed to stay at about the same level
throughout the program. Most
universities are constantly ex-
panding their enrollment and are
forced to embark on new de-
velopment just to provide mini-
mal facilities for their students.
In view of the total program, the
record of achievement has been
remarkable, as relatively few
fund-raising ventures by other
institutions have been as success-
ful in meeting their overall goals.
It appears that with consistent
effort in the coming year the
initial target figure will be reach-
ed, and that enormous sum of
$56 million to be attained by
1979 may actually be attainable.
