Independents meet,
plan for revival

A meeting of the Independent
Union was called for Thursday,
Oct. 31, by Robert Piedrahita.
president. The meeting was called
in order to elect officers and dis-
cuss plans for the revival of the
lon-dormant organization. About

49 persons, mostly freshmen, at-
tended.

‘The officers elected included Ed
Ihurcess, vice-president, George
Cviffin, secretary, and Peter Lin,

treasurer. The president, Robert
Piedrahita was elected in last
month's general election.

All the officers are cautiously
optimistic about the future of the
Union. Ed Burgess thinks the union
should “provide social, academic
and athletic activities to provide
an alternative to our present fra-
tcrnity system’. George Griffin
edded that the independent can
“make with it what he wants”.
Treasurer Lin sees a more impor-
tant priority. “Money is the main
factor, I think”, he said. “Once we
eet money. we can do other
things”.

Robert Piedrahita is thinking
more about the future right now
than he is the immediate prob-
ioms. He is disappointed that more
people did not show up for the
meetine but feels their absence is
po problem. He is expecting great-
er participation once the IU gets

rolling and, in the words of

George Griffin. “takes up the

slack the fraternities leave.”

Piedrahita’s goals for the group

include chess clubs, a literary soc-

iety, intramural participation.
and a political club. A team was

gathered for this week’s table
tennis intramurals, but it was or-
ganized too late to get on the
schedules.

A meeting of the officers was
on the agenda for last night to
discuss these goals and their pos-
sible implementation.

Student course survey released

By PAUL MORELLA
Phi Staff Reporter

The Student Curriculum Com-
mittee has released the results of
the curriculum survey conducted
last winter, which includes stu-
dent evaluations of most of the
courses offered in the winter
term,

The primary aim of the survey,

 

according to committee chair-
man Lawrence Lyles, is to pro-
vide an “aecurate, objective, and
constructive criticism of courses
and professors at W&L.” In addi-

“every effort has been made to
insure the accuracy of these re-

UC okays
long holiday
next winter

By BOB PUGH
Phi Staff Reporter

The 1975-76 calendar submit-
ted by the faculty executive com-
mittee was approved last Thurs-
day by the UC.

Upon final approval by the ad-
ministration the calendar will in-
crease the Washington holiday
to nine days next year and move
commencement back to June 3.
The spring vacation will come
later than presently, April 9-19.
The fall term will not be affected.

The UC also reviewed the stu-
dent health committee's report
that found most complaints in-
volved poor communications be-
tween the infirmary staff and
ailing students. Prof. John Mc-
Daniel said that many times stu-
dents fail to heed the physician's
instructions to check back.

There have also been problems
admitting students to the hospi-
tal emergency room, but these
are being ironed out, McDaniel
said.

Students having complaints
with this or any other infirmary
procedures should submit written
complaints to Dean Lewis John
or another health committee
member.

The UC also reviewed the stu-
dent affairs committee's report
and euidance memorandum for
student discipline. There was a
great deal of debate about W&L
authority over acts that merely
reflect on the university, like
misconduct away from Lexing-
ton

Some expressed the thought
that this was extending the uni-
versity's jurisdieation too far, in
that it governs the lives of stu-
denst when they are not directly
connected with the university.

Others argued that these acts
could reflect adversely upon the
university's image since the indi-
would be characterized
as W&L students. They also con-

“B”, and that is the highest per-
centage of any department for
such grades.

And, the politics department
gave the highest percentage of
“C” grades, as nearly four out of
every 10 grades in the depart-
ment last year were such grades.

The math department leads in
percentages of “D” and “FP”
grades, with 10 and nine per-
cent, respectively.

The percentages listed above
are percentages of total grades
given by a department, ie. 46
percent of all history grades last
year were grades of “B”.

DEAR TRAVELLER—I'm a freshman who got blackballed by every
fraternity—even the Sigma Chi's, God forbid. Anyway, the point is
that I'm an independent. Who is this Robert Tetrahedron guy and
what is the Independent Union?
(Signed) B. Bailey

DEAR B.—No, dummy, it's Piedrahita, not tetrahedron. There's a big
difference. One has four facets, the other is facetless. Anyway, Mr.
Piedrahita ‘or is it Tetrahedron...) is vice-president of the Inde-
pendent Union, as elected by the independents on campus a few
weeks ago. Which means that he is president.

It's really very simple. Last year's Independent Union hierarchy,
which captured second place in the National Apathy Week look-
alike contest (the first-place team didn't bother showing up), didn't
bother with elections as deemed in the Independent Union constitu-
tion. And we know what happens when elections are botched up—
that’s right, they go to the Executive Committee to be botched up
even more. And the EC held true to is form.

Anyway, the EC, having already done so much for the Independent
Union, continued. That majestically weird body then decided to sche-
dule independent elections itself, forgetting the point that there is

an Independent Union constitution which specifies how elections are

to be held. So the EC scheduled elections with all the vigorous cam-
paign regulations reminiscent of the election of officers in Miss
Gesell’s third year grade class at Waddell Elementary School. The
EC deemed that anybody could run—no petitions or anything like
that, Just tell the EC you want to run and they'll take care of it,

As it turned out, only one person wanted to run—for any of the
four offices—and that was Mr. Tetrahedron ‘or is it Piedrahita .

He ran for vice-president, and he did very well, too, capturing the
votes of 60 persons who haven't even the vaguest idea of what they
were voting for. He, of course, was elected vice-president.

Meantime, no-one had been elected president, so the EC elected
Piedrahita ‘or is it Tetrahedron .) 8 president. My only question
is, Why didn’t the EC also elect him as treasurer and secretary, too,
as long as nobody ran for those offices

So, that is the current situation. There now exists an Independent
Union which is actually supposed to care about something. My only
second question here is, how do you organize independents? It
would seem independents are independents because they are inde-
pedents, not groupies, Anyway, Tetrahedron ‘or is it Piedrahita .. .)
is now going to organize the independents, which is kind of like ask-
ing President Ford to say something that doesn’t have to be clarified.

clude military science (10%),

fine arts (17%), and languages

How can the anomolies from
the norm, as portrayed by the
higher percentage of high marks
in the fine arts, history, English,
and military science, for exam-
ple, or the higher percentage of
lower marks in economics and ac-
counting and administration, be
explained?

Certainly there are factors de-
termining the percentages of a
grade given by a department.
Some departments open a major-
ity of their courses to non-maj-
ors; this, it would seem, would
lower the percentage of of high
marks.

And the nature of the courses
is important. Certainly an intern-
ship or a like course deserves a
grading system different from
that of the norm of the univer-
sity. One example here is total

A man of God

visits campus

ty TRAVELER

Speaking to a crowd of between
150-153 abject sinners, Calvin
Wendell made his first appear-
ance on campus Monday spread-
ing the “good news,” (no, Dean
John did not burn his red knit
sportcoat). Calvin spoke of God
as one who had his own personal
hotline keeping him in touch with
his Source.

Calvin came to Lexington to
speak on the court house green
and ended up preaching on the
W&L lawn. This was not Calvin's
first visit to Lexington but it
could be said that it was his most
successful visit to date. The last
time he came here the city fath-
ers denied him permission to
spread the word of God.

Among the talents demonstrat-
ed by this wandering latter day
saint was an extraordinary abil-
ity to captivate his audience with
his voice. Most of the hymns he
sung were practically beyond the
understanding of any man rid-
died with sin and vice-conse-
quently no one on campus under-
stood them. His teachings were
basic and fundamental—that old
time religion.

It has been pointed out that
the crowd attracted to the front
lawn by his spectacle was larger
than any assembled since the
riots of the late sixties. Unfor-
tunately the enthusiasm of the
student listeners was not enough

to keep Murph’s second, Herman
Huffman, from telling the old
preacher that he had to leave.
Reluctantly Calvin withdrew but
not before he told several inter-
ested students how he was called
to God.

LETTERS TQ THE COITOR

Chapel services—
completely unnecessary

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

As a former W&L student and
resident of Lexington for a num-
ber of years, it was with inter-
est that I read recently a letter
to you suggesting that worship
services be held in Lee Chapel.
What nonsense!

Robert E. Lee, as a military
man of some fame, turned to
peaceful pursuits only upon de-
feat. Why make a cult of his
memory? Second, why isn't one
chureh ‘Grace Church, or R. E.
Lee Episcopal, as it is commonly
called) on campus sufficient?
Third, and perhaps most impor-
tant, what about Jesus Christ's
injunction to his followers to go
into their “inner storerooms”
and closets to pray, rather than
holding public services including
prayer?

Soccer falls to .500 after

Generals’ offense absent
as Lynx roll, 32-0

By BILL KLESHER
Phi Sports editor

As Washington and Lee's foot-
ball team boarded their charter
flight from Memphis to Roanoke
Saturday evening, one of the ste-
wardesses, in a very hostesslike
manner, asked W&L head coach
Bill McHenry how the Generals’
game with Southwestern went.

“Rotten! Terrible!” was the
coach’s only reply.

The stewardess apologized for
asking.

Unfortunately, the adjectives
McHenry used in his answer
closely described the Generals’
performance Saturday, as a stin-
gy Southwestern defense and sev-
eral key W&L mistakes led to a
32-0 drubbing for the Generals,
who again failed to win a foot-
ball game on the road.

The last time W&L emerged
victorious away from Wilson
Field was in 1971, when they
downed Washington (Mo.) Uni-
versity. Since then the Generals
have come close several times,
but have never found the winning
combination.

Against Southwestern,
didn’t even come close.

The Generals’ usually potent
offense was held to 106 total
yards by a Lynx defense that had
allowed only eight touchdowns
on the year. All but two of those
yards came through the air. And,
even upstairs, W&L found little
success.

they

Quarterback Jack Berry hit on
only six of 17 passes for 104 yards.
Two of his aerials were picked
off, as were two other passes, one
by freshman quarterback Don
Smith, the other by Tony Perry
on an end-around option pass.

Southwestern defensive back
Conrad Bradburn assumed the
villian’s role by intercepting two
of those passes, as well as scoring
two of the Lynx’s touchdowns,
one on a 63-yard punt return, the

other on a 66-yard kickoff return
following a safety against the
Generals early in the final per-
iod.

Bradburn had a third return
into the end zone called back by
a clipping penalty in the first
quarter, The junior defensive
back also broke up several passes
to round out what he called his
“finest football game ever.”

The Generals also had a six-
pointer called back in the open-
ing minutes on a very question-
able call. On fourth and six from
the Southwestern 34, Berry called
the end-around option play, with
Perry coming from his left end
position, taking a pitch from the
quarterback, and then either
running with or throwing the
ball.

As it was, the Lynx defense all
came up for the run, leaving wide
receiver Mark George wide open
in the end zone. Perry’s pass was
on target, and it appeared W&L
had taken a 6-0 lead.

But back upfield, the field
judge, after the ball had reached
George in the end zone, threw a
flag toward the Generals’ inter-
ior linemen. He called an inelig-
ible receiver down field penalty,
and W&L lost their six points.

From there on, the game be-
longed to the homestanding
Lynx. Southwestern took a 10-0
lead at halftime as quarterback
Mike Hanna hit Rik Talley with
a 60-yard scoring pass, and Phil
Mulkey connected on a 31-yard
field goal, as well as the extra
point.

W&L took the second half kick-
off, but could move nowhere, and
was forced to punt. Bradburn
took a low kick in full stride at
the 37-yard line, and ran right
through the W&L defenders to
the end zone. Mulkey’s kick made
it 17-0.

4-1 loss to

By SANDY BISHOP
Phi Sports Reporter

Showing little hustle and even
less offense, Washington and
Lee's soccer team fell to Gettys-
burg (Pa.) College, 4-1, Saturday,
in the Generals’ home finale for
1974.

The loss dropped W&L to 4-4-2
on the year after a 2-0 win over
Roanoke College earlier in the
week had upped the team’s re-
cord above .500 for the first time
since early in the year.

Jim Fox scored both W&L goals
against Roanoke, while goalie
Paul Devine had little trouble in
recording his second shutout of
the year. The Generals saw many
scoring chances go by as poor
shooting cost them several goals.

Against Gettysburg the Gen-
erals saw a three-game win
streak snapped as defensive let-

Washington and Lee's cross-
country team finished its dual
meet season dropping a double-
dual meet to Eastern Mennonite
College, 20-36, and Madison Col-
lege, 20-29, on Saturday.

Tem Washington, led W&L
runners across the finish line,
placing sixth in a field of 27 with
a 28:24 time over the five-mile
course. Jim McMenamin was the
only other General in the top ten

John Embree scored the lone
W&L goal, which at the time cut
the Gettysburg lead to 2-1. But
the visitors moved on to add
two goals late in the game.

W&L needed a win in Tues-
day’s game against VMI to keep
any chances of a winning season
alive. The Generals travel to An-
napolis, Md. on Saturday to play
nationally-ranked Navy in their

THE RING-TUM PHI

Sek.

Believe it or not, Washington and Lee’s football team is serious
about what they do, despite what this picture might indicate.
Phi photographer Bill Robinson snapped this shot on “Hat Day”
before the Generals grabbed their first win of the season over
Sewanee. Maybe it had something to do with the outcome, as no
“Hat Day” has been held before any other Generals game this
year. W&L hosts Denison Saturday at 1:30 p.m.

PKS leads

Law II

in I-M standings

By the Phi Sports Staff

After beating defending overall
champion Law II in both the
football and cross-country finals,
Phi Kappa Sigma has grabbed
the early lead in the race for the
1974-75 W&L Intramural Cham-
pionship.

PKS leads Law II by eight
points, 332-324, after four sports.
Pi Kappa Alpha is third with 314
points, followed by Sigma Alpha
Epsilon with 290, and Lambda
Chi Alpha with 258 points.

PKS grabbed the football
crown by rallying from a 6-0
halftime defecit to record a 12-6
upset win over a heavily favored

Law IJ team. Freshman Ben
Johns twice grabbed touchdown
passes for PKS, who broke the
seven year domination of the I-M
gridiron by the Law School and
Delta Tau Delta.

PKS edged Law II for the cross
country crown, 13-14. Sigma Chi
freshman Mark Hampton led the
58 runners over the 2.75 mile
“Turkey Trot” with a time of
14:09.

Led by Tom Schmutz, Law II
took the tennis title, beating Phi
Delta Theta in the finals, 3-0.

Pi Kapa Alpha won the golf
crown by edging SAE, 118 to 121,
in the medal play finals.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Generals fall, 32-0

(Continued from page 3)

On the following W&L series
Bradburn again popped up to
pick off a Berry pass, seting up
the Lynx’ third touch down,a one-
yard sneak by Hanna. The kick
failed, leaving Southwestern with
a 23-0 lead after three quarters.

The Lynx got their final nine
points within 12 seconds in the
fourth quarter. A clipping pen-
ulty on a punt gave W&L the ball
ot their own two-yard line. Three
plays later, Smith, who had re-
placed Berry at quarterback,
tried to run the ball out from the
shadows of the goalposts.

But linebacker Jon Crowder
got to Smith before he could get
out of the end zone, and the Gen-
erals for the second time on the
year were victims of a safety.

On the following free kick,
Bradburn, after taking the ball
at the 34, displayed some fine
open field running as well as some
heads-up play by using his block-
ers well to score his second touch-
down of the game. Mulkey’s kick
was good, and Southwestern had
put the game away.

W&L had a chance to score late
in the game, moving the ball to
the Lynx 8, but a blitzing Crowd-
cr threw Berry for a 13-yard loss,
taking the Generals out of scor-
ing range.

The final outcome marked the
Lirst time since the Sewanee game
of 1973 (31-0) that W&L had
gone scoreless.

The Generals will again be put
to a severe test on Saturday when
the Big Red from Denison Uni-
versity invade Lexington. Deni-
son has trounced W&L the last
two years by scores of 52-22 in

1972, and 49-29 in 1973.

they were more specific. Also,
this was the first time that
class time was used to answer the
questions.”

As of right now, however, only
one copy of the results is avail-
able for student use. It is cur-
rently located in the library. “It
would be nice to have handbooks
printed up with these results,”
Lyles stated,” but this entails
more money and time than we
have available at the moment.

“In addition,’ he continued,
“we are looking for feedback be-
cause the success of this survey
and future surveys depends on
the faculty and students.”

(Continued from Page 2)

Calvin told the story that he
was called fourteen years ago to
witness for the Lord and become
a street preacher. He is from
Winchester, Virginia, and claim-
ed to be in route home unless the
spirit moved him to speak. Cal-
vin says he has preached all over
the country and has recently re-
turned from a tour of the plains
of the Midwest where one of the
Old Testament prophets was re-
vealed to him in a heavenly vi-
sion. Calvin declined to disclose
the name of the prophet he saw
as that was confidential informa-
tion.

case, the student. It can be argu-
ed that history is downright easy,
or that politics is downright hard,
just by looking at a breakdown
of grading by department. Then
another student can come along
and say that history is hard and
politics is easy, if you take into
account such-and-such factors.

What's the easiest department
in the school? The facts for that
answer are on this page in black
and white. The answer itself is
not.

And, there's distribution. Cer-
tainly, a large number of fresh-
men and sophomores take mathe-
matics to satisfy Division 3 of the
distribution requirements (the di-
vision includes math and the
physical sciences). Many stu-
dents don’t want to take any
math or science, but they have
to. This would bring down grades
in some departments.

The determination of which
departments are “easy” and
which are “difficult”, then, lies
in the eyes of the beholder in this
