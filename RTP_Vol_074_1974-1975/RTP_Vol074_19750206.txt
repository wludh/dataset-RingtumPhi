E.C. seeks end to rules
for academic probation

By JOL FITZGERALD

The Executive Committee voted
Monday night to recommened to
the Faculty E.C. that all re-
strictions on activities for stu-
dents on academic probation be
removed. The vote was six to four
with one member abstaining and
one absent.

The vote was only a suggestion
and not binding on the F.E.C.
The F.E.C. had asked for input
from the E.C. as well as the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. The vote
will be reported at next week’s
F.E.C. meeting.

The motion to suggest no re-
strictions was put forth by E.C.
members Steve Robinson who
argued that “if you’re old enough
to go to college, you’re old enough
to handle your academic career.”
The four members who voted
againts the proposal agreed with
Everett Martin that “you need
some safeguard” against students
in elected positions ignoring their
responsibilities in trying to raise

their grades.

The present rules state that a
student may engage in only one
activity when he is on academic
probation, and must resign any
elective ov appointive office. Vice-
president Bob Keatley suggested
that if the F.E.C. heeded the sug-
gestion from the E.C. the E.c.
could pass their own rule con-
cerning members who shirked
duties to study.

In other business, the E.C.
heard from John Killpack of the
Student Activities Board concern-
ing more changes in Fancy Dress.
The beverage served at the Ball
on Friday night, Feb. 21, will
be beer instead of the Champale
announced earlier. In addition,
coat and tie will be minimum
dress for the event, but no khakis
or denim will be allowed.

The E.C. also held a meeting
Tuesday night to consider pro-
posals for change in the Honor
System. Although the public

An analysis

for needy

William Sturges, president of
the University Federation, said
that in his opinion the mixer,
held in Evans Dining Hall, was
extremely successful and that
everyone appeared to be having a
good time, whether mingling
with the imports from down the
road or indulging in liquid re-
freshments.

The money raised by the event
will be used to aid the Rockbridge
Area Relief Association, the local
Welfare office, and the Lexington
Boys Club. Clothes will be bought
with the proceeds, foster homes
will be supported, and the gen-
eral fund of the Boys Club will be
augmented.

“Staircase,” the band from
Durham which played at the
mixer, seemed to be well receiv-
ed. The thirteen kegs of beer that
were available were also appreci-
ated by all who chose to try them.
5775 was spent on the affair, with
support from the Federation, the

ago failed due to lack of attend-
ance, the members of the E.C.
felt that good returns on their
survey sheets justified looking in-
to possible revisions.

Ideas from the E.C. and from
the public were heard and a list
of proposals from the advisors
at the last public trial was pre-

sented. The list included such '

thoughts as setting up a special
honor council seperate from the
E.C. to deal solely in honor hear-
ings, and banning members of

this council from attending pub- —
lic trials or talking to the jurors ©
on anything other than pro-

cedural matters.

The E.C. plans to devote next
week’s regular meeting, Monday
night at 7:00 p.m., to discussion
and possible vote on the ques-
tion of whether an adversary sys-
tem should be set up for public
trials. Steve Robinson is to write
a recommendation for an inde-
pendent prosecutor and Leland
McCullough and Everett Martin
are to write an argument in
favor of a prosecutor from the
EC.

The other areas under review
by the E.C. include: jury selec-
tion; the possibility of holding
appeals in private instead of the
present public hearing; the pen-
alties for honor violations and
whether the absolute penalty of
expulsion should be applied in
all cases; whether some bound-
aries for application of the Honor
System should be set; and,
whether any change should be
made in the procedure for nota-
tions of honor trials on a stu-
dent's record.

Trustees welcome student input

By the Phi News Staff

In its annual mid-winter meet-
ing the University’s Board of
Trustees voted to grant permis-
sion to the student body and
alumni association presidents to
attend Board committee meet-
ings.

Student and alumni presidents
previously have attended the
Board of Trustees meetings with
full privileges of discussion and
now with an invitation from the
president or rector the same

privileges
meetings.

President Huntley said the pur-
pose of the action is to increase
feedback coming from the stu-
dent and alumni interests. This
action applies to the Finance,
Development, Executive, and No-
minating Committees.

Just as in Board meetings, vot-
ing privileges or participation in
executive sessions is not extend-
ed to the student or alumni presi-

Ethics program begins this year

BY STEVE YEVICH

Phi Feature Editor

Ed. note—The following is the
first of two articles dealing with
Washington and Lee’s erperi-
mental ethics program. The
concluding segment will appear
in the nezt issue of the Ring-
tum Phi.

With funding from the Lilly
Foundation, Washington and Lee
has embarked upon an innovative
program of studies in applied
ethies in the fields of law, medi-
cine and journalism.

Under the direction of Dr.

22

 

Louis W. Hodges, professor of
religion, the program has been
designed to expose pre-profes-
sional undergraduates to the
complexities of the ethical
choices that they will be con-
fronted with in their chosen
felds.

According to Dr. Hodges, the
principal goal of the program,
entitled “Society and the Profes-
sions,” is to examine the way in
which the three fields individu-
ally affect society, and to pro-
vide specific. systematic atten-
tion to pressing questions of
human values pertaining to these

Dr. Norman Isaacs

professions, thereby sharpening
the undergraduate’s perception
of his own fields.

The main emphasis is placed
on the class seminars, which are
conducted annually in each of
the three fields. These seminars
are “specifically designed for
seniors who have a reasonable
expectation of entering a career
in journalism, law or medicine,”
says Dr. Hodges. Written reports
prepared by individual students
are the primary focus in each
seminar session; each report is
discussed, its proposals debated,
and its merits analyzed.

The courses are listed in the
300 level of the Interdepart-
mental section of the university
catalogue, as each (with the cur-
rent exception of the medical
ethics course) is team taught by
professors from various depart-
ments. This term Dr. Hodges
and Prorf. MacDonald are teach-
ing Ethies of Journalism, while
Hodees. President Huntley and
Dr. Lowry conduct the course on
law ethies. Dr. Hodges alone will
lead the medical ethics course in
the spring term

The structure of the program
is three-pronged: students en-
roll in the seminars, participate
in & “continuing education” pro-
fram, and attend two public lec-
tures pertaining to the course,
presented by professionals na-
Honally prominent in their re-
spective flelds.

Each year two scholars in each
of the three areas of concern
will be invited to deliver an ad-
dress on applied ethics They
Will also remain on campus for

several days, sitting in on class
sessions and engaging in discus-
sions with the students. Their
formal remarks will be bound
together, published, and distri-
buted to interested alumni and
members of the public. Thus it
appears that something of benefit
to the whole profession will de-
velop from the program.

One of these lectures, Dr.
Norman Isaacs, Associate Dean
of the School of Journalism at
Columbia University, was in Lex-
ington last week in conjunction
with the journalism course; his
address dealt with the future of
ethics in that field. Isaacs seemed
quite concerned about the Ameri-
ean tendency to elevate the dol-
lar bill to “number-one god in
the pantheon of values,” with its
resulting implications on the
field of journalism. He is alarmed
by the spreading trend toward
coporate control and collecti-
Vizaltion of newspapers, stifling
their freedom of thought and ex-
pression. What is needed most
is a journalistic code of ethics,
in Isaacs’ opinion, on which
would guarantee thruthfulness,
responsibility. accuracy, impar-
tiality, and the precedence of
the public right to know over
public curiosity in the guise of
a right.

Concerning the continuing
education symposia, Dr. Hodges
has written in his brochure on
the program: “In each of the
three fields, we expect to bring
ten practicing professionais to
campus for a four or five day
period of study. They are to meet

(Continued on page 4)

 

 

 

 

 

In the same meeting much
time was devoted to finance mat-
ters. Treasurer James White-
head told the Trustees that the
university will not exceed the
budget set for 1974-75.

Farris Hotchkiss, development
director, reported to the Trustees
that of the $36 million 1976 goal,
about 75° has not been commit-
ted to program objectives. He also
said the present alumni dona-
tions are up $44,000 over the
same time last year.

winter, and spring, with the win-
ter meeting traditionally held

\ REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

Academic probation

Last Monday the Executive Committee voted by a narrow
margin to recommend that the faculty abolish rules governing
the extracurricular activities open to students placed on aca-
demic probation. As it now stands, a student placed on
academic probation may only participate in one extracurricular
activity. If a student fails to retain a grade-point average of
at least 2.00, he may not run or retain certain campus offices.
These offices include the Executive Committee, University
Council, the chairmen of committees, the editors and business
managers of the publications on campus, the managing editor of
The Ring-tum Phi, class presidents, president of the Uni-
versity Theatre, and the president and vice president of the
Interfraternity Council.

We believe that the Executive Committee should not have
recommended that all these rules be discontinued. Certainly
the University does not want to be overly protective of its
students, but some requirements should be kept. Perhaps a
student on academic probation should not be limited to a
single extracurricular activity by the faculty. Such a limita-
tion probably does very little if anything to force the student
to study more.

On the other hand, a student in academic difficulty prob-
ably cannot fully meet his responsibility to the student body
as a member of the EC or as editor of a student publication.
Some requirements should be placed upon students in posi-
tions of leadership. We feel that at least some means should
be found to insure that members of the student government
and heads of campus organizations are at least able, if not
willing, to meet their responsibilities to their peers.

A gift for the students

Before the time passes us by completely we would like to
acknowledge the exceedingly generous gift of Miss Ruth
Parmly to the school. Her recent contribution of $1.5 million
to the endowment is certainly appreciated by those who fully
realize W&L’s needs.

Too often students feel that a gift to the school is of small
importance to them, They see the President and other Uni-
versity officials working toward and achieving goals for W&L
and feel somewhat left out. Although it may seem at times as
though a gift was made to the President or another adminis-
trator, this is not the case. All gifts are given to serve the
students’ needs directly or indirectly. It is the student body
which profits the most from donations made to the institution.

Again we wish to thank Miss Parmly for her generosity
to Washington and Lee and hope that the student body will
be fully aware of who the actual recipient is.

What happened
to fancy dress?

The formal dress requirement for Fancy Dress has been
dropped. The requirement that students wear at least a suit
to Fancy Dress has also fallen by the wayside. We are afraid
that the students, in their desire not to appear overdressed,
may institute a new requirement of blue jeans and T-shirts
only.

Last week the Student Activities Board was forced to
change the dress requirement for the Fancy Ball.
Apparently certain groups of students threatened to boycott
the festivities if they were forced to wear either a tuxedo or
a suit. To them, wearing anything more formal than a dirty
shirt and work pants appeared as a fate worse than death, If
this is true, we wonder what they plan to be buried in—long
underwear?

| dress

The Student Activities Board has put a great deal of work
into Fancy Dress which should be something special this year.
We regret that students do not seem to be “in the mood” to
go to any trouble for Faney Dress, Certainly the expense of
renting a tuxedo at $11 is not exorbitant. Perhaps this problem
could be avoided in the future if the Admissions Office re-
quired that entering freshmen own their own formal wear,

We hope that the students will reconsider their decision
to insist that they not be required to wear, at the very least,
suits. Learning to deny themselves the indulgence of informa!
if not slovenly appearance might just prove more enjoyable
than they think.

DEAR 'TRAVELLER—I know W&L has had many distinguished men
graduated from among its students, like Roger Mudd from the
undergraduate liberal arts program, and Justice Powell and Doug
Schwartz from the law school. But I can’t for the life of me
think of any alumns who were graduated from the school’s fine
arts program.

(Signed) D. Schwartz

DEAR D.—So?

DEAR TRAVELLER—Name some,, stupid.

DEAR D.—Oh, I get it. Hmmmm. There’s so many alumni from the
fine arts, it’s hard to find a spot to begin. How about a list of
those who stick out in my mind like a magenta crayon in a box
of Crayolas?

—Benjie “Monotone” Skittleton—B.A. in music, 1965. Gained
worldwide notoriety for senior thesis, “Finding a lost chord.”
Has performed many times for the Cleveland Symphonie as a
bass drum. Now attending graduate school in Pomona, Cailif.,
with an F sharp major and an A flat minor. Likes to set faculty
meeting transcripts to music.

—Shirley ‘‘Too Loose”’ LaTruck—B.A. in art (Hollins), 1970.
First exchange student to take up fine arts at W&L. Known for her
work “Sigma Chi bedroom ceiling, as seen while on my back, 1969.”’
Specializes in finger painting, and now serves as adviser to W&L’'s
current fine arts program.

—Irv “Soft-stroke’ Baneskowicz—B.A. in art, 1971. First
W&L exchange student to take up fine arts at Hollins. Known for
his work, “Tinker Dorm bedroom ceiling, as seen while on my
back, 1970.” Likes raspberry ice cream cones.

—Freddy “Look-like-a-tree” Spamatolini—B.A. in drama,
1945. Talented broadway actor, best known for his title role in
“Hair.”

—Ingmar Stetson, Jr—B.A. in Interdepartmental, 1967.
Famed muralist. Best known locally for inspiring creation,
“Bricks,” painted on the side of new Doremus Gym.

—Adlewar Laguna—B.A. in art, 1956. Best known locally for
his sculpture work often seen in front of duPont Hall. Currently
runs junkyard in Staunton.

DEAR TRAVELLER—Will somebody tell those idiots running Fancy
Dress that I still have my scarecrow costume that I bought for
last year’s ball before the theme was changed from “The Wizard
of Oz?”

(Signed) M. Brittin

DEAR M.—Fret not. “Oz” is rumored to be next year’s theme. SAB
Chairman John Killpack said he tried for the theme again next
year, but he couldn't get Southern Sem to agree to provide the
wicked witches. He also said everything was set until he found
out Dorothy was dead.

‘Lion in Winter’ shows
a problem of

By BARNEY SKELTON
Phi Entertainment Editor

The problem one encounters in
the University Theatre produc-
tion of “The Lion in Winter” is
ultimately one of direction. This
is true not only in the sense that
Dave DeChristopher, as director,
errs in certain areas of his re-
sponsibility, but also in the sense
(and this is perhaps a corollary
to the first) that the play lacks
direction in terms of where it
lead us—i.e., what is it about
these characters that ineffably
remains true at the end of the
performance.

Were it not for the buoying ef-
fect of Mr. Minton’'s superb por-
trayal of King Henry, and for the
consistent renditions turned in by
Messrs. Winzeler, Scott, and
Overton as the sons of the King,
this question would remain quite
an enigma.

In reference to the first genre
of the “direction” difficulties, it
is clear that the play, at least in
one obvious instance, was mis-
cast. Although one must pay due
respect to Tama Natkin, a Lex-
ington High School student, for
taking on the role of Alais, it was
patently clear that she was out of
her league. Alais is the “pawn”
among all of the power mongers
of the past, and is, thus, neces-
sarily a rather pathetic figure.
Miss Natkin’s gooey, pleading,
monotone which never broke
stride for the duration of her
stage presence, however, while
merely a testimony to her inex-
perience, was the death of any
pacing which would develop prior
to her entrances.

As is usually the case when one
actor is dragging, the cast eith-
er would descend to the pace she

was setting, or strain themselves
in the attempt to fill up the gap
she was creating. This gap, fur-
thermore, was often extremely
pronounced owing to the fact
that there were so Many scenes
in which she had to play opposite
Henry—at each of those points,
the aforementioned gap enlarged
into a gulf due to the consum-
mately powerful performance
Mr. Minton achieved.

In the final analysis though,
who is to blame for this inconsis-
tency of ability among the mem-
bers of the cast? One fears that
the Fickle Finger of Fate must
point to our director. Although it
is true that directors often gam-
ble giving new or inex
actors a chance on the stage, it
would seem that Mr. DeChristo-
pher was betting against the odds
in choosing Miss Natkin—in do-
ine so, he was much more unfair
to her than to anyone else.

With respect to other aspects
of Mr. DeChristopher’s directing,
one finds three objections. First
of all, in terms of the blocking, it
was quite often the case that ac-
tors were delivering the lines
with their backs to the audience.
Now, of course, in some cases this
was unavoidable, but in several
instances it was unnecessary and
annoying .

Secondly, what on earth was
that music between scenes all
about? It was bad enough that
there had to be so many scene
changes to disrupt the action, but
the music, which is usually a
means to smooth the transition
between scenes, was disruptive,
superfluous, and downright cam-
py. OK, so you're producing a
“satiric’ Lion in Winter,” you
don't have to ram it down our
throats!

direction

Finally, and this is actually Mr.
Romanchuk’s responsibility as
designer, the set was high-school-
ish. Rather than achieve the goal
of a “suggestive” set, the result
was inadequate and distracting
even given the limitations of the
University Theatre facilities.

Before going into the other
“direction” problem, it would be
well to discuss what was good
about the play, for there were
some excellent performances.

As stated before, Henry was
just what he should have been.
Mr. Minton captured both the
vitality of the man who was the
most powerful king in Europe and
the contemplative dejection of a
great man grown old. Indeed, as
he did in the Europe of 1183, he
did in the Troub Theatre in 1975
—Henry carried the day.

As Mr. DeChristopher intimat-
ed in last week's Ring-tum Phi,
“Lion in Winter” is basically a
character study, and the only
other actors who lived up to their
responsibility in the full were the
three sons. Mr. Overton, in his
stage debut, captured the cool
calculating Geoffrey to the tee.
He had just the sneering look
about him that one would expect
Geoffrey to have. Mr. Winzeler,
as the pimply-faced John, was
hilarious. Boyish, pouting, impo-
tent, ineffective and stupid, John
is vital to the humor of the play
and these qualities Mr. Winzeler
seemed to have no problem in

dealing with. Proud and arro-
gant Richard received an able
representation by Mr. Scott. of
the three brothers, Richard is the
most difficult to deal with as a
character, and Mr. Scott was
perfectly suited to the role.

The other “direction” problem
arises when one focuses one’s at-
tention to the portrayal of Elea-
nor by Miss Wilson, and Philip
by Mr. Hogle. In both cases the
actors failed to grasp the essence
of their characters. Miss Wilson,
while conveying well the wistful-
ness and sardonic wit of the cap-
tive queen, somehow missed the
piercing and dynamic intelli-
gence which Eleanor certainly
possessed.

Mr. Hogles leaves it unclear
whether Philip's reasons for
luring Richard into his room,
and subsequent seduction of him,
are amatory or political, The
script suggests the latter — Mr.
Hogle, the former.

Despite the unevenness of cer-
tain individual performances and
the directional problems, the play
is entertaining and, by all means,
worthwhile. The seript is rich in
humor and sarcasm, and as stat-
ed before the excellent perfor-
mance by Mr. Minton truly is a
show in itself.

Swimmers
8-2; state

meet next

While freestylers John Hudson
and Tad Van Leer kept on win-
ning, Washington and Lee’s
swimmers showed some newfound
depth to record a 59-54 dual meet
win over William and Mary in
Williamsburg Saturday.

The Generals, now 8-2 on the
year, won the first five events
of the meet, and staved off a
late charge by the Indians when
Hudson and Bill Tiers finished
1-2 in the 550-yard freestyle.

Hudson had already picked up
wins in the 1000- and 200-yard
freestyles.

Van Leer scored a triple with
a win in the 50, a tie for first
in the 100, and the anchor leg
on W&L’s winning medley relay.

W&L’s other win came from
Rod Scott in the 200-yard indi-
vidual medley.

W&L coach Bill Sterns called
the medley relay win “the key
to the meet.” Stearns said that
if William and Mary had gone
with their top swimmers in the
relay, it would have been much
tougher for W&L to win.

Stearns also said that the Gen-
erals got several second and third
place finishes that helped in the
win. Junior John Henzel picked
up a key second in the 200-yard
backstroke, while senior Dick
Barber was second in both the 50
and the required diving.

The Generals hosted VMI last
evening.

ming over the Washington Holi-

Wrestling Generals lost to VMI,

Washington and Lee wrestlers
stumbled through a nightmarish
week, winning only two matches
in a 31-9 loss to Virginia Military,

Only Brian Tray (142) and
Jim Crytzer (158) posted wins
for the Generals against VMI.
Crytzer picked up a pin in the
second period.

Slumping Generals drop
2 of 3; ODU here tonight

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

Unless Washington and Lee’s
roundballers find the magic
combination that sparked their
surge to win after win early in
the season, the rest of the 1974-
75 campaign could be a real
struggle.

The Generals hit the skids for
the first time last week, dropping
a pair of games on the road to
York (Pa.) College, 78-63, and
Bowie State (Md.) College, 66-
57, while barely escaping with a
69-68 win over Kean (N.J.) Col-
lege earlier in the week.

The two losses dropped W&L’s
season record to 13-5, and, with
nationally-ranked Old Dominion
and Randolph-Macon as well as
defending VCAA champion
Madison left on the schedule, the
Generals’ hope for a 20-win sea-
son and a NCAA tournament bid
might have been left somewhere
along I-81.

The week in review:

a * *

If it hadn't been for some un-
canny foul shooting by Greg
Croghan and John Podgajny,
Tuesday, the Generals’ current
losing streak might be four in-
stead of just two.

W&L hit 23 of 27 from the
charity stripe against Kear, in-
cluding 12 for 12 by Croghan
and four for four by Podgajny,
who hit both ends of a one-and-
one with four seconds left to put
the game out of reach.

The Generals suffered another
cold shooting night, as only
Podgajny, who finished with 20
points, was anywhere near 50
percent from the floor.

As a result of W&L’s poor
shooting, visiting Kean (nee
Newark State) was able to stay
close throughout the game.

Though the Generals led most
of the way, they could never open
up more than a nine-point lead
despite several Kean turnovers in

the second half which presented
W&L a chance to break the game
wide open.

The Generals fritted away a
seven-point lead late in the game,
but the clutch foul shooting of
Croghan and Podgajny saved the
win.

Croghan, who had been on a
scoring tear, ended with a sea-
son high 22 points, while adding
9 rebounds.

* * *

The Genearls’ slump continued
as they traveled north for a pair
of games with York and Bowie
State.

A year ago both teams were
victims of W&L as the Generals
rallied late in the season to give
head coach Verne Canfliield his
eighth straight winning season.

This time W&L went into the
weekend assured of an above
500 campaign, as the win over
Kean gave W&L the thirteenth
win needed for a winning season.

This time around, it was W&L
who filled the victim’s shoes.

The Generals played their
sloppiest basketball of the sea-
son, showing no offense and not
much more defense while their
opponents came up with their
best games of the season.

W&L led York by as many as
eight points early in, the game,
only to watch in seeming dis-
belief as the host Spartans came
back to grab a 36-32 halftime
lead.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Phi Beta Kappa selects members

sy BILL THOMPSON

Phi Beta Kappa _ recently
selected 18 seniors and 7 juniors
for admission in the Washing-
ton and Lee chapter to honor
them for scholastic achievement
and for their contributions to
the college community.

With this group two faculty
members, Dr. Shillington and
Dr. Spencer, were spotlighted
with honorary memberships in
the organization; these honor-
ary appointments were extra-
ordinary and the two that re-
ceived them were carefully con-
sidered by the chapter member-
ship.

Phi Beta Kappa annually hon-
ors individuals of high academic
standing and integrity; however
this year fewer students were
selected for the organization
partly due to a newly-established
higher grade “cut-off” point.

Despite the fact that there is
no set GPA for admission, there
is an undisclosed cut-off point
for consideration to the group
which varies from year to year.

Dr. DeVogt, president of the
local chapter, revealed that the
now-prevailing grade inflation—
largely a result of the university’s
relaxed poliy of a 1-12-6 credit
load system—put more students
into the consideration category
than before and that an “‘infla-
tion-proof measure” was deemed
necessary by the group to keep
membership at the desired level.
This measure was a higher “cut-
off’ point for seniors grades so
that only the usual 10 percent
of the senior class could be ad-
mited this year. (Juniors must
have at least a 3.5 average to be
considered for admission.) No
more than 15 percent of the class
can ever be admitted, according

regularly with the undergradu-
ates and thus provide the class
that experience in decision-mak-
ing that the undergraduate lacks.
We believe the undergraduate
can provide for the professionals
an important measure of fresh-
ness and inquisitiveness that is
so necessary for ethically con-
scious decision-making.”

Prof. MacDonald says that
these sessions will give the pro-
fessionals a chance “‘to sit down
and cogitate about ethics and
their fields—-they will be given
a few days to just think...
We are bringing them here not
as resource people; we are ex-
pecting to give ideas to them,
not them to us.”

Besides looking into the pros-
pects and complications of
formulating a journalistic code
of ethics, the question of the
social responsibility of the press
and broadcast media will be
debated by the eleven students

in the second half for W&L, as
York continued to capitalize on
the Generals’ errors and pull
away to a big lead.

Tony Fannick, one of four
junior college transfers which
have given a big boost to York's
basketball hopes (ast season
they went 1-22). led the Spartans
with 21 points.

Croghan again led W&L with
18 points.

The Generals outrebounded
their shorter opponents, 54-33,
but shot only 35 percent from the
floor, which is where too many
games are decided for W&L.

Bowie State put the Generals
to sleep with a four-corner type
slowdown offense, and, by the
time W&L woke up, they were too
far behind to catch up.

The Bulldogs crawled to a 23-
12 halftime lead as their delib-
erate play on offense seemingly
caused W&L to forget how to put
the ball in the basket.

The Generals hit on only six

for example, should items be
judged as newsworthy or not?
Who should control the dis-
semination of those items that

the communications media,
which in essense perform a vital
public service, be under the con-
trol of private individuals or
corporations? How can the free-
doms guaranteed by the First
Amendment be preserved, while
providing a balance to excessive
press criticism?

Prof. MacDonald feels that the
course in applied ethics in journ-
alism is a quite valid addition to
the curriculum. “There has been
tremendous development of
journalism ethics in the last
several years, with Watergate
making a big influence,” says
MacDonald, “and the press, be-
ing as introspective an institu-
tion as it is, needs a good out-
side evaluation.”

the case against York, W&L

The Bulldogs upped their lead

through the half, then stopped
a furious rally attempt by the
Generals with good foul shooting
down the stretch.

Four Bowie State players

to the by-laws.

The decision to raise the cut-
off point was reached by the
faculty and membership of the
chapter with a secret ballot vote.
The system, according to Dr.
DeVogt, is an imperfect one but
so far the Executive Committee
has come up with no better sug-
gestions. The by-laws of the
group are very flexible in most
areas and the membership has
the deciding vote in regulating
the organization in many cases.
A combination of variable in-
fluences the organization’s poli-
cies and, as a consequence, the
selection of new members. Ap-
parently regulatory legislation
was necessary, as Dr. DeVogt can
illustrate. He has been here for
13 years; in his first years at
W&L only 5-6 percent of the
senior class was admitted an-
nually. Recently, specifically in
the past two years, over 10 per-
cent of the class has been ad-
mitted.

The following students have
been elected to membership in

Procter & Gamble
Brand Management

It’s One of the Finest Career
Opportunities Available Anywhere

bd Gow Litt Med te MEAL

Procter & Gamble manufactures more than 50 consumer products,
including Crest toothpaste, Duncan Hines cake mixes, Tide detergent,
Pampers disposable diapers, Scope mouthwash and many others
whose names you would recognize just as easily.
For each product, there is a small group, usually just 3 people, who
plan, create, and supervise the total consumer marketing effort —
including TV advertising — for that brand. It’s called Brand Manage-
ment, and it is one of the most challenging and personally rewarding
jobs in our company.

Right now we're looking for a few highly qualified college seniors to
join us at the beginning level in brand management. “Innovative”,
“proven record of leadership and being able to get things done”,
“superior academic achievement”, and “good oral and written com-
munications skills” are some of the words we use to describe the
people we want.

We want a “take charge” person who can assume immediate respon-
sibility, learn quickly, contribute good ideas, and cope with (and even
enjoy) constantly changing situations. To such a person we offer a
very bright future. We promote only from within, and only on merit,
and you'll move ahead in marketing management as fast as you show
by your work that you're ready for more responsibility.

If this interests you, and you think you qualify, read the folder on P&G
Brand Management that's in your Placement Office. Then, if you're
still interested, fill out the Personal Data Sheet that's also in your
Placement Office and send it to:

Ms. Sandy Moersdorf

The Procter & Gamble Co.

P. O. Box 599— Dept.M
Cincinnati, Ohio 45201

Include both your school and home address and phone numbers. If the
Placement Office is out of Data Sheets, just send us a letter and your

resume.
