Big gapes characterize
Fancy Dress weekend

By PHILLIP HATCHETT

If the destruction of personal
property is in anyway indicative
of some really good gapes and
zood times then Fancy Dress "75
was probably the most successful
in history. The high number of
gapes seemed due to increases in
(1) police protection, i.e. radar,
(2) supplies of liquor; beer, grain
and house intoxicators and (3)
the additional day to the week-
end—a Thursday thru Sunday
affair.

After the initial reports were
received in the Co-op during
classes on Monday, the Phi de-
cided to conduct a preliminary
investigation. Basically the sur-
vey consisted of a call to each
fraternity house and get a report
from the nearest person to the
phone. This included house dam-
age and outstanding individual
loss.

The totals were rather impres-
sive.

80 plus windows broken

25 plus speeding tickets

$400 of articles stolen

8 pieces of furniture destroyed

7 cases of beer bottles broken

6 automobiles wrecked

5 plus bald tire tickets

4 plus violations for people on
to pof cars

2 plus wreckless driving charges

chimney removed

toilet ripped out

piano burned

piano top burned

fraternity door jumped

through

1 pair of glasses missing

1 band missing

1 pavilion entrance missing

The fraternities appeared to
specialize in gapes. Such was the
situation in the Beta Theta Pi
house, where after the first win-
dow was broken 41 followed. Con-
centrating on glass, the Beta's
crashed all seven cases of avail-
able beer bottles.

Phi Kappa Sigma likewise cen-
tered on one trait, swiftness. ‘We
got some speeding tickets—about
ten,” the informer said. He con-
tinued to explain that two of
the tickets belonged to the same
gentleman. Apparently, this
coachman received his first while
going to the pavilion and the
second one on his return trip.

ing evening on the American
legal system. Both addresses will
take place at 8 p.m. in Lee Cha-
pel, and both will be followed by
question-and-answer sessions.

The debate between T. Justine
Moore, president of Vepco since
1970, and David Brower, former
executive director of the Sierra
Club and now president of
Friends of the Earth, will take
place at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.
Again, a question-and-answer
session will follow.

Members of the public are in-
vited to attend both the talks and
the debate at no charge as guests
of the Washington and Lee stu-
dent body and the Interfrater-
nity Council, joint sponsors of
“Contact.”

Both speakers will tailor their
topic to the overall “Contact”
theme this year—"Critical Deci-
sions Facing America.” The
theme is derived from the name
of the organization established
by Nelson Rockefeller after he
left the governorship of New
York, before he was named vice
president.

Halberstam won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1964 for general report-
ing as a staff member of the New
York Times. He had previously
worked for newspapers in Missis-
sippi and Tennessee after his
graduation from Harvard.

His book “The Best and the
Brightest” is a well-researched
indictment of the Kennedy and
Johnson administration policies
that led to deep American in-
volvement in Indochina. The Sat-
urday Review called it “the most
important book on public policy”
when it was published in 1972.

Rehnquist was named to the
Supreme Court in 1971 (he was
nominated simultaneously with
Lewis F. Powell Jr., a Washing-
ton and Lee graduate and trus-
tee since 1961.

At 50, Rehnquist is the young-
est member of the Supreme
Court. He is generally considered
one of its most scholarly and ar-
ticulate justices—and one of the

Legal and medical ethics taught

by STEVE YEVICH
Phi Feature Editor

Washington and Lee's experi-
mental ethics program currently
includes courses in medical ethics
and legal ethics as well as the
course in journalism which was
discussed several weeks ago in
the Ring-tum Phi.

The intent of these interde-
partmental courses, administer-
ed under the program called

Society and the Professions,” is
to subject pressing questions of
human values pertaining to these
professions to close academic
scrutiny, thereby sharpening the
student's perception of his own
field and of ethical choices with
which he will be confronted dur-
ing his career,

These two courses are similarly

tructured, with frequent class
seminars, several lectures pet

semester delivered by men ac-
complished in each field, and a
four-day symposium held on
campus for a select group of
practicing professionals.

The course on medical ethics,
to be taught in the spring term
by Dr. Hodges, co-ordinator of
the program, will focus on the
changes being wrought in the
profession by rapidly developing

technology and shifting social
mores. How should it be decided
who may live on this already

overcrowded planet’? When does
life begin? Is abortion ethically
acceptable. or is the right to life
a valid precept? How should
death be defined? With many
amazing types of life-supporting
machines in existence in limited
numbers, who decides who will
receive their use? How does one
reconcile the urgent need for
cientific experimentation with

inherent in using
humans for such experiments?
Should genetic engineering be
allowed? What should be done to
prevent the maldistribution of
scarce medical resources in soc-
lety?

These are
dilemmas

the dangers

some of the moral
facing physicians
everywhere; these are problems
with no pat answers. For ex-
ample, take a man suffering with
a terminal kidney disease: should
ust be given some morphine
to relieve the pain as he dies?
Should he be allowed the use of
a hemodialysis unit? Should he
be given a kidney transplant? If
o, why should he be given the
chance for a new life rather than
enother patient? To what extent
should he be allowed to deter
mine the nature of his treat-
ment?

Moore, considered one of the
leading spokesmen for the utility
industry has been associated with
Virginia Electric and Power since
1956, five years after his gradua-
tion from the University of Vir-
ginia Law School. He became
senior vice president and prin-
cipal financial officer in 1967,
and president three years later.

He is chairman of the Virginia

i7 years, during which its mem-
bership increased more than 1,-
000 per cent. Former Interior
Department Secretary Stewart
Udall once described him as “the
most effective person on the
cutting edge of conservation” in
the nation.

Vhen Brower and some mem-
bers of the Sierra Club clashed
over proposals to construct nu-
clear reactors on the California
Coast, a project he opposed, he
resigned from the organization
and founded Friends of the
Earth, which lobbies for increas-
ed environmental protection in
America and abroad.

Fancy Dress festivities
prove profitable to SAB

by JAM ES MASON

The Student Center has be-
come a bleak modern building
with white plaster walls and busy
people once again. The Starlight
Club is no more. All the blue
paper, tiny lights, long dresses,
and formal wear have disappear-
ed from the halls. That night of
elegance and spectacle known as
Fancy Dress "75 is now a thing of
the past.

Slumping Cagers
invited to play
NCAA _ tourney

The Phi News Staff

Through a strange set of cir-
cumstances, Washington and
Lee's basketball Generals have
received and accepted a bid to
the NCAA-Division III basket-
ball championships.

W&L will be the host of the
South Atlantic Regional, which
will be played March 7-8 in
Doremus Gym.

The Generals will host Glass-
boro State (N.J.) in the second
game of a doubleheader on Fri-
day the seventh. North Carolina
Methodist will take on William
Paterson (N.J.) College in the
first game.

The winners of the Friday
games will meet Saturday night
at 9:00 in the championship
game. The losers square off in a
consolation game at 7 p.m

Wé&L was informed of getting
a bid late Tuesday afternoon by
the NCAA selection Committee.

The Generals, who knew last
week that a win over either Ran-
dolph-Macon or Madison was a
necessity for a chance at a bid,
felt that their hopes for post-
season action were ended when
they lost both of these games
‘see page 3)

However Lynchburg College
who earlier had appeared to have
the inside track on the bid, was
removed from consideration when
it was learned that one of the
players transfer student
who, though eligible to play
made a sizable contribution to
the Hornets’ season, thus remov-
them from any consideration
lor the tournament

Should the Generals win the
regional tourney, they would also
host the quarterfinal game, most
likely to be played on March 11

Reading, Pa

Although the visible signs of
Fancy Dress have gone, the me-
mory of the affair still lingers on,
especially with the Student Ac-
tivities Board Chairmen David
Mathews and John Killpack. If
the evening proved profitable for
those out for a good time, it
proved even more practical to the
SAB in terms of dollars and
cents.

The leaders of the SAB esti-
mate that they may have taken
in as much as $9000. They had
earlier speculated that their sale
of tickets would bring them only
$6000. The weekend cost the SAB
close to $13,000 when they had
estimated its cost to be about
$12,000 prior to the event.

The Chairmen of the Student
Activities Board have thus come
up with around $2000-$3000 to
add to their budget. This amount
will be placed in the entertain-
ment fund of the SAB and will
be used to sponsor a concert in
the spring, if all goes well.

John Killpack stated that ap-
proximately 1200 tickets were
given out or sold, which means
that roughly 2,155 people were
there for the festivities. Nearly
90°° of the gentlemen appeared

in formal wear and almost every
lady in attendance followed suit.

The hoards drank their fill,
which is perfectly obvious to any-
one who was there. Thirty-eight
kegs of beer were consumed in
the course of the evening which
testifies to the state of the crowd.

All in all, the weekend proved
itself a success. What is in store
for next year? Well, it is a bit
early to tell, but if Fancy Dress
keeps accelerating at the pace es-
tablished in the last two years, it
might once again achieve na-
tional status as the social event
of the east coast.

A remembrance of things past

 

There have been some changes made, not the least of which was the remodeling of the front portal of
Zollman’s Pavilion. By Sunday the facility had become so crowded with students, dates, and miscel-
laneous debris from the last three days that the situation was intolerable. In what must be one of the
most memorable gapes in the history of Fancy Dress, one enterprising student decided to enlarge the

door by driving his car through the entry and into the building.

Thank you

Last weekend was a true revival of Fancy Dress. The Stu-
dent Activities Board expended a great deal of its time and
effort to make this year's Ball the best in recent history. In
this the members of the Student Activities Board surpassed
themselves.

Not only were we pleased by the performance of the SAB,
but we were relieved to see how generously the student body
supported the venture. In the end result it was as much the stu-
dent body which made Fancy Dress '75 a success as it was
anyone else. Its enthusiasm made Fancy Dress work and has
hopefully insured the resurrection of W&L’s traditional social
event of the year.

Especially heartening was the fact that the students decid-
ed to do it big, do it right and give it class, An example of this
can be seen in the fact that almost every single person at the
affair arrived in formal dress. Those who attended in anything
less were in the smallest of minorities. We think everyone was
happy to see that so many students had gone out of their way
to make Fancy Dress work,

\fter slapping everyone on the back, we feel that there ts
still room for a little constructive criticism, The grain party
organized by the freshman class was not handled as well as it
might have been. It is fortunate that it is nearly impossible to
jurn a grain party into a complete disaster for the organizers
did about as much wrong as they possibly could have.

The main problem that one can encounter at a grain Party
is a lack of grain punch, This was the case last Saturday when
it became impossible to get grain after a certain point,
Whether the people in charge ran out of supplies or simply de
cided to stop serving, the point is that there was not enough
grain available. Along the same line, that which was prov ided
was about as weak as pink lemonade. The freshmen should

have been more generous and better organized,

In spite of this weak link, the weekend was quite a success,

and for that we have only ourselves to thank,

Letter to the Editor...

Wahoos react to W&L pranks

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

I thought about writing this
letter earlier this year but did not
hesitate when I discovered that a
second incident of vandalism oc-
curred on a work of art which
peaks the staircase of the North
side of the Rotunda at the Uni-
versity of Virginia. As you know
the Rotunda is being restored.
Mr. Jefferson's original design
will once again come alive within
the shell of this historical and
architectural pheonmenon.

Last spring, a mural was paint-
ed by a team of University stu-
dents portraying Mr. Jefferson.
It was known as the “Construc-

tive Graffiti Project’ and its pur-
pose was to better the condition
of the boards surrounding the
Rotunda and hinder vandals.

The mural emphasized the in-
terminable importance of Mr.
Jefferson here at the University
and symbolically recognizes those
honoraries and societies which
in their own efforts further the
ideals of Mr. Jefferson.

Our tribute to Mr. Jefferson
has been invaded twice by Wash-
ington & Lee students who
thought it important to remind
us of the W&L-U.Va. lacrosse
game last year. If in fact the out-
come of the game is considered

by W&L students as a sacred
event in Washington and Lee
history and worth the disgusting
damage on our bicentennial sa-
lute, then the joke is on Wash-
ington & Lee University. We feel
that our efforts were indeed re-
spected by the University Com-
munity. It’s too bad W&L
couldn't join us in our tribute to
a great Virginian.

Not only was the mural dam-
aged but the marble steps of the
Rotunda are now ruined. The
Wé&L artists chose not to abide
by the basic academics of tidi-
ness and good taste. This inflic-
tion caused by spilled buckets of

Chinese paper cuttings to be placed
on display in duPont Hall next week

Twenty colorful “paper cutt-
ing” art pieces by a 76-year-old
Chinese grandmother, Teng Yun-
Chang, will be on display with
cuttings by many other Chinese
artists March 1 through 8 in du-
Pont Gallery.

The exhibition, currently on a
tour through the United States,
represents a small part of the
famous collection of Chinese folk

ing, also on an American tour
sponsored by the National Mu-
seum of History.

Paper cutting is an ancient
Chinese art. Initially the cuttings
were used as patterns for silk
embroidery, tapestries or other
stitching work, but they have be-
come an independent art form as
well.

paint and uncontrollable paint
brushes is a criminal offense.
Paint can not be removed from
marble. The paint was spilled in
such large quantities, certain
marble slabs may have to be re-
placed. Whoever was involved in
this senseless project will cer-
tainly see their signature on this
historical monument for years.
Incidentally, the Rotunda is NOT
a STOP sign! The Rotunda
stands as the center of the Uni-
versity Mr. Jefferson designed
and founded ‘one of the three
things Mr. Jefferson wanted to
be remembered by). We think it
is a disgrace that certain people
think a 13-11 score is just as im-
portant.

Both Washington & Lee and the
University of Virginia are in-
stitutions of academic excellence
and fine historical tradition.
Both will be important centers
for the Bicentennial. It’s a shame
that the few from W&L involved
with the childish incidents des-
cribed, make it impossible for
both institutions to coincide in
respect and pride for the Jeffer-
son ideal.

Lacrosse preview:
a strong attack;
a ? at midfields

(Ed. note: This is the first of
two articles on the upcoming
W&L lacrosse season by Phi
Sports Editor Bill Flesher. This
week Flesher talks with Generals’
head coach Jack Emmer about
the team at the offensive end of
the field. Next week the discus-
sion centers on the defense and
the season ahead.)

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

Take away three All-Americans
and several other key players
from a lacrosse team that came
within a heartbeat of playing in
the national championship game
last season and one has to ask
how that team might respond to
some new ideas about how the
game is played.

But if the man you ask that
question to is Washington and

 

Washington and Lee “unof-
ficially” opens its 1975 lacrosse
season Saturday when they
host the Chesapeake Lacrosse
Club in an exhibition game at
2 p.m. on Wilson Field.

Several old friends will be
returning for the game, which
has no bearing on the Gen-
erals’ season record.

Among them are two of last
year’s All-Americans, goalie
Skeet Chadwick and midfield-
er Ted Bauer.

Also playing for Chesapeake
are John Hopkins stars Bill
Nolan, Mike Siegert, and Bob
Barbera, and former Mary-
land standout Dave Dempsey.

 

 

 

Lee lacrosse coach Jack Emmer,
the answers flow like a river.

“We don’t expect to replace
the people we lost,” said the
three-time Coach-of-the-Year in
an interview Monday. “We are
simply going to make the most
out of the people we do have and
try to be successful with them.”

The shadows of All-Americans
Skeet Chadwick, Ted Bauer, Skip
Lichtfuss, Jim Farrar, and Bryan
Chasney will hang over Wilson
Field for quite some time in the
minds of W&L lacrosse fans, but
not in the mind of the team’s
coaches and players.

“We'll be doing things much
differently than we did with
players like Bauer and Licht-
fuss,’ Emmer said. “But again,
we feel that we have the players
to change our look.”

In the past, Emmer said, the
Generals have relied to a great
extent on control at the midfield,
where Bauer and Lichtfuss were
almost unstoppable. Now things
may move up to the attack for
offensive control.

“With the three attackmen we

have, we find it hard to believe
that all of them can have a bad
day on the same day,’ Emmer
said .

Two of the team’s tri-captains,
All-American Dave Warfield and
Don Carroll, return to the front-
line while junior Rob Morgan,
who sat out last year after trans-
ferring from Air Force, where he
led the nation in scoring his
freshman year, will replace
Chasney as the third attackman.

Emmer called the W&L attack
“a very flexible unit, with the
ability to run both a rotating
style of play as well as the set
patterns with a man on the
crease.”

But the big question mark, as
Emmer himself admits, lies at
the midfields, where graduation
hit the Generals the hardest.

Four of the top nine middies
were seniors last year, while four
others were just freshmen. Only
Ken Miller, one of two seniors on
this year’s team, has a class
standing above sophomore at the
midfields.

“We are terribly young at the
midfields,”’” Emmer said. “But we
are relying on our experienced
players to help bring our fresh-
men along.”

The four sophomore middies
who saw extensive action last
year, Jay Monahan, Ralph Baug-
her, Mick Kohlenstein, and Jack
Dudley, will team with Miller to
anchor the midfields.

Several freshmen, including
Scott Baugher, Ralph's younger
brother, Mark Derbyshire, Jay
Sindler, Bob Flannery, Brian
Tray, and Charlie Stieff, are
fighting for the remaining mid-
field spots along with sophs Mark
Krieger, Bob Raber, and Doug
Fuge.

WA&L picked up the bulk of its
points in the freestyle events, as
state champion John Hudson
scored a triple in the 200-, 500-,
and 1000-yard freestyles, while
Tad Van Leer added a double in
the 50- and 100-yard freestyles.

to break his own record by one-
half of a second.

The meet was up for grabs un-
til Duke pulled off one-two fin-
ishes in the 200-yard breast-
stroke and three-meter diving.

The loss gave W&L a 9-3 dual
meet mark for the year. Several
swimmers, including Hudson,
Van Leer, and members of the
400- and 800-yard freestyle re-
lay teams will now get ready for
the NCAA-Division ITI champion-
ship meet March 20-22 in Mead-
ville, Pa.

Only Jim Crytzer (158) could

The win assured the Generals
of a winning dual meet season,
as it upped their season mark to

Generals drop pair
but still receive

NCAA tourney bid

The same Washington and Lee
basketball team that was once
12-2 and on its way to the NCAA
College Division tournament saw
any hopes for post-season ac-
tion ended by two state rivals
last week.

The Generals, who had been
informed early in the week by
the NCAA Tournament Selection
Committee that a win in either
of their last two games would
guarantee strong consideration at
selection time, stayed with the
fourth-ranked small college team
in the nation, Randolph-Macon,
for nine-tenths of the game be-
fore falling, 67-62 on Wednesday,
then saw the roof cave in as
Madison waltzed to the Virginia
College Athletic Association
(‘VCAA) Eastern Division title in
a 77-57 win.

The pair of losses left W&L
with a 15-10 season mark, and,
while it did give head coach
Verne Canfield his ninth straight
winning season, it meant that the
Generals had dropped eight of
their last eleven games while
struggling for wins in the other
three.

The final week in review:

The Generals caught Ran-
dolph-Macon at just the right
time, as the Yellow Jackets were
coming off an exhausting double
overtime loss to Old Dominion
just two nights earlier.

But it took just 25 seconds for
R-MC to pile up the points that
made the difference in the out-
come, as All-American candidate
Fletcher Johnson, on the bench
most of the second half with four
fouls, hit five straight points to
break a 56-all deadlock with 2:-
47 left.

After that the two teams trad-
ed trips to the free throw line,
and, while W&L hit six of eight
and twice pulled within two
points, the Yellow Jackets an-
swered with a like manner of

charity tosses to hold the Gen-
erals off.

W&L jumped out to an early
12-6 lead, but couldn’t hold it for
long as R-MC popped in eight
straight points to take a 14-12
lead with 13 minutes left in the
first half.

From there the teams traded
one- and two-point leads, with
the Yellow Jackets taking a 36-
34 lead at intermission.

W&L came back behind the
shooting of Greg Croghan to take
a 42-40 lead four minutes into
the second half. But again R-
MC rallied, as sophomore Joey
Allen keyed a 9-3 spurt ot put the
visitors on top 49-46.

Then Johnson picked up his
fourth foul with 13:21 left, and,
with the 26 points per game scor-
er on the bench, W&L forged
back to a 54-54 tie with 5:58 to
go.
The two teams then displayed
excellent defense, holding each
other scoreless for more than two
minutes until Croghan hit a
jumper with 3:45 to go to put
W&L on top, 56-54,

But then Johnson came back
in, hit a three-point play, fol-
lowed it up with a driving layup,
and watched as Allen made a
steal and a layup to put the Yel-
low Jackets on top 61-56 with
2:25 left.

Then the teams walked up and
down the court for foul shooting
practice, which did little to af-
fect the outcome of the game.

Allen led the Yellow Jackets
with 19 points and 11 rebounds,
while Johnson, who fouled out
with 1:41 to play, ended up with
15 points.

Croghan led the Generals with
19 points, while Norm Kristoff
added 10 points and 10 rebounds.

THE RING-TUM PHI

EC makes procedural
changes in White Book

By JOE FITZGERALD
Phi News Staff

The Executive Committee vot-
ed Monday to ask the Chairman
of the Student Bar Association
to begin all public honor trials
within five days of a defendant’s
appeal of his conviction by the
E.C.

The President of the SBA is
made chairman of all public
trials according to the White
Book and can allow up to fifteen
days before the trial, following
an appeal.

The E.C. also voted to allow the
defendant in a private honor
hearing to ask for a suspension
after six hours of testimony. The
hearing will resume at the dis-
cretion of the President.

Most of the meeting was con-
sumed by discussion of what Le-
land McCullough called “little-
bitty changes” in wording and
procedure in the White Book.
The E.C. will ask the faculty to
come up with some sort of stand-
ard specific pledge to cover all
work done at W&L. No rule was
passed on a proposal that wit-
nesses in an honor trial not be
allowed to talk to each other
before the proceeding.

Also, possible honor violations
will be investigated by three
members of the E.C. instead of
the president and two other
members as presently required.
The E.C. also voted to change the
19th word in the first sentence of
the third paragraph of section I
of the White Book to read “of”
instead of “by.” Following this

change a subcommittee consist-

The E.C. will hold a final vote
at their next meeting on all
amendments to the White Book
passed so far. The E.C. is requir-
ed by their constitution to take
two votes on any honor system
change. The E.C. will also vote
on when the changes will go into
effect,

of the stolen items. This consist-
ed mainly of the house compo-
site.

The most diversified attack on
belongings came from a group
on Washington St. Its week-
end saw one toilet fly out the
house, one dive through a door in
Wahoo fashion, and a car thro-
ugh the pavilion. Added to the
unusual was the usual; several
windows broken and a little fur-
niture damage.

On the inter-fraternity front,
Saturday night, Lambda Chi Al-
pha seemed to loose their party
to the Sigma Nus. No band came
to the Nu house, so they took
charge of the action at the
Lambda Chi headquarters. Fin-
ally, the Sigma Chi’s, that group
of hellions, kept in typical form.
Their weekend was high-lighted
by the finding and returning of
an SAE’s wallet and checkbook.

What all this says about a
W&L student's respect for the
value of money does not bear
repeating. The education we re-
ceive on the weekends is price-
less.

Famous jazz trumpeter Don Ellis

to perform with W&L Ensemble

Phi News Staff

The big band jazz sound will
be heard in Lexington once again
this week as the renowned jazz
trumpeter Don Ellis pays a visit
to W&L. Ellis will spend Friday
working with the Washington
and Lee Jazz Ensemble, and he
and the group will perform at 8
p.m. Friday night in Lee Chapel.
There is no admission charge for
this public concert.

Such numbers as “Green-
sleeves” and “Eli’s Comin’” will
be featured in the performance,
sponsored by the W&L Concert
Guild, the Student Activities
Board, and Mu Beta Psi, the
W&L music fraternity.

Ellis, a native of Los Angeles,
has studied under such compos-
ers as Gardner Read, Stephan
Wolpe and John Vincent. He has
played with the bands of Glenn
Miller, Maynard Ferguson, Lionel

Hampton, and Woody Herman.
His own group has appeared at
the Newport Jazz Festival, the
Monterey Jazz Festival, Lincoln
Center, and Basin Street West,
to name a few well-known spots.

Ellis wrote the score for the
movie “The French Connection,”
and for his efforts received the
1972 Grammy Award for best in-
strumental arrangement of the
year.

By artful application of com-
pound rythms, Ellis has succeed-
ed in breaking away from the
square-time groove of conven-
tional jazz. He has experimented
with the musical resources of the
Indian ragas, unusual scale for-
mations, and complicated time
signatures. He has even had a
special trumpet built for himself
capable of producing quarter-
tones, notes that are found in-
between the normal twelve notes
in an octave.

Ethics program

(Continued from page 1)

There are no obvious correct
answers. What Dr. Hodges at-
tempts to do is to encourage the
student to identify and define the
problem sharply in terms of a
basic value conflict, and illustr-
ate it succinctly. Then some pos-
sible ways of resolving the im-
passe are proposed; for example,
the existence of pertinent legis-
lation, or previous attempts at a
viable solution. If spontaneous
debate does not develop, Dr.
Hodges takes a definite stand on
the matter to provoke members
of the class into trying to destroy
his position. “One of the best
ways to elicit student response is
to outline your own conclusions;
a clearly stated position fre-
quently arouses them to attack,
refine, and restate your pro-
posal,”’ he says. “Of course, final
answers are utterly impossible,
for there can be no clear unmix-
ed ‘good’ thing one should do.”

The legal ethics course, con-
ducted jointly by Dr. Hodges, Dr.
Lowry and President Huntley, is
exploring a variety of imposing
problems facing the legal profes-
sion, some of which have not
been adequately resolved since
the inception of law itself. Stu-
dents are grappling with issues
such as possible revisions in the
American Bar Association's code
of ethical responsibility, the pro-
per place of the lawyer in an ad-
versary system of justice, and the
true nature of justice itself.

Also to be pondered are prob-
lems with the privilege against
self-incrimination, the proper
determination of what consti-
tutes admissible evidence, positi-
vism versus naturalism in the
realm of jurisprudence, conflicts
of interest among judge, lawyer
and prosecutor, and the possible
effects of the Equal Protection
Clause on the availability of legal
services to all sectors of society.

The program in applied ethics
is being funded with a $300,000
grant from the Lilly Foundation
of Indianapolis. Three years have
been designated as the trial per-
iod during which the program
will be constantly evaluated. If
those involved find the end re-
sults sufficiently impressive, the
program wil be continued, hope-
fully in its present form. Owing
to the considerable expense in-
volved in organizing both the lec-
tures and the symposia for each
course, the continued existence
of the program after the first
three years will depend on the
support the program receives
from other outside sources. It is
not expected at this time that
the Lilly Foundation will con-
tinue to fund the program inde-
finitely.

The ethics program as it now
stands is an excellent model to
study and evaluate for further
applications. Such a program
could easily be expanded into
other professional fields, includ-
ing business, scientific research,
and politics. These courses would
help develop a much-neglected
area of our curriculum, that of
applied ethics, morals and value
judgment. Too often the college
student leaves the campus with-
out a sufficient understanding of
the basic values of society and
how they will affect his daily
professional life—an
seminar program, while expen-
sive to maintain, would presum-
ably be of great benefit to the
student who participates. Hope-
fully this is the conclusion that
Dr. Hodges and his colleagues
will draw.
