Black experience explored

By JO FIPZGERALD

Speakers, a concert, and a
“soul food” banquet highlighted
the events of Black Awareness
Week at W&L this week. In
addition, Black Awareness Week
Ball will be held Saturday night
in the Evans Dining Hall. The
purpose of the events, according
to the director of the affair,
John X. Miller, was to “make
the white student more aware”
of the black presence and experi-
ence in society.

The speakers have included Dr.
Samuel Proctor, Dean of Gradu-

ate Education at Rutgers Uni-
versity, Rev. Wyatt T. Walker
of the Canaan Baptist Church
in New York City, and Edward
Robinson, head football coach at
Grambling College. The concert
was performed by the Virginia
Union University Concert Choir.

Dr. Proctor spoke Monday
night in Lee Chapel on the sub-
ject of the “Black Educational
Experience.’ He spoke of his
time at Yale in 1945 when he
was one of four blacks in the
graduate school there. He said
the racism he encountered there
“toughened me” and suggested

that today’s black students could
learn from his experience there.

Tuesday night featured the
Virginia Union University Con-
cert Choir performing in the
chapel. The presentation, en-
titled ‘Music: A Door to Inter-
national Understanding,” featur-
ed mainly gospel music and a
selection from Giuseppe Verdi’s
opera, “Rigoletto.” In keeping
with the theme, the singers wore
colorful costumes from various
parts of the world during the
first half of the program.

Mock Convention group
prepares for May of ’76

By STEVE YEVICH

With the organizational meet-
ing last Thursday night, the
W&L Mock Convention Commit-
tee visibly began moving toward
its goal of developing a working
imitation of the Democratic Na-
tional Convention by May, 1976.

Much of the hardest work,
however, has already been ac-
complished behind the scenes.
The budget has been drawn up,
all committee functions have
been delineated, committee
chairmen picked, and most of
the basic planning completed.

According to Ken Ruscio, co-

chairman of the Steering Com-
mittee, most of his group’ efforts
to date have been spent in pre-
liminary planning and develop-
ment of specific goals for each
committee. Most of September,
for example, was spent in or-
ganizing a working budget for
the $20,000 allocated for the con-
vention. (Of this, $6000 is from
a Texas foundation and $8000
will be raised by a special $5 ac-
tivities assessment on every stu-
dent's tuition next year.)

The Steering Committee has
been trying hard to secure a
speaker for the winter term, as

Debate team captures trophies,
Takes 6 awards in tournament

Still early in the debate season,
debaters representing Washing-
ton and Lee University have
brought to ten the number of
trophies won so far this year by
sweeping six awards at the re-
cent regional tournament of Del-
ta Sigma Rho/Tau Kappa Alpha,
the principal debate fraternity.

Four W&L debaters — Bill
Gonch, Rodney Petersen, Eddie
Fisher and Mare Levin—again
captured the William Wells Chaf-
fin memorial trophy, the regional
organization's most prestigious
award. The Chaffin trophy is
named for Washington and Lee’s
late debate coach, who was kill-
ed in an automobile accident in
1970 while returning from a de-
bate meet in New England.

Competing in the debate meet
were teams from colleges in
Maryland, Virginia, and Wash-
ington, D.C. In addition to the
Chaffin award, W&L debaters

won first-place and fifth-place
team trophies (Gonch and Peter-
sen, first; Fisher and Levin,
fifth). Individual trophies were
awarded to Levin, named third-
best overall speaker in the tour-
ney: Petersen, fifth-best, and
Gonch, second place in impromp-
tu speaking.

The 10 trophies earned so far
place the W&L team substanti-
ally ahead of its standing at this
point a year ago, when the team
was on its way to its best record
in recent years with a year end
total of 17 trophies.

Halford R. Ryan, W&L’s debate
coach and this year’s president of
the Virginia Forensic Association,
was elected assistant regional
governor of the Maryland-Vir-
einia-D.C. district of Delta Sig-
ma Rho/Tau Kappa Alpha at a
business meeting held to coin-
cide with the regional tourna-
ment.

well as one for spring term, but
so far efforts have been unsuc-
cessful. At various times Sena-
tors Jackson, Kennedy, Mon-
dale, Muskie and Ribicoff have
been contacted for possible speak-
ing engagements, but all have
declined. It is possible a speak-
er of note may yet be procured
for February, but no firm com-
mitments have been received.

Enough interest has already
been stirred within the state that
Virginia notified W&L over the
weekend that the 1976 Mock
Convention has been designated
an official Virginia Bicentennial
Event. This is quite a compli-
ment for a student-run affair
that has been correct ten out of
fifteen times, including a string
of correct choices running from
the 1940's up to 1972.

Of all the subordinate commit-
tees, the Credentials Committee
will by far be the most important
in the whole process. It will serve
as a check on the political re-
search of each state delegation,
and has the task of analyzing the
complex election rules which
vary in each state. Already the
Credentials Committee has writ-
ten to every state for detailed in-
formation concerning such items
a sprimary election laws and
dates, vote-counting procedures,
and methods of choosing dele-
gates for the national conven-
tion.

Next month the Credentials
Committee will spend the bulk of
its time evaluating the results of
the Democratic mini-convention
heid late last fall and its impact
on next year’s convention.

This Committee will be sub-
divided into four geographic re-
gions to provide better coordina-

The theme of the lecture was
“Contributions of the Black Man
to American Society.” The lec-
ture is dedicated to the first black
graduate of the W&L law school,
who was murdered in 1970 in
Washington, D.C. while work-
ing with the Justice Department.

Eddie Robinson, the winning-
est black coach in college foot-
ball, was scheduled to speak
Thursday night on “The Black
Man in Athletics.”

All of the events except the
concert were followed by a re-
ception in the Alumni House.

Monday’s speech was attended
by a small mostly black crowd.
The concert was seen by a larger
group, composed of both black
and white students, as well as
faculty and persons from town.
Wednesday the audience was
again fairly small, but contained
more white students than Mon-
day's crowd.

The week concludes Saturday
with the B.A.W. Ball. The Ball
will be a formal affair sponsored
by S.A.B.U. and the Student
Activities Board.

SABU president emphasizes

Black Awareness Week goal

By STEVE YEVICH

Black Awareness Week, which
has been going on for several
days, is the culmination of nearly
a year’s planning by the Student
Association for Black Unity.

Eugene Perry, president of
SABU, said that the purpose of
this week was “to project the
ideas and feelings of the black
man toward America and to give
examples of contributions blacks
have made and continue to make
to society.”

More specifically, Perry ex-
pressed the hope that the week's
activities would “make the stu-
dent body and faculty more
cognizant of all blacks and in
particular of Washington and
Lee's black students, and with a
sincere effort on the part of the
school, to bring out a community
of black and white based on
friendship and trust.”

Last March the members of
SABU compiled a list of possible

speakers, blacks prominent in
their fields, and gave it to
Lutrelle Rainey, then head of
Student Minority Affairs. Rainey,
who at one time or another had
met most of the prospective
speakers, contacted them, and
narrowed the list to about a
dozen men in various professions.
Choices were made from the
remaining speakers on the basis
of their breadth of experience,
achievement in their fields, and
a similarity between their experi-
ences and those of the black stu-
dent on campus.

According to Perry, most of
the lecturers, realizing the limit-
ed financial resources of SABU,
agreed to present their talks for
free, and in some cases they paid
for their own expenses.

John X. Miller was appointed
head of a committee to handle
the necessary travel and lodging
arrangements, as well as to
organize the Black Awareness

EC sets dates
for public talks

on honor system

By the Phi News Staff

On Monday night the student
Executive Committee set Jan.
22-23 as the dates for public
hearings on the future of the
honor system, which will be held
at 7:00 p.m. in Lee Chapel on
both nights. In preparation,
President Ben Bailey appointed
each E.C. member to canvass a
particular building on campus
in search of faculty help in pub-
licizing the upcoming hearing.

The members are to ask the
instructors to inform students in
classes about the E.C. honor
survey and give students who had
not heard about it a chance to
fill out the forms. The forms,
which have been distributed by
the E.C. since December, ask for
student opinion on the jurisdic-
tion, penalties, and procedure for
honor trials.

‘The members were also to ask
faculty members for their views
on the honor system, including
the public hearings.

In other business, the E.C.
heard from David Graham of the
Library Committee concerning
the disappearance of books from
libraries on campus. The E.C.
agreed to fund the placement of
more noticeable signs in the
libraries stating that the honor
ystem is in full force there,

Graham also reported that the

E.C. member Robert Pugh had
compiained that the signs im-

. .
Unwarranted and irresponsible

The arrangements for the Black Ball/Black Awareness
Week Ball which involved both the Student Activities Board
and the Student Association for Black Unity have shown
both these parties at their worst, although for different rea-
sons. When we speak of the SAB and SABU we refer ex-
clusively to the members of the SAB who have been in-
volved, i.e., John Killpack and David Mathews, and those four
or five Blacks who as members of SABU have been the lead-
ing force on the other side of the conflict.

The four or five members of SABU directly participating
in the drama have been guilty of failing to communicate fairly
and frankly with the Student Activities Board and_ their
manner has bordered on arrogance. The SAB leaders, on the
other hand, capitulated too readily to pressure from a special
interest group and in doing so failed to represent and serve
the majority of the student body to whom they are primarily
responsible.

Before offering our comments on the circumstances which
led up to Black Culture Week, a brief recounting of the
Byzantine court intrigue, hopefully as factual an account as
is possible, would be in order.

Last year the Student Activities Board, in this case the
entire board, responded positively to a request from the
leaders of SABU to help fund a concert during Black
Awareness Week. The SAB promised $2000 for a concert if
SABU could match its contribution, Earlier this academic
year it became apparent that SABU could not come up with
its share. Previously, members of SABU had failed repeatedly
to attend meetings of the SAB to communicate to that body
about preparations for the joint venture,

In December when it appeared that Black Awareness
Week might not be all that it had been promised to be, a group
of freshmen made its complaints to Washington Hall authori-
ties. These blacks felt that they had in some sense been cheat-
ed when they joined SABU with expectations that could
not now be met. The administration then became somewhat
involved in that it brought together the SAB and the SABU
to work out another program suitable to both parties.

The members of SABU insisted that SAB provide them
with funds for the Black Ball and that the negotiations be
held during final examinations in December. This, although
inconvenient for the men from the SAB, took place. The SAB
finally promised to make $400 available and wanted to co-
sponsor a gala called a Black Awareness Week Ball which
would be free and open to all students, provide beer and be
informal. SABU insisted that the Ball be formal and with no
beer served, agreeing to the other conditions, and the SAB
capitulated.

Last week the Ring-tum Phi printed an invitation to the
activities of Black Awareness Week from its coordinator,
john X. Miller. The invitation from SABU referred to the
Black Ball, adding that it was formal and by invitation only
the invitations being available to any student of W&L who
cared to pick one up in SABU’s office. No mention was made
of the SAB’s co-sponsorship.

In reaction to this invitation the SAB made and distribut-
ed posters advertising the Black Awareness Week Ball and
did not mention the required invitations to be picked up. As
a result four members of SABU visited the member of the
SAB responsible for the new posters and accused him ol
undermining their Ball. In response to the intimidating visit
the posters were withdrawn and new ones were made men-
tioning the invitation requirement. At this point the invita
tions are available in the Student Center at the information
office.

The members of SABU active in this affair earlier refused
to discuss their plans and problems with SAB and finally
worked through the administration. After an agreement had
been supposedly finalized SABU failed to honor its commiut-
ment to the SAB to advertise the Ball as a joint venture and
as the Black Awareness Week Ball which does sound a good
deal less clannish than “Black Ball.” The active members of
SABU failed to deal openly with the SAB and last week paid
an unwarranted group visit to a member of the SAB in order
that they might get their way.

The Student Activities Board apparently felt compelled
to help finance the Ball when negotiations were set up by
the administration but it should not have committed funds
from the Student Body tax to an event which is obviously
designed with the interest of a minority of the students in
mind. Although the affair is open to all, one can hardly deny
that it is tailor made to meet the interests of only a small
group within the community, The 5 \B should allot its funds
to functions which will serve the greatest number of students.

Theoretically the Ball is open to all, but most of those
people involved in the intrigue would admit that the attend
ance will not be truly representative of the people who paid

could invite all the students but everyone would fully realize

that the program was designed to meet the wants and needs
of a small group rather than to serve the greatest number ol

Phe result of all this is that the Student Activities Board
has not done its job in this intance and has established a
dangerous precedent, SABU, on the other hand, has confused

Number of females falls

as winter term begins

By UNEEDA STUFF

If you are feeling the slowdown
of the Winter Term, this does
not necessarily mean that you
are a manic-depressive. Besides
the gloomy weather, the drop
in the female population of the
neighboring girls’ schools could
have a great deal to do with
your doldrums.

Hollins is still a nice place to
visit in the winter despite the
fact that nearly 50 percent of
the girls enrolled there are not to
be found on campus these days.
The missing girls are not all
escaping to the University of
Virginia—instead they are off
campus, working on independent
study programs and special pro-
jects. This year about 511 Hollins’
ladies remain on campus while
almost 420 have disappeared to
distant locations.

If the drop in numbers at Hol-
lins College sounds depressing in
itself you should keep in mind
that those girls who remained
behind did so in hopes that W&L
men would be here to show them
a good time.

At Sweet Briar the decrease in
the number of females on camp-
us has also dropped but not
so dramatically as is the case
at Hollins. However, the damage
should not be underestimated.
Sweet Briar has 452 students en-
rolled in regular on-campus
courses. Most of the other mem-
bers of the student body number-
ing 680 are away from Amherst
doing independent studies and
internships.

Mary Baldwin in Staunton al-
so allows its students to leave
during the January term but the
effect here is not devastating. Of
almost 600 girls enrolled there
only 80 are spending their short
term off campus. Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College does not
have a special term in the winter
and therefore all girls enrolled
were to return last Monday.

Certainly the female popula-
tion has declined in comparison
to that of the preceeding term
but things are not in dire straits.
If you can make it through the
present month relief will return
and just in time for Fancy Dress.

Nuckols prefers an all-male W&L

Editor’s Note: The following is
the second half of an interview
with the new Rector of the Board
of Trustees, E. Marshall Nuckols.
The interview questions were
telephoned to Mr. Nuckols who
returned his answers by mail to
the editor.

Q. We understand that you have
set up a committee to study co-
education as a possibility for
Washington and Lee. Please ex-
plain what has been done on this
and what remains to be done in
this connection.

A. At its meeting in May, the
Trustees authorized the Rector
to appoint a committee to study
the matter of co-education. The
Board specified, however, that
the Committee's responsibility
was to be one of fact finding
only and that the study was not
to be interpreted as pro or con
on the feeling of the Board of
Trustees in connection with co-
education. The appointment of
this Committee had been recom-
mended by the Board's Executive
Committee in order to determine
what affect, if any, the question
of co-education may have on the
ability of Washington and Lee
to retain its position as a unique,
independent, private university

This subject is one with which
the Board has concerned itself
periodically over a considerable
number of years. An extensive
study was prepared several years
ago by the University staff work-
ing in cooperation with a num-
ber of faculty members and stu-
dents. This study has been con-
sidered at length by the Trustees.
The new Committee will among
other things attempt to update
the facts developed in the earlier
study.

This Committee has now been
appointed under the Chairman-
ship of Trustee Frank C. Brooks.
It has not yet had an opportunity
to begin its study and probably
will not complete its review of
the essential facts before the May
1975, meeting of the Trustees at
the earliest.

Q. What do you believe are the
sentiments of the Board on co-
education at this point? What
are your own views on the de-
sirability of introducing co-edu-
cation here?

A. If the members of the Board
could have their “druthers” most,
if not all, probably would vote to
keep Washington and Lee an all

level. It is recognized though

DEAR TRAVELLER—1I can't find anything in that Greek labryrinth
they call McCormick Library. Can you clue me in as to some of
the latest in books and other materials now offered in the library,
and where can I find this stuff?

DEAR M

(Signed) M. Leech

-Yes, trying to find a book in the W&L library is a bit

like looking for a lacrosse jock in the classroom. However, fret
not. McCormick has many treasures well worth the three hours
it may take to locate them (provided members of the W&L student
body have not borrowed the books without checking them out,
as another variation upon that theme known as the Honor Sys-

them).

Here are just a few of those treasures:

The Sensuous Professor by “s". Yes, the one you've all been
waiting for: the sequel to The Sensuous Man, Woman, and Wombat
has finally arrived in McCormick Library. The startling expose
of a Washington and Lee professor and his intimate relationships

The Lord Giveth, and the Lord Burneth Out by Irving
Schmaltzrocker, The heartwarming and body-building story of
an unnamed Washington and Lee physical education professor
and his struggle with creeping socialism, the bubonic plague, and

Dormitory Counselors

Applications are invited for the personality characteristic believ-

positions of Freshman and
Upperclass Dormitory Counselors
for the 1975-76 academic year.
These positions are considered to
be among the most responsible
entrusted to Washington and Lee
students.

On the basis of past experi-
ence, certain guidelines for the
selection of Dormitory Counsel-
ors have been established. Ap-
plicants must be at least current
sophomores, and should not have
routine commitments after 8:00
p.m, that would normally take
them from the dormitory for any
appreciable time. While coun-
selorships are not awarded on
an academic basis, a student who
has failed to maintain a 2.0 aver-
age would probably not be select-
ed. Any counselor who is placed
on Academic Probation after be-
ing selected will be asked to re-
Sieh.

In order to insure their great-
est possible availability to coun-
selees, counselors are provided
a single room in the dormitory
and with the dinner meal, which
they are expected to eat in Evans
Dining Hall. Each counselor will
also be expected to live in his
dormitory room seven nights a
week and CANNOT HAVE OR
SHARE THE RENTAL ON AN
OFF-CAMPUS APARTMENT.

The primary basis for selection
of counselors to freshmen will
be their general fitness to aid in
making the dormitories a suit-
able environment for a student's
freshman year. Each applicant is
encouraged to obtain from the
Secretary to the Dean of Stu-
dents a copy of a statement more
particularly describing the goals
of our counseling system, the

ed desirable of a counselor and
the skills we hope a counselor
will posses or be able to develop.
STUDENTS WHO ARE PRES-
ENTLY DORMITORY COUN-
SELORS and who wish to re-
apply for next year should sub-
mit LETTERS to this effect to
the Office of the Dean of Stu-
dents by 4:00 p.m. on MONDAY,
JANUARY 27. In addition, re-
turning counselors should indi-
cate in their letter if they wish
to apply for Head Counselor or
Assistant Head Counselor.

N E W APPLICANTS FOR
COUNSELOR POSITIONS in
the freshman and upperclass
dormitories should submit letters
to this effect to the Office of the
Dean of Students by 4:00 p.m.
on MONDAY, JANUARY 27.
Such leters should indicate any
previous counseling experience
and the reason(s) for wanting
the position. Further details con-
cerning duties and responsibili-
ties can be obtained from Har-
rison Turnbull, Head Dormitory
Counselor, and Will Brotherton,
Kenny Mashburn, Lanny Rainey
and Tom Ramey, Assistant Head
Dormitory Counselors, each of
whom is a member of the Selec-
tion Committee. All applicants
for counselor positions will be
interviewed by a committee com-
posed of the Head Dormitory
Counselor and the Assistant
Head Dormitory Counselors.
There is a possibility that an
additional interview will be con-
ducted by selected members of
the Office of the Dean of Stu-
dents and other administrators.
Applicants will be notified by
mail of the time for interviews
after January 27.

Defense keeps Generals rolling
stuns Navy, 54-47, in 3-1

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

Washington and Lee’s basket-
ball Generals saw their seven-
game winning streak snapped
Saturday, but not before they
had again flexed their defensive
muscles to record one of their
biggest wins in recent years.

W&L stopped All-American
candidate Mickey Hampton cold
en route to a 54-47 win over the
Midshipmen Wednesday before
the largest home crowd of the
1974-75 season.

The previous night the Gen-
erals got clutch foul shooting
from sophomore Kim Sims in
the final two minutes to hold
off VCAA foe Bridgewater, 60-
57.

The victory streak came to an
end Saturday in Baltimore as the
Generals fell behind early and
could not come all the way back

the season. The Generals weren't as lucky, drop-

The on-court proposal by one
W&L student to a Bridgewater
cheerleader was the highlight of
Tuesday's game, far outshining
the often sloppy play of the Gen-
erals and Eagles.

Neither team took solid con-
trol of the game in the first half
until W&L ran off six straight
points late in the half to take a
30-26 lead.

With Norm Kristoff and John
Podgajny leading the way, the
Generals increased their margin
to as many as 10 points midway
through the second half, 48-38.

But as Kristoff rested, Bridge-

Duke heavyweight Joel Pulleo
pinned W&L's Steve Schweizerhof
in the first period of the meet’s
final match to give the Blue
Devils a 24-18 win Saturday in
Doremus Gym.

The loss was the first of the sea-
son for the Generals, who earlier
in the week had recorded a 22-
18 win over state rival George
Mason.

Schweizerhof's match against
George Mason also proved to
make the difference in the meet,
as his decision assured a W&L
win.

Also scoring wins against the
Patriots were Howdy Knipp

(118), co-captain Don Overdorff

Doug Ford (177).

The Generals came within one
match of beating Duke, as wins
by Ford and Bill Cole (190) had
rallied W&L to an 18-18 tie.

But Pulleo, a strong contender
for the NCAA heavyweight title
the past two years, put Schweiz-
erhof on his back just 1:42 into
the match to give Duke the win.

Knipp, Overdorff, Crytzer,
Ford, and Cole were winners for
W&L. Knipp, Crytzer, and Ford
kept their perfect 5-0-0 records
in tact.

Before the Generals game with
Navy, John Podgajny tried to
list all the possible excuses the
Middies could resort to in case
of a loss.

“They could blame it on a long
layoff during the holidays, or
could say the game is meaning-
less, or could say they were look-
ing ahead to their big game with
Air Force on Saturday.”

When it was over Navy could
offer no excuses—they had been
outplayed, well-defensed, and

A tale

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

It was 12:40 in the afternoon,
January 11, 1975 I found myself
in the world of bigtime college
basketball.

Seven hours later, only the
game remained the same, as two
teams squared off in a matchbox-
sized gym for little more than
the fun of it. It was quite a
transition to make—from a game
for fame and many dollars to one
for a good time.

In Cole Field House that after-
noon I was an anonymous as
a hot dog concessionaire—in a
crowd of more than 13,000 fa-
natics, only the 6’9” or above
beanstalks stand out.

But that evening I couldn't
help but feel that even though
the team I was covering was on
the road, I knew the few in
attendance as if they were long-
time friends.

The Maryland-Wake Forest
game, played in the “bigtime”
world, wasn’t missing any of the
ingredients that make such bas-
ketball bigtime.

There was the national coach-
of-the-year, Norm Sloan of North
Carolina State, on hand to size
up his Wolfpack’s next opponent
while trying to figure out just
how Wake did beat State.

There was a full television
crew on hand to bring East
Coast viewers another ACC game
of the week.

simply beaten by W&L.

Once the Generals got the lead
midway through the first half
they never gave it up, and the
only serious threat the Middies
made late in the contest was
stopped by more clutch free
throw shooting by W&L.

Podgajny, whose deadeye shoot-
ing in the first half was the
spark W&L needed to move in
front, went four-for-four from
the charity line in the final two
minutes, while Greg Croghan
added a pair of free throws which
helped the Generals put the
game away.

“The defense was the key,
there’s no doubt about it,” said
a happy W&L coach Verne Can-
field after the game. “It’s been

our strong area all year long, and
if ever we needed it, tonight was
the night.”

The Generals’ team defense
was superb, as the tight man-to-
man coverage forced the Middies
to rely on outside shooting
throughout the game.

But the key to the W&L win
might have been the defensive
job done on Hampton, Navy’s
floor leader and leading scorer.

The 6’2” guard, who entered
the game with a 16.0 scoring
average, had only a missed free
throw in the scorebook to show
for his efforts.

Canfield rotated Sims, Pod-
gajny, Bowman Williams, and
freshman Bob Forlenza through-
out the game to guard Hampton,
assuring a fresh man to guard
the Middies’ most dangerous
player.

“Hampton did a lot to stop

of two worlds

There were the many news-
paper, radio, and television re-
porters, including a_ favorite
target for sports and television
editors this past fall, ABC’s Don
Tollefson, who roamed the side-
lines at many college football
game to uncover such important
stories as the history of Bermuda
grass and the reasons behind
Miss High School Homecoming’s
marriage to the second string
tight end for Georgia Tech.

There were freshmen like
Maryland's Brad Davis and Wake
Forest's Rod Griffin, whose tal-
ents were evidence enough to
show why NCAA recruiting viola-
tions may occur.

There were fan incantations of
“You *!?*, ref,” which, after a
call went the Terps’ way, chang-
ed only to “You still *!?*, ref.”

It was bigtime college basket-
ball all right, complete with tele-

vision timeouts, cheerleader
routines set to pep band music,
personalized towels for the Wake
Forest players, a Lefty Driesell
temper tantrum, and a final
“Amen” sendoff for the Deacons
when the host ‘Terrapins had the
game in the bag.

There weren't any great mobs
flocking to the University of
Baltimore Academic Center to
see the Super Bees host Wash-
ington and Lee, as had been the
case in College Park earlier in
the day.

Note that—Academic Center.
Not Field House or Arena or
Auditorium or even Gymnasium.
Academic Center.

It was back to the world of
basketball as I had come to know
it over the past two and one-half
years. Basketball for the fun of
it.

overs.

Podgajny led W&L_ scorers

gomery led all scorers with 15.

Hank Kuzma added 12 and 11

Among Verne Canfield’s pre-
game words to his players be-
fore the Baltimore game was a
warning that the Bees, in the
midst of a disappointing season,
might blow the locker room door

down en route to their meeting
with the Generals.

Though the door remained on
its hinges, the hosts did exactly
what Canfield feared—came out
fired up and stuck it to W&L
early.

Baltimore jumped out to a 12-
2 lead as the Generals couldn't
find the basket in the first five
minutes. The Bees increased their
lead with several fast breaks to
as Many as 22 points in the first
half before the Generals could
cut the margin to 36-18 at half-
time.

The Bees continued their
domination in the opening
minutes of the second half, and
for a while it looked like a rout
was in the offing, as Baltimore
opened up a 25-point lead with
15:14 remaining.

Is the game still the same?

(Continued from page 3)

The basketball floor was found
two flights up. No one could be-
lieve it. Third floor. Oh well, it’s
only a game.

The only coaches in attendance
were those whose teams were in
action. No television crew, just
a two-man radio team who piped
the game back to Lexington, Vir-
ginia, to be aired over a 10-watt
FM station.

Only one newspaper reporter
(myself) was there. There were
no obnoxious fan incantations,
no TV timeouts, and things of
that like.

And no Don Tollefson to tell
viewers about the uniqueness of
the game being played on the
third floor of the building.

It was a game played in the
highest of competitive spirits,
with little more on the line than
the ability to say “We won the
game,” when it was over.

There wasn’t a lot of alumni
pressure to win, nor were there

in case of a poor performance.

Not to say this was the case
in College Park, or at any other

is plain and simple absent from
the game teams like W&L and

They play for pride, for the
love of the game, and, most of

Hopefully that’s what lies

But the Generals refused to
fold, proceeding to stage a furi-

minutes. With Podgajny and
Kristoff picking up the offense
and a tenacious zone press forc-
ing BU into several turnovers,
W&L outscored the Bees 28-10

But Baltimore showed they
had a bit too much for W&L

the press with fullcourt passes
that resulted in easy layups to
put the game away.

After a lethargic first half,

other hand, I am convinced the
Board must keep an open mind
and review all of these questions
from time to time as circum-
stances change. We certainly
should wait until the facts are
all in before reaching any con-
clusions.

Q. We have been told that you
are one of the better Charleston
dancers on the East Coast. Would
you care to elaborate on your
accomplishments?

A. President Huntley apparently
has been spreading this rumor.
If I have any accomplishments in
this area it is simply because I
grew up at a time when the
Charleston was the popular
dance. That says a great deal
about my age. In any event,
whether accomplished or not, I
enjoy giving it an occasional try.

Preparations for ‘76 Convention

(Continued from page 1)
tion between the state delega-
tions and the central division of
the committee. The nationwide
polling services will be used to
a greater extent next year than
in past mock conventions.

Perhaps most importantly of
all, the Credentials Committee is
compiling a list of possible con-
tacts it can make with state and
national politicians. The crucial
New York and California pri-
maries will occur after the Mock
Convention, thus adding too
much uncertainty to the proce-
dure, unless direct information is
available. Furthermore, the 1976
Democratic convention has the
potential to be a brokered con-
vention; that is, one where the

major decisions will be made in
ante-room caucuses, Since there
is a strong possibility of this oc-
curring, participants in W&L’s
convention will desperately need
personal, direct contacts with the
real delegates in order to predict
the outcome with any accuracy.

The other committees have
also been engaged in initial plan-
ning. The Parade Subcommittee
has a basic budget of $1000 that
it has been working with — more
money will be raised later. Plans
for the ‘Journal’, the official
publication of the convention, in-
clude comprehensive articles on
the candidates, a history of past
mock conventions, as well as the
schedule of events for the Con-
vention Weekend.
