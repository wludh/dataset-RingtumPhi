Faculty to Consider
Accelerated ‘Terms
At Next Meeting

Shortened Semesters,
Summer School Among
Emergency Alternations

Keeping in step with a nation-
wide wartime program to acceler-
ate college sessions in order to
give students an opportunity to
finish four years work in three
years, the faculty will meet Mon-
day afternoon, February 24, 1942,
to take under consideration a
speed-up program for Washing-
ton and Lee.

Three committees of the facul-
ty are working on the new pro-
gram at present and, according
to President Gaines, all indica-
tions are that the program will
be adopted beginning with a
shortened second semester and a
summer school session. This may
involve curtailment of all holi-
days and a short exam shcedule
this semester, Dr. Gaines said.
Final plans will be decided at the
faculty meeting on Monday.

li the proposed plan is adopted,
there will be a voluntary summer
program for all students, which
will be merely “an extension of
the reguiar session.” Present
plans are to divide the summer
session into two halfs in order to
“accomodate the varying needs
of the students.” The first half
will be six weeks long with classes
meeting five days a week, and
the second half will last for five
weeks with classes scheduled six
days a week. Classes will be an

14 Students Fail
To Come Back
After Holiday

Fourteen W&L students have
been called to military service
and have left school since the
beginning of the ‘41 winter break.

Those entering the Navy are
Sam Ames, senior, ATO, from
Norfolk, Va.; Bud Bowie, junior,
ATO, from Washington, D. C.;
Fred Bromm, sophomore, Phi
Gam, from Evansville, Ind., en-
tering the Naval Ordnance Dept.;
John Sherman, Phi Gam, sopho-
more, from Bronxville, N.Y., en-
tering the Naval Reserve.

Also, Gregg Burger, senior, Phi
Delt, from Staten Island, N. Y.;
and Meridith P. Wiswell, fresh-
man lawyer, PiKA, from Hunt-
ington, W. Va., have been in-
ducted into the Naval Air Corps.

Tody Coleman and Bill Cos-
crove, lreshman, from Middleton,
Conn., and Luther Jordan, senior,
KA, from Mansfield, La., have
entered the Marine Corps.

Those entering the Army are
Jay Norton, senior, Kappa Sig,
from East Aurora, New York, and
Bob Gill, freshman, from Smith-
field, Va. Also, Elliot Butts,
senior, Phi Gam, from Jackson-
ville, Fla.; Norm Fiero, junior,
Lambda Chi, from Rahway, N. J.,
and Bert Nelson, senior, KA,
from Tampa City, Fia., have en-
tered the Army Air Corps.

hour and a half in length, Stu-
dents will be allowed to take two
courses (that is, three hours a
day). In this way, a maximum
of 12 semester hours of work
would be obtainable during the
11-weeks period.

All courses which are required
as prerequisites for higher cours-
es would be offered in the
summer school, as well as courses
required for the various majors.
Other courses would be offered
as the demand calls for them.
The possibility of opening the
summer school program to
women is “now being discussed”
by the faculty committees. As
ihe summer program is now pro-
posed, members of the present
junior ciass who attend the ses-
sion and received the full 12
hours credit, would be able to
graduate the following February,

es they took six courses

dwring tne first semester of next
year.

Tne dates ior the proposed
summer session have not yet been
decided. By eliminating Spring
Vacation and shortening the sec-
ond semester exam period, this
college year would probably end
about May 25.

NOTICE

College students
mediate induction into the Army
would cause “undue hardship”
because of interference with their
work may be given deferment
until the end of the semester
during which they are called.
This applies mainly to medical
and engineering students. For

Dean of the College in Washing-
ton 24.

Timely Advice

 

The ‘above, one of 1 many posters to be found on campus, carries a
message which each of us should bear in mind. Loose lips sink
ships and cause needless deaths on the battlefield.

University Dance Code

1. All Washington and Lee dances shall be free from intoxicants
and the effects thereof.

2. Any person attending a dance in violation of Regulation 1
shall be removed from the gymnasium immediately and suspended
from attending further dances until his case has been tried by the
Executive Committee of the Student Body.

3. The penalty for a first infraction of Regulation 1 shall be ex-
clusion from one half of the dances of a session, commencing with
the date of the offense: provided, that for drunkenness or other
disorderly conduct, or for a second offense, or for the possession of
intoxicants anywhere within the gymnasium during a dance, the
penalty shall be exclusion for not less than one calendar year. For
visitors and alumni, the penalties shall be not less than those pro-
vided for students under similar circumstances.

4. No visitor shall be admitted to any dances unless vouched for
in writing by a student or by some person officially connected with
the University. If a visitor shall be found gulity of violating Regula-
tion 1, above, a student vouching for him shall be excluded from
one or more sets of dances,

5. Smoking is prohibited at all times on the dance floor and in
the balcony.

6. General conduct shall conform to the commonly accepted
standards of good society.

7. The Dance Floor committee is vested with full authority and
accepts responsibility for the enforcement of these regulations.

A Few Suggestions

Please Watch Your Step

Next Friday night, February
28, 1942, the Lexington area will
have its first practice blackout.
And a blackout is something
which demands 100 per cent co-
operation and efficiency. A
lighted match, a careless driver,
an uncovered window can spell
disaster.

It's only a practice, but the
fact that it is not the real thing
doesn't mean that it shouldn't be
taken dead seriously.

Most students still remember
how amusing it seemed when a

EC Will Poll
Student Body on

Corsage Issue

Many Want Flowers Banned;
Questionnaires to be Circulated

Does the student body want
the passage of a rule banning
flowers for dates at University
dances?

That's the question to which
the Executive Committee will try
to answer by means of a poll
next week, Student Body Presi-
dent Al Snyder announced today.

The committee Tuesday night
decided to conduct a poll in an
effort to find whether or not
sentiment in favor of anti-flower
legislation is widespread enough
to warrant action by the Ex-
ecutive group. Attacks on the
giving of corsages have been
launched several times in the
past few years, but none have
proved weighty enough to result
in the abolition of floral gifts.

“Numerous members of the
student body have asked the
Executive Committee to consider
legislation banning flowers,”
Snyder said in announcing plans
for the poll. “We are not trying
to push anything through, but
feel that the problem should be
considered inasmuch as so many
students have asked for such a
consideration.”

“The committee feels that the
opinions of every member of the
student body should be heard be-
fore any definite action is taken,

and a poll appears to be the best
method of obtaining a complete
collection of those opinions,”
Snyder continued.

“We are announcing plans for
the poll now so that each mem-
ber of the student body will have
plenty of time to weigh the vari-
ous arguments. The commitee’s
desire is not to rush into any
action, but rather to find out
what the student body wants.
Whether or not we have legisla-
tion against flowers is a question
which the student body will be
called upon to answer.”

If sentiment as expressed in
the poll emphatically favors pro-
hibitive legislation, the Executive
Committee will draw up an act
barring flowers from all Uni-
versity dances. Such a measure,
Snyder said, would probably be-
come a part of the Dance Board
regulations and enforcement
would fall to the floor committee.

A three-man committee was
appointed by Snyder to draw up
questions for use in the poll.
Their questions will be submitted
to the Executive group next
Tuesday night for approval, and
printed questionnaires will be
circulated among fraternity
houses and eating places next
Thursday.

Zigging Jitterbuggers Land in Hospital

A couple of jitterbugs landed
in the hospital when they tried
to keep up with the “Washing-
ton and Lee Swing’ in Mobile,
Alabama.

Here's the story as reported
in a September ‘41 issue of a
Mobile newspaper:

“Who was it who said ‘Zig
when you should zig, and zag
when you should zag’? Anyway,
Evelyn Dill zigged when she

should have zagged, and she paid
for it.

“It was the jitterbug dance
craze combined with a juke point
version of the W&L Swing in
boogy-woogy time, enough to
cause any accident,

“Now when the girl zig pecks,
the boy zags pecks, and vice
versa. When the girl jig pecks
and the boy zig pecks at the same
time, there's liable to be trouble.
This time there was.”

Reacts to Pearl Harbor

The timely advice of Dr. Tucker and the well considered editorial

speaker before the University
Defense Forum said last Novem-

Lexington would be having its
blackouts and air raid warnings.
But that was before December

realized that the coastal areas
of the nation are highly vulner-
able to bombing attacks.

Of course, no Axis bombardier
is going to dump a half million

Troub Drama Satirizes Nazis

Thursday. night, February 27,
1942, at eight o'clock, Washing-
ton and Lee's dramatic group,
The Troubadours, will present
one of the most popular plays of
last season in Clare Booth’s
“Margin For Error.’

“The Third Reich allows no
margin for error,” is the line
from whence the title came, and
this philosophy of administration
backfires during the course of the
play to the chagrin of the staff

at a Nazi Consulate in New
York. and to the delight of the
audience,

The Consul, Karl Baumer, is
played by Ed Boyd in his usual
manner, which is to say a flaw-
less performance may be ex-
pected

His wife. Sophie, a frustrated
American eirl] who married Bau-
mer years before as a means of

escaping from Germany, is play-
ed by Esteen Cooke.

Sophie is in leve with a young
American newspaper man, Tom
Denny, played by Jim Clarke.
Clarke has a difficult part, but
handles it extremely well. When
the play was produced profes-
sionally,, crities referred to him
as somehow “two-dimensional,”
eoloriess, merely a voice express-
ing American contempt for the
Nazi person as well as the Nazi
philosophy.

The mayor of New York as-
signed a Jewish policeman, Moe
Finklestein, as Baumer's body-
euard. This leads to many amus-
ing situations, with Finklestein
expressing freely and eloquently
his sentiments and the senti-
ments of his race toward the
Nazi bully boys. Bill Lats, as
Moe Finkiestein, turns in a con-
vincing performance of the long-

est part in the entire play. His
part reaches its zenith when he,
a New York Jewish boy, is called
pon to unravel the murder of
Baumer, the Nazi consul.

Next to Boyd, perhaps, the most
polished performer seems to be

wk Lanich, a newcomer. Most
of the drama is added by his
characterization, and he does it
well, managing to remain on the
thin line between melodrama
and under-acting, Charles Thal-
helmer, as the inevitable doctor,
and Helen Anderson. as the Ger-
man maid add the final touches
of realism to a play which lacks
little.

At one point in the preduction
an actual speech of Adolph
Hitler is broadcast. Farrar wrote
to New York for recordings of
this speech, and they should
prove interesting.

industrial belt, were gleaming
brightly, he could get his bear-
ings and proceed to blast to bits
some munitions factory or naval
base or thickly populated area.

That is why Lexington has
scheduled a practice on Friday
night. And here are a few sug-
gestions to Washington and Lee
students to help make it effective.

Each fraternity should have
some representative see the local
officials in charge of the air raid
precautions and determine just
what measures should be taken
to blackout the fraternity houses.
It is impractical to set about
covering all the windows. but the
basement lounges of most the
houses could be made into ex-
cellent shelters with a little work.
Then it would be unnecessary
for all to sit around in the dark
for two or more hours.

All students with cars should
most certainly get off the streets
before the warning sounds about
eight o'clock, for even in a “play”
blackout one can pile into a
ditch or telephone pole with a
little or no difficulty.

With all restaurants and school
buildings closed there should be
no excuse for anyone to be on
the streets, which are to be
patrolled by VMI cadets and
civilian wardens,

During the next week every-

one should familiarize himself
with all the regulations to be in
effect during the blackout and
prepare to do his part to make
this effort as successful as pos-
sible

comment contained in the last issue of this paper merit thoughtful
consideration from every student. Here I offer an observation and an
assurance.

When this emergency developed, I telegraphed President Roose-
velt pledging full support of the University. I am confident that
every member of the academic community shares that sentiment, a
desire to affirm our deepened allegiance and a desire to be of maxi-
mum service.

With its wiser comprehension of ways by which that service may
be rendered, our Government has not indicated any change in the
attitude toward the college man. As before, those who are impelled
by profound desire to enter a combat unit may do so, and those who
want to complete their training may feel that they are discharging
a patriotic duty in giving themselves the best fitness, whether for the
later stages of the emergency or for the larger requisites of citizen-
ship after the days of warfare.

At all events, students should not be disturbed by the volume of
rumors, already denounced by President Roosevelt, which are flood-
ine our excited country and undermining the morale of our people.
For example, as chairman of the Committee on Public Affairs of the
Association of American Colleges, I have been giving much time to
the Government's expectations from the colleges, and I repeat that-—
rumor to the contrary—there has been no change in the attitude or
program relating to colleges.

Students will, I am sure, reason with themselves that the immedi-
ate duty is to bring all energies of mind to discharging their present
task. It is an opportunity of patriotism. not less than of personal de-
velopment, to have the privilege of college education.

No worthy causes and no worthy people—not your country, not
your family, not yourseif—could possibly be served by undue worry,
by needless meloncholy, least of all by just quitting and giving your-
self to idleness and purposeless dismay. No cause could be served by
such conduct except the enemies of this country who would surely
like to spread panic in the mind of the college youth.

The University promises to keep the students advised of any
change that affects their status of national obligation. The Uni-
versity promises to help its boys, personally and collectively, as far as
outsiders can help in the domain of individual decision, as these
boys seek to interpret that duty. The University promises, as Dr.
Tucker said, to adopt fair procedures in the case of every student who
is subject to the emergency demand that interrupts his own pro-
gram of life

We have always been proud of the maturity of self-control and the
clearheaded judgement that mark Washington and Lee men. In these
troubled days our boys will sustain these qualities in their own lives.
to the infinite advantage of both the country an dthemselves.

Fancy Dress, Feb.

A War-Time Affair

In official cireles it's known as “Fancy Dress 1942.” What
a phrase that has turned out to be!

The Junior Prom has come and gone, ‘Tomorrow night
brings on the Ball itseli—Monte Carlo in 1861, with all the
dazzling splendour of the luxurious court of Napoleon, III,
and the Empress Eugenie. Then a dansant and the next night,
the ODK Formal to put the finishing touches on the outstand-
ing social affair of Washington and Lee,

It’s the 36th annual Fancy Dress set, but few students are
interested in the past history of the Ball. What’s much more
important is the fact that here and now, at our feet, is “Fancy
Dress 1942,”

1942 is no common, ordinary year. It has been and will be
packed with excitement unlike anything we have ever experi-
enced before. New events, new names, and new places are
every day being brought to our minds with a force that is
sometimes almost strong enough to knock us over.

So it naturally follows that this is no common, ordinary
Fancy Dress. No matter how many dance sets we have at-
tended before, this Fancy Dress will be a new experience for
all of us. It is a war-time Ball on a war-time basis, and it
will inevitably bring with it all the excitement and interest of
the days in which we are living.

Corsages were absent from the Junior Prom. Decorations
have been kept at a minimum. But there were the band, and
the music, and the evening dresses, and the girls—and on top
of all that, the excitement and glamour of 1942.

Tomorrow's dance will provide a perfect example of the
atmosphere of the whole set. The costumes and colors of a
Monte Carlo in 1861, the quiet t and ordered tempo of those
dear, dead days, will be somewhat symbolic of the 35 Fancy
Dresses that are past. But to offset that calm and collected
atmosphere, there'll be a band heaving the rhythm of the time),
Harps and violins might be appropriate to Monte Carlo in
1861, but Woody Herman's drums and trumpets are far more
fitting for 1942.

So it becomes more and more obvious that this is a Fancy
Dress to be long remembered, The student leaders and their
aids deserve a lot of credit for bringing about a dance set such
as this under trying circumstances. It was not a small task,
and by no means an easy one,

exams, fortunately, are a thing of the past. Beginning next
week there lies ahead of most of us a new semester of class-
rooms and tests. We must accept the inevitable, but for the
moment—tonight and tomorrow—we can still enjoy what will
surely be the grandest Fancy Dress of our lives.

Editor, Ring-tum Phi

Dear Sir:

Friends and alumni of Wash-
ington and Lee have always been
proud of the seemly behaviour
and gentlemanly appearance of
members of the student body.
For generations, Washington and
Lee students have been careful
to maintain their well-earned
reputation in this respect, by a
scrupulous observance of the
niceties of conduct and appear-
ance, and by a careful consid-
erateness, not only of the rights,
but of the comfort and feelings,
of their fellow students, and
especially of the general public
with whom they come into con-
tact both on and off the campus.

When one hears over and over
again that the gentlemanly be-
haviour of Washington and Lee
students suffers distinctly by
comparison with that of mem-
bers of the student bodies of
nearby institutions, it is alarm-
ing. When one sees members of
the student body of one of those
strangers to them, while our own
boys pay so little attention as
scarcely to allow them room to
pass On & compus walk, it is
appalling! When one walks into
& meeting at Lee Chapel, and is
confronted by a row of from
twenty-five to fifty students sit-
ting in the balcony seats with
dirty shoes marring the paint on
the rail, with knees as high as
shoulders, and trousers pulled up
to expose wrinkled socks and not
too shapely but very hairy calves,
it is disgusting! And when, at the
same meeting, one sees a student

sitting in one of the front seats
downstairs, calmly smoking a
pipe, in a building not fireproof-
ed, utterly disregarding a group
of ladies sitting nearby—well,
something is wrong!

A stroller through the comfort-
able and beautifully furnished
reading room of the new McCom-
ick Library, which is open to the
public and necessarily frequent-
ed by the ladies on the staff of
the library, finds students in
various stages of undress, with
feet marring the surfaces of good
furniture and soiling the white
paint of raditors, hats on, and
cigarette stumps ground out on
the floor, even though ashtrays
are provided in abundance.

No one will believe that Wash-
ington and Lee students really
have as little respect for pro-
perty, whether public or private,
as they seem to exhibit.

If other evidences of what
must be only an apparent de-
cadence of good manners at
Washington and Lee were need-
ed, the writer could furnish them.
Such specification is, it is hoped,
quite unnecessary, and is surely
undersirable. If this letter does
anything to bring about a more
careful self-criticism in these
matters on the part of the indi-
vidual student, it will have ac-
complished all that could be
hoped for by one who writes in
& spirit of sympathy and well-
wishing, and of honest criticism.

Sincerely,
An Alumnus.

Because of the greatest musical

ships” and “At the Fancy Dress
Ball” will not be broadcast by
Benny’ Goodman or Charlie
Barnet during Fancy Dress 1941,
unless peace is restored between
ASCAP (‘American Society of
Composers, Authors and Pub-
lishers) and the powerful radio
chains.

ASCAP collects money for the
use of its music from theatres,
night clubs, restaurants and
radio stations, and distributes
it to its members who, without

Fancy

some such organization, would
find it almost impossible to col-
lect their royalties. Last year
two-thirds of ASCAP’s income
was derived from radio. This
year the society wanted to raise
radio’s license payments to $6,-
500,000 and place most of the
burden on the big broadcasting
chains.

In rebuttal, the broadcasting
industry, backed by the power-
ful chains, set up a rival ASCAP
in Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI)

to supply music for radio’s needs
independent of ASCAP.

In a sparkling atmosphere of
international revelry and splen-
dor amid the columned, crystal
beauty of Monte Carlo’s famed

theme of the Ball is a reenact-
ment of the grand opening of
the famous Casino at Monte

ulous fortunes were won and lost
will be centered about a reception
tendered visiting royalty by Na-
poleon, III, of France and the
Empress Eugenie. The gala open-
ing ball will follow the reception.

The Fancy Dress Figure, fea-
turing the set’s nine officers and
50-odd students and their dates,
will portray the reception, while
costumed hundreds will con-
tribute to the merriment of the
Ball.

Included among the leading
figures at the festivities will be
the Prince of Wales and Lily
Langtree, famed English actress;
Alexander, II, of Russia, and
Tzarina Augusta Victoria; Max-
imillian and Carlotta, of Mexico;

Don Francisco Assissi, King of
Spain, and his queen; Franz
Joseph, Emperor of the Austro-
Hungarian Empire, and Empress
Elizabeth; Victor Emmanuel, I,
of Italy, and Queen Maria Adel-
aide; the Bey of Algiers and his
lady; and the Prince and Prin-
cess of Monaco, site of the Casino.

The Figure will include an
elaborate presentation in which
visiting royalty, dipomats, gen-
erals, and, generally, la creme
do la creme of international so-
ciety will be allowed to offer
their salutations to the Emperor
Napoleon, Ill, and his Empress
Eugenie. The guests will be pre-
sented in strict accordance to
rules of international and royal
etiquette.

First will come the Tzar of
Russia, Alexander, IJ, and Au-
gusta Victoria. Following the
imperial couple will be the Arch-

Strains of ‘Old Kentucky Home’
Open Pageant Based on Derby

Kay Kyser and Bob Chester!

They're the bands for Pancy
Dress 1940. And there's more!

To the strains of “My Old
Kentucky Home,” Fancy Dress
leaders will pantomine a recep-
tion at Federal Hill, mansion of
Colonel John Rowan, given in
honor of Colonel H. P. McGrath,
owner of the horse that has just
won the Kentucky Derby.

After the leaders have walked

in, the proceedings will start with
a toast to Governor Leslie of
Kentucky proposed by Colonel
Rowan. All the prominent Ken-
tucky gentlemen will be repre-
sented by members of the senior
class,

Doors will close at ten o'clock
sharp tonight for the Fancy
Dress Figure, the set president
said today. Anyone arriving
after that time will have to
wait until the Figure is over
before being allowed in

Following the Governor's re-

sponse to the toast, the partici-
pants will drink the health of
Aristides, the winner of the
Derby, and McGrath, and then
present a loving cup ‘to Colonel
McGrath.

Next, Ginny Simms will sing
a Stephen Foster melody, and a
wreath of flowers will be pre-
sented to the jockey, Oliver Lewis,
who spurred the winner home.
Then the couples in a figure will
waltz away to the tune of “Jean-
nie With the Light Brown Hair.”

The setting will be complete
with Churchill downs in the
distance, Pickaninnies, whittling
on the rail fence that surrounds
the gardens, guests drinking mint
juleps ‘(ginger ale) served by
Pompey, the Federal Hill butler.
And, of course, there will be a
stable boy.

After the opening formalities
have been observed, Kay Kyser
will offer the sweet sounds of
some of his most popular melo-
dies, eg. Blue Rain, The Little
Fox, Monstro the Whale, Honest
John, I'm Fit To Be Tied, Happy
Rirthday to Love, and I've Made
the Greatest Discovery.

Kyser, who recently returned
from Hollywood after completing
his picture, “That's Right—
You're Wrong,” is now taking it
easy with one top-flight radio
show a week—his “College of
Musical Knowledge” over NBC-——
and an occasional theatre ap-
pearance.

Kyser last played a stand here
for final ‘36 when he was just
gaining top-rank reputation, and
numerous set leaders have un-
successfully attempted to sign
him for a repeat engagement.

Ginny Simms, blue-eyed vocal-
ist, Sully Mason, Harry Babbitt,
and Ish Kabibble form the roster
of singers which will accompany
his 13-piece orchestra to Lexing-

Bob Chester's torrid swing

Happy After Biggest Swindle
In Annals of Fancy Dress Set

Love conquers all. Even libel
suits, suits for invasion of priv-
acy, alienation of affections, im-
personation, fradulent use of the
mails, the Mann Act—anything
you can think of. Little Cupid
saved two W&L adventurers a
maximum of $10,000 in laweyrs’
fees, fines, and bribery fees to get
out of jail sentences.

Seven hundred miles is a long
way for anyone to come to Fancy
Dress—even if you’ve known the
fellow all your life and think he’s
the finest boy in the world. But
to come 700 miles and find you’ve
got a date with a boy you never
saw or heard of before, a boy
who been writing you for three
months under the name of an
old sweetheart of yours, a boy
who has been slinging a line via
the U. S. mails as thick as some
of these heavy woolen Fancy
Dress costumes, a boy who has
libeled the good name of every-
one you ever mentioned in your
correspondence — that’s bad.
Migthy bad. Bad enough to col-
lect a sizeable sum in any court
in the land. But there’s a girl
out at the Lambda Chi house
who underwent every one of these
atrocities—and stil more—and is
having the time of her life—not
angry at all. It must be love. We
can't see it any other way.

The offender is Scott Smither,
alias Scott Smitherman. The
lovely young thing is Caroline
Mays, of Mississippi State Col-
lege for Women.

Three months ago Caroline was
thinking over the list of her old
beaus and happened to remember
Scott, whom she hadn't seen in
three years. Hearing that he was
at W&L, she wrote him. Since no
Scott Smitherman ever saw the
inside of Washington Hall, Scott
Smither got the letter. Puzzled as
to what to do with it, and never

“2

 

having heard of anyone at
MSCW, he approached his room-
mate as to what to do with it.
Then the trouble started.

Roommates getting each other
in trouble as they always do,
Scott’s jumped on the letter like
it was a $1,000 bill and beat out
a letter in return, libeling all the
old friends she asked about and
warming things up with a nice,
thick lot of bull.

Caroline, thinking she had at
last found her long lost Smither-
man, replied; correspondence
flew rapidly, and she finally sent
the privacy invaders a picture.
It was beautiful—so what do the
offenders of every code of justice
and morals do but ask her up
to Fancy Dress. She accepted at
once.

Then the worry sessions start-
ed. Exams went by unnoticed as
they beat their heads against
stone walls hour after hour. How
were they to break the news.
And what were they to do when
she found out and flew at them
like a mad hen. Thick was the
gloom at the LXA house.

She hit town early this morn-
ing. Stumblingly they managed
to get out the truth. She was
shocked—that’'s the best word we
can find for it. But after hours
of haranguing around they
finally persuaded her to go out
to the house. There the house-
mother added the good cause of
placating her.

Finally she came out of stun-
ned trance, realized it was a great
dance after all and now is just
about the happiest, gayest date
on the campus. Look for her
at the dance tonight—Caroline
Mays. The only way we can

figure it out is it must be love.

But just where is the bona-
fide Smitherman now. He may
sue yet.

World War I! affected Fancy Dress but did not cause its discontinuation. The 1943 Fancy Dress Ball
had as its theme “The American Spirit,” and the set was two nights instead of the usual three. The
pageant had not lost its glamour, however, as students dressed themeselves as military heroes from
1776 to 1918 and danced to the sounds of one of the better bands around, Jack Teagarden and hia

Sounds of Forties’ Swing Era

Derived From Depression Jazz

By THE BIG APPLE

A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-
I gotta gal in Kalamazoo
A real tipperoo...

Believe it or not these lyrics are
to one of the hottest songs heard
in the “soda-shop” and on such
radio programs as ‘‘Let’s Dance,”
in 1941. These are the opening
lines to ‘‘Kalamazoo”’ written and
recorded by Glenn Miller and
his orchestra. Miller’s music is
representative of the decade of
1935 to 1945, a period known as
the “Swing Era.”

And although swing music was
sold as a “new” kind of music—
with all the high-pressure tactics
of modern publicity it was actu-
ally a simple modification of
black jazz into a more fashion-
able and fuller sound of the big
bands. It was brought to the
attention of the public in the
press and at movies, on the juke-
box and on the radio.

In Kalamazoo

The phrase and the sounds of

swing music are back today.
Again with the aid of the same
media, the same promoters are
trying to sell the ‘new’ music.
But actually what Stan Rubin
played in the forties, and what
he will regurgitate tomorrow
night at Fancy Dress is the
logical consolidation of what had
been done prior to swing music.

Among collegians, jazz has al-
ways found a home. During the
early years of the Depression the
five man bands of Louis Arm-
strong and Duke Ellington were
most popular. They were small
and because the entertainers
were black, they were cheap.

Similarly, the college crowd of
the late sixties enjoyed black
music again. This time a little
bit more professional — The
Supremes and The Fourtops re-
vived the New Orleans four beat
smooth-flowing style. With cost
factors of electrical equipment
so high, both sould and all pop
music was limited in size.

But the vociferous markets of
the forties and the seventies were
not satisfied. The jitterbuggers,

Oh whata gal!

The tricks of making a big
band swing is amazingly simple.

The thirteen musicans of the
band are divided into teams or
sections: brass (5), reeds (4) and
rhythm (4). The rhythm section
backs up all the others with a
steady pulse. The _ repeated
phrases, which the brass and
reed sections throw back and
forth give it the swing motion.
This timing is known as ‘riffing.’

Riffs developed into a fine art,
chorus after chorus. The words
to swing music (as silly as the
lyric to any popular music) are
written in poetic iambic meter to
give the head the same beat that
the feet are getting.

In a sense, the swing music

WésL finds wins scarce in February

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports [Editor

While the month of December
held little else than victories for
Washington and Lee’s winter
athletic teams, February has seen
W&L wins a lot harder to come
by.

Only the Generals’ swimming
team continued its winning ways
over the past two weeks, nipping
Virginia Military in a dual meet
on February 5 and placing a
strong fifth in the Virginia State
Swimming Championships this
past weekend,

Meanwhile W&L’'s slumping
basketball team took a ride on
a win-loss roller coaster, sand-
wiching a pair of wins over
Eastern Mennonite and Emory
and Henry between losses to na-
tionally-ranked Old Dominion,
Lynchburg, and Hampden-Syd-
ney.

And W&L's wrestlers weren't
much luckier, placing second in
the VCAA Championships on
February 8 before dropping three
of four meets on a _ southern
swing over the Washington Holi-
day.

A day-by-day summary of the
past two weeks:

FEBRUARY 5—W&L_ swim-
mers took the meet’s final event,
the 400-yard freestyle relay, to
record a 60-53 win over neigh-
boring Virginia Military Institute.

Wé&L captain Will Brotherton
came from behind on the anchor
leg of the relay to win it for
the Generals, who were hard-
pressed to beat a psyched-up
VMI team.

Brotherton earlier
the 200-yard butterfly.

Freshman John Hudson won
three events, the 200-, 500-, and
1650-yard freestyles, while sopho-
more Tad Van Leer won the 50-
and 100-yard freestyles.

FEBRUARY 6—Old Dominion,
the eighth ranked team in the
Associated Press College Divi-
sion rankings, handed W&L its
first home loss of the 1974-75
season, 92-64.

only one of six games on the
road prior to their trip to Lex-
ington, put the game away with
a 15-2 spurt early in the first
half to go ahead 23-11.

The Generals never got with-
iu 11 points of their vistors after
the scoring binge, but stayed
within 16 throughout most of
the second half. Not until the
final moments did ODU run their
lead toward the final margin of
28 points.

Jeff Fuhrmann led five Mon-
archs in double figures with 20
points. Senior guard Oliver Pur-
nell added 16 points and eight
assists, while 6'9" sophomore
Wilson Washington, the much
heralded transfer from Maryland,
collected 15 points, 15 rebounds,
and four blocked shots.

Norm Kristoff played his best
game of the year for W&L, finish-
ing with 17 points, 11 rebounds,
and three blocks.

Greg Croghan added 13 points,
while Bowman Williams and
John Podgajny scored 11 and 10
points each.

FEBRUARY 8—Three W&L
wrestlers grabbed individual
championships as the Generals
placed second at the VCAA
Wrestling Championships at
Fairfax, Va.

W&L had a chance for the
team title, but heavyweight
Steve Schweizerhof dropped his
linal match to Virginia State's
Curtis Pleasents, 7-1, to give
Madison the team crown, 77!
to 74.

W&L's individual winners were
Howdy Knipp (118), Jim Crytzer
(158), and Doug Ford (177).

Meanwhile the basketball Gen-
erals broke their three-game los-
ing streak with an 84-74 win
over Eastern Mennonite in
a VCAA conference game.

The win upped the Western
Division leading Generals’ con-
ference record to 4-0. It also
brought an end to the Royals’
seven-game win streak.

W&L never trailed in the game,
jumping out to a 10-point lead
early in the first half before
settling for a nine-point lead at
intermission, 46-37.

The Generals led by as many
as 15 points in the second half
before EMC rallied to cut the
lead to 77-74 with four minutes

Then the W&L defense stiffen-
ed to shut out the Royals the
rest of the way while Norm
Kristoff threw in five of W&L’s
last seven points to put the
game away.

Greg Croghan led the Gen-
erals’ with 18 points. Six-foot-
nine sophomore Don Berlin
added 15, and Kristoff chipped
in with 14 points and 12 re-
bounds,

Bill Megginson and Pat Bopp
scored 14 points each for East-
ern Mennonite.

FEBRUARY 11—As was the
case the past two years, Lynch-
burg College was waiting for the
Generals to visit their gymnas-
ium, and responded with a 66-57
win to avenge an earlier loss to
W&L in Lexington Doremus Gym.

The Hornets won the game at
the foul line, sinking 24 of 36
charity tosses while W&L con-
nected on only three of their
seven foul shots.

While W&L controlled the
boards, 55-35, and got off more
shots from the field, they could
not get the big basket when they
needed it, and the Hornets
capitalized on several opportuni-
ties to pull away in the game’s
late minutes.

Freshman guard Tom Selinger
led the Hornets with 19 points.

Don Berlin scored 19 for W&L,
while John Podgajny added 18.

FEBRUARY 12—The basket-
ball Generals bounced back from
their loss at Lynchburg to re-
cord a 72-67 VCAA conference
win over Emory and Henry.

The win was the first on the
road for W&L snce they defeat-
ed Bridgewater on January 22
at Bridgewater. Since then the
Generals had dropped four
straight games away from Do-
remus Gym.

The Generals led by as many
as 15 points in the second half,
only to have several errors in

Wasps opportunities to close the
gap.

Guy Kerr led W&L with 16
points and eight rebounds. Greg
Croghan added 12 points while
John Podgajny chipped in 10.

W&L enjoyed its best shoot-
ing night in some time, hitting
on 50 percent of its shots from
the floor, while converting 24 of
34 from the foul line.

The win upped W&L’s confer-
ence-leading record to 5-0.

FEBRUARY 13 — W&L's
wrestling team _ started its
Florida trip by splitting a pair
of dual meets, beating Southern
Tech, 30-9 while dropping a 28-
3 decision to Maryville College.

Lee Keck (134), Brian Tray
(142), and Bill Cole (190) record-
ed pins for W&L against South-
ern Tech, while Howdy Knipp
(118), Don Overdorff (126), Jim

Crytzer (158), and Steve Sch-
weizerhof (HVY) scored de-
cisions.

Tray was the lone winner for
W&L against Maryville.

Meanwhile in Lexington fresh-
man swimmer John Hudson be-
gan his assault on the record
books as the Virginia Intercol-
legiate Swimming and Diving
Championships got underway.

Hudson set school, meet, and
state records in the 500-yard free-
style with a time of 4:44.27,
more than 10 seconds better
than second place finisher Mark
Kutz of Virginia Commonwealth.

Hudson's time is also the fast-
est recorded by a swimmer in
NCAA-Divisions II and III this
year.

Meanwhile sophomore Tad
Van Leer set a school record of

Florida Tech.

The hosts recorded one pin,

Construction is proceeding at a rapid pace on the Woods Creek
apartment complex, to be completed in time for Fall Term.

By JOE FITZGERALD

The Executive Committee
voted Monday night, Feb. 10, to
replace the present public honor
trial procedure with an adversary
system by placing an E.C. mem-
ber in the hearing as “prosecu-
tor’ to present the case against
the accused.

The E.C. also voted to give the
transcript of the private E.C.
hearing to the defense and com-
mittee advocates but to withhold
it from the jury.

In another change the E.C.
decided to allow the advisors of
the accused to ask questions in
the public hearing instead of let-
ting only the accused himself
interrogate witnesses.

The E.C. based its authority to
make the changes on responses
to survey sheets circulated in a
three-month campaign to elicit
student opinion on the state of
the honor system. The survey
sheets were the only sizeable in-
put received by the committee
concerning the honor code.

The E.C. began the Feb. 10
meeting by deciding by a two

the Woodrow Wilson Founda-

Bird will meet and work with

liam’s office, Room 1, and he
may be contacted at his apart-
ment at the Withrow House,
where the telephone number is
463-4832.

Bird is a 1939 graduate of
Yale with a major in economics,
and joined Mobil in 1943. Before
assuming his current duties, he
was manager of marketing for
the company in Colombia, presi-
dent of Mobil’s Mexico subsidi-
ary, regional director for Latin
America and later for the Com-
mon Market nations, senior vice
president of the international di-
vision, vice president for Latin
America, and vice president for
the parent corporation in charge
of public affairs.

The particular fields of in-
terest Bird intends to explore
with students include needs,
junctions and future of multi-
national companies; relation-
ships between business and gov-
ernment, both generally and with
oil companies especially; special
problems with developing nations
and with peoples of other na-
tions; and business decision-mak-
ing on an international seale.

Bird also will provide an in-
sider’s view of the energy crisis—
how it developed, how it feels to
be “in the center of the storm,”
as he puts it, and “what seems
to be the way out of the prob-
lem” from both the domestic
and foreign points of view.

Bird says that after college, “I
deliberately chose a career in
international business—and I
was also especially attracted to
the oil business because of its
fundamental importance. Even
then energy seemed to me to be
indispensable and a sound basis
for a eareer,”

Street Week.” A live broadcast,
“Wall Street Week" deals with
controversial subjects, from
pornography to philosophy. John
J. Conner of the New York Times
once said that the show dealt
with “certain subjects that did
not lend themselves to television.”
Thus, the show seems to be
breaking the usual protocol and
reveling in the resulting static.
Rukeyser’s show has been called
“a refreshing change in a period
when television seems to be
weighed down with its own
technology.” Of his own show,
Mr. Rukeyser says, “I look at it
as a kind of Sesame Street for
erownups.”

Mr. Rukeyser was originally
scheduled to speak to the Com-
merce Fraternity on the after-
noon of his arrival, but this plan
has been cancelled owing to
transportation problems. He will,
however, arrive in Lexington in
time to attend the reception in
his honor at the Pi Kappa Alpha
house at 5:00 p.m.

é EC alters honor system

thirds majority that a two third
majority would be needed to pass
any motion for changes in the
honor system.

The first question considered
was whether appeals of E.C.
honor rulings should be public
or private. Sophomore repre-
sentative Sandy Stradtman cited
for purposes of debate that jurors
acting in public might tend to
judge the case from what they
thought the students wanted in-
stead of basing their decision on
the facts.

Stradtman mentioned that the
E.C. should consider whether
fairness to the accused should
take precedence over the educa-
tion to be ga’ned by the E.C. and
the students : a public trial. The
E.C. felt that publicity did not
compromise the equity of the
proceeding and voted unanim-
ously to keep the appeals public.

The group then turned to the
discussion of the need for a
prosecutor in public trials. Sec-
retary Mike Luttig argued
against the idea of an adversary
system, saying he would like to
keep “people against people”
situations out of the trials.

Senior representative Woody
Ray argued that the idea of a
publie trial was to give the ac-
cused a review of the case, not
to protect the E.Cc. and its
original ruling. He said those
members of the committee who
favored an adversary system were
acting “paranoid” and added, “I
don't feel threatened.”

Junior representative Robert
Pugh answered Luttig’s earlier
statement, saying the present
public trial system is a “circus
without the elephants” in that
it places the accused on one side
and places the jury both in the
middle and on the other side.
Vice-president Bob Keatley said
that the present system is basic-
ally a conflict between the de-
fendant and the transcript of
the E.C. hearing. He said the

defendant, with the help of his
advisors, could take testimony
from the transcript out of con-
text and create a “smokescreen”
around the actual meaning of the
original testimony.

The motion to have a prose-
cutor in the public trials carried
by a three-quarters majority,
with Luttig and Ray not voting.

Debate on the issue of who
should be prosecutor was based
on written propositions present-
ed by members of the E.C.
Senior Law representative Steve
Robinson gave an argument in
favor of choosing a prosecutor
independent of the E.C. The
argument said in part that the
public trial is as much “a trial
of the E.C. and its ruling” as it
is a trial of the accused.

Freshman Law representative
Everett Martin and Junior
Representative Leland McCul-
lough presented an argument in
favor of an E.C. member as
prosecutor. Martin said an E.C.
prosecutor would be “less theatri-
cal” and would “expedite the
trial” in that he would share the
defense advisor’s advantage of
having been at the original
hearing.

Straditman again played the
Devil's advocate, asking if an
independent prosecutor would do
any more or less good than an
E.C. representative. Keatley an-
swered that an _ independent
prosecutor would just be trying
the case before him, not “de-
fending his judgement.”

A motion that one or two E.C.
members should represent the
committee at public honor trials
was carried by another three-
quarters majority. Keatley and
Freshman representative Elliot
Hicks did not vote.

A motion concerning tran-
scripts of E.C. honor hearings
carried unanimously. The motion
allowed for transcripts of the
hearing to be given to the prose-
cutor and defendant for use in

Number 17

preparing their cases and also
in case testimony in the public
trial conflicted with that in the
original hearing.

The motion also provided that
the transcripts not be given to
the jury. This rule was passed
in the hope of giving the de-
fendant a new trial instead of
just rehashing the original evi-
dence.

The E.C. voted Monday night,
Feb. 17, to change the wording
of one of the questions asked of
prospective jurors for a public
honor trial and to allow unlimit-
ed questioning of jurors-design-
ate from both accused and E.C.
advocates.

The decision followed debate
over whether questioning the
ability of students to judge their
peers impartially was not in fact
challenging the honor of the
potential jurors, According to
Bob Keatley, the E.C. would be
“dealing with something that’s
dead in the first place” if they
had to question the integrity of
randomly selected jurors.

Mike Luttig followed up Keat-
ley’s objection, asking, “Is that
something the E.C. should con-
we don’t do it, no one will.” He
trol?” Steve Robinson replied, “If
cited the fact that four or five
jurors in an honor trial last
Spring were fraternity brothers
of the accused.

All E.C, members except Keat-
ley and Luttig voted to ask each
prospective juror, “Do you know
the accused personally?” instead
of the question now in the White
Book “Do you know the accused
well enough that you would judge
this matter differently than one
involving a total stranger?”

The E.C. also voted, with Keat-
ley oposed, to allow questions
from both sides during the
selection of jurors, and to allow
each side to reject two jurors
without cause. The decision to
allow two pre-emptory strikes
was carried unanimously.

11 journalists to gather

for symposium on ethics

A four-day institute on journ-
alism ethics for working news-
men is set for next week here
as part of W&L's new program in
the professional ethies of journ-
alism.

Ben H. Bagdikian, assistant
managing editor and “ombuds-
man” of the Washington Post
until 1972, will deliver a public
address Monday evening and will
participate in workshops with
students and the visiting journ-
alists as part of the institute.

Bagdikian's lecture will be en-
titled “Is There Life After Water-
gate?” and will take place in
Lee Chapel at 8 p.m. Members
of the general public are in-
vited to attend at no charge.

The institute and Bagdikian's
visit to Washington and Lee
have been made possible by the
$300,000 grant to W&L from the
Lilly Endowment of Indianapolis.
That grant was designated to
establish programs in pre-profes-
sional ethics in law, medicine and
journalism and to establish a
similar program in the field of
the responsibilities of corpora-

tions in contemporary society.

The four-day program will al-
low eleven journalists and news-
men to investigate problems of
ethics—reflected in the value
judements they are required to
make on a day-to-day basis—in
an academic setting, making use
of W&L’'s library resources, and
the formal and informal activi-
ties of the program such as the
workshops and classes which are
part of W&L's journalism cur-
riculum.

As “ombudsman” at the Post,
Bagdikian was responsible for
evaluating and criticizing the
newspaper's performance as the
advocate of the readership. His
critical observations were fre-
quently published on the paper's
editorial page.

Among journalists participat-
ing in the institute will be four
W&L graduates—Lewis Cope of
the Minneapolis Tribune, Jay
Denny of WDBJ-TYV in Roanoke,
Raymond J. MeGrath of the
Charlottesville Daily Progress,
and Lawson H. Marshall of the
Lynchbure News,

tions should plan to appear
for an interview before the
Publications Board at a later
date to be announced.

Applications should in-
clude:

—A brief letter of intent
stating the position for which
you will apply.

—Ten copies of a personal
resume containing academic
