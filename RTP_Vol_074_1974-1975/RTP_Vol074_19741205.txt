Fancy Dress not to be effected

SAB loses $5000 on SHF concert

By STEVE YEVICH

The Student Activities Board
lost about $5000 on the Souther-
Hillman-Furay concert in the
New Doremus Gym on November
20th.

Exact figures have not yet
been compiled, but it was esti-
mated by the SAB that about
500 people attended the concert,
accounting for roughly $2000 in
ticket sales.

Volume LXXIV

Total expenses incurred in
bringing the band to Lexington
amounted to $7100, according to
John Killpack, Chairman of the
SAB. Thus his committee had to
spend about $5000 out of its own
budget for the concert.

While the loss was substantial,
the activities board had appropri-
ated $7500 in its budget to cover
the anticipated deficit for the fall
concert. Total losses on all activi-

ties this year have been $6500,
including the $5000, so the SAB
has a surplus of $1000 at the
moment.

The rumors that the Fancy
Dress budget will be cut to cover
the costs of the November con-
cert are unsubstantiated, said
Killpack. The SAB knew it would
lose money on the concert and
planned its budget accordingly.
However, if there had been bet-
ter atendance, extra money would

have been made available to
spend on Fancy Dress.

Killpack said that the SAB is
caught in a painful dilemma re-
garding concerts: bands cannot
be brought on weekends, as a
rule, because of the high costs
involved, and yet weekend at-
tendance would be good. On the
other hand, weeknight costs are
lower, but students cannot seem
to afford the time, as shown by
the recent concert.

Three VMI students escaped
death Sunday when they missed
the Trans-World Airlines flight
514 that crashed outside Wash-
ington, aecording to Mrs. Julia
Martin of the VMI Public In-
formation Office.

Mrs. Martin said two students,
including John Willison of the
VMI footbal squad, cancelled
their reservations on the flight
Sunday morning when they
found a ride to Lexington with
another eadet from Ohio.

The third cadet, John Lach of
Palmer, Ohio, was a stand-by
passenger who was “bumped”
from the flight shortly before
takeoff.

All 92 persons on board the
‘TWA flight died when the plane
went down at Upperville, Va., 20
miles from Dulles Airport, due to
bad weather.

NOTICE
Dr. James G. Leyburn will
be speaking in Lee Chapel
this Sunday as part of the
weekly worship service. His
topic is “What is that in
your hand?” The service be-

eins at 11:00 a.m.

came effective this past Novem-
ber 19.

The new amendment, discuss-
ed at great lengths in the past
faculty meeting, provides the
student with access to any rec-
ords concerning him and forbids
schools to release any informa-
tion on the student to anyone
but himself, except with the stu-
dent’s permission (‘i.e., grades
must be sent to students instead
of parents.)

In addition, when requested,

the college has 45 days to re-
lease to a student his records.
President Robert E. R. Huntley
announced that W&L will re-
spond to students’ requests on a
case by case basis. Furthermore,
all high school recommendations
will be destroyed following ad-
mission decisions on perspective
students.

The Education lobby, however,
led by institutions with which
W&L is affiliated, has been at-
tempting to put through an

amendment that will exclude the
letters of recommendations.

President Huntley also pointed
out that parents of W&L stu-
dents will be sent a letter in-
forming them that federal law
will not allow the school to send
them grades. A form will be en-
closed, nonetheless, so that the
student may allow his grades to
be sent to his parents. He has
also noted that the school will
take no position on professor and
grade recommendations.

Yes, Virginia, the Wé&L faculty

is good for something else

Although some might think
that the faculty at Washington
and Lee does nothing at ali
except go to cocktail parties and
attend a few of their own classes,
there a few notable exceptions.
The accomplishments of Doctors
DeVogt and Phillips of eco-
nomics and Stuart of the English
department have shown that they
ean display their intellectual
prowess off the campus as well
as on.

John F. DeVogt, head of the
administration department, is
the new president of the South-
ern Managment Associaiton. Dr.
DeVoget was installed in his new
post in the third week in No-
vember at the association’s an-
nual meeting in Atlanta, Ga.

A W&L professor of economics.
Dr. Charles F. Phillips Jr., was
a panel leader in seminars on
regulated utilities in California
and Indiana last month. At the
three-day seminar on utility fi-

nance and economics in Los
Angeles Dr. Phillips was joined
by such notable figures as Herb-
ert Stein, former chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisors,
and Lindsey Clark, economic
news editor of the Wall Street
Journal. Dr. Phillips is also the
author of two books: Economics
of Regulation and Competition in
the Domestic Telecommunica-
tions Industry.

Two collections of poems by
Dabney Stuart of the English
department have just been pub-
lished. One is The Other Hand,
published by Louisiana State Uni-

lection of poems for children
entitled Friends of Yours,
Friends of Mine, published by
Rainmaker Press of Richmond.
The new volumes are the third

dent to help in reducing the
burdens placed by the atlling
economy upon himeecl!

If students would only realize
this and support the weeknight
concerts, Killpack said, more and
better bands could be attracted.

Another problem confronting
the SAB in scheduling concerts is
the fact that most bands are
seeking exposure more than the
money. And so W&L faces the
problem of having groups like
the Beach Boys shunning Lex-
ington for larger audiences. Kill-
pack said that his committee

could afford one or more “big-
name” concerts a year, but it is
hard to convince the “big-names”
to play in this part of the Valley
because of the small size of
W&L.

Killpack denied the rumor that
there was a private party after
the concert paid for with pro-
ceeds from ticket sales: ‘We
{members of SAB] stayed around
and cleaned up until 1:30 a.m.,
if you call that a party.”

Phi Gamma Delta fraternity for
not filing a tax exempt status
form within the required period,
according to Mrs. Mary Lowuery.

status form 990 to the IRS in
Philadelphia no later than Janu-
ary 31, 1974, said Mrs. Lowuery
She added that she had pre-
pared and given the form to last
year's treasurer on Nov. 3, 1973,
but that the IRS did not receive
the form until March 30. 1974
“The treasurer must have been

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

 

Preserving the
Honor System

The honor trial which came earlier in the fall initiated
discussion on the procedures and effectiveness of the Honor
Code. Appropriate reforms are now being sought by the Stu-
dent Executive Committee to make the System fairer and
more equitable for both the student body and the accused,

The discussion which was aroused has proved profitable
for all of us. The fact that students are showing their interest
and willingness to express their views on the subject is cer-
tainly gratifying for those of us who feel that the Honor
System is an integral part of life at Washington and Lee.

While the spirit moves us we would like to issue a note of
caution. Nothing can be 100 per cent perfect. That which is
predominantly good should be preserved in lieu of adopting
another from which may well prove to be worse than that
which it replaces. Although some imbalances in the Honor
System became apparent in the course of the last public trial
and should be corrected, the Honor System is basically
sound-—theoretically.

Immediately after the last trial we raised the question of
whether the student jury was capable of standing as the
sentinel of the Honor System. We are still quite far from being
convinced that the public jury is a good thing. On the other
hand, it should be preserved until the students lose confidence
in it as an institution, It appears to us at this point that the
majority of the student body maintains that he public jury
is valuable. That being the case, we would expect that it will
remain and, hopefully, live to see better days ahead.

The Honor System owes its whole existance to the belief
of the student body that it is a necessary and integral part of
life at Washington and Lee. It relies on our faith in it and
thus cannot be regarded as other institutions. We insert this
to explain that although we do not find aspects of it accept-
able we feel that as long as any part of it is supported by
the student body it should be kept. The Honor System is not
really a practical or realistic institution—it is idealistic and
should be treated as such.

Another part of the Honor Code which we hope will not
be compromised is the idea of the absolute penalty. As has
been said before, cither a person is honest or dishonest—there
is no such thing as being a little bit dishonest. To suggest that
the absolute penalty be replaced by a graduated penalty sys-
tem is comparable to suggesting that Pandora open her box
just a little: impossible. If we are to have an Honor Code
it must be based on the understanding that the students want
to live in an environment in which they can safely assume
that their peers are honest, not somewhat honest, which implies
the rational for the absolute penalty.

Outrage

Upon returning from Thanksgiving vacation most people
realized, if they had not done so already, that exams were
only days away. Thus the Great Cram began with the influx
of students last Sunday.

—J.L.R.

For many, last Sunday was a day of feverish activity if
not one of horrifying frustration with the prospects of be-
ginning courses one week before exams. As if this were not
bad enough, insult was added to injury by the fact that the
Co-op failed to open at the appointed hour, ie., 7:30 p.in,
The reaction of many students to this gross injustice was
one of moral outrage.

Perhaps the failure of the Co-op to open was a result of
a conspiracy on the part of professors to bring grade inflation
to a grinding halt by frustrating the students to death. At
any rate, such an occurance brings to mind the worst excesses
of the French Revolution and should not become a frequently
utilized form of harassment,

An analysis

By PAUL LANCASTER
Phi Managing [Editor

Editor’s note—This is the fifth
and last of a series of articles on
grading at Washington and Lee.
This week, Ring-tum Phi man-
aging editor Paul J. Lancaster
wraps up his look on grading,
with a look at an alternative to
Washington and Lee’s current
grading system,

. a oo

Grades are up. Graduate
schools simply cannot take a
fair look at a person’s grades and
determine if that person should
be admitted. One man’s 3.0 is
superior in one school; it’s aver-
age in another. One man’s 3.0 is
superior in one department at
Washington and Lee; it’s aver-
age in another.

Grades have long been regard-
ed as one of the best gauges of
how a student will perform in
post-graduate employment or
studies. For years, many gradu-
ate schools could trust that a 3.0
meant the student was doing
superior work in college. But no
more.

To mention a few statistics to
back this contention: the aver-
age mark at Stanford is a 3.5;
the nationwide grade point ratio
has risen by more than .4 in the
last 10 years; more than one-

third of the senior undergradu-
ate class at Washington and Lee
will be graduated next May with
honors. How can a graduate
school put as much an emphasis
on grades as it did in the past?

So the graduate school looks
to other criteria with which he
can judge a student’s abilities.
First, there are faculty recom-
mendations. But to be a little
more accurate, there were fac-
ulty recommendations.

Many graduate schools will
no longer accept recommenda-
tions from a student’s college
professors. The reason? A bill
enacted in Congress recently
enables a student to examine all
data on the student which is
held by the school. Thus con-
fidential letters of recommenda-
tion are no longer confidential
and professors are reluctant to
write letters which may be seen
by the student. All recommenda-
tions that are written may soon
be good recommendations, and
the value of this as a gauge for
student ability will be lost.

Then there are the scores of
standardized tests. As treacher-
ous as the thought might be to
some students, the prospect is
for increasing emphasis on stand-
ardized tests as a gauge of stu-
dent ability. It is certainly uni-

form, unlike grades; there are
no student-faculty politics in-
volved, unlike letters of recom-
mendations.

There is a fourth criterion
here, one that has been almost
totally ignored by graduate
schools and employers, and one
that indeed could serve as an
alternative to, or a complement
of, grading. That criterion is class
rank.

Indeed, class rank is currently
a major criterion of undergradu-
ate schools in considering appli-
cants from high schools. Like-
wise, graduate schools could see
the student’s grade point ratio in
the meaningful context of class
rank. Certainly, a student rank-
ing fifth in his class with a 3.45
has achieved more than a student
who is ranked 45th in a class the
same size and who carries a 3.5.

Class rank would at least begin
to lessen the differences among
the grading systems of different
schools. But what about differ-
ences among the grading systems
of various departments? All else
being equal, any given student
majoring in fine arts has a com-
paratively better chance of be-
ing graduated among the top
10—or even the top 100—than
does the politics major at Wash-
ington and Lee. How is such

Letters to the editor...

Over-reacting

Recent remarks by General
Brown and Secretary Butz have
been termed as unfortunate and
even racist by various columnists
in the national news media. Gen-
eral Brown spoke of the Jewish
influence in America and Con-
gress, saying that it is too power-
ful. Secretary Butz, in a mock
Italian accent, critized Pope
Paul's stand on birth control in
underdeveloped nations. Admit-
tedly their comments were not
overly tactful considering their
high government posts. However,
the real unfortunate occurance
is the over-reaction of the press
and the American people.

There has been a similar situa-
tion at W&L this year. A group
of members of SABU (‘Student
Association for Black Unity)
visited the residence of the
writer of “Ask Traveller” de-
manding an explanation of his
remarks on the social life of
black students at W&L. Within
the context of the article the re-
marks about their serving mint
puleps were obviously meant in a
humorous manner, not to be
taken seriously. A public apology
from “Traveller” appeared in the
next issue of the Phi.

It is a sad situation indeed
when in our country today a
religious or ethnic group reacts
to comments or jokes of these

sorts in such a defensive man-
ner. A harmless quip about an
ethnic minority is viewed as be-
ing racist or even anti-American.
On the other hand a biting slur
or a cynical denunciation direct-
ed towards white middle-class
Americans is deemed perfectly
acceptable, if not in vogue. I feel
there is something very wrong
with this vast discrepancy in
attitudes.

Student finds
Honor System weak

I know I am going to hell when
I die, so I have no reservations
when I say, “I'll be damned if
any student in the University will
swear he has not committed an
honor violation.” Take to heart
two, of many, examples; lieing to
buy liquor or stealing athletic
equipment.

I for one will admit to having
committed honor violations. And
thought I don’t relish the thought
of being kicked out of W&L for
these acts, I must say that if
I am not kicked out of W&L
then the Honor Code is dead or
at least dormant.

I write this letter regretfully
because I wish the honor system
could only operate as simply as
its ideals are stated. We are all
human and the Honor System is

Reading skills program offered

As a service to students, the
University has once again this
year engaged Baldridge Reading
and Study Skills, Inc. to offer
on campus a special program de-
signed to improve reading and
learning skills in academic sub-
jects.

This program will be con-
ducted on the Washington and
Lee campus by an instructor
from Baldridge Reading from
January 13 through February 7.
Scheduling will be flexible to
accommodate individual student
schedules, and classes will be

small to permit necessary indi-
vidual attention. Each student
will attend a total of twenty ses-
sions, five per week. Tuition for
the program will be $95, pay-
able by the start of the pro-
gram upon receipt of a state-
ment from Baldridge.

Further information and
registration cards may be ob-
tained from the Office of the
Dean of Stuednts, Washington
Hall 25. Interested students
should register for the course as
soon as possible.

A viable alternative to grades?

inequity within a university over-
come?

One answer, suggested by
Washington and Lee economics
professor John Gunn, would be
to rank each student in each
course he takes at Washington
and Lee. Rank in a given class
would be determined by a stu-
dent’s overall performance in in-
dividual courses. Thus, in the
class of 1975, for example, the
student who has finished first in
all of his courses would be ranked
first in his class. Class rank
would be determined by average
course standing.

According to Professor Gunn,
all the averaging out could be
handled easily by the university’s
computer. The computer could
be used to set up a “power fac-
tor” of sorts. If a student has
done well, ranking among the
top 20 percent of all his previous
courses, and he then takes a
course and finishes with a rank
in the third fifth of the class,
this would contribute to the
power factor. Such an occur-
rence, if continually repeated by
other students, would give a
power factor indicating that the
particular course is difficult.

The result, according to Pro-
fessor Gunn, would be that a
student finishing first in the
difficult course would receive a
higher ranking than would the
student finishing first in the
easy course, even if both received
grades of “A”.

The faculty has already held
a brief discussion this year on
the topic of grades, voting to
table any action or further dis-
cussion. For the time being, the
grades will continue to rise. And
grading will continue to be in-
equitable. And graduate schools
and employers will place less em-
phasis on grades and more on
standardized tests. And, in the
long run, the student will suffer.

Give Virginia scare before falling

Generals win two, ‘almost three’

By BILL fr LESHER
Phi Sports editor

In opening their 1974-75 bask-
etball season, Washington and
Lee’s basketball Generals proved
Dick Martin’s old 66.7 percent
adage to be much more than
hot air.

Verne Canfield’s troops posted
a pair of wins in the inaugural
W&L Tip-Off Tournament over
Maryville College, 94-67, and
Frostburg State, 50-49 in double
overtime, before falling to ACC
member Virginia, 77-69, in what
was more of a battle than anyone
in University Hall expected.

All three games showed the
balance Canfield is relying on in
the upcoming season, as the Gen-
erals’ leading scorers were dif-
ferent in each game.

The Frostburg State game, a
thriller in which Guy Kerr sank
a free throw with :03 left in the
second overtime for the win, was
a costly one as 6’ 6” forward
Gary Fitzgerald suffered a frac-
tured left elbow in a fall.

Fitzgerald, who led W&L with
17 points in the Maryville game,
will be out from four to six
weeks.

W&L's season opener was any-
thing but incomplete.

It took a while for the Gen-
erals to shake off the tension
that had built up, but eventually
they wore down Maryville Col-
lege, finally running away in the
second half for a 94-67 win.

W&L put the Scots away with
a 36-13 splurge in the final
eleven minutes. Maryville had
hung tough up to that point,
trailing by only 38-30 at inter-
mission, and by just 58-54 before
the Generals turned on the gas.

Seven W&L players’ scored
eight or more points, led by
junior forward Gary Fitzgerald’s
17 markers.

Junior Guard John Podgajny,
who sparked W&L in the first
half with 12 points, finished the
game with 14, while senior co-
captanis Guy Kerr and Greg
Croghan added 13 and 10 points
respectively.

Randy Lambert led the Scots
with 17 points.

No formal winner was to be
crowned in the inaugural Tip-
Off Tournament, which was de-
signed as a two-game warmup
for the Generals and Hampden-
Sydney.

As it turned out, the final
game Saturday evening would de-
termine which team would leave
Lexington with an unblemished
record. Frostburg State had dis-
posed of the Tigers on Friday,
and had shown signs of being a
troublesome test for the Gen-
erals.

Troublesome wasn't fitting
enough. The visitors were down-
right pests.

Frostburg parlayed a motley
strategy of fastbreaking, stalling,
good shooting, and tenacious de-
fense to move out to a six-point
lead midway through the first
half. It could have been more
had not the Generals equalled
Frostburg’s job on defensive play.

Late in the half W&L rallied
to earn a 23-all intermission

deadlock, as senior Guard Bow-
man Williams threw in a 25-
footer at the buzzer to even
things up.

The Generals grabbed the up-
per hand early in the second
half, and once led by seven
points. But Frostburg whittled
away at the margin, and Bob
Bidder’s jumped with 2:23 left
evened the score at 43-all, which
is how it stood as regulation time
expired.

Things got less sticky in the
first extra period, as both teams
found points a bit easier to come
by. with :56 left, Frostburg’s Ray-
mond Nelson missed a tie-break-
ing free throw, and, after another
late-second W&L shot missed,
came overtime number two, with
both teams showing 49 points.

W&L's defense dominated the
second extra period, as they held
the visitors without a shot for
the entire five minutes.

The only problem was that the
Generals couldn’t buy a basket at
the same time. Several shots were
in-and-others, others were just
outers.

The big break came with :43
left, when Paul Maloney stole the
ball from Frostburg’s Mitch
Stoller, with :06 left Jeff Baum
fired a shot in the general direc-
tion of the basket. The ball hit
the rim, and came straight down
into the hands of Kerr, who was
fouled as he shot by Frostburg’s
Frazier Nelson.

With Generals’ coach Verne
Canfield about to jump out of
the gym due to nervousness, Kerr

calmly left his first charity toss
on the front of the rim. But the
second one was dead center, and
the Generals were 2-0.

Williams led W&L with 13
points, while Fitzgearld, who left
the game midway through the
second half with an elbow in-
jury, added 12.

Bidder led all scorers with 17
points.

Sample conversation Monday
in Charlottesville’s University
Hall:

“Full house tonight?”

“No way! Who'd want to see
the Hoos beat on W&L like they
have the past few years?”

“IT guess you're right.”

As it turned out, they were far
from on the right track.

For a while it looked like the
peanut gallery’s prophecies might
be on the money, but as the
game went on Virginia’s Cava-
liers found more and more
trouble from the visiting Gen-
erals, seeing what had been a
15-point lead shrink to four late
in the game, before two baskets
by Wally Walker keyed the Wa-
hoos’ final rally for a 77-69 win.

Virginia jumped out to a 6-0
lead with four minutes gone be-
fore a John Podgajny jumper put
W&L on the scoreboard. But
with Bill Langloh and freshman
center Mare Iavaroni leading the
way, the Cavs had stretched their
lead to 27-12 midway through
the first half.

As Virginia fans clamored for
the final surge that would have

put W&L away, the Generals
responded with a spurt of their
own that got them back in the
ball game. W&L’s tenacious man-
to-man defense kept the Cavs
away from the basket, while
deadly shooting from Podgajny
and Guy Kerr brought the Gen-
erals within seven with a minute
left in the half.

But Virginia’s Mark Newlen
converted twice on the end of
fast breaks late in the half, giv-
ing the Cavs a 44-33 lead at
intermission.

Virginia shot a sparkling 71
percent from the floor in the
first twenty minutes, while W&L
hit on only 38 percent of its
shots. As it would turn out, it
was the low percentage from the
field that would cost W&L the
win.

W&L nibbled away at the Cavs
lead in the early minutes of the
second half, closing the gap to
48-40 before field goals by Dan
Bonner, Newlen, and Andy
Boninit gave Virginia a 14-point
lead.

Then W&L roared back with
10 straight points as Bonner and
Iavaroni sat on the bench with
four fouls. The Generals con-

trolled the boards at both ends
of the floor during the five-
minute stretch in which the Hoos
went scoreless. And, before Vir-
ginia’s first-year head coach
Terry Holland could call a time-
out, W&L was within four at 54-
50.

Then the Cavalier veterans
took over. Langloh and Walker
led Virginia in the final ten
minutes, as both scored six points
to put the game out of W&L’s
reach. The Generals came no
closer than six after the Virginia
timeout, as the hosts relied on
their experience and poise to ice
the game away.

Langloh led all scorers with 16
points, while teammates Iavaroni
and Walker chipped in with 14
and 13 points each.

Bonner, starting his first game
for Virginia, went five-for-five
from the field for 10 points.

Podgajny and Croghan led a
balanced scoring attack for
W&L with 14 points each. Kerr
added 13 while sophomore center
Notm Kristoff, playing more
than he had in the first two
games combined, posted 12 points
and led all players with 10 re-
bounds.
