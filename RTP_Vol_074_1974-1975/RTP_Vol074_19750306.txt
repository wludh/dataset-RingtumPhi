Restrictions loosened

on academic probation

By JIM NORTON

A proposal to allow students on
academic probation to hold elec-
tive or appointive positions was
approved by the faculty at their
monthly meeting Monday after-
noon.

The proposal limits students
on academic probation to one ex-
tra-curricular activity but now
allows that activity to be an elec-
tive or appointive office. This
differs from the former rule that
prohibited students on academic
probation from holding any posi-
tion to which one is elected or
appointed.

The proposal, submitted by the
faculty Executive Committee,
differs from the proposal sub-
mitted by the student Executive
Committee that asked for the re-
moval of all restrictions on stu-
dents on academic probation.

In other action the faculty ap-
proved a request from Phi Beta
Kappa to have shortened classes
on March 25 to enable them to
have an assembly. The speaker
at the assembly will be Dr.
Claude 8S. George, Associate Dean
of the School of Business Ad-
ministration at the University of

North Carolina, according to Dr.
DeVogt, faculty advisor of Phi
Beta Kappa.

The faculty also rejected two
different proposals to change the
exam schedule for this term.
Both proposals asked for a
change of the starting date of
exams to Saturday, March 29.

The faculty approved some
course changes, which included
the dropping of Interdepartmen-
tal 302, 303 and 340 in the Spring.
Other changes approved were in
music, drama, economics, French,
computer science and Chinese
courses.

Larry Lyles spoke before the
faculty and thanked them for
their co-operation with the stu-
dent curriculum survey. He said
the results of the fall survey will
be available soon and that the
winter term survey will run from
the 17th to the 21st of March.

The faculty Courses and De-
erees Committee reported that it
is still studying a proposal by Le-
land McCullough, Bill Garrison,
and Robert Pugh to permit stu-
dents to take 9 credits in a 12
week term, if this will not delay
their graduation. The committee
is expected to report next month.

and Sandy Stradtman is running
unopposed for the office of Sec-
retary.

Campaign regulations for the
candidates were set concerning
posters and expenditures. 50 812”
x 11” posters will be allowed each
person running and five larger
displays such as banners and
skywriting. Posters and platforms
displayed together at fraternity
houses will count as one poster.

Candidates will be allowed to
spend $15 each. Expense lists will
be due in the E.C. room by Sun-
day night. Contributions from
others must be counted on the
candidates’ lists. All campaign
regulations will apply to all can-
didates, including write-ins.

Voting will be open to all stu-
dents including seniors and ex-
change students. Polling places
will be located in the Co-op, the
Quad, and Washington and
Tucker Halls.

In other business, John Kill-
pack, speaking for the Student
Activities Board, reported that
the SAB spent $4000 instead of
$6000 on Fancy Dress Weekend.
The SAB also reiterated its re-
quest for $500 to cover bills left
over from last year's film com-
mittee. The E.C. deferred a de-
cision on the funds until a later
date.

The E.C. also went on record as
supporting the Generals in this
weekend's basketball game.

The E.C. also deferred a deci-
sion on what action, if any, to
take concerning student behavior
at Lacrosse games. Ben Bailey
noted that two other schools con-
sidered dropping W&L from their
schedules because of the poor be-
havior of the students. Bailey
noted that this might be con-
sidered an honor violation since
students at the games are not
conducting themselves as gentle-
man.

Drama academy promotes Kahn

By the Phi News Staff

Lee Kahn, assistant fine arts
professor and director of the
University Theatre, is the new
executive vice president of The
American Academy of Dramatic
Arts of New York City.

In that capacity, Kahn has
charge of overseeing professional
training in acting in the school's
two divisions, in New York and
in Pasadena, Calif. He has over-
all responsibility for the hiring of
faculty, for controlling the qual-
ity of instruction, and for devel-
oping the budget. Also as part of
his duties he will be contacting
prominent producers and direc-

tors to arrange auditions and in-
terviews for students of the
school.

The branch in Pasadena, which
only opened in October, will ab-
sorb much of Kahn's time spent
on Academy business. He was in-
volved in the final stages of ne-
gotiations prior to the opening
of the “West Coast Campus,”
and will devote a good deal of
time to getting it established on
a firm basis .

As an example of some of his
more pleasant duties, Kahn will
be travelling to California in
several weeks to attend a benefit
organized by Sammy Davis, Jr..

Kahn will be “commuting” to
New York and Pasadena fre-
quentiy on weekends. This tra-
vel will not conflict with any of
his drama classes here, since he
holds no Friday classes and will
normally return on Sunday even-
ings.

University Theatre productions
will still command top priority in
Kahn's schedule. He has made it
clear that he will not allow his
Academy functions to interefer
with preparations for W&L dra-
ma productions.

Kahn's appointment to this
post will have some effects on
this campus, however. The stu-
dents here “will be the recipients
of an awful lot of good things as
a result of my promotion,” says
Kahn. Continually in contact
with many of the great names in
American theatre. cinema, and
television, he will be presented
with numerous opportunities to
suggest to some of them to “drop
by Lexington for informal
workshops and presentations.
The added exposure W&L will
receive in the inner circles of the
dramatic world will certainly do
no harm.

The Academy is the nation’s
oldest professional drama-train-
ine school, having been founded
in 1884. and is the only institu-
lion in the nation devoted purely
to training in acting. Through an

Law, business,
and medicine
career choices

Law, business and medicine are
again the leading choices among
W&L freshmen when asked their
probable career plans.

The figure for lawyers is more
than four times the national
average among men at four-year
institutions. As it usually is, the
figure for future businessmen is
about the same as the national
men's norm; and, again follow-
ing the traditional pattern,
Washington and Lee's figure for
medicine is just about twice the
national men's average.

Politically, almost a quarter
of the freshmen class characteriz-
ed themselves as “liberal,” al-
most exactly the same as the na-
tional men's average at four-year
colleges. But almost 33 per cent
described themselves as ‘“con-
servative’ — more than twice
the nationwide average, 15 per
cent, among men in similar in-
stitutions.

Asked why they chose Wash-
ington and Lee, 85.9 per cent said
the university's “good academic
reputation” was a “very impor-
tant” reason. Nationally, 55.9 per
cent of male freshmen said they
had picked their college for that
reason.

Each fall, entering students at
W&L and at about 30 other four-
year colleges and universities
throughout the nation are asked
to indicate their career aims as
they see them at the moment.
The survey was conducted by the
American Council on Education
in cooperation with UCLA.

The telegram reached the FCC
just in time for the long Wash-

The Choice

We have reached that point in the school year when we are
asked to vote for the President of the student government. As
was the case last year, the coming elections are definitely not
the most exciting thing on the school calendar, At least we can
be thankful that we have alternatives in the election for
President of the Student Body.

Mr. McCullough faces Mike Luttig in the race for Presi-
dent. Both candidates are members of this year’s Executive
Committee, but we do not want to be completely negative.
Their experience should have given them some insight into
student government and the duties of the office they seek.

Nevertheless, we regret that the choice presented to the
students is not more clearly defined. Both gentlenmen are con-
scientious and will probably discharge their duties well, Un-
fortunately, both are very much alike in their perspectives on
student body issues. This is not to say that we disagree with
their views indicated elsewhere on this page, but we do wish
the contrast was more dramatic. Deciding which one to vote
for is something like trying to distinguish between blue violet
and violet blue in a box of Crayola Crayons.

There is, however, a subtle difference between the two
candidates. In the recent discussions by the EC on possible
changes to the honor system, Mr. Luttig often appeared the
more idealistic of the two. He frequently showed a tendency
to disregard, or at least overlook, the practical problems which
arise in administering the Honor System and to treat it as a
sacred cow. On the other hand, Mr. McCullough showed more
concern with making the Honor System grounded in reality.
His suggestions were practical, treating the Code as something
which had to be realistic and workable above all,

This difference in perspective is really all we have to go
on in deciding for whom we should vote. We are lucky that,
although our choice is limited, the candidates both appear
competent and willing to serve, Please keep in mind that the
administration of the Honor System is the most important
duty of the EC. Whether one wants to see the Honor System
treated practically or idealistically is the important factor.
Whatever, do take the time to vote in next Monday’s elections.

Letters to th

Macon girls complain;
disregard for Pines
creates unpleasantness

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

In response to an increase in
significant damages to both the
Pines houses and Smith Ban-
quet Hall as of January, 1975, we
feel it is necessary to specify to
all Randolph-Macon students
and their guests the rules and
responsibilities associated with
the use of these facilities.

During the month of January,
of which the college was in ses-
sion only two weeks, the total
cost of damage to the Pines was
$143.67. It is not the responsibil-
ity of the college to absorb these
costs, As stated in the R-M Stu-
dent Handbook under Student
Government Social Regulations,
Section B, 4c:

“... If any damage is report-

ed the girl who signed out

the key is subject to action
by the Dorm President's

Council and will be required

to pay for these damages.”

Unfortunately for the R-M
student, such damages are most
often the result of unruly be-
bavior on the part of their guests.
In some cases these guests (Le.
Fraternities) have assumed re-
sponsibility for the damages and
have paid the bill for the girl, It

Business Manager
DAVID R. LEE

....., Paul J. Lancaster

is hoped all such damages and
thus costs can be avoided in the
future.

Although the Pines houses are
in need of renovation to make
them more suitable for entertain-
ing, the Administration will not
provide the necessary funds un-
til a greater respect for the pro-
perty is exhibited by all students
and guests.

Recently, Smith Hall has also
been subject to damage during
social functions. Those of us who
sponsor activities hope to pre-
vent further destruction by sup-
port of the following:

1. Those persons displaying
behavior deemed unman-
ageable by the group
sponsoring the event will
not be admitted, and

2. Persons whose behavior
becomes unmanageable
during the course of the
event will be asked to
leave.

It is hoped the preceeding will
encourage all those concerned to
re-evaluate the responsibilities
involved in participation in any
and all social activities at Ran-
dolph-Macon in the future.

Respectfully,

(REVIEW and OUTLOOK] Student election set for Monday;

President: McCullough vs. Luttig

For President:
Leland McCullough

I believe your Student Body
President must actively seek out
problems and devise solutions.
The EC cannot afford to sit back
and wait for people to come to
it with problems; it is our duty
to be active. I have demonstrat-
ed that activity in my years of
service on the EC in many areas,
including:

HONOR SYSTEM—I formu-
lated the newly adopted adver-
sary system with an EC prose-
cutor and the tightened jury se-
lection procedures which ensure
an unbiased jury. I also suggest-
ed various other technical im-
provements.

BUDGET—I saved several hun-
dred dolars by convincing the
university to fund the Student
Recruitment Committee. I am
presently working with the Uni-
versity Treasurer to save another
$1,000. Next year I would like to
implement a system to allow stu-
dents to devote $5 of their stu-
dent body tax to any activity
they deem beneficial to W&L.

CURRICULUM — Two other
students and I have devised a
plan, now under consideration by
the faculty, to allow students
with a heavy load to take 9 cred-
its in a 12 week term.

ATHLETES—I have secured
the Athleic Department's un-
animous approval for P.E. courses
in outing activities, like camping,
hiking, canoeing, and hunting.

ALUMNI—I have been working
to improve student-alumni rela-
tions by having 1) a recent gra-
duate serve on the Alumni Board
of Directors, 2) a student report-
er for the Alumni magazine, and
3) students speak at alumni
gatherings and participate in
fund-raising trips.

TOWN-GOWN RELATIONS —
I am working with the Develop-
ment Office on a spring “open
house” to improve university-
community relations.

I firmly believe that I have
made significant efforts in a wide
range of areas to improve life at
W&L. Please keep these in mind.
I would appreciate your vote on
Monday.

Thank you,
Leland McCullough

Mike Luttig

The individual chosen as Stu-
dent Body President should pos-
sess a set of attributes which re-
sult in his being liked and im-
portantly, respected. Essential are
skills in conveying student con-
cerns in public and at admini-
strative meetings. And needed is
a well-organized person with a
seriousness which indicates an
awareness of the importance of
the position. He must be able and
willing to work long hours, yet
maintain with those he repre-

sents an association which will
encourage the exchange of opi-
nions. These leadership qualities
must not be dismissed when
choosing your President.

The suggesting of new legisla-
tion is vital in student govern-
ment. But, ideas are only bene-
ficial when coupled with an abil-
ity to effectively relate them to
other persons. Major changes or
modifications should be based on
reliable information. For this
reason the effects of honor sys-
tem changes and of coeducation
at other Universities must be
thoroughly examined to avoid
haphazard decisions should the
need for change arise. Equally
important is communication and
if elected I will establish regu-
lar meeting times with both the
student bar President and the
fraternity Presidents to improve
student input.

As Secretary, my accomplish-
ments are such that they do not
lend to detailed enumeration.
The daily corespondence of stu-
dent government, typing of min-
utes, organization of meetings
and the obligations incurred dur-
ing honor trials admittedly have
taken a large proportion of my
time. But, resulting from these
duties is a knowledge which can
be of great benefit in the office of
President. I offer for your con-
sideration both myself and the
jobs I have done as Secretary and
as an Executive Committee mem-
ber. Through these I hope it can
be understood the responsibility
with which I would perform the
duties of Student Body President.

Thank You,

Mike Luttig

Vice-President:
Mynders Glover

On Monday you will cast your
ballot for the candidates you feel
will best represent your views to
the Executive Committee and
work to achieve the goals which
will serve the Washington and
Lee community. I am a candidate
for Vice-President of the Stu-
dent Body, and I feel that I have
the necessary background and
qualifications to get the job done.

Primarily, the Vice-President is
responsible for devising and ad-
ministering the student budget,
as well as representing the E.C.
on the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee. In my three years at
Washington and Lee, I have serv-
ed as treasurer of my fraternity
where I became familiar with the
budgeting process, worked with
the Contact Committee, and am
presently an officer of the Com-
merce Fraternity. With this back-
ground, I feel I will be able to
meet the demands of the job and
also represent your ideas to the
faculty and E.C,

I will be more than happy to
answer any questions you may

Enforcement of rule
on children in Cockpit
found to be unfair

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi;

Not too long ago there appear-
ed an article in the Ring-tum Phi
concerning town children playing
inside the University Center
building.

The iti is House

It was stated that the children
were not allowed into the game
room or run around in the build-
ing.

I was in the Cockpit on the
29th of January about 8 p.m.
There were some children runn-
ing around and playing in both
the Cockpit and the game room.
These children just happened to
be friends of the cockpit man-
ager Marshall Sumner and his
son.
Is this policy only enforced for
town children with special per-
mission given to staff members?

If so this policy is very unfair.
It should be for all children re-
eardiess of who they are or where
they're from.

A rule should remain a rule.
Once it is made it should be en-
forced at all times.

Sincerely,
Jeanette Smith

have or listen to your suggestions

Mynders Glover
Candidate for Student Body
Vice-President

Ted Reeds

In the course of this statement
I wish to explain my intent for
pursuing this office and show
how my previous experience in
student government will help me
carry out the responsibilities of
the Vice-President.

My intent for seeking this of-
fice is that I want to serve the
school, rather than having the
school serve me. Whether it be in
intercollegiate sports or campus
politics, I feel that it is important
for a student to get involved.

The main duties of the Vice-
President are: 1) he is treasurer
of the EC; 2) he is technical ad-
visor to the accused in an Honor
Trial; 3) he is the student repre-
sentative on the Faculty E.C.;
and 4) he represents the EC on
the Publications Board.

To fulfill these duties requires
a certain amount of experience.
One cannot walk into a job like
that and hope to master it over-
night; there are too many re-
sponsibilities involved .

In the last two years I have
gained enough experience to
carry out these responsibilities. I
have served as a representative
on the IFC for the past two years,

and this year I have been a mem-
ber of both the University Coun-
cil and the Mock Convention
Committee.

In summary, I want to serve
this school and feel that I have
plenty of experience to do an
adequate job. Hopefully, you will
agree with me on next Monday.

Thank you,
Ted Reeds

Sandy Stradtman runs
for E.C. Secretary

Gentlemen:

The office of Secretary is a de-
manding job, as I have become
aware while serving on the EC
this year. Briefly, the secretary’s
regular time-consuming duties
are mainly concerned with cor-
respondence and keeping track of
the various campus organizations
and EC committees. I am willing
to accept these, along with the
incidental obligations of the of-
fice.

This year I have encountered
what I consider to be a weakness
of the Honor System, in that a

DEAR TRAVELLER—What is Washington and Lee doing to cope
with the continuing energy crisis’
(Signed) ex-Czar Simon

DEAR EX—Hats off to the Student Activities Board on this matter
for the most novel idea. The SAB. in the brunt of cold December
arctic air, took the initiative (and student body funds) to buy flowers
for all the administrative secretaries. The SAB move obviously saved
energy by warming the cockles of the secretaries’ hearts.

The University has been active in other areas in trying to save
energy. For instance, elevators in Reid Hall and Doremus are not
allowed to travel more than 55 miles per hour. And the C-school stu-
dents warm their library with their own naturally-produced methane
gas.
Also, Buildings and Grounds consistently collects garbage from
around the dorms at 7 a.m., eliminating the need for many student
alarm clocks.

A University spokesman told us that W&L will continue to strive
to save energy. Part of the University’s 10-year building improve-
ment plan includes re-wiring the campus heating system to benefit
from the largest source of hot air on campus — the EC and faculty
meeting rooms. That way, the University might finally benefit a
little from each. Of course, since faculty meetings are closed, the air
from that source will first have to be screened through the Univer-
sity’s Public Information Office.

The school is also planning to take after many Texas schools by
drilling oil wells along the Colonnade. “Of course, there's no oil,” says
= University spokesman, “but at least it will show the alumni we're

rying.”
DEAR TRAVELLER—I missed registration for the spring. What
should I sign up for?

 

(Signed ) Al Black
DEAR A.—The army, if you're dumb enough to miss registration.
Anyway, the University is holding open a few courses for late register-
ing, including:

—Journalism 098—Seminar in radio. Students will learn the basic
techniques of tuning in radio on their own receivers. Instruction
ranges from the transistor radio to the tougher task of figuring out
which button to push to give you stereo FM on your stereo system.
WLUR-F™M will provide lollipops to all those who can determine that
91.5 is not on the AM dial. C (M),

—Sociology 344—Communing with nature. Students will be re-
sponsible for hearing the language of trees, rocks, and Norm Lord in
this course. Students meet regularly along turkey trot or in Red
Square. Arranged. Professor E. Gibbons. Prerequisite: Math 256,

~— Comparative Literature( Art) 315—The literature of Poland.
Students must provide their own crayons.

~—Drama 317—Female impersonation. Required of all majors. Ex-
change students excluded. Final exam consists of showering at one of
the area girl's school (Southern Seminary not included).

Emmer optimistic about defensive Baseball opens season
lineup, foresees battle for goalie

(Ed. note: This is the second
of two articles by Phi Sports Edi-
tor Bill Flesher on the upcoming
Washington and Lee Lacrosse
season. This week Flesher talks
with Generals’ head coach Jack
Emmer about the team’s defense
and the schedule that lies
ahead.)

By BILL FLESHER
Phi Sports Editor

When we left our lacrosse pre-
view last week, we saw one la-
crosse coach who was more than
pleased with his attackmen but
worried as to what might happen
at the midfields, where gradua-
tion left several huge holes to be
filled.

But Jack Emmer remained en-
couraged that through experi-
ence the midfields would come
around in time, though how long
it would take was still a question.

So now we move toward the
W&L goal, and again we see
that graduation has taken a toll,
with two of the four spots vacant.

However Emmer can turn to
experienced players this time,
as four defensemen who saw con-
siderable action last year and the
number two goalie return from
the 1974.

And that’s mentioning nothing
of two of last year’s starters on
defense, which, according to
many experts, turned in one of
the greatest defensive efforts ever
by holding Johns’ Hopkins po-
tent attack to just two goals in
last year’s NCAA semi-final
game.

Junior-tri-captain Rob Lind-
sey, an honorable mention All-
American choice last year, and
sophomore Tom Keigler, who
may have deprived of post-sea-
sons honors due to his freshman
standing in 1974, return to form
what Emmer calls “maybe the

best one-two defensive combina-
tion anywhere.”

“Rob has a knack for rising
to the occasion and stopipng the
best attackmen on the oppos-
ing team, while Tommy may be
the best stick-handling defense-
man I've ever seen,” Emmer said
of his returnees on defense.

The third spot is up for grabs,
with four underclassmen joining
in the fight.

Sophomore John Strock, a
teammate of Keigler at Towson
High School, had the inside
track on the spot during the pre-
season, while junior Dave ‘“‘Weeb”’
Eubank and sophs Steve DiBia-
gio and Steve White were close
behind.

Emmer said that all will see a
lot of action this year if they play
like they have in practice.

So now we arrive at the six
foot square area called the goal,
which for three years has been
manned by one Sterling Chad-
wick, who made it a habit to stop
almost every shot opponents
tried to fire through that square.

But the best goalie in college
lacrosse las year has moved on,
leaving a hole no one had to
worry about until now.

And that, to a certain extent,
includes Emmer.

“We've got some potentially
good people to replace Skeeter,”
Emmer said, with a tone of hope
obviously coming through in his
voice,

A battle for the top spot in the
cage is on between junior Mal-
colm Hastings, Chadwick’s back-
up for the past two years, and
freshman Charlie Brown, a high
school All-American who brings
an excellent reputation to W&L.

As is the case at midfield, the
competition for the goalie spot is
strong, but Emmer sees it as
‘healthy.”

“Malcolm has the experience,
and might have an edge, but
Charlie does some things very
well, and we expect him to work
in there soon,” Emmer said of
his goalies.

So what about the season
ahead, a season that features a
schedule unmatched by any team
in the nation.

The Generals play 10 regular
season games plus three exhibi-
tion games with clubs teams from
Maryland which have several
W&L alumni on their rosters.

“The schedule looks a bit more
awesome than others because we

include our club games on ours,”
Emmer said. “But those club
games (with the Chesapeake, Mt.
Washington, and Maryland
clubs) don’t mean a thing, and
we'll approach them as if they
were intra-squad scrimmages.”

As for the regular season op-
ponents, Emmer capsulized his
outlook on some of the better
foes.

“The consensus around the la-
crosseo wrid is that most of the
teams are stronger this year,”
Emmer said, naming Generals’
opponents North Carolina,
Princeton, Bowling Green, and
Roanoke as some of the prime
examples of rumored improve-
ment.

“Naturally teams like Towson
State, Virginia, Navy, and Rut-
gers will be strong again, Em-
mer said, “but that’s not much
different from past years.”

As for the consensus opinion
on Washington and Lee?

“Well, I've been told that there
is no way that we can be as good
as last year without the people
that we lost,” said Emmer. “But
again, how can people know what
we are without even seeing us
this year.”

And so the stage is set to see
just what will happen without
the stars of yesterday, and to see
just whether or not the consen-
sus on W&L is at all accurate.

with a pair of games

against the U. of Conn.

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team opens its 1975 campaign
this weekend with a pair of
games against the University of
Connecticut.

The season opener at Smith
Field comes on Friday at 3 p.m.,
followed by a 2:00 game Satur-
day afternoon .

W&L head coach Joe Lyles
said that several of the starting
spots are still up in the air, and
probably would not be decided
until gametime on Friday.

“We're enthused over the pro-
spects for the season,” Lyles said,
noting that this year’s team “is
farther ahead of any team I’ve
ever coached.”

Generals ranked in second place
for opening round of tournament

N. C. Methodist and host
Washington and Lee University
have been seeded nos. 1 and 2 for
the NCAA championship basket-
ball tournament here this week-
end.

Methodist, with the best record
of the field at 20-4, will play Wil-
liam Paterson College of New
Jersey (19-5) in the opening
game of the Division III South
Atlantic Regional tourney. W&L
(15-10) will face another New
Jersey school, Glassboro State
(17-9), in the second game.

All games will be held in Dore-
mus Gymnasium, Friday and
Saturday, at 7 and 9 p.m. W&L’s
first round game with Glassboro
will be at 9 p.m. Friday. It is
Washington and Lee’s first ven-

ture into NCAA post-season
play in basketball.

The winner of the tournament
here will be host for the next
round of the championship play,
the quarterfinals, next Tuesday,
March 11. Should W&L win the
tournament on its home court,
the Generals would host the win-
ner of the Middle Atlantic Re-
gional in a single game. Four
Pennsylvania schools are com-
peting in the Middle Atlantic.
They are Scranton (19-7), Wide-
ner (18-7), Franklin & Marshall
(17-7) and Mansfield State (15-
9).

The winner of that contest
would then advance to the final
round of four teams which play
for the national championship

Generals to face West Virginia
in first tennis match on Saturday

A grueling 30-match schedule,
including some of the top teams
in the East and South, faces
Washington and Lee’s_ tennis
team as it opens its 1975 season
Saturday with a home match
against West Virginia.

The match will be played on
the new tennis courts behind Wil-
son Field at 1 p.m.

First-year head coach Dennis
Bussard, though still very involv-
ed with the NCAA-bound bas-
ketball Generals, had things to
say about the upcoming tennis
season.

“It has to be the toughest
schedule any W&L team has ever
had,” Bussard said, pointing out
that some of the opponents in-
clude Florida, South Florida,

Bussard said that he is look-
ing to four returning lettermen
to fill the top spots, while several
freshmen and players from last
year’s junior varsity team are
competing for the remaining
positions.

Senior captain John Embree,
who has won more than 70 per-
cent of his matches in his first
three years, leads the list of re-
turnees along with senior Buz
Walters, junior Don Caffrey, and
sophomore Jim Fisher.

Three freshmen, Ben Johns,
A. O. Smith, and Rex Nyquist
lead the list of newcomers, while
Jim Lawson and Dana LaForge
move up from the jayvees.

W&L’'s Hillside Terrace mar-
ried student apartments will be
vacated and torn down this sum-
mer, 29 years after the barracks-
like buildings were constructed
as “temporary” housing for
World War II veterans and their
families.

Eleven of the 18 married stu-
dents now living there graduate
in June, and the University is of-
fering the seven families who re-
main an opportunity to relocate
across town in the university's
other married student housing
area, Davidson Park.

Hillside Terrace was built in
1946 from government surplus
building units and as many as
48 student families lived in the
16 original structures. The re-
duction in the demand for mar-
ried student housing, originally
expected around 1950, did not
occur until 1960 when W&L be-
gan tearing down units as the
need decreased gradually.

The apartments stand on land
leased by the university from the
City of Lexington at a nominal
monthly fee. As W&L units have
been retired, other facilities have
been built on the site, including
offices of the Lexington-Rock-
bridge Health Department and

the area Mental Health Associa-
tion.

Many former tenants of Hill-
side Terrace are among now-pro-
minent alumni of Washington
and Lee, including the Univer-
sity’s President Robert E. R.
Huntley, who lived there two
years while in law school in the
mid-1950s.

The university said the apart-
ments are costing Washington
and Lee more in operations and
repairs than the university “in
good conscience” can charge its
student tenants. Although physi-
cally unattractive and inelegant,
the housing has always been a

popular bargain for student
families because of low rental
charges.

Hillside tenants returning to
school next year will be given
priority choice among vacant
apartments in Davidson Park.
Like Hillside, Davidson Park also
was built in 1946 from govern-
ment surplus, but its units are of
sturdier construction and in good
repair. Rents are modestly higher
than at Hillside, but still low in
comparison with living costs in
non-university housing. There
are no plans to phase out the 24
Davidson Park apartments now

He is attempting to gain experi-
ence in counselling as he hopes
to become a college counselor in

future years. His task is, as he

Hey sophomore: Did you know...

. U That taking the ROTC Two-Year program would bring
you about $3,000 and 8 elective credits between now and
graduation? ($500 plus travel, lodging, and food for each of two six
week camps, and $1,000 per school year.)

That you can beging the Two-Year program with the 6 week
Basic Camp (at Ft. Knox, Ky.—near Louisville ), this summer
and still have until classes start in September to evaluate your
decision prior to assuming any obligation.

That the ROTC program has the flexibility to accommodate
almost any schooling or career desire you might have, be it
graduate schooling (you can delay your entry on active duty
long enough to become, e.g. a doctor, if that is your desire )
or you non-scholarship students can opt for only three to
six months service, principally for schooling, after graduation?

That ROTC scholarships are available to ROTC students
for one, two, and three years and provide full tuition, text-
books, equipment, lab and matriculation fees plus $100 per
month (up to ten months of the school year) for the dura-
tion of the scholarship?

That the major difference between ROTC cadets and other
students is that ROTC cadets take classroom courses (in
civilian clothes) called military science and that they are
paid* $100 per month for their participaton?

(*Paid to students in the advanced course; current sophomores will

be enrolling for the advanced course in the Fall of '75,)

qualified to administer vocational
interests tests. He serves as a co-
leader with Ken Lane and Dr.
Worth in the recently initiated,
Friday afternoon human rela-
tions group. In addition, he will
assist Dr. Worth in teaching his
Developmental Psychology class.

He is the first W&L graduate
to come to Lexington for his
field-placement project. If his
work here is successful, as ap-
praised by Dr. Worth, it may be
possible to have other psychology

Procter & Gamble
Brand Management

It’s One of the Finest Career
Opportunities Available Anywhere

—Ghud Gow Lani Med tw MEAS

Procter & Gamble manufactures more than 50 consumer products,
including Crest toothpaste, Duncan Hines cake mixes, Tide detergent,
Pampers disposable diapers, Scope mouthwash and many others
whose names you would recognize just as easily.
For each product, there is a small group, usually just 3 people, who
plan, create, and supervise the total consumer marketing effort —
including TV advertising — for that brand. it's called Brand Manage-

ment, and it is one of the most challenging and personally rewarding
Jobs in our company.

Right now we're looking for a few highly qualified college seniors to
join us at the beginning level in brand management. “Innovative”,
“proven record of leadership and being able to get things done”,
“superior academic achievement”, and “good oral and written com-
munications skilis” are some of the words we use to describe the
people we want.

We want a “take charge” person who can assume immediate respon-
sibility, learn quickly, contribute good ideas, and cope with (and even
enjoy) constantly changing situations. To such a person we offer a
very bright future. We promote only from within, and only on merit,
