Freshman Initiates Faculty

Recently, a freshman, Bill Mill
key ,acting on his own accord, sent
a questionnaire to the faculty here
and letters to the administrations of
six other schools concerning the
necessity of restrictions prohibiting
cuts before and after holidays

The first question, “I support the
abolition of the present policy con-
cerning attendance before and after
could be answered either
yes, Mo, of no opinion. Eight ans-
wered 14 were opposed, and
three were undecided.

The second question, concerning
extending the cut policy
in effect to classes before and
vacations, was met with six in

In his corrspondence with other
schools, Millkey discovered that
Reed College had no rules concern-
ing cuts, and indeed stated that “any
system so restrictive would be view-
ed with a jaundiced eye by both
faculty and students here.” The Re-
gistrar of Swarthmore wrote that
“there was a growing feeling that it
(the cut rule) was inconsistent with
our basic approach: that of placing
responsibility on the student to do
his work and to satisfy his instruc
tors that he was doing so.”

Amherst has placed the deter-
mination of attendance policy on the
individual instructors, as does Wil-
liams College. Only one of the six
schools contacted did not reply. All
others had less restrictive policies.

This contrasts with W&L, where
only 32 faculty members responded
to Millkey’s independent survey. Of
those who did so, some wrote notes
such as “Confused and ambiguous.’
“What do vou mean?” and so
forth, and did not answer the ques-
lions.

Several brought out the idea of a

Proposed W&L Student

Exchange Programs Are

Approved By F aculty

Washington and Lee’s faculty has
endorsed the proposed cight-col-
lege student exchange program.

Action came at a faculty meet-
ing Monday. The proposal must
now go before a meeting of the
University’s Board of Trustees on
January | for final consideration
and action,

The colleges which would be in-
volved in the student exchange
would be Davidson, Hampden-Syd-
ney, Hollins, Mary Baldwin, Ran-
dolph - Macon, Randolph - Macon
Woman's College, Sweet Briar, and
Washington and Lee.

Basic principles approved by the
faculty for the program include:

|. The student exchange program
will be conducted for the mutual
benefit of the eight participating
colleges and their students, The
program is experimental in nature,
and is subject to review, modifica-
tion, or termination, should the ex-
perience of the first year prove all
or part of the program's features
undesirable or infeasible.

Survey

Millkey lamented the lack of re
sponse, and the fact that it pre
cluded getting a picture of faculty
sentiment which was more repre-
sentative. He added that the survey
might have been inadequate or am
biguous, but did not feel that it was
so unclear that more  profesosrs
might have responded in some fash
ion. He was further puzzled at the
number who did not consider worth-
while a re-examination of the cut
system

2. The program will involve a
limited number of students, with
each participating institution  ex-

pected to impose a limitation—to be
determined by the individual col-
leges—-as to the number of ex-
change students it will accept during
a given year. In addition to setting
an overall limitation on the number
of students it will accept, each col-
lege may impose specific limitations
on the number of exchange stu-
dents permissible in given courses or
departments.

3, Each institution agrees to ac-
cept work done by its students at
other colleges as if it has been per-
formed at the home college. Each
home institution will determine its
basis for recommending its students
as participants in the exchange pro-
gram: each host institution will ac-
cept without other evaluation such
students recommended by the home
institutions, subject, of course, to
the numerical limitations the host
schools may impose, either in re-
gard to total exchange numbers or
specific restrictions.

4. Participation in the exchange
program will be designed for stu-
dents in the junior year.

5. Exchange students will be ex-
pected to adhere to all appropriate
and applicable rules and regulations
of the host college, academic or
otherwise.

6. The host institution will deter-
mine in what ways it will accommo-
date the residence and dining re-
quirements of the exchange stu-
dents.

7. An equitable financial arrange-
ment will seek to assure that no in-
stitution must bear unacceptable fi-
nancial burdens by virtue of its par-

ticipation in the exchange program

The exchange, which would begin
with the 1970-71 academic year,
would include four women’s col-
leges and four men’s colleges.

Purposes of the program would
include: (1) to provide a more di-
verse Campus environment, (2) to
provide a limited initial experiment
in cooperative ventures among pri-
vately-supported colleges, possibly
leading to more extensive programs
in the future, (3) to broaden the edu-
cational opportunities of the stu
dents in the eight colleges.

Washington and Lee’s plans call
for accepting not more than 30 stu-
dents from other colleges in the first
year of the program. The exchange
students would come mainly from
the women's colleges. A similar
number of W&L students would be
permitted to go to the other colleges.

During February and March this
year, W&L President Robert Hunt
ley participated in a series of discus-
sions among presidents and othe
representatives of the area private
colleges regarding desirability and
feasibility of a student exchange pro-
gram. He then appointed a commit-
tee of faculty members, administra-
tors and students to evaluate the
proposal. In July, the presidents
and their staffs met again at Peaks
of Otter Lodge and from that three
day session came tentative mutual
agreement on guidelines for the pro
gram,

However, the necessity for ap
propriate consideration of the pro-
posal by W&L’s faculty and trustees,
and the approval of those two
groups, was understood among the
eight colleges to be a prerequisite to
Washington and Lee's participation

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

A Disappotnting Reponse

The results of an independent survey,
conducted by Bill Millkey and printed on
page one of this newspaper, are, to say the
least, disappointing.

Millkey distributed 108 questionnaires to
faculty members. He received only 32 re-
plies, and of those considerably less than
half seem to favor a less restrictive cut pol-
icy, specifically regarding classes before and
after vacations, which we feel students sup-
port almost unanimously. The response is
too small to be conclusive, but it may repre-
sent present sentiment.

Our disappointment arises from two
sources. First, the response was exceedingly
sparse. Admitting the probability that some
forms were lost or misplaced in collection
and distribution, many are still unaccounted
for. Millkey himself suggests that the ques-
tionnaire may not have been a clear one, and
may not have been considered because it had
the backing of no organization, but that is no
reason to ignore it.

Several professors seemed to fear Mill-
key was not presenting all the facts acquired
from correspondence with other schools, and
it is true that he doesn’t make clear that the
policies at Reed and Swarthmore are repre-
sentative of the replies he received, but we
hope no professor disregarded the survey
merely because its purpose was clearly to ef-
fect change. If that we thought was the case,
we would be even more disillusioned.

The second and more important cause
for our disappointment is the denial on the
part of many of those replying that changes
need to be made. There were, of course,
several reasonable objections raised to lessen-
ing restrictions on cuts in whatever area. The
major one seems to be that students in some
classes, specifically language and small par-
ticipation-oriented courses, suffer consider-
ably when attendance is not regular. This we
accept, but it is, we think, no reason to main-
tain a University-wide policy against cuts be-
fore and after vacation except for dean’s list
students. Indeed, by suggesting that in some
cases the present system is too liberal, it
argue against it.

Before we learned of Mr. Millkey’s poll
and its results, we wouldn’t have imagined
that an articulation of the argument against
the present restrictive system was necessary.
Apparently it is.

There is supposedly implicit in the idea
of a liberal education a great amount of re-
sponsibility placed on the student to govern
his time and his education both in the class-
room and out. Such a cut system as the pre-
sent one, especially insofar as it is stricter
than usual around holidays, is inconsistent
with the idea of individual responsibility.

We cannot moreover accept the argu-
ment that classes would be empty for the last
few days before and after vacations. We
doubt that dean’s list students consistently

Proposal Can

Jim Mathews and Reeve Kelsey have cul-
minated several years of unproductive com-
plaints about Interfraternity Council leader-
ship with their proposal to hold popular elec-
tions for the top two officers of that body.

As the proposal stands, the president and
vice-president will be elected by a majority of
voting fraternity members at the same time
that the Big Four elections are held. Runoffs
will also be handled at the same time as the
student body elections.

This proposal is the first serious move
in some years to correct a problem which has
been in existence even longer. That is, the
IFC leadership, because of the succession
system in the Judicial Board, is selected from
a very small number of present officers by
only the IFC itself. Thus there is little chance
for new ideas to emerge in the course of
campaigns, which can be conducted solely on
the basis of personal friendships and _politi-
cal bargaining. Further, the leadership, once
elected, has no sense of a legitimizing man-
date and is usually conditioned by a year's
service in a stultifying bureaucracy.

The result is that for some time the IFC
has been unable and unwilling to help fra-
ternities with the substantitive problems they
face and has rather been content to be an im-
pediment to progress of any kind. Its sole
function has been that of making token ges-
tures when faculty pressure on fraternities
becomes excessive.

No one pretends, of course, that the

take advantage of their privilege, and we
doubt that any other student would, either,
especially if the class were a stimulating one
and/or one in which the work could not be
effectively made up.

It is also the case that the present rule,
far from engendering a sense of common
effort the academic life should entail, tends
to divide the community even further into
the hill/ student dichotomy that already char-
acterizes it to too great a degree. Such a divi-
sion is likewise inconsistent with the idea of a
liberal education, particularly at a school like
W&L, whose size gives it the potential to
overcome such a split.

The catalog defends the present system
by saying that indication of responsibility is
required before the “privilege” of not going
to class is granted. We doubt first of all that
one’s degree of responsibility is measurable
in terms of gpr. Secondly, even if gpr is an
indication, we think a satisfactory record, as
opposed to an exceptional one, is evidence
of the responsibility required to allot one’s
time to his own best advantage.

And thirdly, we reject the whole notion
that the “privilege” of additional cuts be a
reward for academic proficiency. Scholarship
ought to be its own reward, and class attend-
ance is as much a privilege as the right to
stay away. This being the case, students’
rights should be more nearly equal than they
are at present.

Parenthetically, the idea of enforcing
this rule by the imposition of a fine is trans-
parently inappropriate, and in some cases an
unfair burden, even if one believes the rule
should stand.

So far, we have been arguing merely
against the present rule, with some founda-
tion in the educational philosophy W&L
espouses. We have yet to argue the positive
validity of a change in the rules on the same
grounds. The aforementioned advisibility of
letting the student decide for himself as far
as possible how he will spend his time is the
only major argument to advance, really, and
it, as the responses from five of the six
schools to which Mr. Millkey wrote (David-
son didn’t reply) indicate, is far from insigni-
ficant. Assuming, morever, that a relaxation
of rules would at the very least do no dam-
age, it would make life for students here a
lot more pleasant (allowing many to go home
or elsewhere over vacation that the time allot-
ed doesn’t presently permit) and a lot more
attractive to prospective students.

If indeed one can make a distinction be-
tween courses such a rule change would ef-
fect and those it wouldn’t, perhaps the best
solution is to allow each professor to set his
own attendance rules for each class he of fers.
In no case do we consider the present system
a viable one, and we hope that the faculty,
contrary to the disposition this inconclusive

survey seems to suggest, is amenable to al-
tering it.

Vitalize IFC

Mathews-Kelsey proposal will automatically
insure dynamic leadership. That is beyond
the power of any plan. It does, however, al-
low more possibility for it than presently
exists.

It will at least make likely the articula-
tion of some sort of program prior to elec-
tion, at once giving the voters an idea of what
they are voting for and the candidates some
goals for their administration. It will also of
course provide for a broader mandate and
reduce the oligarchical aspects inherent in
the present system.

The last advantage to be cited, that it
will make possible the introduction of leader-
ship from outside the IFC, might also be ad-
vanced as an objection. Finally, however, we
feel any gain in new ideas more than over-
comes the possible momentary disruption
the election of an officer unfamiliar with the
machinery might cause. If we may utilize an
analogy, we recall that last year’s student
body president had no previous experience
on the Executive Committee, but his term
was one of the most productive and progres-
sive in recent years.

Clearly, the plan needs to be discussed
further. All the details have not yet been
worked out, and there may be other ways to
attain the ends Mathews and Kelsey are
seeking. But those ends must be achieved,
and for that reasin we invite those who care to
comment, or to submit plans of their own, to
use this medium to do so.

The 1970's: Admissions Problems

(Editor’s Note: The following interview is the result of
a conversation earlier this week with James D, Farrar,
Director of Admissions. Chip Harris, Friday Managing
Editor, discussed with Dean Farrar current problems
facing the Admissions Department, and the Admissions
Department’s approach to these problems this year.
This interview compliments an earlier article on ad-
missions by Dick Capron.)

The Friday Ring-tum Phi: Could you give us an indica-
tion of the problems facing you this year?
Dean Farrar: | believe you are familiar with the ques-
tionnaire sent to young men last year who applied,
were accepted, but went elsewhere. A total of 770 ap-
plicants were offered admission for September 1969, Of
that group, 364 entered. Of the 406 not accepting our
offers of admission, 305 (75%) responded to our
questionnaire.

Geographic location ranked first, being checked by
47%, Co-educational preference was listed by 36%
and a preference toward a larger institution for other

-~ he

i ia ee

than academic reasons was a reason given by 25%.
An urban environment was prefered by 22% and prob-
lems of expense was checked by 16%.

For the 108 who responded and signed the ques-
tionnaire, enabling us to compare their files, SAT
board scores were 20 points higher for both verbal and
math scores.

R-t Phi: Could you expand on the problem of “geo-
graphical location” and any related factors?

Farrar: The problem is distance. We are semi-isolated,
the nearest air transportation being Roanoke. Con-
nected with this, and another large factor influencing
decisions, is the urban factor. Quite simply “that's
where the action is.”

We are in a period now where students prefer a
large university if not in an urban area, at least with
access to one.

R-t Phi: in light of these difficulties facing you what
is your approach this year?

Farrar: On the problems of recruiting, everything keys
on the ability to move. Two years ago we had two
people travelling, last year we had three, and this year
we have four, We have doubled our coverage in three
years.

Not only is the area an important factor but it is im-

portant that you go back the following year. You
have to establish a rapport with the schools, It's para-
mount that we maintain the size staff we have this year
R-t Phi: To what extent can alumni be of aid?
Farrar: We have four pilot alumni programs; in Chic-
ago, Philadelphia, The Tri-Cities area in North Caro-
lina, and Atlanta, This is a start. The people involved
in this program work in conjunction with us, imple-
menting our visits. As this develops we will have an
organization that will be able to make visits and answer
questions that applicants might have.

Our primary efforts are in visits and there is sim
ply no substitution for this; you can't do it by mail
R-t Phi: The issue of diversity has been an important
one in recent years could you elaborate on this?
Farrar: Geographical diversity means less and less to
day. The significant diversity is social and economic

When you start cutting across social and economic
lines, you must say to the schools: “we want talented,
able people regardless of their need.” We have been for
tunate that in the past five or six years we have been
able to help finance many men who otherwise would
not have been able to come. We have got to be able
to continue this in the future.

 

R-t Phi: Specifically, how about racial diversity?
Farrar: I recently spent three days in several 100%
black high schools in Philadelphia, and got the ques-
tion, “Why are you coming here?” The answer is fairly
obvious, | think that one of the greatest problems
facing us as a nation is the lack of understanding be-
tween the black and the white.

If we are ever going to understand each other, we
are going to have to study together and be educated
together. There isn’t this opportunity really now at
Washington and Lee for either the white or the black
man, so diversity, racially, is extremely important. I'm
giving you rationale that I think everybody recognizes.
This is what we have to let these people know,

Last year there were 10 young men invited to visit
the campus who were economically disadvantaged, often
with a social disadvantage built in. We offered all the
financial aid necessary to these ten; six were white and
four were black; the six whites came, the four blacks
didn't.

The problem with the blacks is obvious; We had
five black applicants, one confirmed. During the sum-
mer he informed us that he had been accepted by the
Naval Academy and went, because not only did it not
cost him anything but he got $175 a month. The com-
petition is extremely keen; these are very able young
men,

R-t Phi: Could you indicate your policy this year to-
ward black recruitment?

Farrar: This year with the increased staff and the or-
ganizational means open to us we have made an ex-
haustive effort; visits linked up with the programs we
are working with. Those programs include:

Project Access, an Educational Testing Service Pro-
gram which through the Preliminary Scholastic Apti-
tude Tesis and a brief questionnaire attempts to identify
underprivileged school students who demonstrate po-
tential for college. We have this information available
for hundreds of students in poverty area schools in
Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, and Dallas.

The National Scholarship Services and Fund for
Negro Students, 4 national program which identifies
black students with college potential in their junior
year in secondary school and acts primarily as a refer-
ral service to participating colleges. The University is
a participant in NSSFNS.

The National Achievement Scholarship Program, in
effect a black National Merit lesting Program. We
receive, at a charge, the names and addresses of com-
mended students, on the basis of their test results, and
we correspond with hundreds of students each year.

Opportunity Project for Education Now a program
in Washington, D.C. which identifies young men de-
monstrating college potential in the inner city schools
and arranges interviews between candidates and college
representatives at their offices,

The College Entrance Examination Board Test Fee
Waiver Program has been established by the Board and
Colleges wishing to participate and will help in identi-
fying economically disadvantaged students and waive
the expensive College Board Test fees.

These organizations are professional and we are
working closely with them.

_ The Executive Commitice’s Committee on Black
Enrollment can be extremely helpful, when it gets
organized.

R-t Phi: Any other recruiting programs you haven't
mentioned?

Farrar: We have been tuking advantage of college night
programs throughout the country, Professor Huntley
of the English Department spent four days in Rich-
mond,

You have to make a concerted effort, but you have
10 also make a specific effort. We have been through-
out the Middle Wesi, Texas: ete.

A lot of the problem we have been facing is a

matter of pure numbers; trends in the population, In
the past few years applications were generally down,
where last year they began going up. You have dips
and bounds, and when your pool of applicants drop
everything else drops. é
R-t Phi: Could you return to your approaches to the
problems brought out in the questionnaire: do you or
are you planning any long range programs to combat
their effect?
Farrar: We can't do anything
for that matier the urban problem, or size. No matter
what our committee studying it Presently comes up
with, size will never, it seems to me, increase to up-
wards of 5,000 or 10,000 that we are talking about in
a “large” university; we simply don't have the space.

The problem of co-education | think is not over-

Speaking My Mind

Well It’s a Start Anyway

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

It kind of crept up on us, but
there’s no doubt about it, winter is
here. The signs of it are everywhere.
Cold winds are whistling in from
the Alleghenies, snow flurries occa-
sionally sweep down the Shenan-
doah Valley, the countdown to
Christmas has started, and of course
Davidson has a nationally ranked
basketball team. So what else is
new?

You say how much difference can
there be between two small mens’
schools both of which are nestled
away in ancient Southern towns?
Both of them are known to be fine
academic institutions, but one has a
much wider reputation than the
other because it gets free advertis-
ing in every sports page in the coun-
try. The one is Davidson, the other
is, unfortunately, Washingion and
Lee. Nobody's forgetting that David-
son exists, where on the other hand
_, . but let’s not go into that.

Number 6, That's where Sports
Illustrated rates Davidson this year.
Sporting News rates it as number

four. Oh, and by the way, the
Davidson football team is going to a
bowl game this year. The Tangerine
Bowl. Pasadena it’s not, but even
the Tangerine Bowl is pretty good
for a small mens’ school of 1,000.

So, where did it all start? Can we
follow the Davidson example. . .
should we care to?

Well, we've taken one step in that
direction. Have you taken a look at
the basketball schedule this year?
Not bad. We might lose a few more
ball games, but we'll get into more
sports pages. Navy is on the agenda
again, and, if you check the sched-
ule you'll find Lehigh, Rollins,
Baltimore U., Dickinson, Wofford,
and Fairleigh Dickinson, It's not
worth a standing ovation... that is
unless you remember the big Eas-
tern Mennonite, King College, UNC
at who-knows-where line-up of three
years ago. Boy, those were the days.
We rolled up big scores, yeh, but
what did it matter? Nothing! Right?
... Wrong!

You have to believe that Coach
Canfield, and the rest of the staff,
for that matter, wanted to play
name schools. But what are you g0-
ing to do with a miserable team?
rhis was the situation that Canfield
faced when he took over. So he be-
gan to recruit, an art that had ap-
parently been disappearing around
here.

He actually didn't have to olok
very far for his talent, though. Find-
ing his quick-handed guard (Nor-
wood Morrison) and his strong, re-
bounding forward (Stu Fauber) in
Lynchburg playing at the same
school, Canfield then turned to Mar-
tinsville and Mel Cartwright for his
scoring punch. Big Mike Neer
dropped in from Brown a year later
to give the team its much-needed
big man, Not without altering the
schedule too much, the Generals
could have good, even excellent sea-
sons. Against so-so teams the Gen-
erals proved to everyone but most
importantly to themselves that they

Washington and Lee’s basketball team evened its 1969-

Generals Get First Victory

70 record at 1-1 with a resounding 102-87 victory over Bridge-

water Wednesday night.

Mike Daniel led the scoring barrage with 28 points and
added seven rebounds. Stuart Fauber and Mike Neer con-
tributed 12 and 10 points respectively.

“It was almost a run and shoot
game, which we don’t like,” ex-
plained head coach Verne Canfield,
“We put very littke pressure on
them in the first half, but the second
half was much better.”

Leading only 50-47 at halftime,
the Generals pulled away in the
third quarter. W&L after a first half
performance of 2 rebounds and a
50% field goal percentage, finished
the game with 47 rebounds and a
54% floor percentage.

Cook and Wampler led the Eagles
in Bridgewater's point production.
Cook scored 25 and Wampler tossed
in 18 with eight rebounds.

The Generals outmanned the
Eagles in rebounds, as Bridgewater
could only collect 40. A floor per-
centage of only 43% also crippled
Bridgewater.

Another factor which pleased
Coach Canfield was the Generals’
conditioning. “We had depth, too.
That will be an asset further into the
season,” he added.

Referring to the season-opening
loss to Randolph-Macon, Coach
Canfield attributed the defeat to
“mental turnovers”. “Defensively, it
was one of our best efforts. The kids
might have been too ready.” Coach
Canfield thought that the 57-56 loss
was not the result of big problems
While praising Scott Wood's defen-
sive effort, the head coach expressed
some displeasure with the back-
court.

Against the Yellow Jackets, Mike
Neer put in 17 points and grabbed
17 rebounds. Norwood Morrison
added 12. Weston tossed in 24
points with 15 rebounds for the
Jackets, followed by Howard (10
points, five rebounds). Both teams
were cold on the floor, Randolph-
Macon hitting 32° of the time and
Washington and Lee for 43%. The
Generals just edged the Jackets in
the rebound department, 41-40.

Tomorrow night the Generals
open their home season with a po-
tent Rollins team. Head Coach Boyd
Coffie welcomed eight returning let-
termen, including all five starters.
The Winter Park, Florida school
boasted a 16-10 record last year

The nucleus of the team is com-
posed of Laurence Martinez, Frank
Valenti, and Tim Shea. Martinez, a
61" junior, averaged 21 points a
game last year and set a new Rollins
individual scoring mark with 538
points. Valenti, the Tars’ play-
maker, is a New York City product
who averaged 15 points each game

Sophomore Tim Shea led the team
in rebounding and contributed 12
points.

The other members of the Tars’
starting roundballers are 64° Jim
Murphey and 6'7” Cliff Livingston,
an Edison Junior College transfer.

Rolins opened its season last Mon-
day with Stetson University, ranked
eleventh in Basketball News Maga-
zine’s small college poll. Stetson
edged the Tars in overtime, 77-76,
with Martinez scoring 23 points and
Shea adding 12.

“So we'll have our hands full,”
opinioned Coach Canfield.

University of Virginia Presents
Joplin Performance Tomorrow

The University of Virginia Uni-
versity Union will sponsor Janis

Joplin in concert tomorrow night in
Charlottesville. Tickets for the con-
cert, scheduled for Virginia’s Uni-
versity Hall at 7:30, will be $3.50 at
the door,

One of the dominant figures in to-
day’s rock field, Miss Joplin, who
rose to fame with Big Brother and
the Holding Company, draws widely
varying reactions from those who
see and hear her,

William Glackin of the Sacra-
mento Bee termed her an “extra-
ordinarily compelling performer”

and attributed her success in part to
a “restless energy that moves her
back and forth, up and down, all
the time.”

The New York Times said that “if
Janis had happened in another era
she would have been known as one
of the great jazz singers,” while
Lloyd Dykk of the Vancouver Sun
termed her “a lamb offering itself to
the gods, a physical dissipation and
a spiritual elevation with a voice
reminiscent of a buzz-saw.”

Brian McLeod of The Province
reported that “Janis Joplin defies
categories, gender and description.
She can twist her dynamic blues
voices around any form she desires.
Huskiness becomes her as it seems
to become all chanteuses in her
vein, but under the flaunted tough
shell there is more than a trace of
angelic delicacy and the soprano.”

Elsewhere on the concert scene at
neighboring schools, the Student Ac-
tivities Committee of Madison Col-
lege will present a Christmas Con-
cert in Harrisonburg on Friday, De-
cember 12.

The Swinging Medallions, whose
hits include “Double Shot,” and Bob
Marshall and the Chrystals, known
for “She Shot a Hole in My Soul”
will be featured in the concert
which will be held in Wilson Audi-
torium.

There will be two shows, at 7
p.m. and 10 p.m. Tickets, either by
the advance sale that started Decem-
ber 1, or at the door, are two dol-
lars per person,

cerned alumni. Invariably, however,
they were concerned with one topic:
dress.

When alumni come to Lexington
to confer with the administration,
their major complaint concerns that
same topic: dress.

] ask you, Charles Gilmore: Have
you attempted to determine why
Washington and Lee does not have
a reputation as the finest school of
its kind, as it could and should?

Have you attempted to determine
why some of the facilities at Wash-
ington and Lee are over-crowded or
insufficient?

Have you questioned the essenti-
ally homogeneous makeup of the
student body? Have you attempted
to determine why minority groups
avoid Washington and Lee?

No, Charles Gilmore, you limit
your probing to a minor outward
manifestation, i.c., dress. And you
do so with diction which would at
best be considered substandard.

If you will excuse the use of an
unfortunate yet unavoidable cliche,
the “silent majority” of alumni must
be concerned with issues more sub-
stantial than those with which Gil-
more and Friends concern them-
selves,

In any event, | am so concerned,
and will continue to make my con-
cern known in the future. | urge
others to do likewise.

Red Cross Blood mobile
Arrives Here Wednesday

The American Red Cross Blood-
mobile will be at the University
Center this coming Wednesday
from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. The Uni-
versity is expecting a good turnout
from its students because over 300
signed pledges promising to give
blood. Permission has been ob-
tained from the great majority of
parents of the students under 21
who have promised to give blood.
hese slips have been filed wiih the
Red Cross.

The Red Cross has always been
short of donations during the Christ-
mas season in the past. Holiday sea-
son accidents increase the demand
while colds and the flu cut down on
the usable blood supply. For this
reason the Rockbridge area has al-
ways been dependant on the WAL
students for a large turnout.

The turnout of WAL students in
the past has been rather poor. For
a long period the Bloodmobile didn't
bother to come. However, last year
indicated a great improvement as
88 pints of blood were donated by
students. This “record” looks medio-
cre when last year students at Hol-
lins donated 149 pints and Long-
wood students donated 169 pints.
