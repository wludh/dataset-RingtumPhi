THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Thieves chagrin

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday, September 30, 1969

Some reflections of our own

We read with much interest the thoughts expressed by
Mr. C. Turner in his letter to the editor published in The
Friday Ring-tum Phi. It cannot be intelligently refuted that
the five questions he raises are important to the Washington
and Lee community. While we do not necessarily agree with
some of his implications pertaining to these issues, we must
concur, as Mr. Turner pointed out, that there are “no neat
universal answers.” Yet surely feasible solutions must exist.
We do in fact consider it part of our task this year to aid the
process of learning what the most workable answers to these
problems are. We cannot provide those answers.

Keeping this purpose in mind, we were delighted that we
were able with our first issue of the year to generate some
response from at least one member of the student body. For,
as we stated last week, we welcome and encourage your criti-
cism or support. However, we were alarmed at Mr. Turner’s
charge of “complacent or negligent insensitivity in the social
and academic aspects of W&L” on the part of the Tuesday
edition. Does Mr. Turner really expect the small handful of
students, who are also part-time newspapermen, that consti-
tutes the Tuesday staff to be one-hundred percent “‘aware’”’ of
every single issue that confronts every single student in the
University? We would indeed be flattered if we could
measure up to this expectation, but unfortunately we are only
human.

We can, however, lament the fact that there are not more
C. Turners in this school—that is, more students who are
willing to sacrifice a few precious hours of prime T.V. time to
contribute to the paper. Only with this condition can The
Ring-tum Phi rise above mediocrity and develop into what it
ideally should be and do what it ideally should do.

Granted we may not see eyeball-to-eyeball with Mr.
Turner on all of his observations. And we cannot see eyeball-
to-eyeball with every student, not even on something as simple
as the definition of issues. Still, the fact remains we cannot
intuitively know what you are thinking. “We will endeavor
to bring to light student opinion on all issues and from all
angles.” Nifty? Yes, it is. But student opinion is not a tangible
item that we can concoct in the newspaper office on a Monday
night. Our capabilities extend only to reporting the facts and
to offering our own opinions—it is up to you to let us know
what yours are.

Therefore we encourage you to think about and invite
you to write about the questions posed by Mr. Turner, as
well as any other issues that may exist. Is conventional dress
relevant to the academic community? Is it important to be
clean and neat? Do the seletcion methods of members for the
standing committees of the student body need to be improv-
ed? Are selections really handled along social fraternity lines?
Has the Assimilation Committee outlived its usefulness? Why
were work weeks initiated for pledges? How far should social
clubs or fraternities go in participating in community affairs?
Should there be ion rush? September rush? no rush?
Was last year’s valedictory address valid? Co-education at
W&L? And so on and so on. ...

We confidently suspect that no student is immune to all
of these problems. Can you expect the faculty, or the EC, or
the IFC, or even the Ring-tum Phis to alone arrive at adequate
solutions to these problems? We cannot put any of these ve-
hicles in motion unless you first turn on the ignition.

A widening of horizons

Hats off to the Executive Committee . . . particularly to
Messrs. Bethea, Dobbins, Baker, Azuma and Henberg, who
voted last night in favor of accepting the resolution printed
on page one of this issue.

There are several important implications regarding this
resolution that must not be overlooked. Not the least of these
is the point raised by Mr. Staman Ogilvie, that certain stu-
dents may use this as a pretense for cutting classes and that
would be as far as their involvement would go. We hope that
no one takes such undesirable liberty. Fortunately, the resolu-
tion does not direct students toward a specific action such as
not attending class. It calls for seletive, individual appraisal
of the situation in Vietnam. We hope that the student body
justifies the confidence the EC has placed in them, and decide
for themselves on a rational basis whether or not to partici-
pate in the moratorium.

Perhaps even a more significant implication contained in
the text of the resolution is the precedent of widening the
horizons of the Executive Committee to an area of concern
previously regarded as taboo.

“Whereas conscious that its role need not be limited
strictly to affairs on our own campus but must sometimes
include the concerns of university students everywhere,
the Executive Committee feels it is important for indivi-
dual students, whatever their opinion, to examine periodi-
cally our country’s involvement in the war.”

It is all too easy to become bogged down in daily life and
let that war going on somewhere across the globe slip to the
backs of our minds. But the war is being fought, and there is
not a student here that is not affected by it in some way. We
might even suggest that the war is something more real to
most students than, say, the Cold Check Committee. Yet, in
the past the war has been largely relegated on a formal basis
to the status of that-which-may-come-up in class. It is very
encouraging to see that the EC has taken a step to emphasize
the closeness of this national problem to our campus.

at only squeaks
at gates of hell

By David Higgins
Columnist
Last year I was warned that “the

gates of hell will open first in Lex- }

ington, Virginia.” The man who told

me this was obviously dramatizing |
the faults of our little sin city, but ,
it is quite true that certain unsanc- '
tioned activities, including thievery, ,
do occur here. Two areas of this }

permanent form of borrowing affect
the Washington and Lee community
directly, and are more extensive
than we perhaps imagine.

One area of indiscriminate prac-
tices is the sale of used furniture.

Some of these businessmen enjoy |

the profits of selling the W&L stu-
dent his own property. One second-
hand shop which I visited last year
was selling, at quite
prices, chairs with our school mono-
gram sprayed on the back. In ad-
dition a foot locker with the name
and address of a student on it was
for sale, again at a very reasonable
price. The student in question had
“lost” it some months before.

Due to obvious bookkeeping prob-
lems, these establishments usually
keep their doors open for only a
few months, these being quite logi-
cally the first ones of the school
year. When questioned the proprie-
tors claim at having found the ar-
ticles discarded . . . or unguarded.

A second area of profit for these
gentlemen is the fraternity house
and its parking lot. The criminals
here are usually young boys who
with a little nerve and some dark
socks manage to gain browsing
rights at most houses. There is a
guideline which they follow, and
this is that houses containing un-
rowdy members are usually the
easiest to survey at will. Consequent-
ly some houses are victimized more
than others. For the most part the
thievery is of minimal importance,
but occasionally a coup of criminal
excellence does occur, as when a
color TV was procured in tact.

Consequently the thief to us is
really only a pesky nuisance and of
no permanent affect, thanks largely
to Bob Murray. If the thieving ele-
ment were to use a little more
imagination and planning, I can
think of many ways that they might
well increase their turnover. Until
then, however, | am afraid that,
much to my friend’s chagrin, the
gates of hell are merely faintly
squeaking around us, and that we
are really not going to be the second
Sodom.

Whitehurst talk

By Cy Dillon

Monday evening second district
Congressman G. William Whitehurst

dents on recent action in the House

Spence calls for forums

in classes on 15 October

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Gentlemen, as we look around us
certainly we can perceive that we
are in the age of public action. Ap-
proximately one week ago there ap-
peared an advertisement tacked up
on the bulletin board in front of
Payne Hall. The advertisement was
extracted from the previous Sunday
New York Times, and it advocated
a national strike by college students
and professors on the fifteenth of
October {to protest American in-
volvement in Viet-Nam.

Students and professors across the
nation have reacted to this in a
variety of ways. There are those
who want a strike that will boycott
classes that day and others who
would desire to take over their par-
ticular institution to make it an

 

anti-war headquarters, However
many have answered this call in an
alternative and more responsible

fashion. The alternative is to have
Teach-Ins on their respective camp-
uses, One such school in our area
that will have some form of a
feach-In is Hollins College.

There are many students here at
Washington and Lee that are con-
sidering a class boycott or similar
action in sympathy with the move
ment. It is questionable in this ob-
server's mind as to whether we

Lee’s facebook machine
to enhance the bookstore

As every new year begins, there
goes with it a frantic search for face-
books from the girls’ schools. It was
this mad scramble three years ago
that prompted Bob Lee, a Sigma
Chi senior, to do something about
it.

Lee has devised a machine which
contains facebooks from the most
heavily dated girls’ schools—Mary
Baldwin, Sweetbriar, Randolph-
Macon, and Hollins. The machine
is nearing completion and will be
placed in the Bookstore in the co-
op Wednesday or Thursday of this
week, Lee has been working on it
for a year or so and his project has
been kept classified.

The machine works on much the
same principle as the record selec-
tion part of a juke box. The box
contains an electronically timed light
and upon inserting a quatrer in the
machine, the viewer finds all four
facebooks at his disposal, and he is
able to flip through them for two
minutes.

Much of the holdup in the com-
pletion of the machine was due to
lack of parts, The electronic timing
device took some time to get; it was
finally obtained from a chemical
plant. The machine would have
been ready sooner this year, but it
had to be cut down to fit in the
available space in the Bookstore.

Hillard strikes a blow
for peace demonstration

Foes of the Vietnam war are
planning to tell President Nixon on
Oct. 15 that it is time to bring the
boys home. A nationwide campaign
of anti-war demonstrators is being
planned, with the major thrust ex-
pected to come from college camp-
uses throughout the country.

Nixon has said that he will not be
affected in the least by the demon-
straions—but he cannot mean it.
The President of the United States
must take note of public opinion.

Just how effective the demonstra-
tions are will depend on three fac-
tors: how widespread the partici-
pation is, how much coverage it gets
from the news media, and how well
organized the rallies are.

The first two questions can be an-
swered at this time, a fortnight be-
fore the event.

Anti-war demonstrations will be
present on almost every campus in
the nation, At least one million stu-
dents will protest American involve-
ment in the war. The Vietnam con-
flict is the most unpopular, tragic

would gain anything from an empty
or half-empty school. I think not.
However, I do believe we could all
learn a great deal from each other
and our professors if we were to
hold a Teach-In on the fifteenth of
October.

The War is pressing in on all of
us here at WAL becatse as it goes
on we will continue to supply our
graduating seniors to fight in the
war, Whether one believes the war
right or wrong it is obvious to all
that we are going to lose many of
the future leaders of this country as
long as H continues.

In a close community such as
there is at WAL we have a greater
opportunity to reach each other
concerning the pressing issues that
confront us, However, this oppor
tunity is wasted if we do not put it

1 think we have an opporiunity
fo get a wealth of fact and opinion
from each other and the faculty if
we have a school-wide teach-in on
October 15. Therefore | would like
to request all faculty members to
cancel their lecture or test for the
fifteenth of October and have each
class become an open forum through
which we might all learn together
concerning this most pressing issue
of the war in Viel-Nam. | hope that
as a result of such a day that we
may all be able to heip and enrich

and utterly ridiculous episode in
United States history. Casulty fig-
ures continue to mount. The Paris
Peace Talks drag on, making abso-
lutely no progress. And most tra-
gically, the war is no nearer a mili-
tary conclusion than it was four
years ago when President Johnson
decided to escalate.

Americans are becoming more and
more unanimous in their opinion
that an “honorable settlement,” the
goal of the present administration,
cannot and will not ever be reached,
and only by a complete unilateral
withdrawal will the United States be
able to free itself from the conflict.

Nowhere is this belief stronger
than among the nation’s college stu-
dents. They will let their voices be
heard Oct. 15,

The news media will give the de-
monstrators big play—undoubtedly
the day's lead story unless some
Senator happens to crash his private
airplane into the Grand Canyon
while on a fun outing with some un-
married girl,

When millions of Americans sit
down in the evening to watch Walter
Cronkite or Huntley and Brinkley,
they will view filmed reports from
campuses throughout the country.
And the T.V, will definitely be on in
the White House.

But how the students conduct their
demonstrations will be all important.
Peaceful demonstration is a corner-
sione of democracy, But a society
concerned with law and order will
not tolerate anything less than a
peaceful demonstration.

Whether student leaders care to
admit it, the reason for the demon-
strations ts to influence The Estab.
lishment, A million students orderly
voicing their unanimous protest to a
cruel war will have a ereat effect
on The Establishment. But a million

Staff editorial

Take a stand

It seems that today Washington
and Lee is in the midst of a period
of change and subtle upheaval. The
reference here is specifically aimed
at the fraternity system. There are
forces on this campus that would
cheerfully see fraternities wither and
disappear. These forces, incident-
ally, are not just composed of non-
fraternity men. It is not believable
that all non-fraternity men would
gleefully see fraternities die at WAL.

The fraternities are, to a certain
degree, united by the IFC. How-
ever, there seems to be a great de-
gree of hypocrisy in the actions of
this body. This judgment is based
on past years in hopes of a change
in the future,

This body for several years has
had rules passed to make pledging
at W&L look mild, extremely civiliz-
ed and humane. This editorial is not
written to take a stand on the way
pledging should be conducted but to
point out the incongruity in a sys-
tem where members of each fra-
ternity get together to vote to out-
law any form of hazing (any physi-
cal or mental discomfort or danger),
set up stiff fines for violations, and
then promptly go back to their
houses and violate these rules —
sometimes in blatant openness.

The conclusion can only be that
these rules and regulations are pass-
ed and approved only to appease
an often anti-fraternity administra-
tion. This course of action seems
terribly hypocritical and certainly
unbecoming a gentleman (which we
pride ourselves to be). The com-
ments in this editorial seem obvious
but it seems that every student
should think about this subject,
make a decision and decide to stick
by it whether at an IFC meeting or
a House meeting.

Officially hazing has been long
abandoned and yet in reality it exists
in almost every house on campus.
Admittedly hazing is not what it
used to be but that is not the sub-
ject at hand. The point is that a
man of strong moral fiber should
make a decision and then in sticking
by it follow a consistent line of
action regardless of his surround-
ings. Any other line of action seems
to be cowardly and untrue.

If the past is repeated in years to
come regarding this subject it will
hasten the demise of fraternities at
this institution. The path of hazing
cannot be followed and the sooner
this is realized the better it will be
for everyone. The rules that the IPC
has set up to regulate pledging are
excellent—it is up to the general
body of fraternity men to uphold
them and the IFC to enforce them.

a book which is autographed by a
well-known poet containing a revi-
sion of an earlier poem in his own
writing.

The McCormick Library's copy of
Robert Frost's West Brook,
donated to the library by John M.
Glenn, bears the inscription “For
Mary Wilcox Glenn from Robert
Frost.” Contained on page fifty-five
of the book in a revised form is the
poem “The Egg and the Machine,”
which first appeared in The Second
American Caravan, published in
early 1928. The poem appeared in
the 1930 Collected Poems in the re-
vised form and under the title “The
Walker.”

Dr. Sargent Bush, on leave this
year from the English Department,
has been researching the value of
the inscribed poem. Dr. Bush has
been in contact with the librarian at
Amherst College, one of the colleges
with an outstanding collection of
Frosiania, From Amberst he found
that it was not unusual for Frost to
inscribe the first few lines of a poem
on a blank page in one of the books
he gave to friends, such as he did
in Mrs. Glenn's copy. However, the

Thunder’s Theories

On a Sunday afternoon

By Thunder Thornton
Sports Columnist

Sunday afternoons are fast becom-
ing to football aficianados what a
Cecil B. DeMille movie spectacular
used to be to theatre nuts. From the
pleasant surroundings of your fra-

Jayvee football set back

Washington and Lee’s jayvee foot-
ball team lost to Massanutten Mili-
tary Academy, 44-0, on September
26, and the cliche, “chalk it up to
experience”, was not too shop worn
to be used here. W&L was simply
outmanned and outplayed. The
game was a learning experience, and
so it was with dry eyes that Coach
Poudrier commented about the jay-
vees and their opening game.

“W&L played good football. The
boys learned their fundamentals, and
it was a good game to iron out mis-
takes. They gained experience as a
team and at the college level.”

Without making excuses, Poud-
rier observed that Massanutten is
the equivalent of a junior college,
and that many of its players have
played college ball previously. The
big thing for W&L, Poudrier felt,
was that instead of continuous, non-
competitive practice sessions which
could become dull, the jayvees got
some football experience under
game conditions. The experience
and further practice, noted Poud-
rier, will make a victory a more
plausible goal in the jayvees’ next
game with Augusta Academy on
October 24.

W&L wins

soccer match

Washington and Lee posted a
victory in its first outing of the
soccer campaign, Coach Joe Lyles’
team had to overcome the disadvan-
tages of a visiting team and a last
period deficit to take Pfeiffer College
with a 4-2 score.

Pfeiffer jumped ahead 1-0 in the
first quarter, but the Generals evened
things up at a goal apiece. Going
into the fourth period Pfeiffer once
again held the lead 2-1. Suddenly
momentum, that indefinable force,
swung W&L’s way as three scores
went up on the scoreboard. ‘Two of
Washington and Lee’s tallies can be
credited to super sophomore Don
Belt, with the other goals being con-
tributed by Meade Kampfmueller

Whitehurst talk

covers weighty
national topics

(Continued from Page 2)
students at Old Dominion College
in Norfolk. Elected to the House in
1968. he is a junior member of the
influential Armed Services Commit-
tee. =

The speech had been publicized

as being on the possibility of a vol-
unteer army, but Rep, Whitehurst
felt that “you cannot speak fifteen
or twenty minutes on that.” How-
ever, he did express mixed feelings
on the subject of the draft, and
stated his own support for a lottery
system.
“According to Rep. Whitehurst
there is a change in the draft law
on the way, but a volunteer army
is opposed for two reasons—first,
today’s draftees are excellent sol-
diers; second, many military and
civilian leaders fear the narrowness
of a professional army.

The only hint Rep. Whitehurst

would give us as college students for
the future was that the situation
looked bright for those past nine-
teen. Don’t drop out of ROTC yet,
though; the nature of the change is
still completely in doubt.

Rep. Whitehurst went on to ex-
plain the recently proposed changes
in the method of electing the presi-
dent, and gave an account of the
House’s passage of this bill. He then
expressed support for the  Presi-
dent’s foreign policy, and for the
administration in general. Rep.
Whitehurst feels that President
Nixon has “not deviated from his
goals” in dealing with the world
situation, The Congressman holds
that Mr, Nixon will get the U.S. out
of Viet Nam, and preserve the
honor and prestige of the country in
the treaty creditability—but, it will
take a good deal of time.

As Representative for the second
district in Virginia, which includes
large Navy and_ ship-building  in-
stallations, Mr. Whitehurst favors
maintaining a strong merchant fleet
as well as a substantial military sea
power. He gave insights to the
state of our surface Navy and sup-
ported the development of more
nuclear striking power.

The atomic capability of the
USSR was vividly portrayed by Rep.
Whitehurst. He stressed the need
for continual research and develop-
ment on the part of the United
States in conventional as well as
atomic Weaponry.

The most striking point of his
series of remarks was that nothing
can guarantee peace for our nation
but military superiority, One must
be a realist, Mr. Whitehurst con-
tends, “It’s not a matter of being a
hawk or a dove, but—my God—a
matter of defending the country.”

several times, The defense could not
keep Stevens, who showed as much
lateral as forward speed, from carry-
ing the ball 26 times for 168 yards.
At the half, the Generals were down
22-0.

In the second half, Jack Baizley
came in to spur the Generals of-
fense to life. Twice the Generals
were able to score and add the two
point conversion. The Macon de-
fense toughened, however, and the
Generals found points and valuable
time hard to come by.

The Macon loss, like any loss,
was hard to swallow but like any
other sting, the swelling soon goes
down and you look ahead to avoid
being stung again. This week's op-
ponents for the Generals are last
year’s co-champions of the CAC and
the pre-season favorites to win again.
They are experienced and strong,
both offensively and defensively,
and are indicative of the strength
that dwells in the CAC. I am speak-
ing of the Colonels of Centre Col-
lege who will invade Wilson Field
on October 4. This is W&L’s home-
coming, fans. The turnout for last
week’s game was good. It should be
better this weekend; so come on out
and scream your heads off and we'll
give you next weekend off.

By the way, if you think W&L
was badly beaten, try some of these
scores: 62-0, 77-14, 63-14, 49-7,
and how about 52-14, Colt fans?

opposite effect. The news media will
jump at any wild displays of dis-
order—even if they are few and iso-

Instead of making the United
States more anti-war, the result
would be to make it more anti-col-
