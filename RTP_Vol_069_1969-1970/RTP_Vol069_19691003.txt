Doremus Concert Tonight

A Friday night concert, alumni
reunions, and a football game with
Centre College will highlight this
weekend’s Homecoming actiivties.

Also scheduled during an unusu-
ally busy weekend are meetings of
the University’s Board of Trustees
and a dinner Friday night in Evans
Dining Hall given to the Trustees
for the Robert E. Lee Associates.
The 193 associates are persons who
have supported the school in an ex-
ceptionally generous way.

The main feature of the weekend
for students will be lan and Sylvia’s
concert in Doremus gymnasium at
8 p.m. Friday. This is the first time
a concert has been provided for
Homecomings, according to Dance
Board president Dean Kumpuris.

The major reason for a concert
this weekend is that the Dance Board
feels students shouldn't have to wait
as long as in the past to appreciate
the benefits of the dance plans they
have purchased, Kumpuris said.

Kumpuris suggested that those at
tending the concert dress casually

SIPA Convention Shifted

Management and sponsorship of
the Southern Interscholastic Press
Association (SEPA) has been shifted
from Washington and Lee University
to the University of Georgia by
agreement between the two univer-
silies.

Founded at Washington and Lee
in 1925, SEPA brings editors of high
school publications from Southern
and border states to an annual con-
vention at which leaders in the com
munications media speak and evalu-
ate student work. About 1,200 per-
sons have attended each convention
in Lexington in recent years.

Details of the shift of sponsor-
ship to the Henry W. Grady School
of Journalism at the University of
Georgia's Athens campus were an
nounced yesterday by Professor
Paxton Davis, director of the Lee
Memorial Journalism Foundation,
which has sponsored SIPA. The
shift is effective immediately.

Davis said that under the W&L—
Georgia agreement “no fundamental!
changes” are planned in the SIPA
programs and policies. Present mem
bers will be eligible for continued
membership. The spring SIPA con
vention will be held at Georgia.

In his letter, Davis said that “for
some years now,” all persons in
volved in sponsorship and manage
ment of SIPA “have been concerned
about its growing size, the complex
ity of the problems that its size in
turn created, and the administrative
difficulties that came with the devel
oping success of the SIPA program

more than a decade the annual
spring SIPA convention has taxed
to the utmost the facilities of both.”

“Our alternatives seemed to us to
be limited.” he added. “One was to
impose drastic restrictions on at-
tendance at SIPA. Another was to
move the convention to a summer
date. Obviously either would have
altered radically the character of the
association.

“Realizing this, we slowly turned
our thinking to a third possibility:
that we transfer SIPA to a larger
institution with greater and more
fiexible facilities.”

Davis said the decision was reach-
ed “only reluctantly and after long
hours of thought and consideration,”
but he added that “it is our convic-
tion that only by transferring the
program to a larger institution can
its objectives be furthered and its
continued growth assured.”

October
Meeting

By Walt Potter

Stall Reporter
Rumbling noises are beginning to
be heard around W&L’s campus as

the proposed October 15 nationwide
moratorium draws near.

A small group of students and
faculty have reserved Lee Chapel
for all day Sunday to hold an or-
ganizational meeting, among other
things, to try to coordinate all the
various campus groups who are
planning action on the 15th.

“with confi-

the group has also reserved Lee
Chapel for 2 p.m. on the 15th for
an as yel undetermined action.

\iso planned at the Sunday gath
ering are at least three speeches in
the morning with the possibility of

ihree more. Discussion groups afe

Ihe definite speakers for Sunday
morning include Dr. David Sprunt,

dence.” The Henry W. Grady School
is “outstanding,” its faculty has
broad experience in communications,
and the Athens campus is well suit-
ed for increasing opportunities for
an improved convention, Davis said.

The faculty member at the Uni-
versity of Georgia who will be in
charge of SIPA will be Dr. Jeff
Clark, professor of journalism there.
He will serve until a permanent di-
rector is named. Dr. Warren K.
Agee is dean of the Grady School.

The first convention of SIPA was
held on April 5 and 6, 1926. Con-
ventions were held annually until
1942 when travel restrictions and
other war-time difficulties caused a

suspension of activities until the
1946-47 school year.
In recent years, distinguished

journalists who spoke to the high
school editors at the Lexington con-
vention included James _ Reston,,
Marquis Childs, Howard K. Smith,
and Tom Wicker.

and bring blankets to sit on, since
no formal seating will be provided.

This informality is a deliberate
change of pace, Kumpuris said. The
format is intended to be reminiscent
of that of last year’s “Love-In 69”
at Fancy Dress,

Kumpuris added that this is the
only concert scheduled for the gym
this year. All others will be in the
fieldhouse at Virginia Military In-
stitute, since that building has better
acoustics.

Admission for students without
dance plans will be $10. However,
Kumpuris said anyone who wants
a dance plan but does not have the
$40 now should contact him or talk
to someone at the door. An arrange-
ment for a student in such a situa-
tion to get a dance plan now and
pay when he has the money will
then be arranged. The concert will
be another event open to the ap-
proximately 400 alumni and _ their
wives expected to be at the re-
unions of the academic and law
classes of 1924, 1934, 1939, 1949,
and 1964.

Fall class reunions are being
started this year in an attempt to
increase the opportunity for alumni
to return to Washington and Lee
for reunions, explained William C.
Washburn, alumni secretary.

With reunions of five classes con-
tinuing to be held in the spring, this
new program will make it possible
for an alumnus to return for a re-
union every fifth year, he said.

Ihe weekend begins for alumni
at 2 p.m. with registration at the
Alumni House lasting until 4 p.m.
From 3:30 to 5 p.m., Dr. Ollinger
Crenshaw, Professor of History and
University Historian, will be in the
University Bookstore to meet alum-
ni and autograph copies of General
Lee’s College, his history of W&L
which was published earlier this
year by Random House.

From § to 6 p.m., a cocktail party
honoring alumni will be given by
the Rockbridge County alumni chap-
ter at the Alumni House. Refresh
ments will be served at the Alumni
House at 10 p.m. after the concert.

A discussion of “Timely Topics”
will be held at 10 a.m. Saturday
in Lee Chapel. The topics are wheth-

The group, whose principal mem
bers were named as Dr. Paul Beebe,
instructor in History, Dr. David
Zucker, professor of English, and
students Pete Zimmerman and Pleas
Geter, has still more plans for later
in the week.

The students, at a meeting Wed
nesday night, considered a bell ring-

march demonstration for Wednes
day afternoon, and more discussion
groups.

The group also plans to promul-

gate a university siatement on the
war to be sent to President Nixon.
fhe statement is slated not to be
extremely pascifist, but still more
anti-war than the President's posi-
lion.

Other possible actions include
concerts on the WAL grounds, par-
ades, and street theater.

The group also states that it has

response.

Following open house in the cen-

ter, alumni will be served luncheon
in Evans Dining Hall.

Special guests at the dedication
will be the families of the two bene-
factors who made the Early-Field-
ing Memorial Building, the Student
Center, possible.

Bequests by Mrs. Annie Fielding
Early of Washington, D.C., and her
daughter, Mrs. Annie Early Fairfax
of Washington, D.C. and Roanoke,
Va. provided the funds to build the
center.

The Washington and Lee Band
will make their first appearance this
weekend at the game. Unlike previ-
ous years, where the band has actu-
ally been nothing more than an ex-
tension of the ROTC band, the band
this year has become an integral
part of the University, and hoeps to
have uniforms shortly.

At 2:30 p.m. at Wilson Field, the
WA&L Generals will play the Home-
coming Football Game against the
Centre College Colonels of Ken-
tucky.

WLUR-FM, the university-spon-
sored radio station, will provide its
first play-by-play broadcast of a
home game when W&L meets Cen-
tre. Jay Dorman and Waugh Crig-
ler, both former members of the
football team, will be the station's
announcers.

A party for alumni will be held
at the Alumni House after the game.
At 7 p.m., the Reunion Classes will
hold their anniversary banquets at
various locations in Lexington.

Friday

Friday, October 3, 1969

On October 15

The Executive Committee’s resolution calling student
attention to the proposed anti-war moratorium on Oct. 15
is bound to cause a lot of comment.

Many will say that the EC exceeded the limits of its duties
and responsibilities in dealing with a matter not explicitly
assigned to it by the Student Body Constitution. Both the
EC and the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi have, we believe, effec-
tively refuted this argument.

On the other hand, probably equal numbers will con-
clude that the resolution is too weak considering the magni-
tude of its subject. We think not. A stronger resolution might
have failed, and the historical significance alone—that the
EC has finally broadened its scope to a degree approaching
awareness—is great enough to admit compromise for the
sake of its passage. More important, of course, is that it
neither forces nor advocates a particular viewpoint, which
would have been presumptuous. Rather, it reasonably and
fairly suggests individual thought and action on the matter.

Both these extremes, we feel, are minorities. There is a
strong possibility that the majority will decide whatever ac-
tion taken on Oct. 15 will be of no consequence to continu-
ed involvement in the war, and therefore will do nothing.
Such a position is both false and dangerous. This protest
promises to be the best organized and most widespread effort
in a lengthening list of demonstrations against the war, and
as such cannot help but attract the attention of the shapers
of foreign policy. The participation of such schools as W&L
is particularly crucial, however, if this demonstration is to
carry the impact that it might, and it is for that reason we
fear the cynicism that could minimize the response here.

We suspect dissatisfaction with the war is quite prevalent
even at W&L, but largely because of a combination of apathy
and patience it has yet to manifest itself to any meaningful
extent. Precisely because W&L and schools like it have been
detached up to now would the participation of a large number
of their students have perhaps a greater effect on the nation’s
leaders than mere lack of numbers, and hopefully of vio-
lence, might lead one to believe.

The EC would have been remiss in a basic obligation to
remain apolitical had it called for a definitive and public—
though peaceful—gesture from every individual who dis-
agrees with U.S. involvement in Vietnam. We operate under
no such restrictions, and we advocate that action.

A Bad Sign

If the most recent Interfraternity Council meeting is
any indication of the direction—or indirection—that group
intends to pursue, there is little doubt in our minds that abso-
lutely nothing of any significance will originate there this
year.

The only unambiguous action occurring Monday night
was merely an announcement regarding CONTACT assess-
ments. The rest of the meeting was marked by a chaos we
could hardly believe, and the only actions proceeding from it
were not only confusing but for the most part the result of
breaches in Roberts Rules of Order, and hence their validity
is questionable.

The casual manner in which President Chuck Cahn han-
dled the most important matter yet to be considered this year
is a case in point, but by no means the only example. We are
speaking, of course, of the move to reform parietal regula-
7 ;
tions applying to fraternity houses. The Judicial Board's
proposal was, in the first place, an afterthought, since the
first meeting of the Student Affairs Committee had already
passed before the IFC moved to take any action in its own
behalf.

That could be excused. After all, the proposal can’t be
voted on by the entire faculty until this Monday.
Thus the week of inaction by the IFC caused no real delay in
the proposal’s implementation, provided it does pass at the
Monday faculty meeting. What is crucial, and may conceiv-
ably be calamitous, is the fact that the proposal is scantily
worded, nearly an exact copy of the revised dorm regulations
and offers those regulations as its only real defense. There are
many good reasons why parietal regulations ought to be re-
laxed, but the proposal overlooks most of them. Moreover,
the conclusiveness of the vote taken is open to question, since
the number of affirmative votes was not recorded and a call
for negative votes either was not made or was inaudible,

Clearly, Cahn was operating under two assumptions:

(1) that no fraternity is against the proposal, and

(2) that the faculty will inevitably pass it.

He is no doubt correct in his first assumption, but that is no
excuse for the casual manner in which the voting was handled
A unanimous vote is much more convincing than simple
passage. If his second premise proves likewise correct, and
we sincerely hope it does, it will be the result of the faculty's
innate sense of fairness and not because of any action the
fraternities, through the IFC, took in their own behalf,

Fraternities are becoming increasingly embattled at Wash.
ington and Lee, and if they are to maintain themselves at all,
it will be through collective and forceful action. The IFC ap-
pears unwilling to provide it.

I’m sure Black students would love it in Lexington

The Admission Dilemma

By RICHARD CAPRON

Washington and Lee University in

its present catalogue claims “to
seek candidates for admission with-
out regard to race, color, religious
creed, or national origin.” It claims
that its students not only represent
broad geographic, but also broad
“social and economic cross-sections
of the United States.” On the other
hand, Washington and Lee has at
the present time only two black un-
dergraduates. There seems to be a
discrepancy between statement and
actuality. Wanting answers to some
questions in my mind, I stopped by
the office of James Farrar, Dean of
Admissions, last Tuesday.

This past year a grand total of
five black students applied for ad-
mission, Four were accepted, All
four, though they were offered gen-
erous financial aid, turned down
WAL to go to northern colleges.
This was a hard blow to the Admis-
sions office.

Swallowing defeat, the administra-
tion has begun to intensify its ef-
forts to recruit poor white and black
students. Through the National A-
chievement Scholarship Program,
which supplies lists of qualified and
commended students, and the OPEN
program, which seeks out inner city
youngsters with promise, strides are
being made in this direction.

Project Access, an organization
mothered by the College Board serv-
ice, also helps identify those deserv-
ing studenis by means of a series of
tests. There is even a program that
will help to waive the test fees for
those who cannot afford to pay.
Other endeavors such as Upward
Bound improve the educational stan-
dards of under-privileged high
school students by summer study at
various colleges and universities.

However, programs such as these
are only secondary. Washington and
Lee is going to a professional agency
that deals with the problem, but so
are dozens of other colleges. The
competition in this area is extremely
intense.

Somehow there must be more di-
rect contact with the individual gui-
dance departments and the high
school students themselves. This
year with additional staff personnel,
the Admissions office is hoping to
increase its visitation potential, es-
tablishing contacts with some of the
public high schools where they
haven't been before. Through the
College Night programs in Rich-
mond, Norfolk, and other cities, the
University is able to make some
headway.

But this is the limit of the admini-
siration’s efforts in seeking a more
diverse student body. It seems that
nobody is addressing his actions to
the question of why black studenis
would rather go to a comparable
northern school than to WAL.

The answer is quite simple. Very
few black or poor white students
want to go to a school whose en-
vironment is only adopted to the
middie and upper class white. As
one black student who graduated
from a white prep school said,
“Sometimes I just like to see a
sroup of black faces.”

So it not only becomes a problem
of seeking these studenis, but also
of providing them with some sort
of acceptable social atmosphere. In
conjunction with this. | would like
to see the administration and the
surrounding girls’ schools, most of
whom face the same problems that
WAL does. join together to visit
various Cities throughout the region,
conducting forums and group coun
seling sessions. This would at least
show an active concern for their
social. as well as economic and
academic welfare.

Another difficulty arises when one
asks the question of how many
blacks want to come to a school
with an all white faculty. | think jis

about time the department heads
got busy looking around for black
professors as well as white. Com-
petition for qualified black profes-
sors is as tough as it is for the stu-
dents, but with a faculty whose
average salary is far above the na-
tional average, there must be some-
body willing to teach here.

Another possibility that has not
been sought out as actively as it
could is that of encouraging the
graduates of two year institutions
(junior and community colleges) to
complete their education at Wash-
ington and Lee. Many students who
cannot qualify with their high school
records get to college and find they
can do much better. Those young
men who have themselves at the col-
lege level should become prime tar-
gets for admission.

As a last desperate attempt at
bringing some color to Washington
and Lee, the administration might
try to institute a foreign exchange
program with any of the predomin-
antly black universities. Perhaps
black students might not mind com-
ing here for a semester or two to
receive credit,

In finishing my talk with Dean
Farrar, | asked him if he forsaw
any problems if W&L is unsuccess-
ful in enrolling blacks. To this he
replied that he thought the student
body would be missing a vital part
of a liberal education in our modern

To Sleep,

world, where understanding the
black is becoming more and more
important. This is most assuredly
true,

I wonder, however, how long
Washington and Leet is going to be
able to isolate itself from the grow-
ing impetus of radicalism on Ameri-
can campuses. Several questions re-
main unanswered in this regard,
How long will SDS and the various
militant groups allow our lily white
school to continue, before it starts
to take action? How long will our
own students tolerate this discrep-
ancy between policy and practice?
How long will it be before W&L
confronts the demands of our rest-
less social structure? Time grows
short.

 

To the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi

It is quite interesting to analyze
the speech of the valedictorian of
the class of 1969 (printed in the
Sept. 26 R-tP) in terms of how fully
his words may express the despair
of the great majority of students at
WAL. It is a very disappointing ex-
perience to realize that when we
finally attain the material goals that
we set before ourselves, or more
aptly our society sets before us,
that our inner longings and dissatis-
factions are still unabated. The vale-
dictorian is a near perfect example.
He had reached the top of material
achievement—he had a straight 4.0
average Over his college career, he
was a member of the Executive
Committee, he was an outstanding
athlete for the football and track
teams, he was chairman of Contact,
and even was nominated for a
Rhodes Scholarship. He was every-
thing that the world could ever ex-
pect a man to be and yet he is
obviously quite dissatisfied with his
plight. But he falls into the usual
trap of placing the blame of his des-
pair upon the university or just the
world in general; this is very false
and yet we all tend to do this. In-
stead shouldn't we all look not at
the external world for blame but at
our own values and purposes in life.
Obviously self fulfillment is not to
be gained in external achievement;
but perhaps the answer lies in being
“transparent” with all our weak-
nesses “before the Power that posit-
ed us” as Kierkegaard expresses it.
In any event we can’t hope that the
world or this university has been
created to satisfy our longings and
despair, the problem is a lot deeper
than that.

Rush to Judgement

By Dave Olson

Hopefully we have seen the last
of the old rush system. After a hec-
tic week of rush dates, bids and
other boring details it is apparent
that it is now time for the rush
system to change at W&L. Last year
the IFC failed to institute a plan of
deferred rush. With academic pres-
sures increasing yearly, deferred rush
is now, not a luxury, but a necessity,

W&L remains as one of the few

Perchance to Cut?

By Lawrence McConnell

Ihe War in Vietnam has been
forensic fodder for at least five years
in all parts of our country, but it is
imMeresting to note that in the year
of our Lord nineteen-hundred and
sixty-nine, the debate has finally
blossomed into prominance in the
WAL community.

Not only has the topic of Viet-
nam reached the supposedly un-
aware masses in our community, but
also we have the innovation of a
new debate: where and how the de-
bate on Vietnam will be conducted.
In fact, the only agreement you
will find in the W&L debate on the
debate on Vietnam is that an ad in
the New York Times started it all.

The story here starts with the
EC's resolution which called for
everyone's awareness of the Vietnam
problem on October 15. At this
moment, the word moratorium be-
gan floating about as a result of the
New York Times’ ad which called
for a faculty and student boycott of
classes on the 15th.

Active anti-moratory forces have
been the voices of Junior EC mem-
ber Staman Ogilvie, who said that
& moratorium would be a good ex-
cuse for students not to attend class
that day, and Jeff Spence, whe wrote
to the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi calling
for an in-class “Teach-In" on that
day. Then there was an abstaining
voice on the EC, that of Vice Presi
dent Joe Tompkins who refused even
fo vote on the whole matter

Wednesday night the pro-mora
tory ranks met to discuss the organ-
ization for their planned meeting on
Sunday afternoon at 2:00 in Lee
Chapel. With approximately 75
anti-war people assembled and three
AOl-sO-anli-war personages, the ga-
thering attempted to organize the
program for the October 15 mora
torium. During this portion of the
Meeting, the major organization
man seemed to be Pete Zimmerman
who proposed a schedule for the
15th and a presentation that he gave
to the faculty EC yesterday

Towards the end of their Wednes
day nighi meeting. the three moder
ates Were asked to leave because the

anti-war group wished to form plans
of their own for the 15th.

This was a singular event, especi-
ally after Pete Zimmerman had
commented earlier Wednesday that
“this is neither an anti-war nor a
pro-war demonstration. Call it a
“Think-In.” We are trying to avoid
any bias, and are doing our best to
get speakers to represent all posi-
tions.” Though the speakers may
represent all positions, the eventual
audience that Zimmerman and his
people may draw on the 15th will
be defeating the only vaguely valid
purpose of the whole attempt.

If Zimmerman and others plan to
carry off an event of any magnitude
at all, the coordination of those
pro-war, moderate, and anti-war is
essential. If this coordination does
not jell (and after Wednesday night,
coordination doesn't look possible),
then the validity of all those anti-
war people who want to spend Octo-
ber 15 discussing and demonstrating
their disgust with the War seems
questionable at best.

Zimmerman and others say they
are trying “to bring groups to-
gether.” And if the convocation on
October 15 is to be a success in any
sense, they can’t afford to lose any-
one interested

Whatever happens, October 15
will come and go. Some students
may go to the proposed discussion
group; others may attend class: and
there will almost definitely be some
who won't set their alarm clocks the
night before

A Word of Warning
To W&L Activists

\ word of caution for WAL's
“ive students on the 18th of
October: the city of Lexington’s
anti-litter law forbids the distribu-
ton of handbills on the streets of
Lexingion, The reason? Once the
handbills are given out, they tend
to be thrown away on the streets by
the recipients, hence the person dis-
tributing the handbills is, in effect,

littering

colleges in America with such an
intensely short rush, which is a bur-
den on the freshmen, the fraterni-
ties and the administration. With a
longer rush period the freshmen
would get a better chance to get a
true picture of the houses they visit
and the fraternities could see the
rushees in a better perspective. The
present rush system is conducted at
a very high pitch, It is very pres-
surized. With a longer rush system
the whole atmosphere of rush would
become more casual, friendly and
a lot easier on nerve ends. It would
be much harder for the houses and
the freshmen to “put on airs” and
the true character of a house or
rushee would shine through.

One of the arguments that fra
ternities have long used against de-
ferred rush is that they would be
overburdened financially. They
would be without the income from
freshmen house bills for the entire
first semester. But with deferred
rush the very large expense of a
week-long rush could be spread over
an entire semester. Of course this
does not balance out and there is no
feasible way this money could be
obtained; it is just a question of
whether or not the fraternities are
willing to make the sacrifice and
adopt a system which is to their ad-
vantage.

It is very easy to criticize, but
what about concrete suggestions?
The best way to handle deferred
rush would be to spread it out over
the entire first semester with pledg-
img permitted at the beginning of
the second semester, Instead of open
houses we could substitute longer
“smokers” — lasting approximately
ninety minutes. The freshmen would
sign up for these in much the same
way as they did for open houses.
As in the old system a rushee could
then be invited for longer “happy
hours” or for combo parties. Again
as in the old system liquor would be
permitted during the “happy hours”
but not at the “smokers”. rhe “smo-
kers” could take place twice a week
{fo get in the required nunrber of
houses in a feasible length of time)
and combo parties could be sche-
duled as in the past with the “happy
hours” once a week after the “smo-
kers” have been completed, With a
longer period of time in between
these gatherings the handling of
dirty rush and no contact becomes
more important to the successful
operation of rush. The freshmen, as
it is NOW, are separated from the
rest of the stuednt body. The only
Way to handle this is to have no
contact, outside of rushing, for the
entire first semester, The freshmen
would have to satisfy themselves
with what the student union can pro-
vide, The acquisition of dates could
be handied by a bus service or fresh
men could be allowed to have cars.
The student union and dorm parie
tals were instituied for the express

WEL Soccer Team Remains Unbeaten
In 4-0 Victory Over Hampden-Sydney

Washington and Lee’s young soc-
cer team upped its record to 2-0 by
defeating an inexperienced yet tough
Hampden-Sydney team 4-0 on Octo-
ber 1. After leading by only one
goal at half time, the Generals open-
ed up the game in the second half
by scoring three times.

Dave Manson put the home team
ahead with 5:55 left in the second
quarter when he got credit for a
goal that actually went into the
Hampden-Sydney net off one of the
H-S players. Manson, a sophomore
inside right, was given credit for the
goal because he had been the last
WAL player to touch the ball

The Generals did not waste any
time, however, in stretching this
lead to 2-0 once the second half be-
gan. Don Belt received a beautiful
pass from freshman right
wing, Tom Krampfmuller, and Belt
did not miss the mark with a perfect
head shot,

Eleven minutes later, Carl Hyatt,
the left halfback let go a fine loft
shot that the Hampden-Sydney

goalie had no chance for. The ball
sailed high into the netting, and
WAL led 3-0.

An extra insurance goal was scor-
ed by John Yow, senior left wing,
with 16:40 left in the fourth quar-
ter. Yow beat the H-S goalie with a
quick shot on the right side, giving
the Washington and Lee team its
fourth and final goal.

After the game, Coach Joe Lyles
was asked if he now thought W&L
could continue this balance of of-
fensive punch and fine defensive
play.

“We'll just have to wait and see.
This is a very young team,” Lyles
replied. “Em certainly pleased,
though, with the improvement that
the fullbacks and halfbacks have

made since the first game. Brian
Price and Mark Sayers played es-
pecially well.”

The team has been drililng this
past week on the weaknesses that
were evident in the first game against
Pfeiffer College. “Getting the young
players reading the field and the
movements of their own teammates
correctly is one of our biggest prob-
lems,” remarks Coach Lyles. When
the team achieves this, the other
weaknesses as listed by Coach Lyles,
(finer touch on passes from backs to
insides and wings, better field bal-
ance) will probably iron themselves
out,

Ihe next game for the soccer team
is Saturday against Madison College
on the Eastern Mennonite field.

Washington and Lee will open its
1969 College Athletic Conference
competition tomorrow by playing
host to Centre College’s high-scor-
ing Colonels in the annual Home-
coming game,

Che Kentuckians were pre-season
favorites to win the CAC conference
crown, and as Coach Buck Leslie
said today, “they backed that up
last Saturday by beating Southwes-
tern, 21-7.” Centre and Southwes-
terdn shared the conference cham-
pionship last year,

Early scouting reports and films
“show that Centre has a good foot-
ball team, to say the least,” Coach
Leslie said. “They have 25 letter-
men back, they have a lot of scor-
ing potential (49 points so far in
two games), and they can play good
defense as well.”

Despite last week’s disappointing

loss to Howard Stevens and his
Randolph - Macon teammates,
Coach Leslie and his Generals are
“not discouraged.”

“We know we are inexperienced
in a lot of areas,” Leslie commented,
“but we think we are making im-
provements.”

One such area is in the passing
department, now that senior quarter-
back Jack Baizley appears fully re-
covered from a pre-season broken
hand. Baizley got the stalled W&L
offense in gear against Randolph-
Macon, completing nine passes for
69 yards en route to both touch-
downs,

Besides Baizley, Coach Leslie
singled out for praise halfback JoJo
Martin, who gained 69 tough yards
on the ground; pass catching ends
Steve Mahaffey and John Thomas;
fullback Doug Gossmann for his

W&L Football vs. Notre Dame’s?
Well, It’s A Thought Anyway

Editor's Note: The following is a
reprint from The Courier-Journal,
Louisville, Ky. The story was run
on September 25 of this year.

What's the difference between
scholarship and non-scholarship
football?

Money, perhaps. One institution
seems to have as much fun as an-
other. They have similar worries
about injuries, next opponents and
overconfidence.

The alumnus of Washington and
Lee (no scholarships) delights in
victory as much as the alumnus of
Notre Dame, whic his generally re-
garded as the symbol of bigtime
football.

We listened to the voices of Ara
Parseghian, coach of Notre Dame,
and Buck Leslie, coach of Washing-
ton and Lee, yesterday morning.
Parseghian, whose home attendance
was 366,450 last season, was just
as worried about upcoming Purdue
as Leslie, home attendance 15,000,
was concerned about Randolph-
Macon.

Football is a great common deno
minator. It makes friends of kings
and paupers. Not that Washington
and Lee is a pauper. It has chosen
de-emphasized type football and ap-
pears to like it,

Said Leslie:

“We don't want to lose a single
game but we have to face up to it:
Competition for the student-athlete
is great, and here we are, pioneers
in the business of not giving any
athletic scholarships. If we consis
tently play .500 football or better,
this is what we call success.

Leslie and the other W and |
couches recruit young men with ath
letic ability just as hard as any
other college coach. He and his
stall are constantly in correspond
ence with prospects.

“Washington and Lee is a great
educational institution with a rich
tradition and heritage,” said Leslie,
who can be excused if he sounds
like a handout from the university's
public relation soffice. He is a W
ind L graduate
This is what we have to offer a

see him that day at practice.”

Looking at emphasized football,
Notre Dame and other big time
schools resent the thought that they
are football factories. They enroll
students, too, and they'll compare
curriculums with any de-emphasiz-
ed plant.

While Leslie is quivering about
Randolph-Macon, Parseghian fears
Purdue, as did Chicago’s Alonzo
Stagg before him.

Why worry with a program that
attracted a total of 15,000 spectators
last season compared with Notre
Dame's 366,450?

Leslie has the answer.

“We feel that our program is a
vital outlet for the energies of these
young men. As long as there are
good sports programs in colleges,
the hippies and the yippies are not
going to take over this country.”

rhe spirit is the same, whether
the crowd is 2,500 or 60,000.

blocking, and guard Staman Ogilvie,
from the offensive team.

On defense, Leslie cited his trio
of defensive backs, John Nolan,
Dave Brooks, and Lee Graham, and
end Scott Neese. Brooks and Neese
are just sophomores.

Giving credit where it was de-
finitely due, the W&L coach praised
the Jackets’ Stevens highly. “He
could play on any team in the
country,” Leslie said.

“Without Stevens, it should have
been a fairly close game,” the W&L
coach continued. “He just has too
much speed. In order to pursue him,
we had to gamble and not rush the
passer, so they hurt us with their
passing. Credit that to Stevens too.”

The Centre-W&L contest stacks
up as a close affair. Both teams are

now I-l for the season. Centre,
which won last year, 10-0, on its
own field, appears to have the

stronger team. But W&L has the
home field advantage.

And another thing: it's W&L’s
Homecoming. The Generals seem to
play inspired ball before the return
ing old grads. Kickoff at W&L’s
Wilson Field will be at 2:30 p.m.

Dance Policies Discussed

By Monty Cottier

The imminence of this year's
Homecomings Weekend once again
brings the Dance Board into the eye
of the W&L student. As there have
been changes made in the operations
of this body, as well as some poss-
ible misunderstandings, the Ring
tum Phi selected this Homecomings
edition to examine the current state
of the Dance Board’s yearly plans,
and re-state some of the new rules
concerning admission prices and
transferral of dance plans,

Although the totals at our
posal do not include the last weeks’
sales, nor door receipts, the rough
total for this year is slightly less
than three-fourths that of last year,
and must finance an additional week-
end,

or a combination of the two.”

“A program of this nature we be-
lieve would indicate our humanitar-
ian concern with the war and at the
same time serve the University’s in-
terest in furthering our education.”

In the area of transferring dance
plans to other students for concerts
which a student will not attend,
Dean Kumpuris, Dance Board presi-
dent, reminds, “This is an honor vio-
lation. The EC voted on this last
year, and this is what they decided.”

Although plans have not vet been
made for all of the weekends,
Homecomings, with Lan and Sylvia,

will cost about $3500; Openings will
run $8500; and Fancy Dress, with
Count Bassie at $3500 and an
other band not yet formally con-
tracted, have been fairly well plann-
ed through. Springs and Finals have
not yet been booked, as the Dance
Board wishes to see what name
bands or groups will be playing in
the area at those times,

no reason why it should not work
here. Obviously this system does
present some problems but | feel

these problems are far outweighed
by the advantages of the system. It
is, | believe, a system which is bet
ter for both the fraternities and the
freshmen. It is a much more casual
set-up than before and would be a
lot less intense. Last year the IFC
voided the question, but now, with
the student union completed, there
is no substantial argument that could
be offered aaginst a deferred rush
system. The old sysiem is antiqu
ated, expensive and unwieldy. 1 be
lieve any new system to be an im
provement. Academic pressures are
increasing yearly. This, combined
with pledge responsibilities, might
be too much to handle if a freshman
is to be successful. Further, the stu-

dent union can fulfill the social
needs of the freshmen. It is now
time to change if the fraternity

system wishes to prolong its life on
this campus.
