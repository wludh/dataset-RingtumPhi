Basie bows out
of Fancy Dress
Ball engagement

CHECK-UP NEEDED

Friends of Distinction or
Sweet Water for concert

Much like Sisyphus whose rock
kept rolling down the hill when it
reached the apex, the Dance Board
has had another setback, not how-
ever caused by their own sins.

Bob Kasha of Willard Alexander,
Inc., contacted the Dance Board this
past week, announcing that Count
Basie and his orchestra will be un-
able to appear on Friday, January
31, of Fancy Dress. The announce-
ment came as a total surprise to
the Board which had received a
verbal commitment from the Count
himself.

The reason for the Count’s in-
ability to appear stems from his
doctor's ordering him to have a
routine medical examination during
the time period of January 23
through February 5. This immedi-
ately eliminated the WA&L date
which the band-leader had let slip
his mind. So, once again the Dance
Board falls prey to another enter-
tainment group canceling out on
the school.

The saddest part of the entire
mix-up is that the Dance Board
will receive the brunt of the critic-
ism caused by the Count’s cancela-
tion. This year the Dance Board
has done everything in its power to
provide Washington and Lee with
the best entertainment which its
budget can afford. It is unfortunate
that such a blot on its record should
be made. not through any fault of
its own, but rather that of others.

Other orchestras are now being
considered by the Board in order
to replace Basie, but the time is
drawing very close to Fancy Dress.
The Glenn Miller Orchestra, di-
rected by Buddy DeFranco, has been
highly recommended and may re-
ceive the bid for the January dance
set. However, it is only speculation
at this time

On Saturday night either the
Friends of Distinction or Sweet
Water will entertain. The choice for
this night hinges on whether the
Sweet Water, a California group,
will be on the East coast during
January. Otherwise, the Friends of
Distinction, known best for their
hit single “Grazing in the Grass,”
will appear for the concert.

Cancer in concert tonight
for College Inn audience

Cancer is both a disease and an
astrological sign, but at WAL it
is the name of a progressive rock
group. Its members are Gordon
Beall, bass; Mac Bogert, vocal; Clay
Hemphill, organ and vocal; Peter
Homans, lead guitar; Ray Royce,
vocal; and Harry Salzberg, drums.

So far this year the group has
been arranging songs written by
other rock groups, such as the Jef-
ferson Airplane, the Who, the
Beatles, and Santana. Recently, they
have started work on original ma-
terial and eventually hope to have
enough songs to record.

This material reflects the import-
ant influence of a certain group
on all the guys in the band. “Procul
Harum,” a British rock group who
are Classically trained, have indi-
cated to Cancer the need to write
music from an intellectual as well
as emotional point of view. “We
would like to think that the response
to our sound is as challenging in-
tellectually as it is poignant,” Beall
said.

In reference to the band’s pur-
pose, Mac Bogert says, “Our am-
bition is not to make money, but
to become musicians.” For this rea-
son their music is “rock,” not “soul,”
oriented. Also, the members have
decided not to sign with a promo-
tion agency.

Cancer was formed in September
by a merger of the two rock groups
that were on campus, “The Second
Coming” and “Free Lance.”

The band practices three times a
week in the basement of the stu
dent center and has played at the

The guys in the band share with
all students a desire that there be
live music available on weekends,
though a definite place has not been
established as yet. Tonight, from
8:30-11, Cancer will present a con-
cert at the College Inn. There is a
$1.50 fee per person.

Actually, the band is striving to
do more at W&L than to play and
promote progressive rock. They feel
that music is an experience that can
be shared by all. As Clay Hemphil
says, “There is unity inherent in
the musical expression.” It is the
band's belief that their music can
unite a student body.

IFC debating popular election
of president and vice-president

At last night's IFC meeting a
motion was introduced to allow for
the popular election of the IFC
president and vice-president. The
motion was referred to committee.

The motion, drawn up by Jim
Matthews and Reeve Kelsey, pro-
vided for the election of the presi-
dent and vice-president by all fra-
ternity members in a method similar
to that of the Student Body Presi-
dent. The election of the remaining
Judicial Board would remain un-
changed. The present system for the
election of the IFC president has
the nomination of the candidates
one week, and the election the next
week with each fraternity having
one vote.

Several of the reasons advanced
for the change included the hope
that a popularly elected president
could give the IFC better prestige
and leadership with a mandate from
at least half of the fraternity mem-
bers. Also cited would be the in-
creased articulation of issues, the
introduction of fresh blood into the
IFC, and a reduction in the oli-
garchical tendencies of the present
system.

Several members expressed res-
ervations on the proposed amend-
ment. They felt that since the issue
was now opened if would be best

for the IFC to consider all pos-
sible alternatives to the present
selection method and then choose
the best alternative. The motion

was referred to a committee (by a
17-0 vote) for just this reason. Presi-
dent Chuck Cahn will name a com-
mittee to work on this matter.

In other action, Cahn urged fra-
ternities to give some sort of com-
pensation for the responsibilities of
their officers and their obligation to
live in the house. He suggested free
room and perhaps a reduction in
board.

The resolution presented by the
IFC follows:

Washington and Lee has a movie
program at last, owing primarily to
the efforts of a pair of freshmen:
Bill Millkey and Bob Lang. The
idea for such a program began last
year. It was noted by the Executive
Committee that W&L had no pro-
gram of any kind for the showing
of feature films. Supporters of the
program pointed out that many other
schools already have such programs
offering free movies to students on
Saturday nights. So much interest
was generated in the program that
finally arrangements were made to
add a dollar to each student's dues
to cover the cost of the films. Acting
upon last year's initiatives, the EC
formed a committee this fall to
organize the film program and sup
ervise its functioning. Millkey and
Lang were chosen as co-chairmen

To date, the committee has had
no trouble in financing the movies
it is showing, but student interest
is lacking. Because they are new to
the operation of such a program,
Millkey and Lang have had some
difficulty in learning to operate it
efficiently. Adding to their problems
is the lack of any previous pro
gram upon which they might model
their own efforts. They claim that
student co-operation and assistance
would go along way toward a bet
ter film program. They note
that such popular movies as “Murd

Faculty voting on exchange
program in Dec. 1 meeting

This coming Monday the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty will meet
for the purpose of deciding the fate
of the proposed eight-college stu-
dent exchange program. Contrary to
popular opinion, W&L has not as
yet approved the program, and
neither have all the other schools
involved. December | will be the
day of decision for W&L.

The idea for such a program has
been present for a long time, but
specific action wasn't taken until last
February when the Presidents of
four women's colleges and four
men's colleges began meeting to dis-
cuss the feasibility of an exchange
program. The final guidelines for
the program were decided this past
July when the eight Presidents met
for three days at the Peaks of Otter
Lodge.

The plan which finally emerged
is more than an experiment in co-
education. It provides for exchanges
between men’s colleges and women’s
colleges themselves. Thus it seeks
both to diversify the individual cam-
puses and to expand the educational
offerings of each school, If the fac-
ulty passes the program as well as
all seven other colleges, WAL stu-
dents will be able to enroll for
their junior years at either Mary
Baldwin, Hollins, Randolph-Macon
Woman's College. Sweet Briar.
Davidson, Hampden-Sydney, or
Randolph-Macon.

Unfortunately, the program would
be limited to only thirty students.
In return W&L would take in thirty

exchange students. The number
could be less than thirty, but not
more.

At the end of the first vear the

program will be subject to review
by all eight colleges. At that time
it might be decided to abandon the
program, expand it, or modify it
in some ways, Each participating
school will be permitted to with-
draw if it so chooses,

Students enrolled in the exchange
program will be considered enroll-
ed at their home institution. By
that reasoning, the student pays his
normal tuition and fees along with
room and board payments to the
home school. The home institution
will then remit this to the host
school unless the tuition, fees and
other expenses of the host school

are less, in which cases those charges
will be paid.

Full credit will be given for all
the courses taken by exchange stu-
dents. These credits will be ac-
cepted at face value by the home
institution, but each student's pro-
gram must be approved by the home
school. All grades received at the
host school will be considered the
grades of record.

Most interesting, however, are the
rules concerning social regulations.
Both the academic and the other
(social) “regulations of the host
institution shall ordinarily apply to
a student under this program.” Thus
it is not inconceivable that a W&l
student at Hollins would have to

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper
Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Tuesday, November 25, 1969

To clarify an issue

Our more diligent readers must certainly be following
the one-shot-at-a-time war which has been raging in the
Letters to the Editor columns for the past month. This ex-
change of barbs began with a mild-toned unobtrusive plea
by “an alumnus and father” for W&L men to “have the
courage to continue to be different.”

Since that letter appeared, the issue involved—the value
of tradition at Washington and Lee—unfortunately has been
relegated to a status secondary to sarcasm on the part of sev-
eral students and alumni. Perhaps this is inevitable in debating
an abstruse point when all the arguments advanced are ap-
parently valid but too closely intertwined with emotion.
Nevertheless, somewhere beneath that murky mess of slung-
mud there lies a viable conclusion. To assist in the search for
that answer, we shall attempt to expurgate the issues and
incinerate the refuse which has accumulated,

The central question is whether or not a coat-and-tie,
etc. pertain to education. None of the antagonists or pro-
tagonists—whoever is which should be irrelevant—have de-
fined exactly what they mean by “education.” In the strict
literal sense, “education” is mental development gained from
instruction. Then how could a coat-and-tie aid the educational
process? But, how could it hinder?

This impasse can be averted without sacrificing accuracy,
since “education”? connotes much more, and rightly so, than
mental development. To name just two, moral development
and discipline—we do not absorb knowledge osmotically—
are certainly elements integral to an education. Surely no
intelligent person can believe that wearing a coat-and-tie
ipso facto indicates self-discipline. However, using the same
logic, just because someone dresses otherwise does not mean
that he lacks discipline. The non-conventional dresser can
possibly and simply utilize other standards of value, which
is fine. Of course, there are noticeable exceptions.

But would coercion be more successful? Forcing a lazy
student to tie a tie would not help him learn discipline or
anything.

Again, the issue devolves into a riddle. But, there is one
other consideration—“dignity” as the alumnus and father
wrote. Whether or not this is relevant to education is another
academic question. However, “dignity” does significantly
pertain to environment. A well-dressed person simply is more
appealing, and that is important.

We, students and alumni, should concentrate on proving
the importance of being a gentleman, not on name-calling
or trying to solve the insoluble problem of gauging the rela-
tion of dress to education. We should ask what value will
an education—strictly or loosely defined—have to someone
who operates at a disadvantage in his society? An attitude of
tolerant understanding, and then advice, is demanded; not
Mr. Gilmore’s (class of 1939) cry for blind removal of “any
such crud” from the University.

“Alumni arise, thumbs up, strike back,” writes Mr. Gil-
more. But help; set some examples; show the wisdom of
what you know; and “don’t criticize what you can’t under-
stand,”

 

One step closer

Last week we discussed the needs of the University in
the area of providing opportunities for foreign study to
students. We are delighted to hear that a positive plan is
being considered for possible implementation as early as
next year.

Professor David B. Dickens, chairman of the Foreign
Study Committee, announced that a questionnaire has been
circulated to freshmen and sophomores. The questionnaire
solicits information that will aid the committee in establish-
ing opportunities for study in Europe.

The most attractive feature of the proposed program is
its scheduling of study abroad during the short term if
possible. This seems to be the most effective use of the new
six-week term yet proposed, and we urge that the proposal
receive the consideration it deserves.

 

 

Toward a better system

The Student Curriculum Committee has also recently
directed its efforts in strengthening a weak area. On No-
vember 13 the committee submitted to its faculty counterpart
a report which recommends the overhauling of the fresh-
man advisory system.

This archaic system should definitely be revamped. In-
stead of finding an ally in their advisers, many freshmen fre-
quently regard them as aloof, inconsiderate, and in general
someone to be feared. This reality is hardly in alignment
with the desired effect, the accessibility of professors out-
side the classroom. A friend on the hill is always welcomed,
and the creation of such relationships could be greatly faci-

litated under the proposed system.
We would like to join the Student Curriculum Com-
mittee in encouraging the faculty group to conscientiously

weigh the merits of the proposal,

Student’s wife points out hazards

By MRS. SHERWIN JACOBS
Apt. 26 C, Hillside Terrace

We wish to call your attention to
what we consider an unjust act on
the part of the administration con-
cerning the married students hous-
ing.

Starting next year our rent will
be increased to $50 a month utilities
included. From the outside, this may
seem fair, but to the tenant, speci-
fically of “Hillside Terrace,” it is
an outrage! The following descrip-
tion is bearly tolerable at $38 a
month, at $50, it is absurd.

The picture you see is not simu-

lated, it is the real thing. The baby

silver tar paper quonset huts con-

housing are rendered as liveable and
attractive on the inside as the indi-
vidual student can, considering what
he has to work with. The three
room apartments are constructed of
tar paper over a wooden frame. The
inside walls are plaster board. There
is no insulation.

The apartments have been in use
since the war and show the signs of
age. The ceilings sag and let in the

Newman replies again

  

a

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

It is ridiculous that so much time
and emotion should be spent on
matters of personal taste. Washing-
ton and Lee has many more im-
portant topics to be discussed, such
as the size of our institution, proper
utilization of the six-week term, and
even the nature of education itself,
Nonetheless, | feel obligated to reply
to Mr, Gilmore's philippic, lest. sil-
ence be taken for approval or defeat.

First, | apologize to him for be-
ing “cute, sarcastic, and sophomoro-
nish.” My only hope is that when
I grow up I shall be able to write
sober rational responses like Mr.
Gilmore's. Knowing my limitations,
I will now try to work them into
my reply. °

Mr. Gilmore says “dress” and
“speak” are manifestations of self-
discipline. Later in his letter he
states that he would exclude “any
hot-shot from Lower Slobbovia High
School (who) doesn’t like it.” Realiz-
ing my intellectual limitations, I still
hesitantly venture the opinion that
this exclusion is discipline from with-
out rather than within. As long as
arbitrary standards are imposed, the
individual has no opportunity to ex-
hibit discipline, only adherence to
the fear of expulsion.

He says it looks better and he
fails to see how proper dress and
polite speech interfere with educa-
tion. He also states more money
comes from alumni and friends if
we look pretty. I agree that it looks
better; I wear a suit-and-tie every
chance I get. Simply because we
agree on this doesn’t make either
one of us the Almighty Arbitrator
of good taste.

Secondly, if what the alumni and

Parietal rules elsewhere

By REEVE KELSEY

In the midst of the discussion con-
cerning parietal regulation at Wash-
ington and Lee, the Ring-tum Phi
decided to survey the parietal and
social regulations of several neigh-
boring schools and schools of simi-
lar nature. We received responses
from Yale University, the Univer-
sity of Virginia, Hollins College,
and Randolph-Macon Woman's Col-
lege. :

The University of Virginia pre-
sents perhaps the closest parallel
with W&L, having both dormitory
and fraternity living facilities. The
U.Va. regulations for the freshman
dorms are:

Hours:

Friday, 4:00 p.m.-3:00 a.m.
Saturday, 1:00 p.m.-3:00 a.m.
Sunday 1:00 p.m.-8:00 p.m.
Weekdays—No hours

The regulations for the fraternity
houses were changed this fall and
the regulations in effect now are:

Hours:

24 hours at the discretion of
of each house.

The enforcement provisions call for
the enforcement by the house officers
and the Interfraternity Council with
jurisdiction over the regulations in
the hands of the Interfraternity
Council. However, the regulations
also state, “Actual occupancy of a
room overnight by a member of the
Opposite sex is not permitted under
any circumstances. This is a viola-
tion of the Terms and Conditions
and applies to all housing areas oc-
cupied by single students,

Yale University presents similar
regulations for students living in the
dormitories. The regulations state:

Agnew-backer fires reply

By DOUG HAMILTON

Laurence Hilliard’s column in
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi criticiz-
ing Vice President Agnew exempli-
fied the point the Vice President
was trying to make in his much
debated T.V. news medium speech.
Agnew stated that the news media
has the power of selecting which
news stories appear before the pub-
lic, and thus exercise a great deal
of power over the minds of those
watching the news reports. He
wondered if the personal prejudices
of some of these newsmen weren't
reflected in which events they re-
port, and how much of that event
is to be shown to the viewer.

In his article. it was obvious that
Mr. Hilliard does not like Vice
President Agnew. He took several
of Agnew's “newsworthy” quotations
and presented them. The only prob-
lem was that in an effort to dis-
credit the Vice President, he took
Agnew's remarks out of context,
Stated Mr. Hilliard: “When Spiro
made his notorious remarks during
the campaign about ‘that fat Jap.’
and ‘if you've seen one slum, you've
seen them all people just laughed.”
In reference to “that fat Jap.” Agnew
said this on his private plane to a
good friend in much the same
manner as we might jokingly call

one of our friends, “a lazy hill-
billy.”

Mr. Agnew's actual complete
statement on slums was: “If you've

seen one slum, you've <cen them
all: each is as bad as the other.”
But the difference between Mr. Hil
liard’s form of “yellow” journalism
and the news we swe on TV. is
that one is found on an editorial
page. and the other is presented as
unbiased fact.

Another of the Vice President's
Matemenis that Mr. Hilliard dix
agreed with was that regarding tele
vision commeniating after President
ial speeches. Agnew felt that “the
people of this couniry have the right

to make up their own minds and
form their own opinion about a
Presidential address without having
the President's words and thoughts
characterized through the prejudices
of hostile critics before they can
even be digested.”

After Nixon's Viet Nam speech,
and after practically every “speech
the President has made, | have noted
an immediate rebuttal on the part
of the commentators: an instantan-
eous “anti” voice. And Mr. Hilliard
says, “Apparently the Vice Presideni
does not realize that the Federal
Communications Commission Fair-
ness Doctrine dictates that television
must give air time to all political
philosophies.” It appears to me that
the Vice President “apparently”
does realize this, when, like myself,
he sees only one sided commentary

There is also the question of how
much of the commentator’s opinions
are made up before the speech
they are remarking on is given. For
imstance, it was obvious that Averill
Harriman was sure of what he was
going to say beforehand. Mr. Harri
man has been a critic of Nixon's
Viet Nam policy since it began
So why. I ask Mr. Hilliard, do you
say the Vice President is “creatine
a pomonous air of McCarthyism in
the United States,” when all he seeks
is More objective and representative
ews reporting and commentating?

Or do Agnew’'s critics fear gov-
ernment censorship of the press? If
they have read his speech, they will
see that this is not the case. Said
the Vice President. “I am not ask
img for government censorship or
any other kind of censorship
This is one case where the people
must defend themselves. where the
cilizen——not governmenit—must be
the reformer. where the consumer
can be the most effective crusader’

fo avoid becoming paranoiac,
critics of the Vice President should
listen to his words. instead of listen
ing between them for

present in students’ rooms during the

10:00 a.m.-12 midnight: Friday and
Saturday—10:00 a.m.-2 a.m.

It is informative to note that the
superceded regulations at the Uni-
versity of Virginia allowed daily
visitation in the fraternity houses
from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m.

The visitation hours for Randoiph-
Macon are, needless to say, more
restricted than those of the former
two schools mentioned. The regula-
tions state: “Male guests will be al
lowed in the student dormitory
rooms from 1:00 p.m. until 9:00
p.m. on Saturday. The rules con-
cerning overnights in either Lexing-
ton or Charlottesville require the stu-
dent to “dismiss her date and be in
by 3:00 a.m. and not go out until
after 6:00 a.m.” The final regula-
tion in this section states that “Every
Randolph-Macon student is expected
to conduct herself in a manner
appropriate to the high standards of
the college. Any student whose be-
havior brings criticism upon herself
or the college will be subject to dis-
ciplinary action by Hall President's
Council and/or the Judiciary Com-
mittee.”

Hollins College does not allow

any visitation in the dormitory
rooms and the regulations concern-
ing visitation to Lexingion are: “Stu-
dents must be in by 3:00 a.m.
In determining where a student may
stay in these areas, she is to con-
sider the following two things: (1)
An agreement reached between the
student and her parents. (2) That
each student has an obligation io
maintain the reputation of the Col
lege.”

In summary, there is not too
much difference between the dormi
tory regulations of the two men’s
schools surveyed and those of Wash
ington and Lee, although the U.Va
fraternity regulations are consider
abl more relaxed from those of
WAL. Of the neighboring women’s
schools, both Randolph-Macon and
Hollins have similar rules

28 TO THE EDITOR

Another reply to Gilmore

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

While I agree with Mr. Gilmore,
39 (re: Friday Ring-tum Phi, No-
vember 21) in his advocation of the
speaking and dress traditions at
Washington and Lee, | regret that
an overzealous attitude has distorted
his perception. His final vision of
a vengeful alumni association rising
up to smite the University is some-
what disconcerting—and even fright-
ening if one stereotypes alumni as
Mr. Gilmore does students.

It is my “sophomoronish” opinion
that anyone who dares call W&L
“a school of slobs in 1969" deserves
to be strung up by his proverbial
necktie! I only pray that countless
friends of the University would
agree.

Agnew attacks
to include Phi?
It can happen!

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD
Columnist

Don't be surprised if Spiro T,
Agnew steps up to a podium in
Tallahassee, Fla. or Lincoln, Neb.
or some other hiding place of the
“Silent Majority” and commences to
denounce the Ring-tum Phi for print-
ing my column last week criticizing
the Vice President's denunciation of
television coverage.

The Washington Post and the New
York Times denounced the Vice
President editorially—and became
the targets of Agnew’s most recent
verbal outburst. Speaking before the
Alabama Chamber of Commerce in
Monigomery, Agnew criticized the
Washington Post Company as an
example of a trend toward mono-
polization and questioned the news
jtdgment of the New York Times.

Phe Vice President said “A single
company in the nation’s capital holds
control of the largest Newspaper in
Washington, D.C. and one of the
four major television stations, and
an all-news radio station, and one
of the three major news magazines

all grinding out the same editorial
line.”

To say that this represents a news
monopoly for the Washington Post
Company is ridiculous. There are
three daily newspapers, four tele-
vision stations, and thirty-seven
radio stations in Washington, D.C.
One of the other newspapers, the
Washington Star, also owns a tele-
vision station and two radio stations.
Why then did the Vice President
single out the Bost for criticism?
Because the Post has been critical
of the Nixon Administration. It's
part of Agnew’s attempts to silence
criticism.

According to the Vice President's
criteria, there are many other cities
in which one company holds a near
monopoly on news. Richmond News-
Papers, Inc.. for instance, owns both
newspapers and a radio station in
Virginia's capital. But since the edi-
torial pages of the Richmond news-
papers have become a propaganda
machine for the Nixon Administra-
tion, you will hear no criticism of
them from the Vice President.

Agnew also said “...f am not
recommending the dismemberment
of the Washington Post Company.”

But that is exactly the threat he
is fying to construe to the com-
pany. The Federal Communications

Commission has the power to lift
the company's license io WTOP-TV
and WTOP Radio, and Agnew wants
the company to realize that the new
Chairman of the FCC, arch-con
sefvative Dean Burch, is a Nixon
appointee
Besmirch the company’s repula
ton Before the public then hit it
with veiled threats-—that's the Vice
President's way of doing things

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Players of the Year

Football

By MIKE BERRY

On every football team in this
football-conscious country, there is
an individual who stands out above
all. That player is the team quarter-
back. He is the man who is booed
and cheered, the man who is prais-
ed and condemned. He has to be
a leader, a runner, a passer, a tactic-
ian, and a public relations agent. If
he fails at his job, the whole team
may find themselves wishing that
they had stayed in the locker room.
I think it is plain to see the value
of the quarterback; and this year
WAL was lucky enough to have a
fine quarterback in senior Chuck
Kuhn. Chuck’s value has been cited
by the coaches and Chuck, as a re-
sult, has been chosen the W&L
Player of the Year.

Chuck has proven himself to be
an inspirational and effective leader.
He moved a young W&L team to
several important and gratifying vic-
tories and nearly engineered a couple
of upsets. Chuck was as a constant
threat at quarterback because of his
ability to execute the pass-run op-
tion. His rollout tactics accounted for
1107 yards and 13 touchdowns. This
past season Chuck threw 163 times,
completing 71 for 924 yards and 10
touchdowns. He rushed for 183
yards more and carried the ball over
the golden stripe three times, These
figures were good enough to find
Chuck leading the CAC at season’s
end.

A man who knows enough about
football to be a considerable author-
ity, Coach Buck Leslie. revealed his
opinion of Kuhn very enthusiastic-
ally. “Chuck is an excellent com-
petitor. He has good leadership as
was shown by his successful calling
of plays. He possessed a ‘quick feel
of the opponents’ defense and could
play when he was hurt. I just wish
we had him back another year.”

Cross-country

By TOM ROWE

Junior Bill Wilkinson, running
competitively for the first time in
his life, has been chosen as_ the
fuesday Ring-tum Phi’s Runner of
the Year in cross country, Although
Wilkinson’s reaction to the news was
one of surprise, the award was well
deserved as he finished first for
W&L in the Generals’ last four
meets of the year.

Until this fall, Wilkinson was un-
tested in competition. He came out
for the team only at the urging
of his friend, team co-captain Paul
Wilbur. During the early part of
the season, Bob Sherwood paced the
Generals in their meets while Wilk-
inson developed his style and finish-
ed further back. However, his low-
est finish for W&L for the entire
season (and his career) was merely
fourth, He led the Generals for the
first time in the meet with Bridge-
water, and after that no General
could catch him.

This year figured to be a learn-
ing year for Wilkinson, so his suc-
cess was icing on the cake. The fact
that Wilkinson learned to run on
hills will help him next year even
more, since experience is important
on a mountain course. Although
Wilkinson hopes for the sake of the
team that he will have more chal-
lengers for first place on the team
next year, it would be quite an
achievement for him to win the
Player award again. He has the
ability and desire to do it,

Bill was a unanamous choice of
all those contacted on the cross-
country team. His improvement was
undoubtably his biggest strength this
fall. With a handful of first places
as a junior there seems to be no
limits on Bill's future as a senior.

Considering desire he exhibited
this season, next fall should be good.

Soccer

By JOHN ROBINSON

From the N.C.A.A. play-off soccer
team the Player of the Year is Carl

Hyatt. Coming from Huntington,
Long Island, Carl has been involved
in soccer most of his life. At W&L
he is a junior and a brother of
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity.

Playing left halfback Carl boomed
in five goals this fall, an unusually
high total for a man who plays
mid-field. Ever since his freshman
year he was in the starting line-up
for Washington and Lee. In that
freshman year he gained All-State
honors. Once again he is a candi-
date for All-State.

This season Carl has brought
needed stability in the middle of the
field where games are customarily
won or lost. A highly skilled ball-
handler, Hyatt has played in spite
of numerous injuries. Small but co-
ordinated, he has learned how to
read the field well. All these points
led the team to choose Carl Hyatt
as co-captain for next year

The highest praise of all for half-
back Hyatt came from his coach,
Joe Lyles. Lyles summed it up this
way: “As a junior Carl worked
tremendously hard on the practice
field and in games. His hustle has
always been excellent. Some of his
biggest improvements were learning
the game as tactician and increas-
ing his confidence. Cari Hyatt is
simply an outstanding person on and
off the field.”

A quiet boy, Carl Hyatt has done
his job well for three years now
with nary a complaint. His friendly
manner has made him a_ student
widely respected at Washington and
Lee. Next year Carl has hopes of
leading his team back to the
N.C.A.A,

Lacrosse Fall Practice
is success, states Szlasa

By JOHN ROBINSON

Last week was the beginning of
the 1970 lacrosse season. November
may seem a little out of season for
the stickmen, but W&L’s squad was
out in force for Fall Practice. The
week-long session saw a_ turn-out
of 44 boys of which 15 were fresh-
men hopefuls. On the final day a
scrimmage was fought out against
neighboring V.M.I.

Coach Szlasa was pleased by his
team especially on three points. His
starters have improved en masse
since last June. Many have been in
summer leagues or worked out on
their own. Also many of the players
from the jayvee team have shown
amazing promise. The last encour-
agement to Coach Szlasa was his
freshmen. Despite the fact some of
the better freshmen were in winter
sports, a troop of talented freshmen
impressed even the regulars.

Everyone agreed that the attitude
during the week was tremendous.
Competition for the starting spots
is exteremely keen. Some of the
older men were reacting well to
being pressured for their posts.

Ihe scheduling is nearly complete
for this spring. At present the op-
ponents number 11 but that figure
may be boosted to a dozen, Over
half the games will be at home as
contrasted to only a pair of home
stands last year. Some of the op-
ponents include: Duke, U.N.C.,
Washington College, Villanova, and
the University of Maryland of Balti-
more County. Pre-season scrimmages
will be slugged out with tough Penn-
sylvania and Yale.

Co-captains are Jay Meriweather
and Ned Coslett, each an outstand-
ing player and leader. With person-
nel like this the key word is im-
provement this spring at Wilson
Field.

Objective press is
subject for paper

A paper by a Washington and
Lee University professor urging the
world’s journalists to be more ques-
tioning and critical, when neces-
sary, of their nation’s policies and
institutions has been translated into
a Spanish language booklet in
Madrid.

The paper was written by Journ-
alism Prof. O. W. Riegel, retired
head of the Department of Journ-
alism and Communications at Wash-
ington and Lee.

Riegel originally delivered the
paper last year at a symposium on
“Mass Media and _ International
Understanding” held at Ljubljana,
Yugoslavia, The proceedings of the
conference were subsequently pub-
lished this year by the Department
of Journalism at the School of
Sociology, Political Science and
Journalism in Ljubljana,

In the paper, entitled “National-
ism and Communications,” Riegel
makes reference to “the generally
subordinate, parochial, and rein-
forcing role of the world’s public
media.”

“They are in every country the
supporters and servants of the na-
tional state, not its adversaries. They
follow rather than lead. They did
not invent the national state sys-
tem. They do not explain it or
challenge it. Day after day they
present a simplistic, ethnocentric
image of the world in which ‘we’
are the deserving center. The na-
tion’s idiosyncratic traditions and
values are the standards by which
the image of the world is presented
and judged,” Riegel said.

If Agnew doubts the prestige of
the Times, he only need consult
three opinion polls taken a few years
ago. In separate polls, 335 editors,
311 publishers, and 125 journalism
professors were asked to rank the
nation’s daily newspapers. In each
poll, the New York Times was
selected as the top newspaper. (The
Washington Post was among the top

rank the Times as the nation’s out-

in the habit of slanting the news?
Even an idiot should be able to
answer that question.

So don't be surprised when the

on the W&L campus. Maybe next
he'll threaten to take away my EOG.

“LT grant exceptions, although
these exceptions frequently turn out
to be, upon close inspection, more
apparent than real,” he added, “A
general principle is that the larger
the nation’s power, and the more
substantial the investments of the
public media, the more solicitous
the public media will be to preserve
national institutions, defend national
policies, support ‘law and order,’
and oppose change (‘rocking the
boat’). The greater the magnitude
of power and the larger the popula-
tion, the more dependent govern-
ments are upon psychological mani-
pulation to assure unity and order,
and the more dependent govern-
ments are upon the public media
to channel attention and win a con-
sensus of consent.”

In conclusion, Riegel wrote: “I
am asking professional journalists to
recognize their own professional
principles. I call upon journalists to
honor these principles in deed as
well as in rhetoric by telling the
truth, and not only part of the
truth but all of the truth.”

“Journalists may not be able to
initiate, change, or control the act-
ions of government and the conse-
quences of such actions, but they
have a professional duty to report
them. Men do not understand their
own environment and are helpless to
control it when the public media
fail to describe and illuminate the
mechanisms of political power and
the inner self-destructive compuls-
ions of the national power system.”
