nounced that the taproom at the
center will open at 5 p.m. today.

Tentative prices for beer at the
center are 20 cents per 12 ounce
draught and $0 cents for a 32 ounce
pitcher, Lane said, Since the center
is run on a non-profit basis, pricing
will be on a cost-plus-labor set-up,
he added,

Sandwiches — including subma-
rines, hoagies and pastrami — will
also be served, along with a variety
of soft drinks.

Lane announced earlier this week

Huntley Speaks on Bill

At Committee Hearing

President Huntley told the Senate
Finance Committee that the pro-
posed Tax Reform Act of 1969
would add significantly to the finan-
cial problems of privately-supported
colleges, churches, hospitals and
charities in testimony before the
committee last week.

Huntley delivered the _ official
statement of the Association of In-
dependent Colleges in Virginia, a
26-member organization protesting
certain provisions of the bill which
would end tax exemption for chari-
table deductions.

The reform bill was passed by the
House of Representatives Aug. 7 and
immediately drew strong protests
from private institutions which rely
heavily on volunteer giving.

Huntley labeled the bill as pres-
ently constituted “the first significant
step backward with respect to the
provisions for charitable contribu-
tions during the past 56 years of in-
come tax history.”

While admitting the need for tax
reform, Huntley told the Senate
Committee that the measure passed
by the House would “penalize legi-
timate private philantrohopy and
thus severely cripple private higher
education.”

He called the gains in tax re-
venue (estimated at $5 million in
1970) “negligible when compared
to the financial chaos that will re-

sult for churches, schools, hospitals
and innumerable public charities
that depend on gift support to con-
tinue their services.”

The attack on the segments of the
bill relating to tax exemption for
charitable donations was spearhead-
ed by the American Council on Edu-
cation, which presented testimony
from a panel of professors, univer-
sity presidents and tax lawyers at
the committee hearing.

Although no more appearances
before the committee are scheduled,
all the organizations involved will

be exerting pressure from behind the
scenes, according to Frank A. Par-
sons, assistant to the president.

Parsons said it is likely that many
colleges and universities will seek
aid in opposing the bill from friends
and influential alumni. Private hos-
pitals and churches can also be ex-
pected to play an important role, he
added.

Lobbyists from the American
Council on Education will also be at
work in the Senate in the attempt to
have the provisions of the bill op-
posed by private institutions cut out.

WLUR Adds Shows

The Beatles will highlight the in-
auguration of WLUR-FM’s_ third
year of broadcasting when the sta-
tion’s rock, top 40 and soul music
program, “Saturday's Child,” pre-
mieres the new Beatle’s album “Ab-
bey Road” tomorrow afternoon,

WLUR, the broadcasting service
of Washington and Lee University,
will be unveiling some big changes
in its Sunday programming and
several new shows, according to sta-
tion manager Phil Hubbard.

The Sunday broadcasting hours
have been converted to a regular
weekday evening format (5 p.m. to
11 p.m.) to be run by cadets from
the Virginia Military Institute.

Alumni Tour Campuses

Two alumni of Washington and
Lee University were among the 22
young Republican Congressmen who
made an unpublicized tour of 50
college and university campuses to
seek the root causes of student dis-
sent this summer.

One of the WAL alumni was the
man who conceived the idea for the
tour—Rep. William E. Brock, III,
of Tennessee. Brock, 38, a candy
manufacturer by profession, receiv-
ed the Bachelor of Science degree
from Washington and Lee in 1953.

Open at 5

The contest was originally begun
last spring and five names have al-
ready been chosen from about 30
entries. They are The Tap Room,
The Rathskeller, The Minkskeller,
The Red Rooster, and The Cockpit.
All new entries should be submitted
to the University Center Office by
noon Thursday.

Lane, a 1964 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee, was appointed to his
new position last spring. He holds
a Bachelor of Divinity degree from
New York's Union Theological
Seminary and spent the period from
1966 to 1968 working with the Fair-
fax County Public Welfare Depart-
ment,

Lane compiled an outstanding re
cord while an undergraduate at
WAL and was elected to Omicron
Delta Kappa leadership fraternity,

In his new capacity he will have
overall charge of the building and
will also consult with student com-
mittees to plan activities,

Sigma Delta Chi

Chooses Byrum

Reed Hyrum, a senior from
Wheeling, W.Va. was elected presi
dent of the Washington and Lee

chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, the na
tional professional journalism soc
iety, at an organizational meeting
this week

Phillip Hubbard, a senior from
Montevallo, Ala., was elected vice
president, Howard Herman, a senior
from West Hempstead, N.Y. was
elected secretary, and James Hughes
Jr, a senior from Richmond, was
re-elected treasurer

Hubbard was chosen to be the
chapter's delegate to the Sigma Delta
Chi Convention in San Diego, Cal
Nov, 15-18. Roy Carlton, a junior
from Syowet, N.Y., was chosen as
alternate delegate

The second W&L alumnus in the
group was Rep. G. William White-
hurst, 44, of Norfolk, a professor
and dean at Old Dominion College.
He received the Bachelor of Arts de-
gree from WAL in 1950, and also
holds the M. A. from the University
of Virginia and the Ph.D. from
West Virginia University.

The group reported 37 pages of
observations and recommendations
to President Richard M. Nixon fol-
lowing secret visits to the campuses
in May. One basic conclusion was
that the causes for student dissent
appeared to be much more deeply
rooted than the Congressmen had
expected,

The Congressmen found wide-
spread criticism from students who
felt unable to communicate with ad-
ministrators and faculty.

“In some cases, the university
structure itself seems at fault”, the
report stated. “In these instances the
modern university is so large, and
decision-making so fragmented, the
student often finds it difficult to

identify the individual or organiza-
tion that has the final responsibility
for a particular policy.

The group asked that Congress
not enact repressive legislation in
order to attempt to “control” camp-
us unrest. Instead, “the fundamental
responsibility for order and conduct
on the campus lies within the uni-
versity community,” the group con-
cluded.

The congressmen also recom-
mended lowering the voting age to
18, reforming the Selective Service
System, expansion of opportunities
for youths to participate in efforts
to overcome problems of society, es-
tablishment of a Presidential Com-
mission on Higher Education, and
improved communication between
governmental leaders and the camp-
us.

The summer issue of College and
University Journal, which features
the Brock tour said Brock realized
he “had no real understanding of
what was happening on the nation’s
campuses” before the tour,

A new show also figures in the
Sunday changes for the school radio,
which officially began broadcasting
this year at 5 p.m. Wednesday. “The
Church Today” will make its debut
Sunday as a 30-minute program of-
fering commentary on the contem-
porary religious institution in
America.

New music shows on WLUR in
clude “International Concert Hour,”
featuring music from five foreign
countries, and “Concert Classics,”
presenting an hour of uninterrupted
classical entertainment.

An educational station should of-
fer its audience several hours of
public affairs programming each
week, Hubbard said, and he feels
WLUR has scheduled some of its
best material in this category for
the coming year.

Along with returning programs
such as “Point-Counterpoint,” “The
Space Story” and “Conversations at
Chicago” come new programs like
“Ask the Professor,” “The Written
Word” and “The Living Law.” Also
new this fall is “Sports Contact,” a
15 minute show which will cover
the local sports scene in an exclu-
sive interview format.

Another show returning to WLUR
is “Fives, Sixes, and Sevens,” a two-
hour show of easy listening enter-
tainment which made its debut on
WLUR last winter “Niteline,” the
“anything goes show,” will be back
in an earlier 7:30 p.m. time slot,

WLUR will continue its policy
of broadcasting all special campus
events, the remaining away football
games and most of the away basket-
ball games this fall, Hubbard said.

A special documentary on the
floods in the local area also has
been planned for the near future.

There will also be special programm-

ing for Nov. 4 to cover the general
election, Hubbard stated.

WLUR broadcasts at 91.5 and is
operated by the Department of
Journalism and Communications of
Washington and Lee University.

 

The old railroad bridge near East Lexington just before the Goshen Road turnoll shows a small part of
the damage that was a result of the area's August flood, The University donated $5,000 to aid in flood

relief efforts.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-trum Phi
Friday

Friday, September 26, 1969

A Statement of Policy

The functions of a student newspaper
are threefold: (1) to keep the campus com-

munity informed about matters that concern
it; (2) to stimulate discussion on those mat-
ters and (3) to serve as a forum for such
discussion.

Regarding the purely reportoral aspect,
it is the overall aim of the Friday Ring-tum
Phi to maintain the highest degree of accur-
acy and integrity. A major tenet of past
Ring-tum Phi policy has been to restrict news
coverage to events that originate at Wash-
ington and Lee. While our intention this year
is not to supplant the function of the com-
mercial dailies in reporting news occurring
outside the confines of the campus, we do
feel it is a fallacy to assume that the academic
community does not feel the effects, and
should not be aware, of occurrences which
also have a more widespread significance.
Such an arbitrary restriction of scope is also
in the educational sense a disservice in that it
fosters a parochialism which all schools
should seek to overcome. Yet when we do
choose to print news of local, national, or in-
ternational import we will strive, not to parrot
the dailies, but to emphasize the aspects of
greatest significance to the academic com-
munity.

The chief purpose of our editorials will
be to encourage a discussion of the issues
which confront the campus community,
whether directly or indirectly. Controversy is
an unavoidable part of newspaper work, and
forcefully defending the positions we adopt
is a responsibiilty we accept. Yet we shall not
seek to differ, from the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi or from others, merely for the sake of
dissent, and all debates conducted by this
paper will be for the purpose of clarifying

the issues with facts, not obscuring them with
rhetoric. We recognize no subject too sacred
for public scrutiny and comment, but we
realize the consequences of acting irrespon-
sibly in such matters.

The remainder of the editorial page will
be devoted to columns of comments, letters,
and features and articles based on research
into the problems which face W&L. We feel
that in past years many of the cultural op-
portunities this community provides have
been neglected. We intend to rectify this
lack of coverage by providing more reviews
and commentary on these events.

Departing from the carte blanche policy
the Ring-tum Phi has previously extended to
all letters to the editor, we reserve the right to
reject any letter if it contains scurrilous or
irresponsible allegations which could do ir-
reparable harm to innocent parties and pos-
sibly result in legal action against the author.
Our intention is not to silence anyone—we
encourage comment from our readers—or
slight a valid argument, but merely to main-
tain our own integrity by avoiding a sensa-
tionalistic approach. All letters considered
for publication must be signed, but the
author’s name will be withheld at the author’s
request and the editor’s concurrence.

It is extremely easy for a newspaper staff
to measure its own performance in mechani-
cal terms—meet deadlines and smooth inter-
nal operations—and we are not immune to
such pitfalls. In proper perspective we realize
that such matters are only a necessary pre-
condition, and if we become remiss in our
primary responsibilities of reporting, com-
menting and serving as a forum we expect
our readers to reorient us, for it is only by
such reaction that a dialogue can be main-

tained.

Coming and Going

The remarks at right, from two speeches
given here not too far apart historically,
evoke from us some observations which need
to be made before the academic year is any
further advanced.

The frightening condemnation in the
valedictory speech, by someone who was a
great success here according to standards the
University accepts as valid, is that the educa-
tion the speaker acquired was somehow be-
side the point, at least until nearly all his
time here had expired. The final awareness
the gentleman describes offers some en-
couragement, but there remain unanswered
questions.

Why should someone who has evidently
acquired a good deal of knowledge consider
it irrelevant? Must we accept the condition
he describes as a fact of life here?

A significant part of the answer to the
first question lies in the reprinted excerpt
from President Huntley's recent speech. It
may be a cliche to say that a student will re-
ceive from an institution only to the extent
and quality of his contribution to it, but it is
nonetheless true.

We suspect that most of those who con-
sider work here essentially irrelevant or dull
are engaged in the quest for academic honors
rather than knowledge; or they are following
a course of study pursued because it will
prove “valuable,” i.e. lucrative, in one’s ca-
reer and not because of any inherent interest
the student has for it.

Yet just as the gentleman himself offers
the University credit for finally getting across
to him the point of a liberal education, we
will be the first to admit there are deficiencies
and false emphases in the atmosphere the
University provides. That much being the
case, the time to point them out is not at a
valedictory speech, but while one is still an
active member of the academic community,
A liberal education should be stimulating,
enlightening and enjoyable. If it is not, one
should not wait until it is too late to demand
that it become so, nor ought the demand to
be directed entirely to the University, but

also to oneself.

Freshman Camp Remarks . . .

“You, as Washington and Lee students, must not
expect the University to do for you. It is you, the stu-
dents, that must take what it offers, bringing more to
it so that you individually will take away more.”

... And a Valedictory Address

About ten days ago | was studying in that building
up there. It was a warm, late spring Saturday evening.
From the room I was in, | had already heard the voices
of one or two couples—the exam remnants of WAL
weekends. Such an atmosphere never makes for good
studying, but around 9:30, as the last light was disap-
pearing. | seared myself. Not only was | concentrating
well, | was enjoying it. This is an admission bordering
on heresy, but it made the necessary activities of thai
night more bearable. It set me to thinking, too. Why
couldn't it have all been fun?

It seems to me an education should develop the
human being in man. Sort of reluctantly, culminating
in a revelation on a beautiful May evening. I decided
that a man should think. That he can enjoy thoughts
for their own sake and explore every little cranny of
this hill we have here, with pleasure. Only in this way
can a student find himself. I place a high value on
knowing me.

| can remember talking with friends, arguing with
conviction that learning was painful, and that a lot
of what didn't hurt was drudgery. | don't mean that
the whole learning process here has been a bore. Some
courses have been glittering successes, but Washington
and Lee has failed me. Because | can see similar re-
actions of resignation to, scorn for, or detachment from
the academic role of the university, I think it has failed
the class of °69.

Why? I have the highest respect for the ideals of
Washington and Lee. The expressed desire and po-
tential are here to offer a significant education, com-
plete with student-professor contact and policies which
keep in mind the goal of a liberally educated man. Our
athletic program could be, and, in part, is—a striking
complement to this goal. Even some of our traditions,
if they could be brought to life, might be valuable.
That no relevance was given them, and that they are
dead, is another sign of a good idea gone wrong.

So this is commencement, and I'l! be glad to leave,
and to begin, | hope, for | have a vision of what a man
might be if he tries hard enough and I know the atmos-
phere here makes stich achievement just about im-
possible. But to stop and think #bout it, I didn't have
a gimmer of what I thimk | can see now when | came
here. The promise is so exciting that I have to ask how
it got inside me. The only logical answer can be that
Washington and Lee is the reason for its presence.

So maybe I should use the reflection I have boasted
wbout—tight mow. At present, I'm disappointed in
Washington and Lee because of the promises it wasn't
able to keep. But it has shown me what the promises
might be, and has left me aching to get on with the job
of fulfilling it. W and L has made me more aware—
and thats a significant contribution. Maybe it is all the
more noble by not pretending to be a complete, a
final, or even 4 satisfactory answer, So, at my leaving,
at what | really think will prove to be a beginning, I'm
half mad at all those white columns, but half awed by
the gift of those brick walis.

Letters to the Editor...

To the Editor:

“The Tuesday Edition” editorial
in the first issue of the Ring-tum
Phi represents a deficiency that per-
vades Washington and Lee:

“For our part, we will endeavor
to bring to light student opinion on
all issues and from all angles.”
Nifty. Why then did the first page
depict some highly significant events
and personal statements and action,
but the editorial page examine only
one relatively unessential question,
Swim-In °70, and even then not arti-
culate the implications. This is, to
me, uninvolved and unaware, in
much greater than a merely jour-
nalistic sense.

1. Look, for instance, at the ar-
ticle “EC supports counselors’ con-
ventional dress stand”. Please don’t
groan, I will be brief and concise as
possible. I am not quibbling in the
hackneyed manner of protest about
this. I actually don’t care whether
anyone does or does not wear a
coat and tie. | only wish that you
consider the nature of this question.
First of all what exactly is meant
in the wording of the resolution sup-
porting the dormitory counselors by
“encouraging” freshmen to wear con-
ventional dress? Since it is manda-
tory for freshmen to pay a cafeteria
fee with their tuition, what right do
the dormitory counselors have in
ordering, as they have in the past,
an “improperly” attired student from
the dining hall? Furthermore, what
benefit to our academic community
(isn’t that what we're supposed to
be?) do the members of the EC
recognize in conventional dress?
(The recent administrative fund
drives makes the commercial aspect
obvious but not necessarily relevant
here.)
Please, I really don’t understand
this myself. And before you respond
to those questions, tell me:
a) What is “conventional” dress?
b) What specific presuppositions
are involved in looking
“good?”

¢) How is it possible for a person
who cares how he appears to
be insensitive, and unappeal-
ing in his words and actions?

d) Then how should we try best

to appear? What standards
should we use and what values
are proper?

Right about now a curious phe-
nomenon is occuring in some cir-
cles of minds here in Lexington. It
has perplexed me since my fresh-
man year. It is the ignorant and
slightly fearful reaction against earn-
est questions or attempts like the
preceding. It is the general agree-
ment within a group for a group
mentality) to dismiss something as
gauche and therefore not have to
consider it. A clear example of what
I mean is the nickname “Ballsnatch-
ers” given to the Bandersnatch din-
ner-discussion meeting by some of
the more atheletic fraternity com-
radery. It betrays an ignorance of
the literary allusion and what's
more, a “latent” value structure.

It is this attitude of complacent
or negligent insensitivity in the social
and academic aspects of WAL I am
pointing out. This contradiction of
declared intention or policy and ac-

Pinter’s “Silent”
Play Auditions
Next Week

“Harold Pinter is definitely a mo-
dern playwright, but | don't know
how you would classify him. He's
not absurd... .” If anything, ac-
cording to Professor Lee Kahn,
Pinter is silent.

In the first Troub production for
the year, The Homecoming, silences
and long pauses play an important
part in conveying what Kahn calls
“Pinter's concern for the umveiced
mental processes that people under-
go.” Pauses and silent punctuation
become almost unreal in what
seems to be a very real house in
London. In this house, Pinter puts
six characters who are as Kahn puts
iH, “Sterile, frustrated people leading
sterile, frustrated lives.” By the end
of the play. these “sterile, frustrated
people” become almost grotesque be-
cause of the pauses and black com-
edy that Pinter has worked into the
achion.

Production dates for the play are
set for the end of October, and try-
outs for the play will be on Monday
and Tuesday of next week. There
will be an afternoon and an evening
session each day from 4:00 to 5:00
and from 7:00 to 9:00. Mr. Kahn
urges all those interested in trying
out for the play or workine back-
silage on seis or lights to be af the
theatre during these tryout periods.

Although Kahn feels that The
Homecoming is an cxciting work, ne
hastened to add that “unfortunately.
everyone keeps their clothes on
throughout the entire play.” Since
there are five male paris and only
one female part, he fell that if
wouldn't disappoint too many su-
denis.

tual commitment is evident in’ the
editorial page. I guess | am angry
because I first noticed this in myself.

2. It is also obvious in the passive
acceptance of the EC appointment
of the entire Assimilation Committee
to the duties of directing the student
center. Of the twelve committee
members, nine are from below the
Mason-Dixon line, and eleven are in
fraternities. However besides the
question of distribution and bids,
what qualifications or interest do
they have?

3. Consider the IFC article. What
reasons were given for reinstating
the three hour long work periods a
week for freshmen fraternity
pledges—work periods which were
formerly outlawed after faculty re-
commendation? Why are they paint-
ing things and raking leaves again
this year?

Besides the motion for each fra-
ternity to contribute $100 toward
the project to build a municipal
pool, what other programs relating
to the Lexington community are be-
ing considered? Is there any pro-
posed action to aid flood-victims, the

difficulties of the new Boys Club,
or the poverty stricken in the county
or any organization assisting them?

In other words, exactly in what
ways are fraternities conscientiously
relating to Lexington or the “aca-
demic community”?

4. Is “diversity” a geographic
thing?

5. Lastly, I might suggest that
President Huntley “contemplate”

the value of his first compulsory
University assembly address,

I hope by now you see what I
mean. I am not against conventional
dress, the Student Center Commit-
tee, or the IFC, or the Ring-tum Phi.
I am against the contradictory and
unreflective manner prevailing in
our social and academic community
(that is, in ourselves) and the hor-
rifying waste of potential,

Not only is a new kind of involve-
ment needed but also greater clarity
on what an education ought to be.

I have no neat universal answers,

Student Center Features
Concerts, “Bandersnatch”

“Bandersnatch”, a new dinner and
discussion group composed of in-
terested members of the student
body and faculty, met for the first
time Wednesday night in the dining
room adjoining the Commons and
University Center.

The idea behind “Bandersnatch”
is to promote closer student-faculty
relations and to take advantage of
intellectual resources untapped in the
normal course of University life, ac-
cording to its two main promoters,
C. Turner and Pleas Geyer, who
hope to run the program on a regu-
lar basis.

Last Wednesday, Professor Henry
Sloss of the English Department
opened the program with a reading
of his own works written during his
graduate work at the University of
Virginia. In an atmosphere not nor-
mally found in a classroom, some
forty present spent several hours in
general discussion and commenting
on Sloss’ works.

Turner and Geyer are currently
soliciting ideas for similar dinner
meetings, but are hoping that the
program will be self-sustaining and
not require recognized leadership.

“Bandersnatch” is one of seevral
events that have already taken place
at the new University Center. In the
past two weeks, two concerts, one
folk and one folk-rock have been
held in the yet unnamed tap room,
each to an audience of over 200,
Talent for the concerts came from
both Washington and Lee and Hol-
lins College. The first concert was
held September 13, during Rush

Week and the other last Sunday.
Again produced by Turner and Gey-
er, advance publicity was at a mini-
mum.

Mr. Ken Lane, director of the
University Center, has been ap-
proached by several groups, notably
Turner and Geyer, concerning the
possible location of a coffeehouse
within the center. One of the present
meeting-dining rooms between the
Commons and the Center has receiv-
ed tentative approval by the admini-
stration and funds from various Uni-
versity organizations are currently
being sought to complete the room’s
furnishings.

Turner hopes that such a location
would provide an outlet for talent,
particularly in the fields of music
and poetry, on a regular rather im-
promptu basis.

The coffeehouse is but one of
several ideas that Mr. Lane and the
Assimilation Committee are con-
sidering, and several are finalized.
In addition to the recognized activi-
ties (the game room, tap room, and
the like), the center will be utilized
for a Coffeehouse Service of Wor-
ship, consisting of an informal serv-
ice and liturgy, planned for Par-
ents’ Weekend, and coffees, allowing
students to meet with profesors on
an informal basis.

The center maintains facilities for
practically any extra-curricular acti-
vity at Washington and Lee. Mr.
Kane is open to suggestions by prac-
tically any student and/or faculty
groups as to ways to utilize the cen-
ter.

vinced of that than ever. W&L just
barely edged Towson State College,
14-13, last Saturday.

“This is a very inexperienced team
in many areas, particularly on de-
fense and at many back-up positions
on offense,” Coach Leslie observed.

“It is the most inexperienced team
I've been associated with in my 10
years at W&L.”

The General head coach added
that “this will necessitate using fresh-
men more—and using more fresh-
men—than we had originally anti-
cipated.”

Although he was unhappy about
several aspects of Saturday’s game,
Leslie was pleased, naturally, that
the Generals emerged victorious. Ii
was the first time W&L has won an
opening game since 1963, and it
came on the road for a team with
the reputation of winning at home
but losing away.

“I’m real happy with the way our
boys came back to win it,” Leslie
said. W&L trailed Towson, 13-7,
after three quarters, but marched
80 yards for the winning touchdown
with eight minutes left, then held off
repeated Towson efforts to salvage
the victory.

ODK Closes

spring.
Omicron Delta Kappa, a national
honorary leadership _ fraternity

founded at Washington and Lee in
1914, was the leading such organiza-
tion at Vanderbilt, according to the
Delta Review, a monthly magazine
published in Mississippi.

Explaining the move, Acting Presi-
dent Pace VanDevender of Jackson,
Miss., was quoted in the review as
saying the members of the frater-
nity have been “earnestly attempting
to justify the society's existence and
have been unable to do so.”

VanDevender said the reasons for
closing the ODK chapter “stem from
the nature of the present student
leader, as compared to that of stu-
dent leaders of Vanderbilt's past.

“When these men were of like at-
titudes and were motivated partially
by the prestige and status of being
known as a leader, the honor of
ODK membership was welcome and
perhaps useful to its members.

“Today, the student leaders are
more diverse in their ideas and poli-
tical stances, and are motivated by
the idea of contributing to the uni-
versity and to its students, rather
than by the status that leadership
may bring.”

VanDevender said another factor
in the decision was the danger “of
excluding the more individualistic
leaders” because of the subjective
form of membership selection.

touchdowns; punter and linebacker
Ken Carter; guard Staman Ogilvie,
tackle Tom McJunkin, end Steve
Mahaffey and defensive back Dave
Brooks. He also cited linebacker
Dean Kumpuris, who led the team
in tackles; fullback Doug Gossmann,
freshman center Bim Glasgow, and
kicking specialist Jack  Baizley,
whose two perfect placements pro-
vided the victory margin.

If Leslie and the Generals didn’t
know exactly what to expect from
Towson, they do know what this
week’s opponent, Randolph-Macon,
has in store for them.

“Being out-personneled in spots
by Towson was somewhat of a sur-
prise, although not a complete one,”
Leslie commented, “But we KNOW
we are going to be out-personneled
by Randolph-Macon.”

The Generals entertain the Yellow
Jackets Saturday in their home open-
er at Wilson Field, with the kickoff
at 2 p.m. W&L hopes to avenge last
year’s 45-21 loss at Ashland,

“We know they will put a lot of
pressure on our defense,” Coach Les-
hie said, “That Howard Stevens puts
a lot of pressure on anybody's de-
fense.”

The key to any Generals’ success
probably will be in stopping Stevens.
He ran wild last year against W&L
en route to piling up 1,468 yards
rusing and 142 points for the sea-
son, both tops among the nation’s
small colleges.

Injurywise, the Generals fared
okay last Saturday—with one excep-
tion. Starting guard Ned Coslett was
lost for the season with a knee in-
jury which required surgery.
