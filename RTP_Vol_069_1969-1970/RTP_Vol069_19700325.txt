Ollinger
Crenshaw

1905-1970

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw, pro-
fessor of history at Washington
and Lee and official University
historian, died at home early
Thursday morning. He was sixty-
five years old.

A native of College Park, Ga.,
Dr. Crenshaw came to W&L as
a student in 1922, launching a
48 year affiliation with the Uni-
versity. He received his A.B. de-
gree in 1925, and his M.A. in
1926, both from Washington and
Lee. He then joined the history
department as an instructor,

Dr. Crenshaw received his
doctorate at Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity in 1945, On leave from
WAL in the 1956-57 academic
year, he held the Ernest J. King
Chair of Maritime History at the
United States Naval War Col-
lege in Newport, R.1.

In 1947, he was named a full
professor of history at Washing-
ton and Lee, and in 1962, he
was appointed head of the his-
tory department. He — stepped
down as department head upon
reaching 65 last year, but he cori-
tinued active teaching.

For twenty years, Dr. Cren-
shaw meticulously researched
the history of Washington and
Lee in preparation of General
Lee’s College. His book won
broad critical acclaim as a sefi-
ous history of the institution, and
also a wilty one.

Robert Mottley, book editor
of the Roanoke World-News,
wrote of Dr. Crenshaw’s book:
“The bulk of Crenshaw’s writ-
ing is both measured and humor-
ous. His points are made clearly,
and then sunk home with a wry
turn of phrase. Throughout,
there is the sparkling ebullience
of a literate man writing about
something he loves.”

Dr. Crenshaw’s major fields of
research were the history of
American higher education, the

Old South, and the Civil War.
He was author of The Slave

States in the Presidential Elec-
tion of 1860, published by the
Johns Hopkins Press, and articles
for several historical journals, in-
cluding the American Historical
Review, The Journal of Southern
History, and others.

He was a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, Phi Gamma Delta,
American Historical Association,
Mississippi Valley Historical As-
sociation, Texas Historical As-
sociation, and Social Sciences
Association. From 1953 to 1955
he was a member of the execu
tive council of the Southern His-
torical Association,

Dr. Crenshaw is survived by
his wife, Mrs. Marjorie Burford
Crenshaw of Lexington, and his
son, Albert B. Crenshaw, a re
porter for the Washington Daily
News.

A graveside funeral service
was conducted on Saturday after
noon at the Stonewall Jackson
Memorial Cemetery by the Rev
D. Holmes Irving, Jr., rector of

SAC Broadens Law Parietals

By John Robinson

Last Wednesday the Student Af-
fairs Committee discussed three pro
posals dealing with an alteration of
the law students’ dormitory parie
tals, the Interfraternity Council's de-
ferred rush plan for next year, and
the IFC’s motion to abolish house-
mothers.

Liberalization of parietals in the
law dorms was recommended by
Dean Roy L. Steinheimer of the
Law School and passed by the SAC.
The major changes include the
dropping of the 3 a.m. curfew for
visitation Friday and Saturday; how-
ever overnight visitation will not be
allowed.

The weekend limitations on girls
in the law dorms remain in effect
Visitation will only be allowed from
Friday afternoon until midnight
Sunday .

In addition there will be no ap
pointed law school dormitory coun
selors next fall. Each section will
elect necessary representatives to
take their place.

According to Dean Lewis G
John, these proposals were accept
ed because of the increased matur

ity of the graduate student. He saw

little need at present for the re-
quired dormitory counselors in gra
duate school dorms.

Commenting on the IFC's defer-
red rush plan, Dean John said, “We
considered the plan in some detail,
and then decided to defer any fur
ther action until the next meeting

in April when IFC representatives
can be present.
“There were two basic areas of

debate—the ground rules for rush-
ing and the basic procedure of rush
dates. Ground rules will be deter
mined by the IFC, but the SAC will
finally approve these basic rules.
“But perhaps the biggest issue in
their proposal is the amount of con

tact between rushees and frater-
nity men.”

The IFC proposal to abolish
housemothers was defeated in the
SAC meeting on the grounds that
housemothers do serve a basic func
tion. The committee noted that
housemothers insure continuous
Operations of each fraternity and

encourage a “degree of civility.”
The committee commented
that no alternatives to housemothers
were pul forth by IFC. Some
alternatives mentioned were the em

THE RING-TUM PHI :

Washington and Lee has been
presented a gift valued at approxi-
mately $102,000 by Mrs. Cornelia
C. Gooch of Richmond, Virginia.

The gift, a bequest of the late
Mr. Claiborne W. Gooch, Jr., of
Richmond in which Mrs. Gooch re-
tained a life interest, was released
by Mrs. Gooch for immediate use
by the university.

The gift will be used to establish
the Claiborne W. Gooch, Jr. Schol-
arships in memory of the late Mr.
Gooch, a 1915 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee, President Huntley
announced today,

The scholarships are to be award-
ed to financially-needy and deserv-
ing students, with preference given
to candidates from the Boys’ Home
in Covington, Va. and the Rich-
mond Home for Boys in Richmond,
Va. The fund further specifies that
recipients are to be persons of
“strong character and educational
motivation” who need financial as-
sistance in order to attend the uni-
versity.

The fund will be part of W&L’s
“Honor Scholarship” program, in
which aid is awarded in recognition
of outstanding academic achieve-
ment. In addition, as part of the
overall program of student financial
aid at Washington and Lee, totaling
more than $500,000 this year, finan-
cial assistance is made available to
all students who qualify for admis-
sion to W&L and who need aid to
enroll,

Holton to Speak for ODK,
Assembly Set for April 14

Virginia Governor Linwood Hol-

ton will speak in Lee Chapel at
noon on April 14 as part of the
annual “tap day” ceremonies of

Omicron Delta Kappa, a national
leadership fraternity.

Holton is the first Republican to
be elected Governor of Virginia
1869, and is also the first
Washington and Lee alumnus to win
the office since William M. Tuck
was elected in 1945,

A close personal friend of Presi-
dent Nixon, Gov. Holton was in-
strumental in arranging for Nixon
to address the annual Omicron Del-
ta Kappa convocation at WA&L in
January, 1968, just before Mr

Grant of $102,000
Given to Scholarships

“This gift presented by Mrs.
Gooch is greatly appreciated,”
President Huntley noted. “It comes
at a time when additions to financial
aid programs are needed badly by
institutions of higher learning. This
generous gift is especially important
because it represents one of the
largest additions to our financial as-
sistance program in recent years. It
is also of great significance because
it establishes at Washington and Lee
an entirely new scholarship fund.”

 

ABSENCE
REGULATIONS

Spring holidays begin upon
conclusion of classes on Friday,
March 27. Classes resume on
Monday, April 6.

Each student is expected to
make transportation arrange-
ments which will assure that he
is back in Lexington to attend his
first class.

Absences for all students (in-
cluding juniors and seniors) be-
fore and after the holidays are
limited to students on the Dean’s
List, to those on the semester
and midsemester Honor Rolls,
and to seniors in their last se-
mester who are applicants for
degrees, if they do not need
more than fifteen semester hours
and thirty grade points to be gra-
duated, and if they have a cumu-
lative grade-point ratio of at
least 2.00 and a grade-point ratio
of at least 2.00 on the work of
the preceding semester.

According to University regu-
lations a student taking an un-
authorized absence from his
classes or laboratory periods on
the last day of his classes pre-
ceding or the first day of his
classes following spring vacation
“thereby severs his connection
with the University”. Reinstate-
ment may be made only on con-
ditions to be determined by the
Absence Committee.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, March 25, 1970

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw was a man of another time—a
time when “uptight” was not a jargon word that aptly match-
ed our national and inner conditions; a time when gracious-
ness, gentility, and just plain good manners rated higher on
the value scale than garishness and “doing your own thing.”

He was of the Old South.

The death of Dr. Crenshaw has ended an
era at Washington and Lee. For the past 48
years, Dr. Crenshaw studied, worked and
lived in the college community. Throughout
those years he earned a reputation as an ex-
cellent teacher and as a warm and friendly
person.

Very few of us can fail to remember the
tall, slightly bent gentleman walking down
the colonnade into Washington Hall. Few
have failed to hear stories about his unique
teaching habits. Yet only a few were for-
tunate to study under him.

His dedication to this school must also
be mentioned. He studied here as an under-
graduate and returned to teach history and
coach tennis. As time passed he became as

Off The Horns

The Dance Board is the student body’s
favorite whipping boy. While the Dance
Board has made overtures to the student
body in conscientious efforts to raise itself
from this critical mire, it has been unsuccess-
ful.

The Dance Board has found itself in the
unenviable predicament of trying to please
all the students all the time. The various
specialized brands of “music” offered by the
current breeds of entertainers are, however,
frequently exclusive in their particular ap-
peal. To supply as much variety as possible,
the Dance Board has in the past year divided
their program from four into six parts. Since
these attempts to please the students have
been futile, we question the wisdom of this
partition.

The entertainment scheduled this year
by this little group has been more varied.
The quality, however, has too obviously been
sacrificed. We are certain that this is due to
lack of revenue. The Dance Board has an
operating budget of about $40,000 this year;
therefore, we doubt the financial capability
of the Dance Board to bring quality per-
formers here even four times a year, not to
mention six.

Rather than continuing the expanded
program in number of University weekends,

much of an institution as the college itself,
bending with the winds of change. Both
names were often mentioned in the same

breath.

His dedication is borne out in General
Lee’s College, the only monolithic study of
this school. This work is historically accurate
and extremely amusing. It remains a monu-
ment to the institution and the man,

There will be no more “jotters” or legal
pads, and you won’t see students worrying
whether the eight books on the reading list
will be on the exam, or scrambling for front
row seats in Washington 33; for an era has
ended. It will never be forgotten.

B. Waugh Crigler

Of A Dilemma

we suggest that perhaps a curtailment to two
featuring quality groups would be more
palatable to the student body. Variety has
proven itself no worthy substitute for quality,
and apparently the Dance Board cannot of-
fer both.

The Dance Board has also been vigor-
ously assailed for their perennial failure on
the grounds that they are a self-perpetuat-
ing, out of touch clique. In a move designed
to end this line of criticism, the Executive
Committee recently extended a helping hand
to the dilemma-plagued Dance Board. The
prescription the E.C. suggested was to have
the Dance Board’s vice-president chosen in
a school-wide election. We propose, how-
ever, a more effective and efficient means of
remedying the ills of the Dance Board —
abolish it.

Although this may seem a radical solu-
tion, it is in fact realistic. If the ultimate goal
is to have a group responsible to student
sentiment, then the only method is to have a
committee chosen by the students. There-
fore, we feel the elected representatives of the
students—the Executive Committee—should
select the members of a Dance Committee
similar in status to the other standing com-
mittees.

&.  Y.

A Right To Choose

The Student Affairs Committee’s rejec-
tion of the IFC resolution to abolish the rule
requiring housemothers was, we think, too
routine a dismissal, especially in the light of
the current financial difficulties many houses
are facing.

It is true that the hastily-drafted resolu-
tion did not offer any alternative, but we are
not sure one is necessary. Nor did it deal with
the problem of those houses whose leases
require housemothers, but that problem
could be settled through the Board of Trus-
tees.

Further, the IFC had little basis for ap-
pealing for justification to the tendency
away from in loco parentis structures, since
housemothers are anything but rule en-
forcers anyway and can be fired by the
fraternity if they try to be. Ir is, of course,
an example of the in loco parentis for the
university to require housemothers, but as
we understand it, that’s not the way the
issue was presented.

The truth the resolution contained is
that housemothers are an unjustifiable ex-
pense for the many houses now operating
on drastically constricted budgets. Moreover,
many housemothers who are resigning after
this year—there are several—feel they are
contributing nothing to the community on
the one hand and that their jobs are inse-
cure at best, on the other. That judgment is,
we think, substantially correct, and we fore-
see a great deal of difficulty in acquiring re-
placements.

The SCA contended, besides the objec-
tion based on a lack of alternative solutions,
that housemothers provide for continuous

operation and encourage a “degree of civil-
ity.”

That assertion seems unrealistic. First, many
houses pay members to oversee help and
plan the budget, and those that don’t, could.
As a matter of fact, this solution might help
fraternities subsidize potential members for
whom expenses are at present prohibitive.
As for the notion that housemothers encour-
age civility, it has been our observation that
those people who tend to be uncivil will be
so in spite of, and sometimes because of, the
presence of a housemother.

Finally, we cannot see the need for any
alternatives at all, though from the stand-
point of maintaining some intellectual at-
mosphere a substitute may be desirable. Fra-
ternity houses, minus the housemothers and
with the upperclass officers who are sup-
posed to live there, have more per capita up-
perclass supervision than do the freshman
dorms, and they have the advantages of be-
ing inhabited by students a year older and
presumably at least that much more mature,
and of members who have more common in-
terests and generally more consideration
than those students thrown together at ran-
dom in a dorm section.

It is true that many housemothers, most-
ly those who have been here for several years,
are an integral part both of the community
and of their respective houses, and we cer-
tainly don’t mean to suggest that they should
be removed. However, most of the house-
mothers here are not so integral, and we be-
lieve the fraternities should have the right
to choose.

Debate on the Admissions Report

Letters to the Editor

Rational discussion—of amy seri-
ous issue — is singularly difficult
and unrewarding in the academic
world, where passions run high and
ideology reigns unhindered among
the far from serene and judicious
professional wisemen in the halls of
ivy. And so one embarks hesitantly
and pessimistically upon any pre-
sentation of his views of the readers
of this journal. Still, two of last
Wednesday's features in the “Ring-
tum Phi” were so remarkably fool-
ish as to demand prompt reply and
rebuttal; and to offer these is as
much a duty as a pleasure. Both
pieces concerned propsed changes in
admissions goals and standards; it
will be recalled that the first was an
article by the two co-chairmen of
the EC’s admissions committee and
that the other was a letter to the
editor. Each seemed more absurd
than the other and I should prefer
merely to call attention to their hav-
ing been published together rather
than to consider them separately.

The aim of the three writers was,
it seems, to enlist support for the
recruitment and admission to W&L
in larger number than in the past
of students variously described as
“underprivileged” and “culturally
deprived.” Both articles contained
unflattering, or unfriendly, refer-
ences to the (naturally selfish and
villainous) “middle class” folk whose
“environment” has produced most
of the students enrolled here and
elsewhere in the past century, and
whose life-style and values have
been attacked with revived zest by
avant-garde writers, filmmakers,
and demagogues since the advent of
the New Frontier nearly a decade
ago. “Cultural bias” is the current
cliche that covers the colleges’ effort
to ascertain whether the elementary
tools of advanced learning are in
the possession of prospective stu-
dents. One gathers that a familiarity
with Shakespeare is the mark of the
“culturally biased” twelfth-grader,
and that high school courses in
“ghetto sociology” or the African
dance will erase said bias.

Beyond the condemnation of mid-
die-class values in America’s (re-
gretfully) middle-class society, and

Admissions Report:
‘Absolutely Nearsighted”
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Although the Executive Commit-
tee members might have done the
right thing by approving the Admis-
sion report on recruiting underprivi-
leged students, they were absolutely
nearsighted. They included all sorts
of provisions to enable the underpri-
vileged students to come here. But
did these EC men ever wonder if
these deprived students would stay
here for long? I don’t think so.

The two most probable reasons
for them to leave would be econo-
mic and social. The EC didn’t inves-
tigate into these deeply enough, In
this small town, student life is us-
ually centered on fraternities. The
students who have been culturally
deprived will not be able to adjust
to fraternity life as it is now. Some
fraternity people are too snobbish
and will associate only with people
of their own type.

Another reason would be racial.
Will they be racially taunted or be
placed in a corner of a house during
rush? I know. | experienced this and
still have bitter memories from it.
Ironically enough, some EC mem-
bers are in these fraternities.

Unless the admission report places
more emphasis on how these stu-
dents can be adjusted socially in this
school, then I think the report is a
failure and “change for change'’s
sake.”

A Proxy Vote
On the Admissions Report

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Please assist me in correcting an
error in your coverage of the stu-
dent Executive Committee meeting
of March 16. Through perhaps 4
mistake in interpretation by your re-
porter or the deletion of an ex-
planatory senience in the published
article, my position on the Admis-
sions Subcommittee proposal vote
was presented in your article exactly
opposite of my intent, As the other
EC members realize, | have wip
ported the efforts of the subcommii
tee since its inception, and cast my
proxy vote for the proposal exactly
as it was finally accepted.

s/Staman Ogilvie

(Editer'’s Note: Mr. Ogilvie’s proxy

voted for the proposal.)

the reflection of these in college ad-
missions, we come to the suggestion
that the absence of the “underprivil-
eged” here has limited “the inter-
change of different philosophies and
perspectives” that would arise, pre-
sumably, from the arrival on the
campus of various embittered and
perhaps eventually enraged slum
dwellers. Such a view of the restrict-
ed exchange of contrasting ideas
amongst a fairly homogeneous stu-
dent body can be supported, |
should think, by only the slightest
contact with that most common
campus character — the affluent
radical, the son of rich or of well-
off parents who spends his time and
energy at school in lambasting the
heartless Establishment (which has
been for over 30 years, of course,
an Establishment of the Left) and
calling for the overthrow or trans-
formation of everything that the
New Deal and its liberal successors
have produced during the past gen-
eration,

The third important point made
by the “Ring-tum Phi’s” contribu-
tors of last week was (so one reads
it) that the lack of an even more
heterogeneous student community
than W&L’s “may have contributed
to the lessening attractiveness of this
school, as witnessed by the recent
yearly decline in the number of pro-
spective students.” Indeed. And so
may the sinking of Atlantis have
led eventually to the eruption of
Krakatoa a few centuries later.
What does seem probable, if the ar-
gument may be shifted to less theo-
retical ground, is that the near trip-
ling of tuition in ten years ($750 to
$1900) has, unavoidably, deterred
many of those who would in less in-
flationary times have permitted their
m9 to apply to Washington and

We may put our delicate con-
sciences at rest by remembering that
the great state institutions—collec-
tively Behemoth University, for

plish the work of civilizing and edu-
cating the children of the few re-

“militants” and “activists” do not
permanently destroy Behemoth U.
A more important question, for us,
concerns the nature of the crusade
for “underprivileged” admissions at
WAL at this moment.

It appears safe to assume:

1. that the issue has been ex-
ploited largely by poseurs in
both the student body and
faculty who reckon lofty
gestures and noble rhetoric
about “human dignity” and
—to quote a “Ring-tum Phi”
contributor — “our respon-
sibilities as human beings”
to be shortcuts to applause
and even reward;

2. that William Buckley was

The Parking Problem:

“A Lack of Foresight”

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

The university administration has
readily admitted that the construc-
tion of the addition to Doremus
Gym suffers from a visible lack of
foresight and planning. A particu-
larly glaring planning oversight is
evidenced by the present parking
problem. The lack of reasonable
parking facilities has sparked the
imagination of many students, re-
sulting in rather original free-lance
“auto-art” expression.

Since the only entrance and exit
to the present parking space is by
way of the driveway coming off of
Route 60 behind the old dorms, it is
suggested that parking be restricted
in order to allow cars to move freely
both to and from the campus at the
same time. The present one-lane
situation is not only inconvenient
and highly distressing, but also po-
tentially dangerous due to lack of
space and vision. It is suggested
that parking on tht driveway be re-
stricted between the hours of 9 a.m.
and § p.m.

s/Richard F. Boyer

correct in suggesting a year
or two ago that most pro-
fessors are bored with their
lives or their work (or both)
and that many of those who
are braying for the “under-
privileged” and “deprived”
quite hope that members of
those groups, once here, will
produce some of the exhilar-
ating chaos that their fel-
lows have created in colleges
and high-schools around the

country;
3. that those who run our
smaller institutions, vain

men as men are, cannot re-
sist following the examples
(happy and unhappy) of
Harvard and Yale, and that
since the purchase, or “sub-
sidy,” of the poor is the cur-
rent vogue at those institu-
tions the same policy is a
tempting one for educators
in the provinces, After all,
if W&L is to remain a lead-
er, it must follow the others
forthwith.

In short, the issue turns upon a
definition of the responsibility of
the university to itself and to soc-
iety. Both will be served if admini-
strators, teachers, and students can
be recalled to the task of an orderly
and disciplined transmission and ex-
ploration of knowledge (with or
without apparent social “relevance”)
and to the conviction that a univer-
sity can and should remain precisely
an island of tranquillity and decor-
um above all when the rest of soc-
iety shows signs of madness. In no
way can a community of serious
teachers and learners wish to echo,
much less to experience, the bar-
baric and even criminal ways of the
outside world’s seedier, if one will,
underprivileged, elements. The work
of preserving civilization and learn-
ing was achieved a thousand years
ago by a dedicated minority amid a
near-savage populace; let us hope
to avoid the irony of sacrificing both
today—in an era of a relatively cul-
tivated majority beset by two de-
ranged minorities, a handful of the
malcontent poor and, much worse,
an alienated intelligentsia.

Conventional Dress:

“A Poor Choice”

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

Even though there has not been
much printed on the matter lately,
the issue of conventional dress still
seems to be in many minds around
campus,

It is difficult to understand how
anyone can be so concerned about
students who do not choose to wear
coats and ties to classes, or any-
where else. Contrary to what seems
to be popular belief, the people who
do not choose to attire themselves
in coats and ties are not really all
slobs or freaks.

The main argument heard in favor
of conventional dress is that it gives
WAL something “unique.” If this is
the driving force behind the coat
and tie movement, then the people
supporting it have certainly made a
poor choice in what to be unique
about.

Something as petty, inane, and,
using a cliched word, irrelevant, as
wearing a coat and tie on campus is
nothing to brag about in 1970,
though it may have been in 1940,
which seems to be the prevalent
mind-set of WAL.

WAL does have something else
“unique” about it, according to sev-
eral outside sources, including some
very frank books about colleges.

This is a lack of intellectual curio-
sity among the students. Could this
be related to the “intellect” that
thinks a student body in coats and
ties is unique among universities?

A better thing to brag about
would be a student body that IS uni-
que, whether or not it looks it. The
uniqueness must be in the mind, not
worn on the body.

: From The J-School...

  

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

The Democratic Party has called
in Lawrence F, O’Brien to save a
sinking ship. As the new national
chairman, it’s O’Brien’s monumental
task to rescue the Democratic Party
from the rot that now infests it.

If any man can revive the Demo-
cratic Party, it’s Lawrence O’Brien,
the party’s most skilled professional
politician. O’Brien ran the presi-
dential campaigns of John Kennedy
in 1960 and Hubert Humphrey in
1968, steering both to a first ballot
nomination and Kennedy to the
White House. Humphrey was a nar-
row loser, although the odds against
the former Vice President were tre-
mendous at the outset of the cam-
paign.

However, the task of saving the
bankrupt Democratic Party might
prove to be too much, even for
O'Brien. The party is operating at
a monthly loss of $65,000. During
the 1968 presidential campaign,
half a million people contributed to
the Nixon campaign, but less than
100,000 contributed to the Hum-
phrey campaign.

During the last four years, Demo-
crats have lost not only the White
House, but also 15 governors, nine
senators, 50 congressmen, and nine
state legislatures.

And public opinion polls indicate
that things are not going to get
much better for the party of Jeffer-
son and Jackson. According to the
latest Gallup Poll, 48 per cent of
the American electorate consider
themselves Democrats, compared to
52 per cent just two years ago. And
only 26 per cent of the 25-and-
under voters identify themselves as
Democrats.

O’Brien can only do so much by
himself to save the Democratic
Party. What is really needed is a

crop of new faces to seek political
office. After the Goldwater debacle
of 1964, the Republican Party
launched its comeback on the many
new faces who were elected in 1966
—Reagan, Percy, Baker, Shafer,
Griffin, et al.

Currently however, the Democra-
tic Party is almost devoid of excit-
ing young politicians who might
emerge as national figures. John
and Robert Kennedy were tragically
killed and Ted is a pitiful weakling,
lacking in all leadership qualities.
Among the current party leaders,
only Edmund Muskie has shown the
potential to emerge as a nationally
prominent leader. Muskie was a
very attractive _ vice-presidential
candidate and is now championing
the fight for environmental improve-
ment, apparently the movement of
the 70's,

However, as a_ potential presi-
dential candidate Muskie has the
disadvantage of representing a small
state. No presidential candidate this
century has been from a state with
as few electoral votes as Maine.

Many Democratic leaders feel
the man who can revive the Party
is currently a Republican. If John
Lindsay has national aspirations, he
must become a Democrat. His own
party rebuffed him last year when a
conservative nobody named John
Marchi won the Republican primary
for Mayor of New York City. Lind-
say ran for re-election on the Liberal
Party ticket and won.

Certainly the Republican Party
will never nominate Lindsay for na-
tional office. Because of Lindsay's
strength in the cities, Nixon would
have liked to have had him as a

An Apology

Due to an oversight in
the March 18 edition of the
Ring-tum Phi, a misspelled
word in the article “Bet-
hea, Azuma Defend Ad-
missions Report” substanti-
ally changed the meaning
of that story.

The last sentence of the
third paragraph of that ar-
ticle should have read, “An
equally important part of
this learning exists outside
the lecture hall and lab-
oratory; this can only be
termed ‘experiential’ edu-
cation.”

The error substituted
“experimental” for “experi-
ential,” adding to their de-
fense of a program to
bring underprivileged stu-
dents here connotations
that were neither their in-
tent nor ours.

Jekyll-Hyde
Life Complex
In Apartments

By Reed Byrum

The student apartment stands to-
day as one of the more formal bas-
tions of collegiate independence in
America. Besides the nonconform-
ing, although at times seemingly
conforming, use of the body as an
expression of the will, the apart-
ment remains steeped in its tradi-
tion and pure in its symbolism of
free assertion,

The apartment exists in various
forms, which can be divided into
two basic types: the town and the
country quarters, Each has its own
special advantages and suits the
style of the students living in them.

The latter type takes several
forms: a converted barn, an old
farm house or an apartment com-
plex situated well away from camp-
us activity. It attracts the very real-
istic student—the one who knows
that during the winter months snow
will prevent his attendance of class.
Despite this distinct drawback, the
country apartment is one of the
more popular kinds of student hous-
ing.

In the vastness of the countryside,
student habitats can be easily spot-
ted by the most traditional of all
hallmarks—the crushed beer can.
Scattered about the front lawn, beer
cans mingle with their glass prede-
cessors and converge upon a path-
way leading to the entrance of the
house.

The interior is marked by ancient
furniture, peeling walls, layers of
dust, and piles of garbage. Upon
further study one also finds an ex-
ceptionally happy and satisfied stu-
dent. Carefree and uninhibited, he
pursues his unrestricted pastimes
with the greatest of exuberance, ar-
chetypically characterized by a beer
can in flight past a tube and on its
way to a fireplace.

The enormity of size provides for
another luxury—the extension tele-
phone. This can be employed to
great advantage while one’s room-

Changes on the Dance Board...

By Joe Tompkins
Last week the Executive Commit-
tee passed significant proposals con-
cerning the Dance Board and class
dues,

In the past, the vice-president of
the Dance Board has been chosen
by the Advisory Council of the
Dance Board, which consists of the
president of the Dance Board, the
faculty advisors to the Dance Board,
and the president of the student
body. The vice-president usually be-
comes president of the Dance Board
the following year.

In the hope that more students
who feel they are qualified to serve
on the Dance Board will decide to
show their interest, and with the
belief that it will be beneficial for
all students to become more aware
of the problems and the responsibili-
ties of the Dance Board, the selec-
tion procedure for the vice-president
of the Dance Board was changed.

 

ways to see and do a lot for a little.
There are 14 different countries and
cities covered by this year’s edi-
tions, which range from “The Carri-
bean on $5.00 a Day” to “Japan on
$5.00 a Day.” The latter would be
especially appealing in this year of
Japan's Expo ‘70. Then there are
books for specific people—such as
“Student Guide to Europe” and
“Follow the Fun.”

Armed with a youth hostel mem-
bership card, an international stu-
dent id. card and an agile thumb,
the young people are roaming far
and wide. They even report back on
their findings to the Harvard student
agencies, who published “Let's Go,”
a student-written guide to travel in
this country and in Europe.

There’s no end to the number of
books about places to be visited, if
one felt inclined to bone up on them
before arrival. Michener's “Iberia”
is a finely written, lively account of
Spain, which makes one want to
light out for the Spanish Airlines.
There is an eye-catching book, “Lost
towns and Roads in America,” that
guarantees avoidance of the ten-
tacles of Interstate highways,

Everybody has his favorite “don't-
miss” places, so | want to add a
couple of my own. First, picnic
lunch under the Pont du Gard in
Nimes, France; and second, Cam-
den, Maine on the Penobscot Bay
when the windjammers are in

 

Beginning this spring, the vice-presi-
dent will be elected in a student
body election at the same time as
the election for student body presi-
dent, vice-president, and secretary.

However, to be eligible to run for
vice-president of the Dance Board, a
student must be a rising junior and
must have served on the Dance
Board Advisory Board or on the
Dance Board itself. This stipulation
was made so that any candidate for

A ani 8

the office would have some acquain-
tance with the duties of the position,

Realizing that there may be some
students interested in being vice-
prsident of the Dance Board who
are not on the Advisory Board, each
fraternity has been instructed to ap-
point another representative to the
Advisory Board for the remainder
of the year. Applications are also
being taken by Dean Kumpuris

| Trouble in Mudville

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

Alas, there is no joy in Mud-
ville once again. But this time we
can't pin the blame on poor old
Casey. Baseball as a game, as a
pasttime, and now as big business
is in trouble, deep trouble. It’s been
said before, many times, but al-
ways there was the Spring when
teams old and new, champion and
also-ran could make their migration
to Florida’s emerald cities of opti-
mism. A brand new start, and it
happened each and every Spring.
Until now.

A while back, the owners decided
that their game needed a new man
at the reigns. General William Ec-
kers road as Commissioner had in-
deed been rocky but only because
he was so unsuited to the role. En-
ter Bowie Kuhn. As Commissioner
he quickly showed his mettle by
solving numerous squabbles involv-

trade any player with a lawsuit
challenging baseball's reserve clause.
This would in effect undermine the
whole structure of the game and
virtually make every player free-
lance. Flood’s having trouble with
his case, but he’s gotten pesky Mar-
vin Miller all riled with the bit
about the reserve clause. Miller is
the attorney for the player’s associa-
tion and with him at the helm, they
are threatening a general strike. So
maybe there won't be any baseball
at all this year. Unbelievably this is
the least of Kuhn’s worries.

Denny McLain is the biggest al-
batross this year. As you know,
Denny got himself messed up with
Al Capone himself and had been
planning to bring back Detroit's
notorious Purple Gang before
Sports Illustrated so boldly inter-
rupted the whole affair. Actually the
severity of the situation is indeed
very critical, McLain was betting

    

For W&L Freestyler

W&L’s freestyle sprinter, Bill
Brumback, proved once again that
he is one of the fastest. For the sec-
ond consecutive year, Brumback
earned All-America status in the 50
yard freestyle event.

Out of 52 of the best college
swimmers originally entered in the
event, Brumback ultimately finished
10th in the 50 yard freestyle. The
first twelve finishers in each event

come to expect headaches from
Allen even though they're of the
migrain type now. Ron Reed of the
Braves, one of the game’s best
young pitchers broke his collar bone
and won't be back till June. Mike
Shannon, a Cardinal mainstay for
years developed a kidney disease
and is out for perhaps the whole
season. And, of course, the “Hawk.”
Ken Harrelson, the Joe Namath of
the game, will miss most if not all
of the °70 season with a broken leg.
Flood, McLain, Shannon, Reed and
Harrelson. The season is still two
weeks away, just time enough for
one or two others to bite the dust.

With Flood questioning the legal-
ity of the game and McLain its in-
tegrity, the plight of the “Seattle”
Pilots adds to the ruckus by intro-
ducing the dreaded echoes of bush-
league accusations to the Commis-
sioner’s ears, The season opens on

Brumback, in the qualifying heats,

a 22.513 seconds while first place
was a mere 22.2 seconds. With less
than a_ three-tenths of a second
spread between first and tenth shows
the highly competitive nature of this
event,

Brumback also participated in the
100 yard freestyle event and scored
a 49,746 second time which was the
best of the year for Brumback. A
49.514 second finish was the last to
qualify and it was won in 48.1 sec
onds.

The championships were held at
Oakland University—just north of
Detroit—in a newly constructed
pool equipped with electronic timers
that can time with accuracy up to a
thousanths of a second. The N.C.-
A.A. College Division Swimming
Championships were won by the
University of California—Irvine and
in second was Springfield College—
Coach Stearns’s alma mater.

Also traveling to the meet were
sophomore Bim Clark and fresh-
man Alan Corwith. Clark partici-
pated in the 200 and 100 dolphin
butterfly events. Clark’s time in the
100 yard event was 56.1. Needed to
qualify was a 55.056 second per-
formance. Clark's time in the 200

Depth Is Key
To Lacrosse
This Season

If there’s such a thing as “bap-
tism under fire,” then Washington
and Lee University’s lacrosse play-
ers must be full-fledged Christians
by now.

The Generals have had five pre-
season scrimmages so far, including
two each with Yale, last year’s Ivy
League lacrosse champions, and the
University of Pennsylvania, the Ivy
runner-up.

The scrimmages have been a de-
finite plus factor.

“We are so much further ahead
this year over last year,” said W&l
lacrosse coach Dick Szlasa.
“Through the scrimmages, we have
found that our biggest advantage is
that we have a lot of people of
equal ability.

“We should be able to do con-
siderable substituting without affect-
ing our strength,” Coach Szlasa said.

This is particularly true of the
defense, where six boys should play
a lot: senior co-captain Ned Coslett,
a third team All-American choice
last year; senior Frank Stearns,
sophomores Tommy Smith and
John Larmour, and freshmen John
Rogers and Don Eavenson.

Four players also should see con-
siderable action on attack: sopho-
more Scott Neese, last year’s lead-
scorer; senior Tom Groton and
freshmen Bob Brumback and Hank
Slauson.

With more depth, Coach Szlasa
will be able to run three midfields
in and out of the games this year:
last year he had only two. Middies
Whit Morrill and Chip Tompkins
have looked particularly good in
practice, along with senior co-cap-
tain Jay Meriweather.

The real standout so far has been
goal-keeper Bill Ingersoll. “He could
develop into one of the best goalies
in our division,” commented Coach
Szlasa.

The Generals will open a tough
11-game schedule Thursday at home
against Geneseo State College of
New York. The real toughies on
the schedule are the Universities of
Virginia and North Carolina, and
Towson of Baltimore.

Generals Lose Openers
Against Long Island U.,
Head Southward Saturday

By Bob LaRue

Washington and Lee dropped
both ends of an exhibition game
doubleheader, bowing to Long Is-
land University 5-3 and 5-0, last
Saturday. The games did not count
because there was not a sanctioned
umpire present.

The Generals took the lead in
the first game 1-0 as LIU’s starting
pitcher, southpaw All-American
Charlie Capello walked four batters,
Bill Miller, W&L’s opening hurler,
shut out the Blackbirds in his three
innings of work, but in the fourth
LIU touched reliefer Bill Greener

Jacksonville Dolphin’s Season
A Contribution To Basketball

By Mike Riley

The NCAA Basketball Finals in
College Park, Maryland last Satur-
day afternoon went the way most
of the oddsmakers and many of the
fans in the country wanted it.

Coach John Wooden's Bruins of
UCLA won their unprecedented
fourth national college basketball
title in a row by defeating Jackson-
ville University 80-69.

But it seems the fans who cheered
the victorious Bruins and actually
booed some of the players on the
defeated JU ball club failed to ap-
preciate what the Dolphins did for
college basketball this year and
what changes they may effect in the
college ranks in the future.

Some harsh critics of Coach Joe
Williams’ Dolphins seemed to feel
JU had no right to be in the NCAA
regionals at all. They claimed that
Jacksonville's opponents this season
gave them no contest in many en-
counters.

JU, however, met and defeated
Harvard, Georgetown, and (at home)
Florida State—teams with better
than average squads in their confer-
ences—and went on to become the
only college team in history to aver-
age over 100 points per game. It

was no fluke that Jacksonville got
an invitation to the Regionals and
after that they really proved some
people wrong.

Jacksonville entered the regionals
as a Virtual unknown to many fans.
Yet, led by Artis Gilmore, Rex
Morgan, and Vaughn Wedeking, the
JU cagers single-handedly defeated
the “Kentucky Coalition”——Western
Kentucky and No. 1 Kentucky.
Sandwiched between these two vic-
otries was a defeat of one of the

Neer Triumphs

Washington & Lee missed the
NIT, but it was well represented in
the PIT—the prestigious and star-
studded Portsmouth _ Invitational
Fournament, now in its 18th year.

Both of the Generals, Mike Neer
and Mel Cartwright—were invited,
but only Mike could make it, and
make it he did, with the Chesapeake
Athletic Club, which won the cham-
pionship.

Maxi-Mike was teamed with top
pro prospect Dave Cowens of Flori-
da State and potentials Bob Cre-
mins, South Carolina captain; Van
Williford, MVP of the ACC, and

for a run on a walk, a stolen base
and a single.

The Blackbirds broke the game
open in the fifth when Bill Greener
served up a grand-slam home run.
The Generals came back for a pair
of runs in the bottom of the seventh
in a last ditch rally attempt, but
LIU reliever John Seaman put the
stops to it and the final score was
5-3.

In the nightcap, the Blackbirds
blanked the Generals on three hits,
5-0. Southpaw Rick Gatto combined
with Jim Wallace for the LIU ef-
fort. Tim Haley, W&L’s starter,
was touched for a run in the third
and the loss. Relief appearances
were made by Haller Jackson and
Don McMillan.

The Generals looked fairly sharp,
but LIU’s superior pitching did
WA&L in. Coach Lyles attributed the
losses to mental mistakes. “We
weren’t ready on every pitch,” he
noted.

Washington and Lee’s diamond
squad was rained out Monday in its
single game with Cleveland State.
As a result, the Generals scheduled
a doubleheader yesterday with the
Vikings.

mate is calling to get one a blind
date; the woods—conveniently plac-
ed near the house—can then be used
as a sanctuary of escape and hiding
when deceit riddles the girl's reply.

The country apartment's urban
counterpart is designed for a more
courageous breed of student: one
who is still able to cut a class guilt-
lessly, knowing well that neither
distance nor weather are true hin-
drances to class attendance. The
pathway of beer cans is replaced by
a third-story stairway filled with
such containers, which are hidden
in the darkness of a burnt out light
bulb among piles of dust. The en-
trance to the apartment is similar
to the approach to the inter-sanctum.

Dimly lit by flourescent lights, a
condition much like the country ver-
sion exists in all respects but quant-
ity—size, of course, is the only re-
striction to this. The delapidated
furniture of past generations is out-
lined by a bluish cast given off by
the always activated tube. Greek
symbols on the walls connote the
fraternal origins of ownership and
identify the apartment as one of the
several outlets of underclass expres-
sion of a certain brotherhood.

Food, remnants of thwarted ef-
forts at cooking, lays in decay
among cigarettes extinguished on
cracked plates. Album covers long
since separated from their entrails
are spread carelessly on a thread-
bare rug, almost completely swept
out of its existence.

Weekends and parental visits de-
cidely alter the composed at-
mosphere of apartments. Temporary
restoration is initiated by the in-
habitants in a brief burst of feelings
of health, sanitation and hypocrisy
—the letter having, however, the
greatest rewards.

The Jekyll-and-Hyde complex of
the collegiate apartment is integral
to the nature of student living. The
latter is much more pronounced
than the former, and thus one of the
more earthy aspects of student ex-
pression arises from its domain,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Washington and Lee Generals tennis team opened its 1970 season
yesterday on an encouraging note by swamping the University of
Akron, 8 matches to 1. Led by junior Bill Gatlin (pictured above) who
won his match as first singles 9-7, 6-2 and then teamed with Jeff Dris-
coll to win first doubles, the team had no trouble in dispensing with its
major college opponent in a match that was played at VMI.

country; and JU rose from obscur-
ity to national renown.

The fans couldn't seem to appre-
ciate all this. And the UCLA sup-
porters couldn't even wait for young
Joe Williams to receive his team’s
trophy before they began cheering
for their once-again champion
Bruins,

It would seem they would have
the respect of true champions and
appreciate the valiant effort made
by Jacksonville.

However, Lindsay could win

John Kennedy, and as Kennedy
proved in 1960, you can win the
Democratic nomination in the pri-
maries and to hell with the bosses.

With the vote for 18-year-olds
almost assured, the young voters
will determine the elections of the
future, and it is these voters that
O'Brien must win over to the De
mocratic Party. Only by cultivating
young, energetic candidates can he
hope to win the young voters.

As Democratic Chairman,
O'Brien's first goal should be to
make John Lindsay a Democrat.
