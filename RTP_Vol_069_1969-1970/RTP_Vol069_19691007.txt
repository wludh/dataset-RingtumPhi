One purpose of the reorganiza
tion was to provide more direct
alumni voice in the affairs of the

. Faculty o.k.’s cars for ai

d students,

girls are approved on upper floor

In meeting yesterday, the faculty
approved a report by the Student
Affairs Committee calling — for
changes in faculty regulations gov-
erning fraternities. The changes had
been requested in a petition from the
Interfraternity Council.

The content of the resolution
which was approved is as follows:

“To (1) achieve greater freedom
and responsibility for those students
living in fraternity houses, (2) attain
a situation of equity in parietal
regulations for fraternity members
vis-a-vis those students who live in
University dormitories, and (3) pro-
vide an incentive for the integration
of classes in the fraternity houses by
encouraging greater numbers of
juniors and seniors to live in the
fraternities, with the realization that
such housing is more convenient and
less expensive than other student
housing, the IFC petitions that the
following resolution be adopted by
the faculty of Washington and Lee:

“A. Female guests may be allow-
ed on the upper floors of the fra-
ternity houses between the hours of
5 P.M. on Friday and 12 Midnight
Sunday, with the understanding that
overnight visitations are prohibited.
IFC regulations will permit such

visitations until 3 A.M. on Friday
and Saturday nights.

“B. The Executive Committee of
each fraternity will propose a plan
concerning hours to the entire fra-
ternity which must reach a consensus

on the plan, which they will abide
by during the academic year.

1. A consensus will constitute
agreement of at least 75 percent of
the members of the fraternity.

2. Standards of gentlemanly con-
duct, which reflect a sense of ap-
propriateness and decorum, and a
concern for the rights and sensibili-
ties of others are to be observed.

3. Each plan shall include adequ-
ate provisions for enforcement by
the fraternity.

“C. The Judicial Board of the IFC
will approve or reject each frater-
nity’s proposal, Each approved plan
will then be submitted to the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee for review.

“PD. Violation of these regulations
will result in Social Probation for
the fraternity, the length of time
depending upon the extent of the
violation.”

The faculty last May adopted new
social regulations permitting students
in university dormitories to draw up
plans for visitation by female guests
during weekend hours. Until today’s
action, faculty regulations had pro-
hibited visitation by female guests
above the first floor of fraternity
houses. The prohibition will be lifted
as soon as individual fraternities
submit acceptable plans for approval
by the IFC Judicial Board and by
the Student Affairs Committee.

in another business matter, the
faculty adopted a report of the Stu-
dent Financial Aid Committee which

spells out changes in regulations re-
garding student ownership of cars,
to be effective the second semester
of the 1969-70 academic year. The
statement of new policy reads as
follows:

“Although the committee consid-
ers that ownership and/or control of
a motor-driven vehicle of any type
by the recipient of financial assis-
tance will bear directly on the degree
of financial need demonstrated,
such ownership and/or operation is
not prohibited during periods for
which awards have been made—pro-
vided, the applicant or recipient
makes full, written disclosure of all
relevant facts bearing on such own-
ership and/or operation, University
automobile regulations notwithstand-
ing.

“If a student keeps a motor ve-
hicle in this area during the school
year, the Committee ordinarily will
add the ‘Blue Book Value’ of the

motor vehicle to the student's as-
sets, and the student's financial aid
will be reduced by the usual frac-
tion of student assets used by the
College Scholarship Service: sopho-
mores 14, juniors 1/3, seniors, 4.”

In another matter, the faculty con-
sidered and acted on a_ student's
petition regarding proposed Vietnam
moratorium activities in Lexington
on October 15.

A petition to the faculty Execu-
tive Committee from Peter F. Zim-
merman, a W&L junior from Gar-
den City, N.Y., requested that fac-
ulty be given the option of dismiss-
ing their classes on October 15 and
that no tests be given on that day.

In response, the faculty Executive
Committee adopted this statement
“In view of the activities scheduled
for October 15, the Executive Com-
mittee wishes to remind each mem-
ber of the faculty of his option to

McCall announces VP's
and cocktail party plans

By Reed Byrum
Mike McCall, Sophomore class
president, announced — preliminary
prepaartions for Openings ‘69, Octo-
ber 17 and 18. A Phi Gam from
Louisville, McCall also released the

names of his seventeen vice-presi-
dents who will assist him in the
arrangements for the weekend.

Plans have been made for a cock-
tail party on Friday afternoon from
2:30 p.m. until 5:30 p.m. A pink
lemonade and grain concoction,
reminiscent of last year’s Springs,
will be the featured drink, with the
Kallabash Corporation providing
background music. The affair will
take place in Red Square behind the
Beta House.

McCall disclosed the theme of
the dance set to be “Today, Tonight
& Tomorrow,” signifying the timing
of the weekend. The concerts will
commence at 8:00 p.m. both Friday
and Saturday. Decorations will con-
sist of a simple black backdrop.

In anticipation of the weekend,
the Sophomore class organized a
drive to gain parietals for fraternity
houses. A petition was presented to
the faculty for consideration yester-
day and was passed on affirmatively.

The vice-presidents were chosen
by the members of their own house,
rather than by McCall, Vice-presi-
dent of the Class is Steve Robinson,
a Phi Psi. In charge of the decora-
tions will be David Harbert, Phi
Gam, and David Comiey will make
arrangements at Red Square for the

cocktail party: Rob Turnbul will
head the liquor committee.

REVIEW aud OUTLOOK Leééters to the editor...
SwimIn ’70, moratorium--pro

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday, October 7, 1969

In fairness to all

In the past week, a lot has been said and much has been
done concerning Washington and Lee and October 15. Time
alone can judge the value and meaning of these efforts.

However, we can at this early date commend the fairness
and respect for the opinions of others shown by many groups
which have become involved in this issue. Especially note-
worthy in this regard was the position taken by the faculty.

The faculty statement, drafted by the Faculty Executive
Committee and approved by the faculty as a whole, does not
direct anyone to a specific course of action. Rather, the policy
statement—which parallels in its open tone the resolution of
the student Executive Committee—leaves the final judgment
on the moratorium to the discretion of the individual. A pro-
fessor may dismiss regular classes “for justifiable educational
purposes.”

We, as responsible students, must also respect the convic-
tions of others. We must not interfere with another’s right to
attend class or to hold class, nor with his right to gain edu-
cational benefit otherwise on October 15, if he wishes.

New gym key

Moratorium-con
Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I read with disappointment the
resolution recently passed by the
Executive Committee encouraging
selective participation in the pro-
posed October 15 moratorium. I
cannot concede that the proper juris-
diction of the Executive Committee
extends to expression of views on
national and international political
questions. While the resolution falls
short of calling for a general boy-
cott or cancellation of classes, its
general import is to place the stamp
of approval of the Washington and
Lee student body on the proposed
moratorium, With the undoubted
controversy and ill will generated
among alumni and friends of the
university by this resolution, the
Executive Committee has committed
a clear abuse of discretion by an
action which can only be detri-
mental to Washington and Lee.

I also wish to protest the action
of the administration in allowing
the moratorium committee to have
exclusive use of Lee Chapel on
Sunday last. Being proud of this uni-

verstiy and its heritage. | had hoped
to show my visiting sister-in-law and
her husband our famous Lee Chapel.
Although there are a number of
meeting rooms in the new Student
Center in addition to numerous
classrooms on campus which would
have been sufficient for the number
of persons attending the meeting,
Lee Chapel was reserved exclusively
for the use of this committee. In
that absence from class as an eX-
pression of political belief would
not seem to coincide with the aims
of this university, at least in my
mind, the giving over of our most
famous and precious facility to a
group advocating this action is at
odds with common sense.

SwimIn ’70

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:
Your editorial in support of Swim-
In ‘70 is very much appreciated.
Over $13,000 has been pledged so
far and we are still hopeful that the
goal will be reached, as many gifts
are still being received and they

can be pledged over a three year
period.

This awareness of the community
on the part of the student, bodes
well for many healthy encounters in
the future, similar to the fine work
done by the students for the Lexing-
ton Boys Club and other proejcts.

Moratorium-pro
Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:

For four years I had been among
those who futilely encouraged the
Ring-tum Phi to expand its jour-
nalistic ken beyond who-pledged-
where. Consequently, | was delight-
ed to notice upon taking up your
last issue that the ban on reality had
been lifted. Staring us in the face
were two articles “reporting”, each
in its own way, on the local efforts
to organize a non-partisan Day of
Concern on October 15. One reading
of these journalistic efforts, however,

and con

succeeded where the spectacle of
four years of bland mediocrity had
failed. It convinced me that the pro-
per province of the R-t-p really is
trivia.

I must admit that my original im-
pulse was to credit the morass of
misrepresentations and falsehoods I
encountered to premeditated and

deliberate malice. On — second
thought, though, I realized this

could not be so. A conspirator, be-
ing human, would have made at
least one small mistake, would have
allowed one small truth to slip past.
Such consistent and total deviation
from the facts could, I concluded,
only be the product of absolute in-
competence,

I am afraid readers will hardly
believe me (even I still find this
situation incredible. I think we
Americans have a residual faith in
our news media, the truthmakers)
but | am compelled to attempt to
repair the damage done to a con-
structive and diligently prepared pro-
gram which is of significant potential
value to our community, I will not

to WGL athletic future

Editor's Note: The following is transeribed from a
taped interview of Mr. Gene Corrigan taken by Logan
Scott and Bob Yevich. Mr. Corrigan assumed the
duties of director of intercollegiate athletics and head of
the department of physical education here in early
April.

Formerly administrative assistant to Atlantic Coast
Conference Commissioner James H, Weaver, Corrigan
began his college teaching career at W&L in 1955, In
1958, he moved to the athletic department at the Uni-
versity of Virginia, where he remained until 1967 when
he joined the ACC,

INTERVIEWER: Mr. Corrigan, have you noticed any
significant changes in Washington and Lee now that
you are back here as Athletic Director?

CORRIGAN: No, not significant, but I think there
have been some changes.

Of course, one significant change | think Washing-
ton and Lee needs is this new gym. | remember the day
1 came back, as | drove up to Doremus Gymnasium
| thought, what in the world am I doing here—this
has got to be the worst building in the world. There
haven't been any great changes in athletics, although
things have levelled off performance-wise.

When I left here basketball had been very good,
and had just started going down; the subsidized athletic
program had ended but we still had subsidized teams on
the schedule: football was just horrible—in the three
years | was here we only won one or two games—so
things have levelled off from that standpoint.

 

INTERVIEWER: Generally speaking, since you have
had expericnce in the “big-time”, how do you think the
small college system of athletics compares to that of a
large university?

CORRIGAN: Well, let me say this, when you talk
about “big-time” athletics, you are only talking about
iwo sports, and usually you are only talking about one
—football

Big-time athletics, and this is strictly a personal
opinion and | might be one hundred percent wrong,
but big-time athletics belong to big schools, and |
mean big enrollment state-sponsored schools.

Try to find a major college football team among
the small private schools. 1 just do not think you can
because they have all drifted away from it. They had
io—which brings us up to your point what is the differ-
ence between the two. Let's take Duke University as a
good example, they have been very prominent in
basketball in the past few years, Our basketball pro-
gram, and football, is very different from their pro-
gram—in emphasis, money, and a lot of other things

But the rest of our program is basically the same
They don't give scholarships in tennis, golf. wrestling,
soccer or lacrosse or even in baseball that | know of
So we're interested in starting a good recruiting pro
gram to help us compete with Duke in those sports on
un even basis, And | think we can, because we did
before when I was here, We could beat them in soccer,
and we always beat them in lacrosse

INTERVIEWER: Do you personally feel that the non-
subsidized athletic program we have here is the best
program for W&L?

CORRIGAN: I don’t know if it’s the best way; I think
it’s the only way. I don’t know if Washington and Lee
could afford it otherwise. My feeling is that when you
sit down and start to calculate, W&L just could not
stay in the business. To be competitive in football—and
by that | mean competing with UVa, Duke, and places
like that—you would have to give at least 120 football
scholarships. At the cost of going to school here, that
would run $3400-3500 per boy per year. This means
close to a half-million dollars before you bought a
uniform, paid a coach, or did anything. Then, who is
there to watch you play. We've only got 12,000 living
alumni, and as many of them live on the other side of
the Mississippi as on this side. So you have no constitu-
ency. Besides, where are you going to build a stadium
in Lexington?

I think the Washington and Lee program is good.
But let me say this, any program on any level is only
good as long as you are winning; if not, then it’s not
a good program.

INTERVIEWER: Would you say there is any differ-
ence in spirit between the athlete here and the “big-
time” athlete?

CORRIGAN: | do not think there is a whole lot of
difference in the athlete. | don't think there is really
any difference. Some of the boys here might even have
a little more character than some of their counterparts
in the bigger schools, although that’s not really fair to
say. That would be a selfish obesrvation on my part
because I'm here now. But is the atmosphere here
different? Holy cow, yes. The University of South
Carolina, for instance, has a 140-piece marching band.
Why they spend as much money painting the football
field as some schools spend on their whole football
program.

INTERVIEWER: Are the coaches and teams here
under the same strain to win as they are in the big con-
ferences? That is, is the emphasis here upon winning
“per se” or is it on individual enjoyment and satisfac-
tion?

CORRIGAN: | think being able to win is more im-
portant here because it’s more personal. Our boys de-
vote a lot of time to athletics, time which could easily
be spent doing something else, but they enjoy playing
sports .. . | think the pressure is the same, but for
different reasons, such as personal pride, which really
is the best reason. If you mean some alumnus getting
on our backs, sure, our alumni would be concerned
and ask why if we lost badly, But I don’t blame them,
that would show some interest on their part.

INTERVIEWER: In other words, it wouldn't be hard-
er to get a team “up” for a game here than, say, at a
school like UNC?

CORRIGAN: That's right, the boys here play to win.

Of course, there are some games it is hard to get
the team up for, but there are certain reasons why
they cannot get up. But most of the time this is not the
case. Take the Randolph-Macon game. The football
team was really getting stomped with some bad breaks
like the touchdown just before the half, but they stayed
right in there, This shows they've got character, and
when you've got character, you also have a lot of other
things going for you.

But | feel—and I was thinking of this at that
game—that what we must do is recruit more. We talk
about alumni recruiting—the best recruiters we have is
the student body. If they cannot sell a kid, that kid
can't be sold, We can't sell him. The coaches are not
going to live with him day and night, he's going to live
with his contemporaries, And there are a lot of stu
denis here who care about athletics,

INTERVIEWER: Do you think that the CAC ade-
quately fulfilly the needs of our athletic program, or
de you think we might be better off becoming inde-
— or joining, let's say, the Mason-Dixon Con-
erence!

CORRIGAN; Well, | think the CAC fulfilis a real need
in this fegard: it gives the boys, individually, in a
number of sports the opportunity to win an award, If
we were independent, no one would ever have anything

we will stay with the CAC until or if there is an
alternative. | would not be an independent because for
us that would be very bad

INTERVIEWER: WAL at the present time enjoys a
certain parity with some larger as well as subsidized

schools in such areas as swimming, basketball, wrest-
ling, soccer and lacrosse. Is there a possibility that in
the future W&L will have to rely more and more on
the CAC? In other words, might we eventually become
restricted to the CAC?

CORRIGAN: | don’t think there is any chance of that
at all. The greatest problem with the CAC is not the
schools within the conference—they are all fine schools
but the one big objection is strictly geographic. It is
too impractical to send let’s say our tennis team to
Washington in St. Louis. It’s simply too far. Besides,
why send them out there when we can take them to
major schools close by us.

INTERVIEWER: But don't you think that these sports
might become big-business in the same sense football
has, and thereby virtually exclude the small school?

CORRIGAN: These sports that you mentioned will
never become big-business in the sense football is. It
just will not happen.

Here the philosophy is that if there is sufficient
interest among the students to compete in a certain
sport, we will add that sport to our program.

1, personally, would like to see the beginning of
a squash team, which we will be equipped for after
the completion of the gym. But we won't have one un-
less there is sufficient interest within the student body.

As far as competing with these schools in other
areas besides football, | think we always will be able to
compete . . . for one thing, for a school our size, we
have such a fine group of men as coaches, Of course,
we are not, and let me emphasize this, going to jump
into a big-time schedule in any sport until we are ready
to do it.

INTERVIEWER: How do you judge the unorganized
aspects, that is, the non-intercollegiate, not-intramural
aspects, of our athletic program?

CORRIGAN: Everything here is convenient, parti-
cularly to the dormitories, | was amazed when I came
up here last spring to see so many boys in the gym at
night, palying handball, or basketball, or whatever.

Of course, after the new building is completed, we
will have enough in the way of facilities and lockers
for every person in the Washington and Lee commun-
ity, To have it any other way would be shorichang-
Wes.

INTERVIEWER: Would you say that the overall ath-
letic program, as you see it now, is oriented more to-
wards the intercollegiate man or more towards the
informal athlete, such as the student who comes into
the gym at night to play bandhall?

CORRIGAN: Last year about 30% of the undergradu-
ate student body participated in intercollegiate sports.
Of the remaining 70%, probably 60% of them took
part in the intramurals on some level

Let me mention here that | do feel badly about
one thing. When the students came back this fall we
didn't have a lot of things ready. We moved them up
on top so that they could have their own area rather
than have to move around every day. We wanted to
have two fields up there for the intramurals alone, and
we didn't get this done. But | feel I learned a good
lesson

But back to your point, percentage-wise the system
leans towards intercollegiate sports, At a larger school
fewer students, relatively speaking, participate inter-
collegiately. The sports are here, if a boy wants to play
Certainly, no one will ever pressure a boy to go out if
he doesn't want to himself

The great thing is that our sports are geared so that
: student could come here having had no experience
in a sport, yet gain a great deal of proficiency, and
quite possibly play first-string varsity in that sport be
fore he graduates. He will not be cut from a team, and
if he shows anything at all, he will get the chance to
play

INTERVIEWER: After the new gym is completed, will
it be more likely to emphasize the intercollegiate or
the personal aspects of athletics here? Will it weight
the system one way or the other?

CORRIGAN: | think it will definitely improve both as-
pects. For instance, in intercollegiate sports, it will aid
our recruiting immensely. On the other hand, for the

iverage student we will have improved handball courts
bona fide squash courts, a fine swimming pool

INTERVIEWER: How about the proposed fieldhouse?

CORRIGAN: This is part of the overall plan, the idea
being to build something as large as we can feasily con

struct. It will have a synthetic turf inside enabling us to
use it for anything, including tennis. So, it will function
in intercollegiates and in the other aspects, such as the
physical education program .

 

INTERVIEWER: You mentioned physical education,
do you think our present PE program is adequate?

CORRIGAN: No, it's not. It’s not at all, because the
building isn’t adequate . . . The way I envision it, we
hope to make the course as elective as possible. That
way those boys who are required to enroll in PE can
take something they will enjoy and that will carry over
into later life. We started on that this year by throwing
out all the PFC tests for sophomores. |\We want to have
small groups of specialized instruction; for example, Mr.
Twombly teaches golf and Mr. Canfield, tennis.

We want to make the program more interesting,
and we will be able to do more along this line when
we haev more varied facilities . . .

INTERVIEWER: So then, the new gym will increase
the of the physical education program?
CORRIGAN: Oh sure, that's what we envision, For
example, we'd like to see a boy who scored low on his
PFI tests with the aid of a trainer be able to build
himself up considerably if he wanted to do so.

INTERVIEWER: What is your overall impression of
our intramural program?

CORRIGAN: | have not seen it in operation for a full
year, so I really don't know, Again, the new building
will make intramurals better, It’s got to, we'll have more
to offer, Of course, it will be up to the fraternities to
decide just what they want to do. . . but it has always
been a good program here.

INTERVIEWER: Has the overall athletic program ful-
filled your expectations so far?
CORRIGAN: Well, | don’t think it can be in this build-
ing. let's put it that way. But it has otherwise.

We'd like to feel that we have the athlete sub-
jected to all the finer things we have to offer.

One disappointment has been the size of some of
the squads. We have the capacity to handle a much
larger number than actually turn out. But numbers
would be the only disappointment

INTERVIEWER: Outside the physical changes, do you

see the need for any specific other changes in the im-
mediate future?

CORRIGAN: The major item is recruitment, we hope
io get our alumm more involved. Recruiting just in
Virginia goes against the grain of Washington and Lee,
for WAL is a4 national institution. We plan to contact
alumni all over the country, because we want to main-
tain our tradition of having our teams composed of
boys from diverse regions

Everything looks better now than it did two years
igo, but this has nothing to do with me at all. And
facilities do play a major role. | think we'll have a
better advantage in the years to come with a few gym
golf-course, and swimming pool

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Centre grinds Generals

By Mike Berry
Assistant Sports Editor

The third weekend in college foot-
ball’s centennial year saw many
interesting matchups. Various teams
across the nation got into the meat
of their schedules. Purdue found
that it may have played a possible
Rose Bowl opposite in its one point
decision over Stanford; Kentucky
found that its luck had run out as
Auburn set the Bluegrass boys back
44-3 and Saturday night, in the
midst of combo parties and gator
piles, Alabama and = Mississippi
matched off in one of the most
spectacular offensive displays in
college football history as Alabama
once again proved it has a team to
beat.

But before any of these games
were Over, most of us knew that the
Generals of W&L had suffered a

heartbreaking setback at the hands
of the Centre College Colonels. The
game for the most part was a stale-
mate as both teams seemed to be
able to hold one another in check,
The Colonels managed to grab the
lead in the second quarter on a 95
yard drive climaxed by Steve Kai-
ser’s one yard run for the score.
rhe first-half ended with the Gen-
erals down 7-0,

The Generals came out after in-
termission and drove 57 yards on
the excellent running of JoJo Mar-
tin and Doug Gossmann. The game
seemed to be a standoff from that
point but Centre capitalized on sev-
eral bad breaks by the Generals, and
were able to drive in for the decid-
ing touchdown midway through the
fourth quarter.

The Generals had trouble all day
and were particularly hampered by

Sports in General

W&L vs.

By John Robinson

After a month of intercollegiate
competition only one of W&L’s
teams has emerged undefeated. That
team is the varsity soccer team
which lays claim to a 3-0 record,
Despite wide margins in each con-
test, Coach Joe Lyles is quick to
point out that, “None of the games
have been easy.”

With 12 freshmen on the club and
only 4 seniors, inexperience _ still
looms as the Generals’ biggest hur-
dle. But after three challenges have
been successfully turned back, Lyles
was gleeful to emphasize that, “The
younger boys are really hustling and
hanging in there. They work hard in
practices as well as in games and
make up for lack of experience with
dedication.

So far the statistics for the booters
have been impressive with a total of
13 goals scored in 3 games, while
only an average of .67 were scored
by their opponents, Summarizing the
figures: Don Belt leads the team

U. Va.

with 6 goals and 1 assist, captain
John Yow has 3 goals, next is David
Manson with a pair of scores and
3 assists, and freshman Tom Kamp-
fmuellar has racked up a goal along
with a brace of assists. Goalie Ken
Newman has had two shut-outs and
allowed only two balls into the nets.

At this moment the Generals have
a good deal of momentum going,
but Friday at 4:00 on Alumni Field
they face their toughest test to date.
The University of Virginia brings an
undefeated team to do battle in
Lexington. After scouting Virginia,
Coach Lyles commented, “They
have very good material, especially
at wing and halfback. On paper I'd
have to say they are a better team.”
However, W&L will have a good
chance to down the Cavaliers thanks
to their veteran defense and aggres-
sive young offense. A good turn-out
in support of the soccer team will
definitely help the Generals in their
bid to remain undefeated and hand
the Wahoos their first loss,

Booters maim Madson

Once again Madison College suf-
fered defeat at the hands of Wash-
ington and Lee's soccer squad. The
final score was a lop-sided affair at
6-0, as the season's record was boost-
ed to 3-0.

The foreign field was still wet in
the initial quarter as Don Belt fed
to David Manson who made the
nets dance with his shot from the
right side. In the second quarter
WAL gained a 2-0 halftime lead as

Manson passed to John Yow for a
score.

In the third quarter a penalty for
pushing was converted into a point
by Don Belt via a penalty kick. And
only moments later Don headed the
ball in, after an assist from Meade
Kampfmuellar. Belt’s third marker
in a row came on a cross play to
the left side. The final goal went to
freshman George Lantzas in the last
quarter.

Centre’s pass defense. Neither Kuhn
nor Baizley seemed to be able to
move the Generals through the air,
The bright spot of the afternoon was
the quick opener that the W&L line
and JoJo Martin managed to utilize
on the touchdown drive.

There is little need to deny that
the Generals are just about out of
the running for first place in the
CAC. The Colonels have already

defeated last year’s co-champions,
Southwestern, It will be a definite
upset if either Washington or Se-
wanee can beat the Colonels. Thus
the Colonels have a clear shot for
the championship. The Generals do,
however, have that outside shot and,
once again barring upsets, are a
shoe-in for second place.

The Generals go back on the road
this weekend as they visit another

Moratorium letter

| would still be writing on the 15th,
and 2) my stomach couldn't stand
another re-reading. | will, however
sketch the projected Moratorium
program as it now stands. On the
morning of October 15th, a
of talks will be given in Lee Chapel

Ihe following people have graci-
ously consented to speak: Mr.
Charles Sweezy, minister of the
Lexington Presbyterian Church, Pro
fessors Loesel and Colvin of the
political science department, Dean
Sprunt, University Chaplin, Dr.
Pemberton of the Philosophy de-
partment, and a representative of the
John Birch Society. In addition, a
speaker is presently being sought
from VMI to explicate the military
point of view on the war. I believe
it is evident from the above that an
honest and intense effort has been
made to solicit all points of view
Never has there been an attempt (as
Mr. McConnell states in his article
“To sleep, Perchance to Cut?”) to
exclude or silence anyone.

The afternoon is to be left open
for partisan activities, (pro-war,
anti-war, or what-you-will); and a
Free Concert is being organized for
the evening which will, hopefully, re
unite the community with an aware
ness that, though our policy sugges-
tions differ, we are together in our

Ihe foregoing is an honest and
accurate disclosure of the Morator-
ium plans. I swear this by the New
York Mets (and anything else that
is still sacred). I have no idea how
the Friday R-t-P came by its “facts”
Having been involved in organiza
tional activities for the Moratorium
from their inception, | know that
neither Lawrence McConnell! nor
Walt Potter has been present at any
such gathering. Furthermore, on
only one occasion (to the best of
my knowledge) did the Friday R--P
interview anyone involved in the
Moratorium effort. On that occasion

Peter Zimmerman and I were ap
proached by a staff reporter who
clearly received, twice (once from

each of us) all pertinent data con
cerning the 15th. This interview fur
nished, I take it, the substance of
the articles. Anyone can see by sim
ple comparison with the above that
somewhere between note pad and

press, the simple associations of
time-<date-event became ludicrously
garbled

The Vietnam War has a shatter
ing effect on each of us both public
ly, as members of a society bitterly
fragmented by a long and draining
conflict, and privately, as individ
uals pressed by disruption and death
in our lives. It seems to me that it is
our duty as citizens to be continu
ally questioning our own
tions, continually re-examining the
evidence, in search of
our National Dilemma. I believe the
planned for October 15
afford us an excellent opportunity to
do just this—together. It
possible that in the common under
taking of that day, we will feel our
selves to be countrymen rather than
liberal, conservative, of of the
thousand things we call ourselves

effect, each house must write a plan
which must be passed by at least
75% of the members, These plans

has passed its plan, the plan must
then be approved by both the IFC
