Huntley calls
for action on
development

President Huntley dwelled upon
planned physical improvements yes-
terday in his annual opening assem-
bly address to the student body.
While declining to comment upon
the ground breaking date for any of
the new buildings, he assured the
students and faculty that plans were
well under way and in one instance
complete.

In reference to the date work
would start on the addition to Dore-
mus Gym, Huntley said that he
would not make any definite predic-
tion but that it would very likely be
completed before all of the students
in the assembly were graduated. The
plans for the proposed addition were
unveiled last spring. Huntley also
said that plans for a new library.
law school, and dorms to be situated
across the ravine were nearing com-
pletion. He also announced that Mc-
Cormick Library would probably be
renovated for use by the School of
Commerce.

President Huntley declared that
fund raising campaigns were going
very well, but that extra help would
always be appreciated. As of last
spring about one third of the funds
for the Doremus addition had been
raised,

Student Center dedication set

By Lex McMillan
Associate News Editor
Fhe weekend of October 4 will
see the dedication of the long needed
and awaited Student Union. The
classes of 1924, 1934, 1939, 1949

Passavant and Tyler appointed,
'69 Grads join administration

Iwo members of Washington and
Lee’s 1969 graduating class were
appointed to University administra-
live positions this past summer John
E. “Jay” Passavant, last year's Stu-
dent Body President was appointed
as assistant to the Director of Ad-
missions, and William C. Tyler was
appointed Assistant Director of De-
velopment. The moves were in line
with what the administration hopes
will be a regular program to bring
the views and capabilities of young
graduates annually into at least a
year's service to the University.

With regard to the first of the
appointments, that of Passavant,
President Huntley said, “We hope
we will be able each year to bring
an outstanding member of the senior
class—not necessarily the student
government president—into a year's
internship in administrative work.”

The appoiniments came just
shortly after graduation. Passavant
was appointed on June 18, and Tyler
the following day. Both appoini-
ments were made effective as of
July 1.

Passavant’s duties include making
extensive visits to secondary schools
and interviewing candidates for ad-
mission, as well as assisting in other
general admissions work. Tyler has
as his special responsibility the di-
rection of the University’s annual

giving programs, including the
alumni fund and the parents fund.
He will also assist Farris P.
Hotchkiss, Director of Development,
in general development work,

As well as holding the Student
Body Presidency, Passavant was the
first student ever to represent the
student body before the Board of
Trustees. A Dean's List student, he
was a member of WAL’s track team,
and served as President of the Fel-
lowship of Christian Athletes. Pas-
savant was President of Pi Kappa
Alpha social fraternity.

Tyler was a Dean's List student
at WAL. He was a member of the
Dance Board, Chairman of the
Young Republican Community Ser-
vice and house manager of Beta
Theta Pi social fraternity.

Literary magazine
to organize staff

An organizational meeting of
Ariel, the student literary magazine,
will be held Wednesday night at 9:00
p.m. in room 212 at the student cen-
ier. Anyone interested in working on
this year's staff should plan to ai
tend this important meeting. Fresh-
men are especially invited.

Ariel is published four times per
year and contains student literary
endeavors.

and 1964 will have the opportunity
to participate in the ceremonies.
That weekend will be a reunion for
these classes, as well as Homecoming
Weekend.

The new center is a $750,000 re-
novation and addition to an already
existing two story building which
had served as the Student Union.
Phe main new construction consisted
of a one story structure joining the
Dining Hall with the original struc-
ture.

The two chief crowd gathering
features of the Center will be its
tavern and the recreation room. The
tavern is decorated in dark wood
paneling with mahogany floors. This
is contrasted by a red and blue bur-
lap wall decor. The tavern sports a
long bar which will be serving near-
beer, and possibly wine. There will
also be a grill serving short order
items. The floor space is quite large
and seating consists of tables and

dark wood booths.

Downstairs is the recreation room
in which are located pool tables,
ping-pong tables and card tables. All
facilities are free except for the pool
tables which are rented at a minimal
charge of $1.00 per hour per table.
The recreation room is all carpeted
as is most of the rest of the center.

Some of the other facilities in-
clude two T.V. rooms. the E. €
room, and numerous meeting rooms.
There is also a comfortable library
and a small chapel. The music de-
partment and the glee club have
moved inio rooms located in the
lower level of the center. Dean
Sprunt has also moved into a new
office located in the building. An-
other feature of the new facility is
the large reception room handsomely
decorated in a French Provincia!
theme.

Ihe hallways throughout the cen-

ter are displaying a great deal of
student art work,

The Student Union is operated by
students under the Work/Study pro-
gram and is headed by Mr. Ken
Lane. It is open from noon until
midnight.

 

Number 1

EC supports counselors’
conventional dress stand

President Swede Henberg called
the first Executive Committee meet-
ing of the year to order last night
in their new meeting room in the
student center. All members of the
committee were present.

Seated at the center of the new
semicircular conference table, Hen-
berg first instructed that the chair-
men of the standing committees file
all reports, decisions or resolutions
concerning actions of their respective
committees in the EC office. Hen-
berg then announced his appoint-
ment of senior representative Dave
Bethea to be the student representa-
tive to the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee,

John Bernard, chairman of the
Student Control Committee, report-
ed that the first weekend of having
girls in the dorms was successful
without infraction of the rules.

John Miller, chairman of the
Assimilation Committee, requested
the Executive Committee to alter the
name of his group to the University
Center Committee. Miller cited as
reasons the joint efforts already
made this year between his com-
mittee and Ken Lane, the director
of the Center, and the fact that the
committee has nearly completed its
“assimilation” duties for the com-
ing year. The EC decided to take
action on Miller’s request ai a future

IFC convenes first meeting

The IFC voted last night 18-0 to
reinstate the weekly three-hour con-
structive work weeks for freshmen
pledges during the first semester.
Work weeks as well as pledge ha-
rassmeni were outlawed last semester
after recommendation from the
faculty.

The three hour work week is in
addition to the one hour of pledge
education now allowed as legitimate
pledging exercises during the first
semester. Bill McKelway introduced
a motion to allow fraternities to
initiate after the mid-semester fe-
ports in November. This motion was
defeated.

Larry Honig introduced a motion
to donate $100 per fraternity to
Swimin 70, a project to build a
municipal pool for the Lexington
area citizens. The Doremus pool is
the only pool that is now available
for the Lexington public. This mo-
tion was tabled until next week to
allow the fraternity representatives
to consult their respective houses.

Chuck Cahn, IFC president, an
nounced a deadline of Wednesday
at 6 p.m. for the filing of rush com-
plaints. They must be given either
to Cahn or John Phillips, the IFC
rush chairman. Cahn also warned
the fraternities to keep all mafri-
juana smoking out the fraternity
houses.

nomnalions

Cahn announced that
ties must have their

for Homecomings Queen in by the
next Monday meeting along with a
rough sketch of the Homecoming
display. Cahn also plans to have the
2nd annual freshman shoe race.

Newspapers need

of the Ring-tum Phi are in need of
interested students who would like

to work on either staff. There are
several positions open on both
papers. Freshmen are particularly

encouraged to apply for positions.
There are positions open for photo-
eraphers and developers. All equip-
ment except for a camera is furnish-
ed—excellent darkroom facilities are
available. There are also openings
for sportswriters, reporters, news-
writers, and feature writers. There
will be an organizational meeting
for the Tuesday staff this Friday at
5 p.m. and for the Friday staff Tues-
day evening at 5 p.m. Any interested

vich (Tuesday) or Bob Enizminger
(Friday).

NOTICES
Siena Delta Chi will hold an
election meeting in Reid 203, to-
night at 7:30 p.m. All journalism
majors, students with career plans
in the field, and active members are
urged to attend.

date since a constitutional amend-
ment would be necessary.

Vice-President Joe Tompkins
opened debate on the issue of con-
ventional dress in the dining hall.
Tompkins pointed out that the
dormitory counselors desired a
policy statement by the EC. (The
counselors voted 14-6 at a recent
meeting in favor of enforcing the
dress code in the dining hall.) The
last time the Executive Committee
issued a statement on this matter
was early in the Passavant admini-
stration.

Law representative Phil Thompson
moved that the EC adopt the resolu-
tion: “The Executive Committee
supports the dormitory cotnselors
in encouraging freshmen to wear
conventional dress in the dining
hall.” Kevin Baker seconded the
motion, which passed 8-0 with
Kumpuris and Henberg abstaining.

In final action, junior representa-
tive Staman Ogilvie was reappointed
for the second year to study the
feasibility of an independent exami-
nation schedule. Ogilvie did a con-
siderable amount of study in this
area last year.

The Executive Committee is now
accepting applications for the posi-
tion of Interim Chairman of the
1972 Mock Convention. Any stu-
dent may apply, but sophomores
are especially encouraged to do so.
Applications should be submitted to
Chuck Dobbins at the Beta house
before 6 p.m., October 6.

Phi Psis move into new
facility after twenty

years advance planning

The brothers of Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity, Virginia Beta Chapter, at
Washington and Lee are enjoying
the results of advance planning.

Twenty years ago, the house
members foresaw the need to erect
a structure built especially for the
purpose of being a fraternity house,
to replace an old mansion which the
Phi Psis had purchased from WA&L
in 1938 for $8,000.

In October, 1949, a letter went
out to alumni from Charles Gilmore
of Pittsburgh, temporary chairman
of the House Building Fund, an-
nouncing a goal of $100,000 to pro-
vide the needed facility.

As the 1969-70 academic year
began this month, the members of
Phi Kappa Psi are occupying an at-
tractive new chapter house on the
site of the old house at 301 East
Washington Street.

Gilmore noted that during the 20
year campaign, rising construction
costs made the original $100,000 fig
ure insufficient. The university made
a low-interest loan of $60,000 to the
fraternity toward completion of the
project, and efforts are continuing to
raise additional funds from alumni.
Gilmore said the total cost is ex-

pected to be approximaiely $175,000

264 have pledged after Rush Week 1969

Another hectic rush week has end
ed and the race is over. This years
results are listed below. The number
pledging a fraternity is 264. This is
somewhat less than the standard
which is usually close to 80% of the
class. The pledge range in
size from 22 for the SAE’s to 3 for
the Kappa Sigs. There are several
other pledge classes that run a close
second to the leading SAE’s

The following list shows the of
ficial listing of the pledge classes.

ferential ecards of the freshmen

A university center

Just a quick stroll through and a brief glance at the elabor-
ate furnishings of the newly opened student center are enough
to make one feel proud of Washington and Lee. But more
important than the beautiful decor of the center is the long-
needed service it will provide the University.

Washington and Lee has long been in need of a true
center for cultural and recreational activities. The $750,000
Early-Fielding Memorial Building provides the facility for
such a center. The new building offers a game room with
pool, card, and ping-pong tables; a comfortable tavern large
enough to seat 150 people, in which beer and food will be
served; office space for student organizations; color-television
lounges; a chapel, large conference rooms; and a luxurious
library featuring paperbacks and magazines. Mr. Kenneth
Lane, a recent graduate of W&L, will be the director of the
center and in that capacity act as adviser to a student com-
mittee which will provide leadership for center programs. As
we have already discovered, his office door is open to any stu-
dent.

With this major physical improvement, the administra-
tion has superbly played its role in fulfilling another need of
the University community. We earnestly hope that the stu-
dent body will now play its role in taking advantage of the
facilities provided. For only in this way will the new University
Center be just that—a true center.

Number 64 and rising

While we are in the process of mentioning items that are a
source of pride to the University, we would like to point out a
trend about which we may all be justly proud.

For the past several years Washington and Lee has con-
tinued to rise in rank among the nation’s colleges and uni-
versities in average faculty compensation. In a recent survey
of more than one thousand institutions of higher learning
taken by the American Association of University Professors,
W&L ranked 64th in faculty compensation.

In 1967 the University ranked 101st. In 1968 W&L
moved up to 83rd. Last year, we reached 64th with an average
compensation of full-time faculty members of $14,791.

W&L now ranks ahead of many private liberal arts col-
leges of similar size and purpose. We proudly agree with
President Huntley in his statement: “This is certainly one of
the most important aspects of maintaining high quality at the
University.”

Swimln ’70

Washington and Lee is more than just an island existing
within the borders of Lexington, it is a part of Lexington.
Most of the time we are all aware of this distinction, Oc-
casionally, we demonstrate this awareness. At Christmas, for
example, many of the fraternities demonstrate this awareness
by sponsoring parties for Lexington children. Only one camp-
us organization, the University Federation of Concern, de-
votes more than occasional time to the Lexington community.

However, at this moment a fine opportunity avails itself
in which the fraternities especially could make a significant
contribution other than the noise of combos to Lexington. A
group of Lexington citizens has embarked on a fund raising
campaign dubbed “SwimIn 70.” Their aim is to collect
$60,000 to finance the construction of an outdoor municipal
swimming pool, bath house, sun deck and wading pool by
next spring.

Before two years ago, Lexington children had no access
to any swimming pool. For the past two summers however,
W&L has opened the Doremus pool to Lexington. The use
of the indoor pool has been a successful but only temporary
solution to a recreation problem. The outdoor pool would
more effectively fill the gap in the city’s summer recreation
program.

Surely a small cash donation of $100 per fraternity to the
drive would go a long way in meeting the $60,000 goal, and
it would certainly be long remembered.

The Tuesday edition

An old friend warned us over the summer that the days
of fish coming gift-wrapped in Ring-tum Phis at local markets
are not gone yet. We hope they are. In the coming year we
will do our best to see that they are.

This is and will be a student newspaper. Any student is
free—and encouraged—to contribute to the Tuesday Edition.
For our part, we will endeavor to bring to light student opi-
nion on all issues from all angles. Editorials will express the
opinion of the editor-in-chief. Other articles on page two will
relay the opinions of their authors and not necessarily the
opinion of the newspaper. oe

We will endeavor to be as objective as possible in our cov-
erage of news and sports. We will also do our best to publish
total coverage of events relating to W&L.

Our only major innovation regarding content will be the
publication of classified advertising. This is a service long:
needed and long-overlooked by the Ring-tum Phi. Students
may purchase space in the paper on page four at the rate of
three lines for fifty cents.

Your criticism or support in the coming year is equally
welcome.

 

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Faculty active in public service

Washington and Lee University
faculty members were involved in a
wide range of local, state and na-

Mr. Robert Altshuler is on camp-
us for two weeks this fall to deliver
a series of lectures under the general
topic “Acting is Playing”. Mr. Alt-
shuler initiates a mew program by
the Troubadour Theatre designed to
introduce University students to
members of the professional theatre.
Through lectures and workshops
they will explore such phases of pro-
fessional theatre as movement, voice,
directing, and design.

Altshuler, a professional stage
manager, received his training at the
Herbert Berghof Studio in New
York. He has since worked at many
theatres around the country, most
notably the Seattle Repertory Thea-
tre and the American Conservatory
Theatre in San Francisco. Mr. Alt-
shuler has done summer theatre
work with the Stanford Summer Fes-
tival, the Revinia Summer Festival
in Illinois, and the Alleghany Players
in Pennsylvania. In 1968 he was
nominated for a Ford Foundation
Grant.

Included in Mr. Alishuler’s series
will be lectures on theatre games,
improvisations, and characterization.
In addition Mr. Altshuler will hold
individual conferences with those
who are interested.

The lecture series is open to the
University. Those interested in
workshops with Mr. Altshuler are
asked to contact Mr. Lee Kahn at
the Troubadour Theatre immedi-
ately.

There will also be an organiza-
tional meeting for all those interested
in theatre work tonight at the Trou-
badour Theatre. The series for the
year will be discussed and auditions
for the first play, “The Homecom-
ing” will be announced. Other plays
in the Troubadour season will be
Shakespeare's “King Lear” and the
recent broadway musical, “Hair”, if
the rights to the play can be ob-
tained. The last play in the season
has not yet been announced, but in
the past two years the last produc-
tion of the year has usually been
written by a student.

Anyone interested in working in
any capacity for the theatre is in-
vited to attend the meeting at 7:30
tonight in the theatre.

Diversity found
in this year’s
freshman class

Washington and Lee’s freshmen
this year arrive boasting an overall
impressive statistical profile. The
class is composed of 364 young men
from 34 states and six foreign coun-
tries. This wide geographical span
is indicative of the overall student
body and the University’s desire to
prevent being grooved as a southern
school.

The class of ’73 arrived a week
early to attend the 38th annual
Freshman Camp at Natural Bridge.
That three day orientation began on
September 9 and was followed in
three days by the confusing ritual of
rush,

The strong national representation
of the new class is led by Virginia
contributing 60 members. Virginia
is followed by Maryland running a
close second with 41 students. These
forerunners are followed by New
York with 29; Texas, 21; Florida
and Ohio, 18 each; Georgia with 17;
North Carolina, 16; Pennsylvania,
16; New Jersey, 15; South Carolina
and Tennessee, 13 apiece; and Ken-
tucky, 10. Another 21 states each
supply nine or fewer entering men.
The Bahamas, Canal Zone, Chile,
Jamaica, Switzerland and Uruguay
each furnish one apiece.

The ever-increasing role of finan-
cial aid at W&L is evident in the
freshman class. A total of 91 mem-
bers of the class are receiving aid
ranging from $150 to $3,000 for the
session.

The great majority of the students
are public school graduates with
30% having been graduated from
private or preparatory schools, This
reflects another trend at W&L of
more public school students as op-
possed to a past of a larger percent-
age of private school students,

 

 

Broadway Joe at W&L?

By DAVID HIGGINS
Columnist

The name Joe Namath has ap-
peared in every sports section of
every newspaper in America, and
Namath’s picture has been the cover
on many national magazines with a
feature article inside to match. The
name Broadway Joe has come to
stand for a new breed of national
hero—the super athlete with the
super social life. This combination
of muscle and madness is unique on
the national level, but we here at
Washington and Lee should be quite
familiar with the style of the man
called Broadway Joe.

While Washington and Lee has no
Joe Namaths in the super athlete
sense, she does have many athletes
who are of the style which is brought
to mind by the nickname Broadway
Joe. The nationally unique combina-
tion of muscle and madness is com-
mon fare on the W&L campus and
some WAL athletes probably excel
even Joe in the realm of the super
social life.

Of course no one here professes
openly to being a Broadway Joe—
that would be not only conceit but
also reason to question your serious-
ness as an athlete. But the fact re-
mains that Joe's style is definitely
here and has been for many years.
WAL athletes take their sport quite
seriously but taken equally as serious
is their right to a social life. No
one here has to worry about selling
stock options in a bar, but many
of us have to worry about what our
Pete Rozelle will say if we go down

the road on Friday nights. And while
we may not weep on national tele-
vision, many W&L athletes have
been known to leave sports when
they thought the game interfered
with an equally important part of
their lives.

Broadway Joe should not be a
unique type of person to us. Admit-
tedly none of us are at his level of
proficiency, but we all must feel
good to see a man of our style suc-
ceed. And if anyone from another
school asks why our teams don’t al-
ways win, you can ask him in all
honesty what he expects from a team
full of Broadway Joes.

Generals had possibly taken the
ligers too lightly since it was their
first varsity season. Like most state
colleges, however, Towson managed
to pad its locker room with some
notable junior college athletes and
fielded an exceptional team.

Many General doubtfuls managed
to peform exceptionally well Satur-
day. Among them were fullback
Doug Gossmann and right end Steve

good and Towson went into the
locker room at halftime with a 7-7

As was expected, the Tigers came
out as an inspired unit in the sec-
ond half. They proceeded to score
their second touchdown and muff
the decisive extra point.

Early in the fourth quarter W&L

While we're on the subiect, I think
something should be said about the
upcoming game. Randolph-Macon is
one of the better teams that W&L
will meet all year. They were last
year’s small college champs with a
9-0) record and lost virtually no
players. They play explosive ball and
able to come up with the big play at
any time. They are picked to re-
peat last year’s performance and
are a pre-season favorite to once
again win the siate small college
championship. The word from all
over the state is that ther is only
one serious threat to their drive.
That threat rests in Lexington, Vir-
ginia and calls Wilson Field its
home. If you still don’t know who
I'm talking about, it’s the Generals
of Washington and Lee. They belong
to a certain group of students who
go to classes on the WAL campus.
1 think. But of course you wouldn't
know it. Most of the time there are
very few of the students in the
stands. We as students should get
out and support WAL athletic
teams. The teams and coaches de-
serve it and it's a great boost to
school spirit and school unity. Go
ahead and get plastered before you
come over—if that's the only way
you can stand the game. Get out
there somehow and support them.
Like I said it’s your team. Razz the
officials, storm the field, insult the
opponents, Do your thing baby;
whatever turns you on. WAL fans
need a revival and there are enough
good home games this year to really
give us something to yell about yet
not take away all of our energy.
WAL has got the team; let's give it
the support it needs, I'll see you
Saturday at the best game of the

season
