LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, OCTOBER 14, 1969

 

Martha and the Vandellas will appear Saturday night in Doremus Gym,

penings set for Gym

Once again Doremus Gym has

been called back into service for a

Washington and Lee Dance week-
end. Both Friday and Saturday

nights will see the gym overflowing
with the usual collection-partying
students and their dates. The Paul
Butterfield Blues Band will be the
featured attraction Friday night
while Saturday night will find W&l
soul afficionados entertained by the
Motown Revue; Martha Reeves and
the Vandellas 100%. In addi-
tion. the Kallabash Corporation has
been contracted to provide the sound
for the University cocktail party
Friday afternoon in Red Square
Both concerts are scheduled to start
at & p.m. The cocktail party will be-
gin at 4 p.m

Reason for the shift back to Dore
was a breakdown in negotia
tions with VMI. Originally, the
Dance Board had planned to hold all
of this year’s concerts in the VMI
Ficld House, but an inability to
make afrangemenis satisfactory to
both sides resulted in Openings be
ing shifted back to Doremus. At pre
sent, Dr. Phillips of the Economics

Martha and the Vandellas have
become one of the hottest record-
ing acts in the nation. Indeed, they
are one of the top properties of Mo-
town Record Corporation where
every group under contract ranks as
an internationally acclaimed head-
line act.

In Detroit, their hometown, Mar-
tha Reeves and the Vandellas are
easily cited as perennial Motown
Sound favorites.

Their status is continuously be
ing enforced as was evidenced when
they recorded their first live album,
Martha and the Vandellas Live!, at
one of Detroit's leading nightclubs

Good things seem to come in
three’s for the trio, who have had
three trips abroad—twice on tours
of England and once around the
European concert circuit. They had
been organized the same number of
years prior to their tremendous take
off.

Since that hit, “Come and
Get These Memories”, Martha
Reeves and the Vandellas have fol
lowed up with “Heat Wave (a
Grammy Award nominee), “Dane
ing in the Street”, “Quicksand”, “My
Baby Loves Me”, “Ready for Love’,
“Jimmy Mack”, “Love Bug
My Heart Alone’, and their
recent release, “Honey Chile”

lead singer Martha Reeves and first
soprano Rosalind Ashford have been

singing together since joining the
same community center as young-
sters.

Friday nights attraction, the But-

IFC views parietal rules

after SAC rejects eight

The IFC concerned itself mainly
last night with the outlining of reg-
ulations necessary for application
for having girls in fraternity houses.
Iwelve petitions had been previously
submitted by individual fraternities:
three were rejected by the IFC Judi-
cial Board; one was handed in too
late to be considered by the IFC;
six were denied by the Student Af-
fairs Committee; and only two were
accepted,

During the course of the discus-
sion, Phi Ep president Lennie Par-
kins brought up the point that the
situation with girls in the fraternity
houses was similar to that in the
dormitories. He felt that since two
people were required in each house
to enforce the regulations concern-
ing girls that an equal restriction be
placed upon the dorms; he cited
the possibility of employing dorm
counselors for such a purpose. Dean

There was a good showing of area
colleges. Wake Forest made the
best showing with their four man
team winning 6 of 8& debates. The
remaining awards were divided
among U.Va., Richmond, W&M
and Randolph-Macon. Teams were
also present from Catholic Univer-
sity, Roanoke College, Old Domi
nion, and Bridgewater College. In
all, 64 debaters were present com
prising 32 teams. This is the largest
debate tournament held ever at
Washington and Lee

Washingion and Lee's excellent
performance is indicative of their
abilities and a forecast of the kind
of year they will end up with

This coming Openings Weekend
our teams will travel to UNC for
the first major debate tournament
of the school year. One team will
consist of Tim Wright and John

Lewis G. John denied the idea that
an allusion could be drawn between
the dorms and the fraternities and
added that it would be too cumber-
some to consider such a plan for a
fraternity.

IFC president Chuck Cahn an-
nounced that the annual pledge shoe

ing the game this Saturday. Two
pledges from each house will meet
with him this Thursday at 6:30 p.m.
in the Student Center to formalize
plans.

Jay Wetsel, IFC secretary, then

discussed the bad attitudes which
fraternities were developing. He
cited the fact that irresponsibiilty

had grown considerably since last
year and was giving the fraternity
system a bad name. He then pushed
for enforcement of parietal restric-
tions, sO as to express the true re-
sponsibility of fraternities,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday, October 14, 1969

Why not be non-partisan?

During the past two weeks we have watched with keen in-
terest the developments that have taken place here concern-
ing October 15. At first, we were pleased; we believed every-
one would be respectful of the opinions of others. We thought
that maybe the program of events scheduled on October 15
would be non-partisan. We felt that possibly something posi-
tive and constructive would result. We hoped that neither
extreme, left nor right, would be unduly assertive. We prayed
that for just one day everyone could try to forget whether or
not he considered himself left, right, or somewhere in the
middle. We have been bitterly disappointed.

The Executive Committee, the faculty, and the October
15 Group (Messrs. Turner, Geyer, Zimmerman, Zucker, et
al.) did their best, or, we should say, the best they could do.
However, they committed, as we did, that historically fatal
mistake of putting too much confidence in those that fail to
use their brains enough, in those that fail to weigh the conse-
quences before acting. They placed too much trust in the
ability of others to rise above overt partisanship so that some-
thing of value could result here tomorrow.

The October 4 Richmond Times-Dispatch quoted Zim-
merman: “the real purpose of the day is to instill a communal
spirit of concern about the American involvement in the
war.” Geyer wrote in last Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi: “It seems

to me that it is our duty as citizens to be. .

. in search of a

solution to our National Dilemma. I believe the activities
planned for October 15 afford us an excellent opportunity
to do just this—together.” In his letter published in the Fri-
day Edition, Professor Zucker reiterated that the purpose of
the moratorium here is to provide a forum as a means of di-
recting thought toward an issue of national concern. How-
ever, he added that the afternoon would be open for peaceful
demonstrations for those who wished to protest either for or
against the war. Therein lies the tragedy of tomorrow.

It is too late to ask any but rhetorical questions. Why
leave the afternoon open to partisan activity (albeit to activity
from both sides in a vain attempt to be “non-partisan’’)?
Wouldn’t it have been far better to go to class in the morning
and schedule the lectures in the afternoon, than to open the
door for irresponsibility? As it is, any positive, bilateral, non-
partisan advantage mounted in the morning can easily be
lost amid emotions in the afternoon. Fortunately, responsible
and constructive alternatives will be provided otherwise for
those who desire to continue the morning’s spirit in the after-
noon. Discussion groups such as those being conducted by
Rev. Sweezy, Dr. Colvin, and Mr. Loesel, are open to those
who prefer to use their minds in lieu of their feet.

The aim of the moratorium is to channel thought and
direct attention on a non-biased rational basis, not to abort
these processes. We all should be well aware that the war in
Vietnam is a national disaster. The time for demonstration is
over. There is nothing more to prove. We must now locate

gain

solutions. What possible

can the leaders of tomorrow's

“peace parade” hope to derive? All their action will do is
build-up an atmosphere of hostility—and we are not idly
prognosticating from an isolated office, plans for counter
marches have already been made—and what can be accom-
plished in an air of hostility? Hostility, or confrontation or
whatever word one chooses to call it, is a far cry from dispas-
sionate objective study and thought. It is miles away—miles
only your feet will lead you along.

Like Mr. Geyer, we too were foolish enough to believe
that maybe for once in this heady national debate, some peo-
ple could join hands in search of a solution. And so, perhaps,
we will cooperate and think. But for how long? Two or three
artificial hours tomorrow morning before we split up. Before
we forget what we learned and before we forget how to think
as we walk out of Lee Chapel down the right or the left aisle?

Washington, D.C

Mr. President:

On January 11, 1968, you address-
ed our community in the following
manner: “America needs the vision,
the dissent, the constructive action
this generation can provide for in
the years ahead,” In the year and a
half since those remarks were made
you acceded to the nation’s highest
office. and it is with greatest confid-
ence in your continued dedication to
those principles of vision, dissent,
and constructive action, that we
write to you today,

Our appeal is not that of a con
glomerate of polarized political en-
tities advocating or opposing escala-
tion or deescalation of the war. In-
stead, we offer our opinion to you
is Americans, united in our concern
with the policy as it currently
stands, seeking only to be heard

We, the undersigned, are members

of the Lexington, Virginia com-
munity, It is our hope that in 1969,
us President of the United States,
you will not ignore our dissatisfac-
tion with our nation’s current policy

regarding Viet Nam.

This is a copy of the letier-petition
that will be circulated throughout
Lexingion on Tuesday and Wednes
day of this week and delivered to
the President on Thursday, the six

By Mack Woodward
Editorial-Page Editor

The local history of Rockbridge
County played an important part
in the history of the nation. Many
families famous in Virginia as well
as American history lived in this
area in the earlier years of this
country. Many of the prominent
families kept extensive files of diar-
ies and letters, as well as ledgers
and other business papers. Descen-
dents today of these families, realiz-
ing the value of these papers, de-
cided to donate the papers to in-
stitutions where they may be of use
to scholars and researchers.

Many of these papers have been
donated to McCormick Library. In-
cluded in the collection in the ar-
chives are papers of Daniel Boone,
“Light Horse” Harry Lee, George
Washington, James Monroe, John
Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, James
Madison, and Robert E. Lee.

The problem that the library ar-
chives faces is the organization of
this material, While the documents
fill two large rooms on the second
floor of the library, they are in very

How a

By Bill Melthany
(Editor's Note: The opinions ex-
pressed in these articles are not
necessarily those of the Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi.)

Few are aware that an official
U.S. Government investigation in
Congress, which was published and
is available (the content of which
was summarized with additional
evidence by Gary Allen in the lead
article, “The Vietniks”, which ap-
peared in the January, 1966 issue
of American Opinion,) revealed that
the date, October 15th, since 1965
has been a day of internationally-
organized protest for the Commun-
ists and their dupes worldwide. In
America, October 15, 1965, marked
violence at numerous campuses
which fell victim to the Maoist
Vietnam Day Committee. The fact
that the International Communist
Conspiracy has directed these de-
monstrations against the war in
Vietnam is so well known that this
has mistakenly led many Americans
to believe the Reds are really un-
happy about American policy there.

In spite of the unfortunate fact
that Oetober 15th of this year was
chosen for a similar protest here at
WAL. the vast majority of those in-
volved on our campus are motivated
exclusively by the most sincere, yet
misguided, form of idealism, if cer-
tainly not by any accurate know-
ledge or understanding of the history
und workings of the Communist
Conspiracy or its operations in Viet-
nam.

The only serious problems involv
ed are these: A majority of students
at WAL took seriously their wition
which their parents paid and right-

fully expect classes to be held on
the Sth. Some “Right-wing extre-
mists. such as this writer, think

getting an education on that day is a
damn good idea

Ihe other problem is a lack of
knowledge about what has really
been going on in Vietnam. Too few
people on this campus know, for
instance, that it was the U.S. State
Department, through William Dono
van of the Office of Strategic Serv-
that provided the money for
vetting up the late (and sickeningly
venerated-by-the - “Liberal press}
Communit murderer Ho Chi Minh
in power in North Vietnam in 1945
Few know thai it was Henry Cabot
Lodge, then Col. Edward Lansdale

wer

loose order. Mr. Leach, librarian,
stated that there was “. . . no effec-
tive control over the total material.”

None of the documents in the
archives are indexed by subject;
some collections are cruaely indexed
by the addressee or by who wrote
them. Cross-indices are non-existant.
There are name indices to most of
the important manuscript collections.
Most of the work that has been
done was done by Mrs. Henry Sloss
last year and by Dr. Crenshaw over
the last few years while doing re-
search for his book.

The conditions in the archives
section are far less than desirable
for old documents, The papers are
stacked in boxes, in grocery sacks,
and on the floor. The rooms are hot
and stuffy; ideally, the temperature
should be around 70 degrees and
the humidity around fifty per cent.
The worst enemies of these older
documents are dust, humidity, and
extreme temperatures.

Several people in the Lexington
community are aware of the con-
tents and potential finds in the li-
brary. Matt Paxton, Jr., who did re-

Bircher

and various C.LA. operatives who
were responsible in the early and
mid-1950's for betraying the anti-
Communist French Army and quiet-
ly enabling the Communist Viet
Minh to enslave half of Vietnam:
and destroying the power of and
eventually exiling from South Viet-
nam the only solidly anti-Communist
groups there: The Emperor Bao Dai,
Pope Pham cong Tac and the three
million members of the Cao Dai
religious sect, the smaller two-mil-
lion-member Hao Hao sect, and the
Binh Huyen army under the leader-
ship of General Le van Vien; and
the installation of and later assassi-
nation of Ngo dinh Diem — a typi-
cal indication of whose background
can be gained from the fact that
his, President Diem’'s, brother, Ngo
dinh Nhu, maintained a “labor or-
ganization” in the My Tho area of
South Vietnam which was practi-
cally indistinguishable from the
Communist Party there, and who, at
the same time, as “advisor to the
president”, controlled the army and
the police of the regime, and an un-
derground party of some 70,000
members which spent much of its
energy turning in denuncations of
anybody who was opposed to the
Ngo family. The most glamourous
member of that touchy family, Ma
dame Nhu, admitied freely about
two years ago in The New York
Times that she herself is, and al-
ways has been, a Communist, In
other words, since 1954, we haven't
had any genuine anti-Communist
bastion in South Vietnam to be de
fending. The whole story on the
above material is told in Hilaire du
Herners Background to Betrayal:
The Tragedy of Vietnam.

Few here at WAL know tha
everything we are currently and
have been doing in Vietnam—in

deed the very reason we got in Viet
nmam—is im accordance with our
treaty commitments in the S.ELA
1.0. organization, which is, accord
ing to two provisions of its own
charter, merely a regional branch of
the U.N. Because of this. the man
who heads the U.N.'s department
which is in charge of supervising ali
military actions of U.N. member
nations is actually the commanding
officer of all U.S. servicemen in
Vietnam. His name is Dr Leonid A
Rutakovy and he is U.N Under
Secretary General for Political and

search in the newspaper files and
family papers said he “, . . never
was able to find everything I was
looking for,” Mr. Paxton emphasiz-
ed that the archives could be more
useful as Rockbridge County was
part of one of the major routes
westward and the library no doubt
contained important documents deal-
ing with the westward movement.

Dr. Ollinger Crenshaw, who did
considerable research in the archives
section emphasized the need for
more effective cataloging of the ma-
terials as we are not certain just
what is in the library—and until
we do know what is in the library
the materials cannot be effectively
used,

The library no doubt contains
several documents more important
than those we know about, but if
they are not catalogued properly,
they may be in a state of total use-
lessness by the time funds are avail-
able to staff the archives. Until such
time that the archives is appropri-
ated more money, the documents
will rot as the new gymnasium is
built.

Security Council Affairs—the U.N.
“Military Secretary” according to
his duties as outlined in the U.N.
Charter. And he is a Soviet Com-
munist. Every man who has held
that key U.N. post has been a Soviet
Communist, It is he who first sees
and approves all orders coming
from the Pentagon and going to our
field commanders in Vietnam. You
need not believe me on this point
because you can get a letter from
the State Department which will
tell you how Comrade Leonid reads
and approves all Pentagon orders
before our men receive them. This
helps to explain the many ambushes
of our forces in Vietnam by the

Korea, because of our membership
in the Communist-dominated U.N.,

Vietnam, and because we are fight-

trol, the Communists are actually

What's bugging
the forgotten
American now?

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

A cover story in the October 6
issue of Newsweek entitled “The
Troubled American: A Special Re-
port on the White Majority” is one
of the finest analytical studies ever
presented by a magazine. The arti-
cle is a must reading for anybody
who wants to know what is really
happening in the United States to-
day.

Through extensive research, and
with the aid of the Gallup Poll,
Newsweek asks, and answers, the
simple question; “What's bugging
John Doe.?” The article is enlight-
ening and distressing.

The Average American, some-
times called the Forgotten Ameri-
can, is the solid citizen, the back-
bone of our capitalist system, the
man who works on the assembly
line at General Motors and pumps
the gas at the corner service station,
the housewife and telephone opera-
tor. The Average American is many
things, but most of all he is pessi-
mistic. He is losing faith in the
United States.

Forty-six percent of the people
surveyed thought the country had
changed for the worse during the
1960's, while only 36 percent
thought it had improved, and 58
percent expect the country to worsen
during the 1970's, while only 19
percent expect improvement.

A general and sincere feeling of
frustration—with the Vietnam War,
with Negro demands, with crime
and civil disobedience, and with high
taxes — runs throughout Middle
America. The Average American
feels, and perhaps justifiably, that
he has been ignored in favor of
groups at the extremes of the econo-
mic scale—the privileged affluent
and people on welfare, both of
whom seem to benefit at his expense
in the current tax structure,

But the Average American will
not be ignored any longer. He is
using his majority status to register
his complaint at the ballot box.
Throughout the country, candidates
are appealing to the Average Ameri-
can, with successful results. Nowhere
is this more obvious than in New
York City, once the bastion of
American liberalism. Republican

than the above is the fact that the
United States Government is actu-
ally financing both sides of the war.
Not enough people know that we
are at war and that our enemy is
the total Communist bloc of nations.
Not enough people know that at
least eighty percent of the sinews of
war are being provided North Viet-
nam by Soviet Russia and its Euro-
pean satellites, Too few know that
this help to North Vietnam has been
made possible almost entirely by our
help to the Soviet Union and its
satellites.

It is not only true, as the Greeks
said, that one must eat before one
can philosophize; it is also true that
one must eat at least a certain mini-
mum of food, with a certain degree
of regularity, if one is to work on
the machines which turn out guns
in an armament factory. And it is a
further important truth that through-
out all history, as a general rule and
with only rare and temporary excep-
fons, people living in a communal
society of a completely socialistic
economy have been unable to feed
themselves. And with that in mind,

Some comments on this viewpoint

By Lex MeMillan

1 sincerely hope that if nothing
else Hilaire du Berrier’s “Back-
ground to Betrayal: The Tragedy of
Vietnam” is better written, more
understood and blessed with
shorter sentences than Mr. Bill Me-
Hhany's verbose tragedy appearing
on this page. Mr, Melthany has
thrown out a truckload of “facts”
which are supposed to prove some-
thing or the other. | really am not
sure what his point is. One of the
few conclusions | drew after read
ing and re-reading his article was
that we are surrounded by “dirty
Communists”, One really mind
blowing fact he skillfully proved was
that October 158 has been a tradi
tonal day of Communist protest
This startling effort took 13 lines
fobviously a witches’ plot)

Another nieresiing «aspect of
Melthany’s trivia is his benevolent
undersianding of the “vast majority
of those involved on our campus

motivated exclusively by the
most sincere, vet misguided, form of
His attitude is at the

easily

ilealiam

very least aggravating

In essence it seems that Melthany
has tried to make a very complex
matter out of a fairly simple event
which will occur Wednesday, Oct
1S. He charges that there “is a lock
of knowledge about what has really
been going on in Vietnam,” (the
truth will make you free) at the
same time resorting to cursing the
idea of not having classes on Oct
15. Ostober 15 would be the per-
fect time to enhance ones knowledge
of what is going on in Vietnam

The last half of his article con
tained three sentences, one of which
was almost beyond comprehension
I feel sure that one reason it was
dificult to understand is that I am
unfamiliar with the “facts” he was
slinging around, However, | fail to
see what difference whether or not
South Vietnam has had a non-com
munist government since 19054
makes on our desire to have a day
of concern, active dissent and learn
ing regarding Vietnam

Ask Hill Melthany to tell
the truth and set you free

Wash in gto nN and Lee Tuesday’s Players of the Week

tames H-S Tigers

By Mike Berry

Just about anywhere you go in
Virginia this time of year you will
find cool mornings, hot days, and
brilliant colors. Much to the joy of
a certain individual on the General
squad, this time of year is called
“Indian summer.” It's a time of
Homecomings, Tobacco bowls, road
trips, big football games, keg par-
ties, and combo parties. Hampden-
Sydney was having an Indian sum-
mer affair last Saturday afternoon,
but they had little to celebrate.

The Tigers had just emerged from
“death valley” after receiving the
brunt of a tremendous second-half
comeback by the Generals. Death
valley is the affectionate term that
has been assigned to the Tiger's
football field. So named because,
evidently, some poor sucker died of
heat exhaustion while playing there
on a mid-October afternoon.

Che Washington and Lee Generals
went into Saturday's game with
Hampden-Sydney as a six-point un-
derdog. The Generals played the
underdog role for the first-half of
Saturday’s action. They went into
the locker room at the half down
13-0,

Then the Generals came out after
the intermission and completely
dominated the game. The true turn-
ing point came when sophomore
Mark Skoggard broke through the
Hampden-Sydney line to block a
Tiger punt. From then on the game
belonged to W&L. The offense and

 

a

the defense played together as one
unit. When the offense needed the
ball, the defense got it. When the
defense needed points to protect,
the offense got them. The whole
team jelled.

Chuck Kuhn fired three beautiful
touchdown passes, in addition to
coming up with the big play when
it was needed. Bruce Green made
two of the three TD catches while
Steve Mahaffey made the other
clutch grab, Frank Stearns came up
with vital receptions; Andy Smith
did an exceptional job of filling in
for Staman Ogilvie (another stand-
out) while Ogilvie was out with a
leg injury. | could go on and on
about the great job the offense did,
but something must be said about
the defensive unit.

Ihe Kumpuris brothers, Jay Meri-
wether, Mike O'Donnell, Scott
Neese, David Laughlin, and the list
goes on and on, played above and
beyond the call of duty. They put
on a demoralizing rush and were
backed up by an excellent pass de-
fense. John Nolan came up with his
fourth and fifth interceptions of the
year, and was joined by Brooks and
Graham with one apiece. The Gen-
erals literally blasted their way to a
21-13 victory.

This week's game pits W&L
against Tufts College of Boston in
the NCAA centennial game. It’s a
home game and will provide an ex-
cellent Opportunity for everyone to
come out and see the Generals in
action.

U. Va. wins in soccer, 2-1

The soccer team suffered its first
setback of the year 2-1, but it took
Virginia two overtimes and a pair
of cheap goals to win

The first half saw no scoring but
plenty of action

With three minutes left in the
third quarter the Generals streaked
downfield. John Yow penetrated on
the left side and booted across the

field to Don Belt. Don was surround
ed and passed off to Carl Hyatt,
who boomed the ball into the nets

Virginia was stunned again when
the tables were turned in its favor
with 1:17 left in the game. An in
direct kick was awarded for pushing
from behind. From 30 yards out a
looping kick over the wall of Wash
ingion and Lee defenders was head
ed in. The goal could have possibly
have been a mental error as no play
ers picked up the unguarded man

With a tie score the game went
into a required set of five minute
overtimes, Washington and Lee was
simply trying to hold on with in
jured starters and little bench depth
Nothing evolved from the first over
time. The second overtime saw dis
ister as one of WAL's own players
booted the ball back into his own
goal in an atiempt to get it out of
bounds. With 1:06 left on the clock
the Generals could do little but

Cross Country team wins one
and loses one in Roanoke meet

Washington and Lee's cross coun-
try team went to Roanoke on Octo-
ber 11 with a win and a loss and
came back with two wins and two
losses. The result of a tri-meet was
Roanoke College 40, W&L 41, and
Old Dominion 42, The Generals
came up with their best statistical
performance to date, but it wasn’t
enough to overtake Roanoke.

The Generals were paced by Bob
Sherwood, who came in 4th with a
time of 23:39. He was closely fol-
lowed by Bill Wilkinson, Sth at
23:43 and Dave Haydu, 8th at 24:27,
Roanoke runners came in 2nd and
3rd, and Old Dominion held first
with a runner at 22:06.

Next meet is on October 24 at
Bridgewater against the Eagles.

we might turn our attention to a
dispatch from Poland, first carried
in Die Pomersche Zeitung of Ham-
burg, Germany, and then reprinted
on December 26, 1966 in the Chic-

ago Tribune. lt reads as follows:
“Weapons of the Polish armed
forces are being shipped from Stet-

harbors . . . While on one side of
the Stettin harbor American wheat
is being unloaded from freighters,
on the other side of the same har-
bor weapons are loaded which are
being used against American soldi-
ers... The Poles receive the wheat
(from the U.S.) on credit and they
in turn ship their weapons to North
Vietnam on credit.”
