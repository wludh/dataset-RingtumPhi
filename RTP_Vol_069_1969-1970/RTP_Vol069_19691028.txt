Baker is first,
Bruyere third
at La Salle

At La Salle College over the
week-end, Kevin Baker—Co-Cap-
tain of the W&L Debate Team—
was chosen the best speaker out of
104 debaters, representing nine
states and 32 colleges. Further, Bob
Bruyere, a freshman, debating in his
first varsity tournament, was chosen
the third best speaker. Baker and
Bruyere debating as a team won §
of 6 debates and finished in third
place as a team.

Bruyere, until he and Baker were
defeated by the Univ. of Mass, in
the semi-final championship round,
had never lost a college debate, hav-
ing won twelve straight in novice
tournaments at W&L and La Salle.
The Baker-Bruyere team received
three trophies at La Salle, more than
any other school participating.

This weekend, W&L will have
more debaters at more tournaments
than at any time in its history. Tim
Wright and John Reynolds, along
with Kenny Murov and Baker, will
go to Emory. An all freshman team
of Alan Prater and Bruyere as one
team and Larry Evans and Andy
Bradshaw, the latter two being also
at La Salle with a 2-3 record, will
go to the National Wake Forest No-
vice Tournament, while Charles
Smith, Bill Radigan, Cal Seaton, and
Mark Grobmyer will go to Susque-
hanna in Pennsylvania.

Henberg announces plan
for Building Fund Drive

By Steve Ory

The Executive Committee meeting
last night was plagued by faulty
fuses and pesky photographers. The
season opened with the swearing in
of freshman committeeman Alan
Prater and Law School freshman
committeeman John Markham.

Phil Thompson announced the re-
sults of the freshman Law School
elections. In addition to Markham’s
election to the EC, Stuart Hurt was
elected president, Steve Annand was
elected vice-president, Lock Hand-
ley was elected secretary, and Sam
Painter was elected treasurer.

Swede Henberg announced a Uni-
versity building fund drive which
is to begin within eighteen months
He appealed to the EC on behalf of
the administration for suggestions
for student involvement. The dis-
cussion was tabled and a committee
composed of Ogilvie, Tompkins, and
Azuma was formed to report sug
gestions at a later date.

Henberg also echoed complaints
from alumni that were forwarded to
him from last weekend's Alumni
conference. Henberg related that
many of the young alumni were dis
appointed by the admissions depart
ment's failure to use them in seek-
ing students for WAL. Dean Kum
puris said that he was working with
Dean Hotchkiss to remedy the situa
tion. The suggestion was made that
the Student Service Society be given

j IFC petitions faculty for

parietal control in houses

Last night’s IFC meeting saw the
beginning of several minor changes
in the IFC Constitution and By-laws
and the passing of a modified mo-
tion on parietals.

[he parietals motion was intro
duced, according to President Chuck
Cahn, to assure the IFC that the
motion would eventually reach the
floor of the faculty meeting. Cahn
has introduced a similar resolution
before the SAC, of which he is a
member, but if it is defeated, his
personal motion will not go to the
faculty. The IFC motion, even if
defeated by the SAC, will go to the
faculty,

The motion, introduced by Reeve
Kelsey, reads: “The Interfraternity
Council of Washington and Lee
University petitions the faculty to
allow the Interfraternity Council to
have control over the regulation of
women in the fraternity houses—
both in the making and enforcing of
policy. The existing judicial struc-
ture of the IFC Judicial Board and
the Student Affairs Committee shall
remain intact.”

The major constitutional change
elevated the junior justices from a
non-voting Status (voting only when
a senior justice is absent) to the
status of full associate justices of the
Judicial Board. This change only
recognizes what has been fact for
the last few years,

Several changes were made in
\rticle IL of the Constitution which
would have effectively prohibited
any non-national social fraternity at
W&L. Danny Leonard objected to
this stating that changing the Con-
stitution would limit the options
available to the fraternities, and that
many were questioning the benefits
of national fraternity affiliation, The
proposed change was voted down
with 16 votes against the change,
one abstention, one house ineligible
to vote. The remaining changes pass-
ed with 17 affirmative votes. These
changes must be voted on again in

News Analysis

By Roy Carlton

Last week in the presence of all
five faculty and administration mem-
bers of the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, the IFC passed a resolution
concerning parietals which has pro-
duced nothing but faculty criticism.
Indeed, this was to be expected from
the wording of the resolution which
all but demanded that fraternities
have the right to regulate their own
parietals free from University con-
trol,

Passage of the resolution was fol-
lowed by what was intended as a
dialogue between the IFC and the
SAC’s faculty wing. But this high
plateau of reason was never reached
despite the sincere efforts of both
groups. The reason is that there was
a basic disagreement over the func-
tions, direction and authority of the
IFC,

It was the contention of the IFC
representatives that they were au-
thoritative in themselves, indepen-

el

Max (David Christovich) criticizes one of his brothers for his coward-

 

dent of faculty authority. Their be-
lief was quickly shattered by the
faculty members present who ad-
vised them of the derivation of their
powers from the Trustees through
the faculty. Thus, in effect, every-
thing the IFC does is subject to re-
view by the faculty.

With this established, dialogue
over the resolution became point-
less. The IFC was obviously not in a
position to demand anything from
the faculty. Clearly, a restating of
the IFC stand on parietals was in
order.

Last night the IFC passed a sec-
ond parietals resolution. The content
was basically the same in that it
asked for control of parietal regula-
tions independent of the faculty, but
the tone of the resolution was a far
cry from that of last week. In effect,
it was a measure of the IFC’s in-
adequacy as an authoritative body
It is effective only as a sounding
board for fraternity grievances.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday, October 28, 1969

Abolish the IFC;
or make it an IFC

The 1968-69 academic year at Washington and Lee was
marked by a high degree of student and faculty activism. This
activism came in the form of implementing academic and
social changes that majorities of both the student body and
faculty desired. Student-faculty communication which facili-
tated processes of cooperation was an important asset in
effecting these changes. The student government through its
varied forms was able to participate and influence the faculty,
which maintains the power of issuing ultimate policy.

Not all the changes students and faculty had in mind were
forthcoming last year however.Two major items noticeably
absent from last year’s logbook are deferred rush and parie-
tals. Branches of student and faculty governments are now
turning their attention to these problems. The power of the
faculty in these areas is unquestionable; the power of that arm
of the student government involved, the IFC, is.

Cooperation with the faculty was a guideline, if not a
goal, last year of such branches of student government as the
Executive Committee and the Curriculum Committee. If the
students again desire to participate in the process of change,
they need a responsible and respected voice. Under existing
circumstances, the Interfraternity Council is not able to pro-
vide that voice.

The IFC is consciously seeking more authority over its
own, or what would seem its own, affairs. However, this power
must emanate from the faculty. Before the IFC can hope for
the faculty to delegate more authority, it must gain the re-
spect of the faculty.

The IFC is currently projecting an image of irresponsibil-
ity—a veritable International Fun Circus. But what does the
IFC have the power to do? Those who would believe that the
Interfraternity Council represents the eighteen houses on
this campus are victims of a cruel hoax. Constitutionally, the
only power delegated to the IFC is that of levying fines. But
even this process is subject to review by the SAC. In reality
the fraternities have no real lobby.

Therefore, the so-called irresponsibility of the IFC is
easily explainable from a structural frame of reference. The
purposes of the IFC are dual but mutually conflicting. Its
dominant purpose is to try to act as a lobbyist for the collec-
tive fraternities. The natural goal of the council is then the
protection of fraternity interests when those interests are
threatened by an outside agent, such as the Dean of Students,
the SAC, or the faculty in general.

The second function consists of the self-governing of the
fraternities. The Judicial Board is the major institution in-
volved in this area. The attitude of the Judicial Board is rather
to avoid finding violations unless direct action is imminent by
another body, such as the SAC. Similarly, the Judicial Board
tends to be lenient in prosecution. Decisions rendered are
based on the criterion of what is the minimum penalty the
SAC will inflict so that a house will escape with the littlest
amount of pain.

The predominant attitude of the Judicial Board then is
not the self-government of the system but the self-protection
of the fraternities. It is small wonder that the faculty remains
hesitant in yielding to the fraternities more than a token of
real power over their own lives.

Unfortunately, a malevolent paradox exists. The Inter-
fraternity Council must demonstrate more responsibility in
order to gain respectability—hence, power—in the eyes of
the faculty. But, by nature, the IFC is unwilling to act as the
faculty thinks it should—a responsible arm of student govern-
ment. But does it have the power to act responsibly? Can the
Judicial Board be expected to enforce rules sent down from
above, from a source it instinctively fears? Evidently, if the
[FC wishes to lift its feet off the ground, it will have to do
this. But what assurance does the IFC or the Judicial Board
have that acquiescence would work to their advantage so that
they would not in effect be feeding sheep to the wolves?

As we see it, there are only two alternatives. Either the
Interfraternity Council, which represents the largest number
of students on campus, dissolve itself and put an end to the
ruse its mere existence perpetrates, Or the faculty delegate
some authority to the IFC, thus making available a respon-
sible and authoritative institution of student government.
Then, perhaps, we can start tackling some of the real issues,
such as deferred rush, and quit playing games.

Toward self-regulation

By Reeve Kelsey

We would like to take issue with
several of the points made in last
Friday's editorial, “. . . And A
Wrong Way.” The editorial blithly
states that there is no relationship
between apartment and fraternity
housing, yet the editorial does not
say why the analogy is not valid,
The fraternity houses compete with
the apartments (and the upperclass
dorms) to attract the upperclassmen.
In comparing fraternity and apart-
ment living, only a handful today
would choose a fraternity house if
they had the choice.

Presently there is a notable ab-
sence of juniors and seniors living
in the fraternities and a rigorous en-
forcement of the regulation requir-
ing fraternity presidents to live in
the houses may result in some of the
more able fraternity leaders declin-
ing to seek the office of the presi-
dency.

The apartments offer two distinct
advantages—1) privacy and 2) no
restrictions of any sort. Under the
present system a sophomore living
in an apartment would have more
social freedom than a senior in the
fraternity house. Social restrictions
or codes of behavior should best be
left up to the individual fraternities
and the IFC. We cannot see how the
financial interest of the University
would be jeopardized by this change.
On the one side of the balance is the
potential for additional juniors and
seniors living in the fraternities and
less of a threat to the financial stabil-
ity of the fraternties if it is required
to make juniors and seniors live in

the house due to a small sophomore
class, on the other side of the bal-
ance what is there? How could
these reforms undermine the finan-
cial and membership stability of the
fraternities?

We would also wonder why the
vote last Monday was “an act of
arrogance and irresponsibility”? We
will grant that it was not the most
tactful maneuver the IFC ever exe-
cuted, but does arrogance and ir-
responsibility mean standing up and
saying that which has been in the
back of many an IFC member's
mind for several years?

One of the rather startling occur-
ences of that Monday night meeting
pointed to the breakdown of com-
munication between the IFC and

the Student Affairs Committee. The
SAC members seemed to be surpris-
ed at the IFC resolution because
they felt that they had just enacted
the reforms which the fraternities
desired. Yet the IFC had been led to
believe that only a carbon copy of
the dormitory regulations would be
able to pass. The SAC did not un-
derstand what the fraternities really
wanted, and the IFC did not realize
the willingness of the SAC to con-
sider that which they really wanted.
We would hope that IFC-SAC
bloodlettings will occur more fre-
quently in the future. Much of the
problems of the last few years could
have undoubtedly be lessened if one
group really knew what was on the
mind of the other.

The I ndependent Union petitions
faculty to grant freshmen cars

By Lex McMillan

| saw Friday that Dean John was
presented with a petition requesting
cars for freshmen. The Independent
Union sponsored the petition and
this I feel to be very significant in
that the present rule concerning cars
hurts the Independent students more
than anyone else on campus. The
students don't have the same ad-
vantage of a number of fraternity
brothers who will cither see to the
transportation of their dates or lend
them their cars.

Dean John has passed the petition
on to the Student Affairs Commit-

To the W&L Trustees:
too much for one man

By Reed Byrum

Alumni relations at Washington
and Lee have vastly increased both
in importance and scope during the
past several years. They have
erown far out of proportion to the
present facilities which are now
concerned with them.

Almost a third of our 14,000
alumni now participate in active fi-
nancial support of their alma mater,
representing an increase of 300%
since 1960, During this same period
the amount of capital contributions
has risen by almost 700%, Sach
vast increments accentuate the need
for an enlarged staff to handle the
vital necessities of such an integral
part of our university.

The 1964-66 Self-Study Report
cited a proposal for the appointment
of an associate director of alumni
relations, listing it as “urgency No.
2° (of immediate concern to the
University, with special funds and
approval required) and as being an-
ticipantly fulfilled by 1966-67, To
date, no action has been taken on
this idea, but this perhaps may be
for the betterment of relations. For,
in essence, this recommendation
iacked scope, as it failed to realize
the phenominal growth of our pro
eram. A separation of duties in the
lines of relations and finances is
sorely needed, and the appointment
of a co-director in charge of contri-
butions has become a necessity.

Mr. Washburn, who presenily
deals with all aspects of alumni re-
lations, has performed excellently in
his position, but the job is too great
for any one person to handle. A
man who can concern himself totally

with the promotion of the Univer-
sity with the purpose of receiving
contributions in mind is needed; he
must be a person who is able to
merge the talents of a business
manager and a public relations ex-
pert. Mr. Washburn could then con-
tinue to fulfill his chief duty — one
in which he has proven his irreplace-
able value-—of establishing a viable
relationship between the University,
the students, and the alumni, with a
somewhat lightened load.

tee. who will consider the matter
and give a report at the next faculty
meeting. Dean John did say that one
problem is student parking and that
it is very unlikely that freshmen will
have cars this year.

Though I heartily agree that park-
ing will be the major problem if
freshmen are allowed to have cars,
I feel it is a minor problem and
should not long stand in the way of
freshmen having cars. If the move
to give students a choice between
fraternities and Independent status
is to be at all successful this change
will have to be made.

As it stands now very few stu-
denis make the voluntary choice to
be non-fraternity men. The large
majority of students who have this
status had their decision made for
them by the system. It is imperative
that the administration move with
all possible haste to make a non-fra-
ternity status an attractive and a
competitive alternative to fraternity
life.

One problem which was discussed
in the Alumni Student luncheon
was that of apathy. It was pointed
out by one student at the meeting
that one of the major contributions
to this problem was the over-empha-
sis on fraternities. Students feel that
their most important objective in the
early part of their career as a col-
lege-man is to get into a fraternity.

W&L OAS

to be only one
on East Coast

By John Motsinger

Developments during the past few
days have made the success of the
Washington and Lee Model Or-
ganization of American States im-
perative. Plans for a National Model
OAS to be held in Washington fell
through as a result of Mr, Nixon’s
planned policy statement on Latin
America being scheduled the second
day of the conference. All speakers
refused to make any statements prior
to Mr. Nixon's speech, and the Pan-
American Union, a major sponsor
of the model, was skeptical about
holding a student model at the time
of the conference.

This makes W&L’s model doubly
important. First, George Washington
University planners for the National
MOAS are counting on the W&L
conference to maintain and further
interest this year in the organization
and, secondly, Washington and Lee
will have to be prepared to take the
windfall from National’s cancella-
tion.

Having been saddled with an in-
tercollegiate responsibility encom-
passing the whole Eastern seaboard,
student planners here have the
chance to execute a major confer-
ence on this campus. Here is a
chance to show our expertise in In-
ter-American relations, in diplomacy
and in administration.

What will be the windfall for
Washington and Lee from _ this
Model OAS? Primarily, there will
be a chance for students here to
participate in a simulation, A simu-
lation is akin to a war game in that
persons have to react to situations
demanding from them the knowledge
and skill of a diplomat. The Univer-
sity has held very successful Mock
Conventions which utilize the con-
cept of the simulation. The accur-
acy of our Mock Conventions re-
flects upon the educational value
of the simulation, as does the parti-
cipation of all of the student body
in the convention.

The Model OAS strives for this
accuracy in its own intercollegiate
simulation. The major difference is
that we invite other colleges to com-
pete with each other and to interact
with each other. We should be able
to learn from other students at other
schools by the mere fact of their
presence on this campus, apart
from their participation in our
model. Where’ we see isolation on
this campus—in the academic field
particularly—we also see a step be-
ing made to break down some of
this isolation.

Last year, members of the student
bodies of Madison, VMI, Prince-
ton, Old Dominion, American U.,
Mary Baldwin, Hollins and Ran-
dolph-Macon participated in the
Model OAS here. Since then, our
reputation in the field of intercollegi-
ate simulations has increased tre-
mendously as Washington and Lee
teams have shown their strength at
two national simulations and sev-
eral smaller simulations by being on
the only team to win more than one
national award last year.

Washington and Lee has the ad-
vantage this academic year of offer-
ing the only OAS model in the Eas-
tern United States. At a time when,
according to Mr, Nixon, our highest
priority is finding a solution to the
problems of our neighbors to the
south, a model of this sort on this
campus will be an important con-
tribution to our own understanding
of hemispheric relations and will
make that same contribution to the
more than fifteen colleges and uni-
versilies expected to participate here
next March.

You can feel Pinter's style under
your skin. It's the everyday world
turned a little cold, the way a chair
used to look vaguely alive and larg
erthan-normal in the dark when
you were a kid. Lenny says in the
play: “Il mean there are lots of things
which tick in the night. don't you
find that? All sorts of objects, which,
in the day, you wouldnt call any
thing else but commonplace. They
give you no trouble. But in the night
any given one of a number of them
is liable to start letting out a bit of a
tick. Whereas you look at these ob-
jects in the day and they're just

commonplace They're as quiet as
mice in the daytime.”

Pinter's world is like that. You
can hear his style. You'd say, “I've
got lo put this clock somewhere so
it wont make so much noise”
Lenny says, “Well, if its the clock
I'd better de something about it
Stifle it in some way, or something.”
In his speech Lenny's word “stifle”
ticks in the night, a faint signal of
menace, something in the air.

Time affects people differently in
Pinter's plays than in, say, Tbsen’s
The past in Ibsen is continuots,
moving into the present. In The
Hemecoming, though, Ruth talks
of her past as a series of still-lifes:
“We used to pass a a large
while water-lower We went
down a path on stones
There was a cold buffet.”

The present is fragmented in the
same way, Listen to Max talk about
his late life: “That woman was the
backbone to this family with a

will of iron, a heart of gold and a
mind,” And: “Mind you, she wasn't
such a bad woman. Even though it
made me sick just to look at her
rotten stinkine face

Each member of the family lives
separate from other members and
from parts of himself. Each lives in
a world like a dormant voleano, a
world of destructive energy which
still looks much like Ruth's picture
of America: “It's all rock, And sand.
It stretches so far every:
where you look, And there's lots of
insects there And there's lots
of insects there.” Her fire is con-
trolled. The men tend io explode

Pinter unites all these elements
and more by putting all the charact-
ers on stage. His people reveal them-
selves by their words, their rela-
tionships, their silences. if the audi-
ence listens. You should not miss
the experience, especially since reli-
able advance word says the Trouba
dour production is first-rate.

WEL player
for this week

 

JoJo Martin

JoJo Martin, a 180 pound offen-
sive halfback has been selected as
player of the week for his perform-
ance in the 10-6 W&L victory over
Bridgewater last Saturday. The most
consistent ground-gainer in the Gen-
eral rushing attack this season, JoJo
again led the infantry Saturday,
helping W&L to even their record
at 3-3 for the year. JoJo, a repeat
player of the week performer, is a
sophomore SAE from Midland,
Texas. This hard running and elu-
sive back has been a source of
pleasure and excitement to fans and
coaches alike.

W&L beats Bridgewater

By Mike Berry

Football, like any other game, is
a game of emotions, You can be a
three touch-down underdog one
weekend and a three touchdown
favorite the next. If a team has guts
it will play its best when it has to.
As a result, on many fall weeeknds
you find teams losing and winning
when they shouldn’t.

If you have been following W&L’s
Generals for the past two week-
ends you know what I mean. The
only thing, however, is that the
Generals couldn’t quite follow the
pattern of spoiling the predictions.
They nearly defeated Tufts Univer-
sity and were nearly overcome by
the Bridgewater Eagles.

The Generals were favored at
Riverside field in Bridgewater, Vir-
ginia; but, as was expected, the
Eagles gave the Generals a fight to
remember.

The Generals struck early in the
first quarter and managed to hang
on to win. The touchdown came
when Chuck Kuhn hit Bruce Green
on a 43 yard scoring toss. The Gen-
erals scored again in the second
quarter when Jack Baizley added
insurance points with a 35 yard field
goal,

Bridgewater came right back after
the field goal with a 65 yard scoring
drive. The drive was anchored
around the excellent running of
Marshall Flora. Flora posed a prob-
lem for the General defense all
afternoon as he carried the ball 36

times for 168 yards,

lhe General defense played when
it had too, however, and managed to
stop several Bridgewater drives, The
game was somewhat of a dissapoint-
ment for the Generals. It did, how-
ever, lift the General overall record
to 3-3 and the state small college
record to 2-1, which will be good
enough for second place in the state,
and, if Hampden-Sydney upsets
Randolph-Macon, they will be in a
three-way tie for first.

Ihe Generals have three games
left, all with conference foes, They
kick it off on the road this weekend
against Sewanee. The Generals are

favored even though it is Sewanee’s
homecoming game. However, the
Generals are ripe for an upset since
few Southern teams lose homecom-
ing games.

The Generals have managed to
establish a winning streak on the
road this year and should continue
to do so, They'll be a long way from
home this weekend so you won't get
to see them in action. They do prac-
tice from 4:30 to 6:00, Monday
through Friday so any time you
would like to drop over and see the
team, or Murph, or Mr, Corrigan
or the coaching staff, it’s free and it
is support.

 

Sports in General

Attitudes about W &L athletics

By John Robinson
Sports Editor

Since de-emphasizing its athletic
program, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity has fostered two differing
opinions. The first being that things
simply could not be worse. In con-
trast the second being that things
could not be better.

Ihe possessors of the former
opinion have definite gripes. The
Generals who were once the terror
of Virginia and boasted of national
rating in everything from football
to track are now forced to face un-
known opponents, This group claims
that de-emphasized sports mean a
complacent and boring brand of
competition. The result is a draw-
back rather than a contribution to
student life.

However, the opposing school of
thought quickly counters each of
these claims. To this group it seems
financially impossible for a small
university to import the necessary
jocks to bring the necessary national
recognition. Also W&L fields 13
varsity teams, more than some ath-
letic “powerhouses” which the SEC
or ACC can claim. These teams give
a significant percentage of the stu-
dent body the opportunity to partici-
pate in athletics at an intercollegi-
ate level. Granted that W&L has
scheduling problems. After all, who
wants to get beat by a team which
gives no athletic grants-in-aid? The
embarrassment is understandably
hard for opponents to accept. And
as for those who do believe the
competition is not as keen on an
unsubsidized team as on a fully fi-
nanced squad simply haven't
many of W&L’s games.

seen

Perhaps | am biased toward the
second group but I believe it is for
legitimate reasons. I've met all of
WA&L’'s coaches and no group at
Washington and Lee has impressed
me more. The attitude of this staff
is one of excitement and success.
Their enthusiasm for their particular
sport and sports in general is highly
contagious

Coach Corrigan, who now heads
the Athletic Department, openly ad-
mits that Washington and Lee can
beat any Opponent on any schedule

Lee's athletic program is that of the
athletes involved. This summer the
“Washington and Lee Magazine”
printed an interesting report on that
very subject. One particular section
of that article will re-inforce what |
have said. That section was a series
of interviews with many of the cap-
tains of W&L athletic teams, In
most of the interviews the athletes
stressed that they were proud that
they could hit, catch, throw, shoot,
run or endure with any opponents
they faced. The praise from each of
these captains fell on the idea of an
athletic program designed for per-
sonal development and satisfaction
rather than winning records.
Opinions are frequently arrived at
abruptly without adequate considera-
tion of the facts. That is why I im-
plore anyone to study the facts here
at W&L before degrading its unsub-
sidized athletic program. The pur-
pose of athletics here is defined thus-
ly: “To benefit all students, not just
a chosen few. .. . Victory is desired
and fought for. But the final success

Third cross-country loss

Bridgewater swept the first three
places and trounced W&L, 18-42 in
a cross-country meet on their home
course. The defeat dropped W&L
below .500 with a 2-3 record.

Bill Wilkinson paced the Generals
with his best finish, thirty-two sec-
onds out of first with 20:03, good
for fourth place on the 3.75-mile
course, Sixth overall and second for
the Generals was Bob Sherwood at
20:47. Dave Haydu was ninth at
21:13.

(Continued from Page 2)

Entirely too much emphasis is put
on this objective and as a result
when the freshmen get into their
houses they just lie down and quit.
Because of this a great deal of talent
and manpower is wasted. Students
waste enormous amounts of time in
pursuit of fitting into the fraternity
mold when they could be making
contributions elsewhere.

| feel that de-emphasis of the
importance of being a fraternity on
all fronts will aid W&L in becoming
a community of students in a learn-
ing environment, As it stands now
W&L is hardly more than a day
college visited for a few hours daily
by students who live in the local
area,

Phe cars for freshmen is a step in
the right direction and should be
made soon,

Baker-Bruyere spark
debaters at LaSalle

(Continued from Page 1)
Earlier this month, two W&L de-
baters—John Reynolds and Tim
Wright, both of Houston, Texas —
talked to approximately 6,000 high

school students in the Pittsburgh,
Pa. area.
Wright and Reynolds form a

highly-ranked team in W&L’s debate
program. The University was one
of five institutions of higher educa-
tion in the nation invited to send a
debate team to the Public Series
Debate program sponsored in Pitts-
burgh area high schools by the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

In addition to introducing high
school students to intercollegiate de-
bating by debating the National De-
bate Topic, the Wright-Reynolds
team constituted the first contact
many of the students had ever had
with Washington and Lee.

“It seems to have gotten a very
good response,” Reynolds comment-
ed. “The students were interested in
our traditions at W&L, including
coat-and-tie dress,”

“The visit was done unofficially
for the admissions program,” Pro-
fessor William W. Chaffin, debate
coach, commented. “Many of the
students had never heard of Wash-
ington and Lee before.”

parietals resolutions

(Continued from Page 1)

over the fraternities and that it
wishes fraternities to exercise a large
degree of  self-administration and
regulation, yet it has not ceded to
the IFC enough power to accom-
plish these ends, Since the 1969-70
year began the IFC has placed two
houses on social probation, In each
of these cases, the faculty-admini-
stration dominated SAC saw fit to
intervene and change the punish-
ment. Not even the IFC’s rush vio-
lation decisions are free from SAC
scrutiny.

Last week’s discussion of IFC
powers has not proved enough.
Though a clarification of those
powers was made, a change, in
either direction, is necessary. The
present IFC controversy is much
greater than parietals, they are only
the catalyst. The issue is the very
purpose of the IFC itself,
