Interim co-chairmen picked
to launch Mock Convention

In an unusually productive Exe-
cutive Committee meeting, two com-
mittees were organized and the in-
terim chairmen for the 1972 Mock
Convention were appointed. The
E.C, had one hundred percent at-
tendance.

Dan Silberberg, ZBI from Los
Angeles, and Tom Gillespie, KA
from Macon, were appointed co-
chairmen for one-year terms to the
Mock Convention Interim Commit-
tee. They were selected from four
applicants tonight following inter-
views,

The results of the Freshman Elec-
tions were announced and run-off
elections set to be from eight until

ETS announces

dates for GRE’s

The Educational Testing Service
has announced the six testing dates
during the current academic year
on which undergraduates and others
preparing to go to graduate school
may take the Graduate Record Ex-
aminations.

The first testing date for the exam
is October 25, 1969. Scores from
this administration will be reported
to the graduate schools before De-
cember 1.

The other five test dates are De-
cember 13, 1969; January 17, Feb-
ruary 28, April 25, and July 11,
1970, Equivalent late fee and regis-
tration deadlines apply to these
dates. Choice of test dates should be
determined by the requirements of
graduate schools or fellowship to
which one is applying. Scores are
usually reported to graduate schools
five weeks after a test date.

Included in the Graduate Record
Examinations are an aptitude test
of general scholastic ability and ad-
vanced tests measuring achievement
in 21 major fields of study.

Full details and registration forms
for the Graduate Record Examina-
tions are contained in the 1969-70
Bulletin of Information For Candi-
dates. The Bulletin also contains
forms and instructions for request-
ing transcript service on GRE scores
already on file with ETS. This book-

elections were held today. Phil
Thompson organized these elections.

Joe Tompkins discussed a propos-
ed film committee. Freshman Bill
Millkey filed a petition to give a
committee the responsibility for
choosing, showing, and publicizing
films. Millkey’s group hopes even-
tually to form a film society for the
discussion of films. The EC approv-
ed the petition on a trial basis for
the first two films. All students who
are interested in this kind of work
should contact Millkey in Room 202
of the Old Dorm.

Applications for freshman com-
mittee positions are being accepted
by Chuck Dobbins at the Beta

Freshman run-off is set

Six candidates remain in the runn-
ing for Freshman class offices after
yesterday's primary vote. In addi-
tion, a proposed constitutional
amendment was defeated.

Out of a field of ten candidates,
fom Mays a SPE from McLean,
Va., and Alan Prater, a Shreve-
port, La. Sigma Nu, remained in
contention for the Frosh Executive
Cominittee post. Prater was the
leader with some 93 votes while
Mays garnered 75.

Ihe Freshman Presidential race
saw Rick Gray from Dallas, Texas,
and Eddie Haslam of New Orleans
topping seven other candidates in
gathering themselves run-off berths.
Haslam’s 80 votes were high with
Gray just behind at 77.

Jeff Baugher, a Phi Kap from
Manhasset, L.1., and Jeff Burris, an
Indianapolis Sigma Chi finished first
and second respectively in the race
for the Freshman Vice-Presidency.
Baugher received 80 votes to Burris’s
75 while four other hopefuls were
further back.

In addition to the Frosh elections,
a constitutional amendment to
change the name of the Assimilation
Committee failed due to a lack of
votes. A majority of the Student
Body, or 716 votes, was required
for passage, but only 671 students
voted on the issue. There were 626

Last night, the IFC passed a reso-
lution which called for the sole
parietal jurisdiction of the IFC in
dealing with fraternity affairs. Sev-
enteen houses voted for the resolu-
tion; Kappa Sigma was unable to
vote because of lack of attendance
at previous meetings.

Faculty members of the Student
Affairs Committee—Messrs. Watt,
Imeson, Ray, and Hamer—attended
the meeting and offered comments
upon the resolution. Faculty com-
ments were generally unfavorable
because of several reasons, specific-
ally the financial interest of the Uni-
versity in the fraternities and the
control over fraternity affairs dele-
gated to the faculty by the Board
of Trustees, which in turn delegated
a large portion of this power to the
SAC.

The resolution reads as follows:
WHEREAS Washington and Lee
University is a small, liberal arts
men’s college, and its primary goal
is the education of young men to be
responsible citizens, and, as such,
the need for the University to act in
loco parentis does not seem rea-
sonable beyond the freshman year,
And social responsibility in any sit-

 

cake, IFC
to eat it, too

uation involving mature young men
cannot be dictated by the faculty or
any other organization,

And the men in fraternities at
Washington and Lee are mature,
aware, and competent enough to
gauge and enforce their own social
responsibility,

And the fraternity houses basically
compete with apartments as the resi-
dence of upperclassmen,

And a better balance of upperclass-
men living in fraternity houses
would be of unquestionable benefit
to both the fraternities and the Uni-
versity,

And the University does not see fit
to regulate in any way the social
conditions of any apartment

BE If RESOLVED by the Interfra-
ternity Council of Washington and
Lee University that the same condi-
tions should exist for the fraternity
houses as for unregulated student
housing, and the burden of social
regulation should rest solely upon
the individual fraternities, their
members, the girls’ schools, and the
girls themselves such regulation to
be completely within the jurisdic-
tion and under the auspices of the
Interfraternity Council.

Alumni to attend conference on

A special conference to inform
alumni representatives of the suc-
cesses and shortcomings, needs and
aspirations of Washington and Lee
University will be held at W&L this

The three-day conference, which
will open Thursday, Oct. 23, is ex-

Informal Bookstore reading hosts
Washington & Lee’s Poet Stuart

Tomorrow night at 7:30 Dabney
Stuart, will be in the Bookstore to
read from his second published col-
lection, A Particular Place, This col-
lection was published in May of
this year by Alfred Knopf. This
reading will be informal and cider
and donuts will be served at no
charge.

On the flyleaf of the new collec-
tion is a comment by Daniel Hoff-
man in which he says: “In A Parti-
cular Place Dabney Stuart's imagina-
tion records his descent into his own
beginnings, a seizing of those half-
hidden universal experiences from
which true self-knowledge must
come.”

Richard Calhoun in The Southern
Review said: “Dabney Stuart is al-

Looking Around...

ready one of our most accomplished
poets under thirty.”

Mr. Stuart was born in Richmond,
Virginia in 1937 and grew up there.
He attended Davidson College and
was graduated Phi Beta Kappa. He
attended Harvard as a Woodrow
Wilson Scholar, was awarded the
Howard Willet Prize for summers
work in poetry, the Dylan Thomas
Award of the Poetry Society of
America and a grant from the Na-
tional Foundation on the Arts and
Humanities. From 1961 until 1965
he was a teacher in the William and
Mary English department.

Now he makes his home with
his wife and young son here as an
assistant professor in the Washing.
ton and Lee English department.

total of about 100 guests will come

William C. Washburn, executive

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Tuesday, October 21, 1969

Openings and the Dance Board

The first bacchanalia of the year is now historical: the
cigarette butts have been swept from the tarnished floor of
WaL’s answer to Carnegie Hall; the fraternity houses have
all been mopped dry; the hang-overs and Alka-Seltzers have
both disappeared. About all that remains is the usual caustic
criticism of the Dance Board. In short, a typical Openings has
closed its chapter in the continuing story of General Lee’s
College.

The only part of this unchained melody we find disquiet-
ing is the large calibre rapid fire machine gun with over 1400
raucous barrels levelled at the Dance Board. We hardly need
to remind anyone that the Dance Board—rightly or wrongly
—is everybody's favorite whipping boy. But we do feel that
the responsibility to mediate in this perennial skirmish is in-
cumbent upon us. Of course, we do not expect to negotiate
any sort of lasting peace in the near future; we are simply
hoping for a momentary cease-fire.

One new complaint with the Dance Board echoing in
and around our portly columns these days does have consider-
able merit for a change. Doremus is not Carnegie Hall and
we do not wish to imply that the VMI Fieldhouse is. But,
VMI (acoustically-speaking of course) is a small step in the
right direction. Furthermore, we were assured by the Dance
Board that the concerts would be held there this year. The
Board’s excuse concerning the fact that Openings was held in
Doremus and not at VMI is reasonable—a scheduling con-
flict with VMI. However, this seems to be a symptom of poor
foresight in planning (which we concede is no easy task) .
We recommend that in the future the Dance Board prevent
such oversights and effectively close out one avenue of critic-
ism.

Other fusillades levied against the Dance Board are not
so easily dismissed, however. Many are simply the long-
standing by-products of hasty ill-considered judgement. Per-
haps the most vicious and unfair attacks against the Board—
simultaneously the most difficult to justify—are those con-
cerning the nature of the entertainment. The Dance Board
has about the same odds of successfully repelling one of these
attacks as Sisyphus did in rolling his rock up that hill in
Hades. The Board is trapped in that labyrinth of trying to
please all of the people all of the time. That just cannot be
done. However, reflecting on the three concerts thus far, we
consider the Dance Board to be making a genuine and sincere
effort in fighting this awesome battle.

Ian and Sylvia, Paul Butterfield, Martha Reeves—maybe
not all super-stars but we find it difficult to imagine wider
variety in entertainment.

This connects to a second source of disgruntlement with
the Dance Board, the quality of entertainment. The Board is
again occupying a definitely unenviable perch, for this second
dilemma approaches a degree of insolubility almost equal to
the first. Everyone demands big names in current entertain-
ment—the Board itself is no exception in this preference.
But what many of the barrels in the 1400-gun salute forget
is that powder is needed to drive a bullet; or, money—a lot
of it—is needed to bring top flight entertainment to W&L.
Too many expect nine concerts by the best nine groups in
the country. This would indeed be fine, if we had the re-
quired revenue. But two and two only equals four. Students
want the big names with the big price tags, but we only have
1400 students to share the bill.

Again, we feel the current Dance Board is exerting maxi-
mum effort in trying to solve this problem (granted this has
not always been the case in the past few years). But a certain
cooperation rather than sabotage from the critical student
body would greatly assist the Board. For example, last year
under considerable pressure the Dance Board initiated the
policy of selling individual student tickets. This practice was
designed for those students who either did not care to or
could not afford to purchase dance plan cards. The purpose
was to allow those students the chance to attend dance sets
by buying these tickets. Hopefully, the Dance Board would
profit as more people went to the concerts.

Accordingly, the Dance Board made the concomitant
statement that Dance plans were explicitly non-transferable.
It is a breach of the honor system to use another's card.
Worse, students who consistently engage in this malpractice
are not only jeopardizing their status in the University-——it is
punishable as an honor violation—but they are also under.
mining the same Dance Board about which they are complain-
ing. By depriving the Board of sorely-needed revenue, they
are restraining the Dance Board’s freedom of action in sche
duling future entertainment.

We had hoped that the Board would more stringently en
force their regulation procedures at the door during Open
ings. However, the Board was again lax in this area as they
had been at Homecomings. But how can they do better? It
would be a disappointing commentary on our “honor system”
if they were forced to deny students the rights of exit and re-
entry. But they may have no alternative.

To those students who delight in listening to their own
prattle about the sad state of entertainment we can only point
out that they have at least one opportunity to do something

constructive about if,

W&L alumnus, will speak in Lee Chapel tonight.

IFC

By Reeve Kelsey
IFC Senior Justice

he relaxation of parietal regula
tions that went into effect last week-
end were long in coming and point
up the faults in both the IFC and
the faculty. The initial legislation
was introduced into the IFC last
October 21. That it took almost one
year to implement the legislation
shows the entire inflexibility of the
present system.

The IFC is essentially powerless
in these areas as effectively explain-
ed in last Friday's Ring-ium Phi by
Jay Wetsel. It is powerless to change
much of the regulations surrounding
fraternities and most of its remain-
ing powers are subject to either
review or veto by the faculty or the
Student Affairs Committee. | would
hope that in the near future, con
trol over essentially student affairs
could be turned over to students or,
at least. a body which has student
representation equal to that of the
faculty.

One of the most important areas
of needed reforms continue to be
that of parietals. It is essentially a
question of equity. Why is there a
double standard applied to fraternity
and apartment housing? Why must
one group be discriminated against?
Why not let the girls’ schools set the
minimum standards? The faculty
policy of imposing socially restric-
tive regulations on the fraternity
houses and the upperclass dormi
tories clearly accentuates the ten
dency for the student body to frag
ment all over the town of Lexington

The answer lies in allowing the
collective fraternities in the IFC to
determine the social regulations un
der which it seeks to opearte. Much
criticism in recent years has been
levied at the IFC Judicial Board for
failure to aggressively enforce many
of the existing regulations. Bul what
could one expect from a body which
basically disagrees with many of the
provisions which it is charged with
enforcing? If the IFC were able to
set the policy that it had to enforce,
the effectiveness of the IFC as one
of the major imstitutions of student
government could reach its full po
tential,

One also doubts the rule-making
ability of an assembly of over 100
professors. Would a sientist claim
any competence over matiers regard
ing the curriculum of the Fne Arts
Department? Yet all members of the
faculty are thrown into the role of
experts in the matter on the prob
lems of undergraduate life. A com

Holton speaks today;
Governor W &L grad?

By Greg Thompson
fonight, Linwood Holton, the Re-
publican nominee for governor of
Virginia, will be speaking at Lee
Chapel . The event is being spon-
scored by the Young Republicans.

Holton, a native of Virginia, grad-
uated from W&L with a Bachelor of
Arts degree after serving in the
Navy as a captain during World
War II, In 1949, he received a LLB
from Harvard Law School.

As the Republican candidate for
governor in 1965, Mr. Holton poll-
ed the largest number of votes ever
cast for a Republican State Candi-
date in Virginia. It was the first
time in modern Virginia political
history that the Democratic candi-
date was elected by less than a ma-
jority.

As far as his political ideas are
concerned, Holton emphasizes the
improvement of the quality of state
education as well as the establish-
ment of an office of student affairs
that would keep him, as governor,
informed of the ideas and problems
of students. Also, he favors a re-
organization of the state administra-
tive system so that governmental
operations might become more effi-
cient and less expensive.

Last Wednesday at WGL

By Kevin O'Grady

Lee Chapel—hardly Faneuil Hall.
Six men spoke. The United States,
ind its government, still holds forth.
But for how long?

In the October 10 issue of Time,
the results of a poll of the class of
1973 were issued: “One out of every
three freshmen said that he believes
the U.S. needs some sort of revolu-
tion, and one out of five described
himself as either a radical or a revo-
lutionary four out of five that
politics is dominated by string pull-

ing special interest groups.” If, as
Time itself suggests, “. . . each new
class of college freshmen is more
radical,” the future of America does
not loom large.

Perhaps a revolution will come.
More likely not. But a large segment
of the American youth are truly dis-
satisfied with their government. The
politicians and the leaders of to-
morrow are bred in the colleges and
universities of today. If respect for
the Government and its policies is
not being fostered in today’s youth,

almost total lack of violence during
the Oct. 1§ Moratorium on the Viet-

things, that responsible groups have
assumed leadership of the anti-war
movement. If SDS had been involv-

But if she did, that would be grounds

The Ring-tum

Mr. Holton, in this year’s cam-
paign, is judged to have an even
chance against his Democratic foe,
William C. Battle. Holton’s strength
as a candidate reflects the growing
power of the Virginia Republican
Party. If elected, he would be the
first Virginia Republican governor
of the century, and only the second
in the history of Virginia,

In 1865, Gilbert Walker became
the first Republican governor of
Virginia, an office which he was to
hold for four years. After Walker,
the Virginia Republican Party start-
ed to decline. With the defeat of
Mahone, a Republican candidate for
governor in 1889, the state Republi-
cans were severly weakened. The
plight of the Republican Party was
due to two basic setbacks: the con-
servative Virginia populace associat-
ed the Republican Party with Re-
construction policies, and the con-
stitution of 1902, which restricted
the electorate.

From 1925 to 1965, minor but
ever-present power of the state Re-
publicans kept Senator Harry Byrd,
a Democrat, in office. By Byrd's
death in 1966, the Republican Party
had to come to state power through
the leadership of Ted Dalton. This
is demonstrated by the victories of
the Republicans in the national elec-
tions of the 1960's,

Now that Byrd Decromats are
voting Republican, and that the De-
mocratic Party is being identified
with some of its unpopular national
policies, the Republicans are flying
high. Thus, Mr. Holton hopes that
such a political atmosphere will pro-
duce victory for him and his party
when election time arrives.

m retrospect

where are tomorrow’s leaders going
to come from? The United States
will probably remain a viable poli-
tical institution. But it may find it-
self as a second-rate country, led by
a medicore, short-sighted, sub-elite.
Change must come. The Vietnam
War must be ended as quickly as
possible. Domestic reforms must be
institutetd. Then, and only then,
can America insure itself of the
leadership and support that it usu-
ally lacks.

Above the future of the United
States lies the future of the earth.
The disease of war does not just
affect us, as the Arab-Israeli War
and the Sino-Soviet border clashes
indicate. Murder and death, in the
guise of “justifiable” war, have be-
come an everyday occurence. But
why? Albert Schweitzer in Civiliza-
tion and Ethics, remarks: “Rever-
ence for life affords me my funda-
mental principle of mortality, name-
ly. that good consists in maintain-
ing. assisting, and enhancing life,
and that to destroy, to harm, or to
hinder life is evil.” Are we, then,
immoral? Col. Brooke answers that
question rather well when he sug-
gests that since Italy lost 600,000
men in World War Hf and still sur-
vived as an autonomous nation, pro-
portionately in Vietnam we can af-
ford to lose 4,200,000 men. No, we
are not immoral, Rather, we are
amoral. We have lost the ability to
judge what is right and what is
wrong. We have lost the sense of the
value of a human life. Lord Byron,
in his poem “Darkness,” written in
1816, may well have foretold our
fate:

The waves were dead; the tides
were in their grave,

The moon, their mistress, had
expired before;

The winds were withered in the
silugnant arr,

And the clouds perished
Darkness had no need

Of aid of them-—She was the
Universe

Washington and Lee
beaten by Tufts’ Jumbos

By Mike Berry

The Jumbos of Tufts University
invaded Wilson Field on Saturday
afternoon and found out that they
would have a tough time convincing
the Generals, and themselves, that
they are supposed to be Number One
in the East.

After a start, the Generals
managed to make a strong offensive

late

drive. The drive was halted at the
Jumbo’s one yard line and they took
over. The Generals defense then

came into their own as they dropped
Jumbo running back John Dember
for a safety, The Generals were un-
able to make a consistent drive in
the first-half and went into the in-
termission trailing 12-2,

The Generals, for the second-
week in a row, proved that they are

a second half team. Chuck Kuhn
came out in the third period and hit
his favorite of late, Bruce Green,
for a twenty yard touchdown pass.
fhe Jumbos had matched the play
earlier in the quarter, however, and
the score then stood 20-8. In the
fourth quarter, Jack Baizley came
in to hit end Steve Mahaffey for a
nine yard scoring play.

As the game ended, the Generals
were on the Jumbo 35 yard line and
driving for the winning touchdown
that never came. The Generals lost
a heartbreaking 20-15.

The Generals were not able to
strike early enough in the ball game.
The strong finish they showed was
not enough to overcome the quick

THE RING-TUM PHI

Tuesday’s Players of the Week

Bruce Green-offense

Bruce Green, a junior flanker
from Fort Myers Beach, Florida,
earns Offensive pla yer of the week
honors for his outstanding effort
against Tufts. Bruce, a member of
KA Order and a returning letter-
man, caught seven passes for 130
yards, nearly half of W&L’s aerial
yardage, and scored one T-D.

 

Mike O’Donnell-defense

Winner of the defensive player of
the week title is Mike O'Donnell, a
hard-nosed end from Washington,
D.C, Mike, a sophomore Phi Psi,
has shown consistent improvement
throughout the year and really
sparked against Tufts. He contained
the Jumbo’s game and made four
solo tackles,

Why Bob runs C-C

By Tom Rowe

Ever since the Broadway show
came out some years back, people
have been asking the question “What
makes Sammy run?”, With the
American’s delight in slogans, they
like to extend it, for instance, to ath-
letes. What makes Jimmy Brown
run? O. J. Simpson, Maury Wills,
Jim Ryun, Jim Hines, et al.? At
W&L, you and I know that Joe
Namath can’t run (bad knees?),
before we brush off the question as
irrelevant, let’s use it one more
time. Like,
wood run?

Bob Sherwood is the greatest thing
to hit W&L country since,
why, since Harry Zeliff. It is ironic
that one of W&L’s ablest runners
should graduate the very year before
a worthy counterpart comes along.
Sherwood and Zeliff could have as-
sured W&L of many a cross country
win together. As it is, Sherwood is
holding up the 1969 contingent very
well by himself. What makes you
run, Bob?

“I guess you'd call it motivation
| get personal satisfaction from
running, and it keeps me in good
shape.”

The words come slowly, for Bob
Sherwood is a modest person, an
unusual trait for an athlete of this
generation. He isn't exactly sure
why he likes to run (“Nobody ever
asked me before.”), but he leaves the
impression that an outside influence
shaped his career,

“I had a coach in high school who
greatly influenced me. He talked
dedication, sticking with a sport,
oding the job right. His spirit had a
great effect on his teams. He has
always inspired winning teams as a
coach. He was at my high school
(Northern Highlands in Avondale,
New Jersey) only my last two years,
but he took us to the state finals
where we finished second.” Their
best runner, Bob says, was accepted
ut Kansas University, which has
been Jim Ryun country for the past
several years,

defeats

defending Va. champs

Friday W&L managed to score
only one goal, but it was one goal
too many for Roanoke College, the
defending Virginia soccer champ for
four years. It was one of Washing-
ton and Lee’s biggest wins in years
as they held the Roanoke power-
house scoreless.

Roanoke was flying high coming
into the game at Alumni Field. The
visitors had downed the Generals in
their last three meetings and _ this
season were 6-0. On defense not a
single shot had been scored against
Roanoke College this fall. On of-
fense a twice-time All-American left
wing, Scott Anderson, was a terror
in past matches,

But Washington and Lee realized
that a play-off berth for the Virginia
title depended on a win. The game
plan was based on field balance with
a One-on-one assignment against
Anderson given to Branden Herbert.
It was evident that whoever scored
first would be the winner.

Outstanding for W&L was goalie,
Ken Newman, who was credited

with ten saves. Both Brian Price and
Mark Sayers turned in outstanding
performances at fullback. At half-
back Carl Hyatt and Seamus Mc-
Keon did excellent jobs at both ends
of the field. Freshman Branden Her-
bert playing one-on-one defense
held Scott Anderson to one wide
shot. Meade Kampfmuellar who usu-
ally plays hot and cold did well also.
Sophomore Don Belt hustled hard
helping on defense as well as offense.

The only score of the match oc-
curred with 4:57 expired in the
fourth period. The ball took a short
bounce and Seamus McKeon smash-
ed it in from the right side, from
a distance of 35 yards.

With its three toughest games in
a row under its belt, W&L emerg-
ed 1-1-1, losing only to Virginia
last week. That makes the Generals
2-1-1 in conference competition and
4-1-1 overall. With a brief rest over
Openings Weekend, Washington and
Lee must get ready again for those
next door neighbors, V.M.I. The
Keydets invade Alumni Field at
3:15 Wednesday.

 

Thunder’s Theories

Money and professional sports

By Thunder Thornton

It's hard to believe that the World
Series ended just last week and al-
ready professional basketballs are
bouncing on arena floors throughout
the land, What is more, pro football
players have already labored through
games numbering in the double fig-
ures, counting exhibitions, and re-
gular schedules have barely been
dented,

The point is that professional
promoters have scheduled their un-
derlings for a few extra games of
the almighty dollar. Thank good-
ness sport fans were spared the
agony (or boredom) of extended
playoffs in the two major baseball
leagues, As it was, the Orioles
could not fill their stadium for the
opening game of this year’s annual
October classic, which may become
a November classic if present trends
continue,

There had to be an excuse for
these playoffs, so the owners devised
the division system in the once sane
National and American Leagues.
Ihe true baseball fan should be irate
that he was cheated of seeing the
Amazin’s climb over San Fran-
cisco, Los Angeles, and Cincinnati,
us well as the Cubs and the Braves.
And what if they had remained lov-
able, laughable, and last—under the
new system they could only be sixth,

a position that smells of first divi-
sion,

But pro football surely must be
regarded as the haven for many
owners, Once the NFL-AFL merger
becomes practiceable next year, the
fans will have the chance to witness
the Browns and Colts rubbing el-
bows with the like of the Dolphins,
Patriots, etc., etc. I guess the next
step is to incorporate the Roanoke
Buckskins into the big leagues.

How long can any one of our
professional sports claim to be the
American national game when the
fans can't keep pace with the manu-
everings of the management. Who
knows when the Oakland baseball
franchise might show up in Las
Vegas, or we might wake up to find
that the NBA and ABA have merged
under a five division, thirty-seven
team format. Pro athletes are be-
coming more and more skillful and
exciting, but their talents are being

Bob has had four years of experi-
ence in high school, Bob is much
stronger and a better runner.”

But Miller added that Zeliff’s as
sets, which made Harry a good run-
ner and W&L’s mealticket the past
few years, were an exceptional will
to win, hard work, and determina-
tion, Bob is a more natural runner.

In stressing that Sherwood has
his prime ahead of him, Miller con-
sidered hills to be the main area for

prostituted by greedy club owners.

It is unrealistic to think that the
powers will ever let go of a good
financial thing; in fact, more teams,
divisions, and playoffs are probably
in the offing. There must be, how-
ever, some point at which public
opinion will find all this ludicrous.
In the meantime, that paragon of
sanity and stability, college foot-
ball, should have gotten a foothold
on the populace. The college sche-
dule is a feasible nine of ten games,
there are plenty of rivalries, and the
collegiate game is catching the pro
version in excitement,

improvement. Sherwood, coming
from the flat country of New Jer-
sey, isn’t used to running up hills.
He needs to condition himself so
that he won’t be worn out by W&L’s
terrain. Another problem is that he
ran no more than two-mile courses
in high school. The course at Roa-
noke last week, for instance, covered
over four miles.

All signs point to Bob making the
adjustments to insure a long, suc-
cessful career. His stocky frame (6
feet, 160 pounds) carries him well
over the course. Bob is the kind of
guy who always gives one hundred
percent and runs his best from
personal pride. However, nothing
succeeds like success, and the will
to win that made Zeliff and the vic-
tory pattern that is emerging as
part of Sherwood’s style may soon
become the dominant make-up of
what makes Bob Sherwood run,

The Generals did manage to con-

were stopped four times inside the

This week’s game pits W&L
against Bridgewater College. Bridge-
water has been having a rough sea-
son, losing the majority of its games,
They do not pose a strong threat,
but they are being played in their
own backyard and they will not be
a pushover by any means.
