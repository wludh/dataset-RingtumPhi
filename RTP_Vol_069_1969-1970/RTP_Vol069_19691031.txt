These and numerous other pro-

Research Program, a Washington
and Lee grants-in-aid program for
its students which is considered
“quite unique,” according to the
dean of the College.

This year 38 W&L students are
participating in 33 Robert E. Lee re-
search projects under the direction
of faculty members. This marks the
10th year of the program. During
the past nine years and eight sum-
mers, 539 students have been en-
gaged in 430 projects, according to
Dr. William W. Pusey III, dean of
the College.

The projects are diverse. They
range from a psychological study of
the conceptual factors in human
short-term memory to work on pre-
serving historical records of Rock-
bridge County

One of the unique factors is that
the projects are frequently on the

graduate-school level, yet are being
undertaken by undergraduates who
work closely with their professors.

“A non-credit program of this size
is quite unique in college educa-
tion,” Dean Pusey said.

Originally made possible by a gift
in 1960 of over $250,000 by the
late Gustavus Benz Capito, an 1899
graduate of Washington and Lee, it
has been possible to maintain and in-
crease the scope of the research
program through the “generous do-
nations of the Charleston and other
foundations,” Dean Pusey noted.

Participating students receive
grants-in-aid ranging from less than
$100 to nearly $1,000 for several
students working together on a sin-
gle project. Students report on their
work during a series of small, in-
formal dinners held during the
school year for them and their pro-
fessors.

by the Troubadours. An identical
format for dinner will be followed
at the same time and place Saturday.

A student debate on the question
of co-education at Washington and
Lee will begin at 8 p.m. Friday, fol-
lowed by a panel discussion on co-
education,

Other Friday activities include a
coffee for parents of law students,
an open house at McCormick Li-
brary, and visits to a weekly chemis-
try seminar, the University observa-
tory, and Home Edition, a student

Huntley at the President's House,
and a meeting of regional agents for
the Parents Fund.

A Report to Parents program will
be held Saturday in Lee Chapel,
with Richard T. Scruggs, president
of the Parents Advisory Council,
presiding. Speakers will include
President Huntley; Swede Henberg,
student government president; and
Farris P, Hotchkiss, director of de-

On Sunday, one of the nation’s
leading evangelists will speak at a
University non-denominational wor-
ship service, a new feature of the
annual Parents Weekend.

Dr. Myron §S. Augsburger, presi-
dent of Eastern Mennonite College
and Seminary at Harrisonburg, Va.,
will speak at the informal “coffee
house” service to be held in the ta-
vern of the University Center.

Dr. Augsburger was cited in the

Sept. 19 issue of Time Magazine as
one of the most influential leaders
among evangelicals in the movement
away from spiritual isolation and
toward involvement in social prob-
lems.

A native of Ohio, Dr. Augsburger
has conducted evangelistic crusades
in Various cities throughout the Unit-
ed States and has held ministries in
Europe, the Middle East, India and
Japan,

He holds his A.B. andTh.B. de-
grees from Eastern Mennonite, his
B.D. degree from Goshen College in
Goshen, Ind., and his Th.M. and
Th.D. degrees from Union Theolo-
gical Seminary in Richmond.

Deferred Rushing Considered

tempt to discern the sentiment of
fraternity members in regard to rush,

Last year a proposal eliminating
pledging activity during first semes-
ter was voted down by the faculty.
A definite decision concerning de-
ferred rush for next year will be
made by the SAC for the December
faculty meting.

The 14 IFC members that were
present made it clear that they, for
the most part, were against defer-
ring rush entirely.

Swede Henberg, president of the
student body, pointed out that im-

provements could be made in the
present deferred rush system if a
new system was not possible. He
added that in the chaos of rush week
many people do not receive bids and
suggested that houses be required to
see people who sign up for “dinner
dates” on deferred rush.

Dr. G. W. Ray, associate pro-
fessor of English, said rush week
has the tendancies of “herd instinct”
and suggested that there be a “cool-
ing-off period.” He also asked about
problems in the present rush system.

Faculty Will Entertain
IFC Parietals Petition

The faculty will consider an Inter-
fraternity Council petition on parie-
tals restrictions in fraternity houses
at its regular meeting Monday after-
noon, accoridng to Dean of Students
Lewis G. John,

The petition which was passed as
a resolution by the IFC at its meet-
ing last Monday, asks that the IFC
“have control over the regulation of
women in the fraternity houses—
both in the making and enforcing of
policy.”

The proposal comes to the faculty
after being considered by the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee earlier this
week, Dean John said.

A plan by the IFC for a delayed
rush to go into effect next year will
not be discussed at this meeting, he
added. He speculated that this matter

Dean John also said the faculty

In Search of A Solution

The Executive Committee Monday night approached a
problem that becomes increasingly crucial to W&L each year.
Frankly stated, the University is not getting the recognition,
and hence the applications and the quality of students, that
its advantages would seem to attract for it.

The existence of W&L is predicated on the belief that a
small liberal arts college offers an alternative to the muli-
university type education, and that many students with the
highest credentials will prefer that alternative if only they
know about it. The potential has not always been realized,
of course, but the alternative is nonetheless alive here.

The failure has been to present it as such to those students
who might be interested in W&L, and whom the University
is certainly interested.

W&L traditionally has drawn on sources for students—
primarily the Southern Establishment—which are no longer
sending their sons exclusively to high status colleges close
to home. Thus the competition with large state universities,
as well as with private Northern schools, has become increas-
ingly more acute even for those students who might seriously
consider W&L anyway.

However, if W&L is to maintain itself as a respected in-
stitution of higher learning, it must also attract the children
of the middle and lower classes from all over the country.
This necessity is partly due to the drain from traditional
sources. More important is the educational need which is
served by including students from widely varying back-
grounds in a community which is conducive to the inter-
change of ideas.

It is precisely these students who, having no tradition
which directs their attention to W&L, might overlook it com-
pletely when they choose a college, even though its approach
might be best suited to them.

In some cases, of course, W&L can’t offer the funds
necessary to attract students whose parents are in the lower
income brackets. Frequently, however, money is available
from outside agencies, such as the Office of Economic Op-
portunity, and the presence of these students would entail
no financial burden at all for the University.

Both students and alumni, according to the dialogue in
the EC meeting, are concerned about the problem and are
willing to help. Further, the Admissions office has already
increased its recruiting efforts. This is merely the beginning
for all these groups, but it is necessary and should be strength-
ened.

We feel that the University has still another resource in
the attempt to broaden the base of knowledge about this
school, especially regarding the role it shares with so few
other colleges in American education. That resource is the
Office of Public Relations. It is true that present facilities and
staff size preclude its immediate utilization, but it is also the
case that well-done releases and publications, written in co-
operation with the Admissions Office and directed to coun-
selors as well as students, can provide a greater scope in re-
cruiting efforts and speak more efficiently to a larger audience
that personal contacts alone can. Of course, personal contacts
are also essential and should also be expanded, but an ex-
panded information program is its logical complement.

It has never been the duty of the Public Relations office
to do anything other than send news releases to Virginia
newspapers about University announcements, and occasional-
ly to hometown papers when a particular student has done
something noteworthy. This duty is a basic one, but the office,
with the proper adaptation of materials and expansion of
staff, can be utilized as a basic part of recruiting and gen-
eral public relations effort that is long overdue.

Letters to the Fditor...

Henberg Responds

lo the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:

I write to clarify what I feel is an
egregious misrepresentation of last
Monday's Executive Committee
meeting. From the gist of the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi article of Oct. 28,
it seems one is to infer that defini-
tive plans have already been drawn
up concerning a major university
fund drive. This is not the case; it is
a simple misinterpretation of what
was said at the meeting last Monday.

As it now stands, a fund drive is
a good possibility, not an established
fact. My action in appointing
Messrs Tomkins, Ogilvie and Azuma
to examine the matter expresses a
belief that they might be instrumen-
tal in helping formulate plans for
such a drive. My intention was cer-
tainly not to ‘announce’ anything,
and I feel sure I was tentative
enough in my approach to the matter
that no one should have assumed I
was making a formal announcement,
Such an announcement would come
only after a definite plan had been
made, from the President of the
University. And I made it clear that

no such announcement was antici-
pated in the near future.

All of the above, however, is mere
prelude to my real cause for feeling
incensed. The first page headline in-
timating that I had announced a plan
for a building fund drive is absurd
enough. Obviously | must think of
‘plan’ in a different sense than who-
ever wrote the headline, for I cer-
tainly have no idea what plan I pro-
posed. To me at least, a plan must
have some substance, and there is
little substance to a suggestion that
a drive may take place sometime
during the next 18 months. Even
more ridiculous—and to my mind
irresponsible—was the headline on
the back page saying I had let ‘the
cat out of the bag.’

The implications of that headline
are obvious, Someone must have
thought I was revealing some secret
that had been insidiously kept from
the students for some time. No one
is trying to be furtive: a fund drive
is a good possibility and the EC rec-
ognizes that student involvement is
desirable. It is as simple as that. |
am all in favor of ingenious head-
lines, but I certainly hope the Tues-

Dylan Dead? Fearless Reporter
Relates Secret of Star’s Demise

By Bob Webb

Guest Columnist
Wild rumors have recently been
circulating throughout this fair

campus as to the probability of the
death of Bob Dylan, the God of folk
rock music. Taking upon myself the
task of resolving this controversy, |
have labored many tedious hours in
research and have come to the un-
contestible conclusion that Dylan is
in fact dead!

As the rumors rightiy point out,
his motorcycle accident several years
back proved fatal but news of his
death was suppressed due to the
skillful machinations of his pro-
moters. Through various under-
ground sources, | have found thai
the voice singing in Nashville Sky-
line (notice how different it is in
tone from previous albums) is actu-
ally that of his longlost brother,
Percy Zimmerman, who immigrated
from an Egyptian pottery factory in
1965.

Close examination of the album
cover reveals that Dylan is really
dead. Notice the growth of beard
and fingernails, both of which con-
tinue to grow after the body has
ceased its normal functions. Notice
his glazed eyes. Why is this man
smiling? Because he is propped up
on his guitar which is dangling from
the tree branches in the upper right
hand corner by an almost invisible
wire,

If this obviously conclusive evid-
ence isn't sufficient to convince the
most ifrational skeptic, then the
abundant symbolism incorporated

into the album should suffice. No
lice how Dylan has his right hand
poised over his head. It’s the ancient
Babylonian symbol for death. No-
tice his dingy, brown clothes. They
are the same ones worn by candi-
dates for cremation in Afganistan
around the 13th century. And notice
that his guitar has three white and
two yellow jewels, These five jewels
plus the one hat he is wearing equals
six——the number of pallbearers that
lowered his body into the grave.

But the clinching bit of evidence
comes when the album itself is
heard, But first it must be broken
into four equal parts, mixed, and
glued back together aagin. Then
when it is played at an angle of ex-
actly 36, backwards at 18 RPM,
and under a black light. Johnny
Cash is clearly singing, “I buried
Bob, Is he dead? Is he dead?” Ob-
viously he is.

Gaping Around...

Wilson Planning For
New Marching Band

By CHIP HARRIS

Wilson Memorial Statium may
once again resound to the music of
a Washington and Lee marching
band, if enough student interest is
expressed, At present a pep band is
in the process of forming around the
nucleus of the ROTC band, and
musically inclined students are ur-
gently needed to round out the or-
ganization.

In 1956, when Washington and
Lee football was still strong, and
in an attempt to overcome the psy-
chological effects of de-subsidation
a marching band combined with the
glee club to offer half-time enter-
tainment and a medley of Washing-
ton and Lee cheers.

The combinations continued to
sometime in the early 1960’s, when
a lack of interest brought its down-
fall. During its better years, how-

day edition does not, again, let its

own cleverness carry it away from

accurate representation of the facts.
Swede Henberg

On W&L Traditions
lo the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:

| always thought that Washington
and Lee men had the courage to be
different.

The courage of self-enforcement
of an honor system, the courtesy of
saying “hello” on campus, the dignity
of dressing in a business-like manner
were all different from many schools
even when | attended Washington
and Lee University before World
War IL.

Those who did not like these in-
stitutions did not attend Washington
and Lee. Sometimes we were chided
by our peers for involving our-
selves in a system such as this.

Nevertheless, we did not bow to
the pressures of conformity evidenc-
ed by either protest or disinterest,

I sinceerly hope that Washington
and Lee men will have the courage
to continue to be different, will re-
establish the values that can be
found in these customs, and will be-
gin to try to sell their fellow students
on the value of these customs.

Class Officers As EC

lo the Friday Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

| would like to clarify the stand
of the freshman class officers in re-
gard to my proposal to the Executive
Committee last Monday night. What
I proposed was that class officers be
expected to attend EC meetings by
a pledge to office as its regular mem-
bers are. | do not in any way feel
that they should be given the right
to vote nor or at any other time in
the future. | feel this proposal would
attain three objectives.

First, it would result in better rep-
resentation because a greater diver-
sity of opinion would result from a
non-voting representing body,

Second, it would serve as a check
on present EC members.

Third, by getting all class officers
together with the EC, expansion of
powers and duties of the class of-
ficers could be intelligently discussed
und hopefully decided upon so the
offices would cease to be an absur-
dity. Jefl Burris

ever, the band and glee club cut at
least one record composed of then
campus favorites including ‘“Wash-
ington and Lee Swing”, “Fight,
Fight, Blue and White”, “Rah Rah,
Generals”, and “Friendships”.

To provide entertainment at half-
times, the athletic department began
hiring area high school bands, an
activity still carried on and one
which often costs the school as much
as several hundred dollars per team.
One rather apparent drawback to
this form of entertainment is that
often the imported bands fail to in-
clude W&L songs, notably “Wash-
ington and Lee Swing” in their re-
pertoire.

Upon Major William Jones’ ar-
rival to W&L two years ago he dis-
covered several copies of the band
and glee club’s record cut some-
time in the 1950's. As his duties in-
cluded the direction of the ROTC
band Major Jones was curious as to
why the school lacked as little as a
pep band,

Consequently the ROTC band be-
gan appearing at home football
games and some home basketball
games, notably the rather infamous
Roanoke College basketball game
last year. Conferring with the Ath-
letic department last year Major
Jones discovered additional inter-
est in a pep band, and this year, un-
der the direction of Gene Corrigan,
something concrete was done.

Funds have been made available
for the purchase of uniforms for
such an organization, and authori-
zation for a varsity letter to be is-
sued to members of the band has
been approved. In addition, athletic
passes have made available for
members, and the ROTC depart-
ment will allow the band to use
$3,000 worth of new musical instru-
ments recently requisitioned from
the army.

With little publicity the band has
already attracted some 20 students,
but more are needed before the Ath-
letic Dpartment will purchase uni-
forms and considrably more are
needed before the idea of a march-
ing band will be feasible.

Larry Sutton is directing the band
this year. Under his guidance, it is
holding regular practice sessions and
is attending home football games.

Since at least Major Jone’s ar-
rival, the school has regularly been
receiving invitations to participate
in the Marti Gras, the Apple Blos-
som Festival, and the Cherry Blos-
som Festival.

Jones is leaving for Vietnam in
December, and before he goes, he is
hoping to see the formation of a
strong University band, and hopes
that the possibility will grow dis-
tinct that at least one of those invita-
tions will be accepted,

Bottles: Vexing, Shameful

When this column was conceived, there was one
word which was used to describe it: “horrible!” Of
course, soemebody else came up with the idea of referr-
ing to its as “space to fill,” and that’s just what it's
going to have to be, Frankly, there just hasn't been very
much happening around here. and | just don't have
hardly anything at all to write about, Sometimes |
wonder how "ve stood it as long as | have, or how
YOU'VE stood it as long as you have

Well, anyway, yesterday I was walking in the fresh-
men dorms, (Actually, it wasn't yesterday, or at any
rate it went be when you fread this. This business of
writing my column a whole two days before the paper

really “getting me down,” as we in the journalism game

the average student would have more pride in his school
than that, and so | went around and picked up every

took them away from me and accused me of stealing

As | was walking to class yesterday, | was continu-
ously bothered by a dry, crackling sound. On further
investigation, | discovered it was caused by students
walking on the leaves which have fallen off the trees
ill over the campus (you must have seen these trees.
they're very tall and brown and have little varmints in
them that look like field mice with powder puffs on).
“Now this,” | suid to myself (forcefully and with auth-
ority, because that's what it takes to be a leader: but
also quietly, because if somebody heard me they might
decide that | needed a long rest and lock me in the
paper office for days on end), “is a problem which calls
for quick action.” So I figured it out that either the
leaves could be wired onto the trees, the little field
mice-in-drag could be trained to hold the leaves in
place. or the whole school could be shut down from
October to mid-January. This last would probably be
best. as very few janitors would be willing to climb
high enough to do any kind of wiring job at all, and the
mice don't loo trustworthy, They have a shifty
look about them, and would most likely drop all the

leaves simultaneously, thus burying the school for

RING-TUM PHI

Sewanee To Be Host

Ever the pessimist, Washington
and Lee football coach Buck Leslie
can’t understand how this week’s op-
ponent, Sewanee, is winless in six
games.

“From looking at the films, I don’t
see how they lost every game,” Les-
lie commented. “They look pretty
good to me. I do know they've play-
ed some good teams.”

From now on, those around Leslie
will take him seriously when he frets
before a game. The day before last
Saturday's tilt with Bridgewater, Les-
lie spent the whole day pacing, the
worry furrows in his wide forehead
very much in evidence.

Others in the W&L athletic camp
thought the coach’s concern was per-
haps unnecessary, but Saturday's

tough 10-6 escape at Bridgewater
proved Leslie was right.

“Sewanee is always up for us, no
matter what kind of record they
have,” Leslie noted. “In the films,
they throw the ball real well, much
better than last year (when the Gen-
erals upset the Tigers, 16-7),”

On top of that, the game is atop
Sewanee’s mountainous campus, and
the Tigers are always tough at home.
However, W&L—in a complete re-
versal of recent form—has achieved
all of its three victories this year on
the road. All three losses have been
at home.

Injuries will be a key factor. W&L
has lost several veteran starters and
must rely on freshmen at center and

Yow’s Goal Gives W&l Tie

The Washington and Lee soccer team continued its quest

for a VISA (Virginia Intercollegiate Soccer Association)

tournament bid by tying Eastern Mennonite on John Yow’s
last-second goal. The 1-1 tie kept W&L tied with Roanoke in
the loss column for the Western Division lead of the VISA.

The trademark of the W&L Soc-
cer Generals this year has been a
spirited, enthusiastic self-confidence,
As Coach Lyles has stressed many
times, “This team is young, but the
players believe in themselves and
their abilities. You won't find them
letting up in any of the games.”
These words were proven to be 100
per cent correct last Tuesday in
W&L’s game with Eastern Men-
nonite as the Generals scrapped un-
til the closing moments of the
game, the effort paying off in John
Yow’s game-tying goal with one sec-
ond remaining in the game,

Fullback Brian Price started what
would have to have been W&L’s
last offensive drive with twenty sec-
onds left in the game. Price brought
the ball to midfield where he passed
to inside left Don Belt. Belt then
drilled the ball toward the Eastern
Mennonite goal. Meade Kampf-
mueller, up for a head shot, collided

with the E-M goalie. The ball angled
off to Yow who quickly tied the
game.

Eastern Mennonite was the aggres-
sor for much of the game. The W&L
defense, playing their usual out-
standing game, prompted coach
Lyles to say, “This has to be the
best set of fullbacks in the state.”
W&L goalie Ken Newman had 27
saves,

The tie gave W&L an overall rec-
ord of 5-1-2, but the team stayed
tied with Roanoke in the important
loss column. Both W&L and Roa-
noke are vying for the Western Divi-
sion berth in the VISA tournament.
The Western division champion will
go against Virginia, the probable
E

certain that W&L would
avenge its earlier 2-1 loss to Vir-
ginia in that championship game.

The activities of the Young Re-
publicans in Virginia’s guberna-
torial campaign, which — included
bringing Republican gubernatorial
candidate Linwood Holton to speak
here last week, were brought to a
close Tuesday, according to YR
campaign manager Cal Seaton.

The YR’s activities also included
two canvasses of the Lexington com-
munity—the second concentrating on
the black portion of the community;
a mixer after Nixon’s speech, and a
party at the Phi Delta Theta fra-
ternity house.
