LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, JANUARY 13, 1970

Number 25

Merger is planned for newspapers

The Publications Board recently
adopted sweeping changes concern-
ing the character of The Ring-tum
Phi, including consolidation of the
two present Editions effective March
:,

The proposed changes came after
a month of intensive self-study of
the newspaper by a four-man Publi-
cations Board subcommittee compos-
ed of the two current editors. Bob
Entzminger and Bob Yevich, Pro-
fessor Paxton Davis, faculty repre-
sentative, and Reed Byrum, Calyx
Business Manager.

The Board approved the resolu-
tions of the subcommittee that be-
ginning with the first Thursday in
March, The Ring-tum Phi be pub-
lished once a week by a combined
staff, and that beginning for the
academic year 1970-1971, the Board

Friends of Distinction to perform before
Friday night audience at Fancy Dress

Plans for Fancy Dress Weekend
reached the terminal stage when it
was confirmed that the Friends of
Distinction would appear in the Fri-
day night concert. This completes
the lineup for W&L’s biggest social
event of 1970.

The nationally acclaimed Friends
of Distinction will be followed by
Buddy DeFranco and the world
famous Glenn Miller Orchestra on
Saturday night. The band of renown
will perform at the Fancy Dress
Ball from nine until one o'clock,

Fancy Dress President Martin
Bass has announced that the theme
for the 1970 Fancy Dress Ball will
be Camelot. To effect such a theme,
Evans Dining Hall will undergo a
dramatic change. The ten columns
will be adorned with coats-of-arms
and the balcony, where the faculty
is traditionally seated, will be deco-
rated as a jousting box. Plans are
still being contemplated for a back-
drop behind the orchestra. Black tie
will be in order for the occasion.

Assembly Notice

The Lee's Birthday — Founders’
Day Convocation will be held at
noon on Monday, January 19, in
Doremus Gymnasium. No examina-
tions will be held on this day.

Professor Norman A. Graebner,
Edward R. Stettinius Professor of
History, University of Virginia, will
deliver the address.

Attendance of all students is re-
quired. The faculty will wear aca-
demic costume. Students are request-
ed to be in their seats before 12
o'clock so that the assembly can be-
gin promiply. The faculty will as-
semble in the basement of Doremus
Gymnasium at 11:30 to robe for
the procession.

During the second week of Feb
ruary, the “maleness” of all-male
Washington and Lee will be chal-
lenged. The ancient masculine at-
mosphere will be broken by the
sound of feminine conversation and
the sight of mini-skirts

Brought to the campus by “Con
tact", 120 girls from Mary Baldwin,
Hollins, Randolph-Macon and Sweet
Briar will become Washington and
Lee students for the week of Febru
ary 8-14

The 120 girls will be the center at
traction of the first “Coeducation
Week” at 1400-student WAL. The
University is currently pondering
whether coeducation should become
a permanent feature of the Lexing
lon campus

Coed Week will be offered a» part

of the fifth annual “Contact” pro
gram, “Contact”, a week-long sym
posium series, is operated by the

Contact Committee
through the Interfraternity Council
to stimulate intellectual debate and
discussion of pressing issues

In addition to initiating this limil
ed experiment in coeducation at
WAL, the “Contact” program will
once again bring to the campus the
popular intellectual symposiums fea
turing nationally prominent speaker

Speakers slated for this year’s
program include: Ramsey Clark, al
United States

William A. Rush

 

The Cock-pit will be open dur-
ing the Ball and students will be
able to drink beer within the tav-
ern, Stronger spirits will be pro-
hibited on the premises.

The Fancy Dress Vice-Presidents
have also been announced. They
are Chuck Dobbins, John Miller,
Dan Leonard, Charles Stone, Homer
Gamble, John Philips, Ken Wallace,

Foster Galliard, Steve Waldron,
Waugh Crigler, and Bob Entz-
minger. They will be introduced

with the fraternity presidents and
the Fancy Dress President by Presi-
dent Huntley.

The University cocktail party will
be from 2:30-5:30 p.m. at the Herit-
age House and gin fizzes will be
served, departing from the cus-
tomary grain bunch. The Embers
will perform.

Following the cocktail party on
Friday, the Friends of Distinction
will perform at Doremus Gym at
8:00 p.m.

The Friends of Distinction made
their professional debut at the Daisy,
one of Hollywood's top discothe-

ques. There they attracted the at-
tention of actor Jim Brown who
signed them to his management

firm. They have since recorded the
hit singles “Grazin in the Grass”
and “Going in Circles,” and their
third album is scheduled for release
in April. The group consists of
Harry Elston, the group's writer:
Floyd Butler: Jessica Cleaves: and
Barbra Jean Love, daughter of the
famed west coast D. J. Reuben
Brown.

Phis past summer the Friends of
Distinction produced their second
album “The Highly Distinet
Friends of Distinction.” Among its
hits are “It's Sunday,” “Let Your-
self Go,” “It's a Wonderful World,”

“Why Did I Lose You,” and “This
Generation.” Their first album
“Grazin” based upon the notable hit
of Hugh Masekela, “Grazin’ in the
Grass.”

Fuxedos will be offered for their
rental by the Oak Hill Costume
Company of Staunton, Virginia in
the main meeting room, No. 114, of
the Student Union; representatives
from the company will be present
from 1:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m., on
Wednesday, February 14. Those stu-
dents who have not had the oppor-
tunity as yet to rent attire for the
Fancy Dress Ball will be able to do
so al this time.

lickets for both nights will be on
sale in the Co-op,

elect one Editor-in-Chief for the
newspaper.

The weekly edition will be pub-
lished in a format of six pages with
a possible reduction, if necessary, to
four pages during the proposed short
term periods.

The Board also passed a resolu-
tion stipulating a more systematic
and dependable manner of circula-
tion for the paper, as well as a cor-
responding increase in the press run.
In keeping with this resolution more
copies of each edition will be distri-
buted to the Commons, fraternities,
and the Law School. It was also de-
cided to purchase distribution racks,
such as those used by commercial
papers, to be placed in the co-op,
Library and Student Center.

In order to facilitate the transi-
tion of authority to next year’s Edi-
tor, the Board decided to effect con-
solidation in March. This will allow
two months of experience in pub-
lishing a six-page weekly before the
new Editor takes over in May, The
paper will be under the joint editor-
ship of the current two Editors after
March 1.

Since the undergraduate member-
ship of the Board will be reduced
beginning next year, the Board voted
to abolish the position of alumni
representative at the end of this
year. However, to give the Publica-
tions Board greater continuity in the
future, the term of office for the
position of faculty representative
was lengthened from two to five
years.

The Board also adopted certain
guidelines pertinent to qualifications
for election to the editorship, staff
organization, and editorial respon-
sibility.

Six general reasons were cited in
the subcommittee report for fe-

IFC ponders Contact, rush

By Mack Woodward

The IFC discussed several topics
of interest last night: the amend-
ment to their constitution, the de-
layed rush program, and Contact,

The proposal which provides for
the direct popular election of the
president of the IFC was passed.
This election will take place at the
same time as the elections normally
held in the spring.

Although no action was taken, the
council did discuss the delayed rush
program. Suggestions were made for
the way rush is to be conducted. A
concentrated rush, such as we have
now, will be discouraged, although
one or two days of open houses
could possibly be held before classes
start. President Cahn called for any
ideas from each of the houses and
urged that they be brought before
the next IFC meeting.

commending consolidation of the
two Ring-tum Phis. They are as fol-
lows:

1. The consolidation of the two
present staffs would improve the
overall qaulity of writing in the
paper, since more time would be
devoted to writing and editing copy.

2. The paper would serve its read-
ers better by providing enhanced
coverage of newsworthy events,

3. The danger of being under-
staffed during the short-term periods
would be lessened with an enlarged
staff,

4. The increasing cost of publish-
ing The Ring-tum Phi; a six page
edition would show a savings.

5. Problems of distribution and
readership of the Friday Edition
(because of the five-day class week)
would be obviated with a Thursday
Edition,

6. These recommendations would
enhance the status of working on
The Ring-tum Phi both as Editor
and especially as an underclassman.
Understaffing has become an_in-
creasingly difficult problem over the
past few years,

Planning & development
committee to be created

By Roy Carlton

The Executive Committee is con-
sidering four issues of such impor-
tance that two of them would re-
quire constitutional amendments, Of
the four, two were brought to a
vote and one passed.

The tabled motion had been in-
troduced by Freshman representa-
tive Alan Prater and concerned the
composition of the EC should mem-
bers leave for short term study. An-
other motion was passed to form a
permanent standing committee to
study planning and development.

The other two topics concerned
the status of the Ring-tum Phi. The
first gave EC approval to the es-
tablishment of a single weekly Ring-
tum Phi this spring. The second topic
was a motion and was defeated. It
dealt with the Executive Commit-
tee’s financial and policy-making
supervision of the Publications
Board.

Prater’s proposal sought to rem-
edy a possible future dilemma in
the event that EC members might
leave campus during short terms.
Prater asked that such an Executive
Committeeman be replaced by the
President of that class, and, in the
event that both representatives were
gone, that the second space be filled
by the class Vice-President. The mo-
tion was not brought to a vote in
order that the EC could consider
other alternatives such as the in-
stitution of special elections

Student Body Vice-President Joe
fompkins proffered a motion
drawn up by the subcommitice on
planning and development. It called
for the institution of a permanent
standing committee called the Stu
dent Planning and Development
Committee and would be headed by
a three man steering committee of
EC members.

These members would serve one-
year terms and could succeed them-
selves. The committee would be
filled out by the four undergraduate
class presidents and a Law School

time before May. Th initial steer-

Publications Board President
Larry Honig presented a Board re-
solution to the EC for its approval.
The resolution is described in the
above article and concerns the con-
consolidation of the Ring-tum Phi
and changes in editor's salaries.
There were no objections as the EC
approved the measures.

Following this, Honig asked that
the EC move along the lines of an-
other Publications Board resolution
calling for a special committee to
annually determine the Board's
share of the student tax, and to end
the EC's powers of appellate juris-
diction over that Board. It was felt
that such a check in the hands of the
EC might ultimately lead to Execu-
tive Committee manipulations in
editor elections and censorship of
the Ring-tum Phi.

The section moving for financial
independence from the EC was de-
leted after the full motion, proposed
by Kevin Baker, failed to receive a
second, The revised motion would
have removed only the EC's ap-
pellate jurisdiction over Publications
Board actions. Because it would en-
tail a constitutional amendment. a
two-thirds vote was required for
passage. Kevin Baker proposed the
motion and Alan Prater seconded it.
The measure fell two votes short as
Azuma, Baker, Bethea, Ogilvie, Pra-
ter and Thompson voted for it while
Dobbins, Kumpuris, and lfompkins
opposed it. Bill Andrews abstained.

THE RING-TUM PHI

THE RING-TUM PHI

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition
Tuesday, January 13, 1970

Maintain admissions standards

Staff Editorial

While we share The Friday Ring-tum Phi’s encourage-
ment for the student subcommittee on admissions’ endeavors,
we do question the objectives of that group.

We are cognizant of the valuable educational experience
that we at W&L are being deprived of, the experience of
gaining associations with students from different racial and
socio-economic backgrounds than our own. We realize the
college should be a full learning experience, and that ex-
perience should not be limited to the classroom. We also
realize the social responsibilities that make seeking such stu-

dents imperative.

We failed to note the “rather sweeping innovations in
admissions, recruiting and orientation programs” that The
Friday Edition alleged were discussed. We also failed to
recognize their report as ranking “in approach with among
the most thorough, penetrating and constructive studies we
have seen undertaken here.” We were impressed with their
enthusiasm and the range of their ideas.

The report consisted of five reports from the subcom-
mittees appointed by Executive Committeeman Dave Bethea.
The reports were rhetorical and did not include any formal
proposals; only tentative avenues of research.

One point that was repeatedly brought out by the speak-
ers was the necessity for the University’s Admissions Office
to “change” the admissions requirements. This was cited as
necessary in order to attract underprivileged applicants,
specifically blacks, since W&L cannot compete with the Ivy
League schools for the applicants who would qualify under
present admissions policies. The term “change,” said the
speakers, does not necessarily imply lowering admissions

standards.

We feel that a “change,” as such, would imply a lowering
of admissions standards. Spokesman Pleas Geyer cited an
example of a high school senior in northern Virginia in a
rural school district who had an SAT total score below 800
and, until recently, had a troublesome scholastic record. The
student had been interviewed by a W&L faculty representa-
tive who discovered that he had a great intellectual curiosity,
and he was recommended highly to the admissions depart-

ment.

Geyer recommended using different criteria in interpret-
ting students’ applications and suggested that such a student
as the above would be a good prospect for Washington and
Lee. We feel that using a criterion such as intellectual promise
alone would ultimately lower the school’s academic standing.
This is certainly not fair to the students who entered W&L
to compete with other students of their own intellectual
capability and receive the kind of stimulation afforded by
that kind of competition. Also, it is certainly not fair to
bring a student to W&L with a comparatively deficient educa-
tion and expect him to compete with his fellow students.

We applaud the subcommittee on admissions on their
determination to take up a task that should have received
attention long ago. However, we urge them to act with
restraint in recommending admissions department policy. We
feel that W&L is in a position to seek underprivilged students
that qualify under present admission standards. The Uni-
versity can offer financial aid to these students and this sub-
committee judiciously plans to seek more. Certainly, every
qualified underprivileged student is not going to Harvard,

Yale, or Princeton.

Coeducation: a week now;
a reality in the future?

By LAURENCE M, HILLIARD
Columnist

In my first column for the Ring
tum Phi, written a little less than
one year ago, | presented some argu
ments for coeducation at Washing
ton and Lee. At the time it was
just a pipedream, Next month, co
education will become a reality, at
least for one week

Coeducation Week was the fore
runner of coeducation at Princeton,
Yale and other colleges steeped in
+ wnisexual tradition, It could be
the same at WAl

On hundred and twenty college
beauties—30 each from Hollins,
Sweet Briar, Randolph-Macon Wo
men's College, and Mary Baldwin
will descend upon the WAL campus
for the week of Contact Besides
enjoying the excellent speakers lined
up for Contact, th WAL coeds will
stiend classes and do everything else
the WAL gentleman does, (Well just
about everything’)

Of course this doesn't mean that
we can look forward to coeducation
next year, First the University plans
to cooperate with seven other non
coeducational colleges im an ex
change program: if the Board of
Trustees approves the program. Such
in exchange program will bring 40
students from other colleges to WAL
for one vear of study while send
ing 40 WAL. students to other col
leges. The program will be experi
ment in coeducation, and hopefully

it will lead to the Real MeCoy

Coeducation Week is part of a
progressive trend that has swept the
campus during the past four years
My freshman year, the big deal was
the elimination of Saturday classes
on dance weekends, Since then, we
have witnessed th total elimination
of Saturday clasess, the introduction
of pass/fail courses, liberalization
of distribution requirements, parent-
ials in the dorms, complete elimi-
nation of restrictions on student
ownership of automobiles, and start-
ing next year, a new academic
calendar that will allow independent
study and of course the exchange
program

Also, the new Student union was
completed and, if | can believe Bill
Tyler, and | assume | can, con-
struction will begin on the new
gymnasium in early spring

This progress—and it is consid
erable progress——is due to an en
lightened faculty and a concerned
student body, The WAL stud is now
concerned with more than just get
ting down the road every weekend
He is concerned with what is hap
pening around him on campus and
in the world

Changes, where they are needed,
will continue at WAL, because the
days of total student apathy are in
the past. And before too long it's
posible that the WAL student will
not have to go down the road to
get a date

Co-op’s Cokes
top a thousand,
milkshakes 500

The lines in the Washington and
Lee University fight song, the
“Swing,” begin: “When Washington
and Lee men fall in line. . .”

It doesn’t refer to the chow line,
but it well might,

Just for snacks, the University’s
1,400 students—aided by some fac-
ulty and administration members—
consume 180 hot dogs, 80 ham-
burgers, and 40 cheeseburgers a
day.

Approximately 100 chicken salad
sandwiches go over the counter,
along with almost that many egg
salad sandwiches.

Add to the daily menu 20 pounds
of french fries, 100 cakes, five dozen
English muffins, assorted things to
nibble such as ¢@rackers and potato
chips, and specialty sandwiches
such as roast beef and corned beef.

All this is washed down with
1,000 sodas, 500 milkshakes, about
10 gallons of milk, nine gallons of
orange juice, and 450 cups of coffee.
(It's one of the country’s few re-
maining S-cent cups of coffee.)

Those quantities of food and
drink are dispensed daily at the
Snackbar of the University Supply
Store. The figures would be astro-
nomical as well as gastronomical if
they included the full-fledged meals
taken at the University Dining Hall,
the 18 fraternity houses, apartments,
and private dining establishments in
or near Lexington,

“The hot dogs start selling the
first thing in the morning,” said Mrs.
Famie Smothers. During her 17
years of service in Washington and
Lee snack shops, Mrs. Smothers has
learned to take such exotic student
dining habits as the 7:30 a.m. hot
dog breakfast for granted.

Mrs. Smothers has the busy job
of keeping the Snackbar supplied
with enough food to feed the
hungry between-class hordes.

At another location on campus,
short-order sandwiches, along with
beer, are being served for the first
time this semester. The new facility
is the tavern of the University
Center, which opened this fall.

Political and social interests of
college students may fluctuate, but
“no matter what college you go to,
you're going to find plenty of
hungry students,” quipped James E.
Toler, manager of the University
Supply Store.

Toler, a native of Hopewell, was
for six year the manager of a book
store and snackbar at Ferrum Junior
College. He came to Washington
and Lee last summer from a posi-
tion as assistant manager of the
Salem-Roanoke Valley Civic Center
in Roanoke.

Student apartments in farmhouse
burned in holiday conflagration

For Washington and Lee students,
the end of Christmas vacation sig-
nals the beginning of exams and
the start of another long semester.
That is a sobering enough experi-
ence for most students, but the re-
cent experience of seven W&L sen-
iors is without precedent.

PiKA fourth-year men, Razz Ras-
berry, Mel Cartwright, Tom Rob-
son, Bryan Baldwin, Bert Roby,
Pete Wilson and Bill Wigglesworth
left for home anticipating a happy
holiday only to have their hopes
ruined on December 23 by news of
a fire in their Lexington apartment
the night before.

The seven had been living in a
spacious ten-room farmhouse on the
Maury River, but the holiday fire
burnt it to the ground in what the
Lexington Fire Department term-

Deferred rush and autos
threaten intellectualism

By MACK WOODWARD

Last Monday, the faculty approv-
ed two measures for next year: an
extended rush period of seven weeks
and the approval of freshman cars.
While these measures are liberal
changes, they do not seem in keep-
ing with the faculty's policy of pro-
moting intellectual activity on this
campus,

The extended rush period, while
giving both the fraternities and the
freshmen a better chance to ac-
quaint themselves with one another,
will present a problem in its length.
Seven weeks will cover more than
half of the first semester, which will
be oniy twelve weeks next year.

Under the present rushing sysim.
there is only one class day during
the rush period. Undoubtedly,
formal rush parties will be held
only on weekends, but informa!
rushing will no doubt take place
Monday through Friday as well
While this places a burden on the
freshmen, it places an even greater
burden on the upperclassmen con-
ducting rush, This can only lead to
a further diversion of the atientions
of fraternity men, attentions which
would be better spent on academics,
especially toward the end of the
rush period when many mid-semester
hour quizzes will be taking place

The issue of freshman cars, like
deferred rush, has its superficial
benefits: freshmen will not be forced
to join a fraternity just to meet
people who have cars so that they,
too, may go down the road, Fresh
men, however, are an eager and
generally irresponsible bunch. (This
is not to say that there are not
sophomores, juniors, and seniors
who are completely removed from
this category.) All have been under
either their parents close watch or
the even closer watch of a boarding
school, They tend to be a bil more
relaxed and lew conscious about
their studying. At WAL, freshman
grades on the whole have been de
clining for at least the past three

years. With easier access to a car,
freshmen will be even more tempted
to let their assignments build up
and their grades drop.

Either of these factors adopted at
separate times would call for a
period of adjustment; taken together,
these measures pose a major prob-
lem. Rush is all too material in
many aspects now; decisions are
made based upon well-adjusted ties,
the proper tweeds, and even Dun
and Bradstreet ratings. It is incon-
ceivable that some—if not all-—fra-
ternities will not rush certain men
upon the basis of their owning a
car and the type of car they own.
This is certainly no sound basis for
selecting pledges

The motivation behind the pas-
sage of these two measures is cer-
tainly not to promote intellectual
activity While there are other bene
fits to be reaped from college ex-
perience, intellectual activity is the
primary reason for obtaining a col
lege education

The Tuesday

burns we've ever seen.” The cause
of the blaze is as yet undertermined.

All of the students returned early
hoping to be able to salvage some-
thing, but found nothing but a
charred frame and toppled bricks.
Thus, they face the incredible task
of replacing items valued at close
to $19,000. The losses include
clothes, component stereo systems,
televisions, guns, furniture and,
most importantly, all their notes
and books.

One of the group was lucky, how-
ever. Bill Wigglesworth had been
occupying a remodeled smokehouse
in the back of the main building.
Most of his possessions were in this
building which was untouched by
the flames.

The other six are now living in
scattered apartments and in their
fraternity house. They are attempt-
ing to get settled before what
promises to be a difficult’ exam
period. Efforts to locate more perm-
anent housing for second semester
have so far proved unsuccessful.

The boys liivng in the farmhouse
were not the only ones to be upset
by the blaze. Pikas have lived in
the “farm” for several years with
each graduating group of tenants
bringing in a new bunch of under-
classmen. Through the years im-
provements were added and it be-
came a gathering place for Pikas,

Need for pride
seen as helpful
to W6EL legacy

By LARRY HONIG

It feels good to return to writ-
ing for W&L’s version of the mass
media—my effort, though, will not
be in the realm of things pro-
vocative for those are best left as
perquisites of the Editor.

I choose to make public my long-
standing (and obviously futile) dis-
taste for the less sublime but more
obvious personal characteristics of
what is becoming too large a seg-
ment of the student body. I am
referring to the _ briefly-lamented
death of the speaking tradition and
conventional dress.

For those readers who have not
quit by having dismissed me as an
Establishment Ass, let me continue.
C. Turner is a senior here—he was,
long ago, an SAE; since those “old
days,” C. has turned to (among
Other things) voicing the individu-
al’s right to dress as he pleases, ete.

But unfortunately for W&L, C.
Turner's example has been only
partially emulated. We have, | would
guess, about 600 or more students
today (about 595 more than when
I was a freshman) who 1) are never
courteous, and 2) usually dress be-
low any reasonably civilized stand-
ards,

These people, however, fit none
of the criteria set forth numerously
by C. You see, C. speaks to people,
even if he doesn't like them and
even when he thinks he might not;
he greets fellow students, professors,
and visitors alike—lI’ve seen him—
with casual cordiality; and he doesn't
go out of his way to look bad—
never a tie, to be sure, but then
again, never personally offensive
clothing.

Those who would say “So what”
or “big deal” or “go to hell” are
those to whom this article, those
qualities, and, ultimately, this Uni-
versity are meaningless except in a
very narrow concept. If I may be
allowed to repeat what you must
have expected me to say. It doesn't
hurt to speak, and to dress neatly.

Establishment? Well, think about
it in your half-million-dollar Student
Center—or in class: you could go
to State U. and on the difference
in tuition feed ove million starving
Biafrans for a yeay.

It seems to me that there is some-
thing more to non-formal education
than your beliefs, prejudices, and
philosophy, and that's inter-relation-
ships serving in the past to generate
a fantastic pride in this University.

At a loss for noble words myself,
permit me to quote from an article
by Professor Gunn in the Student
Handbook:

“Almost all students want this
University to be distinctive. It is
an ironic fact that many would
forfeit the very things that have
given it distinction, rather than
make the small effort needed in
adjusting their personal habits to
mainiain the high standards of
the past,”

It would be most helpful to the
legacy of this University if more of
her students could develop some
pride in values more permanent than
proving to themselves they know
where it’s at.

Benefits of work-study program
questioned in certain instances

By DAVID HIGGINS
Columnist

Through my own observations
and afier talks with several stu
dents, it has come to my attention
that, in some instances at least, the
term “work-study” is a misnomer

Some students who enjoy the fi
nancial benefit of this program are
finding that they not only do not
study in any real sense but they
also have to do menial jobs which

are paid to do. This in itself is
perhaps not so reprehensible as the
fact that some of these students are
treated much like hired help with-
out intelligence or self-respect

There is absolutely no reason for
any professor to degrade or em-
barass a student in front of his
fellow classmates Teachers are
human and do lose their temper at
times, But when they “jump on”
a student triyng to do his job for
them, they not only lose all respect
in that student's eyes but they also
lose a great deal of dignity in the
eyes of the students who happen
to overhear the outburst

Instances such as this are by far
the exception to the general rule.
but when even one student comes
home after working in the afternoon
and he feels embarassed and angry
because of what he considers an
injustice, then the student-faculty
relationship suffers

If a professor feels that a student

making uncalled for mistakes,
then he should admonish that stu
dent in a gentlemanly manner. Too
often a student says “ves sir” in
reply to a comment which does not
reflect the respect which the “sir
implies. Then too professors ca
studenis “Mr. Smith” when “little
bov" would be much more approp
ite. But as always, a person's feel
nes should be considered first, and

if this is done perhaps sweeping a

W&L scuttles Navy

In last year’s basketball season
W&L squeaked by Navy 60-59.
Many felt that Navy was truthfully
surprised by that young upstart team
from Virginia. It was agreed on
that this year Navy would be wait-
ing on the Generals’ invasion and
the better team would surely win
this time. Well that is exactly what
happened. A_ better team from
Washington and Lee ran stunned
Navy out of their own gym in the
second half to the tune of 70-56.

In an effort to beef up W&L’s
schedule with more major college
competition, Coach Canfield had
singled out Navy this winter, The
midshipmen were a fine team. This
year the Middies challenged power-
ful Kentucky at Kentucky and were
turned back by a 14 point margin.
If you want to compare scores that
is the same edge the Generals tal-
leyed against Navy. But regardless
of Navy's ability they could not lick
Washington and Lee’s discipline and
ball control.

John Conrad sparkplugged the
Naval Academy attack in the first
half. Outside shooting was a dis-
appointment for the Navymen and
their whole offense stagnated. The
pressing defense developed by the
home squad did cause turnovers but
could not halt an aggressive bunch
from Lexington.

For the boys in blue ball control
was the key in the first 20 minutes,
Rebounding was not quite up to
par but nice passing and heads-up
play kept the Generals on top by a
pair of field goals 37-32,

Ellie Gutshall ingnited an offen-
sive show in the second half. The
speedy sophomore hit the open man
accurately and crashed the boards
like a giant. Ellie's play encouraged
the rest of the Blue team and things
were going Washington and Lee’s
way for the remainder of the game.

Neer went to the boards more
with his sidekick Mel Cartwright.

U.Va. wins meet

Ihe General natators, unable to
put down a late Cavalier rally,
were defeated by a 55-49 margin
for their second loss of the year.
Freshman Alan Corwith and Bim
Clark continued their record break-
ing season setting new team records
and U.Va. pool records in the 200
yard freestyle and butterfly events.

The graduation of All-American
Billy Ball and the weakness in the
backstroke and breaststroke events
was apparent as the Cavaliers swept
the last three events— the 200 back-
stroke, 500 freestyle, and 200 yard
breastroke—capturing both first and
second in these events. The Gen-
erals led in the meet until the last
three events when U.Va. pulled
ahead.

The 400 yard medley relay team
of co-captain Roger Martin, Price
Blackford, Bim Clark and Bill
Brumback won the opening event
John Lawlor followed with a second
in the 1000 yard freestyle. Corwith
then won the 200 yard freestyle
with his record breaking perform
ance of 1:53.2 seconds. Both Brum
back and Clark had a 23.2 second
time in the 50 freestyle, but the
judges gave the first place to Brum-
back. Catlin then scored a second
in the 200 yard individual medley
Going into the diving
had a 26-16 point lead

U.Va. swept the first two places
in the diving. Bim Clark and Bert
Meem then captured first and third

his resulted in a single shot for
the Navy team. Neer used his size
and jumping ability to successfully
intimidate the Middies into poor
shots,

Foul trouble killed the Annapolis
five. A bonus situation developed
early in the final period. Not being
a team to let opportunity pass it by,
W&L cashed in on 25 free throws
at the foul line. With Navy’s start-
ing quintet in foul trouble, Wash-
ington and Lee exploded.

Isolating the Navy defenders was
Canfield’s plan. His offense was
based on individual man-on-man
plays and ball control, Poise and
alertness neutralized the press in-
strumented by Navy most of the
game.

he balanced scoring went like

this: Daniel 16, Cartwright and
Neer 14, and Morrison 8.
Last night W&L demolished

Emory and Henry 82-52. Utilizing a
man-to-man defense and a 1-4
double low post offense, the Gen-
erals scored at will.

Emory and Henry could not get
back on defense quickly and this
hurt the visitors. Bill Rhyne and
Ellie Gutshall hurried the Generals
down the floor. The black line re-
bounded excellently especially on
the defensive boards. Outside shoot
ing was another plus factor for
Washington and Lee with Gutshall,
Rhyne and = Cartwright
nothing but nylon,

In the closing minutes many of

hitting

the relief players did well. Dave
Stone, Paul McClure and John
Glace kept the ball rolling for

W&L.

The key to the win was an ex
plosive offense. The fast break and
fine shooting made the difference.
Speed and bench depth are definite
assets for Canfield’s corps this year

Home loss pinned gn wrestlers

WA&L’s varsity wrestling team once
again met defeat as they went down
to the forces of state rival Hamp-
den-Sydney. After a long Christmas
layoff, the team seemed sluggish as
only three men men were able to
win individual matches. Wade Goarl,
Bill West, and Dave Higgins scored
the only Washington and Lee points.
Credit should also be given to fresh-
man Mike Newcomb.

The highlight of the night came
as tri-captain Dave Higgins pinned
his man. The match was_high-
lighted by fast thinking and quick
moves. After one such move, Hig-
gins could be seen hastily stuffing

Dance Board purchases speaker
system to alleviate audio problems

The Dance Board has purchased
a new speaker system for its con-
certs in answer to numerous com-
plaints by the student body con-
cerning audio difficulties.

In an attempt to improve the
quality of the concerts, Dean Kum-
puris, president of the Dance Board,
has sought during the past several
months a solution for the poor

in the 200 yard dolphin butterfly.
Clark’s record time in this event
was 2:11.9. Corwith then won his
second individual event of the day,
the 100 yard freestyle with a 51.9
time. The Generals now led 39-31
and the roof fell in. The Cavaliers
won the 200 yard backstroke, the
500 yard freestyle, and clinched the
overall victory by winning the 200
yard breaststroke. Martin, Corwith,
Catlin, and Brumback then com-
bined to win the final 400 yard free-
style relay.

The General's record now stands
at 2-2 as they begin their exam

sound system. After much investiga-
tion Kumpuris contracted the Moses
Company of Little Rock, Arkansas
to fufill the audio needs of Doremus
Gymnasium in the most adequate
and economical manner.

Two Klipsch La Scala speakers
were purchased and will be placed
on the right and left sides of the
indoor track, facing the entrance to
the athletic complex. This speaker
model, k-447, is a_ high-efficiency
low-distortion system covering a
wide range of frequencies with an
unusually smooth response. Bass
range extends to 50 cps, usable to
40. In spite of the quality, size has
been brought to such a minimum
as to classify this speaker system
as a “miniature” among speakers
of this style. Although the woofer
unit occupies only 8 cubic feet, the
response, range and efficiency equal
or exceed systems of considerably
larger size. This loudspeaker affords
the same efficiency, smoothness of
response, and freedom from distor-
tion as the Klipschorn but the bass
cutoff is approximately 20 cps
higher. It has 40-19,000 cps range
and a 70 watt capacity.

The Klipsch Corporation is one
of the finest producers of hi-fi com-
ponents in the nation; its products
have been exhibited by the United
States in the Brussels World Fair
and the Moscow World Fair as fine
cratsmanship in hifidelity. It is
based in Hope, Arkansas and is the
producer of the Klipschorn.

news from the
world of music

By GENTRY FERRELL

“The Masked Marauders,” a new
album rumored to feature Lennon
and McCartney, Dylan, George
Harrison, and Mick Jagger in some
sort of super-coalition, is a colossal
put-on. None of those illustrious
figures appear but their individual
styles do receive excellent treatment
in what may become one of the
year’s best-selling albums.

Bob Dylan is particularly well
treated in original Masked Maraud-
ers’ compositions such as “Cow Pie”
and “More or Lee Hudson's Bay
Again.” “Cow Pie,” an instrumental,
is very reminiscent of “I Threw
It All Away” on Dylan’s own
“Nashville Skyline” album, while
“Hudson’s Bay” is so akin to his
“Tell Me That It Isn't True” that
this writer wonders seriously whether
The Band, Dylan's former back-up
group, was involved in the produc-
tion of this new album.

Jagger's frenzied style is duplicat-
ed in “I Can't Get No Nookie” and
the Marauders’ version of “Season
of the Witch” captures the styles of
Blood, Sweat and Tears, the now-
defunct Buffalo Springfield, and the
guitar of Beatle George Harrison.
Even the high-camp “Duke of Earl”
receives an enjoyable fresh treat-
ment,

“The Masked Marauders” is sig-
nificant not only for its approach
to standard rock styles but also be-
cause it brings into the public view
a new group of talented musicians
who, without the fanfare of the
‘super-coalition’ rumor, might other-
wise have gone unnoticed. Their
efforts on this album indicate that
they have the potential to become
a successful group without the
trappings of imitation, secrecy and
public speculation,

News From the Music World:

The Beatles’ “Get Back” album
should be released sometime this
month. John Lennon says they will
probably never tour as a group
again, despite rumors that they
would appear in Baltimore next
month . Burt Bacharach and
Hal David, composers of “Promises,
Promises” and “I'll Never Fall in
Love Again” for Dionne Warwick,
will soon set up sessions with B. J.
Thomas ... Films of the Rolling
Stones’ concert in San Francisco
have been subpoenaed by a Cali-
fornia court because they show a
fatal encounter between a black
youth and Hell’s Angels . . . Rumor
has it that Blood, Sweat and Tears
will appear at Central Virginia Com-
munity College in Lynchburg. Ne-
gotiations are under way .. . The
‘West Indies Sound’ is big in Eng-
land now and may hit U.S. later
this year Led Zepplin has
received another gold record, this
one for “Led Zepplin HL.”
