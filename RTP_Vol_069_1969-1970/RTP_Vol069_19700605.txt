390 Enter
Next Fall

Largest Class In History

Greater Diversity
Noted By Farrar

A record freshman class of 390
men will enter Washington and Lee
University in September, with one-
quarter of the class sharing in more
than $200,000 in financial aid, also
a record figure.

The number of applications for
admission was up eight per cent, to
1,250, from a year ago, according
to James O. Farrar, director of ad-
missions,

The university offered admissions
to 756 of the applicants, he said.
More than half—52 per cent —- ac-
cepted the offer, up from 47 per
cent last year.

In 1969, Washington and Lee en-
rolled 364 freshmen from a field of
770 who had been offered admis-
sion. This year, the university was
able to be more selective, offering
admission to a smaller number from
a larger group of applicants, with a
larger proportion of offers being ac-
cepted than a year ago, Farrar said.

Altogether, Washington and Lee
will provide $200,380 to freshmen
next year through a wide range of
scholarship, direct grant, work-study,
loan, and combination programs, ac-
cording to Dean John Mehl, direc-
tor of financial aid programs.

More than three-quarters of that
total, $150,935, will be in the form
of direct university grants. Federal
Office of Economic Opportunity
grants will total $12,700, he said.

Freshmen will receive more than
$32,000 in loans next year, $18,635
in federally sponsored National De-
fense Student Loans and $13,385 in
university loans, Dean Mehl said.

Of the 390 members of the fresh-
man class next fall, 101 will receive
financial assistance under one or
more of the programs, he said.

The entering class will include 17
Negroes, Farrar said. Altogether, 42
applications were submitted by
black students, and 29 were offered
admission, he said. All 17 will need
financial assistance and will partici-
pate fully in the various aid pro-
grams.

Applications were received from
40 states, the District of Columbia
and a number of foreign countries,
Farrar said. More than 20 per cent
of the students who applied were
from Virginia, 284 of the total
1,250. Large numbers of applica-
tions were also received from Mary-
land (126), Pennsylvania (90), New
Jersey (88), New York (76), Texas
(48), Florida (46), and North Caro-
line (44),

Dean Farrar said he was pleased
with the admissions picture. The
eight per cent increase in the num-
ber of applications received and the
five per cent increase in the number
of students who accepted offers of
admissions are “very healthy signs,’
he said,

The cost associated with a private
college as opposed to public college
have generated concern for the fu-
ture of the small, independent in
stitution, he said.

“The figures on next fall's enter-
ing class suggest that Washington
and Lee is meeting those challenges
with remarkable success,” he com-
mented.

Included in the 1970 freshman
class will be 47 sons of alumni, Far
rar said, the largest number since
1967 when 50 sons of alumni en
rolled,

Eleven Rockbridge County area
students are included in the 1970
entering class and will live at home
Freshman dormitory rooms will be
provided for 360 of the 379 resi
dent students, and the remaining
freshmen will be accommodated in
other housing

Dean Farrar said it has been cts
tomary for a small number of pro
spective freshmen to change their
minds about attending WAL during
the summer before they enter col
lege originally accepting offers of
admission. In recent years, that
number has generally been between

2 and 15,

If that were to occur again this
year, fewer freshmen would have to
be housed apart from the freshman
dormitories, Farrar said

The 17 Negroes who plan to en
rol at WAL this fall represent the
latgest group of blacks admitted to
the university in any single year

316 Men Are Graduated Today;

3 Receive Honorary Degrees

Three hundred and sixteen stu-
dents, together with three honorary
graduates, received degrees today
during the University Commence-
ment exercises on the front lawn of
the campus.

Anthony M. Coyne of Decatur,
Ga., one of two undergraduates to
receive two degrees, delivered the
valedictory. In keeping with tradi-
tion remarks were delivered by Uni-
versity President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley, rather than by an outside speak-
er.
The Commencement _ exercises
were preceded by yesterday's Bac-
culaureate Service in Evans Hall, by
the alumni luncheon in honor of the
graduates and their families, and
by last night’s presidential reception.

Earlier this morning, Brig. Gen.
Herbert J. McChrystal Jr. presented
commissions as secoind lieutenants
to 44 graduates of the University’s
ROTC program. McChrystal’s son,
Scott, was one of those commission-

ed during the ceremony in Lee
Chapel.
This morning’s graduation was

conducted with the traditional cap
and gown attire ruled optional. Presi-
dent Robert E, R. Huntley, acting
on a recommendation from the fac-
ulty executive commfittee and a stu-
dent petition signed by more than
half of the Class of 1970, announc-
ed that those who wished to wear

To Head Up Fmancial Aid, Orientation

Two recent graduates of Washing-
ton and Lee will hold important
positions in the University’s admini-
stration next year. William A.
Noell, Jr., a Washington D.C. attor-
ney, will become director of student
financial aid and assistant dean of
students beginning Sept. 1. William
McC, Schildt, a member of the ad-
ministration since 1968, will become
associate dean of students and co-
ordinator of the freshman year al
WAL. His appointment takes effect
July 1.

As director of financial aid, Noell
will supervise and administer the
various scholarship, grant, work-
study and loan programs at the uni-
versity, which this year have distri-
buted more than $500,000 among
students who could not otherwise
attend Washington and Lee.

Noell is a 1964 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee and earned his law
degree from the University of Vir-
ginia in 1969, While an undergradu-
ate at WAL, he was President of the
Student Body, and an outstanding
intercollegiate debater. He was
elected to membership in Phi Beta
Kappa and in Omicron Delta Kap-
pa, national leadership society.

Following his graduation, Noell
studied for a year in Germany un-
der a Fulbright Scholarship.

As a law student at the Univer
sity of Virginia, Noell was a mem
ber of the editorial board for the
Law Review and served on the
Moot Court Board. He was also a
member of the Quadrangular Moot
Court Team, which included law stu
dents from Yale and Columbia Uni-
versities and the University of Penn
sylvania, as well as Virginia.

He took a year from his law stu
dies to return to WAL as acting di
rector of student financial aid in the
1967-68 academic year. Since 1969
he has been associated with the law
firm of Kirland, Ellis, Hodson, Chaf
fetz. Masters and Rowe in Washing
ton.

“Washington and Lee is indeed
fortunate that Bill Noell has agreed
to return as director of financial

aid.” Lewis G. John, dean of stu
denis, said in announcing the ap
pointment

“In his earlier service as a mem
ber of the university administration
he demonstrated unusual insight and

capability. We are extremely pleased
he will be working with us again.”

Schildt, 27, was also a member of
the Class of 1964 at Washington
and Lee, graduating with a bachelor
of arts degree in economics. He
earned the bachelor of laws degree,
summa cum laude, in 1968 at W&L.
Like Noell, Schildi is a member of
both Phi Beta Kappa and ODK.

He was named an instructor in
the School of Law in February,
1968, and in September of that year
he was appointed assistant director
of admissions and assistant dean of
students.

In his newly created freshman co-
ordination post, Schildt will have
primary responsibility for planning
and administering programs for en-
tering students. Among his new
duties will be supervision of fresh-
man orientation and the faculty ad-
viser system, as well as coordination
of the upperclass counselor pro
gram in the freshmen dormitories.

In announcing the appointment,
President Robert E. R. Huntley
said: “The capabilities Bill Schildt
has demonstrated as assistant dean
of students and assistant director of
admissions convinced me he is ex-
ceptionally qualified to take on these
exiremely important new duties.

“The continual availability of 4
single member of the administration
will be of enormous benefit, 1 be
lieve, to entering students who will
be facing the complex and difficul:
transition from high school to col-
lege life,” President Huntley said.

William and Mary and of the Uni-
versity of Virginia and has received
honorary degrees from Roanoke,
Elon College, and William and
Mary.

He was a member of the Virginia
House of Delegates from 1948 to
1952 and of the State Senate from
1952 until 1960. He was elected
lieutenant governor in 1961 and
governor in 1965,

Judge Hoffman, a graduate of
Washington and Lee’s School of
Law, also received an honorary
doctor of laws degree. He has serv-
ed as Chief Judge of the U.S. Dis-
trict court’s eastern Virginia division
since 1961 and is a member of sev-
eral legal study commissions, in-
cluding the Judicial Conference of
the United States, the national com-
mittee on the Administration of the
Probation System and the Federal
Juidical Center's state-federal _re-
lations committee.

nedy named Judge Hoffman to a
committee to study the problems of
indigent defendants. He also served
on the United States Supreme Court
advisory commission on criminal
rules, He was also a delegate to two
national Republican conventions.

Dr. Pogue, executive director of
the George C. Marshall Research
Foundation and director of the
George C. Marshall Library on the
VMI campus, received the honorary

Page 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

REVIEW and OUTLOOK From Two Presidents To The Freshmen

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Friday, June 5, 1970

To The Entering Freshmen...

This newspaper comes to you as another piece of printed
matter from Washington and Lee University, your home for
the next four years. We imagine that The Ring-tum Phi,
along with other pieces of paper which you are receiving over
the summer, will make that college you’re going to attend in
September all the more mysterious.

Not that this newspaper along with dozens of other print-
ed materials does not answer most of the questions you might
have. For instance, you should be well aware of W&L’s new
curriculum which goes into effect next year. No doubt you've
been informed of the new Freshman Orientation scheduled
on campus next year. Not that it matters to you, but you will
be the first incoming freshmen in quite a while who don’t have
the dubious distinction spending three days and two nights
at Natural Bridge under the old Freshman Camp system of
orientation, now restructured into Freshman Orientation on
campus.

You should be receiving an Interfraternity Council Rush-
book in a few weeks as well. It will explain the new deferred
rush system which will go into effect this fall. As a member of
the Class of 1974, you will be the first students to participate
in a seven week deferred rush system rather than the tradi-
tional one week’s rush which W&L had in the past.

You have received or will receive information on practic-
ally every aspect of life here in the Washington and Lee com-
munity. Yet no scrap of paper can convey to you the solution
to the mystery of what it’s like to be a member of the Wash-
ingtn and Lee community. And we do not pretend we can
either.

We can tell you that W&L has a sense of tradition. Not
static but evolutionary tradition. The changes mentioned
above were the result of a careful study by students, faculty
and administration of their own community of how W&L
should evolve out of old traditions into newer ones.

We can tell you that conventional dress, consisting of a
coat and tie, is worn less and less on campus. But the essence
of what is termed a “Washington and Lee gentleman” is not
any less present, even though its traditional mark may be dis-
appearing. Students still recognize the honor system which
sets a basic code to live by: a W&L gentleman does not lie,
cheat or steal.

We can tell you that as a whole the student body has be-
come more vocal in expressing its views on issues within and
without the campus. A large majority of W&L students voted
in a referendum last May to petition the faculty to suspend
classes so that national issues could be studied here on camp-
us, with the provision that those who wanted to attend class
could arrange it with their professors. The students respon-
sibiliy accepted the faculty’s decision not to cancel any classes
but to provide other outlets for those who wanted to become
involved in a study of national affairs. They did not destroy
property or threaten the lives of others. In short, they acted
as responsible members of the W&L community.

W&L is changing; it is growing; yet it is retaining its sense
of tradition. You will become a part of this change, this
growth, this sense of tradition. Washington and Lee offers
you nothing more than a challenge to an education—and a
way of life. It remains your responsibility to take up that
challenge.

During your four years here you will be a part of Wash-
ington and Lee’s community. It will be your community, your
education, your way of life. And when you leave in June of
1974, see if you don’t pause during the graduation ceremony,
look up at the colonnade, and finally realize what it really
means to be a Washington and Lee gentleman.

L. L. Me.

By Robert E. R. Huntley
President, Washington and Lee
Last year, my message to new stu-

dents declared my belief that rarely
had students enjoyed the opportun-
ity to enter college during a time of
such extraordinary intellectual ex-
citement and ferment. When a mem-
ber of my staff read this statement,
he said something to the effect of
“Boy, you can say that aagin!”

So, I think I shall.

Yours will be the first class to be-
gin under the new curriculum and
the new calendar, this in itself a
matter of great excitement and anti-
cipation for you, current students,
and the faculty. The hard work of
translating the broad design of the
new curriculum into a workable,
necessary structure of courses and
degree programs has been complet-
ed; now you and your classmates
will have the opportunity to go at
your college educations with a free-
dom and flexibility unprecedented
at Washington and Lee. It is an op-
portunity filled with hope and ex-
pectations of all concerned.

You have the right to expect that
Washington and Lee will help pro-
vide you with an experience — aca-

Calyx Presents Editions
To Recognize Service:

Colvin Chosen Dedicatee

Members of the staff of Washing-
ton and Lee’s yearbook, the Calyx,
have presented engraved copies of
the book to two members of the
University Committee in recognition
of service to Washington and Lee.

Miss Margaret Cullipher, the re-
ference librarian for the McCormick
Library received one issue for
“helping all students with reference
works and theses and sharing her
full knowledge of the archives.”

Dr. L. K. Johnson, Professor of
Commerce. received the other copy
for his great interest, throughout
the years, in his students and parti-
cularly the Calyx.

This year’s Calyx was dedicated
to Prof. Milton Colvin of the De-
partment of Politics in the School
of Commerce, Economics and Poli-
tics, and a candidate for the Demo-
cratic nomination for the Senate
seat now held by Harry F. Byrd Jr.

In the dedication, Colvin was
praised not only as an excellent pro-
fessor” but also as all man with “a
refreshing approach to education, an
enthusiasm fol life in general and
for people in particular.”

Freshman Camp

Washington and Lee's traditional
Freshman Camp, which has been
held at Natural Bridge for the past
38 years will be converted to an
on-campus orientation program be-
ginning this fall.

The decision was reached earlier
this year by the Student Affairs
Committee, which had been given
authority by the faculty as a whole.

Lewis G. John, dean of students,
said the decision came out of the
group's investigation of the camp
and was primarily influenced by two
factors.

First, he said, the new changes in
the curriculum scheduled for the up-
coming year, necessitated the intro-
duction of a more academically
oriented program compared to the
relatively basic outline of freshman
requirements that had been a part of
previous camp sessions.

Second, the newly instigated de-
ferred rush program will negate an
underlying purpose of the Natural
Bridge site-that is, the effort to re-
move freshmen from a hectic pre-
rush atmosphere.

John also said he feels that fresh-

demic and otherwise — that will
prove useful, perhaps even invalu-
able to you, now and in the future.
It may even be, in the jargon of the
moment, “relevant” and “meaning-
ful,” but above all, it should be an
experience that we can agree is
worth your time and best efforts, as
well as ours. You may be certain
that your professors and deans will
strive to meet the valid expectations
demanded of them by you, by them-
selves, and by the University in its
broadest compass.

Washington and Lee would, in
turn, expect certain things of you.
Foremost, perhaps, is the expecta-
tion that you will not treat lightly
the opportunity that is yours in the
coming year and those that follow.

Particularly we hope and expect
that you will approach your role as
a citizen of this campus and this
community with a deep sense of re-
sponsibility. You will find that your
views and your individuality are
respected here; such respect must be
mutual and tempered with toler-
ance and self-discipline if the educa-
tional strength of Washington and
Lee is to have meaning for you and
your fellow students.

Turner Chosen

Academy Head

Edward F. Turner Jr., professor
of physics and head of the depart-
ment at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, has been chosen president-
elect of the Virginia Academy of
Science.

Dr. Turner's election came at the
association’s 48th annual meeting in
Richmond last week.

As president-elect of the VAS, he
will succeed Maurice B. Rowe, com-
missioner of the state Department
of Agriculture and Commerce, when
Mr. Rowe's term expires next spring.

A member of the faculty at W&L
since 1957, Dr. Turner received his
Ph.D. from the University of Vir-
ginia, after earning his master’s de-
gree from the Massachusetts Instit-
ute of Technology and two bache-
lor's degrees from Washington and
Lee.

In 1969, he completed a detailed
study of the impact of modern tech-
nology on small-college libraries,
under a grant from the federal De-
partment of Health, Education and
Welfare.

men should become more familiar
with the Lexington campus and its
geography while undergoing their
orientation.

The increase in academic orienta-
tion, spurred on by vast new curri-
culum changes within the Univer-
sity, appears to be a certainty.

Subcommittees of the SAC have
studied possibilities for next fall's
orientation throughout the second
semester. A major part of this re-
search has been an investigation of
orientation at eleven other colleges.

The replies from the schools—

Princeton, Haverford, Williams,
Amherst, Dartmouth, Bowdoin,
Virginia, The University of the

South, Davidson, Lafayette, and Le-
high have been analyzed in an ef-
fort to find parts of these programs
that might prove useful next fall.

John said some of the schools
have shown surprise that Washing-
ton and Lee is abandoning its tradi-
tional approach to orientation,

Student Body President
To the class of 1974:

In three months you will be com-
ing to Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. What should you expect from
the school? What does it expect
from you? Perhaps neither of these
questions should be asked, You are
not just coming here, but you are
becoming a part of the university.
Your expectations may be those you
seek as an individual. But there will
be new problems, new questions
posed. The search for answers to
these questions is the essence of
education, personal and social as
well as educational.

Washington and Lee is in a great
transition. A transition that is not
unlike the one of a hundred years
ago when R. E. Lee brought Wash-
ington College around to face the
new problems of a new country, In
some ways we will all be freshmen
next year, in an enviable position to
find new beliefs as well as reaffirm
valuable old ones. I am_ excited
about the immediate future of this
school, the years which your class
will play a great role.

We have not been untouched by
the upheavals in American educa-
tion. Many of the concepts of that
education are being challenged.
Washington and Lee has been re-
sponding well to that challenge,
with an awareness of its uniqueness
as a university. This school is in-
creasingly representative of the di-
versity of contemporary America.
A new curriculum and new activities
will continue to stress the impor-
tance of individual initiative and

responsibility. The university has
recognized its need for a real con-
cern for the welfare of the com-
munity and the nation. These, coup-
led with involvement in and becom-
ing a part of the Honor System and
its cohesive spirit, present us as in-
dividuals with a great challenge.

The university experience will be
unlike any other you have had. It
will demand thought, reflection,
considerations, and concern. It will
demand action and _ involvement.
That experience is not passive, As
students we must ask many ques-
tions. What is education? What is
the university and my role in it?
What are my responsibilities to my
self, my family, my school, my na-
tion, my world? What must [I do?
These are hard questions. This is
not, I think, an easy time. But
Washington and Lee has always pro-
vided a unique atmosphere of per-
sonal concern and respect. Members
of this community continue to care
in a deep way about one another.
This will help you and you must
help it by insisting that true ties go
beyond superficial differences in a
world that, I am afraid, has begun
to set apparent differences as bar-
riers to human relations. | am sure
that there is no greater value than
human bonds of mutual trust and
respect.

I hope you will start Washington
and Lee now by beginning to ask
these questions of yourself. 1 hope
you will then ask us these questions
and offer your solutions to our prob-
lems. We look forward to your be-
coming a very important part of this
university community.

Departments Planning For
Studies In Spring Term

A mini-semester in Europe next
year will be one innovative offering
as Washington and Lee University
adopts a flexible new curriculum
and academic calendar.

French, Spanish and German stu-
dents will be able to spend the six-
week “short term” in April and May
living with families in European na-
tions and participating in academic
and cultural programs, not in class-
rooms but in the foreign society it-
self.

Students going overseas will first
participate in a week-long orienta-

Moved

south of Lexington, the outings were
designed to acquaint students with
the varied aspects of college life.
Attendance was voluntary and ori-
entation was conducted in a series of
outdoor assemblies.

Freshmen lived together in small
cabin groups and each group was
led by an upperclass counselor. In-
formal intramural athletic competi-
tion was conducted and freshmen
were given the opportunity to speak
informally with members of the
University community.

Next year's Freshman Orienta-
tion, tentatively scheduled for Sep-
tember 8-10, will be under the gen-
eral supervision of William Schildt,
newly appointed coordinator of the
freshman year. Information about
the program will be circulated dur-
ing the summer.

tion program in Lexington, empha-
sizing intensive oral drills in the
language of the country they will
visit.

Once in France, Spain or Germany,
the students will participate in aca-
demic programs set up to include
local teachers as well as W&L fac-
ulty; they will visit historic and cul-
tural attractions such as theatres
and museums; they will absorb the
foreign culture more deeply and ac-
curately in the nation itself than
they might in months of classroom
study on W&L’s campus.

The cost of the program, esti-
mated to be about $900, will be
borne by the students. They will be
encouraged to remain in their for-
eign country beyond the formal con-
clusion ot the mini-semester, but
will have to plan their own pro-
grams after May.

will be possible when the new calen-
dar goes into effect.

Every department in the univer-
sity has re-vamped all its course of-
ferings because of the new calendar,
making more efficient use of two
normal 12-week semesters, the first
from September to December and
the second from January to April.
Each department has also taken full
advantage of the possibilities grow-
ing out of the short mini-semester,
by designing programs that are thor-
oughly new in concept and educa-
tionally invaluable,

, ll Hi, i uv

By Betty Munger
Manager of the W&L Bookstore

The recent—and continuing—de-
bate on the purposes and fitting func-
tions of the University applies to the
Bookstore as well as to the faculty,
administration, students and Alum-
ni. Just because the Bookstore is
located in one of the main thoro-
fares of the campus doesn’t mean
that we see ourselves as a passage-
way through college.

The Bookstore is owned and oper-
ated by the University on a non-pro-
fit basis. (In fact, we lose a little
money each year.) It’s basic purpose
is exposure to books—non-required
books. Practically all of the book
stock is paperback books on a wide
variety of subjects: Philosophy, best-
sellers, environment and survival,
art and even a bit of “pornography”
if there is any such thing these days.
There are books for parallel reading,
for term papers and for the explora-
tion of subjects which have attracted
the student’s enthusiasm in class.

About The Bookstore

And, very important, books for
sheer pleasure!

Each year there are “happenings”
such as Dabney Stuart’s reading of
his own poetry to an overflowing
crowd with cider and doughnuts
afterwards. Mr. Dan Walker, chair-
man of the Violence Commission
Committee which reported on the
Chicago riots, visited with students
over coffee one afternoon in April.
And there are times when the store
looks like some bright bargain base-
ment as surplus stock is put on sale
by the pound on a set of country
scales.

But the Bookstore is—if we do
our job well—more than that. It is a
place of ideas, discussion and laugh-
ter. The pressure is off here—and it
is a center for serious argument and
trivial talk. During the tumultuous
days of May the store seethed with
people, petitions and posters, and
persuasive politicking. This is as it
should be. Only unkindness is bar-
red.

Ju Painting ae For Expo ‘70

Professor I-Hsuing Ju, Washington
and Lee’s artist-in-residence, has re-
cently received word that one of his
paintings has been selected to be
shown in Japan’s Tokyo Expo 1970.
The work, done on a cold January
Saturday in Ju’s studio in Howe an-
nex, will be featured along with 99
other works in the Tenth Annual
Nanga-in Showing, “southern,” or
free-style of the Japanese Art As-
sociation,

The painting itself is 10 feet wide
by six feet high, and has also been
shown at the Tokyo National Mus-
eum, the Kyoto National Museum,
and the Osaka Museum. Even be-
fore the Toyko Expo, a thousand
postcard reproductions of the paint-
ings have been sold to visitors from
all over.

Earlier this year, a selection of
Professor Ju’s works was shown in
the University Bookstore. This show-
ing consisted of works which he had
done while here at Washington and
Lee, primarily of campus buildings
and winter scenes. Later in the year,
he held another showing of his
works in the gallery in duPont Hall,
in which a greater emphasis was
placed on his works in an Oriental
style.

About W&L Athletics...

By Gene Corrigan
Director of Athletics

The Washington and Lee athletic
program is geared for maximum par-
ticipation of the student body, and
we take this opportunity to advise
you of the program and let you
know that you are welcome to try
out for any of our teams.

Just to give you some ‘background,
during this past year, over 340 stu-
dents participated in the intercollegi-
ate athletic program, taking part in
12 different sports. It might be wor-
thy of your attention that the teams
won 64% of their games.

We are presently in the midst of
construction of a 2.5 million dollar
gymnasium addition which will cer-
tainly be something to look forward
to.

We feel that our athletic program
is a very fine one and one of the rea-
sons are the people involved. Many
of you have already been contacted
by our coaches but to those of you
who have not, I list our staff and
hope that you will contact them
over the summer if you're interested
in participating.

&L Gets Three All-Americans

Bill Brumback has once again
started things shaking, only this time
it isn't Doremus Gym but Wilson
Field. Brumback, a rising senior,
was selected for the First Team AIll-
American in lacrosse. He had a
little help this time, for Whit Mor-
rill and Ned Coslett also achieved
All-American status in third team
slots.

Brumback is the first W&L stu-

. .
dent to be All-American in two ‘n

spots. He shares this distinction with
very few people—people like O. J.
Simpson and Jim Brown, Of course
Brumback would have had a much
harder time had he not been sup-
ported by an extremely strong team.

Coming off last year’s frustrating |

1-8 season, prospects appeared dim
for the 1970 lacrosse team. There
remained a nucleus of the able up-
perclassmen from the year before,
and there was a large group of
freshmen on hand, but no one was
predicting much more than a so-so
season for the Generals.

were encouraging, but were not at
all indicative of the coming season.
In the opener W&L coasted by a
shoddy Geneseo State team, 9-2,
but days later fell to a surprisingly
strong Towson State team by 10-7.

So the Generals left for Pennsyl-
vania, They had but a 1-1 record, yet

despite the disappointing loss to
Towson, there had been encourag-
ing play. Senior attackman Tom
Groton had started with a bang,
scoring four against Geneseo, and
adding a fifth against Towson. Be-
fore the season’s end, Groton would
smash over 25 goals.

The first midfield of junior Whit
Morrill and freshmen Sam Engle-
hart and Chip Tompkins had also
looked good. Englehart joined Gro-
ton on the crease in an offensive for-
mation known as 2-2-2. His out-
standing total of 35 goals added to
Groton’s 25-plus, would give W&L
over 60 points from the crease alone
for the season.

Sophomore attackman Scott Neese
had five points against Geneseo and
kept his scoring total high all sea-
son. His total of 39 points by sea-
son’s end was the high for the team.
Scott was a First Team All-Confer-
ence selection and will co-captain
the team next year.

On the midfield the scoring sen-
sation was Englehart. Senior co-
captain Jay Meriwether, Chip Tomp-
kins, and Ed Tognetti all did well in
faceoffs. Tompkins also led the team
in ground balls, thus securing the
famed McHenry Trophy. Captain-
elect Whit Morrill was second in

the Jay Stull Trophy for selflessness,
and Junior Bob Jantzen, in only
the second year of lacrosse.

On the third midfield were Mark
Skoggard and freshmen Ed Tognetti
and Tim Winfield, both of whom
showed tremendous potential. Coach
Szlasa ran all three midfields with
regularity, and herein was one of the
strengths of the team. Senior John
Thomas was expected to play on
one of the first two midfields, but
was unfortunately injured early in
the season,

The team suffered through a tedi-
ous northern trip, characterized by
lots of snow, and long bus rides
with the Jarred Mole Man. At the
end of the trip was a game with Vil-
lanova, and for three quarters the
score stood even. But as the previ-
ous paragraphs have pointed out,
there was quite a bit of offensive
talent on the squad and the team ex-
ploded in the fourth quarter, and
won hands down, 10-6. Englehart’s
five goals and Groton’s four spark-
ed the big win.

With this important game under
their belts, the Generals took off on
a six game winning streak. At this
point the unsung heroes of the team
should be mentioned—the defense.
The goalie is at the heart of the de-
fense, and goalie Bill Ingersoll had
a fine year, earning second team All
Conference honors. Especially note-
worthy was his outstanding effort in
the biggest win of the season—the
10-4 upset of Washington College.

All-American and co-captain Ned
Coslett also had a fine year. His
leadership was respected by the
team, who awarded him the Martin
Trophy for that trait—leadership.
Playing behind were junior Bill
Brumback and sophomore Tom

Smith. These two ran into some
spectacular attackmen during the
year—Maloney of Towson, Peter-
son and Seipe of Carolina, George
of Washington, Duquette and Gan-
non of Virginia—and did a fine job
on all of them.

Sophomore John Lamour and
freshmen Don Eaverson and John
Rogers all did excellent work when
called upon, especially in man-down
situations.

Another valuable asset to the
team was its strong bench. “Lucky
Chucky” Robson, “Ace” Graham,
Matt “2-2-2 on-the-crease” LaMotte,
“The Bookends”—John and Chappy
Conrad, “Beets” McLaughlin, Pete
Saunders, Tonnie Brown, “Cliffdwel-
ler” Radcliffe, and “Panel Truck”
Salmons. These players provided the
depth and flexibility necessary for a
winning team.

As the wins began piling up—8-5
over Duke, 10-7 over Baltimore, 20-
5 over Roanoke, 10-4 over Wash-
ington, 15-3 over Loyola—W&L re-
ceived a measure of national recog-
nition. Going into the game against
Carolina, W&L was ranked number
11 in the nation, Carolina was rank-
ed number 7, however, and the
game between the two was the finest
seen here in many years. Before a
large and enthusiastic crowd, W&L
came back from a 6-1 halftime de-
ficit to lead by 7-6, only to lose 8-7.

Following this heartbreaking loss,
WAL coasted by UMBC 12-6, then
faced national powerhouse Virginia.
Virginia was ranked number three,
but W&L was ranked number 19---
a far, far cry from the 1-8 record
the year before. Unfortunately Vir-
ginia was simply the better team,
and W&L fell by the disheartening
score of 19-3,

the number of applications this year
resulted partly from intense recruit-

The university's ability to offer
substantial financial aid to students

W&L was another major factor in
the increase, Farrar said.
