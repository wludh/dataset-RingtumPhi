Law School
Sends Squad

To Tourney

Gantry University, a fictitious col-
lege that expelled students for con-
ducting a demonstration, will be a
center of attention for four Wash-
ington and Lee University students
in national competition next week.

A moot court team from W&L’s
School of Law will participate in
the National Moot Court Competi-
tion in New York, Dec. 15-17.

The Washington and Lee team
earned the right to be in the na-
tional meet by winning a four-state
regional meet in which law schools
of nine colleges and universities par-
ticipated last month in Norfolk. It
marked the third time in the last
four years that Washington and Lee
has won the regional meet.

rhis year’s moot question centers
around the problem of student un-
rest in colleges. W&L’s team has
prepared a brief arguing that Gantry
U. was not on solid legal ground in
expelling the students for conduct
ing a peaceful demonstration.

Washington and Lee’s first op-
ponent will be the University of
Indiana. Twenty-six colleges will

compete.

Each competing team prepares a
brief on one side of a debatable
legal question. Team members must
also be prepared to argue either
side of the case when they are in
moot court competition

Washington and Lee’s team ts
captained by Beverly C. Reed of
Lexington. The others debating the
question will be H. William Walker,
Ir. of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Robin

P. Hartmann of Virginia Beach
Charles C. Lewis of Martinsville,

Student Body Endorses
Independent Examination

A giant step was taken Wednes-

day in the direction of an inde-
pendent exam schedule when the
students took part in a referendum
to determine their views. An over-
whelming majority of students voted
in favor of the proposals of the
Curriculum Committee.

In the rain of Wednesday 829
students voted at the polling places
around the campus. The first ques-
tion on the ballot was “Do you feel
that an Independent Examination
Schedule would pose an unwarrant-
ed burden on the Honor System?”
Eighty-two students voted in the af-
firmative on this question and 743
students voted in the negative. The
second question was “Do you favot
the establishment of a system where-
by a student has the option of
scheduling his own examinations?”
On this question 794 students voted
in the affirmative and 35 students

Kuhn, W&L’'s double-threat quar-
terback, led the conference in total
offense with 1,107 yards gained, the
majority of it in passing. Kuhn com
pleted 71 of 163 passes for 924
yards and ran for an additional 183
yards.

Gardner, Washington's sensational
freshman tailback, accumulated 842
yards in rushing, an average of 93.6
yards a game and just over five yards
a carry

Kuhn edged champion Centre's
top-notch quarterback, Paul Eth-
ridge, in passing and total offense.
Ethridge’s total bag was 918 yards,
all but nine of them in the air.

WAL flanker Bruce Green nipped
Sewanee’s Keith Bell to win scoring
honors. Green caught eight touch
down passes for 48 points, while
Bell accumulated 46 points on seven
touchdowns and four extra points

Washington's Kerry Drulis was
the top pass receiver with 37 grabs

College Confidential:
An A ppraisal

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi reacted to the profile of
W&L appearing in a college handbook in a manner we
heard voiced often here when the article became public.
Quoting Lawrence Handel’s characterization of the Wash-
ington and Lee student as having displaced intellectual
curiosity with the gentlemanly ideal, the Tuesday edition
called this conclusion ‘‘absurd.’’ We are not so sure.

There is an admitted problem involved in anyone making
such value judgments about a school. The basis for such
an evaluation is ultimately subjective, and we doubt we could
pronounce in such a public way about America’s colleges. Mr.
Handel obviously feels he can.

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi cites several reasons why the
profile in College Confidential is absurd, but all these seem
to center around the changes that have occurred here re-
cently, explicitly the exchange program. It further called
for a large student turnout in the exam referendum to prove
once again that students are intellectually curious. We ques-
tion whether the vote on such an issue, which is essentially
self-preservative, or the faculty’s approval of an exchange
program can be linked in such a certain manner to intellectual
curiosity.

We will agree that Mr. Handel probably gathered his
material prior to the curriculum changes made last year, and
so the force of his conclusion is somewhat mitigated.

Nonetheless, he is still substantially correct. For whatever
reason, school is still basically an interruption for too many
W&L students, a burden which they have to bear on the way
to acquiring a diploma, their union card to the professions.
Some of these students are very diligent, noting a correlation
between good grades and quality graduate school acceptances,
and between the latter and lots of money, but hard work is
not per se evidence of intellectual curiosity.

We do believe that if Mr. Handel were to re-examine
W&L this year he would be forced to admit that circum-
stances, especially over the past two years, are changing for
the better. It may even be said that in the last four years
the emphasis has shifted from one overwhelmingly that de-
scribed in College Confidential to one perhaps slightly in
favor of the norm he advocates. At any rate, that is the
direction in which the University is moving, and we feel
the new curriculum, calendar and exchange program (and
hopefully coeducation) will accelerate the process. Much still
needs to be done.

There are many who would question our qualified opti-
mism, and perhaps they are right.

Finally, whether one agrees with the evaluation com-
pletely, accepts it with qualifications, as we do, or dismisses
it entirely, one must still realize that many prospective stu-
dents are going to reject W&L because of the conclusions
Mr. Handel reaches. It is therefore incumbent upon all those
concerned with education here to weigh carefully the decis-
ions that are facing the University and consider the issues
it ought to be confronting with the consciousness that both
the fact and the image of intellectual lethargy must be re-
moved as quickly and effectively as possible.

A Basic Student Right

The Interfraternity Council has, by asking to be allowed
a representative at faculty meetings, implicitly posed a much
broader problem.

Traditionally, faculty meetings have been closed affairs
at nearly every University in the country. Many have aban-
doned this practice, but it still persists ac W&L.

We think the students have a basic right to have at faculty
meetings at least one representative who can communicate
to the student body the business transacted in a more
thorough and knowledgeable manner than is presently pos-
sible. It is after all, the —_ s business, too, that is trans-
acted there. The faculty ought, of course, to have the pre-
rogative of closed sessions much as the _— Committee
of the Student Body now does, but we think this should be
the rarest of exceptions to the rule.

If a representative were admitted, students would not
only be aware of the outcome of issues, but also of their initial
reception, arguments for and against and the relative strength
of the prevailing sentiment. The most immediate results would
be that students could more intelligently formulate their own
proposals, and think and work with the faculty on matters
of mutual concern, instead of in the isolation that now
prevails,

The only argument we have heard advanced against
implementation of such a practice, although there are prob-
ably others, is that professors fear unpopular Views might
have adverse effects in the classroom. We doubt that fear
would materialize. Ir does seem to us at any rate that the
potential danger is certainly less than that taken by an EC
member, OF any student expressing an opinion in the Ring-
tum Phi. The faculty seems to have always acted with re
straint when differences of opinion were involved, and we
see no reason for the faculty to imagine students would not
act with similar good judgment.

On Grappling With A Tragedy

By Kirk Woodward

The Troubadour Theater chal-
lenges itself with every production.
and next Tuesday through Friday it
presents a play which everybody
knows is a challenge. King Lear is
allegedly the pinnacle of tragic
drama. Bernard Shaw. for example.
says that “No one will ever write
a better tragedy than King Lear.”
Is he right? If he is, can the play be
produced successfully?

Some answers to these question
will emerge when the play is pre-
sented next week: we have been
working on them for a month and a
half. Without claiming to know
what the performances will tell us.
we are able to identify some of the
problems the play presents. You
will be able to judge results for
yourself,

The first problem of the play is
that its reputation gets in its way.
“Tragedy has a good press. The
catharsis that tragedy is supposed to
provide is certified a Good Thing.
so the audience sits and waits to
feel a catharsis. The newspapers ask
why no one writes tragedy any morc
and assume that people should

This expectation affects casts as
well as audiences. Aciors try to be-
come tragically sublime. They take
on hollow-sounding voices—prefer-
ably British accented: they look to
the heavens often. or to the second
balcony (at the Troubadour, if it
happened, we would have to say that

they look at the plumbing. Come
and see)
If the hollow rhetorical style

doesn't appeal. a director is likely
as noi to try for a strong effect by
imposing what Eric Bentley calls
Bright Idea: Othello in art nouveau
decor, Macheth as a Christ figure.
Hamlet on a trapeze—anything to
jack up the audience's feelings
These examples may sound far
fetched, but each year Shakespeare
productions get madder and madder
(A Henry ¥ in New York this year
seemed to take place on a sort of

playground.) The antidote to this
vagueness is to try and make sense
out of the play. In King Lear, what
is it in Edmund that makes every-
body trust him? Are Lear's knights
really riotous? What kind of a father
was Gloucester?

As Bentley says, the director who
approaches Shakespeare this way
finds himself a pioneer. King Lear,
when approached this way, emerges
as an extraordinarily well put to-
gether piece of drama, with details
thoroughly prepared for in advance
and with even the most apparently
diffuse sections—the Fool's conver-
sation and the mad scenes—tight
and economical.

On the other hand, Lear presents
a mumber of serious difficulties. It
might be expected that the title role
is one of them, and it is: still, Lear
is seldom forced to hold the stage
himself and he shares the weight of

his part with Edgar and the Fool in
some of the scenes.

An even bigger problem is that
the play is long and fairly sprawling.
It has an enormous weight. A cast
has to concentrate hard to maintain
tension through the length of the
play and present meaning as well.
We cut the play some. Still, keep-
ing it moving depends mainly on
mindbending work from the cast.

Another difficulty is built into any
United States production of Shake-
speare. Our language habits are
sloppy. Hamlet's soliloquy is likely
to begin, “Tuh be or not tuh be.”
Blank verse speaking demands pre-
ciseness and variety, as well as the
ability to act. What's more, our
culture teaches little boys not to ery
and men to keep their voices down,
so a line like “World, world, o
world” is hard to say without self-
consciousness.

am terribly proud that the Trou
hae are doing King Lear, no!
only because the play is such a land
mark in drama but because it strikes
me as an image of life that we need
with us all the time. Every audience
sides with Lear, Cordelia, Edgar and

Kent against Goneril and Regan,
but the first four are mad—in real
madness, in their love, and in their

final faith in forgiveness—and the
last two are rational, even intellect-
ual, and correct in everything they
say about Lear, the foolish old man

Can you imagine forgiveness as
a national policy? At this moment

W&L Students Aren’t ‘In Love’

Could it be that the supporters of
coeducation at Washington and Lee
University have found an irresistible
argument?

Namely. WAL students are not
falling in love enough. To be pre-
cise, they are falling in love ai 11.2
percentage points below the national
level for four-year colleges.

And who is bold enough to op-
pose love?

The figures are those of the
American Council on Education.
which has been conduciing for some
years extensive surveys on campuses
to define the environment and to
determine what shapes it. Freshmen
fill out detailed questionnaires on
their habits and preferences, and

opinions about the college environ-
ment in some 33 categories. The
data was released by the Council
this month.

Those reporting, “I fell in love,”
amounted to 14.6 per cenit of the
respondents. Nationally, 25.8 per
cent of students responding from
four-year colleges reported they had
fallen in love.

Interpreting the significance of
this data, Council researchers said
colleges with high scores in this
category tend to be places where
students engage in dating of “an
informal or casual type (coke. coffee.
or study dates)” and that colleges
with low scores are those where
students frequently complain about
not having enough dates. Colleges
for men, in particular, tend to fall
into the latter category, the Council
said.

The American Council on Educa-
fon survey had some favorable
things to report about Washington
and Lee's classroom atmosphere

Only 4 per cent of the WAL siu
denis thought that students were
treated “more like numbers in a
book” than human beings, compared

Speaking My Mind...

 

Sports Illustrated’s Jinx

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

Somewhere in the vast domain of
Rockefeller Center, or wherever
Sports Illustrated is published,
there’s bound to be a closet full of
broken crystal balls because, man,
the big boys up there just don’t
know how to pick the winners. Now
I know that the SI kiss-of-death leg-
end has been floating around for
some time. | mean, you make the
cover of the magazine, then you go
out and lose your next game which
coincidentally ruins your whole year.
Chat’s all there is to it. Plain and

simple. But it’s getting to the point
now where they should leave the
cover blank, because one dandy jinx

has hit that fine magazine this fall.

Well, why not? They deserve it,
don't they? Back in October when
the whole country was going ban-
anas over the Mets, Sports Ilustrat-
ed held its ground, There was Frank
Robinson on the cover of the Octo-
ber 6 issue. Two weeks later the
great Brooks Robinson adorned SI's
front. Well we all know what hap-
pened! The Mets pranced their way
to victory, leaving the Orioles and
Sports Illustrated feeling the effects
of a double-whammy, Maybe S|!
still is suffering the consequences
for bucking the wild Metsomania
tide, for ever since then their cover

 

PREVENT FOREST ries tea

stories have been ominous omens
of impending disaster.
“Green Bay—The Road Back!”

It certainly seemed logical to write
this article back in early October.
The Pack was seemingly bouncing
back after a horrendous ‘68 sea-
son. But bam-crunch and it was bye-
bye Bart Starr, Today the only road
Green Bay is on is the one leading
back from Cleveland. That’s where
they suffered their sixth defeat of
the season.

And then there was the story of
the unfortunate Georgia Bulldogs.
The SEC had many fine football
teams this year, makings of a great
cover story. Bul which one was to
go on the cover? It could have been
any one of seven teams. The honor
was bestowed upon Georgia who
mysteriously changed from Bulldogs
to Hotdogs later in the season when
they discovered that you can’t win
games without a quarterback,

So on down the list. October 27
“My Story by Lew Alcindor.” What
1 great guy! All that’s happened to
the giant since then is some bad
publicity. When you play badly,
Lew, you might get booed. And if
you get booed, Lew, you don’t spit
on the floor and push some kid
down who's bugging you. I repeat

. great guy!

Nothing’s to be gained by rubb-
ing in all these chance misfortunes,
though. SI has had some good mo-
ments mixed in with the bad. Steve
Owens overcame the handicap of
being on the cover and went on his
rampaging way to the Heisman
Trophy and I don’t suppose that the
magazine has suffered any because
of its present slump. Anyway good
and bad breaks in sports have a
tendency to even out over the long
run, so SI can probably look for-
ward to a rosy future. But, my God,
for the time being—Teams! Coaches!
Players! . . . Beware!

Washington and Lee’s high-flying
Generals extended their record to
4-1 with decisive victories over
Hampden-Sydney and Lynchburg
by 86-56 and 66-49. Tomorrow the
Generals travel to Pennsylvania to
take on Lehigh.

Mel Cartwright went on a ram-
page against Hampden-Sydney, scor-
ing 25 points and grabbing a career-
high 22 rebounds. Mike Neer added
15 points and took 18 rebounds
while patrolling the boards. Mike
Daniel was third on the scoring list
with 14 points,

Cartwright shot for a 59% field

goal percentage while tallying 9
assists. Although the Generals were

only 38 for 32 from the floor, they
made up for it by amassing 70 re-
bounds,

Earlier in the week, Washington
and Lee topped Lynchburg’s Hor-
nets, 66-49,

“Lynchburg played a good, scrap-
py ball game,” explained Coach
Canfield. “We were flat, but I
didn't mind that.” The Generals’
mentor was pleased with the de-
fense. “The papers said they were
cold, but the fact was that we ap-
plied our defense better in the sec-
ond half.”

Something was applied to the
Hornets, who could only manage to
connect on 6 of their 35 last half
field goal attempts. However, a 20
point production at the foul line
kept Lynchburg in the ball game.

Mike Neer canned 21 points and
got 16 rebounds while Mike Daniel
connected for 20 points and collect
ed 8 rebounds. Stu Fauber added 11
points to the W&L effort. Mel Cart-
wright, on whom the Hornets did
an amazing “collapsing” defense
job, was held to only 4 points but
still managed 9 rebounds

Newlin Wingfield was the top

High-scoring sophomore Mike Daniel operates under the boards dur-
ing the home game against Rollins, the Generals’ second win of the

season,

Lynchburg point-maker with 15
tallies and 9 rebounds. Harold Mas-
sie contributed 10 points.

Once again the Generals outdid
their opponent in all departments.
Leading 29-17 at halftime, Washing
ton and Lee went on to out-rebound
the Hornets, 57-40, and to outshoot
them, 42% to 29%

Although Lehigh features a drab-
looking 1-3 record, Roy Heckman’s
Engineers are rated by Coach Can-
field as “one of the top four or five
teams on our schedule.” In addi-
tion, Lehigh will be making its first
home appearance of the season.

Ihe Engineers feature 6°6” 230-
pound captain Bob Fourtune, a pro
prospect who thus far leads the
team with an 18 point average
Fourtune scored 25 points against
Bucknell and added 23 in a game
with Temple
Waters and Scoit Beeten,
a pair of home-grown boys, add
luster to Lehigh’s attack. Waters
has averaged 14 points per contest
while Beeten has shot for better
than 10 points a game.

Lehigh dropped opening decisions
to Army, (74-61) and Temple (73-
70) but rebounded to top Bucknell,
75-66. Colgate defeated the Engi-
neers last Wednesday 68-57

The only previous match-up be-
tween these two schools resulted in
a Lehigh victory in 1914,

For the season, some statistics:
Mike Daniel, Mel Cartwright and
Mike Neer continue to pace the
generals offensively. Daniel leads the
team in scoring with 95 points for a
19 point-per-game average. The
sophomore has connected on 62%
of his shots. Neer has a 15.6 point-
per-game average, and leades the
Generals with 76 rebounds. Neer
has hit on 50° of his field goal at

tempts. Cartwright, with 70 re-
bounds, (14 a game) and 88 points
(17.6 a game) is second in those two
departments, but the tall senior
leads the team in field accuracy with
a 66% mark.

But defensive efforts by the likes
of Norwood Morrison, Stu Fauber
and Ellie Gutshall have had their
influencing roles. Opposing teams
are hitting only 30% of their floor
shots; in addition, the Generals have
oul-rebounded the enemy, 273 to
214. W&L’s defensive measures
have limited opponents to a total
311 points, or 62.2 a game.
