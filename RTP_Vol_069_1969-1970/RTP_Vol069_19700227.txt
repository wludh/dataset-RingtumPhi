faculties are temporarily filling the
teaching positions left vacant by
the death of Professor William W.
Chaffin last weekend.

Lee Kahn, assistant professor of
fine arts, is now teaching Public
Speaking 104. William  Schildt,
assistant dean of students, and Tom
Clark, a professor at VMI, are
teaching Public Speaking 202 and
204 respectively.

Ihe Executive Committee will

take applications from the junior
class to fill the seat left vacant by
the death of Kevin Baker.

Chaffin and Baker were fatally
injured in an automobile accident
early Sunday morning near Wood-
stock, Virginia, while returning from

Governor Names Huntley

Robert E. R. Huntley, president
of Washington and Lee University,
was named to the Virginia State
Board of Education Wednesday by
Governor Linwood Holton.

Huntley and Preston Caruthers,
chairman of the Arlington County
School Board, were appointed to
four-year terms on the board. They
will replace Anne Dobie Beebles of
Dinwiddie County, outgoing presi-
dent of the board, and Stuart Wheat-
ley of Danville, both of whom are
ineligible for reappointment accord-
ing to state law.

The seven-member board estab-
lishes policy for Virginia’s public
elementary and high schools.

The board members themselves
will elect a new chairman to re-
place Miss Peebles. It has been
speculated that Waldo G. Miles, a
Bristol attorney and the group's
senior member, will be chosen to
fill the post.

The nominations are the first that
Holton, a Washington and Lee
alumnus, has made to a state board
since taking office Jan. 17. Both
nominations are subject to approval
by the General Assembly.

The appointments of Huntley and
Caruthers will bring youth to the
board. Huntley, 40, will be the
youngest member as well as the only
one from a college or university.

Huntley, originally a Democrat
but later a Republican and a strong
supporter of Holton’s gubernatorial
bid last year, is the fifth college
president to hold a seat on the
board in this century.

After receiving the appointment,
he commented, “I appreciate being
given the opportunity to be of what-
ever service I can in the field of
public education in Virginia, par-
ticularly since so many decisions

that are important to Virginia’s
future are impending in this field.”

Huntley was born in Winston-
Salem, N.C., and educated in that
city’s public schools. He received
both his undergraduate and law de-
grees from Washington and Lee and
he also holds a master of laws
degree from Harvard University,

He practiced law in Alexandria
until he was named assistant pro-
fessor of law at W&L in 1958. He
became dean of the School of Law
in 1967 and president of the uni-
versity in 1968.

Caruthers, 43, is a native of Cov-
ington, Okla., and a graduate of
George Washington University in
Washington, D.C, Like Huntley he

the governor during the campaign.

He is president of both Preston

Parking Restricted
On Nelson Street

Lexington City Council decided
last week to prohibit parking on
three blocks of Nelson Street dur-
ing the peak traffic period from 4
p.m. to 6 p.m.

No parking will be allowed on
Nelson Street between Randolph
Street and Lee Avenue during that
time.

City Manager Guy B. Agnor said
yesterday that the restriction would
go into effect “hopefully next week,”

Ju Paintings to Be Shown

In Bookstore in March

An exhibit of recent paintings by
I-Hsiung Ju, Washington and Lee's
artist-in-residence, will be located
in the University Bookstore during
March, according to Mrs. Betty
Munger, bookstore manager.

The exhibition will open Monday.

An informal coffee for Mr. and
Mrs. Ju will be held from 4 to §
p.m. Tuesday at the bookstore, Mrs.
Munger said.

The exhibition will include paint-
ings done by Ju since he came to
Washington and Lee last fall.

A native of Kiangsu, China, Ju
received the A.B. degree at the
University of Amoy, China, and the
M.A. at the University of Santo
Tomas, Manila, Philippines. Before
coming to Washington and Lee, he
was a Visiting scholar-in-residence
at four New England state universi-
ties.

Mr. Ju has also taught at the
University of the East and the Uni-
versity of Santo Tomas, both in the
Phileppines. Exhibitions of his work

on the completion of the appropri-

Council also requested that bus
and truck traffic be routed through
the city in a manner that would
eliminate their turns onto and off
of Nelson Street in the center of the
city.

Agnor said traffic to Lexington
coming from the north on US. 11
was to be routed onto the Route 11
bypass instead of coming into the
center of town as it does now.

Agnor noted at the council meet-
ing that the parking ban would pre-

some cars being towed away, especi-
ally at the start of the program.

In a discussion of traffic and park-

Waddell School next year.

Together Again

The Development Office has recently begun to utilize to
a greater extent the student resources available for its pur-
poses. Charged with speaking to the general public in an
effort to attract support for W&L, that office has found
students to be a valuable asset. There are other offices of the
University that could use students with as much success.

The role students can play is not merely a critical one,
although as the Executive Committee’s report on admissions
demonstrates, such a role can be functional and indeed vital.
Rather, students can be best employed as among the Uni-
versity’s emissaries to the groups it wishes to address. Mem-
bers of the EC have been employed recently with favorable
results at alumni meetings, and there are indications that
students will be utilized in other areas, too.

Of course, there are still resources to be tapped, but we
are encouraged at the willingness to use students and by
the fact that they are apparently having the intended effect
of demonstrating, rather than describing, the present nature
of the University to those whose primary focus is elsewhere.

This certainly bears on the University’s relations with
those outside the community to whom it must communicate.
But also significant is its import for the community itself.
To us it indicates a new spirit of willingness to work together,
academically and pragmatically, that seems to be appearing
among students, faculty and administration like. We had al-
most despaired of finding such indications again, but their
reappearance offers us hope that W&L will proceed more
ideally than it ever has in an atmosphere of shared concerns.

A Begmning

This is the last Friday Ring-tum Phi the Publications
Board conceives of printing in the foreseeable future. Be-
ginning Wednesday the Ring-tum Phi will publish a weekly
six-page paper which will be the result of the combined efforts
of the staffs of the two present newspapers.

The publication of two papers a week, managed by
separate staffs, has served the University well but has for
some time been guilty of shortcomings that are virtually
uncorrectable in a four-page paper. Hence, the merger.

We have mixed feelings about the end of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi. The effort to serve an institution in the pres-
ent set-up has been as rewarding as it has been frustrating,
and in many ways we regret the passing of the distinct
identities readers of the two papers could discern.

Yet the academic community needs to be served by a
newspaper that can broaden the scope of its coverage and
at the same time deal with its stories in more depth than
has previously been possible. The weekly edition we hope
will serve that function without being overburdened by the
necessity of repeating itself, a syndrome the two papers had
fallen into.

It will be a great deal more difficult for a combined staff
to publish a six-page paper on Wednesday than it was for
two staffs to publish once a week each. Especially if we are
to offer also the increase in quality we have predicted will
there be more problems. But we are eager to accept the
challenge and will find the reward in meeting our responsi-
bility to the community more fully than we have been able
to do up to now.

A New Service
WLUR’'s scheduling of the Metropolitan Opera perform-

ances, an exclusive service in the area, is among the most
notable undertakings that radio station has embarked upon.
It is also among the most courageous.

WLUR has for some time gone to great length to pro-
vide the students and the community with coverage on pub-
lic events and issues, and it has succeeded admirably. It takes
a particular kind of fortitude, however, to move from a
public service the importance of which everyone agrees on
to one whose public acceptance is at best unpredictable.

It is easy to understand why no commercial station in
the area has chosen to carry the Met's broadcasts. They
cannot count on attracting with them the audiences they
draw for their present programming, and, given financial
pressures, they are reluctant to experiment.

Although the pressures on WLUR are not financial—
Texaco offers the series free—the station is nonetheless
obligated to its public to provide programs of interest and
therefore will probably hear many complaints from patrons
unsympathetic with operatic fare who will assert that no-
body listens to opera nowadays.

But there is, we believe, a significant number of listerners
who will enjoy the broadcasts to justify their being aired.
At any rate, WLUR is fulfilling a function—that of ex-
perimentation—for which a college station is much better
equipped than a commercial one. And in this instance, it
is also fulfilling another major role—that of complementing
commercial productions with cultural programs regular bud-
pets cannot prov ide for.

Coeducation: Ivy League and W&L

By MONTY COTTIER

In his article in last Tuesday's
Phi, Dr. Sharff posed several ques-
tions concerning the changes which
have either been proposed, may be
proposed, or are “in the winds,”
such as coeducation and the aboli-
tion of the “in loco parentis” idea
of a university’s role. The problem
with such an approach, however,
often is that the student is faced
with nothing but a list of such ques-
tions, with nothing on which to base
a reply.

Taking the problem of coeduca-
tion, for example, a more useful
approach might be found in ex-
amining situations in which it had
already been tried and seeing what
the results were. In the Ivy League
schools such as Yale and Princeton,
both of which opened their doors
to women students this fall, the re-
actions ranged from “playing footsie
under the study desks” to treating
the girls with what one co-ed term-
ed “the buddy system” (The Wash-
ington Post, February 25).

As Dr. Sharff pointed out, the
atmosphere of the classes will un-
doubtably be changed, both in the
lectures of the professors and in
the students’ responses to them. A
Princeton student expressed the
problem by saying, “There's a girl

in my philosophy class, and she’s
amazingly conspicuous. Everyone's
waiting for her to say something.”

With this trend might go, too,
the idea that in a group of girls
as small as that of the co-eds would
probably be, whatever one might
say to a class of men would run
the risk of coming out sounding like
a policy statement on behalf of all
womankind, On the other hand, the
fact keeps returning to mind that
we have gone so long without the
classroom expression of any opinion
other than that of fellow males that
any change would be welcome.

It would certainly be a major
problem to assimilate co-eds into
the W&L scholastic environment;
although if the recent Co-ed Week
is any indication, the girls might
well be quite capable of handling
that problem themselves. The cruc-
ial test could well be, as many
said it was in Princeton’s and Yale’s
case, in the transition from scho-
lastics to social considerations, or
vice versa. After all, most of the
girls will probably be from the
nearby girls’ schools, and will know
someone or several people here al-
ready. That this might initially be

a source of difficulty is possible, but
that it might also provide a means
of bridging the gap for males and
females alike should also be con-
sidered,

Too, the opportunities for dating
are much better if girls are a part
of the general scene and may be
met on a more relaxed level than
is usually found in the average blind
date or random selection from a
facebook. Of course, they are not
your dates exclusively. They are
everyone’s dates, which makes them
anyone’s On an open competition

On Stop, Environmental Group

By DAVID OLSON

Two groups have recently been

concerned with important and
topical issues. STOP and the En-

these seem to be well on their way

On A Cockpit Dilemma

Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:

On a recent Friday night | went
to the University Center for a few
beers and was most disturbed by
what I saw there. | am referring
to the presence of. so many towns-
people. Nearly half the crowd in the
Cockpit and a majority of the group
in the game room were composed
of these people.

This is upsetting for two reasons.
The first is that the “Cockpit” is in
the University Center, which was
built for the entertainment and plea-
sure of the University community—
faculty, students, administrators,

and their guests. If the “Cockpit”
is continually frequented by “town-
ies” I believe that it will lose its
appeal for students. It wil lbecome
little more than an elegant version
of the “Corner Grill” (Doc’s).

It is the one place in town that
we as students can call our own—
let's keep it that way! It seems to
me that this should be a_ private
club-type arrangement; membership
to which is contingent upon associa-
tion with the University community.

The second point is strictly fi-
nancial in nature. It is my under-
standing that there is a danger that
the “Cockpit” would be more sub-
ject to local taxation if it were

An Apology To

By LAWRENCE MeCONNELL

Upon reading Mr. Robert Steck’s
reply to my two week old article,
I began wondering whether or not
I was right in attacking Mr. Ram-
sey Clark’s speech. And after over-
hearing a disquieting story concern-
cerning the little known kingdom
of Pretzelvania, my doubts began to
concretize into an ignominious fe-
cognition of my error.

1 feel compelled to share this
story with the reader in the hope
that he too will recognize the grave
error in my thought which I assure
the world will not ever be publicly
displayed again, unless of course
there is a great demand for those
writers whose works are carrion for
error-seeking vultures.

Before | began to relate this
tale, | must express my indebied-
ness to Mr. Steck, without whose
letter this reply would not have
been possible. In his note, he elo-
quently instructed our mutual read-
ers, as well as myself, about the
central, over-weaning error in my
analysis: to wit. that I did not con-
tend (perchance agree) with the
focus of Mr. Clark's talk which was
based on the popular premise: ma
terial deprivation breeds disrespect
for the law, As everyone will agree,
this premise is the corollary to a
more general one that one’s native

habitat determines one’s essential
character.
Here, | would suggest (for the

benefit of all those rather garrulous
yet busy bodies of erudite men) a
better pharse which will be much
more striking and memorable in a
heated argument: “You are where
you live.” Not only is this phrase
catchy, but it also appeals to the
emotional and intellectual thirst of
the average man to know exactly
who and what he is, For, as a lost
traveler on a long journey who
stops hastily fer directions, he does
not have time to listen to the
lengthy reminiscences of a local
resident: he must be on his way
quickly. This phrase therefore pro
vides men of all backerounds with
a simple litmus paper test by which

he may judge where he stands in
relation to the world. If he lives in
a ghetio, his nature is ghetto-like:

his mind is full of trashy thoughts
like the garbage in his gutter. If he
is a resident in a middle class neigh
borhood, his essence is middle class

his mind as narrow as the wheel
base on his compact car. And if
he lives in an opulent section of
the city, he
cormicopia of

must have a veritable

knowledge to equal

the amount of money he has,

But to return to the purpose, my
main intent in writing this article
was to confess to Mr. Steck that I
indeed was at fault in my essay of
several weeks ago. The main evi-
dence for this embarrassing admis-
sion can be found in the tragic tale
of Pretzelvania, which if the reader
will have patience, | will relate in
the following paragraphs.

Nestled in the Carpathian moun-
tains, Pretzelvania is a  couniry
noted for its cultural progress as
well as its economic stability. Its
leader, Prince Ali Kazaam, was for-
tunately far-sighted, but regreti-
ably short on patience. The Prince's
Minisier of Public Well-Being had
delivered a report to his highness
concerning the unruly people who
lived in the unbeneficial areas of
Prtezelvania.

Attentive to his constituency, the
wise Prince decided he had better
do something progressive and vis-
ionary or else run the risk of dis-
order spreading throughout the
kingdom. After highdevel confer-
ences with his Ministers of Cultural
Enrichment and Economic Security,
he concluded that with the distribu-
tion of an ample supply of money
and books in the unbeneficial sec-
tions of Pretzelvania, the turmoil
would cease. He justified this action
from his reading of three docu-
ments his library: one by Machia-
velli, another which was entitled the
Constitution of the United States,
and the third which was a book by
a noted American sociologist, He
reasoned thusly: (a) he as prince
was the supreme administrator of
justice, (B) all the people in his
land were to be equal before him,
and (c) the law he administered
produced different results in vary
ing social conditions. Thus, if Preiz-
elvania had one social condition, the
resulis of his administration or jus-
tice would be the same for all
cases,

To accomplish this, his ministers
told him, it would be necessary to
go to the people who had libraries
anf money in the nation to give
their books and shingles (a flat,
retangular object composed of slate
used as the basic monetary unit of
the country, its advantage being
that it could be broken into smaller
monetary units by a simple smack
on a tabletop)

Prince Kazaam issued a decree
that this be done and personally
heard of little resentment from the
owners of books umd shingles ubout

organized in January and has been
concerned first with the Vietnam
war, the draft and ROTC. The
group has committees for research,
public relations and programs and
has started some interesting things.
The Research Committee has al-
ready drawn up a draft booklet call-
ed “The Draft Digest” which should
appear sometime today. They also
plan to hear from Captain Owen of
the ROTC department sometime in
the next week. The draft booklet
is especially important in that it
pertains to the new lottery system
and there certainly is a lack of
material on the new system. Hope-
fully this new booklet will clear up
many of the uncertainties that have
haunted all of us since the lottery
was adopted. They have also been
compiling information on Vietnami-
zation and related issues. To this
writer they appear to be a con-
cerned and dedicated group. They
are well organized and have a num-
ber of panel discussions coming up
next month. We should be hearing
a lot from STOP in the future.

The Environmental Concern
group also appears to be on the
way to a certain degree of success.
While STOP is basically concerned
with the college community, the
Envioronmental Concern group is
directing its attention to the Lex-
ington Community,

As Ron Sklar, temporary co-
chairman of the group, told me, Lex-

ington has no great pollution prob-
lem but there are subtle things that
the community should be concern-
ed about. One of their primary ob-
jectives is getting a symposium,
hopefully in Lee Chapel, to discuss
the question of Marble Valley.
Marble Valley is beyond Goshen
and is one of the scenic spots in
this area. It also has a number of
old (circa 1700) houses that should
be preserved. However, Vepco plans
to dam up the Maury River at this
point to produce a hydro-electric
power plant. Not only would this
destroy the houses in Marble Val-
ley but it would make the Maury
River around Goshen all but a
trickle, which would destroy a fa-
vorite W&L pastime—tubing. The
Environmental Concern group has
not taken a stand on the issue but
it feels that the proposition should
be discussed in front of the com-
munity. Whether the need for
electrical power is so great that such
a scenic area would have to be
marred is open to question and it
is this question that will be dealt
with at the Symposium on March
II.

These two groups are good for the
campus community and maybe they
will finally stir the W&L student
out of his historic apathy. Never-
theless they have formed and they
are taking actions and getting in-
volved, something that has been
lacking in the past.

Steck-And Swift

possessions. Within weeks, almost
everyone had an equal number of
books and shingles; the Minister of
Public Well-Being assured the
Prince all was indeed well. But the
Ministers of Cultural Enrichment
and Economic Security had other
news. Thing were not just a bowl
of oatmeal (a rare delicacy in Pretz-
elvania).

As is often the case, those from
the unbeneficial areas of Pretzel-
vania (which were now classified as
living in beneficial areas by the
Minister of Well-Being) were still
living tumultuous lives. They were
burning their books in their fire-
places to save shingles on firewood,
while they delighted so much in
cracking their shingles to pieces
that they lost all the money they
had been given. On top of all this
trouble, those who had given away
some of their books and shingles
had theatened to storm the palace
!o overthrow the prince if he didn't
do something about protecting them
from the rioting masses in the newly
designated beneficial sections.

The Prince lost his patience. The
Minster of Well-Being was frantic-
ally pleading with his highness to
give the idea another chance—all
that was needed was a little more
time to beneficialize the populace
But the Prince was short-tempered
and ordered all the rioters shot.
Unfortunately, this meant disaster
for the country because the more
people they shot, the more rioters

people they shot, the more rioters
the whole population of the country
was reduced to two—the Prince and
his Minister of Well-Being (the Min-
ister of Cultural Enrichment was
killed in a library fire and the
Minister of Economic Security met
an untimely end when he was fatally
hit in the head with the shrapnel
from a thrown shingle).

Mr. Steck was right; | was wrong.
For any writer who is steadfast in
his beliefs and principles, such an
admission is doubly painful. In view
of my error, | have now taken
Steps to remedy my afflicted con-
science in hope that my readers
and eventually Mr. Steck himself
will follow my belated example.

First, for those who are unduly
penurious, I direct them to the
example of the Prince. Had he given
away his books and shingles, he
would have still had a populated
country in which to dwell because
there would have been no prince
to overthrow and hence no need
for violence. He too would have
lived as others in a new kingdom
in which equal people govern them-
selves equally.

I humbly ask of Mr. Steck and
my readers two favors which no
sensible gentleman could deny: (1)
that they join me in a new life
of selling pencils on the streets of
this fair city, and (2) that they
remember the ultimate precept of
charity: “to err is human; to for-
give, divine.”

And so an era has come to an
end. The glory days of Magic Mel
and his talented friends have passed.
The important CAC tournament is
still to come, to be played in dis-
tant lands, though. So for most
of us the season is over. Shoe-box
Doremus will no longer be graced

by the superlative foursome of
Cartwright, Neer, Morrison, and
Fauber, Yet there could not have

been a more fitting finale than the
spectacular that was witnessed Tues-
day night. Virginia Commonwealth
was the hapless opponent.

Lest we forget them, the game
served as a reminder of outstand-

players mentioned above . . . Cart-
wright, twisting, turning, slithering
through a maze of players and lay-
ing the ball ever-so-gently into the
basket . . . Big Mike sweeping the
ball off the boards with authority
‘ Morrison swishing his shots,
passing with such a delicate touch
that it brought the crowd to its
feet several times and Fauber, sym-
bol of the consistency and endur-
ance that characterized his team
for four years. One by one they left
the court, victory firmly in hand,
met by thunderous applause, and the
boundless gratitude of other play-
ers, friends, students, and faculty.

But then a funny thing happened

. the applause did not stop. It
was not so funny, really it was
great. It was a tribute to the play-
ers, and it was a tribute to the
man who had built this team. And
there he was, Coach Verne Can-
field, beating his foot on a desk,
joining the throng in giving well-
deserved thanks to his players. The
deafening cheers, the back-slapping
of the players, the Swing being start-
ed and then lost in the confusion.
It was bedlam. It was great.

But it’s over. And to the relatively

unproven talents of Stones, Mce-
Clures, and Glaces falls the task
of following-in-the-footsteps. T he

crowds that came out to watch the
likes of Neer and Cartwright more
than emphasized the shortcomings
of old Doremus gym, and it is being
modernized accordingly. To those
departing then, thank you. To their
replacements, what possible encore?

Washington and Lee drubbed Vir-
ginia Commonwealth 87-71 Tuesday
and prepared for this weekends’
College Athletic Conference tourna-
ment. In a stormy match with
the Rams, who had previously won
a 90-83 decision earlier this year,
the Generals sprinted to an early
lead and coasted to victory behind

Mike Neer, Mel Cartwright, Stu
Fauber, and Norwood Morrison.
The quartet, all seniors, played

their last game in Doremus Gym,
compiling in their four years at
Washington and Lee a 73-24 won-

loss record,

The Generals, along with hosting
Washington University and the de-
fending champions, Southwestern
of Memphis, are one of three teams
favored to win the tournament which
began last night in St. Louis.

Washington and Lee and South-
western both possess 15-8 records,
but the Generals won the coin toss
and the top seeding. As a result,
the Generals will face the winner

of the Centre College-Sewanee en-
counter tonight in the semifinals.

W&L Out to Defeat
Sewanee at CAC Meet

Today, the W&L natators begin
competition in the fourth C.A.C.
swimming championships. The Blue
natators are out to defeat the
Sewanee team who managed a nar-
row victory last year. Besides WAI
and Sewanee, Washington Univer-
sity has the only other strong team.
Both the host Centre University and
Southwestern have new swimming
programs and will more than likely
not be a factor in final results of the
championship.

Sewanee has won two out of

the three championships which
shows the continual, sustained
strength of their swimming pro-

gram. Coach Stearns noted that he
was very interested in having the
team perform well in this meet.
He was satisfied with last week's
second place finish in the Virginia
State Intercollegiate Swimming
Championships, but noted that the
team has been preparing for the
last month with the C.A.C.’s as
their major objective.

The championship and consola-

night. Last year at Memphis, the
Lynx strolled past the Generals 73-

ending Washington and Lee’s two-
year reign as conference champs.

Going into tonight’s contest, Neer,
Cartwright, and sophomore Mike

averaging 17.4 points a game, with

Institute Discussion Group
To Discuss Nat Turner Novel

One of a series of panel discus-
sions sponsored by the Summer
Reading Program at Virginia Insti-
tute will be held Tuesday.

The discussion will deal with “Nat
Turner: The Negro Revolt.” A ques-
tion and answer period will follow.

The program will begin at 7:30
p.m. in VMI’s Lejeune Hall. It is
open to the public.

Two primary sources will com-
prise the background for the sym-
posium. The first is William Styron’s
best-selling historical novel, “The

Confession of Nat Turner,” and the
second is “William Styron’s Nat
Turner: Ten Black Writers Re-
spond,” a critical reaction to the
book.

Swim Team

* Goes to CAC

(Continued from Page 3)

Both Bill Brumback and John
Lawlor will be keys to the Gen-
erals’ hopes for a victory. Brumback
holds the CAC records in the 50
and 100 yard freestyle which he
won in last year’s competition. Like-
wise Lawlor holds the record in
the 500 and 1650 yard freestyle
events which he won last year.

Other keys to General success are
Bim Clark and freshman, Alan
Corwith. Clark presently holds the
CAC records in the 100 and 200
yard butterfly events which he set
during the season. Corwith has con-
tinually broken the CAC record in
the 200 yard freestyle. Coach Stearns
hopes that these two swimmers will
win more than their share of the
events. Coach Stearns also noted
that the W&L team has exceptional
depth and that in a meet of this
nature every sixth place point will
count,
