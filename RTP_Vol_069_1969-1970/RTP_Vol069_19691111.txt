OAS to choose
advisers for its
annual meeting

By Mil Hatcher

Twenty-four delegation advisers
for the second annual Washington
and Lee Model Organization of
American States will be selected at
“ve weekly meeting in Room 208 of
the University Center on Tuesday,
November 18, at 7:30 p.m.

Thomas L. Osborne, a senior at
George Washington University, has
been tapped as president of the plen-
ary sessions. Osborne is a member
of the G.W.U, Commission on
Model Government and has served
as Secretary-General of the National
Model OAS.

In addition, applications for posi-
tions on the minimum of four dele-
gations exclusively manned by Wash-
ington and Lee students will be ac-
cepted at the Tuesday meeting. If
unable to attend in person, applica-
tions should be mailed to the Politi-
cal Science Club and International
Relations Association, Box 1229.

This year, W&L is host to the only
eastern seaboard Model OAS. At
present, plans call for a somewhat
different plan from last year’s Inter-
American Conference. If the revised
charter is passed by the OAS mem-
ber nations as expected, the March
13-14 Model will simulate the Or-
ganization’s newly created General
Assembly.

Approximately 150 invitations are
being extended to various Eastern
schools. Already indicating an in-
tention to attend are delegations
from Princeton, George Washing-
ton, the U.Va. graduate school in
International Relations, Randolph-
Macon, Sweet Briar, Hollins, Mary
Baldwin, Madison, VMI, and South-
ern Seminary.

The W&L’s Model General Sec-
retariat is under the direction of the
Political Science Club and Inter-
national Relations Association, Of-
ficers include: John Motsinger, Sec-
retary-General; Ronny Abrams, Sec-
retary; Charlie Holt, Treasurer; Mil-
ford Hatcher, Information Director,
and O. N. Otto and John Hinshaw,
Assistant Secretaries-General for
Delegations.

IFC meets Monday night,

on the amendments passed two
weeks ago was taken. The amend-
ments passed [4-2-2, President Cahn
warned fraternities with tentative
approval on parietal plans to resub-

living in houses, “borrowing” be-
tween fraternities, and disturbing
activities in Red Square. The meeting
was adjourned; the next meeting will
be in two weeks, Monday, Novem-
ber 24.

Seniors to

research

1969 flood in seminar

Eight W&L seniors are undertak-
ing a survey of Rockbridge County
residents who were affected by last
August's flood. The survey is part of
their study in a political science-
sociology course. Dr. William Buch-
anan, professor of political science,
explained that the students are un-
dertaking the survey as part of a
senior seminar on research methods.
“The purpose of the survey is to
study the reactions of people in un-
expected emergencies and their ad-
justment to the changes in living
conditions,” said Dr. Buchanan.

The eight students are Dave Field,
Tom Metcalf, Chris Habers, Bob
Skinner, Joe Raine, Charlie Holt,
Homer Gamble and George Ham-
lin. The students will seek the co-
operation of the residents in answer-
ing a questionnaire which attempts
to determine what happened to the
people before, during, and after the

The Race Relations Seminar ori-
ginally scheduled for Thursday, No-

Campus. The Seminar will discuss

flood. The survey should take about
two weeks to complete.

The students will attempt to in-
terview approximately one of every
three families located in the disaster
area. The students will seek the vic-
tims at their homes, or, in the cases
of persons whose homes were des-
troyed by flood, they will attempt to
locate the persons elsewhere.

The data collected by the octet
will be kept on file in the archives
of the political science department
of Washington and Lee and will be
available to anyone in future years
who is interested in the flood of
1969.

Cast for ‘Lear’

Washington and Lee's Trouba-
dours are now preparing for their
second offering of this season, “King
Lear.” Shakespeare's famous work
concerning a retired king and fealty
will be presented the week before
Christmas vacation.

Tryouts for the production were
held on Wednesday and Thursday
evening of last week in the Trouba-
dour Theatre. In the two days, fifty-
eight read for the some twenty-five
parts. The tentative cast for the pro-
duction is as follows:

Agnew article claims, ‘Dick loves Ted’

By Lex McMillan

Ihe November 7 edition of Time published a very
imteresting article entitled, The Vice-Presidency “Dick
Loves Ted”, This column seemed to be one of the most
accurate and logical explanations and interpretations of
our Vice-President, Spiro Agnew. The head of the story
was not meant to be ironic though to many it would
seem not surprising. This administration's second man
has proved to be quite vocal as opposed to past holders
of his office

As a result of his highly inflamatery opinions, he
has drawn fire from many public fronts. There are many
who consider him a bumbling boob, Though | tend to
lean in favor of this attitude, the article in Thme showed
me that there could very definitely be a method to the
madness that Agnew seems to be carrying on. As the
article pointed out, “ those who have been most of-
fended are in the main liberals, who are down on the
Administration anyway.” This is probably a valid point
however, there must be some who voted for Nixon as
i did and still support him and yet have a low regard
for Agnew’s fiery condemnation of all supporters of the
Moratorium

Nixen perhaps has fooled people like myself into
believing that he is more liberal than he really is
Though Nixon was quoted as gently-chiding Agnew, in
the main he has supported and lauded his actions, This
dillusions me when | think that Nixon could have
only gentle reproof for 4 statement such as Agnew's

description of the Moratorium supporters, The Vice
President called them an “effete corps of impudent
snobs,” | supported the moratorium wholeheariedly

and | feel neither effete nor impudent nor snobish,

1 think that Agnew's attitudes and his statements
which reflect them portray a snobish and one sided
view of a question which requires open minded con-
sideration of the many facets of answers, I feel that
Agnew has succumbed to emotionalism in dealing with
this problem

His hints of a purge to rid the society of militant
ami-war leaders is frightening. He described them as
“parasites of passion,” “merchants of hate”, and “vul
tures”. He compared their weeding oui to that of the
discarding of rotien apples. This attitude seems very

alien to the principles upon which this country was
founded

One very imporiant function that Agnew could be
serving is that of drawing fire away from Nixon, and
his Was pointed out in the article. In this way Nixon
can get his jabs in and satisfy a conservative clement
while pretending to be milder than he is to please the
liberal element. This ix just a matter of political jugg
ling which is nothing new to the Nixon administration
in fact. the machinations of politicians trying to please
all the people existed even before this country had
political parties. As long as ambition is an element in

American culture this form of action will continue to

erin
However, it seems that too few people realize that
Anew is serving this Purpose I am just becoming

aware that Agnew is not really a faux pas of Nixon but
more than likely a calculated move to “keep the South
safe from George Wallace.” Somehow | just don't feel

EC requests students for
participation in recruiting

In an hour and a half session, the
Executive Committee passed two
resolutions, forwarded a letter of
opinion to the Ring-tum Phi (see
page two), and heard a report from
the Curriculum Committee.

Chip Schooley, chairman of that
committee, discussed the schedule
changes approved by the faculty, He
reported that he was unaware that
so little publicity would be accorded
to the changes and that student opin-
ion would be virtually ignored. Ogil-
vie reported that afternoon classes
would be essential in the new short
term but lamented that “student
Opinion was not sought and that no
attempt was made to enlighten the
student body in regard to this im-
portant change.”

Schooley further reported that the
Curriculum Committee had com-
pleted a study of the pass-fail sys-
tem and that they recommended one
pass-fail course be allowed per sem-
ester for sophomores also. It was
pointed out that such a system would
be particularly beneficial to overload
students, The independent exam
schedule and the adviser system were
discussed in depth and several re-
commendations were made by
Schooley.

The prime emphasis of the meet-
ing, according to Bethea, was the
passing of a resolution regarding un-
derprivileged applicants to W&lL.
The resolution was proposed by
Bethea and the vote in favor was un-
animous, The text reads:

WHEREAS the Executive Com-
mittee feels that Washington and
Lee University needs to assume
greater responsibility towards the
education of the qualified underpri-
vileged and

WHEREAS we recognize the dif-
ficulty Washington and Lee has had
in the past in attracting qualified
students from minority groups, and

WHEREAS the Executive Com-
mittee through the power granted it
by the Student Body hereby wishes
to undertake a sincere attempt to
remedy this unbalanced situation,

BE IT RESOLVED THAT the
Executive Committee appoint a com-
mittee with the following two-fold
purpose:

1) To thoroughly research the meth-
ods, approaches, and problems
encountered in the recruitment
of the underprivileged, with par-
ticular interest given to recruit-
ing that group which is conspicu-
ously lacking on our campus—
the Negro.

 

2) After extensive research a report
shall be made on December 15
to the Executive Committee con-
cerning these findings:

a) The discontinuance of the
committee if it be reported
that any recruitment plan is
inoperative.

b) The extension of more time
for further research.

¢) The implementation of a plan
for recruitment if such a plan
is recommended by the com-
mittee and approved by the
Executive Committee.

When and if such a plan be rec-
ommended and approved, the re-
searching committee may become a
sub-committee under the Executive
Committee. Upon the implementa-
tion of a plan, this sub-committee
will work in conjunction and under
the aegis of the Admissions Office.

The committee, headed by Bethea,
was appointed and consists of Azu-
ma, Dobbins, and Markham. Appli-
cations are now being sought from
members of the student body. They
must be turned in to the EC mail-
box in the Student Center by 6
p.m. Sunday.

Kumpuris made a resolution to
voice the EC’s dissatisfaction with
the faculty's handling of next year’s
schedule. He dropped his proposal in
favor of a letter to the Ring-tum Phi,

which is printed on page two.
Thompson reported the findings of
the law student’s housing committee.
Mosby Perrow, representing the Law
School proposed: “That all Univer-
sity housing units in Hillside Terrace
and Davidson Park be made avail
able to student couples before be-
ing opened to faculty couples.” Also,
“That all faculty families now re-
siding in Davidson Park and Hill-
side Terrace be relocated outside of
these units by 30 June, 1970.”

The motion passed unanimously.
The procedure will now be to relay
the resolution to Dean Steinheimer
and President Huntley for their re-
ferral to the faculty. Thompson pro-
posed that an amendment be added
to recognize the individual needs of
students living in the two parks,
The amendment also passed unani-
mously.

Tompkins reported that $400 had
been allocated to the Law Review.
He also proposed that an Executive
Committeeman be appointed to head
a committee to investigate co-educa-
tion, Kevin Baker was chosen as he
reported that he had been discussing
co-education with Dr. Hodges.

Henberg announced that the sub-
committee concerning faculty re-
gulations and their codification has
met and a report will be made prior
to Christmas vacation.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Tuesday, November 11, 1969

At least an audience

The drafting of the framework of the new class schedule
was evidently handled by the faculty without any formal con-
sultation with the student body. Moreover, the adoption of
this new plan at the November faculty meeting came as a
complete surprise to the student body. Prior to the conclusive
vote eight days ago, no official notification had emanated
from Washington Hall, or any Hall, that the faculty was even
considering action on a new class schedule. Whether this was
a sin of commission or omission on the part of the faculty,
we do not know. In either case, we are most disturbed by this
exclusion of student participation.

That a new scheduling system will be necessary under the
12-12-6 is obvious. That the faculty devised and decreed this
new schedule without enlisting the coopeartion of the student

body is discouraging.

The Executive Committee and The Ring-tum Phi, for ex-
ample, devoted a great deal of attention during the past two
years both to studying the issues of short-term and Saturday
classes and to mustering student involvement and expression.
In this final action, these institutions of the student body were
ignored. Nor was the Student Curriculum Committee provid-
ed ample time to discuss the schedule.

The gravity of this situation rests not so much in the
dictates of the statute—for the student body, if consulted,
would probably have concurred, though we can never be sure
~~as in the fact that the sentiment of the students was not in-
vestigated. Yet, this is an issue which clearly and directly af-
fects the daily lives of every one of our 1460 students just as
much as it affects the daily lives of every one of our faculty
members. Furthermore, the matter was relatively uncompli-
cated; that is, it failed to consist of any earth-shaking signi-
fiance, thereby discrediting any excuse for student exclusion

on that premise.

We are therefore puzzled as well as dismayed by this re-
cent insult of the student body on the part of the faculty. We
hope no precedent has been initiated.

Letters to the Editor,
faculty and students

To the students

To the students:

Last night the Executive Com-
mittee initiated action that could
prove to be a crucial test of the
Student Body's willingness to con-
cern itself with the question of its
own make-up. A committee, co-
chaired by Dave Bethea and John
Markham. was set up to study the
feasibiilty of employing student ener-
gies in the recruitment of underpri-
vileged students. Such action was
taken in the interest of a more di-
versified Student Body, both on rac-
ial and economic grounds.

This week, then, the Executive
Committee will be accepting appli-
cations from all persons interested
in working on this project. Success
of this plan will depend upon stu-
dent response, as the resolution stip-
ulates that a report must be given
the Executive Commitiee by Decem-
ber 15 as to the feasibility of em-
ploying student actiivty in this area.

The Executive Committee has
taken a big step toward initiating
this action: its continued momentum
is a direct exponent of the willing-
ness of individual students to de-
voted their time to the project. I
have gathered that there is a lot of
dissatisfatc:on among students as to
the current character of the Wash-
ingion and Lee Student Body, but
so far there has been no concerted
effort among students to remedy the
situation. Hopefully this proposal
will be greeted with enthusiasm, and
I urge all students to give it careful
consideration.

Applications for those interested
should be submitted in the E.C.
mailbox in the University Center by
Sunday, Nov. 16, Interviews will be
held the following day. Monday.
Nov, 17

Again, 1 hope there is a decidedly
favorable response among students
to the Executive Committee's initia-
tive on this crucial issue.

Open Letter to the Faculty

Last Monday at the Faculty’s
monthly meeting the class schedule
for the 12-12-64 curriculum change
was passed. The brief and inadequ-
ite explanation which appeared in
the Tuesday Edition on November
i was the first and only unveiling of
information concerning this major
change in adaptation of the schedul-
ing of classes to the 12-12-6 plan

In the course of the Executive
Committee meeting on that same
Monday, knowledge obtained totally
by chance pertaining to this matter

was conveyed to the members of the
committee. As a result, Staman Ogil-
vie Was appointed to investigate the
possibility of student participation
in the creation of the scheduling
plan. That Tuesday it was learned
that the EC's deliberations were for
naught, as the plan had already been
adopted on the preceding afternoon
by the faculty.

The adoption of this plan was the
result of an extensive questionnaire
aimed at obtaining faculty prefer-
ences, Neither student participation
nor student contribution was solicit-
ed by the faculty committee in
charge of the investigation.

In light of the rapport which
grew last year between faculty and
students, witnessed in the contri-
butions made by students in formu-
lating the final format of the 12-12-6
schedule, and in other vital areas of
change, it is both disturbing and
perplexing that no student opinion
was sought in any form whatsoever.
We must assume that the faculty did
not consider this major decision
needing of student consideration. It
is regrettable that the faculty appar-
ently has decided to spurn the chan-
nels of student sentiment which were
so evident last year.

Our reasons for composing this
letter are that we hope that in fu-
ture matters of change of such im-
port the ideas and feelings of the
student body will again be given
some consideration.

Money leads to fraternity losses

By Roy Carlton
News Editor

Back in the latter part of Septem-
ber Mike Hughes, Lexington corres-
pondent for the Richmond Times-
Dispatch, decided to turn his atten-
tion to a previously undiscussed as-
pect of Washington and Lee frater-
nity life: upperclass deactivation.
From his viewpoint, he saw upper-
class deactivation as a great and
growing threat to the economic sta-
bility of fraternities.

The one thing Hughes failed to
do, however, was to conduct some
kind of study of the actual num-
bers involved in deactivation. Hence,
there was no way of telling exactly
how significant the matter had be-
come.

With a high degree of caution,
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi has ad-
dressed itself to the problem in the
past week, and has compiled the
rather surprising set of statistics
shown below. For various reasons,
approximately the same percentages
of the sophomore and junior classes
belong to fraternities while there is
a marked decrease in the senior
class,

What this seems to indicate is that
a large number of people tend to
drop out of fraternities in their jun-
ior year. Because statistics were not
available to us for last year’s grad-
uating class it would be impossible
for us to show statistically taht this
trend continues through the senior
year. But it would not be reaching
too far to assume that that is the
case.

By the same logic we can deduce
that a much larger percentage stay

Losses threaten fraternity solvency

Fraternities have been firmly en-
trenched at Washington and Lee for
over one hundred years now. They
have dominated the school’s social
life as long as it has had one, and
campus politics have been frater-
nity oriented for decades. In short,
fraternities are just as much a tradi-
tion at WAL as the coat and tie.

The last several years have been
a time of transition for WAL, how-
ever, and there have been changes
fraternities have not been able to
avoid. Traditions have all come un-
der scrutiny to see if there is a value
to them other than their being tradi-
tions. In the process the speaking
tradition seems to have gone by the
wayside, Freshman walk on the grass
at will, Preshman nametags have
all but disappeared, and coat and tie
dress seems to have adopted a looser
interpretation.

As the figures above seem to indi-
caie, upperclassmen are now analyz-
ing fraternities with the same close
attention they devote to WAL’s other
traditions. Most of them find their
fraternity membership to be worth-
while, but a significant number
either don't consider it worth its ex-
pense or don't consider it worth any-
thing.

This decimation of fraternity up-
perclasses by deactivation is com-
plemented by the increased tendency
for students to either transfer or fail
by their senior year. The result is
often the decimation of a fraternity's
senior class. As the table above
shows, there are several houses
which al present retain only a frac-
tion of their original senior class
There are also a few with a deci-
mated junior class for much the
same reasons.

These losses constituie a tremend-
ous loss of revenue to the individual
houses. So much so that yearly now

in their fraternities through their
freshman and sophomore years. This
is quite plausible considering the ad-
vantages and facilities which frater-
nities offer to those classes. Fresh-
men rarely depledge because of the
social necessity of belonging to a
fraternity. Sophomores are in the
worst position to deactivate, because,
by and large, they live in the fra-
ternity houses.

Then is it proper to assume that
the most important motivation for
fraternity existence is the advantages
it offers to underclassmen? Is the
concept of brotherhood and other
principles upon which fraternities
are based so weak that upperclass-
men abandon fraternities once they
are socially self-sufficient? Probably
not. There are still a majority of
seniors in fraternities, and roughly
three quarters of the fraternity men
in the senior class are still active.
Yet, what about the quarter that
have either depledged or deacti-
vated.

After interviewing a considerable
number of deactivates from several
houses, one common reason seems
to stand out most often. Fraternities
are too expensive. By the junior and
senior years almost all fraternity
men live in apartments, usually with
kitchens. With these added expenses
(no one can deny living in a frater-
nity house is cheaper than renting
an apartment), fraternity bills be-
come a heavy load.

By the upperclass years the pri-
mary advantage a fraternity offers
is that of being a place at which to
eat cheaply. Yet even this loses its
attraction to upperclassmen. As one

 

No. of No, still No. of

there are cries that this house or an-
other house either cannot pay its
bills er won't be able to raise enough
money to pay future ones.

On top of this it has been the goal
of the faculty to institute some kind
of deferred rush sysiem. The idea
is that this will give entering stu-
dents a better chance to evaluate the
wisdom of joining a fraternity so
that each one will be able to decide
for himself, rather than being forced
to join a house. Undoubiedly this
would be the case, but, all vaiue
judgments aside, it would be crippl-
ing to fraternities in that they would
be deprived of badly needed fresh-
man funds for a semesier, In cases
such as in the last two years when
one of more houses have gone inio
rush with less than twenly actives ot
close to it, deferred rush would be a
death blow,

The result of these pressures upon
fraternities has been to attach add-
ed importance upon a good rush,
and more and more, a large one.
It can Be seen from the table that it
is the houses with the greatest losses
that try to pledge the largest classes.
Sometimes, of course, the small
number of actives is readily appar-
ent to freshmen who then begin to
have second doubis.

A large rush, however, can nol
make up for the factors that eventu
ally lead to deactivation. These must
be corrected from within and it is
questionable that fraternities have
tried to do this or have even been

 

deactivate said: “By the time I'd
add my social dues to my board, I'd
be paying over a hundred dollars a
month to eat at the house. I guess I
spend about forty-five dollars a
month for food now. That includes
two meals a day, like I'd get at the
house, plus some snacks,”

Analyzing the statement of this
student, it would seem as if he feels
he’s getting nothing for his social
dues. This is a frequent cause for
disgruntlement. By the time a frater-
nity man has an apartment, he has
established contacts at the girls’
schools, It is also probable that
either he or his roommate has a car.
Thus with a place to party, contacts,
and a car at his disposal, there is
little material advantage to an up-
perclassman’s fraternity member-
ship.

While economics seems to be the
most frequent reason for deactiva-
tion, there are several other promin-
ent ones. These center around gen-
eral disillusionment with the frater-
nity system as a whole, Because
there is such an emphasis at W&L
upon pledging a house during the
freshman year, many students join
fraternities when they wouldn't con-
sider it at another school. For some
of these people, the fraternity proves
to be a much better organization
than they had thought. But for
others, dissatisfaction with fraterni-
ties quickly sets in.

This disillusionment takes several
forms. Some deactivates cite a lack
of brotherhood in fraternities behind
a great facade of close friendship.
They note that fraternities are quite
often divided against themselves.

able. Disillusionment with the fra-
ternity system as a whole is a very
hard thing for fraternities to counter.
Then too, how can a fraternity ease
financial burdens upon its members
when it is in difficult financial straits
itself? The answer is that it cannot
and shouldn't try. The answer lies
elsewhere.

The problem is twofold, Frater-
nities afte losing members from
withdrawals and deactivations, Be-
cause most of these withdrawals are
transfers to easier schools or because
of failure, the solution lies in in-
creased fraternity attention to aca-
demics. The greater part of deactiva-
tion can be prevented by generating
a greater spirit of brotherhood in the
fraternity so as to make non-mem-
bership dissatisfying.

Academics is not entirely neglect-
ed by houses upon this campus.
Most houses have a cold quiz file of
some kind. Big Brother programs
which are campus-wide do show
some concern for studies. Bul there
is little constructive action promot-
ing scholarship inside the fraterni-
ties. Many houses await the publi-
cation of fraternity academic stand-
ings almost laughingly. It would
seem almost as if fraternities worry
about their members’ grades only tor
the first semester of their freshman
year

Whether the reason for deactivat-
ing is financial or otherwise, an in-
creased spirit of brotherhood would

These factions war against them-
selves and sometimes go so far as to
try to drive the other factions out of
the house. In some cases in the past
this has led to mass deactivations.

Ex-fraternity men also mention a
lack of companionship with under-
classmen as a reason for deactivat-
ing. They don't find themselves as
friendly with underclassmen as they
do with their former pledge brothers
and the brothers who were in the
house when they came, Thus, when
the older brothers have graduated or
deactivated and their classmates be-
gin deactivating, upperclassmen find
little to tie them to their fraternities.
Sometimes this leads to a chain re-
action of deactivations in which a
whole class will quit.

Perhaps one of the saddest of all
remarks came from one such sen-
ior, a student of fairly prominent
stature at W&L: “I guess I stayed in
so long because I felt like I had
some kind of obligation to the fra-
ternity, as if I'd be running out on
it. But I'm really glad 1 quit. I'm
kicking myself that I didn’t do it
sooner”,

It’s true that these views are mi-
nority views, They are those of only
a quarter of the senior class that has
chosen to go independent. Yet that
quarter represents a great deal of
income to fraternities, With the new
Student Center and the fact that
scholarship students will soon be al-
lowed cars and possibly freshmen,
too, this number can only get bigger.
It will be imperative in the years
ahead for fraternities to take a firm-
er hold on their seniors. To do
otherwise would be courting disaster.

cut down that number. In the case of
those members who find a fraternity
is not worth the money it costs,
brotherhood would lend a non-ma-
terial aspect to fraternities which is
sorely lacking. But how to instill
brotherhood in those cases where
little or none exists is an apt ques-
hon,

As any fraternity president will
admit, the sophomore year when an
entire class is living in the frater-
nities together is the year of strong-
est brotherhood. Once members
move into apartments they once
again become fragmented. The solu-
tion then must be to keep them liv-
ing in the houses, This of course,
means drastically reducing the size
of fraternities in that the houses are
too small to accomodate their total
present membership. A reduction in
size however, would also be more
conducive to promoting brother-
hood. It might at this time be point-
ed out that fraternity revenues would
be cut by a size reduction, This
could be offset by eliminating the
dining function of fraternities and
turning it over to the University,
The advantages of such a move are
twofold, First, because feeding mem-
bers is essentially a debt operation of
fraternities, eliminating meals would
both allow a smaller size and in-
crease fraternities’ solvency, Sec-
ondly, the serving of meals by the
University would increase inter-fra-
lernity contact, thus allowing a clos-
er union of the student body,

This is but one possible solution
to the problems of the fraternities,
there are probably many others.
But fraternities cannot waste time
by ignoring the problem. The finan-
cial difficulties of a few houses may
someday be the problems of ail
WAL houses. It is now time for fra-
ternities to take some constructive
action lo prevent membership losses

Southwestern stunned

By Mike Berry

The weather wasn’t great last
weekend and the sun only came out
during the National Anthem, but
that five minutes of sunshine was
all the Generals needed as they lick-
ed the Southwestern Lynx 24-19.

Coach Leslie took advantage of
what weather conditions there were
and kept the gusty November wind
at the Generals’ back during the first
and third quarters. This proved to
be a definite asset all afternoon, It
was a passing game and all the Gen-
eral scores came with the wind at
their back. The first score came
about midway through the first quar-
ter when soccer-style placekicker
Jack Baizley blasted a forty-one yard
field goal through the uprights.

Minutes later defensive halfback
Dave Brooks picked off a Southwes-
tern sideline pass and sauntered into
the end zone untouched. The Lynx
had the wind at their backs for the
second quarter and also took ad-
vantage of it. They managed to score
on a long-bomb and went in at half-
time trailing 10-6,

The Generals came out in the
third quarter and began to march
with the wind advantage. Chuck
Kuhn connected with flanker Bruce
Green who made a one-handed grab
and outran the defenders to the end
zone. Later in the same quarter,
Green pulled in his second scoring
grab to end the Generals’ scoring.

In the final quarter, things began

to slow up for the Generals. The
momentum, except at times, went to
the Lynx of Southwestern. They had
managed to score again in the third
quarter, but as in the first score they
had missed the extra point. They
drove in for the third score midway
through the fourth quarter. The last
time they took possession of the ball
was a “do or die” effort. They al-
most did, but a stubborn General de-
fense managed to keep Southwestern
out of their end zone. The game
ended up with the Generals running
out the clock and the referees break-
ing up a free-for-all.

The game was a passing affair as
Southwestern rolled up 265 yards
and W&L amassed 150 _ yards
through the airways. Chuck Kuhn
was fourteen for twenty-eight for
150 yards and found himself leading
the CAC in the total offense race.

Very bright basketball outlook in
1969 attributed to additional depth

December will commence the key
season in recent years for the bas-
ketball team. The best team since de-
subsidizing will take on the most
strenous campaign since that time.

The opponents this winter include
Navy once again along with a few
new faces. Milligan, Mars Hill and
Rollins each offer new competition
to the Generals. Over the Christmas
break the Washington and Lee Tour-
nament will see the Generals battle
three rivals in an attempt to main-
tain possession of the first place
trophy. Scheduled to play in the
tournament are Centre, Wofford and
Dickinson. A_ great majority of
WA&L’s opponents this year will be
contending with major university
foes, therefore the schedule must be
classified as very tough.

Nevertheless Washington and Lee
has a team extremely capable of
handling the situation. In the previ-
ous season W&L won the small col-
lege championship for Virginia, post-
ing 19 wins, came in second in the
C.A.C. and stunned Navy their first
major college competition in a de-
cade. Mel Cartwright and Mike
Neer each made all-conference and
all-state. The starting five are back
as well as promising freshmen and
an exciting sophomore transfer, Ellie
Gutshall, from East Carolina, Bill
Rhyne is playing again this semester
and along with him are some talent-
ed sophomores highlighted by Mike
Daniel. For once in quite a while
WAL can boast of 10 strong ball
players which means plenty of depth.

To get ready for the campaign
Coach Canfield has prescribed the
hardest workouts during his career
here. Yet, the results have been
gratifying as each boy has worked
just that much harder each practice,
knowing that this year is THE year.

A very sound offense and defense
can be counted on in Doremus Gym
this year. Five offenses with innum-
erable variations are the nucleus of
the Generals’ attack strategy. Over
the summer films have been pain-
stakingly studied to make last year’s
versatile offense even more effective.
With added depth a running type of
offense looms as an even more ex-
plosive threat.

As to defense anyone at Washing-
ton and Lee can tell you that nobody
out-defenses the Generals. Last year
brought national ranking in defense
to Coach Canfield’s crew once again.
But stand forewarned of even better
things. Added manpower enables the
use of more pressing type of de-
fenses as well as the use of the suc-
cess proven match-up defense.

This year some definite goals have
been decided on by the members of
the basketball program. Each player
has his own personal goals of what
he knows he is capable of and must
do, But for the team foremost is the
desire to re-gain the C.A.C. cham-
pionship. In addition the Generals
will strive to uphold their reputation
as one of the best large or small
teams in Virginia. Hopes are also
high that the basketball squad can
continue to be nationally ranked in
defense and scoring margins.

Scrimmages were fought out on
both Friday and Saturday nights
against a very tall and talented Fair-
mont State. The first night Wash-
ington and Lee downed the visitors

Blue booters go to NCAA

Great news from the Athletic De-
partment! Monday morning a phone
call announced that the W&L soccer
team was selected to represent dis-
trict 3 at the Eastern Regional NC-
AA College Play-offs. The first game
will be against Springfield College
on November 14. This play-off is
the best tournament possible for the
Generals to get invited to in soccer.
There is no national champion at
the college level so the eastern
championship is an honor worth
working for.

Springfield College which hosts
the event is a perennial powerhouse
and competed last fall. This year
their record is 11-1-1 losing only
to Dartmouth. Elizabethtown Col-
lege of New Jersey was also extend-
ed an invitation. A fine record of
8-2-2 won them a berth. Rounding
out the competitors is St. Joseph’s
from Philadelphia with a 7-3-1 rec-
ord.

It is the second time in Lyles’
tenure as coach that Washington and
Lee made the NCAA play-offs. In
1964 the blue boosters came in sec-
ond to Coast Guard,

The precious invitation can be
credited to several factors. The first
of these is an excellent defense
which is led by fullbacks Sayers,
Price, and Clarke. This trio teamed
up with goalie Newman have shut
the door on opponents surrendering
only one goal per game. Spectacular
games against tough competition
like Virginia and Roanoke aided

W&L sponsors Va. state meet

By Tom Rowe

For the second time in as many
weeks, Washington and Lee was in-
volved in a multi-team cross-country
meet in which an opponent literally
ran away with a victory, The occa-
sion was the Virginia state meet,
held, ironically, at Washington and
Lee November 7 on a newly-mapped
five-mile course. William and Mary
romped to an overwhelming victory.
An Indian official, claimed that 1969
was the eighth straight year that Wil-
liam and Mary had won the state
meet. W&L placed ninth this year.

The Indians did it with depth. At
the outset, there were 96 runners
from twelve schools. At the end,
William and Mary runners had plac-
ed first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,
tenth and eleventh, and by then, the
scoring had stopped, and mercifully,
their other finishes need not be
enumerated. Point total for W&M
was 23, Finishing first, and thereby
receiving the largest of the copper-
colored shoe-trophies that went to

the first twelve runners to place (sec-
ond twelve received medallions),
was the Tribe’s Howell Michael,
whose 26:02.7 will stand for at least
ten months (till next season) as the
course record.

Virginia Tech put up a_ brave
front with runners second and third,
but the Indian onslaught proved
Tech bravado to be a facade, and
lech finished a distant second with
55 points. Eastern Mennonite’s Elton
Horst, a pre-meet co-favorite, finish-
ed a highly respectable eighth (worth
a trophy), but EMC wound up last
because none of its other runners
placed at all.

Washington and Lee, at 240, de-
feated Virginia Union, Old Domi-
nion, and Eastern Mennonite. Bill
Wilkinson, Dave Haydu, and Bob
Sherwood finished in that order for
the Generals. In this type of meet,
scoring is complicated. For scoring
purposes, certain lower finishers are
eliminated; some runners are dis-
qualified.

Washington and Lee in its effort to
get the nod.

rhis season has been somewhat a
surprise success. After losing great
players like Thom Mitchell and
Scott Fechnay through graduation
the outlook was dismal. The bench
this campaign has been very green
with four freshmen starting. Des-
pite their lack of experience the
youngsters really came through and
pleasantly surprised everyone,

Only a single regular match re-
mains unplayed. Randolph-Macon
brings its two stars Robertson and

year and will provide plenty of trou-
ble for W&L this afternoon.

Both Cartwright and Gutshall starr-

fine overall hustle accounted for
several heads up plays. Surprisingly
enough each team seemed superbly
coached for this early in the year.

but the offenses of each team de-

LETTERS TO

(Continued from Page 2)

supposedly did not investigate the
spirit of the letter, Since the letter
was all I had, | went over it several
times and have gone over it again
before writing this one. | may have
misinterpreted the spirit in which
it was given, but I did not ignore it.
So let’s return to the senior Shirk’s
letter and examine it again line by
line.

“L always thought that Washing-
ton and Lee men had the courage to
be different.” To this I replied that
we did, we have the couarge not
only to be different from other
schools, but also from each other.

“The courage of self-enforcement
of an honor system, the courtesy of
saying ‘hello’ on campus, the dignity
of dressing even when I attended
Washington and Lee before World
War IL.” This, I concede.

“Those who did not like these in-
stitutions did not attend Washington
and Lee.” Maybe so, but I doubt it.
Some may have valued an education
enough to put up with customs they
may not have agreed with. I cer-
tainly do not think dress standards
are adequate criteria for selecting a
college.

“Sometimes we were chided by
our peers for involving ourselves in
a system such as this, Nevertheless,
we did not bow to the pressures of
conformity evidenced by either pro-
test or lack of interest.” Probably
not, it was a different kind of con-
formity he bowed to, for one can-
not deny the conformity was there,
if life was as he described it.

“I sincerely hope that Washington
and Lee men will continue to be
different, will re-establish the values
that can be found in these customs,
and will begin to try to sell their
fellow-students on the values of
these customs.” I, for one, would
like to know what these values are,

THE EDITOR

or, at least, what the senior Shirk
thinks they are. I am sorry, but I
must disagree with Ken Shirk’s opi-
nion that his father is not advocat-
ing return to the old system. To me,
that is all he is doing. The bulk of
the meaning does not seem to me to
be found in the last two lines, but
rather in the whole letter. It is quite
obvious that by rediscovering the
values of customs, he means restor-
ing the past.

If what he is advocating is dis-
cussion of old values, with the pos-
sible acceptance or rejection of these
values, then I agree with him totally.
But I do think there are more im-
portant things which make W&L
stand out other than the clothes its
students wear and “hello.”

Obviously, neither Shirk will agree
with what I have said in totality,
but I do hope this will give a clearer
picture of what I meant. I wish to
emphasize that at no time was it my
intention to ridicule any person, I
certainly hope this will end discus-
sion on the way in which I originally
presented my views, that is, in cheap
phrases. I surely hope that discussion
will now center around the customs,
rather than the letters about them.
