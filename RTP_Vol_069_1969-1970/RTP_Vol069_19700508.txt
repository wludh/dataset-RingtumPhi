Faculty Permits Student Absenteeism

In a special meeting last night the
W&L faculty passed a resolution
which allows students, who feel
morally obligated, to absent them-
selves for the remainder of this se-
mester.

Under the faculty’s resolution de-

Text Of Resolution Before

(Editor’s Note: The following is the

text of a referendum resolution

drawn up by the ad hoc committee
which met in the University Center

Cockpit last night. Its content will

be put to a vote at 1:00 this after-

noon in the special student body
meeting in the front of Lee Chapel.)

Whereas: We the students of Wash-
ington and Lee desire to express
our concern over the present war
in Indochina, we intend to ex-
press this concern by joining with
our fellow students in this country
by closing Washington and Lee as
of May 11, 1970.

Through whatever channels the fac-
ulty deems necessary and with all
possible haste we urge that the
following be implemented:

1. Declare all classes cancelled
retroactive to May 6, until the
fall of 1970 and direct the univer-
sity towards the crisis in this
country.

2. As a substitute for classes, stu-
dents, teachers, and others inter-
ested will use the facilities of the
university to conduct seminars

and hold discussions open to
everyone on the economic, politi-
cal, philosophical, sociological,
etc., ramifications of the Indo-
china War.

In addition, it is hoped that the
educational experiences can aid in
exploring other problems — pre-
sent and potential — facing our
society and our world.

Whereas classes will have ended as
of May 11, 1970, it will be up to
the individual student to arrange
for grades on the following basis:
A student may opt for other (1)
grades in his present p/f and letter
combination or (2) all pass/fail
on work completed as of May 6,
1970.

Graduating seniors will not be
deemed to have completed their
requirements for graduation until
June 5, 1970.

Given the unique situation of the
law school and American Bar As-
sociation requirements, the stu-
dents of the law school may take
action they deem necessary to
meet their requirements.

graduate with their class and receive
their diplomas.

Any student can make arrange-
ments with his professor to take his
exams at any time until September
30.

A student can absent himself by
writing a letter stating his reasons
for temporary withdrawal to the
Faculty Executive Committee. Im-
mediately on receipt of that letter
by the Faculty EC, a student is con-
sidered to be absent.

This resolution stemmed from the
one adopted by the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee prior to the student
meeting in the University Center
yesterday afternoon.

In passing this resolution the fac-
ulty recognized the “sense of im-

mediate concern they (the students)
feel about major national issues.”
The faculty resolution also stated
that a student still will be considered
as enrolled at W&L under the ap-
proved program. For those students
who choose to stay on campus, the
faculty endorsed a program whereby
students will be able to study the
present national situation.

The resolution also noted that
“notwithstanding the depth of this
feeling of some students, the fac-
ulty does not believe that Washing-
ton and Lee classes should be sus-
pended or its educational respon-
sibility be abandoned.”

The resolution was a result of
three hours of deliberation by the
faculty and takes effect immediately.

C ockpit Meetin g Proposes
Referendum For Students

In order for students on this
campus who feel a moral obligation
to do “something in the real world,”
an interested group of 75 students
and faculty gathered in the Univer-

Student Body

Another Side

(Editor’s Note: The Ring-tum Phi
offers this statement as an expres-
sion of an opposing view drafted by
a group of students which form the
“Committee To Keep The Univer-
sity Community Together.”)

Take a deep breath and count to
ten.

The radicals decided not to give
you until Monday to think over the
probable consequences of closing
down the University. Just stop a
minute and think.

Closing Washington and Lee for
a month is not like closing an ele-
mentary school three days for snow.

The faculty resolution allows
those who feel more immediate con-
cerns to postpone their school work.
The proposed student body, action,
is a cop-out. We cannot declare
Washington and Lee education ir-
relevant and simulanteously expect
the rest of the world to continue to
take it seriously.

isty Center Cockpit Thursday after-
noon to discuss the possibility of
the University’s allowing students to
leave school for the rest of this
semester.

“The purpose of this ad hoc com-
mittee,” said Fran Lawrence, presi-
dent-elect of the student body, “is
to have an open discussion about
what we want the faculty to do
about suspension of classes.”

Staman Ogilvie, junior EC mem-
ber, informed the group that the
faculty Executive Committee was in
session at the time, and had called
a special meeting of the faculty,
which was held last night.

At 6 p.m. the meeting in the
Cockpit reconvened with senior
Gates Shaw in charge. The principal
business of the meeting was the
drafting of a resolution, which ap-
pears elsewhere on this page.

The resolution was passed by the
students assembled at the Cockpit
and will be presented to the student
body at large at 1:00 this afternoon.

A proposal by senior Paul Mor-
row expressing concern over the
plight of students wishing to con-
tinue their classes was defeated.

Another motion to present the
Faculty with the proposal soon after
it was drafted last night was also de
feated following Shaw's remark
that “we don’t want to inundate the
faculty with demands which don't
even come from the student body as
a whole.”
