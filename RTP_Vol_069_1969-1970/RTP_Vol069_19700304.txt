Washington and Lee’s Generals brought home their third
College Athletic Conference basketball championship in the
last four years by defeating Centre College 93-66, and Wash-
ington University, 82-69, in St. Louis last weekend.

Stu Fauber was nothing short of tremendous against the
Prayin’s Colonels, who had reached the semi-finals by defeat-

ing Sewanee in a first-round game.
The Lynchburg senior scored 21
points, his season high, while
grabbing 11 rebounds and tallying
5 assists.

Aiding in the conquest was the
“Bandit Squad” of Paul McClure,
Dave Stone, and John Glace, who
teamed with Fauber and Mike
Daniel when Mike Neer and Mel
Cartwright were forced to the side-
lines with foul trouble. Neer foul-
ed out after scoring 10 points and
Cartwright rode the bench after
collecting four fouls and 16 points.

The squad’s wish, expressed by
Coach Verne Canfield, to avenge last
season’s loss at the hands of South-
western was not to be realized. Wash-
ington University, the home team,
defeated the Lynx and won. the
right to face W&L in the final.

The General's 82-69 championship
victory was one of the year’s finest
all-around team performances. W&L
dominated play from the start and
had a 38-18 lead over the cold-
shooting, out-rebounded Bears.

Wrestlers End
Dismal Season
On Happy Note

WA&L’s wrestling team capped off
a disappointing 1-10 season with a
respectable showing in the CAC
tournament that contributed to the
school’s impressive appearance there.
Coach Dick Miller's squad placed
third of the five teams participating.

Individually, they did even better.
Dee Copenhaver came in first in
the 190 Ib. weight class, Razz Ras-
berry and Wade Gowl finished sec-
ond in the 134 and 127 Ib. classes
respectively, and Bill West was third
in the 145 Ib. division.

Bruce Hankins (5-3) and Captain
Dave Higgins (5-5) had the team’s
top records for the season. Hankins
and Copenhaver have been named
captains for next year.

Higgins, in commenting on pros-
pects for next year, noted that the
new team would face the same dif-
ficulties this year’s squad suffered.
Higgins cited lack of depth and ex-
perience as the critical problems
future teams will have to overcome.

Washington, running a full-court
man to man press and sparked by
the shooting of Bruce Holloway and
Paul Dodge, narrowed the lead
throughout the second half, closing
at One point to 66-60. A final W&L
spurt, coupled with some Washing-
ton turnovers, upped the margin to
the final thirteen points.

Cartwright and Neer controlled
the boards, while Mike Daniel play-
ed outstanding defensive ball and
added some fast-break baskets.
“Magic Mel” canned 22 points and
grabbed 17 rebounds, while hitting
on 10 of his 11 free throws, Neer
put in 17 points and collected 20
rebounds,

The finalists provided four of the
five all-tournament players. Cart-
wright, who was voted the competi-
tion’s Most Valuable Player, and
Neer joined Washington’s Holloway
and Dodge, and Buddy Baker of
fourth place Centre to form the
CAC “dream team.”

The CAC tournament triumph
capped off an 18-7 year for the
Generals. It also marked the finale
for the squad’s quartet of seniors—
Cartwright, Neer, Fauber, and Cap-
tain Norwood Morrison. The four
finished their college careers with
a record of 76-23, one of the best
showings in the University’s history.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

  

By TOM GAGE

Over at the Homestead in Hot
Springs, among the many pasttimes
that one can pursue is skiing. It is
kind of a minislope they’ve got over
there, especially if you're used to
something else, but it’s quite a lot
of fun all the same. I decided to
go up there last Saturday with a
group of friends and proceeded to
make the necessary arrangements.
Skis had to be rented . . . boots,
poles and all that. So a phone call
was made Friday afternoon by yours
truly to reserve the stuff for the
next day.

“Good
stead.”

“Hello, connect me with the ski
area, please.” . . . (pause-dial-pause)
then a huge “ALLO”... . . (Gulp).

“I'd like to rent some equipment
for tomorrow.”

“Ve vill have lots of boots und
skis.” . . . CLICK. That was that.
My thank you fell on deaf ears.

The next day produced an un-
forgetable experience. The rope tow
there is one of the slowest and
safest ever seen, yet it still took
its unfortunate toll. Some poor
wretch had let go of the rope and
started sliding backwards down the
hill. There were screams of “Grab
her” and “Look out below” but
nothing seemed to work as she

afternoon, the Home-

slowly careened into two kids and
a middle-aged man. This snowball-
ing mass finally stopped halfway
down the hill and just toppled over.
Nobody was

hurt, but what a

weird scene!

So I went over to the intermediate
hill while the untangling process was
in effect, but matters did not im-
prove. I had just started my
awkward descent when one lone ski
went whistling past me. Twenty feet
behind lay a crumpled figure that
was emitting the strangest combina-
tion of laughs and grunts. The ski
patrol was already on the way so
I decided to wait at the bottom of
the hill to see if the guy was really
hurt. Well you could tell that the
patrol was making sort of a make-
shift splint for the guy, so the in-
jury had to be rather serious.
Finally they loaded him onto the
stretcher and started to bring him
down the hill. Of course the crowd
was silent, very solemn. Then sud-
denly, “the draft. | won't have to
go in the draft!” The afflicted him-
self was breaking the silence was
enraptured screams while at the
same time flashing the peace sign at

the amazed onlookers . . . which
included me.
“Grab your camera, Doris,”

some girl said to her friend who
was standing next to me. “We can’t
miss this!” At last glance these two
girls were dancing around the fallen
skier, taking his picture which seem-
ed to please the poor idiot no end.

Well I took the guy's advice about
peace, retired to the confiines of
the lodge and poured myself a glass
of Germany's finest. And, you know,
there was not anything weird about
it at all! A first for the day.

Awards To Be Given

The Washington and Lee English
Department will sponsor a series
of Mahan Awards in Creative Writ-
ing again this year.

Awards will be offered in both
prose and verse. Two awards will
be offered in freshman prose, and
one prose award will be presented
to a sophomore and one to a junior.

Prose entries should be intenpre-
tive or imaginative; short stories,
critical studies, one-act or longer
plays or informal essays. A mini-
mum of 1500 words is required and
an adequate bibliography and foot-
notes should accompany criticism.

One verse award will be present-
ed. This competition is open to men
from any class except seniors. A
minimum of 30 lines is required.

Entries must be typewritten and
submitted to the secretary of the
English Department in Payne 32 A
by noon April 13.

Minority

Each entry should be provided
with a title page including the title
of the paper, a pen name chosen
by the writer, the writer's class, and
a pledge signed with the writer's
pen name. A sealed envelope, con-
taining the writer's pen name on
the outside and his real name on
the inside must also be submitted.

A three-man committee from the
English Department will judge the
competition and announce its de-
cision in early May. No awards will
be made in any class unless the
entries meet the competition's stand-
ards. No student may win both a
prose and a verse award in the
same year.

The Mahan awards consist of a
$100 exemption from college fees
during the year following the one in
which the award is made or, if the
recipient chooses, $60 in cash.

Student Recruitment

lars at 4 per cent per annum. There-
in lies a problem. However, outside

sources of aid are suggested as
alternatives.
The final matter to which the

report turns its attention is assimila-
tion. The committee proposes that
both a summer program and an
extra transitional year be devised to
aid in assimilation. “Such a pro-
gram would be a necessary corollary
to a policy of conditional acceptance
(i.e., where CBEB scores are over-
looked). The focus of this program
would be on basic skills, This pro-
gram would be intended for those

allowed to stay are now almost
non-existant. The new regulations
institute an optional system in which
if a girls chooses, she may leave
record of her destination and the
place where she will stay in a
sealed envelope in the student activi-
ties office. Such a system insures
that parents or urgent callers would
be able to contact her while guaran-
teeing her right to privacy.

Proposals for a revision of parietal
restrictions are now in committee,
but have yet to reach the Senate
floor. Liquor in the dorms has yet
to become a salient topic, accord-
ing to Hollins Dean of Students
Bayliss Wiley.

The new curfew regulations are
similar to those now in effect at
Randolph-Macon Women's College
and Sweet Briar College. Randolph.
Macon hasn't had curfew regulations
since September, while a similar plan
went into effect at Sweet Briar in
October. At present Hollins is the
only neighboring women's college

students who are somehow deficient
in admissions criteria.” Unfortun-
ately the report does not detail why
such students would be abnormally
deficient if they would not lower
WAL’s admissions standards to be-
gin with. Presumably, the CEEB
scores would be low only because
of the cultural backgrounds of the
underprivileged. If high school
grades are to remain a primary fac-
tor in admissions for the under-
privileged, it is difficult to see why
deficient students would be accepted
unless the University lowered its
standards.

The proposed summer session
would emphasize English and math
and would be taught by two faculty
members from each of those de-
partments. Despite the committee's
detail in outlining such a summer
program, no mention is made as to
how it would be financed.

The transitional year would be
one in which underprivileged stu-
dents could experiment with college
courses. It would be aimed at im-
proving their preparation for col-
lege. “The students (would) attend
regular classes and receive course
credit if a passing grade (were) at-
tained, Failure in a course (would)
result in the non-registration of
credit rather than a failing grade
which (would) endanger his stand-
ing. After the first year transitional
students (would) be subject to the
normal course requirements.” In
order to enable transitional students
to graduate with their class (they
would probably not have full course
loads their first year, and would
rarely be allowed overloads) the de-
gree requirements for them would
be lowered from 123 to 117 credits

Problems of Fraternity Contact

(Continued from Page 1)
allow the physical presence of any
fraternity-affiliated upperclassmen in
the dormitories, except dormitory
counselors, (it does allow dorm
couselors to rush as much as they
desire in the dorms) and it pro-
hibits a fraternity man from talking
to a freshman in McCormick Li-
brary—but not a freshman from
talking to a fraternity man. These
two sanctuaries were seemingly pro-
vided as a refuge for the freshman
from the onslaught of upperclass-
men,

It is the fraternities that will be
forced to bear most of the burdens
of this plan. A fraternity house is
open to freshmen 24 hours a day.
There is no sanctuary for the fra-
ternity man. The fraternities,
as a whole, will be forced by
competitive pressures to equal or
counteract the maneuvers of the
most aggressive, high-spending fra-
ternity; there is no prohibition
against free liquor except on Fri-
day evenings; there is the potential
for combo-escalation as each fra-
ternity seeks to attract the best
freshmen to its parties; there are
no restrictions on a freshman eating
dinner at any house. Each fraternity
will probably seek to maintain
daily, positive contact with the fresh-
men that they are rushing or risk
losing them.

The IFC must again attempt to
create a balanced deferred rush pro-
gram that combines the seemingly
incompatible objectives of (1) pro-
tecting the fraternity system, (2)
maximizing the communication be-
tween the freshmen and the fra-
ternities and (3) not interfering
with the academic interests of the
community,

Firm to Study
Parking Issue

A landscape and architectural firm
from Pittsburgh, Pa., has been re-
tained by Washington and Lee Uni-
versity to study the school’s parking
problem.

Assistant to the President Frank
A. Parsons announced Monday that
the firm of Griswold, Winters, and
Swain has been employed as con-
sultants for the planning of ex-
panded parking facilities on campus.

The conypany has been requested
to provide recommendations for the
relief of student parking problems
by next September, plans for “stor-
age” parking for 1970-71 freshmen
cars, and proposals for parking
facilities behind the addition to
Doremus Gymnasium.

Government Can Deflate Left

(Continued from Page 3)

mission also recommended that the
voting age be lowered to 18.

If adopted, the commission recom-
mendations would not totally end
student revolt — nothing would
please the SDS— but they would
go a long way toward easing stu-
dent unrest.

The end of the draft would eli-
minate the uncertainty which now
fogs the students’ future. The most
significant aspect of the recom-
mendation is that the draft would
end next year, and not when we
get out of Vietnam, if we ever get
out. And the lowering of the vot-
ing age to 18 would give college
age students a voice in determining
national policy. Most 18-year olds,
although they can be drafted, feel
that they have no voice in their
own destiny.

The elimination of the draft would
also eliminate from campuses many
of the malcontents who stir up dis-
order. Some students have no in-
terest in a college education, but
enroll to get the four year de-
frement. Once in college, they be-
come professional agitators, rather
than seeking a degree.

President Nixon endorses both
commission recommendations as a
means of winning the confidence of
young Americans. Governor Holton
goes even further in recommending
that students share in the administra-

tion of colleges. Last week, the
Governor appointed a law student
to the University of Virginia Board
of Visitors. Unfortunately, Secretary
of Defense Melvin Laird has thrown

some cold water on the commis-
sion recommendations by saying
that 1971 would be too early to

establish an all-volunteer army.

It might be true, as San Fran-
cisco State President S. 1. Hayakawa
stated, that only one per cent of
the nation’s college students are
involved in campus violence. But
a much larger segment shares the
feeling of anxiety. Congress should
make law the commission recom-
mendations in order to maintain
education as the main product of
America’s colleges.
