PHYSICS LECTURER

Will speak with students
and confer with faculty

Professor William C. Davidon,
Chairman of the Department of
Physics at Haverford College, Hav-
erford, Pa. will serve as a visiting
lecturer at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity and Virginia Military Insti-
tute, Thursday and Friday, Febru-
ary 19 and 20,

He will visit under the auspices
of the American Association of
Physics Teachers and the American
Institute of Physics as part of a
broad, nationwide program to stimu-
late interest in physics. The pro-
gram is now in its thirteenth year
and is supported by the National
Science Foundation.

Lectures, informal discussion, as-
sistance to faculty members concern-
ing curriculum and research prob-
lems in physics, and talks with stu-
dents will feature Professor
Davidon’s visit. Professor Edward
F. Turner, Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Physics at Washington and
Lee University and Professor Philip
Peters of the Department of Physics
at Virginia Military Institute are in
charge of arrangements for Profes-
sor Davidon’s visits.

William C. Davidon, professor of
physics at Haverford College, Hav-
erford, Pennsylvania, and chairman
of the department, is a graduate of
the University of Chicago, where he
received his B.S. (1947), M.S. (1950),
and Ph.D. degrees (1954). He also
attended Purdue University.

Prior to joining the Haverford
faculty in 1961, he was employed as
an associate physicist at the Argonne
National Laboratories for five years.
Earlier he was research director of
the Nuclear Instrument and Chemi-
cal Corporation, Chicago.

He also has served as a research
associate at the Fermi Institute for
Nuclear Studies at the University of
Chicago and as a visiting associate
professor at the University of Wash-
ington.

Awarded a Fulbright Grant in
1966 Dr. Davidon spent two semest-
ers at the University of Arrhus in
Denmark. He examined scattering
theory in quantum mechanics—ex-
ploring the consequences of De-
Sitter symmetry—and worked to
improve computer methods for
locating the minimum of a fune-
tion.

Dr. Davidon’s areas of research
have also included the theory of
clementary particles, experiments on
meson scattering, foundations of
quantum mechanics and mathemati-
cal logic. He is the author of more
than 25 technical articles and is
working on a physics textbook. He
also holds several patents on de-
vices for measuring radioactivity,

Cahn, Matthews, Leonard
will study deferred rush

Chuck Cahn announced at last
night's IFC meeting that those
houses with tentative parietal plans
would have to come up with new
plans when they elected new officers;
the tentative plans were approved
with the provision that new plans
be submitted when new officers
were elected.

Larry Honig, Chairman of Con-
tect, stated that there would be no
further student assessments for
Contact's use. He said that the logic
behind this was that the student
body should not pay for an activity
of the IFC.

President Cahn announced that
there had been a committee formed
to study the prospects of deferred
rush next year, consisting of him-
self, Jim Matthews, and Danny
Leonard. He stated that sugges-
tions from the various houses would
be welcome. Their proposal will be
discussed before the IFC upon its
completion, which should be in
about three weeks.

Andrew Wyndham, in charge of
the Heart Fund Drive, announced
there would be a meeting of fra-
ternity representatives in the meet-
ing room of the Student Center at
seven Wednesday evening. The house
whose members collect the most will
be given a free keg.

Dean John, who was unable to
attend the meeting, sent a note to
the IFC. He stated that because
of the parking problem caused by
the construction on the new gym-
nasium, students living close to
school were requested to walk to
school. He suggested that those
fraternities who were allowed to
drive their rushees to their houses
the first two days of rush to be the
only ones to drive to school.

There was a general discussion
concerning the activities of the last
weekend of school, as there is to be
no Finals Weekend. There is a pos-
sibility that there could be a cock-
tail party and combo, financed by
fraternity funds.

proposals presented to faculty

By ROY CARLTON
and STEVE ORY

A major project of this year's
Executive Committee reached _ its
terminal stages last night as the Stu-
dent Affairs and Faculty Regula-
tions Committee presented their re-
port to the EC. In other preliminary
matters the EC turned its attention
to the recently intensified parking
problems of the campus, discussed
a proposed University Assembly on
drugs and considered an upcoming
Co-ed Week to be held at a nearby
women’s college.

The construction of a new gym-
nasium complex, which is to begin
this Wednesday, has caused a severe
traffic problem on campus. Where
parking was scarce before, it is now
practically non-existing. Yesterday
the University issued a plea to all
students within walking distance not
to drive their cars to campus. In
line with this thought, Dean Kum-
puris, Senior Representative, recom-
mended that members of fraterni-
ties within walking distance of the
school be asked to leave their cars
in the fraternity parking lots. The
motion was passed unanimously and
was forwarded to the faculty for
their consideration.

Further discussion was held on
the suggestion proferred by Law
representative John Markham con-
cerning an assembly on drugs. Last
week Markham had mentioned the
possibility of having a mandatory
University Assembly on drug use.
He is now certain that the Presi-
dent of the Virginia Druggists As-
sociation can be obtained as a
speaker. A program is now in the
process of being scheduled and
further plans will be announced.

Student Body President Swede
Henberg announced that Randolph-
Macon Woman's College is planning
a Co-ed Week upon the model pro-
vided by Washington and Lee. Sev-
eral area men’s colleges, including
WAL, have been invited to send
students, Participants will attend
classes at Randolph-Macon for a
week with housing being provided.

‘Earth Day’ group meets
to initiate spring Teach-in

Washington and Lee's own “Earth
Day” Environmental Action group
will hold its first meeting Wednes-
day Night, 7:00 p.m. in the Main
meeting room of the Student Cen-
ter.

This “Earth Day” committee has
been formed by interested students
from WAL and several of the sur-
rounding girls’ schools. lt plans to
align itself with the National April
22 “Environmental Teach-In.”

April 22 is “Earth Day,” a day

Smith picked as
top speaker in

debate tourney

Charles Smith, a senior from
Louisville, Kentucky, won the Best
Speaker Award at King's College in
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania while
competing in a debate tournament
over the weekend, Over the course
of the weekend Smith faced fifty-nine
other debaters, representing over
twenty colleges, Smith and junior
Bill Radigan of Arlington, Virginia
teamed up to win six of their eight
debates, while Radigan was chosen
as the seventh best speaker. The
Smith-Radigan combination defeat-
ed teams from George Washington
University, the University of Mas
sachusetis, the University of Ver
mont, C.W. Post College, Rutgers
University and Dickinson College,
while losing twice to Emory Uni
versity

While Smith and Radigan were
winning the trophies, John Reynold
and Kenny Murov were debating at
the United States Naval Academy
in Annapolis, Md. The Reynolds
Murov team won five out of eight
debates in the tournament. They
beat the U.S. Military Academy,
Dartmouth University, St. John Uni
versity (Md), Kings College and
Auburn University, while losing to

vities On campuses and local com-
munities, people will have a chance
to examine the facts about the en-
vironmental crisis. They can find
out what, if anything, is being done,
and what must be done.

April 22 is being planned and
organized on the local level, with
local people deciding for themselves
the issues upon which to focus, and
the activities which are most ap-
propriate, Local groups must de-
termine what will happen on April
22, and what comes aftewards.

Here plans are currently being
made for a combined April 22
“Earth Day” with other local schools
attending. The day's program will
present the effects of pollution and
environmental neglect on the popu-
lation, and the legal and economic
recourses we have to solve this
pressing problem.

All students, regardless of politi-
cal persuasion, are urged to atiend
this public organizational meeting

$3 million gym addition
begins, but parking area
vanishes with construction

Washington and Lee University
will see one of its problems—in-
adequate gymnasium facilities
start to melt away Wednesday when
construction will begin on a $3
million addition to Doremus Gym
nasium

For a time, however, the con
struction will lead to complication
of another problem—lack of
quate parking facilities

Beginning Monday morning, the
parking area behind the gymnasium
was barricaded and no parking will
be permitted there, according to D
E. Brady, Ir. superintendent of
building and grounds

Consiruction is expected to take
approximately 18 months

Persons who live within walk.
ing distance of the campus are

Brady said.

“We will he developing idditional

weather permits, he said

At present, Randolph-Macon has
three male students who have been
exchanged through a program with
Colgate University.

The major portion of the Execu-
tive Committee's attention was de-
voted to the report of the Student
Affairs and Faculty Regulations
Committee. The committee was
composed of Senior representative
Dave Bethea, Sophomore represent-
atives Glenn Azuma and Bill An-
drews and was chaired by Swede
Henberg. They presented a nine
page report reviewing faculty regula-
tions concerning  student-faculty
relationships.

The review of faculty regulations
was thought to be necessary in that
they have not been reviewed by
any body, student, faculty or ad-
ministrative, in the last twelve years.
The report proposed several reforms
in a variety of faculty committees
as well as suggesting changes in
regulations applying to students.

The validity of the concept of
“in loco parentis” was attacked and
it was proposed that its application
be limited in several proposed re-
forms pertaining to class attendance,
limitation on activities and parietals.

The committee made specific
recommendations that the student
body should have a representative
on the faculty Admissions Commit-

 

tee, Courses and Degree Commit-
tee and Executive Committee sub-
ject to certain restraints. It was also
discovered that there is presently a
regulation allowing for a_ student
representative on the faculty Lec-
tures Committee. Although the ap-
pointment of a student representative
has been allowed to lapse over the
years, the EC intends to address
itself to the matter shortly.

In what the EC termed the
recommendation that “touch(es)
most directly upon the character of
student/faculty relationships,” the
EC called for a reconstitution of
the Student Affairs Committee. The
EC proposal would have a ten mem-
ber committee composed of five fac-
ulty and five student members, thus
necessitating cooperation between
both groups.

The EC also turned its attention
to the faculty rules listed under
“Faculty Regulations Governing
Student Behavior.” These deal with
drinking, immorality, gambling, fra-
ternity house parties, fraternity and
dormitory parietals, cuts and limita-
tions on activities of students with
sub-par Grade Point Ratios.

Among the modifications suggest-
ed was that the section “explicitly
forbidding intoxication, immorality
and gambling is a position which

THE RING-TUM PHI VEA survey finds student concern
for new and traditional problems

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Two sets of cobwebs

For an entire semester we patiently watched the spiders
in the Student Center spin webs around the Executive Com-
mitteemen as we waited for them to move. Today there are
a few annoyed spiders.

The report approved last night was thorough, long over-
due and excellent. However, that a comprehensive study of
student affairs and faculty regulations has not been made for
twelve years reflects the languid apathetic nature of our stu;
dent government. It is commendable that this year’s EC has
turned its attention to this most significant area of student in-
volvement, thus lifting itself from the depths of inertia which
should be—but have not been—anathema to such a group.

Perhaps one explanation for the listless mature of our,
student government is the stranglehold of the in loco parentis |

structure of regulations enforced through the SAC. We fully
agree with the EC subcommittee which wrote the report that
such a structure is an obstruction to the free exchange of
ideas on which a university must be based. We earnestly hope
the faculty will cooperate in this re-examination of regula-
tions and committees.

No longer a choice

“Contact” number six has come and gone, but “Con-
tact’s” passing will be regrettéd more than usual this year.
The one hundred twenty women who were a part of the total
life here for a week, are now, like “Contact”, simply part
of our history.

We seriously challenge anyone who can still be opposed
to coeducation for W&L. True, the women were only here
for five short days. But look back at those five days when
coeducation was on trial. The week was marked by pleasant,
orderly, intellectual and rewarding campus activity. But more
important, there was a real and natural atmosphere circulat-
ing throughout the campus which was evident in and out of
the classroom, and which refreshingly replaced the stale
odor of superficiality usually encountered.

We, moreover, did not have to struggle to perceive the
change. A mere stroll into such diverse spots as the tavern
or, say, Howe Hall was all the effort needed. This validated
one of the major points proponents of coeducation have
been arguing. Likewise, the order of the week completely
discredited those who used to claim coeducation would be
disruptive of the academic life of the community. The ex-
periment did not degenerate into a party, as some critics
feared.

The only academic apple-cart that could possibly be
spilled if W&L decides to become a coeducational institu-
tion is that one containing the interesting but slightly off-
color anecdotes used occasionally by professors to spice
lectures. But all of these are by nature subject to removal
or else to polishing or sugar-coating, both of which are
relatively speedy operations.

Another choice argument in the arsenal of opponents
to coeducation is that such a change would destroy our time-
honored traditions. This contention is first of all open to a
question of definition. What traditions still exist? If some can
be yet conjured up, so what if they die? (If they would have
to die at all.) The time has arrived when we must abandon
sentimentality and nostalgic emotions. It may be difficult
to see them go, but they are no longer capable of resisting
hard facts:
® Coeducation will improve the academic life of the Uni-

versity. We currently discriminate by sex in admissions

against some forty per cent of our national college
population.

® The declining trend in our male admission applications
in part is traceable to being non-coeducational.

® A sexually segregated society is unnatural, be it in or
out of the classroom.

® The orderliness of Co-ed Week, early in the semester,
justifies the faith placed in the average student by pro-
ponents of coeducation.

 

* ’
Contacting a friend

A few months ago we published a short editorial solicit-
ing used paperback books for the barren shelves in the
student center library. Fully aware that our hope for student
res would transgress the limits of rationality, we never-
theless tried. We failed totally.

But in the long run our failure allowed success. Mr.
Ted Powers, the Roanoke television personality who twice
visited the campus last week as a guest of the University
in the “Contact” program, has saved the day for our little
cause. When Mr. Powers entered that comfortably fur-
nished room last Wednesday afternoon, he was apparently
impressed by the ugly coldness of the nude mahogany shelves
which gloomily encroach from three sides.

Acting simply and generously as a friend of the Uni-
versity, Mr. Powers turned over his “Contact” honorarium
to Mr. Ken Lane to purchase books to generate at least a
non-hostile atmosphere for the library. Hopefully, this gift
from outside the University will shame some of our native

Shylocks. Thank you, Mr. Powers.

(Editor’s Note: This article is
compiled from data and general
news releases supplied by the Vir-
ginia Education Association. The
allusions to the W&L campus are
editorial.)

@ Virginia students lack heroes,

@ Seventy-eight percent of those

surveyed would like to see mari-

juana laws relaxed.

@ Seventy-eight per cent of Vir-

ginia student leaders would like

more blacks at their college.

@ Forty-one per cent believe

that students on their campus

are becoming more in favor of
student protests.

@ The Vietnam War bothers

students more than any other

present day problem.

These are a few facts stemming
from a Virginia Education Associa-
tion survey of newspaper editors
and student body presidents on all
Virginia campuses.

Not surprisingly, the students sur-
veyed expressed great concern about
the Vietnam War. Sixty-one per cent
said student activists on their campus
have more concern about the war
than any other issue, which cer-
tainly is true at W&L.

Describing their position on the
war, 41 per cent of the students
polled said they were “strongly dov-
ish;” 28 per cent said “mildly dov-
ish.” Only nine per cent considered
themselves “strongly hawkish” while
14 per cent rated themselves “mildly
hawkish.”

A war-related issue which many
student leaders denounced was draft
methods, Many students recom-
mended the lottery system. (This
survey was taken before the lottery
came into being.) Many also recom-
mended abolishing compulsory mili-
tary service and replacing it with a
well-paid volunteer army.

Student advice
on dance plans

sought by Board

By SKIP NOTTBERG

Vice President, Dance Board

In past years numerous prefer-
ential polls have been taken by the
Dance Board to discern the likes
and dislikes of the student body
concerning entertainment. This year.
once again, Dance Board shal!
solicit the opinions of the students,
however, a new factor of import-
ance has entered the scene. There-
fore the Dance Board asks the
especial cooperation of the mem-
bers of the student body.

With the transformation of the
University’s schedule to the 12-12-6
semester system mext year, there
comes a corresponding change in
the calendar of the Dance Board.
Such a transition brings many new
questions which will have to be
considered. Underlying such prob-
lems will be the basic considerations
of the number of concerts which
should be planned and of the type
of emphasis which should be placed
upon them, that of quality or that
of quantity. As future president of
the Dance Board, I feel that the
the most satisfactory solutions will
be resolved only by asking the stu-
dents exactly what they desire in
terms of numbers and types.

The Dance Board exists only for
the students, and therefore it is the
responsibility of the Dance Board to
communicate with the students and
vice versa. During this past year
we have atiempied to yield to stu-
dent demands to the besi of our
ability and resources in the selection
of entertainers. We have brought as
diverse a group of performers as
possible and in addition have im-
proved the sound quality of their
performances through the purchase
of new speakers. We have attempted
to have a8 Many conceris as pos-
sible. this being exemplified beat by
the addition of two extra concerts
in the spring and fall

But, because of the new schedul
ing sysiem which has been initiated,
we afe forced to renew our efforis
to fulfill the needs and desires of
the student body, This effort will be
manifested in a questionnaire which
will be distributed in the Common
and in the fraternity houses. The
comments and responses from this
will serve as a guideline the
Dance Hoard when composing next
years schedule: they will tell us
exactly what type of entertainment
and what amounts our fellow mem
bers of the student body wish

tion and participation of each stu
dent in the furthering and strength

of the COMMUNION Bap
hetween the Dance Hoard and the

student body

Besides the military draft and
war, the students polled expressed
concern about marijuana laws, racial
discrimination, the 18-year-old vote
issue, college paternalism, irrelevant
college courses and poverty.

Concerning racial matters at their
school, 78 per cent of the respond-
ents said they would like to have
more Negro students attend their
college.

Several student leaders complain-
ed that their college’s admission
policies were not conducive to in-
creasing Negro enrollment. There
has been much interest at W&L this
year in increasing Negro enrollment.

Forty-five per cent of the respond-
ents said that racial tensions were
no problem at all on their campus
(W&L would obviously fall into this
category); 30 per cent said they
were not often a problem. Only
three per cent described racial ten-
sions as often being a problem.

Eighty-five per cent felt that col-
leges should offer black history and
culture courses; 81 per cent said
race should be discussed more in
college social studies. The sociology
department here offers two courses
that study these areas. ¢

When asked how students on their
campus feel about student protests,
41 per cent of the respondents said
students are becoming more in favor
of them. This is probably not true
of W&L since the administration/
faculty has in the past been attentive
to student opinion, thus there has
been little need to protest.

(Forty-four per cent said that
question did not apply to their cam-

pus,- reflecting the relatively peace-
ful atmosphere at many Virginia
campuses.)

The students questioned seemed
to agree that most college students
want to promote social discussion
and change. Thirty per cent of the
respondents said students are trying
“a great deal” to do this; 56 per
cent said they are trying “some-
what.” Although the picture may be
changing, W&L probably is in-
cluded in the “somewhat” area.

Almost coming forth as a unified
front, 95 per cent of the college
students surveyed said it is “very
important” to have student repre-
sentation in policy making on their
campus.

Eighty-four per cent said most
students “want more” participation
in making campus policies since it
would make students better able to
understand the problems and aims
of their administrators, and con-
versely the administrators better able
to understand student positions.

Seventy-eight per cent of the
student leaders would like to get
representation on the Board of
Trustes; 60 per cent believe these
student representativs should have
voting powers. Students from
W&L have been invited to sit
with the Board, but in a non-voting
capacity.

One respondent summed up this
sentiment: “Students, not their par-

the college regulations, so they

Student Center featuring combos,
‘Sem night’ as Cockpit activities

By ROY CARLTON

Washingion and Lee's Student
Center the past two weekends has
had a social schedule which would
be the envy of any fraiernity.
Combo parties have been featured
on Saturday nights and according
to the Center's social director, Ken
Lane. the practice will continue for
the rest of the year.

The only weekend in which Lane
does not foresee a pariy in the
Cenier will be Springs weekend,
because “we're not trying to com-
pete with the fraternities.”

The social program has received
iis impetus from the recently passed
Student Center budget. Funds of
$1,000 dollars have been provided
for this years functioning by the
University. Admission is presently
being charged ai the parties to sup
plement the budget.

In addition to the combo parties
the Center is adding a new dimen-
sion to weekday fights with a
planned “Sem nighi.” Beginning
next Tuesday night, beer will be
reduced from 25 cents to 20 cents
4 flass on Tuesday nights. This
is expected to encourage girls from
Southern Seminary to come over
to WAL. A irial run for this idea
was conducted all last week during
Contact. Beer prices were reduced
due to the influx of girls fer Co
ed Week with the effect that the
Cockpit was jammed every night.

The two combo parties in the
Cockpit to date have been very
successful. According to Mr. Lane.
We have a capacity of 150 and
is Been filled both ime” The
bands have been coniracted through
an agent in Roanoke. The first com
bo was the “VIPs.” while the sec
ond lhe lohan
This weekend's sounds will be pre

are being made to provide varied
types of mutsic.

The combos play from 9:00-11:30
at night with beer being served until
twelve. The combos stop early to
allow the tables to be cleared, be-
cause Virginia state law requires all
beer to be off the tables by mid-
night. At present there is a one
dollar per person admission charge
to the combos although there is a
possibility that there may be one
or two free combos later in the
year.

Most of the people who have at-
tended the past two parties have been
W&L men with dates, although
there have been some stags. Siags
were more noticeable last Saturday
due to the snowstorm. The crowds
were large, however, there has been
plenty of room for dancing re
maiming

demics. Seventy-eight per cent think
they should have more say in decid-
ing curriculum. However, the stu-
dent leaders did not express much
interest in having more say in con-
ducting classes or determining
grades,

But they definitely want to be
heard on other campus matters.
Seventy-seven per cent said students
should have more say in making
social rules; 56 per cent said stu-
dents should have more say in dis-
ciplining those who break social
rules. This was a special concern
here as recently as last fall when
the IFC petitioned for total con-
trol over its own affairs.

When asked to judge how well
administrators are listening to stu-
dents, 72 per cent of the respondents
said that administrators on their
campus would listen and consider
each student’s suggestion, which
seems to be the case on this campus.
However, while there may not be a
lack of communication often there
is a lack of administrative action‘
from the student’s viewpoint. Al- —
though administrators are willing to
talk, students have not always seen
enough results to satisfy them.

Looking at their total college ex-
perience, 86 per cent of the respond-
ents feel that it is very important
in preparing them for a full and
useful life, but they attached less
importance to their studies. Only
36 per cent described their courses
as very important alone in prepar-
ing them for a full and useful life.
Therefore, living on campus is what
84 per cent recommended for stu-
dents who want to derive the most
benefit from college.

Concerning hero worship in an
admirability poll, less than $0 per
cent of the respondents called any
one man “very admirable.” Rating
the highest was Martin Luther King,
closely followed by John F. Ken-
nedy.

In the “not very admirable” cate-
gory, Eldridge Cleaver came in
first with 48 per cent rating him as
such. Runner-up in this category
was President Nixon with 28 per
cent of the students awarding him
this dubious achievement.

Forty-seven per cent of the res-
pondents said that, by and large,
their parents would not rate these
people the same as they did.

Besides thinking they have dif-

Hollins co-ed scores
Gingold’s language

Editor, Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I was fortunate enough to be one
of the co-eds participating in las!
week's Co-ed Week. I say “for-
tunate” because I found “Contact”
to be not only enjoyable, but highly
rewarding. | did, however, regret
being at “Contact” at times. These
times were when Mr. Jeff Gingold
decided to draw attention to him-
self with his superb displays of
obscene language.

I have been told by many people
that Mr. Gingold is intelligent; if
this is so, he does an excellent job
of hiding that fact. No intelligent
person would find it necessary to
resort to the sort of tactics Mr.
Gingold frequently employs to make
his position clear.

- Mr Gingold has every right to
exfress his opinions—1 don't deny
that. It is truly lamentable, how-
ever, that a person of Mr. Gingold’s
reputed intelligence must behave in
a manner reserved exclusively for
those of questionable character and
background.

“Magic Mel” works his way in for another lay-up

—photo by Casselle

Road trip brings an upset

It was a pretty good trip down
to Mars Hill, North Carolina for the
varsity basketball team. But it must
have seemed twice as long on the
way back to Washington and Lee.
The reason was an unfortunate en-
counter with the Mars Hill basket-
ball squad. Somehow, Mars Hill did
not roll over and die, instead they
slew the Generals. The score was
87-79 and the details were grue-
some.

Mars Hill had gone completely
gung-ho on the idea of gunning
down the Generals. They were up
for the game to an extent that is
hard to believe. As for the Generals,
they had not yet recovered from
their whipping from Old Dominion
College last weekend.

The game itself was close up
until the end. Fouls hurt Washing-
ton and Lee badly but the excellent
foul shot percentage for Mars Hill

was even more deadly. The boys
in blue had the lead, but as was
the case against O.D.C., they were
forced to relinquish their margin
because of a late surge by the
opponents.

“Magic Mel” Cartwright pumped
in 23 points in the losing effort.
Lean and mean Mike Neer con-
tributed 17 points and 20 rebounds.
Close behind the big men were Stu
Fauber with 13 points and Captain
Norwood Morrison who put in 12
points.

Coach Canfield’s team has reach-
ed a record of 13-6. However, if
you look ahead on the schedule,
you will find tough obstacles still
ahead. V.C.U. has already beaten
WAL by seven. Fairleigh-Dickinson
is an Outstanding small college team,
even when trapped in Doremus.
And finally, don't forget what hap-
pened in the C.A.C. last year de-
pite what all the experts believed!

West Virginia Wesleyan GH
Loyola flushed out of pool

Three big records fell as the
W&L_ natators swept to a_ pair,
of massive victories over Loyola of
Baltimore: and West Virginia Wes-
leyan. The 400 yard freestyle relay
team of Roger Martin, Bim Clark,
Alan Corwith and Bill Brumback
set the new record of 3:06.6 seconds
as the Generals overpowered Loyola
72-32 on Friday evening.

On Saturday afternoon, the 400
yard medley relay team of Roger
Martin, Price Blackford, Bim Clark,
and Bill Brumback combined for a
new school and pool record of
3:34.8 seconds, while Clark scored

 

a 1:57.9 second time in the 200
yard butterfly to set a new school
and pool record as W&L glided
over West Virginia Wesleyan 65-38.
The Generals end their dual meets
with a 5-2 record.

Bert Meem led the charge in the
Loyola meet winning both the 1000
yard freestyle with a 11:55.5 score
and the 200 butterfly event with
2:09.9 second performance. The
Generals opened with the team of
Roger Martin, John Lawlor, With-
ers Davis, and Mike Kirshbaum

winning the 400 yard medley relay

EC passes report on
faculty regulations along

with parking motion

(Continued from Page 1)
can(not) reasonably be inforced.”
The EC recommended that punish-
ment for extreme actions of
this code should be left to the SAC,
but that the code as a strict regula-
tion should be dropped.

The EC also struck a blow for
the autonomy of the IFC by asking
that supervision and control of the
hours and number of fraternity
house parties should be left to the
IFC, Faculty regulation of such mat-
ters was thought to impair the ability
of the IFC “to exercise positive
and forthright leadership.”

The EC declined to make any
specific suggestions as to parietals,
but it did note that the current
policy of faculty control was not in
keeping with general philosophy
which the EC’s report represented.
Rather, the EC expressed the idea
that “parietals should be controlled
exclusively by those members mak-
ing up any given residential com-
munity.”

Upon turning its attention to ex-
tracurricular activities, the EC ex-
pressed doubt whether over-exten-
sion into activities was the cause
of sub-par grades. In light of this,
the committee suggested three
things: 1) students on academic pro-
bation should be allowed to partici-
pate in one extracurricular activity,
2) academic qualifications for candi-
dates for certain specified positions
should be changed from requiring
both a 2.00 cumulative average and
a 2.00 on work in the previous
semester to require only that the
student have a 2.00 cumlative aver-
age, provided the student is not on
academic probation, 3) restrictions
on activities should be removed for
all students with a cumulative 2.00
average not on academic probation.

The above report was proposed
as a motion by Law representative
Phil Thompson and was passed

unanimously.

Survey studies students’ concerns and problems

(Continued from Page 2)
ferent heroes than their parents,
many college students probably
would say they have different opin-
ions concerning the use of drugs.

Seventy-eight per cent of the stu-
dents surveyed said laws concern-
ing marijuana should be made less
strict. Eighty-one per cent said
there should be more drug educa-
tion on their campus; 59 per cent
said use of drugs is increasing, as
it seems to be here.

Although they noted an increase
in misuse of drugs, student leaders
rated alcohol as more of a problem
than drugs. Thirty-six per cent called
alcohol “often” a problem while
only 13 per cent called drugs “often”
a problem.

When estimating the percentage
of students who use marijuana, 16
per cent of the respondents said 50
to 80 per cent of their peers use
it; 30 per cent of the respondents
said that 25 to 49 per cent of their
peers use it; and 30 per cent said
10 to 24 per cent of their peers
use it.

The estimations of the percentage
of students using other drugs such
as LSD, Speed, and barbituates were

much lower than the marijuana use
estimates, generally in the 0-5 per
cent range.

Eighty-three per cent of the res-
pondents said they personally knew
someone who has used drugs, Thirty-
six per cent said they did not think
most students who use drugs knew
what they could do to them physi-
cally and mentally, but 42 per cent
said they thought students did know
what drugs could do.

In another question related to
the personal lives of their college
peers, the student leaders seemed to
evade making moral judgements.
When asked how students on their
campus would react to an unmar-

ried couple living together, 48 per
cent of the respondents said most
students would think it “was none
of their business.” Twenty-three per
cent said most students would think
it “was okay.”

Considering premarital sex, 66 per
cent of the student leaders said
most students would think it is “up
to the individual;” 23 per cent said
they would think “it is okay under
some circumstances;” only six per
cent said they would think it is
“always wrong.”

However, only 13 per cent of the
respondents rated sexual promiscuity
as a problem on their campus; 36
per cent said it was not a problem.
