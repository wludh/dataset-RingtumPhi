Kevin
Raymond
Baker
1949-1970

Kevin Raymond Baker, a
junior at Washington and Lee,
was fatally injured in an auto-
mobile accident near Woodstock,
Virginia early Sunday morning.

An outstanding student, Kevin
had been in several positions of
leadership upon the campus. In
addition to being an honor roll
student, he excelled in debating
and served as co-captain of the
team during this year. This past
Spring Kevin was elected to the
Executive Committee as a repre-
sentative for the Junior class.
Baker was also a member of
Kappa Alpha Order.

Born in 1949 in Arlington,
Kevin was the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Raymond E. Baker of
Lynchburg. Suriving Baker be-
sides his parents are his two
brothers, Gregory and Dylan, a

sister, Lisa, all of Lynchburg,
and his maternal grandmother,
Mrs. James A. Toomey of

Washington, D.C.

Kevin was an_ outstanding
member of the debate team dur-
ing his short tenure as captain
of the team. Throughout his
three years of participation in
this activity, Kevin accumulated
numerous regional and national
awards for his oratorical talents.
At the time of the accident he
was returning from a _ debate
tournament at Dartmouth Col-
lege in Hanover, New Hamp-
shire.

Phe fatal accident occurred at
about 5 a.m. Sunday when the
car in which he was riding hit a
guard rail and spun out of con-
trol. Following the accident
police were unable to determine
which of the three riders was
the driver. They did venture that
the driver apparently fell asleep
at the wheel. Kevin was immedi-
ately rushed to Woodstock Hos-
pital along with Professor Chaf-
fin and fellow student Tim
Wright, but was pronounced
dead on arrival.

A low Mass was given in his
respect at 11:00 a.m. this morn-
ing in his native diocese at Holy
Cross Roman Catholic Church
in Lynchburg. A liturgy of the
dead was given last night at
8:00 at the Whitten Funeral
Home

 

 

 

 

Dr. William Frankena, philosophy professor at the University of
Michigan, will speak in Lee Chapel next week.

Visiting lecturers will
discuss varied topics

A series of outstanding lecturers
begins tomorrow with the appear-
ance in Lee Chapel of Dr. Rocce
Paone, a foreign affairs expert from
the United States Naval Academy
at Annapolis. He will be followed
next week by Dr. Bernard Knox,
an expert in classical Greek and
Dr. William Frankena, a philosophy
professor from the University of
Michigan. The following week will
be highlighted by an appearance
by Dr. Jacques Harde, a French
scholar at the University of North
Carolina.

With the exception of Dr. Paone,
all of the speakers are appearing
under the sponsorship of the Uni-
versity Center in Virginia.

Dr. Paone will speak tomorrow
night in the Chapel on the topic of
the “Nature of Soviet Activity in
the South Asian Periphery.” The
program will begin at 8:00 p.m.

Dr. Paone is Professor of Foreign
Affairs and Director of the Foreign
Affairs Conferences of the Naval
Academy. His son, Fred, is a sopho-
more at Washington and Lee

Dr. Bernard Knox, director of
the Center for Hellenic Studies, in
Washington, D. C., will speak at
8:00 p.m. Monday, March 2, in Lee

Memorial services set for Lee Chapel,

to be conducted by Sprunt and Hodges

Plans have been finalized for a
memorial service to be given to-
morrow in memory of the late Pro-
fessor William W. Chaffin and Kevin
R. Baker. They were fatally in-
jured in an automobile accident just
north of Woodstock, Va. early Sun-
day morning.

The service will be held in the
Lee Chapel at 1:00 p.m. and should
be over by 1:15 in order that it
will not conflict with luncheon
schedules at the fraternity houses.

Services will be conducted jointly
by Dean David W. Sprunt and Dr.
Louis W. Hodges, both of the de-
partment of Religion. Choral music
will be provided by the Washington
and Lee Glee Club under the di-
rection of Dr. Robert Stewart. The
Glee Club will sing a hymn and
will be accompanied by Alan B

GaNun, a junior, on the organ

Funeral services for Kevin Baker
were held this morning at Holy
Cross Roman Catholic Church in
Lynchburg. A low mass was said
at 11 a.m. in the church of his
native diocese. Last night a liturgy
of the dead was given at eight in
the Whitten Funeral Home. Burial
followed the funeral service.

Professor Chaffin is survived only
by his mother, Mrs. Richard B
Chaffin of Richmond, who has set
the funeral for Thursday, February
26 at 11 a.m. in the L. T. Christian
and Sons Funeral Home in Rich-
mond

In the aftermath of the tragedy
numerous Washington and Lee
activities and classes have been
postponed or cancelled. A manda-
tory University assembly was sched

uled for this morning, but it has
been cancelled subject to further
notice. Had the assembly been held,

it would have conflicted in time
with the Kevin Baker funeral
Last night the Executive Com-

mittee and the _ Inter-Fraternity
Council cancelled their meetings in
memory of the deceased. Kevin had
been a Junior class representative
on the EC. With few exceptions,
close friends of Professor Chaffin
have called off classes and those
teachers who had Kevin in their
classes have cancelled them

The third party in the accident,
junior Tim Wright from Beaumont,
Texas was at first listed as in serious
condition, but is now in fair condi-
tion at Woodstock Hospital. He suf-
fered a severe concussion and facial
lacerations

Chapel. His topic will be “Euripides,
‘The Most Tragic of the Poets’.”

Before joining the Center for
Hellenic Studies, Dr. Knox served
as a member of the faculty of Yale
University for 14 years. During the
academic year 1962-63, he was
Sather Lecturer at the University of
California.

Dr. Knox wrote the script for
and performed in four half-hour
color films for educational television
on Sophocles’ “Oedipus the King.”
He is the author of several books,
including “Oedipus at Thebes,” “The
Ajax of Sophocles,” “Oedipus the
King,” and “The Heroic Temper.”

Dr. William Frankena, professor
of philosophy at the University of
Michigan, will speak at 8:00 p.m.
Wednesday, March 4 in duPont
Auditorium. His subject will be “The
Principles of Morality.”

A member of the Michigan facu-
ity for 32 years, Dr. Frankena has
been chairman of the department
of philosophy since 1947. During
the 1968-69 academic year, he was
a Fellow at the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences.

Books written by Dr. Frankena
include: “Ethics, Three Historical
Philosophies of Education,” and
“Some Beliefs about Justice.” He
has been a Visiting Professor at
Columbia, Princeton, Harvard,
Washington and Tokyo universities.

Dr. Harde will speak in Lee
Chapel on March 10 at 8:15 p.m.
His topic will be “Marcel Proust
and the Theme of Death.”

A native of Dinan, France, Dr
Harde was educated in the United
States. He has served two terms as
president of the American Associa-
tion of Teachers of French. He is
the author of “Letters of Louvois,”
a collection of studies in Romance
languages and literature.

Dr. Harde received his Ph.D.
from the University of North Caro-
lina and was a Professor of French
at Guilford College before return-
ing to UNC as a faculty member
Among his credits, he is currently a
member of the Executive Council
of the American Association of
Teachers, Chairman of the Humani-
ties Division at UNC and a member
of the South Atlantic Modern Lan
guage Association and the Modern
Humanities Research Association.

He has also been the recipient of

the Palmes Academiques decoration

 

 

William
Wells
Chaffin
1930-1970

William Wells Chaffin, Associ-
ate Professor of English and
Speech at Washington and Lee,
was fatally injured Sunday in
an automobile accident eight
and one-half miles north of
Woodstock, Virginia.

This was the same accident in
which W&L_ student Kevin
Baker also died and Tim Wright
was seriously injured. The acci-
dent occured when the car in
which they were riding struck a
guardrail on Interstate 81. There
were no other cars involved in
the accident. Police officers on
hand said that they had not
been able to determine who was
the driver of the car, but that
the driver had apparently fallen

asleep at the wheel. The three
were returning from the Dart-
mouth Invitational Debate Tour

nament at Hanover, N. H. in
which they had participated. The
accident occurred at approxi-
mately 5 a.m. near Toms Brook.

A native of Richmond, Pro
Chaffin graduated from
the University of Richmond in
1952. He received his LL.B. from

fessor

the same institution in 1954
Further work earned him his
M.A. in Speech in 1959 from

the University of Virginia, Fol-
lowing graduate work he was
Assistant Professor of Speech at
Madison College and a part-time
instructor at U.Va. for a brief
time before coming to W&L in
1960. In 1967 he was promoted
to an Associate Professor

At Washington and Lee, Pro-
fessor Chaffin had been respon
sible for the creation of the
school’s highly successful debat-
ing program, both on the inter-
collegiate and __ intracollegiate
levels. Prior to his coming to
WAL, the school had had no
such program. Through diligent
work as debate coach Professor
Chaffin had built a consistently
superior intercollegiate team
which was probably the Univer-
sity’s most successful venture of
all in intercollegiate competition

Professor Chaffin is survived
by his mother, Mrs. Lucille W
Chaffin of Richmond, who is ar
ranging the funeral. Services will
be held on Thursday at 11:00
a.m. in Richmond

THE RING-TUM PHI

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition
Tuesday, February 24, 1970

D

No more to build on there. And they, since they
Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.

—Robert Frost

And so will we . . . but to what affairs? To what can we
turn wherein the memory of William Chaffin and Kevin Baker
and the memory of their dedication is not at the forefront.

William Chaffin was an institution of Washington and Lee

and an inspiration to a generation of debaters. His charisma
and dedication created an unmatched sense of pride within the
University and brought respect to Washington and Lee from
colleges across the nation. Our mentor-friend, honed to bril-
liance in the art of arts, has left a disproportionate void.

We lack the perspective to do justice to Kevin Baker in
this early eulogy. Kevin Baker was a bright promise, a fresh
breeze; his determination, his ability, his life, a mounting
crescendo. His death too quick a denouement.

In no respect did these two men fail to serve the Uni-
versity or to represent it admirably. They brought much and
they left much. So. We turn to our affairs.

 

Back to perambulation

Trying to find a parking space within a mile of the W&L
campus these days is about as likely as a critical overabun-
dance of applications for membership in Mr. Nixon’s newly
proposed volunteer army.

The lack of foresight of our planners in Washington Hall
is truly astonishing, especially considering the magnitude of
the current building project. It would seem that such a well
thought out construction project could have been drafted
with a little more attention to the needs of our present stu-
dents, many of whom must drive to campus.

We are certainly not criticizing the construction of the
gym addition. Under the circumstances the plea of several
University officials for students within reasonable walking
distance not to drive to campus is appropriate. Considering a
project requiring about three million dollars, however, it is
nothing less than ridiculous that ample provision for student
parking was not made for the coming eighteen month con-
struction period.

 

Geese and golden eggs

We find the report to be submitted to the Lexington City
Council concerning the possible levy of a student property
tax to be most disturbing.

We concede the contention that students who register to
vote in municipal elections could be ethically taxed by Lex-
ington. However, we do not feel that the entire student body
can be justly forced to pay local personal property taxes and
automobile license fees.

First of all, most of our parents are assessed for these
taxes in our home communities. Second, the students here
(with few exceptions) have no earned incomes. Finally, it is
no well-guarded secret that Lexington merchants greatly re-
semble in their actions and prices the proverbial vultures
ready to swoop down on some hapless student’s unsuspecting
wallet. If anyone cares to dispute this last argument, we ad-
vise him to visit Lexington during our spring vacation, and
then attempt to claim that this town does not live off W&L’s
blood.

We hold the opinion that Lexington already derives
enough of its sorely needed revenue from W&L students.
Granted that Lexington is short of capital, we frankly ob-
ject to the argument printed in the Friday Ring-tum Phi that
the students are the logical answer to this problem. Lexing-
ton does the very minimum for its nine-month visitors and it
should respect that status—not tax us as residents.

 

The grand old rag sheet

Progress is by nature valued subjectively, and as such is
often considered a cruel monster. Significant in such judg-
ments is that many events which are excused as “progressive”
are actually not. The end of the Tuesday Edition is a cruel
thing, especially to those of us who have made the Tuesday
Edition a part of ourselves. However, in this case, we feel it is
progress in that with the new Wednesday Ring-tum Phi, we
can offer our readers a better product.

The Ring-tum Phi is approaching its seventieth birthday,
but it displays considerable more vitality than most septu-
agenerians. The Tuesday Edition barely saw its twentieth
birthday, but in its short history the Tuesday Edition served
its readers well. This has not always been the best of all
possible newspapers to be sure, but neither has it been a
bad one. In the past four years at least, the Tuesday Edition
has played an important role in stimulating the broad changes
that have been initiated, and in commending and condemn-
ing when such opinion has been needed. The days of fish
coming gift-wrapped in Tuesday Phis are gone. But, crass
inflation has exerted its iniquitous force and sent the Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi into history.

Organization simulations
as an aspect of PSCIRA

By JOHN MOTSINGER

International Organization simu-
lations sponsored by many schools
and groups around the country are
attempts to re-create for a_ stu-
dent group the situation found on
the floor of United Nations, NATO
and OAS meetings.

Washington and Lee has a long
history of simulation work in the
Mock Conventions held here every
four years, and started last year to
sponsor a Model Organization of
American States. Moot Court com-
petition in the Law School is another
type of simulation.

The 1970 Model OAS attempts to
provide a forum where students
from Washington and Lee and nine
East Coast colleges can debate Inter-
American policy issues, with each
of the 25 teams representing the
policy of each of the member

s individuality,

calls for thoughtful consideration

By DR. ARTHUR SCHARFF

Contact Week was a good time
for a bit of reflection as well as all
the expression and absorption. Par-
ticularly is this true when so many
seemingly brilliant and “new” ideas
are being bandied about. In some
cases, perhaps, the phosphorescence
is blinding us to what is causing it
all, Good wine comes from ferment-
ing grapes, certainly, but then so
does an awful stench, and much
just pure rot. It depends on what
the aims of the ferment are and
how it is controlled.

Washington and Lee is in the
process of working out a new cur-
riculum providing for a revolution-
ary new short term so that students
may do intensive specializing and
in-depth introspection into a favorite
field without interference from lesser
things like math, English and other
required courses. Co-eds were on
the campus for a week, will soon
be here for a year, and there is
much batting of th breeze about
their being here on a somewhat
more permanent basis.

There is discussion of increased
heterogeneity in the student body;
of attracting representatives of min-
ority groups and underprivileged
classes, even at the expense of aca-
demic standards: of encouraging in-
tense specialization rather than the
acquisition of a general background;
of practical and job-oriented train-
ing and “frill” courses: of freedom
of choice and student power; of “in
loco parentis” versus “laissez faire”;
of the value and relevance of every-
thing from pot to Plutarch.

Long hair and short hair, unisex
and homosex—there is no dearth of
books and certainly no dearth of
words, supplemented by visual aids,
projects, dramatizations, grants-in-
aid, recordings, tapes, movies on
wider and still wider screens, folk
songs and films, headbands and hap-
penings, pros and cons, semi-pros
and ex-cons—on all of this.

The real question is not so much
the value of all this as simply: Do
you really want it? And what of it
do you really want? With intensive
study programs out go long, contem-
plative sessions and semi-dull lec-
tures that require only half your
energies, along with the freedom to
cut classes with impunity when you
are suffering from the results of a
heavy night,

With co-eds out go long Spring
weekends, “down the read”, and the

thrill of having a date down for
Fancy Dress. Remember, when they
are co-eds they are not your date,
they are anybody's date; the com-
petition is there on the spot and
you have no special privileges. When
you get the feminine viewpoint too
your own is of much less impor-
tance.

With heterogeneity come unrest
and dilution as well as stimulation.
The chances of getting together with
a bunch of fellows of your own
kind who think and feel as you do is
lessened, not increased. With spec-
ialization you get less chance to ex-
plore other fields in which you
might find an interest, albeit a sec-
ondary one. Specialization is by its
very nature anathema to intellectual
curiosity. With acceleration you are
out in the world waiting in the rain
for the early morning bus down-
town much sooner, And when the
university no longer stands “in loco
parentis’, there is no other “paren-
tis”; you have to do ail those things
yourself,

Do you really want all those re-
sponsibilities sooner than you have
to? Are you really ready to take the
consequences of a faulty decision
due to inexperience? Have you even
thought out what the consequences
are? Those of us who have attended
Continental universities know that
there the university doesn’t concern
itself with your personal life or your
individual problems at all—and that
it is sometimes pretty lonely and
cold out there, too.

Washington and Lee is in many
ways a pecular school. It has a dis-
tinct individuality and a tone all
its own, both academically and soci-
ally. It caters to a rather restricted
group and offers a particular type
of education, tailored as nearly as
possible to the probable needs of
that group in exercising its func-
tions within the whole of society.
These functions are not inconsider-
able, nor are they the same as those
of numerous other groups, though
they are probably neither greater
nor less in total value. These func-
tions are not likely to disappear no
matter what changes occur in them.

Society has been undergoing
changes for so long that it is com-
pletely unreal to imagine that it is
suddenly going to stop or that any
one moment in time or any one
group of thinkers, no matter how
profound or how right, has found
the key to complete (and thorough-

Letters to the Editor...

Henberg finds fault
with Friday editorial

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

1 write in response to last Fri-
day's editorial entitled “The Wrong
Problem.” Somehow the Friday edi-
tion has come under the impression
that the B.C. has already removed
the student body assessment for
Contact. This is simply not true
as of last Friday, the topic had not
even been discussed before the Ex
ecutive Committee

ht is true as the editorial states
that | seriously question whether
giving funds from a general student
body assessmeni can be justified as

long as the chairman of Contact
is selected by the IFC. Yet the
thrust of my motion (when it is
presented) will be toward asking

that the chairman be selected by a
joint EC IFC committee
Certainly | am aware of the
danger of a fine program being lost
through the possible withholding of
the student bad Yet

this is still to be decided

mscssieni

a thatier

by the entire Executive Committee.
The “rumors of a compromise solu-
tion” seem a bit premature as it
seems to me that there is not yel
a problem—or at least wasn't before
last Priday

Finally, | agree with the edi-
torial’s observation about the exorbi-
tant cost of university cocktail par-
ties. The money for class dues is
now currently collected by the class
officers on authority of an EC
resolution passed some years ago
That resolution set no limit on the
amount collected, and the escalation
of class dues has been—admittedly
due to E.C, negligence over the past
few vears. In my mind Contact is
certainly a much more worthwhile
project than the cocktail parties,
and | stress that it is fully my
intention (and has been all year)
to ask the EC to place some reason
able upper limit on the amount col
lected for class dues. Such a resolu
tion, however, is contingent upon
the final decision as to how many
parties will be possible under the
few calendar

ly undesirable) stability. Do you
really want to throw all this away?
Even more importantly, do you
want to deprive others of getting
this type of education even if you
yourself don’t want it? Think over
the reasons why you came to Wash-
ington and Lee in the first place.
Have things really changed very
much since then? Or is it just you?
Are your reasons no longer valid,
or is it that you just didn’t see very
clearly then? Are you sure you are
seeing more clearly now? Is there
something really wrong with the in-
stitution itself? Are the changes you
are advocating going to remedy that
without giving rise to other and
even more nearly insoluble prob-
lems?

Washington and Lee, being a very
special type of school, appeals to a
very special group of prospective
students and parents. Is this bad? Is
there something wrong with offering
a special education to a_ special
group rather than an all-encompass-
ing one to just any—and every-
body? Which do you want? You
can't have both. Is this education of
lesser value than some other? And
will a Washington and Lee which
offers everything to anybody still
appeal to a sufficiently large group
to attract desirable students? Or
even enough of them? It has built-
in factors which distinguish it and
cannot be altered, and some of
them are disadvantages rather than
advantages.

Remember that when Washington
and Lee has what every other uni-
versity has then it competes directly
with every other university, not with
just some of them. In getting the
full viewpoint you also get the full
competition. A heterogenous student
body is just that: heterogeneous.
Can Washington and Lee compete
successfully with schools that have
huge state and municipal subsidies
and are located in bustling metro-
polises with built-in feeder popula-
tions and all the other attractions of
a big city, when the competition is
on their terms not ours?

More than everything else, do
you really want to lose your indivi-
duality? Do you want to be some-
thing special or would you rather
just fade into the mob? When you
do what everybody else does, have
what everybody else has, then you
are what everybody else is. You are
no longer you, you are one of those.

Certainly Washington and Lee
wants change. Change is the only
unchanging thing there is. But what
does it want? All? Anything? Every-
thing? Or those things becoming to
it and perhaps to it alone? Change
just of itself is no virtue, It is not
always even profitable from a crass
ly material standpoint, With every
good comes an evil just as surely as
with every evil comes a good, This
is still as true as when the Platonists
expounded on it. Are you willing to
support the evils that will inevitably
come with your changes? Is the
good to be gained from them suffi-
ciemt to warrant the sacrifice-—es-
pecially since a large part of that
sacrifice will be made not by you
but by those yet to come, even as
the rewards will be reaped mostly
by them. Think carefully whether
your change is worth the price

states.

The Political Science Club and
International Relations Association
sponsors teams which travel to vari-
ous colleges and conferences to
represent member states in simula-
tions of United Nations proceedings.
Team members are needed to repre-
sent the Brazzaville Congo at
George Washington University,
March 5-8, to represent a Security
Council power at Hollins during the
March 20-22 weekend, and to repre-
sent Czechoslovakia in New York in
mid-April. Persons interested in be-
ing representatives should contact
me at 463-6032 or Mare Small at
463-S001.

Educators are of no single opinion
concerning simulation work of this
type. Objections include that model
sessions are inherently lacking in
reality because not all factors can
be known by participants, working
conditions in the UN and OAS head-
quarters and sessions cannot be
simulated on such a small and short
basis, and that participating students
and simulators do not know their
roles well enough.

Advocates of models imperfect,
provide a debate type forum within
which students begin to understand
the basic problems confronting
many of the member nations and
the world, the conflicting ideologies,
personalities, economies, races, and
cultures. Each student finds him-
self knowing one country and its
problems, and through simulation
work, attempts to see how these
problems are resolved with other
nations,

In order to better
Communist thinking, the W&L
PSCIRA teams have _ requested
Communist and quasi-Communist
states such as Czechoslovakia and
Congo-Brazzaville, as compared with
Western powers last year. To under-
stand third world problems, PSCIRA
has represented Pakistan, Nepal and
smaller Latin American countries.

The teams started last year at
Washington and Lee worked with
Randolph-Macon to win national
awards in both U.N. and O.ASS.
conferences for representation of
Guatemala and Mexico, This made
the tally for the two schools the
best in the nation last year. Work
with the Model OAS on campus
and with the Randolph-Macon
Model Security Council provided
both schools with a pool of veteran
simulation students.

The model organization confer-
ences, whether they be Moot Court,
Mock Elections, Mock Conventions,
or International Organizations
represent a low level, non-complex
type of simulation or game.

Possibilities for gaming include
computerized simulated nuclear
wars, neighborhood integration and
stabilization, predicting of election
outcome given certain variables, and
the list is practically infinite. More
sophisticated model gaming can be
developed to a point where players
have no rules and have no idea of
opponent strategies or positions, A
computer programmed game, for
instance, could be used in classes
or small groups involving constantly
shifting positions and rules, with
rules developing after each decision
is made by a player. Some games
have been developed which are so
complex that each player must be
a programmed computer using cy-
bernetics, or a learning function.

Possibilities for future work on
the campus with simulations of all
sizes and complexities exist in all
of the social sciences. In any study
of conflict (cultural, economic, busi-
ness, management, politics, social
or psychological) the simulation pro-
vides a device for studying the dy-
namics and the result of the con-
flict. the effects of various decisions
made by participants, and the effect
of changing variables or the rules of
the game.

However, the game can be con-
sidered only as an imperfect repre-
sentation of the total reality in-
volved, in that variables have to be
isolated, rules have to be drawn,
and many of the influences involved
are left out, either by decision of the
gamers or by faulty knowledge

If a student assumes that a simu
lation is only a representation of a
possible circumstance, and does not
iry to extend the effects of one
simulation into situations which are
only slightly similar or which have
key differences, he will have used

The Generals took out some of
their frustrations by destroying Davis
and Elkins College 107-80. It was
a fitting occasion, being “Norwood
Morrison and Stuart Fauber Night.”
The two seniors from Lynchburg
were honored at a pre-game cere-
mony at mid-court.

The game turned out to be some-
what of a zoo. The contact got
pretty thick as the tempo picked
up. The starting five were replaced
en masse early in the first period.
The reserves got some vital ex-
perience and poured in more and
more points against their poorly
performing opponents.

Mel Cartwright played yet another
fantastic game. Mel controlled the
boards and proved that he could
be just as deadly with jump shots
as with his familiar driving lay-ups.
Cartwright totaled 17 points to be
high man in the balanced scoring
attack of W&L.

Mike Neer added plenty of muscle
under those rough boards. His 13
points were earned the hard way
against a relatively big group of

was the engineer of the Fairleigh-
Dickinson conquest. He was an out-
standing ball handler and superb
shot particularly from the corners.
Plus, Shulman could jpass like a
magician when he was unable to
shoot.

Paired with Shulman was a larger
and stronger guard named Branch.
Branch pumped accurately both
from the floor and the foul line
getting a total of 23 points.

For W&L, Neer was the bright
spot with 23 points and just for
comfort big Mike pulled down 17
rebounds. The quick W&L center
has the highest scoring average for
the season of all the Generals at
17.4,

Fairleigh-Dickinson was tough,
without a doubt, but Washington
and Lee let them direct the action
The visitors were able to play their
game of run and gun _ basketball.
The home five had problems when
it came to getting the ball into the
tough trio under the goal—Cart-
wright, Neer, and Daniel. And from
the outside edges of the court we

just did not hit like their guard
did. Simply stated, W&L did not
play its game and its timing and
balance were consequently thrown
off.

Looking to the future the basket-
ball squad finds no relief. V.C.U.
is the last home opponent of the
season, The game is scheduled for
tonight at 8:00, The Richmond-based
team outscored W&L 90-83 earlier
this season. But the trap is set in
Doremus and Coach Canfield sure
would like to give the home fans
a final victory for this year.

After tonight’s contest the C.A.C.
remains to be fought out. St. Louis
is the site and defending champion
Southwestern at Memphis is the

team to beat. The Southwestern
team returns intact but so do the
Generals. However, the Generals
might want to retaliate from last

year’s championship game.

As mentioned previously, Mike
Neer is leading the team in scor-
ing at 17.4 points. The big blonde
boy is also way ahead of anyone

Swimming team 1s second in state meet

Over the past weekend, the W&L
natators led by Bill Brumback, Bim
Clark and Alan Corwith captured
second place in the Virginia Inter-
collegiate Swimming Championships
out of nine participating teams. The
William and Mary varsity team won
the championship as had been ex-
pected.

“Baltimore Bill” Brumback prov-
ed that he was the fastest swimmer
in the state of Virginia winning the
50 yard freestyle event—W&L’s
only first place finish—with a 22.3
second time in W&M’s 25 yard
pool. Brumback was able to cap-
ture second place in the 100 yard
freestyle event.

After Thursday’s competition
W&L found itself in fifth place
behind W&M, VPI, VMI, ODU,

and Randolph-Macon. Early in Fri-
day’s events W&L moved into sec-
ond place where the Blue swimmers
remained, sustaining several chal-
lenges from VPI and Old Dominion.
[he final score of the major par-
ticpants in the meet was: William
and Mary varsity 514, Washington
and Lee 288, VPI 269, Old Domi-

Blackford, Bim Clark and Bill
Brumback were able to capture a
second in this event with a 3:53.7
second finish. The 800 yard free-
style relay of John Lawlor, Bim

managed a second with a 7:52.9
second finish.

W&L to get
million dollar
srant fund

Washington and Lee University
has been named the recipient of a
charitable remainder trust currently
valued at approximately $1 mil-

lion, President E. R. Huntley an-
nounced,

The estate of stocks and bonds
was left by Mrs. Mary Hudson
Floyd of Pittsburgh, Pa., who died
August 30, 1969.

According to her four-page, hand
written will, the residue of the
estate is to come to Washington
and Lee Univsrsity on the death of
Mrs. Floyd’s daughter, Mrs. Har-
riet L. McCaskey, of Pittsburgh,
Pa., to establish the S. Leslie
Mestrezat Scholarship Fund,

Individual student scholarships
will be awarded up to $2,000 pei
academic year, by the terms of
Mrs. Floyd’s will.

The fund will be in honor of
Mrs. Floyd's uncle, Mr. Justice S$
Leslie Mestrezat, of Greene Coun
try, Pa., an 1871 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee. He served with
distinction as a justice of the Su-
preme Court of Pennsylvania.

“We are grateful for this signi-
ficant help for Washington and Lee
in the important area of student
scholarship aid,” President Huntley
remarked. “This is a fine example
of what is possible through careful
estate planning in the way of much-
needed aid to the cause of higher
education.”

Mrs. Floyd’s will also bequeathed
$10,000 to the Associate Alumnae
of Vassar College, Poughkeepsie,
New York, and stated that she had
already created a scholarship fund
for Waynesburg College, Waynes
burg, Pa.

Dobbs, Henberg and Swezey

are named Wilson Designates

Washington and Lee Uni-
versity seniors and an alumnus of
WAL are among 1,153 persons who
have been named Woodrow Wilson
Designates by the Woodrow Wilson
National Fellowship Foundation.

Two

The Designates are seniors Gary
H. Dobbs, III, of Birmingham, Ala.
and Marvin C, Henberg of Laramie,
Wyo., and an alumnus, the Rev.
Charles M. Swezey of Lexington.
Mr. Swezey, who is _ assistant
minister of Lexington Presbyterian
Church, was graduated from Wash-
ington and Lee in 1957.

They are among the 1,153 “in-
tellectually promising” students
whose names have been sent by the
foundation to all graduate school
deans in the United States with
a recommendation that they receive
fellowship awards from the gradu-
ate schools.

Woodrow Wilson Designates were
selected from a field of approxi-
matly 12,000 persons nominated for
the honor by more than 800 col-
leges and universities. All indicated

they plan to follow a career in
college teaching.
Dobbs, who is majoring in b

ology, has been an Honor Roll and
Dean's List student at WAL. He is
a member of Phi Beia Kappa and
Phi Eta Sigma, fraternities recogniz-
ing scholastic excellence. He has
been a Research Scholar in the

Robert E. Lee Research Program
of Washington and Lee.

His parents are Mr. and Mrs.
Gary H. Dobbs, Jr. of 3329 Win-
chester Rd., Birmingham, Ala.
Dobbs was graduated from Indian
Springs School there.

Henberg, who is majoring in
philosophy and English, currently
serves as president of the WAL stu-
dent body. Also an Honor Roll and
Dean's List student, he has served
as vice president of Omicron Delta
Kappa, leadership fraternity, and
president of Phi Eta Sigma. He has
been a dormitory counselor, chair-
man of the Student Curriculum
Committee and a contributor to
“Ariel,” the student literary maga-
zine.

He is the son of Mrs. Agnes
F. Henberg of 316 Gibbon in Lar-
amie, Wyo.

After receiving his A.B. degree
at W&L, Mr. Swezey earned the
Bachelor of Divinity degree from
Union Theological Seminary in
Richmond in 1961 and the Master
of Sacred Theology degree from
Yale Divinity School in 1962. In
1968-69, he won a Danforth Campus
Ministry Grant and was appointed
a Research Fellow at Yale Di-
vinity School.

Mr. Swezey joined the staff of
the Lexington Presbyterian Church
in 1962.

the game properly. The problem
of learning from a game is that
circumstances are different and that
each situation has its own variables
and rules. Many inexperienced play-
ers fail to realize the pitfall of
making the assumption that a hypo-
thetical situation represents a speci-
fic problem other than the one
played in the game.

Used cautiously and with due re-
gard to simulation limitations, games
can be productive in the learning
process. Used without such care and
circumspection, games can hinder
development of ihe student’s use of
his own evaluations and faculties of
judgment, the very things the games
and simulations attempt to develop.
