Faculty Adopts
Exam Proposal
For Next Year

Siudents will plan their final ex-
amination schedules individually be-
ginning next year, the university’s
faculty decided this Monday.

Under the new “independent exam
system,” each student will be re-
quired simply to notify the registrar,
one week in advance, of the hour at
which he plans to take each of his
final exams.

When the independent scheduling
system goes into effect next autumn,
students will have nine separate
three-hour exam periods to choose
among. Most students will be tak-
ing four courses with final exams.

The autumn exam period will be-
gin Saturday, Dec. 12, at 9 a.m. and
will continue through noon the fol-
lowing Thursday, Dec. 17. On Sat-
urday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wed-
nesday, exams will be administered
between 9 a.m. and noon and be-
tween 2 and 5 p.m. Only a morning
exam will be given on Thursday, the
last day of examinations.

The student will pick up his exam
questions from the appropriate de-
partment at the beginning of the
period for which he registered to
take each exam.

In courses requiring special physi-
cal arrangements for the final ex-
amination—such as fine arts courses
in which slides to be identified are
shown as part of the final — the de-
partmental faculty will schedule that
portion of the exam at a specific
hour and students will be required
to atiend then.

They will otherwise be entirely
free to register to take their exami-
nations during whichever exam per-
iods they please.

Previously, exams were admini-
stered according to the so-called
“block system,” under which every
student in a particular class or
course had to take the final exami-
nation at the same time as every
other student in the same class or
course. The day and hour for each
exam were determined under an
arbitrary pattern which rotated from
semester to semester.

Under the mew system, once the
siudent draws up his exam schedule
and registers his choices with the
registrar, the schedule is binding on
the student, subject to alteration
only with the approval of the fac-
ulty’s Executive Committee.

Professors will be free to change
their exam questions from one
three-hour period to the next, or te
keep the questions constant through-
out the exam week. In the latter
case, students will be pledged under
WA&L’s Honor System to keep both
the substance and the general na-
ture of the particular exam in strict
confidence

The independent exam-scheduling
sysiem was voted by the faculty
affer extensive investigation of its
merits as well as the merits of al-
ternative systems by the Executive
Committee.

Ihe EC had endorsed a similar
independent scheduling sysiem ear
lier this year, and Student Body
President Swede Henberg attended
part of the faculty's deliberations
Monday to explain the student posi-
tion,

EC Endorses Petition
To Withdraw Troops

By Mack Woodward

In a special meeting Tuesday
evening, the Executive Committee
endorsed as a body the student-cir-
culated petition to cease United
States military involvement in Cam-
bodia.

The petition will be sent to Vir-
ginia’s two U.S. senators, Byrd and
Spong.

Several EC members had signed
the petition individually, but the
special meeting was called last night
to endorse the petition by the EC
as a whole.

In the vote to endorse the student
petition, Andrews cast the only dis
senting vote.

“The concern of the EC is not
just what goes on in this little mic-
rocosm,” said Dave Bethea at Mon-
day night's EC meeting with regard
to the motion he brought to the
floor concerning Freedom Day. The
motion in its original form called
for the EC to support Freedom
Day. Bethea felt that it was “the ob
ligation of the EC” to endorse such
a moon.

Fran Lawrence, president-clect ex
plained to the EC that the theory
behind the motion Bethea presenied
was one of involvement. “This is
happening so many places,” he e-
plained. President Swede Henberg
stated that people should be en
couraged to recognize Freedom Das
so they could become more aware
of what was happening. Alan Pra
ter's repfy to this was, “If to par
ticipaie is to become more aware.
then why don't we strike and go
talk to Air Force or Peace Corp
representatives? Why should we
take a stand?”

After several minutes of
Vice President Phil Thompson re
quested that an amendment be add
ed to the motion which would stale

the EC’s opposition to interference
with students’ class attendance. This
motion to amend was seconded by
Andrews. The amendment was
adopted unanimously, as was the
amended motion.

In its final form, the motion re-
solves that the EC “calls attention
to Freedom Day activities” but sup-
ports the resolution “only to the ex-
tent that individuals be allowed to
exercise their own consciences with-
out physical or psychological intimi-
dation.”

Touching upon a matter of vital
interest to students, Swede Henberg
informed the EC that the Lexing-
ton City Council will vole tomorrow
on a student property tax and car
tax. Dean John had recommended
to him that the EC send several rep-
reseniatives to the meeting to op-
pose the tax in the interest of the
student body, rather than have a
crowd of unorganized protestors.

Henberg said that he would go,
and requested that Thompson,
Tompkins, and Ogilvie accompany
him. Dean Kumpuris remarked that
“a real nice boycott could be or-
ganized” if the tax should pass.

The EC went into closed session
last night to discuss the problem of

Thirty Students Picket Classes;
Rally Hears Huntley Remarks

A group of about 30 students
formed a picket line at 8:00 this
morning in front of the colonnade
to protest scheduled classes today in
order that students might be free to
go to the University of Virginia to
attend rallies occasioned by the re-
cent U.S. involvement in Cambodia.

Several professors called off their
classes in support of the strike; but
Dean of Students Lewis G. John
said that he could see no marked
shift in class attendance, though “it’s
hard to tell at this point.”

The pickets remained on campus
until 10:00, when they left to pre-
pare to travel to the Charlotiesville
campus to attend strike rallies held
this afternoon.

“Our purpose here tonight is not
to burn, but to build this univer-
sity,” said senior Jeff Gingold, or-
ganizer for the Strike Rally which
met in front of Lee Chapel last
night.

A gathering of 300 to 400 inter-
ested students sat on the lawn in
front of Lee Chapel to hear remarks
from Gingold, other W&L students,
two University of Virginia student
strike leaders, two faculty members
and University President Robert E.
R. Huntley.

The group assembled on the lawn
at 7 p.m. to hear a brief concert by
“Cancer,” a student combo,

At 7:30, the speeches began with
prefatory remarks from Gingold,
who stated the purpose of the Wed-
nesday strike.

“We want to shut down the
school so that all students will be
able to go up to Charlottesville and
learn a little something.”

In reaction to rumors of probable
violence during the strike, Gingold
said that the demonstration would
be intended as a peaceful expression
of student convictions. Student pic-
ket lines would only be organized as
a passive manifestation of the belief
thaet the University should suspend
classes for the University of Vir-
ginia occasion.

Gingold outlined the program at
the University of Virginia for which
the strike was called. Jerry Rubin,
one of the nationally known “Chic-
ago Seven”, and William Kunstler,
attorney for the group, will be
speakers at rallies to be held on the
Charlottesville campus this after-

noon and tonight. According to Gin-

“I want to try to get away from ‘Supreme Court interpretations,’ "

gold, suspended classes would per-
mit all students who are interested
in the Charlottesville rally to at-
tend.

After several W&L students out-
lined their beliefs on the new mili-
lary involvement in Cambodia and
the recent death of four students at
Kent State University, two speakers
from the University of Virginia
characterized the agenda for today’s
“Strike” rallies in Charlottesville.

One of the faculty asked to speak
for the rally, politics instructor Paul
Corcoran vocalized his concern at
“the fact that America is devoted to
a policy of killing people.”

Seeing the student response to the
war issue as “growing,” Corcoran
made a distinction between what he
called “personal” and “political” re-
volt.

“In a personal revolution,” Cor-
coran commented, “One has moral
decisions which he must make;
whereas, often in a political revolu-
tion, you are forced to pay the price
of politics,”

President Huntley appeared at the
gathering to address the crowd, ex-
plaining that his open letter to the
Washington and Lee community
was not directed towards the rally
that evening or the strike this morn-
ing, but towards a growing diver-
gent attitude within the community.

Speaking in terms of the educa-
tional function of Washington and
Lee, Huntley felt that “we must all
attempt to walk the tightrope be
tween chaos on one hand and
streamlined efficiency on the other.”

Calling on the audience for a
sense of community, the Presiedni

asked, “I call on you, from what-
ever faction you are in, to share
your deep convictions with those

who would ordinarily share theirs
with you,”

[he rally concluded with brie!
remarks from Henry Sloss, English
instructor, and Jeff Gingold, who
called on all interested students to
participate in the picket lines which
formed this morning.

Text Of President’s Open Letter

(Editor's Note: The following is the
text of an open letter submitted to
the Washington and Lee community
yesterday by President Robert E. R.
Huntley.)

The Washington and Lee com-
munity is fully aware of the deep
concern generated by recent events
that is tearing the fabric of many
colleges and universities across the
nation, Washington and Lee is not
indifferent to these events and un-
derstands the differences of opinion
and high emotions that they give
rise to. The ideal of this University
is to provide a setting and an atmos-
phere where men can reason to-
gether, learn from one another, and
share points of view—no matier
how emotionally charged—without
rancor and in a spirit of tolerance
and good will—to the end that men
might understand truly and well the
complexities of the issues confront-
ing us.

The barriers that threaten to di-
vide us as a nation must not find
their counterpart in barriers divid-
ing us as a community. I refer to

the barriers behind which men re
treat in intellectual and moral isola-
tion when they have somehow con
vinced themselves of the infallible
correctness of their own views and
the base hypocrisy of all others, an
isolation which is characterized by
a fear of sharing one’s deepest con-
victions with any save those who are
known to agree. | know

Legislating Moral Judgments

If you just want to sit here in a vacuum

and discuss the constitution .. .
—John Markham

That’s just what I want to do.
—Drew Kumpuris

Kudos to the EC. It is noble enough to admit a sin has
been committed, but it is even more noble to atone for that
sin. In a special meeting last Thursday night, the EC admitted
its error in judgment and reversed its ruling regarding Ann
Red’s candidacy. Inconsistency with the constitution was cited
as the basis for the reversal.

This display of wisdom on the part of the Executive Com-
mittee was prompted by freshman Alan Prater. The denial
of her candidacy on constitutional grounds stands as a major
victory for those members of the student body and the Exe-
cutive Committee who are still interested in the operation of
student government according to traditional and legal prin-
ciples. One function of the EC is to govern under the con-
stitution as it now reads, and, thankfully, a majority of that
group had the presence of mind to realize this Thursday
night.

the Markham, Dave Bethea, and Glenn Azuma, who
evidently do not acknowledge this duty vis-a-vis their votes
on behalf of Miss Red, might, perhaps, have had a point in
their concern for a more effective integration of exchange
students into our community by allowing them to run for
office. But the EC was simply not in the position in this
particular case to permit her, contrary to the constitution, to
seek the office of class president.

The question at hand Thursday night was, in fact, con-
stitutional. If the student body wants exchange students to be
able to run for office—a problem that could not have been
foreseen when the constitution was drafted—then the prero-
gative rests in the student body to alter the constitution in a
referendum. The EC must not be given the freedom to usurp
the power to amend the constitution by executive fiat, as it in
effect tried to do earlier last week until its ruling was challeng-
ed by a significant number of students.

A less obvious but decidedly pernicious danger lies be-
neath the Ann Red case. If her name had been allowed on
the ballot in violation of the constitution, suppose the EC
decided to ignore the constitution on the matter of enforcing
the honor system? Or, to put this argument in more concrete
terms, would the faculty acquiesce in an independent exam
schedule in the absence of the honor system?

Swede Henberg expressed perhaps even a more frighten-
ing attitude than the one to bypass the constitution, which
might have been dictated by the exigencies of time, since it is
unlikely a constitutional referendum could have been staged
before Monday’s elections. In the regular meeting on April
27, although he abstained as chairman, Henberg made his
opposition to Miss Red’s candidacy clear. In Thursday’s meet-
ing, however, Henberg seemed more concerned about the
fact that the EC would reverse its previous position than that
the proper action was being taken. Fortunately, Thompson’s
plea for responsibility to the student body countered this la-
ment for the EC’s image.

Several suggestions seem evident at this juncture. First,
there should be a constitutional referendum to decide the
matter of exchange students’ participation in student gov-
ernment. Second, the EC should make a more conscientious
effort to govern wisely so that its reputation does not plummet
into the abyss of discredit. We have good reason to believe
that this is already happening. But, is it any wonder?

We spoke last week, for example, with a junior who said
he asked another student at a balloting box for whom he
should vote, and then “just for the hell of it, I voted the
other way.” When we questioned this student about his at-
titude, he pointedly remarked that it seemed to him that this
year’s EC has done nothing for the students. While this state-
ment may not be true in its absolute sense, it does have con-
siderable merit, Relatively too much time was spent by the
EC in legislating their own moral judgments, and not enough
effort was expended on more immediate student concerns.
The first vote on Miss Red’s candidacy and the plunges into
long range administration affairs such as admissions policy—
a point on which that student questioned the credentials of
the EC-—are lucid examples supporting this criticism. Then
he asked, “Did the EC make a single recommendation con-
cerning the parking problem?”

A bit mundane? Perhaps. But after listening to the EC
last week and all year, perhaps not.

This student also offered some suggestions which the
new EC and class officers might do well to read. He asked:
how many times has any EC member made any effort to dis-
cuss with students in general what they want? How many
class officers called class meetings last year? Or the year be-
fore? Maybe this student is correct in his assessment and
“student government” is a joke. We doubt it, but we can
only speculate: suppose the EC had been less concerned with
acting properly last week.

By Dr. Arthur Scharff
Professor of Romance Languages

Washington & Lee’s foreign study
program has (hurray!) finally been
approved. This arouses misty remin-
iscences in those of us who still re-
main from the line when one’s “pro-
gram” was his determination—or,
nerve—to acquire knowledge, and
not much else. For many of us who
studied abroad in those ancient days
prior to World War II, there is a
certain nostalgia for the times when
“seeking” an education meant just
that. You had to find out where it
was and then seize it while the time
was still ripe.

My first contact with the Sorbonne
consisted of walking into a seeming-
ly deserted, dirty grey building
where the bright sunlight outside
vanished when the door swung shut.
This meeting proved completely
fruitless except for the appreciation
of a few architectural features, It
was only later that I learned that the
concierge’s loge (which always ap-
pears deserted until you pull the
bell cord) was the other place to
buy the Livre d’Etudiant, if one
didn't know enough to go to the
right bookstore—and this one didn’t.

My “orientation program” consist-
ed of running into an American
from Colorado whom I had never
seen before but who had a French
friend who was already matriculated
and willing to take the time to give
us Mark Twain innocents a few
pointers. You bought yourself a
book for a few francs, looked over
the course offerings, selected those
you thought you would like to take
(Prerequisite: the ability to under-
stand what the lecturer was talking
about), and optimistically went over
to matriculate.

Matriculation consisted mostly of
standing in long lines and paying an
infinitesimal fee, about $12.50 at
that time. Up to this point I had not
to my conscious knowledge so much
as glimpsed anyone above the cleri-
cal level, and no one had raised any
objections to anything other than
my handwriting. The days of over-
crowded classrooms and waiting in
the halls to hear lectures were far in
the future. In fact, no one had
shown any particular interest in me
at all.

Later, I learned that the book on
which I had based my choices was
put out by a_ private publisher, and
that the information given in it was
obtained directly from the profes-
sors, who were perfectly free to give
it or not and to change it subse-
quently at will, Academic freedom
applied to the faculty as well as to
the students, Some courses listed
were not given at all; the professor
had changed his mind. Others were
given at another time or another
place; the professor found it more
convenient that way. You might or
might not be notified of these
changes. See what I mean by seek-
ing an education?

The next question to occupy the
prospective student's mind was where
to live and to eat. The University
hardly entered into this at all. The
concierge did keep a list of those
persons who had taken the trouble
to tell her that they rented rooms to
students, but the list was likely to be
a year old and no guarantees were
made. There were Restaurants Etu-

diantins, none of them run by the
University, none supervised by any-
thing other than economic competi-
tion, none particularly good or par-
ticularly generous.

Whether you lived in a mansarde
(originally designed for domestics
who were just short of slave labor)
with a cold water top and an Arab
toilet two floors below, or took one
of the relatively luxurious rooms at
the Cite Universitaire several miles
away, was your decision—and your
pocketbook’s.

The next shock came in realizing
that there were practically no quiz-
zes, no assignments, no attendance
records, and that the professors had
no office hours—not for students
anyhow. If you needed help you
went out and tried to find it. Some
professors were glad to talk at their
convenience, and some you never
saw after they descended from the
rostrum. The only time anyone
other than you knew how you were
getting along in your studies was
after the examinations, which in
most cases took place after several
years of study. You acquired knowl-
edge for a general examination
which covered your entire field, and
sometimes more. These generally
lasted a week or more and many of
them were oral. Language problem?
Yes, there was. It was yours.

Plans Under

By Greg Thompson

David B. Dickens, an associate
German professor who heads the
WAL Foreign Study Committee, has
announced tht final questions con-
cerning the W&L Foreign Study
Program have been resolved. In the
company of Francis Drake, a
French professor, and Jim Williams,
an associate Spanish professor, Dic-
kens will go to Europe to set up
programs in France, Spain, and Ger-
many. The program is planned for
the six-week Spring term.

The Study Abroad Programs will
be listed as French 202, Germas
263, and Spanish 202. The mini-
mum enroliment for each program
will be ten, while the maximum en-
rollment will be limited to fifteen
Each participant must have a cumu-

’

loose, and then it was yours. It
might be that you would be the
only one to know that it was yours,
however. The significant difference
in the situation was the social atti-
tude toward education: it was a pri-
vilege not allowed to everyone. The
University provided it and you
paid, not in cash but in your efforts.

Did anyone care if you didn't get
it? Presumably, you, your family,
your friends and your future em-
ployers did, for it was a great dis-
grace to fail your exams. The Uni-
versity expressed, however, no opin-
ion other than that you had not se-
cured sufficient knowledge to receive
its certification. How you acquired
that knowledge or why you had
failed to acquire it was no parti-
cular concern of Alma Mater. She
was not in loco parentis,

Did you make friends under such
a system? Yes, and sometimes more
firmly because friendships were
founded on your own efforts rather
than mere juxtaposition. There were
student organizations, academic,
political, social and otherwise. None
of them were approved or disap-
proved by the University. The Uni-
versity was not blamed for their
actions nor was it praised for their
achievements. One belonged or not
according to his desires and abilities,
and if the organizbation wanted his
contribution.

The system was by no means per-
fect. The big bugaboo was always

loneliness. No one sought you out
except the prostitutes on the Boul’
Mich. If you did not make an effori
you remained alone, terribly alone.
You were constantly faced with de-
cisions on everything from what to
study (assignments were rarely speci:
fic and where to find the material
was your problem) to what you
could afford for dinner, Failure was
just a step behind you always, Only
you yourself knew how you stood
and you might be wrong. The day of
reckoning was far in the future but
inexorable when it did arrive.

In short, the system had all the
disadvantages of freedom, a boon to
those who were ready for it but a
fatal plunge into the abyss for those
who were not prepared for it or
could not cope with it. Many fell by
the wayside. Isn't that a real life
situation? A University education
was a privilege, not a gift. Only the
fit and the deserving could grasp it
even when it was offered.

Perhaps it is better this way...

The production of Biddle’s new
play marks the third “Spotlight”
production in as many years. Fast
becoming a tradition at the Trouba-
dour Theatre, the “Spotlight” pro-
ductions are one facet of professor
Lee Kahn's effort to encourage stu-
dent participation in all areas of
theatre.

“We don’t just want the students
on the stage,” says Kahn, “We'd like
to offer them the opportunity to try
their hand at making a play as well
as acting in one.”

Biddle’s play, “The Sacrificial
Ram,” presents a panorama of
timely problems, according to the
play's director, David Waelder.
Waelder, a drama major who is di-
recting the show for his senior thesis
production, comments that “the play

In addition, each student must

On The IFC’s Future
lo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

In last week's Ring-tum Phi, an
editorial “Ask Not For Whom The
Bell Tolls” challenged the frater-
nities and the IFC to recognize and
overcome the problems which have
plagued the fraternity system in the
past and which now threaten to des-
troy it.

In response to this challenge, |
will try to show what steps the In-
terfraternity Council is taking to
solve these problems.

Last winter the IFC appointed a
special committee to study what it
felt were the most pressing prob-
lems facing the fraternity system at
Washington and Lee. Under the
leadership of Jim Mathews and
Danny Leonard, the committee re-
searched six areas—structure of the
IFC, social. academics, house con-
struction, laber, and food buying—
in an effort te find ways to increase
the effectiveness of the IFC, lower
the cost of fraternity living and gen-
erally make fraternity life more de-
sirable

The committee's report, which
was published this week, sets up de-
finite guidelines by which frater-
nities can accomplish these ends.

Although the proposals recom-
mended by the committee are too
detailed to mention here, in essence
they focus upon increasing the par-
ticipation and cooperation through-
out all levels of the fraternity struc-
ture. In this way, the sectionalism
and politics, which have impaired
the effectiveness of the IFC, can
hopefully be cast aside.

If and when the Interfraternity
Council adopts the proposals of this
committee as part of its course of
action for next year, they will have
taken the first giant step toward
strengthening the fraternity system
and answering the challenge of the
future.

"A Lack of Respect”

to The Editor, The Ring-tum Phi

The actions of students before the
strike called for today show a com
plete lack of respect for the rights
and privileges of Washington and
Lee students,

Several of my friends posted
hand-made signs on bulletin boards
(approved locations) not on trees,
colonnade walls, etc, calling for
claws attendance today and non-sup
port of the strikers, At no time did
this group remove publications by

other persons advertising their in-
terests, Between the time these were
posted and the arrival of school
custodians Tuesday morning, most
of these signs had been removed!

The obvious conclusion to us is
that although the strikers have a
right to publicity and protest, those
whe oppose them do not have this
right, This is the type of tyranny
that neither radical nor reactionary
should tolerate.

John Motsinger, 1970 C

On Flag Flying

Dear Sirs:

| would like to call attention to a
“minor incident” which took place
yesterday morning. A few friends
and | decided that we would like to
observe the strike by hanging an in-
verted American flag emblazoned
with a “strike fist,” from our sec-
end dorm window, overlooking the
Quad, It was our intention to show
our sympathy and support for the
strike at WAL, by displaying the in-
verted flag, a symbol of national dis-
tress,

The flag was put up about 2:30
Tuesday morning; by 9 a.m. Tues-
day the flag had been taken down
by Dean John and “unknown” stu-
denis,

The key to this “incident” lies in
the manner in which the flag was re-
moved, Dean John appeared at my
room at 9 am, Tuesday morning

be paid in addition to normal tui-
tion for the entire year,”

Prior to the six-weeks abroad,
there will be a campus orientation
period during the week of Spring
vacation. Activities during this per-
iod will include oral drill with the
language, group meals, and informal
sessions after a film.

In the first week of the six week
term there will be a period of for-
mal campus orientation, During this
time, students will be able to plan
their independent projects with their
advisers and continue intensive oral
language drill. Furthermore, partici-
pants will have the opportunity to
hear speakers such as embassy per-
sonnel. Films and slides will be
shown, while language discussions
concerning such topics as foreign
dramatic works will take place.

During his study abroad, each
participant will stay with a foreign
family. There may be some group
gatherings whereby each siudent
would be able to meet the families
of other participants,

Messrs, Williams, Drake, and
Dickens will provide academic sup-
ervision for the programs in Spain,
France, and Germany respectively.
Their specific task will be to super-
vise each student's individual pro-
ject; they would find the necessary
resources for the students’ projects,
A regular class schedule will be set
up for that part of the program
which calls for language work.
Classes will be taught by either a
U.S. faculty representative or a
local professor.

Students involved in the program
will receive six academic credits—
three for language work and three
for project in the case of the stu-
dent who is not majoring in a langu
age. Depending upon the situation,
the appointment of credit might be
changed.

Group excursions such as theatre
visits or even weekend tours will be
included in the program. The pro-
gram will be concluded with a trip
in a section of the country concern-
ed; or a short excursion through a
country of related culture could be
arranged

Participanis will not be consider-

ed as enrolled in a foreien univer
sity, but they will have university
facilities at their disposal, Dickens
stated that it is not known yet which
universities will be part of the pro

gram. That and other details will by
clarified this summer

“Horses”: Another Alienated Hero

By Steve Haughney

There is an odd similarity among
many of the strongest box-office hits
of the past few years. “The Gradu-
ate”, “Bonnie and Clyde,” “Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,”
“Easy Rider”’—all present an alie-
nated hero wandering in search of
an undefined goal while practicing a
life-style outside the bounds of an
equally undefined American way of
life.

It is evident that the American
film industry is making a lot of
money by playing on hopes and
fears firmly entrenched in our minds.
Most of us still believe that the
“pursuit of happiness,” the search
for utopia, is an inalienable right;
but most of us also feel that Some-
thing, be it the Establishment, the
Communist conspiracy, or Mr. Ag-
new, bars the way.

“They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?”
offers a variation on this theme. The
scene is California, the Land of Op-
portunity, in 1932 with the Depres-
sion at its worst. Michael Sarrazin,
who plays the wandering hero, en-
ters a marathon dance contest hop
ing to win the $1000 prize and with
it respite from the starvation which
threatens him.

The contest, from the preliminary
medical examination to the final
shuffle around the dance floor, is by
no means the ticket to security and
freedom that Sarrazin and the rest
of the contestants had hoped it
would be, But in spite of the fact
that the contestants are treated like
cattle, they continue to believe that
“prosperity is just around the cor-
ner,” that they can “make it” if they
just hold out long enough.

Gig Young, who plays the contest
announcer, is free of this delusion
and realizes that the contestants are
being used to stage a spectacle so
that those who come to watch can
feel relieved that someone is worse
off than they.

Young deserves his Oscar for a
standout performance in a role that
is far more exciting than his usual
portrayal of a sophisticated bon
vivant, Sarrazin and Jane Fonda,
who plays his dance partner, are
very convincing as they gradually
come to understand the futility of
their hopes and the cruel facts of
their situation.

Even Red Buttons performs well,
as shocking as that may sound. The
acting in general saves the movie
from becoming just another story of

The camera work is not of the
spectacular variety as Director Sid-
ney Pollack strives for realism rath-
er than the sentimentality which can
plague movies on this theme.

The final demise of Sarrazin and
Fonda is inevitable, but nevertheless
shocking and disheartening for their
utopian dream is only that they be
allowed to survive. But it is the un-
specified “they” of the title which,
predictably, has that luxury. “They

depressing movie, but it is worth
seeing even if the story is a familiar
one.

By Greg Raetz

Each spring the Washington and
Lee campus goes through a rather
unsightly metamorphosis. Granted
the dogwoods bloom, the trees and
grass become green, and the air is
fresh and warm, but the natural
beauty and the dignity of the colon-
nade, in particular, and the campus,
in general, are blighted nonetheless.

The blight is due partly to the un-
savory appearance of some of the
student body and faculty, and partly
to their unbecoming habits. One
eyesore is the sunbathing that goes
on in front of the colonnade. There
is nothing wrong with sunbathing
per se, but it seems that those who
chose to lie out in the sun could
find a more appropriate place.

The beauty and dignity of The
Hill should not be marred by these
white, half naked, and haphazardly
strewn forms. Aren't these heliola-
tors just as guilty of pollution as the
junkyard dealers who own the old
cars that are rusting on hillsides
around the country?

There are other daily occurrances
on The Hill which deserve some
criticism. For example, the sight of
professors throwing what appear to
be brass balls around the lawn is,
to say the least, eye-catching. Again

Stn Boole...

Through A Spyglass, Darkly .. .

The Beauty Of Spring

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

the criticism is not so much that
professors are throwing balls around,
but rather concerns the areas they
have chosen to throw them. There
are places for athletic activities just
as there are locations for sunbath-
ing. The place, however, is not The
Hill.

These criticisms, and many more
which could be made, may seem
petty. They would be except that
they indicate a fundamental defici-
ency in all too many people on this
campus. A sense of dignity is lack-
ing.

Five years ago conventional dress,
the speaking tradition, and walking
on the pathways (Alas, now we have
sunbathers and ball players) were
honored traditions. Today they are
all but dead. Some faculty now even
refuse to wear coat and tie. As tradi-
tion has declined so has our sense
of dignity.

The depths to which these ideals
have fallen can be illustrated by a
statement that can be attributed to
our student body president-elect. At
a fraternity house during the elec-
tion he informed the somewhat
startled and appalled membership
how great it felt not to wash or
change clothes for four days. It’s
funny how the new left calls the
establishment pigs.

   

 

Hoffman’s Almanack

By Betty Munger
Manager, W&L Bookstore

I have a queasy feeling that this
week is going to be one of those
time/place points, like Pearl Har-
bor, Dallas, Birmingham and Chic-
ago. No one needs to date them—
just locate them. What better time
to stop and listen, really listen, to
one of the wilder spokesman for the
militant young people. I have just
finished reading “Revolution for
the Hell of It!” by Abbie Hoffman.

Abbie Hoffman was born “with
the gift of laughter and a sense of
the world was mad.” The art of the
put-ons an acute sense of the liv-
ing uses of theatres have been used
by Hoffman to dramatize his opposi-
tion to our materialistic society.

He has succeeded beyond his
wildest expectations. In a technolo-
gical age, with machines to do the
work, everything should be free—
FREE. Abbie has gotten hundreds

of thousands of dollars of television

master of manipulation of the news
media. Some wild antics—he calls
them creativity-and the cameras
zoom in on him.

The very title of the book is part
of the put-on. Revolution, yes, but
let's have some fun while we're do-
ing it, he says.

A series of short articles com-
prise the bulk of the book—dating
from back in March 1967-covering
some of the more flamboyant hap-
penings that Hoffman was involved
in. The pages are liberally sprinkled
with obscenities, but if this upsets
you, score a point for Abbie.

Some of the early writings seem-
ed dated to even a “middle class li-
beral” like me, but when he reaches
the days and nights of Chicago, the
book takes on a intensity which
brings the sights and smells and
sounds of Lincoln Park into the
room. Grass and LSD have roles in
Hoffman's impromptu life play (pun
intended,) and property is held in
total disrespect.

Make no mistake about it—be-
hind the cut-up is a very serious

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

By Jim Hooker

Washington and Lee finally has
a team that each individual, whether
he knows the game or not, can and
should be proud of. In a game
which was packed with emotion
both in the stands and on the field,
we were treated to a brilliant display
which has brought our team from
the mediocrity of their spring per-
formances to the status of one of
the top teams in the nation.

There was no doubt that UNC
came here to destroy the high flying
Generals. They have an All-America
attackman in Harper Peterson who
they can always go to in the clutch.
They have the winner of the 1969
Nation’s Outstanding Goalie award.
They are ranked eighth in the na-
tion while we are mentioned in the
top fourteen. We were seeking stat-
us and respectful acceptance for
what had shaped up to be one of
the finest trigger happy stick groups
to ever grace our institution.

But then like a nightmare, the
Tarheels from the South swarmed
all over us, seemingly without
mercy and exuding in confidence.
After all, they had beaten or rather
systematically demolished the same
Towson State team we had lost to
11-7 by a 12-0 count.

The first half was like a rude
awakening. North Carolina was to
be a large stepping stone, With na-
tional recognition in the balance,
WA&L seemed to lack the business-
like professionalism that they had
shown in previous trials.

Carolina took advantage of this
and quickly jumped off to a 1-0
lead. All of a sudden everything
seemed gloomy. We had needed to
score first to get things going. Every-
one seemed to be wary of the power-
ful Carolina team which had lost to
Maryland by only 10-8. Minutes
later, however, it was all tied up
by a bouncing slap shot off the stick
of senior crease attackman Tom
Groton.

But for the Generals that was all.
North Carolina led by Kramer,
Peterson, and Seipp turned it on.
Our bad breaks and misplays fur-
nished them with enough opportun-
ity to go ahead by a 6-1 score. It
was Kramer, however, who must be
cited for the unbelievable job he
did in the goal. Kramer held the
team together. He made saves on
shots that should have been scores.
He slowed the game down on clears
and literally led his team from one
end of the field to the other. He dis-
played all of the qualities that have
made him the best and then some.

When the field was cleared for
half time, there was a silent mur-
mur which ran throughout indicat-
ing an attitude of defeat. The score
stood at 6-1 and yet we had outshot
them 20-16. What had gone wrong?
The most important game of the
year seemed out of reach. The fans
seemed to be only staying on as a
token gesture for the team which
had come from a 1-8 record last
year to what was a 7-1 record be-
fore Saturday afternoon.

The team came back prepared,
though. With Morrill, whose mid-
field could be one of the best if not
the best in the nation led the Gen-
erals stunning second half come-
back on a low right handed bullet
rifled into the lower right corner of
the goal with an assist from fellow
middie Chip Tompkins. Suddenly,
the invincible Kramer, who had
been elevated in everyone's eyes to
semi-god, was found to have a weak
point: he could be scored upon.
Tompkins came right back from his
feed to pick up a goal on a Scott
Neese assist.

Entire third quarter play was
dominated by the Generals. The ball
hardly managed to change ends of
the field. What must be noted here
is the outstanding job that Bill
Brumback did on Peterson. Brum-
back was all over Peterson, never
once leaving his side. With their

biggest gun in check, Carolina’s of
fense seemed to lack the position
and firepower to generate any kind
of scoring to thwart the oncoming
Generals. The third quarter ended
with W&L taking six close shots a!
most in succession at the tenacious
Kramer.

The fourth quarter has to be as
exciting a period of play as could
ever happen in modern sporis. Tom
Groton dropped in a quick one
through the middle from Scott Neese
who was doing a brilliant job of
getting away from his defenseman.

Then Sam Englehart, the Mary-
land scoring ace who had been held
scoreless to this point, got in the
act by firing a Slauson feed into the
corner. He did not stop here how-
ever. Minutes later, on another pa-
tented shot, he poured in the tying
goal. The Generals were on fire,
and it seemed as if no one could
stop them, Then the unbelievable
happened.

Neese, rolling back and forth be-
hind the goal, finally circled it and
fired the go-ahead goal with less
than four minutes left to play. It is
unfortunate that the game could
not have ended here. Carolina was
too good a team to fall part in the
clutch, Peterson, whose whole day
had been made miserable by the
shadow of Bill Brumback, fired a
rocket past Bill Ingersol. On the
play, Peterson was flattened by
Brumback and had to be taken from
the game. Then it happened.

Carolina scored the final goal
with 1:19 left to play. The crowd
which had been hysterical through-
out the game fell silent. And when
it ended, the crowd stood not to
leave but to cheer the two teams.

It would be unfair not to men-
tion the unheralded contributions

the most exciting players there is to

Generals Off To Sewanee
To Bring Back CAC Bell cu

On Thursday, the Generals travel
to Sewanee to take up the last leg
in CAC competition. Presently,
W&L is a hair's breath behind
Washington University and has a
substantial lead over the other con
tenders. “At this point, it’s a two
way race for the Conference Bell,”
said Gene Corrigan. ‘We've got to
be tough to defeat Washingior in

gan. If everything goes well, the

Canfield’s tennis team is expected

they have a strong home course ad-
vantage. After two early losses, the
team has been playing well and feels
confident that it will improve on last

It will take a collective effort by
all teams to win the overall honors,

Goshen Classic Set;
Free Beer Provided

“Tubing,” or shooting rapids in
inner tubes, has long been a popular
sport at Washington and Lee. In
fact, one might almost call it a tra-
dition. This year, the Fourth Annual
Goshen Classic White Water Tubing
Contest will be held on Saturday,
May 9 at 2 p.m. at Goshen Pass on
the Maury River.

This year there will be three
events: the President’s Trophy Race,
Open to any member of the W&L
faculty or administration; the Pow-
derpuff Sweepstakes, open to all
females; and the Downriver Grand
Slalom, open to all male students
attending NCAA colleges.

Last year, entries ranged from

Virginia schools to the University of
Kansas. Unfortunately the Powder-
puff Sweepstakes had no entries and
the only entry to the President’s
Trophy Race was disqualified. But
in the Downhill Grand Slalom, com-
petition was intense, as Herald
Bowes (SPE) won the event with a
time of 32:15, followed by Bill Wil-
son (Lambda Chi) with a time of
33:03. Lambda Chi won the team
title with a combined time of 68:18.
Runner-up was SPE, compiling a
70:00 time.

Prizes to be awarded this year
will include a swimsuit, a McMullin
blouse, and a teakwood ice bucket,

On Flag Flying

(Continued from Page 2)
with the “students.” He attempted to
wake my roommate who, having
spent most of the night helping to
prepare the flag, was unable to be
stirred.

Dean John then instructed the
“students” to remove the flag,
which they did, ripping the flag “ac-
cidentally,” in the process. It was at
this time that another student, the
actual owner of the flag, came back
to the dorms. He was informed by
Dean John that the “owner” (of the
flag) was aware of the Dean’s pre-
sent actions. The owner, Dean John
was referring to was my roommate,
whom he had failed to awaken.

The fact that Dean John errone-
ously assumed that, since the flag
hung from our room, it was ours, is
excusable, The fact that he proceed-
ed to remove the flag without the
supposed owner's permission is inex-
cusable.

Dean John agreed with us on the
dubious manner in which the flag
was taken down. When the four of
us involved discussed the matter
with him, he apologized to us for
his method, and cited three reasons
for his actions:

1) Since inverting the flag might
be considered desecration of the flag,
hence a violation of the law, he re-
moved it himself to avoid having
police on campus.

2) He informed us that early
fuesday four or five students said
to him that if the flag was not re-
moved, they would “tear it down
themselves!” He further mentioned
that another small group of students
had gone to Dean Pusey on this
same matter. He felt that by remov-
ing the flag himself, he would avoid
an “incident” between us.

3) Finally, he indicated that he
himself felt that the use of the flag
was in poor taste and showed a lack
of descretion.

Perhaps the flag. as a symbol of
protest, is wrong. However, let no
one be deceived into believing that
the flag flying “properly” over
America today represents the views
of a united, satisfied country.

contacted Dean Lewis John in at-
tempt to clarify the citation of sev-
eral facts in the above letter. Dean
Jobn informed us that be had two
courses of action to take in the face
of veiled student threats of reaction
to the flag's display: he could have
either called the local police to in-
vestigate the matter, which he felt
would have probably resulied in an
arrest of a student, or he could have
the flag in question removed himself.
He told The Ring-tum Phi that he
had instructed the custedians of the
fresimen dorms to oversee the rest
of the posters in the area to insure
that they would not be destroyed.
Concerning the matter of the flag's
owner, Dean John stated that he
made what he considered a valid as-
sumption at the time: the flag dis-
played in the window belonged to
the resident of the reom.)

men. The closed discussion came
about after Dan Silberberg present-
ed some tentative plans to the EC.

After Silberberg presented his
plans to the EC, Dean Kumpuris
asked Tom Gillespie what he did.
Gillespie said that this was the first
time he had heard of Silberberg’s
plans. He said he had made sugges-
tions to Silberberg earlier in the

Law School Elects Slay;
SBA Chooses Hartmann

Rising senior law student Jim
Slay, campaigning as a “hard-line”
defender of the honor system, was
elected Monday morning as senior
law school representative to the EC.

In other elections, rising senior
Rob Hartmann was chosen to suc-
ceed Bev Read as president of the
Student Bar Association for the
coming semester. Tom Baker was
elected vice-president of the SBA,
and Jack King was picked for the
position of treasurer. Jim Philpott,
the only rising second-year man
elected to office, won the contest for
secretary.

Slay, a 1965 WA&L graduate, led
a field of four candidates on the
first ballot and defeated Bill Walker,
who expressed a qualified interest in
proposals to modify the honor sys-
tem penalty, in a runoff. Speaking
before the vote, Slay strongly sup-
ported the present system and said
that if the student body were to
weaken it, he would be in favor of
establishing a separate honor system
for the law school.

President-elect Hartmann has
been president of his class for two
years in a row. He was a member
of this year’s regional champion
Moot Court team, and is presently
working for the W&L Law Review.

Also voted on at Monday's elec-
tion meeting were three proposed
amendments to the SBA constitu-
tion. The association agreed to
change the membership of the Board
of Governors and to tighten control
of SBA funds, but rejected an
amendment which would have pre-
vented ex officio members of the
Board from serving as elected of-
ficers at the same time.

year, but that Silberberg had brush-
ed them aside. “There is a com-
munication gap,” admitted Silber-
berg.

Silberberg asked the EC for a
$300 summer budget. He was not
exactly sure how it was to be spent,
as there was no 1968 budget from
which to work.

Henberg denied Silberberg the
money until Silberberg and Gillespie
could present a more organized plan
as to responsibility and organiza-
tion. At this point, Gillespie said “I
don’t want to start a floor fight. It’s
been an unhealthy situation all year
because of throat cutting; we've
been working under the assumption
that one of us would be bagged at
the end of the year.”

Kumpuris requested that the re-
sponsibility be divided between the
two and some decision reached by
by the EC next week. Silberberg
said, “If you think you can run it
with two chairmen, that’s just
dandy.

In closed session, the EC decided
to allow Silberberg to retain the
position of Chairman, and to ap-
point Gillespie as head of the Steer-
ing Committee, as Silberberg had
earlier suggested.

race with 94 votes, but faces a run-
off with Bob Carrere of New Or-
leans, (81), Don Weir of Shreve-
port, La., (62), and Moon Yee of
Toledo, Ohio, (53).

Sophomore President Mike Mc-
Call, also a candidate for re-election,
polled 79 votes to 44 for Steve
Hawley of Oxtord, Ohio who will
compete with him in a runoff. Wade
Peery, (37 votes), David Dale (33),
and Lloyd Wolf, (12) were the other
primary candidates.

Steve Robinson of Alexandria
was re-elected Vice President of the
Class of 1972. Robinson had 107
votes to defeat Ned Moore of Coral
Gables, Fla. and Dave Harbert also
of Alexandria.

Craig Jones of Greenville, N.C.
led four candidates into a runoff for
two rising sophomore EC positions
in the race that drew the largest
number of candidates.

Jones. who had 98 votes will be
joined in the primary by Tom Mays
of McClean, Va. (77), Archer Frier-
son of Shreveport, La., (74), and
Class Vice-President Jeff Burris of
Indianapolis, (64).

Rick Gray of Dallas will serve
his second term as Class President
next year. Gray polled 107 votes to
win outright election over Grey Dye
of Silver Springs, Md., (47), Carl
Crowley of Atlanta, (35), and Jeff
Southmayd of Bethesda, (27).

Gary Poliakoff, from Spartanburg
held the lead in the Vice-Presidential
primary. Poliakoff, who had 98
votes, will face Greg Robertson of
Staunton in the runoff. Drew Sta-
niar, Ed Tognetti, and Steve Priest
followed Robertson in that order.

EC Reverses On Ann Red Case

(Continued from Page 1)
Markham’s question prompted Dean Kumpuris to com-
ment, “I think we're going about it all wrong. Shouldn't
what we're doing be like the Supreme Court—inter-
preting the constitution we have here?”

Markham replied, “I want to try to get away from
‘Supreme Court interpretations.’ He added that stu-
dents in the exchange program were not asked “to
come here enthusiastically” and that “we have got to
have as many girls here as possible” if the exchange
program were to be “viable” on campus. Concluding his
defense of Monday night's ruling, Markham stated that
a “higher integration” in the exchange program would
be achieved if the EC were to allow any “girl who
wants to come up here to school to run for office.”

Drew Kumpuris picked up the argument with Mark-
ham over interpretation by commenting, “I don’t think
that if we don't let her run, coeducation will be set
back five years. It’s all a question of interpretation of
the constitution—if we get loose with that, we'll get

loose with everything else.”

Markham responded, “If you just want to sit here
in a vacuum and discuss the constitution .
remarks were cut off by Kumpuris’ reply, “That's just

what I want to do.”
After several other opinions had

basically reiterated these points, Drew Kumpuris asked,
“Do you think that when the constitution was written,
it was intended to mean that a person who was not a
member of their class could run for office?” Markham

W&L Glee Club
Hosts Goucher
In Lee Chapel

Sunday afternoon, May 10, at 3
p.m., the Washington and Lee Glee
Club will present a joint concert
with the John A. Graham Brass
Choir and the Goucher College
Glee Club in Lee Chapel.

The concert will feature two mo-
tets by Giovanni Gabrieli; or “Sacr-
ed Symphonies,” as the composer
called them, Each is for an eight
part chorus, brass ensemble and
continuo, These works are products
of the brilliant choral tradition that
developed at Sit. Mark’s Cathedral in
Venice in the seventeenth century,
and they demonstrate the vast
sounds and textures that are typical
of this style.

answered, “They probably didn’t want freshmen to
drive cars either, but times change.”

Finally, a motion was made to end discussion and
Prater presented his motion stating in effect that ex-
change students could not run for office in the student
body due to conflicts in the constitution. Andrews sec-
onded this motion, but then Markham moved to table
the motion indefinitely, and
tabling motion was soon withdrawn so that the ques-
tion could be decided.

Before the vote was taken, Henberg remarked, “It’s
unfortunate that we don’t have a full EC at this time.”
Thompson commented, “We, as the EC, assume respon-
sibility for all we do. It would be more irresponsible
for us not to overturn the motion if we feel we made a
mistake only to try to prevent from castigating our-
