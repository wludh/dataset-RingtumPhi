Student Role Increased
On Faculty Committees

The Washington and Lee faculty
undertook reform of the Student
Affairs Committee and gave a vote
to the student member of the fac-
ulty Executive Committee in what
Dean of the College William W.
Pusey termed a “full” meeting
Monday night.

The SAC reform was one of sev-
eral motions proposed by the com-
mittee itself and passed by the
faculty. The current voting mem-
bership of seven faculty members
and four students will be changed
in September to five members of
each group, in accordance with a
recommendation by the — student
Executive Committee.

A representative of independent
students—the president of the Inde-
pendent Union if possible—will be
added, and an associate dean will

 

be dropped as a voting member.

A representative of the University
Center Committee will be made
an ex-officio member of the SAC
in order to increase communications
with the center, according to Lewis
G. John, dean of Students.

No ex-officio members
permitted to voie.

Acting on another SAC proposal,
the faculty abolished grade require
ments for fraternity initiation and
left new stipulations to the discre-
tion of the individual fraternities.
Faculty regulations concerning house
parties were abolished and control
given to the Interfraternity Council,
which is expected to consult Lex-
ington residents before taking any
action,

Rules concerning eligibility for
student offices were also changed.

The Washington and Lee Chapter
of Phi Beta Kappa has elected 28
new members. The list contains 18
seniors, five juniors, one law  stu-
dent, three members of the class of
1969, and one honorary member,
whose name will be announced later
in the year.

The seniors are from 16 different
states. They are as follows:

David McLeod Bethea, an Eng-
lish major from Newport News,
Va.;

Roger Franklin Cook, a philoso-
phy major from Pine Bluff, Ark.:

David Harris Dake, an Honors
candidate in sociology with a major
in history as well, from Monroe,
Conn.;

James George Dickinson, a politi-
cal science major from Richmond
Heights, Ohio;

Robert Lee Entzminger, an Eng
lish major from Belle, W.Va.;

Henry Arnold Fleishman, a chem-
isiry major from Anderson, S.C.:

Marvin Charles Henberg, a major

The faculty made a 2.0 cumulative
grade-point ratio the only academic
requirement.

The faculty gave Dave Bethea,
the student member of the faculty
EC, a vote on all matters except
those in which the committee acts
for the faculty between faculty
meetings. This had been recom-
mended by the faculty EC after the
student EC made a similar recom-
mendation earlier in the year,

The faculty also passed a pro-
posal by the faculty EC offering a
major in religion beginning in
September and another abolishing
the two-week prohibition on away
athletic events before exams.

Dr. Edgar Spencer, professor of
geology, was elected to a _ three-
year term on the President’s Faculty
Advisory Committee. He succeeds
Dr. William Buchanan, professor of
politics, whose term has expired.

A resolution was adopted noting
the faculty's “sense of profound sor-
row and loss in the death” of Pro-
fessor William Chaffin and recogniz-
ing his numerous accomplishments
at Washington and Lee.

Discussion on two controversial
matters — university regulations on
absences and eligibility requirements
for extra curricular activities—were
delayed until next week due to lack
of time.

University President Robert E. R.
Huntley called a special meeting
of the faculty for Monday, March
16, at 4:30 p.m. to discuss these
topics.

An amendment proposed at Mon-
day’s meeting from the floor calling
for the elimination of all absence
regulations is expected to be the first
order of business at that meeting.

A faculty EC meeting is also
scheduled for next week.

EC Fills Vacated Post;
Reviews Admissions Plan

By Steve Ory

The Executive Committee elected
Drew Kumpuris to fill the junior
executive committeeman post vacat-
ed by the death of Kevin Baker.
Kumpuris, a junior from Little
Rock, Ark., was elected from a field
of eight applicants and was sworn in

immediately prior to the regular
business meeting.
A discussion of the Admissions

Report was prefaced by Glenn Azu-
ma, who stated that the study called
for a shift in emphasis from SA!
scores to high school performance
as admissions criteria. Azuma felt
that this did not call for a lowering
of admissions standards for the Uni-
versity.

Objections to the report came
from Dean Kumpuris, Chuck Dob-
bins, and John Markham, who ques-
tioned the reduction in graduation
requirements for underprivileged stu-
dents,

Markham commented thai a fe
duction in graduation requirements
would prevent underprivileged stu
dents from being judged as equal
with regular students

Dave Bethea and Glenn Azuma

 

Ihe Pips appearing March 21 in Dorenws C5 aenasion,

defended this section of the report
by noting that it would be necessary
for the deprived students to assi-
milate successfully into the Univer-
sity. This could not be readily ac-
complished, according to Bethea
and Azuma, with the normal course
load.

John Richard addressed the EC,
calling for a definition of what ex-
actly the EC meant by underpri-
vileged students. Richard also noted
a contradiction between the attempt
to prevent a reduction in standards
und the imposition of varying dist:
bution requirements for special stu
dents

Joe Tompkins proposed that the
Dance Board Vice-President be
elected in a general student body

According to Tompkins, the quali-
fications for the Vice-Presidency
would be that a candidate be a ris

Dance Board Advisory Council.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, March 11, 1970

Noblesse Oblige

If the Executive Committee next week
approves as it now reads the Committee Re-
port on the Recruitment of Underprivileged
Students, they would be making a decision
which could be fatal to Washington and Lee
and psychologically destructive to the under-
privileged students involved.

The sub-committee which authored the
report vigorously denies that any lowering
of admissions standards would be entailed.
They claim rather that the impersonal ob-
jective admissions criteria now used attend to
only middle class standards and hence are
unfair when applied to underprivileged
classes. They recommend substituting new
admissions criteria—such as personal inter-
views and class rank—which would examine
individual potential on a more subjective
basis.

However, the report in its later pages
openly contradicts their assertion that admis-
sions standards would not be lowered. The
report outlines a special summer program
and a special transitional year policy for
these students. Included in the transitional
year are provisions which we can only de-
scribe as academically absurd. For example,
“the students will attend regular classes
and receive credit if a passing grade is at-
tained. Failure in a course will result in the
non-registration of credit rather than a fail-
ing grade which will endanger his standing.”
Or, “The hours (for graduation) require-
ment could be altered from 123 to 117
for transitional year students.”

The glaring dichotomy in this report that
strikes us is: if admissions standards are not
being lowered but the emphasis is merely
being shifted, as Mr. Glenn Azuma phrased
it, “to place the value of SAT scores in their
proper perspective and to move to more
valuable forms of testing,” then why have an
insulting transitional year program and why
have relaxed graduation requirements if
these underprivileged students being sought
are presumably capable of maintaining pres-
ent expectations of Washington and Lee stu-
dents? Evidently, Mr. Bethea and Mr. Azu-
ma lack the faith and confidence in their new
admissions policy they grandiloquently as-
sert exists.

Besides the danger to admissions stand-
ards of switching to a policy that ignores the
necessity of familiarity with certain academic
tools which enable competition with “W&L
students” by “W&L students’’, consider the
psychological danger to students from lower
socio-economic brackets by this noblesse ob-
lige attitude.

The “we are going to treat you different
because you are different” attitude of the re-
port can only make these men feel more
miserable. And we sincerely believe they will
be miserable from the beginning anyway be-
cause of their social and economic situations.
Washington and Lee is an expensive school.
It is expensive on and off the campus. To
bring here a small number of underprivil-
eged students—who had to be recruited—is
as cruel to them as placing a guinea pig in an
observation tank for 1400 pairs of eyes to
stare at, and no one likes to be stared at.
Washington and Lee is a school for snobs,
but it’s a good school academically nonethe-
less because we realize this and we cater to
this in all areas.

But the noblesse oblige attitude of ac-
tively recruiting underprivileged students to
come here is selfish, the most odious expres-
sion of snobbery. The report admits this on
page one. However, the report does have a
second motivation, far more noble. This is
the ideal of offering a good quality educa-
tion to students who might not otherwise have
the opportunity. There is to be sure nothing
selfish in that. However, it is neither the ob-
ligation nor the responsibility of a private
institution to undertake this noble burden.

First of all, we simply and pragmatically
cannot afford it. Second, as we hinted above,
it is not fair socially to the students involved,
or academically to those same students, to
our faculty, and to our other students.
Third, public institutions more diversified
and less expensive exist for the express pur-
pose of offering anyone in their tax base a
good education. It would indeed be wonder-
ful if we could aim ourselves in this new di-
rection, but we truly feel it would be more
prudent and fair to all concerned to concen-
trate on our admissions problem from an-

other angle. R.HLY.

A Real Deferred Rush

The difficulty in both of the so-called
deferred rush proposals now before the In-
terfraternity Council is that neither of them
lives up to its name. What they are, in fact,
are deferred pledging programs which ad-
here only to the letter and not the spirit of
the faculty directive to reform the system.

The chief difference between the two lies
in the restrictions placed on contact. The ori-
ginal plan, submitted by Chuck Cahn, Danny
Leonard and Jim Mathews, places minimal
strictures on rush tactics during the six-week
prepledging period. The argument is that,
while there might initially be an “escalation
of irresponsibility” in competing for the
freshmen’s time, the work load would soon
restore an atmosphere of “naturalness’” in
which the freshmen and the fraternities
could then make a rational decision. Leo-
nard suggested that to provide such a rea-
soned choice would deprive fraternities only
of the “dead wood” who contribute little to
fraternity life anyway.

The alternate proposal, presented Mon-
day by Lawrence McConnell, takes a more
skeptical view of the possibility of a maturity
that rush history has failed to produce, and
it therefore places more stringent restric-
tions on contact between fraternity men and
freshmen. Such a plan would, it apears, in-
sure more equality among fraternities and al-
low more time for academic concerns to pene-
trate the mental cloud cover rushing would
have built up. It also deals more reasonably
with the financial exigencies involved. That
is, removing dead wood inevitably results in
financial losses which would prove fatal to
several houses, while it is likely that more
freshmen would pledge under McConnell’s
plan,

The problem is that neither plan pro-
vides for the possibility that an intellectual
atmosphere will develop before everyone is
absorbed in a sox ially oriented decision struc:

ture which is at best peripheral to the univer-
sity’s major concerns. The second plan, it is
true, is closer to the ideal, but it is still seri-
ously remiss in meeting the responsibility
fraternities must have to recognize and serve
the primary goals of the institution. We need
hardly mention the intellectually deleterious
effects cloistering freshmen will create.

Alternatively, the first plan relies on as-
sumptions which lead to undesirable possibili-
ties. Proponents say first that maturity, not
irresponsibility, will escalate, but if that does
not happen, and we cannot understand the
optimism that it will (particularly when it
may appear that the alternative to irrespon-
sibility is immediate extinction), then those
houses that most adhere to the goals of the
university community will disappear. If,
however, it is the freshman who is first re-
pulsed by incessant rushing, then his rejec-
tion is likely to be not merely of one frater-
nity but of the whole system.

It would seem, then, that both from a
philosophical and a practical point of view
the IFC should choose to establish a true de-
ferred rush, probably one beginning second
semester, This adheres to the faculty direc-
tive in spirit in that it provides for an as-
similation into the university's academic as-
pects, and for a general adjustment to the
college environment, before another distract-
ing, and ultimately less important, experi-
ence is undertaken. We further believe that,
without any kind of rush structure first se-
mester, the institutional impetus for imma-
turity and artificiality would be lacking and
fraternities would indeed assume that na-
turalness both factions consider necessary
for a rational decision to be reached. Ad-
mittedly, there are practical problems pre-
sented here, too, the most notable one being
financial, but the difficulty does not appear
insurmountable. At least wom san honest at-
tempt at reform. R.L.B,

Two Rush Plans Offered
On Contact During Rush

By Reeve Kelsey

The question that the IFC is fac-
ing this year—as last—is that of
contact—should there be unlimited
contact or structured, controlled
contact between the fraternities and
the freshmen. There are two plans
before the IFC for consideration.
The first, proposed by Chuck Cahn,
Danny Leonard and Jim Mathews,
is basically one of unlimited con-
tact. The second plan, introduced at
Monday's IFC meeting by Lawrence
McConnell, is one of limited con-
tact with rush in a structured con-
text.

The Cahn-Leonard-Mathews pro-
posal is obviously the more ideal
and utopian of the two plans. It
puts great faith in both the fresh-
men and fraternities to adapt quick-
ly to a new set of circumstances.
The plan, simplified, allows each
fraternity to rush as it sees fit. The
drawbacks to this plan are, however,
overwhelming. Given the intense,
one week rush period, which is the
heritage that the fraternities will live
with for the next few years, it is
almost impossible for the frater-
nities to make the transition to the
low-keyed, informal approach which

Move Underway Asks,
Abolition of Faculty?

Considering the fact that through
the vigilance committee it was learn-
ed that several Freshmen in college
did not know the star players of the
football team, it was deemed useless
to give any list of the faculty, who
are naturally not so well known as
the members of the football squad.
Rather than have the unsuspecting
students mistake the faculty list for
the membership list of Alpha Sigma
Sigma, it was thought best to give
some explanation in regard to the
excuse for the existence of such an
organization and also in regard to
the part that the faculty plays at
W.N, L.

Practically every college and uni-
versity in the country has at present
some kind of faculty. The custom
was begun in the dark ages and be-
came so well grounded that even in
modern universities where a large
and competent student body exisis,
there is always a faculty representa-
tion, although there may be no ap-
parent reason for it. Naturally a
leader, W. N. L. could not afford to
be behind in the matter, and conse-
quently has kept pace with the move
ment.

The prerequisite of W. N. L. fac
ulty members is a speaking know!l-
edge of golf and a respectable set of
golf sticks. Under the full professors
there are associate professors whose
only requirements are one golf stick
and an enthusiastic interest in the
subject. The instructors in each de-
partment have as their sole duty
attendance at the local golf matches
and payment of the golf club dues
The assistants who are subservient
to any one of the above-mentioned
authorities, are responsible for the
real work, which consists of estimat
ing class grades and calling the roll
at the laboratory hour. Owing to
the fact that the golfers of Lexing
ton have formed the habit of play
ing only in the afternoons, a sched
ule of classes has been drawn up in
order to provide some form of di
version for the professors during the
morning hours; attendance al these
classes is optional

The faculty at W. N. L. occupies
a father unique position, which
comes as the natural result of the
existence at the University of the
famous and feared animal, the au
tomatic mule, This animal is kept at
the University to awe the students
into a submissive state of mind and
to impress upon outsiders the rigid
requirements of the curriculum. i
is the duty of the faculty to keep
i close eve on the delinquent stu
dents at the end of each term, and
in case any poor unfortunate com
im sich chose prosimily to the an

mal as to he laul low, io inmned

ately set the fallen member on his
feet again. The restoration of the
fallen is accomplished by means of
grades on which the mule thrives in
a State of contentment. Consequent-
ly, when an assistant makes an error
in interpreting the grade curve, it is
the duty of the professor to raise
the grade to the degree required for
the appeasement of the animal. This
action is compulsory only in case
the student so requests—otherwise.
it is optional.

There is a movement on foot to
abolish the faculty entirely, but so
far the student body has remained
totally indifferent towards the mat-
ter.

is the only context under which
the Cahn-Leonard-Mathews proposal
can work,

First, fraternity houses are open
to the freshmen at all times. From
purely geographic terms, this puts
the outer eight fraternities at a com-
petitive disadvantage from the start.
Secondly, as Hal Catlin argued at
the Monday night meeting, there
are no restrictions on fraternity
combo parties—allowing for com-
bo-escalation with many fraternities
attempting to create the image of
‘the social’ house.

Although not quite as extreme as
the previous proposition, the obvi-
ous rush strategy for any house
would be to maintain a positive con-
tact with a given freshman on a
daily basis—always offering him a
little more than the next fraternity.
Give him the opportunity to go
down the road as much as he wants.
Make sure that he has a good time
at your fraternity every Friday and
Saturday evening—the basic objec-
tive would be intense rush and pres-
sure for the first one or two weeks
until he unofficially pledges.

With two, three, or four houses
applying the same basic strategy on
any given freshman, the escalation
in time, effort and money is inevit-
able. Danny Leonard suggested that
after a few days or weeks of this es-
calation, both the freshman and the
fraternity will realize that this is
really nonsense and give up the high
pressure technique. But will they?
Will not rush success ultimately go
to the house that can maintain this
type of daily contact?

The restriction in contact is not

Sazeracs’ Schedule To Include
Palm Beach Trip In The Spring

Outside of occasional appearances
at Evans Dining Hall during Par-
ents Weekend, concerts at an occa-
sional student organization's con-
vention, and a rare tour of frater
nity houses, the average WAL siu-
dent has little chance to hear the
Sazeracs, Washington and Lee's
singing fraternity, as the Calyx de-
scribes it.

Of course, this might be due to
the fact that as far as the Lexing
ton campus is concerned, this is
about all the Sazeracs do. Bui the

According to Van Pate and Tom

social engagements (both members

From The J-School...

 

Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

As the Administration All-Stars
head south for spring training, one
important player will be missing.
Spiro “Spiker” Agnew, the All-Stars’
hard-hitting right fielder, is holding
out for a large raise.

In making his demand, Agnew
pointed out that he was voted
M.V.P. of the Southern Association
last year, beating out three time
winner George “Whiffer” Wallace.
Agnew’s clown act while playing
right field has also made him a
great crowd pleaser.

All-Star Manager Richard “Tricky
Dicky” Nixon said he knows Agnew
is a valuable member of the team,
but added that Agnew has presented
the team with a non-negotiable de-
mand. Asked what he plans to do if
Agnew does not sign for the com-
ing season, Nixon said the right
field job would go to Margaret Mit-
chell, a second-stringer the last two
years. “Margaret has performed well
when she has played and I’m sure
she can do the job as a regular,”
the manager said.

 

Agnew an All-Star Hold-Out

Agnew said his salary demand is
not unreasonable because he is more
than just offensive. “I did a great
job defensively last year against
such opponents as the Washington
Post, the New York Times, and the
NBC Peacocks.” Agnew claimed
special credit for driving Peacock
slugger Chet “Hawk” Huntley into
retirement. “With Huntley out of
the lineup, we can pitch around
Brinkley and they won’t hurt us.”

Agnew also claimed that his sa-
lary demands have the support of
the great silent majority of fans who
come to games but do not protest
when their team loses.

Nixon denied rumors that there
is a fued between him and his star
player due to Agnew hitting on his
own, rather than waiting for a sig-
nal from the bench. “Let me make
this perfectly clear,” Nixon said,
“there is nothing personal between
Spiro and me.”

Agnew denied published reports
that he is after Nixon’s job, and
blamed the reports on an unsym-
pathetic press.

_ ‘Earth Catalogue’ a Rare Item

By Betty E. Munger, Manager,
W&L Bookstore

In the summer of 1968 a veteran
of Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters
loaded 40 books and assorted mer-
chandise into a 1963 Dodge Camper
and toured Nex Mexico’s communes,
dispensing tools and practical ad-
vice to the settlers. This “Truck
Store” proved so successful that
young Stewart Brand set up a mail
order operation in Berkeley, Cal.
The first printing of his Whole Earth
Catalogue is now a collectors item.

Called by “Time” magazine “a
sort of Sears-Roebuck Consumers
Report the minorities of the cyber-
netic age”, the Whole Earth Cata-
logue’s stated purpose is to offer
access to tools for the individual “to
conduct his own education, find his
own inspiration, shape his own en-
vironment, and share his adventure
with whoever is interested”.

The most recent edition of the
catalogue (Jan. 1970, with a press
run of 60,000 copies) is an over-
sized paperback of 128 pages selling
for an almost unpaperback price —
$4.00. It is already hard to come by.
Here, we have sold 45 copies and
have 30 more on order.

The Whole Earth Catalogue in it-
self is a ticket for a mind-expanding
trip into worlds of creativity. From
Stalking the Wild Asparagus to
The Effective Executive — some-
thing for everybody. Road-side
camping? building an adobe house?

, Symposiums at Sweet Briar and Hollins
Favored in Poll Wi] Cover Black Man and Literature

Panel discussions and _ literary
prizes will highlight symposiums at
Hollins and Sweet Briar colleges
this coming week. The tenth annual
Hollins College Literary Festival
will be held Saturday, while Sweet
Briar will sponsor a program on
“The Black Man’s Role in Ameri-
can History and Society” March
19-21.

For the first time prizes of $100
each for poetry and fiction will be
awarded for the best poem and
short story submitted at the Hol-
lins Festival. The awards are being
made by “The Hollins Critic,” a
journal of criticism published by
Hollins College five times a year.
Winning works will be selected pre-
ceding the festival and discussed,
with other outstanding poems en-
tered, by a panel composed of poets
Howard Nemerov, Daniel Hoffman
and Richard Dillard. Entries have
been made by college students in
Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee
and Alabama.

Highlighting the festival will be
a panel on current literary trends
which will be composed of Louis
D. Rubin, Jr., Hoffman, Robert
Scholes and Walter Sullivan, and
moderated by John R. Moore. The
festival will close with a lecture
concert, “Rock Poetry,” by J. C.
and the Blessed, a rock band headed
by Hollins English graduate stu-
dent, John Currier.

Be

buying a used airplane? Yoga? At-
las Shrugged? It’s all there, ready
to be ordered.

In between the regular spring and
fall catalogue issues, Mr. Brand
publishes two supplements a year,
which update information and which
spread out into what is called “the
difficult but possible.”

The Whole Earth Catalogue may
very well have a limited life span.
Mr. Brand plans to stop publication
in 1971. “If by that time there aren't
people and ideas around doing a
better job than we have, then we'll
have failed”, he says.

Dr. Rubin is a professor of Eng-
lish at the University of North Caro-
lina. He headed the Hollins English
department from 1957 to 1967 and
founded, with Dr. Moore, “The
Hollins Critic,” of which Hoffman,
Scholes, Sullivan, Dillard and Ne-
merov are all contributing editors.

The Sweet Briar symposium will
feature national leaders in educa-
tion and religion and exponents of
black culture participating in a
three-day program of lectures, panels
and group discussions.

The symposium will provide a
forum for review of the history and
accomplishments of the black race,
and for discussions relative to the
co-existence of black and white peo-
ple without regard to color. Both
the problems and the opportunities
of the Negro in today’s society will
be explored.

Dr, Channing Emery Phillips will
deliver the keynote address at the
opening session Thursday evening,
Mar. 19. He will speak on “The

cert, and an exhibit of African
sculpture will be on display through-
out the meetings.

CAC Salvages Hardcourt Season

The 1969-1970 basketball season came to a thrilling close
last week with a College Athletic Conference championship.
The Generals finished 17-8 overall.

Washington and Lee opened the season on the road and

lost 57-56 to Randolph-Macon. De-
spite Mike Neer’s 17 points and 17
rebounds, the Generals were victims
of turnovers.

The Generals broke into the win
column, trouncing Bridgewater, 102-
87. Mike Daniel went wild, scoring
28 points against the hapless Eagles.

W&L resumed winning ways by
conquering highly-touted Rollins
84-62. This was a very strong win

contributed 19 points and Neer add-
ed 18 rebounds.

Hampden Sydney was the next to
fall, 86-56, as “Magic Mel” Cart-
wright put in 25 points while grab-
bing 22 rebounds. Neer added 15
points and took in 18 rebounds.

The Generals derailed Lynchburg

for 21 and 20 points respectively.
Neer also patrolled the boards for
20 rebounds in a game which was
marked by a fine defensive effort by
Ellie Gutshall.

Lehigh’s Engineers felled the Gen-
erals 85-71. Floor mistakes marred
the W&L effort despite Cartwright’s
20 points. Gutshall added 16 points
and Neer had 14 rebounds, but it
was not enough.

The Generals concluded the 1969
portion of the schedule by defeating
Centre, 91-78, and then Wofford 73-
63 to win the Washington and Lee
Invitational Tournament. Neer had
18 points and Cartwright 17 against
the Prayin’ Colonels. Against Wof-
ford, Cartwright got 25 points and
grabbed 16 rebounds while Neer
added 20 points. Both were all-
tourney choices.

W&L defeated Alma 67-59 be-
hind Cartwright’s 19 points. Neer
and Daniel contributed 15 each to
the cause.

Scrappy Virginia Commonwealth
overcame a fine performance by
Neer to beat the Generals, 90-83.
Neer tossed in 12 points while col-
lecting 17 rebounds,

The Generals bounced back to

overcome Navy 70-56. This second-
half victory came on the perform-
ances of Daniel, (16 points), Neer
(14 points), and Cartwright, (14
points). Gutshall once again led a
hand-cuffing defense.

Emory and Henry fell 82-52 as
Cartwright canned 25 points and
Neer grabbed 16 rebounds. The
Generals tight man to man defense
continued to cut off the enemy scor-
ing effort.

The Generals won again topping
Belmont Abbey 92-64, Cartwright
had 23 points and 19 rebounds
while Daniel poured in 22 points.

WA&L edged a fired up Hampden-
Sydney squad 76-72. Cartwright,
with 23 points and 22 rebounds, and
Neer, with 22 points and 16 re-
bounds, combined with another fine
defensive effort paved the way for
the victory.

Baltimore’s 70-66 victory was the
Generals’ fourth setback. Although
Neer dropped in 18 points and made
off with 27 rebounds, the Generals’
offensive show was lacking.

W&L battered Lynchburg 105-
60, as Daniel tossed in 23 points
and Neer grabbed 19 rebounds.

After a successful completion of
the regular swimming season —
compiling a 5-2 record with a sec-
ond in the Virginia Intercollegiate
Swimming Championships and an
overwhelming victory in the CAC
championships — Coach Stearns is
preparing with a three-man squad
for the college division NCAA
Swimming Championships. Captain-
elect Bill Brumback, Bim Clark,
and Alan Corwith have begun work-
ing for the championships which
will be in a week and a half.

Brumback who earned All-Ameri-
ca status along with Billy Ball last
year will be entered in the 50 and
100 yard freestyle events. Last year,
Brumback’s final time of 22.40 sec-

Coach Pleased With |
‘70 Baseball Outlook |

By BOB LaRUE

Although basketball has just
ended at Washington and Lee, the
baseball season is just around the
corner, as Head Coach Joe Lyles
has been schooling some 29 pros-
pects since early February.

“We got a good start indoors
with our pitchers, the best headstart
since 1 came here,” commented
Coach Lyles. “We also have more
depth than ever before.”

The Generals lost only three
starters from last year’s 12-8 squad,
which returns nine lettermen. Al-
though sophomore letter-winners Bill
Greener and Bill Miller are the
only remnants of last year’s pitch-
ing staff, the pair is accompanied
by six new faces to the mound.
Freshman Bill French, Tim Haley,
Haller Jackson, and Bruce King
have all been impressive. Coach
Lyles also plans to employ first
baseman-outfielder Ray Coates and
knuckle-baller third baseman Steve
Kalista in relief roles. Possible dark-
horses are senior Don Bock and
freshmen Don McMillon and Ralph
Smith.

Mainstay senior Jack Baizley will
once more start behind the plate,
while freshmen Greg Robertson and
Bill Greener will battle for the
number 2 position.

The rest of the infield is fairly
set at second and third, as co-cap-
tain John Nolan holds down the
keystone and Steve Kalista handles
the hotcorner.

sophomores Fred Paone and Jack
Robinson for first base. Although
Hall represents some much needed
left-handed hitting, Paone is tre-
mendously improved over last year.
Coach Lyles is “very happy” about
the fierce competition among the

candidates for shortstop. Sophomore |
transfer Ellie Gutshall, junior Rich |

Murray and freshman Steve Flu-
harty are all working hard at that
position.

Co-captain Scott McChrystal re-
turns to lead an outfield which
boasts four lettermen and three
strong freshman hopefuls. Junior
Ray Coates, moved from first base
to center field, is fighting senior
Chris Coursen for a picket job.
Junior Ed Bohannon could make the
scuffle even more interesting. In left,
sophomore Bob LaRue is competing
with freshman Murray Smith, and
another freshman, Dave Traylor is
working hard behind McChrystal in
right.

Overall, Coach Lyles is very
pleased and posses and unmanager-
like optimism towards the season.
“If we continue to improve, we'll
have a fine club. Everyone is work-
ing hard.” Coach Lyles noted the
efforts of co-captains McChrystal
and Nolan for their extra work with
the team.

In preparation for the opening
of the season, the Generals will take
on neighboring V.M.I. Friday and
Saturday in inter-squad action.

was too strong.

WAL seemed to be in a rut as the
Generals lost again, this time to
West Virginia Tech, 85-70. Neer
turned in another fine performance
with 19 points and 19 rebounds,

The Generals got back on the
right track by stomping Davis and
Elkins, 107-80. Cartwright scored
17 points and Daniel and Stu Fau-
ber scored 14 points apiece.

Fairleigh Dickinson toppled WAl
76-69. While most of the Generals
were cold, Neer put in 23 points
and grabbed 17 rebounds

WAL closed its regular season
with an 87-71 victory over VCU in
Doremus, and headed for the CAC
Tournament in St. Louis. Fauber
led the Generals over Centre, 93
66. A closing 83-69 victory over
Washington University broughi the
Generals their 17th win and the
conference championship.

Youth and Maturity
Winning Package,
Coach Szlasa Hopes

By DAVID TORRANCE

It is advantageous for any athletic
team to have young players, but it
is also necessary that a team’s mem-
bers be experienced. Youth and ma-
turity, two key factors for any team,
are incorporated into this year’s la-
crosse squad,

Led by two seniors, Jay Meri-
weather and Ned Coslett, the team
is gaining even more experience by
their pre-season scrimmages. In
yesterday’s scrimmage with the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, which held
second place last year in the Ivy
League, goalie Billy Ingersoll, a
junior, did an excellent job for the
Generals even though the Generals
lost. On March 16 and 17, the team
scrimmages last year’s Ivy League
champions, Yale. When the actual
season begins, there will be no rea-
son for lack of spectator support, as
there are only three games away
this year.

The defense this year, led by
captain Ned Coslett, third team All-
American last year, has a great
deal of depth. Returning lettermen
from last year are sophomores Tom
Smith and John Larmour and
junior Frank Stearns. Bob Radcliff,
on last year’s B-squad, will be re-
turning also. Several freshmen are
fine prospects: John Rogers, Donny
Eavenson, Towson Brown, Ed Mc-
Laughlin, and Jim Salmons.

The midfield will have much
more depth than in the past, with

RABE OIL

Jay Meriweather and junior Whit
Morrill, who was second team all
division last year, Also returning
from last year are senior John
Thomas, junior Bob Jantzen, re-
covering from an injury, and sopho-
mores Mark Skoggard, Todd Morrill
and Jim McCone. Freshmen ex-
pected to play a great deal will be
Chip Tompkins, Sam Englehart,
Tim Winfield, and Ed Tognetti.

The attack includes senior Tom
Groton, most improved on the
squad, and sophomore Scotty Neese,
leading scorer last year. Competing
for the third attack position are
freshmen Bob Brumback, Hank
Slauson, and Mott Lamotte.

With the scrimmages, the team
continues to get stronger so that
it will be ready for its first game
against Goenseo State on March 26.
Although one of the better teams
in New York, it has only four men
returning from last year. The game
will be here at 2:15, and Coach
Szlasa would appreciate as large a
crowd watching as possible. Later
on in the season, the Generals will
battle Towson State, one of the
stronger teams in their division,

This year, for the first time, there
will be a weekly national and reg-
ional ranking.

The Generals this year should
have a strong team. But Coach
Szlasa says that he has been dis-
appointed in the past by the lack
of spectator support.

PREECE ESSEEESEEEE CET TESS

Deferred rush was the Interfra-
ternity Council’s prime considera-
tion again this week, although dis-
cussion on the matter took place
after the formal meeting.

A proposal prepared by Lawrence
McConnell was presented to the
IFC committee meeting as an alter-
native to the Cahn-Mathews-Leo-
nard plan.

The McConnell plan restricts con-
tact between fraternity men and
rushees and provides for a structur-
ed seven week rush. The Cahn-Mat-
hews-Leonard proposal which was
presented last week does not restrict

contact and allows for what Danny
Leonard called a more “informal”
rush,”

The main problem for the IFC
is the preparation of a workable
plan which resolves the issue of con-
tact during next year’s deferred
rush. The proposals will be discuss-
ed at next week’s meeting.

In response to last year’s motion
for the IFC to aid in financing the
stay of two Kenyan students for
four years, a drawing was held to
determine which two houses would
feed and house the students. Kappa
Alpha and Pi Kappa Phi were se-
lected.

A drawing was also held to deter-
mine who would keep the exchange
student from Finland for next year:
Delta Tau Delta was selected. A
third drawing was held to deter-
mine which two houses would have
cocktail parties for a speaker com-
ing to the campus later in the year
from Sierra Leone; Pi Kappa Alpha
and Sigma Phi Epsilon were s¢
lected,

Scholarship certificates from sec-
ond semester last year were given
out to six fraternities: Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Delta Upsilon, Zeta Beta
Tau, Phi Epsilon Pi, Sigma Phi
Epsilon, and Lambda Chi Alpha.

Several announcements of impor-
tance from the faculty meeting were
made at the meeting. The faculty
has delegated to the IFC the power
of determining the necessary grade
point ratio for fraternity initiation.
The IFC has yet to decide whether
it will determine the necessary GPR
or leave it up to the individual
houses. The faculty has also relin-
quished the power to determine the
number and hours of fraternity par-
ties. The faculty stressed responsibi!
ity in determining when and how
man parties fraternities should hold,
and urged the IFC to take into con
sideration the town and the Uni-
versity.

More indirectly affecting the fra
lternities is the faculty decision to
revise the composition of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee. Next year,
the SAC will be equally composed
of five members from the faculty
and five from the student body.

Cartwright Wins AP Honors

Mel Cartwright, who was just
named the Most Valuable Player in
the College Athletic Conference, re-
ceived honorable mention in the
Little All-America basketball team

named yesterday by the Associated
Press.

The Little All-America team is
named annually by the AP to honor
small-college players.

Dr. Colvin States Cut Policies

Dr. Milton §. Colvin, professor of
politics, has announced that students
in his B-hour Political Science 214
class will be allowed only three ex-
cused absences for the remainder
of the semester.

Noticing a decrease in class at-
tendance since the beginning of the
second semester, Colvin has issued
a statement to students in the class
on “Conduct of American Foreign
Policy.” The text of his message is
as follows:

This comes by the way of intro-
ducing myself to those members of
my eight o'clock class in Foreign
Policy whom | have not yet had the
pleasure of meeting, though many
of them asked my personal permis-
sion to take the course,

HEAR YE ALL MEN: As of the
printing of this notice, members of
the class will be permitted a total of
three excused cuts for the balance

winner of the Phi Beta Kappa sopho-
more award and a chemistry major
from Scarsdale, N.Y.;

Joseph Buford Tompkins, Jr., a

Va.;

William Clement Wilkinson, a
psychology major from Ft, Eustis,
Va.

The law student elected is Leigh-
ton Summerson Houck, a Hampden-
Sydney graduate from Lynchburg,
Va.

In addition to these, three magna
cum laude graduates of the class of
1969 were elected. They are Robert
Irving Dunbar, Cincinnati, Ohio:
William David Ferraraccio, Blue-
field, Va.; and Alan Mare Le Vine,
Hawthorne, N. J.

The new members were elected
by the Gamma of Virginia Chapter
of Phi Beta Kappa at its annual
business meeting Monday evening.
They will be initiated April 11 after
the annual Phi Beta Kappa-Society
of the Cincinnati Convocation.

Phi Beta Kappa was founded at
the College of William and Mary in
1776 to recognize and encourage
scholarship and cultural interests.
Qualifications for membership are
excellent scholarship, liberal culture,
and good character.

Kelsey Analyzes
Rush Proposal

(Continued from Page 2)
designed to preserve any of the
artificial nature of the present rush
system. It is merely a guideline that
outlines what is considered a legiti-
mate rushing activity and what is
not... When rush can be held and
when it cannot. The restrictions are
designed to keep rush within rea-
sonable financial limits and to limit
the demands placed on the time of
both the fraternity member and the
freshman.

It has been argued that such re-
strictions are unenforceable. If the
fraternities are not even able to
follow a set of regulations, how can
they possibly be mature enough to
Operate intelligently under an un-
limited contact system? The restric-
tions and their enforcement provi-
sions are designed to protect the in-
dividual fraternity from the excesses
of its competitors

In conclusion, given WAL's heri-
tage of intensely competitive rush,
it is impossible for the fraternities
to adapt to an unlimited, unstructur-
ed rush over night. For the long
run preservation of the stability of
the fraternity system and the short-
run stability of student life at Wash
ington and Lee, it is inyperative that
the IFC adopt a deferred rush plan
that incorporates the basics of the
McConnell plan: 1) restricted con-
tact and 2) structured rush

of the semester. Any student who is
absent without excuse for the third
time will have his absence privileges
officially removed with no official or
unofficial remorse on my part for
the attendant penalties.

I had originally intended to serve
notice that I would drop the course
unless attendance improved, but it
is clear that such a policy would be
unfair to those now attending.

But students should reflect that
an understanding of the five-day
week was that students would honor
eight o'clock classes. If students
abuse that understanding, then per-
haps a second look at the five-day
week is in order.

s/Milton Colvin

Cartwright, a 6’5” senior forward
from Martinsville, Va., has received
many awards for his playing in his
four years on the Washington and
Lee basketball team.

He was named an All-College
Athletic Conference player in 1967,
1969, and 1970. In 1968 and 1969
he was given the Most Valuable
Player award at the W&L Invita-
tional Tournament. He made honor-
able mention on the Little All-
America team once before, in 1970.

As a senior on the Martinsville
High School basketball team, Cart-
wright was named a High School
All-American and the Most Valu-
able Player on the school’s 1966
state championship team.

During his four years with the
Generals Cartwright played 97
games, scoring 1800 points for a
career average of 18.6 points per
game. In his senior year he made a
school record by making 120 as-
sists. During his career he made
over 52 percent of all field goals at-
tempted.
