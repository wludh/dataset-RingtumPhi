Goralski Talk to End Contact;
120 Girls Here For Co-ed Week

Washington and Lee’s sixth an-
nual Contact symposium will end
tonight with a speech by Robert
Goralski of NBC News on “Tele-
vision: Keeping the Government
Honest.”

Tonight's program will conclude
a week-long presentation of discus-
sions and lectures centering on the
overall theme of “Communications
in the Modern World.”

Goralski, 41, has traveled in some
35 foreign countries and has cover-
ed five wars as part of his journalis-
tic work. He joined NBC News in
Washington nine years ago, and
since then he has been assigned to
the White House, the Department of
State and the Pentagon.

He is a frequent contributor to
the “Huntley-Brinkley Report” and
the morning “Today” program. Go-
ralski regularly writes the section
on Vietnam for the Encyclopedia
Britannica “Yearbook” and he is a
reviewer of books on current events
for the Washington Post.

Before joining NBC News, Go-
ralski was chief of the Burmese Serv-
ice of the Voice of America. He has
lived in Asia six years, having been
employed also by Radio Free Asia
and the Asia Foundation. While in
Pakistan, he helped establish that
country’s first school of journalism,
at the University of Karachi. A na-
tive of Chicago, Goralski was gradu-
ated from the University of Illinois
in 1949, majoring in political sci-
ence and journalism.

Approximately 120 girls took part
in Contact as part of Washington
and Lee’s first Co-ed Week. The
girls, representing Hollins, Mary
Baldwin, Randolph-Macon, and
Sweet Briar, took part in undergra-
duate classes, dined at Evans Hall
and at fraternity houses, and served
on panels in conjunction with Con-
tact programs.

Former Attorney General Ramsey
Clark cited two “wasteful, harm-
ful” dialogues in his Tuesday night
discussion of crime and unrest in
the United States.

“There is a need for more than
preaching,” he said, in discussing
the first dialogue, “respect for the
law.”

He went on to depict the prob-
lems of today’s urban life and the
poverty-ridden backgrounds of ghet-
to youth. He urged reforms and
told the large Lee Chapel audience
that “we will have respect for law
only when people have rights.”

Clark also denounced the second
dialogue, “repressive measures as
cures for crime.” Pure repressive
measures are to a large extent in-
effectual, Clark said, citing the slim
percentage of convictions of report-
ed crimes.

Moreover, by devoting vast funds
to “pure custody” rather than to re-
habilitation, the nation is, Clark
feels, failing to eradicate the per-
sonal problems that are often the
real reason for crime.

In closing Clark cited the dic-

Victorious Debaters
Continue to Travel

Washington and Lee debaters will
continue their travels this weekend
by participating in two tournaments.

John Reynolds and Ken Murov
will travel to the United States
Naval Academy for one tourna-
ment, while Charles Smith and Bill
Radigan will represent Washington
and Lee at Kings College in Wilkes-
Barre, Pa.

Other debaters took first place
over the weekend in a major inter-
collegiate debate tournament spon-
sored by the University of Rich-
mond.

Winning top honors for Washing-

m and Lee were Tim Wright, a
junior from Houston, Texas, and
Kevin Baker, a junior from Lynch-
burg, Va.

Thirty-five colleges and universi-
ties competed in the tournament,
which was held last Friday and Sat-
urday in Richmond.

To win, Washington and Lee's
team defeated Boston College in the
semifinal round and St. Anselm's
College of Manchester, N. H. Both
are considered to be national powers
in debate. Other major institutions
falling to WAL included Wake For-
est and West Point.

Baker also won the honor of be-
ing declared the third best indivi-
dual speaker of the tournament, and

The debate topic was: “Resolved:

Washington and Lee also won
high honors in the novice debaters’
division of the University of Rich-

freshman from Houston, and Andy
Bradshaw, a freshman from Norge,
Va., teamed to place second in the
division,

hotomy that exists for many between
order, on one hand, and justice, on
the other. Clark urged that these
forces be instead combined. “You
can have neither order nor justice,”
he said, “unless you have both.”

Following the speech, Clark join-
ed in a panel discussion with stu-
dents, faculty members and indivi-
duals in the audience. A variety of
topics was discussed, including in-
tegration, which Clark termed “im-
perative,” Vietnam, and citizen in-
volvement with the police,

On Wednesday afternoon in Lee
Chapel, Ted Powers, Roanoke tele-
vision personality and editorial wri-
ter; discussed “Censorship in the
Broadcasting Industry.”

Although censorship in “the classi-
cal sense” is not a factor in the
United States, the broadcast indus-
try often falls prey to self-censor-
ship Powers said.

Such conditions arise both from
a lack of set standards and from the
influence of advertisers, who find
that it is “often possible to exercise
powers of censorship on the stations
they are sponsoring,” he said.

Powers also answered questions on
cable television, the quality of
shows now on the air, the potential
Specialization of individual televi-
sion channels, and the potential of

Last night in Evans Dining Hall,
Contact presented Harold Hayes,
the editor of Esquire magazine, and
William Rusher, the publisher of
National Review.

Hayes, dealing with one of the
themes of his publication, “Dubious
Achievements,” stressed the rapid
pace of events in the sixties, and ex-
pressed a concern that the youth
movement may be losing some of
its earlier ideals and is becoming
infested with vested interest.

Rusher's speech, “The Impact of
Modern Media on Student Unrest
and Dissent,” stressed conservative

viewpoints on a broad range of
topics. He also expressed a skepti-
cism concerning the usefulness of
today’s college education and a
“wait and see” attitude toward to-
day’s youth.

During the question and answer
period which followed the speeches,
Hayes was queried on lowering the
voting age and on his opinion of
The National Review. Rusher en-
gaged in a spirited dialogue with
audience and panel members on
Vietnam, marijuana, and pollution.

In addition to outside speakers,
five Washington and Lee professors
conducted afternoon seminars as
part of the Contact program. A

Concert Guild presentation by The
Beaux-Arts String Quartet was also
part of the program for last night.

Co-ed Experiment

The effort a small group of people put into one week of
seminars and lectures is rewarded only by the degree to
which their attempt to enliven the intellectual atmosphere
succeeds. With this as the measure, the CONTACT com-
mittee and especially Chairman Larry Honig have a right to
feel a large degree of satisfaction.

The Ring-tum Phi has in past years advocated that the
CONTACT program move away from a political science-
economics-sociology orientation into other areas. Although
that editor had in mind an occasional program on the humani-
ties, we find the creativity that conceived Co-ed Week to be at
least a significant gesture in the direction of providing CON-
TACT with greater variety and scope, and we support the
effort. Especially worthwhile is the use of CONTACT funds
to experiment in matters the University is considering on a
theoretical basis.

Without the benefit of complete retrospect, we judge
CONTACT to have been a success in both aspects of its en-
deavor to stimulate intellectuality here. First, of course, the
speakers have been entertaining and thought-provoking,
and their subjects of major interest to most students to whom
the program is available.

Second, in regard to the co-ed experiment, the success,
while perhaps not quite as measurable is, we believe, real.
We must immediately qualify that statement. We cannot re-
gard this temporary inclusion of women into W&L’s acade-
mic life as a true test of the viability of co-education. In the
first place, the campus has since Monday assumed an air of
artificiality. Class attendance has increased, and everybody
seems to be dressing a lot better than is normally the case.

Further, class participation in some cases seems to have
taken on the characteristic of the war of the sexes and in other
cases has resulted in closer attention to one’s classmates than
to the subject at hand.

The difficulty, of course, is that one week, especially one
in which the work load is a bit lighter anyway, is not long
enough for the situation to normalize. Our only prediction is
that, given the time, dress habits would revert (though per-
haps not quite all the way) and class would once more be-
come a place in which to give primary attention to the acade-
mic material at hand.

Yet the contribution some classes have received due to
the presence of women in them convinces us that the experi-
ment as a means to test co-education is not totally invalid and
indeed seems to indicate that there are advantages accruing to
the idea.

At any rate, whatever bearing this experiment has on the
question of whether to make W&L co-ed, we hope that its
experimental nature will become a permanent part of the
CONTACT format, and that its implications for the possibil-
ity of more communication and cooperation among the
schools in the area will not go unheeded, either by student
groups or by the administration.

Parkin g A Problem

The additional influx of cars into Lexington this week in
conjunction with the co-educational program has served to
underscore a problem that is of major concern to many in
the Washington and Lee community.

With gym construction to begin shortly and the relaxa-
tion of restrictions on automobile possession formerly im-
posed on freshmen and financially assisted students, parking
at Washington and Lee is rapidly becoming a very perplex-
ing problem.

We are all aware of the great deal of emphasis recently
placed on the immediate need for new facilities; notably re-
furbishing and increasing the size of the present gymnasium,
constructing a new library, and constructing additional, if not
entirely new, facilities for the School of Commerce. Seem-
ingly overlooked in determining needs however, have been
allowances for immediate additional parking. Moreover, in
light of the planned construction, a reduction of present
parking facilities seems probable.

Roughly half of the students presently eligible to possess
cars do so. If this percentage is applicable to freshmen next
year, and we have no reason to believe otherwise, we can ex
pect a minimum of 700 cars.

Present facilities from the front of Doremus Gymnasium
to the VMI border provide parking for some 290 cars, with
additional space behind the gym for 120 cars (reduced to
50 after construction).

Long range plans call for a maximum of 300 additional
spaces in various proposed lots ranging in location from the
vicinity of Lee Chapel to across the ravine. Part of this plan-
ning is in compliance with certain local ordinances which re-
quire a specified ratio of parking spaces to the seating capa-
city of the new gym.

The Ring-tum Phi is aware that the cost of additional
parking facilities is extremely prohibitive (Roughly $1,000
per space for asphalt facilities). But we would hasten to point
out that the problem is a most pressing one, and one that,
rather than simply relegated to a priority on the University’s
long range plans, deserves the immediate attention, and ac
tion, of those who seek to better the physical facilities of the

Law and Order:

By Dave Olson

Fuesday night before an overflow
audience in Lee Chapel Ramsey
Clark gave what I thought was an
intelligent and perceptive speech on
the problems of violence and crime
in America.

Mr. Clark introduced some very
important and often overlooked
points concerning these problems.
He stated that we need respect for
the law in this country and he also
stated that a series of repressive
laws “tendered as a cure for crime”
is a dangerous way to look at the
problem. In other words fear will
not inculcate respect for the law it
will inculcate fear of the law. Re-
spect. Mr. Clark said, will come
only if everyone has rights in this
country. As he said, this society is
in bad shape when we have to de-
pend on the police for order.

The road to stopping violence
and crime in this country as Mr.
Clark said is to rework the social
fabric in this country. In particular
we must rebuild and rework the
ghetto for that is where the majority
of violence and crime has its be-
ginnings. But why does it come
from the ghetto? It comes from the
ghetto because the conditions in the
ghetto are such that crime, like a
cancer, has the needed decay, social
and physical, to grow and spread.
Violence and crime are symptoms
of decay in the social fabric. As Mr.
Clark said we must rebuild the
social fabric so that there can be
respect for the law.

Mr. Clark feels also that some of
the blame for violence in this coun-
try stems for police overreaction in
many cases. He feels that we need
to educate and train police much
more extensively. Also we must pay
them more so that it will become an
attractive profession,

The problem of violence in this
country is one of a cause-effect re-
lationship. The cause of violence in
this country is a decaying social fab-
ric. The effects are an open disre
spect for the law (particularly in the
ghetio) and If we enact re
pressive laws we may stop riots,
prostitution and drug addiction in
he ghetto but the causes of the

rimes will remain. The way to e!
ninate the crime is to eliminate the
which are unlivable condi
tions of the ghetto. Overt police ac
tion will not solve the problem. Ur-
band renewal, improved education,
and greater opportunities and
will be, the correct ways to elimi
nate the causes and the effects

[hen we can say with understanding
fal valulity Fespeci ily liw

By Lawrence McConnell

For various reasons, many may
call former Attorney-General Ram-
sey Clark’s speech Tuesday evening
in Lee Chapel the highlight of Con-
tact. Perhaps his appearance can be
called Contact's high point primar-
ily because his remarks were the
most significantly disturbing of any
made this week.

He spoke on the topic “In What
Sense ‘Law and Order’?” and out-
lined two ordering forces of society
in the United States which he felt
were harmful or “at least wasteful”:
(1) the need for respect for the law
and (2) the series of repressive mea-
sures which are used as deterrents
for crime.

Proceeding to defend his opening
statements, he noted that Lincoln's
statement, “reverence for the rule of
law should be the religion of the
country,” could not be applicable in
today’s society. He remarked that
he hadn't seen the “human spirit”
which could say to a black man in
a ghetto, “respect the law.” Turn-
ing to the matter of deterrents to
crime, Mr, Clark felt that repressive
deterrents were not the answer to
the overwhiming problm of crime
and that what is really needed is the
rebuilding of the “brutalizing” en-
vironment in which crime is known

 

Pro and Con

to be rampant. By altering and im-
proving this environment in which
crime most frequently occurs, Clark
said, the problem of crime can
greatly reduced in America. Thus,
the principles of respect for the law
and repressive measures to enforce
the law are not the real keys to
crime prevention.

In large measure, by failing to re-
fine and define issues about which he
was speaking, Mr. Clark has made
some very dangerous implications.
First, he did not note any distinction
between obedience and respect for
the law. Very basically, one might
say that the orderly government of
a society depends upon the resigna-
tion of that society's individuals to
obey rules established to order that
society, Simply, this obedience ts
characterized in the individual's
sense that if he does not obey these
laws, he gets anything from a crack
on the head to a fine in court, de-
pending upon the society.

Respect for the law is not as
easily definable as obedience. Here,
reverence for the law is established
through the individual's sense of
morality and perhaps more basically,
his corresponding reverence for the
ethics of his religious faith. Respect
for the law then, must be seen as
more of a reverential cultural out-

thing with you this week. I'm sure
there's some of us that have even
shared your rest rooms with you
(there seems, quite understandably,
to be a shortage of women's rest-
rooms on this campus which means
careful regulation of your intake of
coffee and beer)

Im sure at first there was a
little discomfort and apprehension
on both sides. My very first nine
o'clock of the week was a Sociology
class which a lot of girls attended,
and the poor instructor walked in,
saw all these females and said, very
heartily, well, we won't talk about
fertility today anyway. | would have
thought it the ideal situation myself
However

The first fraternity | went to I
think must have been a little uneasy
too. Dinner went like this. The
housemother met us at the door,
took our coats and then brightly
introduced us to the boys. For the
next fifteen minutes the art of small
talk was desperately cultivated, And
just when everyone's siock was runn
ine dry, when everyone had asked
everyone else what they were major
ime in, where they came from and
how they were enjoying Contact, the
bell rang. We swarmed towards that
dining room as if it were our only
hope of salvation

When the meal was over, the
bovs sat around talking to the boys,
and the girls saw there was nothing
for it but to make conversation
with the girls (what a bore). Bul a
few extrovert spirits came and talk

night greeted us in a solid bloc of
shirts and ties. But the guy I sat
next to at dinner had on jeans and a
sweater and could easily have used
his shirttails as a napkin.

“Excuse me for not being dress-
ed,” he said, a little defensively.

“Oh, that’s quite all right,” 1
said.

“If you're going to have a natural
atmosphere, you should dress na-
tural,” he said with conviction.

“I quite agree,” | said.

The next morning | bumped into
a friend. A girl in faded tattered
Bermuda shorts had just walked
past us. The first thing he said wasn’t
Hi, how are you, but “Did you see

wiches and coke, and especially fun
listening to Ted Powers.

Ah weil, back to the conven's

growth, while obedience is merely
an understanding of the penalties
for offense against society, and a
subsequent adherance to the law.
Thus, order in society can be ob-
tained in two ways, either by sim-
ple obedience to the law or by a
refined respect for what the law is.
Thus, Mr. Clark is saying that we
cannot demand a culiural response
from people in an uncultural en-
vironment—a statement with which
everyone will agree. But why can’t
society require a simple obedience
to the law from everyone, cultured
or uncultured, when the consequ
ences to violations are plain?

When Mr. Clark referred to Lin
coln’s remark that “reverence for
the rule of law should be the religion
of the country,” he did not make
any reference to the context in
which Lincoln said those works
Lincoln was speaking of law as an
absolute, unbending, steadfast con
cept whereby everyone is judged
equally. In practice, Lincoln's con
ception of law is not widely accepted
in the United States today. A! pres
ent, it is “old fashioned” to thin!
of law as unmovable—now it is
thought of as a viable code of reg
ulations created to meet society’
needs. And it is this latter concep
tion of the law which Mr. Clark
chose to defend.

Evidence for Mr. Clark’s assump
tion of this modern attitude towards
law can be found in the very con
tent of his speech. Instead of speak
ing about the problems of law en
forcement (which was the function
of his office as Attorney-General),
he proceeded to talk about how
crime can be prevented by improv-
ing the environment in which the
large majority of criminals live. He
advocated a minimum amount of
law enforcement and a maximum
effort to rehabilitate the criminal’s
environment in his comments about
examining the laws themselves for
their “content and effect of applica-
tion on people,” and his statements
concerning the rebuilding of this
“brutalizing” environment. It would
seem that Mr. Clark is more con
cerned about the affairs of the office
of the HEW than he is about the
functions of this former office; in
fact he even noted that under his
administration, only 2 percent of
all known crimes in America re
sulted in convictions. It was almost
as if he were attempting to convince
his audience of his
an Attorney-General

inefficiency as

One central question which must
be asked at this juncture is: Why
does Mr. Clark find it imperative to
adjust the methods of law enforce
ment to fit the needs of the people
in the ghetioes? If the people in
Harlem are for “Black Power,

By Robert LaRue

Despite a record setting perform-
ance by Washington and Lee’s “Mad
Stork,” Mike Neer, the Generals
fell to a clearly excellent Old Domi-
nion Squad, 90-79.

The 6'7” Neer set a school record
of 29 rebounds and added 32 points
to the W&L cause, while hitting on
67% of his floor shots.

~~ The Generals challenged the Mon-

archs throughout the first half,
largely on the basis of Neer’s shoot-
ing and rebounding artistry and the
playmaking of Ellie Gutshall. As the
end of the first half approached, Old
Dominion went on a hot streak
which turned a nine point Washing-
ton and Lee lead into a seven point
deficit. At the half, the Monarchs
led, 43-36.

Washington and Lee surged back
in the opening moments of the sec-
ond half, as neither team could build
up anything more than a three point
stake. Midway through the second
half the Monarchs rolled up suc-
cessive three point plays, taking the
lead to stay.

The Generals were woefully weak
at the foul line, in contrast to the
Monarchs, who missed only two in
fifteen attempts. Although Neer
went wild, Old Dominion did a fine
job of defending Mel Cartwright,
holding him to only eleven points
and eight rebounds, and a 31% floor
percentage.

Overall, Washington and Lee con-
trolled the boards by a 53-40 mar-
gin, as no Monarch broke into dou-
ble figure in rebounds. But Old
Dominion was not from the floor,
hitting 53% of the time compared
to the Generals 45%.

Rounding out the point produc-
tion for Washington and Lee were
Mike Daniel and Norwood Morri-
son, with 18 and 14 respectively.

Dave Twardzik, red-hot six foot-
er from Pennsylvania gunned in 24
points while hitting for 63% from
the floor. His partner in crime was
Jim Cole, who scored 20 points
with a 73% average. Skip Noble
added 17 points and Henry Lozon
tossed in 13 to aid the Monarchs.
Lozon was Old Dominion’s man on
the boards, pulling in nine, while
Noble, Cole and Steve Cox each
grabbed six.

The loss dropped Washington and
Lee to 13-5, while Old Dominion
raised its record to 17-2,

The Generals now journey to
Mars Hill and West Virginia Tech
for games Saturday and Tuesday.

Mars Hill is a North Carolina
school which Coach Canfield de-
scribed as “anxious to have at us.”

“We'll play to stop the run, settle

them down and make them play de-
fense,” commented the Washington
and Lee head coach.

Mars Hill, a run and shoot team
despite its size (the starting line-up
is 6’-0,’ 6-5”, 6-6", 6’-4”, 6”-10”).
It has defeated such notables as
Western Carolina. They feauture
one of the nations best all-around
small college players in Dave Wil-
mouth, 6’-5” strong man who is cur-
rently averaging 20 points and 12
rebounds a game.

West Virginia Tech has had a
rough schedule but nevertheless has
done well this year. The Engineers
have players nationally ranked in
shooting and rebounds, but are pri-
marily led by their little All-Ameri-
can Bob Floyd, who averages an
unbelievable 19 rebounds a game.

Tech also has a 6-5” freshman
who was All-Navy for four years
and another 6’-5” forward who is
averaging 20 points every game.

Coach Canfield commented that
both he and the team are extremely
grateful to the crowds which attend-
ed this week's three games. The
head coach also had a bite for the
officials, whom he felt “dampened
the crowd’s enthusiasm.” Several
times the officials warned the crowd
about the noise.

The round-ballers are still look-
ing forward to ending the season at
20-5, and to possession of the Col-
lege Athletic Conference champion-
ship. A big obstacle on the way to
St. Louis and a 20 win season is a
February 24 home encounter with
Virginia Commonwealth.

Mel Cartwright is still the high
point man with an even 18.0 points
per game for the 18 games. Mike
Neer is next with a 17.- average,
while Mike Daniel is third at 16.3.
Neer leads on the boards, averaging
16.6 a game. Cartwright follows at
11.1.

February 27 will find Washington
and Lee in St. Louis for the CAC
tournament attempting to improve
last year’s second place position.

Football Squad Begins Practice

Washington and Lee footballers
commenced their Spring drills Wed-
nesday following an organizational
meeting on Tuesday.

Head Coach Buck Leslie wel-
comed 47 players to the muddy
practice fields next to Wilson Field.
Two additional players are partici-
pating on the wrestling team.

“The spring workout gives us a
chance to look at a few faces, most-
ly on offense. We'll take a real good
look at the rising sopromores (Van
Amburgh and Fluharty) who will be
competing for quarterback. We'll
also be shoring up the tackle slot,”
said Coach Leslie. “We know what
we're looking for.”

The grid staff will also be look-
ing for a place-kicker to fill the void
left by the graduating Jack Baizley.

“George Harris has a very strong
leg, and John McNeil also has some
experience. This is a mechanical
thing,” Coach Leslie added.

Coach Leslie anticipates few
changes in either offense or defense.
“We'll take a look at flip-flopping
our split end and tight end more.”

Even less change is expected on
defense, where Coach Boyd Wil-
liams will concentrate on movement
and shifting. Coach Leslie pointed
out, “Teams kept automaticking

(changing signals at the line of
scrimmage according to the defen-
sive alignment) on us last year, more
so than before.”

Commenting on the first day in
pads, Coach Leslie said that there
was “good effort and good spirit, a
little huffin’ and puffin’.” The Gen-
erals will go over fundamentals by
means of drillwork for the next few
days. We won't do any more scrim-
maging than last year,” Coach Les-
lie noted,” “but it does give us the
chance to look.”

The Spring session will last

through February 26, with no prac-
tice on Saturday.

On the Liberation Front
Hello.

The Lee-Hi Truck Stop Libera-
tion Front, Local 367, is not really
concerned with trucks. It is a little
worried about our future: America
and all, you know?

I mean we don’t doubt for a min-
ute the U.S. Department of Defense
could whip up a couple of hundred
B-52’s and completely obliterate the
object of President Nixon’s fear of
being “the first American president

to lose a war.”

But then will there be anything
left except pollution? Yes. Dead
human beings. Have we come to the
point that the real possibility of the
suicidal death of our entire species
(much less of any one person) fails
to evoke a human response?

On Jan. 17, 1970, a new organi-
zation was formed within the Wash-
ington and Lee community. Its pur-
pose is:

of the national, social, and acade-

mic community and to explore
and undertake responsive action
on such problems as the misuse
of military power, the pollution
of our environment, the neglect
of minority rights, and the fail-
ures of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity to make a valuable con-
tribution to our times.”

The entire organization is ground-
ed in a commitment to the critical
examination of our community’s
ideals and inadequacies, and in a
commitment to take decisive action
toward resolving such existing prob-
lems, The influence of the organi-
zation will directly correspond to
the degree of honesty and responsi-
bility its members consistently make
in the effort to relate to the mem-
bers of the W&L Community, as
well as the community’s receptive
ability to such an examination,

The research committee is the
main focus of the organization’s
energy. The problems that the peo-
ple of the organization raise are
placed in context by the efforts of
the members of this permanent com-
mittee.

The program development com-
mittee designs and submits plans of
scheduled action and alternatives to
the organization to for decision,

The public relations committee
undertakes the responsibility for
correspondence and publicity.

Project “Stop” is the primary ef-
fort at present:

1) The Day of Focus will be held
in about one week.

a) A regular program of draft
counseling will begin.
b) A religious service given by

Lexington clergymen and open
to all is not definite but ef-
forts are in progress to make
this possible.

c) A- gathering and concert
with other college communities
will be held to unify action
against the war.

2) Work is in progress to make
the question of the war an un-
avoidable and significant issue in
the Virginia Senatorial race. The
candidates will be asked to come
to our campus.

This spring active support will be
given to the teach-in on environ-
mental problems of pollution and
special concern will be directed to
local pollution and conservation
problems,

A regularly scheduled symposium
(beginning next week) will examine
campus issues and will be open to
all.

Documenting films on different
subjects and from various sources
will be shown in the Student Center,
beginning in March.

A special project group on a
specific discrepancy in the curri-
culum is preparing a report for pre-
sentation in April.

That, in short, is why we decided
to call the organization the Lee-Hi
fruck Stop Liberation Front, Local
367. However, for the purpose of
correspondence with those of less
humor, we've decided to change the
official name to Dialogue. Tell us,
what could be a more harmless but
effective name?

McConnell Attacks Clark’s Talk

(Continued from Page 2)

does one do away with integrated
schools to adjust to their needs as
a community? If the answer to this
question is anything other than an
irrevocable “no,” then the next ques-
tion is this: who is it who has
enough sense to perceive society's
needs? Are we to enforce law differ-
ently in the ghettoes because of its
environmental diffrences?

These questions raise the issue of
the principle of every man’s equal-
ity before the law. The concept of
equality before the law arose when
the people demanded equality with
the nobility before the law. This
conception was implemented as a
fundamental cornerstone for the
original government of the United
States; and it is this cornersione
which is being chipped away by the
direction of Mr. Clark's argument.
He is in effect arguing that the im-
plementation and enforcement of
the law should depend upon the
social class of the offender. He ar-
rives at this implied conclusion by
the notion that law must be evalu-
ated by its “content and effect of
application on people” of different
classes.

The real danger in his argument
is this: if one argues that the applica-
tion of law enforcement is a class
matter (and he has done this when
he stated that those who break the
laws are environmentally deprived
for the most part), and that the ap-
plication of the law should be equal
in a democratic society, then one
comes to a screeching halt with the

conclusions: we must therefore es-
tablish an environmentally classless
society.

This is the direction towards
which Mr. Clark's argument pro-

ceeds. He stated in the question and
answer session that the education of
ghetto children was of prime im-
portance in combatting the “brutaliz-
ing” environment, that $1,000 more
per child would not be enough for

a marked improvement, and_ that

what was urgently needed was real
“integration.” Just what is that? Do
we have to have economic and en-
vironmental integration before law
can be enforced properly? What

The individual liberty upon which
this country was founded inherently
and necessarily breeds the inner
quality of one’s economic condition.
So, in this all-embracing zeal for en-
vironmental equality, to what extent
can one sacrifice the quality of in-
dividual liberty on the altar of pro-
per economic and social environ-
ment? Will we have a better quality
of justice and law enforcement if
we make this sacrifice? It would
seem that one who is supposed to be
a priest of justice and law enforce-
ment has become a prophet.

Mr. Clark’s fundamental misfor-
tune is that he refuses to recognize
that some injustice will always exist
in this world, and that law and its
enforcement cannot be fundament-
ally questioned or altered to fit the
needs of a particular social class. If
there are any anguished moans
from the reader at this conclusion,
let him ask himself if there is a
system of government in which
there is total justice and total wis-
dom among men. Can fallible men
become infallible? Does anybody
subscribe to that sort of optimism?
Are you out there, Dr. Pangloss?

Armband Response

To the Editor of the Friday Ring-
tum Phi,

Only on rare occasions do I be-
come sufficiently incensed at the
machinations of the © self-styled
guardians of the America liberal
tradition to take pen in hand to of-
fer a rebuttal; however, this is one
such occasion.

Upon venturing into the Student
Center on Monday, I observed a
rather interesting spectacle at the in-
formation booth. On the counter
were neatly laid a number of white
armbands and safety pins, suppos-
edly for attaching said armbands to
the arm.

Accustomed to such ostentatious
display and superficial commitment,
I paid little attention; however, there
was (and still is, I suppose) a sign
above the booth that summed up
more succinctly and more eloquent-
ly than any other means thus far
employed the misdirection (or small
I say misunderstanding) of the well-
intentioned aggregation of pacifists
operating the concession. The sign
read: “Wear the armband! Do your
share to end the war!”

Several implications may be
drawn from this rational, scientific
approach to the Vietnam problem.
Implicit first of all is the notion that,
should one choose not to wear an
armband, he is not doing his share
to end the war. Thus, implicitly, he
is not for “peace”. Implicit second
is the belief that, if one should
choose to wear an armband, he has
made the ultimate commitment, and
“done his thing” to end the war.

Either way, the wearer and the non-
wearer alike are subject to a “credi-
bility gap,” when the causal link be-
tween wearing an armband and end-
ing the war fails to emerge.

Although these idealists may sin-
cerely believe that such action will
end the war, in reality the goal will
be reached only by a commitment
more complete and more difficult.
To wear an armband is to indulge
the spirit with a transitory comfort.
But the “easy way out,” history tells
us, has very soldom been the best
way out. I think the point has been
made: as long as we continue to
apply simplistic and moral solutions
to a complex and political situation,
we will continue to become more
and more frustrated when our illu-
sory efforts yield nothing.

In closing, it might be appropriate
to apply the “armband rationale” to
a parallel situation, and hope that
some of our campus “band wearers”
will take it under consideration;
“Wear conventional dress—do your
share to improve and enhance the
appearance and reputation of
W&L.” Perhaps, in this case, the
rationale is acceptable. But it could
never happen...
