Tax Proposal Changed

By Walt Potter

According to Washington and Lee
University administration
the recently passed Senate version of
the Tax Reform Bill of 1969 will
sulisfy most of W&L’s objections to
the bill.

Washingion and Lee was among
the colleges, foundations and other
privately-supported institutions that

sources,

objected to the removal of many tax
deductions for charitable gifts by the
House of Representatives version of
the bill, passed August 2.

The bill still has several phases to
go through, including the compro
mise to be worked out in the joint-
Senate Committee. This compromise
will be crucial from the privately-
supported institutions’ viewpoint, as

the Committee will decide how much
of the House or the more liberal
Senate bill to use.

A major evidence of the WAL in-
volvement in the controversy over
the bill was President Huntley's
Selection to represent 26 inde-
pendent Virginia colleges in testify-
ing before the Senate Finance Com-
mittee on the bill September 18.

In testimony prepared for delivery
before the Senate Finance Commit-
tee, President Huntley called the re-
form bill a “meat-ax” approach and
termed it “the first significant step
backward with respect to the pro-
visions for charitable contributions
during the past 56 years of income
tax history.” The basic objection
seemed to be that “a real effect of
these changes (in tax law) and even
broader changes that will likely
follow would be to pull more power
away from the private sector and
place it in the public sector.”

Huntley did applaud the basic
aims of the Tax Act for closing tax
loopholes and even expressed his
group's willingness to accept com
promise On some aspects of deduc-
tions for charitable gifts, but he
firmly objects to such points as the
following

First, it would discourage charit
able gifts of appreciated property
and, in some instances, completely
eliminate tax incentives for making
gifts of appreciated property

Second, it would jeopardize
time-honored methods of charit
ible such as charitable re

W&L Contingent To Go
To DC for Peace

An as yet undertermined number
of Washington and Lee students will
participate in an anti-war march in
Washington, D.C., Nov. 15, accord-
ing to Walter Sales, president of the
campus Young Democrats.

The march protesting President
Nixon’s Vietnam policy will come at
the end of three days of anti-war
demonstrations at the nation’s capi-
tal, beginning Thursday, Nov, 13.
The demonstrations are part of the
November moratorium against the
war in Vietnam.

fhe New Mobilization Committee
is the group planning the march,
which will go up Pennsylvania Ave-
nue from the Capitol to the White
House and be followed by a rally on
the Mall.

However, Justice Department of-
ficials want to severely limit the
number of persons marching up
Pennsylvania Avenue because of fear
of violence. Yesterday's Washing-
ton Post reported that negotiations
between the government and protest
leaders for a permit for the march
had stalled.

Both government leaders and pro-
test Organizers are expecting at least
200,000 participants in the Saturday
march.

They will be housed by students
in colleges in the Washington area,
including George Washington, Ho-
ward, American, and Catholic uni-
versities,

On the two preceding days local
campus protests similar to those of
the October moratorium are being
planned across the country.

Although no formal plans for
moratorium activities at Washington

and Lee have been made yet, Sales

has been instrumental in getting
WAL student involvement in the
Washington march.

Although transportation from

Lexington to Washington will not be
provided on a formal basis, Sales
said several students will be driving

March

to Washington in private cars. He
added that anyone interested in mak-
ing the trip should contact him.
Students who need a ride to Wash
ington or who can provide one have
also been urged to contact Bruce
Ritz, Jeff Gingold, Dick Capron,
Kurt Krumperman, and Sean Reilly

1200 Guests Arrive
For Parents Program

More than 1200 guests are expect-
ed this weekend for the University’s
15th annual Parents Weekend.

Included in the pre-registration so
far are 1,020 parents of Washington
and Lee students and 213 other
guests, according to William C. Ty-
ler, assistant director of develop-
ment.

A three-day round of activities for
parents will begin Friday with tours
and appointments with faculty mem-
bers.

At 8 p.m, a student debate on the
subject of whether Washington and
Lee should become a coeducational
college will be held in Lee Chapel.
Dr. Louis W. Hodges, professor of
religion and chairman of the Univer-
sity’s coeducational committee, will
follow with a report on the progress
of the committee studying coeduca-
tion.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Ring-tum Phi A Look at Our Public Relations

Friday

Friday, November 7, 1969

An Adverse Effect

President Nixon’s speech Monday night sparked di-
vergent responses from the populace, but from all indications
reaction was based less on what he said than on previously
held ideas about the war which his speech did nothing to
change.

Whatever one’s position, it seems fairly clear that the
President was on the one hand reassuring his “silent ma-
jority” that he is ignoring the war protests in pursuit of a
policy upon which he has already decided. He wanted them
to confirm this assumed support, not elicit a reconsideration
from it.

On the other hand, it seems likewise clear that he was in
part addressing the protesters themselves by way of claim-
ing for his course of action a self-evident justification which
he feels all Americans must endorse. It is these minds we
assume he would like to change.

We cannot speak with any authority on how well his
silent majority accepted the part directed to them (they
are increasingly hard to find). We are, however, convinced
that his remarks, both in content and in presentation, have
no chance of mitigating the force of the protest planned next
week, or of those to come.

The “effete impudent snobs” (an appellation we suppose
the Nixon Administration has adopted as a convenient label
for those neither silent nor a majority) had some reason,
because of eagerness with which the news media anticipated
the speech, to expect a significant pronouncement. They were
disappointed, we are certain, to hear only the basic argument
reiterated.

The self-righteous assumptions from which the argu-
ment proceeded may be ultimately more damaging for the
President’s position. For many whom the President would
most like to reach, talk of America’s “destiny” in this con-
text has connotation which precludes reconciliation.

We will not here discuss the propriety of the present
policy in Vietnam. We can, however, conclude that Mr.
Nixon, if he has not adopted Johnson’s war as his own, is
at least assuming his predecessor's position far across the
generation gap, and that is no way to bring us together.

Burris Proposal Has Merit

It is seldom that a newly-elected class officer, especially
a freshman, has the acumen to realize his office is an ab-
surdity, or the courage to say so. Jeff Burris evidently has
both.

His proposal to require class presidents and vice-presi-
dents to attend Executive committee meetings (without a
vote) may not be the solution, simply because to institu-
tionalize the responsibility of assimilating ideas and advising
is not to insure that it will be assumed. It did, however, merit
more consideration than the EC gave it.

The need to make the two class officers something more
than merely the head of a dance weekend is obvious, but
as yet there is no formal way to utilize the talent that many
of these people obviously possess.

We do, then, agree with Mr. Burris in principle and ask
that he continue his efforts to find a suitable use for the
resources no one else has cared to tap, and that the EC

aid him in this undertaking.

Correcting A Mistake

The letter from Mr. Holland and the article on the Public
Relations Office, both on this page, serve to correct some
false impressions conveyed by last Friday’s editorial.

It seems Mr. Holland has already employed the re-
sources at his disposal to assist the Admissions Office in its
recruiting, and we stand corrected for advocating this action
ex post facto as a departure from the normal duties of the
Public Relations staff.

In the final analysis, however, this effort Mr. Holland's
office has undertaken, in addition to the normal functions of
his office and with virtually no increase in staff or facilities,
serves only to underline our major point.

That is, the Public Relations Office can be a vital adjunct
to the increasingly strenuous recruiting effort the University
is putting forth, But it can fullfill this service to the fullest,
and with the variety of materials and approaches necessary,
only if the facilities and staff are increased to a degree com-
mensurate with the task it faces.

President Huntley early in his term said that the Uni-
versity’s present concern, unlike that of the Gaines admini-
stration, is not of making W&L as good as its reputation;
rather, it is to make its reputation “as good as we really are.”
It is time the University allocated the funds to implement
that goal,

By Monty Cottier

Far more than just a receptacle
for weekly calendar notices, the Of-
fice of Public Relations has, under
Mr. Bob Holland, shown itself to
be a potentially vital and irreplace-
able part of W&L’s academic and
community life.

In the areas of both external and

internal communications, as he men-
tions, Mr. Holland has instituted
two major innovations designed to
better present and serve Washing-
ton and Lee. With the Education
Report, the school not only provides
a means of early identification of the
school by the high school students
in terms of who we are and what we
are doing, but also through the pub-
lication of prime examples of student
literary and journalistic work the
school is providing the students with
a strong incentive to use these re-
ports to become acquainted with
W&L.
' The first issue of the Educational
Report concerns the problem of
student unrest, and centers around
the activities of a W&L alumnus,
Rep. William Brock of Tennessee
who led a tour through 50 of the
nation’s campuses as a fact-finding
project. Also, the issue carries a
poem written by a high school stu-
dent in New York, thus making
good the promise of the notices sent
out to various schools, teachers and
counselors throughout the east and
south that student writings would be
published in the report.

By not trying to shower the stu-
dents with self-congratulatory pro-
paganda, but rather presenting them
with what Mr. Holland terms “art-
icles of interest to prospective col-
lege students,” the Office of Public
Relations gets the school’s name be-
fore the college prospects often, and
also induces them to take note.

The University Newsletter, also
mentioned by Mr. Holland in his
letter, has now come out in four
issues during this semester, By serv-
ing as a direct outlet for the Infor-
mation Service bulletins and re-

leases, these news items are guaran-
teed publication without the neces-
sity of printing flyers or posting no-
tices in the newspaper as a matter
of course, and reserves these avenues
for the exceptionally newsworthy
items,

Since, too, the newsletter will be
somewhat more faculty-oriented, and
certainly more directed toward the
sort of information generally disse-
minated by the Office of Public Re-
lations, the newsletter will provide
an excellent springboard for various
discussions and plan development.
Mr. Holland suggested specifically
the possibility of elaboration by de-
partments of plans for the six-week
term, but made it clear that this was
only one example of the sort of use

to which this newsletter could be
put,

In addition to these two innova-
tions, the Office of Public Relations
continues, as it has in the past, to
send tapes, news releases, photo-
graphs, and so on to a variety of
newspapers, radio and television sta-
tions, and other media in the area
and throughout the country, from
special-interest historical journals to
national publications. These are used
to explain W&L’s basic objectives
and ideals in terms of what Mr. Hol-
land terms “the faculty expertise on
the various issues.”

Thus, the Office of Public Rela-
tions can be seen as an invaluable
part of the administrative structure
at Washington and Lee, functioning

not merely as a grist mill for endless
throwaway flyers and notices and
self-congratulatory handouts to high
school students, but instead as a re-
liable department dedicated to the
spread of genuine public relations,
or, to use Mr. Holland’s words
again, “Public relations means put-
ting our best foot forward, But it
also means answering and reporting
as candidly as possible questions
about the problems of the contem-
porary university.” He adds, “A
crying need exists for honest and
Open communication of the goals,
requirements, and accomplishments
of the higher education enterprise.”
With his new programs, this is cer-
tainly what the Public Relations Of-
fice is moving towards,

Letters to the Editor...

Public Relations

To the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:
| appreciate the thoughtful and
constructive editorial of Friday, Oc-
tober 31, regarding the need for an
expanded public relations effort by
Washington and Lee, particularly
with respect to students who might
be attracted here. The writer's in-
terest in the long-range welfare of
the University is to be commended,
and his ideas are soundly-based.

It should be noted, however, that
we have already begun to move in
the direction he suggests. The edi-
torial observation that the Office of
Public Relations has never had duties
beyond sending news releases to
Virginia newspapers and to home-
town papers of our students is in-
accurate. In the first place, our re-
leases go also to radio and television
stations, and in the case of major
stories, to the nation’s leading edu-
cation writers, to special-interest
educational, historical and journalis-
tic publications, to general-purpose
publications, and to media in and
out of Virginia, But more pertinent

Military Role at W&L
Re-examined by Olson

(Editor's Note: This is the first
of two articles examining the value
of ROTC on the W&L campus. In
our November 14 issue, the case for
ROTC at Washington and Lee will
be presented by Doug Hamilton.)

By David Olson

For eighteen years the Reserve Of-
ficer’s Training Corps of the United
States Army has had a very pleasant
existence on this campus. For next
year, with a new curriculum, the
University is reviewing its policy to-
wards ROTC. It does not appear
that this policy is not going to
change. I hope to examine some of
the issues in question.

The first question is that of aca-
demic credit. That is: should ROTC
courses receive academic credit? Of
course in the past the classroom sec-
tion of ROTC has received acade-
mic credit. A University official has
said that under the new curriculum
this policy will probably not change.
My only quarrel with this is that
juniors and seniors are able to take
only four academic courses and
ROTC and still have the required
number of hours per semester (14).
What this means is that some stu-
dents are substituting ROTC for an
academic course. I think that stu-
dents should be required to take a
full academic load and ROTC
should be over and above the re-
quired number of hours. It is unfair
to those students not taking ROTC
that those students who are can take
a reduced academic load, ROTC
should not be an exemption from
academic work.

Another bone of contention is the
status of ROTC faculty. The Uni-
versity is required to give the top
man in the ROTC department a full
professorship and the rest of the
members of the department get com-
mensurate positions, This is required
by the Federal government although
the University is allowed to review
each candidate, and the ROTC fac-
ulty is certainly not subjected to the
same academic rigors that are re-
quired of the civilian faculty mem-
bers. This is another point concern-
ing the question of academic credit,
for the faculty in ROTC has cer-
tainly not been through the same
training as the civilian faculty and
somewhere the academic quality of
the work in ROTC must suffer. An
other point is that not a single mem
ber of the ROTC faculty holds a

graduate degree. The most alarm-
ing point of this question though is
the fact that ROTC faculty mem-
bers are allowed to vote in faculty
meetings. Many of the votes in fac-
ulty meetings are quite close and an
ROTC vote could make a differ-
ence. What is in question is the
loyalty of these faculty members.
They have the shortest time on this
campus and their interest in Uni-
versity policy is questionable. They
are paid by the government, not the
University, and it seems inequitable
that they should vote as regular
members of the faculty.

The final, and, in my opinion,
most important issue is the moral
one, and this is vitally connected
with the war in Vietnam. It seems to
me that the purposes of ROTC are
antithetical to those of the Univer-
sity as an academic institution, The
military discipline is one of regimen-
tation, where there is a prescribed
way of handling any number of
situations, The University teaches
open-mindedness; it teaches the stu-
dent how to handle life as an in-
dividual. ROTC teaches the student
to be part of a giant military ma-
chine which in the light of the Viet-
nam war is concerned mainly with
killing. ROTC students are taught
how to kill with rifles and Ranger
students are taught how to kill with
their bare hands, They are taught
how to be cogs in a great murder
machine. In effect the University is
feeding a war machine, a machine
that conducts a war to which many
of today's students violently object.

I certainly feel that college men
should have the opportunity to get
officer training if they want it, My
objection is that I feel that the camp-
us is not the place to do it. A special
committee of ROTC that reported
to the Secretary of Defense offered
either off-campus centers or extend-
ed summer programs as viable alier-
natives to ROTC on campus. | saw
no real reason in the report why this
could not be done. There are far
loo many iniquities in the present
system for it to continue. The best
thing to do would be to make ROTC
totally devoid of any campus con-
nections, In this way the iniquities
of the system could be relieved and
the military could still have their
officer openings filled by the altern-
utives mentioned above, It is my
opinion that ROTC does not belong
on the campus and 1 feel that the
inconsistencies stated above are
more than enough reason for its re
moval, or at least a change in pre

sem university policy.

to the point the writer raises—the
need to reach the high schools—is a
new service the office has begun this
fall.

An Education and Information
Service to high schools has been in-
itiated by my office within the last
two months, The service, which takes
the form of a paper entitled “Wash-
ington and Lee University Educa-
tion Report,” is geared to the junior
or senior in high school, The first
issue dealt with some of the causes
of student unrest as seen by a group
of touring Congressmen led by Rep.
William E, Brock, a W&L alumnus.
Future issues will carry articles of
interest to prospective college stu-
dents on topics such as student fi-
nancial aid, how to prepare oneself
for college, college admissions pro-
grams, and facets of student life.
The service will also reprint ex-
amples of outstanding high school
journalism and creativity, as found
in school literary magazines and
newspapers, for distribution to par-
ticipating schools,

The first edition of “Education
Report” was mailed during October
to approximately 2,000 high schools,
along with a survey form to ascer-
tain interest of the high schools. The
return response has been enthusias-
tic beyond fondest expectation.
Many schools are indicating that
they will use this service of Wash-
ington and Lee in student publica-
tions or as guidance material. I fee!
public relations is most effective
when it includes a public service
aspect, rather than consisting just of
blatant propaganda. I hope, and ex-
pect, that interest will be stimulated
in Washington and Lee because it
offers a useful service, not because

it’ indulges in self-congratulatory
back-patting.
Basically, high schools from

Maryland and West Virginia south
to Florida and west to Texas were
included in the first mailing because
we were using the only well-develop-
ed list currently available—that of
the Southern Interscholastic Press
Association, which was run by WAL
for 40 years, I have included select-
ed other schools in New York, Cali-
fornia, Ohio and Illinois whose pub-
lications programs I am personally
acquainted with, but we could cer-
tainly use suggestions from our stu-
dents for additional schools outside
the “Establishment South” to in-
clude, Dean Farrar has given me
much help by furnishing the ad-
dresses of selected inner-city high
schools in which the Admissions Of.
fice is concentrating effort to recruit
disadvantaged students. The ma-
terials will reach guidance per-
sonnel, as well as students, in those
schools.

Parenthetically, 1 might mention
that the Office of Public Relations
also has the task of promoting inter-
nal communication, and toward that
end we have initiated a faculty news.
letter this fall, We also continue to

publish the weekly University Calen-
dar.

It is understandably difficult for
many in the W&L community to
understand how the national news
media could often omit such an im-
portant institution as Washington
and Lee from many of the educa-
tional roundups. It is much easier to
understand when you have been an
education writer for a daily news-
paper and have been the target of a
barrage of releases from hundreds of
colleges and other educational in-
stitutions across the country. When
a paper fails to mention us, it
doesn't mean we haven't been trying.

I recognize that the communica-
tions service we have started with
ve high schools is but a small step,
and | welcome suggestions for fur-
ther steps. The concern by the lead-
ership of both editions of the Ring-
tum Phi, and by other stuednts here,
for constructive changes at W&L
and in W&L’s relations with the
public is commendable.

Sincerely,
Robert G. Holland
Public Relations Director

A Reply to Newman
lo the Editor, the Friday

Ring-tum Phi,

I would like to reply to the un-
informed reply of Everett Newman
in the November fourth issue of
the Ring-tum Phi. I believe that Mr.
Newman should have first investi-
gated—a good scholastic idea—be-
fore using his trite cliches on the
“alumnus and father.” The “alumnus
and father” was my own father.
He requested to have his name with-
held as a means of “protection” for
myself—protection I did not ask
for, but that a considerate father
felt was a respectful gesture.

I do not necessarily agree with
all of my father's opinions, but |
do respect him for the life of total
involvement in civic affairs that he
has led. Of course Mr. Newman did
not care to investigate into the true
spirit of the letter, but only cared to
write cheap phrases about a man
he knows nothing about.

My father only asked students to
try to “sell their fellow students on
the value of these customs.” He did
not ask for a return to the “old”
system; all he asked was that stu-
dents attempt to rediscover the
value of these customs, Customs that
are often not thought over, but
rather discarded without thinking by
students who consider it the “in
thing to do,” deserve a more in-
tellectual approach.

My father did not just go to
school “to wear suits and say “hi!”
He came for an education also, An
education that may have taught him
one basic thing—before acting one
should thoroughly investigate the
situation,

NCAA Soccer Bid

The Washington and Lee soccer
team took a big step towards a
NCAA bid last Wednesday when it
edged a strong VPI team 2-1. Play-

er at Blacksburg, the Generals never
trailed in the game. Chip Tompkins

ter when his shot caromed off the

cross bar into the VPI goal. This
single tally stood up throughout the
first half.

VPI tied the score in the third
quarter, but Carl Hyatt put the
Generals in front for good later
when his screen shot easily beat the
helpless VPI goalie. Hyatt now has
five goals, a remarkable achievement
for a halfback.

This was a must game for the
Generals, for they cannot afford an-
other loss in division play. Roanoke
has already completed its competi-
tion in the Western Division of the
V.LS.A., its record standing at 5-1-1,

NCAA bid would disappear.

Team Out to Break
Wilson Field Jinx

“Personnel-wise, they are as sound as any of the bet-
ter teams we have played this year’, voiced Washington and
Lee’s Buck Leslie in describing Southwestern’s Tigers, this
Saturdays grid opponent. Indeed, the Memphis-based club
will return with most of the key personnel from last year’s
squad which drubbed the Generals, 38-7.

“They throw and run well, and
LeBlanc leads a tough defense”, add-

;d the Head General. Despite a 3-4
record that includes conference vic-
tories over Sewanee and Washing
ton University, and a loss to C.A.C.
leader Centre, the Tigers are solid
all the way around. Piloted by
Freshman Quarterback Bob Carter,
Southwestern displays a rollout pass-
ing game to go with the running of
Fullback Dave Allen, and Tailbacks
Jim Bryan and Gene Sides. The aer-
ial show features 6'7” Tight End
David Mullins. On defense, the
Tigers rely on a 5-3-3 monster with
periodic inside blitzes.

The Generals will be trying to
break the home field jinx which sud
denly appears to have struck them.
Washington and Lee has yet to win
a home game in three tries, losing
to Randolph-Macon, Centre, and
Tufts. All three of the victories have
come on enemy turf, as Towson
State, (14-3), Hampden-Sydney, (21
13), and Bridgewater, (10-6), have
all fallen on their own territories.
The Generals’ fourth loss, the 37

21 holocaust at Sewanee last week,
has been the only loss sustained on
the road thus far.

This will be the last home ap-
pearance of the year for the 1969
version of the Washington and Lee
football team. Ten seniors will be
taking part in their last pre-game
drills on Wilson Field this Saturday.
They are: Quarterbacks Chuck
Kuhn and Jack Baizley, Defensive
Back Johnny Nolan, Center and Tri-
Captain Thunder Thornton, Tackle
and Tri-Captain Tom McJunkin,
Ends Steve Mahaffey and John Tho-
mas, Linebackers Dean Kumpuris
(the third Tri-Captain) and Jay Meri-
wether, and Tackle George Hamlin

As an added attraction, this week-
end is Washington and Lee’s fif-
teenth annual Parents’ Weekend, an
incentive which will hopefully boost
the Generals “for more”. “We are
expecting a lot of emotion”,
Coach Leslie earlier in the week.

Injury-wise, the Generals are in
fair shape. Doug Gossmann, Junior

W&L swimmers have been
practicing hard for the last few
weeks in anticipation of another
winning season. The Generals finish-
ed last year with a 7-2 record and a
second at the CAC championship,
but this year Coach Stearns faces a
tougher schedule and the hole left
by graduated All-American Billy
Ball. Added to the schedule this
year are Dickinson College and
Catholic University (scheduled, but
called off last year due to the flu)
Coach Stearns is presently scanning
the freshmen and returning letter
men for someone to fill Ball's place
in the backstroke and medley events.

He also needs a breaststroker, which
was the Generals’ poorest event last
year

Coach Stearns commented that
the spirit of the team was the best
he has seen. The swimmers for the
last three weeks have been swim-
ming a mile (76 lengths) in the
morning and often swim up to a
mile in the afternoon practice. They
have just completed a series of per
formance tests in 100 and 200 yard
lengths of all the major strokes

Action Continues at Theatre;
“King Lear” Rehearsals Start

By Lawrence MeConnell

With the close of The Homecom-
ing last week at the Troubadour
Theater, it would seem that action
has died down at the small, red brick
garage. Not true. The cast for King
Lear has been chosen, the script has
been cut, and the set is almost ready.

Professor George Ray of the Eng-
lish department has been working
on cuts in the Shakespearian script
for two weeks. Upon Mr. Kahn's
request, he researched the actual
text as it appeared in the First Quar-
to and the First Folio. With addi-
tions and deletions in each version,
Ray tried to pick out the essential
textual crux of the play.

“The problem, frankly, is to cut
Lear down to size for modern audi
ences, The uncut play runs for about
4 hours, a little too long to hold
anyone’s interest, | think.” Ray also
mentioned that he didn't chop out
more than 17 lines in any one place,
assuring a carefully preserved script
for performance,

Ken Barnes is the set designer for
Lear. With the help of the set crew
he has been able to construct and
mount the major parts of the set al-
ready. He calls his design “a Sione-
henge effect.” Functionally, it will
“serve to isolate the action in one
section of the stage or another in
order to make scene changes easier.
The functional design is what they
call a ‘unit set’ and it’s really the
only way we can put Lear on in this
small theatre.”

King Lear will have two directors,
Lee Kahn as the head director and
a graduated senior, Kirk Wood
ward, as assistant director, Kahn in

freestyle, breaststroke, butterfly,
and backstroke.

Needless to say, the main strength
of the team will be in co-captains
Roger Martin and Scott McElroy
along with All American Bill Brum-
back and veterans John Lawlor,
David Kympton, and Bim Clark.
Freshman Alan Corwith, however,
is challenging Brumback’s position
as number one freestyler. Brumback
was only able to edge Corwith out
by .5 seconds in the 100 yard free-
style. Corwith and Brumback should
form a deadly combination in the
freestyle events.

Other promising freshmen include
fom Murray who may be the need-
ed backstroker the team needs and
Alan Sharp who has led the team in
reeent tests in the breaststroke
events. Both veterans Bim Clark
and Bert Meem have been perform-
ing exceptionally well. Clark has
done well in both the butterfly and
backstroke events and Meen is close
behind.

Returning veterans John Blalock,
Hal Catlin, Jeff Grossman, and Rick
Sands will give added depth to the

Besides the two new additions to

the four weeks of rehearsal, “be-

the style—Shakespearian language
is sort of tough for any modern ac-
tor to handle.” The size of the cast

male parts and three female parts in
the Troub production, The costumes
lor the play will be from the Lin-
coln Center collection, the same
ones used in the Center’s production
of the play. .
