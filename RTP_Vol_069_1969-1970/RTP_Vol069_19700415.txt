‘Earth Da y’
Program Plans
Are Announced

the Earth Day Sym-
posium on April 22 have been fin-
alized, according to Ronny Sklar
and Steve Maslansky, symposium di-
rectors. The day long activities,
sponsored by the University Federa-
tion of Concern, are designed to
educate the university community
into all aspects of environmental
planning and control.

The program will concern itself
primarily with three areas, the pres-
ent state of the ecology system and
its future if no immediate action is
taken; the action being taken today
by responsible industry and the
general state of the arts in pollution
control; and what we must do to in-
sure the quality of our life in this
finate eco-system.

All sessions will be held in Lee
Chapel.

At 2 p.m. Professor Thomas Nye
will speak on “The General Nature
of the Eco-System.”

Following Nye will be Dr, Robert
F. Testine, chief of Reynolds Metal's
environmental planning who recent-
ly testified before Jennings Ran-
dolph’s (D-W.Va.) Senate Committee
on pollution. Dr, Testine will speak
on the subject of solid waste, and
will be aided by a representative
from the West Virginia Pulp and
Paper Company discussing water
pollution, and a representative from
the Ethyl Corporation speaking on
air pollution.

Bernard Cohen, one of the most
renowned lawyers active in the field
of resources and pollution law, will
deliver an address on “The Law
and Pollution.” His talk will deal
with the prosecution of offenders
under common law and the present
statutes and new laws needed to pur-
sue an ecologically balanced envir-
onment.

Beginning at 8 p.m., there will be
an address by Garrett DeBell, Wash-
ington lobbyist for the Zero Popula-
tion Growth Committee and editor
of the recent book The Environ-
mental Handbook. He will speak on
“Population Stablization.”

Following DeBell’s address will be

Richie Havens will appear in concert Saturday night as part of this
year’s schedule for Springs Weekend. A Friday night concert will fea-

‘Dreams’

To Be Featured

In Friday Night Concert

A highly-touted new jazz-rock
ensemble called “Dreams” has been
contracted to perform at Friday
night's Springs Concert. This group,
which has received rave reviews at
Colgate, Bucknell and Vanderbilt,
will complement Saturday night's en
tertainment featuring Richie Havens

Dreams is an exciting and unusual
new group which has played to
standing ovations at the Fillmore
East and The Electric Circus as well
as its college engagements. Provid
ing a hint as to where Rock is head
ed, Dreams fuses the inspirations
and influences of six outstanding
musicians into a true group experi-
ence which projects a fire and spon-
taneity never heard before in a horn
band

Joe Klee of Rock magazine caught
them in concert at the Fillmore
where they brought down the house
He considers them better than
BS&T,. “Well, for one thing, the
band is not over-arranged (one of
BS&T’s problems). It doesn’t sound
like a bunch of session men reading
parts. Kent, Rogers, and the Breck-
ers are solo voices whose improvisa-
tions are not jazz or rock, but in-
dividual musical personalities play-
ing their thing. Another difference is
the songs written by Lubhan and
Kent. Whereas BST relies on pre-
viously written material for the most

part, Dreams does all originals.”

But perhaps the most ecstatic re-
action was that of Colgate’s Student

Activities Director James MecClin
tock when he wrote Dreams’ man
iger that “the group provided the

most sensational ‘opening act’ with

trouble, as a result, was that

The deadline for petitions was not
extended and consequently the posi-
tion will not appear on the ballots.
No arrangements have been made
with regard to filling the position.

Candidates will speak in Evans
Dining Hall on Thursday at 7:00
p.m. The primary election will be
held on Monday April 20. If neces-
sary, run-off elections will be held
on Thursday, April 23.

A petition was presented to the
EC calling for the placement of a
constitutional amendment on the bal-
lot. The amendment calls for sub-
stituting a one year’s suspension
from the University in lieu of ex-
pulsion wherever convictions arise
from honor trials.

Dean Kumpuris and Staman Ogil-
vie observed that the petition was
not presented in the form of an
amendment and could not be voted
on, as such. Markham remarked
that the intent of the petition was
clear and he felt that it was the EC’s
duty to draft the petition into a con-
stitutional amendment. This was
agreed upon and the amendment
will appear on the ballots,

Dave Bethea reported that the
faculty passed the Curriculum Com-
mittee’s proposal for an independent
exam program. He stated that Dean
Watt was soliciting suggestions from
the EC regarding details of the pro-
gram. A committee was appointed
to study a procedure for the pro-
gram which will go into effect next
fall.

Dean Kumpuris proposed that the
Dance Board President's salary be
reinstated. He stated that the ori-
ginal justification for the salary was
that it was a fair compensation for
the job.

The Executive Committee also
passed a motion urging candidates to
refrain from placing election posters
on trees.

EC-proposed amendments to the
constitution will also be balloted on
Monday and include the following:

1) one revising voting procedures
and adapting them to the new calen-
dar;

2) one renaming the Assimilation
Committee to the University Cen-
ter—Orieniation Committee and en-
trusting it with the functions its new
name implies:

3) one removing the EC's appel-
late powers over decisions of the

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Wednesday, April 8, 1970

A Commendable Action

The difficulty the Executive Committee had with the
petition to amend the constitution concerning the Honor
System was that the petitioners had not themselves supplied
the proper wording. Further, there was some debate on
whether the matter was in fact constitutional or merely pro-
cedural. The move was then to throw out the petition on tech-
nicalities. Fortunately, the motion was defeated and the issue
will be submitted to the students in next week’s election.

The amendment would, if passed, constitutionally limit
the EC to a one-year suspension penalty for conviction of an
honor violation. We don’t favor such a move, since this seems
the least viable of many possible alternatives to the present
penalty, and we hope those who agree with us will their
ballot accordingly next week.

In any case, however, EC action on the matter was com-
mendable. The decision that it could in fact be a constitu-
tional amendment was made because only in the constitution
can students limit the EC or invest it with power. Thus mere-
ly a procedural modification would be subject to the magna-
nimity of subsequent Executive Committees and would not
provide a student referendum which is one of the main pur-
poses of the present petition.

Although in general we think the EC should avoid inter-
preting intent, its decision to provide the petition with the
proper wordng is in this instance acceptable. In the first place,
the intent was clear, and the petitioners were acting on cred-
ible, though as it turned out, erroneous information. More
important, any delay in submitting the issue to the students
would have served further to obfuscate an already too emo-
tion-tinged debate. We assume rejection of the petition would
have postponed a vote until next year, when a minimal turn-
out, as would probably be the case in the fall elections, might
only distort the picture.

The value of the petition is that it will submit to the stu-
dents, upon whom the Honor System relies, the question of
the acceptability of the present penalty as opposed to an often
suggested alternative. It is unfortunate that the constitution
makes no provision for referendums, so the amendment is
the only way to pose the issue. The difficulty with the alter-
native of a one-year suspension is that it will likely lead to a
ranking of honor violations according to severity and will
finally render to the Honor System meaningless. What is
vitally needed is a thorough examination of the consistency
of the philosophies of Washington and Lee as an educational
institution and of the Honor System, with whatever adjust-
ments are necessary. Only in that way will the matter be re-
solved, and this petition formally opens the question to de-
bate for the first time in three years.

On the Matter of $250

Considering the general attitude toward the Dance Board
the past few years, many students may resent Dean Kum-
puris’ motion to the EC to reinstate the Dance Board presi-
dent’s yearly $250 salary.

The argument to retain the salary in the past has been
that while the elected student officials are accorded the pres-
tige of their offices, only the salary is offered as compensation
to the Dance Board president. Of course, since the Dance
Board vice-president, who always succeeds to the presidency,
will be elected in the future, such an argument seems to fail.

The position, however, is supportable on other grounds.
The first is a matter of philosophy. The EC has properly
realized this year that its powers in certain areas such as the
Publications Board are over-extended and ought to be re-
stricted. The most significant difference between the Dance
Board and the Publications Board is that the former does not
depend on a student tax for any part of its income and hence
student government intervention into its affairs is less justified
in principle.

Second, of course, is a matter of practicality. Since the
Dance Board is freely subscribed to, students may, if they
feel their money is being channeled into extraneous areas,
stop subscribing.

The question ts not, then, whether the Dance Board presi-
dent should receive a salary but whether anybody but the
Dance Board itself, and its subscribers through the choice
they are offered, should govern its affairs. We think not.

Take the Time

The elections Monday, in addition to narrowing the field
to two candidates for student body president and Dance
Board and IFC vice-presidents will include a constitutional
amendment the EC has proposed to allow elections to take
place in accordance with the new calendar on which W&L
will be operating next year

That amendment, along with the renaming and re-assign
ing the Assimilation Committee (to the University Center
Committee) and the one removing the EC’s power of review
over the Publications Board, is consonant with current feeling
on the matters involved and deserves the support of the entire
student body. The alternative, in the first case, is probably
chaos for next year's elections. For the others, passage means
the facilitating of operations for major aspects of student life
Considering the stakes involved, the price of the time to cast

1 ballot is small R. LI

Presidential Hopefuls Outline Plans

 

Richard Kampf. . .

Hoping not to be too brief in the

small space alloted to me here, |
shall summarize some of the most
important parts of my platform,

Curriculum: Firstly, | support an
independent exam schedule in which
the student is allowed to choose the
date and time at which he will take
and submit his examinations. The
plan recently submitted to the Exe-
cutive Committee is too vague and
a more definite plan in which the
student is given the responsibility to
plan his own exams is needed.

Secondly, a revocation is needed
of the new ruling concerning cuts,
so that the student not the teacher
should be the one who must make
the choices which will determine his
education. Rulings such as this gear-
ed with the immature student in
mind have been typical of the fac
ulty, and it is about time we started
making rules to suit the mature, re
sponsible student, or they just are
not going to come here.

I would also like to put an end
to such relatively worthless fresh-
man courses as three hundred years
of European History in one sem-
ester, and instead institute new
courses dealing with current prob-
lems which surely would be more
worthwhile.

Ae regards the honor system, I
am in favor of a revocation of the
absolute penalty, and the substitut-
ing of a penalty of expulsion for a
year in its place. This, of course,
requires an amendment to the EC
constitution which although difficult,
surely can be achieved.

Modification of the admissions
policy in which the admissions com-
mittee seems to be to sit back and
wait for the applications to pour in
and then wonders why it cannot
seem to recruit underprivileged or
minority group students (or for that
matter even top notch students of
any kind) is needed.

Recruiting of capable underprivi-
leged students could be in part done
by a group of students themselves
in the areas in which they live. If
we do not seek these students they
are not going to apply here. A stu-

s/Richard Kampf

Fran Lawrence...

A university community this size
can offer a unique opportunity for
a continuous exchange among its
most diverse members. It can allow
the individual a special sort of free-
dom, moving laterally in its various
social and educational groups, with-
out estrangement from a particular
group. This seems to me to be at the
root of the liberal college experi-
ence. This sort of university com-
munity has been realized at W&L
only in part.

Our size, our location, and our
basic educational philosophy pro-
mote this. But the mutually exclu-
sive terms of “The Hill,” “the
House,” “the Road,” and “the Coun-
try” indicate a kind of illmess that
prevents its meaningful application.
We are in many ways a splintered
commuter school.

Big schools, like cities, must neces-
sarily rely on caricature and labels
of its various social and educational
cliques to mobilize student affairs.
Caricatures and labels are absurd
at Washington and Lee, we must
realize the inaccuracy of their dis-
tortions. Instead of acting against
“psuedo-subversive” groups, we
should direct our energies toward
the solution of solvable problems

The center of our educational
lives should be the university and
education should be in a real way
our life here. The Student Center
has helped to bring new life to “the
Hill” for many. Its programs must
be expanded through this center,
guest lectures, and expanded student
productions. We must give Washing-
ton and Lee a sense of “the world.”
Ironically, the faculty is in the van-
guard of those widening the poten-
tial for a freer more creative col-

lege experience. We must both real-
ize the potential and indicate our
own need for complete student in-
volvement in the university com-
munity.

Fraternities must move on their
own to involve themselves in new di-
mensions, encouraging the college to
meet them in other kinds of inter-
course than that usually advocated.
The dying and the dead houses
should admit a “fait acompli” and
close down, freeing their members
to revitalize the college and them-
selves. It is time a more realistic
number of students were in fraterni-
ties.

Coeducation is essential. “Under-
standing” is a critical word in con-
temporary life and we cannot under-
stand each other through telepathy
from forty miles away. In a real
sense, women are an emerging soc-
ial group like the blacks and “separ-
ate but equal” a dated concept. I
suggest that planning to schedule

Joe Tompkins ...

As a candidate for a student gov-
ernment office in the past, I have
always attempted to let students
know my ideas and my viewpoint.
Even though unopposed in last year’s
election, I made it a point to inform
you where I stood. The goals |
have set for myself for next year, if
elected President, are numerous, so
that the points listed below are brief
summarizations at best.

STUDENT REPRESENTATION

-During the past year, | have come
to realize that there is a growing
number of students who feel that
their views and opinions are neither
represented nor appreciated by the
Excutive Committee. Due in part to
a lack of communication between
Executive Committee members and
the students, but also resulting from
some inherent characteristics of the
present student government system,
this feeling of alienation leads to a
lessening of the legitimacy of the
Executive Committee and to a feel-
ing of apathy and indifference. It
is sadly ironical that this is the situa-

tion at a small university such as
ours, where there should be a feel-
ing of community and the oppor-
tunity for participation in student
affairs. There is no instant solution
to the problem, but if elected, I
will be willing to do what is neces-
sary to insure that each student feels
that his viewpoint is being represent-
ed, whether it be the creation of an
additional governing body or a re-
structuring of the existing one.
HONOR SYSTEM—The absolute
penalty always becomes the focal
point of criticism of the Honor
System. However, I am not so sure
that it is the root of the problem of
declining support for the system.
To support an honor system, the stu-
dents it affects must have a clear
awareness of its procedures and a
strong belief in its fairness. To ac-
complish this, I will initiate a series
of discussions and newspaper ar-
ticles, in order to make students feel
closer to the Honor System and to
inform them of the alternatives to
our present system. Such a program
will allow the Honor System to be
viewed in its proper perspective and
then judged on its merits.
IMPROVED COMMUNICA-
TION — This includes informal
meetings of the President and/or
E. C. members with groups of stu-
dents, periodic visitation of frater-
nity houses by the President, better
distribution of E. C. minutes, an-
nouncement of the E. C. agenda
previous to each meeting, informing
students of conferences and sym-
posiums at other schools, and the
forming of ad hoe study groups dur-
ing the year to deal with specific
issues and involve more students.

IMPLIMENTATION OF RE-
CENTLY ESTABLISHED PRO-
GRAMS — Many new programs,

offering great opportunities for stu
dent participation, were established
this year. Having participated in the
discussion of these programs and
initiated some of them myself, I
will make sure that they are carried
out, both in letter and in spirit.
These programs include the Student
Planning and Developing Commit-
tee, the Underprivileged Applicant
Committee, the Admissions and Re-
cruitment Committee, and the Con-
ference Fund Committee.

ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVE-
MENT — The Executive Commit-
tee is sorely in need of a better sys-
tem of keeping records and compil-
ing E. C. resolutions and recom-
mendations. The yearly appoint-
ments made by the President and
the E. C. have grown to such prop-
ortions and the number of resolu
tions is such that an improved sys-
tem of record maintenance is
needed.

These are only some of the im-
portant issues to be dealt with next
year. The new curriculum, the de-
ferred rush system, and the exchange
program will offer both opportun:
ties and challenges. Indeed, next
year will be a crucial year for all

By Betty Munger
Manager, W&L Bookstore

In the April 4th issue of the
New Yorker there is a cartoon of
a doctor arriving to visit an obvious-
ly very ill man. The man’s wife ex-
plains his illness by saying “This is
the man who ate the steak that
came from the steer that nibbled the
grass that grew in the field where
roamed the cat that caught the bird
that ate the fish that fed on the bug
that floated around in the oil slick.”

There it is: the interrelationship of
all the problems of pollution in
water, earth and sky. Most of the
books which are being published so
fast these days deal with specific
areas of our environment and _ its
ills. Silent Spring by Rachel Carson
is the classic one, focusing on the
ecological effects of insecticides.
Others of the same kind are Perils
of the Peaceful Atom, Redoing
America, Destruction of California,
Water, The Unclean Sky and S/S/S
and the Sonic Boom (noise pollu-
tion). Just a month ago a follow-up
on Miss Carson's book appeared,
called Since Silent Spring by Frank
Graham, it tells of the immediate
reaction to the original book and
documents what has happened —
none of it good — since Miss Car-
son sounded the alarm seven years
ago.

There increasing

are emphases

Interlocking Pollution

on broader perspectives in such
books Science and Survival by Com-
moner, The Human Use of Human
Beings by Norbert Weiner (could
we be heading for a computer pol-
lution???) and Utopia or Oblivion
by Buckminster Fuller.

What to do? Can we reverse our
directions and our dependency on
affluent waste? The Earth Day
Teach-Ins in 3,000 high schools and
1,000 colleges testifies to the con-
cern of the young people. De Bell
has published a book for use by ac-
tivists for this day and into the fu-
ture called the Environmental Hand-
book. One way that has tremendous
appeal is just to get away—head for
the woods — (a cop-out?)! The sales
of such books as How to Stay Alive
in the Woods by Angier and Stalk-
ing the Wild Asparagus by Gibson
speaks for this enthusiasm.

One important method of arous-
ing interest and action is to show
what beauty there is in our world.
Rachel Carson’s A Sense of Won-
der carries this awareness of the
value of our vanishing natural
world. Best of all, though, in my
opinion is In Wildness is the Pre-
servation of Mankind with its ach-
ingly beautiful photographs by Eliot
Porter and quotes by Thoreau. It
carries the conviction that somehow
we must do what is necessary and
pay the price—which will not be
small.

Dance Board Candidates State Views

Tom Gillespie . . .

One major point of discussion
around Washington and Lee is the
need for a closer university com-
munity and if such an association is
to exist, it must necessarily be based
on understanding and tolerance. To
provide such a basis, open com-
munication will be necessary and my
campaign platform for vice-presi-
dent of the dance board is there-
fore my belief that an attempt must
be made to keep the student body in-
formed as to the workings of the
dance board.

Too many times in past years a
lack of understanding of dance
board operations has brought about
student body resentment toward the
dance board when concerts were not
as enjoyable as expected at the time
when dance plans were purchased.
I realize that such a response is in-
deed justifiable in some circum-
stances, but I feel that through co-

JoJo Martin...

The primary reason that I wish to
serve as Vice-President of the Dance
Board is because of my interest in
music and my desire to bring truly
good music to Washington and Lee
students.

I feel that our concerts should
try to appeal to the tastes of all of
our students. | have found a great
deal of discontent among our stu-
dents and I feel that this is due to
the lack of variety in our concerts.

Music has become such an integ-
ral part of the young people of to-
day that they demand to hear good
music and will settle for nothing
less. Thus, it is the responsibility of
the Dance Board to provide the best
in musical entertainment and _ this
can only be done by bringing top
recording artists to our campus.

Bert Meem...

It is time for a change in the
number and quality of concerts pre-
sented by the Washington and Lee
Dance Board. The present schedule
of four “big weekends” (excluding
Homecomings) with concerts on

generally mediocre entertainment.
The basis of this mediocrity arises
from the dubious financial manage-
ment of the Dance Board.

At present, the Dance Board sells
about 1000 dance plans at forty dol-
lars apiece in September. These
sales result in a meager operating
budget of about $40,000 that is initi-
ally destined to provide us with a
variety of popular groups for four
“big weekends.” Unfortunately, the
end result in May is a general dis-
enchantment with the Dance Board.

Under my tentative proposals we
would have a total of three one-
night “big weekends” plus Fancy
Dress. The concerts would be held

_ From The J-School. . .

  

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

The Senate rejection of Supreme
Court nominee G. Harrold Carswell
was not a conspiracy to keep a
southerner off the Supreme Court,
as President Nixon contends, but
rather a conspiracy to keep mediocre
justices off the Supreme Court.

While it might be true that a
handful of Senators—knee-jerk li-
berals they are called—would not
vote to confirm any conservative, it
is also true that if the President
should nominate a conservative with
the type of outstanding record that
a Supreme Court justice must have,
he would be confirmed with little
opposition. Carswell was simply not
that type of justice.

Four Southern Senators who vot-
ed for Clement Haynesworth—Mar-
low Cook of Kentucky, Albert Gore
of Tennessee, William Fulbright of
Arkansas, and William Spong of
Virginia—voted against Carswell;
not because they have any bias
against the South, but rather because
they could not support a mediocre
justice. These four, as well as many
other Senators, would vote to con-
firm a qualified candidate, no mat-
ter what section of the country he
might be from.

The President's reaction to defeat
was predictable, although puerile.

 

Nixon and Judge Carswell

on Saturday nights preceded Friday
by the usual combo parties and
cocktail parties. Under this plan we
would have one concert weekend
per semester.

With three concerts, each weekend
would initially be alloted an average
of about $12,000 in contrast to ap-
proximately $4500 per concert at

A curtain of disillusionment and
pessimism drapes the W&L student
body when ever one mentions the
entertainment offered by the Dance
Board, One main job of the Vice-

In an obvious political move, de-
signed to further his “Southern
Strategy,” Nixon accused the Senate
of being prejudiced against the
South.

He really had no one to blame
but himself and Attorney General
John Mitchell. In their all out de-
sire to enforce law and order, Nixon
and Mitchell have not only come
up with two bum nominations, but
have also strained relations with the
Senate almost to the breaking point.

Nixon’s accusation of Senate bias
brought immediate and angry reply
from several Senators in both par-
ties.

Senator Cook, a floor leader in
the fight to confirm Haynesworth,
blamed the Attorney General for
that defeat, saying that Mitchell had
antagonized so many Senators that
it was impossible to win confirma-
tion.

Senator Margaret Chase Smith of
Maine was incensed when Presi-
dential Aide Bryce Harlow told
Senator Cook that she had decided
to vote for Carswell. This outright
lie was supposed to influence Sena-
tor Cook to vote for Carswell, but
it only succeeded in assuring a dis-
senting vote by Senator Smith. This
was not the first time the Admini-
stration stooped to deceit.

President has, therefore, is to restore
the optimism, enthusiasm, and anti-
cipation which permeated the atmos-
phere of the campus, student-body,
last year the week before Spring’s
Weekend. This optimism can be
achieved in several ways:

Ist: the V.P. of the Dance Board
must work closely and more effici-
ently with the Dance Board Presi-
dent in an attempt to diversify the
types of music presented consistent
with the desires of the student body,
and, at the same time, we must
strive to sign NAME groups, not
HAS BEENS.

2nd: the V.P. of the Dance Board
must make his presence felt among
the student body, that is to say,
more of a consensus on the type of
music that should be presented must
be achieved if the success of the
Dance Board is to continue while
satisfying the desires of the students.

3rd; the V.P. of the Dance Board
must offer some new concepts con-

Series Split With 0.D.U.

Washington and Lee dropped their
fifth straight game, losing to Vir-
ginia, 13-4, but split a doubleheader
with Old Dominion Saturday to
bring their record to 4-6. The Gen
erals won the first game, 4-0, and
lost the nightcap, 6-3.

Against ODU, Scott MeChrystal
broke open a scoreless battle in the
first game’s sixth inning with a two
run shot over the right centerfield
fence. The Generals scored twice
more in the seventh on Bruce King’s
double and Rat Coates’ pinch single.

Bill Miller toiled four innings, al
lowing only four hits to gain the
victory. King worked three scoreless
innings, fanning three and surrender-
ing one hit.

The Monarchs cut off a last-inn
ing rally to preserve a 6-3 win in
the afterpie. Boots Daugherty al-
lowed only six hits and struck out

seven in his route-going perform-
ance. Freshman Bill French was tag-
ged for the loss.

Old Dominion led 2-1 into the
bottom of the fourth and added
three more off French and Bruce
King. Don McMillan put a close to
that rally, but the Monarchs picked
up a final run in the fifth off Tim
Haley. Bill Greener worked the
sixth inning without further trouble.

Earlier Tuesday, Virginia scored
six big runs in the fifth inning en
route to a 13-4 romp of the Gen-
erals. The Cavaliers put together
four hits, two walks and a hit bats-
man to produce the explosition.
Bruce King, in relief of starter Bill
French, was the loser. Virginia add-
ed four more runs in the seventh,
including catcher Sammy Beale’s
three run homer.

Golfers Perfect, 1-0, So Far

The Washington and Lee golf
team hasn’t had a match in almost a
month, but you won't find the mem-
bers of the team complaining for
they’re enjoying a perfect season.
Of course, there’s only been one
match so far, but W&L won it in
such a convincing manner that
talk of the rest of the season being
perfect should not fall in the cate-
gory of idle conversation.

Coach Cy Twombly has had to
rebuild his team this year for he lost
three out of his first six players
from last year’s starting team. The
69 team was 6-3 and finisher third
in the C.A.C. tournament at the end
of the year. With half that team
now gone, Coach Twombly could
have felt that the long winning tradi-
tion that the golf team has estab-
lished would be threatened. This
doesn’t seem to be the case, how-
ever. Freshmen Jack Marquess and
Brandon Herbert have broken into
the starting lineup and the Coach
feels that the team is even stronger
than last year’s. Returning letter-
men Ken Carter, Dick Singletary,
and Bill Martin form a strong nu-
cleus and Sophomore Bob Story has
also broken into the starting six.

The one and only match so far
this year was against Bucknell on
March 26. W&L was the home team
in a match that was played on the
Upper Cascades course at the Home-
stead. All of W&L’s home matches
will be played at the Homestead this
year because Lexington’s Tri-Brook
course is being expanded to eighteen
holes and the construction makes it
impossible to have matches there

scores, but W&L still looked very

‘Tennis Generals Up |

Court Record to 3-1

By Tom Gage

Coach Verne Canfield’s success-
ful tennis machine is having quite
a season again this year even though
it was squashed by a steamroller in
one of its matches. The team, getting
excellent efforts from all the players,
has compiled a 3-1 record against
pretty tough competition. Akron
University fell to the Generals be-
fore vacation as the Generals sent
them back to Ohio with an 8-1 loss
on their hands and undoubtedly
wishing that they had never dared
to venture into the valley.

Last week’s competition was to
provide the Generals with a true
test of their quality, and by Sunday
Coach Canfield could not have been
too disappointed. His team had
mauled William and Mary 7-2,
squeaked by Hampden-Sydney 5-4,
but had also fallen to renegade
headhunters in Duke uniforms by
the score 8-love. Throughout the
four matches Jeff Driscoll had play-
ed particularly well and captain
Tom McJunkin hadn't been defeated
in a singles match yet.

Not much good can be said about
the Duke match. Bill Gatlin came
the closest to winning a_ singles

match but ended up losing 6-8, 3-6.
Gatlin and Jeff Driscoll put up the
best doubles fight but also lost, this
time by a 4-6, 4-6 margin.

The story’s been different in the
other three matches though. Tom
McJunkin hasn’t let an opponent
come closer than a 6-3 score yet
and also has teamed with Rick Arm-
strong to win doubles matches
against Akron and Hampden-Syd-
ney. But probably the biggest lift
this year has come from the fresh-
man ranks. Coach Canfield had
high hopes at the beginning of the
season for the likes of Marshall
Washburn, Stan Taylor and Taylor
Cooksie, and they haven't let him
down. Aside from Duke match all
foes have fallen before Washburn in
singles and the combination of Tay-
lor-Cooksie has throttled both
William and Mary and Akron op-
ponents in doubles.

Last year’s 8-5 record seems to be
in peril of being improved upon.
Virginia Commonwealth provides
the tennis Generals with their next
opposition as they continue on their
hopefully merry way to a fourth
straight CAC championship. Coach
Canfield does seem to like those
bells.

Cindermen Beat Roanoke

By Dave Torrance

The track team has done an ad-
mirable job so far. They've had two
meets, winning one with Roanoke
College, last year’s state champions,
and losing one to Wake Forest.

In the Roanoke meet, Gary Ent-
sminger won the quarter mile in
§2.5 seconds, not a bad time con-
sidering the team had just returned
from Spring Vacation. Gary also
won the 220. Although Neer hadn't
had much opportunity to practice
the high jump, he defeated Roa-
noke in this event. Bob Carrere won
the javelin throw in only one shot.
His distance was 178 feet. Chris
Friend won the discus throw.

After defeating Roanoke by a
score of 73-72, the Generals went
to Salem, North Carolina to take
on Wake Forest. Although we lost
by a score of 99-46, we distinguish-
ed ourselves in many events, especi-
ally in the field ones. With Mike
Neer unable to participate in the
meet, we were defeated in most of
the running events. However, we
compiled just as many points in field
events as the North Carolina team.

1970 Lacrosse Schedule: April 18,
Baltimore, home; 21, Roanoke,
away; 25, Washington College,
home: 30, Baltimore Loyola, away.

May 2, North Carolina, home; 9,
University of Maryland-Baltimore
County, home; 13, Virginia, home.

Dave Stone jumped 6.1 feet in the
high jump, while Bill Kahn finished
second in the broad jump, with a
fine jump of 21 feet 11/4 inches.
Scotty Scott tied for first in the
pole vault competition, and Paul
Suthern won the high hurdles, our
only running victory. Despite Keith
Shaner’s great time of 202.8 seconds
in the 880, he only finished third.
He also clocked 53 seconds in the
mile relay. Bob Sherwood looked
good in distance running for both
meets.

rhis Thursday, April 14, the team
will play Bridgewater, whom we
haven't beaten in six years, al-
though we came close last year,
losing only by three points. This
year we have a fighting chance to
break the six year jinx.

Nixon’s Demise

With Carswell

(Continued from Page 3)

And the early morning
calls of Martha Mitchell to the Af
kansas Gazette certainly did not en
hance the Attorney General’s popu
larity on Capitol Hill.

Actually Nixon got off to a good
start in Supreme Court nominations
with the choice of Warren Burger as
Chief Justice. Burger was recogniz
ed as a strict constructionist, but
confirmed by the Senate with only
two dissenting votes because he ts a
justice of the highest calibre.

After the defeat of ¢ arswell,
President Nixon should have resols
ed to find a nominee like Burger.
Instead he chose to drive a wedge
between North and South.

It is becoming increasingly ap
parent that the man who said he
was going to bring us together has
done more to pull us apart than
anyone since Joe McCarthy.

Holton Considers Youth, Dissent
In Speech at ODK Convocation

Governor Linwood Holton, W&L
alumnus, returned to his alma mater
yesterday to address the annual
Omicron Delta Kappa Convocation.
In a 15 minute address, Governor
Holton concerned himself with the
problems of youth, the past as rele-
vant to the present and future, and
the difficulties posed by violent pro-
test and dissent

“The past is always relevant to
the future and the present,” Holton
reminded his audience, warning
them that “as Santanya said, “Those
who forget the mistakes of the past
are condemned to repeat them.’ ”

furning to the area of protest,
the governor denounced protest for
its own sake, but classed as benefi-
cial and even essential what he term-
ed “protest for a cause.” However,
he warned that mere dissent is not

enough, pointing out that “we all
know that there are problems, we
can usually identify these problems

But solving these problems requires
affirmative, positive leadership.”

fhe governor told his listeners
that such leadership would have to
come from them and their genera-
tion, and “particularly from the
members of Omicron Delta Kappa.”

Closing his speech, the governor
called for a re-evaluation of the cur-
rent scene, and the utilization of
what he called the “politics of pur-
pose, not merely of protest.”

Holion’s address, which received
a standing ovation from the students
gathered in Lee Chapel, was made
at the occasion of the ODK Tapping
Day ceremony, the 52nd since the
national leadership fraternity was
founded here at WAL in 1918.

operation and a willingness on the
dance board's part to listen to stu-
dent body wishes, this sort of anta-

gonism can be stopped.

I can not say what groups will
be playing next year and | would be
foolish to try to predict such a thing
but I do know that if the members
of the dance board make themselves
aware of student body preferences,
next year’s concerts will be enjoy-
able to the majority of the students
and that the dance board's actions
will be known so that the aura of
secrecy will be gone.

for my petition, several people ex-
pressed their ideas for future con-
cert format. One such suggestion
dealt with the possibility of a pop
festival type concert in a field in-
stead of in a cramped gym. An-
other suggestion dealt with the pos-
sibility of a joint concert weekend
with a girl's school. Both of these
might be enjoyable changes and
perhaps such weekends can be plan-
ned. This type of communication
can bring about the realization of
student body desires and should be
encouraged,

As an elected representative of
the student body, the vice-president
must be receptive and enthusiastic
towards worthwhile changes and
this will be my concern if elected.
The gap between the student body
and the dance board must be closed
and next year’s problems must be
solved to the majority’s satisfaction
or university weekends will lose their
outstanding position at Washington
and Lee.

present, Obviously, with an average
of $7,000 more per concert the
quality of the entertainment would
vastly improve. Also there would
still be about $4,000 for the Fancy
Dress ball which would also be
held during the second semester. In
addition, more popular groups
would help pay for themselves since
more “at the door” tickets would be
purchased by those desiring to see
“big name” groups instead of medio-
cre entertainers. The “at the door”
profits would provide funds which
could be applied toward subsequent
concerts,

The price of dance plans would
still be $40, unless the administra-
tion could be convinced to subsidize
the Dance Board’s activities. “At the
door” tickets would remain at $10
and dance plans would remain non-
transferable. In addition, the student
body would be polled to determine
its entertainment preferences.

Under these tentative proposals
the Dance Board would no longer
be the anathema of the school, but
a proviedr of quality entertainers.
Once again concerts could bring en-
joyment to our campus instead of
two days of disappointment.

I would like to see more jazz and
blues concerts, along with the best
of the current rock groups and indi-
vidual folk artists. | also encourage
holding open air and free campus
concerts,

WAL students have shown a
great deal of musical talent and |
feel that such talent has a place and
should appear, where possible, in
the Dance Board concerts. I feel that
my personal knowledge and taste for
a great variety of music would en-
able me to appeal successfully to
those varied tastes of the student
body.

Different types of music demand
different atmospheres in which to be
performed, Therefore, | would like
tO see concerts where people would
be able to dance, where they could
drink, and outdoor concerts. The
Dance Board is an institution of the
students and if students, as I have
found, become discontented with the
performance of the Board then
some kind of change is necessary. I
would like to instigate such a change
primarily in the type and quality of
our concerts,

petence, and professionalism on one

That Dreams should be compared
to BS&T is not unusual considering
that trumpeter Randy Brecker is a
refugee of the original Blood, Sweat,
and Tears. Randy was featured on
the group’s first album “Child is
Father to the Man,” before he left.
Another familiar face will be that
of bass-player Doug Lubahn who

leader of the now defunct Clear

James Brown, Martha and the Van-

Honor System Reforms,

Coeducation, Community
(Continued from Page 2)

on our football program in the com-

ing years is the only possible alter-

native to co-education.

Robespierre is a classic study in
the inabiilty to cut out a cancerous
growth from an otherwise pure
body. His premise was wrong and
his scalpel terrifying. Yet the
Honor System's absolute penalty
seems to attempt just this. The es-
sence of being a community and a
part of the idea of honor must be a
concern of humanity. It is inhuman
to punish absolutely and irrevocably
for an offense that only in the most
primitive mind implies a thorough-
going lack of honor.

The Executive Committee's Honor
Hearing itself can be an excellent
means of determining violations
when its members strive constantly
to understand the feelings of the
university community and the parti-
cular individual relationship to the
idea of honor. But the only penalty
currently available to the Committee
corrupts the workings of the code,
the code itself, and the university
community. We can and must have
an Honor System that works and yet
promotes a sense of permanent
membership in the community. We
must allow people to rehabilitate
themselves.

avoid the dullness of routine-——one
of the causes of the existent dissatis-

faction.

Last: the V.P. of the Dance
Board is in charge of co-ordinating
the advisory council — a group of
sophomores and juniors represent-
ing the fraternities and non-frater-
nity men. If a consensus is to be a-
chieved, this entity must function
efficiently.

Thus, the V.P. of the Dance
Board assumes an important posi-
tion because his success or failure at
achieving an optimistic atmosphere
among the student body could very
well determine the success or ulti-
mate destruction of the Dance
Board in the years ahead.

band until his turn comes to tell it
his way—one rim-shot from Cob-
ham can say more than the entire
output of a Ginger Baker.”

That this talented new group has
yet to release an album is no acci-
dent. Their managers have refused
to let them cut one until they have
completed a wide circuit of con-
certs, thus assuring an instant hit.

Dreams will open their concert in
Doremus Friday night at 8:15. Sat-
urday night’s Richie Havens concert
will also be at 8:15. The weekend
will officially begin Friday after-
noon with the University Cocktail
