A NEWS ANALYSIS

IFC Self-Study

By John Robinson

In the last academic year two fra-
ternities have folded at W&L and
many individuals predict an increase
of this phenomenon next fall. At an
opportune time the IFC has receiv-
ed an forward-looking, 22 page self-
study that, if implemented, may halt
or curtail this trend.

Seven months in the making, this
report encompasses six basic fields
of fraternity interest, i.e., IFC struc-
ture, academics, social activities,
house construction, labor and food-
buying. Each field was carefully ex
amined and possible solutions to
existing problems were presented

The structure of the IFC was
found by the IFC Study Committee
to be far from efficient. Two major
stumbling blocks to efficient IFC
operations were classified as “a lack
of communication ... and a lack of
motivation.” To eliminate these
problems, a different voting proce
dure was recommended. This recom
mendation was that one vote be
awarded fraternity
dent, each fraternity IFC representa
and each IFC officer on the
Judicial Board.” ¢ urrently,

EC Discusses Publication A bpropriations;
Debates Increase of Student Payments

“As of last Friday morning, the
strike people took over the expenses
of their phone calls,” explained Sta-
man Ogilvie at Monday night’s EC
meeting. The expenses of the Strike
Committee were discussed with re-
gard to the money appropriated
Ogilvie by the EC last Monday,
which was to be used for a newslet-
ter and an information center.

The funds allocated by the EC
last week are now being restricted to
the publication of the newsletter.
The Strike Committee has organiz-
ed itself and has requested official
recognition by the EC as a student
body organization.

This request was presented to the
EC Monday night. The group sought
recognition in order to be able to
use the facilities of the Student Cen-
ter and to get a telephone without
paying the twenty-five dollar deposit.
Virginia Telephone and Telegraph
Company does not require the de-
posit from officially recognized stu-
dent body organizations.

Alan Prater introduced a motion
to recognize the Strike Committee,
which passed unanimously.

See Editorial Comment, Page 2

 

 

Larry Honig, President of the
Publications Board, appeared be-
fore the EC to request a 34 cent
raise in the student tax, to go into
the Publications Board reserve fund.

A motion was introduced by Alan
Prater to allow the raise in the stu-
dent tax. The motion was seconded
by Ogilvie and passed unanimously,

W&L Moot Court Tournaments
Cite Markham, Gardner, Annand

A distinguished panel of judges
last week chose John J. E. Mark-
ham Hl, a freshman law student
irom Cambridge, Mass., as captain
of next year’s W&L National Moot
Court team.

Markham was chosen on the basis
performance in the final
round of the 1970 Burks Moot Court
Competition. Also selected for the
ieam Philip G. Gardner of
Martinsville, first arguing member,

of his

were

the four King-tum Phi Award recipients, (1. to r.) Marvin C.

and Stephen D. Annand of Charles-
ton, W.Va., second arguing mem-
ber.

Federal District Judges Ted Dal-
ton and H. Emory Widener and
Maryland Circuit Judge J. DeWeese
Carter presided over the final argu-
ment, which climaxed a semester-
long competition in which each
freshman law student wrote a brief
and argued a case involving mental
injury.

'

Henberg, Robert T. Schooley,

A motion was also introduced
and passed to reconsider this motion
next year,

Dan Silberberg, Interim Chair-
man for the Mock Convention, re-
quested an appropriation of $300
for summer expenses of the Mock
Convention. He indicated that the
money would be spent to have a
booklet printed, as well as for sta-
tionery and stamps for two mass
mailings by state and region chair-
men,

Dean Kumpuris pointed out that

the EC had paid for $400 of bad
accounts on the 1968 Convention,
and at the rate that funds were be-
ing requested, the EC would “end
up giving $1,000 to the Mock Con-
vention before it was all over.”

Staman Ogilvie suggested that Sil-
berberg send letters to parents re-
questing donations, and then finance
the alumni campaign with that
money.

The EC voted to allocate $100 to
Silberberg for the purpose of re
questing money from parents.

EC Selects Committees

The 1970-71 Executive Commit-
tee named its Standing Committees
after a series of interviews conduct-
ed last week.

Drew Kumpuris, a rising senior
from Little Rock, Ark., was named
chairman of the Student Control
Committee. His committee will in-
clude Bill Cole, Rick Gray, Rob
Turnbull, Terry Tyler, Steve Ory,
John Trimper and Andrew Wynd-
ham.

The newly designated University
Center-Orientation Committee will
be chaired next year by JoJo Mar-
tin, a rising junior from Midland,
Texas. Larry Miller, a rising sen-
ior from Richmond, will edit next
year’s handbook. Other committee-
men will include Stan Harris, Smitty
Smith, Bob Bruyere, Bert Winkler,

REVIEW and OUTLOOK Two Presidents Look At The Future

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, May 20, 1970

The “Nonpartisan” Newsletter

Amid the hectic atmosphere of crisis which characterized
the W&L campus in the past two weeks, the Executive Com-
mittee, in the heat of the moment, authorized Mr. Staman
Ogilvie to oversee an unlimited emergency fund to finance
long distance telephone calls and a “Campus Newsletter.”
The EC’s intent was to disseminate urgently needed factual
news of fast-breaking events to the students, parents and
alumni of Washington and Lee.

According to Mr. Ogilvie, their purpose in allocating
these funds was to provide information which would “get our
own story out to parents and alumni” who were out of touch
with the events on campus, and to “‘stop the rumor mill” by
distribution of the newsletter here on campus. All information
to be given out was to be (again in Mr. Ogilvie’s words) “non-
partisan.”

Well, after W8&L was named “South Central Strike Head-
quarters” by the National Strike Committee, Mr. Ogilvie put
an end to the student body’s subsidization of long distance
telephone calls made by unauthorized people who were in-
tensely involved in the Strike movement. (One EC member
remarked that when he confronted what he thought to be an
unauthorized student using the information telephone
to make a long distance call, the student claimed, “I was given
authority by Ovilgie.”)

Although the student body is no longer paying for the
“South Central Strike Headquarters’ ” calls, it is still financ-
ing the publication of the “Campus Newsletter,” supposedly
a non-biased, factual presentation of the most recent events
on this campus and elsewhere.

In a perusal of the May 18 edition of the newsletter,
however, we found the following examples of “non-partisan”
reporting:

“The following is the text of the first major news confer-
ence of the South Central HQ at Washington and Lee on
Sunday, May 17, at 2 p.m.”

This comprised the headline for the text which followed it,
an excerpt of which is printed below. Nowhere in the newslet-
ter is there a statement of authorship for the text, other than
a recurrent “we” in the text and the mention of the “South
Central HQ” in the headline.

“|. There are many people in this country who read the
Bible, pledge allegiance to the flag, demand laws and order,
and then call themselves Americans. These people deplore
pornography, deplore protest, deplore other people. But
when it comes to the greatest of all their sins, they harbor,
they condone, they rationalize, they embrace murder. These
people are not holy, these people are not Americans, these
people are barely human beings. They pay for and vote for
murder in the name of flags, gods, countries, soldiers. These
people are the outlaws for they are the murderers by proxy.
Three headlines on the newsletter read: “Right On Jeff,”
“Movement For A New Congress,” and “Needed Badly: A
Ham Operator With Own Set, willing to aid the W&L Strike
headquarters with communications.”

And finally, from an article entitled “Report From Vir-
ginia Tech,” there is this brief remark about the student
strike: “Apathy is still the problem at Tech, as shown by the
2800 votes for either a strong or a weak strike and the 2400
votes in opposition to any strike.”

From this sort of content, it should be most obvious that
the “non-partisan” “Campus Newsletter” is, in reality, bla-
tantly partisan—in favor of the student strike. Which is fine.

Except that the student body is financing its publication.
We ask that the EC take one of three courses of action re-
garding the future of this newsletter: (1) Take away all stu-
dent body financial support immediately; or (2) quickly en-
sure that its future publication will not be marred by bald
instances of prejudice such as have been printed above; or
(3) state officially that it, as a governing body, supports the
partisanship typical of the May 18 newsletter.

We ask this not so much in the name of some journalistic
ideal of objectivity (which we, alas, continually fail to realize) ;
but rather in the name of responsible student government—
one that acknowledges, one way or the other, what its stand

is. : —L. L. Me.

By Swede Henberg
Student Body President

During the past weeks, several
issues of extreme importance have
been brought to the attention of
Washington and Lee students. Be-
ginning as a recognition of and an
interest in national issues, the stu-
dent mobilization on this campus
inevitably raised the question of
who controls the University—or,
rather, who should control the Uni-
versity.

From my viewpoint, it seems that
a great majority of student com-
plaints about the recent faculty ac-
tion stem from an unwillingness to
recognize what constitutes a uni-
versity. “We are now,” a student in-
sisted upon telling his fellows, and
I would agree. But the force behind
his remarks seemed to indicate that
for this reason students have no ob-
ligation to try and perceive future
ramifications of their action.

I would argue that ‘Now’ is pos-
sible only insofar as it is constituted
by past actions and future expecta-
tions. If this is true, the statement
“we are now” implies a concern for
the future of Washington and Lee
that I sense is lacking among many
students who have raised the issue
of control over the University.

The issue of student responsibiilty
and control did not spring full-
blown from the head of last week's
student resolution. Earlier this year,
the Executive Committee recom-
mended and had generally accepted
a number of changes in the constitu-
tion of faculty/student committees.
No doubt the sphere of student in-
fluence deserves further augmenta-
tion—but not before a careful con-
sideration of prior questions has
been undertaken.

One of those questions that must
first be answered is who should con-
trol the University. I will not at-
tempt dealing with this matter be-
yond pointing out its importance to
future action. The aspiration to
power on the part of students must
be shown to be a responsible interest
that goes beyond the intense, transi-
tory emotion of a few days or a few
weeks. The focus of my remarks will
be upon what I think must be done
before this issue of student respon-
sibility can be raised in any substan.
tive manner.

What the past few weeks have em-
phasized in my mind is the archaic
structure of student government at
Washington and Lee. As long as the
Student Body remained a largely
disinterested entity, | think the in-
stitution of an Executive Committee
was a viable one. Clearly, however,

 

our own deficiencies as to having an
effective Student Body organization
were shown up during the last few
weeks.

A twelve member Executive Com-
mittee simply could not respond to
the issues and at the same time give
students the feeling of participation
that was called for. The sort of in-
formal groups which arose are en-
tirely commendable—the Cockpit
sessions, etc, But out of this morass
rose the call for a student resolution
that was contradictory and, in my
opinion, could give to the faculty
no clear view as to what students
actually wanted.

All this, of course, is past history,
but one problem remains of affect-
ing a working option. To take a
pose from Joe Tompkins’ campaign,
I think we need a student senate ex-
panded to perhaps twenty-five or
thirty members. There may indeed
be some sacrifice of efficiency as
concerns internal working, but I
think the benefits would outweigh
the disadvantages.

Thus I would urge next year’s Exe-
cutive Committee and our Student
Body first to turn their attention to
the problem of their own organiza-
tion. Until some more effective
means of representation is possible,
the request for further student pre-
rogative is a vacuous one.

in some strange way, it is always
pleasurable, after high-intensity
events, to say “I was there!” Or to
remember exactly what one was do-
ing when one heard about, say,
Bobby Kennedy's death. It is a form
of resavoring the pain and excite-
ment, And there is an even greater
satisfaction in telling about past
events which have happened to you.

There have been some fascinating
talkers-about-myself in literature.
There is reporting on historical hap-
penings that went on before their
eyes: such as Mrs. Chestnut’s ir-
repressible “Diary from Dixie”. She
was close enough to the Confederate
seats of power to describe with sharp
wit and sincere emotion many events
of the Civil War. She was endlessly
curious and just plain hated it down
on the plantation. What's more she
never knew that her diary would
ever be seen by anyone.

The “Education of Henry Adams”

By Fran Lawrence
Student Body President-Elect

The last few weeks’ activity has
both presented the basic problem at
Washington and Lee and provided
the fire needed to find the solutions
to these problems. What is the Uni-
versity? What is its relationship to
the nation? What determines Uni-
versity policy? How can views be
best represented?

The relationship here between
faculty and students has both bro-
ken down and been reaffirmed. A
new, deeper level of communication
has ensued from the apparent break-
down of real dialogue May 12.

Next year’s student government
must work, beginning now, to make
an understandable relationship of de-
cision-making in the entire Univer-
sity. All groups must recognize in
what areas special knowledge and
interest lies in any single group.
There is no question in my mind but
that students must take an increas-
ingly important role in determining
the direction and policy of this Uni-
versity. Those who would bear all
responsibility and power must share
both with students in more real
ways.

The Executive Committee must

continue to work as a governing
body in providing a non-political

First Person Singular

the interaction of outward events
upon the mind and sensitivity of «
truly articulate and intelligent man.
No one who hopes to understand
what the blacks of this country are
fighting against can get by without
a receptive reading of the “Auto-
biography of Malcolm X”. Required
reading for all human beings.

And there are others—greatly di-
verse—from the poignant “Diary of
Anne Frank” to Jerry Kramer's tale
of life in Vince Lombari’s Green
Bay Packers: “Instant Replay”.
President Nixon speaks in calm re-
trospect of his “Six Crises”, — while
one lives through (?) his seventh.

“Speak, Memory” by Nabokov,
one of the great stylists of his adopt-
ed language, English: “Memoirs”
by George Kennon and “Anti-Me-
moirs’ by Andre Malraux offer
widely different recollections of life
in Western Europe in recent decades.

Then after such listings, comes a
strange feeling that in some small
part, each writer is talking about
each one of us. Ourselves, yet!

structure that provides for local and
national activities. We must broaden
our basis of operation to include the
greatest number of people either
through extended committee activity
or constitutional revision.

| will work for a new emphasis
our town relations by an Inter-
Relations Committee. It will en-
courage the continuing interchange
of ideas and understanding between
town and University, promote a
sense of the University’s responsibil-
ity to the town, and mediate griev-
ances within the Lexington-W&L
community. As well, a committee
will be set up to help publicize and
coordinate campus activities. It will
work with. the University Center
Committee and the Free University
as well as other organizations to en-
courage a rich and varied program
of events.

The Free University has been set
up on a continuing basis as a flex-
ible non-political forum to provide
for education not a part of the cur-
rent curriculum, It has a student-
faculty directorship which will be
responsive to any members of the
community who wish to work with
and formulate “curriculum.”

In a more dynamic and involved
situation it becomes increasingly im-
portant to have a foundation of
mutual trust and respect among
members of the community. This, I
believe, is the essence of the Honor
System. We must extensively ef-
amine it and modify its penalty or
procedure not by way of denying its
importance as a basis for a real
community, but rather to reinforce
that importance in a community
that has undergone constant evolu-
tion since 1749,

The University must come up
with a new concept of housing in
the very immediate future. A void
must not be created by the changing
priorities toward fraternities. Stu-
dents must respond to this challenge
with creative ideas for housing that
is readily available for groups of
people who wish to live in a dorm-
like community but not in a dorm or
fraternity house. Perhaps the Uni-
versity should expand the Dutch
Inn type set-up to upperclassmen.

The Executive Committee must
broaden its own concepts, and those
of the University. At the same time,
it must provide new opportunities
and facilities in the current struc
tures for the varied forms of expres-
sion that are now emerging. Wash-
ington and Lee is in a great and ex-
citing transition, a revolution, and
we will have to work to capture all
the energy of this event towards
building an incomparable Univer-

No Official YR Stand

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:

As President of the Young Re-
publican club at WAL, I have been
the target of a great deal of criticism
in the past week for the alleged acti-
vities of the club in trying to keep
the university open.

The Young Republicans as a club
took no stand whatsoever, cither for
or against, the student body referen-
dum of May 11, 1970. It did not
endorse either side in any way. It is
true that many Young Republicans,
with the help of many others includ-
ing Young Democrats, were active
in the campaign to defeat the refer-
endum. By personal observation, |
noticed at least an equal number of
club members working quite actively
to close the university.

I, personally, have no idea how
the majority of the membership felt
towards the issue. Indeed, the Exe-
cutive Board of the Young Republi-
cans felt it could not take a stand
for this very reason.

Stephen M. Finley, ‘72

Future W&L Implications

To the Editor of The Ringtum Phi:

Last week's crisis at Washington
and Lee over the issue of concern
has terminated. If one atiempts to
piace the situation in perspective,
he will see that there are further
implications for the University—that
issues raised last week did not die
with last week.

A governing body musi be able to
comply reasonably with the desires
of those which it administers in or-
der to maintain their support. The
faculty is such a governing body,
and the students comprise the body
which is administered.

At WAL there are two general
governing spheres. The academic
sphere is subdivided beiween siu-
dent and faculiy government. The
Executive Commiliee and standing
student body commuitees constitute
a sub-sphere. and the faculty con
slittiies the other sub-sphere. The In

terfraternity Council, the Interfra-
ternity Council Judicial Board, and
the Student Control Committee act
as a legislature and judiciary for the
social sphere.

The social sphere and half the
academic sphere are readily respon-
sive to student needs because these
spheres are comprised solely of stu-
dents. As evidenced by the percent-
age of the student body voting in
favor of the resolution and the fac-
ulty's non-compliance with the major
points embodied therein, the faculty
is perhaps not readily responsive to
student needs. (in all fairness it must
be said that the faculty did have
valid reasons for coming to its con-
clusions.)

At this juncture the faculty must
become aware of the implications of
their decision. The students—re-
sponsibility, rationally, and indeed
nobly-——sought to have their desires
brought to fruition by working with-
in the system of government. Stu-
dent sentiment was made quite clear
by the voting.

It is a general feeling that these
desires were not satisfied by the
course of action which the faculty
chose to take. The question musi be
raised: in the future when there is
again such a strong feeling. will the
students work within the existing
sysiem of government? The answer
is probably “no.” Then it becomes
evident that there must be a change
in the constitution of the governing
body. If this does not occur, the
possibiliiy of violence—the only
other aliernative — cannot be dis-
missed,

It is the responsibility of the fac
ulfy to see that change comes so
that students will feel they have a
posilive course of action io under-
take. One possible answer is the es-
tablishment of a senate. This body
would be comprised of facully and
students, predominately the former
of it has no chance of being initially
esiablished. The senaie would then
act as a legislature for the affair
now handled by the faculty. (The
faculiy must sill exerce complete
control over grades and the grading

system.)

Another alternative is the place-
ment of more students on the stand-
ing faculty committees: the Execu-
tive Committee, the Committee on
Courses and Degrees, etc. (The re-
constitution of the Student Affairs
Committee is quite satisfactory.)
These students must have voting
rights. In effect these committees
present advice which is generally
followed by the faculty. In addition
the president of the student body
ought to be present for the entirety
of faculty meetings.

A change in the faculty's portion
of the academic sphere of govern-
ment is necessary. The expressed
manner in which this government
would be altered is purely persona!
feeling for a viable change. It is cer-
tainly not the general feeling of the
studemt body because that feeling
has not as yet been mobilized.

I was genuinely pleased with the
student response to the faculty's re-
solution. It is my earnest hope that
the faculty will make a genuine
response to the Washington and Lee
student body.

Return To Normaley?

To the Editor of The Ring-tum Ph:

If the administration of this uni
versity (1 use the term “university”
with a degree of dowbi) is under
some apprehension that WAL will
make a “return to normalcy,” 1
hope that they will be mistaken.

if normalcy is checking in for
classes and then scattering off down
the hill. I hope it will be only an
illusion. If normalcy is remaining in
isolation from the problems of our
world, | hope again that they will be
wrong.

| hope that the administration
does not call into question the in-
tellectual curiosity of the students.
For if they do so, they would be, in
a sefise, condemning their own a f-
ling reactions. Hypocrisy is not en-
viible or respectable

ihe faculty action on the saudeni

resolution showed, if nothing else,
where the students stand in the ad-
minisiration’s eyes — NOWHERE:
If a list of administration priorities
were drawn up, it seems probable
that the establishment of a Univer
sity Community would choke to
death on some “shifting sands.”
But all is not lost. Even though
the Indo-China issue transcends all
others in urgency, there is one ques-
tion which is going to arise again
and again and again. When is
Washington and Lee going to stop
this educational stagnation and re-
turn from its I88-year road trip?
Peter J. Faillace, Jr., ‘73

A Change In Concern

fo the Editor of The Ring-tum Phi:
When I was a student at Washing-
ton and Lee, there was a general
feeling of apathy and uninvolve-
ment throughout almost every sector
of the campus community. People
were more concerned with their
weekend date. or tubing at Goshen,
or Finals Weekend, or some other
event which at thal time even |
thought to be more important than
politics, or the drafi, or the war,
WAL is rather isolated from the
rest of civilization and it's easy to
tune out on all thal’s ecing on oui
side of Rockbridge County.
However. | dont know how it ik
back there now. Things might have
changed. I only hope they have. and
that there is concern over the recent
invasion of Cambodia and over the
deaths of four fellow students only
three or four siates away. You don‘:
have fo go to extremes like at Berk
ley or Maryland or even here at
Sianiord, bul you can do some con
sirtuctive things like sending a fac
ulfy-student delegation to Washing
ton or by writing letters to € ongress,
ele
Finals Weekend won't be endan
eered, Goshen won't be shut down,
but maybe the world and thik caun
try will be a little more straightened
out. Think about i
