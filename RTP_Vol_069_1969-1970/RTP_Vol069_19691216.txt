UFOC service
in R. E. Lee
Church tonight

Ancient ceremony used

PARTY FOR TOWN
CHILDREN PLANNED

At 7:15 p.m. this evening, a
Christmas Candlelight Service will
be held at Robert E. Lee Memorial
Episcopal Church. This event was
signaled by the ringing of church
bells throughout Lexington this af-
ternoon. The theme of the service
will be “Peace on Earth, Good Will
Towards Men”,

The service will consist of eight
lessons with carols—a_ traditional
form of service for corporate wor-
ship at the Christmas season, The
purpose of these lessons is to tell
the sacred history from the Crea-
tion of Man to the Incarnation,

This ancient form of service was
first revived for modern use at Truro
in Cornwall. It is annually broad-
east from King’s College Chapel in
Cambridge and is widely used in
schools and colleges in America as
well as England.

This year’s lesson readers include
Professor James Loesel, Lt. Colonel
Jack Morris, Dean John Mehl,
Dean David Sprunt, Maurice Leach,

Robert Herring, Robert Entzmin-
ger, Edward Bracken and Jeffrey
Spence.

However the custom is being
somewhat altered, for up until now
this form of service consisted of nine
lessons instead of eight. The final
lesson will be replaced by a period
of meditation which will allow par-
ticipants to pause and reflect on the
season’s meaning as well as the
Christian message in all, Thus the
service will provide a plea for uni-
versal peace and good will.

The John A. Graham Brass Choir
and the Washington and Lee Glee
Club will be participating in the 45
minute service. Also, the organist
for the evening will be Col. George
Ross. The service is sponsored by
the University Federation of Con-
cern,

The Christmas offering will pro-
vide support for the annual Christ-
mas Basket Program of the Rock-
bridge County Welfare Department

Thirty-one underprivileged  chil-
dren will be treated to a Christmas
party on Thursday afternoon, De
cember 18, at Central School. The
party is sponsored by the University
Federation of Concern jointly with
Lambda Chi Alpha and Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon. John McCardell, a
Lambda Chi involved in the plann-
ing, reports cheerfully that each
child will receive a present, and that
a Christmas tree and Santa Claus,
portrayed by Jim Gilliam, a Lamb
da Chi, will be provided,

The children are members of two
special classes for the underpri
vileged and slow learners, in age 8-
12 and 12-15.

Meanwhile, the University will
celebrate the holiday with two events
—the Troubadour production of
King Lear and the annual W&L In
vitational Basketball Tournament.

The Troub show will play tonight
through Thursday, with the curtain
raising at 8:30. The basketball tour
nament is slated for Thursday and
Friday nights with games at 7:00
and 9:00. The four games will be
played among a four team field

Joe Tompkins called last night's
Executive Committee meeting to
order in Swede Henberg’s absence
Tompkins announced the following
EC meeting will be on Tuesday,
January 6.

The highlight of the meeting was
the subcommittee report from the
committee investigating the recruit-
ment of underprivileged students
Chairman Dave Bethea divided the
committee into five subcommittees
when the first meeting became “un-
weildly.” Fifteen to eighteen people
were present and five subcommitices
were formed to study improvement,
financial aid, admissions problems,
recruitment programs, and policy
relating to the underprivileged ap-
plicants.

Many of the subcommitices’ work
overlapped. Rob Schatz reported on
admissions problems. Pleas Geyer
reported on recruitment. Stuart Fau
ber reported on a proposed assimila-
tion program for underprivileged
students and Steve Robinson report-
ed on policy. Many proposals were
made and criticized by both the
Executive Committee and the fe
cruiting committee.

Actions on the proposals
tabled until after the Christmas
holidays. John Markham proposed
that the committee be allowed to
continue their studies until the last
meeting in February before making
their final report. The motion passed
unanimously.

Glenn Miller Orchestra to be
featured at Fancy Dress Ball

Plans for Fancy Dress Weekend
have crystalized and the Dance
Board has announced that the week-
end’s entertainment will be headed
by the world famous Glenn Miller
Orchestra led by Buddy DeFranco.
The renowned band will appear Fri-
day, January 20 in Evans Dining
Hall. Dress will be black tie and
the theme has not yet been an-
nounced.

The Glenn Miller Orchestra was
established by the late Glenn Mille:
in 1937. For three and a half years,
the Glenn Miller Orchestra rode the
waves as America’s Number One
Band. Its liquid reeds with the uni
que clarinet lead, the ooh-wah brass,
the romantic ballads, the jumping
swing numbers, and the imaginative
novelties all combined to win mil
lions of fans the world over—both
young and old.

Among the more famous hits of
the original band were “Moonlight
Serenade,” “In the Mood,” “The St.
Louis Blues,” “Kalamazoo,” and
“Tuxedo Junction.” The Glenn Mil-
ler recording of the “Washington
and Lee Swing” is undoubtedly one
of the finest renditions.

Glenn Miller was killed during
World War II and the band was led
for ten years by Ray McKinley

Buddy DeFranco assumed the direc-
tion of the band shortly thereafter.
rhe orchestra has enjoyed their posi

tion as the largest record selling
popular orchestra in the United
States. Their records include “The

Glenn Miller Orchestra returns to
Glen Island Casino”, “The Glenn
Miller Orchestra ‘Makes the Goin’
Great”, and “Do you Wanna
Dance”, just released by Command
Records. The orchestra has receiv-
ed acclaim in Lake Tahoe, Cali
fornia, Las Vegas, and New York’s
Waldorf Astoria. The group has also
conducted hundreds of one night en-
gagements.

Buddy DeFranco has been recog-

nized by Down Beat and Metronome
magazines as the number one clari-
netist in the country. He was picked
by the Glenn Miller Foundation to
lead the Glenn Miller Band for his
mastery of his instrument and_ his
ability to emulate the “Glenn Miller
sound”, DeFranco has appeared at
New York’s Carnegie Hall and the
Hollywood Bowl in solo perfor-
mances. He previously played with
the bands of Scat Davis, Gene Kru-
pa, Ted Fio Rita, Charlie Barnet,
Tommy Dorsey, and Boyd Raeburn.

Tickets are available in the co-op

“Lear” to premiere tonight:
“A VISION of life and action”

By Lawrence McConnell

Fonight at 8:30 the lights will go
down on the audience in the Trou-
badour Theatre and will come up
on Act I, Scene 1 of a Shake-
spearian tragedy, So? If one could
make a survey of plays which are
opening on the week of December
15-21 in theatres around the coun-
try, at least 10 Shakespearian pro-
ductions would be listed in the tally.

The Troubadour production is ad-
mittedly insignificant in this re-
spect. So, the question becomes why
put on Shakespeare just because it's
Shakespeare? If the Troubadour
Theatre were producing “King
Lear” under this premise, they'd be
wiser tO save some money on their
light bills this week.

But the theatre is not “doing
Shakespeare” just because of some
maxim in theatre circles that it
should be done. Actually, by taking
on “King Lear”, the theatre is at-
tempting to re-orient one of Shake-
speare’s plays in particular and to
go against the grain of Shakespeare
imterpretation in general. Shake
speare is continually mangled by
two eXtremes of productions. One
group holds that Shakespeare must
“relate” to our up-to-date, ‘au cour-
ant, intellectuality and must of
necessity be staged with the intent
of revealing some undiscovered
meaning to our society. The other
group of people tend to force upon
audiences the plays as they would
have been produced in the 1590's
and 1600's, complete with “tragic
emotions’ and “how-now-brown

cow” rhetoric.

Both of these groups fail to pro-
duce good theatre, let alone good
Shakespeare. Trying to divorce it-
self from the playwright totally,
the former’s productions accomplish
an admirable separation, but the ali-
mony of meaning is irrevocably lost.
The latter is so betrothed to the au-
thor that the offspring to the produc-
tion is almost robot-like. The Trou-
badour production sidesteps both
these pitfalls, rejecting them for
what the play is: “a vision of life”
(to quote Kirk Woorward in the
Friday Ring-tum Phi, Dec. 12).

Once any statement is made con-
cerning what a Shakespearian play
is, criticism rears its eggshaped head
from all sides; but the current pro-
duction tries to avoid interpretation
and communication of any esoteric
meaning, and to present the “life”
in “King Lear”. The play is a story
of an old king who gives up his
land to his two older daughters,
denying the third any part of the
kingdom because she would not say
that she loved him. At the end the
old king after his youngest
daughter is hanged. Of course, this
isn't the whole story, but all of it
follows this general fairy tale type
drift. Fairy Sure—until you
see the characters come alive. And
this, finally, is the end result of the
Troubadours’ productions: to re-
enact the “True Chronicle History of
the Life and Death of King Lear
and His Three Daughters, .” to give
it life and action, not “relevance”

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Tuesday, December 16, 1969

‘A clear mandate’

“A giant step was taken Wednesday in the direction of an
independent exam schedule,” reported the Friday Edition.
Let us hope that this optimism is warranted.

A gratefully large number of concerned students turned
out in the rain to express their opinions in favor of the pro-
posals of the Student Curriculum Committee. Ninety per-
cent of those voting indicated their belief that an independent
examination schedule would not unduly tax the Honor Sys-
tem. Ninety-six per cent favored the establishment of a sys-
tem of independent scheduling of examinations.

Chairman Chip Schooley of the Curriculum Committee
has stated that his committee in co-ordination with the stu-
dent body Executive Committee will now draft, for presenta-
tion to the faculty, a resolution endorsing an independent

exam schedule.

We feel that the faculty will mow recognize what Mr.
Schooley has called “a clear mandate” to them to move in
the direction of an independent examination schedule. This
should result in the formulation of a system of exam schedul-
ing which at long last will prove satisfactory to both the
faculty and the student body as a whole.

A representative at large

We commend the action of Mr. Bob Trout and the In-
terfraternity Council in petitioning the Faculty Executive
Committee to allow an IFC member to attend faculty meet-
ings. We fully agree with our Friday counterpart that such
representation is a basic student right and that it would fur-
thermore serve to remind the faculty of student interests in

their regular monthly meetings.

We also feel that the advantages accrued by such repre-
sentation would pertain to the student body as a whole.
Therefore, we question the wisdom of having a student pri-
vileged to sit with the faculty (should such a situation be ap-
proved), committed to a special interest group such as the

IFC,

We would like to express our belief that since a repre-
sentative of this type would by nature of his office stand for
the interests of the entire student body, then such a repre-
sentative should be elected by the entire student body, We
therefore encourage the Executive Committee of the student
body to investigate this issue with the perspective of the entire

student body in mind.

Lottery’s effect dissipated
Non incautus futuri

By C. Turner

What it has done to us is dis-
turbing. Should I say what it has
not done to us is disturbing? The
anxiety that psyched-up all of us
before the results of the lottery
were announced is now gone. That
question which affronted us all—that
was “real”. I'm sorry it has dissi-
pated.

Some of the people | know who
got a “fat” number are now trying
to figure out how to break their
ROTC contracts. Others are think-
ing of quitting school and traveling
maybe to Europe or Mexico. They
are out of it.

Many of those I know who got a
low number have accepted it as if
God himself (wearing a grey suit
and a dark tie) had drawn their
number from the fish bowl; or, at
least long ago, he set the thing go-
ing so that their birth was on such

Code for faint of heart

By Boh Webb

With the advent of the lottery,
many of us in the first third of the
list (1 am number 22) have found
ourselves wishing we had spent an
extra day or so in mother’s warm
womb, But such wishful thinking
must be abandoned as we turn our
thoughts to soldiering in an even
warmer Vietnam.

Who hasn't seen the blood and
guts John Wayne military hero re-
citing the “Uniform Code of Mili-
tary Conduct” in the cinema. His
rock jaw barely moves as he pledges
through gritted teeth to be loyal,
courageous, cheerful, thrifty, brave.

us are really like this? For those of
us who aren't, | have revised the

Swimmers win; marks fall

By Reeve Kelsey

Records fell as the blue swimming
team easily defeated Dickinson
College in their first home meet of
the year. Coach Stearn’s swimmers
now have a 1-1 record for the sea-
son. Freshman Alan Corwith shaved
four seconds off of the 200 yard
freestyle school and pool record as
he captured a first in that event with
a 1:44.6 second score. Bim Clark,
last year's most improved swimmer,
kept improving and seized the school
and pool record in the tough 200
yard butterfly event with a 1:59.5
second performance.

the Generals began their 62-42
victory with a stunning perfor
mance in the 400 yard mediey relay
finishing almost two lengths ahead
of the Dickinson team. Hal Catlin.
Price Blackford, Bim Clark, and
co-captain Roger Martin combined
in this event for a 3:42.4 finish. The
Generals kept the pressure on as
Hert Meem and co-captain Scott
McElroy went 1-2 in the second
event—the 43 length 1000 yard
freestyle

then came Corwith’s superb per
formance in the 200 yard freestyle
event followed by David Kympton
who captured a second in that race
After three events, the Generals had
a commanding 23-2 lead, and Coach
Siearn’s began to reiax the pressure
on the Dickinson team

Brumback glided to an easy first
in the SO yard freestyle event by
simost a body length in an event
more often than not decided by in

and such day and now the situation
has churned itself out according to
some secret order so that this is just
another war and as it happens now
they are supposed to fight it.

However, the lottery has merely
begged the question of the nature of
the involvement in Vietnam. As
long as the United States fights in
that small country, we are involved
and responsible whether or not we
are pulling triggers or bomb-sight
mechanisms, or putting another nic-
kel in and punching pinball flippers.
Even will-less passivity is a committ-
ment and is inexcusable. (P.S. Can-
ada is just another place.)

How long can we believe Presi-
dent Nixon's rhetoric: either, we
win and have peace, or the commies
will butcher all those nice inno-
cent people? Wouldn't you call the
user of massive fire power within a
civilian population a butcher?

Debate trophies number 101
im ten years; eleven for fall

Successful debating over the past
weekend has pushed the number of
trophies earned by Washington and
Lee University’s debate team over
the 100 mark for the past decade.

Washington and Lee’s debaters
won three of the eight trophies that
were awarded at the Madison Col-
lege Tournament in Harrisonburg.
The University of Richmond also
won three trophies, and the State
University of New York at Oswego
won two. W&L has now collected
101 trophies in the past 9% years.

W&L Debate Coach William W.
Chaffiin noted that in the past 10
years, Washington and Lee’s tro-
phies have come from as far north
as Dartmouth, as far west as North-
western, and as far south as Miami.

W&L debaters John Reynolds of
Houston, Texas and Kenny Murov
of Shreveport, La., along with Uni-
versity of Richmond debater Bob
Franks, tied for first-place speaker.
The Reynolds-Murov team also took
the second-place team award by
winning five of six debates.

Bill Radigan of Arlington, Va.
and Charles Smith of Louisville,
Ky., the second W&L team present,
won four of six debates and finished
fifth. Fourteen teams representing
eight colleges participated.

The Madison College tournament

Why do we believe a free-enter-
prise capitalistic democracy is best
for a small under-developed Asian
country? What right do we have to
impose it? Even if our assumption
is good-willed, why can we believe
the present ruthless military govern-
ment of Saigon will provide for the
poor majority, especially after the
mockery of that glorious election?

Meantime, we Gentlemen scho-
lars accept our H-S deferments
along with the entire system of “in-
voluntary” conscription with a very
narrow possibility of objection. Most
of us have never voted, just as the
nineteen year olds who will be
taken next year.

Dull-eyed, we have our coffee and
15-cent hot buttered English muffins
over the Post with a picture staring
up at us of a light grey-globbed
crumpled mass that once was a real
little boy in Son My.

John Birch advocates attend
Society’s eleventh anniversary

By Bill Melthany

On Friday evening, December
Sth, Jack Whipple and Bill Mell-
hany, both members of the fresh-
man class and the John Birch Soc-
iety, attended the Society's tith
Anniversary Dinner at the New
York Hilton. About 900 members
attended the dinner which is held
yearly to commemorate the found-
ing of the Society on December 9,
1958 in Indianapolis, Bill was the
guest of Jack's parents, Mr. & Mrs.
George Whipple, without whose

ches. Aven Sharp and Jay Marks
scored second place finishes in the
200 yard individual medley and the
diving to leave the score at 36-15.
The first event after the diving was
the 200 yard butterfly where the
Blue team again went 1-2 with Bert
Meem capturing the second behind
Clark's record performance

Mike Kirshbaum and Tom Mur-
ray scored seconds in the 100 yard
freestyle and the 200 yard back

been the wonderful occasion that it
was.

After the conclusion of the cock-
tail hour and dinner the program
consisted of short speeches by sev-
eral members of the Council of the
John Birch Society, the Society's
founder and leader Robert Welch
and such notable guests and mem-
bers as the distinguished Negro
journalist, George S. Schuyler.

After the speeches Jack and Bill
attended a reception in the suite of
one of the Society's National Di-
rectors of Public Relations where
they were able to meet and talk
with many of the Society's writers,
administrators and field staff. Of
particular interest were their con-
versations with Mr. Herman Dins
more, former long-time international
editor of the New York Times,
whose new book, “All the News
That Fits.” is a very knowledgeable
and very critical study of the manner
in which that newspaper reports the
news (the book is in the WAL Jour
nalism Library), and Mr. Lee R
Hayes, Chief Radioman of the
U.S.S. Pueblo and now a member
of and nationwide speaker for the
John Birch Society, who had many
frightening things to say about the
11 months of torture be endured at
the hands of his North Korean
captors. He said he joined the John
Birch Society because those 11
months made him into a confirmed
anti-Communist

The Washington and Lee

Journalism Press Laboratory

noheiohehehoheteteotete

marked the end of debate activity
at Washington and Lee for the first
semester. The second half of the
season for W&L will begin after the
Jan. 30-31 Fancy Dress weekend.
This semester, Washington and
Lee’s debaters have been at 13
tournaments, debating every week-
end since the first of October, and
have won I1 trophies, including five
first-place ones. This is the largest
number the University’s debaters
have accumulated for so early in
the debate season, Chaflin noted.

Road guide aids
knowledge

of girls’ schools

Written primarily for single col-
lege men who sometimes travel for
dates to campuses that may be un-
familiar to them, “The Roadtripper”
is a 192-page paperback guide to 59
eastern women’s colleges from
Maine to Virginia. The book con-
tains information about restaurants,
entertainment and accommodations,
and gives the curfews, dormitory
telephone numbers and viisting hours
for each college. It also describes
from the young male viewpoint the
types of girls to be found at each
of the 59 schools and relates the
quality of campus life.

“The Roadtripper,” The Arcana
Guide to Eastern Women’s Colleges,
was published recently by a group of
Williams College students incorp-
orated under the name Arcana (the
feminine form of the Latin adjec-
tive for “secret”) in conjunction with
Young Market Instrumentation of
Boston,

The Arcanites — Tom Crowley,
Jules Vinnedge, Eric Kelly, Scott
MarArthur and Halley Moriyama—
organized the research methods,
hired a staff of student researchers
and writers, found a publisher and
organized the student marketing set-
up. They designed their own promo-
tional scheme as well, which includes
“Roadtrippers” posters and buttons

Every aspect of the project in-
volved difficulties, especially for
four young men enrolled in school
and active in college life. Finding
a suitable publisher was especially
taxing, because most established
firms were unwilling to go out on a
limb for a student venture. Youth
Market Instrumentation saw the po-
tential value of the Wililams  stu-
dents’ project and was willing to
join Arcana in the risk. Much of the
enjoyment for the Arcanites came
from the entrepreneurial challenge
of pulling off the project.

The guide should be of especial
interest to WAL students on longe:
roadtrips in unfamiliar territory, i.e
Radford, Sullins, Stratford, ete

“The Roadtripper” will sell for

2 in the Bookstore, or it may be
ordered from Arcana, P.O. Box 411.
Williamstown, Massachusetts.

Foreign studies
survey deadline

extended for all

Due to inconclusive resulis the
foreign Study Committee has decid
ed to extend the time in which
freshmen and sophomores can com-
plete the Committee's questionnaire
on the possibility of a foreign study
program at WAL.

According to Professor David
Dickens, of the German department
and chairman of the Committee.
students who do wish to complete
the questionnaires may pick up ex
ira copies from either Mr. Dickens
in duPont Hall or from Dr. Sidney
Williams in Robinson Hall

Dickens did state that the ques
honnaire survey had so far revealed
a surprising student interest in travel
im the British Isles

Dickens also added that this For
eign Study program if
would be open to all WAI
with the proper
non, Nol just

THE RING-TUM PHI Page 3
Blue splits pair this week AN R/C THEATRE

A thirty point win was added to
W&L’'s roundball record in friendly
Doremus. The home crowd was not
disappointed as the Hampden-Sydney
Tigers were out run and out re-
bounded by the score of 86-56
Highlights in the saw long
court length  assisis WE&L’s
big men.

Taking the tip Washington and
Lee University raced ahead with a
lead it would not relinquish. Mike
Neer controlled the opening toss-up
and much improved Mike Daniel
ended up with an unchallenged lay-
up.

light defense faced the Tigers at
the other end of the gym. Unable
tO penetrate the lane or get in
position for rebounding, Hampden-
Sydney tried to shoot W&L out of
the gym, but did not quite make it.
Ihe Tigers were largely limited to a

melee
from

single shot every time they jour-
neyed down the court.
Utilization of backcourt corps

kept the Generals moving the ball
and kept the score climbing. Oc-
casionally the opponents would hit
a couple of buckets in a row to
bring things a little tighter, but after
the second half, the game was out of
reach.

Defense and rebounding were
Washington and Lee’s most impor-
tant plus factors, The back line from
Farmville had a Herculean task ver-
sus the scrappy veterans Neer, Dan-
iel, and Cartwright. This scrappi-
ness led to rebounds and these re-
bounds led to a rout. Once again
the three Blue men underneath the
boards won the game.

Defensively Mel Cartwright play-
ed his best game of the year, and set
a school record with 9 assists. He
also had 22 rebounds, the majority
of which were defensive. All and
all “Magic” Mel played his predict-
able outstanding offensive game with
25 points, but his defense was amaz-
ing.

Against Lehigh things did not go
as well, at least things did not go so
well as far as the Generals were
concerned. Each team had the same
number of field goals but the score
was in the favor of Lehigh 85-71.
Floor mistakes combined with vio-
lations cost the game. The offense
just did not get into gear until it was
too late. Bob Fortune, Lehigh’s big
man, dominated the boards. Wash-
ington and Lee met a good team
with a good defense on a bad, bad
night.

Tarheels edee out WGL matmen

This year, as in the past, Wash-
ington and Lee’s wrestling team is
facing tough competition from many
major colleges. So far the team has

faced UVa, VMI, UNC, Guilford,
and VCU,
The latest matchups were last

weekend when W&L faced the Caro-
lina duo of UNC and Guilford. The
lack of depth and experience made

itself felt as the Generals lost both
matches. On Friday night, Buford
pinned his man, Gow! won by for-

feit, Rasberry won by decision, and
W&L paced UNC by the score of
13-0.

However, the only other W&l
wrestler to win was tri-captain Dave
Higgins, and the Generals went
down by the score, 25-16.

Saturday night left the Generals
on the short end of a 24-14 score.

For this reason, hopes are running
high for W&L’s chances throughout
the season and, most important, for
her hopes in the CAC tournament.
But the lack of depth and an 0-5
record makes the going tough for
the W&L squad. But to quote Dave
Higgins, “Coach Miller recognizes
team problems and I respect very
much the way in which he is hand-
ling them.” We can all help Coach
Miller and the team by turning out
for their January 12 match against
Hampden-Sydney.
