“Harry Byrd ought to be chal-
lenged and defeated.” At least that
is what Dr. Milton S. Colvin, profes-
sor of political science, believes. Dr.
Colvin announced Saturday that he
is “seriously considering” running
against Sen. Byrd (D-Va.).

Dr. Colvin said he thought a
moderate should oppose Byrd and
went on to describe himself as an
“articulate, hard-driving common-
sense moderate.”

Openly admitting his status as an
unknown in the Virginia political
arena, Dr. Colvin does not consider
this a liability. He rather feels this
to be to his advantage, since he be-
lieves the people are “increasingly
looking for the citizen advocate
rather than the politician.” He also
added that he has not gained politi-
cal enemies as the result of “bruis-
ing campaign battles.”

Dr. Colvin declared his purpose
in announcing this possible challenge
to Byrd as a test of public sentiment
on his candidacy.

He said he disagreed with Byrd
“down the line” on fundamental
issues.

Dr. Colvin is unsure about which
party he will align with. To a large
degree this will depend upon what
course Senator Byrd decides to
pursue. Dr. Colvin sees three al-
ternatives open to the incumbent.
Either Byrd can run in the Demo-

Executive Committee passes resolutions
on class officers and student exchan ge

The passage of two unanimous
resolutions highlighted last night's
Executive Committee meeting. There
were no absentees at the session
which passed proposals concerning
reforms in the duties of class officers
and the cooperative student ex-
change program.

Freshman Alan Prater announced
that he and freshman class officers
Rick Gray and Jeff Burris had been
discussing reforms in the responsi-

bilities for class officers. He pro-
posed:
WHEREAS, the present powers

and duties of class officers are
not clearly defined; and

WHEREAS, it is difficult for class
officers to effectively serve their
class without clearly defined

BE If RESOLVED THAT a
committee be formed composed
of the presidents from each class
and two Executive Committee
members to investigate and sub-
mit a report no later than the
first meeting in February on how
the powers and duties of class
officers can be expanded.

The proposal passed unanimously

and Joe Tompkins and Kevin Baker

were appointed to the committee de-

fined in the proposal.

The second resolution was the
result of a request by Dean John
for sentiment on a cooperative ex-
change student program among
seven Virginia colleges and one
North Carolina school. The request

December faculty meeting. New Science 405

prompted vigorous debate which re-
sulted in several proposed reslutions
and amendments.

The EC finally endorsed the pro-
gram with stipulations centering pri-
marily around the application of the
Honor System to exchange students.
The EC requested that exchange
students be tried under the Honor
System of the host school with the
usual penalties of the host school
being imposed.

The EC was also concerned lest
WAL be unable to withdraw from
the agreement after the first year.
The experimental nature of the pro-
gram was cited as being reason for
WAL to insist upon such an “escape
clause” should the experiment prove
to be worthless or harmful to WAL.

A third amendment to the original
endorsement called for the expan-
sion of the program to include a
wider diversity of students and
schools,

Finally the EC allowed for the
institution of an EC seat for the
exchange students. The seat would
be a non-voting one but the repre-
sentative would be able to discuss
general business and to attend the
honor trials of exchange students.

Commons taking

poll of student
culinary desires

In the name of better living
through eating, a Food Preference
Survey is being held at the Com-
mons this Wednesday. The purpose
of the survey is to discover the
edibles which have the strongest ap
peal to the WAL gentleman

The survey will be conducted
through the use of a questionnaire
devised by the Slater School and
College Services. The information
obtained from the questionnaire wil!
in turn, be used as a efilerion in
designing future menus for the din
ing hall, lt is hoped that the resulis
of the survey will provide students
with the best in food service

The questionnaire is organized
such that the student is asked to
pass judgment on a comprehensive
range of comestibles, which contains
something for everybody. For the

All-American boy type of cater
the list includes roast beef, french
fries, and hotcakes. For the gour

be for the senator to withdraw his
name from consideration.

Depending upon which alternative
Byrd chooses, Dr, Colvin will make
his decsion.

Dr. Colvin emphasizes his mod-
erate stand, which more than any-

thing, he thinks, will make him
attractive to either party.
Dr. Colvin told The Tuesday

Ring-tum Phi that his final decision
on whether or not to run will be
forthcoming in about a month. This

Central Lost and
Found in Center

If you are a student who easily
loses articles and doesnt know
where to find them, there is now a
central lost and found. Freshman
class president, Rick Gray, has made
arrangements with Ken Lane to set
up a central lost and found in the
Student Union.

Students have complained that lost
items are not being turned in. The
cause of this may be due to the
students’ unawareness of where these
items can be returned. In the past
they have been kept in various loca-
tions from the library to the Regis-
trar’s office.

But now all lost and found items
can be reported to the front office
of the Student Union from 9:00 to
5:00 or by calling Ext. 299 of the
University. Ken Lane has also
agreed to keep a bulletin up to
date in the front lobby for con-
venience.

PRE-LAW STUDENTS

If you are concerned about how
your score on the LSAT and your
grade point ratio compare with those
of first year students in the nation’s
law schools, you may want to take
advantage of the LAW SCHOOL
PLACEMENT SERVICE. This in-
dependent counselling firm will com-
pare your LSAT score and GPR
with profiles of entering classes at
most of the 130 schools in our
country. They will also provide you
with a list of schools which fall
within the geographical and financial
boundaries which you specify, and
will indicate which schools accept
beginning students for the spring
semester and have evening divisions.

Information and applications
forms are available in the Place-
ment Office, Washington Hall 235,
The one drawback in the service is
that the firm fee for processing this
information is $20.00.

This service will prove to be ex-
tremely valuable in determining the
chances of a student to be admitted
to certain schools and the type of
law school that a student should
consider.

Sounding off ...

is due to the University’s necessity
of knowing whether or not to find
a second semester replacement for
Dr. Colvin should he decide to run,
which would require a leave of
absence.

The decision will be made after
the degree of statewide support for
his candidacy is analyzed. Another
difficulty which Dr. Colvin foresees
is the expense, “It will cost $250,000
to run for the Senate. Some people
say $100,000 more, but I think I
can manage on $250,000.”

A graduate of Yale University and
the University of Heidelburg in Ger-
many, Dr. Colvin came to W&L in
1961. He previously taught at the
University of Montana, the Uni-
versity of Chicago, and Vanderbilt.

In 1960 he made his only bid for
public office, which was unsuccess-
ful, from Montana's First Congres-
sional District. In 1964 he taught
in the Free School Association in
Virginia’s Prince Edward County,
This school was established for the

Negro children in the county when
the public schools were closed to
protest a Supreme Court integration
decision.

Dr. Colvin advocates total with-
drawal from South Vietnam and sup-
ports President Nixon’s withdrawal
plans with the exception of the
proposal to leave some logistical
troops in that area for several years.
He has also called for a “tough-
minded” program to curb inflation.

He feels the most important na-
tional issue is the halting of the
armaments race with a corresponding
curtailment of the defense budget.
He believes the funds now ap-
propriated to defense could be bet-
ter allocated in combatting urban
plight and pollution, in improving
educational opportunities and in pro-
viding job opportunities for the un-
skilled.

Dr. Colvin is married to the
former Countess Maria von Kiel-
mansegg of Austria and has five
children.

Law School honors

retired Va.

Washington and Lee University’s
School of Law Saturday night
honored two retired justices of the
Supreme Court of Appeals of Vir-
ginia for their “eminent contribu-
tions to the advancement of justice
under law.”

Chief Justice John W. Eggleston
of Norfolk and Justice Archibald
C. Buchanan of Tazewell, both of
whom retired last September, were
cited for their distinguished service
to Virginia at a dinner in Evans
Hall attended by approximately 100
federal, state and local judges, other

 

justices

members of the legal profession,
law educators and W&L law faculty
and student representatives.

In the accolades, which were pre-
sented to the two men by law pro-
fessor and retired Dean of the W&L
Law School, Charles P. Light, Jr.,
it was noted that both men are
“loyal alumni” of Washington and
Lee.

Chief Justice Eggleston received
four degrees from Washington and
Lee—the B.A. in 1906, the M.A.

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper
Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Tuesday, November 18, 1969

Paperbacks please

We appreciate fine woodwork as much as anyone else
but. . . libraries are generally designed with other purposes
intended than serving as showcases for exquisite carpentry.
Should the Student Center library continue to be just that?

Several weeks ago we published a notice asking students
to donate paperbacks to the library. As of today, the response
has been something less than commendable.

The library was planned and furnished to provide a com-
fortable atmosphere conducive to relaxed study. It cannot
meet these great expectations with barren austere walls of
wasted space.

 

Take a bigger step

For a University of our size and assumed calibre, we
are noticeably deficient in enabling our students to travel
elsewhere to study. This is a deprivation to our students and
to the school as a whole. For if a large number of students
were provided the opportunity to live on other campuses for
a year or a term, the benefits accrued would pertain not
merely to those immediately involved, but also to the entire
home academic community.

This should seem easy enough to understand, consider-
ing experience is the best teacher. Students who would be
exposed to an alternative culture for an extended period of
time, could more fully comprehend our own little world in
Lexington. That is, they would be in a more knowledgeable
position to assess our shortcomings through comparisons, and
to introduce through analytical syntheses fresh proposals to
correct and invigorate our stagnancies. Of course, the validity
of this assumption hinges on the participation of a significant
number of students. Currently, there are less than five stu-
dents studying off-campus.

The administration evidently realized our needs in this
regard last spring and set in motion the cumbersome ma-
chinery necessary to produce any constructive action. Two
weeks ago a memorandum was issued to the faculty explain-
ing essential background information of a proposed eight
college (seven in Virginia) exchange program. This pro-
gram, considered at a Faculty Discussion Club meeting last
Tuesday and to be further reviewed at the December faculty
meeting, as described in the memorandum is “experimental
in nature, and is subject to review, modification, or termina-
tion.”

This is certainly—and we hope the Board of Trustees
and faculty concur—a great leap forward in this matter.
Should the program receive the green light, W&L will ex-
change not more than thirty students with our neighboring
girls schools. Besides, if for some reason “the experience of
the first year prove all or part of the program’s features
undesirable or infeasible,” the program can be ended.

However, we do not believe that faculty-administration-
trustee interest on exchange should be confined in scope to
Virginia-North Carolina. Rather, it should encompass a much
larger area, particularly including foreign universities.

We have been encouraged in this desire by several facts.
First, the generous sabbaticals awarded to our professors.
Why not adapt the rationale for these to apply to students?
Second, the information session scheduled on Wednesday at
5 p.m. in duPont Auditorium by the University Foreign
Study Committee. This committee has expressed great in-
terest in helping students to gain acceptance in programs
offered by other colleges. But why don’t we have our own
foreign study program? It would be well worth the time
if we address ourselves to this want.

New book questions role
of administration in unrest

A new study of campus unrest
concludes that the real “campus
troublemakers” today are not the
students but the university presidents
and faculties. Laurence J. Kirsh-
baum and Roger Rapoport, co-
authors of the study, write that these
administrators form the basis of a
rigid bureaucracy which completely
disregards students’ constitutional
rights,

Entitled “Is The Library Burn-
ing?”, the study was sponsored by
the Carnegie Commission on the
Future of Higher Education and was
released in both hardcover and Vint-
age editions on November 11. The
authors traveled to over thirty-five
of the nation’s most turbulent uni-
versity and high-school campuses in
an effort to discover the root of
campus disorders.

In a series of journalistic vignettes,
the book shows the chief protagon-
ists of student power during their
unguarded moments off the national
stage. Harvard President Nathan
Pusey is heard confessing from his
office in a freshman dormitory: “I
don’t have time for radical students.
I'm too busy working on faculty
appointments.” San Francisco State
President S. 1. Hayakawa is heard
talking about his battle rations: “I
enjoyed myself immensely during all
the rioting. Whenever there was any

“In the summer of 1967, we have
seen in our cities a chain reaction
of racial violence. If we are heed-
less, none of us shall escape the
consequences.”

“Race prejudice has shaped our
history decisively; it now threatens
to affect our future White
racism is essentially responsible for
the explosive mixture which has
been accumulating in our cities since
the end of World War IL.”

KERNER COMMISSION
REPORT

A seminar on race relations be-
tween Washington and Lee and
Sweet Briar? You've got to be
kidding.

Two schools, approaching lily-
white, located in rural Virginia, have
set up a student seminar in Race
Relations to meet monthly at alter-
nate schools.

The Political Science Club and
International Relations Association
of W&L last year began looking
for a relevant modern issue on
which to base a co-educational

seminar with a neighboring college.
The first reaction came from Sweet
Briar’s Council for the Understand-
ing of Racial Attitudes—of course,
Sweet Briar pushed for Race Re-
lations as their issue.

But how should the topic be
approached?

“The causes of recent racial dis-
orders are embedded in a tangle of
issues and  circumstances—social,
economic, political, and psycholo-
gical—which arise out of the historic
pattern of Negro-white relations in
in America.”

KERNER COMMISSION
REPORT

In the first meeting of the seminar
last month, the group decided that
an interdisciplinary approach to the
problem would be attempted through
a study of black literature on all
subjects, from all angles.

Seminars on political and emo-
tional issues have a tendency to get
bogged down in ideology, PSCIRA,
aS a non-partisan group, suggested
that the topic of Race be approach-
ed without an ideological goal, but

Hilliard harangues Spiro

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD
Columnist

Spiro T. Agnew isn't even funny
anymore. He's pathetic, sickening,
and dangerous! He tells the truth.

When Spiro made his notorious
remarks during the campaign about
“that fat Jap” and “if you've seen
one slum, you've seen them all,”
people just laughed. The guy was
obviously just a stupid politician,
and who could really get mad at
him for that?

During his first nine months as
Vice-President. Spiro managed to
keep his big foot out of his even
bigger mouth, mainly because he
judiciously kept his mouth shut, But
apparently desiring to become a
household word, Spiro has started
talking again—and it's ne laughing
matter,

Spiro began his current crusade
to wipe out the evils of American
liberalism with his attack on the
October 1§ Moratorium on the Viet-
nam War, At a fund-raising dinner
in New Orleans. Agnew condemned
the Moratorium as a senseless
demonstration by youths blinded by
“a spirit of national masochism (and)
encouraged by an effete corps of
impudent snobs” who call themselves
intellectuals

The next target of the venemous
V.P. was Sen. Edmund Muskie.
Spiro charged Muskie with playing
“Russian roulette with U. S. secur-
ity” because the senator had pro
posed a six-month unilateral halt in
multipe warhead (MIRV) tesis. With
the U.S.-Seviet disarmament talks
beginning in Helsinki, Muskie felt
that chances for progress would be
improved if the MIRV tests were
delayed. But apparently still smart-
ing from the comparisons made be
tween the two vice presidential
candidates lasi year, Spiro chose to
question Muskie’s patriotism

Fhe wrath of Spiro’s most recent
tirade has been cast upon television

news. The reason for his outburst
was that the networks chose to ana-
lyze President Nixon's Vietnam
Speech. The gist of Spiro’s remarks
was that television networks should
not comment on presidential policy
—tnless of course they comment
favorably.

This is preposterous. As a public
service, television has the duty to
more than just present the news.
Interpretation and analysis is neces-
sary if the news is to be put in a
context that will give it meaning.
Does the Vice President wish to sup-
press freedom of the press?

Spiro’s entire speech on the sub-
ject was full of half truths and
sweeping generalizations so wide
that they made absolutely no sense.
He claimed that television created
Siokely Carmichael and George
Lincoln Rockwell by giving them
air time. Apparently the Vice Presi-
dent does not realize that the Fed-
eral Communications Commission
Fairness Doctrine dictates that tele-
vision must give air time to all
political philosophies (even if it
means giving free time for vice
presidential hysteria).

Spiro accused the networks of
creating news by playing up the
negative. Should television simply
ignore a riot? Doesn't television
have a duly to present all news-
worthy happenings?

ABC was castigated by the vice-
president for alowing Averill Harri-
man to comment on Nixon's speech
Who, may I ask the Vice President,
is better qualified to make a com-
ment than the man who spent eight
months at the Paris negotiations?

Spire is slowly crealing a poison
ous air of MeCarihyism inthe
United States, Several Senators, in-
cluding J. W. Fulbright, have re
ported an increase in hate mail from
“patriotic Americans” accusing them
of being communists

What comes next Mr
dent? The witch hunts?

Vice Presi-

rather with an educational one, By
setting aside a goal of action for or
against the black, the seminar will
attempt to understand some of the
forces militating towards change in
America’s racial attitudes.

One of the writers is Black
Panther Eldridge Cleaver. An out-
cast, in self-imposed exile in Soviet
Russia, a man who could not find
his place in the freest society in
the world, wrote in Soul on Ice:

“If it is bothersome to you, it
is quite a task for me beacuse not
too long ago it was my way of
life to preach, as ardently as |
could, that the white face is a
race of devils, created by their
maker to do evil, and make evil
appear as good: that the white is
the natural, unchangeable enemy of
the black man, who is the original
man, owner, maker, cream of the
planet Earth: that the white race
was soon to be destroyed by Allah,
and that the black man would then
inherit the Earth, which has always,
in fact, been his.”

On Thursday evening, the Race Re-
lations Seminar will meet in the
Library of the University Center to
discuss both Soul on Ice and the
Kerner Commission Report's Iniro-
duction,

The format of the eight o'clock
meeting is informal, regulated dis-
cussion of Cleaver and of our gov-
ernment report on the background
to civil disorders. The meeting is
open to anyone interested in par-
ticipation,

What good can such a non
partisan discussion of the Black and
the Caucasian serve? Maybe Carl
Rowan partially answers the ques
tion in this month's edition of the
Sigma Delia Chi Quill:

“Nothing disiresses me more to-
day than the fact that people, black
and white, have fundamentally lost
the belief that we can build a mutlti-
racial society in which people live
with a mutual admiration and te
spect. You've got blacks opting for
separatism, saying they reiect in-
tegration because the white man's
made it obvious that he never be-
lieved in it an disn’t really going to
accept it, And you've goi whites
believing that there's just no al

trouble | stocked up for lunch in
the office. From then on the biggest
problem was whether to have sar-
dines or pate de fois gras.”

The plight of the students at Berk-
eley, Wisconsin, Chicago, and other
campuses throughout the country, is
depicted as the authors relate the
administrative resistance students en-
countered in response to their pro-
posals for change. Portraying the
moments of pathos and irony in the
campus events, the two young
journalists see the president in a
situation where he needs a scape-
goat, but his options are limited.
He cannot blame the faculty for the
turmoil, since he serves at their
pleasure; he cannot blame the legis-
lators which hold his purse strings;
he will not blame himself. “, . . That
leaves only one scapegoat—the stu-
dents. And whether the students are
right or wrong on any given issue
is irrelevant. They must lose simply
because they are students,” write the
authors,

At the same time the authors are
equally critical of the faculty. “The
modern American professor,” they
observe, “has become an admirer of
students more in the abstract than in
the flesh...The modern professor
spends as little time as possible with
undergraduates . . . He’s a mobile
father, who, while achieving fame
and fortune downtown, bristles at
the suggestion that he should be re-
sponsible for the kids at home.” As
a result, the authors define the “ugly
self-perpetuating cycle” of student
unrest in which faculty members,
once sympathetic to student off-
campus causes, become increasingly
hostile as the demands move into
the classroom,

‘Cowboy’ offers

provocative look

By CY DILLON

Every kid who ever flexed his
muscles in front of a mirror knows
a little about being Joe Buck, Some-
times it almost hurts to watch “Mid-
night Cowboy.”

That's nearly all I can add to
the hundreds of diverse reviews that
have been written about “Cowboy.”
The movie seems to impress critics
deeply—regardless of age, intellect,
or employer. Reactions and concep-
tions vary greatly, but few reviewers
are left unaffected.

“Cowboy” should appeal to you
a8 a moviegoer because so many
different phases of cinematic art are
so well handled. If you enjoy good
acting, adept directing, smooth
photography, skillfully developed
themes, or symbolism that makes
for pleasant conversation with your
English professor, you'll find Joe
and Ratso’s story worth seeing. If
you appreciate all these qualities,
you'll probably talk yourself into
going more than once.

If you've seen “Cowboy,” | prob-
ably can't tell you why you liked
H# or why you didn't enjoy the
movie, and if you haven't seen it
Fd be foolish to predict your re-
action. | can only say that you
haven't seen many films that look at
life the way this one does

“Midnight Cowboy” struck me as
being less depressing and more
complex than general opinion holds
Unless you're afraid to be told that
American men live in constant fear
of being considered homosexuals, of
unless you don't want to have
distinctions between proper and im-
proper people challenged, give
“Cowboy” a try. Ai worst, it can
only make you see yourself lonely

2 NCAA losses

The National Collegiate Athletic
Association play-offs left a little to
be desired as far as Washington and
Lee University was concerned. The
Generals were rained out Friday,
defeated 10-0 on Saturday by Eli-
zabethtown, and then trounced again
on Sunday by St. Lawrence 8-0.

Elizabethtown, a strong Pennsyl-
vania club, went on to take the
championship honors after blanking
the Generals. Headlining a talented

By MIKE BERRY
Assistant Sports Editor

Washington and Lee University’s
football season is over, and despite
what many people will think when
they notice the 4-5 record the Gen-
erals compiled, it was one of the
most successful seasons in quite a
few years,

[To begin with Washington and
Lee had, this past season, one of
the youngest teams in its long his-
tory. The starting lineups included
nine juniors, five sophomores, and
at different points in the season, five
freshmen. When a teain is playing
with this much youth, it steadily
improves itself, The experience these
men obtained this year will aim
W&L toward a more successful
future.

Another notable thing about this
W&L team is its size. The Generals
offensive backfield averaged a mean
173 pounds, the defensive backfield
ran about 174, That’s not too bad
for small college football, yet it still
ran about five to seven pounds less
than most General opponents. The
real difference in sizes rested in the
W&L offensive and defensive lines.

The General offensive line aver-
aged out to 182 pounds per man,
while the defensive line was slightly
higher at 186 pounds per man. To
come to the point, that is small.
As a matter of fact, to pass along
to you from a very reliable source,
this General team is probably one
of, if not the, smallest teams play-
ing a collegiate schedule today. |
think this is a credit to the players
and to the coaches. It is interesting
to note that in a size-oriented sports
world the Generals of W&L are as
successful as they are.

rhe players are spirited and tough
and the coaches prepare them well.

W&L’s season opened on the road
this year against a surprisingly tough
lowson State team. They battled
the Generals right down to the wire
only to be defeated 14-13. Chuck
Kuhn took scoring honors by run-
ning in the two W&L touchdowns
Jack Baizley’s educated foot added
the decisive extra points. It was a
game of surprises and makes the
W&L vs. Towson State match look
promising for the next few years

The following weekend saw Wash-
ington and Lee taking on state rival
Randolph-Macon. Macon proved to
be too much for the Generals as
their elusive halfback, Howie
Stevens, picked his way through the
Generals’ defense and led the Yel-
low Jackets to a 41-16 victory

The conference season opened on
October 4 as the Generals took on
the Centre College Colonels. The
Colonels were up for the game and
managed to eke out a 14-7 victory
The Generals outplayed the Colonels
but were unable to score the needed
touchdown, (The Colonels are now
the CAC champions.)

The following weekend WAI
played perhaps its finest football
game of the season. Down 13-0 at
halftime the Generals came back in

the second half as quarterback
Chuck Kuhn opened up to flanker
Bruce Green. Emotions started to
rise and the Generals pulled off a
21-13 victory over Hampden-Sydney,

Hoping to keep the momentum
rolling, the Generals came into
Openings Weekend against a strong
Tufts University team. The Gen-
erals constantly harassed the Jumbos,
but time ran out as the Generals
threatened to score the winning TD
The result was a heartbreaking 20-
15 loss.

According to predictions, the rest
of the season should have been full
of easy victories for the Generals
But the predictions proved to be
wrong as the Generals traveled to
Bridgewater College. Though we
were heavy favorites, the fight was
tough to pull out a 10-6 victory. The
game was decided by the golden
instep of Jack Baizley, who kicked
a thirty-yard field goal and the

extra point. Thus “the Baiz” ac-
counted for the four points that
beat Bridgewater.

The next weekend the Generals

boarded their chartered plane and
took off for Sewanee. Although once
again heavily favored, the Generals
were ripe for an upset and Sewanee
was ready to pluck them from the
tree. They did. Before Sewanee’s
homecoming crowd, the Generals
dropped another conference match,
37-21. Th Generals had to win the
next two matches to have a winning
season overall, and to break even in
the CAC.

Things started off bright, as the
Generals came into Parents’ Week-
end with high spirits. They played
excellent ball for three quarters. In
the final period the Southwestern
Lynx gained their momentum and
made their bid for the upset. But
that surge fell short, as the Generals
beat the Lynx 24-19. Many people
called this game one of the best
they have ever seen the Generals
play. Dan Pusey complimented the
team on their poise and for “keep-

Dickens clarifies foreign study

This week’s information session
about study and travel abroad spon
sored by the Foreign Study Com-

last Friday’s Ring-tum Phi.

Professor Dickens, Foreign Study
Committee chairman, acknowledges
the error to be his alone. The
Wednesday afternoon gathering will
present information about various
academic programs, summer work
abroad, life with a foreign family,

Mr. Dickens will also describe the

out that a cumulative GPR of 2.5 is
still required for endorsement by the
committee, although the statement
does not appear in this year’s cata-
logue—an error for which he claims
no responsibility.

Generals bow down to Washington in 20-12 Busch Stadium defeat

ing cool” as the action, at times,
got hot and heavy.

Last weekend turned out disap-
pointing. The Generals flew to St.
Louis and Washington University to
play in Busch Stadium before an
estimated crowd of 10,000. But an
injury ridden squad could not hold
up to an inspired Washington U.
Kuhn played with a bad leg, Jack
Baizley replaced him only to have a
blind-side knee shot put him out of
the game as Chuck returned. But
the anticipated crowd of 10,000
turned out to be a measly 2500,
not to mention the poor turf. The
only bright spot for the Generals
was the 101-yard interception return
by sophomore Dave Brooks, and the
excellent locker room facilities of
a pro stadium, Washington U. hand-
ed W&L a 20-12 defeat and a 4-5
season,

Coach Leslie termed this year a
“significant rebuilding year” and has
cited the “loss of key personnel,”
the replacement of whom will de-
cide W&L’s future success. The most

team for Elizabethtown was Dave
Bender, one of the best players
W&L has attempted to contain all
fall. Having been invited to the
championship for four consecutive
years, Elizabethtown was simply a
better team.

Washington and Lee's next op-
ponent turned out to be tough St.
Lawrence from Canton, New York
\ Scottish boy, Matt Dennet, was
truly amazing on offense. The Blue
offense could not get going because
of non-stop pressure on its fullbacks
St. Lawrence was as high as a kite
for the consolation match, and need-
less to say the Generals were out-
manned.

notable losses are the three tri-
captains: McJunkin, Thornton, and
Dean Kumpuris. Gone also are the
quarterbacks Baizley and Kuhn and
free safety John Nolan.

McJunkin and Thornton were
starting tackles and center and an-
chored the offensive line. Kumpuris
led the defensive unit with the most
tackles at an average of 12.8 per
game. Chuck Kuhn led the CAC in
total offense as he passed for 924
yards and ten TD's. Baizley was
second in scoring with sixteen extra
points and two field goals for a
total of 22 points, Nolan was sec-
ond in interceptions with five,

Also graduating are Jay Meri-
wether, Ken Carter (W&L’s punting
specialist who averaged thirty-five
yards a punt), end John Thomas
who was third in pass receptions
with fourteen for 104 yards, and the
team’s leading receiver and ace end,
Steve “the Chief” Mahaffey, who
grabbed thirty-three for 371 yards
and three TD's.

JoJo Martin led the team in rush-
ing with 435 yards in 135 carries

NCAA games

Explanations cannot soothe such
a pair of whippings but perhaps ex-
pectations can. It is undoubtedly a
propos that Washington and Lee
represented the South in this tourna-
ment. Their record was one of the
finest in the area. But the tourna-
ment made it clear that the calibre
of soccer north of Virginia is far
superior to that below the Mason-
Dixon Line.

Expectations for mext year may
help W&L forget last weekend.
Young players made up the squad
which earned a berth in a national
tournament. These boys will want
to go back and will do anything
necessary to go back as an even
better team next fall.

for an average of 3.2 yards per
carry. The team’s leading scorer and
yardage maker in the pass receiving
department was flanker Bruce Green.
Green made twenty-five grabs for
438 yards and 8 TD's. Bruce had
an excellent season and should be
the leading CAC receiver next year.

The all-purpose man on defense
this year was Dave Brooks. Dave
had 180 yards on thirty punt re-
turns, He was second in tackling

with an average of 10.6 per game.
He also led the team in interceptions
with six for 106 yards and two
TD's.

As of November 8, the CAC team
standings placed the Generals fifth
in rushing offense with 144 yards
per game; first in passing at 121
yards an outing; third in total
offense at 265 yards a contest; and,
first in pass defense yielding only
96 yards a game through the air.
