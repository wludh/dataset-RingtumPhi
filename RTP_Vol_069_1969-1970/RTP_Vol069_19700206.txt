| Students Exhibit at Osaka |

A recent art exhibition in Osaka, Japan included the works of three
Washington and Lee students, David R. Katz, Langdon C. Quin, and
William Chris Bauer. The exhibit was sponsored by the Osaka Private
School Art Society, and included works from Hong Kong, Korea,
Indonesia, and Japan. Washington and Lee was the only American
institution of higher education to have its student's works exhibited.

Washington and Lee University’s
Board of Trustees has authorized
the University to undertake im-
mediate construction of a $3,000,000
addition to Doremus Gymnasium
and renovation of the existing 54-
year-old athletic facility.

A base construction low bid of
$2,552,000 submitted by the J. S.
Mathers, Inc., construction com-
pany of Waynesboro, Va., was ac-
cepted from among seven general
contractors whose bids were opened
Jan. 13 by university officials.

Additional equipment and fur-
nishings, architects’ and engineers’
fees, and other related expenses are
expected to raise the total cost of
the project to nearly $3,000,000, uni-
versity officials said.

Action by Washington and Lee’s
trustees, announced recently by the
Board's rector, Dr. Huston St. Clair,
was taken at their regular winter
meeting, held this year in Atlanta
on Jan. 16-17.

Dr. St. Clair described the gym-
nasium project as a vital initial step

forward in Washington and Lee’s
plans now under development to
provide essential growth in physical
facilities and endowment during the
next decade.

“The Trustees and university offic-
ials face many important decisions
in the months ahead before the exact
scope and dimension of this de-
velopment program can be de-
termined, but we are convinced that
the construction of this gymnasium
addition constitutes an encouraging
beginning on such a_ challenging

Gym Construction to Start

program,” Dr. St. Clair said.

“The inadequacy of our indoor
sports facilities at Washington and
Lee has been a matter of concern to
us for many years,” he added. “We
are delighted to be able to move
ahead toward the satisfaction of this
pressing need, thanks to the active
support and encouragement of many
good friends of the university whose
gifts for the gymnasium have been
among the largest ever received by
Washington and Lee for capital im-
provements,”

Dr. St. Clair said first priority
was given to the gymnasium pro-
ject because of its necessity for
proper support of Washington and
Lee's broad intercollegiate, intra-
mural, and physical education pro-
grams, and because commencement
of the gymnasium addition could
take place independently of other
decisions on physical planning now
being formulated.

Construction is expected to begin
at once, with completion projected
for 18 months later.

Among new facilities to be pro-
vided in the addition are a new
basketball arena with an ultimate
capacity of 3,000, a new swimming
pool, handball and squash courts,
team dressing rooms, and general
locker areas and supporting facili-
ties.

The existing basketball and swim-
ming facilities in Doremus will be
retained, and the structure will be
extensively remodeled to provide
improved offices for the athletic de-
partment staff, physical education
classrooms, and related facilities.

Architects for the project are
Clark, Nexsen, and Owens, Inc., of
Lynchburg, Virginia.

W&L School of Law
Redesignates Degree

The degree granted by the Wash-
ington and Lee University School
of Law has been redesignated the
Juris Doctor (JD) degree. Roy Lee
Steinheimer, Jr.. Dean of the WAL
law school, anounced recently.

The W&L law faculty voted to
change the degree’s title to JD in
place of the Bachelor of Laws
(LLB) degree, and the University’s
Board of Trustees has approved the
change, Dean Steinheimer said. The
Student Bar Association of Wash-
ington and Lee has also favored the
concept of the JD degree.

Dean Steinheimer noted that the
change to the JD degree is in
keeping with the trend at many of
the nation’s leading schools of law.

“The degree will be granted re-
troactively to all graduates of the
law school who request that the
degree be given to them,” the dean
said. “Thus, more than 2,000 alumni
will be eligible to receive the JD
degree.”

As far as current WAI
denis afe concerned.

law stu

the first JD

degree will be awarded in early
February to students who complete
graduation requirements after the
first semester of this academic year.

In changing from the LLB to the
JD, Washington and Lee has “made
no change in the basic curriculum
leading to the degree, or in require-
ments for the degree,” Dean Stein-
heimer said.

The philosophy behind the trend
to the JD degree is that completion
of a law degree requires seven years
of study—the four undergraduate
years culminating in a bachelor’s
degree and then three years of law
school,

“It is felt that to
another bachelor’s
three years of study beyond the
undergraduate level is a bit re
dundant.” Dean Steinheimer noted.

In Virginia, the law schools of the
University of Virginia, the Unive:
sity of Richmond, and the College
of William and Mary have also re
cently gone to JD degree designa-
tion.

On Limiting Power

It is infrequent at best that a powerful body limits it-
self without the impetus of a serious threat from an outside
source. The Student Body Executive Committee Monday
demonstrated just that magnanimity, and we don’t feel
our own involvement in the issue invalidates our approval
of their move.

Their vote was to end the EC’s powers of review and
appeal over the Publications Board on matters of policy
while retaining some de jure financial control. It is not re-
markable that such a separation between student govern-
ment and the student press should find sympathy in some
quarters, nor that the Publications Board should advocate it.

As a matter of fact, many properly found it more sur-
prising to discover the extent of the EC’s powers in this area.
But at any rate, the EC might have rationalized from past
experience to justify retaining their power, even though it
has never in anybody’s memory been exercised. We were,
therefore, gratified at their decision to end the inherent
danger and separate the institutions.

The EC’s financial control over publications is in prin-
ciple at least nearly as uncomfortable a situation as their
powers of review. Yet for the present, we can arrive at no
workable alternative, and until the threat manifests itself
more clearly than it ever has, we consider the arrangement
an acceptable one.

The issue, of course, is not settled. It requires a consti-
tutional amendment, on which the student body will vote
during the Big Four elections. But we are confident the
matter will be deemed important enough to warrant the
turnout necessary to pass the amendment and assure
autonomy for the student press.

A New Department

During exams the University announced the division ot
the Department of Fine Arts into a Department of Arts and
a Department of Music and Drama, It simultaneously re-
vealed Prof. Junkin’s retirement as department head, and
the appointment of Prof. Doyon to head the Department of
Arts and of Prof. Robert Stewart so direct the Department
of Music and Drama.

On several counts, this division was long overdue. The
former grouping was arbitrary and unwieldly, and as a result
every aspect of those disciplines included suffered from
neglect. Especially the music and drama portions of the de-
partment (at least until this year) were peripheral and at-
tended usually only by students involved in the Glee Club
or Troub Theatre, respectively.

The department's division offers the possibility to ex-
pand course offerings in these neglected areas and therefore
to bring those sub jects to the attention of a wider portion
of the student body. But that is going to require increases
in personnel which the administration needs to effect im-
mediately if it is going to capitalize on the opportunity it has
afforded itself.

Finally, A Fancy Dress

We hadn’t planned to use this space this year to review
dance weekends, but we do consider this year’s Fancy Dress
worthy of comment.

A lot can be said against the idea of Fancy Dress in
general, but given its existence, we don't think it could have
been much more entertaining, tasteful, or better organized
than Marty Bass and the Dance Board made it. Especially
when viewed in the light or last year's hasco, the weekend's
latest version can be called a crashing success.

Unfortunately we cant draw any cosmu conclusions

from the simple tact that for once Fancy Dress was a well-run

weekend, but we do hope it isn't the last one,

Letters to the Editor

A Word From Dr. Colvin
fo the Editor, the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

Since the Friday Edition was kind
enough to endorse my abortive can
didacy for the Senate seat, I think
it only fair to use their edition to
thank the many students who offer-
ed to help in any campaign I might
wage. An astonishingly large num
ber of students did come to me and
did offer their services and I wish
through this notice to thank them,

Simply, | thought it unfair to take
enthusiastic supporters down a
political road when I knew that the
bridge would be out by April. But
there may come a better day and
enthusiasm will be needed then.

Those who have it, please keep it.

Professor Milton Colvin
Political Science

On Admissions

lo the Editor, the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

There are some points in your
editorial in a December issue en
titled “Admissions Report” which |
wish to discuss,

Unlike you, I hope that you
have, in fact, “established an in
correct context or emphasis” con
cerning the report of the subcom

mittee on admissions. If the report
does recommend what you say it
does, and if it is accepted and
adopted by the Admissions Office,
WAL is going to be in much worse
shape than it is now.

Your statement seems to be rather
self-contradictory; you state that the
average SAT scores of each suc-
cessive freshman class have been
declining, and say that this is bad.
But in the same editorial, you also
state that SAT scores should
be de-emphasized in considering ap-
plicants. This doesn’t jive.

You say that more underprivileg-
ed students should be admitted; this
is good. I myself, along with many
others in my freshman class, as well
as in the other classes, would not be
able to attend W&L without our
financial aid. But now you say you
want to let in underprivileged stu-
dents without judging them on the
same academic basis as every other
WAL student was judged on when
he applied. Is it really worth lower-
ing the academic standards of the
entire university merely for the sake
of admitting more so-called under-
privileged and most likely less in-
tellectually gifted students?

I say, with a firm belief that |
am not alone, that every student
who applies to W&L should be
judged first on his academic ability,

W&L Class Reports

By MONTY COTTIER

Last Tuesday, February 3, the
United States Senate Subcommittee
on Disaster Relief of the Commit-
tee on Public Works heard a report
from the W&L Class on Research
Methods in Politics and Sociology
concerning the flood last August in
the Blue Ridge area and what fre
actions it caused. The report was
presented by Homer Gamble, who
worked along with David Field,
Christopher Habers, George Hamlin,
harles Holt, Thomas Metcalf,
Joseph Raine, and Robert Skinner
under Dr. William Buchanan to pre-
pare the survey.

The report itself deals with
losses due to the flood only briefly,
ind also only insofar as these losses
apply to the 98 persons interviewed
as the sample. Of these 98, the
rreatest loss to any individual was
forty thousand dollars, and the
average loss was around six thous
and dollars. The total loss for the
irea around Buena Vista. where the
survey was made. was in the neigh
borhood of $1.7 million.

Rather than spend a great deal of
me and attention to the statistics
of loss and repayment, however, the
class devoted most of their study to
the reactions ol the people to the
flood and the efforts of relief work
ers afterwards

In this area, they asked the per
sons being interviewed who they
thought ve the greatest amoun

of aid to the flood’s survivors. Of

~

those questioned, mos! in the lower
half of the economic scale said that
the Red Cross was the top source of
repayment, while of those in th
upper half, only about 50% felt this
was true

in the area of reactions to the
flood, many people were cited a

fore, if the aid organization would
set out the specifics of their aid
programs in the same manner, the
report states, such criticisms might
be avoided

The Richmond Times-Dispatch,
covering the hearing, stated that “a
Washington and Lee student pro
vided the subcommittee with its
brightest moments of the two-day
hearing.

“Homer F. Gamble read a report
prepared by him and seven other
W&L students who surveyed por-

which is best indicated in a vast ma-
jority of cases by his SAT scores
and his high school record, and
second to this by his economic back-
ground and the degree of so-called
“heterogeneity” he would add to the
student body. W&L is fortunate that
it has sufficient funds to do this.

Undoubtedly some people will
bark “What about those people
whose SAT scores and high school
records are not true reflections of
their actual ability and potential?”
Well, many of us may well have
been in the same boat when we
applied to colleges for admission as
freshmen. Perhaps this is the rea-
son why we are not all at Harvard,
or Yale, or wherever we may have
wanted to be. But then, as some
blind idealists fail to realize, no
system is perfect, and the Admis-
sions system at W&L is no excep-
tion,

[ agree with your statement in
that I do “encourage a thorough
consideration of the report when it
is complete.” I only hape that the
Admissions Office will seriously
consider the possible consequences
if the proposed policy, as your edi-
torial states it, is in fact adopted.
W&L would certainly follow in the
footsteps of so many other schools
in successfully obtaining “heterogen-
city,” while at the same time lower-

to Senate

tions of the disaster area in Vir-
ginia, stating that among. other
things the survey concluded that the
agencies that provided the most as-
sistance to disaster victims were the
most criticized.”

The Washington Post, on Wednes
day, ran an article in which acting
chairman Spong was quoted as
stating that “the report could serve
as a model for the Red Cross and
other agencies in seeking better ways
to communicate with disaster vic-
tims,”

 

ing its academic standards,

I hope that there is a_ better
alternative.

Let me stress that it is not the
idea of the subcommittee of which
I disapprove; | am all for it, and
intend to work for its goal. It is
only unacceptable if it is truly what
you stated it to be. I think you
have jumped the gun on publicizing
it and presented it in the wrong
way, but all of us at W&L should
be concerned about it, at least
enough to find out what it truly is,

A Farewell to W&L

fo the Editor, the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

Never in my life have I been
happier or more content than here
at Washington and Lee. Entering
in the fall of 1966, I was filled with
the usual fears and anxieties of an
incoming freshman, but these fears
quickly dissipated. Getting to know
people and making friends seemed
to come particularly easy here, and
the loneliness and homesickness that
had been frequenting me disap-
peared.

Perhaps, the only bad side of my
life at W&L was not being here.
In the summer of 1967 there was
this accident, and I was out of
school, flat on my back, for a year
and a half. You can’t believe how
1 looked forward to returning to
WAL last semester, even if I was
the oldest sophomore on campus.

Now, I'm married and just can’t
afford W&L any longer. Therefore,
this semester will be my last as
a member of the student body. This
is the reason for my letter. Not
addressed to any one person of
group of persons, this letter is meant
for the University as a whole, and
its intent is to thank Washington
and Lee for some of the happiest
years of my life.

also turned in fine

defensive per-
formances; Neer held the Tigers’
hot-shooting Dave Trumbower to

only 10 points.

Both teams were fairly cold. The
Generals hit on 38% of their floor
shots, and the Tigers could only
manage an even colder 35%. But
the telling was under the boards, as
Washington and Lee outrebounded
the enemy by a resounding 71-51
margin.

The victory was the Generals fifth
in a row, a string which will be
challenged Saturday by Baltimore
University. The Marylanders feature
the nation’s second-leading small
college scorer in Bunny Wilson, who
owns a 32.6 average.

Following tomorrow night's home
fare will be matches with Lynchburg
and Old Dominion. Lynchburg, hav-
ing a bad year at 3-15 will pro-
vide little opposition, but the Mon-
archs of Norfolk will be tough to
beat. Old Dominion currently owns
the best basketball record of Vir-

ginia colleges with a 14-1 mark.
The Monachs have won thirteen
straight contests and are currently

ranked 15th in the

Editor, The Ring-tum Phi:
Voluntary limitation of its power
by any group, especially a political
one, is not such an ordinary oc-
currence that it can be routinely
reported. | would like to say that
the Executive Committee’s action
Monday night was more than per-
sonaily pleasinge—it was represenia-
tive of a prevalent attitude among
the members that the interests of
the students have to be given priority
over the interests of EC members.
Ihe EC also deserves some sort

of mention for generously allowing
this matter and my presence before
them for untold hours.

What's a career with a social conscience?

Quite simply, one that offers responsibility and chal-
lenge on the one hand. And social involvement and
commitment on the other.

One that can be financially satisfying without sacrifie-
ing emotional values.

One where progress is based on performance and
merit.

In short, the kind of rewarding career that a company
like Prudential offers you,

Our basic business, of course, is to protect the basic
unit of society—the family. But we've extended our
social involvement to helping fight urban decay and
unemployment

By investing in new businesses and new factories.
y 5

By providing funds for low-cost housing. And, in
addition, our people provide the leadership required
to build hospitals, colleges, and libraries.

In short, Prudential is concerned with not just life
itself, but with the quality of life. This is the kind
of company we are. And not by chance, but by choice,

If you're a socially-conscious graduate, we'd like to

have you join us In marketing, management, invest-
ments, applied computer technology, accounting, sales,
or actuarial areas.

when the Prudential representative is scheduled
