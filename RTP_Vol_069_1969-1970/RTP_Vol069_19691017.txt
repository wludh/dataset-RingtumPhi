March, Two Discussions Fizzle

Except for a few discussion groups
that didn’t come off or were acci-
dently locked out and an anti-war
march that failed to materialize, the
activities of the Oct. 1S moratorium
on the Washington and Lee campus
Wednesday were termed “successful”
by a moratorium coordinator.

The six talks in Lee Chapel Wed-
nesday morning were well attended
as approximately 500 people heard
talks from William Mclilhany, a rep-
resentative of the John Birch Soc-
iety: ev. Charles Swezy, associate
pastor of Lexington Presbyterian
church; Col. George Brooke, a his-
tory professor from Virginia Mili-
tary Institute; and three W&L fac-
ulty members,

Mclihany in his talk, “The John
Birch Society's Position on Viet
Nam,” proposed that this country’s
troubles in the war were caused by
a conspiracy between the govern-
ments of the United States and the

Several Virginia Schools
Observe Moratorium Day

Students throughout Virginia
marked Wednesday's Vietnam Mora
torium, the largest such protest in
the nation’s history, in a variety of

ways.

At the University of Virginia,
more than one thousand people
gathered near Thomas Jefferson's

statue to hear a series of speeches
conducted from the Rotunda, the
Richmond Times-Dispatch reported
Karl Hess, a former aide to Senator
Barry Goldwater who has become
a leader in the anti-war movement,
told the crowd that they were in
fact “rehearsing a general strike.”
Ihe paper that folk-sing
ing and a series of signs displaying
various points of political persuasion
were also part of the activities, to
gether with a seeming disregard for
the University’s long-standing dress

added

The Times-Dispatch added that
moratorium spokesmen reported a
60 per cent cutting average, but au-
thorities felt this figure to be highly
exaggerated,

More than one-third of Hollins’
faculty cancelled classes, leaving
moratorium observance to the indi-
vidual student, according to the
Roanoke Times. Over 500 chose to
attend discussion groups and some
heard Dr. James Crooks of the his
tory department term the Hollins
faculty “wishy-washy” on the mora-
torium

Another mock funeral was con-
ducted at Virginia Tech, where, ac-
cording to the Times-Dispatch, 225
students participated in the placing
of dead leaves on a symbolic casket.
Lists of war dead were also read.

About 600 students appeared at
an afternoon teach-in on the Blacks-
burg campus. Campus police were
on guard to maintain flags at full-
mast,

Roanoke College was the scene of
a discussion forum Wednesday
morning. The Times reported that
Pham Chac Rau former South Viet-
namese ambassador to the United
States. told the audience that his
people are “fed up” with the war,
but predicted a “bloodbath” if the
country falls under Communist rule

Later, Roanoke students joined
others from Hollins in a night serv-
ice in Roanoke’s Elmwood Park
Amphitheater

The Times-Dispatch also noted
that students at Petersburg's Rich-
urd Bland College had boycotted a
proposed “free period” moratorium
observance, though some attended
Virginia State. Some
students circulated a petition signi
lying “unqualified support” for the

U.S.S.R. He asserted that the “con-
stant flow of aid and comfort to our
enemies must be stopped at once.”

Rev. Swezy asked the question
“Is South Vietnam a_ legitimate
political entity?” in his talk, “Con-
flict in Viet Nam: What are the
Issues?”. Sweezy then continued his
pursuit of the issue by asking if
South Vietnam isn't a_ legitimate
political entity—which he said it
isn't according to the Geneva ac-
cords—is our war there waged un-
der legitimate authority?

Col. Brooke asserted that “We're
playing right into their (the enemy's)
hands” by holding anti-war demon-
strations in his speech on “American
Obligations in Asia.” He discussed
“what might almost be called hys-
teria gripping the country on Viet
Nam.”

Prof. Milton Colvin of the politi-
cal science department in his speech
on “Viet Nam in the Long Perspec-
tive” said, “I do not object to the
war as such, but I do feel we should
get out of it.” He added that he
did not think this withdrawal
should be unilateral.

James Loesel, also of the political
science department, supported U.S.
disengagement from Vietnam im-
mediately in his speech “Unilateral
Withdrawal Now”,

Dr. H. J, Pemberton of the phil-
osophy department gave his thoughts
on “Temptations of the War’.’ He
expressed a fear that no side would
do “the good thing.”

The five discussion groups that
met Wednesday afternoon drew au-
diences totalling about 70 people,
including several girls from South
ern Seminary Junior College and a
group from Roanoke.

The discussion group that couldn't
get into its selected room was the
veterans of Vietnam group.

Stuart to Give

Prof. Dabney Stuart of the WAI
English department will read from
his poetry Wednesday at 7:30 p.m
in the WAL Bookstore.

The gathering will be an informal
one, according to Mrs, Betty Mun
ger. proprietress of the Bookstore.

Stuart joined the WAL faculty in
1965 after having taught at William
and Mary. A graduate of Davidson,
he attended Harvard graduate school

His works won him the Dylan Tho

An oversight on the part of mora-
torium coordinators appeared to be
the reason the group found itself
locked out of its room, Payne 1A,
according to one of the group's fac-
ulty leaders and university officials.

According to W&L superintendent
of janitors James Kirkland, no one
had told the school janitors before
the groups’ meeting time to unlock
the doors to the classrooms that
were to be used.

Kirkland also stated that it is
school policy to lock all the doors
in Payne Hall that can be locked
after classes as well as all the doors
to all other classrooms in the school.
He said the only reason the other
discussion groups found the doors
open was because he read on the
moratorium schedule posters that the
rooms were to be used Wednesday
afternoon. He had missed the sche-
duling of the Payne hall group in a

Henberg Cited

As Nominee

Swede Henberg, president of the
student body, has been unanimously
approved by the faculty as a candi-
date for a Rhodes scholarship.

The faculty took the move at its
meeting last week. James G. Ley-
burn, professor of sociology and
Rhodes scholarship liaison, announc-
ed the decision yesterday.

Henberg, the fourth-ranking scho-
lar in the senior class, will compete
for the scholarship with other stu-
dents from his home state of Wyom-
ng and other western states. In De
cember 32 candidates from all over
the country will be chosen from
more than a hundred applicants.

added.

Moratorium leader prof. Paul
Beebee agreed that apparently stu-
dent moratorium coordinators fail
ure to notify the janitors was the
problem.

The discussion group that failed
to come off was Rev. Swezy’s.
Swezy reported that no students
showed up at Washington Annex
where the discussion was to be held
He said he waited for a short time
and then went home.

Other discussion groups were
more successful. Loesel attracted be
tween IS and 20 people to his open
seminar in Newcomb Hail. Colvin
had 16 attending his seminar, also
in Newcomb, shortly after its 2 p.m
starting time. John Birch spokes-
man Bill Mcilhany drew a crowd of
approximately 40 people to his films
and discussions in Dupont audi-
torium.

About 15 people showed up on
the Commons lawn later Wednesday
afternoon to begin the scheduled
anti-war march. They waited around
for almost an hour for more people
to come and then called off the
event.

It was learned that several mem

campus opposed the march and that

Some Last Words

We have a few more things to say about the Oct. 15
moratorium before the matter ceases to be a concern for
journalists and becomes the sole property of historians in
search of significant moments in the life of this institution.

When the issue was first brought to the attention of the
student body via a New York Times ad, our initial editorial
response was to advocate participation in peaceful demonstra-
tions against the war by all who opposed it, in order for there
to be some way to judge the extent of student discontent with
the present policy in Vietnam.

At that time the idea of a non-partisan approach had not
been formulated, but had we known about it in time our
reaction would have been similar to that of many students
here. We probably would have questioned its propriety for
that date, since it was planned as a nationwide day of protest.
And that being the case, we would likely have despaired that
anything like a non-partisan stance could be maintained. The
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi explicitly raised this objection, con-
cluding that partisan efforts had destroyed the possibiilty for
clear-headed reflection on the matter.

While it is true that the organizers of the non-partisan
“Day of Concern” program had formidable obstacles to
overcome, we judge, with a hindsight of which the Tuesday
edition didn’t have the luxury, that the effort was successful.

Dealing first with the matter of propriety, it is, we feel,
entirely appropriate for students at any time to make indivi-
dual re-evaluation of the war, and we find it especially needful
on a day which apparently was used elsewhere for students
vehemently against the war merely to reinforce each other in
their beliefs. An objective examination would have been a
fruitful addition to any observance of the moratorium.

The problem, and the desirability, of remaining entirely
non-partisan, as Tuesday advocates, is another matter. Prof.
Pemberton noted that much of the opposition to the war was,
symptomatic of our society, couched in the same terms and
employing the same techniques as support of the war. It is
after all as paranoid to find a CIA agent behind every column
as it is to find a communist behind every beard. Many stu-
dents reognized this and sought to depart from the militant
and reductive rhetoric of both sides, and the degree to which
they were successful is measured by the remarkable lack of
violence during these observances.

Yet W&L went one step further in moving away from
the dogmatic mentality that characterizes the dual monologues
(we can’t call them a dialogue) both wings have presented in
the past. The morning session offered every conceivable view
in the most objective manner possible. At that time the neces-
sary individual re-examination was called for, and we have
reason to believe it was effected in many.

It is, of course, true that the effort did not remain strictly
non-partisan throughout the day, but we don’t feel that fact
debases the value of the initial presentation, nor do we think
students here were obliged to remain neutral (that implying
inaction for the Tuesday edition).

In the largest sense even the morning session wasn’t non-
partisan, at least in the way the Tuesday edition construes the
word, i.e., as suspending prediletions and prior value judg-
ments in a completely objective re-examination of the war.
Rather, it was multi-partisan, presenting men who presum-
ably had already subjected themselves to the type of indivi-
dual re-evaluation the program should have elicited from the
rest of us. These men offered forceful defenses of views to
which they are very much committed.

We aren't pretending, of course, that between 12:30
p.m. and 2 pam. Wednesday everyone had a chance to ex-
amine his own mind thoroughly and commit himself to one
of the sides available thus justifying participation in the parti-
san activities of the afternoon and evening. We are convinced,
however, that many students had reached commitments after
careful thought, and we submit that not only were they within
their rights to act on the basis of their convictions, they were
obliged to do so. They were further obliged to maintain the
dignity and respect for other positions that marked the morn-
ing session. This they did, and so carried on not only the
content of the morning session, which was action based on
commitment, but also its spirit of fairness.

Neither can we concede the Tuesday edition’s point that
such demonstrations are of no avail. Their editorial asserted,
"We all should be well aware that the war in Vietnam is a
national disaster.”” Perhaps, we all should be, but VMI's Col.
Brooke, as well as most of the men who frame our foreign
policy, seem to overlook the self-evidence of the claim. Mere
thought on the matter is not going to reveal that truth to
them. Peace demonstrations or other public statements against
the war, especially insofar as they include “moderates”, can
make the nation’s leaders realize that the number of Amerti-
cans who agree with them is dwindling daily, and so political
pragmatism may accomplish what moral sensibilities have not.

We can then answer the question the Tuesday edition
poses——"Why not be non-partisan?” —-with the observation
that neutrality can only be carried so far. Fichte probably
said it best—"'Not simply knowing, but after your knowledge
to act is your destiny.”

Letters To The Editor . . .

 

 

Parent Looks At Rush

To the Editor of the Friday Ring-
tum Phi:

As a parent I was sorry to hear
the rush system was going to be de-
layed this year and happy when it
was moved back to the first week.

To clarify—I have a son in the
freshman class. I think it is easier
for a boy to concentrate on studies
the first semester if rush is over and
he does not have to worry about
making a good impression on frater-
nities all semester.

In most schools that have deferred
rush they find that by January boys
are selected on a much more deli-
berate basis, i.e, fraternities tend to
be marked. One has all athletes and
selects athletes—one tends towards
party boys—one has the scholars—
and one the boys prominent in acti-
vities. A quick one week rush leads
to more diversity in each fraternity.

If a boy should not adjust im-
mediately to college and his grades
should not have the required frater-
nity average, he may then have to
wait still another semester to pledge
—and spend another semester “on
edge”. Here an older fraternity “big
brother” would have been a big help.

I point out also—Dave Olson
contradicts himself,

Paragraph two: “One of the argu-
ments that fraternities have long
used against deferred rush is that
they would be over burdened finan-
cially.” He explains they would not
have the freshman house bill in-
come,

In the last paragraph he states
“The old system is antiquated, ex-
pensive, and unwieldy.” He has not
proved this to me,

Thank you for our complimentary

A Puppet IFC?

By JAY WETSEL
IFC Secretary

Structurally the IFC is a repre-
sentative body with the expressed
purposes of promoting better inter-
fraternity relations and enforcing
social conduct rules upon the frater-
nities. As such the organization,
which represents the largest number
of students of any on campus, is
expected to be a vigorous and pro-
gressive body, and because it has
not been so it has been the object of
much unfavorable publicity within
the past few weeks. If this concep-
tion of the IFC were true, such cri-
ticism would certainly be justified,
and I would applaud its authors for
bringing the inadequacies of the or-
ganization to the focus of campus
attention.

However, this is not the case:
there is a shadow government be-
hind the IFC which dictates what
the IFC can and will do, This sha-
dow, though most shadows are in-
nocuous, is the faculty, sometimes in
the guise of a faculty meeting, but
more often than not, it is the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee (SAC), curi-
ously composed of FOUR students
and SEVEN faculty. Any subsian-
tive matter, such as deferred rush or
girls upstairs in fraternities, must be
referred to the faculty for approval.

We are usually told when the
faculty is receptive to a given idea,
eg. girls upstairs in fraternity
houses; thus, in reality the IFC
operates within a narrow zone of
tolerance established by the faculty,

and any proposals which originate
in the IFC are either forwarded to
the faculty as being open to discus-
sion and possible passage or it is
dismissed, being contrary to current
faculty concensus. Such an environ-
ment is barren soil for creative ac-
tion on the part of the IFC.

Last year the faculty told us we
had to have a deferred rush plan
ready to be implemented in the fall
of 1969. We worked for seven
months, and submitted our plan,
meeting their every demand, but

Frat Parietals
This Weekend

This Openings Weekend 14 frater-
nities will be able to enjoy the newly
liberalized parietal rules passed by
the Student Affairs Committee sev-
eral weeks ago.

Seven fraternities received full
approval of their applications to
date. These are: Delia Upsilon,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Kappa Alpha,
Phi Delta Theta, Pi Kappa Phi, Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon, and Sigma Phi
Epsilon.

Tentative approval has been given
fo seven others, Chuck Cahn, IFC
president, explained that full pass-
age was not given because there
were one or two small points left
out of each fraternity’s petition that
“need to be incorporated before the
plan is completely acceptable”,

(Continued on Page 4)

they fell to bickering over details;
so we still have the old system.

They generously allowed girls up-
stairs in the dorms, though they were
there last year anyway, but they
can't seem to agree how the frater-
nities could enforce such a plan—
fraternity men being notoriously
wild and reckless as evidenced by
their irresponsible social behavior.

Remember that the IFC is a rule-
enforcing, not rule-making agency
of the fraternity system.

Recently, the IFC Judicial Board
punished a house for a rule infrac-
tion, but our decision, like those of
the Student Control Committee, are
reviewed by the faculty dominated
SAC (after all, students are naturally
biased), and our punishment was re-
placed by a more stringent one. SAC
admonished us to judge more re-
sponsibly next year, but who deter-
mines what is “responsible-?”

The faculty made the rules vis a
vis the shadow government, now
they want to enforce them. If the
faculty makes the rules and now
enforces them, obviously the IFC is
merely a facade created to make the
students think they have something
they don't—a_ responsible, self-gov-
erning fraternity system.

Why have an IFC? Why not let
SAC run the whole show? I, my-
self, dislike being merely a puppet
and policeman.

“Words ought to be wild, for they
are the assualt of thoughts upon the
unthinking.”

An “Eleventh Hour Move”

By DAVE OLSON

Wednesday was indeed an historic
day in America. Thousands of stu-
dents and others joined in a protest
against administration § policy in
South Vietnam. At W&L Oct, 15
was something of a revolutionary
day. For the first time in a very
long while there was a demonstra-
tion of feeling about something,

Lee Chapel was filled Wednesday
with students who came to hear
about the war, They were interested,
concerned and polite. There was no
hooting or booing of speakers who
spoke in favor of the war, They
were greeted with what might be
termed polite applause, for obvious-
ly the majority of students in Lee
Chapel had decided to get up Wed-
nesday morning because they felt
strong misgivings about American
vction in Vietnam, But unlike many
campus demonstrators of today, they
were very peaceful as were the maj-
ority of demonstrators Wednesday
Wednesday may have offered hope
that the reverbial apathy which
pervades this campus is gradually
dying

The array of speakers that came
to the platform Wednesday was a
definitely homogeneous group, On
the political right was Mr. William
Meiihany who offered the John
Birch Society's position on the war
and on the left Prof. James Loesol

who advocated unilateral withdrawal
immediately. The most distinguished
speech of the day was offered by Dr.
Milton Colvin who advocated a
phased withdrawal immediately,
Maybe it was his brevity, but there
is little doubt that Dr. Colvin left
the most lasting and significant im-
Pression of any of the speakers

Of all the speakers the most dis
turbing was Col. George Brooke
who presented what has to be label-
ed as the sterotype “hawk” posi-
fon on the war, The incredulity
with which most of his comments
were received showed the absolute
unacceptability of this pesition to
event what is supposedly a conser-
vative student body.

Above all else what does Wednes
day mean? On the local scene it
shows that WAL students are finally
getting concerned about national
issties instead of remaining ambiva
lent in the face of what has been a
Brave national problem for four
years. In a kind of eleventh hour
move WAL has made known its
basic feeling—dissatisfaction

On the national scene it shows us
that students are turning away from
relatively minor campus problems to
more important national issues
There is no reason why the campus
should be isolated from national
problems, and students are now di
recting their aliention to the most

important of all national issues.
Hopefully, when (and if) the Viet-
nam “tragedy” is a part of the past
this will continue on the campuses
of the nation, that the students will
then turn their attention to Pressing
national issues instead of unimpor-
lant campus questions, In other
words, an end to selfishness and a
turn to worldly concerns.

issues of the Ring-tum Phi. I believe
I have read every word in all the
issues.

“The Great Split’’

To the editor of the Friday Ring-
tum Phi:

The great split was long in com-
ing, but it finally hit; the fission of
unity and identity evaporated, Stu-
dents at W&L are choosing their
swords, forged of emotion, to wield
in a battle of squires; squires who
are told that they are knights. Down-
fall is imminent as students grasp
for the emotionally inspired left and
right,

Actually political differences have
always existed at W&L, but they
have never been “forced” to be com-
pletely alienated before. Our appeas-
ing pedagogues and administrative
hierarchies have decided to try to
identify with youth and _ its pre-
supposed righteousness. By doing
this, change has been imposed, with
little regard to reason or precedent,
to give the student what he wants
(or at least what they think he
wants). What a liberal attitude, an
often suicidal application of reason:
decadence and floundering regres-
sion. The future holds many sur-
prises for W&L, such as chaos, radi-
calization, loss of honor and morals,
and physical intellectualism,

By allowing teachers to deprive
stuednts of a class hour they paid
for, Wednesday was a classic calam-
ity. Despite the fact that October 15
was planned to be a non-partisan
affair, the very fact that it was held
on October 15 was giving it the dis-
tinction of Papa lefty nepotism. It
was mot organized to be construc-
tive, simply because it could have
been held after classes. A true un-
biased approach would have been
an afternoon or night discussion on
a different day. This would have
alienated it from the national move-
ment, and yet would have been very
impressive because of its individual
approach as opposed to other
schools. Instead, the faculty only
listened to the screaming minority
and ran, smiling, to grant all wishes
and to profess its “progressive” at-
titude.

Would they have allowed such a
day if “October 15” had never been
heard of? Hell, no! Now what are
they going to do when the protest
lengthens to two days in November,
three days in December, and so on?
If one day is justified then why not
two or three? And if we really want
to get “relevant” why don’t we just
talk all day about whatever comes
to mind?

Next on the keep-up-with Harvard
scene is the racial issue, Now I've
heard that if I ask how many Neg-
Foes are on campus, they can't tell
me because they don't Specify a
Persons’s race on his record. Good!
I agree with the Policy of accepting
a man on his individual merits and
not on his race, religion, etc. Now
after asking the above question and
Belting the above answer, | would
like to ask why they go out and try
to recruit Negroes? The answer will
of course be paradoxical with the
one above. After all, we can't let
other colleges out do us: we want to
erin and say that W&L contains
~-——% White, —..% Negro, —--%
Indian, and --% Natufians, This
indicates our perfect indescriminat.
ing attitude. Really, what could be
more unbigoted than recruiting stu-
dents according to race, etc?

All hell is going to break loose
on our campus in a few years, but
we can't blame the students. A
great instittuion is dying of a self-
imposed fast, denying itself pride,
honour, order, and 4 remembrance
of what went before.

Some truth there was, but
dash'd and brew'd with lies,
To please the fools, and
puzzle all the wise,”
John Dryden

Generals to Battle Tufts
For Anniversary Game

Washington and Lee will mark
its 96th year of college football
when the Generals take on Tufts

Saturday in a nation-wide celebra-
tion of college football’s centennial,

The Generals made their debut on
the gridiron in 1873, defeating VMI
4-2. Since that time, W&L has pro-
duced many great teams, some mem-
bers of which will be honored at
halftime Saturday in addition to the

crowning of W&L’s Centennial
Queen.
H. K. “Cy” Young, a Hall of

Famer of the 1914 team, backs Sam

Mattox and Joe “Double-O” Arnold
of the 1934 squad, Tim Stark, Ray
Leister and Glitterin’ Gil Cocetti of
the 1950 team and Steve Suttle, cap-
tain of the 1961 squad, will be on
hand,

Also to be honored will be some
of the outstanding teams in W&l
history. The 1914 team was the un-
defeated South Atlantic Division
champs, while the 1934 squad was
the Southern Conference’s top team.
The team of 1950, representing the
champs of the Southern Conference,
was a Gator Bowl participant in

Debbie Coslett, wife of the Gen-
erals’ defensive lineman Ned Cos-
lett will be crowned Centennial
Queen at halftime Saturday.

Tufts, itself an early football par-
ticipant, having started in 1875, is
undefeated in three games, The air
corps of saniro quarterback Pete
Cohen to Rich Giachetti has shat-
tered all the school’s old records.
Indeed, Giachetti has led the East
in receptions for the past two years.
The Jumbo’s passing attack has fell-
ed Drexel, 29-13, Colby, 40-13. and
Norwich, 21-16,

rhe Generals seem to have pieced
together the parts needed to form a
potent offense of their own, follow-
ing last week’s dramatic 21-13 rally
to beat Hampden-Sydney.

The offense, coupled with a deter-
mined defense, has produced a 2-2
record,

JoJo Martin has gained 212 yards
for a 3.9 average to lead W&L

Golf and Tennis Over

In Fall Intramurals

League champions in intramural
tennis have been determined as the
season ended yesterday. Sigma Nu,
the defending intramural champion,
won its league as did the runners-up
from last year, Zeta Beta Tau. The
league champions, all undefeated,
are:

League A Sigma Nu 4-0

League B Phi Delta Theta 4-0

League C Zeta Beta Tau 4-0

League D Phi Kappa Psi 4-0)
The finals, a round robin affair, will
be played next Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday afternoons.

In intramural golf, the picture is
not as clear, as only two league
champions had been determined
afternoon. Sigma Alpha Epsilon is
when play was concluded yesterday
the only team to escape league play
with an unblemished record. Pi
Kappa Alpha won its league and a
three way lie exists in the other two
leagues.

W&L to Meet
State Champs

The soccer team heads into the
last leg of the schedule’s most de-
manding weeks when they battle
state-champion Roanoke College on
Friday. After suffering a close 2-1
loss to Virginia last Friday, the Gen-
erals went on the road to take on
Lynchburg College. The contest
ended in a 3-3 deadlock that saw
neither team being able to capitalize
in two sudden-death overtime per-
iods,

Carl Hyatt opened the scoring for
Washington and Lee when he took a
Don Belt pass and beat the Lynch-
burg goalie, 14:21 into the first
quarter,

Meade Kampfmueller made it 2-0
at 21:43 of the first quarter scor-
ing a neat goal, coming in off his
position at right wing. Lynchburg
came back with a goal halfway
through the second period to make
it 2-1.

Soccer to Meet Roanoke Today

(Continued from Page 3)
Generals had their seemingly safe
two-goal lead back as Don Belt con-
verted a Kampfmueller cross-pass
into W&L’s third goal.

Lynchburg bounced back to score
two second half goals while holding
the Generals scoreless, the game
ending in a 3-3 tie.

“I don't like to be satisfied with
a tie.’ Coach Lyles said after the
game, “but we're still undefeated
on the road and in that sense it was
a victory.” The coach said that the
offense had been sluggish in practice
after the Virginia game, but that
the defense had not let up for a
single moment. “Lynchburg had

Fraternity Parietals

Approved For Weekend
(Continued from Page 2)

“However,” he said, “those which
did receive tentative approval
will be allowed to have girls up-
stairs this weekend.” Beta Theta Pi,
Phi Epsilon Pi, Phi Kappa Psi, Phi
Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa Alpha,
Sigma Chi, and Sigma Nu fall into
this category.

Phi Gamma Delta was the only
fraternity to have its petition fe
jected; Kappa Sigma submitted theit
plan too late to be ruled on. Delta
Tau Delta and Zeta Beta Tau have
not submitted applications to date.
By next week it is expected that all
petitions will have been received
and passed.

Contained in the various parietal
regulations are hours girls are al-
lowed above the first floor, which
for most fraternities are from ap-
proximately 5 p.m. Friday to 3 a.m
Saturday morning, 5 p.m. Saturday
to 3 am. Sunday, and from five
o'clock until midnight Sunday. Each
student should check the times for
his fraternity because these do vary.
At least one resident enforcing
member must be present in the
house during these periods

Gentlemanly conduct must be ob
served at all times and brothers can-
not infringe on the rights of others

In most cases penalties for in
fractions of any of these rules will
result in a fine of the offending per-
son and/or a weeks suspension from
the fraternity. Penalties also vary
from house to house

more shots on goal, especially in the
latter part of the game, but the de-
fense proved equal to the task,”
Lyles observed.

The Roanoke game today will
feature an All-American, Roanoke
College's star left wing Scott An
derson, He has made All-American
Honorable Mention for two years in
a row and is one big reason why
Roanoke was the state champion
last year and is 5-0 this year. It
will be the toughest game of the
year for the Generals, but as Coach
Lyles remarked, “My players will
be ready for them.” It all begins at
3:15 on the W&L field.
