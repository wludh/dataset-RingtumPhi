Faculty, Stude

Students Accept Proposal 4 to 1;

Faculty Modifies

In a_ special faculty meeting
Monday night, a resolution was
passed suspending absence regula-

tions entirely for the remainder of
the spring semester,

The faculty resolution gives stu-
dents the option of dropping out of
one or more of their courses but
continuing to take others if they
wish.

If students choose to do so, they
will receive a temporary grade of
“incomplete” in the courses, and
will be required to make up the
work they miss before September
30. If the work is not accomplished
by that date, they will receive per-
manent grade of “F.”

The faculty also voted to devote
“all available resources” of the Uni-
versity to conduct seminar-type pro-
grams throughout the remaining
two weeks of classes to analyze the
“economic, political, philosophical,
and sociological ramifications of the
Indochina War” and “other prob-
lems—present and potential—facing
our society and our world.”

President Robert E. R. Huntley
announced the faculty’s new action
following Monday night’s meeting.
which had been scheduled before
the results of the student referen-
dum were announced.

The faculty resolution did not
suspend final examinations, although
it did recognize the “significant and
sincere expression of concern about
major issues” on the part of the stu-
denis.

Ihe faculty’s action is an exten-
sion of a resolution approved last
week permitting students to absent
themselves for the rest of the semes-
ter, but not on a selective, class-by-
class basis.

Last Thursday, the faculty passed
a motion permitting students to ab
sent themselves from classes on an
individual basis if their consciences
direct them to do so. Under that
faculty action, work would
have to be made up before Sept. 30.

voted for a resolution which asked

students who felt that they would
conscientiously continue their work.

In a scheduled referendum Mon-
day, students voted four-to-one to
ask the faculty to suspend classes
for the rest of the semester unless
individual students and professors
arrange on their own to continue
course work,

With 96.5 per cent of the 1400
member student body voting, 1,065
votes—80.7—were cast in favor of
the motion seeking the so-called
“soft-shutdown.”

Only 254 votes, 19.3 percent,
were cast against the resolution,
which had been endorsed by both
the current year’s and next year’s
Executive Committees.

“The faculty of Washington and

Leaders Ask For Stability

Huntley Clarifies Faculty
Action For Student Body

 

Me oh |

“Do not confuse lack of agreement with lack of concern,” said Presi-
dent Huntley in his Tuesday afternoon speech to the student body as-
sembled on the lawn in front of Lee Chapel.

Student Leaders Condemn
ge rresponsible” Activities

Senior Gates Shaw convened an
informal student body assembly of
about 400 yesterday afternoon in
front of Lee Chapel with the words
“This is going to be truth.” The
meeting had been called by Presi-
dent-elect Fran Lawrence at the
boycott rally yesterday morning.

Phil Thompson, vice-president
elect of the Student Body, was the
first speaker, talking in behalf of the
current Executive Committee.

Thompson said that “the ultimate
responsibility of the EC is to repre
sent sentiment.” He stated that in
the “informal session of the com
bined Executive Committees held at
midnight on Monday had “condemn
ed the lack of faith” shown by the
faculty.

Having talked
Huntley yesterday afternoon, how
ever, Thompson felt that the E¢
had as we could in
responsible manner’ that “no
more could be derived from attempt
at modification,”

Thompson explained the faculty
felt obligated to the University to
continue the present, formal curri
culum requirements. He felt that
the situation had reached “a stand
still.”

Thompson felt everything possible

President Robert E. R. Huntley
spoke yesterday to a University as-
sembly conducted in front of Lee
Chapel, attempting to explain the
ramifications of Monday's faculty
decision on the overwhelming ap-
proved student referendum.

At the same time he commented
upon the events of the past several
days on the Washington and Lee
campus.

Huntley opened the proceedings
by reading the faculty’s report on
the referendum, and followed with
presentations of “clarifications” of
both the original and the revised
faculty proposals,

He stressed that any senior who
exercised the “I” option and post-
poned his work until September
would be postponing his graduation
until October.

He also addressed remarks to stu-
dents intending to refrain from regi-

stration this week, pointing out that
such students would be given the
opportunity to register in eStpember
and would be, under long-standing
University policy, a part of the Uni-
versity during the summer.

The President believed that the
faculty shares the students’ concern
and had acted, in his belief, respon-
sibly.

The defeat of the proposed pass-
fail option, which was understood
clearly by the faculty, was the result
of two factors, the President said.

First, Washington and Lee has no
way at this time, of assessing the
wisdom of taking the option, and
secondly, such an option was con-
sidered “tantamount to cancelling
the operations of the University.”

The President closed the meeting
by urging students not to “con-
fuse lack of agreement with lack of
concern,”

 

(Editor's Note: The following
is the text of a statement issued
by President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley on May 11, 1970. It is not
intended as the text of his speech
before the student body Tues-
day; however, it does outline his
feelings concerning the faculty
resolution passed Monday night.)

I do not believe it can be said
the faculty “rejected” Monday's
student resolution. The faculty
clearly wished to express affir-
matively that it shares the deep
concern of students on national
issues, and wishes to underscore
the importance of that concern
in every way which is consistent
with their responsibility.

The faculty intended to accept
—and | believe it is perfectly
clear from the wording the fac-
ulty used that the faculty did in
fact accept—every premise which
the student resolution contained
in support of its position.

It can hardly be said that the
faculty made no substantial
changes in the policy it had
adopted only last week—a policy,
incidentally, which only four
days ago was all that the students

 

A Statement From The President

asked for.

It can hardly be said that the
faculty has merely “re-affirmed”
its action of Thursday. Last
night's resolution represents a
significant extension of that ac-
tion in an important respect.

Of the requests contained in
the student resolution, explicit or
interpreted by students as being
implied in it, the faculty turned
down just one.

That one would have cancelled
all academic work outright for
anybody for any reason. I be-
lieve that implementing that ac-
tion would be tantamount to
closing Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, and closing the univer-
sity, or taking any action which
would lead to a de facto closing
of the University, would in my
view and in the view of the fac-
ulty be unfair and unwise.

| remain impressed with the
reasonable and thoughtful atti
tude being taken by the great
majority of Washington and Lee's
students, who understand the
substantial new options given
them by the faculty and who I
hope now wish to get down to
the business of exercising them.

President Robert E. R. Huntley,
May 11, 1970

[t is impossible for anyone in this community to step back
and evaluate this past week objectively; and we will not be so
foolish as to make the claim that we will be able to.

It seems that the spirit which engendered the events of
the past week has been wasted in what has become our own
World War I —a trench warfare of dialogue set in a jungle
of confusion. We must make a conscious effort now to revive
that original spirit.

On the part of the students this spirit is of a deep and
sincere distress in a time of national moral crisis. Unfortun-
ately, there seems to be a danger in that the sharing of this
spirit by the faculty has not been recognized by the student
body. The fact is, this concern is mutual; the faculty and stu-
dents both agree.

The spark of concern that has been enkindled on campus
must not be put out in a backfire of misunderstanding. The
faculty and the students have intensely considered the issues.
It is not a time for coercion; we must not wage war here. The
spirit of deep and sincere concern must be directed once
again to the original issues involved.

Faculty and students should lay aside their misapprehen-
sions about each other’s relative opinions. We should all take
advantage of the opportunities that have been made available
by the actions taken——and come together.

Two Views On

By Dave Olson

“This has been a tremendous re-
affirmation of the potential of the
WAL student body. There is hope.”
Fran Lawrence stated the case beau-
tifully.

We have seen in the past few days
an extraordinary series of acts on
the part of the student body. What
they have done is, to this writer,
amazing. We have come out of our
noted apathy and worked. We have
worked hard to do something to-
gether, and we did.

It took Kent State to do it, but we
did take action. If we, as a student
body, can keep this kind of action
going, we can advance by leaps and
bounds next year. The only problem
is that these advances are contingent
on the acceptance of them by the
faculty and the administration.

What the faculty failed to realize
in their perfunctory, though sincere
consideration of the student pro-

posal is that they no longer are re-
quired to look after our well-being.
We are here to learn, not to be ad-

Virginia Beach” was a_ statement
heard from more than one member
of the faculty.

It astounds me that these faculty
members could so miss the point of
the student resolution. It was not an
attempt at getting out the easy way.
It was an attempt to achieve the
freedom that is necessary to do what
we have to do.

The reason the student resolution
got turned down is unclear, but
these are some likely choices. One,
the faculty could have a great great
lack of perception, but that is un-
likely.

They could feel that if they had
done something like institute pass-
fail, no one would show up for
their classes. I do not think the fac-
ulty is that sensitive. I think they
turned it down because of outside
pressure and certain things they
realized about the position of W&L

Certainly much of our money
comes from rather conservative
sources, and these sources would be
displeased (to say the least) if this
school had shut down, or if 80 per
cent of the student body left which
they probably would have done if a
pass-fail option had been instituted.
Can we blame the faculty? I think
not. For many of the faculty, WAL
is their whole life, their “raison
d'etre.”

They would not want to take a
step that would endanger the life of
this university and subsequently
their jobs. It is a very real and a
very human consideration, but |
wonder if, at this juncture in the
school year, if pass-fail (which really
was the desire of the students)
would have made that great a diff-
erence.

I don’t think it would have, and
many schools (Brown and Yale in-
cluded) have pass-fail for every-
thing. Would it have made that
much difference if W&L had done
it for one semester?

rhe faculty seems to feel so be-
cause it would look bad to graduate
schools,

The faculty still clings to the idea
that they have to protect us from
the onerous possibility. It is a mani-
festation of the idea of in loco par
entis, and even more so, the genera-
lion gap.

The difference is that the faculty
feels that they have to retain a cer-
tain semblance of hierarchy and ad-
ministrative security while the stu-
dents feel that WAL has to make 4

By Reeve Kelsey

The crisis continues, but today
one hopes that the worst is over.
What happened and what does it
mean? One has observed a generally
activist student body and a flexible
response on the part of the faculty.

The initial faculty action showed
an understanding on the part of the
faculty of the need to combine the
deisres of the concerned students
with the academic integrity of the
University.

The faculty action with its Mon-
day night amendments allows those
students who feel intellectual pur-
suits are no longer germaine to the
problems they face to leave the Uni-
versity community and make up
their work at a later time. The fac-
ulty action also reaffirmed the basic
purpose of the University—to teach
and to be a home for intellectual
activities in all disciplines,

rhe student resolution, itself, was
a poorly worded document offering
something for everyone.

We feel that a resolution of this
nature must stand independent of
outside interpretations. The student
proponents cannot invoke the plea
of Humpty Dumpty when he said,
“When I use a word it means just
what I choose it to mean—neither
more nor less.”

There was not something in the
resolution that appealed to all stu-
dents, even the 254 who explicitly

rejected the proposal. The resolu-
tion did contain two regretable
phrases, “closing Washington and

Lee” and “Declare all classes can-
celled.” If the proponents of the re
solution did not really want classes
cancelled, why were these two
phrases left in the proposal?

The second major objection to the
plan was that there was no guaran-
tee that classes would continue as
scheduled. A professor would not
have been obligated to continue
classes.

There are many other problems
involved in ending the semester on
May 6. Is it really ethically justifi
able to give a student a “B” for
four-fifths of the work of last year's
“B” student? How does a professor
really give a grade if the only work
to be turned in for the course was

“W &L’s student

body is now activist—
the days of apathy are
at last truly dead and
buried. It is the job
of student leadership
to channel this ac-
tivism into posi-

tive results.”’

Aftermath

the final exam?

What does this mean for the fu-
ture? W&L’s student body is now
activist—the days of apathy are at
last truly dead and buried. It is the
job of the student leadership to
channel this activism into positive
results. Results that complement the
goals of the University.

The long run implications of the
student action are of such signific-
ance not to be overlooked. Is the
abandoning of a structured curri-
culum a decision that should be
made under the immediate stress
of an outside issue?

There is much to be said for an
unstructured curriculum with the
student doing what he desires. Next
year’s short term is an effort to
postively face this issue.

Furthermore the faculty's pres-
ent resolution has serious ramifica-
tions. Can any student at any time
for any reason withdraw and re-
ceive an “I” grade? The implica-
tions of the student resolution
even more severe.

Does a student have the right to
leave classes at any time for a rea
sonable cause and receive a “P” for
the work that he misses? Again
these are all legitimate questions,
but ones that should not be resolved
in the fast moment of the events of
last week.

Yesterday's assembly seemed to
focus directly on who should weild
the power in a university. We have
long argued that the faculty should
not act “in loco parentis” and we
will continue to.

are

However, we feel that the faculty
or the administration should have
ultimate jurisdiction over matters
pertaining to the curriculum. The
students should not have the final,
ultimate jurisdiction over what
courses to be offered, how the cur
riculum should be structured of
what professors should be hired

There should be

student repre
sentation in these decisions, and
there has been increasing student

participation in these areas

There now exists a tremendous
force for action in the student body,
let us hope that it is used to the
benefit of the entire

By Greg Raetz

For a week now the only issue on
this campus, and most other camp-
uses around the country, has been
student protest against the war, On
Monday W&L students registered
their opinions on what our univer-
sity’s role should be in this nation-
wide movement. By better than four
to one the students voted to “close.”
(It is left to each who reads the pro-
posal to decide what this word
means.) On Monday evening the
faculty considered thte issue.

The results are known to all of
us. What has been obscured in the
aftermath of the faculty vote are the
multitude of considerations which
faced the faculty in addition to the
clear mandate by the students to
“close” the University.

It is easy to look at the lopsided
“yes” vote of the student body and
conclude that the faculty and ad-
ministration arbitrarily overruled
the wishes of the students. This,
however, assumes that there is some
sort of divine right in the majority
and that the majority is always right.
It also assumes that all other con-
siderations individually and in total
are less important than the student
vote, a vote that has no real author-
ity to do anything except to apprise
the faculty of student opinion.

The faculty in making their de-
cision on the course to be taken by
the University had to consider the
impact that this decision would have
on the future policy of the Univer-
sity. Harvard and Princeton stu-
dents, after closing down their
schools, are now demanding a two
week holiday just before this fall's
Congressional elections. They'll
probably get it partly because they
know that the administration will

give in. In other words, an un-
healthy precedent has been set.
Washington and Lee chose not to
set this kind of precedent.

Another consideration that cannot
be overlooked is the alumni. Their
support and favor are essential to
the success of W&L. They contribute
not only financially, but also by ac-
tively recruiting prospective students.
Alumni are notoriously unsympathe-
tic to demands and threatened vio-
lence, and there is no reason to be-
lieve that they would feel any diff-
erently in this case.

The very nature of the student
proposal forced the faculty to con-
sider the student vote cum grano
salis. From the beginning the word-
ing was unclear, Because of the lack
of clarity the proposal meant differ-
ent things to different people. Conse-
quently there were “concern” votes,
“beach” votes, “fear” votes and who
all knows what other kinds of votes.
The fact that the proposal passed
became less important than the rea-
sons for its passage and some of the
reasons were not too good,

Each of the considerations men-
tioned above and many more, could
not overcome the student considera-
tion individually. But collectively
they should and did. The business of
the University is education and
there has been precious little of it in
the last week. It is time to realize
that and get back to work.

New Curriculum: A Cornucopia Of Courses

By Skip Paukert

With the registration of students
this week for the coming year’s
courses, the long, arduous efforts of
both faculty and students that creat-
ed the new curriculum seem to have
reached their climax. Although
many are apprehensive of the minor
problems which are bound to plague
the first years of any such innova-
tion, the general response to the
new schedule and courses is favor-
able.

If there exists a common direc-
tion underlying the varied reforms
of each department, it may be ex-
pressed quite succintly: more free-
dom. This new flexibility is not only
evident in the introduction of inde-
pendent study during the spring
term; it is reflected in broader dis-
tribution requirements, wider course
offerings, more seminars and tutor-
ials, fewer prerequisite restrictions,
and more flexible major require-
ments.

Students from all departments will
be going abroad during the spring
term, Journalism majors will be
working on their local newspapers
for credit, Religion students will be
delving into the mysteries of yoga,
and Sociology students will be serv-
ing internships for welfare work, In
short the possible avenues of learn-
ing should well nigh stagger the
boldest of imaginations.

Certainly the most publicized pro-
gram to be introduced next year is
the Spring term’s study abroad.
Language majors will receive the op-
portunity of living with a family
while studying in France, Spain, or
Germany. The Language depart-
ments are adopting, in the words of
Dr. Drake of Romance Languages,
“the outlook that the idiom conveys
the spirit and culture of a people.”
At the same time the program will
be open to students in other fields,

 

such as Political Science and His-
tory, to do research abroad and si-
multaneously gain a lingual and cul-
tural experience.

The Spring term will also provide
time for independent study in other
departments. According to Dr. Kim-
brough of Sociology, students will
be taking a more “active posture”
in their educational endeavors, per-
haps visiting a business firm for ana-
lysis or utilizing a computer for a
methodological survey, Dr. Buch-
anan of the Politics Department
visualizes students undertaking in-

Perhaps there is going to be the
chance to explore in depth the back-
ground of the Indochina war. Per-
haps there are going to be blocks of
time to discuss power, its uses and
abuses. Perhaps there is going to be
people-talk to define and refine our
idea of the new world that is so
painfully evolving.

There are books and books avail-
able for us to investigate. Often one
author leads us on to others. For
starters (and let us not stop!) we
could dig into such books as:
“Limits of Intervention” by Hoopes
“The U.S. and China” by Fairbank
“Thailand, Burma, Laos and Cam-

bodia” by Cady
“Towards Disengagement in Asia”

by Gordon
“The Power Elite” by Mills
“Who Governs” by Dahl
“Protest: Pacifism and Politics” by

“Makings of a Counter-Culture” by

ternships in State government at
Richmond or other work of this
type off-campus.

Students of the Commerce School
may become involved in private busi-
nesses during the spring, and the
prospect of long field trips is now
before biology and geology students.
Therefore, in nearly every depart-
ment the Spring term offers some
form of independent study, be it on
or off campus, to fit the needs and
desires of the individual student.

Asian Economics will continue

Your Bookstore bill will be
mailed out by the end of this week.
It must be paid before the student
leaves campus. Mrs. Betty Munger,
manager, warns that a 10% summer
carry-over charge will be added
after June Sth. Also, all unpaid bills
after that date will be recorded on
the students’ transcripts which will
be withheld until payment. Mrs.
Munger added that the Bookstore is
in danger of major malnutrition un-
vont everyone feeds it well with hard
cash!

through the first term, and the Phil-
osophy department plans to offer a
course in Contemporary Radical
Political Thought.

An indication of the academic
movement to broaden perspectives
and to confront modern problems is
the increasing use of an interdiscip-
linary approach. This development
is evident in the areas of Compar-
itive Literature and History. Mem-
bers of both the Classics and His-
tory departments will share the po-
dium on a course in Ancient His-
torians and Histriography.

A dramatic example of interde-
partmental cooperation is the pro-
posed Seminar Colloquim for fresh-
men on the population problem.
The staff will represent seven de-
partments, from religion and philo-
sophy to biology and economics.
Biology Professor Nye has also in-
itiated a study to establish a similar
program dealing with environmental
problems.

Of course, this increased flexibil-
ity and freedom for the student has
not occurred suddenly in direct cor-
relation with the curriculum. “This
change has been constantly reflected
through the years, giving us a very
highly developed department for
undergraduates,” remarked Dr. Grif-
fith of Economics—and indeed the
same words could have emanated
from the lips of almost any depart-
ment chairman at Washington and
Lee.

Yet with the new courses, lessen-
ed restrictions, and the 12-12-6 for-
mat facing us this coming year, the
WAL student possesses a fresh and
creative challenge toward the self-
guidance of a truly liberal educa-
tion,

W&L Takes Fourth In Overall CAC’s

(During a period of extreme ten-
sion, the athletic teams of W&L
continued their efforts for the com-

munity. This can only be regarded
as a true sacrifice and deserves the
highest praise.)

Baseball Fintshes Second

The Washington and Lee baseball
team travelled to the C.A.C. Spring
Sports Festival in Sewanee sporting
an unimpressive 6-9 record. But the
Generals finished with a second
place in the baseball competition,
which was the highest finish by any
of the W&L teams. The tourney en-
abled the Generals to advance their
record to 7-10 for the season. This
was a drop from the 11-9 record

posted last season, but Coach Lyles
felt that this was still his best team
ever.

The Generals started the weekend
competition off on Friday against
the Colonels from Centre College in
Danville, Kentucky. The Colonels
jumped off to an early lead as they
scored one run in the opening frame
against W&L freshman hurler Bruce
King. The Generals bounced back
quickly to tie the score in the second
inning when Ellie Gutshall’s boom-
ing double into right center field
scored Scotty McHrystal from sec-
ond base.

The next inning told the story of
the game as the usually silent W&L
bats erupted for 7 runs. The big
blow came off the bat of catcher
Jack Baizley as he cracked his first
round-tripper ever. Ellie Gutshall
contributed another double as he
drilled a fast ball about 390 feet to
center field.

The game then settled into a
pitcher's dual with Centre gradually
eating away the 7 run W&L advant-
age. Bruce King was pulled in favor
of sophomore junk-baller Bill Green-
er. The score stood at 10-9 as the
game entered the last of the ninth.
Centre was not willing to die and
they placed runners on first and
second base with only one out.
Greener then got the next Centre
hitter to hit a soft line drive, that
looked like a sure base hit, behind
second base.

Second baseman John Nolan then
made a game saving catch as he
dove to snare the soft liner, then
flipped to the shortstop covering
second to force the runner and end
the game. The final score was 10-9,
and by virtue of a good draw the
Generals moved into the champion-
ship round against defending cham-
pion Washington University.

The Bears of Washington Univer-
sity took control after a slow start
and destroyed the Generals in the
final game by a score of 12-4. W&L

Bill Gatlin shows the form that

built an early lead on the strength of
some clutch hitting by John Nolan
and Ray Coates’ towering circuit
clout in the fourth inning, plus the
masterful pitching wizardry of ace
Bill Miller, who constantly worked
himself out of tight situations.

Then in the sixth inning the roof
fell in on Miller. Two walks and
two extra base hits brought Coach
Lyles to the mound to replace Mil-
ler with Greener. As it turned out
Washington was not finished with its
battering of the W&L mound crew.
All in all, 5 W&L pitchers were
kayoed for 11 runs in the final inn-
ings.

So the Generals early 4-1 lead
was wiped out. The Generals threat-
ened various times in the late inn-

got him to

   

lt
the finals in the CAC,

ings only to have the Washington
pitcher strike out the key batter. It
was the fifth consecutive baseball
bell for the St. Louis ball club.

The Generals placed two players
on the All C.A.C. team. Secondbase-
man and Co-captain John Nolan
who played errorless ball and contri-
buted some timely hits was justly
rewarded, Next year’s captain, jun-
ior Ray Coates made all C.A.C.
outfield on the strength of his bat in
the final game and also errorless
ball in the field. Many felt that
catcher Jack Baizley, who led all
WAL hitters and played superb de-
fense should have been awarded a
C.A.C, berth, but the opposing
coaches chose the Sewanee catcher
over “Clooty.”

Tennis Team Takes

Fourth In The CAC’s

By Lee Thalheimer

Washington and Lee’s tennis team
met a very disappointing end to a
great season, After doing extremely
well throughout the season during
which time they lost only two
matches to very strong teams from
Duke and U.Va., they were upset
at the CAC tournament at Sewanee.
The season record of 10-2 was the
best ever under Coach Canfield.

Neer Captures 3rd CAC Crown

The Washington and Lee Track
Generals once again participated in
the annual spring conference meet
held at Sewanee this year, Last year
at Centre College in Kentucky, the
team managed a_ successful cam-
paign, finishing second,

WAL finished with a fifth place
showing.

The first day of the meet progress-
ed well for the Generals as Mike
Neer once again easily brushed off
all other high jump competition and
he streaked to his third consecutive
victory at the conference meet. He
was unable to raise his record as
there was no competition to press
him. Dave Stone handed in a fine
performance, taking fourth place in
the high jump, making six feet. He
will refinitely figure into the future
of the team with Neer graduating,

The triple jump provided disap-
pointment as Mike Neer was only
able to take fourth and no one else

even qualified. Mike Carrere put
the Generals back on the winning
track as he followed in Neer’s foot-
steps and took his third consecutive
javelin conference championship.
But as in Neer’s case, he was not
able to better his record,

The consistent problem for the
track team all year long has been
their lack of sprinters, and this prov-
ed out very significantly at the con-
ference meet. The General sprint
relay struggled to a fifth place finish,
and no one was able to qualify for
the 100, 220, or 440 yard dashes.
This killed all chances for any hope
of a decent finish.

The second day of competition
was a long uphill climb for the
track squad with few highlights. The
440 yard hurdles and one mile run
failed to produce any points, but
Paul Suthern and Mike Neer storm-
ed back taking a second and fourth
place. Suthern is only a freshman,

Tennis Team Takes CAC Fourth

(Continued from Page 4)

The CAC seemed to go all wrong
for the Generals. For a start Driscoll
became sick and had to default in
singles and doubles. From the look
of the draw he would have reached
the finals in both. At the number
three spot Washburn had the bad
luck of drawing the winner in the
first round. Bill Gatlin at number
one reached the finals only to lose in
a hard fought match. At the number
six spot McJunkin reached the finals
where he won the first set easily
only to end up losing. Rick Arm-
strong, the number five man, had
an especially bad time, being elimi-
nated in the first round, after being
the number one seed.

In doubles the number one team
had to default. The number two
team did win their first match, but
lost in their third. The number three
team reached the finals. Although
leading in both sets, Armstrong and
McJunkin eventually fell to defeat,
ending W&L’s bid in CAC competi-
tion,

Despite the disappointing loss the
season had to be considered a suc-
cess. The team had a fine record
and all of the squad besides the
starting six got a chance to play.

The team worked hard in all
matches, There were several matches
in which the outcome depended on
doubles and these cases W&L won.

Individually the members of the
team had a fine season, Washburn
and Driscoll led the team in vic-
tories with eight. Washburn was par-
ticularly exciting since in three or
four matches he fell way behind
only to come back and win. Driscoll
was the boy with the most hard
luck. Besides the illness at the CAC,
he had back trouble all year that
hampered his serve, which might be
the best serve on the team. He still
managed to compile a great record,
and since he is just a sophomore,
he will be back. Tom McJunkin, the
captain of the team, also had a good
year. He led the team in won-lost
percentage. It was especially re-
warding to him, since, due to foot-
ball, his tennis game was a little
off at first. From hard work he was
able to come back and have a tre-
mendous season.

Bill Gatlin had a very competitive
year playing at number one, and he
will be back next year to lead the
Generals. Stanley Taylor had a hard
year at number two, but he is just
a freshman and will have three
more years to play.

Rick Armstrong had another
great year for the Generals. This
was his third varsity year, and next
year the team will sorely miss him.
One other player who had a good
year was John Keefauver. He com-
piled a strong 6-2 record, but un-
fortunately wasn't able to make the
CAC trip.

While the players and Coach Can-
field were disappointed, they offered
no excuses. They all have hopes for
next year, however, with the top
four players returning and besides
Coach Canfield has never been one
to make a habit of losing.

ery who shows much promise for
next season, and Shaner is a fresh-

well as he took a third in the broad

Golf Squad Ends Year;
Places 5th In Tournament

By Dick Singletary

The 1970 golf season was a disap-
pointment for Washington and Lee,
Having lost three starters from last
year, the team was faced with a re-
building year.

The season began favorably
though with a win over Bucknell at
the Upper Cascades course, which
was the home course for the links
men of W&L this year. The hopes
of an undefeated season did not last,
however, when a surprising team
from Madison upset the Generals.

After a trip to Norfolk, where the
golfers lost to East Carolina and
tied Old Dominion, W&L went to
the state championships at the Cas-
cades. A presentable showing by
Ken Carter, who shot at 154, was
all that salvaged the day, however,
as the Generals dropped to a dismal
eleventh.

WAL hung on to win over Hamp-

den-Sydney and tied Roanoke to
bring the season to a 2-2-2 record.
In the final effort of the year, the
Generals retired Bridgewater to end
a winning but disappointing season.
Finally, in the CAC’s last week,
Carter and Marquess ended two days
at 158 to tie for W&L’s low when
the Generals tied down last spot in
the golf event.

With returning lettermen Ken
Carter, Jack Marquess, Bill Martin,
Brandon Herbert, and Bob Storey,
the Coach believes he has the nu-
cleus for a respectable team. And
respectable they must be, since the
schedule includes next year David-
son, Duke, and U.Va. Also the Gen-
erals next year are looking forward
to the opening of the 18 hole Lex-
ington Country Club as their home
course again, which they hope to be-
come the sight of continued W&L
success.
