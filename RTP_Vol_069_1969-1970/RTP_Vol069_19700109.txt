“It was thought that a freshman
is now placed in a market-place in
which he must make too hasty a de-
cision on joining a fraternity,” Dean
John said. “It was felt that ‘con-
sumer protection’ was needed both
for students and the fraternities in
that both need a longer time to
look around and to make rational
decisions.”

The delayed pledging system will
also be another step in providing
students with viable alternatives in
campus life, he noted. Other steps
in that direction include the Uni-
versity Center which opened last
fall, the liberalized dormitory social
regulations, and the plan to allow
freshmen to have cars.

In announcing the gift, W&L

President Robert E. R. Huntley re-

tradition and future aspiration is

graduates men who, like Robert
Fortune, have that rare combina

perspective, and fine character. We
are grateful for these important
gifts which will provide boosts to-
ward the continued development of

After graduation, Robert Fortune

Colvin Withdraws From Race

Dr. Milton Colvin, who has taught
political science at Washington and
Lee since 1961, has decided that he
will not run in the Virginia Demo-
cratic primary against U.S. Senator
Harry F. Byrd, Jr.

In a statement Wednesday, Colvin
placed the blame for his decision
to withdraw on a lack of funds.
He explained that he had received
in the neighborhood of $25,000 in
pledges, but would most likely re-
quire another $30,000 to make the
campaign possible.

“I have gotten some money, but
not enough,” Colvin stated Wednes-
day, adding, “I think it unrealistic
to start out on a campaign with-
out adequate funding, and I think
it unfair to take enthusiastic sup-
porters down a political road when
there is a near certainty that by
April the bridge will be out.”

Emphasizing that it was almost
completely a matter of financial

worries which caused him to make
his decision, Colvin admitted that
he was leaving the door “a little
ajar.”

To stress this, Colvin added, “If
you're asking me whether I will
come into the race if someone were
to supply me with enough money,
the answer is yes, on a white horse!”

Arrangements with the admini-
stration to provide a replacement
for him during the spring semester
had already been worked out he
said, and there was nothing along
those lines to interfere with his
potential candidacy.

Earlier in the year, before Christ-
mas, Colvin issued a statement sum-
marizing his campaign as doing
“well in terms of support, bul poor
in terms of money. If you hold
the middle ground as | do, you
don't get money from either labor
or business. Even a ‘poor man's’
campaign will run a minimum of

Repeating this week his assess-
ment of a moderate’s problems
getting financial backing, Colvin
pointed out that no big interest, such
as banking, business, labor, and so
on, will support a political mod-
erate at the outset, preferring to
back either an avowed conservative
or liberal.

Since he has withdrawn, however,
Colvin stated that he personally
would like to see Democratic gub-
ernatoral candidate William C.

Senator Henry Howell, Governor

expressed an interest in running. He
defeated former Rep. Howard Smith
in a 1966 battle in the Democratic
primary but then lost the election
Until this year he has been a mem-
ber of the House of Delegates.

Colvin—no stranger to the politi
cal scene—soughi a seat in the
House of Representatives from his
native Montana before coming to
WAL. He expressed, however, the
observation that the costs of that
election and the projected expenses
of this race were different enough
to make his earlier attempt almost
useless as far as gaining experience
in gathering financial support is
concerned

However, in this short
campaign, Colvin paid special at
tention to the students both here
and at other schools across the state
He said the students were always
enthusiastic and willing to work,
and he observed that “the response

assessing

of the students has convinced me
more than ever that Senator Byrd
will get very few votes of those

under 30.”

Besides the students, Colvin ex
pressed his thanks to the “many
Democrats, liberal Republicans
and independents who made known
to me their interest in my candidacy
and their willingness to help out,”

Admissions Report

The report of the student sub-committee on admissions,
incomplete through they admitted it was, has to rank in
approach with among the most thorough, penetrating and
constructive studies we have seen undertaken here.

In substance, the sub-committee, headed by Dave Bethea,
proposed rather sweeping innovations in admissions, recruit-
ing and orientation programs in order to attract disadvantag-
ed students.

We were surprised to find presented such sound possible
solutions to a problem (that of excessive homogeneity in the
student body) the University has approached only with pro-
visional measures and therefore rather ineffectively. This is
not to say the report was simplistic. As nearly as we have
been able to discover, its proposals so far deal realistically
with the difficulty on both a long- and short-term basis.

The competence this sub-committee has exhibited will,
we hope, encourage more student study groups of this nature
and prompt the faculty and administration to continue in and
expand their policy of seeking student advice in important
matters,

Hopefully, it will also encourage interested students to
initiate their own studies when answers don’t seem to be
forthcoming from other sources.

The impact of the study will, if its proposals are adopted,
significantly alter, we believe for the better, the composition
and character of the student body and therefore of the Uni-
versity. Some kind of transition appears inescapable anyway.
Current trends in College Board scores indicate W&L’s
successive freshman classes, by standards the University im-
poses, are declining in ability. Thus to continue in the present
direction is to choose, consciously or not, a school for rich
boys dedicated to the “gentleman’s C” that has not been
the norm here for some time.

The sub-committee, it seems to us, offers the only al-
ternative to that trend. It proposes to bring disadvantaged
students here, by various means which appear effective to
us, in order immediately to provide for a more heterogenous
student body. The long-run effect, we agree, will be to re-
verse the disappointing trend in W&L’s quest for good stu-
dents from whatever economic class or location.

The greatest difficulty lies in the means to that end. The
sub-committee would propose that College Board scores,
which reflect in general the degree to which one has assimi-
lated the pervasive American culture, be de-emphasized in
favor of a more individual evaluation of specific applicants’
motivation and potential. Even if we did not consider the
overall result worth the chance, and we do, it nevertheless
seems to us that W&L, since its boasts personal attention to
each student, ought to operate more often on that basis
anyway. Certainly its size does not preclude the possibility.

We hope we have not prejudged this sub-committee’s
final report, nor that we have established an incorrect con-
text or emphasis for its reception. We have meant merely to
state our position and encourage a thorough consideration
of the report when it is complete.

Approaching Deferred Rush

The faculty Monday once again passed a resolution te-
quiring a deferred fraternity rush, and in conjunction
they have decided to allow freshmen cars beginning next
year. The latter is a constructive, if not altogether safe, ap-
proach to the social problems freshmen will face due to de-
ferred rush.

The social problems upperclassmen in fraternities are
going to face is another matter. Further diminished incomes
to houses already under financial stress, added to the pres-
sures rush during classes will incur for everyone, challenges
the fraternities through the Interfraternity Council likewise
to face the problem constructively and discover safegaurds.

So far, IFC reaction has been wholly negative. Dan
Leonard and IFC President Chuck Cahn argued prior to
the faculty vote that the fraternities should be allowed to
legislate their own reforms. We agree that this is the
optimum solution. However, fraternities, faced with the in-
evitability of deferred rush for several years, have done
nothing but stall and hope the dilemma would disappear.
It has not. Indeed, it reappears with increasing insistence and
frequency, and sooner or later IFC tactics will cease to prevail,

Recent action by the Judicial Board offers encourage-
ment that a collective solution to the increased financial prob-
lems may be found, although present recommendations deal
only with the current difficulties of most, if not all, houses
and offer no real solution to the diminished incomes result-
ing from deferred rush.

Moreover, the conflict of school work with rush will
have to be minimized, both for freshmen and for upper-
classmen, if either group is going to consider even the pos-
sibility of rush.

None of these difficulties is insurmountable if the IFC
adopts the same constructive approach to its problems that
the faculty took to alleviate the difficulties its action would
impose on freshmen. Recent activity in the IFC indicates that
a constructive approach may be adopted, but history leaves
us unconvinced.

By MONTY COTTIER

Ten years ago, the Ring-tum Phi
characterized the decade which was
then drawing to a close as one of
“great changes and _ important
events.” Strange as this might seem
to anyone who remembers what the
Fifties were like, and momentous
and innovative as these last ten years
have been, it should none the less
caution anyone who thinks that he
has seen great times (or, conversely,
very bad times) that they might
honestly have “seen nothing yet,”
as the Phi of 1959-60 put it.

For example, that year saw the
retirement of W&L’s president for
29 years, Dr. Francis Pendleton
Gaines. It also brought the news
that the IFC had developed a de-
ferred rush program, and wanted
the faculty to give it consideration.
The Mock Convention was held in
May of 1960, nominating the Mass-
acheussets senator, John F, Ken-
nedy. Dr. Sensabaugh retired as
Dean of the University to spend
his time teaching, and Dean Farrar
was named Director of Financial
Aid,

In 1960-61, the first issue of the
Phi proclaimed “75% Pledge!” and
warned of the impending doom of
the fraternity system if this trend
were not reversed. The IFC de-
ferred rush program was defeated,
and, also in connection with the
Rush Week activities, the ZBT’s
and the Phi Eps broke a long-
standing “gentlemen's agreement”
by rushing gentile boys and causing
dire predictions concerning the fate
of the fraternity system.

Dean Pusey was named Dean of
the College that year, the Robert E.
Lee Research Fund was establish-
ed, and Senator Barry Goldwater
came to Lexington to be the Contact
speaker for that year. Fancy Dress,
which in those days still called for
a costume and a theme, was billed
as being the best ever. The IFC
voted to end “Hell Week,” and the
plan was sent to the Faculty. It
passed, over a loud protestation that
the action would form the first step
in a plan by the faculty to kill
the fraternities. Plans were begun
to build a new science building, as
well as a new dorm complex. In
sports, Lee McLaughlin's football
players had an undefeated season.

The following year saw the be-
ginning of discontent, surfacing at
first in the EC itself, in attempts
to change the government of the
school. A poll tax of $2 was suggest-
ed, along with leadership tests, to
stimulate interest in voting (the poll
tax, collected during matriculation,
would be refunded at the polls) and
to insure that the candidates for
office would be qualified. Since, at
that time, the politics of the stu-
dent body were controlled by the
University Party, the Progressive
Party, and the Independents, this
idea was felt by the EC to be
superfluous.

Also in 1961-62, the EC sought
to have a Judicial Board established
to aid in determining various penal-
ties and to serve as a board of trial
and appeal, which was approved by
the faculty. The College Athletic
Conference was formed, the trustees

blocked a plan to have Martin
Luther King, Jr. speak at the school,
Professor Atwood was made Dean
of Students, and a student body
senate was proposed and defeated.
The IFC ended the second semester
by proposing a delayed rush pro-
gram, which was also defeated.

In 1962-63, the first news story
of the year told the upper-classman
that “75% Have Pledged,” and the
predictions of early deaths and free-
for-alls rising from the abolition of
the Jew-Gentile delineation were not
fulfiilled. In its first full year of
existence, the College Athletic Con-
ference’s All-’Round trophy was
captured by W&L, while the EC
did away with the option of volunt-
ary withdrawal from the university
rather than facing honor trials. The
only other major event in this
scholastic year was the retirement of
Dean Gillam and his appointment
by the trustees as Dean Emeritus.

In 1963-64, Dean Gillam’s post as
Admissions head was filled by Dean
Atwood, Pledging hit an all-time
low that year, with only 70% of the
freshman class signing with a house.
Former President of the university
Francis P. Gaines died in the fall.
He had been chancellor of the school
since his retirement in 1959.

After a year’s work in restoration,
Lee Chapel was reopened and re-
dedicated by W&L’s president Fred
C. Cole. The school’s support for
the magazine The Southern Col-
legian was withdrawn in quite a
bit of controversy. Conflict marked
this year, when the absence rules
were re-written; the Assimilation
Committee, which held the power
of probation and fines in enforcing
such rules as conventional dress and
the speaking tradition, came under
attack from faculty and students
alike: and the faculty passed ap-
proval for the new IFC constitu-
tion, which established the Judicial
Board,

Dr. Feddeman answered claims
and criticisms of incompetence to-
wards the end of the school year,
and the next issue of the paper
announced that due to an epidemic
of German measles Spring vacation
had been canceled.

The University Party once again
swept the elections, but there was a
considerable amount of criticism fol-
lowing this elcetion of the W&L
political system as whole. The Mock
Convention was held in the last
month of the school year, and nomi-
nated Goldwater.

The political system, under attack
in 1963-64, was significantly altered
the next year. The University Party
split. and re-appeared with a whole
new group of houses, Nine fraterni-
ties left whatever party they might
have belonged to and allowed their
members free choice in deciding their
ballots. The faculty ordered the
parties to hold primaries to de-
termine the candidates for the vari-
ous offices, so as to do away with
the practice of having caucuses, or
what the Phi termed “midnight bar-
gaining sessions.”

In a move which was surprising
considering the criticism aimed at
the Assimilation Committee the year
before, the student body voted to

keep the conventional dress tradi-
tion. At the end of the year, the
political situation was further con-
fused by the disbanding of the old
University Party.

1965-66 saw a reduction in the
number of pledges, and serious at-
tention given in the IFC to the
question of deferred rush, A study
was begun on the feasibility of hav-
ing girls in the dorms, while work
was begun renovating and enlarg-
ing the old Co-op. Recognizing a
situation which had existed for a
couple of years, the IFC voted to
abolish separate lists of Jewish and
Gentile freshmen,

The faculty committee requested
that the student body be polled
on the subject of a five-day week,
and was surprised to learn that the
majority of the students favored
keeping the old six-day plan. They
also considered the question of in-
dependent study and a_ shortened
term,

Funds for the Southern Collegian
were Officialy stopped, a plan was in-
troduced and passed in the EC to
establish the Student Affairs Com-
mittee, and, at the end of the year,
Steven R. Saunders became the first
rising junior in 30 years to be
named to the position of editor-in-
chief of the Ring-tum Phi.

In 1966-67, the Co-op was open-
ed. Associate Justice to the Supreme
Court Tom Clark spoke in Lee
Chapel, as did Tom Wolfe, who
graduated from W&L in 1951.

The EC recommended sophomore
dorms, then rejected its own plan

hi W&L’s 1960's: A Retrospection

at the end of the year, The fresh-
men adopted a class constitution,
which was voted down when pre-
sented to the Executive Committee.
The faculty called for the develop-
ment of a deferred rush proposal
by the IFC, and three houses were
convicted of hazing violations,

The 4.0 grade system was intro-
duced that year, replacing the old
three point plan. The first public
honor trial since 1938 was held that
year, and, at the end of the year,
Earl Mattingly, the school’s trea-
surer died and President Fred C.
Cole resigned suddenly. Law school
Dean Charles Light retired and was
replaced by law professor Robert
E. R. Huntley.

To replace Dr. Cole, the trustees
asked the next year if Dean W. W.
Pusey would serve as president pro-
tempore, which he did. The fra-
ternities were greeted with the news
that pledging was about average,
and the first year without the
separate lists for Jews and Gentiles
went off smoothly. Again, the IFC
presented its deferred rush plan,
which met with the same fate as
so many others of a similar nature.
Law School Dean Robert Huntley
was chosen as the next president
of Washington and Lee, to replace
retired President Cole.

Last year, 1968-69, began with
the death of head football coach
Lee McLaughlin. Early in the year
many changes were adopted, be-
ginning with the abolition of Satur-
day classes, which went into effect

Death of Black Panther
Indicates Police State

By DAVE OLSON

The Chicago Police Force has
again made itself famous with an
early morning raid a few weeks ago
on a Black Panther’s headquarters
in Chicago and the resulting death
of Panther leader Dave Hampton.
Whether or not he was murdered
remains to be seen but there cer-
tainly is disagreement on the events
that took place that morning.

The Panthers claim that Hampton
was murdered while sleeping in bed.
The police claim that he fired at
them when they entered his apart-
ment to confiscate an arms cache
and arrest Hampton. What is true
is that Hampton was killed in bed
for the blood stains prove that. The
Panthers have a film that they claim
shows that all the bullet holes in
Hampton's bedroom are entrance
holes which, they claim, proves that
Hampton was assassinated. It is my
belief that Hampton was murdered
but what is more important is the
fact that this raid points up a very
disturbing tendency among law en-
forcement bodies and in the office of
the Attorney General.

It appears to me that there is a
plan on the part of John Mitchell
and Richard Nixon to give the
country what is called “law and
order.” They plan to do this by
inceasing the size and sophistication

ROTC At The University

The College Faculty took an his-
toric step Thursday when it voted
to terminate degree credit for ROTC
courses, It was a step as refresh-
ing as it was unexpecied, for it
showed that the assembled scholars
can, on at least one matter, re-
evaluate old concepts and act to
meet the challenges of this era

Revocation of degree credit should
not, in any way, endanger the exist-
ence of ROTC programs here, a
fact which was probably most in-
fluential in affecting the vote. The
contracts with ROTC staie that some
form of academic credit must be
afforded the military courses. Three
undergraduate professional schools
here still offer full credit: and the
College still offers academic credit.
ROTC courses and grades still ap
pear on the transcript. H's just that
academic credit isn't worth much if
you can't use it to apply for a de-
greee (which leads to an interesting
paradox),

Non-faculty observers were almost
certain before Thursday's meeting
that the faculty would pass one of
the proposals that would only have
referred the matier to a commitice
for more study, and it's interesting
to speculate about why the vote
went as it did. There seemed ito be

no set departmental or interest-group
pattern to the voting. Perhaps the
public relations blunder of the Army
in bringing fourth-year man Paul
Bishop to a hearing had something
to do with it. But the most prob-
able explanation is that all the dis-
cussions about the theory and prac-
tice of a liberal arts education had
led many faculty members to be-
lieve that the surest way to subvert
a liberal arts curriculum is to allow
10 per cent or more of it to be
taken from the ROTC departments.

In any case, degree credit for
ROTC is gone, and its depariure
could have some interesting repre-
cussions, Here at the University.
ROTC will entail a lot more work
enrollment will almost certainly go
down unless the departments make
an effort to replace their courses
with analogous offerings within the
University, Lec. a management of
psychology course in place of a mili-
tary leadership course, and leave the
sirietly mililary subjects to summer
training,

In the Pentagon, the College Fac-
ulty’s decision could start the brass
thinking about revision of the entire
ROTC program. When Ivy League
schools dropped ROTC credit, it
didn’t hurt the national program too
much, But Virginia has always been
considered a model ROTC institu-
tion. And, it is a Stale university.
It may well be thal the example set
here Thursday will be more potent.
will serve notice io the military
establishment thai the old credit
arrangements may be out of date
at more schools than a few radical
northern institutions. If this is the

case, the outcome can only be im-
provement of the existing program.

Al any rate, we eagerly await the
outcome of the committee appointed
to investigate the ramifications of
removing academic credit for ROTC
courses. The committee, which will
make its report no later than the
April 1969 (sic) meeting will hope-
fully reconcile the faculty's present
paradoxical stance and get down to
the real issue: should the faculty
award academic credit for what are
essentially non-academic courses?
We trust the Commitiee’s answer
will be “no” and that the College
faculty will deny academic as well
as degree credit for ROTC courses

of law enforcement agencies and
by this intimidate many extremists
groups to stop their activities. The
strange thing is that the “silent
Majority” is perfectly willing to let
this go on, for they think it is the
solution to the problem. It is not
the solution to the problems that
the country faces today. It is obvi-
ous that the Nixon Administration
misunderstands the problems.

When they decide to stop the
Black Panthers with force they are
attacking an effect rather than a
cause. The Panthers were formed
to protect Black people in this
country. The reason the panther was
chosen as a symbol is because he
is an animal that fights only when
cornered. This is what the Panthers
are all about. They are easily the
most misunderstood group in Amer-
ica. There is something wrong with
the way black people are treated
in this country and the problem is
not going to be solved by killing
off the Black Panthers. Nor is the
problem of riots in the inner city
going to be solved by increasing
the strength of Police reaction. We
have to attack the causes of the
riots, not just the riots which re-
sult from the deterioration of the
urban condition. If greater Police
action stops riots or stops the Black
Panthers, the problem of Urban de-
cay and hatred of the white estab-
lishment will remain.

The most disturbing thing is that
the Nixon administration really fails
to see this point, or even worse they
do not want to see it. I feel that
the administration is trying to create
a conservative reaction in this coun-
try which will insure Nixon's re-
election but | aiso feel that the
law enforcement bodies of this coun-
try will become overly strong and
the result could be something ap-
proaching a police state. Under the
guise of law and order and sadly
without the knowledge of the “Great,
Silent Majority” this country is be-
ing led down the road to even
greater division and hate than now
exists; and the murder of Dave
Hampton is a very large warning
beacon. | only hope that enough
people see it in time and end their
silence.

Swimmers Sink Catholic

Thursday evening before vacation,
the W&L swimmers defeated Catho-
lic University by a 59-46 margin.
This is the first time that W&L has
defeated Catholic in seven years,
Freshman Alan Corwith led the
charge winning two individual events
and participating in a winning relay.

The 400 yard medley relay com-
bination of Hal Catlin, Price Black-
ford, Bim Clark, and Bill Brumback
scored a quick first getting the Gen-
erals off to a 7-0 lead. John Lawlor
followed with a first in the 1000
yard freestyle with a 11:32.2 second
performance. Corwith then won his
first event setting a new school
and pool record in the 200 yard
freestyle with a 1:43.4 mark. Bill
Brumback and co-captain Roger
Martin then went 1-2 in the 50 free-
style so that after 4 events the Gen-
erals had a commanding 26-8 lead.

Ray Hammond and Jay Marks
captured second and third in the
diving. Bim Clark bettered his school
and pool record time that he set in
the Dickinson meet, but Catholic
swimmer, Harry Carey, was even
faster, setting a new pool record in
the 200 yard dolphin butterfly with
a time of 1:58.9.

Tom Murray, John Lawlor, and
Price Blackford then scored seconds
for the Generals in the 200 back
stroke, 500 freestyle, and 200 breast
stroke. Alan Corwith and Roger
Martin went 1-2 in the 100 yard
freestyle.

The Blue natators had a 51-46
lead going into the last event, the
400 yard freestyle relay. Whoever

could win this event, would win the
meet. W&L put forth its best team
of Bim Clark, Roger Martin, Alan
Corwith, and Bill Brumback who
performed a fast 3:08.6 less than
one second off the poll record
The Catholic victory boosts the
General's record to 2-1, while Catho-
lic, the Middle American Confer-
ence swimming champions, now
have a 1-2-1 record. Tomorrow the
Generals travel to the University of
Virginia. Most of the swimming
team members returned Friday be-
fore school started and were swim-
ming up to 6,000 yards a day to
get into condition for the U.Va.
meet, Last year Washington and Lee
and the University of Maryland were
the only schools able to defeat
U.Va. who won the state champion-
ship swimming meet. W&L was un-
able to participate in this meet.

Speaking My Mind...

Daniel leads

Washington and Lee pulled away
in the second half behind the red-
hot marksmanship of sophomore
Mike Daniel to hand Bridgewater a
997-4 defeat last night.

Daniel, working primarily under
the basket, put in 26 points and
grabbed seven rebounds while
flounting a 69% fioor percentage.
Senior Mel Cartwright added 18
points and 13 rebounds to the Gen-
erals’ cause. Big Mike Neer, held to
six points led the team in rebounds
nevertheless. Bill Rhyne collected 13
points and John Glace twisted and

turned for 12 more.
Washington and Lee was suc-
cessful on 51% of its floor shots

while amassing 64 rebounds. Bridge-
water managed only 37 rebounds
and hit only 28 of 70 floor attempts
for a 40% average.

Ron Cook led the
15 points while Dennis Woolfrey
and Rick Wampler contributed 12
points each. Bob Boyle led Bridge-
water on the boards with a dozen
rebounds,

With the Generals leading 36-30,
and with 2 minutes remaining in
the first half, Daniel put in three
straight field goals to stake W&L to
1 42-32 halftime lead. In the sec-
ond half the Generals minimized

the following semester. The IFC
drafted another deferred rush pro-
gram, which was vetoed by the
faculty and withdrawn for rework-
ing. The 12-12-6 study plan, under
consideration by the faculty for
some time, was adopted that year,
to become effective for the year
1970-71, Distribution requirements
were also changed that year, and
plans were drawn up for addition
onto Doremus Gymnasium.

President Huntley was inaugurated
in the late fall of 1968, around the
same time that the EC’s “Bitch-In”
meetings began. Senator George Mc-
Govern was the Contact speaker,
and Hugh Downs came to Lexing-
ton to speak at the annual Phi
Beta Kappa Convocation. At the
end of the year, Dean Atwood left
his post as Dean of Students to
become the Dean of the Commerce
School.

In his first full year as president
of the university, Huntley proposed
at the Opening Day ceremonies this
past fall a program of expansion for
the school. A new library, a new

The IFC has once again been re-
quested to formulate a deferred rush
plan, and is in the process of doing
so. The University Student Center,
opened this year, has its own com-
mittee of students to regulate the
complex according to the wishes ex-
pressed by these students. New
efforts are being made to broaden
the base of the W&L student body,
bringing in students from all walks
and all parts of the country.

The decade, as a whole, is one of
increasing student involvement,
which is reflected accurately in the
manner of writing and the story
content of the Ring-tum Phis from
various years. Where ten years ago
the whole paper was occupied with
comic strips, ads, and reports of
social functions, today’s paper is
likely to be one of a long chain
of symposia on the honor system,
student problems, and changes either
suggested, rejected, finalized, or
under consideration. Where six
years ago it would have been con-
sidered improper to be seen with-
out a coat, tie, and vest on, and an
appearance without a coat and tie
would have been grounds for pro-
bation and a fine, we may be near-
ing the day where the coat and
tie is an anachronism rather than
the rule. Whether or not these
changes were for the best is not
clear: that they were definitely
changes, and that the 60’s saw a
great many of them, will be ap-
parent to anyone who considers the
contrast between 1949 and 1959,
and 1959 and now.

Combined Plan Meeting at Columbia

Representatives from 27 colleges and universities recently attended a two-day meeting at the Columbia School
of Engineering and Applied Science, to discuss the Combined Plan, which enables students to attend W&L for
three years, Columbia for two years of engineering studies, and earn a degree from both. Shown above, from
left, are: Dan Wesley, J. Hennessy, Bryan Baldwin, William Phillips, and Jorge Positigo.

Examination Schedule

January 17, 1970 through January 29, 1970

their current parking places—will

strative officers,

The faculty also
petition requesting that the IFC be
permitted to send a representative
to faculty meetings without vote but
with the privilege of floor discus-
sion.

In recommending rejection of the
request, the faculty Executive Com-
mittee said the student Executive

On the other hand, the faculty
did approve a motion inviting repre-
sentatives of the IFC to appear be-
fore the faculty to make the pre-
sentation on fraternity pledging and
rush. Shortly thereafter, Cahn and
Leonard presented the IFC case to
the faculty.
