gineering and Dr. Duvall will discuss
English. Moger will direct History
and Dr. Spencer will do the same for
Geology.

rectly inside the main door)

The new curriculum has caused
substantial changes to be made in
the requirements for a major in
every department. Different depart-

ments will have different require-
ments for short term work also
The degree requirements and the

short term proposals will be discuss-
ed fully for the first time

 

Andrew Wyndham with a vote of
302 to 251. There will be a run-off
between Bob LaRue and Rob Minor
for Vice-President, Bob Goehring
having been eliminated from the
race.

The floor was also open for nomi-
nations for the other officers of the
IFC. Bill Greenhut was nominated
for Secretary. Andrew Wyndham
and Bob Woodward were nomi-
nated for Senior Justices. Junior
Justice nominees were Kenny Mu-

rov, Tim Chriss, Joe Blake, and
Mack Woodward. The offices of
Treasurer, Rush Chairman, Rush

Book Editor, and Social Chairman
were left without nominees. Nomi-
nations will again be open next
week,

Waugh Crigler, President of the
Senior Class, attended the meeting
to discuss with the IFC the pos-
sibility of having a combo party
sponsored jointly by the IFC and the
Senior Class. The class has planned
a cocktail party for the afternoon of
June 2, and has a surplus of around
$550. Crigler asked the IFC to con-
sider a $35 per house assessment in
order to pay for a combo that night.
Crigler mentioned the possibility of
having the Kalabash Corporation
for the cocktail party and the Em-
bers for the combo.

In the Vice-Presidenial race. La-
Rue had been high man with a total
of 264 votes. Well behind, Minor
polled 176 votes to beat out Goeh-
ring for the other run-off berth.
Goehring received 156 votes.

The final election will be held to-
morrow along with the EC elections
and the Dance Board Vice-Presi-
dency. Only active fraternity mem-
bers will be allowed to vote in the
IFC election, although non-frater-
nity men will be able to vote in all
of the other elections.

Council committee. He has begun
planning next year's program, which
is tentatively set for March 8-12.

The topic for next year’s program
of speeches and panel
will center on “the changing role of
higher education, and Washington
and Lee's place in it,” Cole said

discussions

“The program will be designed so
that Washington and Lee can take
a look at itself,” he added

Cole said the program will deal
with three facets of the topic:

“There will definitely be some
thing on the uniqueness of the small
college and the problems it faces

“There will also be a panel of
speakers who will relate education
to business and government.” They
will deal with such questions as how
education can help business in re
search and what business and gov
ernment want out of the graduating
college student

The final part of the program will

deal with the value of education
Questions that will be considered
here will include “Are we on the

right track in education?” and “Do
people gain more knowledge from
lectures or from an exchange of
ideas?”

REVIEW and OUTLOOK President, Secretary Hopefuls Eye Election

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Wednesday, April 22, 1970

Vote

Considering the issues, the expanded number of positions
to be voted on, and the constitutional amendments, the turn-
out in Monday’s election was a disappointing one. From last
year’s nearly 1100 total ballots, cast at a time when the issues
and candidates weren’t as many, the total fell to 886 on

Monday.

It is unfortunate that the amendments, especially the one
concerning the honor system, drew so few people to the polls.
It is especially distressing since the results of the balloting
may not be from a large enough cross-section to indicate the
extent of any real difference of attitude on any of the matters,
and those votes cannot be resubmitted to the student body in
the general election.

But the election tomorrow will decide student body presi-
dent and secretary and Dance Board and IFC vice-president,
and each of those positions, but particularly the first two, war-
rant the considered vote of a much larger proportion of
W&L’s students than voted in the primary election.

This is the first year Dance Board and IFC officers have
been popularly elected. The rationale was that giving the
elected officers a broader base from which to operate would
vitalize offices that have in recent years suffered from a lack
of creativity. Particularly fraternities, it was felt, would wish to
elect IFC officials directly in order to allow them to speak
with more force in the difficult times nearly all fraternities are
finding themselves in. And we have always heard complaints
that the Dance Board is insensitive to student opinion. It
would seem then that a popular election of the key Dance
Board officer would be the best solution. Thus we are sur-
prised that the turnout was so slight .

Yet probably despair is a better word to describe our re-
action to the fact that even election of student body officers
could not draw more than a meager showing at the polls. The
EC has accomplished a great deal in the last two years. But
many of the programs are yet to be implemented, and cer-
tainly much remains to be done.

Therefore it is imperative that the new student body of.-
ficers be elected by a truly representative and substantial por-
tion of the student body, not merely by those for whom the
polls are convenient. The officers next year will need the legi-
timacy, in their relationship both with the faculty and admini-
stration and with their fellow students, that only a large turn-
out will give them.

R. L. B.

A Striking Omission

The President's latest speech gave most advocates of with-
drawal from Vietnam some reason for optimism despite con-
tinued disagreement over timetables and goals.

His announcement of the withdrawal of another 150,000
troops by next spring, as several have noted, is not really a
radical escalation of the present monthly withdrawal rate but
merely sounds impressive because it is projected over a longer
period. While this is true, one can be modestly encouraged by
Mr. Nixon’s willingness to fix himself to a longer-range time-
table than had previously been deemed advisable to adopt,
even if one remains dissatisfied with the basic approach or rate
of withdrawal.

Probably more distasteful to many was the chauvinistic
appeal with which the President ended his speech. We noticed
the primary reason offered for our continued presence was
the wish to avoid “humiliation and defeat” for the U.S. To
many who still retain the faith that America has been com-
mitted to higher goals, the President's attempt to apologize
for our intervention through an emotional appeal merely to
national pride must have been frustrating.

Yet the most discouraging aspect was not what the Presi-
dent said, but what he did not say. Despite the release of in-
formation about our involvement, apparently increasing, in
Laos, Mr. Nixon avoided the issues of our commitment and
what business we have there.

And if we may dream an all-too-obvious analogy, the
questions to be raised are those many wish they had asked at
the beginning of the Vietnamese conflict. Those questions
deserve an immediate answer.

There is a too-general acceptance of the government's
capacity to shield from the American public, and even from
its elected officials, information it feels the people for their
own good shouldn't know. But that is diametrically opposed
to principles our leaders publicly espouse and a dangerous
course of action in more practical terms. It was just this credi-
bility gap that played a major role in President Johnson's
fall from power, and Mr. Nixon, unless he begins to tell the
entire truth about U.S. involvement in Laos and Cambodia
and to submit that presence to public scrutiny, may fall vic
tim to the same problem

But we are less concerned about Mr. Nixon's political
future than we are about the dangers in conducting foreign
policy by internal machinations of an insensitive bureaucracy.
That OV ernment secrecy m the long run may he a more im
portant issue than the war which presently commands so

i
much of our attention

R.L.

By Steve Ory

Two candidates won election to
office and eight other contestants
made the run-offs in last Monday’s
elections. Phil Thompson, unoppos-
ed candidate for vice president, and
Doug Gossmann, who defeated An-
drew Wyndham for the Interfrater-
nity Council presidency, won their
elections outright.

Fran Lawrence led Joe Tompkins
421 votes to 373 votes in the race
for student body president. Richard
Kampf was eliminated with 51 votes.

Lawrence, a former member of
the EC, ran on a platform emphasiz-
ing a more university-centered com-
munity and liberalized honor sys-
tem reforms. He stated, “The uni-
versity community has not been
completely realized because it has
not been promoted. This year’s Exe-
cutive Committee and the improve-
ment of the university's Own capa-
cities have started the job that must
be continued next year.”

Lawrence said that he felt that
the student body registered discon-
tent with the present honor system
through their electoral support of
the fourth amendment Monday.

The amendment provided for a
one year suspension for honor viola-
tions; and although it failed to get
the necessary student body plurality
for passage, the measure was favor-
ed 461 to 343.

Commenting on the substance of
the honor system revision, Lawrence
said, “We must help the university
realize and appreciate the present
system, yet at the same time empha-
size that the code itself is of lasting
importance, not procedures and
penalties.

“I would encourage a vote on the
penalty revision at the earliest ap-
propriate time next year.”

Joe Tompkins, current student
body vice-president, has set two
priorities in the event of his election
as president of the student body. He
proposed the instigation of a “twen-
ty-five to forty man student senate
to serve in a provisional capacity
which could be made permanent if
the experiment proves satisfactory
next year.”

Tompkins hopes that such an or-
ganization could serve to involve
students in the functions of the stu-
dent government.

The second priority is to “re-evalu-
ate the honor system.” Tompkins
stated that he felt that his role was
to “educate and stimulate students
regarding the honor system and
then let the students decide for
themselves, rather than seek a par-
ticular reform myself.”

“This year,” Tompkins said, “we
passed many beneficial reforms—we
need to preserve these and to seek
others next year.”

Tompkins remarked that he was
disappointed by Monday’s turnout
and he hopes that more people vote
on Thursday.

Bruce Madison and Rich Murray
both received 293 votes in Monday’s
election for secretary of the student
body. Eddie Haslam was eliminated
from the race with 194 votes.

Madison sees the need to evoke
greater student concern as the major
problem facing the school.

He proposes to establish periodic
meetings betewen various groups of
students and representatives to ex-
change ideas: “having 1400 minds
working together rather than

twelve.” Madison has not taken de-
finite stands on particular issues but
would prefer to act in a more rep-
resentative capacity and make deci-
sions regarding coeducation, the
honor system, and other controver-
sial issues after he gains a more
complete perspective of the student
body’s sentiments.

“These problems have deep roots
and they demand more than hasty
personal views.”

As part of his program to gener-
ate greater student involvement,
Madison would try to promote great-
er student inclusion on committees
and university policy decision.

Rich Murray observes that W&L
students have gained much in the
last three years, but he fears that
sudents have become apathetic
about these gains.

This apathy, he maintains, was
evident in the Jack of candidates for
Fancy Dress President and the lack
of competition in the vice presi-
dency race. He fears that such an
attitude could be used as a justifica-
tion to deny future reforms by the

“Watermelon Man”: New

Comedy With Potential

By Cy Dillon

The suburban situation comedy,
whether in motion pictures or tele-
vision, has usually aimed at little
more than mild entertainment, and,
if recent offerings are any indication,
it usually achieves less. Mr. Van
Peebles’ “Watermelon Man” —
though the settings, acting, and
snappy lines would not be out of
place on the Dick Van Dyke tele-
vision show has aims that suggest
more the true potential of comedy.
“Watermelon Man” is able to a-
chieve those aims to a degree that
makes it both entertaining and eye-
opening.

Godfrey Cambridge comes across
well as the victim of a white-black
metamorphosis; he is a good hand
with a good line. The pace keeps the
comedy going, and “Water.
melon Man” from the boredom that
a situation followed through for two

saves

hours has the potential to produce.
The dialogue is smooth and surpris-
ingly funny.

Oddly enough, the
quips are the ones that suggest that
more is going on than the dialogue
can handle. The idea, the situation
behind the lines does not escape the
viewer's mind for a second. The
anomaly of the language —- what ts
being said as opposed to what is

best of the

happening—brings the right amount
of tension into the movie. Attempts
at other styles of language seem

weak.

The plot of “Watermelon Man”
handles the problem of identity in a
way and a style that can reach sub-
urbanites concerned with _ their
neighborhood property values as
well as college students.

If you did not see “Watermelon
Man” during the film symposium, it
is worth planning to watch. It should
be quite popular.

faculty.

Noting several solutions to. stu-
dent apathy, Murray feels that stu-
dent groups should be in closer con-
tact with the EC. He commented
that many organizations have be-
come too autonomous and could be
coordinated with others to promote
more student participation.

On the honor system, Murray
states, “I’m all for giving the guy a
second chance.”

However, he feels that the one
year suspension penalty may not be
the best answer and all alternatives
should be studied thoroughly,

Agreeing with the other candi-
dates, Rich Murray urges everyone
to “get out and vote Thursday.”

Repairs have been recently initiated on the Alexander-Withrow house,
one of the oldest structures remaining in Lexington,

One Of City’s Oldest
Houses Gets New Face

By Monty Cottier

Students on their way to the Col-
lege Inn can hardly have failed to
notice the scaffolding and walkways
around the old building on the cor-
ner housing the Family Shoe Store.
What may not have occurred to
them (those who stopped to worry
about it) is that the building, which
is known officially as the Alexander-
Withrow House and which has been
purchased by the Historic Lexington
Foundation for restoration, is one
of the oldest buildings in Lexing-
ton, having been constructed in
1793.

The property was purchased from
the estates of Misses Margaret and
Lucy Withrow at a cost of around
$18,000, The architectural firm of
Johnson, Craven, and Gibson, which
did restoration work on such sites as
Jefferson's Monticello and Madi-
son's Ashlawn, has been contracted
to work on the Withrow House, un-
der the direction of Mr. Thomas W.
S. Craven

One of the few houses to survive
the fire which almost completely de-
stroyed Lexington in 1796, the Alex-
ander-Withrow House, originally «
two-storied structure, had the bot-
tom store level added when the
streets in the Main and Washington
streets areas were lowered in 1850.
This was done by adding cut stone
underpinning and a back wall, which
is the side wall for the gift shop
adjoining the house.

The first stage of repairs, currently
underway, consists of work on the
roof of the house, the exterior brick-

Re: Books...

  

By Betty Munger

Manager of the W&L Bookstore

It is certainly tempting to air
One’s Opinions when one has access
to public print. So this week I in-
tend to yield to such a temptation
on the subject of the current en-
thusiasm for pollution problems.

One thing that bothers me is the
“bandwagon” aspect of the survival
cause. To quote Robert Heilbroner
in the April 23rd issue of the “New
York Review of Books”: “In short,
the ecological issue has assumed the
dimensions of a vast popular fad,
for which one can predict with rea-
sonable assurance the trajectory of
all such fads — a period of intense
general involvement, followed by
growing boredom and gradual ex-
tinction, save for a die-hard remnant
of the faithful.” It is going to be all
too easy to soothe our consciences
with some mornings’ hard work on
the litter around our community.

Such tokenism can have little
role in the mounting crisis of the
ecological balance on the “Space-
ship Earth”. We must be prepared
to give far more time, money, and
above all, conviction for the wide-
spread, long-range planning and

work (which has been noted in num- changes in our very way of life.

erous architectural publications be-
cause of the unusual latticework
construction), and the woodwork.
Money for the project was ob-
tained, in large part, by holding
tours of the various historical sites
in and around Lexington, such as
Dean Light’s home, where Lee lived
until 1868, Hickory Hill, where
Cyrus McCormick's nephew lived,
and Stone Houses which was built
in 1793 and is now owned by Mr.
and Mrs. Matthew Paxton, Jr.

According to Mrs. Marguerite
Old, publicity director for the His-
toric Lexington Foundation, the
group intends to finish the three-
stage restoration plan on the With-
row House and then move to other
historic buildings in the Lexington
area. Among those listed on the Ad-
visory Board for the foundation are
former governor of Texas, Price
Daniel, Fowler McCormick of Chic-
ago, and Senator Willis Robertson.

The evidence is increasingly clear.
The impetus for these changes will
have to come through major shifts
in our cultural values and life-styles.
Survival will call for a conservation-
ist economy. Business interests will
have to become subordinate to eco-
logical necessities. Education, in-
cluding especially the mass media,
must be responsive to, and respon-
sible to, the environmental impera-
tive. Material possessions in our
highly developed society must be-
come secondary to the simple needs
for food, water and air.

To quote Dr. Heilbroner again:
“Can we really persuade the Wes-
tern world, who are just now enter-
ing the heady atmosphere of a high
consumption way of life, that con-
servation, stability, frugality, and a
deep concern for the distant future
must now take priority over the
personal indulgence for which they
have been culturally prepared and

“Mitchell Should Go’

 

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

After the Supreme Court nomina-
tion of G. Harrold Carswell was
rejected by the Senate, one nation-
ally syndicated columnist blamed
the Administration’s defeat on At-
torney General John Mitchell, say-
ing “The Attorney General has been
pitching like Charlie Brown and his
wife has been fielding like Snoopy.
They should both be traded to Mil-
waukee for some bullpen help. The
President needs relief.”

James Reston? Tom Wicker? or
some other outraged liberal? No,
this was written by James J. Kil-
patrick, the ultra-conservative col-
umnist for the Washington Star. The
fact is almost everybody, liberals
and conservatives, would like to see
Nixon replace his Attorney General.
Liberals do not like Mitchell’s law
and order politics, and conservatives

blame him for Administration de-
feats.
Time and Newsweek both ran

cover stories on the Carswell defeat,
laying most of the blame on Mit-
chell, and Life, a magazine that sup-
ported Nixon’s candidacy two years
ago, printed an editorial entitled
“Mitchell Should Go.”

As the strong man in the Cabinet,
Mitchell has become the President's
chief advisor in domestic affairs,
and his advice has been almost uni-
versally bad. With all the qualified
judges to choose from, Mitchell re-
commended Carswell, hardly a
choice to inspire confidence in the
Attorney General. Even Kilpatrick,
a Carswell supporter, said “our man,
to put it bluntly, was simply not all
that hot.”

In fact, both rejected Supreme
Court nominees, Carswell and Cle-
ment Haynesworth, were recom-
mended to Nixon by Mitchell, a less
than encouraging track record for
the Attorney General. Time says
“The President could have come up
with acceptable nominees if he had
not relied so completely upon —
and been served so poorly by —
Mitchell.”

The real problem with Mitchell
is that he does not understand the
game of politics as it is played in
Washington, D.C. By necessity,
Cabinet members must retain close

tion to protect against a pending re-
volt from the Reagan-right. The
plan was that each state chairman
would be told that whenever Gen-
eral Eisenhower's name was men-
tioned, all the delegates were to go
scream bloody murder in honor of
our then-ill ex-president. Unbe-
knownst to anyone outside of this
clandestine meeting, the chairman
of the rules committee would work
Eisenhower’s name into his report
to the convention, at which point
the delegates would go bananas, the
rules chairman would mumble the
remainder of his report, including
the rule change, into the micro-
phone, Saunders would get up, call
for the yeas and nays, and the rule
would pass before anybody could
blink.

All of the above was reported by
Horowitz, and all of it was true. A
low-down, sneaky, brilliant plan, if
I say so myself, and I do, since it
was my idea, as chairman of the
Rules Committee.

Now for Horowitz's omissions.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Does GM |
About Cleaner ‘Air?

 

 

You bet we do! General Motors has made a public pledge
to solve the problem of vehicle emissions in the shortest
possible time. We’re working in two directions to accom-
plish this objective: finding new ways to further reduce
pollutants from our current engines and exploring, through
aggressive research programs, new low-pollutant power
sources.

GM BEGAN EMISSION CONTROL k
RESEARCH 20 YEARS AGO

It was some twenty years ago that GM initiated its first
research into the control of vehicle emissions. The imme-
diate problem was air pollution in the Los Angeles basin.
At that time, air chemistry and the reaction of vehicle
emissions in the air was a little-known field. Even today,
scientists are only beginning to unravel this immensely com-
plex subject.

WHERE THE EMISSIONS COME FROM

While it was known that trace amounts of the hydrocarbons
which make up gasoline are not burned in the combustion
process, it was generally thought that these unburned
hydrocarbons were emitted only through the exhaust sys-
tem. GM scientists learned that only 60% of a vehicle’s
unburned hydrocarbons were emitted through the exhaust
system—20% escaped through the crankcase vent and
20% through evaporation of gasoline vapors from the
fuel tank and carburetor.

EMISSIONS FROM A CAR WITHOUT CONTROLS

The major emissions from a car without controls are un-
burned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of
nitrogen. Of these, the unburned hydrocarbons were rec-
ognized by GM and government scientists as being the
major contributors to Los Angeles-type smog and were
selected for emphasis in control. As in most technical ad-
vances, progress in controlling these emissions was made
in a series of steps, not in a single dramatic leap.

ae

CLOSING OFF THE CRANKCASE VENT

The first step was the development of the Positive Crank-
case Ventilation (PCV) system. This system, which was
installed in all cars sold in California beginning with the
1961 model (1963 model, nationwide), substantially elim-
inated the 20% of pollutants being emitted through the
crankcase vent. This was done voluntarily prior to the
existence of government standards.

EXHAUST CONTROL MEASURES

Next, systems were developed to control exhaust emissions.
Exhaust control systems were installed on most 1966 GM
cars produced for sale in California (all 1968 models, nation-
wide). These systems, along with the PCV control which
previously had been made standard equipment, decreased
the emissions of hydrocarbons by about 60% from the
level emitted by an uncontrolled car.

CONTROLLING EVAPORATIVE EMISSIONS

Evaporative emissions from the fuel tank and the carbu-
retor were the last of the three sources to be controlled.
All 1970-model GM cars produced for sale in California
have these controls. Beginning with 1971 models, GM will
include evaporative controls on its production nationwide.

WHERE DOES GM STAND?

artification tests, required by the State of California prior
to production, showed that GM 1970 model cars, as

pped for California use, achieved reductions of more
thar, 80% on hydrocarbon emissions and reductions of
more than 65% on carbon monoxide emissions compared
with 1960 cars withou! controls.

 

   

 

Care,

We think this is good progress toward our goal of a vir-
tually pollutant-free car. While the goal is now in sight,
the last mile will be the toughest part of the fight.

WHAT GM IS DOING

As we said, we're pursuing two roads toward our objective
of cleaner air: better controls for the present engines and
new power sources.

Our research on the current engine is looking into the
possible modification of engine design, improved control
systems and possibly fuel injection for more precise air-
fuel ratios. This research also shows that the use of unleaded
fuel would make possible advanced emission-control systems.
After the results of this research were discussed individually
with different petroleum companies, a number of these com-
panies announced that they would soon offer an unleaded
gasoline. With the availability of unleaded gasoline, long-
life exhaust catalytic converters, exhaust manifold reactors
and exhaust gas recirculation systems could become tech-

nically feasible.

We are also continuing to investigate alternative power
sources aggressively and completely. We are not committed
to the internal combustion engine and are investigating these
power sources with an open mind. Steam, electric, Stirling,
hybrid and gas turbine engines are being vigorously studied
in the largest research program of its type in the world. We
will have no hesitation in using a practical low-pollutant
alternative to the internal combustion engine.

WHAT CAN THE CAR OWNER DO?

Car owners can actively join in the battle for cleaner air.

First, keep your car in efficient operating condition through
proper maintenance. Studies have shown that proper engine
maintenance can substantially lower a vehicle’s emissions.
You should do this anyway to keep your operating costs
down and to make sure you are driving a safe car.

Second, GM dealers will soon be offering a low-cost emis-
sion-control system to be installed on 1967 models or
older (1965 or older in California). The system will in-
clude an ignition control device and call for an engine
tune-up to manufacturer's recommendations. Emissions
are reduced up to 50%. The system will be available in
California when certified by the California Air Resources
Board and nationally, as soon as possible thereafter. Have
it installed when it becomes available.

AT GENERAL MOTORS WE HAVE
ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE

Our society is rightly placing increased emphasis on the
necessity for clean air. At General Motors we have ao
cepted this challenge. Over the years we have made &
substantial commitment in people, facilities and funds in
order to solve our part of the air pollution problem. We will
continue this effort until this goal is reached.

A GLOSSARY OF POLLUTION TERMS |

Hydrocarbons: Compounds of hydrogen and carbon, Gaso-
line is made up of many different hydrocarbons, Both evapo |
rative losses and exhaust emissions contain a variety of
hydrocarbons. When baked by the sun they react photo
chemically with other gases to form

Carbon monoxide: A colorless, odorless, tasteless gas result
ing from the combustion of carbon with insufficient air.
Oxides of nitrogen: A natural by-product of combustion,
Lead: An additive used in gasoline to reduce engine spurk
knock. A principal fault is that it fouls pollution control
devices.

to Babe Ruth, were still in Babe
Ruth League when you were dropp-
ed from American Legion ball and
so on. But I guess I had my chance.
I had a headstart on these two guys
and blew it. After all I was already
sitting up when they still had two
months to go.

No doubt, the biggest shock of all
though, came when I was looking
through the names of the coaches
and managers for the current sea-
son. Of course there were the Gil
Hodges, the Yogi Berras, and the
Red Schoendiensts, but everybody
knew them when they were in their
prime. So big deal. But, my God,
what’s Joe Pignatano, Jim Busby
Ozzie Virgil, Mike ‘Roarke, and
Rocky Bridges doing on the list of
coaches.

I mean, it wasn't so very long
ago that I was furious because I had
doubles of Jim Busby, and triples
of Joe Pignatano, trying desperately
to trade away the extra cards. But
there wasn't ever much of a market
for Pignatanos and Busbys. Now
they're all coaches or managers,
automatically acquiring some sort of
distinction as an aged mentor. And
I, because I once watched these
“old” men when they were players,
have to feel just a wee bit older.
It's all part of growing up, I guess,
facing the draft graduating
from college reading about
Rocky Bridges’ retirement and all
that, but I could swear it was only
yesterday that I tried to smeak a
Roy McMillan past for a Wally
Moon. Maybe I should try again,
for they're really running the base
paths now.

Lacrosse Team 5-1;
Roanoke Clobbered

They said it couldn't be done.
Washington and Lee could never
beat a team from the top lacrosse
division in the nation, the Middle
Eastern Division. Last Saturday,
though, the Generals did just that
when they defeated the University
of Baltimore by a score of 10-7.

Jim McCane scored the first goal
of the game. After the first quarter
W&L had three goals while blank-
ing Baltimore. By the half, the Gen-
erals had a 5-1 margin. The third
quarter was a good one for Balti-
more, however. They permitted
W&L only one goal while they took
four, making the score 6-5 in the
favor of the Blue. Hopes for a Balti-
more victory faded in the fourth
quarter when the Generals got four
goals and kept the Baltimore team
down to two.

This win heightens the Generals’
prestige and will make other teams
recognize Washington and Lee’s la-
crosse renaissance. Not once in the
entire game did the Generals trail.

Yesterday, Roanoke College ven-
tured into Lexington to take on the
Generals, Sam Englehart, assisted
by Bob Brumback, scored the first

goal, After only six minutes of play,
the Big Blue had accumulated some
five goals. By the end of the quarter
the margin was upped to 9-1, Of
the Generals’ first nine goals, Engle-
hart had scored 5, Whit Morrill had
2 and McCane and Meriwether had
bagged one apiece.

Within the second quarter, Hank
Slauson added two more goals, La-
motte came up with one and Groton
threw in another. Groton scored
two more goals in the third quarter,
while Ed Tognetti and Winfield got
one apiece. Going into the fourth
quarter, the score was up to 17-2.
The last quarter made the final tally
20-5. Of our three goals in the
fourth quarter, John Rogers, a de-
fenseman, nabbed two with Mark
Skoggard making the other one.

So far, W&L’s record is five and
one, with wins against Geneseo
State, Villanova, Duke, Baltimore

and Roanoke. The lone upset came
at the hands of Towson State. The
Generals have played tough schools
and fared quite well against them.
Take the Duke game for example.

added a third insurance run in the
eighth, scoring on singles by Danny
Pond and Chris Zeno and a pinch-
double by Tom Hoy.

Although Rose kept the Generals’
batters off balance with a slider and
excellent control, and crafty off-
speed hurling, the right hander was
helped several times by his team-
mate's defensive efforts. The Tigers
put down an eighth inning rally at-
tempt which had resulted from Steve
Kalista’s single and Brad Hall's
fielder’s choice. Rob LaRue then
lined a single to left field, but Kal-
ista was nailed at the plate trying
to score from second and Hall was
thrown out trying to reach third,
thus completing a double play

Once again Coach Lyles pulled all
the stops in an attempt to grab a
victory, using five pitchers. Bill
Greener, starting for W&L, was
charged with the loss. He was fol
lowed by King, in the fourth, Tim
Haley in the seventh, Bill Miller in

and amicable relations with Con-
gress if they are to be effective. Mit-
chell’s attempts at strong arm poli-
tics have alienated many Senators,
especially liberal Republicans. With

only 43 Republicans in the Senate,

the President needs almost unani-
mous support from his party in im-
portant votes, It was the defection
of 17 Republicans on the Haynes-
worth vote and 13 on the Carswell
vote that really doomed the nomi-
nees. How many of these votes
would have remained with the Presi.
dent if Mitchell had retained amic-
able relations with the Senate? It’s
impossible to say, but Newsweek
quotes one Senate Republican as
saying “John Mitchell is a disaster
for the Administration — an unmiti-
gated disaster.”

With unemployment up, the war
and recession continuing, and school
desegration reaching a crisis point,
President Nixon will need all the
friends in Congress he can muster,
and that means a different Attorney
General. As Life says, “Mitchell
Should Go.”

scored the first goal of the period,

it up again, The tide was turned

a one goal advantage. But the Blue

in a short while, Scott Neese notch-

shooting a goal at 6:40. For the rest
of the game W&L played possession
ball, preventing Duke from making
another goal while Sam Englehart
got two more, making the final
score: W&L 8 and Duke §.

Why have the Generals had so
much success? One important fac-
tor is their strong offensive punch,
as shown in the game with Duke,
Baltimore and Roanoke. Another
factor could be their hard running
midfield. The defense must not be
overlooked, for it, too, has done a
creditable job. In the Duke game,
on extra-man plays, Washington and
Lee prevented Duke from getting a
single goal. And then there is one
man who cannot go without notice.
He is goalie Bill Ingersoll. His per-
formance against Duke, Baltimore
and Roanoke clearly shows his im-
portance to the team. Against Duke
he had 13 saves,

The season is far from over. This
Saturday the Generals go against
Washington College at Lexington
at 2 p.m. Spectator support would
be appreciated, This divisional game
will not be an easy one, for Wash-
ington’s only two losses have been to
John Hopkins and UNC,

By the way, any lacrosse fans in
terested can buy tickets for the
North-South all-star game on June
13 from the Lexington Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce. Tickets will be
on sale when we play UNC,

Lee Society
Meet at W&L

The Society of the Lees of Vir-
ginia will meet this weekend in
Lexington, where Gen. Robert E.
Lee spent the last five years of his
life.

The society, whose members are
descendents of Richard Lee the
Emigrant, who arrived in James-
town in 1639, will convene at Wash-

ington and Lee Saturday for its
annual meeting.
Saturday's events will center

around Washington and Lee. Gen.
Lee became president of the institu-
tion not long after Appomattox.

The annual meeting at 10 a.m.
will be held in Lee Chapel, where
the general is buried. Mrs. William
R. Stubbs, a hostess at the Chapel,
will address the society.

Free Exam Plan

(Continued from Page 1)
mously adopted the so-called “mi-
nority” proposal from the faculty.
This proposal establishes freedom as
to what day a student may take this
exams. However, the student must
decide and announce in advance
when he will take his exams,

During the discussion of this pro-
posal Dean Kumpuris claimed that
he felt sealed exams could be dis-
tributed before the assigned exami-
nation period. When the bell sound-
ed, students could break open their
exams and begin work. This method
would eliminate congestion at the
beginning and terminating bells of
each exam period.

Earth Day Talk Tonight
(Continued from Page 1)

The final speaker of the afternoon
was Mr. Bernard Cohen, legal coun
sel active in the field of resource
and pollution law. He discussed the
legal aspects of the pollution prob-
lem: the present regulations cover
ing the discharge of pollutants, the
prosecution of offenders, and the
laws needed in the future to guar
antee a balanced environment.

polling of delegations. The goal of
the Mock Convention has been, and
should remain, accuracy. If the dele-
gates were polled on the first ballot
of the presidential nomination, the
concept of accuracy would go out
the window. This is a Mock Con-
vention. But the leaders of the Rea-
gan campaign would not accept this.
They chose to ignore the fact that
this was an educational experience,
a good time, and a Mock conven-
tion. So they decided to sabotage the
entire Operation by insisting that
each delegation be polled. Hence
top secret plan.

2. The plan didn’t work. Saund-
ers wouldn't go through with it.
Saunders believed that my plan was
unethical (which it most certainly
was), and in spite of the fact that it
might kill the whole goal of the con-
vention, Saunders explained the de-
sired rule change to the delegates
The delegates voted by voice vote,
and the new rule was declared in
force, in spite of the Reagan forces
I have since seen the light, and
abhor what I did.

Which brings me to the point of
this epistle. There was an individual,
namely Steve Saunders, who refused
to let this convention be fixed (above
and beyond the inherent fix of a
nominating convention).

Horowitz is correct in asserting
that the United States government
is a “fix.” It does disregard the
rights and desires of its citizens. To
carry the argument even further,
there is present a latent form of fas
cism or elitism throughout the poli
tical spectrum, which includes

Nixon's alleged
silent majority.
But unlike Horowitz, I'm willing
to give it all, once more, one more
chance (tautology intended). I am
still convinced that there must be
individuals around who will rise
to “power” without squashing mil-
lions of heads on the way up, and
who will not have to keep the rest
in chains in order to remain “up.” If
I ever do lose this faith, and the
possibility certainly exists, then
there will be one more guy helping
to man the barricades.
