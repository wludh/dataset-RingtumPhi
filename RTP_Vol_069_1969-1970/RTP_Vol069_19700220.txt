City Counci

lto Consider

Property Tax on Students

Students living in Lexington dur-
ing the nine-month school session
may soon be required to pay a cily
tax on personal property.

Lexington Commissioner of Reve-
nue I. C. Baker has been studying
the possibility of such a tax for nine
months. He has prepared a report
for submission to City Council at a
later date.

City Council has not yet received
or discussed the report.

rhe study considers the possibility
of assessing the personal property of
students living in Lexington. It also

considers requiring city license tags
on students’ cars.

It deals with the revenue expected
and the legality of such a move.

The study was begun last year
after Virginia Attorney General
Robert Y. Button ruled that stu-
dents living in Virginia cities during
the regular nine-month school ses-
sion may be legally taxed by those
cities,

If passed by City Council, the or-
dinance would probably require stu-
dents to buy city license tags or to
pay a flat fee for tangible personal
property, Baker said.

Some students are already being
assessed by the city—among them
students who have registered to vote
in Lexingion or who are employed
in the city. They are required to pay
a nominal personal property tax,
Baker said.

Baker said the city government
needs more revenue, and students
are the logical answer to the prob-
lem. He pointed out that one-third
of the city’s land is owned by Wash-
ington and Lee and Virginia Mili-
tary Institute, which are tax-exempt.

He also noted that students drive
on city streets more than local resi-
dents, use most of the parking
spaces, and require use of the police
department and other city services,

The position of the council
year, and remains this year, is that
no definite action will be taken
without adequate solicitation of stu-
dent opinion. The council is plan-
ning, when the measure is brought
up, to invite representatives from
the Washington and Lee and Vir-
ginia Military Institute student gov-
ernments to sit in on the meeting
and offer their opinions.

The Ring-tum Phi An Evaluation of the EC Report

Friday

Anachronism Challenged

The faculty is soon to be confronted with the most seri-
ous threat to the in loco parentis approach to student affairs
to be posed in some years. It comes in the form of the Stu-
dent Body Executive Committee report on “Student Af-
fairs and Faculty Regulations” and is in our judgment a
significant departure from the past in more ways than the
possibility for meaningful action it will afford student organi-
zations, which the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi noted.

It is difficult for us to understand why the faculty or ad-
ministration should seek to concern itself with the private
lives of its students. Henry Steele Commager, in the most
recent issue of the Saturday Review (‘‘Has the Small College
a Future?”), traces the source of the in loco parentis struc-
ture to the time when the American college served basically as
a prep school and was therefore expected not only to instill
fundamental knowledge but to inculcate and enforce moral
precepts as well.

But that certainly does not explain its present function
nor why schools are so reluctant to alter their rules as a re-
sponse to the changed nature of the students they must deal
with. The only explanation we can offer is that a basic lack
of respect for student maturity underlies present thinking on
the matter.

It seems to us that the suggested rule emendations follow
two basic directions. On the one hand, the faculty is advised
to dissociate itself from matters of private concern, and on the
other, it is enjoined to allow student representatives a
greater voice in the governing of the University on matters
that concern them.

The infeasibility of enforcing a particular moral code on
a student body as decentralized as W&L’s is can be readily
demonstrated. More important, of course, is the larger ques-
tion of enforcing any moral code which does not deal directly
with the maintenance of the community and which does not
contribute to the ends it seeks. The advisability of allowing
students a larger voice in the managing of the University’s
affairs is equally apparent if one is to note the result of stu-
dent exclusion from the locus of power in other schools. In
this area the EC’s demands show a reasonableness and self-
determination remarkable for a body that is nearly as con-
strained and excluded as the student body it represents.

Neither aspect of this effort is in our view unreasonable
in principle and its formulation in the report is a sensible and
progressive, in some cases almost cautious, response to the
present situation. And we consider its acceptance, at least
regarding major points, vital to the atmosphere of mutual
respect with which any serious institution of higher learning
should proceed.

The Wrong Problem

The removal of the sanction of an Executive Committee
student body assessment from CONTACT seriously, and un-
necessarily, jeopardizes the existence of that program. While
Student Body President Swede Henberg has a point in with-
holding the assessment, we wonder whether he hasn’t acted
rashly in so endangering that week of speeches and seminars.

Henberg correctly observed that the position of CON.
TACT chairman is selected by the Interfraternity Council,
which contributes a major portion of the funds for CON.
TACT and which conceived of the idea. Such a selection, it is
true, virtually excludes the possibility of a non-fraternity
chairman.

Yet, after all, no matter who gets the prestige, the entire
academic community profits in a program that is one of the
most significant activities students execute. As a matter of
fact, it seems at least as inequitable that fraternity men pay
the IFC assessment as well as the student body assessment tor
roughly the same privileges as every body else. It strikes us a5
odd that Henberg should choose to focus on who is allowed
the prestige rather than on who benefits as a means to dex ide
upon whom the cost should fall

There are rumors that a compromise solution is to be
offered, and because the problem Henberg motes is a real

By Monty Cottier

The report on Student Affairs and
Faculty Regulations, prepared by
an EC subcommittee consisting of
Swede Henberg, Dave Bethea, Bill
Andrews and Glenn Azuma, has
been turned over to the Student Af-
fairs Committee of the faculty. The
report was prepared without faculty
foreknowledge, and is being pre-
sented as the work and wishes of
the EC alone. Never secretive, Hen-
berg has shown a willingness to dis-
cuss the proposals of the report, but
he declined to speculate on the re-
actions of the faculty to it, saying,
“IT have learned never to anticipate
the actions of the faculty.”

A statement from the introduc-
tion should serve to give an idea
of the basic purpose of the pro-

posals outlined in the report. Speak-
ing of the right of the faculty to reg-
ulate student affairs, the authors,
while recognizing this right, go on
to state, “we do, however, question
whether for the sake of the com-
munity as a whole the concept of
in loco parentis remains viable and
healthy.” They continue with the
opinion that “many current regula-
tions are impositions on students
and faculty alike.”

Admitting the injustice of allow-
ing students to control matters which
would by their nature extend longer
than the student’s ordinary four-
year tenure (meaning questions in-
volving the academics and admini-
stration of the school itself), the
committee addressed its attention
for the most part to the question of
regulations governing social func-
tions. They asked for students to be
represented on faculty committees
(such as the Admissions Committee,

the Courses and Degrees Commit-
tee, the Lectures Committee, and
the Student Affairs Committee)

where they are either not now rep-
resented, or have no vote, and in the
latter case to give them a vote on
matters pertaining to student mat
ters.

Professor Riegel (right) confers with director Philippe Labro (left) and French Film star Jean-Claude Bouillon
Labro’s film “Tout Peut Arriver” in Lexington,

As regards the decisions of the
committees as a whole, the sugges-
tion was made that these decisions
be posted on the ODK board, so
that the students as well as the
teachers might have an idea of how
events stood.

Admissions, Courses and Degrees,
Lectures, and, in a rather different
manner, Student Affairs and faculty
EC, were all handled in much the
same manner: by suggesting that a
student be placed on the committee.
Of course, this is not equally true
for all of them: for instance, a stu-
dent is already allowed on both Lec-
tures and the faculty EC, but in the

first case all memory of this privi
lege had been lost, and in the sec
ond, he has no vote. (A voting mem-
bership is one of the prime requests
of the report). The Student Affairs
Committee came in for a great deal
of attention as regards the regula-
tion of the students’ social life. Of
course, since the students would be
allowed to vote only on matters di-
rectly concerning student affairs, the
chairmen of these committees would
be the ones to determine just what
constituted such matters.

In the area of social life men
tioned earlier, the report favors the
abolition of the sections of the Fac

 

 

Letters To The Editor...

 

 

Editor, Ring-tum Phi:

I found Lawrence McConnell’s
review Of Ramsey Clark’s speech
here such a web of miscomprehen-
sion and dangerous cliche that it
demands a reply.

Clark’s stated purpose was to turn
our attention away from high-
sounding phrases about law and
order, however edifying, to a com-
prehension of the social conditions
that breed lawlessness. Unless we
thus shift our focus, we shall have
neither law nor order, much less
justice.

McConnell never touches the
point. Instead he draws a distinc-
tion between respect for and obedi
ence of the law: while he agrees with
Clark that the former is too much
to expect of the slum dweller, he
accuses him of disfavoring support
for the latter. The embedded infer-
ence is fallacious, of course, and the
assertion that Clark is soft on en-
forcement all the more surprising
in view of his repeated assertion
that the laws we have must be en-
forced even when questionable or
unjust. (Cf. his comments on the
“Boston Five”.)

So the main point was missed,
but in the course of his incompre
hension McConnell makes several
ancillary mistakes, a couple of
which are worth clearing up. For
example, he sees a contradiction be-
tween Lincoln’s view that the law
must be worshipped with zeal bor-
dering on the religious and our pres-
ent view that laws change with soc-
ial conditions. There is no contra-
diction, here, unless McConnell
strangely opposes the distinction be-
tween law generically understood
and particular instantiations of it,
i.e., particular laws, He also sees a
contradiction between the democra
tic principle of equality before the
law and the recognition that the
law has different effects in different
social conditions . . . but again he’s
wrong. This is not a contradiction,
but the juxtaposition of a statement
of fact and a statement of hope:
we all, (Clark, McConnell, me) wish
for equality before the law. The fact
is that we don’t have it. Further, it
simply not follow that such
equality must await the homogeniza
tion of social conditions, nor, of

ties

The question of absence policies
was dealt with by requesting un
limited cuts for all but freshmen,

pointing out that the current practice
of allowing unlimited absences to
persons on the Dean’s List puts cuts
in the position of privileges awarded

to the persistent few. Tied in with
this is the subcommittee’s reccom
mendations on the matter of the

limitation of activities for students
on academic probation. The report
suggested that such students be al
lowed one activity other than those
specified under rule nine of Student
Activities, pointing out that few, if
any, students do poorly because
they overextended themselves. The
report finished with a recommenda-
tion in this same vein, stating that
instead of the current requirement
of a 2.00 cumulative and a 2.00 on
the previous semester both being re
quired for activities, the rule should
simply hold for a 2.00 cumulative
grade,

What exactly do these proposals
mean? As far as I can tell, they are
important much for what
they say themselves (although this
is certainly a vital part of it) as for
what they imply. Naturally, they
contain long-needed reforms and
changes, and these changes, if in
stituted, will do a great deal towards
loosening the restrictions on the stu
dents. However, the idea of remov
ing the university's role of acting
in loco parentis has a great many
more logical extensions than the re

Swim Team at State Meet

Today, the Generals are entering
their second day of competition in
the Virginia State Swimming Cham-
pionships held at William and Mary.
There are eight teams participating
in the second state-wide meet to be
held. The defending champions, the
University of Virginia, did not al-
tend the meet. Their chances of de-
feating the favored William and
Mary were negligible, so they have
stayed home to tune up for their
upcoming conference championship.

Coach Stearns, too, is preparing
his swimmers for the C.A.C,. cham-

the Generals to capture a second in

Stearns mentioned that the William
and Mary team appears to be the
strongest team ever assembled in
Virginia’s immediate history.
Looking back at his team’s 5-2
season record, Coach Stearn’s ex-
pressed satisfaction with the results,
Two of the meets—Catholic and Old
Dominion—were hard fought meets
in which the Blue natators perform-
ed well. The outstanding performers
this year have been All-America
Bill Brumback, freshman Alan Cor-
with, and Bim Clark. Brumback has
already qualified to participate in
the national swimming champion-
ships again this year. Both Corwith
and Clark have come very close to
qualifying while setting school and
C.A.C, conference records in theit
events. Clark won last year’s most

seasons. Their overall record is 71-
23, with seasons of 20-5, 19-6, 19-5

team for much of their collegiate
careers, Cartwright is the leading
scorer with an 18.3 average. Neer
is among the nation’s leading re-
bounders with 16.7 a game while
scoring at a 17.1 clip. Morrison is
averaging 6.5 points a game and

Despite an 0-8 record going into
the tournament, the team is look-
ing forward to the tournament, ac-
cording to Coach Miller. “The qual-
ity of wrestling in our area is much
better than most of the other
schools. Our competition has prob-
ably been better throughout the
season,” he said.

When asked to choose a favorite,
Coach Miller replied, “Based on
past performances and our record,
I'd have to make Sewanee the fav-
orite.”

An Evaluation Of The EC Report

port itself mentions.

Of course, the report itself is
merely a logical extension of the
various rules and regulations re-

cently adopted by the faculty, such
as the parietals, liquor in the dorms,
cars for freshmen, and so on, which
in their turn were complements of
the decisions to remove the enforce-
ment of conventional dress.

As far as these concrete proposals
go, they will have the effect of lib-
eralizing the restrictions under
which the student must currently
operate. The faculty will realize that
the University no longer serves as
both a home and school for pubes-
cent boys, and that men attend col-
lege today at an age when, in years
past, they would have been married
and working for several years. Fur-
ther, these changes will, as most

An Answer to McConnell

(Continued from Page 2)

course, did Clark say or imply any-
thing like this. But things get worse.

The most astounding bit of ab-
surdity in the entire article comes
when McConnell ventures into the
field of social theory. What is one
to do with the statement that, “The
individual liberty upon which this
country was founded inherently and
necessarily breeds (sic) the inner
(sic) quality of one’s economic con-
dition”. Where does one begin?
Presumably, McConnell doesn't
blame Harlem on the Bill of Rights,
so he must mean that our Adam
Smith capitalism is responsible for
the slums and poverty in America.
Suppose this were true: then we
should have sufficient reason to give
up capitalism. (It is not self-evident,
as McConnell seems to assert that
the liberty essential to a liberal de-
mocracy depends on a free market-
place.) But, of course, it is not true,
because (a) we do not, nor have we
ever had, an Adam Smith capitalism,
(has McConnell never taken econo-
mics?) and (b) because the slums
we have cannot be accounted for
simply in terms of economics, (has
McConnell never heard of slavery?)

Finally, McConnell treats us to a
cliche, (“some injustice will always
exist”), a half-truth hovering be-
tween metaphysics and pragmatics
As a metaphysical statement, it is
probably true, but since Clark's, my,
and presumably MecConnell's con-
cerns are not cosmic but specific, he
surely doesn't so intend it in this
context. Instead, it has the same
effect here that, e.g., the response,
“Boys will be boys” has in the face
of My Lai, or the response “The
poor have ye always with ye” in the

changes do, become less and less
startling and radical with each year,
until people will begin wondering,
as they do now about some of the
regulations during President Lee's
administration, how intelligent peo-
ple could enforce such prohibitions.
Today, Washington and Lee is
not the bastion of conservatively
dressed, convention (and regulation)-
conscious men it Once was, but, on
the other hand, men don’t rise when
a professor enters the lecture room
and remain standing until he tells
them to be seated (as they once did).
Times change, and in this era of in-
volvement and the mutual exchange
of ideas (rather than the deliverance
unto the classes of Lectures from
the Hill) as the basis of education,
the concept of in loco parentis will
go the way of mortarboards and
gowns as daily apparel and Greek
and Latin as mandatory studies.
