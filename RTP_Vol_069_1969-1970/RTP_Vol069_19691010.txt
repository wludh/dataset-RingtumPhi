Non-Partisan Moratorium
cheduled For University

Plans for Washington and Lee's
observance of the nationwide mora-
torium on the Vietnam War on Oc-
tober 15 crystallized during the past
week.

A group of concerned residents
of the Lexington community met
last Sunday in Lee Chapel to share
views on the moratorium. A clear-
cut program for the observance now
appears to be taking shape.

Prof. David Zucker, the group's
publicity chairman said the group's
activities on Wednesday will not
constitute protest against the war,
but rather a moratorium designed

to direct student and community
thought toward it.
Zucker emphasized that faculty

members have the option of dismiss-
ing their classes on October 15.

Colleges

Colleges throughout Virginia have
joined the proposed Vietnam mora-
torium scheduled for October 15,
Virtually all the colleges are stress-
ing the importance of individual
thought and participation, rather
than a definite pro-or anti-war stand,

At Hollins, a faculty vote left
cancellation of classes to the discre-
tion of individual teachers, Students
are free to attend classes if they so
desire.

Roanoke College, which operates
under a free-cut system, will also
hold classes on October 15. The
Roanoke Times quoted the college's
president, Dr. Perry Kendig, as
praising a proposed day-long discus-
sion program and as discouraging
the scheduling of tests on the 15th.

The University Council of Vir-
ginia Tech formally recognized the
event but classes will be held as
usual. The council stressed that hin
drances should not be provided for
those who wished to participate

Meanwhile, Tech students are be-
in connection with the moratorium
ginning a week-long series of events,

Faculty student discussion sessions
began yesterday and will continue
through next Tuesday

Plans for the ISth at Tech now

include a mock funeral and reading
of war dead and an afternoon
teach-in. Professor Tom Travis told
the Roanoke Times that the mora
torium group is seeking the school’s
drill field for the teach-in. Folk
singers, rock and roll bands and
speakers are scheduled for the after
noon ceremony, Workshops may be
held in the evening,

The Times quoted Travis, as say
ing his group is working with the
National Vietnam Moratorium Com
mittee. Pamphlets on the war have
been circulated in Blacksburg, and

Washington and Lee's participa-
tion in the moratorium, not all of
which is under the sponsorship of
the non-partisan effort, will actually
begin Tuesday night with what is
designed to be a non-partisan, in-
dividualized doorbell-ringing session,
Students will attempt to exchange
ideas on the war with townspeople
at this time.

On Wednesday, a series of six
speeches, reflecting various aspects
of the Vietnam conflict, is tentatively
scheduled for Lee Chapel. The pro-
gram is scheduled to begin at 10
a.m. and will probably last between
two and two and and a half hours,

Rev. Charles Swezy of Lexington,
who will discuss “Conflict in Viet-

university president, said students
would not be prohibited from parti-
cipating in the moratorium on theil

A student-faculty Moratorium
Committee is attempting to construct
organized activities for the obser-
vance. According to Virginia’s stu-
dent paper, The Cavalier Daily,
hourly church services are being
planned together with a bell-tolling
ceremony.

Senator George McGovern will
speak tonight in Virginia’s University
Hall. On Monday Arthur Waskow
of the Institute of Policy Studies
will speak. This will be followed by
a film series on Tuesday.

Wednesday's program at
tentatively schedules Karl
a morning speaker on the steps of
the Rotunda. A pro-peace Vietnam
veteran and perhaps an anti-war
senator may also be presented to-
gether with an afternoon teach-in,
the Cavalier Daily said.

An Act of Faith

The faculty, by relaxing parietal restrictions for fraternity

houses, demonstrated at one reasonableness and good faith.

They were reasonable in that they recognized fraternity
houses, demonstrated at once reasonableness and good faith.
man dormitories. They exhibited good faith in that several
important differences in the natures of fraternity houses as
opposed to dorms does not necessarily make their most recent
relaxation of rules a logical extension o fwhat they passed last
spring with regard to dorms alone.

The differences lie chiefly in the enforcement provisions.
It is the responsibility of the dorm counselors, under the direct
authority of the University, to maintain the rules as they have
been established, and it is the University that is ultimately
responsible for any infraction that occurs.

Such is not the case with fraternities, and as a result it
will be the house, and quite foreseeably, fraternities in gen-
eral, who will bear the responsibility for violation of the rules
they have chosen to adopt. First, the primary responsibility
for enforcement lies not with a detached authority, but with
the fraternity officers themselves. Secondly, between these and
the University stands the Interfraternity Council. And thirdly,
each fraternity is also answerable to a national headquarters.

Because enforcement lies in the hands of parties conceiv-
ably interested in concealing rather than punishing infractions,
many faculty members justifiably doubt that the rules will be
enforced within the houses. The IFC’s history of sporadic en-
forcement offers even less hope, though it pledges automatic
social probation for every violating fraternity.

It has in the past few days given some encouraging signs,
however. Most notable is the consideration the Judicial Board
is giving each fraternity’s set of rules and provisions for en-
forcement before they pass them on to the Student Affairs
Committee, which has the power of final acceptance or rejec-
tion.

But even if the IFC does punish every infraction that comes
to its attention, there still remains the strong possibility that
many will go undetected and unprevented due to lack of ap-
plication of rules at the individual fraternity level. Such abuse
of rules tends to increase in degree of flagrance until a breach,
either of times established or of good conduct, occurs that
cannot be overlooked by anyone.

A national headquarters, concerned that its image has
been hurt at a time when fraternities nationally can ill-afford
adverse publicity, might recall a charter. Moreover, the Uni-
versity, confronted with evidence that fraternities are incapable
of governing themselves, could through the faculty review its
decision and revert to the former set of rules for all houses.
Dean John at the IFC meeting emphasized the closeness of
Monday’s vote, when only speculation could be martialed
against the resolution. We suspect facts supporting the view
currently in the minority would be more than enough to re-
verse the decision and put fraternities in a defensive position
from which it would be hard for them to recover.

We do not want to play the role of the alarmist or the
prophet of doom. We do think it necessary to remind each
house, for that is the level at which enforcement will succeed
or fail, of the implications involved in not taking seriously the
rules most have just finished adopting. The system itself might
not survive the repercussions a severe infraction will undoubt-

edly incur.
The Holdouts

The University this past summer gave $3,000 to help
alleviate the damage done to the area in the August flood.
It moreover donated equipment, and personnel and the few
students who were here performed laudably, we are told, in
the first few hours after the disaster struck.

We were pleased not only by that fact alone, but also
because it seemed to signal a trend toward W&L’s greater in-
volvement in the problems of the community of which it is
a part. The beginnings of that trend were noticeable last sum-
mer when the University made available its athletic facilities to
the people of Lexington.

Finally, of course, the University as an institution is limited
in what it can do, though even that contribution is vital and
should be expanded as much as possible, What is more signifi-
cant is the potential of the University as a group of advantaged
indviduals to act decisively in helping the local people solve the
problems that confront them,

There have long been strictly individual efforts in this
direction, for example Prof. Hodges’ work with the black
people of the area, The most noteworthy instance to date of
a move by a group of organized faculty members is the work
of professors Whitney, Sloss, Zucker and Larue, and Mes.
Pleva. They, under the aegis of the Total Action Against Pov-
erty program and with the cooperation of the University, have
begun teaching basic math and English to teacher aides, The
faculty, like the University can do more, and we see this initial
collective action as an indication that it will.

Clearly, then, the only group yet to add its resources to
any significant degree to the effort currently being made is
the students, and thus far we see no signs which offer hope
that they will in the near future make a collective effort to do so.

 

An Era of Growth
To Begin at W&L?

By MONTY COTTIER

When President Huntley spoke at
the beginning of the term, his ideas
and suggestions on the size of the
university, plans for enlargement,
co-education, and schemes for fi-
nancing it all, murmurs rose fol-
lowed by long discussions on the
stairs of Doremus, in the Dining
Hall, and elsewhere. Now that a
month or so has passed, it might
be well to see what has been done
toward these goals,

First, committees have been form-
ed to study the problems and the
solutions, The Co-education Com-
mittee, of which Professor Hodges
is chairman, has been broken into
two sub-committees. Dean John
heads the subcommittee on Admis-
sions and Student Services, while
Professor DeVogt is in charge of

Letters to the Fditor...

Questions About Oct. 15

Editor, The Friday Ring-tum Phi:

Throughout the discussion of the
October 15 moratorium, insufficient
attention has been given to the na-
tional movement which has nurtured
the forthcoming “Day of Concern”
at W&L.

The promoters of the W&L mora-
torlum have attempted to enlist
speakers of varying viewpoints in
the interest of objectivity. However,
we contend that objectivity is im-
possible under the circumstances:
The W&L “Day of Concern” can-
not be divorced from the national
movement, which is most surely non-
objective. According to Wednes-
day’s Wall Street Journal, national
organizers of the protest “hope that
a day of dramatic but peaceful
demonstrations will touch off a con-
tinuing grass-roots campaign to pres-
sure the President into rapidly with-
drawing troops from Vietnam.”

The W&L program will not be
viewed by outsiders as an open dis-
cussion of our role in Vietnam, but
rather it will be viewed as a con-
tribution to the national campaign
“to presure the President” into a
rapid troop withdrawal. In fact, the
W&L moratorium has already been
linked to the national movement by
a recent article in the Richmond
Times-Dispatch which described the
various anti-war rites to be held in
Virginia on October 15.

Consequently, we ask the mora-
torilum organizers at W&L: If ob-
jectivity is a goal of the “Day of
Concern,” why has the local move-
ment scheduled events on October
15 instead of another day, and why
has it made use of the Vietnam
Moratorium Committtee’s national
advertising in promoting the W&L
activities? Furthermore, why has the
local movement countenanced the
emotional dramatics of protest by
urging students not to attend classes
on October 15, whereas a non-con-
flicting afternoon or evening pro-
gram would have been possible?

We would welcome an open dis-
cussion of our role in Vietnam, if
such a discussion were held in a
truly objective atmosphere—on a
different day, independent of any
national movement, and without an
aura of protest; but since the “Day
of Concern” does not meet these
criteria, and since success is often
measured by numbers, we must urge
students to withhold their de facto
support from a cause with which
they may be in substantial disagree-
ment by not attending the mora-
torium activities on October 15.

Clarifications Of Oct. 15

to the Editor of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

As publicity chairman for the
Vietnam Moratorium on October 15,
I should like to make a statement
to your readers about the purpose
of the activities being held on that
day at Washington and Lee and in
Lexington, | should also like to ask
you, if you find it possible, to an-
nounce this matter so that the com-
munity as a whole can be made
aware of it,

The purpose of the Moratorium js
not to protest the Vietnam War. It
is rather to provide a forum for
discussion of the issue which con-
cerns all Americans so profoundly
The activities are as follows: On
Tuesday evening, October 14, stu-
dents will be ringing doorbells and
talking to citizens about the war, in
an effert to communicate matters
of mutual concern. On Wednesday,
there will be a program of speakers
at Lee Chapel from 10 am. to
approximately 12 noon. The speak

ers include the Reverand David
Sprunt, the Reverand Charles
Swezey, Professor Milton Colvin.
Professors have the option of dis-
missing their classes to attend this
program. In the afternoon, stu-
dents may indulge in discussions or
in peaceful demonstrations (either
for or against). In the evening, there
is planned a program of poetry read-
ing and a song fest. The Lexington
community is encouraged to attend
any or all of these functions.

I should like to emphasize that
those persons who have claimed that
this Moratorium is another protest
against the war are entirely mis-
taken. Many persons supporting and
participating in the program have
varied views. This is, it seems to
me, a vital way of carrying on the
democratic process.

Sincerely,
David H. Zucker

“Quiet Discrimination”
To the editor of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

There is a situation in the City of
Lexington that angers me beyond
reprieve. It is well concealed but
very effective. It is what is referred
to as quiet discrimination. If a Lex-
ington resident is approached, he
will assuredly deny the existence of
illegal discrimination and he might
even be insulted.

Nevertheless, Lexington is rotten
with prejudice. I need cite one ex-
ample to satisfy the skeptics in this

community. Several night ago there
was a meeting of the Lexington
Human Relations Council, Its prime
purpose was the discussion of a
study done by the committee to
determine the extent of racism in
the city. The results of this study
were appalling. The council asked 8
major merchants to attend the meet-
ing so that the problem could be
discussed. A totally reasonable and
justifiable request. Well, not one of
these super-8 community leaders ap-
peared. I need not make accusations
as to why I feel that they failed
to appear. Some of them gave ex-
cuses, such as baby sitting. Some
just ignore the council. What is
left to be done when the people in
the position to solve a problem turn
their back on it?

I have a request to make, All
this situation please contact me at
463-6668. | mean to do something
about this.

This may not be my hometown,
but as long as I live here it is my
obligation to work for what I feel
is just. Equality of men is not only
just, it is required by law. Dr.
Hodges is working hard with the
Human Relations Council. | have
spoken with him about this letter
and he looks for more active partici-
pation of all people living, working
and studying in this community.

Let us not stand by silently any
longer, please; it’s time we all got
up and started working for equality
among all men. Give a damn!

A Fable

By MACK WOODWARD
Tuesday Edition

Once upon a time there was an
International Fun Circus that came
every week to a sleepy hamlet
called Little Lick. The townspeople
in the litthe community came fe-
luctantly to the circus every week
because they'd already paid for sea-
son tickets to the shows. The bad
thing about it was that every week
the shows were always the same.

The most familiar personage in
the circus was the  ringmaster,
Chuckles the Clown, Unlike many
clowns, Chuckles was never happy.
He had two magic horns, one in
each hand which he honked to call
order in the circus to start the acts
in the show, The right hand horn
meant “yes,” and the left hand horn
meant “no,” but they both sounded
the same and often Chuckles got
them mixed up,

At the beginning of the show,
Chuckles would honk his horns to
create activity (he got se confused
sometimes about which was “yes”
and which “no”). And even after he
honked his horns to start the show,
all the performers would just stand
in the ring and do nothing at all.
This was a real treat for the Little
Lick community because Chuckles
would begin to honk his horns wilid-
ly to try to look funny and busy.

The star performers in the circus
would sometimes get into the act
with Chuckles, There was one crowd
pleaser, Powell, the Pulsating Por-
poise, whom the company in the
circus tried to teach to talk. He
was funny because all of a sudden
he would squeal and bark (as all
porpoises are wont to do) in the
middle of Chuckles’ act. Sometimes
J. J,, the Trained Weasel, wouid
forget his script for his act so in-
siead he paced back and forth in
his cage io attract the crowd's at-
fenton

Occasionally, the ferocious Woody
Woodchuck would rear back on his
hind legs in the middle of the ring
and try to make loud noises, but

Powell the Pulsating Porpoise and
Chuckles could easily drown out his
squeaks by barking and honking.

The worst part of the circus for
Chuckles was the booming voice of
John W. Davis’ great, great grand-
son. Whenever he spoke, order
would break out, leaving Chuckles
in complete disarray. But finally
Chuckles would fumble for his “yes”
horn and honk it loudly, and every-
thing livened up again briefly,

The end of the circus came when
all the circus performers got tired
of their acts and Chuckles would
put away his magic horns to signify
that the circus was at an end. The
performers would go wearily back
to their respective wagons as
Chuckles would ask the crowd if
they enjoyed the show,

The Little Lick people are a quiet
lot and though they were unhappy
with the circus, it was something to
go see. And after all, the show g0es
on each week and there was always
hope in their simple hearts that the
show might be better the next week.

Academic Progress and the Physical
Plant. Professor John Gunn heads
the Committee on University Size,
which has not been broken into
subcommittees,

When asked what progress the
committees had made in their re-
search, Dean John replied, “Well,
we don’t have any answers yet, but
we do have a wealth of questions.”
Mr. Hotchkiss, Director of Univer-
sity Development, echoed this when
he remarked in connection with the
funding program, “We are not shirk-
ing, but planning.” Thus, the pri-
mary work at the present seems to
be directed towards a kind of
groundbreaking.

In emphasizing this fact, Dean
John pointed to the issue of co-edu-
cation as an illustration. “If co-
education goes through, then natur-
ally the university must be expanded,
If, on the other hand, we determine
that it would be impossible to so
expand the university, then that
would determine the fate of the
co-educational program. One de-
pends on another, and, although one
does not have precedent over the
— they are certainly interrelat-
ed.

The report of the Co-education
Committee wil be presented to the
faculty in about a month. Among
the problems to be considered in
connection with this report are fi-
nancing, size limitations, and time
necessary to construct new dorms,
buildings, and gymnasium facilities
should the plan pass,

It certainly is an intriguing thing,
this speculation on the ravine cam-
pus. The committees involved could
easily spend their time figuring out
how, if they moved the Commerce
School to the McCormick building,
and the library into a new ravine
location or the west campus, and
build a new building for the His-
tory Department and moved the
whole administration into Washing-
ton Hall and its annexes, the whole
campus could be radically altered
and improved. It is to their credit
laht, although these topics do form
a considerable portion of their dis-
cussion, they still have their eyes
firmly fixed on the concrete prob-
lems of this undertaking.

In the area of financing, Mr,
Hotchkiss said, “Without resorting
to an out-and-out campaign, we are
already receiving many funds. This
project will be financed almost en-
lirely from private funds and dona-
tions. As a measure of the success
of the fund drive, donations this
year have already doubled last

8

year’s,

Therefore, while some of the stu-
dents may have forgotten the “ra-
vine campus” idea of President
Huntley's speech, the administration
has not. Plans for tiers of buildings
down the ravine housing the library,
law school, and other overcrowded
departments and facilities, or build-
ings on the other side for the same
purposes, or combinations of any of
a number of plans are all being con-
a As Mr. Hotchkiss stated,

t's like trying to fit the pieces into
“4 jigsaw puzzle. As soon as one gets
placed where we think it ought to
be, another one comes along and
the whole thing has to be moved
again.”

Even though the plans are cur-
rently just that, and in many cases
haven't progressed beyond notions
or flashes of inspiration, the work of
funding the project has already be-
gun. This is essential, for when the
diagrams and blueprints of the new

expanded campus” and the renoval-

ed and restored “old campus,” as
the two are beginning to be called,
are drawn up, and when architect's
drawings of buildings either cling-
ing to the slope or sitting on the
other side of the ravine are made,
it is essential to know that we have
enough money to change these draw-
ings imo an expanded WAL.

Why should a traditional

Only the new more luxurious full
fashion shape (fuller under-the-
knot, wider throughout) is right with
today’s longer shirt collars, wider
jacket lapels. What's more, this new
full fashion shape is best calcu-

in spite of their diamond shenani-

ever would take their brand of base-
ball very seriously?

The Mets did not have any hitters
or pitchers to speak of, in the begin-
ning and therefore the 1962 Mets
won 40 games in a 162 game sched-
ule. Today the Mets have two great
pitchers, one great hitter, and a very
fine manager. They are also the
National League champions. It is
to their misfortune, though, to have
picked this year for their “impossible
dream,” for they must challenge one
of the finest teams of the °60’s, the
Baltimore Orioles, in the World
Series.

It was thought by many that the
recent playoffs would hinder the
chances of the two leagues’ best
teams of making the World Series.
It just was not to be, however, for
New York drubbed a bumbling At-
lanta team in three straight, and
Baltimore teased Minnesota for two

Twins in the third and final game,

11-2. Thus, the stage was set for
another one of sports’ Cinderella
stories.

Ihe Mets, hoping to follow in the
steps of the other intown Baltimore-
killers (the Jets and Knicks), are a
good team offensively as was shown
against the Braves, but can not hope
to get by the Orioles in similar
fashion. Therefore if the road to
glory is to be ridden at all by the
Mets, it will be achieved by the
likes of Tom Seaver, Jerry Koos-
man, et al. In other words, the pitch-
ing staff. It was rather shaky against
the Braves, a luxury the Mets can
not afford against Baltimore.

It is not hard to describe the
Orioles. They are simply a team
that can beat another in every pos-
sible way. It is certain that George
Bamberger (the Oriole _ pitching
coach) would match his hurlers
against any staff in baseball and
probably come out on top. Mike
Cuellar, Dave MeNally, and Jim
Palmer provide the Orioles with a
spectacular starting rotation. Al-
though maybe not quite as effective

as the Mets’ 1-2 combination of
Seaver-Koosman, it does give the
Orioles more depth. Baltimore’s
corps of reliefers also has the depth
advantage over the Mets.
Offensively, one must give the
overall advantage definitely to the
Orioles. Cleon Jones and Tommie
Agee of the Mets had fine years, to
be sure, but if they or maybe Art
Shamsky do not hit for the Mets,
who will? On the other hand, the
Orioles have so many players com-
ing off fine years that the team can
explode any time. A comparison of
the two teams offensive statistics
makes for a pretty bleak picture for

the Mets: Team Avg. Balt. .265,
N.Y. .241; Runs. Balt. 779, N.Y.
632; Home Runs, Balt. 175, N.Y.
109,

None of the games in the World
Series is going to be decided by
bad defensive play, for both teams
are sound, with Baltimore once
again being the sounder on the
strength of having such specialists as
Brooks Robinson, Mark Belanger,
and Paul Blair in the line-up,

But the 1969 World Series will be
no mismatch. Too many times
in professional sports have
season statistics proved to be mean-

Generals Succumb to Centre
“Maximum Effort” Sited by Leslie

Another tradition, Washington
and Lee’s “Homecoming Hex” on
football opponents, has gone by the
boards. Last week's loss to Centre
marked the first time in ten years
that the Generals have been defeat-
ed before the olds grads.

Despite the narrow 14-7 loss to
Centre, Coach Buck Leslie was
pleased with several aspects of the
game that might aid the W&L cause
Saturday when the Generals play
Hampden-Sydney.

“We gave maximum effort,” said
the head man. “That's not to say
we didn’t make a few mistakes, but
we gave away a lot of size and
speed.” Another feature that pleased
Coach Leslie was the Generals’ phy-
sical condition. Towards the end of
the game the Colonels were visibly
spent.

Both these observations from last
week's game could bring dividends
Saturday against the H-S Tigers.
Hampden-Sydney is regarded by
many as the potential number one
small college team in the state. Their
leading runner is hard-nosed Tom
Whorely, a boy who carries the ball
some twenty-five to thirty times a
game. “He comes to play,” warns
defensive coach Boyd Williams. The
Tigers are 2-1, having defeated Se-
wanee and Bridgewater handily after
a very close loss (19-12) to a tough
Shepherd team.

The injuries in the Centre game
were few but costly nevertheless.
The final word isn’t in yet on wheth-
er senior tri-captain and starting
center Thunder Thornton will have
to undergo surgery on his injured
knee. If he does, it will be a severe
blow to the Generals. When Thorn-
ion was injured last week aaginst
Centre, untried freshman Bim Glas-
gow had to be pressed into service,
and it was a bad snap on a W&L
punt that led directly to Centre's
winning touchdown in the fourth
quarter. The decision on Thornton's
knee will come on Friday.

Other than Thornion, the only
other ailing General is defensive
back Dave Brooks, who is bothered
by a bruised thigh muscle. But
Brooks is expected to start at his
usual safety position against the
ligers. For the second straight week,
