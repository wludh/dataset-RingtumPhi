Jarrett. That night, Ed Grimsley of
the Richmond Times-Dispatch talk-
ed at Lee Chapel on “A Humorist
Looks at the World.” The most re-
cent event took place this afternoon
with the presentation of a seminar
on “What's Wrong with the News-
papers,’ by Prof. Paxton Davis of
the Journalism Department.

Despite a home basketball game
on Monday night, Mr. Grimsley
drew a fair crowd. He was. introduc-
ed by Mr. Holland of ‘the Public
Relations Department, who inform-
ed the audience that Grimsley wrote
a humor column for the Richmond
Times-Dispatch while serving the
paper as an associate editor.

Mr. Grimsley’s speech Was inter-
esting as well as humorous. F'rst,
he spoke about the “foxhound con-
troversy,” whereby the establish-
ment of the foxhound as the state
dog has created all sorts of prob-
lems. He went on to relate some en-
couniers that he has had with those
who have been offended by his ar-
ticles.

The main point of Grimsley's
speech was that humor is on the de-
cline because people can no longer
laugh at themselves. He referred to
the present-day censorship of media
which might offend certain groups to
back up his argument. In conclusion,
he praised humor as a “solvant of
terror and tension.”

A measure of validity

The first step is in progress toward considering the feasi-
bility of coeducation at this institution. Although the Contact
Committee claims that it “in no way intends Co-ed Week
to be an endorsement of coeducation,” it must be realized
by everyone involved that coeducation is, indeed, on trial,
and that an orderly, pleasant, intellectual and rewarding
week of campus activity will be a significant argument for
proponents of coeducation,

The social advantages to be gained from such a drastic
change in the patterns of W&L life are but incidential to the
effects coeducation will have upon the intellectual life of
this institution, for it remains, basically, an academic insti-
tution. Proponents of coeducation claim that it will add to
the intellectual environment of this University. They state
that at present, some forty percent of America’s college
population is excluded from admission to W&L by sex, and
that this represents the loss of the intellectual contributions
and views of a sizable minority. They also charge that a
society without women is unnatural and that this is reflected
in an unnatural and, therefore, inferior classroom situation.
Opponents of coeducation claim it will be disruptive of the
academic life of the community and will be detrimental to
the traditions and institutions of W&L.

There are numerous other arguments to be made both
for or against, and of greater or lesser importance concern-
ing coeducation. But the important thing about the above
assertions is that they are all by nature testable, and that
Co-ed Week and next year’s exchange program can be the
measure of their validity.

While next year’s exchange will present a_ relatively
normal campus situation with only thirty girls at most and
spread over the length of three semesters, Co-ed Week does
not. This is only the second week of the semester with work-
loads still somewhat light. Therefore, it is only natural for
W&L students to allow Co-ed Week to take on a circus at-
mosphere with the possibilities for social contacts in the fore
and studies and academics in the background.

It should therefore be kept in mind that Co-ed Week
is an experiment. As every science student knows, one of
the first requirements of an accurate and successful experi-
ment is to control certain variables. If Co-ed Week is to
achieve any progress in evaluating the above claims, it is
incumbent upon every W&L student to approach the week’s
program with a degree of normality and_ intellectual
curiosity.

Toward a liberalization of cuts

Mike McCall, Sophomore class President, recently pre-
sented the Executive Committee with a petition concerning
the liberalization of Sophomore cuts. The petition was later
withdrawn because the EC felt the topic would be covered
by a special committee report to be presented in two weeks.

Regardless of the manner in which the EC approaches
the matter, McCall’s contention and requests are sound.
Basically, the Sophomore class plan calls for the granting
of unlimited cuts to all second semester Sophomores with a
Grade Point Ratio of 2.4 or better the previous semester.
This is hardly an overwhelming concession in that these same
students will be given unlimited cuts regardless of GPR only
one semester later.

In the past few years cutting privileges have undergone
drastic revision at W&L. Only a short time ago unlimited
cuts were given to no one but Dean’s List students regardless
of class level. Freshmen were allowed no more than two
cuts per course.

Inequities still remain. Sophomores have no more than
the six cuts per course that they had as Freshmen, while
their maturity has, in many cases, soared, Only one class
higher, Juniors are given unlimited cuts in all courses.

In analyzing the question it might be asked, what is the
purpose of limiting cuts? Is it to force students to apply
themselves to their studies? Is it to develop a habit of class
attendance? Does it really achieve these things?

When unlimited cuts were first approved, there was no
surge of cutting among Juniors and Seniors. We have every
confidence that rt d study were conducted, ir would be
found that those students who took all their cuts in their
Freshman and Sophomore years are the only ones that abuse
the unlimited cutting privileges, and that those who cut
rarely in their first years kept up their attendance in the
upperclass years. And as almost any professor will admit,
those students who cut least do best.

The University’s faith in the above statement is demon-
strated in the fact that Freshman and Sophomore Dean's
List students also are given unlimited cuts, True to form,
these students rarely abuse their newly won cutting privileges.

The conclusion, therefore, must be that enforced cuts
do not nec essarily ac hies e any lasting effect. In view of past
experience, it seems perfectly reasonable to allow McCall's
request, and even {to expand it to first semester Sophomores.
lt gives unlimited cuts only to the better students
The chances are they will not

the ones

who cut least. abuse the

privilege.

Repercussions from Graebner

Kelsey challenges attitudes Lowry calls for emphasis
toward men and resources upon institutional growth

By REEVE KELSEY

There were several disturbing
undercurrents in last month's Found-
ers Day adress by Dr. Norman A,
Graebner. His attitudes toward “re-
levant” educations, natural resource
scarcity, and the future of man
ought to be criticized and discussed.

Dr. Graebner rejects the “liberal
arts” education as being too super-
ficial. Recent trends in the Wash-
ington and Lee curriculum suggest
that an enforced, rigorous liberal
arts program is no longer accept-
able. Dr. Graebner never really ex-
plicitly pronounces an educational
theory, yet he is continually hedg-
ing around one. He feels that after
four years of college a_ student
should have a closed, established in-
tellectual system which will last him
the rest of his life. To accomplish
this. professors must establish a con-
sistent regimented body of thought.
Dr. Graebner paraphrases John
Fischer's lament, “Individual teach-
ers may have their philosophical
preferences and personal convic-
tions, but among teachers there is
no coherent thought.” Dr. Graebner
continues, “They (students) con-
clude that no body of thought is
superior to any other body of
thought. They have not learned to
think about public issues—to make
up their own minds in a rational
manner.”

1 would challenge Dr. Graebner
to say that for any given problem
there is one right answer and all
the rest are wrong, and that Dr.
Graebner’s ideology is right all the
time. After one has finished col-
lege, we would hope that one has
realized that there is not just one
right and one wrong answer. There
are many problems (Vietnam) where
all the solutions are “wrong” to the
extent that we are faced with a
series of options none of which are
pleasant. Both the questions and the
answers are not as black and white
as Dr. Graebner believes. Further-
more, is not the absence of a co-
herent intellectual system, a sysiem
in itself—the logical choice that no
system is perfect and that each set
of circumstances must be judged by
the relevant factors?

We are also distressed as Dr.
Graebner’s McCarthy-like attitude
that education should “begin with a
list of public enemies.” We agree
with Dr. Graebner that a student
should be allowed as specialized or
relevant education as he desires; any
attempt, however, to regiment a
university's finished product should
not be tolerated. If a student feels
that rationally, to the overall benefit
of society, the Everglades should be
sacrificed for an airport, the right
answer is not “no.”

We would take issue with Dr.
Graebner's statement, “For there are
limits to industrial growth and ex-
ploitation, and long ago the costs
of economic expansion, when mea-
sured by business stalistics, began to
exceed what such a large and rich
nation could really bear.” What are
these costs that he is referring to?
If the costs of that economic ex-
pansion are greater than we are
willing to bear, why has society con-
tinually agreed to bear these costs?
The social costs of industrialization
may be approaching the limits of
what society will tolerate as ste-
gested by the recent public concern
pollution and the ecological!
equilibrium. But social costs are just
a small factor of economic expan-
son. But we afe very curious to
know just which set of business
statistics show that the United
States has been growing too fast?

We are amused by Dr. Graebner’s
rather closed view on natural fe-
sources. He slates, “No longer can
there be exploitation in the name of
progress; there must Be conserva
tion in the mame of beauty and
survival.” Oh. the beauty of an iron
ore deposit many feet underground!
“Conservation is the name of Peatty
and survival.” however, in the long
run is more costly to both the pres
ent and future societies than a
rapidly advancing technological-in
dustrial use of natural
today. One is reminded of a Seot
tssh conservationist in the eighteenth
century urging his neighbors to
consume less peal each winter, so
there will be enough peat to supply
the world for the next 200 years
Dr. Grabner assumes thal there will

aver

FesOurces

be little economic or technological
erowth in the future. This is mitch
than
the assumption thal technology will
advance indefinitely

Harold J]. Rarnett and Chandler
Morse in their book, “Scarcity and

more harmful and unrealisth

Growth the Foonomics of Natural
Resource Availability” (lext for
Fconomics 259) discuss the obliga
ions of present Penerilions to con
scivVe fesifce ayy 6filtife genera

tions. They conclude: 1) Any re-
source conservation for future gen-
erations is basically an investment
in the future—a sacrifice of present
consumption in favor of future re-
turns. Barnett and Morse conclude
that by any economic standard, this
investment “will reduce the eco-
nomic value of output over the
time period taken as relevant for
the calculation and may, by curb-
ing research and capital formation,
have a perverse effect on future out-
put and welfare.” 2) “The Conserva-
tionists’ premise that the economic
heritage will shrink in value unless
natural resources are ‘conserved,’ is
wrong for a progressive world.”
Barnett and Morse state that the
per capita income has been almost
doubling each generation—hardly
the sign of a declining economic
heritage.

Dr. Graebner urges the U.S. re-
turn to “simpler lives.” He chooses
technological stagnation and a
planned economic contraction to fit
the needs of a neo-Thoreauvian
world. We hope that our education
will not teach us to look to the
future and draw back, but how to
best guide the rapidly expanding
technological frontiers to find “hu-
man happiness.”

By Prof. 8. T. Lowry

We must commend Dr. Graebner
for choosing two timely topics for
his Founder’s Day address. We also
agree with him most heartily in
deploring irrelevance in education
and the narrow profit motive ra-
tionalization for resource use and
planning. The rhetorical demands
upon an address delivered at a cere-
monial occassion frequently blur
the incisiveness of its content. It
might, therefore, be a contribution
to fruitful discussion to summarize
a concise view of educational and
resource policy with which, Dr.
Graebner would probably take some
issue.

In reference to academic relev-
ance, it is a source of continuing
embarrassment to the academic pro-
fession that the very word, Aeca-
demic when used as descriptive of
an argument or a question, “That
issue is academic,” of “That argu-
ment is academic,” has come to
mean irrelevant or pointless. Ht is
probably time for the liberal arts
justification to be clearly separated
from a brand of dilettantish toying
with synthetic realities primarily
related to narrow class value sys-
tems or religious traditions. Educa-
tion should be directed toward stim-

“Law and Order” was the key issue
in several mayoral elections last
year — New York City, Cleveland,
Los Angeles, and Minneapolis —
and with the present Attorney Gen-
eral John Mitchell emerging as the
strong man of the Nixon Admini-
stration, it should be an important
issue in the 70's.

For the first time, CONTACI

old Hayes, Editor of Esquire, and
William Rusher, Publisher of Na-

These two distinguished journalists
represent opposite ends of the poli-

ulating imaginative and creative
acceptance of the challenges of the
future which undoubtedly involves
larger and larger systems of compre-
hension and value judgements as
our society grows in complexity and
impact on the environment be-
comes more involved, The demands
on our education are certainly for
more commitment to face real
problems of society, and expanding
coherence of our idea systems. I
personally believe that the answer
to this challenge is the acadmic
dignity of the intensely committed
position. What we need, is not pro-
fessors and students who all think
more intensively alike, but an aca-
demic tradition where it isn’t con-
sidered poor taste to believe in
something that is controversial. In
the arena of vital concrete projec-
tion of various idea systems, there
are many basic policies upon which
all agree, and both the devotees
of Thoreau and anarchistic Laissez-
faire will have to agree that Lake
Eire cannot persist as the largest
open cesspool in the midcontinent.
After all, implementable concensus
requires public support whether ar-
rived at from degree, or discursive
evolution. The polite noncommital

pseudo academic approach serves
only as a facade behind which
organized selfish interests pursue

their own ends while the public,
relying on elucidation from the in-
tellectual leadership, basks in a false
light of culpably courteous irre-
sponsibility.

On the issue of conservation, it
is true that we have passed through
a phase in which our society de-
veloped a childishly simplistic ra-
tionalization that individual profit
was an adequate measure of re-
source exploitation and social well-
being. An out-growth of this view is
the continued emphasis on the ma
terial measures of economic and
social progress. While Dr. Graebner
suggests that we should consider a
simpler life style with a withdrawal
from our present level of techno
logical irresponsibility, this seems to
be too narrow a frame of reference,
and not likely to be implemented in
our society. What we must demand
as citizens, is that we deal with
reality, and “pay the piper.” We
cannot continue to expand our
system of social planning and de-
cision making to maintain co-
herence with the scale of our
technology. Economic and ecologic
balance requires that when world
atmospheric conditions are being
seriously deteriorated by society's
technological pursuits, then world
decision making structures need to
be established and our knowledge
be accompanied by a concomitant
growth in responsibility and instru-
tional organization. When produc-
tion was based on the subsistance
family farm unit, the rules of pri-
vate property were generally ade-
quate to maintain balanced control
over the technological impact of
those pursuits.

The real challenge is to go
forward with the expansion of our
sysiems of social control and re-
sponsibility to keep pace with our
scientific knowledge of our environ-
ment, and the long range techno-
ligical impact of our industrial ma
chinery and population. The lag in
public awareness and in structured
systems of control and decision mak
ing is so pitifully obvious that curb
ing technology is probably a current
expedient. Hopefully, responsible
education and public awareness will
help develop a working system
whereby our society can make
effective choices that will keep tech
nological and industrial develop
menis contributing to the kind of
life we really desire when reflecting
upon the choices before us. Ht is
fairly obvious that happiness does
nol lie in the continued expansion
of material
fruits of
hucksiers in
profits

Probably the real challenge to
American life is that most of the
things we need namely a tremendous
sufge of sOcial responsibility
education. cultural depth, ind
sensitivity cannot be organized
under the egis of a sysiem of com

Baltimore beats Washington and Lee
but Generals destroy Lynchburg by 45

By JOHN ROBINSON
Sports Editor

So far the basketball team seems
to be in the post-exam slump. After
squeaking out a win over the Hamp-
den-Sydney Tigers, W&L had the
insult returned by visiting Baltimore
University. The Bees came from
behind to tag a 70-66 loss on Wash
ington and Lee’s record. A pair of
Philadelphia bred juniors took
credit for the Baltimore victory,
Bunny Wilson convinced the crowd
that he was rightfully the nation’s
second best small college scorer.
Charles Olkowski at 6-6 canned
some clutch foul shots when they
were Vital.

With a large partisan following
at Doremus the Generals possessed
a 31-26 lead after the initial period.
The home squad did not play spec-

tacularly well, but they did play
better than their Maryland op-
ponents. The big boys-Cartwright,

Neer, and Daniel were the main-
springs to the Blue attack.

Defense was exceptionally good
too for the General five. Until late
in the conflict, Wilson was held to
sporadic shots.

The crowd was hushed with
about 9:00 left. The play on the
court got considerably tougher and
the momentum swung Baltimore's
way even though the score was 51-

37 W&L'’s favor. The visitors
whittled away at the W&L lead
for six minutes. At that moment

Baltimore snatched on to the lead,
but the Generals fought back in a
see-saw affair.

The last minute was a traumatic
experience for Coach Canfield’s
crew. Olkowski went to the charity

Natators splash to another win
breaking Old Dominion’s records

Ihe General natators narrowly
squeaked by a strong Old Dominion
team in a well fought meet that saw
all but one of the Old Dominion
pool records either broken or tied.
The W&L swimmers only captured
three out of a possible ten individual
firsts, but the Blue depth in all
events plus winning both relays
gave the team a 54-50 victory giving

them a 3-2 record for the season.

Bill Brumback led the General
attack winning both the 50 and 100
yard freestyle with times of 22.7
and 50.9 Coach Stearns
made several dramatic changes in
the traditional starting line-up. Aven
Sharp, traditionally the General
breastsiroker, was converted into a
freestyle sprinter and anchored the
winning 400 yard medley relay team
of co-captain Roger Martin, Price
Blackford, Bim Clark, and Sharp.
Their winning time was 5:59.8 sec-
onds.

In the 1000 yard freestyle, Bert
Meem and John Lawlor combined
for second and third places. Alan
Corwith won the 200 yard freestyle
with a 1:54.9 second mark followed
by Dave Kympton in third place
Brumback then captured the 50
yard freestyle beating teammate Bim
Clark by three-tenths of
Entering the diving event, the score
was W&L 28, Old Dominion 15

Old Dominion then began to
close the gap. W&L diver Jay Marks
was only able to capture a third
Bim Clark was defeated in the 200
yard butterfly getting a second for
himself, while Bert Meem,

stripe and sunk the first of a one-
and-one effort but missed on the

bonus. Stu. Fauber went high to
control the rebound and time-ou
was requested. The score stood at
66-64 Baltimore’s favor, W&L’s

ball, and 29 seconds were left in
the game.

A bad in bounds play cost the
Generals a precious chance. Neer
was Called for contact with Okawski
who once again made his first shot
and then talleyed on his second try.
[he score now was 68-64. Neer
redeemed himself by scoring and
immediately calling for time.

Now Baltimore had the ball and
a 68-66 lead. In the throw-in Neer
was charged with a technical foul
by hitting the man who was out of
bounds. Olkowski hit the technical
and still another foul shot to make
the final score 70-66.

In summary Washington and Lee
had an excellent opportunity to de
feat a fine ball club, but the chance
slipped out of their hands. An ad-
mirable job was done in holding
the Baltimore club to 70 points.
Yet, offensively the teamwork was
rough around the edges and passing
was not as sharp as it could have
been.

Things took a turn for the better
against Lynchburg. Doremus rocked
as the Hornets got stung 105-60,
that’s right 105-60. W&L pressed

the visitors from the tip-off until
the final seconds. Lynchburg was
definitely rattled and the Generals
were out to make amendments for
their loss to Baltimore.

Mike Daniel stole the show early
hitting 16 of the first 23 Blue points.
Marvelous Mike closed out the even-
ing with a total of 23 points. Neer
and Cartwright each put in 17 points
plus Neer pulled in 19 rebounds,
Cartwright was devastating once
more with his gliding lay-ups.

Now Old Dominion looms ahead.
O.D.C, is ranked number 15 in the
nation’s small college teams. They
have only suffered a single loss. If
the Generals can turn out a perfor-
mance like the one last night, the
O.D.C, team may have 2 losses.

Football practice

The silent prayer on every W&L
football player’s lips is: “Please
Lord, let there be an early spring.”
Yes it’s true, it’s not an “in” joke.
The “emotion kids are back,” the
“hard core is returning.” The boys
are back and ready for their annual
mud bath. At 3:30 P.M. on Wednes-
day February 11 the gang will once
again hit the soggy turf of Wilson
Field in preparation for the 1970
football season in what is affection-
ately termed W&L’s spring (?7!!)
practice.

Iwo second semester freshmen,
Steve Fluharty and Tom Van Am-
burgh are destined to hold down the
quarterback slot as sophomores next
year. A further report on the pro-
gress of the “search and build” mis-
sion will be upcoming.

So don’t be alarmed at the scream-
ing, yelling, and cursing you will
hear coming from Wilson Field.
