Officials Discuss

By MIKE HOUCK

Ihree Washington and Lee ad-
ministration officials are attending
a discussion at Randolph-Macon
Women's College in Lynchburg on
the possible establishment of an
eight-college student exchange pro-
gram.

The proposed exchange program
would be between four women’s
colleges—Hollins, Mary Baldwin,
Randolph-Macon, and Sweet Briar-
and four men’s colleges—Davidson,
Hampden-Sydney, Randolph-Macon,
and Washington and Lee.

 

Ihe W&L officials attending to-
day's conference are Lewis G. John,
dean of students, Frank A. Parsons,
assistant to the president, and Dr.
William J. Watt, associate dean of
the College.

The possibility of W&L’s entrance
into such a program was discussed
last Tuesday by the Faculty Discus-
sion Club. At this meeting a detailed
plan of the proposed exchange pro-
gram was presented and questions
concerning it were entertained.

The proposed program would in-
volve a limited number of juniors,

According to a memorandum dis-

W&L Students To Attend
Washington Demonstration

By GARY POLIAKOFF

Approximately 50 to 60 W&l
students are going to Washington,
D.cC., for the three-day anti-war
demonstrations being held there this
weekend, They will travel by private
cars, leaving at different times on
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday,

Walter Sales, president of the
Young Democrats, said that no plans
have been made for any anti-war
activities at W&L, few col
leges are sponsoring campus demon
strations or discussions of any kind.

Most peace efforts will be made in
Washington, although in this area,
the University of Virginia planned
a march in Charlottesville for Thurs-
day afternoon and Hollins College
is holding a few discussion groups
today.

At other nearby colleges various
numbers of people are going to

Washington, most of them by pri
vate transportation. In some in
stances buses have been chartered to
carry large groups of people.

In Washington Georgetown Uni-

first year should prove all or part
of its features to be undesirable or
unfeasible.

On December | the question of
Washington and Lee’s participation
in the proposed program will come
before the faculty. At this time final
statements and reports will be de-
livered and a decision will be
reached,

Should the faculty agree to the
proposal, the Board of Trustees will
have to approve the measure before
it can be implemented.

If the University decides to par-
ticipate it would receive not more
than 30 exchange students, the ma-
jority of whom would come from
the participating women’s colleges.
A similar number of Washington and
Lee students would go to other col-
leges.

The matter has been under study
at W&L for several months, Uni-
versity President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley attended a series of discussions
concerning the desirability of a stu-
dent exchange program during
February and March.

Late in March President Huntley
appointed a special ad hoc commit-
tee to discuss the problems, ques-
tions, and concerns that such an ex-
change program would introduce.
The committee's report was designed
as a basis for President Huntley's
continuing discussions with repre-
sentatives of other institutions.

The work of the committee in-
cluded discussion of financial mat-
ters, currigculum implications, and
ways in which student affairs would
be affected.

In July Huntley met with the
presidents of the other seven col-
leges for a three-day discussion at
the Peaks of Otter Lodge on the
Blue Ridge Parkway. This workshop
was used to formulate basic policies
to which the respective faculties and
boards of trustees could react

At this discussion tentative agree-
ments were reached concerning ap-
plication and admission, social regu-
lations, and financial arrangements

Huntley told the faculty at its
first meeting this academic year that
he would ask the Committee on
Courses and Degrees to review the
eniire matter of an exchange pro-
gram.

After studying the subject
thoroughly, he transfers his im-

traditional technique, using an ink
stick which is freshly ground in

The black ink is mixed with vege

shading of color depends on the
order the colors are picked by the
brush.

The intricate process of Chinese
painting requires many years to
master. Devoted students, Ju noted,
must learn slowly but surely, learn-

themselves the trees, mountains, and

An Appraisal

We were pleased that the Executive Committee adopted
Dave Bethea’s resolution concerning student involvement in
recruiting problems. That alone is significant.

What is more to the point, of course, is the goal of this
involvement. The proposal forms a committee which will
“thoroughly research the methods, approaches, and problems
encountered in the recruitment of the underprivileged, with
particular interest given to recruiting that group which is con-
spicuously lacking on our campus—the Negro.”

If the committee formulates a plan, the EC will invest the
investigatory group with sub-committee status so that the
plan may be implemented.

The public recognition of the overly homogeneous nature
of the W&L student body, and the EC’s determination to act
to rectify it, are both significant and long overdue. This school
has never utilized the potential recruiting resources it can call
upon, namely students and alumni, and it is time the roles of
both were greatly expanded.

It does occur to us that objections to this move will center
around two points. First, why involve students in admissions
work? One answer is that a student can be more convincing
and informative on many matters when talking to a prospective
student than an administrator might be. Further, of course,
it is the students who stand to lose most if the student body
is deficient in any way.

Many people will concede the role students can play in
the effort but object to the clause in the resolution which
focuses attention specifically on the Negro as an example
of the underprivileged groups to which the EC feels W&L
has been remiss in addressing itself.

This second objection can be met on several points. In the
first place, the Admissions Office has already exerted consider-
able effort toward recruiting the underprivileged, especially
the Negro. The minimal success they have encountered indi-
cates the need for the additional help the EC hopes to give
them.

Moreover, the type of students of which W&L is presently
composed are more accessible by traditional means of com-
munication—major among which is reputation—whereas
reaching students from other economic and cultural back-
grounds is likely to require more and different kinds of effort
than is presently being exerted in their direction.

Finally, of course, it is important from an educational
standpoint to make the student body more heterogeneous,
since it is integral to a liberal education that a student en-
counter people from backgrounds other than his own.

We cannot, then, object to the philosophy which prompted
the proposal. We do, however, notice one deficiency in the
machinery that has been set up.

There are inherent in the resolution no formal channels
by which this sub-committee, if it formulates a plan, can work
closely with the Admissions Office, and no directive that the
plan it presents contain ways to do so.

The resolution does provide that “Upon the implementa-
tion of a plan, this sub-committee will work in conjunction
and under the aegis of the Admissions Office.”’ But this pro-
vision seems to allow only as much cooperation as the directors
of the complementary groups wish to maintain. This being
the case, it seems at least as likely that the groups will work in
isolation (or that the student committee will be allowed to
atrophy) as that they will work together to the degree that
they might.

Sharing the Blame

We shared the disappointment of the Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi and the Executive Committee upon learning that the
faculty had passed a new class schedule without consulting
students.

We cannot, however, unlike the Tuesday edition and the
EC, place the blame for this omission entirely on the faculty.
We feel that the Student Curriculum Committee and the EC
were at least equally to blame for their lack of awareness and
concern on the matter.

It is the specific responsibility of these bodies to make
the students’ sentiments a factor of any decision which affects
them. It is true of course that the institutionalized channels
for faculty-student communication are lamentably few, and
we do not mean to apologize for what was an obvious over-
sight on the faculty's part.

Our point merely is this: the Curriculum Committee and
the EC were aware that adaptations to the new system would
be necessary, and that proposals had to be formulated rapidly
because of the time limitations subsequent adaptations and
the publication of the catalog placed on them. With this in
mind, those committees, or at least the Curriculum Committee,
should have acted with the initiative students took last year in
effecting the original move on curriculum,

We might add that there are many other areas into which
students may move, and where their advice and assistance
would be welcomed. It is unlikely, however, that the faculty
will actively seek student aid without some indication of
interest and availability, We trust the students on the various
representative bodies will not again be so remiss, nor allow
the faculty to be.

THE RING-TUM PHI

The Ring-tum Phi 4n Answer to Financial Problems

By MONTY COTTIER

In light of the points brought up
by the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi’s arti-
cle concerning the financial prob-
lems of the fraternities, and especi-
ally the problem faced by many of
the houses of upperclassmen deacti-
vations, it seems only fair to offer
some possible solutions to these
dilemmas.

While the Tuesday edition com-
ments on academics and social
values of the fraternities, and their
relationship to the often heavy losses
among the upperclassmen were ex-
cellent, there was a major area left
untouched. This is the financial
aspect, one which, in light of the
large amounts of financial assistance
granted by the university, should
certainly be considered.

When a senior, who has been liv-
ing in an apartment for two semest-
ers at the beginning of his senior
year, in most cases, examines the
fraternity concept, he is likely to
encounter difficulties in justifying
the payment of the same dues and
expenses as he did when a sopho-
more,

After all, by his senior year, a
man who remains at W&L will have

made almost all the contacts he is
going to, settled into a routine of
living, both academic and_ social,
and will be welcome at his house’s
parties and other functions, There-
fore, he may be inclined to de-
activate, in order to save money, to
have money to spend in other ways,
or for pure lack of interest (or a
feeling that the house is no longer
interested in him).

While nothing much can be done
about the lack of interest on the
senior’s part (certainly not if nothing
has been done by his last year
here), steps can be taken to alleviate
the remaining problems.

One solution would be to put
house bills on a graduated scale,
with sophomores paying 125 per
cent of the standard house bill,
juniors the usual rate, and seniors
only 75 per cent. Through this, the
senior is given an initiative to remain
in the house both through financial
considerations and a realization that
the house is sufficiently interested in
the senior class to make an effort
to retain it.

Since in most cases the rents for
apartments are higher than house
board and room costs, the sopho-

mores would be paying amounts
commensurate with the expenses of
the seniors, who must pay these
rents; while the senior’s gradual in-
dependence of the fraternity as he
approaches graduation is reflected in
the costs of membership.

Among the reasons cited by the
Tuesday Ring-tum Phi for deactiva-
tion was “disillusionment with the
fraternity system as a whole.” This
active effort to include the seniors,
involving as it does a small degree
of financial loss for the fraternity
(although this loss is nothing com-

pared to the monetary strictures
imposed on a house by a heavy load
of deactivations), may at least aid
in overcoming this feeling of dis-
illusionment, provided it is not pre-
sented merely as a dry financial
maneuver intended to entice the
senior to put a few more dollars
into the house. It is instead ac-
companied with various other mea-
sures to adjust the house somewhat
to the wants and needs of the
seniors and maintain their involve-
ment in the fraternity and its
activities,

A Disturbing Conversation

By LAWRENCE MeCONNELL

One of our many roving cub re-
porters for the Friday Ring-tum Phi
came into our office yesterday al-
most breathless. He had sprinted all
the way from the second floor of
Washington Hall with his first big
story of the year, fainted over a
typewriter, and had to be revived
by sniffing news ink. Finally, after
two slurps of one of our editors’
guava ice cream cone, he was able
to relate his story.

After waiting outside the door of
one of our distinguished men of
administration on the 2:00-4:00 shift
for 37 days straight, he finally saw
one of our younger professors enter
the office with a look of concern
on his face. Crawling out from be-
hind his cover of an ashtray stand,
he moved stealthily to the door to
listen in on the conversation,

The following conversation was a
transcription of notes that our cub
reporter made in the margins of a

discarded Ring-tum Phi that our
man-on-the-scene pluckily found in
a nearby Washington Hall trash
basket.

Professor: “Dean, I just gotta talk
with you. It’s about the students...”

Dean: “Hm?”

Professor: “The students, Dean!”

Dean: “What? Oh, you frightened
me, | thought you were a student
... now, what's all this about stu-
dents?”

Professor: “Well, sir, I just can’t
understand it. First, they get in-
volved in something — like ihat
Moratorium we had last month—
that was healthy. Then they let it
drop! And you know that new
curriculum we're trying to work up
for next year? Well, last year all
we heard was ‘I don't like the way
courses are now — let's have more
freedom to choose our courses —
even the girls’ schools have an in-
dependent study program, why can't
we?’

ROTC Is Necessary
For Open-Minded W&L

By DOUG HAMILTON
(Editor's Note: This is the con-

When discussing the question of
the Reserve Officer's Training Corps’
future on the Washington and Lee
campus, it is necessary to refrain
from impulsively taking an “anti”
stand in light of the controversy
over the Viet Nam war. Currently
in the United States, there is a large
group which condemns anything to
do with the military, without look-
ing at the entire situation in a ra-
tional and unemotional way. In this
article | will show the advantages
in having a ROTC program, not
only here but on every other uni-
versity campus in the nation. | will
also show why ROTC has a right
to function as it presently does.

Those who attack ROTC often
assert that the goals of the uwni-
versity and a ROTC program are
incompatable. They say that a uni-
versity should stress individuality
and open-mindedness, and that a
ROTC program teaches narrow-
mindedness, and regimentation. If
this were true, then why does the
United States Army have any kind
of officer training program at all
on university campuses? Is the rea-
son not that they want open-minded
clear thinking men to lead our army:
that they don't seek a highly regi-
mented group of cutthroats as some
would have wus believe? Indeed,
ROTC is insirumental in the up-
holding of the American ideal of a
“civilian army.” In proof of this,
is the fact that over 50 per cent of
the officers in our army are drawn
from ROTC programs. Without
ROTC we might find that we do
have a professional army of trained
killers. Therefore, it is to the ad-
vantage of the nation, including
those who oppose what they feel
s a military-industrial complex, to
have ROTC programs. The removal
of academic credit from ROTC
would lessen ils appeal and conse
quently the numbers participating
And as stated earlier, reserve army
officers keep our army non-profes-
sional

ft also appears that some of
those who feel that the university
should be sure to protect and nurture

the rights of individuals don’t adhere
to this ideal themselves. What dif-
ference should it make to one stu-
dent what course of study another
takes?

ROTC is not forced on the uni-
versity. The army makes a contract
with the school administration as to
the credit it receives, and I am sure
that all facets of alloting it credit
are considered. The arguments for
stripping ROTC of academic credit
are vague and illogical. Military his-
tory, strategy, and science are as
much an academic subject as are
political and social science. In ad-
dition, ROTC emphasizes the de-
velopment of personal skills and con-
fidence, leadership, and physical en-
durance and courage, all valuable
traits to have in the “real world.”

In his attack on Washington and
Lee's ROTC program in the last
issue of the Friday Ring-tum Phi,
David Olson questioned the legita-
macy of the position given to ROTC
instructors. He siated that they
don't have the same training as other
professors, and thus should not have
commensurate status and power. |
would disagree with Mr. Olson on
both of these points. Not all sub-
jects require a graduate degree of
their professors. In the case of the
military, experience in the field is
just as important. Mr, Olsen also
failed to show why someone on the
ROTC staff should have any less
interest in the affairs of the Uni-
versity, although he did make the
contention.

The advantage in having military
men present in an academic com-
munity is that neither group loses
sight of the other. This relationship
enabies all to see each other's views,
which are certainly relative to each
other. Ignoring war and armies will
not end international strife; nor
will isolating academic and military
groups from each other accomplish
peace. When one faction of students
feels that other students are “taught
how to be cogs in a great murder
machine.” then it is time for better
communication, not less as would
be the case if ROTC were banned
from campus

in summation, | would say that
we should not only keep ROTC at
Washington and Lee, but should sup
port, encourage, and better atiempt
to understand its goals. Having such
a unit on campus is truly a mark
of an open-minded university com
munity

“So I thought, ‘Well, W&L is
finally coming around —’”

Dean: “Now, wait a minute, com-
ing around to what?”

Professor: “Well, you know, com-
ing around to the national norm of
activism. You read every day about
other campuses and their students—
how involved they are in getting
things done at their schools—and I
just don’t think we're up to the
national average.

“All the figures that Ive ever
read state that approximately 20
percent of students on the average
college campus are involved in off-
campus activities, 30 percent in
extra-curricular activities, 25 percent
in apthy, and the other 25 percent
in school work. So, in effect, almost
100 percent of the students in the
average college campus are involved
in something all of the time, but
our student involvement fluctuates
from about 10 percent to 40 per-
cent—some of them aren't even in-
volved in apathy. And even if they
are involved, they get dis-involved
too easily...

“I'll give you an example. One
of our majors called a meeting of
the rest of the majors in the de-
partment about the new curriculum
changes, and only one other fellow
showed up. I mean, if the students
wanted a change so bad last year,
how come they don't care about
it this year?

“And what about the girls in the
freshman dorms? After they got that
request, only four girls have been
up in the dorms in the last month.
Now the big thing is motorcycles

Dean: “Hold it, hold it! Now. Are
you saying that what you're worried
about is that students lose interest
in something after they get it?”

Professor: “Exactly.”

Dean: “Well, this is a problem.
If what you say is true, then I
think many of my colcagues will
probably look at this coeducation
thing in a new light.”

Professor: “What do you mean
by that?”

Dean: “Well, think of the prob.

would like
reasons why,

to explain the main

First, bear in mind the ambiguity
of the proposition as it was stated
that night, that “all class officers
be required to attend EC meetings.”
This could mean several things,
from the officers attending and re-
maining mute, to their expressing
opinions on everything discussed that
night, sort of a non-voting EC-in-
themselves.

Secondly, how would the rule be
enforced? What would we do with
an officer who willfully and malici-
ously did not attend? Put him on
social or academic probation? Force
him to write cold checks and then
fine him? ete.

My major point, however, was
that we would be defeating the pur-
pose of the resolution by passing
it. In other words, we could not
make the class officers more re-
sponsible or competent by requir-
ing them to attend the meetings.
Jeff Burris admitted to me that
he thought that the officers from
other classes might be less competent
than they should be, and when I
asked what advantage would accrue
from forcing incompetent people to
attend meetings, | received an in-
coherent reply. The point is this:
If the officers of other classes wish
to attend meetings regularly, as do
our officers, if they wish to show
that much interest, then by all
means they should do so. I did not
feel that anything material could be
gained by forcing the officers to
be present. Ogilvie suggested that
Burris call a meeting of all class
officers to discuss the matter. Ac-
cording to my information, such a
meeting will take place some time
in the next two weeks.

Burris’ and Gray’s major rationale
for requesting the resolution was to
achieve greater communication be-
tween the classes and the EC.
Kumpuris pointed out that the class
officers could merely express their
views to their respective EC repre-
sentatives prior to the meeting. 1
maintain that this would certainly
be advantageous, but I also main-
tain that the officers should show
enough interest to remain for the
meeting. If they do not show this
imterest, chances are that they will
not be able to reflect adequately the
views of their classes to begin with.

In sum, | am opposed to the
resolution as it was stated that
night; however | am not opposed
to the rationale behind that resolu-
tion.

In the near future, | hope to con-
duct a survey among the freshmen
to sample their views concerning
coeducation, and I shall, in another
column, explain the reasons why the
freshman motorcycle resolution was
so soundly defeated.

Sincerely,

Alan Prater

Generals

Washington and Lee's 1969 foot-
ball team makes its last public ap-
pearance this Saturday in St. Louis
as the Generals journey to play
Washington University. The game
will be played in Busch Stadium as
part of a charity drive for H.E.L.P.
A crowd of 10,000 to 14,000 is ex-
pected.

“Emotion is going to be a fac-
tor,” noted Coach Leslie. “With 14,-
000 people cheering for Washington,
you know that team will be fired
up. We look for them to be emotion-
ally ready, but then I think we'll be,
too.” The Generals should be up
for the game, as the outcome of
this final ballgame will determine
whether or not Washington and Lee
has a winning season. With last

The soccer team traveled to Springfield, Massachusetts
to compete in the first round of the Eastern Regional NCAA
College Playoffs. Springfield College is W&L’s first opponent,
and the Generals will have to get the offense moving again
after a shoddy performance against Randolph-Macon on
Tuesday if they hope to advance in the tournament.

The NCAA bid was already in
the bag, Coach Lyles was out of
town, and it was the last game of
the season. Maybe these three can
be offered as excuses for the Cien-
erals’ mysterious bad showing against
Randolph-Macon, but the sad fact
is that they were just outplayed by
the Yellow Jackets, and the score
showed it, 3-0. If it had not been

for the hard-nosed play of the Gen-
erals’ full5acks, the score could have
been much higher.

R-M was the aggressor from the
outset, but fortunately they were not
able to capitalize in the first quarter.
W&L was getting the brevks as
Randolph-Macon had three very
near misses. The Yellow Jackets’

week’s upset victory over Southwest-
ern, the Generals are 4-4.

And no one probably wants a
winning season more than Coach
Leslie, who in his first year at the
helm in 1968 piloted the gridders
to a 3-5-1 record. A 5-4 season
would be a big improvement and an
inspiration to build on. “We've
shown improvement in all depart-
ments throughout the season,” Coach
Leslie noted. “And the leadership of
the seniors has been great. Last
Saturday we showed character, but
we must show it one more time.”

Although the nerve-racking deci-
sion Saturday was a “tremendous
win,” as Coach Leslie put it, the
encounter left an ugly trail of in-
juries, Quarterback Chuck Kuhn will
play “as long as he holds up.” Re-
ceiver Frank Stearns, bothered by
an ankle injury, shares the same
fate. Another receiver, Steve Ma-

haffey, pulled a muscle in practice
late Wednesday and will probably
not be at full speed. The defense
appears sound, although the deep
back trio of Johnny Nolan, Dave
Brooks, and Jimmy Allen are aching
slightly. Brooks has pulled a muscle
while Allen and Nolan are suffiering
from hand injuries. Doug Gossmann,
junior fullback, will not be making
the trip due to a playing knee injury.

Washington University, running
out of a modified “Y” or wishbone
backfield, relies on speedy tailback
Stan Gardner and quarterback
Chuck Daube. Gardner, a freshman,
has consistently been one of the
College Athletic Conference's top 3
rushers. Daube hit on 21 of 52
pass attempts last week in a 36-20
loss to Sewanee. On defense, Wash-
ington employs a basic 4-4 with
much blitzing by the two middle
linebackers,

Kicker Is Unsung Hero

Jack Baizley has probably won
more football games this season than
any other bench-warmer in America

That's a pretty safe statement to
make because no one can disprove
it. Who keeps statistics on such
things?

But the fact is that Jack has won
four games this year for the Wash-
ington and Lee Generals, all of
them with his talented instep

Jack kicks extra points, field goals
and kickoffs for the Generals
Through eight games, he has booted

14 of 14 extra points and added
field goals of 38 and 32 yards.

In W&L’s very first game, Jack's
toe was the difference as the Gen-
erals squeaked by Towson State,
14-13. Against Hampden-Sydney, he
booted WAL into a 14-13 yead,
and the Generals later added an
insurance touchdown. He had four
of WA&L’s 10 points against Bridge-
water, and WAL won by four.

And last week against Southwest

perseverance paid off midway in the
second quarter as their inside right
let go a blistering shot that Goalie
Ken Newman seemed to have under
control, but the ball slipped off his
fingers, arching into the goal. This
was the extent of the scoring in the
first half.

The Generals seemed fired up for
the second half, but thei offense
stalled and stumbled repeatedly,
Meanwhile a perfect corner-kick pro-
duced Randolph-Macon’s — second
goal. The Jackets’ right halfback
beat Newman with a headshot on
the corner-kick, putting the game
hopelessly out of reach.

An R-M_ insurance goal was
scored later in the game as the Gen-
erals continued to struggle to gen-
erate some offense.

Fortunately the NCAA bid did
not ride on the outcome of this
game. The Generals are certainly
capable of much better play, and
the return of Coach Lyles to the
sidelines after a one-game absence
should help tremendously. Spring-
field will be tough, but the soccer
team has come up with the big
win many times this year. Let's hope
they can again in these all-important
tournament games.

also available. Both classes would

The committee recommended in
its report certain scheduling conven-
tions “to dove-tail courses into the
same block-hours and otherwise as-
sist in compressing a large schedule
of classes into a relatively small
number of block-hours.”

After stating ten conventions for
the new schedule the committee add-
ed an eleventh one urging the vari-
ous faculty departments to schedule
their classes “uniformly” within the
scheduled space allotted them and
warned that “the Committee on
Registration and Class Schedules
may disapprove the proposed meet-
ing times for courses of any depart-
ment that fails substantially to
comply with these conventions.

The committee also cited the ad-
vantages and disadvantages of the
schedule in its report:

The major advantages are “a very
large variety of frequency and ura-
tion of class meetings,” “a relatively
high degree of simplicity and regu-
larity in operation,” and avoidance
of “unpopular alternating week and

of victory was five, 24-19.

Actually Jack is a talented quart-
erback with a fine passing arm. But
he’s been used only sparingly in that
post because of the fine job Chuck
Kuhn has been doing. Kuhn is the

he has completed 20 passes for 188
yards and a pair of touchdowns. But
most of the time he is silting on the
bench, until he’s called on to boot
the ball.

“Jack is the unsung hero of our
team, that’s for sure,” said WA&l
head coach Graham (Buck) Leslie.

without him.”

Che committee balanced these ad
vantages against such disadvantages
as the fact that some professors will

have to teach at unpopular hours
such as 8 a.m. or Friday afternoon,
limitations on the number and

character of sections that can meet,
and “somewhat more unevenness of
classwork within the week” for both
faculty and students.

rhe Committee’s report indicated
that these disadvantages stemmed
primarily from a reduction in time
that came with the switch from a
semester to a 12 week term set-up,
and that the scheduling conventions
would work to overcome this.
