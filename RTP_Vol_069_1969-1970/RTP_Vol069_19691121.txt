Foreign Study
Survey Planned

Ihe Foreign Study Committee will
circulate a questionnaire on a pro-
posed foreign study program for the
new six-week term next week, ac-
cording to David B. Dickens, as-
sistant professor of German and
chairman of the committee.

Dickens said he hopes the ques-
tionnaire, which will be distributed
only among freshmen and sopho-
mores, will help the committee esta-
blish opportunities for study in
Europe.

Although the proposed program is
still in the planning stage, Dickens
said he hopes it could be imple-

W&L Presented
Foundation Gift

Washington and Lee University
received a $1500 grant this week
from the Sears-Robuck Foundation.

E. O. Huffman, local representa-
tive of the foundation, said W&L
shared in grants totaling $1.5 mil-
lion which are being distributed to
more than 950 colleges and univer-

sities across the nation by the
foundation.

Southern Seminary Junior Col-
lege in Buena Vista received an

equal grant from the foundation.
Huffman said the funds may be
used by the schools as they see fit.

mented during the next academic
year.

He said Washington and Lee lags
behind in providing foreign study
opportunities for its students.

Students taking part in the pro-
posed program would have to have
an adequate oral command of a
foreign language and a cumulative
grade-point ration of 2.5 or better.

Dickens said an intensive train-
ing program would probably be
established by the University as well.
This program would supplement the
foreign study program and provide
preparation for it.

Dickens discussed present oppor-
tunities for travel and study abroad
at a meeting Wednesday in duPont
Hall.

About 30 students heard him dis-
cuss opportunities for getting jobs in
Europe, living with a foreign fam-
ily, independent travel, and academic
study.

He described study situation con-
ducted by both universities and in-
dependent organizations, including
programs in a number of countries
for an entire year, a semester, or a
summer,

During the meeting he described
the work of the committee as “an
attempt to assist Washington and
Lee students in spending time in
Europe in both academic and non-
academic situations.”

$1200 Center Budget
Approved by Huntley

The annual budget for the Uni-
versity Center, submitted by the Uni-
versity Center Committee to Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley, has been
approved.

The budget includes $1000 for en-
tertainment in the Cockpit and $200
for the creation of a new lounge.

Under the leadership of chairmen
Bill Gottwald and John Miller, the
Center Committee plans to use its
entertainment funds to provide a
number of free weekend combos in
the Cockpit over the remainder of
the year.

The new lounge which the budget
provides for will be located in rooms
112-113, across from the TV room.
The lounge will be designed for in-
formal meetings and such activities
as a trial coffee house several eve-
nings a week

The center is also purchasing cof-
fee urns so that coffee can be made
available for student meetings. A
minimal charge will be made for
groups of more than 20 members.
Coffee can be arranged through Ken
Lane, University Center Director.

During the second semester, the
Committee is planning a series of
faculty-siudent coffee hours in the
Cenier library. The purpose of the
meeting will be to give students,
especially freshman and sophomores,
the chance to meet professors in
each academic department. Profes-
sors and student majors will De in-

Joseph A. Presel, State Department official, discusses disarmament with
WA&L students at a YR meeting held last Tuesday.

Disarming Said Unlikely

By ROGER MUNSICK
Associate News Editor

State Department official Joseph
A. Presel termed disarmament “ex-
ceedingly unlikely” and painted a
grim picture of the frusirations of
high level negotiations before an
audience of Washington and Lee stu-
dents and guests Tuesday night.

Presel’s speech on “Is Disarma-
ment Possible?” was sponsored
jointly by the W&L Young Republi-
cans and the Political Science Club
and International Relations Associa-
tion.

Presel opened his discussion with
a brief history of movements in dis-
armament, dating from the Middle
Ages, but having their modern
origins in a conference at the Hague
in 1899.

He dealt briefly with attempts to
limit naval power in the 1930s, with
the ill-fated Baruch plan of 1946,
with the Atoms for Peace proposals
of the Eisenhower administration,
and with the nuclear negotiations of
the past decade.

Presel also noted the presence of
disarmament talks in non-nuclear
phases of warfare, citing the current

Broadus To Head Group

A Knoxville. Tenn.. businessman
has been appointed chairman of the
Robert E. Lee Associates of Wash-
ington and Lee University by the
university's Board of Trustees, Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley an-
nounced today.

Thomas H. Broadus, owner of
Thomas Broadus & Co., Agents, a
general insurance agency, sticceeds
David D. Johnson, a Pittsburgh, Pa
industrialist who has served during
the past year as the first chairman of
the Associates.

The Robert E. Lee Associates
organization is composed of persons
whose support of Washington and
Lee has been exceptionally gener-
ous, There are currently almost 200
members.

The Associates program was
iMitiated in 1968 by the trustees to
recognize and honor Washington and
Lee's most loyal benefactors

President Huntley noted that “The

velopment program

“It is good to know thai a per-
son of Mr. Broadus’ ability will be
carrying on the work led so ably
during the Associates’ first year by
Mr. Johnson,” he added.

Broadus is a 1925 graduate of
Washington and Lee. and he re
ceived his M.B.A. from Harvard
University in 1931. He is married

Presel said, and any progress in the
field will be “slow, imprecise, and
not immediately obvious.”

During this interval, the State De-

questions concerning the deployment
of nuclear weapons.

_ Committee Eyes

- Advisory System,

Suggests Change

By MIKE HOUCK
Staff Reporter

[he Student Curriculum Commit-
tee has submitted a report to the
Faculty Curriculum Committee
which recommends an overhaul of
the present freshman advisory sys-
tem.

Under the proposed plan a com-
mittee would be appointed by Uni-
versity President Robert E. R. Hunt-
ley to supervise the recruitment of
faculty advisors and the assignment
of advisers.

This committee would include
Dean of Students Lewis G. John,
Dean Edward C. Atwood of the
School of Commerce, Economics,
and Politics, Director of Admissions
James D. Farrar, Dean of the Col-
lege.

Should the proposed plan be
adopted, the new committee would
be labeled the University Advisory
Committee. Its goal would be to im-
prove the effectiveness of the ad-
visory system by the inclusion of
administration, faculty, an dstudent
points of view.

The Student Curriculum Commit-
tee also proposed that the “interest

inventory forms” suggested by Dr.
Henry S. Roberts, professor of bi-
ology, be implemented. These forms
would be sent to new students im-
mediately upon receipt of their let-
ters of acceptance. The information
gained would serve as an aid to the
appointment of faculty advisors.

It was also suggested in the re-
port that “The first contact between
the freshman and his advisor should
be on a social basis, rather than the
current businesslike encounter.” The
committee hopes this would “pro-
vide for a broader and more pro-
ductive relationship between the ad-
visor and advisee.”

The committee also recommended
that student advisory panels be
organized. These panels would equ-
ally represent the divisions of the
University, and would be composed
of two representatives from each de-
partment,

They would operate both in fall
and spring registration and be under
the control of the Student Curri-
culum Commitee. Their chief func-
tion would be the provision of re-
sponsible student advice with regard
to the curriculum.

School of Commerce,
Divisions Renamed

The 63-year-old School of Com-
merce and Administration has been
renamed the School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics.

Dr. Edward C. Atwood, Jr., dean
of the school, said, “The name was
changed in order to reflect accur-
ately the modern scope of offerings
m the school and the school's role
in higher education.”

Debaters Elect Wright

Tim Wright, a Washington and
Lee junior from Houston, Texas,
has been unanimously elected stu-
dent president of the four-state re-
gion of the Delta Sigma Rho—Tau
Kappa Alpha Forensic Fraternity
Conference.

The election occurred at a
ference tournament at Bridgewater
College last weekend. Included in
th region are the states of Virginia,
Wst Virginia. Maryland, and Dela-
ware, plus the District of Columbia

In addition, Wright won the top

had its first losing tournament of
the school year at Mark Grobmver,
Bob Muni. Lee Harriss and Tim
Junkin won just two of eight de-
butes.

Approval of the name change was
given by the University Board of
Trustees.

Dr. Lewis W. Adams, who fe-
tired from administrative duties
July 1 after 20 years as dean of

the commerce school, had proposed
that the School of Commerce, Eco-
nomics and Politics would be a be-
fiting mame for the school, Dean
Atwood noted.

In addition, twe name changes in
departments within the school were
approved:

—The Department of Commerce
has been redesignated the Depart-
ment of Administration.

—The Department of Political
Science has been redesignated the
Department of Politics.

All three changes resulted from
the University’s self-study of 1964-
66. from faculty discussions, from
talks with interested students and
alumni, and from consideration at
the administrative level.

“It seemed important to maintain
the historical identity of the School
of Commerce for which our alumni
and students bear respect, loyalty,
and devotion, and the establishment
of which brought the realization of

General Lee's dream.” Dr. Adams
said.

“Alt the same time. it is most
fitting to give recognition to the

wishes of the faculties and to the
graduates of the deparimenits of
economics and politics

“Moreover, the title Departmen!
of Administration corresponds with
current usage and connotes more
precisely the aims and character of
our present curriculum.” the retired
dean said,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Colvin Presents “Issue-Oriented” Views

(Editor's Note: The following interview is a

transcription of a taped conversation with W&L

Professor of Political Science, Milton Colvin,

Friday staff member, Monty Cottier talked with

Professor Colvin last Wednesday of his inten-

tions to run for the U.S. Senate against Senator

Byrd.)

The Friday Ring-tum Phi: What, basically, is your plat-
form?

Dr. Milton Colvin: Well, I took the position in the
Moratorium talks, as regards to the Vietnam issue, that
1 was in favor of a withdrawal from Vietnam, but
I did not want that to be a precipitous withdrawal, I
wanted to protect the troops that We have there and
protect our allies and give South Vietnam a fighting
chance to put together a good government.

And I might say, incidentally, that | do not consider
the present government in South Vietnam to meet that
standard. And, I want to protect us from all the
political demigogues and adventurers who would be
crying beterayal and treason if we were to have this
withdrawal. So, in a sense I support the President's
position on the method of withdrawal, but I do differ
with him on one point, and it is a major point: | want
it to be a total withdrawal. | am opposed to keeping
logistical support of, say, 100 or 200 thousand men
behind in Vietnam. When we get oul, we should get
out entirely.

There are many other stands that are important,
but, basically speaking, | would say that I am issue-
oriented, I think that the people of the United States
want to hear facts, they want to hear common sense,
they recognize that nobody has all the answers, but
they at least want somebody who'll level with them.
They want an end to the credibility gap, if you will,
I'm simply talking common sense to the common
people. That's Adlai Steven's phrase, and I think it's
a pretty good one,

R-t Phi: Then would you say that you differ sub-
stantially from Senator Byrd?

Colvin: | think | differ with Senator Byrd on almost
every issue; | would say EVERY issue, but I noticed
in his recent newspaper statement that he opposed
eranting higher salaries to incumbent senators, and I
also support that position. | think they're well-enough
paid as it is.

But, in general, I think there's a fundamental disa-
greement down the line. I believe that his position has
been a reactionary position; I believe that he has
favored the wealthy at the expense of the rest of us,
I believe that he has been destructive in education, both
in the state of Virginia and nationally, and I believe
that he is a man who looks backward rather than
forward. It’s a pretty fundamental disagreement.

R-t Phi: Do you think Senator Byrd will go ahead and
seek the nomination?

Colvin: I'm assuming that the full-page ad which ap-
peared in the major newsapapers yesterday is an indica-
tion that he will seek the nomination, and that he
will stay in the Democratic party. Of course, this ad
was put in by his supporters and was not a statement
from Senator Byrd himself. And that means, of course,
that he could decide to withdraw from the race or
go over into the Republican party. But I don’t believe
that he will do so, As I indicated in another interview,
my Republican friends tell me they don’t want him.
But | think whatever the Byrds may do, you have to
give them credit for courage. They won't run from a
fight, and I think he will take all comers in the Demo-
cratic primary. But I think I can give him the best
fight of any challenger

R-t Phi: Do you think that the election of Linwood
Holton will make the Republican party in Virginia a
party to be dealt with?

Colvin: | think it will, because Mr. Holton is a politi-
cal moderate. and | know him personally. He's a
friend, and | admire him. He brings leadership to the
Republican party in Virginia, and | think it’s worth
noting that his running mate, | am speaking of his
candidate for attorney-general, fell by the wayside and
took a more conservative stand, and I think it's quite
clear that even Virginia Republicans are only going to
back moderates.

R-t Phi: If you win the nomination and election, do you
plan to go ahead in politics?

Colvin: Oh, I'd eventually return to teaching. You
know, I am the third straight generation of university
professors in my family. My father taught in many
places, including WAL, and my grandfather taught
almost forty years at Amherst. | suppose, that in some
way or another the university is my natural habitat.

1 am primarily entering this race for the purpose
of bringing these issues to the American public and
to defeat the Byrd machine. I'm not going there to
educate anybody, I'm going there to win. But I don't

An Alternative To Byrd

It is obvious to us that Sen. Byrd owes his office to the
power of his father’s name and the machine he created, and
he has used his position merely to espouse a political philoso-

phy that is no longer tenable, if it ever was.

But Prof. Colvin's opposition is not merely negative, as
his remarks above indicate. He seems to deal with the most
important problems in a manner at once creative, intelligent
and forthright, attributes which Sen. Byrd has been either
unable or unwilling to summon to aid him in his duties since

he took offic e.

Realizing that Prof. Colvin was not looking primarily for
an endorsement from the Ring-tum Phi when he announced
his intention to test public sentiment on his candidacy, we
nonetheless believe that Sen. Byrd has not been the man to
deal with the crucial problems Virginia faces, and that Prof,
Colvin's moderate stance seems to point the way to progress
for this state Therefore we encourage his candidac Vv and hope

that the voters of Virginia iwll do likewise.

foresee a career in politics, it doesn’t interest me. As
a matter of fact, I'm a Jeffersonian, and I happen to
believe that the Senator should only serve two terms,
and the Congressman only six terms,

R-t Phi: In an earlier interview you mentioned that
you were thinking of running and you wanted to gauge
the opinions of the constituency about your candidacy.
How would you do this?

Colvin: Well, this involves two things: First, | have to
show that I have enough support so that I will be taken
as a serious candidate. As you know, there are several
other people who have announced that they plan to
run against Senator Byrd. | do not think that that’s
an exhausted list, 1 expect other people to be making
announcements in the next few days, I have to demon-
strate to voters and potential voters that I am _ the
candidate to follow and that the others are NOT
candidates to follow.

Then the second part of the equation comes into
play. Only when I have momentum, only when I have
support, can I ask people to contribute money. Now,
this is a Campaign that is going to be very expensive,
even though I will do everything possible to keep the
expenses down. For this, we need money.

The support comes first, and hopefully the money
comes second. If I do not get the support, or the money,

then | shall not run. But | am assuming that I will
get the support; indeed, I've spent the last two days
talking to people across the state, telephone lines have
been constantly busy, letters have been coming in. I
thing there's no question but that there is a considerable
amount of support available.

Incidentally, and I say this with considerable pride,
support is coming from both sides of the line. | am
pleased and delighted with the number of Republicans
who say, “You can count on me all the way down
the line.” This is really quite cheering. Now, the money

. well, we'll have to wait a little bit.

R-t Phi: Where do you think your greatest support lies
among the voters?
Colvin: Well, | think I'm a candidate in search of sup-
port. | am hoping that I'll find it across the board, Or,
to put it another way, I do not concede any group, or
groups, to anyone else. | must concede Senator Byrd
HIS own group, but nobody else. This is another way
of saying that I seek support among the young people
in the state. | would seek support among the old people
who are worried about the rising cost of illness or
hospital care, because | have taken a position in favor
of some form of national health insurance, which would
alleviate something of that cost.

An Answer To
"Woodstock Revisited’

lo the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi:

The article in the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi titled “Nov. 15: Woodstock
Revisited” is a gross misrepresenta-
tion of the events during the March
on Washington, The article states
that the “biggest party since this
summer was held in Washington
over the weekend, and as usual
where parties are concerned, WAL
was well represented.”

Although some students, no doubt,
went up to see the Episcopal football
game and decided to drop in on the
March, it is utterly illogical to
judge the November 13-15 activities
from the point of view of the typi-
cally unconcerned, fun seeking WAL
student

The March was not party. If you
could have seen the determination
and solemnity on the faces of the
marchers (during both the March
Against Death and the Mass March),
you would know that the hundreds
of thousands were not there to have
fun. They were showing Mr. Nixon
that they want the U.S. to get out
of Vietnam. Now! Continued chants

support from thinking businessmen, but most of all,
1 would expect support from those who resent the
long domination of the Byrd family here in Virginia
and who seek to break out of it.

I am a moderate, and I think most Virginians are
moderates, When you ask where I'll get the support,
I'll go after it everywhere.

R-t Phi: You've mentioned briefly the young people.
Do you think being a college professor will help your
campaign?

Colvin: I think it will now. | think we can thank the
late Adlai Stevenson and John Kennedy for this. I
think that 10 or 15 years ago it would have been dis-
advantageous to be a university professor, but it is
advantageous today.

I think that people know now that a_ university
professor is not an egghead, that he is a man of prob-
lems, with plumbing and a house that needs fixing,
with children to educate, dogs to get licenses for; he’s
a human being, he’s not a strange, ivory-tower person.
Moreover, I think there’s an emphasis, and a_ proper
emphasis in this country on education today.

Many people I know are encouraging their sons and
daughters to go into the field of education. It is not
only a respectable profession, it is also an attractive
profession.

R-t Phi: How effective do you think student campaign-
ers were in the last gubernatorial race, and do you
plan to use them?

Colvin: | think that they were effective, but they could
be made much more effective. | hope to have stronger
student support than the candidates for governor got,
because the students are more concerned with national
issues. After all, in the last analysis, these students are
not as concerned with revenue issues in the state of
Virginia as with issues such as Vietnam, arms, or civil
rights, So that's part of the answer.

The other part is that | can probably create more
student support than either of the gubernatorial candi-
dates.

R-+t Phi: If Senator Byrd were to run again, how
effective do you think his political machine would be,
and do you think it would be sufficient to defeat a col-
lege professor?

Colvin: Well, there is no question that the Byrd ma-
chine is efficient. It's based upon a principle that is no
longer viable. This principle was, essentially, keeping
people away from the polls. When you had a small
turnout, a small but efficient organization could carry
the day. But now, you're having a large turnout; you
had almost 900 thousand people in the last election,
so that a small, efficent organization is not as good as
a BIG efficient organization.

Moreover, the senator is simply not the man that
his father was. His father was a titanic figure in Vir-
ginia politics. You didn’t have to agree with him, and
I come from a long line of people who did not, but
I think you have to recognize that his father was a
personality.

The senator is really a mediocre senator, without,
I think, any great personal following; I think that a
good deal of the following that he has is, essentially,
a legacy passed on to him by his father. We're talking
about two entirely different men when we talk about
Harry Byrd Jr, and Harry Byrd Sr. Moreover, he’s
five feet, six inches tall, and I’m six feet, and that’s
good six inch spread.

Rt- Phi: If you were elected, would you favor the
reduction of defense spending?

Colvin: Yes, | do favor the reduction, Now, let me
say something very bluntly on that. | do not minimize
the Soviet threat, or the Communist threat, and I
recognize that we cannot accomplish anything unless
we are secure from that threat, so I’m certainly not
talking about dismantling the armed services.

But I think that the defense budget is a bloated
budget. I think that in the Pentagon they take in each
other’s laundry, I think you could cut the defense
budget, not by the $2 billion which Sen. Byrd has
proposed, but a good, healthy cut would come in the
neighborhood of $12 billion.

R-t Phi: And this money, you feel, could be better
spent elsewhere?

Colvin: That's right. Cleaning up our cities, cleaning
up our rivers, making our air fit to breathe, providing
programs to train young men now idle because of
lack of skills, giving educational opportunities to those
who don’t have them; there's a host of things that
could be done with it.

R-t Phi: Since we brought up, a little earlier, the ques-
tion of student involvement in the campaign, how could
we help?

Colvin: Well, there are a lot of ways in which students
could help. I'm willing to talk to Young Republicans,
Young Democrats, Young Independents, anybody who's
willing to listen. Once these people have been talked
to, if they're willing to be a part of the campaign,
they can help by writing letters, they can talk to friends,
if they're not registered voters, they can talk to people
who are, they can work with student groups on other
campuses, they can collect money, any kind of money
they can get.

Let me be quite clear about that: as long as there
are no strings attached, I'll take money from anybody,
Somebody asked me the other day if I would take
money from out of state. I certainly would. As long
as there are no obligations on my part to a commit-
ment, I'll take as much as I can get.

I tend to think there is a feeling in Virginia that
we need a shift, we need a change, I think Holton
articulated that position very well, and I tend to think
that this movement is pretty much on a bipartisan path.
R-t Phi: Then, if the students accept this and go out
and work, how effective do you think they could be?
Colvin: I think they'd be enormously effective. They
could talk to people, they could persuade people. In
a sense, they would be messengers or forerunners. |
never underestimate them. I'd rather have students on
my side than any other group.

R-t Phi: Do you think there would be any problem with
older voters if students were employed in the campaign?
Colvin: Sure, there will be some people who resent it,
but I wouldn't worry about it. There's lots of things
that will happen; you're going to alienate people as
you go along. I think one of the things that you can’t
afford to do is to loose any sleep over, or even worry
about, things like that. If people are against you,
they're against you. We'll level with the people, we'll
talk sense, and we'll let them make their decision.

R-t Phi: When do you have to decide whether or not
you are going to run?

Colvin: T'll have to decide within thirty days at the
very latest. | need all the help | can get now, to build
up support, so that | can then really ron

R-t Phi: How does it look now?

Colvin: Well, people have been coming in all day long,
saying “Here's the good news, here's the bad news.”
We've had some setbacks, but in general it looks very
good, I've gotten responses across the state: from Bristol
to Winchester, and from Covington to the Washington
suburbs, So, f think it’s going, and it'll 20 quite well
To some degree, we don't know who else is in the
race, and we'll have to allow for that, but I'm not at
all disheartened by it

R-t Phi: When should the studenis get out and help?
Colvin: Right now. The time is today: as a matter of
fact, were late! What we need now is enthusiasm
unbridled, boundless enthusiasm—spred across the state.

Another Side of The
‘Newman-Shirk’ Debate

To the Editor, Friday Ring-tum Phi

lt takes a sophomore, Everett
Newman, 72, to expound on life,
liberty and happiness while being
cute, sarcastic, and sophomoronish

Regardless of all subterfuge
“dress” and “speak” at WAL which
have rapidly degenerated to ugh!
should be reinstated for these rea
sons: (1) they are manifestations of

discipline, especially self-discipline,
(2) they look a helluva lot better
to everybody than the opposite, and
alumni and friends are going to con
tribute more money when things
look better than they do now, and
(3) they are educational—vyes, Fy
erett Newman, ‘72, there is more
to education than you will get from
academic subjects

Looking sloppy and nol speaking
are certainly not being different. I:
is being lazy, uncouth, and dirty
and | am in favor of eliminating
uny such crud from WAL. The
excuse for not doing it is
Ness Of past adminisirations and

nothing but LO

When the first student took it off
several years ago on a

but that started it. One step led to
another and we have a school of

Where does breakdown of discipline

That is why the trend should be
reversed NOW! It would be easy to

Swim Team Shows Promise

Yesterday afternoon, the Generals’
natators faced their first preliminary

test of the year. They swam _ the
VMI Keydets in a “scrimmage.”
Coach Stearns said that he was

“well pleased with the performances,
his is the best we've done this early
in the season.”

Fomorrow afternoon at 2:30 p.m
the Generals face in their home pool
the Briarwood Raquet and Paddle

Club’s swimming team in another
“scrimmage.” The Briarwood club is
one of the top AAU swimming

teams in the Virginia area and is
coached by Norris Eastman, Coach
Stearns’s predecessor at the helm of
the W&L team

There is no score kept in these

swimming scrimmages and there is
no official time. Coach Stearns has
made the VMI scrimmage a regular
seasonal event. Any number of
swimmers can participate in a given
event, and furthermore, this is the
first time during the year that the
Generals are able to swim in a 25
yard pool,

There were several exceptional
times registered at the VMI scrim-
mage. Sophomore Bim Clark swam
a 100 yard dolphin butterfly with
a split time of 56.3 seconds. Bill
Brumback registered a 23.0 seconds
and 52.3 seconds in the 50 and 100
yard events. These equal the times
he was setting very late in the sea-

THE RING-TUM PHI

Speaking My Mind

The Springfield Road

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

You're sitting back in your seat
on the bus. For good reason the
ride home from Springfield, Mass.
and its NCAA tournament seems
much longer and lonelier than the
journey north two days before,
brimming with enthusiasm, anticipa-
tion, and hope. It will be reported
that your boys were outscored 18-0
over the weekend. Too bad. It was a
better season than that.

It started back in early September.
You knew that the team was full of
gaping holes, especially in the line.
Ten players had been lost from last
year’s squad due to graduation and
other academic reasons. In addition
the freshmen team had not been
good the previous year, leaving you
only one place to find the bulk of
your new team, this year’s incoming
freshmen. Thus Meade Kampfmuel-
ler, Brandon Herbert, and Hank
Slauson, looking very good in prac-
tice were quickly inserted into key
positions on the starting team.

You could not be extremely op-
timistic when the season started. In-
experience was the main ingredient
working against your expectations.

But the Blues rallied in the first
game to whip Pfeiffer 4-2, and in the
following week lambasted both
Hampden-Sydney and Madison. The
freshmen were coming through in
great style, the fullbacks had _ be-
come a hardnosed, aggressive unit,
and halfback Carl Hyatt was doing
everything, scoring goals and play-
ing good defense. You actually had
a good team on your hands.

But Virginia beat the Generals.
Defeat was sudden and maybe lucky;
however, you could not allow the
team to let up, for powerful Lynch-
burg was only three days away.
Goalie Ken Newman pulled the team
through that one, making many ex-
cellent saves. A tie was welcome
after having been thoroughly out-
played.

The road to Springfield was paved
for the Blues, though, in the next
game, against Roanoke. You came
out on top, beating the state champs!
It was the turning point of the sea-
son,

The team seemingly could do no
wrong now. They trounced a strugg-
ling VMI, 4-0. Against Eastern Men-
nonite John Yow put in a last sec-

They were chosen by their team-

Generals wound up thir 1969 cam-

Paul Wilber and Dave Haydu for

team, ran 2nd against Lynchburg,
3rd against tough Eastern Mennon-
ite, 4th against Bridgewater, Sth
against Roanoke and Old Dominion
in a tri-meet, and Sth against Cen-
tre. In the College Athletic Confer-
ence Meet, Wilkinson placed 7th;
he finished 42nd in a field of 115 in
the state meet, the top spot for a
General runner this year.

Sherwood surprised many by plac-
ing first against Lynchburg. He fol-
lowed with a Sth place finish versus
Eastern Mennonite, 6th against
Bridgewater, 4th against Roanoke
and Old Dominion, and 3rd against
Centre.

Washington and Lee opened the
season with a 24-35 victory over
Lynchburg. In the tri-meet, the Gen-
erals lost to Roanoke 41-40 but de-
feated Old Dominion 41-42. Wash-
ington and Lee then dropped three
decisons, to Centre 31-24, Eastern
Mennonite 33-22 and Bridgewater
42-18. The Generals added their
third victory with a 15-50 forfeit
victory over Fairmont. In CAC com-
petition, the Blue Harriers tied for
third place with Southwestern. Each
had 91 points in a meet won by
Washington University of St. Louis.

The State Meet was held this year
at Washington and Lee. In accord-
ance with State rules, the course was
lengthened to five miles. The Gen-
erals finished ninth with 240 points
in the twelve team field.

Howell Michael of meet-winning

a good one, despite his lack of size
(he’s 5-10 and 180 pounds). At the
beginning of this season W&L head
Coach Graham (Buck) Leslie said
Ogilvie “could be one of the finest
guards W&L ever had.”

Kumpuris is also light (170, 6-0)
for the position he plays, defensive
linebacker, but his quickness makes
up for it. During W&L’s nine-game
season he was credited with 57 indi-
vidual tackles and 26 assists, an
average of more than nine a game.

For both boys it is the completion

of a “brother act.” Ogilvie’s older
brother, Buck, was captain of the
1963 W&L football team. Drew

Kumpuris’s brother, Dean, was cap-
tain of the 1969 squad.

Kumpuris is a biology major from
Little Rock, Ark. He is an honor
roll and dean’s list student and ac-
tive in a number of campus activi-
ties, including serving as sports edi-
tor of the yearbook,

Ogilvie, a commerce major from
Shreveport, La., ranks 19th aca-
demically in his class of 280. He is
a dean’s list student and has served
for two years as an elected member
of the student government executive
committee.

well that your boys could not afford

there were two hard road games that
