THE RING-TUM PHI

 

THE RING-TUM PHI

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper
Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Edition

Tuesday, December 9, 1969

Do we lack curiosity?

In his recently published ‘College Confidential’ Law-
rence Handel states, “there is one thing that the Washington
and Lee student lacks— intellectual curiosity.”

Tracing this intellectual void to the fraternity system,
Handel charges, “‘(it) enables the students to spend their
extra time imbibing in one of the eighteen houses on camp-
us.”

We all realize the absurdity of Mr. Handel’s conclusion.
On Wednesday there will be an opportunity to demonstrate
that W&L is in fact more than an incubator for the AA. We
can ostensibly prove to any Mr. Handel that we are an aca-
demic community and that we are not totally devoid of the
powers of thought.

Tomorrow the Student Curriculum Committee will con-
duct a referendum to ascertain general sentiment on an in-
dependent exam schedule. We are thinking about this but we
must tell the faculty along what lines we are thinking.

The 12-12-6 calendar necessarily curtails the number of
testing days for final exams. If we fail to illustrate our over-
all desire for the creation of an independent schedule, the
faculty may possibly vote in retrogressive legislative action to
return to a schedule of two exams per day. If we really are
intellectually “out of it”, we may quite fairly be nailed to the
wall by an exam schedule dictated by mechanical technicali-
ties.

The faculty has a number of times exhibited its open
willingness to listen to the voices of the student body and to
incorporate our desires in new policies. The faculty knows the
opinion of the Executive Committee and The Ring-tum Phi,
but they need to know everyone’s feeling on this matter.

At the present time we are the only college in Virginia
with an effective honor system that does not enjoy the fruits
of independent scheduling of examinations. Through the
honor system we have repeatedly proven our “gentlemanly”
and thoughtful ability to handle situations analogous to an
independent exam schedule.

Let’s again show we have the capacity to use our heads.
Let’s demonstrate the fact that our desire to see a rational
exam schedule supercedes any hangovers. Let’s prove our
intellectual curiosity.

Proving our curtosity
Cc -

“Esse quam videri’’ reads an ancient maxim. Unfor-
tunately, many prospective applicants may never journey to
Lexington. Rather than learning what “we are” first-hand,
these people must “see” second-hand information before
they formulate a mental picture of W&L.

We earnestly hope that Mr. Handel’s portrait of General
Lee’s college is not consulted as a reliable reference. Need-
less to say, we call into question his conclusions—obviously
that is all they are. We now must actively engage ourselves in
proving, especially to interested high school students, the
falseness of Handel’s “confidential” information.

Fortunately, on December 1 the faculty chalked a positive
entry on our balance sheet. By approving the exchange pro-
gram, they displayed that amenity to innovation frequently
disclosed in the past two years by students, faculty and ad-
ministrators alike.

The exchange program, besides its attractiveness to ap-
plicants in more objective statistical profilese—Dean Farrar
reported in the Friday Edition that 36%, of those freshmen
accepted but who did not enter last year did so because they
preferred a coeducational institution—indicates the general
desire here to satisfy intellectual curiosity by experimenting.
Certainly, one of our biggest immediate questions is co-
education. One of the many benefits of the exchange pro-
gram should be to provide, or to assist in locating, some an-
swers to this problem.

The independent exam proposal

By Chip Schooley

Curriculum Committee
In September Washington and
Lee will implement the sweeping

changes in curriculum proposed by
the Faculty Curriculum Committee
last spring. This change will affect
not only courses and distribution re-
quirements, but the University cal-
endar as well.

In October a calendar was adopt-
ed by the faculty which allows six
days for examinations at the end of
the fall twelve week term and eight
days for examinations at the end of
the spring twelve week term. Al-
though the normal load will be four
courses rather than five, these ex-
amination periods are a marked
condensation when compared to the
present eleven day periods,

If examinations continue to be
scheduled, it is likely that morning
and afternoon examinations will be
necessary. The other alternative is
an Independent Examination Sche-
dule. There are currently no plans
on the part of any committee of the
faculty or the administration to in-
vestigate the feasibility of such a
program. In view of the decisive de-
feat of the proposal last year, this
is not surprising, however.

It is the feeling of the Student
Curriculum Committee and the Stu-
dent Body Executive Committee that
these shortened examination  per-
iods necessitate another considera-
tion of an independent or semi-in-
dependent examination program.

One major stumbling block in
the implementation of an Indepen-
dent Examination Schedule has in

Hilliard disputes Spiro’s theology

both offer ten commandments

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

Vice President Spiro Agnew has
presented the country with what he
calls the ten commandments of pro
test. The ten commandments, ac-
cording to the Vice President, in-
clude such gems as:

“Thou shalt not
ponent to speak.”

“Thou shalt not honor thy mother
or thy father.”

“Thou shalt not revere any but
totalitarian heroes.”

“Thou shalt not ask forgiveness
for thy transgressions, rather thou
shalt demand amnesty for them.”

Isn't the Vice-President clever? I
guess Agnew is saying that the more
than one million people who took
part in the October 15 Moratorium
on the Vietnam War are anarchists,
communists, and hate their parents
My mother should be glad to know
that

Well, if Agnew can make up a
list of ten commandments for pro
1 guess | can have poet
license to draw up the ten command
ments for Spiro T. Agnew, so here
pues

Thou

tesiors,

shalt not think  belore

Thou shalt not countenance erit:
cism, rather thou shalt brand al!
protestors as traitors

Thou shalt enjoy the tasie of shoe

Thou shall go to any extreme to
make thyself a household word

Thou shalt do and say exucily as
Richard Nixon preaches

Thou shalt accept any Pstablish
ment idea without questioning

Thou shall not trust anvbody un
der WO ercept David Eiwenhowe:
and especially your own daughter

Thou shalt condemn any hody
living in Washington or New York

Thou shalt polarize public opinion
as best you can.

That's nine commandments for
the Vice President. Since one of his
commandments for protestets is:
“Thou shalt not

him is:

Foreign Study
Committee seeks
needed answers

Some time ago the Foreign Study
Commitice announced its intention
to ask freshmen and sophomores for
their assistance with the committee's
own interest in developing a foreign
study program for Washington and
Lee

\ questionnaire will be presented
on Wednesday, and all freshmen and
sophomores are asked to take a few
minutes of their time to provide an
swers to the questions it asks, Tables
with the questionnaire will be locat
ed in Evans Dining Hall, in front of
Washington Hall, and on the first
floor of DuPont Hall

the Committee hopes for a good
response to its questionnaire so that
it can be guided by student opinions
as Ht continues tO exXamine the en
lire question of a foreign study pro
gram for the University

The questionnaire is directed at
freshmen and sophomores because
they will be in the best siltation to
take advantage of any foreien studs

the past been lack of confidence in
the Honor System on the part of
the faculty. In an effort to assess the
confidence of the student body in
the Honor System, especially in the
context of an Indepenednt Examina-
tion Schedule, the Student Curti-
culum Committee and the Student
Body Executive Committee are spon-
soring a referendum tomorrow in
which two questions will appear on
the ballot:

Do you feel that an Independent

Examination Schedule would pose

an unwarranted burden on_ the

Honor System?

Do you favor the establishment

of a system whereby a_ student

has the option of scheduling his

own examinations?

The two questions may seem un-
necessarily broad, but it is our feel-

ing that unless students are confid
ent that the Honor System can sup-
port an independent examination
schedule, any investigation of the
details of such a schedule would be
meaningless. If students voice sup
port for an independent examina
tion schedule, and further, feel that
the Honor System is strong enough
to support it, the Student Curriculum
Committee and the Student Body
Executive Committee will move for
ward in the drafting of a proposal
for admission to the faculty.

I would like to emphasize that
the first question should not be an
swered lightly. An independent ex
amination schedule will require con
stant awareness on the part of the
students that every examination
taken remains hot until the final day
of the examination period.

Students will have to exercise
great care not to discuss any ex-
amination with anyone else, whether
he be enrolled in the course or not.
The reason for this is obvious; a
casual discussion at hand about an
examination taken a few minutes
earlier might be overheard by some
one in the course. The student is
then faced with the dilemma of
whether he should go to the pro
fessor and tell him what he acci-
dently heard, or whether he should
make an effort not to have his stu
dies influenced by the new informa
tion along these lines.

I would also like
that “information” about an ex
amination may be obtained from
seemingly innocuous comments. I
should be made clear that such for
bidden information inciudes not only
the actual material on the quiz, but
also such things as length, degree of
difficulty, and format.

The adoption of a system where
by a student has the option of sche
duling his own examination is not
as simple as it may seem, The Cur
riculum Committee feels that with
the shortened examination periods,
fair scheduling of examinations will
be quite a problem.

The only alternative to the rev
sion to a two-a-day examination sys
tem, as we see it, is the adoption of
some form of independent schedule
We do not wish to make any pro
posals along these lines, however,
unless students are confident that
the Honor System is sufficiently re
liable to support such a program
If the student body responds al
firmatively to both questions to
morrow, we will work toward some
independent examination proposal
If the faculty then turns down the
proposal on the basis of lack of
confidence in the Honor System
they will in effect be saying “We are
protecting you from yourselves.’

I have attempted to outline the
reasons for tomorrow's referendum
and the thought behind it. | would
like to encourage all students to
respond honestly to the two ques
tions posed.

Washington and Lee swimmers The player of the dite
washed out 69-35 by American

the Washington and Lee swimm-
ing team got off to a poor start this
season losing to American Univer-

ty by a decisive 69-35 margin. The
Generals were only able to capture
two individual firsts and one relay
event as the American
dominated the meet.

Alan Corwith, freshman free
styler, captured one of the two firsts
in the 200 yard freestyle event with
the excellent time of 1:55.0 seconds
which is within one second of the
school record. Bim Clark won the
200 yard butterfly setting a new
school and CAC conference record
of 2:12.5. Clark and Corwith com-
bined with Bill Brumback and co-
captain Roger Martin to win the last
event, the 400 yard freestyle relay
with a 3:28.7 second time.

The American depth also limited
the blue natators to only three sec-
ond place finishes. Brumback was
touched out by A.U.’s Brazilian im
port Jose Aranha in the 50 yard
freestyle. The finish was so close, it
required a judge’s decision before
the results were known; Aranha is
considred the 7th best freestyler in

swimmers

the world. Diver Ray Hammond
tallied 114,45 points, falling 20
points behind the A.U. diver, The
final W&L second place finisher
was Aven Sharp who scored a sec-
ond in the 200 yard breaststroke.

his Saturday, the General’s open
at home against Dickinson College.
This is the first time the Generals
have competed against Dickinson
which boasts an All-American
breaststroker and should be a close
meet. A week from Thursday, the
natators will host to Catholic Uni-
versity—a team Coach Stearns has
yet to beat. Next to the University
of Virginia meet after Christmas,
these are two of the toughest dual
meets that the natators’ will have
to face this year.

The J.V. swimming team yester-
day afternoon handily defeated
Staunton Military Academy by a
63-31 margin. The W&L swimmers
held the Staunton team to only three
firsts in the entire meet.

Is Texas number one?

By Thunder Thornton

Although President Nixon has
made his choice of the number one
college football team for his cen
tennial season, this writer still has
some doubts. The Longhorns of
coach Darrell Royal admittedly de
feated a fine Arkansas team to win
the covered plaque, but at least one

Initial basketball home encounter
a tremendous win over Rollins

By Roy Carlton

The sounds of bouncing basket
balls and cheering crowds returned
to Doremus Gym Saturday night as
Washington and 1969 hard-
court team opened its home season
by mauling a highly touted Rollins
squad, 84-62. The victory closed out
the Generals’ first week of play and

Lee's

left them with a 2-1 record. A loss
to Randolph-Macon in Ashland
started the season off on a rocky

path, but the Generals quickly re-
covered by butchering Bridgewater
Thursday night by a 102-87 margin

The Rollins team which appeared
at W&L on Saturday came with all
the right credentials, All five starters
and eight lettermen returned from a
team which had gone 16-10 last year
against difficult opposition. But due
to some poor scheduling, the Tars
now find themselves with an 0-3 rec-
ord. Their opening game was a one
point loss to Stetson, ranked ninth
among small colleges by Basketball
News. Then came another close loss
to Randolph-Macon on the road.

The Generals’ manhandling of the
lars was hardly the same. The Blue
jumped off to an early lead which
they mever surrendered, although
Rollins did manage to tie the score
twice, the last time being at 18-18
The differences in styles of play were
obvious, too, The close teamwork of
the Generals was in sharp contrast
with the highly individual and erratic
play of the Stetson aggregate, and
kept the Blue well out in front
despite a cold-shooting first half

The Generals broke things up for
good right after Rollins had tied
things up at 18-all. Mike Daniel
whipped off four quick points which
were followed by two by Mel Cart-
wright. Trailing by six, Coach Boyd
Coffie ordered a time out and began
forces. When the
lars returned to the court the well-
coordinated Blue were faced with a
full court From that point,
matters went from bad to worse for
Rollins as the Blue continually
caught the opposing forwards out of
position. The W&L guards did have
some trouble getting the ball to
midcourt within fifteen seconds, but

to rearrange his

press,

always managed to get it across

More often than not they found fot
ward Daniel or Mike Neer down
court for an easy two points. By
halftime the Generals had run their
margin up to 40-28,

he second half brought more of
the same as Neer, Cartwright and
Daniel along with varying combina-
tions of guards continued to increase
the W&L lead. Norwood Morrison,
Ellie Gutshall and Bill Rhyne traded
off at guard with fine work both de-
fensively and offensively.

With minutes to go, and
the Blue enjoying a 24 point lead,
Coach Canfield began sending in
substitutes. For a two minute pe!
iod, the Floridians began closing the
gap as the substituted players seem-
ed to have some difficulty getting
together. With five minutes left, the
regulars were sent back in to stem
the tide, because by now the W&L
lead had been reduced to 17.

Ihe American Red Cross is ex-

from the W&L campus tomorrow
from 10 am.-4 p.m. in the TV
lounges of the Student Center. Al-
most 200 pledges and parental per-

one for a pint of blood have been
promised from W&L students.

The fraternity with the largest
number of donors will receive a
keg of beer with which to recon-
stitute their blood.

Because of the usual shortage of
blood supply during the Christmas
season, it is important that everyone
possible yields a pint.

He was taken down to the trainer's

Thornton picks
Penn State as
number 1 team

(Continued from Page 3)

State play on television, I can risk
some kind of comparative judgment.
Ihe Longhorns have their share of
stars, concentrated in the offensive
backfield and along the offensive
front wall. For instance, Texas quar-
terback James Street proved him-
self as the Southwest Conference
player of the year with his clutch
play against Arkansas, and backs
Wooster, Key, and Berielson have
been great all year in rolling up fan-
tastic rushing and scoring statistics.

On the other hand, the forces of
Penn State coach Joe Paterno also
offer individual stars. The Nittany
Lions offense is frightening with
such backs as Charley Pittman,
Franco Harris, and Lydell Mitchell.
This trio shows three game break-
ers, as opposed to the Longhorn’s
methodical maulers. And the Penn
State defense is equally awesome.
Led by All-American picks Mike
Reid and Dennis Onkotz and sup-
ported by such beasts as aptly named
Steve Smear, the Pennsylvanians are
grudging defenders.

What would be the result of such
a dream game? How would Reid
Fare against Texas All-American
Bobby McKay, or Ankotz againsi
Wooster? We won't know this year,
so the post-bowl comparisions will
have to decide whether or not
President Nixon in fact picked a
winner.

Keep your eye on the last wire
service poll-my bet is that Governor
Shafer and his fellow Pennsylvanians
will have an even stronger claim on
that number one spot following the
New Year's Day fireworks.

Hickman explains fish physiology:
kidney function revealed in book

A Washington and Lee University
biology professor has written a fish
story.

In this case, however, it’s not a
story of the one that got away. In-
stead, Dr. Cleveland P. Hickman,
Jr. of Washington and Lee and Dr.
Benjamin F. Trump of Duke Uni-
versity have jointly made the first
attempt to assemble all available
information concerning structure and
function of the fish kidney.

Medical physiologists have long
been interested in the fish kidney,
which is remarkably advanced, Dr.
Hickman noted, Certain kinds of

Only the new more luxurious full

research are more readily accom-
plished with fish than with mam-
mals, including man, Fish kidneys
have frequently been used as model
systems for studying abnormal kid-
ney function following injury or
disease.

The work of Drs. Hickman and
Trump appears as the second chap-
ter of a multi-author, multi-volume
treatise entitled Fish Physiology,
which is being published by Acade-
mic Press of New York.

Included in the chapter are 22
line drawings, 35 light photo-micro-
graphs, and 25 electron photomicro-
graphs and many of the line draw-
ings are original. The 148-page chap-
ter follows the subject from the
primitive hagfishes and lampreys to
the advanced fresh-water and mar-
ine fishes. From their studies, the
authors were able to reconstruct the
probable evolutionary development
of the vertebrate kidney.

The appearance of the research
is especially timely because of the
increased interest by biologists in
the fish kidney’s sensitivity to the
various industrial pollutants which
are being added to the nation’s
streams and lakes.

Pathology at the Duke University
Medical Center.
