Alumni Conference
Studies University

Yesterday afternoon a_ three-day
conference of alumni representatives
from across the country began.

Following a luncheon at | p.m.,
the delegates met in Lee Chapel at
2:30 p.m. to hear reports from Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley; James
W. Whitehead, University Treasur-
er; and Farris P. Hotchkiss, director
of development. All three spoke on
“The University Today and Its Out-
look for the Future.”

President Huntley delivered the
main report, outlining the recent a-
chievements and needs of the uni-
versity. His purpose, he said, was to
“improve depth of alumni communi-
cations” and to “face changes and
restlessness of a new age.”

Huntley reported that nearly $6
million has been spent for new faci-
lities in the last fifteen years, These
developments include the new alum-
ni house, the new science building,
duPont Hall, renovation of the Co-
op, the bookstore, new upperclass-
men dorms, Evans Dining Hall, and
the Student Union.

He also remarked that the Wash-
ington and Lee faculty is among the
best paid in the country. Also, fi-
nancial aid has increased consider-
ably. Almost 25% of the W&L stu-
dent body receive financial aid in
some way. There has also been an
increase in faculty size, number of
courses offered, and equipment and
research facilities.

Concerning physical needs of the
university, Huntley remarked that
“at this point, funds are not at
hand.” He outlined some of the
planned improvements,

In the near future the University
will build on to the rear of Doremus
Gymnasium, tripling it in size. A
fieldhouse to accommodate indoor
practice of some sports is also being
contemplated. Bids for the gymnas-
ium have already been sought.

Huntley also reported that Me-
Cormack Library and the School of
Commerce building are both inade-
quate. A possible solution, he said,
would be to move the School of
Commerce into the library, and
build a new library. A possible site
for the new structure would be the
edge of the ravine that lies northeast
of the campus, through which the
creek flows.

Other needs include a new School
of Law building, additional upper-
class dorms, and an auditorium, al-
though the auditorium does not have
top priority.

The new buildings will probably
be located, in the area on the edge
of the pine and beyond ii, ex-

panding the campus greatly in that
direction. At this point, though, no
plans are definite.

Parking space would be provided
for students eventually, though not
directly within the campus area.

Yesterday's session was devoted
mainly to finances and attracting
new funds, although all other issues
will be discussed today and tomor-
row. After the session, the alumni
attended a reception at President
Huntley’s home and then a dinner
at Evans Dining Hall.

This morning there was a tour of
the University. Following lunch, the
alumni met in an open forum with
students, at which no faculty or ad-
ministration members were present,

A discussion of the academic side
of W&L was held in Lee Chapel at
3:15 p.m. today. Tonight there will
be a reception and dinner at the Tri-
Brook Country Club,

There will be a discussion to-
morrow at 9 a.m. on student affairs
and athletics; at 10:45 a.m., a pro-
gram on the faculty; and at 11:45
a.m, President Huntley will review
the entire conference. All sessions
will be in Lee Chapel.

The conference ends at noon to-
morrow, after which alumni and
wives will be provided transporta-
tion to the W&L football game at
Bridgewater College.

Gifts to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity totaled $1,986,685 during the
1968-69 fiscal year, the university's
Office of Development reported to-
day.

Gifts increased over the previous
year in all categories, including the
Alumni Fund, Parents Fund, founda-

the total amount for the 1967-68

fiscal year, Hotchkiss said,

“Last year was a very good year
for Washington and Lee in_ this
area,” Hotchkiss said. “Because of
the interest of many people, we
have realized a significant increase
over previous years in gift support.

“However, with the challenges to
privately-supported higher education
and the costs of education ever in-
creasing, this performance will have
to be improved upon in future years.

“Gift income has been increasing
steadily at Washington and Lee, al-
though as a percentage of the Uni-
versity’s overall costs of operation,
it is still not taking a greatly en-
larged part in University financing,”
he said.

Hotchkiss noted that gifts have
moved from approximately 12.5 per-
cent of Washington and Lee's operat-
ing income in 1960-61 to about 15
percent during the past year. How-
ever, the total operating income has
more than doubled in that time—
from $2.2 million to $5.1 million.

Who's

The names of 26 seniors at Wash
ington and Lee will be among those
listed in this year's edition of “Who's
Who Among Students in American
Universities and Colleges,” it was
announced this week,

Each year the publication lists the
outstanding students on the nation’s
campuses, chosen with regard to
achievement, community
service, leadership in extracurricular
and future potential. In
cluded in this list are undergradu
ate seniors as well as those in the

Lexington theater will be 8:30 p.m.
each day.

Troubadour Theatre Director Lee
Kahn, assistant professor of fine
arts, said he chose the play because
he considers Pinter to be an import-
ant contemporary playwright who
will become even more important.

The play, which premiered in
London three years ago, concerns a
man, his brother, and his two sons
living together in a womanless
world, Into their world comes a
third son, who is returning home
after an absence of six years, and
his wife, whom the family has never
met,

The conflict in the play, accord-
ing to Kahn, is within the characters,
not among the characters.

Approximately 50 students have
been involved in preparing the play

the Student Affairs Committee, who
will investigate it and give their re-
port at the next faculty meeting.

According to Harvey Wise, presi-
dent of the Independent Union, the
petition was circulated by eight
freshmen members of the IU and
bears approximately 175 names.

Prater Captures

Debater Alan Prater defeated
fom Mays in yesterday’s freshman
elections, thus winning the right to
represent his class on the Executive
Committee. The position of class
President was won by Rick Gray,
who came from second place in the
primaries to beat Eddie Haslam.
Jeff Burriss, captured the freshman
vice presidency over Long Island-
er Jeff Baugher.

The elections, concluding a week
of campaigning for the six candi-
dates, were marked by a low fresh-
man voting turnout, Less than 60%
of the class cast votes yesterday, a
decrease from Monday’s primaries.

Wednesday night, prior to the
election, all six hopefuls presented
their platforms to the student body.
Almost fifty people attended the
speeches given in the Evans Dining
Hall.

Jeff Baugher was the first speaker
of the evening, and explained to
those present his reasons for runn-
ing. He stated that he thought the
vice president should act as a sort
of middleman, between the class and
the administration. Vice President-
elect Jeff Burriss, whose campaign
slogan was “The Sensible One,”
would like to see the use of class
dues better explained. He also pre-
sented the idea of introducing sev-
eral pass-fail courses to the Fresh-
man curriculum.

Rick Gray admitted that the
“powers of the President are limit-
ed,” but that he would attempt to
increase the numbers of vending ma-
chines in the dorm. One interesting
proposal he made was that of the
possibility of putting washers and
dryers in the dorm.

Attacking the right of the Univer-
sity to interfere with the “dignity of
the individual,” Eddie Haslam ques-
tioned the school’s position of act-
ing in loco parentis,

Both E.C. candidates avoided
issues; instead they were more con-

Presented

Wise promised to give the petition
“the complete and total support of
the Independent Union.”

Dean John said the SAC, “is
presently examining campus park-
ing facilities to see how many more
cars WA&L’s parking lots can ac-
commodate.”

This study could possibly take
several months, he said, speculating
that “it is extremely unlikely that
freshmen will be permitted to keep
cars in Lexington this year.”

He added that “parking will be
the big problem should the admini-
stration allow freshmen to drive.”

Tom Mays said that an E.C, repre-
sentative “should not wait for con-
ditions to warrant grievances, It is
his responsibility to search for and
bring out potential issues.” He pro-
posed an open forum every other
Wednesday at which the class could
present its views.

Alan Prater felt there “is a differ-
ence between being representative of
one’s class, and being a representa-
tive of the class.” If elected he pro-
mised to put his own views aside
for those of the majority.

A Right Way...

The past few weeks here we have witnessed several efforts
on the part of students to assume the responsibility that is al-
ready theirs and to achieve results with it.

Notable success has followed the attempts of the Student
Curriculum Committee and the Independent Union to gain a
faculty hearing for their respective proposals.

The Curriculum Committee has submitted to its faculty
counterpart a resolution requesting extension of the present
pass/fail option. Not only would sophomores be eligible to
take a pass/fail course under this proposal, but juniors and
seniors would be allowed to take pass/fail more than the one
elective to which they are limited under the present rules.

The move is a signifigant one and presents an idea we
have long favored.

Similarly the Independent Union has petitioned the ap-
propriate faculty groups to allow freshmen cars. Clearly the
desire is to offer a better social life, especially to Independent
freshmen, thus presenting the fraternity system with another
challenge.

There are some objections to be made against such a plan,
but it does merit the deliberation the Independent Union has
assured it will get.

We don’t wish at the present time to debate the advan-
tages and shortcomings of these proposals. What we rather
want to point out is the method, both appropriate and ration-
al, with which these proups have presented their arguments
and made their requests.

In both cases the presentations are thorough, unambigu-
ous, and directed to the appropriate faculty groups in a way
which has assured for them maximum consideration and a
final decision based on the merits of the case alone.

These are two examples of the ideal operation of the
University—dialogue between student and faculty engen-
dering the spirit of respect and cooperation without which no
educational institution can maintain itself.

... And A Wrong Way

Unfortunately, not all student groups seem to adhere to
the ideal of cooperation and rational dialogue.

The Interfraternity Council Monday night passed a reso-
lution questioning the authority of the faculty, and particu-
larly of the Student Affairs Committee, to regulate the so-
cial atmosphere of fraternity houses.

The point is a sound one. Every generation of students
should be able to re-evaluate its relationship with the par-
ental authority the University imposes and to reach with
the faculty an amicable arrangement which is more attuned to
the moral realities of the age. Further, the IFC put forth
some convincing arguments for their case.

There are likewise some objections to be made. For in-
stance, the analogy between fraternity houses and apartments
is some what unsubstantial, and the resolution fails to take
into account the extent to which the University is financially
involved in fraternities.

But despite some problems, the resolution deserves the
serious attention its method of presentation nearly preclud-
ed for it.

What essentially happened was that the Judicial Board
prior to the regular Monday meeting sought and got for the
proposal the approval of all the house presidents. It was
then to be presented in the meeting, to which the predomi-
nantly faculty Student Affairs Committee had been invited.
They were handed the proposal only moments before it was
brought to a vote and asked to comment. Of course, they
could say nothing.

After the vote, itself an apparent (though perhaps not
intended) act of arrogance and irresponsibility, a verbal ex-
change on the subject, notable only for its virulence and un-
productiveness, occurred.

Had not informal discussion groups later convinced SAC
members of the sincerity and spirit of cooperation most of
the IFC members possess, the evening would have been a
total waste and the resolution would have been rejected with-
out consideration. As it is, there remains at least the chance
that something beneficial will result.

We are not accusing the IFC hierarchy of consciously
devising a presentation intended only to embarrass some of
its closest faculty friends and to confuse the issues. It is certain-
ly the case that that was almost the end result, and the Ju-
dicial Board ought to have foreseen the problem and taken
steps to prevent it.

Neither are we suggesting that the current student-fac-
ulty relationship tne rights and authority is tenable
for any long period of time. It will, however, require more
time to arrive at a viable solution than the IFC seems will-
ing to allow.

The problem is that the IFC, at last moving in a direc:
tion most students probably approve, took its initial steps in a
way that precludes the spirit of cooperation and respect nec-
essary for it to realize its goal. And unless the IFC retreats
and takes a rational and reasonable approch to the situation
(SAC, by taking no action this week, has afforded them the
time), it is likely very soon to become mired in the image of
irresponsibility it is trying hard to escape.

Motherhood, Apple Pie and Archives

By Lawrence McConnell

When one mentions the word
“archives,” the immediate impres-
sion evoked is one of old dusty do-
cuments discarded in a dark room
somewhere. And, as brought to
much-needed light in Mack Wood-
ward’s article in the October 14
issue of the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi,
WAL’s library contains many ar-
chives—which are dusty documents
discarded in dark rooms upstairs.

Washington and Lee has accumu-
lated a tremendous amount of ar-
chives as a result of alumni con-
tribution of letters, books, and do-
cuments over the past 100 years of
the school’s history. Lamentably, no
cataloguing of these archives was
ever done: and so they (as Wood-
ward aptly put it) “sit and rot.”

So. The problem now becomes
should we or should we not do any-
thing about cataloguing these arti-
facts? No one is actively against
archives—just as no one is protest-
ing against motherhood or apple
pie. But who is for finding some
way of caring for old archives?

Mr. Maurice Leach, the school’s
Librarian, is. And so are several
alumni that have sent inquiries to
Mr. Leach about the facilities for
storing records and valuable books
here. Unfortunately, these alumni
have sent their historical documents
somewhere else because our facili-
ties would not be suitable for the
storage of their documents, One case
in point is that of a man who want-
ed to send Washington and Lee his
collection of war letters of the Con-
federacy, but decided to send them
elsewhere when he learned about
storage and cataloguing conditions
here.

Not only are the archives in our
present possession wasting away, but

we are also missing the chance to
collect more valuable documents
from alumni and friends of the uni-
versity. It might seem a bit laugh-
able now, but W&L could become
the center for valuable documents
in the history of Virginia.

One letter to Mr. Leach illustrates
what we already have. The author
of the letter is a prominent historian
of religion who happened to browse
through the pile of documents in
McCormick Library. “From = my
examination of the Zachariah John-
ston papers and the George Baxter
papers, | am delighted and impress-
ed with the importance of a num-
ber of these for Virginia Presby-
terian history and for the story of
the achievement of separation of
church and state... | hope, for the
sake of scholars in general, you
will be able to move ahead with the
indexing and publicizing of these
holdings.”

Another letter to Mr. Leach is
from a gentleman who plans to give
a collection of letters and documents
to W&L, but regrets that there is no
archivist to look after them. “Wash-
ington and Lee will receive, how-
ever, my quite considerable library
of local histories—S.C., N.C., Va.,
and Ga. .. . Sorry there is no archi-
vist available there, for this collec-
tion will require an expert to straigh-
ten it out. It covers nearly fifty years
of collecting...”

Perhaps the most enlightening and
significant letter of all those sent to
Mr. Leach is from the head of the
Rare Books and Special Collections
Department at the University of
Virginia. The following is his ob-
servation on the state of the archives
in McCormick: “. . . there is no
doubt in my mind that you should
make every attempt to allocate pro-

 

Letters To The Editor . . |

 

An Answer to Perkinson

To the editor of the Friday
Ring-tum Phi:

After reading Brian Perkinson’s
rather erratic polemic in last Fri-
day's paper, | was determined not to
answer it, but the temptation has
proved overwhelming. Before try-
ing to criticize effectively Mr. Per-
kinson’s argument for social stagna-
tion at WAL, I must say that I have
no hope of persuading him to my
point of view; the emotionalism of
his letter convinces me that he is
beyond that—-which is why I hesitat-
ed to answer it, However, I trust
that the sensible reader will judge
Mr. Perkinson’s argument and my
case against it and the way it was
presented on their relative merits.

The first half of Mr. Perkinson’s
letter was given over to a denuncia-
tion of last Wednesday's Morator-
ium and how it was conducted here.
Perhaps a case is to be made against
last Wednesday's occurences on a
number of points, most of which Mr.
Perkinson barely touched in his rush
to judgment. He mentioned teachers
depriving students of class hours
“they paid for” and then hurried on
to something else. | don't think Mr,
Perkinson stopped long enough to
consider his point, which involves
a question of educational philoso-
phy.

Perhaps Mr. Perkinson can ap-
preciate only the time he spends in
class, but I also enjoy a scholarly
atmosphere which lends itself to an
objective discussion of the prob-
lems of individuals in their political
and social structures, Mr. Perkin.
son doesn't even think that our dis-
cussion of Vietnam should have
been scheduled for last Wednesday
1 disagree with him on this, too,
but the important point is that a
certain balance must be struck be.

tween Mr. Perkinson’s way of think-
ing and somebody else's on the other
end of the spectrum. | believe that
this balance was successfully struck
last Wednesday by the faculty and
those involved in the Moratorium.

The preceding and certain other
points are what Mr, Perkinson and
| could probably discuss in a con-
structive manner. What really con-
cerns me, though, are his thoroughly
destructive prevarications about
“Papa lefty nepotism” (whatever that
means), the “screaming minority,”
and a question like, “If we really
want to get “relevant’ why don't we
just talk all day about whatever
comes to mind?” These kinds of as-
persions on a certain group's mo-
tives, on what was actually their ex-
cellent conduct, and, finally, even
on the group's intelligence were com-
pletely unwarranted.

In the end they probably render-
ed the basis of Mr, Perkinson’s argu-
ment laughable in the mind of the
average reader, which needn't have
been the case. An imperfect analogy
can be drawn between Mr. Perkin-
son's tactics and the Nixon Admini-
stration’s imputations of disloyalty
last week which were an insult to
men of such long service to their
country as Arthur Goldberg and
Averell Harriman—who endorsed
the Moratorium.

Regrettably, Mr. Perkinson didn't
rest his case against progress at a
certain point, but went on to mourn
this university's policy of trying to
induce the enrollment of qualified
black students. In so doing, Mr, Per-
kinson was, | trust, defining himself
us a conservative idealist. A useful
example of this type is the Supreme
Court of the early 1930's, which
ruled much of FDR's greatly needed
social legislation unconstitutional be-
cause it perceived the constitution as

per space in McCormick for special
materials and to provide money in
the budget for staff to arrange, cata-
logue and care for them. Washington
and Lee has been fortunate over the
years in receiving books and manu-
scripts that are important to scho-
larship and it has an obligation to
preserve these materials for future
scholarship.” (Boldface mine).

Washington and Lee does have
“an obligation” to begin the task of
compiling what is presently in rot-
ting disarray. To accomplish the pre-
servation of these archives, several
actions must be taken.

(1) A fulltime archivist must be
hired, one who knows the value and
methods of  systematizing the
mounds of materials we have at pre-
sent,

(2) Some part-time help must be
given this archivist from the library
staff in order to aid him physically
with the job.

(3) Provision must be made for
the temperature control of two re-
served rooms in the library to pro-
tect these documents from extremes
of temperature which tend to cause
deterioration.

Any change for the better at Wash-
ingion and Lee seems to be preced-
ed immediately by the expenditure
of money. And if we are to have
any change for the better in the case
of our archives, it will, without
doubt, cost money, But the preserva-
tion of W&L’s archives would be
more than just a change for the
better; it would be a discovery of
what we have (no one seems to be
quite sure what’s there), a restora-
tion of the valuable documents that
W&L men of the past wanted the
university to have, and a boost in
prestige for our archives,

“No one is against archives.” At
present, that’s the only sort of posi-
live statement one can make.

“Last Summer’s” Moment

By Robert Baroody
Editor-in Chief of Ariel

There is a scene in Last Summer
that makes this movie a good one; in
fact, this three minute segment may
be the most eloquent statement of a
troubled generation yet to be found
in recent film history. The setting,
appropriately enough, is a movie
theatre on Long Island.

Three adolescents are watching
what we assume to be an adult
movie: two boys, obviously on the
make, flank on either side of a
sensuous sophisticate of sixteen
named Sandy. Both of the boys be-
gin to nibble simultaneously; fin-
gers mesh and wiggle together, look-
ing very much like one fifth of a cen-
tipede in heat. The hands of the boys
then stray to those parts of the
female body that hands usually stray
to. The rhythm of their fingers is
at first searching, but as the boys
realize their mutual bond of sensual-
ity, they lean in on Sandy from eith-
er side and soon her shirt grotesque-
ly bulges with ten lumpy knuckles.

(Next week, my first installment
of Naked Came the Stranger, Part
Ml will appear in this very same
space!)

This simile of “groping in the
dark” reappears throughout the
movie as the group attempts to at-
tach their destiny to an existing set
of ideals, much as we at WAL must
continually persuade ourselves that
this hassle called education has some
value.

In fact, what makes Last Summer
work is based on that familiar pro-
cess of identification that we applied
to Goodbye, Columbus and The
Graduate. The characters in Last
Summer are very nearly siereotypes:
Sandy, the girl whose bikini straps

are forever slipping off of her shoul-
ders, whose mother’s lover is simply
the Long Island version of Benjamin
Braddock’s father; Rhoda, whose
prototype was Piggy in The Lord of
the Flies; and if we look across the
street we notice that Lexington
abounds with Peters and Dans
spawned from the same overindul-
gent environment. We need only
substitute Chevy Chase for Short
Hills.

From the very first frame this
sense of identity is firmly established
by the blast of WABC radio, one of
the very few symbols that is common
to young people in the Northeast.
Similar symbols and actions are
used to reinforce our sense of gen-
eration so that we think we know
the characters in the film as well as
ourselves. (Even the experience of
the first joint has now become a
movie cliche.) These children are
not human beings, but rather dis-
tortions of the same; and in this
form are capable of shocking our
conditioned sensibility. The most
alarming piece of dialogue occurs
early in the film as Dan says to
Peter, “Hey, do you think we ought
to lay her?”, to which Peter replies
“Who?” brilliantly punctuating the
bizarre, if not absurd use of the
first person plural,

Almost all the rest of the dialo-
gue is overly glib: predictable words
are spoken by predictable types, a
common fault of every movie pro-
duced by people over 40 years old
for the under-25 group. Last Sum-
mer atones for this weakness how-
ever, by exposing us to leisurely per-
iods of silence, the most moving of
which concludes the film by stimu-
lating our memory process. What
did you do three, four or five years
ago?

first half as both teams could not
generate much offense. Much of the
play was at mid-field with the half
backs dominating the play. V.M.L
had a golden opportunity, though
in the second quarter when one of
the Generals fullbacks failed in trap-
ing the ball and V.M.L.’s left in-
side had a one-on-one break away
to the goal. Goalie Ken Newman
moved out to cut off the angle, and
the move worked as the shot veered
to the right of the net.

The third quarter saw a revitalized
W&L team take the field, though. It
took V.M.I, only 4:13 to succumb
to the pressure of the quick W&lI
attack as Chip Tompkins took an-
other Kampfmueller cross pass and
drilled in the Generals second goal

Carl Hyatt, the best offensive half-
back on the team, moved up from
his position to take a pass from the
left side at 16:34 of the third quar-
ter Hyatt threaded his way
through the = struggling V.M.1.
defenders and beat the goalie
to give W&L a secure 3-0 lead.

Coach Lyles started substituting
freely at this point. The fourth quar
ier saw a lot of close checking as the
offenses of both teams stalled. Chip
lompkins let go a high loop shot
from thirty yards out at 20:03 of
the final quarter, and the ball sail
ed over the outstretched arms of the
V.M.1. goalie, thus ending the WAI
scoring in a frustrating game for
the Keydets

“It wasn't one of our better games,
but Til take it,” Coach Joe Lyles
said after he had seen his young
team up its record to 5S-I-1. “I
thought it was going to be hard to
get up for this game after three ex
tremely tough ones in a row, but
that early Belt goal took the pres-
sure off. V.M.1. was 0-4-1 coming

The only thing that spoiled last
week’s Football Centennial Celebra-
tion at Washington and Lee was the
fact that Tufts beat the Generals in
a stormy match 20-15,

Nearly forty former gridders re-
turned to Lexington to relive past
glories. Among the group were
George Haw of Richmond and Daw-
son Trundle of Bethesda, Maryland,
the last surviving members of the
1902 team. Also honored were W. E.
(Tex) Tilson, head coach of the
1934 Southern Conference cham-
pions and seven of his charges,
George Harrison, Charles Sweet,
Joe (Double-O) Arnold, Lewis Mar-
tin, Ed Seitiz, George Lowry, and
Sam (Monk) Madison were on hand
to recount that 7-3 season.

Dave Waters, Joe McCutcheon,
Charles Smith, Jack Garst, Ray
Leister, Roland Thompson, Jim

Stark, Bob Goldsmith, Gil Bocetti,
and Mike Radulovic represented the
1950 Southern Conference champs
who participated in the Gator Bowl.

Eighteen members of the 1961
team which was voted the nation’s
Outstanding Small College, eleven
by the Washington Touchdown Club
were honored: Robin Wood, Mickey
Walker, John Lee, Tommy Good-
win, Sam Preston, John McDaniel,
Henry Sackett, Bobby Payne, Joe
Howson, Charley Gummer, Bill
Wheeler, Barton Dick, Courtney
Mauzy, Steve Suttle, George Cruger,
Jerry Hyatt, Chip Day, and Ned
Hobbs.

Each former player received a
Centennial certificate and medal at
Saturday's halftime activities. In ad-
dition, the ex-gridders were guests at
the 1969 squad’s pre-game meal and
were also honored at a post-game

Phi Delts Capture Tennis Title

With the arrival of cooler weather,
the fall Intramural season is luckily
drawing to a close. The Phi Delts
have already captured the tennis
championship. Sigma Nu, last year’s
champion lost to the Phi Delts, 3-2,
and thus failed to defend success-
fully. Z.B.T., the second place finish-
er a year ago, fell all the way to
fourth place. Phi Psi took third
place. The final standing and points
for I-M tennis are as follows:

1) PDT (League B) 3-0 100 pts
2) SN (League A) 2-1 95 pts
3) PKP (League D) 1-2 90 pts
4) ZBT (League C) 0-3 85 pts

The championship playoffs in

touch football begin next week. The
Phi Delts and Phi Kaps and the
team representing the Law School
each won their leagues. Three teams
ended the regular season tied for
the championship in the remaining
league. In the playoffs to determine
the league champion, SAE beat
DTD on Wednesday and then lost to
Phi Psi on Thursday. Thus Phi Psi
is the winner.

The finals in golf are now being
The two three-way ties that
existed have been resolved with Phi

University Center
To Offer Lectures

The first of nine scholars schedul-
ed to lecture at Washington and Lee
University under the Visiting Scho-
lars program of the University Cen-
ter in Virginia will appear next
week,

Dr. Richard B. Sewall, professor
of English at Yale University, is to
lecture Tuesday on the topic “Dialo-
gue in Literature.”

He will be followed on Thursday
by Dr. Laurence Wylie, who holds
the C. Douglas Dillon Professorship
of the Civilization of France at Har-
vard University.

Both lectures will be open to the
public without charge. They will be
held in the duPont Hall auditorium,

Sewall, whose appearance is spon-
sored by the English department and
the Seminar in Literature program,
will speak at 8:15 p.m.

A book by Sewall, The Lyman
Letters: New Light on Emily Dick-
enson and Her Family, was publish-
ed in 1966. He is currently working
on a biography of Emily Dickenson.

Wylie’s lecture, which is on the
topic of “Psychological Aspects of
Franco-American Relations,” will

an almost “divine” law, rather than
as a Viable social contract, the ideals
of which are inviolable.

Such a limited perspective as Mr.
Perkinson’s, coming in this singular-
ly deciesive chapter of the national
experience, is extremely unfortun-
ate, Large portions of our popula-
tion, not only but especially black
people, are socially and economi-
cally deprived, and the hands of our
most prestigeous institutions, among
them universities, must not be tied
in dealing with such vitally import-
ant problems.
