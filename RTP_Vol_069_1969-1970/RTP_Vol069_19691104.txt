W&L concerts
expand as music
series flourish

Pianist Savory tonight

NEW ADDITIONS TO
CONCERT LINE-UP

The Rockbridge Concert-Theatre
Series announced that it has con-
tracted two new attractions to re-
place the cancelled concert by the
Washington National Symphony,
which was to have opened the local
season last week. Series president
Col. F. H. Barksdale stated that the
Board of Managers was pleased with
the replacement of the long-time an-
chor event with two such outstand-
ing attractions.

Col. Barksdale reported that the
problem was resolved through a
search for artists with open dates
convenient to the fall calendar of
the community. The limited funds
available to the Series made the
search a difficult task, Barksdale
added that the Series Board had
hoped to replace the National Sym-
phony with another symphony or-
chestra, but approaches to five other
orchestras were unsuccessful.

The revised 1969-1970 Series will
offer four instead of the originally
scheduled three events. These include
the Roger Wagner Chorale, which
performed last night; the Paul Win-
ter Contemporary Concert on Feb.
16; the Cologne Chamber Orchestra
on March 2; and Marcia Baldwin,
mezzo-soprano of the Metropolitan
Opera Co., on April 21. Her recital
here will be the concluding event of
the Series.

The Chorale came to Lexington
as a part of its tour of the eastern
states. It appeared at VMI's Jackson
Memorial where its thirty voices
came into harmony. Wagner's varied
program included selections from all
the great periods of choral music.

As for tonight, the Concert Guild
will sponsor the second program of
its 1969-1970 series, John Savory, 4
renowned pianist, will preform in
Lee Chapel at eight. In addition to
a program of contemporary music,
Savory plans to deliver an informa-
tive commentary.

He has chosen several composi-
tions as illustrations. These include
Sonata, op. 1, by Alban Berg; Three
Studies by Peter Racine Fricker:
and Variations, op. 27, by Fredrick
Goosen. Along with these, Savory
will play a selection from “Three
Winter Potatoes”, by Cornelius Car-
dew.

Mr. Savory is a native of London
and at an early age became inter-
ested in the piano. He finished his
studies after three years under Pro
fessor Herbert Fryr, and soon took
up lecturing at Oxford University
4 few years later, Savory decided to
devote himself completely to the
piano, and moved to Vienna to study

Night-time service in
Co-op back in action

By Steve Ory

Last night's Executive Committee
meeting was highlighted by the an-
nouncement of the opening of the
Co-op for evening service. The store
opened last night and will be open
from 8:00 pm until 10:30 pm Sun-
day through Thursday. Student pat-
ronage is encouraged in order to
keep this service functionable.

The main business of the meeting
was devoted to a discussion of stu-
dent affairs as mentioned in the
various constitutions and charters of
campus organizations. Specific at-
tention was focused on the student
affairs rules present in faculty legis-
lating bodies. It was pointed out that
the faculty committees’ by-laws
have not been revised since 1958,
The current body of rules was de-
scribed as “chaotic and in need of
revision.” A committee consisting of
Dave Bethea, Glenn Azuma, Bill
Andrews, and Swede Henberg was
appointed to investigate: 1) the fac-
ulty rules that apply to students and
2) the student opinion concerning
these rules.

Freshman Bill Millkey reported
that the movies shown last weekend
were favorably received. Approxi-
mately 200 students attended and
plans are being made to show movies
every other weekend. Millkey com-
plained of the problem in finding a

Plans were made to work out this
difficulty through Dean John’s office.
Rick Gray, Freshman Class Presi-
dent, reported that the only serious
objection of the faculty to freshmen
having cars was the parking prob-
lem. He proposed that the EC spon-
sor a resolution to allow freshmen
to keep motorcycles. His proposal
met strong objection from Commit-

teemen Dean Kumpuris, Phil
Thompson, Chuck Dobbins, and
Staman Ogilvie. Freshman repre

sentative Alan Prater brought the
proposal up for a vote and it was
defeated by a vote of two to eight.
John Markham, Freshman Law rep-
resentative, and Prater voted in
favor of the resolution.

Phil Thompson reported that he
was still investigating the law stu-
dents’ housing situation and he pre-
ferred to wait before taking any ac-
tion on this.

Interviews for freshmen positions
on the standing committees were
made after the EC meeting. Smitty
Smith and Tom Mays were appoint
ed to the University Center Com
mittee. George Wolfe and Jay Wil-
kins were appointed to the Curri-
culum Committee and Chris Gira-
gosian and Brad Hall were appointed
to the Cold Check Committee. The
Library Committee received the sin
gle addition of James Zeppieri.

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

 

Rush each semester

Tuesday, November 4, 1969

 

Mature gentlemen?

Conscientious students here and across the nation are cur-
rently laboring in a great desire to prove that the majority of
us are mature and responsible people capable of intelligent
thought and action. Nationwide, the reason for this effort is to
gain the respect of policy makers in general so that student
sentiments, which we ourselves see as legitimately founded,
will be heard with open minds. Limiting this purpose to the
academic society of Washington and Lee, student leaders—
most noticeably at this time, those in the Interfraternity Coun-
cil—are trying to convince the faculty that we are able to
govern ourselves, precluding the necessity of their dictating to
us “in loco parentis.””

Sad but true, both in our own microcosm and in the na-
tion as a whole, a few ill-considered actions by a careless arro-
gant minority guarantee that the responsible behavior of the
majority will be discounted.

Last Friday, several young colored residents of Lexington
were innocently trick-or-treating at one of our fraternity
houses. A few members of that house haughtily objected, yell-
ing obscene and embarrassing racial taunts from their front
porch. Fortunately, the children, displaying considerably
more intelligence than our fellow W&L gentlemen, quietly
left.

Shortly thereafter, someone from another fraternity
hurled a soft drink bottle through a window in that same
house. This ridiculous act apparently led the brothers in the
first house to believe that they had the license to punish any-
one who happened to drive or walk past their building. In
short order they began tossing ice balls indiscriminately at
passing automobiles and pedestrians. Later, their little game
developed to the point of throwing a soft drink bottle from
the third story balcony at two students walking in the street
below.

We feel that it is our duty: first, to condemn the irrespon-
sible and childish behavior of those few members of that fra-
ternity; second, to offer the defensive argument that such mis-
behavior on our part is very rare; third, to plead with the
faculty that such misdeeds on the part of a few students should
not be held accountable to the many; and finally, to apologize
to the people of Lexington on behalf of the responsible maj-
ority of Washington and Lee students.

Down with grass

Our campus, if divided into linear measures, does not ex-
tend over a comparatively large area. However, it is ques-
tionable that ample space is not available for development
into parking facilities. This excuse for delaying action on the
matter of permitting freshmen to own cars is surely devoid of
substance.

For example, the grass plot situated between the old dorm
and Doremus Gymnasium could be hard-surfaced without a
great degree of difficulty. Granted that plot in itself may not
be large enough, but it would be an excellent place to start.

We hope that such a relatively simple matter as parking
space does not long obscure the vision of the faculty to the
merits of the petition for freshmen cars. Freshmen, if they are
allowed to own and operate automobiles, would have an ade-
quate alternative to fraternity membership for the first time.
This is an alternative which the University by right should
have provided long ago to its students.

About our EC reporting

Mr. Henberg has publicly accused The Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi of “egregious misrepresentation” in its reporting of
last week's Executive Committee meeting.

Our story read: “Swede Henberg announced a University
building fund drive which is to begin within eighteen
months.”

The official minutes for that meeting, recorded by senior
committeeman Dave Bethea and signed by Student Body
Secretary Chuck Dobbins, read: “Henberg also announced
that within eighteen months the University will launch a
major fund drive, and that students were needed to work on
the ground floor.”

In his letter in the Friday Edition Mr. Henberg wrote: “I
write to clarify what I feel is an egregious misrepresentation of
last Monday's Executive Committee meeting . . . My inten-
tion was certainly not to ‘announce’ anything, and I feel sure
I was tentative enough in my approach to the matter that no
one should have assumed I was making a formal announce-
ment.”

We hope that in the future Mr. Henberg, as President of
the Student Body, will clarify his statements at the time that
he makes them, and not wait to do so until four days later in
the Friday paper. We also hope that he does not again attack
this newspaper for misinterpreting his intentions—for we re-
ported the statements we heard—when evidently he fails to
communicate those intentions to members of the very com-
mittee he leads!

If we, misled by Mr. Henberg’s lack of clarity, caused our
readers to believe that plans have been prepared for a build.
ing fund drive, we are sorry for propagating this misinforma-
tion.

By Reeve Kelsey
IFC Senior Justice

We feel the present system of
rush should remain basically intact.
A deferred rush will bring more un-
desirable results that will outweigh
the gains by converting to a deferred
rush system.

The major problem lies in the
area of contact. Assuming a no con-
tact system, there will be a division
between the freshmen and upper-
classmen which is undesirable at a
small university such as W&L and
where fraternity men form a large
majority of the upperclass student
body. Enforcement of no contact
would be almost impossible.

Assuming a limited or no contact
situation which is the more feasible
of the two alternatives could easily
result in a rush that lasts 6 weeks or
one semester rather than one which
last but one week. Rush week is a
very intense period and the selection
of a freshman class is one of the
most crucial decisions in the continu-
ity. There is no efficient, equitable,
and inexpensive way that the fresh-
men may be divided up among fra-
ternities on the major party week-
ends. An effective system of smokers
in the fall or winter will become a
time-wasting effort for all involved.
Many freshmen will seek to impress
a fraternity and every fraternity’s ac-
tions will be rush conscious. What is
a freshman going to say when asked
by a fraternity to go down the road?
The freshman class is small enough
so that each fraternity does not face
an impersonal group, but a series of
individuals—each of whom will be
sought out and evaluated. It is our
belief that a deferred rush with com-
plete or limited contact will soon be-
come a semester long rush.

li will be a rare freshman, where
fraternity affiliation will be a major
determinant of future status on
campus, who will involve himself in
only academics during the week and
fraternities over the weekend. If all
freshmen were like this “rational”
freshman, the deferred rush system
would work, but like the “rational”
voter in politics, the “rational”
freshmen are far and few between.

There are advantages not only to
the fraternity system, but to the
University in the present system.
Rush is over when classes begin. The
freshman is oriented more quickly
into the University community with
contact with upperclass fraternity
members. This wide range of early
friendships will definitely help in as-
similating him. Some fraternities
have scholarship programs to aid
those that are in scholastic trouble.
Pre-school rush has this distinct ad-
vantage of moving the freshman
quickly into the entire scope of the
University.

The present system of rush is said
to be blind. How can the freshman
make the right choice in a week?
Most freshmen could probably easily
fit into any one of three or four fra-
ternities. A given fraternity will find
itself rushing primarily against the

Development:
important and

necessary role

By Reed Byrum

Although frequently unnoticed by
many students the Development Of-
fice maintains one of the most im-
portant functions in the University.

Since its inception during the Cole
administration, this department has
blossomed into one of the most
‘profitable’ endeavors of the school.
the Development Office is concern-
ed with raising of all funds for the
University, with the long-range idea
being to meet the rising financial
needs of the school. Prior to its
birth, funds were raised only to
finance specific needs, such as class-
rooms or dorms, bul, as costs rose,
the situation had to be revamped.

the product of this realignment
was the Development Office, and the
significant by-product has been in-
creased funds for the school. The
Alumni drives, the R. E. Lee As
sociaies, and the Parents Fund are
now all channeled through this of-
fice. The mechanics of such cam-
paigns are centered there, as is the
reception of all gifts to the Univer.
sity. All gifts received by the school
are catalogued and recorded here to
keep an accurate account of contri-
butions,

Mr. Farris Hotchkiss is directo:
of this office and is assisted by Wil-
liam Tyler; both are WAL alumni.
Their task is ever increasing in
wope, as both needs and expenses
rise, and represents one of the mos!
necessary functions of the Washing
ton and Lee administration

same four or five fraternities year
after year. Although the freshmen
may be dazed for the first two days,
the choice can be narrowed down
to a few fraternities by the end of
the week. Likewise each fraternity
is evaluating each freshman and it is
very certain that the freshman will
fit into the fraternity before he is
bid.

One of the widely suggested
changes designed to make the sys-
lem more equitable is formalization
of the present deferred rush. It
would require the fraternities to
rush those who desire fraternity af-
filiation, The present system leaves
the deferred rush option to the dis-
cretion of the fraternities.

We feel that when all the pros and
cons are fully evaluated, the basic
system of pre-school rush is the least
harmful to both the fraternities and
the University.

By David Higgins

Our present rushing system is
again under question from those who
claim that it sometimes forces fresh-
men to make a hasty and pressured
decision about fraternity member-
ship. All of the deferred rush plans
proposed so far, however, are either
too great a financial strain on the
houses or they provide little or no
social life for the freshmen compar-
able to that he now receives. In the
following proposed system of “dou-
ble rushing” I feel that the best solu-
tion to the problem can be found.

In a double rush system there
would be two six-day rush weeks,
one at the beginning of each twelve-
week semester of the 12-12-6. The
mechanics of each rush week would
exist as they do now, with altera-
tions made for classes during the sec-
ond twelve-week term and for the
likelihood that the weather would

What's wrong with rush?

By Professor Lewis La Rue

The most incredible thing about
the present rush system is the type
of argument that is used to defend
it. I realize that it does take ingenu-
ity to defend the status quo, but
even so, there is one thing that par-
ticularly astonishes me: the defenses
that are offered are compelling in-
dictments of the present system.

The argument against the status
quo is simple. One points to two ob-
vious facts: the fraternity men and
the freshmen make their choices on
the basis of information about each
other that is gained during several
meetings that occur within one week;
the type of information that each
gets about the other is merely infor-
mation about how the other per-
forms at a social function. In short,
there is not much information, and
what there is, is the wrong kind.

Having established these facts, one
then makes some assumptions about
what is required for rational action
and the rest of the argument falls
easily into place.

What defense is offered? Mr. Kel-
sey was kind enough to show me the
first draft of his above presentation:
he had a section on the problems
that would be caused by change and
then a section on defense of the
system,

In his defense of the present situa-
tion, he stated what he thought were
the advantages of the status quo.
The sentence that struck me was:
“Rush is over when classes begin.”
Is the implication that rush is some-
thing like registration for class or
placement testing? If so, then it is
logical to get it out of the way. But
surely, no one will contend that rush
is not important; at least it might be
said that it is strange for a defender
of the fraternity system to contend
that rush is not important.

Mr. Kelsey apparently does be-
lieve that it is important, because
he goes on to describe how the fra-
lernities are key in “assimilating”
the freshman. However, if the de-
cision is important, then it should
not be hastily made. In short, there
is an irony here that has been over-
looked: if rush is as important as it
seems to be, then it should not come
first; if it is not important, then
there is no real reason to have it.

Another way of defending the
statis quo against change is to argue
that change will bring too many dis-
agreeable problems. This argument
is also made by Mr. Kelsey; the in-
soluble problems of “contact rules”
is posed, and the specter of a semes-
ter-long rush is raised.

In order to believe that this argu-
ment is @ serious one it is necessary
to believe that a fraternity man will
be unable to speak to a non-frater-
nity freshman without the context
of rush being the governing structure
of that conversation, Are we to be-
lieve that students can not be human

beings with each other? There are
numerous organizations on _ this
campus that provide an opportunity
for political or community service,
for musical or theatrical expression,
for journalistic or literary training.
Could not the affiliation decisions be
based upon what one learns in such
a context?

In short, why take such a depress-
ing view of human nature? I refuse
to believe that students are unable
to meet and talk to each other with-
out the support of “contact rules.”

I hope that no one will take these
few paragraphs as an anti-fraternity
tract. Indeed, | have always believ-
ed that for young men to gather to-
gether and call themselves brothers
is potentially (although it may not
work out that way) a noble act. But
there can be no nobility to a board-
ing house which chooses its boarders
by an act of social irrationality,

in this connection, perhaps it is
Wise to raise the question of why the
fraternities are having such a prob-
lem of keeping the loyalty of the up-
perclassmen. Is it merely the parietal
rules, or does the selection process
itself bear some part of the blame?
Might it not be that the rush pro-
cedures are the major obstacle to
the creation of a solid sense of fra-
ternity?

courage, and courtesy, to sing their
written opinions. Apparently this
does not apply to “alumni and fath-
ers,” especially if they hold the radi-
cal and dangerous position of de-
fending the status quo. I hope this
is not the kind of courage “Alumnus
and father” was speaking of.

Captain Courageous said he hoped
we have the courage to be different.
We do: we have the courage not
only to be different from other
schools, but from each other also.
Hopefully we did not come here to
jump into our “business-like” uni-
forms and march off to learn enough
data to succeed in Daddy's business,
but to get an education at a small,
unique, and supposedly individualis-
lic institution. Perhaps in the days of
pre-World War Il, people went to
schools to wear suits and say “hi!”
I did not; | came here for an (whis-
per i) education,

I find it extremely ironic that we
ate asked to uphold the values of a
Southern establishment which the

prevent houses from setting up in the
Quad at that time. The freshmen
would be allowed to register for
either or both of the rush weeks.

There are several advantages to
this system. By allowing the fresh-
inen to go through either rush week,
we would be allowing him to decide
personally which type of rush would
be best for him and his own situa-
tion here on campus.

Some boys would like to immedi-
ately join a fraternity; for these, the
first semester week would be best.
Other boys would rather get the
feel of college life before deciding on
fraternity membership; here, the sec-
ond term rush would be best, Also,
if a boy goes to the end of the first
week and still cannot decide about
a fraternity, then he can wait until
the second semester, knowing that
there will be an organized system
through which he can again see the
houses.

Another advantage of this system
is the fact that the boy who has not
pledged at the beginning of the first
‘erm will not be deprived of a social
life. His friends who have pledged
will certainly make every effort to
have him up at their house in order
that he will consider joining with
them,

In this system the fraternities can
plan their years as they always have,
while the freshman who has not
pledged will not feel that he has lost
1s chance for fraternity member-
ship. If the majority of the fresh-
men pledge during the first week.
‘hen this would seem to indicate that
no revision of our present rush sys-
‘em is really needed. But with the
‘ouble rush system, we can have
both deferred and first semester rush;
the attitude of the freshman decid-
ing which to choose.

Consequently, by putting the
choice to the freshman in the form
of two rush weeks, I feel that we will
be settling our problem as it should
be settled. The decision would be the
freshman’s, and since jt is he about
whom we are concerned, then the
result should be fair, He, not the
school or the fraternities, will decide
which style of rush is most popular
and reasonable, Those who do not
agree with the majority of the fresh-
men about which rush week to sign
up for, can, of course chose the
other—or both. Therefore the ma-

jority will be served as well as the
minority,

In the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi of

out the difference in price of two

He correctly described one, which I
edited, as “thin” and Priced at $2.95;
he also correctly described the other
as “big and thick” and priced at

was the Viking Press edition of Ho-

Tuesday’s Players of the Week

 

Lat Purser
Lat Purser, a 5°99”, 170 pound
halfback from Charlotte, North

Carolina, becomes the first freshman
to earn player of the week honors
this year for W&L. Lat earned his
recognition in the Generals’ game
last Saturday aaginst Sewanee by
leading the W&L rushing game, run-
ning for over 100 yards in his first
full time performance this season.

 

Chuck Kuhn

Accounting for all three General
touchdowns against Sewanee, Chuck
Kuhn earns player of the week
honors along with Purser. Chuck, a
senior Delt from Louisville, passed
for two W&L touchdowns and ran
across for the other General score.
Chuck had an excellent all-around
effort in the losing cause against the
Tigers.

Sewanee stuns Generals

By Mike Berry

Coach Buck Leslie of the W&L
Generals can surely say, “I told
you so.” All of last week Coach
Leslie held the fear that the Gen-
erals would underestimate the power
of the Sewanee Tigers. In spite of
what everyone said, he was correct
in his fears. The underdog Tigers
upset the Generals 37-21.

The Tigers, running from a sin-
gle wing offense, used a second half
surge to jump ahead in what had
been, in the first half, an evenly
fought battle. Highlighting the play
for the Tigers in the second half
were Bubba Owens and Keith Ball.

Owens scored on runs of 76 yards,
13 yards, and a one-yard plunge.
Bell ran in a 58 yarder that all bu
put the game out of reach of the
Generals.

WA&L's first score came on a pass
from Chuck Kuhn to Frank Stearns
Kuhn accounted for the rest of the
General touchdowns as he threw an
eleven yarder to Green and ran in
himself from three years out in the
final quarter. Jack Baizley kicked
all three extra points making him
eleven for eleven on the season.

The touchdown pass to Green
marked Green's fifth touchdown re-
ception of the year. However, the
Generals were unable to overcome
penalties, a blocked kick, and an in
terception; all of which led to their
eventual defeat.

This weekend's game pits W&l
against Southwestern. Not knowing
what the experts say, | would rate
the Generals a slight favorite, since
its W&L Parents’ Weekend. South
western will, however, be out to
kick the Generals while they
down.

The game should be interesting
since the Generals must win the
next two to go .500 in the Confer-
ence. Pick W&L by seven.

THE RING-TUM PHI

Six wins picked
up by Big Blue

By John Robinson

Friday afternoon saw Washington
and Lee’s sixth soccer victory over
West Virginia Wesleyan. The score
was 2-1 as the Generals left the field
of combat across the hills in West
Virginia. Now only two games are
left on the schedule-V.P.1. and Ran-
dolph-Macon.

The initial score developed in the
second quarter when attacker Don
Belt took an assist from Bryan Her-
bert to kick the ball beyond the
goalie’s reach. After this goal neith-
er team could gain an upper hand
and the score remained 1-0 at half-
time.

No score was credited to either
squad in the third period. However,
the fourth quarter brought about
plenty of action, An unassisted goal
was credited to John Yow early in
the last period boosting W&L’s lead
to 2-0. West Virginia Wesleyan
roared back on a free kick that was
converted into one point from the
left side. The late goal encouraged a
comeback by the Generals’ oppon-
ents but a stalwart defense turned
back the threat and kept the W&L
single point advantage safe.

Praise from Coach Lyles was giv-
en to John Yow for his fine offen-
sive play along with sophomore
Dave Manson, Hard work and hus-
tle made Dave one of the season’s
most improved players especially in
the last game.

Harriers

By Tom Rowe

Amid the ashes of the College
Athletic Conference cross-country
meet in which W&L did not distin-
guish itself come three observations
worth belaboring: 1) that Washing-
ton University has an outstanding
group of runners, 2) that Bob Sher-
wood’s sore throat was not condu-
cive to optimum performance, and
3) that Bill Wilkinson has emerged
as W&L’s best for 1969, at least.

Background material goes like
this: The verdict of the five-team
meet on a four-mile course was
Washington 20, Centre 47, Wash-
ington and Lee and Southwestern
tied at 91, and Sewanee 100. The
meet was held Saturday, the first of
the month, at Southwestern. W&L
did not do badly in tying Southwes-
tern and beating Sewanee, but the
chase after Centre proved futile and
disappointing in light of a better per-
formance in a duel meet with the
Colonels in October, Wilkinson pac-
ed the Generals at 21:15, 7th over-
all of 35 runners. Carter Glass shot
into 2nd for W&L, his best finish
of the year and 19th overall. Sher-
wood was 20th, Dave Haydu 22nd.

First in every way was Washing-
ton University. Their man, Martin
Ruddock, was first at 20:42. Wash-
ington runners also took second,
third, and fourth. Ruddock was gone
after the first mile, impassable. The
adjective used most often by the
survivors of Washington's lightning
was “outclassed”. Washington domi-

V.M.L. Keydets vs. Generals?

By John Robinson
Sports Editor

Often the athletic department has
had transportation problems when
it came to scheduling opponents.
Also, it has been difficult for many
of the teams to identify some of our
opponents as “rivals.” The C.A.€
cams that the Generals face often
require transportation by airplane
that costs the students time and the
university money.

It seems that someone has dis-
covered a new opponent that is
about our size and is so close the
time wasted in travelling would be

Well in truth, we really haven't

curately you might say we renewed
a rivalry. For over 65 years the
Keydets and the Minks haven't had
an official game. The only athletic
contact that has been maintained
was by minor sports that occasion-
ally scrimmaged. Notably the base-

ball, soccer, and lacrosse squads
would hold pre-season practice

The team which ventured the chal-
lenge was the soccer squad. The

Sherwood was unhappy with his
performance, the latest in a series of
declines. He admits a combination of
physical and mental strain, the na-
tural result of an athlete faced with
the typical freshman’s academic
grind. But reliable sources will tell
you further that Sherwood was sick
Saturday, with a sore throat and per-
haps a virus. It is difficult to run
four miles with a sore throat. Co-
captain Haydu felt rocky from the
plane trip down and so was not up
to par either.

Sherwood’s slump is Wilkinson's
surge. Wilkinson is now established
as W&L’s number one runner, but
he insists that his role is pro tem.
Sherwood is a mechanically better

place third in C.A.C.

and more experienced runner and
should be top next year. This is
good, according to Wilkinson. His
reasoning is that the number one
man leads the team, and the remain-
ing runners pace themselves behind
the front man, who in turn guides
them. Sherwood ran for four years
before coming to W&L, in contrast
to Wilkinson, a junior who had
never run at all before this year.
Therefore, Sherwood is more quali-
fied to pace the team with his know-
how. Wilkinson feels extra pressure
in his unaccustomed role and says
he'll be happier when Sherwood in-
evitably regains first place, and Wil-
kinson can follow behind him, a sort
of tandem that is the basis for a

Booters win

(Continued from Page 3)

After the game, West Virginia
Wesleyan was quickly rated as a
good soccer club particularly at the
inside positions, Actually they had
more chances to score than Wash-
ington and Lee and attempted sub-
stantially more shots.

At the present moment W&L must
work on a problem of ball control
to display the powerful brand of
play of which it is capable. Despite
that drawback the future looks very
bright for the Blue booters.

Good news has been received just
recently concerning the soccer team.
It has been learned that once again
Washington and Lee is being con-
sidered for a bid to the NCAA Col-
lege Division Atlantic Coast Re-
gionals on November 14-15. And of
course the chances are still bright
for a championship in the Western
Virginia Region. These last two
matches, needless to say, will make
all the difference.

By Reed Byrum

The Troub performance of Pin-
ter’s “The Homecoming” was prac-
tically faultless, an amazing fact
since half of the cast was participat-
ing in their first collegiate produc-
tion,

Dave Christovich’s characteriza-
tion of Max was excellent; by the
end of the play, he seemed to have
completely transformed himself into
the frusirated old man. Wes Pull-
man’s premiere came off surprising-
ly well, as he communicated the
image of the slick and rebuked mid-
dle son perfectly. At times, perhaps,
he attempted to be too cool, but this
was perhaps because of his theatri-
cal naivete,

Bob Carrere was great, when one
considers that too was his first Troub
production, He translated the being
of the frail Uncle Sam totally, both
physically and spiritually, Hugh
Hills previous experience in the
theatre showed true in his portrayal
of the super-straight husband. Mike
Leary also came over well in his
characterization of the pug boxer.

Karen Thorpe, new to W&L pro-
ductions, was a little too unemo
tional in her part; she also pondered
on things too long, when depth was
assuredly not to be a part of he:
personality, Her lying-on-her-back-
and-taking-it-without-a-smile attitude
was transmitted beautifully, but was
occasionally too extreme.

The physical aspects of the pro
duction failed to attain the high
standards of the acting. First of all,
the lighting was extremely poor,
hitting the actors just below the
shoulders; this cast a horrible glare
upon their faces. The lights caused
the make-up to show and made the

actors look like actors, instead of
people. This was best exemplified
by Christovich’s make-up, which, al-
though applied well, seemed too
heavy and loud under the lights,

The size limitations imposed by
the theater were sad, as the cast,
when all on the stage, seemed
cramped, More room would have
aided the production, as the props
and the actors could have been more
pleasingly situated,

rhe set design was exquisite and
beautifully done. The walls looked
especially impressive, and the furni
ture, even with the lack of space,
was Well placed.

The production in general was
great and makes one relish happily
