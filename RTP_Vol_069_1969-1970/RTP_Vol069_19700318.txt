LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA, MARCH 18, 1970

 

Members of the cast for “The Resistable Rise of Arturo Ui” rehearse a gangster massacre in a scene from
their upcoming production.

Troubs Perform “Ui” Next Week

On Tuesday March 24 at 8:30
p.m., the Troubadour Theatre will
offer its first performance of Ber-
tolt Brecht’s “The Resistable Rise
of Arturo Ui.”

One of several plays in his Chic-
ago series, Brecht’s “Arturo Ui” de-
picts the rise of a small time gang-
ster to a big time syndicate boss
Throughout the play, parallels to
Hitler's career are evident.

The theatre had hoped that the
Broadway musical “Hair” would
have been released for amateur pro-
duction by January so that its pro
duction at W&L would have been
possible this spring. Unfortunately,
W&L audiences will not be able to
view “Hair” this year
cording to Lee Kahn, director of the
theatre, “the company who handle
the rights isn't going to release the
show for amateur production main
ly because of the road company
productions touring the country this
year. | would expect that we'll be
able to produce “Hair” next year,
barring any unforseen difficulties

When asked about his reaction to
“Ui”, Mr. Kahn remarked. “Il
think that the point Brecht is
ing to make is that people like |
will always be dominating
because the world tends to sit back

because, ac

others

and let these types of people con-
trol them. It’s a very exciting and
moving play.”

Kahn plans to add slides, movies,
and sound to the production to
heighten and emphasize the parallels

tween Ui and his henchmen ani
Hitler and his group of followers.

The farce element in the play is
also influenced by the language of
the characters: “One really doesn’t
expect to hear quotes from Shake-
speare coming out of the mouths of
underworld characters.” Mr. Kahn
also noted that the play’s style is
much like that of an Elizabethan
Chronicle play, with much fanfare
and decoration,

Cast for the play includes David
Katz as Ui, Bob Carrere as Old
Dogsborough, Mare Scott as Givola,

David Christovich as Giri, Hugh
Hill as Roma, Carr Garnett as
Clark, Walkie May as Sheet, An

drew Wyndham as the Actor, Nan
Duvall as Dockdaisy, Champe Leary
as the Woman, Pree Ray as Betty
Dulifeet.

Other players include Lawrence
McConnell, David Olson, Jim Man
gan, Richard Pilkinton, David
Waelder, Beach Vickers, Chuck

Cut Limits Removed,

Left to Professors’ Discretion

Washington and Lee's faculty
took action on the questions of class
absence and student eligibility for
extracurricular activities during a
special meeting held on Monday.

Beginning in September, 1970,
the current university-wide absence
policy will be replaced by a state-
ment making student attendance in
classes or labs a matter between the
student and the professor in that
particular class,

In authorizing the change the fac-
ulty’s statement read, “A student's
participation in the work of a course
is clearly a precondition of his re-
ceiving credit in that course. Be-
cause of the wide variety of courses
and teaching methods at Washing-
ton and Lee, the University recog-
nizes that the nature of a student's
participation in the work of a course
cannot be prescribed on a Univer-
sity-wide basis, For this reason class-
room attendance is not a matter
subject to regulation by the Uni-
versity.”

Currently, student absences are
limited, with self-determination of
cuts reserved generally to Dean’s
List students, students with senior or
junior standing or freshmen in up-
perclass courses.

The faculty action on the eligibil-
ity of students for extracurricular
activities came from a recommenda-
tion of the Student Affairs Commit-
tee that was endorsed by the Stu-
dent Body Executive Committee.
The new requirements will also take
effect in September, at the start of
the 1970-1971 academic year.

Beginning next year, “students
on academic probation are academi-
cally eligible to participate in no

more than one extracurricular activ-
ity, athletic or non-athletic, during
the period of their probation. The
term “extracurricular” applies to
playing or managing intercollegiate
athletics, participating in intercol-
legiate debate, or in musical and
dramatic organizations, and to work-
ing on the editorial and business
staffs of publications.

In a closely related measure con-
cerning eligibility within the Uni-
versity, all requirements for partici-
pation in intramural athletics will be
abolished beginning in September.

Under the current policy, which
will be maintained through June,
students on academic probation are
ineligible to participate in any “ex-

tracurricular activities.” The num-
ber of intramural sports in which
an individual may take part is based
on his academic standing.

Lewis G. John, Dean of Students,
said that the “basic rationale” be
hind the changes was to “put re-
sponsibility on the student to do
what is best for him.”

In other action at Monday's meet-
ing, the faculty elected Anthony
Moncrief Coyne, a senior from De-
catur, Ga., as valedictorian for the
graduating class of 1970. Coyne is
a candidate for both the B.A. in
philosophy and the B.S. in mathe-
matics, and has a grade point of
3.85 (on a 4.0 scale) through seven
semesters at Washington and Lee.

[FC Accepts Compromise
Plan For Deferred Rush

several weeks of
discussion was reached Monday
night when the IFC resolved the
question of adopting a deferred rush
plan. Prior to this meeting, two
plans for the program had _ been
submitted: the Cahn, Mathews, Leo-
nard Plan and the McConnell Plan
The basic difference between the
two plans was that of contact, that
is limited versus unlimited.

The climax of

A special meeting was called on
Sunday night and the various fra-
ternities were invited to attend.
From this meeting came the com-
promise: the Cahn, Mathews, Leo-
nard, McConnell, Catlin, Gossman
Plan. This plan restricts contact to

EC Approves Admission Report

By Steve Ory

Ihe Executive Committee took
final action on their part concerning
the report on the recruitment of
underprivileged students by recom-
mending that the study be consid-
ered by the faculty Admissions
Committee. The motion to accept
an amended version of the report
was passed 9-1 by the EC.

Sophomore Bill Andrews who
cast the only dissenting vote com-
mented that he objected to “change
for change’s sake, which I feel is
part of the reason for the report.”
Andrews also remarked that he con-
sidered the report as a challenge to
the identity of W&L, which he de-
scribed as “a unique institution that
is characterized by southern gen
tlemen personified by Robert E,
Lee.”

Staman Ogilvie sent in a proxy
vole against the motion to accept
the report. The proxy vote was not
honored because it made no pro
vision for an amendment which
passed earlier.

The amendment to the report sti
pulated that 1) graduation require
ments not be reduced for underprivi

leged students; 2) each underprivi-
leged student be assigned a faculty
advisor to whom the student would
report his progress regularly during
his first semester; and 3) the stu-
dent and advisor will decide
whether or not to terminate this re-
lationship at the end of the first se-
mester.

The amendment passed 7-3 with
Andrews, Drew Kumpuris, and
Dave Bethea opposed. John Mark-
ham, who sponsored the amend-
ment, explained “the emphasis
should be on guidance rather than
permissiveness.”

The committee unanimously ap-
proved Bethea’s motion that the
Student Curriculum Committee's
“Tentative Proposal for an Indepen-
dent Examination Schedule” be rati-
fied by the EC. This proposal will
now go to the Faculty Curriculum
Committee which is considering an

exam schedule adapted to the
shorter time period in the new
calendar,

Joe Tompkins introduced a pro-
posal calling for an at-large student
representative to the Publications
Board. He felt that such a repre-

sentative would make the Publica-
tions Board more sensitive to the
sentiments of the student body.

Dean Kumpuris proposed an
amendment providing that the selec-
tion of such a representative should
be by a joint committee consisting
of three members each from the
Publications Board and the EC. He
noted that “a school-wide election
for such a post would be farcical.”

Henberg ruled the motion out of
order since the constitution gives the
EC only appellate jurisdiction over
the Publications Board. Dobbins
then moved that the EC forward
the proposal to the Board inthe
form of a suggestion. Dobbins’ mo-
tion and the Kumpuris amendment
were both carried.

A committee was established on
the suggestion of Phil Thompson to
investigate the possibility of a law
student being appointed a full-vot
ing member of the Board of Trus
tees. The committee will consist of
Alan Prater, Drew Kumpuris,
Thompson, and a few members to
be designated from the Law Schoo!

a greater degree than did the ori-
ginal Cahn, Mathews, Leonard Plan.
It was this plan that was submitted
to the IFC as a proposal.

Discussion of the proposal cen-
tered around the contact issue.
Chuck Cahn, President of the IFC
said that after being on the Rush
Committee for two years he had
seen every rushing rule broken. He
stated that this one would be too,
and there is no real reason in adopt-
ing a rule if it will be broken. Larry
Honig, President of Kappa Alpha,
said, “There’s no point in forcing a
situation. Limited rush is a
specious thing. We have an obliga-
tion to integrate freshmen into the
university community.”

Reeve Kelsey, President of Delta
Upsilon, spoke in favor of limited
contact when he pointed out that
the unlimited contact propsal im-
plied maturity on the part of the
fraternities. Jay Wetsel, Secretary of
the IFC, stated that the competition
would be as keen for seven weeks as
it was during the one week in past
years. “I can’t see competition les-
sening,” he said.

After discussion on the proposal,
the question was called. The com
promise proposal, embodying limit
ed contact passed the IFC by a vote
of 11-4-1.

In other business, the IFC voted
to abolish the 2.0 grade point ratio
it had previously required for initia
tion. This provision was passed by
the faculty last week.

Andrew Wyndham
Squires presented a resolution to
the IFC calling for the abolishment
of housemothers, whom they termed
as “anachronistic, a financial
burden.” They felt that with the new
parietal rules the housemothers

and Mac

served no real purpose and were
serving in loco parentis. The pro-
posal passed the IFC and will be

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi
Wednesday, March 18, 1970

An Unnecessary Compromise

The Interfraternity Council’s acceptance
of a compromise deferred pledging proposal
was probably the best they could do, given
the three alternatives to which they limited
themselves. Unfortunately, this plan incor-
porates some of the most serious defects in
both the other proposals, and the limiting of
scope to the three plans presented seems to
be dictated by fatigue and indifference rather
than by necessity.

The conflict between the two original
plans arose over the question of whether con-
tact between fraternity men and _ rushees
should be limited, and if so, how much. The
first plan allowed in effect unlimited contact
and provided for formal rush activities on
the weekends. The second placed rather se-
vere limitations on contact and included
rush dates on week nights. The compromise
plan, by requiring enough restrictions and
scheduling formal rush activities only on
weekends, hopes the academically deleterious
effects of rush will be minimized.

The difficulty is that, because open
houses are still scheduled before classes start,
W&L’s social aspects will retain at least a
chronological primacy over the academic,
and it is that primacy on every level that a

system of deferred rushing was to correct.

Probably at least as great a problem is
the more practical one of enforcement. Pres-
ent rush rules are not presently observed or
enforced, and we find no indication that they
will be under the new system. Danny Leo-
nard argued that the steeply graduated fin-
ing system would make violations prohibi-
tive, but we find it just as likely that because
of the “high cost of justice’ the Judicial
Board will be hesitant to impose any penalty.

On the other hand, the limited contact
rule, if it is enforced, will allow fraternities to
promote a false image much as they pres-
ently do and will not then deal with the need
for a more rational selection process, another
major reason for changing the rules.

The alternative which was patently ig-
nored is that of a rush beginning second se-
mester with open contact first semester. As
we suggested last week, the absence of a for-
mal structure first semester would remove the
likelihood of the feared “escalation of ir-
responsibility” in rush while providing the
possibility for an open assessment of the al-
ternatives available and for the establishment
of academics as the student’s first concern.

R. L. E.

A Matter of Respect

The student body Executive Committee’s
recent suggestion to the Publications Board
that it include as a voting member a student
chosen at large is laudable, and it deserves
acceptance by the Board.

Unfortunately the resolution presented
by Student Body Vice-President Joe Tomp-
kins was amended to provide for selection
by a panel of three EC members and three
members of the Publications Board, instead
of election by the vote of the student body,
which was Tompkins’ suggestion.

The arguments against an open election
do have some validity, but they are in gen-
eral based on a more cynical view of the stu-
dents than we think the facts warrant. The
objection is that students would not elect a
responsible representative. Yet those fears
were not sufficient to kill a similar proposal
regarding election of the Dance Board vice-
president, and we fail to see a substantive
difference in the responsibilities of the posi-
tions. In fact, it seems to us that students
would likely be more interested in the re-
sponsible supervision of publications for

which they are taxed than they would be
concerned about the functioning of the
Dance Board, to which they can subscribe or
not.

Assuming then that students will take
the position seriously, the direct election of
the representative would seem to be a more
effective approach to answering the need for
publications more responsive to the students.
Not only is it more democratic and less trou-
blesome for an already overworked EC, but
an elected student is more likely to have to
formulate ideas on which he can base a cam-
paign and to be more accessible, because
more known, to the students he represents.

The EC, because of its own magnanim-
ous gesture in the fall to revoke its control
over the Publications Board, does not have
the final say in the matter. The Board may
refuse to act on the suggestion, or it may,
if it recognizes the problem, choose another
means to rectify it. We hope it will have
more respect for its fellow students than
their elected representatives have exhibited
in raising the issue. R.L.E,

A Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing

By adopting the faculty Executive Com-
mittee’s proposals concerning sophomore
and freshmen cuts, the faculty has made the
tragic mistake of liberalizing a rule to the
point where it has the potential to become
dangerously reactionary.

Both pro under consideration by
the faculty would have granted more free-
dom in the matter of class attendance to
freshmen and sophomores. However, the
more conservative of the two proposals, that
of the Committee on Courses and Degrees,
was more in line with previous University
philosophy concerning cuts, and was, in fact,
more protective of the rights of students.

Under the Courses and Degrees proposal
freshmen and sophomores in lower level
courses would be allowed six absences per
semester in a three-hour course. While this
number is the same as is currently allowed,
it must be noted that next year a semester
will be only twelve weeks in duration as com-
pared with the present fifteen week semester.
Hence, more frequent absences would be al-
lowed.

The penalty for over-cutting would be
the loss of one letter grade in that course.
However, as is currently the case, suspen-
sion of the penalty would be left to the dis.
cretion of the professor.

The faculty Executive Committee pro-
posal, which was accepted, represents a radi-
cal departure from the philosophy of the
Courses and Degrees proposal and the pres-
ent absence structure. The new plan creates
what at first glance seems a utopian paradise
for all underclassmen. Attendance will be

left to the discretion of the professor.

But in reality, this does not mean that re-
quired attendance will become a thing of the
past. Assuredly, many of the professors on
campus will choose not to restrict cuts. Such
a course of action is the most convenient and
least time-consuming, but it is not the only
course of action.

Just as a professor might decide to ig-
nore absences, he might choose not to allow
them, or to allow only a minimal number.
This latter possibility is not inconceivable,

By liberalizing absence regulations per-
taining to underclassmen in recent years, the
faculty has demonstrated that it believes stu-
dents should be allowed a degree of freedom
regarding attendance. It will now be possible
for a minority of professors to counter the
philosophy of the faculty as a body.

And with what consequences? Under the
new regulations, the penalty for over-cutting
will be whatever the professor deems ap-
propriate. The great danger is that it will be
possible for a professor to arbitrarily fail a
student for over-cutting. Professors who will
allow the least excused absences will prob-
ably impose the sternest penalities, as they
would be the ones who have the greatest dis-
taste for absentee students.

Whether a liberalization of underclass.
men's absence privileges was necessary is ir-
relevant to the matter. By bending over
backwards to insure that professors and stu-
dents are given the utmost freedom in the
area of attendance, the faculty may very
well have achieved the opposite of what it in-

tended, R.D.C,

Bethea, Azuma Defend
EC Admissions Report

By Glenn Azuma and
David Bethea
Chairmen, EC Admissions
Committee

At a time when the educational
process in America is subject to
great changes, there are those who
feel that many of the changes are
unwarranted. And often, when we
see the changes in historical per-
spective, we conclude that resistance
to them is justified.

However, there are some changes
that should not be resisted and in
our case cannot be neglected any
longer.

Traditionally, Washington and
Lee has offered an excellent scholas-
tic education. However, this form
of learning does not constitute the
entire educational experience of col-
lege. An equally important part of
this learning exists outside the lec-
ture hall and laboratory; this can
only be termed “experimental” edu-
cation,

In a college with a student body
coming from basically the same cul-
tural, social, and environmental ex-
perience, the interchange of differ-
ent philosophies and perspectives is
limited. It is unfortunate that Wash-
ington and Lee offers good formal
education but neglects that aspect
of learning which is informal and
experiential.

A program for the recruitment of
academically qualified, underprivi-
leged students hopefully will com-
plete that part of our education
which has been neglected. The fact
that in the past we have not offered
opportunities for this learning may
have contributed to the lessening
attractiveness of this school, as wit-
nessed by the recent yearly decline
in the number of prospective stu-
dents.

The committee has suggested that
in the evaluation of underprivileged
students SAT scores be de-empha-
sized. It is a fact that the SAT
tests have come under increasing
criticism in recent years as the pri-
mary criterion in college admis-

sions. It is also generally affirmed
that these tests are geared toward a
particular economic and _ social
group.

This objective form of testing
operates on a cultural bias that con-
sequently challenges the value of
their conclusions. Objective tests
which are more valuable indicators
of a student’s intelligence and abil-
ity are available and are suggested
by the committee. The Wechsler In-
telligence Scale and the Omnibus
Personality Inventory are less cul-
turally and socially limited than the
SAT’s and are more valid indicators
of the intelligence and capabilities
of these students,

It has been suggested that high
school performance and class rank
be utilized to a greater extent in the
evaluation. These have been proven
to bear a closer correlation with
performance in college. The com-
mittee proposals are hardly radical
departures from current admissions
thought. Throughout the nation
SAT scores have come under care-
ful scrutiny. Some colleges, such as
Bowdoin, have gone so far as to
disregard them altogether. This is
not our suggestion.

We realize that all available data
has some place in the evaluation of
prospective students. However, in
the case of culturally and socially
deprived students, it has been pro-
ven that SAT’s circumscribe their

Letters to The Editor

A Closed Society”

To the editor of the Ring-tum Phi:

It appears according to a recent
editorial in this newspaper that
Washington and Lee is and will re-
main a closed society.

The editors of the paper believe
that this “is a school for snobs, but
it’s good academically.” They go on
to say that it is not our part to re-
cruit underprivileged students and
that it is not our obligation or re-
sponsibility to undertake this.

How self-righteous can we be to
say that culturally underprivileged
students have no place in this uni-
versity community? Are we going to
ignore the reality that our society
has been closed to many individuals
and that tests such as the SAT are
oriented to a middle class upbring-
ing?

It may not be the responsibility
of a private institution to give some
of these students a chance to at-
tend a small liberal arts college, but
it is our responsibility as human
beings and as a university to main-
tain an open intellectual community,
not a closed society for snobs.

The educational purpose of this
university as stated by the Board of
Trustees “stresses the importance of
the individual, his personal honor,
and integrity .. . and his responsibil-
ity to serve society through the pro-
ductivity of his training and his tal-
ent.” Is this university, and are we
as students, serving society by re-
stricting this university to those who
fulfill the accepted standards of hav-
ing grown up in a middle class en-
vironment? Are we being truly pro-
ductive by maintaining a closed
society?

Now is the time for Washington
and Lee to live up to its purpose as
a university, which is to give all
persons who have the potential of
making a contribution to this uni-
versity and to society a chance to
fulfill that potential

This is what should be the criter-
ion for becoming a member of this
university community, not whether
a person can meet middle class cul-
tural standards,

As Eric Hoffer so well stated,
“Our healing gift to the weak is
the capacity for self-help,” not the
closing of our doors.

objective utility. Therefore, it is our
suggestion that we acknowledge the
liabilities of the SAT’s and place
their results in proper perspective.
The underprivileged student ad-
mitted to Washington and Lee will
still be highly qualified, but his
qualifications (including class rank
and recommendations) will not be
judged with preponderant emphasis
on SAT scores.

The Freshman year in college is
a difficult time of adjustment for all
incoming students. The process of
assimilation, that is, of acclimating
one’s self to a new environment, is
not insuperable in itself. However,
this in addition to the inevitable
academic pressures common to all
first year students may prove overly
demanding.

It is with this fact in mind that
the committee has suggested the in-
stitution of a summer and transi-
tional year program. The two pro-
grams are not designed to cram in
twelve years of primary and sec-
ondary education (for that will not
be required), but rather to ease the
social and cultural transition into
college living. A slightly more in-
tensive program of counselling will
be offered for this purpose of ad-
justment,

These programs are not an ac-
knowledgement of unequal status.
Although it is a difficult concept to
express, we feel that a man may
have knowledge of his weaknesses
and not feel inferior.

The problems which face Wash-
ington and Lee in the establishment
of this program cannot be ignored.
The most crucial one of funding is
obvious, but from our conversations
with the Dean of Financial Aid and
the Director of University Planning
and Development it is not without
solution.

We welcome all responsible criti-
cism concerning the committee's re-
port. It is our hope that this reply
will set a tone of rational and con-
structive dialogue leading to valu-
able change at Washington and Lee.

coverage of the convention; the
Florida press would certainly be
there to record the participation of
its favorite son and governor, Claude
Kirk. Richard Nixon himself had
already agreed to speak to the con-
vention via telephone hook-up if
he won the nomination. Yes, order
was important to the members of
the Mock Convention Steering Com-
mittee who met in that room that
night,

The potential difficulty was this:
the California delegation was prob-
ably going to give first ballot sup-
port to Nixon because at that time
Ronald Reagan would not declare as
a candidate. Led by a very vocal
supporter, the Reagan for President
committee On campus attempted to
prove its right to cast the California
delegation’s votes for their hand-
some hero, Their proof was rejected
by the Convention leadership, and
now what was feared was a pos-
sible request by Reagan for Presi-
dent supporters to poll all of the
California delegates in the hope that
a majority would be for Reagan
and thus force the whole of the
California vote to go for Ronald
Reagan under the unit rule.

This would be a legitimate re-
quest according to the rules of the
1964 Republican Convention in San
Francisco which the Steering Com-
mittee hoped to have accepted by
the WAL convention to free them
from the task of drawing up a new
set of rules.

The question then raised by the
concerned convention leaders was
what to do. Saunders, with much
support all around, proposed that
two things be done. First, instruct
delegation chairman to have their
people clap and cheer whenever
Eisenhower's name was mentioned:
then, have a mention of Eisenhow-
er's name inserted in the siatement
which said all rules from the ‘64
Convention would be accepted ex-
cept the one allowing requests for a
poll of the delegates,

This way, it was reasoned, when
the chair called for a voice vote on
the rules, the cheers from the men
tion of Eisenhower's name would be
enough to allow the secretary of
the Convention to say, “the ayes
have it.” And the commotion caus
ed by enthusiastic cheering would
prevent the Reagan committee lead-
er from being heard even if he were

able to understand the railroad
move

It was a brilliant suggestion, |

After one year as Washington
and Lee Athletic Director, Gene
Corrigan has no regrets that he left
4 promising position as Assistant
Director of the Atlantic Coast Con-
ference to return to Lexington.
“None at all.”

I went over to archaic Doremus
Gymnasium last week to talk to Cor-
rigan about his job, As usual, he
was more than willing to take a few
minutes off to answer my questions.

Corrigan did not set any goals
for himself or for the university
when he became Athletic Director
“because I did not know what to
expect and any goal I might have
set could have been in the wrong
ball park.” However, he feels the
Athletic Department is making pro-
gress in many areas.

Work has finally begun on the
long-needed addition to the gym.

The tennis courts have been im-
proved,

Nine holes are being added to the
golf course.

The Athletic Department is mak-
ing ample use of alumni to help re-
cruit athletes.

Much of Corrigan’s time is devot-
ed to working with the many alumni
chapters. “Have you seen our alum-
ni pamphlet?” Without waiting for
an answer, he pulled a_ brochure
from a box and dropped it on my
lap. “We send a copy to every
alumnus who shows an interest in
the athletic program. If only 25 per
cent can help us recruit one athlete
a year, we will be doing real well.”

As Corrigan continued to talk, he
walked around his office, overcrowd-
ed with the wares of his trade—
books on all sports, pictures of ath-
letic teams, trophies (including the
railroad bell, symbol of overall
College Athletic Conference supre-
macy which has been won by W&L
the last two years), a box of tennis
rackets, samples of astroturf and
tartan turf, et al.

Although W&L is not involved
in “big time” athletics, Corrigan
feels there is no substitute for suc-
cess. “Winning and losing is very
important, I don’t know any other
way to judge the program. But the
boys are most important. They have
gone out to do something, and de-

serve all the credit when they su
ceed,”

“I’m more convinced than ever
that only our lack of ambition can
hold us back.” But Corrigan cannot
see any lack of ambition on the part
of his staff. “We have good coaches

. real fine people.”

In an attempt to re-evaluate the

athletic program, Corrigan has es-
tablished three committees which
will report their findings to him by
June 1. Coaches Szlasa, Leslie and
Canfield are studying recruiting to
determine the best possible way for
W&L to approach the task. “We are
looking for the same type of boy
that Dean Farrar is looking for. We
don’t want a boy who can’t stay in
here,”
_ The physical education program
is being studied by Coaches Stearns,
Davies and Lyles, and the intra-
murals program by Coaches Lord
and Aldrich.

“We don’t know that anything
dramatic will come out of these
studies, but I feel they should be
made.” The committees are taking a
close look at the type of programs
that are being carried out at other
colleges of all sizes.

Corrigan has found that his job
encompasses everything from the
coaches’ budget to the cleanliness of
buildings. He would like to delega‘e
more responsibility to his coaches,
but he has found that most prob-
lems come back to him in the end.
“I want to keep in touch with every
spect of the program.”

Is there any aspect he does not
enjoy? “None at all.”

when Ferlinghetti was arrested for
selling the Number One book of
beat poetry, Howl by Allen Gins-
berg.

Ferlinghetti was, and is, a major
figure in the “San Francisco Liter-
ary Renaissance.” He is founder
and owner of the City Lights Book-
store there, which was a center for
the way-out poets of the late fifties
and early sixties. He believed in
taking poetry out of its ivory tower
and putting it on the streets.

Poets were encouraged to read
their work in his store, coffee house
fashion. He imported Howl from
England for sale at City Lights and
was promptly charged with “know-
ingly offering an obscene book for
sale.” The resulting trial and publi-
city boomeranged on the officials by
attracting far greater attention to
the work and its marketer than he
could possibly have achieved through
conventional advertising.

Later, Ferlinghetti himself pub-
lished the book at his City Lights
Press. City Lights Press is a flour-
ishing business today and has issued
the work of a good many younger
poets, some of whom have gone on
to receive national attention. Among

peace and social progress” the OAS
has attempted to bring to the Wes-
tern Hemisphere.

The W&L Model OAS is a simu-
lated version of the real OAS, which
meets in Washington, D.C. This was
the first simulation of the OAS
General Assembly, which was
created by a new OAS charter rati-
fied Feb. 27.

The Model OAS met in its firsi
plenary session later Friday after-
noon to discuss the seating of the
Cuban delegation. Cuba has been
denied a seat in the OAS since
Fidel Castro came to power there.
The Model OAS rejected the at-
tempt to seat Cuba.

The Friday evening session was
prefaced by remarks from Joseph
Romanelli, an official from the U.S.
Department of State’s Public Af-
fairs Advisory Office.

Romanelli noted a change in the
role of the United States in Latin
American affairs. The Nixon ad-
ministration has attempted to em-
phasize United States cooperation
rather than dominance in the Inter-
American community, he said.

The basic issue for the evening
session was a border warfare crisis
between Guatemala and Mexico.
According to John Motsinger, sec-
retary-general of the Model OAS,

Mehl Favors
Recruiting Plans

By Walt Potter

John Mehl, director of financial
aid and placement, recently express-
ed a complimentary reaction to the
Executive Committee's report on the
recruitment of underprivileged stu-
dents,

The recommendations of the re-
port were approved with amend-
ments by the EC Monday night and
forwarded to the faculty Admissions
Committee. The report had been
prepared by a student committee
appointed by the EC.

Meh! termed his overall response
to the recommendations in the re-
port “positive.”

“First, | want to say that student
concern of this kind, especially actu
ally doing something about a prob-
lem as in this report, is excellent,”
he said.

“As for the report itself, I agree
in spirit with the body of the work.
| agree that it is necessary to have

crises such as this were planned be-
fore the formal sessions.

The value in presenting a crisis
such as the Guatemala-Mexico situa-
tion before the Model OAS lies in
the accuracy and speed with which
the delegates react to urgent situa-
tions, Motsinger said.

The crisis was solved by both
countries’ acceptance of an OAS ob-
servation team and a cease-fire line
between their borders.

The Saturday sessions were high-
lighted by a Peruvian motion which
urged the U.S. and the other Latin
American countries to accept fish-
ing rights within a 200-mile limit.
John McCarthy, a W&L sophomore
representing Peru, called for the ap-
proval of the OAS for the extension
in fishing rights.

Navy Comdr. Richard W. Ander-
son, who addressed the morning
session, asked McCarthy's permis-
sion for the U.S. delegation to the
OAS to use his speech as a basis for
future U.S. policy on the fishing
rights issue.

The Mexican delegation, from
East Carolina University, won the
honors as the best delegation at the
awards banquet Saturday evening.
Honorable mention was given to the
Peruvian delegation,

Border Warfare
Crisis Handled
By Model OAS

By Lawrence McConnell

John Motsinger, Secretary-Gen-
eral for the Model OAS, will be
quick to tell anyone that a simula-
tion such as the Model OAS will die
before it begins without a crisis for
delegates to cope with.

The purpose of the Model OAS,
according to Motsinger, is to simu-
late not only the procedure of the
actual OAS in Washington, D.C.,
but also the patterns of diplomatic
relations between the countries in
this hemisphere.

Through a study of the foreign
relations and internal affairs of their
respective countries, delegates should
be prepared to handle any conceiv-
able problem which might arise on
the Mock OAS floor. The crisis
situation forces delegates to react
quickly and decisively to an unex-
pected problem.

The major crisis of last week's
Model OAS was a border conflict
between Mexico and Guatemala,
which was brought to the attention
of the assembly Friday evening.
The following is an account of how
the crisis developed on the floor of
the OAS and how the delegations
solved the problems the crisis pre-
sented.

3 p.m.—The U.S. delegation is
informed by the CIA that guerrilla
activity in Guatemala is causing
conflict between Mexico and Guate-
mala, When Mexico and Guatemala
receive accounts of insurgent acti-
vity on their borders, both countries
substantively deny the reports.

10:15 p.m.—Both countries are
notified that communist guerillas are
retreating into Mexican territory
after a defeat by Guatemalan forces,

W &L Second in CAC

Strong performances in winter
sports have propelled Washington
University of St. Louis and Wash-
ington and Lee University into the
lead for the College Athletic Con-
ference overall championship.

Washington has a slim 2'-point
lead over W&L in the race for the
President’s Trophy, a huge bronze
bell symbolic of the conference
crown. WU has 87% points to 85
for W&L.

Centre College is a close third
with 75 points and Sewanee, Tenn.
is only 2% points back in fourth
place. Only last-place Southwestern
of Memphis appears out of the run-
ning with 55 points.

The points are awarded on the
basis of the schools’ finish in all ath-
letic competition, involving nine
sports. Ironically Washington U.

and W&L finished in a last-place tie
in football but came on strong in
the winter sports to take the overall
lead.

Washington and Lee won both
the basketball and swimming tour-
naments to garner most of its points,
while Washington U. finished sec-
ond in both wrestling and basket-
ball. Earlier the Bears had won the
cross-country competition.

Sewanee won the wrestling cham-
pionship and finished second in
swimming. Centre captured the foot-

Baseball Team Set

For Saturday Opener

Washington and Lee opens the baseball season Satur-
day, entertaining Long Island University in a double header.
It will be the Blackbirds’ first appearance on Smith Field

since 1968.

Following the Saturday action, the Generals host Cleve-
land State for single games Monday and Tuesday, round-
ing out the week with a single game March 26 with Bucknell.

Commenting on this weekend's
contest, head coach Joe Lyles de-
scribed LIU as a “good club all the
way. They're one of our top Op-
ponents.” After opening here at
WAL, the Blackbirds take on VMI
and Lynchburg next week.

Cleveland State returns to Wash-
ington and Lee for the third year
in a row. Last year the Generals
split a double header with the Ohio
school after winning a single game
back in 1968.

The Generals readied for their
opening encounters by scrimmaging
VMI at the Keydets’ fields last Fri-
day. The “A” squad dropped a tight
3-1 decision, but the “B” squad
countered with a 5-2 victory.

Speaking of the first game, coach
Lyles commented, “Left on bases
and walks killed us. We just couldn't
put it together.” Although the Gen-
erals outhit the Keydets, 6-2, W&L
lacked a key hit with men in posi-
tion to score.

However, coach Lyles liked the
pitching performances. “(Haller)
Jackson pitched good ball, and so
did (Bill) Miller and (Tim) Haley,”
he said.

The Generals “B” squad took ad-
vantage of wild VMI hurlers to post
their 5-2 win. Rich Murray's two
hits, along with timely raps by
Chris Coursen and Doug Clelan,

"

produced four runs. Don Bock and
Don McMillan performed well on
the mound.

Coach Lyles noted that in both
games a score was the result of the
inning’s lead off man getting on
base, either by a walk or by a base
hit.

Last year as a freshman “un-
known” at WA&L, Clark finished
second in an intramural swim meet,
prompting a visit by W&L swim-
ming coach Bill Stearns.

At Stearns’ urging, Clark tried
out for the team, and by the end
of the year was voted the Most Im-
proved Swimmer award. And this
year, he has broken all the school,
pool and conference records in both
the 100- and 200-yard butterfly
events.

His times have been so good, in
fact, that he has qualified for the
national college division swimming
meet next week in Rochester, Mich.
There, the top college division swim-
mers in the country will compete
for All-America honors.

Clark’s success has led Coach
Stearns to return again to the in-
tramural ranks. This year he dis
covered another freshman, Price
Blackford, who placed second in
both the 100- and 200-yard breast
siroke events of the conference mee!
and swam a leg on the champion-
ship medley relay team which broke
the conference record.

Coach Stearns says the same
thing this year of Blackford that he
said last year of Clark: “He's got
great potential.”

The pair of youthful swimmers
have had a major role in leading
WAL to a 5-2 season record, the
conference championship and the
runner-up spot in the Virginia state
meet, Washington and Lee has not
had a losing season in swimming
since before World War I

Speaking My Mind

UCLA To Win Title Again

By Tom Gage
Sports Editor

And then there were four, The
prestigious NCAA ordeal has some-
how battered its way through the
consequences of a treacherous ACC
tournament, the fall of its big-name
team, Kentucky, the fall of even its
big-name Bob Lanier of St. Bona-
venture, and come up with four very
unique yet four very good teams.
Wending their way this week to Col-
lege Park, Maryland, for the pur-
pose of staking out their claim as
national collegiate basketball kings
are the proud Bruins of UCLA,
Jacksonville’s “nouveau” Dolphins,
the wounded Bonnies of St. Bona-
venture, and the ambitious Aggies
of New Mexico State.

Let’s take UCLA first. Where's
the low-post offense that was so fa-
miliar to us for three long years?
It's in Milwaukee, that’s where,
leading the NBA Bucks to a pos-
sible title. But the Bruins are play-
ing “who-needs-him” quite success-
fully. It'll be a high-post that we'll
see this time with guards Henry
Bibby and John Vallely feeding off
to their forwards or pumping it in
themselves. Center Steve Patterson
is hardly the mainspring that Al-
cinder was and the team suffered
just terribly for it. Two losses!
UCLA has annihilated Long Beach
State and Utah State to earn its
place at College Park. In the semi’s
on Thursday they'll meet New
Mexico State.

The Aggies are different this year
for the simple fact that they actu-
ally made it past the regionals.
After coming up empty the last two
years, it was about time. With fin-
gers crossed and rabbits’ feet in
their pockets, the staff at State had
hoped for and got their long desired
classification as a Mid-Western team
rather than Western. UCLA would
be playing on the other side of the
mountains and would stay there
until paths would cross and the
twain would meet at the University
of Maryland fieldhouse! In the ex-
citement the Aggies almost got
bowled over by a husky Kansas
State team but were able to squeak
by, 70-66. Then it was an easy vic-
tory over perennial upstart Drake
87-78 and on to meet the reigning
champs, UCLA. The bubble will
pop here, however. The Bruins have
never taken any nonsense from the
Aggie’s even when they ran that
bothersome slowdown game and
will probably have no trouble with
State’s fast game which will un-
doubtedly be on the docket for
Thursday's semi-final. Jimmy Col-
lins and his teammates will take
home bigger trophies this year but
still not the biggest as UCLA is the
one in this game by 10.

This will be the late game on
Thursday and many say that it will
be following a mismatch, the Jack-
sonville-St. Bonaventure game. For
Jacksonville, the uniqueness, the un-
orthodoxy lies in the questions,
“Who are they,” and “Hey, where
did they come from.” Unknown and
unheeded, the Dolphins now are a
basketball power, with no indication
of being a fluke concoction of play-
ers whose opportunism might over-
shadow the basic quality of the
team. Joe Williams, coach of Jack-
sonville, can blow the Bonnies off
the court if he so wishes, but it'll be
too bad if this happens, for it would
not be a true indication of just how
good this Bonaventure team had
been all season . . . with a healthy

game is pretty much even here.
Both teams have their sparkplugs,
Kalbaugh for St. Bonaventure and
Dublin for Jacksonville. But oh!
the forwards, Without Lanier there
is absolutely no height whatsoever
up front for the Bonnies. If they put
5°10” Kalbaugh on forward Matt
Gantt’s shoulders, there might be
enough there to effectively cover
72” Artis Gilmore. But who would
cover 70” Pembrook Burrows then?
Although there’s a sneaking suspi-
cion that Burrows doesn’t command
all that much defense, the Bonnies
will have their hands full all the
same.

For St. Bonaventure it’s a tragic
uniqueness that characterizes the
team. Their big man will not play.
As Lanier went, so went the Bon-
nies. When he was hot, the team
was hot. And Bob Lanier stayed hot

Generals prepare for first game by scrimmaging tough Yale team,

Stickmen Scrimmage

“The Lacrosse team will be well
prepared to take on their divisional
teams, Once the season begins,” ac-
cording to coach Szlasa. Having
faced a variety of formidable op-
ponents in scrimmages, Washington
and Lee is already a seasoned team.
Scrimmages must be judged in their
proper perspective. What's impor-
tant is not which team wins or loses,
but the amount of experience gain-
ed. It is in scrimmages that coaches
experiment by using different com-
binations or playing different peo-
ple.

Last Sunday, W&L played Ran-
dolph-Macon, employing a southern
style of offense, which consisted of
cutting and feeding. Unlike the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania’s northern,
dodging style of offense, a Ran-
dolph-Macon player would cut and
place himself in a good shooting
position in front of the goal, while
his teammates would throw him the
ball. On the Yellowjacket team
there was tremendous talent, against
which the Generals fared well, with
the game ending in a 6-6 tie.

On March 16, the Generals went
against Yale, the toughest team
they've played to date. Coached by
an alumnus of Washington and Lee,

Coach McHenry, Yale provided
great competition. Its players were
strong and good-sized. The Bulldog
defense pressed W&L while its of-
fense used both dodging and cutting-
feeding techniques. All of its play-
ers hit hard, three of them having
been excellent football players.
Against Yale, Billy Ingersoll, Whit
Morrill, Chip Tompkins, Sam In-
glehart, and Tommy Groton all did
a creditable job.

Most of the teams on W&L’s
schedule use a patterned offense,
where individual skill can be utiliz-
ed effectively. A tall fellow will be
placed near the goal so he can make
shots, while the shorter, faster men
will be outside the goal area, so they
can create a One to one situation.
All the teams we have played use
a man-for-man defense. In the event
that a defenseman loses his man.
other defensemen slide over to cover.
Hitting is another aspect of la-
crosse, as those who witnessed the
Yale scrimmage will attest to. Al-
though important as a morale fac-
tor, hitting must be controlled, so
that by putting an opponent out of
action for a few seconds, your team
can come up with the ball. In close
games, hitting increases.

College YR’s
of Virginia
Elect Seaton

The College Republican Federa-
tion of Virginia elected as its Chair-
man Cal Seaton, a sophomore eco-
nomics major.

Three hundred delegates, meeting
March 7 in Natural Bridge, chose
Seaton unanimously after his op-
ponent from Old Dominion College
withdrew.

Washington and Lee received
other honors as well. The Conven-
tion awarded a tie for Best Virginia
College Republican Club to the
W&L Young Republicans and the
W&L Law School Young Republi-
cans. Virginia Military Institute was
chosen as first runner-up.

The award for Best College Re-

educational value for the student
body. I think the committee was
wise to point out that the recruit
ment of underprivileged students
would be for our own benefit.

“Generally the report pinned
down the problems, as when it point-
ed out that the financial aspect is
the most crucial and formidable
point of the program,” he added.

Pointing out that a major cam-
paign for contributions would be
needed to support the program, Mehl
estimated that “We would have to
go with five or six underprivileged
students for the next few years be-
fore we cduld do anything like 10 a
year.”

Mehl agreed with the report's
contention that college board scores
should not be given as much weight
in relation to high school records
in admissions decisions as they are
now, citing a statement by the Col-
lege Entrance Examination Board
that such tests should not be “the
chief instrument for determining the
proper selection of minority low-in-
come students.”

academic basis, a student who ha»
failed to maintain a 2.0 average
would probably not be selected.
Any counselor who goes on Aca-
demic Probation after being selected
will be asked to resign.

The awards of Counselorship are
not based on financial need, How-
ever, in order to ensure the greatest
possible contact with freshmen,
Counselors are provided with a sin-
gle room in the dormitory and din-
ner meal in Evans Dining Hall,
which they are expected to eat with
freshmen. Each Counselor will also
be expected to live in his dormi-
tory room seven nights a week,
rather than spending nights in any
outside apartment.

The primary basis of selection of
Counselors will be that of general
fitness to aid in making the Fresh-
man Dormitory an adequate en-
vironment for a student’s freshman
year.

Students who are presently Dormi-
tory Counselors and who wish to
return next year should submit let-
ters to this effect to the Dean of
Students’ office before Saturday,
March 21. In addition, returning
Counselors should indicate in their
letter if they wish to apply for Head
Counselor or Assistant Head Coun-
selor,

New applications for this position
of counselor in any of the Univer-
sity dormitories should be filed in
person in the office of the Dean of
Students by Saturday, March 21,
and should include information that
will be helpful to the Selection
Committee. Further details concern-
ing duties and responsibilities can
be obtained from Michael T. Thorn-
ton, Head Dormitory Counselor,
and Waugh Crigler, Homer Gam-
ble, David Kympton, John Nolan,
Assistant Head Dormitory Coun
selors, all members of the Selec-
tion Committee.

Pianist To Play Tonight

The Concert Guild of Washing-
ton and Lee University will present
a piano lecture-recital tonight by
Miss Anne McClenny, associate
professor of music and chairman of
the Division of Fine Arts at Hollins
College.

The presentation will be held at
8 p.m. in Lee Chapel on the Wash-
inton and Lee campus.

In her lecture-recital, “America’s
Musical Heritage,” Miss McClenny
will play rarely-heard works by
Alexander Reinagle, Raynor Taylor
and Benjamin Carr, all of whom
were active in America immediately
after the Revolutionary War. Many
of the compositions have not been
published since the 18th century and
therefore had to be edited from the
early printings.

been popular on college campuses.

we were very realistic that year

and found myself in complete agree-
ment with the suggestion. We all
were looking at the situation from
the perspective of order—we de
sired an orderly affair—and we fail-
ed to see that we were fixing the
game totally disregarding the rights
of the delegates and potential candi-
dates.

That we made a mistake was ob
vious to anyone who could be ob
jective. None of us were able. Per
haps it is true, as many information

Miss McClenny will also show

pianos made in America during the
18th century, and early theatres and
concert rooms.

After receiving a B. A. degree,
with honors, from Hollins College
with a major in piano, Miss Mc-
Clenny attended Columbia Univer-
sity Teachers College, from which
she was graduated with an M. A.
degree with a major in music. She
later attended Harvard summer
school for study in music history
and the International Summer Aca-
demy at the Mozarteum in Salz-
burg, Austria, where she was a
piano student of Heinz Scholz. She
was twice awarded a Danforth
Grant for study,

Timothy Wayne Wright, debating

last month in a car accident, has
withdrawn from the university for
the remainder of this semester on
advice from his doctors, according
to Dean of Students Lewis G. John.

Dean John, who received a letter
from Wright a few days ago, said
that Wright had missed four weeks
of school and recovery would neces-
sitate at least another two weeks.

Uclans To Take NCAA Title

the second half forced him out.
Now with torn ligaments in his
right knee, he will sit out what was
to be the most important game of
his collegiate career.

But back to the game. The differ-
ence in defense seems to be that St.
Bonaventure plays it. Jacksonville’s
strategy is simple. When somebody
yells “helter-skelter” four beheaded
chickens run aimlessly around while
Gilmore waits to block shots and
get rebounds. The game will be
sloppy, but Jacksonville’s height will
prevail in the second half with the
Dolphins breaking the game wide
open. St. Bonaventure’s best won't

be good enough here. Jacksonville
by twenty.

So it'll be a UCLA-Jacksonville
finale. And from the guy who gave
you the Orioles over the Mets, the
Vikings over the Chiefs, here’s an-
other! John Wooden's California
boys will handily defeat Jackson-
ville on Saturday. The Dolphins will
give ’em a run for a while but the
Uclans will eventually climb up and
over Jacksonville’s seven foot cy-
clone fence of Gilmore and Bur-
rows.

And then there were four... .
four championships in a row for
Coach John Wooden's UCLA
teams.
