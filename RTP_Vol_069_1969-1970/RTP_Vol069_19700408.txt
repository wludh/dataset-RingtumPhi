Volume LXIX

Dugan May Run
For Ga. Office

UNDER AGE LIMIT

W &L Sophomore Seeking
Lieutenant-Governorship

John Steven Dugan, a sophomore
at Washington and Lee, is consider-
ing running for the office of Lieu-
tenant-Governor of Georgia in the
upcoming November elections.

Dugan attended the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago in
1968 as a delegate from Georgia.
He said that “people in Georgia,
both liberal and conservative,” have
asked him to run for the office.

At present Dugan is still uncer-
tain about his plans. He is con-
sidering attending a press confer-
ence in Atlanta on Saturday morn-
ing, April 18, at which time he
could formally announce his deci-
sion.

The object of entering the race,
according to Dugan, would be to
establish a platform and to indicate
the intentions of a hopefully large

portion of the electorate. Dugan
also said that “most national at-
tention given to young people

today is focused on those radicals
aimed at destruction.” He felt that
his entering the race “would show
the responsibility of most young
people.”

In Georgia a person must be 25
years of age before he can qualify
for the office of Lieutenant-Gover-
nor. Dugan will be 20 on May 19.
He felt that if he were to get a good
portion of the votes cast, that law-
yers could overrule the age require-
ment. The law, he said, might be
declared unconstitutional on the
grounds that the rights of the elec-
torate are being infringed upon if
any candidate is denied the right to
run. The voting age in Georgia is 18.

Dugan presently is still uncertain.
Lester Maddox, present Governor
of Georgia, has already announced
his plans to run for Lieutenant-
Governor. Dugan felt that people
would vote for him as a protest to
Maddox. Under Georgia law, Mad-
dox is ineligible to run for re-elec-
tion as Governor.

Spring Weekend Plans Taking Shape
With Richie Havens Headlining Concert

Richie Havens will be the main
attraction of W&L’s Springs Week-
end, April 17-18. Entertainment for
the other night of the weekend has
not been signed as yet.

Richie Havens is probably one of
the most popular entertainers
around, His success has been won
primarily on the concert tour, al-
though his albums have often been
hits. His latest LP, “Stone Henge,”
has been on the Billboard Magazine
list of top LP’s for the last twelve
weeks. In addition to “Stone Henge”,
Havens has recorded “Somethin
Else Again” and “Richard P. Ha-
vens, 1983.”

Havens’
draws his

magnetic —_ personality
audiences close to him.
His quiet disarming approach to
each song makes him seem to be
confiding in his listeners who begin
to feel a part of the show, Indeed,
Havens incorporates the audience
into many of his songs like “A
Litthe Help From My Friends” in
which the audience actually be
comes the “Friends” and does all
the singing while Havens hums
along.

But aside from all the fun of a
Richie Havens concert, there's also a

Symposium Features
Labro’s New Movie

An _ unlikely candidate for de-
signation as an international cinema
capital, this city of 7,900 persons in
the Valley of Virginia is nonetheless
gaining close association with for-
eign films, and French ones in par-
ticular.

Last March and April, French
film-maker Philippe Labro shot some
sequences for his “Tout Peut Arriv-

” (“Anything Can Happen”) in the
Lexington area.

This month, Labro’s movie, not
yet released in the United States,
will be screened in Lexington as part
of a wide-ranging Symposium on
the Contemporary Motion Picture,
sponsored by Washington and Lee
University.

The symposium, to be held under
auspices of the Arthur and Margaret
Glasgow Foundation for the promo-
tion of the art of expression, will be
held in two segments—April 13-14
and April 20-21. Students from area
colleges, young film makers or other
persons seriously interested in the
film medium are welcome to attend,
according to O. W. Riegel, sym-
posium coordinator.

French theatrical films will be the
subject of four sessions of the first

segment of the symposium. Two
French film directors—Labro, and
Alain Jessua—will come to Lexing-
ton to discuss their films after
screenings. Labro’s “Tout Peut Ar-
river” will be screened at 7:30 p.m.
Monday, April 13, in the State
Theatre. Jessua’s film, “Jeu de Mass-
acre” (“The Killing Game”) will be
screened at 3 p.m. Tuesday, April
14, at the State Theatre.

Labro, an _ outstanding French
journalist who currently is a special
writer for France Soir of Paris,
came to the United States first at the
age of 18 to attend Washington and
Lee University where he studied
journalism and communications.

He returned to Lexington last
spring and filmed sequences for
“Tout Peut Arriver” at Rockbridge
Memorial Gardens, Radio Station
WREL, and the Lee Hi Truck Stop.
The rest of the film was shot in
France.

Bit parts in the film are played
by Pamela Powers, a 1969 graduate
of Hollins College: Clinton B. Pal-
mer, Ill, a W&L senior this year;
Martin Mullin, a 1969 graduate of
WAL; and Paxton Davis and O. W.
Riegel of the faculty of W&L’s De-
partment of Journalism and Com-
munications.

Washington and Lee students who
worked with the production crew
were Mullin, Charles R. Chittum,
and Clinton W. Murchison, all 1969
graduates, and Palmer and Glenn L.
Strohm, current seniors.

The Labro film is the story of a
man to whom anything can (and
does) happen in a short span of time
—tenderness and violence, love and
its absence, tragedy and comedy.
hirty-year-old Philippe Marlot likes
to define himself as a “salaried
tramp"—-a trained newspaperman
who wanders around the world to
observe his contemporaries and
write about them.

Student Elections

A most unfortunate situation developed last spring when
two seats on the Executive Committee were captured by their
only applicants. Certainly more than two students were quali-
fied for the positions of secretary and vice-president of the
student body.

We do not wish to demean the respective performances
of Mr. Chuck Dobbins and Mr. Joe Tompkins on this year’s
Executive Committee. Mr. Dobbins has done a superb job
as far as we can tell. However, the Executive Committee is
constitutionally both a legislative and a judicial body, and we
can only observe the EC in its legislative capacity.

The juridical aspect of the Executive Committee is by
far more important in respect to the individual student. The
EC has the constitutional authority to convict a student of an
honor violation and to ask him to leave school. It is pernicious
to the health of our academic community for a student to be
elected to this court of last resort without any opposition,

A student elected to the Executive Committee unopposed
is committed to no set platform concerning the legislative
function of that body. If such a student is an underclassman
(naturally anticipating re-election), he can abstain, as for
example Mr. Tompkins has, on several issues when he
should, in fact, be committed.

Petitions for candidacies for next year are due Monday.
We encourage any students who are at all concerned with fair
representation and the future of Washington and Lee to sub-
mit petitions for the EC positions.

We would also like to call the attention of the student
body to the fact that the former Big Four election has been
expanded this year to seven positions. In addition to the three
EC posts—President, Vice-President, and Secretary——and the
Fancy Dress presidency, the job of Dance Board vice-presi-
dent is now open to school-wide selection. The President and
Vice-President of the IFC will be chosen the same day with
suffrage and application for these two offices restricted to
fraternity men.

Staff Editorial

Earth Day, April 22

Environmental Concern at Washington and Lee has serv-
ed in recent months to arouse considerable interest in a com-
munity where apathy is all too often the rule.

From its inception several months ago, Environmental
Concern as a large group of interested individuals has emerg-
ed as a viable, dynamic, well structured organization that has
planned a symposium to be held in conjunction with Earth
Day, April 22.

The symposium even as it now stands is quite impressive
in both its scope and the quality of speakers it is offering;
particularly in light of similar activity planned on college
campuses throughout the country on the same day.

Such constructive and positive endeavors, at a time when
the mode of much campus activity is tending toward aliena-
tion and destructiveness, we find extremely refreshing and
we earnestly support.

April 22 is a day on which we may find excellent oppor-
tunity to educate ourselves further and to examine a very real
and perplexing problem confronting our society; one that
poses a very real threat to our very existence.

The initiative and drive sustaining and expanding this
active program has thus far come primarily from students.
However, faculty support and consideration are paramount.

To those ends we would urge the faculty to weigh the
merits of this undertaking, the serious and academic nature
in which its planners approached the program, and consider
foregoing or re-arranging classes to allow the Washington
and Lee community maximum participation.

A Simple Task

Gov. Holton’s campaign to clean up Virginia is being
given special attention by Lexington Monday in honor of his
visit here on Tuesday to speak for the Omicron Delta Kappa
Tap Day ceremony.

The city government has asked the W&L community to
participate in its efforts to beautify Lexington, and specific
notice has been called to the mess that surrounds most of the
fraternity houses around town,

The subject, it is true, is not monumental, and it is as
trite as school spirit. Nonetheless, the appearance of the fra-
ternity houses does reflect unfavorably on both the members
of those fraternities and on the university community in gen-
eral.

And if the subject is not monumental, neither is the ef-
fort required to correct the situation. Surely co-operation with
the town on so fundamental a level is possible, and we hope,
forthcoming.

For those people not in fraternities, the city is organizing
a volunteer clean-up campaign for Main Street beginning at
8:30 Monday morning and continuing through the day.

The whole effort is more practical than noble, but that is
not a reason to forego participation.

Local Pollution: Saving the Maury

By Bill Radigan and Chip Harris

To most inhabitants of Rock-
bridge County and the immediate
area, pollution has never been con-
sidered a relevant problem locally.
While not as evident as elsewhere,
pollution has nonetheless made in-
roads into the community.

The Commonwealth of Virginia
has created two pollution control
boards—for air and water—to estab-
lish pollution levels, to study areas
throughout the state to determine
organizations violating those levels,
and to prosecute those violators if
necessary.

The inception of the Air Control
Board only a few years ago has al-
lowed it only to go as far as meas-
uring community air pollution levels.
The Water Control Board, owing to
a longer existence, has been able to
determine not only the locations of
various levels of water contamina-
tion as area rivers move down-
stream, but also the specific sources
of pollution.

In most cases locally, towns and
industries have cooperated with the
board in attempting to alleviate the
problems they themselves are creat-
ing. Waterways continue to be pol-
luted, however. There is considerable
work to be done if standards are to
be complied with by July 1972, the
month and year that the state will
begin prosecuting any violators.

The Maury River is most directly
affected in the county by water pol-
lution, running past most major in-
dustries and through all major
towns. Donald Prager. Assistant Di-
rector of the Water Control Board,
commented: “The Maury is not a
productive river. Due to its soft
water, it won't support a large fish
population, and never will be a
fisherman's paradise. It is not by
any means up to its potential, how-
ever, and we have a fair way to go
until it is.”

Above the town of Goshen there
is no artificial discharge into the

Maury. However, following — the
Maury through Goshen until it fin-
ally empties into the James River,
man affects and contributes to the
river's contents in many ways.
Within the boudaries of Goshen
where the Maury is still the Calf
Pasture River, the river is industri-
ally employed by several firms.
Stillwater Worsted discharges over
500,000 gallons of treated water a

coloration of the river.

day at a point in the river where the
low flow is just 1.6 million gallons
a day. The chemically laden water
is allowed to stand in an anaerobic
lagoon. According to Prager, the
present method of treatment is un-
satisfactory, and the $00,000 gal-
lons entering daily need further at-
tention,

Further down the river is Ap-
palachian Wood Preservers creosode

Latex and dye discharge, although not harmful to life, will cause dis-

plant. Several years ago, their set-
tling basin was completely washed
out during a heavy rain, killing all
fish for a large area downstream. A
new system was designed and con-
structed, and is presently effective.

The Locher Silica Plant’s waste is
mainly sand and silt, and is put
through a settling pond. The effic-
iency is “questionable,” according to
Prager. Until last year a great deal

 

of silt was being discharged into the
river, causing much discoloration.
While the situation has improved,
Locher has presently engaged an en-
gineer to study the methods to deter-
mine a completely effective means of
eliminating the problem.

While Lexington is devoid of any
industry compounding the problem
of pollution on the Maury, the city
iself currently employs an ineffec-

 

Air pollution, not yet controlied by state regulations, remuins a problem for the Lesington area,

tive means of sewage disposal. Un-
like Goshen, which has no sewage
system, both Lexington and Buena
Vista possess primary treatment
plants. According to Prager this is
little more than “slowing the flow
of discharge long enough to allow
solids to settle.”

This treatment successfully re-
moves about 35 percent of BOD.
Roughly translated, BOD is organic
waste. Lexington is currently study-
ing the possibility of a secondary
treatment plant which they will have
to have within two years. Secondary
treatment removes about 85 percent
of BOD.

Bonded Fibers Corporation in
Buena Vista allows its heaviest latex
waste to settle out in a holding pond
before discharging into the river.
However, the rest of the waste is
dumped into the river. Two years
ago, when tested, the bottom of the
river downstream was almost liter-
ally a sheet of rubber. There is also
a problem of an occasional release
of dyes into the river, tinting the
water red or blue.

Bonded Fibers has ceased dump-
ing solid waste on the bank of the
river. They are still discharging 340
gallons a minute into the river al a
location where the river runs at a
rate of about 21,000 gallons low
flow. They are presently designing
facilities to alleviate the problem
further.

Reeves Brothers is currently
dunyping runoff that contains about
2 percent salt into the river. Two
hundred and fifty parts of salt to
1,000,000 parts of water is consider-
ed suitable for drinking.

Modine Manufacturing Company
is discharging waste into the Maury
from a bath preaspred to clean
metals. At the moment the only
damaging element is zinc. They are
presently designing a system to eli-
minate the zinc from the waste dis
charge.

The city of Buena Vista has a
situation completely parallel to that
of Lexington with their sewage dis-
posal. Their primary treatment plant
is also being studied to allow for the
addition of a secondary system.

James Lee and Son is responsible
for the largest load being dumped
into the river of the industries men
tioned, according to Prager, although
no exact figures are available. Several
years ago a dye containing insecti
cide was released into the fiver, re-
sulting in the death of much of the
fish population. Lee is also con
sidering treatment for its discharge.
which presently is receiving only
primary treaiment

Until two vears ago, the Water
Control Board had a staff of 3°
people for the entire state. The staff
has since been more than doubled
and the board's budget increased
considrably. A regional office has
also been opened in Lynchburg to

" Re: Books...

On People Pollution

By Betty Munger
Manager, W&L Bookstore

In his Founders’ Day speech on
January 19, 1970 Dr. Norman
Graebner suggested that the basic
idea of survival should be consid-
ered as the present-day organizing
principle of education,

He proposed, for the 1970's, “a
new concentration on those subjects
that matter for our continued exis-
tence.’ No one who even scans a
newspaper today can doubt that the
concern for our environment — this
planet — is the dominant theme for
an increasingly large number of
people. Articles, books, pamphlets
are pouring from the presses. Every-
day brings new advertisements for
new books and new approaches to
older themes.

It really all begins (and could
end!) with people. There is a peo-
ple pollution, we are told. Of course,
not you and me: but there are a lot
of people too many on this earth—
and there will be many too many
by the time present students begin
raising their families.

More than a hundred years ago
the Rev. Thomas R. Malthus, writ-
ing an article, originally for the
Supplement to the 1824 Encyclope-

dia Britannica, stated the case clear-
ly and ominously. In On Population,
a classic now, Malthus pointed out
that when the population growth ex-
ceeds the means of subsistence the
growth of the population is checked
by such miseries and vices as starva-
tion, disease, war, etc.

To this dread list we can now
add another: pollution. The human
animal is destroying its own habi-
tat. By sheer force of numbers, to
begin with. The documentation is
tremendous, detailing the increase in
the birth rate world-wide, and the
dangers that lie ahead in the next
20 years. The Population Bomb by
Ehrlich, Silent Explosion by Apple-
man, 99th Hour and The Prevalence
of People, to mention a few.

All other problems of the destruc-
tion of our air, earth and water de-
rive from these huge increases in
actual number of people. There are
hopeful persons—the World Popula-
tion/Planned Parenthood Associa-
tion and Population Growth Zezo
(spreading out from its start in Cali-
fornia) for instance—who believe
that this headlong self-suffocation
can be stopped.

It isn’t a matter of good works or
a worthy cause any more. It is the
necessity for survival.

A pril 22 Earth Day Set
For Study of Pollution

By Ronny Sklar

Washington and Lee University, in
connection with hundreds of other
colleges across the country, is par-
ticipating in Earth Day April 22.
The W&L Earth Day Committee, a
branch of the University Federation
of Concern, has planned an in depth
program to educate the student body
to all the aspects of environmental
planning and control.

The all day program in Lee Cha-
pel will center around three areas:
the present state of the eco-system
and its future if no present action
is taken, the action being taken to-
day by responsible industry and the
general state of the arts in pollution
control, and what else we must do
to insure the quality of our life in
this finite eco-system.

At 2 p.m. in Lee Chapel, Pro-
fessor Thomas Nye will speak on
“The General Nature of the Eco-
System,” an appraisal of the present
and portents of things to come.

Following Nye will be Dr. Rob-
ert F. Testine, chief of Reynolds
Metals’ environmental planning
who recently testified before Jenn-
ings Randolph's (D-W.Va.) Senate
Committee on pollution. Dr. Testine
will speak on solid waste, and will

THE RING-TUM PHI

From The J-School . . .

By Laurence M. Hilliard
Columnist

You will excuse me for not writ-
ing about one of the world’s great
problems, like Spiro Agnew, but
this week is special. Baseball is back!

Now, if you think I’m the type
who gets emotional every spring
when a new baseball season opens,
you’re absolutely right.

They tried to tell us last year that
major league baseball was 100 years
old, but it really isn’t. Actually, the
major leagues date back only to
1962. That’s the year the Mets were
born; with a few birth defects—
“Marvelous Marv” Throneberry,
Sherman “Roadblock” Jones, Elio
Chacon, Harry Chiti, et. al.

To be perfectly honest, the Mets
were not the best team in the world
those first few years. The East Side
Little League could beat them. The
only distinction the Mets had was
baseball’s only professional base-
runner, Rod Kanehl. Unfortunately,
very few Mets ever reached base,
so Kanehl’s “talents” were often
wasted, In one game, no Met reach-
ed base against Jim Bunning.

In 1962, the Amazins set a rec-
ord for futility by losing 120 games,
provoking a _ never-to-be-forgotten
comment from manager Casey Sten-
gel, which I couldn't understand
anyway.

But improvement was swift. The
next year, the Mets lost only I11
games. In seven years, they manag-
ed to drop 737 decisions, which
averages out to a mere 105 per
season.

But spurred on by other seeming-
ly impossible dreams — the Jets
beat the Colts, Richard Nixon won
an election, Jerry Rubin took a
shower — the Mets went all the way
in 69. The greatest accomplishment
since creation!

A Look At The Mets

New Breed — those insane Met
fans — I claim credit for contribut-
ing my share to the miracle. After
all, I did quit my job one week
early last summer and drove 500
miles to the Big City to join 58,000
other maniacs in rooting, scream-
ing, and pleading the Mets past the
Cubs. The Cubs came to NYC 2%
games ahead of the Mets. After suf-
fering through successive nights of
Koosman and Seaver, they left only
¥4 game ahead; and twenty-four
hours later they were in second
place to stay.

When the Mets had built up a
safe lead for Tom Seaver in the sec-
ond game, the fans started to sera-
nade Cub manager Leo Durocher
with “Good Bye Leo.” When the
game ended, the tune changed to
“Meet the Mets.”

After the Cubs fell, the Mets
looked for other victims. First the
Braves, then the Orioles faded be-
fore the mighty forces of Gil
Hodges. Three times within a month,
fans celebrated by tearing Shea Sta-
dium apart, while the Mets poured
champagne on everyone’ within
sight, including Mayor Lindsay.

This week it all begins again. I'll
start worrying about Spiro Agnew
again next October.

The Last Dynasty

By Tom Gage

The last cruel yet inevitable blow
has been struck and thus to be add-
ed to the growing list of nature’s ex-
tinct breeds is that rare bird, the
professional sports dynasty. The last
of its kind, the grandest behemoth
of them all, has fallen. In a rag-tag
defeat in their last game of the sea-
son, the Montreal Canadiens, dar-
lings of many more fans than just
those in La Belle Province, failed to
make the Stanley Cup playoffs for
the first time in 22 years,

If you're a hockey fan, it’s im-
possible to believe that big Jean Be
liveau, the Pocket-Rocket Henri
Richard et al won't have the chance
of skating their splendid way to vic-
tory again this year. But, you know,

nor could we believe that the Yan-
kees had left their toe hold on Mt.
Olympus and had plunged to the in-
fernal depths of fifth place in 1965.
Professional sports were still im-
bued with the dynasty tradition then,
however. After all, wasn’t there foot-
ball’s Green Bay, hockey’s Mont-
real, basketball’s Boston, and even
golf's Big Three. It was an era of
predictability, but not one conducive
to heroes. There was about one true
hero per dynasty, a Russell, a Hor-
nung, or a Palmer. One by one they
departed, though. The Yankees, the
Packers in "68, and the Celtics this
year. But it was the downfall of Les
Canadiens that put the icing on the
cake.

Yet we must decide if the new

Lacrosse Team 2-1
After Spring Recess

By Frank Brooks

The General’s lacrosse team after
a great win over Geneseo State,
dropped a heartbreaker to Towson
State Teachers College by a score of
11-7. Despite intense hustle and de-
termination, W&L couldn’t _ pull
ahead of a spirited opposition.

The game was close up until the
very end. Towson led off with two
quick goals and picked up one more
minutes later, but Chip Tompkins
and Sam Englehart tied the score
in the second quarter. By the end of
the half however Towson had taken
the lead again, 5 to 3,

In the third period the Generals
capitalized on a series of extra man
plays to tie 7-7 with what seemed
to be a limping Towson State. But
this spirited the Tigers into dominat-
ing the fourth period and finally
winning.

The saddest aspect of the game
was that W&L played one of its best
games in years,

What was most encouraging was
the teamwork. Six of the seven goals
were assisted; the clears for the most

 

 

era devoid of the dynasty as it sure-
ly is, is not really of more benefit to
the sports scene. Oh yes the Yan-
kees with their M-M boys were held
in respect as were the precision
Packers of the NFL, but as the years
rolled by and pennant followed end-
less pennant, the love and enthus-
iasm for these teams dwindled into
a relatively quiet reverance. The
very fall of these teams would gen-
erate more emotion and excitement
than still another championship.
The new challenge to be met by the
heir apparents in the various lea-
gues gave the writers more to write
about, the broadcasters more to talk
about, and most important of all it
gave the people, the paying specta-
tors more to cheer about.
Montreal had a good hockey team
this year, but the share-the-wealth
draft had strengthened other clubs
as do similar drafts in the three
other major sports. If professional
sports did not make these somewhat
equalizing allowances to the weaker
teams, the dynasties would very
probably still exist today and the in-
vigorating new blood of such teams

part worked smoothly; and most en-
couraging, extra man offense was
almost poetic.

The freshmen are most important

to this year’s team. Englehart,
Tompkins, and Brumback have been
making important contributions.

Coach Szlasa now has enough depth
to run three strong midfields and
keep both the attack and defense
fresh.

In the game, goals were scored
by Englehart (3), Tompkins (2),
Groton, and Neese. Neese had 2
assists and Whit Morrill had four.

Coming off the loss to Towson
State, the Generals swept past a
surprisingly powerful Villanova.
The game was a toss-up through the
third quarter. The fourth Quarter
however found the Generals shovel-
ing goals past the Villanova goalie.
When the smoke had cleared, W&L
had won 10-6.

WAL, obviously in control of the
game, took almost every face-off
and kept the ball in the attacking
end of the field nearly seventy-five
per cent of the game. Scoring how-
ever came with more difficulty
mostly because of a wet field.

Sam Englehart scored five times
and Tom Groton tallied another
four thanks to expert feeds by Scott
Neese and Bob Brumback who had
three each. Hank Slauson had one
goal and one assist while Whit Mor-
rill contributed an assist.

The Generals, now standing 2-1
this season, are looking forward to
the Duke game at Durham this Sat-
urday. Baltimore University will
visit Lexington Springs Weekend.

as the Mets, the Knicks, the Black
Hawks, the Bucks, the Jets, and
many others would be wasted on
one-sided competition.

The empire that brought the Ca-
nadiens the Stanley Cup nine times
in the last fourteen years has indeed
collapsed, and another of such ten-
ure shall never replace it. Montreal
still might come back and win it all
again next year however. The Yan-
kees once again have a contender.
and there are optimistic rumblings
up on that Wisconsin bay. But they'll
only be teams now, not dynasties.
The rare bird is dead.

Generals Limp Back From Florida

By Bob LaRue

Washington and Lee opened the
baseball season by sweeping a dou-
bleheader from Cleveland State but
suffered a disastrous Florida tour to
bring their current record to 3-4,

The Generals initiated the tour
with a 7-5 victory over Aurora Col-
lege, but dropped the second en-
counter 4-1. Harvard blasted the
Generals twice, 16-1 and 10-4, and
Florida Presbyterian College closed
the coffin with a five-inning 3-2 win
shortened by darkness.

W&L felled the Aurora nine by
unleashing a twelve-hit attack. Steve
Kalista, Ray Coates, Brad Hall, EI-
lie Gutshall, and Jack Baizley each
had two hits, and Kalista and John
Nolan drove in two runs apiece.
Freshman Bruce King, relieving Bill
Miller in the fourth inning, picked
up the victory. The Generals, down
3-2 after three, rallied for three runs
in the fourth and a pair of tallies in
the fifth. King fanned eight, walked
three, and allowed two runs on three
hits in his six innings of work.

But Aurora came back for a 4-1
decision on a two-hitter by Fred
Mueller. Scott McChrystal drove
in the Blue’s only run on a sacrifice
which scored Chris Coursen. Bill
French was touched for the loss in
his first start of the season.

Harvard crushed W&L twice be-

hind a thunderous offensive barrage.
The Crimson collected ten hits,
among them Doug Varney’s grand
slam homer in the third. The Gen-
erals could do no right, as Tom
Dashiell handcuffed the Blue on four
hits, three of which were banged out
by John Nolan. In addition, W&L
committed seven errors and a trio of
pitchers surrendered 15 walks. Start-
r Bill Miller was the losing hurler,
allowing six runs in two innings.
Tim Haley worked 1 1/3 innings,
giving up four runs. Don McMillan
gave up six runs, only one of which
was earned, in his 5 2/3 innings.

The Generals faired better in the
second game but still fell short, 10-
4. Mike Thomas’ three run pinch
homer off Bruce King in the sixth
put Harvard ahead for keeps, 6-4.
W&L scored twice in the first on
Scott McChrystal’s first of three
singles, and twice more in the sixth
on back-to-back singles by John
Nolan and Ray Coates.

King, the loser, pitched six inn-
ings, allowing six runs and six hits
while striking out two and walking
eight. Bill Creener yielded three
runs and three hits in two innings.
Harvard added a final tally in the

ninth off Tim Haley.

Florida Presbyterian edged W&L
in a five-inning contest, coming up
with three runs in the darkened final
inning. Bill Miller was handed his
second loss, allowing four of the
Tritons’ five hits, including Shawn
McElroy’s game-winning double, in
the murderous fifth inning. The
right-hander whiffed three and walk-
ed two.

The Generals jumped to a 2-0
lead early in the game, as FPC’s
Jim McIntyre walked five and allow-
ed Scott McChrystal’s run-scoring
single. But the Tritons brought on
Tom Ferber in relief, and the tall
right hander held the Blue to only
one single while striking out six.

The Generals had earlier welcom-
ed the season with 6-1 and 8-6 vic-
tories over Cleveland State. Bill
Miller fanned eleven Vikings while
walking two, and surrendered only
two hits to pick up the victory in the
first game. Home runs by Ellie Gut-
shall and John Nolan put the game
out of reach.

A five run tally, based on five hits
and four walks, lifted the Blue to
victory in the second game. Jack

Baizley, four for seven for the after-

noon, provided the key blow, a two-
run double to right field. Don Mc-
Millan was the winning pitcher in
relief.

After seven games, co-captains
John Nolan and Scott McChrystal
are team leaders in hits, batting
average, and runs batted in. Nolan,
with ten hits and five RBI’s, is cur-
rently hitting .417. McChrystal, with
nine base hits and four RBI’s, is not
far behind at .375. Others sporting
hefty batting averages are Ellie Gut-
shall (.318) and Bob LaRue (.357).

The Generals, almost halfway
through their season, have only play-
ed seven official games. The Long
Island University doubleheader and
a single game with Bucknell were
victims of rain. However, the Gen-
erals resumed action this week with
a single game Tuesday at Charlottes-
ville against U. Va. and a twin bill
with Old Dominion this Saturday in
Norfolk. The Blue nine have only
three scheduled home dates remain-
ing, entertaining Hampden-Sydney
April 16, Lynchburg April 24, and
Bridgewater May 4 for two games.
Under consideration are possible
home games with VMI and Holy
Cross, but nothing is definite so far.

 

There's something new in the way of tennis balls this season.

The W&L tennis team takes on
their second major college opponent
in a row when they go against the
Duke Blue Devils this afternoon on
the home courts, Coach Canfield and
his squad certainly hope that they'll
be able to dispose of this opponent
as early as they did their first, for
the Generals annihilated the Univer-
sity of Akron back on March 25. A
match with Bucknell was scheduled
for that same week but was rained
out, so the W&L team hasn't taken
to the courts against competition for
two weeks.

In all Coach Canfield’s squad will
be facing six major college oppon
ents this year but the challenge is
welcomed by the Coach, “We'll be
hard pressed to produce a winner,
but I think we'll do it. We've got a
good blend of freshmen and upper
classmen on this team. They've been
working hard and are more than
ready to go out after another con
ference title.”

Senior captain Tom MeJunkin
started working out the team with
calisthenics back in February and
formal practice started at the be
ginning of March. Due tothe
weather the team could not practice
on the WAL courts right away. “But

wormam sre $ Tennis Team to Face Rugged
Duke Blue Devils in 2nd Meet

our own courts have been improved
with a new sprinkler system,” said
Canfield, “and now if we can just
keep people with street-shoes off
them, we'll be in good shape court-
wise.”

Ihe line-up for the Duke match
will probably be as follows: Singles-
1. Bill Gatlin; 2. Stan Taylor; 3.
Marshall Washburn; 4. Jeff Driscoll;
5. Tom McJunkin; 6. Rick Arm-
strong. The doubles line-up: 1. Gat-
lin-Driscol; 2. Taylor-Cooksie; 3.
McJunkin-Armstrong.

‘Neer to Head Track Team

~ Overall, Washington and Lee Uni-
versity’s track prospects appear
about the same as last year. The
Generals have strengthened some
former weaknesses, but have tailed
off in some areas where they used
to be strongest.

“We will have more balance and
depth this year,” said W&L track
coach Syd Walden, “particularly in
the middle distance events. But we'll
be weaker in the weight events.”

The main strength and attraction
is co-captain Mike Neer, W&L’s
All-America high jumper. Neer cap-
ped off a fabulous spring last year
by placing fourth in the national
college division meet. The top four
finishers are designated All-Ameri-
cans,

En route

to the national meet,

Neer won both the Virginia State
and College Athletic Conference
chi i i i records in
both—won the Colonial Relays and

meets, and finished second in the

Elections, Housemothers, Rush

Highlight Monday IFC Meeting

Routine business was the chief
occupation of the Monday night
IFC meeting. The first item on the
agenda was a note from the Student
Affairs Committee, requesting an
alteration in the rush plan proposed
by the IFC. The SAC felt that Sun-
day night rush dates were not ac-
ceptable, and they requested mem-
bers from several of the houses that
voted for the proposal to appear be-
fore them to iron out this matter.

The SAC also turned down the
proposal from the IFC which stated
that housemothers were no longer
necessary and should not be requir-
ed. President Cahn said that there
was some indication that positive
action would be taken on this mat-
ier next year as the composition of
the committee will be changed,

President Cahn announced that
nominations for President and Vice
President of the IFC would be next
week. Elections for these officers

will be held at the same time as Stu-
dent Body Elections.

The IFC will begin taking applica-
tions for next year’s Contact Chair-
man. The chairman will be chosen
by a committee consisting of four
members from both the IFC and
EC,

The two Kenyans which the IFC
voted to accept as foreign students
for four years were found by the
school to be academically unaccept-
able. Professor Drake has begun to

look for another student to their
their place for next year.
Dean John announced that the

week of April 13 would be “Clean-
up Week” in Virginia. Tuesday,
April 14, has been designated as
“Clean-up Day” in Lexington, as
Governor Linwood Holton is com-
ing to Lexington to speak at the
ODK assembly. Fraternities are en-
couraged to participate in this ef-
fort by cleaning up around
houses. The University will have
trucks to come around to pick up
any trash that the fraternity houses
may have. There will also be a
general effort to clean up the down-
town area itself and all students are
encouraged to participate. A group
will meet at the Robert E. Lee
Hotel at 8:30 that morning.

Lawyers To Talk Tonight
On Pueblo, U-2 Crises

Iwo Virginia lawyers will be at
WAL tonight to tell the story of
their involvement in two of the
most dramatic events in the history
of the Cold War.

Hugh P. Cline and Carl EB. Me-
Afee, who practice law in Norton,
Va., a town of about 5,000 people
in rural Wise County, were instru-
mental in the defense of U-2 pilot
Francis Gary Powers and in the re-
lease of the crew of the captured
U.S. spy ship Pueblo, They will tell
of their experiences beginning at 8
p.m. in the Alumni House, under
the sponsorship of the Student Bar
Association Speakers Committee.

The involvement of the two law-
yers (one of whom, Cline, is a 1948
graduate of WAL Law School)
came about because Oliver Powers,
father of the downed pilot, kept a
shoe shop underneath their Norton
office, When Francis Powers was
put on trial by the Russians, his
father insisted on retaining McAfee
to represent him, despite offers of
aid from several better-known law-
yers and McAfee’s lack of experi
ence in international affairs

Group Plans Four-Day Program
To Help in Selection of Major

By Jim Mathews
Assimilation Committee

The Assimilation Committee has
announced plans for a Majors Week
to be held April 20-23 in the Uni-
versity Center, The format, a series
of student-faculty coffees, is design-
ed to give underclassmen the oppor-
tunity to talk with department heads
and student representatives about
the various majors available under
the new, as well as the old, Univer-
sity Catalogue.

The purpose of the series, as de-
signated by the Committee, is to al-
leviate the problem facing the W&L
undergraduate in trying to choose a
major: that many times he cannot
acquire enough general information
and insight into a_ specific major
from simply reading the catalogue
or talking with a faculty adviser.

The Committee hopes that the
Week will: (1) help freshmen decide

on survey and elective courses for
the following year; and (2) help all
underclassmen compare the _ pro-
grams for majoring in each of the
departments, thus allowing each stu-
dent to be better able to make a
proper choice.

The departments which — offer
majors and are included in the series
are: Ancient Languages, Biology,
Commerce, Economics, Engineering,
English, Fine Arts, Geology, Ger-
man, History, Journalism, Mathe-
matics, Philosophy, Physics, Politi-
cal Science, Psychology, Religion,
Romance Languages, and Sociology.
Chemistry will not be included for
it already has a similar program.

Next week's Ring-tum Phi will
publish the schedule for each of the
above, as well as discussion leaders
and student majors for each part of
the Series.

Freshman Dean’s List Changed;
Faculty Reviews SAC Activities

The faculty lowered the grade
point requirement for freshmen for
placement on the Dean’s List at its
regular meeting on Monday night.
Where freshmen now must have a
3.5 average for the semester to be
placed on the Dean’s List, starting
next year a grade point ratio of 3.0
will be needed. This action was
taken because under the new system
of having professors determine the
rules for attendance for their own

will not have unlimited cuts. Prev-
iously, any freshman on the Dean’s
List was granted unlimited cuts,

The faculty also elected Professor
Andrew W. McThenia of the Law
School and Professor Robert W.
McAhren of the History Depart-
ment to the Faculty Executive Com-
mittee. They will serve terms of two
years,

A report on the activities of the
Student Activities Committee was
submitted to the faculty. The report
was primarily concerned with the
question of revised parietal regula-
tions for the Law School dormi-
tories and the IFC’s motion to
abolish the requirement for the fra-
ternity houses to have housemothers
in residence.

The SAC in a meeting this after-
noon discussed deferred rush and
freshmen orientation. Three rep-
resentatives of the IFC were present
for the discussion on deferred rush.

NOTICE

Applications for next year’s CON-
TACT chairman are due a week
from today. They should be mailed
or given personally to Chuck Cahn,
IFC president and should include
ideas and an estimated budget. The
program is sponsored by the IFC,
but non-fraternity men are also elig-
ible to be chairman. Selection will
be made by four members of the
IFC Judicial Board and four mem-
bers of the student body Executive
Committee.
