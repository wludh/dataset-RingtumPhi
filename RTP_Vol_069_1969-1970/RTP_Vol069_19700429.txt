On the front page, a news analy-
sis of important stories will appear
when events are deemed worthy of
a news anaylsis. The column will
appear under the title of “Pin Point”
and will appear in the newspaper
irregularly.

“To promote a more fluent ex-
change of opinion within the Uni-
versity,” McConnell said, an opinion

The Ring-tum Phi has learned
that Kappa Alpha Order's national
office rescinded the charter of its
Alpha chapter at W&L. The deci

Lawrence Sworn In President;

EC Allows Ann Red On Ballot

The EC swore in new student
body officers, heard requests from
students representing two areas, and
dealt with the eligibility of a con-
troversial candidate during Monday
night’s meeting,

Secretary Dobbins opened _ the
meeting by announcing the results
of last week’s student body elections
as well as the list of candidates for
next week’s class contests.

Fran Lawrence, a philosophy ma-
jor from Alexandria, captured the
student body presidency with 493
votes to 472 for Joe Tompkins. Rich
Murray, a journalism major from
Valatie, New York, won over Bruce
Madison for secretary, 463 to 398,
Phil Thompson, a law student from
Short Hills, New Jersey was elected
in an unopposed race for the vice-
presidency.

The other winners were Doug
Gossman, who won over Andrew
Wyndham for IFC President, Bob
Larue, who defeated Rob Minor for
the IFC vice-presidency, and Bert
Meem who downed JoJo Martin for
vice-president of the Dance Board.

The validity of the petition of
Miss Ann Red for the Presidency
of next year’s sophomore class con-
stituted the first discussion on the
agenda. Miss Red, currently a fresh-
man at Randolph-Macon Women’s
College, will be a part of the stu-
dent exchange program at W&L
next year.

After several readings from the
Student Body Constitution, and the
continued stress that the evening's

vote would “set a precedent for
future years,” Bethea moved that
the petition be accepted.

The motion was carried six to
five. Azuma, Bethea, Dobbins,
Markham, Ogilvie, and Tompkins
supported the proposal. Dean Kum-
puris, Drew Kumpuris, Andrews,
Prater and Thompson were in op-
position.

See Editorial Comment, page 2;
And Feature Story, page 3

Dan Silberberg, Interim Co-
Chairman of the 1972 Mock Con-
vention, reported to the committee
and requested funds for postage,
stationery and printing costs. After
a lengthy examination of the uses
of the money, Dean Kumpuris
moved that the Convention be al-
lotted one hundred dollars. This
passed unanimously.

Tom Mays and Steve Garris,
along with freshman representative
Alan Prater, presented for “recom
mendations and criticisms,” a pro-
posal for a “University Club” to
generate “cultural, social, academic
and religious interest within the
University faculty, students and
alumni.

Prater moved that the organiza
tion, which seeks to use the student
union as well as other parts of
the campus, be called to the at-
tention of the student body. Dean
Kumpuris moved that the proposal
be tabled pending more information:

e 2 THE RING-TUM PHI

E

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion of The Ring-tum Phi

Wednesday, April 29, 1970

From A New Writer To A Sometimes Reader

One of the most alluring temptations for
any human institution is for it to consider it-
self as the Ptolemaic center of a social uni-
verse. And this temptation has always been
doubly attractive for the Ring-tum Phi, for
its editor and staff have the somewhat titanic
responsibility of accumulating all the weekly
news and opinion of Washington and Lee
and arranging its content on six sheets of
newsprint 14 inches wide and 20 inches
long.

Consequently, we can be easily lulled
into the unjustifiable prejudice that the Ring-
tum Phi is the most important student in-
stitution on the campus. The most apparent
danger in this narrow attitude is that the
very publication of the newspaper tends to
become an end unto itself, thus promoting
a condescending attitude towards the rest of
the university community: it is all too easy
to flail the straw horse of apathy when a
newspaper is not read by its audience.

We would like to hope that the news-
paper has not operated under this self-asser-
tive fallacy in the past; in the future we will
attempt to avoid its pitfalls by striving to
reach several goals, the paramount purpose
being service to students, faculty, administra-

tion, alumni, and parents.

According to a faculty member in the
journalism department, national newspapers
have been greatly affected in recent years by
mergers—the resultant effect being a de-
crease in the forums for the expression of
opinion. The Ring-tum Phi is not unlike na-
tional newspapers in this sense; for, with the
combination of two four page editions into
one six page edition, the burdensome chal-
lenge of providing news and a forum for
opinion for the Washington and Lee com-
munity becomes even more demanding.

With this challenge for the coming year
in mind, we pledge service to the university
community by striving to provide an accur-
ate, reliable mirror of all the news relevant to
the community, and a forum for the ex-
change of divergent viewpoints on university
or extra-university issues.

At the risk of a platitudinous statement,
“to promise” and “to perform” historically
tend to be paradoxical infinitives. Realizing
this, we ask of you, the reader, to contribute
your opinions, advice, and criticism. For if
we are to judge how well we communicate to
you, you must respond to our effort.

—L. L. Me.

Ask Not For Whom The Bell Tolls...

Within a year’s time, the death knell has
sounded for two fraternities on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus. Life in 16 other frater-
nity houses goes on as normal; maybe oc-
casional comments are made that there will
just be two less fraternities to compete against
during next year’s deferred rush. The front
campus looks the same as it did last spring
when those two fraternity houses were still
occupied with people; perhaps those who sit
behind cluttered desks muse it was a sign
of our changing times that two fraternities
have decided to fold.

Within a year’s time, two death knells
have sounded for fraternities on the Wash-
ington and Lee campus. And, if we may have
the momentary license to prognosticate the
future, the resonances begun this year will
be heard again the next.

Fraternities have committed a tragic er-
ror in the past for which they are presently
paying with their lives: they have failed to
recognize that their only hope of salvation
was in the potential for the Interfraternity
Council to be a collective body representing
the best interests of the fraternity system, not
power block ABC and XYZ.

The IFC is the only institution on this
campus which will actively promote the idea
“fraternity; and those who dream that the
faculty or administration are actively sup-
porting fraternities are living in the bygone

age of in loco parentis. Now, it’s laissez faire

Pied Piperism

To those who might argue that W&L
is provincial and backward because it respects
tradition and custom, we can only say open
your eyes. The most recent indication that
we are keeping in step—unfortunate as that
may be—with the rest of the nation appeared
Monday night when the Executive Com-
mittee allowed Miss Red to run for the
office of sophomore president.

By keeping in step we do not mean with
the trend promoting the ideal of the “emancei-
pated woman,” rather we are more con-
cerned with the EC blindly following the
currently popular Pied Piper down the road
of loose constructionism just for the sake of
being part of the mindless mob. If the EC
had moved from a strict interpretation of the
student body constitution for any considered
reason, that would have been fine. Their
ruling on the Miss Red case, however, can
be regarded only as that—misread.

Historically, enabling documents such as
the student body constitution are written to
permit a certain amount of interpretive
analysis which insures flexibility and hence
permanence. Precedent on this campus has
granted the EC sole responsibility in the
juridical role of interpreting this document.
The EC should, however, be made to com-

education, which means of course that if
students want fraternities, they can have
them, just so long as their institutions do not
interfere with the academic environment of
the university. The dubious attempt to place
fraternities in a proper academic perspective
was made by the faculty—they shouldered a
majority of the student body with the awe-
some responsibility of obtaining a substantial
new membership during the first seven weeks
of classes.

But after all is said about who made next
year’s bed, the fraternities still must lie in
it. Next year’s deferred rush serves only to
place an even greater responsibility upon a
governing body which has in the past been
neither governing nor a body.

And if fraternities are to survive the perils
of freshman cars, academic pressure, and
seven weeks of work, they must look first to
the Interfraternity Council and the leader-
ship of its new president, Doug Gossman.
We do not envy his task for the coming year:
the active promotion of the fraternity con-
cept as a workable, valuable aspect of the
Washington and Lee educational environ-
ment.

Unless sectionalism and politics are cast
aside, the fraternity system’s narrowness of
the past will become its pallbearer for the
future.

—L. L. Me.

And The E C

prehend the distinction between interpreta-
tion and emendation.
The justification of Miss Red’s candi-
requires constitutional emendation, not
interpretation. In other words, the action
usurped the prerogative of the student body
which, as the EC is fully aware, must approve
constitutional amendments.

The constitution requires candidates for
the three EC posts elected at-large to be
“regularly matriculated”. There is no explicit
provision regarding such a requirement for
the other student body offices. The only
rational interpretation that could possibly
be made would be naturally to stipulate
that all candidates be “regularly matricu-
lated”, since that clause appears in the con-
stitution,

The Executive Committee circumvented
the constitution in permitting Miss Red’s
candidacy, since it understood that she will
not be a W&L student until September,
wheras the duties of that office are assumed
at commencement. To apply this new mean-
ing to the constitution, the EC, if it had
any semblance of legal or moral ethics,
would have to gain the approval of the
entire student body—and it did not.

—R.H.Y.

A New Curriculum: The Future
For W&L Academics In The 70’s

By DAVE OLSON

Unlike previous years with the
coming of spring now the student
body has been awaiting with antici-
pation the coming of the new cata-
logue with its great body of in-
formation on how things will be
under the new curriculum beginning
next year.

Although the official catalogue
will not be out till the fall, a book-
let with course offerings and de-
gree requirements has been put out.

Not only is the new collection of
courses offered more voluminous
but also far more varied. Many
departments have worked in con-
junction to form interdepartmental
majors and courses. The most in-
teresting of these is the Biology-
Psychology-Sociology major which
is offered as an education in the
human condition. There are also
combinations in the fields of Mathe-
matics and Physics and there will
be a great deal of leeway given to
science majors to major interde-
partmentally.

There have also been some new
departments created. The Classics,
which will study the Greek and
Latin classics and our English herit-
age from these classical languages.
Music and Drama has now been
taken out from under the Art de-
partment and has been made a
department in its own right. For
the first time an introductory course
in Italian will be offered. Basically
the rest of the departments have
remained the same as far as ad-
ministrative constitution is con-
cerned.

In the departments themselves,
however, there have been many
varied and exciting changes. With the
advent of the spring term there
have been created greater seminar
possibilities in all departments.

I will try to mention some of the
more notable changes. In History
there has been a large expansion in
the number of courses offered. A
new member of the History faculty,
Professor Porter, will be teaching
six new courses (some in African
History) and the other professors
in the department have added
courses as well. There are also
offered seminar courses for fresh-
men and sophomores in either
United States or European History,
an opportunity not open to under-
classmen in the past. As a matter
of fact, this is the case in many
of the departments.

In geology there is an interest-
ing array of one-credit courses on
subjects of contemporary interest,

*. . . hopefully
we can achieve
some of that neb-
ulous quality called
intellectual

curiosity.”

most notably a course on Urban
Development and Regional Planning
and a course on the Moon. The
Physics is now offering Astronomy
without the necessity of a prere-
quisite.

In Sociology a course on Black
America is being offered for the
academic year 1971-1972, a course
long overdue at Washington and
Lee. In English there is a variety
of course offerings for freshmen
and sophomores instead of the drab
freshman course, the History of
British Literature offered in the
past. Not only has the English De-
partment added more courses for
freshmen and sophmores but most
of the departments with heavy loads
in this area have done likewise.

In most cases the departments
have designed courses on a two-fold
basis, one for the student planning
to major in that field or that stu-
dent who is taking the course for
distribution requirements. Sciences
especially have designed courses
with the arts student in mind.

Distribution is as it was ex-
plained last spring, that is, 36 hours
from 4 divisions with between 6
and 12 hours for each of the
divisions. The divisions are gener-
ally: Languages, the Arts, Math and
Science and the Social sciences.

Credit hours for graduation have
been instituted on a sliding scale
whereby the Class of ‘71 will need
120 hours to graduate, the Class of
72 will need 118 and the Class of
73 will need 117 and all subsequent
classes will need 115 hours to gradu-
ate. The Pass/Fail course option
has been extended to the Sophomore

class as the Junior and Senior
classes as in the past. Also we will
have to deal with wolf-in-sheep’s-
clothing in the professor's decid-
ing cut restrictions.

I would like to say a word about
two instructors. Mr. Pellicciaro, pre-
viously teaching in Ancient langu-
ages will now also be teaching
courses in Art, Classics, Sociology
and Philosophy (in conjunction with
Professor Pemberton). He must be
a very versatile and ambitious
teacher. Also Washington and Lee
will have a female on the faculty
next year. She will be Mrs. O. K.
Barnes and she will be taking over
for Lee Kahn while he is on leave
next year.

Although it may seem that things
will be much easier and enjoyable
next year we should approach the
year with caution. There will be
many classes meeting for an hour
and forty minutes length. Also we
will have classes from eight in the
morning to five in the afternoon.
We have to keep in mind the fact
that was in the past covered in
fifteen weeks will now be covered
in twlve weeks so the concentration
and amount of work is sure to be
increased.

I feel that the changes will be
good for Washington and Lee. It
will be new, different and exciting:
and hopefully we can now achieve
some of that nebulous quality call-
ed intellectual curiosity.

Procedure Cited

For Registration

When Spring Registration time
comes this year certain changes will
be noted, changes both in the forms
to be used and in the procedures,

Considering the purpose of the
Registration Form and how it could
be used most effectively, it was de-
cided to use a different computer
card for each term. The cards are
identical except for the designation
of term, FALL, WINTER AND
SPRING. As far as the students and
professors are concerned, the proce-
dure for registration is the same, but
because the form is on a card, it can
be better handled by the computer
personnel, with the student properly
identified etc. The card seems to be a
proper compromise between doing
everything by hand or everything by
machine.

A PLANNING CARD is being

College Guide Rates W&L

By BOR VEVICH
Editor-in-Chief

Washington and Lee has a library
replete with 200,000 volumes .
how many students here frequent
the library? Our average SAT
scores are 600 verbal, 630 math

. are our students interesting of
boorish, urbane or provincial?

Questions such as these are com-
monly posed by prospective stu-
dents here and at every other col-
lege and university. Without visiting
a campus for a week, however,
there is a strong possibility that po-
tential college freshmen will never
learn the answers. A recently pub-
lished guide attmpts to offer some
answers by picturing what life at
100 or so colleges and universities
is really like.

Compiled and edited by the staff
of The Yale Daily News, “The
Insiders’ Guide to the Colleges”
should become one of the most suc-
cessful works of the decade. Writ-
ten in charming and easygoing style,
this novel guide makes a significant
start in filling the void left by pro-
fessional works which are too sta-

tistical and never really get at the
heart of a school.

The insiders’ guide is just that,
It was compiled from reports of
student correspondents at each of
the colleges, and who would be
better able to offer more candid and
factual reports about student life?
The University of Georgia section,
for example, reads: “There is also
a running rumor tht Jesus Christ
could never have been born at
Georgia, since this would require
three wise men and a virgin.”

The truthful bluntness of the
guide is sometimes frightening: “In
selecting a college one must always
remember that ‘the college experi-
ence’ per se has only a coincidental
relation to education. College,
really, is a moratorium, a time for
you to stick your toe in the
Olympic-size swimming pool of life
before taking that final shivering
plunge. Whether you get an educa-
tion ~ or not (it's a $0-50 chance),
you will be a different person four
years from entering.”

“The fact is that even at the

On Racial Incident

To the Editor, Ring-ium Phi

I am writing this letter in order
to make Washington and Lee stu-
dents aware of certain events which
took place last Thursday evening,
April 23, at the Dahlia on Bedford
Avenue, in Lynchburg Virginia

That evening my date and I,
along with two other couples, were
firmly refused any kind of service
by the bartender, We were not even
served Cokes, This quick. and quite
clear, denial of service had cer
tainly not been prompted by our
actions or general behavior—we had
not been drinking, we had entered
the establishment in an orderly fash-

ion, and we had been polite to the
bartender

After a few inquiries as to why
we were being refused service it
became quite apparent that the
reason was that one of the couples
in our group was inter-racial,

We were shortly asked to leave
by the bartender, that “he didn't
need our kind around here.” Upon
leaving we were “escorted” out by
by the bartender and seven local
patrons of the Dahlia.

I am concerned for the embarass
ment cause to the couple. Also, |
can now more clearly sympathize
with militant blacks. I hope this
incident will be recalled by any
students who might consider pa-
tronizing the Dahlia in the future

best colleges classes and books are
often an annoying detail in the
life of the student. Most important
college experiences take place in the
bars, poo! halls, fraternities, clubs,
football stadiums, sororities .
during summer vacations . . . after
eleven o'clock at night.” In short,
the work shatters illusions that
should be shattered in the hope of
helping students to find the right
place for their personality so that
wrong decisions, such as those based
on the “I came here because the
economics department was good”
attitudes, can be avoided.

The book offers some comments
which are valuable in soul-searching
for students already in college. For
examble, the editors identify five
basic genres in collegiate types: the
hippie-syndrome protester; the soc-
ial-athlete-stud who is never seen
in the same place as the first type
and whose hair is neatly combed:
the all-American civic student leader
who wants to go to law school: the
wonk; and, the nerdish tube rat.

The last two two type comprise
over fifty percent of the usual
student body but are most difficul
to spot since they rarely come out
in the open, The wonk spends all
his time in the library, is disdainful
of most things, and never tells dirty
jokes. The tube rat makes C's, sel-
dom dates, watches Mission Impos-
sible or Mod Squad, and reads
Playboy from cover to cover

The WAL section accurately in
forms the reader what there is to
do at “St. Bob's” college in a
well-written comprehensive essay
which for some reason is probably
the dullest passage in the book
Most of it unfortunately reads like
the propaganda found in the cata
logue with a few exceptions. “The
girls are imported by car {not
a necessity, but very useful after
the freshman year) every weekend

where they are treated to the
finest soul music from all over the
south. Though drugs are rarely pa
tronized, the state liquor store in
Lexington has the highest per capita
volume in Virginia.’

Home On The Range

By Betty E. Munger
Manager, W&L Bookstore

In spring a young man’s fancy
turns to—what he has been think-
ing about all winter. And this ap-
plies to food as much as to love!
Visitors often express surprise that
a bookstore in a men’s college
should have a cooking section. But
as in France, the great chefs around
here are men, too. Although there
is a brisk interest in such cookbooks
as “The Impoverished Student's
Guide to Cookery, Drinkery and
Housekeepery” throughout the year,
it is in the spring that the real surge
comes.

One sees students and their dates
prowling the aisles of the supermar-
kets in search of new ways to cook
hamburgers or something that will
feed an unknown number of friends
easily. This is where such books as

“The College Cookbook: After
Hamburgers, What?” and “The |
Never Cooked Before Cookbook”

comes in very handily. Even people
who view the whole procedure with

considerable alarm find Peg Brac-
ken’s “I Hate To Cook Cookbook”
enough to send them to the kitchen
quite happily.

Then one can move on to more
esoteric gourmet-type cooking. With
“The Ten-Minute Gourmet Cook-
book” there is no limit to special
foods that can be gotten up of a
warm summer evening. Other books
along the same line are: “Posh
Foods,” “Our Man in the Kitchen”
and the famous “French Chef's
Cookbook” by Julia Child.

Of course, all those June weddings
coming along accounts for part of
the cookbook rush. Such gifts as
“The Joy of Cooking” and “Glori-
ous Stews” (good on the economic
situation of new, hopefully careful,
budgeters) are welcomed by young
brides.

Finally, there are special interest
cookbooks such as the “Natural
Foods Cookbook,” Mexican and
Italian Cookbooks—and the intrigu-
ing “Home Brewing Without Fail!”

College Dropout Charged
With Narcotics Murder

College dropout Alvin Bumin, 22,

of Short Hills, New Jersey, goes
on trial tomorrow in Rockbridge
County Circuit Court on charges

of murdering his ex-girl friend with
an overdose of heroin.

Bumin is accused of killing Ann
Phetamine, 19, whose body was
found February 14 in the living
room of defendant's apartment in
nearby East Goshen Gap. Both Miss
Phetamine and Bumin were former
students at East Goshen Gap Uni-
versily.

Attorneys for both sides expressed
confidence on the eve of the trial.
“We expect to show beyong a
reasonable doubt that the defend-
ant committed this horrible crime,”
said assistant Commonwealth's At-
torney Philip G. Gardner.

A spokesman for the defense,
however, scoffed at the prosecution’s
claim. “They have no case at all.

Miss Red announced her candi-
dacy last week, after filing her peti-
tion with the Secretary of the Stu-
dent Body. Her decision to run was
inspired partly in jest and partly
by an encouragement from admini-
strators for her to take an active
interest in extra-curricular affairs.
After consideration of the idea, Miss
Red decided that her running in
a campaign would be extremely
beneficial in her integration into the
W&L community.

In order to help her win the
election, Miss Red is beginning, in
her words, “...a rather flamboyant
campaign...” to attract student at-
tention and support. Her plans in-
clude concerts and rallies.

Her stated goal, if she be elected,
is to unite the sophomore class as
a class. Mention was made of the
crumbling of class unity due to stu-

dents’ moving to apartments and
fraternity houses. To combat this
divergence, Miss Red suggests a

Sophomore Council to be used as
a sounding board.

Miss Red feels that she offers a
distinct alternative to those mem-
bers of the class who are tired of
the regularity of life at WAL.

By Greg Raetz

(Editor’s Note: The Ring-tum Phi
takes great pleasure in presenting its
weekly columnist for the coming
year, Greg Raetz. His column,
“Through A Spyglass, Darkly,” is
intended to be an expression of his
views on campus issues, We urge
your indulgence; and we invite your
comments.)

A conspicious result of last weeks
election is runaway consternation
among many students. Fran Law-
rence, an avowed reformer, edged
out Joe Tompkins, the EC establish-
ment candidate, by twenty-one votes
—winning a hairline election vic-
tory with 2/3 of the student body
voting.

What concerns these students is
not that the establishment was beat-
en (no one is really happy with the
EC), but rather who beat it. Fran
Lawrence, whose appearance hardly
suggests a campus conservative, put
his candidacy before the student
body on a platform of change .. .
coeducation, modification of the
honor system, and fewer fraterni-

Consternation? Over What?

   

ties.

Needless to say, his ideas did not
go down well with a large portion
of the tradition-minded, conserva-
tive students and faculty. Hence,
consternation at the very least. But,
is all lost? Exactly what does the
president of the student body do?
Why, he is the grand dragon of the
EC you answer.

Well, then, what does the EC do?
Why, it conducts honor trials (if
these are not voted out of existence)
and forms committees to submit
findings to the administration.
Whereupon, the administration, if
it has already made a similiar study
and voted its approval, approves or
disapproves and then thanks the EC
for its effort and assures them that
a “meaningful dialogue” has been
conducted and that the discussion
has been “releyanf” and will be
considered—in the fiture.

This analysis must be largely ac-
curate, for how many students know
who Marvin C. Henberg is? And
for those who do, try naming some
of his accomplishments.

In the five years that our con-
ference has been in existence, Wash-
ington College, from Chestertown,
Maryland, has gone undefeated in
lacrosse until this year. Defeated by
U.N.C. and Towson State, the team
from Maryland ventured into the
valley last Saturday, only to be de-
feated by the Generals: 10-4,

In the first half of the game Bill
Ingersoll, from Chestertown him-
self, kept Washington scoreless. The
Generals, on the other hand, made
six goals in this half. Washington
College did better in the second
half, scoring four goals, but the
Blue never gave them a chance for
victory. This was truly a big win
for the Generals. The defense of
Ned Coslett, Bill Brumback, and
Tommy Smith did an outstanding
job, while Scott Neese and Sam
Englehart proved vital to our
offense, Scott making 1 goal and 3
assists, and Englehart notching 5
goals. The W&L lacrosse team can
now claim to have beaten a team
which ranked fifth nationally in

On A Rampage |

1967, and which ranked first of
all small colleges over the decade.

Unfortunately, the team can't
celebrate this victory, for the stick-
men travel to Baltimore to go
against Loyola on April 30. Al-
though the Loyola team is young,
they will prove to be tough com-
petition. The Generals will have to
start out well, and play hard against
the Baltimore team that lost to
Penn State by only one point. With-
out a victory over Loyola, the di-
vision championship is lost.

Then on May 2, the University
of North Carolina, led by two all-
Americans, Harper Peterson and
Pete Cramer, will come up to Lex-
ington and play the Generals at
2:30. Their goalie was awarded the
Markland Kelly Award last year,
which ranked him the best goalie
in the country. The North Carolina
team has only two losses, one to
U.Va. and the other to Maryland,
Hopefully, W&L will add another
loss to their record this Saturday.

The Generals ran afoul of more
bad luck on the baseball diamond,
losing twice last week. Hampden-
Sydney took a 10 inning 8-7 de-
cision Wednesday, and Lynchburg
rallied to beat Washington and Lee
7-2 last Friday.

Catcher Stu Friedmann ignited a
six-run inning for Lynchburg Col-
lege, sending Bruce King’s second
pitch of the inning over the left-
centerfield fence to tie the score
2-2. Eddie Carter's bases-loaded
single provided two more runs, and
pitcher Keith Scruggs added another
with an infield single. Steve Good-
man’s shot sent home the Hornets’
final tallies.

Scruggs got off to a shaky start,
walking lead-off man, Rob LaRue,
who scored on Doug Clelan’s long
single down the right field line.

The suave W&L Soccer team is
again on the ball for a little Spring
training. After a fine initial turn-
out we've had a good core of regu-
lars with new faces turning up
everyday. (Some of this however,
we attribute to the fact that a few
guys were hit in the chin with the
ball.) We're practicing from 3-4:30
on the Rugby field and we welcome
newcomers, (we'd even welcome
some of you old guys back). Daily,
we've been doing some short ball-
handling exercises and then some
quite un-routine scrimmage work.
One goal last week for instance,
was scored by a motorcyclist.

Last Sunday, our fabulous team
handily defeated the VMI squad in
a practice game held on the Rugby
field. This was accomplished by

Tennis Team Has Midas Touch

Chances are there will be no
songs written about it, but when
it comes to “rolling along,” the
W&L tennis team has Old Man
River beat by a mile. The tennis
Generals have laid waste to all
obstacles this year, Well, almost all.
There was that unfortunate en-
counter with Duke earlier in the
year. But the splendid play of his
team recently has pleased Coach
Canfield. “It's pleasing, but not sur-
prising really. The boys have been
working hard and it’s paying off.”

fom McJunkin continues to set
the pace as he is still undefeated in
his five matches. Marshall Wash-
burn has won the most singles
matches, seven victories under his
belt. Combine this with five doubles
victories (Stan Taylor is his play-
ing partner) and the impressive
freshman has a whopping 12 wins,
Jeff Driscoll and Bill Gatlin both
have 6-3 records in singles and as
the number one doubles team, they
are also 6-3. Since a forfeit over

 

have been unbeatable in four out-
ings. They are now 8-1.

Virginia Commonwealth provided
no competition whatsoever for the
rampaging W&L team as they were
victims of a 9-0 shellacking. Gatlin,
Washburn, and Driscoll put thei
singles matches away easily, and for
the first time Canfield was able to
use freshman Lee Thalheimer and
Dave Gilbert in the number five
and six singles slots. Thalheimer
responded to the opportunity by
burying his opponent, 6-2, 6-1. Gil-
bert had a little more difficulty but
still won.

Old Dominion fared only a little
better against the Generals in that
they were not blank. The doubles
team of Taylor-Washburn continued
to roll, winning handily, as the Gen-
erals won the match 8-1.

Last week’s matches against
Hampden-Sydney and Lynchburg
were not exactly laughers, though.

much needed doubles victory. Most
of the individual matches were long
affairs with few being decided by
six game sets.

But Coach Canfield has all his
doubles corps to thank for the
Lynchburg victory, the Generals
handed the Hornets a 6-3 loss, but
only after a sweep of all the doubles
matches. Gatlin, Washburn, and
John Kefauver were the only singles

winners, but combined with the
doubles sweep, it was enough for
the Generals’ eight victory in nine
decisions.

There are three matches left (with
U.Va., Emory and Henry, and
Sewanee) before the tennis team
goes to the CAC tournament, and it
looks as if Coach Canfield has his
team bulldozin’ its way to a fourth
straight CAC championship.

Delts Win Intramurals

By reaching the finals in volley-
ball and taking fourth place in the
track meet, Delta Tau Delta cap-
tured the intramural championship
this year. Intramural Director Frank
Davidson unfficially announced that
the SAE’s or the Phi Kap’s can al
best lose by ten points to the Delts.

The year however has been high-
lighted by no single domination.
The lead in intramurals changed
constantly and made for frantic
“calls to arms” in most fraternity
houses, The single most important
factor this year was participation.
Only the Phi Delts won three sports;
the Delts only won wrestling.

“Intramurals were extremely suc-
cessful this year,” says Davidson,
“but we are exploring possible
changes for next year.” Coach Cor-
rigan is also checking programs in
other schools. Deferred rush is caus-
ing a problem with freshman
participation.

provided to give the student certain
information and to permit him to
schedule his classes for each of the
three terms without conflict. Also, if
the student has prepared his PLAN-
NING CARD carefully it should
lessen the time needed for his adviser
him. Afterward, the stu
dent has in his possession an accur-
ite list of the courses for which he

signed up.

The differences in procedure,
from last spring registration, lie in
the fact that each class has a day or
days designated for it to register.

rhe FRESHMEN will register on
May 11 and May 12. Those whose
last names begin with A through K
on May II. Those whose last names
begin with L through Z on May 12.

The SOPHOMORE class will reg-
ster on May 13

the JUNIOR class (plus any re
turning SENIORS) will register on
May 14

the detailed procedures for each
class and information for those stu-
dents not returning will be posted
on the main bulletin board.

rounded team. Hopefully, we can
get a game scheduled with them for
sometime next week. Again, co-
captain Hyatt came thru with a
statement: “It will be a very stimu
lating and exciting game with many

‘touch and go’ situations.” The
coaches said they have been hard
at work trying to fill weaknesses

in the women’s team but they feel
that the girls will come thru

everyone will come out and sup-
port the team.

We've got a good line-up prepar-

YOUNG REPUBLICANS

The University will be deprived
of “much of its distinctiveness” if
it becomes co-educational, Young
Republicans on campus declared in
a resolution passed last week

The YRs voted to urge the ad
ministration and Board of Trustees
“to maintain an all-male student
body.”

The resolution, introduced by
Bruce MacQueen, senior commerce
major and recent president of the
Young Republican Chapter, states
that the men-only standard “is a
dominant characteristic of the Uni
versity a8 we know it,”

his motion was passed.

Kumpuris then moved that the
EC sponsor a luncheon for presi-
dents of all student organizations.
Ihe luncheon, to be held for the
leaders of next year’s organizations,
would hopefully promote more co-
operation among student groups.
The motion passed unanimously and
Kumpuris was appointed to organize
the event during May.

President Henberg assigned cur-
rent EC members to duty in over-
seeing next Monday’s elections and
stressed that each voter casts two
ballots for his class EC representa-
tives and one for the other officers.

It was also announced that the
EC will accept nominations from
the Student Body for the Gilliam
Award. This is awarded annually
to the student who has contributed
most to the student body,

The meeting was adjourned after
an exectutive session.

President-elect Lawrence, who ob-
served the meeting, felt that the
University Club idea “indicates that
we are beginning to realize that our
viable old institutions are evoling
into more pertinent and worthwhile
ones,”

Secretary-elect Murray said he
was “impressed” by the meeting and
commented that he was “looking
forward to the job ahead.”
