weekend is a time when the alum-
ni board of directors can meet.
‘*The 20 member alumni board of
directors only meets twice a year:
at Homecoming and_ Reunion
Weekend. The board has a full
three-day agenda, in addition to
the other reunion activities sched-

The weekend’s activities will
begin on Thursday evening at 8:30
p.m. with the opening reunion as-
sembly in Lee Chapel. Edgar F.
Shannon Jr., ’39, former president
of the University of Virginia and
a member of the W&L Board of
Trustees from 1974-1986, will be
the guest speaker.

Sessoms said, ‘‘We try to get
a speaker that will really attract
the alumni back for Thursday

Sessoms said last year students
had a strong showing at Philip
Labro’s lecture and he hopes they
will come out for Shannon’s talk.

In addition to the traditional
receptions, banquets and meetings,
returning alumni will have the op-
portunity to attend several infor-
mational sessions and panel dis-
cussion groups pertaining to a
wide range of topics.

Jim Farrar Jr., associate alumni

secretary, said, ‘‘We strive to
reach that balance between the
social and the substantive. In

keeping with the goals of the uni-
versity, we try to provide things
that are timely and of interest to
our alumni.’’At 4 p.m. on Thurs-

More applications submitted for Fraternity Renaissance

 

By Michael Badger
Staff Reporter

 

Lambda Chi and Phi Kappa
Sigma are the two latest W&L
fraternities to submit applications
for participation in the University
sponsored Fraternity Renovation
Program. As of yet, neither
, application has been approved by
the Fraternity Renovation Steering
‘ Committee,

The Fraternity Renovation
Program is the most extensive
‘aspect of the Fraternity

Renaissance Program. That
program requires all fraternity
chapters at W&L to bring their
houses into compliance with the
Standards for Fraternities at
Washington and Lee University,
established in the fall of 1987, and
to "maintain the levels’ of
responsibility, safety, and
excellence emphasized _ therein."
In implementing the Renaissance
program the Board of Trustees
hopes to create a more
constructive fraternity environment
than that found at W&L today.

According to Dean of
Fraternities Leroy C. "Buddy"
Atkins, any fraternity chapter that
fails to bring itself into
compliance with those standards
by the end of the Renaissance
program will no longer be
recognized by the University. He
said also that the University will
encourage that chapter's — national
organization to withdraw
recognition of the chapter

Farrar said the planning of
alumni weekend was a team effort
by the entire university. He said,
“We realize that alumni come
back to reestablish old friendships,
both with classmates and with the
faculty. They return to the univer-
sity for sentimental reasons, to re
establish ties that have been
important to them over the years.
And I am real pleased with the
program that we have to offer
them.”’

SAB in debt because
of ‘comedy of errors’

 

By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Activities Board
(SAB) told the Executive
Committee Monday night that it is
currently $14,000 in debt due to ai
number of miscalculations.

SAB Chairman David Grove
described the events which caused
the debt as "basically a comedy of
errors."

According to Grove, when the
board decided to book Little Feat,
members were under _ the

impression that they had $18,000
to spend. But, miscommunication

between SAB treasurer Mike
Carroll and Fancy Dress
Chairwoman Liz Smith lead to
inaccurate _ ledgers. After

misplaced bills were paid and
ledgers were corrected, the SAB
found themselves with only $2000
to cover the expenses for the
$26,000 Little Feat concert.

OPINION

Welcome home

Many of us who attend Washington and Lee University
today like to think the school has never been better. There
is more than a touch of arrogance in such an assumption,
but those undergraduates bold enough to make such a claim

 

. are not entirely alone; in fact, they are occasionally

supported by alumni. If you believe Robert Mottley, a
member of the class of 1964 whose column appears
elsewhere on this page, W&L is at its height (albeit
perhaps only temporarily).

Of course, if W&L is on an uphill climb, that does not
denegrate the W&L men and women who preceded us.
They and the work they did here are the main -- and
perhaps only -- reasons their alma mater continues to
improve. If all those who proudly display W&L diplomas
added something to this place during their college days, if
each of them left General Lee’s college a little better than
they found it, then their alma mater has, quite literally,

‘ never been better.

Thus change, at a school students care about, is a good

_ and certain occurance. As W&L English professor and

. hot a lament for past times,

alumnus Sidney Coulling said far better than we ever
could, ‘‘Washington and Lee, like the rest of the world,
has changed. The helpful response to this fact, however, is
but a willingness to

- understand the changes that have taken place and to make

“ whatever additional changes may

be desirable in the
future.”’

But much of what makes Washington and Lee the

_ special and successful place it is cannot be improved upon.

>

a

. The Honor System and the Speaking Tradition, we hope

and believe, are far more than traditions, far more than

~’ quaint relics displayed to tourists who visit the Lee Chapel

basement. And, as much as the success of W&L may

_ depend on constant tinkering, adjusting and growing, our

school’s future also rests, to quote Coulling, ‘‘on our

' continuing success in preserving two of the fundamental
_ virtues in our tradition, integrity and civility.’’

So welcome home, alumni. No doubt you will find

., today’s W&L is, in many ways, unlike the one you left
- upon graduation (and we’re certainly not just talking about

coeducation, although that may be the most obvious
alteration). We hope the changes you see have been for the
better.

But we hope you are not blinded by change. We hope
W&L has in some ways been a stubborn, static place,

’ resistent to the relaxation of ideals and standards that has

made the rest of the world a more unfriendly and less

.. honorable place in recent decades. May you find, as B.F.

Harlow ’97 did, that your home is here, your friends are

“here and your treasure and your heart are here. And may
“* you also find that integrity and civility, honor and courtesy,

are also here -- as strong as ever.

Spectator editors

call for EC funds

- OUR VIEW

.. By Paul Lagarde and
_ Ray Welder

~~ avenues for students are sufficient
‘ for the students to voice their opi-

‘ student funds to the Washington
- and Lee Spectator and the appro-

 priations process in general...

 

the Spectator that deals with poli-
tics will be more aligned towards
contemporary issues and will tend
to cover them through a variety of
methods, including short essays,
book reviews, and interviews with
political personalities. Second,
The Ring-tum Phi is more aligned
towards general news, while the
Spectator plans to include investi-
gative articles on various campus
issues. Furthermore, to change
The Ring-tum Phi and the Political
Review to serve as the Spectator
hopes to function would downplay
the legitimate role that these two
publications already play on this
campus.

Another matter that was of
concern to members of the Publi-
cations Board was our “obvious
political agenda’’ that seems to
accompany what we honestly call
a ‘‘conservative editorial policy.’’

goals of the Spectator could be

W&L today: Wine, women and sex

 

MY VIEW
By Robert Mottley 64

 

I’ve written about Washington and Lee
only once before, in a 1970 column that ap-
peared in The Roanoke World News. ‘“The age
of Aquarius has struck in Lexington, and
clothes no longer make the man at General
Lee’s university,"’ I said then. That sounds
moronic today, but you have to understand the
extreme shock of a '64 graduate who discov-
ered that his well-loved collegiate culture had
completely disintegrated. In my time, only
six years before, a men’s clothing store was
the preferred townie business. Yet I had not
gone ten feet down the Colonnade before en-
countering ‘‘two apparitions from Greenwich
Village. One wore tie-dyed denims, a ragged
shirt, and an Army combat jacket. The other
was dressed in bell bottom trousers, a sweat-
shirt, and buckskin chaps. One had hair that
curled down his shoulders; his friend wore
muttonchop sideburns and an Edwardian
moustache. They had shoes on, but no socks.
These were the new W&L gentlemen, two
fraternity men on their way to class. One
fellow had not worn a tie the entire semester.
The other could not recall having on a formal
coat, except for his fraternity Christmas par-
[PES

I think now I really didn’t get past the
culture jolt, which affected the rest of the
column. A seeming quote from Dr. James G.
Leyburn, ‘‘the Silver Fox’’ himself, who
praised ‘‘an intellectual zeal among the stu-
dents’ and said the change in fashion had
“erased any distinction between rich and poor
youths,’ somehow became linked to a less
lofty comment by an unnamed professor: ‘‘I
don’t let them into class if I can smell ’em
coming down the corridor.’ (I can now re-

veal that the anonymous source was Dr. Keith
Shillington, whose olfactory skills, developed
in laboratories, were unrivaled on the faculty.
And yes, I suppose that Leyburn would be
mortified to be quoted in the same paragraph
as Shillington. But, Leyburn had pegged me
as a steady B+, never quite of the purple,

  

CRC: Handle
with care

To the Editors:

Guys -- picture the scene. It’s a Satur-
day night party at your fraternity house.
You’ve had a few beers with your buddies
and you're having a great time. Unique
huh? Well now it’s Tuesday and you’ve
been summoned to go before the infamous
CRC. Why? Hell if you know!

There have been jokes about this happen-
ing since before the CRC started hearing
cases, but rumor has it that the jokes are
becoming a reality. I’m not criticizing the
institution of the CRC. I believe it serves
an important function that is often ignored.
However, it should not be used for trivial
cases loaded with double standards.

Girls/Women, before you take a guy be-
fore the CRC, ask yourself if you’re taking
action because:

1) You fooled around with a guy and
now he doesn’t want you as a girlfriend.

2) You think the guy is a real jerk.

3) To make an example showing other
guys what a powerful weapon the CRC is.

4) To get attention.

OR 5) The person in question sexually ha-
rassed you, either physically or verbally, to
an extent that punishment, such as expulsion,
should ensue.

Just as the guys here have a bad reputa-
tion for being male chauvinist and vicious
date rapists, W&L females have the reputa-
tion for being militant feminists (aka female
chauvinists) and for crying ‘‘date rape’’
whenever it’s convenient. Both extremes are
immature and unproductive means of dealing
with the opposite sex.

Women have a long way to go before
they receive equal treatment with men.
“*Tattling’’ to the CRC, however, won’t earn
any more respect than when we “‘tattled’’ to

 

while Shillington had let me through organic
chemistry with a D. It seems cheap revenge
now, but was satisfying then.) I swore after
that visit to Lexington that I would never
return, for reunions or to write again about
the university. I’ve kept the vow about class
reunions, but I did go back to W&L last Oc-
tober for the first time in 18 years.

An ominous intimation of what I would
see came as I coaxed my °75 Pontiac over
Afton Mountain. At a steady 40 mph, we
were passed by a series of horse vans. The
vans turned south on the Interstate at Staun-
ton, and pulled off at the first Lexington exit.
I stopped at an Exxon station outside of town
and changed into a suit. Old habits die hard;

| prefer to think of W&L in
the present tense, and not
just because of that beauti-
ful lady with a sleepy smile.
In truth, | like the place to-
day more than | ever did.

 

 

I would change back to jeans before supper at
my fraternity. Here are the notes I took on
campus that afternoon:

Where do these gorgeous women come
from? Just got a sleepy, friendly, definitely
inquiring look from a lady in a flak jacket
and designer jeans crossing the street in front
of Sigma Nu. In New York, you are lucky to
get a look like that in the fourth month of a
relationship. 1 absent-mindedly follow her
into the street and am nearly run over by a
red Porsche. Classy obituary, anyway, better
than colliding with a horse van.

I see women everywhere. All beautiful.
The guys are beautiful. The huge shepherd
and St. Bernard dogs that roam everywhere
are beautiful. Surely Tina Brown has her
trendy photographers around for Vanity Fair.
No question that W&L has ‘‘the look.’’ Hav-
ing taught as an adjunct journalism professor
at New York University, 1 do miss seeing
faces with ethnic character, or some scowling
misanthrope with bad breath. The homogeniz-

the teacher in elementary school. Unless the
seriousness of the problem demands recogni-
tion by a body like the CRC -- such as
threats or true date rape -- try to confront
the problem yourself. There are a lot of
immature jerks in this world, as well as
some good guys who get wrongfully ac-
cused, but being a jerk isn’t a crime. By
using the CRC for a ‘‘witch hunt’, the ac-
cused will become martyrs while a few girls
stereotype the rest of us. The way I see it,
it’s unfair to both sexes, so think long and
hard before you start making trivial accusa-
tions. Otherwise, you’re probably doing
more damage than good.

Sincerely,
Lynette Goodman

thanks, W&L

To the Editors:

Graduation is upon us, and I am feeling
very grateful. I am not only thankful that I
am graduating, | am thankful for having had
the opportunity to be a student at Washing-
ton and Lee. There are so many people to
thank: professors, students, librarians, mainte-
nance people, administrators, etc. My list of
thank-yous goes on. Indeed, I must thank
even the governments of Virginia and of the
United States of America, since I received
financial support from both institutions. My
education was not a bootstrap effort. It was
a very precious gift that was given to me by
many, many people. Since I have been for-
tunate to receive a good deal of financial
help, I may realize more than most how
gracious the gift of education is. Not only
did I not pay for my education, but I was

To the Editors:

S.M.A.R.T. (Students for Moral Aware-
ness and Responsible Thinking) is the orga-
nization recently formed by a group of mor- | *
ally concerned students. These students are
concerned that a majority of students at
Washington and Lee coming from upper |’
class backgrounds are very much unaware of
the plight of the underclass. Thus, the focal
point of S.M.A.R.T.’s activities will be a |‘
newsletter that provides information about | ,
issues of the underclass. From this spring-
board, §.M.A.R.T. hopes to sponsor lectures, | ‘
benefits, fundraisers, and campus human
rights discussions focusing on these issues.
The major goal of S.M.A.R.T. is that stu- | ‘
dents, because they will receive underclass
knowledge to complement their upperclass
knowledge, will develop a moral awareness | ‘
concerning major issues confronting this | ,
nation. Upon becoming morally aware of
these issues, $.M.A.R.T. hopes to hone these
skills so that Washington and Lee’s gradu- | 4
ating students will be responsible thinkers.

LAGARDE

(continued from page 2)

 

Now perhaps if the Spectator were
to concentrate solely with Ameri-
can political issues, our conserva-
tism could be equated with a po-
litical agenda. The fact is, how-
ever, that a good deal of the Spec-
tator will be devoted to University
affairs, while other parts will con-
centrate on American culture or
other non-political aspects of the
national scene.

Eight members of the Execu-
tive Committee had the same mis-
givings: the Spectator is political
and thus not eligible for student
funds. Executive Committee
member Willard Dumas stated in
the March 23 edition of The Ring-
tum Phi that ‘‘political, social, and
religious organizations that do not
represent the student body as a
whole’ are not eligible for student

same to all these (invisible) unde-
sirable groups just waiting to be
funded?

All the contradictions here are
disturbing. One might speculate
that the Publications Board just
did not want outside competition.
This would not be only idle con-
jecture, however, since the Publi-
cations Board openly admitted that
one of their fears was that the
Spectator would over-saturate the
advertising market causing diffi-
culties for other publications.
Both the economic free market
and the free market of ideas take
a beating with this decision.

More important than the Spec-
tator’s funding obstacles are the
problems with the entire appropri-
ations process. Bureaucratic sna-
fus can pop up at any time the
EC wants them to. For example,
the EC on the night we first came
to them, appeared extremely sup-
portive; they all but promised us
their help. They only wanted to

Obviously, EC funding guidelines are

enforced selectively.

 

funds. We challenge any student
to read the list of student organi-
zations that are funded to see if
they represent the student body as
a whole. Organizations such as
Ariel, Amnesty International, the
Rugby Club, the Minority Student
Association, Trident, and numer-
ous others clearly do not represent
the student body as a whole. But,
these organizations do receive stu-
dent funds and, we would argue,
deserve them. Obviously, the
guidelines are enforced selectively.
Mr. Dumas’ reasoning for delegat-
ing student funds is misguided--as
are the seven other EC members
that voted against the Spectator.
Further, some EC members be-
lieve that if they funded the: Spec-
tator, they would be forced to
fund any and all student organiza-
tions that applied for funds. Ex-
amples of such groups cited to
keep the Spectator from obtaining
funds were a hypothetical gay stu-
dent union or a neo-nazi group.
Now, we wonder, is it really that
difficult to distinguish between an
alternative forum of discourse, and
a group of skinheads or an organi-
zation that advocates unsafe sex?
Moreover, if the guidelines can be
enforced selectively on the Specta-
tor, why can’t the EC do the

check with the Publications Board
to see why we were given “‘provi-
sional’’ recognition. (This was a
term that had never been used be-
fore, and we were given that label
by Publications Board President
Betsy Vegso.) But in our next
meeting with the EC, all sorts of
potential ‘‘problems’’ came up
that were not even considered in
the previous meeting. In the Ex-
ecutive Committee’s zeal for prop-
er ‘‘legal’’ decisions, it has
neglected common sense and set
an ominous precedent for future
student initiative.

The staff and supporters of the
Washington and Lee Spectator be-
lieved that we were eligible for
funds. Although the 8 to 5 EC
vote was discouraging, it will not
stop us from attempting to estab-
lish an alternate forum for student
expression. Our first issue will
appear tomorrow, but we do not
consider it our premier issue. Be-
cause of obvious fiscal restraints--
which we hope to ameliorate with
friendly donations--we were forced
to scale down this issue and in-
clude mostly straight text. It is
our aim to begin next fall with a
high-quality magazine that will not
only make our staff proud, but
also the whole W&L community.

about poltergeists, nasty ones that
haven’t taken to gentrification. In
contrast, the ghosts from the Lee
family tombs in the Chapel no
longer strike fear in Phi Kaps
Staggering down the hill to Red
Square. Two students, a girl and
a boy, laughed at this hoary remi-
niscence. ‘You still see blue
lights and vapors some nights.”’
Then they talk about how crack
isn’t yet a problem in town, about
the emerging aggressively liberal
administration, and finally, one
smasher for a finale. ‘‘You'll
live,’ they predict, ‘‘to see a
woman president of W&L. And
she’ll probably be black.’’ Gener-
al Lee’s ghost has either taken the
long view, or relocated to Col Al-
to.

 

I am told the record now to
Hollins is 22 minutes in a Por-
sche, probably the one that nearly
ran me down. That’s an average
134 mph on the Interstate auto-
bahn. I can remember people
who were killed trying to beat 50
minutes.

Someone seems to be making
the Lyric Theatre into a boutique.
I suppose I got my real education
at W&L in the Lyric, where I first
saw La Dolce Vita, The Seventh
Seal, La Strada, and best of all,
Smiles of a Summer Night. They
can all be rented today, but pop-
ping a tape in the VCR doesn’t
bring back the ambience of the
Lyric. Rats rustled down by the
screen, and the bald gnome from
Brooklyn who owned the theatre
would sit impassively in the pro-
jection booth after counting his re-
ceipts. Beckett would use him as
a metaphor for God, seeding the
young with images that could not
be shrugged off. I remember pro-
found conversations with my bud-
dies afterwards, when we were all
loaded just enough to tackle the
questions of life and death.

So, make what you will of
these notes. I think the problem
with most alumni is that they are
looking for what Henry James
called ‘“‘the visitable past.” I
guess you see what you want. I
prefer to think of W&L in the
present tense, and not just because
of that lady with a sleepy smile.
In. truth, I like the place today
more than I ever did.

Sbar’s View Categorical movies could change the world

 

By Jon Sbar

 

In a brown-nosing effort to impress my friends,
editors and the Nobel Peace Prize Nominating Com-
mittee I have decided to write an informative and
interesting column on a subject that could one day
decide the fate of the universe-movies. Yes reader,
while you have been busy moving up the career
ladder or getting a law degree, or buying lottery
tickets, I have been sitting around my house with a
VCR watching thousands (maybe millions) of mov-
ies, eating Fruit Loops and drinking Old Milwaukee
Light. Instead of reviewing each movie individually
I have broken them down into movie categories. As
you read my reviews keep in mind that my movie
analysis was formulated with the same complicated
Statistical process used by the famous scientist who
invented Super Glue. Here are the important catego-
ries:

Westerns: A movie about a_tobacco-spitting,
whisky drinking, gun-toting maverick who spends his
time gun fighting until he feels like riding to Mexi-
co in search of gold, Mexican women and an all-
around good time. The majority of cowboy protago-
nists are normally too busy to shower or shave.

Bump and Grind Porn: Because these movies
are mostly self-evident and generally easy to under-
stand they are fun for the whole family. The low
point of porn flick however is that most of the
actors couldn’t have made it past the second round
on Star Search.

Police Partnerships: Some rebellious street smart
policeman named Rocco forms an unexpected part-

woman or a transvestite, in order to chase down a
deranged, sadistic perverted psychopathic drug king-
pen who has killed all of Rocco’s friends and fami-
ly.

Foreign Flicks: The trademark of a Foreign
Flick is something Siskel and Ebert call "realism".
What "realism" amounts to is scenes of people using
the bathroom and flossing their teeth. Some Foreign
Flicks have been known to get a little boring.

Rambo Flicks: A movie in which Sylvester
Stallone plays a war veteran who travels to semi-
exotic areas of the world rescuing prisoners who
everyone else thought were killed during the war of
1812. As he travels through dense jungles Rambo
carries more weapons on his back than you could
find in the city of Miami.

Florence G. Cook, administra-

department, will retire May 31,
ending her 33-year career at
Washington and Lee University.

Cook began working at the
journalism department in 1956.
She said, ‘‘It’s about time to re-

some courses over here that I
haven’t been able to all these

Springfest °89 may be for you.

There will be volleyball,
softball, hamburgers, hot dogs
and two bands on the Law
School fields. The first band,
Cho, will play from 2:30 to 4
p.m., and then Lost in the Su-
permarket will play until later
in the afternoon.

ulty members and staff over the
years.

‘‘The excitement § and
challenges involved with campus
life have been very rewarding.’’
She added, ‘‘I love seeing gradu-
ates when they come back.”’

Senior Betsy Parkins said if
she had to choose her major
again, it would still be journalism
because of Mrs. Cook’s involve-
ment in the journalism department.

‘“‘To me, Mrs. Cook is the one
who holds everything together in
the journalism department,’’ said
Parkins. ‘‘Journalism students feel
part of a large close-knit system
and it is because of her. I know
she will be really missed.”’

 

In addition to games on the
field and good music, there
will be a dunking booth featur-
ing familiar faces on the W&L
campus. President Wilson will
guest star from 3:15 to 3:45
p.m. All of the proceeds will
go to help the Rockbridge Ar-
ea Hospice, which gives care
to the terminally ill.

This event is sponsored by
the Independent Union and the
Minority Student Association.
An ‘invitation to attend is ex-
tended to all students.

John Jennings, chairman of the
journalism department, said,
“Florence has been a_ central
member of the department. She
has served as sort of an informal
advisor to students, and has
become almost indespensible to

us.

Cook said the biggest change
that she has seen within the
department is the increase in jour-
nalism majors. She said, ‘‘I think
the department has expanded so
much because of the women,
There could very possibly be a
continual increase in majors.’’

Another change Cook has wit-
nessed within the department is its

relocation. She said, ‘‘When I first
started working here, the depart-
ment was in Payne Hall where
Dean John’s office is now located.
Then Reid Hall was remodeled for
the journalism department and we
moved in around 1969,”’

Cook said the department has
also increased in its number of
faculty members. When she first
started, Cook said, there were only

two or three members and now

there are five,

Cook works from 9 a.m. to 2

worked the student calendar. I get

student holidays off as well as the«

Use bumper .
to display _
school spirit -

By Allen Ladd y
Staff Reporter

 

y

Virginia’s Department of Mo-
tor Vehicles has created a new
way for Washington and Lee Uni-
versity supporters to show their
school spirit--college emblem _li-
cense plates.

The new plate features the
Washington and Lee crest and
emblem in the center of the tag.
Brian Shaw, W&L director of
communications, said the tags
should be ready sometime this
spring and can be _ purchased
through the D.M.V. ‘

The new auto tags are being
made for colleges and universities
in the state that have approved
them. However, many of the
state’s 78 colleges have not
submitted designs for a new plate
because the $25 fee for the plate
goes entirely to the D.M.V.

The General Assembly
authorized the plates one year aga
but several schools, including the
University of Virginia, may not
have their own tag because they
have not been able to persuade
state legislators to work out a
profit-sharing arrangement. ‘

“Although Washington and
Lee doesn’t receive any of the
money, we see the tags as fred
advertisement,’’ said Shaw. '

Shaw also said that when the
plates are ready a notice will
appear in in the alumni magazine,

failed to adequately compensate
for the expenses incurred. Grove
said that ticket sales are not
expected to fully compensate for
the cost of events because the
SAB moderates the price of
tickets, paying for a few dollars of
every ticket cost. As a result, the
SAB did anticipate a $7000 to
$10,000 loss; however, the board
sold fewer tickets than they
anticipated, resulting in a $13,000
loss from the Little Feat concert
alone.

Failing to properly budget
other concerts also contributed to
the debt, Grove said. He
explained that funds allocated for
concerts were used to cover band
fees while other expenses, such as
commission for the band’s agent,
security, stage construction and
refreshments, were not considered.
Finally, several of FD bills
received last week pulled the SAB
even further in debt.

EC President Christopher de
Movellan expressed displeasure
with the SAB’s mismanagement of
funds. de Movellan suggested that
members failed to perform
responsibly in their positions. He
specifically cited the inaccessibility
of certain members, who were
involved in a number of other

 

extracurricular activities. de
Movellan suggested that the
1989 - 1990 SAB chairman,

Charles Conklin, carefully monitor
members and dismiss those
members who fail to perform
adequately.

Representatives from Contact,
the Fencing Team, the Political

Review and the Ariel also reported
their budgetary status to EC
members. All groups were found
to be financially stable.

In other EC business, Senior
Robert Owen asked the committee
to consider assisting Reference
Librarian, Public Service Librarian
and Assistant Professor Peggy
Hays. Hays is currently being
considered for tenure at W&L.
Owen said that Hays is in
jeopardy of failing to receive
tenure because of an unfair review
of her work. Owen described Hays
a faculty member willing to go
the extra mile for students with

library services, as well as
personal help. Personality
conflicts and administrative
decisions based on incomplete

information will ultimately harm
W&L students, Owen said, In
order to publicize the issue and
show student support for Hays,
Owen wrote a letter to the editors
of the Ring-Tum Phi which was
published last week and presented
President John Wilson with a
petition signed by 235 students.

Senior EC Representative
Alston Parker agreed to speak
with Head Librarian Barbara
Brown and further investigate the
circumstances surrounding — the
consideration of Hays’ tenure. de
Movellan said that he would speak
with Wilson, Dean of Students
Lewis John and Vice President of
Academic Affairs and Dean of the
College John Elrod. de Movellan
also said he may mention the
matter to the Board of Trustees,
when he dines with them on the

weekend of May 20.
Junior EC Representative
Brandon Canaday updated the

committee on efforts to control the
disappearance of dishes, utensils
and food from walking out of
Evans Dining Hall. At last
week’s meeting, the committee
passed a motion calling for a
warning notice to be printed on

EC stationary, signed by de
Movellan and posted in Evans.
This week, the committee

approved the text of the notice.

Patrons will be reminded that
they can be expelled for taking a
spoon, and the notice will warn
that taking dishes, utensils and
food out of Evans "may be
investigated as a possible honor
system violation."

Sophomore EC Representative
Willard Dumas said that Registrar

Scott Dittman will discuss with
the EC distribution procedures for
grade change forms. Currently
grade change forms are not
released to students. Keeping the
forms out of student hands limits
the temptation to forge a
professor’s signature and commit
an honor violation.

Dumas reported at last week’s
meeting that a professor believed
this procedure _ inappropriately
questioned the sincerity of students
in respect to the honor system.

Senior EC Representative John
McDonough said that on campus
taping footage for an honor
system video began today and will
continue over the next week.
The taping is occurring on
location, at various locations on
campus. The video will be used
to introduce the honor system to
perspectives, freshmen, first year
law students and new faculty
members.

 

REBUILD

 

(continued from page 1)

Once a fraternity’s application
to participate in the renovation
program has been deemed "fully
qualified" by the Renovation
Steering Committee, and its
renovation plans have been
accepted, the University will
advance financing for the
renovation, absorb current
mortgages, and manage _ the

renovations in retum for the title
of the fraternity house. This will
give the University significantly
more control over the maintenance
and regulation of the participating
fraternities.

As a result of this program,
participating fraternities will see
an increase in fraternity rent and
dues. Some of the additional
expenses will include money for
cleaning and maintenance of the
houses.

So far the applications of
Sigma Nu, Beta Theta Pi, Pi
Kappa Alpha, and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon have been accepted by the

Steering committee. The
Renovations will not begin until
March or April of next year.

According to Dean Atkins,
none of W&L’s three sororities
have yet applied. He said that
when the sororities do look to
establish chapter houses, which
may be a few years down the
road, they will have to come to a
uniform agreement so that they
will have equal facilities and will
receive them at the same time.
This agreement will most likely be
made through the Panhellenic
Society.

Netters fall to Hampton
to close regular season

NCAA Tennis ’89:

By Stuart Sheldon
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee
men’s tennis team ended its sea-
son Saturday against Hampton Un-
iversity, currently ranked first in
Division _ II. The international
Hampton squad easily handled the
Generals, serving them an 8-1 de-
feat.

The loss drops W&L’s record
to 8-10 on the season. Six of
those ten losses came at the hands
of D-I opponents, including four
straight at the start of the season.

W&L’s only point inthe match
came from No. 1 netter John Mor-
ris. His opponent, Luis
Nascimento, who was a doubles
finalist at last year’s NCAA D-II
Championships, quickly grabbed
the first set from Morris, 6-1.
‘“‘His game threw me off in the
first set,’’ said Morris. “‘He was
chipping my serves back low at
my feet.”’

Morris’ serve and volley game
brought him back, and he tied the
sets at 1-1 by wining the second
6-4. In the second set, according
to Morris, ‘‘I tried to move my
serves around, and get more first
serves in.’’ Morris did what he
wanted, and stayed in the hunt
against the No. 2 D-II tennis play-
er in the nation.

In the third and decisive set,
Morris jumped out in front, but
Nascimento battled hard. ‘“There
were four games that were tied at
30-30,’ Morris said, ‘‘and I won
them all.’’ Morris poured on the
gas, winning 6-2.

With the win, Morris moved
his season-long No. 1 record to
an impressive 16-5, and is ranked
5th in the nation by the Intercolle-
giate Tennis Coaches’ Association
D-III poll. The same poll puts
senior No. 2 man_ Bobby
Matthews (17-4) at No. 7, and fel-
low senior Robert Haley (14-7)
29th.

In doubles action, W&L’s No.

1 pair of Morris and Matthews
lost a match it could have won.
After being up a set (7-5) and two
breaks, the dynamic duo faltered
for a bit, dropping three match
points. The final score in the
match was 5-7, 7-5, 7-5 in favor
of Hampton. Ranked third in the
nation for doubles, Matthews and
Morris end their regular season at
174,

‘The Generals are far from dis-

couraged after the Hampton
match, however. ‘“‘Our team atti-
tude going into the Hampton

match was that it would be a
good warm-up before Nationals,’’
said Morris.

‘‘We scheduled this season to
be challenging and ambitious,”’
said head coach Gary Franke,
‘*And it has paid its dividends."

On Sunday, Franke participated
in a conference call with the other
members of the NCAA D-III
Tournament selection committee.
The group was responsible for
picking and seeding, or ranking,
the ten teams that would partici-
pate in the tournament in Kalama-
zoo, Michigan, next week.

The committee’s final ten
choices, in descending order, are:
University of California - Santa
Cruz [finished 2nd to W&L in
88], Swarthmore (3rd in °88},
Washington College [4th last
year], Kalamazoo [Sth last year],
W&L [numero uno], UC - San
Diego [8th], Sewanee [10th], Po-
mona-Pitzer and Brandeis (neither
sent squads in °88] and Claremont
[finished 9th].

“‘Our team is capable of beat-
ing any other team in the
country,’ said W&L’s  con-
servatively optimistic Franke.
“Some others can too. It only
takes five points on any given
day.”

The team will travel to
Kalamazoo late this week. Team
action will be May 14-17,
followed by three more days of
individual singles and doubles
play, May 18-21. ‘‘W&L is
ready,”’ said Morris.

Once again, The Ring-tum
Phi attempted to help its read-
ers follow the action at the up-
coming National Collegiate
Athletic Association’s Division
III Men’s Tennis Tournament.
Last year, with the games
played right in our own back
yard, you could take the paper
to the courts. If you're read-
ing this issue court-side while
cheering for the Generals, you
are to be admired: you drove
all the way to Kalamazoo,
Michigan.

If you lost big on _ the
Kentucky Derby and are trying
to win it back on tennis, we
have established winner-take-all
odds. Last year we did pick
the Generals to win the whole
show, but this time W&L will
certainly have a tougher road
to traverse if it wants to
defend its national champion-
ship.

Here then is an analysis of
the ten teams selected to par-
ticipate in the NCAA D-III
National Men’s Tennis Cham-
pionships.

In this their fifth NCAA
post-season appearance, the Ba-
nana Slugs fugh!] have estab-
lished beyond a doubt that they
are a certified force in Division
III men’s tennis. They have
put together four amazing sea-
sons of play, losing only one
regular season match. The Ba-
nana Slugs are no softies, how-
ever, notching wins this year
over Swarthmore, UCSD,
Emory, Gustavus Adolphus,
and Redlands, who was a tour-
ney regular until several years
ago. ‘‘Our team has had char-
acter all season long,’’ said
head coach Bob Hansen.

“‘We come at people hard
all season long,’’ continued
Hansen. No doubt the ‘Slugs
would relish a match against
W&L, who forced them to
swallow a bitter pill at 11 p.m.
on that rainy Championship
evening in the spring of 1988.

 

A wide open field |
)
|

The Slugs were seeded first in
the '88 Tournament as well.

The charge of the ‘Slug
Brigade will be led by senior
Chad Andrews. Andrews is
ranked 14th by the ITCA.
Chad will be backed by sopho- 4°
more Steve Gottlieb, who the /}>
ITCA placed at the No. 24 po-
sition. Freshman Greg Jarasitis
is No. 49 in the eyes of the
ITCA.

The one chink in the Slugs’
slimy armor: a missing player.
Andrews’ ITCA No. 8 doubles
partner, who was also ranked
27th in singles, had to quit the [°
squad late in the season. The |?
question will be whether or not
the Banana Slugs can fill in

for him? Do they have the +
depth? :
ODDS: 3-1 Sure, the Banana

Slugs have been ranked No. 1
all season, but they held the
same spot last year, too. The
best thing going for this team
is their hard charging, no-holds
barred attack. These Slugs are
also hungry, especially after
coming so close against W&L
(Santa Cruz reached champion-
ship point at one point).
If they can endure three days
of demanding team tennis, they
can win the title. j

SWARTHMORE COLLEGE
Swarthmore, Pennsylvania

TOURNAMENT SEED: 2
ITCA RANKING: 2 (72)

Last year, the Little Quak-
ers were ranked third. At the
end of the 1988 team competi-
tion that is right where they
sat: No. 3. This year, if the
Swarthmore netters don’t want
to stay stoically positioned for
yet another season, they have
only one step up they can |,
make. 1989 Div. Ill wins in-
clude Claremont and W&L. '

Although the Little Quakers «
don’t have a_ singles player
ranked in the top ten, they do
have an alarming depth of °
talent. Junior Andy Mouer ,
shows up as ITCA’s No. 15
player. Mouer is a tall, lean,
well, downright stringy player ¢
who is guaranteed to give his
opponent a tough match, no
matter who it might be. q
