The W&L Spectator was
discussed at a special meeting of
the Executive Committee on
Thursday, April 26, and the
Liberty Hall Volunteers, a
telegram to Chinese student
protestors, the policy for the

distribution of grade change sheets
and missing dining hall utensils
were discussed at the Monday,

May 1 meeting of the EC.
During last Monday’s EC
meeting, sophomores Paul

Lagarde, Ray Welder and Claude
Williams presented plans for the
Spectator, a new _ student
publication. Lagarde, Welder and
Williams are seeking to provide a
forum for "enlightened discourse"

on ideas and issues involving
W&L, as well as on national and
international events. The group
petitionéd the EC for $700 needed
to cover the cost of printing the
first issue, to be released this
month. However, the provisional
approval the Publications Board
granted the Spectator lead the EC
to table the petition. The EC
sought a_ clarification of the
meaning of "provisional approval.”
Normally, the EC releases funds
only after the board has granted
the board an _ unconditional
approval; but the EC can overrule
a board decision and_ release
funds.

The EC reconsidered the
request for funds on April 26.

SPCA seeks larger shelter

Overcrowding forcing animals to be euthanized

 

By Alesha Priebe
Staff Reporter

The Rockbridge Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
has found a possible site for a
new shelter, SPCA chairman Mrs.
Kenneth Cornett said.

A four-acre area of land on
Route 39 near the county jail is
currently being considered for pur-
chase. A $200,000 building has
been proposed to house the stray
and unwanted animals that are
now crowded in the shelter on
Campbell Lane in Lexington.

The current shelter is 25 years
old, too small and is ‘‘falling
apart,” according to Cornett.
During the recent heavy
rainstorms, water poured through a
hole in the roof,

The Best Seller has solved its
space problem.

Beth Thompson, _ the
bookstore’s manager, said, ‘‘We
were just running out of space and
luckily the store next door became
available.”’ But she said, ‘‘It’s
really a little too early to tell’’ if
the expansion into the former Flip
Side music store has helped busi-
ness.

Thompson has _ been the
bookselling business since 1975
when she returned to Rockbridge

The Campbell Lane _ shelter
has nine dog runs, indoor cages
with access to outdoor cages, and
10 cat cages, but the shelter is
currently housing 19 dogs and 23
cats,

Cornett said the small space
causes disease spreading and limits
the amount of time the shelter can
keep an animal before euthanizing
it. Right now, an animal is kept
an average of 5-14 days before it
must be put to sleep. Comett said
20 percent of the animals brought
to the shelter will be adopted.
The other 80 percent are put to
sleep. The Humane Society of the
United States reported that 12 mil-
lion animals end up in shelters
every year. Eight million of those
are euthanized.

The proposed shelter would

have 22 to 25 dog runs and 20
cat cages, allowing more animals
to be housed for a longer period
of time. It would be less noisy
than the Campbell Lane area and
would provide better health condi-
tions for the animals, Cornett said.

During 1988, 1,455 cats and
dogs were brought to the
Rockbridge SPCA shelter. That is
four times the number of animals
brought to the shelter 25 years
ago.

“We simply don’t have the
room for so many animals. That’s
why the new shelter is so impor-
tant to us,’ Cornett said.

Omicron Delta Kappa has
named seven new initiates and
John Fialcowitz will be the recipi-
ent of ODK’s sophomore-of-the-
year award. ,

According to senior Moose
Herring, W&L’s ODK president,
the initiates were named to give
the juniors already inducted a
larger membership body for next
year.

ODK is a national leadership
honor society founded December
3, 1914, at W&L. It was organ-
ized by fifteen student and faculty
leaders in the legacy of the ideal-
ism and leadership of George
Washington and Robert E. Lee.

The new initiates, all juniors,
are George Wesley Boyd, Jennifer
E. Spreng, Tomas Andrew
Brubaker, Kevin M. Nash, Robert
K. Tompkins, Charles Richard
Tomkins, —and= Kara— L,
Cunningham.

Herring said Fialcowitz, of
Garden City, N.Y., was given the
Rupert Nelson Latture award (Lat-
ture was a student founder of
ODK) because ‘‘we recognized
that he is a mover and a shaker.
He started up Live Drive. People
thought that was one of the big-
gest things to come to this univer-
sity in a long time.’’ Fialcowitz
instituted Live Drive with sopho-
mores Chris Bray and Rob Malloy
because he ‘‘thought it was some-

considered the political perspective
of the Spectator. The EC does
not allocate funds to organizations

that support a specific political
interest or idealogy, such as the
College Republicans and __ the
Young Democrats. Lagarde
explained that although the
Spectator’s organizers are
conservative, the magazine will

not necessarily support a specific
political agenda, nor will the
magazine engage in electioncering.
He reminded the committee of
plans to include pieces expressing
opposing views on the same
subject.

Lagarde also described how the

establishment of new — student
publications is impaired by
bureaucratic difficulties.

Currently, organizers must publish

campus and something that could
be improved.”’ He said the idea
came to him when he was return-
ing from a party out at Zollman’s
last spring. Fialcowitz is also the
sophomore class Executive Com-
mittee representative,

Herring said all ODK initiates
must have a junior or senior
standing and are chosen through
a voting process. The ODK hand-
book states that all possible initi-
ates must “‘rank in the highest
thirty-five percent in scholarship
among students in his or her
class.”’ Herring said the members
are given a list of non-members
who are academically eligible to
become members. At this time,
cach eligible student is discussed
and voted on individually based
on his or her character, leadership
and service. Unfortunately, ac-
cording to Herring, ‘‘some of the
people who have contributed most
to the university are not a part of
ODK because of the academic re-
quirement.”

The ODK spring initiation be-,
gan last year. This naming of
new members, according to Her-
ring, is because of ODK’s des.re
to become more service-oriented
and to provide more campus activ-
ities as were provided this year.
The activities Herring named were

OPINION

The North trial —Reclaiming_

Keep your fingers crossed, but the trial of former White
House aide and current W&L Dad Oliver North should be
within days of coming to a close. As we go to press, the
jury is in its twelfth day of deliberations (remember, God
created the world in only six).

To say a resolution to this mess has been long in
coming is an understatement. Unfortunately, the denouement
of this process -- whatever the outcome -- won’t mean as
much as it should. After independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh spent millions investigating the Iran-Contra matter,
he threw out the central charges -- conspiracy to defraud
the U.S. and theft of government property -- rather than
risk forcing the disclosure of classified information.

We considered that turn of events unfortunate, because,
considering last summer’s trial-by-Congress, we thought
North deserved the opportunity to clear his name.

Now, no one seems to know what the impending verdict
will mean. We certainly don’t. And, despite the magnificent
miniseries The Rise and Fall of Oliver North, we're not
sure anybody else does.

Was it worth the millions Walsh spent? Was it worth the
tons of newsprint and days of television air-time that
followed? Was it worth turning the government upside-
down? After all this blood-letting, we still don’t know the
answer to the central questions -- who was aware of and
involved in the diversion of funds when -- and who’s to
say it would have been worth it all if we did?

Of course, there are the impending trials of North’s
colleagues in the Iran-Contra matter. Perhaps those trials
will be more illuminating than North’s -- but don’t bet on
it.

While Walsh and company may be intent on finding out
every detail of the diversion, the rest of us aren’t. Enough
is enough. Let’s hope the jury will send them all home
without any supper -- and thereby lift the sentence the
Washington inquisitors have imposed on the rest of us.

Student wants
librarian tenured

To the Editors:

Spring Term at Washington & Lee means many things to many
people. To seniors, it’s time for ‘‘Popes for Dopes’’ and ‘‘Goshen
and Gondolas’’ or to begin looking for jobs. For undergrads, it’s
time to begin thinking about summer vacation and whether you go
to Barbados or Aspen. It’s time for class work, frizbee on the
Colonnade and parties at Goshen. Spring Term is also when the
faculty decides who gets Tenure and who gets the Boot. This year,
the tenure committee, for reasons unknown, voted against a won-
derful and caring member of the University Library staff, Mrs.
Peggy Hays. I feel, along with a lot of others, that this decision is
WRONG!!!

Mrs. Hays is a competent and dedicated librarian with over
twenty years of experience. She takes an active interest in the lives
of the students and is willing to go to the proverbial ‘‘extra mile”’
to help a student. Indeed, how many faculty members do you
know who will go to the bus station at 3 A.M. to pick up a
student so that they will not have to walk back to campus? I can’t
begin to count the number of times that I have found Mrs. Hays at
work, after hours, looking for that elusive bit of information which
a student has declared as absolutely critical to the survival of their

MY VIEW
By Peter Collier

 

EDITOR'S NOTE: Peter Collier is an au-
thor and former student protestor. His column
appears here courtesy ‘‘Collegiate Times."’

Twenty-five years ago this fall, I was in
school at U.C. Berkeley and helping organize
the Free Speech Movement, one of the open-
ing salvos in the political wars of the "60s.
One aftemoon during a lull in the protest, I
stood up in the middle of a graduate seminar
on James Boswell and began lecturing my
professor, more or less out of the blue, on the
need for a radical consciousness in the class-
room. After I had finished, my professor said
something like this: ‘‘Now that’s all very
interesting, Mr. Collier, and one is certainly
left to wonder what Samuel Johnson would
have thought of such a demand, given his
famous confrontation with John Wilkes. But
then you’re not exactly a John Wilkes, are
you?”’

John Wilkes, I should say, was the flaming
radical of Samuel Johnson’s day, and Johnson,
great Tory that he was, found him a charming
man but also a threat to civilization. At the
time, of course, I identified with Wilkes and
was stung by the suggestion that my radical-
ism was less than his. It’s a measure of how
far I’ve come that I now identify with good
old Sam Johnson, who saw the radicals of his
day as ‘‘unprincipled and destructive scoun-
drels,”’

More to the point, it’s a measure of how
far the university has come that the process
I’ve just described now occurs exactly in re-
verse. No longer is it a case of students try-
ing to intrude radical politics into the class-
room and being politely rebuffed by professors
who take their jobs seriously. Now it’s the
other way around. University officials make
leftism part of the intellectual air students
breathe, and professors are using their rooms
as bully pulpits from which to force correct
political attitudes on the young.

We New Left radicals paid little attention
to conservatives back in the early ’60s. Our
real targets were liberals -- Cold War liberals,
corporate liberals, and most of all the liberals
who formed the vital center in the Democratic
Party, and who had been present at the cre-
ation of the postwar world. We knew that if
we could break their power, we'd change
America forever. And we did. This is one
of the few undisputed truths of the New Left.

But of all the liberal strongholds, the one
we attacked with special venom was the uni-
versity. Why? Because it claimed to sympa-
thize with our frustration, because of its al-
leged ties to the war machine, because it was
the only place we could have an impact, be-
cause it was there.

McCarthyism had scarred the university.
When I first arrived at Berkeley in 1957,
these wounds were still fairly raw. But the
Left’s reign of terror in the 1960s affected the
university far more than the senator from Wis-

Radicals invaded

teaching. Radicals assaulted students who
didn’t agree with them. Radicals set fire to
libraries whose offense was to hold the accu-
mulated wisdom of Western civilization. Rad-
icals bombed buildings where work was al-
legedly being done in support of ‘‘American
fascism.”’

Radicals maimed individual lives and, on
many campuses, brought the business of edu-
cation to a standstill. I know, because I was
one of them. We changed forever -- in a
way old Joe McCarthy, with all his delusions
of grandeur, never would have thought of
doing -- what is taught, and how, and why.
We brought the university to its knees and it’s
remained in that posture ever since.

We need an academic
equivalent of the Reagan
Doctrine -- an effort to roll
back the Left’s successes in
the university.

Yet after Vietnam many of my old com-
rades reentered the university as professors
and administrators. Having failed to change
America in their image in the ’60s, they used
the respite offered by the ‘‘Me Decade’’ to
get on the tenure track. In part, they were
seeking a convalescent home where they could
recover from radical burnout. But they were
also acting on the one lesson they had learned
from the 1960s: To be effective, they would
have to hunker down for the long struggle in
a tolerant environment.

I first saw the effects of their decision late
in the 1970s, when I was teaching at Berkeley
as a visiting writer. By that time, innovations
for the ’60s such as ‘‘ethnic studies’’ had
cheapened the curriculum. By themselves,
however, such excrescences would have been
self-limiting; most students knew that these
courses were trivial and avoided them like the
plague. The problem was the New Left men-
tality that had seeped into the way the univer-
sity saw itself and its central academic disci-
plines. Its proponents were beginning to in-

they were encountering little resistance.

The transformation of the university that

began in the ’60s and accelerated during the

Leftists have created an ambience in which

As a History Major, I know the value of good reference person-

is an outstanding person who makes a real difference to this
school. We pay $10,000 tuition to attend a university which prides
itself, and rightly so, on being one of the best in the nation. It is
only right that we, the student body, have faculty and staff which
exemplify the high standards of Washington & Lee University.
Mrs. Peggy Hays is such a person and to deny her a position,
which I feel she richly deserves, is to make a mockery of those
standards,

MY VIEW
By D. Ross Patterson

 

The wheel has come full circle.
In the beginning, there were
minorities who were discriminated
against. Society (i.e., the courts)
decreed that they should be pro-
tected. Equal opportunity legisla-
tion was instituted with the laud-
able purpose of insuring that all
people regardless of race, sex,
creed or color would be treated
equally. However, this noble pur-
pose has been perverted. Instead
of guaranteeing equal rights to all
people, affirmative action has re-
sulted in the favoring of minority
group members relative to their
white counterparts.

Arguing

MY VIEW
By Mike Shady

 

 

I am confused. I always
thought abortion was a complex
issue -- one in which a clear-cut
solution could not be reached.
Not so, according to the three
opinion columns that appeared in
last week’s Phi. Mr. Bettendorf
argues that ‘‘no one would dare
claim that abortion is in any way
morally good.’’ Miss Heiskell
says ‘“‘no one has the right to de-
ny life.’ And Mr. Cook states
that “‘anyway you look at it, a
life is taken in abortion,”

So I guess this abortion dilem-
ma is pretty easily solved then,
right? No question about it, abor-
tions should be made illegal and
any woman who has one per-
formed and any doctor who per-
forms one should be thrown in jail
for murder. Case closed.

But it’s not that simple, is it?
I want to present a hypothetical
situation to Mr. Bettendorf. What

A recent article by Paul Rob-
erts appearing in The Richmond
Times-Dispatch discusses Michigan
State University’s affirmative ac-
tion policy. “After MSU students
complete the core course require-

action secks equality but an equal-
ity reminiscent of George Orwell’s
Animal Farm in which all animals
are created equal, but some are
more equal than others.

such as engineering and education.
In the admission formulas that are

blacks, Asians, Hispanics, and na-

race. This policy of affirmative

if your mother were raped and be-
came pregnant? And what if hav-
ing that child would endanger the
life of your mother, as well as the
child’s? Should she be forced to
carry the child to full term? Your
article seems to suggest so.
Wouldn’t abortion in this hypothe-
tical case be justified on ethical
grounds, or at least in an ethical
context?

discrimination based on race, but
Michigan State’s policy goes too
far in the pursuit of affirmative
action. To quote Roberts, "Racial
groups now have entitlement to
their share of college degrees
whether they earn them or not."
Policies similar to this one are un-
fair to all parties involved. White

students are prevented from attain-
ing admission to the schools they
deserve; deserving minority stu-
dents’ achievements are cheapened
by prevailing attitudes that these
achievements are the result of spe-
cial treatment and not hard work.
Quotas and special standards to
insure "proper" ratios of minorities
to whites in organizations, whether
they be colleges or businesses, are
unfair to everyone. Equal oppor-
tunity should mean exactly that:

has to bear the incredible burden
of carrying a child for nine
months. Doesn’t seem fair or
*just’’ to me.

The typical rebuttal to the rape
problem along with incest is to
say, ‘‘Okay, we'll make except-
ions for rape and incest,’’ which
our current president has said on
several occasions. This is absurd.

 

What about the rights

of a rape victim who

becomes pregnant? Is she responsible for
bearing that child? Saying “tough break” is

not the answer.

 

As for Miss Heiskell’s beliefs,
the rape situation applies here as
well. What about the woman’s
rights in this predicament? A
child that she had no intention of
having is now inside of her body.
Is she responsible, and if so, why
should she be? She did not ask
to be raped. Mr. Bettendorf wants
‘justice’ but I find it hard to ac-
cept that justice is served if a rape

for no loopholes or exceptions,
but, while their reasoning is con-
sistent, it does not say what is the
“‘right’’ thing to do in the situa-
tions of rape and incest,

Here’s yet another scenario: a
pregnant woman discovers after
medical tests that the child she is

carrying will be born mentally re-
tarded. The financial consider-
ations (special medical and school
bills) aside, is everyone emotional-
ly ready or willing to be the
mother or father of a_ retarded
child? What kind of ‘“‘life’’ does

a mentally handicapped person '

Is it a
I’m _ not

have in today’s soviety?
‘life’ worth having?

saying a potentially retarded child °
should be aborted, but isn’t this «
yet another difficult decision that —

must be rendered?

What I find disturbing with the
views presented last week is the
limiting stance they take toward
abortion, All three attempt to
strip the issue down to one basic

fact: an unbom child has the right ‘

to life. What none of these opin-

ions examines are the rights of the _

woman involved. There are many
moral dilemmas in

which the °

rights of one person conflict with ,

the rights of another, and abortion
is one of these problems.

Saying °

‘*tough break’ to a raped woman ,

who becomes pregnant is not the
answer.

Despite EC’s denial,

the Spectator will hit the
Colonnade this month, as planned.
Lagarde said that expenses are

being personally covered by
magazine organizers, who hope to
be reimbursed with funds collected
from alumni.

Also at Monday’s meeting, the
Liberty Hall Volunteers described
their activities and petitioned the
EC for additional funds. President
David Burns described how the
Volunteers done vintage Civil War
uniforms and use equipment of
that cra to promote an
understanding of the war and an
appreciation of the role of the
soldiers. Burns said that this
spring, the Volunteers will join
VMI cadets and area residents in
a reenactment of the Battle of
New Market. At that battle,
cadets joined Confederate forces to
defend this area from the invading
Union Army. The event. will be
filmed and a movie will be
produced for VMI’s New Market

Museum. _ Wal -wile he
mentioned in the credits and

Burns said that muscum curators
estimate that the film be shown
for the next 50 years.

Bums led the group’s petition
for funds. He requested
reimbursement to cover the cost of
programs for last October’s Lee
memorial — service. Burns
requested money to — purchase
canteens and blankets for the New
Market reenactment. EC President
Christopher de Movellan said that
the group clearly engages in
worthwhile activities; however, he
suggested that the Student Activity
Board’s current debt should be
considered. EC Vice President
Hugh Finkelstein reported that the
SAB is approximately $10,000 -
$15,000 in debt. In addition, de
Movellan cited that the group was
granted $1000 earlier this year, a
substantial amount in consideration
of the small number of students
involved and their limited number
of activilics.

Burns said that the Voluntgers
perform a_ school service by
promoting W&L’s reputation, The
Volunteers are casing the tension
between W&L students and local
groups through overnight camps
and daytime marches with these
groups. Burns especially noted
that the Volunteers are one of the
few organizations at W&L that
interacts with VMI cadets. He

felt. that recent activitics with
cadets led the participants to
resolve some of the rivalry

between men at W&L and VMI.
The EC voted to allocate $104.05
to the Volunteers for the purchase
of canteens.

In other EC business, members
concurred with  Finkelstein’s
opinion that a telegram from
students at W&L to students in
the People’s Republic of China
would be appropriate. The
Chinese students are demanding
freedoms promoted by George
Washington, a founder of U.S., as
well as an early supporter of
W&L.

Sophomore _ Representative
Willard Dumas reported on a
professor’s request — that the
committee review the current
policy for the distribution of grade
change sheets. Grade change
sheets are not released directly to
Students. Dumas _ said that
according to Registrar Scott
Dittman, the policy blocks the
temptation to forge a_professor’s
signature and commit an_ honor
violation. The professor believes
that the policy may be unfairly
questioning the honor of students.
Discussion on the matter was
postponed until next week’s
meeting. Junior Representative
Brandon Canaday reported on the
theft of utensils and dishes from
Evan’s Dining Hall. Since the
fall term, approximately 200 cups
liave disappeared from Evans.
Evans managers requested that de
Movellan write ¢ short note to

remind students that the theft of
Evans utensils and dishes is an
honor violation and consequently
punishable by expulsion.

Chi Os initiate

 

By Cullins Carriker
Staff Reporter

"In a couple of years our
new sorority system will be fully
integrated into fraternity and
campus life and we can all look
back proudly because we are
charter members of the system
and our own special Chi Omega
Chapter, the first installed sorority
on campus," stated Keri Hinrichs,

senior president of the Chi Omega
colony at Washington and Lee
University.

The installation of the Xi
Lambda Chapter of Chi Omega
onto the W&L campus was held
on Satruday April 29, 1989 at
Southem Seminary College in
Buena Vista, Virginia. The
installing chapter was the Lambda
Gamma Chapter of the University
of Virginia at Charlottesville.

 

ODK

(continued from page 1)

#e also said ODK provided a stu-
dent seminar on leadership style
that brought in a professor from
Virginia Polytechnic _Institute.
Yesterday a leadership program
was provided at Lexington High
School with Norm Lord, professor
of Physical Education. Herring
said there was an ODK luncheon
twice a month to discuss various
school affairs. He said the pro-
grams ODK provided this year
were a result of those luncheons.

SPCA

 

 

One of the main reasons for these
new programs, according to Her-
ring, was ‘‘we’re trying to become
more than just an honorary soci-
ety.”’ Herring said ODK has been
thought of in the past as being an
inactive society with the potential
to be very active and effective
around the W&L community. He
said this inactiveness made several
non-members of ODK view the
society in a negative manner.

The new members will be offi-
cially ‘‘tapped,’’ or inducted, in
January of 1990. Next year’s of-
ficers are J. Wayne Burris, Presi-
dent, and Shawn Copeland, Vice
President.

occurs, Cornett said, agreeing with
HSUS. The SPCA requires that
all animals adopted from the shel-
ter be spayed within a specified
period of time. Court action is
brought against people who do not
comply.

In order to begin building a
new shelter, the SPCA needs ap-
proval from the HSUS in Wash-
ington and the state veterinarian in
Richmond. Funds for the
proposed shelter must be obtained
completely through donations. A
large fund raising campaign will
begin once land is purchased,
Cornett said.

Wilma Lester, a member of
the SPCA board, expressed: the
urgency of the goal in the group’s
spring newsletter. ‘“‘This time of
year brings home our critical need
for a new and larger Animal Shel-
ter so that we can take care of

As far as which books sell,
Thompson said that local history
books are on everyone’s shopping
list, but beyond that, it depends on
the season and what’s ‘‘hot’’ at
the time. She said during Christ-
mas, All I Really to Know I
Learned In Kindergarten, a book
on psychology by Dr. Robert
Fulghum, received a lot of atten-
tion.

Looking over the _ birch
Plywood shelves in the
comfortable store, one notices that
there are no magazines or newspa-
pers to purchase. Thompson ex-
plained, ‘‘I’ve tried stocking mag-
azines and newspapers in the past,
but people could easily buy them
elsewhere, or they would buy one
issue and subscribe. So, I lost
money on them. However, we
still sell the Sunday edition of the
New York Times.”’

She added, ‘‘I think Lexington
would be a good place for a real
good newsstand.”

The Best Seller’s book selec-
tion covers everything from diet-
ing to art. Humpty Dumpty, in the
company of a troop of stuffed ani-
mals, smiles from the cover of a
book on one beige shelf, and Lee

Robertson and Shirley MacLaine,
smiles from another shelf.

Although the Best Seller is
still small in comparison to large
chains like B. Dalton’s' or
Waldenbooks, its size is compen-
sated by its operators’ willingness
to serve.

Sbar Speaks:

Sbar becomes born

 

By Jon Sbar

As a young drug-crazed jour-
nalist at Plant High School, I was
known as a writer who could go
too far. In one article, for exam-
ple, I detailed a hypothetical sexu-
al encounter between two guidance
counselors and my elderly physics
teacher (I’m still paying off the
libel settlement). However my
days of lunatic journalism are long
gone. Thanks to a sudden religious
experience I became a born again
Christian-Jewish-Moslem-Buddhist
writer. Now that I maintain such
high ethical standards, occasionally
I am forced to overlook some hig-
hly interesting material. Take the
case of my late night naked kitch-
en stalking housemate. What an
article it would make if I was
able to tell readers, in intricate
detail, about certain individuals I
live with who grew up with the
notion that its okay to walk down
the hall to the kitchen butt naked
to eat cheese nachos provided that
it’s between the hours of 2:00 and
5:00 A.M. But as a Born Again
Journalist how could I? It would-
n't be ethical; anyone with deter-
mination, natural investigative sk-
ills has instant access to the
names and home addresses of my
housemates. So instead of late
night nudity I will discuss Albert
"the animal" Einstein, the great
scientist (and butterfly collector)
who discovered the major ele-
ments (earth, wind, air and fire)
using only a tool kit and a box of
matches,

The night after discovering the
elements Einstein was chain smok-
ing unfiltered Camel Cigarettes,
drinking Old Milwaukee beer and
listening to rap music when it oc-
curred to him that all matter in

 

the universe, even his dog Elec-
tron, are moving towards a state
of chaos. What this meant in sci-
entific terms is that Einstein now
had a good excuse for not clean-
ing up the garage.

Ethelda (Einstein’s wife): ‘‘Al-
bert, I don’t give a damn if you
did win the Nobel Prize, if that
garage is not clean by tomorrow
I’m taking your favorite calculator
to the pawn shop.”’

Einstein (in his rural dialect):
‘But garsh darn it Ethelda clean-
ing up the garage is a waste of
time. Clean or dirty the garage’ ll
still be headed for a state of cha-
Oh

That next day, while cleaning
out the garage, Einstein discovered
that garage mattcr could not be
created or destroyed unless you
hauled it to the dumpster.

Since we’re already on the sub-
ject of great intellectuals now
would be the best time for me to
discuss Donna Rice and her winter
visit to Washington and Lee Uni-
versity for an ethics seminar (that
same weekend Ghandi was in Le-
xington for a handgun combat se-
minar). It seems that the visiting
Donna Rice was not the peroxide
blonde, breast implanted opportun-
ist you might have read about in
the papers.

The real Donna Rice is Donna
"Robin Hood" Rice, a former
Kool-Aid drinking girl scout who
worked her way through college
and astrophysics graduate school.
The real Donna Rice travels a-
round, disguised by buck teeth and
shaved head, stealing from the
rich and giving to the poor. Thou-
gh I would like nothing better
than to tell you about Donna and
her band of ‘‘Merry Bandits’,
which incidentally includes Mother
Theresa, some thing deep inside of

again?

my body (my large intestine) is
motivating me to move on to the
complex subject of Dade County
resident, Peggy Fields. |

Fields, who was blinded after
being struck by a flying roll of
toilet paper, is living proof of that
prehistoric cliche,‘‘It’s only fun
until someone loses an eye.’’ Ac-
cording to the Tampa Tribune, the
“roll of toilet paper sailed 60 feet
through the air and hit her behind
the left ear.’

Ry this time readers are proba-
bly wondering why this article, in
total disregard for the laws of or-
ganization, is jumping from topic
to topic, from Born Again Journal-
ism to naked kitchen stalkers,
from naked kitchen stalkers to Al-
bert Einstein, from Albert Einstein
to Donna Rice and from Donna
Rice to Peggy Fields. Although I
would love to tell you why I must
end this article immediaiely. You
see, I’m late for a Donna Rice
seminar on Born Again Jcurnalism
and I promised my good friend
Albert Einstein that I'd give him a
ride, Besides, the naked kitchen
stalker is probably gearing up (I
mean down) for a late night sna-
ck.

Buchanan finishing final semester

 

By Mitchell Schmale
Staff Reporter

 

William Buchanan walks with
a cane into his office in the
School of Commerce, Economics
and Politics, snaps off the dark
sunshades covering his glasses,
which he must wear due to recent
cataract surgery, and sits at his
cluttered desk to look over his ap-
pointments for the day. The
70-year-old politics professor takes
his time because his 23-year
career at Washington and Lee is
drawing to a close. This is his last
spring semester.

‘“‘Time is what I have plenty
of,’’ said Buchanan.

Buchanan = graduated ~_— from
Washington and Lee in 1941 with
a certificate in journalism, a major
in French and a_ masters in
English. He accomplished this un-
der a different system that existed
at Washington and Lee up until
the 1940’s.

He said his proudest and most
rewarding experience as an under-
graduate was serving as the senior
editor of the Ring-tum Phi.

Following graduation, Buchan-

an worked on a newspaper in
Lynchburg and then joined the
Navy as a communications officer.
He served from 1942 to 1946 in
South America and Europe decod-
ing and untangling messages.

After World War II Buchanan
taught English and journalism at
Roanoke College for one year un-
til 1947, He then returned to
W&L for two years to work on
the Washington and Lee bicenten-
nial anniversary and teach one
class in journalism.

In 1949, Buchanan went to
graduate school at Princeton Uni-
versity, receiving his Ph.D in 19-
55. He taught political science in
Mississippi, California and Tennes-
see before returning to W&L in
1966.

“IT was glad to have the op-
portunity to come back,”’ said Bu-
chanan, who is famous for his Re-
search Methods class.

Senior Jamie Gaucher, a polit-
ical science major, describes
Buchanan’s teaching methods as
“‘hard, but fair.’’

Buchanan is a member of the
American Political Science Associ-
ation and was the chairman of its

Panel of Review from 1968 to
1969. He has also written two
books including, ‘‘Understanding
Political Variables’ and has co-a-
uthored three other books on poli-
tics.

The politics professor is a
regular contributor of articles to
many political science journals, is
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and
was the Visiting Fellow at Oxford
in the Winter of 1983.

“‘Washington and Lee gave
me a very good education,’’ said
Buchanan, who places much im-
portance on knowledge and a good
education.

“Teaching is something you
do from day to day and it is re-
warding,’’ said Buchanan, ‘“‘I’ve
taught quite a number of people.”’

When asked why he’s retiring,
Buchanan laughs and says, ‘‘Be-
cause I’m 70.”’

He said his plans for the fu-
ture are not definite yet, but he
plans to spend his time relaxing
and enjoying himself. He is cur-
rently auditing a freshman chemis-
try course.

Edward C. Atwood Jr., profes-
sor of economics and the former
dean of the School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics, said Bu-
chanan has been a ‘“‘great asset to
Washington and Lee.”’

“‘We were very lucky to get
him. He and his wife have been a
great asset to the community,”’
said Atwood.

“But, I wish he were younger
so he wouldn’t have to retire,”’
Atwood said with a smile.

W&L upsets VMI in Lee-Jackson game

Men’s tennis
Slips past
‘Emory, 5-4

' By Stu Sheldon
| Staff Reporter

 

 

The Mens’ Tennis team seems
fo have a trip to _— scenic
Kalamazoo, Michigan, in their
future. Currently tied for fourth
‘in the nation, Washington & Lee’s
§tringmen are certain to have yet
another bid to the NCAA Division
III National Championships in the
bag.

Earlier
Intercollegiate
Association (ITCA) had the
‘Generals sharing the fourth
; position with Kalamazoo College,
-who will host the tournament.
Season-long favorite University of
California-Santa Cruz remains at
Number one.

If W&L receives a tournament
‘bid from the selection committee
this Sunday, it will be their fifth
Straight trip to the D-III National
Championships.

* The Generals brought — their
season record to 8-9 last Saturday
“by beating Emory University, 5-4.

the
Coaches

this week,
Tennis

The match was played at
Davidson, in North Carolina, to
prevent either team from making
an eight-hour drive. Because of
“weather conditions, the contest
‘was moved indoors after half an
“hour of play.

. ‘‘Emory was quite a shocker,”
Said sophomore Bill Meadows,
‘whose win at No. 2 doubles with
‘senior partner Robert Haley
clinched the team victory. Emory
sends into battle a young, yet
talented, team. ‘‘Their No.
player is only a sophomore,”
Meadows continued, ‘‘and four of
their top six are freshmen.”’

Three-set matches were the
order of the day on Saturday, with
six of the nine skirmishes going
the distance. ‘With six three-
setters, it could have easily been
‘7-2 either way,’’ said W&L Head
,Coach Gary Franke.

The most exciting of these
six showdowns, for the Blue and
White, was at the No. 3 position.
W&L’s Haley was down 5-3 in
the third and raged back to force
the deciding set into a tie-breaker.
After falling behind 0-2 in the
"breaker, Haley poured on_ the
steam and shut down his
Opponent, winning the ’breaker 7-
3, and the matci..

Other winners for the Generals
were senior John Morris (15-5) at
No. 1, classmate Bobby Matthews
(17-3) at No. 2, and junior Billy
Tunner (9-3) at the No. 6 spot.

In doubles action, W&L’s only

It was a familiar face opposing
the Washington and Lee baseball
team on Monday in the semifinals
of the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference tournament. In fact, it
was the same face who, earlier in
the year, on a_ basketball court,

opposed the Generals in the
ODAC Tournament finals.
Hampden-Sydney’s Ralph

Baker got the call to pitch against
the Generals on Monday, and just
as he did during basketball season,
he ended W&L’s season by
pitching the Tigers to a 7-1 win
over the Generals in Hampden-
Sydney,

WAL scored first off Baker in
the first inning, when senior center
fielder Tom Skeen singled home
senior shortstop Harry Halpert to
give the Generals a 1-0 lead.
Hampden-Sydney tied the game
off W&L starter Mike Temple,
who was the starter when W&L

The game stayed tied until the
bottom of the fifth, when H-SC
scored twice to take the lead for
good, touching Temple for the
first of two two-run homers on the
day. The Tigers struck again in
the sixth, with another homer,
finishing Temple for the day.

Steve Momorella, a freshman
who emerged as the ace of the
W&L staff, came on in_ the
seventh and didn’t fare much
better, allowing two runs as the
Tigers moved out to a 7-1 lead.

The secret of W&L’s success
throughout the season had been
the timely hitting of seniors Eddie

Klank, Tony Waskiewicz,
Halpert, Skeen and junior Rich
Grace. Baker and one relief
pitcher held the heart of the

Generals order to a combined 4-20
on the day. Klank and Grace,
hitting .370 and .420 coming into
the game, both went 0-4. Tim
Wheeler had two hits for the
Generals.

The Generals also hit into four
double plays on the day aiding the
Tigers’ cause.

For the season, the Generals

Wiemi scores winner in OT

 

By Jay Plotkin
Assistant Sports Editor

 

In a way, the Washington and
Lee men’s. lacrosse team
underwent a passing of the torch
last Saturday in the second annual
Lee-Jackson Classic.

On attack, the torch was
passed from senior two-time All-
American John Ware to freshman
Wiemi Douoguih, and that passing
resulted in W&L’s most exciting
win in some time.

The Generals scored late in the
game to send it into overtime
before defeating the Keydets 10-9
on VMI’s) Alumni Memorial
Stadium.

In what W&L called their
version of the NCAA tournament,
the Generals jumped out early,
running to a 6-2 lead with 9:17
left in the second quarter. After
VMI opened the scoring, Ware
tied the game with 10:54 left in
the opening period. Fifty-one
seconds later, Ware found
Douoguih open, and the freshman
converted for the first of his four
goals on the day.

Sophomore Todd Garliss made
his presence felt early on as well,
scoring with 8:58 left off a feed
from classmate Mike Moseman.
After VMI scored to cut the lead
to 3-2, Garliss scored again off
Ware’s second assist of the game
to open the second quarter.

After a W&L time out,
Douoguih scored again, unassisted,
to make it 5-2, and Ware followed
that goal with his second of the
day to make it 6-2.

The Keydets then went to work
behind Tim Nolan. Nolan tallied
two goals, including one with :03
left in the half, and an assist to
bring the game to a 6-6 tie at
halftime. Dave Hope also scored
twice in the first half for VMI.

The six goal outburst for W&L
doubled the team’s average output
in its last three games, all losses.

The scoring continued for
W&L when Moseman scored the
lone third quarter goal to give the
Generals a 7-6 lead. But VMI
was equal to the task, and when
Nolan scored his third goal of the
game with 12:30 left in regulation,
the Keydets had their first lead at
8-7.

Things looked grim for W&L,
as they had not played well this
season with their backs to the
wall, but Andy Guida, yet another
sophomore, scored his lone goal
of the season to even the game at
8-8 with 7:30 left.

With 2:32 left, VMI’s William
Coleman put the Generals one
step closer to another defeat with

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee
women’s lacrosse team closed
its first year as a varsity sport
with an impressive showing in
the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference Tournament,
reaching the semifinals and
playing its best lacrosse of the

year.

The W&L women, 7-8 for
the year, opened tournament
play on Wednesday with a
quarterfinal game with Hollins.
Hollins had defeated W&L 5-4
in Lexington earlier this year,
but the Generals rallied to win
7-5 at Hollins.

The win moved _ the
Generals into the semifinals on
Friday, where they faced No. 2
seed Roanoke College.
Roanoke had defeated W&L
by a 16-8 count earlier this
year, but this game would be a

his second goal of the game, but
Douoguih made it clear that W&L
would not come up short again.
With 2:00 left, he registered his
first NCAA hat-trick with the goal
that put the game into overtime
tied at 9-9.

In the overtime period,
Generals head coach Dennis Daly

had junior Chris Kennedy face off*

in the place of regular face off
man Stu Geisel, a senior in his
last game. Kennedy won the
draw to start the overtime, and the
Generals never lost possession of
the ball.

After a time out, the Generals
came out with a play designed for
Ware, but when he wasn’t open,
the ball found its way into the
stick of Douoguih. The freshman
wasted no ume in ending the
game, and he beat his defenseman
and scored his fourth goal of the

game, giving the Generals a
thrilling 10-9 season ending
victory over VMI.

Said Douoguih, ‘‘I wasn’t
surprised that I got the ball
because during the time out,
Coach [Daly] told us that if

Johnny [Ware] wasn’t open, that I
should get the ball and try to go
to the goal. Once I got the ball, I
was determined to go to the goal,
and I felt pretty confident that I
could because I had just beaten
the guy guarding me a_ few
minutes earlier.”’

“It’s about time,’’ said Ware,
who finished his career tied for
sixth on W&L’s all-time scoring
list. ‘‘This was our version of the
NCAA tournament.”’

Said Daly, ‘I think what I'll
remember from this game--the
way we came back. We scored
more goals in the first half than
we'd scored in some of our games
lately, but they [VMI] had to have
the momentum going into the
locker room,”’

W&L, 4-9, will return five of
its top six scorers next season.
Moseman leads the returning
players with 15 points (5 goals, 10
assists), followed by sophomores
Garliss (10,3), Brian Overbeck
(4,5), Douoguih (8,0) and junior
Chris Mastrogiovanni (7,0).
Douoguih, whose four goals were
the most by a W&L_ freshman
since Neil Redfern scored four in
a 28-1 win over Va. Tech in
1986, scored all eight of his goals
in the last four games.

“We had some tough losses
and people were getting down,”
said Douoguih. ‘‘The win came
at a good time for the team, It
picked everybody up, being that it
came at the end of the season and

different story. The Generals

‘The Icarus Agenda’- a superthriller

 

 

By Chris Swann
Staff Reporter

 

The megathriller writer Robert
Ludlum has done it again with his
latest bestseller The Icarus Agen-
da. From Southwest Asia to Colo-
rado, Virginia to the Pacific Oce-
an, Mr. Ludlum weaves a tale of
violence and betrayal, intrigue and
passion guaranteed to capture the
attention of audiences agound the
world as the author instills fear
into the reader with the possibility
that his fiction could indeed be
fact.

A key part of Mr. Ludlum’s
style is his ability to describe a
situation authentically, getting the
"nuts and bolts" of the story cor-
rect, as did Ian Fleming with his
James Bond series. He seems to
have a knowlege of the intelli-
gence community that could only
belong to a secret agent. In The
Osterman Weekend, for example,
he writes of the Central Intelli-
gence Agency running a domestic
operation, an act clearly specified
as illegal in that agency’s charter.

This "fictional" story shocked rea-
ders at the time. Later of course,
that "fiction" was revealed to be
fact in several cases. However,
Robert Ludlum was never a spy
or a secret agent. He spent nearly
twenly years in show business as
an actor, producer and the voice
of several television commercials.
He draws heavily on his experi-
ence as an entertainer to write his
novels, creating labyrinthine situa-
tions designed to draw his readers
into his works, and as he admits
in an interview in the back of The
Parsifal Mosaic, “1 write primarily
as an entertainer." However, Lud-
lum also writes from a point of
view other than pure entertain-
ment. "I admit to being out-
raged -- mostly by the abuse of
power by the fanatics. The ex-
tremes bother me, right of left."
He also adds, "I disapprove of vi-
olence, that’s why I show pain for
what it is. When my characters
get his, they hurt. They don’t
jump back into action like John
Wayne."

These ‘‘points of view’’ are

Clearly present in The Icarus Age-
nda, which starts out with a cur-
rent worldwide horror - terrorism.
Dozens of American hostages are
being held in Masqat, Oman by
crazed fanatics who demand im-
possible requests. The only form
of help comes from a United Sta-
les congressman, Evan Kendrick,
who believes his extensive conta-
cts in the area and his understand-
ing of the Arab mind can help
shut down the crisis. Morally out-
raged, Kendrick wants total ano-
nymity, refusing to take any credit
for his actions and seeking no po-
litical mileage. Ludlum _ propels
Kendrick, and the reader, into a

shadow world of espionage and‘

death that leaves Kendrick shaken
to the core. The author’s accurate
use of the exotic Arabic back-
ground further interests the reader
and shocks him as well. The crisis
over, Kendrick returns to his home
in Colorado, determined to remain
nameless and wanting only to fin-
ish his political term in order to
return to his private life.

One year later, the true story of

The Ring-tum Phi, May 4, 1989

Oman is revealed. Kendrick’s role
in Masgat and photographs of the
maverick congressman ar2 printed
on newspapers worldwide. Almost
immediately, Kendrick is thrown
back into a world of violence and
betrayal, facing enraged Arab fa-
natics determined to destroy the
congressman, finding corruption at

the highest levels of government, °

and realizing the existence of a
secret "government within a gov-
ernment" with its own agenda for
Kendrick - the Icarus agenda.

This Ludlum creation has spa-
wned some of the most intense
and living characters of ludlum’s
career: Evan Kendrick, a politician
disgusted by the corruption around
him who seeks only the truth;
Manny Weingrass, the irascible
old Jewish architect whose gruff,
obnoxious exterior cannot hide his
fatherly love for Kendrick; the be-
autiful and mysterious Khalehla, a
cold and experienced CIA field
agent with a very human heart
that is touched by Kendrick’s de-
cency; Frank Swann (no relation
to this writer), the overworked yet

GN’R’s Lies:‘A musically diverse gem

 

By Charlie Gay
Staff Reporter

 

It’s not often that a heavy met-
al/nard rock debut stays on the
charts for 58 weeks, but Guns N’
Roses’ Appetite for Destruction LP
has done exactly that. The band’s
follow-up, GN'R Lies, is also do-
ing well.

As of March 16, Appetite was
firmly entrenched in the number
four slot on the Rolling Stone LP
chart, while Lies was hot on its
predecessor’s heels at number five.
The band’s more recent offering,
dismissed by its creators as some-
thing to tide fans over, is actually
a musically diverse gem, revealing
Guns N’ Roses as no less than an
80’s-90’s Led Zeppelin.

The first half of Lies is actual-
ly a repackaging of the 1986 inde-
pendent release Live Like a Sui-
cide. Bassist Duff McKagan ex-
plained he had seen copies of the
EP for $150, and its inclusion on
Lies was the band’s little favor to
its fans. The four songs were, as
the EP’s title suggests, recorded in
concert and, though rough, are
also fairly melodic. The album
begins with an unintelligible stre-
am of curse words, followed by
the heavy "Reckless Life" and
"Nice Boys". (Incidentally, those
overly offended by obscenities be-
ginning with "f" and the like are
to avoid this work at all costs.)

and Henry streets in downtown
Lexington.

Albert C. Gordon, head of the
WAL fine arts department, directs
the all-student cast. Monica Burke,
senior drama major, will play Au-
drey, the ditzy shop girl who cap-
tures the heart of social misfit
Seymour, who will be portrayed
by Michael Carroll.

Audrey II, the "mean green
mother from outer space," is being
created by W&L’s Total Theatre
class. The plant will actually be
five plants which range in size
from six inches to eight feet. The
larger plants will be controlled
from the inside by Willie Hender-
son. Audrey II’s singing, wheedl-
ing voice will come from Michael
Tuggle.

Both songs are fairly standard, yet
spirited, hard rock with "Nice
Boys" expressing the underlying
ethos: "Nice boys don’t play rock
n’ roll -- I’m not a nice boy.”

Next is the funkier Aerosmith-
influenced "Move to the City",
which is fine, but drags slightly.
The live half of the LP would be
good, but not especially inspiring,
if not for its superb finale -- an
excellent reading of the Aerosmith
classic "Mama Kim". Here the
sound is somewhat tighter and the
metai flows energetically behind
the confident vocals of Axl Rose.
Do yourself a favor and play this
at a loud volume during a party
(before midnight in Lexington, of
course). It’s worth the price of
the record/tape/CD by itself.

The live half of Lies is good,
but if the entire album were like
it, it would be merely a decent
metal release. However, the sec-
ond half consists of four brilliant
acoustic songs, which put forth a
claim for Guns N’ Roses as a
successor to Zeppelin’s career re-
call that the quasi-metallic smash
Led Zeppelin II was followed up
by the experimental L.Z. Jil,
which featured hard rock gems
like "The Immigrant Song," along
with the classic acoustic tune
“Tangerine.” The acoustic work
really allows the superior mus-
icianship of GN’R= to _ shine
through as they prove themselves
to be more than "just" a metal
band.

Gordon, sorting through a pite
ot costumes on the third floor of
DuPont Hall, said “Little Shop of
Horrors" is "the most technically
complicated show" he has directed
at W&L. Gordon cited the five
versions of Audrey II, the func-
tional dentist’s chair, and the cha-
nge of the Skid Row flower shop
into a bright, modern, booming
business as technical difficulties
being handled by the "Total The-
atre" class.

The sadistic dentist, Orin Scriv-
ello, will be played by Scott Bell,
and the role of Mr. Mushnik, the
Jewish florist, will be played by
Todd Peppers. Karen Washington,
Courtney Harpold and Margaret
Pimblett will comprise the ethnic
doo-wop trio of Ronnette, Crystal

The nearly six-minute long bal-
lad "Patience" heralds the transi-
tion of Lies from lion to lamb.
The absence of drums in the song
lends to it a haunting quality that
its comrades share to a greater or
lesser degree. "Patience" is a tes-
tament to the superlative guitar
skills of slash (you know, like St-
ing, Edge, et al), whose intricate
work expresses a wistful and al-
most countrified flavor. "Sad wo-
man, take it slow and it'll work
itself out fine/All we need is just
a little patience," Rose sings. The
song seemingly ends after about 4
1/2 minutes, only to slip into a
confessional coda: "I been walking
the streets at night, just trying to
get it right/Hard to see with so
many around, no, I don’t like get-
ting stuck in the ground...‘cause I
need you."

The next two compositions are
more or less tongue-in-cheek, and
quite enjoyable. Axl, Slash, Duff,
and company call the first of the
two "Used to Love Her" "a joke,
nothing more" on the outside cov-
er, and one listen to the lyrics
makes it clear why at first listen:
"I used to love her, but I had to
kill her/l had to put her six feet
under, and I can still hear her
complain." “You’re Crazy" may
sound a bit familiar, this is be-
cause it appeared on Appetite in a
metallic rendition. According to
the band, the acoustic version is
the original, and its blues-y feel
and condescending vocals justify

and Chiffon.

People who come expecting a
traditional Broadway musical will
be disappointed," said Peppers.
"It’s definitely not Rogers and Ha-
mmerstein!"

"The music is infectious," Gor-
don said. "You certainly won’t get
tired of it."

The production of "Little Shop
of Horrors" pzomises to be a pop-
ular one -- opening night is almost
sold out already, according to Go-
rdon, who also said it is unusual
for a W&L production to get so
many reservations so early.

For reservations, call the Henry
Street Playhouse box office, 463-
8637, from 10 a.m. io 5 p.m. Mo-
nday through Friday.

the second recording. Both songs
feature drums, which helps give
them a fun sound, as opposed to
the more serious acoustic book-
ends.

Lies concludes with the master-
piece "One in a Million", an un-
compromising comment on anony-
mous white boy angsi. The song
begins with a carefree acoustic riff
(complemented by whistling), but
quickly tums dark by introducing
morroccos and a menacing sound-
ing electric rhythm acoustic guitar.
Another musical highlight is SI-
ash’s Spanish-flavored solo about
two-thirds of the way through.
As far as the subject matter goes,
the band explains, it is best on the
album cover:

“Ever been unjustly hassled by
someone with a gun and a badge-
..been tO a convenience store and
treated like you don’: belong here
by an individual who can barely
speak English? Hopefully not, but
have you ever been attacked by a
homosexual? Had some so-called
religionist try to con you out of
your hard-eamed cash? This song
is extremely simple...my apologies
to those who may take offense.”’

Clearly, Guns N’ Roses is a
widely talented band, musically
and lyrically, as the supposed
"snack", GN'R Lies, attests. It re-
mains to be seen whether they
will go on to fully realize their
immense promise, or mercly burn
out on the fast lane of rock n’
roll.
