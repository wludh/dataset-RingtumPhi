Lee service held

 

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

_ _ The twelfth of October was the
118th anniversary of the passing of the
General-in-Chief of the CSA and the
fc.mer president of Washington and
Lee University, Robert Edward Lee.
A memorial service honoring the me-
nidity of Lee and his many contribu-
tons was held at noon in Lee Chapel.

The Liberty Hall Volunteers mar-
ched into the chapel at noon to the toll-
ing of the passing bell, and the cere-
mony commenced. The invocation
was delivered by Dr. Louis Hodges,
the university chaplain, and introduc-
tory remarks concerning the great
effort which has gone into planning
and preparation for the service,- were
given by Capt. Robert C. Peniston.
Southern Comfort then sang ‘*Dixie,””
which, in the solemnity of the chapel,

. was both beautiful and haunting.

Dr. Taylor Sanders, the university
historian, was the speaker for the ser-

‘ vice. He captivated the audience with

his fable of a meeting with General
Lee several months ago. He went on
to relate just how Lee would have felt

‘ about the university today.

New visitation and drinking
policies at Boston University may set
a precedent at other colleges and uni-
versities across the nation. Since the
new restrictions would sharply limit
student autonomy, perhaps the
policies themselves should be more
closely examined.

BU’s new alcohol policy limits the
amount of alcohol in the dorms to a
six-pack of beer or one liter of any
other alcoholic beverage. After this
policy was put into effect, the Boston
licensing board stated that all Boston
Buse must restrict the amount of

families, and the total value of the
school was $63,000. Sanders said that
the general would be pleased with the
school today.

There were several contributions
that Lee made to the university, which
undoubtedly have gone largely unre-
cognized. Before Lee came to the uni-
versity, the entire curriculum con-
sisted of Greek, Latin and mathema-
tics.

Lee wanted men who were ‘‘trained
in practical professions,’’ so he added
the law school, engineering, journal-
ism, bookkeeping and business. Lee
and the faculty made church atten-
dance voluntary for the first time and
the general was delighted that the stu-
dents opted to attend.

Many feel that the Honor System
was unquestionably Lee’s greatest
contribution to the university. When
he arrived, he abolished the long list
of rules and regulations, which the
school had. He insisted that you could
not tell young people how to live their
lives, that instead they must be taught
by example.

Sanders said that Lee would be very
satisfied with today’s Honor system
and the ways in which it has been
adapted to fit modern times.

Lee sought to teach, through his ac-

adopts new restrictions

alcohol in college dormitories.

The two visitation policies being
considered for inclusion in next year’s
policy revisions include prohibiting
guests of the opposite sex in dorms
and limiting the number of guests al-
lowed in the dorms to four between
the hours of 8-11 p.m. on Sunday-Th-
ursday and from 8 p.m. to | a.m. on
Friday and Saturday.

Scott Edwards, a public relations
spokesperson for the university, said a
task force has been set up to devise the
policies.

Edwards said that complaints from
students and parents concerning the
noise levels and the violation of a stu-
dent’s privacy when a roommate had
guests in the room, prompted the de-

cision to develop the policies. He said,
‘“We wanted to maintain a serious
study environment at Boston Univer-
sity.”’

At a press conference last Wednes-
day, 1,000 students protested the
resolutions. Students said they felt the
university was violating their rights to
freedom.

When asked if he thought the
policies would affect enrollment in the
future, Edwards said, ‘‘That’s hard to
say. I’m sure it will have an effect, but
I’m not sure how much or how little.”’
Edwards also stressed that the visita-
tion policies have not yet been fina-
lized and that the task force is con-
sidering all recommendations for im-
provement of the policies. Since the

Legislature believes the state should
not have to pay.

If the no-smoking law is successful
in deterring these officials from smok-
ing, supporters of the bill believe that
the number of disabilities will be re-
duced and that state disabilities pen-
sion costs will be reduced.

The passage of this law raises many
questions about how far the govern-
ment can go to restrict the behavior of
public employees. Future litigation
suits by either fired or disgruntled
public safety officials could allow the
Massachusetts courts to answer some
of these questions.

Supporters of the ban are confident
that the law will be upheld by the
courts, citing a U.S. Court of Appeals
decision last year affirming the Okla-
homa City Fire Department’s smoking

ban. In that case, a firefighter trainee
was fired for smoking while off duty.
Rejecting the trainee’s contention that
his privacy rights had been violated,
the court ruled that the fire depart-
ment’s regulation was a rational at-
tempt to promote health and physical
conditioning for firefighters. In addi-
tion, since the new law only applies to
new employees who will be made
aware of this condition prior to em-
ployment, many supporters believe
that future complaints will be easily
dealt with in or out of the courts.

Opponents, including union leaders
and Tobacco Institute spokesmen,
contend that the new law will create
numerous disputes, which will ulti-
mately have to be settled in the courts
with a great deal of controversy and
public expense.

Boston University has not yet no-
ticed any change or improvements
since the program was implemented
because it has only been in effect since
Sept. 15. But, Edwards did concede
that the resolutions will be difficult to
enforce. Still, he said that many
schools across the United States have
similar programs, and many more are
following in their footsteps.

Mercer admits to
theft of porcelain

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

R. William Mercer, a 1988 gra-
duate of Washington and Lee, Wed-
nesday admitted he was guilty of steal-
ing $10,000 worth of porcelain and
ivory figurines from the university's
Reeves Center.
Mercer, 22, appeared in Rock-
bridge County Circuit Court and told
the court his plea was guilty, but
Judge George E. Honts III agreed to
withhold acceptance or rejection of
the plea pending a pre-sentence re-
port.

But Mercer’s attorney, Marshall
Mundy of Roanoke, asked the court to
accept the plea under advisement until
a pre-sentence report could be com-
pleted.

Honts refused to accept that motion,

but he did agree to adjourn the case
until the report is available. Honts
may accept or reject Mercer’s guilty
plea when the case is resumed.

If convicted, Mercer could be sen-
tenced to up to 20 years in prison.

Mercer, a native of Charlotte,
of Chinese export porcelain on or
about Aug. 4 and eight small carved
ivory figurines from the Reeves
Center, where he worked last sum-
mer.

After he was arrested on Oct. 16,
Mercer was released on a $5,000 un-
secured bond, according to court re-
cords.

The objects have been returned to
the center, according to Lt. Stephen
E. Crowder of the Lexington Police
Department.

Executive Notes:
EC to meet with trustees

 

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

Executive Committee President
Christopher deMovellan will meet
with the Washington and Lee Univer-
sity Board of Trustees this weekend to
ask the board to fund student needs for
the campus and community, said de-
Movellan at the EC meeting Monday
night.

If anyone has suggestions they want
brought before the Board of Trustees,
deMovellan said to talk to him today
at the latest.

DeMovellan will ask the Board of
Trustees to fund the purchase of two
vans for Live Drive, an organization
that provides transportation to and
from student parties on weekends.

The Board of Trustees is the
governing body of the university.

The entire EC will have lunch with
the Board of Trustees tomorrow after-

noon
_ In other business, the EC decided to

purchase an IBM computer package in
place of the Epson package it had
voted to purchase a month ago. IBM
computers can be serviced on campus
instead of having to be taken to Roan-
oke.

EC secretary Eddie Yu called a dis-
count computer dealer to get price
quotes. The EC agreed to purchase an
IBM PS-20 (model 30) computer with
an IBM monitor and a PP-2 printer for
a total cost of $1,890. A Word Perfect
package also will be purchased for an
additional $125.

Winners of the preliminary fresh-
man class officer elections, which
were held Monday, were announced
at the EC meeting. The run-off elec-
tion was held today.

Two candidates for each position —
EC representative, president and vice
president — were on the ballot in the
run-off election. Clayton A. Kenning-
ton and Fred Renneker won the preli-
minary election for EC representative.

Dean Atkins heads a panel discussion on the Sorority issue at Washington and Lee.

sorority issue discussed

By Eleanor Nelson wast

Staff Reporter

 

A panel discussion on women’s
social organizations took place last
Thursday night in Lee Chapel.

The program’s purpose was to give
students information on sororities and
other possibilities for women’s social
organizations at W&L. A question
and answer session followed the panel
discussion.

National sororities and eating
houses were two possibilities discuss-
ed. The national director for extension
of national sororities, Lissa Bradford
spoke. The dean of Greek affairs at
the University of Richmond, Alison
Lord, discussed the recent coloniza-
tion of national sororities on that
school’s campus.

A senior from Davidson College,
Heather Fitzpatrick, discussed their
campus system of eating houses for

women.

Dean of Greek affairs at W&L,
Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins and the pane-
lists then responded to students ques-
tions. At this time students were able
to express their concerns about the
opportunity of women’s social organi-
zations at W&L.

Bradford and Lord answered ques-
tions ranging from the likelihood of a
rush this year to the likelihood of phy-
sical sorority houses. A winter rush
could take place this school year.
‘‘Physical sorority houses are un-
necessary; we started sororities two
and a half years ago without them at
Richmond and we still don’t have
them,”” said Lord.

At this time, 18 sororities‘are inter-
ested in colonizing at W&L. ‘‘The
sorority advisory committee would
assess which national sororities would
best meet the students’ needs, and
which ones would provide the best co-

lonization support,’’ said Sorority
Advisory Committee member Erin
Cosby.

A forum will take place this Mon-

day, Oct. 24, in Lee Chapel at 7:30

p.m. At this time a panel of two W&L
students and two faculty members will
open discussion on the pros and cons
of sororities, eating clubs and other
possibilities. All studests concerned
with the issue should attend.

The 93 students who signed a peti-
tion for sororities last winter term, the
64 students who asked to be on the ad-
visory committee over the summer,
and the students who attended last
Thursday’s panel all indicate an inter-
est on the W&L campus for some type
of social organizations for women.

decided at this time need to come for-
ward with alternatives to carry their

OPINION

Students Face
‘Alarming’ Risk

Washington and Lee University has always been excellent at pro-
viding needed services to its students. This is especially true with
the housing situation: anyone who needed on-campus housing was
sure to get it.

 

What is not known, however, is that students who do receive on-

campus housing are accepting a dangerous risk that he or she can do
nothing about.

Just what is this risk? It is the all too familiar (and constant) ring-
ing of the fire alarm. So the fire alarms go off all the time? That just
means they work, right? Well, not really, when you consider that
fire alarms are only supposed to go off when there is a REAL fire.

The constant ringing poses a special problem. For one thing, it
never fails to go off at 2 to 3 in the morning. It also never fails that
at 2 or 3 in the morning, the student has 1) just come back from a
long night of studying or 2) just come back from a long night of par-
tying. Imagine, if you will, being disturbed by the unrestrained
ringing of the fire alarm when all you really want to do is sleep.
And that is what most students do —ignore the fire alarm.

The alarms have gone off almost nightly in the new Gaines Resi-
dence Hall in the last few weeks, and everyone knows that it hap-
pens almost constantly in Graham-Lees from the beginning of
Freshman Orientation to Commencement in June. After the fifth
time (and for some, the second time) the alarm has gone off, the de-
sire to leave the building gradually wanes. It is much like the prin-
ciple of diminishing returns: the more it happens, the less anyone
wants to do about it.

The university is responsible for the protection of its students
when they live in on-campus housing. To state the obvious, if
someday there is a REAL fire, no one will know to leave the build-
ing. At best, the Lexington fire department will soon arrive and
contain the fire; at worst, a dorm full of sleepy or intoxicated stu-
dents will not be able to leave in time.

Some can accept that Graham-Lees is an old building and with
this comes a certain understanding that things will malfunction.
This acceptance does not excuse, however, the need to find a solu-
tion to the problem. As long as we have been here, the fire alarm
has not been fixed satisfactorily.

As far as Gaines is concerned, nothing can be excused. The build-
ing is brand new and no amount of reasons (I.E. paint fumes) will
change the fact that the alarm system must be fixed.

This is a serious problem that should be addressed now by the
university. Somewhere along the hierarchy that exists at this
school, someone must take responsibility, whether Buildings and
Grounds does something about it, or a contractor fixes them, or
whoever. Now is the time to take control —before the fire alarm has
rung just one too many times. . ....

‘Lyric to be renovated

The Lyric Theater building on

‘ South Main Street is expected to be

, Tenovated into retail shops and of-

fices, according to one of the buil-

‘ ding’s new co-owners, Patricia
, Roberts.

Roberts said she and her husband,

+ Walter F. Roberts Jr., bought the

, building on April 4, with the hopes of

* opening a restaurant/comedy club.

., Roberts said she wanted the restaurant

to be a step above Spanky’s, but not as

‘ elegant as the Willson-Walker House.

, She called it a ‘‘middle-of-the-road

restaurant,’’ saying that ‘‘There is a

‘ despearate need for that type of res-
, taurant in Lexington.

However, Roberts said the plans tell
‘through since they were not able to
, persuade anyone to take a chance in

Lexington. ‘‘Everyone had re-
‘servations about (the idea) in Lexing-
, ton,’ she said.

tions and not his words, self denial,
service, honor and courage. The stu-
dents and faculty of Washington and
Lee University still hold fast to these
values in a world that occasionally
tempts us to do otherwise. Sanders be-

lieved that Robert E. Lee would be
proud of what he has created, and tou-
ched by the memorial service held in
his memory.

As the audience sang Lee’s favorite
hymn, ‘‘How Firm a Foundation,”’
and the Liberty Hall Volunteers filed
out, thoughts were on the great gen-
eral and the steadfast foundation that
he established so long ago.

‘Hello Lexington’

 

by John Vittori
Staff Reporter

 

‘*Hello Lexington’’ is a welcom-
ing service started by the Lexington
Downtown Development Association
(LDDA) in May 1988, representative
Marjorie Page said.

LDDA Executive Director Diane
Herrick said ‘‘Hello Lexington’’ was
started to welcome new residents to
the town. She said the program is
modeled after a similar welcoming
service in Bedford, Va.

Page said she searches out new resi-
dents by talking to the deans of Wash-
ington and Lee University and Vir-
ginia Military Institute, realtors, and
people in town. ‘‘A big portion of our

new residents are new facul-_

ty,”’ she said.
Page takes a basket of coupons,

. gifts and information from 30 Lexing-

ton businesses and several other non-
profit organizations in town to the new
residents. She also discusses LDDA
with them and provides more informa-
tion on Lexington. She said she is al-
ways asked questions about whom
to call for babysitters, repairs and

‘ even chimney-sweeps. If she is unable

to answer their questions on the spot,
Page said she finds out and calls the
person back. ‘‘It really gives people a
good cross section of the businesses in
the downtown area,’ she said. ‘‘Bu-
sinesses count the coupons that are
used to correctly assess how beneficial
this service is for them,’’ Page said.
But no statistics have been asseembled
yet, Page said.

Liberty Hall Volunteers
honor W&L history

 

Staff Report

 

The Liberty Hall Volunteers will
hold memorial services for Thomas J.
‘*Stonewall’’ Jackson and Robert E.
Lee:

The Volunteers plan a Gentleman’s
Dinner, scheduled for Jan. 19, to
honor the births of Lee and Jackson.

The group also will honor the 126th
anniversary of Jackson’s death with a
service on the weekend of May 13.

According to David Burns, one of
the group’s leaders, last year the
group marched in uniform to Jack-
son’s grave, laid a wreath and fired a
volley from their rifles.

Wednesday, the group held a me-

morial service for Lee in Lee Chapel
on the Washington and Lee University

_ campus.

‘*Last year, a group of concerned
students realized that there was noth-
ing commemorating the death of Lee
and decided to begin an annual ser-
vice,’’ said Burns.

The Liberty Hall Volunteers is an
organization formed to ‘‘educate the
Washington and Lee community as to
the role played by students of Wash-
ington College during the Civil War,”’
Burns added.

The Volunteers dress up in Civil
War uniforms and drill, using infantry
tactics from that era. They re-create
Company I of the Fourth Virginia In-
fantry, the ‘Stonewall Brigade.”’

Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee University’s
Homecoming Weekend was ‘‘kind of
wild,’’ according to Lexington Police
Chief B.M. Beard.

Arrests were up overall and this has
the police concerned, said Beard.

The biggest increase was seen in the

-ces (DUIs) issued. According to
Beard, there were nine arrests for

~ DUIs during the weekend (two were

of non- students).

The high number of DUIs are still
the police’s greatest concern, said
Beard

Beard explained that officers are
taught to look for drivers who might
be driving while impaired.

“They will usually follow someone
who is zig-zagging or weaving. In
cases like this, there is a 75 percent
chance that the driver is drunk,”’
Beard said.

Following Monday’s forum, a one-
page survey will be sent to all under-

survey’s results, the committee will
either disband or proceed with a sup-
ported plan for social organizations.
The surveys should be turned in to the
Dean of Students’ office.

ministration told her that women
could not swim there because the only
access was through the men’s locker
room. It took a year to convince the
administration to allow women to
swim in the old pool, she said.

All three women said they felt
women in law were accepted. ‘*There
are problems about women’s percep-
tion... but it’s a societal concern...
We've seen slow change, but it’s a
slow. collective positive change,”’
said White, a law librarian and associ-
ate professor of law at the W&L Law
School.

Garrison, the first woman on the
W&L Alumni Board and the first
woman on the W&L Law Council,
echoed Wiant’s views when she said,
“TI felt no problems in women being
accepted as professional lawyers.
There have been some awkward situa-
tions, but they were funny.”’

Karin Garvin, president of the
WLSO, organized the seminar and
said that the WLSO plans to organize
more events in the future to ‘‘reach
out to undergraduate women and to
encourage undergraduate women to
get involved in some of WLSO’s acti-
vities.’’ WLSO is currently planning a
day, tentatively in November, for
undergraduate women to attend law
school classes for a day, talk with ad-
ministration and participate in infor-
mal discussions.

New hotel?

By Cheryl Bowles
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Lexington City Council Thurs-
day approved permission for de-
veloper David J. Nodine to apply for
an Urban Development Action Grant
(UDAG) for the construction of a
downtown hotel.

The council approved the applica-
tion even though the funding for the
federal grant has been suspended in-
definitely. The cost of the hotel de-
velopment is estimated at $1.5 mil-
lion.

Nodine is planning to build the new
hotel in the historical Old Main Street
Mall building without destroying the
original structure, said Kathy Causey,
administrative assistant to City Man-
ager Joseph C. King. She said Nodine
plans to make interior changes, add to
the top of the building, and extend it
back toward Randolph Street.

If Nodine gets the grapt, he will be
expected to repay the city with re-
venue from the hotel, and the city has
agreed to use some of that money to
build a parking lot for the hotel.

Interfraternity Council rep-
resentatives to the October 15 meeting
of the Alumni Fraternity Corporation
(AFC) reported an adamant concern
within the corporation regarding the
purchase of alcohol, particularly kegs
of beer, with house funds.

Every W&L fraternity, except Kap-
pa Sigma, has a rule against house-
funded alcohol purchases. The
alumni, however, are pushing for the
adoption of an IFC Constitution By-
Law requiring each house to live by
uniform restrictions.

“The, idea,’’ contends IFC Vice-
President Jeff Kelsey, ‘‘is that every-
body has got to live by the same
rules.’’ Most house corporations of
chapters on campus have already es-
tablished regulations regarding this
matter, but all the regulations are
worded differently and have different
provisions. One fraternity president
commented, for example, that his
chapter is permitted to buy alcohol for
special occasions, such as Parents’
Weekend, with special permission of
its house corporation.

ference to many fraternities’ practice
of pooling money from the member-
ship body to purchase alcohol for a
party. ‘‘It doesn’t make any difference
how it’s paid for,’’ he continued. ‘‘It’s
still the fraternity buying the alco-
hol.”’

One reason for regulations are to
protect fraternities from liability for
serving alcohol to guests. This issue
concerns every house, nationally as
well as locally.

Although the banning of kegs is an
unpopular idea, safety is the motivat-
ing factor behind the ban.

Squids slip past Generals

Mistakes prove costly in 22-20 loss

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

W&L football’s starting offense and
starting defense turned in their best
performances of the season Saturday,

\but their best wasn’t good enough to
keep Hampden-Sydney from spoiling
yet another W&L homecoming.

On the last play of the first half, the
Tigers took advantage of a prevent de-
fense that didn’t. Later, they were just
as opportunistic on a bad snap on a
fourth-quarter punt to steal a 22-20
victory that left W&L coach Gary Fal-
lon disappointed with the final score
but not with his team’s play overall.

‘*We gave forth a tremendous effort
against a good football team,’’ Fallon
said. ‘‘We’re improving every
week.”’

The game began with W&L’s most
impressive drive of the season. The
Generals balanced rushing by senior
tailback Tony Waskiewicz and junior
fullback Russell Crosby with the pass-
ing attack of junior quarterback Phil-
lip Sampson, and the result was a
15-play, 63-yard scoring drive that
ended with a four-yard carry by soph-
omore tailback Mason Pope. Sopho-
more Carter Quayle’s extra point gave
W&L a 7-0 lead with 8:22 left in the
first quarter.

The Tigers responded with a

, 58-yard drive built around running
back Chris Barth. The W&L defense
‘ held on third down at its own 12, but
, Tommy Mallis came on to kick a
29-yard field goal and cut the W&L
« lead to four.

But the W&L offense would soon
get back its seven-point lead. The
Generals drove to midfield before the
first quarter ended, and Sampson

‘ found Waskiewicz for a 22-yard gain
, on the first play of the second. Four

downs later, Quayle nailed a 39-yard
field goal that put W&L back up by a
touchdown.

The defenses took over for most of
the rest of the second period. The
Generals failed to capitalize on two
Sydney turnovers in the quarter — a
fumbled Tom Skeen punt that was re-
covered by senior defensive end Tony
Onorato and an interception by junior

Bland Warren — and the W&L
offense stalled on a fourth-and-three
play at the Tiger 10.

Fallon later said he wanted more
than a 10-point halftime lead— which
is all a Quayle field goal would have
given him — and so went for it on
fourth down.

‘‘We have to score touchdowns
when we can get them,”’ Fallon said,
and so he called a pass-option play
that sent three receivers out of the
backfield on short patterns and al-
lowed Sampson to run if a hole opened
up. But the W&L receivers got cros-
sed up on their patterns, according to
Fallon, and Sampson’s pass to junior
tight end Bob Martin fell incomplete.
The Tigers took over on downs at
their own 10 with 1:17 left in the half.

Hampden-Sydney ran eight plays
before the period ended, and on seven
of them the Tiger two-minute offense
was somewhere between mediocre
and awful. But the last play of the half
was — what else — a Flutie-esque
bomb in the end zone. Four W&L
safeties were back on Fallon’s prevent
defense, but flanker Stephen Waskey
pulled in the 51-yard prayer. Mallis
kicked the extra point to tie the score
at 10.

But the Tigers couldn’t carry any
momentum from that play into the
third quarter. They took the second-
half kickoff but drove only 17 yards
on seven plays before punting.

Instead it was the Generals who

started the second-half scoring.
Quayle’s eighth field goal of the
season, a 40-yarder that tied the
school record for most field goals in
one season, came after a 51-yard drive
and gave the Generals a 13-10 lead.

After an exchange of punts, the
Tigers re-tied the game early in the
fourth quarter on a 24-yard kick by
Mallis.

The Generals started their next
drive at the W&L 16 with 11:54 re-
maining, but the offense stalled when
Pope was stopped for no gain on
fourth and one at the Hampden-
Sydney 44.

The Tigers couldn’t take advantage,
though, and punted to the W&L 22.
Two incompletions and a sack sent
Tom Skeen into the game to punt.
Onorato’s snap was high, and Skeen
was forced to take a safety that gave ~
the Tigers a 15-13 lead.

Unfortunately for the Generals, that
safety would go on to cost more than
two points. With newfound momen-
tum, the Tigers went on their most
impressive drive of the day. Hamp-
den-Sydney’s offense clicked for at
least 3 yards on six straight plays, in-
cluding two Barth carries for 9 yards,
and scored on an 18-yard run by full-
back Chris Underwood. Mallis added
the point after that gave the Tigers a
commanding 22-13 lead with only
2:34 remaining.

With only 1:15 left, Hampden-
Sydney, coach Joe Bush sent in his
backups to run out the clock, and the
W&L defense took full advantage.
The Tigers were held to only eight
yards on three plays and ran an option
play on fourth and four. Onorato step-
ped in front of the pitch and grabbed it
out of midair. Eighty-two yards later,
he was mauled by jubilant Generals
who realized that the game, with 1:15
remaining, wasn’t out of reach.

West equals success for polo

 

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water polo team traveled wes-
twang: thisipast weekend with something to prove. The
Genérals Wanted to show the some of the top teams on the
WeS&t Coast) that a Eastern school like W&L could play
good water polo. The West Coast teams have heard of
schools like Navy, Brown and Bucknell but now they have
to include W&L in that list of good East Coast water polo
programs.

The Generals, ranked 18th in the nation, began their
mission by facing 19th-ranked Claremont on Friday after-
noon. W&L came out of the locker room pumped up and
ready to play. It was immediately apparent that the team
was in for a dogfight. There was not much scoring in the
first half and the two teams went into the halftime tied at
1-1.

The second half was as close as the first but with a little
more offensive production. Senior David Dietz scored
four goals to give head coach Page Remillard, who coa-
ched at Claremont before coming to W&L, one of his
biggest wins of his coaching career. The final score was
5-4 with the key to the victory being the goaltending per-
formance of junior David Olson.

**All weekend Olson gave the team lifetime performan-
ces, said illard. ‘‘He played extremely well after com-

| ing off a serious sprain in three of his fingers on his throw-

ing hand. We have to give credit to our trainer for getting
David healthy.”

After the Generals’ victory over Claremont, they headed
south for San Diego where they played the No. 10 team in
the nation, University of California at San Diego. The
Generals came, put strong and took a 2-1 lead after the first
quarter. At this point in the game, jet lag seemed to catch
up with W&I.. UCSD took control and went on the beat
the Generals 13-3.

“It was a combination of them being a better team and
us being tired. They took the upper hand in the game and
like a good team they didn’t let us back in it,’’ said Remil-
lard.

The Generals’ final game of the trip was against Pomon-
a-Pitzer University. W&L was in control of the entire
game, coasting to victory by the score of 15-8. The
offensive output was led by Dietz with 5 goals, senior Da-
vid Reavy with 3 goals and freshman Jay Smith with 2
goals. Once again Olson shined in goal for the Generals
and capped off a great weekend for both himself and the
team.

Overall, Remillard was extremely pleased. ‘‘We drew
the attention of serious students from the West Coast.
These young men now realize they have a place to go in the
East to get an excellent education and play good water
polo,”’ he said.

The Generals will now look ahead to the first round of
the Southern League Tournament this weekend in Wil-
mington, N.C.

Volleyball

continues
to improve

 

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
volleyball team has been very busy for
the past week improving on its win-
ning record. The Generals moved to
11-6 overall after Tuesday night’s ac-
tion.

The Generals picked up another Old
Dominion Athletic Conference vic-
tory Friday night in Hollins. The
W&L women went down the road to
battle the women from Hollins and the
Generals drove home with a 15-3,
15-2, 12-15, 15-8 victory under their
belts.

But W&L may have gained more
than just a victory with its perfor-
mance against Hollins. The Generals
Virtually assured themselves of a berth
in the ODAC Tournament with the
win.

Things did not go as well for W&L
four days later, however. Although
they beat Salem College, 13-15, 15-6,
15-8, the Generals suffered a tough
ODAC setback at the hands of Emory
and Henry. W&L fell to the Wasps
15-2, 10-15, 15-8, 15-4.

The Generals began a comeback in
the second game of the match with
E&H, but they were unable to swing
the match back in their favor. Fresh-
men starters Marcy Brown and Ra-
shmi Sachan, who leads the team in
service percentage, were both out
with injuries, which continues to be a
sore spot for W&L head coach Susan
Dittman.

But Dittman praised the efforts of
substitutes junior Debbie Grove and
sophomore Connie Papazickos, say-
ing both were impressive in their first
starts.

While injuries continue to be a prob-
lem, Dittman is pleased with her
team’s talent and play. Experience is
the only missing ingredient

. ‘*We don’t have a big power hitter
like a lot of teams that we play,”’
Dittman said. ‘We get in great rallies,
but we have trouble putting it down
and winning the points. That will all
come with more experience.’’

Dittman said the team has been get-
ting that experience and is learning to
make the necessary adjustments to
other teams’ strengths.

The big players for the Generals
have been sophomore Lisa Jay, who
continues to set weil, senior co-
captain Vanessa Hartman, who leads
the team in hitting, freshman Mena
McGowin, who is tied with Hartman
for the lead in blocks per game, and
senior co-captain Melissa Thrasher,
who has been the most consistent
player on the team, ranking second in
both serving and hitting. The Gen-
erals’ next action is tonight in the
Warner Center, when ODAC-rival
Sweet Briar and Ferrum are in town
for a tri-match. The Sweet Briar
match is set to begin at 6:30.

Clark captures first place;
Teams ‘run well’ for fourth

Mary Washington, Eastern Mennon-
ite, Christopher Newport and Hamp-
ton Institute. Hampton was the only
D-II team to beat the Generals.

‘‘It was a good meet for us, espe-
cially in getting us ready for ODAC’s
(the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence meet) and Regionals,’’ Miller
said.

For the women’s team, the Gen-
erals’ performance almost mirrored
the men’s effort. Sophomore Paige
Cason was W&L’s top finisher, taking
8th place in a time of 20:38 for the
3.1-mile course. Classmate Cecily
Tynan also ran well ending up with a
14th-place finish. The Generals (3-3)
placed fourth overall out of eight
teams.

*“*] thought the women ran well
also,’’ Miller said. ‘‘Like I said, it
was a really good meet for both
teams.”’

This Saturday, the men’s team
travels to Bridgewater for a tri-meet
against the host school and West Vir-
ginia Tech, two teams Miller said he
did not expect to many problems with.
The women’s team will be idle this
week.

Both teams will have one more dual
meet on Oct. 29 before gearing up for
the conference championships on
Nov. 5. to be followed by the NCAA
Regional Championships on Nov. 12.

New hotel?

By Cheryl Bowles

ministration

 

 

The Lexington City Council Thurs-
day approved permission for de-
veloper David J. Nodine to apply for
an Urban Development Action Grant
(UDAG) for the construction of a
downtown hotel.

The council approved the applica-
tion even though the funding for the
federal grant has been suspended in-
definitely. The cost of the hotel de-
velopment is estimated at $1.5 mil-
lion,

Nodine is planning to build the new
hotel in the historical Old Main Street
Mall building without destroying the
original structure, said Kathy Causey,
administrative assistant to City Man-
ager Joseph C, King. She said Nodine
plans to make interior changes, add to
the ton of the building, and extend it
back toward Randolph Street.

If Nodine gets the grapt, he will be
expected to repay the city with re-
venue from the hotel, and the city has
agreed to use some of that money to
build a parking lot for the hotel.

Rangers play to win

By James Johnson
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee University’s
ROTC ranger challenge team partici-
pated in a head-to-head ranger compe-
tition against teams from the Univer-
sity of Virginia, James Madison Uni-
versity and Virginia Military Institute

petition will take place Oct. 21-23 at
Fort A.P. Hill, Va.

By-laws reviewed

By Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

 

Interfraternity Council rep-
resentatives to the October 15 meeting
of the Alumni Fraternity Corporation
(AFC) reported an adamant concern
within the corporation regarding the
purchase of alcohol, particularly kegs
of beer, with house funds.

Every W&L fraternity, except Kap-
pa Sigma, has a rule against house-
funded alcohol purchases. The
alumni, however, are pushing for the
adoption of an IFC Constitution By-
Law requiring each house to live by
uniform restrictions.

*‘The, idea,’’ contends IFC Vice-
President Jeff Kelsey, ‘‘is that every-
body has got to live by the same
rules.’’ Most house corporations of
chapters on campus have already es-
tablished regulations regarding this
matter, but all the regulations are
worded differently and have different
provisions. One fraternity president
commented, for example, that his
chapter is permitted to buy alcohol for
special occasions, such as Parents’
Weekend, with special permission of
its house corporation,

than an inconvenient rule that can be
skirted,’’ said Leroy C. ‘*Buddy”’ At-
kins, dean of greek affairs, in re-
ference to many fraternities’ practice
of pooling money from the member-
ship body to purchase alcohol for a
party. ‘‘It doesn’t make any difference
how it’s paid for,’’ he continued. ‘‘It’s
still the fraternity buying the alco-
hol.”’

One reason for regulations are to
protect fraternities from liability for
serving alcohol to guests. This issue
concerns every house, nationally as
well as locally.

Although the banning of kegs is an
unpopular idea, safety is the motivat-
ing factor behind the ban.

Squids slip past Generals

Mistakes prove costly in 22-20 loss

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

WA&L football's starting offense and
starting defense turned in their best
performances of the season Saturday,
but their best wasn’t good enough to
keep Hampden-Sydney from spoiling
yet another W&L homecoming.

On the last play of the first half, the
Tigers took advantage of a prevent de-
fense that didn’t. Later, they were just
as opportunistic on a bad snap on a
fourth-quarter punt to steal a 22-20
victory that left W&L coach Gary Fal-
lon disappointed with the final score
but not with his team’s play overall.

‘*We gave forth a tremendous effort
against a good football team,’’ Fallon
said. ‘‘We'’re improving every
week.”’

The game began with W&L’s most
impressive drive of the season. The
Generals balanced rushing by senior
tailback Tony Waskiewicz and junior
fullback Russell Crosby with the pass-
ing attack of junior quarterback Phil-
lip Sampson, and the result was a
15-play, 63-yard scoring drive that
ended with a four-yard carry by soph-
omore tailback Mason Pope. Sopho-
more Carter Quayle’s extra point gave
WA&L a 7-0 lead with 8:22 left in the
first quarter.

The Tigers responded with a
58-yard drive built around running
back Chris Barth. The W&L defense
held on third down at its own 12, but
Tommy Mallis came on to kick a
29-yard field goal and cut the W&L
lead to four.

But the W&L offense would soon
get back its seven-point lead. The
Generals drove to midfield before the
first quarter ended, and Sampson
found Waskiewicz for a 22-yard gain
on the first play of the second. Four

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team experienced a tough
, week, playing well but coming
away with only a scoreless tie and a
shutout loss.

h On Friday, W&L goalies junior
Jack Pringle and sophomore Jon
Bull combined to shut out Guilford
in double overtime. However, the
Generals offense was stymied as

well and W&L was forced to settle
with a 0-0 tie.
Wednesday, the Generals

traveled to Fredricksburg where
there offensive continued, losing to
12th-ranked Mary Washington
4-0. W&L’s record now stands at
5-5-1, 2-1 in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. Saturday on
the Liberty Hall Fields, W&L
plays Washington College at 2
p.m.

 

The W&L women’s soccer team

downs later, Quayle nailed a 39-yard
field goal that put W&L back up by a
touchdown.

The defenses took over for most of
the rest of the second period. The
Generals failed to capitalize on two
Sydney turnovers in the quarter — a
fumbled Tom Skeen punt that was re-
covered by senior defensive end Tony
Onorato and an interception by junior
Bland Warren — and the W&L
offense stalled on a fourth-and-three
play at the Tiger 10.

Fallon later said he wanted more
than a 10-point halftime lead— which
is all a Quayle field goal would have
given him — and so went for it on
fourth down.

‘‘We have to score touchdowns
when we can get them,”’ Fallon said,
and so he called a pass-option play
that sent three receivers out of the
backfield on short patterns and al-
lowed Sampson to run if a hole opened
up. But the W&L receivers got cros-
sed up on their patterns, according to
Fallon, and Sampson’s pass to junior
tight end Bob Martin fell incomplete.
The Tigers took over on downs at
their own 10 with 1:17 left in the half.

Hampden-Sydney ran eight plays
before the period ended, and on seven
of them the Tiger two-minute offense
was somewhere between mediocre
and awful. But the last play of the half
was — what else — a Flutie-esque
bomb in the end zone. Four W&L
safeties were back on Fallon’s prevent
defense, but flanker Stephen Waskey
pulled in the 51-yard prayer. Maallis
kicked the extra point to tie the score
at 10.

But the Tigers couldn’t carry any
momentum from that play into the
third quarter. They took the second-
half kickoff but drove only 17 yards
on seven plays before punting.

Instead it was the Generals who

W&L were junior Catherine Bail-
lio and freshmen Ann Shaunessy
and Katie Seeman.

On Saturday on the Liberty Hall
fields, W&L hung tough with Ran-
dolph-Macon before succumbing
by the score of 3-0. Wednesday,
the Generals fell 2-1 to Virginia
Wesleyan on the road. The
women's record is currently 6-8,
3-3 in the ODAC. The Generals
play at Hollins Saturday and then
play host to Sweet Briar on Tues-
day in the first round of the ODAC
Tournament. Game time on the
Liberty Hall Fields is 4 p.m.

 

The W&L women's tennis team
completed its fall season with a
sparkling 8-1 mark. The Generals’
only defeat came at the hands of
Mary Washington, the defending
Division [I National Champions,
in a hard-fought 5-4 match. The
women are co-coached by Assis-
tant Athletic Director Cinda Ran-
kin and David McLeod 88’, a for-
mer W&L all-America tennis
player and currently a W&L ad-
missions assistant.

started the second-half scoring.
Quayle’s eighth field goal of the
season, a 40-yarder that tied the
school record for most field goals in
one season, came after a 51-yard drive
and gave the Generals a 13-10 lead.

After an exchange of punts, the
Tigers re-tied the game early in the
fourth quarter on a 24-yard kick by
Mallis.

The Generals started their next
drive at the W&L 16 with 11:54 re-
maining, but the offense stalled when
Pope was stopped for no gain on
fourth and one at the Hampden-
Sydney 44.

The Tigers couldn’t take advantage,
though, and punted to the W&L 22.
Two incompletions and a sack sent
Tom Skeen into the game to punt.
Onorato’s snap was high, and Skeen
was forced to take a safety that gave
the Tigers a 15-13 lead.

Unfortunately for the Generals, that
safety would go on to cost more than
two points. With newfound momen-
tum, the Tigers went on their most
impressive drive of the day. Hamp-
den-Sydney’s offense clicked for at
least 3 yards on six straight plays, in-
cluding two Barth carries for 9 yards,
and scored on an 18-yard run by full-
back Chris Underwood. Mallis added
the point after that gave the Tigers a
commanding 22-13 lead with only
2:34 remaining.

With only 1:15 left, Hampden-
Sydney coach Joe Bush sent in his
backups to run out the clock, and the
W&L defense took full advantage.
The Tigers were held to only eight
yards on three plays and ran an option
play on fourth and four. Onorato step-
ped in front of the pitch and grabbed it
out of midair. Eighty-two yards later,

West equals success for polo

 

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee water polo team traveled wes-
tward:thisipast weekend with something to prove. The
Genérals Wanted to show the some of the top teams on the
We&t Coast) that a Eastern school like W&L could play
good water polo. The West Coast teams have heard of
schools like Navy, Brown and Bucknell but now they have
to include W&L in that list of good East Coast water polo
programs.

The Generals, ranked 18th in the nation, began their
mission by facing 19th-ranked Claremont on Friday after-
noon. W&L came out of the locker room pumped up and
ready to play. It was immediately apparent that the team
was in for a dogfight. There was not much scoring in the
first half and the two teams went into the halftime tied at
1-1.

The second half was as close as the first but with a little
more offensive production. Senior David Dietz scored
four goals to give head coach Page Remillard, who coa-
ched at Claremont before coming to W&L, one of his
biggest wins of his coaching career. The final score was
5-4 with the key to the victory being the goaltending per-
formance of junior David Olson.

‘All weekend Olson gave the team lifetime performan-
ces, said Remillard. ‘‘He played extremely well after com-
ing off a serious sprain in three of his fingers on his throw-

ing hand. We have to give credit to our trainer for getting
David healthy.”’

After the Generals’ victory over Claremont, they headed
south for San Diego where they played the No. 10 team in
the nation, University of California at San Diego. The
Generals came, out strong and took a 2-1 lead after the first
quarter. At this point in the game, jet lag seemed to catch
up with W&L. UCSD took control and went on the beat
the Generals 13-3.

“It was a combination of them being a better team and
us being tired. They took the upper hand in the game and
like a good team they didn’t let us back in it,’’ said Remil-
lard.

The Generals’ final game of the trip was against Pomon-
a-Pitzer University. W&L was in control of the entire
game, coasting to victory by the score of 15-8. The
offensive output was led by Dietz with 5 goals, senior Da-
vid Reavy with 3 goals and freshman Jay Smith with 2
goals. Once again Olson shined in goal for the Generals
and capped off a great weekend for both himself and the
team.

Overall, Remillard was extremely pleased. ‘‘We drew
the attention of serious students from the West Coast.
These young men now realize they have a place to go in the
East to get an excellent education and play good water
polo,”’ he said.

The Generals will now look ahead to the first round of
the Southern League Tournament this weekend in Wil-
mington, N.C.

Volleyball

continues
to improve

 

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
volleyball team has been very busy for
the past week improving on its win-
ning record. The Generals moved to
11-6 overall after Tuesday night's ac-
tion.

The Generals picked up another Old
Dominion Athletic Conference vic-
tory Friday night in Hollins. The
W&L women went down the road to
battle the women from Hollins and the
Generals drove home with a 15-3,
15-2, 12-15, 15-8 victory under their
belts.

But W&L may have gained more
than just a victory with its perfor-
mance against Hollins. The Generals
virtually assured themselves of a berth
in the ODAC Tournament with the
win.

Things did not go as well for W&L
four days later, however. Although
they beat Salem College, 13-15, 15-6,
15-8, the Generals suffered a tough
ODAC setback at the hands of Emory
and Henry. W&L fell to the Wasps
15-2, 10-15, 15-8, 15-4.

The Generals began a comeback in
the second game of the match with
E&H, but they were unable to swing
the match back in their favor. Fresh-
men starters Marcy Brown and Ra-
shmi Sachan, who leads the team in
service percentage, were both out
with injuries, which continues to be a
sore spot for W&L head coach Susan
Dittman.

But Dittman praised the efforts of
substitutes junior Debbie Grove and
sophomore Connie Papazickos, say-
ing both were impressive in their first
Starts.

While injuries continue to be a prob-
lem, Dittman is pleased with her
team’s talent and play. Experience is
the only missing ingredient

. ‘We don’t have a big power hitter
like a lot of teams that we play,”’
Dittman said. ‘*We get in great rallies,
but we have trouble putting it down
and winning the points. That will all
come with more experience. ”’

Dittman said the team has been get-
ting that experience and is learning to
make the necessary adjustments to
other teams’ strengths.

The big players for the Generals
have been sophomore Lisa Jay, who
continues to set weil, senior co-
captain Vanessa Hartman, who leads
the team in hitting, freshman Mena
McGowin, who is tied with Hartman
for the lead in blocks per game, and
senior co-captain Melissa Thrasher,
who has been the most consistent
player on the team, ranking second in
both serving and hitting. The Gen-
erals’ next action is tonight in the
Warner Center, when ODAC-rival
Sweet Briar and Ferrum are in town
for a tri-match. The Sweet Briar
match is set to begin at 6:30.

Clark captures first place;
Teams ‘run well’ for fourth

Mary Washington, Eastern Mennon-
ite, Christopher Newport and Hamp-
ton Institute. Hampton was the only
D-II team to beat the Generals.

‘It was a good meet for us, espe-
cially in getting us ready for ODAC’s
(the Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence meet) and Regionals,’’ Miller
said.

For the women’s team, the Gen-
erals’ performance almost mirrored
the men’s effort. Sophomore Paige
Cason was W&L’s top finisher, taking
8th place in a time of 20:38 for the
3.1-mile course. Classmate Cecily
Tynan also ran well ending up with a
14th-place finish. The Generals (3-3)
placed fourth overall out of eight
teams.

“I thought the women ran well
also,’’ Miller said. ‘‘Like I said, it
was a really good meet for both
teams.”

This Saturday, the men’s team
travels to Bridgewater for a tri-meet
against the host school and West Vir-
ginia Tech, two teams Miller said he
did not expect to many problems with.
The women’s team will be idle this
week,

Both teams will have one more dual
meet on Oct. 29 before gearing up for
the conference championships on
Nov. 5. to be followed by the NCAA
Regional Championships on Nov, 12.

What is your all-time favorite movie ?

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Last weekend one of the networks
aired a program hosted by Jerry Lewis
where people could call in and vote on
their favorite films in the categories of
comedy, drama, action/adventure and
science fiction/horror. Being some-
what of a film fanatic, I tuned in to
watch what I thought were the best
films in these genres blow away the
competition.

Well folks, it just didn’t happen.

For starters, the morons that called
into this show picked Tootsie as the
all-time greatest comedy. Well I’m
real sorry, but there’s no way. Come
on. Tootsie over Chaplin and Keaton?
Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and
Costello? O.K. forget slapstick. How
about The Graduate and for the sake
of argument (not the greatest comedy
of all-time but certainly in the same
class as Tootsie) how about The Blues
Brothers?

Unfortunately the disappointments
didn’t end with the comedy category.
Raiders of the Lost Ark won the action
category over The Bridge on the River
Kwai, Star Wars won the science fic-
tion/horror category over Close En-
counters of the Third Kind and Gone
With the Wind beat out Casablanca,
The African Queen, Citizen Kane and
The Godfather for best drama. In addi-
tion, Gone With the Wind won honors
as the best film of all-time because it
got the most calls during the night.

Well, I hate to be harsh, but the pin-
heads that called in and voted on this
show are clueless.

I realize that everyone is entitled to
their opinions but give me a break,
huh. I mean when was the last time
The Bridge on the River Kwai or Citi-
zen Kane came in second in a film
competition? Uh, never maybe. Ask
your parents what they think since
they were around when these films
were made. My dad thinks The Bridge
on the River Kwai is the greatest thing
since sliced white bread.

Regardless, I have decided to solve
this argument (at least part of it) once

and for all. In the coming weeks a
couple of boxes are going to be put in
busy areas of the campus and in those
boxes we want you to put a list of your
favorite ten films of all-time. If you
can rank them that would be nice but if
you can’t, just list them in any order.
In two or three weeks I'll run the re-
sults here on The Back Page and we'll
find out once and for all ‘‘What is the
all-time favorite film at Washington
and Lee?’’ (Another one of those
burning questions that our parents are
spending $20,000 a year for us to find
out.)

To kind of start things off, here are
my top ten favorite films of all-time.
Remember, you're not choosing the
best of all-time. Choose your
favorites.

Tug’s Tag All-Time Top Ten

10. Whose Life is it Anyway? (1981,
Dir. John Badham)

Richard Dreyfuss gives what I think is
his tour de force performance as a
sculptor who becomes a quadroplegic
in a car accident and then argues that
he has the right to die if he so desires.
John Cassavetes and Christine Lahti
also give wonderful performances as
Dreyfuss’ doctors. The film is moving
and very powerful.

9. Moscow on the Hudson (1984, Dir.
Paul Mazursky)

Again choosing outstanding perfor-
mances, Robin Williams gives the
performance of his career in this
sleeper about a Russian circus musi-
cian who defects to the United States.
The film is excellent all the way
around, but Williams performance
makes it worth watching over and
over and over.

8. The Elephant Man (1980, Dir. Da-
vid Lynch)

Beautiful black and white film chroni-
cling the life of John Merrick, a
nineteenth century London man who
was so badly stricken with elephantia-
sis (a type of leprosy characterized by
swelling of the lymph glands) that he

was branded the Elephant Man and ta-
ken around to circus sideshows. John
Hurt plays Merrick beautifully as does
Anthony Hopkins as the doctor who
saves Merrick from the sideshow hor-
rors. Perfectly directed and filmed by
Lynch.

7. The Graduate (1967, Dir. Mike Ni-
chols)

No question one of America’s most
beloved films with Dustin Hoffman in
his film debut, Anne Bancroft and a
phenomenal score by Simon and Gar-
funkel. You've heard of ‘‘Every Col-
lege Boy’s Dream.’’ Well, this film
spells it out pretty clearly. Absolutely
hilarious. My hands down pick for
funniest film of all-time.

6. The Natural (1984, Dir. Barry Le-
vinson)

Definitely one of the most cliche films
ever made (although it doesn’t seem
like it as much after the Kirk Gibson
story in Game | of the World Series).
Beautiful film to watch and acted
superbly with Robert Redford, Glenn
Close, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brim-
ley, Robert Duvall, Barbara Hershey
and the rest of this all-star cast. One of
those movies that makes you stand up
and cheer even though you know
what’s going to happen.

5. The Godfather (1972, Dir. Francis
Ford Coppola)

What can you say? All-star cast that
put Robert Duvall, James Caan and Al
Pacino up for Best Supporting Actor
and of course put Brando up for Best
Actor which he won. There is very
little you can criticize this film for.
Consistently one of America’s
favorite films and rightly so. One of
the finest films ever made and by far
the finest film concerning the mafia.

4. Out of Africa (1985, Dir. Sydney
Pollack)

One of the most beautiful films ever
made due to the acting and the incre-
dible Oscar-winning cinematography.
Meryl Streep is absolutely pheno-
menal and were it not for the sym-

pathy vote for Geraldine Page at the
Oscars, Streep would have easily won
her third award. Klaus-Maria Bran-
dauer is equally good. Reford even
puts in a good performance.

3. Chariots of Fire (1981, Dir. Hugh
Hudson)

Beautiful British film about a runner
who refuses to run on Sunday in the
1924 Olympic Games. Beautifully
filmed and acted. Ben Cross and Ian
Charleson are wonderful in the leads.
Won Best Picture over Reds, Raiders
of the Lost Ark and On Golden Pond.
Inspiring music and cinematography
make this a film to move you and take
your breath away.

2. The Dresser (1983, Dir.
Yates)

Another beautiful British import about
an aging Shakespearean actor and his
valet in World War I London. Albert
Finney gives the performance of his
career as Sir, the aging, dying actor
who can never remember which role
he is performing as does Tom Cour-
tenay in the role of his dresser. The
film is more of a character study than
anything else and is a little slow but is
a wonderful watch.

Peter

1. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982,
Steven Spielberg)

Yes, this is a cheesy pick for number
one and no, I’m not ashamed to say I
love this movie. I saw this movie three
times in one day and scary as that may
sound, I’m still not tired of it. I would
think that by now, everyone has seen
E.T., but if you haven’t you’re just in
time for the release of the videotape
version due to hit video stores this
week. This is one of the most heart-
t warming films ever made without
question and though it is already the
number one grossing film of all-time,
it will blow the roof off the list when
the videotape is released. It’s a feel-
good movie, it’s funny and with
Spielberg behind the controls some-
what believable. It’s absolutely...
well, rent it and see. I’m going to
stand in line at the video store.
