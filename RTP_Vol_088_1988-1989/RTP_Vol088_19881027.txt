Trustees pass fraternity renovation plan

4

 

by Heidi Read
Tri-Editor

 

The Board of Trustees last weekend
unanimously approved a $10 million
program designed to renovate the uni-
versity’s 17 fraternity houses.

The goal of the ‘‘Fraternity Renais-
sance Program’’ is to set uniform
standards in all the local chapters and
strengthen the fraternity system over-
all.

Thomas Touchton, chairman of the
trustees’ campus life committee,
called the action ‘‘the most important

\ decision since we voted to become

coeducational’’ in 1984.
W&L President John D. Wilson,

‘ who is on leave for fall term, wrote in

a memorandum ‘to the trustees,
‘Fraternities at Washington and Lee
) have a larger, more generous place in
the historic life of this institution.

‘‘Over the years, almost every stu-
\ dent belonged to one or another of the
houses, lived there and ate there,
made lasting friendships, enjoyed

Old tales told
of Halloween

The sounds of ‘‘Trick or Treat”’
soon will be upon Lexington, although
the signs of Halloween have been here
for a couple of weeks. The weather
_ has gotten colder, the leaves are
changing color and there’s a full moon
in the sky — and those are just
nature’s subtle hints! All around Lex-
ington one can see carved jack 0’ lan-
terns, fake spiders and monsters.

The holiday of Halloween,
_ however, did not originate with little
kids dressed in costumes running from
door to door asking for candy. It all
, Started more than 2,000 years ago in
what are now France and the British
isles. The celtic people held a festival
once a year to please their Lord of the
Dead. The Celtic priests burned peo-
ple alive, usually prisoners of war or
criminals, to pacify the Lord of the
Dead.

This also was a joyful time because
it meant the death of the old year and
the birth of a new. The harvest was
done and people celebrated the sun
, god, Baal, who had given them the
safely stored ripened grain.

In the first century before Christ,
the Romans invaded the Celts’ home-
land and extended the rule of the
Roman empire. The Romans also had
a festival for the dead and gradually

the two festivals became one. The
* Roman rulers were furious about the
« Celtic influence so they banned Celtic
practices. The Celts preserved their
traditions, though, and when Chris-
tianity entered the empire, the Chris-

>~

tian religion gave new meanings and
, ames to the Celts’ customs while not

obliterating them. The Celts believed
i the fire rites they had once held for the
_ Lord of the Dead would now protect
‘ them from the Devil, the enemy of the
( Christian church.

o

\ The 7th century saw the estab-
lishment of All Saints Day in May,
“although by the year 900 it was cele-
{brated on Nov. 1. The Celts still
,awaited the arrival of ghosts on Oct.
31, and they trembled in fear at any
\unusual sounds. And they still cele-
brated the tradition of ancient harvest
‘rituals by feasting and playing games.

The many holidays, All Saint’s Day
sand All Hallow’s Even, eventually
, merged into the one Halloween on
‘Oct. 31. The Scotch and Irish brought
cit to the United States in the 19th cen-
tury, complete with the Halloween
‘witch and cat, devils, ghosts and de-
(mons.

; Halloween is not just a time to get

* lots of candy; it originated from peo-

ple celebrating their harvest and hon-
,oring their dead. The black and or-
ange colors we traditionally recognize
‘as Halloween’s were derived from
harvest colors.

People started wearing masks in
Europe long after all the holidays had
‘merged into Halloween. They wanted
to be unrecognizable, just in case a
* ghost might want to get them. Until a
i few decades ago, boys and girls dres-
sed up as ghosts to scare the neigh-
bors, but no one went ‘‘trick or treat-
» ing.””

» About 40 years ago, neighbors be-
_ gan giving treats to their costumed
‘ visitors. Each Halloween thereafter,

_ Martians, and then clowns began to
appear on doorsteps on Oct. 31. Thus,

_ know it today!

social occasions and learned how to
get things done in the world. Even to-
day a high percentage of male students
(80 percent) belong and much of our
social life revolves around the houses.
They are, on balance, worth saving,
as much for their past utility and im-
portance as for their promise.”’

At the foundation of the renaissance
program is a set of ‘*Standards for
Fraternities’’ adopted by the univer-
sity last year. The standards set forth
operating guidelines that define the
privileges and responsibilities of the
fraternity houses. They also specify
the physical standards to be met for
the interior and exterior condition of
the houses. The standards are manda-
tory and not optional guidelines. All
fraternities must be in full compliance
with the standards to be eligible to par-
ticipate in the renaissance program.

Acting University President John
Elrod said that the project has resulted
in the fraternities and the administra-
tion ‘‘pulling in the same direction.”’

**We should have it all down in two
to three months,’’ he said. Continu-

ing, Dean Elrod said he hoped the
renaissance project would ‘‘help
fraternities be better neighbors to each
other and the Lexington community,
restore the fraternities to what they
were intended to be and make the
houses more pleasing to look at.’’

According to Dean of Students
Lewis John, all fraternities were re-
quired to be in compliance with all but
the house physical standards by Sept.
15. He said when house renovations
are complete, the fraternities must
maintain the standards required in the
**Standards for Fraternities. ”’

Under the program approved by the
board of trustees, the university will
advance financing for the renovation
of the 17 fraternity houses. The
money will be returned to the univer-
sity over a period of time through
alumni gifts, rental payments and
Greek system student fees. The fi-
nancing program is not mandatory, so
any fraternity wanting to do its own
renovations is free to do so. However,
all fraternities—whether or not they
participate in the university's financ-

ing program— —must adhere to the uni-
versity’s ‘‘Standards for Fraterni-
ties,’ including requirements calling
for the physical renovation of the
fraternity houses.

According to Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’
Atkins, dean of greek affairs, all but
one fraternity are qualified to partici-
pate in the program if they choose.
But Dean Atkins said once that frater-
nity’s paperwork is turned in, it will
also be eligible to participate in the
renaissance project.

According to the plan, if a fraternity
applies for university financing, the ti-
tle for the fraternity house must be
deeded to the university. In return, the
university will absorb all current
mortgage balances and will manage
the renovations. W&L already owns
three fraternity houses, Chi Psi, Kap-
pa Sig and Sigma Nu, as well as the
land on which many of the houses are
situated, such as fraternities in Red
Square. Alumni corporations own the
Figi, Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Phi
Epsilon houses.

Once renovated, fraternity houses

Professor Alty, Amy Lehr, Esther Huffman, sary Hampson and Mary Alice McMorrow answer questions at the
Monday night discussion about sororities in Lee Chapel. A final decision on whether or not sororities will colonize at

WA&L will be made within the next 2

months.

Sororities still discussed

by Heather Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

A last discussion on the advan-
tages and disadvantages of sororities
was held Monday night in Lee
Chapel. The surveys handed in by the
women after the forum will decide
whether or not sororities will begin to
colonize this year at W&L.

A panel of two pro-sorority and two
anti-sorority individuals was headed
by senior Esther Huffman in order for
the female students to hear and ex-
press their own opinions on the issue
of sororities.

Some students felt that bringing
sororities to the W&L campus would
be a good solution to the problem of a
lack of social outlet that they feel is
not affecting W&L women.

“*T was led to believe when I was
accepted that we could have what we
(the women) wanted — we could have
sororities ae -if. we wanted

them. I don’t think TRIDENT is ca-
pable of running the school any-
more,’’ said one senior.

As to the matter of whether or not
sororities would be a break in the tra-
dition at W&L, senior Stephanie
Smith said, ‘‘Who does this tradition
belong to? We are the tradition. You
(the women) aren’t lucky to be here—
you're here because you deserve it.
It’s time to stand up for yourself.”’

On the other hand, the basic consen-
sus of many of the women were feel-
ings of concern that they were being
rushed into an idea they weren’t ade-
quately prepared for.

One male in the audience pointed
out that the women ‘‘had a lot of in-
formation to digest. I can see that the
girls obviously need a social outlet,
but I don’t think you should jump into
something and have it fail; it might de-
triment the women’s movement for
the future.’’

Many of the women’s concerns,

‘*We (the United States) can’t af-
ford to forget the concerns of the Anti-
Federalists,"’ said U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
in her lecture in Lee Chapel last
Thursday night.

She explained that the Anti-
Federalists were mostly farmers from
the western United States who argued
against the absence of a bill of rights.
They also argued that the federal
government would become too power-
ful and the states would become
powerless if the Constitution were ra-
tified.

O'Connor agreed, saying that the
answers to many problems lie in state
legislatures, not in Washington, BC;

In recent cases, such as Minneapolis
Star and Tribune Company v. Minne-
sota Commissioner of Revenue, the
U.S. Supreme Court has supported
the concerns that the Anti-Federalists
had, according to O'Connor. In this
case, the court declared it unconstitu

+A meee Nettle coe

tional to impose a tax (on paper and
ink) to restrict the freedom of the
press.

Keeping strong state governments
alongside a strong federal government
proved to be the perfect mix that ena-
bled the United States constitution to
be ratified and last for 200 years.

O'Connor spoke as the third Eli-
zabeth Lewis Otey lecturer, an annual
lecture that brings women of a-
chievement to the university.

O'Connor fits in this category since
she is the only woman to serve on the
highest court in the land. Through her
concurring and dissenting opinions,
she has helped to shape the laws that
govern the United States.

O'Connor has been an associate jus-
tice of the U.S. Supreme Court since
1981.

The day after her lecture, the
58-year-old O'Connor had breast can-
cer surgery at Georgetown University
Hospital. A Supreme Court spokes
woman said last week that O’Connor
is expected to make a “‘total recove
ry’ and should return to the bench by
the end of the month.

such as the amount of time and money
involved with sororities, are problems
that could be solved through further
education.

“If we have sororities now, there
would be a lot of confusion and tur-
moil. There are still too many girls
opposed to sororities,’’ said one soph-
omore.

One of the major concerns was sor-
orities breaking up the women at
W&L and turning them toward a ser-
ies of cliques.

Senior Class President Fray
McCormick told the women they
needed ‘‘to give themselves some cre-
dit. Sororities are not like beautiful,
idiotic girls here and cows over there.
You're selling yourselves short — I
have a lot of faith in the W&L girls.
You could use the Greek system —
you could use it to your advantage.”’

The surveys are now being tablu-
lated, and a decision on when and if
sororities will be coming to the W&L
campus will be made within the next
two months.

will be leased back to the house cor-
poration—a group of alumni who
Oversee the operation of the
house—with specific requirements for
maintenance and operation.

Other features of the program in-
clude:

~The university will provide prop-
erty insurance, maintenance, utilities
and custodial care.

—A portion of the lease/contract be-
tween the house and the university
will be directed to a repair and re-
placement reserve.

—Noncompliance at any time with

the ‘‘Standards for Fraternities’’ will
be cause for termination of the
lease/contract.

—A resident manager with specific
responsibilities will be required.

Dean Elrod said the university is
hoping to begin house renovations as
early as this summer, although re-
quired architectural planning and es-
sential clearances with the City of
Lexington could delay modifications
until a later period.

According to Dean John, four or
five houses could be renovated each

Executive

summer. However, the — selection
process is still undecided. He said the
renovation steering committee may
take applications on a first come, first
serve basis or by cluster—Red Square
or Washington Street houses

The renovation steering committee,

made up of students and members of
the administration, will meet on Nov.
11 to decide on specifics, such as the
applications procedure, Dean John
said. He also said the Alumni Frater
nity Council and house corporation
presidents will meet Nov. 19 to ex
plain procedures to individual chap
ters and discuss whether or not chap
ters want to apply for participation in
the program.

A project supervisor will be hired to
oversee the renaissance program.
That supervisor's responsibilities will
include working with the renovation
steering committee, the dean of stu-
dent’s office, the individual house
corporations and fraternity chapter
officers to oversee the development of
individual house plans as eligible
houses apply.

Notes:

No more flyers on colonnade

 

By Stacy Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

Flyers will no longer be permitted
to be posted on the colonnade after a
motion made by the Executive Com-
mittee at its Monday night meeting is
approved by the deans, said First-
Year Law EC Representative Mark A.
Cobb.

Cobb reported that Dean of Students
Lewis G. John wants ‘‘to get the
flyers off the columns and the fronts
of the buildings on the colonnade.”’
Cobb spoke to Dean John last week in
response to a request EC President
Christopher deMovellan received
from Senior David Burns.

Burns said the posters ‘‘detract’’
from the colonnade’s beauty, and
since the colonnade is a_ national
landmark, the flyers should go on the
campus bulletin boards.

Cobb said Dean John suggested
several options, such as more bulletin
boards on campus, or having a work
study student pull down outdated
flyers from the buildings. Buildings
and Grounds already removes posters
hung on the columns and doors.

DeMovellan said he wanted to see
all flyers completely off the colon-
nade. But, he said, ‘‘The question is,
where is the stuff going to go?”’

There are currently four bulletin
boards on campus. They are located in
front of the Co-op, behind Payne Hall,
in front of DuPont Hall, and in the
Graham-Lees Dormitory archway.
Cobb said students are allowed to post
flyers on the bulletin boards inside
each of the buildings on the colonnade
as well.

Sophomore EC Representative Wil-
lard Dumas suggested an additional
bulletin board be installed outside the
library, because there is such heavy
traffic there.

Cobb is drafting a letter stating that
posters are to be hung only on bulletin
boards. He will present the letter at
the next EC meeting on Monday
night.

In other business, deMovellan re-
ported on his meeting with the W&L
Board of Trustees last weekend. He

Library reports
missing books
and articles

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

Missing books, jackets, calculators
and back packs do not surprise the
WAL librarian.

Students have reported missing arti-
cles from study carrels in the library
as well as the Commerce School li-
brary. Circulation librarian Peggy
Hayes said, ‘‘It seems to happen
spurts."’ The recent complaints are
not new to the librarians.

Since W&L leaves the library and
the academic buildings on campus
open 24-hours-a-day, it is difficult to
monitor who comes in and out of the
buildings. Because the library is a de
pository library, one that receives fed
eral documents for free, it must be ac
cessible to the public in this con
gressional district in addition to stu
dents.

‘Students need to take the honor
code seriously at all times, not just
when they are taking an exam. Regret
fully, we suspect students, as well as
outsiders, for the missing articles,”
Hayes said.

Security patrols have been increased
in the library in the evenings and at
times when there is less activity in the
building. Hayes commented that stu
dents do not help the situation by
propping doors open on the library's
lower levels

Homework, papers and books have
been reported missing in the C-School

library, said

Anne Ziegler, secretary
to Dean Larry C. Peppers of the
C-School. ‘‘It seemed to st: art last year
around the time of exams,” Ziegler

said

Get

InShape!

The average American is in poor physical condition. Extensive
media coverage of the ‘‘fitness boom’’ is enough to make it seem
. otherwise, but this fact is undeniable. While a small majority of
‘ elite athletes have used modern training and equipment to attain
amazing levels of fitness, most people have moved in the opposite
direction. The days when humans stayed in physical shape by using
their hands and feet to hunt and gather food, to build shelter and to
entertain themselves are gone. Today, a person with a sedentary
* job, a car, and a television can easily survive without physical acti-
vity. Of course, there is more to health than physical activity. Eat-
ing, sleeping, drinking and smoking habits, in addition to stress, are
also important variables.
By these standards, college students are very unhealthy. Few
“ exercise regularly and college is very conducive to the development
. of poor eating habits. Most college students sleep erratically and

many drink and

smoke excessively. The academic pressures and

change of lifestyle inherent to most campus environments make col-

lege very stressful.

If so many unhealthy people function in society, then what's the
point of exercising and living right? For one, it will increase your
life span. A long term study of Harvard alumni reported by the New
York Times in 1986 showed that ‘‘men who walked nine or more

_miles per week had a 21 percent lower risk of death than men who
_ walked less than three miles.’’ It also showed that the least active of
the older alumni are twice as likely to die as their very active

counterparts.
A Soviet study

reported by the United Press International blames

the low life expectancy rates of Soviet citizens on the fact that ‘‘less
than one-third of the population exercises regularly, 30 percent are
overweight, 70 million smoke, and heavy drinking is common.”’
There are twice as many fatal heart attacks in the Soviet Union as
-there are in Western European capitalist countries.

Besides increasing the length of life, a healthy lifestyle increases
the quality of life. Strenuous or even moderate exercise is a great
.way to relieve stress. Many fitness lovers put exercise on a spiritual

level. Exercise related body fatigue is a great way to relax the mind.
A regular exercise program will do more for most people than any

drastic change in

personal philosophy. A conditioned body is a de-

served source of self esteem and respect. Exercise is for everyone.
If you are not doing it on a regular schedule, I encourage you to
start. Find a sport or an exercise you enjoy and do it regularly. Start
slow and make sure it’s fun. The results will amaze you.

MY VIEW
By Elisabeth Fowler

 

I would like to begin by compli-
menting the Sorority Advisory Com-
mittee as a whole on the idea of hold-
ing an open forum. In addition to clar-
ifying the winter rush rumor (they will
only have winter rush if there is suffi-
cient interest, especially in the under-
classes), it allowed some of us — who
have been filling out ‘‘sorority inter-
est’’ questionnaires for four years and
are beginning to doubt anyone is
listening — to state our opinions. I
would also like to extend special
kudos to Esther Huffman who did an
excellent job as chairman (chairwo-
man, chairperson — take your pick).

The purpose of this letter is not to
debate the pros and cons of the soror-
ity issue (I will not even say which
side I support), but rather to question
the qualifications of some of those
who were chosen to sit on the panel —
specifically Professor Alty and Amy
Lehr. I would like to emphasize that
this is not a personal attack — I am
sure Ms. Alty and Ms. Lehr are per-
fectly wonderful individuals — I sim-
ply feel that they were completely un-
qualified to address the issue of sorori-
ties at Washington and Lee.

At the beginning of the forum each

. Funding for The Ringtom Phi

By Beckwith Archer

 

In the ongoing debate concerning
sororities at our school, I am of the
opinion that they should not be insti-
tuted at Washington and Lee. I am a
transfer student from the University of
Kentucky. I was a member of the Del-
ta Rho chapter of Delta Delta Delta,
and I am aware of the pros and cons
concerning sorority life.

Sororities are an important part of
the social life at a major university.
The enrollment of UK was 23,500
students as compared with W&L’s
1,600.

Through the sorority I became
friends with girls whom I probably
would not have ever seen on campus
in the four-year period that 1 was
there. We did a lot of things together
and were an entity unto ourselves. In
that sense, I suppose that the sorority
life offered a feeling of security. I al-
ways felt I had a place where I be-
longed. It was a home away from
home.

There are negative aspects,
however, which on the W&L campus
outweigh the positive ones. Sorority
rush is one of the most humiliating and
frustrating experiences for a freshman

 

 

member of the panel introduced them-
selves and explained why they were
chosen for the panel. Prof. Altyes qua-
lifications were simply that she had
been in a sorority in @bllegé "and
thought they would be a good thing to
start at W&L. My question is is: what
does a first year professor really know
about student life at W&L? Was she
here when W&L was all male? Was
she even here during the first few
years of The Great Female Infiltra-
tion? No. Then how can she possibly
understand the impact that sororities
would have on both the social life at
WA&L and on alumni relations? The is-
sue is not ‘‘are sororites a neatsy-keen
idea’’ but whether they are right for
WA&L, and/or are they right for W&L
at this time. She had little more to con-
tribute than a speech on how swell
sororities can be.

Amy Lehr was similarly unquali-
fied. Her ‘‘qualifications’’ were based
on the fact that she had been a member
of a sorority at Vanderbilt. (For those
who do not know, Ms. Lehr is a junior
transfer this year.) Again, her main
contribution to the forum was that she
loved being in a sorority and, gee
whiz, they were such fun. Forgive me
for saying this, but SO WHAT. That
does not prove that they are the right
thing for Washington and Lee. In-
deed, how can someone who has been
a student at W&L for less then two
months judge the effects a sorority

woman. Instead of being able to get
onto a campus and make a name for
yourself, you are immediately judged
by a group of women who know noth-
ing about you as a person.

From the rusher’s side, the situation
is even worse. We were expected to
sit and talk with a girl for 20 minutes
and based on that meeting, make a de-
cision that might affect her entire ex-
perience at the university.

This is a very traumatic time for
both the sororities and the rushees.
The former being torn between
hypocrisy and truth, and the latter try-
ing desperately to understand why
they were not accepted to the sorority
of their choice.

At a university the size of UK this
situation was aided by the sheer enor-
mity of the school. We found solace in
the fact that if we were lucky, we
would never have to see the girls that
we had excluded. The institution of
Washington and Lee does not foster
any of these attitudes. Hypocrisy and
avoidance are two evils that this uni-
versity seeks, through its teachings, to
eradicate.

Many argue that there is sisterhood
in sorority life, and to an extent this is
true. However, in reality, I feel that
this is a facade. The bonds exist sim-
ply because you wear the same letters.
Real sisterhood develops only from
true friendships. I also regret the

Co-ed Questions Committee

system would have here?

Having two such unqualified people
speak out for sororities only managed
to weaken the pro-sorority argument.
As a result, many persons who went to
the forum undecided to uninformed
left indisputably against a sorority
system at W&L. I do not think the
fault lies with the individuals (Ms.
Alty and Ms. Lehr) themselves, but
rather with whomever chose the panel
for the forum. Surely the organizer
could have found two women from the
senior or junior class, or even a guy,
who were more qualified to judge how
sororities would affect W&L and
whether the good effects would ou-
tweigh the bad ones. A student, for
example, who was around when the
move to co-education took place and
perhaps had some insight into the
changes (either through having
‘‘lived’’ through them, or because of
special alumni connections, which
enabled them to have known the ‘‘old
W&L’’). I know many such students
exist both in the senior class and the
junior class. If nothing else, they
would have been able to talk from
some basis of W&L experience. Such
a person’s opinions would have been
taken seriously and they would have
strengthened, rather than weakened,
the argument for sororities at W&L.

Again, I would like to compliment
the Sorority Advisory Committee on a
job, otherwise, well done.

many friendships that I missed out on
simply because the tri-Deltas were not
supposed to socialize with the Thetas
or the Kappas.

The list of baseless innuendos and
vicious rumors that spread among the
sororities was ridiculous. It is naive to
think that this sort of thing won’t hap-
pen at Washington and Lee should
sororities be instated. Many girls are
hurt and bitter about the rush process
and every sorority wants to be thought
of as the superior one. The backstab-
bing is inevitable.

I would also argue that there already
is a sisterhood at this university. We
are the women of Washington and
Lee. We have been brave enough to
come into a male-dominated institu-
tion, and I believe that we have estab-
lished ourselves very well. We have
seen a lot of changes in four years, not
the least of which is that we have been
accepted on campus and in the class-
room.

A sorority system on this campus
would cause a schism that would be ir-
reparable. The girls would become
divided and some would inevitably
have a feeling of superiority over oth-
ers. The clique situation would wor-
sen dramatically with girls associating
primarily with those in their same sor-
ority. I realize that there are several

A Great
Debate |

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

 

In a very dangerous area of a big,
city in the middle of the night, the
Hell's Angels and the Better Business
Bureau threw a party. As motorcycle
maniacs and embezzling economists
settled down to a night of dangerous
drugs and wild women, a perceptive
participant made a stunning realiza-
tion. The two presidential candidates,
in addition to their vice presidential
nominees happened to be at this same
party. After some skillful lobbying
and threats of violence, the candidates
agreed to a debate. In order to give the
debate some degree of realism, two
brain dead members of the crowd
were chosen as panelists. As usual, f
happened to be in the right place at the
right time and recorded the entire de-
bate on the tape recorder I just hap“
pened to be holding. }

Question 1; From Mr. Rockhead,
a member of the Omaha Chapter of
the Hell’s Angels: Governor Duka
kis, if I ran over Kitty's face with my
Harley, raped her, and then cut her up
into little pieces and served her as an
h’ors d’oeuvre, would you recom-
mend giving me the death penalty?

Dukakis: No, I wouldn't. There are,
more effective ways of dealing with
criminals. I would revoke your
motorcycle license and put you on
probation. That way you might be’
able to reform and someday join the,
ACLU.

Mr. Rockhead:' Mr. Bush, what
would you do if I did the same thing to,
your wife?

Bush: I'd cut your heart out with a
machete before you even had a trial, ;
and I'd torture every living member of
your family by blocking their blood’
vessels with super glue.

Question 3, from Mr. Waffleface,’
senior partner at Waffleface and,
Son Accounting Firm: Senator
Quayle, if you had to be a garden‘
vegetable, which one would you be,
and why?

Quayle: Well, it’s funny you ask, :
but just the other day my 97-year-old.
grandmother told me I looked and ac-
ted like a rutabaga she planted as a‘
child. I would be a rutabaga because
Grandma says they can cure hemorr-
hoids and I have always been inter-;
ested in medicine.

Mr. Waffleface: Senator Bentsen, ,
do you believe in God?

Bentsen: Actually, Mr. Waffleface,
I worship the devil. I’ve found that Sa- ,
tan knows a h=ll of a lot about politics.
I realize that my religious beliefs may‘
seem to be at odds with Dukakis who
is a Zen Buddhist, but, remember, re-"
ligious tolerance is in the first.
amendment. °

Question 5, from Mr. Rockhead: ;
Senator Quayle, what was the most
recent book you read and what did it ’
teach you? '

Quayle: Three months ago I read
The Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss. It '
taught me that the anarchist society ,
advocated by the cat will only work
with the help of a strong military. '

Mr. Rockhead: What about your
favorite book, Senator Bentsen?

Bentsen: Unfortunately, I am one ;
of the 20 million functionally illiterate
Americans. :

Question 7 from Mr. Waffleface:
Mr. Bush, why is it so important that !
our children say the Pledge of Alle-
giance?

Bush: It is the only thing separating -
us from Communist countries: like |
Bulgaria.

Question 8 from Mr. Waffleface: ,
Governor Dukakis, how tall are you?

Dukakis: I’m 5°4°’, but Kitty thinks »
I may still be growing, just like Amer-
ica will grow under a Democratic ;
president.

Question 9 from Mr. Rockhead: ‘
Senator Quayle, aren't you a little |
young to be a vice president? I mean,
you don’t even have Alzheimer's '
Disease.

Quayle: Personally, I think good
presidents can be effective even if they ”
don’t have a disability.

‘

Question 10 from Mr. Rockhead: \
Senator Bentsen, if Dukakis became
president and was killed after being ‘
shot by Iranian terrorists, what steps ,
would you take as the new president?

Bentsen: Let's see. I'd probably
order a pizza with onions and extra
cheese. I'd also move my stereo into
the oval office and crank up some Led |
Zeppelin. And then I'd probably run,
through the White House wearing
nothing but a Stetson cowboy hat.

At this point, the debate was inter-
rupted permanently by irate members
of the crowd who began throwing

Wa&L may just be
in the movies

by Betsy Griffin
Staff Reporter

 

This summer, Washington and
Lee was considered as a possible site
for the production of a Walt Disney
film titled, ‘‘The Dead Poets’ So
ciety.
The stars Robin Williams
(’Moscow on the Hudson’’ and
“Good Morning Vietnam’’) and is
directed by Peter Weir (‘‘Wit-
ness’’and *‘The Year of Living Dang-
erously’’). It concerns a writer (Wil-
liams) who returns to his all-male prep
school to teach. When he was a stu
dent, he organized the ‘*‘Dead Poets’
Society’’ to read and study poets’
works. He is asked to reorganize the
society when he returns.
This summer, representatives from
the Virginia Film Office, which en-
couraged filmmakers to produce films
, in Virginia, examined several cam-

puses across the state as possible sites
» for the movie. They also visited Mary
, Baldwin College, University of Vir-
‘ ginia, Hollins College, Roanoke Col-
\lege and the preparatory schools:

Stuart Hall, the Miller School and the
‘ Madeira School.

Representatives from the Virginia
Film Office and Walt Disney Pictures
‘spent six hours looking at W&L on
July 24. They were looking for a cam-
pus that was “‘striking architectural-

movie

They also were looking for class-
rooms that were typical of the late
1950s, such as the ones in Robinson
Hall. They also examined Lee Chapel
and Evans Dining Hall. The rep-
resentatives who visited were ‘‘very
impressed’’ and thought W&L was
the best of all the places they had
visited.

In early September, Peter Weir and
five representatives from Walt Disney
visited for about three hours. Weir felt
that W&L was too large to give the
appearance of a 300-student prep
school. They decided to film the mo-
vie at St. Andrews School in Delaw-
are.

W&L, however, will continue to be
considered as a possible location for
motion pictures. W&L News Office
Director Brian Shaw said, “‘It is the
university’s policy to cooperate as
much as we can with the film office.’’
Shaw also said the filming of a movie
at W&L ‘‘would be an educational
experience. Both the presence of a
movie crew on campus and the possi-
bility of participating in the produc-
tion, would be beneficial to W&L stu-
dents.””

There has been discussion of film-
ing ‘‘The Foreign Student,’’ based on
Philippe Labro’s book. The Thom
Mont Company, which produced
‘*Bull Durham’’ purchased the film
rights to Labro’s book. However, no
contracts have been made concerning
the film site.

Life in the Fast Lane

by Debbie Grove
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Fast Lane, Lexington’s new
bowling alley, is doing ‘‘extremely
well,’ according to Wayne Heslep,
‘president of Lois Lanes Inc., which
owns the alley. He added, ‘‘The re-
‘sponse has been extremely good —
‘way ahead of all our projections.’

The Fast Lane is located on U.S. 11

. North, one mile past the intersection
of 11 and interstate 64. Heslep said
there currently are 16 lanes, but 8 to
10 more lanes may be added this
\spring. The facility boasts a game
room, snack bar and computerized
‘scoring of the games.

Heslep said the bowling alley is
successful because ‘‘there are not
many things to do around here.
‘Bowling is something just about
anyone can do, it’s inexpensive and
it’s fun.”’

He said over the years there has
been an effort vy a number of people
‘

 

to build a bowling alley, but because
of financial difficulties, the idea never
go past the drawing board.

The Fast Lanes’ manager, Butch
McClamma, said The Fast Lane is
open from noon until midnight Mon-
day through Thursday and noon until
2 a.m. on Fridays. On Fridays,
McClamma said there is a special
“moonlight bowling’’ during which
the lights are turned off. On Satur-
days, The Fast Lane is open from 9
a.m. to 1 a.m., and Sundays it’s open
from noon until midnight.

Because of the formation of bowling
leagues, McClamma said the hours
for open bowling are from noon until
5 p.m. every day. All day Wednesday
and Saturday after 3 p.m. are open, as
well as Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Friday and Sunday evenings after
9:30.

Bowling costs $1.50 per person, per
game from noon until 5 p.m., and
$1.85 after 5 p.m. Shoe rental is 95
cents at all times

 

 

 

 

 

  

“Do any of you have a drinking
problem? Raise your hand.’’... No
one raises their hand. ‘‘Has anyone
ever thrown up drinking before?
Raise your hand.’’... Three-fourths
of the people raise their hand. ‘‘Do
any of you have a drinking prob-
lem?’’... Everyone has a puzzled
look. ‘‘I consider throwing up a
problem. Do you?’’... Everyone

laughs...

On Friday, Oct. 21, this dialogue in
Lee Chapel between Mike Green and
the audience began the discussion of
alcohol abuse. Green’s message to the
W&L community and the 10 other
schools he visited during the National
Collegiate Alcohol Awareness Week
was one of moderation and safety.
Although his message ‘was intended to
educate, it did not dictate. As one stu-
dent, Mike Malloy, said, ‘‘He was on
the level of the students. He talked

with you, not at you.”’

Also atypical of alcohol programs,
Green did not suggest that students
stop drinking altogether, and even
admitted that some of his best times
with college football ‘‘buddies’’ were
spent drinking. However, as a re-
covering alcoholic, he did stress that
drinking can get out of hand and he
was speaking to pass on some tips on
how not to let drinking become a prob-
lem. He said, *‘I don’t want anyone to
have to go through what I went
through.’’ Another student, Allen
Ferguson, said, ‘‘It was neat how his
emphasis was on how to drink, not
how not to drink.”’

Green’s first tip was not to succumb
to the ‘‘power of suggestion.”’ Stu-
dents shouldn’t let roommates or
friends con them into believing they
need a drink. Drinking to mask prob-
lems or recover from a hard day is
probably the worst time for us to
drink, Green said.

Green's second tip was not to sur-
render to peer pressure. Although stu-
dents might not think that peer pres-
sure is a ‘‘big deal,”’ all it takes is one

g up a problem?

person at a party to start yelling
“‘chug’’ and then everyone starts yell-

ing ‘‘chug’? and so
**chugs.”’

Green’s third tip was to avoid the
“*gets.’’ He asked how anyone could
enjoy a feeling that is described as tra-
shed, hammered, fried, s.faced, and

that person

‘f'dup.

The final words of advice that
Green left were on the 2-H.A.L.T.
TIPS that are part of a promotional
t-shirt for the Philadelphia Flyers.

First, drink only two drinks per
hour, a drink being a 12-oz. can of
beer, a 3-oz. glass of wine, or a mixed
shot. The body can neutralize one
drink per hour and the second drink
may give you a nice ‘‘buzz,”’ but at
least it’s out of the .01 legal intoxica-
tion range. Also, avoid drinking if you
are hungry; it will make you Hungrier
and Heavier. Don’t drink when you’ re
Angry or Lonely because your emo-
tions are intensified and you may
either hurt yourself or someone else.
And don’t drink when you’ re Tired.

Gladys Steele and her shelter for the
homeless prepare for the winter months

Staff Reporter

 

Coming up on its third winter, Gla-
dys House Inc., on Varner Lane,
opens for the homeless Nov. |. This
year the shelter is again seeking assis-
tance from volunteers, such as church
groups, students and local individuals.
Gladys Steele, who operates the shel-
ter out of her home, says her house is
open to anyone who comes.

The shelter operation provides the
homeless with two meals a day.
Church groups have been the main
providers of the evening hot meal and
breakfast funds have been provided by
the shelter committee. Night vol-
unteers stay overnight in the shelter to
answer the door and enforce the rules.
According to John Hall, a W&L law
student and volunteer coordinator,
‘*The commitment of a volunteer isn’t
very substantial and the experience is
worthwhile and rewarding.”’

In the winter months, the commun-
ity has been the main source of dona-
tions to the shelter. During the sum-

mer months, Steele has maintained the
shelter, using her own money and
energy to provide for those in need.
She said, ‘‘I don’t think the commun-
ity is aware that there are as many
homeless in the summer as in the win-
ter. I try to do the best I can, but it is
hard going it alone, relying on my
own limited energy and finances.’

The shelter rules prohibit alcohol,
weapons, violence and smoking up-
stairs. Those persons desiring to eat
must be in the shelter by 5 p.m. to
receive a hot meal and lights are out at
11 p.m. The homeless are expected to
be out of the shelter by the time the
volunteer leaves in the morning;
however, when the weather is cold,
there is no set time one must leave.
Steele said she has never had a prob-
lem with people defying the rules.

The shelter consists of two large
rooms upstairs, a bathroom and a
small sitting area for meals and telev-
ision. The shelter can hold 10 people
comfortably, but Steele has allowed
19 to stay the night. Cots are provided
by Virginia Military Institute and
VMI staffs the program every Satur-

 

TALKBACK

   

day, according to Steele.

Hall said that on a national scale,
the majority of homeless suffer from
substance abuse or mental illness.
Hall, involved with shelters for six
years, said, ‘‘I’ve never run across a
person who wasn’t grateful, kind or
who I couldn’t be a friend to.’’ He
also said that the committee is looking
for people who are interested in help-
ing, especially student volunteers will-
ing to spend the night.

In the near future, the committee
hopes to build a new shelter. Presen-
tly, the committee possesses property
on Moore Street, but does not have the
money to build a shelter. Steele hopes
to pool together W&L resources in
order to sponsor a fund drive. She
said, ‘‘I hope W&L will contribute to
this cause because the university is so
good with fundraising.’’ In addition,
Steele said her house will only last one
more winter due to its age. Thus, the
new shelter may become a necessity.

Steele said last year she and her
family fed 30 people on Thanksgiv-
ing. She loves the service she provides
and feels since God supports her, all
the work is worthwhile.

Sororities

 

(continued from page 2)

groups already on campus that are
fairly exclusive, yet sororities will
only enhance that situation. There is
also a problem with the fraternities.
Do not think that once there are soror-
ities that our days of freedom to attend
any fraternity party will continue. The
fraternities will invite one or two of
the sororities at a time to the house for
parties, and although other girls may
be allowed to attend, it is not a lot of
fun to go to a party where others know
that you were not invited.

I also have heard the argument that
life is not fair and that every situation
we encounter from now on will not
necessarily be pleasant. My counter to
this statement would be why, if life is
definitely going to deal us harsh
blows, should we subject ourselves to
self-imposed inequalities? University
life is not reality and it is pointless for
us to try to argue that it is or that we
should make it so.

As an alternative to the sororities, I
would advocate eating clubs for
women, common among Ivy League
universities. The girls would be free
to go and sign up in a house where
they feel the most comfortable, and
with the girls whom they believe that
they have the most in common. Much
of the dissention and anger could be
avoided in this way.

Washington and Lee is a very small
school. I believe part of its charm lies
in its size and the cohesiveness of the
student body. We are a sorority unto
ourselves, and there are not enough
women at this school for us to allow
this controversy to cause dissention.
The fact that the body of female stu-
Cents is so torn over this issue should
be an indicator that this is not the time
for the institition of sororities at
Washington and Lee. At a big univer-
sity, identity is based on your Greek
letters. The only letters that the
women of this school need are W and

City Hall makes
a new proposal

By Cindy Phoa
Staff Reporter

 

Lexington City Council submitted a
proposal to the Rockbridge County
Board of Supervisors to consolidate
the city and county government of-
fices by renovating and adding to the
existing county offices in Courthouse
Square on West Main Street.

The proposed ‘‘Rockbridge Area
Court and Office Complex’ would
provide badly needed court facilities
for both governments and administra-
tive office spaces for the county.

The city based its proposal on the
belief that only with cooperative
efforts could the governments of Lex-
ington and Rockbridge County, ac-
cording to the new City Hall proposal,
“‘maintain efficient government oper-
ations and enhance quality of life for
all area residents."’ City officials be-
lieve their proposal to be more benefi-
cial than the considerations by the
County Board of Supervisors to con-
struct new facilities near the regional
jail; they believe, despite difficulties
in developing the downtown area, the
offices need to be maintained in their
historic location.

Courthouse Square has been the site
of Rockbridge County government for
nearly 200 years, and the city’s plans
would preserve the square and the

Sprunt exhibits art

 

Staff Report

 

More than 50 recent paintings and
drawings of local artist Elise Sprunt
will be on exhibit in the Conference
Room Gallery of Washington and Lee
University’s Commerce School from
Nov. 5 to Dec. 31.

Sprunt’s paintings over the past 30

Marshall Kirkland **Kirk’’ Follo, a
1967 Washington and Lee graduate

far,’’ says Follo. ‘*During registration
at the beginning of the year, more than
180 students signed up for outing club

American Bank and the land behind it
that extends to Randolph Street, then
renovate the existing building to add
on a new addition; the county jail
would also be renovated and connec-
ted to the new extension. A problem
facing the proposal is the lack of ade-
quate parking. City officials,
however, have suggested a plan pro-
viding 160 new and 52 improved park-
ing spaces.

The complex would be owned and
operated by the Industrial De-
velopment Authorities of both the
Lexington and Rockbridge County
governments, and the IDA would
reimburse their investment by leasing
the office space at sufficient rates to
recover initial expenditures, and to
maintain and operate the buildings.

The cost of renovations is estimated
at over $3.1 million, and an annual
collection of approximately $3000
would be needed to adequately cover
costs. Therefore, the residents of the
complex, the city, the county and First
American Bank, would be expected to
pay $8.44 per square foot leased each
year.

Lexington’s annual expense is esti-
mated at $122,887 per year, and
Rockbridge County would be expec-
ted to pay $164,842 per year.

City manager Joseph King said
plans have not solidified enough to
discuss anything definite, but he said
the building would be suitable for
housing. The proposal made in Au-
gust suggests the space may be made
available for sorority housing.

Academic standards rise

 

by Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

 

It has been four years. Four years
since Washington and Lee became a
co-educational university. Economic
and sociological reasons played a
large role in the co-ed decision.
Within four years, applications and
enrollment have changed, exhibiting
the success of W&L’s academic stan-
dards.

In 1974, the number of enrolled
undergraduates was 1,327. This year
1,608 have enrolled for the 1988-89
academic year. Applications have in-
creased as well. The first year W&L
went co-ed, applications jumped 76
percent. Applicants for the 1987-88
year numbered 3,336, while last year
3,222 applied. According to Dean
John Elrod, the admissions office ac-
cepted 947 in 1988, and 46 to 48 per-
cent usually enroll.

Attention W&L Undergraduate Episcopal Students:

All undergraduate Episcopal students are invited
to meet in the R.E. Lee Church library at 6:00 p.m.

t

After students enroll in the univer-
sity, they may transfer out during their’
four (or five) year education. W&L,,
however, ma‘ntains a high retention
rate. Elrod said, ‘*The retention rate!
has increased quite a bit.’

The 1988 graduating class has a 7
percent retention rate; this year the‘
number is 83 percent. The numbers ,
are even higher for the current soph--
omore and junior classes. The class of }
1990 has an 89 percent retention rate ‘
and the class of 1991 is 96 percent.

Elrod said, ‘‘(It) is interesting that ;
the retention rate has gone up. It is ac-
tually a surprise. Since we had!
planned to open the year up withy
1,500, but 1,608 enrolled.*’

Most applicants are from Virginia, ’
followed by New Jersey and Texas.
The median SAT scores have in-
creased to 590 verbal and 635 math, '
But, higher standards have led to a:
higher academic ranking in Barron’ s
book of colleges.

‘““Boyd’s Boys’’ kicked some butt
Saturday afternoon.

Keyed by the outstanding play of
Washington and Lee’s defensive front
line, the Generals turned in a com-
manding 21-point shutout of Sewanee,
and irascible defensive-line coach
“Boyd Williams, who has been none-
to-fond of the University of the South
for most of his 35 seasons of coaching
Generals’ football, is rumored to have
cracked a smile over the outstanding
play of his ‘‘boys’’ — who played
more like men.

The defense was strong throughout
the game, but the W&L offensive and
special teams did everything they
could to give Sewanee the early lead.
The Generals won the coin toss, and
freshman David Harper took the open-
ing kickoff 15 yards before fumbling
at the W&L 22. But the Tigers failed
tg cash in on the turnover — W&L
sophomore defensive back Clark
Wight picked off a Sewanee pass on
second down to make up for the Har-
per fumble.

‘But the W&L offense would not be
denied its Opportunity to give away
points. Three plays into W&L’s first
drive of the game, Sewanee line-
backer Robert Black intercepted a
pass from junior quarterback Phil
Sampson, and the Tigers took over at

the W&L 37.

The Sewanee offense drove 36
yards in nine plays, despite a sack by
senior defensive tackle Jim Johnson.
Then, with first and goal from the
one, freshman running back Alan
Broom was stopped for no gain. After
a false start on second down cost the
Tigers five yards, running back Mark
Barineau reached the one on a sweep.
But W&L stopped Sewanee for no
gain on two straight plays, and the
Generals took over on downs.

The offense remained stagnant.
After junior fullback Russell Crosby
picked up four yards on first down,
Waskiewicz was stopped for no gain
and Sampson threw an_ incomplete
pass that sent in senior Tom Skeen to
punt out of his own end zone.

The W&L defenders should have
been exhausted by now, but they wer-
en’t. After Sewanee again drove to the
W&L 1, the Generals forced a fumble
by Broom, and senior lineman Hughes
Melton recovered.

After an exchange of punts, the
W&L offense finally came to life.
Starting at their own 22, the Generals
drove to their 45, where sophomore
running back Mason Pope took a han-
doff from junior quarterback Chris
Smythe. Pope, who rushed for 114
yards on 18 carries in the game, cut
left and out-ran the Sewanee defense
for the game’s first touchdown.
Quayle kicked the extra point that
gave the Generals a 7-0 lead — a lead

\In cross country, nothing helps your
team more than grabbing first place.
On Saturday, the Washington and Lee
men’s cross country team received
that as well as an added plus in its
25-30 defeat of Old Dominion Athle-
ti¢ Conference rival Bridgewater.

ft was no surprise to the Generals
when senior co-captain Bill Clark was
fifst to cross the finish line, smoking
Bridgewater's 5-mile course in 27:45,

at was unexpected, however, was
the performance of freshman Lee Par-
ker. Passing two Bridgewater runners
in the final 200 yards, Parker took
sevond place in 28:31 and almost as-
sured the Generals of victory.

‘*He ran well. That was his best
performance of the year,”’ said head
cgach Dick Miller of Parker’s race.

Both he and[freshman | Charles Ed-
wards have come along real well.*’

Edwards, who has been the No. 2
runner for W&L for most of. the
season, had somewhat of an off-day
but still managed to finish fifth in a
tithe of 29:13. Junior Joe Geitner (7th,

29:46) and freshman William Benson
(10th, 30:53) were the other scorers
for the Generals, W&L, 5-3, also
picked up a forfeit victory from West
Virginia Tech.

Miller, considering how far ahead
the Generals finished in front of
Bridgewater at the Virginia State Meet
a week earlier, seemed slightly sur-
prised by the closeness of the meet.

But it was Parker’s impressive kick
that really caught the coach off guard.
**T didn’t think he had enough speed to
do that because he hasn’t shown that
much speed in previous meets,’’ he
said.

The W&L women’s team picked up
a forfeit victory from West Virginia
Tech as well on Saturday, raising its
record to 4- 3.

Next up for the Generals is a trip to
Harrisonburg Saturday for an impor-
tant tri-meet that includes ODAC-foes
Eastern Mennonite and Hampden-
Sydney for the men, and Eastern
Mennonite and Lynchburg for the
women. The meets will be a final
tune-up for both teams before the
ODAC championships on Nov. 5.

they would never relinquish — with
12:02 left in the half.

After fielding Quayle’s kickoff,
Sewanee fumbled on its first play
from scrimmage, and Skeen, playing
linebacker, recovered at the Sewanee
a.

By now, the W&L offense was roll-
ing. Smythe led the Generals on a
nine-play drive and scored from
l-yard out with 7:23 remaining, and
Quayle’s extra point made the score
14-0.

Despite a slow offensive start,
W&L dominated the halftime stats.
The Generals had nearly doubled the
Tigers in total offensive yards
(181-95) through the first two periods
and had limited the Tigers to 41 pass-
ing yards, less than a quarter of their
166.5 yards-per-game average.

The second half saw more of the
same. The Tigers were able to crank
out some offense but crossed the
W&L 20-yard line only once and
never crossed the 15. A 14-yard run
by Pope with 1:43 left in the third
quarter capped a nine-play, 68-yard
drive and put the game out of reach
for good. Quayle kicked the point
after for a 21-0 W&L lead.

The defense held on the rest of the
way. Wight intercepted his second
pass of the day with 13 seconds left,
and it was then that coach Williams
probably thought about smiling. His
‘“‘boys’’ had dominated in W&L’s
second shutout of the season.

Sweet Briar

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

 

The sun finally peeked through the
clouds at the end of Tuesday’s
women’s soccer match between Wash-
ington and Lee and Sweet Briar in the
first-round of the Old Dominion Ath-
letic Conference Tournament. Unfor-
tunately for the Generals, that brief
moment of sunshine turned out to be
the only bright spot during what was a
dark and gloomy afternoon for W&L
up on the Liberty Hall Fields.

Despite dominating the action for
much of the 90-minute contest, the
Generals lost 2-1. It was a game that,
accorting te‘head coach Jan Hathorn,
W&L should have won.

The Generals outshot Sweet Briar
32-6 and had at least four times as
many scoring chances. After a score-
less first half, W&L junior Sarah T.

Allen lofted a shot past Sweet Briar
goalie Keri Chrisman with 43 minutes
remaining in the second half. Con-
sidering the way the Generals were
playing, a one-goal lead probably
looked like five to Sweet Briar.

But the visitors capitalized when
they had the opportunities. Michelle
Lennane, Sweet Briar’s leading
scorer, connected on a direct kick
with 25 minutes left, beating W&L
goalie Sherri Brown with a shot to the
upper right-hand corner of the goal.

Suddenly, overtime seemed a likely
possibility as the Generals peppered
Chrisman with shots but were unable
to find the back of the net.

‘They had an outstanding goalie
today,’’ Hathorn said of Chrisman,
who normally plays a wing positon.

was, I think it would have been a

Men tie top-ranked Macon

 

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

 

It was Wednesday afternoon, and
the Washington and Lee men’s soccer
team was getting ready to play Ran-
dolph-Macon.

Nothing new for the Generals, ex-
cept that Randolph-Macon is ranked
in the Division II Top 20. That makes
the fifth team that W&L has played
that has been ranked. The other four
were Johns Hopkins, Messiah, North
Carolina Wesleyan and Mary Wash-
ington.

In the Mary Washington game last
Wednesday, the Generals were, ac-
cording to head coach Rolf Piranian,
“beaten by a real good team. Accord-
ing to them, it was the best game that
they had played.”’

The final score was 4-0, the fourth
time the Generals had been shut out
this year. No matter how Mary Wash-
ington played, Piranian was not at all
pleased with the Generals’ perfor-
mance. *‘I wasn’t high on our perfor-
mance. I didn’t see that we played
well at all. We're not getting the kind
of effort I'm expecting. We just didn’t

put together 90 minutes of effort.”’

The loss dropped the Generals to
5-5-1, but the team got back over the
.500 mark with a 3-0 win over Wash-
ington College on Friday afternoon.

Seniors accounted for all the scor-
ing. Johnny Sarber scored two goals
and had an assist. Co-captain Mike
Veliuona scored and had an assist, and
Jamie Urso had an assist.

Yesterday, the Generals came away
with a 1-1 tie against Randolph-
Macon on the Liberty Hall Fields.
Freshman David Hooker scored 18
minutes into the game to give the
Generals a 1-0 lead that lasted until
there were 13 minutes left in regula-
tion play.

With three games left in the season,
Piranian said the team is positive of
the position they are in. ‘*We are posi-
tive of where we are.’ he said. ‘‘We
would like to have a settled lineup and
substitution scheme, but I can’t say
we're there yet. We're still moving
forward, playing some stretches
where I like what I’m seeing.”

The Generals’ next home game is
Tuesday at 3:00 p.m. against Lynch-
burg.

has been all year. It was typical.’’

It still looked like the Generals
could pull it off, but then came The
Call. With just under six minutes re-
maining, one of the two officials ruled
a General had committed a flagrant
foul in the 18-yard box, thus awarding
Sweet Briar a penalty shot.

“It’s just a subjective call and he
called it the way he saw it,’’ Hathorn
said. ‘‘It’s the kind of call that’s going
to lose a game for a team. That’s the
kind of call that an official should just
stay off his whistle, unless he really
thinks it was a blatant, terrible thing.
It wasn’t, but that’s the way he
thought it had to be called and he did
what he had to do.”’

Laura Mangus took the free direct
kick and knocked in the game-winner
past Brown.

The Generals came into the game
with plenty of momentum, scoring an
incredible come-from-behind victory

sional actress like Martin raises the
quality of an entire production “Lu
cy’s presence and experience cause
everybody else to rise to her level.”
he says.

Ziegler chose Martin especially for
the part of Truvy. Through a mutual
New York friend, he was able to catch
her bewteen acting jobs to come to
Washington and Lee to serve as a
guest artist. Martin in Washington and
Lee’s first guest actor in recent years,
although each year the theater has had
a guest director of choreographer.

Joining Martin in the play are three
local actresses, Betty Kahn Taylor,
April Watts and Ginger McNeese, and
two W&L drama students, Zan Streib
and Monica Burke. ‘Although Truvy
is not a leading character, she is the
cement of the whole piece,"* says Zie
gler, who describes the play as an
‘‘ensemble piece. As the owner of the
beauty shop, she is the center of all ac-
tivity.””

‘Steel Magnolias’? currently is
playing off-Broadway in New York,
and after more than 500 performan-
ces, is still playing to sell-out audien-
ces. A move, which will be released
next year, is in the making with Dolly
Parton playing the role of Truvy.

Martin sees W&L’s production as
‘‘a very nice group effort.’’ She says

of the cast members, ‘‘Everybody is
commenting on everybody else. It’s a
wonderful learning experience for the
students."

A month spent in the Shenandoah
Valley is a welcome change for Mar
in. ‘I love being a guest artist,”” she
says. ‘‘When you come into a univer-
sity situation, the ground rules are a
little different. You put aside certain
rules. It's much more relaxed, more
laid back, especially at the undergra-
duate level.’ In addition to starring in
the play, Martin has been lecturing
and critiquing students in W&L’s act-
ing and directing classes.

Martin has served frequently as a
guest artist, but only one other time in
a university setting. There, she
worked with graduate students instead
of undergraduates. ‘‘It was more of a
conservatory situation with much
more competition among the students.
Instead of a learning experience, it
was more of a weeding out process,”
she remembers. ‘‘This is much more
fun.”

Martin says she sees ‘‘good things
happening’ in the drama department
at Washington and Lee. ‘So many
theaters are run on a_ shoestring.
W&L’s theater is better equipped than
some I’ve worked in New York (ex-

cluding Broadway). The technical as-

toire. The BBC will be singing in Lee Chapel Tuesday night at 8 p.m.

pect is terrific.”

The theater has played a major role
in Martin’s life. Growing up in New
York with parents who both worked in
thf theater probably influenced her
decision to pursue a career in acting,
she says. When she graduated from
Sweet Briar College, she was one of
three drama majors. All three still are
acting.

Martin colleges and uni-
versities as serving a major role in the
future of the arts in America. ‘‘They
are education the future philanthro-
pists of the country,’’ she says. **Un-
iversities, like Washington and Lee,
must be willing to support the arts and
must bring the arts to everybody's at-
tention. By not doing this, colleges are
not serving the world properly.”

Martin continued, *‘We are encoun-
tering a generation of consumers who
spend money on other forms of enter-
tainment, but do not buy artwork, or
go to the theater, or visit the museum.
This is a trend that is threatening the
survival of the arts.””
