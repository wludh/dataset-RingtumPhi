From Staff Reports

Construction on W&L’s new
home for the performing arts, the
Lenfest Center, is continuing on
schedule, with the completion date
set for September 1990.
Construction of the $9.8 million
project begafi last summer after
the university received a major
gift of $3 million from Marguerite
and H.F. (Gerry) Lenfest of
Huntingdon Valley, Pa. Lenfest is
a 1954 W&L graduate.

As work at the site progresses,
the university is offering area
residents and fine arts patrons the
opportunity to join in the
celebration of its commitment to
the arts by ‘‘naming a seat’’ in
the main theatre of the new
center. The main theatre will seat
425.

In addition to the $9.89 million
construction expenses, the W&L
Board of Trustees is seeking to
create a $2 million endowment to

Ronn William Mercer, the

probation.

million of the $11.8 million goal
has been met thus far. As
university officials near the
completion of their campaign, they
are asking alumni and friends of
W&L, as well as local patrons of
the arts, to help bridge the final
gap.

With a gift of $2,500, a donor

the performing arts continues as scheduled. The center’s
projected opening time is September 1990.

‘New performing arts center builds on

dance troupes, and traveling
theatre companies of national rank.
The new center will provide the
university, and the entire
Lexington and Rockbridge County
community, with an outstanding
facility that will enrich the cultural
life of the whole area.

Albert C. Gordon, head of the
W&L fine arts department, says
the Lenfest Center will a great
asset to the community. “The
building is going to be available
for community use, especially by
FAIR (Fine Arts in Rockbridge),
The Rockbridge Concert-Theatre
Series, and other local groups,”’
says Gordon.

““A number of local residents
have expressed their desire to
contribute to the Lenfest Center.
*Naming a seat’ in the theatre
provides the opportunity for local
people to contribute to the
building and be recognized for
their support,’’ Gordon said. He
also added that a number of
parents of current W&L students

have “‘named a seat’’ for their
children.

A committee is planning a gala
weekend celebration in January
1991, after the center opens the
preceding fall. Included in the
plans are a dinner recognizing all
donors and a series of events
featuring W&L groups and guest
artists,

Frank Parsons, director of
capital projects at the university,
says construction of the Lenfest
Center is going well. ‘‘We are
now in the process of bringing
utility lines toward the site, down
Washington Street between the
Warner Center and Gaines Hall,’’
Parsons said.

“This summer,’’ he added,
“the lines will have to cross
Route 60 (Nelson Street). We are

doing everything we can to
prepare for the phase of
construction, creating as little

inconvenience as we can in the
shortest amount of time as
possible.”’

Results from Washington
and Lee University’s winter
term reveal that women have
again attained a higher overall
grade point average (GPA)
than men.

As spring term begain this
week, the line at the registrar’s
office grew as students waited
to receive last semester’s
grades. A sheet tabulating re-
sults for all students and social
organizations, posted by Uni-
versity Registrar Scott Dittman,
showed females earned higher
marks.

This is the first grading pe-
riod that ranks the new sorori-
ties that were established this
past winter. Leading the pack
was Kappa Kappa Gamma
with a 3.08 cumulative GPA.
Both Chi Omega and Kappa
Alpha Theta recorded GPAs
above. = 29: Independent
women carried a 3.05 GPA.

Asked if this proved W&L
women to be smarter, Junior
Steven Gomez said, "I don’t

academically last term

think it proves that women are
smarter, I just think in general
that the girls here expend more
effort than the men."

Whether this is true remains
to be seen, but the men’s sta-
tistics certainly do not show
the consistency of the females’.
There is a .331 point spread in
the men’s grades as compared
to a .018 point spread in the
women’s grades,

For the men, Lambda Chi
Alpha led the way for the sec-
ond consecutive semester with
a 2.992 cumulative GPA, while
Sigma Phi Epsilon followed up
the rcar with a 2.581. No
men’s organization, including
independent men, tallied a
GPA over the 3.0 mark.

Junior Scott Pierce thinks
the grades this past term reflect
this quality of the females en-
tering the university since co-
education began in 1986, "It
is well-known that the stand-
ards for females and the stan-
dards for males are quite dif-
ferent," he said. "Whether

they [the women] are smarter
or not | don’t know. They
just seem more diligent."

LEXINGTON, VIRGINIA

APRIL 20, 1989

Search continues

 

By Elizabeth Parkins
Tri-Editor

Lexington police are _ still
searching for the hit-and-run driver
who killed W&L freshman Mary
Ashley Scarborough last month.

Police Chief Bruce Beard said
investigators have completed a
check on all blue cars registered
at nearby colleges. He said
Virginia Tech was the last to be
checked. He said they looked at
almost 100 blue cars. Beard said
investigators have not entirely
ruled out area schools and
continue to follow up on leads.

He said the investigators are
now using a printout of all
Hondas registered in a five county
area supplied by the Virginia
Division of Motor Vehicles.
Rockbridge, Augusta, Botetourt,
Rockingham and _ Roanoke
Counties are included, Beard said.

The Virginia State Police
investigator, called in to help the
Lexington Police investigation, has
finished a report that reconstructed
the hit and run. Beard said the
investigators are 100 percent
positive Scarborough was crossing
Washington Street toward Kappa

Alpha fraternity.

The police investigator
concluded that a car had been
traveling west on Washington
Street when it struck Scarborough
from the rear. The car then
swerved into the east-bound lane
and up a small hill. Police were
unable to get tire marks from the
grassy hill, Beard said.

In another development, Beard
said investigators found the blue
’87 Accord had been assembled in
a Merrysville, Ohio, plant.
According to Don Cobble, the
sales manager at the Honda
dealership in Staunton, American
Honda Corporation has only one

assembly plant in the United
States. Cobble said American
Honda’ keeps computerized

information of all shipments of its
cars throughout the U.S. He
added that they also keep records
of car sales for warranty purposes.
Cobble could not estimate how
many °87 Hondas were sold in the
U.S., but said that his dealership
dealt with roughly 200 cars.

Beard asks that anyone with
any type of information should
contact the police department at
463-2112.

Four fraternities named for the
renaissance renovation program

 

By Heidi Read
Tri-Editor

Four fraternities have been ac-
cepted into the Fraternity Renais-
sance renovation program, accord-
ing to Dean of Students Leroy C.
“Buddy”’ Atkins.

Atkins said the Fraternity Ren-
ovation Steering Committee, made
up of students and alumni, acce-
pted applications from Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon, Pi Kappa Alpha, Be-
ta Theta Pi and Sigma Nu. He
said the estimated cost of renova-
tion to those houses would be
$700,000 for SAE, $673,000 for
Pika, $759,000 for Beta and
$409,000 for Sigma Nu. The cost
of a new house would be about
$1 million.

Atkins said no other fraternities
except Phi Kappa Sigma had sub-
mitted applications to be consid-
ered for the renovation program.
He said their application had not
yet been considered by the com-
mittee.

Atkins said all the fraternity
renovation projects are ‘‘pretty
major and won’t be easy jobs.
{For example,}] SAE has some
structural problems.’’ None of the
fraternity houses have undergone

any major changes since they
were built in the 1920’s and 30’s.

Atkins said the renovation pro-
jects will not begin until about
March or April of next year and it
is not known how many houses
will be renovated at one time.

The restorations are part of a
$10 million program to renovate
W&L’s 17 fraternity houses.

The goal of the program is to
set uniform standards in all the
local chapters and strengthen the
fraternity system overall. The stan-
dards are mandatory and not op-
tional guidelines. All fraternities
must comply with the standards to
be eligible to participate in the
Fraternity Renaissance Program.

Under the program approved
by the board of trustees last Octo-
ber, the university will advance
financing for the renovation of the
17 fraternity houses, absorb cur-
rent mortgage balances and man-
age the renovations in return for
the title of the fraternity house.

Fraternities are not required to
participate in the renaissance fi-
nancing program, but they must
still comply with the university’s
“Standards for  Fraternities,”’
which also call for some physical
renovation of the fraternity houses.

OPINION
New blood

Critics of this year’s Phi, rejoice! The Publications
Board, the body that oversees W&L’s student publications,
has named the paper’s editors for 1989-90. Our
congratulations to rising seniors Stacy Morrison and Greg
Euston.

Is anybody out
there listening?

In recent weeks, The Phi has published MY VIEWS that
we considered somewhat controversial, to say the least.
Among other things, student writers have argued that
fraternities have the right racially to discriminate; that’
Louisiana legislator David Duke’s opponents aren’t as pure
as they’d have us believe; and that Salman Rushdie should
be condemned (though not to death). We thought such
essays would bring forth a flurry of rebuttals, yet our
mailbox remained pretty empty. If not for Tim
McMahon’s column on this page, we'd think W&L
students agreed with all the opinions we’ve published

While the afore-mentioned pieces were certainly well-
written and well-argued, we also thought they begged for a
response from someone, somewhere. If anyone out there
agrees, let us know. Your responses, comments and
criticisms, as letters or MY VIEWS, should be submitted
by noon on Tuesday to The Ring-tum Phi’s office in the
University Center or can be mailed to us at the address
given below. We’re looking forward to hearing from you.

The AP responds

To the Editors:

 

I have seen your March 23 editorial accusing our Richmond
bureau chief, Dennis Montgomery, of monkey business in his
coverage of the recent appearance of Donna Rice on your campus.

Your position seems to have been derived entirely from a letter
written by your respected Dr. Louis Hodges. There is another
view.

When the proceedings were placed off the record, Montgomery
left the room, an exercise in ethical behavior that was sure to avoid
the temptation to stay and then writhe with frustration on hearing
something that could not be shared with readers.

Then a distinguished member of your faculty saw Montgomery
outside and told him the proceedings were on the record.
Montgomery went back in. And he proceeded to commit some ”
journalism.

Whatever the problem here, it has nothing to do with a lapse of
Montgomery’s ethics. It had everything to do with a seminar that
couldn’t make up its mind about what it wanted to be.

While you're fretting about journalistic ethics, you might think
just a bit about launching an attack on someone’s ethics after
having heard only one side. :

I write without rancor toward your campus, which I’ve enjoyed
visiting, toward Dr. Hodges, whose work in journalism ethics has a
national reputation, or toward Miss Rice, with whom I have never
sailed or spoken.

Sincerely,

Louis D. Boccardi
President and General Manager

The IRA:

MY VIEW
By Tim McMahon ’87

 

 

"An opinion infected by ignorance is
harmless until acted on, when it can become a
source of embarrassment or worse, when
confronted with one more firmly based in
fact." -- Charles Gay, "My View," The Ring-
tum Phi, March 16, 1989.

These words precede an opinion piece
denouncing an individual’s financial support of
the militant Irish Republican Army. That the
IRA participates in brutal killings (sometimes
resulting in the accidental deaths of
bystanders) is undeniable; however, since its
inception, any Irish nationalist violence has
been condemned by the Catholic Church in
Ireland, and even the Republic of Ireland
considers the IRA an outlaw organization.
Nonetheless, what is most disturbing about the
author’s denunciation is the equally undeniable
lack of factual basis for his statement that the
Protestants of Norther Ireland “are as Irish as
anyone else, having lived there for 350 years."
To work from this assumption is to deny 2000
years of Irish history.

First, one must attempt to define "Irish."
The chief misconception about Ireland is that
it is simply an extension of Great Britain.
Since the Celtic tribe known as the Gaels
arrived on the isle of Erin (circa 500 BC),
any foreign influence has been assimilated into
the native culture. In fact, until the nineteenth
century when famine caused mass
emigration and state schools made English a
required subject Gaelic language and
customs were elements of the longest
surviving, continually developing culture in
Western Europe.

Catholicism, whose Irish roots trace back
to the legendary St. Patrick, did not rule
Ireland in the same way the religion of a
traditional European monarchy determined the
religion of that monarchy’s subjects. Instead,
Catholicism became as much a part of the
daily existence of every Irish person as the
Gaelic language. With hindsight, the greatest
irony of today’s religious strife is the original
English claim to power over Ireland -- the
Laudbiliter of 1155, a paper bull (decree)
granting the English King Henry II lordship of

Irish loyalty to Rome.

Still, it wasn’t until the Reformation rocked
England that there was significant Irish
resistance to England. Irish leaders opposed
Tudor excesses and later those of the Long
Parliament. As a_ result, the | English
systematically attempted to destroy the Irish
will. Mercantilist laws forever linked the Irish
economy to the British market, and,
remembering virtually 100 percent of the
native Irish were Catholics, the British Penal
laws "outlawed" Catholicism.

The most successful tactic used to supplant
the Irish people, however, was plantation --
uprooting the local leaders and population and
"planting" loyal British subjects (who

happened to be devout Protestants). Plantation
reached its apex in Ulster where a particularly
large number of Scotch Presbyterians moved
to avoid’ English Anglican persecution. Only
in the nineteenth century, after England saw
fit to include Presbyterians in the power
structure of the North did the "Orange
Card" -- using religious difference to
encourage the status quo suppression of
Catholics -- become an effective element of
Ulster’s political union with Britain.

Since plantation, the Protestants of the
North have resisted assimilating most native
customs into their daily routine. § They
consider themselves British. Ulster Catholics,
meanwhile, feel closer to the Catholics of the
South rather than to their Protestant neighbors;
they see themselves as Irish. It is this
identity crisis of British versus Irish, and only
secondarily Protestant versus Catholic, which
is the chief cause of turmoil in the region.

In a militant fashion, the IRA attempts to
expel what it sees as an alien element from
home soil. At the same time, however,
Protestant organizations, such as the Royal
Ulster Constabulary and the Ulster Volunteer
Force, utilize equally violent measures against
Ulster Catholics. One seldom hears of RUC

legitimate organizations in the eyes of the
Unionist power structure. :

What the IRA represents today is actually
a distillation of more than 800 years of
resentment toward a foreign oppression. For
the last 200 of those years, differcmt
individuals and organizations have arisen to
push first for the reinstitution of home rule of
domestic affairs and later for a completely
free Ireland. Some chose to use constitutional
means. Others have turned to violence.

As the author of the previous piece pointed
out, "the partition was not an arbitrary event,"
He further states as if to show the
benevolence of the partitioners -- "the Briti$h
government did see fit to allow three of the
area’s sister counties...to join the new free
Ireiand in 1921." What he neglects to say is
that during separate negotiations, Britaim’s
Lloyd George told the Irish Nationalists the
partition would be temporary, while he told
the Irish Unionists the partitions would be
permanent. Once separate deals were struck,
he opted for the permanent course. The
unionists also wanted those three sister
counties separated from the rest of Ulster
because their Catholic populations would have
disturbed the Unionist majority in. Northern
Ireland’s new Parliament. a 4

Currently, an understanding exists that so
long as a majority of the population in
Northern Ireland wants union with Britain,
union will exist. But the Catholic minority jn
Northern Ireland makes up 40 percent of the
population, and the Catholic _ birthrdic
outdistances the Protestant enough that by the
year 2025, Catholics could outnumber
Protestants. Still, Britain resists talk of” a
united Ireland, primarily on the grounds tat
they do not want to abandon the Unionists.

What all this means is this: simply
condemning the IRA is ludicrous. One can
disagree with their methods, as I do, but one
can also understand their motive. One final
irony is that in a country such as ours, We
can understand the African National Congress’
desire for changes in South Africa, yet we
overlook 800 years’ worth of _ simifar
oppression on a small island in the Atlantic.
You may be right, Mr. Gay. It is wrong to
Support atrocities, but if this is so, how can
you overlook the reality of a divided Ireland?

MY VIEW

By Jon Sbar

Every country in the world has
a national hobby. In France, for
example, the local inhabitants
spend their leisure time sitting
around cafes eating croissants (or
jelly doughnuts) and discussing
politics, philosophy and the Eiffel
Tower. The English keep busy
with tea breaks and the royal
family. And Americans, who are
more dignified than Europeans,
drink beer with their friends and
wait until the conversation turns to
the subject of sports.

Once on the subject of sports,
friends will argue against each
other for hours (sometimes weeks)
until one party concedes defeat
(usually after a fist fight). Not on-
ly are hypothetical sporting
debates good for mental health,
they also. insure American
prosperity,

As long as Bob and Ken (two
high school students) can spend
seven consecutive hours debating
the outcome of an imaginary box-
ing match between Muhammed
Ali in his prime and reigning
heavyweight champion Mike Ty-
son, America will remain a world
power. The fact that Shomoto
(Bob and Ken’s Japanese counter-
part) is learning vector calculus
while Bob and Ken do their long
division homework, humming mu-
sic television tunes means nothing.

As a patriotic American I felt
good about spending a recent

 

Sunday arguing sports and drink-
ing Budweiser with Dexter, my
best friend’s uncle’s once removed
cousin’s aborted fetus. On the sub-
ject of the world’s most difficult
sport, Dexter argued for triathlons
while I opted for airline travel.
What started out as a_ friendly
conversation soon turned into an
embroiling controversy. Since
Dexter is a leading astrophysicist,
I knew he would be impervious to
emotional expressions (especially
those involving violence). If I
tried to convince him by breaking

parent confidence, no one board-
ing an airplane really thinks the
plane will take-off and land safely.
This fact is true regardless of the
successful flights the traveler has
completed. In addition, the prob-
lem is compounded by newspaper
headlines like, ‘‘Commercial air-
plane engine falls out in midair:
screaming passengers disintegrate
during explosion.’’ Anyone with
the courage to board an airplane
has the potential to wrestle alliga-
tors, work for the CIA, or finish
reading this article.

 

Airline travel, invented sometime in the
19th century by the Wright brothers,
requires courage, dexterity, intelligence,
strength, patience and an airplane. There-
fore, anyone who participates in this elite
sport can be considered a great athlete.

 

his nose he would simply reply,
“‘But your point is moot.”’

To defeat Dexter I needed hard
facts based on the scientific meth-
od. Here’s what I came up with:

Title: Why Airline Travel Is
The Greatest Sport Known To
Man

Preamble: Airline travel,
invented sometime in the 19th
century by the Wright brothers,
requires courage, dexterity, intel-
ligence, strength, patience and an
airplane. Therefore, anyone who
participates in this elite sport can
be considered a great athlete.

Data:

1. Courage: Regardless of ap-

2. Dexterity: The need for
passenger dexterity begins even
before boarding the plane. In order
for passengers (who by definition
are always late) to reach their
planes on ume they must run
through crowded airport corridors
avoiding abandoned luggage, jani-
tors, wheelchairs, motorized trans-
portation vehicles and Hari Krish-
na’s trying to give books away.
Once on the plane, passengers
wanting to visit the lavatory (air-
line lingo for bathroom) in order
to see the blue toilet water need
acrobatic skills to get by steward-
esses and their double decker food
and beverage carts.

with hopes of getting to his or her
destination had better have a good
strategy for the baggage belt. The
ability to jockey for position
around hostile passengers waiting
for lost luggage is no small feat,
4. Strength: Toting wieldy
suitcases through parking lots ahd
airports is great workout. In fact,
many great body builders started
out as world travelers. :
5. Patience: When a landed air-
plane finally comes to a complete

MERCER

ceived that report around Feb. 22,
1989.)

Here is a summary of the
events that led to Mercer’s convic-
tion, based on the Sept. 6 indict-
ment and police reports:

Mercer stole 25 pieces of Chi-
nese export porcelain and eight
small carved ivory figurines from
the center on or about Aug. 4,
1988, the grand jury said. Mercer
worked there as an undergraduate
and during the summer after he
graduated, according to John
Elrod, who was serving as W&L’s
acting president when Mercer first
appeared in court.

Mercer then contacted Flying
Crane Antiques of New York
City, apparently in hopes of sell-
ing the items, according to
Lexington Police Lt. Stephen E.
Crowder.

“The guy at Flying Crane
Antiques said, ‘‘Let me get a hold
of a friend of mine to appraise
this,” according to Crowder. That
dealer then contacted another New
York City antiques dealer, who
recognized the items Mercer was
offering as part of the Reeves
Center’s collections, Crowder said.

That dealer then contacted
Reeves Center Director James
Whitehead, who confronted Mer-
cer, and Mercer then confessed,
said Crowder.

Kirkland told The Phi White-
head is in France this week, and
attempts .by The Phi to contact
him there were unsuccessful.
Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric
Lee Sisler could not be reached
for comment.

On Aug. 17, 1988, Mercer
wrote a_ three-page, handwritten
letter to Whitehead, Reeves Center
staff member James Kirkland and
university President John Wilson.
In that letter, a copy of which was
obtained by The Phi from the
Rockbridge County clerk of
court’s office, Mercer apologized
for what he called ‘“‘the shame I
have brought to Washington and
Lee.’’ He said he had never stolen
before in his life and still doesn’t
understand why he allowed him-
self ‘‘to take part in such an ac-
tion.”

“TI allowed myself to get
caught up in my own problems
and unfortunately fell prey to the
trap of an easy solution,’’ wrote
Mercer. ‘‘Now, however, rather
than solve my original problem |
have created for myself even more
serious problems.”’

Mercer said, ‘‘it was truly my
intention to replace the objects
involved once I was able and
hopefully be able to contribute to
the collection’s growth.”’

But Mercer said he is now
‘mortified by the consequences’’
of his actions and ‘‘will do every-
thing in my power to set things
right.”’

Mercer concluded by saying,
“I am scared, yet all I can do
now is sit back and meditate on
my stupidity and weakness in the
solving of a problem. | am
quickly learning a day of stupidity
can negate years of hard work and
remain with one for a lifetime.”’

atfect my life. They were fighting
for equality and the opportunity to
make their way successfully in
life.

The ’80s have rolled around
and protesting has not gone out of
style. Only now, =I _ fully
understand the implications of
what is being protested. Like the
demonstrations of the ’60s and
70s, women today feel just as
strongly about their rights. They
have taken to the streets and
voiced their concerns; they are
standing up and being counted.

W&L has taught me_ that
education is everything. But
Politics 102 and Sociology 270
never taught me that in the real
world I would have to go beyond
reading and writing about personal
ideals. I understand now that they
are but a_ starting point from
which to make myself heard.

I realize that it is often
difficult to stand up for something
as volatile as pro-choice or pro-
life. The controversy has pitted
mother against daughter; neighbor
against neighbor; friend against
friend. But the lessons of the ’60s
and ’70s have kept nagging at me
and | realize that if others could
speak out so must I.

I had just that opportunity
when I joined the pro-choice
demonstration in Washington D.C.

completely in a cause (I don’t

life--young, radical women with
short, cropped hair dyed black;
married women wearing Reeboks
and pulling baby carriages; and
older women who could remember
the days when there was no
choice. They all felt the same way
though, and it struck me that one
single cause could bring so many
people together at once.

I was apprehensive at first
about going. Would it be
dangerous? What if people I knew
saw me there? Would this be just
a left-over remnant of some far-
gone radical movement? Happily,
I discovered that it was an
exercise of what makes this

The First Amendment of the
Bill of Rights guarantees every
citizen of this country a right to
peaceably assemble and a right to
a redress of grievances. The
March on Washington was a
testimonial to the veracity of these
rights. To be able to gather
together and make a statement is a
liberty to revel in.

Justice Cardoza of the Supreme

knew what it meant to deny
rights, so they chose not to. They
recognized that the Bill of Rights
was meant not only to protect the
rights of the majority, but the

minority as well. Without the Bill
of Rights, we would not be able
to stand up and be counted.

I’m not ashamed to voice my
opinion, march in protest, or write
about my experiences. Speaking
out for pro-choice was a decision
made not just for me, but for
those who do not yet have the
courage to protest. The American
public is the greatest check on out
liberal, democratic regime yet
devised. I only wish more people
would recognize this.

I’ve found that most often it is

New IFC-police

program

By Clint. Wheelock
Staff Reporter

 

 

For the past month, — the
Interfraternity Council has been
working closely with the

Lexington Police Department in a
program designed to further
fraternity-police understanding on
a house-by-house basis.

Nearly half of W&L’s
fraternity houses have met so far
with Lieutenant Steven Crowder in
an effort to clarify a number of
problematic issues. The hour-long
sessions, held in various chapter
houses, focus primarily on such
controversial subjects as students’
right as residents of Lexington and
officers’ justification of probable
cause as well as specific charges,
including Drunk in Public and
Driving Under Intoxication. In
addition, reports Frank Kannapell,
the IFC’s Public Relations officer,

opportunity to instruct fraternity
members on how such. incidences
can be properly and _ lawfully
avoided, thus benefiting both the
local police and W&L’s student

body.

One of the most informative
aspects, according to fraternity
members who have attended the
sessions, is the question and

that they learn a great deal and
gain a much clearer insight on
how the police look at things.

"The IFC is very grateful for
the cooperation it has received
from the Lexington Police
Department,” says Kannapell. The
police involvement program has
clearly made great strides in
improving the somewhat
precarious relationship that has
existed between  W&L's
fraternities and the LPD for quite
a while.

Wé&L grad starting

The Ring-tum Phi, April 20, 1989

a winery in county

 

By Greg Euston
Staff Reporter

 

Shepard Rouse, who graduated
from W&L in 1976, is starting a
winery just up the road from his
alma mater.

Rouse recently appealed to the
Rockbridge County Planning Com-
mission to have his land rezoned
from residential to agricultural-
general. Rouse currently leases
the land to an Augusta dairyman
and now wants to use it to make
Rockbridge County wine.

His company, Rockbridge
Vineyard and Winery Co., should
begin releasing its first wine next
fall. Rouse said he wants to start
turning his dairy barn into a win-
ery as soon as he gets approval
from the county. A winery and a
dairy barn are very similar, said
Rouse, and it will take about ten
months to build the winery.

As soon as he gets the go-
ahead, Rouse said he is going to
Start planting his grapes. Grapes
are grown from stock, not seeds,
said Rouse. It takes about three
years for grapes to grow, and they
need about five years to teach
their full potential.

Until then, Rouse will have to
buy grapes from other growers in
the area. Lovingston is the clos-
est vineyard, said Rouse, and there
are other nearby vineyards in the

Shenandoah valley.

"Rockbridge County isn’t ex-
actly the Napa Valley,” said
Rouse, who said he is going to
depend on his skill and experience
as a wine maker to make his
wine. While in Germany on his
scholarship, Rouse began making
wine and continued for 12 years.
He then attended the University of
California at Davis and added a
graduate degree in wine making to
his W&L background in environ-
mental science.

Rouse plans to sell his wine on
site in the beginning, then state-
wide in the long term. "In Ger-
many, wine is food," said Rouse.
I hope by selling a $5.50 bottle of
wine, I can make people realize
that wine is not just for the rich
and famous, he said. "The key is
to make a product that most any-
one can enjoy and afford."

Rouse said he returned to
Rockbridge County because he
likes the area. The site he has
chosen is next to I-64 and 1-81,
and he said he likes it because he
wants to sell his wine on-site. In
the first phase of production, said
Rouse, he plans to use about 15
acres of his land for vineyard and
winery with eventual expansion to
about 100 acres.

Currently, Rouse plans to make
both red and white wines.
Because of consumer preference,

Rouse said, he is going to make
mostly inexpensive white wine and
some upscale red wine.

"There are some closely guard-
ed secrets in wine making," he
said. Time has shown that some
of the French methods of wine
making are the best, but innova-
tion also makes good wines, he
said. Today, he added, there is a
great deal of practical, affordable
technology available to help cut
comers.

Rouse said he can make a bot-
tle of white wine in about three
months, grape to bottle, including
a month for the wine to get over
"bottle shock". When wine is bot-
tled, it has to be filtered and
poured, and the wine needs to sit
in the bottle to recover from the
handling, said Rouse.

Initially, Rouse plans to
produce 5,000 cases of wine a
year. He plans on about $350,000
a year in gross annual sales. In
his appeal to the planning com-
mission, Rouse said what he is
doing will economically _ benefit
the county. First, he said he is
helping promote the cottage indus-
try in Rockbridge. These small
businesses are alternatives to fac-
tories and tourist traps.

Also, he said, a business like
this helps tourism in Rockbridge
without turning the county into a
"crass tourism area,"

Baseball wins
fifth straight

 

 

By Jay Plotkin
Assistant Sports Editor

The Washington and Lee base-
ball team has come up with a
knack for late game heroics.

In the midst of a five-game
winning streak, their longest since
1972, the Generals have won two
games in their last at bat. 1972
was also the last time that W&L
finished with a winning record,
and at 9-6 with just two games
left to play, the Generals are as-
sured of another winning season.

After dropping a doubleheader
to Shenandoah by one run in each
game, the Generals responded with
five straight Old Dominion Athlet-
ic Conference wins.

The first two wins came in the
form of a doubleheader sweep of
Emory and Henry. In the first
game, the Generals scored three
times in the sixth and seventh in-
nings to win 3-0. Freshman Steve
Momorella pitched the shutout for
the Generals.

The nightcap was a slugfest,
with the Generals scoring 10 times
in the last two innings to win 20-
11. Senior Rich Grace got the
win in relief for W&L.

The streak continued at Lynch-
burg. The Generals scored five
unearned runs in the top of the
ninth to earn their first regular se-
ason win over Lynchburg since
1984. Senior catcher Eddie Klank
started the comeback with a two-
run triple to make the score 3-2
Hornets. Grace, the designated
hitter, reached on a error, scoring
Klank with the tying run. Senior
Tony Waskiewicz completed the
comeback with a two-run home

run for the win. Senior Mike
Temple went the distance for his
second victory.

At home against Hampden-Syd-
ney, the Generals upset the second
place conference team, and once
again it came in their last at bat.
Klank was the hero for W&L, hit-
ling a towering home run to cen-
ter field, his third of the year, af-
ter Tom Skeen singled to start the
bottom of the ninth. Klank, who
was 4-for-4 on the day, got his
fourth game-winning RBI to make
a winner of Grace, who moved to
2-0 after relieving Temple in the
seventh.

Momorella took the mound in
Wednesday’s contest at Eastern
Mennonite. The freshman pitched
a complete game for an 8-6 win
to move his record to a perfect 4-
0. He scattered 13 hits en route
to his third complete game of the
season. The Generals iced the
game with two runs in the top of
the ninth to take an 8-4 lead.
Tim Wheeler drove in both runs
with a two-out single, scoring Kla-
nk, who was 3-for-5, and Skeen,
who was 4-for-4.

Wheeler’s single proved crucial,
as Momorella ran into trouble in
the bottom of the ninthh EMC
loaded the bases and scored twice
on infield grounders, but Momore-
lla got Marty Meadows to pop out
to end the game.

The Generals can assure them-
selves of hosting a first round
ODAC tournament game by win-
ning one of their last two games,
either against Randolph-Macon or
Hampden-Sydney. It would be
the first time that W&L has ever
played an ODAC first round game
at home.

The W&L linksters have once again gotten off to
a slow start only to hit stride in the past two weeks.
The Generals smoked Shenandoah’s course Wednes-
day en route to a team total 301, miles ahead of
Shenandoah’s 359. Freshman Clay Thomas carded a
71 to go along with sophomore Brian Kopet’s 73,
senior Tom Wingfield’s 78 and freshman Jay
McKnight’s 79.

“‘We burned it [Wednesday],’’ said head coach

This hot streak, Which seems so similar to last
spring’s late title run that gave the Generals the
ODACs and W&L its first ever team bid to the
NCAA championships, began last Friday at home in
a six-team ODAC Round Robin Tournament. The
Generals posted a score of 308, edging Roanoke by
two shots. Lynchburg was third at 316, followed by
Hampden-Sydney (317), Randolph-Macon (320) and
Bridgewater (324).

W&L was led by junior Ted Fox in this one,
who shot a 76 on the par-71 course. Senior co-
captain Pete Coleman and Wingfield each turned in
77s, while Kopet scored a 78.

The Generals continued to post low scores on
Tuesday, this time in tough conditions at an ODAC
Round Robin at Roanoke College. Despite a fierce
wind, W&L had three players break 80, winning the
mini-ODAC with a team score of 315. McKnight
(77), Thomas (77), Coleman (78) and Kopet (83) led

‘It’s a tough course anyway, but when the wind

it was remarkable that we had three in the 70s.””

The golfers will most likely need to play even
more rounds in the 70s if they hope to repeat as
ODAC champs. One advantage certainly comes
from playing on their home course, and if you are
worried about the greens, worry no more.

‘‘The course is in excellent shape - well mani-
cured. It is superb,’ said Leslie. ‘‘It should be in
great shape for the ODACs.

Leslie also sees the Generals in good shape head-
ing into the championship.

‘We've got ourselves in the hunt,’’ he said. ‘‘I
think anyone can win it. You want to keep in posi-
tion after the first day. No one wants to shoot

themselves out of it during the first round.

Wa&L lacrosse
11-3 home loss

 

By Jay Plotkin
Assistant Sports Editor

 

For the Washington and Lee men’s lacrosse &

team, things seem to be getting worse as the season
grows longer.

After defeating Middlebury College 9-8 on
Wilson Field immediately before exams, the
Generals were beaten soundly by nationally ranked
arch-rivals Hampden-Sydney and Roanoke.

Against Middlebury, the Generals ran off four
straight goals to take a 4-1 lead after the opening
quarter. Sophomore Mike Pardo got the Generals
on the board with 13:02 left in the period off an
assist from classmate Todd Garliss. On the ensuing
faceoff, senior Stu Geisel won the draw and streaked
toward the goal. He found a wide open John Ware,
a senior co-captain in front of the goal to give
W&L a 2-1 lead just five seconds after Pardo’s
goal. Ware then fed sophomore Mike Moseman for
a goal and scored another goal himself to close the
first quarter scoring.

In the second quarter, sophomore Brian Overbeck
scored off an assist from Moseman to give the
Generals a 5-3 lead at the half.

In the third stanza, Ware found freshman Drew
Anton to extend the lead back to three goals, but
Ron Willett scored two of his four goals to bring
Middlebury within one at 6-5. Ware added his third
goal of the day to give the Generals a 7-5 edge
after three quarters.

The Panthers twice closed to one goal in the
final quarter after Overbeck scored his second goal
of the game for the Generals. When Damon White
scored his first goal of the day, the score was 8-7.
Jim Jones, a junior, had the answer for W&L, and
his goal with 7:00 left. gave the Generals an
insurmountable 9-7 lead. White scored again for
Middlebury to close out the scoring.

After a break for exams, the Generals travelled
to Hampden-Sydney for an Old Dominion Athletic
Conference game with the Tigers. It was Hampden-
Sydney’s greek week, and the Tigers had a party at
the Generals’ expense.

On a rainy day with mud flying everywhere, the
Generals hung tough for a quarter. H-SC led 3-0
after one quarter, and Garliss scored off a Ware
assist to start the second quarter. But 3-1 would be
as close as the Generals would get.

The Tigers ran off the next 12 goals to take a
15-1 advantage. During the run, Bob Babcock
scored three of his five goals on the day and Brad
Johnson three of his four goals and had six of his
seven assists.

The Generals then returned home to take on
Roanoke College. Ware scored early on to make
the score 2-1 Maroons, and then a familiar scene
occurred. The Generals offense took the next two-
plus quarters off, never really pressuring Roanoke
goalie Steve Mason, who made 15 saves on the day.

During W&L’s offensive hiatus, the Maroons
took a 9-1 lead behind the scoring of Jerry
Caramelli and Graham Calloway, who each had
three goals on the day, and Will ‘‘Bobcat’’
Goldthwait, who tallied two goals and two assists.
Douoguih put a little life in the Generals fire with
two fourth quarter goals, but it was not enough as
Roanoke prevailed 11-3.

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee wom-
en’s lacrosse team won three
of five games over spring
break and this week. The
Generals started by defeating
Old Dominion Athletic Confer-
ence rival Randolph-Macon
Woman’s College 14-9.

On Thursday the Generals
faced Hollins College in what
both teams knew would be a
close game. W&L, however,
came out on the losing end of
the 5-4 score. The Generals
traveled Sweet Briar College
on Friday for another ODAC
match. The Generals lost the
game 10-9 but rallied from a
9-6 deficit to make the game
close. On Saturday, W&L re-
bounded with a 14-9 victory
over Randolph-Macon/Ashland.

The Generals traveled to
Guilford yesterday and raised
their record to 6-6 with a 10-5
win.

 

The weather wasn’t cooper-
ative for the Washington and
Lee men’s track and field team
for the second weekend in a
row. Rain dampened the
WAL effort at the Catholic In-
vitational in Washington, D.C,
on Saturday, and it dampened
W&L’s preparations for this
week’s ODAC Championships,
as well.

 

W&L will be seeking its
third Old Dominion Athletic
Conference outdoor track and
field championship in a row at
this Saturday’s meet, which
will be held at Bridgewater
College. But it will be W&L’s
toughest ODAC title defense
ever, according to head coach
Norris Aldridge.

Rain and injuries are the
reasons, Aldridge said.

“It will be our toughest be-
cause we have a lot of people
injured,’ he said. ‘“But our
kids know it, and they know
what they have to do. Injuries
are part of any sport, and we
can’t let that bother us.”’

W&L did have some good
performances at the Catholic

Invitational. | The 400-meter
relay team of junior Wes
Boyd, senior Scott Williams,

and sophomores Erik Adkins
and Carl Gilbert captured first
place. Sophomore — distance
man David Martin finished
fifth in the 1500 meters with a
time of 4:02.7.

Aldridge said the ODAC
should be a close call this
year.

=~» Tennis teams look for

sweep in conference

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Come Friday and Saturday, the
Washington and Lee tennis teams
will have an opportunity to make
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
history.

Never before has the same
school captured both the men’s
and women’s titles, but both W&L
squads have an excellent chance to
do so. The men’s championships
will be held in Ashland at
Randolph-Macon College, while
the women’s championships will
take place right here on W&L’s
Own courts.

The men’s team, (7-9, 2-0 in
the ODAC, 5-1 against Division
Ill competition) has dominated
ODAC play in recent years, win-
ning the title the last four seasons
running. Last year the Generals
swept all six singles and all three
doubles flights to take the champi-
onship with a perfect score of 72
points. And for W&L head coach
Gary Franke, this weekend hopes
to be a repeat performance.

The Generals are using a solid
performance during a rugged spr-
ing break in Florida as momentum
intlo the ODACs. W&L split its
four matches, beating NAIA Flag-
ler 6-3 and D-I Stetson 6-3,
before falling to NAIA power
North Florida 6-3 and No. 4-
ranked D-II Rollins 5-4 in a close
match. |The Generals currently
hold the No. 4 ranking in the
NCAA D-III polls.

W&L is led by junior John
Morris, who is ranked in the top
five in the nation. Senior co-cap-
tain Bobby Matthews, last year’s

ODAC Player-of-the-Year, has the
vest individual singles record on
the team (13-3). As a doubles
team, Morris and Matthews are
ranked third in D-III.

The road to the NCAAs does
not end after this weekend’s

championships, however. The
men still have two tough matches
versus Emory University, ranked
No.11 in D-III, on April 29, and
highly-ranked D-II power Hamp-
ton Institute on May 6.

For the W&L women, this
year’s ODACs are a chance to
avenge last season’s second-place
finish, a mere one-half point be-
hind champion Sweet Briar. The
women, like the men, had a good
spring break, using the latter part
of the week for practice time.
The Generals posted wins over
Millsaps 7-2 and held on for a 5-
4 victory over Rhodes, the No.4-
ranked team in the South, W&L
also grabbed some key ODAC
matches on Tuesday and Wednes-
day, downing Sweet Briar 5-4 and
Lynchburg 9-0, respectively.

We really played some good
tennis last week,’’ said W&L co-
coach David McLeod. ‘‘We only
had one bad match (a loss to
Sewanee on April 8). We got in
a lot of good practice time.’’

Sophomore Jean Stroman,
W&L’s No.l player and 1988
ODAC Pilayer-of-the-Year, will be
looking to defend her ODAC ttle
at No. 1 singles, as _ will
sophomore No. 2 player Kelly
Martone. Junior Teresa Southard,
who won the title at No. 4 singles
last year, will try to do the same
at No. 3 singles this year.

The Ring-tum Phi, April 20, 1989,

 

‘Little Shop of Horrors’ is a Killer Production

Professor Al Gordon will direct the hit show at the University Theatre May 12 - 20

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

In 1960, writer Charles Griffith and director
Roger Corman put together a black comedy about a
carnivorous plant that turned his geeky owner’s
* future from rags to riches overnight. The film billed
as “‘the film shot in two days’’ and much later as
Jack Nicholson's film debut was well-received but
the reception was nothing like the play and film that
came from it.

In 1982, Howard Ashman and Alan Menken took
the story from Griffith’s screenplay and tured it
into an Off-Off Broadway musical called ‘“‘Little
Shop of Horrors.’’ Now only seven years since it’s
original inception, ‘‘Littke Shop of Horrors’’ will be
performed on the Washington and Lee campus
Starting May 12 and running through May 20.

What exactly is ‘‘Litthke Shop?’’ The answer is- a
lot of different things. The story opens in Mushnik’s
Skid Row Florist Shop where Mr. Mushnik is
announcing to his two employees, Seymour and
Audrey, that due to poor business he is closing the
shop. In desperation Audrey suggest that Seymour
put his ‘‘new’’ plant in the window to attract

 

customers. Much to everyone’s surprise, when
Seymour puts the Audrey II (named in honor of his
secret crush on Audrey) in the store window
customers begin pouring in.

The fun begins that same night when Seymour
pricks his finger on a rose thorn. As he goes to
wipe the blood off his finger the Audrey II sits up
and begins trying to suck Seymour’s finger. As
Seymour moves his finger closer to the plant the
Audrey II snaps at his finger as if to bite it off. To
do what he thinks will save the otherwise sickly
little plant, Seymour squeezes a few drops of blood
into the plant’s mouth and begs it to grow.

Grow it does! The cannibalistic Audrey II

continues to grow until it grows larger than Seymour
himself with total transformation climaxing as the
Audrey II begins to speak and sing.
From here on out, ‘‘Littke Shop of Horrors’ takes
numerous wild turns including ones involving a
sadistic dentist addicted to nitrous-oxide who just
happens to be Audrey’s greasy bohunk boyfriend.

In his Author’s Note at the beginning of the
script, Ashman says, ‘‘LITTLE SHOP OF

Faust legend.’’ The score is filled with wondertul
50s/60s doo-wop music and the special effects that
accompany the show are unbelievable.

To put on the show, four different models of the
Audrey. II are needed from a small flower pot size
plant to one that takes up the entire stage. W&L
senior Drew Platt has been working on the designs
for the Audrey II for the entire year and is heading
up the team of technicians that will put the monster
mound of foliage together. Once together, W&L
freshman Willie Henderson will actually sit inside
the plant as a puppeteer to make it move and dance
to the music.

Perhaps the most imyortant performers in the
production are Ronnette, Crystal and Chiffon who
will be performed oy W&L senior Courtney
Harpold, W&L freshman Koran Washington and
W&L senior Margaret Pimblett respectively. The
doo-wop trio is in almost every scene of the
production and act as a kind of morbid cross
between the Fates and the Supremes.

W&L senior Michael Carroll will perform the part
of Seymour, Audrey II’s owner and friend. Audrey,
the bubble-headed blonde who Seymour secretly
loves but who loves the sadistic Orin Scrivello will

 

be played by W&L senior Monica Burke who was
just granted admission to the Columbia University
Graduate School of Drama. Rounding out the three
cast members from the florist shop is W&L junior
Todd Peppers who will play the part of Mushnik,
the old New York jew who runs the florist shop.
W&L junior Scott Bell will perform the part of Orin
Scrivelio the sadistic dentist who eventually becomes
quite close to both Audreys. As stated, freshman
Willie Henderson will perform the movements of the
plant, ‘Sut the voice will come from W&L senior
Michae: Tuggle.

Other students inciuding Ryan Kull, Lee Fleming,
Nancy Hickham, Andrew Keller, Kristen Ramberg
and W&L Law student Amy Dillard will also be
performing in the production.

Fine Arts Department Head Al Gordon will be
directing the show that will run the fifth weck of
the spring term. As usual, opening night will be on
the Friday night of Alumni Weekend which is May
12 this year with the Closing night performance
coming cight days later on May 20.

Reservations are being taken now for the nine
performances at the University Box Office. The
number is 462-8637.

The Cult looks backward on
its new album Sonic Temple

By Bryant Spann
Staff Reporter

My mind races as I drop the
virgin disk into place and watch
the door of my CD player slide
shut. Which Cult will we hear
this time? The post-modern psy-
cho-band that gave use the 1985
Love album, or the streamlined
razor-rockers who cranked out
Electric in 1987? The first mea-
sures of the lead-off track "Sun
King" seem to indicate a return to
Love as Billy Duffy’s whining six-
string floats over an abyss of slid-
ing bass riffs and cymbal pings.
The band then launches into a
Zen-rock stomp that recalls the
Love single "Nirvana". But when
the chest-kicking drum track takes
over before the first verse, I say
to myself, "They’re up to
something." And indeed they are.
Ian Asterbury wails like a heathen
god as the song alternates between
verses of brain-crushing guitar and
bass roars and _highly-layered,
driving choruses. On Sonic Tem-
ple, The Cult have managed to
unite the spirits of their last two
albums. And it works.

They have accomplished this
fusion with the help of producer
Bob Rock, who recently worked
with Bon Jovi on New Jersey (but
we won't hold that against him).
Rock has given the album an

edges guitarist Duffy are allowed
more freedom to show off, while
bassman Jamie Stewart takes his
usual unobtrusive role. Session
drummer Mickey “Why doesn’t
this band get a permanent drum-
mer" Curry hits with the lead-
weight sound of a young John Bo-
nham, Well...almost!

Speaking of Bonzo, the band
sounds very Zeppelin-esque on
several cuts, like "Medicine Train"
and the "Black Dog" sound-alike,
"Automatic Blues". But the albu-
m’s most Zep-like tune is "Soul
Asylum",. The pulsing guitar licks
and chromatic bass line make you
expect the boys to launch into an
80’s remix of "Kashmir". So
does the drum track, which con-
tains the largest hi-hat crash in the
history of recorded sound. The
albums hardest rockers are "New
York City", on which master
growler Iggy Pop makes an

appearance, and the back-slapping
"Soldier Blue." I can’t tell you
about them. They’re just too
mean.

The real surprise cut on Sonic
Temple is "Eddie (Ciao, Baby)",
The Cult’s entry into the booming
"power ballad" market. The song
begins with a minor key, 12-string
acoustic line backed by a full or-
chestra. The unexpected smooth-
ness of Astbury’s tenor crooning
jumps at you, and the overall ef-
fect of the tune is that of a classic
ballad by Styx (what?!) or E.L.O.
(double what?!) The track does
rock, too. "So do you like it?"
"Yes," he said.

Enough talk. This album kicks
%$#. If you’re a Cult initiate, or
even a novice in this order, you’ll
worship Sonic Temple. To quote
Astbury, "Shake, you sinners," and
buy it. Andy “The Killer" Keller
digs it, too. When do they tour?

social statement number one Costello points
out the fallacy in equating money with
happiness and how sad it is that genius has to
be threatening before it is recognized.

“‘Let Him Dangle,’ an eerie disturbing
song whose chorus of ‘“‘let him dangle, let
him dangle’’ follows every four lines, is a
morbid song about a man who gets convicted

 

is, however, the genius of the song comcs
through the lyrics. God’s fool dics and goes
to heaven where he sees God sitting ‘‘on a
water-bed/ drinking a cola of an mystery
brand/ Reading an airport novelette, listening
to Andrew Lloyd Webber’s ‘Requiem.’ He
said, before it had really begun, ‘I prefer the
one about my son’/ ‘I’ve been wading through

Margaret Thatcher, her foreign policy and her
tactics of defense.

“‘When England was the whore of the
world, Margeret was her madam’’ is the lyric
that opens the second verse. ‘‘Well I hope
that she sleeps well at night, isn’t haunted by
every tiny detail/ ‘Cos when she held that
lovely face in her hands all she thought of

the ballads on Spike is ‘‘Baby Plays
Around,’’ a wonderful, easy going song that
Linda Ronstadt could easily include on her
next Nelson Riddle album. Most of the song’s
beauty comes from its musical simplicity
though; that is, the sweet mix between
Costello’s voice and his guitar.

Costello picks up the tempo in ‘“‘Miss

but sad track called ‘‘Last Boat Leaving’’ that
deals with a man’s having to leave his wife
and child to fight in a war he doesn’t want to
fight. As he leaves he knows he’ll never
return and he tells his small child to take care
of his mother.

Elvis Costello proves on Spike that his is

be a commercial wonder to achieve such a
status. He examines more than ever before the

It is very seldom that I buy popular music
on compact disc but Spike is music I knew I
had to have on CD the second I heard it.
Costello’s musical magic is tireless and will
offer the same listening enjoyment and
excitement on the fiftieth play that it does on
the first. Spike is simple genius. Perhaps
that’s why it makes such a jarring statement.
