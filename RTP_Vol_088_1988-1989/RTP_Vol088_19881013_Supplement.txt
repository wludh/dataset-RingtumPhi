Guadalcanal Diary

 

From Elektra Records press

Having emerged unscathed
from the recent ‘‘holy wars’’ con-
troversy, Guadalcanal Diary con-
tinues to enjoy the success of their
third LP, subtly titled 2X4. Like a
Waffle House sign in the early
hours of Sunday morning, 2X4
shines with a promise of hope for
a wicked world. Produced by Don
Dixon (Smithereens, R.E.M.,
Marti Jones, Marshall Crenshaw),
the newest album marks a return
to the high-octane rock and roll
that brought this Georgia band out
of the boondocks to take on the
world.

Guadalcanal Diary’s original
members have been driving a
funny car in the fast lane of show-
biz since their humble beginnings
in 1981, playing for a friend’s
wedding. The group is a proud
product of Marietta, Georgia, nes-
tled in the same festering Bible
Belt which unleashed both rock
and roll and fundamentalist reli-
gion on an unsuspecting world.

Guadalcanal Diary released
their first vinyl in 1983, an EP tit-
led Watusi Rodeo, produced by
Bruce Baxter for E.O.D. Records.
Manager Warren Chilton shot a
low-bodgetcinema-verite video
that became an underground
classic, drawing praise from such
diverst sources as MTV and the
American Film Institute. In 1984

came the debut LP, Walking in the
Shadow of the Big Man (DB Re-
cords), recorded and mixed by
Don Dixon in an incredible 50
hours--‘‘totally drug- free.’’ The
band is quick to add, “except for
coffee and the occasional pencil.’’
On the basis of the album’s im-
pressive sales and laudatory re-
views as well as the band’s blister-
ing live shows, Elektra Records
signed Guadalcanal Diary in May,
1985 and issued a remastered ver-
sion of Big Man as the first release
under the new contract.

. Relentless touring of the United
States led to a European trek in the
fall of 85, where the gospel of the
Diary was preached to waiting
heathens in England, Sweden,
Norway, Germany, Switzerland,
France and Holland. A second
album, Jamboree, was released in
1986. Produced by Rodney Mills
(Cruzados, Greg Allman), this
wildly eclectic set only made it
more difficult for critics to hang
an easy label on Guadalcanal
Diary.

Having established themselves
as the highest-paid entertainers in
Las Vegas (and having sold more
records than Roger Whitaker and
Zamfir combined), Guadalcanal
Diary withdrew from the spotlight
of stardom in June, 1987 to record
2X4. In the depths of Atlanta’s
Axis Studios, far from the gla-

mour and tinsel, the champagne
and flashbulbs, band and producer
worked together to achieve the
perfect Vulcan mind-meld. As
Don Dixon notes, ‘*We had three
weeks longer to ruin this one than
we had to make Big Man.”’

The resulting album is a high-
water mark for Guadalcanal
Diary, combining the foursome’s

characteristically tongue-in-cheek
black humor with Dixon’s bril-
liantly buoyant production.
Through songs that explore me-
chanization and childhood super-
stitions, T.V. evangelism and
youth-targeted advertising, 2X4’s
lyrical themes are borne on music
that is fittingly jubilant, driving
and confident. The opening track,

‘“‘Litany (Life Goes On),’’ is an
ebullient anthem to life eternal
which sets the tone for the whole
LP. From the punishing crunch of
*‘Under the Yoke’’ to the driving
call-and-response of ‘‘Get Over
It,”’ these twelve songs snap,
crackle and pop until ‘‘Lips of
Steel’’ closes the set in a wash of
neo-Jet Age psychedelia.

ducer/engineer John Jansen
(Supertramp, Cutting Crew) says:
‘They are all of the above: a
synth/guitar pop rock dance
band—with a quirky sense of
humor.’’ But to the audience
they’re simply the Producers.
Since 1980 the Producers have
played a sprightly, ironic brand of
power pop. Signed by Portrait
after a single audition: with pro-

ducer Tom Werman (‘‘It was the
best live audition ever done for
me. I knew midway through the
third song I wanted them.’’), the
band put out a debut album re-
markable for its energy, melodies
and good spirits. The band had a
couple or regional singles and
enough MTV rotation to be in-
vited to perform at the first ever
MTV ‘‘New Year’s Eve Party’’.
‘What viewers saw that night was a
fresher, more energetic take on
bands like Cheap Trick, The Cars
or The Knack; a band that played
sugarpop to the hilt, but whose na-
tural abilities and emotional con-
cerns were leading them instinc-
tively to aspire to pop music’s
more serious side.

In 1982, The Producers came
out with a beefed-up sound, more
mature lyrics, a tougher poplook
and their strongest single to date
(‘‘She Sheila’). This was fol-
lowed (in retrospect) by the dues-

paying the band avoided with their
seemingly effortless signing to
Portrait. They became the quites-
sential road band, packing in lyal
crowds on the strength of their
new albums, live zaniness and
word of mouth.

After two years of this, bassist
Kyle Henderson left to pursue in-
dividual musical directions; he
was replaced by Tim Smith. The
band recorded and marketed an
independent LP in 1985 (Run For
Your Life) that contained a strong
ballad (‘‘Waiting on a Train’’),
but which also revealed an un-
characteristic slump in_ their
trademark humor and energy—a
result, no doubt, of the road’s
wear and tear.

Now, all that is about to change,
because The Producers, who
seemlessly melded pop, rock,

Scheduling is key to football success

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

I went to the Virginia Tech/South
Carolina football game last Satur-
day in Blacksburg. It was Home-
coming Weekend for the Hokies
and, despite all the typical revelry
and hoopla that accompany a foot-
ball game (even more so for
Homecoming), there was a sense
of dread among the Tech faithful.
You see, the Cocks (as they are
so affectionately nicknamed) were
coming into the contest ranked
eighth in the nation, led by quar-
terback and Heisman trophy can-
didate Todd Ellis. Not exactly a
big morale booster for the home
team.

Tech almost beat ‘em, losing
26-24, but that’s not the point.
The point is that the Hokies
shouldn’t have had to worry about
beating anyone on Homecom-
ing—they should be playing
someone easy, like VMI. Every-
one’s doing it. South Carolina
took on Appalachian St. (who?) in
its Homecoming a week earlier,
not exactly a contender for the
national championship. Two years
ago East Carolina played some-
thing like five Homecoming
games, .its own and four other
teams’. We’re talking cream-puff
city here, and not the kind you get
at County Kitchen.

Since I’ve come to W&L, the
Generals are 1-2 in Homecoming
affairs, winning my freshman year
while dropping the last two in a
row. Overall, since non-scholar-

ship athletics came into existence,
the Generals are 17-14-2. Not
exactly a record that sets the old
pulse racing, eh?

On Saturday, the W&L wel-
comes that oasis of masculinity,
Hampden-Sydney, to Wilson
Field. The Squids last week
played Emory and Henry tough,
losing 21-14. Far be it for me to
say the Generals can’t win this
game (In fact, I am extremely op-
timistic about W&L’s chances.
But remember, everything I think
and do is drug-induced), but why
should the outcome even be in
doubt?

Let’s bring in East Poedunk U.
for Homecoming. Or Joe Blow St.
How about Roanoke? (Whoops, I
forgot. The Maroons are too civi-
lized to have a football team)
Well, ship their I-M champs up
here. Does Mary Baldwin have a
football program? (Strike that.
That wasn’t very nice.) Aca-
demics? I don’t care if the school
we schedule doesn’t even require
the SAT’s for admission (Sydney
falls into that category anyway,
doesn’t it?). I want a win—a vic-
tory—a big ‘W’. And I don’t want
it to be close. I want a good old-
fashioned butt-whupping.

It doesn’t matter if the Generals
go 1-8 on the year. If the win is on
Homecoming, the season is a suc-
cess. Picture it. All those alumni
make the trek to Lexington for one
weekend, go to the concert on
Friday night (well, maybe not),
wake up at noon the next day,
somehow get to Wilson Field be-

dance and new music into a cros-
sover dream in 1981, who were
simply too far ahead of the segre-
gated radio playlists of 1982, have
arrived—mature, seasoned with a
stlye based on as well honed
commercial sense and a forever-
young desire to do something
new. Which is to say, The Pro-
ducers haven’t drifted aimlessly
with the times—no, the times have
come to them.

Although based in Atlanta, the
band has managed throughout its
career to avoid the region’s two
biggest musical cliches; dual
guitar duels and jangly retro psy-
chedelia. And no wonder: guita-
rist/lead vocalist Van Temple still
remains awed by The Beatles,
keyboardist Wayne Famous by
Hendrix and classic Stax/Volt
R&B. Drummer Bryan Holmes
gravitates toward fatbak soul and
T Williams-ish mania, while

bassist Tim Smith heads toward
Austrailia (Split Enz, Crowded
House) and XTC.

What emerges from these dis-
parate influences isCoelacanth, an
LP of crisp, imaginative musical
style anchored by pop tradition yet
wide open to some ‘‘left wing’’
effects of jazz, soul or under-
ground pop. This desire to push
themselves and go beyond their
earlier work also touches their lyr-
ics; love songs with more emo-
tional complexity (‘‘After All Is
Said and Done’’), bold spiritual
statements (‘‘Renaissance’’) and
the compelling questioning of
man’s true nature (‘‘Primitive
Man’’).

Although the contents of Coela-
canth aren’t as mysterious as its ti-
tle, they both point toward one
thing: if you are ahead of your
time, it can only mean that some
day, you time will come. For The
Producers, as the old Chambers
Brothers’ song goes, that ‘‘time
has come today.””

Next year?

    

The Lexington High School football team would be a real challenge for next year’s Homecoming game.

fore 1:30, and then get to see the
Generals kick some ass. Hell, this
way no one can get upset when the
people leave at halftime. There
will be a legitimate reason. W&L
will be so far ahead the game will
already be over.

Guaranteed wins have been a
part of football scheduling for
years. You say its unethical? What
is this, a philosophy class? I don’t
think anyone would care if we
played St. George’s School for thé
Blind, as long as we come away
with the victory. There’s nothing
more enjoyable than seeing your
home team pound some weakling
into submission. Think about it.
All the players’ stats will be bet-
ter, the starters can rest up for that

night’s parties, and the W&L
Sports Information Director can
sleep easier at nights.

If all this doesn’t persuade you,
consider the good-time theory.
Here’s how it works. From Friday
afternoon until Sunday morning,
having a good time is top priority.
If the Generals lose, than every-
one’s fun is stopped (albeit for
only a short while, because I’m
sure, for most people, having a
good time does not hinge on the
outcome of the football game).
With a cream-puff opponent,
W&L wins big and everyone goes
home happy. Everybody’s good
time is uninterrupted. This results
in a continuous good time (the
premium of good times), and also

stops people from blaming coedu-
cation for our lack of football
prowess.

People go to football games for
excitement and school com-
raderie. What could be better than
seeing the Generals light up the
scoreboard- against a team like,
say, Southern Sem? (Whoops,
strike number two. Again, that
wasn’t very nice) a

By consciously selecting a
featherweight football team for
their Homecoming opponent, the
Generals can pad their record and
a good time can be had by all. And
isn’t that what this weekend is all
about?

(As I said before, it’s all drug-
induced)
