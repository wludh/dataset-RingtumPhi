A Fancy Dress message from the President

February 20, 1989

Fancy Dress Weekend is a special moment in the University's calendar.
For some 82 years it has provided a burst of color and excitement to help

us all bid winter farewell and to welcome in the spring.

It is always a

treat to anticipate and, when it comes, to enjoy to the fullest. Faculty,
staff, and alumni all look forward to joining the students of the University

in this traditional event.

I know how very hard the work has been--how many hours, how much effort

and strain--to bring us to this point. On behalf of the thousands who will
be on hand, I express sincere gratitude to the members of SAB and especially
to the Fancy Dress organizers and volunteers who will shortly create for us
yet another memorable evening. We are really most deeply grateful.

An Evening Excursion on the
Orient Express is 82nd theme

 

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Ladies and Gentlemen of the
Washington and Lee communi-
ty, the theme for the 82nd annual
Fancy Dress Ball is An Evening
Excursion on the Orient Ex-
press.

This year’s Fancy Dress
moves away from the place and
time balls of the past few years
and will again focus on the fine
and the elegant; the fancy if you
will. Everything chosen for this
year’s ball was chosen for its
quality, its distinction and for its
style. In short, An Evening on
the Orient Express should be the
finest Fancy Dress Ball that any
of us have experienced and one
of the finest W&L has ever seen.

As always, huge, bright
spotlights will criss-cross the
skies outside the Warner Center
signaling the beginning of an-
other Fancy Dress while banners
of gold and black hang from
each of the windows on the side
of the gym above the walkway.
Art deco edges will outline the
silhouetted dancers on each of
the 3 by 22 foot banners. A
pathway of lights underneath the
wall of banners will lead to the
red carpeted stairway flanked by
lighted trees at the front of the
Warner Center. Above the

doorway at the top of the stair-
way a sign of indigo, red and
gold highlighted by two
spotlights and numerous marquis
lights will read An Evening Ex-
cursion on the Orient Express.

Once you are inside the door-
way, professional costumed
security guards will take your
Fancy Dress ticket and will
stamp it with the official stamp
of the Venice-Simplon Orient
Express; the actual Orient Ex-
press that currently runs between
London and Venice.

In the right quadrant of the
lobby, a facade of a ticket
counter like that in Victoria
Station will stand with old lug-
gage, trunks and brass luggage
dollies. The hallways leading to
the Warner Center and Doremus
Gymnasium will be covered in a
dark royal blue paper with gold
trim. Various crests associated
with the Orient Express made
from gold paper will also adorn
the walls.

Across the hallway from the
doors closest to the ad-
ministrative athletic offices will
sit a Viennese garden with
various floral decor, trellises and
benches.

As you enter the Warner
Center, the Lester Lanin Or-
chestra will be sitting at the far

end of the gym. Behind it will
hang flags from Italy, England,
France, Austria, Turkey,
Switzerland and Hungary; all the
countries through which the
Orient Express runs. Gold
metallic streamers will scoop
down from and across the rafters
while lines of miniature white
lights of varying lengths hang
from the ceiling across the gym.

This year the Warner Center
will be divided into four cities,
each occupying a_ different
corner of the gym. Looking into
the Warner Center from the
doorway Zurich, Switzerland
will be in the left front corner,
Paris, France will be in the right
front corner, London, England
will be in the left rear corner and
Istanbul, Turkey will be in the
right rear corner.

The Zurich showcase will
feature paper mache facades of
the Alps that will rise up into the
bleachers. Small Swiss cottages
will sit at the bottom of the
make-believe mountains.

The Paris corner will feature a
20 foot tall model of the Eiffel
Tower that will be outlined in
miniature white lights. Foun-
tains set about four feet off the
floor will surround the bottom of
the tower in addition to various
greenery.

The London section will
feature a model of the London
Bridge with an illusion of the
Thames River flowing under it.
In addition, a facade of Big Ben
will rise up in the background
next to the bleachers.

Finally, the Turkey portion
will feature a gold Mosque or
Turkish temple that will be ac-
cented by red stained glass
windows.

On the wali opposite the Or-
chestra below the balcony will
hang the picture of the railway
platform of a train station. Signs
heading up each of the staircases
will read ‘*To Platform A’’ and
**To Platform B.’’ Once on top
of the balcony, you can see one
of the most exciting things about
this year’s ball - an exact, actual-
size replica of the bar/salon car
from the Continental Train of
the Orient Express. The 10 by
40 foot car will sit next to the
railing looking over the gym, but
the side of the car to the inside of
the balcony will open like a
cross-section giving viewers a
look at the intricacies and detail
of the car’s inside. Like in the
actual car, a pianist will play on
a full-size piano for added enter-
tainment on the balcony level.

The walls of the smaller
Doremus gym will be decorated

with art deco banners similar to
the ones that will hang next to
the walkway outside the gym. A
facade of a train with silhouetted
passengers will line the outside
of the railing that runs around
the track above the floor.
Throughout the course of the
Ball a light will run around the
inside of the railing illuminating
the silhouetted passengers as if
the train were actually moving
around the track.

The stage for the Young Fresh
Fellows and The Reivers will
again sit on the side of the gym
opposite the doors next to the
administrative offices. In addi-
tion, authentic cigarette girls
with cigarette boxes filled with
gum, matches, mints, cigars and
cigarettes will survey the floor
throughout the course of the
ball.

Then as the ball comes to a
close around 12:30 a.m. a
fireworks display will shoot up
over Wilson Field lasting for
about 30 minutes. All in all, it
promises to be extremely
memorable and exciting.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
Welcome to An Evening Excur-
sion on the Orient Express, the
82nd annual Fancy ‘Dress Ball at
Washington and Lee University.
Let the festivities begin.

The Long and Winding Fancy Dress Road

 

By Marshall Bosweli
Alumni Staff Reporter

 

The official date given for the
first Fancy Dress Ball is Febru-
ary 1907. That's eighty-two
years ago for those of you
without a calculator. But that’s
not necessarily eighty-two Fancy
Dress Balls. Indeed, the history
of our little winter term shindig
is rich with anecdote and cultural
significance.

It is appropriate that we look
back at the origins of Fancy
Dress on this, its eighty-second
birthday. Although the common
belief is that a one Miss Annie Jo
White started FD all those years
ago, actually the idea of a major
ball was brewing long before her
initial efforts.

The first reference to a
‘Fancy Dress’’ anythingwas a
blurb in the September 27, 1876
issue of the Southern Collegian
concerning a ‘‘Fancy Dress
Hop.’’ For nearly a decade
before that, however, students
here had been putting on dances
and hops—without sanction from
the university—in off- campus
buildings, stables, or wherever a

band could set up and folks
could cut a rug or two. These
hops met with profound disap-
proval from campus authorities,
but the kids kept at it.

In December of 1871, the Col-
legian sent a reporter to W&L to
cover a hop put on by a
mysterious group of men calling
themselves, appropriately
enough, the ‘‘Student Social
Club.’’ The reporter described
the men as ‘‘elegantly dressed,”’
while the women these fellows
were lucky enough to be escor-
ting were dubbed ‘‘simply
bewitching.”’

**The Fancy Dress Hop’ that
followed several years later was
called a ‘‘great success’’ by the
Collegian and this inspired a
series of similar endeavors, the
most creative of which was the
*‘Finals Ball’’ held during exam
week of 1879. The Collegian
reporter complained that this
particular dance was simply too
short: it ended at 3 a.m..

Public sentiment was in
violent opposition to this new in
terest in balls and hops.

Protestant churches and
trustees rose up in anger against
this “‘licentious”’ flurry of activi-
ty. One fellow, observing the
1879 commencement exercises,
said he ‘feared the passing of
old times.’” He went on to say,
‘‘What would ‘Stonewall’
Jackson think of the youth in
Lexington dancing to the licen-
tious german or disgusting
racket?’’ Lastly, he worried that
the girls were doing simply to
much hugging.

Even the Gazette concurred,
writing ‘‘The time has come for
the public sentiment of the
Christian people of Lexington to
discountenance the lascivious
dancing which we are sorry to
say is being introduced here. ”’

But iocal satirist
*G.Whilikins, fought back with
these wise words: ‘‘As long as
there is music and young folks, it
will get (sic) into their
toes...Girls like to be hugged,
and the boys like to hug them.
The question is whether it is
better to do it in the ballroom or
behind the door.”’

The first real Fancy Dress Ball
came a decade later. The
school’s then-current librarian,
Miss Annie Jo White, entertain-
ed a group of her student friends
with a costume party one Febru-
ary evening in 1907. Because
she felt that the students needed
something to spark up the mid-
winter dullness, she sought to
make the affair an annual event.

It took some doing, but she
eventually rustled up enough
student enthusiasm to make the
Fancy Dress Ball one of the
highlights of the W&L social
calendar. Miss White was the
undisputed Queen of Fancy
Dress for 13 years, and in later
years was even paid $50 for her
services.

It was after her death in 1922,
however, that the Fancy Dress
Ball really took off. By 1928,
The New York Timesdescribed it
as ‘‘the South’s outstanding col-
legiate social event,’ even
though that ball was something
entirely different from the event
we celebrate now. For starters,

it was a costume ball, elaborate
and glittering, With exotic
European themes. setting the
pace. Famous big bands fre-
quented the ball and the music
was routinely broadcast on net-
work radio hook-ups all over the
nation. Fancy Dress, it has been
observed, began the same year
Henry Ford was working on the
first Model T: it was the
quintessence of the Edwardian
Age.

Fancy Dress was elaborate,
aristocratic, imaginative and
even perhaps snobbish. But it
was born out of an earnest desire
to create a wonderland here on
campus, and more often than
not, succeeded.

There were no Fancy Dress
Balls during the second World
War, and the tradition didn’t
quite survive the turbulent Six-
ties, but through it all, Fancy
Dress just seems to keep cropp-
ing up every winter like a breath
of fresh air.

Off to the ballroom, ladies and
gentlemen.

Freshman Perspective

 

Female

By Pam Kelley
W&L Freshman

 

 

Well, what to do about the big
“*F word” is no longer a dilem-
ma: I received a bid for Fancy
Dress. Where does it all go from
here? As a freshman, I’ve ab-
solutely no idea what goes on
during Fancy Dress weekend; so
I decided I would collect infor-

mation on ‘“‘F.D.’’, as_ it’s
called, and piece it together for
myself.

I asked the brothers of the
fraternity house I’m going to for
F.D. to tell me what will be go-
ing on for the most part: I got a
lot of stories about girl friend
swapping and incidents that are

Sophomore Perspective

juicy tidbits for games like ‘‘I
never.’’ TheSe stories basically
hint at the underlying itinerary
for the weekend, I think.

As for the formal itinerary, of
course there will be a Thursday
night concert, followed by ‘‘the
big night on Friday,’ then the
houses will part ways and create
their own activities. These ac-
tivities, combined with the in-
formal itinerary, amount to what
one person described to me as a
*‘drunken fest.”’

Of course, after these
enlightenments and revelations I
have to admit that my previous,
characteristically freshman vi-
sions of ‘‘moonlight and roses”’

have somewhat changed. I am,
however, looking forward to
Fancy Dress. I mean I’ve got a
great date, he’s got great friends
who we'll party with, they’ve
probably got great friends, and
we'll all probably all get along
even better when everyone gets
in the FD spirit. I am, however,
a little skeptical about this date-
swapping thing...

I also decided though, after all
of my sleuthing that what will
happen at Fancy Dress is the
least of my worries, I mean I’ve
got to get those shoes dyed to
match my fabulous dress and
think about accessories, possible
nail polish colors and....

As we were walking to the
party, I popped the question.

‘*Hey,’’ I smoothly said, **do
you want to go the FD with
me?”’

She looked at me and
hesitated. As she was thinking of
a reply, my mind scanned
through the names of other peo-
ple. ‘‘What if I don’t get a
date?’’ I pondered.

“Well, I don’t know,’’ she
said.

**What do you mean you don’t
know,”’ I exclaimed.

“OK, I'll go...I guess,’’ she
said.

‘*Wonderful,’” I thought.
‘**My date to the biggest week-
end of my life guesses that she
will go with me.”

**All right,’ I thought. ‘‘Two
weeks to Fancy Dress. Time to

make dinner reservations, get
flowers, buy tickets and get my
tux cleaned.”’

Unfortunately, my date in-
formed me that she had tests un-
til Friday afternoon and would
come up around 6 p.m.. Tests,
right.

She ended up coming to W&L
at about 7:45 p.m., we never ate
dinner, I forgot to buy flowers,
well, basically we hated each
other.

The first thing she said to me
when she arrived was that she
had made other sleeping ar-
rangements with a girlfriend of
hers in another W&L guy’s
room. So my first Fancy Dress
was Off to a terrible start but the
funny thing was that I really
didn’t care because my date
wasn’t looking too hot and the
next stop was the fraternity
cocktail party. Even funnier,
after I had indulged myself at the

cocktail party she wasn’t looking
any better.

We finally made it to the ball
at about 10:30 p.m. where I, ah,
unintentionally lost my date.
After talking to some friends of
mine and dancing with other
girls, I decided I should find her.
When I found her she said that
she was tired, had a headache
and wanted to leave. I walked
her to her friend’s room and then
proceeded to my fraternity house
where I concerned myself with
forgetting the evening.

The next morning my date
showed up for brunch at the
house and after eating heartily,
left with her girlfriend to go to
another fraternity party. After
she left I decided that the morn-
ing deserved to be forgotten just
as much as the night before.

I didn’t see my date again until
10 p.m. that night at our band
party. She only stayed about ten
minutes and then left. It was the
last I would see of her. But again
I didn’t really care because my
beer goggles were setting in and
there were plenty of other
women around.

Overall though Fancy Dress
was a great weekend, that is,
when I wasn’t with my date. I’m
really looking forward to this
year’s FD. I can only hope that
my date will be more bearable.

I’ve heard quite a lot about the
Fancy Dress Ball and I’ve seen
the posters and T-shirts, but I
still don’t know quite exactly
what to expect next week. The
closest thing I have to compare
Fancy Dress to is my senior
prom but from what I’ve heard,
however, FD has been much
more extravagant in the past than
any high school prom. I mean
we never had big name bands
like The Fixx in high school, and
none of our social events lasted
from Wednesday until Saturday
night as does Fancy Dress.

Some upperclassmen have
also been telling me about the

The Second Time Around.
From the very beginning, we all
knew our sophomore year would
be different. The excitement of
being a freshman and the atten-
tion associated with being a new
face on campus were gone. A
crowd of entirely new faces had
appeared, just when we thought
we knew everyone.

Depressing as it was, we were
no longer the center of attention,
and we had to learn to deal with
it. We adjusted also to no longer
being part of a freshman dorm
hall, with all our classmates
within a short jog across the
quad, and no longer being forced
to eat our meals together in
Evans. The good aspects of these
*‘privileges’’ were obvious; we
had been longing to be out of the
dorms and out of a permanent
ticket to the dining hall.

The catch though — and there
always is a catch — was that we
would no longer see many of the
people who wereonce just down
the hall, across the quad, or right
downstairs.

The impact of this may have
been minimal to some, but I
know I had taken for granted the
idea that we'd all still be
together. Now I’m lucky if I see

Special FD Memories

tendency of students to not at-
tend class on Friday. I think I’m
looking forward to that quick
break more than anything.

Yeah, when I think about it,
nothing we ever did in high
school could hold a candle to
Fancy Dress.

Fancy Dress of course will be
fine and dandy but my expenses
next week will also be far above
any high school Friday night
costs I have ever paid. Sure,
proms are expensive, but by the
time I pay for tickets, dinners,
flying my girlfriend in from
Texas and other assorted ex-
penses, I’ll need to take out a
loan.

It will probably be worth it all
though. I guess I'll find out
when it’s all over.

some of the people who were on
my hall last year once a week on
the hill.

What does all this have to do
with Fancy Dress? Well, to tell
you the truth I’m not really sure
myself. However, perhaps the
sophomore’s perspective may
now be better understood. Thus
far, all we've had to compare
our W&L experiences to have
been the relics of the freshman
year. Looking upon Fancy Dress
this year, some of the excitement
must still be there.

Fancy Dress itself is supposed
to be special, and the fact that
your date is someone special
lend themselves to creating at
least a little thrill. I suppose a bit
depends on your F.D. experi-
ences Freshman year. I'll try not
to hold that up as a standard of
comparison, though, because it
would be very difficult to top.

By this point, I think we’ve
pretty much adjusted to the fact
that the sophomore year is just
“‘there’’ unless you make
something more of it. Now I
think we’re ready to give Fancy
Dress a whirl, and to see how,
with a new attitude or an extra
effort, we can make this year
special in a way we had never
thought it could be.

Junior Perspective

 

Female

By Lori Richardson
W&L Junior

 

 

It’s FD season. Like the first
day of hunting season, you can
hear the dating calls beginning
the week after Winter Break.
W&L men search for the perfect
date, the dates search for the
perfect dress, the SAB wants the
perfect decorations and all an-
ticipate the perfect time. FD is
one of the most memorable oc-
casions at W&L. But, even so,
something could go wrong.

My freshman year, everything
that could have...did. First, the
boy who I had wanted to ask me
(a crush from the first week of
school no less), didn’t. The math
test (not my strong suit) sched-
uled for 2 p.m. Friday was a
nice bit of foreshadowing of the
weekend to come as well. Next
mistake, taking the plunge into
one of the local beauty salons
(using the word lightly) to get
what I thought was going to be a
manicure. One hour of gossip-
about-people-I-don’t-know later,

my nails were covered in horri-
ble swirling pools of orange mud
polish. It took another hour for
my roommate and I to undo the
damage.

It took about three girls to
force on the previously perfect-
fitting dress over a body that had
been consuming various drinks
for about three hours. A slight
loss of hand-eye coordination
may have made things a bit more
difficult too. In addition, I made
the dreadful mistake of wearing
a full length gown with zillions
of petticoats. Taking up most of
the compact car in which we
drove to Doremus made seeing
out the front and side windows a
true challenge for me and for the
driver. NO joke.

The picture of politeness the
entire week, my Jekyll/Hyde
date must have been transformed
by the sight of the dazzling
spotlights and not-so-dazzling
baby elephant that greeted us at
the front door. Things went
downhill...fast. To make a long
story short, a friend of his ended

up walking me home. (With en-
thusiastic permission from my
date of course!) I quickly went in
search of my roommate at her
date’s fraternity house. The
morning after overly-drowning
my sorrows, I had my first Alka-
Seltzer. (Ever try putting one of
those in your mouth by mistake?
Don’t!)

I knew I never wanted to see
Mr. Hyde again. He never
wanted to see me again either.
What a disaster! What happened
next? Venturing to the fraternity
house of a friend, I stumbled
upon the boy I had been dying to
have ask me. It turned out, he
hadn’t asked anyone. | was so
excited to hear that. We danced
the night away, which more than
made up for the previous night’s
fiasco. Now he tells me he had
wanted to ask me, but thought I
wasn’t interested. (Typical,
huh?) This year, he asked some-
one, I think about a month ago.
Lucky girl. I accepted in a heart-
beat. This year, FD will finally
be perfect.

Senior Perspective

 

Male

By Kevin Struthers
WA&L Senior

 

Before I matriculated as a
freshman in the Fall of 1985, I
had already heard about Fancy
Dress. This was not just a dance,
this was the dance and the social
event of the year. My father,
who attended Randolph-Macon
College, Ashland, even made a
road trip during the 1940s to
crash the dance. I was prepared
to encounter the most elegant
and lavish event of the year:
Washington and Lee's Fancy
Dress Ball. Carnaval was quite a
spectacle. I enjoyed the entire
evening, but it wasn’t quite what
I had in mind as a ‘‘ball’’ in the
Cinderella sense. What I en-
countered were a number of
students attempting to awkward-
ly dance like their parents
through a wall-to-wall inch of
beer slosh, hazardous to all
shoes and long dresses.

Gone are the days of ‘*wet”’
Fancy Dress, perhaps to the
chagrin of the University
Cleaners. Beer was served at
The Dark Continent, the Ball of
1987, but not on the main dance
floor. Instead, it was served in
what the SAB called a ‘*Beer
Garden.”* It was in this re-
stricted area, on the balcony
overlooking the new gym, that I
had my most memorable Fancy
Dress experience.

My former girlfriend and I
were in the Beer Garden with
what appeared to be every other
person at the ball. Lots of
smoke, lots of beer, lots of
bodies. It seemed like a typical
frat party, except everybody was
dressed to kill. All present were
trying in vain to look as dry and
comfortable as they could,
which was not easy in twenty-
five layers of tuxedo and taffeta.
Again, the floor was hazardous
to all, except for those who like
to take beer baths.

We had just arrived a few
minutes earlier from a cocktail
party where my date had maybe
one drink, one and a half Cape
Cods at the most. At this party
she had a few cheese and
crackers, but she really hadn’t
eaten anything all day. We were
standing in the back of the
balcony, away from the railing
next to a wall decorated with
bright splattered paint and a few
bulky, awkward palm-tree-type
objects. Everything was just
fine, and then it happened. I
looked over and I saw a mass of
black velvet sprawled on the
floor in the muck. She had
passed out cold.

I tried to wake her, but it was
to no avail. A couple of my
friends picked her up and tried to
walk her around a little bit,
while | tried to figure out what to
do. Trying to act casual, suave
and debonair as one’s FD date is

passed out amidst the entire stu-
dent body is not easy. There was
no place to walk - the front of the
balcony was packed, and the
stairs leading up from the gym
floor were filled with two steady
streams of thirsty bodies, all
heading upstairs, of course.
Finally, two SAB security
men came over and said,**Hey,
she looks like she’s had quite
enough.’’ So off they carry my
date, with me trailing behind
them as they walk out the back
steps. Behind me followed three
other couples who had joined us
at the ball. This was not a good
way to try to avoid being notic-
ed. ‘‘Give her another drink.”’

changed. From being the eager

My freshman year, I was real-
ly fired up about Fancy Dress.
That was all people had been
talking about throughout the
winter term. Before winter
break, I gave a_ half-hearted
effort at looking for a date, even
though I knew all along that I
was going to bring up my red-
headed hometown honey. Sure
enough. on Thursday of THE
week, she showed up at the
Roanoke airport. Friday night
was great. However, Saturday
just wasn’t to be. She drank too
much and proceeded to whine a
lot, not that I did, so I gladly sent
her on her way on Sunday. Still,
not all things were that bad, if
you know what I mean, and she
had paid for the plane ticket.

Sophomore year, | was all
ready to ask this one chick who I
felt | owed something to (who
will remain nameless). Then,
when I got home from break, I
had several people tell me that

**She ought to be fun tonight.”’
**Look at her - go let her throw
up, she'll feel better.’ That’s all
I heard as we passed what seem-
ed like two zillion W&L
students, staff and alumni. The
entire time, I of course was try-
ing to act concerned, yet still try-
ing to maintain that **No, I'm
not embarrassed”’ look.

As our entourage started down
the back steps a rush of cold out-
side air blew up the stairwell.
My date started to come to,
much to my relief. As we sat
down outside on the front steps
of the Warner Center, a baby

back wall, to now ducking into
dark corners when I hear Liz
Smith’s or David Grove’s voice
because I have yet to sign up for
SAB hours. Also, I remember
dashing through Graham-Lees to
see if my friends got ‘‘the bid’’
from their favorite senior
crushes while this year my
roommate is attending the Ball
with her fiance (watch out, he
was her date sophomore year,
this too could happen to you).
The one thing that has not
changed about F.D. is the good
times had with my friends and
the escape from academic

that week. Don’t worry, I wasn’t
that upset, but I did realize that I
needed a date, and quick. |
called up an ‘‘ole’* buddy of
mine who I thought I was going
to have a fun time with. All she
did was cost me a fortune while
running around hugging
everybody she saw but me. I
probably didn’t see her for more
than several hours all weekend.

That now brings me to this
year. Even though I’ve had some
interesting experiences the last
two years, I'm really excited
about this one. I even asked a
sweet little freshman girl before
break, which is a miracle for
me. In concluding, I have just a
little’ advice for the
underclassmen - watch out for
the coppers. I’m not saying
whether I am speaking from per-
sonal experience or not, well
maybe I am, but they have been
known to make a few arrests
during the weekend. See you
there.

date later recalled, ‘‘Kevin, I
swear, everything was just fine,
I was standing beside you, then
everything went black. I don’t
remember anything after we
were upstairs. I just remember
awakening to the sight of a large,
swaggering baby elephant butt
complete with smell and leather
pantyhose skin!”

As one might imagine, it was
not a pleasant experience for
either one of us. You should
have heard what she said after
she examined her $300,

pressures it provides, even if it is
for only 4 or 5 days. During Sat-
urday afternoon parties, no one
is worried about stats problems
or history papers, the main
priority is to kick back and enjoy
the company of your friends. As
a senior, with most of my friends
running around like chickens
with their heads cut off, looking
for jobs or trying to figure out
what is going to happen after
June |, this is going to be a great
weekend to forget and have our
last hurrah. The weekend is go-
ing to be the best Fancy Dress
ever—but I don’t know, it is go-
ing to be hard to top last year!

Blues legend B.B. King

 

highlights Thursday night

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

It’s a long way from the cotton
plantations of Mississippi to the
sleepy town of Lexington,
Virginia. Especially if you take
the route that B.B. King has
taken.

Born Riley King in 1949 on a
cotton plantation in Mississippi,
the man we have all come to
know as ‘‘the King of the Blues”’
has transcended more barriers
than most of us will ever face.
After leaving Mississippi and
hitchhiking to Memphis, Ten-
nessee in 1947, King found his
first bit of success as a local disk
jockey calling himself ‘‘The
Beale Street Blues Boy’’ after
the address of the station. His
success as a DJ and as a per-
former led to a recording con-
tract with RPM records where
he recorded ‘‘Three O'Clock
Blues’’ in 1951, a rhythm and
blues hit that would go all the
way to number one.

From there, B.B. (‘Blues
Boy’’) King began building a
reputation and career in blues
and in the music industry that
few have equalled. It didn’t
come easily though. King learn-
ed quickly what ‘‘paying dues”’
was all about as he set out to
market his unique form of
music,

As a southern black man in the
1950s, however, King was
somewhat relegated to playing a
series of black clubs throughout
the south called ‘‘the chitlin cir-
cuit."’ For the next 15 years,
King entertained over 300 nights
a year in these clubs before final-
ly ‘crossing over’’ in 1966 with
a performance at San Fran-
cisco’s Filmore West with The
Rolling Stones. That perfor-
mance, just as Jackie Robinson’s
emergence on the baseball field
in 1947 smoothed the way for
the black athlete, helped build
the foundation for the
trancendence of the black enter-
tainer into the world of predom-
inantly white venues.

The Fabulous Wallers kick-off Fancy Dress

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

The opening night of the Fan-
cy Dress weekend is an exciting
event in itself, but when you
open the weekend with the
Fabulous Waller Family, it is
sure to be super exciting.

The Waller Family is a
brother/sister quintet from
Richmond who have put together
a live show that is second to

Since then, King has con-
tinued to build his career as both
a musician and as a humani-
tarian. Musically, King has re-
corded over 50 albums and has
won two Grammy awards;
awards which many believe are
the most prestigious in the music
business. He won his first
Grammy in 1971 for ‘*The Thrill
is Gone,’’ a single that would
later go platinum for selling over
one million copies. Then in 1982
he was honored again for his
1971 album There Must Be A
Better World Somewhere.

In addition to his two
Grammys, King has been
awarded numerous honors by
the NAACP, the B’Nai Brith
Humanitarian Award, The
Memphis State University Dis-
tinguished Achievement Award
given in memory of Elvis
Presley in 1982, Top Blues
Guitarist by Guitar Player
magazine, Top Blues Artist by
Downbeat magazine in 1975 and
1976 and Best Male Instrumen-
talist and Best Male Blues Singer
by Ebonymagazine.

As a humanitarian, King has
traveled to more than fifty coun-
tries in North America, South
America, Europe, Australia,
Africa, the Middle East and
Asia. In 1979 he became the first
popular American singer to tour
the Soviet Union. Even though
the Russian people had never
heard any of King’s music, over
100,000 people showed up for
the concert.

King’s largest humanitarian
contribution, however, has been
his involvement with FAIRR,
the Foundation for the Ad-
vancement of Inmate Rehabilita-
tion and Recreation which King
founded with attorney F. Lee
Bailey. FAIRR was designed to
improve the morals and
rehabilitation efforts within the
prison systems through exposure
to the arts. In addition to his
guidance of the program, King
has given over 40 prison con-

certs across the United States.

will highlight the vocal talent of
the family group in addition to
the multiple costume changes
and tight choreography that have
become trademarks of their per-
formances.

Musically, they range from

‘Soul’? to ‘“‘Rhythm and
Blues,’” from ‘‘Funk’’ to
‘*Beach Music’’ and from ‘Big
Band Music”’ to the ‘Monsters

World-renowned blues artist B.B. King will be the highlight of Thursday night’s pavilion concert.

Since 1966, King and his best
friend, guitar Lucille, have con-
tinued to tour giving from 250 to
300 performances a year. Why?
Because he loves performing and
playing the blues.

‘*The people in Boston are go-
ing to see the best show I can put
on,”” he said in a recent Boston
newspaper article. ‘‘You can’t
go out there with any less emo-
tion today than you did 40 years
ago, an entertainer should never

Waller Family can perform just
about any form of popular
music. The Family’s repertoire
includes selections by Earth,
Wind & Fire, Gladys Knight,
Michael Jackson, Stevie
Wonder, Terence Trent D’ Arby,
Whitney Houston, Luther Van-
dross, Prince, The Time and a
special extended medley of
Motown impressions featuring
the music of The Pointer Sisters,

do that. You do what you have to
do to put on the best show you
can — each time. You never

You can rest assured that B.B.
King will hold nothing back
when he headlines the first night
of Fancy Dress activities at the
student activities pavilion next
Thursday night. Yes, B.B. King

tion boss to buy his first guitar.

During the past five years the
Waller Family and their band

performances in Santo Domingo
and Canada. Each year they per-
form more than 150 one-nighters

though, B.B. King’s path has
brought him to sleepy Lexington
for a night of blues, a night of
history and a night of enchant-

For those of you spending
your Fancy Dress evening in
Doremus gymnasium at the rock
side of the ball, you are in for a
treat and for a very unique even-
ing of music. After The Reivers
finish their set a four-man band
from Seattle called The Young
Fresh Fellows will take the
stage. What they will do with it,
we have no idea. We do know,
however, that The Fellows are
fun and they’re hot. Perhaps
their press release can best ex-

band.

‘*The name YOUNG FRESH
FELLOWS, was derived from
the idiomatic French axiom
‘einer Sache Wurze verliehen’
[Though we at the Phi argue that
this is German, the press release
argues otherwise], which loosely
translated means: ‘to add zest to
something.’ It is this very zest
for the musical profession that
has resulted in critical raves and
unparalleled financial rewards
for the four precocious lads from
Seattle.’’

But when Chuck Carroll, Tad
Hutchinson and Scott Mc-
Caughey (pronounce it ‘McCoy’
OR ELSE) completed work on

the debut YFF Ip, The Fabulous
Sounds of the Pacific Northwest,
they had little faith in such a
future. Though they recognized
the record as being imbued with
genius, it was beyond their
oracular scope to conceive of
anyone actually buying the damn
thing. One could cite the
disastrous commercial showings
of many similarly spectacular ar-
tistic endeavors: Song Cycle by
Van Dyke Parks, Neil Young’s
Tonight’s the Night, The Beach
Boys Love You, The Second
Album by Richard Peterson, etc.
But as history has already foot-
noted, Fab Sounds became an
overnight success and catapulted

ding universe.”’

“Bassist extraordinaire, Zoot
Sandstone, joined shortly
thereafter to allow McCaughey a
greater degree of irresponsibility
in the group’s extravagant ‘live’
presentation. Having studied
Julliard with Pastorius, Zoot’s
technical training was im-
mediately put to use on the sec-
ond YFF Ip, Topsy Turvy,
released at the end of 1985. Ac-
claimed at the time by publica-
tions from Rolling Stone to
Forced Exposure, Turvy has
since become a fixture on many
prominent lists of the Top Ten
Rock Albums of All-Time. As
Tom Waits stated in a discussion
of the record during a Downbeat
interview, ‘That is one mess ‘o

rious Squirrels project Ernest

on Popliama/Frontier) and the
San Francisco Giants collapse in

“Totally Lost, the fourth LP
that presumably you are listen-

proclaim Totally Lost to be yet
another superlative waxing,
chockful of nourishing

and the crazed bashing that fans
have come to enjoy as the trend-

pact disc later this year.

The non-stop Lanin Orchestra
Center

ready

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

 

The atmosphere of sophistica-
tion and savoir-faire associated
with an evening on the Orient
Express will find musical ex-
pression through the Lester
Lanin Orchestra, which will
provide entertainment in the
Warner Center throughout the
Fancy Dress ball.

Bringing 1500 of Lanin’s
trademark beanies for distribu-
tion to dancers and spectators,
the 15-piece orchestra with two
vocalists will play continuously
from 9 p.m. to | a.m.

This will be at least the second
time that the Lester Lanin Or-
chestra has performed at W&L;
the band appeared at the Dia-
mond Jubilee Fancy Dress Ball
in 1982.

Ballgoers can expect non-stop
music—Lanin orchestras _ play
without breaks, and are as likely
to play songs by Billy Joel or the
Beatles as Gershwin, Cole
Porter or Jerome Kern. Typical
big band favorites such as *‘In
the Mood’’ or *‘Just in Time”
will also be heard.

Lanin and his orchestras have
performed tor most of the
“Beautiful Peopie’’ of _ this
world—for ten presidential in-
augural bails, including George
Bush's at the Omni Shoreham
Hotel in Washington; at the
weddings of Charles and Diana
and Andrew and Sarah, Billy
Joel and Christie Brinkley. and

countless others; for debutante
balls and college dances and
even Malcolm Forbes’s parties.
The man calls his clients, not by
their first names, but by the

last—Mr. Rockefeller, Mr.
Marriot, Mr. Zappa (as in
Frank), Mr. Perot, Mr. (or

Mrs.) Trump, or Baroness de
Rothschild, and many others.

He has even made an ap-
pearance in the movies—as
himself, in a Cybill Shepherd-
Ryan O'Neil project filmed in
Washington and Los Angeles.

The tradition of the beanies
began by accident, Lanin told
The New York Times, after he
saw a man selling them on
Broadway and decided they were
a good idea. He now gives away
about 50,000 of the multicolored
cotton hats annually; High
Society partygoers are known to
remember particular events
because of particular hats.

The Lanin family name has
been associated with good music
since Lester's father, Benjamin,
was a band-leader in Philadel-
phia. Lester learned to play
drums and by age 15 was doing
gigs not only with his father, but
also with his own band in Palm
Beach. Six of Lester's eight
older brothers also headed bands
of their own.

Since then, Lanin has spent
three or four nights a week per-
forming, without a week off
since 1945. He was once mar-
ried to a former Miss Texas, but
told The New York Times that the
marriage fell apart because ‘‘she

spent more time on the road than
I did.”

Lanin’s business is more than
just leading one band on the
road. On any Saturday night, he
sends ten or fifteen orchestras
out with his name. In an inter-
view with People magazine,
Lanin said the musicians are
primarily older men.

“It's hard to find young
players who can do this,”’ he
told the magazine. ‘*You’ve got
to know three or four hundred
tunes just for openers. The kids
today, well, they learned another
way. They can read music like
nobody’s business. They can
read flyspecks. But we don’t use
music, so what good is that? You
gotta have the stuff in your
head.”’

By Lanin’s own count, he
employs 200 to 300 musicians,
and his organization mails at
least 1000 federal tax W-2 forms
each year. Unfortunately, ac-
cording to Fancy Dress Chair-
man Liz Smith, Lanin himself
will not appear at W&L—he was
already committed to directing at
a performance in Chicago on the
same night.

Letitia Baldridge, the social
secretary for Jackie Kennedy,
told People magazine, ‘‘Lester
Lanin has been, for so many of
us for so long, the one stable,
predictable guarantee of success
at any social gathering, be it a
debut in Newport or a state
dinner at the White House. ”’

wine was especially chosen to
best epitomize the elegance of
the ball and of the Orient Ex-
press itself. After ‘‘popping‘‘
the cork and filling the flutes, the
aromatic bouquet is immediately
enjoyed by the taster. The taster
carefully examines the color and
recognizes the clarity of the
candlelight through the nectar.
Gently rotating the glass to ex-
amine the texture, one notices
the legs streaming down the
glass signifying excellence.
After the first sip, you will im-
mediately recognize a fine blend
of a California Champagne

the award winning Napa Valley
region. Of course it is precisely
chilled to perfection at 42

Take a trip on the most gl

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

The name of the Orient Ex-
press conjures images of
extravagance, intrigue,
romance, mystery, even a touch
of foul play. It has inspired such
authors as Agatha Christie,
Graham Greene and D.H.
Lawrence, and been the scene or
subject of at least five films, six
novels, and several stage presen-
tations. Think back to a time
when the moneyed classes had
only to dine, rest, and gaze out
the train windows at the spec-
tacular scenery passing by; to a
time when dressing for dinner
was the custom and afternoon tea
was an event. From the royalty
and celebrities who boarded it,
to the magnificence of the train
itself, the Orient Express
presents a sophisticated, elegant
theme for the 82nd Fancy Dress
Ball.

—z=—

The idea of a European ex-
press through train service was
the brainchild of Georges
Nagelmackers, a Frenchman of
a well-to-do family who
emigrated to New York after be-
ing spurned by an older women
he loved. At the time of his ar-
rival, the Pullman Delmonico
dining-car was unveiled, which
inspired Nagelmackers to con-
sider the business of passenger
travel. Upon his return to
Europe in 1868, Nagelmackers
developed a service of coaches
to run on existing tracks in
several countries, being pulled
by the engines of the railways
that owned those tracks. The
Orient Express was the first of
his international trains.

Nagelmackers’ family had
been involved in railway financ-
ing in Belgium; he presented that
country’s King Leopold II with

re

 

the proposal for a luxury train,
resulting in the king’s financial
and personal support. The
monarch’s influence among the
rulers of Europe improved
Nagelmackers’ chances of con-
vincing unwilling or skeptical
countries to participate in the
express train venture.

The first journey of the Orient
Express began at Paris’s Gare de
Strasbourg on Oct. 4, 1883, car-
rying 40 passengers bound for
Romania. Included among the
passengers were several of
Nagelmackers’s financial
backers, government officials
from France and Belgium, and
many noted journalists, some of
whom nicknamed the train ‘The
Magic Carpet to the Orient.”’

The train was, at its inaugural,
the most elegant and comfortable
means of train travel from Paris
to Istanbul. Nagelmackers envi-
sioned on a grand scale—his
train was to include every con-
ceivable facility and some not so
easily conceived. There was a
smoking room, a ladies’ boudoir
and a library. Each compartment
was a miniature drawing room
with Turkish carpets, inlaid
tables and two red plush arm-
chairs apiece, with special sleep-
ing compartments which folded
down from the  silk-covered
walls. The shower cubicles in-
cluded mosaic floors and hot and
cold running water.

Nagelmackers was particular-
ly lavish with the dining car, the
ceiling of which was covered
with embossed Spanish leather.
Tapestries hung on the walls and
Genoa velvet curtains were in
each window. Patrons found the
tables set with Baccarat crystal,
and waiters went about their
work wearing powdered wigs,
tailcoats, breeches and _ silk
stockings.

Initially, dinner was a five-

course offering cooked entirely
on board, from fresh foods
stored in a special storage cars
complete with ice-boxes. The
menu included ‘‘lobsters,
oysters, caviar, fish, game and
rich desserts,’’ according to
famed novelist Edmond About, a
passenger aboard the first trip.

 

 

 

 

About also noted that the cars
rode so smoothly that ‘‘not a
drop of champagne and wines
was spilled, and the passengers
reclined in their fauteuils as if
they were in a building firmly
rooted to the ground.”’

The term ‘‘Orient Express”’
actually came to refer to at least
three different routes, all of
which included Paris. The
original Orient Express traveled
to Constantinople by way of
Strasbourg, Stuttgart. Munich,
Linz, Vienna, Budapest,
Bucharest, and Varna, with a sea
connection to Constantinople.
Later, after 1895, the sea
journey connected at Constanta,
not Varna.

The Arlberg Orient Express
included Zurich, Innsbruck,
Salzburg (where it began to
parallel the route to Constan-
tinople), Linz, Vienna,
Budapest, Oradea, and
Bucharest, the end of the line.

The Ostend Orient Express,
with connections to central and
eastern Europe, passed through
Brussels, Frankfurt, Nurnberg

and Prague with the end of the
line being in Warsaw

The major change in routes
occurred a year afte
Nagelmackers’ death in 1905.

cars, No. 2419, was the scene of
the German surrender in 1918
and was retired from active ser-
vice.

The grandest period in Orient
Express history was the time be-
tween the wars. No longer did
passenger lists include only
royalty, nobility, and business
magnates, but now the noted
performers of Europe (singers,
actors and actresses, and con-
ductors), smugglers, spies,
writers, even Houdini and
Ziegfield Follies girls were
treated to the service of the
Orient Express. (Please see ac-
companying story On passengers
of the line on page 26.)

With the outbreak of Wo.
War II, more spying and es-
pionage took place on and
around the train. During the
war, the Simplon route was cur-
tailed, but the Germans con-
tinued a sort of train service
through Germany and eastward.
After the French defeat in 1940,
Hitler had Car 2419 hauled to
the precise spot of the German
surrender 22 years previ
receive the French surrender.

The train continued operations
after the close of the war,
although with the lowering of the
tron Curtai:
more difficult in some respects

was made

 

 

Passports and baggage were ex-
amined thoroughly at borders,
including the relatively open
ones of France and Switzerland.

The demise of the Orient Ex-
press began as early as 1961,
when French railway officials
announced that the final run
would take place May 27. In-

ad

stead, the company continued
service; although the majority of
passengers left at Vienna, the
train ran to Bucharest. Improved
relations .with the Balkan coun-
tries resulted in resumed service
to Athens and Istanbul.

Unfortunately, by the mid-
1970’s the train’s service
reflected but a shadow of its
former grandeur. The final run
of the original Orient Express
left Paris at thirteen minutes
after midnight on May 20, 1977,
with only 18 passengers in sleep-
ing berths; the remaining
travelers took seats in the three-
day coaches taking food and
drink for the journey—no meals
were provided on the train.

The Orient Express arrived at
Serketchi Station in Istanbul on
May 22, 1977, five hours and 38
minutes behind schedule. Its
long tradition of opulent
European train travel was over.

ae

In 1977, an auction of coaches
from the original Orient Express
was held in Monte Carlo. There
were three serious bidders, in-
cluding James B. Sherwood, the
American president of the Lon-
don-based Sea Containers
Group, or SeaCo. Sherwood
purchased two of the cars, to
start a collection of 35 Pullmans
and Wagons-Lits, and had them
extensively restored to their
period opulence by expert craft-
smen throughout Europe. The
five- year restoration cost a re-
ported $20 million; the projects
included hand-set mosaics on
bathroom floors, lamps of Lali-
que glass and mahogany toilet
seats.

The reborn Venice-Simplon
Orient Express started its first
trip on May 25, 1982, nearly
100 years after the first Orient
Express pulled out of Paris’s

Gare de Strasbourg. The 17-car
train of the 1980's journey
traveled from Paris to Venice.

Among the train’s cars are
three restaurant cars, one bar
car, two crew cars, and 11
wagons-lits. Together, they
make up the longest passenger:
train in all Europe (400 meters).

In the company’s first eight
months of service, more than
20,000 passengers embarked for
points east. The train’s capacity
for each of its twice-weekly
departures is 194 travelers; it
needs a 70 percent capacity to
turn a profit. Fares for 1989
range from a low of $245 for a
day car from Zurich to Inn-
sbruck or Innsbruck to Venice,
to a high of $1300 for a south-
bound trip, London to Venice, in
the peak season. The full-length
trip takes about 30 hours, in-
cluding one overnight stay.

This version of the Orient Ex-
press continues the fine stan-
€Gf0s set By the
original—exquisite furnishings,
delectable dining, impeccable
service and a bar that doesn’t
close until the last patron calls it
a night. There are a few com-
plaints—the incessant rocking of
the coaches, the three- hour
dinners (how else to enjoy a
multi-course meal?), the place-
ment of only one bathroom per
carriage.

One American passenger
summed up the difficulties suc-
cinctly: *‘You take the Orient
Express to go back in time, and
that inevitably leads to some in-
conveniences."

Sherwood, the man whose
dream resurrected the Venice-
Simplon Orient Express, puts it
another way: “‘To board this
train,’ he says, ‘‘should be an
event. We're not selling
transportation. ””

Live Drive, an organization
which provides rides to and from
W&L functions, will be pro-
viding its services for the Fancy
Dress weekend.

Live Drive was first conceived
in the spring of 1988. Sopho-
more class EC representative
John Fialcowitz was instrumen-
tal in its founding as well as
sophomores Chris Bray and
Rodd Maloy and senior Benny
Savage. Live Drive was begun
partly because of the large
number of drinking and driving
incidences among W&L
students. The members of Live
Drive worked to establish a safe
ride program for the university.

The first major function that

Live Drive was active in was
Homecoming. Since then, Live
Drive has been available at
Christmas weekend, the Con-
nells concert and various frater-
nity parties. Live Drive has been
very active and successful. Ac-
cording to Fialcowitz, ‘‘this year
has been a good year. The Ad-

ministration and the student
body have really responded
well.’’

For Fancy Dress weekend,
Live Drive will be providing
rides on Thursday night and on
Saturday night. The possibility
of having the vans available for
the ball on Friday night was con-
sidered. However, due to the
fact that the ball is held in close
proximity to the dorms and
fraternity houses, the officers of
Live Drive decided that van ser-

Instead, Live Drive is
‘‘emphasizing not to drink and

chairman Amy Sapp. Fialcowitz
also stressed that Live Drive is
**hoping people can walk to and

Live Drive will be providing
rides to and from Thursday
night’s concert and the vans will
be running up to the pavilion.
There will also be stops at the
Baker-Davis-Gilliam quad and at
all of the fraternity houses.

For Saturday's fraternity par-
ties, Live Drive is providing
rides on a request basis accor-
ding to Fialcowitz. Each frater-
nity will make a request to Live
Drive if they wish to have the
vans available for their parties
and according to Fialcowitz
there is no set route for Saturday
night.

Live Drive is in the process of
establishing a call-in service in
which a student could call a cer-
tain number and a member of
Live Drive would pick up that
student and give him a ride
home. Fialcowitz said that this
service should be implemented
this year.

Fialcowitz expressed an em-
phasis on ‘‘preventive
measures’ for the entire week-
end. The members of Live Drive
encourage students to walk to
and from Fancy Dress functions
and expressed that if driving is
necessary during the weekend,
students should be sure to
designate a sober driver.

The Reivers bring new sound to Doremus

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Friday night is the big night.
The Warner Center will be dec
orated from top to bottom with
Lester Lanin providing the big
band swing to make everyones
toes tap and feet dance. But how
about those that don’t enjoy big
band music or those who just
want to be-bop back and forth
between big band and _ rock.
Don’t worry, you're not
forgotten.

Starting sometime after 9 p.m.
the intellectual rock and roll
band The Reivers will start off
the rock side of the ball with the
Young Fresh Fellows following.
Sounding a little like a cross be-
tween The Outfield and 10,000
Maniacs, The Reivers combine
poetically pleasant lyrics with a
biting musical score that com-
bines for a fulfilling experience.
Intellectual, though? Perhaps
lead guitarist, singer and pro-
ducer John Croslin can best ex-
plain.

‘*We've been fairly well
received critically, but some
critics have pointed out that
we're a little bit intellectual. I'm
a real fan of William Faulkner,
[the band took its name from the
Faulkner novel of the same
name] and yes, that’s one for
needing Cliff Notes; but I want
people to understand and be
touched by the music without
knowing about Shakespeare or

consulting Cliff Notes, and |
think a lot of people
misunderstood that. Rock ‘n’
roll is considered emotional, not
intellectual, I enjoy bringing the
two together.”

The Reivers origin begins with
a band called Zeitgeist that the
four members of the band,
Croslin, singer and rhythm
guitarist Kim Longacre, bassist
Cindy Toth and drummer Gar-
rett Williams, formed at the
University of Texas between
1983 and 1985. A few months
later Zeitgeist put together a 3-
song EP that won great response
from the local crowds as well as
critical raves nationally.

In 1986, DB Records based in
Atlanta signed Zeitgeist and
released Translate Slowly which
Croslin produced. About this
time, however, a New Age band
from Minnesota, also called
Zeitgeist forced the band to
change its name and thus, The
Reivers were born.

Later in 1986 The Reivers
signed a contract with Capitol
records and relea Saturday in
late 1987, Then in March of
1988, the band was named Best
New Music Band for the fourth
year in a row by the Austin
Chronicle and was named Band
of the Year. The Reivers come
to W&L having released their
third album End of the Day just
over a month ago.

The Reivers will bring their fresh sound to Doremus Friday night.

The Reivers are coming on in
the music world and don’t let
anyone tell you differently.
Longacre attributes it to the be-
ing in the right place at the right
time and a lot of hard work.

““We formed at a unique time
in the Austin music scene. No
one was expecting any record
deals or any real attention to be
paid to us. We formed a band —
and played a lot of parties. Then
we wondered if we could get a
show. We got shows, and that

was cool, and then we said,
‘Let’s make a single...if there’s
one thing we want to take away
from this band it’s a single.” So
we made a single. Then we said,
*Wouldn’t it be a hoot if we went
on tour.’ It kind of snowballed.
When we ran into Danny Beard,
who owned DB Records, he lik-
ed us and signed us.”’

As good and bad as life has
been for the Reivers so far,
however, they know they have a
long, but promising road ahead

of them.

**{It hasn’t been] a struggle; it

Twenty Questions and Answers with |
Fancy Dress Chairman Liz Smith

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

1. How did you get to the
Chairman of Fancy Dress?

After being the assistant
chairman for last year’s ball, I
applied for this year’s chairman
position. I was interviewed by
the Executive Committee who
selects all of the members of the
SAB Board of Directors, and
was chosen at the beginning of
Spring Term last year.

2.What are your actual
responsibilities as Fancy Dress
Chairman?

As a member of the SAB
Board of Directors I work to
help provide entertainment and
activities for the student body.
My major responsibility, of
course, is the organization of the
Friday Ball including managing
the budget, ordering supplies
and decorations and  coor-
dinating the work schedule.
Many people play major roles in
the whole process, but I guess
I’m the one that cracks the whip
to make sure it all gets done.

3. How much money is being
spent on this year’s ball?

The cost of this year’s ball
comes close to $100,000 in-
cluding Thursday night enter-
tainment. My budget for the ball
alone is around $85,000.

into this year’s ball?

The SAB members-at-large
and the Fancy Dress Steering
Committee each work 20 hours.
Specific committee chairmen
will work more than that along
with the board members. In all,
we have around 100 people actu-
ally doing the hands-on prep-
aration.

5. How difficult was it to get
the bands hired for Fancy
Dress?

Every year there are problems
with hiring bands for Fancy
Dress. This happens because the
beginning of March is a time that
is not normally used for touring
by big-name acts. They usually
wait until April to start the
spring tour schedule. This being
the case, you have to offer ex-
treme prices to bring the bands
out and most of the time, they
use the winter months to cut new
albums or ‘‘rest’’ and won’t
come out for an isolated date.
It’s very frustrating when you
have the money to spend and
acts won't accept offers.

6. Why won’t they accept
offers?

I guess they view W&L as a
small audience and one that
won't help them much as far as
record sales or other promotions
go. They feel it’s not worth their
while to come to a closed private
event like Fancy Dress for the
same price they could get at a
bigger school or another con-
cert.

7. Was it especially hard to
get Lester Lanin?

No. Lester Lanin approached
me to book the Fancy Dress date
back in October. He loves to
play at W&L and we were lucky
enough to book his orchestra for
Friday. He can’t come himself
because of a prior engagement.
(Lester Lanin has around 15 or-
chestras that he dispatched to
different events.) He stays busy
most of the year and travels ex-
tensively.

8. What will be different
about this year’s ball?

This year we have incor-
porated more direct impact from
committee members. There are

16 committee chairmen who
have worked very hard to de-
velop the details of the Ball dec-
orations and assumed leadership
positions in the production. The
Ball will have a _ very
sophisticated and glitzy am-
biance that should make for a
very special evening.

9. How did you come up with
the theme?

Suggestions were tossed
around among the board and
members and then a final list was
compiled and voted on. The two
vote getters were ‘‘Orient Ex-
press’ and ‘‘Roaring 20s’’ cap-
turing 57 percent of the vote. We
decided that since the heyday of
the Orient Express was in the
20s, the two themes could be
easily incorporated to create this
year’s theme.

10. Who came up with the
decoration ideas?

The overall concepts were de-
veloped by my assistant, Tim
Ward, and myself with the aid of
literature from the actual Orient
Express network. Then the
committee chairmen took those
basic guidelines and worked out
the specific details and sketches.

11. Where does the money
for the ball come from?

Fancy Dress is its own busi-
ness. What we spend we have to
get back in ticket and
memorabilia sales. It takes a
tremendous amount of careful
budgeting to make sure the
numbers work out the way they
should so that Fancy Dress pays
for itself.

12. What is the most exciting
thing about this year’s ball?

We have a 40 by 10 foot rep-
lica of the Bar-Salon Car of the
actual Orient Express train that
we have acquired and shipped
here to Lexington to be the focal
point of the 500 level balcony.

13. How did you find out
about the Bar-Salon Car?

Tim Ward knew about it from
a benefit ball that used the Orient
Express theme in Tampa,
Florida. He coordinated our
purchase of it and facilitated its
arrival here at the ball.

Fancy Dress chairman Liz Smith answers 20 Fancy Dress questions.

preliminary organization since
September. The theme was
finalized before Christmas and
all of the specific planning began
in January. The Ball takes about
six to eight months to plan and
organize.

16. Will we be having a
fireworks display this year?

Yes, we will again have a
large fireworks show to close the
ball at around | a.m.. We will
also have two searchlights which
we’ve brought back for this year
due to student request.

17. Where will everything be
located at the ball?

We have basically stuck to the
same layout that we have had in
the past. Lester Lanin will play
in the Warner Center and the
Reivers and Young Fresh
Fellows will play in Doremus.

18. What’s been the hardest
thing about managing Fancy
Dress?

Definitely coordinating all of
the people with the jobs that
need to be done. Because of the
extensive construction this year,
it has been difficult to plan
building in pieces since we can’t
move into the gym until Tuesday
evening.

19. What is the alcohol pol-
icy this year?

There will be no beer garden
this year. Getting an ABC
license is very difficult for any
W&L function and we decided
that it would be better to not
have a license and therefore not
have ABC agents at the ball than
have a license and agents there
to arrest underage drinkers. It
just isn’t worth the hassle. I have
no doubt that everyone will en-
Joy themselves with or without
beer.

20. What’s the one thing you
want the W&L community to
know about this year’s Fancy
Dress Ball?

Fancy Dress is a long-standing
tradition which a large portion of
the university takes part in.
Many people in every area of
our campus have had a hand in
the final product you will be a
part of on Friday evening.

Take the time to read the
background information on the
theme and the era which will
make all that you see more
meaningful. Fancy Dress is for
you to enjoy- those who have
worked have done so to make
your weekend one that you will
remember. Please take the time
to thank your friends for their
efforts. I wish there was space
for me to express my apprecia-
tion to all who made Tim’s and
my endeavor achievable. I'll
delegate that job to you. Enjoy
your weekend.

The graphic artist responsible
for this year’s Fancy Dress T-
shirts, cups and other souvenirs
is a 1980 W&L alumnus, Bruce
Whipple.

After majoring in European
history and economics at W&L,
Whipple continued his education
at North Carolina State,
graduating in 1986 with a
master’s degree in product

design and a graphic design op-
tion.

He is currently the marketing
and business development
manager for Hanbury Evans
Newill Vlattas & Company of

Whipple also worked for two
years as marketing director for
Marcellus Wright Cox and
Smith Architects of Richmond.
That company designed the
W&L University Library, Lewis

Your culinary guide to FD

By Jason Faust
Alumni Staff Reporter

 

Fancy Dress, one of the
nation’s largest parties, a time
for great bands and people, is
also the right time to go out and
enjoy a good meal with a date.
or, for those who dare venture to
Fancy Dress without a date,
good friends.

Towards this end, the
southwest region of Virginia can
more than adequately cater to
such dining needs. Tucked away
in Charlottesville, Staunton,
Lexington, Lynchburg and
Roanoke: are some great dining
establishments.

In this article I have tried to
put together a list of some of
these places with a brief descrip-
tion and essential details for
each. I can not claim to have
eaten at all the restaurants listed,
but they all have good reputa-
tions or have otherwise been
recommended to me. In most
cases, a Call to the maitre d’ was
necessary.

At this point, I must admit that
after re-reading the descriptions,
this may not be a fair article. The
descriptions may appear that I
am trying to head you to a par-
ticular restaurant.

I must admit also that I do
have a personal favorite, The
White Star Mill, but please don’t
let the sound or size of a descrip-
tion discourage you— I don’t
think you can go wrong with any
of them.

In any case, whether you
choose a restaurant from this or
dine at your own favorite, eat
well and with a group of friends
for ‘‘good dining company
makes for better dining’’—
wherever. And please, don’t
ruin the weekend for your family

and friends by overindulging and
driving. Obey the rules of the
road and use common sense. I
hope this list proves helpful in
making your Fancy Dress
Weekend successful.

BON APPETIT.

Charlottesville

The Boar’s Head Inn, Route
250 W., 2 miles off Route 29,
804-276-2131.

Located in a posh region of
Albemarle County, the Boar's
Head Inn serves as both an inn
and a restaurant. Though the
menu lacks international flare
they do serve duck. The glory of
the Boar’s Inn is solid American
cuisine prepared impeccably.
Prices of entrees range from
$12.25 to $18. A full bar with a
good selection of wines will ac-
company a meal nicely. Reserva-
tions and jackets for men are re-
quired.

The Ivy Inn, 2244 Old Ivy
Road (across from Ivy gardens

— one mile from University of

Virginia), 804-977-1222.

Dine by candlelight in this
restored large house, built circa
1803. The menu at the Ivy Inn
varies greatly, including
chicken, beef, veal and lamb.
Prices range from $10.50 to
$14.00. Despite the romantic
atmosphere, Mrs. Abbot, the
proprietor, permits a ‘‘just be
comfortable’ style of dress, but
she would appreciate reserva-
tions. All spirits are served.

The C&O Restaurant, 515 E.
Water, 804-971-7044.

This may be one of Char-
lottesville’s, and southwest
Virginia’s, most enjoyable and
unique restaurants. At the C&O

Restaurant, the emphasis of the
dining experience is on the food
(‘‘the focus of the senses’’) and
as such the formal dining room
(coat and tie required) is dec-
orated all white —white linens,
white walls, white floors. The
French cuisine is serve a la carte
but unlike European restaurants
the portions are large. Don’t
pass up the opportunity to enjoy
your meal with a bottle of wine
from the C&O’s extensive wine
cellar which has been voted one
of the top 100 in the nation by
Wine Spectator magazine. En-
tree prices range from $18.25 to
$25. Bill Hubert, the manager,
says that the experience is
unique but honestly admits that
you may love it or hate it. There
are two seatings for dinner, the
first at 6:30 and the second at
9:30 p.m..

L

Emil’s, Boonsboro Shopping
Center, Route 501 North, 804-
384-3311.

Don’t let Emil’s location fool
you or deter you— this place is
wonderful— probably as many
Sweet Briar girls can attest.
Emil’s serves lunch and dinner
in its two dining rooms. The
menu is varied and enticing. Li-
quor, beer and wine are served.
Dinner prices of entrees start at
around $8, the average being
about $12. Dress for dinner is
semi-formal to formal and reser-
vations are recommended.

Sachiko’s International Res-
taurant, 126 Old Grave Mill
Road, 804-237-5655.

Beef, seafood, veal, lamb and
chicken dishes all prepared in a

great variety of international
styles will certainly satisfy a
number of different tastes.
Prices range from $9.50 to
$21.95 and a full complement of
spirits will help carry the even-
ing. Sachiko’s is an elegant res-
taurant and requires coat and tie
as well as reservations.

The Bank, 1030 Main St. (11th
and Main), 804-847-8100.

The structural beauty of ine
Bank will enhance a meal of
authentic French cuisine.
Originally built in 1914 as a
bank, the owner of the restaurant
has since spent over one million
dollars converting the building
into a three-story restaurant. The
third floor serves as a formal
dining room complete with
fireplace and 40-foot ceilings ac-
centuated with decorative gold
leaf. Meals are made-to-order
and the menu may vary
somewhat according to
deliveries made four times week-
ly. Prices are very reasonable
starting at $8.50. The owner and
chef assure that you will never
feel out of place in black tie for
many patrons are fully decked
out. Though reservations are
suggested a week in advance, it
would behoove you to call

anyway.

Roanoke

The Library, 3117 Franklin
Road {in Piccadilly Square),
985-0811

The Library is a beautiful,
quaint French restaurant with
more than excellent atmosphere.
The service is perfect as is the
extensive menu complete with

seafood, beef, lamb and veal
dishes that will delight the palate
of even the pickiest eaters. If you
can stand it, leave room for the
dessert cart which will both
amaze and delight. Entrees will
run anywhere from $17.95 to
$21.95. The Library is possibly
the finest restaurant in Roanoke,
and definitely one of the finest in
the state a la Virginia: A History
and Guide.

La Maison,
Road, 366-2444.

The elegance of La Maison is
evident even before you enter
the front door. Once a Georgian
mansion, the beautiful structure
now contains 15 dining rooms in
which delicious French cuisine
is served. French veal and lamb
are generally the order of the day
but American fare of beef and
seafood are also served. Entrees
run generally between $7 and
$18 with $11 as the average.
Dress is optional but a coat and
tie are recommended. Dinner is
served Monday through Satur-
day from 4:30 to 11:00 p.m..
Reservations are recommended
when dining on Saturday.

5732 Airport

Fesquet Upper level—
Crossroads Mall, 362-8803.

Fesquet is a casual restaurant
located just 10 minutes from
Hollins College. In a cozy at-
mosphere you can dine on
French cuisine or seafood.

meal complete. Prices start at
$12.95.

Ln

Lexington

The Wilson-Walker House, 30
N. Main St. , 463-3020.

The Wilso.-Walker House is
similar to old inn dining. There
are several rooms which add to
its coziness and eliminates much
of the hustle and bustle of large
one-room restaurants. Cocktails,
beer and wine will complement
your meal. The menu is strong
with beef, seafood and chicken
dishes. Entrees are prepared a
variety of different ways, in-
cluding Southern American. The
location is a plus and conve-
nience in choosing the restaurant
for it is walking distance from
most parts of town. Prices range
from around $8 to about $15.
Reservations are a must during
Fancy Dress and coat and tie are
recommended.

Maple Hall, Route 11 and 81,
Lexington, 463- 4666.
Maple Hall is a beautiful large

country home converted into a
restaurant. There are several
small dining rooms decorated in
impeccable colonial taste. Maple
Hall does have a private room
reserved for larger parties. The
menu will vary from day to day
but a patron can always count on
high quality service and fine
country dining. Again the con-
venience of dining in the Lex-
ington area is obvious. Reserva-
tions are appreciated and coat
and tie is recommended.

Hunan Garden, East Nelson
Street, Lexington. 463-3330.

This, Lexington’s only
Chinese restaurant (and the only
Oriental restaurant since the
demise three years ago of the
legendary Aloha Wok) opened in
April last year. Students have
varying opinions of the estab-
lishment—some think it offers
respectable Chinese cuisine (par-

ticularly taking into account the
fact that it is located in the heart
of the Shenandoah Valley),
while others have been
dissatisfied with the service
and/or food. Chances are you’ ve
got your own opinion already.

Staunton

Buckhorn Inn, 12 miles west of
Staunton, Route 250 W.
Churchville, 337-6900.

The Buckhorn Inn is a very
casual restaurant serving an
$11.50 seafood buffet on Friday.
Enjoy beer, wine and a lot to eat
between the hours of 4:00 and
9:00. Reservations are not
necessary but you may want to
call ahead to be sure.

The White Star Mill, 1 Mill
St., 885-3409.

Truly one of the finer estab-
lishments around. The White
Star Mill is not cheap but is

Fancy Dress Supplement, February 23, 1989, Page 23

definitely worth it for the
tremendous variety of dishes.
Appetizers range from escargot
to a variety of soups. Desserts
are a la carte and plentiful but
the entrees are the bill of the
day. Pasta, beef, all types of
seafood, and Cajun dishes are
prepared to impeccable detail
and taste. An evening at the
White Star Mill for two, in-
cluding a few indulgences into
the full bar, will run around $80
to $100 but, oh boy, it’s well
worth the expense if you can af-
ford it.

The Belle Grae Inn, 515 W.
Frederick St. (Downtown), 886-
5151.

The Bell Grae Inn has a bistro
serving an a la carte menu and a
dining room located in the old
inn. Dinner varies from night to
night according to the chef's
choices. Each night there is a
choice of three different meals
which include appetizer, soup,

entree and dessert for the set
price of $20. A full bar will add
an additional price per drink.
Dress is optional and reserva-
tions are not required though it
may be well advised to call
ahead to check on the crowd and
menu.

(Note: This article was original-
ly printed in last year’s Fancy
Dress Supplement. Prices may
have changed since that time and
those interested in eating at any
of these establishments are urged
to call and check current prices.)

On FD,

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Many of you might be wonder-
ing what the sports editor of this
highly respectable newspaper is
doing talking (commenting,
analyzing?) on Fancy ‘‘I have
absolutely nothing to do with
sweat socks and Nike hightops’’
Dress. It’s not that I’m the staff
social critic or anything for The
Phi. So why me? What qualifica-
tions could I possibly have?
Well, none. But that didn’t stop
Dan Quayle from running for
Vice President and look what
happened to him. Anyway,
sports are entertainment and FD
is certainly entertaining in some
peculiar sort of way, so that
justifies the sports writer in giv-
ing a new perspective on this
major social event of the school
year. Okay, I’m stretching a bit,
but hey, somebody has got to
make some sense out of it all
(and Mr. Tuggle wouldn’t give
me the Senior Perspective posi-
tion).

I liken the FD experience to a
game I played when I was young
— flashlight tag. It was sort of
the nighttime version of hide and
seek but the boundaries were
more confined and you had that
big 10-volt Radio Shack

 

flashlights and playing games

spotlight that, if you weren’t
careful, would blind the dog or
burn a hole in somebody’s pants
pockets. The object was for your
friends to hide in trees, under
cars or behind bushes and the
person who was “‘it’’ would
‘‘catch’’ you using the
flashlight. The problem was
never one of location but of iden-
tification. We used to change
clothes —T-shirts, shorts and
sneakers — to make it even more
of a challenge. Appearance and
reality diverged. What you
thought you. saw and what was
actually true did not always
coincide. Great game, huh?

Well, FD is a lot like
flashlight tag. The person in
need of a date is ‘‘it.’’ The
“‘game’’ is played at night
(although daytime competition is
allowed. And the players are
constantly changing appearances
(we all know about girls and
their friends when it comes to
borrowing clothes). The idea is
to “‘catch’’ someone; namely,
the perfect date. The only
differences are girls are allowed
to play in this game and every-
one who hasn’t secured a date
yet is ‘‘it.”’ And that is where the
game begins, for who really
doesn’t want to go to FD?

Like most games, there are
winners and losers. But just get-
ting a date does not mean you
have won the game, nor is the
converse true. Winning and los-
ing is not based on finding a
date, but rather on identifying
the good ones from the bad ones.
I think everyone is tired of hear-
ing about the ‘‘perfect’’ date that
ended up in disaster. I have no
sympathy. You blew it by choos-
ing that person in the first place.
To have a good time you have to
be good at the game, and to be
good at the game you must know
the rules. So........

Rule No. 1—Never ever ask a
person while under the influence
of alcohol. Reasons are self-
explanatory. However, entrap-
ment is allowed. So if the
homecoming queen gets a little
tipsy one Friday night, go for it
(and get her to pledge on her
honor — several witnesses
would be key here.

Rule No. 2—If it’s someone
you have just met, play it cheap.
No sense in blowing $200 on a
person that you may or may not
have fun with. If it’s someone
you love.... play it cheap. If
you’re in love you don’t have to
impress her/him. So I guess the

operative word for the weekend
is “‘cheap.”’

Rule No. 3—Don’t ask
anyone the week of FD. Des-
perateness has a way of clouding
your judgment especially when
combined with judgment-
clouding substances (see Rule
No. 1). If you don’t discover
anyone worthy of spending the
weekend with you, don’t worry
(be happy). It’s not like less than
SO percent of the W&L popula-
tion doesn’t have a good time,
anyway.

Rule No. 4—Always find out
a person’s intentions before giv-
ing out the bid. Example: If a
girl asks ‘‘Who is playing at
your house on Saturday night?”’
before you ask her, forget it. If
she says something like ‘White
Star Mills is my favorite restau-
rant,’’ ask her if she wants to go
there for dinner and then tell her
to have a good time. See? And
who said this game couldn’t be
fun?

Rule No. 5—Keep the number
of couples in a group to four or
less. There is nothing worse than
being held up by other people’s
lateness. That is, unless your
best friend’s date happens to take

 

off her dress and start dancing
on the bar at the cocktail party.
But these things only happen on
rare occasions.

And there you have it. Rules
or guidelines that will ensure
you of success in your quest for
the best time at Fancy Dress
(my, that was almost poetic).
And remember, its not the Ball
that brings the most excitement,
but rather the game of FD Tag
that precedes it all. By the way,
has anyone seen my flashlight?

Famous passengers of the Express

 

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

The Orient Express has hosted scores of world-famous people,
including royalty, performers of all kinds, spies and wealthy
business owners. Here is a short listing of some of the more
colorful personalities who have ridden the Orient Express.

Isadore Duncan — The dancer gave ‘‘unconventional’’ per-
formances on board train—including her trips to the shower.
One conductor remembered that she pranced from her com-
partment clad in ‘‘much less than a veil—rather, something in
the size of a handkerchief, and in the wrong place, too.”’

Harry Houdini — Magician and escape artist extraor-
dinaire, Houdini was one of the most frequent passengers and
occasionally gave performances on board.

Arturo Toscanini — Later the conductor of the NBC Or-
chestra, he often traveled with his family. Roger Commault,
an Orient Express staff member, was changing records on the
hand-operated gramophone in one of the restaurant cars when
he saw Toscanini and began searching for a few Verdi and
Bizet opera recordings; the maestro congratulated him on his
musical taste.

King Boris of Bulgaria — The ruler was a railway buff who
insisted on taking the train's controls while traveling through
his own country. Since his will was sovereign within his
borders, the engineer had to allow him; by all accounts, he was
a capable driver.

Mata Hari — ‘*The Most Dangerous Woman Spy’’ escaped
an unhappy marriage to an alcoholic by going to Paris and
becoming a courtesan and the first nude dancer in that city. She
was executed in 1917, partially because of her friendship with
a German diplomat.

Maharajah of Cooch Behar — The ruler of a small land in
northeast India brought his seven wives and concubines and 29
servants on his trip to London for the imperial conference in
1907,

Edward VIII — While still Prince of Wales (before his
reign and abdication), Edward insisted on having a grilled
kipper for breakfast. None were on board (being regarded as a
lower class dish), so the enterprising chef found some smoked
trout, sliced it and grilled it. The prince was completely
satisfied with his meal.

Sidney Poitier — The American actor, the first black man to
win an Academy Award, brought 30 pieces of luggage for his
travel on the restored Venice-Simplon Orient Express.

A special Thanks -

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

The Fancy Dress Ball is a glo-
rious tradition at Washington
and Lee and has been cherished
as ‘‘the best time of the year’’
almost since its inception in
1907. Miss Annie Jo White must
laugh when she looks down and
sees what a big deal her little get-
together has become.

There is an undeniable magic
that accompanies Fancy Dress.
Everyone seems happier and
more “‘laid back’’ to coin a
phrase from my part of the coun-
try. Perhaps it is the anticipation
of having just the right date, or
that entire weekend, day and
night with someone who is really
special. Maybe it’s the prospect
of dropping out of reality for
four days and nights with
nothing to worry about but
eating, drinking, laughing and
enjoying yourself. Whatever the
cause for elation, it is justified
and good.

This year’s Fancy Dress, An
Evening Excursion on the Orient
Express will be the fruit of many
people’s labor and as Liz Smith
points out in her question and
answer article, please take the
time to thank the people who
made this year’s ball possible.
These people have just as much
to do as the rest of us, but for
two weeks they make the

' sacrifices and do the work and

make Fancy Dress, your Fancy
Dress a reality.

As you come to the end of this
year’s special FD supplement, I
hope you have both enjoyed your
reading and gotten something
from it. Like the Ball itself, this
supplement is the fruit of many
people’s labors and a project that
has taken countless hours to put
together. It is all worth it,
however, if you the reader
benefit from our work.

As the Entertainment Editor
for the past two years, I feel the
most worthwhile thing I have
done was putting together the
past two Fancy Dress Sup-
plements. I can only hope that
when I am gone that the tradition
we have started, will continue to
exist.

Before concluding, there are
some people that I would like to
thank for their help in making
this supplement possible.

THANKS:

-to Margaret Pimblett without
whose tireless help and research
this would never have gotten to
press.

-to Betsy Parkins and Pam
Kelley for their help in laying
out the biggest project we have
ever taken on.

_ to Liz Smith for all her help and

cooperation in getting the infor-
mation necessary to put this
together. I can only hope that the

articles in the supplement have
done her enough justice as the
Chairman. She has put together
the best Fancy Dress that cer-
tainly any of us have seen and
should be thanked and appreci-
ated by you all.

-to all the writers who wrote
what are well-written, quality ar-
ticles for the supplement.

-to Beth Freund and Chery! Bar-
rett who stayed up all hours of
the day and night taking and de-
veloping pictures that I needed
for my layout.

-to Gay Lea and Cheryl, the
women in the darkroom and Jim
at the The News Gazette for
their endless help.

-and to you, the Washington and
Lee community, whose interest
inspires us to put out things like
the Fancy Dress supplement.

And finally, though it has been
said over and over again it won't
hurt to say it one more time.
Please don’t drink and drive this
weekend. You know the police
will be out, you know ABC
agents will probably be in the
area since they usually are for
big events like Fancy Dress and
you know what the conse-
quences are for DUI. It’s just not
worth the risk. Please, don’t ruin
your weekend and your life.
Have a safe and a happy Fancy
Dress and enjoy the Supplement.
