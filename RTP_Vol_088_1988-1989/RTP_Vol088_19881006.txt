Debate over the existence of sorori-
ties at Washington and Lee continues
this fall with the creation of a stu-
dent/faculty committee.

According to junior Wendy Wilson,
the committee was formed in response

to a petition circulated at the end of
last winter term.

Over the summer letters were sent
out to all female students asking if
they would be interested in joining the
committee. Dean Atkins, advisor to
the committee, received 64 responses
and of these, 11 were chosen to serve.
Along with the students, five faculty
members (all women) were asked to
participate.

Last weekend marked the 17th an-
nual Class Agents Weekend. The
agents were wined and dined by the
university to honor the those who have
dedicated service to Washington and
Lee.

A Class Agent is an alumni, who
has agreed to solicit donations to the
annual fund from his classmates. His
duties include writing three letters a

“Opinion was not a factor in the
choosing of the students. Whether the
person was for or against sororities
wasn’t known at the time of the de-
cision,”’ said Wilson.

At the inaugural meeting this past
Monday, the committee discussed

panel, including representatives from
Davidson College and Washington

According to Wilson, the informa-

women will be asked if they do or do

not support sororities.

“Our biggest worry is response.

We need to know how people feel. We

have not been given specific numbers,

just to look for ‘significant’ numbers

when making the decision.’’ said
Wilson.

If these ‘significant’ numbers indi-
cate that women are in favor of sorori-
ties, a tentative schedule will be made
up. This includes January Rush for
upperclass women and spring Rush
for freshmen.

On the other hand, if W&L women
overwhelmingly say ‘no’, the commit-
tee will be disbanded and that will be
the end of the question for this year.

graduating class.

The annual fund, according to Car-
ter McNeese, associate director of de-
velopment and director of the Annual
Fund, consists of ‘‘unrestricted gifts
from alumni, parents, and friends of
the university.’’ This fund supports
the daily operating expenses of the
university including faculty salaries,
electricity, telephone bills, etc. The

money can be spent in any manner the
University wishes.

Using an annual fund to subsidize
the budget is not unique to W&L,
however, the university is ‘‘one of
very few schools that uses class agents
almost exclusively to solicit funds for
the Annual Fund,’’ explained
McNeese.

McNeese elaborated further on the
function of the Annual Fund and the
W&L budget. The annual fund sup-

Leading thinker gives

Staff Report

 

Russell Kirk, identified by Time
and Newsweek as ‘‘one of Ameri-
ca’s leading thinkers,’’ will deliver
two lectures at Washington and
Lee University on Tuesday, Oct.
11. The public is invited to attend.

Kirk’s first speech, ‘‘The Gath-
ering of Gentlemen,”’ will be at 3
p.m. in the Moot Courtroom in
Lewis Hall, the W&L law school.
At 7 p.m. Tuesday evening, he will
speak on ‘‘The American Presi-
dency: Hoover Through Reagan’”’
in the Northen Auditorium of the
University Library.

Kirk writes and speaks on politi-
cal thought and practice, edu-
cational theory, literary criticism,
ethical questions and social
themes. The Conservative Mind,
one of his 23 books, is perhaps the
most widely reviewed and discuss-
ed work of political theory in this
century, a W&L_ spokesperson
said. Other books written by Kirk
include The Roots of American Or-
der, a history of ideas and institu-
tions; Decadence and Renewal in
the Higher Learning, biographical
studies of John Randolph of Roan-
oke, Edmund Burke, and Robert
Taft; four volumes of literary

political perspective

social essays; and five volumes of
fiction. He also is the author of
several hundred periodical essays
and short stories. His work has
been published in 20 foreign coun-
tries.

A frequent speaker on American
campuses, Kirk also often appears
on both educational and commer-
cial television and radio. He now is
helping to produce a series of 13
one-hour films based on his book,
The Roots of American Order, to
be shown nationally on public
television stations.

Kirk is the editor of the quarterly
journal University Bookman. He
also was founder and first editor of
the quarterly Modern Age. For 13
years his syndicated column, To
the Point, was distributed by the
Los Angeles Times Syndicate.

Kirk received his bachelor’s de-
gree from Michigan State Univer-
sity and his master’s from Duke
University. Honorary doctorates
have been conferred on Kirk by
Boston College, St. John’s Univer-
sity, Park College, LeMoyne Col-
lege and Loyola College, among
others. He is the only American to
hold the highest earned arts degree

IFC re-evaluates Rush

By Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

Most of Tuesday’s IFC meeting was
devoted to voicing opinions and sug-
gestions for future Rush regulations
by the sixteen fraternity delegates.

“The biggest problem this year,”’
IFC president Ross Singletary said,
‘‘was that there were a lot of grey
areas [in the rules]... lots of things we
hadn’t even thought of came up.”’
Multiple fines were given out this year
by the IFC for Rush violations, most
of which dealt with infringements of
alcohol and no-contact rules.

Also, as Vice President Jeff Kelsey
commented, ‘‘Most freshmen don’t
even know what’s going on before
they sign up[for open houses].’’ The
importance of BYOB parties before
sign-up was stressed, so that rushees
would have a better idea of which
houses they were interested in and in
what manner they wanted to approach
the open house period.

Also, some delegates favored fewer
open houses and more rush dates, with
possible revision of the sign-up situa-
tion. A suggestion was made describ-
ing a system whereby the rushee
would sign up for eight open houses,
the order to be randomly chosen such
that every open house could be treated
with the same vigor as the first few.
The general sentiment was that broth-
ers strongly favor freshmen who come
through toward the beginning of the
open house circuit, depriving the later
ones of the same attention.

Overall, the council agreed that the
present system works quite well, but
that a few revisions for next year’s fall
rush might make things easier and a
bit more fair for all involved

 

get, earnings from the endowments,
gifts from the past that have been in-
vested, equal about 25 percent, and
the rest comes from corporation and
foundation donations.

“It (the Annual Fund) really makes
the difference here of W&L being a
top quality school as opposed to a run-
of-the-mill school. It provides a mar-
gin for excellence,’’ McNeese said.
Furthermore, ‘“W&L has been listed
as a best buy for the past several years
because of the tuition cost compared
to the quality of the education, and
one of the reasons is the Annual
Fund.”’

Last year, class agents set a record
by raising $1,895,784 from 7,129 do-
nors. This year’s goal is $2 million.

Class Agents exist for every class
that has been graduated for 50 years or
more. Out of the 100 class agents and
three officers, 49 attended, coming
from areas such as Houston, Atlanta,
Buffalo and Roanoke.

McNeese estimated that ‘‘about 75
percent of the people who as serving
as class agents have been here in the
past three or four years.’’ Class
Agents usually serve three to five
years. However, this year marked
Charlie Longacre’s (Class of ’33) 20th
year as an Agent. The chairman for
the second year in a row is Hardin
Marion, ’55, ’58 law.

The agents discussed plans for the
coming annual fund year and were
briefed on the state of the university.
On Friday they received dinner in
Evans Dining Hall. They attended a
Saturday morning workshop in the
Moot Courtroom, the football game,
and a Saturday evening cook-out at the
home of Ferris Hotchkiss, vice presi-
dent of university relations.

EC rules on plagiarism policy

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Executive Committee voted at
its Monday meeting to make an “‘in-
formative statement”’ in its plagiarism
guidelines that students operating
under a professor’s directives cannot
be brought up on honor charges.

This action is in response to Journal-
ism Prof. Hampden H. Smith’s
request for clarification of a student’s
position between the Honor System
and his professor. Smith appeared be-
fore the EC last Monday night.

Hugh Finkelstein, vice president of
the EC, said, ‘‘This statement is in-
formative, and is not to be used as a
defense’’ in honor trials.

E.C. Member Dave Nave, who will
word the revision, agreed that this
statement should not be ‘‘codified”’
into the procedural guidelines of the
White Book.

The EC decided not to make the
statement in the White Book. EC
Member Chris Giblin said, ‘‘It
wouldn’t hurt, but I don’t think we
need it.””

In other business, the EC will hold a
public meeting about the CRC and the
EC’s alternate committee proposal in
Lee Chapel. The date is tentatively set
for Oct. 12 at 7 p.m. Finkelstein said
the meeting’s goal is to educate for a
student referendum.

EC Members Dan DuPre, John
Fialcowitz, John McDonough and Al-
ston Parker are currently writing the

Sororities:
yes or no

The 1988-89 school year could prove to be a very important year
for the future of this university and its students. However, the be-
ginning of every school year holds this truth. This year is no

 

different.

Soon the women of this university must make a major decision
about the future of sororities on campus.

Since 1985 when the first coed class enrolled, the women have
been struggling with the question of sororities. Several attempts to
begin some sort of process of establishing sororities have fallen by
the wayside. With each new attempt little progress was made.

Without discussing the merits or demerits of establishing sorori-
ties, it is important to make a decision NOW. Much time has been
wasted counting and recounting and analyzing what the women
want. Time and again the women have been asked ‘*Do you want
sororities?’’ and time and again nothing resulted.

If the women do not want sororities, then so be it. Drop the issue.
If they do want them, then get representatives on campus and start

Rush.

I realize that it takes careful planning to successfully implement a
sorority system but at least make a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision.

Because of the indecision, confusion, and delay that has taken
place since 1985 the women of the senior class may now be ex-
cluded from the process. Even if they are not excluded, they may
well miss out on what they should have had three years ago.

“The Duke’’

 

MY VIEW
By Jim Lake

 

Autumnal musings on the campaign
of Massachusetts’ favorite charlatan,
presidential candidate Michael S. Du-
kakis:

In the tradition of Johnson and Ken-
nedy, it’s Bentsen and Dukakis —
Lloyd and the Duke! Yeah! To par-
aphrase Jesse Jackson, the long night
is over, the morning has come! At
last, an administration like that of JFK
and LBJ — a pair we could count on, a
pair we could trust!

Wait a minute...the Atlanta conven-
tion speakers didn’t quite go that far.
Sure, the idea of repeating the cam-
paign success of Kennedy-Johnson
sounds great to Democrats and has
some appeal to overgrown hippies
with teary-eyed memories of the Ken-
nedy assassination. But somehow the
years in between those two tragic
events don’t make me want to shout,
‘*Kick some ass, Duke!”’

Remember, the team that brought
America a Democratic White House
in 1960 is the same team that brought
us cabinet-level nepotism, sixties in-
flation, the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the
war in Vietnam — hardly high points
in American history.

No, it may be sacrilege for me not
to bow and cross myself when I say
‘*JFK,’’ those hallowed letters of the
American left, but I'll take the chance.
The Austin-Boston connection was
bad for America in 1960, and, as far
as this observer is concerned, the
same is true in 1988.

**Say it ain’t so, Jim! How can you
find even a single reason why we
shouldn’t vote for Massachusetts’ sav-
ior, Lord Michael Stanley?”’

A single item! I’m sorry, but it’s
impossible to pick out just one. So,
with the permission of The Ring-tum
Phi editorial staff, I'll use some space
in this issue to explain why Gov. Du-
kakis has no more business being elec-
ted president than Jimmy Carter, Billy
Carter or Nell Carter.

las Morning Newspointed out not long
after the Democratic Convention,
‘*‘Mr. Dukakis is more than a bore;
he’s a charlatan.’’ The Duke is pre-
tending to be a competent centrist
when he is in fact the opposite — an
incompetent extremist. And the
national media are letting him pull off
this campaign of vague innuendo and
meaningless rhetoric because their
leaders can’t stand the thought of an-
other Republican in the White House.

Let’s put the “‘Gospel according to
Rather’’ to rest. Dukakis did not raise
Massachusetts from the dead and is
not the savior America longingly
waits for. Hard to believe, I know, es-
pecially considering the reports that
have been oozing from the liberal
propaganda machine in_ recent
months, but true nevertheless. And, if
George Bush campaigns as he should
in the few weeks remaining, he can
win by a landslide. Here’s why:

© The Duke on corruption: the gov-
ernor and his friends got together in
Atlanta to pound their chests and cry
with shock and indignation over the
many ‘‘scandals’’ in the Reagan Ad-
ministration.

(Interestingly, the name of Ray-
mond Donovan, the former transpor-
tation secretary who was crucified and
scarred for life by the Democrats be-
fore a grand jury concluded that char-
ges against him should never have
been brought, was not mentioned at
the Atlanta convention. But the name
of former Attorney General Edwin
Meese, whose life was picked apart by
a independent prosecutor but who was
never convicted, indicted or even
charged with anything, was loudly
trumpeted. You see, only Democrats
are presumed innocent until proven
guilty.)

But the Democrats somehow found
it easy to forget that, as Howie Carr of
The Boston Herald points out, their
nominee ‘has presided over the most
corrupt administration in the last 25
years of the already-ripe history of
Massachusetts state government.”

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

My efforts to explain why Ameri-
ca’s children are scoring lower on
standardized tests than many inani-
mate objects like the Ronco Fishing
Rod has brought me to television. It’s
not that children are watching too
much television (about 16 hours a

 

day), it’s the kinds of television shows ,

they’re watching. The problem started
when kids began rejecting classic car-
toons like Bugs Bunny and Friends for
trashy sci-fi metalloid cartoons. Sur-
geon General C. Everett Koop is very
concerned and recently summed up
the problem in an important presi-
dential meeting. Luckily, I happened
to be in the President’s office at this
tim@jof this important disclosure.
President and surgeon general
were playing poker and drinking beer
in the oval office when all of a sudden
things got serious: President: ‘‘Hey,
doc, pass me the peanuts. By the way,
why are children so damn stupid?’
Surgeon General: ‘‘Well, Ron, it’s
T.V.’s fault. A long time ago telev-
ision programmers provided quality
shows for America’s youth. With
heroes like Woody Woodpecker, chil-
dren learned to be clever, violent, he-
donistic, and not to underestimate the
intelligence of animals—the four qua-
lities an American needs to lead a pro-
ductive and wholesome life. But
nowadays television programs for our
youth are dominated by characters
who talk slowly, never have a good
time, and rarely expand energy at-
tempting to carouse with members of

 

 

 

 

 

 

the opposite sex. Individuals with
names like Metalhead and Titanic
Teeth are typical characters in a new
generation cartoon. These inorganic
characters are encouraging our youth
to use drugs like WD-40, talk slowly
and to be generally stupid.’’

To help the Surgeon General in his
effort to save the children I have
formed a Bugs Bunny Fact Finding

Committee. It’s a good head start for
our lost youth.

Bugs Bunny:

disguising himself as a seductive fe-
male

sionally be sympathetic to charac-
ters who are down on their luck.

Chile warms to democracy

 

MY VIEW
By Julia Kirk

In September 1973, atter a bloody
military coup in which the President
of Chile, Salvadore Allende, was
killed, General Augusto Pinochet as-
cended to power. He has been Presi-
dent of Chile ever since. On October
5, Chileans decided if the 73-year- old
dictator would continue to rule their
country. The election was a plebiscite
and Pinochet was the only candidate.
The people voted simply ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

Pinochet is considered one of the
worst human rights violators in the
world. People disappear often in Chile

This is, in effect, an addendum to the Univer-
sity’s parking regulations for 1988-89 and thereaf-

Although I am the duly designated parking Czar
(that is, ticket fixer) for the University, I have
neither the professional training nor the time to
engage in daily quasi-legal debates on whether or
not the University has been explicit enough in
making clear all the places motorists are not sup-
posed to park. Neither is there enough yellow
paint in Lexington to define all these places, nor
does the University wish to create a veritable
forest of No Parking signs. Instead, I resort to this
method of informing all those affected by Univer-
sity regulations as to what is parking rightly and

The map issued to those who register their

and vocal opposition to the regime is
illegal. Seemingly, there is no ques-
tion that Pinochet will lose; however,
before deciding the election out of
hand, one must look at the success of
the Chilean economy.

Chile’s economy under Pinochet is
nothing short of miraculous (eat your
heart out Duke). Unemployment is
falling, investment is rising, the bud-
get is very nearly balanced, real GDP
has grown 4-5 percent for three con-
secutive years and inflation hovers
about 12 percent a year. (Brazil's in-
flation rate is around 60 percent).
Furthermore, great steps have been
taken to diversify Chilean trade. Cop-
per, once Chile’s most important ex-
port now accounts for only 40 percent

of the trade receipts. Exports such as:
toys, computer software, defense
equipment, exotic fruit are becoming
increasingly important. Consequently ,
in 1987 Chile enjoyed a trade surplus
of $1.2 billion. If Pinochet loses in
Chile, he can come fix our economy,
right?

Wrong. Chile’s growth has been
‘paid for with domestic austerity; per
capita income is 12 percent below that
of 1981. Pinochet has forced ‘belt
tightening’ on his countrymen in a
way that would be impossible in a
democracy.

Sixteen political parties, including
both right and left wing groups, have
formed a coalition, ‘‘Command for
the No.’’ The Command is supported

MORE PARKING...

motor vehicles with the campus Security Office
makes clear the parking areas variously desig-
nated for specific categories of users. Common
sense often helps one recognize what is a parking
area and what isn’t. If one has the right parking
registration (sticker), parking in a parking area
that matches the sticker is not only permitted but
encouraged. Parking anywhere else on the Uni-
versity grounds is not only discouraged but is sub-
ject to penalties specified in the printed regula-

tions.

The University security officers assigned to en-
force parking regulations are trained to differen-
tiate between University parking areas and those
parts of the campus that are not parking areas. In
handling appeals of parking tickets I will depend

upon the good judgment of these officers in the

decisions involving:

— Whether or not the vehicle was in a desig- |*
nated parking area.

— Whether or not the vehicle is authorized to
park in the parking area.

— Whether or not one’s parking technique,
even when exercised within a designated parking
area, has introduced an unacceptable hazard to the
safety of others. Such a hazard may include, but is
not restricted to, the blocking of access to fire,
emergency, and service vehicles.

If anyone is in doubt about where they should
park, I'll be happy to tell them where to go. To
paraphrase the axiom that a former administrator
of parking justice at Lewis Hall used to quote:
‘You wrongly choose, you surely lose.’’

A win by the Command would ’
mean that Chile returns to a form of

lulu, Hawaii.

Compared to the association’s pre-
vious presidents, Rideout is unique.
He is only the third’ ABA treasurer in
the associatign’s pistory to become
president.

He is senior vice president and di-
rector of governmental affairs at First
Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C. First
Union is among the top super-regional
banks in the southeast.

Rideout has experience in lobbying
and serving on ABA committees that
prepare him for issues currently fac-
ing the ABA. He has served on the
government relations council, the
board of directors, and chaired the Fu-
ture Issues Task Force.

The ABA is the national trade or-
ganization for commercial banks. It
has about 12,000 members, which ac-
count for 95 percent of the nation’s
banking assets.

The banking industry faces issues
greatly pending on Congressional de-
cisions. Rideout is uniquely prepared
in dealing with the legislature as a di-
rector of governmental affairs at First
Union, and having chaired the Future
Issues Task Force for the ABA.

As president of the ABA, Rideout
has two primary concerns for the
banking industry this fiscal year. ‘‘A
resolution must be found for the fail-
ing savings and loans, and banks need
to broaden the types of products and

Interviews by Copeland Kapp

services they can offer,’’ said
Rideout.
Rideout identified the insolvent

thrifts as the industry’s main problem.
They cannot be liquidated by the
FSLIC because it lacks the capital.
Rideout dimly views one possible so-
lution of the FDIC assuming the
FSLIC’s debt: ‘‘It makes no financial
sense and would simply be unfair to
make banks bail out the‘S&L’s.

“Banks are currently frozen to a
small portion of the financial services
market; they can’t even compete with
the products and services other finan-
cial institutions can offer. As a trade
association, the ABA is involved with
the whole question of appropriate pub-
lic policy, meeting the needs of the
economy, and really meeting the
needs of the consumer,”” he said.

A European history major at W&L,
Rideout said education has always
been important to him. ‘*In addition to
the courses in history, I took courses
in political science and economics,”
he said.

“IT am encouraged to see W&L’s
continued emphasis on the liberal arts
with the additional discipline of cour-
ses in finance and commerce,”’
Rideout said. He cited the relationship
between the liberal arts departments
and the departments of commerce,
economics and politics at W&L as
unique and ‘‘doing a fine job of de-
veloping the various disciplines. ”’

He has returned for summer alumni
college sessions and last year spoke at
the spring alumni reunion, which was
his 25th. Rideout’s daughter,
Schuyler, is in the sophomore class at
W&L.

will attempt to get speakers who will
provide some insight into current and
upcoming events. He hopes to get two

senators to present the Democratic

In January, Contact will sponsor a
judiciary symposium in addition to a
possible appearance by a ‘‘big sports

lowed in February by a week-long
panel discussion of the present state of
business and industry.

Roach also discussed the possibility
of holding reaction- panels on a mon-

Someone should ask the governor
about Gerald Indelicato, a former ad-
visor and close friend whom Dukakis
named president of Bridgewater
(Mass.) State College in 1987. Indeli-
cato, while Dukakis was bellowing
about Edwin Meese during the week
of the attorney general's resignation,
was awaiting sentencing in federal
court in Boston; the Duke’s buddy had
earlier pleaded guilty to a series of
felonies involving bogus consulting
contracts.

Someone should ask the governor
about Francis Plilecki, whom Dukakis
named president of Westfield State
College in 1978. Plilecki resigned a
few years later after he was accused of
homosexual molestation. Neverthe-
less, the Duke and his buddies allowed
Plilecki to return to a professorship at
Fitchburg State College, where he had
been accused of making sexual advan-
ces to a young man in 1976.

Someone should ask the governor
about George Ripley, a former busi-
ness agent for the Bricklayers’ Union.
That union gave $5,000 to the Duka-
kis campaign committee on June 10,
1983, even though the Duke had been
elected just seven months earlier and

 

wouldn’t be up for re-election for
three years. Five days later, Dukakis
fired his state labor commissioner and
replaced him with— you guessed it —
George Ripley.

But Ripley didn’t last long. ‘Ihis pil-
lar of good government hired his two
daughters to work for him and was
eventually fined by the Massachusetts
State Ethics Committee and forced to
resign. It appears the Duke didn’t
quite live up to his pledge to abolish
“lock, stock and barrel’’ the rampant
patronage system that is Massa-
chusetts state government.

¢ Dukakis and the truth: The gov-
ernor says he is a member in good
standing of the Greek Orthodox
church who is able to receive all sa-
craments. Now I couldn’t care less
what religion Dukakis is, but I do
have trouble with fraud, and this reli-
gious claim appears to be just that.

First, the governor married outside
the church. Second, his children were
never baptized. Third, for 20 years he
has been ineligible to receive certain

sacraments. Furthermore, he has
Openly supported homosexual
*‘righs”’ and abortion.

As Bishop Kallistos, one of Greek
Orthodoxy’s leading theologians, ob-
served, ‘Dukakis has no right to pre-
sent himself to the American public as
a member of the Orthodox church.”’
Russian Orthodox Bishop Hilarian of

New York said, ‘‘It is rank hypocrisy
to identify oneself with a particular re-
ligious faith when one does not, in
fact, practice that faith or uphold its
moral precepts. A man of integrity
would not do this.”’

In short, the Duke is lying, probably

using the church to build some sort of

ethnic base. The question is, will the
national media question their candi-
date on this matter the way they but-
chered Pat Robertson over the date of
his marriage? Don’t bet on it.

According to Washington columnist
Pat Buchanan, when Evans and Novak
raised the religion issue in their
nationally syndicated column, The
Washington Post cut their article to
ribbons and left out vital quotes so that
the question of hypocrisy was hardly
raised at all. And, according
toNewsweek, ABC’s Sam Donaldson
said during the Republican convention
that the delegates there had ‘‘better be
glad I’m leaving the White House beat
in November, because, if Bush gets
elected, I'd savage him.”’

Clearly, in the few weeks remain-
ing, George Bush won’t be getting any
help from the Dukakis fans that con-
trol the evening news programs and
some of the nation’s largest papers. If
the truth about the Duke is to be
known, it won’t be Dan Rather and
company that tell it. The Vice Presi-
dent has his work cut out for him.

panel discussion. ”’

Financing for the 1988 series is
provided by the W&L Executive
Committee, which will provide
$17,000, and by the Inter Fraternity
Council, which Roach expects will
provide around $10,000.

Spencer
publishes
geology text

 

By Genienne Mongno
staff reporter

 

Edgar W. Spencer, professor of ge-
ology at Washington and Lee, re-
cently published the third edition of
his leading geology text, Introduction
to the Structure of the Earth.

In this new edition, Spencer pre-
sents a broad up-to-date review of
structural geology and tectonics (geo-
logical structural features as a whole).
The text also describes the structures
of the mountain system and the
oceanic crust in addition to the me
chanics of the deformation of the crus ,,

and their formation, large and small =

features and the way the features
form, Spencer said.

Professor Spencer received his
bachelor of science degree in physics
from Washington and Lee in 1953 and
his doctorate in major-structural ge-
ology from Columbia University in
1957. He joined the W&L faculty in
1957 and has been head of the geology
department since 1959.

Liberty Hall

Volunteers
sponsor Lee

memorial

A memorial service honoring Gen.
Robert E. Lee will be held at noon
Wednesday, Oct. 12, in Lee Chapel
on the Washington and Lee University
campus. The ceremony will mark the
118th anniversary of the death of Lee,
who served as president of Washing-
ton College from 1865 to 1870.

The memorial service is being spon-
sored by the Liberty Hall Volunteers.

The day’s activities will begin at

9:30 a.m., the time of Lee’s death in
1870, when the bells in the chapel will
toll 19 times — the equivalent of a
19-gun salute. At noon, the Liberty
Hall Volunteers, a group of W&L
students interested in Civil War re-
enactment, will march from Washing-
ton Hall to Lee Chapel.

Following the presentation of the
colors, Louis Hodges, W&L chaplain,
will give the invocation. Hodges will
be followed by Capt. Robert Peniston,
director of Lee Chapel, who will give
introductory remarks about Lee. The
W&L Glee Club will offer a selection
following Peniston’s remarks.

Taylor Sanders, professor of history
at Washington and Lee, will speak on
the life of Lee and his contributions to
Washington College. Benediction will
follow the W&L Glee Club’s singing
of How Firm a Foundation, Lee’s
favorite hymn. The service will then
adjourn.

Airport plans continue

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

The Rockbridge County Board of
Supervisors last week voted to begin
negotiations with a Herndon engineer-
ing firm that may be selected to update
the master plan for a county airport.

Campbell and Paris was selected in
a 4-1 vote after a motion to enter into
negotiations with Hays, Seay, Mattern
and Mattern was defeated 3-2.

The county had interviewed four
firms that were interested in the study
but rejected two of them last month.

Gene Lucas, a spokesman for
Campbell and Paris, said engineers
from his firm will attend the board’s
meeting Oct. 11.

While the firm has looked at the
existing master plan and what changes
may have to be made, Lucas said

Campbell and Paris engineers have
only begun examining the area, its
needs and a possible site. He said the
firm would not be prejudiced against
alternatives to the site selected in the
original master plan.

‘‘Our intention is to take into ac-
count the positives and negatives of
the existing site,"’ Lucas said, but
*‘there would be a need to investigate
other potential sites.”

If the board votes to allow Campbell
and Paris to update the plan, the
agreement between the firm and the
county would then go before the Fed-
eral Aviation Administration for its
approval.

Ninety percent of the cost of the
study would be paid by the FAA, and
the remaining ten percent would be
paid by the state and the local
governments involved.

Harriers sweep by |
ODAC-foe Roanoke §

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Racing in near-perfect conditions
last Saturday, the Washington and Lee
men’s cross country team turned in a
near- perfect performance.

The Generals (3-1) dominated the
proceedings, defeating Roanoke and
Norfolk State by identical 26-53
scores in a tri-meet on W&L’s 5-mile
course. Top honors belonged to senior
Bill Clark, who finished in a time of
27:51, dropping nearly two minutes
off his time from the week before.

W&L had five of the top nine fini-
shers in the tri-meet. Freshmen Char-
les Edwards (2nd, 29:07) and Lee
Parker (6th, 31:01), sophomore Ken-
non Walthall (8th, 31:36) and fresh-
man Bill Benson (9th, 31:49) were the
other scorers for the Generals.

‘I think we ran quite well,’’ said
head coach Dick Miller. ‘We had our
first two pretty close together.”

Miller said Edwards’ performance
was ‘‘a pleasant surprise,’’ but the

It was a good week for the Washing-
ton and Lee men’s soccer team. The
Generals went 1-1 for the week with
win over Hampden- Sydney and a loss
to eighth-ranked Messiah, making
their record to 4-3 on the season and
2-1 in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

On Saturday, the Generals made a
journey to Messiah College in Penn-
sylvania. Messiah was ranked No. 8
in the nation in Division III coming
into the game, making them the third
nationally-ranked team and the second
top-ten team that W&L has played this
season (North Carolina Wesleyan and
Johns Hopkins were the other two).

The final score was 2-0, but the
game was highly contested through-
out. It was just a case of Messiah be-
ing bigger and a little bit quicker than
the Generals.

team’s overall effort still has plenty of
room for improvement.

**We had our top five within four
minutes of each other,’’ he said. ‘*Not
good, but acceptable at this time of the
year.”’

Earlier last week the Generals
received some bad news. Sophomore
Larry Pilkey, one of W&L’s top run-
ners, was diagnosed as having a stress
fracture in his right leg. Pilkey, who
suffered the injury in the team’s first
meet of the season, will most likely be
out for the rest of the year.

The Generals will travel this Satur-
day to Catholic University in Wash-
ington D.C. to take on the host school
as well as Old Dominion Athletic
Conference rival Lynchburg.

As for the type of course the team
will run on this weekend, Miller has
absolutely no idea.

“It’s very difficult to access at this
time because you never know what it’s
going to be until you get there,’’ he
said. ‘“‘They never run the same
course two years in a row. So, I don’t
know where they are going to run it.”’

‘*They were undefeated, and ranked
in the top ten in the country,’’ said
head coach Rolf Piranian. ‘‘They
were significantly bigger than us and

quicker than we were.”’

Said senior co-captain Steve ‘‘Sid’’
Udicious, ‘‘We played really well.
They didn’t get their second goal until
late in the game when we were press-
ing to score the tying goal. They were
sharper than we were because they
had played more games, but as far as
them being better than us—if we could
have gotten a couple of breaks—we
could have beaten them.’’

In spite of the fact that the Generals
were undersized and overmatched,
they did not give up and got several
fine efforts from different players.

Macon football game goes

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

For the third straight year, the
W&L/Randolph-Macon football garne
went down to the final play. Only this
year, nobody won.

A pass from W&L junior quarter-
back Phillip Sampson was picked off
by Mike Hanson as the clock ran out,
but the Macon linebacker was tackled
at the W&L 33 to leave both teams
disappointed with a 10-10 tie.

While the game was not a loss, it
did cost the Generals (0-2-1) dearly.
Senior split end Keith Boyd, who had
caught one or more passes in 12
straight games, suffered a broken
right leg and will miss the remainder
of the season.

‘‘I’m very upset that Keith isn’t go-
ing to be with us,’’ head coach Gary
Fallon said about the loss of his top
pass-catcher. ‘‘He means so much to
us as a performer and a team leader.”

Even though the Generals lost a
starter, in a sense they found another.
Sampson alternated with junior Chris
Smythe throughout the afternoon, and
the former backup proved he deserves
to be considered for a starting role.

But Fallon prefers to see the play of
his two quarterbacks as complemen-
tary rather than competitive.

‘‘When Phillip’s in there, we ask
him to do some things we wouldn’t
ask Chris to do,’’ said Fallon, who
also calls on Smythe to do some
things—namely, running the op-
tion—that he rarely asks of Sampson.

And, while Smythe’s numbers (sev-
en of nine for 177 yards) were clearly
better than Sampson's (three of 10 for
85 yards, one touchdown and one

interception), Fallon is quick to point
out that Sampson played more downs
when Generals had to throw—and
when the defense knew it.

After W&L was stymied on its
opening drive, Macon started the scor-
ing with a 38-yard field goal by Mark
Palmgren with 6:45 left in the first
quarter.

The two teams exchanged punts be-
fore the Generals began a 3-play,
75-yard scoring drive.

After picking up four yards on two
plays, the Generals faced third and
six. Sampson found junior tight end
Bob Martin over the middle for first-
down yardage, but W&L would get
more than just a first down on the
play. Key blocks by Boyd, junior full-
back Russell Crosby and senior run-
ning back Tony Waskiewicz and some
nice footwork of his own gave Martin
a 70-yard touchdown reception and
the Generals a 7-3 lead.

In the second quarter, both head
coaches rolled the dice on fourth
down, and both coaches lost. But
neither team could capitalize on the
other’s gambles.

And, when the Yellow Jackets
threatened late in the half, W&L
senior linebacker Tom Skeen snagged
his team’s first interception of the
season. Skeen returned the picked-off
pass to the W&L 23, where the offi-
cials later said he stepped out of
bounds. Sampson came on to down
the football for the last play of the
half.

Macon came back in the third quar-
ter with a 14-play, 63-yard scoring
drive. Running back Mike Ste-
fanko—only a freshman—carried sev-
en times for 26 yards, including the
final two for Macon’s lone touch-

anian also said that freshman Chet
Lewis played some very respectable
minutes in his first varsity game.

“It was a hell of an effort on our
part,’’ said Piranian. ‘‘We were bea-
ten by a clearly better team, but we
were there the whole way. We had
some breakdowns. They outshot us
20-11, and if you get as many chances
as they did, something is bound to
happen.”’

On Tuesday, the Generals traveled
to Hampden-Sydney for a big ODAC
game. Last year’s game, which in-
cluded a fight, was won by the Tigers.

‘*Last year was a bitter pill for us to
swallow, because we outplayed
them,”’ he said. ‘*We just didn’t outs-
core them. I hope the officials will
control the game better than last year.
They have some ‘head hunters’ over
‘there, and if the refs don’t control the
game, it will be hard not to have a
physical game. They’re a good defen-

sive club, and this is a big ODAC
rivalry.”’

This year’s game was different than
last year’s. The Generals were never
challenged as they defeated H-SC 3-0.
Junior Scott Levitt scored early off an
assist from freshman David Hooker.
Levitt took Hooker’s pass and beat a
couple of Tiger defenders. His shot
came from about 18 yards out. It
snuck past the goalie and kissed off
the near post into the goal to give the
Generals a 1-0 lead. Senior Johnny
Sarber scored twice to provide the
final margin of victory off assists from
sophomore David Gilmore and senior
Mike Veliuona.

With only one conference game left
in the season, against Lynchburg on
Nov. 1, ‘‘the winner of that game will
probably win the conference title,’’
said Udicious.

The Generals play Marymount at
home this Saturday at 2 p.m. up on the
Liberty Hall field.

down to the wire — again

down. Palmgren’s kick gave the Yel-
low Jackets a 10-7 lead.

Neither team threatened until the
end of the period, when Smythe found
Boyd for a 47-yard gain and a W&L
first down at the Macon six.

But one of the biggest plays of the
game turned out to be the last of
Boyd’s career. The senior broke both
bones in the lower part of his right
leg, and the 2,000-plus fans at Wilson
Field waited in silence as the Lexing-
ton Lifesaving Crew and trainers from
both teams put Boyd’s leg in a brace
and carefully lifted him onto a stret-
cher.

When play resumed, Smythe car-
ried for a gain of one to give the Gen-
erals a second down at the Macon
five.

The Macon players had been talking
to the Generals all afternoon, and the
officials apparently decided they had
had enough. As the teams returned to
their huddles, the Yellow Jackets were
hit with an unsportsmanlike conduct
penalty that Fallon expected would
give his team an automatic first down.

Instead, according to Fallon, the
officials told him that the dead-ball

penalty did not include an automatic
first. The penalty moved the Generals
half the distance to the goal line, plac-
ing them on the Macon three.

Facing second and goal, Waskie-
wicz carried for a loss of one as the
third quarter ended.

‘‘We should have scored on that
play,’’ Fallon said later. ‘“‘One guy
came over the top and just got a hand
on Tony.”’

Smythe threw an incomplete pass
intended for Martin on third down,
and the Generals decided to settle for
the tie. Sophomore Carter Quayle
kicked a 28-yard field goal with most

They finally beat ‘em.

After three previous tries that ended
in nothing but frustration, the Wash-
ington and Lee women’s soccer team
scored a historic win over Hollins yes-
terday afternoon on Liberty Hall
Field. The Generals scored three
goals in the second half, including two
in the final ten minutes of play, to beat
Hollins 3-1.

Last season W&L lost all three
games it played against Hollins with
the most disappointing loss coming in
the first round of the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference tournament. All
three were games the Generals could
have—and probably should
have—won. This year’s contest,
however, was never in doubt.

“I really wasn’t in doubt,’’ said
head coach Jan Hathorn. ‘‘I would
have been very highly surprised if we
lost.”’

Junior Joelle ‘‘Action’’ Jackson put
the Generals on the scoreboard first
with an unassisted goal at 15:16 re-
maining in the game. It took Hollins
only a 1:08 to tie the score when Dan-
dridge Keyser beat W&L goalie
Sherri Brown and, suddenly, it looked

like the Generals were suffering from’

the same problems that afflicted them
a year ago.

“It’s a real ‘mental’ thing for us to
play Hollins because they’re Hol-
lins,”’ said Hathorn, who thought that

tinues to run well.

Last Saturday, the harriers
grabbed second place in a four-
team meet. Running on their home
course, the Generals came
up a little short against Norfolk
State, losing 27-35. W&l fared bet-
ter against Roanoke, downing the
Maroons 35-86, and Mary Bald-
win, 35-91.

Leading the way was sophomore

overall with a time of 22:21 on the

fact might have caused the Generals to
allow the tying goal so quickly.

But that was then, and this is now.
On what was easily the best and
prettiest play of the afternoon, junior
Catherine Baillio took a corner kick
from freshman Ashley Gray and
headed it past the Hollins goalkeeper.
It would prove to be the game winner
for the Generals.

“As far as the header, that’s pretty
much the idea but it doesn’t always
happen,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘We try to

get it to work. It’s a play we try to

run.

‘*[Gray] has one of the most accu-
rate shots. That's definitely one of our
plays because she is so good at it.””

She’s also not bad at scoring her
own goals. With under three minutes
left, Gray unleashed a powerful shot
that went off the hands of the goalie
and into the back of the net. With the
all-important insurance goal secured,
the Generals (4-5, 3-2 in the ODAC)
could relax somewhat and just run out
the clock.

WA&L played on the road last Satur-
day and lost a tough 6-0 game to high-
ly-ranked North Carolina Wesleyan.

‘This team is a great team,”” said
Hathorn. ‘‘I don’t see us losing unless
we're outplayed, as far as playing a
team that we’re equally matched
with.”’

The Generals will stay in Lexington
on Saturday to take on Sweet Briar.
Game time is 11:30 a.m. W&L then
travels to Lynchburg to play the Hor-
nets on Tuesday afternoon.

lona hot, polo not in N.E. Varsity Invitational

 

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

Washington and Lee’s water polo
team fell victim to one of the hottest
teams in the East last weekend at the
Northeast Varsity Invitational in
Providence, R.I. The Generals fin-
ished the weekend with two straight
wins, however, raising their record to
9-3.

After beating Iona in their last meet-
ing in Annapolis, the Generals came
out a little flat and fell behind 5-1 after
the first half and could never recover.
The final score was 10-5. Iona played,
without question, one of its best
games of the year against the Generals
and then went on to beat Bucknell in

“It’s third down and long for
Bridgewater College,’’ says the
commentator. ‘‘The quarterback
drops back, looks around and,oh
my, down he goes. What a hit! He
is thrown for a big loss on the sack
by number 61, Jimmy Johnson.”’

Just who is number 61, Jimmy
Johnson? No, he’s not the big-
- mouthed, slick-haired coach of
the Miami Hurricanes. He is senior
tri-captain on the Washington and
Lee football team. He also happens
to have been selected as The Ring-
tum Phi Athlete-of-the-Month for
the month of September. Johnson
recorded over ten tackles in each of
the first three games of the season
for the Generals.

J.J., as he is called by his
friends, stands 6’3‘* and weighs in
at 230 pounds. He is the anchor of
the defensive line and is leading the
team in tackles this season.

Against Randolph-Macon last
Saturday, he was in on seventeen

the semifinals of the tournament.

“It is kind of a mystery to me but
we were not up to par against Iona,”
said head coach Page Remillard. ‘“We
were playing low in the water. The
whole team had a bad game. Hopefu-
lly, this will be the only time it hap-
pens all season.”*

Remillard also said it was not a case
of the Generals tightening up because
of the pressure.

“I don’t think handling the pressure
is a problem,’ he said. ‘‘It’s just a
matter of developing a little contin-
uity. We were very sluggish against
Iona, and they kept our backs to the
wall the entire game.””

The Generals, who came into the
tournament ranked 17th in the nation,
bounced back from their first round

defeat to trounce a_ well-coached
M.I.T. squad 19-5. This set up a
meeting with Army for the third time
this year. It is always hard to beat the
Same team three times in one season
but the Generals rose to the occasion
and defeated Army 15-14 in double
overtime.

W&L was led by the strong perfor-
mance of senior David Reavy, who
contributed five goals and some great
play down the stretch. ‘‘Reavy took
control and played to win when it
counted,”’ said Remillard. Senior Da-
vid Deitz also contributed seven goals
to the victory.

The Generals will now look toward

where they will have the opportunity

Yellow Jackets quarterback Paul
Dillard. Against Centre College,
Johnson was in on close to fifteen
tackles.

What kind of an example does
Johnson set for his teammates?

‘‘Jimmy is definitely a leader by
example. He is a definite crazy
man, a monster on the field. His in-
tensity carries over to the other
players and makes them want to
compete at the same level he
does,’’ said freshmen Willie Hen-
derson and Jeff Kreis.

Said junior defensive lineman
Scott Silverman, ‘‘During the
game, Jimmy is the big play man.
When a big play needs to be made,
Jim Johnson steps to the forefront.
Every time I came off my block
and looked up, all I could see was
Johnson drilling the guy with the
ball.

Johnson hails from Atlanta, Ga.
and is a journalism major. He’s
been on the football team each of
his four years here and has lettered
each year. He says that the greatest
moment he has had over his career

| |[Athlete-of-the-Month

to secure a Division IH national
championship. W&L, currently ran-
ked second in D-H, will play both the
number one-ranked and number three-
ranked teams in the coun-
try—University of California at San
Diego and Claremont-Mudd-
Scripps—as well as Pomona-Pitzer in
the Claremont Invitational.

‘We can do a great deal for our
cause if we can sweep the California
trip,”’ said Remillard. ‘‘We can clinch
a D-III national title as well as im-
prove our position for Easterns. We
continue to hold our destiny in our
own hands. There are some teams that
find a way to win and some that find a
way to lose. We have to be one of
those teams that finds a way to win.”’

 

 

"Jim Johnson

was when the Generals tied for the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference
title during his freshman year.
‘‘What was so great was that we
won three games by a touchdown
or less. It was a tight race. It was
great the way we did it. Also, it
was the first winning team that I
had ever been on.”

 

 

Off the field, Johnson is not the
intense, big-hitting lineman that he
is on the field. In his free time, he
likes to go fishing as well as spend
time hanging around with his dog
Slug.

Congratulations to Jimmy
“J.J.”’ Johnson, The Ring- tum Phi

Cheaters are
never winners

Things were so much easier when you were a child. Think about it.
Homework consisted of cutting snowflakes out of white paper for the
Christmas play or making Mom that special Mother’s Day card. You
drank Kool-Aid by the bathtub-full, Toughskins were the fashion state-
ment and you weren't cool if you didn’t own a pair of puke-green Zips.

Your outlook on life was so much simpler too. What philosopher
could possibly argue with the theory of ‘‘finders keepers, losers
weepers’” or “‘never talk to strangers’’ or ‘‘I know what you are but
what am I?’ My favorite, however, was one my parents taught
me—‘‘cheaters never win.””

Ben Johnson cheated. And he didn’t win. Maybe, instead of bemoan-
ing the fact that Johnson took steroids and whining about the state of ath-
letics, we should be celebrating that Johnson was stripped of his gold
medal and banished from track and field. The system works—cheaters
never win. Well, maybe it’s not so simple after all.

The childhood idealogy doesn’t include the important phrase of ‘‘If
they get caught.’’ Despite all the money spent on drug testing at the
Olympics, it would be naive to say that all the winners were drug-free.
Two members of the Bulgaria weightlifting team cheated, got caught
and were stripped of their medals. The Bulgarians then proceeded to
pull the rest of their squad out of the competition, supposedly because of
embarrassment. Most people suspected, probably correctly, that the
Bulgarians thought they could beat the drug testing and when they
didn’t, realized that their remaining weightlifting competitors would all
test positive as well.

The technology of masking steroid use continues to be a step, albeit a
small one, ahead of drug testing technology. What of those who know
how to beat the system? Which makes me wonder: Who won because of
hard work and determination or who won due to better science? Steroids
have a valid medical use—they aid in the healing of torn or strained
muscles. But the steroid Johnson was on was being taken for more than
just the hamstring pull he suffered early this year.

It seems incredulous, but Johnson maintains that he did not knowingly
take steroids. Some sources speculate that Johnson has been taking ster-
oids for the past couple of years. Johnson’s personal physician, ---- As-
taphan, even bragged about being ‘‘responsible’’ for Johnson’s world-
record performance last fall at the World Championships in Rome. And
yet, Johnson continues to say he didn’t know what was going on. What
did Ben think he was taking? Aspirin? Vitamins?

Another question: Where does the athlete draw the fine line between
an ‘‘earned’’ victory and an ‘“‘assisted’’ one? How can any competitor
feel good about himself when he/she has had to cheat to win. The old
‘Everybody else is doing it, so why shouldn’t I?’’ saying just doesn’t
cut it any more. Carl Lewis, Kristen Otto, Matt Biondi and the other
gold medal winners didn’t use drugs.

Johnson’s life has been destroyed. He will probably never run compe-
titively again—but who really cares? Who know’s whether or not John-
son’s climb to the top of the men’s 100 meters was all brought about by
steroids?

As I said a couple of weeks ago, lucrative endorsements (read: mega-
bucks) can be had by Olympic champions. It’s ironic that the means
Johnson took to obtain those financial rewards, ended up costing him
everything he had gained so far.

There is no excuse for Ben Johnson. Fortunately for the Olympics and
sports in general, Johnson was caught. Mom and Dad were right in this
case—cheaters don't win.

NOTES-—Since I’m never right about these things, I’m going to ruin
every New York Mets fan entire winter. The Mets will win the World
Series in five games over the Oakland Athletics. How’s that for the
‘kiss of death?”’ All things considered, NBC did a nice job with its
Olympic coverage. Kudos especially to Marv Albert (boxing) and Char-
lie Jones (track). Lowlight of the Games had to be the U.S.-Soviet
Union basketball clash, Dick Enberg and Al McGwire were more em-
barrassing than the way the U.S. played. Would someone please inform
Enberg that it is ‘‘Bimbo’’ Coles and not Vernell.... Looking at the
games here in Lexington, the women’s athletic teams just keep getting
better and better. All three fall programs are off to fine starts, with the
volleyball team deserving special recognition for its inspired play, de-
spite being a first-year varsity program....

The Ring-tum Phi, October 6, 1988,

 

Again, Vienneau astounds chapel

By Margaret Pimblett
Staff Reporter

 

I exington concert-goers got a jump
on New York City this week when
Robert Vienneau, a W&L second-year
law student, gave a resoundingly suc
cessful piano concert in Lee Chapel
Tuesday evening

Vienneau presented a program of
nineteenth- and twentieth-century
compositions to a crowd which filled
the chapel to standing room only

He will play the same program in
New York City on October 24, in an
appearance sponsored by the W&l
New York alumni chapter and the
Canadian consulate. Vienneau is a
native of Montreal.

Each half of the concert, which
lasted an hour and a half with an
intermission, was well-balanced, with
a contemporary composition to begin,
slower melodic pieces in the middle,
and Liszt pieces showcasing Vien
neau’s virtuosity at the end

The evening began with George
Gérshwin's ‘‘Three Pre
ludes,*‘composed in 1926. These
three short pieces, influenced by the
jazz and popular music of the Twen-
ties, include much rhythmic variation
and syncopation. Vienneau handled
easily the intricacies of rhythm, and
was particularly impressive in the
second prelude, the slowest of the
three. He controlled the tempo and
meter well, resisting the temptation to
stretch certain notes to excessive sen-
timentalism within the blues-oriented
theme.

The middle section of the first half
included Chopin’s Ballade No. 1 in G
minor (1835) and Debussy’s Suite
Bergamasque (1905), including the
famous ‘‘Clair de Lune**. Vienneau
treated both with technical and inter-

pretive care, these two
Romantic compositions to be heard
free of maudlin banalities. The **Clait
de Lune” as exquisitely presented.

Vienneau concluded the first set
with Franz Liszt's ‘La Campanella,”
an energetic, highly-virtuosic work
which he played with hands flying and
fingers blurring. He was technically
amazing

After intermission, Vienneau
played a 1954 composition by Cana
dian Francois Morel, Deux Etudes de
Sonorite. The two-part piece consisted
of a slower opening section and a fast
close, *‘ Vif et Joyeux’’, with a driving
left hand which seemed almost to anti
cipate later rock music of the 1960's
and 70's.

Like the Gershwin, this piece had
much rhythmic complexity and syn-
copation. The piece was very accessi
ble contemporary music, although it
would never be confused with a
Beethoven piano sonata. Like many
performers of twentieth-century mu-
sic, Vienneau found it necessary to
use sheet music for this piece in order
to handle the contemporary rhythms
and melodies.

Rachmaninoff's Elegie in E-flat
minor (1892) was another late Roman
tic piece, allowing Vienneau to slow
down to a more lyrical, expressive
pace. This set the audience up perfec
tly for the final programmed selec
tion, Liszt’s Mephisto Waltz. As with
the first Liszt piece, Vienneau was
technically superb, with the opportun
ity to showcase his talent on a chal
lenging, fast-paced and_ highly
entertaining piece. The one difficulty
Vienneau faced during the Mephisto
was the small fly circling his head
while he played. He simply waved the
insect away, without missing a beat or
a note.

allowing

 

The audience gave a standing ova-
tion to bring Vienneau back for an en-
core, Robert Schumann's *‘Child Fall-
ing Asleep’’—a lullaby to pacify an
audience which wanted to hear even
more of Vienneau’s exceptional play-
ing. The piece was brief to the point of
abruptness, and was definitely too
short for some of the audience, who
kept applauding for some time after he
had finished

student, has given solo recitals annu-
ally since 1984, except for last year
(certainly excusable for a student be-
ginning a law education). He also has
accompanied university vocal groups,
including Southern Comfort, the Glee
Club and the University Chorus.

Lexington music lovers have be-
come accustomed to hearing perfor-
mances of exceptional merit whenever
Vienneau plays. Tuesday night’s con-
cert was a continuation of another fine
WAL tradition of excellence.

Clean & Sober disappoints; Betrayed disturbs

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

I was really beginning to wonder if
anyone was going to give Big Top
Pee-Wee a run for its money as worst
film of the year, but after seeing Clean
and Sober 1m not so worried any-
more.

Clean and Sober is simply the
year’s most disappointing film. Direc-
tor Glenn Gordon Caron begins the
film in documentary fashion in im-
pressive style but then sits by and wat-
ches it die. This film had all kinds of
potential for reaching out and making
a significant statement about drugs,
alcohol and the people who are addic-
ted to them. Unfortunately though, the
film weakens, gives in and dies just
like the addicts it attempts to follow.

Michael Keaton, who was hilarious
but shorted in his part in last year’s
Beetlejuice, is a gifted comic but
makes the same fatal mistake in Clean
and Sober that Bruce Willis did in

Poetics’

By Greg Ossi
Music Critic

I managed to listen to Stanley Jor-
dan and company play ‘‘Stairway to
Heaven”’ and never have a felt sorrier
for Plant, Page and the rest of
Zeppelin. The only thing that could
possibly beat this version out for
worst remake ever would be if the
London Philharmonic attempted it.

This is not a fusion song to be
played with sythesizers. Needless to
say if you can appreciate Led Zeppelin
even a little bit, stay away from this
song because it is horrible and will
only make you mad if you listen to it.

The Waxing Poetics have released a
new album entitled ‘*Manakin
Moon.** The Poetics are from Nor
folk, Virginia and have played at ‘‘the
Pit’’ and several fraternity houses in
town. This is their second album, fol-
lowing ‘‘Hermitage’’ which
released a little over a year and a half

 

was

Blind Date; that of acting outside his
forte.

As stated, Michael Keaton is a bril-
liant comic and has had great success
with parts in such films as Night Shift,
Mr. Mom and Beetlejuice. Note,
however, that Keaton’s successes
have come in comedies, every one.
Keaton gives an adequate perfor-
mance in the film, yet, he is not a
good enough dramatic actor to carry a
dragging film such as Clean and
Sober.

The film loses its potential by being
too simple. Drug Addiction and the
correction thereof carries many possi-
bilities for a quality film but the story
has to be more than problem-clinic-
b solution-have a nice life. After a
while therapy gets a little old; scratch
that, a lot old.

After so many promising previews
this summer, it’s very disappointing
that Clean and Sober couldn’t deliver.

ago.

With ‘‘Manakin Moon’’ they seem
to be moving in a different direction.
The playing is very solid but.... The
Poetics live sound comes from the
great rhythm and beat by drummer
Bill Shearin and bass player Sean
Hennessy. The drums are there but as
in their first album, Hennessy seems
to be lost in the mix. They also seem
to have abandoned their style of com-
bining ringing chords with melodic
leads. Instead they focus on the fuzz-
box and blistering leads.

The best song on the album *‘Baby
Jane’’ rocks. Even better, you can ac-
tually hear Hennessy, who is a very
talented bass player. If you buy the
album expecting more of the same you
may be disappointed.

**Downstairs’’ is
their old album. The fuzzbox is not so
up front.

On this album is a good cover of

On the flip side if there is one direc-
tor who knows how to make a film
about a controversial subject it is Con-
stantin Costa- Gavras.

The latest film from the mastermind
behind Zand Missing is Betrayed star-
ring Debra Winger and Tom
Berenger. Once again, Winger plays a
government agent, whose job this time
is to infiltrate a Klan-like group and
gather information on its leaders.
Berenger plays one of the leaders.

Betrayed isn’t great but is a good,
thought-provoking film that will make
you think. One scene in particular has
Berenger taking Winger out on ‘‘a
hunt,’” where members of Berenger’s
group kidnap a black man, let him go
in a heavily-wooded area and then
hunt him down like an animal.

If nothing else, Betrayed should
make you question what your defini-
tion of freedom is and whether or not
you think every person in this country
has it. If your answer is yes, in my
opinion, you're wrong.

Every person in the United States
technically has the same rights as any
other person, yet, it is scary to think
that someone’s rights can be stopped
when any other person thinks they
should be.

Many people will watch this film
and the anti-semetic and Ku Klux Klan
groups represented in the film and will
dismiss them as clinematic license.
They ‘re not.

They are realistic ahd dangerous
entities who believe they are a chosen
group. They believe they are Ameri-
cans before they are white supremi-
cists, yet they will say that someone
who is Jewish or black or homosexual
is that before they are American.

Betrayed is disturbing but a film that
anyone with a social conciousness
should see. It is beautifully directed,
well-filmed and well-acted. The end
gets tied up a little too fast, but for the
most part it is a quality film.

something memorable out of it. Other
songs on the album also just seem to
be there with nothing substantial about
them.

‘*Manakin Moon’’ is a mediocre
album by a very good band that will be
popular because it is by a hot local
band and if not compared to past per-
formances, a well produced, different
reacting recording.
