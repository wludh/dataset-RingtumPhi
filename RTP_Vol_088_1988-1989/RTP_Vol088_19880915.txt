Wilson letter warns of new drug policy

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

This summer, President John Wil-
son mailed a letter to students to warn
them of a change in Judge George
Honts’ courtroom policy towards stu-
dents found guilty of possession or
distribution of illegal drug charges.

In his letter Honts claimed that ‘‘the
effects of this court to deal with the
[drug] problem have been unsuccess-
ful...in terms of deterring the contin-
ued presence of illegal substances
among the student body in substantial
quantities.”’

He further stated in response to the
problem that the court [must] re-think

' its sentencing philosophy.”’

“‘My purposes,’ he continued,

“‘are to alert the students that in seri-

* ous drug charges upon conviction they
may face substantial losses of liberty,
money, and civil rights.’’

Not only are the courts planning
stricter enforcement of the drug laws,
but according to Lewis John, Dean of
Students, ‘‘There is no question that
the police in town are going to enforce
more strictly under-age possession
and consumption of alcohol in pub-

Tradition
remains

at W&L

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

' The W&L campus may have
_ changed over the past 123 years, but
the tradition of the Honor Code has
remained, according to one message
in English Professor Sidney Coullings
" speech to the Freshman Class.

The Honor Code has indeed re-
mained; however, revisions and
philosophical interpretations have
changed and molded it over the years
since Robert E. Lee first asked each

’ student to conduct himself as a
, gentleman.

Last spring, the Executive Commit-
tee voted on a few changes to the
White Book, the school’s honor
system guide.

One of the major changes allows a
third advisor or advocate to ‘‘be pre-

’ sent for the purpose of observation”’
. during closed hearings. This change
enables law students to gain experi-
ence by observing the proceedings.

. Thus, they are better able to serve stu-

dents at future hearings.

‘In order to insure confidentiality

during investigations prior to the hear-

" ings, the EC expanded Section III, O
+ to include ‘‘any student interviewed in

an investigation.’’ In the past although
students were warned that they would

be penalized for breaking the confi-

dentiality of the investigations, the

White Book only included ‘‘the ac-

» cused [and] any witness in an Execu-
tive Hearing’’ and did not apply to a
student interviewed but not called as a
witness.

Because the registrar’s office is
changing from hand-cut and pasted
transcripts to computerized tran-
scripts, the ‘whiting out method’’ to

’ denote whether or not a student is in
- good or bad standing has changed.
On the old manuscripts, the words
’ “Sin good standing’’ were typed to in-
. dicate that a student had not been de-
clared guilty of an honor violation. If
a student was charged with a violation
and withdrew before an executive
hearing or withdrew after being de-
clared guilty at the hearing, the regis-
trar simply omitted the words ‘‘in
* good standing.” If a student was de-
clared guilty, at the end of an open
trial, the words ‘‘in bad standing”’
were added to the transcript.

The new method, developed be-
cause the computer did not allow

‘ enough character space, uses the term
‘‘withdrew’’ to replace whiting out.
The term ‘‘dismissed’’ will replace
‘‘in bad standing.’’ If a student with-
draws for reasons not relating to an

~ henor violation, the term ‘‘withdrew”’

. W Il still be written on the transcript.

Another change excludes witnesses

ym the hearings while they are not

stifying. The reason for this change,
plained EC President Christopher

: Movellan, is because the commit-

2 ‘‘did not want witnesses remaining
and listening to other witnesses so in

» case they are recalled, their testimony

_ won't be changed or blemished by
what they have already heard.”’

De Movellan also explained that the
Committee did not change the Honor
Code to include student conduct such
as physical assault because, although

night when, as one sophomore who
requested anonymity noted, ‘‘Police
were crawling around everywhere
Saturday night. I almost got arrested
for walking around with an empty
cup.””

Along with local law officials, the
University faculty have also issued a
new stronger drug and alcohol policy.
Dorm counselors received a list of
non-discretionary or mandatory penal-
ties to be implemented in instances in-
volving illegal substances.

A freshman’s first infraction of the
no-use or possession of alcohol in the
dorms will result in four hours of ser-
vice. A second act will mean eight
service hours, and a third instance will
require a review by the Student Con-
duct Committee. Students will not
receive just a warning for their first
offense.

An automatic conference with the
Dean is a requirement for illegal drug
use Or possession.

Furthermore, in the past, students
arrested or hospitalized due to drug or
alcohol related instances did not
necessarily have to meet with the
Dean or other faculty member. Now,
however, a meeting with a faculty
member is required.

Dean John emphasized that this re-
sponse is ‘‘more counseling than puni-

é * . BS

(Left to right) Eddie Cameron, III, accepting for Eddie Cameron, ’24; Skip Rohnke, *60

tive.’’ He added, ‘‘In keeping with the
general spirit of the faculty, we will
want to talk to those students arrested
or hospitalized because of alcohol or
drug abuse.’’

One reas6n for this new policy is the
multiple attendance by W&L students
to the Stonewall Jackson Emergency
Room on certain weekends as a result
of alcohol related instances.

Dean John said, ‘‘If there is that
kind of abuse, the potential for some-
thing serious happening is there. As a
University, we have to face up to the
problems this creates.

Junior T.K. Bowers proved to be
slightly skeptical of the effectiveness
of the stricter laws. ‘‘I don’t believe it
will curb private drinking inside the
fraternities and at parties. It might
curb the mass public intoxications of
the good old days, and it will make
you be more careful in public.”’

Increased fear of liability and con-
cern with the new 21- year-old drink-
ing age has also affected the alcohol
policies at the fraternities.

Some national and alumni associa-
tions and corporations have prohibited
individual fraternity chapters from
providing alcohol out of private chap-
ter funds. In essence, this means kegs
are not allowed.

Hall of Fame’s first five
alumni inducted at game

 

Staff Report

 

A record-setting professional foot-
ball player and coach, a pioneer in the
Atlantic Coast Conference, one of the
finest basketball players to come out
of Virginia, a track star whose javelin
record still stands, and the winner of
16 varsity letters comprise the first
class of athletes to be inducted into the
Washington and Lee University Hall
of Fame.

The members of Hall of Fame’s in-
augural class are: Edmund M. (Eddie)
Cameron, ’24; Walter E. (Walt) Mi-
chaels, *51; Karl E. (Skip) Rohnke,
*60; Robert W. (Bob) Spessard, °39;
and Harry K. (Cy) Young, ‘17. The
inductees were chosen from a field of
70 nominees,

The Hall of Fame was established in
1987 by the board of directors of the
W&L Alumni Association to honor
and perpetuate the memory of those
individuals who have made outstand-
ing contributions to W&L athletics
and have helped bring recognition,
honor, distinction, and excellence to
the university and its intercollegiate
athletic program.

 

A native of West Virginia,
Cameron entered Washington and
Lee in the fall of 1920. A three-year
letterman in both football and basket-
ball, Cameron also served as captain
of both teams and was selected as All-
Southern Atlantic fullback. While at
Washington and Lee, Cameron served
as vice-president of the athletic coun-
cil, as president of the freshman coun-
cil, and as president of the monogram
club. He was also elected to Omicron
Delta Kappa, the national leadership
fraternity, in his sophomore year—an
unusual honor.

Upon leaving Washington and Lee,
Cameron worked as a coach before
going to Duke University where he
coached the Blue Devils to several
basketball championships. He served
as a long-time assistant in football to

the legendary Duke coach, Wallace
Wade. Cameron successfully coached
Duke to several football titles and one
Sugar Bowl victory during World War
II. He succeeded Wade as athletic di-
rector and remained in that position
until 1972. During his tenure at Duke,
Cameron served as chairman of the
basketball committees of the Southern
and Atlantic Coast conferences, where
he helped develop their tournaments
to national prominence. He was induc-
ted into the National Football Founda-
tion Hall of Fame in 1976.

Michaels was a member of the 1950
Washington and Lee football team,
the first and last football team ever to
represent the university in a_post-
season bowl game. Although the Gen-
erals lost to Wyoming 20-7 in that
game, the team finished 8-2 with
W&L’s first Southern conference
championship since 1934, and is gen-
erally considered the best football
team ever at Washington and Lee.
Michaels carried the ball 119 times in
his senior year for 712 yards—a 6.0
average—scoring 10 touchdowns and
kicking 29 extra points. He was
named second team All-Southern by
United Press International and third
team All-Southern by the Associated
Press.

Michaels started his professional
football career with the Green Bay
packers of the National Football
League, but gained prominence as a
linebacker for the Cleveland Browns
from 1952- -1961, where he was
named All-Pro several times. He ser
ved as an assistant coach with the New
York Jets and the Philadelphia Eagles
before returning to the Jets in 1976 as
head coach. He also served as head
coach of.the New Jersey Generals of
the United States Football league. Mi

Staggering arrest figures from last
Saturday’s rush activities and strict
warnings for those to come in the next
few weeks dominated Tuesday even-
ing’s Interfraternity Council meeting,
held at 7:30 p.m. in the University
Center.

Chief Beard of the Lexington Police
Force addressed the various rep-
resentatives of Washington and Lee’s
sixteen fraternity houses as well as the
Judicial Board that presides over the
council.

“Last Saturday night, this town was
out of control,’’ said Beard. Police ar-
rested twenty-nine minors in posses-

‘| sion of alcohol, as well as eight per-

sons for drunkenness in public, five
for Driving Under the Influence, and

 

ters from purchasing alcohol with
chapter funds when a party is hosted
by two or more fraternities. Rush

were in 1987, and all parties through
the end of Rush, September 26, are

six for littering. While Beard assured
that not all arrests were W&L stu-
dents, he pressed the fraternities’ re-
sponsibility for all persons in or
around their house at the time of a
party.

Responsibility was the theme for
Chief Beard’s speech, which stretched
through more than haif of the forty-
minute meeting. He reminded dele-
gates of the necessity in obtaining a
permit on the Thursday or Friday
preceding a party, and is requiring the
fraternity presidents to apply in person
for this week’s activities, placing them
in full responsibility for the occurren-
ces at their house. ‘‘We understand
that you are going to party, but you
have to understand that it is your re-
sponsibility ,’’ he summed up.

“I see the same repetition of this

hearing that each of the sixteen frater-
nity houses had already hired a band
to play Saturday night. ‘‘What are you
going to do to prevent this?’’ he asked
the presidents. ‘‘We cannot continue
the way that we’re going.”’

The general tone of the delegates
was that they would be more watchful
in enforcing the rules as laid down in
the By-Laws of the Interfraternity
Council Constitution. Among these,
the need for a brother at the door of a
party was stressed, but to regulate the
inflow and outflow of guests to the

served as captain of each team at
different times during his four years at
Washington and Lee. In track and
field, Rohnke received the Forest
Fletcher Trophy for the most points
scored in his sophomore, junior, and
senior years. He also received the
P.R. Brown Trophy for the most val-
uable athlete and the Wink Glasgow
Award for spirit and sportsmanship in
his senior year. As a junior, Rohnke
broke his own school record in the
javelin at the Penn Relays (200°

school record in the javelin (211°
3'%’’) that still stands.

In swimming, Rohnke was_ the
Southern League champion in the
50-yard freestyle, and conference
champion in the 400-yard medley. He
was awarded the Memorial Swimming
Trophy in 1958, the same year he
broke the school record in the
100-yard freestyle. In soccer, Rohnke
was a member of the first annual
VISA Tournament team and was
named All-South right fullback. Dur-
ing Rohnke’s years at Washington and
Lee, his teams compiled the following
records: track and field, 19-8; soccer,
24-14-3; and swimming, 27-4.

A native of Roanoke, Spessard at-

he starred in football, basketball, and

the fall of 1935 and made All-State in
basketball for three successive years,
1935-37. He was also named to the
All-Southern Conference team those
same three years.

At that time, the Southern Confer-
ence was among the strongest in the
country and included such teams as
North Carolina, Virginia, and other
Southern powers. During the Wash-
ington and Lee vs. North Carolina
game in 1936 Spessard scored 25

AIDS

Speaker alerts students
to the AIDS epidemic

AE NTO ESS EERIE LTE EID ELDER EEE
By Carli Flippen and Pamela Kelley

Staff Reporters

 

Addressing an audience primarily
of freshmen Monday night, Dr. Ri-
chard Keeling, Director of Student
Health at the University of Virginia
and chairman for the AIDS Task
Force on university campuses, spoke
on AIDS and other sexually transmit-
ted diseases.

Dr. Keeling’s lecture centered
around two common questions con-
cerning AIDS: What are the causes
and effects of AIDS? How can contact
with the AIDS virus be prevented?
Keeling combined a straight forward
attitude and humor to effectively con-
vey the AIDS/STD information to
students.

Keeling described the different vir-
uses that cause STDs, all of which be-
long to the ‘“‘HV”’ virus family. He
then explained how the AIDS virus at-
tacks the body’s immune system,
weakening it and leaving it vulnerable
to infection or disease and ultimately
death.

Keeling also discussed some of
America’s irrational fears about
AIDS. He deemed the cruel and/or
stand-offish attitude many take
towards AIDS victims as ‘‘emotional-
ism’’. To combat the fear of AIDS,
Keeling stressed that truth and myth
concerning AIDS must be separated.

He assured the audience that casual
contact, mosquitoes, or even kissing
cannot transmit the virus. However,
kissing may transmit other STDs such
as Herpes (Simplex IT) and Hepatitis.

Keeling stressed that although some
groups of people have a greater risk
for AIDS contraction, no one is im-
mune. He said that 3 of every 1,000
people may be carriers of the AIDS
virus and may infect others, and cited
statistics which state that by 1993,
drunk driving, murder, and suicide
will have been surpassed by AIDS as a
cause of death in the United States.

While Keeling said that abstinence
was the only 100% effective way to
escape AIDS infection, he suggested
that the correct use of condoms will
help reduce the risk of contact with the
AIDS virus. He also suggested that
drinking alcohol may dull ones judg-
ment, leading to unplanned experi-
ences that could bring them in contact
with the AIDS virus.

Keeling’s lecture was followed by a
report to the students by W&L physi-
cian Dr. Jane Horton-Marcella. She
revealed that the infirmary has dealt
with 186 students concerning STDs in
the past year. The visits ranged from
counseling for those with STDs to
testing or notification of those who are
at risk to contract an STD. Horton-
Marcella appealed to the students to
be responsible and make use of these
services available to them on campus
and stressed that all student informa-
tion concerning the virus is confiden-
tial.

AIDS/STD testing is available at the
university infirmary where one may
also discretely obtain condoms.

Horton-Marcella and Dr. Robert
Pickral, W&L’s Student Health Direc-
tors, and Keeling were on hand after
the lecture to answer questions.

W&L ranked

Washington and Lee University is
one of only two Virginia institutions
of higher learning to receive the
‘*most competitive’ ranking in the
1988 edition of Barron’s Profiles of
American Colleges.

The College of William and Mary is
the other Virginia school that received
the designation.

‘“*We are pleased that the volume

OPINION

Editorial
fascism

on the Phi

It is my privilege to inform students, professors, administrators,
employees, alumni (living and deceased) and other affiliates of the
Washington and Lee community that I have been appointed Editor-
ial Editor of The Ring-tum Phi. No one knows exactly how it hap-
pened, but many campus authorities believe that my appointment is
the work of a powerful fascist organization that is on a mission to
destroy The Ring-tum Phi. Other campus officials believe that it is
simply a joke that went too far. But regardless of who is responsi-
ble, the fact remains that I am now the Editorial Editor of the third
most important newspaper in the nation (after the N.Y. Times and
the Washington Post). I now have something that I have waited for
all my life—power. And just like Atilla The Hun who also started
out as the Editorial Editor of his college newspaper I plan to abuse

 

this power.

I am aware that many of my classmates, friends, and relatives do
not believe I am qualified for this astute position. These critics don’t
think I am experienced with important political positions. The truth
is that I was very recently involved in a career that required judg-
ment, fortitude, discipline and an orange helmet—the four charac-
teristics which mark a great leader. I know many readers are won-
dering what year I was President of the United States or Ambas-
sador to Nepal so in order to satiate this rampant curiosity I will

reveal my recent career.

As a fifth grader at Dale Mabry Elementary School in Tampa,
Florida, I was the Captain of the Patrols, responsible for making
sure that every single student returned home safely. Furthermore, I
was expected to maintain a crew of enthusiastic subordinate pa-
trols—all of whom were reaching the veritable apex of their rebel-
lious youth. As a Captain I was considered one of the best. It was
not uncommon to find me camouflaged in oak trees or crawling
through underbrush in order to catch derelict patrols sitting down
on the job or throwing rocks at each other. Throughout the year I
sustained an impressive record of 0 deaths—4 bloody noses—1 con-
cussion. Now that I have definitely proved my credibility I will
move on to the point of this editorial diatribe. We welcome letters,
criticism, essays, novels, diaries and anything else from any literate
member of the Washington and Lee community. Please bring any
submission to The Ring-tum Phi office in the University Center or
hand it to a trustworthy staff member unlike myself.

Nostalgic
words gnaw
at Senior

 

MY VIEW
By Susan C. Lewis

 

The shock can be overwhelming if
one thinks about it too long. The mail-
out sitting before me reads: ‘‘All
Seniors. The Career Development and
Placement Office Presents the Senior
Placement Meeting.’’ At the bottom
are even more ominous words: ‘‘Want
to have a job by the time you graduate
or soon thereafter? Then you must be-
gin now.”’ Begin now? But we’re all
supposed to have one more year of
college left—must we think about jobs
now? And to make sure it all hits
home even harder, Monday was
Senior Convocation—an event just to
honor us seniors, and to make us real-
ize that in a short nine months, we’ll
be walking down the Colonnade for
real, as our families watch eagerly.

It seems as if everyone I've talked to
cannot believe that the years have
flown by so fast. As we sit around,

talking and reminiscing, it seems like
only yesterday that we were the wide-

eyed freshmen who just arrived on
campus, It hardly seems possible that
the wild, exciting, and brand new ex-
periences of sophomore and freshman
years happened as long as two and
even three years ago. Looking back, I
distinctly remember the summer be-
fore sophomore year, when, in re-
sponse to the questions of friends of
the family, I eagerly exclaimed: ‘‘I
just can’t wait to get back to school!”’
They looked at me fondly, and re-
plied, ‘‘Don’t be so eager—you’re
wishing your life away.’’ At the time I
simply laughed their statement
off—not giving much thought at all to
anything except how much fun it
would be to be back at W&L. Now, as
an older and more mature (or so they
tell me) senior, I finally understand
what those people were trying to tell
me. Perhaps not completely, since
they have seen many more years pass
than I have, but enough so to realize
that every time I thought I simply
couldn’t wait for a specific event, I
was, in effect, wishing away—almost
wasting—every day in between.

But all these thoughts still leave me
and all my classmates with only nine
short months between us and gradua-
tion. Truthfully, at times I am not
looking forward to that at all. And it
isn’t simply because I am afraid to
face the ‘‘real world’’ in an attempt to

find a job (although at times, quite
honestly, that is a small fear). Much
more than that, it is the idea that my
four years at Washington & Lee are
drawing to a close. In my mind, this
university is one of the best in the
country—in more ways than one.
Academically, I have learned a great
deal here, and enjoyed doing
it—except a few all-nighters—thanks
to the wonderful professors here.
Also, what could be more relaxing
than stretching out in the sun, on a
warm spring day in front of the Co-
lonnade. Certainly few colleges offer
a more picturesque setting. Perhaps
most important are the deep friend-
ships which are fostered here. In part
because of the many experiences we
have shared, college friendships seem
to be the most treasured and meaning-
ful. I, for one, hope and pray that
these friendships will not diminish,
but instead strengthen, even as we
may physically be separated.

So, in many ways I dread the ap-
proach of June 1, 1989, but I hope
these are not selfish ways. I also hope
I will remember the basis of these re-
grets after graduation, so that I will
keep alive in practice those aspects of
life treasured most at W&L. If I may
leave one piece of advice to under-
classmen: take care to appreciate your
years here and do everything you want
to do for, as they say, these are indeed
the best years of your life. And to the
seniors—may this year be the best of
all four we’ve had here.

Man’s journey

from giant slugs
to the suburbs

 

By Jon Sbar

 

Soon after man evolved from the
Giant Slug, he started walking. His
walk soon became a mission of impor-
tance, a search for a vital necessity.
This vital necessity was not food,
clothing or shelter (only later did man
realize he needed these things), but an
experience that would soon come to be
known as a good time. Eventually,
man ran (walked) into other men and
decided that he was a social animal.
Man then proceeded to gather some
wood and form small tribal communi-
ties which the intellectuals began to
call the suburbs.

Everything went fine in the suburbs
until man discovered that some men
were women. Initially, the only no-
ticeable difference between men and
women was that men loved ‘‘The
Three Stooges’’ while women
detested them. But one late evening in
a dark cave a man everyone called Bill
discovered something he called
Unique Female Physical Characteris-
tics which made women more fun than
other men. The women decided the
same thing about the men and there-
fore started to wear make-up and
complain that they were getting fat

even though they never did anything
about it.

After Bill’s important discovery
men and women began living
together. Family life was peaceful and
satisfying—couples were happy with
simple pleasures such as drawing on
the cave walls. Males and females re-
mained on friendly terms for what
seemed like, and actually was,
thousands of years. In fact, some re-
lations were so good that men and
women went from their Giant Slug
days well into the twentieth century
without having an argument. Actu-
ally, they had one little disagreement
stemming from the invention of beer
which the men loved to drink while
they watched ‘‘The Three Stooges.”’
Because they felt that the men spent
entirely too much time doing this, the
women invented nagging. Tragic as it
may be, the days when men and
women could get along have become a
dim memory. Somehow that long era
of good feeling between the sexes
turned into a merciless war consisting
of relentless battles.

Male-female relations are currently
in a dangerously precarious position
and deteriorating every day. Modern

LETTERS

women read books like, ‘‘Men vs.
Blue-Green Algae; which makes a bet-
ter companion?’ ‘‘Zen without
Men,”’ and ‘‘101 Things to do if you’-
re Celibate.’’ Modern men, on the
other hand, have minimized their
reading to the three paragraph inter-
view of the ‘‘Playboy Playmate of thé
Year’’ which they believe holds the
answer to any philosophic, psycholo-
gical, or physiological question con*
cerning females. If the sexes cannot
improve their rapport in the very near
future, I fear they will split perman:
ently leaving man to drink beer and
watch ‘‘The Three Stooges’’ twenty-
four hours a day.

The male-female controversy has
become a top priority in the scientific
community. Although researchers

To the Editors:

I am writing this letter to make clear once and for
all the alcohol policy for the Wednesday night
bands in the GHQ. As most returning students
remember, there was an incident last spring, in
which an underage drinker was caught by the Vir-
ginia A.B.C. As a result, the GHQ was fined, lost
its beer license temporarily and was severely war-
ned that the next infraction of the A.B.C. laws
will result in a greater fine and possibly a perman-
ent loss of its beer license.

In order to protect our ‘‘Wednesday in the Pit’’
the managers have no choice but to create and en-
force a stricter drinking policy effective imme-
diately when the GHQ regains its beer license on
September 27. In order to purchase beer, ALL

students must show two forms of ID:

1. A valid drivers license with photo or a state
identification card with photo.

2. A second form of ID such as a college ID or a
military ID.

A college or military ID will only be considered
secondary identification and will not be accepted
unless presented with a valid drivers license or
state ID card. This is in accordance with the VA
ABC alcohol purchasing policy.

All GHQ employees have the right to card any
customer at any time. Any person who presents a
false ID will have it confiscated and it will be
turned into the VA ABC. If the ID has come from
a W&L student, that student will be referred to the
E.C. and/or the §.C.C. for appropriate action.

Any person who is found drinking underage will
be ejected and referred to the S.C.C,

I would like to address another issue now, be-
fore the pit reopens. Many students complain that
the presence of a strong honor system should al-
low legal drinkers to drink without showing ID or
just a Washington and Lee ID. Unfortunately, the
ABC doesn’t agree. We must follow their guide-
lines if we want to continue to operate as a tavern ,
in any Capacity.

Please keep in mind that these rules are not ’
meant to keep people from having a good time,
merely an effort on our part to retain our beer |i-
cense.

New abscence policy causes very few problems

 

By Becky Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

The new clarification of professors’
attendance policies commenced this
week with little « ntroversy from stu-
dents or professors but its really too
early to tell, University Registrar D.
Scott Dittman said.

Dittman said that so far he has not
received any complaints or problems
concerning the new clarification. “‘Its
too early to tell. 1 don’t expect feed-
back on this until the middle of next
week,”’ he said.

The 1987 Faculty Handbook says
that because W&L offers such a wide
range of classes and teaching styles, a
student’s participation in a course

 

Philip Morris

cannot be prescribed on a University-
wide bSasis. ‘‘For this
reason...attendance in class and
laboratory is a matter between the stu-
dent and the faculty member.”’

Last spring, a clarification was ad-
ded that said, *‘Faculty members may
require a previously registered student
to drop a class if the student misses the
first class meeting of the term without

A Washington and Lee alumnus was
indicted last week by a Rockbridge
County grand jury and accused of
stealing porcelain worth approxi-
mately $10,000 from the university’s
Reeves Center.

R. William Mercer, 22, who gra-
duated from W&L in June 1988, will
be arrested Friday, according to Lt. _
Steve Crowder of the Lexington®
Police Department.

longing to the center on or about Aug.
4, 1988.

Mercer worked at the Reeves
Center as an undergraduate and also
worked at the center during the sum-
mer after he graduated, according to
John Elrod, Dean of the College.

Elrod said Mercer ‘‘was a good stu-

dent here’’ and said he was confident
“that the courts will do the right
thing.’’ Elrod called the arrest ‘‘a
very unfortunate set of circumstan-
ces.””

University officials said the artifacts
were safe but refused to discuss details
of the case, saying that W&L em-
ployees may be called to testify.

Tavern renaissance -
replaces ‘60s decor

 

By Heidi Read
Editor

 

A new General’s Headquarters?
Maybe not new, but definitely im-
proved.

Monday’s opening of the GHQ after
a summer remodeling project left
people waiting on the steps to get in
during the lunch rush, according to
Gerald J. Darrell, director of Univer-
sity Food Services.

Darrell said he had hoped to have
the remodeling completed earlier so
that equipment could be tested and
staff could get accustomed to the new
setup, but it didn’t work out that way.
Instead, he has been ‘‘acting chef”’ at
the GHQ.

Darrell said it will take time to ad-
just to the new setup, ‘‘but eventually
customers will not wait more than
15-20 minutes to get served.

 

What do y

 

 

 

 

“Ttch”’
‘*My Mother’’—‘‘I think it’s ex-
cessive. The school should have no
interest in what people do in their
own time.””

Chaffe, senior,

 

from

Lee Ann Foster, sophomore,
Rome, GA—‘‘It would be better
for the school to do more counsel-
ing as opposed to being kicked out
of school.”’

‘*We haven’t done it yet, but we
will. We’re going to make it.’’

The GHQ, formerly the Cockpit,
was built in 1969 as part of the Uni-
versity Center. It was intended to be a
student tavern, Darrell said, but in the
process of its construction it was real-
ized that Virginia law required that
hot food be served with alcohol.

Darrell requested a larger kitchen
five years ago, but the GHQ remodel-
ing was not a priority in the University
budget until this year, he said.

Beginning the day after graduation,
a construction crew worked every day
of the summer, ‘‘gutting out’’ the old
kitchen, enlarging it, installing new
equipment, making a new U-shaped
bar and rearranging the seating.

The new kitchen is three times the
size of the old one, which Darrell said
was intended to be a storage closet.
Even after the remodeling Darrell
said, ‘‘It still looks like we have more

”

room.

prior approval of the instructor.”’
Dittman said that this clarification
was added last spring because of prob-
lems of controlling enrollment. He
said, ‘‘Professors need to know who is
going to be in the class especially in
Spring term. They need to have con-
trol over their class enrollment.”’
Dittman also pointed out that stu-
dents who do not attend first classes
but do not drop them are being unfair
to other students who want to get into
closed classes. ‘‘The biggest day of
drop/add week in every term is Fri-
day, which is almost too late for oth-
ers to add classes. It’s just not fair to
the other students,’’ Dittman said.
Kathy Jo Koberstein, Assistant
Professor of Romance Languages,
said that she supported the new clari-
fication because her classes almost in-
variably wind up with a waiting list.
Koberstein said that she did let one
student into a class on Monday be-
cause of the new rule but also let a

student who missed the first class stay
enrolled in it because he had a
reasonable excuse.

“*T wouldn’t enforce it except in a '

class where there is a waiting list. We
need to know if a student is in the
class, especially in the Department of
Romance Languages,’’ Koberstein
said.

Professor of Romance Languages
Sidney J. Williams, Jr., said that the
new clarification has not affected him
yet, but it may by next week.

Henry Sharp, Jr., Professor of
Mathematics, said that the new policy
would cause no departmental change
but that he could not speak for indivi-
dual professors. About his own pol-
icy, he said, ‘‘I will handle absences
very much the same as always.”

According to Junior Leigh Ann
Brown and others, the new clarifica-
tion seems difficult to follow before
the first day of classes for those who
are not oriented with their professors.

Brown said, ‘‘There are too many
innocent situations that could come up
on the first day and ruin students’
schedules. It may be an appropriate
policy for students who sleep through
their classes but not for those with real
excuses.

“I question whether many profes
sors are really taking it [the new clari
fication] to heart. Almost all of the
professors here are very reasonable
and understanding so I don’t foresee
them doing much to those innocent
students. ”’ :

In a letter to all -W&L undergra
duates, Dittman requested that profes
sor’s instituting the new policy con
sider the University’s recognition of
the importance of holy days and to
make needed accommodations for
students’ observances, which was es-
pecially important this year as Rosh
Hashanah fell on the first day of clas
ses.

New orientation week greets frosh

By Lori Richardson
Staff Reporter

 

The Freshmen began rolling into
‘*Big Lex’’ on Sunday and Monday of
Labor Day weekend. They faced a
week-long orientation that included
lectures, meetings, picnics, par-
ties and numerous introductions to fa-
culty members, upperclassmen, and
fellow freshmen. Orientation °88,
although it included the hectic sched-
ule, early hours, and exciting anticipa-
tion that is typical of the first week of

campus introduction, was indeed
different from Freshman orientation
of past years at W&L.

Pre-Orientation for minority and
international students added a new
dimension to this year’s welcoming
activities. Moving in prior to the rest
of the Class of °92, these students
were provided additional time to settle
in and adjust to campus living. Ac-
cording to Chelsea Porter of New Ha-
ven, Connecticut, Pre-Orientation
also allowed this select group to meet
more upperclassmen.

‘‘This is the year that Freshmen
could be Freshmen and not be rushees
during Orientation,’’ commented
Mary Alice McMorrow, Dorm Coun-
selor and one of three founders of a
committee to involve ‘students in the
planning of Freshman Orientation.
Fraternities exerted much less _in-
fluence on students participating in
Orientation this year than in recent
years. Freshmen, then, had time to get
settled before they had to begin mak-
ing social decisions that could have
great impact on their years at W&L.
Kara Cunningham, a Junior involved
in coordinating Orientation, feels that
Freshman class unity was enhanced
this year because the fraternity scene
did not further divide the women from
the men or the students looking at a
variety of different houses.

Described by one Freshman as
“‘taxing,’’ the week began with a wel-

come from President John Wilson to .

parents and to the Class of ‘92. Organ-
ized to provide a program with a daily
focus on either academics, the Honor
Code or increasing familiarity with
the University, the week proceeded
with a series of placement tests, lec-
tures, and a panel discussion.

The panel discussions concerning
the heritage of the university were the
most popular non-social event. The

panels were composed of students,

alumni and faculty in an informal set-
ting to speak with the Freshmen on to-

 

 

TALKBACK

 

 

 

men

pics that could not be discussed in
pamphlets or lectures. The panel dis-
cussions were also ‘‘brief,’’ a word
used rarely to describe Orientation
week meetings.

Parking permits and Student Tele-
phone Union fees were taken care of
early in the week when parents (and
their checkbooks) were still in town.

Despite the fact that many Fresh-
men felt that certain meetings were
redundant or even irrelevant, good
times were had at the Alumni Associa-
tion barbecue on Tuesday evening at
the Student Pavilion. Then at the Pavi-
lion party on Friday night the stu-
dents, had a chance to mingle with the
upperclassmen while hanging out to
the beat of ‘‘Locals Only.’’ Both
events sported a large turn-out. Ac-
cording to Wally Backdayan of Nat-
chitoches, LA, ‘‘outside of the long
walk, it was fun.’’ the Adopt-A-
Freshman picnic on the law school
field was also a success.

One potential party that never got
off the ground was the Mocktail Party
to be held on Wednesday night in
honor of the grand re-opening of the
General’s Headquarters. Confusion
resulting from the IFC changing con-
tact rules at the middle of the week
and behind schedule construction

work on the GHQ meant that less than
half of the Freshmen were aware that
the party was even scheduled.

Freshmen and Dorm Counselors
alike comment that Orientation week
was ‘‘too dragged out’’ and many as-
pects were ‘‘redundant.’’ Greg Dun-
ford, a Freshman from Fairfax, Va.
suggested that Orientation Week
should be reduced to two or three
days. Many changes and improve-
ments were made this year, though,
predominantly in providing a more
organized, more convenient schedule.
In addition, a concerted effort was
made to break down the class into
groups so as to reduce the size of the
meetings. A committee has been
formed to insure that student ideas are
taken into account when planning
Orientation week for next year. Acti-
vities such as the Student Activities
Fair and Luncheon were a big success
and turn-outs for the social events
were larger than in recent years. Ac-
cording to Mary Alice McMorrow,
Orientation is ‘‘not meant to be a rip
roaring time,’’ but the Freshmen were
able to get to know one another, talked
with many upperclassmen, and cer-
tainly became more familiar with the
rich tradition and atmosphere of
Washington and Lee.

cohol brought to the party by guests,
making certain not to serve anyone
who is obviously intoxicated or is get-
ting out of control. The fraternity
brothers are also responsible for
taking care of guests, including fe-
males from other colleges, who have
passed this point of intoxication and
making sure they are safe until morn-
ing.

‘*This is not Bourbon Street,’’ said
the Chief, commenting that several
girls from neighboring colleges were
literally afraid of the situation Satur-
day and were gathered around police
cars, requesting assistance and protec-
tion.

One fraternity president complained
about being awakened by a police
officer at eight o’clock Sunday morn-
ing and issued a citation for litter in
his house’s back yard. ‘‘This is har-

assment from my point of view,”’ he
said, contending that the litter was not
visible from any street. ‘‘It doesn’t
have to be visible,’’ countered Chief
Beard. ‘‘But it does have to be proper-
ly contained.’’ One By-Law of the
IFC Constitution states, in fact, that
there are to be five trash containers
near the entrance to the house.

The IFC delegates assured that they
would attempt to help the police in any
way they could, especially by making
sure that the IFC By-Laws were fol-
lowed. Chris Willard, secretary of the
council, read the ‘Guidelines for Safe
Partying’ from the By- Laws. The Ju-
dicial Board subsequently promised to
enforce these at the individual frater-
nities through the guidelines of rules
and punishments outlined in the Con
stitution.

‘The police are not in the mood [to
give us] a lot of breaks,’’ summed up
IFC President Ross Singletary.

Other main points of the meeting in
cluded a reminder for the house stan-
dards inspections and deadlines, a
passed motion that the fraternities be
arranged by alphabetical order in the
Rush Date Registration this Friday,
and a review of the rush calendar.

Polo downs Army
twice in Fall Classic

Generals to play best teams in East

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Despite returning almost its entire roster from the year
before, Washington and Lee has a different water polo
team this year.

‘I don’t think it has to do with X’s and O’s,”’ said head
coach Page Remillard. ‘‘I think the significant adjustment
or change I see in this team is maturity.”’

The Generals showed the kind of composure their head
coach referred to when they twice beat Army, one of the
East’s best polo teams, and captured the W&L Fall Classic
title last weekend at Cy Twombly Pool. It was a case of the
veteran seniors on the team working in unison with a tal-
ent-laden freshman recruiting class.

“The seniors are doing an outstanding job of teaching
the freshmen,’’ said Remillard. ‘‘Our program has been
spared what happens to many programs that have a large
freshman class. We have been blessed with freshmen who
are very talented and yet extremely respectful of the tra-
dition they are inheriting. They are certainly respectful of
upperclassmen, and I’ve been impressed with them.’

What had to be impressive was the way the Generals,
ranked fifth by the East Coast Water Polo Coaches Asso-
ciation, handled the sixth-ranked Black Knights of Army
during the four-team round-robin tournament. In the first
game between the two schools, W&L jumped out to a 2-0
lead after the first period and never looked back. Senior
co-captain David Reavy scored three goals, while class-
mate Moose Herring chipped in two in leading the Gen-
erals to a 8-6 victory.

During the weekend, the Generals (6-0) also defeated
Dayton by scores of 15-4 and 17-9 and earned a couple of

Both W&L soccer teams start season on solid ground |

wins over Lynchburg, downing the Hornets 13-10 and
11-5. These wins set up the championship game and re-
match with Army on Sunday afternoon.

This time around the Generals found themselves down a
goal, 8-7, late in the fourth period. No reason to worry.
With three minutes remaining, senior Martin Burlingame
knotted the score at 8-8. The senior co-captain Dave Dietz
gave the Generals the lead with his second goal of the
match with 2:18 showing.

Army had a man-up situation but the General defense
held and W&L took over offensively and called a timeout
with 1:38 left. Holding onto a slim one-goal edge, it was
time for maturity and leadership to step to the forefront.

“In a one-goal game, anything can happen,”’ said Re-
millard, whose team won the Southern League tournament
last season. **So, we need a goal to make sure the game is
over. We weren't going to hold onto the ball, we were go-
ing to try to score.

‘So Dietz is floating on the water like an otter and just
kind of says, ‘Hey, we're seniors. We've been here for
four years. Let’s go out and get the job done.’ It’s not what
he said, but how he said it.’’

The Generals got the job done, with Dietz scoring his
third goal of the game to secure a 10-8 win. Army was shu-
tout the entire fourth quarter by a swarming W&L defense.

This weekend the Generals will have to turn it up a notch
higher as they travel to Annapolis, Md. for the Southeast
Varsity Invitational, a tournament featuring the best polo
teams in the East. W&L will play Iona in the first round in
a game that is a must win for Remillard. If the Generals
advance past the first round, they will finish no lower than
fourth in the tourney.

“If we win our first game, we are in for three tough,
tough games,”” said Remillard. ‘‘That’s exciting. We need
to win that first game.”’

From Staff Reports

 

The 1988 soccer season could be a
special one for Washington and Lee
head coach Rolf Piranian and his Gen-
erals, and five special people could be
the reason.

This will be the last season for five
standout Generals, seniors Mike Ve-
liuona and Steve Udicious, the 1988
captains, and their classmates Harry
Halpert, Johnny Sarber and Jamie
Urso. Piranian calls the group the
‘*backbone‘* of the team.

‘Although we lost some pretty nice
kids last season, we’ve got some tre-
mendous veterans coming back,”’ Pir-
anian said. ‘‘We’ve got a very special
class of five seniors, all of whom have
been impact players throughout their
careers. I'd like to see this very tal-
ented group finish in style.’’

The team certainly finished its
season opener last Saturday against
Denison in style, sneaking out of

Granville, Ohio with a 2-1 overtime
victory. The Generals trailed most of
the way against the Big Red, but W&L
freshman David Hooker scored late to
send the game into overtime. Urso
showed his senior leadership, connect-
ing for the gamewinner in the extra
period. Sophomore David Gilmore
and junior Rick Silva each had an as-
sist for the Generals.

The win was the first step toward a
successful season, something the five
seniors will assuredly strive to ac-
complish. Sarber, who has scored 15
goals in his W&L career, and Urso,
who was fourth on the team in scoring
last season, will lead W&L’s for-
wards. Gilmore and Silva also will be
keys to the attack up front.

Backing up the forward line is a tal-
ented and productive midfield led by
Veliuona, junior returning _ starter
Scott Levitt and classmate Patrick
Brown, who led the team in scoring
last season and is tied for W&L’s all-
time assist lead with 15 in his career.

Veterans Udicious and Halpert lead
the group at defense, which also in-
cludes sophomore Duke Dilliard and
junior Jeff Caggiano. W&L will be

strong in goal, as junior Jaek Pringle, |

who recorded four shutouts last
season returns. Pringle and sopho-
more Jon Bull combined for the win in
goal over Denison with, each player
making 10 and three saves respec-
tively.

“It’s certainly good to start the
season with a win,’’ Piranian said.
**But we have a lot of work to do this
week. I think having a full week to
work on correcting our mistakes will
help us a lot.’’

W&L will play its home-opener
Sunday against Johns Hopkins at 1:30
pm. The Generals begin their Old
Dominion Athletic Conference sched-
ule on Wednesday at Roanoke.

“*My goals for the team are to have
a winning season and win the
ODAC,”’ Piranian said. ‘‘I think a
10-win season is a realistic goal.”’

Women rebound with 7-0 win over R-MWC

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Last year was a learning experience
for the Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team.

Playing its first season of varsity
competition, the Generals went 2-8-3
and finished fifth in the Old Dominion
Athletic Conference. More important
than the wins and losses, however,
was the opportunity for the team to
become accustomed to game condi-
tions and pressure situations.

That experience, especially from
the seniors who have been with the
program since it started out as a de-
velopmental team four years ago, has
definitely carried over into this year’s
campaign. After a tough 8-1 opening
game loss to an overpowering Den-
ison squad, the Generals rebounded
nicely with a 7-0 thrashing of Ran-
dolph-Macon Women’s College yes-
terday in Lexington.

“‘[The seniors] are very mature and
they are excellent leaders,’ said head

coach Jan Hathorn. ‘‘I think that’s
why we are so cohesive as a team. We
have a lot of fun because of it. They
certainly make my job easy, because
they are so capable, dependable, re-
liable and hard working. This is an ex-
tremely hard working group.”’

The Generals’ hard work was. not
enough to stop an excellent Denison
team on Saturday. W&L was able to
score only one goal, which came from
junior Catherine Baillio, last year’s
leading scorer.

The offense did not remain silent
against R-MWC. The Generals found
the back of the net four times in the
first ten minutes of play with Baillio
scoring twice and freshmen Ashley
Gray and Ann Shaughnessy adding a
goal apiece. Halftime score: W&L 4,
R-MWC 0.

“‘Every freshman is contributing,’’
said Hathorn. ‘‘Everyone of them is a
player. Everyone of them has experi-
ence.’’

The second half had been a trouble-
some one for the Generals a year ago,

Opening day is ugly |

,

something Hathorn attributed to as ‘a
lack of mental toughness and not as a
problem of conditioning. These prob-
lems were not present yesterday as
W&L continued to control the action
and keep the ball on R-MWC’s side of
the field. Freshman Elise Bryant,
senior Stephanie Lake and Shaughne-
ssy (her second goal of the afternoon)
scored for the Generals in the second
half. Hathorn sees the play of the
freshman as the cure to the second-
half blues. ’

**T think it will be better because the
freshman, first of all, are so strong,”’
she said. ‘‘I think it will make people
work, because if they don’t do it they
are going to be replaced.’’ :

The team will play host to the de-
fending ODAC champions in Roanoke
College on Saturday at 2:00 pm before
traveling to Ashland to play Ran-
dolph-Macon on Tuesday. Roanoke is
ranked No. 6 in the region in Division
ILI in the preseason. fC

“It’s going to be like playing a Det-
ison team again,’’ said Hathorn.

for Generals’ gridiron

W&L football’s opening-day dol-
drums continue.

Since 1955, the Generals are 11-22
in season openers. Since 1977, when
head coach Gary Fallon came to Lex-
ington, W&L is 3-8 in game one. And
the Generals haven’t won their season
opener since 1984,

But the Generals’ general lack of

success On opening day in recent years
may have more to do with the oppo-

nent — Emory & Henry six out of

seven times since 1982 — than the
calendar. In fact, Fallon jokingly
blames his poor record in season-
openers on W&L Athletic Director
and chief schedule-maker William
McHenry.

Whatever the reason, the streak
continued Saturday afternoon, when
Emory & Henry pounded the Generals
41-12 before a crowd of 3,300 at
W&L’s inaugural Hall of Fame game.

Things went well for Fallon early
on. W&L received the opening kick
off and drove 59 yards in 10 plays, in
cluding a 19-yard pass from junior
quarterback Phillip Sampson to soph
omore slotback Carl Gilbert and an
18-yard pass from Sampson to senior
split end Keith Boyd.

But all the air went out of the W&L
blimp when a Sampson handoff fell

into Emory & Henry hands. }Even
though the Wasps returned the favor
just three plays later with a fumble of
their own, W&L was stymied and for-
ced to settle for a 37-yard Carter
Quayle field goal. =

At the end of the first quarter, W&L
held a tenuous 3-0 lead, a lead that
would vanish two plays into the sec-
ond period when Emory & Henry tajl-
back Scotty Verran dove into the end
zone from a yard out. Kicker Morty
Guy added the extra point that put the
Wasps up 7-3. i

| ’

After three plays, W&L seniof Tom
Skeen came on to punt, and the Wasps
scored three plays later on a 61-yard
pass play. E&H backup QB Pat Walk-
er found split end Jon Lakey for’ a
61-yard gain and a 14-3 lead. .

W&L drove to the E&H 20, where
sophomore tailback Mason Pope was
caught for a 6-yard loss on. third
down. Quayle’s second field goal of
the day, a booming 42-yarder, made
the score 14-6. »

The Generals were heavily du-
tweighed by the Wasps on both frqnt
lines, and the Emory & Henry size
advantage became apparent on the
next drive. E&H drove 73 yards in gen
plays and scored on a l-yard run by
tailback Rodney Beville to take’ a
commanding 21-6 lead at halftime. ,

MIKE SHADY

After the Olympics,
money talks

Let’s play a game of word association. I'll give you a certain word
and you respond with the first word that comes to mind. Ready?

money—cash
cash—W&L
W&L—conservative
conservative—Bush
Bush—beer
beer—AMiller Lite
Miller Lite—athletes
athletes—Olympics
Olympics—money

Yes, the Olympics are cranking up this weekend and that means
money—big bucks, no whammies—for several of those Americans in-
volved in the activities.

Wait a minute! I thought the Olympics are for amateurs only. What’s
all this talk about money?

Well, it’s not like the athletes will be competing for cash directly, but,
in most sports, an individual’s performance could indirectly lead to fu-
ture dividends. We're talking endorsements. Major endorsements.
Bruce (Wheaties) Jenner does not have to pick up a pinkie for the rest of
his natural life because of the way he marketed himself after winning the
decathlon gold in Montreal. Neither does Mary Lou Retton.

Other winners will use their Olympic experience to launch profes-
sional careers. While track and field athletes are already professionals,
others like boxers, gymnasts, basketball, baseball and volleyball players
as well as the equestrian riders will turn Olympic gold into a chance to
earn lots of green. In boxing, for instance, a gold medal can mean six
figures in prize moolah for their first professional fight. Being on the
Olympic basketball team assures a signing bonus of at least $500,000 on
a NBA club.

Enough, you say! Bring back the ‘‘good old days’’ when men were
men and athletes competed because they loved competing. Why did it
change?

I don’t think it has changed. We get so caught up in this romantic idea
that athletes should be strong of body and pure of mind. If the opportun-
ity presents itself, why can’t an athlete take advantage of it? What’s
he/she supposed to do? Refuse the money?

For most of the individuals at Seoul, the games will be the realization
of the athletic dream. For others, it will be the realization of a financial
dream, as well.

NOTES —Once again my fall is ruined by the New York Mets. Has
there ever been a team, besides the Boston Celtics, that is just universal-
ly hated except by those who live in the New York area? It won’t matter
anyway. Look for the Oakland A’s to beat the ‘“‘Oughta be’s’’ in six
games in the Series... Hats off to the W&L water polo team. This team
has a chance to become the first ever Division II squad to make the
NCAA water polo championships..... Finally, a warm welcome goes
out to our new Sports Information Director Mike (Sid) Stachura. I’m
sure Stach will do an excellent job and it is great to be working with such

In a lot of ways, the 1988 Washing-
ton and Lee women’s volleyball team
looks like a first-year sport. For in-
stance, this season will be W&L’s
first season to compete for the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference cham-
pionship in volleyball. The season will
be filled with plenty of firsts for the
record books, as well.

But all those first-year sport looks
can be deceiving. At least, that’s what
head coach Susan Dittman hopes.

The women will enter their first
ODAC season as almost everything
but inexperienced. Two years of toil-
ing away in relative obscurity as a de-

“I’m really encouraged about how
the year looks,’’ said Dittman, who
has guided the team for the past two
years as a developmental sport. ‘‘I
think we’ ll be able to stay on the court
with everybody and hold our own pre-
tty well. I think we have come a long
ways in two years.”’

 

Opener

 

(Continued from page 6

The third quarter saw E&H use its
size advantage and a powerful running
game to build a 35-6 lead. After an
exchange of punts, Emory & Henry’s
Verran went to work and picked up 37
yards on seven carries, including a
3-yard touchdown run that Gave the
Wasps a 28-6 lead.

W&L had the ball for only one play
before junior fullback Russell Crosby
fumbled at his own 28. Six plays later,
the Wasps were in the end zone and
completely in command, 35-6.

Both teams emptied their benches in
the fourth quarter, and the play of
W&L’s backups was one of the after-
noon’s few bright spots for the Gen-
erals.

velopmental sport have paid dividends
that could be cashed in as soon as this
season.

**At the bare minimum, I would like
to see us make the ODAC tourna-
ment,’’ said Dittman of the season-
ending conference tourney, for which
the top eight ODAC teams qualify.
‘*The team has set a personal goal of
finishing at least slightly above .500,
as well.

**And I think we can do it if we
work hard and the team gels.’’

Many positives point to the squad
doing just that. In addition to having
everyone return from last year’s
group, a fine crop of freshmen should
contribute, also, Dittman said. Of the
returning upperclassmen, three key
players will be seniors Vanessa Hart-
man and Melissa Thrasher, who were
co-captains last year, and sophomore
Melissa Jay, who quarterbacks the
W&L attack and was named the
team’s most valuable player last
season.

The team should feature a healthy
mix of seniors and experienced

“I was really pleased with their en-
thusiasm and hustle,’’ said Fallon.
‘*When they were in there, they were
giving their best.’’

Junior quarterback Chris Smythe
scored the Generals’ only touchdown
of the game after leading a 57-yard
drive that included impressive running
by sophomore fullback Kirk Sohon-
age.

HASHMARKS— Sampson fin-
ished with 8-of-14 passing for 119
yards and one interception. Smythe
completed five of six passes for 61
yards and also rushed for 18 yards on
four carries.... W&L receiving: Boyd
caught five passes for 70 yards, Pope
four for 53 yards.... Crosby carried
10 times for 51 yards, and Sohonage
rushed five times for 32 yards.... The
Generals take a week off before
traveling to Centre College on Sept.
24.

Women’s volleyball set for first varsity year

younger players, Dittman said.

‘*The seniors are in the unique posi-
tion of this being their first and last
season, so they will be the ones push-
ing the others and keeping the inten-
sity up,’” she said.

Dittman is encouraged by last win-
ter’s scrimmages, which saw W&L go
4-3 against conference opponents.
More of the same success could be in
store this fall. The Generals opened
their season Tuesday night with
scrimmages against Eastern Mennon-

ite and Bridgewater. The season gets
into full swing with the Randolph
Macon Woman’s College Tournament
this weekend.

“I expect we'll be competitive and
play good power volleyball,’’ said
Dittman. ‘‘We have some people who
can do a lot of things and that has
opened up a lot of options. Now, it’s a
matter of figuring out how to use them
and getting them on court in the right
places. I think we can be real success
ful.””

‘88 Summer Hot for movies

 

By Michael Tuggle

Entertainment Editor

 

Well, I must say that this summer
was exemplary for good movies. In
fact, it was the best summer for films
since E.T. and company hit the sum-
mer scene in 1982. As always, there
was a plethora of sequels, the majority
of which were incredibly poor, but for
the most part the summer was excel-
lent for good films and high ticket
sales

Many of the heralded films released
toward the end of the summer such as
‘*Married to the Mob,”’ ‘‘Running on
Empty,’’ ‘Eight Men Out’’ and
‘*Midnight Run"’ are not included in
the following analysis of my Top Ten
Summer Movies because I never got a
chance to see them. However, having
seen the majority of the worthwhile
films for summer 1988, here are my
choices for the Top Ten films of the
summer.

10. The Presidio

Good cops and robbers flick. Nice
to see people still smuggle things like
diamonds instead of only drugs. Good
plot and tie together at the end. A little
predictable but not a bad flick. Sean
Connery is wonderful as always and
Meg Ryan is hotter than ever.

9. Crocodile Dundee II

At least as good as the first if not
better. Again there are priceless
scenes such as the snake killing in the
department store, and the scene with
Dundee’s aborigine friends. ‘‘Do we
really get to eat them?’’is priceless.
Hogan is still just as refreshing in the
lead as he was when he first began the
role a few years ago. The end is a little
predictable but it doesn’t hurt this
film; the one sequel that delivered this
summer.

8. Young Guns

The film is very well done cinema-
tically and is perfectly cast but does
tend to drag a little in places. Its nice

to see a decent western for a change
but don’t count on this film bringing
the western back as a_ substantial
genre. The strength of this film lies
not with its subject matter but with its
young stars. Charlie Sheen, Emilio
Estevez and Casey Siemaszko are
adequate but it is Kieffer Sutherland,
Dermot Mulroney and Lou Diamond
Phillips who steal the show. Phillips
scene describing the slaughter of his
reservation is especially powerful.

7. Cocktail

I’m going against the critics on this
one. I thought the film was quite en-
joyable and that the performances
were excellent. Tom Cruise continues
to improve with each film as does El-
isabeth Shue. Bryan Brown gives the
best performance he’s given since
‘‘Breaker Morant.’’ Think about the
film in terms of the cliche *‘Money
isn’t everything’? and you may find
that the film says more than you
thought it did.

6. Bull Durham

The beginning drags and the end
races but overall this is an excellent
character study. It’s not bust out
funny, but it is quite humorous in all
the right places. Good character de-
velopment is really what the film is all
about. While the film is all right, the
three main characters are fantastic.
Costner’s ‘‘I believe in the small of a
woman's back, the hanging curveball,
high fiber, good scotch, long fore-
play, that there ought to be a constitu-
tional amendment outlawing astro-turf
and the designated hitter, the ‘‘sweet
spot‘t, chocolate chip cookies and
long, slow, soft, deep, wet kisses that
last three days’’ line is a classic.

5. Coming to America

Cute story and great versatile acting
from Arsenio Hall and Eddie Murphy
to make the film work. Great tie in to
‘*Trading Places’’ with Don Ameche
and Ralph Bellamy. Murphy’s charac-
terizations of the men in the barber

4. A Fish Called Wanda

If you don’t enjoy Monty Python
and/or can’t appreciate the dry wit of
British humor then going to see this
film would be a waste of your time
and money. However, those of you
with open minds should find this film
utterly hilarious. John Cleese and Mi-
chael Palin, the braintrusts of Britain’s
Monty Python, are again together and
are funnier than ever. The film is per-
fectly cast with Jamie Lee Curtis and
Kevin Kline in the other leads and is
acted beautifully. This is definitely a
film you will want to see again.

3. Big

Definitely one of the best movies of
the summer. Even though the film
dragged a touch in places, overall it
was done very well. The scenes in
FAO Schwartz were wonderful. Tom
Hanks is incredible as the 13-year-old
and again shows us what absolute bril-
liance his talent holds. He has every-
thing about a 13-year- old down to a
T. After so many failures using the
same premise, it is refreshing and sat-
isfying to know that there is a director
out there who can make this film and
not screw it up. Bravo, Penny Mar-
shall.

summer. (At least the guys are asking
that.) The reason is, because ‘‘Die
Hard’’ a great flick. It’s no major
cinematic achievement or anything.
It’s just highly entertaining. Willis is
not in my opinion a comic genius or a
fantastic actor. However, if he can
stick to roles such as the one he plays
in this off to the races, never ending
cops and terrorists film, then he has a
place to work in Hollywood. This film
takes off and never slows down. The
acting is quite good as are the special
effects. If you missed this film, go
back and find it.

1. Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
Definitely lives up to all the hype its
been getting as the best film of the
summer and one of the best of the
year. The combination of the live ac-
tion with the animation is absolutely
incredible and has never had an equal.
This film will win the 1989 Academy
Award for Visual Effects hands down.
Hoskins is perfect having to act his en-
tire part off of nothing but air. Watch
for him to be nominated for Best
Actor when the Academy Award
nominations are announced in March.
Bringing the Warner Bros. and Disney
cartoons together for the first time is
definitely a coup. All the major char-
acters from both studios appear in the
film with the exceptions of Felix the
Cat and Popeye whose owners
wouldn’t accept the $5000 rental from
the director. That in itself is worth
some type of award. The film is won-
derful from the superb opening scene
up until the final one. See this film
more than once and watch and listen
for little things. You'll pick up some-

thing new each time you see it.
