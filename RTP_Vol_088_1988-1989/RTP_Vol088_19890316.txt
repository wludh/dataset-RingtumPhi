Scott McArron was on the panel

and could speak for his fraternity.
There was only a brief debate

on reverse discrimination: — the
effectivness and need for
affirmative action programs in

minority contracting firms which
was sparked by the recent Supreme
Court decision to impose new tests
on “‘set-asides’’ for minority
contracting firms.

Most of the forum time
focused on the equality of black

organizations, especially fraternities,
at W&L.

The audience of 20 students

and faculty members were

permitted to state their views on
black opportunities in fraternities
on campus after being called on by
the forum mediator, Christopher
deMovellan.

Sophomore Damon Sanders
said that all fraternities are open to
everyone in theory, yet there are a
number of fraternities that have the
reputation of not admitting blacks,
and thus are not truly open to
blacks.

Panel member Mary Alice
McMorrow, a junior dorm
counselor, cited incidents of black
freshmen being treated well during
the early stages of rush at certain

fraternities in order to give the
appearance of being open to
blacks, when in fact, later in the
process, the black rushees were not
considered for bids.

Freshman class President Willie
Henderson reiterated this feeling
that black freshman were led along
by certain fraternities simply for
appearances sake, when in fact
they were never considered as
candidates for bids.

Panel member Scott Jackson,
manager of the MSA house, also
agreed with Henderson and cited
Kappa Alpha as one of the
offenders.

KA was continually referred
to during the discussion as one of

Tomorrow is March 17th.
Those who have an_ intimate

relationship with their calendars
will realize that this is St. Patrick’s
Day. Tomorrow adults around the
world will drink green beer and
make merry.

There will also be a few select
children scarred for life because
they have worn the wrong color to
school. (These same children’s

The tradition, however, runs much
deeper.

St. Patrick, the patron saint of
Ireland, was born in Scotland in
387. When he was 16 he was
captured by Irish raiders, then sold
as a slave to a high priest. He
served the priest for six years
and learned the Celtic language.
When he was able to escape from
his master, he fled to the west
coast of Ireland. There he boarded
a ship and landed in Britain a few
days later. He devoted himself to

Pledgeship tests fraternity loyalty

 

By Allen Litvak
Staff Reporter

 

Fraternity initiation week
represents the culmination of
pledgeship. At the end of this
week the pledges are initiated and
enjoy all the rights. of being a
fraternity brother.

This week is the last chance for
the fraternity to test the pledge
class’ ability to unify and to
demonstrate their fraternal loyalty.

For example, last year’s Fiji
pledge class shaved their heads
during initiation week. Tyler
Suiters, a member of that pledge
class, said, ‘‘It was our own idea.
We got mohawks to show unity
and loyalty to the house. Actually,
eight out of 17 got mohawks, and
the other nine got flat-tops.”’

This year fraternities are using
a new pledge program in which
the freshmen rush and accept bids

in the fall but do not begin
pledgeship until January.
Leroy C. ‘*Buddy’’ Atkins,

dean of Greek affairs, said that all
fraternities must initiate by March

25th under this new program.

When questioned about what
concerned him most about
initiation week, Atkins replied,

“‘There may be some houses that
are doing things that are physically
dangerous, like sleep deprivation or
abuse of alcohol. According to the
pledge programs, none of these
things are happening, but what’s
down on paper can be different
from what’s really happening.”’

Atkins also said, ‘Basically,
people conceal from me _ what’s
going on.’

Nonetheless, some rites of
initiation week are demonstrated in
public, such as pledges carrying
boxes or bricks. Atkins described
these public displays as
“‘borderline hazing.”’

Ross Singletary, president of the
IFC, said he was asked about the
consequences of a fraternity being
brought up on charges of sleep
deprivation or alcohol abuse. He
said, ‘‘Both fypothetical charges
are serious violations, and
depending upon the severity, we
would hand down some
punishment. This punishment

would have to be hammered out in
an IFC meeting since there is no

precedent to go by.’’ As far as
this year’s __initiation’s week,
Singletary said, ‘‘To my

knowledge everything is going
fine.””

While some fraternities are in
the midst of their initiation weeks
and other fraternities have yet to
begin, Lambda Chi Alpha initiated
their freshmen Feb. 24. Lambda
Chi President Dirk van Assendelft
said, ‘‘We don’t have pledges, we
have social members. They get
almost full brother rights, right
from the beginning.” van
Assendelft explained Lambda Chi’s

early initiation, saying, “‘We felt,

like seven weeks later they were
ready to become initiated.’’

On the opposite end of the
spectrum, John Stump is a
sophomore pledge who completed
a pledge program last year, only to
pledge a different house this year.
When Stump was asked why he
waited until after initiation week to
depledge he said, ‘I decided to

the houses on campus that, as
Jackson later said, have the image
of being discriminatory toward
blacks, whether or not it is true of
the fraternity members. KA was
singled out largely, as deMovellan
made clear, because the other
fraternities in question were not
represented at the discussion, and
could not defend themselves.

KA’s annual ‘‘Old South’
ball and the fraternity’s Southern
tradition were pointed out as
factors in KA’s categorization as
one of the fraternities on campus
that has a reputation for being
prejudiced toward blacks.

McArron assured the panel and

shamrock (or a little bit of green)
commemorates how St. Patrick

the Irish. He said the three leaves

So with this in mind, everyone
can now go out and have fun

considerate and remember _ that
thousands of people are seriously
injured every year from senseless

Pizza smuggling going on

 

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

 

As if there weren’t enough
justification already, add the fact
that they can’t legally get
Domino’s pizza at VMI to the list
of reasons why you should be
thankful you are here at W&L
instead of behind the gray walls.

Domino’s corporation celebrated
March as ‘‘National Nutrition
Month’’ by mailing out pamphlets
extolling the virtues of (surprise,
surprise) pizza as a ‘‘well-balanced
meal.’’

Although Domino’s will be
opening its 5,000th store this
spring, it’s a safe bet that it will

not resemble the one located here
in Lexington. Described by
manager Rush Earman as ‘‘the

Twilight Zone’’ because ‘‘we do
things different,’’ this store is
involved in such diverse endeavors
as a clandestine pizza smuggling
operation, support of the W&L arts
and battling the efforts of crafty
pizza bandits operating out of (say
it ain’t so) Washington and Lee.

The local franchise lives by the
motto ‘‘Necessity is the mother of
invention,’ according to Earman.
He said that, while the store has
no current plans to repeat the
‘‘pizza_wars’’- contests between
fraternities to order the largest
number of pizzas run earlier in the

decade he would ‘‘entertain§ the
idea, because it seems pretty
interesting.”’

He said he would have to look
back at the past history of the
‘‘nizza wars’? promotion, since it
was run before he began working
there. Earman explained that while
Domino’s works’ with _ the

fraternities at the University of
Virginia, he would have to ‘“‘go
through =the proper — channels’’

consulting his supervisors before
approving such an endeavor.

Domino’s does run promotions
in conjunction with W&L,
however. The pizza company paid
for the printing of the tickets for
the University Theatre with a
coupon printed on the back of the
ticket and helped sponsor the
recent lip-synch contest.

But the store’s most interesting
area enterprise is, undoubtedly, the
underground pizza railroad it runs
to the cadets at VMI. Although
cadets are officially forbidden from
ordering pizza there, a few of the
bravest and hardiest souls do sc
anyway, rebelling against — the
system with Domino’s help.

Earman explained the details of
this sordid business. ‘‘We sneak it
in to them. They are not allowed
to order pizza, but they do and we
deliver. We have to sneak it in or
meet them at special places.’’

While there is no penalty for
Domino’s drivers caught on VMI’s
campus, any cadet apprehended
with a pizza in hand must pay for
his transgression with the novel
penalty of extra marching.

Surprisingly, at a university
where the honor code is such a
revered convention, W&L siudents
still heist pizzas from the luckless
delivery-men.

Earman said, ‘“‘They will raid
the driver’s vehicle after he goes
into the building. It usually

audience that KA does not make a
conscious effort to be prejudiced.
In defense of the ‘‘Old South’

must understand the history of KA,
The fraternity’s first chapter was
established at W&L, which did not
admit blacks until the 1960s.

The ball itself, he said, is a
matter of tradition, not of
prejudice.

In response to questions about
the absence of blacks in_ his
fraternity, McArron said that, in
the time he has been at W&L,
racial issues have never been
brought up with regard to a black

to EC

Campaign posters will stay up
as the attention shifts from last
week’s elections for EC officers to
next week’s elections for class
officers and EC representatives.

Jon Sheinberg was elected EC
secretary in the runoff election held
last Thursday. Sheinberg collected
473 votes, 20 more votes than his
opponent Mike Meers.

Sheinberg said he wants to
introduce the Honor System to
freshmen in a less threatening
manner than has been done in the
past. He also said he wants to
maintain the current status of
student government authority over
student life.

Election day procedures were

questioned by Meers. He said
choosing Thursdays for runoff
elections leads to low voter
turnouts. He also said the number
of ballot boxes should be
increased.

“There’s one ballot box for
every 800 undergraduates and the
law school gets one for every
300,’ said Meers. Although he
said election procedures may not
have caused his defeat, he
suggested that Thursday runoffs
and the accessibility of ballot
boxes should be examined.

1989-90 class presidents, vice
presidents and EC rep elections
will be held Monday with runoffs
on Thursday. Students can vote
from 9 to 5, at the ODK circle,
the Library and the Gilliam Dorm
quad.

The role of presidents and vice
presidents as Student Conduct
Committee (SCC) representatives is
being emphasized in this year’s
elections.

SCC Chairman and senior class
President David Burns, “‘The class

Censorship in

The University of Virginia has seen better days. As The

UVa student council “‘has joined the Campus Crusade for
Liberal Intolerance by censoring the only conservative

publication in Charlottesville.’

In a situation even more serious than the action taken by

Why? According to UVa’s appropriations committee, the
magazine has become ‘‘political’’ and is therefore no longer
entitled to funding. Problem: at the same board meeting at
which the Advocate lost its support, several liberal campus
publications had their funding approved, including one that

recently called the CIA an

‘‘outlaw organization’ and

another that said North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms has
written a book titled ‘‘Why I Like White People.’’ Clearly,
UVa’s appropriations committee has found it convenient to

apply two sets of rules.

We commend our colleagues at The Cavalier Daily for

supporting the Advocate

and observing that the

appropriations committee’s standards for funding ‘‘are being
applied politically.’’ And we hope the Journal was right in
saying that Virginians won’t allow this censorship to
continue. ‘‘The state’s taxpayers no doubt more revere their
state’s contribution to Jeffersonian democracy than to liberal
academia’s new double standard.”’

Vote to restore
student power

 

._MY VIEW
By Ann Gregory

The issue of the day at Wash-
ington and Lee is the problem of
student power. We feel that we
have none, or that what we did
have has slowly been siphoned off
’~by the administration. Examples
would included the formation of
‘the Confidential Review Committee
and the creation of the Fraternity
“Renaissance Program. The. probl-

 

--em having been stated and ackno-:

wledged by everyone, let’s do
something about it; let’s bring po-
‘wer back to the students.

We as students are not going
simply to be handed responsibility
by the administration. Rather, we
have to eam it, to deserve it.
Apparently, this was an issue in
the Executive Committee Big
Three elections. But it is more
‘important now that Student
Conduct Committee/class office
elections are approaching. I agree
- -with the Executive Committee that
the class officers’ role as SCC
representative is more important
than, and should be considered
‘before, the specific leadership of
. the class. We should not resign
ourselves to electing party planners
and social organizers. Rather, we
need to consider the role of the
.SCC and its representatives.

- The Student Conduct Committee
hears cases of student misconduct
_ fot covered by the Honor Code.
These cases formerly included
sexual assault and _ racial
aggression. However, these cases
are now being reviewed by the

CRC. The problem, to the best of
my knowledge, was confidentiality
and the makeup of the committee.
If you were on either side of a
sexual assault case, for example,
would you feel comfortable ex-
plaining your situation to a group
of guys who were not prohibited
from discussing the case with
anyone outside the committee? Of
course not. You might not even
have a way of predicting what
kind of verdict and sentence the
committee would hand down. This
is not! the ‘way to handle sensitive
problems on campus.

If we are in favor of student
power, as I know we are, we need
to support student leadership and
responsibility. I am in favor of
strict adherence by the SCC to its
new confidentiality clause, and a
redefinition of its role on campus
vis a vis the CRC and the EC. A
program should be instituted
whereby SCC members are trained
in the effects of misconduct and
violence by the  university’s
professional counseling staff. I
think all students should make it
their responsibility to understand
how student government works,
and that officers should show their
classmates how to make it work
for them. Class officers should
take a look at their roles as
leaders, supporting those activities
in which their classmates take part
and promoting that ever elusive
goal of class unity. Most
importantly, however, I think the
best way for us to show how much
we deserve power is to get out and
vote for SCC and &C
representatives on March 20.

Discrimination:

 

MY VIEW
By Tina Vandersteel

**Washington and Lee fraternities racially
discriminate! Something has to be done!”’

That basically covers the main points made
at panel dicussion cosponsored by the
Minority Student Association and Omicron
Delta Kappa last week. Everyone in the
audience and on the six-member panel agreed,
after an hour and-a-half, that racial
discrimination does occur, even if not on a
house-wide basis. The question then turned to
what to do to stop it. During this time it was
rather pedantically assumed that racial
discrimination is evil.

I want to examine this assumption.

The question is not do fraternity houses
practice racial discrimination. The question
Ought to be: should fraternities be allowed to
practice racial discrimination.

First let us examine discrimination.
Discrimination is a practice that comes about
because of prejudice. What is prejudice?
Syndicated columnist Walter Williams (who,
incidentally, is black) gives an_ interesting
definition of prejudice having to do with
limiting information costs.

Williams says that a non-discriminatory

 

person would put no value on_ information .

costs, and, therefore would seek to find out all
information before making a decision.

Williams uses the following example: What
if I were to walk outside and be greeted by a
Bengal tiger? I, being a discriminatory person
and knowing what I know about Bengal tigers
(that is, how they tend to be carnivorous,
big-toothed aggressors), I would immediately
run the other direction. My past information
has stereotyped this tiger so that I assume it
is like all other tigers, clearly an unfair
assumption.

If, however, I was a completely
non-discriminatory person, before making the
decision to run, I would first seek to gather
more information about this particular tiger.
Perhaps I would walk up to him and try to
pet him to see if he is really like other tigers.

Chances are I will be bitten. Clearly, in
this instance, discriminating against the tiger

would be to my advantage, even if it is unfair
to this tiger.

Now let’s look at it from the tiger’s point
of view. The tiger is also discriminating. If he
is hungry and sees a human in front of him,
he may decide, based on past experience, that
he wants or does not want to eat me. I, in
essence, will have been stereotyped by the
tiger as edible or not.

So, what does all this have to do with
fraternities at Washington and Lee?
Stereotypes that the rushors and the rushees
make are, in effect, discriminatory practices.

When I got to W&L, ‘“‘dirty rush’’ did not
apply to women. Any person could say
anything he or she wanted to a woman about

Fraternities that racially
discriminate are losing out
on fine students. Their right
to do so, however, is
unquestionable.

 

what fraternities were like. So, I learned that
X, Y, and Z were ‘‘geek houses’’ and not to
go to them. I learned that A, B, and C were
“southern houses’” and, being from (I almost
hate to admit it) New Jersey, not to go to
them. :
~eeSo I, as a ‘“‘rushee,’’ limited the houses to

g0-'-to. during - tush, thus limiting my’

information costs. As it turned out, J now
have friends in X, Y, Z and A, B, C, so the
‘dirty rush’’ advice was overcome in the end.
Not making friends at these houses
immediately did not really hurt me, and it did
help me decide what rush parties to attend (it
limited my information costs), so I can say
that my discrimination paid off.

But what about the rushors? They have to
limit the amount of people they rush, and so
they have to have criteria for evaluating the
freshmen, too. Here I like to make certain
assumptions about the nature of Washington
and Lee freshmen.

By virtue of their having being admitted
into the university, W&L freshmen must
possess a certain amount of intelligence.
After going through the E.C.’s honor lecture
during orientation, one could say they possess

\

«

Their right, their loss Hf

a certain respect for honor and W&L tradition. -

Knowing these things, by what standards

ought the fraternities evaluate students going ~

through rush?

be detected, anyway.

Well, let’s start with sex. Fraternities
discriminate against women. No one questions
their right to do so. What if we women stood
up and demanded equal access to fraternities?
People would think we were crazy. Instead,
we start sororities and eventually we will
make certain claims about how wonderful they

are, making them attractive for future women ,

to join.

How about region? I can name a few
houses that pride themselves on being
“‘southern.”’ Southern tradition is built into the
history of these fratemitics, in fact. So,
northern people don’t bother rushing southern
houses, and southern houses don’t bother
rushing northern freshmen.

Notice where this process could lead.
Southem houses could be losing out on
valuable scholars or athletes or genuinely fine
people. This is a chance those houses are
willing to take in the effort to have an
efficient rush.

Another criterion: social interaction. This
is the all-important being-able-to-work-your-
way-into-a-conversation-gracefully-and-not-be-
left-  standing-in-a-corner dilemma. Maybe
those people who prefer to stand in a corner
have a certain individualistic qualities that the
fraternity will lose out on by not extending
that person a bid.

So, what about race? Is it ‘‘fair’’ to limit
one’s information costs simply by the color of
one’s skin? I would say it is ‘‘fair,’’ but not
profitable. Fraternity houses are private clubs.
They may, and they do, discriminate on
whatever basis they like.

It is my opinion that fraternities that
racially discriminate are losing out on fine
students. To me, the cost of discrimination
on this basis is too high. Perhaps it would be
appropriate for them to examine why they
discriminate against blacks (do they blindly
accept stereotypes, or do they form their own
opinions from personal experience) before
doing so. Their right to do so, however, is in
my mind unquestionable.

By Charles Gay

Self-righteousness is a disease
which afflicts all of us to a greater
or lesser degree. Regardless of
whether or not we choose to
express ourselves, everyone
possesses an opinion on something
and it is human nature for us to
believe that we are right and those
who oppose our views are wrong.

We all feel free to act on our
opinions at some point, be it by
voting, donating money to a cause,
or even writing this column.

Ignorance is the enemy of
everyone who formulates opinions
on anything, and is the chief
contributor to self-righteousness.
An opinion infected by ignorance
is harmless until acted on, when it
can become a_ source of
embarrassment or worse, when
confronted with one more firmly
based in fact.

While watching TV with some
friends recently, I was bemoaning
the extensive amount of reading
awaiting me in a book on Irish
history. Regrettably, in my
indignation a mild denunciation of
Ireland. as a whole slipped out of
my mouth. A fraternity brother’s
girlfriend then commented that she
had once donated a sum of money
to the Irish Republican Army.
Fresh from my readings and fairly
knowledgeable about the current
organization, 1 asked her why, to
which she replied, ‘*Because it’s
{meaning British-held Northern
Ireland] theirs [Ireland’s].’’ This
commonly-held misconception
accounts for the reason that the
IRA receives so much funding

 

from Irish-Americans.

The ostensible reason for the
existence of the IRA stems from
conflict over the partition of the
Emerald Isle in 1921, which left
six of her northern counties in the
United Kingdom while the rest
became the independent Free State.
The British government of David
Lloyd George arrived at this
solution after Anglo-Irish guerilla
warfare had reached a fever pitch
following World War I. A leading
force in this partisan war on the

The IRA _ that currently
terrorizes the British Isles (and
occasionally elsewhere) merits no
one’s money, much less an
American’s. Its most recent
incarnation, which cropped up in
the 1960s, demands an end to the
partition of the island, and the
return of Northern Ireland to unity
with the southern Irish government.
The partition, however, was not an
arbitrary event; it reflected a desire
of the majority of the inhabitants
of six counties to remain in union

 

Ignorance is the enemy of everyone

ignorance can transform tainted opinions
into a regrettable gesture.

 

Irish side was a_ para-military
group known as the Irish
Republican Army. Although the
organization committed numerous
brutal murders (sometimes of
innocent civilian), a case can be
made that it was a_ legitimate
freedom fighting group in an
oppressed land. The establishment
of an independent Ireland put forth
the image of a romanticized, heroic
movement in the eyes of an Irish
people inured to a violent national
tradition. Included were _Irish-
Americans who  nostalgically
viewed the struggle from abroad.
This lingering perception shapes

with Britain, for economic and
political reasons. Chiefly, the
area’s industries were tied closely
to the U.K., while the Protestant
majority feared domination by the
Catholic south. Of course, no
partition enacted could be a perfect
one, but the British government did
see fit to allow three of the area's
sister counties (together the nine
make up Ulster, a historic unit) to
join the new free Ireland in 1921.
The inhabitants of Northern
Ireland, though Protestant, are as
Irish as anyone else, having lived
there for 350 years.

‘Because it’s theirs?’’ I don’t
think so.

The catalogue of IRA violence
since the 1960s is so vast that it
defies any kind of summary in this

space. Generally, an IRA strike
involves the murder of a couple of
British soldiers in Northern Ireland
or even England. Not infrequently,
though, the targets are or become
civilian. The IRA is by no means
unfamiliar with the killing of
innocent people, sometimes even
the Irish Catholics they are
supposedly fighting for.

Just last July, an IRA bomb
blast killed an  unoffending
Northern Irish couple and their six-
year-old son by accident. IRA
official Danny Morrison issued an
apology for the tragedy, which
certainly did the slain family a lot
of good. According to The New
York Times, at least 17 people
were mistakenly killed by the IRA
between November 1987 and
August 1988, including several
Roman Catholics.

Another IRA act of patriotic
freedom fighting in recent memory
was the December 1983 bombing
of Harrod’s, a London department
store. The blast killed five and
wounded 90, mostly shoppers.
Certainly, in part, the IRA scrves
as a convenient cloak for personal
grudges and the naturally violent.
Whatever their motivations, the
IRA is busy killing civilians with
bombs paid for in part by ill-
informed Americans.

The IRA would be committing
atrocities without American
donations, to be sure. And it is
certainly nice to hear that some
people care about their beliefs
enough to act on them in some
way. It is only when they don’t
really know what they believe or
why they believe it that actions
transform a tainted opinion into a
regrettable gesture.

Minorities visit W&L campus

 

By Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

Minority students joined the
prospectives’ invasion of the
Washington and Lee campus today
as they were flown in for Minority
Student Visitation Weekend to
attend classes, interviews, and
experience the social scene at the
university.

One of the main events for the
minority recruits will be a panel
discussion featuring successful
alumni of W&L. The panel
includes a senior attomey general,
an attorney, a president of a
company, an accountant, and a vice
president of a bank.

William Grafton Young,

assistant director of admissions,
hopes to show the minority
prospectives that there is plenty of
opportunity for them at W&L.

“If you come here with a goal
in mind, you can be successful.
You can use the foundation

materials you gain from W&L to
be more successful in life,” said
Young.

He is proud to be able to tell
minority prospectives that W&L
students have elected minorities to
serve on the Executive Council and
as class officer.

Young wants to expose the
prospectives to all aspects of the
university’s environment. “We
want them to see with their eyes
wide open, knowing there is a very
small minority at this school.”’

The University of Maryland recently
announced that it will enforce its Code of
Academic Integrity in hopes of alleviating
problems with student dishonesty.

The president of UMD recently approved
an honor code, which is now being reviewed
by the UMD Board of Regents. Maryland’s
honor code will differ greatly from the W&L
Honor System.

When a Maryland student is caught
cheating academically, an XF will be placed
on their transcript to show that the student
committed academic fraud. The student has
the opportunity to participate in a six week
morality seminar, where white collar crime
and academic dishonesty cases will be
discussed,

According to Gary Pevela, College Park’s
director of judicial programs, one year after
the violation and after successful completion
of the morality seminar, the student can
petition the Honor Council to have the XF

The Honor Council, which will have a
student majority until its review in 1992, will
have the sole authority to remove the XF
from student transcripts. This will be the
only institution where students can make
changes on other students’ transcripts, said
Pavela.

UMD chose to place a mark indicating
academic fraud on the transcript rather than
automatically expelling a student, as W&L
does.

Pavela said, ‘“These are young people
whose values are being formed. The first-
time offender’s character is not set in stone
and we think it can be changed.

“‘We are keeping the role of proctoring
because of a much larger school body and a
non-residential location. We are making
academic integrity the joint responsibility of
students and faculty.”’

Joseph Fanning, a UMD freshman, said
that an Academic Integrity Code is a great
idea because ‘‘people shouldn’t be cheating.’’
He said there was already a phone number

listed in all test books for people to call
anonymously to report cheating.

According to W&L Executive Committee
President Christopher de Movellan, W&L has
not considered a system like that of the
University of Maryland.

“‘W&L is a school that, since Lee, has
prided itself on an individual’s autonomy and
the ability to make important decisions about
everything. With that autonomy comes great
responsibility and if the responsibilities aren’t
upheld then you bring certain penalties upon
yourself,

“A practical reason (that W&L would not
follow UMD’s example) is that our honor

system covers much more than the academic
realm,”’

Alston Parker, an EC member, agreed with
de Movellan. She said, ‘‘The University of

Maryland is inviting people to cheat. You
can cheat 10 times and if you get caught
once, then you go to a morality seminar. It’s
saying it’s okay to cheat until you get caught.
The philosophy of the W&L Honor System is
that you don’t measure honor in degrees.”’

This Saturday morning at 9
a.m. trout season opens.

Thousands of fishermen across
the state will crowd the banks of
local streams in search of the
elusive trout. Virginia has stocked
315,000 of them so far this year so
the fisherman will be excited to
begin.

Although some will set up their
lounge chair and cooler the night
before, most will arrive shortly
after daybreak to jockey for the
best spots. The good holes will be
completely surrounded by anglers
armed with cans of corn and tiny
jars of artificially colored salmon
eggs in various hues from yellow
to purple.

Inevitably, several lines will get
crossed right at the opening gun as
a dozen or so people try to get
their fuschia colored marshmallow
down to the trout first.

If you don’t have anything to
do, then go check it out--it is ‘‘All
American,”’ In Rockbridge County
the excitement can be found on
Irish Creek, Mill Creek, South
River, and the Goshen Pass
sections of the Maury River. A
complete state-wide list of all
stocked waters is in this month’s
Virginia Wildlife magazine in the
library.

Fortunately, 1 will be far, away.

from the action. I intend to spend
my day deep in the National Forest
fly-fishing for native brook trout,
or on waters which have been
restricted to single hook, artificial
lures only. If I choose my stream
carefully, then I may not see any
other fishermen besides the two or
three in my group. If I choose my
flies and fish carefully, then I may

. catch and release a good number

of trout.
Fishing with a fly is the most
logical way to fish for trout.

Trout do not normally eat corn
because it does not occur naturally
in their environment, and because
they are unable to digest it. Trout
eat insects and larvae which live in
the stream with them. The dry
flies and nymphs of fly-fishermen
imitate these aquatic insects in
size, shape and color. However,
the trick is to make the trout think
that your fly (usually made of bits
of fur and feathers) is actually a
meal.

Casting a fly seems strange at
first. Spin-fishermen throw their
lure at a spot and the weight of

the lure pulls the line behind it.
The fly rod throws the flyline,
which is made of thick plastic
coated line.

At the end of the line is a
section of tapered monofilament,
with a fly tied to the end. The
momentum of the forward cast of
the flyline carries the fly and the
monofilament beyond. the heavy
flyline, where it should gently
settle to the water.

Fly-fishing is more complicated
than spin-fishing, but it does not
have to be difficult. The extra
concentration and practice are more
than compensated for by the
rewards. If you have ever caught
a fish on a fly rod then you know
the feeling. If you have not but
would like to, please attend some
meetings of the new W&L
Flyfishing Club and learn
something about the sport.

For further details, contact
professor John McDaniel in his
office (463-8791) or Chris Brand
and David Lawrence at the Slug
Ranch (463-3384).

The club meets on Thursday
afternoons. The time and place of
each particular meeting will be

Artist Katharine T. Carter will
present a slide-lecture on ‘‘Highlights
of the New York Art Season’’ on
Monday, March 20, at 8 p.m. in
duPont Hall. The lecture is open to
the public.

Carter, an active participant in the
New York art world, has developed
a series of annually updated slide
lectures that give her audiences a
comprehensive overview of the most
recent New York exhibition seasons.

In the presentation, slides are
shown of work being done in the
major art areas of painting, drawing,
sculpture, ceramic, photography and
printmaking. Relevant facts about the
professional background of each
artist, materials and technique, the
basic intent and theories underlying
the work, and the responses and
observations of the critics are
discussed.

 

DuPont exhibits

By Stephanie Smith
Staff Reporter

 

 

The artwork currently on display in duPont
Gallery by British artist Betsy Tyler Bell is a
combination of works inspired and created at
Washington and Lee during the past two months,
and a group of works on paper conceived at Bell’s
home in Oxford, England.

The exhibit’s opening was accompanied by a
performance piece choreographed by the artist and
adapted through a collaboration with Margaret
Brouwer, professor of music, and the fine arts
department. The piece was performed by W&L
fine arts students.

Bell said she feels that the artwork
‘encompasses her response to the world around
[her] in depicting the environment in a series of
fragments and fragmented images which evoke the
past, the present, and the future.’’

The annual W&L Student Art

A variety of works in drawing,

Series, are a complex method of relief printing
and transferred imagery; the four smaller works
are etchings and aquatints with color viscosity
printing, according to Bell.

Bell’s interest in the medium of handmade
paper derives from ‘“‘the built-in fragmented and
recycled nature.’ Remaining true to her medium,
the pieces Bell conceived at W&L are, she said,
“evolved mainly from fragmented materials
collected from faculty members.”’

The largest piece in the exhibition, titled
Reflections, is drawn directly from  Bell’s
“‘working, thought, and feelings about being at
Washington and Lee,”’

Bell is currently teaching a class at W&L in
papermaking. ‘“‘It is exciting to see how students
respond to material and have been able to change
their understanding of paper as an art medium and
not merely as a commodity to be used and
discarded,’’ Bell said.

Bell’s exhibit closes tomorrow evening.

 

A “*Make-Your-Own-Sundae’’

opponents. That’s an individual

“We came out ready to play
and we played very well,’ said co-
head coach David McLeod. ‘‘We
played hard every match. We
especially were keyed up for our
ODAC matches. We are placing a
lot of importance on our ODAC
matches this year.”’

On Tuesday afternoon, the
Generals went on the road to play
ODAC-rival Hollins. Despite
freezing weather conditions, W&L
was hot, burning Hollins by the
same 9-0 score. On Wednesday,
W&L grabbed an important ODAC
victory, defeating Mary Baldwin 9-
0 in Staunton. Mary Baldwin was
the team that nosed out W&L by
one-half point to win the ODAC
title last year.

The Generals have looked
strong all down the singles and
doubles line. Sophomores Jean
Stroman and Kelly Martone,
playing at No. 1 and 2 singles
respectively, have performed
extremely well. The Generals have
also picked up some excellent play
at No.’ 4 and 5 from two freshmen

runs in the first two innings to end
the game almost before it started.
Junior designated hitter Dave
Smith’s three-run __first-inning
homer was the decisive blow in
W&L’s eighteen-hit attack. Senior
catcher Eddie Klank had a pair of
two-run homers from his cleanup
spot, and his four RBIs tied Smith
for the team lead. Chris
Cunningham pitched five and 1/3
innings to gain the victory.

“I was surprised by _ the
homeruns. We jumped up on them
early, so we were able to hit-and-
run, steal and send guys to the
plate from second on singles.’’ said
Stickley. "Even against good
catchers, we have to keep running
to be successful. If it had been a
tight game we might not have been
able to...take chances."

Saturday was even better, as the
Generals got a pair of superb
pitching performances in _ the
double-header sweep. _ Freshman

Hathom, who had anticipated the
strength to come from the attack.

“Our attack players are more
experienced, but they need more
work than I expected,”’ she said.

Most important to the W&L
squad was the fact that the
Generals were able to be
competitive with Frostburg State.

“‘We had a sloppy stretch for
about 15 minutes that hurt us,”’
said Hathorn, whose team is
beginning its first year at the
varsity level. ‘‘Without that, we
could have kept the margin closer.

omfortto host night of song

Comfort, JubiLee, Sentinels, Charm, Sweet Tones and Octet to perform

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Washington and Lee’s select
12-man singing ensemble, Southern
Comfort, will host the first annual
‘Evening with Southern Comfort
and  Friends’’ Thursday _ night,
March 24, at 8 p.m. in the
General’s Headquarters.

Joining Southern Comfort for
the evening of singing will be

JubiLee, the select women’s
ensemble from W&L, the VMI
Sentinels, Baldwin Charm from

Mary Baldwin, the Sweetones from
Sweet Briar and Comfort’s special
guest ensemble, the University of

in Lexington next Thursday night.
Though each ensemble _ will
have its own unique style, each
will be rich in the musical tradition
of a capella singing. Some will
utilize extensive — choreography
while others will concentrate only
on music. Whatever the character
of any particular group, — the

evening promises to be a _ very
enjoyable experience.

For many years ensembles from
other schools have been coming to
W&L to join Southern Comfort in
concert, but never have this many
come at one time. Comfort student
leader Kevin Struthers said there had
been preliminary plans to hold the
concert in January but due to heavy
work and scheduling problems, the
concert had to be put on hold. Then,
about a month and a half ago,
Struthers learned that the Berkeley
Octet would be coming through and
saw the chance to put together an in-
credible evening of music.

Southern Comfort was founded

For new cuisine, go Down

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

For anyone looking for a new
dining experience, why not go
Down Under? No, you don’t
have to go to Australia. You just
have to go 16 Lee Avenue here
in Lexington to try the newest
cuisine in town.

The new Down Under
restaurant and sandwich shop was
pened three weeks ago by local den-
list Dr. Richard Hull in the
old Subway Sandwich Shop
location ‘‘down under’’ the street
on Lee Avenue. Hull, who serves
as the District Chairman and
Vice-President of the Stonewall
fackson area council for the Boy
Scouts of America, said he got
the idea to open the restaurant
last year when he took 120 Boy
Scouts from Virginia to the
World Boy Scout Jamboree in
\ustralia. Hull said he loved
\ustralia so much that he decided
‘Oo. open a restaurant in the
\ustralian motif here in
Lexington,

Australian decorations, but the
aspects that set this restaurant

apart from others in town don’t
stop there.

Down Under retains the basic
shape of the old Subway Shop
but is much brighter. The brick
walls have been painted white
and the floor sky blue. Ceiling
fans and small spotlights on the
side walls have been added as
well as a gas burning stove that
makes the small restaurant kink
of homelike.

The walls feature wooden
plaques of the Australian
continent as well as kangaroos of
different sizes all painted with
indigo blue paint. Pictures and
posters from the — various
America’s Cup races hang on the
walls as well as pictures of Paul
Hogan and Linda Kozlowski from
the Crocodile Dundee films.
“No Swimming - Crocodile
Crossing’? and ‘‘Last Pub - 897
km’’ signs also adom various
walls. One interesting feature is a
huge big screen television that

about the food?

The Down Under menu features
mainly deli sandwiches, but has
different kinds of pizza, salads
and soups as well. All of the deli
meats come from the Thumann
Meat Company in New York; the
company that Hull says supplies
all of New York’s finest delis
with their meat products.

The waitresses at Down Under
as well as other people I have
talked to who have eaten at the
new restaurant suggest that the
‘*Tasmanian Devil’’, a hot ham,
pastrami and turkey sandwich and
theSoutk Pacific= Piz’, a
pizza with tomato sauce, two
layers of cheese, canadian bacon
and pineapple on it have been the
favorite foods so far. Personally,
I have had the Pastrami and
Cheese sub and the South Pacific
Pizza and both were very gcod.
The pizza is a different, light
taste but one I think most people
will enjoy.

The restaurant serves both
imported beer such as Red Stipe,
Heineken, Lowenbrau, Molson
and Amstel Light as well as
domestic beer such as Bud,

promises to be both enjoyable and
exciting. The concert is free of
admission and is open to anyone
who wishes to come. The concert
should start shortly after eight, but
due to limited seating in the GHQ,
those attending the concert are
urged to come a little early. Early
or late, don’t miss out on this very
special evening of music with
Southern Comfort and Friends.

The restaurant runs a_ special
each day and will continue to add

though, the people at own

Under want you to come ty the
cuisine and tell them what they
can do to improve the new
restaurant.

‘*We are open, we have carry out
and we deliver,’’ said Hull.

“‘We will try to meet your needs
while serving you first quality
food. We want you to make
suggestions and tell us what we
can do better.”’

Down Under is open seven
days a week and will deliver
from 11 am. to 2 p.m. every
day, and at night from 5 p.m. to
