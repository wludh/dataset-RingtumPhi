Yesterday's, today’s and
tomorrow’s fraternity members will
be bearing the burden of renovating
fraternity houses as the university
begins its Fraternity Renaissance Pro-
gram in the spring of 1990.

In a presentation designed to clear
up misconceptions about the program,
University President John D. Wilson,
board of trustees member J. Thomas
Touchton, VMDO architect David
Oakland and chairman of the Fraterni-
ty House Renovation Steering Com-
mittee, Col. Paul Murphy, spoke to an
audience of mostly freshmen and
sophomores in Lee Chapel Tuesday
night.

The most important feature of the
Renaissance program centers around
the renovation of the individual
chapter houses.

“*We want to preserve the character
of the houses,’’ said Oakland, one of
the architects for the project.

The board of trustees will finance
the renovations for $10 million. Half
of that $10 million will come from a

Live Drive
recruiting
members

By Stacy L. Morrison

Live Drive, which describes itself
as a student organization ‘‘committed
to the elimination of intoxicated driv-
ing,’’ will hold a new member
registration drive next week.

““We don’t have adequate human
resources yet,’’ said Live Drive co-
ordinator John Fialcowitz. Every day
from noon to | p.m., Live Drive
members will have a table outside the
Co-op and the law school library to
recruit new members, said Live Drive
Publicity Director Amy Sapp.

‘*We’re looking to get more people
driving so we can run more often,”’
Sapp said. Prospective drivers must
have ‘‘a good driving record and a
high sense of responsibility,’’ said
Fialcowitz.

Sapp said Live Drive would like to
recruit enough members so that each
member would have to put in only two
hours a month.

Currently, there are 31 drivers.in the
organization, said Fialcowitz, and ap-
proximately 40 people in the group al-
together. ‘“‘There is too much of a
strain on a small group of people, ‘‘
said Fialcowitz.

Anyone who is interested at all
should sign up, Sapp said. ‘‘There are
a lot of things to do besides driving,”’
she said, such as scheduling and pub-
licity. The group also needs people to
ride with the students who drive the
vans.

To date, Live Drive has carried
1,076 students since it began running
Homecoming weekend this year, said
Sapp. For last week’s Connells con-
cert at the new pavilion, Live Drive
transported 193 students.

‘*We have been pleased that people
have been using Live Drive, said
Sapp, but she thinks not enough
students feel comfortable leaving their
cars at a function and using the Live
Drive van to get home if they have had
too much to drink.

direct grant from the university
through alumni and other donations.

The other $5 million is a loan to in-
dividual : fraternities. The loan’s
repayment will be stretched over the
next 30 years. ‘‘We feel,’’ said
Touchton, ‘‘that the cost should be
borne by the fraternity members of the
future who will benefit most from the
renovations. We also feel that the
fraternity members of the past should
help pay because they are partially
responsible for the present condi-
tion.”’

Wilson said that after houses are
rebuilt, fraternity members can expect
to pay higher dues and rent. ‘‘Rent
should include some money for the
cleaning and maintenance of the
houses,’’ he said.

However, he added that he hoped
“‘room and board will be no more ex-
pensive than similar university ser-
vices.””

Oakland said that because fraternity
house rent is so low, residents treat it
as low rent housing. Parties are the
other cause of damage to houses,
Oakland said. Each new house design
will include a specially designed party
facility.

In trade for new houses, fraternities
are required to adopt the ‘‘Standards
for Fraternities at Washington and
Lee University’’ adopted by the uni-
versity last year. The standards set
forth operating guidelines that define
the privileges and responsibilities of
the fraternity houses. The standards
also state that fraternity housing must
be equal in conditions to university
housing.

House mothers are included in the
standards as well. Associate Dean of
Students, Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy”’ Atkins,
said, ‘‘House mothers are there to
serve as a resident manager, to make
life more convenient for the residents.
They're there so the students don’t
have to worry about the day to day
running of the house. Students age
here to go to school, not be a
housewife or a handyman.”’

In his address to the Greek com-
munity, Col. Murphy dispelled two
popular myths about the Fraternity
Renaissance program. The first myth,
he said, is that the university plans to
close the fraternities after they gain
control of them. He recalled a recent
Ring-tum Phi cartoon saying that the
best way to get rid of fraternities is by

helping them. Murphy emphasized
that this was not the case and the uni-
versity has no ulterior motive in the
program.

The other myth, he said, is that the
*‘Standards for Fraternities’’ will turn
them into ‘‘mamby-pamby eating
clubs.’ This also is not true, he said.

“Party facilities are being included

in every house design so members can
continue to party in the style they have
become accustomed to.’ He added
that party facilities are usually the
single most expensive item in the
renovation.

During his address, Wilson describ-
ed the state of fraternities over the last
two decades. Counter-culture values

have become a part of fraternities over
the last 20 years, he said. It began
with the war effort, he said, and de
veloped into anti-military, anti
government and anti-fraternity.

The result has been a loss of leader
ship in fraterm‘ies. loss of support

Students, parents, faculty and

written by J. Thomas Touchton of the

Sorority rush set to start

Three Sororities Make The Final Cut

 

by Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

Three national sororities, Chi
Omega, Kappa Alpha Theta and Kap-
pa Kappa Gamma, will begin coloniz-
ing on the W&L campus Jan. 22.

The Sorority Advisory Committee
voted on the decision in its meeting
last Sunday, Jan. 8, after discussing
the presentations that five national
sororities gave on campus last week.
Kappa Delta and Pi Beta Phi were the
two sororities not selected after the
presentations.

The advisory committee, comprised
of students, faculty and administra-
tion, invited the sororities to make
presentations at W&L according to the
interest of women indicated on a
Sorority Interest Survey and after con-
sidering research the committee had
done on the sororities that had con-
tacted W&L. The committee gave
each of the sororities a list of ques-
tions concerning such issues as the

process of rush and colonization and
the possibility of housing assistance.

The criteria for selection included
how long a chapter advisor from the
national sorority would remain on
campus to assist the colony and how
well the presentation answered the
committee’s questions. The com-
mittee also considered the sorority’s
statement of discrimination against
race, religion, creed or handicap.
Students attending the presentations
were encouraged to leave the com-
mittee written comments about the
sororities.

For the presentations, each of the
sororities sent officers from their
national office and representatives
who had advised chapters colonizing
on other campuses. Some of the
sororities brought current members
from other campuses and invited their
local alumni to come also.

The individual sororities will send
their national representatives for ex-
tension to the W&L campus. The

Executive Committee

EC appoints committee to review CRC

 

By Genienne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

After reviewing the recently releas-
ed Confidential Review Committee
(CRC) procedures Monday
night, the Executive Committee mov-
ed to form a sub-committee to present
the CRC with several suggestions
concerning the new procedures.

E.C. members Dan DuPre and
Dave Nave and E.C. Secretary Eddie
Yu were appointed to the committee
which was to present the suggestions
this week to Professor Samuel J.
Kozak, head of the CRC.

Specifically, several E.C. members
said they were concerned that the pro-

cedures did not allow for cross-

examination of the complainant during
the hearing. The question was raised
as to whether the lack of cross-
examination was inflicting on the right
of those involved to due process of
law.

There were additional problems
found with the wording of some of the
sections of the procedures.

Nave said that he believes the
CRC’s definition of sexual harassment
is unclear. He said he would like to
see a more precise definition or an ex-
planation as to why the definition is
vague.

The E.C. has no power to actually
make changes in the procedures,
which were adopted by the faculty at
its December meeting.

According to Kozak, copies of the

CRC procedure are availzble through
the office of Lewis John, dean of
students.

Kozak said that as of now the pro-
cedures are in their final working
form, adding that if the CRC finds that
the procedures are not workable it will
review and modify them in the future.

The CRC was formed by a faculty
vote last spring after an ad hoc review
committee decided that there was not a
sufficient outlet for complaints of an
especially sensitive subject matter,
those dealing with cases of sexual,
racial or religious slurs and sexual
harassment

The committee is composed of four
faculty members and three students.

national director for the extension of
sororities, Mrs. William Bradford,
also will come to the campus to
organize the rush and colonization
process. All W&L women wishing to
participate in the colonizing of
sororities must attend one of the two
mandatory pre-rush registrations; the
first registration meeting was on
Wednesday, and the second will be
from 4 to 6 p.m Friday, Jan. 13, in
Lee Chapel.

On Sunday, Jan. 22, the sororities
will begin holding ‘‘open houses’’ in
various rooms of the University
Center, according to the advisory
committee. Monday and Tuesday,
Jan. 23 and 24, they will interview
groups of women.

Wednesday, Jan. 25, the sororities
will ask the women back to
‘preference parties’’ after a process
of matching the women’s preference
to those of the sororities. On Thurs-
day, Jan. 26, the sororities will extend
their bids to the women.

believes the changes in the fraternity
system will help elevate the fraternity
system to the high level of standards
shared by the rest of the university
community.

Touchton said in the letter that the
fraternity system has not been em-
phasizing the qualities and values that
W&L stands for. He also said an
*‘animal house fraternity culture’ has
become popular over the last two
decades and this was something that
has been tolerated too long.

‘The board of trustees does not in-

tend to be supportive of the behavior
at W&L that reflects negatively on our
institution and its values,’’ Touchton
wrote.

Touchton cited negative values such
as the abuse of alcohol, drugs and
female guests. He also said students
“‘can be more conscious of
their academic opportunities. "’

Dean of the College John Elrod
said, ‘‘Tom Touchton thinks it is
necessary to communicate’ with
everybody who has a vested interest.”’

Wilson returns

‘to Wé&aL

By Genienne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

Washington & Lee President John
D. Wilson, who returned on Dec. 14
after a three month leave of absence
spent in England, said he enjoyed
every day of his time abroad but is
happy to be back on campus.

Wilson said the board of trustees
gave him the ‘‘gift’’ of three months
away from his administrative duties so
he could concentrate on scholarly ac-
tivities. He went to England because
he graduated from Oxford University
and wanted a chance to return to fur-
ther explore the subject of England
during the 16th century.

Specifically, Wilson said he was in-
terested in relations between England
and Ireland during the 16th century.
He said he spent most of his three
months researching ‘‘an unusual Irish
character’? named Hugh O'Neill.

According to Wilson, O’Neill went
to England as a young boy and spent
seven years living with the prominent
English family of Sir Philip Sidney.
After learning English and the religion
of the English people. O'Neil
returned to Ireland where he himself
rose to a prominent position, rebelled
against the English Queen Elizabeth
and demanded both restoration of con-
fiscated Irish and freedom of religion

duties

for the Irish.

Wilson said O'Neill was a major
force in the attempt to unite Ireland at
that time.

Wilson said at Oxford he was able
to get library materials on the subject
not otherwise available to him. He
said he also got the chance to visit
many of the places in Ireland that were
important in O’Neill’s life.

In addition to his research on
O'Neill, Wilson said he learned a lot
about the problems Oxford is facing
today. Specifically, he said the
students at Oxford were ‘‘up-in-
arms’ over the fact that the Thatcher
government wanted to introduce stu-
dent loans rather than academic
grants.

“‘It was interesting to see the argu-
ment unfold, ** he said, adding that
although in the United States students
are used to the idea of educational
loans, the concept is new to the
English.

Wilson also met with several W&L
students who are presently studying at
Oxford.

While he was away Wilson said he
had very little contact with the univer-
sity or Dean of the College John
Elrod, who was acting president dur-
ing his absence.

The Washington and Lee University
Minority Student Association will
celebrate Martin Luther King’s birth-
day Monday, Jan. 16, at 8 p.m. at the
First Baptist Church in Lexington.
The theme of this year’s program is
“Words and Music in Celebration of
the Life of Martin Luther King, Jr.”’
The program will feature Lovida H.
Coleman Jr., a Washington, D.C.
lawyer as the principle speaker, and

the Washington and Lee Glee Club
will sing spiritual music.

Coleman said she will be speaking
on the continuing relevance of the a-
chievements of Martin Luther King
with focus on how these achievements
relate to each individual person.

“His ultimate destiny is still to be
determined by what each of us do,”’
she said in a telephone interview to-
day. Coleman said the speech will

- OPINION

 

Sororities ...

The inevitable has arrived. After three and a half years of wat-
ching and waiting, sorority rush will begin on Jan. 22.

The debate began back in 1985 when W&L’s first coed class
enrolled. Would there be sororities? Dissension and indecision
among the group of just over 100 women shoved the debate into the
shadows, for the university administration decided to defer the
decision on sororities until there were four classes of women at
W&L. Even so, the debate continued. Petitions and surveys floated
around campus, but the results never indicated a majority of women

interested in colonizing sororities.

Arguments for and against sororities abound. The former argue
that sororities would provide ‘‘a place to call our own’’ and a
‘place to return to when we graduate.’ The latter argue that
sororities would foster cliques and division among the already small

numbers of women.

However, the fact is that rush will start, regardless, in 10 days.
Obviously, those women who pushed for sororities will participate,
but those who were of the opposite opinion should also consider
rushing—if only to prevent the sorority system from becoming what
they were afraid it could become in the first place—the stereotype of
cliquey and snotty girls. It is not hypocritical if one considers it this

way.

People benefit from diverse viewpoints since they become open
to more possibilities. The concerns of those women who were
against sororities can become a sounding board to help the female
Greeks become more unified and sensitive to the needs and con-
cerns of women in the W&L community.

Sororities must be viewed as a challenge—the clay that W&L
women must shape into a form that accommodates many different

tastes.

Year In Review

Sbar view
by Jon Sbar

ON a cold day in January when
our ancestors were still evolving from
large reptiles, a lazy prehistoric
neanderthal journalist named Toad
was watching ‘‘Return of the Tyran-

nosaurus Rex’’ on television when .

suddenly the telephone rang. It was
the editor of the ‘‘Daily Dinosaur’’
calling to remind Toad that he had a
story deadline in three hours.

As Toad began brainstorming for a
story subject, it occurred to him that
he could save time and energy by
writing an article commemorating the
top stories of last year. Toad’s idea
caught on and ever since that day,
newspaper readers have been bom-
barded in early January with
thousands of ‘‘Year in Review’’ ar-
ticles written by lazy journalists.
Because I am a lazy journalist and
because it is early January, I am com-
pelled to review last year’s top news
stories. Stop: The Society for the
Preservation of Prehistoric History
interrupts this article to correct Mr.
Sbar’s total disregard for the
historical record. First of all, man
did not evolve from large reptiles,
he did not have television sets and
telephones, and finally, there is no
evidence whatsoever that a
newspaper publication entitled
“The Daily Dinosaur’? or a man
named Toad ever existed.

The first great news story of 1988 is
‘*Merit-badge grudge festers,’’ a UPI
report published in the Tampa
Tribune. A 25-year-old man in Illinois
‘*stalked and stabbed’’ his Scout-
master because when the former Boy
Scout was in eighth grade (12 years
ago) the Scoutmaster denied him a

» merit badge. The estranged Boy Scout

- decided to track down his old Scout-

master after he happened to see him
drive pastoneday,

ihe best letter wiitten to a publica-

tion in 1988 was from someone who

wrote to Parade Magazine espousing

the belief that Manic Depression is a

sexually transmitted disease.

‘*Male Striper Bumps and Grinds
Down Candy Aisle in Circle K”’
comes from the AP and the Salt Lake
City Tribune. At 3 a.m. in a Circle K
store, a man stripped to a G-string and
leather jacket and ‘‘bumped and
ground’’ his way down the candy ai-
sle, much to the delight of the female
clerk. Later that night, the man was
arrested for indecent exposure outside
of a different convenience store.

Another top story of the year con-
cerns that pelvis-thrashing, Saturday
matinee movie making, side burn
growing drug-using rock star, Elvis
Presley. Although he died years ago,
millions of people claim to have seen
‘‘The King’’ working at gas stations,
surfing in California, selling en-
cyclopedias or break dancing in New
York City. While these theories sound
plausible, I know them to be incor-
rect. I can say this because I know
where Elvis really is. In fact, I talked
to him yesterday. Here’s the real
story: He’s a finance major right here
at W&L, he’s in a Southern fraternity
(don’t forget, he’s from Tennessee),
he’s off hard drugs and now only oc-
casionally uses recreational drugs,
and he plans to be a stock broker. If
we play our cards right, I bet we could
get him to play at Fancy Dress.

As predicted by literacy critics, the
Weekly World News had another
banner 1988. Here are the headlines
from some of the better stories:

**Steroids turn man into bigfoot’’

*‘Noah’s Ark found on Soviet
Mountain’’

“Man sneezes so hard — eyeballs
pop out”’

“‘UFO base camp found in New
Mexico’’

‘“*Toddler grows up in ant bed —
ants fed her for years’’

**12-year-old classmate gets teacher
and four classmates pregnant’’

“‘Doctor keeps wife’s head alive for
10 years”’

(Special note for skeptical
readers; these headlines are totally
fictional. My sources have verified

every single one.)

Prospectives with athletic potential being unfairly overlooked

To the Editors:

I think most of the juniors and seniors would
agree that Washington and Lee us not the same
school they came to three or four years ago. We
have been forced to accept changed social at-
mosphere, increased faculty involvement in stu-
dent activities and affairs, and occasional, un-
justified police harassment whether we like it or
not, most W&L students have accepted this
change as permanent. Also, Washington and Lee
has begun to increase the standards of acceptance
to new heights. My concern is that we are
overlooking prospective students who could

potentially add a lot more to W&L than just ab- ©

normally high test scores.

Certainly, a brilliant student is to be credited,
however, W&L has never been and should not
pretend to be a school of bookworms. W&L
should look for a well-rounded student who may
add to other aspects of student life. One need not
look any further than the athletic department for
evidence of this phenomena. Just about every
coach is having a nightmare recruiting because of
the standards imposed by the admissions com-
mittee. If this trend continues, I don’t see it possi-
ble to compete with other schools such as David-

Letters

 

son and Emory who will allow their coaches the
opportunity to recruit athletes who may not have
done particularly well on one section of the SAT, -
but have demonstrated the ability to work hard
and excel in all aspects of their high school ca-
reers.

The truth is that W&L is rejecting many of
these student/athletes who are being accepted at
Davidson, Emory and Vanderbilt — all schools
that W&L is constantly competing with and being
compared to. The disheartening fact of the matter
is that these students want to come to W&L and
help continue a tradition which has existed for
over 100 years. The admissions committee and
certain members of the faculty seem to be under a
type of ‘‘peer pressure’ to see how high they can
make the median SAT. Id this the criteria of a tru-
ly exceptional university? I think not.

To this end, what is wrong with giving W&L
athletics the opportunity to be competitive in a
national atmosphere? Why should coaches be re-
stricted to recruiting players with above 1100 on
their SAT? I am not saying to let every athlete in,
but certainly some concessions can be made to
help coached recruit players who are getting in to
other highly competitive universities. Without a

doubt, putting a little emphasis on athletic success
cannot help but to increase the reputation of the
school. Who doesn’t want to be associated with a
winner? Look at schools such as Stanford, which
maintains its reputation as one of the most com-

<

~

petitive schools in the country and has won °

NCAA Championships in tennis, baseball,
swimming and gymnastics in the past five years.
Successful extracurricular activities do nothing
but enhance the reputation of a school. We have
started to improve our facilities with the construc-
tion of a new arts building and hopefully that will

«

«

encourage more performers to come to W&L. ,

However, 40 percent of the W&L student body
participates in varsity athletics and look at our
facilities compared to Davidson, Emory and
Rhodes(all schools similar in size to W&L) and
you can see that little commitment the administra-
tion has made to athletics. Maybe this problem is
not evident now, but as someone who tries to keep
up with athletics, I think it is just a matter of time.
If this trend continues, not only will our athletic
teams be losers, but the school itself will be a big
loser.

ROTC scholarships offer more than just financial aid

To the Editors:

I am writing in response to the headline printed
above an article on ROTC scholarships in the
Dec. | issue. The headline reads, ‘‘ROTC has a
deal for needy students.’’ This makes me think
that the editors believe that ROTC is just another
form of financial aid. This could not be further
from the truth.

The mission of Army ROTC is to commission
the future officer leadership of the United States
Army. It is not to provide funds for the ‘tneedy”’
students of W&L to attend college. The Army
provides scholarships to help students during their
college years but it is by no means a free handout.

ROTC scholarship recipients work for that schol-
arship, both physically and mentally. However,
the reward is a commission as a second lieutenant.
A recipient of financial aid may receive a diploma
after four years, but only those in the ROTC pro-
gram will receive the ‘‘special trust and con-
fidence’ given by a commission in the Armed
Forces from the President of the United States.
Most, if any all, of our Cadets on scholarship
do not need the Army to pay for their tuition.
They joined the ROTC program because they are
not satisfied with being run-of-the-mill. They
want the responsibility, the challenge that is avail-
able through the Armed Forces. A second lieute-

nant in some cases will give orders that ask of his
men what, in other circumstances, no one would
have the right to ask. Do you still feel that ROTC
is just another form of financial aid? I hope not
because by doing so you not only insult those who
are in the ROTC program now but also those who
have dedicated their lives to a profession tasked
with protecting the democratic society which
allows you to be so creative in your journalism. I
hope I have sufficiently cleared up this matter and
I thank you for your attention.

W&L women’s clubs to offer alternatives to sororities

To the undergraduate women at Washington
and Lee:

The women of W&L will be making several im-
portant decisions in the near future. These deci-
sions will have a significant impact on the social
scene at W&L. We represent a group of women
interested in establishing social organizations
different from sororities. Encouraged by the ad-
ministration’s stated commitment to respond to

the wishes of a significant number of women, a
steering committee has been organized, has met,
and is preparing a proposal to the university. This
proposal will be discussed at a meeting slated for
next week (look for flyers) and could include con-
sideration of eating clubs or similar non-
exclusionary social groups. We invite all inter-
ested women to join us to learn about and con-
tribute to the proposal.

Honor code called into con@ideration on the subject of alcohol

To the Editors:

Consider the following argument:

1. It is dishonorable knowingly to break the
law.

2. All W&L students know that it is against the
law for anyone under 21 to purchase, possess or

consume any alcoholic beverage.

3. Therefore, any W&L student under 21 who
purchases, possesses or consumes any alcoholic
beverage is dishonorable.

I suspect that very many people will have an in-
terest in denying the conclusion of this argument,
and hence they will reject the argument. But on

Student Calis for Rejuvenated Mascot

To the Editors;

In attempts to raise school spirit I began to think
about our school’s mascot. I quickly realized that
we do not use our mascot, the General, on many
of our official banners, uniforms, notebooks, etc.
Also, we do not have a live representation of our

to Coach McHenry, the E.C., and some students;
all were enthusiastic about having a mascot at the
games, but they were unsure about keeping our
current mascot. (The Yosemite Sam looking gen-

what grounds? Does the conclusion not follow

APO Christmas Tree has Become a Library Tradition

To the Editors:

Those of us who enjoyed the Christmas tree in
the main lobby of the University Library during
the hectic two weeks before the holiday break are
indebted to W&L’s service organization, APO,

and in particular to Dan Knight, Dorothy Mills,
and Steve Ingram of that organization. The three
students spent an afternoon finding the tree, chop-
ping it down and placing it in a tree stand. The
**APO Christmas tree’’ has become a tradition at
the library. I would be remiss in my duty if I did

not direct the praise and appreciation for the tree
to those who did the work!

Education
concerns

IFC

by Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

The majority of the Jan. 3 Inter-
fraternity Council meeting dealt with
the upcoming period of pledge edu-
cation for freshmen in Washington
and Lee’s 16 fraternity houses. In ad-
dition to the normal representatives,

pledge class presidents were invited to
listen to the details of this stage in

their preparation for initiation. In ac-

cordance with By-Law VII of the IFC

Constitution, the pledge education
programs will begin Monday, Jan. 9,
and must not continue for more than
10 weeks.

IFC President Ross Singletary and
W&L’s Dean of Greek Affairs, Leroy
C. ‘Buddy’’ Atkins, stressed the
rules for pledge programs as laid
down in the IFC Constitution. All
forms of hazing are prohibited, as are
any activities that may pose a physical
or emotional hazard to the individual.

Pledge activities are limited to one:
weeknight per week and must not take ?

place outside the corporate limits of f

Lexington, in or around the freshman)
dormitories or at any time past 8 p.m.

Fraternities nationwide are facing
the dangerous consequences of pledge
hazing in the forms of forced alcohol
consumption and physical and emo-
tional abuse. Dean Atkins said that if
any serious problems
such as these arise, it will mean ‘‘the
end of your chapter on this campus for
good’’ with ‘‘no appeal.’’ He added
that “‘this is the single biggest problem
that fraternities have... it's got to stop,
and this is the year it’s going to.”’

The 28 W&L pledges who did not
achieve the 1.9 cumulative grade point
average required for initiation are
subsequently ineligible to participate
in pledge programs until they have
brought up their average. Likewise,
they cannot be required by their
fraternities to maintain residence in
the house during their sophomore
year.

Casino night ‘Big’ success

 

By Genienne Mongo
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee Muscular
Dystrophy Superdance Committee
sponsored the first Casino Night in the
General’s Headquarters Tuesday night
and according to the members of the
committee, it was a big success.

“‘It was a phenomenal success!”
said senior Debra Hurtt, co-
chairmwoman of the Superdance
Committee. She said the total intake
for the evening ws $1,300, but more
important than the money raised was
the enthusiasm generated for the
Superdance.

‘*The important thing about this and
other promotional events is that we
spread the word about Muscular
Dystrophy and educate the student
body, including the law students.
Hopefully, this will create an en-
thusiasm and influence people to do-
nate their time and money,” said
Wright Ledbetter, co-chairman of the
Superdance Committee.

The original idea for Casino Night
belonged to Lea Santamaria, head of
the Specials Events Committee who is
studying abroad for the rest of the

year. She followed through with the
idea and found all the equipment
needed before she left, said Ledbetter.

The rest of the committee took over
where Santamaria left off, creating a
simulated casino where students could
purchase and gamble with fake
**Superdance Dollars.”’

The event was open by invitation
only to those undergraduate and law
students over the age of 21. According
to Ledbetter, the committee was
“trying to be in touch with the older
crowd and the law students who are a
vital part of the W&L community.”

Originally, the event was scheduled
to run from 9:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m.,
but because so many students showed
up, the gambling was allowed to con-
tinue until 12:30 a.m.

Afterwards, the students were given
a chance to use their “‘Superdance
Dollars’’ to bid for a variety of prizes
at an auction held in the Fairfax
Lounge. Prizes included ski passes, a
Fancy Dress package, free tuxedo ren-
tals and Superdance shirts.

Ledbetter said he was especially
thankful to all the people who donated
their time to make Casino Night a
success, including the staff of the

General’s Headquarters and the Chi
Psi fraternity, whose pledges were on
hand all night to run the various
tables.

“IT hope the enthusiasm displayed
tonight can be carried through the re-
maining weeks leading up to the actual
dance. We hope to get the entire stu-
dent body involved,”’ said Ledbetter.

Faculty sponsor Fontanne Bostic
said, “‘It’s not too late to participate,
either by being a dancer or a spec-
tator. Dance for those who can’t.
That's what it’s all about.””

The Muscular Dystrophy Super-
dance will be held in the student ac-
tivities building on Feb. 3 and 4 from
6:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Friday night
will feature a ‘‘Battle of the Bands”
contest and Saturday there will be two
“*big name bands”’ to be announced in
the next few weeks, said Bostic.

Students who want to dance must
raise a minimum of $100 in pledges.
The grand prize will be awarded to the
dancer with the most pledges/cash
raised. Any student interested in danc-
ing should pick up an information
packet at Carol Calkins’ office in the
University Center.

Among some off the wall facts that

Washington and Lee is mentioned
eight times in Alma Mater. In addition
to the aforementioned categories,

W&L is included in lists that contain

colleges named for George Washing-

TALKBACK

 

' Library celebrates

decade of service

Staff Report

 

Tuesday marked the 10th an-
niversary of the opening of the new
Washington and Lee University
Library.

It was 10 years ago that day when
1,700 volunteers — students, alumni,
faculty, staff, and townspeople —
toted Leggett department store shop-
ping bags full of books from the old
McCormick Library to the univer-
sity’s new 130,000-square-foot
building. In an unprecedented com-
munity wide effort, 140,000 books
were moved from the old library to the
proper shelf areas in the new facility
in 2 and one-half hours. The ‘Great
Move’’ was not only a tremendous
feat of meticulous planning and com-

munity goodwill; it was the social
event of the year. Volunteers were
treated to snacks and lunch and T-
shirts were awarded by lottery
throughout the day. Undergraduate
classes were cancelled and a huge par-
ty was held by the university for
everybody who participated in the
move.

The old McCormick Library was
renovated to become the home fo the
W&L School of Commerce,
Economics and Politics, while the new
library provided the much needed
space and physical capabilities that
were critically needed.

On Tuesday, the library held an
open house celebrating its 10th birth-
day. Refreshments were served in the
main lobby throughout the day.

Harassment policy

finalized

By Heather M. Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

 

The Confidential Review Com-
mittee (CRC) has composed its policy
on harassment at Washington and
Lee.

The CRC deals with any case of
**Ethnic, racial, religious, or sexual
nature that has the purpose or effect of
substantially or unreasonably interfer-
ing with an individual’s work or edu-
cational performance; of creating an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive en-
vironment for work or learning; or of
adversely affecting an individual's
quality of life.”

Sexual harassment, which appears
to be the most obscure form of
harassment, can include anything

by CRC

Students for Minority and Interna-
tional Student Affairs, Dean Mc-
Cloud.

McCloud emphasizes that ‘*No ac-
tions will be taken without the ap-
proval of the alleged victim. A person
who feels she/he has been victimized
may just come over and talk about it; I
can explain the options possible. "”

The options possible for taking ac-
tion against an offender range in se-
verity, depending on the incident. A
student may choose to resolve the
problem in a consultation with the
accused and McCloud, or take the
case to the CRC. At any point in time,
the victim has the option to discon-
tinue the process.

If the case is submitted to the CRC,
it will be handled with discretion ac-
cording to the rules the CRC has set

 

Sexual harassment can include anything
from ‘‘so-called ‘teasing,’ sexual innuen-
dos, and bullying of a sexist nature,’’ to
‘‘explicit sexual harassment...”
-Association of American Colleges

 

from *‘so-called ‘teasing,’ sexual in-
nuendos, and bullying of a_ sexist
nature, both physical and verbal,”’ to
“explicit sexual harassment up to and
including sexual aggression,’’ as
defined in an article put forth by the
Association of American Colleges.

This type of harassment can also en-
tail offensive jokes, objectionable pic-
tures in a public place, remarks about
someone’s body, unwanted touching
or kissing, persistent sexual attention,
requests for sexual activity and
obscene telephone messages.

According to the policy of the CRC,
**An individual who feels that he/she
has been the victim of ethnic, racial,
religious and/or sexual harassment is
urged to consult, as soon as possible
after the incident has occurred, the
Associate Dean of Students for
Minority and International Student
Affairs, a member of the University
Counseling Service, the Associate
the Dean of Students’ staff, a dor-
mitory counselor or a_ peer
counselor. ”’
counselor. ””

If the victim agrees, the incident
shall be taken to the Associate Dean of

up. The complainant and the accused
will be notified that the incident has
been referred to the CRC. After the
CRC reviews written statements of the
incident as described by both the
accused and the complianant and a
summary of the investigation, it will
hold a hearing approximately one
week later.

During the hearing, both the com-
plainant and the accused may be ac-
companied by an advisor from the
University community. The com-
plainant, the accused and t heir respec-
tive advisors may listen to the
testimony; however, all testimony and
written statements are confidential.
The accused and the complainant will
be notified of the CRC’s decision as
soon as possible.

McCloud encourages any students
with further questions to come and
talk with her; she will also answer
questions concerning procedures for
claims of students against faculty
members.

“All of this is for the purpose of
creating a campus environment in
which ALL STUDENTS, regardless
of gender, race or religion, can feel
comfortable,’’ said McCloud.

How do you feel about the following argument:

(1) It is illegal to consume/possess alcohol under the age of 21.
(2) It is an honor violation to break the law.

(3) Therefore, it is an honor violation to consume/possess alcohol under the age of 21.

Nicole Oden °91, Tampa, FL—I
don’t think W&L should dictate the
law to us. It is up to us as responsible
college students to decide whether or
not to drink. It is the same as an HV
for speeding.

Lydia Reid ‘91, Athens,
WV—That is too touchy of an issue to
answer in such a short time without
thought.

Hal Bailey °91, Memphis, TN—I
don’t feel the administration has the
right to tell us whether we can drink or
not. By consuming alcohol, we are not
lying about being 21. That is BS!

Eddy Klank °89, Memphis,
TN, John Stump °91, Washington,
D.C.—It is not an HV to consume
alcohol. The honor code should cover
only lying, cheating and stealing and
should not interfere elsewhere,

Martha Christian °89, Lyn-
chburg, VA—I do not feel it should
be an HV. The school should not be
involved in consumption possession of
alcohol under the age of 21.

Calif. psychiatrist to give two lectures

 

Staff Report

 

A series of lectures and discus-
sions will highlight Drug Awareness
Week at Washington and Lee Univer
sity Jan. 16-20

Two keynote lectures will be given
by Nelson M. Butters, chief of psy
chology services at the San Diego VA
Medical Center and professor of
psychiatry at the University of
California School of Medicine (San
Diego). During the past 20 years,
Butters has focused much of his
research on the chronic effects of
ethanol on memory and other
cognitive functions and has published
extensively on the subject.

On Tuesday, Jan. 17, a panel pro-
gram on drug information and edu-
cation will be presented in Lee Chapel
at 7:30 p.m. Members of the panel

will include U.S. Circuit Judge
George E. Honts, criminal in-
vestigator Doug Orbaugh, drug

counselor Marilyn Claytor and a
recovering student. The program is
open to the public.

Butters will present lectures on
Wednesday and Thursday, Jan. 18
and 19. Both are open to the public.

His Wednesday lecture, ‘Episodic,

4 p.m. in room 327 of the Commerce
School. On Thursday evening at 7:30

Butters received his A.B. degree
from Boston University in 1960, and
master’s and doctorate degrees from
Clark University. He is a licensed
psychologist, a Diplomate in Clinical
Neuropsychology (American Board of
Clinical Neuropsychology, American
Board of Professional Psychology),
and a member of the American Board
of Clinical Neuropsychology.

Prior to joining the staff at the San
Diego VA Medical Center, Butters
taught at Clark University, Nor-
theastern University, and Boston Uni-
versity School of Medicine. From
1967-1983, he served as a research

said, the university wants to revitalize
the fraternity system.

‘Fraternities too often represent
negative values,”’ said Touchton, rep-
resenting the board of trustees. With
this program, he said, **Fraternities
will be positive assets.”’

Construction can start as soon as
spring of 1990, said Atkins. Most of
the construction will take place in the
summer, using the spring term only if
it is necessary, said Wilson. When
asked where members will live and
chapters will meet, Wilson said,
‘That question has not been address-
ed yet, but provisions will be made.”’

Nicaraguan resistance leader
Adolfo Calero will speak at Washing-
ton and Lee University at 7:30 p.m.
Wednesday, Jan. 18, in Lee Chapel.

The lecture is sponsored by Con-
tact, a lecture series financed and ad-
ministered by a committee repre-
senting the student body.

Calero was forced into exile from
Nicaragua in 1982. Since then, he has
participated in an armed struggle to
campaign for the liberation of his
country. In 1983, he was nominated
for membership in the National Direc-
torate of the Nicaraguan Democratic
Force, where he served as president
and commander in chief. In 1985, he
joined the Directorate of the United
Nicaraguan Opposition, a position he
held until 1987, when he resigned to
serve on the Directorate of the
Assembly of the Nicaraguan
Resistance. There he represents the
Conservative political current.

Calero was born in Managua in
1931, the son of Adolfo Calero Oroz-
co, author of the historical novel
‘‘Sangre Santa.’’ He received a
degree in business administration
from the University of Notre Dame
and did post-graduate studies in in-
dustrial administration at Syracuse
University. In 1972, he received the
doctor of law degree from the Central
American University in Managua and
served there for one year as dean to
the faculty of administrative and
economic sciences.

In addition to serving on the boards
of several business enterprises in
Nicaragua, Calero worked as assistant
manager for W.R. Grace and Co.,
Central America, and as a general
manager of the Planta Embotelladora

RKTT NR TE TT SSL, a

Letter

 

(continued from page 1)

According to Elrod, Touchton
believes this is a change in the
magnitude of coeducation and it is im-
portant that everybody understand
why the board of trustees has called
for such a wide reaching program.

Elrod likened the board’s actions to
those of a loving parent. ““The parent
wants to do things for the child and if
the child cannot see the long term
benefits, then the parent will make
sure those things are done.”’

The Renaissance program will see
that each fraternity is renovated or
rebuilt with $10 million in financial
support. In trade for new houses, each
fraternity will accept and abide by
the‘‘Standards for Fraternities at
Washington and Lee University.’’ A
chapter does not have to accept the fi-
nancial support, but it will be required
to meet the housing standards. Each
chapter accepting the financial support
will have to release ownership of the
house to the university.

According to the letter, long term
benefits of the program include ‘‘a

more constructive fraternity envir-'
onment that we had just a few years ,
ago.”

Elrod said the Fraternity »
Renaissance will place a greater part
of the burden on fraternity members *
now than on those who come before or «
after.

According to Touchton’s letter, °
fraternities are an,,important part of a »
four-year college career. They pro-
vide lasting friendships, social '
benefits and leadership experience. It ,
is a responsibility of the board of
trustees, said Touchton, to provide
‘tan ‘outside the classroom’ envir- ,
ornment that is supportive of the fun-
damental academic purpose.”’ :

The letter zsked students to help the ,
university implement the program.
“It is our hope that this letter will "
cause you to begin to ask what you can ,
do to help us improve fraternities at
Washington and Lee.”’ ‘

The letter also stated that parents .

The paintings and sketches of
Ellen Graham Anderson, born in
1885 on- Letcher Avenue, can be

The 20-plus-piece exhibit in-

time General Lee served as presi-
dent of the university (1865-1870).
Three letters from G.W. Custis
Lee, who succeeded his father as
president of Washington and Lee,
were purchased from the library
through the generosity of William
R. Hill Jr. of Richmond. The
letters, which reveal the kind and
gentle personality of Custis Lee,
were written to Col. Charles Mar-
shall, General Lee’s wartime aide.
The Baxter Family Papers were

Misses Mary and Martha Coulling

papers of the Rev. George A. Bax-

Ellen Anderson, who died in
1970, attended the Art Students
League in New York City and later
studied at the Beaux Arts School in
Paris, said Bissett. She studied
under the French artist Guerin as
well, according to Bissett.

The outbreak of World War I
brought Anderson back to the
United States, where she worked in
New York City for 10 years,
Bissett said. Crippled by a knee in-
jury, she came back to her
childhood home on _ Letcher
Avenue and opened an art studio,
according to Bissett.

During this time, Anderson was
active in the historical society,
hospital boards and other local
groups, while she exhibited her
work in art shows throughout the
state, said Bissett.

At the end of January, the pain-
tings and sketches will be returned
to the various families who loaned
them to the school, according to
Bissett.

(continued from page 1)

Since its beginning there has been
heated debate as to whether the facul-
ty-dominated CRC has usurped stu-
dent power on campus by taking away
an important role of the Student Con-
duct Committee (SCC).

The E.C. submitted a formal pro-
posal in November for an alternate
committee to the CRC that would
change the formation of the committee
to a student majority.

On Nov.14 the faculty voted not to
look into the CRC proposals presented
to it, saying that it will review the
CRC in 1990.

In other business, freshman
Suzanne Sneed made a proposal to the
E.C. to purchase a mascot costume to
be used at university athletic events.
The E.C. said it will look into the
matter.

Senior David Burns reported on the
honor conference he attended last
year, and suggested that the E.C. look
into the possibility of using an
‘*Academic Integrity Video’’ as a way
of introducing the freshmen to the
Honor system. Burns presented ga

Additionally, senior Michael

Tuggle, eatertainment editor of the
Ring-tum Phi, requested that the E.C.
allocate money to fund a special
supplement to the Phi that will reflect
upon the last four years of co-
education. The supplement would
allow seniors and faculty to write
letters representing their views on the
subject.

The supplement will be an attempt
to ‘‘put a cap on the co-education
argument which has been brewing for
four years,’’ said Tuggle.

The E.C. voted to postpone its deci-
sion until it contacts the Publications
Board.

Senior Jim Cobb, chairman of

time is needed in order to schedule

The Live Drive program can be

Generals, Maroons set to renew rivalry

Wa&L captures Invitational

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

 

After a 29-day layoff, the Washing
ton and Lee basketball team returned
to the court as host of the 1989 W&l
Invitational, and rang in the new year
with wins over Elmira and Mount St
Mary to come away with the cham
pionship

Against Elmira last Thursday night
in the Warner Center, head coach
Verne Canfield knew his team would
be a little bit rusty. But what he and a
crowd of approximately 500 people
was beyond rusty. After the
game, Canfield said, ‘‘l am totally
dissatisfied with that effort. That is
terrible basketball.”’

In the first half, Canfield benched
some starters and went with reserves.
His reasoning was defense. **That is
probably the worst defense I have seen
a team play, and that is intolerable.
Some starters [found themselves] on
the bench in the first half because they
didn’t play team defense.”’

Although the Generals escaped with
an 85-78 decision, the statistics tell the
story. In the second half, W&L shot
an anemic 38 percent from the field
(12-31) while Elmira shot 42 percent
(14-33). The Generals shot 27 of 42
from the foul line, for 64 percent.
W&L turned the ball over 19 times,
while Elmira couldn’t keep its hands
on the ball either, racking up 27 turn-

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

overs

Canfield, found
relief in the play of the reserves,
namely sophomores Scott Alrutz, who
finished with four points, and Andrew
Manson. ‘‘I thought a couple of kids
came off the bench and played some
good, hustling, scrapping basketball,
and that’s Andy Scott." On
several occasions, Manson dove to
cover loose balls and knocked a ball
away from an Elmira player by diving
in the backcourt

Once again, sophomore — center
Chris Jacobs paced the Generals at
tack, finishing with 21 points and 12
rebounds. Classmates Mike Holton
and Craig Hatfield also had big games
with 19 and 18 points respectively
Senior captain Lee Brading chipped in
with 10.

For Elmira, seniors Rick Parker and
Bob Marko led the way. Parker
poured in a game-high 23 points,
while Marko notched 17 points and 13
boards.

In the final game of the tournament
on Saturday, the Generals played
Mount St. Mary, a 95-70 loser to
Elmira on Friday night. W&L got off
to an ominous start as the Knights
quickly scored the first eight points of
the game before Jacobs netted the first
W&L tally

The second match against Western

MIKE SHADY’
What the heck
is a Maroon?

There are several things that are easy to do in this world of ours.
Chewing gum and walking at the same time. Watching MTV’s ‘‘Remote
Control’. Watching that girl in the tight pants and cut-off shirt on
“Remote Control."* And, possibly, understanding all the fuss about
sororities coming to W&L (Nope. Scratch that. One can never
understand what THAT is all about.).

What most people would say it is definitely NOT easy to get very ex-
cited over a W&L athletic event. Who cares, anyway? Apathy abounds
here in the land of Polo shirts and BMW’s. Except when the dreaded
Roanoke Maroons come to town to face the Generals’ basketball team.

What's the big deal? What’s all the hubbub, bub? I mean, there aren’t
any huge cash prizes or trophies at stake, are there? It isn’t like
Louisville/Kentucky where a recruiting successes and woes hinge on the
outcome of the contest. And, by the way, what’s a Maroon?

Now this may seem silly and nonsensical to all you (y’all?) freshmen
and first-year attenders here at W&L. ‘‘It’s just a game!”’ you say.
‘‘Why should a meaningless basketball game be so important?”’

Well, it’s not like this little shindig just started yesterday. Seventy-
nine years ago in 1910 the Generals defeated the Maroons 119-5. (That
wasn't a misprint. Honest) The following year was almost as lopsided.
Final score: W&L 94, RC |. But the rivalry didn’t begin with these ear-
ly hardwood embarrassments.

No, the heat was most likely turned up during the 1979-80 season,
Roanoke’s first in Division III (The Maroons were previously a Division
II power). A year later, they joined the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference. The Generals weren't supposed to beat them. But they did. In
those two years of transition, three out of the four meetings W&L came
away with victory. A rivalry was born.

Generals’ head coach Verne Canfield sees THE GAME as the rich,
preppie kids (what other school wears ‘royal’ blue?) versus the blue col-
lar types. No argument here. None of the schools in the ODAC likes
W&L for the simple reason that we come from upper middle class
backgrounds while they don’t (except for maybe Hampden-Sydney, but
we'll save their story for another day). Nobody respects the wealthy, so
if you can’t beat them with the checkbooks then beat them with the jump
hooks.

What really makes this year’s game just that little extra special has
been the crowd support for this year’s team. Apathy? False. Already the
fans have brought meaning back to the words ‘thome court advan-
tage’’(the Generals are 6-0 at home this year) and one can only speculate
if the walls of the Warner Center (i.e. ‘‘Temple of Doom’’) will come
tumbling down tonight from the decibel level.

It’s not Dallas/Washington. It’s not Boston/L.A. It’s not even
Yale/Harvard. It is, however, our rivalry. And a good one at that.

NOTES—With Notre Dame back where it belongs, all seems serene in
today’s sports world. Not so. It seems that NC State did a little creative
compromising when it came to Mr. Chris Washburn’s grades. Ah well,
we can’t all maintain academic excellence... Please support the W&L
lacrosse team as well as the Generals’ basketball game tonight by pur-
chasing a *‘Terrible Towel’’ for a measly three bucks. The first 50
W&L students who enter the Warner Center tonight will receive one
free. See your local lacrosse player for details.

Generals had their first lead at 29-28.
MSM fought back behind Delor
Johnson's 18 first half points to lead
36-34, but Holton hit an off-balance
three-point goal from the corner at the
buzzer—his third trey of the half—to
send the Generals into the locker room
up 37-36.

In the second half, the Knight's
Derrick Brown scored 14 of his game-
total 15 points, including two that tied
the score at 65 with 4:47 left to play.
So the Generals again went to their
Mr. Consistency in the paint. Jacobs
responded with 22 second half points,
including nine of W&L’s last 14, and
gave the Generals the lead for good
with two free throws with 2:14 to
play. He finished with 26 points and
10 rebounds, leading the Generals to a
hard-fought 79-74 win.

Holton finished with 14, Brading

 

11, and sophomore forward Ed Hart
added 11. Johnson led MSM with 28
points and 12 rebounds.

“Our guys are showing a certain
poise at the end of the game, and if
they can do that now as sophomores,
then I’m excited to see what we can do
in two years,”’ said Canfield after the
Generals, 7-2, 3-0 in the Old Domi-
nion Athletic Conference, hit eight of
10 free throws in the final three
minutes to preserve the win.

Canfield was also pleased with the
crowd support, especially late in the
game. ‘‘I’m really pleased with that
crowd. There is nothing greater than
to hear a crowd start calling ‘defense’
when the score is tied. My hat is off to
the students supporting us like that.”’

The all-tournament team consisted
of Elmira’s Marko (41 points, 23
boards in two games), and Parker (41
points), MSM’s Johnson (48, 20), and
W&L’s Holton (33 points, 10-11 free
throws, 11 assists, seven 3-pt. goals)
and Most Valuable Player Jacobs (47,
22). wr ;

the only current General to play in that game. ‘The juniors
on that team were ecstatic. | was a freshman, and at that
time, I didn’t really know what the Roanoke game was all
about. But you could tell everyone thought it was a great
big thing to beat them. ”’

THE PAGEANTRY: Traditionally, Roanoke brings its
cheerleaders and a busload of students when it comes up
the road to Lexington, and generally, the W&L student
body has a surprise for them. A group of General sup
porters calling themselves the Unknown Fans—sporting
bags over their heads not unlike those worn by the old New
Orleans Aints’ fans—run around during time outs getting
the W&L faithful further involved in the game.

Will the Unknown Fans strike again this season? Said
one Unknown Fan, *‘We’ll try to get the wave going, read
newspapers during introductions, generally be loud and
obnoxious.”

 

Said Brading, ‘‘I think it’s great. As a player you look
forward to seeing what they will do. It's fun to watch, and
it makes playing the game more fun.”’

Said Canfield on the tradition, ‘‘I love ‘em. Great tra-
dition. I think it’s a nice, healthy situation, and I applaud
the people that do it, and am just sure to ask them to keep
everything in good taste. I would miss them if they weren't
here. I love them. I think it’s great, and I want Roanoke to
worry about the fact that the Unknown Fans are coming in.

THE PLACE: Lexington, Virginia. The Warner
Center. Sources close to the athletic department have
started a rumor that the Warner Center is about to undergo
a name change, mainly due to the fact that two preseason
conference favorites and the preseason fifth ranked team in
the nation have come to Lexington only to leave with their
rankings between their legs. The new name? The Temple
Of Doom. It has meant doom for every team that has come
to play here at W&L this season. ~

Holiday comedies surprise

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Christmas is by far the busiest
season for new films (with maybe the
exception of summer) and this year’s
Christmas was no exception churning
out film after film after film. While
the season wasn’t quite exceptional,
the films released were.

For the first time in some years,
most of the films released for the
Christmas holidays were met with
great reviews. The hilarious comedy
Twins starring Danny DeVito and Ar-
nold Schwarzeneggar, Working Girl
starring Harrison Ford, Melanie
Griffith and Sigourney Weaver, The
Naked Gun starring Leslie Nielsen
and Priscilla Presley and two new
animated films, The Land Before Time
from Don Bluth and Steven Spielberg
and Oliver and Company from Disney
helped lead the way to one of the best
box office takes in years.

There is no question, however, that
Mississippi Burning and Rain Man
were the finest two films released over
the holiday and the ones that will lead
this years group of films into the
Academy Award ceremonies in April.
I'll review the two films in the coming
weeks but this week I want to focus on
two of the season’s big comedy hits.

Bill Murray has been a little quiet
since Ghostbusters but not anymore.
His refreshed version of Dickens’ A
Christmas Carol called Scrooged is a
quality, light modernization on the old
story. Having been exposed to every
cinematic and television version of
Dickens’ story possible from an
animated version to a children’s ver-

you

sion to numerous film versions (and
having nightmares that the California
raisins might try to pull one off), I was
skeptical about seeing the film, but
was pleasantly surprised with the
result.

Murray gives a very
‘*Murrayesque”’ performance full of
the mannerisms, expressions and
vocalizations that have established
him as one of Hollywood’s biggest
comedig draws since he finished his
run on Saturday Night Live in the
70’s. Buster Poindexter and Carol
Kane are wonderful as the ghosts of
Christmas past and present and stand
out in what is an all-star cast including
Bob Goldthwait, John Forsythe,
Karen Allen, Mary Lou Retton, Alfre
Woodard, Robert Mitchum, Buddy
Hackett and John Houseman and Anne
Ramsey in what were their last film
appearances.

The story revolves around a cable
network executive (Murray) who has
worked his way to the top by looking
out for himself and stepping on
anyone in the way. His network has
plans to show a live version of A
Christmas Carol on Christmas Eve
using Hackett as Scrooge, Retton as
Tiny Tim and the Solid Gold dancers
as a chorus.

As Murray makes plans for the pro-
duction and gives his Christmas pre-
sent order to his secretary, ‘‘Towel,
towel, VCR (for the corporate
manager)’’ his life begins to assume
that of his production but like all
Scrooges, he never realizes that what
is happening is really happening to
him until the end.

Scroogedis very light and quite en-
joyable. It isn’t the best film of the
season, but for what it tried to ac-

complish, it succeeded with few
Humbugs from the critics.

TUG'S TAG - &&*®

Speaking of Ghostbusters stars who
need a little boost, how about Dan
Ackroyd? After the disastrous The
Great Outdoors this summer,
Ackryod was definitely asking Santa
for a successful Christmas and a suc-
cessful Christmas is what he got.

My Stepmother is an Alien has been
the surprise hit of the Christmas
season combining the talents of
Ackroyd, Jon Lovitz and Kim
Basinger; and oh, are they talented.

The film centers around Basinger
who comes to earth from a distant
galaxy to investigate a laser beam that
physicist Ackroyd sent accidently hit-
ting her galaxy. Basinger is sent to
find out why since Ackroyd was ap-
parently thousands of years ahead of
his time in sending the beam that far.

What ensues is a very funny and
refreshing romp through alien edu-
cation. Basinger comes equipped with
a purse called ‘‘bag’’ that knows
everything and can explain it to
Basinger when she _ encounters
something she doesn’t know such as
kissing, sex and marriage. Each of the
education scenes are incredibly funny
and very entertaining.

As for performances, all are ex-
cellent. Ackroyd pulls off his usual
geeky, intellectual, sexually deprived
character with ease and with style. He
continues to be, like Murray and many
of the others from the original Satur-
day Night Live, one of the finest com-
edians in film today. Ackroyd has that
rare ability to portray a character who

goes through life with reckless
disabandon without ever losing total
control.

If there is one comedian who is
coming into his own in film right now
it is Jon Lovitz. There is no question
that if someone is directing a film and
they have a part for the ultimate
cheeseball, Lovitz is the man. After
creating the characters such as the
agreeable man who says ‘‘yeah, that’s
the ticket’’ and the news correspon-
dent who urges the audience to ‘‘get to
know me’’ on the current Saturday
Night Live shows, Lovitz has put
himself in great demand. There is no
question, however, that this is his
finest film role to date. His scene at
the end of the film is priceless.

And while we are talking about
priceless, why not mention Kim
Basinger, one of the hottest properties
in Hollywood and definitely one of
the hottest actresses on the screen to-
day. This Athens, Georgia beauty has
come a long way since hitting
Hollywood in the seventies. Though
she has done numerous films she is
probably best remembered for her
part in 9 //2 Weeks opposite Mickey
O’Rouke; most especially the dance
scene in white. If you think that was
something, then don’t miss My Step-
mother is an Alien because she tops
her 9 //2 Weeks performance hands
down.

My Stepmother is an Alien will sur-
prise you. It doesn’t have the most in-
tricate or intelligent plot in the world
but it’s a cute film and one that has
more than enough laughs to justify the
$4 ticket price.
