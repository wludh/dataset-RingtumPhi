The long and winding political road
has reached its final destination with
George Bush continuing the Republi-
can legacy.

Vice President Bush, the expected
winner, took an early lead in the vot-
ing Tuesday and by 9 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time had been declared the
winner by the nation’s media.

According to the Associated Press,
Bush received 54 percent of the popu-
lar vote while Dukakis received 46
percent with 99 percent of the nation’s
precincts reporting.

More importantly however, Bush
rolled over Dukakis in the electoral

college; 40 states with 426 electoral
votes to 10 states with 112 electoral
votes. A candidate is declared the
winner after receiving 270 of the 538
electoral votes.

In Virginia, Bush collected 60 per
cent of the vote (1.3 million votes) to
Dukakis’ 40 percent (850,000). Bush
won all 12 precincts with his widest
margins of victory coming in the more
affluent precincts.

In an article by the Associated
Press, Bush revelled in his smashing
victory saying that his feelings ran
‘‘somewhere between total exhil-
aration and recognition that the chal-
lenge ahead is going to be awesome.””
Bush added ‘‘that his election was a
clear verdict and said he would work

Thefts from students’
cars are a problem

Two students were robbed of more
than $1000 after their cars were
broken into on Oct. 29th while both
cars were parked along Henry Street,
a Lexington police report said.

Burgess A. Thomasson, 22, of Mo-
bile, Ala., was robbed of $295 worth
of stereo equipment after someone
broke into his Ford Bronco II, the re-
port said. A Sherwood equalizer and
amplifier and a Sony portable radio
were stolen, the report said. Thomas-
son told police the crime occurred be-
tween 10:30 p.m. Saturday and 9:15

a.m. Sunday while the car was parked
at 110 E. Henry St.

Keyser Harris, 21, a student at Hol-
lins College, was robbed of an esti-
mated $775 worth of merchandise
after someone broke into her Isuzu
Trooper, the report said. Similar to
the break-in of Thomasson’s Bronco
II, someone broke the right vent
window of the Trooper and stole two
gold rings valued at $700 and a Kodak
35mm camera, the report said. Harris
told the police the crime happened be-
tween 11:30 p.m. Saturday and 9:00
a.m. Sunday while the car was parked
at 8 Henry St.

An auction of departmental office
furnishings, sponsored by University
Services, will take place this Saturday
at 10 a.m. in the student activities pa-
vilion.

Fontanne Bostic, who works for
University Services, said the doors
will open at 9 a.m. so buyers can look
over the selection of office furniture,

antiques, motor vehicles and other de-
partmental relics which are considered
obsolete now for university purposes.
At 10 a.m., Charlie Conner, the mail
room supervisor, will begin the auc-
tion.

Bostic said each item will be tagged
according to the department from
which it came so that the money ear-
ned from its sale can be given back to
that department. Bostic also said there
will be no selling of personal items
and no advanced sales.

Now that the long journey is over,
many in the U.S. are wondering if
Bush’s campaign promises will re-
main intact. In a news conference
Wednesday afternoon, Bush attemp-
ted to shed some light on his future
presidential plans, On taxes, he re-
iterated that his anti-tax stand will
hold saying, ‘‘I’m talking about hold-
ing the line on taxes and I don’t plan to
deviate and I think the American peo-
ple must have understood that.””

In the realm of judicial appoint-
ments, Bush said that ‘‘he has no lit-
mus test for the Supreme Court or
other judicial appointments he will

said that he didn’t want to name
anyone to the court who would legis-
late from the bench.*’ It is expected
that Bush will have the opportunity to
appoint at least two Supreme Court
justices in the next four years.

At Wednesday's news conference
Bush also appointed james A. Baker
III to be secretary of state during his
administration and chief of staff Craig
Fuller and senior campaign advisor
Bob Teeter as co-directors of Bush’s
transition into office.

Bush is expected back in Washing-
ton early today in order to consult
with President Reagan on the first
steps of his presidency.

It's a funny thing the way the
seasons change so quickly. It seems
like most of the leaves fall in single
night. I never notice the change until
they are all gone and only the empty
branches are left. At that point, the li-
brary gets a little noisier as people be-
gin the final grind to make up for all
those afternoons outside.

But wait a minute, don’t despair -
you don’t have to go to the library yet.
Hunting season is here, and
Rockbridge County is home to some
of the finest hunting in this part of the
country.

The George Washington National
Forest runs right through the county,
offering more than a million acres of
prime hunting land. There are also
thousands of acres of private land in
the area to hunt on - just be sure to ask
first.

The season opened for turkey, ruf-

fed grouse, rabbit and squirrel on
November 7 and will remain open un-
til January. Deer season opens
November 21 and closes December 3
in this county, which only leaves one
week after Thanksgiving break for
those of us who are leaving. Hunters
are allowed two deer this season,
which must be antlered bucks, except
for the last two days when either sex
may be hunted.

Now, it’s not like Alabama or Texas
around here; you can not pick and
choose, but with good scouting,
patience, and a touch of luck, you can
still be successful. There is also hunt-
ing for raccoon, opossum, fox, bob-
cat, and even bear!

Deer hunting is the pursuit that
brings the most hunters to the woods.
Unfortunately, this popularity on oc-
casion creates a dangerous situation
when there are too many hunters too
close together. Each year hunters are
accidentally shot when this happens.
Consequently, the Virginia Depart-
ment of Game and Inland Fisheries

 

has created two laws to increase
safety: mandatory hunter safety edu-
cation and mandatory blaze orange
during firearm deer season.

The hunter safety requirement is for
young hunters and for those who have
never been issued a hunting license to
help ensure that everyone in the
woods knows the safe and responsible
use of his firearm. The last hunter
safety classes of the season are being
offered at the Airport Holiday Inn in
Roanoke on Nov. 12- 13. Call the
Game Dept. at (703)983-7704 for de-
tails.

The second safety rule requires that
hunters wear blaze orange visible
from 360 degrees during deer season,
so that you won’t get your buddy
mixed up with a deer or some other
critter coming down the trail.

Hunter McCoy at the Shootist (now
McCoy’s Sports Center), suggested
the Goshen of the Little North Moun-
tain Wildlife Management Areas near
Goshen as a good area to hunt, but

there are many others as well. The
Pedlar Ranger Station in Buena Vista
has an excellent map of the area for
$1, as well as more detailed topogra-
phic maps of $2.50. Both McCoy and
the rangers are extremely helpful and
would be happy to answer any further
questions.

I have hunted all my life and found
it to be a very rewarding pastime,
having gained a great appreciation for
the animals and the wild places in the
world. I realize, however, that hunt-
ing is not for everyone. I can re-
member countless times when I have
sat at the bottom of a tree, shivering

for hours in the morning frost with
numb fingers and toes, or when my
dog had run off to chase some rabbit
and I had to crawl in the snow through

the thickest tangle of briars imagina-
ble to retrieve my own bird and I had
thoughts of a warm room somewhere.
I guess that sometimes I have wished
for a moment that I had gone to the li-
brary. But only for a moment.

The Executive Committee voted
Monday night to require that all tran-
scripts of closed honor trials be retur-
ned to the EC after the student body
hearing is completed so the EC may
destoy the transcripts.

Transcripts of a closed honor trial
are given to the accused, his advo-
cates, the EC and the President of the
Student Bar Association, who acts as
chair for a student body hearing, if the
accused decides to have a student
body hearing.

EC President Christopher de-
Movellan said the EC decided to re-
vise the White Book "because there
was nothing that said those transcripts
had to be turned back."

Third-Year Law EC Rep. Dave
Nave drafted three revisions which
can go into effect only after a secon-
dary EC vote next week, which is re-
quired to approve changes in the
White Book. s

In the White Book, Part III "Proce-
dure for Honor System Hearings by
the Executive Committee of the Stu-
dent Body," section A, sub-section
two (page six) will now read: "Fina-
lly, the accused will be reminded that
he or she does not have to testify in
either this hearing or a subsequent
Student Body Hearing. The accused
shall also be told that the testimony
given during the course of the hear-
ing, including that of the accused,
shall be recorded.

If the Executive Comrmrittee finds
that the accused has violated the
Honor System and he or she subse-
quently requests a Student Body
Hearing, then the accused, his or her
advocates, the EC, and the Chair may
have this recording transcribed solely
for use at that hearing. The accused,
his or her advocates, the EC advo-
cates, and the Chair shall turn over
any and all transcripts derived from
this recording to the EC immediately
following the hearing. The EC will
then destroy these transcripts."

Under the "Procedure for a Student
Body Hearing," Part IV (page 15), a
section K will be added to read: "Im-
mediately following the hearing, the
accused, his or her advocates, the EC
advocates, and the Chair shall turn
over any and all transcripts derived
from the recording made at the Exe-
cutive Committee Hearing to the EC.
The EC will then destroy these tran-
scripts."

A third revision that does not deal
directly with transcripts will be put
into effect at the same time. In the
third sentence of section O, which
stipulates confidentiality guidelines,
under Part III "Procedure for Honor
System Hearings by the Executive

Staff Report

 

Lexington City Council will decide
this fall whether or not to place a per-
sonal property tax on W&L and VMI
student vehicles.

The tax would affect students living
in the city. A student paying a per-
sonal property tax at home would have
to pay the difference between his
home tax and Lexington’s tax.

Lexington’s personal property tax is

5.5%. If, for example, a student pays
a 4% personal property tax at home,
he would have to pay the 1.5%
difference to Lexington. If the stu-
dent’s home town does not charge a
personal property tax, the student
would have to pay Lexington’s full
property tax assessment.

At Lexington’s ‘‘Town, Gown and
Coatee’’ meeting this past Tuesday,
City Council members discussed the
problem that students are not sharing

Committee of the Student Body," the
word "will" is to be changed to
"may." Therefore, section O will now
read: "For example, the accused, any
student interviewed in an_ in-
vestigation, or any witness in an Exe-
cutive Committee Hearing may be
placed on social or conduct probation
or suspended from the Universi-
ty.’’ DeMovellan said if anyone has
questions or suggestions about the
above amendments to the White
Book, they should see an EC member
before next week’s meeting, when
these changes will be put into effect.

In other business, Junior EC Rep.
Jud Parker and Freshman EC Rep.
Clayton Kennington will look into
possible solutions for the complaints
that the EC has received about dogs
on campus.

DeMovellan said that he has heard
student concern about the presence of
dogs without leashes running around
on the campus. Kennington and Par-
ker will meet with Dean of Students
Lewis G. John and report back to the
EC on Monday.

In other business, the Men’s Vol-
leyball Club was granted a budget al-
location of $1,024. DeMovellan said
that the club "had a lot of interest and
a lot of leadership."

The Ariel’s budget was frozen
temporarily at the meeting because
the group did not post flyers at the
law school.

The Independent Union, Interna-
tional Club, Minority Student Asso-
ciation, Student Activities Board and
Trident all gave budget reports at the
mecting. The EC reported all the
above organizations as financially
stable.

Parker was late and Junior EC Rep.
Chris Giblin was given an excused
absence. The meeting lasted one hour
and 40 minutes.

the cost for the city services they use
with Lexington residents. Tax paying
citizens must compete with students
for available parking.

The city would face the difficulty of
finding the cars and the owners. The
Commissioner of Revenue, Courtney
Baker, contacted other towns and ci-
ties where colleges and universities
are located. Most of them responded
that locating the cars and students for
the tax was ‘‘worth the trouble’.

'88-'89 Registers are in Reid Hall

 

By Heather M. Midkiff
Staff Reporter

 

The student directories are
available at the Registrar’s office.

The directories, which contain per-
tinent information on the telephone
numbers, of students, faculty (both at
home and the office), fraternities and
dorm hall numbers are free for all stu
dents.

The directories are to be used be the

now

students instead of the Student Infor
mation Number, which has been
abused in the past

According to a memo written by

Lewis G. John, dean of students,
‘*The purpose of Student Information
is to provide information on how to

reach a student by phone or mail after

efforts in consulting either the current
register of faculty, staff and students,
the Lexington telephone book or the
Washington and Lee telephone direc
tory have failed. The message center
will contact students in case of emer
gency and make a reasonable effort to
reach a student if personal, depart
mental or staff efforts have failed
However, the primary responsibility
to contact a student lies with the ini
tiating party, as the message center
serves as a backup system. ””

Carol Ann Calkins, who is in
charge of Student Informa
tion/Message Center, says there have
been many instances of students call
ing the number when it was not neces
sary.

She also said, ‘*The student Infor
mation Number is manned by work
study students who are only here from
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. There is no one here
to answer the phone during evenings
or weekends.”’

Tax on Cars?

OPINION

 

WA&L students may soon see more money coming out of their
checkbooks in next year’s matriculation line.

Lexington is considering imposing a tax on vehicles owned by
W&L and VMI students who live in the city. If the measure is
passed, students could be paying as much as 5% percent of the
value of their car per year. In dollars and cents that translates into a
$990 tax on an $18,000 car.

Granted, not all student cars are worth $18,000, but a 5'4 percent
tax is nonetheless a substantial sum of money for any student to pay
to drive a car in Lexington for a year.

However, the city does have a legitimate reason for imposing a
tax on student cars (though not necessarily at the 5'2percent rate).
Lexington has a weak tax base and needs revenue to provide ser-
vices to city residents — students included. Those revenues help
pay to clean the streets of garbage and snow as well as help pay the
salaries of the policemen who ticket student cars.

Since students are not permanent residents of Lexington, they

: * receive these services for free. State law allows localities to charge

college students the difference between what students pay in per-
sonal property taxes at home, and what they would pay if they were

' citizens of the college town. Therefore, students living in localities

with a personal property tax rate lower than Lexington’s 5% per-
cent would be required to pay the difference. Since Lexington has
the highest personal property tax rate in Virginia, there will be a
difference to be paid, at least for in-state student car owners.
Lexington Mayor Buddy Derrick said in a News- Gazette article
last week that taxpaying citizens must vie with students for available

'+ parking in Lexington, yet the students are not sharing the burden of
_ * funding the city services they use, such as traffic control and street
;., Maintenance.

The vehicle tax is a fair tax — students should help pay for the
city services they use. But a reasonable rate not relative to vehicle
value would be a better alternative. It would alleviate the money

.« crunch on students and make it easier on town officials if everyone
' » has to pay the same price.

MY VIEW

: By Jon Sbar

 

The day was Monday October 31,

: 1988. My planned agenda for the
‘ evening included figuring out what

happened to the dinosaurs, writing a
‘novel, and deciding if God really
’ exists. But, suddenly, I was in Ancient
: China eating lunch with Ghangis Khan
-(note: I was having an out-of-body
experience). ‘‘Fred’’ (Khan’s nick-
name) told me to go trick-or-treating
so I finished dessert, paid my bill, and
came back to my body.

Immediately, I called up a few
friends from the neighborhood and
they said I could tag along. Then I
‘turned to the problem of a costume. I
thought about going as a transvestite
from the third moon of Jupiter, but
decided it was too mundane. I wanted
something different, something dar-
ing, something my 11-year-old friends
would remember: I wanted to be
«Charles Manson.

The door bell rang - my friends
were ready. One was Godzilla and the
,other was Mother Theresa. We were
in a big hurry. It was already 6 p.m.
-and we had to be in by 9 p.m. Armed
with pillow cases for candy, and flu-
orescent lightsticks for crossing the
street, we attacked the neighborhood.

: After the first couple of hours I real-
: ized something was wrong. As soon as
: homeowners saw me they got stingy. I
' was getting sugar-free sucking candy
: while Mother Theresa was raking in

: quarter-pound chocolate bars. Even if

‘I was the only trick- or-treater in the
‘country with a driver’s license, it still

H:L.R.

A Night with Charles
‘Manson and Friends

wasn’t fair. I didn’t want to admit it,
but deep in my heart I knew it was my
Charles Manson costume. For centur-
ies, Halloween bigots have rewarded
good characters like Mother Theresa
while persecuting evildoers like me
and Jack-the-Ripper. I was sorry to
see the ugly head of discrimination
reared on a sacred holiday like Hal-
loween. Besides, it was cutting into
my candy profits. To make up for
these losses, I needed a costume
change and I needed it quick (it was
almost 9 p.m.). I decided to be
Ghandi. In a matter of minutes, I stole
a white robe and shaved my head. Bi-
got homeowners responded generous-
ly to this positive character, stuffing
my pillowcase with blank checks and
Swedish chocolates. By 8:30 I had
enough candy to retire on. I knew that
I should have gone home but I
couldn’t stop. I was infected. I had to
have more candy.

Against the better judgment of God-
zilla and Mother Theresa, I stayed out
past curfew. By now it was 10:45 and
I was a few blocks from my house.
Turning a corner, I froze in my tracks.
Less than ten feet away from me was a
pack of big kids (12 or 13). They were
armed (with shaving cream and eggs),
hostile and dangerous. I had to hide.
Where? The bushes. Too late, they
see me. I turned and ran for home but
my bag was too heavy to stay out in
front. Like a pack of hungry hyenas
chasing an antelope, they dragged me
down. They snared my loot and
cracked eggs in my shoes. I was left
with nothing but a white robe and a
shaved head.

The moral of this story is obvious:
If you go trick-or- treating next year,
carry a concealed hand gun.

Ignorance of International Politics

 

MY VIEW
By Julia Kirk

 

On Monday I asked twenty-five
people ten questions about the ‘inter-
national political scene.’ This article
will be devoted to recounting their an-
swers.

The first question concerned
France. I asked for the name of the
president, his political party, and the
name of the prime minister. Eighteen
people knew that Francois Mitterand
was the president, seventeen knew
that he was a socialist. No one knew
the prime minister’s name, although
seven mistakenly believed that Chirac

MY VIEW
By Elizabeth Parkins

 

In the waning hours of the morning
I sit here attempting to come up with a
suitable topic for a My View this
week. The last two I conjured up were
vetoed over-whelmingly by both my
roommate and the boy who lives up-
stairs.

‘*Too mushy, sentimental, that stuff
should be saved for the end of the year
when it really means something,”
they both said.

So, into the garbage can they went
(well, actually I kept a copy for future
reference) and I still had no My View.

still held the post. Question number
two is an embarrassment to us all. One
(!!!) person knew the current president
of Mexico’s name (congratulations to
Christopher deMovellan). No one
knew the president-elect’s name.

My third question, ‘‘Who is the
president of South Africa?’’ met with
mixed success. Thirteen people knew
that Botha was president, one believed
that Tutu was chief executive, and
eleven didn’t know. Question number
four asked for the name of El Salva-
dor’s president; nine people knew it,
sixteen people did not. The fifth ques-
tion, ‘‘Who is the president of Nicara-
gua?’’ was a disappointment given
U.S. involvement in that country.
Only thirteen people knew that Ortega
occupied the post, three thought that
Noriega did, and nine didn’t know.

One thing did strike me however,
and on the suggestions of several
friends, I would like to expound on the
work of several of my classmates. My
freshman year several girls got
together and decided that a women’s
soccer team was needed. So in the
cold, dark hours of a January night the
two ran from dorm to dorm gathering
the needed signatures to form a team.
All-in-all they came up with a list of
15 girls.

Coach Piranian was soon enlisted to
help and come spring, the team started
practicing. There was a considerable
increase in participants though, with
28 women coming out to the field. In
the days when there were only 100
women here, this 28 percent was sig-
nificant.

Four years and a coach later, the

When asked, ‘‘Who is Yitzhak .

Shamir?’’ eleven people responded
correctly, three held misconceptions
about his identity (one believed he was
the ‘‘head of the PLO’’), and six
didn’t know. Question number eight
queried, ‘‘Who is Juan Carlos?’’ Nine
people knew, three believed he played
pro-baseball, one believed he was a
Colombian coffee bean pickler, one
believed he was an international terro-
rist, and eleven didn’t know.

The question, ‘‘Who was Tito’’
garnered twelve correct responses,
eight ‘no clues’, and four incorrect
answers including, ‘‘Dorothy’s dog,’’
“‘an Argentinean dictator,’’ and *‘Mi-
chael Jackson’s older brother.’’ The
final question, ‘‘What nation political-
ly and economically supports Soma-
lia?’’ received eight correct answers,

eight incorrect answers, seven ‘‘no
clues’’ and eighteen ‘‘Where the hell’s
Somalia?’’s. ‘
Four people refused to answer the
survey on the basis of political illitera-
cy. The most common response was,
“‘Are you trying to show how ignorant
I am?’’ but ‘‘Who cares about this’
crap anyway,’’ ran a close second,
“*Yeah, well what do you know about
finance?”’ was a distant third. :
To those among you who know the:
answers to the above questions I offer
my congratulations, you seem to be ah

rarity here at W&L. To those, who in. \

reading this article find they have ‘no
clue’ who Juan Carlos is, I suggest‘
that you put down your USA Today ,
Life, or Sports section and pick up the
Washingtion Post or New York '
Times.

Opportunities

team is considered a growing power-
house. Six players have won post
season honors in two of ODAC com-
petition and this year W&L sported
the premier ODAC coach when Jan
Hathorn was named Coach-of-the-
Year. °

So what? The point is, coeducation
has worked in many ways that are just
beginning to come to a fruition. In the
last several years the Class of ’89 has
somehow been lost in the shuffle. In-
creasing enrollment standards have
brought gifted, enthusiastic students
who come to this campus with many
programs already in place. (That’s not
to say that when we got here there
were no programs, it’s just that with
new women at W&L some things
needed to change.) Both men and
women helped to form many neces-

sary organizations and groups.

It is necessary then, to remember
those students who have spent man’
hours organizing and building. Bu.
more importantly, the students who
follow the Class of ’89 must continue
to contribute to the University. They
will be able to expand and create new *
opportunities for both themselves and
the students to follow. Washington
and Lee is ever evolving and it is up to
the students to see that it does not
stagnate.

Well, as for the team, soccer is over
forever now for those original Class

of ’89 members. The rest of the team '

sent us off with much (appreciated)
fanfare and yes, some sadness. But |

look to them with trust to continue the »

traditions that we have started.

An abundance of time to meet and
come to know fellow students, facul-
ty, ideas and experiences in an excit-
ing environment of intellectual, physi-
cal and social interaction

C. Barritt:

I remember Pearl Harbor, I remember
only 13 of us were not fraternity
members.
Howard Boetsch:

The sharp awareness about issues
beyond W&L which overtook the
campus during those years.

William Buchanan:
Putting the Ring-tum Phi to bed.

Daniel Coffey:

I must be a traditionalist because I was
very pleased to receive a quality edu-
cation at the university from which my
father and grandfather also graduated.
My favorite extracurricular activity
was singing in the Glee Club under the
expert direction of Gordon Spice.

Jay Cook:

1. World War I effects

2. Friends made in fraternity, sports
and classes

3. Stimulating and friendly instructors
4. University and fraternity dances

5. -etc.

Sydney Coulling:

Impact of World War II; friendships;
everything under Fitz Flournoy; stu-
dent honor, civility; dances, football;
Colonnade; Francis Pendleton
Gaines.

James Farrar, Jr.:

The lasting friendship made with both
fellow students and faculty. I re-
member having new areas of interest
opened to me by energenic and en-
thusiastic faculty.

Marshall Follo:
Friends, teachers, learning to pay at-
tention to words.

John Gunn:

My strongest sense of Washington and
Lee over 47 years’ observation is the
essential continuity of the things that
matter most.

Patrick Hinely:

That during my tenure as a student,
frat membership fell under the 50%
mark (of the total student body) for the
only time since WW II . That students
voted in favor of coeducation. That
Nixon won the student poll but
McGovern carried the faculty poll.
That the general feeling was that
Watergate was a minor foible which
the Nix would squirm his way out of.
That I didn’t expect this school to be-
come coeducational in my lifetime. It
still amazes me. I’m glad I came back.

William Holmes:

Great friends. Great times. Life on the
farm. Rosehill. Sleeping in. Team
competition. Soccer. Division I La-

der.

Marshall Jarrett:

Studying with outstanding teachers,
working and playing with wonderful
friends in one of the most beautiful
places on earth.

giving the keynote address.

ing teachers, strong and loyal W&L
men.

The wisdom and strength of Dean Gil-
liam.

My four years of Varsity Baseball.

John McDaniel:

Professor James G. Leyburn’s incom
parable classes, Coach Lee McLaugh
lin’s leadership on the athletic field,
the quiet dignity of President Fred
Cole and Bob (Murph) Murray's vain
attempts to beat me in handball.

David McLeod:

How at home I felt at W&L being able
to talk to the deans and the president
of the university. I don’t think I could
have gone to another school
where the president knew me well
enough to call me up and ask me to
play ping-pong with him.

ever

William McHenry:

The excitement on campus when our
football team upset nationally ranked
(Sth) Virginia 42-14 in 1951.

Timothy McMahon:

Junior year I turned someone in for an
Honor Violation; he went public, and
testifying was difficult considering the
consequences. Still, that day was the
first time I knew what it meant to be a
part of this university.

Lex McMillan:

Warm days, cold nights, loud music,
gifted teachers, new knowledge, old
wisdom, rapid changes, foolish mis-
takes, forgiveness, encouragement
and love.

Holt Merchant:

The opportunity to study with a num-
ber of talented and dedicated teachers.
The two men who had the greatest in-
fluence on me were Olliger Crenshaw
and Allen Moger. They showed me
why I loved history, they encouraged
me to continue my work beyond
W&L, and they made it possible for
me to have a life in academics. I could
never thank these men enough for
what they have done for me.

‘W&L faculty alumni reminisce about undergrad. days

The strength and importance of the
Honor System, the dedication of the
faculty across all disciplines, and the
consistently high quality of the in-
struction in my major area, the Eng-
lish Department

Frank Parsons:
uneven faculty quality
-easy Phi Beta Kappa
-only 1,000 students
respect for Dean Gilliam
the honor system worked
-no jeans

Rolf Piranian:

People- Professors, coaches, other
special people of the W&L commun-
ity, and especially friendships.
Experiences- Athletics,
exams, social life.

papers,

Edgar Spencer:

My first view of the colonnade the
night I arrived in Lexington from Ar-
kansas; hikes in the country; fellow
students who will remain lifelong
friends; a few teachers who changed
my views of the world I knew and in-
troduced me to worlds I did not know
existed.

Mike Stachura:

So much happens over four years, it’s
hard to point to one isolated event. But
when graduation day came and Presi-
dent Wilson mentioned my name in
his remarks at graduation, I guess I
had the feeling that I had accompli-
shed something in my four years here,
other than earn a degree. It made me
feel good to know that I had been a
part of this institution.

Sarah Wiant:

I remember most the faculty’s support
of my endeavors and their willingness
to talk with me about any problem,
academic or personal.

vices and reference librarian at Wash-
‘ington and Lee University, served as a
contributing writer for an American

4 ‘government textbook, We the People,

,

published this month by Holt, Rine-
hart and Winston.

Hays wrote the historical essays that
are included as special features in each
chapter of the text to help students bet-

+ ter understand why government has

grown and changed. The essays cover
such diverse topics as women’s suf-

« frage, the McCarthy era and citizen-

ship for native Americans.
In addition to writing the essays,

« Hays served as a reader and consultant

for the manuscript, specifically to in-

¢ clude more material on women and

minorities.

In 1987, Hays co-authored We Are
One, a government textbook pub-
lished by Coronado Publishers. She
also served as content specialist for
the text.

Hays, who joined the Washington
and Lee faculty in 1983, received her
bachelor of science degree in political
science from the University of Chat-
tanooga, and M.A. and A.B.D. de-
grees in history from the University of

WA&L trivia
answered

By Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

 

 

Answers to last week’s trivia:

The Egyptian God Anubis is found
on a mural in the Commerce School.

W&L’s first professor of penman-
ship and bookkeeping was Professor
C.M. Koones.

The *‘Ranches’’ were old apartment
houses where students lived on Pres-
ton St. and in Red Square when there
were no fraternities.

The Commerce School was first re-
ferred to as ‘‘The School for Graft’’
between 1903-1905.

The ‘‘calics’’ were local girls.

Newspapers across the country
falsely reported that the Natural
Bridge burned down in 1873.

W&L’s women’s singing group, Jubilee, entertains a crowd in Lee Chapel last weekend as part of the 34th annual Parent’s

Weekend.

By Henry Ferris
Staff Reporter

 

At 4:07 on Tuesday afternoon a
gunshot sent almost 200 members of
the student body into a wild dash
across the law school fields. Less than
twenty minutes later, junior David
Martin broke alone from the woods to
easily win the annual Washington and
Lee Turkey Trot.

“It was pretty tough, especially the
last hill,’ Martin said of the women’s
five kilometer cross-country course on
which the race took place. A member
of the Washington and Lee indoor and
outdoor track teams, Martin credited
his victory to his training for the 1500
and 3000 meter events which he will

run this spring. His time of 19 minutes
and seven seconds was over a minute
faster than the second place finisher,
sophomore Bruce Taylor. Law 1 rep-
resentative JohnJohnson placed third.

Not all who ran the 3.1 mile course
through the mountains and along the
Maury River were in the race to win
it. One participant called his finish a
“‘moral victory,’’ although he had
been forced to walk portions of the
course due to an upset stomach. All of
the racers were cheered on by mem-
bers of the varsity cross-country teams
who were placed along the course to
watch and direct the runners through
the rugged terrain.

After the last finisher had crossed
the line, the results were taken back to

the intramural office where they were
tabulated. The Turkey Trot is a major
event on the schedule for the fall in-
tramural season. After tabulating the
number of participants and the finish-
ing times, Law 1 received 100 points
for winning the overall race. Sigma
Alpha Epsilon was second, gaining 95
points, and Phi Delta Theta finished
third, accumulating 90 points.

When it was over, most of the 173
finishers seemed winded but happy
that the race was over for another
year. Sophomore Gary Maxa summed
up the event for most of the competi-
tors by saying, ‘After this race, you
realize how out of shape you really
are.

Freshmen create
new hall lounge

By Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

 

should be resurrected into a viable en-
tertainment center.

The lounge contains a television
mounted on a stand with a small couch
and a chair providing seating capacity
for three. According to Joy, it costs
about $300 to furnish the room, half
of which came from a $2000 fund for
freshmen activities. The other half
came difectly from the pockets of the
twenty guys living on the hall where
the room would be located.

Freshmen Steve Ross said, ‘‘Ever-
yone gave about eight bucks. I think
the television room is a good idea for
people who don’t have a TV or
cable.’’ That comment typifies the
support the room has among those
who repose there. Scott Miller, an-
other freshmen, said, ‘‘It gives me
something to do between classes when
I don’t have any work.”’

However, Ross did voice one com-
plaint: ‘‘The room the lounge is in a
way too small. It only seats three peo-
ple comfortably." Miller raised an-
other problem. ‘‘Often there will be
people there who haven’t contributed
any money.’’ But Miller stressed that
people who did pay would not banish
anyone from the lounge for that
reason.

In the last few years, the admissions
department at Washington and Lee
has made a conscious effort to recruit
and enroll the brightest students avail-
able from across the country. No
doubt at some point in their prep-
aration for college these students were
indoctrinated with the wisdom the ear-
liest settlers have passed down to us,
such as the old adage, ‘‘Necessity is
the mother of invention.’ Rest as-
sured that the residents of the fourth
floor of Graham-Lees who live on
Dorm Counselor Ed Joy’s hall were
well prepared, and learned that prov-
erb properly. When they were faced
with the problem that many freshmen
know all too well; plenty of leisure
time and no television set to squander
it in front of, they put that old lesson
to work, banding together and raising
money to convert an old storage room
into a television lounge for them-
selves.

Joy said, ‘‘Everyone on the hall said
they wanted a television room. They
came to me and I went to Dean Rus-
cio.’’ Ruscio agreed with Joy and the
freshmen that the empty storage room

Politics Flick

The Washington and Lee Film
Society is pleased to announce its
next presentation, ‘‘Rosa Luxem-
burg’’ (West Germany, 1985), dir-
ected by Margarethe von Trotta.

Showings will be at 8:00 p.m. on
Friday November 11 and Saturday
November 12 in Lewis Hall Class-
room ‘‘A.’’ There is no charge for
admission. The film is in German
and Polish, with subtitles.

Director Von Trotta (‘*Marianne
and Juliane,’ ‘‘Lost Honor of
Katherina Blum,’’ and others) pre-
sents a sweeping portrayal of the
life and times of Rosa Luxemburg,
‘Red Rosa,’’ one of the most
extraordinary political figures of
this century. Barbara Sukowa de-
livers a wonderful performance as
the woman whose very active pol-
itical career included opposition to
the czarist government in Russian
Poland, revolutionary opposition
within Germany to the German
government during World War I,
and a role as one of the most
powerful and persuasive propon-
ents of radical politics on the inter-
national scere.

ing thanks and Robert E. Lee’s de-
dication to Christianity. The main
focus of the evening , however,
will be when the floor is opened up
and the audience is encouraged to
share what they are personally
thankful for. The event is being
sponsored by a student fellowship
group. It is designed to bring the
town, the faculty and the students

Another W&L student was robbed
of more than $3,500 worth of personal
belongings on Oct. 29th after someone
broke into his house at 7 Tucker St., a
Lexington police report said.

Allen Thomas McConnell, 21, of
Dallas, Texas, told police that
someone entered his house between
10:30 p.m. Saturday and 1 a.m. Sun-
day and stole several things from his
living room, the report said. Among

the articles stolen were a Rolex watch,
a VCR, and $40 cash, the report said.
McConnell said everything stolen was

in the living room.
The report said the thief probably

walked in the front or back door since

neither doors were locked and no
traces of forced entry were found.

No suspects have been found.

‘Weekend victory over Ursinus Satur-
) day on Wilson Field.

» The Grizzlies (2-7) scored on a
20-yard interception return by line-
backer Todd Klinedinst just four

,minutes into the game and picked off

‘another Sampson pass six minutes
jlater. But sophomore slotback Carl
‘Gilbert sizzled the Grizzlies’ defense
}for a 44-yard touchdown reception be-
tween the two Sampson turnovers,
and Carter Quayle’s extra point with
,7:18 left in the opening period proved
‘to be the difference.

The Generals (4-3-1) would add a
(32-yard Quayle field goal in the fourth

uarter, but Ursinus turnovers and
theavy rain in the second half com-
bined with a strong W&L defensive
effort to keep the Ursinus offense
‘scoreless and assure the Generals of a
‘record no lower than .500 for the first
hime since 1985.
+ Ursinus took the opening kickoff
but moved the football only 22 yards
before punting to the W&L 15. Senior

ilback Tony Waskiewicz picked up
Five yards on two plays before Kline-

, dinst stepped in front of a Sampson

pass, and the Ursinus linebacker raced
into the endzone untouched.

Dave Lockhart came on to kick the
extra point, and the W&L defense
blocked his point after. But there were
12 Generals on the field, and the
half-the-distance-to-the-goal-line pen-
alty gave Ursinus coach Steve Gilbert
all the incentive he needed to go for
two.

‘*He had two kicks blocked earlier
in the season against Catholic Univer-
sity,’’ said W&L coach Gary Fallon,
‘so, early in the game, he probably
was willing to take a chance.”

But Ursinus running back Joe Zir-
polo was stopped short of the goal
line, and the Grizzlies’ lead was held
to six.

And it wouldn’t last long. The Gen-
erals drove 84 yards in nine plays, but
they needed only one play for the last
44 —the Sampson TD pass to Gilbert.

‘‘Carl had him [the Ursinus defen-
der] beat even on a dry field,’’ said
Fallon, ‘‘and when their guy slipped
in the mud, he really had him beat.’

Quayle’s extra point would be all
the scoring W&L needed. The Gen-
erals allowed Ursinus across _ their
20-yard line only once all day, and the
Grizzlies never crossed the W&L 10.

The Generals were also helped by
four Ursinus turnovers. Quarterback
Brian Thomas maintained his two
interceptions per game average,
thanks to a little help from W&L de-
fensive backs Bobby Rimmer and
Brad Miller, and the Generals re-

covered two Ursinus fumbles.

Rimmer, a junior, ended a 59-yard
Ursinus drive in the second quarter
when he picked off a Thomas pass in
the end zone. Then, after a punt by
senior Tom Skeen gave Ursinus the
ball back, W&L defensive tackle Jim
Johnson sacked Thomas and knocked
the ball loose, and senior tackle
Hughes Melton recovered for the
Generals.

When it rains, it pours, and it rained
heavily in the second half Saturday —
and all of it fell on the Grizzlies. A
third-quarter fumble by Thomas was
recovered by W&L sophomore free
safety Clark Wight, and Miller, a jun-
ior, intercepted a Thomas pass to halt
the Grizzlies’ final drive of the game.

HASHMARKS— W&L has won
four of its last five games and is 4-1-1
in its last six. A victory in their season
finale against Washington University
(2-7) Saturday in St. Louis would give
the Generals their first winning season
since 1985, when W&L was 7-2....
The Grizzlies netted only 58 yards of
offense in the second half.... The
W&L defense has allowed only 32
points in five straight games and only
42 in its last six.... Skeen, one of
W&L’s two starting linebackers,
made 14 tackles Saturday and 60 in
W&L’s last four games. Junior Mike

Sunday will be a day that the Wash-
ington and Lee water polo team would

 

just as soon forget. The Generals’
worst scenario came true. W&L had a
bad day in the pool while the Univer-
sity of Arkansas-Little Rock Trojans
were playing a great game. These two
factors resulted in a 14-6 loss for the
Generals and a Southern League
Championship for the Trojans.

The game started off on the wrong
foot for W&L as the Generals fell be-
hind 2-0 halfway into the first quarter.
Once the Generals were on the down
side of the scoreboard they were never
able to recover. The Trojans contin-
ued their barrage of scoring and led
after the first half 7-1.

It was obvious at this point that the
Generals needed to score almost every
time they had the ball in the second
half but when Arkansas scored first
early in the third quarter the game
was, for the most part, decided.

The Trojans moved the ball with
precision and quickness that seemed to
overwhelm the Generals from the very
start. Arkansas was getting a good
shot almost every time they had pos-
session. This was the difference in the
game. W&L was unable to make any
progress against a tough Arkansas de-

fense. The Generals’ typical posses-
sion was one or two passes, then a
turnover or a bad shot.

The Generals’ poor play was a re-
sult of Arkansas distracting them early
in the game. The Trojans came out
playing very physically and the effect
seemed to work in their favor. This
rough play had a couple of players
concentrating on revenge instead of
water polo.

‘**A couple of our guys were out

Trojans roll past W&L ©
in league polo finals

there head hunting instead of playing ~
water polo. We lost our composure {
due to the type of game the officials al- .

lowed Arkansas to play. Their offi-
ciating complemented their style of
game,”’ said head coach Page Remil-
lard.

The Generals will now move on to

the Eastern Championships that will.
be held at Brown University this -

weekend. The first round game for

W&L will be against —guess who »

—Arkansas.

‘This game should be a little
different. We will be playing in a

longer pool which should be to our “

advantage. The pool will also be an all
deep pool which will change things
around as well. I am really looking
forward to some better officiating
which we will get up at Brown,”’ said
senior co-captain David Reavy.

4] The Washington and Lee
women’s volleyball team, which
finished its first season with the
+] best record ever of any first- year
women’s team at W&L, had its
season come to a close with a dis-
«| appointing outcome at the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference
Tournament.

‘| The Generals, 15-9 and 4-5 in
the ODAC during the regular
season, were hit with injuries very
early in the first match of the tour-
nament. Senior co-captain Melissa
Thrasher and freshman starter
Marcy Brown went down with in-
juries in the first game, and the
Generals had to struggle to stay on
‘| their feet the rest of the way.

‘| W&L dropped its first two mat-
ches of the tournament, losing to
Emory and Henry 15-2, 15-7 and
‘| top-seeded Bridgewater 15-9,
15-0. But the Generals rallied for a
'| win in their final game, beating
Mary Baldwin 15-9, 12-15, 15-9.

The W&L men’s soccer team

Nothing wrong with third-place finishes for x-country

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

Third place doesn’t sound like anything all that
great to achieve. But for the Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s cross country teams, a third-
place finish in Saturday’s Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championships would mean the Gen-
erals ran as well as could be expected.

Letting powerful Lynchburg and Eastern Men-
nonite battle it out for the conference champion-
ship, the men’s team put together a solid perfor-
mance and grabbed third place out of the seven-
team field. The Generals were led, as usual, by
senior Bill Clark, who finished fourth in a time of
28:45 over the 5-mile course. Freshmen Charles
Edwards (8th, 29:05) and Lee Parker (19th, 30:26),

junior Joe Geitner (24th, 31:12) and freshman Bill
Benson (30th, 32:23) were the other scorers for
W&L. Both Clark and Edwards were named to the
all-conference team on a day when heavy rains af-
fected everyone’s times.

‘*Both teams ran well,’’ said men’s head coach
Dick Miller. ‘‘We ran up to our capabilities. I think
everybody performed well despite adverse weather
conditions.

“It was a very nasty day. Thank goodness it was
primarily a pavement course — which I don’t like to
begin with — but it gave pretty reasonable footing
most of the time.”’

The women’s team would not be outdone by the
men. Led by sophomore Paige Cason, the defend-
ing ODAC champion, the women took third place
as well, with Eastern Mennonite and Lynchburg
finishing one-two respectively. Cason finished fifth
with a time of 21:27 for the 3.1-mile course and

was named to the all-ODAC team for the second
year in a row. She received support from sopho-
more Cecily Tynan (10th, 21:56), freshman Erika
Ingersoll (14th, 23:46), senior Stephanie Smith
(16th, 24:06) and sophomore Heather Jenkins
(18th, 24:19).

Both teams now will travel to the University of
the South (Sewanee, Tenn.) for the NCAA Division
III South/Southeast Regional Championships on
Saturday. The top men’s team plus the top three in-
dividual finishers (not from the top team) will qual-
ify for the national championships which will be
held at Washington University (Mo.) on Nov. 19.
The top women’s team plus the top four individuals
will qualify for the national championships. Last
year, Clark was named to the all- South/Southeast

” Regional team.

‘*Probably Emory [University] is the team to beat

again,’’said Miller of the men’s race.

had so much potential. It's really dis-
appointing that it didn’t deliver.’ A
perfect quote, for a very imperfect
film

Alien Nation stars James Caan
(Brian’s Song, The Godfather, Gar-
dens of Stone) as Matthew Sykes, a
cop whose partner gets literally blown
away by one of the ‘‘newcomers’’ and
Mandy Patinkin (Yentl, The Princess
Bride) as Sam Francisco (George) the
first newcomer promoted to the rank
of Detective on the L.A.P.D..
Together, Caan and Patinkin work to
find the ‘‘slag’’ who killed Caan’s
partner, but find themselves trapped
in the beginnings of a drug war in-
stead.

According to Francisco, his people
were genetically engineered to be
slaves on their home planet and to
keep them in control, the government
developed a super drug ten times more
potent than earth’s strongest drug.
The drug was used as a reward for
hard work so that the harder the
workers worked, the more drug they
got and the more drug they got, the
harder they worked. The drug seemed
simple, but there was some secret
about it that Francisco refused to tell
anyone.

No one on earth knew about the
drug so it wasn’t available until an en-
trepreneurial alien organized a group
to manufacture the drug. And now we
have a story line. Problem ? Yeah, be-
cause that’s where the quality part of
the film ends.

writer had ten months to write a
screenplay and spent nine and a half
weeks writing the first half of the film.
The beginning of the film is quite en
joyable and is full of witty, interesting
dialogue. There are twists and turns
and deadends where you thought you
had figured everything out, but hadn’t
and just when you are ready for the
climactic point in the film, it dies.

James Caan, Mandy Patinkin, and
Terence Stamp as the drug kingpin of
the newcomers are all quite good and
give more than adequate performan-
ces but the script and the speed of the
film really let them down. As I said,
the beginning of the film was very en-
joyable but the end races and leaves
more than a few questions unresolved.
The special effects are all right and the
storyline is intelligent. It’s too bad the
directors and writers couldn’t get the
speed right too.

If there was some saving grace for
this film it was that Caan’s partner at
the beginning was named Tuggle, but
lo, even that couldn’t save this dis-
appointment.
