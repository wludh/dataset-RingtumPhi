National Sororities will begin colon-
izing on the W&L campus in January
1989.

The Sorority Advisory Committee
voted on the decision on Tuesday,
Nov.1, after discussing the results of
the Sorority Interest Survey. There
are 116 women who responded they
would rush if the sororities came this
winter.

The survey was mailed to all under-
graduate women. Of the approximate
500 women contacted, 219 returned
the survey. The majority response

* (116 votes) was for the colonization of

:

sororities. There are 95 women who

ties.

¢ ities they would support. The alterna-

clubs (received 27 votes), Trident
(received 37 votes) and Co- ed Inde-
pendent Union (received 27 votes).
The option of no women’s organiza-
tion needed received 15 votes.

The Sorority Advisory Committee,
comprised of students, faculty and
administration, stressed many times
throughout the meeting that the colon-
ization of sororities will not eliminate
the existing organizations for women,
nor will it eliminate the possibility of
other organizations to come to the
campus.

‘‘We are simply responding posi-
tively to the need expressed by these
116 women,”’ said Dean of Greek Af-
fairs Leroy ‘‘Buddy’’ Atkins. The de-
cision to form sororities this winter
does not close the options for other
opportunities to be formed in the fu-
ture.

The advisory committee will con-
sider the three sororities women men-
tioned on their surveys and will con-
sider the research they have done on
sororities that have contacted W&L.

They will ask the National Director
for Extension of National Sororities,
Mrs. William Bradford, how many
should come to W&L.

Experience at other schools that
have recently colonized national sor-
orities, such as the University of
Richmond, indicates that more than
116 women will pre-register to rush.
At Richmond over twice as many
women rushed as the preliminary sur-
veys indicated.

The committee will invite twice as
many sororities to give presentations
than will actually come; from this
group they will decide which sorori-
ties will colonize at W&L. They will
take into consideration the funding the
sorority would provide, its policies for
extension, its dues, and the proximity
of chapters.

In late January the committee esti-
mates rush will begin for all classes of
women interested.

W&L expects 1700 at 34th
annual Parent’s Weekend

W&L’s campus is alive with acti-
wity as each fraternity house is being
cleaned, every dorm room straight-
éned, and all the laundry washed in
preparation for the 34th consecutive
Parents Weekend scheduled for this
Vriday, Saturday and Sunday.

. This year, as in the past, W&L’s
-Development Office is coordinating

Director of Development Carter
McNeese, W&L expects 1,500 to
{,700 curious parents, grandparents
and siblings for 1988’s Parents Week-

end.

« McNeese said this year’s schedule
is much the same as past years, but he
did point out several changes and addi-
tions to the calendar.

McNeese said, in the past, the
W&L Department of Music has given
only one concert. Generally it has
been some combination of choral and
woodwind groups. This year,
McNeese said there will be two separ-
ate concerts, The first, on Friday
eVening at 8 p.m. in Lee Chapel, will
headline W&L’s Choral ensembles.
The second, at 8 p.m. Saturday even-
itg in Doremus Gym, will feature the
W&L Wind Ensemble.

He also said the parents luncheon,
usually held indoors, would be held
outdoors this year if the weather per-
mits. The event, called ‘‘The Parents’
Weekend Harvest barbecue,’’ will be
held on the lawn in front of the Presi-
dént’s house from 12:15 to 1:15 p.m.

on Saturday afternoon. If the weather
does not allow the barbecue to be out-
side, it will be held in Evans Dining
Hall.

Professor Edward Hamer has been
involved with Parents’ Weekend since
1956, its second year. He says the
event, which used to be called Par-
ents’ Day, hasn’t changed much in
spirit since its early days.

He said Parents’ Day was a way for
“‘parents, who after all were paying
for their (children’s) education, to
have a chance to meet and get to know
the faculty.’

In keeping with the spirit of the
event, Hamer said, a large part of the
weekend has always been the parent-
faculty conferences. He said the Fri-
day evening concert in Lee Chapel
and the President's report to parents
on Saturday morning, are also hol-
dovers from the early days of Parents’
weekend.

Parents’ Weekend has
however, been without changes.

According to Hamer, in the past
there were lectures for the parents on
Friday evening. He said the dis-
cussions usually centered on some
academic topic such as foreign affairs
or literature.

The discussions, said Hamer, were
soon replaced with Parents’ Seminars.
Under the new system, he said, the
parents are split into about 10 groups
and then matched with a member of
the faculty, an administrator and a
student. The groups then discuss
whatever is of interest to the parents.
Hamer said he thinks parents have

Carriage Company

! Quits: unable to fund operations

 

By Gena Hauser

+The Lexington Carriage Company
had its last day of operation on Hal-
loween day.

‘Despite a request for $6,000 from
the Lexington City Council, the com-
pany will be unable to fund operations
far the coming year.

“I’ve already made my commit-
ients,”’ said Lexington City Manager
Joseph King.

The city does, however, hope the
bus shuttle will resume operations.
President Ben Nicely said, ‘* I have a
strong feeling the bus will be contin-
uéd, because the city wants more
bysiness for the Virginia Horse
Center.’’

‘The bus could make rounds, bring-
ing people from Lexington to the

horse center ind back

The Lexington Carriage Company
was sold to a group of investors two
years ago.

“It’s a very cut and dry business,”’
said Nicely, who used to drive one of
the carriages daily through the streets
of Lexington.

The tours normally are taken by five
to ten Lexington visitors daily. April,
May and June are dominated by senior
citizens, while June through Labor
Day normally brings families,

“It’s a very demanding job,’ said
Nicely.

Tours used to begin near the Visi-
tors’ Center, then drive on Washing-
ton Street, followed by Main Street.
and then into some residential areas.

The ‘‘clop, clop, clop’* of the hor-
ses will not be heard anymore in the
Streets of Lexington.

 

 

File Phote

found the new system much more in-
teresting and informative.

The switch from lectures to seminar
discussions has not been the only
change in Parents’ weekend over the
years.

‘It used to be,’’ said Hamer, ‘‘that
I and two or three other people would
handle everything.’ He said he and
his team used to arrange lodging and
schedule faculty meeting times for all
the parents.

He said, ‘‘Those were the early,
heroic days’’ of Parents’ Weekend.

Now, of course, planning for Par-
ents’ Weekend is far more decentra-
lized. Parents are responsible for their
own lodging, and students must ar-
range faculty meeting times for their
parents.

According to McNeese, the De-
velopment Office does not so much
plan Parents’ Weekend as coordinate
it.

He said, ‘‘We coordinate what the
various departments do, but the De-
velopment Office does not tell the in-
dividual department to arrange an
event for Parents’ Weekend. Most de-
partments,’” said McNeese. ‘* have
their own special event.’’ He added
that planning wasn’t really necessary
because ‘‘their is a highly cooperative
atmosphere at W&L anyway.”

Some of the most popular events at
past Parents’ weekends, said
McNeese, have been the parent-
faculty conferences, the concert in
Lee Chapel, the play presented by the

decides not to go through rush this
year, that would not mean she could

not mish in future years,”’ said Atkins.
In 1984-85, before women arrived

on the W&L campus, the Fraternity
Affairs Subcommittee studied the pos-
sible establishment of sororities. They
recommended to the university that if
interest was shown in sororities, the
University was obliged to show the
same support that it does for fraterni-
ties. They also suggested a committee
be formed when that interest was ex-
pressed to decide when and how the
sororities should be colonized.

In 1986-87 the Women’s Forum
Sorority Committee sponsored an in-
formational session and open forum
on sororities and the alternatives.
After that forum a survey was de-
livered to all undergraduate women;
the response to that survey indicated
sororities should not start until more
than 100 women wished to join.

The responses also indicated a need

Executive Committee:
Alternative proposals to CRC discussed

 

Stacy L Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee approved
three proposals Monday night for
alternative formations of the Confi-
dential Review Committee, and will
take these suggestions before the fa-
culty at its next meeting on Monday.

A subcommittee of the EC com-
posed of Dan DuPre, John Fialcowitz,
Alston Parker and John McDonough
wrote the proposals after reviewing
student and faculty opinion. There has
been serious debate concerning the
CRC, and the EC is attempting to find
a committee that the entire student
body can accept.

McDonough said in writing the
alternative proposals, the committee
was ‘“‘shooting more for what the stu-
dent body as a whole would prefer.”’

The primary proposal consists of a
committee composed of two voting
faculty members, two Student Con-
duct Committee members and three
students-at-large. The faculty mem-
bers are to be selected by Washington
and Lee University President John D.
Wilson. The SCC members are to be
nominated by the SCC and selected by
the EC and the students-at-large will
be selected by Wilson and approved
by the EC.

The second and third proposals will
act as options to consider at the faculty
meeting after the initial presentation
of the first proposal, the EC decided
Monday night.

The second alternative committee is
composed of one voting faculty mem-
ber, two non-voting faculty members,

one SCC member and three students-
at-large, while the third alternative
committee is composed of three voting
faculty members, one SCC member
and three students-at-large.

The members of the above commit-
tees will be selected in the same way
the members of the first proposed
committee would be selected.

The EC subcommittee said in their
proposal they would like to change the
ratio of the CRC because of ‘‘the phi-
losophy of the student-run govern-
ment, the need for student input
through elected class officers, the
composition of the student body and
the negative perception by the white
male majority due to the racial/gender
ratio in the current CRC.”’

The CRC is currently composed of
four faculty members and three stu-
dents-at-large. The breakdown of the
committee is four women and two
blacks. Some students have come
forward and said that is a misrepresen-
tation of the white male majority at
this school.

The EC subcommittee also said in
the proposal that their suggestions
‘‘still preserve a maximum level of
confidentiality, the rights of the victim
and perceptions of fairness necessary
for cases to be heard.”’

The EC subcommittee wrote these
alternate proposals with the rights of
the victim and of the accused in the
mind.

In other business, the new policy
that bans posters and flyers from be-
ing hung on the colonnade was ap-
proved, reported Mark Cobb. Build-
ings and Grounds will remove any
flyers that are hung on the colonnade

from now on.

Any posters should be hung on the
bulletin boards on campus, which are
behind Payne Hall, by the Co-Op and
in front of DuPont Hall.

Senior Chuck Shissias made a bud-
get request for the Journal of Science
for $1,000. The EC approved the
budget allocation. The budgets for the
Ski Club and Liberty Hall Volunteers
were frozen at the meeting because the
two groups failed to post announce-
ments about their meetings at the law
school.

month were announced at the meeting
and are as follows:

University adoptsAIDS policy

by Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Health Committee in

’ the spring of 1988 proposed and adop-

ted a University policy for handling
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syn-
drome (AIDS) cases and education.
This policy is based on the American
College Health Association’s General
Statement on Institutional Response to
AIDS.

Students or employees who test po-
sitive for the antibody to HIV or who
have AIDS ‘‘will not be excluded
from enrollment or employment or re-
stricted in their access to university
facilities or services, unless a medi-
cally based judgment... establishes
that exclusion or restriction is neces-

sary to the welfare of the infected in-
dividual or the welfare of other mem-
bers of the university community’’ as
stated in the draft for the policy pro-
posal.

A person who suspects he might
have AIDS is ‘‘expected’’ to seek
knowledge regarding his possible in-
fection. If he is infected, he should not
behave in a manner that would threa-
ten the health of other university
members. Furthermore, he should no-
tify ‘‘one of the university physicians,
a member of the psychological coun-
seling staff, or a member of the Dean
of Students office, so that the univer-
sity can respond appropriately to their
health and educational needs.’’ This
notification would be ‘‘on a confiden-
tial basis’? according to the policy

proposal.

The university will conduct an ong-
oing educational program to keep uni-
versity members informed of basic
AIDS information and safety guide-
lines.

The director of the Student Health
Committee is to serve as case manager
for individual cases and will help
determine whether a need exists to re-
strict that individual from enrollment
or employment. The policy requires
that ‘‘confidentiality of medical in-
formation will be respected, and dis-
closed to Public Health officials as re-
quired by law.”’

““Testing’’ according to the Health
Committee’s proposal ‘‘is available

OPINION

Check the
Speed Limit

By Michael Tuggle

 

In the September 15 edition of the Ring-tum Phi,
Police Chief Bruce Beard was quoted as saying ‘*...this town was
out of control.‘‘ Well, call it missing the forest for the trees but
Chief Beard needs to check the ‘‘control‘* and professionalism of
his officers.

Lexington

About a month ago on the Friday night that the freshman pledged
at their various houses, I was in the front yard of my fraternity
house on Washington Street roasting a pig for a Saturday lunch and
noticed a great number of police cars driving up and down Wash-
ington Street. At first, I thought little of all the activity since the
Police Station is on Washington Street, but as the night wore on the
police activity increased and the cars started driving by faster and
faster.

Around 11:30 p.m. a police car turned off of Washington on to
Varner Lane (the road that passes in front of the old Visitor’s
Center) and accelerated down Varner into the first gravel parking
lot on the right.

The car sat in the parking lot for three or four minutes with the
lights on and then suddenly accelerated again, spun around nearly
360 degrees in the gravel and accelerated out of the lot and down
Varner toward Washington Street. The car slowed down at the stop

sign, did a ‘‘rolling stop** and proceeded up Washington toward the
police station.

In a similar instance last spring, there was a domestic disturbance
at the end of Varner Lane and at least three or four police cars came
flying down Varner screeching to a stop at the end of the street.
Once stopped, officers got out of there cars with their pistols
drawn.

About thirty minutes after the cars first answered the call, a
police car sitting in the first parking lot previously mentioned, again
floored the accelerator and spun around, finally exiting the lot. This
time though, the police car came straight across the street and up the
driveway leading to the Pi Kappa Phi and Kappa Sigma parking
lots. The car accelerated quickly up the hill and then back down.

Then this past weekend I was walking on Washington St. toward
home and a police car came flying over the hill by the Centel office
with his blue light on driving well, well over the speed limit and
flew past me near Tucker St.. Once past Kappa Sig the car slowed
down, turned off the blue light and then proceeded up Washington
where the car turned into the residential neighborhood at the end of
the street.

What is going on? Are police officers above the speed limits
whenever they feel like driving a little faster than normal? On the
whole, the police do an adequate job, but the driving is out of hand.
Tear night was a rainy night and there were lots of people walking
up and down Washington Street going to and from various parties.
All it takes is hitting a slick place in the road and someone gets hit.

I realize that in the case of an emergency a policeman is required
to act as quickly as possible, but I have a sneaky suspicion that the
guidelines say something about safety as well. The police zip up and
down Washington Street daily traveling well above the 25-mile-an-
hour posted limit. Something needs to be done before someone gets
hurt. Policeman are employed to enforce the law; not bend it until it
breaks.

The Ring-tum Phi Staff
would like to wish
everyone a

safe
and
enjoyable
Parents’ Weekend

A Survival Guide to Parent’s Weekend ~_

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

Once again it is time for students to
test their psychological, intellectual
and physical skills in the most rig-
orous ordeal of the year —Parents’
Weekend. In comparison, final exams
are easy and an honor violation is re-
laxing. In order to continue this ritual
without the students rioting, admin-
istrators make Parents’ Weekend out
to be a fun-fill weekend of family ac-
tivities. Don’t believe this lie for a
second. To put it bluntly, parents’
Weekend is 48 hours of living hell.
The thing that makes the weekend so
tough is that powerful political faction
known as ‘‘mothers.”’

During Parent’s Weekend, mothers
are relentless. Once they discover a
weakness, they will prey upon it until
you break down and admit defeat. The
best thing about the week-end is fath-
ers who are just happy to see you alive
because they know just how incompe-
tent you really are. In order to help
students get through this tough week-
end, I have compiled a list of helpful
hints.

First of all, remember who you are
dealing with. Don’t think of your
mother as the bread-baking, gift giv-
ing person you loved as a child. As
soon as she hits the Lexington border,
your mother becomes a_ trained
professional on a mission to find your
faults and capable of detecting mil-
dewed laundry at a distance of over
1,000 feet.

If it’s possible, keep your mother

out of your room. The best way to do
this is by padlocking the door and
swearing that your room is under
quarantine for a rare case of the bu-
bonic plague. Convince your mother
that the fate of the nation depends on
keeping your door locked. During last
year’s Parents’ Weekend, my mother
spent 27 laborious hours bringing my
room to a near sanitary level. As you
might imagine, she was very unhappy
to discover a group of illegal aliens
living in my closet. If you cannot keep
your mother out of your room, con-
vince her that it was clean until for-
eign agents, searching for classified
documents, ransacked it.

Try to make a good first impres-
sion. The first time you see your par-
ents, it is a good idea to be holding a
book, like the Scholar’s Edition of
Alighieri Dante’s 12-volume poem A

Fly Dies Slowly.”’ Also, maintain ’

good personal hygiene so you can }*

avoid being ridiculed as I was last
year. I was waiting at the airport
when I spotted my parents. They
looked at me and had this conversa-
tion:

Mom: I wonder why that filthy hip-
pie over there is waving at us.

Dad: I think that’s our son. !

Under no circumstances whatsoever
should you let your mother see your
checkbook. Within a matter of seconds
she will spot checks you wrote to
places like The Playboy Video Club.

Check your refrigerator for dead in-

sects and milk with an expiration date _

prior to Sept. 1.
Last of all, don’t lose hope; if Par- .
ents’ Weekend is any later next year it

will be over Thanksgiving Break and ’

you can go home.

Is it political coverage or a biography?

 

MY VIEW
By Courtney Payne

 

Let’s face it... the most exciting
issues arising in the American politi-
cal arena are purely personal. Gary
Hart had his Donna Rice, Teddy Ken-
nedy has his Chappaquidick, and Dan
Quayle had his... where should I
start?

Long after Americans forget Bush’s
slogan, they'll remember that Dan
Quayle’s family (supposedly) maneu-
vered him out of Vietnam. More peo-
ple remember the name ‘Donna

Rice’ than recall Gary Hart’s political
affiliation (Democrat). Is nothing
sacred? Should it be?

Admittedly, most public figures

realize that their personal lives attract
a certain amount of attention. Dan
Quayle should have guessed from the
start that any suspicious ‘‘encounters”’
with females other than his wife are
fair game for the media. Quayle, of
course, is not the only recipient of
close public scrutiny. Just recently,
(false) rumors flew that George Bush
was running around on Barbara. Not
too much before that, we discovered
that Kitty Dukakis had been addicted
to diet pills. We’ve been subjected to
reports on Ronnie’s cancer, Nancy’s
cancer, and even Sandra Day O’Con-
nor’s-cancer. We even know that
Nancy consults an astrologist. Yet,
Jack Kennedy’s ‘‘goings on’’ in the
White House were not common topics
of conversation. It makes you wonder
why the media is so frightfully
thorough in ‘‘covering’’ the private

lives of public figures these days.
Have we decided that they should be
excruciatingly vulnerable to examina-
tion by press and public?

Dan Quayle is a case in point. He
MIGHT be qualified to be an emer-
gency president, but no one really
knows because we’ve all been too
busy looking for other ‘‘wrongdo-
ings’’ to pin on him. Strikes against
his personal life will follow him for-
ever, influencing the rest of his politi-
cal career. It seems that there is a fine
line between what should be known
and what should not. Gary Hart’s dis-
astrous “‘fling’’; with Donna Rice
ruined his career, although that aspect
of his life should not theoretically af-
fect his political performance. The
real issue is whether or not a poli-
tician’s personal morals affect his
leadership abilities. Jack Kennedy is

LETTER

Sigma Society- a burning issue

suspected of having had Mafia ties and

being involved with Marilyn Monroe. °
However, National Inquirer-type stor- ‘

ies were not splashed cross the front
pages for eager readers to snatch up.

No one questioned his credentials be- ,

cause he MIGHT have been cheating
on his wife.

The press cannot take full responsi-
bility for a national preoccupation
with our leaders’ personal lives. Gran-
ted, the issues of Jack Kennedy’s era
were more pressing than the color of
his socks. But we face problems today
that threaten to destroy our society as
we know it. It is time to push oursel-
ves away from reports of Ronnie’s jel-
lybean habit, vote and get to the real
issues at hand. But the way, how

much money did Geraldine Ferraro’s |

husband embezzle?

To the Washington and Lee community:

I would like to bring to your attention that the
Sigma society is again branding students as a part
of their initiation process. I saw two students last
year with significant infections to the brand burns,
and so far have seen one student this year who re-
quired antibiotic therapy. The Sigma society ap-
parently has a longstanding tradition of branding
their initiates with the Greek letter Sigma in the
right groin area, a practice that I find both medi-
cally and morally abhorrent.

While I feel my first responsibility is to treat the
consequences of this practice when students pre-
sent themselves for care in the Student Health
Center, I also feel it is my responsibility to bring
this practice to the attention of the Washington

and Lee community in the hopes that something
can be done to stop it. Branding is a dangerous
hazing practice, no different from those which
have received national attention when students fi-
nally were seriously injured. I feel that the poten-
tial for serious illness or injury is present in this si-
tuation, and that it would not reflect well on
Washington and Lee University if such an inci-
dent did occur.

I feel that peer pressure is what keeps so-called
‘‘traditions*‘ alive at Washington and Lee, and I
hope that increased awareness and open dis-
cussion of dangerous hazing initiation practices
will result in peer pressure that may help end
them. I hope this can happen before ap individual
student is severely injured.

Thank you tor your consideration of this prob-
lem.

To the Editors:

W&L is a dog-infested campus. Personally, I
love to see puppies and dogs romping through the
quads, playing outside the Co-op and even wan-
dering through Tucker Hall. But recently, my
roommates and I experienced extreme difficulty
trying to leave our apartment to go to dinner. We
were stopped on the second-floor landing by the
sight of two dogs (half wolf, half something else)
gnawing on a live cat.

Needless to say, the sight was not a pretty one.
And dinner certainly could have been more fun.
What made the instance even worse than the sheer

horror of the scene is the fact that the cat probably
was someone’s pet. Since then, I have seen those
dogs attacking puppies and overheard numerous
complaints from other students describing scenes
of a puppy howling from fear as it hides under a
bench trying to escape the dogs, of owners being
nipped at while trying to rescue their puppies from
the dogs, and even of small children being fright-
ened by the dogs chasing them and nipping at
them.

Monday morning, the entire Co-op was disrup-
ted as those two dogs chased another dog into the
building. People parted right and left as the snarl-

 

ing mass ran through the building. About two
hours after this incident, I again saw the dogs
jumping on another dog. One was biting the dog
around the neck.

As I stated before, I like dogs and pets roaming
around campus. It creates a homey, playful at-
mosphere. What I do not like is the possibility that
someone else’s pet could possibly harm or even
kill another's pet or even someone’s child. If you

cannot trust your pet, do not unleash it on
someone else's.

Low Blows on the
Campaign Trail

 

MY VIEW

‘By Ed Gallagher

As far back as spring 1987, ‘an
onymous tipsters’? contacted journa-

_ lists across the national suggesting that

Gary Hart was not the only presi-
‘ential candidate involved in extra-
marital activities. When George Bu-
sha and Michael Dukakis were in Los

; Angeles recently for the second presi-

dential debate, an entire issue of the
‘LA Weekly was devoted to ‘‘the dark
#ide of George Bush.”’

On Wednesday, Oct. 19, the Dow
Jones dropped 43 points in response to
@ rumor that the Washington Post
planned to publish an article linking
the vice president with adulterous ac-
fivities.

Eleanor Randolph points out in her
urticle on Friday, Oct. 21, in the Post
that the market drop created a dilem-
ma in the media because editors ‘‘had
to explain to their readers or viewers
jvhat happened to the market without
spreading unsubstantiated _ political
tumor.’’ The steadfast denials by the
Post and the accurate detailed stories
hbout the rumor appearing in USA To-
day and the Wall Street Journal
suggest the dilemma was handled
properly by the media. However,
Donna Brazile, the Dukakis cam-
paign’s deputy national field director,
bn Thursday. Oct. 20, referred to the
rumor in a way that typifies the 1988
presidential campaign’s negative tone.
, ‘‘I wasn’t on the stock market yes-
terday, but I understood they got a

*uittle concerned that George was going

to the White House with somebody
other than Barbara.’’ Although Bra-

 

zile resigned shortly after this state-
ment was made and Dukakis apolo-
gized and distanced himself from her
remarks, the fact remains that these
totally unwarranted negative words
were spoken. By no means, however,
does the blame for the pessimistic atti-
tude of the campaign rest solely with
the Democrats.

Six weeks ago, the Maryland GOP,
headed by chairman Daniel E. Flem-
ing, sent a letter to its contributors,
which included a picture of Michael
Dukakis alongside convicted mur-
derer and rapist William Horton. Hor-
ton was serving a life sentence for
murder when he raped a Maryland
woman after escaping from a Massa-
chusetts prison furlough program.
The Maryland Republican Commit-
tee’s letter asks, ‘‘Is this your pro-
family team for 1988?’’ Last Sunday,
Republican presidential campaign
chairman James Baker denounced the
Maryland GOP letter much as Duka-
kis denied accountability for Brazile’s
remarks. The condemnations for ac-
tions occurring within the respective
campaigns by their leadership does
not change the overall negative tone of
the presidential race.

The widespread pessimism in the
campaign can only have a negative
effect on the general election. Ameri-
cans are fed up with the low blows
each party has thrown at one another.
The average American voter wanted
substance in the campaign, but
received superficial bickering be-
tween the Republicans and the Demo-
crats. Hence, the public lost interest in
the 1988 presidential campaign. This
will lead to a low voter turnout on
Nov. 8, and a relatively inaccurate re-
flection of who should be the next
President of the United States.

In late July of 1986, Nicaragua
filed suit with the ICJ against Hon-
‘duras and Costa Rica. The Nicaraguan
government asked that the use of it’s
neighbors territories as Contra bases
be prohibited. A little over a year
later, these three nations, plus Guate-
mala and El Salvador, signed a history
¢naking peace plan. Still a year later,
hopes for the success of the plan, Es-
‘quipulas II, are nil, and it’s author,
Oscar Arias Sanchez, the president of
Costa Rica, is described as feeling
“‘alternately discouraged, angry and
powerless.”

Arias’ plan has 10 tenets, all of
‘hich apply equally to each nation.
they are:

1) National Reconciliation: the ini-
tiation of a dialogue between unarmed
opposition forces and their govern-
ments and the release of all political
prisoners.

2) Ceasefire: an undertaking by
tach government to end_ hostilities
within its borders.

‘ 3) Democratization: each govern-

ment was charged to promote, ‘‘an
authentic, democratic, pluralist and
participatory process;’’ including
freedom of the press and the lawful
organization of opposition political
parties.

4) Free Elections: ‘‘free, pluralist
and honest’’ elections were to be held
on all levels and to be monitored by
international observers.

5) Suspension of Military Aid: a
request by each country for aid to in-
surgents to be discontinued.

6) Non-use of Territory to Attack
Other States: all five nations promised
to prevent the use of their territories to
destabilize the region.

7) Negotiations Relating to Secur-
ity, Verification, Control and Arms
Litigation: continued negotiations
monitored by the Contadora Group.

8) Attention to Refugees and the
Displaced: a commitment to give
protection and aid to refugees and to
facilitate their ‘‘repatriation, resettle-
ment and relocation.”’

9) Co-operation, Democracy, and
Freedom for Peace and Development:

was that all its initiatives were vol-

when it was convenient to do so.

The plan cannot, however, be writ-
ten off as a total failure. It did begin a

General Volunteers help
the Lexington community

 

By Keri Wessel
Staff Reporter

 

Kline,
phia, PA- **

The General Volunteers is a ser-
vice organization that began last year
under the direction of Mory Watkins
°88. Watkins sought to bridge the gap
between W&L students and the Lex-
ington community by providing vol-
unteers for various social service
groups within Rockbridge County.

Students participating are asked to
commit a minimum of one hour per
week to the program of their choice.
The General Volunteers coordinates
the students and the program. Options
for the students range from tutoring to
physical therapy.

A tutoring program has been started
at Lexington High School and will
eventually include Lylburn Downing
Middle School. Volunteers, including
some pre-med students, currently are
woiking at the Stonewall Jackson

Hospital in a variety of situations.
These include the medical/surgical
ward, obstetrics and physical therapy.
There also are volunteers at both the
Eagles Nest Clubhouse and the Lin-
coln House.

The Eagle’s Nest Clubhouse, lo-
cated in Buena Vista, is a support
system providing daily counseling for
the mentally ill.

The Lincoln House provides a set- :
ting in which mentally retarded adults
learn everyday skills and preliminary
job training. Both facilities help quali-
fied clients find jobs in the commun-
ity.

Students wishing to participate in
any of these programs are required to
sign a contract stating their area of in-
terest and the amount of time they are
willing to commit per week.

Those interested in joining the Gen-
eral Volunteers or getting more in-
formation about a particular program
should contact either Benny Savage or
Keri Wessel.

Three trustees end terms of service

Athletes question drug testing policy

rights regarding due process of law

by Chris Baradel
Staff Reporter

 

If you were going to write a head-
line for the year in college sports, one
that would have to be considered is
The Year of the Substance Abuser.

The year began with the University
of Miami losing their middle line-
backer for the national championship
game against Oklahoma because of a
failed drug test.

Sports Illustrated recently broke a
story by a former University of South
Carolina football player detailing
steroid use in his life and by his team-
mates. Brian Bosworth’s autobiogra-
phy tells of similar problems at the
University of Oklahoma. Locally,
Virginia Tech wrestler Steele
McGonegal refused, with great pub-
licity, to take the university drug tests.
(He has since agreed to sign a waiver
form.)

Naturally, with drugs affecting so
many athletes in so many sports, the
issue of drug testing has been closely
scrutinized.

Here at W&L, there is no drug test-
ing policy. Athletes must sign a form
at the beginning of each athletic

season stating that they will submit to
testing should they reach an NCAA
championship event. Anyone who re-
fuses to sign is ineligible to practice or
compete. Associate Athletic Director
Dick Miller meets with the athletes
and explains the rules and lists the
groups of banned substances to them
before they sign the form. Miller says,
‘The only place we would be tested is
at an NCAA championship event. It
would be random testing, only known
by the NCAA testing group. For ex-
ample, in tennis last year they tested
the semi-finalists. ’’

According to athletic department
officials, there are three reasons why
athletes aren’t tested by the school.
Miller explained, ‘‘It’s very expen-
sive. We couldn’t afford to test all our
athletes. Secondly, its not the answer.
Education is the only answer.”’

Athletic Director William McHenry
added, ‘‘President Wilson does not
feel that it is appropriate to test all ath-
letes at the Division III level.”’

A fourth reason concerns questions
about the constitutionality of drug test-
ing. McGonegal based his refusal to
take the Virginia Tech test on the fact
that it violated his Fourth Amendment

and probable cause.

Randall P. Bezanson, W&L dean of

law, said a number of court cases in-
volving drug testing are still pending,
so the legality of testing has not been
resolved. He said, **’
testing depends on how reasonable the
form of testing used is in achieving its
purpose.’’ However, he added,
‘Drug testing, if invasive, is a search
and seizure.”

There are between 3,500 and 4,000
banned substances, ranging from
chemicals as well-known as caffeine
and as mysterious as _benzthide.
However, a real problem for athletes
is that many over-the-counter drugs
contain banned substances. For exam-
ple, taking Sudafed could be enough
to be disqualified.

The testing process itself is a com-
plicated one, but basically the ath-
lete’s urine is collected (under superv-
ision) and two vials are filled from the
sample. The vials are labeled, sealed
and secured. The secured container is
shipped to an independent lab, where
one vial is tested. If the first test is po-
sitive, the second vial is also tested,
with the results being final.

can be easily circumvented, McHenry

Three Washington and Lee Univer-
sity trustees ended their terms of ser-
vice during the recent board of
trustees meeting in Lexington.

The trustees who retired are Joseph
S. Keelty of Baltimore, Md., SL Ko-

pald Jr. of Memphis, Tenn., and
Frank G. Young of Fort Worth,
Texas.

A native of Baltimore, Keelty atten-
ded W&L from 1940 to 1942 and
received a bachelor’s degree in 1943
from Loyola College. After serving
three years as an officer in the U.S.
Navy, he joined the family-owned
business James Keelty & Co. in 1946.

He is currently president of the re-
sidential building and land de-
velopment firm which operates in the
Baltimore metropolitan area. Keelty is
a member of the board of trustees of
Loyola College and the board of direc-
tors of Equitable Bancorporation. He
previously served as trustee of Mary-

said, *‘There is no way in the world
that an NCAA sample can be swit-
ched.”’

There has never been an athlete dis-
qualified at W&L, thanks in large part
to the strict adherence and complete
understanding of the rules. McHenry
recalled, ‘‘We told them (student ath-
letes) to report if (they) are taking any-
thing at the time of testing. We had an
individual who informed the doctor at
the time of testing that he was taking
one of the banned substances by doc-
tor’s prescription.”’ Since the doctor
was notified before the test, the athlete
was not declared ineligible when the
sample showed traces of the sub-
stance. According to McHenry, ‘“‘It’s
the athlete’s responsibility to inform
the team trainer.”’

Robert Haley, who was tested dur-
ing last year’s NCAA Division III
tennis tournament, described the ac-
tual testing as ‘‘a tedious process’’ and
‘*kind of a pain.’’ However, he said,
“I really think it’s a pretty good
thing.’’ Haley does have a complaint
against one part of the testing. He
said, ‘‘I know it’s expensive, but I
think (testing) should be done on a
team basis, not an individual basis. I
think that if you test one person, you
should test everyone.”’

Party debate held in chapel

‘By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

}. The chairmen of Virginia’s two
major political parties returned to
‘their alma mater last night to discuss
jwhat is at stake in next week’s state
and national elections.
’ Donald W. Huffman, the chairman
of the Virginia Republican Party, and
Lawrence H. Framme III, the com-
qmonwealth’s top Democrat, traded
criticism and commentary in a some-
‘times heated exchange in Lee Chapel
at Washington and Lee University, the
school from which both men received
iaw degrees.
, In discussing the race for the U.S.
Senate in Virginia between Republi-
¢an Maurice Dawkins and Democrat
Charles S$. Robb, Huffman said, ‘‘The
Republican candidate is way down’’
and a victory by Dawkins over Robb
would be ‘‘a monumental upset.”’
set.”
; Framme called Robb ‘‘a man of
national acclaim and national stature’’
and said those qualities would be ‘‘a
change for the Senate seat he will oc-
cupy.’’ That seat is now held by Re-
publican Paul S, Trible, Jr.
, Although he predicted defeat for the
GOP in the Virginia Senate race,
Huffman said the commonwealth will
yote Republican in the presidential
election. When Framme discussed
what he thought an administration led
by Democratic nominee Michael S.
_ Dukakis could achieve, Huffman shot

back, ‘‘There won’t be a Dukakis ad-
ministration.’

Huffman said Republican nominee
George Bush ‘‘is as well-qualified
through his experience to be president
of the U.S. as any man in my life-
time,’’ and predicted that Bush ‘‘will
be a good, caring, compassionate
president.”

Framme tried to associate Robb and
Dukakis with the integrity and honor
that he said were guiding principles in
the life of Gen. Robert E. Lee, princi-
ples that he said have been missing
under President Reagan.

“T believe in the bottom of my heart
that the principles of Michael Dukakis
and the principles of Robert E. Lee go
hand-in-hand,” said Framme, and he
said that people who are not dedicated
to those principles ‘‘have no business
being in public life.”’

Huffman admitted that some corrup-
tion has existed in the Reagan admin-
istration, but he said ‘‘There isn’t go-
ing to be an administration that
doesn’t have problénis’’ because
“there are too many temptations’ fac-
ing thousands of federal employees.

The Republican party chief said
Gov. Dukakis’ government in Massa-
chusetts has had to deal with corrup-
tion of its own, but Huffman said he
was sure any Massachusetts em-
ployees who were convicted of crimes
“thave had their sentences commuted

or been paroled,’’ a reference to the

Republican claim that Dukakis has
been soft on criminals.

Framme criticized Bush for what he
called campaigning ‘‘on a negative
basis’’ and said charges that Dukakis
would advocate a weak national de-
fense or foreign policy are not true.

He said polls that give Bush a lead
over Dukakis nationwide show that
“the paid political gurus in their back
room might be more effective than the
paid political gurus in our back
room.””

But Framme didn’t let those polls
keep him from hammering away at the
Reagan adminstration, claiming it
never submitted a balanced budget to
Congress and attempted: to trade arms
for hostages in Iran.

Huffman countered with charges
that a Democratic administration
would be soft on communism.

‘*The Democratic Party has never
seen the threat that has come from the
left,’ he said.

The presentation. was part of
W&L’s Contact lecture series, which
is a joint project of the school’s Inter-
Fraternity Council and the Executive
Committee of the W&L student body.

At age 3, Robert A. Vienneau, a
second-year W&L law student, began
private lessons in Montreal, Canada.

 

 

M. Theodore Van Leer

New Trustees join Board

 

Staff Report

 

Three new members of the Wash-
ington and Lee University board of
trustees were elected at the board’s re-
cent fall meeting in Lexington.

The new members are Gray C.
Castle of New Canaan, Conn., H.F.
“*Gerry’’ Lenfest of Huntingdon Val-
ley, Pa., and M. Theodore Van Leer
of Glen Ridge, N.J. The election of
the three trustees brings the number of
WA&L trustees to 30.

A native of Salem, Mass., Castle
received his bachelor’s degree from
W&L in 1953 and his law degree from
W&L in 1955. While a student, Castle
served as secretary to Omicron Delta
Kappa the national leadership
fraternity. He also served as freshman
dormitory counselor and assistant
head dorm counselor. He was a mem-
ber of the President's Advisory
Committee and vice president of the
Spring Dances Committee. He served
as head cheerleader and chairman of
the Assimilation Committee. Castle
also was a member of the Phi Gamma
Delta social fraternity.

Currently vice president for di-
versified operations and corporate af-
fairs for MONY Financial Services,
Castle has worked as counsel for a
number of corporations, including
Union Carbide, Pyrofax Gas, Mobile

‘**The Americans are coming; the
Americans are coming!”’

That will be the cry of citizens in
four Soviet cities next spring when
W&L sends its first group of students
ever to visit the Soviet Union.

The trip, which is being offered
through the history department and
lead by Assistant History Professor
Richard Bidlack, will include 28 days
in the Soviet Union and four days in
Warsaw, Poland.

Bidlack said the trip is intended to
provide a ‘‘look into contemporary
Soviet society in the context of Soviet
history.’’ Specifically, he said some
of the areas the students will look into
involve Gorbachev’s perestroika revo-
lution in terms of liberalization of the
press, public opinion, contact with
foreigners, and restructuring of the
government.

The proposed cost of the trip is
$2,600, which is dependent on the
number of students who go on the trip
and the strength of the dollar. Bidlack
said 25 students have already expres-

Oil, Xerox and INA. He joined
MONY in 1985 as chief legal counsel
and attained his current position in
1986.

Castle also is a member of the bars
of New York, Virginia, Washington,
D.C., and the U.S. Supreme Court.
He is the founder and first president of
the Westchester-Fairfield Corporate
Counsel Association, and is a member
of the American Corporate Counsel
Association, the Association of Life
Insurance Counsel, and the Interna-
tional Advisory Board of the South-
western Legal Foundation. He is
president of the Rescon Companies —
a real estate partnership firm — and is
director of the Oenoke Condominium
Association.

Lenfest is a native of Jacksonville,
Fla., and received his bachelor’s de-
gree from W&L in 1953 and law de-
gree from Columbia University in
1958. While a student at W&L,
Lenfest was a four-year member of
the soccer team, and was a member of
the Forensic Union and the Sigma Chi
social fraternity.

He served seven years as a lawyer
with Davis Polk & Wardwell in New
York. In 1965, he became associate
counsel for Triangle Publications and
later became editorial director and pu-
blisher of Seventeen magazine.
Lenfest is president of the Lenfest
Group, the nation’s 35th largest cable

sed an interest in going, including stu-
dents who are studying under Visiting
Associate Sociology Professor
Krzysztof Jasiewicz, who is here from
Warsaw.

Bidlack said he would like to have a
final count of students who plan to go
by next week.

Students will receive six credits for
the term. These credits may be taken
all within the history department or
split between history and any other
department with approval from that
department. Bidlack said that he
didn’t think there would be any prere-
quisites, but he strongly recom-
mended that the students have some
knowledge of the Soviet Union, either
through the history, politics or econ-
omics departments, or through a
background in Russian language.

The first two weeks of the term will
be spent doing background reading on
the Soviet Union and practical aspects
of living there, Bidlack said. The stu-
dents will then fly to the Soviet Union
where they will visit Moscow, Leni-
ngrad, Tbilisi and Vilnius.

Bidlack said he chose Moscow since
it’s the capital, Leningrad because he
lived there for almost a year, Tbilisi

kets, and in King of Prussia, Lebanon,

Earlier this year, Lenfest and his
wife, Marguerite Lenfest, donated $3

named the Lenfest Center for the Per-
forming Arts.

A native of Mobile, Ala., Van Leer
received his bachelor’s degree from
W&L in 1951. While a student at
W&L, Van Leer was a four-year
member of the cross country team and
was a member of the track team. He
was elected to the Monogram Club in
both his junior and senior years and
was a member of the Spiked Shoe So-
ciety. He was a member of the Phi
Kappa Sigma social fraternity.

Van Leer is president of the Van
Leer Chocolate Corp. He is a member
and former president and secretary of
the Chocolate Manufacturers of the
United States and is a member of the
National Confectioners Association
and the Associated Retail Confec-
tioners of the United States. He is a di-
rector of the Dairy Supply Industry.

Van Leer is chairman of the Glen
Ridge Community Services Commit-
tee and serves as a trustee of the Glen
Ridge Community Fund.

Bidlack leads trip behind Curtain

because it is in non-European Russia
and Vilnius because it is in the Baltic
states.

‘*The Baltic states are probably the
most interesting area in the Soviet
Union right now because they are try-
ing to exercise a bit more autonomy,”’
Bidlack said. Vilnius, the capital of
Lithuania, has been a kind of testing
ground for the perestroika reforms.
Recently, 300,000 citizens signed a
petition demanding international in-
spection of their nuclear power plants.
Thus, Lithuania and the other Baltic
states may prove to be successes of the
reforms, or they may take their recent
nationalism and try to break from the
Soviet Union, an attempt the Soviet
government would surely try to crush.

The students will then move on to
Warsaw, where Bidlack said they will
have a chance to compare East block
countries. They will spend four days
there before returning to W&L.

These lessons were only the beginning
of a musical career that recently cul-
minated in a concert performance at
America’s Society in New York on
Oct. 24.

‘**New York was the brainstorm of
alumnus Robert Mottley,’’ explained
Vienneau. After reading an article
about Vienneau, Mottley was intri-
gued by Vienneau’s statement that he
liked Lexington audiences better than
New York audiences.

Mottley requested a tape from
Vienneau and decided to test Vien-
neau’s preference. He sent the tape
and letters to various people and or-
ganizations in New York. Vienneau
even has a letter from Jacqueline

B&Bs discussed tonight

by Betsy Griffin
Staff Reporter

 

Tonight there will be a public
hearing concerning a new ordinance
on bed and breakfast establishments.

According to Lexington Building
and Zoning Administrator Don Mette,
the ordinance would allow the City
Council to control the presence of bed
and breakfast inns in the city of Lex-
ington. Currently, there is no ordin-
ance which states the Council’s pol-
icy.

The new ordinance would, accord-
ing to Mette, ‘‘state what the Council
has been doing for years.’’ It would
permit a two-guest bed and breakfast
establishment anywhere in town.
Under the proposed law, if someone
established an inn that accommodated
more than two guests, a hearing be-
fore Council must be held. This way,
Council could impose restrictions
concerning parking and noise control.

Many establishments in Lexington
now offer a room and breakfast, but
are considered tourist homes or down-
town businesses.

One such inn is the Llewellyn

Onassis.

When Lucille Duncan listened to the
tape, she arranged the concert for
Vienneau with the help and sponsor-
ship of the America’s Society, a non-
profit organization that promotes La-
tin American and Canadian art and
also the Canadian Consulate, the New
York Chapter of W&L alumni and the
Quebec Mission.

“It was my first big concert by my-
self in a major city, but,”’ said Vien-
neau, “‘you can’t do it without the
help of a lot of people. Just renting out
a concert hall costs a tremendous
amount of money.”’

The hall was small but filled to
standing room only with approxi-
mately 130 attendees, according to
Vienneau. The concert was given for
the W&L alumni, but was open to the
public. He said, ‘‘The Fiji (his frater-
nity during his undergraduate years at
W&L) representatives from New
York attended the concert and suppor-

Lodge on South Main Street. It offers
a room and breakfast, but was con-
sidered by Council to be a tourist
home. It would not be affected by the
proposed ordinance.

Fassifern Bed and Breakfast is lo-
cated outside of Lexington on Va. 39
near the horse center and would not be
under the proposed ordinance. It con-
tains four rooms in the main house and
two rooms in outbuildings.

There are some establishments in
downtown Lexington which offer both
a room and breakfast, but are re-
gistered as a corporation. These also
would not be directly affected by the
proposed ordinance. The Alexander
Withrow House, the oldest building in
downtown Lexington, and the
McCampbell Inn are two such busi-
nesses. They both are furnished with
antiques and each room has a private
bath. Breakfast is included in the price
of the rooms.

Bed and breakfast establishments
offer an alternative to the major
motels and hotels in Lexington. If the
City Council passes the proposed or-
dinance, the number of bed and break-
fast inns in Lexington may greatly in-
crease.

ted me.”’

Vienneau was asked to come badk
and play for America’s Society again
sometime within the next two years.

Vienneau described the experience
of performing at such a prestigious
event: ‘‘Beforehand, it’s like standing
on the edge of a building and havirig
someone expect you to perform tricks,
You question your senility and won-
der ‘what an I doing here; I can’t real-
ly play the piano’. But then once you
are Out on stage, you tend to block
everything else out and concentrage
only on what you are playing.’

Playing the piano has been a major
part of Vienneau’s life. Under his first
teacher, he entered competitions mt
McGill University for 10- and
11-year-olds at the ages of 5 and 6. He
received a scholarship to study at the
Conservatory of Quebec at age 7.
Most students at the conservatory fehl
in the age range between 14 and 22.

While at Quebec, he studied under
Irving Heller, the head of the consef-
vatory piano department. When Heb-
ler left the conservatory, Vienneau
continued under his private tutelage
from age 12 to 16. y

Heller, who has played at Carnegie
Hall, is the artistic director of the
Montreal International Piano Compg,
titions. He also was a judge at the
Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow,
Vienneau described Heller as “very
intense.”’

“*One day he (Heller) brought me ta
the edge of the window when I was
playing something wrong and said,
“You're going to go down.””’ i

At W&L, Vienneau continued in-
struction under Timothy Gaylaré
throughout his undergraduate years.

“I'd love to be a pianist,”’ said
Vienneau. *‘That’s number one on my «*
list, but unfortunately, there’s the
reality of feeding myself. I don’t fit
the role of a starving artisttype.”” _,

He said he hopes to enter major
competitions after his third year of
law school, but can only do so if he,
finds sponsorship.

said.

Wallack also said, ‘‘I wouldn’t rec!

A few facts answered for trivia buffs

 

Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

 

A Washington and Lee education
is definitely NOT a trivial pursuit.
Here is a sampling of questions and
answers to test your knowledge of
Washington and Lee:

Q. What job did Gen. Robert E.
Lee turn down to become the presi-
dent of Washington College in 1865?

A. An insurance company offered
Lee its presidency at an annual salary
of $10,000. Lee declined that position
to accept $1,500 a year as the 12th
president of Washington College. The
school’s trustees had to borrow the
money to pay Lee’s salary the first
year.

Q. Who gave Washington and Lee
its first major endowment gift?

A. In 1796, George Washington
made a gift of $50,000 worth of James
River Canal stock to a struggling insti-
tution named Liberty Hall Academy.
At that time, Washington’s was the
largest endowment gift ever made to a
private educational institution in
America. But more importantly to the
Liberty Hall Academy trustees, the
gift saved the school from financial
ruin. To show their gratitude, the
trustees voted in 1798 to change the
school’s name to Washington College.
That original endowment gift has not
disappeared, either; in 1984-85, each
W&L student received about $3.54
from the gift.

Q. What was the first private insti-
tution of higher education to be com-
memorated on a U.S. postage stamp?

A. In 1949 the U.S. Postal Depart-
ment issued a stamp recognizing
Washnigton and Lee’s bicentennial.
The stamp featured renderings of Lee
and Washington superimposed on the
Colonnade. It was a 3-cent stamp —
good for first class mail back then.

Q. When did Washington and Lee’s
football team last play in a post season
bowl game?

A. The 1950 Generals took an 8-2
record to Jacksonville, Fla, on New
Year’s Day 1951 to play Wyoming’s
Cowboys in the Gator Bowl. Had not
an untimely appendectomy felled the
Generals’ star player, Walt Michaels,
the outcome might have been
different. As it was W&L lost 20-7.
Michaels recovered to become an All-
pro with the Cleveland Browns and a
coach in both the National and United
States football leagues.

Q.What national honor fraternity
was founded at Washington and Lee?

A. In 1914 three Washington and
Lee underclassmen organized the first
chapter of Omicron Delta Kappa in
efforts to recognize the outstanding
leadership on the campus. The frater-
nity annually ‘‘taps’’ or initiates stu-
dents who excel in leadership activi-
ties on W&L’s campus and campuses
throughout the nation.

Q. Where did journalism education
begin?

A. In 1869 at the instigation of
Washington College President Robert
E. Lee, the school offered 50 ‘‘press
scholarships’’ and began instruction in
journalism. The project was part of
Lee’s philosophy that the South’s
greatest need following the Civil War
was informed and competent leader-
ship in commerce, law, government,
engineering and public opinion. That
is why Lee introduced into Washing-
ton College’s classical curriculum in-
struction in commerce, law, engineer-
ing and journalism.

Q. Where does the Washington and
Lee student newspaper get its name?

A. When it began publication in
1897, the Ring-tum Phi was named
for an old football cheer, which began
‘*Ring-tum Phi, stickeri bum! We’re
the stuff from Lexington!”’

Q. What were the last words spoken
by Vice President Alben Barkley and
where did he speak those words?

A. Delivering the keynote address
at Washington and Lee’s Mock De-
mocratic Convention on April 30,
1956, Barkley, vice president under
Truman, thundered, ‘‘I would rather
be a servant in the house of the Lord
than to sit in the seats of the mighty.’’
He then clutched his heart and keeled
over from a heart attack. At the urging
of Barkley’s widow, the Convention
continued a week later, nominating
Adlai Stevenson as the candidate of
the Democartic Party — another cor-
rect prediction for the quadrennial
event, which has now predicted 13 of
18 nominees.

Q. What dies the Latin motto ‘‘Non
incautus futuri’’ on the Washington
and Lee coat of arms mean?

A. Not mindful of the future. The
coat of arms was created by quartering
the Lee and Washington family arms
and adding the Lee motto and the
Washington crest (the figure of the
bird at the top). The bird, incidentally,
is araven.

Q. What is the Washington and Lee

A. No doubt you've heard the
Washington and Lee Swing many
times in the past, but you might not

have realized whose song it really is.
The Swing is particularly unusual
among college fight songs since it is
an original product of the college and
is attributed to a trio of W&L gra-
duates. The tune first was strummed
on a mandolin in 1905 by undergra-
duate Mark Sheafe. The melody was
kept alive after Sheafe’s graduation in
1906 and was eventually published
and copyrighted by student Thornton
W. Allen, ‘11. The words were writ-
ten by Clarence Robbins, ‘11. The
familiar tune has been filched by other
schools ever since and is by most
reckonings the most popular football
song ever written.

Q. What college baseball pitcher is
credited with having thrown the first
curve ball in an intercollegiate game
and for whom did he play?

A. On May 20, 1878, Washington
and Lee pitcher George Augustus
Sykes used his curves to stymie the
University of Virginia’s Wahoos in a
game at Charlottesville. The Wahoos
were not at all happy with Sykes’ in-
vention, calling his curve ‘‘a scurvy
trick.”’

Q. Whose statue stands on the Front
Lawn at Washington and Lee?

A. Cyrus Hall McCormick, a native
of nearby Steele’s Tavern and inven-
tor of the reaper, was recognized by
the university for his generous gifts in
the late 1800s.

Q. What was the budget for Wash-
ington and Lee’s first Fancy Dress
Ball?

A. $47. That was the amount that
Miss Annie Jo White, librarian and
drama instructor, had left from a play
she had directed earlier in the 1907-08

academic year. She decided to put the
money into a costume ball, which
years later become known as the pre-
miere social event of the South.

Q. Where did the yearbook, 7he
Calyx, get its name?

A. According to the 1901 edition of
The Calyx, the name was taken from
the calyx of a flower, signifying that
which encloses what is sweetest and
loveliest.

Q. When was the Washington and

While developing this proposal, the
Health Committee discussed the im-
portance of confidentiality. The com-
mittee members selected a statement,
which allowed other university offi-

a need-to-know basis. The committee
determined, according to psychology
professor Nancy Margand, that a
need-to-know situation did not exist.

The Student Health Committee per-
forms other functions ‘in addition to
creation of the AIDS policy. This
year, the committee has been adopted
to study student health service as part
of the long range planning program.

As advisory, educational and pol-

icy-forming committee, it evaluates
the service provided by the student
health clinic, as well as providing ed-
ucational materials and programs
about AIDS, drugs and other impor-
tant issues.

The committee will investigate the
effectiveness of the clinic hours, staff
numbers and members, the adequacy
of facilities, the health education
efforts, gynecological services, per-
sonal counseling services, athletic
medicine, alcohol policy for overnight
visits in the clinic, the provision of
medication at no cost and the design of

- Sampson throws Generals to 14-10 win

 

By Jim Lake
Staff Reporter

 

BRIDGEWATER W&L foot-
ball’s defense has been outstanding in
1988, but during the fourth quarter
Saturday, it was the offense that
shined, as the Generals rallied for a
14-10 conference win over the
Bridgewater College Eagles.

Despite a slow start for the offense
— the game was scoreless at halftime,
and the Generals (3-3-1) were shut out

“« through three quarters — junior quar-

terback Phil Sampson turned in the

* best performance of his career, lead-

ing W&L on two fourth-quarter

touchdown drives and completing 19

* of 29 passes for 193 yards, one touch-
down and no interceptions.

But while Sampson led the drives,

senior linebacker Tom Skeen made

“them possible by picking off two

‘-* fourth-quarter passes.

The first interception halted the

1 Eagles’ most impressive drive of the
vi afternoon. Running back Anthony
‘e) Lawrence led Bridgewater on a
53-yard drive that gave the Eagles a

« first down at the W&L 3. Quarterback
ti Matt Puryear threw into the end zone

,.on the next play, and Skeen stepped in
vc front of the receiver for his third

interception of the season and the

, ,, eleventh of his career.

Tuesday afternoon. The Washing-

Sampson brought what had been an
ineffective W&L offense to life. The
Generals put on an 80-yard clinic that
took nearly eight-and-a-half minutes
and 16 plays. The classic ball-
possession drive was impressive and
time consuming, but it was also har-
rowing, in that the Generals faced
third down four times and fourth
down once.

But four clutch plays kept the drive
alive. Facing third and seven at his
team’s 23, Sampson found sophomore
slotback Carl Gilbert for a 14-yard
gain. Three plays later, Sampson hit
sophomore split end Craig Irons for
10 yards on third and nine. And three
plays after that, Sampson scrambled
for seven yards on third and four.

But W&L’s third-down magic
didn’t last. On third and three at the
BC 18, sophomore tailback Mason
Pope was stopped after a 2-yard gain.
W&L needed only a yard on fourth
down, but senior tailback Tony Was-
kiewicz picked up two and gave W&L
a first down at the Bridgewater 18.
Two plays later, Pope scampered in
from 16 yards out, and sophomore
Carter Quayle’s kick put the Generals
up 7-3 with 4:46 left.

An excellent kickoff return put the
Bridgewater offense in excellent field
position at the W&L 47, but Skeen’s
second interception of the day and a
14-yard return made it seem like
W&L had iced the game. Instead,
Pope fumbled two plays into the W&L
drive, and the Eagles were back in
business.

And, to his credit, Puryear didn’t let
his two interceptions get to him. The
Bridgewater quarterback threw for all
of a 62-yard drive in only five plays,
including a 14-yard scoring pass to
running back Mike Redmon that gave
the Eagles the lead. Darrell’s extra
point put Bridgewater up 10-7 with
only 1:26 remaining.

Bridgewater's Homecoming crowd
of 2,750 went apoplectic, and the
Generals easily could have folded.
However, according to Sampson, the
W&L offense was virtually unaffec-
ted. Rather than thinking the game
was over, the Generals decided; We’-
ve already come from behind once to-
day, so let’s do it again.

‘Our confidence on that last drive
was just amazing,’’ said Sampson,
who commanded the W&L_ two-
minute offense on what he called the
Generals’ best drive of the season.

W&L started at its own 33 but
quickly picked up 15 yards on a first-
down pass to Irons. But the offense
stalled at midfield and, after three
straight Sampson incompletions,
WA&L faced fourth and ten.

“‘In the huddle, I didn’t see looks of
despair in the faces of the linemen or
the receivers,’’ said Sampson. Cool
under pressure, sophomore split end
Chris Acebal made the catch of his life
near the sideline at the BC 41 to give
WA&L a first down and keep the drive
alive.

‘That was the crucial one,’’ said
head coach Gary Fallon. ‘‘He drops
that or doesn’t get the first down, and

 

very few opportunities, with junior
Ricky Silva having the only two
legitimate scoring chances. A few
minutes into the game, Silva appeared
to score but the officials ruled the ball
did not go into the goal. The second
chance was with five minutes left in
the half. Silva beat the Hornets’ de-
fense but his shot on goal was just off
to the left.

The Generals then started out strong
in the second half. Junior Scott Levitt
sent a nice cross towards the goal for
freshman David De Falco that was
broken up at the last minute by
Lynchburg goalie Rob Simpson. Silva
then blasted a shot off the goalie that
rebounded out. Sarber misfired on an
open net high and wide right as well
and Silva again was stymied by Simp-
son several minutes later.

The missed opportunities would
come back to haunt the Generals.
After Silva’s chance, Lynchburg
moved the ball upfield and scored on
sophomore goalie Jon Bull to go up
2-0. Lynchburg was able to take every
missed General opportunity and turn it
into a fast-break situation.

With the offense sputtering, things
looked grim for the Generals until five
minutes were left in the game. Urso
broke down the right wing with the
ball and saw Sarber flash open in the
middle. Urso’s pass was on the mark,
and Sarber put the Generals on the
board with a shot past a diving Simp-
son.

‘*We passed the ball well in the first
half, and we were a little unlucky,”
Veliuona said. ‘‘We thought we
scored right at the beginning but the
ref said the ball didn’t go in the net. I
think we slowed up a little on defense
in the second half and we had to play
with our backs up against the wall.”’

The Generals had several more op-

portunities after that, but couldn’t
cash in on them. The 2-1 loss dropped
the Generals to 7-6-2 on the season
with one game remaining. The defeat
also gave the Generals a third-place
finish in the ODAC.

On Saturday, W&L defeated high-
ly-rated Millersville in Pennsylvania
2-1. It was a come-from-behind win in
not the greatest of playing conditions.

‘It was our best effort of the year
against an aggressive and talented
team,”’ said Piranian. ‘‘In the first
half against the wind, it would have
been easy to pack it in due to the con-
ditions. They were being very physi-
cal. We hung tough and showed a lot
of character and composure.

‘It was one of the classic wins since
I’ve been coaching here.”’

‘*We played really well in the sec-
ond half and put two balls in the net,””
said Veliuona. ‘‘I felt that if we kept
them to one goal going with the wind
in the first half, that we could score
two goals and we did. We played 90
minutes of soccer for the first time this
season.”*

Urso scored to tie the game and co-
captain Veliuona scored his second
goal of the season, both game-
winners, to give the Generals a hard
fought victory.

As for the seniors, they will be
surely missed next year. Sarber is the
team’s leading scorer this season with
five goals and two assists. For his ca-
reer he has 20 goals and eight assists.
Veliuona has a knack for game-
winning goals. Urso had two goals
and four assists this year and eight
goals and eight assists in his career.
Both Halpert and co-captain Udicious
have provided excellent defense
throughout the year.

we're finished.’’ But Acebal did, and
the Generals weren't.

Three straight first-down passes put
W&L in the end zone. Junior slotback
Scott Jackson hauled in a 23-yarder to
move W&L to the BC 18, and a

sophomore caught while lying on his
back — gave the Generals first-and-

Parents’ Weekend Saturday after-

The Grizzlies are 2-1 against the
Generals after losing last year
21-7. But a new head coach has
brought a new offense, a new de-
fense and new challenges for coach
Gary Fallon’s Generals.

This year’s Ursinus team (2-6,
2-4 in the Centennial Conference)

omore quarterback Brian Thomas,
who averages nearly 200 yards per

“They frighten me for this
reason: they live by the pass,”’ said
Fallon. ‘*The people that play them
haven’t been able to keep them off

Thomas (6-1, 190) has been
named the player of the week in the
Centennial Conference twice this
season. He is a 70 percent passer
(155 completions in 220 attempts)
but has thrown more interceptions
(16) than touchdowns (12). His top
receivers are Joe Czechowicz (6-1,
188), with 37 catches for 565 yards
and four touchdowns, and Kevin
Ross (6-2, 185), who has 34 re-
ceptions for 463 yards and seven
TDs.

Dominion Athletic Conference
Player-of-the-Week. This week he
has been named The Ring- tum Phi
Athlete-of-the-Month.

Tom Skeen, a 5’10°’, 215-pound
senior from Paris, Kentucky has
been chosen by The Ring-tum Phi
as Athlete-of- the-Month for Oc-
tober. Skeen is one of the starting
linebackers and a tri-captain on the
football team. He also shoulders
the punting chores.

Last week against Bridgewater,
Skeen was in on 19 tackles and
intercepted two passes, one in the
end zone to stop a Bridgewater
drive. His play helped the Generals
to a come-from- behind 14-10 win.
Over the past three games, Skeen
has made an unbelievable 46 tack-
les. He is the team’s leader in al-
most every defensive category. He
is currently second on the all-time
interception list (first for lineback-
ers) and he leads the team with four

By Jay Plotkin “Tom is a laid-back individual
Staff Reporter who doesn’t hoot and holler,’’ said
head football coach Gary Fallon.
Last week he was named the Old *‘He knows his ability and respects

those he is around. He is an out-
standing leader by example.”’

Skeen’s most memorable mo-
ment on the field came as a fresh-
man when he caused turnovers on
consecutive possessions. ‘‘It was
the Hampden-Sydney game, and
we were winning late in the first
half. One of their players came
across the middle and I drilled him
and he fumbled. We turned the ball
over right after that, and they were
driving. Then I fiitercepted a pass
in the end zone to stop that drive.”’

‘‘He is thebest linebacker that
has played for us in my 11 years of
coaching here,’’ said Fallon. ‘‘I
just hope someone can step in and
we won’t miss him, but he will
leave some tough shoes to fill. It’s
like how do you replace a good
running back? I think his level of
play will be an inspiration for those
who will follow him and those who
look up to him.”’

Skeen is also a versatile athlete.
Aside from being the leading tack-
ler and interceptor on the team,
with 87 and four respectively, his
punts average 35-yards an effort.

Off the field, Skeen is a business
administration and accounting
major. After graduation, he plans
to work in a small town. ‘‘I'd like
to work in a bank, preferably in a
small town where I can mess
around when I want. I'd also like to

Trojans are likely opponent
for W&L polo in tournament

 

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

Imagine Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler fighting
again here at Washington and Lee. Okay, now substitute
Leonard and Hagler with the University of Arkansas-Little
Rock and Washington and Lee water polo teams. Barring
an unbelievable upset, this will be the matchup in the title
game in the Southern League Championships to be held at
Cy Twombly Pool this weekend.

The tournament will feature W&L, Hampden-Sydney
Richmond and Arkansas. The Generals tangle with Hamp-
den-Sydney at 12:00 in the afternoon on Saturday and play
Richmond at 5:30 that same day. The championship game
is slated for 1:15 p.m. Sunday.

It is hard to picture anyone but the Generals and the Tro-
jans meeting in the finals. These two teams played two
weeks ago in the finals of a tournament in Wilmington,
N.C. and both are the class of the Southern League. Ar-
kansas, ranked 15th in the nation, was victorious in that
matchup as they downed the 18th-ranked Generals 13-8.

But don’t think for a moment that W&L won’t be ready
come Sunday afternoon. Since that earlier defeat, W&L
head coach Page Remillard and his charges have been stu-
dying miles of game tape and been logging extra practice
time in the pool.

‘*The guys have been working very hard,”’ said Remil-
lard, whose team is seeded second, behind the Trojans, in
the Southern League. ‘‘We’ve made some adjustments and
added some wrinkles to our overall game plan.”

But the normally verbose coach would say no more.
Remillard has obviously got a few surprises in store for the
Trojans that he does not want to reveal.

Last year, the two met in a classic confrontation at

Twombly Pool. The Generals, buoyed by a cheering
crowd of around 450 people that reached over 120 decibels
(louder than the Twins’ fans were in the Metrodome dur-
ing last year’s World Series), rallied for a 10-9 victory
over Arkansas-Little Rock.

“The crowd played a large part in our victory last
year,’’ Remillard said. *‘They gave us great support. We
would really benefit from another large crowd this Sun-
day.”’

“It gets you psyched up,”’ said senior co-captain David
Reavy. ‘‘The only time we get to play in front of a large
crowd is at home. It’s a lot more exciting.

“It helps both teams. We just won’t be the only ones af-
fected. It will help us play well as well as help Arkansas-
f Little Rock.’’

The W&L aquatics staff is ready for a big turnout for the
championship match, adding extra seating on the pool
deck.

As far as the future repercussions are concerned, this is
the time of the year when every game becomes more and
more important. With the Eastern Championships rapidly
approaching, the winner of this tournament will most
likely receive a high seed at Easterns. The top two teams
from the Southern League will qualify for next week’s
Eastern Championships.

“*It sets the tone for Easterns,’’ said Reavy. ‘‘We win
this one and we can get things rolling heading into the
Eastern Championships. We might see two teams weaker
than Arkansas in our first two games at Easterns, so it will
give us confidence by winning this one. The higher seed is
also important because it will help us get through the first
round easier.”’

With this on the players’ and coaches’ minds, the teams
head into a tournament in which they are almost destined to
meet in the championship. In the words of Arkansas coach
Richard Turner, ‘*It will be a war!”’

 

 

 

What’s the strategy?

Water polo head coach Page Remillard will try to find a way for

his team to defeat Arkansas-Little Rock.

Cross country teams prepare for conference championship meets

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

The Washington and Lee cross country teams
traveled to Eastern Mennonite last weekend
with more in mind than just running an Old
Dominion Athletic Conference meet. What the
Generals were actually doing was preparing for
Saturday’s conference championships.

W&L will make the same trip this weekend as
the championships will be held at Eastern Men-
nonite. More important, however, will be the
fact that the race will be run on the same course
the Generals just competed on.

‘‘That’s the purpose of running it the week
before,’’ said men’s head coach Dick Miller.
‘*That’s why I scheduled it there. So we could

get a good look at the course and have a compe-,

titive chance on it before we have to run it for
the conference meet. That was our whole pur-

pose.”’

“‘T think for any runner who is less estab-
lished, knowing the course can help,’’ said
women’s head coach Jim Phemister. ‘‘Every
runner is a little more confident and can run that
way. I think it will be a big advantage.”’

In the meet itself, the men’s team, 6-4, lost to
Eastern Mennonite 22-33 but defeated Hamp-
den-Sydney 16-42. Leading the way for the
Generals was senior co-captain Bill Clark, who
finished second in a time of 27:58 on the hilly
five-mile course. Freshmen Charles Edwards
(6th, 28:42) and Lee Parker (7th, 29:27), junior
Joe Geitner (8th, 29:24) and freshman William
Benson (11th, 31:02) were the other scorers for
W&L.

“It’s nice to know the course now,’’ said
Clark, who thought his time was a little slow.
“Tt will definitely help.”’

In the women’s race, the Generals, 4-4, were

competing against the best team in the confer-

ence—Eastern Mennonite. W&L lost:.18-44, but
the surprising thing about the race was not the

score but the performance of sophomore Paige
Cason.

Cason finished eighth in a time of 22:46. But
for the first time when she has run for W&L,
Cason was not the Generals’ top finisher. That
honor belonged to sophomore Cecily Tynan,
who took third place with a time of 21:12 over
the 3. 1-mile course.

‘*Everyone is entitled to a bad race,’’ said
Phemister of Cason’s time. ‘‘She had a particu-
larly tough two or three weeks[academically]
and she responded as expected of someone who
has not been well rested.

“‘Overall, it may have been a good experience
for her because that was the first time a race was
physically difficult for her and yet she worked
through it. It also helped Cecily Tynan, because
that was the first time she has had to lead a
race.’’

Sophomore Heather Jenkins (10th, 23.25),
and seniors Copeland Kapp (11th, 23.56) and
Stephanie Smith (12th, 24.22) were the other

,

three scorers for the Generals.

As for W&L’s chances in the conference
championships, both coaches think that the
Generals will probably finish in third place.

‘‘Eastern Mennonite and Lynchburg are real-
ly running for first and second, and I think
everybody else is running for third,’ said Mil-
ler of the men’s field. ‘‘{Clark] has as good a
chance as anyone of winning it all.”’

In the women’s field, Phemister sees Eastern
Mennonite and Lynchburg as the top two teams
as well, but will not be disappointed with his
team’s effort if it should happen to end up in
third.

“We're not only getting better every year,
but also getting proportionately better to the
other teams,”’ he said. ‘*We are closing the gap
on the other teams,”’

Cason is the defending ODAC champion and
was named the conference Runner-of-the-Year
last season.

Volleyball
sets itself
for ODACs

by Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

 

The W&L women’s volleyball team
has finished up regular season play.
Last Thursday night the team split
with Bridgewater and Bluefield at
home. Bridgewater, ranked number
one in the region, defeated the Gen-
erals decisively, but the team rallied to
beat Bluefield in two straight games.
Saturday afternoon the Generals went
on the road and lost to Guilford in
three straight.

The women are now preparing for
the ODAC Championships to be held
at Emory and Henry on Nov. 4-5.
Only the top eight of the 10 ODAC
teams are invited to the tournament,
and the Generals earned a berth by fin-
ishing up fifth in conference play. The
team’s overall record was 15-9 and
4-5 in conference.

The Generals are in the
bracket with Bridgewater, Emory and
Henry and Mary Baldwin. All three
are teams that have posted wins over
the Generals during regular season.

After the tournament, the team will
graduate its first seniors. Head Coach
Susan Dittman on the seniors:

Melissa Thrasher: ‘‘Melissa has
been with the program all three years.
She was the key to getting women’s
volleyball started at W&L.”’

Vanessa Hartman: ‘‘Vanessa has
played all three years and is the
hardest worker on the team. She did
not play varsity in high school, and
has come a long way.”’

Amy Smith: ‘‘Amy has been with
the team for two years. Before ‘that,
she had never played volleyball: She
is definitely the most improved player
on the team.”’

Jessica Reynolds: ‘‘Jessica’ has
played all three years. She turned in
impressive games against Hollins and
Emory and Henry. Though she does
not always see a lot of action, she has
a lot of spirit and is willing to do
whatever is necessary to help: the
team.” :

Steve Baldridge: ‘‘Steve has been
invaluable as a student coach. He‘was
instrumental in getting the women’s
volleyball program started. ’’

Parents are taken for granted.

For the fourth year in a row now, my parents are com-
ing down from Pennsylvania for Parent’s Weekend.
They will read this column, as they have read every other
column and sports story I have ever written. They will
also read everything I write in the future.

Parents are a strange phenomenon. This weekend I'll
look into the crowd at the football game and see the par-
ents of almost every player, watching their son. It doesn’t
matter if their kid gets in or not, they'll sit on those un-
comfortable benches and watch. And be proud.

Think of all the times your parents came to see you
play in one of your games. My parents went to every
single home basketball game (and even some on the road)
when I was in high school, even though my chances of
seeing any playing time were worse than winning the
Virginia lottery. They didn’t care if I played or not.
Neither did any of the other parents.

It’s amazing how much influence parents can have on
the athletic growth or development of a person. There are
the parents who are coaches, making their kids practice
for hours on end before the child is even old enough to
know what the words commitment and sacrifice mean.
There are the parents who are teachers, giving little poin-
ters here and there in an attempt to help you be a better
player. And then, regrettably, there are the parents who
are uncaring, distancing themselves from their child’s
endeavors. It seems ironic that some of the best athletes
come from broken homes. Even a negative influence can
have a positive outcome.

When you are out there—wrapped up in the competi-
tion—our parents aren’t noticeable, just one of the
several specks in a sea of faceless individuals. But when
its over, there they are, ready to congratulate or console
depending upon the result of the game. Again, it doesn’t
matter how you played or if you played or even if your
team won or lost. What matters is that you were a part of

 

Se. eee
Mom and Dad really

make a difference

 

the team that played.

Unconditional love is a strange, illogical thing. People
talk about ‘‘earning’’ respect from another person or
‘deserving’ a reward for some completed task. Uncon-
ditional love is not earned or deserved but rather given.
No one demands it and no one works for it. Your parents
just give it to you, no questions asked.

Do me a favor if your parents come down to see you
this weekend. Let them know how grateful you are for all
the times they have been there for you—and only
you—when you needed them. Believe it or not, they have
done more for you than you can possibly imagine.

It’s funny how our attitudes change when we get to col-
lege and spend a few years away from home. Before, you
hoped your parents wouldn’t embarrass you in front of
your friends or would be ‘‘like other parents’’ and give
you a | a.m. curfew. Now, I look at my parents and
think, ‘They sure are cool.’’ I guess that’s what you call
growing up.

NOTES—I don’t know if this is necessary, but support
W&L water polo on Sunday in its match against Arkan-
sas- Little Rock. The crowd made a difference last year
and it’s so nice to see a little school enthusiasm for an ath-
letic event... Congratulations to Jan Hathorn for winning
ODAC Coach-of-the- Year. She has brought the
women’s soccer program a long way in just two years of
varsity competition and the outlook for next season is just
as bright... Is Larry Brown scum or what? First he ad-
mits he knew Kansas committed NCAA recruiting viola-
tions but didn’t think them major enough to report them.
Then he has the audacity to say he would have stayed at
Kansas (he’s now the coach of the San Antonio Spurs) if
he had known that the NCAA was going to levy such a
harsh penalty. Don’t call us, Larry, we'll call you when
we want you to give a lecture on integrity...

“Animal House’’is your choice for No.1

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

I must say, this has been a real ex-

perience. It has been a great deal of

fun seeing what films you thing are the

best ever. Not surprisingly, none of

my top ten made your top ten but E.T.
did make the top 15.

Your top ten is made up of great
movies from top to bottom. In fact,
the top ten films you chose have won
24 Academy Awards between them.
Five are comedies, three are ac-
tion/adventure and two are dramas.
Each film has some aspect of excel-

lence and all are worthwhile viewing

experiences. Though your picks for
25 to 15 are not quite as wonderful, I
_Suppose each of them has some merit
as well (although in a couple I’m not
«so sure.)

So now, without further ado, here
Washington and Lee are your top 25

favorite films of all-time. And thank
you for your support.

“it

#25. Angel Heart (1987, Dir. Alan
Parker)

Interesting plot-twisting film starring
.Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro and
Lisa Bonet in her first and most con-
troversial film role. Rourke plays two-
bit private eye hired by DeNiro to find
a missing man that Rourke eventually
wishes he had never found. Frighten-
ine images and intriguing plot turns.

FA very good watch.

P24. The Wizard of Oz (1939, Dir.
- Victor Fleming)

Classic American film about Kansas
farmgirl (Judy Garland) who goes
over the rainbow into the land of Oz
where she meets the scarecrow (Ray
Bolger) the tin man (Jack Haley), the
cowardly lion (Bert Lahr) and the
Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret
Hamilton). A must see for any serious
film buff or any true film lover.

23. The Terminator (1984, Dir. James
Cameron)
First and best of the Schwarzeneggar
films about a cyborg sent back in time
to kill the hope for the future. Intel-
igent script and relentless drama
nake this film a delight to watch. Just
s good the second and third times as

  

 

it is the first.

22. Top Gun (1986, Dir. Tony Scott)
The most expensive navy recruitment
film in history. Great flight sequences
and adequate storyline. Tom Cruise,
Anthony Edwards, Meg Ryan and Ke-
lly McGillis all give fine performan-
ces. Fun film to watch but a real buzz
crush for all those people who saw it
and signed up to fly jets and who are
now scraping barnacles off battleships
in the Persian Gulf.

21. Stripes (1981, Dir. Ivan Reitman)
Hilarious Bill Murray yarn about an
army unit out of control. Murray is a
scream as usual as are Harold Ramis
and John Larroquette. Good early per-
formances by Judge Reinhold and
John Candy as well. Very fun film to
watch.

20. The Natural (1984, Dir. Barry
Levinson)

Definitely one of the most cliche films
ever made but a beautiful film to
watch. Acted superbly by Robert Red-
ford, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger,
Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Bar-
bara Hershey and the rest of this all-
star cast. One of those films that
makes you stand up and cheer even
though you know what’s going to
happen.

19. Brazil (1985, Dir. Terry Gilliam)
Demented black comedy about a bleak
futuristic society. Directed by Monty
Python alum Gilliam which shows.
Very imaginative and complex but de-
finitely worth watching.

18. The Big Chill (1983, Dir.
Lawrence Kasdan)

Wonderful introspective look at a
group of old college friends who reun-
ite for one of their collegemates fu-
neral, An all-star cast including Tom
Berenger, Glenn Close, William Hurt
and Kevin Kline is superb as is the
60's soundtrack that accompanies the
script. Much like a St. Elmo’s Fire on
an adult level, but better.

17. It’s a Wonderful Life (1946, Dir.
Frank Capra)

One of American filmes real treasures
made by one of America’s finest di-
rectors with one of America’s finest

actors in the lead. Jimmy Stewart is
superb as is Henry Travers as Clar-
ence. This is as much a Christmas
classic as Miracle on 34th St.,A
Christmas Carol or the Grinch.

16. Dr. Penetration (Who knows, who
cares)

Hopefully a poor sequel to Ian Flem-
ming’s Dr. No, Richard Fleischer’s
Doctor Dolittle or Stanley Kubrick's
Dr. Strangelove, but I doubt it. Sorry.
Haven't seen it.

15. Deep Throat (same clown as 116
probably)

The first of the widespread films fea-
turing carnal artistry as its subject
matter. Virtually quite a simplistic
film whose plot summary unfolds in
the first, say, 30 seconds. With this ti-
tle, film should have been about a
sword swallower. It would probably
have been more exciting and far more
interesting intellectually.

14. E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982,
Steven Spielberg)

My pick for number one without ques-
tion. Enchanting film about the love
between a young boy (Henry Thomas)
and an orphaned alien who he be-
friends. Touching film that really tugs
on the old heartstrings no matter how
many times you have seen it. Already
the number one grossing film of all-
time.

13. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest
(1975, Dir. Milos Forman)

Fantastic film about the triumph of the
human spirit starring Jack Nicholson
and Louise Fletcher who both won
Oscars for their performances. Film
also won Best Picture, Screenplay and
Director designating it as one of the
few films in history to ever win all
five top awards at the Academy
Awards.

12. Debbie Does Dallas (19??, Dir.
I.M. Demented)

Terribly boring film about the statisti-
cian for the Dallas Cowboys football
team, and for the Dallas police de-
partment and other various estab-
lishments around the Dallas area.

11. Casablanca (1942, Dir. Michael
Curtiz)

No question one of the finest motion
pictures ever made. Humphrey Bogart
and Ingrid Bergman and incredible as
is the film as a whole. One of those
films you watch and can’t believe just
how good it really is. Full of wonder-
fully rememberable lines and an un-
forgettable performance by Dooley
Wilson singing ‘‘As Time Goes By.”’

10.Rocky (1976, Dir. John G. Avild-
sen)

Wonderfully inspirational film about a
down and out boxer who gets a shot at
the heavyweight championship of the
world. All around fine performances
by everyone in the all-star cast. Be-
lieve it or not Stallone got an Oscar
nomination as Best Actor. Too bad he
plays every part like Rocky or he
might get another one. Bill Conti's
music and theme especially remain
some of the most popular and inspir-
ing film music in history.

9. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981, Dir.
Steven Spielberg)

Non-stop action/adventure film star-
ring Harrison Ford that took America
by storm. Visual effects justifiably
won an Academy Award but Speil-
berg was again snubbed as the direct-
ing award went to Warren Beatty for
Reds. To this day, there may not be
another film to top Raiders enthusiasm
or energy in effects.

8. The Blues Brothers (1980, Dir.
John Landis)

Outlandish, hilarious comedy about
Jake and Elwood Blues (John Belushi
and Dan Ackroyd) and the Blues
Brother band they assemble to raise
money for the mortgage on the or-
phanage they were raised in. Belushi
and Ackroyd are priceless in their
finest roles as is the plethora of musi-
cal legends they run into along the
way such as James Brown, John Lee
Hooker, Aretha Franklin, Cab Cal-
loway and Ray Charles. A must see to
anyone who loves to laugh.

7. Apocaylpse Now (1979, Dir. Fran-
cis Coppola)

Coppola’s controversial VietNam epic
heavily based on Joseph Conrad’s
Heart of Darkness. Marlon Brando,
Robert Duvall and Martin Sheen all
give fine performances. Film contains

we 2

SERVIC,

What do Bill Holmes,

many memorable and disturbing
scenes, but a must see.

6. Gone With the Wind (1939, Dir.
Victor Fleming)

Fleming had quite a year directing this
and The Wizard of Oz. Considered by
many to be the greatest film of all-time
and by all means the finest war epic,
and southern epic of all- time. Clark
Gable and Vivien Leigh and just won-
derful in the leads. She won the Best
Actress award while Hattie McDaniel
won the Best Supporting Actress
award. Masterful storytelling and a
phenomenal, almost flawless film.

5. Star Wars (1977, Dir.
Lucas)

The film that almost single-handedly
caused the explosion in film making
about space. Though nuked by Annie
Hall for Best Picture at the Oscars, it
was by far the most popular film of the
year and maybe the decade. Spawned
two sequels that were better than the
original. The trilogy on the whole is
masterful and a real film treasure.

George

4. Caddyshack (1980, Dir. Harold
Ramis)

Hilarious look at a country club and an
eccentric (Rodney Dangerfield) who
invades it. Film is quite funny overall
with Dangerfield, Chevy Chase and
Ted Knight in the two leads but Bill
Murray steals the film as the greens-
keeper. Film appears a little old now
but will still put you in stitches.

3. Monty Python and the Holy Grail
(1974, Dir. Terry Gilliam)

Cult classic that is very typically
Monty Python humor. Scene after
scene is priceless, however and will
keep you rolling if you are in the
mood to see the film. Much more fun
to watch with a group of people than
alone. A definite film to see for those
enjoying dry, black comedy and those
enjoying Monty Python especially.

 

2. Fletch (1985, Dir. Michael Ritchie)
This may be Chevy Chase's finest
film role as an undercover reporter.
Though it doesn’t necessarily need to
be carried, Chase carries this film off
maximizing its full comedic potential
while not going overboard. A lot of
fun to say the least.

1. Animal House (1978, Dir. John
Landis)

Quite appropriately your number one
pick of all-time considering it is hands
down ‘‘the’’ college film of all-time.
Probably Belushi’s greatest single per-
formance. You can watch this film 20
times (as I'm sure many of you have)
and you'll still find it as funny as the
last time you saw it. Scene after scene
is absolutely perfect. If you haven't
seen it since coming to college, see it
again. You'll have a whole new ap-
preciation for it.

Well, there you go. Your top 25
favorite films of all-time. I hope you
have enjoyed this little poll and thank
you to all the people who participate.
Have a happy and safe weekend with
your parents.

Beethoven and Jane

releaseimpressive LPs

 

By Pat Heffernan and Mike Graf
Staff Reporter

 

Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweeth-
eart( Virgin) is the long awaited follow
up to Camper van Beethoven’sTele-
phone Free Landslide Victory his is a
coming of age album for the Califor-
nia quintet

Our Beloved \acks the outright silli-
ness of its predecessor, but it is still
marked by creative genius. The band
keeps its folk rock sound while adding
more studio polish and maturity. This
change is most evident on the album’s
fourth cut, ‘She Divines Water.”
Jonathan Segel’s wailing violin and
Greg Lisher’s crafted guitar chords
are intertwined with tape splices and
dubs. The end result is a powerful
combination of creativity and crafts-
manship. The song climaxes in a cres-
cendo of studio effects only to close
with an acoustic solo.

Other tracks do not rely on as much
technical assistance but do continue to
reflect the band’s new found maturity.
The record starts with ‘‘Eye of Fatima
(Pts. 1 & 2),’’ arguably its best song.
In Part 1, Victor Krummenacher's
bass riffs lead the way into an ethereal
world of insight via hotel room art.
Par 2 hints at the Campers’ punk past
as driving guitars re-interpret the ori-
ginal melody.

Other highlights include ‘‘O
Death’? with its funeral march beat,
the raucous folk stomp of ‘“Turquoise
Jewelry,”’ the guitar-rich instrumental
‘*Waka,”’ and the plaintive vocals and
simple melody of ‘‘Life is Grand.”
Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweeth-

eart finds Camper van Beethoven ex-
ploring new territory, away from the
joke rock of the past. The final pro-
duct is no different, though an out-
standing album from one of the most
exciting and innovative bands on the
progressive music scene today.

Jane’s Addiction is a band that has
realized where progressive rock is
moving and has taken the
lead.Nothing’s Shocking (Warner
Bros.) is currently number three on
most college rock charts and number
one in the southern region for college
radio airplay. The strength of the
album lies in its recognizable com-
ponents and its unmistakable origina-
lity. The album has a diversity of
sound within each song, but is held
together by an overall mood. The
songs vary form the straightforward
rock of ‘‘Had a Dad”’ to the frenetic
horns of ‘‘Idiots Rule.’’ Tracks like
‘*Mountain Song’” immediately recall
the Cult with their mystic and disjoin-
ted lyrics and the sporadic and omni-
present snare drum.

Bluesy songs like ‘Ted, Just Admit
It’’ reflect their roots and the popular
‘‘Jane Says’’ has a back porch acous-
tic guitar sound that recalls the best of
progressive and classic rock. *‘Ocean
Size’’ reveals the depth of Jane’s Ad-
diction. The slow acoustic intro, the
screaming and then surprisingly me-
lodic vocals, the properly placed
guitar fill, and the snare (again,shades
of the Cult) epitomize the album.

Nothing's Shocking is an album that
demands an audience. This is the fore-
front of the next progression in pro-
gressive music.
