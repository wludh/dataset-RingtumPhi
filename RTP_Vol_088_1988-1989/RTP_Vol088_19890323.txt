‘Men take 8th in NCAAs

é

When Washington and Lee’s
‘David Olson stepped up to the
starting blocks for the
,championship heat of the 200-yard
‘packstroke at last week’s Division
_/lll Men’s Swimming National
~ Championships, his mental
“processes were in overdrive.

* One of the favorites in the
,competition, Olson was preparing
himself much the same way
‘baseball players or high jumpers
«get ready to hit a pitch or clear a
bar, through positive mental
‘imagery.

« “I ty to picture the. race,”
Olson said. “‘I try to plan how
‘I'm going to swim the race. I
‘knew [prior to the heat] who was
«going to be there and that it was
going to be tough. I just wanted
‘to swim my race and not make
yany mistakes.’

He didn’t. Olson led from
‘start to finish in the 200 back,
rshattering his own school record
ywith a time of 1:53.14 and
becoming W&L’s first individual
‘national champion since 1977 and
,the school’s third overall.

The junior also earned NCAA D-
‘III All-America status five times
«during the championships, en route

 

to leading the Generals to an
eighth-place finish in the final team
standings. W&L scored 170
points, three points behind seventh-
place Denison and 16 points ahead
of ninth-place Johns Hopkins.
Kenyon won its 10th straight
national title, finishing with a team
total of 630.5 points.

After all the swimming was
completed, Olson swam away with
All-America honors in five events:
the 200 back, the 200 individual
medley, the 100 back, the 200
medley relay and the 400 medley

relay.
But Olson was not the only
General to ‘shine at the

championships held at Bowdoin
College in Brunswick, Maine.
W&L received All-America (first
through eighth place) or Honorable
Mention - All-America (ninth
through 16th place) from six other
individuals. Senior Jeff Bercaw in
the 100 butterfly (15th), junior
Shawn Copeland in the 200
breaststroke (12th) and freshman
Jay Smith in the 100 freestyle
(14th) were W&L’s other
individual stars.

As for the relays, the All-
America 200 and 400 medley relay

teams (eighth and _— seventh

respectively) consisted of Olson,
Bercaw, Copeland and Smith; the

400 free relay team (fifth) was
made up of Bercaw, Smith, senior
captain David Reavy and freshman
Chip Nordhoff; the 800 free relay
team (eighth) was Copeland,
Reavy, Nordhoff and sophomore
Jim Dunlevy; and the 200 free
relay team (12th) was comprised of
Reavy, Bercaw, Smith and
Nordhoff.

Senior David Dietz had to leave
the championships after Thursday
moming’s competition for personal
reasons.

‘‘We pulled together as a team,”
said Reavy. ‘‘It was a total team
effort.”’

John Hudson, who won both the
500- and 1650-yard freestyle events
at the 1976 NCAA D-III National
Championships, is W&L’s only
other individual national swimming
champion. Olson is the third
W&L athlete ever to earn an
individual national crown. The
only other individual D-III national
champion in the school’s history
was the men’s tennis doubles team
of Stewart Jackson and Ben Johns,
which won the D-III national
doubles title in 1977.

W&L’s eighth-place team finish
tied the best ever performance at
nationals for a W&L swimming

team. The Generals came in

Investigation

No suspects have been found in
the continuing investigation of the
hit-and-run accident that killed
freshman Mary Ashley
Scarborough last Thursday,
according to Lexington Police
Chief Bruce Beard.

Beard said the only evidence
found at the scene was a_ horn
cover from the underside of the
front bumper of a 1987 metallic
blue Honda Accord.

Paint samples found on
Scarborough’s clothing are being
analyzed to determine the exact
color of the car that hit her, and
the results should be known by
Friday, Beard said.

An autopsy has been performed
to determine the exact ‘‘blow of
the body that killed her,’’ said
Beard, but the results will not be
released until a later date. He said
the main reason for the autopsy
was that the police ‘‘don’t know

Hodges, who organizes the
institutes in’ each of the applied
ethics programs of medicine, law,

lawyers in the country, who also
knows Rice. Hodges spoke with
Rice in January and extended to

EC actions

Although it has yet to be
officially presented, a new report
has been released that is causing a
str in the Executive Committee
office.

Led by Anne Schroer-Lamont,
associate dean of students, the
Self-Study Committee on Student
Activities recently completed a
report that criticized several
Executive Committee practices.
These criticisms included the belief
that the EC may have too many
responsibilities which hinder them
from operating effectively, and that
there is an irregular allocation of
EC funds to many student groups.

The self-study committee has
recommended several changes for
next year. It asks that the EC
create written policies outlining
which groups qualify for EC funds,
and that all student organizations
be organized under umbrella
groups according to their related

— i functions. Finally, the report states

Three weeks ago, second-year law
student Hugh Finkelstein and
sophomore’ Willard Dumas
campaigned for student body
president and vice-president on the
platform that the EC _ needed
written guidelines for allocating
funds.

“Currently the EC refuses
funding to political, religious and
social groups that do not represent
the student body as a whole,”’ said
Dumas. He added that because no
written guidelines exist, it comes
down to the opinion of the
Executive Committee on who does

Don’t canonize Duke’s opponents -

 

MY VIEW
By Charles Gay

 

Seldom has a local election
commanded national attention the
way that the race for a seat in the
Louisiana state legislature did last
month. The victory of a former
Grand Wizard of the Knights of.
the Ku Klux Klan in_ the
predominantly white New Orleans
suburb of Metaire has raised a
storm of outrage among journalists,
black leaders, and the Republican
Party, whose banner David Duke
ran under. Duke calls for an end
to affirmative action and a
reassertion of white rights, appeals
for which he is branded with the
moral-political leprosy -- racism.
However, many of Duke’s
adversaries have considerably less
lofty motives for attacking him.

Although Duke’s_ past
associations with the Klan and a
neo-Nazi group were undeniably
racist, his current rhetoric is mild.
Affirmative action and minority
set-aside programs are his chief
targets. Presumably, programs like
affirmative action are designed to
balance the previous
discriminations that blacks and
other minorities have suffered in
this country. However, as Duke
argues, most whites who are
passed over for less qualified

job are not guilty of any
discrimination in their lives and are
in fact victims themselves of
discrimination, or ‘‘reverse
racism.”’ Because ‘‘the system’’
has succumbed to the lobbying of
minorities in instituting
black/minority-favoring programs,
Duke mentions that men _ like
himself must step forward to assert
white rights. There is no moral
right or wrong in this race issue,
only a power struggle between
rival groups.  That’s why it’s
called politics.

irrelevant) domain of morality.
Black politicians and other

leaders are bound to oppose Duke,
because their black constituency
demands that they do, and because
they would fall from grace if they
delayed a second. Still, there is a
more elemental reason--the power
struggle. At present, affirmative

The real Rice

 

MY VIEW
By Rob MacPherson

 

Rare is a Saturday afternoon in
Lexington when one gets the
chance to have a drink with a
young lady who played a major
role in the demise of a presidential

candidate; however, such an
opportunity presented itself to
several Washington and Lee

students this past weekend, myself
included.

Donna Rice, the “‘model/actress/
partygirl’’ whose infamous
rendezvous with Gary Hart forced
him to withdraw from the 1988
presidential campaign, spent a few
hours last Saturday telling students,
faculty, lawyers and _ professional
journalists how the conduct of the
latter caused her to go from being
a sales representative with a
pharmaceutical company to a
volunteer with a non-profit
organization.

Also, in order to operate in her
present societal capacity without
being hounded by the media, she
occasionally (and not because she
likes the fit) sports false buck teeth
and... sunglasses to alter her
appearance. Basically, as a result
of press coverage of an isolated
incident in which she herself was
not the thrust of the story, Donna

Rice has been denied the
unalienable right to pursue
happiness.

A. major topic of discussion
during the 15th Annual Institute on
the Ethics of Journalism at
Washington and Lee University,
the event which prompted Miss
Rice’s surprise visit to the Big
Lex, was an individual’s right to
privacy and the consequences that
often result from its constant clash
with the First Amendment, which
guarantees freedom of the press.
The clash occurs because neither
of the parties involved, the public
and the press, wants to forfeit any
of the benefits they enjoy from the
current arrangement of coexistence.

At the institute, Miss Rice
served as a living example of what
can result from _ irresponsible
journalism. Because of the way
she was treated in the media, she
lives her life according to what she
can get away with, without having

to hold a press conference at every
street comer. She has tried to tell
her story and clear her name, but
each attempt has done nothing to
change the false public perception
of this Phi Beta Kappa student
who many have been told is a
mere ‘‘model/actress/partygirl.”’

It is not the fault of society
that the name Donna Rice often
makes people think of the word
‘‘bimbo.”’ Nor is it the fault of
Miss Rice. After all, she is well
educated and has already shown
that she can be a_ successful
‘‘woman of the ‘80s.”’ The fault
rests in the hands of the media and
those journalists who routinely
abuse the power of the press. A
fair assessment of the woman who
is blamed for ruining Gary Hart’s
political career would be to
describe her as what she is, not
what the media thinks the public
wants to see, hear and read.

If I had never met Donna Rice,
I would be among the many who,
almost two years after she was in
the limelight, still believe she got
what she deserved. Having met
her, I can plead ignorance for
arriving at my previously held
beliefs. I was merely reacting to
what I was told by the mighty
media in whom I had placed a
great deal of trust and of whom I
expected nothing but complete
accuracy.

Was I wrong to think that I
could turn to the media for an
authentic view of the world around
me? Being a journalism major,
I’m inclined to say ‘‘no.’’ Were
the media wrong for painting me a
picture of my world which did not
tell the whole story? Being a
human being, I’m inclined to say
“tyes.’” I do not believe Donna
Rice is a saint and the press
should be damned for having
introduced her to us. Rather, I
firmly believe that her behavior in
1987 warranted press coverage,
especially when one considers with
whom she was sharing moonlit
evenings. My point is that I
should not have to meet such a

another pretty face’’ nor should it
take two years for this information
to surface. One should not feel

to deliver the whole story. After
all, what else is there?

at their disposal, the bigotry tag.
Attempting to battle Duke on the
grounds of his current rhetoric
would be too risky and more
difficult, so black politicians
merely cry ‘‘Klan’’ and the
moralists/idealists are in their back
pockets. Just prior to Duke’s
being sworn into office in Baton
Rouge two of the state’s black
representatives walked out on the
legislature, swearing not to come
back until Duke was somehow

tried .to shroud its opposition ,to
Duke in patriotic as well as moral
garb. Republican _ national
chairman Lee Atwater piously
condemned Duke as unworthy of
“the party of Abraham Lincoln
and George Bush (!)’’ labelling
him ‘‘an enemy of America.”
Atwater neglected to mention his
campaign to bring more black
voters into the Republican Party,
and the fact that Duke’s association
with the party would probably
damage his chances. The political
angle of the issue was belied by
the fact that President Bush
publicly and strenuously endorsed
Duke’s opponent in the election
race, which is virtually unheard of
in such a small-scale campaign.
Why else would the Republican
Party be so interested? it
obviously feared that Duke would
drive away potential voters from
the party at large.

The victory of David Duke in a
Louisiana state legislature race was
too minor an event for so man
people to get so upset about it.
Clearly, Duke’s opponents have
found it convenient to ignore the
issues and make themselves look
good by condemning him, all ih
the name of some ‘‘higher ideals.’;

_ According to Worth, grief over a death of a
friend or peer is a very disruptive period for an
individual. He said, “‘It’s a time when people do
things they don’t normally do.

“‘Some people cry, some are withdrawn, some
analyze the situation and others don’t get any sleep.
There’s no one way to deal [with grief).””

According to Worth, there are three stages a
person goes through in the grieving process. The
first phase is disbelief that death has occurred and
the second is a reaction to the death: Worth said
each person reacts different'y, but the key
component in this phase is anger. He said
community support services can be invaluable during
this time.

The third phase in the grieving process is
acceptance, Worth said. He said the initial feelings
of shock and anger are replaced by an appreciation
of the person who died. He also said a deeper
awareness of life or the recognition of life as

The recent death of a freshman in a hit-and-run
accident in Lexington has rocked the W&L campus.

At the time of the accident, both university
psychologists, Dr. James Worth and Anne Schroer-
Lamont, were out of town attending confebences.
However, according to Worth, the Southern
Seminary counselor, Molly Messimen, was called at
7 a.m. on Thursday and spent 20 hours of her own
time talking to W&L deans and students who
needed an ear. Worth said Messimen interned at
W&L under his direction.

Asked why the university was ‘‘hit very hard’’
by the tragedy, Worth said it came at a bad time,
before exams, in ‘‘crummy’’ weather and the
violent, pointless nature of the accident made people
think twice about the situation. He also said that
since the accident occurred in a place that so many
people pass, makes them think it could have been

Barefeet and grass.
A ham sandwich,
An early moming drive.

Simple pleasures. In the world of Al McGuire,
simple pleasures are what life is all about. The NBC
broadcaster and former head basketball coach
emphasized the importance of this ideal to an
estimated crowd of 300 students last Thursday night
in Lee Chapel.

He also stressed the necessity of dreaming.

“Whatever you want to do you can do,” said
McGuire, whose Marquette team won the NCAA
Division I men’s basketball championship in 1977,
his final season as head coach. ‘‘You have to do
your work, but your dreams -- they can come true.

“To this day I dream. I always wanted to be a

coach. I’m telling you, whatever you dream will
become a reality. Like who you are, be yourself
and dream.”

McGuire drifted from subject to subject, mainly
because he doesn’t use notes but ‘“‘works by
wristwatch.’’ He often lost his train of thought but
he never lost his hypnotic power and control over
the audience. His talk was extremely informal,
almost as if Lee Chapel were a big living room and
McGuire had come over to sit on the couch and
chat for a while about life and college basketball.
All that was missing was the fire in the fireplace.

Because he talks ‘‘in pictures, not in words,”’
McGuire’s speech, if you want to call it that, does
not allow itself to be easily paraphrased. Instead, it
was similar to a philosopher stating his views on the
meaning of life. So, here are Al McGuire’s views
on:

-The Bill Frieder/Michigan situation. ‘‘You
have to realize that, in life, a person must take an
opportunity in life when it comes along. Arizona
State is in the minus pool, they don’t have anything,
and I guess they had to make a move because they
can’t miss this freshman class completely. There’s a

m@ Have a ham sandwich on Al

time to move on. I think the ideal thing in the
coaching profession is that every five years a coach
changes jobs.”’

-The NCAA’s policy not allowing an athlete,
who has signed a letter of intent for one school,
to transfer after learning that school’s coach has
left without losing a year of eligibility. ‘‘The
NCAA is wrong on that. If a head coach leaves,
nobody [Frieder] recruited should be allowed to go
to Arizona State with him, but the ball players he
has signed should be allowed to go to any school
that they have visited. A ball player can visit five
schools. Allow that young gentleman or that young
lady to visit one more school, and then make a pick
of those five schools to go to. You do go to a
university a lot of times because of the coach and
his style of play.’’

-The alleged bias toward big conferences when
selecting teams for the NCAA tournament. ‘“‘I
think that each conference should not be allowed to
put in more than four teams, with the exception that
one of the bottom teams wins the post season

conference tournament. We're building super
conferences and we’re not spreading the wealth
around.,”’

-Proposition 48 and 42. “They are not

discriminatory, in my opinion. I think the testing is
discriminatory, as far as not only to minorities but
also regional. I think there are other parts of the
country that can’t qualify academically to that
standard. I still think Proposition 42 will fly
through. I think this was an overreaction because of
John Thompson. I believe you are supposed to use
sports, not let sports use you.’’

-The best player ever. ‘‘The best player who
ever played the game is Kareem Adbul-Jabbar. The
best player ever, pound for pound, was the Big O,
Oscar Robertson.”’

-The top 5 NBA lottery picks. 1)Pervis Ellison,
Louisville; 2)Danny Ferry, Duke; 3)Stacey King,
Oklahoma; 4)Sean Elliot, Arizona; and 5)Tom
Hammonds, Georgia Tech.

-Life. ‘‘Give people a chance. Communicate.
Without talking you aren’t going any place in your
life. Life’s a piece of cake. For you to blow your
lives is insanity.”’

Previewing the 1989 Oscars

Rain Man and Dangerous Liaisons look for big wins

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

When one considers the thousands of
elements that go into creating a motion
picture, it is truly amazing that any are ever
completed. Like a child, a film starts small
and miraculously grows into something that
can exist without the support of those who
created it. It is from that point forward that
the world begins to judge and to decide who
or which is the strongest and who or which is
the weakest.

In the world of motion pictures, the finest
films, actors, actresses, technicians, musicians
and directors of 1988 have been chosen and
Geemed worthy of an award nomination from
the American Motion Picture Academy of Arts
and Sciences. It is now time to decide who or
what is the absolute best.

After coming off somewhat weak film
years in 1986 and 1987, 1988 proved to be
the finest year for film since 1984 when A
Passage to India, The Killing Fields, Places
in the Heart and A Soldier’s Story lost out
to Amadeus for Best Picture.

The quality films in 1988 showcased many
ol Hollywood’s finest professionals but also
introduced a plethora of new faces and styles,
Looking at the 20 nominations in the four
acting categories for instance, 12 are first-time
nominations- new faces and new talent. On
the other hand, the 25 men and women
nominated for acting and directing oscars
already have 47 nominations and seven awards
between them.

There is of course a down side to all of
this and that is that in only giving five
nominations in each category, some people
had :to be left out. People like Penny Marshall
(Big), Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons)
and’ Clint Eastwood (Bird) in the direction
category, William Hurt (The Accidental
Tourist), Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?), Forest Whitaker (Bird) and John
Malkovich (Liaisons) in the acting categories,
and Elizabeth Perkins (Big), Tim Robbins,
Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon (Bull
Durham) in the supporting categories all
delivered excellent performances but were left
out.

The lines have been drawn though and
now it is time to move on to the nominees
for this year’s 61st annual Academy Awards
ceremony. Since there are some discrepancies
between who the academy will give the
awards to and who I think deserves them, the
TUG’S TAG choices that I will make in each
of the categories will be my predictions of the
choices I think the academy will make.

First, the minor awards.

Best Costume Design

The nominees are: Coming to America,
Dangerous Liaisons, A Handful of Dust,
Sunset and Tucker: The Man and His
Dream,

I don’t see how the academy can give it to
any film but Dangerous Liaisons. The film’s
eighteenth century costumes were breathtaking
in both their apparent authenticity and in their
fine detail. This one shouldn’t be tough to
pick.

Tug’s Tag: Dangerous Liaisons

Best Visual Effects
The nominees are: Die Hard, Who Framed
Roger Rabbit? and Willow.

I said it in September and I still believe it
If Roger Rabbit doesn’t win this award there
is no justice in the world. Robert Zemeckis
and the rest of the crew who put animation
and live action together so effectively deserve
every visual award they are up for.
Tug’s Tag: Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

Best Cinematography

The nominees are: Peter Biziou, Mississippi
Burning, Dean Cundey, Who Framed Roger
Rabbit?, Conrad L. Hall, Tequila Sunrise,
Sven Nykvist, The Unbearable Lightness of
Being and John Searle, Rain Man.

This one is a tough call. The man I
wanted to give’.the Oscar to was the
cinematographer who shot Tucker. In my
mind that was the finest cinematic
achievement of the year but he wasn’t
nominated. Still, the five nominated are all
excellent. Searle and Cundey have the inside
track but Biziou and even Nykvist have
outside shots.

Tug’s Tag: John Searle, Rain Man.

Best Foreign Language Film
The nominees are: Hanussen (Hungary), The
Music Teacher (Belgium), Pelle the
Conquerer (Denmark), Salaam Bombay!
(India) and Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown, (Spain).

Since I don’t have a chance to see foreign
films very often I usually pick the film that
has gotten the most positive response from the

critics, but last year I got burned. This year,
Max von Sydow’s Best Actor nomination will
help the plight of Pelle, but I’m going to go
with a gut feeling.

Tug’s Tag: Women on the Verge, (Spain)

Best Original Screenplay

The nominees are: Ronald Bass and Barry
Morrow, Rain Man, John Cleese and Charles
Crichton, A Fish Called Wanda, Naomi
Foner, Running on Empty, Gary Ross and
Anne Spielberg, Big and Ron Shelton, Bull
Durham.

This is another tough category to call. All
of the screenplays were excellent but in the
end I think Rain Man’s popularity and
acceptance in the film circles will be too
much for the other nominees. Any way you
cut it, it will be close.

Tug’s Tag: Ross and Morrow, Rain Man

Best Adapted Screenplay

The nominees are: Jean-Claude Carriere and
Philip Kaufman, The Unbearable Lightness
of Being, Christine Edzard, Little Dorrit,
Frank Galati and Lawrence Kasdan, The
Accidental Tourist, Christopher Hampton,
Dangerous Liaisons and Hamilton Phelan and
Tab Murphy, Gorillas in the Mist.

In my mind, Christopher Hampton deserves
this award far and away. I have never read
Hampton’s original play ‘‘Les Liaisons
Dangereuses’’ from which Dangerous
Liaisons is taken, but assuming it is
somewhat close to the screenplay, it is nothing
short of brilliant writing.

Tug’s Tag: Christopher Hampton, Dangerous
Liaisons

And now for the major awards,
Best Director
The nominees are: Charles Crichton, A Fish
Called Wanda, Barry Levinson, Rain Man,
Mike Nichols, Working Girl, Alan Parker,
Mississippi Burning and Martin Scorsese,
The Last Temptations of Christ.

Crichton and Nichols did wonderful jobs
with their films, but it is not very often that a
director can pull this award without having a
Best Picture contender which neither man has.
I think Scorsese’s nomination is just the
academy’s way of saying they support him for
making such a controversial film. That leaves
Parker and Levinson and in all senses, Barry
Levinson’s direction and film are clearly that
much better than Parker’s. Since the Oscars
began in 1927 the Best Director award and
the Best Picture award have coincided 45 of
60 times and 16 of 18 times since 1970. This
year will be no different.

Tug’s Tag: Barry Levinson, Rain Man

Best Supporting Actress

The nominees are: Joan Cusack, Working
Girl, Geena Davis, The Accidental Tourist,
Frances McDormand, Mississippi Burning,
Michelle Pfeiffer, Dangerous Liaisons and
Sigourney Weaver, Working Girl.

This category poses an interesting question
for the academy. For only the sixth time in its
history, the academy gave a _ double
nomination this year to Sigoumey Weaver. In
the Best Actress category she is probably a
clear fourth. Do you give her the Oscar to
make up for the actress award. No, you don’t.
The Academy on the other hand might. My
vote goes to Geena Davis who gave what I
thought was the best female supporting
performance nominated. Had Susan Sarandon
been nominated for Bull Durham I think she
might have gotten my vote, but of the women
nominated Davis is the best. If she doesn’t get
it, I think Michelle Pfeiffer will. It’s a tough
call.

Tug’s Tag: Geena Davis, The Accidental

Tourist

Best Supporting Actor
The nominees are: Alec Guiness, Little
Dorrit, Kevin Kline, A Fish Called Wanda,
Martin Landau, Tucker: The Man and His
Dream, River Phoenix, Running on Empty
and Dean Stockwell, Married to the Mob.
This category is hard for me to call
because I haven’t seen two of the films.
Unfortunately, they are the two most in
contention. River Phoenix has gotten rave
reviews about his part in Running on Empty
and recently won the National Board of
Review Best Supporting Actor award. On the
other hand, Stockwell won awards from the
New York Film Critics Circle and from The
National Society of Film Critics while Guiness
won the award from the Los Angeles Film
Critics Association. This category seems to be
wide open. I like Martin Landau and thought
his portrayal of Jeff Bridges uncle/partner in
Tucker was wonderful. This one is too close
to call.

Best Actress
+The nominees are: Glenn Close, Dangerous
Liaisons, Jodie Foster, The Accused, Melanie
Griffith, Working Girl, Meryl Streep, A Cry
in the Dark and Sigourney Weaver, Gorillas
in the Mist.

This category should be sticky but it won't
be. In my mind the best female performance
of the year came from Jodie Foster. Her
portrayal of the rape victim in The Accused
was both touching and believable; a
combination not easy to achieve. Unfortunately
she won’t win the award this year.

Many times, as in the cases of Henry
Fonda in 1981, Geraldine Page in 1986 and
Paul Newman in 1987, the academy seems to
award obligatory Oscars to actors who have
received numerous nominations over the years
but who have never won. This year, Glenn
Close gave a fantastic performance in
Dangerous Liaisons and whether it was the
best of the year or not, she will win the
award because it’s her fifth try, she’s never
won and she’s so close.

Tug’s Tag: Glenn Close, Dangerous Liaisons

Best Actor

The nominees are: Gene Hackman,
Mississippi Burning, Tom Hanks, Big, Dustin
Hoffman, Rain Man, Edward James Olmos,
Stand and Deliver and Max von Sydow,
Pelle the Conquerer.

Like the Best Actress category it is a
shame that all five men can’t win because
they all gave excellent performances. Unlike
the Best Actor category, however, there was
not an actress who stood head and shoulders
above the rest like Dustin Hoffman did in the
Best Actor category. There is absolutely no
way the academy can justify not giving
Hoffman the award. I’m very glad the
academy gave Max von Sydow a nomination
after so many years of wonderful work with
Ingmar Bergman, but they cannot give him
the award as a career twilight highlight. As
Raymond Babbit in Rain Man, Hoffman gave
what I think time will consider one of the
finest performances of the decade. Hackman,
Hanks, von Sydow and Olmns all gave
excellent performances but there is no
question here.

Tug’s Tag: Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man

Best Picture

The nominees are: ‘The Accidental Tourist,
Dangerous Liaisons; , Mississippi Burning,
Rain Man and Working Girl.

As stated earlier, not since 1984 has the
decision for best picture been this difficult to
make. I eliminate Working Girl right off the
bat because as I said in my review of it, the
film is just a remake of The Secret of my
Success with a bigger, role-reversed cast. I
was also fairly unimpressed and somewhat
bored with Mississippi Burning and don’t
really think it can be considered.

That leaves Tourist, Rain Man and
Liaisons. To be perfectly honest I thought
each of these films was incredibly well done
and a thrill to watch. Each has its forte;
Tourist the feel, Rain Man _ Hoffman’s
performance and Liaisons the _ brilliant
screenplay from Hampton. Yet, each of these
films has more than just its individual forte
and that’s why they are 1988’s finest three
films.

As far deciding the best film, Liaisons is
brilliant but still comes off as a play in
cinematic form and because of that is slightly
tainted. Rain Man is brilliant as well but
possibly relies too much on the mastery of
Hoffman’s performance. I’m afraid if you take
part of the intensity’ away from _ the
performance the film loses some of its bite.
The Accidental Tourist as I said two weeks
ago would be my choice for Best Picture. In
choosing a Best Picture, I think one must look
at how all the elements work together.
Tourist puts them all together in a perfectly
balance package. The acting, the
cinematography, the story and the screenplay
are all consistent and never dominate each
other making for a very smooth and coherent
film. Regardless of my wishes however, I
think Hoffman’s performance will be enough
to give Rain Man the award.
