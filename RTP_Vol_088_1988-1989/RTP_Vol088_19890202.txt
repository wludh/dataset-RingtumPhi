Underclasswomen are seen here last Thursday on Bid night.

Nearly 260 women
say ‘yes’ to Greek

 

By Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

Two-hundred and fifty-nine Wash-
ington & Lee women pledged
sororities in the University Center last
Thursday after attending a five-day
rush.

Rush interviews, acquaintance par-
ties and bid night took place in three
rooms decorated with balloons and
other paraphernalia. Alumnae of Chi
Omega, Kappa Alpha Theta and Kap-
pa Kappa Gamma ran the rush, as
national members do when sororities
are first colonized on a campus.

Commonly referred to as sororities,
these Greek groups are actually called
women’s fraternities because the term
sorority did not exist when they were
founded.

Lissa Bradford, National
Panhellenic Area Advisor, was ex-
cited at how well the affair turned out.

“The reaction of the girls was
rewarding,’’ she said. ‘‘Everybody
seemed pleased about what they
pledged and I hope the three outstan-
ding groups can maintain those at-
titudes.”’

After two nights of mingling among
the sororities, the rushees filled out
**preference cards,’’ marking their
Ist, 2nd, and 3rd choices. Unlike
fraternity rush, women only get one
bid to an organization so no choosing
is involved after the preference card
has been turned in. The ‘three
sororities took the maximum amount
of women.

Julie Cline, a member of the Sorori-
ty Advisory Committee, felt the pro-
cess ran very smoothly.

‘*We were mainly concerned about
scheduling problems,’’ she said. ‘“But

Washington and Lee University has
been noted in the February issue of
Southern Magazine as being one of the
top 28 liberal arts colleges in the
South.

The article provides information for
high school students about the best
qualities to look for in a college. The
colleges listed in the magazine were
selected from Peterson's Competitive
Colleges, Barron's Guide to the Most
Prestigious Colleges, and Lovejoy’s
College Guide. The writer of the arti-
cle, Catherine O’Shea, described the
colleges as ‘‘attracting the cream of

be turning to W&L as an example of
Greeks and administrators working
together.”’

In response to the article, Tim
a W&L admissions
counselor, said the biggest reason the

» university attracts so many students is

because ‘‘W&L combines the per-
sonal attention of the smaller liberal
arts colleges with the broad academic

opportunities of larger universities.”’

thanks to Lissa Bradford, girls who
wanted to rush but had conflicts, such
as play practice, concerts, or sports,
were accommodated. ”’

According to Leroy C. ‘‘Buddy’’
Atkins, associate dean of students,
rush was consolidated to a five day
period instead of a more typical pro-
cess of several weeks because the
national representatives came from
out of town.

“‘T have had all positive feedback,
especially from the national women
who ran the program,’’ he said.
“‘They were very complimentary of

‘the W&L women for their enthusiasm
and ability to grasp the whole pro-
cons.’

Atkins added that rush will take
place next January as well, although a
bit earlier, because of organizational
reasons.

Each sorority has a chapter consul-
tant to insure the success of the col-
ony. These women, Penny Pierce of
Chi O, Lynda Fairman of Theta and
Lorrie Favret of Kappa will remain at
W&L until the end of the year. The
national fraternities will send in
replacements for next year.

Installation of the colonies will take
place some time in May. In the mean-
time, a college Panhellenic (com-
parable to the Interfraternity Council)
will be organized, along with service
and community projects and socials.

According to Fairman the various
projects will be a way to unite the
women both in and out of their
perspective groups.

‘The unity of the women within
their fraternity and through the
Panhellenic is exciting,’’ she said.
“‘The combination of these is what’s
going to make the whole women’s
Greek system stronger.”’

Bands to include the Connells, 6 others

 

From Staff Reports

 

Washington and Lee University is
hosting its 11th Annual Superdance to
benefit the Muscular Dystrophy
Association. The dance will be held
Friday and Saturday, Feb. 3 and 4, in
the Student Activities Pavilion from 6
p.m. to 1 a.m. each night. Live Drive
will be available starting at 5:30 to
transport dancers to the Pavilion.

Friday night will begin with a Battle
of the Bands competition between
campus bands. The bands _par-
ticipating are C.H.O. (Kappa Sigma),
Green Eggs & Ham (Phi Delta Theta),
Lost in the Supermarket (Kappa
Alpha), and We Have No Name (Phi
Kappa Sigma). These bands will be
followed by Widespread Panic, a band
out of Athens, Georgia. Wildgrass
and the winner of the Battle of the
Bands will open for Indecision and
The Connells on Saturday night.

‘*The quality of the bands that we
have for this year’s Superdance was
made possible not only through

pledges, but also through a substantial
donation from the Student Activities
Board for which we are very
grateful,’’ said Wright Ledbetter,
chairman of the event.

Pie throws will also be held Satur-
day night at around 11 p.m. The three
chosen faculty members for this event
are Coach Buck Leslie, W&L golf
team; Coach Page Remillard, W&L
swim team; and Professor Joel Snow,
Military Science.

Debi Hurtt, co-chairman of the
event, expects that there will be 150
dancers this year compared to 110 last
year. Each dancer solicits pledges for
MDA. A prize will be given for the
largest amount of cash and pledges
and also for the largest amount of cash
raised. Prizes are also awarded to the
fraternity and the organization do-
nating the most money.

The prizes include weekends for
two at the Dupont Plaza in
Georgetown, the Greenbriar, the
Williamsburg Hilton, and The Hotel
Roanoke. A complete package to Fan-

cy Dress and gift certificates from
many local merchants will also be
awarded.

A weekend admission package is
available for $10. Admission for only
Friday night is $4 per person and ad-
mission for Saturday night is $8 per
person. All of the money raised
through dancers and spectators is do-
nated ‘to the Roanoke chapter of
MDA. ‘‘We expect to receive the bulk
of money from the fraternities because
they are the largest student force on
campus, and now with the introduc-
tion of sororities at W&L we hope to
have an equally substantial contribu-
tion from the women,’’ said
Ledbetter.

Superdance has also had other
events throughout the year including
two Super-Bowl bowling nights at
Fast Lane, a Casino Night in the
GHQ, and a meal give up in the Din-
ing Hall. These events plus the dance
will help the Committee to reach its
goal of a $25,000 donation to
Muscular Dystrophy.

Trustees approve 2% tuition raise

New faculty needed to remain competitive with other schools

 

By Elizabeth Parkins
Tri-Editor

 

All full-time undergraduate and law
students can expect to pay 2 percent
more next year on their tuition bill,
President Wilson says.

In a letter to all students and
parents, which will be sent out in the
next few days, Wilson explains that
tuition will rise next year to $10,100
for undergraduates and $10,300 for
law students.

“Frankly, I recommended a major
increase in tuition in 1989-90 to per-
mit the University to add a series of
key faculty positions and to bring fa-
culty compensation and academic
program support to a level commen-
surate with the University’s peer in-
Stitutions,’’ Wilson writes.

New faculty positions would be
added in Japanese and Russian lan-
guage and literature, politics,
American history, Spanish, art
history, and in the law school. The
new staff would ‘‘secure new areas of

competence and keep class and section
size from growing,’’ writes Wilson. |

Wilson wanted a major increase in
order to finance these changes. At the

same time however, he and the Board

justment could cause problems for
some students.

possible level. We have been proud of
this record and will continue to resist

behind other institutions. In order for
W&L to remain competitive with
other colleges the salary gap must be
closed Wilson said.

“The fact of the matter is that
without quite realizing it, we have
been asking our faculty to subsidize
our low tuition. By this I mean to

point out that in the current year our
tuition is between three and four thou-
sand dollars lower than the tuition of
Amherst, Bowdoin, Bucknell,

Carleton, Oberlin, Duke, Pomona,
Swarthmore and Wesleyan,”’ writes
Wilson.

Currently, a large portion of the
University’s operating budget is
covered by tuition. The rest is covered
by endowment returns and by gifts

from alumni, parents, foundations and
friends. Next year however, tuition

must cover an increased portion of the
budget.

“It carries a clear message that we
must, in the near future, add substan-
tially to the permanent endowment
and the gift income of Washington and
Lee. Only in this way can we maintain

a reasonable balance between tuition
and all other sources of the funds re-
quired to provide superior educational
opportunities for the young people
who matriculate here,’’ concludes
Wilson.

SAB faces obstacles
in scheduling bands

 

By Pat Lopes
Staff Reporter

 

With the Phi Kap, KA, SAE and Phi
Delt house bands battling it out
followed by Indecision on Friday
night, and Wild Grass, the triumphant
battle band and Indecision warming up
the crowd for the Connells on Satur-
day night, Superdance has an im-
pressive line up that’s bound to attract
crowds.

Unfortunately, recent SAB concerts
have failed to fill the pavilion. When
people talk on Monday morning about

dismal turnout on a weekend night,

inevitably the conversation turns to

the SAB’s choice of bands. A lot of
people wonder why the SAB is unable

to get better known bands for
Homecoming, Christmas Weekend
and other big weekends.

W&L limitations form the obstacle.

Overcoming obstacles to get the best
band possible is the job of SAB Enter-
tainment Director Judy Payne. Payne
books groups for SAB events in-
cluding Wednesday night bands at the
GHQ.

Budget is an obvious challenge for

Payne. Although it seems that students
pay a substantial activities fee, $50 a
student spread over a year and a
number of student organizations is
obviously not going to cover the bill
for U2.

For good quality bands well known

in the East, money isn’t the problem,
according to Payne. ‘‘Money doesn’t
always talk in this business,”’
said.

she

A more severe challenge is the time

of year an event occurs. Bands nor-
mally tour during the fall and the spr-
ing, devoting the rest of the year to
bandkeeping tasks, such as recording,
regrouping, recovering and song
writing. So, booking Christmas con-
certs are difficult because of the
season.

Seasonal limitations aside, day of
the week inflexibility is another
challenge for Payne. She can’t offer
any date options to bands. Payne has
to match tour plans with specific
scheduled dates, which cuts down the
number of options open to the SAB.

Rescheduling concert dates is
difficult. Time is of the essence.
While SAB tries to conquer the W&L
bureaucracy, the band can be lost.

For example, *‘Little Feat’’ offered
to play on the Thursday instead of the
Friday before Christmas Weekend,
1988. The OK for a concert during the
school week was stalled. By time the
SAB got an all clear signal, the band
was booked

W&L’s location is another
challenge. Groups often can’t place
Lexington, Virginia on the map, ac-
cording to Payne. Once the bands
know where Lexington is, they then
have to be persuaded to deviate from
the beaten track between cities like
Charlottesville and Chapel Hill.

W&L students do have the oppor-
tunity to see and hear rising talent on
campus. ‘‘T try to pick the bands on
the up and up,”’ said Payne. REM and
the Violent Femmes played here three
years ago, when they were up and
coming. Payne continued, *‘Listening
to new groups, that’s what college
music is all about.””
OPINION

Defending a
Decision

 

Last week a letter to the editor appeared on the front page of the
Phi in which a student claimed to have been sexually harassed by

_,one of her professors.

The letter has since provoked a great deal of controversy on cam-
pus. That was one of our reasons for printing the letter, because we
“want members of the W&L community to be aware that sexual
. harassment is here (too many people carry the attitude that ‘‘Yeah,

it happens, but not here.’’).

We feel it necessary to further defend our decision to print the

‘letter.

As journalists, we have learned to investigate everything. Our

. journalistic ethics won't allow us ever to print something we
thought bogus. In this particular case, more sources were contacted
than were identified (and we'll leave it at that). The articles and

__ letter that appeared last week are not the result of poor journalism,
"but rather some poor interpretations by some members of the W&L

community.

We would also like to dispell some false rumors that have been
“circulating. NO, none of the journalism professors know who the
letter-writer or professor is. NO, we did not write the letter
ourselves. NO, the entire Phi staff does not know who the letter-
writer or professor is. NO, we did not select Marie Dunne to write
the sexual harassment article because she graduated in December
and would not have to deal with the repercussions (in fact, we wish

she could take some of them for us).

Our only regret is that some people are more concerned with fin-
ding out who the letter-writer and professor are than with the reality

of sexual harassment. We hope that will change.

To the Editors:

Thank you for publishing last week’s stories on
the subject of sexual harassment. It is dismaying
to learn that we have, apparently, not been spared
this unhappy feature of contemporary life in this
country. But it is just as well that we know as
much as we can about what is happening here and
to take every opportunity to apply the University’s
policies in a just and yet decisive way.

To the Editors:

I write with reference to the front page story in
the Ring-tum Phi last week. The headline **Sexual
harassment is a reality at W&L"’ is not supported
by the text of the article. Upon reading the story, I
discover that the only supporting evidence is an
anonymous letter from an anonymous student
stating that an unnamed professor had asked her to
sleep with him. Also three of her anonymous male
friends had been propositioned by unnamed
homosexual professors.

This story is an offense to every male professor
at W&L, because it places everyone of us under
suspicion. Even before the story was published,

Beware, all female students!$

To the Editors:

‘At first, I did not know how to react to your
recent editorial, ‘‘Recognizing Male Issues,”’ par-
ticularly its jolly little justification of the crime of
rape. I fear that I reacted initially with some
anger. It occurred to me that your readers might
be confused into believing that the criminal law

izes some special, minor misdemeanor en-
titled ‘‘date rape’’, when in fact rape is a serious
felony whether committed on a stranger or on a
date, whether perpetrated in a dorm room or in a
alley. Rape is rape and it is punishable in Virginia
by up to life in prison. My anger extended to the
writer of the editorial, who informs us that Mr.
Schenk has some very good points, but lacks the

Letters

We simply cannot tolerate the sexual abuse of
any member of this community, male or female,
faculty, staff or student. As I tried to say in my
Founders’ Day remarks, I hope all of us will
renew our efforts to keep clear and relevant the
overarching values of this University—and to find
ways to apply them in our everyday lives. I am
thinking especially of Lee’s powerful commit-
ment to the idea of human dignity and thus the

your editorial staff had leaked its contents.
Students, faculty, staff, and National Enquirer
readers are now curious as to the identity of the
lecherous professors. Students have asked me
‘‘who is it?’’ Other students have read through the
faculty register trying to guess who it is. In addi-
tion, people are wondering who wrote the letter,
and this is not fair to all upperclass female
students.

Washington and Lee has instituted procedures
by which students can report incidents of sexual
harassment whether by other students or by facul-
ty, If this anonymous letter writer was truly a vic-
tim, she should have used these procedures and

courage to state whether the writer shares’ Mr.
Schenk’s views or believes the reader should do
so. On reflection, I realized that I was reacting
like the Myopic Intolerant Fanatical Feminist Mr. -
Schenk would undoubtedly label me.

I thought again and realized that your recent
editorial is in fact an accurate and needed warning
for women students at Washington & Lee. If I
may be so bold as to restate the warning, it is this.

Beware, all women students!

There are men at Washington & Lee so arrogant
and self- centered that they believe they have the
right to treat you as a prostitute -- no, worse,as an
object with no feelings, will or moral values of
your own. Beware, there are men here who

   

Sexual harassment is affront to Honor Code

need to treat others in ways which always respect
and honor that dignity. It would be an inestimable
loss to Washington and Lee if we, in our time,
become content merely to pay lip-service to Lee’s
Code and lose utterly its content.

Sincerely,
John D. Wilson
President.

Anonymous letters cause unfair suspicions

the editors of the Phi should have referred the
letter to the Dean of Students Office.

Sexual harassment is an affront to all honorable
men and women, and faculty, staff, and students
who are guilty of such harassment need to be
disciplined and, in severe cases, should be remov-
ed from W&L. However appropriate action
cannot be taken through writing and publishing
anonymous letters, the main effect of which is to
cause many honorable professors to be under
suspicion.

Associate Professor of Administration

believe that the price of a hamburger and a movie
ticket buys them an irrevocable license to rape
you. Beware, there are men here who will
understand your embrace, not as a loving gesture
to be treasured, but as an invitation to rape. These
men are not worthy of your time, your trust or
your tenderness. .

Be careful out there!

In summary, I write to thank the editorial writer
for the great service of the warning our women
students at Washington & I ee.

Yours in Fanatical Feminism,
Joan M. Shaughnessy
Assistant Professor of Law

W & L P.E. requirements need restructuring

An Open Letter to the Washington and Lee Com-
munity:

Washington and Lee University prides itself on
the great amount of self-government that its
students are given. In light of this fact, it is impor-
tant that the University community be informed of
a proposed change in the physical education grad-
uation requirement.

As part of a campus-wide self-study, a five per-
son committee consisting of Athletic Department
personnel decided that the physical education re-
quirement, specifically in reference to inter-
collegiate athletes, should be changed. They felt
that a new policy could better reflect the diverse,
liberal arts focus of the University.

In order to ‘‘allow’’ a more diverse exposure to
the world of physical fitness and recreation, the
committee suggests that the maximum fraction of
a credit hour allowed for each varsity sport a stu-
dent participates in should be reduced from two-
fifths to one-fifth. This change would mean that
two, three, or even four years of varsity participa-
tion would garner the W&L student- athlete a
paltry 1/Sth credit, leaving four more P.E. classes
needed for graduation.

This move, at a school that has a long and rich
athletic tradition, as well as a 25% rate of inter-
collegiate athletic participation among its current
student body, would be a travesty. This proposed
policy change not only greatly limits the student-

athlete in his choice of when not to enroll in non-
varsity P.E. classes, it also fails to recognize the
diverse gains made from intercollegiate-level
training and competition.

The student-athlete at W&L is the student who
is internally motivated to participate in athletics.
He or she is the person who will be involved in
physical activity for the rest of their life. These
young adults have established, through years of
dedication and self-motivation, the desire to stay
physically fit, and to participate in a wide spec-
trum of invigorating activities.

These student-athletes, who spend many hours
each week involved in a variety of physical ac-
tivities, do not need to be ‘‘allowed’’ to explore
the variety of the school’s offerings. The liberal
arts emphasis of W&L is embodied in the student-
athlete. The Athletic Department’s goal of a stu-
dent body that is well-versed in motor skills and
fitness, rules and strategy, and good sportsman-
ship, has already been ingrained in the student-
athlete.

We, the undersigned student-athletes, as well as
other members of the W&L community, support
an alternative solution that would serve not only
the student-athlete, but also benefit the general
student, and the Athletic Department itself:

1) Allow 1/5th a credit for the first season of
each varsity sport in which the student-athlete par-
ticipates. (Each student would still need to accu-
mulate 5/Sths cr. hr.)

2) For each subsequent season, in each sport,
give the student-athlete one credit hour of graded
participation, up to a total of nine credits. (8 cr.
hrs. + 5/Scr. hr. = 9 cr. hrs.)

The W&L student participates in intercollegiate
athletics for many reasons, primarily because they
want to. The beneficial growing experiences that
the student-athlete receives adds a whole new
dimension to his or her education. The positive
exposure the University receives through their
success is as valuable to W&L as the research,
writing, and performances done in other areas.

If the University feels so strongly that physical
education is important to a liberal arts education
that it makes frequent participation a requirement,
then the University should accord the Department
of Athletics equal status with the rest of the cam-
pus.

It is time that the student-athlete, as well as the
Athletic Department’s physical education offer-
ings, be given the credits they deserve. The Uni-
versity should assemble a group, comprised of
students, student-athletes, and faculty members,
to discuss this proposal. More importantly the
administration should pay attention to what the
students, and the University community, feel is
best for the future of Washington & Lee!

Sincerely,
Stu Sheldon 89

Statistics deemed “‘irresponsible journalism”’

To the editors:

A bit of easy but irresponsible journalism
popped up in our paper on Jan. 19, 1989, when it
highlighted some significant statistics gleaned
from the Registrar’s Report: Chinese gave the
most A +’s (28.1 percent), while Russian the most
F's (10 percent).

Statistics!

But everyone knows that percentages churned
out with no regard to sample size are less than ir-
relevant—they re downright misleading. One stu-
dent in a class of ten who forgets to fill out his
drop slip will hopelessly skew the score. In the
same breath, the reporter might have seized upon
the whopping (!) 65 percent of students who got
A’s and B’s in that class.

Of the hundreds of statistics displayed in the
Report, here’s one: ‘‘Out of 2,015 history
students, less than one percent (.007) received a
failing grade.’’ Now that would be a statistically
significant statistic (which would at the same time
increase our History enrollments...).

Students thank King Celebration supporters

To the Editors:

On behalf of the Minority Student Association,
I would like to express my sincere thanks to every
area resident, staff person, student, faculty
member, and administrator for joining us at the
First Baptist Church on Monday, January 16 for a
celebration of the life of Martin Luther King, Jr.

I would also like to thank those of you who sup-
ported us in our endeavor to publicize the pro-

gram and involve the W&L community.

The wise and encouraging words from, our
speaker, Ms. Louise Coleman, will surely remain
embedded in our hearts and minds for many
years.

It is the fervent desire of the Minority Student
Association that a celebration of Dr. King’s life
and achievements such as this one will become a
traditional and annual event in which people of all
races, backgrounds, and religious beliefs will

freely partake.

Sincerely,

Military novelists
will visit VMI

From Staff Reports

 

Novels of war and of the tech-
nological complexities of modern
military machinery have been smash
hits on the best-seller lists of the
1980’s, and next week, Virginia
Military Institute will have a hit of its
own when it is hosts to four of the
most popular current writers of novels
about modern-day warfare and the
people who fight those military fan-
tasies.

Novelists Tom Clancy, Stephen
Coonts, Harold Coyle and W.E.B.
Griffin will visit VMI together over
the Feb. 8-10 period, and on Thursday
evening, Feb. 9, they will appear in a
panel discussion in Jackson Memorial
Hall. The 8 p.m. program on ‘‘The
Fiction of War** is open to the public
and will include a question and answer
period with the audience.

The four authors will be available
Friday, Feb. 10, to autograph copies
of their books at a book-signing recep-
tion to be held in Lejeune Hall from
1:30 to 3:30 p.m. It is also open to the
public.

Clancy, author of The Hunt for Red
October (1984), Red Storm Rising
(1986), Patriot Games (1987), and
The Cardinal of the Kremlin (1988),
all best sellers, is the owner of a
Maryland insurance agency and a self-
described technology freak. His
books, which have sold by the
millions, are military thrillers full of
high-tech gadgetry of modern
weapons systems and the alarming
plots of future world wars.

Coonts, a 1968 graduate of West

Virginia University, where he also
received a Navy commission, is the
author of Flight of Intruder (1986) and
Final Flight (1988). After earning his
Navy wings, he flew A-6 bombers in
southeast Asia from 1971 to 1973. By
the end of his tour he had accumulated
1600 hours in the Intruder and logged
305 arrested carrier landings, more
than 100 of them at night. Holder of
the Distinguished Flying Cross, he is
today an attorney in Denver, Colo.,
and a commander in the Naval Air Re-
serve.

Coyle, a 1974 graduate of VMI and
a U.S. Army major stationed with the
First Cavalry Division at Fort Hood,
Texas, is the author of Team Yankee
(1987) and Sword Point (1988). An
armor officer since his graduation
from VMI, Coyle knows about
soldiering and tanks. He is currently
the operations officer with a tank-
heavy, combined arms task force.

Griffin, a pseudonym used by
writer William E. Butterworth Il of
Fairhope, Ala., is the author of the
seven novels in the Brotherhood of
War series (1983-86) and of several
books in the series on the Marine
Corps called The Corps (1985-87), in-
cluding Semper Fi and Call to Arms.
An Army veteran of Korean War ser-
vice and a former combat correspon-
dent, he is a career writer whose ex-
tensive publications also include
several dozen children’s books. A
best-seller author since 1968, he is a
member of the Alabama Academy of
Distinguished Authors.

While at VMI, the four popular
novelists will also address cadets dur-
ing English department class periods.

Solar-powered car

By Brian Root
Staff Reporter

 

The solar-powered car that won a
1950-mile race across Australia in
1987 is capable of speeds of up to 70
miles an hour, said one of the car’s
designers last week in a speech at the
Virginia Military Institute.

The car, which was built by a sub-
sidiary of General Motors, requires
only about .7 kilowatts to operate the
electric engine; said Dr. Floyd Wyc-
zalek to an audience of about 60 peo-

ple on Jan. 26. A normal, gasoline-
fueled car needs about 12 kilowatts of
power.

“*You must realize the enormous
amount of power we have, consider-
ing the small amount of energy we had
to work with,’’ said Wyczalek.

The car, called the Sunraycer, won
the World Solar Challenge in October
of 1987. The Challenge is a race
across the entire continent of Australia
which is open only to. solar-powered
cars.

The Sunraycer averaged about 66

Plan for careers |
in New York City

Career office arranges program
to meet alumni contacts

 

By Heidi Read
Tri-Editor

 

The Career Development and
Placement Office has arranged a
“‘pilot’’ program for seniors to meet
alumni contacts in New York City
over Washington Holiday.

The first of its kind, the program
called Career Connections: New York
is designed to hook up seniors with
alumni in New York who are prospec-
tive employers or who can direct
seniors to the right people in their job
search, said Dean N. Rick Heatley,
director of the Career Development
and Placement Office.

Starting with a reception on Mon-
day, Feb. 13, alumni will be available
to socialize, share information and
discuss career opportunities in a varie-
ty of fields. Some of the career fields
that are being represented are finan-
cial services (all banking opportunities
and insurance), public relations,
advertising and marketing, broad-
casting, journalism and publishing,
non-profit and public sector, interna-
tional business, sales, arts manage-
ment and museums, paralegal, ac-
counting, real estate and others.

Seniors may submit resumes before
break to participating alumni or set up

travels by the speed of light

kilometers an hour (about 43 m.p.h)
in the six days of the race. It defeated
the second-place car, built by Ford,
by several days and the last-place car,
built by Mitsubishi, by an entire mon-
th.

Of the 24 cars that entered the race,
only 13 finished.

In order to reach such high speeds,
said Wyczalek, the car had to be very

ortight anshaerodynamic. The car, with

dviver, weighed only 511 pounds.

“‘The'whole car can be easily pick-
ed up by two people,’’ Wyczalek said.

Concerts aren’t just for tourists

By Lori Richardson
Staff Reporter

 

During the tourist off-season,
January through March, the Lex-
ington Visitor Center is featuring local
singers and musical groups in weekly
concerts to attract local people to the
new center and entertain tourists.

Every Wednesday afternoon at the
new East Washington Street location,
where the Centel office was located,
tourists and local citizens can hear a
flute ensemble, chamber singers or a
handbell choir, said Betty Jo Lee, who
works at the new Visitor Center.

According to Jean Tardy Clark, the
tour coordinator at the center, ‘Local

people are the last to see the local
sites. They will travel miles and miles
to see sites, but not the ones in their
own backyard. The concerts en-
courage the local people to see the
new center and see the differences
with the old one. Some people have
probably never been to either center.”’

“Last week 35 people came to
listen. Yesterday there were about 25
people and only two were visitors to
Lexington. The rest were local,”’ said
Lee.

Clark said the ‘‘nice’’ attendance
has probably been aided by the beau-
tiful weather. The center sent out an-
nouncements to Rockbridge residents
to tell them about the concert series.
Word of mouth and ads in the local

paper brought some people in, too,
she said.

Lee said the performers are from
the Rockbridge area and some
students participate in the local
groups.

According to Lee, ‘‘Local people
who work don’t have to give up their
whole lunch hour and visitors won’t

have to lose a whole hour if they want”

to attend one of our concerts.’ The
two January concerts each lasted
about 20 minutes.

Next week, the ‘‘Chocolate F Con-
sort’ will perform recorder and lute
music of the Renaissance and Baroque
periods. A schedule is available at the

~ new Visitor Center.

What worried the designers the
most, said Wyczalek, was that a stong
crosswind could easily flip the car
over, which happened to several of the
entrants. A large truck could pass the
Sunraycer and overturn it, but it never
happened.

**We were certainly very lucky,”’
said Wyczalek. ‘‘Our biggest problem
was three flat tires, which was far
fewer than we expected to:get in a
week.”’ :

The project, which was staffed only
by volunteers, spent eight months

preparing the car and the plan for the
race.

“This system was planned just like
you'd plan a NASA launch,’’ said
Wyczalek.

In addition to the Sunraycer, the en-
tourage included a communications
truck, a telemetry van, which moni-
tored the car’s performance, a
replacement car, and satellite com-
munications equipment.

Although the car averaged about 43
m.p.h. during the race, Wyczalek
said, the car did reach about 70 m.p.h.

interview times at the reception. But
Heatley said to plan on remaining 19
New York for a few days to follow up
on any leads that resulted from the re-
ception. He said a binder will be
available in the Career Development
Office that posts the position descrip-
tions supplied by participating alumni
so that seniors can get background in-
formation on companies.

The alumni connection has proved
to be a ‘‘wonderful network for
aiding seniors in their job search,
Heatley said.

Heatley said he hopes to organize
other Career Connections programs in
other major cities if it proves to be a
valuable recruiting outlet. ‘‘It’s a way
to hook up with alumni in major cities
and get your foot in the door. The
possibilities are endless,”’ he said.

He predicts a good response from
both alumni and students, but stressed
the importance of stating target areas,
or job descriptions and objectives.

However, since plans need to be
finalized, Heatley said that seniors,
and juniors interested in internships,

need to make reservations soon. ‘‘If
you want to tap into it (the alumni
connections) you need to hook up
now, otherwise we'll have trouble
making an alumni match,”’ he said.

while qualifying for the event.

Unfortunately, said Wyczalek,
solar-powered cars are not yet feasible
for mass-production.

“The truth is, they’re just too ex-
pensive to build,’’ said Wyc:
zalek.‘*The materials are too rare and
expensive.”

Wyczalek said that the Sunraycer
may be brought to Lexington for pub-
lic view in April or May, although it is
not yet definite.

 

 

Missert wins ROTC award

 

From Staff Reports

 

A 1988 W&L graduate was
awarded the Army Achievement
Medal Tuesday in a ceremony at
the Military Science Department.

Lieutenant Jon Missert earned
the award while serving as the
department’s Gold Bar Recruiter
since his graduation last June.
Missert was able to spent his first
six months after graduation here
under a program that allows
graduates to serve as ROTC

recruiters at their alma maters.

Missert was cited in the award
for his meritorious service and his
“‘outstanding initiative in develop-
ing programs to inform the student
body about the ROTC program,’’
said Joel Snow, professor of
military science.

During his six months he has
worked in all areas of recruiting,
especially with incoming
freshmen. Through mailing cam-
paigns and personal visits to high
schools Lt. Missert has ‘‘single-
handedly increased the awareness

of Army ROTC on campu: and put ,
together a high school recruiting
program,’’ said Capt. Ramon
Ramos, Missert’s supervisor.

According to Missert, the Gold
Bar experience has ‘‘been an ex-
cellent transition from college to
life as a professional officer.’’ He
will be attending the Field Artillery
Officer Basic Course at Fort Sill,
OK. from February to July. He
will then be stationed at Fort
Bragg, N.C., in an airborne ar-
tillery unit.

(continued from page 2)

The history of anti-semitism is a
long and complex one. The Jews have
been persecuted as money-grubbing
Christ-killers for centuries. As re-
vered a figure as the Protestant
reformer, Martin Luther, hated them
and recommended their synagogues
be burned. Programs and govern-
ment-encouraged massacres of Jews
were almost commonplace in Eastern
Europe and especially Russia into the
20th century. With the advent of
super-nationalist sentiment in the late
19th century organized anti-Semitic
movements sprouted up like
mushrooms. In supposedly enlighten-
ed 1890’s France, an officer named
Dreyfus was falsely accused of es-
pionage owing to his Judaism, an
event which became a world cause
celebre. Jews were universally denied
social privileges which were accorded
ordinary Gentiles in Western Europe,
and were outright persecuted in Cen-
tral and Eastern Europe up to the 20th
century. Even in liberal Britain, the
brilliant prime minister, Benjamin
Disraeli (originally D’Israli), could
have embarked on no political career
had he not been baptized beforehand.

Still, some of the most ardent anti-
semitic agitation took place between,
roughly, 1870 and 1914 in Germany
and (ethnically German) Austria-
Hungary. Philosophical and political
movements such as Georg von
Schonerer’s Pan-Germans and
Richard Wagner Circle harped on the
Jewish menace to German ethnic soli-
darity and survival, and many rec-
ommended their destruction. The
reasons for why an intellectual move-
ment developed in opposition to the
Jewish race are manifold, but to a
great degree these Volkish (ultra-
German) thinkers resented what they

PEE CeEECU LUELLA LLL

perceived as Jewish-inspired  in-

dustrialism, which threatened the

German aesthetic spirit. Also, in an

extremely nationalist age, the Jews

seemed rootless, nationless, and even
conspiratorial, and thus hateful.
Regardless, anti-Semitism was so in
vogue by the turn of the century that
the Viennese mayor, Karl Lueger, es-
poused it in order to enhance his own
popularity. Hitler assembled the ideas
of a myriad of these German (and
some non-German) _ intellectuals,
stirred in his own experiences, and
came up with his ‘‘final solution of the

Jewish problem.”’

Once war and then the Holocaust
became reality, Hitler turned to his
Satellite nations for aid in the
“‘cleansing’’ of Jew-infested Europe.
This is a very convoluted issue
because, although most governments
co-operated, motivations are difficult
to assess. After all, did Italy,
Hungary, Bulgaria, et.al. turn over
Jews to the Nazis out of anti-Semitism
or just plain fear of Hitler’s wrath?
Still, upon receipt of groups of Jewish
deportees from Germany, the satellite
government of Vichy France promptly
sent them back to the Reich. Evident-
ly, Vichy regarded the threat of Nazi
punishment as preferable to accepting
more Jews onto French soil.

As time passes, the memory of the
events of the Holocaust is unlikely to
pass from the long-term memory of
mankind. Yet its meaning can and, to
some extent, has. It probably makes
us feel better to pin the blame on
Hitler, who is difficult to understand
and easy to hate. Some guilt-ridden
liberal apologists have alternately
gotten into the habit of blaming the
West, and chiefly the United States,
for not doing something to help the
Jews, a premise which is difficult to
put much stock in. Establishing blame
in an event as devastating as the
Holocaust does not change its grim
outcome. We can merely attempt to
understand its antecedents so as to
avert the next one.

classic sit-com, allow me to bring you
up to date. The Brady Bunch is about a
man (Mr. Brady), three sons (Greg,
Peter and Bobby) and a housekeeper
(Alice) who re-marries a woman
(Mrs. Brady) with three daughters
(Marcia, Jan and Cindy) . This motley
group lives together in a suburban
home with artificial grass. Note: Do
not confuse the Brady Bunch with the
Partridge Family. The Partridge Fam-
ily are dope-smoking musicians who
drive around in a tie-dye bus singing
songs about life. While Brady Bunch
episodes over the years have generally
informed viewers about the nature of
the Brady psyche, there are still some
unanswered questions. Actually, there
are exactly three unanswered ques-
tions:

1.) Does Alice (the housekeeper)
favor the Brady boys over the Brady
girls since she lived with them longer?

2.) Did rising levels of male hor-
mones in the puberty- driven bodies of
Greg and Peter compound with the
short sexy mini-skirts worn by Marcia
and Jan result in any type of sexual re-
lationship between these unrelated
siblings?

3.) And finally, where did the
Brady’s purchase all of their funky
garb?

Unfortunately, there are no black
and white answers to these crucial
Brady questions. Normally, I would
satisfy curious readers by making up
my own answers like ‘‘The family
buys all of their clothes at the
Polyester Thrift Shop’’, but due to
space limitations | am compelled to

 

move on to yet another fascinating
Brady Bunch topic: The 1988 Brady
Bunch Christmas Reunion special was
shown in December.

First the plot summary: the Brady
kids, now grown up and wearing
modern clothes and living in obscure
parts of the world, come back to the
house with artificial grass where they
grew up to spend Christmas with
Mom, Dad and Alice. While the kids
have been gone for the last 15 years,
Dad has kept his job as an architect
and Alice and Mom kept busy getting
rid of the shag carpet and the velvet
bed spreads.

Now the editorial comment: The
most consistent character was Greg
(the oldest son). The grown up Greg
was as nerdy as the young Greg. Gen-
erally, everyone turned out to be
much uglier and not nearly as likeable
as adults. Except for Cindy who look-
ed more like a Playboy centerfold than
a Brady. True Brady Bunch fans like
my brother-in-law, Herb, could tell
right away that Cindy was a fake
(pseudoCindy) planted there by the
producers to get the better ratings.
The highlight of the Christmas dinner
was when Bobby (the youngest son)
stood up and announced that he
dropped out of graduate school and
was now a race car driver.

Finally the climax: Dad had to leave
in the middle of dinner because
workers at a building he designed
were at work (on Christmas day)
when the building collapsed. Dad,
relying on his knowledge, experience
and modern hairdo, succeeded in res-
cuing the workers, but in the process
the building shifted and he was
trapped. While viewers anxiously
waited to see if Mr. Brady would get
out of the building, the whole- Brady
clan behind the police barricade
started singing Christmas songs like
‘*Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer’
until Dad miraculously emerged.

Cagers continue their winning ways

 

By Jay Plotkin
Staff Reporter

They say you don’t know what you've got until it’s
gone.

Well, the Washington and Lee basketball team
now knows what it has in the friendly confines of
the Warner Center. They now know the feeling of
playing in front of hostile crowds like the ones at
Hampden-Sydney and Bridgewater. And they now

. , know what it takes to win on the road.
The Generals showed what it takes last Thursday
‘at Emory and Henry in a conference showdown
, between the Old Dominion Athletic Conference's
top two teams.

What it took was a little Hart—sophomore for-
ward Ed Hart that is— and a lot of tough, scrappy
team defense. Hart continued his consistent assault
on opponents and got support from his mates in the
, tough 62-57 win at Emory and Henry. He scored 11
’ points and grabbed five rebounds to help lead the
way for the Generals.

Senior captain Lee Brading led the team in scor-
‘ing by pumping in 14 while snaring five boards.
_ Reserve center John Witherington also played well,

scoring six points and pulling down five rebounds
‘in his first extended stretch of playing time. Said
, head coach Verne Canfield on the freshman, **As I
recall, John Witherington was in there when we
’ were [ getting two and three shots a trip], and that’s
_always nice when you can put a kid in the ballgame
and he does something constructive.’’ Witherington
‘had two baskets off offensive rebounds in the first
half.

But the man the Generals went to down the stret-
ich was sophomore center Chris Jacobs. Jacobs
_came off the bench to score 12 points in second
‘half, including four of four free throws in the final

‘

minute to put the game away, and grab seven re-
bounds. ‘*Chris showed what a man he was tonight.
He had about five key rebounds in the end where he
ripped the ball off and only gave them one shot, and
that was great,”’ said Canfield after the win.

On Saturday, the Generals returned home to the
Warner Center to take on Lynchburg College.

Said sophomore guard Jim Casey before the
game, ‘‘We’re just glad to be back playing at
home.”’

And were they ever. This one was over shortly
after the starters were introduced. After Lyn-
chburg’s Tom Kalucki scored to tie the game at
two, the Generals exploded on a 20-2 run sparked
by Jacobs and Brading. When Brading hit a three
pointer with 2:54 left in the half, the lead was 20 at
38-18. Lynchburg closed to 41-30 at the half, but
never got any closer the rest of the way.

The Generals started the second half with a 23-5
run capped by three pointers from sophomore
guards Pat Gallavan and Mike Holton to make it 64-
35, and the Generals cruised to a 90-59 win to move
to 8-1 in ODAC play.

Brading paced the Generals with 20 points and
nine rebounds. The 20 points equalled his career
high. Jacobs added 16 points while Casey pumped
in 10. Witherington came off the bench to score a
career-high eight points, his second big game in a
row. Brading has emerged as the team leader of
late, and his 20 points marked the fourth time in his
last five games in which he led the team in scoring.

Canfield said the leadership has been expected.
‘*You expect it of a senior, and we expect it of the
one we finally refer to as ‘Pops.’ That is the kind of
leadership Lee can give. He is a leader in the sense
of doing {things on the court], and he is providing
us with some excellent leadership.”’

On Tuesday night, the Generals entertained non-
conference foe Guilford, an NAIA school. It was
rumored that Guilford had 17 dunks in the first half

against Lynchburg. Well...who knows?

The first half started out well for the Generals
with some good and bad news. First, the good.
Jacobs scored the Generals’ first 10 points of the
game on 5-5 shooting. As for the bad, Brading was
whistled for two quick fouls in the first two
minutes. When Hart scored with 11:52 left, the
score was 17-13 W&L. Guilford then went on a 7-0
run sparked by Tyra Parson's dunk with 10:10 left.
The Quakers led by as many as seven (28- 21) in the
first half, led by Parson's 15 points—including four
slam dunks—but the Generals tied the score at 39
when sophomore forward Scott Alrutz scored with
five seconds remaining.

The second half started with two straight
Gallavan three pointers, and the Generals led 45-
42. The second three pointer was the fifth bomb
made by the Generals, a good sign for the W&L
faithful. The Generals are 11-0 when they have
made at least five three pointers.

After Guilford tied the score at 60, Gallavan
scored on a driving lay up to give the Generals the
lead for good with 10:26 left. Hart added 11 of his
team-high 19 points in the second half, including
two straight baskets to make the score 76-70.
Gallavan finished with 15 points off the bench to
spark the Generals, and his two free throws with 38
seconds left drove the final nail in the coffin on an
88-79 come-from-behind victory.

Hart led the way for W&L with 19 points and
nine rebounds. Jacobs finished with 16 points, and
Alrutz scored a career-high 12.

**T just asked myself who played a good game,”’
said Canfield. ‘‘Everybody did something to help
with that win.”

Next up for the 15-3 Generals is Emory & Henry

tonight in the Warner Center (Temple of Doom) at
7:30 in a rematch of last week's conference
showdown. The game will be broadcasted live on
91.5 WLUR-FM.

For Washington and Lee wrestling
head coach Gary Franke and his team,
(Tuesday’s match against Gustavus
Adolphus in Doremus Gymnasium
‘must have been like Christmas,
Thanksgiving, and April Fools Day
- all rolled into one. The Generals, who
shave battled injuries, inexperience,
ind an overall lack of participating
; wrestlers in losing five of their first

 

weight classes, bringing us to the 167-
pound class, where Franke juggled his
lineup slightly, moving freshman Peer
Soderberg up from 158. ‘‘It’s a tem-
porary move,” said Franke. ‘‘We
don’t really have a 167, but they
didn’t have many people so we wanted
to give them a match [instead of
forfeiting].””

It would turn out to be easily the
best match of the night as Soderberg
held on to win 3-2, picking up the
deciding point on the basis of more
riding time.

about Adolphus, as Franke admitted,
its likely the visitors had no idea what
they were getting into with senior
Rich Redfoot in the 190-pound class.
Redfoot, who has appeared more like
Bigfoot at times in rolling up an
outstanding 13-1-1 mark this year,
would pin his man with a scant second

**He’s got a lot of God-given ability
and a lot of experience,’ Franke said.
‘*He’s the superior wrestler on the

For the better part of the last
three months, the Washington and
Lee basketball team has been
taking to the floor rather suc-
cessfully. This week, The Ring-
tum Phi honors one of the quiet
members of the team as Athlete-of-
the-Month for January.

Although he hasn’t put up the
greatest numbers on the team, he
has been the glue that holds the
team together. His consistent play
has been one of the focal points of
‘thacoffelSive attack, and of late, he
hp¢ beerf one of the main reasons
that the Generals are 15-3 and 8-1
in the Old Dominion Athletic Con-
ference.

Edward Hart, a 6’5’’ sophomore
forward from San Antonio, Texas,
is January’s Ring-tum Phi Athlete-
of-the-Month. Since the Generals
have been back from Christmas
Break, Hart has picked up his
game. He has scored in double fig-
ures in nine of his last 10 games,
averaging 15.1 points per game
over the stretch, including a career
high 23 against Eastern Men-
nonite.

When Hart came back this
season, he found out that he had a
new role that required him to make
some adjustments, but he feels he’s
made the transition. Said Hart,
‘Originally, I was kind of ad-
justing to my new role of three

 

 

 

Ed Hart

[small forward] as opposed to
four[power forward]. I played four
most of last year. I came back after
break realizing it was more-ofan
opportunity than a bad thing. Itf¥a
lot more fun playing on_ the
perimeter, and I think I’m getting
better on my perimeter defense. I
have worked on my outside shot.’

Hart has adjusted well to his new
role. He is among the ODAC
leaders in shooting percentage,
connecting at a 57 percent clip. He
is second on the team in scoring
and rebounding, averaging 12.9
points and 5.9 rebounds per con-
test. He is also one of the team’s
better free throw shooter’s at 75.9
percent.

Right now, Hart doesn’t have a
set plan for life after graduation.
“I’m just taking it one step at a
time. I’m just kind of excited about
this year in general.”

Congratulations to Ed Hart, The
Ring-Tum Phi’s Athlete-of- the-
Month for January.

The Washington and Lee women’s
swim team breezed past Hollins last
night, 124-78, in an Old Dominion
Athletic Conference meet on the road.

The victory puts the Generals in ex-
cellent position to defend their ODAC
title of a year ago.

‘*That makes us undefeated in the
ODAC dual competitions and will set
the stage to defend our ODAC cham-
pionship title,’’ said head coach Page
Remillard. The win comes after some
excellent swims turned in by W&L
over the past weekend. Two more
school records were posted by the
Generals. The ‘women “competed
against Shepherd College and Get-
tysburg last week and broke a record
at each meet.

Seniors Elizabeth Miles and Nancy
Whalen along with sophomore Carol
Dannelly and freshman Jodi Herring
finished with a time of 3:51.28 in the
400-meter freestyle relay against
Shepherd on Friday night in Cy
Twombly Pool. Sophomore Sharon
Coleman broke yet another school
record in the Gettysburg meet on Sat-
urday with a time of 4:59.10 in the
400-meter individual medley. The
final scores of both meets were very
close, with the Generals coming out
on the short end both times. W&L lost
to Shepherd 107-97 and hung tough
with Gettysburg before falling 99- 90.
These results were especially im-
pressive since W&L was by far the
underdog in both meets.

Remillard was pleased with his

team’s weekend performances. ‘*The
ladies really swam well. They are
responding every week with top per-
formances.”’

The virus which has struck the en-
tire W&L campus has hit the team
also, but Remillard said they are con-
tinuing to swim well.

‘*You never know how the virus
will affect us in the long run, but I'm
not overly worried. Right now aca-
demics are demanding, too, so the
effects of both health worries and
classroom responsibilities are evident
in the practices.”’

The women have a layoff of sorts as
their next meet is not for 10 days. The
Generals face Mary Washington in Cy

Twombly Pool on Feb. 11 and
Remillard is hoping for a double vic-
tory from the men and women.

Men sweep two;
raise record to 5-2

The W&L men’s team improved its
record to 5-2 with a pair of wins over
Shepherd (103-70) and Gettysburg
(93-87) on Friday and Saturday.

Freshman Brad Martin in the 500
free and senior Stu Sheldon in the 200
breaststroke turned in top perfor- °
mances.

‘*We swam some guys in off events,
and we still were able to get the same
results,"” said head coach Page
Remillard.

On Saturday the men will have a
stern test on the road against Division
I William and Mary at 2 pm.

Niccolo Paganini lived again for a
short time last week in Lee Chapel as
the Cleveland Quartet gave a wonder-
ful performance on his matched set of
four Stradivarius instruments.

In their Jan. 24 concert, the world-
famous quartet played three
pieces—Felix Mendelssohn’s Quartet
in D minor, Op. 44, No. 1; Quartet
No. 2 by the Modern-American com-
poser Christopher Rouse and
Beethoven’s Quartet in B-flat major,
Op. 130.

The quartet was brought to campus
by the Washington and Lee University
Concert Guild, whose members in-
clude Timothy Gaylard, assistant pro-
fessor of music, and several W&L
students.

According to the concert program,
the Cleveland Quartet is perhaps one
of the most accomplished performing
groups in classical music today. They
have recorded extensively, have been
honored with seven Grammy Award
nominations and were selected as
“‘Best of the Year’’ by Time and
Stereo Review Magazine. They were
also the first classical group to per-
form on the televised Grammy Award
Show.

The Cleveland Quartet has been
performing for twenty years and has
just completed its first tour of the

 

satirical songs, and this year she
offers several rare finds by Gershwin.
Stevens teaches at the College of
William and Mary.

Soviet Union. They performed in six
Soviet cities and at the American em-
bassy in Moscow at the request of the
American ambassador. The quartet
has also performed all across Europe
and the United States and several films
of its performances have been made.

The members of the quartet are
Donald Weilerstein, first violinist, a
Juilliard graduate; Peter Salaff, sec-
ond violinist, who taught violin in
Chile as a member of the Peace
Corps; James Dunham, violist, a
founding member of the Sequoia Str-
ing Quartet and Paul Ketz, cellist,
who is the current editor of; the
‘‘Chamber Music Forum,’’ a column
in American String Teacher Maga-
zine.

The quartet’s members are not only
dedicated musicians, but they are also
dedicated to the teaching of their craft.
All the members are professors at the
Eastman School of Music in
Rochester, N.Y.

The instruments played by the
quartet were made by the great crafts-
man Antonio Stradivari and were
owned and played by the legendary
virtuoso Niccolo Paganini. The in-
struments—two violins, a viola and a
cello—were sold individually after
Paganini’s death but were brought
back together and donated to the Cor-
coran Gallery of Art in Washington,
D.C., which loans them to the
Cleveland Quartet.
