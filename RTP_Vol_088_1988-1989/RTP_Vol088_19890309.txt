WASHINGTON AND LEE UNIVERSITY

Big 3 results in;

Finkelstein and Dumas win

this inventory would eliminate dis-
crepancies from year to year.

 

ugh Finkelstein and Willard
Dumas were elected as president
and vice-president, respectively, of
W&L’s Executive Committee on
Monday, by a 67 percent turnout
among students.

Finkelstein, a second-year law
student from Pocono Lake, Pa.,
defeated Chris Giblin, a junior from
Washington, D.C. Dumas, a so-
phomore from New Orleans, La.,
defeated Jud Parker, a junior from
Tampa, Fla. All of the candidates
were pleased with the voter turnout
despite the rainy weather and tim-
ing of the election after Fancy Dress
weekend.

Finkelstein stressed that he will
work to enforce three main goals as
the president of the student body;
“‘T want to eliminate the ‘oral tra-
dition’ of simply handing down,
from year to year, a committee's
procedures and guidelines. Now we
want to avoid inefficiency and base
decisions on what is written
down.”’ He gave the example of
each student body committee keep-
ing an inventory of its equipment;

“Self-study committees of the
university are currently questioning
the students’ responsibility to allo-
cate funds of nearly $190,000 if
Students aren’t reliable enough to
account for what happens from year
to year,’’ Finkelstein said.

As his second goal, he said he
thought the student body needs to
be better educated about student
government. ‘‘Right now it’s a situ-
ation of alphabet soup; people
aren't sure how the EC, IFC [Inter-
fraternity Council], CRC [Confi-
dential Review Committee], SCC
{Student Conduct Committee] all
work, These groups need to better

define themselves, and convey
that.”
Thirdly, Finkelstein said he

would like to see fairness and a
greater diversity in certain commit-
tee appointments. ‘‘Nothing is au-
tomatic. We’re going to look for
who’s going to improve committees
with experience and new ideas.”’
One of Dumas’ main points as
well, he said, is the need for ‘‘more
fairness in these appointments.”’
Dumas cited in his speech last week

 

Robert Black- An “‘insider’s view’’ to the ‘‘Making of Monetary

Policy”

Black talks

about

monetary policy

By Tina Vandersteel
Staff Reporter

 

The most fascinating part of mak-
ing federal monetary policy is the
human element involved, Rich-
mond’s Federal Reserve Bank
President Robert Black said Mon-
day night in Lee Chapel.

Black, who spoke to about 100
people on ‘‘The Making of the
Monetary Policy’’ described what
he called the ‘‘insider’s view’’ of
how monetary policy is formed.
The speech was sponsored by the
University Lectures Committee and
the Commerce School. Black is a
member of the Federal Open Mar-
ket Committee, the key body for
deciding monetary policy in the
U.S. economy. He described how
the committee arrived at a decision
two weeks ago to recommend a
tightening of the money supply.

The FOMC consists of 12 mem-
bers: the seven members of the
Federal Reserve Board of Gov-
emors, the president of the New
York Federal Reserve Bank, and
four members who rotate among the
remaining 11 district bank presi-
dents.

Black said the committee meets
eight times a year, and the commit-
tee’s recommendations determine
actions generally attributed to the
Federal Reserve Board and _ its
president, Alan Greenspan.

‘*All 12 district bank presidents
attend [FOMC meetings] whether
they are voting or not,”’ he said.
‘because we always have the
power to sway opinions.”’

Speaking in terms of his experi-
ence as Richmond’s bank president,
Black said preparation for FOMC
meetings comes in two forms: in-
formal and formal. Informal prep-
aration goes on ail the time, he said.
and it includes keeping up to date
with all publications of economic
indicators.

Formal preparation, Black said.
begins two weeks prior to the meet-
ing with the release of the “‘Beige
Book,”’ which he described as a
grass-roots update of economic in-
dicators.

A few days before the meeting,
Black said, he has usually prepared
a tentative position for the meeting.

“Then comes the Blue Book,”’
Black said, joking that a color-blind
person would never make it in the
Federal Reserve System. He said
this book lists the alternatives the
Fed can consider, including expand-
ing, contracting or not changing the
money supply.

The FOMC meetings themselves,
Black said, ‘‘are pretty much what
you would expect. They start at 9
a.m., and people start talking faster
and agreeing with others more
readily as lunch hour approaches.

“You will find people piggy-
backing on others’ statements more
often come 1 p.m., ”’ Black joked.

And with 19 people evaluating
the state of the economy, he contin-
ued, ‘‘even using the same statistics
doesn’t help.”’

Black said the meeting finishes
when a directive has been drafted.
The last meeting, Black continued,
offered a very reserved suggestion
that the Fed increase existing re-
straints on the money supply.

‘*The caveats attached to the rec-
ommendation are the most impor-
tant part,’ Black said. First on the
list was a reminder to the Fed to
watch the rate of inflation, the stabi-
lization of which is currently the
Fed’s main goal.

After that, he said, ‘‘things we
wanted the Fed to take into account
were: the strength of the business
expansion, behavior of monetary
aggregates and developments ir
foreign exchange.”

The FOMC’s decision, Black
said, is ‘‘not perfect,’’ but it does
‘‘bring together the wisdom of all
19 people and their staff into a well-
informed decision about what ought
to be done about the monetary po-
licy.”

In response to the FOMC’s rec-
ommendations, on Feb, 24, the Fed
raised the discount rate, the interest
rate it charges on loans to banks, 1/2
a percentage point from 6 1/2 per-
cent to 7 percent. The Fed also

in Lee Chapel, and again when elec-
ted, that the Student Activities
Board is such a committee that
needs to be reconsidered in terms of
fairness.

When in office next year, Finkel-
stein and Dumas both said they
want to work to get the SCC ‘‘back
on its feet.”’

“*Part of the class officers’ re-
sponsibility is to serve as disciplin-
arians. The SCC members feel they
have been dealt a blow and they de-
serve more credit,’’ Finkelstein
said.

Better educating the student body
about the honor code is also a con-
cern, according to Finkelstein and
Dumas, for next year.

“I. think Chris Giblin made a
good point in his campaign that we
all feel. The honor code is some-
thing to be respected, not fear
Finkelstein said. Both stressed that
the honor system’s investigation
process before a possible closed
hearing is a fact-finding process.
‘“We ask ourselves at each step: do
we have enough here to warrant fur-
ther investigation?”’

Both Giblin and Parker plan tc
run for the positions of class rep-

EC _ finalizes

Genrenne Mongno

The Executive Committee voted
Monday night to finalize several
revisions to the White Book
concerning the selection of the
chairperson and other. officials for
a student body hearing.

The revisions, which were
drawn up by EC Member Dan
DuPre and second-year law
student John Falk, are intended to
ensure that if a problem arises
with the chairperson of a student
body hearing he or she can be
changed.

Currently, the president ot
the Student Bar Association
(SBA) serves as the chairperson
of a student body hearing. The
revisions state that upon request
of either the accused or a
majority of the EC, and
contingent upon the approval of
both parties, the chairperson may
be substituted by another member
of the SBA Board of Governors.

In addition, the revisions
state that upon the expiration of
time within which a student body
hearing may be requested, the
accused and/or the E.C. have 24

Beard 1s

Lexington’s Police Chief Bruce
M. Beard was very pleased with the
way Washington and Lee students
handled this year’s Fancy Dress
weekend.

The majority of police activity in
Lexington this weekend was not
due to W&L students. Lexington
Police made only five arrests for
drunk driving that were directly at-
tributable to FD. Chief Beard said
there were a total of seven ‘‘drunk
in public’’ incidents this weekend,
but that these were in no way all at-
tributable to W&L.

Even though more officers were
on duty over the weekend the
majority of their time was spent giv-
ing out tickets for traffic violations.

Chief Beard said the damp
weather conditions may have had
an effect on the weekend’s activi-
lies, causing people to stay inside.
This would account for the low
number of drunk in public inci-
dents.

“Tt was quicter than last year,”’
Beard said, ‘‘the fraternities com-
plied well with amplified sound
permits and there were very few ci-
tizen complaints.’’ Chief Beard said
it compared, in general, with an
average weekend during Rush.
““We answered about the same
number of calls and issued about
the same number of summonses,’
Beard said.

“Tt was my 20th Fancy Dress
Weekend,’ said Beard, ‘‘and I was
very pleased with it.”’

experience is valuable to the EC; it
would be detrimental if we did not

Last week in the Ring-tum Phi, a

If the accused and the E.C.

termine who deleted these offices
from the letter.

kept a secret for two reasons,
first because of the fun of doing
it and second because Fancy
Dress is a business. By confining
memorabilia sales before the ball
to the official merchandise sold
by the SAB a profit can be
madé, said EC President
Christopher deMovellan.

Apparently, according to
David Grove, the SAB member

or she can be changed.

 

 

Board of Governors will be
allowed to act as both an
advocate in an honor proceeding
and as chairperson of a student
body hearing during his or her
term in office.

In other business, the E.C.
and Student Activities Board
(SAB) Chairman David Grove
discussed a problem that occurred
last week when one SAB member
began selling unofficial Fancy
Dress memorabilia using the
Fancy Dress logo.

The theme of Fancy Dress is

at fault got his merchandise on
the Wednesday before the theme
was announced and began selling
it on Thursday after the theme
was announced. Grove said that
the member did not realize the
problem and when he realized he
was in error he pulled the
merchandise from sales at W&L.
Grove said he was convinced that
it was simply an impulsive idea
not premeditated to hurt the
school or the SAB.

deMovellan said it was
disappointing that the person
involved was unaware of the

“‘T think by then [Thursday when

ker. “‘It did, hopefully, encourage

damage was done, the SAB
might have been hurt. He said he
hoped in future years everyone
will be aware that those
privileged to know the theme
before the general public should
not sell any memorabilia before
the theme is officially announced
or during the time the SAB is
selling the official memorabilia.

EC Vice President Hugh
Finkelstein was elected to be next
year’s EC president in a student
body election held on Monday.
Sophomore EC member Willard
Dumas was elected vice
president, and a run-off election
for secretary between junior Jon
Sheinberg and junior Michael
Meers will be held Thursday.

The E.C. announced that
petitions for class officer/ Student
Conduct Committee
Representative and for
undergraduate E.C. representative
are due next Monday.

The meeting lasted for an
hour.

‘pleased’ with FD weekend

Staunton was also pleased with this
weekend.

“I was really pleased with the
students, they deserve a lot of cre-
dit,’’ Stevens said. Stevens said not
having a beer garden at this years’
Ball was a message by students say-
ing, “‘we don’t want it at the Ball.”’
Stevens also said that the wet
weather may have played a role in

making it a quict weekend.

He said he thought alcohol con-
sumption was down in Lexington,
especially in fraternities, but he also
said that alcohol consumption is
down on a national level as well.

The ABC in Virginia is an inde-
pendant department of the Com-
monwealth of Virginia with the
same jurisdiction and authority as

ue state police.

Stevens was the only ABC agent
on duty this weekend. He said it’s
not hard to work with W&L stu-
dents. “‘If it’s a W&L student,’’ he
said, “‘you can assume that what

they’re telling you is true.’

The only complaint Stevens had
about this year’s Fancy Dress wee-
kend was that he didn’t get a chance
to see the decorations,

 

FD- 4000 people crowded into Warner Center Friday night to dance to the music of the Lester

Lanin Orchestra at the 82nd Fancy Dress Ball.

OPINION

Improvements

at The Phi

This newspaper you are reading is a very special product.
It is the culmination of years of planning and refining.

This issue is the first time that The Ring-tum Phi has been
completely produced on the Washington and Lee campus.

Complete in-house production is an important step for The
Phi. In the past The Phi went through three work stages
over three days before the final product landed in front of
the Pit. Now, all the work is concentrated into two stages
over two days. The amount of time saved is immeasurable,
not to mention the amount of money saved.

Previously, production of the paper started on Tuesday
night with the collecting and typing of copy. Generally, it
took about five hours to type all the copy into the
computer.

Wednesday night (after all of our copy was returned to
campus from the News-Gazette) the pages were designed
and copy cut and pasted. Staff members often didn’t
struggle out of the office until 1 a.m.

Thursday mornings were the most fun, when we took care
of the final corrections, the pictures and small details. Add
another five hours.

The Phi now has its own LaserWriter that allows the staff
to produce all copy in our own office. On Thursday
morning we spend only one hour laying down pictures.

All of this is important to know as The Phi looks for
editors for next year. Gone are the days when editors were
expected to work almost 20 hours a week to put out the
paper. Editors now have unlimited control over copy and
style with relative ease. The Phi can be put together in less
than six hours. Can anyone resist the opportunity to say
they served as executive editor of the school newspaper?
Now it’s even easier.

We would be remiss if we didn’t recognize who is
responsible for the changes at The Phi. Heidi Read pushed
for the LaserWriter; she researched the possiblities, got
estimates, and convinced Brian Shaw that it was absolutely
necessary.

Publications at Washington and Lee serve an important
purpose on campus. They inform, entertain and act as a

voice of the students. Please consider serving on a
publication next year.

The Students’
newspaper

Unsigned opinions that appear in this column are those of
The Ring-tum Phi’s editorial board, which consists of the
tri-editors and the editors of the editorial page. However,
we will occasionally publish editorials that are not supported
by the entire board; those pieces carry the initials of the
author.

The Ring-tum Phi, as the Washington and Lee student
newspaper, feels an obligation to publish each and every
student-opinion piece it receives, and we encourage students
and other members of the W&L community to submit
letters or “‘My Views.’’ However, we reserve the right to
edit any and all submissions for reasons of taste, libel,
clarity or length.

The Phi is your newspaper, not ours. The quality and
diversity of its opinion page is dependent on your
submissions.

Any student interested in serving as
editor of The Ring-tum Phi next year
should submit a letter of interest to the
Publications Board by 5 p.m. on March
17. Interviews will be conducted on
Monday, March 20. The board’s office
is in room 208 of the University Center.

The Ring-tum Phi is published every Thursday during the undergraduate school year
at Washington and Lee University, Lexington, Virginia. Funding for The Ring-tum Phi
comes primarily from advertising and from a portion of the student activities fee. The
Publications Board elects the chief editors and business manager, but The Ring-tum Phi
is otherwise independent.

Letters to the Editor and submissions must be in The Ring-tum Phi office, Room 208 of
the Student Center, by 5 p.m. Tuesday of the week they are to be run. Or send them to
The Ring-tum Phi, Box 899, Lexington, VA 24450. This newspaper observes current
court definitions of libel and obscenity.

 

Talk about deja vu. It seems
like just last week we were
complaining that film director
Martin Scorsese should have been
more sensitive and less offensive to
Christianity in bringing The Last
Temptation of Christ to the big
screen, And now the same scolding
seems appropriate for Salman
Rushdie, whose Satanic Verses fired

a big round across the bow of |

Islam.
The similarity of course ends

there; as far as we know, there
weren’t any contracts out on
Scorsese’s head. Westerners,
accustomed to contrary opinions,
have become used to hearing ideas
they find offensive. (But then, it
may not be such a good thing that
most Christians accepted The Last
Temptation without even a murmur
of protest; maybe a middle ground
between Khomeni-style outrage and
American apathy would have said
more for the degree of conviction
Western Christians attach to their
beliefs.)

Anyway, given the lesson in
‘tolerance ‘just learned, it Seéms

firing off extremist, outrage-laden
condemnations of Khomeni is not
the most prudent course; in fact,
Rushdie’s hat may not be all white,
and (dare we say it?) the
Ayatollah’s not all black.

While it is certainly necessary
to condemn Khomeni’s death
threats, it seems a few stones should
also be lobbed Rushdie’s way.
Certainly he has the right to say
whatever he wants, but is legality
all that matters? As Islamic scholar
John Esposito recently told U.S.
News and World Report, religious
affronts are, ‘‘tricky waters’’ that
call for at léast some amount of

self-censorship. ‘‘The
Amendment right doesn’t mean you
should automatically say everything
you want to,”’ and, says Esposito,

there’s no one knowledgeable about.-«
Islam who couldn’t have seen an...

explosion coming.
Regardless _ of

appropriate, some degree of Islamic
anger is -- and Western Christians,

with Scorsese’s film fresh in their +

memories, should be at least

somewhat empathetic.

Bizarre weather and bizarre weddings

MY VIEW

By Jon Sbar

After years of carbon monoxide,
acid rain, nuclear waste and apple
cores which are supposed to
disintegrate, Mother Nature decided
to get even with the human race.
She would start another ice age and
freeze everyone to death.

Right about the time she was
getting the Poles ready for her icy
revenge, Mother Nature’s good
friends February and March came
to her with an even better idea.
March, being sunny and full of
flowers, would sneak into February’s
place and make all the humans think
it was spring, and February, being
grey and cold, would hit the world
with a surprise attack. Mother
Nature was keen on the idea but
first wanted to give it a trial run in
her home state of Virginia. So far,
her plan is working.

Since we’re on the subjects of

 

To the Editors:

To Lip Synchers

aberrations of Nature it would only
be right to discuss a recent (six
months ago) Miss Manners column
on the subject of Nude Weddings.
Before stripping away the misconceptions
surrounding this exciting and fleshy
topic, the reader requires some historical
background on Miss Manners.
Zsa Zsa ‘‘The Chest’’ Garbonzi
was at the pinnacle of her career as
a topless dancer at the Zanzabar
Lounge (making over $100 in tips
on a good night) when her dentist
(under the influence of nitrous
oxide) make the mistake of giving
her a frontal lobotomy. At that
point, Zsa Zsa quit her job, changed
her name to Miss Manners and
became an advice columnist. Now
she informs concemed readers
which way they should pass red
cabbage around the table and
whether or not it’s acceptable to
blow your nose on the table cloth
at grandmother’s house.
Now, back to the tantalizing topic
of Nude Weddings. The letter from
a concerned mother can be

summarized as follows:

1) The good news is my only
daughter plans to be married.
2) The bad news is that she and
the groom plan on being nude for
the ceremony.

3) When I invite my friends to the
wedding, should I mention the

nudity factor, and if so, how

should it be done?

Let’s analyze question 3.
Assuming the mother tells her
friends about the unique wedding
conditions, let’s consider some of
her options. First, the subtle
approach:

Dear Friends, We request the
honor of your presence at the
marriage of our daughter,
Bethelda Rupperdome, to
Poindexter Madison on Saturday,
February 15. Reception and
dinner to follow.

P.S. The bride and groom will be
slightly indecent.

Now the blunt approach:

Dear Friends, Our nutso daughter
and her fruitcake fiance came up

too

with the ridiculous idea to get

married in the buff, so if you ©

come, expect to see a butt-naked
bride and gvoom. The minister
will probably be wearing a G-

string and I bet the maid of '

honor shows up in a_ black

negligee.

Despite the mother’s fears, I
imagine the wedding had perfect «

attendance. If you were invited I

bet you’d go. What could liven up‘
those boring wedding vows more''y

than naked participants?

For most W&L students, the
eek after Fancy Dress marks a
turn to an academic reality long
irgotten during four nights and
iys of parties. To department
‘ads, however, this week begins
e long and arduous task of filling
icant faculty positions for the next
‘ademic year.

‘There will be several new faces
2xt year,’’ said Larry C. Peppers,
van of the School of Commerce,
conomics and Politics. He said
iree new faculty members have
ven hired for next year.

The new instructors are Robert
trong, an associate professor of
dlitics at Tulane University, who
‘ill head the politics department;
/illiam King, an associate professor
f accounting at Emory University
id Kip Pirkle, an associate
rofessor at Old Dominion
‘niversity who will join the

ousiness administration staff.

Politics Professor William
Buchanan is retiring and Assistant
Professor of Accounting Arthur
Gumenik is returning to graduate
school.

The mathematics department is
also looking for one or two new
faculty members, according to
Professor Robert Johnson. ‘‘We
hope to find someone to deal with
numerical analysis, ’’ Johnson said,
““‘but we are not restricting our
search to just that.’’

The biology department is also
interviewing to fill one temporary
and two permanent positions.
Thomas G. Nye, professor of
biology, said permanent
appointments will be made in the
fields of immunology and genetics.
The one temporary position in
zoology will relieve Cleveland
Hickman who will be on sabbatical
next year, said Nye.

Two other departments are trying
to fill vacancies because of

professors’ departures. The
psychology department is looking
for a one-year replacement for
Nancy Margand, who will be on
leave next year. The fine arts
department will be hiring a new
East Asian art history professor to
take over for I-Hsiung Ju, who is
retiring at the end of this year.

Several departments have solved
their faculty vacancy problems by
granting permanent positions to
some members who formerly held
temporary instructor status. In the
history department, Roberta H.
Senechal will stay on as an assistant
professor.

The English department has
given a_ full-time position to
Demaree C. Peck, currently a
temporary instructor, who will
concentrate on 20th century
American fiction. Peck and Cathryn
Hankla, an instructor from Hollins
College, are the newest assistant
professors of English.

A Washington and Lee senior was
‘ecently awarded a scholarship to
ittend a five-day direct-marketing
nstitute in Chicago over February
oreak.

Jeffrey Schultz, a senior French
najor from Oklahoma City, was one
of 30 students hand-picked for the
institute by the Direct Marketing
Association Educational Foundation.
Most of the students selected were
from colleges and universities in the
Midwest. Schultz was one of two
people selected from the East Coast.

Schultz said he learned about the
institute from his father, who is head
of the advertising department at
Northwestern University.

The institute consisted of five days
of seminars designed to serve as an
introduction to direct marketing.

Schultz said direct- marketing is
a "sub-field" of advertising that
involves selling to a specific group
of people. Speakers at the institute
included presidents of 10 direct
marketing companies.

Schultz said he is planning on a
career in the field of direct

marketing. Following graduation
this year, he plans to attend
‘Northwestern, where he will study
for a master’~ degree in marketing.

Roach awarded
Pinney prize

 

By Tina Vandersteel
Staff Reporter

 

The Student Affairs Committee
last week chose John Roach, a
senior from Frankfurt, Ky., to be the
recipient of the 1989 Edward L.
Pinney Prize.

According to the description in
the W&L catalog, the prize recog-
nizes extraordinary commitment
both to personal scholarship and to
the nurturing of intellectual life at
WAL. It was established by the fa-
culty in 1982 in memory of the late
Edward Lee Pinney, who was a
professor of politics from 1963 until
his death in 1980.

Roach said he thought the recog-
nition involved with the award is
good because “‘it makes you think
like everything you do is worth it.”’

Asked why he thought he was
chosen, Roach said he thought it
was because of his general inquisi-
tive attitude. ‘‘] always challenge
things in an intellectual way,’’ he
said, ‘‘whether it’s the administra-
tion or just in class.’’

Dean of Students Lewis John,
who serves as chairman of the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee, described
in a memo soliciting nominees for
the prize, the criteria for selecting
winners.

The memo said,‘‘Pinney was an
individual who consistently raised
significant and difficult questions

about the educational tife at the
university; he was particularly
adept at forcing both students and
colleagues to think carefully about
their observations and educational
values.”’

John said the prize consists of
two books chosen by Roach’s major
departments, a certificate, and a
cash prize provided by the Pinney
endowment.

Roach is a history and economics
major, and he serves as chairman of
Contact. He is a member of Omi-
cron Delta Kappa and has served on
the coeducational steering commit-
tee, the sorority advisory commit-
tee, and the Mock Convention
committee. He is treasurer of the
Kappa Sigma fraternity and also
treasurer of the Interfraternity
Council.

organizing
to protect
waterfowl

 

From Staff Reports

 

Local outdoorsmen are forming
a Rockbridge chapter of Ducks
Unlimited, the national organization
devoted to the conservation of
waterfowl habitat. The chapter will
hold its Charter Banquet on April
27 at Evans Dining Hall.

The banquet will feature door
prizes, a raffle and an auction.
Organizers expect to have a wide
variety of items available to be won
or bought. A limited edition Ducks
Unlimited shotgun is the raffle prize.
Door prizes and auction items will
range from decoys and shotguns to
outdoor and raffle equipment.

Tickets for the Charter Banquet
cost $40 for singles and $60 for
couples. The price of the ticket
includes a $20 membership fee for
Ducks Unlimited. Those who are
already members pay $20 for a
single ticket and $40 for a couples
ticket.

Organizers of the local chapter
stress the fact that Ducks Unlimited
is not a hunting club. The
organization was incorporated in
1937 and now has nearly 550,000
members. Over the course of its
first SO years, Ducks Unlimited has
translated the $436 million it has
raised on behalf of wild ducks and
geese into more than 5 million acres
of reserved wetland habitat in
Canada, the United States and
Mexico. These acres are utilized
by more than 600 wildlife species,
including several that are
endangered.

Virginia has more than 70
chapters of Ducks Unlimited, with
a total membership of almost 13,000.
Last year, the chapters raised nearly
$350,000 for wetland projects within
the state.

Wetlands are drained routinely at
the rate of up to 400,000 acres each
year in this country alone. As long
as this loss continues, ducks, geese
and a long list of other wildlife
species will be forced to seek
temporary and highly unsuitable
homes.

Organizers state that if Rockbridge
areas outdoorsmen and
outdoorswomen want to do
something about stemming. this
wetland loss and have a good time
doing it, they should plan on joining
the new Rockbridge chapter of
Ducks Unlimited and attending the
Charter Banquet on April 27,

Ticket information is available by
calling Dick Moore at 463-4587 or
John McDaniel at 463-4108.

McDaniel at 463-8791, Coach Gary

W&L students benefit from

Staff Reporter

 

Thirty-nine W&L students will
spend spring term in six Soviet
cities and W&L sophomore
Garrick Slate will be attending
classes during the upcoming
school year in Moscow.

History Professor Richard
Bidlack may be setting a new
spring term tradition by leading
the first group of W&L students
to travel in the USSR. Slate is
part of the initial group of
American under-graduate students
to study at Soviet universities.

Bidlack said of the program,
“The idea is © twa @
Gorbachev’s changes, but put
squarely in the context of Soviet
history.”’

A look at Soviet history reveals
there were several reform efforts
in the 1920s and 1960s. The
1980s reform movements of
peresuoika and glasnost resemble
these earlier efforts, said Bidlack.

The group will be traveling to
six cities in the USSR, including
Moscow, Tbilisi and Leningrad.
Tbilisi is the hometown of one of

peculiar date or remembering nothing at all.

I will remember the 82nd Washington and Lee

Other people remembered various events of the
weckend, especially freshmen who had heard about
Fancy Dress since the beginning of the year.

“T expected it to be like a prom, with a really
negative attitude, but it was MUCH better,”’ said

The general consensus of the freshmen was that

the Soviet exchange students at
W&L, Nona Mchedlishvili.

Mchedlishvili said the Tbilisi
trip will allow the students to
make important observations
about the USSR.

“It helps them to see that the
Soviet Union is kind of a union
of countries,’ she said.

Mchedlishvili said USSR
republics are more individually
distinctive than the American
states. Each republic has its own
culture and language.

‘“‘They can at least see a not
Russian republic. They can
compare how much difference is
between them. To learn
something, they have to begin
from this,”’ said Mchedlishvili.

Students who are traveling to
the USSR must choose a topic
for a 10 to 15 page paper
focusing on some aspect of
reform. The actual trip is a 24-

hour-a-day, 4-week opportunity
for research with primary
resources,

Journalism major George
Sparacio, a senior, wants to speak
to journalists and journalism
students in the USSR about his
paper on journalism and
censorship. With two years of
Russian studies, including
language, politics, history and
literature classes,  Sparacio’s
background is far more extensive
than most of his fellow travelers.

Mchedlishvili said the group
will be well-received by the
Soviet peoples. ‘‘Different styles
of life, different systems,
sometimes you think the people
are different,’’ Mchedlishvili said.
“Americans always are very
special guests.’’ Mchedlishvili’s
words must be especially good
news to Slate. He was warned
by a program adviser that school
and life in the USSR will be
challenging for an American.

enthusiastic about going, after
two months you'll say, ‘Oh my
God, why am I here?’ If you’re

Among complaints were the rain, ‘‘heinous’’ blind

dates, Saturday morning athletic practices and dates
who just never showed up.

“‘T think that if someone didn’t have a good time,
then it had to do with their date, not the ball,’’ said
freshman Elise Bryant.

“The bad thing about a weekend-long date is ,

that at other parties you can’t look at other girls, so
it kind of hurts when you’re tied down for the whole

If, however, this is not true and

only W&L student going to the
USSR next year since he is the
only student who meets the three-

requirement is a necessity.

Slate will be going to school

Rich Redfoot

 

Golfers set to tee up

 

 

 

By Jay Plotkin
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Last year, senior Rich
Redfoot took the season off
from wrestling. This season,
he finished fifth in the NCAA
Division III tournament,
earning All-America honors,
W&L’s first ever All-
American in wrestling.

For his accomplishment’s
Redfoot has been named The
Ring-tum Phi's Athlete-of-the-
Month for February.

As a sophomore, Redfoot
was 17-6 and qualified for the
NEAA Division Ill
tournament, while leading the
team in takedowns. This
year, the senior from
Chehalis, Washington, started
at 177 pounds, but midway
through made the step up to
190. He breezed through the
regular season with a record

despite early trouble

By Mike Shady
Snorts Editor

 

The past eight months have not
been particularly kind to the
Washington and Lee golf team.

In that time span, the Generals,
the defending Old Dominion
Athletic Conference champions, lost
four of their top golfers to
graduation. And if that wasn’t bad
enough, the team also lost a
regulation practice facility as all 18
greens at W&L’s home course, the
Lexington Country Club, were
damaged prior to the start of the
fall season due to fertilization
problems.

Add to that the fact that the
spring weather in the Shenandoah
Valley has done its best
impersonation of Norther Alaska,
and you have a situation that is not
conducive to the golfers getting out
of the gate with a fast start.

But head coach Buck Leslie,
whose team finished with a 9-3
record last season and a bid to the
NCAA Division III __ national
championships last season, as well
as that ODAC title, remains patient
and optimistic.

‘“*‘We just have to do what we

an,” he said.

The main obstacle Leslie has had
to face has been greens travesty.
The Generals have been practicing
at the Lexington Country Club with
temporary greens, which basically
amounts to a flag stick to shoot at
from the fairway. To compound
matters, the course has also been
shortened dramatically because of
the greens problem.

This has caused Leslie, who has
never had a losing season in his 14
years at the W&L golf helm, much
trouble in terms of making fair

assessments of the young players
trying out for the team this season,
especially of their short games.

“It has been a difficult thing to
evaluate,’” he said. ‘‘It’s going to
take some time tc really sort them
out.”

One thing Lod: can count on
is the play of returning seniors Tom
Wingfield and Pete Coleman. Both
players were key contributors in last
season’s successful finish.

“‘They’re are only carry over
{from last year’s team],’’ Leslie
said. ‘‘They both have excellent
work habits which is a big plus for
both of them.”

Those two wili lead the Generals
into this weekend’s James Madison
Invitational in Harrisonburg.
Joining Wingfield and Coleman will
be sophomore Brian Kopet and
freshmen Jay McKnight and David
Carroll. Leslie, however, says this
is, by no means, the set lineup for
future matches,

“There has been tremendous
competition among the players,’’ he
said. ‘‘They [the freshmen] can
sense the opportunity to play.”’

But it’s the lack of play on
regulation tees and regulation greens
that has drawn the head coach’s
most concern, and will most likely
give W&L problems ais weekend.

‘“‘We might get hurt around the
greens, but that’s natural,’’ said
Leslie. ‘‘This is the first step in a
series of steps and it’s going to take
time before we can work it out.”’

But isn’t the short game one of
-- if not the -- most important facets
of golf?

“‘That’s what it comes down to,”
he said. ‘‘As the pros always say,
“You drive for show, but you putt
for dough.’”’

Did the year he took off

According to Redfoot, no.

“IT don’t think the year off
really hurt. I was getting
kind of burned out. I’ve been
wrestling for quite a while. I
think it helped as far as that,
being motivated a little bit

Said Redfoot, ‘‘I knew it

Redfoot defeated Danko in

‘The first match wasn’t

Women’s tennis split two

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
tennis team has begun its quest for
the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference championship and an
NCAA ranking. The Generals made
two road trips last week, and their
record now stands at 1-1.

Though the Generals showed signs
that they are not in peak form, they
were able to pull out a victory last
Thursday against Virginia
Commonwealth University. After
four matches, VCU led 3-1, with
the win coming from freshman
Colleen Quinn at No. 4 singles, 6-
4, 6-4.

The Generals drew even at 3-3
after the singles behind three-set
wins from senior Benny Savage and
junior Teresa Southard.

As the sun began to set, the
temperature dropped, and it looked
as if the match would be postponed
due to poor playing conditions. The
VCU coach, however, made do with
what little lighting was working, and
sent out the Nos. 1 and 2 doubles
teams. The matches were shortened
to eight game pro-sets due to the
conditions.

The pressure was on for W&L

Senior midfielder Stu  Geisel
opened the scoring in the second
period, scoring with 14:07 left in
the half. The teams then traded
goals, with Ware getting his third
goal to make the score 5-2 W&L.
With just five seconds left in the
half, sophomore attackman Brian
Overbeck found midfielder Chris
Mastrogiovanni open in the
crease, and the junior scored to
give the Generals a 6-2 halftime
lead.

Then, to begin the second half,

not to lose the season opener, and
the Generals responded to the
challenge as both of the W&L
(cams won tight matches.
Sophomore Jean Stroman and Quinn
won 8-6, and sophomores Kathy
Leake and Kelly Martone
immediately followed with an 8-5
victory. The No. 3 doubles team
did not play, making the final score
5-3 in W&L’s favor.

“We didn’t play that well,” said
co-head coach David McLeod. ‘‘We
started out rusty. Inclement weather
has severely hampered our practice
time. However, we played hard and
we were able to win the close
matches. That was the difference.
Our doubles is definitely our strong
point this year,”’

Things were not quite so pleasant
on Tuesday when the Generals took
on another Division | team, Virginia
Tech, The Hokies defeated the
Generals 9-0. ‘‘We got an old-
fashioned butt-whupping,’’ said
McLeod.

The Generals get a chance to
perform at home this weekend.

and Saturday with teams Emory &
Henry, Randolph-Macon (Ashland),
and Virginia Wesleyan participating.

Geisel won the faceoff and

seconds. That goal started a six

quarter.

“‘We scored with five seconds

half,’ said head coach Dennis

Women’s lacrosse starting with high hopes

 

oe

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

Optimism. That is the one word
that epitomizes the Washington and
Lee women’s lacrosse team as it
enters its first varsity season. And
this optimism is not without basis,
either.

As a club sport last year, the
Generals posted a respectable 4-7
record in exhibition games. Enough
success to satisfy any head coach,
right? Wrong. This season, with
more experience and new recruits,
the caliber of talent on the squad
has risen and W&L has set its goals
even higher.

“T have high expectations, I
guess,’’ said head coach Janine
Hathom. ‘‘I honestly think we
stand a good chance of being .500
or better. I think we can do quite
well.”

Hathorn, also the coach of
W&L’s women’s soccer team, is no
Stranger to success with a fledgling
program. She turned that team into
contenders in just its second year
at varsity status, a performance that
earned her Old Dominion Athletic
Coach-of-the- Year honors. She sees
those same sorts of positives in her

(continued from page 6)

being a 5-2 ball game to a 7-2
game, and that’s a big difference.
I think those two goals were
probably the two key goals of the

ball game.”’
Geisel, sophomore Todd
Garliss, _ Moseman, freshman

Drew Anton and Ware, who got
his fourth goal of the day, all
found the net for W&L in the
period.

Freshman Matt Zamaloff scored
in the fourth quarter to give the
Generals their final 13-3 margin
of victory.

Once again, sophomore Tom
Costello was stellar in goal,
making eight saves.

“T think our team is playing
with confidence right now,’’ said
Daly. ‘“‘I think the team is

, confident in Tommy [Costello],

  

lacrosse team.

“Tam very excited about this
team and this program,”’ she said.
“The interest has been high, we’ve
had a good number of people out,
and they’ve been working hard and
responding to all the demands.”’

Although it is exciting to be

competing at the varsity level,
Hathorn looks at the transition as
creating a few difficulties for the
Generals.
“Relatively, we may not seem to
do much better than last year for
two reasons,” she said. ‘‘First, we
have more games. Second, as a
new team [last season] we got to
play without following all the rules.
For example, we could sub
whenever we wanted. This year
we’re within the rules and, since we
are a varsity team, our opponents
are going to be playing to beat us
more.”’

There is a good supply of talent
that should be up to the challenge,
however. Last year’s team Most
Valuable Player, sophomore Katy
Richard, returns as do 11 other
letterwinners. Senior Stephanie
Smith, the Coach’s Award winner,
will join forces with Richard and

It is a tremendous boost to the
team to know that the man in
between the pipes is going to
cover for their mistakes.

On Wednesday, the Generals
opened their Old Dominion
Athletic Conference season
against the Yellow Jackets of
Randolph-Macon College.

It was a game in which Daly
thought the Generals needed to
score early and often to defeat
the Yellow Jackets.

W&L managed to take an early
lead, scoring with just 1:04 gone
into the game. Ware scored the
goal off an assist from Overbeck.
Macon tied the game at the end
of the quarter on a goal with 45
seconds left.

W&L.--then-----scored----two
unanswered goals in the second
period to take a 3-1 lead at
halftime. Mastrogiovanni scored
with 14:09 left in the half off an
assist from Moseman. Then with
11:37 left, Ware found Anton for
the freshman’s second goal of the
season.

sophomore Brooke Tinley to lead
the Generals’ offense. Freshmen
Whitney Hopkins and Julie Vennes
should play important roles at
midfield, while senior Alston Parker,
junior Melissa Jones, and
sophomores Melinda Conkling and
Anne Gregory shore up the defense.
Freshman Erica Ingersoll is expected
to handle the goalkeeping duties.

Those freshmen could prove
important as the 24-member team
is composed of nine freshmen.

“The freshman class is going to
boost our whole level of play,’’ said
Hathorn.

W&L’s strategy is to gain
victories against the teams the
Generals defeated or played close
last season, while narrowing the
scoring margin against those schools
who beat W&L handily. Hathorn
thinks the goal of 8-7 is possible,
based on the enthusiasm and hard
work the team has shown in the
preseason.

“If we can keep up our positive
experiences and they are any
indication of how we’ll play, we’ ll
perform very well,’ said Hathorn.

The Generals begin their season
Friday at home at 4 p.m. on Liberty
Hall Field against Frostburg.

In the second half, things just
didn’t go the Generals way.
Randolph-Macon scored in once
in the third quarter and then
twice early in the fourth to take a
4-3 lead. Ric Westervelt scored
two of the goals, both unassisted.
J.D. Macey’s second goal of the
game gave the Yellow Jackets the
lead with 11:47 left.

W&L then looked to its All-
American, and Ware came
through.

With the Generals on the power
play, Ware scored unassisted to
tic the game with 6:47 left. It
was the second straight multiple
goal game from Ware.

The game remained tied
through regulation and one

W&L had opportunities to end
the game. Randolph-Macon

Harrington found Westervelt open
in front of the net, and his third
goal of the day from 20 feet out
gave the Yellow Jackets a 5-4
win, their first ever over the
Generals.

Said Daly after the game, ‘‘We
dominated them in every phase of
the game, except the score, and I
guess that’s why they keep the
score. You don’t get extra points
for picking up ‘x’ number of
ground balls.”’

WA&L outshot R-MC 55-17, had
an 89-57 groundball advantage,
won 12 of the 13 faceoffs and
had a much higher success rate
clearing the ball.

““We just have to put this loss
behind us and concentrate on
Franklin & Marshall,’’ said Daly.
“T hope I was prophetic when I
said that the ODAC champion
would have one loss.

Next up for the 1-2, 0-1

will be played Saturday on

Wilson Field at 2:00.

See monkey see,
Sea monkey do

Something has been bugging me all year long and I finally figured it out
the other night. It was your ordinary evening at the sports editor's residence
-- pizza in one hand, remote control in the other -- and while flipping back
and forth between MTV's Martha Quinn (Talk about scary late-night TV) and
her new show, Deja-Video, and ESPN's uncomfortable-as-hell-to-watch Tim
Brando and Sportscenter, the answer, or more the question, hit me. Why is
W&L’s nickname, the ‘‘Generals,’’ so boring? In a country where the
Spiders of Richmond, the Salukis of Southern Illinois and the Hoyas of
Georgetown exist, why must a dubuhyueneller be referred to as someone who
most likely smokes cigars, is overweight and says intelligent things like
“‘Peace is made possible only through war."’?

Well, you say, because Robert E. Lee and George Washington were
generals, stupid. Not good enough, at least for me, anyway. Nicknames
were (and are) made up by sportswriters, mainly to make their jobs easier
when it comes to writing games stories and the like. So, why should we be
stuck with somebody else’s nickname? Just because the name ‘‘Generals”’
popped up in some clown’s story, we've been christened as such for eternity?
I think not. Besides, we don’t even have a person dress up as a General for
sporting events. And what about the women’s teams (this is an issue my
predecessor brought up). A woman cannot obtain the ranking of five-star
general because it requires combat duty, something women are not allowed
to perform in this man’s Army. You can’t put ‘‘Lady’’ in front of
“‘Generals’’ because what you end up with is a very bad oxymoron, and no
one wants to be known as a moron of any kind. And aren't you sick of
people sarcastically telling you how clever your school is for coming up with
such an appropriate nickname?

Therefore, I turn your attention to that glistening example set forth by the
students of the University of California at Santa Cruz. Two years ago they
were called the Sea Lions (booooormriiinnnggg). Now, after a school-wide
vote and petition, they are known as the infamous Banana Slugs (Yes! The
Banana Slugs). Not bad for a bunch of burned out surfer heads.

The time has come to top these beach bums and demand a change in the
school nickname. And, since sportswriters started this whole mess, I feel
qualified in making the choice for the nickname. Ready? How does the
Washington and Lee Sea Monkeys grab ya?

Think about it. First, the controversy. What exactly is a Sea Monkey?
Is it really an animal? Is it even alive? And what does a Sea Monkey
actually do?

Second, the possibilities. Students can be handed little packets of sea
monkeys (to be billed home, of course) in the matriculation line each fall.
We can have sea monkey T-shirts, baseball caps and sweatshirts -- stuff we
don’t have with the Generals moniker on them. How about a huge aquarium
in the Warner Center lobby with royal blue and white sea monkeys floating
around in it? (I’m sure they exist in these colors, although I confess I am not
well read in sea monkey literature) We can have Sea Monkey Day or Sea
Monkey Week. Visiting teams will be totally bewildered when they compete
against the W&L Sea Monkeys. What's your game plan for a Sea Monkey?
And, while we're at it, we should take down that statue of that pansy George
Washington and replace instead with a likeness of a sea monkey. | think,
tastefully done, a sea monkey would add a touch of class to the red bricks
and white columns of the colonadde.

Third, the song. Let’s change the words to the W&L Swing. How’s this
for openers:

Come cheer for Washington and Lee/
The home of the cool sea monkey!

Fourth and finally, the school spirit. Wouldn’t you be proud to root for
a sea monkey? I know I would. And don’t let appearances fool you, either.
Sea monkeys are tough -- much tougher than a general could ever be.

The time has come for a change. I even have a battle cry for when we
storm Washington Hall, petition in hand. ‘‘Give us sea monkeys, or give us
death!’’ Robert E. Lee would have been proud.

Tourist is year’s best film

 

W&L Weekly Calendar.

 

Receives Academy Award nods for Best Picture and Supporting Actress

 

By Michael Tuggle
Entertainment Editor

 

Macon Leary is a little bit
different than you and me.
Different, because Macon Leary
lives in a world where everything
is well-organized, unemotional
and to some extent drab. He
seems to thrive’ on __ the
consistency that a never changing
life offers. He lives his life in the
same ever changing world that
the rest of us live in, but unlike
the rest of us, Macon ignores it.

Macon Leary is only the first
of the phenomenal characters who
Anne Tyler develops in her
acclaimed novel The Accidental
Tourist, the film version of
which starring William Hurt,
Kathleen Tumer and Geena Davis
hasbeen nominated for a 1989

Academy Award Best Picture
award.
The story follows Macon

(Hurt), a writer who writes travel
guides under the guise of The
Accidental Tourist. Leary and his
wife Sarah (Turner) begin the
film one year after their son was
needlessly killed by a man
holding up a store. Sarah has
decided at the beginning of the
film that she wants to divorce
Macon because she can’t stand
the way he has dealt with the
death of his son alone without
her.

Following the split, Macon
has to leave for London to gather
information for a new travel
guide. Before leaving, however,
Macon has to drop his Welsh
Corgie Edward at the kennel. It
is here that he meets Muriel
Pritchett (Davis), the one kind of
woman who it seems Macon
could never understand or come
close to loving. It is through this
relationship, though, that Macon
finds out who he really is.

The Accidental Tourist is an
incredibly well-made, beautiful
film that, in my mind, deserves
the Academy Award for Best
Picture. Although Dustin Hoffman

  
 

gave the performance of a

Rain Man, The
Accidental Tourist is on the
whole a better film. Nothing
about the film is lacking in
anything. The casting, the writing,
the direction and_ the
cinematography are all
overwhelming. To some
moviegoers the film might tend
to. drag briefly in a few places,
but viewed in context of the
entire film, it almost seems
intentional.

The Accidental Tourist is a
film that has a little bit of
everyone in it. Too often we rush
through life forgetting that
everything we do and everyone
we meet make up what we call
life. In retrospect, life is not a
chain of appointments made, bills
that were paid or time that was
spent fulfilling the same schedule
day after day. Life is a series of
experiences that uniquely
influence a part of our lives in
addition to permanently changing
the way we think or feel from
that point forward.

In addition to the Best Picture
nomination, The Accidental
Tourist received a_ Best
Supporting Actress nomination for
Ceena Davis for her role as
Muriel, a Best Adapted
Screenplay nomination for Frank
Galati and Lawrence Kasdan
(who sas sadly looked over in
the directing nominations) and a
Best Musical Score nomination
for John Williams.

As stated, the casting was
superb. Reunited for the first time
since Body Heat, William Hun
and Kathleen Turner are again
wonderful together. While Turner
does her usual good job with the
small role she is given, Hurt, like
Kasdan, was sadly overlooked.
His performance is not of
Hoffman’s magnitude (whose is
this year?), but he certainly
deserved a nomination.

As her Oscar nomination
suggests, Geena Davis is
wonderful. She plays Muriel right

io the edge of the unbelievable,
but then slams on the brakes and
never crosses the line. She is a
fine actress who deserves many
more quality parts than what she
is getting.

As for her competition (Joan

McDormand for Mississippi
Burning and Michelle Pfeiffer
for Dangerous Liaisons), it is
tough. Stull though, Davis has just
