Heated debate swells over the new-
dly-formed Confidential Review
Committee as to whether the commit-
‘tee usurps student power on campus.
<The CRC had its first meeting Tues-
day night.

The CRC, composed of four faculty
members and three students, met to
develop a set of policies and proce-
dures that will be effective in dealing
With cases of sexual, racial or reli-
gious slurs and sexual harassment.

* The CRC was formed by a faculty
yote last spring after an ad hoc review
committee decided that there was not a
sufficient outlet for complaints of es-

ially sensitive subject matter.
enny Bray, a Co-head Dorm Counse-
lor who served on the ad hoc review
committee, said the campus needed to
pay ‘“‘increased attention to the fact
that students with these types of con-
cerns felt unable to approach the Stu-
dent Conduct Committee,’ which
formerly had jurisdiction over these
matters.

“SCC Chairmen David Burns and
Wade Fricke voiced their opposition
to the CRC at an EC meeting last
Monday night. Fricke believes that the
=SCC has lost ‘‘one of their most im-
portant roles.’’ Burns said last year’s
SCC president, Mike Henry, “‘gave
the opinion that the SCC did not feel
comfortable with those kinds of
eases.’’ But, Burns added, Henry con-
sulted neither the SCC in full, nor in-
dividual members about this view-
point.

+ Senior Greg Dale said at the EC
meeting that the CRC takes away
power from the student body, since
the CRC has a majority of faculty
members. Burns concurred with this
Viewpoint, saying, ‘‘I think the stu-
dents can handle it.”’

+ However, last year the SCC heard
only two cases of sexual harassment.
Fourteen other cases of sexual har-
assment were heard by Dean Anece F.
McCloud, Associate Dean of Minor-

       

 

   

ity Students and International Affairs.
Professor Samuel J. Kozak, head of
the CRC and head of the ad hoc re-
view committee said, ‘‘The students
(on the review committee) decided
there was a lacking in the way to
handle sexual, racial and religious
slurs.’

Kozak wants to see the CRC be-
come a ‘‘vehicle (for) sensitive issues
that require confidence, that will en-
courage people to come forward so
that their problems can be recog-
nized.””

Burns would like to see the SCC
strive for higher levels of confidentia-

issues in mind, Kozak said. The CRC
has four faculty members to eliminate
situations where students ‘‘are reluc-
tant to go before a committee of their
peers,”’ Kozak said.

The four faculty members who are
on the CRC are Kozak of the Geology
Department, Steven Hobbs of the law
school, Ann Rogers, a Japanese
professor and Barbara Brown, the
University Librarian, The three stu-
dent members are Kathryn Kirmayer,
a law student, Amy Smith, a senior,
and James Rambo, a sophomore.

The CRC membes were selected

‘*... the SCC did not feel comfortable with
those kinds of cases.’’

--David Burns

 

lity. The SCC is composed of 13
members, which Burns admitted can
cause problems in protecting high
levels of confidentiality because of the
number of people involved.

Both Burns and Fricke suggested
several options for the SCC to con-
sider in order to maintain jurisdiction
over sexual complaints. ‘‘A smaller
board of the SCC could deal with
these matters, or we could work with
confidentiality regulations,’’ Burns
said. The SCC has no stipulations for
confidentiality similar to the Section O
of the EC handbook, which requires
that members of the EC say nothing
about honor investigations, Fricke
noted at the EC meeting.

“‘If (the ad hoc review committee)
had come to us and approached us
with problems we could have worked
on it together. We were told (by
Henry) that there was nothing we
could. do about it,’’ Burns said, who
wants to see the jurisdiction of sexual
and ethnic harassments return to the
SCC.

But the CRC was formulated speci-
fically with confidentiality to sensitive

 

about two weeks ago by President
John Wilson, EC President Christo-
pher DeMovellan said.

There are four women and two
blacks on the committee, Kozak said,
who stressed that the committee was
designed to equally represent all fac-
tions of the university. ‘‘I think people
have been chosen who can be objec-
tive and sensitive about the situations.
I personally don’t have a particular
principle that I want to espouse other
than justice.’’

Kozak added that he would like to
see the CRC act as a “‘last-resort
committee,’’ that would take cases
only if it were decided that counseling
or similar steps of action had proved
ineffective.

The CRC will not serve as a coun-
seling organization. One of the few
provisions that was given to the CRC
is that no one involved in the counsel-

ing process in the university may be a ~

member of the CRC. This prohibits
dorm counselors, resident assistants,
University Psychologist Dr. James
Worth and all other university coun-
seling staff from tn on ate commit-

*a

CRC: Debate continues

tee, Bray said. The point of the com-
mittee is only to allow for confidential
communications about sensitive sub-
jects, Bray said at the EC meeting.

David Burns countered the state-
ment saying that he ‘‘would hate to
see a lack of confidentiality and sen-
sitivity in the recent past as the only
points that take some power away
from the student-run campus.’’

Senior John Roach spoke out at the
EC meeting, calling the formation of
the CRC ‘‘One of the worst things that
has happened at W&L since I’ve been
here.’’ Roach said, ‘‘This committee
will stop being a committee of last re-
sorts, and turn into a law review.”’

Roach said that the unchecked facul-
ty power will lead to problems.
“‘When you give a committee ‘carte
blanche’ to move and investigate on
these things, you’re asking for
trouble,’’ he said. He added that ‘‘a
few swear words,’’ which are listed
under the law as sexual denigration,
can lead to a great deal more problems
than they mean at the time they are ut-
tered.’’ In closing, he said, ‘‘The stu-
dent control issue is of grave con-

.

cem.

The EC moved to form a small
committee to look into the options for
the CRC, including complete dissolu-
tion of the committee, or leaving the
committee as it is. EC members Dan
DuPre and John Fialcowitz will meet
with the SCC and members of the
CRC to consider alternatives.

A possibility that was mentioned at
the EC meeting was to change the
formation of the CRC to a student
majority. Kozak said that the CRC
was formed with a faculty majority to
maintain continuity and solidity within
the committee. Faculty members
would be relatively permanent mem-
bers of the CRC, and would be a solid
foundation, while students would
change each year. Kozak said he plans
to leave the CRC after the first year.

Currently, the CRC has no specitic
procedures, but will be able to issue
punishments from counseling to sus-
pension, Kozak said.

The EC committee will report its

findings at the next regular EC meet-
ing on Monday, Sept. 26.

Executive Committee:
budget hearings near

By Stacy L. Morrison
Staff Reporter

 

" After hearing a lengthy debate on
the newly formed Confidential Re-
view Committee (CRC), the Execu-
tive Committee announced the date
for budget hearings.

EC budget hearings will be held
Tuesday, Sept. 27, at 5:45. Approxi-
mately 25 campus organizations, from
Ariel to Trident, will present their
fequests for EC funding. Budget
request applications are due Monday,
Sept. 26, by noon.

’ Petitions for first-year law students
interested running for the EC
Monday

were

due Seven petitions were

received. Candidates are: Paul Dris-
coll, Josh VanHulst, Kerry D. Lee,
Mark A.Cobb, Rick Sorenson, Jimmy
Watts and Tom O’Brien. Also the
Dean of Students has requested that a
law student be appointed to the Stu-
dent Health Committee this year. The
Student Health Committee was for-
merly composed of faculty members
and three undergraduate students.
Senior Greg Dale withdrew his
request for EC funds for a student
voter registration drive. Dale had
planned to print up cards with the
telephone number of each  state’s
Board of Elections so students could
contact their election board to register
and/or request an absentee ballot

Dale withdrew his request because the
Ring-tum Phi agreed to publish the
phone numbers.

DeMovellan said that ‘‘after a great
deal of research,’’ the EC decided to
allocate a maximum of $4,000 toward
the purchase of new equipment of the
EC’s use. The EC will replace its pho-
tocopier and buy a new computer. The
Xerox 1012 copier will cost approxi-
mately $1,610; the Epson computer
and printer, $1,750. The EC voted
unanimously to purchase the above
equipment, which will be used to store
and process EC records, agendas-and
minutes,

All members were present and the
meeting lasted about two hours.

Charles F. Phillips Jr., Robert G.
Brown Professor of Economics at
Washington and Lee University, re-
cently published the second edition of
his textbook, The Regulation of Public
Utilities: Theory and Practice.

The first edition of The Regulation
of Public Utilities was published in
1984 and has served as a preferred
guide to public utilities in the Ameri-
can economy both as a classroom
textbook and as a reference work for
utility executives and regulators. The
book is also used extensively by law
firms, Phillips said.

In the second edition, Phillips re-
views and analyzes the development
of economic regulation, emphasizing
recent and future issues confronting
the public utility sector. The highly
acclaimed text also contains an up-
dated index of all of the significant
commission rulings and court de-
cisions regarding public utlities.

The idea for the book, according to
Phillips, grew out of the need for such
a text in his Economics 314 course,
Regulated Industries in the American
Economy.

Phillips said he was also influenced
by a course he teaches every summer
at the University of Michigan.

**It’s called the Public Utilities Exe-
cutive Program and it’s a four-week
course for middle managers,’’ Phillips
said,

Phillips has taught the course since
1970 and is a faculty member of that
program.

Phillips is a nationally known au-
thority in the field of government re-
gulated businesses and has testified as
an expert witness before federal agen-
cies and regulatory commissions. He
joined the Washington and Lee faculty
in 1959 and was named to the Brown
Professorship in 1980.

Phillips holds a bachelor’s degree
from the University of New Hamp
shire and a doctorate from Harvard.

Campus security guards and Lexington policemen writing parking tick-
ets have been a familiar sight since students have returned to school.

Tickets increase;
Parking decreases

 

By Nancy K. Whalen
Tri-editor

Washington and Lee on-campus
parking leaves somthing to be de-
sired... an available space.

According to Charles F. ‘‘Murph’’
Murray, director of security, the
school has issued 1,560 parking stick-
ers this year to faculty, staff and stu-
dents who will be parking on campus
during class hours. He also said that
his most recent count of W&L desig-
nated parking spaces was 1,051.
However, he concluded that that count
was before construction began on the
Performing Arts Center and Gaines
Hall, which took out three parking
areas.

Of the stickers issued according to
Murph, approximately 600 were is-
sued to faculty and staff, 374 to up-
perclass students living outside a one-
half mile radius of Washington Hall or
residential members of designated
fraternities, 274 to law students, 98 to
freshmen, 96 to residents of Woods
Creek, 91 to residents of Gaines Hall,
and 27 to dorm counselors. A $20 fee
was required from everyone register-
ing a car as listed above, with the ex-
ception of faculty and staff, and dorm
counselors.

There were also 274 stickers issued
to students living inside the one-half
mile radius of Washington Hall not

wanting to use campus parking.

Although the number of available
parking spaces has decreased, Murph
said the numbers of towings and tick-
ets given have increased in the past
few years.

Murph said stricter enforcement
came about at the request of Frank A.
Parsons, executive assistant to the
president, for one reason because the
grass in the corral or ‘‘snake pit’’ as
Murph called it, has become torn up.
He said W&L security guard Thomas
Bane’s primary job is to enforce the
parking regulations.

Adding to the problem, according to
Murph, is the use of W&L parking
during business hours, by some Lex-
ington business owners. He said at
least four business owners’ cars have
been towed from the corral this year.

He said the main problem is that
‘*no one wants to walk.’’ He said the
majority of the cars towed belong to
freshmen because they are breaking a
parking agreement they signed requir-
ing them to park out by Liberty Hall.

Murph said he has made some sug-
gestions to alleviate the parking prob-
lem, but as of yet, no plans have been
adopted. ‘‘It’s a problem,’’ he said,
**...it’s a problem.

IFC reports good rush

No serious problems arise

By Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

Interfraternity Council delegates at
Tuesday’s meeting were pleased to
learn good news about Rush in general
as well as good reports on last week-
end’s invitation parties.

Thus far, no freshmen have been
hospitalized or taken to the infirmary
due to overuse of alcohol, a relief

after considering that such instances
have been on a steady rise in the past
several years’ Rush activities.

Also, no serious problems were re-
ported regarding fraternity functions
during the weekend of Sept. 16-18.
Police remained on top of the situa-
tion, particularly as pertained to Sat-

urday’s invitation parties. Bands were
shut down shortly after midnight,
when the amplified noise permits offi-
cially ran out. Several houses,
however, have received citations for

unauthorized amplified sound during
the week — technically, permits are
only issued for Friday and Saturday
nights.

Reminders of the schedule for the
remaining days of Rush and the fol
lowing weeks were also given includ-
ing information on post-pledging acti-
vities as well as deferred Rush. A

period of no contact for non- pledges
will resume on Sunday evening for
most students and on Monday evening
for currently-active varsity athletes. If
a rushee has not pledged by this time,
he must wait until Oct. 7, when full

- considered ‘‘social members”’

contact resumes. This limitation will
not be placed on pledges, who are
of the
fraternity. ‘‘Cooling-off periods’’ will
also be enforced in the next few days,
including all day Thursday and Friday
between the Ist Rush Date and the be-

ginning of parties. The Judicial Board
commented that it consider s
breaching of these rules to be ‘one of
the biggest violations.’” Warnings

were also given regarding the proper
facilitation of Tear Night, which is
Friday, Sept. 23, and the pledge
ceremonies. Also, fraternities were
reminded that Saturday afternoon was
to be a period of ‘‘informal drop-ins at
the house only.’’ Delegates were also

reminded of the necessity in getting
their pledges to the 7:00 assembly at
Lee Chapel this coming Monday.

A proposal outlining a recycling
plan for the Lexington community
was presented by Professor Emmons
of the Biology Department. Through
the plan, the fraternities would vol-
unteer their time to support a center of

the collecting of recyclable glass
paper, aluminum, and other metals.
The center would be operated three

days a week for about eight hours a
day with the aid of fraternity vol-
unteers as an ongoing community ser-
vice project

At the close of the meeting, dele-
gates were reminded to use caution in
this weekend’s pledging activities so
that the past weekend’s good model
would be rem ad.

DRUGS,

Drugs, Drugs

The United States is plagued with citizens who continue to ex-
periment with devastating drugs like cough medicine and Elmer’s
Glue. Every single day, a well known athlete or computer analyst is
admitted to the Betty Ford Clinic for Famous Drug Abusers. Moti-
vated by First Lady drug expert Nancy Reagan, the Senate is plan-
ning to change the drinking age to 35.

In the middle of this drug controversy is the city of Lexington,
Virginia. The city which was once famous for the grave of General
Lee and his esteemed horse is now earning a reputation as a leader
in underage drinking convictions. The city recently won a Supreme
Court decision against a student who was found eating a chili-
cheese dog at 3 a.m. and arrested for public drunkenness. The ar-
resting officer correctly realized that he had enough probable cause
for a conviction. Lexington Police statistics for the 1988 year have
recently been released to the general public. The total number of
felony arests is second only to Detroit. Here are the exact figures: 0
felony arrests; 0 homicide arrests; 15,000 public drunkenness
arrests 32,000 underage drinking arrests.

In addition, Lexington issued 3 million speeding tickets, 14 mil-
lion parking tickets, and collected $600,000 worth of fines for noise

violations.

The W&L administration supports Lexington’s crackdown on
drugs, alcohol and noise and is doing its part to conform to the city.
To help in the ‘‘just say no to drugs’’ campaign, the University has
increased penalties for substance offenders. The students learned
about this general crackdown from a very well- written university
presidential letter they received this summer.

The position of colleges concerning drugs has changed drastically
in 20 years. It used to be that students went to college in order to
take drugs with administrators and professors. In 1968, a mere 20
years ago, the university president also sent home letters about
drugs to students. I obtained one of these letters for reprinting. Here

it is:

Dear students, The recent South American drought has ruined
their marijuana crop and market prices have escalated. Because the
administration is sensitive to the portion of the student body that
uses this drug, we will help those in need by subsidizing the impor-
tation of a very potent crop from the African nation of Morocco.

Peace brother,
Norman Groovis

Because I hope to someday win journalistic awards for important
commentary against drugs, I will take this opportunity to remind
students that they could die from the abuse of drugs, like arsenic.

.... and more

 

MY VIEW
By Robert J. Owen

 

On Tuesday, Sept. 13th, Chief
Beard informed the IFC that the past
weekend’s activities had left Lexing-
ton a ‘‘town out of control.’’ Of the 48
arrests made Saturday night, the vast
majority had been W&L students. In
addition to reminding the fraternities,
Beard also left a warning, ‘“We cannot
continue the way that we are going.”’
These words very accurately reflect
the current situation.

Comments by several students in
last week’s paper demonstrate that
many students may have missed the
point of Beard’s message. But we all
saw that he means business this past
weekend as the police moved to en-
force the law during last Saturday’s
Rush activities.

Some students may feel that Beard’s
actions constitute police harassment.
Others may feel that the administra-
tion is supposed to protect our right to
drink and party. Many more seem to
feel that W&L has no right to interfere
in a student’s private partying when it
is not a school function. Unfortun-
ately, these are not valid assumptions.

Those of you who feel that the
events of the past few weeks have

been police harassment may wish to
consider the following points.

Beard himself reminded the IFC of
the need for fraternities to obtain per-
mits before holding a weekend party.
Imagine the consequences if Beard
withheld permits for parties on Home-
coming, Alumni Weekend, Hal-
loween, Christmas and FANCY
DRESS. It’s even easier to shut down
week night parties. IFC by-laws
clearly state that music and general
noise levels should ‘‘never exceed the
noise ordinance requirements of Lex-
ington.’’ Now consider that it is the
city and police of Lexington who set
and enforce these standards. In short,
Chief Beard has been very reasonable
so far.

As for those students who feel that
the administration is not standing up
for our rights at W&L, consider this
for a moment. There is no written
rule, law or statute that gives us the
right to drink as W&L students. Parti-
cularly since probably 80 percent of
this campus is under the legal drinking
age of 21.

Finally, I respectfully remind the
students who feel that the administra-
tion has no right to interfere in our
non-academic social events that we
are ,. &L students. Because we live in
this community our actions reflect
upon us and our university. Thus the
administration does have a vested in-
terest in what we do. The old argu-

The dangerous direction of French politics —

 

MY VIEW
By Julia Kirk

 

The first time I talked with a mem-
ber of Le Front National I was told
that the leader of the movement, Jean
Marie Le Pen, was a Francist not a
fascist and that being a racist was
something of which to be proud. This
was but a few weeks after Le Pen had
stated publicly that the Holocaust was
a ‘detaile’ (detail). Even now it seems
impossible to me that intelligent edu-
cated people support the Front (FN)
and Le Pen. They do. In the first
round of Presidential elections Le Pen

drugs

ment of ‘‘boys will be boys’’ does not
work anymore. Nor does ‘‘I’m not re-
sponsible, I was drunk.’’ We are not
‘‘boys”’ or ‘‘girls’’ but ADULTS and
as such we are RESPONSIBLE FOR
OUR ACTIONS.

What do we do about this situation?
The answer is simple. The IFC needs
to take the initiative in policing and
supervising the fraternity system. No
matter how painful, the IFC must be
firm and the penalties more than a slap
on the wrist. This is infinitely more
preferable to the possible and proba-
bly future actions of Chief Beard. In-
deed, such a move by the IFC would
remove the necessity of action on
Beard’s part. Finally, this will return a
measure of independence to the IFC
which it has lost in recent years.

The future of parties at W&L lies in
the hands of the student body. Please,
let’s not blow the chance.

Code should have said, ‘‘If a student

script.”’

 

 

beat Mitterand in such key cities as
Marseilles and Nice.

The ever increasing popularity of
the far right in France is worrisome.
In 1981 the movement won only 1
percent of the vote and in 1988 — 14.4
percent. New FN voters are former
moderates, socialists and most espe-
cially former communists. Le Pen’s
nationalistic rhetoric and cries of
‘France for the French’ have created a
strong voter base 50 percent of which
stated that they voted for Le Pen
solely on the basis of his political pro-

On the surface, Le Pen’s program
does not seem terribly frightening. He
supports the death penalty, wishes to
battle drug use and violence, and

wants immigration and naturalization
laws rewritten. Given his virulent ra-
cism the last point would have a stag-
gering effect on the Arab population
in France. However, the most disturb-
ing part of his program is La Pref-
erence Francaise, a policy aimed at
helping French workers who have suf-
fered from competition by ‘foreign’
workers in the country.

France is the fourth largest in-
dustrial economy in the world, yet for
five weeks every year it grinds to a
halt while the population goes on va-
cation. One would be hard-pressed to
find a Frenchman willing to give up
his paid ‘vacances’ or admit that clos-

year might not be economically

sound. It is much easier to blame the
most highly visible minority, the
Arabs, for all the country’s problems. ,
Le Pen has had incredible success in
doing just that, and his popularity con-»
tinues to grow.

It is easily conceivable that the,
Front National might grow to encom-
pass up to 20 percent of the voting po-’
pulation. Under the French form of,
government such a percentage would
give Le Pen a huge amount of power. '
He would be able to influence dom-,
estic and foreign policy. With 1992
just around the corner, Le Pen could:
have a profound effect not only on

Western Europe, but on the United’
States as well. ‘

Brady Bunch redefines the ‘F’ word .

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

My continuing search for answers
in the Failure of Contemporary Re-
lationships between the sexes has
brought me to the inevitable
‘“‘F’’word. The emergence of fem-
inism in the 20th century is a key
component in this ongoing battle be-
tween men and women and therefore
must be fully comprehended.

To find out where and when the
feminist movement really started, I
consulted Dr. Lippendrip Bonehead,
P.H.D., in family life, famous for his
dissertation entitled, “‘Is Your Fami-
ly’s Alpha Dog a Bitch?’ He con-
sidered television to be the most im-
portant factor in the feminist move-
ment.

According to Dr. Bonehead, T.V.
was initially anti-feminist with pro-
grams like ‘*Leave It to Beaver”’ in
which Mrs. Cleaver wore dresses and
took orders from Dad, Wally and even

the Beaver. But then came ‘*The
Brady Bunch’’and that critical ep-
isode when the Brady females went on
a housework strike and realized that
playing baseball was more fun than
doing the dishes. At that point,
women all over the globe realized that
like the Brady women they too could
wear groovy bell bottom polyester
pants and play sports better than the
Brady boys who were obvious sissies.

Dr. Bonehead explained that men
probably would have adjusted to this
moderate Brady Bunch type of fem-
inism if it hadn’t evolved into an ultra
militant variation. In the interest of
journalistic compassion I decided to
see a militant feminist speciman
firsthand. After many strings were
pulled, I was finally granted an inter-
view with Melba ‘‘The Beast’’ San-
tini. Here are excerpts from the inter-
view:

Jon: So Melba, what exactly are you
militant feminists trying to accom-
plish?

Melba: First of all, we think that
women should fight in any wars over

the next 200 years to get even for any
fighting the men did for us. Secondly,
we hope to outlaw large breasts be-
cause they make construction workers
gawk and whistle which demeans
women. Naturally, we also believe
that make-up and dresses should be
banned. And our last and most impor-
tant wish is to censor nature programs
which sensationalize the fact that male
big horn sheep treat their females like
cow dung.

Jon: But male big horn sheep do
treat their females like cow dung.
Melba: That’s irrelevant.

Jon: Is it true that your advocate
chauvinocide — the torture and killng
of male chauvinists like Bugs Bunny?

Melba: Yes.

a

Jon: Do you use steroids?

Melba: My attorney has advised me ,
to ignore questions of that nature.

Before I finished interviewing Me- *
Iba she shared with me the exlusive,
Militant Feminist World Evil Chant:

1. Cheerleading
2. Hustler Pornography Magazine

3. The fact that men do not men-’
struate

4. The fact that men do not get’
pregnant

-

5. Mini-skirts ‘

6. The atom bomb, war, world hun- °
ger and cruelty to animals

‘

Has depression already set in with
the start of the school year? If so, the
Washington and Lee peer counselors
can help you break this melancholy.
According to Dr. James Worth, Uni-
versity Psychologist, the W&L peer
counselors are students trained in
listening skills to deal with problems
such as drug and alcohol abuse, sexua-
lly transmitted diseases, problem
pregnancy, and depression, to name a
The purpose of the program is to offer
students an alternative to the Washing-
ton and Lee professional counseling
staff.

A student can contact a peer counse-
lor by calling the ‘‘Hotline’’ or the
counselor’s residence. The Hotline
operates every night of the week and
the number of the Hotline and its
scheduled hours are listed. Dr. James
Worth states, ‘“The nice thing about
the Hotline is the student can call
anonymously.’

The student also has the option of
meeting face to face with a peer coun-
selor; however, the peer counselors
are not expected to have long-term
counseling sessions. According to
peer counselor Carrie Jennings,
‘Counselors are not supposed to go
beyond three face to face counseling
sessions, since at that time a profes-
sional would be of more help to the
student.’ If the student encounters a
problem different from the one
already discussed with the peer coun-
selor, then the student can again seek
the counselor for advice. Meredith
Walker, Head Peer Counselor, notes,
“I see the student-counselor sessions
as a one shot deal. If the student were
to keep coming back, I would recom-
mend him to the W&L professional
counseling staff or to an appropriate
agency or resource because these
alternatives could give the student
more help than I could.”’

All matters the peer counselor con-
fronts are strictly confidential with the
exception that Dr. Worth may be con-
sulted to assure the counselor he or
she has given good advice. Dr. Worth
notes, ‘‘I oversee the program and un-
less the student is dangerous to him-
self or other people, all material is
treated confidentially. Even among
the peer counselors, names are not

Sigma Chi receives award

 

By D. Street
Staff Reporter

The Sigma Chi Fraternity at Wash-
ington and Lee University recently
received the Legion of Honor Schol-
arship Award at Sigma Chi’s 41st an-
nual Leadership Workshop in Dekalb,
Il.

The Legion of Honor Award is gi-
ven annually to those campus chapters
selected as having commendable
scholarship programs, W&L’s Sigma
Chi Chapter was among 54 of the 207
active chapters honored for the
1987-88 academic year.

The delegates from W&L were
President Robert Tompkins, Vice
President David Emerich, Treasurer
Jeff Trussell, Pledge Trainer John
Perkins, and Rush Chairman Gary

McCullogh. The award was presented
to the chapter’s delegates at the work-
shop, where they were involved in
various lectures and discussions on
ideas and methods for successful chap-
ter operations, activities, and schol-
arship. The Sigma Chi workshop, the
largest in the Greek- letter world, is a
four-day program , which this year at-
tracted more than 1,300 student and
alumni leaders of the fraternity from
43 states and four Canadian prov-
inces.

Sigma Chi was founded in 1855 at
Miami University, Ohio, and is head-
quartered in Evanston, Ill. In addition
to its 207 undergraduate chapters, the
Sigma Chi Fraternity has 128 active
alumni groups and more than 156,000
living members, students and alumni.

Chief of Staff
Howard Baker

lectures at VMI

By Becky Reynolds
Staff Reporter

 

An effort must be made to find a
way for the world to live in peace in-
definitely, Sen. Howard Baker said
Thursday night, Sept. 15, in a lecture
at Virginia Military Institute

**You are the great asset. You are
the people who can invent a way to
live in peace forever,’ Baker said to
the corps of cadets in Cameron Hall.

Last night’s lecture was the fourth
in the H.B. Johnson Jr. 1926 Distin-
guished Leadership Lecture Series.
Gen. Sam S. Walker, Superintendent
of VMI, gave the opening remarks
and introduced the endower of the lec-
ture series, Mr. Belton Kleberg John-
son.

Baker, who received a standing ova-
tion at the beginning and end of his
lecture, began by saying he put his
dreams of becoming President of the
United States behind him to become
President Ronald Reagan’s Chief of
Staff in February 1987, because the
party really needed him. ‘‘I made that
choice gladly and I have no regrets,”’
Baker said.

Baker left his post as White House
chief of staff for family considerations
on July 1, 1988. ‘‘I took the summer
off and took the opportunity to think
about issues as a private citizen,”
Baker said.

Baker said that although he believes
the political system in our country is
exquisite, it must face challenges be-
cause these times are different than
any other. He said, ‘‘We possess the
power to incinerate every living crea-
ture on this planet. The biggest chal-
lenge is to live peaceably without a
nuclear exchange indefinitely.”’

Its a strange paradox,’’ Baker con-
tinued, ‘‘that the best way to avoid
war is to remain militarily strong. I
believe we (the U.S.) are strong.”

Baker said that this makes a contri-
bution to indefinite peace but the job is
far from over. ‘‘The nation’s ambition
is 100 percent elimination of nuclear
weapons — a strategic arms treaty
(START). Negotiations with countries
possessing nuclear arms must con-
tinue until Congress ratifies this
treaty,’’ Baker said.

“*Essentially I’m an optimist and I
believe we will survive,’’ Baker con-
cluded.

Baker, who served as Republican
Senator of Tennessee for 18 years and
was senate Majority Leader from
1981-1985, put in a plug for Republi-
can presidential candidate George
Bush and Reagan’s position in the
Iran/Contra hearings during question-
ing. ‘‘I am convinced that Ronald
Reagan did not know about the
Iran/Contra affair and it was conduc-

ted without his authority,”’ Baker
said.
About the series, Walker said,

‘This series has been most significant
to our mission at VMI — building
leaders. Mr. Johnson established this
endowment to stress leadership to
honor his father.

mer after he graduated, acting univer-
sity President John Elrod said.

Lt. Steve Crowder of the Lexington
Police Department said an antique
dealer contacted the Reeves Center
soon after he obtained the porcelains,
and center Director James W.
Whitehead then notified police.

Crowder refused to identify the
dealer and also declined to discuss
how the dealer obtained the artifacts.

Crowder said the porcelains have
been returned to the center.

Volleyball team
opens with bang

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

In its first-ever varsity competition,
the Washington and Lee women’s vol-
leyball team won the Randolph-
Macon Woman’s College Tournament
last Saturday in Lynchburg. Not a bad
way to start off a collegiate program.

‘“‘That’s a pretty fast out of the
blocks so I’m very happy,’’ said head
coach Susan Dittman. ‘I thought we
played well, and it was good to get
wins against those teams because
they’re the teams we have to beat in
the conference.”’

During the tournament, the Gen-
erals beat three Old Dominion Athle-
tic conference rivals. W&L opened
with a hard-fought 15-4, 10-15, 15-3
win over Hollins. The Generals then
breezed by Sweet Briar, 15-9, 15-9, to
gain a berth in the championship with
R-MWC. After dropping the first
match to the host school 12-15, W&L
stormed back to capture the next two
matches—15-6, 15-8—and the cham-
pionship.

‘*We were a little inconsistent, but I
attribute that to our inexperience,’’
said Dittman. ‘“We were having
trouble passing serve [attacking off
the opposition’s serve]. That’s proba-
bly one of our weaker areas. When we
blow a couple of those points, we get
down on ourselves and lose confi-
dence.’

Dittman said freshman Mena
McGowin turned in a strong perfor-
mance, leading the team in blocks and
attack percentage. The third-year head
coach (the team spent the past two
seasons as a developmental program)
also praised the play of sophomore

The women’s volleyball team shows some emotions Monday after receiving the plaque
for winning the Randolph-Macon Woman’s College tournament on Saturday.

Bridgewater are the teams to beat. As
for the remainder of the conference, it
remains to be seen as to how well the
Generals will fare. Schools such as
Lynchburg, Roanoke and Emory and

Henry are the programs that will pro-
vide stern tests for the squad.

Two matches are on the schedule
for the Generals this week. Today,
WA&L plays host to a tri-match with

Southern Seminary and Roanoke at 6
p.m. in the Warner Center. On Satur-
day, the Generals travel to Washing-
ton, D.C. for a tri-match with Catho-
lic and Bryn Mawr.

For one week, Student Pavilion was home sweet home

Question: What is one of the keys to
having a successful team?

Answer: Unity. Every good team
has it. Okay, the Chicago Bulls may
not have a lot of unity, but they’ve got
the next best thing. If you have Mi-
chael Jordan, you don’t need a lot of

* unity.

The Washington and Lee men’s
soccer team doesn’t have Michael
Jordan, so they’ll just have to settle
for unity. Head coach Rolf Piranian
wanted his team to have a great deal of
unity, so for a week before the arrival
of students to campus, the soccer team
lived in the Pavilion. Why?

‘‘We felt a lack of team unity in
years past. This yéar, the upperclass-
men,.and freshmen got to know each
other better because we were all living

in the Pavilion. The intent was to pull-

the team together. It worked,”’ said
Piranian. »-

Senior co-captain Mike Veliuona
felt the same way. ‘‘It gave us unity
right off the bat. In previous years, the
upperclassmen would come down a

day or two early, and the freshmen
came down later. That kind of held us
up during practice. This year, we had
unity right away. We all had the same
schedule. Things went much better,
and we knew everyone’s name, which
helped during practice.”’

Piranian thinks that the week spent
in the Pavilion has been a positive
force on the team’s performance on
the fields. ‘‘I think that the combina-
tion of the Pavilion and playing on a
new field has elevated the games of all
our players.”’

This season, the team has brand
new fields to play on, and they chris-
tened the new field with a 3-2 win on
Sunday over then 18th-ranked Johns
Hopkins. This game meant more to
the team than an ordinary home
opener.

‘*Last year, we played in Baltimore,
and we felt we didn’t get a fair
shake,’’ said Veliuona. ‘*They beat us
1-0, but we had two ‘goals called back
and played them pretty even after they
scored early on. We felt we were
robbed, and we wanted to prove that
we were a better team than they
were.”’

with a few injuries. One of the most
notable of those injured was junior
forward Ricky Silva.

Not to worry though. In steps soph-
omore David Gilmore. In his first
start, he scored twice in the first eight
minutes of the game. The first goal,
Gilmore’s first NCAA goal, was as-
sisted by junior Patrick Brown. The
assist gave Brown the school assist re-
cord,

Said senior co-captain Steve Udi-
cious, ‘‘Our starting eleven has been
together for a while, and we’ve gotten
solid play from the reserves, David
Gilmore had a great game Sunday in
his first start. He replaced Ricky Si-
lva, who was injured, and was tre-
mendous.”’ :

Freshman David Hooker’s goal late
in the first half made the score 3-1,
and, according to Veliuona, put the
game away. ‘‘The score was 3-2, but
they scored a goal with 1:30 left. For
all practical purposes, we won 3-1.”

Women’s soccer makes

 

By Mike Shady
Sports Editor

 

If there is such a thing as ‘‘victory
in defeat’, then the Washington and
Lee women’s soccer team came close
to accomplishing such a feat last Sat-
urday against Roanoke.

The Generals (1-2) lost 4-0 to the
Maroons on the new Liberty Hall
field. The scoreboard, however, did
not tell the entire story.

In the two games against Roan-
oke—the defending Old Dominion
Athletic Conference champions—a
year ago, W&L was outscored 15-2.
So, it is obvious that the Generals are
much more competitive with the top
tearhs in the conference this season.

**4-0 is a great game for us,”’ said
head coach Jan Hathorn. ‘‘The thing
that was the most satisfying for every-
body was that they had to work hard to
beat us. They really had to play soccer
to beat us. We weren’t necessarily a
pushover.”’

Hathorn praised the defense for its
outstanding play, especially goalie

of keeping their offense from start-
ing.”’ .

Also playing well was junior goalie
Jack Pringle, who often ranged from
the goal ‘to punch away potentially
troublesome balls.

Eariy Wednesday afternoon, Roan-
oke College scored two second half
goals, the last with 18 minutes left, to
come from behind to hand the Gen-
erals a 2-1 defeat in the ODAC opener
for both teams. The Generals’ lone
goal was scored by junior Scott Levitt
off an assist from Gilmore. The loss
left the Generals 2-1 on the young
season.

This year’s team is based around a
group of five seniors, who are playing
together now for a fourth year. Off the
field, they are friends, and on the
field... ‘‘As a group, we’re confident
of each other. We like to say that we
know what each other is going to do
during the game, but we have a pretty
good idea most of the time. I’m eonfi-
dent that the’seniors up front (J8hnny
Sarber and Jamie Urso] will score the
goals, and the seniors in the back
[Halpert and Udicious] will prevent
goals. I try to do my part in the middle
to control the game,”’ said Veliuona.

Sherri Brown. The sophomore made
several great saves that not only kept
Roanoke from scoring but also gave
the Generals all important momen-
tum.
‘Sherri Brown had an excellent
day,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘That’s the best
goaltending I’ve ever seen her play. I
think, because she came through with
some saves of shots that normally
might have scored or at least last year
might have scored, that got people
fired up.””

The Generals had some good chan-

ces to score but just could not capi-
talize. Junior Sarah Allen had a direct
kick on goal that just missed and, in
the last 15 seconds of the game, a
W&L breakaway also failed to con-
nect.
‘*The opportunities we had were so-
lid ones and they were legitimate,’’
said Hathorn. ‘‘We should have
scored on them but that’s the breaks of
the game and I don’t feel bad about it.
The fact that we did things correctly is
what’s important.”’

It doesn’t get any easier for the
Generals this week. Today, W&L

Said Urso, ‘‘For the most part, the
school is not really conducive to
sports. There’s not a lot of fan sup-
port, but the guys on the team and the
coaching staff have made playing
nowfor four years worthwhile.’’

Co-captains Udicious and Veliuona
feel that this year’s team could recap-
ture the ODAC title that it won in
1986. Both agree that this year’s team
has great potential, but they must be
wary. According to Udicious, ‘‘This
year we have the potential to be the
best team in my four years here. We
won the conference in 1986, and we’-
ve got the potential to do it again.
We’ ve just got to take it one step at a
time.”’

Veliuona said, ‘‘We have a really
good and mature team. The freshmen
have been filling in where we need
them. If we play to our capacity, we
could win the ODAC again.”’

He is also quick to warn, however,
that ‘‘this year there is not one team
that we can look past in the confer-
ence. Every team has the ability to
beat each other. We just have to play
to our capacity.”’

travels to Ashland to play Randolph-
Macon. The Yellow Jackets finished
second in the ODAC a year ago. On
Saturday morning at 11:30, things get
even more difficult when the Generals
face Marymount, the 10th-ranked
team in the nation in Division II.
Marymount barely beat Randolph-
Macon, 2-1, earlier in the year on a
goal scored in the closing seconds of
play.

“I expect we are going to have to
play with the same kind of intensity
and fight and drive as we did against
Roanoke,” said Hathorn. ‘‘Pretty
much for the next two weeks that’s the
way it’s going to have to be.”’

Hopefully, the Generals will be able
to maintain that level of intensity and
enthusiasm over a stretch of tough
games, something that the team had
trouble accomplishing last year.

‘*We're definitely learning how to
do that,’’ said Hathorn. ‘‘That’s a po-
sitive thing. There is not a game on
our schedule where we can ‘blow it
off’ in a sense, and not that anyone
would want that.”’

Polo tops
lona in

tournament

By Tom Wingfield
Staff Reporter

 

 

Washington and Lee’s water polo
team took a giant step towards becom-
ing one of the best teams in the East at
the Southeast Varsity Invitational in
Annapolis, Md., last weekend.
W&L’s impressive performance
against three of the top six teams in the
East has propelled the Generals into

the number four ranking.
W&L, ranked 19th in the nation en
tering the tournament, opened the

weekend by beating 18th-ranked Iona
9-8. The Generals never trailed in the
game and were led by senior David
Reavy’s three goals. This victory over
Iona not only assured W&L of finish-
ing among the top four teams in the
East, but marked the first time in
W&L history that the water polo team
has beaten Iona.

The Generals’ semifinal game was
against the number one team in the
East and 10th-best team in the country
— Brown. The Generals, who may
have suffered an emotional letdown
after such a big victory, started the
contest a little flat and fell behind
early. The score was 7-1 Brown after
the first half, but the Generals fought
back, making the game close before
losing 11- 8. Despite the loss, head
coach Page Remillard was far from
discouraged. ‘‘My experience in
water polo, international or national,
has shown me that when two teams are
separated by only three goals, they
can play again two hours later and the
other team could win,”’ he said.

W&L’s third game was played
against 17th-ranked Bucknell, who
had lost to Navy in the other semi-
final game. The Generals could never
gain the lead as they seemed to be hurt
most by a week transition game.
Senior David Dietz, who scored seven
goals against Brown and five versus
Bucknell, said, ‘‘We should have bea-
ten Bucknell but our counter-attack
defense hurt us. Otherwise, though,
we played very well against set
offenses all weekend.”’

Remillard was very excited about
the performance of his team and was
very much looking forward to going
to the Northeast Varsity Invitational at
Brown in two weeks.

‘*This team has accomplished more
than any other team in W&L history
already this season,’’ said Remillard.
‘*We’re playing water polo at an elite
level. This team believes in itself.
They know what they can accom-
plish.”’

Dietz and Reavy both agreed that
this past weekend has proven some-
thing to the team.

‘‘We can beat anyone in the East.
Any of the top four teams could win
the Eastern championships,” said
Dietz.

Cross country
ready to run

 

From Staff Reports

 

The Washington and Lee men’s and
women’s cross country teams open
their 1988 seasons Saturday in Lex-
ington, and both teams expect to be
competitive for Old Dominion Athle-
tic Conference championships.

Both teams start their campaigns
against non-conference foe Mary
Washington on the W&L course on
Saturday. The men start at 11 a.m.,
and the women’s race is set to follow
at 11:45.

Men’s head coach Dick Miller is
taking a realistic approach to his 36th
season

‘*We'’ll take them one at a time,’ he
said. ‘‘That’s the only way we can do
it. I don’t think we'll be nearly as
strong as we've been since we lost
some very good seniors. You can’t
replace them.”’

The men recorded their
10th-straight winning season last year
behind the leadership of veterans Rich
Norris and Scott Rippeon. If there is
to be an Ilth, it will have to come
from this year’s new leaders, Bill
Clark and John Deighan, the W&L
senior co-captains.

Meanwhile, the women have
several veterans to help their cause in
*88. Leading the way last year was
Paige Cason, who captured ODAC
Runner-of-the-Year honors and fin-
ished 17th at the regional. Cason set a
new course record each time she ran
the W&L course last season.

Senior captains Stephanie Smith and
Kim Eadie should provide plenty of
leadership, and some new talent could
push the women to their most success-

ful season in history
‘‘Every year, we've taken some
very positive steps, and that’s been

very encouraging,
Jim Phemister.

said head coach

New Progressive
show on WLUR

 

By Greg Ossi
staff reporter

 

New to this year’s format is the
show Future History. It is a look at
some of the older progressive bands
and their music. Bands such as REM,
Cactus World News, Chameleons,
and Replacements, will be featured
along with Hereshot Similar bands.
This show was created in an effort to
get more rock air time and allow more
new bands air play on the break
through show.

The group that seems to be the
summer hit all over the college chart
and WLUR is the Sugarcubes. Their
album combines innovative rhythm
and haunting vocals in a very catching
way.

Big Audio Dynamite has a new one
out. The music is tight, fast and sub-
santive. If you like B.A.D., you will
love the album. It you've never heard
of them, definitely check this album
out. The name is ‘Tighten Up, Vol.
’88’’ and some good cuts include
‘*Esquerita”’ and ‘‘Champagne.”’

If you’re a fan of the Smiths, you
will be happy to know that they have
released a love album, entitled
‘*Rank.’’ This album features mostly
cuts off the ‘‘Queen Is Dead’’ and is
very hot.

One of the most exciting late sum-
mer/early fall releases is a compila-
tion album of Joy Division. Formed in
1977 and lasting until 1980 when the
lead singer, Ian Curtis, killed himself,
they were part of the start of progres-
sive music. Of course, the death of
Joy Division gave birth to New Order,
another progressive band. This album
is a must for those fans of Joy Div-
ision, as it is relatively hard to get this
music because most of it is imported
from England.

Other releases to smile about in-
clude The Feelies, James Shriekback,
Close Lobsters, Primitives, The Bible
and a release of Early Love and Rock-
ets.

Next week look for Stanley Jordan
playing ‘‘Stairway to Heaven,”’ Billy
Bragg’s latest and an update on U2’s
release of a single from the
album/movie *‘Rattle and Hum.”’
