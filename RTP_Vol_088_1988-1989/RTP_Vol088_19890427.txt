In his first meeting as the new Interfraternity
Council president, Kevin Nash stated that improving
relations with the faculty and with the Lexington
community would be one of the major focuses of
the IFC next year,

Nash also said other goals of the IFC will
include drawing up and passing a good rush
calendar, making sure all fraternities understand
Clearly the rules for next fall’s rush and completing
a new rush book by the end of this school year.

Other long-term goals mentioned by Nash
included encouraging better scholarship within the
W&L fraternity system, working to make the
fraternity renaissance program a success, working
closer with the sororities in order to, ‘‘make their
transition ino the W&L Greek system as smooth as
possible,’’ a.d possibly sponsoring a Greek Week
next fall.

Nash stressed the importance of fratemity
involvement in more social service projects, and of
obtaining better publicity for projects that fraternities
are already involved in. He said these goals are two
of the keys to better relations with the faculty and
the community.

Already the IFC is encouraging fraternity
participation in at least three upcoming charity
events. The first event will be a jump rope contest
tomorrow. On Sunday, the March of Dimes is
sponsoring a walk-a-thon and the IFC is requiring at
least two brothers front each fraternity to participate.
The third event, scheduled for May 15, is the IFC-
sponsored golf tournament. Fraternities will donate
$100 to $120 to enter four-man teams. The money
raised from the tournament will go to the American
Cancer Society.

Nash said that maintaining programs such as
this year’s police dinner program will be important
in keeping up good community relations. That
program has brought local police officers to each
fraternity house in order to answer questions and tell

‘The Lord’ to hang up
whistle after 41 years

By Scott Richardson
Staff Reporter

 

This is the last year Wash-
ington and Lee University students
will have the unique opportunity
to experience the euphoria of run-
ning with The Lord.

Coach Norman F. Lord, know
to his colleagues as ‘‘Stormin’
Norman,’’ has reached the manda-
tory retirement age of 70. He
will hang up his whistle after 41
years of spirited service to Wash-
ington and Lee.

“IT believe in sweat and
movement,’ says Lord, who
seems in better shape than many
of his students and is hardly ready
to retire. A farm boy from. Dela-
ware and a football player at
heart, Lord played football at the
University of Delaware and was
also a track and field man for the
Blue Hens.

Always on the move, Coach
Lord, known affectionately by the

student body simply as ‘‘The
Lord,’’ teaches 24 classes a week.
“IT can’t stand to see a person

walk,”’ he says.

In his gray, windowless office
on the 200 level of the Warner
Center, Lord, in a white hat,
W&L polo shirt, sneakers, khakis
and wearing his ever-present whis-
tle, laughs robustly with a shining
smile. He is tanned, fit and has a
commanding presence. He calls
physical education ‘‘the labor of
my love.”’

Lord majored in education to
be a science teacher, but World
War II changed his plans. As the
draft thinned out Delaware’s facul-
ty, Lord, who was not drafted un-
til 1943, became director of intra-
mural sports, a receiver coach in
football, freshman basketball
coach, assistant track and _ field
coach and began teaching physical
education.

Finally drafted in February,
1943, Lord went to Army Officer
Candidate School and volunteered
for the 11th Airborne in World
War II. He also served in Korea
from 1950 until 1952.

Lord came to Washington and

Track may get facelift this summer

 

By Cecily Tynan
Staff Reporter

Washington and Lee University’s track at
Wilson Stadium may get a face-lift this sum-
mer, if the Board of Trustees approves the
Athletic Department’s request for the construc-
tion of a new, all-weather track.

The board is scheduled to meet May 18-20
to review capital project proposals, including
the fourth consecutive request for the resur-
facing of W&L’s current cinder track,

Director of Athletics William D. McHenry
said, ‘“‘If it is approved {by the Board], we’d
like to have it under construction before June
1 and finished by August 1.’’

One week ago, an architect and a construc-
tion engineer visited W&L to study the stadi-
um and draw up a plan for the new track,
according to McHenry.

“I’m expecting to receive a written esti-
mate of expenditures by May 1. At that time
we will meet with President Wilson,’’ McHen-
ry said.

President John D. Wilson will make a

Graduate

recommendation to the board on whether or
not to accept the proposal after meeting with
the Athletic Department.

“The president is well aware. of our
needs. It will benefit not only track runners,
but the student body in general. A lot of peo-
ple like to jog,’’ said McHenry.

The board has rejected the track request
for the past three years.

Wilson said, “It’s a major expenditure on
the capital budget side and we’ve had to order
our priorities within the constraints of our
budget.”

“‘Also, we’ve been hoping to attract a
major private gift to offset part of the fund-
ing, but we haven’t been successful so far,”
he said.

Wilson said the proposal has a much bet-
ter chance of being accepted this year than in
the past.

“I’m not even entirely pessimistic that we
can’t get help from a private donor before the
board meeting in May,’’ said Wilson.

The main problem with W&L’s cinder
track is that water stands on it when it rains,
according to Norris T. Aldridge, coach of the

  

    

W&L men’s Track and Field Team and Asso-
ciate Professor of Physical Education.

““You can’t run on the track when it
rains,”” he said.

Wilson Stadium has not hosted any large
track invitationals recently since it is more
practical to schedule meets on all-weather
tracks, which are operable in the rain.

““We would have had ODAC’s here if we
had an all-weather track. But you’re taking a
chance [on rain] if you don’t have an all--
weather track,’’ Aldridge said.

The proposed six-lane track would be
made of latex material, similar to the surface
of the track at Virginia Military Institute’s
Alumni Field, and would require substantially
less upkeep than the current track, which
needs frequent raking, lining, and replacement
of cinders,

“Occasionally you will have to touch up
the lines, which are painted on the surface.
Every 6-8 years it will have to be resurfaced,
it depends on the amount of wear and tear it
receives... the upkeep is minimal. There is no
comparision to the upkeep required for a cin-
der track,’’ said McHenry.

Magazine seeks EC funds

to fly in
Shuttle

By Melinda Conkling
Staff Reporter

 

When the space shuttle takes
off from Kennedy Space Center in
Florida this November, David
Lowe, a 1978 graduate of Wash-
ington and Lee, will be part of the
five-man crew aboard.

Lowe, a physics and engineer-
ing major who also studied at
Cornell and Stanford, said that
he’s ‘‘extremely excited’’ about
the trip.

The shuttle weighs 4.5 million
pounds and travels at a speed of
17,500 miles per hour. Novem-
ber’s trip will last ten days, one
of the longest trips yet taken by
the shuttle.

On the first day in space, 190
miles above the earth’s surface,
the shuttle will deploy a communi-
cations satellite. After that, the
shuttle will rendezvous with and
retrieve a scientific satellite which
has been in orbit for five years,
The shuttle has a mechanical arm
that will ‘‘grab’’ the satellite and
place it on board the shuttle.
Some voyage time will be spent
doing medical experiments.

Lowe said that a common mis-
conception surrounding the space
shuttle missions is the supposed
aura of secrecy. Of the 28 mis-
sions completed, he said only
three have been under Department
of Defense secrecy,

A new student publication, vot-
ing regulations, an honor system
video and Evans Dining Hall dish
disappearances were the main top-
ics of discussion at the Monday,
April 24 meeting of the Executive
Committee.

The W&L Spectator, a new
student publication, will hit the
Colonnade with its first issue in
early May of this year. The Spec-

lator was presented as a news
magazine composed of in-depth
research and analysis of current
events. Paul Lagarde, Ray Welder
and Claude Williams, along with a
staff of writers, are seeking to
provide a forum for ‘‘enlightened
discourse’’ on ideas and issues
involving W&L, as well as current
national and international events.
An interview with John Warner
and Associate Dean of Students
Buddy Atkins are among the arti-
cles to be included in the May

issue, Lagarde stated that it was
their intention that the publication
not be characterized as anti-admin-
istration or solely a voice of con-
servative students at W&L.

Welder headed the group’s pe-
tition for $700 by the end of this
week to cover the cost of printing
the May issue. EC members rec-
ognized the merit of the new pub-
lication, but President Christopher
deMovellan stated that the ‘‘provi-
sional approval’ the Publications

Standing up| Paemmmemeeess Fs |
for a wrong?

By Dan Bettendorf

I am writing concerning the editorial
printed last week with the title ‘‘Freedom fails
without action.”” Miss Parkins seems to be
extolling protesting for its own sake instead of
the right to protest. She remarks that she did
not ‘understand’ the protests of the 60s at the
time; this is, of course, not surprising since
she was only a three-year-old child. My com-
plaint is, however, that she does not seem to
understand them now either.

In the 1960s people were ostensibly pro-
testing against government actions which
seemed ‘‘immoral.’’ They were doing some
thinking before they went out to wave ban-
ners. They were, I believe, protesting against
ideas such as killing people for purely politi-
cal reasons.

I wonder if Miss Parkins is fully aware of
what she was ‘“‘standing up and _ being
counted’’ for. I do not think I need remind
her that there are many who believe that un-
born fetuses have rights that must be defended
and are not a matter of a woman regulating
her own body so that she has the ‘‘opportuni-
ty to make [her] way successfully in life.’’

What I am questioning here is the judi-
ciousness of Miss Parkins’ decision to ‘‘revel
in’’ this liberty in this particular context. She
is quite right that the issue of abortion is a

Women have the opportunity to make re- —

A new track
finally (maybe)

As the story on page one of this week’s Phi indicates, the
W&L track program may finally be about to leave the 1920s.
According to President John Wilson, the chances that Wilson
Field’s track will finally be re-surfaced have never been

better.

That the track need re-surfacing is unquestionable. Standing
water remains on the track for days after a heavy rain; during
last fall’s Parents’ Weekend football game, the track looked

more like a moat or a cistern than a running surface.

Phi contained two articles that caught my
attention, namely ‘‘Is anybody out there lis-
tening’’ and ‘‘Freedom fails without action.’’
Well, as a Washington and Lee woman I was
listening, and decided to take action.

I was raised in the midst of political con-
troversy. My family has always been active

volatile one. The problem is that people are
assembling for some highly questionable rea-
sons. They want to maintain a ‘‘right’’ to
terminate pregnancies (a pro-choice euph-
emism for ‘‘abort fetuses’). I have never

 

I hope that this article has challenged you, ‘

as students at Washington and Lee to really

and read material that is printed by all sides. °

concerning issues in which they held strong
beliefs, but I was unwilling to let them simply
hand me the proverbial torch. I am a ‘‘Curi-
ous George’’ and always asked lots of ques-
tions. I have read books and articles, attended
lectures, and have been determined to under-
stand all sides of various issues because I
wanted my views to be precisely that -- my
views.

I have been active in the pro-life move-
ment for years, and there are millions of re-
sponsible women in this country who. stand
with me. Pro-life is very important to us, and
it means fighting for the one thing that all hu-
man beings have in common: life.

Let me suggest some food for thought.
When your sister or best friend gets pregnant,
you will not say ‘‘Jane is carrying an inani-
mate object that will turn into a life when it
is born!’ Rather you would say, ‘‘Jane is
going to have a baby!’’ Marches and protests
and letters are irrelevant when you consider
whether or not an unborn baby is a life. That

Despite practicing and competing on one of the slowest
surfaces imaginable, the W&L men’s track team has, with the
exception of men’s tennis, easily been W&L’s most successful
sport for decades. The Generals came within four points of
winning their fourth outdoor title since 1984 Saturday. Since
1950, the Generals have recorded 22 winning seasons. They
have not lost a dual meet since 1983, when they were a
disappointing (by their standards) 5-1. Norris Aldridge is one
of the most successful coaches W&L has ever known in any
sport. And the women’s team,. young as itis, is; already
showing signs of excellence.

Of course, as Athletic Director William McHenry points
out, the track at Wilson Field, when not under water, is used
by many members of the W&L community not on the track
and field teams. Students and faculty members should have
access to a useable outdoor track facility every day -- not just
when it hasn’t rained in the past week.

Wilson told The Phi he is ‘‘not entirely pessimistic that we
can’t get help from a private donor’’ to pay for the re-
surfacing. To us, that sounds like his little way of saying a
major donation may soon be announced. But, even if it isn’t,
we hope underclassmen will return in September to find a
new running surface on Wilson Field. And we hope the Board

No one claims that abortion
is morally good. Yet moral

consistency is exactly what
the better protestors of the
1960s demanded.

heard an argument yet which even attempts to
justify abortion in an ethical context. No one
dares claim that abortion is in any way moral-
ly good. And justifications and moral consis-
tency are exactly what the better protestors of
the 1960s demanded. This is the grand differ-
ence between the march on April 9 and the
protests of the period: then people were at
least making claims to intelligent thought, now
we simply raise our voices and chant the lat-
est phrases that have crossed our paths.

So I ask those who share this notion of
standing up for ‘‘something’’ to consider why
the pro-choice people are so contemptuous of
those who black abortion clinics. Pro-choice
advocates have a tendency to assume these
people are right-wing fundamentalists with no
intelligence whatsoever. In this respect they
are sadly incorrect. Consider, Miss Parkins,

to risk success for justice.

Once again, I am not at all convinced that

Unborn children possess detectable heartbeats

after conception. Babies being aborted also
react with movement to the abortion, as dem-
onstrated in Dr. Bernard Nathanson’s ultrason-
ic view of an actual abortion, ‘‘The Silent

sess very human physical features. They have

arms, legs, feet and a distinctively human ,

Bell says bye

To the Editors:

I would not like to leave without saying how much I have
appreciated being part of the faculty of W&L. I enjoyed my
students. They were so enthusiastic and bright. This river of
youth is the most important force flowing through a university. I
wish them luck and wisdom in the future. I also wish to thank my
colleagues in the art department....Professors Larry Stene and
Kathleen Olson for their time and support in organizing and helping
to put up my show, to Betty Hickox for her efficiency and good
nature, to Professor Margaret Brower for her collaboration and
continued enthusiasm for joint work, to Professor Gordon for his
assistance and liason, and to Dean Simpson for everything!

To the Editors:

The members of the Judicial Board of the I.F.C. would like to
inform the student body of a recent proposal submitted to the
Student Affairs Committee. The proposal is that a panhellenic
member be added to S.A.C. as well as the addition of another
faculty member to balance out the committee at six students and
six faculty members. We do not doubt the legitimacy of a
panhellenic vote on S.A.C.; however, we, the LF.C. Judicial Board
members, are opposed to the reduction in the effectiveness of our

vote on this committee resulting from this proposal. Any other
proposal pointing to a similar end we find equally unacceptable,
because, we believe, any reduction in our voting power is an
affront to the nearly 800 fraternity members we, and our one vote
on S.A.C., directly represent. We believe that the fratemity vote
should be indicative of our responsibilities that extend throughout
the W&L community. We felt that the student body needed to be
aware of this matter concerning student affairs and our opinion on
the subject.

On behalf of Alpha Phi Omega I would like to thank all those
who helped us in this year’s OxFam America campaign against
world hunger. Although we were not quite as successful this year
as last, we did raise around $600 which will go to disaster relief in
Third World nations and long term self-development programs.

I wold like to extend a special thanks to those freshmen who
thoughtfully sacrificed their meals, and I hope that it was an
educational and enlightening effort. As always, this could not have
been accomplished without the support of Jerry Darrell and the

An inside view of Harris Teeter...
Was it really a plot to destroy Kroger? Ask Jon Sbar.

Sbar’s View:
History lesson - Teeter v. Kroger

 

By Jon Sbar

 

Right now, Lexington isn’t one
of America’s biggest cities, but it
has potential. According to a few
economist mental patients from the
Betty Ford Clinic for Famous
Drug Abusers, by the year 1999
Lexington will have all the advan-
tages of a metropolis -- a public
transit system, art galleries, opera
houses, insane taxi drivers, gang
violence, pollution and maybe
even a Betty Ford Clinic for Fa-
mous Drug Abusers.

The Betty Ford Economists,
who are very qualified (they took
economics in high school), have
the world-renowned GSG
(grocery store growth) method in
formulating their Lexington predic-
tions. The GSG method is predi-
cted..on the assumption that a: po-
pulation boom in a small city
starts with grocery stores. What
the study amounts to, in technical
terms, is this: | Lexington has
more grocery stores that Boston
has, so in ten years (1999), Lex-
ington will be bigger than Boston.

By this time rational readers
should be wondering where this
article is going. Even irrational
readers should be wondering
where this article is going. In
fact, I’m wondering where this
article is going. According to my
editors, this article should be go-
ing to Kroger and Harris Teeter
for a humorous comparison of
these two powerhouse supermar-
kets. Because I am a veteran gro-
cery shopper, I was the natural
pick for the assignment.

But before we get inside a gro-
cery store let me take the reader
on a little journey back in time.

 

"Tsidra"

under his window,

 

 

Disturbing Professor Futch’s
"Popes" class by running around
and jumping on other dogs right

It all started in 1959 on Generic
Avenue in a small town some-
where in the United States with a
12-year-old boy named Harris
“‘the Milquetoast’’ Teeter. Harris
was happy making good grades in
school and watching public televi-
sion. He hated sports and spent a
lot of time by himself.

Three houses down the street
from Harris lived Butch ‘‘the Og-
re’’ Kroger, the neighborhood bul-
ly. Butch’s hobbies were vandal-
ism and fist fights. On a cold
day in November, Butch saw Har-
ris, who was returning home from
clarinet lessons. After a few de-
rogatory comments Butch smashed
Harris’s glasses and stole his clari-

net. As Harris walked home
trembling from Butch’s attack, he
vowed that one day he would get
even with Butch, even if it took
him until the 1980s. When Harris
learned that Butch was making a
fortune in Lexington, Va. with a
grocery store named Kroger, he
decided to open a competing gro-
cery store and put Butch out of
business.

As I walked into Harris Teeter
(the store) disguised as a shopper
I expected it to look something
like Kroger. Besides the fact that
it has food, Harris Teeter is noth-
ing like Kroger. Blue and pink
pastel colored walls and neon
signs directing you to the bakery,
the deli, the wine center or the
parking lot is something you ex-
pect from ‘‘Miami Vice,’’ not a
grocery store. Harris Teeter sells
more flowers than a greenhouse
and the aisles were filled with po-
lite little notices of apology like
this one: ‘*Due to Manufacturer

Early June Peas you’d probably
get thrown out.

Harris Teeter sells magazines
like Southern Bride, Hairstyle and
Organic Gardening, while Kroger
is dominated by Vietnam Combat,
Guns and Ammo and Combat
Arms. At Kroger there are long
aisles of equal length; at Harris
Teeter there are vertical, horizontal
and diagonal aisles and a seafood
rotunda.

The most memorable _ thing
about Harris Teeter is its catchy
jingle, ‘‘The Only Low-Price Su-
permarket that Refuses to Act
Like One.’’ Rumor has it that
they almost went with ‘‘I Eat,
Therefore I Shop at Harris Tee-
ter.”

Be careful when you are put-
ting your groceries into your car
at Harris Teeter. The parking lot
is on a hill. As I unlocked my
truck I noticed that my shopping
cart was wheeling away at an in-
credible velocity headed for a
group of innocent women and
children. Luckily, an HT bagboy
trained to handle runaway shop-
ping carts was there to prevent
what could have been a disaster.

Despite the many advantages of
shopping at Harris Teeter (such as
bagboys trained to stop runaway
shopping carts), don’t forget about

your old friend, Kroger. I know I
was thankful for Kroger on that
cold November night at 3:30 a.m.
when I was suddenly overpowered
by a desire to eat four blueberry
muffins. You have to appreciate
a grocery store that is open 24
hours a day.

While I think it’s great that
Lexington has so many grocery

Children born months prematurely
are given cutting edge medical
technology, and often survive to
become normal children, Clearly,
the child in the womb is not sim-
ply a ‘‘glob of cells’? as many
pro-choice advocates relate to the
public, since the child aborted at
ten to twelve weeks (the period of
development in which most abor-
tions occur) can feel pain, react to
stimuli, and be successfully surgi-
cally treated.

pro-choice position is that ‘‘wom-
en have the right to choose what
they will do with their bodies.”’
While | certainly believe in per-
sonal liberty, we must draw the
line on personal freedom when it
infringes upon the rights of others.
This is exactly what abortion does:
anyway you look at it, a life is
taken in abortion. In our socicty
of convenience and disposability,
the inconvenience of an unwanted
pregnancy is answered 4000 times
each day with the termination of a
life. Two lives, not one, are at
stake during pregnancy.

I cannot deny the fact that the
problems faced by a woman carry-

child are multiple. However, the
extinguishing of a life in a most
brutal manner cannot be the an-
swer to an inconvenience. Allter-
natives to abortion exist, and
many agencies are available to
help women who are dealing with
a crisis pregnancy. We as a soci-
ely must replace the ‘‘quick fix’’
of abortion with compassion, sup-
port, and real help to those re-
sponsible for a new life. The na-
tional scandal of an ‘‘easy’’ solu-
tion of murder in an unwanted
pregnancy glares shamefully on
our nation. It is time the facts
concerning abortion were widely
disseminated and the carnage stop-

Lee in 1946 as director of intra-
mural sports and assistant profes-
sor of P.E. Since then he has
served as a coach for varsity soc-
cer, track and field and cross
country and freshman wrestling.
He has also been an assistant bas-
ketball coach and the business
manager of athletics.

He has seen many changes in
his years at W&L and still has
strong feelings about the cheating
scandal of the early 1950s that led
to the de-subsidization of varsity
sports.

“The cheating involved many
Students outside the football
team,’’ he said. Students had ob-

tained and were selling exams.
‘‘One of the ring-leaders of the
scandal was a non-athlete,’’ he
said.

‘*Every one of those kids who
graduated under subsidization has
been successful,”’ he said.

A runner, Lord has hit the
pavement, so to speak, all over
the world. ‘I’ve run on a hotel
roof in Tokyo, in a strawberry
patch in Oslo, on the Olympic
track in Stockholm, in a cemetery

Rico and in a parking lot in De-
troit,’’ he said.

“There is nothing like a good

the runner’s high. Lord has a
special workout to help his
charges in P.E. 154, Aerobic Run-

ning. Three sets of chin-ups to the
point of failure followed immedi-
ately by a 12-minute run, then 25
push-ups and sit-ups, 20 laps in

To dry off, he likes students to

Ask anyone on the campus of
W&L about Coach Lord. The re-

will invariably be, ‘‘He’s amaz-

have that much zest and zeal for
life when I’m 70 years old.”’

Outing Club branches out

 

By Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

 

A new branch of the Outing
Club recently formed to protect,
conserve, and maintain the envi-
ronment. Under the direction of
Kirk Follo, those interested dis-
cussed immediate plans to recycle
aluminum cans, computer paper
and other paper.

The InterFraternity Council ag-
reed to require all fraternities to
gather recyclable aluminum cans.
Members will begin _collectin

cans from fraternities on Tuesday
mornings at 10 a.m. in the Outing
Club’s van. The W&L community
can help by using the separate
trash cans designated for recycle-
able aluminum cans and paper that
will be placed in academic build-
ings and dormitories.

Recycling cans is only one
way to help reduce waste and pol-
lution. The club’s plans for the
near future include an Environ-
mental Awareness Day and the
maintenance of trails on House

There will soon be "Save
House Mountain" T-shirts on sale
in the Bookstore and Co-op. The
money raised by the sales will
support Lexington’s effort to save
House Mountain from being sold
to the town. In addition, four local
bands have expressed an interest
in a spring concert for the sake of
environmental conservation, and
last weekend Sigma Nu donated a
vanload of aluminum.

EC...

 

(continued from page 1)

Board granted to the Spectator
blocks the EC from releasing fun-
ds. The EC can release funds to a
student publication only after it
has received an unconditional ap-
proval from the Publications
Board.

De Movellan suggested two
courses of action. Either the Publi-
cations Board could delay a final
approval of the magazine and re-
lease funds to the Spectator from
its own- account or the board
could approve the magazine and
the EC could create an account
for the Spectator. Time became an
issue, as the magazine organizers
stated that they needed the money
this week. De Movellan  sug-
gested that the board and the EC
will hold special meetings to make

publication possible.

At the meeting EC members
also discussed extending voting
hours for student body elections.
Third year law rep. Dave Nave
proposed that hours be extended to

reflect the class schedule, from 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. Currently, polls are
open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and in
the most recent Big Three elect-
ion, 68 percent of the student
body voted. Senior EC Rep. John
McDonough further proposed that
hours be extended into the night.

De Movellan opposed extending
hours into the night. He stated that
students who were concerned
about voting should be able to get
on campus within a 10-hour peri-
od and vote. In addition de Move-
llan pointed out that nighttime vot-
ing hours would substantially de-
lay the tabulation of results. The
EC voted to approve extending
voting hours on all elections, so

until 6 p.m.
In other EC business, McDon-

ough and Alston Parker reported
on a video the EC is producing to
introduce honor system to prospec-
tive students, the freshman class
and new faculty members. A
script has been finalized, based on
a skit between students debating
on whether or not to cheat on ex-
am. McDonough reported that a
budget of $6500 was needed to
produce the video.

EC members also discussed a
request from the management at
Evans Dining Hall conceming EC
action to curb the theft of dishes
and utensils by student patrons.
Sophomore Rep. Willard Dumas
pointed out that the EC must de-
termine whether a student should
be dismissed from W&L for tak-
ing a dining hall fork. Members
voted to appoint Junior Rep. Bran-
don Canaday to look further into

the release of funds and on time that polls are open from 8 a.m. the matter.

Women’s lax

trips Hollins

‘said Hathorn.

 

By Amy Packard
Staff Reporter

 

Janine Hathorn, head coach of
the Washington and Lee women’s
‘lacrosse team, was understandably
‘In a good mood last night. Her
‘description of W&L’s first-round
‘Old Dominion Athletic Conference
tournament game against arch-rival

‘Hollins College was overflowing
_ .with strong adjectives.

’

“It was an awesome game,”
“The whole team
played beautiful defense. The
scoring, too, was key and well

",done.”’

W&L beat Hollins 7-5, aveng-

. ing a 5-4 loss earlier in the sea-

son. Hathorn had nothing but
praise for those who did the scor-
‘ing. Freshman Kimberly Bishop,
who plays first home, scored the
first two goals and also handed
out two assists. Sophomore Brook
Tinley, at second home, followe¢
‘with a third first-half goal.
Halftime found the game tied
at 3, so  Hathorn’s _ pep-talk
Stressed maintaining possession of
the ball, and the team came cut

_ determined to do just that.

W&L's left attack wing Shawn
Werlyga sophomore, racked up

_ three ods and freshman Devon
McAllister, substituting for Tinley,
‘scored the final goal.

While her teammates were
busy scoring goals, freshman goal-
‘ie Erica Ingersoll was busy mak-
ing sure Hollins didn’t do the
same,

“Erica had an amazing game,”’
said Hathom. ‘‘She made 23
saves and we figured out that her
‘saving percentage was 82 per cent
for the game.”

Regarding strategical prepara-
‘tion, Hathorn said the team con-
centrated on its defense and tried
to anticipate the moves of Hollins’
‘best players. This technique
worked perfectly, but Hathorn was
struck by another aspect of the
team’s performance.

“The observation I made
which impressed me the most was
the heart and spirit we played
with. Hollins played just as hard,
though, so it was even more grati-
fying to win,”

The game followed on_ the
heels of a disappointing cancella-
tion on Monday. Virginia Tech
backed out of what was scheduled
to be the Generals last home
game.

“‘T think we recovered extreme-
ly well from that let-down,’’ said
Hathorn.

W&L, 7-7, enters the second
round of the ODAC tournament
on Friday when the Generals trav-
el to Salem to take on Roanoke
College.

Hathormn is looking forward to
that game but is still euphoric
aoout the victory over Hollins.
She even slipped into a little ide-
alism with the comment, “‘Every-
thing just came together in the

end--just like in Hoosiers.”’

twice in the season, with W&L
winning both times. Freshman
pitcher Steve Momorella got the
win in both of those games, and
although it is difficult to beat a
team three times in one season,
Momorella got the start once
again against the Royals.

Momorella and the Generals
wasted no time in asserting their
presence. Momorella sent the
Royals down in order in the top
of the first, and in the bottom
half, the Generals bats went to
work. After senior shortstop
Harry Halpert grounded out, senior
third baseman Tony Waskiewicz
doubled off the right-center field

wall. Tom Skeen, the senior
center-fielder, then walked, and
senior catcher Eddie Klank singled
to left field, scoring Waskiewicz.
The run proved to be Klank’s fifth
game winning hit of the season as
the Generals went on a tear.

In the second, Max Petzold,
the first baseman, singled with one
out. Second baseman Bobby
Rimmer, a junior, singled him to
second, and Petzold, a senior was
forced out on a questionable call
on Halpert’s ground ball to third.
Waskiewicz then singled to score
Rimmer from second. Skeen then
doubled off the base of the left
field wall, driving in Halpert and
Waskiewicz. Skeen’s double
chased EMC starter Doug Friesen,
who fell to 2-6 on the season.

Jerry Arbogast, the new
pitcher, hit Klank on the elbow

with his first pitch. Grace then
singled, scoring Skeen.
Sophomore right fielder Tim

Wheeler then crushed a pitch to
right field, sending it well over
the wall for a three-run homer, his

first of the season.
W&L led 10-0 after two
innings. The Generals scored five

more times in the third, off Carl

Ness, the ace of the Royals staff,
keyed Wheeler’s two-run
double. All told, the Generals
took batting practice in the first
three innings, registering 15 runs
on 16 hits.

Momorella pitched well enough
to win, moving to 6-0, but had to
come out after reaching the 100-
pitch mark and running into
trouble in the sixth. Senior Chris
Cunningham came on to pitch the
final three-plus innings to earn his
first save on the season.

Skeen was four-for-four, Grace
four-for-six, and Rimmer three-for-
five to lead the W&L_ attack.
Wheeler drove in a career-high
five runs, while Skeen and Grace
had 4 RBI apiece in the 18-8 win.
All told, the Generals pounded out
22 hits.

The Lexington Country Club
golf course was burned this week.
Not literally, but figuratively.

In the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference golf championships on
Monday and Tuesday, six teams
posted up some of the lowest
scores in conference championship
history. When the = smoked
cleared, Lynchburg had taken the
team title with an unheard-of two-
round total of 597. Washington
and Lee, despite shooting some of
its best golf ever, could finish no
better than fourth.

“‘{Lynchburg] definitely won
it,’ said W&L head coach Buck
Leslic. ‘‘We’re a little disappoint-
ed but that’s a temporary thing.
Those are the best scores we've

had since that cra (the — late
1970s).”’

W&L, with a score of 300,
found itself in striking distance
after Monday’s play, trailing sur-

One of the more pleasant surprises this sports

‘ year has come from the 1989 Washington and Lee

baseball Generals.

The baseball team has risen above expectations to
put together their best season in 17 years. For their
success, the baseball team has been chosen as the
Ring-tum Phi Athletes-of-the-Month for April.

For the first time in the school’s history in the
Old Dominion Athletic Conference, W&L played
host to a tournament game and routed Eastern
Mennonite 18-8.

It is not just the fact that the Generals have
achieved what they have, but the way in which they
did it. By sweeping a three game series from West
Virginia Tech to start the season, the Generals got
off to one of their best starts ever.

The Generals were 4-6 after dropping a double-
header to start the month at Shenandoah. From
their W&L took off, winning seven of their last nine
to get where they are right now. The leaders during
the streak have been freshman starting pitcher Steve
Momorella, who is 6-0 with a 2.98 earned run
average, and senior catcher Eddie Klank, hitting .370
for the season with four homers, 20 runs batted in
and five game winning hits.

‘‘We were cruising along, unsure of ourselves
until we beat Lynchburg,’’ said senior tri-captain
Mike Temple. ‘‘We didn’t believe in ourselves, and

and have been unstoppable since then,”’

Late inning heroics have been the mode of
triumph for the Generals, earning five of the seven
wins, all five in a row, by scoring in the last two
innings. In sweeping a double header at Emory &
Henry, the Generals scored three times in the last
two innings to take the opener 3-0 and 10 times in
the last two innings to take the night-cap 20-11.

At Lynchburg, the Generals scored five times in
the ninth to win 5-3, with the winning runs coming
on senior third baseman Tony Waskiewicz’s home
run. Against second place Hampden-Sydney, Klank
settled a tie game in the bottom of the ninth with a
booming home run to center field to break a 4-4 tie
and give W&L a 6-4 win.

In April, the Generals have raised their team
batting average from .275 after 13 games to .315
after their ODAC tournament win over Eastern
Mennonite. Leading the way are Klank, .370, senior
center fielder Tom Skeen, .347 up from .250, and
Grace, .410 up from .333, Waskiewicz, .333.

Said Temple, ‘“‘We’ve played together for three
or four years, and we’ve finally come together. Due
to the senior leadership, mainly Eddie Klank’s, and

freshman, especially Steve Momorella, Brian Harper,
and Pete Klingelhofer. We're finally where we

want to be.”’
Congratulations to the Washington and Lee
baseball team, the Ring-tum Phi Athletes-of-the-

Month for April.

Tennis teams complete conference double

 

By Stu Sheldon
Staff Reporter

 

Both the Washington and Lee
men’s and women’s tennis teams
brought home the gold this past
weekend for Washington & Lee.

Men’s head coach Gary Franke
has to be very excited, as he was
named ODAC Coach-of-the-Year
for the sixth time. More
importantly, though, his netters are
playing quality tennis again.

Every W&L singles player won
his flight. At No.1, John Morris
grabbed not only the championship
but also ODAC  PLayer-of-the-
Year honors. Senior co-captains
Bobby Matthews and Robert
Haley, playing at No. 2 and No. 3
for the Generals, both won as
well,

tention.

“We thought it could come
down to us and Lynchburg,’’ said
Leslic. “‘We just didn’t make a
very good run at it.”’

The Generals received an ex-
cellent performance from freshman
Jay McKnight, who finished tied
for second with a 148 (73-75),
one stroke behind medalist Mike
Crabtree of Lynchburg. Seniors
Tom Wingfield (78-79) and Pete
Coleman (76-80) also played well
for W&L. Freshman Clay Thom-
as carded an impressive 73 in the
first round, but his second round
of 78 was disqualified when he
signed a wrong scorecard.

The mistake proved not to be a
serious one, only costing the Gen-
crals two strokes. Even with
Thomas’ score counting, the Gen-
erals would have finished two
strokes, instead of the actual four,
behind Roanoke’s 610. Randolph-
Macon held on for second place
with a 606.

Ernie was always my _ favorite.
How could anyone resist the
“Rubber Duckie’’ song, or those
drum solos in the middle of the
night that would wake Bert up out
of a dead sleep and __ that
unbelievable laugh. Yeah, Ernie
was definitely my favorite,

Today it seems like just
yesterday but in reality it was 15
years ago. In years to come when
I look back on my life, I have no

doubt that ‘“‘Sesame Street’’ will
hold some of the _ fondest
memories of my childhood. It’s

not often that we are ever given
the chance to relive parts of our
childhood, but this Sunday at
VMI’s Cameron Hall, we all can.
At 3 pm. Sunday, 100
Rockbridge County children, 10
members of the W&L Chorus, an

“Family Pops Concert’ at

The concert, sponsored by
Washington and Lee and _ the

FAIR (Fine Arts In Rockbridge)
Group, will showcase songs and
medleys from ‘‘Sesame  Street’’
and the Broadway stage ranging
stylistically from rock to jazz to
pop to  country/western. — In

very hard. The show was an
unbelievable success.””

Kolman also _- praised
Washington and Lee’s support of
the University/Rockbridge County
Symphony Orchestra. During the
past year W&L has, for the first

 

time, supported the symphony
financially and has given students
participating in the ensemble

academic credit.

“W&L thinks music and drama
and the arts are so important that
it is willing to support them
financially, Kolman said.’ ‘‘In a
day and age when orchestras are
closing almost monthly, its to

Though last year’s Family Pops

E

concert was similar to this year’s
show, Kolman said he wanted to
put together a show that crossed
between the younger children and

the college students. Enter Bob
McGrath.

“McGrath has that universal
appeal’’ Kolman said.  “‘His
repertoire includes pop, country

and rock as well as all the songs
from ‘‘Sesame Street.’ He has a
formal musical background and
has a beautiful lyric tenor voice.”

And indeed, McGrath does
have an impressive background.
After graduating with a B.A. in
music from the University of
Michigan, McGrath eventually
went on to receive a master’s
degree =o music “from the
Manhattan School of Music in
New York City. After graduation,
McGrath sang with Fred Waring,
fgor Stravinsky and Robert Shaw,
just to name a few.

After working in New York,
McGrath travelled to Japan where
he enjoyed a successful career
singing popular music. Hoping to
carry his success across the ocean
back to the U.S., McGrath
returned to New York in 1969, It
was then, when he met an old
friend from Michigan, that his life
and his career would change
forever.

When his friend first suggested
“this new educational children’s
show with puppets’’ McGrath
knew immediately that he wanted
no part of it. Half a year and
many, many auditions later, having
come to the realization that
“Sesame Street’? was more than
just some kiddy show, McGrath

NEW IN
LEXINGTON

The Ring-tum Phi, April 27, 1989

2rt debuts Sunday

Bob McGrath will host the extravaganza

successful children’s program in
the history of television.

According to McGrath,
‘Sesame Street’? is now seen in
more than 80 English-speaking
nations and in 12 countries with
foreign co-productions in Spanish,
German, French and Portuguese.
They are all, however, quite
unique.

The production in Isracl, for
instance, is hoping to be just as
influential as the one in the
United States. In Israel, half of the
cast is Isracli and half is Arab;
definitely something unique in that
country. McGrath said that the
focus of that particular cast, much
like the one in most countries, is
to show that people who are
different can live together.

Over the years = “Sesame
Street’” has taught us all that
lesson but it has also taught us
much, much more. McGrath
recalled a story that happened to
him just a couple of weeks ago
that illustrates just how
wonderfully influential ‘“‘Sesame
Street’’ has been.

“‘T was in the Newark airport
and the girl behind the ticket
counter recognized me,” he said.
‘We got to talking and when we
were through I said kind of
jokingly ‘I guess we changed your
life. Right?” And she said, ‘Yes,
you did.’

‘I grew up in the worst of the
Newark projects with violence. and
drugs all around me. It was all I
knew. But ‘‘Sesame Street’’ was
the one calm part of my day and
when I saw it, I knew that there
was some place different in the
world where different kinds of
people lived together and got
along, I decided then that when I
grew up I was going to get out of
these projects and go to college.’
She did go to college and now
she works for the airline,”
McGrath said. ‘‘Stories like that
make it all worth it.”’

You can be sure that McGrath
and the rest of the cast of the
spring Family Pops concert will
bring that same ‘‘Sesame Street’
magic to this Sunday’s concert at
Cameron Hall. Come hear “‘The
Sesame Street Song,’ ‘The
People in Your Neighborhood’’
and ‘‘Trash’’ as well as the
production numbers from ‘42nd
Street’’ and ‘‘Barnum.’’ The
afternoon promises to be
entertaining and memorable for
all.

Tickets will be $10 for adults
and $5 for students. Everyone
come and support the orchestra,
the chorus, the Lexington children
and Bob McGrath. Come and
relive your childhood. I’m going
and Ernie’s not even going to be
there.
