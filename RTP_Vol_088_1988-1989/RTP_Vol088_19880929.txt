J-prof requests honor guidelines

‘By Stacy L Morrison

« Prof. Hampden H. Smith asked the
Executive Committee to make an ex-
‘plicit statement that students correctly
following guidelines of their profes-
sors could not be brought up on honor
charges.
At Monday night’s EC meeting
‘Smith said, ‘“‘It would be terrible to
«, have a student caught between the
honor system and a faculty member.”’

EC member would find a student gui-

up.
+ Smith, a professor in the Depart-

ment of Journalism, said he teaches
* skills courses in news writing where
«students are instructed to use other

newsstories for background informa-
‘tion. ‘‘In the ‘real world,’ news, in-
, formation and facts cannot be copyr-

ighted. It is habitual to use that infor-
* mation for an article.’’

« EC Member Dave Nave said that if
other students are not clear on the
‘professor’s policy, an investigation
,could be started before the EC learns
the student is operating under specific
*guidelines. EC Member Alston Parker
said, ‘“Do we need to go one step far-
ther and state what is implicitly under-

Smith is not sure that it is implicit
and said, ‘‘I would feel far more com-
‘fortable if it were clear to everyone

IFC initiates
new program:
Live Drive

‘By Clint Wheelock
Staff Reporter

 

, Drunk driving accidents account for
hundreds of deaths and uncountable
‘injuries each year.

To combat this crisis, the Inter-
, fraternity Council outlined a plan,
called Live Drive, at its meeting
*Tuesday night. The program will pro-
,vide shuttle service for intoxicated
students at university functions or
‘fraternity parties in the country. Ser-
vice will go to certain points on or
‘near the Washington and Lee campus
‘at specified times.

‘ Live Drive will use two vans in it’s
shuttle service. The program is at-
tempting to obtain its own van. Each
van will have two drivers trained to
secognize over-intoxication and other
medical trouble signs. The vans are
‘insured and part of the program’s ex-
pense is being paid by the Student Ac-
‘tivities Board. The Executive Com-
gnittee and the IFC are currently con-
sidering giving funds to the program.

The project chairmen assert that
‘they do not want to make a judgement
against underage drinking, but rather,
they want to keep people safe.

Live Drive will begin service
Homecoming weekend. The project
chairmen urge all fraternities to notify
them about house functions in ad-
vance, in order that they can be ready
to help.

taking computer science courses are
told to do their own work, although
they are allowed to consult with other

East Asian

By Caly Smith
Staff Reporter

The Washington and Lee East Asian
Studies Program offers students of all
majors opportunities to study abroad.
The W&L program sponsors schol-
arships or exchange programs to To-
kyo, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the
Kyoto-Osaka area during the aca-
demic year and Chinese and Japanese
language studies during the summer.

Professor Roger B. Jeans, chairman
of the East Asian Studies Committee,
encouraged all students to consider
“the wealth of opportunities’ offered
by the program.

To spend the academic year in To-
kyo, a student should have two years
of Japanese classroom experience to
apply for the Rikkyo University
Scholarship. A full scholarship sup-
ports this program with a generous
lump sum given upon arrival, fol-
lowed by additional monthly stipends,
according to Jeans.

Chinese study in Taiwan similarly
requires a student to have two years
credit of Chinese to qualify for the
scholarship offering approximately
$400 a month. Students who have stu-
died in Taiwan have always received
scholarships, Jeans said.

programs offer variety

The third scholarship, funded by the
Mellon Foundation Grant and new this
year, provides funds for students to
take Chinese or Japanese during the
summer. With this program, a student

has a number of options such as study-_

ing at Middleburg College or going
abroad to Taiwan, Japan or China. A
flat sum of $250, $500 or $1,000 will
be granted, depending on the Finan-
cial Aid Office’s assessment of the
student’s finances.

As for the other programs offered,

there is no language requirement for
a student wanting to study at the
Chinese University of Hong Kong or
the Kansai University of Foreign Stu-
dies, since English is one of the main
languages spoken.
’ Jeans said, ‘“‘Hong Kong is no
longer restricted to Chinese language
students; it’s wide open to students of
all majors. I’m hoping that students
will follow a former W&L student's
example who studied in Hong Kong
while pursuing his major of business
administration.”’

The Kansai University program is
flexible since it is not necessary for
the student to study Chinese to parti-
cipate in the exchange program, and a
student may stay for one or two
semesters.

Opportunities also are available for
study in the People’s Republic of
China through the program sponsored
by the University of Massachusetts.
Students can go to the Mandarin-s-
peaking zones of Peking or Sian.

To apply to one of the East Asian
Programs, a student must fill out an

In deciding a candidate’s eligibility,
Jeans said, ‘‘The committee first con-
siders the student’s academic record,
then examines the student’s maturity
level to ensure that he or she could
handle being dropped off in East
Asia.””

This year, Yumi Morishige, Hideo

EC proposes
new plan for
CRC debate

By SacyL. Morison

Staff Reporter

 

The Executive Committee will draw
up a formal proposal for an alternate
committee to the Confidential Review
Committee, EC President Christopher
deMovellan said.

EC Member Dave Nave said, ‘‘I
think we can come up with the com-
mittee that will please the faculty and
the students. ’’

Issues of concern that the EC has
taken into consideration are confiden-
tiality, the ratio of faculty to students
and representation of the student body
on the committee, said EC Member
Dan DuPre. DuPre and EC Member
John Fialcowitz met with members of
the student body last week to define
what the student body wants.

DeMovellan said, ‘‘I don’t want to
rush this [writing the proposal,] but at
the same time, I feel it is an urgent
matter.’’

Several options for the alternate
committee were considered before the
EC settled on the seven -member
committee. The SCC came to the
meeting and presented their standpoint
again. ‘‘I really feel’that the SCC can
handle those cases,” SCC Chairman
David Burns said. ‘‘If the problem is
confidentiality within the SCC, I
would like to see SCC members to
take part in the counseling program
that the CRC members received.’’

But deMovellan is concerned over
what will happen in following years.
Said deMovellan, ‘‘Most deans agree
that this year’s SCC is stellar, but
what happens the year after that?’’
DeMovellan said continuity is impor-
tant in this type of committee. Often,
he said, student committees are forced
to ‘‘re-invent the wheel’’ each year
when members graduate.

EC Member DuPre said, ‘‘The
problem is not that the SCC can’t
handle the job. The problem is the
cases aren’t getting to the SCC.”’

To absolve the above concerns, the
EC voted 10-1 to propose a committee
composed of two faculty members,
three students from the SCC and two
students-at-large. [All of these mem-
bers will each have one vote.] The fa-
culty members are to be appointed by
President Wilson, and the student
members, including the SCC mem-
ibers, will be appointed by the EC.

EC Member John McDonough
voted against the proposal because he
thinks the faculty members should be
non-voting.

EC Vice-President Hugh Finkel-
stein will go before the faculty Oc-
tober 2, at its montly meeting, to an-
nounce that the EC will submit a for-
mal proposal for an alternate commit-
tee at the faculty’s next meeting.

New Virginia lottery
enriches some students

By Genienne Mongno
Staff Reporter

 

A Washington and Lee student has
cashed in on the new Virginia State
Lottery, which began on Sept. 20.

Senior Brad Gottsegen won $50
when he bought three tickets at Stop-
In last Tuesday. He said he felt lucky
when he walked in, so he decided to
give the game a try. “‘It’s not bad
spending a buck and winning 50,’’ he
said. According to Gottsegen, he was
the only one in the store at the time to
win one of the bigger prizes. Ironica-
lly, someone behind him spent$150
and got only $4 in return.

Other students have been enjoying
the lottery as well. Junior Marty
Smith won $6 but lost it all when she
spent the money buying more tickets.
According to local retailers, about 50
percent of the tickets are bought by
W&L students.

Tickets for the instant win game,
known as Match 3, can be purchased
at several locations in the Lexington
area, and since the game’s inception,
suppliers have had a hard time keep-
ing up with the demand for tickets.
The Stop-In convenience store on
North Main Street sold out of the tick-
ets the first day and has had to reorder
twice.

Although traffic in the participating
stores has increased, both workers and
store owners have mixed opinions
about the game. One worker at Stop-
In said bluntly, ‘‘It’s a pain in the
a--!’’ She commented that among
other problems, people just come in to

buy lottery tickets which has resulted
ina lot of loitering.

Another Stop-In representative,
Francine Carter, said that when there
is a lot of work to do it’s hard tp ac-
commodate everyone. However, she
said she still believes in the lottery if
the profits are really going to help the
Commonwealth.

Miles Nye of Kelly’s Corner con-
venience store said it’s too early to tell
whether the lottery will increase busi-
ness since it’s still a novelty. He said
the first few days were like a ‘‘circus
or carnival’? and his business was
probably hurt by it.

Recently, however, lottery sales
have slowed down somewhat and Nye
believes that business will be helped.
So far Kelly’s Corner has sold about
3,200 tickets and the biggest winner
has won $50. According to Nye, the
majority of the people who win the
smaller prizes of $2, $5, and $10, use
the money to buy more tickets,

Bridget Cooper of the Palms said
that they have had three $50 winners
among the many winners of the smal-
ler prizes. In her opinion the lottery is
a good thing, but she warned, ‘‘Don’t
get hooked!”’

This first phase of the Virginia state
lottery will last about eight weeks. A
second instant game will follow. If all
goes as planned, there will be six
different instant games during the first
year. For every dollar spent on a Vir-
ginia Lottery ticket 35 cents goes back
to the state to be put in Virginia’s
General Fund. Lawmakers will decide
which state programs will benefit
most from the money.
 

 

 

 

OPINION

Decide soon...

It is a fact that many W&L students have been the subject of reli-
gious, racial or sexual discrimination and harassment. Members of
the faculty, the student body, and the administration who are not
perpetrating these prejudices want it stopped. And everyone agrees
that if it is to stop, it must be exposed.

The problem is that most of the students who have been harassed
or discriminated against do not expose the crimes committed against
them because they are embarrassed. Presently, a student who wants
to bring up such a charge must do so in front of the Student Conduct
Committee. Students are obviously not comfortable discussing
these sensitive issues before the SCC, because last year the Com-
mittee heard only two cases while the Dean of Minority Students,
Anise McCloud, heard fourteen.

The faculty felt that students were not bringing these cases to the
SCC because they were worried that secrecy could not be main-
tained on a committee (SCC) consisting of 13 members. To fix the
problem the faculty took the initiative and formed the seven- mem-
ber Confidential Revue Committee. Four of the seven CRC mem-
‘ bers are from the faculty while the other three are students.

Some SCC members are against the CRC because they feel like
the faculty majority is a serious threat to the W&L tradition of stu-
dent government. The SCC warns of the inherent dangers in giving
the CRC unchecked power to investigate and discipline offenders.

The SCC has proposed that it form a small sub-committee that
offers the advantages of the CRC, but keeps power with the stu-
dents. The big question then is whether students would prefer to
bring sensitive issues to their peers or to members of the faculty,
not whether the SCC is capable of handling the cases.

Regardless of how it is done, changes must be made immediately.
As a school, we are not providing the means to help students with
some very serious problems.

There are some common misconceptions concerning committees
that deal with sensitive issues. A lot of male students incorrectly be-
lieve that these committees are support groups for females who
want to whine about chauvinists who hate co- education. These
committees are for all students.

Men are by no means isolated from sexual harassment. In fact,
males who have been harassed by females or homosexuals are very
reluctant to discuss their case with anyone. Males, as well as fe-
males, would benefit from a more confidential committee.

Sexual, religious and racial harassment is unexcusable on any
level. The University must do everything in its power to help elim-
inate these problems and a more confidential committee is a step in
the right direction. If the CRC can do a better job in this area than
the SCC, then they should be allowed to do it. At the same time, the
SCC has some valid concerns that deserve to be reviewed.

Hopefully an effective compromise can be reached...SOON.

All of Lexington not honor-bound

 

MY VIEW
By Beckwith Archer

 

After two weeks of living in a Uto-
pian environment, I received a harsh
welcome back into the real world last
week. I hope that this article will serve
as a warning to everyone on campus
who is a trusting as my roommates
and I were.

I was studying late last Wednesday.
Around 1:30 a.m. I got up to get a
book from my room. I shut the door
behind me and after about two minutes
I began to hear little shuffling noises. I
figured that one of my roommates was
up so I ignored the sounds. Whey they
persisted for about five minutes I de-

cided to go see what it was. When I
opened the door there was a man
standing in our suite with his hand on
the doorknob to one of the tooms. All
I could do was stand there, terrified.
He was about mediurh build with
blonde hair and a tattoo on his right
arm. He very calmly turned and said,
“Oh, I must be in the wrong room,”’

and then he walked out. I turned to see -

which way he went and I saw that he
had propped the front door wide open
with a shoe, in preparation for his get-
away. I have to wonder why instead of
taking the television or microwave in
the den, he had decided to risk going
into one of the rooms, the only single
girlroominthe suite. .

was taken to the police station. Ten
minutes after we got there, a call came

Degeneration
by rock-n-roll

 

MY VIEW
By Jon Sbar

 

In order to deal with a vital is-
sue, I have been forced to postpone
my planned continuation of the
male-female controversy in which I
was attempting to determine just
how far a topic could be dragged
out. This issue concerns the
degeneration of America’s youth. As
the reader probably suspects, I have
nothing important to say about it. In
the hopes of making myself more
socially accepted, I am officially
endorsing the Moral Majority’s
efforts to make adolescents more
like Benjamin Franklin.

The problem started in the 60s
when children, who once enjoyed
geography and chocolate chip coo-
kies, became the hippie teenagers

who traveled to Woodstock for .

‘rampant sex, nudity and a haze of
marijuana smoke.’’ Since the 60s,
this vicious youth-destroying cycle
has continued. Even as I write, ado-
lescents about the world continue to
move farther and farther from the
ideals of Franklin. No one knows
exactly why this is happening to our
youth, but it must stop. Some ex-
perts blame a dependence on the
mind-altering ingredients in Lucky
Charms and other psychoactive
cereals, While I support movements
to ban these harmful cereals, I be-
lieve the problem goes much
deeper. It reaches into the very core
of human existence. As you know,

the core of human existence is mu-
sic. Friends, believe me when I tell
you that rock music is destroying
our youth. Rock music takes away
inhibition, encourages -anti-social
behavior and generally makes no
sense —the three things needed to
ruin a young life. Card-carrying
Moral Majority and Woodstock,
N.Y., resident, Minerva Reinscha-
gen said it best when she remarked
that rock music is ‘‘devil inspired.’’

A well-known Tampa, Fla., mu-
sic expert believes that the problem
with rock music is in the drums. He
explained that ‘‘primitive peoples in
ages past have always used the drum
as a means of arousal to warfare or
orgy.’’ and rock music relies heav-
ily ‘‘on the inordinate use of this
percussion instrument.’ The link
between rock music and drugs is de-
finite; the only question is ‘‘whether
the drugs are used to calm down
listeners or arouse them further?’’
Remember, ‘‘music is the language
of the emotions and can make peo-
ple do almost anything.’’ The sad
truth, which Ann Landers has
known for years, is that rock-n-roll
causes insanity.

An addition side effect of rock
music is that it is played so loud that
young fans cannot carry on a con-
versation. Many hardcore fans have
entirely forgotten how to communi-
cate with other humans.

A modern danger of rock music is
music television. In a music telev-
ision video, harmful music is ac-
companied by visual effects, which
include only three elements:

1. effeminate men with very

in. Someone had just been seen going
through a dresser in one of the houses
around campus. For the next three
hours, while: I filled ‘out’ reports ‘and
looked at naug shots, the :police told
me about the crime rate in Lexington.

The amount of crime goes up dras-:
tically when the students return to
school because we are such easy tar-
gets. We leave our doors unlocked,
keys in the car, and valuables laying
around. These people follow crowds
out into the country and make a for-
tune off of the big parties. The only
advice that the police had was to lock
the doors and to make sure that things
left in a car are not visible from the
outside.

The police called me a couple of
days ago and told me that they believe
that they have caught the man who

3. some type of sexual re-
lationship between the effeminate
men and the beautiful women.

Because these videos are so pain-
fully stupid, a person who watches
more than five will actually begin to
kill brain cells.

Voter registration held for college students

 

y Brooke Jarabek
Staff Reporter

 

In 1972, the national voting age was
changed from 21 to 18 and almost 50
percent of the 18 -24 age group voted.
However, in 1980, only about 39 per-
cent of this age group voted. Insuffi-
cient knowledge on how to register to
vote and about the candidates and is-
sues themselves are two reasons for
this decline in youth voter turnout.

To solve this problem, the National
Student Campaign for Voter Registra-
tion, the NSCVR, and the United
States Student Association, USSA,
organized a 1500-member National
Student Conference on Voter Regis-
tration in 1984. These students re-
gistered more than 500,000 voters at
750 college campuses. But despite the
increase in new voters, the number of

all 18-24 year-olds who voted still re-
mained at less than 41 percent.

Another voter registration confer-
ence is scheduled Sept. 30-Oct. 2 in
Washington, D.C. to further encour-
age youth votes in the 1988 election.

According to Fred Azcarate, presi-
dent of USSA, ‘‘Once registered, 80
percent of all 18-24 year-olds vote on
election day.’’ This percentage is
equal to other age groups.

Voter registration procedures vary
from state to state. For example, Min-
nesota allows registration on election
day, while Arizona requires registra-
tion 50 days before an election.

New laws, like public law 91-285,
which allow for temporary and mail-
in registration, will make it easier for
students to vote this year.

Any W&L student who has not re-
gistered to vote in the upcoming

Visitor’s Center grows

By Laura Dodge
Staff Reporter

For those who have not heard, Lex-
ington has a new Visitor’s Center.
Located in the Centel Building on
Washington Street directly across
from its old home, the new center has
expanded in both space and content.

In August, the lease for the old Visi-
tor’s Center expired and they moved
across the street where they are open
from 9- 5,

The Visitor’s Center has expanded
to meet the growing number of tou-
‘rist coming through Lexington. In
‘1976, 131 visitors signed the book.
‘This year the number of visitors has
‘already increased 8 percent over
‘1987. on

Jean Clark, head of the Center,
which is part of the Visitor’s Bureau
of Lexington, said that tourists come
‘from March through November, not
just in the summer months. She said
the staff at the center ‘‘must know a
little bit about just about everything.’’
They answer questions on a range of
subjects about Lexington and the East
coast. Clark also said that many for-
eign visitors come through Lexington.

Usually, guides advise all new-
comers in Lexington to visit both
Washington and Lee University and
Virginia Military Institute. W&L’s
main attraction is Lee Chapel, where
General Lee worked the last five years

of his life. The Stonewall Jackson
House and his grave in the city
cemetery are additional attractions. A
guided tour of Jackson’s house is
available every hour on the half-hour
for $3.50. Two museums at VMI are
mentioned as well. One offers a his-
tory of the institute, Jackson and the
Civil War and the other, the George
C. Marshall Museum, gives World
War II history.

To discover additional interesting
Sites, the Visitor’s Center distributes a
general brochure of Lexington, and a
walking guide of the city. It describes
over 40 sites to visit in Lexington. For
those who don’t want to walk, the
Visitor's Center offers a shuttle ser-
vice each day from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00
p.m. The shuttle gathers and delivers
tourists to sites at VMI, Lee Chapel,
“Stonewall’’ Jackson House, and
three stops in downtown Lexington.
The cost is $2 per person.

Another way to view Lexington is
by a carriage tour. These tours are
offered Mon. through Sat., 9:30-5:30
p.m., for $6 per person. The carriage
covers all the walking tour sites, but
does not stop.

The Visitor’s Bureau offers several
displays on area history, local arts,
crafts and industries and local archi-
tecture. Clark said, ‘‘The Visitor’s
Center is here to.sell the area, but we
provide «information ‘on: everything
else too.”’ J

presidential election may pick up an
absentee ballot from Lucille Joyce,
the general registrar, in Lexington
City Hall.

This temporary registration form
may be sent to any state but only al-
lows a citizen to vote in the presi-
dential election. Following the presi-
dential election, the registration is de-
clared null and void. For permanent
registration, a student must officially
register within his precinct.

Virginia residents who have not re-
gistered will find the Virginia Appli-
cation for Temporary Voter Registra-
tion as well as Absentee Ballot Appli-
cation (both are pink forms) at City
Hall. Those Virginia residents who
are registered and are not planning to
attend the polls within their precinct
need to fill out the blue Virginia Ab-
sentee Ballot Application.

  

The deadline for registration in Vir-
ginia is Oct. 8 and absentee ballots
must be received by the county regis-
trar at least 5 days before the election.

**Most states,’’ Joyce said, ‘‘have a
close-out period form 15-30 days
prior to the election for temporary re-
gistration and absentee ballots.”’
Thus, out-of-state students should ap-
ply as soon as possible and Joyce will
furnish them with forms.

Students may register to vote in
Lexington, if their legal address is in
Lexington. A legal address would in-
clude a driver’s license address and
possibly car registration at that ad-
dress.

An important point for students to
remember is that absentee ballots must
be witnessed. Some states may require
notarization. Two notaries who work
in the W&L Treasurers ottice are
Myrna Zybco and Sharon Edwards.

Foxfield races draw 5,000

By Eleanor Nelson
Staff Reporter

 

 

Pal

Brooke Tinley, sophomore, Ti-
monium, MD. ‘“‘I think Bush won
because of his foreign policy.”’

Despite last Sunday’s cold and wet
weather conditions, approximately
5,000 people attended the Foxfield
races in Charlottesville.

The crowd was considerably smal-
ler than previous years, drawing only
about 5,000 people. Typically the
races draw 18,000 to 25,000, accord-
ing to J. Benjamin Dick, organizer of
the races.

Albemarle County police said viola-
tions were down this year primarily
due to the smaller crowd. The police
arrested eight individuals for underage
possession of alcohol and five for
drunk in public. One policeman said
that although these people were not
the only ones drunk at the event, they
‘‘were falling down drunk. We don’t
bother them if they can walk.’’

Three people were arrested for pos-

session of marijuana, one for posses-

sion of mushrooms, one for driving
under the influence of alcohol and two
for trespassing. Seven people received
traffice summonses.

The general admission ticket price
increased from $8 to $10 and field
tickets increased from $40 to $60 this
year. Despite the fact that ticket prices
have not increased for a few years,
according to the race’s organizers,
several students were displeased with
the rate increase. Race’ organizers said
increasing costs of running horse
races spurred the price rise.

Some fraternities cancelled plans to
attend the races despite previously
purchased tickets and chartered buses.
Among the students who did attend,
the typical afternoon of tailgate parties
and socializing did take place. One
student reflected that despite .the.smal-
ler crowd, ‘‘there were still long lines
at the bathroom!”’

VMI exhibit opens

By Tina Vandersteel
Staff Reporter

 

The first major exhibition ever as-
sembled of Civil War Confederacy art
opens formally tomorrow, at Virginia
Military Institute’s Jackson Memorial
Hall and it will remain on display ,
free to the public, until Dec. 12.

The display, titled ‘The Confeder-
ate Image: Prints of the Lost Cause’’
will open at 7 p.m. with lectures by
Harold Holzer of New York City and
Gabor S. Boritt of Gettysburg, Pa.,
who are the two of the three authors of
the book by the same name. The pub-
lic is also invited to attend a reception
after the lectures at 7:30 p.m. in the
museum.

The exhibit features a compilation
of over 50 original 19th century en-
gravings and lithographs, including

Confederate etchings by Adalbert J.
Volck and portraits of Confederate

U.Va. poet to read

heroes Robert E. Lee, ‘‘Stonewall’’
Jackson and Jefferson Davis. Most
historians agree that these images of
the “‘Lost Cause’’ helped unify the
Southern people after suffering dev-
astating losses in the war. These pic-
tures, which decorated the walls of
family homes, schoolrooms, and pub-
lic buildings during and after the Civil
War, helped to remind the Southern
people that their cause was a noble
one.

Holzer and Boritt’s book, co-
authored by Mark E. Neely, has been
well-received all across the nation. It

has been features in numerous
national publications, including
**American Art Journal.”’

The exhibit, sponsored by Gettys-
burg College, the Pennsylvania Hu-
manities Council and the Lincoln
National Life Insurance Company
opened last year in Gettysburg in July.

Wright became a member of the fa-
culty at UVa in 1983. Among several
writing awards, Wright received the
National Endowment for Arts awards
in 1974 and 1984. In 1975. he was
awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in
poetry. Wright continued on to win
the Edgar Allen Poe Award of the
Academy of American Poets in 1976.

so far, Tiffany said the demanding
work, the helpful professors, the
beautiful campus and the crazy party
atmosphere stuck out in her mind. She
said, ‘‘The fraternity atmosphere is
too crazy for me, yet the people here
are very friendly and even though I
can’t understand all the English I en-
counter, I am learning and I enjoy
that."’

In previous years, one speaker a
year came to represent all of East
Asia. In 1985, the program received a
Mellon Foundation Grant that enabled
the program to offer two to three
speakers a year, plus some sort of cul-

ture event.

Jeans said, ‘‘In 1986, we sponsored
a No Drama Performance. Last spring
we held a Japanese Film Festival and
this year we're again going to view the
Pacific War Film Festival and possi-
bly sponsor a Peking Opera perfor-
mer.”’

According to Mark Spiessi who
spent last year at Kansai Gaidai, the
East Asian Studies Exchange Program
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that
will completely change a person. He
said, ‘‘A student would be wrong to
pass up the opportunity, if even vague-
ly considering it. It’s something that
can never happen again since college
doesn’t last forever.

‘‘One cannot deny there is a world
outside the United States and to waste
the opportunity offered by the East
Asian Program is almost a crime.”’

ROTC goes ‘high tech’

Washington and Lee University’s
Army ROTC department and the
National Guard’s A-Company of the
3-116 Infantry in Lexington, jointly
sponsored *‘High Tech’’ Day at W&L
Thursday, Sept. 29.

A high technology static display
was available to the public from 9
a.m. to 3 p.m on Thursday on the
W&L campus. On display at the qua-
drangle adjacent to the W&L Book-
store was the U.S. Army’s most re-

additional displays exhibiting the Ar-

vehicles and air defense systems were
exhibited at Evans Dining Hall and the

Culminating ‘‘High Tech’’ Day was
a presentation by Dr. Edward A.
Brown on ‘‘The Army’s Role in the
World of High Technology.’’ The
presentation was open to the public in
Lee Chapel. Brown, a 1962 graduate,
is director of the High Power
Microwave Technology Management
Office at the Army’s Harry Diamond
Laboratories (HDL) near Washing-
ton, D.C., As director, he functions
as the Army program manager for
Radio Frequency Directed Energy
Technology.

Brown majored in physics at W&L
and holds a master’s degree (1964)
and doctorate (1970) from New York
University. After completing his mili-
tary service in the Army, Brown con-
tinued on as a civilian employee at
HDL and was named recipient of the
Harry Diamond Laboratories Unrich

from the top is spectacular. Wear
Sturdy shoes or hiking boots; bring

| The Washington and Lee cross
| country teams opened their respective
; Seasons with mixed results last week-
end in Lexington.

The men split a tri-meet with Mary
| Washington and Washington College.
i s, led by senior Billy
| Clark, lost to Mary Washington 17-45
‘ but defeated Washington College
45-95. Clark finished fourth overall,
covering W&L’s five-mile course in
29:04.

‘*We ran as well as could be expec-
ted,’’ said men’s head coach Dick
Miller. ‘‘It was rainy. We ran against
a good team. Mary Washington is a
good men’s team.”’
| Mary Washington took the first
; three places of the race and, after
| Clark came in, grabbed places five
{and six to clinch the victory. Other
iscorers for W&L were Charles Ed-
| wards (8th, 30:03), Lee Parker (10th,
(31:19), Larry Pilkey (12th, 31:33)

and Kennon Walthall (13th, 32:12).

; The Generals just didn’t have the
‘depth against Mary Washington,
| something Miller is concerned about.

 

| ‘*We’re not as deep as we were last
lyear, or the year before,’’ he said.
\‘*The point is, we lost [Scott] Rip-
ipeon,[Richard] Moore, Rick Norris
dnd people like that.”’

) The women came up short in their
meet with Mary Washington, 15-48.

When W&It ahd Centre meet on the
football field, you can bet the ranch
and the dog on the home team.

Since 1980, the host squad has won
every time the two schools have met in
football. And Saturday the home team
won with an exclamation mark, as the
3-0 Colonels rolled to a 30-16 victory.

While the score wasn’t close,
W&L’s head coach Gary Fallon
seemed optimistic about his team’s
play against Centre on offense and on
defense.

‘*I saw a number of really impres-
sive things we did,’’ said Fallon.
‘‘Outside of our special teams, that
game might have turned out to be a
one-touchdown win.”’

As they did two weeks earlier
against Emory & Henry, the Generals
(0-2) struck first. Junior fullback Rus-
sell Crosby scored on a 33-yard trap

But the Colonels responded with a
scoring drive of their own. Centre
quarterback: ‘Kelly ..Sandidge - capped
the drive with a one-yard touchdown
run, but kicker David Harr missed the
extra point, so W&L held on to a nar-
row 7-6 lead.

But one of three W&L special-
teams disasters followed on the ensu-
ing kickoff. Sophomore slotback Carl
Gilbert took the kick but fumbled the
football when he was hit. The
Colonels recovered and went on to
take a lead they would never relin-
quish. A 21-yard field goal by Harr as
the first half ended put Centre up 9-7.

The third quarter began with spe-
cial-teams disaster number two — a
91-yard kickoff return for a touch-
down by Centre defensive back Berry
Hayes. Harr converted the PAT to
make the score 16-7.

W&L’s next drive stalled after only
three plays, and senior Tom Skeen
came on to punt. But the kick was par-

needed only an 8-yard drive to go up
23-7 and put the game out of reach.

True; the Generals would goon to *

add nine more points. —three on a
30-yard Quayle field goal and six ona
26-yard pass from junior quarterback
Chris Smythe to sophomore slotback
Tyler Suiters — but the Colonels used
a 7-yard scoring pass from Sandidge
to tight end John Bruner to keep the
Generals from pulling rank and
preserve the win.

HASHMARKS— W&L will play
host to Randolph-Macon (1-2) Satur-
day at 1:30 p.m. The Generals won in
Ashland last year, 35-28.... W&L has
not beaten the Yellow Jackets in Lex-

Volleyball turns
in strong week

 

By Beckwith Archer
Staff Reporter

 

The Washington and Lee women’s
volleyball team, in its first varsity
season, is off to a very impressive
Start.

The Generals split three consecutive
tri-matches over the past week. Yes-
terday, W&L defeated Shenandoah
but lost to Mary Baldwin in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference opener
for the Generals.

The week began with W&L (6-3)
splitting a tri-match with on Thursday
night against Roanoke and Southern
Sem. The first match of the night be-
tween W&L and Roanoke saw Roan-
oke the victor, 7-15, 12-15. W&L
came storming back in its next match
however, defeating Southern Sem in
two straight games 16-14, 15- 8. The
Generals trailed in the first game by as
much as 14-8 before making an excit-
ing comeback. The win over Southern
Sem was the team’s fourth win of the
year over the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference team.

Both head coach Susan Dittman and
student coach Steve Baldridge are
very pleased with the team and the
strides that it is making. They think
the strength of the team lies in the
unity and cohesion among the players.
Although this is a young team, the
freshmen have come in ready to work
hard alongside the veterans. There
have already been a few injuries on
the team. Junior Joanne Even has a
sprained ankle and will have to sit out

From Staff Reports

 

The W&L women’s soccer team
split four games over the past
week. The Generals traveled to
Randolph-Macon last Thursday
and fell 4-0 to the Yellow Jackets

« and then dropped a 6-0 decision to
Marymount, highly ranked in Div-
ision III, on Saturday in Lexington.

The team rebounded on Monday
with 2-1 home victory over Guil-
ford. Freshman Katie Seeman
scored both goals for the Generals.
W&L (3-4, 2-2 in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference) made it
two in a row Wednesday, with a
3-0 win over Sweet Briar. Fresh-
man Ashley Gray put the Generals
in front early and junior Catherine
Baillio added two goals to put the
game away. Sophomore goalie
Sherri Brown made eight saves en
route to her second shutout of the
season.

The Generals take on North
Carolina Wesleyan in an away
game on Saturday.

 

SPORTS NOTEBOOK

 

for about a month. The remaining in-
juries, however, are relatively minor

Senior co-captain Melissa Thrasher,
who was very happy with the team’s
performance Thursday, said, ‘‘We
were optimistic going in tonight, even
though we knew that [Roanoke] were
a really good team. We hung in with
them which is something we couldn’}
do last year. Our team gets more ex}
perienced every time we walk out on
the court and I think that next time we
play them we will have a good chance
of beating them.”’

The consensus seems to be that the
big improvement for the Generals this
year is their hitting and blocking.
Seniors Amy Smith and Vanessa
Hartman are big hitters who have
sharpened their skills since last year,
Mena McGowin and Marcy Brown
are very promising freshman hitters.
W&L also has very yood setters in
freshman Lori Rhodenizer and soph-
omore Lisa Jay.

The weekend was also successful
for the Generals. The squad had mat-
ches against Bryn Mawr and Catholic,
schools that Dittman wanted to play in
order to beef up the schedule. Though
the team lost to Bryn Mawr in a close
game 6-15, 15-13, 10-15, Dittman
was pleased to come away with an
11-15, 15-9, 15-4 win over Catholic.
She said Jay’s outstanding perfor-
mance at the setter position was what
made the difference in the Catholic
match.

The next home match for the
women’s volleyball team is Wednes-
day at 6 p.m. in the Warner Center.

aw

certainly will be no rest for the
squad this weekend.

The Generals play one of the
most crucial tournaments of the
young season this weekend in
Providence, RI, when they travel
to compete in the Northeast Varsity
Invitational. The 16-team event
features the best polo programs in
the East, <7. “)*' ’

 

The W&L men’s soccer team
dropped a couple of tough contests
last week, but scored an important
conference win Wednesday over
ODAC rival Eastern Mennonite.

The Generals (3-2, 1-1 in the
ODAC) lost to Roanoke last
Thursday 2-1, despite out-shooting
the Maroons 21-10.

On Saturday in Lexington, the
team suffered a 3-0 loss to highly-
ranked North Carolina Wesleyan.
W&L, however, salvaged the
week with a 1-0 win yesterday over
Eastern Mennonite. Junior Rick Si-
lva took a Steve Udicious pass and
connected for the game- winner in
the first half.

The Generals travel to Pennsyl-
vania on Saturday to renew a tra-

Local bands play for
Jamaican Hurricane relief

By Dana Bolden
Staff Reporter

According to Robert Luciano,
‘Rockbridge County has never seen
anything like this!’’ Luciano, owner
of Lexington’s Subway shop, is refer-
ring to this Sunday’s Gilbert Relief
Aid Festival in Rockbridge County.

Luciano says the festival was desig-
ned to help the residents of Jamaica,
whose homes were destroyed by hur-
ricane Gilbert two weeks ago. ““We
started this effort because there is a se-
rious need for help. Because Rock-
bridge County is where I reside. I
wanted to include the people of the
area in this effort.’’ Luciano said.

The festival, which features ten
bands and different types of food, will
begin at noon on Sunday and last all
day. The event will take place in the
Heart of the Forest, a dell that is lo-
cated about 14 miles west of Lexing-
ton on Route 60.

Several groups came together to
make this event happen, students from
Washington and Lee University, Hol-
lins College and Virginia Military In-
stitute offered their time. Luciano says
the bulk of the volunteers are county
residents who agreed this was a good
cause, ‘‘Many people wanted to ex-
tend their hearts and their hands to
make this project work and help those

   

in need,” Luciano said.

Ihe organizers went before the
Rockbridge County Board of Superv-
isors Monday night to secure a permit
for the event. According to Luciano,
they were granted a permit, on the
condition that the rules the county set
forth will be met. He says almost all
of the rules have been met, but the
Supervisors must see proof of this, in
writing, before they actually deliver
the permit.

Through the sale of T-shirts, tickets
and donations, he hopes to raise about
$10,000. The proceeds will go to buy
food, bottled water and building sup-
plies. Luciano says he has arranged
for transportation of the items to Ja-
maica, also ‘‘Many companies have
offered to match whatever is bought
from them.”’ He offered an aluminum
company as an example, “‘However
much aluminum roofing material we
buy from this company, they will
match that amount as a donation.”’

Tickets can be purchased at the
Subway Sandwich Shop for $10 be-
fore the festival or at the festival for
$12. Tickets are two dollars less if
canned goods are donated when tick-
ets are purchased.

Luciano says the festival will be
‘Irie Man!’’ (Loosely translated: a
good time will be had by all!)
