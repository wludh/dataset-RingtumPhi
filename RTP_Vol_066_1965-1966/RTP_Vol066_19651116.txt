| says Kahn, “the author throws in a
lot of ridiculous words and actions,
The scenes don’t follow logically.
The dialogue is short and choppy.”

But although the dialogue is ap-
parently nonsense, Beckett uses it
to present his views of the human
condition, which is humorous, mov-
ing and profound, producing what
the Times of London calls “phrases
that come like a sharp stab of

By JOHN CARRERE

Author David Stacton will present
the second of three lectures tonight
in duPont auditorium at 8:15 p.m.
He will speak on “How Writing Gets
' Written.”

Mr. Stacton was chosen by the
Glasgow Endowment Committee as
its visiting professor for 1965. The
program was started in 1957 by the
will of the late Arthur Graham
Glasgow, a distinguished engineer
and honorary Washington and Lee
alumnus. Mr. Stacton follows such
notables as Katherine Anne Porter
and Robert Penn Warren to the
W&L campus.

Mr. Stacton easily fulfills the
fund's single stipulation to “pro-
mote the art of expression by pen

 

and tongue.” A native of Nevada,
he was born in 1925 and educated
at Stanford and the University of

California at Berkeley. He has pro-
duced in many of the writing forms

including the novel, short stories,
verse, biography, and history
His books include A Ride on a

Tiger (biography), The World on
the Last Day (history), An Unfa-
miliar Country (verse); and (novels)
Delores, A Fox Inside, The Self-
Enchanted, Remember Me, On a Bal-
cony, Segaki, A Dancer in Darkness,
A Signal Victory, The Judges of
the Seeret Court, Tom Fool, Sir Wil-
liam, Laliyuga, and People of the
Book.

Kahn says that “we must have a

He reemphasized the importance of

out that as all students have season

early.

In addition to marking the group’s
debut under Kahn and its first pro-
duction of a full-length Absurdist

Autumn Issue Of Ariel Contains

Student Fiction,

An interview with David Stacton,
four short stories and poetry by
four student writers will appear in
the autumn issue of Ariel, scheduled
for publication before Thanksgiving.

Talk with Stacton

The Stacton interview, by Ariel
editor Grayson Powell, records the
noted author's comments on _ his
career as a novelist and his evalua-
tions of trends in current American
writing.

“Mr. Stacton was very critical of
the frequent occurence of phony
guilt feelings in recent American
fiction,” Powell said, “and he was
equally as enthusiastic about those
writers who, although in a minority,
are in opposition to this trend.”

Fiction

Reviews, Poetry

sists of Jerry Coffman's “Elmo,”
about a college freshman with a very
admirable claim to fame; and Scott
Tappan’s “Rag Doll,” about the in-

“Summer Friends,” about boyhood
companions who outgrow their
friendship; and Frank Q. Jones's
“Into a Dream,” which contains,
among other things, a unique de-
scription of the process of urination.

Local Orchestra Being Organized
By Rockbridge Citizens & Students

A “Rockbridge Chamber Music
Society Orchestra” may become
reality in the Lexington area before
long. This impressive epithet is the
title suggested by Professor Robert
Stewart, head of Washington and
Lee's music department, for a new
group of musicians now being
formed. The primary function of the
group will to provide musical
support for the local production of
the Pirates of Penzance in the spring

However, Stewart hopes that
after the Gilbert and Sullivan play,
the orchestra will continue on a
permanent basis, The spring pro-

be

 

Prof, Robert Stewart

al

duction will serve as a spring-
board for the creation of a local
chamber of music society.

Stewart, who would serve as the
group's director, stated the society
would have several purposes. It
would be an outlet for local talent
people who in Stewart's words “en-
joy playing” could meet periodical-
ly and pursue their common in-
terest in music, The orchestra would
serve as a “musical pool” from which

churches and other organizations
could draw musicians for special
functions. Also, it would give its

members the opportunity of playing

small concertos within the group

Stewart expects to have about
35 members in the society, “Many
people have already expressed a
| great interest,” Stewart said, Musi-
cally inclined townspeople, W&L
and VMI students and faculty, and
local high school students and mu-
sic teachers will be among the
orchestra's members.

Professor Gunn has circulated an
extended summary of the progress
made to date in the Self-Study of
the School of Commerce and Admin-
istration.

In addition to a general distribu-
tion to all members of the faculty
and staff, copies were mailed to
members of the student body execu-
tive committee and to each frater-
nity president, and copies were dis-
tributed to editors of both editions
of the Ring-tum Phi. Also copies
are available to individual students
through Dear. Adams’ office in New-

The summary will provide a basis
for open discussion relative to the
scope and content of the Commerce
School self-study process so far.

Professor Gunn's meetings will be
the first of a series of such discus-
sions aimed at providing an oppor-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition

People in Gien Houses...

The Sunday supplement of the Washington Post contained
a story on the Washington and Lee Department of Journalism
and Communications in which the Ring-tum Phi was the target
of some rather unkind remarks. In the light of the Post’s
usual reputation for factual reporting it is somewhat shocking
to find what amounts to a journalistic diatribe based on sub-
jectivity and departmental prejudice. The offensive comments
as they appeared in the Potomac Magazine were as follows:

Some of its conservatism (Dept. of Journalism) has
spilled over to the sprightly Ring-tum Phi, a twice-a-
week campus publication that is quick to attack policies
of the school president and the laggards of the varsity
football team with equally unabashed and occasionally
unsubstantiated fervor. This publication does not come
under the jurisdiction of the journalism department
which, in the minds of some, is so much the pity.

Mr. Paul Herron, editor of the Post supplement, presum-
edly gathered his information without consulting either editor
of the Ring-tum Phi during his recent campus visit. He ob-
viously relied on the colored opinions of the Department of
Journalism for his evaluation of our newspaper. It is no secret
that the Ried Hall clique has a thoroughly condescending at-
titude toward the journalistic quality of the Ring-tum Phi. It
should be noted at this point, in the same spirit of subjectivity,
that these sentiments are reciprocated in full.

In addition to this oversight in Mr. Herron’s research, we
should like to comment on the validity of his ill-chosen remarks.
The function of a relevant campus newspaper is, as we see it,
to provide a lively and responsible forum for student discussion.
A student publication which merely parrots the platitudes of
the administration or the hackneyed slogans of uninformed
students ceases to render a meaningful contribution to the
University.

There are few, if indeed any, sacred cows on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus—not even the “policies of the President
or the laggards of the football team.” Informed, intelligent,
and responsible criticism is a fundamental element of every
newspaper. The kind of “unabashed fervor” Mr. Herron talks
about is certainly a credit to any newspaper, but the “‘occasion-
ally unsubstantiated fevor” of which he speaks smacks of
subjective judgment which has no place in a reputable journal.

The several inaccuracies in Mr. Herron’s article are further
indication of his carelessness. These include the mis-titling of
the department chairman as a “‘dean,”

sort of quibbling characteristic of exacting editorial appraisal.

Although the Department of Journalism and Communica-
tions may view the Ring-tum Phi as journalistic travesty, it is
apparent that the University has found it wise to leave the
publication of the paper in the hands of students rather than
subject it to the control of a particular department. This in-
dependence assures every student of an opportunity to partici-
pate including those students enrolled in the Department of
Journalism who a are conspicuous by their absence.

W&L gentleman, if he ever really
existed, is obsolete, vestigial, dead.
While the image of the gentleman
is still promoted at W&L his exist-
ance is maintained only by a rear

anachronistic each year. His
existence now serves only to shackle
and hinder education at W&L.
Original Concept of Value
The gentleman must have been
born of our heritage from Robert E.
Lee. The original concept of the
gentleman was probably of value for
Lee was an admirable man. But in
his slow evolution the gentleman has
been blended with other ideas until
today he is a Prostitute.

 

 

The modern W&L gentleman

ap-
pears to be descended from the
Southern Gentleman known earlier

in this century. According to Ralph
McGill in The South and Souther-
ner, “He was a pleasant fellow...,
who cultivated a drawl and empha-
sized good manners. These Southern-
ers made really superior weekend
guests in the twenties. In the roof
gardens, and later in the nightclubs,
they could be very picturesque by
covertly requesting the band to play
‘Dixie’ and then giving the rebel yell
when the galloping swing of it be-
gan. At college they were more often
viewed as charming rather than
bores.”

From Ivan Bunin’s “Gentleman

consciousness. More recently he has
the qualities of the stud.
Our gentleman is now renouned too

Urbane and Witty

The Washington and Lee gentle-
man of today little resem-
blance to the aristocratic intellectual
he pretends to be. He is urbane, wit-
ty, amicable, splendid at cocktails,
and delightful at dinner. He has no
rough edges; he is well-rounded; he

bears

has no salient features to disturb
those he meets. He does not rock the
boat, but he blends beautifully. The

W&L gentleman will take no stands
heed no ealls,

’
champion no causes.
He to flow with the tepid
currents of the status quo.

No W&L gentleman can afford to

ls content

hecome enthusiastic about anything,
for to show fevor or devotion would
be to destroy the placid exterior he

cultivates. He is neither positive nor
negative but is blandly blase.

The W&L gentleman had a place

reserved in the United States of the
1920's. For some life was then a lark.
The nation was prosperous, protect-
ed, isolated and oblivious to those
forces working around it that would
eventually shatter the serenity and
frolicsome frenzy it enjoyed. When
the party was over, the U.S. found
itself involved in and responsible to
the world around it
Image Is Sacred Cow
Te ick the W&L gentleman is
» attack a sacred cow, but a hollow
one; for his most remarkable feature
that he does not exist. The gra-
ciou vell-mannered, Southern
gen nan has disappeared, and his
modern W&L counterpart has gone
too. No fraternity or individual can
lee! maligned if the gentleman is at-
cked cause no example of him
can be found except in our minds.

man i myth, although many are

The student at Washington and

Anthony Leads W&L To Ist CAC Win

Senior Fullback Goes For 173;

Increases Season

By CHARLIE FRERET

Saturday proved to be just a case
of too much John Anthony for
Southwestern as he scored three
touchdowns while gaining 173 yards
on 36 carries. Anthony’s antics led
Washington and Lee to its first con-
ference win of the season—a 26-13
victory over the Lynx.

W&L took the opening kickoff,
but was unable to move. South-
western got the ball on the W&L
40 yard line. Apparently headed for
a score, Southwestern saw its drive
thwarted when Bryant Kendrick in-
tercepted a pass on the end line of
the endzone.

On W&L’s first play following
this interception Anthony fumbled
and Southwestern recovered on
the Generals’s 25 yard line. Once
again Kendrick took matters into
his own hands as he intercepted
another pass on a diving catch,
This interception doubled his total
steals for the year.

A few minutes later safety Larry
Craig took a Lynx punt on his 23
yard line and sped 40 yards down
the sidelines to give W&L a first
down on the Southwestern 37 yard
line. On the next play quarterback
Andy Bloom threw 34 yards to Rob
Reading who was knocked out of
bounds at the 3 yard line. Anthony
then smashed off tackle for the first
of his three touchdowns, and Skip
Jacobsen’s extra point made the
score 7-0.

In the second period Southwestern
put it first points on the scoreboard
Scott Arnold cut behind the
safetyman to take a 40 yard touch-
down pass from quarterback Bruce
Cook. The extra point tied the game
at 7-7.

Rudd Smith took the ensuing kick
and returned it to the 40 yard line.
A Bloom to Smith pass sandwiched
between plunges by Anthony
brought the ball to the 29 yard line.
Three plays later, Anthony brought
the ball to the 29 yard line. Three
plays later, Anthony, having picked
up a first down at the 29 on an off
tackle play, decided to try the left
end of the line and found it to his
liking as he bulled 21 yards into the
end zone. Anthony knocked over
the last two defenders in his path

Again Jacobsen converted and the
score read W&L 14, Southwestern 7.

But Southwestern stormed back
on the strength of Cook’s passing
to put the ball on the W&L 2 yard
line. On the next play halfback
Mike Whitaker crossed the goal
line to cut the W&L lead to one
point. on the try for the extra
point big Jerry Croston managed
to get a hand on the ball to de-
flect it and preserve the Generals’
slim margin. As it turned out,
Croston’s hand was enough to pro-
vide victory.

With 80 seconds left in the half,
Southwestern gained control of the

W&L goal line. Cook sent his big
end Arnold down the sideline, but
Billy Andrews, giving away 9 inches
in height, leaped high in the air to
take the ball out of Arnold’s hands.
Thus, W&L had its 14-13 lead as it
went to the dressing room.

‘oth teams settled down to play some
sturdy defense. Midway through the
| third period W&L gained possession
|near midfield and began to march.
With Anthony’s running and Bloom’s
passing W&L reached the South-
western 15 where on a crucial third
down play Bloom hit Tersh Baker
to give W&L first and goal on the
three. Three runs netted two yards,
but on fourth down Bloom decided
to play the percentages and sent
Anthony off tackle for the touch-
down and a 20-13 lead.

Early in the final quarter
Generals’ offense clicked again
they marched for their fourth and
final seore of the day. Anthony
swept around left end for 16 yards
to the 20 yard line where, hemmed
in, he pitched out to halfback Tom
Pittman who picked up another six
yards to the 14. Anthony carried
again to the seven. The Lynx’s de-
fense, anticipating an Anthony carry,
bunched to stop him, but Bloom
faked to his fullback and flipped a
pass to Baker who had gotten behind

Booters Third In State Tourney;

 

Finish Season With Seven Wins

The Washington and Lee soccer
squad culminated its winning season
this weekend by participating in
the annual state tournament. The
Generals were beaten in the first
round by Randolph-Macon on total
corner kicks in a game ending as
a 0-0 tie, and defeated Virginia Poly-
technic Institute 2-1 in the consola-
tion round.

W&L, seeded second in the state,
played their roughest game of the
season in losing to the Yellow Jackets |
of Randolph-Macon. The deciding |
factor of the tie contest was the op- |
position’s 6-5 lead in corner kicks
after overtime play was completed.
After regulation time the Generals |
had led 5-4 in corner kicks.

Both offense and defense were
well balanced in this game, with
the offense featuring an aggressive,
persistent effort and the defense al-
lowing the Yellow Jackets very few
shots at the W&L goal.

By virtue of this loss; W&L was
pitted against the Gobblers of VPI

 

Saturday night in a_ consolation
game.
By attaining a victory in this

seasonal finale, the Generals closed
their record at 7-3-2.

Fechney tallied the first goal of
the game in the third period. How-
ever, VPI came back in the fourth
quarter to tie the contest. Finally,
in the second overtime period Hen-
ry scored the decisive goal with an
assist by Kirkpatrick. This triumph
left W&L with a third place finish
in the tournament.

As the season ended, Brad Shinkle
and Fred Skinner were named to
lead the 1966 soccer team as captains.
Both of these players have consti-

Cannon Goes 80 Yards Res TD;
Brigadiers Finish With Victory

By MARK EAKER

Washington and Lee’s freshman
football team climaxed one of its
most successful seasons in recent
years with an impressive 13-0 vic-
tory over Staunton Military Aca-
demy Friday. The victory was the
Brigadiers’ fourth of the season
against two defeats. All four of the
victories were won at Wilson Field,
and in each of the games the oppo-
sition failed to score.

The Staunton game proved to be
identical to the three previous home
victories. W&L used a solid defense
to bottle up SMA, and a well-bal-
anced offense to score.

The first W&L touchdown came
late in the second quarter. Quarter-
back Alan Tomlin connected with
halfback Pat Howell for a thirty yard
pass play that took the ball to the
SMA 28 yard line. Then Tomlin ran
out of the pocket, weaving his way

to the one yard line. On the next
play Tomlin took the ball in for the
score and added the point after, giv-
ing W&L a 7-0 lead.

The second half opened with SMA
being unable to move the ball. W&L
took over after a punt on the Gen-
erals twenty. Dee Cannon, with the
explosive running that characterizes
his play, broke through the SMA
line for 80 yards and a touchdown.
Cannon was able to run the distance
because of a picture block by Fran
Lawrence which removed the last
defender from the play. The try for
two points failed, and the score re-
mained at 13-0.

As in previous games the defense
was led by John Wolf, Lawrence,
Britt McJunkin, Don Sharpe, Scott
MacKenzie, and John Harris. The
offense was paced by Tomlin, Can-
non, and Dick Kinney, all stars in
previous weeks, as well as Howell.

The Southern Seminary cheer-
leaders also made the Post in the
sports section. The story was by-
lined for the Associated Press so
perhaps the Semies received some
sort of national coverage. Now every
high school cheer leader in the coun-
try wants to come to ye olde Valley
of Virginia.

Seriously, one has to give the
cheerleaders credit. To stand out
there week after week in front of a
totally unresponsive audience takes
no small amount of nerve.

Barbara Streisand’s newest album
has just been released. It’s entitled,
“My Name Is Barbra, Two. ...,”
and it could be her best. Let listening

to it brings to memory a definite
truism about Barbra. One person
criticized her saying that she occas-
ionally lost her “cools” when she
sang. The reply was, “Man, when
Barbra sings a lot of people loose
their cools.”

Saturday night ended the engage-
ment of “Lord Jim” at one of the
local movie emporiums. Let’s not
concern ourselves with a critique of
the movie and whether Joseph Con-
rad is rolling in his grave. But the
girl. Her name is Daliah Lavi. Is
she or isn’t she the most beautiful
creature ever on the screen or any-
where for that matter.

ODK Should Accept

Here’s hoping that ODK accepts
the Executive Committee’s sugges-
tions for modification and strength-
ening of its Leadership Forum. It
will be an invaluable aid to the BC
and ease its overburdening work
load. More important, it would create
a more easily accessible forum for
debate of campus issues.

The Ring-tum Phi's original story
left the unfortunate impression that
the EC was dictating this change to
ODK. The EC simply does not have
any control over ODK. Despite any
hurt feeling, it is very desirous that
ODK accepts the EC’s suggestions.

for the extra point was unsuccessful,
but W&L had wrapped up the game,
26-13.

Late in the game Southwestern
marched downfield, and Cook
launched a pass at his favorite tar-
get, Arnold. At this point Billy An-
drews stepped in to make a diving
interception at the 10 yard line to
seal W&L’s third victory in 8 games.
