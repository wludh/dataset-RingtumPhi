23 TAPPED AT ODK ASSEMBLY TODAY

ODK Initiates New Forum; Isikoft Appeal

First M eeting

to be Tonight

To Discuss NSA Student Poll

By BILL WILKERSON

The ODK Leadership Forum has
been reorganized and will hold its
first meeting tonight. The meeting
will be held in Lee Chapel at 7:30.

Tonight’s program is a debate on
the advisibility of W&L’s affiliating
with the National Student Associa-
tion. A student poll on this matter
is to be held this Friday.

The purpose of the Leadership
Forum is to provide student lead-
ers with a place and time to ex-
change ideas and opinions on topics
of concern among the student body.

The debate tonight will
formal one, but questions from the
floor will be considered at the close
of the debate.

be a

The speakers in favor of NSA
will be Jim Johnson and Joyce
Riddle. Mr. Johnson is National

Vice-president of NSA. Miss Riddle
is the president of the student gov-
ernment Hollins College. Her
opinions appeared in last Saturday’s
Ring-tum Phi.

Opposing these speakers will be
Tom Tauken and another girl from

‘
ab

Hollins College. Mr. Pauken is at
present College Director for the

Young Republican National Federa-
tion.

Fred Mindel said that the debate
should present some excellent argu-
ments on the question of NSA and
on the conservative versus liberal is-
sue as a whole.

The new structure of the Leader-
ship Forum is to include a Forum
and a Council. The Forum will be
open to anyone while the Council
will be composed of 14 selected cam-
pus leaders.

The Forum will include the presi-
dents of each of the undergraduate
and law school classes, 2 represen-
tative from the Executive Commit-
tee, the president, vice-president,
and a representative from the Inde-
pendent Union.

The Forum will meet whenever an
issue of significant concern to the
students comes up on campus.

Following the meeting the Coun-
cil of the ODK Leadership Forum
will meet to draw up a resolution on
the basis of the night's discussion.

 

 

A large turnout is expected for
this evening’s meeting. The issues
to be discussed will have a direct
effect on the outcome of the EC
poll concerning this matter on Fri-
day. All students are urged to par-
ticipate in this first campus-wide
ODK experiment.

Chuck Walker, president of Alpha
circle of ODK, expressed his hope
that the concept of the forum would
be well received and that students
would feel free to participate in the
discussions. In addition, Walker stat-
ed that other pertinent issues which
may arise during the year should
be brought to the attention of the
Council.

Junkin Works |
Are Displayed
In duPont Hall

A retrospective show of the works
of artist Marion Junkin, professor of
fine arts at Washington and Lee
University, will be on display this
month in duPont Hall Art Gallery.

The show will feature primarily
oils, with some water colors and
sculpture by Junkin, who has served

To EC Denied
At Meeting, 6-5

By GEORGE A. MORGAN
Staff Reporter

After a meeting last night which
lasted more than three hours, the
Executive Committee refused to res-
cind the social probation meted out
to sophomore Mickey Isikoff for re-
peated violations of conventional
dress. The vote was 6-5, with Presi-
dent Fred Mindel not voting.

Isikoff said that he realized that
he was guilty, but that he felt the
penalty was too severe. He further
stated that those assimilating him
were doing it as a joke, or out of
malice. Isikoff indicated his intention
to take his case to whole student
body if his appeal failed.

Summarizing the Affair

Mindel listed several points which
had to be considered in the Isikoff
ease: the penalty was more severe
than those handed down for Cold
Check and Siudent Control Commit-
tee violations; the penalty was not
previously specified; there is no
precedent for the penalty; and, the
vindictivenes of the assimilators.

Other persons appeared at the
meeting in Isikoff’s behalf, includ-
ing seniors Nick Ruffin and Bruce
Kramer.

Charles Phillips
Delivers Speech
At O D K Day

Omicron Delta Kappa, nation-
al leadership fraternity, today
took in twenty-three new mem-
bers in the annual tapping cer-
emonies. Washington and Lee

chapter president, Chuck
Walker presided as three alumni
four law students, eleven seniors
and five juniors were named for

membership. Dr. Charles F. Phillips,
president of Bates College, gave the
annual address. A banquet in Evans
Dining Hall for old and new mem-
bers followed the assembly.

ODK was founded at Washington
and Lee in 1914 for the purpose of
“bringing together campus leaders
in a more relaxed atmosphere.”
Membership is extended to students
ranking in the upper 35 per cent
of their class who have made sig-
nificant contributions in the field of
scholarship, athletics, publications,
social and religious affairs, speech,
music, and dramatic arts.

Dr. Phillips, graduate of Colgate
University and Harvard Graduate
School is widely known as a speak-
er on educational and economic de-
velopments. He serves as a director
of the Central Main Power Company,
the Union Mutual Life Insurance
Company and others. Full particu-
lars of his speech will be covered
in the Friday Ring-tum Phi.

Those tapped were as follows:

Feet Of Clay

A news story which appeared in last Friday’s paper con-

cerning the Isikoff case grossly

misrepresented a statement by

student body president Fred Mindel. Although the error was
unintentional we want to make it perfectly clear that Mr. Min-

del does not view the abolition

of conventional dress as a dis-

tinct probability nor does he advocate any measure designed to
lessen the effectiveness of this tradition in our community.

We are constantly appalled by the efforts of certain ele-
ments of this student body to equate the existence of the As-
similation Committee with the maintenance of conventional
dress. There is certainly no evidence correlating the Assimila-
tion Committee with a high degree of conformity to our code
of dress. In fact there is increasing evidence from the last few
years that the Committee’s continued existence is a hindrance.

It is extremely difficult, if notimposisble, logically to im-

pose conventional dress on the

student body by means of an

enforcement committee with the power to fine or levy social
restrictions. At the risk of being repetitious, we wish to state
emphatically that a tradition is supported and enforced by the
cooperation of the majority exercising social controls, not a
small, vindictive and perhaps hypocritical group of students

doling out fines.

The editorial in last Friday’s edition is particularly lament-

able because it simply failed to deal with the current issue, i.e.

whether there is any correlation

between the Assimilation Com-

mittee and the maintenance of conventional dress. The issue
does not “hinge on whether conventional dress has a significant
value today;” we concede this point.

We would hope that our distinctive position among the
institutions of this country has a broader appeal and that
those students who honestly question the validity of an Assimi-
lation Committee are not guilty of “undermining W&L’s great-

est asset and distinction.”

If the maintenance of conventional dress is all that dis-
tinguishes Washington and Lee from “hundreds of nearly
similar schools,” then indeed, the idol has clay feet.

 

The Life You Save...

The problem of students being mugged in the streets of
Lexington is one with which all members of the University
community are concerned. If a student is assaulted and fails
to report the incident and swear out a complaint, he endangers
the well-being of all other students. If the assailants are not ar-
rested or even accused, it is almost assured that more students
will be attacked. We strongly urge all students who are attacked
to report immediately to the Lexington police, so this epidemic

of muggings can be stopped.

We wish to correct the statement in last week’s editorial,

entitled “An Armed Camp?”,

that the administration is un-

concerned and inactive in regard to these attacks. Meetings
with University Proctor Bob Murray have been held by the
Administration almost daily since these latest incidents started.
It is the desire of the Administration that students who are
attacked cooperate with them in their efforts to stop these
muggings by reporting to the police, as stated above.

Any students who think that they can effectively deal with
the problem by arming themselves should leave their guns
in the closet. If a student is attacked by fists, he may not shoot
his assailant and hope to avoid presecution himself. Concealed

weapons, moreover, are illegal.

Any students currently playing roles out of Ian Fleming

are urged to disarm themselves

at once, before they are pun-

ished with even greater severity than would be meted out to

oven the most brutal townie thug.

The Constructive Uses of Traditions

By JOHN M. GUNN, JR.
Assistant Professor of Economics
Mere tradition is a vain inherit-

ance. Striving to maintain a tradi-
tion for tradition’s sake is wasted
effort. Putting on a tradition in
an attempt to clothe itself in the
prestige of old age may sap a com-
munity of much of its vitality,

On the other hand, when tradi-
tions can help a community toward
larger achievement of its own critical
examined objectives, those traditions
are worth preserving, especially if
the community be one of young per-
sonalities who are achieving their
own maturity.

I believe that thousands of Wash-
ington and Lee men have been heirs
to real and worth benefits, conferred
upon them, in part, through the
medium of tradition.

The Honor System stands apart
as an ennobling tradition. Here I will

 

write no more of it than to say that
judged from the limits of my ex-
perience and according to my stand-
ards of value, the Washington and
Lee Honor System is the most out-
standing single feature of this, or
any other, educational institution—
a marvelous engine for the develop-
ment of integrity and responsibility
in all who are associated with the
University. It takes a while for fresh-
man students and new faculty mem-
bers to appreciate its force and
depth, and some doubtless miss its
lessons altogether. However, most
members of the University are in-
fluenced by it; and some have their
lives literally transformed through
the experience of living under the
Honor System.

On a different level are several
other traditions of the University
whose constructive benefits have
been less essential but nonetheless

Montgomery Probes Facts |
Of Mickey Isikoff A {fair

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
Mickey Isikoff is a ZBT sopho-
more to whom the Executive Com-
mittee has given
four weeks of so-
cial probation for
repeatedly wear-
ing non-conven-
tional dress. The
known objective
facts of the case
are that Isikoff was
twice sent before
the Assimilation
Committee for

Montgomery sent to the E.C
because he persisted in his ways
The most pertinent aspects of the
case have yet to be presented, how-
The salient features of the
Isikoff case are: (1) Mickey Isikoff
neither expected nor had any rea-
son to expect the severity of the
penality meted out to him: (2) of
all the blatantly sloppy dressers on
campus, Isikoff alone has received
strong punishment; and (3) there is
strong reason to believe that Isikoff
has been the target of a small group

I believe that the E.C. cannot be
accused of inequity, except inso-
far as the questionable severity of
the punishment is concerned. The
Executive Committe definitely had to
punish Isikoff,

Can Mickey Isikoff blamed?
Yes, to the extent that he was guilty
of violating conventional dress, and
to that extent he deserved being dis-
ciplined. But if Mickey was to be
punished, he should have been giv-
en to expect that the discipline might
be severe. He was not, of course,
because no one on campus expected
such severity. Furthermore, if Mick-

real: gentlemanly behavior, — the
friendly greetings, and conventional
dress. No instant traditions, these.
All have lives a century old, or
older. The aggregate effect of num-
erous decisions by individuals within
the next several weeks may de-
termine whether some or all of these
traditions will continue in this Uni-
versity.
Gentlemanly Behavior

H. W. Fowler describes “genteel”
as a word now used only by the ig-
norant, except in mockery—a “wor-
sened word,” in its fit phrase. If that
be so, our language is the poorer for
the change, and our lives are poorer
for the worsened behavior that seems
to have accompanied the deprecia-
tion of the word.

When President Lee laid down his
“one rule here,” “To be a gentleman”
was understood to encompass a man’s
total behavior. It did not then imply
effectation of a detached smoothness
while indulging one’s sensous tastes.
It did not give young men leave to
sow a few patches of wild oats, even
if sown with a measure of delicacy,
or at least, of discretion. It did not
depend upon affluence, and it did not
exclude hard work.

It DID imply respect for the rights,
the opinions, and the sensitivities of
others. It DID involve the SPIRIT, as
well as the practice, of courtesy. It
DID demand respect for law and
established authority, including both
civil and institutional authority.

However, it did not inhibit honest!

disagreement or respectful criticism
of authority, and it would not ex-
clude civil disobedience in a sincere
cause of justice. At its best, the con-
cept of gentlemanly behavior re-
quired nobility and generosity in a
man’s total behavior.

No one expects that college stu-
dents will never offend. To do so
would be to mistake their role
students. One may
same student will not offend too
often, in total, nor repeatedly in the
same offense. And one must reject

as

hope that the|

 

the current willingness to excuse
almost any degree of ecrudity of be-
havior. or even of injury to others,
by saying, “Well, he was drunk.” If
a man loses his self-control after a
“couple of drinks,” he has a good
reason not to drink; he has no ex-
cuse to behave in an ungentlemanly
manner,

Although the tradition of gentle-
manly behavior has not been a sub-
ject of active controversy, I believe
its deterioration has been as markd
as the decline of the custom of ex-
changing the friendly greeting or
the erosion of conventional dress.
Moreover, it may well be that these
coincident declines are casually re-
lated.

Greeting, Conventional Dress

“Hi, Gentlemen” will neither en-
hance your appreciation of the gen-
ius of Goethe nor help the South
become a biracial community at
peace with itself. Merely by saying

Kline Urges Assimilation
Committee Strengthening

By JODY KLINE

The current debate over the
dition of conventional dress has been
confused by the fact that some peo-
ple are arguing about the degener-
acy of a students while others are
questioning the effectiveness of the
Assimilation Committee, and up un-
. , til now there has

tra-

been no accurate
investigation to
determine if the

latter agency has
been the cause of
a weakened em-
phasis on conven-
tional dress.

At the Execu-
tive Committee
meeting of Feb-
ruary 21, student
body president Fred Mindel stated
that there were three possible
courses of action regarding the status
quo of the Assimilation Committee
1) It could be left as it is at present
2) It could be abolished. 3) It could
be reinvested with fining powers.

Now what will probably happen in
each of these cases.

If the Assimilation Committee is
left the way it is now- student dress-
ing habits will remain the way they
now, or even worse, will con-
tinue to degenerate at the at
which they have been for the past
several years

Questions

Secondly, if the Assimilation Com-
mittee is abolished can we actually
expect an improvement in conven-
tional dress? How many students at
Wa&L intentionally

protest against rules that supposedly
constrain his individuality? But how

these customs can help mobilize
one’s effors for effective study.
Hence, the well-tied tie and the
well-spoken salute may help en-
large one’s appreciation of Goethe
or his knowledge of interstellar space
after all. Such feedback from dress
and manners to narrowly defined
“academic” performance is probably
small, but there is significant evi-
dence that it is often real. The con-
tribution to self-esteem and self-
confidence is, itself, of more funda-
mental importance.

Wearing a necktie is neither a
necessary condition, nor a sufficient
one, to neatness in dress; indeed,
some students are able to wear ties
in a manner that proclaims defiance
of neatness. However, wearing a coat,
a tie, and a pair of socks, DOES
have the advantage of being opera-
tionally easy to classify, whereas
“neatness” is subject to difficulty in

ultimate, the maximum authority
conceivable to punish violators.

Honor System

Now I suppose that one time the
Honor System was also criticized and
students claimed that expulsion from
the university was too harsh a pun-
itive action. But students began to
realize the responsibility that the
Honor System placed on them and
slowly the violations became less
frequent, and when they did oc-
cur were considered a breach of a
very important student obligation.

In this way the Honor System
evolved from a set of regulations
into an expected mode of be-
havior. At this point students no
longer obeyed the Honor System
because of fear but because it ques-
tioned their sense of responsibility
and maturity—it became at that time
a tradition.

Return to Fines

I suggest that the idea of con-
ventional dress can be developed in
the same way. With re-established
fining powers, the Assimilation Com-
mittee can halt the decline of stu-
dent dress habits, providing that the
students take an increased interested
in their university and become more
conscious of violators of the dress
regulations.

At the same time the Assimila-
tion Committee can spend more time
inculeating the freshman with the
idea of conventional dress as a tra-
dition rather than a habit that
we have all conformed to.

This program, I feel, should should
bring about the development of con-
ventional dress as a tradition equal
in acceptance to the Honor System
within a period of a few years.

167 lb. was pinned in the third
period of his match. Hugh Baugher,
177 lb. followed but trailed his
opponent by a near fall, bringing
the score to 36-0 for U.Va.

Raker Wins

Well, with one match to go the
pride of W&L rested solely on
Homes Raker, wrestling heavy-
weight.. Homes came through and
easily took the five points from
U.Va. bringing the final score to
36-5.

On the whole, this season has
been a fair one for the 65-66 wrest-
ling team. The seniors ended up well,
winning most of their matches. The
majority of the rest of the team,
and a good part of the Junior Var-
sity consists of freshmen. With a
bit more experience, these boys will
probably lead the team to many
good seasons in the future.

 

Examines Dress;

interpretation. In fact, the tradition
of Conventional Dress has usually
accomplished a high degree of neat-
ness in the appearance of W&L
men, both individually and collec-
tively. It is an appearance that is in
marked contrast to the dirty Tee-
shirts, which are the conventional
dress of many colleges, or the dirty
chinos, which are the conventional
dress of others.

In addition to the salutary effects
on individual students, shared tra-
ditions have contributed much to a
spirit of unity in the Washington
and Lee Student Body, the Faculty,
and the Alumni of the University.
The speaking tradition, especially,
has helped make real the advertised
benefits of a small student body, and
it has served to expand the range
of a student’s friendships.

Whatever its other values, or lack

of value, the exchange of greetings
has been a practice that warmed the
heart.
The constructive traditions of
Washington and Lee have brought
tangible benefits to its students, quite
apart from their aid in developing
the character of the individual. These
traditions have helped students de-
velop the personal qualities that can
make their technical competence
more effective in advancing their
own interests and the interests of so-
ciety. They have been a major at-
traction in the University’s efforts
to enroll good students, in compe-
tition with other recognized institu-
tions. They have assisted in attract-
ing to the University strong addi-
tions to the faculty. The traditions,
and the goals they seek to advance,
have contributed to a bond between
Faculty and University which has
held at Washington and Lee some
Faculty members, including some
of those admired most by students,
who have received offers from more
prestigious institutions, at higher
salaries than they were paid here.

The appearance and behavior of
W&L students have prompted com-
ment from almost all those who
have visited the campus to interview
applicants for graduate and profes-
sional schools and for employment.
While one would hope admission
to the leading graduate schools and
employment by dynamic corporations
would be determined by things more
fundamental than the style of a
man’s dress, there is no doubt that
W&L men have been favored in
their applications by the distinctions
recruiters have observed between
this campus and most others.

Almost all students want this Uni-
versity to be distinctive. It is an
ironic fact that many would forfeit
the very things that have given it
distinction, rather than make the
small effort needed in adjusting their
personal habits to maintain the high
standards of the past.

If traditions seeking to promote
gentility and graciousness were pro-
posed as substitutes for integrity
and responsibility, intellectual vi-
tality, and scholarly evcellence, such
exchange would be a poor bargain.
The leadership of the University has
never contemplated such substitu-
tion, however, and I think these tra-
ditions have not distracted from the
University's primary objectives, even
unconsciously. Rather, the traditions
of gentlemanly behavior (according
to Lee's conception of it), of courtesy
on the campus, and of high standards
in personal appearance have been
esteemed as complements of good
academic performance, contributing

that primary goal, and enhancing in
total the value of a man’s collegiate
experience.

The late President Gaines, who
set for Washington and Lee the
objective of developing in its stu-
dents “something a little finer than
competence,” once said that a meas-
ure of the intangibles that distin-
guish superior colleges and univer-
sities is the force of their construc-
tive traditions, Washington and Lee
has had few peers in exhibiting
such force, Will the University pre-
serve its exceptional “intangibles”?

for having had an ancestor in the re-
mote past who was an oligarch. If
“aristocracy” can be attained as
easily as wearing a strip of cloth
around one’s neck, and a hypocriti-
cal smile on one’s mug, it certainly
can not be too far above the “mass of
common  non-conformism.” What
heritage is there in a white collar,
when any delivery boy can wear one,
when anyone can ape “gentlemanly
deportment?”
A Personal View

Personally, I'm going to continue,

poll or not, to wear, of my own

 

 

choice, a coat and/or tie to classes
and a couple other places. I could
care less what anyone else does or
does not do. When I meet a person, I
try not to judge him by his clothes
or facial expression or small-talk,
but to accept him as an individual
apart from any standards of “gentle-
manliness” which my social class has
tried to establish. If in doing so I
descend into the clutches of the red
international anti-tie conspiracy,
that’s my problem, and I'll accept
the consequences, however horrible
they may be.

Yours,

“Well ...some, I believe, have said
that we might have a more...a
more aggressive policy in the area
of integration.”

“We do have an aggressive policy.
Surely we do. As you know, we go
to high schools all over the South to
tell boys about Washington and Lee.
And some of these high schools are
integrated.”

“Do you make a special effort to
talk to Negroes at these high
schools?”

“Well, no. But we do let them
listen along with the white boys. We
don't plug up their ears or send
them out of the room.”

“That's aggressive?”

“We like to think so.”

“Some people have said that if
Washington and Lee wants to be a
leader in Southern education we
should work hard to integrate the
student body.”

“Who wants to be a leader in
Southern education? Why change
our traditional role?”

“I guess you're right.”

About this time I had finished my
swell cup of coffee. I made my way
out of the Co-op toward the scenic
campus of Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, happy that our administra-
tion was in such capable hands, and
happy that all was white with God's
world.

Muggings Arouse Concern
(Continued from Page 1)

The recent rash of mugging began
last January 11 when three W&L
students, Richard Noblett, Anderson
Smith, and Val MeWhorter, were
attacked near Doe’s Grill at 10:45
p.m. In this case six youth were
found guilty, fined, and given sus-
pended jail sentences.

When asked about these incidents,
Bob Murray, the University Proctor,
said, “We're going to throw the book
at these two and show all of them
that they can’t get away with this
kind of thing. It’s the only way to
stop it.”

Isikoff Implications

to the Assimilation Committee its
fining power and discretion, or abol-
ish the committee altogether. I cer-
tainly hope that we will choose the
former, for if we abolish the en-
forcement of conventional dress, we
will have also irreparably weakened
the tradition. In ending enforcement,
we will substitute individual prefer-
ence in dress for a concrete and
enforceable consensus... and a tra-
dition ceases to exist if it ceases to
be a consensus.

Let us hope that in the forthcom-
ing poll on the Assimilation Comi-
mittee, the student body will both
prevent further Isikoff-type inequi-
ties and strengthen our conventional
dress tradition by voting to return
the Assimilation Committee's fining
and discretionary powers.
