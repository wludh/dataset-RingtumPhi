ert E. R. Huntley, the Self-Study
analyst.

This Wednesday, as a prelude to

the forthcoming report, Prof, Hunt-
ley will conduct open meetings with
faculty members and students on
faculty matters which have bearing
on the Self-Study project.

These meetings will be

Teachers Plan
Institutes Here
During Summer

French and ads Dept.
To Sponsor Secondary
High School Program

By WAYNE SUNDAY

Normally, the Washington and Lee
University campus during the sum-
mer months is fairly deserted after

the students, and the faculty
make their annual mass exodus in
June.

But this summer the campus will
be—by comparison with past sum-
mers—alive with activity. Besides
the usual 30-40 students in the Law
School summer session, there will be
80 secondary school teachers enrol-
led in two summer institutes.

And there will be approximately
20 Lexington area high school stu-
dents taking part in a special “dem-
onstration class” during one of the
institutes.

Fifty of the secondary school
teachers will attend an NDEA In-
stitute in French. The other 30 will
take part in a summer institute in
geology sponsored by the National
Science Foundation.

Both institutes will begin June 20.

The geology session will last six
weeks until July 29; the French in-
stitute will continue another two

weeks until Aug. 12.

By STEVE SAUNDERS
News Editor

CONTACT ’66 received a weighty endorsement from the
We&L student body, as revealed in an unannounced Ring-tum
Phi poll taken yesterday. The poll showed that 61.3% of the
student body had participated in the weekend’s activities, and

that 83%

favored continuation of the program in future years.

Of Journalists

Sigma Delta Chi Endorses
State Recommendation

To End Censorship

Six journalists and one profession-
al journalists are scheduled to be ini-

tiated into Sigma Delta Chi in a
ceremony here tentatively set for
March 15.

Identity of the students and the

newsman will be made known when
the board of directors of the national
professional journalistic society acts
on the nominations made by the lo-
cal chapter, Mauriece Fliess, chapter
president, said this week.

The chapter during 1965-66 has
held receptions for two visiting
journalists who lectured on cam-
pus, instituted a fund to provide
more books for the journalism de-
partmental library, and planned a
photographic exhibit for the Reid
Hall foyer.

It also endorsed a recommendation
made by retiring Virginia Gov. Al-
bertis S. Harrison, Jr., that the state
legislature abolish the Virginia Mo-
tion Picture Censorship Board. At
the chapter's February meeting, mo-
del laws proving for open meetings
and open records in localities were
approved to be sent to area members
of the Virginia General Assembly for
consideration, as was the resolution
opposing film censorship.

The chapter will assist in the
planning and duties involved in
the Southern Interscholastic Press

Association convention which will be

held at W&L April 29-30

516 Students Polled

Five-hundred sixteen _ students
were polled, at least one-third of
whom were freshmen. Canvassers

were stationed throughout the day
at Washington Hall and the fresh-
man Quad, and in the Commons
during the midday meal.

Of those who attended lectures,
the largest group (30.6%) attended
only one. Those attending two lec-
tures made up 28.7% of the group
questioned; 22% attended three lec-
tures; 11.2% were at four lectures;
and only 7.4% participated in all
five.

Brown Next Best

Harrington was the overwhelming
favorite for top speaker with 63%.
Claude Brown was next with 17.6%,
followed closely by Dr. Ernest Van
den Haag who received 17.5% of the
votes. Dr. Jay T. Wright and Ber-
nard E. Norwitch were tied with
each receiving 1.2%.

Only fourteen students (3%)
thought that CONTACT should be
discontinued. Fourteen per cent had
no opinion. Three of those who vot-
ed to abolish CONTACT did not at-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

Praise For CONTACT

Editorial note:

(The following article appeared in the Sunday New York
Herald Tribune and is reprinted in full. The Ring-tum Phi
believes that the content of this column provides a more than
adequate tribute to CONTACT. We do, however, wish to add
our congratulations to the members of the steering committee
for an outstanding achievement. Since this year’s program
profited from the mistakes of the first venture, we can antici-
pate conitinued success for the IFC’s intellectual symposium.)

 

Perhaps the competitiveness and the status-hunger of the
American middle class will produce a new generation of college-
educated idealists.

This notion is not occasioned by a visit to Berkeley or Ann
Arbor, or some other vanquished center of student revolt and
new leftism.

It was evoked by a visit to Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. I spoke there in an historic chapel, holding forth on the
miseries of American society from a rostrum located almost
directly over the crpyt of Gen. Robert E. Lee. Washington and
Lee is not an intensely political school: it has no chapter of
Students for a Democratic Society, no organized anti-war pro-
test movement, and, for that matter its only activity on Viet
Nam was the gathering of a petition in favor of President
Johnson’s position. It is an institution with roots going back
into American life as far back as 1747, the students tend to
come from well-off families, and it has even had its association
with the Southern gentleman conception of what a college
should be.

And yet there was a warm, even enthusiastic, response to
my advocacy of a guaranteed annual income, massive multi-
billion-dollar investments in low-cost housing and other ex-
penditures in the social sector. They even greeted my call for
a redefinition of work in American Society. And the speaker
whom the students have invited to conclude this week’s lecture
series is Claude Brown, the author of “Manchild in the Prom-
ised Land,” a graduate of the Harlem streets and New York
State juvenile correctional system. If my remarks gave the Lee
crypt a spin or two, I should imagine that Brown’s presence
would turn the Confederate general’s shade into a whirling
dervish.

It is the most recent article of faith in the technologically
revolutionary society that a good education is the key to a young
person’s future. For the middle class, the rat race now begins
at the nursery school, which determines access to a good grade
school, and the latter is a key to a fine high school, which in
turn prepares the young scholar for his first-rate college and
professional or graduate school, and finally all the travail pro-
duces, not such a diploma, but a credit card. All of this can
have cruel consequences for the young, and it is, of course,
a perversion of the very meaning of learning. Yet, because of
this new status hysteria, today’s college student is often brighter,
better-prepared—and ready to become critical of the very
parental values which drove him into the world of ideas as if
it were a market place.

A minority of these students become active rebels, They
tend to be the brightest young men and women at the best col-
leges and universities (the surest sign of academic quality I
know of is the presence of a large group of radicals: e.g., the
Ivy League and the top state schools are disproportionately
represented in the jails of Mississippi and the peace marches).
But another, less dramatic expression of the same trend is the
vast increase in the number of students who, though not radical
activists, are critical of the status quo, suspicious of precisely
those money-and-status-dominated values that education was
supposed to confirm in them.

I do not want to over-praise all this, for there are obviously
profound things wrong with higher education in America, to
day. For one thing, it is, as the Berkeley students brilliantly
pointed out, quite often bureaucratic, technocratic and even
anti-intellectual. For or another, the middle class is devoting so
much private and public money and so much anguish to the
schools in order to preserve radical and class distinctions
and to be sure their children keep well ahead of the poor. And
yet there is reason for some optimism in the fact that the ac-
complishment of these base purposes requires that young peo-
ple be exposed to the dangers of thinking. It is a risky situation
when a society has become so complex that you have to insist
that the middle-class youth be serious and subject themselves
to ideas. It was thus for Stover of Yale, or even Andy Hardy.
The result could be a new political source of support for liberal,
and even radical, social reform which, I suspect, is not exactly
what the proud parents thought they were buying in the knowl-
edge shop.

So I remain, Gen. Lee, your disobedient but grateful
Signed, Michael Harrington

A Mistaken Impression?

The attendance at last week's Self-Study meeting on the
library was particularly encouraging. Although the discussion
was lively and constructive, there was some question as to
the spirit in which it was received. It appeared that a number
of significant inquiries were dismissed as impractical or, at best,

servant.

worthy of limited consideration. We hope that this impression |
was a mistaken one, and that future action by this committee |

will incorporate the suggestions and proposals which were pre

sented at the meeting.

By BRUCE W. RIDER
As I was starting through my stacks
of fan mail not long ago, I noticed
that many people wrote to ask why
there was not a column by cute me
last Tuesday.

What the situation is, friends, is
that I and my fellow classmates are
Second Semester Seniors, a danger-
ous and unsettled breed.

By this time in our college careers
we have either done well enough to
get into a good graduate school or
get a good job—or we have not. Dur-
ing the past seven semesters either

 

we have proved ourselves—or we
have not. Therefore the slogan of the
Second Semester Senior: What the
hell.

So—it is possible that any senior
may or may not have a column ap-
pearing regularly, Or have the news-
paper appear regularly. Or the senior
himself may not appear regularly.
Bear with us, then, friends, readers,
and be glad and happy when you
see or hear from us at all.

Proper Planning

studies properly, he is taking note of

At last Roanoke has been sup-
plied with an appreciable form of
entertainment. A new dinner thea-
tre, featuring a “magic stage” in the
round, has recently opened on the
airport road off Route 119 (only five
minutes from Hollins).

Rustic Atmosphere

The Barn Dinner Theatre provides
an excellent buffet dinner (with
set-ups) served in a rustic atmos-
phere, in addition to a professional-
ly acted show produced and direct-
ed in New York by Howard D.
Wolfe Productions.

Operating on a year-round sched-
ule, the Barn is the only Dinner
Theatre of its type in Roanoke and
the surrounding. The Barn’s
policy is to produce a play for a pe-
riod of four weeks, Tuesday through
Sunday of each week.

Professional Cast

Each production features a pro-
fessionally-trained cast whose mem-
bers have received extensive dra-
matic experience in various Broad-
way and Repertory Companies.

Presently, Mr. Wolfe. the Execu-
tive Producer ,has five other dinner
theatres in Richmond, Greensboro,
Atlanta, Charlotte, and Raleigh-
Durham. Each production tours all

New Barn Dinner Theatre
Brings Drama To Roanoke

six cities allowing a new show to
appear every month. Future plans
call for establishing a coast to coast
network of dinner theatres.

New Idea

The importance of this operation
is that in American cities the size of
Roanoke, there is a surprising lack
of permanent performing institu-
tions, especially in the South and
Mid-West. Mr. Wolfe's efforts prom-
ise to bring a new idea in profes-
sional repertory to these regions.

Having just concluded a fine per-
formance of “Sunday in New York,”
directed by Johnathan Bolt, the
Barn has recently opened “Will Suc-
cess Spoil Rock Hunter.” Future
productions will include “Bus Stop,”
“The Importance of Being Earnest,”
“Shot in the Dark,” and “Picnic.”

Reservations

Reservations may be made by
calling the Box office in Roanoke
(362-3333) between the hours of
9:00 am. and 11:00 p.m. The gour-
met dinner is served at 7:00 p.m.
and is followed by the play which
begins at 8:30 p.m,

The Barn reserves Monday eve-
nings for special productions for
groups and private parties.

Seniors to Glide into Last Stretch

any significance in this his last col-
lege semester. And he takes no
course that (or which) meets
before ten-fifteen, and surely he will
not take a course meeting in the
sunny afternoon. Hoepfully, he is in
the Honors Program, which means
no classes at all but one hell of a
busy April when he has to concoct
a thesis.

This second semester of my sen-
ior year I am taking five courses
which (or that) will enable me to
get the highest possible grades at
the lowest possible cost to my val-
uable health and time.

My first course, which meets on
alternate rainy Monday afteroons, is
Commerce 808, “How to Get and
Hold an Easy Job.” This is related to
another course I’m taking, in Ac-
counting, “How to Fool the Audi-
tors and Buy Them Off it Neces-
sary.”

Art, of couse, is something we all
should be acquainted with, so Fine
Arts 24450, “Big and Fleshy Nudes”
fits nicely into the schedule.

Enduring Meaning

Our education, as we all know,
will continue As Through This
World We Wend Our Way, so I am
enrolled in Comparative Literature
902, “The Study and Use of Read-
er’s Digest Condensed Books.”

Some of the more intellectual
seniors are taking Comparative Lit-
erature 904, “Intensive Reading in
the Book of the Month Club Selec-
tions,” but why push yourself.

I have always been told that psy-
chology would be of value in later
life (whatever that is) thus I am
taking. “The Care, Study and Fool-
ing Around With White Rats.” If I
ever meet up with a white
some day I will surely know how
to deal with him and understand his
psychological problems.

Prospective Alumnus

In the dark recesses of every sen-
ior’s mind is the knowledge that be-
ginning in June he will be an Alum-
nus. A thrilling thought.

(“Alumnus,” by the way, is a Latin
word meaning “short, fat, and some-
what dull.”)

Only when we are Alumn, of
course, will we be able to express
ourselves intelligently concerning
matters of the University. When we
have been in lowa or Texas for ten
or twenty years with nary a visit
to Lexington we will be able at last
to see clearly how things are and
how things should be at our fair
campus.

So—be kind to your Valentines
and show mercy for us Second Se-
mester Seniors. We need all the help
we can get.

 

 

Rush Booklets

Are Necessary

The Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University
Dear Editor,

The recent IFC proposal to incor-
porate all fraternity rush booklets
into one massive volume would do
great damage to many fraternities at
Washington and Lee.

The individual rush booklet en-
ables every fraternity to present
something which makes that frater-
nity unique from others at W&L.
In a single booklet a rush chairman
is able to emphasize this unique-
ness as much as he wants. This
would be impossible to do in a large
book, where his fraternity can only
be but one chapter in eighteen. Most
fraternity men feel that their house
has something special and should not
be looked at merely as another fra-
ternity in a polygot of sigmas kap-
pas, and taus.

Houses with a small national
name have a chance to assert their
own strengths in the single rush
booklet. In a large rush manuel
these houses would not receive the
same interest that the “big time”
fraternities would.

The different foremat which each
rush manual adopts (the Delt news-
paper, the DU “Time Magazine,”
ete.) make the individual rush book-
lets considerable more interesting to
the incoming freshman than one gi-
gantic book where each house has a
limited space to fill.

Finally, there is a most important
argument to consider. Most fraterni-
ty men feel that money spent on
rush booklets is well spent. They
should have the choice of pursuing
rush as they see fit within the Rush
Rules. And rush booklets certainly
are still in the rules.

Lastly, many house have little or
no contact with their alumni
throughout the year. The only
way that they can keep their alum-
ni posted on the progress of their
fraternity (without publishing ex-
pensive alumni letters) is through
the mailing of rush booklets. If
these rush boklets are abolished,
then the school will have lost a
valuable source of alumni contact.

Hopefully, fraternities will con-
sider this matter closely at the next
IFC meeting. It is worthy of their
attention,

Sincerely
ANDREW N. BAUR

 

Contact Achieves Unity
And Wider Participation

By NICK RUFFIN

Last year the Contact symposium
was a success only in the sense that
there had never been a symposium
at Washington and Lee before, and
that to have one at all was an im-
provement over the previous situa-
tion. This year mere existence could
not decide the worth of Contact. The
program improved to achieve an
excellence which his remarkable in
comparison to last year’s effort. Con-
tact had a unity in which the five
speakers supported challenged and
expanded each other's ideas, so that
the whole was surely greater than
the sum of its parts

Attendance Good

Attendance must be judged good
in comparison with last year’s pro-
gram. Still many students and fae-
ulty did net participate. This is un-
fortunate, for Contact demonstrated
that a small, liberal arts college iso-
lated from the centers of decision
and action can maintain an aware-
ness of and a relevance in our so-
ciety. This involvement in the world,
which is necessary if our thought
is to have meaning, is too often over-
looked in the academic program

Contact
many of the most severe problems
facing the United States today. Most
important Contact presented a chal-

presented and examined

lenge in ideas. I think that Wash-
ington and Lee sullers from a ple-
thora of tradition and an affluent
and normally self-satisfied student
body, but in addition, we have a con-
ventional, homegenous faculty. The
ferment and exchange which pro-
duce a fruitful dialogue are temper-

ed and starved by a lack of variety

Law School Support
Support for Contact in dispropor-

tionate numbers came from the Law

 

School, par freshmen

ticuiariy
when comp ired to the undergraduate

choo! Th tatement could prah

i
Jack Rebbins | ably be apple d to th prolessors of

 

the two schools as well. One often
hears the complaint that the world
is run by lawyers. Those who com-
plain also must be willing to act.

I understand that few professors
encouraged their students to attend
Contact. Some may have thought
that their students would be in-
formed of the program without an
announcement from the professors.
Others may have been unwilling to
damage their reputations by sup-
porting a program whose success
was not guaranteed. I hope that Con-
tact will receive stronger support
in the future.

Finally a note about the sponsors
of Contact, the fraternities. The IFC
pays for Contact beyond what por-
tion of the expense paid through par-
ents’ contributions (parents contrib-
uted over $1000; fraternity members

will bay 2.00-$3.00 each: total
$2800-$3000). Contract is a worth-
while project, and the fraternities

should be commended for their sup-
port

But the fraternities actually have
as much right to claim eredit for
Contact as a tax payer does to
claim credit for a National Park.
The IFC banned combo parties for
the Contact weekend but certain fra-
SAE and PEP,
scheduled iniatiation ceremonies for
weekend. At least one
prevented its freshmen

Ball Leads W&L Swimmers Over Loyola

Wildrick, Costello Also Sparkle
In Generals’ Best Engagement

Freshman Billy Ball came up with two firsts, including a

record-shattering performance

to lead the water-bound Generals to a 57-38 victory over Loy-

ola of Baltimore.
Ball went 2

of

copped first in the individual med-
ley.
Pat Costello turned his best per-

formance yet. He won the breast
stroke at 2:19.1, and was a key man
in the effort by the medley team

which fell .3 short of a pool record.
Others swimming the medley were
Nelson Head, Bill Wildrick, and Joe
Huston.

Wildrick, giving his usual strong
performance, also picked up a first
in the butterfly, touching out Bill
Clay.

Other firsts were snagged by Noel
Clinnard in diving and Ned Law-
rence in the 500 yard free style
Freshman Parker Moore picked up
two seconds in the 50 and 100 yard
free

Coach Norris Eastman
“I was looking for them to be in
condition, and they were.” East-
man said that the best times of the
year were turned in by most of the
Generals.

Loyola; 36-3

By RAY ZELTNER

Wednesday night in the Doremus

of 36 to 3

Loyola unfortunately neglected to
bring wrestlers in the 123 lb. and

their wins by forfeit, taking W&L
to an early 10-0 lead

in the middle of the second period,
bringing the score to 25-0

Co-captain Jamie Andrews, 160

The soap spera question of the day

“Can the erratic, radical, politi-
cal columnist find peace and success
as sports editor? Stay tuned.

Some changes are going ‘to be
made. For instance, W&L sports
is going to appear on this page. In
defiance of over sixty years of
Ring-tum Phi tradition, some at-
tention will be paid to accuracy.

Last, the new editor has no inten-
tion of coaching the teams of these
confines. Again, this is going against
heavy tradition. However, the editor
is a well known iconoclast any way.
Hopefully, his personal prejudices
for the football team, the Big Ten,
the Delts, and Samantha Eggar will |

not come through too often.

Spring practice is confined, gen-

coach Mac plans to do some offensive
experimentation. He will be spending

before the last two games and the
CAC tournament.

Hampden-Sydney

Hampden-Sydney comes to Lex-
ington tonight sporting a second
place in the tough Mason-Dixon
Conference. A win against the Ti-
gers will put the Generals in a posi-
tion to make a strong showing in
the CAC tournament Feb. 24-26. But
Coach Canfield is not taking the last
regular season opponent—Emory
and Henry—lightly. Although they
haven’t won a lot of ball games, they
will bring a scrappy ball club to
Lexington Friday night. The Gen-
erals have their work cut out for
them and two victories would give
them a 10-12 record—the best since
the ’58 season and W&L’s all-Am-
erican Dom Flora.

Notes:

With his 16 points against East-
ern Mennonite Rob Bauer became
the first freshman in 11 years to
score over 300 points in a season,
The last to do it was Dom Flora in
1955. Bauer’s 306 points give him an
average of 16.1 points per game
which leads the team. Frank Morri-
son is the only other General in
double figures with a 13.5 average.
The other three starters, Jody Kline,
John Carrere, and Bob Spessard are
bunehed together between 9 and 10
points a game.

Generals Average 74

W&L at present is averaging 74
points a game while giving up 79
points a game on defense. Since the
first two games when their oppon-
ents scored over 100 points, the
Generals have not allowed any team
to reach that level. Certainly, one
can see the giant strides Coach Can-
field has made in W&lL’s basketball

three escapes but trailed his oppon-
ent by a take-down and riding time,
giving Loyola its only points by de-
cision.

Jay Clark, 177 lb., narrowly missed
his pin in the third period, but led
his opponent in points by a near-
fall and two minutes of riding time,
giving W&L another decision.

Wrestling his first match of the
season, heavywegiht Warren Stewart
completely conquered his opponent.
He gained a take-down and a near-
fall in the first period and a reverse,
near-fall, and predicament in the
second. He delivered the coup de
grace by pinning his man two min-
utes into the third period, bringing
the final total to 36-3.

After going down to defeat last
week at the hands of Duke and
North Carolina State, Coach Miller’s
words were indeed appropriate: “It’s

much of it.” He pointed out that in
cities today we develop no distine-
tive architectural styles of our own
because tradition is sacrificed for ef-
ficiency. He went on to say that Ex-
cessive social functionalism is a
problem with most cities today. That
is, that business areas are separate
from residential areas, art areas
from business areas so that “each
part of the town is only half a life.”

He went on to discuss the problem
of slums and stated that since, as
long as income is unequally distrib-
uted, there will always be one group
which is poorer (and naturally will
have poorer housing), and since
there is a growing trend toward ur-
banization, the prospect is for more
slums in the next 100 years.

His final subject was the push
to the suburbs. A crucial result of
this, he said, is the increased prob-
lem of transportation, which results
in the influx of tremendous num-
bers of automobiles into the city.
This problem, he felt, could be rem-
edied either by prohibiting cars from
large cities, or by placing a prohibi-
tive tax (such as $1500) on all cars
used in the city.

He concluded that the problem in
a developing city is that each per-
son strives for his desires and suf-
fers from everyone else’s striving.
He said that a situation arises where
“everyone can do what he wishes
and none can get what he wants.”

Dr. Jay T. Wright

On Saturday afternoon Dr. Jay T.
Wright presented a paper on the
plight and condition of education in
an increasingly urbanized American
society. Dr. Wright, a psychologist,
educator, and minister from Pitts-
burgh, paid particular attention to
the situation at small rurally locat-
ed colleges such as Washington and
Lee.

In modern America, Dr. Wright
said that colleges outside of urban
centers would have to maintain the
ideal of a liberal education while
urban schools became predominately
technical. The recent bill passed by
the Virginia legislature to establish
15 technical junior colleges was cited
as proof of the tendency toward
technical education.

Dr. Wright said that urbanization

would increase and that the small
college by nurturing tolerance could
make a positive contribution to Am-
erican society.

To aid this process Dr. Wright ad-
vocated acceptance of Negro appli-
cants and foreign students.

Dr. Wright also stated that a cam-
pus should have at least one com-
munist on the faculty to forment in-
tellectual debate and controversy.

After his address Dr. Wright was
questioned by Prof. Van Den Haag,
Mr. James Boatwright, and Dr.
Charles W. Barritt.

Highlighting the CONTACT week-
end, noted writer Claude Brown,
author of Manchild in the Promised
Land, discussed the inherent prom-
lems of the Negro ghettos in the
urban area,

Initially, Brown focused his atten-
tion on the “Harlems” of such urban
centers as Detroit, Chicago, New
York and Los Angeles. He observed
that the Negro communities in the
large cities are populated with peo-
ple who lack education and who
cannot articulate their grievances.
“Anyone with money, anyone who is
respectable, anyone who is doing
good, in short the Establishment, is
their enemy,” commented Brown.

Exploring the racial situation in
New York City, the speaker stated
that the people of Harlem are gener-
ally disallusioned with politics. He
expressed hope for the success of the
proposed reforms advocated by re-
cently-elected Mayor John Lind-
say, but conceded that Lindsay will
have to “buck” the established pow-
er structure if he is to effect a
change.

Commenting that not even the
“black bourgeoisie” comprehended
the plight of the Negro in the ghet-
to, Brown summarized the primary
problems. “You can’t get anybody
who really understands the ghetto
to do something about them, for they
have no power.”

Brown concluded his talk with a
discussion of contemporary racial
problems on a national level. View-
ing the racial question as an “evolv-
ing problem,” the speaker stated that
the Negro is “no longer willing to
accept his situation passively.”

He disclaimed the effect of Mar-
tin Luther King’s non-violent ap-
proach to Civil Rights.

FASHIONS

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

   

CALLING ON THE BOARD! In order to set our 1966 campus

fashion reports in the proper perspective, we called upon members
of Esquire’s 1965 College Advisory Board to bring us up to date
on what’s being worn on campuses North, East, South and West
this winter. What regional fashion shifts occur as you move about
the country? How does the casual attire worn in the West, for
example, differ from that worn in the East? And which fashion
trends seem most likely to spread out to other areas of the country?
For some authoritative answers, read on...

THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, according to
Michael Mains, University of Arizona ’65,
there’s a brisk traffic in lightweight conserva-
tive suits with the dash of color supplied largely
in neckwear. Striped ties predominate, but
foulards are moving in again, Everybody wears
button-downs, and the three-piece suit is in-
frequently seen on campus. In the mornings,
when there’s apt to be a chill in the air, a
sweater worn with a button-down sport shirt
and wheat jeans is sufficiently warm and in-
formal enough for class. Heather-toned sweaters
hold the edge, and corduroy jeans or wash-and-
wear khakis complete the casual scene, In foet-
wear, a wing tip properly complements a suit,
while saddle shoes or loafers are a standard part
of the informal picture,

SWINGING NORTH, Richard Gentry, Jr., University of Michigan,

tells us that for north-country winters the rugged toggle coats are
serviceable and popular. Above the knee lengths are what every-
one’s wearing. Here, the accent falls heavily on the informal touch:
V-neck sweaters in solid colors; button-downs, both plain and
striped; tapered corduroys and wheat jeans; and a solid serving
of loafers and chukka boots, For fraternity parties and other social
events, plaid sport jackets are beginning to make the scene. Her-
ringbone and heather sport jackets lead the field, but big patterns
are beginning to make some headway. In neckwear, there’s a trio
of popular entries: stripes, club figures and paisleys. Semiformal
slacks are usually tapered flannel, and loafers or wing-tip shoes go
best with the sport jacket and slacks.

WAY OUT WEST, at Berkeley, Scott Gregg in-

forms us that one of the unique features on
his campus is the colored sneaker. Perhaps this
is a manifestation of Berkeley's celebrated pen-
chant for innovation. Beyond that, the fashion
picture, both in casual and dressy attire, follows
patterns familiar throughout the rest of the
country’s campuses, V-neck sweaters predomi-
nate, with crew necks a close second. Sport
shirts appear ina wide, but not necessarily wild,
variety of patterns and colors. Madras is the
outer limit. Permanent press casual slacks and
blue jeans are In in the casual order of things.
Herringbone, hound’s-tooth, and heather mix-
tures complete the sport jacket picture, with

     

\ ? greens and grays the most popular colors in the
tapered slacks which are worn with the jacket.
Colored or pin stripe button-downs and diagonal-striped ties (plus

 

\

loafers) round out the accessories picture.

ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD, the big thing,

according to John Lamb, Jr. of Princeton, is
boots. Everybody seems to be wearing them
with informal clothing especially during the
