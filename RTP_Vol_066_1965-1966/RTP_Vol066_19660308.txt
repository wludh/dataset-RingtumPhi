Faculty Eliminates Funds For ‘The

 

Faculty Upholds

‘No Girls” Rule

In Dormitories

——

STUDENT PLEA FAILS

President Cole To Initiate
Study Of Lounge Facilities
Available For Students

The faculty has rejected a

student plea that upperclass- |

men and law students be per-
mitted to have female guests
in their dormitory rooms dur-

ing specified hours.

The action taken at yesterday’s
faculty meeting was announced
Tuesday by Dean of Students Ed-
ward C. Atwood, Jr.

The student request reached the
faculty in the form of a resolution
approved by the executive commit-
tee.

Earlier, the University Student
Affairs Committee had split 6-6 on
a vote whether to recommend the
resolution to the faculty.

Lack of Facilities

Dean Atwood, who presented the
resolution before the faculty, said
the request was prompted primar-
ily by a lack of lounge facilities in
the university’s two upperclass dor-
mitories. He said that a majority
of students in these dormitories feel
that they are handicapped socially
by the situation.

Except for 330 freshmen who are
required to live in freshman dormi-
tories, and 80 upperclassmen and
law students living in the two up-
perclass dormitories, Washington and
Lee’s other 940 students reside either
in private accommodations or in the
universities eighteen fraternity hous-
es. Most of the students living in
the upperclass dormitories are not
affiliated with fraternities and do
not have a general access to lounge
and parlor facilities in the fraterni-
ty houses, Dean Atwood said.

Dean Atwood said he felt the
faculty turned down the student pe-
tition largely because it would in-
troduce more problems that it would
solve.

After faculty action, President
Cole said he would begin a study
to see what could be done to make
adequate lounge facilities available
to students living in the upperclass
dormitories.

Three Fourths of Student Body Votes

 

NSA Overwhelmed By Three to One

Washington and Lee membership! Third, I believe that a substantial

in the United States National Stu-
dent Association (NSA) was decis-
ively defeated in a student body
poll held Friday by a margin of
three to one. An affirmative vote fav-
ored a one-year trial membership,
as recommended by the ODK Coun-
cil. Affirmative votes totaled 204 to
707 “No” votes.

Law students voted almost unan-
imously against the trial member-
ship: out of 137 votes cast in Tucker
Hall, only 18 voted “Yes.”

Ballot boxes were located at Wash-
ington Hall, the Law School, and
the Commons, lasting from 8 a.m. to
5 p.m. EC members supervised the
voting.

Student Body President Fred Min-
del issued the following statement:

“Although I am able to understand
and respect this vote, 1 cannot help
but be disappointed by it. The rea-
son I proposed this membership in
the first place was because I felt it
would be an asset to our student
government and student life in gen-
eral: my view has not changed
There are three principle reasons for
my disappointment

“First the E.C. will be deprived
of valuable sources of information
as well as some possible inspiration,
Second, NSA concerns itself with a
dimension of student life which is

 

almost completely neglected at WéeL

 

 

number of voters were deluded by
some of the intentional distortions
handed out by the opposition.
“Even the opposition, however,
conceded that NSA had some very
attractive aspects. It is altogether
possible (if perhaps more difficult)
for W&L to make certain necessary
strides in these areas without help
of NSA, and right now this is my
foremost desire for our school. This
advancement, however, can only
come about through an “enlightened”

E.C. which is actively supported by
the student body.

“It would be extremely encourag-
ing to see the opposition to NSA,
in light of their recent concern with
the general welfare of W&L con-
tinue their efforts in the direction
of positive and progressive improve-
ments which everyone admits can
and should be made. If this can be
done we will all be satisfied, and
then it will cease to matter to some
of us whether or not we joined
NSA.”

House Finance

By JOHN CARRERE, JR.
After a long discusion on
the merits of having each fra-
ternity employ a Certified Pub-
loc Accountant, the IFC passed
a proposal by a 14-4 vote to
accept the CPA plan previous-

ly submitted by two local firms.
However, in order to validate the
amendment, it must again pass a
two-third’s majority at the next IFC
meeting.

The six-point program calls for
a study to be made of each fraterni-
ty by a CPA agency and a system of
auditing planned for each house. It
would include an annual audit and
also consultations, monthly or as
frequently as the CPA decided. Un-
the program a voucher system would
be instigated in which two persons
instead of one would be responsible
for a fraternity’s books. The cost of
the CPA service would run between
$200-$400 annually.

Dean Atwood and President Chuck
Griffin strongly supported the mea-
sure because they claim that there
was a great need for more accurate
bookkeeping. Dean Atwod stated
that it was not uncommon for one-
half of all the houses to have to
start over and rebalance a whole
year's figures.

The pink sheets now turned in
monthly to the dean's office can be
easily falsified and frequently are
in order to momentaritly balance the
house’s liabilities and assests. The
dean said that all this could be pre-
vented if there was someone check-
ing the books monthly, or at least
periodically. It was pointed out that
these periodic audits would not cost
much more than the one annual
audit obtained now by most fraterni-

Century-Old Magazine Arouses
Unanimous Opposition of Faculty

Washington and Lee University’s faculty has approved a
resolution that is expected to end publication of the nearly
century-old Southern Collegian as an official university stu-

The faculty voted unanimously Monday in favor of a reso-

lution “‘opposing continuation of the payment of funds from
- = ——————==<<<«—-— the comprehensive tuition fee to sup-

port the Southern Collegian.

Began In 1868

The magazine is published four
times during each school year. It
began publication in 1868 during the
administration of Robert E. Lee as
a student literary and general in-
terest magazine. In recent years its
emphasis has been directed toward
campus humor.

The faculty resolution is an out-
growth of the university’s current
two-year intensive self-study pro-
ject. The self-study committee, in
its evaluation of student publications,
recommended that the faculty with-
draw endorsement of the Southern
Collegian as a first step toward re-
moval of all University support for
the magazine.

Self-Study Citation

The self-study committee recom-
mendation cited the magazine’s poor
taste in content, the embarrassment
suffered by the university as a re-
sult, and the committee’s opinion
that the magazine serves no useful
educational purpose.

The Southern Collegian is edited
by a student staff under the direc-
tion of a student editor elected by
a faculty-student Publications Board.
Approximately half of its produc-
tions costs of $3,000 in 1964-65 was
derived from university fees paid
by all students.

Neither the University nor the
Publications Board exercises any
form of censorship over the maga-
zine, although distribution of sev-
eral issues in the past has been
halted by the University because of
objections to its content.

The faculty action Monday is ex-
pected to set in motion administra-
tive procedures that will reject any
future Publications Board budget re-
quests for funds for Southern Col-
legian use.

For The Wrong Reason

The controversy over Washington and Lee membership
in NSA, and the results of last Friday’s student body poll,
proves that while Senator McCarthy may be gone, he has not
been forgotten. Rarely have so many irrelevant and blandly
prejudicial side-issues been dragged into consideration of a
problem.

Those active patriots who opposed NSA managed to give
Liberalism versus Conservatism, “leftist’”’ infiltration, and “‘anti-
democratic” tendencies in NSA more attention than whether
or not the organization could benefit Washington and Lee.
It was an exercise in deliberate distortion and induced mass
hysteria, the like of which has no parallel save in the free-
wheeling tactics of the late unlamented Senator from Wiscon-
sin.

The opponents of NSA consciously misrepresented the
costs involved. Before the ODK Forum debate on the question,
the NSA representative discussed the financial obligations of
member schools in detail with one of the opposing students.
Yet still we were subjected to outlandish claims that NSA
membership would cost W&L “over $600” annually. The ac-
tual basic fee would have been $15.

NSA’s opponents succeeded in presenting a false picture
of the organization which made it appear little better than
a junior adjunct of the international Communist conspiracy.
The “red herring” which was so generously and attractively
served up by NSA’s opponents ranks as one of their meanest
maneuvers. They linked up NSA with everything except the
Abraham Lincoln Brigade.

They neatly managed to ignore the endorsements NSA
received from President Johnson, Kennedy, and Eisenhower,
and most governmental agencies and departments. They man-
aged to forget that NSA has led the fight for years against
Communist-dominated student organizations in the United
States and Europe. They even managed to forget the whole
purpose of the discussion on NSA. Like so many others of
their ilk, winning the debate was infinitely more important
than discovering truth. God, for them, fights on the side of
frothy glibness.

As President Fred Mindel frequently pointed out, a re-
sponsible case can be made against NSA. It has its negative
points which should have calmly and reasonably been discussed.
An intelligent and rational dialogue would have been the result
and the student body would have been the better for it, whether
NSA passed or not. But the negative half of the dialogue de-
generated into a destructive harangue, the goal of which was
neither concensus nor edification, Rather, its purpose was to
stampede the student body into voting against NSA, and they
were successful beyond their wildest expectations.

We view with disappointment the defeat of NSA, for it
would have been a worthwhile experiment. However, we look
with genuine sadness on the tactics and attitudes of those who
so energetically worked for NSA’s defeat. They have won their
little skirmish, but the University has paid too high a price
for their victory, We succumbed to a blatant appeal to mortal
fear. It is this defeat, and not so much that of NSA, which is
distressing.

Perhaps NSA is not for Washington and Lee. Perhaps it
is not a worthwhile organization and perhaps it is just as well we
did not join. Maybe it was too politically oriented. But does
the end once again justify the means; are we witnesses to
another noble deed accomplished “at all costs?” Perhaps the
seven hundred seven who voted No were right; but if
they are, they have done the right thing for the wrong reason.

Bogart Ultimately Responded
But Belmondo Remains Blase

 

By WARD BRIGGS

Last time I was talking about the
French love of the vulgarity of
American gangster and _ soldier-of-
fortune movies, and the misplaced
admiration for Humphrey Bogart,
amongst many of theCAMPus movie-
amongst many of the CAMPus
moviegoers.

Belmondo’s gangsters in Breath-
less is, unlike Bogart, blase. He’s
even blase about experiences he
hasn't had. If everything hasn’t hap-
pened to the character that Bel-
mondo portrays it doesn’t much mat-
ter. He steals a car, kills a cop,
makes it with Jean Seberg, and
steals another car—but he’s not sub-
stantially different after having done
so. The whole point about Bogart is
that these experiences had changed
him, usually before the opening of
the film.

The whole point about Belmondo
is that no experience will change
the character of Breathless. Under-
lying this view of the character is
the basic epistomological assumption
about man in the modern world:
experience as a means to knowledge
about ourselves or others is really
rather meaningless. Either that or
the nerve ends of our sensibilities
have become capped—so much that
we cannot be touched by what we
feel.

With Bogart, on the other hand,

 

there existed the possibility of
knowledge, some sort of dramatic
response to it, and, by inference,
a redemption of sorts. Bogart would
help the fleeing freedom fighter. He
didn’t believe in anything or any-
one, to be sure, but he didn’t believe
in Paul Henreid the underground
worker more than he didn’t believe
in his Fascist enemies.

The point is , that Bogart ultimate-
ly responded. He had gone to Casa-
blanca or the Florida Keys or some
Jamacian port to absent himself from
the major battlefields of human con-
flict, but even in these places that
were out of the way, that were very
definitely not where it was at, he
couldn't help responding, being
drawn back into the mainstream of
human life and conflict. He always
found he recognized and appreciated
human feelings which he himself no
longer had. That was the whole dra-
matic movement of his character—
being brought to the realization that
some spark of human feeling, of re-
sponse and responsibility to his fel-
low man could yet be struck within
him. And when it was, he would be
forced back to “where it's at.”

The Boredom of the Moment
But with Belmondo this nostalga
for dead or trampled human felings

is itself lost.
He recognizes nothing but the

 

moment. Betwen grief and nothing,
Belmondo says in Breathless, he’ll
take nothing. Nothing but the mo-
ment and this with utter boredom.
He doesn’t have to be drawn back
to human feling or to anything that’s
“where it’s at.” He’s the center of
his universe. Nothing matters be-
yond him—no clash of alien ideol-
ogies, no human sufferings beyond
or within his ken; only the moment.
And because nothing beyond him
matters much, he doesn’t matter
much either—to himself or his au-
dience.

This to me is where Belmondo is
at in Breathless, and it’s what he
projects well as an actor; a man
who embodies a paradox. A man of
vitality and inervation. One who is
going everywhere and nowhere, and
doesn’t much care. (He’s chased in
Breathless and pursues and is pur-
sued everywhere in That Man from
Rio.) He is possessed of great energy
on the outside and ennui at the core,
of beautiful, would and even zany
movement—but with an empty eye
at the center of the hurricane, Un-
like Bogart, the flame of human
warmth has not been extinguished—
it has simply never ben lit and never
can be.

Interestingly, I think the audience
views Belmondo with paradoxical

Ideas on Preservation of Traditions:
Standards, Values and Enforcement

By DR. JOHN M. GUNN
Assistant Profssor of Economics

It has been argued recently in this
paper that the critical issue in the
matter of Conven-
tional Dress is not
whether the tradi-
toin will be pre-
served but what
the future role of
the Assimilation
Committee should
be.

I believe this
argument mistakes
the facts of the
matter.

The critical issue
at the moment is, precisely, whether
Conventional Dress will continue to
be a standard at Washington and
Lee, not only in the future, but in
the closing weeks of the present se-
mester.

The role of the Assimilation Com-
mittee (or more generally, the role
of organized procedures to main-
tain traditional standards) also is
important. Before turning to that
matter, however, consider first two
other questions, and a comment on
the speaking tradition.

Whose Standards?

Gentlemanly Behavior, the Friend-
ly Greeting, and Conventional Dress
often are called “student traditions.”
This term understates their role.
They are University traditions.
Students, Faculty, Administrative
Officers, and Alumni—all have valid
interest in these traditions and in
their potential contribution to the
University’s total effort.

In the past, students usually have
assumed primary responsibility for
such limited measures as were need-
ed for conserving these traditions.
In a college where so much authority
has been delegated to a student
government, and where student self-
government is regarded as a valuable
part of the overall educational ex-
perience, it is especially fitting that
this role should have been so.

It surely would not be improper,
in the present circumstances, for
members of the Faculty and Admin-
istration to take part in efforts to
preserve that which is threatened.
On the other hand, a too-vigorous
effort from the Faculty would be
likely to have an opposite effect
from the desired one,

Whose Protest?

If a man genuinely believed that
the standards which I believe aug-
ment the central mission of the
University, in fact, detracted from
that mission, I would support his
rejection of those standards. If a
man felt his personal freedom in-
fringed seriously by the communi-
ty’s desire that he wear a necktie,
neat against a buttoned collar, I
might think his freedom rather
fragile, but I would respect his po-
sition

On the other hand, a protest for
protest's sake is as useless as tradi-
tion for tradition’s sake, and more

 

 

 

likely to be injurious—not only in-

jurious to the community but in-
jurious to the protestor, himself,
who is distracted from HIS own
true objectives. How much of the
current cries for “freedom” or for
“proper goals” mask sophomoric pro-
test for protest’s sake? And how
much of them reflect sheer lethargy?

On Exchange of Greetings

Perhaps it would facilitate the
friendly greeting if the practice were
recognized that when two persons,
not close friends, approach each
other, the junior person speaks first.
Freshmen speak to upperclassmen;
students speak to members of the
faculty, etc. This is but a convenient
rule-of-thumb. It would have been
assumed by all, in an earlier age.

Regardless of who speaks first, not
to return a greeting is more than
neglect of tradition. It is a flagrant
act of rudneness. (Perhaps we need a
tradition that if a men declines point-
edly to return one’s greeting, the
greeter has leave to trip him, with-
out liability.) It takes less effort to
return a greeting than to turn one’s
head in a deliberate effort to avoid
returning it.

Organization and Tradition

Because of the quadrennial turn-
over of student membership in a col-
lege community, collegiate traditions
are less able to be self-sustaining
than traditions of a more stable com-
munity. Therefore, they may re-
quire some organized effort if they
are to be conserved. That is to say,
something like an Assimilation
Committee has a role to play. Never-
theless, collegiate traditions are
in a healthy state when organized
procedures to maintain them are
minimal.

It will be helpful in considering
the appropriate role of the Assimila-
tion Committee as conservator of
beneficial traditions to ask two sep-
arate questions: What should its role
be in “ordinary circumstances”?
What should its role be in the cur-
rent crisis in dress?

In “ordinary circumstances” I
would view the primary function
of the Assimilation Committee as an
educational one. It should seek to
achieve conformity with tradition—
not to impose it. It should assist
new students in appreciating the
individual and mutual benefits to be
derived rfom maintaining the com-
munity's established standards. Pri-
mary “enforcement” of these stand-
ards should come—CAN § and
ONLY—from the attitudes of the
mass of the Student Body, not from
the procedures of student govern-
ment

The Assimilation Committee could
make effective use of power to call
before it individuals who neglect
community standards, to discuss
with them the relationships between
individual freedem and community
responsibility. In some cases, men
will persist in ignoring the stand-
ards of the community, and the
community must determine how far
it le willing to coerce the individual
to enhance the common welfare.

 

My choice would be that if an oc-
casional man neglects the conven-
tions of community behavior, let
him. On the other hand, when the
occasional man finds a friend, and
they find a few more, the erosion
of community customs can accelerate
rapidly, especially if a few are seek-
ing deliberately to destroy those
customs. The community then faces
an unpleasant dilemma: coerce the
individuals or watch the communi-
ty’s significant traditions evaporate.

If the community faces a dilemma,
however, the dissenting individual
also faces a dilemma, unless he be
devoid of any sense of community
responsibility. He must decide
whether his freedom of style in dress
and his freedom not to speak a
greeting to his fellow scholars is
worth so much to him that he is
willing to aid in the destruction of
something his fellow members of the
University regard as beneficial to
their development and esthetically
pleasing. His dilemma is the more
awkward for the realization that he
joined the Washington and Lee com-
munity quite freely, knowing what
its established standards of behavior
and dress are and have been.

The Present Crisis

Even more than in “ordinary” cir-
cumstances ,the survival of Conven-
tional Dress at Washington and Lee
at present depends upon its enforce-
ment by the expressed attitudes of
the mass of the Student Body, who

Assimilation Viewed as Arbitrary

Since Some Seen

By NICK RUFFIN

Last Thursday a small number of
students undertook a mass assimila-
tion of the student body at Wash-
ington and Lee, All students not
wearing conventional dress as de-
fined by the Assimilation Commit-
tee were assimilated.

The theory of the Assimilation
Committee is that it is to penalize
the students not wearing convention-
dress. The responsibility for polic-
ing the students theoretically rests
with the students themselves. Sup-
posedly, a student will assimilate
another student regardless of the
violator's fraternity or campus im-
age. In performing a mass assimila-
tion, the small number of students
assumed the task in which the rest
of the students have been deliquent.

The purpose of the mass assimila-
tion was to demonstrate the absurd-
ity of the idea of an Assimilation
Committee and enforced convention-
al dress. Over 100 students were as-
similated in one morning demon-
strating the weakness of the present
assimilation system.

Many students who observed the
mass assimilation were infuriated.
They thought that the Assimilation
Committee no longer functioned or
that they had some privilege status
which was being challenged. The

Untouchable’

case of Mickey Isikoff proves that
the Assimilation procedure _ still
functions in a very arbitrary man-
ner, Mr. Isikoff was the victim of a
“joke” in which a small number of
students employed the assimilation
apparatus to persecute a fellow stu-
dent. These students may not have
forseen the severity of the ultimate
penalty; but they did not come forth
to testify in Mr, Isikoff’s behalf, so
I assume they were not terribly
disturbed by his Social Probation.
The Untouchables

At the present time there are
thirty or forty students who are less
“eonventional” in their dress than
was Mr. Isikoff. But these students
are apparently “untouchable.” For
some reason the assimilation pro-
eedure does not touch them. All
students at W&L are equal under the
rules, but some are more equal than
others.

As long as students think the As-
similation Committee does not affect
them, they are unlikely to vote to
abolish the enforcement of con-
ventional dress. But the mass assimi-
lation reached the untouchables. The
asimilations will continue until all

realize they are subject to Social
Probation
Most students were not outraged

Bart Taylor

By CHARLES FRERET

One word can express Coach Nor-
ris Eastman’s feelings about this
year’s swimming team—“succesful.”
Indeed the Generals’ tankmen were
a success as they swam their way
to an 8-3 record and a second place
in the CAC tournament. Led by next
year’s co-captains, Bill Wildrick and
Bart Taylor, the Generals broke
every record except two.

Bill Wildrick led the record break- |

Coach Eastman’s Job Security for the Ne

ers as he set two W&L pool records:
the 200 yd. freestyle and the 200 yd.
butterfly; was a part of two others—-
the medley relay and the 400 yd.
freestyle relay; and was involved
in five W&lL records for regulation
pools—100 yd. butterfly, 200 yd. but-
terfly, 200 yd. freestyle, and both
medley and freestyle relays.

Bart Taylor set the W&L pool rec-
ord for the 100 yd. freestyle and was
anchor man of both the medley and
freestyle relays which set pool rec-
ords. Bart is also co-holder of the
W&L record for regulation pools in
the 100 yd. freestyle and was anchor
man of the record breaking medley
relay team

Freshman Billy Ball closed out a
tremendous season with four firsts
in the CAC tournament, 3 of which
were records. Billy holds two W&L
pool records—the 200 yd. indicidual
and the 200 yd. backstroke; four
regulation pool records—the 100 and
200 yd. backstroke, the 200 and 400
individual medleys; and swam back-
stroke in the record breaking med-
ley relay.

is the hardest working team he has
had and with their keen competition
and a year's experience, they should
do well next year.

Coach Eastman notes, however,
that the opponents, of which Duke

Anthony Announces Trivia
Deadline, Staff Members

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Mannered Reporter

Michael Anthony, Secretary to the
producers, has announced that with
only two days remaining before the
deadline, 13 fraternities have yet to
enter teams in the Ring-tum Phi-
Radio W&L Trivia Contest. No en-
tries will be accepted after March
10.

“Aside from this disappointing
number of entries,’ Anthony said,
“we are making excellent progress
with our plans for the program. A
great many outstandingly esoteric
questions have been provided for
us by well-wishers. I think we can
promise a really fine lineup.”

Personnel for the broadcast, which
will be held March 17, have mostly
been selected. M.C. for the program
will be Radio Personality Tom
White, while Dr. Keith Shillington
(by special permission of the Troub-
adour Theater) will serve as score-
keeper. Mr. J. K. Jennings of the
journalism school is technical as-
sistant to the producers.

“One of our chief problems,” says
Anthony, “is guaranteeing the in-
tegrity of the questions to be used
in the final competition. We are
presently negotiating with the local
banks for the loan of an armored
car to transport the material to the
studio.”

Entries should be mailed to Radio
Personality White at Box 457.

Notice

A musician who conducts on a
tape recorder, Vladimir Ussachevsky,
will appear tonight at 8 p.m. in
Room 201 of the New Science
Building. He will lecture and give a
concert entitled “An Introduction
to Electronic Music” tomorrow night
in Lee Chapel.

Ussachevsky is a 54-year-old com-
poser and Columbia University pro-
fesor who began his electronic mus-
ic experiments with a tape recorder
in 1951. The phrase “push-button
music” annoys Ussachevsky as much
as the term “space music.” “If the
composer is skillful, it will show
through. His music will be better
than someone who just doodles with
sound.”

Ussachevsky’s appearance here is
sponsored by the Concert Guild.

 

 

Future Bright
For Riflemen

Sergeant Kenneth Taylor is op-
timistically looking forward to next
year’s rifle season. There are many
reasons for the coach’s high hopes.

Only one senior, Harold Head,
will be lost through graduation in
June. “With losing only one boy I
feel confident that we will have a
strong ten man-plus varsity next
year,” commented Coach Taylor.

The improvement shown by fresh-
men during the season indicates
the hopes for next year.

Sgt. Taylor said, “the freshmen
contributed greatly to the program
this year and their improvement
was marked. Their scores jumped
from below 1300 early in the year to
a high of 1371 at the end of the sea-
son.”

The shooters made a fine late sea-
son showing in the State Champion-
ship meet at Fort Lee. The team
finished in a fifth place tie with
Hampden-Sydney and W&M. Ahead
of the Generals were VMI, VPI
(both military schools), Richmond,
and UVa.

 

The Generals made their best
showing in the last meet of the
season. It was the National Rifle
Association Sectional meet, at Fort
Lee, on February 26.

W&L finished a deceptive seventh.
The only teams to score higher were
three teams from VMI, two from
VPI, and UVa. The Generals finished
ahead of Richmond and W&M, both
of whom had defeated W&L earlier
in the year.

In the Sectional, Robert Lackey
shot a 280 (out of a possible 300).
This was the highest single per-
formance of the year the varsity.

“IT think it is important to note,”
continued Sgt. Taylor, “that we
finished just 42 points behind the
winning team from VMI.”

The Sectional team was composed
of Head, sophomore Lackey, and
freshmen Ron Kessler and Crawford
Williams.

Shillington Moves to Sports

The versatile Dr. J. K. (the Gard-
ener) Shillington, fresh from recent
triumphs at the Troubadour Theatre
and in orange tree growing, will
reign again in Doremus Gymnasium
Thursday night.

Campus sports strategists were in
unison in support of the naming of
Dr. Shillington as chief master mind
(coach) in the faculty’s attempt to
subvert the students on the basket-
ball court.

Past faculty wins can be credited
almost entirely to the chemistry pro-
fessor’s quick mind and heady eval-
uation of the strategic situation.
When victory is at stake he knows
what action to take and cooly takes
it. This usually means intimidating
the referee.

The student team remains shroud-
ed in secrecy. There seems to be
some difficulty in rounding up vol-
unteers to face Shillington’s vengeful
band. Coach Tim Henry said that
four fraternities have yet to find
willing representatives.

Team members named thus far are
Tom Bruton of the Betas, Chuck
Boggs of DU, Randy Poore of Kappa
Sig, Buck Woodford for the Lamb
Choppers, Gil Turner of the Fijis,
Gerry Taylor of the IU, Charlie
Freret of the Phi Psis, Joe Framp-
tom of the PiKAs, and Phi Kap
Wick Vellines.

The Pi Phis will be represented by
Dave Schwendeman, Dick Bradford
will play for SAE, Jim Woody for
the Chis, Buck Clement for the
SNus, and Ron Laupheimer for ZBT.

 

“Doc” Shillington

Henry declined to make any pre-
diction as to the outcome of the
game. Dr. Shillington, on the other
hand, when asked how badly he ex-
pected to beat the student entry,
commented, “If we can get to the
referees, quite badly. We hope to
deal with the referees in an adult
manner.”

Proceeds will go to the athletic
fund to be used for such things
as scouting—especially scouting Se-
wanee.

Two new appointments were an-
nounced at the beginning of the
meeting. F. L. Wilson was appoint-
ed chairman of the House Man-
agers’ Committee. Tom Baremore
was announced as chairman of the
Parents’ Weekend Committee.

The chairmanship of Contact was
also announced to now include two
posts. The responsibility would be
divided between a business manager
and an operations manager. Taking
this into consideration, applicants
for chairman were instructed to re-
submit their applications next Mon-
day.

A number of suggested changes,
already passed by the Faculty Com-
mittee, also were accepted by the
IFC with an 18-0 vote. These must
also receive a two-third’s majority
at the next meeting. Significant is
the change of the stipulation of limit-
ing combos to four football week-
ends and three off weekends. The
alteration would allow a fraternity
to have their seven “combo” week-
ends whenever they wanted. An un-
limited number of “chip-in” parties
are also now allowed. A “chip-in”
party was defined as one in which
the people of the house are given
an option whether to contribute to
its cost or not.

to end all enforcement.

The participants in the mass assim-

vindictive overtones. We regret that

The reaction to the mass assimila-

of bodily harm and phrenetic expres-
tions of anti-semitism. The coats

wearing them, “gentlemen.”
