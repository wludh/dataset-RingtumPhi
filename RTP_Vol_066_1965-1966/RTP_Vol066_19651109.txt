day

BORDA

For the first time in the history of Washington and Lee,
students will hold voting positions on a faculty committee. The

new group, called the Studen

t Affairs Committee, was

ap-

proved by the faculty on November 1, at its monthly meeting.

As a result,
I’reshman,

tions—were eliminated and _ their
functions incorporated in the new
group. Futhermore, the Student Af-
fairs Committee will assume juris-
diction over all student affairs not
now covered by other committees

and serve in an advisory capacity to

the Dean of Student’s Office.

Four students and six faculty
members will be regular members
of the committee. Set to represent
students are the President of the
Student Body, President of the IFC,

of the Student Control
and the President of the
Student Bar Association. Dean At-

Affiliation Upon

By JOE WILSON

Gerhard Lenski, chairman of the
Department of Sociology at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina, last night
at duPont Hall presented a relation-
ship of religious affiliation to voting
behavior.

Professor Lenski, supporting his
theory with voting statistics, believes
that religion is one of the most im-
portant factors deermining voting
habits. Experts have ignored religion
as a voting vactor, he said, because
they thought of religious groups as
only associations which meet once a
week for an hour.

While this may contain some
truth, Lenski contends that relig-
ious groups are not merely asso-
ciations, but are really commun-
ties. As a community, these homo-
genous groups become partially
closed and develop a consensus
which is expressed at the ballot
box.

Sociological analysis of voting be-
gan when Columbia University
studied the Presidential campaign of
1940 in Erie County, Ohio. The ex-
| pected voting factors of class, family,

party loyalty, press influence, and
others were studied.

Also found, but not studied, was
a religious factor, which had most
Protestants voting Republican and
most Catholics voting Democrat.
It was seen that the religious fac-
tor was three times greater than
the class factor in determining the
vote,

From this initial study, a pattern
has emerged showing religion al-
ways comparable to class as a factor,
and, in 1960, religion was 34 per cent
to class 12:5 per cent. The Presiden-
tial campaign of 1960 was the height
of the religious factor in American
balloting, Lenski explained.

Dr. Lenski cited other stastics on
an international level which showed
that the deeper religious split in a
country, the higher the religious
factor in voting. England is an ex-
ample of a country in which reli-
gion does not enter politics because
nearly everyone is Protestant. Cana-
da is the opposite because the coun-
try is split deeply between Catho-

Classes Poll Set for Tomorrow

*

Debate Scheduled for Newcomb 8
At 7 p.m. Tonight on Class Vote

SNOWDEN

Abolition of Saturday classes will be the subject of a refer-
endum set before the student body on Wednesday. The refer-
endum, sponsored by the Executive Committee, will investigate
student opinion on a five day class week.

Voting will take place in the Freshman Dorm Quad, Wash-
" —————<—=i ington Hall and in the Law School.

The polls will be open from 8:30
a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The voting in the
Quad will be supervised by the
Freshman class officers, Dave Craw-
ley and John Thiemeyer.

Debate Changed

A debate, organized at the request
of the E.C., will explore the relative
merits of this question tonight. The
debate, originally scheduled for 8
p.m. in duPont auditorium, will be
held in Newcomb 8 at 7:00 p.m., due
to a conflict with another program.

Speaking in favor of abolition of
Saturday classes will be Dave Mar-
chese and Rusty Meyer and in oppo-
sition will be Bill Grant and Jim
Hamill. The W&L Debate Team
sponsoring the program.

A spokesman for the EC expressed
the hope that students will fully
consider the consequences of the ab-
olition of Saturday classes. This
move would impose an increased
work load on students and in addi-
tion, scheduling adjustments might
result in 90 minute classes, after-
noon classes or both. Discussion of
tomorrow's referendum has ben car-
ried in the last two editions of the
Ring-tum Phi.

Should the referendum show that
a significant portion of the student
body is in favor of a five day class
week, the EC will submit a recom-
mendation to the Faculty Committee
,on Courses and Degrees by whom
the final decision will be made

Richard Nash, Sophomore EC Rep-
| resentative, is in charge of carrying
peo the referendum.

Discusses Lindsay Victory

 

(Editor’s Note: The author of | John Lindsay’s victory in
this article worked last summer as
Assistant to the ‘
York State Congers-

|
|

At long last the fac ulty has corrected what could only have

been called a gross bureaucratic inefficiency.
the new Student Affairs Committee has accomplished two signi-
ficant reforms in the existing faculty committee structure. First,
the faculty has given for the first time voting membership on
any committee to four students, and more importantly, it has
eliminated the overlapping and duplication inherent in the pre-

vious system.

Although the student voting power is not pre ponderent, it
apparent that student influence will weigh heavily in the
deliberations of this new body. are convinced that this

group will provide a practical and stile forum for the con-

duct of student affairs.

In applauding the efforts of the faculty in this area, it is ”
opinion of this newspaper that this marks the beginning of «
new era of progressive action. We only hope this spirit will
manifest itself in other ways throughout the entire University

community.

Dirty Boab Should | Be Unlimited
Expose Truth About Fraternities

By NICK RUFFIN
In the Friday edition of the Ring-
tum Phi a columnist complained of

suasion known as
“dirty rush.” He
argued that dirty
rush is immoral,
dishonest, and un-
gentlemanly. If
dirty rush is not
controlled the fra-
ternity system at
Washington and
Lee may be elim-

Ruflin inated according
to his predictions.

 

Apparently dirty rush has caused
undeclared hostilities to break out
among fraternities. Yesterday, as I
walked out Washington Street, I
heard wild cheering coming from a
fraternity house. I paused to listen
is the cheering reached a fenzy,
“HATE, HATE, HATE, HATE!” Ap-
parently dirty rush has caused some
fraternities to adopt hate breaks as
part of their rituals. These militant
activities are obviously preparations

for the predicted Snow Ball War

The Friday columnist obviously
iad strong feelings about dirty rush
Sour grapes over a few lost pledges
might even have clouded his think-
ing. What the columnist may be ad-
mitting is that his fraternity is not
as good at dirty rush as are some
others

As rush week is now arranged, it

almost impossible for a freshman
to find out anything about the fra-
ternities except what the fraternitie
want him to know. In a rush date
everyone the freshman meets
friendly to him, sometimes sicken-

ngly so. The freshman hears of the |
vonders of each house; how brother |:

Bill will loan you his Ferrari fo
read trips, how the house had Ray
Charles for two closed parties last
year, how the house food was fea-

hated . For these reasons, the May-
or never becomes governor. But

j only seven Republican members, and
both the Council President, and the

By TOM CARPENTER ‘

 

I wish to thank Drew Baur for taking over the sports page
for me last week while I was holed up with my advertising book
at the request of Mr. Paxton Davis. Drew did the layout and
wrote the headlines, and B.S. column, despite what the byline
on the latter may have stated. I feel I have to correct this error
in order to allow credit or blame, as the case may be, to fall
on the man responsible. Actually, the B.S. column was sup-
posed to be accredited to Dick DeWaugh. If you ever see this
byline on a story, you will know that this story is the work of
Drew Baur.

This highly treasured award goes to Anson Mount, the college |@

urday’s loss to number one ranking Michigan State. Iowa
reached the ultimate depth the previous week when the Hawk-
eyes were defeated by the Hoosiers of Indiana, 21-17. The
Hoosiers usually consider it a successful season when they win

 

one Big Ten Conference game.

If Coach Barnes is lucky, he may even be head coach at
Iowa next season. And the Hawkeyes are supposed to have |
three All-American offensive players, led by quarterback Gary |
Snook afd flanker Karl Noonan.

After watching the Lexington-Buena Vista game Friday,
Shaun Donahoe and I decided that Coach Lee McLaughlin
could learn something from the two high school coaches. |
Buena Vista tried a screen pass up the middle, while Lexington
had a variety of odd plays that had not been seen recently by
the Tuesday staff columnists. Buena Vista also had a fake punt |
play that was very clever. The center hikes the ball to the |
blocking back who takes off for the end zone, while the Lex- |
ington defense is still looking for the punt. Why doesn’t W&L |
add a little life to its attack with such clever tricks? Spectators |
like variety in football, something that is not seen at Wilson |
Field unless the visitors’ coach is a man of imagination.

Shot Putter Turns Quarterback

Did you know that the world’s heaviest quarterback is here
at Washington and Lee? Take a look at Phi Kappa Psi’s field |
general at their next intramural football game, and you will
see Ted Larson, who is better known as Tubey. He weights in at
about 250 pounds and can throw the ball as far as any pro
quarterback. Against Phi Kappa Sigma in a 0-0 game with
about 10 seconds left Tubey told his receivers to head for the
end zone and look for the ball to split the uprights. It did and |
Bob Aldrich caught it for the winning touchdown. It added |
up to about a 60 yard pass in the air. The world’s heaviest |
quarterbac ks with one of the world’s longest passes.

| yet not strong enough to deliver a
scoring punch.

Roanoke’s’ game strategy was to
place five men in their backfield,
which allowed W&L’s halfbacks and
insides to control the game. This was
an essential factor in the resulting
scoreless tie.

The General's primary opportunity
came with one and one-half minutes
in the game on a penalty kick. How-
ever, the attempt was stopped by the
opposition’s goalie, thus advancing
the contest into overtime.

Special recognition in this game

ball control. Furthermore, Redmond,

Generals Lose

Someone should propose a system
N.C.A.A. which would de-
termine the victor of a football game,
not by the score, but by the statis-
tics. If such a system had ‘been in
effect last Saturday, Washington and
Lee would have been credited with
a win, instead of a heartbreaking
6-0 loss to Sewanee on the winner’s
NS

Sewanee took the opening kickoff
and marched 60 yards for the lone
score of the game. Aided by two
crucial penalties and three pass
plays, the Tigers’ march was capped
when Bill Johnson went the final
two yards for the score. At this point
Washington and Lee made some ad-
justments in the defense which was
to stymie Sewanee for the remainder
of the game. But they came too late
as the Tigers had scored the points
necessary for victory.

The Generals’ offense outgained
Sewanee’s offense, but Wé&lL could
not come up with the big scoring

| play which would have given victory
| to the best team on the field that
| day. John Anthony continued his as-

sault on the school rushing record
as he gained 115 yards over what
was regarded as a sturdy defensive
line.

W&L’'s final chance for a score
came with six minutes left in the
game when Rudd Smith recovered
a Sewanee fumble on the Tigers’ 38
yard line. But the big play never
materialized, and W&L saw a very
bitter and frustrating game end.

The Generals’ defense was up to
par as they stopped Sewanee’s of-
fense except for the first drive. Jamie
Andrew led the fine trio of line-
backers in halting the Tigers as he
intercepted his second pass of the
season and generally made life mis-
erable for the Sewanee backs, in-
cluding the highly touted Johnson.
Little Billy Andrews was not too
gentle with Johnson either has he
made a solo tackle on him that left
the Tiger star unconscious for
half hour.

Near the end of the game W&L
showed how staunch its defense is
as the offense, vainly trying to score,
the ball to Sewanee on the
W&L seven yard line instead of
punting on fourth down. Here the
defense came in and after four
downs had pushed Sewanee back 35
yards. This was typical of the way
in which the Generals played all
afternoon, but all they have to show

Stacton To Speak Again

Author David Stacton, Glasgow
Visiting Professor at Washington and
