EC Restores Fining Power
For Assimilation Committee

Fining power was returned to the
Assimilation Committee as a means
of enforcing conventional dress and
dates were announced for the spring
elections by the Executive Commit-
tee in an extended meeting Tuesday
evening. The EC has not as yet de-
cided when the new Assimilation
policy will go into effect, and has di-
rected the present Committee to
continue until further notice with
the same procedures it has followed
this year.

The move toward active enforce-
ment of the dress tradition came af-
ter a motion, by junior representa-
tive Bill Jeffress, to maintain the
committee without enforcement
powers, failed by a 6-4 vote.

Jeffress Motion Fails

Jeffress’ suggestion would have
eliminated the “reporting” system
for violations, but would have em-
powered the Assimilation Committee
to bring before it any freshman on a
first offense or constant upperclass
violators “for the purpose of secur-
ing his cooperation in maintaining
the traditions of speaking and con-
ventional dress.” In the proposal, the
Assimilation Committee could not
have referred violators to the EC.

After this failed, proponents of
enforcement of the tradition

Springs President Mike Saunders
and Dance Board Vice-President
Tommy Cox have announced that
the Marvelettes and “Smokey” Rob-
ingon and the Miracles will perform
at the Dance Set’s Friday evening
concert, April 15.

Both groups represent one of the
most “popular” of popular-music
sounds, Detroit’s Motown. Their ap-
pearance on Springs Weekend will
be the first for each at W&L. To-
gether, they bring a combination of
success and talent which is consid-
ered to be unprecedented here for a
single concert.

he Marvelettes began their career
with Motown in 1962, and since then
have been at the top of the charts

consistently. Their million-sellers
include “Playboy,” “Please, Mr.
Postman,” “Beechwood 4-5789,” and,

most recently, “Don’t Mess With
Bill.” Their albums, all on Hamala
Records, are “Playboy,” “Marvel-
ous,” “Please, Mr. Postman,” “Smash
Hits of ’62,” and “The Marvelettes’
Greatest Hits,” released this past
February and including all four of
their biggest singles.

Their appearances at other col-
leges have brought unanimous ac-
claim: “The Marvelettes take words
and music and balance them in a de-
lightful and pleasing manner...;”
“They and the Supremes are per-
haps the only rock singers who can
please any type audience, from the
transistor-radio-at-the-beach set to
the sophisticated, expense-account
patrons of the night club circuit.”

Bill “Smokey” Robinson, as well
as being lead vocalist with the Mira-
cles, is a prominent composer and
lyricist, having written such songs
as “My Girl” and “The Way You
Do The Things You Do.” When he
appears with the Miracles, in the
words of Motown President Barry
Gordy, Jr., the result is a combin-
ation of “the unique natural gift of

The political forum will be held in
the back room of the College Inn
every Monday night at 8:00, starting
on the second Monday after spring
vacation, While sponsored by the
W&L Young Democrats Club, all
interested persons are urged to at-
tend. There will be no entrance or
membership charges, and those who
attend will be expected to pay for
nothing except their own beer.

The forum will present definite
political topics for open discussion
and will bring in speakers and dis-
cussion leaders. The first subject for
discussion will be “The Politics of
Protest.” A planning committee is
being formed by the Young Demo-
crats to decide on future topics,
some of which may be: the admis-
sion of Red China to the U.N., Am-
erican diplomacy in developing na-
tions, Viet-nam, the dilemma of the
Democrat in the South, and the civ-
il rights movement teday

On April 18 or 19, the W&L Young
Democrats Club will join with the
Randolph-Macon club to bring Mr
Sargent Reynolds to the forum as a
speaker. Reynolds is

Minin Critic
Denies Freud’s

Rex Complex

At the Fifty-Fourth Washington
and Lee Seminar in Literature, Mr.
Francis Fergusson, professor of
comparative literature at Rutgers
University, presented a lecture en-
titled “Oedipus According to Sopho-
cles, Cocteau, and Freud.”

The lecture in duPont Auditor-
ium at 8:15 p.m. March 22, dealt
with Sophocles’ King Oecdipus,
Freud’s modern concept of the Oedi-
pus complex, and Cocteau’s play The
Infernal Machine.

Mr. Fergusson indicated that the
original Oedipus in Sophocles was
merely a man who was destined by
the gods to kill his father and mar-
ry his mother. Oedipus tries desper-
ately to find the truth of the whole
situation and when he finds that he
has followed the prophecy, he takes
his punishment as a hero. There is
nothing “hidden or suppressed” in
the play to indicate a psychological
nature such as the Freudian Oedi-
pus complex.

According to Mr. Fergusson, to-
day’s people tend to think of Oedi-
pus in terms of Freud's complex, but
the more intensive reader can see
in the story that Oedipus is control-
led by circumstances. He does not
realize that Jocasta is his mother
and as a matter of fact, ran from his
home so that the prophecy would
not come true.

Freudian ideas come from actual
cases. When reading the play, one
can see, in some respects, a parallel
to Freudian analysis. First Oedipus
is confused. He feels threatened but
realizes that he must uncover the
facts concerning the death of the
King of Thebes. He starts with the
easily accepted facts and gradually

Two Youths Jailed Fined
For Attacks On Students

Two Rockbridge County youths
have been sentenced and fined as the
result of charges brought against
them to the Lexington Municipal
Court by three W&L students and a
local merchant.

Wayne Lee Carter, 20, of Buena
Vista, and Gerald Allen Rhodes, 18,
of Glasgow, were brought before
Judge William A. Romans last Tues-
dal, March 22.

Carter, found guilty on two
charges of assault and battery and
three charges of cursing and abus-
ing, was fined a total of $355 and
sentenced to a six-month jail term.

Rhodes was found guilty on one
charge of destroying property and
two charges of assault and battery.
He was sentenced to 120 days in
jail—although the sentence was sus-
pended—and fined $130 and court
costs.

NOTICE

Dean William W. Pusey, II], has
announced that the speaker for
W&L's Phi Beta Kappa-Cincinnati
Day Convocation, April 12, will be

The incidents from which the
charges arose began about 6 p.m.
on Wednesday, Feb. 15, when the
two men attacked sophomore Mike
Spector outside the B&F Lunch and
attempted to seize his umbrella.

They fled after an exchange of
blows.
Shortly afterwards, Carter and

Rhodes met freshman Danny Woods
in front of Adair-Hutton and chased
him to the Old Dormitory after tak-
ing his hat.

The two entered the pool hall on
West Nelson Street, where they be-
gan abusing proprietor Adolphus
Davis after tearing the telephone out
of the wall so that he could not call
police. The final victim of the at-
tackers was Bob Brenner, who had
his glasses taken and was struck
four or five times. After this inci-
dent, which occurred in the Metho-
dist Church parking lot, Brenner ran
to the SPE house and called police,
who finally arrested Carter and
Rhodes in George's Tap Room.

Commenting on the outcome of

the trial, University Proctor Bob
Murray said that the sentences
handed down to Rhodes and Carter
would “make people think twice”
before assaulting Washington and

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Friday Edition

Generous Decision

The Ring-tum Phi thanks President Cole for his prudent
and generous decision to return the Southern Collegian con-
troversy to the Student Affairs Committee.

 

It is our hope that this action will ameliorate the insulted
parties representing both views and allow adequate investiga-
tion and debate of the Collegian issue.

Love

During the past few weeks there has been a great deal of
controversy about Conventional Dress and in a larger sense
about the traditions upon which this university was established.
The pleas by members of the student body either in support of
or against the established code of deportment have failed to
recognize the major issue involved.

The major issue involved in this dilemma is love. This word
is not intended to have any romantic connotations but rather
it is to convey a spirit which the members of the University
feel towards themselves and towards the University. This spirit
of love is not present at W&L and for this reason the tradi-
tions are generally being eliminated.

Some people believe that subsidized athletics would re-
store this love of the University. This, however, is not neces-
sary. Alumni, who attended W&L after subsidized athletics
were abolished, have impressed me with their strong love of
the University. One alumnus in particular stated that he would
not consider sending his son to any school other than W&L.

This attitude certainly does not exist now. At the present
time indifference is the prevailing attitude. It is considered
studly to remain aloof and for this very reason the traditions
are decaying.

This situation is not hopeless. There are solutions to this
problem but the solutions will not be easily accomplished. It
will take a concerted effort by the members of the student body
who have a sincere love of the University to instill this spirit
in the other members of the student body.

There are four sources which can be used to restore this
former attitude. These sources are: the fraternities, the student
leaders, the faculty, and the individual students themselves.

Since this school is fraternity oriented, the fraternity can
play an important role in the restoration of a positive atmos-
phere within the University. The purpose of the fraternity is
to instill its members with the desire of excel. The fraternities
at W&L for the most part have failed to fulfill their responsi-
bility. This deficiency can be overcome if the leaders of the fra-
ternity activity encourage the members to participate in the ac-
tivities of the fraternity and the activities of the University.
With all the members working for the betterment of the fra-
ternity and in a sense the betterment of the University a large
step can be realized toward a better spirit among the students.

The student leaders should set an example which the other
students want to follow. They can do this through enthusiasm.
(Enthusiasm in this sense is not to be confused with fanati-
cism.) If the leaders of the campus enthusiastically support this
University, other students are going to want to follow their
example.

The faculty can help bring the students together by en-
couraging the students to get in contact with them. Personal
relationships between the students and the faculty can make
the educational experience richer for both the faculty and the
students.

Finally each student has a responsibility to himself and to
the University. He represents a university which was founded
on high ideals, ideals which will hold a man in high esteem
wherever he may go. It is his duty to preserve and cherish the
ideals which he is fortunate to be able to represent.

If these approaches can be carried through, the difficulties
which we have encountered will be removed. We realize that

 

these changes will not come immediately. All we ask is that
everyone takes it upon himself to try to correct the situation.
If everyone does, W&L will again become an institution which

S.P.M,

everyone will love and be proud to represent.

Editor’s Note: This story is part
of a series of features designed to
locate What W&L Lacks The Most.

By STEVE MILLARD

“A ten-point, long-range program
embracing faculty, students and cur-
ricular changes and designed to
make Washington and Lee eventu-
ally ‘the  out-
standing teaching
institution in the
country’ was ex-
plained today...
following a
Thursday _ after-
noon presentation
to faculty mem-
bers.”

My eyes can be
somewhat less
than reliable at
times, so I looked
again. Yes, there is was, still staring
me in the face—a front-page article
in the Ring-tum Phi, heralding a
series of revolutionary changes at
staid old W&L. I leaned back for a
moment and let my imagination en-
joy itself. “This is today’s paper,” I
told myself contentedly, “and good
things are in store for The House
That Lee Built.” Then my sense of
the ridiculous belched in protest, and
I took a second, sobering look at the
date: November 25, 1947.

Reform Zeal—1947
Nineteen years. A whole truckload

world’s longest concrete
pension footbridge in far less time.
As a matter of fact, it must be down
there; nobody seems quite able to
locate it anywhere else. And, no mat-
ter how foreign the thought may
seem, we need it in the worst pos-
sible way.

But now, out of the dim back-
ground, we hear a chorus of angry
voices—or are they just bored?
“Stop tearing everything down and
look at the good.” “This school
draws its strength from tradition,
not wild reform.” “Straighten your
tie, mister.” Truly, the philosophers
rule.

It takes no unusual effort to fall
into the prevailing pattern of exis-
tence. It takes no particular spark to
be satisfied with a measure of “good”
and to ignore a host of nagging de-
ficiencies. It does take something a
bit out of the ordinary to place an
individual or an institution among
those “sublimely cursed by discon-
tent.” The chorus of indignant self-
satisfaction which greets every pro-
posed fluctuation of the status quo
has little in common with this “ten-
point, long-range program.” Among
its then-radical proposals, by the
way, we find the senior thesis, com-
prehensive examination, and inde-
pendent major, Today, we respect
these programs as integral parts of
the curriculum; it should be borne
in mind that their origins cannot be
traced to the custodians of Things

As They Are.
Curse of Reform—Here?

Imagine for a moment that the
curse of reform fell upon Washing-
ton and Lee. How would these sub-
versive minds work? What guiding
principles would’ direct their
thoughts and produce their recom-
mendations?

Above all else, the chances are
that such agents of doom would tend
to be generalists. Their primary con-
cern would be with the proper goals
of a university and the extent to
which Washington and Lee realizes
these goals. As a further considera-
tion, they would have to examine
such characteristics as size and loca-
tion, since these determine the spe-
cific way in which the larger aims
ean best be fulfilled

If all this appears hopelessly self-
evident, stop and ask yourself how
often it actually oceurs. Think back
the endless discussions, sup-
cosmic but

upon
posedly in
pheral in reality, which masquerade
as meaningful analysis. Then tackle
a really difficult task into a
new role and play the game by these

intent peri-

slep

; i
open and freewheeling rules

What follows is my own excursion

 

 

 

into this untraveled area. The spe-
cifle answers are there for consid-
eration, but are themselves ix im-
portant than the approach It asks
that you dispense with the idea that
any particular tradition or “image”
eonnected with Washington and Lee
is essential to its best rest lt

of reforming zeal can go under the |
non-sus- |

 

ed to one idea: a university exists
to develop excellence of mind. This
involves the transmission of atti-
tudes as well as facts, the develop-
ment of wisdom beyond knowledge.
It does not involve the extra-curri-
cular idea of a “gentleman”; except
for the gentlemanly outlook which
ought ideally to develop as a conse-
quence of liberal education, this
concern has no proper place among
the goals of a university. We often
hear reference made to the state-
ment of Robert E. Lee: “We have
but one rule here—our students are
gentlemen.” The General would
probably storm out of his grave if
he knew that this valid and flexible
rule had been subtly transformed
into a university goal,

Now Let’s Measure W&L
We now have a yardstick with
which to measure a multitude of
sins. As an example, let’s apply this
goal to that most explosive of con-

 

temporary issues, the conventional
dress question. When Mr. Awad at-

tempted similar larceny in a recent
column, the effect was remarkable;
apparently the thought was so ob-
vious that it had eluded everyone

else.

Viewed in this perspective, the
entire debate assumes a sadly mean-
ingless character. One side attempts
to find a correlation between the
clothes on my back and the thoughts
in my head—an endeavor which
speaks none too well for somebody’s
conception of the mind. Another side
insists that the tradition is dying
and asks that we recognize the fact—
a valid enough contention, but one
which sidesteps the main point.

The truth is that a prolonged de-
bate over How We Shall Dress, to
the exclusion of everything else con-
nected with the University, is noth-
ing short of asinine. Admittedly, it’s
a sad necessity if new paths are to
be followed; nevertheless, the ad-
vocate of change must eventually
confront the absurdity of this per-
petual symposium.

 

Ponder Your Right To Destroy .. .
Assert Your Right To Grow, Build

But now the chorus returns,
bringing still another pet argument.
“Do you see mature, successful
businessmen wearing sweatshirts?
You have to make your way in the
world, and college is your prepara-
tion. This silly association of sweat-
shirts with intellectuality is thought-
less and immature. Grow up.”

Clothes and Intellectuality
This is surely the unkindest cut
of all. In the first place, there is no
association intended between any
clothing and intellectuality. There
is also a more fundamental question
suggested by this argument—the
curious and widespread concept of
college and its opportunities as in
some final sense a business venture.
True, we all need the diplomas.
True, we pay for a service. Now go
back to our statement of the prim-
ary goal here: to develop excellence
of mind, That, brethren, is no busi-
ness venture. It’s more like a cos-
mic game. We spend a large por-

(Editor's note: This is the fourth

American citizens who live and
work in the Panama Canal Zone are
often criticized at home and some-
times attacked in
Panama for main-
taining their Am-

to the exclusion of
Panamanian civi-

The Republic of Panama is a crea-

The numerous small stores sell

Dear Mon and Dad,

Well, the weather is upon us and
the true tubemen will be found ev-
afternoon out at Goshen. To
make the appeal
of tubing even
stronger than _ it
already is, we
have decided to

also the rest of
the student body.

It is our plan to

s of records so that
we may begin a Tubing Hall of
Fame. Why not, I mean after all

there’s one for everything else.

Anyone feeling that he holds any
sort of worthy record, or knowing
of anyone who does, please send
notice to either the Friday Edition
or to this columnist.

Should sufficient interest in the
subject be shown, the Friday Sports
Staff will consider duplicating its
recent highly successful Trivia Con-
test by sponsoring a Grand Tube
Race, from Devil’s Kitchen to the
Wires. The Town of Lexington has
already been notified so that it can
begin planning ways to keep the
blood out of the town water supply
should the event be held.

All sturdy paddlers

The usual bottle of champagne

ners and/or survivors. A special Don
Lineback award for the Persever-
ance in the face of Difficulty will be
awarded for the contentant who
travels the farthest distance down
the river in a state of unconscious-
ness. (The student for whom the
prize named holds the record,
having gone from Niagara Falls al-
most to the head of the Chute after
receiving a first-rate concussion in

Stickmen Lose Two;
Coach Lauds Efforts

By RON KESSLER

Washington and Lee’s inexperi-
enced lacrosse team lost its second
game of the season Wednesday to
Yale University, 14-6. The Yale
squad was unquestionably stronger
and more experienced, sporting 16
lettermen and 18 seniors to W&L’s
10 lettermen and three seniors.

The Generals played a much
stronger game then they did Mon-
day against Swarthmore, losing 7-4.
According to Head Coach Dana
Swan, the team “improved in many
areas. We scored six against a much
better team.”

The first quarter went relatively
well for W&L. The squad played a
good defense, and tied the score at
2-2 on goals by senior Jay Bower-
sox and Hugh Baugher, with four
minutes left to play. Yale jumped
ahead in the last minute of the
quarter on a goal gy All-American
Bradford. The second quarter was

in Yale action dominated entirely by Yale, scoring
x five goals, three in the first two min-

In the third period the Generals
seemed to settle down and regroup
their forces. Senior Bruce Jackson,
in a tremendous effort, dug in and
scored two goals in as many min-
utes. The Yale team then seemed to
find itself again, and finished off the
quarter with three more, holding
W&L scoreless for the remaining 13
minutes.

Jackson scored his third goal in
the opening minutes of the fourth
quarter and was quickly followed by

play. Yale re-awoke, and finished off
the game scoring three goals, the
last one the fourth of the game by
Cobridge.

On W&L’s side, Bruce Jackson
dominated the game, scoring three
goals in five attempts. Tom Pittman
put forth a good effort, screening
several outside shots, and goalie
Dave Johnson played an excellent
game, making 17 saves.

Co-captain Lance Bendann did a
fine job on defense, keeping Yale’s
Bradford from exploding. Freshmen
Clint Murchison, Bart Goodwin, and
Joe Wich played ample games and
showed promise for the future.

Statistically speaking, Yale shot
14 for 47 while Washington and Lee
went 6 for 24. Yale picked up 35
ground balls, W&L 21. In the Gen-
erals’ weakest statistic, Yale went
2 for 9 in extra man opportunities,
while W&L was 0 for 5.

Commenting on the game, Coach
Swan stated, “We were disappointed
at the margin of the score. I didn’t
feel that it was a 14-6 ballgame as
far as the difference between the
two teams went. Our largest problem
was in extra man opportunities; our
clearing also was inconsistent. When
Yale started scoring in that third
quarter, our inexperience gave us

tion of our four years here tackling
subjects of precious little “practi-
cal” significance, in the pursuit of
something just a bit finer. The spirit
of this endeavor, in the words of
Richard Hofstader, “a spirit of ‘play-
fulness’—~a sense Of sheer delight in
activity of the mind.”
Appropriateness Forgotten

In case anyone has forgotten the
fact, clothes vary in accordance with
their appropriateness. We accept the
businessman’s suit as appropriate to
his function, and the manual labor-
ers outfit for the same reason. In
the game of education, I defy anyone
to tell me what is universally func-
tional. I would also request that the
tradition-oriented resist the tempta-
tion to inform me that coats and
ties are functional here because we
accept them. Obviously, an increas-
ing minority does not accept them;
conceivably, the group may even
have perfectly good reasons.

In any the insistence upon
one form of dress or another is a
useless distraction from the real con-
cerns of this university. Therefore,
I would simply offer the revolution-
ary proposal that classroom wear be
dictated by whatever happens to be
comfortable. Beyond that, it just
doesn’t matter.

Now the chorus of voices sounds
more weary than ever. “Will you go
away?” “This place just doesn't need
that kind of change.” “Good God,
a respected university.”

It is indeed. And it will most as-
uredly not continue to be respect-
ed, if we cling to traditions and ed-
ucational practices which have
ceased to be productive and mean-
ingful. The ideals which unite a
University are not based on out-
moded myths, but on working reali-

Americans cannot reasonably be ex-
pected to abandon their habitual
way of life for the squalid, degrad-
ing conditions of the Republic.

While aware of the social prob-
lems in Panama, the Vema scien-
tists found it almost impossible to
keep from being “ugly Americans.”
We found that in simply wearing
casual street clothes, carrying tour-

t cameras, and making modest ex-
penditures, were displaying os-
tentatious wealth by Panamanian
tandards.

There is, of course, no ready solu-
tion to the Panamanian resentment
for the Canal Zone and for Ameri-
cans. The canal cannot feasibly be
staffed by some self-sacrificing or-
ganization as the Peace Corps, and
American technicians would leave
if they and their families were made
to live like Panamanians. My im-
pression is that only by raising the

ards of Panama can a real accord

ties. We appear to stand at a cross-
roads, where the old is losing its
eharm and the new has yet begun to
assert itself. In the transitional void,
too many students seem to share the
opinion of one highly intelligent and
highly disillusioned sophomore:

“Some schools are so bad that you
never know what you're missing.
Some are so good that you can really
have an_ intellectual experience.
W&L is right in the middle; it’s
just good enough to make you real-
ize what you've missed.”

Needed: A Reforming Spirit

If ever we neded a reforming spir-
it, the time is now. We need to ap-
ply all phases of university life to
the goals dismissed earlier—not in
an isolated “self-study” program,
but in an entirely different approach
to university life. Mr. Ruffin is right
when he lists the role of “innovator”
as a logical one for schools such
as ours; beyond that, however, it is
a crucial role for this school, right
now.

Let’s cite a final example. When-
ever the “integration question” aris-
es, we hear that W&L will welcome
a qualified Negro, but that we should
wait for one who applies because
he honestly feels a “compatibility”
between his goals and the W&L ex-
perience.

I disagree heartily. We should ac-
tively seek this qualified Negre. If
we can dig up a qualified Saudi
Arabian along the way, fine. A truly
diversified student body is an intel-
lectual experience in _ itself—one
which we can and should seek to
develop.

This is the approach we need and
lack. Place yourself under the guid-
ance of our natural and necessary
goals. Play the role of reformer and
see what happens. I repeat what was
said earlier; my answers are there
for consideration, but the method
is indispensable. “Ponder your right
to destroy and maim...” and then
assert your right to build and grow.

the details of an experience where
he killed a man return and he real-
izes, with the aid of witnesses, that
he fulfilled the old prophacy.

Cocteau’s The Infernal Machine
was described as more Freud-like
than the Sophocles play. In it, Oedi-
pus and Jocasta are on the verge of
discovering the truth, but tell each
other lies so that they will not real-
ize they are parent and child.

In his closing comment, Mr. Fer-
gusson stated, “Freud and what he
thinks can never take the place of
the play. We need to re-capture the
old tradition presented in the play
by Sophocles.”

President Fred Mindel opposed
this measure, but had no vote in the
matter, as he may only break ties.
“In addition the system has worked
very well this year,’ Mindel com-
mented.

The members who agreed with
Mindel throughout the voting were
Bob Lee, Mike Hash, and Bill Jeff-
ress. Kirk Follo voted against the
motion to strengthen the Assimila-
tion Committee, but voted for the
schedule of fines because he felt “it
was the best system of enforcement
we can work out—if we have got
to enforce the tradition.” Sophomore
representative Richard Nash voted
in favor of the motion to strengthen

the Committee, but opposed the spe-

Sam Hinkle, Al Byrne, Jerry Turn-
er, and Joe Framptom were the
members of the bloc who desired
enforcement.

The Committee encountered less
disagreement when it turned to set-
ting the dates for spring elections.
Unanimously, the members voted
the following calendar for the Big
Four election: President, Vice-Pres-
ident, Secretary and President of
Fancy Dress.

Election Dates

On Monday, April 11, each candi-
date must submit a petition with
150 signatures to Joe Framptom by
6:00 p.m. On Tuesday, April 12, there
will be an open meeting of the stud-
ent body to allow candidates to
briefly state their views. On Wed-
nesday, April 13, primary elections
will be held to reduce the number of
finalists for each office to two. No
primary will be held if no more than
two men have filed for an office. On
Monday, April 18, the general elec-
tion will be held.

The system for Class officers and
EC representatives is similar to the
Big Four elections on Monday, April
25, petitions with 50 signatures are
due to Joe Framptom by 6:00 p.m.
On Wednesday, April 27, the prim-
ary will be held, and on Monday
May 2, the general election will take
place. Law school elections will
be held entirely on ‘the night of
May 2.

Who Are These
UNITARIANS
AND UNIVERSALISTS?

Unitarians and Universalists be-
lieve the striving to live nobly and
constructively more important than
the accepting of religious creeds.

Unitarians and Universalists are
convinced that religious truth can-
not be contrary to truth from any
other source.

Unitarians and Universalists offer
a religious program for children and
adults of all cultures, with reason
as our guide, and service as our aim.

They further believe that “the
great end in religious education is
not to stamp our minds irresistably
on the young but to stir up their
own.”

Hear: Munroe Husbands of the
Unitarian Universalist Association
speak on WHO ARE THESE UNI-
TARIANS AND UNIVERSALISTS?
at 8:00 p.m, Monday evening, April 4,
1966 at duPont Auditorium, Wash-
ington and Lee, Lexington, Virginia.
