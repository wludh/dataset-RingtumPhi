 

Montgomery, Saunders Head Ring-tum Phi

The publications Board elected the
editors and business managers of the
Ring-tum Phi and the Southern Col-
legian at its meeting yesterday in
the Student Union. A photography
editor was not selected due to the
absence of applicants.

Warren Monutgomery, a rising
senior Sigma Chi from Memphis,
Tennessee, and Steve Saunders, a

rising junior SPE from Elmont, New
York, were chosen editors of the
1966-67 Ring-tum Phi. New business
manager for the campus newspaper
will be Bob Priddy, senior Phi Kap
from Richmond, Va.

Jim Crothers, KA from Rising
Sun, Md., and Tox Cox, Phi Kap
from Richmond, Va., were selected
for the positions of editor and busi-
ness manager of the Collegian re-
spectively. No other decision was
made regarding the Collegian. Drew

 

Baur, former editor and current
president of the Publications Seiad,"
is due to speak at the next Faculty |

meeting to urge reconsideration of |
the decision to cut off Collegian
funds,

The appointment of Saunders was
a marked departure from past prac-
tice, which dictated that only ris- |
ing seniors be considered for Editor-
in-Chief of the 65-year-old Ring-
{um Phi, It is only the third time
in thirty years that a rising junior |
has been elected.

Montgomery served this past se-
mester on the Friday staff as feature |
Editor. A geology major, he spent
two semesters on a Pacific cruise
as part of a Columbia University |
scientific expedition, returning in|
January 1966. Montgomery also has |
served as house manager for his
fraternity.

A Quick Response

The proposed amendment to the student body constitu-
tion permitting write-in candidates is precisely the revision we
called for last week. If adopted this amendment will not elimi-
nate the petition requirement, but it will insure that every vote
cast for a candidate will be counted as valid.

In our view this amendment contains an essential reform.
The fact that our constitution does not provide for write-in
candidates indicates a degree of irresponsibility on the part of
its authors. The time is certainly long past for a complete
evaluation of the student body constitution to include cor-
rections and additions. The last revision of this document was
made in September, 1962, which unfortunately resulted in
a number of technical errors as well as structural inadequacies.

Although the Executive Committee endorsed unanimously
this proposed amendment, it still requires a simple majority
of the entire membership of the student body. Members of
the student body will be given the opportunity of enacting this
reform during class elections next Monday. We wish to urge
the passage of this revision in the interests of a more democrat-

ic election procedure.

 

Congratulations!

Congratulations to the new editors and business managers
of the Ring-tum Phi and the Southern Collegian. The publica-
tions Board faced with an unusually large number of well qual-
ified applicants, had a particularly difficult time making a final
decision. We trust that the new editors will be able to carry out
their programs for next year, and continue to provide a repre-

sentative student forum.

 

Rider Views Liberal Man,
One Who Has Eye Trouble

By BRUCE W. RIDER

This week, if you are still with us,
we will present Part Two of our
exciting series on
_ conservatives and

liberals. A careful
reading of last
week’s column will
show that we dis-
cussed the conser-
_ vative man. Thus
it seems only fair
and right (or left)
that we take a lit-
tle look at the
liberal in this, the
concluding portion
of our lucid study.

The liberal man is on the left
because when he gets his way noth-
ing is left to individual initiative. Un-
like the conservative, the liberal
is full of imaginative plans for the
immediate improvement of all man-
kind; New Deal, New Frontier, Great
Society. (The liberal is called ‘liberal’
because he has to be liberal with
everybody's money to pay for all of
these schemes.)

It must be noted that liberals
are very poor mathematicians. Very
few, if any, liberals have figured
out that to get one dollar back from
Washington you have to send three.

Liberals, as opposed to conserva-
tives, don’t mind people who are
different from themselves. They are
often willing to learn from such peo-
ple. For example, liberals have ob-
served good Moslems praying to-
ward Mecca each day. A good lib-
eral does the same, except that he
bows and prays toward Washington.

A liberal is much like a maiden
Aunt. Always so interested in other
people's affairs and wanting se much
to help .

Liberals have alsolutely no sense
of the past. Before the liberal him-

 

self came upon the scene, nothing
had ever been done to lessen pov-
erty and ignorance. Things must be
corrected now, at once, by a Federal
plan. (The liberal is called a man
of the ‘left’ also because after all
of these great plans are paid for no-
body will have any money left.)

A liberal just can’t let anything
be. “We have to integrate. We have
to educate. We have to eradicate.”
It is tempting to wonder just why
the hell these people care so much.

The conscience of the liberal is
very, very tender. A man of another
hue living a thousand miles away
who is denied a cup of coffee—what
anguish this causes the liberal. Not
only that: he thinks (would you be-
lieve it?) that it is his own fault.

The liberal has taken upon him-
self the sins of the world. The uni-
verse is a mess—and the liberal
feels guilty because it is. Therefore
he rolls up the sleeves of his ex-
pensive shirt and Gives of Himself
to eradicate the ills of man. Today.
Tomorrow for sure.

One of the physical ailments of
the liberal concerns his sight. He is
far-sighted. Thus he can live in New
York and see clearly the social
wrongs in Alabama and feel he must
go there right away to set things
straight. His eye trouble keeps him
from seeing that something is rotten
in the state of New York.

Our two-party study of conserva-
tives and liberals now concludes. We
might note that these two kinds of
people do have something in com-
mon: while the conservative fears
the liberal who may be hiding under
his bed, so too does the liberal fear
the conservative who may be under
his bed.

Only the moderate gets a good

 

night's sleep.

Independent Study Plan and Flexible Exam Schedule Favored

 

Rick Carson

Any candidate for a representa-
tive office must recognize two very
basic things at the outset—his pre-
rogatives and his limitations, which
are established by the responsibilities
inherent in the office. As a candidate
for the Executive Committee, I be-
lieve and believe firmly in my ability
to recognize these boundaries, and
therefore, to be an able representa-
tive for the class of ’69.

My prerogatives and my respon-
sibilities cannot be separated, though,
because each is a principle of the
other. For example, it is my pre-
rogative to vote as I see most fit,
but this prerogative is accompanied
by my responsibility which I have to
allow the opinion of the majority of
the class to decide how “I see most
fit.” Other of my prerogatives, each
accompanied by a responsibility, in-
clude the interpretation of issues as
I understand them, presuming my-
self to be worthy of judging my
peers in the event of an Honor Trial,
and, perhaps, encompassing more
than any of the others, having con-
fidence in my ability to be an ex-
emplary representative of my class
and of my college. And if I did not
feel as I do regarding these pre-
rogatives and responsibilties, I would
not contend for your vote.

To be more specific, my platform
consists of two cardinal principles:
the preservation of our traditions,
and more student freedoms. I believe
in conventional dres, I practice con-
ventional dress, and I encourage all
students at Washington and Lee to
do the same. Note that I said en-
courage, not force. 1 make this dis-
tinction because I don’t believe a
tradition can be perpetuated by coer-
cion. As for student freedoms, I ad-
vocate among other things a more
flexible exam schedule, more student
determination in the choice of cours-
es, freer use of the Student Union
facilities, and most important of all,
the encouragement to all students to
implement their opportunities in the
Self-Study Program.

In effect, I stand for liberal legis-
lature for the benefit of the stu-
dents, conservative principles be-
cause we have something worth con-
serving, and sound reasoning to
govern all my actions because if
elected, Washington and Lee reflects
in part my decisions.

 

Doug Hall

Throughout this year we have been
bombarded with articles stressing
what is wrong with Washington and
Lee. I think self-criticism is a good
thing and is necessary for our im-
provement, but I would like condi-
tions to provoke a series of articles
on what is right with Washington
and Lee.

The Executive Committee has an
integral part in controlling these
conditions. Since this committee rep-
resents an increased amount of stu-
dent interest, I think it should be
given more of a chance to work
with the administrators in forming
the policy of the school. This would
not only increase the importance of
student opinion but would also help
the student-faculty relationship. I
believe that increased attention paid
to the students by the faculty will re-
sult in important cooperative de-
velopment.

The following are a few of the
ideas that I think should be given
careful consideration by the E.C.
next year: the adoption of an Inde-
pendent Study Program; a regular
lecture series by our own professors;
a more flexible exam schedule; and
the possibility of having a reading
week preceding exams.

I believe the acceptance of these
proposals would pave the way to
a more cohesive and progressive
university.

Sam Hinkle

As president-elect Bill Jeffress
put it, the Executive Committee and
the student body have come of age.
Part of that new maturity is en
awareness of Washington and Lee's
weaknesses as an instrument of edu-
cation. It is time to commit ourselves
to action. We, as students, murt take
a responsible, critical attitude to-
ward Washington and Lee. Our goals
should include an active Executive
Committee to present student views
effectively.

The most important qualification
for an E.C. representative is his at-
titude. The student body's new
awareness should be encouraged vig-
orously, As evidence of my posi-
tion on student affairs, I offer these
proposals for consideration

One ungraded class per semester
should be offered. This is a needed
relief from the present grade-con-

 

 

scious system, and an encouragement

of learning for learning’s sake. Our
grading system needs revision to in-
clude pluses. A student committee
should be organized to work with
the faculty in evaluating teachers
and courses of study. Too many
classrooms are locked each_ night.
This valuable study space should
be made available to the students.

A project I have worked on this
year is a flexible exam and hour
quiz schedule, where no one is
forced to take two exams in conse-
cutive exam periods or two hour
quizzes on the same day. I would
like to carry that work to comple-
tion. Next year, polls conducted by
the E.C. should be binding. Care
will be taken to word ballots clearly,
so there will be no misunderstanding
by the E.C. or the faculty what the
students want.

The Executive Committee should
develop a feasible plan to eliminate
Saturday classes and present it to the
administration. Perhaps continued
agitation will achieve results. The
presidents and vice-presidents of
the classes should be encouraged to
assume more leadership in student
affairs. Candidates for these offices
have campaigned on such a platform
for years. With cooperation from the
E.C., improvement is possible in this
area. We need a vigorous student
government. I would like to take
part in creating it.

Fran Lawrence

Washington and Lee has a proud
past and nationally famous tradi-
tions. And yet, like so many other
members of our class, the Class of
1969, I cannot disregard the future,
I cannot accept W&L only for what
it was or what it is now. Next year’s
E.C., and indeed next year’s sopho-
more class, must lead the student
body in reevaluatiing old values and
solving old problems. In short, we
must ask WHY? WHY is there stu-
dent apathy in almost every phase
of campus life? WHY is there a gap
between what student leaders feel
is best for the university and what
the administration feels is best?
WHY is there a growing discontent
in the student body because of in-
ability to express and effect its
ideas?

The answer to these and many
other problems can be found through
careful evaluation, through asking
WHY. And, where change is de-
manded, change must come. I do not
advocate blind and irrational change,
or change for changes sake. Rather,
we must first continue the work of
certain members of the 1965-66 E.C.
and the LF.C. in a thorough exam-
ination of every phase of W&L life.
A complete knowledge of the prob-
lems can give us insight into possible
solutions. But, these solutions must
be tried. They must not go the way
of N.S.A., of girls in the upperclass
dorms, of liquor at university dances,
of a needed and demanded substitute
for the Assimilation Committee. They
must not take the path Independent
Study is already on.

We cannot constantly strive to
maintain the status quo. We cannot
continue to believe “It is therefore it
is right.” Washington and Lee to re-
main the outstanding small college
it has been must once again be a
leader among colleges. We must
initiate new ideas in education and
student life that others strive to
emulate, not wait for another uni-
versity to hand it proven idea over
to us. Let us not ask whether an
has been proven. Rather, let us prove
it.

I stand for ideas based on an ex-
amination of present institutions;
strengthening those worthwhile, re-
viving from the past those we might
well use today and discarding those
no longer beneficial or effective.

John Schechter

The Executive Committee must
serve as a backbone for the student
body. It must be flexible and respon-
sive to new and original ideas while
at the same time sturdy and rigid
in presenting its policies, thoughts,
eriticism, and recommendations to
the administration.

One of the major concerns of the
EC is the fostering of student in-
terest and concern in University af-
affairs. The Executive Committee
should strive for more participation
in and support of the ODK forum.
I propose that the E.C, minutes be
mimeographed with copies made
avalible in the Student Union. This
would serve in addition to those al-
ready posted on the colonnade.

 

Copies of the student body constitu-
tion should be given to incoming

 

freshmen and made available to
students throughout the school year.
Open E.C. meetings should receive
more publicity through such media
as the Ring-tum Phi, posters, and
notices on the E.C. bulletin board.

The E.C. should be receptive to
new ideas and willing to explore any
conceivable possibilities towards nec-
essary changes. I strongly support a
Junior Year Abroad program. A cur-
riculum committee should be es-
tablished to express student opin-
ion on courses and grading. I feel
there should be a more flexible
policy toward both final exams and
and hour quizzes.

With an informed student body
comes a concerned student body and
a concerned student body promotes
an active Executive Committee.

John Thiemeyer

In running for the E.C., I wish
to present a platform resting on four
fundamental concerns. First, as Vice-
President of the freshman class, I
established, with the aid of some two
dozen other boys, a Pep Club whose
objective is to gain support for
activities representative of W&L
and particular W&L athletics. Plans
are being made for next football
season for a regular schedule of
rallies prior to home games, the
organization of cheering sections
at games, and the introduction of
bugles, cowbells, and garbage cans
(stimulated with sticks) as aids to
cheerleaders.

Second, I propose a review of the
endowment program. Even in view of
W&L’s financial limitations resulting
from the fact that we are not a
state school and from the necessary
depreciation of such things as the
admissions program and maintain-
ence; W&L stands in depressing con-
trast to many schools of her caliber
with regard to athletic and dormitory
facilities.

Third, I would work toward closer
ties between the E.C. and students.
This objective could be accomplish-
ed by the introduction of student
subcommittee made up of students
and one (or more) E.C. member.

Finally, I advocate development of
the Student Union. This proposal,
not to be confused with a de-empha-
sis of the fraternity complex which
is essential to W&L, would see the
development of more recreational
facilities and a review of the “women
in the dorms” controversy.

Pleas Geyer

When one thinks of the Executive
Committee, its duties as an honor
tribunal are usually foremost in one’s
mind. This is probably due to the un-
fortunate fact that, in the past, the
Executive Committee has been little
else. It is my belief, however, that
the execution of justice under the
honor system is only a small, albeit
exceedingly important, facet of the
Executive Committe’s obligation to-
ward the student body of Washing-
ton and Lee, for the E.C. should
also be an active legislative body,
proposing reasonable and much
needed reforms in academic, social,
and traditional matters and subse-
quently working diligently with the
administration for their implementa-
tion.

In the academic realm, such ob-
jectives as liberalization of penalties
for overcutting and the creating of a
faculty-student board to hear appeals
on behalf of students who have over-
cut would be worthy of considera-
tion. Also deserving investigation are
the proposals concerning ungraded
courses, independent study (on an
optional, rather than compulsory
basis), and a junior year abroad.

As for social reform, the E.C.
should work for the speedy crea-
tion of sorely needed lounge facil-
ities and probe into the practicality
of reasonable dormitory visiting
hours. In this area also, the E.C,
should enthusiastically support such
projects as the construction of the
new Student Union which would fa-
cilitate the establishment of better
relations between the fraternity and
non-fraternity men at Washington
and Lee and, therefore, create a bet-
ter integrated, more harmonious, and
more efficient student body.

Lastly the E.C. should be gravely
concerned by the perilous state of
Washington and Lee's unique, and I
believe, valuable traditions. Moder-
ate changes in this area could quite
possibly save them from imminent
extenction. Conventional dress, for
instance, could be made less odious
and more practical by the broadening
of definition during the hot fall
and spring months. At the same time,
the Executive Committee should try
diligently to revive a tradition which
has already succumbed—the Seuth-
ern Collegian. Perhaps the Collegian

did at times overstep the limits of

endurance, but it did not deserve
the hasty and summary liquidation it
received. A referendum on the ques-
tion would undoubtedly be valuable
in persuading the administration
to reconsider and should be con-
ducted by the Executive Committee.

 

Roddy Roediger

During the past year the most
disappointing thing which I have
noted concerning the Executive
Committee is its lack of direet con-
tact with the students. I have talked
to many people who have very sound
ideas, but no way to express them.
I believe that the representatives on
the Executive Committee should
make a more pronounced effort to
keep in touch with the students that
they represent and find out what
they are thinking.

There are a number of things
which I personally believe could
be done to improve both the intel-
lectual and social atmosphere at
Washington and Lee. Chief among
these is the new independent study
plan which has already been worked
out by the Executive Committee.
This plan, if used correctly, would
greatly improve the academic at-
mosphere and would probably be-
come the school’s most outstanding
academic characteristic. Another
thing badly needed here is a reform
in the University Cooperative.

A new building is being built, but
the main thing that needs changing
is the management. As everyone
knows, the textbook prices are out-
rageous and the selection of paper-
back books is miserable. One thing
which is needed for social improve-
ment is the elimination of Saturday
classes on big dance weekends. An-
other is the reinstatement of the
Southern Collegian.

If I am elected, I cannot guarantee
that all of the above will be done,
but I shall lend my support to these
proposals in all ways possible.

Dave Stovall

As a candidate for the office of
Sophomore Representative on the
Executive Committee, I have a duty
to present my views on issues at
Washington and Lee. First of all,
there is a need for election reform,
as illustrated by the lack of interest
in the recent student body elections.
Alternatives to the present system
would be explored. Secondly, a more
flexible exam schedule is needed.

Thirdly, I propose that a dormitory
committee be established consisting
of the head dorm counselors and the
freshman class officers to handle dis-
ciplinary problems. Next, the EC
should take the responsibility to
make certain that the new co-op and
Student Union plans will be carried
out for the student's benefit. I ad-
vocate exploring the possibility of
drinking at school dances. Finally, I
strongly support the tradition of
conventional dress. However, as a
tradition it should not be enforced,
but should be voluntary.

If elected, I will work for the ac-
complishment of as much of this
platform as possible. I will also try
to represent the views of the stu-
dent bedy and will appreciate any
suggestions or ideas. Finally, I am
prepared to devote the time and ef-
fort necessary for the fulfillment of
the office.

Richard Nash

I am glad to have this opportuni-
to formally announce my candidacy
for Junior Executive Committee
Representative. In the past year, as
Sophomore Representative I served
on the Student Union Committee,
conducted the study on the possibili-
ty of no Saturday classes, worked
on the possibility of a change in
the grading system, helped orientate
the entering freshmen, worked on
the revision of the ODK Forum,
served as an advisor from the E.C,
to the Independent Study Program,
submited suggested ideas for work to
the members of the Student Control,
Assimilation, Cold Check, and Li-
brary Control Committee, held sev-
eral class meetings, and conducted
several polls.

Next year, if reelected, I plan to
continue the legislative aspect of
the Executive Committee. I want to
propose a floating exam schedule,
enabling students to pick their own
time for taking exams; a junior year
abroad; and a possible division of
the Executive Committee into an
Honer Council and a Legislative
Branch. Further investigations
should alse be made on student
evaluation of courses and professors,
girls in the dorm, conventional dress,
and election procedures

Yet while keeping these reforms in
mind as important to Washington

Johnson, Bowersox Prove
Mettle in Past Four Years

That lean stud of a Delt on the
green bicycle with the ridiculous
knot in his tie is Lee Johnson, senior

gut-it-out man for the track and
cross-country teams.
From Louisville, Lee came to the

town on the Maury with intention
of playing football. He quickly de-
cided to concentrate on running
after a brief diversion in swimming.

It was in the spring of his fresh-
man year that Johnson began his
assault on the Washington and Lee
track. His time of 4:37 in the mile
more than earned him his letter.

He didn’t run cross-country
his sophomore year but was an in-
stant success. Pairing this sport with
track Lee has become one of W&L’s
most valuable runners. By the time
he graduates, Johnson will have
amassed seven letters, while having
served as captain of both the cross-
country and track teams this school

Saturday Washington and Lee’s
lacrosse squad dropped a home game
to Towson State, 6-4.

Critical defensive breakdowns on
the part of the Generals which were
turned into scores by the opportun-
istic Towson team were the makings
of the defeat. The opposition’s stand

and scored three goals and three
assists.

Washington and Lee entered four
men into the scoring column. Terry

scored one. Joe Wicke had two as-
sists.

ing. Terry Griffin was also mentioned
as having improved his game.

Failure to take advantage of extra
man situations, the Generals only
scored in one of twelve of these
situations, and sub-par riding and
clearing, an aspect they have always
previously executed well, were
thought by Coach Swan to be large
factors in the defeat.

The team was showing some tired-

of playing above his freshman stand- |

Billy Andrews and Lance Bendann,

together in the next three games.

and Lee life, we must remember
that they are only secondary to the
main function of the Executive Com-
mittee. The primary responsibility
is the conducting of honor trials.
For this task, the E.C. needs mem-
bers who are responsible, serious
and of sound judgment. The enforce-
ment of W&L’s honor system is not
a responsibility to be lightly given
away.

In the last two years I have sat
on nearly thirty honor trials con-
cerning a great variation of viola-
tions. It is evident that this valuable
experience enables me to be better
prepared and equipped to handle
future trials.

For two years I have striven to
actively represent our class on the
