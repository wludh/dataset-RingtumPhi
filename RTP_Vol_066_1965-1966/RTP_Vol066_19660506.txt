Dean Farrar Announces 342 Freshmen Accepted

Director of Admissions James D.
Farrar announced this week that
342 students have confirmed their ac-
ceptances at W&L, to enter this
September as the Class of 1970.

“As best I can feel,” Farrar told
the Ring-tum Phi, “this fall’s enter-
ing freshman class is one of our
strongest ever.” A specific profile of
mean College Board scores, public-
private secondary school distribu-
tion, and North-South geographical
representation will not be completed
until the beginning of the summer,
he added, but aside from the un-
usually impressive academic calibre
of the class, he does not expect that
these characteristics will change
greatly.

A total of 1,412 completed appli-
cations were received this year—
from “students sending in their ten
dollars,’ not merely the letters of
enquiry that some colleges consider
“applications.” This year’s figure is
some eleven per cent below last

WEEKEND WEATHER

Mostly fair skies through tomor-
row, with a low tonight of between
52 and 67; cooler tomorrow, with
a high of from 72 to 77. The outlook
for Sunday: some cloudiness, and
cool.

 

year’s when some 1,599 students ap-
plied. “When the number of appli-
cations was down a bit in February,”
Farrar said, “I began checking,” and
found a similar pattern showing up
at most colleges and universities in
the South and Northeast, including
UVa., Davidson, Vanderbilt, Mary
Washington, and the Ivy League
Schools.

Dean Farrar attributed the slight
decrease in numbers of applicants
to a levelling-off, “or perhaps an
actual decrease,” in the size of this
year’s high-school senior class in
general, due in turn to a drop in the
birth rate in the late forties.

A marked increase in the quality
of secondary school guidance coun-
selling is an equally important ex-
planation, Farrar continued. Coun-
sellors are no longer, it seems, urg-
ing students to apply to schools at
which they have no_ reasonable
chance of acceptance. Multiple ap-
plications, which “give admissions

 

directors nightmares” to begin with,
are being played down. Where a stu-
dent just a few years ago might
apply to six or seven schools, he
now is encouraged to select three
or four “more realistic” choices.

The war in Viet Nam does not ap-
pear to be a factor in W&L’s ap-
plications decline, he said. “The
calibre of students for admittance
to W&L are not in general affected
by the draft.” The war is, however,
being cited by some other colleges
in explaining their declines. “We
simply are receiving fewer and
fewer applications from weak stu-
dents.”

Beginning in March, the Admis-
sions Committee sent out 625 let-
ters of acceptance, compared with
635 last year. Of the 342 students
who confirmed by Monday of this
week, which was the Candidates’
Acceptance Date agreed upon by
most colleges in the country, 330

Magyar Editor
Here Monday

Ivan Boldizsar, editor of The Hun-
garian Quarterly, will speak on “The
Image of the United States in Hun-
gary and Vice Versa” Monday, May
9, at 8 p.m., in Reid Hall 203.

In addition to being a journalist,
Mr. Boldizsar is a distinguished
novelist and playwright. He is Depu-
ty President of the Hungarian PEN.
Club, and member of the Council of
Societe Europeenne de Culture.

He was born in Budapest in 1912.
His literary career began in the
thirties, when he participated in
what was called the “village re-
search movement,” which endeavor-
ed to inform and arouse public
opinion on the living conditions of
Hungary’s “three million beggars.”
This movement inspired his first
book, Tibore, published in 1936, a
collection of the biographies of thirty
landless peasants.

After the war, Mr. Boldizsar was
editor of several newspapers and
weeklies. For a time ,he served as
Under-Secretary of State in the
Hungarian Foreign Ministry.

In recent years, he has produced
three novels, From This Morning
to Tomorrow Morning, Night's End,
and Birthday, plus several volumes
of short stories, plays, and film
scenarios.

Mr. Boldiszsar refers to his two
latest editions, Relatives and Strang-
ers and Doing England with a Gi-
raffle, as diaries. Both have been
best sellers.

His most recent drama, Bread and
Wine, dealing with marriage and
friendship at the time of the Sham
Political Trials during the Stalin
period, will be produced in Buda-
pest this year.

He is the first Hungarian transla-
tor for Franz Kafka, and has also
translated works by Aldous Huxley,

The junior-class prose Award went
to Ward Briggs, from Montchanin,
Delaware, for his second consecu-

describes the relationship between a
man and woman over a period of
thirty years—from childhood,
through early adulthood, and into
maturity. Stuart described its theme
as “domination and denial.”

Steve Greenia, of Charlotte, North

EC Eliminates Assimilation Fines,
Will Expand Role of Orientation

The newly elected EC. met
Wednesday night to set Committee
policy for next year.

The E.C. by a unanimous vote
adopted a comprehensive change in
Assimilation Committee policy to
go into effect in September.

Steve Saunders appeared before
the committee to submit a proposal
for a reorganization of the Assimi-
lation Committee. Kirk Follo pre-
sented the “Traditions Committee”

proposal, which had been considered
and rejected by a 6-5 vote by the
E.C. in March. Saunders proposed
that the A.C. take comprehensive
and full responsibility for freshman
orientation and enforce the tradi-
tions during the rest of the year
through encouragement and, ulti-
mately, through fines and possible
stronger action. To orient freshmen,
Saunders proposed that the A.C.

In order to further Washington and

to extend oneself into the communi-

to buy sight unseen every rumor

State’s Attorney
Defines 3.2 As

Virginia's Attorney General Reb-
ert Y. Button ruled this week that
the sale of 3.2 beer on Sundays in
Craig County is legal, although a
county ordinance specifically pro-
hibits it,

The potential effect of the ruling
is considered to be far wider-
reaching than in Craig County
alone. One prominent W&L faculty
member has commented, “this is
ene of the few decent rulings from
My, Button.” A spokesman for the
Acoholic Beverage Control beard
stated that localities cannot in fact
limit or restrict the sale of 3.2
beer at all, because according to
Commonwealth law — lew-proof
beer is considered to be non-aleo-
holie

if the ruling should be brought
into effect in Rockbridge County,
then beer could be sold unres-
trictedly met only on Sundays, but
also afier the 11.00 pm. end of
the alegholic-beer-selling day: and

His proposals also provide that there
be no reporting system of dress vio-
lations, but that committee members
could call before them frequent vio-
lators and fine them, if necessary.

The “Traditions Committee” pro-
posal provided that the A.C. should
serve to orient freshmen at the be-
ginning of each year and should
continue during the year to encour-
age the traditions, calling frequent
violators before it if it desired. There
would be no reporting system of
violations. In this proposal, how-
ever, the A.C. would have no re-
course to fines or punishment of
any kind.

Vice-President Kirk Follo moved
that the E.C. adopt the essentials
of the Traditions Committee propos-
al, but to incorporate into it Saun-
der’s idea of an expanded role for
the A.C. in freshman orientation.
The specific methods of this expand-
ed role were left to be determined
at a meeting next week. Therefore,
there will be no fines or enforeement
next year.

Richard Nash moved that the E.C.
put no limit on the number of stu-
dents to be appointed to the A.C.

unanimously.

In other action, the E.C. decided

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association

Friday Edition

An Unfortunate Start

During its first official meeting, the newly-elected Executive
Committee virtually destroyed the Assimilation Committee as
a means of effectively maintaining Washington and Lee tradi-
tion.

To quote the official E.C. notice “no fines will be imposed
on violators but (Assimilation) Committeemen will meet with
frequent violators to secure their co-operation, through persua-
sion only, with the tradition.” We find this statement either
incredibly naive or incredibly cynical.

An Assimilation Committee reduced to the function of
“encouraging” miscreant students will probably be a farce, and
it will almost certainly be ineffective. Futhermore, the new
E.C. has totally abrogated the recent policy set by the outgoing
1965-66 E.C., without giving that policy the slightest chance
to prove itself one way or another.

In so doing, the new E.C. has compromised the Executive
Committee as a reliable and continuous institution and has
gone against a majority, however slight, of student body opin-
ion. Furthermore, it has eliminated any real means of en-
forcing conventional dress.

We feel that the new Executive Committee has started its
term of office in an exceedingly unfortunate manner; how-
ever, the quality of its newly-elected members is such that it
will hopefully act with more discretion as it becomes more ex-
perienced.

The Honor System ‘‘Poll”

Another Washington and Lee tradition has come under
attack during the last week. The nominal honor system poll
published last Tuesday by senior Executive Committeeman
Bob Lee is one of the most shocking articles to have appeared
in the Ring-tum Phi in the last four years. It is shocking in
that the writer implicitly presented as fact a series of highly
questionable statistics pertaining to the honor system, and it
is shocking in that if these statistics are at all valid, then Wash-
ington and Lee’s venerable and cherished honor system is in-
deed “in sufficient trouble to warrant our attention.”

 

 

Mr. Lee’s article states that twenty-eight per cent of those
polled admit to having “violated what you conceive to be the
spirit of the honor system.” Over fifty per cent of those polled
claim to have “witnessed an honor system violation and failed
to report it.” Over seventy per cent of those polled consider
“unjust” the absolute penalty for honor violation.

But are these figures accurate? We doubt it. In the first
place, the poll included less than 3 per cent of the student
body. Even such a meager survey might be plausible if taken
impartially and at random, but it was not. Mr. Lee’s poll was
taken of 42 juniors and seniors in only three fraternity
houses. It should not be necessary to point out at length that
W&L fraternities exhibit certain collective characteristics, and
that no three of them could be representative of the general
student opinion.

Finally, the poll’s wording was often ambiguous and sub-
jective. In the case of the first question, for instance, what is
really meant by a violation of “what you conceive to be the
spirit of the honor system?” This question could have meant
several different things, ranging from “Have you cheated?”
to “Do you consider yourself a perfect person?”

It is likely that the poll’s statistics are inaccurate and mis-
leading; nevertheless their publication represents the only sta-
tistics presently available on the state of the honor system.
Dubious as they might be, they are still capable of under-
mining the mutual student-faculty and student-student trust
which now exists on this campus. If only to correct the prob-
able wrong impressions engendered by the poll, it has now be-
come necessary to conduct an objective and campus-compre-
hensive referendum on the honor system.

Margolies Says W&L Lacks Courage
To Adapt Itself To Modern Society

By RICK MARGOLIES

Washington and Lee lacks cour-
age. It lacks the courage to admit
that now that society has changed,
it must change also—or become an
anachronism. It lacks the courage to
apply programs successful at other
institutions to itself—I am _ not
advocating change for the sake of
change but—there ARE  progres-
sive things being done in education
today.

Washington and Lee’s lack of cour-
age results from fear. This fear
be valid and worthwhile change be
cen be labelled don’t rock-the-boat-
ism. Each group fears speaking out
about what it believes would be
valid and worthwhile change be-
cause of the possible disapproval
and reprisals by the group above it.
This results in a fear of change,
starting at the top of the university’s
hierarchy and permeating down-
ward. I am sure that President Cole
is aware of what is going on in edu-
cation today and I am even confi-
dent that has seen the potentialities
for worthwhile change at Washing-
and Lee. So why is he silent? Why
no public statements? Why does he
not get involved with student affairs?
I can only conclude, assuming that

he is aware of the potentialities, that
he fears what the conservative Board
of Trustees might say or do if he
speaks his mind. If this be the case,
and I and others believe that it is,
then I can only second Mr. Sen-
nott’s recent suggestion that he re-
sign. A leader must lead,
Faculty’s Fears

Similarly, the faculty fears the
Administration, the Board and public
opinion. Faculty members don’t get
“involved” because they are too
concerned with their own tenure
and personal prestige. I am confi-
dent that the faculty, drawn from
many parts of the country and itself
educated at diverse colleges and uni-
versities, has also seen the possibil-
ities for constructive change at
the university. Yet no voice is
heard. For example, when was the
last time that a faculty member
wrote to the newspaper, which at
most schools is a sounding board for
ideas, and expressed an opinion on
a matter of the academic communi-
ty’s concern? Are we to assume, for
example, that there is not one opin-
ion either pro or con by a faculty
member as to the proposed fund to
help attract Negro students to Wash-
ington and Lee? I have not heard

 

 

 

one publicly stated faculty opinion.

The student, of course, is the most
fearful member of the community.
This fear stems from his all-consum-
ing concern with grades, rather than
with making himself an aware and
open-minded individual. If the lat-
ter were truly his objective he would
constantly be involved in issues of
university concern, not to mention
the current issues facing society gen-
erally. But unfortunately, the stu-
dent is too concerned with self-
gratification and self-advancement to
get involved. If he holds an opin-
ion he resists the urge to express
it for fear of alienating his profes-
sors, whom he believes might alter
his grades if he “offended” them.

Merely Perpetuating

This fear to speak out, to take a
stand, this don’t rock-the-boat atti-
tude has a very bad effect on the
university: 1) it results in a lack
of creative thinking and a lack of
a spirit of innovation among the
faculty and especially in the admin-
istration. The administration, by re-
fusing to innovate and recognize the
value of creative change has stag-
nated this university. Washington
and Lee is standing still, merely per-
petuating the same system and the

Letters To The Editor

 

Readers Get Things Off Chests

Revive Political Parties?

Friday Ring-tum Phi

Contrary to the attitude expressed
by the editorial in the Tuesday edi-
tion, there seems to be a definitely
unhealthy campus atmosphere that
is able to produce only one candi-
date for President of the Student
Body

The old two-party system, despite
all the inequities of the clique sys-
tem by which each party determined
its slate, at least did produce two
qualified candidates to contest each
position. While I do not personally
favor a return to cliques, I do feel
that some sort of revival of campus

political parties should be given
consideration
With only one candidate on the

ballot for President, I fail to see the

same values it always has had, while
the world prograsses before its eyes.
It is necessary to challenge values
to see their real worth. But Wash-
ington and Lee perpetuates rather
than challenges. This brings me to
my second point.

2) This fear of innovation has
eaused Washington and Lee to lose
sight of its identity and its purpose.
The administrators have lost sight
of what the university is all about
because they are too deeply invol-
ved in everyday machinations of
running this particular university.
This narrow-mindedness results in
motion without direction .

Role of Fraternities

This narrow-minded approach to
Washington and Lee’s problems was
made most vivid to me recently when
I attended a Self-Study meeting on
fraternities. The first question on
the agenda, what is the role of
fraternities in the goals of this uni-
versity, was quickly passed over
to get to “more important” questions,
such as deferred rush. The first
question, however must be answered,
for it is the basis upon which the
fraternity system exists here, the
basic assumption for all further dis-
cussion of fraternity affairs.

A dean was asked what the actual
role of fraternities is in the goals of
the university and his first response,
offered in jest I am sure, was that
fraternities provided a legal place
for students to drink. When it was
pointed out that students have sexual
intercourse with girls and the uni-
versity doesn’t provide a place for

, that everyone laughed and the dis-
| cussion left the actual roles of fra-
‘ ternities to revert to the narrower
‘and more specific issue of deferred

rush. But again the question was

| raised: what is the roles of fraterni-
| ties in the goals of the university,

to which the dean finally admitted
he did not know and suggested that
possibly the student should tell him!

It seemed to me that this is a good
example of a member of the adminis-
tration losing sight of the goals and
purposes of this university. It is
particularly shocking when you real-
lize the enormity of the incident:
85 per cent of the students belong
to fraternities and spend a major part
of their time enmeshed with them
yet a Dean and several members
of the faculty could not justify their
existence here, except by repeating
several times that they are “an in-
tegral part of the university.” Say-
ing that they are here doesn’t say
whether they should be here.

Lee Syndrome

And what do we have in place of
creative thinking, now that we have
lost sight of the goals of the univer-
sity? We have, gentlemen, the Lee
Syndrome. It arises from the acute
inability to deal with the future
and results in oppressive obession
with the past. It seems that Robert
E. Lee, his horse, his family, and as-
sorted in-laws are buried in Lexing-
ton and for this honor the university
must spend every minute perpetuat-
ing his ideals. These ideals are social
standards of acceptability: be, look,
and act a gentleman. And so the Ad-
missions program looks for socially
acceptable boys, those with courte-
ous reply and neatly-rolled tie. But
a university should be concerned pri-
marily with the state of a person's
mind, whether he is aware and cur-
ious, whether he thinks or just par-
rots back fact—and this is something

that is not reflected in machine-
graded college board tests. If we
stopped emphasizing the social

standards of admissions process and
in the education offered we might
not end up with the homogeneous,
moneyed consumers of La Dolce Vita
we have now. Which is not to say
they are not bright—they are—
but they don't use their potential
to think, they are not intellectually
committed

But to return to the Lee Syn-
drome, I offer the Alumni Magazine
as an example. The main articles
in each concern themselves
with speeches by the president or
faculty (usually about Lee) or the
problems of maintaining the tradi-
tions at Washington and Lee in a
much-changed world. In fact, the
next issue features an article about
the relationship of a certain Lexing-
tonian with Lee himself! I think that
we could learn from the
Johns Hopkins University Alumni
Magazine, which devotes itself solely
to articles of current events and is-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Bridgewater, Old Dominion
Fall to General Racketmen

By JERRY PERLMAN

Washington and Lee’s powerful
tennis team had to come from be-
hind yesterday to edge upset-mind-
ed Old Domiinon 5-4 in a match,
at Lexington. This was the Generals
second win of the week, having
easily downed Bridgewater 9-0 on
Wednesday. These two wins boosted
the racketmen’s record to six and
one, their only loss having been to
UVa. last Friday.

Yesterday’s match was the tight-
est of the netmen’s season, With the
match score tied at 4-4, things were
looking shaky for the Generals as the
number one doubles duo of Tommy
Rueger and Ray Turman dropped the
second set of their match 12-10, hav-
ing won the first set 6-3. But behind
strong serving and precision net play,
Coach Canfield’s freshmen whiz kids
won their third set 6-3, giving Gen-
erals victory number six.

Old Dominion came to Lexington
with a definite handicap. Their
strong number one singles player,
George Consolvo, was nursing a
sprained ankle suffered in a match
on Wednesday and had been dropped
to the number five slot. His injury
was immediately felt, as Rueger easi-

Forces Of Evil
Defeat Batmen

On Tuesday the Generals baseball
team suffered a 12-4 defeat at the
hands of the clutch-hitting Lynch-
burg diamondmen. Although W&L
was out hit only 12-9 the Lynch-
burg men smashed three triples to
tally the victory.

Pitcher Seais led the attack with
two triples and seven RBI's. Tommy
Mitchell, three for four, and Jim
Wilson, two RBI's, were the only
productive Generals.

Coach Lyles said, “We played as
well as they did but just didn’t have
the extra base hits at the crucial
times. That has been our trouble all
year and we have only three boys
hitting over .200.”

Tomorrow the W&L nine jour-
ney to Bridgewater against a team
that earlier defeated them, 2-1. Bill
Rasmussen pitched a fine game and
hurled a five hitter. Lyles hopes for
better hitting support tomorrow.

“At the beginning of the season
it was cold and lately there has
been so much rain that the boys are
having trouble getting any continu-
ity in their games. Tomorrow's game
should be a good one.”

Next Monday the team will host
RPI in a doubleheader starting at
2:30.

The victory was followed by team

win at the number two singles spot
and undefeated freshman Ray Tur-
man’s 6-2; 6-2 triumph at number
four,

What had started as an easy W&L
victory, though, soon became an ex-
tremely tight match. Junior Phil
Thompson, after taking the first set
of his number three singles match,
dropped the next two 6-4; 6-2. Wick
Vellines, holding down number six
slot, could not get his game cranked
up and dropped a 6-1; 6-3 decision;
and Drew Baur, playing number five,
found a rugged Consolvo determined
not to let his injury hamper him,
and the lanky junior from St. Louis
wound up on the short end of a 7-5;
6-0 score.

With the score now tied at three
matches apiece, Canfield sent his
three doubles team onto the courts.
The netters from Norfolk soon
jumped into a 4-3 lead, as the Gen-

Dear Mom and Dad,

It’s hard to write a column when
you have no material; its harder
when in addition you're sick and feel
like going to bed. But the show must
go on, only by now there’s one less
inch to fill.

Congratulations to basketball coach
Verne Canfield. It seems that he
has scored another
victory in the re-
cruiting war, with
the signing of Mel
Cartwright, the
All-Stater from
Martinsville who
led his team to
the State Champ-
ionship.

Cartwright, a 6’

dent, and was given an academic

scholarship (do we have any other
kind?)—and_ also

an anonymous
grant (yes, we do!)

By the way, my close association
with Sports Illustrated has paid off
again. About three weks ago I pick-
ed Graustark to win the Derby. Well,
somehow, I feel that he isn’t going
to make it.

When the cavalry charge is over
tomorrow (for those of you who
don’t follow the “Sport of Kings,”

 
  

 

 

that is a reference to the largest field
in years), “Albe’s Hope” has as good
a chance to be in the winner’s cir-
cle as anyone else.

Some guys have married to avoid
the army. Others have decided to
stay in school. Some just keep break-
ing a leg. Well done, Mr. Dennery,
well done,

Speaking of broken bones, there

Well, Bill DeWitt seems to have
made the “Big Trade That Shouldn’t
Have Been Made of the Year,” In
return for an “old at thirty Frank
Robinson” the Reds got.. well, they
got somebody,...I think.

But the Orioles got Robby, and
they’re delighted. Between he and
Brooks, very few people remember
the “M Boys.” Just think what Bal-
timore could do if they had Floyd
Robinson. Then they could have a
different Robinson batting second,
third, and fourth. But they just
might not need three; it seems that
two are doing quite well.

Turning to the Majors, there must
be something to Warren Giles, but
it sure isn’t smarts.

CAMPUS
FASHIONS

ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

THE TRANSITION T0 SPRING gradually releases us all from our

musty Winter hang-ups. The state-of-seige atmosphere on campus
diminishes as the thermometer rises, and overnight that term paper
you’ve been dreading falls into place. Spring is also the proper time
to think about shifting your wardrobe in the direction of the warm

weather months ahead...

LIGHTWEIGHT, EASY-CARE: these are the

watchwords in tailored apparel. Crisp, cool fab-
rics with built-in wrinkle-resistance and/or per-
manent press features are now standard, The
color story for Spring focuses on BLUEGRASS,
a blend of vibrant blues and sparkling greens.
It should rank as a top color consideration in
selecting all your Spring/Summer apparel. A
pin wale-cord suit, for example, in a lightweight
. cotton/polyester blend, or a classic Natural
Shoulder seersucker suit in a BLUEGRASS
blend are excellent choices. Lightweight, double-
breasted blazers will introduce a whole new
spectrum of colors. But before purchasing, look
ahead: is this a summer geared for absolute
relaxation, a summer job, or, if you're graduat-
ing, your entry into the business world next >
Fall? Make your selection accordingly.

 

“AWAY FROM WHITE” ‘That phrase charac-

 

terizes the gradual phasing out of the classic
white dress shirt. Today, color predominates,
and blue leads the pack. Look also for a wide
range of soft pastel shades, both solids and
stripes; they blend perfectly with the new
Spring suits. Many of these color-toned dress
shirts incorporate permanent press features,
Another trend worth noting: the button-down
collar sans buttons, Collar points are slightly
longer, the buttons disappear altogether, and
the buttonless button-down may be worn with
or without a pin,

ACCESSORIES MAKE THE MAN, and you couldn't get off to a

better start than by selecting one of the new Summer straw hats.
Time was when Memorial Day marked the date for turning in your
winter felt and bringing out your summer straw. Today, any time
the weather's right, the time is right. The classic boater with its
flat top, relatively narrow brim, and colorful ribbon band remains

were Frederick M. Mindel and
Joseph H. Framptom. Univeristy
President Fred C. Cole presented
the awards and gave a brief resume
of both students’ contributions to
Washington and Lee. The award
carries with it a cash stipend of
$100 to be divided between them,
plus an adidtional stipend of $150
to be given to a campus organiza-
tion of their choosing. After the
banquet, Mindel had the following
comment: “I feel that any contri-
bution I have made to Washington

benefits I have received from this
school.”

rather than a traditionally-oriented
conformist.

I offer my criticism out of a faith
in this university. I believe that
Washington and Lee has a great,
unrealized potential and I criticize
not out of a desire to personally in-
sult anyone (I apologize if I have),
but out of a desire to see this uni-
versity get up and start moving. My
comments are purposely general,
for it is a basic problem we face:
the lack of courage to face the fu-
ture, forget the past if necessary and
do some creative thinking about
constructive change. For it is this
very willingness to change which
makes a school great. I leave you
with this thought: if Washington
and Lee is as good as many like to
say, why is it rarely discussed in
educational circles? And why, when
schools very similar to Washington
and Lee are receiving multi-million
dollar grants from the Ford Foun-
dation, are we shunned by this award
for excellence?

In addition to the 625 acceptance

Dean Lewis John, Director of Fi-

nancial Aid, has disclosed that a
total of seventy-three members of
the incoming freshman class will
participate in the University’s schol-
arship and grant-loan programs.
This year, he said, aid has been
awarded virtually in all cases of fi-
nancial need, and in the full amount
of that need.
Four students have been awarded
George F. Baker grants; eleven will
receive Robert E. Lee Scholarships.
Fifty-one entering freshmen have
been named to receive University
loan-and-grant combinations. Three
Rockbridge freshmen will receive
the customary reduction granted to
County students. Additionally, eight
outstanding aid applicants were
given Washington Awards, which are
a token grant of $100 for the fresh-
man year only to students who did
not adequately demonstrate need.
Two National Merit Scholars enter
W&L next year.

Dean John noted that there will
be about five fewer aid recipients in
next year’s freshman class, but he
estimated that the total amount of
money involved will be greater, since
the need per recipient has risen.

Included in scholarship awards this
year for the first time are the gov-
ernment’s Educational Opportunity

W&L’'s contribution is significantly
higher than the E.O.G.

Also for the first time, the Uni-

Editor To Speak On

G. K. Chesterton, Richard Hughes,
Francois Maurice, and Joseph Roth.

In recent years he has traveled
much in Europe and in Latin Amer-

symposia, and has lectured on con-
temporary Hungarian literature and

duly cut by students, perhaps he
should examine his own classroom
presentation. Is not the present sys-
tem similar to the system that Mr.
Rider described earlier this year in
which the professor was paid for
his quality? The means of payment
is different, but the effect on the
professor should be the same.

While it cannot be denied that
some students are completely un-
motivated and will never attend
classes under the present cut sys-
tem, for the most part, students will
attend classes if the professors make
the classes worthwhile. Therefore, I
ask Washington and Lee’s professors
to examine their own houses before
criticizing the students and the pres-
ent cut system.

Sincerely,
