 

“Derby Day” To Be Fancy Dress Theme

Bk ALAN COOPER

Fancy Dress President Joe
ennouneed today the selection of
“Derby Day” as the theme for the
1966 Fancy Dress Ball. The annual
dance weekend is scheduled for Jan-
uary 29-30.

According to Miller,
from Nashville, Tennessee, the theme
was chosen specifically to “escape”
from the Civil War motif into which
every Fancy Dress theme tends to
degenerate. Another reason was to
give more variety to the decorations
and costumes.

of costumes will be avail-
able before Christmas vacation,
which begins December 18. Exact
dates and times for costume fittings
have not yet been set, but will be
announced shortly.

Roy Taylor, Delt senior from Rich-

 

mond ,Virginia, has been appointed

Fancy Dress vice-president in charge

of costumes. A, complete list of
weekend vice-presidents will appear
in the Friday Ring-tum Phi.

Prices for costume rentals are ex-
pected to be down from last year,
with outfits starting at $6.25.

Sets and decorations for this year’s
ball, commented Miller, will be put
up and designed with professional
assistance. “We expect this to be a
substantial improvement over the
previous years,” said Miller, “and we
hope to set a lasting precedent.”
The Dance Board Advisory Coun-
cil, composed of two members from
each fraternity, will assist in the
constructions of sets and in the gen-
eral preparation for the Ball.

Miller noted that straight bourbon

Last Year’s Ball Crowded

Last year’s Fancy Dress Ball had
“Showboat” as a theme, and head-
lined the Glenn Miller Orchestra, Joe
and Eddie, and The Lettermen. At-
tendance at the Ball last year was,
according to the Dance Board, heav-
iest in several years. Over 200
couples crowded Evans Dining Hall
last year for the South’s last major

 

 

college dance.

Change In ‘Automatic Rule Governor Smylie To Speak
Voted At Faculty Meeting On Dec. 14 In Lee Chapel

Academic Probation Substituted
For Automatic Rule Penalty

Dean W. W. Pusey announced today sweeping changes

in the University’s automatic

rule approved by the faculty

yesterday, and effective January 1966. The new policy pro-
vides for academic probation instead of withdrawal from the
University for those students who fall under the automatic rule

January of each session.

Dean Pusey pointed out that the
new policy does not eliminate min-
imum grade-point ratios, but rath-
er that it insures students a “sec-
ond chance” in almost every case
Failure to make minimum progress
will result in academic probation or
action under the automatic rule

Probation

A student is placed on academic
probation for the following semester
if he fails earn a grade-point
ratio of at least equal to the follow-
ing:

1. During the first semester of his
freshman year a grade-point ratio
on all work attempted of 375.

2. During the second semester of
his freshman grade-point
ratio of all wark attempted of 4.

During each semester of his soph-
omore year a grade-point ratio on
all work attempted of 5

4. During each subsequent semes-
ter a grade-point ration on all work
attempted of .7

If a student is placed on academic
probation both he and his parents
will be warned of his precarious po-
sition, and he may required to
withdraw from the University at
any time that his academic work is
unsatisfactory. A student on academ-
ic probation is still not permitted to
own, control, or operate a motor ve-
hicle within Rockbridge County, or
to participate in certain athletic or
extra-curricular activities. Fresh-
and sophomores on academic
probation are eligible to participate
in intramural athletics

Still Automatic

rule and thus

NSA and W&L?

This evening the Executive Committee of the student body
will take under consideration a proposal to affiliate with the
United States National Student Association. The eighteen year
old confederation of university student governments is some-
what controversial particularly in the South because of its in-
volvement in national politics. The Association in the last few
years adopted a number of resolutions dealing with American
domestic and foreign policy which are representative of the

liberal point of view.

Unfortunately, the publicity which has surrounded the pub-
lication of these resolutions seems to indicate that the organ-
ization is speaking for all its member schools. This is, of course,
not true, and if the press had bothered to investigate they
would have discovered that there is significant dissent within
the organization over these issues.

All too many students who are opposed to joining this

group fail to realize that the

Association provides a forum

through which member schools can and do express minority
opinions. It is rather ridiculous to boycott the Association
simply because at this time it does not represent the views of
our school. Obviously, we cannot hope to change its position
by ignoring its existence or refusing to participate. We can
withdraw from the group later if it proves to be worthless.

On the other hand it is apparent that we do not at this
time know a sufficient amount about the operation of the As-
sociation or its possible value to Washington and Lee. Even
though the Executive Committee has received an extensive
brochure from the group, there is not any first hand infor-
mation concerning the relative merits of membership. With-
out this knowledge of the practical aspect of the Association,
we feel it extremely unwise to take action until all the facts are
known. As for the political involvement, it should be pointed
out that these controversial resolutions comprise only about
ten per cent of the business conducted by the Association.

We are certainly aware of the many benefits which could
accrue to Washington and Lee as a result of membership in
this organization, if, indeed, its services function as they are
described. Perhaps the Executive Committee should avail them-
selves of the opportunity to hear personally from a represen-
tative of the Association which it is most happy to provide.
In any even a careful and dispassionate appraisal of the propos-
al must be undertaken if the EC is to fulfill its responsibility to
the students of Washington and Lee.

 

University Forsakes Heritage
New Buildings Feeble Follies

By NICK RUFFIN

Not long ago architect Edward
Durell Stone said of the City of New
York, “If you look around you and
you give a damn, it makes you want
to commit suicide.” I think the same
could be said for the situation at
Washington and Lee.

Washington and Lee, unlike many
colleges, was not originally saddled
with a collection of architectural
monstrosities whose only worth was
the fond memories they provide for
the alumni. The Washington College
Group, Newcomb Hall, Tucker Hall
and Lee Chapel form one of the most
handsome college settings in the
country.

But to praise the original campus
is net my purpose today. The uni-
versity has forsaken its heritage by
scarring the campus with such feeble
follies as duPont Hall, the New Sci-
ence Building, the student union,
and the new dorms. Of the new
buildings, the Evans Dining Hall
alone has merit.

The more recent additions to the
W&L campus appear to be products
of the Jello School of Architecture.
Some imaginative person pours
bricks and white columns into a
mould, shakes well and waits for the
mixture to harden. For buildings of
different sizes, a larger or smaller
mold is used. The results are spec-
tacular. They would please anyone
who judges the quality of a building
by the redness of its bricks or the
whiteness of its columns. (Sometimes
the bricks are not red enough, so
they are painted purple.)

The new dorms have all the digni-
ty and charm of a self-service funer-
al home. The student union is large-
ly useless space; the bare tile floors,
bare walls and spare furnishings are
reminiscent of the guest quarters at
Andersonville. Only the U.C.A. room
provides attractive surroundings.
The New Science Building presents
us with a monolithic mass. It has
no symmetry; white pilasters are
randomly abandoned on its facade.
One expects the oppressive pile to
eore into the ravine. And finally
there is duPont Hall. How ironic
that it should house the Fine Arts
Department. I am surprised that
anvone in the arte can be convinced
to enter the building.

Some say the architecture, or lack
ai it, in a building is a reflection on
the men who built it. To look at
WAL’ « most recent offerings, I would

 

judge the men ultimately respon-
sible for them to be uninspired, pe-
dantic, and aesthetically impover-
ished. This is harsh critism to
level at the administration and the
Board of Trustees. Rather, I imagine
the problem is one of neglect and
not of conscious blundering.

It comes to mind at this point to
ask who is the university architect?
His name is never mentioned in an-
nouncements. 1 am sure he is more
than competent and if given free
reign, could do a creditable job.
Unfortunately the evidence we have
would bring him critical acclaim
second only to that received by
George Stewart, the Capitol Archi-
tect.

A number of other colleges often
choose architects of national repu-
tation, Saarinen, Yamaski, Pei,
Stone, Le Corbusier, Rudolph, John-
son, and Nervi for example. By
choosing an outstanding architect
the college may be rewarded with
both an outstanding building and
national recognition as a result of
the building.

To expect that each new building
will be a significant advance in arch-
itectural achievement is unrealistic.
The least that can be expected,
though, is that a building not be a
regression, and that it not detract
from its surrounding. To copy the
past is to maintain the the level
previously achieved. The problem
with the new buildings at Washing-
ton and Lee is not that they are
copies of the past, but that they are
poor copies. The balance, harmony
and proportion found in notable
Georgian and Greek Revival struc-
tures is missing in W&L’s new build-
ing. The fundamental principles that
are found in the original buildings
at Washington and Lee have been
denied

I think that a building should be
an expression of its time. A well
executed modern building would not
destroy the W&L campus. The use
of all available knowledge and ma-
terials in new campus buildings
seems especially appropriate at a
college which prizes intellectual hon-
ests

There will be a meeting of the
freshmen not affiliated with a frater-
nity Thursday, at 10 pm. in the
dorm lounge. Fred Mindel will

By WARD BRIGGS

Ed Side has brought two movies
to town this week, which may have
helped to settle or upset our dis-
tended Thanksgiving stomachs. The
first is Sweet Ecstacy, starring Elke
Sommer, the second, A Stranger
Knocks, with some grating Danes.
The first deals with an innocent
young man who falls in with a Mu-
tual Aberration Society, who at the
very end finds religion, and returns
to his wholesome actress (?) girl
friend. The second is about an es-
caping traitor who makes love to the
wife of a man he killed during the
war.

Both of these contained great
scenes of erotic pleasures (before
they got into the hands of the Mary-
land moralists, anyway) yet, there
is a difference between the two
which must be pointed out before
both are tossed in the same waste
basket.

The greatest criticism of censor-
ship in the movies is that the courts
and censor boards have concerned
themselves primarily with the mat-
ters of “borderline cases” in which
there has been considerable dispute
and great press agentry. while other
sheer “skin flics” have passed un-
noticed. Why should these movies be

Current Cinema

 

‘A Stranger Knocks’ Endorsed

so censored when we can all go up
to Roanoke or Richmond and see
much more, anytime?

The answer is that the Supreme
Court has made it the intention of
the law to leave the door of censor-
ship only “the slightest bit ajar,”
so as to protect the fundamental
freedoms of speech and press guar-
anteed by the Constitution. Only
those movies which have no other
“redeeming social value” shall be
censored. It then becomes the prob-
lem to find what exactly is obsceni-
ty and what is erotic realism.

As you may know, this matter is
usually relegated to a board of cen-
sors which decides whether a movie
is obscene or not, and whether or not
to show parts of the movie or all of
it.

Yet it seems that the distinction
has been made in the case of these
two movies. A Stranger Knocks re-
volves totally around a single scene
which crucially effects the action of
the script, which may have some
artistic justification. The “crucial”
scene of Sweet Eestacy only served
to show me what The hero really
came on board for and what I paid
the money for. It was, therefore, cut
from the movie.

 

The erotic realism of A Stranger

 

Knocks seems to reflect a bascially
healthy and therapeutic attitude to-
wards life. The denial of man’s basic
corporeality can only lead to dis-
tortions of the body image, which
have been shown to be responsible
for the mental states of depersonal-
ization and unreality which mark
more severe emotional disturbances
and give rise to movies like Sweet
Ecstacy or Promise Promise. On the
other hand, familiarity with one’s
body and a relaxed attitude to its
natural functions are prerequisites
of mental hygiene. Art which em-
phasizes these qualities is therefore
especially welcome at a time when
automation, push-button housekeep-
ing, mass production, and progres-
sive eradication of individual dif-
ferences make everybody’s search for
identity a matter of spiritual ur-
vival.

I am glad to see Stranger Knocks
go uncensored, and I unquestionably
endorse a realistic representation and
education of life (my chief objection
to Ecco) which does not stop short
of acknowledging and providing for
the individual’s physical and emo-
tional needs. This seems to me a
more realible prophylatic against de-
linquency crime and mental illness
than denial, suppression and author-
itarian rule.

 

Contemporary Author Tells All

 

By BRUCE W. RIDER

As I was loping about our fair
(not good, just fair) campus the
other day, I was
delighted to find
that one of Wash-
ington and Lee’s
many great liter-
ary products had
just been pro-
duced.

I borrowed sev-
enty-five cents
from a rich pro-
fessor and bought
my copy of our
enchanting stu-
den magazine, Malarial.

And, wonder of wonders, what
should I find but a kind and charm-
ing interview by the Malarial editor
with Goliath Smackem.

In case all the copies of Malar-
ial were sold out before you could
procure (get) one, we herewith
present parts of the interview for
your interest and edification.

Interviewer. “Do you have, Mr.
Smackem, any favorite authors be-
sides yourself?”

Smackem. “No.”

Int. “Not a one?”

Sm. “None.”

Int. “I see.”

Sm.“Um.”

Int. “Well, then, what do you
think of today's best-selling writ-
ers?”

Sm. “They're all terrible.”

The bearded

ones were there,
of course, but they
were in a minori-
ty. Making up
other segments of the crowd were a
large number of post-college adults,
many of whom had their children
with them, and the usual large num-
ber of middle-aged women that
such events generally attract. The
largest part of the group. however,
consisted of very normal high school
and college students. There were

Sm. “To be quite frank, young
man, I don't think anybody can

Sm. “Um.”

Int. “Would you comment on such
writers as Norman Mailman and

a mention from my precious lips.”

Int. “I don’t know just how to
ask you this, Mr. Smackem, but
isn't there anything you like?”

Sm. “Well, to tell the truth, it
never occurred to me to think of
things in those terms. Do I like any-
thing? Um. Well, yes, as a matter of
fact: I like me.”

Int. “What are the current trends
in American letters?”

Sm. “American literature is, to be
blunt, going to Hell in a wheelbar-
row.”

Int. “Is there any hope for this
country’s literature? I mean to say,
Mr. Smackem, are there any rays
of hope shining even dimly through
the black clouds of the contempor-
ary American literary scene?”

Sm. “You're beginning to sound
like me. What did you ask- Oh, yes.
Do I see any hope. Yes... yes I do.
Today, in the 20th Century America,
Goliath Smackem is writing. What
more does mankind need?”

Int. “You seem, if I may say so,
a little, well, proud of your work.”

Sm. “It’s really not my fault that
I'm the only good writer in the
United States (and parts of Europe,
Asia, and the Antarctic)”

Int. “I really do wish I had some-
thing more to ask you. I hope our
readers will like this interview when
it appears in Malarial.”

Sm. “Don't worry about a thing,
kid. I'll write up the interview for
you.”

Int. “You're very kind.”

Student Opposes NSA;

Cites Background, Policy
To Show Biased Opinion

To the Ring-tum Phi:

When the minutes of the Execu-
tive Committee meeting for No-
vember 30 were posted on the bullet-
in board, I was amazed to see that
the Committee was considering
membership in the National Student
Association. With the publication
of the article in Friday’s R-t P list-
ing the reasons given by President
Fred Mindel for membership. I was
no longer amazed, just angry.

What disturbs me and a good num-
ber of other students with whom I
have spoken is that Mindel did not
tell the whole story. He suggested
the advantages offered by the serv-
ices which NSA alledgedly provides.
But—he did not bother to tell the
TC, apparently, some facts which
probably should be considered.
Some of them follow.

A. The constitution of NSA pro-
hibits political activity, yet since
1961, NSA has consistantly partici-
pated in polities by:

1. urging the abolition of HUAC

2. urging unilateral disarmament

3. condemning United States in-

tervention in the Dominican Re-

publie

. urging the admission of Red

China to the UN

urging the immediate cessation

of bombing of North Viet Nam

and unconditional negotiation

. conducting an attack on the
American college fraternity sys-
tem.

B. NSA claims to represent the
students of the America and their
opinion, yet I would suggest this is
impossible for:

1. only 20% of the nation’s colleges
and universities are members
only 45% of these send delegates
to the national convention which
Mr. Mindel says makes state-
ments of interest to the student
on international issues.

. more than 30 major schools have
quit NSA since 1961. including
Indiana U., Ohio State,North-
western, and the University of
Texas.

4. Over a dozen schools have re-

fused to join NSA since 1961,
including Purdue, George Wash-

Washington, U.Va., American,

and most important, Washing-

ton and Lee. That's right, W&L

refused to join before so why

the sudden change?

C. Mindel listed a number of na-
tional leaders who have endorsed
NSA. I would suggest that those en-
dorsements were made prior to the
big change in NSA policy which oc-
curred in 1961, and I would ask Min-
del to update the references.

on

2.

D. As to the provision of serv-
ices to member schools mentioned
earlier, even that is not what it
seems. I would ask Mr. Mindel to
write to NSA for some of the infor-
mation he suggests is available, and
see how long it takes to get it, if he
gets it all. The major interest of
NSA is politics, not education.

The indictments run on and on.
I have only suggested a few. Yet
NSA would quite justifiably claim
that W&L supported the policies
mentioned above if we were to join.
WA&L would lend its honor and pres-
tige to an organization, which blat-
antly violates its own constitution,
and consistently distorts and lies
about student opinion which it
claims to represent. I would hope
that the EC will give a lot more
thought to the proposal te join NSA,
and I would further hope that those
students who find themselves op-
posed to membership in NSA will
take time to express that opinion,
especially to the BC.

Morrison Leads Generals
To First Win Of Season

Saturday night Washington and
Lee put an end to its losing ways,
defeating North Carolina Wesleyan,
86-89, on the loser’s court. Frank
Morrison came off the bench to score

21 points and lead five scorers into

double figures. W&L raced to a
41-29 lead at the half and then
played even ball with their op-

ponents during the second half as
they outscored Wesleyan, 45-50, to
notch the initial win of the season.

First Win in Four Starts
This win would be significant if
only for the fact that the Generals
broken into the win column
after three games. Last year it was
thirteen games before W&L could
show a victory for its efforts.

have

Canfield Optimistic
Coach Canfield is optimistic about
squad which consists of five
freshmen, two sophomores, three
juniors, and two seniors. His cause
for optimism comes from the early
performances of his young boys,
the balanced scoring of the team,
and the attitude of the players. Rob
Bauer, a freshman forward, and John
Carrere, a freshman guard have
turned in sparkling games thus far,
and both among six players
averaging in double figures.

Top Players
The two seniors on the team, cen-
ter Bob Spessard and forward Steve
Sweitzer, are also scoring in double

figures and in Coach Canfield’s
words “they have played up to ex-
pectation and I am very pleased

with them, especially Spessard who
is playing his best ball ever.” Jody
Kline, a sophomore and other start-
ing guard, and Morrison, an in-
valuable sixth man, are the other
two in double figure scorers.

Morale High

Team morale is high even though
the Generals lost to Bridgewater and
Old Dominion College, with both
opponents scoring over the hundred
mark. Canfield is quick to note that
the point difference was
large in the team’s two losses, the
boys have not quit, but instead have
played more determinedly when they
were behind. Canfield feels this is a

though

good sign

Season Appears Good

It is this balance scoring, high
morale, and fine play of the new boys
which Canfield feels constitutes a
better team than last year and one
which could end up with a .500 sea-
This would be a tremendous lift
for the basketball program at W&L,
but it entails hard work on the part
of each individual and the cohesive-
ness of the players as well as awell
rounded basketball team.

will be the Generals’ toughest game

ODK Changes
To February 22
As Tap Date

This past May, ODK presented to
the Executive Committee of the Fac-
ulty a request that in the future the
annual Tap Day Ceremony be held
on February 22 (or as close as pos-
sible thereto) instead of during the
first week in December.

The purpose of the suggested
change was two-fold. First, there
may be some students who would
qualify for membership in ODK in
every area except they fall just
short of being in the upper 35 per
cent of their class( this being the
academic requirement). The pro-
posed change would give them the
benefit of an additional semester
in which they might raise their
overall GPR.

Secondly, ODK inevitably begins
each academic year with an under-
graduate membership of only three
or four students. In an effort to en-
large this core, it is felt that here,
again, an additional semester would
enable it to give closer considera-
tion to the junior class, juniors hav-
ing had that much more time to dis-
tinguish themselves.

The date was suggested in the
spirit of providing an appropriate
and fitting tribute to our co-founder,
George Washington.

The Faculty Committee acted fav-
orably upon the request with the
change becoming effective this year.

Swimming Team

Drops 50-40

Match To Catholic University

Washington and Lee’s swimming
squad encountered its first setback
of the young season in a highly com-
petitive meet with Catholic Univer-
sity of Washington, D.C. The slight
50-45 margin of victory for the op-
position was determined in the last
event of the contest.

In an overall strong team effort
against the highly regarded squad
of Catholic U., W&L achieved four
first place finishes and displayed im-
pressive depth by gaining four sec-
ond places and eight third places.

The first event of the meet, the
medley relay was won by Pat Cos-
tello, Bill Ball, Bill Wildrick, and
Bart Taylor in 3:54.7, a new pool rec-
ord. Then Gary Bokinsky brought
home first place honors by accom-
plishing a 29.3 clocking in the 60
yard freestyle. This was followed by
Nelson Head’s triumph in the 200
yard backstrock, and Costello’s 2:29.8
victory in the 200 yard backstrock.

Before the final even of the meet
Washington and Lee was ahead, 45-
43. However, the 400 yard freestyle
proved to be the Generals downfall
in spite of a brilliant 3:33 effort.

This loss resulted in the 50-45 tally
favoring Catholic U.

According to Coach Norris East-
man, this meet represented a “tre-
mendous effort on the part of the
team in which all of our away team
records were broken.” Furthermore,
at this early stage, the squad’s times
are almost even with last year’s per-
formances at the end of the season.
Within the near future many school
and pool records should fall to the
improving hard working, spirited
1965 Washington and Lee swimming
team.

in a communique to the Mexican
government during the war for Texas

to rule people by military despotism

tion breeds revolution,

One had the feeling that Dugger
spoke for the conscience of a ma-
jority of Americans. This was en-
forced for he quoted Gallup polls
that showed that six out of seven
Americans would favor a UN-nego-
tiated peace in Viet Nam. Three out
of four people would vote for

a stronger effort for peace.

The remainder of Dugger’s speech

What Price Peace?

The various speakers had highly
divergent opinions on what was real-
ly wrong in the Vietnamese War.
Drugger belittled fear of China say-
ing that she is paranoid and should
be dealt with as a sick and weak

a

land war of massive destruction. One
asserted that a direct confrontation
with China could only result in an-
nihilation of the world.

The irreconsilable view points sug-
gests that the arguments are sec-
ondary, in fact, only rationalities of
the basic drive of thought that war,
all war, is evil and it must be end-
ed forever before we are to
completely above the rest of the ani-
mal world. The possibility of nuclear
proliferation makes this mandatory.

Don’t all truly human people be-

Mr. Dugger suggested.

Yes, we violated the 1954 Geneva
Conference agreement. Yes, we've
imposed an undemocratic govern-

civilians, our soldiers have destroyed
peasants’ possessions and shot inno-

Communist are truly interested in
peace, in peace for all time. It
doesn’t figure in their plans. Quite
the contrary is the evidence of the
last twenty years. They don’t want
, peace in Viet Nam; they just want
the US. out.

In all this is the everlying tragedy
of our time. We, who truly want
peace and the betterment of the
world, are not free to act our will,
but are being pulled helplessly down
the road of ever mounting massive
|armament by the Communist’s re-
build-up, that must
