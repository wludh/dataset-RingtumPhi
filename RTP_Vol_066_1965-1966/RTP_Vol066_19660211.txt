EC Outlines Semester Plans
With Seven-Point Program

A seven-point program of general
objectives for the coming semester
was adopted by the WC in its meeting
Tuesday night.

President Fred Mindel, in propos-
ing the program, suggested that the
EC could perform more in the field
of legislation than it had done in the
previous semester.

The EC plans to discuss and act
upon the following topics:

1. National Student Association. As
agreed on in December, the question
of membership in the controversial
National Student Association will be
placed before the student body in a
referendum, proceeded by an open
debate in the ODK forum.

On Next Monday, Feb. 14, the 14-
member member ODK council will
meet to consider the EC’s request
to convene the ODK forum which
consists of all members of the uni-
versity interested in the topic un-
der discussion. If the council agrees
that a forum is necessary, a date
will be set for it to meet, probably
Monday, Feb. 14, since at least one
week must elapse between the meet-
ing of the council and of the forum.

The forum debates on the desir-
ability of joining NSA will be key-
noted by speakers brought in by
supporters of NSA and by the con-
servative Young Americans for Free-

Experts Unmask
Skullduggery
In Skull Find

A gigantic fraud was uncovered
yesterday when it was revealed to
the Friday Ring-tum Phi that the
shattered skull discovered Sunday
by two freshmen on the site of ex-
cavations behind the Old Co-op had
actually been planted there by per-
sons unknown.

The finding of the skull had caused
a great stir among area histor-
ians. The report of the find, pub-
lished in this week's Tuesday edition,
contained an interview with Dr. Ad-
dison G. Brokebough, a Rockbridge
County resident and professor emer-
itus of paleontology at the University
of Virginia.

Dr. Brokebough had identified the
skull to a reporter as belonging to
an elderly Negro woman, possibly
identified with one Margaret Gar-
ret, a kitchen slave murdered in 1824
and buried in a graveyard whose lo-
cation was later lost.

He suggested that the construc-
tion workers digging the foundations
for a new wing of the co-op had

ization,

The discussion will be the first un-
dertaken by the ODK Leadership
Forum since its general reorganiza-
tion last fall.

2. A More Ordered Election Sys-
tem. Recognizing that the collapse
of the party system is likely to cause
chaos in spring elections, the BC will
look into the possibility of reform-
ing election procedure along the lines
already followed with success during
freshman elections, including pri-
maries and runoffs between the top
candidates for each office.

The EC may also seek to change
the student government to allow EC
and class officer elections to be held
at different times, so that candidates
defeated in an EC election might run
for a class office.

3. Saturday Classes. Investigations
into the question of a five-day week
will be continued, perhaps with a
new student opinion poll; the EC
feels that the poll held last fall was
inconclusive and could have been
better presented.

4, Grading System. In response to
many complaints, both from students
and faculty, concerning a grading
system which allows a student with
a 70 to receive the same grade as a
student with a 79, while a student
with an 80 gets a higher one the BC
will investigate alternative systems.

5. Less Rigid Exam Schedule. In
order to prevent the barrage of five
exams in three days which is possible
under the examination schedule now
in effect, the EC will study the meth-
ods followed by other schools, in
which students are more or less al-
lowed to choose their own time to
take an exam within a certain time
period, or otherwise protected from
an unfair exam load.

6. Curriculum Committee. The EC
will consider the formation of a stu-
dent committee to evaluate courses,
such as is already in effect at schools
such as Yale, Hollins, and Sweet
Briar.

7. Girls in Dorms. The BC will seek
to abolish or modify the rule against
girls in the dormitories.

Each of the six last points of the
program will be looked into by an
EC committee. The committees will
present a preliminary progress report
to the EC on Feb. 22, and a final re-
port on March 1.

Library Self. Study Discusses
Budget, Physical Plant, Staff

At the student gathering for the
Library Self-Study, the problems of
physical plant, the budget, the staff
and the technical equipment of the
library were discussed.

Presided over by Dr. Allen Moger,
chairman of the Faculty Library
Committe, stated that the most ur-
gent need of the library was to pro-
cure more space. Only by the pro-
curation of additional space can the
library consider making increases in
the number of volumes in the li-
brary.

Behind this need for greater space
lies the problem of money. In order
to improve the library, the finances
available to the library have to be
increased. In less than twelve months
the library has received donations
amounting to $11,000. Also, the li-
brary is increasing its annual budget
from $6,000 to $48,000 over a ten year
period.

Two places are available for the
library to expand. Without great
physical work in the stacks of the
main library, the sixth level of the
building can be renovated to hold
old books which the fifth level now
holds. This will free space for 40,000
additional volumes on the fifth floor
The department now also has total
access to the basement. If a place can
be found to hold the ROTC Depart-
ment, the basement of the library
will be available for study rooms

The chief objective of the library
in purchasing books and periodicals
is to cover areas of student instruc-
tion. Presently the library purchases
books at the rate of 5,000 a year. Ol
these 5,000 books approximately 80
per cent are specified by members
of the departments

The self-study urged all faculty
members to submit a list of books
they needed. In addition to this

there is the possibility of each stu-
dent submitting suggestions to his
department head about books the
library needs.

Each department is allotted a set
sum of money for the purchase of
new books. Any money not used
specifically by the departments is
used for the purchase of boks and
periodicals of general value.

In the discussion of the physical
plant, the problem of noise in the
library was discussed. The students
generally agreed that the library
serves as a focal point for sudent
gatherings. The students also com-
plained about the poor chairs in the
library and the need for separating
the reading room from the general
study room on the main level of the
library.

The committee agreed to look into
the purchase of some comfortable
chairs for the library. Also, in de-
fense of the noise in the library, Mr.

Harrington Analyzes
Problem of Poverty

Michael Harrington, self-described
worker, author, and a forceful,

“radical,” civil-rights
entertaining public speaker,

probed the extraordinary extent of the problem of poverty,
especially in urban areas, last night in the opening address of

CONTACT 1966's investigatio

n of “The City.”

Poverty is one of the fundamental issues in our society

today, Harrington noted, and

under interest created in the

Kennedy and Johnson administrations and through the “Great

Society” program, the problem

“live debate rather than a rhetorical®
question.”

The standard governmental defini-
tion of poverty is misleading, the ob-
served; it assumes that any family of
any size in any geographic area is
poor if its income is $3,000 annually
or less. Practically, however, such a
comprehensive figure is almost
meaningless. In our present economic
structure, “poverty equals” for a
family of four $3,133 in urban cen-
ters, and $2,190 in farm regions.

the problem, are most helpful in
comphehending its immensity, Har-
rington continued. Perhaps most
striking is the fact that those fam-
ilies with the maximum “poverty-
level” incomes, the “best-off of the
poor,” can spend a total of ninety
cents at their major meal of each
day. These people do not live in
another world, Harrington stated,
but are Americans—and yet they do
not regularly eat meat or eggs.

The “most spectacular example of
the poor today,” Harrington ob-
served, “are the non-whites.” Seven-
ty-five per cent of the poor are
white—but only ten per cent of
the country’s total population is
non-white. The twenty-five per cent
of America’s poor which is non-
white represents forty-eight per cent
of the non-white population. These
people who are living at the
level of the Depression, Harrington
commented. Furthermore, nearly half
of the total poor are under eighteen
years of age; poverty affects one-
fifth of the total population, but one-
quarter of the population under
eighteen

Poverty problems are not nearly
solved with welfare money, he said.

than is obvious: Harrington quoted

Rush Books—Are They Worth It?

In recent years Washington and Lee fraternities have be-
come involved in an ever-increasing price war in order to
pledge the University’s top freshmen. Not many will deny that
the fraternities seem to be winning the war (each year nearly
80 per cent of the freshman class is pledged), but the price
they’re paying to accomplish this goal is becoming fantastic.

Total expenses for the fall’s most hectic week are now esti-
mated in excess of $25,000. That’s better than $40.00 per
“greek” upperclassman. It is our considered opinion that Rush
Week expenses are far out-of-line in relation to the amount
necessary to execute an efficient program.

This week the Interfraternity Council considered a pro-
posal which would abolish individual fraternity publications
and instead issue a single enlarged version of the IFC rush
brochure. Although the proposal was met with considerable
controversy, we feel the individual fraternities should seriously
consider such a change. It is true that the present program
offers each house an opportunity to deliver a more complete
summer rush message. We wonder, however, if this message
is worth the $12,000 it is now costing?

When every fraternity becomes involved in outdoing their
neighbors, which is what has been happening, the result be-
comes a literary stand-off at higher and higher printing costs.
The IFC proposal would allow each house an equal opportuni-
ty to present its sales message in a single edition that cost from
$7-9,000 less than the present system. Such a publication could
be handled by the University’s print shop, eliminating many of
the summer headaches faced by rush chairmen in meeting

commercial printer’s deadlines.

Aside from the cost factor there is great debate on whether
entering freshmen are not receiving too much rush material
now causing many booklets to find a home in a trash can.
Many we feel would prefer a 50-100 page booklet which of-
fers them all the information necessary about W&L frats under
one cover. This in itself would eliminate much of the duplica-
tion of information our present system encourages.

The proposal would not eliminate individual summer cor-
respondence or personal contact; the measure is designed solely
to reduce the excessive cost factor involved in printed literature.

It seems clear to us that such a step is needed and this
rational and, we believe, fair solution is the best means of
trimming fraternity rush budgets.

 

Awad Urges Delayed Rush

By JIM AWAD

Without a doubt, fraternities are
one of the most important influ-
ences on the student at Washington
and Lee. As a matter of fact, if one
were to eliminate fraternities from
the campus scene, our university
would little resemble the W&L we
are used to. It seems to me that in
the light of such importance and
such total integration into the social
and academic aspects of student life
that the subject of fraternities ought
to be handled with extreme care.

After “thoughtful consideration,”
I have come to the conclusion that
we are guilty of not exercising such
care by leaving rush week at the be-
ginning of the school year, and in
light of this I advocate the defer-
ment of rush week until the first
week of second semester.

First of all, fraternities, under
pressure to get a good pledge class,
often make mistakes in handing out
their bids. The inevitable result is
an internal fight as to whether to
ball the boy in question or not, and
usually the boy in fact is dismissed

Consequently, the house has been
weakened by internal strife, and one
poor freshman is left in a very dif-
ficult position. A second-semester
rush would undoubtedly give the
fraternities an entire semester to
compile a list of “desirables” and
“undesirables.”

Secondly, the freshman himself
often aceepts the wrong bid. Usually,
he will wait it out for a while just to
make sure, and by the time he does
depledge, it is usually too late for
him to join another house in time
to initiated with their pledge
class, and consequently being that
he must remain a super-pledge for

freshmen go through much pledging

them. Given the first semester to
analyze the situation, they would be
much better able to reach a rational
decision. This in turn, would elimi-
nate the pledging and initiation of
men who really aren't fraternity ma-
terial.

Critics of second semester rush
would point to the lack of social life
that would be available to the first
semester freshman. The only answer
that can be made to this charge is
that it assumes a static situation. The
mixers down the road afford fresh-
men the opportunity to meet girls;
and if the IFC and the administra-
tion participated in sponsoring
dances to relieve the situation and
in urging the fraternities to leave
their parties open, then the state of
affairs would not be that bad.

The weight of the evidence, then,
would seem to be in favor of second-

semester rush.

voyage of the research vessel

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

In last week’s discussion of the
Tahitian civilization, I ommitted the
most pertinent aspect of it—the
Tahitian attitude toward sexual mor-
ality. I did so because the Tahitian
concept of sex is radically different
from ours, and the subject needs
thorough treatment.

Tahitians are uninhibited by the
legalistic and often senseless morality
_ that we westerners
have concocted for
ourselves. Their
approach to sex is
that it is a delight-
ful fact of life, and
they indulge in it

shamelessly and
joyously.
Marriage is a

rather vague con-
cept for Tahitians,
and notions of
preserving one’s
chastity for a hypothetical mate are
extremely rare—if they exist at all.
Since everyone has “premarital”
sexual relations without any sense of
guilt or embarrassment, sex is fully
enjoyed without the psychological
anxiety inevitable to such relations
in our society.

A Typical Affair

In Papeete, I met a Tahitian girl
who insisted on discussing her affair
with an American sailor. With con-
siderable pride, she described their
sexual relationship and introduced
me to their “illegitimate” child. Then
she pressed his love letters on me,
urging that I read them all. After
I had done this—with some embar-
rassment—she composed a love letter
to him in French, which she per-
suaded me to translate into good
English. She then copied my trans-
lation in her own hand and sent the
letter to her sailor.

This girl is in no way untypical
of Tahitians, and despite my western
upbringing, I was unable to think of
her as “brazen” or “promiscuous” or
to apply to her any of the prudish,
rancorous adjectives that Americans
have stowed away for such situa-
tions.

Montgomery

Erotic Dances

A tremendous proportion of the
Tahitian culture is designed to stim-
ulate and beautify sex. Dancing, for
instance, is extremely erotic. It is
characterized by a frenzied music,
produced by a rhythmic, staccato
beat on bamboo and log percussion
instruments, matched by an equally
frenzied dance by women and men.
In the dance, a rapid shaking of the
hips is matched by a slower, grace-
ful movement of the torso, arms, and
hands. Grass skirts, worn by both
sexes, accentuate the movement of
the hips and produce a shimmering
effect. The dancers are naked to the
waist, but wear necklaces (heis) and
crowns of flowers and shells. The
entire effect is one of exciting, sen-
sual beauty.

These dances, sometimes accom-
panied by harmonious songs and
chants, may illustrate Polynesian
mythology or describe natural

 

aly Wr

  
 

events, but they have the basic, de-

 

 

 

 

 

liberate purpose of arousing desire
in the dancers.

Quatorze Juillet

Tahiti is the social center of the
Society Island Archipelago, and

young men and women frequently
migrate there, if only temporarily,
to participate in the native festivals
and to have greater sexual opportun-
ities. On the 14th of July (Bastille

 

Day) particularly, there is a great

 

A Young Tahitian Couple...

... free from

gathering of the islanders to indulge
themselves in days of dancing, cele-
bration, and lovemaking. The Ta-
hitians eagerly anticipate the annual
Bastille day, though not for the same
reasons as the French.

Obviously, the Tahitian attitude
toward sex produces many babies
“born out of wedlock,” an occurance
which distresses western moralists.

The word “illegitimate” has no mean-
ing for the Tahitians, however, and
babies are far from a problem in
the islands. Polynesians have an in-
nate love of children and consider
them community property; they are
even given away to childless people.
In fact women are expected to have
children before settling down with
one man, in order to prove their
fertility.

Thus, the Polynesian sense of sex-

 

the restrictions of Western morality.

ual morality is strikingly different
from ours. While western prudery
has occasionally labeled Polynesian
sex relations as orgiastic, they are in
reality far more innocent than our
own. Tahitians do not connect sin
with sex; they go into sexual rela-
tions entirely without feelings of
guilt. The same cannot be said for us,
who regard sex as the antithesis of

innocence and who are inescapably
burdened with guilty consciences in
our relations.

The Dying Civilization

In this article, and in last week’s,
I have described the ideal side of
modern Tahitian life. That view
taken by itself is deceptive, for the
modern Tahitian is beset by serious
threats to his native existence.

The Tahitians have so far been
able to preserve much of their
civilization intact, especially on the
out-islands. They are being rapid-
ly westernized, however, and their
way of life is doomed to eventual
extinction,

Almost half of the population of
Tahiti is Chinese—people originally
brought in as laborers when the
French found that Tahitians would
not “work.” The Chinese have cher-
ished and maintained their own cul-
ture, and are procreating much more
rapidly than the Tahitians. Soon,
they will be given full property and
voting rights, and the un-competi-
tive Polynesian civilization will be
swamped under a wave of Chinese
commercialism.

“Western Virtues”

The French, too, are busily trying
to inflict the virtues of western
progress on the Tahitians. This
progress inevludes roads, automo-
biles, tourism, radio and _ T.V,,
French language schools, and an
atomic testing installation—all of
which the Tahitians detest.

The Tahitians appreciate their cul-
ture and well realize that it is fa-
tally threatened, but they are almost
powerless to fight back. To cope with
the Chinese and French, they would
have to become just as competitive
and modern, and then they would
have lost their civilization anyway.
Armed rebellion would be insane
on such a small island, though sev-
eral Tahitians talked to me of revo-
lution.

Hatred for the French and Chin-
ese is intense. A Tahitian friend of
college age once told me that he
would begin killing the French right
now, if only he had a gun. Never-
theless, it should be said for the
French that they have destroyed
their Polynesian colonies much less
rapidly that the United States, Japan,
Chile, Germany, or Britain.

Despite the impending end of
Polynesian society, Tahiti remains
today an earthly paradise, both in
the nature of its people and in its
physical beauty. I feel that of the
many places I have recently seen,
that Tahiti is unsurpassed in both
qualities.

munist riot—Tokyo, Japan.)

I feel it necessary that I apologize

 

 

for one mistake I made.

I mentioned the fact that some
professors were not following the
new cut system put into effect by
the administration. Since the article
appeared, I have been told that it
was not the administration which
initiated the new cut system, but the
faculty members themselves.

Since the Tuesday editor allowed
the article to go into the paper
without calling my attention to the
error I apologize for my making the
mistake. I do not, however, feel that
my position should be changed

I did not say that the individual
faculty members did not have the
right to check attendance in thei:
classes; I merely stated that either
the rule should be changed to read
that each professor should determine
attendance in his classes, or each
professor should abide by the un-
limited cut rule which they them-
selves made.

Though I told that
there some “sour grapes” in
the new ruling, I do not feel that this
is sufficient reason for professors to
renounce it, which, in effect, they are
doing when they make a student suf-
fer beeause he has used the privilege
of unlimited cuts, If there are mem-
bers of the faculty who are definitely
against the unlimited cut rule, then
the rule should perhaps read “
each professor shall determine clas

have been

were

attendance.” Something definite
however, should be said

A student should not have to rely
on the advice of someone who had
a professor the year before and
thinks that he gives student an au-

omatic “C” if he cute more than

 

a week of classes. If this ia the way
that a professor feels, then he should
tell his students that. This, however
is taboo, for we are suppo ed to have
unlimited cuts

0 '

The whole prothem i viciou
cirele though some professors

 

make students suffer for what they
term “excessive cutting,” there is no
official way that they can warn a
student. They can call a student
down for it, but he does not know
what point must be passed before his
grade begins to suffer.

What I believe should be done is
either have the rule changed to read
that each professor will determine
Class attendance, or have the faculty
abide by the unlimited cut rule
which they themselves made. We
would like to know just where we
stand.

Improving Cagers Defeat RPI, 72-71

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Washington and Lee basketball is
fast giving Coach Verne Canfield
ulcers, but he doesn’t really mind—
not now that the Generals are win-
ning. It happened again Tuesday
night in Richmond as it was W&L
72, R.P.1. 71.

The Generals started slowly, miss-
ing their first seven shots and fall-
ing behind, 6-0, before freshman
John Carrere pulled ofl a three-point
play with an assist from running-
mate Jody Kline.

W&L later pulled within three
again at 18-15 on a Bauer fast-break
following a blocked R.P.I. shot by
Steve Sweitzer.

When Carrere hit a ten-foot jump-
er on another fast-break with 6:56
remaining in the half, W&L pulled
ahead for the first and only time of
the half, 26-25. At the midway point
it was RPI by six, 39-33, as the Gen-
erals could hit only 31 per cent in
the first twenty minutes.

The second half started the same
way, but W&L finally edged ahead
for good at 46-45 as junior forward
Frank Morrison hit a three-foot fol-
low shot.

Then the Generals’ Rob Bauer be-
gan to hit, scoring 13 of W&L’s re-

All year long the Ring-tum Phi has
featured a columnist with the abili-
ty of Sports Hlustrated, and it has
happened again. The Washington
and Lee varsity wrestling team, sub-
ject of last week's lead story, was
defeated in both of its North Caro-
lina matches this week.

The Generals fell to Duke Tues-
day 17-16 and to N. C. State the
next day, 20-8. The Generals started

well against the Blue Devils and
were leading 16-8 when the roof
fell in.

Jim Bruton, at 130, pinned his man
in 7:34, and was followed by Kem
White's quick pin of 1:35 to make the

score 10-5

Don Patterson then decisioned his
man 3-1, after which Charlie
Slaughter lost in a high scoring

match. Jamie Andrew put W&L back

maining 26 points. But Lyn Creech,
the game’s high scorer with 31 points,
kept the Rams in the game, scoring
18 of his points in the closing 12
minutes.

The Generals’ lead fluctuated for
the next few minutes as W&L tried
to build a lead. But R.P.L, down
72-67, rallied and got the ball with
47 seconds left, trailing by only one.

After a short stall, Co-Captain C.
G. Winston rimmed a long jumper
with 15 seconds left. Jody Kline re-
bounded for W&L and was fouled
with 11 seconds to go. Kline, whose
two free throws in the closing sec-
onds, defeated R.P.I. in Lexington,
then missed the first of the one-and-
one.

Creech rebounded and called time-
out with only 8 seconds remaining.
When the ball was put back in play,
Winston’s pass was deflected by

 

For those who don’t know, it almost
always happens this way when W&L
breaks out the helmets and pads in
the off season and attempts to get
an early start at the real thing sche-
duled several months in the future.

to clear the area, but our boys al-
ways have managed to do it them-
selves with some good hard running.”
and McLaughlin. “We've never been
kept off the field yet.”

Once the Generals get their first
job done, McLaughlin will send an
expected 60 candidates through fun-
#damentals and scrimmages, the latter
scheduled for each day until an
alumni-varsity game will conclude
the two-week-long program Feb. 26.

recovered for the Rams and called
time at the 2 second mark.

As the buzzer sounded Winston's
25-foot jump shot from the corner

the game was over.

The Washington and Lee freshman
basketball team has evened its sea-
son ledger at 4-4 with two wins
since the beginning of the second
semester.

The first day of action saw the
freshmen, led by Ken Long’s 16
points and 18 rebounds, defeat Vir-
ginia Episcopal School 62-58. Fol-
lowing Long in the scoring were
Greg Crampton with 12 and Lloyd
Cunningham with 10.

The second win of the week was
over Fishburne Military Academy,
91-56, as Greg Crampton was the
star with 21 points and 25 rebounds.
Long chipped in with 18 points,
Cunningham with 12, and Larry
Boetsch with 10. Crampton was help-
ed on the boards by Richard Lohr-

In scoring their seventh win of the
season W&L hit 38 per cent and
placed four players in double fig-
ures—Bauer with 22, Morrison and
Carrere with 14, and Spessard with
10. The Generals also won the bat-
tle of the boards, 52-38, as Spessard
pulled down 12 and Morrison grab-
bed 11.

Coach Canfield has said that the
recent success of the Generals, win-
ners of five of their last eight games,
has done wonders for the team. For
the first time in years, a W&L team
has not only desire, but also pride
and confidence in itself.

Dear Mom and Dad,

The lucky readers of this famous,
or infamous, column just don’t know
how lucky they are. Right now it is
3:00 on Thursday afternoon, and
every single person in the plush of-
fices of the Ring-tum Phi has in-
formed me they do not wish to write
my column for me this week. There-
fore, I have no choice but to do the
deed myself.

At least I have a hot tip for every-
one. Clifton Forge High School will
be playing over at VMI this Tues-
day night. The reason that I call
this to your attention is a rather big
one, all 69” of him. He is Walker
Banks, who could become another
Westley Unseld

Wednesday night Clifton Forge, a
group II classification team, played
away at Covington who is leading the
I-B Blue Ridge District, and beat
them 89-50

Banks, with three personals in the
first quarter and a half still scored
27 points, pulled in 31 rebounds, and
blocked 8 shots

In the only game of the season
when Banks didn't get into foul
trouble and was allowed to play the
whole game, he scored 63 points
That's bad, and with a little
practice he could even become a

not

score!

Now to answer the question, “Just
who is Westley Unseld?” Ask any-
one from Louisville. Better still, just
ask anyone who follows the Missouri

LOCATED AT SHOPPING CENTER

“It’s almost impossible to hold
our practices any later,” said Mc-
Laughlin, “since many of our players
would be engaged in the regular
spring sports.”

The Generals, who could manage
only a 3-6 record last fall with 22
lettermen on the line and nine more
in the backfield, this year will count
two more letter winners in the back-
field, but 11 less up front. Both
tackle and guard positions, and left
end have just one letterman, while
center and right end are better for-
tified with three monogram winners.

“This definitely will be a building
year,’ said McLaughlin. “We have
lost 22 players to graduation, in-
cluding fullback John Anthony, ends
Tersh Baker and Bob Barclay, line-
backer Joe Miller, tackles Starke
Sydnor and Jack Kelly, and backs
Larry Craig and Billy Andrews.
Each one was honored with some
kind of all-star recognition this past
year.”

 

Snow Won't Stop Coach Mac;
Spring? Drills Begin On Time

If McLaughlin is to find help, he’ll
have to turn to, perhaps, the largest
aggregation of freshmen ever to turn
out for spring drills. In all, 32 first-
year players have indicated a desire
to report, and that’s almost every-
one that played for the Brigaders
(4-2 record) last fall.

“We have at least two freshmen at
every line position, and 14 in the
backfield,” said McLaughlin. “If they
come along like we think they will,
it would be very possible that we
could have a fine season next fall.

On the basis of the unexpected
turnout, the Generals should have
one of their more talented backfields
in recent years. Three lettermen
quarterbacks—Andy Bloom, Bryant
Kendrick, and Jim Oram—will be
helped by eight left halfbacks, six
fullbacks, and seven right halfbacks.

Lettermen Rudd Smith and Buddy
Atkins are the top contenders for
the starting left half spot, with Smith

Library Funds
Discussed By
Self-Study

(Continued from page 1)
Henry Coleman, head librarian,
stated that the library has poor
accustics and that this problem does
not take precedence over the needs
of the library presented above.

If money is raised, the library
building itself may be extended
back towards the Old Dormitory.
This extension in the physical plant
will provide more room for indivi-
dual study carrells and also more
room for stacks.

The question of staff tenureship,
faculty standing for library assist-
ants and the hours of the library
were discussed briefly. The library
committee supported staff tenure-
ship on the grounds that it helped
attract and keep competent librar-
ians, since along with such status
there are fringe benefits. Also after
heated debate by the students, the
library is seriously considering leav-
ing the library open on Saturday
nights. There is one difficulty in this
plan, however. The library needs a
larger staff to handle the increased
hours and also the student helpers
in the library have to have greater
incentive to attend to their job on
time.

The meeting closed with the dis-
cussion of Xerox coin-operated
copying machines. The libray had
discarded the idea on the grounds
that the machine was unreliable.
Several students, however, verified
the dependability of the machines.
The library committee has promised
to look into the possibility of pur-
chasing one .

are proud of the reputation of our
paper, which has always been based
on our respect for the truth,” said
news editor Steve Saunders, who
had interviewed Dr. Brokebough,
“and this affair has cut us deeply.”

Dr. Brokebough himself was inter-
viewed by a reporter yesterday
afternoon on his reaction to the un-
covering of the hoax.

“I was grossly misquoted!” stated
Dr. Brokebough. “I find it incredible
that your reporter could have so
radically misinterpreted — I might
even say, embroidered upon—what
I said.”

Dr. Brokebough continued: “Of
course I spotted the incription right
away, and immediately suspected the
truth. But while I was examining it
l might have made a few chance
remarks, not to be taken seriously —
you understand, something like ‘This
reminds me of the skull of a mur-
dered woman I once saw in Ruanda-
Urundi.’ Yes! that’s it! Just a chance
remark, you know. Did you write
that down? As for a whole grave-
yard...1 was thinking how interest-
ing it would be, you know, if it
were all true. So I might have made
one or two humorous conjectures.
Certainly not what I was quoted as
saying. No, Sir!”

Dr. Brokebough, who revealed that
his health has been shattered by the
affair, leaves this evening for an ex-
tended vacation in South America.

sought jobs and been unable to find
them that they have stopped look-
ing; they do not consider “under-
employment” and “miserable jobs”
held by young people. Taken abso-
lutely, our present unemployment
rate would be scandalous in Europe,
where German manufacturers are
importing workers from other na-
tions to fill out the labor force.

Our economy is expanding at such
a rate that within twenty years, it
will double to a level of 1.5 trillion
dollars. But such economic growth
benefits those who are not poor
most—the recent tax cut, for ex-
ample, decreased the payments of
the largest taxpayers far more than
those of the poor.

Proposals which appear to be en-
tirely workable and practical are
numerous, Mr. Harrington continued.
A Commission on Automation, com-
posed of leaders from business, la-
bor, government, and the academ-
ic worlds has recommended a guar-
anteed income at a fundamental
level to every citizen. We must
strive, Harrington stated, to create
“a society in which everybody eats.’
Americans have a right to such in-
come, he observed, to do with what
they want.

Urban renewal is of prime con-
cern in alleviating the problems of
urban poverty. Cities must be vir-
tually re-built, but, unfortunately,
Mr. Harrington observed, President
Johnson's proposal is more spectac-
ular than his appropriation for ac-
tion: this year, $5 million have been
allotted to redevelopment—which

funds are part of a Ford grant.
The National Planning Commission
has said that cities need 2.1 trillion
dollars over the next twenty years.

Automation, Harrington continued,
is a problem only when a useful
occupation is not substituted. We
must try to eliminate “stooped and
degrading” labor; there are jobs to
replace these which do not require
college degrees. The Democratic
Study Group of 180 liberal Repre-
sensative to Congress endorses this
plan strongly, he said.

In his conclusion, Harrington noted
that in our society, the unit of dis-
cussion in relation to the future must
be not the wage-hour relationships,
but rather lifetimes. Society appears
to be terrified of its own affluence.
We must consider new kinds of
work, new lifetimes, as we approach
the Aristotelean ideal of a society
in which slavery can be abolished as
“inanimate objects of their own
movements make things.”

ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

CALLING ON THE BOARD! In order to set our 1966 campus

fashion reports in the proper perspective, we called upon members
of Esquire’s 1965 College Advisory Board to bring us up to date
on what’s being worn on campuses North, East, South and West
this winter. What regional fashion shifts occur as you move about
the country? How does the casual attire worn in the West, for
example, differ from that worn in the East? And which fashion
trends seem most likely to spread out to other areas of the country?
For some authoritative answers, read on...

THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH, according to
Michael Mains, University of Arizona ’65,
there’s a brisk traffic in lightweight conserva-
tive suits with the dash of color supplied largely
in neckwear, Striped ties predominate, but
foulards are moving in again. Everybody wears
button-downs, and the three-piece suit is in-
frequently seen on campus. In the mornings,
when there’s apt to be a chill in the air, a
sweater worn with a button-down sport shirt
and wheat jeans is sufficiently warm and in-
formal enough for class. Heather-toned sweaters
hold the edge, and corduroy jeans or wash-and-
wear khakis complete the casual scene. In feot-
wear, a wing tip properly complements a suit,
while saddle shoes or loafers are a standard part
of the informal picture.

SWINGING NORTH, Richard Gentry, Jr., University of Michigan,

tells us that for north-country winters the rugged toggle coats are
serviceable and popular. Above the knee lengths are what every-
one’s wearing. Here, the accent falls heavily on the informal touch:
V-neck sweaters in solid colors; button-downs, both plain and
striped; tapered corduroys and wheat jeans; and a solid serving
of loafers and chukka boots. For fraternity parties and other social
events, plaid sport jackets are beginning to make the scene. Her-
ringbone and heather sport jackets lead the field, but big patterns
are beginning to make some headway. In neckwear, there's a trio
of popular entries: stripes, club figures and paisleys. Semiformal
slacks are usually tapered flannel, and loafers or wing-tip shoes go
best with the sport jacket and slacks.

 

WAY OUT WEST, at Berkeley, Scott Gregg in-

forms us that one of the unique features on
his campus is the colored sneaker. Perhaps this
is a manifestation of Berkeley's celebrated pen-
chant for innovation. Beyond that, the fashion
picture, both in casual and dressy attire, follows
patterns familiar throughout the rest of the
country’s campuses, V-neck sweaters predomi-
nate, with crew necks a close second. Sport
shirts appear in a wide, but not necessarily wild,
variety of patterns and colors. Madras is the
outer limit. Permanent press casual slacks and
blue jeans are In in the casual order of things.
Herringbone, hound's-tooth, and heather mix-
tures complete the sport jacket picture, with
greens and grays the most popular colors in the
tapered slacks which are worn with the jacket.
Colored or pin stripe button-downs and diagonal-striped ties (plus

 

loafers) round out the accessories picture.

ON THE EASTERN SEABOARD, the big thing,

according to John Lamb, Jr. of Princeton, is
boots. Everybody seems to be wearing them
with informal clothing especially during the
winter months, for they obviate the need for
rubbers or galoshes, Ski jackets are now stan-
dard apparel as are heather crew-neck sweaters, Subdued, dark
colors rule the sport jacket scene. Worn with them are colored or
striped button-downs and repp ties. Moving over to the casual side
of the wardrobe, dark-colored flannel slacks give way to severely
tapered trousers. For dress up occasions, smooth leather loafers or
wing tips; for casualwear, brushed leather loafers or chukka boots,

NEXT MONTH the Old Order passes to make way for the New

ESQUIRE’s recently-elected 1966 College Advisory Board will be
preparing to head for New York to help us authenticate the newest
campus fashion trends and innovations. See you then,
