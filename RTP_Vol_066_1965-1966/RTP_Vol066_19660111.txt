Dr. Cole To Address Founder's Day Assembly

 

Students Attend Self-Study
Discusston Last Monday

In a meeting Monday afternoon
with interested members of the stu-
dent body, Dr. Charles F. Phillips
led a discussion of issues pertinent
to the University Self-Study Report
on Admissions, Financial Aid, and
Academic Services.

The discussion was prefaced by a
showing of the University’s new Ad-
mission film strip. The 35 mm color
film, prepared by Guidance Asso-
ciates of New York, is designed to
augment the student recruiting pro-
gram. Commenting on the film, Ad-
mission Director James Farrar stated
the film compares very favorably
with those distributed by Princeton,
Trinty, and other comparable uni-
versities.

Initial discussion was concerned
with the possible initiation of a five-
day class week at W&L. Self-Study
Analyst Phillips stated that the fae-
ulty generally views such a propos-
al favorably. However, he pointed
out that a recent student referen-
dum favored the present system.

Student Body President, Fred Min-
del, expressed the opinion that the
EC viewed the poll as an insufficient
indication of popular student senti-
ment regarding the proposed five-
day week. He stated that the EC
plans to submit a more comprehen-
sive referendum in February which
hopefully will better reflect student
Opinion

Concerning a possible liberalized
schedule, Dr. Phillips
the several disadvant-
ages increased flexibility would im-
pose. He felt that such a change
would not only prove inordinately
inconvenient for faculty members,
but would also tend to “push” un-
necessarily the Honor System.

In an answer to a suggestion that

examination
pointed out

first semester classes terminate be-
fore Christmas vacation, Phillips
stated that under such a system,

classes would have to begin in late
August. Freshman Camp registra-
tion would be pushed back corres-
pondingly. Such a schedule, Phillips
indicated, would conflict with sum-
mer schools in other colleges and
with summer employment of both
the faculty and students

The topic of Financial Aid prompt-
ed several questions concerning the
University’s taking advantage of
available federal funds. Dean Lewis
John, Director of Financial Aid ex-
plained that Washington and Lee
plans to participate in such programs
as the Federal Work-Study Plan and
the Educational Opportunities Grant
Program. Such programs, Dean
John commented, are aimed at at-
tracting superior students from low-
er income groups.

The concluding subject of the af-

ternoon discussion concerned Ad-

missions procedures. Dean Farrar
expressed the need in the Depart-
ment of Admissions for a full-time
staff member whose time would be
devoted to visiting secondary schools
and junior colleges, and seeking out
interested young men. Co-ordinating
the recruiting activities of alumni
chapters and increasing the distribu-
tion of Admissions publications were
cited other possible means of
improving W&L’s Admission Pro-
gram.

At

as

the close of the session, Dr.

Phillips stated that the final Self-
Study Report is still to be formu-

   

Dr. Charles F. Phillips

lated. Expressing a desire that the
final report will reflect a true Uni-
consensus, he urged both
members of the student body and
faculty to express their opinions at
subsequent open Self-Study discus-
sions

Plaque Raced
In Law School
By Young GOP

By RANDALL WEILL
Assistant Editor

Last Saturday in the Moot Court
Room of Tucker Hall, a memorial
plaque was dedicated in honor of
Clarence J. Brown, senior congress-
man from Ohio, who attended Wash-
ington and Lee Law School.

Donald O’Sullivan, a law student,
presented the plaque to Dean Light.
O’Sullivan was the chairman of this
Young Republican Club Activity,

The plaque reads: In memory of
Clarence J. Brown, 1893-1965, class
of 1916, district member of Congress
27 years. Presented by the Law
School Young Republican Club.
The plaque will be placed on the
wall of the Moot Court Room.

The late congressman’s son, Clar-
ence J. Brown, Jr., then offered a
few remarks. He commented on his
father’s pride tn Washington and
Lee and gratefully accepted the hon-
or on behalf of the Brown family.

Brown Replaces Father

Brown was elected to replace his
father in Congress. In an active cam-
paign he defeated seven other can-
didates for the office. He was even
aided in his campaign by L. Mendel
Rivers, Democratic Congressman
from South Carolina, and chairman
of the House Armed Forces Commit-
tee.

This was Brown's first visit to
Washington and Lee, and he was on
his way to Washington to be sworn
in, Ofter officially taking office yes-
terday, he assumed his father’s old
duties, among them service on the
House Armed Forces Committee.

The Clarence J. Brown Young Re-
publieans Club in the Law School
is one of two at Washington and
Lee. The undergraduate school has
its own Young Republicans Club,
totally independent from the Law
School.

The undergraduate club is the
largest in Virginia with over 300
members. Its president is Roger Wal-
lace, a junior from Texas. Interme-
diate Law student Ray Lajuenesse

 

Hunting Ledge.

heads the Law School club.

WEL ROTC
Plan To Recruit
Seniors For OCS

By SCOTT SNOWDEN

A program to recruit seniors for
the Officer Candidate School of the
Army is being instituted by the
ROIC department, it has been an-
nounced. This program is _ being
stressed by the Department of the
Army, as a result of the expansion
of the Army which is now under-
way, since an immediate increase in
requirements for junior officers has
occurred. To fill this need, it is nec-
essary to enlarge the present pro-
gram.

Self-Interest

The Department of the Army has
requested that it be stressed that
due to his continuing vulnerability
for military service, the prospective
applicant would find it in his own
self-interest as well as in the nation-
al interest to take advantage of the
opportunity to serve in an officer's
capacity.

Men accepted to this program must
complete Basic Combat Training,
Advanced Individual Training, and
then complete approximately 23
weeks of OCS training. In total, ap-
proximately 41 to 42 weeks are re-
quired before commissioning.

Brownley Coordinates

Students interested in the Officer
Candidate Program may obtain fur-
ther information from Col. Brown-
ley of the ROTC Department.

The Department of the Army,
while encouraging as many seniors
as possible to take the OCS option
program, emphasized that it is an
arduous program that 25 per cent of
the candidates do not complete.
The Army's 1966 recruitment goal
for this program is 2360.

Notice

Any persons having letters, man-
useripts, or other personal mem-
orabilia of the late John A. Graham
are requested to contact Professor
Robert Stewart of the Washington
and Lee Music Department. A col-
lection of Graham's works and writ-
ings are being assembled by the
University.

Speech Unannounced

President Cole will give a short
address to the University on as yet
an unannounced topic. In the past
the talk has dealt with some aspect
of the history of the University.

This special assembly has long
been an integral part of Washington
and Lee life. The celebration of
Robert E. Lee’s birthday has been
designated Founder’s Day for the
University.

Students are reminded that the
special assembly will replace the
normal exam schedule. Examinations
will begin again on Thursday morn-
ing at nine. The faculty will wear
academic gowns.

New Too Late

Approximately one year following the announcement of
the University to renovate the old Co-op, work has finally be-
gun on the long vacant building. Early yesterday morning work
crews began to set up the necessary equipment for the
$100,000 construction and renovation project scheduled for
completion in late spring.

We are particularly pleased with the prospect of a first-rate
campus book store which will hopefully eliminate the inade-
quate facilities now available. The book shop should provide
a wide variety of paperbacks at a reasonable cost if the tradi-
tional nature of a university cooperative store is maintained.
Unfortunately, the pricing policies of our present book store
as well as its appalling gaps leave much to be desired.

In a university which demands academic excellence it is
somewhat inconsistent not to provide the basic essentials—a
creditable book store for one. Granted that our library is hope-
lessly behind in the acquisition of current fiction and non-fic-
tional material, nevertheless, the paperback revolution in pub-
lishing provides an easy solution to this dilemma. If the Uni-
versity follows through with its intention to establish a “greatly
enlarged book shop,” it must guarantee optimum economic
advantages to the already financially overburdened college stu-
dent.

We are convinced that some sound financial policy can be
arranged so that students may purchase required or parallel
material at a minimum cost. Certainly much of the value of this
new addition will be lost if students are faced with the usual
commercial prices. Although this subject has been explored be-
fore, the Administration has not at this time given any indica-
tion of a new policy in the book store if, indeed, there is one.

We should like to cite the example of the co-op’s found in
a number of institutions in the Northeast where a workable
system is now in operation. We would suggest that the Uni
versity investigate the practical application of a similar system
if it has not already done so. In any event the institution of
extensive resources with existing pricing policies will represent
only partial improvement.

Slog: Sophisticated, Suave Senior
Reflects On Return Of Whole Man

By BERT PHILLIPS remarks as “the column bit it,” but

Slog is the guy with whom I live} 0 more,
in Lexington. Perhaps you know
Slog and walk with him through

 

 

It’s hard to be condescending and
energetic at the same time; thus,

 

 

the colonnade of our august and mel-
low university.

It's the phrase, “august and mel-
low,” which provokes my articula-
tion. For it’s Slog’s wording.

Sunday night he remarked in
passing through my room that the
article, “Death of the W
& Lee Man,” as Slog called it, by
columnist RideHer, “bit it.” (With
others he would have used an
euphemism, if he spoke at all, for
Slog is rather a gentleman.) He
also told me, for | walked inte his
room, that he would respond in
the Ring-tum Phi. But, ahh, the
papers he had to write....

Knowing Slog as I do, I feel that
a few years ago he would have re-
plied, read his masterpiece to me,
laughed nervously, typed it, given it
to the editor, then proofread the
copy before lunch on Tuesday. He
would have waited anxiously, though
nonchalantly, at supper. If no re-
marks were forthcoming, he would
have attempted to ellicit response.
Partially from curiosity, mainly from
egotism he would = ask...you
know “What-do-you-think-
about-this type type question.

But sieg has passed, in a period
of two years, from the folly of
adolescense to the wisdom of the
middle age. As a senior, he no
longer replies to columns. If not
peace, a profound boredom has
come ever him which only allows

 

With the exam period beginning
next Monday, the Executive Com-
mittee wishes to remind the stu-
dent body of its responsibility re-
garding the Honor System. We say
this particularly to the freshmen,
who have never experienced the
rigors of college final examinations
The next two weeks are probably
the most important in the semester,
consequently the pressure to do well
should be great. With this increased
pressure and tension inevitably goes
an inereased challenge to the Honor
System, as evidenced by the fact
that each vear, the number of Honor
cages that come before the Execu-
Committee during the exam
period are greater than at any other
me during the year

The Honor System has functioned
elatively well so far this vear. and

and discipline of the students. Per-
aps it might do well for all of us
io reflect hack upon this,

 

NOTICE

 

to insure |

unless I tell you what we talked
about, it will go unsaid. Not that it
really matters, I suppose.

Slog said the problem with his
writing a response to Mr. Ride Hers
column would be, along with his
school work, too much for his ever-
whelming laziness to bear. Too much
worry about being clever and using
suitable parallel style structure to
parellel (he loves puns) such pro-
vocative, or prevoking, paragraphs
as:

“Today's University is no long-
er concerned with the develop-
ment of the whele man. Gone are
the men in the college adminis-
tration and the professors who val-
ued the creative tradition of the
University, whe sought to share
with the younger men an under-
standing of an honorable way of
life. Today's men simply do their
jobs and they do their jobs well
as administrators and academic
teachers—but they do not bother
about the quality of life, the quali-
ty of the individual, at this Uni-
versity (sice).”

Today Slog, sitting in his room in
his chair in his underwear, is not
aware of or concerned with the de-
velopment of the whole man. Gone is
the sophomore era in which he felt
a “whole man” wasn't such an ab-
surd thing, such an oiled cliche it
would roll down the Lee Chapel hill,

(Continued on page 4)

that the proper perspective is main-
tained, Exams are important and
final grades are important, but
neither even remotely approaches
the importance of our responsibility
to the Honor System. The majority
of the violations of the Honor Sys-
tem seem to be “spontaneous lapses
of perspective.” which might very
well have been avoided with a little
reflection ahead of time.

The Executive Commitiee by no
means feels that it is necessary to
“warn” the student body of thei
responsibility. Almost without ex-
ception, it ia hot even necessary to
remind, especially to those who have
already experienced an exam period
Rather, this statement is written in
the hope that, should the pressure
on one single student become ex-
tremely intense, this additional re-
flection will keep his highest re-
sponsibility in its proper perspective

Lee Favors Organization

 

By BOB LEE

In some weeks to come, the stu-
dent body will be subjected to num-
erous articles ap-
pearing in this
paper enumerat-
ing both the ad-
vantages and dis-
advantages of our
joining the Na-
tional Student As-
sociation. Many of
these articles and
letters will be ad
hominum —argu-
ments urging the
student body to
reject membership because of some
of the political views attributed to
the national convention of N. S. A.
They will doubtlessly allude to some
of the more “extreme” policy pro-
nouncements of this organization and
subtly suggest that only by reject-

 

ing membership in N. S. A. ean we
properly “articulate” our dissent of
these views. They will ignore alto-
gether. as one might expect, the pal-
pably beneficial services this organ-
ization can render this University.
The style of their attack, so well
disguised, will be in keeping with
the traditions of those organizations
which will be its principle sponsors.
Their rhetoric often marred by dis-
tortion, over-simplification and in-
nuendo, will befit their intellectu-
ality. Their attack will reveal that
sickening fear that typifies similar
groups through this country which
conjure up a suspicious and cor-
rosive hatred for all ideas and in-
stitutions which, because of their
unorthodoxy or complexity, elude
their simple bigoted minds.
Criticisms Listed

But to do justice to these groups,

Birthday-Founders Day Convoca-
tion. If the speech delivered at this
assembly follows in the tradition of
past assembly speeches, we will hear
some minor event in the life of Rob-
ert E. Lee. The incident described
will be almost totally unrelated to
modern life. Such a speech will not
be unusual at Washington and Lee.
In my previous three years at the
University, I have heard speeches
either void of profound or novel
ideas or bloated with soon forgotten
plans for the future. (The book store,
promised over three semesters ago,
is still in the planning stages.)

The University Assembies pre-
sent the few opportunities for ma-
jor addresses by the Administra-
stration of Washington and Lee.
Reflective and speculative thought
concerning education, universities
in the United States, and Washing -
ton and Lee could be of benefit to
all. The Lee College proposal dealt
only with a quantitative measure.
There has been almost ne mention
of the qualitative aspects of educa-
tion,

Admiitedly Washington and Lee is
not in the throes of the problems
suffered by the multiversities. We
have no tenure protests or free
speech movements, and this is prob-
ably to our credit. But we would
be naive to assume our university is
perfect as it stands. Why is it that
as James Bryant Conant said,
“American Higher Edueation has
many virtues, but it is net charac-
ized by candor”?

The University Assemblies could
be used as more than a means for
the Registrar's Office to determine
what students are no longer at-
tending Washington and Lee. One
would assume they could serve as
forums for educators concerned
with the trends of education in our
society. Such concern is in evi-
dence elsewhere.

In November 1965, the Atlantic
Monthly devoted a special section to
“The Troubled Campus.” Articles
in that issue dealt with the hiring
and promotion
sources of student unrest, “Beleag-
ured Professors” and “The Plight of
the Small College” This last article
by W. Allen Wallis. the President of

of prolessors,

thoughts have implications for
Washington and Lee.

Obviously there are many sig-
nificant and controversial issues alive
in the nation’s universities. I am dis-
turbed to think that at Wash-
ington and Lee these issues are
closed, or that the Administration
has nothing to say.

Note: It would be a pleasure to be
proved wrong next Wednesday.

 

 

ciprocate, let us examine their argu-
ments. In a recent letter to the
Ring-tum Phi, one of their spokes-
men suggested that Washington and
Lee should not join N. S. A. because
the national convention of the or-
ganization has: 1) Urged the aboli-
tion of the House Un-American
Activities Committee; 2) condemned
American intervention in the Do-
minican Republic; 3) urged the ces-
sation of the bombing of North Viet
Nam and unconditional negotiation;
4) criticized the American college
fraternity system; 5) urged the ad-
mission of Red China into the United
Nations and 6) urged unilateral dis-
armament. I might humbly suggest
that the national convention of N.
S. A. has never proposed unilater-
al disarmament. It has. however,
adopted the other resolutions.

It is remarkable that out of the in-
numerable policies this group has
advocated, only mention of the afore-
mentioned was made. The organiza-
tion has been unequivocal in its con-
sistent advocacy of such seditious
principles as equal opportunity for
all Americans and equal protection
of the law. Since the letter’s author
so meticulously avoids mention of
these and similar proposals, I assume
he substantially agrees with them.
The dynamic aspect of our system of

 

Tyler Sees Solution To A

NSA’s Benefits Too Great to Pass Up

government is its allowance for dis-
agreement and debate. On any ques-
tion of policy, honest and intelligent
men will differ, and no man will
agree with all the policies of any of
the organizations of which he is a
member. Are we being asked to sac-
rifice the benefits this organization
can provide because we may disagree
with some of their political ideas?

What disturbs me most is the im-
plication that should Washington and
Lee join N. S. A., it would be asso-
ciated with or “stigmatized” by those
proposals of which the majority of
the student body disapproved. This
is wholly untrue. The national con-

of minority reports on those ques-

of schools disapprove. Thus, should
the student body of Washington and
Lee disapprove of policy statements
by the organization, its representa-
tives can make their dissent patently
clear by suscribing to the minority
report. We are not in any way

In Independent Study Program

By ROY TYLER

While glancing through last Fri-
day’s edition of the Ring-tum Phi,
two seemingly unrelated articles
caught my eve. One was written by
Jim Awad concerning a proposed
independent study program, while
the other was written by Bruce
Rider concerning the lack of what
Rider terms “... the Washington and
Lee man.”

A solution?

I am not convinced, as Mr. Rider
is, that the “Washington and Lee
man” is gone from the Lexington
scene. This is, however, true to some
degree. I do not feel that there is
any sure-fire way to solve the prob-
lem, but such proposals as the one
Mr. Awad has brought forth might
be a start.

It appears that the problem that
Mr. Rider has called to our atten-
tion, that of how, as students we could
take more pride in our school, could
be solved by giving those who feel
that they have nothing of which to
be proud, something to make them
change their minds.

Same Old Apathy

Much of the criticism leveled at
W&L by those who go to school here
is directly concerned, or can be re-
lated to, the apathy, disinterest, or
downright laziness of the student
body in general. The simple solution
would be to give the students of
W&L something to demand their in-
terest beyond the fifteen or so hours

 

of classes each person attends dur-
ing the week. A good start would
be the independent study program
proposed by Mr. Awad.

One thing, however, comes to mind
when most people mention indepen-
dent study... vacation. One month to
ski, take trips, etc....and then re-
turn two or three days before your
project is due and grind out some
pitiful excuse for an independent
study project and hand it in... or
perhaps not hand it in at all.

Minimum Standards

I think that the system now in
effect at Colgate to which Mr. Awad
calls attendtion in his article, would
be one of the best ways to begin
the program at Washington and Lee.
Assuredly there would be a necessi-
ty for making some minimum re-
quirement in the program, and the
issuing of grades which really meant
something.

If each student is required to turn
in a certain quality project (“pass-
ing,” “failing,” or “honors,” as in Mr.
Awad’s proposal), there might be
a little more interest taken in the
program than if the student were en-
tirely free to do as he pleased and
produce what he wished.

Interest Based

The entire program is built on in-
terest, which, some might say, would
be completely destroyed if the stu-
dent were “forced” into an indepen-
dent study program. I doubt that this

Examination Time Is

By BRUCE W. RIDER

It is now January all of a sudden,
and in less than a week we will be
plunging into final exams, the World
Series of academic life.

A goodly number of our students
who have not yet learned how to
play the academic game are getting
all tense and anxious as exam time
approaches. But we who are older
and somewhat wiser know better.

Next to Spring Vacation, exami-
nation time is the biggest holiday
the University has to offer. It is
a time to drink beer and sleep late
and drink beer and see movies and
drink beer and lay detailed plans
for Faney Dress and drink beer.
Let's face, as they say, the facts.
By the time exams come along, either
you have studied like a good little
boy or you have not. If you have
studied, exams hold no fear. And if
you haven't done your work. what
the heil-—it's too late to worry about
it now

Perhaps it would help all of us to
think about why final examinations
are given in the first place. The main
reason, to be truthful, is that exam-
imations are given because the pro-
fessors have read on page 98 in the
Catalogue that professors are sup-
posed to give final examinations

But it does take some of the
pressure off the student te know
that professors rarely grade the
things. Any man in his right mind
(or @ profesor) isn't about to
spend hour upon hour wading
through a bunch of illegible ex-
am books.

Nothing at all.

Grades are given, as we all know,
on much different standards. Seniors
majoring in the subject are given
A’s. Juniors, in the same manner,
are given B's in the course if they
are majors. The rest of the students
(who shouldn't be in there cluttering
up the class in the first place) are
given C’s. Freshmen and sophomores
are alway's given C’s because they
are freshmen and sophomores.

Why, then, ask you, perceptive
reader that you are, have any
tests at all?

Tests and quizzes are given by the

the professor was in college (be-
fore the rise of the Medieval com-
munes) and now that he is teach-
ing, he thinks he is supposed to
give tests, too. (3) He doesn’t like
young people, and tests provide an
outlet for the professor's hostility,

Charlie Bensinger may be correct
in claiming that Chuek Stobbs holds
the record for the wildest pitch in
the history of baseball, but the most
famous wild pitches belongs to a man
who probably saw his baseball ca-
reer come to an end last season. Of
course you remember Ryne Duren
when he was the flame throwing
relief ace for the New York Yan-
kees. Duren was feared by all the
American League hitters because he
wears spectacles as thick as a volume
of Doctor Zhivago. They were afraid
that with his speed and inability to
see very well he would kill some-
one. Duren almost got one man,
whose name escapes me at the mo-
ment. The funny thing is that the
man he beaned was in the on-deck
circle. The first person to give me the
name of the man who was hit by
gets as a prize my autograph,

Do You Like Job Insecurity?

Wanted: a man who knows some-
thing about football, who is able to
get along with 240 pound monsters,
who likes to move from one job to
the next, and who likes to be booed
by at least 50,000 people at one time.
This advertisement is not paid for
by the several National Football
League teams that are looking for
coaches. This is the year for firing
and hiring of coaches. Thus far, it is
early yet, the Los Angeles Rams, the
Washington Redskins, and the Pitts-
burgh Steelers have removed last
year’s coaches. The Atlantic Falcons
have yet to have a coach. The NFL’s
newest member has at least 40 play-
ers and no coach. Maybe the Falcons
are going to try something new, like
playing an entire season without a
ce oach.

The St. Louis Cardinals may also
be in the market for a genuis to re-
place Wally Lemm. The Cardinals
matched the Minnesota Vikings as
the biggest disappointments of the
65 season.

Mike Nixon, the deposed Steeler
coach, wins the award as the bravest
man of ’65. Nixon said that he would
not quit; he would have to be fired.
And he was. Nixon was once the
head coach of the Redskins and was
replaced by Bill McPeak, who was
fired this week. There is a good
chance that Nixon will once again be

replaced by McPeak. It’s like musical }

chairs.
Same Names Every Year

It’s funny that the same names al-
ways are mentioned for the available
coaching positions. George Wilson,
who once coached the Detroit Lions
and this year was the offensive coach
of the Redskins, and Paul Brown,
well known as the coach of the
Cleveland Browns not too long ago,
are mentioned by everybody as pos-
sibilities for the vacancies .Bud Wil-
kinson, of Oklahoma fame, has had
his name crop up a few times too.
Probably none of them will get a
job.

The same thing happens in base-
ball. Every year a team looking for
a manager will be rumored to be
talking to Leo Durocher. Leo finally
made it back this year with the
Chicago Cubs. Five will get you ten
that he does not last more than two
years. Also it is a good bet that
Leo will lead the National League
managers in getting ejected from the
games, while the Cubs won't lead
the le rague in anything.

The W&L grapplers added another
victory to its record with a 33-8
conquest of Richmond Professional

'64-'65

Win Total With Victory
Over Lynchburg Hornets

By CHARLIE FRERET

Washington and Lee’s basketball
fortunes blew hot and cold this past
weekend as they defeated Lynch-
burg Friday night by the score of
86-66, but bowed to the University
of North Carolina at Charlotte Sat-
urday night, 75-65.

Against Lynchburg, W&L dis-
played one of its best team efforts
to date as it held Lynchburg star
Wayne Proffit to a mere 17 points.
This was the second lowest point
production of the year with his
lowest, 14, against the same W&L
team in December. This is a credit to
the Generals’ defense as Profit had
scored 40 points against Randolph-
Macon Wednesday night.

He then outdid that perform-
ance Saturday by scoring 52. Lead-
ing five starters who all hit in double
figures were Rob Bauer, 29 points,
and Frank Morrison, 15 points. Bauer
played his usual outstanding game,
and Morrison, elevated to a starting
position in place of Steve Sweitzer,
continued to display good basketball
talent. Also, noteworthy was the
play of Earl Edwards, starting for the
injured Bob Spessard. Edwards
dumped in 11 points, rebounded well,
and turned in a good all around per-
formance.

It was a strong W&L team which
erased a 33-32 halftime deficit and
gradually pulled away in Lynch-
burg’s bandbox. However, Proffit
wasn’t stopped completely as late in
the game he suddenly punched Gen-
eral guard John Carrere. The par-
tisan crowd spilled onto the court
and the referees had their hands full
in preventing a riot. Order was final-
ly restored but not until one excited
fan was carried away for engaging
in some fisticuffs with one of the refs.

This was the only time Friday night
that W&L was to come out on the
short end of a contest.

Then on Saturday night W&L took
on UNC of Charlotte, which handed
the Generals a 78-76 setback on their
home court in December. Apparent-
ly, the Generals were tired from
the night before as they were unable
to stop Lawrence and McGinty of
Charlotte as this pair scored 57 of
their teams’ 74 points.

W&L led by 3 at the nalf, 31-28.
But Charlotte came out in the sec-
ond half to take a quick 7 point
lead. The closest the Generals could
get was 3 points with a little less
than four minutes left. However,
three bad passes in succession
stymied Wé&L’s chances to catch up.
Lawrence had the hottest hand in
Charlotte’s second half comeback as
he hit 11 straight field goals and 3
foul shots for 25 points in that half.
He had a game high total of 31. Me-
Ginty followed up with 26 points.
Rob Bauer paced the General's’ of-
fense with 23 points, while Frank
Morrison chipped in with 18.

The Generals continue their home
stand this week with three games.
Tuesday pits the Generals against
RPI, Thursday finds Bridgewater
here, and Saturday Eeastern Men-
nonite plays W&L. All three games
are slated to begin at 8 with the
freshman team playing a prelimi-
nary game at 6:15 before the
Bridgewater game.

Slog Canaidlave Reture Of The Whole Man

(Continued from page 2)

and in which he felt the college
faculty sought to share with him an
understanding of an archaic “honor-
able” way of life, rather than an
understanding of the complexities of
life itself, which—honorable, dis-
honorable, or not particularly hon-
orable—do exist. Today’s Slog does
his job rather simply—and he does
his job as a student not too terribly
well—but, in his room, he does dis-
creetly bother about the quality of
life, the quality of the individual, at
this august and mellow university.

Slog’s column would have been
titled “Let Us Now Praise Disturbed
Young Men.” It would have begun
with an epigraph:

Through the columns they come,
go past,

Talking of trivia, they walk so
Sit, a0

Initially, Slog maintained, the es-
say wouldn’t have been long, since
there wasn’t too much to be praised
in the way of disturbed young men.
But his suggestions...that’s differ-
ent. They’re absolutely shocking.

He agreed with Ride Her’s point
“we students of today are much too
smart, too self-assured, too grown up
to concern ourselves with such a
useless thing as the quality of uni-
versities;” but the implied rationale
of the increasing academic orienta-
tion whisking away the “quality of
the University,” he felt was, to use
his phrase, “slightly boring.”

Let’s face it, he said. Not too rue-
fully either. This Washington & Lee
gentleman, if he ever did exist,
dosen't now, et tant pis.

Slog wondered if the Washington
& Lee gentleman got his hair cut
at the Hotel, ate meatball sand-
wiches at the College Inn, bought
beer at the East Lexington Grocery
had coffee at Doc’s and knew he
could buy’em at the bus station.
He wondered if this lost whole man
listened to Mozart and read Goethe
at the same time to calm down af-
ter a hard statistics problem,
whether on Saturday night he
shucked his racoon coat at the
gymnasium door and danced the
W&L Swing till two o'clock in the
morning with some lost whole girl
from Hollins...

Slog sees the problem as this.

Lee, he has already been assualted
by the $5,000 worth of pamplets is-
sued by the fraternities during the
summer. A week after he gets here,
he has become, not just a W&L man,
but a “bratha” as well, on his way
to being a well-rounded-Washing-
ton-Lee-gentle-fraternity-man. It
works quite smoothly: those few
other brathas—sophomores who skip
rush dates, to drink the house’s beer
in a car, seniors who've “had it,”
and the few football players who
miss rush dates are covered for by
a whole lot of other quasi-whole men
in a dark basement throbbing with
rock n’ roll, that balm of college
life; and shortly, provided there
seems to be a distinct possibility of
the rushee becoming a whole man
himself, they catch a hold of him
by his rep tie, lead him upstairs, and
suavely deliver the bid with all the
psychological wisdom of a_ high
school football coach they remember
from once so long ago.

Thus, the new man is safe, To
be involved is to be absolved.
Slog’s argument, follows, quite
rashly: the freshman shouldn't step
foot into a fraternity house, or be
able to drive a car, until after his
first semester. Slog agrees he would
hurt some. But is this so bad? he
asks. Maybe if he was lonely, he’d
think. And there should be an aca-

 

(Continued from page 2) |
membership. We have because this

demic course, Slog said, that would
force him to think even if he didn’t
want to, since, usually, he hadn't
ever before. It would be an English
course in which there were no books,
only papers. Three a week, one each
class period. And the papers would
provoke him, cajole him, ask him,
force him to think about himself—his
past, his future, his likes, his dis-
likes. It would ask him to attempt
to make connections; it would ask
why? why? why? when the only
answer was seemingly because, be-
cause, because; but because just
wouldn’t do.

And he would suffer, yes. He
would be confused, yes. He would
go down those grey shady paths
and yes, he would wish they were
black or white, yes. It would be
painful, this contrived-but-not-too-
contrived apparatus to make him

ask that flea-bitten question, “Who
am I?” Could he stop asking un-
til he had a glimpse of the truth?
Slog summed up quite philosophi-
cally while he smoked in bed. The
University would return. Perhaps it
would want its inmates to love it
rather than to love one another.
Somehow, I felt vaguely offended
by Slog. His way seemed radical.
But, then, Ride Her’s way came
off rather reactionary. There
must be some less painful way.

Frosh Basketball
Team Wins Over
Lynchburg

By DAVID DOLLAR
Last Friday night’s freshman
basketball game proved to be ex-
tremely close for the Brigadiers. The
baby Generals won a 63-62 cliff-
hanger.

The Lynchburg College Hornets
enjoyed a four-point lead at half-
time, but W&L’s freshmen came
back strong to eke out their second
victory of the season.

The difference in the game was
decided at the free throw line. Al-
though both teams dropped in 26
field goals, the Brigadiers sunk
eleven [ree shots to ten for the Hor-
nets.

Larry Boetsch led the Brigadiers
in scoring with 17 points, but he
was followed closely by Rick Mc-
Millan and Bucky Cunningham
with 16 each. In addition MecMil-
lan took down fifteen rebounds.

For Lynchburg McKinley scored
eighteen, Jordan fourteen, and three
others each scoreing eight points.

The Brigadiers now have a 2-3
record as they face Bridgewater Col-
lege here Thursday, January 13.

for a year.

panying Mr. Boyd on this tour may
contact him at his office in duPont
Hall or at 463-4336 for further de-
tails. It is recommended that inter-
ested applicants see Mr. Boyd at
their earliest convenience.

ommending to the Administration |
the abolition of Saturday classes. But
we must present an equitable, reas-
onable and a more desirable alter-
native to present policy if our sug-
gestions are to be considered. Many
of the schools which belong to N.S.A.
have classes scheduled on a five day
basis, and N. S. A. can provide in-
formation of the respective systems
from which we can draft our sugges-
tions. N.S. A. is also associated with
European youth organizations which
have in the past provided informa-
tion and services to American stu-
dents traveling abroad. By joining
N. S. A., Washington and Lee stu-
dents could more easily qualify for
such assistance. All this can be real-
ized for the less than exhorbitant
cost of $15 per year.

I would like to conclude by posing
a challenge to those who wish to
obstruct our membership because
they disapprove of their political pro-

would be the case, however. Surely
some would feel this way, but others
would feel that at last Washington

vention of N. S. A. If your ideas
are sound and your beliefs right, it
is not inconceivable that a majority
of delegates at the national conven-
tion can be persuaded to coneur in
your opinion. But you accomplish
nothing by ignoring the challenge.
And if the student body is persauded
to reject N.S. A. because of some po-
litical views, we shall all have lost
something of our intellectual integ-
rity.
