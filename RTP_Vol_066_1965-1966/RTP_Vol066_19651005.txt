lifty-five Enter
Deferred Rush As
IFC Defines Rules

By BILL WILKERSON

This week begins the semester-long
Deferred Rush period. Aabout fifty-
five freshmen attended a half-hour
meeting last Thursday night at which
details of Deferred Rush were dis-
cussed by IFC representatives.

At the meeting Chuck Griffin, IFC
President, emphasized the import-
ance of the freshmen to pay particu-
lar attention to the houses from
which they received bids. Sixteen
of the freshmen in Deferred Rush
received bids.

Freshmen who have not received
bids are generally hopeful that the
length of deferred rush will enable
the fraternities to look more careful-
ly at them. The freshmen who have
received bids hope to be able to see
behind the Rush Week fronts.

Rules in Effect

Although Deferred Rush is much
more informal than Rush Week,
Chuck Griffin said, “Such things as
dirty rush can still take place dur-
ing Deferred Rush, and rules per-
taining to this type of thing are still
in effect.”

Depledging well pledging
takes place during Deferred Rush
When a depledge occurs, the frater-
nity reports to the IFC. The fresh-
man enters a non-contract period of
two weks after which he is eligible
to visit and join another house.

In addition to Chuck Griffin, John
Burke, IFC Rush Chairman, Geoff
Butler, Jody Luck and Barry
Vaught, members of the Judicial
Council, were present at the Defer-

A Practical Approach

Even the casual observer of this year’s freshman class is
struck by the almost universal disregard of the name tag con-
vention. Although this is only the second year of this “‘tradi-
tion,” it is apparent that the system is not functioning properly.
Despite efforts of the IFC and the Assimilation Committee
to provide replacements and a certain amount of moral sausion
the system has failed miserably.

Return to the Beanie

In view of this deteriorating situation we suggest a return
to the more characteristic mode of freshman assimilation—
the beanie. Admittedly, the beanie is not the most attractive
or dignifying item one might wear, but it serves one very real
function and does so effectively. It easily identifies the fresh-
man and at the same time promotes a degree of cohesiveness
within the class.

The name tag, however noble in theory, is nonetheless
highly impractical in reality. Freshmen are constantly loosing
or inadvertently destroying these flimsy appendages making
replacement a full time operation. The beanie is certainly more
durable, and if we can draw on past experience, the instance
of loss is not nearly so great.

A Semblance of Respect

Quite apart from the merits of either the name tag or beanie
convention, it should be obvious to all that the assimilation of
freshmen in the last few years has left a lot to be desired. In
order to restore some semblance of respect for the waning
traditions of conventional dress and speaking, a new approach
to freshman orientation must be undertaken.

It is our opinion that the name tag convention is im-
practical and does not enjoy the respect of a large number of
freshmen. A return to the beanie may provide an atmosphere
of respect for our traditions, which is so sadly lacking at this
time.

The University Book Store

“There is nothing new under the Sun”
—Ecclesiastes

 

A perennial campus complaint which receives great at-
tention and little action every year is that of the University
book store. The complaints range from the impoverished fresh-
man who feels he has been taken to the cleaners to the out-
raged upperclassman who—already reconciled to the high
prices—is further tripped up by the unreasonable hours which
the store is open. Any of these complaints have merit.

Bad Business

We have no way of knowing whether the inflated book
prices are unnecessary, but we can make an informed judgment
on the necessity of closing the book store at 4:30 p.m. This
early closing is not only inconvenient; it is bad business and
thoroughly anti-commercial. The store manages to close just
as most students are getting out of labs, and those who run it
will respond neither to passionate pleas nor tappings on the
window. After 4:30 p.m., you can forget it.

A Competitive Co-op
The Book Shop on Washington Street remains open some
nights until 6:00 p.m., as does the newly-opened Old Dominion
Stationery store. We see no reason why the University book
store cannot become, if not competitive, then at least business-
like. The Ring-tum Phi urges the hours of the book store be
expanded, and soon.

doesn't excuse the Homecomings-

incomprehensible reason, the date
for Homecomings is picked from the
home games two years or so in ad-

sponsibility of whomever does this
to make the date late in the season

Openings is meant to officially open

Lee Examines Role Of Critic

 

Reciprocal Concept of Responsibility
Viewed As Fundamental In Our Society

By BOB LEE

Today, we are more prone than in
any former time to ponder the re-
lationship of the individual vis-a-
vis the society of which he is a mem-~
ber. This relationship, we are re-
minded, is predicated on the principle
of reciprocal responsibility. This is,
the community ean make available
to the individual certain benefits
which the individual could not con-
ceivably realize apart from society.
But the individual too must assume
certain responsibilities which com-
plement those of society—the respon-
sibility of seeing that those benefits
are offered to all members of the
community, and not deliberately or
capriciously denied some—that the
very system is “impregnated” with a
sense of justice and purpose.

Washington and Lee is in many
respects a microcosm of the “great-
er society” into which we will be
eventually thrust. If it is to survive,
it must function on the same prin-
ciples as those of society. In short,
it can offer the student the promise
of intellectual and social fulfillment.
But do not these benefits imply the
right of the institution to make de-
mands upon he individual; and if
this is true, as I believe it is, what
is to be the nature of such demands?

Nature of Demands

Concisely, it is the obligation of
the student to “applaud” when the
community fulfills its responsibilities
and seeks to expand the scope of its
enterprise. But should the community
become delinquent in the perfor-
mance of its duties, it becomes in-
cumbent upon the student to criti-

 

cize, exhort, and reprove. Thus the
role of the student becomes that of
a participant—to insure that neither
party defaults in the performance
of their responsibilities, to condemn
the student who seeks to wrest from
community all he ean without con-
tributing anything of himself and to
reprehend the community which
suppresses the individual initiative
and talent of its members. In either
instance, such selfish pursuit leaves
only a void, a vacuum in which
neither the individual nor society
can prosper,

The student need not be a eynie,
but he must remain an interested and
critical observer. He must not aban-
don that cause which he believes to
be just simply because the source
of his anxiety—he is teld—is time-
honored, tmie-cherished tradition. It
is noteworthy to remind oneself that
“no tradition can survive in oppo-
sition to the eonsensus of contem-
porary thought and feeling.” The
majority of men are disposed to up-
hold what they conceive to be just,
and if a tradition or convention is
founded on the principles of justice,
its claim to posterity cannot be de-
nied. Those “ideals” which served
our predecessors at Washington and
Lee so admirably may not provide
the correctives necessary today, and
to defend them SOLELY on the
basis of their past value is to di-
minish any present value. Change
should not be advocated for change’s
sake, nor should change be spurned
when the need of reform manifests
itself to the dictates of reason.

 

 

 

Problems Of Distressed Freshmen

By Advice Of Ominscient Upperclassman

By BRUCE RIDER

As I was pushing my powerful
Honda down Main Street the other
afternoon, I came
upon a freshman
who was sitting on
the curb looking
very sad indeed.
™ “Hello, lad,”
_ said 1, Speaking
First because I am
an upholder of
| great and magni-
ficent _ traditions.
“why so pale and
wan?”
“Oh, Sir,” said
he, “I am in the deepest distress, for
I have lost my little name tag and
now nobody will know I am a fresh-
man.”

“Nonsense, my boy.” retorted L
“Anyone could tell at a glance that
you are but a freshman, name tag
or noe.”

“Really, Sir?”

“Quite. Here, if you will be so
kind as to push my Honda I will
walk along beside you and explain

 

how can one tell
whether a man is a sophomore, a
junior, or whatever else there can
be.”

“You are most kind, Sir.”

“We have but one rule, my son—
and damn if I can remember what
it is. In any event. it is my pleasure
to further your education.”

I will new relate to you gentle
reader, the substance of my conver-
sation with this particular freshman.
(1 must admit that I was startled
when he told me he was born in
1948. Man, I remember 1948. But, on
with the tale).

First, of course, we have the
Freshman. He dresses a bit shabbily,
mostly because his parents are mak-
ing him wear out his high school
clothes before buying him new ones.
Hence the white sock, the too-short
trousers, and the nasty thin little
ties. He usually travels by foot, since
he is not allowed to have a ear this
first year. Beneath his seemingly
self-confident look there beats a
heart of fear: he does net know the
what the future has in store for him.

at a glance

Let us not be tempted to deny the
legitimacy of complaint. There can-
not be a single sphere of our lives at
Washington and Lee which should
be arbitrarily exempted as unsuitable
for debate. The greater the influence
a particular institution, tradition or
convention has on our lives, the more
imperative it becomes that its value
is questioned. To argue, for instance,
that those who oppose conventional
dress are without cause is to plead
ignorance. The value of such a con-
vention can be determined only after
seriously weighing both its advan-
tages and disadvantages.. No useful
purpose can be accomplished by ig-
noring the merits of an opposing
viewpoint, as no useful purpose can
be served by blatant disregard or
contravention of established pro-
cedure, justly derived. Such behav-
ior reveals only a root discontent for

one’s own ideals and nullify the
opportunities of free expression. The
right to criticize presupposes a re-
sponsibility which the critic must not
ignore. There are accepted avenues
of protest, and there are those which
shall always, I hope, remain unae-
ceptable.

It is now time for the whole stu-
dent body to get out of the grand-
stand and get onto the playing field.
lest we condemn by deference or |

Delayed Rush

Less Strenuous

To those of us who are freshmen,
there is a great deal of confusion
surrounding rush week which has
still to be worked out. The objective
of the whole program with different
to aequaint students with different
fraternities, but I can hardly see
how a long series of short visits to
houses where everybody looks like
everybody else, is the ultimate solu-
tion. All the smiles, free eats, spark-
ling rooms, and glowing hospitality
are hardly typical of a fraternity
once rush week is over.

For this reason, it seems that de-
layed rush offers a much more real-
istic look at fraternities. First, you
get a chance to find out what the
house is really like. Then you have
a longer period to watch the house
activilies and participation in campus
life. The atmosphere during deferred
rush is less strenuous and clears
away many of the barriers to a
sensible, unemotional decision by

'the potential pledge.

It is not unreasonable to think
that in the future more and more
students will choose to participate
in deferred rush. Even this year
a number of men who were offered
several bids chose to delay their de-
cisions until they could get at the

truth of the fraternity situation.

Ruffin Ponders Seniors

” Fate;

Undecided Set for Law School

By NICK RUFFIN

The scene is a conversation be-
tween two W&L seniors.

“Joe, what are you going to do
after you get out of this place?”

“This girl at Hollins is after me
to marry her, and her old man would
give me a job; but I don’t think it's
worth it. I don’t know what I want
to do; | guess I'll go to law school.”

The Uncommitted

Not long ago a student who did not
know what he wanted to do would
often go into the Army. Those who
were more fortunate would go to
school in Europe to absorb culture.
The Vietnam situation made mili-
tary service even less desirable than
it was before the hot, cold War, so
a new out was discovered.

The uncommitted at W&L are go-
ing to law school. These prospective
law students can not be character-
ized by major or fraternity. They
appear to knew little about law
school fer the practice of law.
While a few are dedicated to be-
coming lawyers most are united by
a lack of direction and a surprising
naivete.

A Love of the Law?
Realizing that seven years in the
town of Lexington can cause dis«
turbing deterioration of one's senses,
most W&L seniors choose to pursue
their legal training elsewhere. A few
who find the road trips and the ex-'|

 

citement of campus polities alluring
choose to remain here.

Professors and practicing lawyers
say that a law student must be dedi-
cated to succeed in law school. He
must have more than a casual in-
terest; he must love the law. To
those who are going to law school
to find themselves, I say “good luck.”

Dream of Success

With the multitude of career op-
portunities available it is surprising
that so many studenis stumble inte
law school. Many of the prospective
lawyers have done well in their ma-
jors, and would presumably be
headed for a career in some way re-
lated to their study here. Another
remarkable feature of the prospective
student at W&L is his dream of
material success achieved through
law. It is the desire for wealth rather
than an interest in law that inspires
many students. The big Mustang
in the sky beckons. I am not against
wealth, and I do not claim that law-
vers interested in material success
will fail: but graduation from law
school does not guarantee one a
house in the suburbs. The average
lawyer is not a wealthy man: he
eould probably draw more income
driving a truck. (1 ignore the loss of
stills.)

At the present time there is a glut
of lawyers in the major cities of the

Last Friday Washington and Lee’s Varsity soccer team

Kirkpatrick Goal Decisive

With the final quarter waning rap-
idly, both teams waged a desperate
battle to seore the winning goal.
Finally, with 1:04 left in the game
Dave Kirkpatrick maneuvered for
a perfect kick to put the Generals
ahead 2-1. In the last seconds of
the game the Yellow Jackets’ drive
was repelled and Washington and
Lee had its second triumph.

Although the entire W&L team is
to commended for a fine display of
teamwork, special recognition should
go to Redmond, Henry and Kirkpat-
rick as vital eogs in the winning
effort. Their strong, steady play
kept the opposition off balance the
majority of the game.

holds a 4-3 decision over Macon.

Student Attacks Footballers;
Passing Game, Spirit Hit

Washington and Lee football this
year has the potential of having one
of the finest teams in the area. It
has respectable size and experience
on the line and, despite a lack of
speed, a tough, agile set of backs.
Most of the players have been work-
ing together for more than full
season and there is little reason that
they should not win. But they
haven't. They have been shut out
in both their first two encounters.
They have been beaten by good
teams, but they need not have lost.
There are two reasons for their
problems; lack of spirit and inade-
quate passing attack.

a

If a football team is to function
properly, it members must be “up”
for the game. They must be ready
not only physically but mentally.
If a team does not really want a
ball game, its chances of getting it
are slim. At the beginning of prac-
tice this fall few members of the
team thought that attitude would
be a major problem. But, attitude
has been a key difficulty so far this
season.

In the opening game, W&L out-
played Randolph-Macon for a quar-
ter and half but was unable to

period they lost their spunk, and
the game belonged to the Yellow
Jackets from then on. The loss seem-
ed to stun the Generals because they
didn’t come to play at Hampden-
Sydney. The first half was marred
by lack of desire and lack of hitting
by Washington and Lee.

The second half was diflerent,
however, as W&L began to play
as if they meant it. And they
played well. The Generals showed
in the first part of the R-MC game
and the second half of the H-SC
game that they are capable of good.
solid football. Centre College pre-
sents an excellent oppertunity for
the Generals to prove to the school
and te themselves that they can
out-hit, out-want, and out-score
a team for a full sixty minutes.

The passing attack presents a more
tangible aspect of the Washington
and Lee woe this fall. W&L foot-
ball has never been of the razzle-
dazzle type seen at other schools
They must feel that the ground
game is the safest, surest method of
moving the football. The Generals
passed quite a bit last year but even

then, did not do so wisely. In the
first place, Bill David was the man
to whom almost all of the passes
