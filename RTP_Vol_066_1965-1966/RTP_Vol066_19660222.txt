One Hunderd Chapters

Omicron Delta Kappa is an hon-
orary leadership fraternity founded
at Washington and Lee in 1914 for
the purpose of “bringing together
campus leaders in a more relaxed
atmosphere.” Dr. Rupert Latture, re-
tired political science professor, was
one of the founders. In the past
fifty years, chapters or circles have

 

been established in more than one

hundred colleges and _ universities

throughout the country.

ODK’s Purpose
ODK today is dedicated to recog-
nizing superior citizenship and lead-
ership among students, faculty,
and alumni in its chartered educa-
tional institutions. Membership in
ODK is extended only to those stu-
dents who rank in the upper 35
per cent of their class and who have
made significant contributions in
the field of scholarship, athletics,
publications, social and religious af-
fairs, speech, music, and dramatic
arts.

IFC’s Rush Book Proposal

Defeated by Large Majority
In Monday Night Meeting

By STEVE SAUNDERS
News Editor

The IFC Judical Board was hand-
ed a defeat last night when its pro-
posal for a collective rush book-
let for all fraternities was rejected
by all but four houses. Discussion of
ways to reduce the estimated $30,000
annually being spent for rush week
will continue, with the Judical Board
presenting additional recommenda-
tions at the next meeting.

Four Objectives

Billy Cannon, IFC vice president,
spoke for the Judicial Board. He
listed four objectives in rush week
reform: 1.) to reduce expenditures;
2.) to be “fair and equitable” to
every fraternity, preserving the
freedom of each; 3.) to protect the

ODK Considers
NSA And Plans
Formal Debate

By DAVE MARCHESE

Last Monday evening the ODK
Leadership Council, the executive
wing of the recently revamped ODK
Leadership Forum, met for the first
time. The Leadership Council is
composed of the officers of the ODK,
two representatives from the Execu-
tive Committee, one representative
from the IFC and the NFU as well
as the presidents from each of the
law and undergraduate classes.

Briefly, the ODK Leadership For-
um was originally constituted as a
channel of communication, a body
through which student ideas and

 

opinions may be openly and formal- |

ly expressed and debated.

Forum Functions

The Leadership Council serves as
a springboard and screening panel
for any issues which may be of con-
cern to the student body. After such
a review, the council decides wheth-
er the issue in question is worthy
of discussion and debate, and, if so,
forwards it to the Forum which is
an open meeting for students, facul-
ty, and administration.

At Monday's meeting, the Council
reviewed the recent proposal to have
W&L affiliate with the National
Student Association. The Council
decided that this would serve as an
excellent opportunity for student
debate at the first meeting of the

Forum
YAF
However. since the opposition to
NS.A. affiliation, the Young Amer-

icans for Freedom, has not been able

to attract capable speakers to debate

the N.S.A. representatives at the
Forum meeting. the Council decided
to grant the YAP. a two week ex-
tension

Thus, an arbitrary date, February
28. was set as the deadline in the
YAS efforte to arrange for a
competent speaker. With this date
established, the student body can

ook forward to a formal discussion

incoming freshmen rushees; and 4.)
to insure that the process of mutual
selection by fraternity and rushee
is safeguarded.

Cannon said that the proposed
IFC collective rush booklet would
run approximately 100 pages and
cost $2500, as opposed to the almost

$12,000 spent on individual rush
booklets by all fraternities.
Other possibilities for reducing

costs include, according to Cannon,
prohibition of serving alcoholic
beverages except during the last
two or three days of rush week; an
increase in the number of open
houses so that each rushee would be
able to see all eighteen fraternities.
These and other proposals, IFC pres-
ident Chuck Griffin announced,
would written up, sent to the fra-
ternities, and discussed next week.

Other Business

In other actions, Barry Vaught
announced that a meeting for all
fraternity treasures and presidents
will be held on Thursday night, at
7 p.m. in duPont Auditorium to dis-
cuss the proposed use of local ac-
countats to regularly audit fraterni-
ty financial records.

CONTACT ‘67

A report from CONTACT co-
chairman Phil Claxton was received,
listing the current CONTACT defi-
cit as $1150. Fraternities will be as-
sessed on a pro-rate basis, as pre-
viously agree. Non-fraternity men
will not be assessed.

Applications for chairman of the
1967 CONTACT are now being re-
ceived by the Judicial Board, and
must be submitted Sunday night to
Chuck Griffin.

By JOE WILSON
Dr. William Buchanan, chairman
of the Department of Political Sci-

ence, last night addressed a meet-
ing sponsored by the W&L Young
Democrats. The 1941 alumnus of
Washington and Lee assumed his

post as chairman at the
of this semester

Dr. Buchanan spoke on the topic,
“The Future of the Two-Party
Two-Party System.” He began the
speech by saying the topic should
be, “Your Stake as Democrats in
Preserving the GOP.”

Democrats Too Large
The speaker warned that the Dem-

beginning

ocratic Party is facing the prob-
lem of being too large. Nationally
party registration is almost two to
one, and in all levels of govern-
ment the Democrats hold over-
whelming majorities. Because of the
1964 election, the Republicans are

at their weakest since 1996. The Re-

publicans are overwhelmed by two
to one or more majorities in the
House, Senate, and Governorships

were unseated. The Dem-

lectures Tuesday and Wednesday at
Washington and Lee, under the
sponsorship of the Department of
Journalism and Communications.

He will speak on “The Historical

Alternatives Listed

Student body president Fred Min-
del began the meeting by listing th
courses of action that the EC might
take

According to Mindel the Assimila-
tion Committee could be abolished,
given fining power, or left as it is at
present.

The Executive Committee discuss-
ed the degree to which conventional
dress had been accepted by the stu-
dent body during the past year.

Situation Discussed

Joe Framptom said that most of
the freshman class conformed to the
tradition at least on the campus and
at seated meals in Commons

The Executive Committee then re-
turned to consider the effectiveness
of the Assimilation Committee over
the past year

The Assimilation Committee was
found lacking in its attention to its
duties. There were stories told of
persons who had been assimilated,
but who had never been summoned

Th imilation Committ
e Assimilation Co ee

The Executive Committee in an unusually extended session
last evening considered the question of the Assimilation Com-
mittee with particular emphasis on the future of this body. It is
extremely difficult to appreciate the comprehensiveness of the
discussion apart from actual participation. After over four hours
of conscientious and at times frustrating inquiry the Executive

Committee resolved to solicit the opinion of the student body
through a poll.

By vote of nine to one the Executive Committee de-
cided to refer the issue of the Assimilation Committee to the
student body. The purpose of this action is to ascertain the
feeling of students in regard to the possibility of abolishing
the Assimilation Committee as it is presently constituted, and
instituting a “Traditions Committee” which would be con-
cerned primarily with the proper assimilation of freshmen.
This new body would consist of a chairman appointed by the
Executive Committee and any student who indicated a desire to
participate in such a program. This realistic approach is defin-
itely challenging, while the possible rewards are particularly
desirable.

Admittedly, this conclusion appears inconsequential initial-
ly, but certainly the nature of the discussion and its implica-
tions are very pertinent. A fundamental dilemma with which
the Executive Committee is faced is whether there is, indeed,
any correlation between the existence of an Assimilation Com-
mittee and the maintenance of conventional dress. A positive
correlation is generally supported by the belief that students
adhere to conventional dress out of a fear of recrimination
from the Assimilation Committee. Although the committee's
punishment need not involve a fine or possible reprimand, the

fact of its existence personifies a moral obligation.

On the other hand a negative correlation may be easily’

demonstrated by the relatively simple argument that a tradition
is not enforceable by law. In fact, a tradition, in our context,
presupposes voluntary acceptance in order to continue its ex-
istence. The parallel which is often made with the Honor
System is valid because without the voluntary acceptance of
the responsibilities of our Honor System the entire structure
would be meaningless. The necessity of enforcing the Honor
System is a result of our belief that its maintenance is of funda-
mental significance, while enforcement of conventional dress
in this institutionalized manner is perhaps not so essential.
The Executive Committee is trying to determine if, indeed,
there is at Washington and Lee a basic commitment to the
concept of conventional dress. If this commitment, this al-
legiance is lacking, then it is quite obvious that an Assimilation
Committee of any type is inherently ineffective. We would

agree with this analysis and hasten to add, optimistically, that |

there seems to be sufficient evidence to indicate a rather strong
commitment to conventional dress. At the risk of appearing
overly idealistic, we feel that the vast majority of students per-
ceive the benefits of the custom, and are anxious to return it
to the status of a real tradition.

We want to urge students to acquaint themselves with the
position of the Executive Committee, and to consider care-
fully the programs which are forthcoming from this body.
Certainly this issue deserves more than casual attention so
often given to student polls and referendums. It provides an op-
portunity for every student to reevaluate the status of con-
ventional dress, its enforcement, and the intrinsic values which
it offers to our community. In an attempt not to circumvent
the electorate, the Executive Committee is actively soliciting
the opinions and suggestions of all. The obligation, indeed

duty , to respond is clear.

An Armed Camp?

The recent rash of attacks on W&L students prompts some
questions as to the extent to which the University views its
commitment to the doctrine of in locus parenti. Whether or not
the attacks took place on University property, the administra-
tration 1s morally, even if not legally, obligated to take some
positive action.

Bob Murray, University Proctor, appears to be the only
one concerned with the problem, or even aware of it, The at-
titude of Washington Hall seems to be one of incredible in-
difference.

Some students have already armed themselves, and others
are following suit. Before Lexington turns into an armed camp,
we hope the administration will intervene and take an interest

in these muggings

Library Liason

Contributes To The Inadequacies

By ED WOOD |
and KEN CARO |

If there is anything that a ma-|
jority of students and faculty at
Washington and Lee agree upon, it is |
that our library, to say the very |
least, leaves some things to be de-|
sired. This fact is painfully apparent
to all students attempting the most
superficial research on any subject
outside of the life and times of Rob- |
ert E. Lee. |

For Aspiring College Deans

By BRUCE RIDER

All of us know fine young men
here at Washington and Lee Univer-
sity who are planning to be lawyers
or doctors or scientists. But have you
ever met anyone who was preparing
to be a college dean or a college
president?

Of course not,

Like bus drivers and shoe sales-
men, college deans and presidents
just seem to happen into their jobs
with little formal training in what
they will actually have to do.

And this, lads is not at all as it
should be,

After all, what would college life
be without deans and college presi-
dents?

Nothing

And what is college with deans

College students would warm up
to a sports-minded president, so it
would be nice for the man enrolled
in pre-presidency to spend as much
time as possible playing, say hand-
ball. Good for you. Keeps the tummy

Embarrassing Questions

The absence of a Xerox copying
machine in the library is another
unnecessary deficiency. The Uni-
versity of Virginia has three such
machines in their library. One might
also ask why the library isn’t open
on Saturday nights or why the
Commerce Library doesn’t have a
fulltime librarian to straighten up
that mess. By the way how do you
get a book out of the Commerce
School Library? Why is the Jour-
nalism School Library always closed?

These and any number of other
criticisms can be made about our
library system. For some of them
perhaps there are valid explanations.
Yet I think the vast majority of
these deprecations are well-founded.

Orgy of Self-congratulation

situation. Surprisingly enough that

Policy Makers
Still On Spot

By NICK RUFFIN

One of the many unresolved prob-
facing

Washington and Lee
University is inte-
gration. If the
University were a
leader in educa-
tion in the South,
this issue would
have been settled
long ago. Rather
than the last, we
would have been
the first college of
consequence to in-
tegrate. But we
are not integrated,
and I know of no plans on the part
of the University to implement the
arrival of the first Negroes to our
campus.

lems

Ruffin

Eventually, the reluctant leader-
ship of the University will find the
march of events forcing it to un-
der take some hastily conceived and
clumsily executed measure (probably
to rescue a foundation grant). Wash-
ington and Lee’s policy makers,
whoever they may be, will again
be caught nude in public. They will
grasp a diminutive towel and creep
away behind a white column. This
is my impression of the handling
of the original integration statement,
and I see no indication that the next
step will be made with any greater
alacrity.

If Washington and Lee University
really wanted to be integrated, it
would be, with no reduction in the
quality of its students. The an-
nounced policy of the University to
consider all applications from quali-
fied Negro students. Presumably, any
Negro, as qualified as the average
white student accepted, would also
be accepted. But this appears to be
an unrealistic standard.

I have heard criticism of other col-
leges which maintain two sets of
admissions standards and “recruit”
Negroes. Is this reverse discrimina-
tion? An announcement by Harvard
University proves to me that such
adjustment of standards is not. Har-
vard and some enlightened institu-
tions recognize that college board
scores and high school grades, the

normal admission indices, are not
relevant in cases of underprivileged,
slum residents.

Through an intensive selection pro-
gram involving alumni, Harvard ac-
cepts students, Negro and white, who
normally would be rejected on the
basis of scores (400’s) and grades
(unaccredited schools). The results
are that eighty-five per cent of those
accepted under these standards grad-
uate. This record is only slightly (6
per cent) below that of the students
aecepted under the normal standards

The longer Washington and Lee
remains segregated, the more press-
ing our problem becomes. For Wash-
ington and Lee needs Negro students,
if it is to remain significant in the
society; but the Negro has no ap-
preciable need for Washington and
Lee. Under our “only if equal” poli-
cy, a Negro who would be accepted
her would also be accepted at many
northern colleges of equal or super-
ior reputation, with the chance of

‘Ramblings... :
: By MIKE NATION z

That big time college athletics is
professional athletics is a standing
national joke It would be better to
take it as a national disgrace.

Athletics can serve an important
role in our educational institution—
strong mind, strong body, and all
that sort of thing. There is no easier
nor more natural means of fostering
school unity and school spirit.

However, it would appear to be
difficult to have any of these feelings
for the dear old school if one real-
izes that the dear old school’s ath-
letes are not there because of any
attraction of the school—except
money. That they are there to get
an education is secondary or of no
importance.

Often times, especially in the case
of football, the athletes never be-
come a part of the student body.
They are housed in seperate dor-
mitories, variously known the
Zoo, the Animal Farm, etc.

Recruiting practices, schupulous
and unscrupulous. are legendary.
Can you imagine any school seek-
ing out academic students with the
thoroughness and expense that Vic
Bubas seeks out basketball players
for Duke?

One Wisconsin professor once sug-
gested that the school would save
time, and would be putting things
above board, if they would just
simply hired the Chicago Bears to
play for them. (Some Bears’ players
would get an increase in salary if
they did.)

Some people assert that athletic
scholarships are just another way to
get some kid an education. Baloney!
They are being paid to play athletics
and nothing more.

For example, a friend of mine had
a choice between an athletic and
academic scholarship. The athletic
one paid more, which is telling in
itself, so he took it.

This person found it necessary to
work evenings to stay in school. This
compelled him not to make several

maintain a “B”
the coach had his athletic scholar-
ship revoked.

The school refused to give him aid,
since he had “hedged” on his athletic

turn to his Negro slum and try to
accumulate enough money to go back
on campus.

This story is not at all unusual.
The athletic department demands its
money's worth. An athlete has got to
produce money at the turnstiles or
out he goes. Money and how to make
it is the governing factor in most
athletic departments.

The absurd case of this is the VMI
football team. Check this out. They
play only two games in Lexington
because they cannot draw enough
fans to support their recruiting pro-
gram. (Which has not been all that

Matmen Endure Drubbing
At Old Dominion’s Hands

By RAY ZELTNER

Well, the word for the week in
wrestling is ‘wiped.’ The job last
week against Loyola of Baltimore
seems to have been reversed. Old
Dominion defeated the wrestlers 25-
9. (Fortunately, the Junior Varsity
did not wrestle, so I am unable to add
my own infallible ability for adding
points to the opposition.)

Jim Bruton, 123 lb., lost by decision
in the first match. Rolly Jacobs, 130
lb., was pinned (one of two pins in
the entire match), and Co-captain
Kimble White lost by decision.

Payne Wins

Bobby Payne, 145 lb., earned one
of the three decisions for W&L.
Payne earned two take-downs, three
reverses, and two minutes riding
time to defeat his opponent by six
points.

Don Patterson, 152 lb., fought a
close match and lost to his oppon-
ent by one minute riding time, bring-
ing the score to 14-3, in favor of
Old Dominion.

| Saturday night Norris Eastman’s ,

red hot basketball state why did
Rupp have to go out of the state
to fill out his team? Let’s face it,
U. of K. would be just another ball
club without Louie Dampier and
Tom Kron. And unless the Ohio has
been moved one hundred miles north

ing, they are not from Kentucky.

because he was wrestling above his
usual weight class.

Clarke and Stewart Decision

Freshman Jay Clarke, 177 lb.,
brought in the second of W&L’s
decisions by defeating his opponent,
6-2. Warren Stewart, wrestling at
191 ib. (Yes, he did lose a little
weight for this one), followed suit
and also decisioned his opponent,
6-2.

Heavyweight Holmes Raker was
involved in the second pin of the
match. Unfortunately his opponent
pinned him. (It was the third period,
though; it usually happens to me in
the first.)

Well, cela suffit for this week.
If Coach Miller doesn’t have my
hide on the wall again I'll be up
at the University of Virginia next
week for our last match. (It also
happens to be Mid-Winter Weekend
at U.Va. then, so if the write-up

bad traffic.)

to go in front by as much as

<== twenty points as they coasted to their

ninth victory of
thirteen defeats.

This record represents W&L’s best
record since the 57-58 season when
its record was 21-7, and the team
had an All-American, Dom Flora.

The first half was fairly close as
Emory and Henry put up a battle.
The Generals closed with a rush to
hold a seven point lead at the inter-
mission,

Then the Generals’ offense began
to click with more efficiency and
they turned the game into a runa-
way. The Wasps could manage only
one shot at the basket as Bob Spes-
sard, Earl Edwards, and Rob Bauer
controlled the rebounds.

Rob Bauer, playing with a bad
back, scored 20 points in only three-
fourths of the game to pace the Gen-
erals in the scoring column. Big Bob
Spessard, showing a variety of shots,

the year against

ended with 8 field goals for 16
points.
Steve Sweitzer, who helped to

steady the Generals’ attack against
Emory and Henry’s press also hit
in double figures with 12 points. The
fourth Generals to finish in double
figures was John Carrere with 12
points.

With three minutes left in the
game, Bob Spessard left the Gen-
erals’ court for the last time and
90 seconds later Steve Sweitzer fol-
lowed him to the bench. Both re-
ceived a standing ovation from their
teammates and the crowd a sa tri-
bute to their credit as fine Wash-
ington and Lee basketball players.

Notes: With his 13 points against
Hampden-Sydney Wewnesday and
the 20 he scored last night Rob
Bauer finished the regular season
with 343 points in 21 games for a
16.2 average. A similar preformance
in the C.A.C. Tournament this week
would cap a great season for Bauer,
only a freshman, who has had a fine
beginning as a basketball player

...- The big “if” for W&L in the
tournament will be Frank Morrison
and how much he has recovered
from a painful thigh injury. Frank
played the last three minutes Fri-
day night although helimped a little
he made 2 of 3 shots and pulled
down a couple of rebounds.

Despite the loss of Captain Bob
Spessard and Steve Sweitzer big
things can be expected of next year’s
team. With four and the
sixth man back the young Generals
should improve on this year’s rec-
ord with a year of playing exper-
ience under their belts. And if
Coach Canfield can do as well in
recruiting this year as he did last
last year, who knows what limits
next year will hold

Washington University the
favorite in the CAC. Tournament
but W&L has been given the role
darkhorse. The Generals meet
Southwestern Thursday and if they
win, they'll play Sewanees Friday

find out just what is and what isn’t

which James MacGregor Burns
wrote on is practically dead.
Dr. Buchanan Predicts

Dr. Buchanan cautioned against
accepting political predictions, and
then made his prediction. If the
Democrats split because of their
over-extension in size, he predicted
a huge moderate party and two les-
ser parties of conservatives and lib-
eral persuasions, a new phenomenon
in the USS.

The professor declined to con-
ceive of the consequences of a three
party system in America, but re-
minded his audience that our unique
system is the substitute for political
violence which marks most world
polities.

Dr. Buchanan concluded that may-
be in “ten years from now you may
miss the Republicans very, very
badly.”

Graham Elected

Alter a short question and answer
period, Young Democrat President
Sam Frazier held a short business
meeting. To fill a vacancy, John
Graham, Delt junior from Rich-
mond, was elected by acclamation
to be First Vice President. Also all
members were invited to participate
in the Young Democratic Conven-
tion to be held in Alexandria on
March 18, 19, and 20.

The final action of the meeting
was to give Dick Israel, a second-
year law student, permission to ap-
ply for charter for a Young Dem-
ocratic club in the Law School.

For the door-to-door drive the

convenient point of departure for
alleviating the constant frustration
of search for those never-to-be-
found sources,

Another help would be to estab-
lish faculty-library rapport. The
faculty plays a large role in the
selection of the new books that are
purchased each year. Yet much of
the staff of the library seems to feel
that certain portions of the faculty
do not carry their share of the re-
sponsibility. Apparently few aca-
demic departments in the college
have failed in the past to turn in
requests for new books.

Obvious Deficiencies

Members of the faculty on the
other hand seem to regard the li-
brary staff with disdain. The impli-
cation is that the library people are
hopelessly incompetent. Certainly
there are deficiencies on both sides.
However, there seems to be little ser-
ious attempt to examine just what
deficiencies belong to whom and es-
tablish a new level of faculty-library
co-operation aimed at rectifying
these deficiencies.

 

Albert Watson

Is Speaker At
GOP Sessions

By ALAN STEDMAN

As a prelude to the coming Young
Republican State and _ Regional
Conventions, the Mary Washington
Y. R. Conference was attended by
nine delegates from the W&L YR
chapter. The two day session began
at 8 p.m. on Friday night.

Watson Speaks
Featured before delegates from
twelve Virginia colleges and several
from Pennsylvania and Washington,
D.C., was Congressman Albert Wat-
son from the 2nd district of South
Carolina, He discussed “The Facts
and Fantasy in the Republican Par-

ty and considered certain ideas
and images which, due to over-
emphasis have disgruntled some

elements of the GOP.

The concluding speech of the eve-
ning was given by the College Young
Republican National Chairman, Tom
Pauken. In the course of his dis-
cussion on “Why Youth Are At-
tracted to the Republican Party” he
outlined some of the varied roles
of Republican youth.

Vietnam Discussion

The next morning saw the dele-
gates watching a film entitled, “While
Brave Men Died,” at 9 am. This
was followed by a discussion period
under the leadership of Tom Pauken
in his other capacity of Co-Chairman
of the Committee for the Support of
Vietnam.

At 11:00 a.m., Ray Humphries, who
spoke at W&L this fall, spoke next.

After a break for lunch on Satur-
day, the rather rigorous program
continued with James Kilpatrick's
dissertation on “The View of News-
men toward the GOP!”

Prior to the last speech and ban-
quet was a discussion on “The Right
to Work Committee” which was pri-
marily concerned with 14B of the
Taft-Hartley Labor-relations Aet.
The delegates settled down at din-
net to hear Congressman Tim
Carter of Kentucky speak on our
involvment in Vietnam and other
campaign issues. Originally sehe-
duled for this concluding speech was
Thurston Morton who was unable
to attend because of a bad case of
flu

W&L representatives to the Con-
ference were YR president Roger
Wallace, Jeff Wainscott, Jim Me-
Commons, Alan Rains, Dave White,
Ed Mitchell, John Nazzaro, Art Love,
and Gavin Garrett, who is presently
State Chairman of the College Young
Republicans

Professor Of Economics
Has Article In Magazine

An article by a Washington and
Lee University economics professor
has been published in a recent edi-
tion of “Public Utilities Fortnightly.”

The article by Dr. Charles F. Phil-
lips, Jr., is entitled “Some Observa-
tions on the Federal Communications
Commission’s Telephone Investiga-
tion.”

The FCC investigation into rates
charged by the American Telephone
and Telegraph Co. for interstate and
foreign communications services will
begin in April.

Prof. Phillips’ article reviews the
background of the investigation,
summarizes the major problems faced
in the inquiry, and contains general
comments on the investigation and
the regulatory process.

Dr. Phillips is the author of a re-
cently-published textbook, “The
Economics of Regulation.” He is a
frequent contributor of articles to
economics journals and other pub-
lications and also serves as an eco-
nomic consultant to AT&T.

began to run. He ran up to the First
National Exchange Bank corner,
down to Doc’s Grill, then up past
the Student Union into the New
Dorm. Woods was chased all the way
inside the dorm, but when he came
back to the entrance, armed with a
sword, the two were gone.

Carter and Rhodes went to a pool
room where it is alleged they be-
gan insulting and harassing the
propritor. While Carter was keep-
ing the proprietor busy Rhodes tore
the telephone wire out of the wall

 

 

so he could not call the police.

Attack Near Church

After leaving the pool room, their
next victim was Bob Brenner, whom
they encountered in the Methodist
Church parking lot. They took
Brenner’s glasses, and when he re-
sisted Carer started slugging, hitting
him four or five times. Brenner ran

| to the SPE house, and called the

police. The two were finally arrest-
ed in George's, below the College
Inn, where they were trying to start
another fight.

Carter was charged on four counts
including disorderly conduct, curs-
ing and abuse of a police officer, and
two counts of assault and battery.
Rhodes was charged with destroying

j private property, assault and bat-

tery, and stealing a hat. More
charges will probably be made at a
later date. Both men were released
on bond pending trial on March 8 at
9 a.m.

When asked about the incident,
Bob Murray siad, “W‘e’re going to
throw the book at these two and
show all of them that they can’t
get away with this kind of thing. It’s
the only awy to stop it.”

 

Briggs Looks Upon Bogart
As Star of Bad Movies

(Continued from page 2)

thing is, they aren’t spoofs. They're
the real phony thing.

Final proof of our love of bad
films, if proof were needed, is that
rarely will a french critic or the
Harvard film society praise or men-
tion Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs in
“Treasurer of the Sierra Madre” or
as Mr. Allnut in “The African
Queen,” where he was at the height
of his powers and with material that
enhanced him as much as he en-
hanced it. Here he was not beating
the system but contributing to it.
Such misplaced appreciation of the
man and actor, one cannot help
saying, is a little bogus. If, however,
our gangster and soldier of fortune
movies have been vied with amused
indulgence by the French, if they
have loved their charming vulgar-
ity and even taken it more seriously
than we have on occasion, they
have also raised it to the level of
art in such films as Godard’s
“Breathless.” Next time I shall take
up Belmondo as the “new” Bogart.

college life to be a martyr at Wash-
ington and Lee. To be the first Negro
student here would be symbolic of
nothing. A Negro who comes to
Washington and Lee will be coming
because he wants to come, because
he sees educational opportunities and
a way of life superior to those
available to him at other colleges.
The social opportunities provided for
the Negro student appear inadequate,
if not intolerable.

I do not mean to be too pessim-
istic, for I think many students
would offer genuine response to the
situation; but the social hierarchy is
such that it would defeat their best
efforts. The dorm life, inadequate,
and the fraternities, with their chart-
ers and ball-systems, would negate
the students’ efforts to bring a
Negro into our community,

Washington and Lee must seek
Negro students, and it must prepare
the way for them as best it can. The
responsibility is shared by the trus-
tees, alumni, administration, faculty
and students.

THE MODS OF LONDON have been responsible for nurturing

some of the most radical and exciting fashion ideas in recent

memory. At the outset, however,

let’s make it clear that virtually

none of these fashions are presently being worn on American
campuses, Yet in fashion as in everything else, from extremes
emerge the means, and there’s no doubt that modified versions of
many of these innovations will catch on and be counted among the
best college market sellers in the near future. In any case, we
thought you'd be interested in hearing about what's happening
right now on the London fashion scene, as well as what's being

done in Mod fashions in America.

“SEE YOU IN CARNABY” is the in-phrase among London's way-

out swingers these days. Almost overnight, Carnaby Street, located
in London's fashionable West End, has become the center and the
source of what the Mods refer to as their “instant fashions.” It's
an amusing paradox that Carnaby is located a mere 200 yards from
Savile Row, long recognized as headquarters for London's most
distinguished and conservative tailoring establishments. Who
shops Carnaby? Only the Dave Clark Five, The Rolling Stones, The
Animals, four young men named John, George, Paul and Ringo,
and a fifth who used to be known around town as Anthony Arm-

strong-Jones. And what do they,

and thousands of their fans and

followers, buy there? Some pretty surprising fashions . .,

THE MOD TUXEDO, for a start, offers plenty

of surprises. Cut tight and skinny, it features
a3 or 4-button jacket, high, narrow lapels, \ ery
deep side vents, satin belt loops, cuffs, and a
wide satin belt. The trousers are tapered in
extremis, and the outfit may be worn with black
demi-boots. Accessories are radical, if not out.

THE MOD MODE, in all apparel areas, is char-

robe is form-fitted, and anything smacking of
standardized fashions is “automatically out,”
The plumage on the male bird is getting
brighter and snappier, and there’s no doubt that
it's getting harder all the time to tell the boys
apart from the girls. Prices are comparatively
high: slacks run anywhere from $15. to $25.
we frequently find strong surface interest in a

rich variety of textured fabrics. In slacks, the low-rise, hip-hugging

model is in. Belts

MODISM MOVES ON: here are some more “musts” in the fashion-

conscious Mod's wardrobe, A camel suede overshirt with seamed
pockets and shoulders, usually worn with slacks tapered to the knee,
then flared out to bell bottom cuffs. A pair of giant black-and-white
houndstooth check trousers, worn as low as possible. Ticking-
striped low-rise jeans worn with a matching snap-front jacket,
A rugged blue denim shirt with a high-rise collar and cuffs of white
broadcloth. A fancy soft leather vest. The Mod Suit which doubles

prints and even wilder color ideas. Take, for
example, the black daisy shirt, a lightweight
cotton print that also comes in red, purple

trip to London, I was assured that it's one of
the current best-sellers! And it’s now being sold

in a few shops across America,
