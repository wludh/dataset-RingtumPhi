noon and a party in Roanoke that
night. Those to be initiated are
freshmen Tommy Brickhouse, Alan
Lee, Bob Price, Tommy Rueger, Ken

McClure, John Meinrath, Bill Put-
ney, Roddie Roediger, Pev Settle,
Alan Stedman, Tom Slabaugh, and
Addison Graves (Joe) Wilson, and
sophomore Corky Nicholson.

The 124 freshmen actives from
twelve houses is two less than the
the 126 from eleven houses at the
same time a year ago.

Grade Trouble for 39
Thirty-nine freshmen from these

 

houses failed to meet the 1.00 grade
point ratio requirement by the Uni-
versity and fell into the “super
pledge” category.

These “super pledges” are not rec-
ognized by the national fraternity,
but they can be initiated if they
make a 1.50 at mid-semester.

Delts, Nus Successful

The Delts and the Sigma Nus had
the most success in getting pledges
to meet the grade requirement. Only
1 of 15 Delts and 2 of 18 Sigma Nus
didn’t measure up.

The 17 freshmen to be initiated by
Phi Ep represents the largest number
of freshmen to go active since 1963
when the Delts initiated 18.

Delta Upsilon, Kappa Alpha, Phi
Gam, and Phi Psis plan their initia-
tion ceremonies by the end of the
month, but only Phi Psi has set a
definite date, Feb. 19. KA hopes to
hold its initiation the wekend of
Feb. 26, but the date is not definite.
Phi Psi will have a cocktail party
in addition to the customary ban-
quet.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che King-tum Phi

Tuesday Edition

Bell, Book, And Candle

Tomorrow afternoon faculty and students will be given
an opportunity to participate in a discussion on the progress
of the Self-Study on the library. During the course of this
year we have been extremely interested in the evaluation of
our library primarily because we feel that the library is the
heart of this University. In light of the rather poor attendance
at certain other meetings concerning various aspects of the
Self-Study, particularly by students, we wish to urge faculty
and students alike to support Wednesday’s hearing enthusiastic-
ally.

 

Conflicting Interests

The Ring-tum Phi has taken a very keen interest in the
deliberations of the library committee, and we have discovered,
on occasion, dissension within this committee which necessarily
prohibited a full and dispassionate appraisal of the library’s
needs. On the other hand we noted with encouragement the
circulation of a questionnaire seeking faculty reaction to ques-
tions concerning library space, holdings, policies, and services.
We are anxiously awaiting the publication of any data related
to this survey.

Obvious Omissions

A close examination of the library summary reveals sev-
eral obvious omissions. The number and quality of volumes
presently in our library receives no attention, although we are
willing to admit that these statistics are by no means an ade-
quate measure of the excellence of our library. Nevertheless,
quantity and quality are significant aspects of the overall con-
tent of any library.

Recommendations concerning periodicals are also lacking
in the abbreviated report. The lacunae in our periodical col-
lection are the source of frustration and consternation for the
student engaged in research. Although the library is perhaps
hopelessly behind in the acquisition of scholarly journals, we
believe that some progress can and should be made in this area.

Faculty Status and Tenure?

Faculty status and eventually tenure for all professional
personnel beyond the second year of service is probably the
most surprising recommendation contained in the summary.
This statement is somewhat ambigious since there is no indica-
tion of the educational prerequisite for professional personnel.
We are opposed to tenure for library personnel based on length
of service alone. In addition, faculty status should be reserved
for the teaching and administrative members of the academic
community.

It is unfortunate that the study of the library became a
forum for venting of personal differences which on numerous
occasions thwarted the real purpose of the Self-Study. There
is, however, ample opportunity for students and faculty to
contribute meaningfully to this discussion at tomorrow's meet-
ing.

We would suggest that students familiarize themselves with
the content of the committee’s summary in order to prepare
for this important session. Copies of the report are available
in Mr. Parsons’ office on the third floor of Washington Hall.

CONTACT: A Second Chance

Except for one session of the 1965 CONTACT, participa
tion by the student body was appallingly law. Dr. James W.
Silver attracted a full-house, while the five other speakers ex-
erted themselves for the handful of persons who attended their
speeches. It was a sad commentary on both the principle of

CONTACT and the Washington and Lee Student body.
Last Year's Disappointment

The diffuse nature of last year’s theme, a nebulous and
ambiguous potpourri called “The American Experience and
Its Applications for the Individual Citizen, the American Na-
tion and the World,” was in part responsible for the uninspired
response of the students. However, this does not reduce the
blame which must be heaped on the student body as a whole.
If only out of common courtesy, for the speakers, the seats in
Lee Chapel should have been filled. If only to make use of the
money which each fraternity had to pay, the seats should have
been filled. If only to give support to a fragile but valuable
project, those seats should have been filled.

Maturation Process
CONTACT is a year older, and—hopefully—a year bet-

ter. Whether or not it has matured will be determined this
weekend on the Lee Chapel podium; whether or not the stu-
dent body has matured equally will be decided by the number
of empty seats. We think there has been maturation of both
CONTACT and the Student Body. Hopefully, many filled

seats will prove us right.

End of The IFC “Jewish List” Is Discussed

By BOB LEE

This past Tueday night, the LF.C.
was subjected to one of the most
thoroughly revolting exhibitions I
have ever witnessed. At its weekly
meeting, the ILF.C.’s_ enlightened
leadership urged its member frater-
nities to vote for the elimination of
dual lists of incoming freshmen, from
which Jewish students can be dis-
tinguished from non-Jewish stud-
ents. This represents a significant im-
provement—I wouldn’t presume to
argue otherwise—but the sincerity
with which the appeals were made
must appear somewhat suspect. Less
than one year ago, the President of
the LF.C., in defending the dual
lists, wrote the following:

Moreover, I would like to point
out that the LF.C. is not condon-
ing the perpetuation of ‘an intol-
erably hypocritical system of dis-
crimination’... Rather, it is acting
in accordance with the wishes of
a majority of the fraternities—I
believe this is called democracy. ...

It becomes a matter of which
party we chose to hurt? If we
publish a single list of the entire
freshman class, we will be doing
an injustice to those houses whose
hands are bound by such restric-
tive clauses.

Is this the same Chuck Griffin I
heard Tuesday night argue in such
eloquent and vaunted platitudes
about the injustice of seperate lists?
How times have changed!!!!

 

 

Where did all the help go?

Tuesday night we were told how
we were contributing to the violation
of the law. I would suggest that
there is a higher moral law which
was not legislated or adjudicated
just last year, but one which has
been recognized and generally ac-
cepted for a long time. Suddenly the
LF.C. has become conscious of and
concerned about the prospect of
breaking the law. Where were these
scrupples in the past when the LF.C.
blatantly broke overy moral precept
concerning discrimination? Is_ it
simply that this moral law went un-
perceived by a majority of fraterni-
ties at Washington and Lee?

How Times Have Changed

We also heard from a representa-
tive of the Administration who con-
demned not only dual lists, but the
whole concept of restrictive clauses.
He told us that it was not the Ad-
ministration nor the Admission’s Of-
fice who were responsible for the
way in which these lists had been
used in the past. The list, he said,
were drawn up simply for the con-
venience of local churches and syna-
gogues. Thus the Administration, we
are to assume, could not accept re-
sponsibility for the discrimination
arising from the publication of sep-
arate lists.

Now this is just a little hard to
swallow. If they were drawn up
simply to benefit the local ministers
and rabbis, why were they ever
made available to rush chairmen

who could use them to exclude an
otherwise anonymous group of stu-
dents from their respective fraterni-
ties. No—the Administration and Of-
fice of Admissions are more respon-
sible for whatever discrimination has
taken place than anyone else. It
has been they who over the years
divulged information, ostensibly giv-
en them in confidence, to facilitate
the discriminatory practices of cer-
tain fraternities.

They were never compelled to
comply with the wishes of the LF.C.
If they found such discrimination to
be undesirable, why did they permit
such information to be used in ways
obviously intended to promote and
foster discrimination. The Adminis-
tration and the Office of Admissions
cannot be absolved from guilt in this
matter.

So what can and ought to be done?
How can Washington and Lee simply
permit itself to be carried along in
the current sweeping American col-
lege campuses, but become a leader
in eliminating this morally regret-
table practice of discrimination by

 

fraternities? How can we now stop
paying lip service to the idea of an
“open rush system” and insure the
implementation of such a program?
Washington and Lee cannot remain
content to observe standards set by
“national fraternities,” but ought to
set their own standards to which
the nationals must conform.

We ought to insist that any frater-
nity whose national retains such a
restrictive clause must, in order to
demonstrate good faith, repudiate
such a clause or at least make a
statement that the local chapter
chooses to ignore all such clauses.
The LF.C. should likewise guaran-
tee that all channels by which fra-
ternities can ascertain the religious
affiliations of freshmen be closed
to them.

They should also bring pressure to
bear against those fraternities who
continually maintain their all-Chris-
tian composition. Lastly. the LF.C.
ought to provide leadership whose
pronouncements on the subject do
not reek of hypocrisy.

 

Nation Solicits Support
For Contact Symposium

ByMIKE NATION

The most exciting innovation at
Washington and Lee during this
columnist’s three years tenure was
the birth last year of CONTACT.

CONTACT, as conceived, is to be
an annual, except for mock conven-
tion year, intellec-
tual symposium
covering one spe-
cific topic of cur-
rent interest and
importance. Last
year’s topic was
“The American
Experience.” This
year “The City”
will be the sub-
ject for discussion.

The modern
city, the enormous
and nearly formless conglomeration
of humans in a limited area, is the
newest of all people distribution phe-
nomena. The Industrial Revolution
itself did not give rise to the city
as we know it today. It did give rise
to large masses residing in the same
area. But these groups centered
about an industry or some other eco-
nomic support had a sense of oneness
and community in the various in-
dividuals’ equal statuses and com-
mon dependence on that source of
support.

Rather it was Henry Ford who
gave us mass transportation that
gave birth to the huge city. The
mobility of individuals allowed them
to move away from their source of
economic support. Now the city
grows crazily with little sense of
pattern. People move frequently.
They have no roots, no home. Immi-
grants, both from without of the
country and minorities within, are
forced into the decayed parts of the
city, inte a community which is not

 

a community, searching for a mean-
ing or truth of life which may not be
there, abandoned by the churches
and other social institutions which
follow the middle class to the sub-
urbs, and, in summation, possessed
truly by the existential loneliness
that is characteristic of our age.
Can the City Survive

The lower class is but one, though
one of the largest, aspects of the
crisis we face with this new soci-
ological form, mass population. They
are part of an overriding question:
Can and should the city survive as
a social institution?

A social institution should provide
something of mutual benefit for the
individuals involved in it. Is the mass
city capable of giving its residents
any benefits? Do such benefits have
the greater value needed to counter-
act the drawbacks? Is there a danger
of the pendulum swinging the other
way from under socialization to
over-socialization? In all, in what
form should our population be dis-
tributed for the good of the com-
munity and the good of the individ-
ual?

A Most Important Problem

That this CONTACT weekend will
serve for arrival at a universally cor-
rect answer for all these questions is
doubtful. However, every person
owes it to himself and his community
to become well-informed, to become
involved in this problem, the most
important problem in our country
today, and in time to come and after
the question of birth rate, the most
important problem of the world.

It is hoped that all W&L men
will take advantage of this week-
end and hear all six speakers. Al-
though each seperate program is an
entity in itself, together they form
a valuable unity.

Professors Not Maintaining
Theory Of Unlimited Cuts

By ROY TYLER

The “new” cut system at Washing-
ton and Lee has produced a paradox
which has caused a great deal of
misunderstanding between faculty
and students.

Perhaps I am mistaken, but I
thought the term “unlimited cuts”
meant just that that cuts would
not be limited except before and
after holidays. Some professors, how-
ever, have begun a concentrated
campaign against the use of class
cuts, even though the student body
has been granted the privilege of
unlimited unexcused abscences

Seating Charts

Professors who make out
roles, assign seats, and make ridicu-
lous “seating charts” are, in effect,
denying the students in their classes
the privileges granted them by the
administration. In the light of the
new cut system, this type of proce-
dure is beth unwarranted and un-

clas ’

fais
lt is unwarranted because the fae-
ulty does not make attendance policy

 

ilege to have unlimited class cuts
only to immediately have this priv-
ilege denied them by individual pro-
fessors who think they should de-
termine university policy.
Destroy System
These professors believe they
should decide what the policy for
class attendance in their class should
be, but in this manner of thinking
they are destroying all the benefits
of the new system
The professors who deny their stu-
dents the privilege of unlimited cuts
are also being unfair, for they are,
in effect, saying that student No. 1

and student No. 2 should suffer
equally for four unexcused absences
Student No. 1, however, might be
able to take twice as many cuts as
student No, 2, and still maintain the
same quality of work

A professor who makes each stu-
dent suffer in direct proportion to
the number of classes that he cuts is

actually saying that class cutting is

more important than quality of work

Practice and Theory

nor does the faculty decide what the| This not the case under the

Cagers Down Towson;
Spessard Back In Action

Washington and Lee’s basketball team split a pair of games
this past weekend. Friday night the Generals defeated Tow-
son College, 80-70. A first half spurt gave them a 46-39 lead

at intermission. Outscoring their opponents by 3 in the second

half, the Generals played an excellent game to notch their sixth
bs

victory of the season.

Spessard Shines

Rob Bauer led the Generals scor-
ing attack with 21 points, also mak-
ing him high scorer for the game.
Frank Morrison with 17, Bob Spes-
sard with 15, and John Carrere with
12 gave the Generals four men in
double figures. The most heartening
sight of the evening to Coach Can-
field was the return to early season
form by Spessard. Besides his 15
points, he hauled down 14 rebounds,
a game high for him this season.

Randolph-Macon came to Lexing-
ton Saturday night sporting a 12-4
record overall and 7-1 against state
competition. Heavily favored against
the Generals, the Yellow Jackets
were given a big scare before win-
ning by a four point margin, 77-73.

W&L Takes Lead

Washington and Lee jumped off to
a quick lead and was still ahead
25-20 with seven minutes left in the
first half. Then Randolph-Macon
got its fast break working, ripped
off 13 points while limiting the Gen-
erals to 8, and led 38-33 at the half.

Randolph-Macon increased its lead
to as much as twelve early in the
second half, but the Generals re-
fused to quit. Chipping away at the
Yellow Jackets, the Generals tied
the game on two free throws by
Rob Bauer with five minutes left in
the game. At this point Randolph-
Macon spurted to a 74-66 lead with
two minutes left. Still not Beaten
W&L clased the gap to 76-73 with 30
seconds left. The Yellow Jackets
added their last point on a foul shot
as the Generals were forced to foul
in their attempts to get the ball.
Spessard’s shot at the buzzer bounced

 

away thus leaving W&L the van-
quished by four bitter points

High scorer of the game was Frank
Morrison with 22 points, 13 coming
in the first half. Bauer and Earl Ed-
wards each scored 11 points. Ran-
dolph-Macon did not convert a free
throw in the first half as they had
only two chances. But it was their
15 free throws in the second half
which helped to hand W&L its 11th
defeat in 17 games. A hard loss for
the Generals, but one which showed
a vastly improved team which can
look more optimistically at the re-
mainder of its schedule.

Carpenter Reviews Prospects For Atlanta Falcons

Next week the
League will stock the new Atlanta
Falcons with three veteran players
from each of the 14 existing clubs.
Each of the teams will submit a

drafted from the Cleveland Browns.

time. Tubbs was a part time starter
for the 49ers. He insisted that he

Summer Geology Institute
Planned For Teachers
In Secondary Schools

The W&L Geology Department,
supported by the National Science
Foundation, has established a Sum-
mer Institute in Geology for secon-
dary school science teachers. Begin-
ning on June 20, about thirty high
school science and mathematics
teachers will attend classes in Howe
Hall and participate in field trips
through the Virginia Appalachians.
The Institute will be directed by Dr.
Odell S. McGuire, with the aid of
Dr. Samuel J. Kozak.

The Geology Institute was called
into being by the rapidly increasing
demand for earth science teachers in
the secondary schools of the eastern
seaboard. School in this area have
been turning to earth science as a
standard 9th grade course, relegating
the older “general science” courses
to the 7th and 8th grades. At the

Proposal Is Made At Meeting
To Increase Scope Of Booklet

By JOHN LEE
At last night’s IFC meeting, main
topics discussed were the IFC-spon-
sored CONTACT symposium to be
held this weekend and resolutions
concerning election of fraternity of-
ficers.

Phil Claxton, one of CONTACT’s

co-chairmen, announced that the
CONTACT brochures have _ been

printed and will be distributed this
week. Beginning Thursday at 4 p.m.,
and ending after the last meeting
Saturday evening, CONTCT plans a
real involvement with the problems
of “The City.”

Virginia schools of the area have
been well-informed about CON-
TACT,, and contingents from many
colleges are expected. IFC buses will
run this weekend, possibly at re-
duced rates, to accommodate the an-
ticipated turnout.

Claxton also announced that the
positions in the individual speaker’s
seminars are open for Thursday and
Friday. Anyone who desires to at-
tend a seminar should contact Roger
Sennott at 463-5453 for further in-
formation.

In order to facilitate a more effi-
cient committee system within the
IFC itself, and to enable house treas-
urers to carry out their duties with
greater accuracy, a proposal was dis-
cussed to elect fraternityPresidents
and Treasurers before the second
IFC meeting in February of each
year. Houses with national frater-
nity rules concerning election of of-
ficers would be exempt.

Also dealing with financial oper-
ations of the fraternities, Billy Can-
non introduced the possibility of the
IFC employing a CPA to oversee all
fraternity aoosUntng. In _this way,

Contact Plans

(Continued from page 1)

at 8 p.m

All addresses will be held in Lee
Chapel and are open to the public.

A panel discussion among the
Speaker and students and faculty
members will follow each talk.
Questions from the audience will
then be heard
“The purpose of CONTACT is two-
fold.” Claxton, “first, to get
good quality speakers here to dis-
cuss current problems, and secondly
to interest students in learning more
ibout the problems of the day.”

The first CONTACT program was
held last March when six speakers
discussed “The American Experi-
ence and Its Applications for the
Individual Citizen, the American Na-
tion and the World.”

idea and will investigate such a pos-
sibility further.

Smashed Skull Is Found
Near Old Freshman Dorm
By Terrified Freshmen

(Continued from page 1)
Identification in these cases, ac-
cording to Dr. Brockebough, is based
on the condition of the crainum it-
self, the teeth, and “other consider-
ations.” The name of the deceased is
almost impossible to determine with
any surety, he said, but there is a
record of Margaret Garrett, a
kitchen slave, who was murdered by
her husband in a drunken rage with
an iron pot handle on April 16,
1824.

Margaret Garrett was the property
of Jeremy Lyles Houston, and is
listed as buried in the family plot.

Only if further remains are dis-
covered, Dr. Brockebough said, will
this theory be corroborated. “There
were hundreds of burials made on
that land, which was over two acres
altogether,” observed Dr. Brocke-
bough, “and further evidence should
come to light soon, if it is the old
graveyard.” Brockebough also noted
that if it was the old Brockebough-
Houston-Campbell cemetery behind
the Co-op, the University might have
to repurchase the land from the des-
cendents of the families, in the ab-
sence of any original quitclaim deeds
to the grave sites. He called it a
remote but “intriguing” possibility.

Dr. Brockebough is 74
age, and has been retired
years.

Increased Financial Aid
Announced By Dean John
For the 1965-66 Session

The amount of financial aid Wash-
ington and Lee University awards
undergraduates has reached a rec-
ord $249,750, an increase of 15 per
cent over last year.

Dean Lewis G. John, director of
student financial aid, reports that
260 students are receiving that
amount. In addition, another 37 stu-
dents in the Washington and Lee
School of Law are receiving a total
of $24,915.

This is the highest amount the
university has awarded since it be-
gan an expanded financial program
five years ago. The program’s pur-
pose is to make the opportunity for
a Washington and Lee education
available to all qualified high school
students, regardless of individual
financial circumstances.

By comparison, the university
awarded $44,970 in the 1954-55 aca-
demic year. In 1960-61, the first year
of the new program, $154,119 was
awarded to 200 students.

The aid takes the form of grants,
loans and jobs, with some a combi-
nation of one or more. Most of the
recipients are under the grant-loan,
program.

The highest award, a combination
scholarship and job, is $2,500 this
year. Scholarship grants range from
$100 to $2,000.

While the aid this year has in-
creased 15 per cent overall, the as-
sistance to freshman is up more than
35 per cent, Dean John reports.
Seventy-six of the 347 entering
freshmen were awarded $87,000.

Several Delegate positions are still

Chaffin’s Debate Team
Stretch Undefeated String
In Cambridge Tournament

The Washington and Lee debate
team extended its string of unde-
feated tournaments last weekend at
Harvard College in Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts. Senior David Marchese,
speaking in the extemporaneous di-
vision, combined with sophomore de-
baters Hal Higginbotham and Tom
Baremore to give the W&L team a
record of four wins and four losses
in the tournament.

University of Richmond

This coming weekend, another
team of Washington and Lee debaters
will visit the University of Rich-
mond to compete in a varsity and
novice tournament. Debating for the
varsity team will be John McMurray
and Chris Mills. Harry Zeliff and
Kirk Woodward will represent
Washington and Lee in the novice
division.

Future Plans

Future plans for Dr. Chaffin’s de-
baters include a possible trip to
Dartmouth College on February 19.

The Washington and Lee Debate
team has one of the most successful
records in recent years thus far. The
team has a particularly strong fresh-
man group which insures a continu-
ation of the outstanding seasons of
recent years.

NSA Question

In addition to the intercollegiate
events Mr. Chaffin sponsors several
debates within the University com-
munity on topics of general interest.
He is expected to provide a forum
for the upcoming debate on the NSA
question. Interested students are
urged to contact him in regard to
the arrangements for this event.

Carpenter Asks NFL Questions

(Continued from page 3)

Alderman, an All-Pro offensive
tackle, was drafted from the Detroit
Lions after only one year in the
NFL. The other 35 draftees have
gone elsewhere.

The American League was much
more liberal in stocking the new
Miami Dolphins. Each team submit-
ted a list of 13 expendables from
which four were to be selected. The
Dolphins picked several players who
were part time starters during this
past season. Their system amounted
to allowing the clubs to protect their
first units plus one other man, which
in most cases would have been a
kicking specialist. Thus, the Dolphins
had a good chance at some slipping
veterans and rising youngsters. They
selected a nucleus of a good Ameri-
can League Team.

National League

Why couldn’t the NFL give its
new club a chance to come into the
league on an even scale with some
of the weaker clubs? If the National
League teams had been forced to

present time, there is an extreme
shortage of qualified earth science
teachers available to secondary
schools.

The National Science Foundation
has contributed $31,000 to W&lL’s
institute, making it the 39th summer
institute to begin training teachers
in earth science—more than in either
physics or chemistry.

The students attending the insti-
tute will spend six weeks at W&L,
using the university’s dormitory,
dining, and _ infirmary facilities.
Through a program of lectures, dis-
cussions, laboratory study, assigned
reading, and field excursions,
teachers will be given a basic and
practical understanding of the field of
geology.

the Falcons might have come up
with a team that could handle half
of the present clubs with a break or
two. As it is, it is safe to assume
that if the Falcons come within a
touchdown of anybody they will be
fortunate.

Seven Questions

Do you know anything about the
National Football League and _ its
players? Just for kicks see if you
can aswer the following seven ques-
tions.

Where did Gino Marchetti go to
college, and who was his coach
there?

In 1963 Arizona State had a fantas-
tic running backfield of Charlie Tay-
lof, Henry Carr, and Tony Lorick.
The quarterback is now a member
of a NFL taxi squad. Who is that
quarterback?

What is Chuck Bednarik’s alma
mater?

Who is the only player in the NFL
from South Dakota State?

Rudy Bukich, the quarterback for
the Chicago Bears, played for three
other teams in the NFL. Can you
name them?

Can you name the All-Pro defen-
sive cornerback of last season who
never played college football? He
was seen in the Pro Bowl this year.
He played basketball, and his broth-
er played for the Red Sox.

What NFL star today scored the
touchdown that broke the Nation’s
longest college football winning
streak in history?
