By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Last Monday’s faculty recommen-
dation that University funds be
withdrawn from the Southern Col-
legian has raised strong objections
from several student groups, notably
the Executive Committee and the
Publications Board. Under the pres-
ent constitutional arrangements,
faculty recommendation is  tanta-
mount to legislative, and it is almost
certain that the administration will
agree to curtail Southern Collegian
funds for next year.

The faculty decision was made as
a result of the Self-study Commit-
tee’s report on the Southern Col-
legian which asserted that the cen-
tury-old magazine is in poor taste
serves no useful educational pur-
pose, and is an embarrassment to the
University. About half of the Col-

legian’s $3,000 publication costs cur-
rently come from University activity
funds.

The student Executive Committee
and the Publications Board have both
drawn up resolutions to President
Cole to delay final decisions until
student opinion can be expressed.
Their objections to the faculty de-
cision are based on the dubious
manner of the proceeding against
the Collegian: It has been revealed
that:

(1) Last fall, Dean Edward Atwood
and Mr. Frank Parsons privately
requested that the Wé&L print shop
refuse to print the Collegian, Later,
when Collegian editor Jim Crothers
went to the print shop to make ar-
rangements concerning the publica-
tion, he was informed, much to his
surprise, that the W&L shop would

 

not print the magazine. Crothers
was consequently forced to print the
Collegian in Staunton.

(2) For registration, the old
“Student Activities Fee’ has been
lumped into an overall tuition fee.
This has had the effect of transfer-
ring financial responsibility for stu-
dent activities from the students to
the administration.

(3) The Self-study Committee
made no mention of the Southern
Collegian in its report earlier in the
year. When students asked to dis-
cuss the Collegian with the commit-
tee, they were told that the com-
mittee was not prepared to discuss
the magazine.

(4) No members of the Publica-
tions Board or any other students
were invited to participate in the

Self-study Committee, nor was any
student group asked to present a
defense of the Collegian.

(5) On February 10, the Publica-
tions Board voted to hold a faculty-
student discussion on the Southern
Collegian, but the faculty’s decision
on Monday effectively cut out such
discussion.

(6) The Publications Board was in
the process of taking a poll to be
presented to the Self-study Com-
mittee on Tuesday, but the poll was
undercut by the Monday vote of the
faculty. The poll revealed that 99
percent of the student body reads
the Southern Collegian, that 94 per-
cent approves of it, and that 78 per-
cent of the students’ parents ap-
prove of the magazine.

In an interview, Publications Board
President Drew Baur stated that

 

 

the actions taken by the administra-
tion and faculty were unknown to
the students until the faculty vote
on Monday was already an accom-
plished fact. Baur pointed out that
the Southern Collegian is part of the
student constitution, and that its
probable elimination by the above
methods means that similar alter-
ation of any part of the constitution
is a possibility. Baur particularly ob-
jected to the refusal of the Self-
study Committee to discuss the Col-
legian with students and to the
secretive nature of the administra-
tion and faculty proceedings, es-
pecially when the Publications Board
“fully intended to meet the South-
ern Collegian issue this year.”

The faculty decision came as a
complete surprise to the Publica-
tions Board, which had actually met

Che KRing-tum Phi

Washington and Lee Semi-Weekly Newspaper

on Tuesday with announced inten-
tion of discussing the Collegian on
that day. The surprise announce-
ment caused great indignation among
student board members, and hot
words ensued between student mem-
bers and the Dean of Students.

The spring edition of the Southern
Collegian, printed in Staunton, will
be the last issue financed by W&L
activities funds, and possibly the
last ever. The faculty decision does
not go into effect until next year.

There is some possibility that the
Southern Collegian can continue
publication next year through sub-
scription. Furthermore, the Collegian
editor and business manager may
still sit on the Publications Board,
even though their magazine will no
longer be an official W&L publica-
tion.

Students Ask
Step-up In

I ntegration

Monday night, March 7, in the
lounge of the Student Union, ap-
proximately twenty-five students in-
terested in the welfare of Washing-
ton and Lee were called together by
Fred Mindel, President of the Stu-
dent Government. The purpose of
this meeting was to discuss ways by
which the students could aid the
administration and admisisons com-
mittee in hastening the integration
of the university.

The members of this group felt
that in order for Washington and

Lee to remain a leader in the field
of education, it is necessary to accept
qualified Negroes into the student
body as soon as possible. They also
added that the educational process
of the school is badly restricted
without the presence of Negroes at
an institution of such high caliber
and esteem. Thus the group pro-
posed three plans which would aid
the administration in attaining this
goal.

1. Sponsor a fund drive among
the students, faculty and possibly
outside sources. The proceeds from
this drive could be used to estab-
lish a Negro scholarship fund or
could be given to the admissions
department to help further the
recruitment of Negroes.

2. Look into the possibility of
having a Negro in some of our ex-
change programs. It was cited that
other Southern universities have
found this an effective means of
futhering their own integration

Students aid the admissions com-
mittee in interviewing qualified
Negroes, familiarizing them with
WA&L and encouraging them to ap-
ply here.

James Farrar, Dean of Admissions,
told Mindel that a responsible pro-
gram initiated by the students with
regard to the fund drive and inter-
views would be, he felt certain, not

Ah, March. The month when a young man’s fancy turns, apparently,

to thoughts of what's wrong with W&L. Last year it was the Charlie
Milne case. This year, according to the group with the placard at the right,
it’s the injustice of a penalty for violating conventional dress, The rest
of the student body will make its opinions known in a referendum Mon-
day. Funny thing, though: everybody in this picture seems to be in coat

and tie.

Executive Committee set final plans
for the Assimilation Committee Poll,
discussed the faculty withdrawal of
funds for the Southern Collegian,
heard a request from junior Jim
Awad for an Independent Study Pro-
gram, settled the Mickey Isikoff case,
and voted down N.S.A.

The Assimilation Committee poll
will be held on Monday, March 14,
with polling boxes located in front
of and behind Washington Hall, in
the Law School, and in the Com-
mons. The student body is to be
offered three choices in the poll:
(1) Retain the Assimilation Com-
mittee as it is now, (2) Re-establish
the fining power of the Assimila-
tion Committee, and (3) abolish the
Assimilation Committee.

The official status of the vote is
to be that of an opinion poll, and
the Executive Committee will make
the final decision regarding the fu-
ture status of the Assimilation Com-
mittee. Nevertheless, the EC will
probably follow the wishes of the
student body, as expressed in the
poll.

activities funds from the Southern
Collegian, most of the EC members
expressed indignation. President
Fred Mindel concluded that “essen-
tially, the faculty has altered our
constitution without consulting us.”

A resolution on the faculty action
was drawn up and passed with only
one absentation. The resolution ex-
pressed the belief of the Executive
Committee that in making their de-
cision, the faculty ignored student
opinion and wishes and repeatedly
ignored student attempts to bring
the Southern Collegian up for stu-
dent-faculty discussion. The resolu-
tion, addressed to President Cole,
asked that the issue be resubmitted
to the Self-study Committee so that
students could express their views.

Independent Study Plan

The EC listened to a request from
Jim Awad that an Independent
Study Plan be adopted for W&L.
Under Awad’s plan, (1) first semes-

President Mindel announced that

the appeal. The EC voted down a

They ll Walk All Over You

You keep playing where you shouldn’t be playing; and
you think that you'll never get burned, ha! I Just
found a brand new box of matches, yeah. And what we
know you ain’t had time to learn. These boots are
made for walking and that’s just what they'll do; one
of these days these boots will walk all over you. Are
you ready boots, start walking ....

 

The lyrics to Nancy Sinatra’s “Boots” probably best ex-
press the way Washington and Lee’s Administration handled
the banning of the Southern Collegian. Cloaked under the
pretense of a self-study recommendation, Washington Hall has
seemingly finally found a way to remove Washington and Lee’s
name and the students’ money from the 100-year-old humor
magazine,

When the true facts of the case become known we feel
sure Monday’s action to remove University support from the
Collegian will be termed by students and faculty alike as noth-
ing but reprehensible, ungentlemanly, and generally disgust-
ing.

Aside from telling only one side of the story, the admin-
istration successfully managed to distort even those facts
it made known. The act will do more to harm student-faculty
relations than years of constructive activity can ever accom-
plish simply because student opinion was walked over.

The Publications Board which is responsible for the Col-
legian designated the March meeting (which was to be held
less than 24 hours after the faculty’s decision was reached) to
review the Collegian’s future with members of the self-study
committee. The purpose of the PB meeting had been public
knowledge since February 10.

In the self-study’s open meeting on Student Life, which
included a section on publications, two members of the PB
were present and specifically asked about the Collegian’s future.
They were told at that time that the issue was not yet ready
to be discussed.

It seems quite apparent to us that the University knew
what it was doing when it choose to place no students on the
sub-committee for publications, while students did serve on
each of the other committes dealing with student life.

Earlier this year the administration had attempted to
sabotage the Collegian by “asking”? Mr. Harold Lauck, W &L’s
print shop supervisor, to stop printing the book. When the
magazine found a printer elsewhere and was actually doing
better financially than in years past, it became obvious to
University officials that a more blatant display of power was
needed.

The ramifications of this action by the administration are
vast. Fundamentally, the administration did not give students
a voice in an area where self-government is supposed to pre-
vail. They not only did not give students a voice but they ef-
fectively cut-off all student attempts to expres stheir views on
the issue.

Do we live under the pretense of a student government,
while in actuality we are living under the influence of a pater-
nal hand which clinches to satisfy its own particular whims,
squeezing from the student body that which is rightfully its
own?

We strongly urge that President Cole throughly investigate
and throughtfully consider the faculty’s action and the circum-
stances which lead to the banning of the Southern Collegian.

Integration at WGEL

We feel that Monday night’s student action to raise funds
to bring a qualified Negro to Washington and Lee is laudable,
but we do question some of the reasoning behind the group's
action.

First, we can see no direct correlation between Washington
and Lee admitting a Negro and the improved academic climate
they suggest this would create. Nor can we see how admitting a
Negro enters at all into a university's greatness or its medioc-

 

rity.

Secondly, raising funds to give a worthy student scholar.
ship aid is certainly laudable. But why must this student be
only a Negro? It seems more logical to us to raise funds for
qualified students regardles of race.

Thirdly, W&L removed itself from any type of student
subsidization program when it dropped subsidized athletics in
1954. Giving aid to a Negro, simply because he is a Negro,
seems to us to be nothing more than subsidizing the race.
Finally, if a Negro were to come to Washington and Lee, we
would like to feel that he will be entering school for the same
wants to and

reason our other students enter because he

not because he is being paid to do so.

Ruffin Finds Balance of Multiversity
And Isolation Necessary For Success

By NICK RUFFIN

To speak meaningfully of Wash-
ington and Lee, one must attempt to
place it in some
perspective in the
society. Washing-
ton and Lee is a
good college. By
good, I mean that
if one were to list
all the colleges in
the United States
and, then, were to
attempt to rate the
colleges, Washing-
ton and Lee would
stand above many
others. Some would be tempted to
go further in the rating, but I find
this rating business to be almost
meaningless for a general apprasial.
About all that one can say is that
a college is good, fair or poor. So
what am I saying? I am saying that
Washington and Lee is good because
at some time in the past, Washing-
ton and Lee achieved a certain ex-
cellence, and this excellence is with
us, in some form today.

Washington and Lee is a small,
private, liberal arts college, physical-
ly isolated from the centers of de-
cision and action in the society.
Washington and Lee has always been
essentially in an ivory tower (re-
gardless of what you think of Lex-
ington). Washington and Lee is free
to observe the society from a dis-
tance. We are not subject to the
whims and fads that sweep the
Metropolis. We are unlikely to fall
victim to temporary folly. We have
the perpective and judgment of dist-
ance from the society, and this dist-
ance is one of our greatest assets.
But there is danger in withdrawing
to the ivory tower. As one gains
perspective on the society, he losses
perspective on himself. Washington
and Lee is not subject to the critical
commentary and tests that society
provides.

   

Ruffin

The ivory tower is intoxicating;
the wisdom gained about others
blinds one to the knowledge of him-
self. The balance in the ivory tower
is difficult to maintain. Washington
and Lee has lost that balance. Unless
the balance is regained Washington
and Lee will lose its race.

Washington and Lee must be able
to justify its existence in the face
of increased competition. The ulti-

Elusive Excellence
The nature of this excellence is
elusive. Washington and Lee has an
able student body, Washington and
Lee has a good faculty, and Wash-

 

mate question is, is Washington and
Lee worth the cost? The society has
limited resources, and it seeks to
obtain the maximum education from
them. The small college is obviously
the most inefficient form of institu-
tion. The multiversity can educate
(I use this word in its broadest
sense) more people more efficiently
than can the small college. The
multiversity can also afford to pro-
vide greater physical facilities, es-
pecially in the sciences, than can the
small college.

Finally, the multiversity can offer
the stimulation of graduate depart-
ments, their libraries and their fac-
ulties, which the small college cannot
offer. The multiversity is more ef-
ficient, and it is usually public or
the recipient of public grants and
aid. The multiversity has access to
great wealth, and as it appears more
efficient, logically should receive this
wealth.

What is left for the small college?
The small college has a future, a
necessary and important one. The
standard argument against the mul-
tiversity is that it makes the student
a number, that the classes are too
large for significant learning, and
that the multiversity overwhelms
the student. I have friends at a few

 

large universities; they say the com-
plaints are exaggerated. They don’t
feel lost or like IBM cards; in their
upper level courses they have fif-
teen to twenty in a class. They like
having James Baldwin, John Ken-
neth Galbraith, Saul Bellow and U.S.
Senators on their campuses as a
matter of course. I think the prob-
lem of large classes will be over-
come soon, as will many other faults
of the large universities. The small
college must offer more than small
classes, and intimacy.

What can the small college offer?
The small college can offer a unity
impossible to imagine in larger col-
leges, a unity of academic program
with a variety of student experience.
No doubt personal contact is easier
between professor and student out-
side the class at a small college. More
important is the idea of interde-
partmental communication between
professors and between students.
This education in many disciplines
is fundamental in a liberal arts edu-
cation, By offering an integrated pro-
gram in the liberal arts transcend-
ing departmental lines, the small col-
lege can produce something close to
the whole man, something the mul-
tiversity many not do.
(Continued next week)

 

ington and Lee has many features,
both good and bad, which make it
Washington and Lee. But high col-
lege boards and a flock of Ph.D.’s
don’t guarantee very much. It is
the quality of students and faculty
in reaction to and with the character

of the institution which make it a
good college.
But I have more to say about

Washington and Lee, for Washing-
ton and Lee’s excellence under
strain; Washington and Lee is ex-
cellent, but only in spite of itself.
Washington and Lee is now con-
sciously or unconsciously in search
of itself. (The self-study will not
find Washington and Lee.)

Search for W&L

nik I, American higher education
faced a revolution in the society
and in itself. Change in education

had never been rapid, but the pres-
sures facing the colleges were enor-

advancing at progressively faster
thereby spawning more
search, and our increased knowledge
was bringing increased problems. The
United States turned increasingly
to the universities. Then came Sput-

accelerated.

Following the Soviet launching in
1957, the educational system, which
previously developed without much

came under question. I think that

Editor Sees W-WGL Plot

By CHARLIE BATSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

The scene, a meeting of the fa-
mous Hill. The problem, the North-
eastern Student,
truly the only
sporting publica-
tion of Walla-
Walla and Leaven-
worth University.

The characters:

Osgood Conklin,
Dean; James
Bombed, adviser

in charge of sec-
recy and spying;
Masura (“Me-
too”) I-to, advis-
er in charge of sneak attacks; New-
ton Minnows, adviser in charge of
censuring and measuring values.
Dean Conklin: I just don’t know
what we are going to do about the

 

Bensinger

Student, the students just enjoy
it too much for our, oops, their own
good.

Bombed: I’ve been running some
surveys, in secret of course, and it
seems that 87.6969 per cent of “our
boys” and 99.9969 per cent of their
dates all wait in drooling expecta-
tions of the next issue. It’s tradi-
tional.

Conklin: To hell with tradition.
How many times do I have to tell
you, never pay any attention to tra-
dition unles it suits your purpose.
If our degenerate “boys” and their
pseudo dates enjoy the rag, then
it must be bad. But what are we
going to do about it?

 

Trivia Contestants Badly Shaken

I-to: Let’s load up the aircraft
carriers and pull a sneak attack!

Conklin: And how many times
have I told you that our navy can’t
get this far up the Jerkwater. The
cadets at Axe Military Academy, in
their atempts to emulate The Point,
have stretched a huge chain across
the river below us.

I-to: Well, I still favor a sneak
attack.

Conklin: I agree with you, but
how?

Minnows: Well, the Student is
amoral and befitting of Berkeley,
not W-W&L. It must be stopped. I
happen to have some experience in
the field of communieations, and
haven’t I done wonders in stopping
student-faculty relations and com-
munications? I would advise using
the self-study format to erase this
blot on our record.

Conklin: That is what I call a
great idea. There is a real thinker.
Go on.

Minnows: We could set up publi-
cations as one of the fields of study,
and then prevent the students from
having anything to do with that
area. We can set up the committee
without students on it, even if it
will be the only one. Everytime that
we are asked anything about it, we
can say that the report is not yet
ready. We can have closed meetings,
and...

Bombed: In secret!

Minnows: Of course. And then for
the crowning blow, just before the

By Entry Of Parsons And Davis

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Mannered Reporter

A flood of new entries for the
Ring-tum Phi-Radio W&L Trivia
Contest has seriously upset the cal-
culations of Las Vegas bookmakers
attempting to establish a betting line
on the event
Most significant of these is a facul-
entry, consisting of information
director Frank Parsons and journal-
Paxton Davis, which
is described by handicapper Gil
Thorp as “a match for all but the
most trivial students.”

ty

ism prolesso

Other teams which enetred before
yesterday's deadline were “Ozark
Oak” Seibert and Phil “Ping-pong”
Runyon for Sigma Chi; Denny Nied-
ringhaus and “Fast” Eddie Allen for
Sigma Nu: and Steve “Blind Duck”
Millard and Rich “Babyface” John-
son Pi Phi. These additions
brought the total number of entries
to 11 for the preliminary quiz Mon-
day night

for

Despite this rush of new entries,
Throp still considers the ZBT team

of Paul “Slinger” Schlesinger and
Charlie “Author” Bensinger to be
the team to beat. “They are well-

balanced—strong in all fields,” Thorp

the

says. “Schlesinger is probably
leading all-round triviator in the
school, while Bensinger adds depth

in the fields of sports and reck and
These other have thei
strengths—Parsons is unbeatable on

also have their weaknesses.”

Commenting on the sophomore-
and-freshman Sigma Chi roster, Tho
said “I really think very few rookies
can make it big in this league. It
takes at least two vears at W&l to
rid a student of all serious thoughts
and give him a really trivial mind,
except in a few special cases. These

There is one other all-freshman
entry, the PEP team of Bob Moselle
and Bern Bonifant, while the Phi
Gam team contains rookie Bob
Knowles as well junior Claude
Ro. J Rodger

Other team competing in the
preliminary contest include Randy

‘Thews’ Mathewson

“The Mad Ukran-

Poore and Dave
ol Kappa Sig; Len

 

ian” Mickle and Bernard “Rip Van
Winkle” Person for the NFU; and
Steve “White Whale” Saunders and
Tom “Rented Bathtub” Doss for SPE.
These teams will take a prelimi-
nary quiz of 50 questions on Mon-
day, March 14. The four teams which
score highest on this test will be
allowed to participate in the final
competition, which will be held in
the Reid Hall studio from 9 to 9:30
p.m. on Tuesday, March 17.
Questions for the preliminary con-
test have already been drawn up,
and include esoteric and _ totally
worthless bits of information from
the fields of rock and roll, television,
old movies, old radio, children’s
books, sports, comic books and com-
ie strips. “Some of them are fairly
easy,” according to Michael Anthony,
“and some of them—I'll drop dead if
anybody gets a couple of these.”

Bensinger Picks Kentucky
To Take NCAA Crown—
Guess Where He’s From?

With the aid and assistance of
Sports Hlustrated, the Friday Ring-
tum Phi has come up with its selec-
tions for the NCAA tournament.

In the East (Raleigh), it will be
Duke over St. Joe, a toss-up between
Syracuse and Davidson (though we
would pick Syracuse if pushed), and
Duke to defeat the winner for the
regional crown

In the Mid-East (lowa City), one
will see Kentucky defeat the world
Kentucky over Dayton, Western
Kentucky over Michigan (how about
that?), and then the Cats to down
the Hilltoppers

In the Mid-West (Lubbock), Kan-
sas will win over S.M.U., and then
over Cincy, the winner of the Cin-
cinnati-Texas Western game. If Tex-
as Western should happen to win,
Kansas will still wind up on top

In the West (Les Angeles), Ore-
gon State will defeat Houston, Utah
will defeat the University of the
Pacific, and Oregon State will win

Scenes of carnage like this were commonplace last night as faculty and
student all-stars, bored with putting each other down in class, started
knocking each other down on the court. A propaganda broadcast from
Shillington’s HQ stated that the Hill squad won, but the students have
asked to interrogate their survivors first.

 

Hill Beats

All-Stars;

Recount Called For

There have been a lot of famous
teams in the history of basketball,
the Original Celtics, the Fiddlin’
Five, the Hank Luisetti-led Stanford
team, and many more. But now there
is a new element injected into this
realm of sport, the Terrible Ten,
better known as the Washington and
Lee Faculty Basketball Team.

Last night in Doremus this collec-
tion of knobby-kneed gentlemen
routed the Fraternity All-Stars, 60-
58, at least by their count.

The faculty starting five of Kozak,
Lowell, Lyles, Eastman, and Phil-
lips (Mickey, of the Information
Service) was matched by students
Shuck Boggs (DU), Randy Poore
(Kappa Sig), Dave Schwinderman
(Pi Phi), Buck Clement (SN), and
Ron Laupheimer (ZBT).

With Ron “Baskethanger” Lau-
pheimer showing the way the stu-
dents pulled into the lead. It was
then that the Faculty began its psy-
cholocial warfare as Herman Tay-
lor lost, not a contact lens, but one
of the lens from his sunglasses.

After the four men pile up (Lyles,
Eastman, Gene Hatfield, and Gray-

 

 

son Powell), the likes of which has
never been seen in the NFL, nor
called a foul in Doremus, the Fac-
ulty closed the gap to 33-18 at the
half.

The high point of the second half
was not Mickey Phillip’s 33-foot
praying set shot, nor Stan “The Man”
Kozak’s bombing sets, nor Norris
Eastman’s driving lay-ups, nor
Norris Eastman’s driving lay-ups,
nor Coach Mac's power plays. It
was not Ed “Hatchet Man” Atwood’s
setting a record for the most uncalled
fouls in one game. It was not the
same star’s move to the worng bas-
ket. It was Coach Keith Shillington.

Never before has anyone called
time-outs or substitutions the way
W&L’s own Red Auerbach did. But
better still was the technical foul.
Coach Shills shot both (yes, two)
shots, and was awarded two points,
one for hitting the rim each time.

Scoring: For the students—Kling-
lehoffer 2, Boggs 2, Poore 7, Wood-
ford 0, Wilson 7, Hawkins 4, Turner

Committee on Publishing’s announc-
ed meeting to discuss the Student,
we can withdraw all school funds.

Conklin: But they really aren't
the school’s funds, they belong to
the students. Oh yes, I see! We just
don’t remind them of that minor
fact, We'll go on collecting publica-
tions fees from them as usual, and
then decide ourselves what to use
their money for, as usual.

I-to: Wonderful, sort of a torpedo
attack.

Conklin: But let’s remember never
to ask the Committee on Publishing
for its opinion.

Bombed: Nor the Collegians’ Wall
Street Association. Let’s do this in
secret.

I-to: But what if the Student raises
the money on its own?

Minnows: That's simple. We just
ask Mr. Lucky, the print shop super,
not to print the magazine. And of
course, it wouldn't be a bad idea
to ask the area printers too.

Conklin: So even if the “boys”
have the money, they won't have a
printer. My Uncle Total Itarianism
would be proud of a plan like this.

Bombed: A secret plan!

Minnows: A secret, sneaky plan.

good. The networks could always
