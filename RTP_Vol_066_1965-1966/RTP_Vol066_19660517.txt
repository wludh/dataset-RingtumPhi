Tom Cox, President of the Dance
Board, announced yesterday that
The Impressions will be featured at
the Finals Concert on May 31st in-
stead of Little Anthony and The
Imperials who broke their engage-
ment last week. The Impressions will
be backed up by the Fabulous Five.
The concert, to be held on Tuesday
night in the Doremus Gynasium,
will end at approximately 10 p.m.
and will be followed immediately by
a combo party at the Pavilion un-
der the sponsorship of the Dance
Board. Ed Allen, social chairman of
the LF.C. and next year’s Fancy
Dress President, said the Orlons,
backed by the Monzas, will be the
scheduled entertainment.

The Impressions

The Impressions are a well-travel-
ed group who hits include: “Gypsy
Woman,” “It’s Alright,’ “Keep
on Pushing,” and “You Must Believe
Me” as well as “I’m so Proud” and
“Amen.” Tickets for the concert
will be placed on sale soon at the
Co-op.

A change of Faculty Advisors to
Dance Board has been necessitated
by the departure of both Dean John
and Coach Norris Eastman, who
have served in this capacity for sev-
eral years. Both of the men will be
seeking further education. Chosen
to replace the two are Drs. Hughes
and Phillips of the Commerce School.

Democrats Set
1966 Elections
This Thursday

The W&L Young Democrats will
conclude their year’s activities with
an elections of officers Thursday at
> p.m. in Payne 6. A president, five
vice presidents, a secretary and a
treasurer are to be elected to head
the 100-member club for next year.

During the past several weeks
W&L Law Young Democrats under
the leadership of president Joe Tate
and with the assistance of the under-
graduate club have been working at
the Rockbridge County Courthouse
compiling a card file of registered
and un-registered voters. The pool
books and city directory are being
used in this effort.

The clubs will use this file to con-
duct a non-partisan registration
drive, backed by various civic or-
ganizations. The Young Democrats
have approached the electoral board
about the possibility of appointing
deputy registrars as has been done
in Charlottesville. However the law
does not authorize this procedure
where registration is done in each
precinct as in Lexington. During the
last part of May and the first part
of June, the law group will con-
centrate on contacting un-registered
voters and urging them to register
before the June 11 deadline

Permission has been secured from
the city manager's office to post
notices on utility polls indicating the
location of Lexington’s registrars.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

 

Ex Uno Plura

For the past few years there has been increasing discussion
concerning the separation of the Law School from the student
government apparatus of the undergraduate school. In an edi-
toral which appeared in last year’s Ring-tum Phi it was pointed
out that only a very few members of the Law School student
body have bothered to have their pictures made for the Calyx.
Judging from this year’s turnout and several other recent
developments, we wish to urge that a serious and responsible
effort be made to affect a complete separation.

If the Law School expects to be pictured in the yearbook
it should be able to round up at least a majority of students
willing to have their pictures taken. The problem is that the
Law School does not want to be in the Calyx nor does it have
much of a desire for any connection at all with the undergradu-
ate school. Law students are not generally interested in the
Ring-tum Phi, Southern Collegian, or the Calyx primarily be-
cause there is so little space devoted to the Law School by these
publications.

Since the student body of the Law School is increasingly
made up of graduates of other colleges, the new Law School
has fewer interests in common with the college. Few law stu-
dents attend undergraduate activities; almost none concern
themselves with undergraduate problems. There are few if any
assimilations in the Law School, and the instances of honor
cases are exceedingly rare.

Representation of the Law School on the student body Exe-
cutive Committee was reduced last year after a constitutional
amendment passed the student body with a comfortable ma-
jority. There are still a few law students who serve on the
standing committees, but these men are almost always alumni
of W&L. In reality law students have almost no contact or
interest in the affairs of the student government or the student
publications.

There are obviously certain occasions such as the Mock
Convention, which cooperation between the Law School and
the college is beneficial. Their familiarity with legal procedure
makes the presence of law students on the Executive Com-
mittee particularly valuable. The same might be said for their
presence on the Student Control Committee.

Nevertheless certain mandatory ties between the Law
School and the college are unreasonable. Why should law stu-
dents have to pay for publications which do not serve their
interests? Why should they be required to support a student
government which hardly affects them and which in turn is not
concerned with their problems? These and other questions de-
serve careful consideration by both the Executive Committee
and the leaders of the Law School. We are certain that a poll
of the law student body would demonstrate their desire to serv-
er their connections with the undergraduate school.

We trust that the responsible leaders in both schools will
explore the possibility of a reorganization which would be in

the best interests of both the Law School and the college.

Washington and Lee students, for
the most part have remained amaz-
ingly detached from one of the most
significant social events in American
history, namely, the civil rights
movement. Not only are we largely
ignorant of many of the sources and
ramifications of this revolution, not
only have we failed to sufficiently
analyze what this means to Washing-
ton and Lee, but we have also failed
to respond to this through actions
which would be directly in the best
interests of this university and its
highest ideals and goals. It is crucial
that we, as students with a direct
interest and responsibility to Wash-
ington and Lee, clearly investigate
our position on racial integration, and
follow up our conclusions with re-
sponsible efforts that enhance, rather

By RICHARD NASH

Last Thursday night, the newly
elected Executive Committee met in
order to adopt general outlines con-
cerning policies for the new Assim-
ilation and Cold Check committees.
During this session I moved that the
Executive Committee consider any
intentional passing of a cold check
by a Washington and Lee student
an honor violation. The motion pass-
ed unanimously and will go into
effect next September.

This move is one which has been
necessitated by the increasing num-
ber of cold checks, both intentional
and non-intentional, that have been
passed in the last two years. The
cashing of a check with the
knowledge that there are insufficient
funds with which to cover it is a
crime punishable by law. But so
common a practice that it has reach-
ed a peak. Not only have many in-
dividual students engaged in the
practice, but many of them have
written ten or more.

This problem seems to stem from
one main source. It is, unfortunately,
the Cold Check Committee itself. Be-
cause of the committee’s existence
and operation, students feel that it

will not get into much trouble, if
at, and they feel free to cash cold
checks here in Lexington when
they would never dream of doing it
at home over the summer.

Because of W&L students taking
advantage of the Cold Check Com-
mittee, our relations with town mer-
chants has suffered considerably.
Most merchants are now hesitant
about cashing checks and some re-
fuse to continue it at all. A few mer-
chants now charge fines for all cold
checks. And others have gone so far

than hinder, the progress of this uni-
versity.

Washington and Lee, as any other
college or university, has a respon-
sibility to provide a service to so-
ciety and to the academic world.
This lies at the center of its justifi-
cation for existing. Yet exactly what
does this responsibility entail? For
one thing, and perhaps most import-
antly, it means that this university
must become a focal point of diverse
experience where all members of so-
ciety may come and grow in human
understanding and hopefully com-
passion. This I would imagine is ob-
vious to everyone.

There is something else which
should also be obvious to everyone,
yet it is certainly not in the case
of the student body. What a sub-

 

is a safeguard. They know that they |

Check Committee and go straight to
the legal authorities.

It became obvious to this year’s
E.C. that something had to be done.
We made a step toward solving the
problem by placing one boy on so-
cial probation and another on con-
duct probation for the continual
cashing of cold checks. These pun-
ishments were not too severe in view
of the number of cold checks passed
by the individuals and the fact that
past E.C.’s have threatened ex-
pulsion from the University for pas-
sage of numerous cold checks. This
year’s Executive Committee debated
the possibility of putting intentional
cold check violators under the honor
system, but never took any decisive
action.

The newly elected E.C. continued

 

 

where the old one left off by passing

overlook or else still refuse to admit
is the fact that Washington and
Lee’s need for diversity cannot come
about unless Negroes are fully in-
tegrated into our community. As
mentioned above, the Negro’s efforts
to achieve equal status, one of the
great events in the struggle to ele-
vate the dignity of the individual, is
something which Washington and
Lee must not experience vicariously
through second-hand newspaper or
Huntley-Brinkley reports. How
could we possibly have any first
hand involvement or knowledge,
when we are so far removed from
the source and participants of this
human struggle?

the free interchange of ideas, of
values and of experience. Yet we

the law. It is hoped that by putting
it into being not only intentional
cold checks, but all carelessness re-
sulting in accidental cold checks will
be curtailed. As a result of this, our
relations with the Lexington mer-
chants will be strengthened

But the question is quickly asked,
“What constitutes an intentional
cold check?” It is simply one written
by a student on insufficient funds,
when he knows that he does not have
those funds, and does not either
post-date the check or inform the
person to whom it is written that he
does not have funds. The following
may help to further explain.

Often times a student will write an
accidental cold check. He does not
have the funds to cover the check
even though he thinks he does

This month witnessed the end of
Washington and Lee’s longest com-
petitive season, From early in Sep-
tember at Freshman Camp to a few
short weeks ago, W&L debaters
have participated in twenty-six de-
bate events.

In what Mr. Chaffin, W&L’s debate
coach and Assistant Professor of
English, called his team’s most suc-
cessful season, debaters won 20 tro-
phies, plaques, and cups, and 16 cer-
tificates of merit.

The debate team is also one of
W&L's furtherest traveling teams.
Literally thousands of miles were put
on Mr. Chaffin's little green Peugeot
in trips to Emory University in At-
lanta, to Dartmouth College in New
Hampshire, and to Ohio State in
Columbus, to name a few of the
many tournaments.

Any season as long as this should
be quiet and leisurely; but week-
end after weekend, matches and
large tournaments are held. In de-
bate there are no restrictions to

performance turned out by freshman
Jim Hamill, a SPE freshman from
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in com-
piling the best won-lost record in
the debate program at Washington
and Lee.

Some of the many people who
have participated in this year’s de-
bate tournaments are Paul Prince,
Kaz Herchold, Dave Marchese, Chris
Mills, Hal Higginbotham, and Tom
Baremore.

But the debate program and trips
should not be in any way interpre-
ted as being mere weekend excur-
sions. The tensions of representing
a college's fame in an intellectual
struggle is just as great as that felt
on the football field in a tie game.

In addition there are the pressures
of travel to and from tournaments in
weather conditions that included
blizzards, checking in and out of
countless hotels, and driving all
night a number of times.

Tomorrow night is the annual de-
bate banquet which is highlighted by
the presentation of several awards
by Mr. Chaffin to the successful de-
baters of the past year. the prizes
to be presented include the Noell-
Eckes Award to be given by Dean
Gilliam to a person selected by Mr.
Chaffin for his service in the field
of intercollegiate debating.

This year began with 87 students
interested in the fleld of debating.
The vast majority of these students
were given the opportunity to par-
ticipate in debates held among W&L
students. From these was gleaned
the few who would represent W&L
at major tournaments.

There is much we need to forget
about what has happened to us at
Washington and Lee. Cruel week-
ends. Sterile classes. Inhuman fel-
lows. We all have a weekend to
erase, a girl we don’t want to re-
member, an unnamed experience to
forget. We will remember the things
that went wrong, the disillusion-
ments, the betrayals.

The ceremony of graduation will
help to make these things seem all
right. Parents will come, confident
all along that their son would get
a fine education at this fine Univer-
sity.

What will we remember on June 3,
as we go through our paces in cap
and grown? We will have forgotten,
already, our dissatisfaction with
Washington and Lee life. The day
will be sunny, our thoughts will be
sunny, A graduate of Washington
and Lee. An educated man. About
to take our places in the proud
and successful ranks of Washington
and Lee alumni. “Be great,” Linwood
Holton told us. We will, every one
of us. Washington and Lee men are
great men.

Today, still in class, still before
exams, we have not yet come to this
feeling of smooth confidence. There
is so much left to do for Washington
and Lee. There are great problems
of education, of discrimination, of
administration. We could have done
so much more to help the Univer-
sity face and solve these problems,
and we could have done so much
more ourselves.

But we didn't. In four years of
college we did little of anything. We
were bored, we were unconcerned,
we were involved.

At graduation, no one will talk
about this. The gloss of graduation
will make us feel that these four
years have been years of growth and
accomplishment. With not much urg-
ing. we will begin to believe.

We will shake hands and be kissed
and be congratulated for our majestic
attainment of a college degree. A
time for joy, a time for celebration,
a time for happy memories of col-
lege days.

These happy memories are now
beginning to come to the surface as
June approaches. Maybe a few things
did go wrong. Perhaps we didn't
learn or do everything the way we
hoped. But these were wonderful
years, weren't they? Weren't they?

The campus is beginning to look
beautiful and dreamlike. We are
beginning to be proud that we have
spent four years in Lexingten at
Washington and Lee. As these days
pass we will more and more develop
an affection for our University.
Graduation will give us a framework
for these ideas and emotions

Soon we will forget the evils, the
injustices, the stupidities we have

 

(Continued on page 4)

 

are presently failing miserably in our
knowledge and understanding of the
ideas, values and experience of over
ten per cent of America’s population.
Yet we are being almost totally
passed over by a transformation in
American society and morality which
has already, and shall continue to
permeate the very depths of the
American and human experience.
How many of us have ever confront-
ed Negroes of our equal on an in-
tellectual or social level? Gentle-
men, it is no longer sufficient for us
to claim a knowledge and under-
standing of the Negro situation and
efforts because we were raised with
a “Mammy” which we think the
world of, or because we worked with
Negroes in our father’s warehouse
one summer.

And at the same time, it is no
longer possible for this university
to claim a place among the great
universities of this country. We are
a very good university; the fact
that we are so removed from the
mainstream of contemporary exper-
ience (in the sense that we remain
all white) necessarily precludes us
from greatness. Although I am aware
that each year we graduate men
who will become “leaders” in so-
ciety, 1 am more than a little appre-
hensive about the quality and di-
rection of any leadership which is
so detached from a most crucial as-
pect of contemporary experience.

If my analysis is correct, the stu-
dent body breaks down into three
general categories with respect to its
attitude coneerning racial integra-
tion here. There exists, on one ex-
treme, a number of students total
ly opposed to any Negroes whatso-
ever becoming members of this com-
munity. These people most likely
discard anything I have said up to
here, as well as all other arguments
supporting the desireability and the
need for racial integration here (or
anywhere). There also exists, on
the other extreme, a number of stu-
dents like myself, conviced of the
need for diversity through the in-
clusion of Negroes, and determined
to help affect this situation.

A substantial number of | this
group, as myself, also feel that this
entire question is largely one of mor-
ality, and that any efforts to per-
petuate discrimination against any
human being is immoral. Then there
remains what I believe is the larg-
est group of students: those who are
willing, perhaps even desire, to have
integration come about but only
through a natural sequence of events
and without conscious effort on the
part of Washington and Lee to hast-
en the process. Some of this group
no doubt regrets that integration
must take place but accepts its in-
evitability, while others are more
neutral in their attitude. The main
attitude which characterizes this
group is the fact that, willing or
resigned, they don’t believe any
conscious efforts which would facili-
tate or speed up Washington and
Lee’s becoming integrated should be
made. There are several points, di-
rectly relevant to all three attitudes,
which | would like to comment upon.

I do not favor any more than
most others the idea that Washing-
ton and Lee go out and “buy” a
Negro. I do not believe any more
than most that one, or even several
Negroes, will give this university the
diversity it so crucially needs. When
I analyze the situation, I find that
I am as much disturbed and afraid
about the fact that there are no
Negroes here as I am disturbed and
afraid of the type of thought which
could allow, and still allows, this
situation to prevail. I view the ideal
situation not as one where Washing-
ton and Lee would have to bend
over backwards to locate and admit
Negroes, but rather as one where
qualified Negroes would naturally
desire to come here just like any
of us—where our admissions policy
would recruit qualified Negro stu-
dents in exactly the same manner
in which they now recruit qualified
white students. But this is not pres-
ently the case, and there are sev-
eral reasons why this cannot, for
the present, be so.

It is absolutely naive and unreal-
istic for this university to either hope
or believe it can attract qualified
Negro applicants until it first dem-
onstrates not only its willingness,
but also its determination to fully
accept them into the community.
Although one would perhaps cite
the ruling by the board of trustees
to the effect that this university will
not discriminate against any appli-
cant becouse of race as an example
of our willingness to accept Negroes,
I would contend that this is for
from encouraging in the eyes of a
Negro, and that besides there has
been nothing tangible to follow up
this initial effert. Furthermore, the
important distinction is that this de-
cision remains in the realm of

olf Places Third

Golf Third At
St. Louis CAC

Mathews In Second Place
With 150; Fulwider Shoots
Next With A 153

By LEX TARUMIANZ

This past weekend the Washington
and Lee golf team traveled to St.
Louis for the annual Spring Sports
Festival at Washington University.
The team finished third in team
standings with a four-man total of
615, ten strokes behind second-place
Washington University.

Sewanee captured both team hon-
ors and individual honors, as John
Capers of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania,
won the individual title.

Bobby Mathews

Washington and Lee Freshman
Bobby Mathews finished in a tie for
second place with a 150 total. He
shot 72 in the first round and led
going into the second round by two
strokes. He shot a 78 in the second
round. His 72 on Friday was the best
turned in by a W&L player. His
two-over-par 72 was shot on a wet
course which was playing quite long.
Tied for second with Mathews were
Charlie Sanders of Centre and Billy
Nayner of Sewanee.

Jim Fulwider recorded the second
best score for Washington and Lee
with a total of 153 for 36 holes. Spen-
cer Sullivan shot a 155 and Captain
Ed Crosland shot 157 to complete
W&L’sfour man team.

Washington and Lee completed
the season a with 4-3 record and a

third place in the C.A.C.

 

Spring Soccer

Sunday afternoon on Wilson Field
the Varsity and Freshmen soccer
team defeated the Alumni, 3-2.

The returning Alumni team con-
sisted of Dave Redman, Bruce Jack-
son, Tim Henry, West Horner, and
Dave Kirkpatrick. The rest of the
team was made up from law stu-
dents.

Scoring two goals for the Varsity
was Scott Fechney. The other goal
was made by Captain Fred Skinner.
The goals for the Alumni were scor-
ed by West Horner and Tim Henry.

The purpose of the spring soccer
match was to ascertain the potential
strengths and weaknesses of next
year’s team. As a result, it was found
that there will be five very difficult
positions to fill, places left empty
by graduating seniors.

The score of the game was un-
usually close, Coach Lyles announc-
ed, because the team had had only
three or four days to practice, as
opposed to the two weeks spring
practice last year.

Coach Lyles announced that soccer
practice would begin next fall on

Track Goes To Conference

Field Events Prove Downfall

By JOHN THIEMEYER

The Washington and Lee track
team flew to St. Louis over the
weekend to go up against the four
other teams comprising the College
Athletic Conference. Action was lim-
ited on the first day by foul weath-
er but on Saturday competition
finally got underway.

Buck Mynttinen

W&L showed good strength in the
distance races, but weaknesses in
the field events proved to be the
team’s demise. In fact, the only
bright spot in the field events was
a second place by SPE Senior Buck
Mynttinen. Other seniors shared the
spotlight as Lee Johnson got a sec-
ond in the two-mile run with a time
of 10:02.6, followed by Ralph
O’Connor with a 10:20.2 and a third
place, and finally Jim Thompson
who ran a 50.9 second quarter for a
fourth place.

Backing up these seniors were sev-
eral promising freshmen. Of partic-
ular note were Ralph Pearcy in the
mile, Dave Ennis in the 120 yd. high
hurdles and the three freshmen on
the fourth-place 440-yd. relay team.

Bob Stack continued his excel-
lent running with a 4:313 in the
mile which was good for a third
place. He was backed up by Pearcy,
who got a fourth place with a 4:39.8.

440-yd. Relay

The 440-yd. relay team consisting
of Freshman Norwood, Price, Hinkle,
and Sophomore Horne, took fourth
place with 449 seconds. The other
relay team turned in a 3:32 mile
time which was good for a fifth
place.

Though eclipsed in the interme-
diate hurdles, Washington and Lee
came through in the 120-yd. high
hurdles with a third and a fifth
place by Freshman Ennis and Junior
Jeff Kugel respectively. Ennis ran
this race in 16.4 seconds, four tenths
of a second ahead of Kugel.

Undoubtedly, Washington and Lee
will be substantially hurt by the
loss of seniors Jim Thompson, and
Rick Mynttinen, Ralph O’Connor,
and Lee Johnson. Each of these four
has accumulated a very impressive
number of points while at W&L.
Fortunately, boosted by strong fresh-
man support in all areas, the team
stands a very good chance of mov-
ing ahead in the next few years.

 

W@L Baseball Team
Loses to Sewanee,

Centre, At CAC

By JOHN THIEMEYER

The baseball team closed the year
with mixed emotions Saturday when
they were blanked by the C.A.C.
competition at Washington Univer-
sity. Forced by a Friday rainstorm
to play a doubleheader on Saturday
morning, the team lost first to
Centre, 9-3, and then a little more
than an hour later to the Sewanee
team, 7-1.

The Sewanee game was the last
at Washington and Lee for two out-
standing Seniors. Dave Kirkpatrick
at shortstop and Eric Sisler at sec-
ond base provided successful hitting
and fielding throughout their tenure
here.

In the way of future developments,
there are a number of freshman
hopefuls, in particular, center fielder
Tom Mitchell and catcher John
Wolfe. Mitchell provided two triples.
The pitching of Sophomore Bill Ras-
mussen and Junior Pete Heumann
looked really good.

Hampered by abnormally bad
weather this season, the team posted
a 3-7 record including the C.A.C,
tournament games. Next year, how-
ever, will possibly feature more
games scheduled for earlier in the
season, and perhaps a spring trip

 

down South.

Coach Canfield Reveals Basketball
Prospects For Next Year’s Team

By DAVE SCHWENDEMAN

When all-state basketball star Mel
Cartwright decided to come to W&L
everyone realized that the Gener-
als basketball program is moving
forward. What people fail to under-
stand is all the work Coach Verne
Canfield, his staff, and his players
have done to start the rebuilding
process.

Canfield has been fighting for
Cartwright since Mel's junior year.
“Getting a boy like Mel is hard
work,” said the coach. “VPI, Georgia
Tech, UVa. West Point, and others
were all offering Mel full scholar-
ships.”

“We were able tosell him on our
fine academic standing, the small
school atmosphere, and the lack of
big-time basketball pressure. At
W&L Mel will get no aid other than
that awarded him through the Rob-
ert E. Lee Scholarship he earned
by being a good student.”

Cartwright is not the only pros-
pect in the class of 1970. Canfield
predicts, “Next year’s freshmen will
be the best group of basketball play-
ers ever to enter W&L. What's more,
they are fine boys and the type of
gentlemen we want here.”

These prospects include: Mel Wes-

Team will give its
final show of the

Anyway, we're finally going to see
the entire equestrian team riding to-
gether. Heading the team will be
the captain, that queen of the saddle,
Mary Ann Trots. The girls will ex-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Mindel Discusses Negro Attitude

(Continued from page 2)
“willingness”; I would challenge any-
one to cite evidence of our “determi-
nation” to accept Negroes into our
ranks. As was pointed out in a re-
cent Ring-tum Phi editorial, there is
indeed little incentive for a qualified
Negro to really want to attend Wash-
ington and Lee. Not only have we,
individually and collectively, failed
to express our determination to ful-
ly accept him as an integral part
of the community, but also must we
point to a long history of prejudice,
a fraternity system which allows
both implicit and explicit racial dis-
crimination, and all white student
body and faculty, and an amazing
indifference to the ideals, values
and events which characterize Negro
life today.

This situation is rendered all the
more despicable because of the fact
that we students ourselves (and fac-
ulty) can actually do more towards
making Washington and Lee more
attractive to qualified Negroes than
the trustees, administration or any-
one else ever do. For it is only our-
selves who have the power to force-
fully demonstrate to everyone, white
and Negro alike, our determination
to achieve a truly diversified com-
munity. This is the idea behind the
fund which has been established for
the furtherance of any aspect of
the actual racial integration process
here; it is hoped that students will
voluntarily contribute to this fund.

tions passed by the Executive Com-
mittee; it is hoped that students will
actively encourage qualified Negroes
to apply for admission.

These then, are some of the prob-
lems and choices which confront
Washington and Lee in its attempt
to achieve a more diversified uni-
versity.

The obvious question is what can
and must we as students do to be
the greatest aid to Washington and
Lee in its effort to progress with
the rest of society. It must be empha-
sized that one’s “willingness” to ac-
cept or achieve a truly integrated
community means precisely noth-
ing—if this is not accompanied by
an expression of one’s “determina-
tion,” to do so. It is about time the
student body came down from their
“splendid isolation” and made a com-
mitment on this matter. One of our
Contact speakers told us to our faces
that Washington and Lee was suf-
fering from a “pernicious anemia”
in that we were all white; to this
charge, 1 would add that we are suf-
fering from another “pernicious
anemia” besides the fact that we are
all white: namely, that we even re-
fuse to honestly and responsibly take
a stand which we are willing to
support through action. It requires
little courage to retain a “benign
and neutral silence” on an issue,
yet it also requires little insight to
see that this issue could very weil
become Washington and Lee’s nem-

 

This is the idea behind the resolu-

esis.

through an error in bookkeeping,
etc. This would not be considered
an honor violation.

Many students now commonly use
the practice of post-dating a check.
This is done when a student needs
money but has none in the bank.
He writes the check, but makes an
agreement with the merchant to put
not the present date, but a future
date on the check. The understand-
ing is that by the time the check
falls due, the student will have added
enough to his account to cover the
amount of the check. The merchant
does not try to collect on that check
until the agreed date arrives. Under
the new law, this would not be
considered an honor violation, either.

There is always the possibility that
a boy will cash a check with the
expectation of receiving money from
home later in the day. He intends
to deposit this money upon its ar-
rival. But what if the expected mon-
ey does not come and the merchant
goes to the Cold Check Committee?
Would this be an honor violation.
No, not if the boy could prove that
he had reason to expect the funds.

 

Nash Says Cold Checks Violation

The safest way to avoid this type
of situation, however, is to post-date
the check or make sure the mer-
chants understands you are expect-
ing funds.

Suspicion of intentional passing of
cold checks will be reported by the
Cold Check Committee to the Execu-
tive Committee. Also, students with
information concerning the inten-
tional passing of cold checks are
obligated to report it to the E.C. just
as they would cheating on a test. The
reports to the Executive Committee
will set in motion an investigation
and a possible trial just as any other
suspected honor violations would do.

It is important to keep entirely
clear that the passing of a cold check
is not an honor violation. It is the
intentional passing of a cold check
that falls under the honor system.

It is the feeling of the 1966-67
Executive committee that the inten-
tional cashing of a cold check is
dishonorable and it will be consider-
ed an honor system violation. It is
the E.C.’s hope that every W&L stu-
dent will refrain from the intentional
passing of cold checks just as he
would refrain from plagiarism or
cheating on a test.

CAMPUS
FASHIONS

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

SUMMER STANDS POISED on the edge of campus, ready to rush

in and fill the void as classes, exams, and term papers come to their
appointed ends. For Summer ’66, your wardrobe will accent the
colorful and the casual. Here are a few pointers on what to take
along when you split the academic scene,

BASKETBALL BEACHWEAR? why not? We

already have the classic “boxer” short. This
season one important swimwear trend derives
from the basketball courts. The style is moder-
ately trim-fitting, and its trademark is side
vents. New sport-oriented color combinations
take precedence: look for white cotton trunks with navy binding
down the sides and around the legs; navy trunks with beige trim,
and maroon trunks with navy bindings.

 

“BY THE SEA, BY THE SEA, by the beautiful sea...” Do you re-

call those colorful cardboard plaques with a cut-out hole to pop
your head through to be photographed in a legitimate 1890's beach
scene? Do you remember the hilarious beachwear fashions of our
Victorian grandfathers? Well, modified versions of the same are
back, and for sheer fun in the sun, they’re unbeatable. Look for
bold, striped, stretch cotton knit outfits. Shirts feature a Henley
neck, while the usually matching stretch swim trunks reach half-
way to your knees, Bold belt treatments, adjustable side tabs, and
fully-lined shorts are all part of this “new” fashion. “Dipping,
anyone?”

BELTED BRIEFS, bold colors, and trim lines

cut from stretch fabrics may be more to the
typical college man’s taste. Husky brass and
silver buckles complement broader belts. Colors
) are hot and bright: vivid blue-green blends,
vibrant reds, yellows and oranges, and an end-
less variety of stripe and border treatments.

 

C.P.0.’S FOR SUMMER. The chier Petty Officer shirt, along with

bell bottoms and the classic Navy pea jacket, are three major
fashion contributions of your local Army Navy store, The pea
jacket is reserved for winter wear (though its double-breasted
idea carries over in many of this summer’s colorful blazers). Bell-
bottoms are already a summer staple, and this season will see the
C.P.0. shirt introduced for warm weather wear. Chief C.P.0,
characteristics: they're blue, non-button-down, and have two
flapped pockets in front. Many models feature epaulettes, Look
for them in cotton, brushed denim and polyester blends in both
long and short sleeved models,

RAINBOWS OF COLOR mark this season’s

soft, cotton sweatshirts in a wide variety of
styling variations, Color to your taste in peach,
pink, red or coral, lime, orange, copper or
bronze, burgundy, lavender, or smoky charcoal,
Styles include the traditional crew neck with
Jong sleeves, V-necks, turtlenecks and mock
turtles by the score, some featuring short-sleeved styling. Boating
parkas in water repellent nylon will mostly be seen in bold com-
| petition stripes. Hot horizontal or vertical stripes in, for example,
| white, yellow or red, complement body colors in Navy, blue-green
blends, and burgundy, And don’t overlook bell bottoms in blue
stretch denim, poplin jackets with a front zipper and a drawstring
bottem, and India madras walking shorts.

 

 

THE SANDS OF TIME swirl thi

gh the hourglass, and another

| academic year bites the dust. Now it's time for sandy beaches, skin

diving, water skiing, and sai *, However you select to spend your
summer make the most of it, a .d with luck we'll both be
back next Fall with the scoop on Back-to-College fashions, See
you then.
