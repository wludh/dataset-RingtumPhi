‘Collegian’ Issue
Sent To Student
Affairs By Cole

President Fred C. Cole has writ-
ten to Publications Board President
Drew Baur, indicating that the ques-
tion of the Southern Collegian would
be referred again to the faculty’s
Student Affairs Committee. The
President's action came in the wake
of a continued controversy over the
faculty's recommendation that funds
for the humor magazine be dropped.

The Collegian was started dur-
ing the administration of President
Robert E. Lee, in 1868, and was
a literary magazine until well into
this century. The faculty, in with-
drawing its support said the publi-
cation was in poor taste and reflect-
ed badly on the University.

The Publications Board immedi-
ately passed a resolution urging re-
consideration and questioning the
supposedly “secretive” handling of
the matter. The Student Body Ex-
ecutive Committee supported the
Publications Board's position, and
passed a resolution of endorsement.

In other Publications Board busi-
ness, it was announced that M:
James Boatwright has agreed to fill
the vacancy on the Board caused by
the resignation of Dr. Sydney M. B
Coulling. Dr. Coulling described the
for his resignation as “en-
tirely personal,” involving other
commitments, and not having any
connection with the Collegian con-
troversy

The Washington and

IFC Proposes
New Definitions
For Functions

By JOHN LEE

At last night’s IFC meting, two
constitutional amendments as well as
several other proposals were dis-
cussed. A new definition of social
functions to include the four Uni-
versity dance weekends and seven
combo weekends clarifies the vague-
ness Of the past definitions. As
stated in the IFC constitution, “a
social function shall be any affair,
excluding meals, a.) involving mem-
bers and their dates and b.) paid for
with fraternity funds (with or with-
out musical entertainment).”

A new provision for “chip-in”
parties are those “differing from the
University Dance Weekends and the
seven “Combo Weekends” in that
each individual member or pledge of
the sponsoring fraternity is given an
opportunity to choose whether or
not to contribute towards the cost
of such social function. Paid musical
entertainment is not allowed at any
“chip-in” party.

The proposed _ constitutional
amendment that each fraternity
work with a CPA rather than Dean
Dean Atwood on house finances, was
defeated. Many of the houses felt
that the suggested system would
place too stringent rules upon their
financial operation. The proposal
which had previously been passed
by the Student Affairs Comimttee,
will discussed by that com-
mittee, and an informal poll will be
taken of all fraternity’s suggestions

Lee Club was especially recognized
se

its success last November in
carrying Rockbridge County for the

first time in a century. The Club
this year also presented several
outstanding Republican speakers,

sponsored a Political Action Course,
increased membership more than 23
per cent to include over a quarter
of the student body, and hosted the
weekend convention at Natural
Bridge.
New Chairman

The new Chairman of the Virginia
CYR Federation has a broad Repub-
lican background which began in his
hometown of Fort Worth, Texas
Roger Wallace was active in the
1960 Presidential Campaign for Nix-
on, helped organize Teen Age Re-
publican clubs in Texas and in 1963
was named the Outstanding Teen
Age Republican in the Nation. Wal-
lace is a rising senior at Washington
and Lee. Besides serving as YF Club
President, in 1964 he was YF Chair-
man at W&L, and attended the Na-
tional Republican Convention in San
Francisco as Chief Page for the Re-
publican National Committee Pub-
lic Relations Division.

Convention Hosts

As convention hosts, W&L stu-
dents participated in every phase of
convention activity. Nearly forty
W&L students participated as dele-
gates or in the planning for the
three-day affair. Sophomore Jeff
Wainscott was Convention Co-ordi-
nator while Alan Rains and Art
Love served as Arrangements Com-
mittee Co-chairmen.

The Natural Bridge Convention
had representatives from sixty-
seven Young Republican, College

Young Republican, and Teen Age
Republican clubs. The main order

The Perennial Problem

Shortly after the spring recess the campus will once again
be the center of intense political activity. The elections for
student body officers and the class elections will occupy most
month of April. If last year’s pattern is any indication of the
chaos we can expect, it would be wise for the Executive Com-
mittee to take steps to avoid another free-for-all.

Political Parties

The exact manner of handling elections has been the
source of particular concern for the E.C., and a workable so-
lution is not yet formulated. The question of political parties
inevitably occupies a part of any discussion on elections and
procedures. If the two-party system returns to the campus this
spring, it will necessarily be the product of spontaneous gener-
ation. The E.C. cannot arbitrarily impose political order of the
student body regardless of its merits.

Increased apathy

Perhaps the idea of some party organization is still repul-
sive to a large majority of students, but we would submit that
some sort of stream-lining in the nomination process would be
welcomed by candidates and voters alike. The unfortunate
aspect of multiple candidacies is that the student body becomes
even more apathetic than usual. By the second run-off it is
surprising to have over half of the membership of the student
body voting. Certainly, this is not a healthy political climate.

We do not have any plan or proposal which will eliminate
the problems which elections have encountered at W&L over
the last few years. The issue can, however, be ignored only at
the risk of impairing effective and responsible student govern-
ment.

Wanted: Talent And Time

In the past year the absence of the Southern Conservative
has been particularly distressing to us. For several years it has
occupied a respected place among the publications of our Uni-
versity community. Its wide circulation outside the campus
attracted additional contributions, both financial and literary.
Perhaps the most valuable aspect of this newspaper was its
responsible position among articulate conservative journals on
the college campus.

 

Long on Funds

According to reports from the present editor of this pub-
lication, Jim Bruton, it seems that funds are available, but there
is a shortage of individuals to assemble an issue. The Conserva-
tive Society which is a separate organization is also interested
in reviving the Conservative, but has not yet enlisted adequate
support. We would like to urge any students interested in the
technical or editorial areas of newspaper work to contract Mr.
Bruton for further information concerning the opportunities

available on The Southern Conservative.

Short on Talent

We firmly believe that the Southern Conservative like the
Collegian is suffering from a lack of talent which in the former
case is fatal and in the latter case is likely to be so. The South-
ern Conservative should be a dynamic force not only on this
campus, but also on the dozens of campuses across the country
which actively support it. Certainly this newspaper can be and,
indeed, has been a distinctive characteristic of Washington and
Lee. It will be a credit to the entire University of publication
can be resumed in the outstanding tradition of former years.

A Much-Needed Revival

The traditionally Republican orientation of Washington
and Lee has stifled any attempts at building a strong Young
Democrats Club on campus to compete with the Young Re-
publicans. For many years, Young Democrats had barely
enough members to fill all of its officer positions.

Under the leadership of Faculty adviser William Chaffin,
the Young Democrats have achieved a remarkable success.
Membership has reached the highest level in years and in-
terest in the club and its activities has increased greatly.

State Officers Elected

Their success this year was capped off this weekend when
two W&L Young Democrats were elected to state office in
their organization. Law School Freshman Dick Israel was elect-
ed Western Vice Chairman of the Virginia Federation of Col-
lege Young Democrats and Academic Freshman Ray Hart-
well was elected Vice Chairman of the Seventh District Vir
ginia Federation of Young Democrats.

We extend our congratulations to the new officers, and
also to those men whose efforts on the local level at Washing-
ton and Lee to strengthen the Young Democrats resulted in
their victory this past weekend.

By WARD BRIGGS

I cannot say too much about The
Pawnbroker. The performance of
Steiger as Sol Nazerman the pawn-
broker is extraordinary. His is by
turns a young German Jew with a
beautiful wife and family, a prisoner
at Auschwitz, forced to witness his
own wife in a brothel, and an ag-
ing pawnbroker in Spanish Harlem.
He sleeps with the wife of his best
friend whom he saw torn to pieces
by a dog and he supports her. He
stays with his wife’s sister on Long
Island and supports them. He is
attracted by a middle-aged, saggy
social worker, but avoids a rela-
tionship with her that might have
brought to him a measure of human-
ity.

He hires a Puerto Rican boy who
only wants to rib him, and teaches
him to “tell gold” and count money
above all else. He is a front man for
a Negro gangster, hesitating to ful-
fill the demands only when he learns
that his money comes in part from a
brothel. He gives away money to
alcoholics and junkies because they
are no more to him than human
junk,

The ugliness and horror of this
world force Nazerman to resign from

it altogether, to destroy himself, as
he feels his entire race has done,
and becores entirely devoted to the
process fo making money, This be-
comes his sole concern until at last
he is suddenly, in the three days
we glimpse on film, transformed into
a feeling human being.

His family had been dead for
twenty years, and his only reality
had been money. But suddenly the
years of anguish well up and ex-
plode in a mute, horrible grimace
that is as powerful as any of his
brilliant tirades against the world he
so frequently lends himself to.

He must, at the end, face the pain
of life. He cannot ignore the poor
winos and junkies any longer, so
he gives them they money they so
desire. He cannot obey the Big Boss
(Brock Peters) who in my opinion
is the finest Negro actor in America:
ef. To Kill a Mockingbird and L-
Shaped Room). He cannot be run
over by the Puerto Rican hoods, so
he obdurately refuses to be robbed
by them. And he cannot face the
violence of the world in which he
lives so he impales his hand on a
spike as if the expiate sins done on
his account.

Throughout this series of incidents,

 

    

Steiger is consistently brilliant in
the part of a cynic which might
seem deceptively easy to play. Brock
Peters is his usually Negroid self,
playing a different stereotype to the
hilt in each movie in which he per-
forms.

Geraldine Fitzgerald as the con-
fined social worker is sufficiently
impressive to warrant mention, Sid-
ney Lumet’s (The Hill, Long Days
Journey Into Night) direction brings
all the action home by placing it
squarely in the midst of Spanish
Harlem. This sense of locale together
with the constant, cage-like shadows
which play on Steiger’s face while
he is in the pawn shop are most ef-
fective.

To me, the most memorable parts
of the movie are the cameo portray-
als of the people who pawn things.
The intellectual Negro wino who
wants to pawn his latest literary ac-
quisition, the courtly old Negro with
the butterfly collection. the white
teenage junkies with the recalcitrant
radio, and the pregnant young girl
are beautifully and touchingly pro-
trayed, if a bit too melodramatically
hand-picked.

The most touching of all is the

Law School Found To Be

By EDMUND BURKE
To whom it may concern:

I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to thank whoever it was,
whether a law student or Mr. Rob-
ertson, who cleaned the footbath on
the main floor of Tucker Hall. Not
that it's been put on the approved
list of the Board of Health or any-
thing, but at least the Student Bar
Association or some other authority
has seen fit to remove the toilet seat
with the skull and crossbones from
it. Every litter bit helps.

I might also note that the self-
analysis boys have demurred to
Staff Keekin’s picture of a 4'' cob-
web dismissing it as so much rub-
bish. Actually, the picture submitted
was found to be an old biack-out
curtain installed by the law wives
during the War and apparently left
up by janitorial neglect when the
others were removed so that they
might be used to buff the floor wax
back in "46. (They are now in the
process of counting annual rings to
determine which ‘46.)

Self-Analysis

Speaking of seli-analysis, the stu-
dent version of some lead the science
department to an important discov-
ery. It has been given a Ford Foun-
dation grant to extract anti-jungle-
rot serum from the rats which have
been eating the mold off the books
in the basement. The department
would have liked to have ebtained
the moldy books too, but wasn't able

to do so. Not that the books are
valuable, but George “Somebody
stole my bed" Fisher, a budding

Property I genius, holds the mineral
rights to the English Reports

The science department has given
up hope of expanding its operation
to the main floor of the library. It
finds that if leaves ean come through
the screened windows, other im-
purties, like dust fer a starter, might
also make their way in amongst the
books. The disappointment, however,
is tempered with the hope that the
fauna in the hall drinking fountain
may be eulturable in test tubes

Cherry Smash

 

Robin Dyer, who, in defining

Littered By Drink Bottles

“Cherry Smash,” scored a 1.25 on
a Torts quiz for confusing a form
of assault with a pie sold by the
SBA and commonly used as a book
marker, since discovered that a re-
cent birthday address omitted an-
other similarity between student life
at present and that in 1866. While
working on a Robert E. Lee Re-
search grant, he discovered a note
saying, “If you can’t clean and de-
orderize the Men's Room, put in a
bigger fan. R.E.L.”

Students of cybernetics will be
glad to learn that the Law School
has now amassed quite a collection
of bottles. These have been banded
with numbers in an effort to trace
their travels, a system to study the
migration of ducks and other quack -
ers. At blast-off (11:00 p.m. Wednes-
day) ground zero conditions were:
SBA Room, Empty cases—14; Emp-
ties in cases—64; Empties loose—10;
Garbage Cans—1l; empty Doughnut
Boxes—10.

Basement Hall Only

Basement Hail (only): Empty cas-
es—17; Empties in cases—682; Emp-
ties loose—10; Garbage Cans—4;
empty Doughnut boxes—4, (There
is no overlap in the above fallout
stats.)

As a tribute to how well our new
“No Food in the Library Areas”
campaign is going, only 4 bottles
were in the main library at 11:00
p.m., and those were mostly being
used as ash trays. There is also a
nete on the SBA doorway on a
“KEEP IT CLEAN” sign. “Our Mot-
to; Get the food out but keep the
dirt in.” On the wall inside: Credit

and Faculty.” Next to this is a list of
18 undergraduates who owe Al

should react against the glass frag-

that just happen to be floating in

action for injuries incurred while

will kick us once again in the back-
side.

Times, as we mentioned above, do
change.

Once upon a time, when univer-
sities were getting their start in a
place called Europe, matters stood
a little differently. People in these
universities had a much different
idea as regards education and stu-
dents and faculty—and especially as
regards money.

‘Way back then, believe it or not,
the university was controlled by the
students. The faculty members were
paid directly by the students. At
the end of a class the young men
would plunk down their money—if
they thought they had learned some-
thing. If not, the professor starved.
Or began to teach a little better a
whole lot faster.

And even earlier in history much
the same was the case. A student or
students would pay a man to teach
them what he knew. These teachers
went from place to place, and they
had to have something going for
them or pretty soon they went back
to growing grapes.

But as the years went by, the
process of education began to be
more structured and _institutional-
ized and the faculty began to run
things and the students’ money be-
gan to be handled by some inter-
mediary and faculty people began
to be paid on a regular (and im-
personal) basis. Which is all well
and good.

But here we are in the year of our
Lord 1966 and we have a faculty vot-
ing students’ money around. Times
appear to have changed.

Very few of us seem to remember
that the students are paying the
teachers to work for them. If any-
body starts to withhold money, a
good place to start might be with the
students, whose money it is.

Back in the olden days a man who
didn’t give you his money’s worth
didn’t get your money.

I wonder what would happen if we
did get back to that old idea that the
university is for the student (not
the faculty or the alumni or who-
ever else.)

And I wonder what would happen
if we withheld our money (‘tuition’
as it’s called today) when we didn’t
like what the faculty or the college
administration was doing. Say in
terms of integration, or education or
both. Or more.

But times have changed, haven't
they, kiddies.

And the faculty votes money about

W&L Plays Yale Tomorrow;
Heads North On Weekend

Washington and Lee University’s lacrosse Generals minus
their one-two scoring leaders and first two goalies of last year

will open a 10-game schedule
experienced 45-man squad.

here tomorrow, hosting Yale’s

It will be only the second meeting between the two schools
ever, the first played in Lexington back in 1948 with the Gen-

erals taking a 7-3
Elis.

But Yale, braced with 16 letter-
men and 18 seniors, should have the
edge today, as should the rest of
W&L’s forthcoming opponents, since
the Generals will field a relatively
young and inexperienced club. Alto-
gether, W&L can count only three
seniors and 10 lettermen on its roster

Perhaps the weakest W&L position
will be attack, where graduated at-
tackmen Carroll Klingelhofer and
Mike Michaeles, the Generals’ scor-
ing leaders in 1965 with a combined
43 goals and assists, have left
their jobs to sophomore Chip Chew
and freshman Joe Wich. Sophomore
Tom Pittman will return at crease to

give the Generals some experience
there, but additional attack help
must come from three untested

freshmen.

Goal will be another major prob-
lem created by graduation losses.
Sophomore Dave Johnson, who saw
limited action last season behind
seniors Butch West and Frank Mor-
gan, now has the job to himself,
although second-year-man Jim
Dawson could provide some able
reserve strength. Johnson turned in
seven saves in four games last year.

Midfield and defense are somewhat
stronger in number of lettermen and
over-all personnel. Senior letter
winners Billy Andrews, Bruce Jack-
son, and Jay Bowersox lead the mid-
fielders, while juniors Lance Ben-
dann, Warren Stewart, and Ben
Gambill are the most capable W&L
defenders.

War Discussed
By Philosopher
Last Tuesday

George Lear, philosopher and ac-
tivist, addressed 50 members of the
faculty and student body last Tues-
day on the “Problem of War.”

Mr. Lear, who received his B.A. at
Amherst in Philosophy, his M.A. in
Philosophy at Cornell and is present-
ly writing his doctoral thesis,
on a set of personal values which
is adopted, would make war impos-
sible for Man.

Man is caught in the conflict of
two sets of competing values. The
first, Pacific desire, is the general
desire not to kill or participate in
killing (therefore war) in any way.
The basis of this desire is inherent
in man and is derived from the real-
ization that each man is human and
should be treated as human.

The other desire, social desire,
is directly opposed to the first. This
desire evolves from the desire to
conform to society—to be an ac-
cepted part of the group.

Each individual, through self-gov-
ernment, must choose which desire
will predominate. According to Mr.
Lear, only the choice of the first
desire will truly satiate his questions.
After the choice is made, the indi-
vidual should devote his actions
toward peace-making, in short, fol-
low Gandhi who is the model of the
almost perfect pacifist.

SPORTS

The Best Sports News On Campus

By MIKE NATION

This is the last transitory week
from winter to spring sports. This
is the last week that almost nothing
newsworthy happens. The week af-
ter vacation the indoor sports par-
ticipants start their outdoor season
in earnest up Liberty Hall direction
and out Goshen way.

The search for news at Doremus
turned up nothing except people out
of town. Coach Mac and Coach
Leslie are in Atlantic City at some
sort of football convention. Coach
Eastman is somewhere else.

The Rumor’s True

The rumor circulating that W&L
has accepted a 243 pounder in the
class of 1970 has been confirmed by
Dean Farrar. His name is Crigler
of Randolph-Macon Academy. He
plays football and wrestles heavy-
weight, which should go down as
one of the more astute observations
of the day.

Tennis Rebuilding

The tennis team under Coach
Canfield faces a major rebuilding
this year. Everyone is gone from last
year’s varsity except number three
man Forrest Dickinson and number
six man Phil Thompson. Gone are
top four year men like Jim (Gover-
nor) DeYoung and Randy Jones.

The team has only
courts for a little over a week, the
black top courts as well, for the
others are being repaired. It’s too
early to tell who’s going to be play-
ing in what position.

On the other hand Canfield said
this never will be permanently de-
cided. He considers this good for he
feels that the strong competition for
the berth on the team will make
for better tennis all around.

Besides Thompson and Dickinson,
who will serve this year as captain,
Canfield cited freshman Tom Rueger
and Don McClure, and sophomores
Wick Vellines and Jones Beenes, up
from last year’s freshman squad, as
early outstanding performers.

Rough Schedule

The coach indicated that W&L
would be taking on this year a truly
big time schedule. The team is slat-
ed to meet the likes of West Vir-

been on the

Canfield stated that the attempt is
in the direction of creating one of
the better tennis program in the
state.

Washington and Lee opens its sea-
son on April 5, against Grove City,
here.

Freshman Lacrosse Coach

In keeping with the practice of
past few years, a one time under-
grad who is now a law student will
coach freshman lacrosse. Carroll
Klingelhofer, last year’s stand out
attack man, has been assigned the
task of leading this year’s Brigadiers,
a large portion of which have never
as much as laid eyes on a stick.

Last year Klingie, as one of the
tri-captains, led the team in scoring
and in assists. He scored 26 goals
himself and aided on 25 others. All-

division honors were his for two
years running.
Klingie’s inexperienced stickmen

get their first test April 8, against
Augusta Military Academy on Wil-
son field.

A Tradition Falls

Another fine old Washington and
Lee tradition goes down the drain
this spring vacation. Baseball coach
Joe Lyles has called off the annual
spring vacation march through the
Carolinas for the baseball team.
As Lyles explains elsewhere on this
page, he hopes that this deletion
from the schedule will attract those
boys who prefer Nassau to South
Carolina army bases to give base-
ball a whirl.

 

 

Baseball Team Practices;
Spring Outing Is No More

Baseball coach Joe Lyles is ex-
perimenting this year in an attempt
to build up W&L’s baseball fortunes.
The varsity is not making their usual
Spring trip this year.

Coach Lyles explained his idea
this way. “I hope that by cancelling
the trip over vacation we would
have better and more boys try out
for the squad. In previous years
there have been many boys who did
not play because they had other
plans for their Spring break.

I don’t know yet how well this
idea will work out,” continued
Lyles,” we will have to wait until
the season gets started. The handi-
cap in not having the trip is that
we loose a full week of training. We
are ready to play right now, but af-
ter next week’s layoff I’m not sure
how we will do.”

Two Days to Get Ready

The varsity will have only two
days to prepare a game with Bridge-
water, here, on Wednesday after va-
cation. On the eighth the squad plays
at Old Dominion. Both of these teams
will have practice during the Spring
break.

“Whether the boys will be ready
depends on their maturity,” stated
Lyles. “By maturity I mean, are the
boys able to handle the pressure of

varsity competition? We have fresh-
men on the squad and much will
depend on whether they can men-
tally handle starting roles.”

To lead the freshman coach Lyles
has nine upperclass lettermen, They
are: infilders. Ed Bishop, Fred Cros-
land, Eric Sisler, and Dave Kirpat-
rick; catchers, Skip Jacobsen, and
Guy Townley; and pitchers, Pete
Hueman, Jim Cooper, and Bill Ras-
mussen.

Defense

“These boys and the freshmen will
have to play good defense if we
are to win. I want to make all the
automatic outs. That is we can’t af-
ford errors on the easy grounders
and pop flies. In the past we have
been weak defensively but I want
to develop a balance between good
defense and good offense,” explained
Lyles.

Coach Lyles believes his catchers
will help a group of young pitchers
develop. “We have the best catchers
I've seen in seven years. Besides
Jasobsen and Townley, we have
freshmen catchers John Wolf and
Ed Mitchell.
