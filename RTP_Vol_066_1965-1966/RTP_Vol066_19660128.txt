Traditional Ball
Threatened By

Low Attendance

By MAURICE FLIESS
Executive Editor
Fancy Dress, after a long
and distinguished history as the
South’s outstanding collegiate
social event, may be going to
the dogs.

The _ traditional
break weekend will remain, un-
doubtedly, but administration and
university dance board personnel are
saying the future of the ball itself
may depend upon attendance at
tonight’s 59th annual dance.

They are watching the situation
closely, on two fronts.

One will be Evans Hall, where
since 1962 the dance has been held.
The second will be the Moose Lodge,
where a combo party is being spon-
sored by a law student and 1965
graduate of Washington and Lee.

The two functions conflict time-
wise.

There have been off-campus par-
ties on the Friday night of Fancy
Dress in years past, but none so
widely advertised as tonight's.

semester

Some associated with Fancy Dress
fear that a number of students after
learning of the $3-per-couple combo
party where drinking is allowed may
have decided against paying twice
that much for rented costumes to
wear to the ball tonight, where
drinking is not permitted.

Others, Fancy Dress vice presi-
dents and dance board members
among them, believe the usual 500
or so couples will crowd the floor
in Evans Hall tonight from 9 to 1
to dance to the music of Stan Rubin's
Orchestra

In recent years, university -spon-
sored dances have pulled a disap-
pearing act.

The Friday dance of Springs has
been converted into a concert to
match the Saturday concert.

Rufus Thomas
Entertains At
Cocktail Party

The 59th annual Fancy
Dress Weekend officially be-
gins this afternoon with the
university cocktail party at
“Walking the
Dog” Rufus Thomas and his
combo will entertain students
and their dates, as they sip
mint juleps.

Rufus Thomas, Nashville disk-
jockey, is the originator of the “dog”
and was propelled to fame with hit
songs like “The Dog,” “Walking the
Dog,” “Can Your Monkey do the
Dog,” and “Jump Back.”

The Fancy Dress Ball itself starts
tonight at nine, with President Joe
Miller and his escort leading the fig-
ure on the floor of Evans Dining
Hall. Following Miller will be vice-
presidents Tersh Baker, John An-
thony, Scott Miller, John Ruther-
ford, Larry Craig, Jeff Novinger, and
Roy Tyler. Also in the figure will
be the eighteen fraternity presidents
and the president of the Dance
Board.

At 9:40, Stan Rubin and his Or-
chestra will strike up dance music,
and the ball will be underway. Stu-
dents and their dates will be in for-
mal attire, or wearing costumes ap-
propriate to the “Derby Day” theme
of the ball. Costumes will include
jockeys, gamblers, Kentucky colo-
nels, and Southern gentlemen

Stan Rubin, returning to W&L
alter last year’s performance at
Fancy Dress, leads one of the most
successful dance bands in the coun-
try. His two-in-one combination of
orchestra and Tigertown Five is
heavily sought after for college func-
tions, cotillions, and debutante par-
ties.

| The Best Laid Plans...

’Tis the end of exams... the season of Fancy Dress. And
how do we find the average Washington and Lee gentleman?
Besides being “crude” and “slovenly” as the Wahoos see him,

he is alone, all alone, ‘‘an Iland, intire of it selfe.”’

Planning for this fifty-ninth Fancy Dress weekend began
early in the fall as President Joe Miller and the Dance Board
scheduled a great variety of entertainment suited to the tastes
of all W&L students. Slated to appear are Rufus Thomas in
the pop-r&b field, Stan Rubin, a perennial Dance Board favor-
ite, for the Dixieland fans, Ian and Sylvia, the best of folk, and
Nina Simone, jazz stylist extraordinaire.

To do their part W&L students always try to come up
with particularly good dates. Therefore, out came the black
book for western Virginia’s Fast Moving Five.

As good planning would have it, Hollins and Sweet Briar,
the second homes of the “stud,’”’ conveniently scheduled their
exams to conflict with “the South’s outstanding collegiate
social event.”

Curfew hours for Sem girls have been liberalized for W&L
big weekends, but Sem is still Sem. Three down.

The intellectual Mink likes to feel smarter than his date.
Scratch Macon; four down.

And what self-respecting W&L “hoss” wants to date “‘the
girl next door” for Fancy Dress? Exit Mary Baldwin.

Local talent being what it is, obvious choice becomes the
girl back home. But unfortunately, that is where she still is.

She is still there because Old Man Winter is ‘dumping’

degree. Woodrum Field looks more like the Homestead every
hour, and even the bears won’t come out of Weyer’s Cave.

But the weekend offers too much to punt completely, so,
instead of finessing it, have a ball, even if snow cones must re-
place mint juleps as drink-of-the-week.

A Midwinter Night's Dream

 

Mrs. Miller Sets Fancy Dress Spirit
With Professional Dance Decorations

Washington and Lee students will
have professional help—free for
nothing—in designing the decorations
for their 57th annual Fancy Dress
Ball Friday night.

The students were assured of that
last year when they elected senior
Joseph G. Miller of Nashville, Tenn.,
as Fancy Dress President. Miller’s
mother, Mrs. W. F. Miller, is a pro-
fessional set designer, working with
both the Children’s Theater and the
Circle Theater in Nashville.

Mrs. Miller recently spent several
days in Lexington looking over
Evans Dining Hall, where the Ball-
one of the South’s oldest and lead-
ing social events—will be held, and
in helping her son and members of
his committee design the dance dec-
orations.

The theme is “Derby Day,” and
every effort has been made to capture
an authentic reproduction of the
Kentucky Derby. Miller and several

snow on our rustic setting to an unprecedented and intolerable Editor and FD Committee)

Gentlemen:

I was somewhat taken back to read
Mr. Cannon’s editorial concerning
ipathy toward Fancy Dress Weekend
in the January 7, 1966, issue of the

| Ring-tum Phi. Obviously, Mr. Can-

non or whoever wrote the editorial
did not attend Fancy Dress himself
year, or he would not have
made the not so astute statements
which he made concerning this year’s
lag in enthusiasm.

Last year, around 250 costumes
were sold and over 100 more impro-
vised, providing for a very high
turnout for recent years. Studdism
and snobbery apparently didn’t inhi-
bit the turnout at all—conversely,
that faction was well represented
at the 1965 Fancy Dress Ball. This
in itself refutes the editor’s thesis
that W&L students are fearing for
their “stud image rating” by going
to the traditional FD ball

I think that an important
for this year’s apathy, which in this
instance appears to be a real prob-
lem, is that via this year’s selection
of Vice-Presidents for the Weekend,
Fancy Dress appears to be a Delta
Tau Delta function rather than a
and Lee University
function. This struck me as soon as
I read the issue announcing that 6
of the 8 VP's were selected from one
fraternity

On the other hand, the VP's for the
1965 Fancy Dress Weekend repre-
sented four different fraternities and
the Non-Fraternity Union, Could this
difference? I think

Sincerely,

DICK KREITLER,

Editor's Note: Never let it be
said that Dick Kreitler ever threw
a party for anybody but studs, It
would ruin his image.

With this, Mrs. Miller has created

bandstand and simulate the Derby
track, complete with a seven-foot
high horse and jockey, finish line,

In addition, huge banners in the

scheme, tiled floor and grandiose
brass and crystal chandeliers, is in
itself a magnificent setting for the
Ball.

“The dining hall is just beautiful,”
Mrs. Miller said, “and really needs
little additional decoration anyway.”

One drawback which had to be
overcome: Because the Ball is in a
dining hall, none of the decorations
could be nailed or pasted to the
walls, floor or ceiling. Mrs. Miller
simply designed a large framework
of two-by-fours which will serve as
the bandstand and to which the dec-
orations can be attached.

 

The framework can be reused for
future Fancy Dress Balls.

Costumes for the Derby Day Ball
will include jockey suits, gambler’s

outfits, Kentucky Colonels and
Southern gentlemen topped off by
silk hats and bowlers. University
students will wear the costumes.

Their dates will wear formal dresses.

President Miller and the 26 student
officers of the dance will be decked
out in white tie and tails. They will
lead the figure which gets the Ball
underway at 9 p.m. Miller will es-
cort Miss Sandra Shelton of Nash-
ville, a student at Vanderbilt.

Campus Memories, Musings, Predictions

By KAZ HERCHOLD
Assistant Managing Editor

As another semester comes to its
tearful end, let's reflect for a mo-
ment upon all the people and event

who shook, nauseated, bored, or
irked that much maligned mass of
humanity known as the W&L stu-
dent body.

First there were the campus pun-
dits whose cogent and unerringly

perceptive additions to the arsenal of
student philosophy served only to
fill pages of the Ring-tum Phi and
then perhaps to illuminate the dark
their own minds

Sports Reach Moose Lodge

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, W&L is really getting sporty
this weekend, that is Sunday at the
Moose Lodge. Who
are the sportiest
just outside of
Lexington (they’re
just outside be-
cause they’ve al-
ready been ban-
ned inside)? Ob-
viously Doug
Clark and his
boys, better
known as the “Hot
Nuts.”

It has been a
long time since this famous, or in-
famous, group has been around W&L
and what a weekend to return! Just
once before I die I'd like to see a
Fancy Dress without snow, a Fancy
Dress costume without galoshes, a
Fancy Dress ball without a snow-
ball.

Would you believe that it has
snowed for the last 20 Fancy Dress-
es? Well, would you believe the
last 7? You had better, because that’s
what it is.

The fly boys are already planning
to schedule a shut down of the air-
ports during next year’s F.D. for
an extra holiday. All they'll need
is someone to tend the phone and
say, “sorry, but there just ain’t noth-
in’ comin’ or goin’” in a thick Ap-
palachian accent. They already know
that it will snow.

I'm beginning to think that the
weatherman is a Wahoo. Why else
does it snow for, or rather on, us
and not on them? Somebody some-
where is plotting to keep good W&L
men from their dates, and they've
made a damn good start.

 

Bensinger

Inside joke of the week—the ru-
mor that Paul Brown would be

the next coach of the Washington
Redskins. What is so funny that his
old quarterback, Otto Graham, got
the job. If Brown won't do, maybe
an ex-Brown will.

If Otto is half as good a pro coach
as he was a pro QB, the rest of the
league had better look out; the Skins
could finish up where they're pick-
ed one of these years.

I got finished with exams (or vice-

man (and I really did try—three
times, even in this weather) were in

I'll pick Sigma Nu.

Bridgewater
Tops Brigadiers

The first game of the season saw
the Washington and Lee freshman
basketball team lose to Bridgewater
by a 70-45 score, but in the week
before exams the Little Generals
kept it close before finally falling 71-
62.

Larry Boetsch was the high scorer
for the freshman team with 16 points.
Lee McMillan, Greg Crampton, and
Richard Lohrman followed with 9
points each.

As Coach Joe Lyles put it, “There
has been vast improvement made.
But the trouble remains in the prac-
tices. There are only ten boys on the
team, and an average of three or
four have labs each day. As a result,
we can’t work on defense or presses,
or even pattern basketball to any
great extent. Our floor play, which
is the key to a winning team, has
suffered greatly.”

NOTICE

Coach Norris Eastman has an-
nounced that his swimming team will
hold practice at 12:30 p.m. on Sun-

 

day.

The second half was even tighter
as R.P.I. made several runs at the
Generals in the last five minutes,
only to have each one turned aside.
At 57-57 and with only six seconds
remaining, Jody Kline sank two free
throws to mark the margin of vic-

the tenacious defense, the

the balanced scoring. Following Mor-

ars and their research efforts with
the magnitude, extent and depth of
its holdings. And professors contin-
ued to assign the same paper topics
to groups of at least thirty students,
gleefully insuring that the book rush
at McCormick would resemble naval
maneuvers in Death Valley. The
novel, a yet undiscovered literary
form at McCormick, never did quite
make the shelves. But then again,
reading hasn’t quite made the Wash-
ington and Lee gentleman’s extra-
academic hit parade either. The li-
brary staff, though, did decorate
the interior very nicely for Christ-
mas, stretching the horizons of the
aesthetic sense, capturing a little bit
of Christmas away from home for
the boys. Even that went largely un-
noticed.

The P.E. department, giving the lie
to extant rumors which questioned
its reality, defied established systems
of logic, positing its very own an-
swers to the burning issues of stu-
dent life. Yes, badminton was still a
prerequisite for handball, for who
after all could play handball without
knowing how to play badminton?
Well, the argument, which runs

tion that spastic segment of the stu-
dent body which never recovered
from last year’s P.F.I. tests. And then
to add to all the headaches at Dore-
mus, there was the football season.
The student body ought, neverthe-
less, to be commended for the re-
markable restraint with which it kept
a grip on the frustration of support-
ing only a partially successful team.
And the basketball team finally
showed signs of all the potential it
was reputed to possess, battling with
nationally ranked powers such as
David Lipscomb, Eastern Mennonite,

 

and Bridgewater.

Finally, the campus’ stimulating |
political life reached new heights of |
enlightenment as the Young Ameri- |
cans for Freedom surfaced from the |
depths of an enterprising young re-
actionary’s mind, to burst full blown
in the face of W&L’s already open-
minded brand of political activist.
Patriots screamed when the EC pro-

story as the Generals lost on the
boards, 60-37, for the first time this
year, and on the scoreboard, 92-68.
Upperman and Ellis led Bridgewater
with 31 and 22 points as the Eagles
hit 42.5 per cent from the field. The
Generals, led by Kline with 14 points
and Bauer and Edwards with 11, hit
on 45.8 per cent of their shots, but
the big difference was Bridgewater's
87 shots as W&L took only 59.

Eastern Mennonite

Washington and Lee’s first half
against Eastern Mennonite was 18
points below the previous night's
total as the halftime score was 50-26.
When it was all over the Generals,
hitting 46 per cent from the floor
and winning 36-34 on the boards,
won 93-71, as all eleven varsity
members scored.

The first half spurt was led by
Steve Sweitzer, the game’s leading
rebounder, who in the first twenty
minutes scored 15 of his 17 points,
and by Rob Bauer, who had 14 of 22
before halftime. John Carrere added

continue sacrificing them in Viet-

while, dangerous underground ele-
ment that they are, continued to hold
meetings in secret, rousing fears of
an imminent insurrection. Polls,
elections, and opinions samplings

managed only to explore the pre-
judices of approximately fifty per
cent of the student body, giving birth
to the hypothesis that perhaps only
fifty per cent of the student body

was “amazed at the concept of a

Patrick Healy is Executive Direc-
tor of the National League of Cities.
This is a lobbying group for a coali-

Healy will talk about the role of the
Federal Government in helping the
nation’s cities. His address will be

Last year, CONTACT was held in

because of a heavy work load. The
symposium has therefore been
scheduled for the second weekend in

that a maximum number of students
will take advantage of the opportun-
ity the Symposium affords them.
There should be something of spe-
cific interest to each of the students
at Washington and Lee. The CON-
TACT Chairmen Phil Claxton and
Roger Sennott, have succeeded in
assuring that various CONTACT
programs will cover a variety of aca-
demic disciplines. The problems of
the city are of current interest, and
the certainty that the city’s problems
will increase in the future makes this
topic vitally important to the stu-
dents of today—the students that
will live in the city of tomorrow.

Rubin, Simone, Ian and Sylvia Highlight Fancy Dress

(Continued from page 1)
Fancy Dress will be significantly
altered, perhaps as soon as next year.

It all began in 1907 when Miss
Annie Jo White, the W&L librarian,
gave a costume party for her friends
in a room above McCrum’s Drug
Store. Students turned the private
party into a campus-wide function,
with Miss Annie directing each ball
until 1920 and attending each until
her death in 1938.

Featured twice in Life magazine,
and broadcast by the CBS radio net-

work in the past, Fancy Dress re-
ceived national recognition through
the years for the pageantry of such
themes as the Congress of Vienna
Ball, Arabian Nights, Sherwood For-
est, Shakespeare in the Court of
King James I, Mardi Gras, Civil War
Centennial, and—in 1965—Showboat.

In 1940, the theme was much like
this year’s “Derby Day.” It was an
authentic reproduction of the first
Kentucky Derby party in the gar-
dens of Federal Hill at Louisville in

 

1875.
