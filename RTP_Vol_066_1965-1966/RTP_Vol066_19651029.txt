this year will be concerned with

“The American City.” It is the feel-

to a large extent, on the manner in
which its urban problems met

bate than any other topic this fall. However, for observers
close to the University, the lack of issues for discussion so far
this year is alarming.

This was to be the year of the “progressive” Executive
Committee, a rejuvenated Interfraternity Council, an inquisi-
tive Self-Study Committee, an exciting Class of 69. Something
is missing, however. Gone are the days of the “issue-makers’”—
the Lamar Lamb’s, the Steve Smith’s, and the Tracy Harring-
ton’s.

For quite some time, students have
complained bitterly about having
to go to classes on Saturday morn-

answered definitely at this time.
There are many possibilities of new
schedule workings. The planning

would take a great deal of time—so

much time, in fact, that if the de-
cision to abolish Saturday classes
were reached, a_ five-day week

reached, a five-day week would not
go into effect until next year or pos-
sibly even the year after.
Five-day Week Suggestions
It is safe to assume, however, that
much of the following would be in-
volved in a five-day week.

1. Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday clas-
ses might be extended to an hour
and a half, and be held only on
Tuesday and Thursday. This means
that students would go to classes
on Tuesday and Thursday up un-
til four or five o’clock in the af-
ternoon. There is also a possibility
that some students would have
classes in the afternoon on Mon-
day-Wednesday-Friday, but it
probable the M-W-F classes would
remain the same as now, depend-
ing on what the students
take and when they meet.

2.There is a possibility that some
classes would meet only two hours
a week and consequently only two
hours’ credit would given.
Likewise, some classes might meet
five hours a week, etc. This, how-
ever, is highly improbable.

morning.

noon until one o’clock. This hour
would be for all students and the
staggered lunch system would be
eliminated.

Of course, these changes are not
definite. No schedule changes can be
worked out until the type of system
that is chosen can be itself worked
out. But these changes do give one
an idea of the kind of things that

can be expected from a five-day
week.

Advantages
There are, of course, advantages |?

and disadvantages concerning a five-
day week. Some of the advantages
are as follows.

poorly attended. Saturday morn-

student or professor has a
great deal of research work to do,
he may use Saturday morning to
do it. He can easily travel to the
University of Virginia or to any
other school to make use of their
facilities.

.Many students would concentrate

and study harder during the week
knowing that they have a day off
at the end of the week. As it is
now, students have only Saturday
afternoon and night off. On Sun-
day, students must begin prepar-
ing for Monday.

no Saturday classes, our athletes
would not have to miss classes in
order to participate in sports.

on the subject of
sports, as far as getting to foot-
ball games, the six-day week is
close to ridiculous. For the student
who gets out of class at one
o'clock, running to his room, tak-
ing a shower, eating a quick lunch,
and probably having to pick up his
date, getting to the game at two
o'clock impossible. No doubt,

25-year A ward |

Two men associated with Wash-
ington and Lee University have been
honored with nominations from their
alma maters for this year’s Sports
Illustrated Silver Anniversary All-
American Awards.

A. T. Bishop, Jr., a 1941 graduate
of Washington and Lee, and Lee M.
McLaughlin, a graduate of the Uni-
versity of Virginia of the same year,
are among 64 candidates—all cited
for their exceptional success in life
25 years since their senior collegiate
football season of 1940.

Bishop was an »utstanding full-
back for Washington and Lee and
earned three varsity letters at that
position. While studying at the Uni-
versity, he was chosen for member-
ship in Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron
Delta Kappa, national honorary aca-
demic and leadership societies, re-
spectively, and Beta Gamma Sigma,
national honorary commerce society.
He also served as president of Al-
pha Tau Omega, national social
fraternity.

All-State

McLaughlin won All-State honors
while at the University of Virginia
and subsequently played a year of
professional football with the Green
Bay Packers. He then served with
the United States Navy as a com-
mander of a minesweeper which par-
ticipated in all the major invasions
of the southern European theater.

'

After ten years of high school
coaching at Episcopal High School in
Alexandria, McLaughlin undertook

the rebuilding of Washington and
Lee's football program in 1957. Serv-

At Bridgewater

The Washington and Lee eleven
| will seek its second victory of the
| season this Saturday at Bridgewater,
| hoping to improve on a disappointing
|showing against Western Maryland

|last weekend. Bridgewater, a 56-6

victim of Guilford, has won only
2 games thus far. On paper a lack-
luster opponent for the Generals,

Bridgewater has given their oppon-
ents’ offenses fits with a stout ground
defense and hopes to do the same

against W&L.

| The Eagles lost to Hampden-Syd-
| ney, Randolph-Macon, and Guilford
by overwhelming scores, but these
point margins are not a true indica-
tion of their strength a team.
The defense utilizes a 4-4 formation,
with four men on the forward wall
and four linebackers, thus making it
tough to move against them on the
| ground. Bill Duke, a guard on the

Tomorrow

Eagle defense has leaked a goodly
number of touchdowns to the oppo-
sition, many of those points can be
credited to an offense that has lost
the ball deep in its own territory.
Frequently interceptions have been
run back for touchdowns.

Bridgewater’s offense usually
doesn’t go. Quarterback Butch Mar-
vel, number 19, paces their many
variations of T formation, with a
widely split line and flanking ends
and halfbacks. An outstanding half-
back in the person of Yeager Marks
leads the ground gaining attack,
Marvel handles the passing. He
sticks mainly to the short “look-in”
passes but is capable of throwing the
bomb occasionally. His top receiver
is Bob Baker, an end with an ex-
tremely good pair of hands.

In opposing Bridgewater this week,
W&L plans to play 60 minutes of
dedicated football in an attempt to
eliminate the erratic football played

William Shakespeare’s undiscovered epic, “Queen Alexandra
and Murray;’ was unearthed a few years ago by a man who
claimed to be 2,000 years old, Passages were quoted, and
scholars were sent to work. Subsequently, the Onomotopaeiac
Society of America camped on the site of a Renaissance
street theatre, and while digging the scene, a ghostly figure
emerged.

It spoke in a voice not unlike Margaret Rutherford’s saying:
“What ho, students! Get ye to a nvsrchant who peddles ye
olde phonographe discs. Find ye my picture, and hold it next
thy books. Fame and fortune wait without!”

Or—why don’t you pop for some pop art book covers? Avail-
able at your friendly record peddler’s shoppe!

(And, unless you're a loser, you'll! check out the lineup
of Capitol records, too! That means the Beatles, The
Beach Boys, The Lettermen, The Seekers and so on!)
