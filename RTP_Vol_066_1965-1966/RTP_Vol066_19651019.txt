 

W&L Defeats Guilford in Tight Game

By CHARLIE FRERET

Victory was snatched from the
jaws of defeat Saturday as the un-
derrated Generals of Washington and
came from behind with less than
two minutes to go to whip Guilford
College of North Carolina, 26-20, be-
fore a jubilant homecoming crowd.

Before the crowd had gotten set-
tled, Guilford had put the first points
of the game on the scoreboard on
an eight yard pass from Bill Bur-
chette to halfback Tommy Grayson,
followed by Grayson’s conversion.
The next time Guilford gained pos-
session of the football the Quakers
crossed the goalline again, and again
it was Burchette passing to Grayson,
this time for 45 yards for the touch-
down, Grayson added the extra point
to provide a 14-0 margin.

Washington and Lee could not
sustain a march and was forced to
punt again. Burchette took charge
and drove the Quakers downfield,
climaxing the drive by scoring on a
two yard plunge to up the score to
20-0. Meanwhile the Generals were
finding the going tough against the
big Guilford defense and could sree!

Then a play occurred which was
to be lucky for W&lL and unlucky
for Guilford. A Burchette pass to
Henry MeKay was good for 39 yards,
but McKay dropped the ball on the
29 when hit. The ball took a Guil-
ford bounce and landed in the hands
of Quaker end Tommy Lovell who
sped the remaining yards for an ap-

parent seore and a 26-0 lead. Here
the crowd sensed a rout, but Lady

showed her blessings to
Generals as Guilford was penal-
ized for holding. Unable to advance,
Guilford forced to punt and
W&L took over. Bryant Kendrick,
starting his second game at
quarterback, got the Generals mov-
ing. Reaching the Guilford 32 yard
line, the Generals found their drive
momentarily stopped, but off the
bench came third string quarterback
Andy Bloom to loft a pass to end
Rob Reading to put the Generals on
the scoreboard. The half ended with
Guilford in front, 20-6.

Conceding that politic as present-

permanently dissolved itself. The
nine member fraternities declared
their intention to explore possibili-

Dormant Since “Big Four”

The University Party declined to
nominate candidates in last Spring’s

judice it was assumed had been built
up against the Party during the
“Big Four” election. It was the only
party to nominate candidates for
the “Big Four” last term; the Lib-
berty and Progressive Parties went
by default

Agreement was reached at last
week's meeting on a proposal to
make an extensive study of parti
and polities on other campuses with
an eye toward adopting certain fea-

Homecoming Game 1965: Well Done!

It seems only appropriate, indeed mandatory, to extend
congratulations to the football team for their spectacular per-
formance on Saturday. The Generals displayed the kind of
dogged determination which has always been characteristic of
our teams over the years. Saturday’s game provided one of
those rare opportunities to witness a surge of school spirit on a
grand scale.

It would be impossible to single out any one player as the
key to the victory. Quite obviously, the momentum for the
second half rally was a product of an all out team effort. In
light of the wanning spirit of both the players and the student
body, prior to this weekend, the result is even more incredible.

School spirit is a perennial problem which has plagued
this campus for a number of years. Since the end of “big time”
football at Washington and Lee in 1955, there has been a de-
cline in attendance and interest among a growing number of
students. It is easy to see the origin of this problem and the
manner in which it is perpetuated—the solution is quite an-
other thing.

The spirit and enthusiasm which was evident on Saturday
was a breath of fresh air in the often apathetic atmosphere of
our campus. Attendance at the game was well over that of the
previous week, although not nearly as large as it should be. Per-
haps the most encourageing sign of the afternoon was the
genuine determination of both the team and the spectators to
stick it out until the end.

In an attempt to combat this apathetic trend the Varsity
Club two years ago instituted the Sem cheerleaders and the
special cheering section in the stands. Although we still have
the Sem girls, the cheering section seems to have been dis-
carded. We would suggest that the Varsity Club encourage this
activity during the next home games.

The remaining two home games will afford ample oppor-
tunity fo reach student to maintain the spirit of this past week.
Certainly, the football team deserves this minimal effort on our
part, and more important school spirit in itself is healthy and
valuable,

Regardless of the outcome of this season we are confident
that our team will continue to display the spirit of Homecom-
ings. The crucial question now is whether the student body can
offer even more support than in the recent past. We owe at
least this much to ourselves,

As I was sitting upon our fair
campus the other day counting dogs,
I marveled at the splendid organiza-
tion we have at Washington and Lee
(it’s beautiful here in the fall, isn’t
it, with the golden leaves drifting
slowly down through the misty haze
of a sleepy October afternoon—I’m
not really a nature-boy but I needed
twenty-four more words) that (or
maybe which) allows us to have so
many wonderful activities all on one
single weekend.

We have just wended our way

Openings and Homecomings, and we
all certainly had the grandest of

But do we realize what is happen-

long view, the overall standpoint?
What is really going on, my friends,
is that slowly, inch by inch and year

ever they are—they may not know
themselves) are consolidating and
combining activities so that eventual-
ly we will have One Big Weekend—

An Ideal System

 

Overcrowding In Upper Courses
Detracts From Seminar Approach

By NICK RUFFIN

Washington and Lee is one of those
institutions which are commonly de-
scribed as small, men’s liberal arts
colleges. The advantages of a col-
lege of this type are that the school
is small enough so that one depart-
ment knows that another depart-
ment exists, that the professors in
these departments are in contact
with each other, and that they can
maintain an awareness and attitude
toward education that transcends the
limits of one’s particular field.

As the catalogue says, “because of
Washington and Lee’s emphasis upon
undergraduate education, its faculty
is essentially a body of highly quali-
fied, highly trained men whose first
interest and first responsibility is
teaching.”

A Diploma Factory

At Washington and Lee the stu-
dent should feel that he is more
than just another body in a diplo-
ma factory. The professors are acces-
sable to and interested in the stu-
dent. The student finds he is part of
a community whose collective goal is
liberal education. (For some of you
political conservatives, a liberal edu-

this “independent  entity”—South
Vietnam. It is obvious that Mr.
Awad’s conception of independence
differs radically from mine. I have
always interpreted independence as
implying “national sovereignty,” the
competence of a regime to imple-
ment policy decisions free of foreign
dictation.

In my estimation, South Vietnam
is as independent of Washington as
Hungary is of Moscow. The present
leaders of South Vietnam give oc-
easional pretense of independence,

self-delusion. South Veitnam is

Mr. Awad states that the United

bound to honor a pledge we have

I might ask: What pledge? As Hans
Morganthau has so aptly pointed
out—The only contract we have to
honor is the one we made with our-
selves. The government to which
this pledge was made was one of our
own creation; it was not a govern-
ment elected and supported by the
people of South Vietnam.

I only wonder what happened to
this great passion for human liber-
ty, which we so sanctimoniously
espoused, during the years from 1954
to the present in South Vietnam.
Was our concern for the develop-
ment of a viable democracy in South
Vietnam, or was it with the deter-
mination of retaining an effective
bulwark against communist imperial-
ism in Southwest Asia? Was our ex-
uberance over the deposition of Pres-
ident Diem in 1963 a manifestation
of our commitment to individual
liberty, or was it because we rec-

The low faculty to student ratio
at Washington and Lee would lead
one to believe that the effectiveness

the student, in which he hangs on
by his teeth during the week in order
to escape into weekendly bliss. Who
knows? In years to come the Library
might even stay open on Saturday
night.

Let us look, then to the future, to
see where the present trend of few-
er Big Weekends is taking us.

Life in 1975

The year is nineteen seventy-five.
It is Friday morning, the start of
W&L’s One Big Weekend. Fresh-
men are given name tags and sent
to Freshman Camp. As they travel
on the bus, they are given their
placement examinations.

Once at Natural Bridge they are
rushed by fraternities and they
pledge after lunch. On their way
back to Lexington—the same day,
remember—they register with their
advisors and pay their tuition and
get to know their dorm counsellors.

Meanwhile, back at the U., Open-
ings has begun in the Dining Hall.

sembly is held while parents regis-
ter for Parents’ Weekend.

ior Banquet and Alumni Dinner)

larger colleges with higher ratios.
Our professors are live when they
lecture, not on television, They know
us by name and face, not as seat 26.

An Ideal System

Our system sounds ideal, but is it
really? What we have at W&L are
numerous medium sized classes, a
few small, seminar-sized classes, and
a very few large classes. Most pro-
fessors have structured their courses
to be presented to medium or small
classes, of five to fifteen or twenty
students. This structure applies par-
ticularly to upper level courses and
not as much to those on the fresh-
man or introductory level.

The system appears to break down,
though, when the number in a class
rises to be twenty-five, thirty or
above. A middle-sized or small class
appears to become overcrowded and
ineffective at this level of size. The
class itself is not too large to be
handled effectively, but it is too large
to be handled effectively if the ap-
proach is that applicable to a small
class.

As a senior, | am in four courses
above the 200 level which seem to
suffer because they are too large
for the approach being taken. I have
been told of one class that is so large
this year that students have actual-
ly been assigned numbers to expe-
dite taking roll. If names were called
there would be no time for class.
(The solution to this is not to have
a roll, but that is another question.)
The problem is actually not one of
overcrowding but of overloading.

The most obvious solution to the
problem is to expand certain depart-
ments. I suppose that every depart-
ment thinks it needs more men to
lighten the load. Some appear to be
in greater need than others: but to
avoid being hanged in effigy by the
faculty in those not mentioned, I
shall name no names.

This is not to say that one field is
more important than another, but as
a college such as this the students’
free choice of courses should have
some effect on the size of other de-
partments. There is a problem in
trying to match trends; a course
may be crowded one year and go
begging the next. At the same time,
there are some perennial losers.

Another solution would seem to be

the middle-sized class. Does it not
have the faults of a large class with-
out the benefits of a small one? When

In Washington Hall there is a

This sign, now turned brown

this sign has been viewed with ap-
prehension and fear by the stu-
dents of this university, New it has
become necessary to speak against
the eruel injustice of this agent of
totalitarian coercion.

The sign reads, for these of you
whe have not seen it, “Please Use
Payne Hall entrance.”

The message that the sign conveys
is actually not worthy of protest per
se, but one must think for a moment
just what this sign means and how
it is enforced

First of all, what does it mean’
lt means that students are to use
the Payne Hall entrance when en-
tering the Registrar's Office (Duh!).

takes a break, the Phi Beta Kappa
Convocation is convoked. After lunch

make this the first time. They didn’t.

The second half saw the tables re-
versed. The Generals penetrated
Guilford’s 10-yard line five times,
the first two times resulting in frus-
tration. Despite this they went on
to score three times in the final per-
iod.

It appears that the award for the
outstanding player at Homecomings
will again be given to the whole
team. To do otherwise would be
to commit an unpardonable sin.

Winning Tradiiion

The Generals have not been beat-
en at Homecomings in six years. The
last two years have seen them on
the long end of upsets of major pro-
portions. Last year it was Sewanee
who was previously unbeaten in
fourteen games.

A visit to the Delt house Satur-
day night proved most entertaining.
Certainly their new facility is the
best around for the combo sort of

Tuesday S ports

B. S.

By TOM CARPENTER

 

Saturdays in Lexington this fall have been very unexciting, and last
Saturday appeared to be just like the previous ones. Guilford College of
North Carolina was coming in for the Generals’ Homecoming, and the
word was that the Alumni were not going to be in for much of a treat.
Most of them probably expected that the cocktail party at 5:00 would be
the only enjoyable event of the afternoon.

Things began well for the Generals as the won the toss and gained
five yards on the first play without loss of down and without quarterback
Bryant Kendrick ever touching the ball. But the offsides penalty assessed
against Guilford was just about the only factor against them in the first
half.

The Quaker quarterback Bill Burchette looked more like John Unitas
every play. With the first period half gone he hit Tom Grayson with a
swing pass that led to seven points. Early in the second period he pulled
the old Unitas trick of isolating a linebacker as the only pass defender
against a speedy halfback, who was in this case Grayson again. Result:
another six point play followed by another conversion.

General Mistake

Midway through this quarter the Generals made a strategic mistake.
They punted without warning Guilford and the quick kick was blocked
with Fred Gray recovering on the Generals’ 18 yard line. Trouble maker
Grayson took charge and scored in two plays, the second on a one-yard
plunge. But things began to look up for the Generals as the extra point
attempt failed.

W&L meanwhile was looking like the Washington Redskins on offense.
First down number one came with 4:35 remaining in the half.

Finally Coach Lee McLaughlin decided that it was time to unveil his
secret weapon that he obviously had been saving for this game. The Gen-
erals got the ball with very little time left in the half after Guilford’s
fourth touchdown was ruled illegal. Henry McKay took Burchette’s pass
for 39 yards and then decided he wanted to let someone else score the
touchdown. He fumbled on the W&L 29 yard line, and Tom Lovell picked it
up and went into the end zone. But a Guilford player was caught in the
nasty act of holding. He was probably very embarrassed that he was caught.

Bloom to Reading

Then it was that two men who were regarded as defensive special-
ists made their appearance on the scene. No one in the stands seemed
exceptionally excited when Andy Bloom (who?) went in at quarterback
and Rob Reading stepped in at end. Suddenly everyone was excited. With
20 seconds to go Bloom cocked his arm and unleashed a beautiful thing
called a touchdown pass which was accepted by Reading. Summary: 32
yard gain and six points.

As the teams prepared for the second half kickoff, it appeared that the
W&L fans decided that the most interesting thing thus far about Saturday
was the halftime entertainment provided by he Cave Springs High School
band. But a funny thing happened in the second half.

To begin with, Guilford made a mistake by coming out of the locker
room. The Quakers’ next mistake came when they fumbled in the vicinity
of one Billy Andrews who gradded said loose ball at the W&L 49.

The fans were horrified when the offensive unit appeared without the
now not-so-secret weapon. Reliable Bryant Kendrick was in charge, and
he decided to use the Generals’ ground game, i.e., John Anthony, with
aid from Tom Pittman. Drive one failed, but the defense took command
and halted Guilford quickly.

Craig Takes Charge

Larry Craig's punt return to the 35 of the visitors started the new drive.
The Generals reached the 5 and ran into trouble, known as lack of attack.
Coach McLaughlin reacted and tossed one half of his new weapon into the
game. Bloom reacted also by hitting Buddy Atkins with a pass for six
points. It looked like a Mutt-and-Jeff combination. The extra point at-
tempt was a farce as everyone decided to let the hike from center go un-
attached.

Later in the half Grayson—you remember him—decided to take matters
in his own hands and gave Guilford a more comfortable lead, but Craig
would have none of this as he halted Grayson’s 24-yard dash towards
the goal line with a last ditch shoe string tackle.

W&L took over, punted, and stopped Guilford. Craig again was in the
spotlight as he returned a punt 11 yards to the Guilford 37. With first
down on the 26, thanks to Anthony, Bloom resorted to his old tricks with
a new compatriot which resulted in a 25-yard pass play to Tersh Baker at
the one yard line. Baker sacrificed his health to make the catch and was
temporarily deactivated. Kendrick rushed in and carried the ball into the
end zone with 1:40 left in the game.

Bogart Ties Game

Next, Two “B” boys combined to execute the tying conversion. John
Bogart took the handoff and followed Jay “Booming” Bowersox's trap on
the right end for the needed two points. At this point the W&L fans were
overjoyed at the apparent tie game and were quite willing to call it a day,
but Coach MeLaughlin had other ideas.

Reading's kickoff was of the onside variety, and Bogart, who obviously
liked the role of hero, recovered on the Quaker’s 49. Bloom casually
ambled onte the field with one thought in mind, throwing the winning
touchdown pass. He started with an 8-yarder to Baker and then suffered
from a holding penalty. Bloom was not to be discouraged as he hit Read-
ing, his old buddy, for 28 yards to the 26. Baker took the next for 11 yards
to the 15. The tall, lanky New Yorker continued to fill the air with footballs,
but the next two fell unwanted. Then came the moment of truth for the
visitors as Reading eluded company except for the football and went into
the scoring zone untouched by human hands, making it, 26-20, with 46
seconds to play.

The Generals had scored twice in only 54 seconds, a feat that could
be called phenomenal if Minnesota had not scored twice in 22 seconds
against lowa on the same day

Guilford reached the General 47 as W&L yielded yardage willingly to
protect against the bomb. On the last play of the game Bubba Brockwell
unleashed the bomb only to find that his receiver on the seven yard line
was none other than W&L's Billy Andrews. At this point the W&L fans
left for the infirmary in search of cures for laryngitis, while the Guilford
fans just left.

Lyle’s Men Lose Third

 

By MOBY DOWLER

While W&L’s football team was
climaxing a great come-from-behind
victory over Guilford on Homecom-
ing Weekend, the General soccer
team was witnessing the same
achievement—but from a different
point of view. Consequently, the
Gobblers from Virginia Polytechnic
Instituted whittled away at an early
3-0 lead by Washington and Lee and
eventually triumphed in the second
period of overtime play by a margin
of 4-3.

Starting strongly, W&L scored its
three goals in the first half of the
game. Senior co-captain Tim Henry
accounted for all three tallies. The
initial goal was scored on a fast
| break, while the other two were
/seored on a direct kick outside of
the penalty are and a well maneuv-
ered play with an assist by Dave
Kirkpatrick just before halftime.

The second half of the game was

 

 

Cross Country Team

try team was defeated for the first
time this season as Old Dominion

a cross-country meet. The extremely
strong Old Dominion team finished
seven runners before Bill Lowry was
able to reach the finish line.

completely dominated by the VPI
squad. The Gobblers’ hustle and ag-
gressive ball handling enabled them
to score three times and knot the
game into a tie. The final result
then was decided in the second
overtime period.

The first period of the overtime
was uneventful as neither team was
able to mount a successful offensive
and put a winning goal in the net.
During the second period, W&L was

 

called on a foul within the penalty
area which led to the victorious goal
by VPI on a direct kick. This loss
brought the Generals’ seasonal rec-
ord to 3-3,

Washington and Lee’s next game
will be against American University
in Washington, D.C., next Friday.
This shapes up as a revenge game
for the Generals because it was this
team that broke the W&L winning
streak of six last year.

 

Ray Zeltner Wins Football Contest

The Ring-tum Phi’s weekly foot-

than a qualified success, as the num-
ber of entries hit the century mark
for the second consecutive week.

There were three perfect ballots
received in the initial contest, but
as prizes go to only the top two
entries the tie-breakers meant the
difference. Kevin Earle, Bill Ras-

Brigaders Win
Second Game;

Connon Stars

By MARK AKER

Washington and Lee’s Brigaders
unleashed their Cannon, as they beat
a tough Greenbrier team, 13-0, last
Friday in Lexington. The Cannon,
whose first name is Dee, raced for
101 yards on 10 carries, including a
spectacular 65-yard touchdown run
with 5:59 left in the third quarter.

Scoreless Half

Cannon’s run broke up what had
primarily been a game of good sound
defense. In the scoreless first half,
W&L held Grenbrier to 16 yards
total offense. It was good hardhitting
defense with Britt McJunkin, Hank
Wilson, Jeb Brown, Haskell Dickin-
son, and Rein Fischer leading the
way.

Cannon’s TD

The second half started as if it
was going to more of the same until
Cannon’s touchdown. W&L’s second
score came just five minutes later as
McJunkin recovered a Grenbrier
fumble on the visitor’s 27. Eight
plays later quarterback Alan Tomlin
passed to halfback Worth Blackwell
for the score to make it 13-0.

Cannon and Kinney

For the most part W&L dominated
play with the running of Cannon and
Dick Kinney and the pass receiving
of Dickinson, Grenbrier’s only sus-
tained drive came late in the fourth
quarter as quarterback Don Paull
managed to move his team to the
W&L 11. However, a clipping penalty
and some rugged defense moved
Greenbrier back to the 33, where
the drive lost steam and died out.

2-1 Record

The victory left the Brigadiers
with a 2-1 record for the year. Fri-
day they travel to Fork Union Mil-
itary Academy in quest of their third
consequtive victory.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Columnist Lee Examines Aims In Vietnam

(Continued from page 2)
prosecute the war against the in-
digenous Viet Cong? Has our sub-
sequent support for the military
oligarchs in South Vietnam served
as demonstrable proof of our un-
wavering support of democratic in-
stitutions in Asia?

We might ask ourselves why we
have supported Franco in Spain,
Salezar in Portugal, Battista in Cuba
and the military oligarchs in South
America. Is it because of our com-
mitment to democratic ideals? We
might even question that nature of
our foreign aid. Has our economic
and military assistance to these na-
tions been intended to alleviate the
poverty of their people, or has it
been intended to perpetuate regimes
professedly anti-democratic, but
anti-communist?

Mr. Award states the people of
South Vietnam wish to be free. I
agree fully. They wish to be free
from the Viet Cong. They also wish
to be free from the Americans—free
to pursue their own future wherever
it takes them. We might ask our-
selves: “Who are the real victims
of the Vietnam War? Whose homes
are being bombed and put to fire?
Whose children are being killed and

 

maimed?” Who are these victims:
They are the very Vietnamese whom
we are committed to protect.

The only tyranny with which they
are famiilar is that of war, a relent-
less, brutal war which has never
ceased for a quarter of a century.
Mr. Awad suggests that we can
bring the war to a successful con-
clusion in two years. I’m afraid
that not even the most optimistic
member of the Johnson Administra-
tion entertains such hopes. And so
the malady will linger on, and its
victims will continue to be the
Vietnamese people.

We might ask ourselves: “What
is our aim in Vietnam?” Do we have
a purpose there? Is our aim total
victory over Communists? The John-
son Administration insists that it is
not. Our aim is to force the North
Vietnamese to the conference table
and achieve an “honorable settle-
ment.” It will not be, nor could it
be, a settlement that will insure the
continued independence of South
Vietnam. It will be a settlement that
will afford the United States an al-
ternative to a drastic loss of face.

But is this loss of prestige worth
the loss of perhaps several thou-
sands American lives? Is this vic-

 

Weekly Football Contest

tory, if it can be called that, worth
the complete destruction of a na-

'tion and its people? Do we have

the right to ask the Vietnamese peo-
ple to make further sacrifices that

| will enable us to escape the ignomiy

 

of “retreat”?

Let us heed the advice of Senator
Robert Kennedy. We cannot fight
the promise of a better life which
communism offers the people of
Asia with troops and guns. We must
offer an alternative that will prom-
ise a still better life for the peo-
ple of South Vietnam. We must not
any longer disguise our purpose in
Vietnam by such euphemisms as
“self-determination” and “individual
liberty.”

We are in South Vetnam because
the Johnson Administration believes
that our national interests are being
challenged, because our own defense
is inextricably tied to the perpetua-
tion of an anti-communist regime in
Saigon. And while I do not agree that
our national interest is dependent
upon the successful prosecution of
the war in Vietnam, it is essential
that we, nevertheless, agree on the
reason why we are in Vietnam in
the first place.

Research Fund, established in 1960
through a gift of more than $250,000
from the late Dr. Gustavus Benz
Capito of Charleston, W. Va., an
alumnus of the class of 1899. The
fund has been supplemented by other
gifts.

In virtually every case, the work
of the students and their level of
involvement is comparable with
that normally undertaken at the
graduate level in pursuit of ad-
vanced degrees. The close rela-
tionships of students and profes-
ssors is similar to that encountered
at the Ph.D. level in graduate
school,

“It is our belief at Washington and
Lee that we should make every ef-
fort to introduce students to the
intellectual stimulation of research
and investigate study at the earliest
possible times in their academic ca-
reers,” President Fred C. Cole has

At the Delts a date was introduced

that he is unaffiliated, to which the
young lady said; “Oh, I always
wanted to meet an independent stu-
dent and find out what one is really
like. They’re always described in
such strange terms.” It appears that
she was not disappointed.

The same young lady also inquired
as to the definition of the term, “liz-

Macon and she had read in the
Collegian that she and her follow
travelers were referred to in this
manner. (One does think that the
Collegian goes too far in that any-

trary to normal taste is not neces-
sarily humorous.)
