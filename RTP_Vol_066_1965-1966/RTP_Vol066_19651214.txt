Dean John To Conduct Student

Discussion On U niverstty Issues

By JOHN THEIMEYER
Assistant Dean of Students Lewis G. John, Self-study An-
alyst for student life, recently gave his report on the prelimi-
nary segment of the program. In the report he remarked that
each of the phases of student life have been subjected to
“criticism and questioning,” and that one subcommittee (on

social fraternities) has been formed.*—--——

Twelve Phases

The twelve phases of student life
under discussion are student govern-
ment, honor system, orientation and
counseling, student discipline, relig-
ious life, student publications, in-
tercollegiate and intramural athletics,
student health services, extra-class
physical activities, and extra-class
student activities.

In some cases recommendations
resulting from the study have al-
ready gone into effect. For example,
this year for the first time a student

affairs committee with four voting
student members has been created,
and is now in service. As other

proposals become appropriate they
will be incorporated into the system.

 

Dean Lewis G. John

Students had an opportunity to
participate in the discusion of this
preliminary report this afternoon

these meetings and he will also be
available to discuss with individuals
the content of the report in his of-
fice from 2-4 p.m. on December 17

At a later date the subsommittee
fraternities will make its
report public. A summary on this
subject will be distributed, and ad-
ditional meetings scheduled for
open discussion

Improvement In

North Carolina

Freshman Chris Mills
Ranked Second At
Dixie Classic

By ALAN COOPER

The debate team enjoyed what
Coach William Chaffin termed its
“best tournament of the year” Dec.
9-11, winning four awards at the
10th annual Dixie Classic Debate
Tournament at Wake Forest in Wins-
ton-Salem, N. C.

The Washington and Lee negative
team in the four man _ division,
| George Dover and Chris Mills, won
seven of eight debates, the best rec-
| ord in the tournament, to be named
| best in that group. They then lost
to Canisius’ champions of the two
|man division in a playoff and took
| second place overall honors for the
tournament

Mills Second

Of the 96 debaters repsenting 27
| schools, Mills was chosen second best
speaker, and Jim Hammill was rank-
ed one of the top ten. Hamill
picked up another award by win-
ing a special extemporaneous speak -
ing event

Chaffin described the performance
as “very gratifying,” since it broke
a four-year Classic jinx in which
the team had not done well

Winning Record

The debate team has had a win-
ning record in all seven tourna-
ments in which it has participated,
bringing home eleven trophies and
six certificates.

The team has no more major de-
bates until it travels to Ohio State

string of eight tournaments on suc-

William Chaffin, English profes-

freshman team “amazing,” and

THE RING-TUM PHI

A Lament: Traditional Apathy

We are reluctant to report that the opening meetings for
students on the progress of the Self-Study Program are very
poorly attended. This is particularly distressing in light of prior
student expression which indicates considerable interest in these

discussions.

The various sub-committees of the Self-Study have spent
much time and effort in the production of preliminary reports
designed to represent the deliberations of these groups, and to
give interested faculty and students the opportunity of raising
questions which may not have had adequate coverage. The re-
sponse to these meetings has been discouraging for the analysts,
and embarrassing to those few students who have bothered to

participate.

In order to present a more dramatic example of the inex: |e ws
cusable lack of participation, perhaps a few figures pertaining ||.
to the number of students present at the last two meetings
would suffice. At the meeting in the Commerce School there
were approximately ten (10) students at both the afternoon }
and the evening sessions. The College meeting elicited only
one hardy soul from among the ranks of the concerned and

creative.

This afternoon and tomorrow evening the report to stu-
dents on the progress of the Self-Study section on student life
will be presented in Newcomb Hall. This report deals with stu-
dent government, publications, athletics, discipline, and several
other topics pertaining to student life at Washington and Lee.
Dean John, analyst for this section, will be available not only
at these public meetings, but also for individual discussion of

the report.

Quite obviously the student life discussions are potentially
the most appealing meetings, but it is doubtful if the attend-
ance will undergo any significant change. The Ring-tum Phi,
however, wishes to urge students to take part in these meetings
for the simple reason that the faculty may not provide similar
outlets for student opinion in the future. We will agree with
the faculty’s present feeling that the student response thus
far does not warrant continued effort in this area. In spite of
this disenchantment with attendance the meetings are continu-
scheduled following the holidays. Cer-

tainly our obligation to the University requires firm support of

ing, and more will be

this program.

**True Green Spirit” Is Perpetuated

 

By S. T. Lowry
Department of Economics

Once there was a green family.
There was the Great Green Father,
the green mother, and five greenish
children. The family was constitu-
tionally dedicated to a diet of green
peas, green beans, and the dissemi-
nation of the spirit of the chloro-
phyllus life. It can thus be under-
stood when one day the Great Green
Father turned to his green wife and
said, “Our children are not as green
as they should be! in fact, they are
looking a bit bluish. This will be
ruinous to the family image and is
not good for them either.”

am, know,” sighed the green moth-

r. “It’s because they don’t eat well.

a, They are pickey at
the table and al-
_ though I try every

way to make peas
and green beans
appetizing and in-
teresting, they
just won't eat
’ enough of them to
' keep their color

‘i up.”

“Well, we just
won't put up with
that!” roared the
Great Green Father. “By Jove, I
will just make them sit at the table

 

“Great Green Father”

a full hour three meals a day, and
spoon it down their throats if I
have to. If they turn any bluer, my
image as “The Great Green Father’
will be destroyed.”

Digestive Difficulties

The green mother continued to
prepare green peas and green beans
with half hearted imagination, but
the greenish children stubbornly ate
less and less, and turned bluer and
bluer. The food that the Great
Green Father forced the greenish
children to eat didn’t seem to agree
with them. They had digestive dif-
ficulties and they became bluer and
bluer.

The Great Green Father roared
into the house one day tearing his
hair. “People are beginning to
doubt that our progeny is really
green!” he thundered. “I have tried
throwing green coloring on them as a
finish, but it just rubs off every
time they come in contact with
something, and the blue shows
through.”

Failed Them?

The green mother sighed, “When
they came into this world, they
were hungry for green. They were
suckled on green milk, and they al-
ways wanted more than I could
furnish. How have we failed them?”

“Failed them!” roared the Great

 

Green Father, “We just jolly well
will cut them off from the appetite
killing garbage they consume away
from home and make them eat more.
A father has to do his job”

The children resisted the father’s
restrictions more adamantly and
turned bluer and bluer. The Great
Green Father came to the end of
his rope.

Freudian Imagry

One day, he walked into the kitch-
en where the green mother was going
about her business preparing green
peas and green beans in new and
varied ways using a variety of cook
books that she had ordered from
many distant places. The Great
Green Father sat despondently
thumbing through the pages of some
of the books. “You know,” he said to
the green mother, “none of these
other families seem to be very con-
cerned with our type of problem.”
“Maybe this business of being a
Great Green Father is a bit heavy on
the Freudian imagry side.”

“You know,” said the green moth-
er, “I have been wondering about
that same sort of thing. I really don’t
feel that this role of being the ever
patient loving mother adds up to
much. You notice in this Tichifornia
meal ritual, they start with a com-
pletely different perspective in eat-

 

By WARD BRIGGS

Night Must Fall, presently at the
Lyric is a mess. But rather than cat-
alogue its mistakes, it might be
more useful to see what director
Karl Reisz was really up to. Point
one is that, in choosing to film
Emly Williams’ melodrama about a
psychopathic killer who carries his
victims heads around in a hatbox
and enveigles himself into the good
graces of an old lady and her daugh-
ter in a lonely cottage, Reisz was
making a deliberate breakway from
Saturday Night and Sunday Morning
and social realism. Point two is that,
equally obviously, although the orig-
inal play is foolproof on its own
level very little of its thriller-sus-
pense comes over on the film, so
one must assume that Reisz was out
for more than that.

The script, largely dispensing with
the old suspense motif in favor of
character and atmosphere, provides
a carload of morbid symptoms, allows
for a fine range of sexual fun and
games, and is evidently an attempt
to get inside the minds of both the
murder and victim. Much of the de-
tail is exacting and in
Danny’s horrifying little ritual dance
arount the hatbox, for instance,
which ends with him opening it in
front of a mirror and uttering a
bashful “Hello” to the contents. But
the film remains a series of discon-
nected fragments, unconvincingly
and flatly strung together. That there
was meant to be something more is
indicated by the last sequence in
which Olivia (Susan Hampshire) re-
turns to the house to find the muti-

Current Cinema

Briggs Sees ‘Night Must Fall’
As Break With Social Realism

lated corpse of her mother (Mona
Washburne), has a monent of panic,
calls the police, then goes upstairs
to confront Danny (Albert Finney).
Foolish girl, one thinks, but the kil-
ler cowers inexplicably behind the
washbasin.

Here one is in Antonioni country.
Right from the beginning of Night
Must Fall—Olivia dreaming on a
motionless swing in the hot summer
morning, the camera tracking
through the quiet trees ,the sudden
ery of a bird, the quick zoom in the
clearing where Danny hacks savagely
with an axe at his latest victim—
there is an evident atempt to evoke
characters in the terms of their sur-
roundings, which eventually gets
bogged down in overstatement and
preoccupation with narrative. For
instance when Clovia, the sleeping
princess aroused by a turbulent
love affair, realizes the truth about
Danny, Reisz has her weeping in a
cinema to the accompaniment of
cries, groans and explosions from a
war film; and the final sequence,
cross-cutting between Olivia desper-
ately mending a punctured tire while
Danny, back at the house, hunts her
mother with a meat-axe, owes more
to D. W. Griffith’s montage and
Emly Williams’ narrative than to An-
tonioni.

Nevertheless, it seems that Reisz
has chosen hackneyed personal vis-
ion, There are constant attempts at
distantiation especially in Danny
whose rapid shifts of mood are not
entirely accounted for either by his
madness or by his chameleon habit

 

of adapting his personality to suit

 

 

that of his interlocuter. Reisz dis
tantiates or attempts to by making
sharp cuts: for instance, from Danny
in a pathological rage with Olivia
after he has found her searching his
room, to him happily encouraging
her as she learns to ride his scooter
on the lawn.

One can only applaud Reisz’s
courage for making such a complete
breakaway from the brand of social
realism which has ended by strang-
ling the British cinema, and regret
that his leap into darkness only
landed him into a quagmire.

One day, someone is going to make
a film about a model (or movie star)
with a witty, daring and unconven-
tional theme. The heroine will make
a great deal of money; she will live
playfully and extravagantly: she will
marry even more money. The dar-
ing unconventional aspect of this
will be that she isn’t noticeably cor-
rupted by all this. But not yet. To
suggest that it is anything but ter-
rible at the top is apparently more
than flesh and blood can stand; and
the thing that surprises me about a
film like Darling (at the State) is
that people as sophisticated as John
Schlesinger and Frederick Raphael
should accept constrictions of so
many flatly fashionable attitudes.
Darling is sometimes clever, often
ugly, always self-conscious. But its
view of the world belongs in the
corriders of Park Avenue. Its disil-
lusionment looks like that of a gos-
sip columnist who has left a party
with a monumental hangover, but
will still be back the next day to see
how all the awful people will be
contriving to amuse themselves.

 

Campus Controversy Rages

 

By ROY TYLER

As the columns of the Daily Work-
er praise the work of National Stu-
dent Association, so do members
of the Washington and Lee Execu-

tive Committee.

You would not,
of course, be re-

tion, but you
would be a student at a school
which through NSA not only con-
demnsa the war in Vietnam, but has
made statements which make the
Kiu Klux Kian look like quite an
enlightened organization.

long to an organization which en-

In a letter to the editor of last
Tuesday's Ring-tum Phi, Jeff Wains-
cott made a rather extensive dis-
closure of the objectives and actions
of the NSA. I urge each student to
read it. Also, any interested students
can find an editorial in the December
6th edition of the Richmond News
Leader concerning the NSA.

In last Tuesday's Ring-tum Phi
there was also an editorial about
the organization. The editor remind-
ed the student body that we do not
have to interpret the utterences of
this organization to be representative
of the member schools. I ask, then,
if this organization is going to put
forth policies which we would, as
a member school, not condone, why
should we join the organization?

I also ask how we can join an
organization like the NSA, and not
be identified with the policies it
puts forth and the statements that
it makes?

If you as a student agree with the
policies of this organization, then I
urge that you make your feelings

known, but there is no reason to
think that we can join this organiza-
tion and only be identified with the
policies with which we agree. If we
join, we in effect, approve not only
the ideals for which this organiza-
tion stands (which, I might add, are
not followed particularly closely)
but for each statement of policy it
makes while we are members.

There must be some reason why
Hollins, Lynchburg College, and
Randolph-Macon Woman's College
have withdrawn from the organiza-
tion, while area colleges such as the
University of Virginia and George
Washington University have repeat-
edly refused to join. I am not say-
ing that we should not join merely
because these schools have not
joined, but there is obviously some
reason why these schools have re-
fused to join, and I do not feel it is
because they are too apathetic to be
eoneerned

I urge those who feel that they
cannot agree with the policies of
this organization to speak. Each stu-
dent can make his feelings known to
his respective E.C. representative he-

ing.”

“Yes,” said the Great Green Fath-
er, “but that is too drastic.”

“No” said the green mother, “I am
so sick of these brats that I could
choke them. If they starve to death,
it would serve them right.”

“You are getting your Freudian
roles mixed up,” smiled the Great
Green Father acidly. “I am sup-
posed to be assertive and bombastic
while you are supposed to be reflec-
tive and gentle.”

Tichigorina Menu

“Well, as long as you can be re-
flective and considerate, I guess I
can be assertive and hard boiled,”
snorted the green mother with her
hands on her hips, “We'll try the
Tichigorina menu and eating ritual
and see how it works. No child has
ever been known to starve himself
to death out of spite.”

“All right,” said the Great Green
Father, “but I sure would hate to
have the oldest turn completely blue.
He really has the makings of a really
great greener.”

“Now you are getting maternal”
snapped the green mother.

“Maybe all this business about
roles and obligations is just a bunch
of bogged down tradition that is
beginning to get in our way any-
how,” observed the Great Green
Father.

“Come and Get It”

The next day at noon, the green
mother started the new regimen. The
Great Green Father called the green-
ish children, now quite blue, to din-
ner in the Tichiforina manner,
“Come and get it before we throw
it out!” The food was plain and
straight. The greenish children
slunk sullenly in and looked sourly
at the unappteizing and meager ra-
tions of green peas and green beans.
“Eat if you want, or go on about
your business,” announced the Great
Green Father preemptorily. The
green mother went on about her
business preparing things she en-
joyed for herself, and which fre-

Rider Describes Attributes
Of Washington & Lee Now
In Special Yuletide Tribute

By BRUCE W RIDER

We are rapidly approaching the
Season To Be Jolly, and, in the true
spirit of Christmas, we thought we
would list four or five of the finer
qualities of Washington and Lee Uni-
iversity, qualities which all of us
here are most humbly grateful for.

First and foremost is that essense,
that true core, that one quality
above all others that makes our Uni-
versity what it is:

 

Secondly, we would all agree that
we are immensely proud of the fol-

lowing aspects of Washington and
Lee life:

Thirdly, we hold ever before us the
reminder that our University, above
all, is noted for:

And is there ever a dry Washing-
ton and Lee eye when we think
about:

Lastly, we know in our hearts how
fortunate we have been to be able to
participate in this, one of the finest
of our Washington and Lee tradi-
tions:

Now that we have seen how much
we have to sustain us here at Wash-
ington and Lee men, let us have a
most joyous Christmas. Whe ix more
entitled to it?

By TOM CARPENTER

Next Saturday is the last and cru-
cial day of the National Football
League Season, and the fans will
crowd around their tubes on Sat-
urday and Sunday to scope out
these key matches.

The Eastern Division was sewed up
weeks ago by the Cleveland Browns,
but second place is still up for
grabs. Fortunately the Giant-Cowboy
fame will decide who from the East
will go to Miami for the Meaning-
less Bowl, which is commonly called
the Playoff Bowl. A tie is as good as
a win for the Giants, while the Cow-
boys have to come out on top for
the trip.

Who's Best in the West?

The Western Conference is still in
a state of unsettlement. The Packers
have a half game lead over the Colts
and a game lea dover the Bears. The
Colts play the rolling Rams Sat-
urday in L. A. and must go into the
game as the underdog. The Rams
have been playing like God’s gift to
football as of late, while the Colts
have been unimpressive without the
aid of Johnny Unitas, the “man with
the golden arm.”

Bears Expecting Victory

The Bears play the hapless Vik-
ings and should have little trouble.
But for the Bears to tie for the title
the Packers and Colts both must
lose. The Bears are without a doubt

the best team in football, but have
been unable to overcome three con-
secutive defeats at the beginning of
the season. The Bears should at least
get a trip to Miami because the
Colts stand a very good chance to
lose to the Rams.

The Cardinals, the Redskins, and
the Vikings win the award for being
the biggest disappointments this sea-
son. The Cards have a good excuse.
They have been hurt in both senses
of the word. Star quarterback Char-
ley Johnson has played with an in-
jury or has missed games with an
injury with a frequency equal to a
man’s breathing rate. The Cards also
have had to play with their out-
standing defensive safeties, Larry
Wilson and Jerry Stovall, on the
bench because of injuries.

A New Charlie Taylor

The Redskins have played with a
Charlie Taylor who is not the same
as the Rookie of the Year 1964 and
without a fullback. Dan Lewis is
just an average halfback who should
not be playing fullback.

The Vikings have no excuse. They
have simply played miserable foot-
ball this season.

Saturday and Sunday should pro-
vide the NFL plenty of excitement,
as the teams play who will win the
Western Division. The tubes will be

 

running warm this weekend.

 

Canfield’s Club Coasts Down;
Depths Of Disaster Imminent

Over the weekend Washington and
Lee’s basketball fortunes were dealt
a setback as they dropped two games.
On Friday night at King College
the Generals experienced their
coldest game of the season from the
floor as they were able to hit only
16 per cent in the first half and 25
per cent for the entire game. With
King College hitting with a fair de-
gree of accuracy, it was pretty
much no contest with King trium-
phant, 83-59. Rob Bauer paced the
Generals with 15 points, and the
only other player to hit double fig-
ures for W&L was Frank Morrison
with 11 points.

Saturday night the Generals trav-
eled to Centre to play their first
conference opponent. Playing an im-
proved game, the Generals kept it
close until four minutes were re-

maining. At this point Bob Spessard, | ©

Steve Sweitzer, and Morrison were
all on the bench, having picked up
five points apiece. This cost
Generals’ attack its momentum.
Centre then won going away, 88-75.
Sweitzer was high for the Generals
with 19 points, followed by Bauer
with 17 and Morrison with 10.

of the top rated N.A.LA. teams in
the country and has a front line av-

underdog.

On December 17, the Generals

idays, the Generals will play the

sity of North Carolina at Charlotte

By RAY ZELTNER

Saturday night in the Doremus
Gym the Junior Varsity wrestling
team went down to defeat against
the JV from the University of North
Carolina, 33-3.

The JV lineup had Charlie Ben-
singer at 130, Dave Jackson at 137,
Mike McCreery at 145, Bob Munson
at 152, Zeltner at 169, Bill Ridley at
167, Scott Kennedy at 177, and Ed
Driscoll at heavyweight.

Fast-moving freshman Bob Mun-
son brought in the only points for
W&L on a decision victory over his
opponent. Randy Roper’s illness Fri-
day night sent sophomore Rollie
Jacobs to varsity 123, leaving that
position empty for the JV. Clark

Lowry On ‘Great Green Father’

(Continued from page 2)

quently
Father.

The greenish children whooped
with enthusiasm and rushed away
from the table thinking they had
won a great victory over their in-
transigent parents. The Great Green
Father sadly and uneasily looked at
the wasted food. The mother shrug-
ged, laughed, and scraped the plates
into the pigs trough.

Great Green Father Gratified

After a few days of the Tichifornia
plan, the oldest of the greenish
children began to realize how wan
and unpleasant one looked when one
was bluish and supposed to be
greenish, He started coming to meals
and eating. He was soon eating
ravenously and habitually, although
he didn’t show up from time to time.
The Great Green Father was quite
gratified, and the green mother be-
gan fixing special little green dainties
to go on his plate. The other greenish
children were so enthused about the
Tichigorina play they were turn-
ing quite blue before they real-
ized that a certain amount of green
peas and green beans are necessary
if one wants to pass one’s self off as
a respectable green. One of them,
however, had become so blue that
upon being caught up by an unex-
pected air movement, he was carried
off and disappeared into the wild blue
yonder where he blended perfectly.

Another became quite satisfied
with being blue and the Great Green
Father and the green mother sadly
saw him go trudging off to be a blue
instead of a green. The other two
were dangerously blue before they
began dragging themselves feebly in
to eat one or two meals a day.

Green Mother Relents
They were quite anemic from a

pleased the Great Green

 

green standpoint, and didn’t look
well at all with their sickly bluish
coloration. They couldn’t digest the
straight solid green diet. The green
mother relented slightly and gave
them a slightly thinned down fare
until their appetities were restored
to normal. Very soon, the three re-
maining greenish children were
hanging around the kitchen from
time to time and picking up snacks
even outside of the regular meals.
They continued to sample coarser
diets, but really found that for
greeners, the green diet really suited
best after all. The oldest even be-
gan to show signs of being a fairly
creative cook and the Great Green
Father started looking around to
get him apprenticed out to a spinach
or collard line.

The Great Green Father and the
green mother frequently mentioned
the two children they had lost when
they went on the Tichiforina Plan,
but the both agreed that this was
the price of perpetuating the true
green spirit.
