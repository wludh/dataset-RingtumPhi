Fraternity pledging during the re-
cently-completed Rush Week fell off
slightly from last year’s figures, as
294 freshmen representing 74.0 per
cent of the class of 1966 accepted fra-
ternity bids. In 1964, 267 freshmen,
79 per cent of their class, accepted
bids. This year, 96.8 per cent( 332)
of the 343 entering freshmen regis-
tered for Rush; last year only 84.4
per cent registered. Phi Ep led fra-
ternities in numbers pledged, with
29 freshmen plus one sophomore, an
acceptance rate of 55 per cent of bids
extended. (The campus record for
freshman _ pledging during Rush
Week is held by Kappa Sig, which
pledged 26 in 1962). Pi Phi and Phi
Delt both pledged nineteen boys,
while DU, Phi Gam, Sigma Nu, and
ZBT pledged seventeen each.

Interfraternity Council president
Chuck Griffin Monday night expres-
sed disappointment over the appar-
ent ineffectiveness of the present
method of enforcing Rush regula-
tions. Fines totalling more than
$1,000 were imposed; not one fra-
ternity finish Rush Week “clean.”
Griffin commented that most frater-
nities seemed to feel that “an extra
minute or two” with their rushees
or away from their tables in the
quad was worth being fined. As a
result, the IFC will discuss new
means of penalizing houses for Rush
Week violations.

ing Rush Week are:

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Traditions

“But to think of Washington and Lee is to believe in an
ideal.

“It is to believe that this ideal shall be free, free from new
threats as well as old restraints. It is to believe this ideal may
preserve its liberty against the modern tyrannies of standard-
ization. Humbly seeking to learn from the processes of other
educational effort, this ideal shall be independent of the conta-
gion of conformity, the assumption that every institution must
do exactly the same thing in exactly the same way at exactly
the same time.’

Francis P, Gaines, October 25, 1930

President Cole’s speech last week wandered from his ex-
pected message of steady growth and expansion to become a
plea for maintaining Washington and Lee’s speaking and con-
ventional dress traditions. The address, which was expected by
neither students nor men close to the President, received warm
approval by the student body. Our question is, however, why
would a man in President Cole’s position devote one of his two
major addresses of the school year to a topic of this nature?

Are Washington and Lee’s traditions as valuable to the
welfare of our University as President Cole would indicate?
We submit that they are: What is Washington and Lee? Why
has it attained a reputation as one of this country’s outstanding
institutions of higher learning?

We are not known as a school which produces great ath-
letic teams, though we have produced many. Nor are we known
as a great research center, though research is carried on here.
Nor are we known as the outstanding academic school in
America, though our academic program is excellent and getting
better. No, these are not the reason W&L is remembered.

If Washington and Lee has a single virtue, it must be its
ability to produce gentlemen. Gentlemen, not in the trite sense
of “smooth men of the world,’ but gentlemen in the sense of

 

young men who care, care about themselves and society around
them. This is clearly the point that distresses President Cole,
alumni, faculey members and many among the student bedy. |
Our traditions are nothing more than symbols. |

If these symbols should evaporate from the minds of to- |
day’s students, then our University’s maior claim to existence |
may evaporate with them. It probably won’t hurt our academic
program, but it will signal the dominance of apathy which is |
fast becoming our nation’s most feared disease.

Deans See Adjustment in Fraternity Attitudes as Necessary

 

“Fraternities Are An Integral Part...

By JIM AWAD

As students headed back to Lex-
ington weeks ago, they were |
much concerned with the future of |
fraternities on our campus. Rumor |
had it that one of the deans had esti-
mated that only 40 per cent of the
incoming freshmen would pledge in |
1965. After the open houses, most
Greeks felt that the above statistic
was, if anything, optimistic.

Then, as the bitter fight for fresh-
men became even more intense that
last year, convictions became even
stronger. To top it off, with rush
week over and several houses hav-
ing fewer than ten pledges, rumors
began to circulate that a new stu-
dent union would constructed;
and certainly a large, adequate stu- |
dent union would at least not help |
the

But if the situation is examined |
logically, one cannot help but feel
that fraternities are as strong now
as they have ever been. Let’s ex-
amine the controversy at all perti-
nent points.

First of all, 74 per cent of the
freshman class pledged this Septem-
ber. This compares with 75 per cent!

be

fraternities

| in 1964, 73 per cent in 1963, 83 per

cent in 1961, and 76 per cent in 1960.
Obviously, there has been establish-
ed no trend that would indicate an
early demise of fraternities on this
campus. As many people are pledg-
ing now as ever before.

Secondly, there seems to be no
truth in the rumor that freshmen in
the coming years will not be frater-
nity material. True, the freshmen
will be of a higher caliber. Median
College Board scores are higher now
than they have ever been, and the
students seem to be becoming more
serious about scholastics. No one can
deny the fact that W&L is no longer
the “party school” it used to be.

But Dean John has said, all
the fraternities have to do is adjust
to the “changing W&L.” What they
must do is justify their existence
to the new serious-minded fresh-
men. They must realize their re-
sponsibilities in the academic field
as well as in the traditional social
field. This involves guiding the fresh-
man in his studies as well as get-
ting him dates on the weekends.
This is the crucial point, for if fra-

may very well find themselves in
an awkward position in a few years.
Although fraternities are slow to
change, both Dean Farrar and Dean
John are confident that they

stacle.

Thirdly, we must point out that
the Student Union will not interfere
with fraternities in any way. Grant-
ed, a million dollar building, equip-
ped with swimming pool, Saturday
night combos, pool tables, and beer
might persuade a substantial num-
ber of freshmen not to pledge. But
such is not the for no such
building being planned; rather,
plans call for an improvement of
the facilities available to the 20 per
cent of the student body that chose
not to pledge.

ties are an integral part of Wash-
ington and Lee. There is nothing to
take the place of fraternities as to
social functions and lodging on this
campus.”

What we find, then, is the Greeks
are as strong as ever. They must
however, accommodate themselves
to the changing nature of the cam-
pus; they must justify themselves to
the new breed of students. Further-
more, they must prove their utility
to such an extent as to be able to
withstand nationwide criticism of
fraternities—a criticism that has
closed the doors of many chapters
the country over and which, inevit-
ably, will be leveled directly at the
fraternities at W&L. To prove their
utility, they must further the causes
of scholarship, campus and national
activities, psychological guidance, and
athletics—as well as parties.

Pusey Requests Applications for Wilson, Fulbright Awards

 

Competition Opens For Grants

Dean William W. Pusey recently |
called attention to the Woodrow |
Wilson National Fellowships and}
U.S. Government Fulbright-Hays
Scholarships for 1966-67 for which |
academically outstanding Washing- |
ton and Lee seniors can be nomi-|
nated. |

To attract promising young men |
and women to the profession of col- |
lege teaching, the Foundation each |
year awards fellowships to about a|
thousand carefully selected prospec-
tive first year graduate students.

The foundation primarily supports
candidates in the humanities and so-
cial sciences, but in exceptional |
cases, when a clear preference for a
teaching career is demonstrated, can-
didates in mathematics or the natur-
al sciences may also be nominated.

A Fellow receives $2,000 for one
academie year. There is an addition-
al allowance for married men with
children. The Foundation also pays
tuition and fees.

All seniors who are interested in

 

considering a career in college teach-

urged to discuss the fellow-
ships at their earliest convenience
with their major professors and with
Dean Pusey, who is Campus Repre-
sentative for the Woodrow Wilson
Fellowships. The deadline for nomi-
nations is October 31, 1965.

Dr. Pusey stated that 28 Washing-
ton and Lee men have received Wil-
son Fellowships in past years. He
stressed both the prestige connected
with the fellowships and their gener-
ous financial support. In addition to
the recipients of ‘the awards, he
added, many candidates receive hon-
orable mention, which may lead to
assistance from other

ing are

financial
sources.

U.S. Government Scholarships
provided for by the Fulbright-
Hays Act are part of the educational
exchange program of the Depart-
ment of State. Their purpose is to in-
crease mutual understanding be-
tween the people of the United States
and other countries.

Three separate types of grants are

available to United States citizens
holding a bachelor’s degree and pos-
sessing certain language proficiency.

A full grant provides round-trip
transportation, language and orien-

Radio Reflects Asian

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Editor’s note: W&L geology ma-
jors Chip Roadman and Warren
Montgomery are taking a year's
leave-of-absence to work aboard
Columbia University’s oceano-
graphic research ship Vema, The
following report was sent to the
Ring-tum Phi by Montgomery.

R. V. Vema, September 16:
Ever since the Vema_ steamed

westward from Hawaii and into the
oriental Pacific last spring, the
American scientists aboard have been
increasingly aware of the commun-
ist-democratic, East-West conflict
which seems to permeate the Orient.
Here it is the bitter, dogged, some-
times vicious spirit of that conflict
which impresses itself on us, rather
than the sparse details which are
known to anyone who reads the
newspapers or listens to the radio.

It is the radio, in fact, which has
become the principal instrument of
that struggle, the physical manifes-

tation of which is the Vietnam War. |
The Vema’s radio picks up Radio!

Radio Peking

Of these four, Radio Peking is
the most impressive because it is the
most shocking. China’s official Eng-
lish language broadcasts always be-
gins with the International Labor
Hymn and the “news.” The an-
nouncer is almost always a woman,
speaking correct English with a
slight oriental intonation. Those who
have ever heard her broadcasts are
reminded of Tokyo Rose.

China’s version of international
news takes up at least half of the
broadeast time and is repeated mo-
notonously, word for word, all day.
The content of these broadcasts is
startling to anyone who takes Voice
of America as the truth. According
to Peking, the Peoples’ National
Liberation Front of Vietnam (Viet
Cong) is daily winning decisive vic-

tories against the “U.S. Imperial-
ists’ and their “government pup-
pets.” The Los Angeles riot “was no

In addition, Peking usually in-

poems, or inspiring stories. The
hymns are quite beautiful and im-

men and children were singing that,
“...courageous people of South
Vietnam will drive the Yankee Im-
perialist and their corrupt puppets
into the sea; and we will kill them
to the last man; we will impale them
on sticks of bamboo; we will...”

Peking’s “stories” are told in the
vein of a child’s bedtime tale, but

Freshmen Net $87,000 of W&L Financial Aid
As Available Scholarships Balloon 30 Per Cent

Financial aid to members of the
freshman class entering Washington
and Lee University this fall will in-
crease more than 30 per cent over the
1964-65 academic year.

Seventy-six of the 346 freshmen
have been awarded $87,000 from Uni-
versity sources for the coming ses-
sion, according to a report by Lewis
G. John, director of student finan-
cial aid.

The largest number, 56, will par-
ticipate in the University’s grant-
loan program. They receive three-
fourths of their aid during the fresh-
man year in scholarship assistance
and one-fourth in loan help.

Ten of the entering students wil!
be Robert E. Lee Scholars. The in-
creased number of the Lee Scholars
was made possible by the additional
gift to the University of $300,000 by
the anonymous donor who estab-
lished the Scholarship Fund with a
$200,000 gift in 1955. The latest gift
assured continuance of the program
for another 10 years.

Six of the freshmen will be Baker
Scholars, chosen by the University
Board of Trustees’ selection commit-
tee under the $100,000 George F.
Baker Trust, established at 15 liberal
arts colleges in the United States.

Four area boys have been award-
ed Rockbridge County grants, which

 

now pay $1,000 as a reduction in the
University comprehensive tuition
fee.

In addition to these 76 receiving
University aid, there are among the
entering students three National
Merit Scholars, the largest number

to enter the University in any year
since the program was begun, and
16 applicants for aid who presented
outstanding entrance credentials but
had no demonstrated financial need.

65 Football Generals Forecast W

W&L To Meet Randolph-Macon

In Season’s Opener ‘Tomorrow

Last year’s
football team managed a 4-5 record.
At this point in the 1965 season,
the only prediction which can be
made is that the record should be
better this year. How much better
will be determined by how fast sev-
eral sophomores can develop to plug
holes caused by injuries.

The Generals will have their first
chance to show their improvement
when they face Randolph-Macon at
Wilson Field tomorrow. The game
hapes up as a tough one, as the
top-ranked

Yellow Jackets upset
Susquehanna last week

The most outstanding feature about

this year’s team will be a forward
wall that has the three requirements
for excellence: size, speed and ex-

perience. Head Coach McLaughlin
said he felt that these were the boys
who would have to really put out if
the season were to be successful.
Men like Warren Stewart, Logan
Bullit, Charlie Myers, Tersh Baker,
Tom Day, and Jay Bowersox who
average 200 pounds, make the of-
fensive and defensive lines a really
frightening experience for would-be
autumn heroes.

Coach McLaughlin will use the
platoon system. In this way the
boys will have to play only offense
Because lack of depth
and experience weakens the offen-
sive backfield, and two of the three

or defense.

Washington and Lee] promising. Bryant Kendrick, a good

quarterback last year, has develop-
ed into a hard-hitting halfback to
help fill in holes, but the other half-
back spot depends on second-year
man Rudd Smith, an effective, but
relatively inexperienced ballplayer.

Shoring up this starting backfield
is ferocious little Tri-Captain Billy
Andrews, who has had experience
at halfback. Presently, however,
Coach Mac has placed Billy in the
defensive secondary, where his Erich
Barnes type talent will be utilized
iwainst opposing passing attacks.
Still if the starting backfield finds
itself hit by injuries, the Generals
could be in real trouble.

A big line and a backfield with
little depth has left many teams with
losing records. That dilemma should
not arise here. All the coaches feel
the boys are hitting harder than they
were this time last year—a very
good sign. Seniors want to end their
football careers with a winning sea-
son, and the younger boys hope to
flag down their first letter sweater
or restore W&L’s football fortunes

I-M Week

 

Toss-Up Seen In °65 Intramurals

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Sports Illustrated has, for several
years, teamed with Jimmy “the
. Greek” Snyder and
| other Las Vegas
| oddsmakers in
complete domina-
tion of the field of
sports prognastica-
tion. It is common
knowledge that the
latter holds more
than a slight edge
in correct deci-
sions, but now a
third national in-
stitution arises to
challenge these mighty forces. The
intruder is the Friday R-t P. How-
ever we must admit that we will be
delighted if we accomplish little
more than forcing SI into a few cor-
rect picks and avoiding the laughter
of Las Vegas.

The field of endeavor narrows to
intramural athletics at our hallowed
institution, giving us a thin advant-
age over the present champions. We
would prefer to read the crystal ball
after spending a week observing the
conflict and compiling the lab sched-
ule of all the jocks concerned, but
even the University can’t do the
former and probably doesn’t really
know the latter. Therefore, the fol-
lowing jinxes.

I-M tennis and golf, having opened
Wednesday, present the first prob-
lem, for both this edition and the
fraternity athletic directors. In ten-
nis, League A pits last year’s cham-
pion Phi Ep squad, perhaps in a

 

Bensinger

league of its own, against Sigma
Nu, Kappa Sig, Sigma Chi, and Phi
Kap. with the nod going clearly
to Phi Ep. League B should see

 

ZBT edge SAE, last year’s runner-up
with PiKA, Phi Gam, and Phi Psi |
further behind.
Beta should win League C by de-
feating Lambda Chi, Pi Phi, Phi |
Delt, and DU. KA holds avery nar- |
row edge over the rest of League D,
Delt, NFU, Law, and SPE. As league
play draws to a close, seeding for
the Davis Cup will be announced.
Golf promises to be marked by
closer competition as two leagues
have co-favorites. League A should
see Sigma Nu repeat, with DU, NFU,
and SPE fighting for second. League |
B appears to be a toss-up between |

 

EEOLEEEEEEEEL EEE EE LEEDLEEE LEST DEDEDE DEED ER EEL EEE OLED LEE LEER GEOL ERTIES
oe

+

ZBT and Kappa Si,g, KA, Pi Phi and
Lambda Chi will follow, probably in
some order preordained by the Hill.
Sigma Chi is picked over Delt, Beta,
Phi Psi, and PiKA in League C.

League D will see either Phi Delt
or Phi Gam emerge the winner
over Phi Ep, Law, and Phi Kap.
These choices, however, are not as
clear-cut as are those in the tennis
competition, for as we all know

strange things happen on the Lex-
ington golf (?) course.

Final point standings last year show
the Intercollegiate column headed by
Delt, DU, and SAE. The Intramural
leaders were Phi Kap, SPE, and
ZBT. Overall the top three were
Phi Kap, SAE, and Delt. We are
unequivocal in our statement that we
have absolutely no idea of how this
year’s competition will end.

Now Maj. Walter F. Daniel, test pilot for the YF-12A,
answers your questions about the world’s fastest
manned airplane and America’s Aerospace Team.

 

(Maj. Daniel, a test pilot since 1954, is a member
of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots. He
received a B.S. degree in Aeronautical Engineering
from the University of Oklahoma, In February
1962, he set world class time-to-climb records in a
T-38 jet trainer)

Is the YF-12A the world’s fastest manned aircraft?

It certainly is. On May 1 of this year the YF-12A
(formerly known as the A-11) reclaimed the world
absolute speed record from the USSR. It was
clocked at 2,062 mph over Edwards Air Force Base.

How big is the YF-12A?

The exact dimensions of the YF-12A have not been
released yet. But it's approximately 100 feet long,
with about a © )-foot wingspan. That's half again
as big as our present interceptors!

Is the Air Force training many men
as pilots these days?
Yes, very definitely. In spite of all you hear about
unmanned vehicles, the human pilot is still very
much in the picture. As a matter of fact, the Air
Force pilot quota is on the increase.

What other kinds of jobs does the Air Force offer?
Since it's one of the world’s foremost technological
organizations, the Air Force has plenty of openings
for scientists and engineers. There are also many
challenging and varied administrative-managerial
Positions.
What do I have to do to become
an Air Force officer?

Air Force ROTC is the best way to get started as an

Air Force officer. The new two-year Air Force
ROTC program makes this method available to
men whe have already completed a year or two of
their college education. For college graduates, if
you did not take advantage of ROTC, you can
still get started through Air Force Officer Training
School (OTS), a three-month course open to both
men and women,

Can I keep up my studies while
I'm in the Air Force?

The Air Force encourages its men and women to
continue their educations. For instance, you may
qualify to study for a graduate degree during off-
duty hours, with the Air Force paying a substantial
part of the tuition,

What kind of future do I have in the Alr Force?

A bright one. As we move further into the Aero-
space Age, the Air Force is going to grow even
more important. And you can grow with it!

diers) walking down the road one
day; so arming themselves with
sticks, they hid in the ditch. When
the puppets by, the brave
peasants beat their brains out and
took their rifles, proudly marching
off into the sunset to join the Peo-
ples’ National Liberation Army.”

Radio Moscow’s English language
broadcast, transmitted through Si-
beria, begins with the station’s fun-
ereal theme song and then goes into
the news. The Russian programs are
much more restrained —or subtle—
than those of their Chinese allies.
The news is slanted, of course, but
Radio Moscow avoids the blatant
lies and patent absurdities given out
by Radio Peking. We are still called
imperialists, aggressors, ete. but
without the shrill vindictiveness of
the Chinese. Russian radio entertain-
ment is delightful compared to
China’s—hours and hours of classical

 

music, but no “decadent” jazz or

rock and roll.

Voice of America is comparable to
Radio Moscow; it gives the news
with a western slant. It admits our
reverses in Vietnam, but only when
they are coupled with some measure
of victory or recovery. V.O.A. does
not generally indulge in name call-

ing, though it will refer to the
Vietnamese insurgent forces as
“communist terrorists.” Like Radio

Peking, Voice of America spikes the
news with atrocity stories, though
never so ghastly as the Chinese ones.
V.O.A. also announces with great
relish daily communist mortality
rates, a rather ghoulish practice
which probably does more harm than
good.

American entertainment consists of
music of all sorts, sports broadcasts,
letters to the editor and answers,
and sometimes informative, some-
times dubious programs on Ameri-
can history and government. I heard
one such program the other day

which cited the wars the U.S. has}

fought as proof of America’s tradi-
tion of anti-imperialism. They did
not mention “Manifest Destiny,” or
the Mexican War, strangely enough.

The V.O.A. program concentrates
on science, with emphasis on the
space program. In all, Voice of
America is clearly more interesting
and probably more objective than

its Chinese and Russian counter-
parts.
We Americans aboard the Vema

have seen riots in Tokyo, commun-
ist-breeding slums in Manila, and
America’s ponderous military build-
up on Okinawa. But none of these
have given us such an idea of the
fundamental struggle that exists
here in the East as hearing the radio
broadcasts these people daily hear
and believe.
