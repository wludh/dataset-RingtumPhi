IEC Recommends Ban Of Dual Lists

 

 

73 Students
Earn 2.5, 109
Under Auto

By CHRIS MILLS

The class of 1969 stole the
spotlight in the recently an-
nounced first semester grades,
placing a record twenty men
on the Dean’s list and Honor

Roll, eligible for initiation into
Phi Eta Sigma, the freshman hon-
orary society.

A total of 73 students in the Uni-
versity made scholastic averages in
excess of 2.5 and were placed on
the Honor Roll. This figure includes
the 20 freshmen, of whom four re-
ceived all A’s, and seven straight-A
upperclassmen. Last year there were
no first year men with a perfect
average, but there was greater
number of upperclassmen with three-
point averages, a total of twelve.

Under the new University regu-
lations, a student no longer “severs
his connection with the University”
under the Automatic Rule after the
completion of an odd number of se-
mesters. In other words, he will not
be forced to leave at the end of the
fall term if he falls below certain
academic standards.

Instead, students are placed on
academic probation during the sec-
ond semester; if. at the end of that
semester, they have not met the
minimum standards required under
the provisions of their probation,
then they will be dropped from the
rolls.

The application of these new rules
has placed 109 men on academic pro-
bation. Last year, under the old
regulation, 26 men were dropped
from the rolls, but comparisons are
unfair between the two systems since
the new rules lay down more de-
manding averages which must be
met to avoid academic probation

Thirteen of the students presently
on academic probation are there due
to I's on their semester reports. If
they successfully remove these
grades of Incomplete, they may al-

a

so be removed from academic pro- |

bation

| fraternities, one including the names

of all incoming freshmen, and the
other containing only the names of
the Jewish freshmen. The practice
was begun in order to allow cer-
tain fraternities to comply with the
racial exclusion clauses of their char-
ters.

In proposing
IFC, Vice
pointed

the measure to the
President Billy Cannon
out that there has been
increasing pressure in the past years
upon the University to end the two-
list system. President Chuck Griffin
added that there had been in addi-
tion a great deal of criticism direct-
ed against fraternities in general
because exclusion clauses, and
suggested the abolition of the sepa-
rate lists would provide an oppor-
tunity to create good will

of

In addition, said Griffin, previous
law suits have established that “it’s

illegal to do what we've been do-

ing We're helping you break the
law.’
Dean Edward C. Atwood, agree-

ing with Griffin, said that while it
must be recognized that some fra-
ternities forbidden by their na-
tional organizations to pledge Jews,
“it is not the function of the Univer-
sity t exclusion

are

o toster clauses in
fraternities.”

Dean Atwood also announced that
the question concerning religious af-
filiation will removed from
missions application forms this yea
He explained that the information
has never been used for determining
admissions, but only for the purposes
of supplying fraternities with Jew-
ish and non-Jewish lists, and for
providing the local ministers with
lists of students of each demonina-
tion

be ad-

Beginning this year, lists for min-
isters will made up from Fresh-
man Camp applications. If the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee acts affirm-
atively on the IFC's proposal, as is
expected, the separate list of Jewish

be

students for fraternity use will be
abolished altogether

that houses which still maintain ex-
clusion should

THE RING-TUM PHI

_— Edition

Exit WASP

Wednesday night’s vote by the Interfraternity Council to
eliminate, at least on the surface, any discrimination between
students on the basis of religion must be lauded as a step for-
ward to achieving the true meaning of fraternal brotherhood.

The proposal, which passed 14-0-1 only after considerable
debate, recommends that the Student Affairs Committee dis-
continue the publishing of dual lists (one Jewish, one Gentile)
for rush purposes. The action simply clears the hands of the
administration and IFC from any part in condoning or per-
petuating the so-called “WASP clause” in many national fra-
ternity charters.

The debate did not revolve around the intent of the clauses
which are designed clearly to eliminate from membership any
person who is not white, anglo-saxon, and protestant, but rather
cloaked itself in a robe of self-righteousness placing the entire
blame for such clauses on the national fraternity. Questions like
“what will our national think?” “what does this mean to our
house in relation to national?”; and “we have lost good boys |
because of the clause but our by-laws... .” etc. provided the |
external basis for argument.

Operating on the assumption that it is in fact the
national, not the local, which forces the discrimination,
we feel that it is high time that W&L fraternities who
are still bound by such clauses wake up and take the
lead in getting them abolished from their national char-
ters. It should be remembered that a national fraternity
is no more, or no less, than the sum of its locals.

The WASP clause cannot be defended on any
grounds. And fraternities who find comfort operating under
labels, such as a “pure Christian organization’”’ are doing noth- |

moral

ing more than fooling themselves. A true Christian view de- |
mands the acceptance of all men into the corporate whole in|

Montgomery Returns From South Pacific;
Finds Civilization Incongruent To West

Editor’s note: Feature Editor War-
ren Montgomery has just returned
to W&L after a ten month’s cruise
aboard Columbia University’s ocean-
ographic research, R. V. Vema.
This is the first in a series of ar-

ticles on the expedition.

By WARREN MONTGOMERY

Last April, while the Vema was
calling in Tahiti, I had the good luck
to a fall off my rented motor scoot-
er in Papeete,
landing in the
French provincial
hospital with an
immobilized right
leg. Ensconced
among five mag-
nificent French
nurses, I began to
make serious so-
ciological compar
isons between
W&L and Tahiti,
which, _ pertinent
are here presented.

Yes, I often thought about my
snow-bound, book-ladened ex-fel-
low-students here in Lexington. The
similarities between Tahiti and Lex-
ington are astounding—I can’t think
of any right off hand, but you can
draw your own conclusions:

This narrow ring of land is the

is as lovely in its way as the moun-

tropical vegitation. The forests are

age, due to western food and dis-
ease. In Papeete, the capital, they are
jrequired to wear western clothing,
| but elsewhere may wear the tradi-
tional costume—a piece of vivid
cloth, three yards by one, called a
pareu (pah-ray-oh). Women wear
it draped around the waist, like a

existed on Tahiti, and still does to| bath towel. Men wear it like that or

tucked up short, like diapers.

Grass House

| Many Tahitians still live in grass
houses, whose palm leaf roofs and
woven grass wall panels are support-
ed on frames of bamboo. I recently
saw a prominent American news
magazine call this “poverty,” one of

 

the most uninformed ideas I have
ever run across. Those Tahitians
who have managed to maintain a
grass shack existence have more in
life than most people of our socie-
ty. Tahiti is one of the few places
where, in the original civilization,
the people seem to have everything
they need or want.

Food in the original civilization of
the islands, and for those who still
have land, is provided practically
without effort. Edible fruits and veg-
etables grow everywhere; the cli-
mate is a constant 75-90 degrees.
Fish are available to anyone who
will cut a tree to build an outrig-
ger canoe. A typical Tahitian meal
(to which I was often invited by a
family I knew there) may consist
of‘ raw and cooked fish, taro root,
papaya poi (mush), bananas, and
breadfruit. Everything is dipped in
a sour coconut sauce and eaten with
the fingers.

For those who have managed to
keep the old ways—and not all Ta-
hitians have—housing, food, and
clothing are provided by nature. The
native way of life completely ful-
fills the slight requirements of the
mild South Seas environment, and
it certainly should not be classified
as poverty.

Musical Language

The Tahitian language is more mu-
sical than any I have heard before.
Tahitian words drop consonants,
stressing the vowels. For example,
there are: the district of Faaa (fa-
ah-ah), the Taharuu river (tah-hah-
roo-o0o), the island of Moorea (Moh-
oh-ray-ah), and the Faatau family
(fah-ah-tah-oh). All Tahitians still
speak their native language, and
most speak French as well.

The Tahitians are looked down
upon as lazy by their French rulers,
but this was not my impression.
Westerners characteristically apply
their standards to people whose cul-
tures allow no comparison with ours.
Hence, joyous sexuality becomes
“promiscuity,” grass-shack life be-
comes “poverty,” and a reasonable
aversion to unnecessary manual la-
bor becomes “laziness.” The truth is
that the Tahitians have no need to
work, in our sense of the word, but
can energetically pursue the joie de
vivre characteristic of Polynes-
ians. Unlike in our harsh “temper-
ate” zone, the Tahitians have no
need to struggle for existence, and
our idea of work is both virtueless
and meaningless in Polynesia.

(Next week: several customs of
the Tahitians, and threats to their
civilization.)

Fancy Dress Snow Job Causes
‘Some Pretty Weird Situations’

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, I may not be able to pick
the games, but, boy, can I predict
the snow. I think
that it can be
truthfully said
that much snow
fell this Fancy
Dress, probably
both outside and
in. To those poor
guys whose dates
never got here, we
offer our condol-
ences, or congrat-
ulations as the
case may be. The
same goes for the guys whose
dates were snowed in here and had
to stay an extra day.

Needless to say, the snow set up
some pretty weird situations. Some
apartment men found their water
pipes frozen, and there just ain’t no
way to flush the john without water.
A Lexington Police Department
squad car got stuck in the snow and
had to be pushed free by W&L stu-
dents helping the town police—amaz-
ing.

And about the students who
couldn’t get back in town for Mon-
day classes? Shades of Charlie Milne!
We were just about the only col-
lege in Virginia that had classes.
That in itself may be the biggest
snow joke of the week.

Turning to a drier subject, I find
myself confronted with Intramurals.

The basketball finals have begun,
and it looks like Kappa Sig will
take the crown. In the first night
of action, Sigma Nu and Kappa Sig
were the winners, as they defeated
Phi Gam 47-17 and ZBT 42-38.

The second night was highlighted

Generals Back In Action;
Here For Towson. Tonight,
Face R-M Tomorrow
By RON KESSLER

The Washington and Lee basket-
ball team re-opens its season to-
night after a three week exam break,
taking on Towson College at 8
p.m. in Doremus Gym.

According to Head Coach Verne
Canfield, Towson is “one of the best
shooting teams we play. The keys
will be a good defensive effort and
strength on the boards.” Last year,
Towson defeated the Generals %
to 90 in a poorly officiated game.
“This year,” said Canfield, “it should
be one of our better games.”

Tomorrow night, the W&L five
play Randolph-Macon College, prob-
ably the best team in the state.
Coach Canfield claimed that Macon
has “five boys that look just great
and a good bench. As far as we are
concerned, all our practices are be-
ing geared toward the Towson
game.”

In general, Canfield asserted that
the team is making definite progress

by a 31-25 upset of Sigma Nu by the
Kappa Sigs, while in the second
game the Fiji’s defeated ZBT.

Last week I picked Sigma Nu, and
now they’re on the ropes. Since I
have developed such a fantastic
trend in sports prognostication, I
have decided to turn pro. This means
that if any fraternity would like to
insure a championship, it has only
to turn in the highest bid for my
services, whereupon I will pick as
co-favorites all the other competing
teams.

Handball competition in the final
round will begin this Monday and
will last three days. The

way play-off with PiKA and SPE),
Kappa Sig, and PEP. On the advice
of the IM handball scorer I will try
again. PEP and KA to fight for first,
followed by Kappa Sig and then
Beta.

League A: KA (3-0), Pi Phi, SAE,
and Phi Delt (1-2).

League B: Beta, PiKA, and SPE
(all 3-1 with Beta the play-off win-
ner), then Phi Psi (0-4).

League C: Kappa Sig (4-0), Delt
(3-1), and then ZBT, Phi Kap, and
Sigma Chi (all 1-3).

League D: PEP (4-0), Lambda Chi,
DU, and Phi Gam (all 2-2), and
NFU (0-4).

On January 14 the Washington

In a good team effort, the Generals
pulled ahead with a winning med-
ley relay that missed the W&L rec-
ord by only a second.

In the 50 freestyle freshmen Park-
er Moore came in first, as did Billy
Ball in the individual medley. The
Wake Forest A.C.C. diving champ,
Drew Taylor, broke the pool record
with 212 points, while sophomore
Noel Clinard came in second with
195 and Rich Stevens placed third.

Wrestlers Tackle NCS & Duke
After 29-6 Victory Over W&M

Looking back to January 12, it
seems that the Washington and Lee
varsity wrestling team defeated Wil-
liam and Mary 29-6, after losing the
first two individual matches.

Bobby Payne started the comeback
by winning a forfeit at the 137 pound
class. Co-captain Kim White then
decisioned his man, 14-3, to put W&L
ahead 8-6,

Charlie Slaughter, leading 13-2,
pinned his man with only 1:02 re-
maining in the final period. Jamie
Andrew, the other co-captain, and
Bob Munson followed up by out-
pointing their men 10-0 and 10-5,

Once again, there was a forfeit in
W&L’s favor, as Jay Clarke picked
up an easy five points. Holmes Rak-
er, the littlest heavyweight, won by
default in the first period when, with
the score 2-2, his opponent withdrew
with an injury.

The W&L J.V. wrestling team used
the same come-from-behind tactics
in defeating the Augusta Military
Academy varsity, 23-14.

After losing the first four matches,
the Generals got back on the win-
ning track when Charlie Slaughter
pinned his opponent in the excellent
time of 1:40.

Bob Munson, winner by a 6-3
score, was followed by three straight
pins. Clark Carter got his man at
2:40, Will Ridley pinned his at 5:00,
and Hugh Brougher, outweighed by
95 pounds, pinned the A.M.A. heavy-
weight at 4:45.

The William and Mary victory
brings the team’s record to 3-1, with
‘he nexi match against N.C. State on
February 8, followed by Duke the
next night. Originally these match-
es were to be on February 4 and
5, but weather conditions necessitat-
ed the postponement.

Last year the Generals defeated
both of these teams, N.C. State 23-10
and Duke 30-4. The N.C. State

match may prove closer than last

Ever wonder why you see so
many columns like this that use

these three little stars to break up
the sections? If so, and even if not,
it is simply because the writer can’t
think of a transitionary sentence.

Now that the educational note for
today has been inserted, I would
like to call attention to the beautiful
planning which characterizes our
second semester. How about the fact
that George Washington’s birthday
will be celebrated this year with
the ODK assembly for which attend-
ance seems to be required, while at
the same time New Orleans will be
celebrating Mardi Gras.

Then there is the not-so-unusual
conflict in the timing of our spring
vacation and that of every other

 

school in the nation, especially the
Fast Moving Five (note—an exag-
geration of this nature is called a
hyperbole).

And, of course, there is the won-
derful Co-op book store, the place
where the smiling ladies say, “Oh,
well that book hasn’t come in yet.”
To this the woebegotten student says,
“But I have to read the first seven-
teen chapters, all 17,386 pages, by
tomorrow for a test.”

“But no professor would make
such a large first assignment.”

“But this is for a mid-semester
test.”

“Oh!”

As a noted faculty member would
say: the prices may be high, but
the service is slow.

Sigma Chi and SPE led the fra-

These twenty men will be eligible

and to insure that at each general
meeting there would be a sufficient
amount of business to be taken care
of.

The system will be tested in the
coming month on a four-week trial
basis.

Also brought up for discussion was
a proposal that house officer elec-
tions should all be held on a com-
mon date, preferably immediately
after the January semester break
each year.

The suggestion was made in order
to find a solution for the IFC's dif-
ficulty in maintaining continuity of
policy, particularly on committees.
As the system operates now, house
elections are conducted throughout
the year. The result is a constant
turnover of committee members and
the paralyzing of committee policy-
making.

A second advantage to a common
election date, said Cannon, would be
that fraternity house presidents and
treasurers could attend a_ single
workshop at the beginning of the
semester, in which all could be fa-
miliarized with their responsibilities.

Exceptions would be made in the
case of houses whose elections are
set on a specific date by their na-
tional organizations.

The proposal will be formally pro-
posed and voted on at a future meet-
ing.
