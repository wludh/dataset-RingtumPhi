The Purge

The Executive Committee is to be congratulated for trash-
ing the class offices of secretary, treasurer and historian. These
positions which have for years been useless appendages to our
system of student government once served as compromises
for campus political parties. With their dispersion they signal
an end to any form of clique politics.

It is our hope now that class offices have been pruned of
excess baggage, the Executive Committee will see fit to place
some responsibility in elected class officers, namely the presi-
dent and vice-president, who aside from staging a dance set
once a year, really don’t have much to do either.

In the past the EC has been handicapped in bringing about
needed changes in student government because it lacked the
time to consider alternative courses of action. These officers
provide an excellent area in which to choose men to serve on
study committees for the EC.

In addition, the president and vice-president of each class
may now be encouraged to take over the functions of the hap-
pily now-extinct positions of secretary, historian, and treasurer
of their classes. In the hands of able and willing executives
these offices may earn the attention and regain the importance
which they must originally have been intended to possess when
the class officer system was first put into effect.

Class officers might also provide a basis for more repre-
sentative student government. If definite meetings could be
held for the purpose of considering grievances, ideas or recm-
mendations brought to them by student officers they might find
the revamped program useful.

Opportunity Strikes

Alas, the opportunity strikes.

For the first time in many years this campus has the op-
portunity to build something that other campuses around the
country have had for years. Yes, W&L is in the 20th century.

Under the auspices of Dean Edward C. Atwood Jr. a com-
mittee last week was selected to determine the nature and facil-
ities of a new student union. It will be a new co-op not only
in physical plant, but, it is hoped, a new co-op in viability and
services to the student body as well.

On most campuses, the student co-op offers a place where
students can come for a bite to eat, and not only between
the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. It offers game rooms and meet-
ing rooms. An adequate book store with reasonable prices is
also a part.

Washington and Lee is essentially a small school immersed
in a fraternity-oriented way of life. However, a co-op provides
much, not only to the 24 per cent of the student body that re-
mains without fraternity affiliation, but to the students as a
whole,

If an extensive and adequate student union is built, it will
not only provide a choice for those students who decide against
joining a fraternity and consequently under present facilities
suffer because of non-existent recreational provisions, but also
supplement the fraternities where they do not provide for the
student. The results will benefit everyone regardless of their
views toward the W&L fraternity system.

We urge that the student union committee push not for
an enlargement of present facilities, nor splitting of the stu-
dent union and co-op, but a new building which could serve
not only independent students and freshmen, but also provides
recreational facilities for all students. After all, isn’t that the
essence of the term?

In short, then, it is our hope that the Student Union Com-
mittee will take note of co-ops on other campuses, and incor-
porate some of their facilities into the plans for ours. This is
opportunity.

“Operation Match” Revolutionizes Dating
For Knaves, Drunks and Inexpert Lovers

By DAVE MARCHESE

Gentlemen, and this is primarily
directed to the Washington and Lee
gentlemen who in the past have been
grossly confused for U.Va. slobs as
well as being editorially slandered
as knaves, drunks and inexperienced
lovers. Well, ah, gentlemen if this
be the nasty truth, and you find
your supply of dates dwindling or
already “consumed” don’t sweat it
the jocks say, “There is yet a
glimmer of hope. Actually, I speak
with a tongue somewhat forked up.
Granted, since the social
has not yet jacked all of us into
gear most of the area nymphs are
still gamboling through the woods
unscathed by the poison ivy which
W&L Gentlemen spread.

So why not get them before they
find out exactly what we're really
like. You’re probably saying to your-
self, Marchese, we're doing just that;
we're going down the road and get-
ting blind dates; we’re going to
those exasperating mixers, humoring
all the pseudo-sophisticated fresh-
men,

Well, gentlemen, your days of
frustration and woe are over! The
elixir of your social life does exist.

t's called “Operation Match.” As
the name indicates, this program is
designed to match you with the
girls of your choice. I'd like to em-
phasize the phrase “your choice.”
This program, the brain-child of
several mixer-weary,  blind-date
frustrated Harvard students is a
computer matching project which
matches you according to your vital
statistics, qualifications and prefer-
ences to a number of girls of mutual
tastes, interests and desires! How
does it work? That's easy to explain.
Next week the regional directors of
operation match will attempt to can-
vass directly and indirectly the en-
tire student body. For the adven-
turous sum of three dollars you can
experience the exotic and erotic re-
wards of operation match. After an-

Columnist Writes From His Heart

Let's Not ‘Baby’ Freshmen,

By JIM AWAD

For the past few years a contro-
versy has been flaring as to the value
and future of the traditions that go
hand and hand with Washington and
Lee.

Any intelligent observer can see
that the proponents of both sides of
the controversy have worthwhile
points to expound. But there ap-
peared an article in last Tuesday's
Ring-tum Phi which totally destroys
one’s faith in the intelligence and
integrity of those who favor the
status quo, For reasons of tact, the
name of the columnist shall not be
mentioned; but it is essential that
the article be answered.

Granted, a freshman is a first-year
student, but that has no bearing on
his ability to evaluate the society of
which he is a part. He is not a child
learning to walk, and he need not
necessarily stumble. Rather, he is a
fully grown adult who has just
walked into a new society. If I were
a freshman, I would be more than
insulted at being compared to an in-
fant. Anyway, the point to be
brought out, and the assumption

CANNON

“Well, Vd say it's been a rather profitable Rush Week.”

 

' appropriate

upon which we must work, is that
a freshman is a fully grown human
with full ability to examine and eval-
uate,

Secondly, we must note that the
freshman is not unaware of our cus-
toms, traditions, and way of life. It
would seem, in fact, that the fresh-
man is well-versed on the tradi-
tions and customs of Wé&L, as a
good part of freshman camp and the
Tuesday evening orientation sessions
are devoted specifically to educating
the freshman regarding these very
things. Also, we might note that the
freshman can see and perceive—and
he has been seeing and perceiving
for four weeks now. By now, he
must know what is going on and
be aware of our so-called “Way of
Life.”

Armed with the fact that fresh-
man has the ability to perceive and
to conduct himself as any other

adult and with the fact that he is|

aware of W&lL, in all its aspects, we
can move on to the major hypothesis
of this article: that the freshman
need not necessarily accept what he
sees. If he is pleased with what he
does see, fine; if he is not he is free
to express his displeasure and to
work for modification of what he
does not like. He need not necessar-

| ily accept conventional dress and the

speaking tradition, and he may em-
ploy any means that he himself fels
to execute the modifi-
cation he is seeking

Let this fact be remembered and
let no one attempt to impose his
views concerning W&L traditions on
the first year men. This columnist, as

an opponent of conventional dress

man a “baby” and telling him he'd
better speak out against the tradi-
tions or else, And, on the same basis
is hoped that those who favor
conventional dress and its ramifica-
tions will never again use this o
jany other media in an attempt to
impose his views on the freshman by
telling him he is a child and had
better listen
Fortuniately, perhaps we had bet-
er let it be known that the ecus-
toms, traditions, and way of life are
not fixed, supernatural laws. If they

been under inspection. A substan-
tial element rejects them and is seek-
ing their modification; therefore, we
are not even sure that these cus-
toms will survive this academic year.
How the hell, then, can we tell the
freshmen that there are rigid laws
which they must obey—whether
they approve or not? The freshman
himself will be instrumental in de-
ciding the outcome of the conflict.

The rate of assimilation, then, de-
pends upon the individual. If one
upperclassman accepts conventional
dress, he must, according to his con-
science, assimilate a violator of the
tradition. If, on the other hand, an
upperclassman is among those who
reject conventional dres, then he, ac-
cording to his conscience, has no ob-
ligation to assimilate a freshman.

As to a freshman, if he accepts
conventional dress and is assimilated,
then he is obligated to live up to the
beliefs he expresses. Again, though,
if a freshman doesn't accept conven-
tional dress and is assimilated, then
he must do what he considers to be
right and must advoeate modifieation
As for a freshman doing the assimi-
lating, the same concept that applies
to upperclassmen applies to him

To conclude, gentlemen, let's be

And finally, Mi

Tyler stated that
however, what all
of this involves. It is more a ques-
tion of respect, both to the Univer-
sity and to each upperclassman.”
Most important of all is Mr. Tyler's
belief that upperclassmen “make cer-
tain that... freshmen show some re-
spect to the upperclassmen, ”

I beg to differ with Mr. Tyler on
this point. In my opinion, respect
is always earned. Never it is pro-
duced through demands, regardless
of the position held by the individual
or group demanding it. Indeed, the
inevitable results of such demands,
if they exerted strongly, are
contempt and fear on the part of
the individual group at which they
are aimed.

I prefer to believe that an upper-
classman’s life at Washington and
Lee is made fruitful and enjoyable
through friendly cooperation with
his fellow students and his profes-
sors. We are supposedly gentlemen,
and I should like to point out to Mr.
Tyler that a gentleman does not de-
mand respect, but instead merits it
by dint of his gentlemanly traits.
Gentlemen teach others by example,
not by verbal exhortations. In fact,
1 gentleman should net even trouble
himself with such a matter, for to
prompt foreibly an air of deference
is an act unbecoming a gentleman,
and more befitting a bully.

Varsity Squad Plays
R-M Booters Toda

Hoping for good weather, the
Washington and Lee varsity soccer
team will take the field against
Randolph-Macon today at 3:15 p.m.
The Yellow Jackets will be out for
revenge for the two losses suffered
at the hands of W&L last year.

Coach Joe Lyles revealed that
Randolph-Macon will be improved
last year. “They are getting
better and better, as they get more
boys from the East. They also have
a fine coach, ‘Mutt’ Werner, and we
expect a tremendous hustle and a
sharp passing game from them.”

This will be the home opener for
the Generals, who enter the game
with a 2-1 season, and the first game
of the season for Randolph-Macon.
Lyles commented that the Yellow
Jackets, like Lynchburg College, em-
ploy a short passing attack along

Dear Mom...

Dear Mom and Dad (my parents get
upset when I don’t write, but they
do have a subscription),

 

As a result of an overbundance of
ads and a desire to avoid competition
with the New York Times, last
week's R-t P was cut, even our fav-

With rain predicted for this after-
noon, Lyles expressed a hope that
good weather would prevail. “Since
both schools rely upon a passing at-

tack and try to control the ball as
much as possible good weather will
make for a better game on both
sides,” he said.

After splitting their first two
games, the Generals have shown

good potentio! along with outstand-
ing performances. Lyles cited Tim! 9
Henry, who leads the squad in scor-
ing with with
Fred Skinner, who scored the only
goal in a 1-0 victory over Belmont
Abbey of North Carolina. He
singled out freshman Scott Fechnay
and Fred Fletcher for praise in theit
first inter-collegiate games.

Despite the fact the W&L

championship team, the coach refus-
es to characterize this as a year for
rebuilding. “Although we lost some
boys last year, we’re going to lose
just as many at the end of this year.
If anything, next year will be a re-
building year for us.”

Having started practice Monday,
September 6, the freshman football |
team has progressed to the point
where Coaches Swan and Payne feel |
extremely happy with their charges’
advancement. They've managed to
overcome the intricacies of the
Washington and Lee go-T formation,
a very tough offense which is es-
| pecially hard for inexperienced play-
| ers to master. The team is composed
lof men with outstanding back-
grounds and promising potential, and
with the increased tempo of last
week’s practices the abilities of the
players have begun to materialize.

 

Lyles expressed hope for the sea-
son by saying, “Even with our in-
experienced boys just up from the
freshmen on the squad, we expect a
good year. This is a good group and
they won't be disappointing.”

switched to fullback from halfback
and are progressing very nicely.

The test will come Saturday when
the squad travels to Woodberry For-
est for the first of a tough six game
schedule. Coaches Swan and Payne
feel that the squad is emotionally
ready and that the upcoming con-
test will provide the action the play-
ers need.

Last weekend Woodberry Forest
defeated a strong Collegiate School
of Richmond team 21-6, and appear-
ed quite impressive in their victory.
Their boys have played together for
several years and should be well
versed in Woodberry’s pro-type of-
fense. Washington and Lee has been
working on a defense, however, that
they feel can stop the Woodberry
attack. If our own attack can jell
against the tough Forester defense,
which has allowed us but one touch-
down in the last four years, W&L
should pose a considerable threat to
the Woodberry squad.

Next Friday the team returns home

for an encounter with Fishburne
Military School. All students and

faculty are encouraged to attend and
boost this fine young club, which
promises to be one of the best fresh-
man squads in the last several years
of Washington and Lee history.

Generals Plan Defeat
For Hampden-Sydney

By ANDY LUPTON
The Generals travel to Hampden-
Sydney this weekend for a game

‘|! which ought to put in sharper pers-

pective 1965's football fortunes.
Last week we picked Washington
and Lee over Randolph-Macon and
were proved wrong. However, the
brand of football played in the
opener was better than during most

‘|of last season, Consequently, W&L
.|should pull together as a team and

edge Hampden-Sydney on Saturday
afternoon.

Frosh Soccer Team
Displays Impressive Talent
In Win Over A. M. A,

The frosh soccer team, under the
direction of Bruce Jackson, opened
their nine-game schedule against
Military Academy with a _ rousing
4-0 triumph. Playing at Augusta in
Staunton, the first-year eleven com-
pletely dominated the action, con-
tinually driving at the opponent's
goal. They finally penetrated the net
in the first, second, and fourth quar-
ters as Jack Smith, Joe Horowitz,
and Hank Grady rammed home
goals. Smith, scoring twice, shone
particularly. A fine defense consist-
ing of Mike Hirsh, John Simmons,
and John Burt along with goalies
Grey Hesson and Mark Faverman

foiled A.M.A.’s futile attempts to
score.
Now that Coach Jackson has a

workable nucleus, the team ought
to show even more improvement,
characterized by sharper passing
and deft footwook. Jackson, a first
year law student at W&L, was a
standout member of last year’s var-
sity and received all-state honors
three years in a row.

Jack Smith and Brook Hines were
elected co-captains for the coming
season.

The freshmen play their next game
against the Lynchburg College junio:
varsity on Thursday, October 7 at
Lynchburg.

Better Things lor Better Living
through hemiatry

This season’s schedule doesn’t fea-
ture any pushovers, yet even if it
| did, H-S could not considered
one of them. In their opening game
they were whipped by a really good
Guilford team, 28-3. Last weekend
Hampden-Sydney trailed Bridge-

be

water 7-0 at the half, but came back
to win 14-7 with some excellent
football in the second half. The

Tigers have two dangerous backs in
Lipscomb and Tysinger that any
college team in Virginia would be
glad to list on its roster. Thus Wash-
ington and Lee’s defensive unit faces
a severe test. Still, the defense did
a yeoman’s job last week and prom-
ises to improve against Hampden-
Sydney.

W&L offense though presents a
bigger problem. Randolph-Macon ar-
rived here with a really fine defense,
equally adept at handing a ground or
passing attack. We were simply
throttled. The Generals experienced
difficulty with interior line blocking
last wek. Hopefully a week of work
will show some improvement. A few
properly thrown blocks could dispel
fears of offensive impotency.

The Macon game was the season's
first so obviously mistakes were ex-
pected. Yet, a good group of sopho-
mores capitalized on actual game ex-
pierence. If the Generals can hold
Tysinger, they'll hold Hampden-
Sydney. So here’s stretching that
limb a little further... W&L by a
touchdown, probably 14-7.

In last years’ game between the
two squads, the Generals came off
on the short end of a 21-0 score.
The Generals haven't beaten Hamp-
den-Sydney since 1962.

about 4,000 volumes, including books |
on “every subject from art to witeh- |

Henry E. Coleman,

The collection was bequeathed to
Washington and Lee under the will
of an alumnus, the late Carter N.
Bealer of Washington, D.C. Mr.
Bealer, a graduate of the class of
1922, was an editorial writer for the
Department of Agriculture. Accord-
ing to Mr. Coleman, his library was
remarkable for the variety of inter-
ests represented as well as for the
thoroughness with which they were
covered,

Among the subjects in which Mr.
Bealer was particularly interests
were cats, boating and the sea, and
nature. The collection also contains
many volumes on painting tech-
|niques and several books of limer-
icks.

Also included is a large number
of works on the theater, many of
which McCormick Library has not
possessed until now. These, together
with Mr. Bealer’s outstanding col-
lection of theater programs, will be
|made available to the students in
| the History of the Theater course.

The books will appear on the regu-
‘lar library shelves as they are cata-
|logued, Mr. Coleman said. He em-
| phasized that his staff had barely
| had time to scratch the surface, say-
| ing that he was not really sure what
they would find, but that in any case,
|Mr. Bealer’s bequest was a major
| addition to the library's resources.
