Kendrick and Wade Win;

Steinger & Nash Elected

By JOHN CARRERE
The fervor and excitement of the last week was finally
climaxed last night with the announcement of election results.
President Fred Mindel read Monday’s tallies to a small group
of candidates and supporters gathered in the Student Union.
With the addition of seven victorious candidates, next year’s
Executive Committee has now been nearly filled. The election

of one freshman

undergraduate and law

be held early next fall. The student

government of 1965-67 now stands

at 10, the student body officers hav-

ing been previously elected.
Seniors

The rising senior made
close race with its candidates. Sev-
enty-four per cent of the Juniors
saw Bryant Kendrick as a favorite
with a majority of 100 votes. Ken-
drick will be serving his second
term since he was on the E.C. as
a sophomore. Alan Wade, Phi Kap,
will be the other E.C. member, re-
ceiving a total of 88 votes. These
two won over Randy Chitwood and
Mike Saunders, who polled 82 votes
apiece.

Incumbents Lane Steinger, ZBT,
and Richard Nash, Beta, made good
their bids for the junior class rep-
resentatives. Nash, who won with
an impressive 188 votes, will be
making his third appearance on the
E.C., having won also in his fresh-
man year. Jody Kline suffered the
closest setback of the E.C. races, los-
ing to Steinger by a six-vote mar-
gin, 116-110. Dave Johnson finished
with 70 votes. Eighty-four per cent
of therising Juniors cast votes.

Sophomores

Next year the sophomore class
will see new representatives in the
E.C. Doug Hall, Beta, and Fran
Lawrence, Phi Psi, ran out ahead
of the other candidates with 149 and
146 votes, respectively. Defeated in
the race were Pleas Geyer, 126, and
Sam Hinkle 115. The rising Sopho-

Troubs ‘“Three Cuckolds”
To Begin This Wednesday

The Troub Theater began accept-| and decrepit old men of the title. |

Handley,

ing reservations yesterday for its
final production of the 1965-66 sea-
son, The Three Cuckolds, which will
be given tomorrow through Satur-
day.

The reconstruction by
theater historian Leon Katz of an
anonymous 16th century commedia
dell'arte scenario, dealing with the
conspiracies and love affairs of three
old men and their wives, aided and
abetted by the rogue Arlecchino. In
keeping with the loose, freewheel-
ing spirit of the commedia, director
Lee Khan and the cast of six men
and three women have staged the
show with complete disregard for
the laws of realism and subtletly; the
production is pure, fantastic, broad
sex farce.

Jay Cady is featured Arlec-
chino, a role which requires him to
assume a wide variety of outland-
ish and hilarious accents ranging
from Minnie Pearl to Foghorn Leg-
norn and to perform a taxing
of gymnastics.

Damn Well Ought To Be

When the Washington and Lee of ten or fifteen years ago
is compared to the University as it is today, the most noticeable
disparity is the change in the student-faculty relationship. As
the year closes, it seems appropriate to offer some comments on
this widening gulf between students and faculty.

Dean Emeritus Frank J. Gilliam is fond of explaining his
title in the following manner: ‘Emeritus can be broken down
into its two Latin roots; e, meaning ‘out,’ as in ‘out of a job,’
and meritus, meaning ‘damn well ought to be.’ ”’ Dean Gilliam
while certainly not yet out of a job, represents for us what the
history and tradition of the University demand that a faculty
member had “‘damned well ought to be.”

Several students have undertaken to assay just what is
wrong with Washington and Lee, but we believe they have suc-
ceeded in only touching on the periphery of the problem. The
University was considered great on several occasions during the
last century, even when not a pioneer in higher education.
What, then, was responsible for this greatness? We feel it
was great because of its atmosphere and the men it turned
out. Further, we believe that this atmosphere was created and
the human product molded by nothing so much as by the
faculty.

This faculty contribution is powerful, but subject to change.
And as it changes, so changes the institution. Washington and
Lee will never be a secluded haven devoted to research and
scholarly meditation, like many larger universities, nor should
it reasonably aspire to this status. Washington and Lee is a
teaching institution, the success of which is predicated upon the
interest in the student displayed by each faculty member. The
greatness of the University, at least in this connection, is de-
pendent therefore on the greatness of each individual profes-
sor.

By no means do we deny student responsibility for the
future and well-being of the University. They must feel a com-
mitment to both the institution and the faculty, just as the
faculty must be involved with them and the University. Never-
theless, the burden falls primarily on the faculty, and not on
the students who are only their “temporary” colleagues.

Great teachers are those who exercise the greatest con-
structive influence upon their students; who take a personal
interest in their lives, other than the perfunctory concern
necessitated by falling grades or rules infractions. These great
teachers are friends to their students: they are knowable as
well as knowledgeable and do not disdain to descend from their
ivory towers of academic aloofness. This must not be inter-
preted, however, as a mandate for some of the molly-coddling
and spoon-feeding in which some teachers persist, and which
may be as much an evil as no contact at all.

This great teacher is slowly vanishing from Washington
and Lee. We submit that even now there are more nine-to-five,
workaday teachers at Washington and Lee than we can safely
afford. Happily, these distant faculty members are a minor-
ity; a minority which insists upon its right to isolation. But
this right is invalid, and cannot be protected.

What can be done toremedy this aloofness? To be sure
there is no pressure to publish-or-perish, and the system of
departmental advisers for majors contribute to increased
student-faculty contact. But programs such as the freshman
advisers badly need overhauling, and the entire concept of
assigning advisers must be reevaluated. However, the final
solution is not to be found in these measures. Reform can only
come from the top.

Students really do want to be friends with their professors,
and do very have a real desire to know and be known by their
deans and administratiors. In too many instances, though they
are denied this beneficial association which has so well served
their University for so long.

It is their earnest wish, we believe, to become acquainted
with their President and the deans. They want to be proud
of their school, yet how can they when there is no opportuni-
ty to identify with its leadership? Students are singularly un-
impressed by the organizational capability of the men run:
ning the University. They cannot appreciate administrative
skill; they are impressed only by a knowable, flesh-and-blood
human whom they can like. But there appears to be a reluct-
ance on the part of Administration to establish this relation-
ship. Whether restrained from doing so by personal shyness,
lack of time, or even a vague fear of the students’ reaction,
they do have a very definite responsibility to make them-
selves available and approachable, which surely must take pre-
cedence.

It rests with the faculty to resolve this identity crisis. They
must decide whether the extra effort is to be expended to pre-
serve the Washington and Lee which is slowly disappearing.
This characterictic personal relationship between student and
teacher, based on friendship and mutual respect, must be re-
initiated by the faculty; the students’ fear of being obsequious
is too considerable for it to be otherwise. By the same token,
the students must examine their motives and aims in relation
to the faculty. Many faculty members shy away from involve-
ment with students because of the apple-polishing tendency of
some to view relations with the faculty as only another oppor-
tunity to impress the teacher for a grade.

 

We sincerely hope that the great teachers at W&L are not

members of a dying species. Their passing should be an ignoble
waste, especially since the tradition they represent has pros
pered in harder times than these. If nothing else be accom-
plished at Washington and Lee, at least we should preserve
this ideal of the faculty as it had “damn well ought to be.”

Oldest W&L Tradition Is Questioned By EC Member

The following are the results of
a poll taken this past week. The

iors in three different fraternities,
one perennially among the best fra-
ternities academically, one consist-
ently at the bottom, and the third
usually somewhere in the middle.

*7—No answer.

About the Poll
Perhaps the first thing which needs
to be said is that this poll is not of-
fered as an infallible measure of stu-
dent opinion. There are a number
of criticisms which might be made,
not the least of which are the sub-
jective nature of the questions and
the comparatively small number of
those polled. Although the poll has
these and other limitations, there are
a number of conclusions which
might nevertheless, be adduced.
Principal among these is that the
honor system is in sufficient trouble

to warrant our attention.

Question No. 1

The first question is rather aca-
demic; simply, “Have you commit-
ted a violation of the honor sys-
tem as it is generally defined?” I
don’t think that anyone can fairly
deduce from the responses to this
question that our honor system is
“dead,” that most students merely
pay lip service to it. All that the
answers to question number 1 indi-
cate is that Washington and Lee
student is like every other student,
that he will upon occasion succumb
to temptation, and that like all men,
he is not endowed with an “abso-
lute” sense of honor.

Question No. 2

The second question (“Have you
violated what you conceive to be
the spirit of the honor system?) in-
dicates, I believe, that many stu-
dents do not think that all techni-
cal breaches of the honor system
should be considered violations, that
there is considerable difference be-
tween a flagrant violation of honor
and a relatively minor one, But
there is one disconcerting note in
that better than twenty per cent
of those polled believe there to be
no underlying spirit to the honor
system. Whether this is attributable
to a feeling of disillusionment with
the honor system or with opposition
to the principle of a honor system
is difficult to determine.

Third and Fourth Questions

I think that the responses to these
questions are significant to note.
Although it is extremely difficult to
know if you would or would not
report a close friend of yours for a
violation of the honor system until

26 13

you are actually confronted with
such a situation. I think that the
results do give cause to pause and
ponder the condition of the honor
system. I do believe that the major-
ity of us are aware of fraternity
brothers or friends who have vio-
lated the honor system and yet have
failed to report such violations. If
the honor system is to work effec-
tively, the student must recognize it
as his to operate, and that its en-
forcement is his responsibility alone.

Idealistically, the student ought to
conceive of honor as a transcendent
value taking precedence over person-
al friendship. The student simply
cannot punish dishonor in one quar-
ter and ignore it altogether in an-
other. Responsibility often implies
tasks which are personally distaste-
ful, but these responsibilities must

(Editor’s Note: Dean Frank J.
Gilliam has been a member of the
Washington and Lee University
administration since 1931. He orig-
inally joined the faculty in 1926
as an assistant professor of Eng-
lish, gaining promotion to associate
professor in 1928.

He became the University’s
Dean of Students in 1931, a posi-
tion he held until February, 1962,
when he asked to devote his full-
time efforts to the Washington and
Lee’s admissions program. Mr, Gil-
liam had been handling admis-
sions for a number of years. He
retired as Dean of Admissions in
June of 1963 and was named Dean
Emeritus by the University’s Board
of Trustees. He still serves the
University in an advisory capaci-
ty.)

In a recent interview with the
Ring-tum Phi Dean Frank J. Gil-
liam gave his opinions on some re-
cent developments on the Washing-
ton and Lee campus and on changes
that have occurred in students sen-
timents.

Initially, in a discussion of the
proposed independent study plan,
he gave a mild endorsement to the
program. “By and large, if a col-
lege can have such a program for
a limited number of competent stu-
went, integrated with the regular
degree requirements, it would be a
good thing.”

be discharged nevertheless. The typi-
cal student at Washington and Lee
does not share this view; he does not
conceive it as his duty to demand
“absolute honor from those with
whom he associates. Ironically, how-
ever, he expects a wholly different
code of behavior from those whom
he doesn’t know or personally dis-
likes. There is also this disquieting
implication—that the honor system
may be used to discriminate against
the unpopular few. The honor sys-
is, in effect, suggesting to one group
of persons that they must be more
circumspect in their ethical behav-
ior than another group. Obviously,
this is not a failure of the honor
system, but of those charged with its
administration, without whose co-
operation the honor system cannot

 

possibly survive.

On the topic of integration at
Washington and Lee, Dean Gilliam
remarked that it is “an inevitable
development.” “W&L will, at some-
time in the future, enevitably oper-
ate on an integrated basis, in fact
as well as in theory,” he stated.

Commenting on a recent Ring-tum
Phi column which concerned sub-

Adherence To Honor System Polled

The Fifth Question

The fifth question indicates that
there are a great number of students
who observe violations, but fail to
report them. Since the students
themselves are primarily responsible
for enforcing the honor system, it
would appear that the honor sys-
tem suffers sorely from their failure
to acknowledge their responsibility.

The Sixth Question

Perhaps the most significant re-
sponse was to the sixth question.
Over seventy per cent of the stu-
dents polled indicated that they felt
that the absolute penalty was “un-
just,” and that a modification of the
penalty, which would differentiate
between habitual violators and those
who were suspected of the their
first violations, and between blatant

tions—of not paying students to take
part in athletics was sound; but
that we might well consider paying
a few boys to play football and
basketball. My remark was that it
was reminiscent of the proverbial
young lady who wanted to be only
a tiny bit pregnant.”
Conventional Dress

“On the matter of conventional
dress, I think that everyone who
has been on the Washington and Lee
campus for an extended number of
years would feel that conventional
dress is not one of the eternal
verities of the institution but that it
has been a positive, worthwhile as-
set almost impossible to exaggerate.”
Dean Gilliam continued, “My own
hope is that a sufficient number of
Washington and Lee students, in
practice as well as in the theory,
will feel that loyalty to Washington
and Lee’s best interests outweighs
any thought of personal privilege in-
volved.”

Regarding an effective means of
enforcement, he commented, “The
example set by the great majority of
students who are looked up to and
respected as citizens is, in my judg-
ment, the strongest possible medium
through which conventional dress
will be continued. ”

Blanchard Praises Rider
For Holding Individualism

To the Editor:

In reading through last Tuesday's
edition of the Ring-tum Phi, I was
struck by an article which differed
in a unique manner from all others
in the paper. It differed by iis be-
ing an example of clear thought, of
honesty, and strong-mindedness.

Bruce Rider's articles continually
shine through as the brightest spots
in the Ring-tum Phi. I can only
wonder how he, as an upperclass-
man at Washington and Lee, has
managed to keep his open and sane
mind

I am amazed that he has come
this far at Washington and Lee and
is still able to think and write as

Swim Coach, Trainer
To Attend Fla. State

By CHARLIE FRERET

Washington and Lee will soon be looking for a new swim-
ming coach and trainer. Norris Wilder Eastman, who has
filled these two capacities for the past eight years, is leaving
to attend Florida State University next fall to study for his
doctorate in Physical Education.

Coach Eastman is married to the former Beverley Brick and
has three children—Norris, Jr.. Jace-#—-—-
queline, and Scot. Since coming to
Washington and Lee to catch, East-

 

man has become an integral part of
the University. His activities read
like a book. He has been: assistant
professor of physical education; di-
rector of correctives and adapted
physical education; head trainer for
all sports; and organizer and super-
visor of Student Trainer Organiza-
tion. He has been water safety in-
structor trainer, supervisor of W&L
acquatics, head swimming coach,
and director of Physical Fitness Test-
ing Program.

On the teaching side he has been a
lecturer in kinesiology, anatomy, and
Physical Education Techniques, Phil-
osophy, and Programming. He is a
member of the University Student
Health Committee; co-Chairman of
the State of Virginia Advisory Swim-
ming Committee; a member of the
National Trainers Association;
member of AAHPER; and faculty
advisor to the Dance Board.

A standout at Lawrence High in
football, baseball, and basketball in
Falmouth, Massachusetts, Coach
Eastman became a fine swimmer at
Springfield College in Springfield,
Massachusetts, where he received his

Outstanding Seniors
Bow Out At WG L

 

Since arriving on the W&L cam-
pus, Dave Kirkpatrick has develop-
ed into an out-
standing athlete.
The son of Mr.
» and Mrs. F. Syn-
| dor Kirkpatrick of
| Madison, New
Jersey, Dave came
from Madison
High where he
was a standout in
both baseball and
soccer. He made
both varsity
squads his fresh-

Kirkpatrick
man year at W&L, but it wasn’t un-
til his sophomore year that be began
to make a name for himself.

In the fall of 1963 he won a start-

ing position on the soccer team,
proving a valuable asset; and in the
spring he took over
the baseball team, leading the team
in stolen bases and batting with a
390 average.

In his junior and

senior years

Dave has continued his fine record. |
During his Junior year he paced the |

soccer team to a second place in the

NCAA tournament, and was chosen |

for All-Virginia second team. This

shortstop for |

|e started strong in baseball his
| Junior year but was released before
the CAC tournament. Determined to
make amends he came back this
spring and has once again proved
his worth.

Coach Joe Lyles has been Dave's
coach in both sports and is high
in his praise of Dave’s abilities. He
feels that Dave is one of the best
players he has had at W&L. He
thinks Dave’s fine soccer ability as
a dribbler and a breaker can be
attributed to his “tremendous body
balance,” speaking of Dave as con-
tinually a threat with the ball be-
cause he has “dynamite in both
feet.” In baseball Coach Lyles calls
Dave a good line-drive hitter who
seldom strikes out. Dave's rifle
arm enables him to make difficult
plays look easy at short.

Dave is a member of Pi Kappa
| Alpha and a European History ma-
jor. He has been on the Dean’s List
|and would like to attend W&L Law
School, but upon graduation he is
due to receive his commission in
the Marine Corps, to be stationed
at Quantico. Dave ends his athletic
career with the C.A.C. tournament
|in St. Louis.

Mathews, Crosland
Top Golf Performers

By RAY ZELTNER
Although not playing up to expectations, the Washing-
ton and Lee golf team finished fourth yesterday in the Virginia
State Intercollegiate Golf Tournament at the Cascades in Hot
Springs.
Leading the team were Captain Ed Crosland and Freshman

Bobby Mathews, shooting 164’s. They were followed by Junior

Lacrosse Lost

Saturday on a rain-soaked Wilson
field, the Washington and Lee la-
crosse team was defeated by a pol-
ished squad from Washington Col-
lege, 18-4. The score is a deceptive
one; the Generals battled the visitors
into the third quarter before a sud-
den barrage of goals by Washington’s

star attackman put the game out of
reach. Coach Swan lauded the
squad’s first half performance as

the finest effort by
recent years.

Billy Andrews led the charge
which had the visitors awe-struck
with a meagre 4-2 halftime lead. It

was Andrews who scooped up a ball
early in the third period and raced
in to rally the Generals’ third goal.
However, the relentless attack of
second-team All-American Jaegar,
high-scoring Ren Regan, and Ort-
man, devastated the tired Generals in

 

the final periods.

the third consecutive year by V.P.L,
with U.Va. and V.M.I. taking sec-
ond and third. V.P.I.’s Tim Collins
was the individual medalist with a
two-over-par 144. Considering the
rainy weather, which has plagued
six of the last seven matches, the
scores were reasonably low.
Friday Victories

Last Friday the golf team scored
victories over Lynchburg and Roa-
noke College in a tri-match at the
Lexington Country Club. Mathews
led the team scoring with 72. Cros-
land and Fulwider followed with
73’s. Lynchburg was defeated 412-

In a season including three losses
in seven matches, the golf team is

ward to possible victories in the

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Edward Brooke May Be Elected

(Continued from page 2)
“No” to the K.K.K,

Mr. Brooke, a self-proclaimed Re-
publican “liberal” in terminology
that since November of 1964 has be-
come almost devoid of meaning, has
“a gift for political service,” says
one observer who would rather
speak of a “Keating” or even a
“Javits” type Republican than a “lib-
eral.” Brooke’s capabilities cannot be
denied. His ability is recognized by
Democrats as well as Republicans;
under his leadership, Massachusetts
has been “cleaned up” more exten-
sively and more effectively in the
three-plus years past than through-
out the rest of the century.

Neither can his sympathies be re-
jected. His vigorous refusal to sup-
port Goldwater-Miller in ’64, his
statement that “I don’t believe I'd
care to be endorsed by the Ku Klux
Klan, nor will I go out of my way
to get the blessings of the Com-
munist party are demonstrative of
his political independence, of the at-
titude finally being recognized as
essential to two-party politics in New
England.

Brooke is more than a symbol of
new Republicanism in New England;
he is showing that now “you don’t
need Mayflower ancestral creden-
tials; you don’t have to be a mem-
ber of the Somerset Club or even
the Chamber of Commerce, to win
in the Republican party.” He has
moved up from scorn because of his
African and Indian ancestry, to the

 

Dean Gilliam Interview

retiring, I have not felt an obligation
to look at a copy of the Southern
Collegian in the past three years.
For several years preceding, I had
seen little in the Southern Collegian
that I thought justified its existence.

Continuing his discussion of the
student publication situation, Dean
Gilliam concluded that he thought
the Ariel had shown itself to be a
publication worthy of financial sup-
port by the University.

presidency of the Boston Opera
Company and general respect in all
of New England.

“For All the Peoples”

Perhaps the telling point of
Brooke’s political attractiveness is
his personal victory over the inevi-
table “Uncle Tom-ism” charge
brought early in his career. “Of
course I am a Negro, and I have a
great deal of pride in my race. But
I see myself as the attorney general
for all the peoples; the moment I
become specifically a Negro attorney
general, I squander whatever effec-
tiveness I might have....” There is
little room for retort.

Edward William Brooke will be
the Republican party’s most interest-
ing candidate this fall; more import-
antly, he will undoubtedly be one of
the strongest, personally and politi-
cally, that the party can offer. His
candidacy in itself, and his far-from-
remote chance of victory are prov-
ing to be not only vital and refresh-
ing for Massachusetts Republican-
ism, but also an example in repair-
ing and renovating the G.O.P.
throughout New England.

ways for the worse. My opponent,
as we all know, has not yet spoken
to this side of the question at all.

“When I am elected I want you all
to know that I will take appropriate
action. You have my word on that.

“We have before us many issues
of importance. Junior year abroad.
Independent study plan. Integration.
I propose to combine these noble
goals, and to integrate and send the
Negroes abroad for Inedependent
study.

“My friends, back a winner. I am
not unmindful of the future. Nor of
the past. Nor of the present. Vote
for the Forward-Backward ticket to
help make Washington and Lee what
it is today.”

With this platform, my friend, po-
litical success is yours. And what

 

could be more important?

 

Andrew Is Subject Of Article

(Continued from page 3)
One of the most unrecognized,
outstanding Senior athletes is Jamie
Andrew. The son
— of Mr. and Mrs.
T. G. Andrew of
Baltimore, Md.,
Jamie came to
Washington and
Lee from Gilman

School in Balti-
more, where he
amassed twelve

in football, wrest-
ling, and lacrosse.

Starting with his
Freshman year
Jamie has compiled quite a record
at W&L. He has played three years
of varsity football after a year on
the freshman team. He has wrestled
for four years and was co-captain
this past year. Jamie also played
freshman lacrosse but decided to
forego it after his first year. Yet, now
he helps to coach the lacrosse “B”
team.

Jamie, an avid sailor and a health
bug (he goes to bed by 9:30 p.m.),
has maintained a Dean’s List aver-
age. He is also social chairman of
Delta Tau Delta. But his most out-
standing achievement is the un-
selfish work he has done at the
Waddell Elementary School here in
Lexington. Jamie is a phys. ed.
instructor there and devotes every
afternoon for “his boys.” Jamie has
been like a father to these boys and
his work has begun what may some-
day be called a Boy's Club in Lex-
ington.

violations and relatively minor ones,
would be preferable.
The Seventh Question

The answers to the seventh ques-
tion suggest a possible solution to
the problems previously uncovered.
Over sixty per cent of the students
indicated that they would be more
willing to report violators if the
penalty to be meeted out were less
severe. Of the thirty per cent who
replied “no,” many simply would not
turn in violators under any circum-
stances, while to some the nature
of the penalty would make little or
no difference.

The Absolute Penalty

It would seem, therefore, that the
problem of our honor system cen-
ters primarily around the absolute
penalty. It is obvious that the ma-
jority of students considers it too
severe, especially for persons com-
miting their first violation. The ab-
solute penalty appears to be the
principal reason why a large percent-
age of the student body refuses to
fulfill their obligations under the
honor system. Based simply on the
results of the poll, it appear that
the student body would be more
willing to discharge their respon-
sibilities if a modification of the ab-
solute penalty were to be made.

summer swimming team. He plans
on being at Florida State for two
years while studying exercise phys-
iology in swimming. Specifically, this
is the determination of the amount
of energy required for various forms
of survival swimming. The Navy
Department has expressed interest in
this aspect of the program.

In an interview with Coach East-
man, he revealed that the decision
was a particularly hard one to make.
Although he regrets leaving Wash-
ington and Lee, he felt it is an op-
portunity he must pursue. He hopes
to be able to return to the Univer-
sity in two years.

Lee Reveals Honor System Poll

Some will doubtless argue that,
should the absolute penalty be sus-
pended, no deterrant would remain
to discourage students from com-
mitting honor violations. This would,
prima facie, appear to be a legitimate
contention, but I tend not to think
so. First, it has been established that
someone does not violate a law or
convention unless there is a reason-
able chance that he will not be
caught. The individual rarely re-
flects on the severity of a punish-
ment, but on the possibility of be-
ing detected and reported. Each step
which maximizes the individual’s
chances of being reported helps to
discourage honor vilations, and a
modification of the absolute penalty
would seem to accomplish this.

(Bob Lee will continue his an-
alysis of his poll next week, with
an examination of “The Abso-
lute Penalty.”

Executive Committee Elections

(Continued from Page 1)

Gil Faulk was victorious in the
law school and will likewise be on
the E.C, next year.

The present Executive Committee
also had some success on Monday.
Its amendment concerning write-in
ballots passed the student body with
a 689-122 count. This action was
spurred by the recent doubt raised
during the student body presidential
election which saw president-elect
Bill Jeffress opposed by a number
of such votes.

The council’s new members will
not enter their terms officially until
next year. However, it is customary
for next year’s E.C. to meet and
shape policies which would be fol-
lowed next fall. Their most imme-
diate concern will be the appoint-
ment of students to the four stand-

 

ing committees: the Library Commit-
tee, The Student Control Committee,
the Assimilation Committee, and the
Cold Check Committee. This will
be done sometime next week.

 

Notice

Dean Pusey’s office has announced
that returning students must register
for both semesters next year on
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
of next week.
