Commerce School Releases

Self Study Program Report

The School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration released Wednesday to
both faculty and students a prelim-
inary report of the self study pro-
gram conducted within it. Under-
taken in conjunction with the Uni-
versity wide self study effort, the
Commerce School's inquiry has ben
underway for almost a year.

The immediate purpose of the self
study, as delineated by Professor
John M. Gunn, Jr., analyst for the
School of Commerce, centers upon
fulfilling the accreditation require-
ments of the Southern Association of
Colleges and Schools. A_ regional
agency recognized by the National
Commission on Accrediting, the As-
sociation demands of schools seeking

ODK, EC Agree To Accept
Modification of Leadership
Forum; VP’s Excluded

The Executive Committe’s plan
for the re-organization of the ODK
Leadership Forum has been accepted
by ODK with little modification,
Student Body President Fred Mindel
announced Tuesday.

The only change voted by ODK
and accepted by the E.C| at its
Tuesday meeting is in the structure
of the Forum’s Council. Under this
revision, undergraduate Class Vice-
Presidents wili not sit on the Coun-
cil; three instead of two officers of
ODK will—reducing the size of the
Council from nineteen to fourteen.
Others who will be part of the
Council are the four undergraduate
Class and three law Class presidents,
two representatives from the E.C.,
one from the Independent Union,
and one from the IFC. The Council
will act as the supervisory body of
the Forum proper, which will be
open to all students and faculty
interested. In addition to deciding
which of the topics suggested to it
by students, faculty, campus organ-
izations, and the E.C. merit discus-

accreditation a self study program
conducted once every ten years.
Professor Gunn was quick to point
out that neither the University nor
the School of Commerce would limit
the aims and extent of the self study
to the specific requirements of the
Association.

Gunn Discuses Issues

In a series of public meetings
with faculty and students, Professor
Gunn discussed the issues and im-
plications raised by the report. The
meetings were directed toward in-
forming particularly the
body with the problems encounter-
ed and presenting students with the
opportunity of offering solutions and
suggestions. Only five students,
though, appeared at each of the ses-
sions.

The report, itself, is divided into
four principal areas of consideration.

The first area deals with objec-
tives of the School of Commerce. As
expressed in the preliminary report,
the School basically “strives to blend
academic excellence and moral in-
tegrity, fortified by self-confidence,
self-discipline, and large vision, and
enriched with taste, courtesy, and a
touch of graciousness.” The faculty
believes that the educational exper-
ience ought to be viewed in a very
“broad context.” Professor Gunn
stressed, however, that the objectives
of the School of Commerce ulti-
mately correspond with the Univer-
sity’s objectives. As of yet, the
University Self Study Committee has
not issued a definite report on those
objectives.

Graduate Records Analyzed

The second area of examination
centers upon the students enrolled
in the School. The most recent data
indicates that approximately 75 per
cent of its graduates continue their
education on the graduate school
level. Although a small percentage
of men enter graduate study in one
of the fundamental intellectual dis-
ciplines offered by the Commerce

Three committee appointments, a
report from the Library Committee,
and discussion of the Saturday
classes poll highlighted this week’s
meeting of the EC,

Freshman Jack Carithers, a Phi
Gam pledge from Jacksonville, was
named to the Assimilation Commit-
tee. In his statement to the EC.,
Carithers commented that he would
like to see the basic traditions of
the University continued, with per-
haps a liberalization of the conven-
tional dress regulations at night. Ap-
pointed to the University Commit-
tee on Athletics were Chuck Long,
Beta senior from Dallas, and Lee
Johnson, Delt senior of Louisville.
The Committee on Athletics, com-
posed of two student body members,
five faculty members and two alum-
ni, schedules all intercollegiate sports
activities, submits an athletic bud-
get to the Board of Trustees, and as-
sists the Administration in the selec-
tion of coaches and athletic direc-
tors.

A progress report from Library
Committee chairman Randy Chit-
wood noted that students have been
taking good advantage of the new
policy of keeping the stacks open
during dinner. Within two weeks,
the report stated, the Library will
begin opening earlier on Sundays,
probably at 1.30. Presently, it opens
at 3,00. The Library Committee is
expecting recommendations for new
activity and a specific determination
of the question of the areas of its
jurisdiction in the forthcoming Self-
Study Committee. Chitwood further
reported that the Library Commit-
tee would like to institute a used-
book exchange second semester, as a
more efficient and organized means
of determining who has which
second-hand look to sell than present
practice of posting notices on the
ODK bulletin board, and to bring
higher returns for books than are
given when they are sold to pub-
lishers’ representatives through the
Co-op. In matters of discipline, the
Library Committee is considering
possible higher fines, since com-
plaints are increasing, especially in
respect to reserved books, with the
possibility of referring flagrant vio-
lators to the E.C. A suggestion box
has been placed in the library, but
will shortly be replaced by a larger,
more noticeable one.

Discussing the Saturday classes
poll conducted a week ago Wednes-
day, the E.C. decided that since less
than half of the student body voted
at all, the results are not valid

student opinion to interpret. Of the

of abolishing all Saturday classes;
358 (57 per cent) wanted to retain
them. Richard Nash, Sophomore E.C.
representative and Chairman of the
Committee investigating the Satur-
day class question, noted that many
students felt that the question pre-
sented by the E.C. was worded in a
negative way, but the E.C. had not
intended to give such an impression.
Other E.C. members felt that the
poll might have asked for reasons for
each vote, for opinions, and for other
ideas and alternative suggestions.
Junior class representative Bob Lee
suggested that the E.C. contact other
schools which have a five-day week
to see how the obstacles of schedul-
ing were overcome. E.C. President
Fred Mindel appointed Nash to
head a follow-up committee to pur-
sue the idea. Students will be re-
cruited to work with Nash on the
committee, but not until after
Thanksgiving, because as Nash com-
mented, if work is begun immediate-
ly, students will exclaim, “A new
committee—good, good, but I'm go-
ing home Wednesday!”

The last business of the evening
was the delivery by member Bill
Jeffres of the “Anecdote of the
Week.” Fred Mindel announced that
he is preparing his own anecdote, to
be recited at the next meeting.

Before the meeting was officially
brought to order, a heated debate
was held about members wearing or
not wearing robes for their Calyx
picture. Leading the Pro-Robe Fac-
tion were Richard Nash and Dave
Marchese. The No-Robe opposition,
however, led by Mindel and Joe
Framptom, won its victory when
Framptom asked, “Why wear robes?

(Nine Member Board

To Provide Advice

By SAM McCHESNEY

The Mock Republican National
Convention Interim Co-Ordinating
Committee has chosen nine promi-
nent Republicans to serve on its
National Advisory Board for the up-
coming 1968 Republican Mock Con-
vention.

The members of the Advisory
Board are Bill Brock, Congressman
from the third district of Tennessee;
Everett M. Dirksen, Senator from
Illinois and Senate Minority Lead-
er; William Miller, former Congress-
man and Chairman of the Republi-
can National Committee; William
Scranton, Governor of Pennsylvania;
Robert Smylie, Governor of Idaho;
Mark Hatfield, Governor of Oregon;
Melvin Laird, Congressman from the
seventh district of Wisconsin; Gerald
Ford, Congressman from the fifth
district of Michigan and Minority
leader of the House of Representa-
tives; and Richard H. Poff, Repre-
sentative from the Sixth District of
Virginia.

There are four reasons for organ-
izing this Mock Convention National
Advisory Board. H. Davis Mayfield,
Chairman of the Interim Co-Ordinat-
ing Committee of the Mock Conven-
tion, said as one reason that “our
1968 Convention can be more re-
spected, accurate, realistic, and suc-
cessful if we can depend on the ad-
vice and suggestions of these out-
standing gentlemen over a period of
three years.”

Secondly, the mere use of these
names enables the Mock Convention
to enlist the support of less promi-
nent members of the Republican
Party. The use of such names will
also assist the public relations aspect
of this Mock Convention. News-
papers will be more prone to publi-
cize the Convention knowing that
these nine Republicans are support-
ing the Convention's endeavors.

Lastly the National Advisory
Board will help the Convention to
attract two outstanding republicans
to speak each year during the three-
year interim period.

Besides being a veteran of seven
terms in the House of Representa-
tives, Laird is currently Chairman
of the House Republican Conference,
one of the top leadership positions
in the Republican hierarchy. Made
up of all Republican members of
the House of Representatives, the
Conference Committee is the high-
est policy-making body and is the
body which presides over all or-
ganizational decisions, leadership ap-

pointments, and elections.

 

Gerald Ford has been a member
on the Republican Policy Commit-
tee for seven years and has served
as a member of the joint Senate-
House Republican Leadership since
January, 1963.

As a member of the Government
Operations Committee, Poff played a
prominent part in the investigations
of waste and extravagance, which
saved the government several million
dollars.

Bill Brock is a member of the
Banking and Currency Committee,
which considers legislation dealing
with the Federal Reserve System,
public and private housing, evalua-
tion of the dollar, insurance, and
financial aid to commerce and in-
dustry.

Sen. Everett Dirksen is presently
serving on the Judiciary and Fi-
nance Committees of the Senate. In
addition, he is chairman of the Ju-
diciary Sub-committee on Federal
Charters, holiday and celebrations; is
a member of the Special Committee

Special M ecting
Of Publications
Board is Called

A special meeting of the Publica-
tions Board was called for 4.30 this
afternoon, at which time Journalism
Professor Paxton Davis was expec-
ed to lodge a formal complaint with
the Board protesting certain infer-
ences drawn from Tuesday Ring-tum
Phi editor Mike Hash’s editorial
printed earlier this week, entitled
“People in Glass Houses...”

The editorial commented on an
article which appeared in last Sun-
day's Potomac Magazine supplement
to the Washington Post, written by
Paul Herron, editor of the Potomac.
The article was apparently neither
entirely accurate nor complimentary,
although unintentionally so, to both
the Department of Journalism and to
the Ring-tum Phi. Hash’s editorial
response to the article observed that
“Herron ...obviously relied on the
colored opinions of the Department
of Journalism for his evaluation of
our newspaper” and continued, “It is
no secret that the Reid Hall clique
has a thoroughly condescending at-
titude toward the journalistic qual-
ity of the Ring-tum Phi.”

"..» The Greatest Enterprise in the World”

 

Humphreys Outlines Political Life

Raymond V. Humphreys, the Di-
rector of Political Education and
Training Division of the National
Republican Party, spoke last Thurs-
day night about the “Noblest Career.”

Before an audience of about 100)
students, Humphreys illustrated the
sacrifices, rewards, and qualities of |
political life. “This is a challenge.” |
he said, “but not for weaklings.” |
“Government is the greatest enter-
prise in the world.” “We've got to
look to you (college students),” he |
reminded the audience

 

Due to its very nature, politics is |
a risky profession. Politicians are, ac- |
cording to the speaker, “people who |
are willing to gamble a little bit.”
Quoting from Andrew Oliver, a Bos-
ton patriot of the Eighteenth Cen-
tury, Humphreys stated, “Politics is
the most hazardous of all profes-
sions. There is no other in which a
man can hope to do so much geod
to his fellow creatures—and neither
is there any in which, by mere loss
of nerve, he may do as widespread
harm. With all its temptations and
degradations that beset it, Politics is
still the noblest career any man can
choose.”

Turning his focus to the Republi-
can Party, Humphreys examined the
history of the party and brought to
light its precedent as a progressive
and conscientious party. Te enum-
improvements

 

erated the many in

 

government brought about in this

 

century by the GOP administrations.

Preceding Humphreys’ speech,
during the monthly business meet-
ing, President Roger Wallace report-
ed on the YR contributions to the
Virginia campaign. This year the

 

YR's provided over $450 in contri-
butions and 150 man-hours to the
campaign. Allen Rains, a junior from
Vienna, Virginia, was selected YR
of the month for his outstanding

Misdirected Blame

People in Glass Houses Revisited .. .

 

The Tuesday Editions editorial on the recent article in the
Sunday supplement of the Washington Post has caused quite
a furor on both the first and second floors of Reid Hall. It
seems that a member of the Journalism Department felt the
charges leveled against the J-school unjust, even to the extent
of demanding a Publications Board meeting on the subject
this afternoon at 4:15.

It is our understanding from the author of the editorial,
Mike Hash, that this member of the faculty of the Journalism
School called him on Wednesday, demanding a public apology
for the editorial comment which shows one of General Lee’s
pet projects in a rather unfavorable light.

Hash offered unlimited space for a letter or article in either
edition of the Ring-tum Phi in which the editorial could be re-
butted. He also offered to publish a statement to the effect that
the Department of Journalism and Communications neither
encouraged or promoted the sentiments expressed by Mr. Paul
Herron in his recent article. Both these offers were unaccept-
able to the faculty member.

We can understand the department’s concern, but feel that
Mr. Hash was entirely justified in his right to make his com-
ments Tuesday. We also believe that Hash made every effort
possible to give equal space to the J-school.

We question where Mr. Herron, author of the Post article,
got his information about the Ring-tum Phi. Thus far, how-
ever, no one has admitted to disclosing the tainted information
to Mr. Herron, but we do feel that Mr. Hash had justification
for his, more or less, subjective opinion concerning the origin
of the controversial statement, which later has been cleared of
J-school blame.

It is a well known fact that no love has ever existed be-
tween the students in the two groups. For example, page 22
of the Journalism Handbook points this fact out in the same
type innuendos Mr. Hash was attacked for using.

“The Department has no managerial connection
with, nor responsibility for, student body publications,
the Ring-tum Phi, Southern Collegian, and Calyx. It
desires no responsibility for them unless it can in fact
control and supervise the publications and use them as
workshop projects with professional standards in con-
tent and operation related to the realities of profession-
al, non-campus publishing. As the university has a tra-
dition of “independent” student publications (although
they are not actually immune to administrative con-
trol), use of the publications as training tools is pre-
cluded.”

It is our firm belief that neither the students, faculty, or
administration would like to see the Ring-tum Phi become a
“training tool” of the Department of Journalism.

We also feel, in defense of the department, that if Mr.
Herron were a student here, he would have failed his assign-
ment with flying colors. It was an unfortunate story which
shows Washington and Lee in a bad light, but if anyone should
receive criticism for the gross inaccuracies connected with the
story, it is the Washington Post, specifically Mr. Herron, and
not Mr. Hash.

The result of Mr. Herron’s handiwork here has placed a
lot of innocent people in an embarrassing position. Mr. Hash
possibly should have checked the validity of his statement be-
fore publication, and, by the same token, the journalism pro-
fessor possibly should have reacted more temperately to the
editorial attack which was in no way maliciously directed to
him nor any members of the J-school faculty or administration.

Stuart Reviews “Waiting for Godot”;
Praises Baker, Williams and Direction

By DABNEY STUART
Instructor in English

Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Go-
dot can be a bewildering play. The
reason for this is, I think, that it is
a “literary” play; that is, it depends
on literary tradition, and not simply
a tradition of dramatic literature, for
its effectiveness. This can be speci-
fied in three ways.

Firstly, the play embodies a vision
of man’s place in the world that is
more or less peculiar to the twentieth
century. This vision receives clear
expression in the works of Nietzsche,
Sartre, Dostoyevsky and Camus to
name Beckett's most obvious ante-
cedents with respect to ideas.

This tradition, which, as these
names suggest, is European and not
American, stresses the “death” of
God, or at least His disappearance

 

from man’s world-view, and the

consequent isolation of human be-
ings who longer find comfort and
solace for the tribulations of this
world in terms of the promise of
another. As Beckett dramatizes this
vision in Godot men have ceased to
be pilgrims journeying through one
world to another, and have become
instead waiters, condemned to one
life which, simply, ends. This world
is all they’ve got.

The dramatic tension inherent in
this predicament depends on the
expectations left over from a con-
ception of life’s meaning that is no
longer sufficient, and the absence of
substantial fulfillment of those ex-
pectations. Vladimir and Estragon
still think in Christian terms, still
expect some intervention from a
“Godot” which will “save” them, but,
at the same time, have no confidence
that this intervention will occur. In

 

“A Ticket to Anyplace”

Fleischer Hits

By DAVID FLEISCHER
As I popped another “dex,” I
came to the understanding (“dex”
makes one think 25 per cent clearer)

 

that the good
old red - blooded
American public

(a phrase that can
best be ranked in
the same category
with “motherism”
and “Better dead
than red”) has be-
come creators of a
“pill - poppers -
paradise.” This
holds especially
true for the col-
lege student. He has become associ-
ated with pills to keep him awake,
pills to put him to sleep, pills to
speed up his “inners,” and pills to
slow down the “inners” of his local
lass.

The trend seems to be continuing
in this direction. The United States
Space program can stash all the de-
light of a steak dinner into a tiny
capsule. (It is interesting to note that
the Commons has not yet succeeded
in “stashing” all the delight of a
steak dinner into a real steak.) In
contrast, dietary research can by vir-
ture of a similarly shaped pill, re-
move one’s appetite. (In this field the
Commons has attained greater suc-
cess.) There are now in existence
pills to cure everything from laryn-
gitis to lumbago. We have pills to
make us grow big and strong. We
have pills to seramble the precious
bodily fluids. And we even have
pills to take when other pills do
not do the job. Pills have become
so popular that you can even buy
pillboxes with pictures of Ringo
Starr on the outside. (Is this not a
sign of acceptance?)

 

 

Pill Paradise

Perhaps even a greater mark of
the acceptance of the pill is display-
ed in the embodiment of the “pill
game.” (If we can make a game out
of something, it’s usually pretty
much accepted—the “in” game, cha-
rades, pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.) 1|

 

fact, the evidence—the boy’s re-
ports—indicate that they will wait
without end. The best they can do
is “pass the time,” bored, despair-
ing, yet hanging on in a_ world
where putting on one’s boots and sit-
ting down become acts of supreme
interest.

Secondly, the play depends for
much of its “meaning” on a tradi-
tion of dramatic literature. But,
whereas Beckett employs certain
ideas in the vision the play com-
municates, he works against tradi-
tional uses of the stage. The wall
between audience and actors is brok-
en down, for example, and much of
what happens on stage is intended

hear tell of a game which took place! 77

at some parties in Paris this summer | ,

called the “pill game.” Each guest
is required to bring two different
types of pills to the party—“dex,”
bennies, sominex, birth control pills,
weight control pills, Salk oral vac-
cines, etc. The host places all of the
pills into a hat. Each guest while
blind-folded, draws two pills at ran-
dom.

The idea of dependence on pills
was first expounded by an eminent
Washington and Lee philosophy
professor. Anyone can obtain a pel-
let which can serve as a ticket to
and from anyplace from ecasty to
despair. Modern man seems to be
sloughing off his physical and mental
maintenance. I certainly am not op-
posed to medical and psychological
programs (that woud be un-Ameri-
can) but we seem headed for an age
of pill-ism. (It is characteristic of
“America” to put -“ism” on to the
end of every word that doesn’t
already have -“ism” on it.) The fu-
ture looks finster. Free will is be-
coming naught. Where can we find
the answer? There is only one man
among us all who seems to have the
answer. He has become the epitome
of tranquility. He is to radio what
Ted Mack (and Geritol) are to the
tube. He is to the nervous system
what Speedy (of Speedy Alka Selt-
zer) is to the digestive system. Any-
one would recognize his mellifluous
voice when he greets wou with—
“Hello, folks, I'm Galen Drake. Take

 

Mr. Stuart

to remaind us we are watching
somebody perform in a theater.

For instance, Vladimir goes off-
stage to urinate and Estragon calls
to him, “End of the corridor, on the
left,” jolting us out of the illusion
of a limited “scene”—outdoors some-
where, beside a tree—and reminding
us that we are in a building with
corridors and rooms. And bringing us
to ourselves. Vladimir's comments to

the same effect, and are more point-
edly critical.

Moreover, this technique has a
double effect. While it reminds us
we are in a theater, it also involves
us in the action on the stage. The
dramatie action spills over into the
audience. Brecht and Pirandello are
Beckett's models here.

Thirdly the play is as much about
language itself as about anything
else. This is clearest in Beckett's
use, and parody, of rhetoric. Lucky's
speech is a chaotic conglomeration of
textbook jargon about “big issues”
and social customs—“esse and posse”

digestion and defecation, golf, the

Graduates of Washington and
Lee's Commerce School have gener-
ally posted outstanding records in
many of the nation’s most distin-
guished business schools. The per-
formanee of the School's graduates
‘at Harvard's Business School, over
a period of many years, has been
particulary notable. Since 1961, men

Attrition Rate

The report takes cognizance of the
high rate of attrition within the
School of Commerce. Professor Gunn
pointed out that the cause of the
rate of attrition appears to be a lack
of motivation which seems related
to a lack of self-confidence. The
celebrated “sophomore slump” which
claims a significant number of those
leaving, or changing majors, is, ac-
cording to Mr. Gunn, “an inevitable
part of ecomplishing what a man
eomes to college for, namely to
conquer feelings of basic insecurity
and the lack of self-confidence.”

It is a reductio ad absurdum of
the kind of scholarship which ster-
ilizes the problems of living men
rather than solving them. Pozzo de-
scribes lyrically the twilight, and
then reveals he was performing, not
expressing himself. Vladimir, in an
articulate echoing of Lucky’s speech,
ponders, in formal oratory, the
need to act when opportunity pre-
sents itself, or be lost; and the
speech itself prevents him from do-
ing what he is talking about.

Finally, the play is fraught with
cliches that are revitalized, usually
ironically, by a new context. Pozzo’s
diminishing evaluation of “this gen-
eration” which ends in the vapid
phrase, “It is true, the population
has increased,” is an example of
this.

In these three respects, then—
Beckett's use of ideas, the stage, and
language—he demands that his au-
dience be widely read, experienced
theater-goers who are alive both to
traditions he is violating and to
certain habitual uses of words.

He also demands that we have
suffered and can laugh at ourselves.

The Troubadour Theater’s current
production of Waiting for Godot
does exciting justice to Beckett's
concerns. Though the performance I
saw was up and down—the second
act was markedly better than the
first—it was always interesting, re-
vealing that Mr. Lee Kahn ean give
consistent and strong direction to

a difficult play. The lighting was ex-

cellent and the set appropriately

austere.

Don Baker's performance (Lucky)
was the most even of the four major
parts. He handled his one oration
(a three page speech with no punc-
tuation) will, and controlled his
gestures and facial expressions in a
wonderfully varied, loose-jointed
way. Jeff Williams, whose timing
seemed a bit off in Act I, came back
strong in Act II and rendered a
poignant and perplexed Estragon.

Jake Duvall said his “Yes sirs”
and “No sirs” with an effective mix-
ture of bewilderment and fear. Lew
Davis (Vladimir and Jim Settle
(Pozzo) seemed to me to suffer
from the same problem, a lack of
voice modulation. Both of them came
on full blast and kept yelling;
though, again, they began in Act II
to vary both pitch and volume ef-
fectively.

In fact, if I have a quibble, it is
with the loudness which many of
the lines were spoken. Godot is a
quiet play which suffers when it is
shouted. Its terror and secarifying
beauty come across much better
when they are at odds with silence.
Vladimir's inaudible but perfectly
mouthed, “that you saw me,” near
the end of the play, was one of the
most moving lines in the perform-
ance.

 

Report

The curriculum in commerce and
business administration is a sound
one. In 1948, Harvard's graduate
School of Business organized its
program around functional fields
common to all businesses. In 1956,
Washington and Lee became one of
the first undergraduate schools in
the nation to adopt such an approach.

The need for an introduction to
the use of the electronic computer
in the management curriculum has
emerged as primarily important. The
curriculum has always been under
continuous review, and no additional
course of high priority has been
identified

The content of accounting courses
remains under frequent review,
keeping pace with changing prac-
tices. A proliferation of courses of-
fered in the department is regard-
ed as “superfluous.”

The report goes on to suggest bet-
ter maintenance and the enlargement
of the school’s library facilities, Spe-
cifieally, the report outlines the
need for a full-time librarian, addi-
tional shelf space, and study areas.

Professor Gunn stressed that no
conclusions as to the Commerce
School's self study have yet been
made, The final report of the Uni-
versity Self-Study Committee will
incorporate any conclusions and
recommendations

Although a significant part of the
jtatistieal data on the Commerce
Sehool has been collected, the most
difficult part of the self-study now

W&L Faces Tough
Washington Gridders

Washington and Lee’s Generals
travel to St. Louis, Missouri Sat-
urday to meet Washington Univer-
sity’s Battling Bears in what head
coach Lee McLaughlin describes as
“the toughest game of the year.” The
contest closes the season for both
teams.

The Bears lost last weekend to Se-
wanee, the College Athletic Confer-
ence champion, but carry a 2-1 CAC
record into the game. The Generals
won their first conference game

against Southwestern of Memphis,
26-13, last and sport a 1-2 mark. In
Washington and Lee’s

season play,

 

The La
The Generals get ready

record stands at 3-5. Thus a W&L
win this weekend would force a
three-way tie for second place among
CAC members, Centre, Washington,
and W&L. Should the Generals lose,
however, Washington would retain
the second place slot outright with
a 3-1 mark while W&L would drop
to fourth place at 1-3. Southwestern
has sewn up last place, posting a
0-4 ledger.

Washington features both an ex-
pert passing attack and a disturb-
ingly consistent running game. Ac-
cording to McLaughlin, the Bears are
“the best balanced team we've faced

I-M aGoGo

 

Charlie Covers NL, CFL, Pool and I-M

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

Last week the baseball writers
of the National League cities voted
Willie Mays the MVP—the Most
Valued Player, not the most Valu-
able, We say this because of only one
thing—the record of Sandy Koufax.

Timeout...Koufax and Maruy
Wills did not collect one vote on
two of the twen-
ty ballots cast, and
each has ten
names on it. Could
these two perhaps
been the ballots of
SF sportswriters?
But then again,
Dodger-Giant re-
lations have never
been too friendly,
right Juan? Time-
Mics

Mays is great,
perhaps the best all-around ball-
player today, but if he didn’t hit it
out of the park, then McCovey did,
or Hart did, or Alou did, or almost
any other Giant regular did. And in
a line-up like the Giants’, there are
a lot of guys who can make the big
play (say, how come they didn’t win
the pennant?)

Bensinger

Koufax, however, is a Dodger, a
member of a team that hit far fewer
homers than did Mays and McCovey
alone. The Dodgers had to be lucky
to hit singles, much less score runs.
Yet Koufax won 26 games (for the
Giants, Reds, Pirates, or Braves he
would have won 30-plus; there can
be little doubt about this), but he
also held the staff together.

Mays hit more homers than any
one else this year. Koufax struck
out more batters than any one else
ever. Willie missed five games. Sandy
didn’t miss a turn. Willie hit for a
fairly high average as usual. Sandy
won the major league ERA crown, as
usual (four years in a row ain’t real
bad.)

Mays. They would have finished two
or three notches lower without him.
The Dodgers finished first with Kou-
fax. They wouldn’t have made the
first division without him. They
might even have challenged the
Mets.

A great player like Mays deserves
recognition, a great one like Koufax
the MVP. After all, doesn’t the
letter “V” stand for “Valuable?”

»}} Enough said?

Now to a more serious and im-
portant subject—IM’s. In the football
playoffs, Kappa Sig won the big
game with Phi Delt 7-7 by virtue of
an edge on first downs. However, it
isn’t over yet as the game was suc-
cessfully protested. It seems that
a ref measured a clipping penalty
from the line of scrimage instead of
from the point of clipping. A forty
yard penalty doesn’t help does it
Birnie? The game will be replayed
today. At any rate Pi Phi was third
and ZBT fourth.

In wrestling, the winners were
Phi Kap, Sigma Chi, SPE, and Phi
Psi. The finals are now under way
and should be completed Monday
night. It is interesting to note, how-
ever, that there are reports of an
eligibility protest (another one?) in
League B. Wasn’t it just last week

rules? We think so,
and the IM Board don’t seem to.

Pocket billiards is gaining popularity
and respectibility rapidly. It is in a
new era of acceptibility and has a
brand new image. If there is room

room for pool.

For those who are really sports-
minded we may plan a campaign for
an annual Grand Prix between Lex-
ington and Amherst. We are sure
that we could find several of “Lex-
ington’s Finest” to act as judges.
Those interested, please contact
David Marchese (2842 minutes) at
463-5056.

Now a question for the intellect-
uals—who was the only man fired
from the world’s greatest sinecure,
the office of Baseball Commissioner?
(If it wasn’t one before the era of

Ford Frick, it certainly is now—
quote: It’s a league matter and
hence out of my hands. We only

hope that General Eckert will steer
the office back to the proper course.)
Yes sir, it’s A. B. “Happy” Chand-
ler, erstwhile and worthless ex-
governor of Kentucky.

“Well, “the Bubbly One” is now
commissioner of the new Continental
Football League, featuring such
teams as the Wheeling (?) Ironmen,
the Hartford Charter Oaks (?), and
the Charleston Rockets.

Basically the CFL has four types
of players: those who play for fun,
those who are past their NFL car-
reers, those who still hope for one,
and the “unemployables.”
