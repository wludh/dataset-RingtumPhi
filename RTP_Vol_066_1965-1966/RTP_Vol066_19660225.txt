‘EC Establishes Precedent

With Mickey Isikoff Case

A sophomore, Mickey Isikoff, has
been placed on social probation un-
til spring vacation by the Executive
Committee because of repeated viola-
tions of conventional dress regula-
tions. In the precedent-setting de-
cision, the vote was 8 for social
probation, 2 against, and 1 abstaining.
President Fred Mindel did not vote
because he was presiding.

The details of the case are as
follows: Isikoff has had an assimila-
tion record since his freshman year.
This year. he was assimilated re-
peatedly and was called before the
Assimilation Committee twice, where
he was warned that a third violation
would refer his case to the EC.

Isikoff was assimilated at 11 dif-
ferent times by 15 different people.
It is asserted that Isikoft was usual-

CPAs Outline
Uniform Pink

Sheet System

Fraternity presidents and treasur-
ers last night heard outlined a pro-
posal made by Lexington Certified
Public Accountants C. L. Harer and
J. H. Shelton, designed to assure
the greatest practical accuracy of
fraternities’ financial statements,
and to “make shenanigans highly
unlikely.”

 

Speaking in introduction, Dean
Atwood noted that he and Inter-
fraternity Council president Chuck
Griffin have been “thinking about
whether financial statements as they
are now submitted are as proper as
should be.” Under the CPA plan
being considered now, accurate re-

ports by treasurers would be vir-
tually assured, whereas under the

present system they can be “fudged.”
Atwood commented that it is his
personal hope that a_ succesful

and uniform system can be estab-
lished
Mr. Harer observed that both ac-

counting firms in town have seen a
major problem in the constant turn-
over of personnel within the frater-
nities; some type of control, he said,
should be instituted to assure that
a set of standards will be followed
and checks made to assure accuracy.
If proper attention is paid to the
books. Harer claimed, then deviations
will be caught in their earlier stages.

The proposals outlined by the ac-

countants, who were described by
Dean Atwood as “friendly competi-
tors,” began with a study to be

made by the CPA's separately or to-
gether, perhaps with the assistance
of a W&L accounting professor, to
establish a recommended standard-

ly wearing wheat jeans, a sweater,
and a loose or untied tie when as-
similated.

Cooperative but Adamant

Assimilation Committee members
stated that Isikoff appeared before
the committee each time he was
summoned and was cooperative, even
though adamant on wearing his ha-
bitual attire.

The Isikoff case is the first sub-
mitted to the EC under the recent
ruling that the Assimilation Com-
mittee cannot levy fines but must
submit third offenders to the EC.
Other cases are pending however.

The case has come under some
comment because it establishes a
precedent and because of the nature
of the punishment administered to
Isikoff. For Isikoff, social probation
means he cannot enter his fraternity
house for four weeks. Isikoff cur-
rently eats and sleeps there.

When interviewed, Isikoff remark-
ed, “I’m certainly not innocent; it is
true that I was out of conventional
dress, but no more so than a sig-
nificant percentage of people on
campus. I did not expect the severi-
ty of the punishment though. If I
had known how severe it might be,
I would have worn more accept-
able clothing—I had no intention of
making myself a martyr.”

Committeemen Interviewed

In connection with Isikoff’s case,
a number of people on the execu-
tive and assimilation committees
were interviewed. Vice-president
Dave Marchese, representing the
majority opinion of the EC comment-
ed: “The Assimilation Committee
acted under its instructions to send
third violators to the EC. We feel
that after Isikoff had made so many
violations of conventional dress, and
in light of his past record, we had
to serve him with some punishment
We felt that Isikoff was trying to
cause trouble. He has been a chronic
violator since he was a freshman.
and he has never even tried to fol-

Traditional Dress

“Ponder your right to destroy and maim that which
many others before you sustained with pride and dig-
nity. Decide if you wish to share in a unity of spirit
with other Washington and Lee men of many genera-
tions, decide if you are going to hold in contempt or in
apathetic indifference this bond of fellowship. Weight
carefully your obligation to give something of yourself
to this University, as well as your privilege to take a
part of it with you.”

Is it too much trouble to put on a coat and tie in the morn-
ing? Is conventional dress still worth the trouble of maintaining
it? The student body will soon have a clear chance to resolve
these questions in the forthcoming referendum on the Assimi-
lation committee, for the EC has stated its intention to use
the students’ decision as a guideline. Should we keep the com-
mittee or not?

Obviously, the issue hinges on whether conventional dress
has a significant value today, and it is our opinion that it cer-
tainly does. Washington and Lee is one of the few remaining
universities of national prominence which still values the aristo-
cratic principles of honor, casual civility to one’s colleagues, and
gentlemanly deportment and dress. If we allow ourselves to
descend into the mass of common non-conformism that char-
acterizes so much of American education we will be destroy-
ing the heritage of a century, robbing ourselves of a tremendous
asset, and denying our successors a set of values that manifestly
deserves to be perpetuated.

As students here, we are often in a position of being un-
able to see the forest for the trees. On a day-to-day basis, con-
ventional dress simply means taking the trouble to dress as
adults. To W&L graduates, however, the continued existence
here of traditions like conventional dress serves to distinguish
W&L men from graduates of hundreds of nearly similiar
schools. The W&L alumnus is almost unique today in having
been educated as a gentleman.

There are not many students here who blatantly violate
the spirit of conventional dress, but they exert a destructive
influence far out of proportion to their numbers. The regrett-
able fact behind the impotence of the Assimilation Committee
and its current disrepute among the students is that a vocifer-
ous minority is snowballing the passive majority into abandon-
ing concepts that are of great value.

This minority is attacking the rights of the rest of us in
attempting to destroy traditions that have always been sources
of pride and molders of character in the W&L man. If these
people were simply stressing the importance of individuality,
they could be ignored or even supported—but they are not.
They are undermining W&L’s greatest asset and distinction,
and they are hurting us all. The students who dress sloppily are
degrading an institution which does credit to each individual
W&L student.

Our distinctive position as W&L men will exist only so long
as W&L remains a distinctive university. For our own good
and for the preservation of an outstanding heritage, we, the
majority, must at last begin to move against the destruction
of our traditions and those few who are destroying them.

At present, there are at least three ways of individual ac-
tion: become part of an active consensus of disapproval to-
ward those who flaunt the W&L tradition; support your stu-
dent government by assimilating offenders; and vote to
strengthen the Assimilation Committee in the forthcoming
election. If the currently passive opinions of the majority can
be mobilized, then we can still save the rich tradition of W&L
before it is irrevocably lost.

Characteristic Gesture

The presentation of the Noell-Eckes Trophy, honoring
the University’s top debater, characterizes Dean Frank Gil-
liam’s 39 years of devotion, and dedicated service to Wash-
ington and Lee.

During his many active years, Gilliam has served as teacher,
administrator, and trusted friend to thousands of students. He
remains today a faithful friend of the University and its student
body.

In honoring two of our finest debaters, Dean Gilliam
is displaying once again the deep affection which he holds
every student. it is a characteric gesture; a magnificent ges-
ture.

By JEFF WAINSCOTT

The issues surrounding the strug-
gle to prevent the affiliation of Wash-
ington and Lee with the National
Student Association are numerous
and can quite easily become emo-
tional. It is to be hoped that a ra-
tional discussion of both sides will
prevail. I would like to briefly state
two of the major arguments against
affiliation, first that the so-called
services provided by NSA are not at
all what they seem, and second, that
NSA consistently takes unrepresen-
tative political stands.

One of the most appealing argu-
ments made on behalf of NSA is that
they can help bring W&L out of its
isolationism with all the useful ser-
vices they provide. It sounds nice,
but the facts behind these glittering
promises are somewhat less than
glittering. Fred Mindel has repeated-
ly stressed the low cost and wide
variety of these services. One fre-
quently mentioned cost is $15.

In a letter from one of the leaders
of the successful fight against NSA
at Hollins, we are told that Hollins
was paying some $600 per year and
receiving virtually no services. At
Lawrence College in Wisconsin, $750
was paid to NSA for benefits which,
acording to student leaders at Law-
ence, could have been obtained else-
where for only $52.50. The other
$700 went for conferences which
even the NSA campus coordinator
has admitted were of no value to
Lawrence.

The University of Miami also
spent $600, and the NSA dues of
Dartmouth amounted to some $84.
Strong evidence is going to have
to be presented to prove that NSA
will actually deliver what it prom-
ises. There is a great abundance of
evidence to the contrary.

Now, the political side of NSA
should be discussed. The National
Student Association is composed of
student governments representing
some 350 or so schools, a very small
proportion of all the American col-
leges and universities. NSA deals
only with a handful of student lead-
ers and not with the student bodies.
Consequently, a good many of the
students which NSA claims to repre-
sent have never even heard of the
organization. Yet, NSA has stated
that it represents “a student point
of view which is the most represen-
tative that can be obtained by the
democratic process.”

What is this point of view? Each
summer NSA holds a national con-
vention at which they pass resolu-
tions on behalf of student opinion.
Admittedly, the political resolutions
make up only a small part of all
those passed, yet they are so con-
trary to what I believe is American
student opinion, that I do not un-
derstand how NSA can legitimately
make them.

As some may recall, some of these
positions were outlined in an earlier
letter to the R-t P. At the last con-
vention they ranged from calling
for the admission of Red China to
the UN, to recommending cessation
of the bombing of North Viet Nam
and “unconditional talks to include
separate National Liberation Front
participation.” They also suggested
the substitution of a new national
police force for the FBI in matters
of “racial violence and brutality.”
These positions would hardly seem
to be those of the majority of Amer-
ican students.

Why was NSA able to pass such
resolutions? One reason might be
that often not even a majority of the
member schools send delegates to
the conventions, as in 1963 only 45
pereent participated. Also in 1963,
only 35 per cent of the resolutions
passed were passed by the conven-
tion. The remainder were handled
by the thirty-one member execu-
tive committee. NSA has very flimsy
grounds for claiming representation
of student opinion.

It might be mentioned that NSA
offers the rather dubious scape-goat
of minority reports for those who op-
pose the resolutions passed. These
minority reports, if anyone takes the
time to prepare them, rarely receive
the attention of a resolution passed
by NSA in convention or in execu-
live committee,

One further point should be made
clear. For my part, I oppose NSA
taking political stands, not because
I disagree with those stands, but
because they are clearly not rep-
resentative and NSA claims they are.
In conclusion, I would suggest that
NSA as presently constituted, has no
right to represent any political po-
sition, liberal, conservative or what-
ever, as that of the majority of
American students, and that the ser-
vices are not what they sem. It is
for these reasons that I and many

 

others are opposing NSA at W&L.

NSA And Washington And Lee

By RICHARD NASH
Sophomore Executive Committeeman

It would be a pretty safe bet to
wager that ninety percent of Wash-
ington and Lee’s student body has
no idea what the letters NSA rep-
resent. And it would probably be an
equally safe bet to venture that
most of them don’t even care to
know.

So why all the uproar over the
thing? The uproar is because some
students do care, and more ought to.
The United States National Student
Association is an organization whose
membership Washington and Lee’s
Executive Committee is considering
joining. But the question has arisen
as to whether or not the advantages
of NSA outweigh its disadvantages.

Supporters of membership point
out some very desirable advantages.
The Executive Committee, this year,
is undertaking a full schedule of
studies and reforms. These studies
could be greatly aided with the help
of NSA. For example, let us assume
that the E.C, is incestigating a
change in W&L’s inadequate grading
system. As it stands now, we must

 

has moved progressively toward be-
ing a pressure group for Congres-
sional legislation.

Each summer, NSA holds a con-
vention to which all member schools
send delegates. These delegates dis-
cuss and take stands on world prob-
lems. It is believed that the results
of these stands are preplanned and
rigged by a small number of polit-
ically-influenced leaders. In the last
several years, these conventions have
tended to take ultra-liberal stands
which are definitely not in keeping
with the majority opinion of W&L
students. Among other things they
have favored admission of Red
China to the UN, immediate cessa-
tion of bombing in North Vietnam,
unilateral disarmament, and an at-
tack on the American college fra-
ternity system.

Many students sincerely do not
want W&L to go on record as sup-
porting such issues. So opposed are
they to it, that they have raised
money to bring a speaker here to
address the ODK Forum.

Evidence as to NSA’s decreasing
popularity stands in the fact that

 

By APGAR

 

write any number of separate letters|33 colleges and universities have

to various colleges and universities
in the hope that they will return
information to us concerning how
their grading system works. These
letters take much time to write, and
replies are slow in coming if they
come at all.

If, however, we belong to NGA,
we could write to NSA's permanent
staff and we would receive extensive
information on as many colleges’
grading systems as we asked for.
And, we would receive it within
a week,

li W&L were a member of the
NSA, then all W&L students would
be eligible to buy at a small cost.
a national-international student
identification card and receive dis-
counts of 5 per cent to 25 per cent
or more on services, goods, and
amusements throughout the nation
and world.

Unfortunately space limitations do
not permit any more advantages to
be listed here. But abundant litera-
ture and information concerning
NSA’s advantages may be obtained
from either myself (463-6909) or
Fred Mindel (463-2484).

Meanwhile, on the other side, we
find students who are violently op-
posed to W&L's membership in NSA.
They are not without legitimate
reason either. Their main objec-

 

tion is that the NSA, since its origin,

 

dropped their membership since
1961 and 14 more have rejected pro-
posed NSA affiliation. One of these
rejections came from Washington
and Lee when our membership in
the organization was earlier pro-

The Young Americans for Freedom
feel so strongly against NSA, that
they have waged all out war against
the organization. They contend that
“NSA represents the Liberal-leftist
line to be the true opinion of all
American students.”

Again, because of space, all the
evidence against NSA cannot be pre-
sented. More information may be
obtained from myself or from Jeff
Wainscott (463-6905),

The choice seems to be a simple
one. Are the numerous advantages
that can be received worth being
faslely represented on liberal policies
or not’ I would like to encourage all
students to read about NSA in the
Ring-tum Phi, listen to the speakers
at the ODK Forum, and contact Fred
Mindel and Jeff Wainscott for addi-
tional information, It is only in this
way that you can reach an intelli-
gent decision,

Campus Critics Challenge & Support
Joining National Student Association

Pro

By JOYCE RIDDLE

President SGH
Hollins College
NSA has one purpose: to see that
the American student is given every
educational advantage. NSA provides
us with the third dimension in edu-
cation—a nationally respected for-
um for expression, and the financial
means for action. At the national
conference delegates gather to cri-
ticize student activity in the US.
Opinions expressed range from Stu-
dent Government, to social activity
in the community, to national and
international affairs.

Student comment on Student Gov-
ernment is readily accepted. There is,
however, great debate as to whether
or not students should actively ex-
press, especially on a national and
international level, political views.
It is the political aspects of NSA
that I would wish to defend. A
common criticism is that students
are too inexperienced to have sig-
nificant political opinions. Yet we
vote, our income taxes support Medi-
care and the Poverty Program, and
we fight in Viet Nam. Though our
age, if nothing else, puts us at a
disadvantage, the fact that we are
forced to support government pro-
jects with our money and our time
should inspire us to overcome any
disadvantage and inform ourselves.

Let’s asume that you, the read-
er and I, the writer, are in accord
thus far. How, you ask me, does
NSA fit in? For one thing, the po-
litical opinions expressed by NSA
might not be identical to those of
W&L. W&L should thus not concern
itself with NSA. My answer is that,
first of all, the opinion of NSA de-
pends completely on the opinion of
its members. These opinions take the
form of resolutions and mandates
passed at the congress. These reso-
lutions do not represent ‘spur of
the moment’ decisions, but must be
passed in essentially the same form,
at two consecutive congresses before
becoming basic policy declarations.

Secondly, and most important,
W&L’s membership in NSA in no
way means that you support every
policy and opinion arrived at dur-
ing the congres. On the contrary,
whenever a minimum of 20 per cent
of delegates dissent, a minority re-
port is published next to the reso-
lution, and W&L’s name would be
listed in print as a member of the
opposition,

But you might further contend,
NSA is controlled by liberals and
the conservative moderate voice of
W&L could never be heard. It is
true that at the 65 congress, the lib-
eral caucus outnumbered that of the
conservatives two to one. But I
would remind you that the uncom-
mitted delegates outnumbered both
these groups four to one. The vote
of the uncommitted delegates decided
the issues, and these delegates were
swayed by the force of the argu-
ments presented on the floor. I would
also point out that the single most
influential speaker at the congress
was the delegate from Agnes Scott, a
small women's college in Georgia.
Surely W&L could produce an
equally forceful representative,
thereby insuring that your political
convictions will not only be heard,
but will be carried. If you presently
express a political opinion at W&L,
your voice carries no further than
the Lexington city limits. Opinions
expressed at the NSA congress are
heard nationally and internationally
through such publications as The
New York Times, The Student, and
Time Magazine, They are often pre-
sented to Congressional sub-commit-
tees by NSA national officers,

NSA is the oldest and most rep-
resentative organization of its kind
in the U.S. By its history of achieve-
ments it has attained international
respect. Thus, like it or not, it is
considered the prime voice of Amer-
ican student opinion. In the words of
John F. Kennedy: “The NSA can

review its history with pride... It
has provided the American student
community with a forum for ex-
pressing student opinion on vital
iasues of the day. Its national con-
Kresses are invaluable experiences
in the workings of democratic legis-
lative processes...” Eisenhower said
that “at a time when understanding

among people of the world is so im-
portant to our future, | am partie-

ularly glad to hear of the increased
emphasis being given to international
affairs in NSA.”

NSA does not claim to represent
the opinion of all American students
It represents only a relatively amall
group Of act ve and progressive ones
NSA action “is indicative of a major,
and long overdue, change in the

tatus of at least a sewment of Ami-

Generals Win, 72-70
In First C A C Game

Employing the services of Virginia
Telephone and Telegraph to track
down the results, the Ring-tum Phi
has learned that the Generals of
Washington and Lee have won their
first game in the Collegiate Athletic
Conference basketball tournament,
72-70 over Southwestern.

The Generals opened fast, racing
ahead 21-6 before the Lynx began to
hit. At halftime the gap had been
narrowed to five, 40-35,

After the break Southwestern be-
gan a full court press defense, driv-
ing the Generals into numerous floor
errors. With Washington and Lee
turning over the ball, Southwestern
continued to gain, and within 24 sec-

Only Trivia Contest Entries
Despite Champagne Offer

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Mannered Reporter

Entries for the First Annual W&L
Trivia Championships have been dis-
appointingly few so far. according to
John Beresford Tipton, the chair-
man of the group which is sponsor-
ing the event.

“So far we have received entries
from only two fraternities and the
Independent Union,” Tipton says. “I
am surprised that so few of our
school’s trivia experts want to com-

pete for the bottle of champagne |)

we are offering as a prize.”

It has been decided to make the
event a competition among four two-
man teams. Should more than four
teams be entered, a_ preliminary

written exam will be given to pick ||

the finalists, who will compete over
WREL sometime in the middle of
March.

Entries accepted so far include
Bob Knowles and Claude Rodgers,
for Phi Gam; Dave Mathewson and
Randy Poore, for Kappa Sig; and Len
Mickle and Benard Person, for the
Independents.

Tipton urged athletic directors to
select their entries at the earliest
possible date. “A great deal of prac-
tice will be necessary if the teams
are to learn to work together
smoothly,” he said. Entries should be
mailed to Special Assistant Tom
White at Box 457.

Generals To Play Varsity
Tomorrow Despite Snow;
Sackett, David To Return

Owing to the quick melting of
yesterday's snow the annual Alum-
ni-Varsity ski meet will not be held
tomorrow. A football game will be
played instead

Head Coach Lee McLaughlin will
take the 1966 Generals into what he
says will be “not too much like a
game, but we'll try.” The team held
a scrimmage yesterday at the height
of the storm, and Coach Mac says
“We got some good hitting in.”

The alumni squad, coached by as-
sistant Bob Payne will include re-
turnees Bill David, Henry Sackett,
Charlie Gummey, Terry Fohs, and
Dan Manson. “I understand Coach
Leslie may get in for oneplay,” says

Coach Mac. “If he does, we'll run
right at him, of course.”
Most of this year’s seniors will al-

so play for the alumni, with the two
large exceptions of Billy Andrew
and John Anthony

This is an impressive lineup, head-
ed by Fohs, a graduate of the class
of 1962 and a Litle All-America line-
backer despite his 145 pounds. Sac-
kett and Gummey, both outstanding

runners, will give

a backfield led by senior Larry
Craig

The alums will also be strong in
the passing department with Craig
throwing to fellow seniors Tersh

Baker and Bob Barclay and to All-
State flanker Bill David

The varsity will probably start
Andy Bloom at the helm with a
fine deep young backfic ld provid-
ing the offensive punch. The big
question mark in the General offense
will be the line, almos all of whom
tarters trom iast yeat will be play
ing for the alumni tomorrow

Tilden, the game’s top scorer with

game for the first time. 70-70.

But the Generals didn’t fold, as
with three seconds left senior Steve
Sweitzer passed to fellow senior Bob
Spessard, who hit a sweeping hook
from the top of the key to advance
the Generals to the second round to-
night opposite Sewanee.

Sweitzer led the team in a well
balanced scoring attack with 14
points, as Rob Bauer followed with
12 and Spessard 10. Jody Kline and
Earl Edwards just missed double
figures.

The Generals hit 37 per cent to
the Lynx’s 33 and beat them on
the boards where they have been
strong all year 55-38.

opponent in the final will be the

Mardi Gras Survivor Writes Memoirs

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

“No trouble, just calling to clue
you in where I am. Uh, it seems that
I'm in New Or-
leans.”

“Yeah, Louisi-
ana!”

“Yeah, I realize
that school is still
in Virginia.”

“Well, after all,
it’s Mardi Gras.
Uh-huh, I know.”

“Well, look at it

this way....”
+

Bensinger

The above is the
intro to an amazing phone call,
amazing because I stayed out of
trouble (1 think, I haven't spoken to
my father yet).

New Orleans at Mardi Gras time
is the only town in the world where
you can have more drunks than in-
habitants. Take the total population,
add twenty thousand, deduct one
(the police chief) and that’s the
number of those who will swear
when its all over that somebody
must have driven a Mack truck over
their heads.

Bourbon Street isn’t the only spot
either. The reason is very simple—
you just can't squeeze more than ten
thousand men, women, and queers
there at one time, no matter how
hard you try.

The whole town erupts in a blaze
of partying. The parade routes, the
rest of downtown, the suburbs all
make the wildest affair even at our
hallowed institution seem like Cadet
parties in the Guardhouse. To single
out any one place would be unfair,

but... back to the Quarter.

There’s the Downtown Motel, right |

on Bourbon, with each room open-
ing onto a balcony. One lady, or
perhaps woman to make a distinc-
tion, ducked into her room and
came back with a pair of panties
which ‘she threw to the mob be-
low. When the fight for the prize
was over, a right fair looking (trans-
lation—real tough) babe decided not

to be outdone. On another balcony, '

with the aid of her escort, she took
off and threw down her stockings,
garters, and panties. Heard in the
crowd: Hey, lady, you ain’t got no
panties on.

Then there was the 62”, 240-
pounder who was wearing leotards
so tight that you could easily see
that his posterior was broken.

(Don’t think that it isn’t tough try-
ing to say things without really say-
ing them).

Or the girls, some very good look-
ing, who weren't really girls. There
were a few guys who got a few
surprises.

Let’s not forget what seemed to
be half the navy was also there to
party. It seamed the other half was
the Shore Patrol sent to look after
them.

And how about Hell's Angels. The
closest that one actually got was the
Mississippi River Bridge (probably

ithe Huey P. Long Bridge—every-
thing else down there is named af-
ter Him). The news reports were
very fair. One said that a trio of
Angels picked up was unarmed, ex-
cept for three switchblades,,
jack handle, and a set of tire chains.

The General swimmers, sporting

a fine 8-3 dual meet record, will
face Sewanee and Washington at

will not count toward the overall

schools entered, trophies and
medals will be awarded to the win-

W&L coach Norris Eastman, who
is in charge of the event, predicts a
very close meet, “All three teams
are about equal in quality,” he said,
“but Sewanee seems to have enough
superiority in depth to rate a slight
edge on paper, while Washington

to go over .500 for the season, as
they carry a 4-4 record into the
meet.

Coach Dick Miller, however is not
optimistic. “They’re stronger than
they were last year when we tied
them 12-12,” he said, “and you
would have to say we are weaker.
There are three or four real close
matches, so it can be fairly close or
it could be a runaway for them.”

Three seniors will be wrestling for
the last time for W&L. They are
Jim Bruton at 130, and co-captains
Kemble White and Jamie Andrew at
137 and 160 respectively. Bruton will
face Frank McCall, who defeated
him last year in a JV match, while
White wrestles Bob Rhodes, beaten
by Dick Musick of W&L last year.
Andrew's opponent will be Herb
Soles.

Other matches in the meet will
probably pit Rolly Jacobs at 123
against undefeated John Shurberg
and Bobby Payne at 145 against
Rod Wilson. Don Patterson will face
Pat McCarthy, who lost to Tom
Stover last year, in the 152-pound
class.

Cary Stewart, brother of W&L
heavyweight Warren Stewart and
winner over Andrew last year, will
wrestle at either 167 or 177. At the
former weight, he would face Bob-
by Munson, (who would give away
about five pounds), while at 177 his
opponent would be Jay Clarke.

Walter Childes will fill the other
spot for the Cavaliers. The heavy-
weight match will pit Warren Stew-
art against Bob Shimmer, a 5-0 win-
ner over Bruce McPhee in last year’s
freshman meet.

Cold Check Committee Reports

(Continued from Page 1)

He added that the committee has
not generally imposed heavy fines,
in the belief that it is more import-
ant to have the check made good
than for the committee to make
money. He stated his own opposition
to an increase in fines.

Fleischer also explained that the
sharp rise in the number of bad
checks appearing since the middle of
December—three-fourth of the to--
tal—was a normal trend, due to the
fact that merchants will often hold
bad checks until the end of a se-
mester before bringing them before
the committee, that many students
run unexpectedly low on money to-
ward the semester’s end, and that
the committee itself is unable to
meet during the examination weeks.

The EC unanimously voted a $3
fine for any student who, before
appearing before the Cold Check

Committee, had been contacted by
the merchant involved but had still
not made good the check. The fine
would be in addition to the regular
fines imposed by the committee.

The EC also voted to recommend
the possibility of making signs which
could be placed on merchants’ reg-
isters and which would remind stu-
dents of their responsibilities in
writing a check. It also suggested
more frequent calls by members of
the committee on certain stores and
resturants which have complained
recently of the numbers of bad
checks which they are receiving.

President Fred Mindel announced
also that the ODK Forum on the
National Student Association will
take place at 7:30 p.m. on Wednes-
day, March 2. The place has not
yet been set. The student poll on
the question has been scheduled for
Friday, March 4.

 

 

Pink Sheet Changes Proposed

system—in order that all houses will
use the same terminology for expen-
ditures and receipts, etc. Each fra-
ternity should have an annual audit.
“Every effort should be made to
have qualified boys act as treasur-
ers,” not necessarily “popular” or
“needy” students, although it will
be a problem to find eighteen quali-
fied to do the job. Each fraternity
would send new elected treasurers
to the house’s CPA for instruction;
books of the houses would be check-
ed at least every third month, and
more often—even monthly—if the
accountant should feel it necessary.
Others in each house should con-
cern themselves with funds: vouchers
and checks should necessarily be
countersigned by another officer, and
proof of expenditures should be
maintained. This practice is not now
followed, Mr. Harer commented, es-
pecially with social funds,

The proposed CPA plan, Harer
continued, would possibly cost more
than audits, for those fraternities
which even bother with audits; but
records will be kept more accurate-
ly and efficently if the job is done
regularly and thoroughly—and there
is less chance of “trouble.” The ac-
countants would not necessarily
audit the books completely each time
they are reviewed, but audits would
be performed on accasion without
warning.

Some houses, he said, keep books
so incomplete that they cannot be
audited at all—in some cases, only
a “guess” can be made as to what
“might have been done with money.”
Any accountants can guarantee the
accuracy of a set of books only when
they are complete with correct re-
ceipts and vouchers.

A rather heated question-and-
answer session followed, with at
least one fraternity which has an
audit of sorts each month by its
National that the accountants stated
is more like a bookkeeping check and
others whose books “are in good
order now” see no advantage to
spending the aproximate expense

Points brought out in response to
and in comment on questions includ-
ed Dean Atwood’s observations that
“literally half the treasurers on cam-
pus cannot state their present actual
financial positions” and that some
pink sheets are turned in with mis-
takes made on them and yet they
balance. Griffin stated that the pur-
pose of the IFC’s investigation of
the proposal is “to keep the (school)
administration from taking action on
its own.” (Dean Atwood’s reply:
“HE said it, not me.”) Atwod re-
fused to commit himself as to wheth-
er the administration would take

tion for a constitutional amendment

es, to require all fraternities to

low the tradition. We realize that
there are other chronic offenders
and regret that the student body has
not taken action on them. Our po-
sition is that we are simply carry-
ing out our job and are not trying to
make an example of Isikoff.

“But if the Isikoff case is to be
considered an example because of
| the precedent we established, then
we would hope the rest of the stu-

 

| dent body will be encouraged to ac-

cept their responsibilty and assimi-
late other such chronic violators.
Granted the BHC realizes that the
student body does not wear con-
ventional dress 100 per cent of the
time, but it is the chronic violator
whose ‘unconventional’ attire is det-
rimental to both the spirit and code
of conventional dress.”

Marchese reported that some of
the Executive Committee members
felt that Isikoff’s punishment was
lenient. In the past, he said, such
blatant violators have come under
suspension from the University.

President Mindel, speaking for the
minority opinion, stated: “Although
my personal opinion differs radically
with the majority opinion of the EC
which resulted in the action taken
regarding Isikoff, I stand one hun-
dred per cent behind this decision
and the BC's right to make it.

“Every member of the EC whole-
heartedly supports the idea of con-
ventional dress and the action taken
against Isikoff was to a large degree,
I believe, an expression of that sen-
timent. It must be remembered that
these men are in office only because
the student body displayed confi-
dence in their integrity and judg-
ment. The fact cannot be denied
that in this matter every member
honestly and sincerely voted how he
thought best, and for this reason I

stand behind and respect their votes,
even while in disagreement.

“I do not stand alone in my com-
plete antipathy, not to the idea of
conventional dress, but to any arbi-
trary and universal enforcement of
it. To those of you who disagree not
only with this specific act of en-
foreement—but also with any means
of compulsary enforcement—I urge
you to express this opinion in the
upcoming poll. For the first time in
many years the abolition of conven-
tional dress is not merely a vague
possibility, but rather a distinct
probability.”

Assimilation Comimttee Chairman
Sam Frazier commented on his com-
mittee’s role in the Isikoff case. “I

feel that there are two things wrong
with the Assimilation Committee,”
said Frazier. “First, if conventional
dress is going to be enforced, there
should be some gradation in penali-
ties. It seems unfair to just talk to
a student at his first offenses, and
then hit him with a drastic punish-
ment. We consider this incident re-
grettable, as we feel sure the IFC
must—regrettable in the sense that
such a severe penalty was necessary.
We feel that this unfortunate sit-
uation could have been avoided if
the Assimilation Committee had had
a discretionary fining power, like the
Student Control Committee, and in
using that power, had dealt with this
violator in a less severe way before
the present situation was reached.

no books on achieving scholarship.
“The great problem is MOTIVA-
TION.”

He said the problem of scholar-
ship is rooted within the structure of
each house. “The chapter house must
become a home, instead of a club-
house.”

He felt this was the point most
W&L fraternities neglected. He noted
the local sysiem was not growing
toward these objectives and “when
you're not growing, you’re dying.”

Ask where he felt fraternities
must start in redefining objectives,
Fletcher said “a clear cut course of
action must be formulated and fol-
lowed by the fraternities.”

“You could start by holding a re-
treat,” explained Fletcher. He de-
