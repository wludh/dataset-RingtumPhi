SW MSFC’s
Present Funds
To University

By DON OTARE

The Student War Memorial Schol-
arship Fund Committee made _ its
annual contribution to the university
yesterday in the form of a check for
$1500, Bernie Harper and Wes Hor-
ner, President and Treasurer of
SWMSFC, presented the check to
Farl S. Mattingly, Treasurer of the
university. It represents the organ-
zation’s money-making efforts of the
1064-65 school year.

SWMSFC was started after World
War II to honor the W&L students
who had given their lives in the
war. The organizations has since
provided the funds for two $400
scholarships yearly. Last year
SWMSFC conducted such projects as
the annual homecomings _ raffle,
‘chool ring sales, and Coke sales
at the university concerts and
dances. They also took charge of
the graduation invitations and caps
and gowns.

This vear, under
of Harper, Horner,
kinsky. the secretary, and Dr. Phil-
lips, the faculty sponsor, SWMSFC
will continue its lucrative endeavors

the leadership

and Gary Bo-

of last year and attempt to find
new and better ideas for raising
funds.

Applications are now being taken,
through Harper and Bokinsky, for
new members from either the soph-
omore or junior class. Ideas for
fund-raising projects will be consid-
ered in the selection of applicants
for membership. The committee will
hold its next meeting on Monday
night at 7:45 p.m., at which time

 

applications will be discussed.

Debaters Hold Meeting;
Ist Tournament Thursday

By FRANK FAIRCHILD, JR.

On Monday, September 20, eighty-
eight students, a record number, re-
ported to Payne Hall for the year’s
first meeting of the debate team. In
outlining plans for the prospective
year, Prof. William W. Chaffin, di-
rector of forensics, commented that
this season promises to be an im-
provement over last year’s highly
successful campaign. He discussed
two practice tournaments which are
to be held here at W&L and listed
upeoming trips for the fall.

Initially, Mr. Chaffin announced
that on Thursday, September 30, a
tournament is slated for experienced
novice debators. In addition, on
Monday, October 4, a novice tourna-
ment is scheduled which will afford

N lee Teouhedous Director Plans

A Diverse Selection Of Plays

A major play from the Theater of
the Absurd, one of Shakespeare's
finest histories, and a slapstick farce
from the Italian Renaissance will be
the offering presented by the Troub-
abours, W&L’s student group, dur-
ing their 1965-66 season.

This schedule, one of the most
varied ever planned by the Troubs,
was announced by newly appointed
director Lee Kahn at the group’s first

meeting of the school year, held
September 19.
The first production, set for No-

vember 17-20, will be Samuel Beck-
ett's Waiting for Godot. Beckett, an
Irishman who lives and works in
France, was one of the pioneers of
the Absurdist school of playwrights,
and Waiting for Godot is his most
popular and most important work
Unlike most plays of this group, it
is distinguished by its humor and by
its real concern for the interest in
humanity.

The Shakespeare play to be pre-
sented is Richard Hl, the story of an
attractive but weak willed king
whose ineffectiveness makes him an
victim to a plot against his
throne. The work has been a [avorite
ever since it was first written, both
with scholars and critics and with

In the addition to describing the
schedule, Kahn also announced
plans for refurbishing and painting
the auditorium of the theater, and
for installing a revolving stage. This
will make possible changes of sets
and theatrical effects which physical
limitations have made difficult until
now. The stage is to be installed in
time for use in Richard I.

By PHIL CLAXTON

in the early spring of 1964 a sug-
gestion was made in a regular meet-
: of the Interfraternity
that that body should look into the
possibilities of an intercollegiate con-
ference similar to those held on
other campuses. The suggestion met
with general approval, and Blaine
Brownell was appointed chairman of
project which at that time was
little more than an idea.

in

a

Brownell set up a committee to
consider the program. A name—
CONTACT~—was given to the infant
conference. A theme—The American
Experience—was chosen. And mid-
March was designated as the period
in which CONTACT would be held.

Object of CONTACT

The object of CONTACT was two-
fold. It was established to fill a void
in intellectual life of Washington and
Lee. And it was established in the
hope that such a program would be
of interest to students and stimulate
them into further intellectual pur-
suits.

CONTACT for 1965 was fairly suc-
cessful in achieving its aims. Former
Secretary of State Dean Acheson was
one of the national advisors for the
program. He suggested that the
theme of CONTACT, “The American
Expierence” be broken into three
parts. The domestic scene, the for-
eign scene, and the tying of the two
together were to be covered. This
general outline was followed.

Unfortunately, CONTACT 65 put
too much emphasis on the political
aspects of the “American Experi-
ence.” While the program met its
primary objective, that of bringing
provocative speakers to the campus,
it failed to arouse the interest of the
students. The reason for this failure
was a simple one: CONTACT 65 had
stressed political topics rather than
offering a broad program that would
have been of interest to a majority
of W&L students.

Set for February

CONTACT for 1966 will attempt
to correct the mistakes made in
1965. CONTACT is scheduled for

 

 

photography operations and the |
quality of. the University publica- |

February 11, 12, and 13. This week-
end was chosen in the hope that stu-
dents would be relatively free of
class assignments.

It is hoped that this year’s program
will be more diversified than last
Spring's. Speakers from four or five
separate courses of study will be

Powell Sande Ariel
For Upcoming Year;
Seeks Contributors

The editor and staff of Ariel have
announce plans for the fourth year
of publication of the W&L student
literary magazine,

Editor Grayson Powell, in an or-
ganizational meeting last Wednesday
night, outlined the publication sched-
ule for the autumn issue and set a
deadline of November 8 for submis-
sion of manuscripts for this issue.
The tentative publication date is No-
vember 22, Powell said.

Manuscripts may be submitted at
any time to the editor or to any
member of the staff, or they may be
left in Ariel’s mailbox in the Stu-
dent Union Building.

Powell also announced the follow-
ing policies governing the selection
of manuscripts: “The single most
important criterion in our selection
of material is that it be well written.
It may be on any subject, but it
must conform to generally accepted
principles of literary taste and judg-
ment and must show some degree of
originality and skill.” Any student
at Washington and Lee may submit
manuscripts to Ariel.

Powell specified four types of ma-
terial that are especially preferred:
fiction, in the form of short stories;
poetry; drama and criticism, in the
form of essays and book reviews. “In
case of doubt about a manuscript’s
eligibility for consideration, the au-
thor should contact me before he
submits his work,” advised the edi-
tor.

He further requested that manu-
scripts be typewritten, doublespaced,
and written on only one side of
standard size plain white paper
Authors should submit each manu-
script separately, under an appro-
priate title. “The author's name
should net appear on the manuscript
itself,” Powell said, “because manu-
scripts are judged without regard
to the author's identity
Instead, he should

each manuscript, bearing
the title of his work,

New Election Process Adopted
By E.C. For Freshmen Balloting

Lee’s Proposal
Adopted Last Night
During EG Meeting

In the weekly meeting of
the Executive Committee last
night plans were formulated
for the freshmen elections to

be held the third week of Oc-

tober.

The new election procedure
adopted was presented by Bob Lee,
senior EC representative, in order
to establish a more efficient and
equitable process. Adoption of the
plan by the EC was unanimous.
In essence the plan breaks down
into three major parts. First, any
person wishing to run for either
class office or EC representative
must file a petition of fifty names

with the Executive Committee before
7 p.m., Monday, October 11.

A primary election will be held
for any contest in which there are
three or more candidates. The two
candidates with the most votes
will then run in the general elec-

tion. The primary will be held
Wednesday, October 13, in’ the
Commons from 12 to 7 p.m.

The general election with the two

top candidates running for each of-
fice will be held Monday, Octobe
18 from 12 to 7 p.m. in the Commons.

Petitions can be filed with the E.C
and campaigns begun before Mon-
day, October 11. However, petitions
cannot be filed after October 11.

The freshmen will elect a
president and vice-president in
addition to one representative to the
Executive Committee. This year
freshmen class officers have been
instituted with the idea of giving
their a more significant role
in the conduct of student govern-
ment.

The Executive Committee also
passed a motion which eliminated
all class officers with the excep-
tion of the president, vice-presi-
dent, and E. C. representative, and
three vice presidents in the senior
class.

This modification of
ficer structure

there is a very real possibility that
the E.C. will strengthen the posi-
tion of the class officers by increas-
ing their responsibility in student
government

In other business the E.C. made
plans to interview each of the com-
mittee chairmen in regard to thei:
policies for the coming year. To fa-
cilitate the effectiveness of the com-
mittees a composite of each com-
mittee to include purpose, scope
and membership will be distributed
to members of the freshmen class

Delayed Rush

At the risk of being labelled a ‘Tuesday morning quarter-

 

back” the Tuesday Edition suggests that it is time for a long| ™

and careful appraisal of the fraternity rush system. For the
past four years the percentage of freshmen who do not affiliate
with a fraternity during rush week has steadily increased. The
falling pledge rate is a reality despite a completely revised rush
program which has in effect given the freshmen a great deal of
power and influence.

Our purpose here is not to find the scapegoat for the al-
ready beleaguered fraternity system. What we want to offer for
consideration is the possibility of delayed rush. Quite obviously
we do not presume to have a panacea for all the ills of fraterni-
ties, but the merits of the delayed rush system have become ap-
parent on campuses throughout the nation. Certainly the fra-
ternity situation at Washington and Lee is unique in many re-
spects. This must not, however, provide an excuse for com-
placency in this area.

Why Not W&L?

Washington and Lee is one of the few schools in this coun-
try of any size that continues to use the early rush system. We
can no longer ignore the success which delayed rush enjoys at
small universities with which W&L is often compared. Too
often in the past we have dismissed this proposal with the
statement that it just wouldn’t work here:

We will be the first to admit that there are several obstacles
to the institution of such a procedure, not the least of which
would be the additional financial strain especially in smaller
houses. In addition, a delayed rush would burden image con-
scious houses as well as increase the opportunity for dirty rush.
Some University officials have indicated that the early rush pro-
gram clears up the matter of fraternities first and allows the
freshmen to begin his work without the distractions of rush.
Positive Side

On the positive side there are a number of points which
deserve attention. The financial dilemma of delayed rush is
perhaps the most thorny. One obvious but not so popular
answer would be financial austerity. Delayed rush would also
eliminate the altogether misleading impression of fraternity
life which rush week now fosters. The delayed rush system need
not interrupt a semester for it can conceivably be scheduled
between semesters.

This comment is not meant to embody a workable plan for
delayed rush at Washington and Lee, rather it is intended to
stimulate, and hopefully to elicit serious consideration of this
proposal by every member of the student body and faculty
Fraternities have a responsibility to themselves, but more im-
portantly, they owe the successive freshmen classes a more
candid and realistic presentation of fraternity life.

Lee University. The mailing address is Box 899, Lexington, Virginia.

By WARD BRIGGS

The purpose of my column this
year will be the same as it was last
year: to amplify and discuss the
subject while serving and I hope in-
teresting you who read it. I am more
or less in the same situation as
you. I am quite interested in movies,
reasonably experienced in them from
seeing them over and over in my
childhood and in talking at great
lengths about them without having
the slightest idea as to how they are
made. I am therefore to be an
amateur among amateurs, rating the
pros.

This fact that we are both ama-
teurs is not a handicap but a credo
or definition. It is an advantage in
the sense that the professionals are
often far too engaged in the prob-
lems of technique, box office, tradi-
tions or the mere physical labor of
putting a picture together to allow
his judgment to perform unblurred.

I may respect Frederic Fellini and
yet detest ninety per cent of 8%
and be able to specify what I detest.
The matter lies in my judgment not
in the fact that I happen to be the
movie columnist for the paper. Were
I a professional, I would so sympa-
thize with the laborious process of
making the movie that I might tend
to be sympathetic a quality which, to
any degree in critics seems excessive.
If we all knew what movies were
all about, we could analyse exactly
what was wrong with a film and
label it as such.

Thus, as amateurs we can recog-
nize our own ignorance and yet feel
no hesitance at expressing our opin-
ions on what we see on the screen
where the proof is caught irrelevant
to excuse and available in propor-
tion to the eye which sees it, and
the mind which uses it.

 

Current Cinema

Role Of Flick Columnist Defined
As Responsible Critic—Enthusiast

 

Job of Critic

What should a good critic do?
Should he be like Shaw and tell
what kind of play should have been
acted instead of the one he just saw.
Should he be like Hazlitt and write
only about acting? Or like Beerbohm
and write about him self.

Most readers want factual reviews.
They want to know the plot, the
characters, is the movie funny or
sad, not good or bad.

Directors usually feel that re-
views affect their movies little if at
all, although destructive criticism
can often spur the director on to new
heights. Few directors though will
be as destroyed by criticism as was
Thomas Hardy after the critics
panned Jude the Obscure.

The responsible critic, however,
should be able to speak to the di-
rector in cinematic terms, despite
what I have said above. There should
be specifies which can be communi-
cated in English, not in any cine-
matic argot, about the movie itself.

In light of this, the critic must
ask himself three questions: 1) What
was the creator trying to do, 2) How
well did he do it? 3) Was it worth
doing? For any critic to be valuable,
he must think both in terms of es-
thetic value and the specific sense
of the film he is reviewing.

The question is one of involve-
ment, of immediacy in the entire
millieu of the film critic. There must
be an excitement about what is now
happening in the movies. If the
critic is not caught up in this, the
point of many movies is quite often
missed and the critic becomes an-
other Bosley Crowther.

Briggs’ Goal
My main goal is to create not only
an informed public opinion, but an

 

 
   
   
  

 

increased public love of motion pic-
tures. The viewer must be conscious
of the film not only as entertain-
ment, but as an exclusive art form.
Here" we must draw a fine line be-
tween appreciation and cultism. By
this I mean that I don’t want to be
a great defender of films who hopes
that one day they will be accepted
as works of art. I mean that films
are the art form of the twentieth
century and they are perhaps the
greatest form of art if art can be
gauged by the degree of effective
involvement it produces in the indi-
vidual. I would never wish to sound
like one who worships the cinema,
but I feel there is a great deal which
can be done to change the attitude
of the public regarding the quality
of motion pictures.

Youth and Movies

The group which most influences
taste is usually the intelligent. In
America today taste is greatly in-
fluenced by youth. On the campuses
today we have these two factors
joined in the student. I am confi-
dent that if more young people re-
quested better movies, better movies
would be made, despite the Holly-
wood involvement in “Box-office.”

This does not mean the critic
should be favorable to good movies
and condemn bad ones. I mean that
the effective critic must be a critic
and propagandist for the cinema as
art and entertainment. He must be
communicable to the public on their
level and the level of the movie-

It is not the purpose of this column
to debate the questions of fraterni-
ties and fraternity life. But since
it must be granted that fraternities
are the pre-eminent institutional
influence on this campus, fraterni-
ty membership has become a prere-
quisite to complete social and extra-
curricular fulfillment. Because of the
gravity of the rushee’s final decision
at the end of rush week, the rush-
ing process must continually undergo
conscientious re-evaluation.

Questions To Face

Part of this critical re-evaluation
consists in weighing both the appar-
ent and obscure advantages and dis-
advantages of fraternity life. For
instance, is the freshman’'s facilitated
assimilation into the traditions of
W&L life worth the sacrifice of his
individual preference? Is his accel-
erated contact with upperclassmen
through his organizational obliga-
tions worth the restrictions this
places on his associations with his
own classmates? Is the fact that the

member's duties was to make sure
his brothers voted straight party.

By MIKE NATION
The upeoming freshman class elec-

tions will inevitably cause the W&L
election system to come under de-
bate again. For the edification of the
freshmen, let's go into a short history
of the conflict.
Old System

At the beginning of last year, the
election system was constitutionally
the same as it is now. However, the
elections were controlled by two po-
litical parties. All the fraternities
belonged to one or the other of the
parties, aligning and realigning
themselves every time the wind
changed direction.

Each party had a clique which
consisted of a representative from
each of the houses within the party,
These two cliques met prior to the
elections and decided who would be
candidates of the party. Needless to
say, the independents had no voice
in the venture.

Clique Nominations

The nominations were usually dis-
tributed to keep all the houses with-
in the individual clique happy and in
line.) Voting usually went straight
down party lines. One of the clique

 

Just prior to the freshman elec-
tions last fall, the minority party
followed the lead of the Sigma Chis,
who had withdrawn from the party
the previous spring, and disbanded
the party. The remaining clique’s
E.C. candidate won, facing badly
splintered opposition.

The remainder of the year was
marked by several attempts to
change the system by amendment of
the student body constitution. All
failed.

Spring Debacle

In the spring elections Fred Min-
del's overwhelming victory over the
one clique’s candidate caused the
elique to recognize the obvious and
disband.

Now we have a system in which
those who want to run for office can
without fear. More important, each
member of the student body has
equal voice in naming his officers
rather than having eighteen young
politicos plotting it all out to suit
their fancy.

Counterproposals

The partyless system, however, has
come under attack, Last spring's

 

class elections were called a “traves-

ty.” No one has bother to explain

how this was, and will be, so. The

student body is still in good shape.
A “Travesty”

One popular counterproposal is that
twe parties be created constitution-
ally. Each would have a “super
clique” consisting of representatives
of every house, the independents and
the law school. Each “super clique”
would then choose the candidates for
the party.

It is not hard to envision that the
same shenanigans prevelant in the
old cliques would again rear their
ugly heads in the name of “the good
of the party.”

Parties Dampen Spirit
"The good of the party” be
damned. The only good that one
muat be concerned with is the good
of the school. Parties and the ensu-
ing loyalty to them enly dilute the
serving of this good,

May all the eager young politicos
on campus vent their wheel-dealing
spirits in the Young Republicans and
in the glorious cause of Ronnie Re-
gan. They are as useful to this
campus as a whistle on a plow.

 

mester worth the possibility of the
disquieting wrong decision? Is the
meal ticket into campus organiza-
tions worth the superficiality and
harrowing disillusionment which fol-
lows any rush week? In short, is
the game worth the candle? Do men
have more to gain or lose by join-
ing a house even before they set
foot in a classroom, and before they
are given the opportunity to ascess
life at Washington and Lee.
Time to Observe

The answer in my opinion must
be a cautiously qualified no; it is
not worth the price. I think that all
of us are in fundamental agreement
that a rush system, if it is to be
found suitable, must provide maxi-
mum opportunity to the freshman in
making this important decision. It
must give him the widest lattitude
possible in comparing all fraernitties,
not merely ten or twelve; that it
must enable him to develop a sni-

cere relationship with the majority
of brothers in a fraternity, not three
or four; that it must give the fresh-
man time to observe the prevailing
attitudes of a fraternity relative to
academic achievement and other im-
portant considerations. Time is the
only means by which these can be
given the proper concern and de-
tachment.

Thus, to me, the fraternity rush
system seems lacking in that the
most valuable commodity in the
making of any decision. For surely
the more time there is given to a
person to make his decision, the
more chance there will be that the
ultimate choice will be correct. Per-
haps were the freshman to be given
his own amount of time to go
through rush and accept a bid when
convenient, within a reasonable
amount of time, he might feel more
at ease during this critical emotional
and academic period, and he might
not be expected to make his final
decision in a frantic and often
drunken frenzy on Wednesday night,
or a soul-searching hour on Thurs-
day. This is but one of the incon-
gruities of our present rush system
which I feel might be made more
efficient by a scrupulous assessment
of one of the University’s most vital
operations.

Opening Assembly;

Discusses Traditions
By BRUCE W. RIDER

Not many days ago I chanced to be
loping about the campus so I decided
to go to take a peek at the ODK
(Old Damned Kaiser) board to notice
the notices.

Pushing my way through 330 eager
freshmen I made it up to the board
and read that the Opening Assembly,
the Festivals of Festivals, was to be
held in Evans Dining Hall (the place
with the fat crest on it.)

Now this may not be a big thing
for you new students or you pro-
gressive types, but for conservative
me it was a Break with Tradition.

No longer would we wend our
way up the lovely steps of the
lovely gymnasium to take our
places in the sweaty hall as gen-
crations had done before us. No
longer would we listen to speeches
given under the basketball net. No
longer would we come to the As-
sembly late so we could sit up-
stairs and play cards on the wrest-
ling mat. Jlere was another tradi-
tion done away with. Woe is us!

To quite honest with you,
friends—and you are my friends—I
felt a little shaky as I rode by skate-
board to the Dining Hall on the ap-
pointed day. (Do you know what
happens if you skip one of the As-
semblies? Aha!)

I usually like to sit in back at such
a meeting, on the theory that if you
sit in back you don’t have to sit up
front.

be

I picked out a comfy metal chair
at the back and sat down (1 had to
leap over a rope somebody was
holding in a vain attempt to get
people to sit up front). Soon after
I had gotten settled the organist
(not the usual record player or
tape recorder) lit into Purcell’s
Trumpet Tune in D and the faculty
lumbered in two by two.

So far everything was new and
different. I was beginning to feel
insecure. But then one of the gentle-
men on the platform came through
for me with the Annual Post Office
Announcement. To us old-timers,
this is a very emotional speech, and I
was heartened to know it was still
the main part of the Opening As-
sembly.

After this fine address another one
was given which showed the fresh-
men that at W&L we face the big
issues of our time. On this campus
we seek to get beyond the mere
surface of things, unlike all those
other places where students are al-
ways marching off to Washington or
debating about Viet Nam or rioting
over freedom of speech.

No, the challenge facing the
young men at Washington and Lee
in 1965 is far greater: Should He
Wear a Tie.

And, seeing that many students
were coatless at the Assembly and.
noting the lack of proper dress and
manners since the Assembly, I would
say that this particular speech went
over like a coat and tie in a punch-
bowl.

Notice

There will be a meeting of the
Independent Union, Thursday, Sep-
tember 30, at 7 pm. in Room 27 of
the Student Union. All independents,
especially freshmen, are urged to at-
tend. The future of the IU and the
independent student in general will
be discussed. Officers will also be
elected.

Freshmen are reminded that
there is a compulsory orientation

Defines Upperclassmen’s Role In Assimilation

By ROY TYLER
Tuesday Columnist

There has been much talk since
the the beginning of rush week that
this freshman class is the best one
to enter Washington and Lee in
many years. What this word “better”
entails, is always, however, never
explained.

The college board averages of this
freshman class were “better.” the
placement test averages of this class
were “better,"and there are even
some “better” basketball players.

To what, however, does being a
“better” class entitle the freshmen?
Does it entitle members of the fresh-
man class to immediately be ac-
cepted as, what some students might
term, “first class students”?

A freshman is a first year student
He knows little ef the customs,
traditions, and way of life of the
university in which he is enrolled
What he learns, he learns from the
upperclassmen

So what? This seems so obvious
that it should go without saying

 

There is a message for all upper-
classmen in this idea... not the usual
one of “... set a good example,” but
make certain that freshmen not only
respect the traditions that have been
strengthened through many decades,
but that freshmen show some respect
to the upperclassmen.

Many would label this “putting a
freshman in his place”; and this,
essentially, is what it involves. It
does not mean that a freshman be
stifled in his creative pursuits. nor
does it mean that he should refrain
from speaking when he has some-
thing to say

It does, however,

mean that he

takes into consideration that this is|
his first year at Washington and Lee, |
is told to do and)

and that what he
what is expected of him is done so
because of a definite reason, He is
told not to walk on the grass, not
becatuse it will destroy the grass, but
because this is an upperclass privi-
lege

When an upperclassman sees a
freshman walking across the grass, ot

walking to the post office without a
coat and tie, it is his responsibility
to inform the freshman that he is
stepping out of line

Perhaps privileges do not belong
in voting, but it has a place in col-
lege life

Privilege is not, however, what all
of this involves. It is more a ques-
tion of respect, both to the Univer-
sity and to each upperclassman,

A child must learn to crawl be-
learns to walk. Assuredly
the child will fall many times before
he can walk. Often he will be hurt.
but there usually is semeone around
to help him up. This is true also of
freshmen. They too make mistakes,
ind it is the responsibility of upper-
clasemen to help the freshman, er
often demand that the mistakes be
corrected

Carpenter Highlights Game

(Continued from page 3)

The Generals have a partial excuse
in that several key players were
either out with injuries or playing
with ailments. The retirement of
Tommy Sparks also played a major
role in the Generals’ lack of a strong
ground game. One should not be too
harsh on Bryant Kendrick for allow-
ing his man to catch the winning
touchdown pass because Kendrick
was playing with a bad knee and
was a questionable starter a few
hours before game time.

Outstanding Generals

There were a few heartening fac-
tors, though. Bob Barclay, who came
out this year only five days before
the opening game, punted like a
pro until his last two kicks when he
probably became leg weary as they
were his sixth and seventh punts.
The other men in evidence were
guard Tom Day and halfback Mike
Day, who showed flashes of
brilliance last year, was particularly
effective on the trap play and the
sweeps. Tom may be developing into
the best blocking guard in Virginia.

There is a funny story about
Goode. Mike did not join the team
at the beginning of training because
he felt that the weather was too
hot. Mike was not expected to play
too much in the first couple of

by, Kendrick, Billy Andrews, and
Luke Crosland forced him into ac-
tion. As it turned out, Mike was the
outstanding General on the field
Saturday. He returned two kickoffs
for 51 yards and was the star of the
defensive backfield with his many
tackles and solid pass defense. His
second kockoff return almost de-
veloped into a touchdown as the
last man between him and the goal
line managed to knock him out of
bounds.

Smith Surprises

Rudd Smith, sophomore halfback
who was shoved into a starting role
when Brooky was injured, also de-
serves credit for his strong effort.
Although Rudd’s statistics were not
overly impressive, it was evident to
the average fan that he played a

fine game despite his inexperience.

dent, could develop into another
