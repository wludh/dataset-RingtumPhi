String Quartet

By JOHN CARRERE
Under the sponsorship of the Con-
cert Guild, The Washington and Lee
campus will be visited Wednesday
by the nationally-known Iowa String
Quartet. The program will begin at
8 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Since its debut in 1958, the en-
semble has drawn much praise
from critics around the nation. A
performance at the Phillips Mem-
orial Gallery in Washington, D. C.,
during an East Coast tour, gener-
ated the words “a quartet whose
art is extraordinary.” Commenda-
tion was forthcoming again and
again as the group fulfilled some
twenty-five engagements in the
mid-West during 1962 and 1963.

First violinist Allen Ohems has

Protesting Exclusion
Of Frosh Prrents

Trespass Warrents Urged
To Ban Partying Townies
In Other IFC Action

By STEVE SAUNDERS
News Editor

A resolution deploring the exclu-
sion of freshmen’s parents from
Parents Weekend was passed unan-
imously at last night’s IFC meting.
Addressed to the Parents’ Advisory
Council, which is scheduled to meet
here on Friday, the resolution
pledged to assist in finding some so-
lution to the problem.

The University said that the new
policy was prompted by insufficient
sleeping and eating facilities.

Cannon Offers Motion

Billy Cannon, IFC vice-president,
headed a committee appointed pre-
viously to formulate such a resolu-
tion. Almost all fraternities expressed
dissatisfaction with the new policy.
Most felt that it was important for
the freshmen parents to see their
sons’ fraternities first-hand, and to
learn more about life at Washing-
ton and Lee.

There was some discussion prior to
last night's meeting about the possi-
bility of separate Parents’ Weekends
for each of the four classes, such as
is the practice at Randolph-Macon
and other schools.

The resolution passed last night's
meeting without discussion.

Right Direction
Parents’ Advisory Council
will consider the IFC resolution
when it meets at the end of this
week. Some form of reaction is ex-
pected. Cannon noted, in presenting
his motion, that the University ad-
ministration is not intractable, and
is “willing to move in the right di-
rection in future years, in fullest
cooperaton with the students.”

Rowdy Townies

A solution to the problem of
townies invading fraternity house
parties on weekends was offered by
Barry Vaught, Town Relations
Chairman. Vaught suggested in the
form of a motion that all eighteen
fraternities, acting in unison, pr-
chase general trespass warrants pro-
hibiting certain known “party-

THE RING-TUM PHI

Tuesday Edition

In The Shadows Too Long

One of the most controversial aspects of the University
Self-Study Program is the evaluation of the McCormick Li-
brary. It is the policy of the Self-Study Committee to release
very little, if indeed any, information regarding findings or
recommendations of the Library Committee. Unfortunately, all
too little is known about the financial resources or actual con-
tent of our library.

 

 

Release Survey

In an attempt to shed some light on the relative merits of
the library, the Ring-tum Phi plans to publish a heretofore ob-
scure survey taken last fall in the spirit of the self-study pro-
gram of evaluation. The poll involving a representative number
of institutions of comparable size and background contains a
number of vital statistics which invariably place our library near
the bottom.

We will be the first to admit that statistics do not tell the
whole story about this or any other library. Numerical con-
tent is only one criterion by which the adequacy or inadequacy
of a library should be judged. Nevertheless, we do feel that
the survey is of general interest to the student body, and par-
ticularly pertinent to the uninformed critic of the library.

There seems to be some reluctance on the part of those in
possession of the report to release it at this time, but we should
like to point out that rumors concerning the existence of such
report and its content are widespread. In the interests of clarity
we urge that the paranoia which has surrounded this report
from the beginning be alleviated, and that a careful and dispas-
sionate appraisal be rendered.

Unhealthy and Archaic

Constructive criticism must be taken in the spirit in which it
is offered. It is somewhat distressing to note that those persons
responsible for this survey have been persuaded that it would
be unwise to promote its general circulation at this time. This
seems to indicate a certain stigma attached to the preparation
of any disconcerting survey pertaining to our academic com-
munity. Obviously, this is a most unhealthy climate if, indeed,
it is typical, and we can only lament the continued existence
of these archaic attitudes.

The final report of the Self-Study Program will not be
presented until the fall of 1966. In the meantime, we trust that
the University will eliminate the aura of secrecy surrounding
the entire effort.

 

Requiescat In Pace

It decayed last Fall. It failed last Winter. It withered last
Spring. And this October, it appears that the speaking tradi-
tion—one of warmest characteristics of Washington and Lee—
has finally died.

What can be said in obituary? What sort of funeral oration
is in order?

Tradition, Speaking. Aged 100 years. Died of severe ne-
glect, compounded by gradual paralysis and a near-unanimous
disconcern. Speaking will repose in the pages of the University
catalogue where the friends he never had in life may now safely
pay their respects. He is survived by Conventional Dress, and
mourned by 20,000 living alumni and faculty. The family re-
quests that flowers be omitted.

The symptoms of Speaking’s final illness were easily rec-
ognizable. They could be noticed every morning when a fresh-
man didn’t speak to another student, or worse, when he did and
was greeted by a humilating silence. They could be detected
when professors were reluctant to walk around campus during

period changes, for fear of having their “Good Mornings” re- |

turned with an icy stare, or at best a growled and grudging mon-
osyllable. It could be plainly seen when alumni would return
home after visits to Lexington, mildly horrified and personally
hurt by the studied indifference and seeming discourtesy of his
school’s students.

It could be seen, detected, and noticed by anybody con-
cerned enough to open his ears, and it could have been correct-
ed by anyone with sense enough to open his mouth, and speak.
But it wasn’t corrected, and enough mouths weren't opened.

Speaking passed quietly away in the night, with a minimum
of discomfort. Most didn’t even know he had gone; he certainly
wasn't conspicuous by his absence. The Assimilation Committee
didn’t even send their condolences.

Belated tears, and the most convincing sorrow cannot bring
the old Speaking Tradition back. But a new one can be born,
even if it too will someday decay, fail, wither and die, for such is
the nature of tradition, In the meanwhile, we must mourn,
Speaking was an old man and it is sad to see old men die.

By WARD BRIGGS

Richard HI coming to the Lyric is
the third of Olivier’s great Shake-

speare films, His first, Henry V
(1947) ranks as one of the greatest
motion pictures on record, and his
Hamlet (1949) is close behind. This
movie marks the handling of Rich-
ard’s extensive, challenging mono-
logues on the screen.

The handsome, sophisticated
Olivier of Rebecca and Wuthering
Heights now becomes the grotes-
que, hunchback king with a force
comparable only to the Lyric’s
proprietor’s. The color is mag-
nificent as the crowning ceremony
in the vast Catholic cathedral dis-
perses and leaves Richard alone on
the throne to contemplate his reyv-
olution.

Oliver treats the long speeches
with polish and maintains the facial
mobility so necessary in the movies,
but so minor on the stage. This fa-
cial mobility plus the toning of the
voice and staying in one spot for an
extended period of time are just
a few of the many problems Shake-
sperean actors (Richard Burton, for

 

Current Cinema

 

Briggs Praises Olivier's
“Richard III” At Lyric

one) fine so impossible to accom-
modite to in the movies. |

Olivier, probably the greatest |
Shakespearean actor alive, today has
mastered this technique of motion
without movement and amply dem-
onstrates it in this movie.

As with the other two movies,
this one was adopted, produced,
and directed by the star, and a
magnificent job has been done in
all fields. The regular 34% hour
play has been cut to 2 hours with
all the major soliloquies retained.
The sets, both in the interiors
which were shot in a real castle,
and the exteriors which were
filmed on the fields of Lancashire,
Oliver’s camera moves and stands
still with a perfect understanding
of movement within the play.

The final scene with the famous
“A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a
horse” has been the subject of great
discusions among professional Shake-
spearians: Whether it is to take place
with Richard alone on an empty
field of battle or surrounded by
troops in the thick of fighting. Oliver

 

very wisely puts the scene in a little

 

grove away from the battle but with
battle sounds distinetly heard. His
shout falls on no ears, and he seems
caught in his own plan as he has
wandered off on his own junket
leaving the welfare of his men to
chance.

The final death scene is, I be-
lieve, one of the greatest on cel-
luloid, and Oliver uses it to full ad-
vantage to put a fitting end te one
of Shakespeare’s most detestable
heroes. There is no mourning for
him, only a rather quiet gratitude
that this vermin has been removed
from the nation,

Olivier is the classic villain, the
great anti-hero and for many reasons
this is a film which must be seen not
only for the unexeelled acting and
unequalled direction, but the script
is fair, also.

Presently in the works is a black
and white film version of Oliver's
Othello which was a smash on the
the London stage a year ago. I hope
the years have not dulled Olivier’s
talent as a director for they have
surely advanced his reputation as
one of Britain’s greatest actors.

At the present time, Washington
and Lee suffers from the same prob-
lems as the city
of Los Angeles.
Most obvious is
the problem of the
automobile, which
is devouring Los
Angeles and over-
running W&L.
The most serious
common _ prob-
lem though, is
that of a pattern of
growth that has
left both without
a center. Los Angeles has no focus;
its growth is confused and chaotic.

 

 

Los Angeles cannot find itself, the
city is lest in its own jumble.
Lack of Focus

If Les Angeles suffers from ur-
ban sprawl, the W&L version must
be a rural sprawl. One of the great-
est problems of our campus is its
lack of focus. The Washington Col-
lege Group, Newcomb Hall and
Tucker Hall form one long axis. This
is limited on the north end by du-
Pont Hall and is vaguely defined at
the other end by the Freshman
dorms and gym.

There is a natural flow of people
along the major axis, but there is
no cross axis or stopping point to
break this flow. The physical center
of the major axis is Washington Hall,

 

Life-In-Our-Times Department: A Parable

 

By BRUCE W. RIDER
Once upon a time there appeared
on a very small bulletin board at
a very small col

lege a sign.

The sign said
simply, “No
Goats.”

No fuss, no
muss, no noise-

just these two sim-
ple words on a
small piece of
paper on a bulle-
tin board.

It so happened
that in the partie-

 

 

lular kingdom in which this college
was located, the king and his advis-
ors advocated a pro-goat policy. But
it was admitted throughout the realm
that this was a land of freedom, and
that the subjects should be allowed
to express peaceably whatever opin-
| jons they might happen to have.

It was also true that in the vil-
lage where the college was, and in
the college itself, the majority of
the people were pro-goat, and most
of the people preferred quiet ways.
In fact, there was seldom any real
controversy about anything, except
in the rather mild area of apparel:
a few upstarts did not want to wear
the traditional leather suspenders
and some wanted to shed part of
the traditional outer garment. Other-
wise, all was tranquil.

But elsewhere in the kingdom
people had spoken out against the
pro-goat policy of the king,
eventually the issue had made it-
self felt in this isolated little col-
lege in this isolated little town,

Soon after the ‘no goat’ sign ap-
peared, people began to seraw! anon-
ymous obscene phrases upon the
sign. It thus appeared that pro-goat
people were the same
write nasty things on
walls

bathroom

sign caused such a great big fuss

Many people said that of course
they
right to express opinion—but they
certainly did not think that the anti-
goat position should be allowed ex-
pression. After all, there are limits.

Truth to tell, a great deal of hate

It is interesting to note that in
anoher kingdom, far, far away, no
one was ever allowed to deviate from

where the college was there had
been a long tradition of freedom of

Burning Draft Card Doesn't Help

W&L And Los Angeles Without A Focal Point;
Student Union Should Be The Rallying Point

but it is not a center in the sense
that people naturally congregate
there; instead they walk on by.
What Washington and Lee needs is
a square or crossing point which
draws people together in their idle
moments, a place in which people
can meet and stop by chance to be
involved in spontaneous exchange of
conversation and ideas. Walking
along the Colonnade at the present
time similar to driving on an
Interstate Highway. There is a min-
imum speed and no place to pause.
What the campus needs is an area
similar to a winding country road,

Points of Dispersal

The above analysis is a personal
impression of the interaction of peo-
ple on the Washington and Lee cam-
pus. In New York one rallying point
is Washington Square; and in Venice
it is St. Mark’s Square. Here at W&L
we do not have a rallying point:
we have points of dispersal, Doc’s,
the Liquid, the Co-op, the apart-

ments, fraternity houses, and the
dorms.
The answer to the need for an

area of confluence and conversation
is the New Student Union, but al-
ready part of its value is to be di-
minished. The sight is to be off the
center of the campus in a_ place
which draws only a limited portion
of the students and faculty. The
present Co-op, is not a natural gath-
ering point.

Alternative Sites

There appear to be two and pos-
sibly three alternative locations for
the student union, all preferable to
the proposed site. Of primary im-
portance for a site is natural draw-
ing power and convenience. The most
advantageous position would be the

Tyler Defends
U.S. In Current

Defensive War

By ROY TYLER

Victnam, Vietnam, Vietnam
Everybody talks about it, but no-
body does anything about it.

Last week I saw a newspaper col-
umn that was quite typical of the
type of column
that has recently
been appearing in
newspapers’ all
over the country.

Essentially what
the columnist was
saying was that
the United States
forces in Vietnam
' are there to pro-
! ™ tect the Vietna-
Tyler mese people, and

all they are ac-
complishing is the murder of inno-
cent women and children, often by
American forces themselves. In the
name of humanity, this column went
on, we should withdraw from Viet-
nam and end this “useless” killing.
Our purpose in Vietnam was to save
the lives of the Vietnamese people,
so why do we stay there and cause
more killing?

 

My answer to this columnist is
that he has completely misjudged
our purpose for remaining in Viet-
nam. We are not in Vietnam, no
matter how cruel it may seem to
some “humanitarian” ears, to merely
protect the Vietnamese people. We
are there to protect the American
people.

There is no reason for the Ameri-
can people to go on kidding them-
selves and the rest of the world. We
are fighting in Vietnam to keep com-
munism from engulfing Southeast
Asia in the interest of the United
States,

Do people actually believe that the
Communists will stop with the
conquest of Vietnam? Are there peo-
ple whe are convinced that we can
withdraw from Vietnam, hide our
heads under a blanket, and pretend
that the communists will not move
further into Southeast Asia?

Isn't it logical that the communist
will continue to take advantage of
the continual withdrawal of Ameri-
can troops?

Those who attempt to analyze the
situation in Vietnam in an attempt to
prove that we cannot possibly help
the Vietnamese people, are continu-
ally complicating a relatively sim-
ple matter. I am not stating that the
Vietnamese war is a simple matter;
I am stating that our objectives are
simple...we must drive the com-
munists out of Vietnam, not merely
because we feel that the Vietnamese
want to do this, but because it
is in our own interest to do so.

When we realize that we are fight-
ing in Vietnam to protect ourselves,
than perhaps misguided young
Americans will eease burning their
draft cards and begin thinking how
they can help themselves by fighting
for their country.

Fourth Quarter FG Nips Generals, 9-7

U. Defeat

JE FRERET

Perhaps the sweetness of the Guilford victory or perhaps a

light regard for the Western

Maryland team occupied the

minds of the Generals when they played host to the Maryland
club Saturday, but whatever the reason be, the Generals were
rudel yawakened when Paul McClintock, a 200 pound senior,

kicked a 30 yard field goal with 1:446*—

left in the game to provide the visi-
tors with their margin of victory in
handing W&L a 9-7 defeat.

The Generals started where they
had left off Guilford the
week before by marching 51 yards
to score the first time they got the
ball. Bryant Kendrick, calling only
on his backfield grind out the
yardage, sent fullback John Anthony
over left tackle from 5 yards out
to put up the first points on the
scoreboard. Skip Jacobsen then con-
verted the extra point, and W&L
led, 7-0. But this was to be the ex-
tent of the Generals’ offense as they
could not generate anything resem-
bling a drive for the rest of the day.

to

An example of their inability to
control the ball and march for a
score came after Starke Sydnor
blocked a Western Maryland punt
following W&L’'s touchdown to
give the Generals the ball on the
visitors’ 30 yard line, Unable to
move, the Generals relinquished
the ball on downs.

Noteworthy the Washington
and Lee defense, which had its back
on the goal line just before the half
ended following a_ blocked
Smith punt. Western Maryland
marched to the W&L two yard line
where it had first and goal. A penalty
moved the ball to the one, but the
offensive efforts were repulsed by
the Generals’ staunch defense. West-
ern Maryland was foreed to give up
the ball on the two yard line on
downs

Western Maryland started the sec-
ond half by marching to a first down
on W&L’s 6 vard line. Three plays
netted four yards and on fourth
down and two to go for the touch-
down Smith blitzed through his de-
fensive wingback position to spill the

possession of the football

Late in the third quarter Western
Maryland began to march again, and
the quarter terminated with the visi-
tors on the W&L 16 yard line. On
the first play of the fourth quarter,

Then late in the game Western

age in a last ditch drive for a
touchdown and victory. With

‘Swan Calls It Wat |
As Frosh Lose 2nd |

Most people call it football, but
| Coach Dana Swan calls it war when!
|speaking of Friday’s game played |
between the Washington and Lee |
Brigadiers and Fork Union Military
Academy. He said that the Generals
fought hard but lost because of de-
fensive lapses, as FUMA was victor-
ious, 18-8.

The big difference in the game was
FUMA’s ability to come up with the
big play. The decisive touchdown
came after W&L had failed to hold
the hosts on a fourth and nine siuta-
tion. Until that point the Generals
had led, 8-6.

The Brigadiers’ lone tally had
come late in the second period when
they had recovered a FUMA fumble
on the home club’s 15 yard line.
Charlie Freret carried 12 yards to
the three, and then Dee Cannon went
over the middle three plays later for
the score. Quaterback Alan Tomlin
passed to Freret for the two points,
and W&L led 8-6 at the half.

FUMA scored early in the third
| quarter and again in the fourth. Lack
je depth hurt the Brigadiers as sev-
| eral players were injured in the first
| half. Swan noted John Wolf, Rein
Fischer and Mark Heatwole for good
play on defense. Cannon, Tomlin,
and halfback Jeb Brown paced the
offense .Brown was injured, leaving |
the game with a split lip.

Friday the Generals entertain
the Bridgewater J.V. in Lexington. |
The Eagles are 0-1, while the Briga-
diers are even for four games.

Gains Revenge
In 2-1 Game

On a weekend sojourn to the Big
City of the Birds and the Beagles,
the soccer team of Washington and
bent revenge, nipped the
American University Eagles in a
close contest, 2-1. Last year it was at
the hands of American U. that the
Generals’ six game victory streak
was broken.

Lee, on

During the first half of the game,
the W&L eleven was held scoreless
by the opposition. The field was wet,
;and the rainy cold weather bogged
|down the attacks of both squads.
| However, the Eagles managed to
| score their first and only goal of the
game, and the score was 1-0 against
the Generals at the midway point.

 

Initial Score

In the third period the Washing-
ton and Lee team rallied for its ini-
tial score and locked the score at
1-1. The tally was made on a well
directed corner kick by senior co-
captain Tim Henry that was headed
into the goal by Dave Kirkpatrick.

As American U. was held scoreless
the entire second half, W&L receiv-
ed the decisive goal in the final
period on a penalty kick by Henry.
With this kick, Henry increased his
tem-leading total of goals to seven
and enabled the Generals to obtain
their fourth win of the season
opposed to three defeats.

place greater emphasis on human

Dr. Machlup went on to discuss
seven fundamental errors often made
concerning freedom. First is the con-
fusion of “freedom to” with “freedom
from.” He pointed out that “freedom
from” means “absence of” and is
not strictly speaking, a freedom.
Next, there is the previously men-

and “I can.” A third error is in the
idea that it is always the state which
interferes with freedom. He went
on to discus that it is not true that
freedom can be secured only by the
state.
He also stated that freedom is not,

many believe, the absence of
coercion. For, he said, there must be
state coercion to put down those who
would restrict freedom.

economic fredoms. Of particular
note, he pointed out that the fight of
revolution, which was so staunchly
defended by our forefathers such as
Jefferson, and Lincoln, has fallen in-
to great disfavor in modern society.
