Appoints Five New Officers

 

CONTACT Committee Selected

By MIKE BARK

Under the co-chairmanship of Phil

Claxton, Kappa Sig junior, and
Roger Sennott, a senior, Contact will
hold its second annual series of

lectures and speeches on February
11, 12 and 13. The Contact program
was instituted last year under the
auspices of the  Interfraternity
Council. It was conceived to fill an
intellectual void and arouse student
interest.

Several students have been ap-
pointed to positions in Contact. Nick
Ruffin, an independent senior will |
be a special assistant. Bruce Kramer,

 

Foreign Gervies Officer Speaks :

a ZBT senior, will be in charge of
registration. Chris Miller, a Phi Ep
sophomore, will be secretary of the
organization. Jody Luck, of Pi Kap-
pa Phi, is the IFC representative as
well as social chairman. Jody Kline,
a Phi Kap sophomore, is to be pro-
gram co-ordinator,

There are still two positions left
open. Claxton furthered, “We are
still looking for a treasurer. His job
will be very demanding as he has
to help us raise funds.” A publicity
chairman is also needed. It is prefer-
red that juniors or seniors apply for
these positions. There are other jobs

 

 

To Students On Training, Duties

Daniel H. Clare, UI, of the US. |
State Department spoke to W&L |
juniors and seniors in duPont Hall, |
Thursday, October 7 at 2 p.m. on the
subject of the United States Foreign |
Service.

Mr. Clare, who just returned from
Ecuador on home leave, first showed
a film entitled “The Unending Strug-
gle.” which shows the activity of
Foreign Service Officers during “one
day in one nation.” He then spent
some time in a general question-and-
answer session, after which he in-
vited individual questions.

The film designed to show what
F'SO's do in the field, was a series
of scenes, all unstaged and live,
showing different FSO’s in Eeuador,
from the then ambassador, Maurice
Bernbaum, now ambasador to Ven-
ezuela, through the United States
Information Service Chief, the Con-
sul, the Chief of the Political Section,
the Labor Attache down to the
Army. Each was shown periorming
one phase of his job: canvassing stu-
dent opinions, selling US.LS. radio

Faculty Advisors

The faculty advisors for this year’s
program will be Dr. Edward Pinney
of the Political Science Department,
Dr. Archie Robertson of Law, Dr.
John Gunn of Economies, Dr. Louis
Hodges of Religion and Dr. Charles
Turner of the History Department.

The program will be entitled “The
American Experience.” This will also
be the topic of debate every year.
Last year the speeches concerned the
United States on the domestic scene
and the role it plays in world affairs.
Among the speakers were a CIA
representative and Dr. Silver, author
of Mississippi: Closed Society. The
latter's spech “packed Lee Chapel,”
according to Phil Claxton, “as the
students wanted to hear this man
who is so well known for his criti-
cisms of the South.”

This year the organization of the
program will be improved. Claxton
stated that “there will be four to
six categories from which the stu-
dent will be able to choose. For those
who are really interested in a par-
ticular topic, seminars limited in
number to 25 will be held. The stu-
dents will have to read books by
the lecturer before they attend these
seminars.”

The faculty has recommend-
ed three seniors as representa-
tives of Washington and Lee
in the competition for Rhodes

Scholarships this year: Joe

Miller, Fred Mindel, and Bill
Washburn.

Miller, captain of the varsity foot-
ball team, Dean’s List, and president
of Fancy Dress, will apply in his
home state of Tennessee. If he is
successful in the competition. he will
“read” history at Oxford University
next year.

Mindel, president of the Student
Body, and a major in English, will
apply from Virginia rather than
Ohio, where his home is. Mindel
would hope to read in Jurisprudence
at Oxford.

Washburn, major in Economics
and sixth ranking scholar in his
class, for three years manager of the
swimming team, would also apply
from Virginia, and if successful,
would read in Modern Greats (eco-
nomics, political science, and philos-
: ophy).

Conferences will be held in the
various states in December, at which
time sixteen Rhodes Scholars from
all over the country will be chosen
for a two-year stay at Oxford. The
scholarships were established early
in this century by Cecil Rhodes, in
order to draw together the best
young men from the English-speak-
ing countries.

One of last year’s W&L candidates,
Tim Vanderver, won a Rhodes schol-
arship and is now in Oxford.

The announcement was made by
Dr. James G. Leyburn, chairman of
the Rhodes Scholarship Committee.

 

Magazine Editor To Visit
Department of Journalism

Paul Herron, editor of Potemac
Magazine. the Sunday supplement
of the Washington Post, will visit
Washington and Lee University’s de-
partment of journalism and com-
munications Friday and Saturday.

Herron will be gathering informa-
tions and pictures for an article on
the department, which was founded
in 1925 as the Lee Memorial Jour-
nalism Foundation, and whose or-
igins trace back to the years when
Gen. Robert E. Lee was president of
the school. The department moved
into new quarters in Reid Hall, com-
pletely remodeled to provide jour-
nalism facilities, in September, 1964.

Tonight at 7:30 p.m. Herron will
speak to journalism majors in the
Reid Hail Library.

Parents’ Weekend

Many students became extremely upset Monday when
Dean Atwood confirmed reports that Freshman Class parents
would be excluded from this year’s Parents’ Weekend activities.
We feel their complaints are just.

The decision, which was made last year by the Parents’
Council, was the result of the growing number of parents who
attended the annual affair. The lack of housing facilities neces-
sitated the move. But we feel this does not justify dropping
the program for freshmen parents, but rather gives strong
justification for such a program.

A substitute program, for frosh parents, which was held
on Labor Day this year, was inserted to replace the weekend
which gives parents an opportunity to observe student life at
Washington and Lee.

However, this type program is grossly inadequate simply
because student life at that early date (what student life?)
answers none of the questions which no doubt have taxed
middle-aged minds.

Although the faculty contends that they can tell nothing
to parents about freshman grades at such an early date, many
parents would rather hear it from the professor’s mouth, than
read on an IBM sheet 500-miles away that their son (“who's
always made good grades’) has three S’s and two U’s.

The major question most parents want to know, however,
is “what kind of boys are in the fraternity my son pledged?”

Stories surrounding fraternities, especially from a parent’s

view, can be alarming. Most have no real basis. Yet, if “Our |

Johnny” has trouble, grade-wise or otherwise, the fraternity is
immediately blamed. Many charges aimed at fraternities are un-
just, however, the fraternity has no opportunity to prove it-
self. This is a factor the Parents’ Council neglected; yet it is
a factor which has a great deal of validity.

Parents’ Weekend is not an opportunity to “fleece naive
parents” as the administrator contends, but rather an oppor-
tunity to build good public relations between parents and
fraternity. The human, by instinct, questions the unknown.
That’s why it’s imperative parent-fraternity relations begin be-
fore the sophomore year. And that’s the reason fraternities are
finding themselves in an embarrassing position this week at-
tempting to tactfully tell the same parents they sent letters to
last week encouraging them to attend Parents’ Weekend that
the University “doesn’t want them.”

A second factor we feel should be noted. Much of the
enthusiasm of Parents’ Weekend in the past has been generated
by freshman parents. We feel that as a result of a pleasant first
experience many enjoy returning. However, after their son has
become completely acclimated to his new environment they
wouldn’t be as likely to come for the first time.

Thirdly, most parents, whether they can attend or not,
view a special weekend specifically for them as a sign the Uni-
versity cares. The Labor Day fiasco they view as nothing more
than common courtesy.

The IFC plans to present a resolution to the Parents’
Council when it meets on October 29. It is hoped that the
group will have foresight to realize that Washington and Lee
is depriving many parents an opportunity, which otherwise they
may not take, to become an active part of this University.

‘Am I Destroying Washington and Lee?’

 

Mr. Lee Kahn, the new professor
of drama and director of the Trou- |
badour Theatre at W&L, is a man|
with a goal.

He wants to make the University’s
drama into true educa-
tional theatre. It isn’t now, he says.

the white liberal,
the great champion of the civil rights

surely alienated by excesses that
were becoming more and more out

Kahn is looking forward especial-

Dear Sir,

I was surprised to hear the ques-

from Mr. Ruffin’s comments (The
Ring-tum Phi, October 5, 1964) on
Tuesday that he knew a number of
W&L law students and that a num-

ber of the W&L law students must
surely know him. This assumption
was justified, I think, in view of

the “inside” information (obviously
obtained through inter-
views with law students) contained

Mr. Ruffin, why de you suppose one

An opening address to the first
year law students informed us that
less than 40 per cent of graduating
students actually practice law. Does
this mean that at least 60 per cent
of those attending law school lack
direction or are surprisingly naive?
Of cour not; all this means is that

Soccer Team
Injuries Slow

WE&L Offense

Washington and Lee’s varsity soc-
cer team evened out its record at
2-2 dropping the fourth game of
the season Wednesday to Lynchburg
College, 4-1. W&L, suffering from
some injuries, could never mount
much of an offensive until Claude
Rogers finally scored in the fourth
period.

Lynchburg dominated the game.
They started off with a quick score
by White after only three minutes of
play. According to Coach Joe Lyles,
this score set up the momentum for
future Lynchburg points. The rest
of the first period consisted of hold-
ing off the powerful Lynchburg
drives.

Defense held for most of the sec-
ond quarter. However, the highly
talented freshman white scored
again for Lynchburg with 8:22 left
in the period. This goal ended the
scoring for the first half.

The third period seemed very sim-
ilar to the first. Again, White scored
after about three minutes of play and
again, W&L was occupied with pro-
tecting its end of the field. It was
all the Generals could do to keep
Lynchburg from scoring.

The fourth quarter brought about |

scores by both teams. Langsday
scored the final point for Lynchburg
and Rogers, with an assist by Al
Craig, scored the single point of the
game for the Generals. The second
squads of both teams played the
majority of the final period. Lynch-
burg made 37 attempts at scoring
while W&L made five.

An outstanding job was accom-
plished by Ward Briggs, who saved
17 goals for the Generals.

Injuries probably played a part in
the loss according to Coach Lyles.
The injuries to some varsity players
hindered practice during the week
and as a result, the team was a little
bit cold in its passing and heading.

Today, the Generals host Davis and
Elkins at 3:15 p.m.

NOTICE

If the person who forgetfully slip-
ped a typewriter belonging to the
Ring-tum Phi into his pocket and
walked off with it Wednesday night
will return it to the Ring-tum Phi
office under cover of darkness, he
will probably go  unprosecuted
though unforgiven.

Bensinger Outbids Tues.

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

Congratulations to the Tuesday
edition, Harry Aggannis, and a six-
pack of Busch (why six Busches?
One would do). However, the Friday
edition will not let this bush league
attempt to rouse reader interest
prevail. From the office tomes of
Ford “Do Nothing” Frick comes a
dazzier good for a bottle of cham-
pagne (Tuesday staff take note: this
is a major league). The Los Angeles
Dodgers, with an as yet still unoffi-
cal .245 team batting average, will
most likely possess the lowest sea-
son batting of a World
Series contestant in modern baseball
history. Who did they undercut, and
in what year did this team of banjo-
boppers hit for a rousing 247
average?

Scores!?

Now for a change, we will report
I-M scores. In tennis: League A is
headed by Sigma Nu (3-0) which
has defeated Phi Ep (2-1), Kappa
Sig (1-1), Phi Kap (1-2), and Sigma
Chi (0-2). League B looks like the
personal property of SAE (3-0) with
ZBT (2-1), Phi Gam (1-2), and Phi
Psi (0-3) trailing. DU and Phi Delt

Generals Seek Initial Victory;
Take On Centre Here Saturday

The Washington and Lee Generals
will seek their initial victory of
the young season against Centre to-
morrow on the W&L gridiron. After
back to back defeats at the hands |
of Randolph-Macon and Hampden-
Sydney, the incentive is high to re-
bound against the hard hitting
Centre eleven.

Centre, with a record to date of |
2-0-1, comes into the game Satur- |
day with an impressive win over
Southwestern last week, 10-9. Out-|
weighed at all the line positions, the |
Centre

team hit harder and em-
ployed a “blitz” defense to offset |
the power of Southwestern. To!

linebackers and, on some occasions,
their free safety man. Tom Young,
a senior tackle who plays both ways,
will anchor the line, which makes
up in determination what it lacks in
size.

The Generals have made some
basic changes in their win-T offense
to combat the blitzing linebackers
of Centre and to “open up” their
attack to score. You will probably
Larry Craig throwing more
short passes over the middle to the,
which the linebackers have |
vacated. Since the opposition will |
frequently use this type of defense, |
Craig will stick mainly to the short
“button-hook” and “look-in” pat-
terns. Hampered in the H-S game
by a sore arm which affected his
long passes, Craig will seldom have
time to throw the “bomb,” and
thus can concentrate on the short
passing attack. There have been a
few slight alterations in the running
game, due primarily to numerous
injuries in the backfield. With the
loss of first string halfbacks Mike
Bear and Rudd Smith, and injuries
to Billy Andrews and Larry Craig,
Coach Lee McLaughlin will go with
such experienced men as Bob Mil-
ler and John Anthony, but also with

inexperienuce in the persons of John
Bogart and Buddy Atkins, a terror
at 132 pounds. Bogart, playing his
first varsity game last week at H-S,
was very impressive and should see
considerable action against Centre.
Since all of these backs are small
and fast, you may see a lot of sweeps

| to offset the aggressive and hard hit-

ting line of Centre.

With the loss of Warren Stewart
and Rob Reading at the two end
spots, Craig will be throwing to two
new receivers. However, the rest of
the line appears to be in fine shape
and should give the Centre line a
good battle. Not lacking in size, the
scrappy Generals can look ahead to
some rough football and fierce
blocking.

The Centre offensive attack relies
mainly on their outstanding quart-
erback, Jim LaMonica. He is a mas-
ter of the “rollout” run or pass
option, often using the “bootleg”
method of concealing the ball, Also
they have a talented back in Tom
Boone who should add to their var-
ied attack. The Generals will have
to contain Boone and LaMonica and
the end sweps and rollouts in or-
der to halt their offense. However,
the major problem for the generals
will be to move against the stout
Centre defense, which held the high
scoring Southwestern to a mere nine

 

points.

Noting a few sidelights about last
week’s game and tomorrow’s, Coach
McLaughlin mentioned he was im-
pressed with the all-around play of
guard Logan Bullitt on defense. If
the aggressiveness of the line play
continues to increase the W&L backs
will find more opportunity in the
future to turn on the speed, es-
pecially Buddy Atkins. Coach Mc-
Laughlin noted that without the
services of two first string halfbacks
and the injury to Billy Andrews, he
will be playing a very inexperienced
backfield, but personnel with a great
deal of potential. One last note: the
first points the Generals score to-
morrow will be the first of the year,
so let’s see them go right from the
opening kickoff. What do you say we
go in force and cheer them on to
victory.

For the most part such issues don’t
exist in Los Angeles and Chicago.
These riots were indications of wide-
spread economic dissatisfaction. One
might go so far as to call them
proletarian uprisings.

These riots give evidence to a very
serious problem which the leaders of
most of the great northern cities
have been doing their best to solve
for some time. The War on Poverty
is aimed at situations like these,
though only time will tell if it is
going to be effective enough to solve
this problem. It will most likely be
a long, slow process, making very
limited progress on a small scale.

This problem has by no means
been helped by the “great crusades”
that Dr. Martin Luther King has
been leading in many northern cities.
This past summer, I witnesed first
hand Dr. King’s crusade in Chicago.
Mayor Daley offered several times
to meet with Dr. King and discuss
Chicago's racial problems, but Dr.
King refused. Instead, he chose to
lead a large demonstration in Chica-
go while the mayor was out of town
on official busines. Dr. King led ten
thousand in a march on city hall
and there announced that Chicago
was no “Jerusalem on the shores of
Lake Michigan” (certainly no sur-
prise to anyone who has ever been
there). Nothing in the way of con-
structive achievements is wrought
by these demonstrations in the
streets. They are harmful disruptions
to say the least. However, we can
probably expect a god bit more of
this in the future.

Strange as it may sound at this
time, there is, I think, a good bit of
hope for racial harmony, peace, and
order in the not so distant future
in the South, but no such hope in
the North. It may well be that the
agony of Selma is near its end, but
that of Watts has only just begun.
