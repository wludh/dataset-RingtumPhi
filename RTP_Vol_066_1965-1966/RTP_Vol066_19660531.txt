At the last regular meeting of
the Dance Board, the newly-elected
members and president-elect Tom
Cox voted approval for several in-
novations in the Dance Board pro-
gram for next year.

Most significant of the new chang-
es increases the cost of the dance
plan from $30 to $35.

Cox noted that although this might
seem extravagant at first, the rising
cost of entertainment and the gen-
eral trend of inflation has necessi-
tated this increase if the Board can
continue to contract the same calibre

‘Want to visit Russia?”

 

Capito Attends Russian Youth Camp |

When Washington and Lee’s stu-
dents seatter in a hundred directions
with the close of school one will head
for a Russian Youth Camp.

Howard Capito, a sophomore from
Charleston, W. Va., will spend sev-
eral days at the camp as part of a
three-week tour of the Soviet Union
and some of its satellite countries.

Study in Munich

Capito, along with 40 other col-
lege students from the US. and
Canada, will study this summer in
Munich, Germany, in the Soviet
Area and Language Session spon-
sored by the University of Oklaho-
ma in cooperation with the Institute
for the Study of the USSR.

After the six-weeks course at
Munich, Capito and his fellow stu-
dents will tour Russia, Czechoslo-

 

vakia, Poland and East and West

| Berlin.

At Kiev, in the Soviet Union, they
will stay at the youth camp.

“I don’t know much about the
camp except that we will be joined
by a group of Soviet students on
our tour, and they will be with us at
the camp,” Capito said. “I expect
on our tour we will see only what
the Russians want us to see.”

Other stops on the tour include
Leningrad, Prague and Warsaw.

History and Literature

The Soviet Studies program offers
courses in Soviet literature, history
and language as well as opportuni-
ties for research and advanced area
study. Although scholarships for the
program are available, Capito is one
of those paying his own way.

CONTACT Narrows 1967 Topic
And Requests Tax-Free Status

CONTACT for 1967, under the di-
rection of Stafford W. Keegin, Law
School ’68, Chairman, and W. Law-
rence Fellman, ’67, Assistant Chair-
man, will examine some of the rev-
olutionary forces caused by the ris-
ing expectations and discontinuity
produced by a new affluency wit-
ness not only by the citizens of the
United States, but the world com-
munity as well.

The scope of the program will be
broad bringing into focus some of
the new hopes and the disintergra-
tion of old patterns in the churches,
education and the college campus,
public morality, politics, both do-
mestic and foreign, the arts and the
business community.

The first business of the new CON-
TACT Committee, however, was far
more basic than the determination

 

cause the students are the sponsors
of the program and, of course, no
admission is charged for partici-
pation in the seminar lectures, and
because the CONTACT program for
1966 failed to break even financially,
the committee set out to revamp its
internal structure in order to be in
compliance with the Internal Rev-
enue Code on non-profit associa-
tions thereby making all contribu-
tions by interested parties tax de-
ductible.

While the committee has not, as of
this writing received a ruling from
IRS, they do not anticipate difficulty
in this regard. Because of the over-
whelming support of CONTACT on
the campus and off, the committee
is confident that the financial diffi-
culties it now faces can be over-
come and that CONTACT for 1967
will be as exciting an intellectual

of a topic for the 1967 program. Be- | experience as it has been in the past.

Johnson, Andrews Top Athletes;
Awards and Barbecue End Year

Ira L. Johnson and William D. An-
drews received Washington and Lee
University’s top two athletic awards
last week at the school’s annual
sports awards barbecue.

Johnson, a senior from Louisville,
Ky., was presented the Wink Glas-
gow Spirit and Sportsmanship
Award, given to the athlete who has
demonstrated the highest qualities of
W&L spirit and sportsmanship
throughout his college career.

Billy Andrews

Andrews, a senior from Salem, was
named the most valuable athlete.
The award is presented for perform-
ance and proficiency in W&L athlet-
ics.

Johnson has been a member of the
Generals’ cross-country team three
years and the track squad four
years and has earned a total of sev-
en monograms during that span. He
co-captained each sport this past
year.

In addition, he set a new W&L
cross-country record this past fall,
covering the 4.1 mile-long course
in 23:40.

Andrews, a defensive halfback in
football and mid-fielder in lacrosse,
has been a three-year letterman on
