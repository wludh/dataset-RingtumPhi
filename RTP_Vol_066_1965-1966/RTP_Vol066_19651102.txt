Tuesday Edition

Library Report Unavatlable

Once again the crusading efforts of the Ring-tum Phi have
been thwarted by the omnipotent bureaucratic hierarchy of
Washington and Lee. Last week we made reference to an ob-
scure but relatively harmless report dealing with our library
and its resources. Since that time we have been unable to ob-
tain a copy of the report for publication. Both the chairman
of the Library Committee, Dr. Allen W. Moger, and the chair-
man of the English Department, Dr. Severn Duvall, from
whose department the report originated refused to “promote
its general circulation at this time.”

At the risk of sounding repetitive, we feel a brief explana-
tion of the report and its origin is in order. The survey was
conducted by two members of the English Department who
were concerned with certain gaps in the library in the field
of English. Thus, a questionnaire dealing with such items as
the ratio of books to students and budgetary allocations was
formulated and sent to a representative number of institutions
with which Washington and Lee is often compared. Among
these schools were Oberlin, Davidson, Williams, Amherst, and
Trinity.

The conclusion which the report contained was that Wash-
ington and Lee must increase its spending significantly in this
area if it intends to maintain its academic reputation. Admit-
tedly, this was not the first time that such a discovery had been
announced, and yet it was regarded as an insult to the foresight
and sound judgment of the Library Committee. Quite obvious-
ly, this was not the intention of those responsible for the survey,
although it was in this spirit that the report was received.

 

After a fairly extensive investigation of the entire matter,
certain facts have come to light which deserve further com-
ment. In the first place the whole issue has unfortunately be-
come infused with personality conflicts. It is somewhat appalling
that sincere concern for library facilities has been attacked on
an ad hominem basis. The issues and not personalities should
be the subject of any enlightened discussion within the aca-
demic community, whether it pertains to the library, or the
curriculum, or whatever.

The manner in which the Library Committee dealt with the
report from the beginning indicates a break down of communi-
cations and a lack of mutual respect. Since the report was pre-
pared by two “freshmen” faculty members it was regarded as
somewhat presumptuous and naive by more experienced mem-
bers of the faculty. Perhaps this accounts for the fact that, al-
though the report was submitted last fall, action by the Library
Committee was delayed until last spring. At this time a copy of
it was circulated to each member of the committee. Discus-
sion of the report never took place, and the final report of the
Library Committee submitted to the Self-Study Committee
did not respond to the report at all.

Early this fall a member of the Library Committee who was
unavoidably absent from the spring meetings and who was
particularly concerned with the omission of the report from the
final recommendations of the committee, addressed a letter to
the chairman in which he expressed the desire to reopen the
hearings on the entire matter. On the basis of this communica-
tion and the recommendations of the self-study analysts, the
Library Committee decided to study the report in a session later
this fall.

At this time the Library Committee still has not acted on
the report, but it is scheduled for discussion early this month.
We fail to understand why criticism which is informative and
constructive has been the object of scorn and ridicule. The in-
tent of the report was not to indict or expose, but simply to
contribute to the over-all evaluation of the library, The events
surrounding this whole incident have certainly inhibited the
natural spontaneity of the self-study, and at the same time
alienated the younger wing of the faculty.

We deplore the seeming inability of certain elements of the
faculty to maintain an open dialogue on the relative merits of
this or any similar report without allowing personal antagon-
isms to cloud the issue. In the light of recent publicity we feel
sure that the report will be given an adequate hearing, but, un-
fortunately, the price may be a permanent split in the Library
Committee. It is, indeed, a sad commentary on our faculty if
this incident can in any sense be described as characteristic of
our institution

s Arguments As Unrealistic

Saunders Opposes Abolition of Saturday Classes

By STEVE SAUNDERS

Most arguments against Saturday
classes don’t merely deteriorate af-
ter intensive examination—they dis-
integrate. It is a rare and artless
brand of sophistry which character-
izes most of the proposas to eliminate
Saturday classes. The lack of ration-
al reasons for abolition, other than
vague appeals for “research time”
(i.e. extended road trips), make the
current dialogue not only unproduc-
tive, but downright ludicrous. We
must look deeper than rationalizing
platitudes.

With the EC poll on the subject
of Saturday classes scheduled for
next Wednesday, it is now more ap-
propriate than ever to intensively
examine the case against Saturday
classes—and watch it disintegrate.

The first impulse on the part of
anyone who has ever started the
weekend too soon and too fast and
and been made to endure the
cruel, throbbing consequences of
an early morning Saturday class, is
to wote for abolition (more than
ones if possible), This rather basic
reaction might make the vote
agaimst Saturday classes almost
unanimous, It is because of this

¥

 

SATURDA
MoRMINGS..--

common prejudice that we are ob-
ligated to at least attempt a dis-
passionate view of the of the prob-
lem.

Those justifications for abolition
revolving around sympathetic treat-
ment of students who want to take
more long road trips but don’t have
enough cuts, are sheer nonsense and
must be discounted. Likewise, the
arguments favoring a “full week-
end” and “more feedom” don’t hold
water,

The problem of athletes missing
classes is valid, and abolition would
solve it. However, increased attend-
ance at athletic events because of
no Saturday classes is both invalid
and unlikely. Students who don’t
support their team now are not going
to start attending if Saturday classes
are abolished. By the same token,
I doubt if anyone is going to travel
to see away games if Saturday morn-
ings are free.

Similarly, the abolition of week-
end classes will neither gain nor
lose prospective W&L applicants.
Most students don’t worry about
Saturday classes until they get here;

 

One argument has at least the
veneer of legitimacy: additional
time for faculty and student re-
search, But how much time does
this consume, and with what fre-
quency? How often do teachers
and students feel constrained to go
to U.Va. for research? Maybe a
handful, once in a while. Concern-
ed as we are with the greatest
good for the greatest number, this
must also be rejected. Not enough
people have this need to warrant
as great an upheaval as abolition of
Saturday classes would involve,

A tangentia consideration is the
disinclination of many professors to
lecture on Saturday; it is an adverse
working condition to many. But this
is for the faculty itself to determine,
not the student body.

 

What would be some of the side-
effects of a 5-day week? Among |
them, almost surely, would be
professorial tendency to assign more |
work over the weekend, because of |
the additional time available to the |
student. More research paper would |

Schedule conflicts would be le-

of the reasons we have a 6-day

use of campus academic facilities,
In the foreseeable future, therefore,
a new and expensive program will
be required. The huge expense,
too large to be handled by the
University’s present endowment,
would in turn raise tuition fees.
Abolition of Saturday classes might
lose the University prospective
students in this case, rather than
encourage them.

Many have in the past pointed to
the example of Randolph-Macon as
a prime example of the practicability
and desirability of a shortened
week. However, these pro-

be

| ponents of abolition usually neglect

to mention that the Randolph-Macon
girls have a four-day week leaving
Wednesday free as a “reading day.”
If abolition were achieved, uneven

| distribution of classes—and the load

of class-work—would eliminate all
similarities in spirit and effect to the
Randoph-Macon system.
Alternatives to Saturday classes
have been suggested. Among these
are plans for 90-minute classes on
‘Tuesday and Thursday, thus distrib-
uting the time usually spent on
Saturday classes. This would create
problems of student sleeping, dood-
ling, and paralysis during these mar-

'athon classes. Lethargy would be-

come part of every class syllabus.
Also, teachers would hard put to
organize two sets of lecture notes for
each course. Other possible substi-

| tutes include two-hour credit cours-

es, accompanied by a complete over-
haul of the present grading, sched-

uling, and credit systems; and,
afternoon classes.
A reasonable compromise would

Student Body
Is Responsible

By BOB LEE

In Friday's Ring-tum Phi, an edi-
torial lamenting the passing from
the Washington and Lee campus of
the great issue-makers Messrs.
Harrington, Lamb and Smith. What
the editorial was in fact grieving was
the “oppressive” absence of legiti-
mate debate and protest at Washing-
ton and Lee.

It seems that there is no great
cause with which the typical stu-
dent might identify himself and
through which he might assert his
self-identity. But isn't there a par-
adox implicit in thse lamentations?
Why should we be disturbed by
the absence of debate? Doesn't the
very absence of debate presuppose
the elimination and resolution of
injustice and conflict? And doesn't
this imply that Washington and
Lee is a veritable utopia, whose
every aspect is above reproach,
of this is nonsense. But
how explain the almost
complete absence of controversy at
Washington and Lee? Does the fault
lie with those most specifically re-
sponsible for stimulating public dis-
cussion and or does it lie
with an indifferent and “diffident”
student body? I imagine that blame
must be attributed to both.

The columnist cannot invent or
draw attention to existing sources
of conflict, But there are numer-
ous areas of potential debate, not
the least of which is conventional
dress. Unfortunately, however, the

Yards; Baker Scores
Led by the hard running of soph-
omore fullback Bill Me David, Wash-
ington and Lee turned a close foot-
ball game into a rout in the second
half as they rolled over Bridgewater,
41-13, on the loser’s field.
Bridgewater put the first points
on the scoreboard when Eagle Ron
Glascow plunged 1 yard for the
touchdown. Myers’ placement made
it 7-0. But Washington and Lee came
back to score two touchdowns before
the half, one on a four yard run by
John Anthony and the second on a
13 yard run by McDavid to take
a 12-7 lead at the halfway point.
W&L took the second half kickoff
and marched to the Eagles 33 yard
line where they were halted and had
to settle for a 43 yard field goal by
Skip Jacobsen to up the score 15-7,
On the following kickoff the home
crowd was brought to its feet
Terry Westhafer raced 87 yards
down the sidelines to close the gap
to 15-13. The Eagles bid for a two
point conversion was thwarted, and
W&L’s lead was preserved.
Bloom to Reading
It was then that the roof fell in on
Bridgewater for on the ensuing kick-
off the Eagles fumbled and W&L
recovered. Andy Bloom, taking full
advantage of this miseue, lofted a
pass good for 20 yards to Rob Read-
ing to increase W&L’s lead by six
points. Jacobsen added the extra
point, and the score became 22-7,
Once again W&L kicked off and true
to form Bridgewater fumbled the
ball the Generals. Bloom, once
again took to the airways and hit
Tersh Baker with a 30 yard pass to}
push the score to 29-7 with the extra |
point. And the fourth quarter was!

when Eagle passer had the ball jar- |

the score. Barclay said that he had

Kirkpatrick for his crowd pleasing

Vietnam Situation Analyzed

(Continued from page 2)
ingful commentary on the Vietnam
situation that I have found. History
and fate have put the United States
in Vietnam. If the U.S. had foreseen
its present position when its first
commitments were being considered,
our policy may well have been dif-
ferent. The temptation to ignore our
presence in Vietnam is evident in
every cry for withdrawal. But this
opportunity is not to be had. It is
effectively impossible for the U.S. to
withdraw at this stage of the war.

The US. claims to be fighting in
behalf of the Vietnamese people
whose “government” has requested
our aid. Vietnam has had so many
governing regimes that the people
probably don’t know who their gov-
ernment is. It is also doubtful that
the Vietnamese regime would stand
were it not for our soldiers, not to
speak of our aid money and weap-
ons. Even if a truce is achieved, there

is no guarantee of stable govern-
ment in Vietnam.
There is danger that the United

States will begin to believe the myths
it ereates to conceal the truth with
the result that no truth can be

it is, and not in the terms of sugar- |

We cannot afford to be misled; es
pecially not by ourselves. It would
be so easy just to vote for abolition |
next Wednesday. But do not forget
that it was just as easy to vote “Ja”

in its Asian policy? Do the Vietna-
mese people want democratic gov-
ernment, and would it really be best
for them? The USS. is trying to halt
the advance of communism in the
Far East. We see the communist
advance as a threat to our security.
But can the United States be a suc-
cessful policeman in the world if it
ignores the truths mentioned above?
The march of event appears to be
stronger than any nation.

The problem in Vietnam is not
whether we should or should not
be there, The issue is what policy
are we to follow to bring the war
to a close? Do we maintain, in-
crease or decrease our commit-
ment, and more important, what
will we do at the conference table?
What are our real objectives in
Vietnam, and what will we settle
for?

These are the real issues, and they
must be decided well; for the world
becomes less and less our own back
yard the greater our wisdom must
be if we are to survive.

aged to win one game. It must have

been against their equally inept
freshman team. As long as we are
playing non-subsidized ball at Wash-
ington and Lee, why not play decent
football teams. It is hard enough to
get excited playing schools no one
has ever heard about. Since every-
thing most have ever heard about
Bridgewater football was bad (this
or any other year), why do we sche-
dule this team. A win over Bridge-
water is like beating Lexington High
School’s freshman team. Why not
drop them from the schedule at the
earliest possible time?

Coming up are two games which
are very easy to get excited about
Sewanee and Washington. The Se-
wanee of 1965 is not the Sewanee of
1964. They have lost two games.
However, they should not be under-
rated. They will certainly be out to
avenge last year’s upset loss to W&L.
Like the Generals, Sewanee plays
a ground ball game. They are not
big. On paper it looks like a toss-
up, unless MecLaughlin’s Generals
revert to their lackluster perfor-
mance of the first three games. Spirit
will win this game.

The last game is a bit different.
Washington is a better football team
than we are. Fast backs, mean line-
men, and extra big, extra fleet ends
abound on this team. The Bears
have only one loss and are sporting
a small college national ranking. Two
fine throwing quarterbacks spear-
head the best passing attack the
Generals will face this year. The
ends are exceptional, a second string
end runs a quick 9.7 100-yard dash.

In view of the spotty record of
W&L’s defense, it looks like a mas-
sacre. But so did Sewanee in '64 and
Guilford in ’65.

Since Washington and Sewanee
are gradually becoming our chief
rivals, it seems a shame that every
other year the fans are deprived of
seeing either of them. Hopefully in
the future someone will have the
foresight to schedule those games so
that each year we can see one of
these games.

Assimilation Policies

the fact that these standards would
be strictly enforced on the Hill dur-
ing class hours; according to the
Executive Committee this applies for

the town of Lexington as well.
Another significant purpose of
these talks was to explain that con-
ventional dress is a unifying factor at
W&L which distinguishes it from
many other colleges, and that it
does not represent an effort to make
everyone look “preppy.’ The Assim-
ilation Committee feels, much to the
contrary, that it adds to the charac-
ter of the student and places him on
“closer level to the teacher.”

“And what conclusions can we
draw from the study we have made?
It is evident from what we have set
above, as well as from the
source material itself, that we must
not be too hasty to condemn those
who have not agreed fully with the
assessments of the facts, since these
dissenting opinions can have value in
shedding more light on lesser known
aspects.

“We agree, then, that the main
problem is central, and that we are
indebted to those scholars who have
unearthed the material with which
we have been working. It is evident
that our study has pointed up the
importance of these facts and their
relevance to our lives as young men
in 1965.”
