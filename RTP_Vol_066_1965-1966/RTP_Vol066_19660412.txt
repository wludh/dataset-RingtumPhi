Final Collegian
To Be Issued
After Springs

Spectacular Colors And
Additional Pages
Signal End

Due to the recent controversy and
uncertainty of the Southern Col-
legian’s future, and because this will
be the final issue and “the best
ever,” the Collegian will not come
out until the week after Springs,
Editor Jim Crothers said today.

“We could have appeared at
Springs,” Crothers said, “but we
wanted to make this last issue a real
collectors item.”

Some of the additional features
the extra week will allow include
eight extra pages and a fold-out
section similar to Playboy’s. The
Collegian will also feature a lot of
color both on the cover, and inside,
and lots of colorful written material.

“This will be the most profession-
ally done magazine ever connected
with Washington and Lee,” the editor
predicted. A new type of printing
process permits the Collegian these
new alterations.

The theme will be, appropriately,
“Hairy Collegian is dead.” This,
along with several satirical articles
about the “Hill” show clearly the
staff's unhappiness at the recent
faculty decision to withhold money
from the Collegian next year.

The staff got together, Crothers
said, and “decided to put out one
good, big issue as a final parting
shot,” rather than two regular is-
sues. “We thought after a Spring's
edition, a Final’s issue would be
anti-climatic,” he said. Therefore,
this April 22 edition will be the last
ever to appear at Washington and
Lee unless the faculty reconsiders
or if it is published privately.

1967 Steering Committee

The Steering Committee of CON-
TACT 1967 was announced today by
the program’s Chairman, Stafford
W. Keegin. After personal interviews
with many applicants, Keegin and
his Vice-Chairman, Larry Fellman,
made the following selections: Jack

Hopkins, Phi Kappa Alpha; John
Graham, Delta Tau Delta; Roger
Wallace, Independent Union; Howie

Epstein, Zeta Beta Tau; and Rick

Somon, Zeta Beta Tau.

Keegin noted in making the an-
nouncement that there has not been
any definite assignment of responsi-
bilities to the new committee mem-
bers. He added, however, “Such as-
signments should be of no difficulty,
for each of these men appears to be
capable of handling any phase of the
program with imagination and skill.”

“I am extremely pleased,” Keegin
went on to say, “that these gentle-

 

|men have

volunteered to serve on
the committee, and I am confident
that together we will be able to put
together a program that will be stim-
ulaing to every member o fthe stu-
dent body.”

Fellman, in expressing his appre-
ciation of the appointees’ willingness
to join the committee, said, “The
committee as a whole will have the
vitality and enthusiasm that each of
these men has displayed in his cam-
pus activities to date. I am certain
that we will be able to make CON-
TACT 1967 an intellectually exciting
experience.”

The first meeting of the committee

will be Thursday, April 14, at 7:30

in the Student Union. The nature
of the meeting will be a discusion
of basic committee organization,

financial support, and a topic for the
program.

‘Best Delegate’
At Mock UN

Two W&L students participated in
the Second Annual Hollins College
Model United Nations Security
Council this past weekend. Fred
Mindel and Steve Saunders repre-
sented the United Kingdom. At the
conclusion of the session on Satur-
day, Saunders was named “Best
Delegate” of the Council.

All of the Fulbright Scholars at
Washington and Lee attended the
sessions, as did several other inter-
ested students.

Agenda

The agenda included Viet Nam,
Southern Rhodesia, and the Domi-
niacn Republic. Nineteen colleges in
the South and East took part, includ-
ing Yale, Princeton, University of
North Carolina, VMI, VPI, and Duke
University.

Colin Wilson, First Secretary of
the British Embassy in Washington,
addressed the delegates on Thursday
night. Lord Caradon, U.K. Ambas-
sador to the U.N., was originally
scheduled as the speaker, but was
called home to London at the last
minute for instructions on the Rho-
desia crisis.

Heavy Preparation

The award for “Best Delegation”
went to Mali. The University of
North Carolina, representing the So-
viet Union won the award last year.

Preparation involved over sixty
hours of research, according to
Mindel and Saunders, including sev-
eral trips to the United Nations
headquarters in New York and the

 

British United Nations Mission.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Tuesday Edition

An Unrivaled Opportunity

The Independent Study Plan has been passed 7-1 by the
Executive Committee, after receipt of the report by the special
committee headed by Junior Jim Awad. Basically, the plan
involves ending the Fall semester in December, and devoting
most of January to independent preparation of individual
study papers. Subjects for the papers would be selected by
each student, the details being worked out with his faculty
adviser. Students could leave Lexington during this period,
for purposes of research.

Here lies the main point of contention: Will students
abuse this month-long, restriction-free period? This is in the
back of everyone’s mind. There are other considerations, such
as rescheduling of sports events and Fancy Dress, and the fi-
nancial strain some students will face traveling away from Lex-
ington for research. However, this question of the student body
entering into the spirit of the program is paramount.

At Colgate, the plan is now in its second year, and the col-
lege intends to continue it. To be sure, there were the slackers,
those who saw the independent study period as a month-long
extension of the Christmas recess. However, these were the
insouciant fringe present on every campus. The overwhelming
majority of Colgate’s students turned in creditable work. Few
received ‘Honors’ ratings, but the work of still fewer was
graded “Unsatisfactory.”

To some W&L students, the proposed Independent Study
Plan may look like a free ticket to New York or Washington.
But to many others, we believe, it will represent an unrivaled
opportunity for the creative and stimulating academic ex-
perience so urgently needed at Washington and Lee.

It will not be easy. Semester-long courses will have to be
compressed, and a heavy burden will be placed on every stu-
dent. But still we feel that it would be worth it. We look
forward with eagerness to the comments and action of the
Faculty, and hope that they will not let this opportunity pass
us by unnoticed.

That Time Of Year

It’s that time of year again. Along with the magnolia and
cherry blossoms, a whole crop of smiling, well-scrubbed can-
didates have suddenly bloomed. But this is as it should be, and
we shall comment no further.

However, what does disturb us are the sounds one hears
from some quarters about Washington and Lee’s need to re-
turn to the tried-and-true vehicle of the political party. These
perennial grumblers complain about the large number of candi-
dates filing for office, and the resultant confusion every voter
faces. Is it not much simpler, they ask, to have the eliminations
done privately at a party caucus, rather than subject the Stu-
dent Body to the inconvenience of a primary? They hastily
add that it is also unfair to the candidates, who are supposedly
indistinguishable, one from the other, because of the large
number in the running.

We answer these grumblers as we did last year: the sys-
tem works, and works well. The lack-luster candidate that can-
not stand out among many could not be made to shine if op-
posed by only one. If he is as good as his backers say, he'll
come out of the primary on the ticket. And finally, if the
Student Body feels it inconvenient to vote in a primary which
we dispute, it will be just as indisposed to vote in the general
election: Over 1000 students voted in the “Big Four” election
last year.

Let these grumblers go on grumbling; they do no harm.
Two freshman classes have grown up without the dubious com-
fort of political cliques, and it is unlikely that we shall go back.
There is a responsible case to be made for political parties but
no proposal has yet come forward which can offer the guaran-
tee of democratic freedom of choice provided by the primary
system.

The candidates are smiling, getting around, and campaign-
ing hard. There are a goodly number of them and it will be a
hard choice. But this is as it should be, and we shall comment
no further.

Those Magnificient Men

As the W&L Self-Study Program nears its conclusion, it
seems only fitting to extend our appreciation and thanks to

 

 

those faculty members who gave of their time and energy
as analysts in the several sections of the report. They patiently
answered student questions, attended endless meetings, and
then correlated the whole mass of material into a coherent
and meaningful report. Often maligned, misunderstood, mis-
quoted, and sometimes mistaken, these men did yeoman
service. They have our thanks.

Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained

 

By BRUCE W. RIDER
“Something there is that doesn’t love
a beard,

That wants it off”

(From the beloved poem,
Faces Make Good Students.)

Not many moons ago I awoke in
the dead of night gripped with fear.
Gradually, with
out quite being
aware of it, I had
become a Wash-
ington and Lee
man. (Not the
W&L man of the
University Cata-
logue but the real
kind we have
wending their way
about the cam-
pus).

It had happened
had happened so subtly that I never
knew when I had crossed over into
Washington and Leemanship. Now I
spoke, looked, studied, did every-
thing like everybody else. Was it
too late? In a desperate attempt to
escape my fate I began to grow a
beard. Not a great hairy all-over
one, Just a goatee. It might be my
last chance.

By JOE FRAMPTOM

I do not favor rush being held at
the beginning of the first semester as
is currently the case. I feel that a
good case can be made in support
of rush during the opening weeks
of the second semester, or perhaps at
the end of the first semester. If the
suggestion for a period of indepen-
dent study during the month of
January is adopted, it would seem
that those four weeks would present
an ideal opportunity for a more
leisurely and meaningful rush period

With a beard I no longer looked
like a W&L man, but could I break
away from other patterns the Uni-
versity had tried to set for me in
the Four Year Plan?

Would I be lost if I had to meet
someone and not have to ask him
“What house are you in?” Could I
ever think that there might even
be something more important that
coats and ties?

Professorial Truth. To say what was
really on my mind and to keep away
from the glib smoothness I'd been
trained to speak.

But it was no use. W&L is no
place to be different. The closer you
fit the groove the more it will be
smooth. Dress cutely, stamp out dif-
ference and change. Get all you can
for old Number One.

Yes, gentle reader, the beard was
shaved off. Why fight our great
system. I’m going back to writing
tests and papers that would make
any professor’s heart beat faster,
knowing that this young lad has
finally come to the Truth.

I had learned my lesson all too
well. It would be hard to turn over
a new coat and tie at this late hour.
I had learned to play the Academic
Game of handing back to the profes-
sor his own gems of wisdom rather
than setting forth my own ideas.
After all, who am I, a mere student,
to know anything on my own? And
why take the trouble? Yet... could
I break away from this game to try
honestly to learn for myself?

We wear coats and ties and act
sophisticatedly and keep aloof from
the common rabble. We are Washing-
ton and Lee men. We are a damn
sight better than anybody else. We're
stronger, more handsome, smarter
than the rest of the world. And we
deserve to be.

I'm glad I'm back in the fold. It’s
much too painful to strike out on
your own.

At Washington and Lee we strive
for for the Golden Mean. We are
golden. We are mean.

Could I ever learn again not to
think in stereotypes? Not to laugh
at and hate people and things dif-
ferent from the glorious perfection
of Washington and Lee?

For a while I tried to be honest.

Graduate Advocates Dress
Traditions As A Great Gift
To The Present Generation

To the Editor:

I read with some dismay in the
fall issue of the Alumni Magazine of
the erosion of the time honored tra-
dition of conventional dress in the
spring of 1965. I also had occasion
to read President Cole’s challenge to
the student body in his address at
the University assembly at the be-
ginning of this school year, and I
understood your response to that
challenge was most gratifying,

I hope that the tradition of con-
ventional dress, begun long ago, suf-
fers no further erosion in the warm
months of this spring.

Who does the tradition belong to?
Just to you, the members of the
present student body, or also to the
long line of Washington and Lee
men who have preceded you at the
University? Those that have gone
before you have sustained with pride
and dignity the tradition of con-
ventional dress and we will not sit
idly by while you destroy it.

We have just as much an interest
in the preservation of values and at-
titudes at Washington and Lee as
you do, the present generation of
students. Washington and Lee be-
longs to us all!

Briggs Besitens
E. C. Activities
This Past Year

By WARD BRIGGS

Having followed the actions of the
EC this year, I have been pleased
with its achievements but slightly

disappointed that

the changes which

are so vitally

needed have not
% had the necessary
time in which to
be properly effect-
ed. This past year
has been crucial to
the maintenance of
the University’s
position amongst
other schools, but
next year will
prove to be decisive.

 

This is a time for examination of
the traditions which have formed
the foundations of our school’s repu-
tation. We must examine whether
or not change is necessary in sev-
eral areas.

Rush Week

I feel Rush Week should be con-
ducted under much the same lines
as it is now, but the deadline for
pledging should be considerably ex-
tended. Rush Week should be a time
for acquaintance with the fraternity
and acknowledgement of any interest
the freshman might have. But the
number of people who de-pledge or
who eventually drop out of a house
would show that the system is too
accelerated; that freshmen are too
immediately pressed to do fraternity
work to become acquainted with

Action-filled Game

Coach Carroll Klingelhofer made a
successful debut as mentor of the
lacrosse “B” squad Friday, as his
charges defeated Augusta Military
Academy 9-8 at Wilson Field.

Washington and Lee battled back
from a 4-1 deficit in the first quar-
ter to knot the score 5-5 at half
time. Three straight goals at the
opening of the second half shot the
Generals into lead which they
never relinquished

Augusta closed out with a flurry,
and closed the gap to one point with
one minute remaining in the game.
W&L kept control for the remainder
and preserved the victory.

Lars Holtan and Howard Capito |

Law Defendant Acquitted
In Annual Mock Trial

After forty (40) minutes of delib-
eration, the jury returned a verdict
of not guilty in the Spring Mock
Trial at the Rockbridge County
Courthouse last Wednesday (Apr. 6).
The proceeding were sponsored by
the law school and afforded an op-
portunity for six student lawyers to
try a simulated criminal case. Mr.
William O. Roberts, Jr., attorney
for the City of Lexington, served as

judge.

The defendant, Joseph Smith, por-
trayed by freshman law student Gus
Biddle, was acquitted of charges that
he robbed the branch office of the
Lexington State Bank last August in
the fictional set of facts. Smith was
previously indicted for the crime on
circumstantial evidence. He was a
teller at the bank and had passed

| Generals’ Baseball Team

By CHARLIE FRERET
The Generals’ baseball

off to a bad start last Friday as

Old Dominion at Norfolk. Pete
assignment and pitched a creditable

ball game. Pete was nicked for 11

extra bases. He struck out five while
walking three.

This was Old Dominion’s eleventh
game and the added experience
clearly showed as the game pro-
gressed. Carlson started on

three hits while giving up three
walks. So effective was he
not until the ninth inning was W&L
able to put two men on base at the
same time.

Old Dominion scored its first run
in the second inning when back-to-
back singles sandwiched around a
balks produced a run after two
outs. Old Dominion then picked up
two more runs in the third and
single runs in the fifth and sixth
innings.

But the run in the second proved
to be all the margin Carlson needed
as he had the General batters hit-
ting to his fielders all day long.
Luke Crosland got W&L’s first hit—
a single in the third. In the fifth,
Eric Sisler lined a double down the
first baseline but was out trying to
reach third base on the hit. W&L’s
last hit came in the seventh—a
single by Dave Kirkpatrick.

Coach Lyles was optimistic after
the game, saying that the boys
played a good ball game and should
have a good season. He cited Old
Dominion as “a good ball club, but
one that had played already ten
games prior to ours.” Coach Lyles
feels that as soon as the boys get the
experience under their belts, the vic-
tories will come.

Georgetown comes to town Tues-
day and the Generals would like
nothing better than to notch that
first win against them. Hampden-
Sydney invades for a Friday game

Six General Trackmen |
Compete at Williamsburg |

Coach Norm Lord sent six Wash-

liamsburg Saturday to compete in
the Colonial Relays. None brought
home against rugged competition that
broke twelve meet records.

Eric Mynttinen, Bill Wildrick, Riff
O'Connor, Jim Thompson, Bob
Stack and Lee Johnson represented
the Generals.

The four mile relay team placed
fourth out of six teams entered.
Running in the event were Co-
captain Thompson, Stack, O’connor,
and Wildrick. Johnson, the other co-
captain, was supposed to run but
dropped out in favor of Wildrick who
was acting as team manager. Johnson
has long been plagued this season
by leg trouble.

Mynttinen threw the javelin 187
feet, approximately the distance that
brought him second place in the
same meet last year. However, it
wasn’t even good enough this year
to be measured. The winner tossed
the javelin 226 feet.

The stiff opposition was furnished
by such track powers as UVa, North

Westchester State, Wake Forest, and
the host school, William and Mary.

Columnist Praises ODK Forum

(Continued from page 2)

Comprised of the most influential
leaders on the campus, the Forum
can provide both an important liaison
between the students and the faculty
and provide an intellectual forum in
which controversial issues such as
NSA and integration plans can be
discussed.

The Forum can also solicit faculty
opinion so that matters of importance
such as the question of having girls
in the dorms, or of subsidizing the
Southern Collegian can be dealt with
jointly by the faculty and students
rather than by one first and then the
other.

Girls in the Dorms

I feel the girls in the dorms mat-
ter was handled poorly by the facul-
ty and that the matter should be
brought up again next year and from
then on, as long as student opinion
favors it. The Southern Collegian is
an institution rather than a tradition
and should be kept alive as the
important literary magazine it once
was, providing a market and accept-
ance of the creative talents of mem-
bers of the student body, talents
which too often are wasted in ob-
livion.

I also feel there should be a read-
ing period of two weeks before ex-
ams in which the student would be
required to read certain books for
each course at his own speed, and
then be responsible for them on
the exam. This would give more time
for concerted reading and some slight
relaxation before exams.

while maintaining the distinct per-
sonality of our campus. The tradition

enforcement of conventional dress.

A tradition relies solely on the
sincerity of the student body. If
the focus of the students is shifting
to concerns other than those of
dress, it would seem apparent that
the enforcement as well as the tra-
dition must be done away with. If
people make up their minds that
they will assert themselves by dress-
ing sloppily, they must submit to the
consequences; whether it be social
octracization or social probation.

I am personally in favor of the
tradition but not for any enforcement
of it, on the grounds that we must
not allow students to be suspended
or fined for a matter of such indi-
vidual concern.

If it is the feeling of the student
body, however, that conventional
dress be made a rule, the EC must
be ready to accept and enforce the
will of the student body.

Hopefully, it would be a step away

the number of arbitrary blackballs;
hopefully, it would eliminate the

Such a system would not be

The good major wished to pre-

Executive Committeeman Discusses Rush

ized rush parties would eliminate
the great expense of case after case
of beer. Costs of the entire rush
program would be greatly reduced.

A Realistic Solution

I don’t believe that the above sug-
gestion is so unrealistic that it
warrants no consideration. Certainly
there are many details that must be
worked out. Is there any reason
why they can’t be? Unfortunately,
yes! Fraternity men will immediately
say, “We cannot possibly go through
the first semester without the addi-
tional money,” or “What will we
do for pledges to wait on us and
amuse us?”, or “How will freshmen
get down the road?” or “Look how
restricted the freshmen’s social life
will be!” Such men will veto a sec-
ond semester rush program.

There are legitimate objections to
a second semester program but I
question the contention that they
outweigh the favorable factors. I
believe it is time for fraternity men
to make a close reevaluation of the
importance and meaning of rush
week as it now exists. A revampment
of the rush proceedure could in-
ject into the fraternity system a new
purpose and a new direction. Most
of us know that these are needed,
yet most of us also refuse to admit
such a fact, even to ourselves.
