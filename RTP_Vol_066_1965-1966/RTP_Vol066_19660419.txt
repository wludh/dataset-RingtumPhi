Official IFC Nominations
For Elections on Monday

By JOHN LEE

At last night’s IFC meeting, Billy
Cannon presented the Judicial
Board’s nominations for membership
on next year’s Judicial Board, and
additional nominations were tak-
en. The official nominations are, for
President, Ren Manning and Roger
Milam, and for Vice-President, Bar-
ry Vaught.

Three candidates are now running
for Secretary, Kaz Herchold, Mike
Miles, and Jim Kiersky; and for
Treasurer, John Reynolds has been
nominated.

Senior Justice at Large candidate

Jody Luck Tom Baremore,
Ellis Zahre, Barry Crosby, and Bill

ing out the slate is Kaz Herchold,
nominated for Editor of the IFC
Rush Book. Elections will be held

next Monday night.

New Constitution

Copies of the revised IFC Consti-
tution were given to IFC members.
Including the definition of a social
function and rush rules, the Consti-
tution incorporates previous changes
and minor revisions such as, chang-
ing the “Town of Lexington” to the
“City of Lexington.”

The matter of booking for combos
was discussed. Some houses have ex-
pressed dissatisfaction concerning
certain combos who have failed to
arrive for scheduled engagements, as
well as indefinite planning on the
part of booking agents. Ed Allen sug-
gested that in the future, fraterni-
ties should not book any combo
which has failed to arrive more than
once.

IFC Slate

Originally, the slate was to be of-
fered at last Monday’s meeting, and
voted on by the IFC at their meet-
ing last night. However, the IFC
Judicial Board did not receive a
sufficient number of applications and
extended the deadline for applica-
cations. The present was the

slate s
product of that second meeting.

IFC slates of candidates have not
fared well in the past. Last year,
the Judicial Board nominated Geoff
Butler, who was defeated by Chuck
Griffiin, who was nominated from
the floor. The previous year, Brooks
Brown was designated by the Judi-
cial Board, only to be ousted by
Steve Hibbard. An interesting race
is anticipated.

as unopposed, and the Ex

 

ecutive Committee dis-
“allowed the ballots cast for the
write-in candidates on the grounds
that the student body constitution
provided that only persons who had

submitted the required petitions
were eligible for election. The EC
also decided that ballots east for

write-in candidates would be thrown
out and not considered as votes in
the final tally.

Landslides Galore

Kirk Follo defeated Mike Nation
with 78 per cent of the votes, the
biggest victory of the day. Nation
polled only 157 to Follo’s 558. Out of
755 students voting, only 715 voted
in the vice-presidential race.

In the contest for secretary, Billy
Want steamrolled over Bill Grant
with 65 per cent of the votes cast.
Grant received 258 votes, half of
Want’s 488. Seven hundred forty-
six students cast their for
this office.

In a race which had the highest
number of students voting, Ed Al-
len defeated Warren Stewart by a
vote of 471 to 284. Allen piled up
62.5 per cent of the vote.

Write-in candidates for president

pathy on which they were depend-
ing for support. David C. Oliver.

President Fred Mindel expressed
dissatisfaction with the constitution-
11 prohibition of write-in votes: “The
provisions relating to this question
are inadequate and inexplicit. Thers

should be recognition of the write-
in vote in the constitution.”

He was pleased though with th
new oflicers, and said that the newly

elected president and vice-president

hed both been “outstanding” mem-

bers of an xceptional” Executive

A Modest Proposal

As a result of yesterday’s general election, we feel it ap-
propriate to suggest some change in the student body constitu-
tion. Unfortunately, the constitution makes no provision for
write-in candidates since they are not qualified candidates in
the technical sense. According to the wording of the section
concerning elections, a candidate is placed on the ballot only if
he meets certain academic requirements and submits a petition
with one hundred fifty signatures prior to the first Monday
after the spring recess,

In a later paragraph, the constitution indicates that these
candidates must receive a simple majority of the votes cast.
If no candidate receives this required majority, a run-off must
be held for the two candidates with the most votes. There is
not any mention of write-in candidates; probably because the
framers of this lucid document did not anticipate a race with
only one candidate.

 

 

The decision of the Executive Committee not to count
votes of various write-in candidates was based on the limitations
delineated by our constitution. If Mr. Oliver or any other write-
in candidate had received a majority of votes cast, the situation
would have been particularly awkward. Quite obviously, the
EC feels some “moral” obligation to recognize the voice of any
student majority, and yet under our present system the elec-
tion of any write-in candidate would not have been possible.

In order to remedy this inequitable procedure, we propose
a constitutional amendment which would allow write-in candi-
dates in all contests. This special type of candidacy would still
be subject to the academic prerequisites, however, the petition
requirement would be waived. Under this system, the neces-
sary restrictions placed on candidates for student body offices
would be maintained while permitting the electorate some guar-
anteed alternative for each race.

We do believe that petitions serve a valuable and justi-
fable purpose, in that they discourage obviously unqualified
persons, but we also see that absolute adherence to this process
creates problems which are not easily resolved. This proposed
plan would protect the democratic safeguards and advantages
which serve the best interest of the student body. We urge
immediate preparation of a suitable amendment incorporating
these points to be submitted to the student body at the time of
class elections.

 

Challenge Of Spring

Temperatures are rising, the humidity is climbing, and—if
the student body repeats its performance of last spring—coats
will soon disappear, and ties, another perennial victim, will at
best migrate to a seasonal locus about three inches below the
collar. The heat is uncomfortable, and these are the student’s
reactions.

However, we appeal to the student body to make a reason-
able effort to uphold regular standards of conventional dress
during this balmly spring weather. The Executive Committee
has returned discretionary fining power to the Assimilation
Committee, and unless there is a dramatic change from last
year’s experience, a bumper crop of violators will find them-
selves before the committee. Non-appearance when summoned
also carries a fine.

In the fall issue of the Alumni Magazine, an article on the
gradual disappearance of conventional dress featured numer-
ous photographs of students in several abbreviated forms of
traditional attire it was commented that more damage was
done to conventional dress during two months last spring than
had been suffered altogether in the past few years,

The challenge is being offered by the rising mercury, and
students will either have to temper their reactions, or sacrifice
conventional dress. There are better arguments to be made
against the tradition than those of physical discomfort.

A gentleman does not molt in the spring; he does not
shuck his gentlemanly attire with the vernal equinox. We are
confident that the student body is equal to the challenge, and
will at least give the new Assimilation Committee policy a
chance to work.

Columnist Calls Local Police

‘Best East Of Maury River?”

By JAY NEWQUIST

We all know that crime in Lex-
ington is non-existent. Muggings are
inversely proportional in numbers
| to the candlepower of street lights
‘and since this is That Time of Year
| (i.e., Holy Week et al.), we should
j all decide which cheek to turn first.
Even knife fights have no spontane-

ity anymore. After all, that ay.
townie lurking in the alley only
wants to show his new chain

wrapped lovingly around his neck
like a boa constrictor, Liquor sales
are so good down on lower Main
Street that they purchased a new
bathtub, and some brand new cop-
per tubing.

Because of this lack of crime,
policemen have more time to dole out
traffic tickets. Where else but in
Lexington can someone drive
through a stop sign and pay twenty
dollars? The same privilege is a
bargain at $5 a throw in New York
City.

But we cannot begrudge the Lex-
ington megapolis this money. It goes
for important civie improvements. As
a result of the recent repainting of

Rider Looks At Right-Wingers

 

 

By BRUCE W. RIDER

This week, dear readers, we shall
begin a two-part series about peo-
ple. As we all know, people (apart
from the categories of male and
female) come in two sizes: conserva-
tives and liberal. Here at Washington
and Lee University (Lexington, Vir-
ginia 24450) we have one hell of a
lot of the first kind and very few
of the second.
Part first of this fascinating (ho
hum) series will consider the con-
servative man. And the second part,
hopefully to appear next week, will
(you've guessed it already) discus
the liberal man. Are you ready?
A conservative man is. of course,
a man who has something. Therefore,
he wants to conserve what he has.
And he wants to make sure some-
one does not take away that what
he has.
Such a man believes always that
he is right. (Hence conservatives are
ealled ‘right,’ as in ‘right-wing.’)
All of the people who are right are
fellow conservatives. The ones who

 

are left are called ‘leftists,’

 

A Conservative: A Man Who

Has Something To Conserve

The conservative has a great de-
sire to have everyone be just like
he himself is. He is attracted to and
attracts people who think, act, dress,
etc., similarly, and he is not attract-
ed to people or things different from
his conservative self.

After all, it does follow that if the
conservative is right, those who differ
are wrong. And only people who are
right should be entitled to such
things as respect, justice, freedom,
opportunity. Freedom, as every good
conservative knows, means freedom
to be conservative—one never knows
what a liberal might do with his
freedom.

The conservative man feels the
same uneasiness when faced with life
as does any other man. But this is
no reflection upon his proper con-
servative self. He is thus a finger-
pointer, believing that all of the
ills of man are Out There.

“Why can’s people be like me?”
asks the dear conservative. “I'm wel]
educated. 'm wealthy. I'm not ask-
ing anybody's help to get along in
the world. Why can’t people be like

The problem, obviously, is that
nonconservative people are lazy and
greedy. They don’t want to work and
get ahead like good conservatives.
All the trouble in the world is caused
by louts wanting handouts (internal
rhyme).

Many have said that conservatives
oppose change. This is aboslutely un-
true. They would not oppose a
change to more conservatism.

Conservatives have a very quick
reaction to threats from the left.
(This is why they are called ‘reac-
tionaries.’)

The conservative kind of man feels
no responsibility for other people.
He is not hungry, nor ignorant. nor
poor, and it’s certainly not his fault
that other people are. Anyway, hun-
ger and ignorance and poverty are
just ruses used by the clever to
separate the rich from thei: money.
Any conservative in his right mind
knows that.

In our next exciting episode we
shall take a look at the conservative’s
arch-enemy, the liberal.

See you then.

drawn push cars, heavily laden with
the succulent produce native to this
verdant valley. Neither they nor their
horses read stop signs, so where
the line ends, they stop.

Restless Natives

And traffic fines also pay for a
number of advanced rural civiliza-
tions rumored to exist around Lex-
ington. Having dodged taxes for
years, these microcoisms of culture
are believed to be remnant of a great
Incan colonial out-post. The center
of this rich historical treasure land
is Irish Creek. The denizens may be
seen strolling aimlessly through town
in calico gowns (circa 1840), faded
Confederate army trousers, wearing
Buster Brown sneakers, decoreously
adorned with some rather bold An-
glo-Saxon expletives.

Since little traffic other than the
push-cart crowd enters or escapes
Lexington, the police have enrolled
in school again. Tax money has fi-
nanced various pilgrimages to great
places of learning, ineluding John
Dillinger’s birthplace and the Ma
Baker Memorial.

Favorite Spots

Other favorite spots include Aca-
pulco, where hourly tours examine
the exact location where Lana Tur-
ner’s charming young daughter gayly
stabbed Johnny Stompanato, Part
of this segment of the re-training
course involves viewing the film
which immortalized the crime:
“Where Love Has Gone.” It is worth
mentioning that Lana Turner de-
cline a starring role, with thanks.

The Lexington police force is in-
deed the best law enforcement north
of Dallas County, Alabama, and cer-
tainly east of the Mississippi. They
are brave and courageous men, and
they have our thanks. You find that
hard to believe? Then would you
believe the Maury River?

 

 

 

Faulty Equipment Blamed
For Lack of Response

The concert Saturday night with
Chuck Jackson was one of the best
ever seen on this campus. This judg-
ment is based on the way the au-
dience responded to the show. The
fact that he did not allow the faulty
microphones to outwardly bother
him helps to prove his ability as an
entertainer.

However, why should we have to
listen to expensive entertainment
through faulty equipment? It would
not be too much trouble to run a
thorough check on the equipment
the week before a concert. If this is
not standard practice, it should be.
There is no reason for either the
entertainer or the audience to suffer
the inconvience of bad microphones.

Thelonious T. Monk

W&L Drops Its Second
Diamond Encounter, 4-0

By CHARLIE FRERET

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team was dealt its second loss and
whitewash of the season Friday as
they bowed to Hampden-Sydney, 4-
0. Pete Heumann started on the
mound for the Generals. Pete was
touched for five hits but shoddy
play by his teammates caused him to
suffer his second loss. Again also
it was the Generals lack of offense,
the inability to hit, which prevented
them from staging any sort of rally.
Jimmy Cooper and Bill Rasmussen
followed Pete to the mound. “Coop”
yielded one hit in three innings and
“Rass” gave up one hit also in the
inning he pitched.

Hampden-Sydney got on_ the
scoreboard in the third inning. Rob-
ertson, the rival pitcher, led off the
inning with a single to right field.
And when Skip Jacobson let the
ball roll through his legs, Robertson
continued around the bases. The Tig-
ers scored three more in the fifth on

three hits, a ball and an error
These runs proved insignificant as
Robertson was never in danger at

any time during the ball game.

Robertson yielded only two singles,
one to centerfielder Tom Mitchell
and the other to catcher Guy Town-
ley, while striking out eight. Robin-
also led the Tigers at the plate as
he collected two singles and a double,
and scored 2 runs.

Two factors have proved costly to
the Generals in their two games
their poor batting and fielding. The
Generals have collected 5 hits in
56 times at the bat for a team bat-
ting average of .090. Five different
plays have hits for W&L. And the
Generals erractic filding is begin-

Washington and Lee’s tennis team
continued their winning ways, shut-
ting out Lynchburg College yester-
day 9-0 in a match played on the
W&L courts.

Freshman Tommy Rueger led the
way as number one man winning
6-0,6-0. The team now stands 4-0

Dr. Erle Kauffman Speaks
On Principles of Evolution

Last Week In Howe Hall

Yesterday in 206 Howe Hall, Dr.
Erle Kauffman of the Smithsonian
Institution spoke to a filled room on
evolution by natural selection and
how it has affected the rise and
development of animal species, in-
cluding man. Dr. Kauffman illustrat-
ed the principles of evolution by
examples of the development of cer-
tain extinct clams and oysters.

“Even the religious fundamental-
ists must today recognize the fact
of evolution,” remarked Dr. Kauff-
man. Nevertheless, he admitted, he
has in the past been denounced by
clergymen while speaking on evolu-
tion before supposedly intelligent
audiences.

 

 

Lacrosse ‘“‘B” Squad Beats
AMA In Double Overtime

Coach Carroll Klingelhofer’s la-
crosse “B” team defeated Augusta
Military Academy in double over-
time 7-5 at AMA.

The Generals were down one point
in the fourth period when Alan Lee
came up with a clutch goal to tie
the game, 5-5, and sent it into over-
time.

The first overtime was scoreless.
Buddy Atkins on a fine individual
effort made the first score in the
second overtime period. Lars Holtan
put the game on ice on an alert play,
breaking up a clear.

Holtan had scored another goal
earlier in the game. Other Washing-
ton and Lee scoring was produced
by Joe Chadwick with two goals, and
Pete Nowick with one.

Klingelhofer commented that the
team didn’t play as well as in the
last week’s outing with AMA. “We
had our minds too much on Springs.
We controlled the ball most of the
game, but we missed too many
shots.

“We have a tough game with
Roanoke today. These two games
with Roanoke, this and next week’s,
are the key to the season.”

Trackmen Bite The Dust
83-61; Face Elon Next

Washington and Lee’s track team
was shut out of the jumping events
and the relays enroute to a 83'-
6112 defeat at the hands of Roanoke.

Freshman Earl Edwards was a
bright spot in a generally dismal af-
ternoon by copping two firsts, in the
shot put and in the discus.

Track team co-captain Lee John-
son, hampered by injuries for some
time, led Washington and Lee’s only
sweep, winning the two mile run. He
was followed by Generals Corbet
Bryant, Brad Shinkle, and Sean
O'Conner.

In the midst of a large scale re-
building year, the track team faces
Elon College at Wilson Field Thurs-
day. Saturday they travel to North
Carolina to participate in the David-
son Relays.

W&L Scoring

Generals taking first place against
Roanoke were: Javelin, John Myntti-
nen at 174.9; shot put, Edwards,
39-10; pole vault, Lawrence, 11-6;
one mile, Bob Stack, 4:35.0; Discus,
Edwards, 126-9; two mile, Lee John-
son, 10:29.8.

Generals’ Comeback Falls
Short, Stickmen Loose, 6-5

By KIP ARMSTRONG

Before a large and enthusiastic
Spring’s weekend crowd, the General
stickmen played an exciting game
Saturday, but dropped a 6-5 decision
to the Tarheels of North Carolina.
The teams were very even and
showed scrappy and aggressive play
throughout, but four fast goals were
enough to provide the margin of vic-
tory.

In the second period, the visitors
tallied two goals within ten seconds,
and another two-goal flurry in the
third period game them a 6-3 lead
going into the final quarter. The
Generals outplayed the Carolina
team in the final minutes of the
contest, as they scored twice to
move within a single goal, but Car-
olina gained control and held on to
win,

Even Contest Praised

The statistics indicate the closeness
of the two teams, as both shots on
goal and ground balls were nearly
even, and the visiting netminder,
Harvey Stanley, made 19 saves to
13 for Dave Johnson, who again
was outstanding for the home team.
The finesse of both goalies excited
the crowd time and again as each
made many fine saves.

Coach Swan lauded the team ef-
fort and felt the game was as
evenly contested as any game the
W&L stickmen have played this sea-
son. He cited the Blue defensive
play, which paralyzed the settled
play of Carolina’s offense. Most of
the victory goals came on fast breaks
or when the Generals were a man
down.

Johnson and Bendann Mentioned

Dave Johnson paced the defense
with his saves in the goal, and co-

captain Bendann played his usual
fine game, turning in a number of
crowd-pleasing clears, while fresh-
man Charlie Stewart continued to

work well with the close defense.
Bruce Jackson paced the offense
with two goals and was effective

on both the midfield and attack.
Freshman Bart Goodwin played his
finest game and scored on a beau-
tiful shot after dodging a surprized
Tarhell defenseman. All the attack
played well and Pittman was quite
active around the crease.

Duke Next Opponent

The contest was the closest the
Generals have come to victory since
their initial 9-8 win over Villanova
and with a _ concentrated effort
against Duke at Durham on Wednes-
day, the varsity stickmen hope to
gain their second victory of the sea-
son.

College, adopted at that time with
the authorization of the Virginia
legislature, was continued until 1871,
shortly after the death of General
Lee, when the present corporate title,
Washington and Lee University, was
assumed.

Construction of the Washington
College building, central unit of the
present group of academic buildings,
was begun in 1824. Three gifts—the
donation from Washington, a con-
tribution of funds from the Society
of the Cincinnati in Virginia, and a
bequest from John Robinson, a na-
tive of Ireland, a soldier under
Washington, and later a trustee of

Brunswick, Maine, where they are
also on the faculty of the Bowdin
College Summer School of Music. In
August, they will present three con-
certs at the second annual Bowdoin
College Contemporary Music Festi-
val featuring the premieres of three
works written for the Players.
Pierrot Lunaire

Miss Howland has been applauded
by such reviews as Virgil Thomson
of the Herald Tribune for her
“thorough and straightforward artis-
try.” One of her most widely ac-
claimed recent interpretations, and
a work which she has recorded, is
that of Arnold Shoenberg’s “Pierrot
Lunaire” which Miss Howland has
performed in New York, Chicago,
Boston, Pittsburgh and Washington.

Tonight

A number of composers have writ-
ten works for the Players. One of
these, “Contra Mortem et Tempus,”
by George Rochberg will be present-
ed Tuesday evening.

The rest of the program includes
“Trio Sonata in B Minor” for flute,
Violin and continuo by K. P. E. Bach,
a selection from Louis Spohr’s Opus
103, for voice, clarinet, and piano,
and “Pierrot Lunaire,” Opus 21 by
Shoenberg.

financial collapse. Classes had been
discontinued shortly after the out-
break of the war, and most of the
students had enlisted in the Con-
federate army under the name of
the Liberty Hall Volunteers. The
college building had been seriously
damaged, and many of the books
had been taken from the library
when the Federal army occupied
Lexington in June, 1864.

The college being without income
from its endowment at the close of
the war, the trustees borrowed mon-
ey on their private credit for the
repair of the ‘buildings and began
the work of rehabilitation. About
thirty years afterward the Congress
of the United States granted re-
muneration to the institution for
the destruction of property by the
invading army.

Lee Offered Presidency

On August 4, 1865, the presidency
of this war-torn college was offered
to General Lee. It was not the only

nineteenth
century. These three endowments to-

The War Between the States left
the college nearly on the verge of

a five-year period during which the
development of the institution was
phenomenal.

Lee Brings Changes

While the enrollment was being
expanded during General Lee’s re-
gime drastic changes were made in
the curriculum. During the first
year of his administration, five new
departments of study in liberal arts
were added, and an elective system,
within prescribed limits, was intro-
duced in place of the traditional
course of study. Then in 1866 the
law school was added through an
alliance with the Lexington Law
School, which had been founded as
a private institution in 1849. In the
same year a School of Civil and
Mining Engineering was organized.
The next year the foundation for the
present School of Commerce and
Business Administration was laid
with the establishment of a “Stu-
dent’s Business School.”

Also in 1869 General Lee proposed
the establishment of instruction in
journalism, and the trustees approv-
ed his plan for granting fifty schol-
arships annually to young men “pro-
posing to make printing or journal-
ism their profession.” The trustees
agreed to establish a college print-
ing shop or to make arrangements
with an established newspaper for
instruction to be given the students.

 

offer made to the leader of the de-
feated Confederate armies. He had
recently refused an offer of an es-
tate and competence in England, the
post of commander-in-chief of a

,| foreign army, and the presidency of

a large life insurance company at
a salary of $50,000 a year. He had
declined the presidencies of two

other Southern universities and had
refused to write his memories for
a publishing company on the ground
that it might fan hostile embers
which he believed should cool as
soon as possible.

Because he had been excluded
from the terms of amnesty in the
proclamation of the President of

the United States on May 29, 1865,
he delayed accepting the appoint-
ment as president of Washington
College, fearing that he might draw
a feeling of hostility toward the
institution. On August 24, however,
he decided to accept and informed
the college with a letter.

General Lee was formerly installed
as president of the college on Octo-
ber 2, 1865, and held this position
until his death on October 12, 1870—

FASHIONS

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

E-A-S-T-E-R-T-1-M-E! The very word begins to echo through the
quadrangle like an ignited stick of dynamite. Whatever other con-
notations it may hold for you, Easter Vacation always comes as a
last-minute antidote through which you escape—just in the nick
of time—your impending nineteenth nervous breakdown and the
breakneck pace of academic life. So, on your mark, get set, GO!
Chances are you'll be going South where the Spring grass is green
and the tropic sunshine good and hot. Time, that is, for tips on
what to take along...

NASSAU, ANYONE? No doubt T.S. Eliot wasn’t
thinking of the Caribbean when he labeled April
the cruelest month—not by a long shot. There’s
Bermuda, sitting like ‘an emerald ina sapphire }
sea;” there’s Ft. Lauderdale, where the girls are
and where the boys follow after. On the West
Coast, there’s La Jolla, or for the way out

swingers, Newport Beach, And if you really
want to get away from it all, there’s Mexico

te ES)

City. But whether you find your pipe-dream nn 2 a volcano or
under a swaying palm, remember to play it safe. Take along at
least one dark suit, a lightweight polyester and wool or a cotton
blend. You never know when you might be invited up to the Gov-
ernor’s mansion for drinks on the patio.

FOR THAT SMART, young millionaire look, you couldn’t do better
than select your dress-up resort wear in Navy blue. Dark gray’s
okay, and olive will do, but royal Navy has a rich, crisp look college
men like. And, incidentally, there’s no time like the present to look
for a Permanent Press suit. It'll keep the wrinkles out as Summer

comes sailing in.

WEAR WITH IT, a white or pale tone button
down shirt. It may be striped (and here the
color scheme of things is getting bolder and
brighter every day), or a solid color. Best bets:
pale blue, pale lemon, pink, or a creamy tan
shade. The new Permanent Press dress shirts
are great for travel for obvious reasons: you
wash them out at night, and the next morning,
without ironing (or puckered seams) they're
back in perfect shape. Take along a couple of
ties: a bright, bold paisley, a repp stripe, and
make sure they sport the new, fashion-right,
wider widths.

MAKE THE CASUAL SCENE in a Madras or

polyester/cotten seersucker sport jacket. Hers,
your color and pattern choice may be as wild
as your taste permits. You'll need a pair of dark,
medium, or ight gray dress slacks, and your
choice should depend on coordination with the
jacket, Jeans or chinos, three or four pairs, low-

rise, hip-hugging, and tapered in faded blue or
a wheat color, are mandatory. Make sure they
have built-in wash-and-wear capabilities. Ditto
with your sport shirts. Select three or four in
the popular Henley style in lightweight woven
fabrics, and a couple of cotton/polyester knits.

ON THE BEACH let your imagination drift around the sand

castles, But before you make the beach scene, be sure you're equipped
with several new swim shorts. Big, splashy Hawaiian surfer trunks
(usually available with matching shirts), and the new Basketball
swim short styles will be among the most popular this season, Most
young men prefer them in trim, athletic, form-fitting models, and
the word for surfing '66 is COLOR. Bright, burning reds, vivid yel-
lows, flashy greens, and wild prints are the top contenders.

THE TWILIGHT CHILL calls for a couple of colorful sweatshirts,

and a bulky, loose-knit “Poor Boy” sweater. Sneakers and sandals
are a must, of course, but even more imperative are shades and a
good suntan lotion. Slip a pair of black loafers into your suitcase,
zip it up, check out your reservations, and be off!

 

NEXT MONTH, we'll survey Spring and Summer fashions in depth.
Meanwhile, give our regards to the gang, and make every moment
count, Smooth sailing...
