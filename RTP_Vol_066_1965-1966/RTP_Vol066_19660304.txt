‘Richard I” Termed|
‘Opulent Spectacle’

By GEORGE W. RAY
Instructor in English

Some people thought it absurd for a new Troubadour director to open
with Waiting for Godot, I disagree. In fact, the choice of Beckett’s mod-
ern classic was a sane and conservative one, but it most emphatically is
absurd to follow Godot with Richard Il, a taxing play to produce and
direct even under the best of conditions.

Consider for a moment the two overwhelming local handicaps against
a successful production of a Shakespearean play: a narrow, claustropho-
bic proscenium stage which does not remotely resemble the open, multi-
layered, and admirably flexible Elizabethan stage on which Shakespeare's
plays were acted, and the lack of an experienced company to cope with
the special requirements of Shakespeare’s verse. Many members of the
cast are freshmen and sophomores playing their maiden roles; only two
members of the approximately thirty players are members of the national
honorary dramatic fraternity.

Yet, in the face of these formidable obstacles, “this happy breed of
men” (and women), under the sure-handed and imaginative direction of
Mr. Lee Kahn, has brought it off handsomely, The production, utilizing
the recently-installed revolving stage, is magnificently mounted, and pro-
vides the audience, quite literally, with a moveable visual feast. But,
in addition to the opulent spectacle expected of Shakespeare's histories,
the appreciative opening-night audience witnessed surprisingly strong and
sensitive interpretations of the major roles, Richard and Bolingbroke.

The basic stage props consist of a raised platform, a set of stairs, and
six pillars arranged in a semi-circle on the revolving stage. Alternately
adorned with curtains or heraldic emblems, the pillars suggest scene lo-
cations—a private room, the throneroom, the tournament site, a prison
cell—but they also function symbolically, as in Gaunt’s apostrophe to
represent “this demi-paradise” or to suggest a giant coronet within which
we literally see the flatterers whom Gaunt figuratively describes earlier
as sitting within Richard’s crown. The platform functions not only as a
castle wall but it also gives a vertical dimension to the stage which vis-
ually reinforces Richard's descent to the “base court” of unkinged hu-
manity.

As functional as these aspects of the staging are, however, the effective-
ness of the revolving stage seems questionable, at least in the case of a large
cast show not using an apron for extra floor space. Although the “re-
volve” does facilitate scene changes, it also severely limits stage space
since only the front half of the stage can be used at any one time.

Don Baker, in the title role, wisely avoids the temptation to play Rich-
ard as tragic hero. Instead, he offers a Richard long overdue for the
psychoanalyst’s couch, an arrested adolescent whose self-manipulating
narcissism paradoxically precludes any growth to real self-discovery and
manhood. Baker, who resembles a pre-degenerate Peter O'Toole, is well-
cast as the egocentric, self-pitying, spoiled playboy, and he effectively
projects Richard’s essentially self-destructive nature through effective ges-
ture, facial movement, and vocal modulation.

Jay Cady is convincing as the ambitious Bolingbroke capitalizing on
the power vacuum created by Richard's misrule. Playing against Baker's
effete Richard unsuited for the heavy burdens of kingship (emphasized
by the “business” with the crown in the deposition scene), Cady presents
a virile energetic young duke who matures to exhibit his abilities as a
stable ruler. Though at the end a less sympathetic character as a human
being than Richard, Cady's Bolingbroke does assure us that the realm is
finally in capable hands.

Tim Webster, playing the aged loyal counsellor, John of Gaunt, gives
a steady performance and an especially arresting, dynamically appropriate
rendition of the famous patriotic paean of England. As the Gardener,
Professor Keith Shillington once again amply demonstrates that he is at
home in both cultures. His horticultural advice makes explicit the serious
political import of the play, but ironically provides the only moments of
levity in an otherwise humorless play. Lew Davis, Jim Settle, Betty Kahn,
Lock Handley and Jeb Brown also render competent support in subsidiary
roles although Brown, it must be noted, brings the play dangerously close
to melodrama by overplaying Bolingbroke’s arrogant “hatchetman,” the
Earl of Northumberland. Such an interpretation reduces the central con-

Question of NSA A ffiliation
Debated by ODK Forum

By RUSTY MEYER

On Wednesday evening in Lee
Chapel the newly re-organized ODK
leadership forum sponsored a debate
on W&L’s proposed membership in
the National Student Association. A
referendum on this subject will be
held today.

Of the four speakers who appear-
ed, only one, Geoff Wainscott, was a
student on campus. The other three
were Joyce Riddle, president of stu-
dent government at Hollins; Phil
Sherbourne, national president ol
NSA; and Tom Pauken, chairman ol
the College Young Republican Fed-
eration.

The discussion was organized in

the form of a debate. Pauken andj noble
Wainscott, vice-chairman of the YR's| but that there is a vast difference

at W&L argued against membership;
Riddle and Sherbourne defended the
proposal.

In the next hour the two propon-
ents of NSA brought forth at least
five factors which they claimed made
the association worthy of the consid-
eration of our student body. First,

since its foundation in 1947 by sever-| convention ol

al veterans, the group has received
the endorsement of such national fig-
ures as John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B
Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Everett

The newly elected members will
be initiated in early April following
the University’s annual Phi Beta
Kappa-Society of the Cincinnati
Convocation. Shortened classes will
be held so that students can attend
the voluntary assembly honoring
the Phi Beta Kappa men.

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest Greek
letter fraternity in the United States.
It was founded at William and Mary
in 1776. Early secrecy was aban-
doned after criticism, and since 1846
the society has been strictly an hon-
orary scholastic fraternity. Mem-
bership in Phi Beta Kappa has long
been one of the highest academic
distinctions.

The purpose of the organization is
to recognize and encourage scholar-
ship and cultural interests. Qualifi-
cations for membership are high
scholastic average, liberal culture
and good character

Gamma Chapter

Washington and Lee’s local chap-
ter, Gamma of Virginia, was founded
in 1911 with ten members. Since that
date, the chapter has annually con-
ferred membership on students with
outstanding academic records. It now
has over 700 living members

Gamma Chapter considers each
graduating class by itself, not by
comparison with other classes. Elec-
tion is not based on any fixed per-
of the class and there is no
numerical requirement for

$15 per year and would cover any
and all services.

In reply, Wainscott and Pauken
brought out a number of facts that
changed the complexion of the mat-
ter a great deal. First, they pointed
out that most politicians endorse
such organizations as a matter of
good public relations, even though
they do not fully undertand the in-
tricacies of the group. Pauken said
that only last week a government of-
ficial phoned him and asked him
what NSA was, because he was
writing a letter wishing it well.

 

Second, Wainscott attacked the
manner in which NSA operates. He
said that he has no objection to the
idealism embodied in NSA,

between what the organization claims
to offer and its working structure. He
pointed out that NSA is not the most
representative form of student opin-
ion possible, as exemplified by the
fact that it is only composed of 325
schools, and of these only 45 per cent
sent members to the policy making
1963. He then
some NSA resolutions and proposals
for the U.S. to withdraw troops from
the Republic; to desist
from bombing North Viet Nam; and

Girls-In-Dorm
Aired by SAC

The Student Affairs Committee
deadlocked in a 6-6 vote yesterday
afternoon in its consideration of the
E.C.’s “Girls-in-the-dorms” resolu-
tion, and decided that the resolution,
as amended by it, should be present-
ed to the Faculty at its regular meet-
ing this Monday, for final action on
the proposal.

Law students Jack Ford and John
Peck presented the original petition,
after which the E.C. resolution was
explained by Junior Class represen-
tative Bill Jeffress. Lengthy discus-
sion saw the resolution altered to
include statements that the regis-
ters to be signed by students who
would be taking girls into their
rooms “must indicate either that:
a) the door be left open at least
one foot, or that b) there are present
in the room at least two females....
Abuse of the privilege by any stu-
dent will result in his appearance
before the Student Affairs Commit-
tee. The Executive Committee of the
Student Body agrees to consider fal-
sification of the register a matter
subject to the Honor System.
Students are obligated to respect the
rights of other dormitory residents
and the rules of the various girls’
schools in using this privilege.”

Arguments presented in favor of
the change of dormitory regulations
included statements that upperclass
dorm students have little opportuni-
ty to entertain dates, that numerous
other men’s schools permit girls in
their dorms, and that Wé&L students
are “gentlemen” capable of intelli-
gent and discretionary use of such a
privilege. Opposing arguments con-
tended that all dorm students at
W&L live in the dorms voluntarily,
whereas at most of the schools al-
lowing girls in the dorms, living in
is required; that only 23 per cent of
non-fraternity upperclassmen and
16 per cent af all law students act-
ually live in the dorms here; that
the projected student union will
supply many of the needed facilities
for all non-fraternity students; and
that W&L has no responsibility to
supply facilities for sex (the state-
ment “we admit that such actions
are likely to occur” made by back-
ers of the resolution was quoted)

THE RING.

TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition

WG L Herttage

The present struggle over conventional dress has a far
deeper meaning to us than the outward appearance of the
W&L student. What we are engaged in is fundamentally a
conflict of beliefs and intangibles, and the present manifesta-
tion of that conflict is the issue of conventional dress.

Washington and Lee tradition is a mystique. It cannot be
analyzed, disected, or stated in purely logical terms. It is a
sense of heritage, of lineal continuity with a great past, and
of present dignity of the individual. It embraces intangibles
such as honor, responsibility, gentility, and duty—that entire
magnificent social structure which characterized America of
Lee’s day.

We realize that times have changed; we know that the old
world and values of Lee are nearly gone. But we feel at Wash-
ington and Lee, at least, the great heritage can be preserved
without damage to intelligent thought or academic excellence.

In defending conventional dress, we are defending a be-
lief, not a system of logic. We are defending that entire heri-
tage of which gentlemanly dress is a small but significant part,
and we see great practical and spiritual value in protecting
that heritage here at W&L.

We realize that many do not agree with the heritage, and
that their opinions are honest and sincere. We are grateful to
these people for forcing us to think about our values because
in examining and understanding them, we can hold them more
intelligently and consciously. But we also wish the critics of
our traditions to realize that in attacking conventional dress,
they are attacking the whole system of traditions that is W&L’s
inheritance of a century and a half and a way of life, even to-

 

day.

So to those who would like to alter our our traditions: we
respect your position and arguments, but we also believe that
they are wrong. We welcome your dissent as a stimulant to
thought, but we hope that we may always maintain our distinc-
tive traditions in spite of dissent. And we understand your rea-
sons for wishing to change W&L, but we feel that they are
and that the valuable spirit of W&L

 

more valid elsewhere
should be retained here.

Dress Enforcement

The Friday Edition believes that the attempt to disassociate
enforcement of conventional dress with the tradition of con-
ventional dress is fallacious. The issue at stake is whether or not
a few individuals have the right to defy the traditions of the
University. If conventional dress is not enforced, these indi-
viduals will be given leave to ignore the wishes of the majority
and thereby weaken the effectiveness of the tradition. The
Friday edition supports both conventional dress and its en-
forcement by the Assimilation Committee.

Awad Pleads For Open-Mindedness
In Evaluating Enforced Dress Rules

By JIM AWAD
It wasn’t too long ago that W&L

almost solved the Conventional
Dress problem: The Assimilation
Committee existed in name, but as
an organization,
it was, for all

practical purposes,
defunct; at the
same time, a large
majority of stu-
dents were wear-
ing coats and ties
to classes.

The EC ripped
the controversy
open again,
though, by placing
a student on soc-
ial probation for his failure to ob-
serve conventional dress rules. Since
then, there has been a barrage of
literature supporting the EC’s de-
cision, conventional dress, and tra-
dition. It is about time for someone
to express the views of the “other
side.”

Without a doubt, the EC ruling
was within the bounds of existing
rules, and no one can criticize the
EC for exercising the regulations
they themselves put into effect. One
could ask why they waited so long
to exercise their powers, for there
are more than two hundred students

Awad

 

who substituted ski-parkas and|
sweaters for sport coats, but that |
would be kicking a dead horse. In- |
stead, let’s get at the roots of the|
problem:
Pro Argument
The essential argument of those in

power of the EC decision and of
strict enforcement of conventional
dress is that W&L is a school of

 

gentlemen. We wear coats and ties,
live by an honor system, and speak
to each other when passing by. “It
is tradition which makes this school
distinctive and great,” is their battle-
cry. I would like to attack this ar-
gument step by step:

Attack

First of all, no one would ques-
tion the absolute value of tradition
whether at a university, high school,
a business enterprise, or in a nation. |
There is something about tradition
which lends continuity to a fast-
moving and often chaotic world. But
is it tradition that makes a school
great?

So often the “old guard” at this
university answer in the affirmative
to this question; but they are pitiful-
ly mistaken. College is supposed to
be a time when an individual de-
termines what his place in the world,
will be. He is supposed to be ex-
posed to philosophies and beliefs of |
all kinds so that he may choose those |
which he will call his own.

 

The only way that one can attain
this total exposure is through the
decisive clashing of ideas in and out
of the classroom. Unfortunately, you
won't find this clashing of ideas out-
side of the classroom unless it is
preceded by an exposure within the
classroom itself.

Furthermore, before you
have stimulating classes, you must
have excellent, dedicated professors
interested students

can

and

Academic Excellence
What this boils down to, then, is

 

what? Washington and Lee is fail-
ing miserably in this area. If Wash-
ington and Lee is so great, where is
the stimulation in the classroom?
You know right well that 75 per
cent of the students here want noth-
ing more than diploma, and if some
do want more than that, all they
want is good grades. Furthermore, if
Washington and Lee is so great, why
aren't the best students in the coun-
try applying here, instead of too
Harvard, Yale, Penn, etc. If Wash-
ington and Lee is so great, where are
the devoted alumni who could very
easily give us the money we need
for a decent library, a better ath-
letic program, a student union, more
research facilities, and better pay
for our professors.

Gentlemen, I am not asking you
to abandon your tradition. What I
am asking you to do is to realize that
while traditions are an asset, they
are not distinguishing characteristics
that make a university great. Like
it or not, it is academic excellence
that does this,

Disdain for Individuality

Secondly, I would like to point out
that, unfortunately, those who ideal-
ize traditions are, in fact, preventing
W&L from becoming the great uni-
versity it could be. You insist that
everybody dress the same, act the
same, and, consequently, whether
you realize it or not, think the same.
In your idealistic search for a school
of gentlemen, you step on anyone
who seems to fall out of line. The re-
sult is a disdain for excess individu-
ality. The point is, that individuality
ought to be cherished and encour-
aged, for it is only through such in-
dividuality that you are going to get
the clashing of ideas cited above.

At this point you may say that
making exeryone dress the same
does not discourage individuality.
All I can ask you to do is to take
a look around you—look at the
facts. Whether it follows logically or
not, a state of affairs has come to
exist at W&L where everyone is the
same: If you show too much inter-

 

 

est in class or study too much, you're

 

Tokio, Japan

a flamer; if you don’t dress like ev-
eryone else, you’re a “grub;” and
if your political convictions are a
little too far to the left, you're a
socialist, and if they’re a little too
far to the right, you’re a reactionary.
In essence, there are no visible
signs of individuality at W&L. No
doubt, the common socio-economic
background of the large majority of
students is a factor in this, but blind
allegiance to tradition and conform-
ity also plays a part.
Clothes Do Not Make A Gentleman

Thirdly, while some run around
campus trying to make gentlemen of
every one else, they are, in effect,
accomplishing nothing. What I am
getting at is that it’s not clothing that
makes an individual a gentleman
(I’m more convinced of this every
time I see someone in a coat and tie
“drop trow” in front of a bunch of
girls). True, conventional dress does
look nice, but it still doesn’t make a
gentleman out of you. A student
wearing a sweater and ski-parka

Tie Trips Halfback

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

As did Dr. Phillips, who by the
way was one of the most entertain-
ing speakers that I have heard in
four years at W&L, I had a dream.
The year was
j 1966, the day that

| of the final game
' on the W&L foot-
_ ball schedule. The
| winner would be
i the new CAC.
| champion, rated
next to the lead-
| ed in the A.P. and
UPI. polls, but
the Generals were
losing by four
points with only
seconds left to play.

But then, with a burst of speed,
a General halfback broke into the
clear, racing toward the end zone
and the championship. The ball car-
rier neared the goal-line, and then
it happened, he was tackled—by his
TIE, trailing out behind him.

Washington and Lee lost the game
and the title, but even worse, the
halfback lost his tie, was assimilat-
ed, and then was, as law prevailed,
suspended from school.

Imagine that—halfback Mickey
Isikoff playing on Wilson field out
of uniform. What is the “W&L gen-
tleman” coming to?

(Extra copies of this column will
be made available to six members
of the E.C. upon request at the
Ring-tum Phi office).

Well, a new IM season is upon us.
Ping-pong is here, but what hap-
pened to pool? Some colleges act-
ually have intercollegiate billiards
teams—we don’t even have IM
teams, (but we do have two profes-
sors on the pool hall team).

Next on the agenda are softball
and volleyball.

Spring training for tubing at Go-
shen will begin the first sunny day
of next week. Get your tube now
before they run out. It’s a lot eas-
ier with a tube, a whole lot easier.

Trivia Contest Rules, Dates Announced

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Mannered Reporter
Thursday, March 17, has been set
as the date for the First Annual In-
according

 

When friends from the University
of Kentucky ask with a knowing
smirk “And how did the Washing-
ton and Lee Basketball Team do
this year?,” don’t hang your head
and mutter that we won 40 per cent
of our games. Stand tall, thrust out
your chest and declare stentorianly
“We just won 500 per cent more
games than last year.”

Yes, fans, with a 10 and 15 record
this year, the Generals are on their
way up. And with much of the team
returning, and, as Coach Verne Can-
field puts it “excellent recruiting
prospects” the team should contin-
ue to climb.

The keys to this year’s improve-
ment were undoubtedly team spirit
and team play. According to Can-
field, “There was no one star; each
boy played a starring role in at least
one game.”

Repeating last year’s victory over
North Carolina Wesleyan, the Gen-
erals also defeated Lynchburg Col-
lege (twice), R.P.1. (twice), Eastern
Mennonite (twice), Towson Siate,
Emory and Henry, and Southwest-
ern in the CAC Tournament last
week.

Statistically speaking, in twenty-
five games W&L scored 1823 points
to their opponents’ 1954, a per-game
average of 72.9 to 78.2. This breaks
down to 704 for 1748 from the field
(40.3 per cent) and 415 for 629 from
the foul line (66 per cent). The op-
posing teams were 752 for 1790 from
the field (42 per cent) and 450 for
633 from the foul line (71.1 per cent).
The Generals out-rebounded their
opponents 1343 to 1116, an average of
53.7 to 44.7 per game.

Coach Happy With Cage Season
As Generals Double Win Total

Freshman Rob Bauer led in the
scoring column with 371 points, av-
eraging 15.5 per game. Bauer was
followed by Frank Morrison with
265 (12.6) per game) and Bob Spes-
sard with 238 points, or an average
of 9.5 per game.

Last year the Generals were 2
17, defeating only Old Dominion and
North Carolina Wesleyan. The team
averaged 764 points per game
against their opponents’ 91.2 indi-
eating an immense improvement on
defense.

Canfield was relatively pleased
with the season, although it did not
come up to his pre-season hopes of
thirteen wins and twelve defeats.
The Coach asserted that there were
“a few we lost that we should and
could have had, such as UNC of
Charlotte.” W&L lost this one 76
to 78.

When asked about recruiting, Can-
field claimed that it was going “very
well,” pointing to a list of “possibles”
on his office wall, including one boy
rated best in his state. Canfield re-
turns from a recruiting trip today.

to the official rules released today
by Michael Anthony, secretary to
the producers. The preliminary com-
petition, which will consist of fifty
written questions, will be given on
Monday, March 14,

A total of six confirmed entries
have been received so far. In ad-
dition to the Phi Gam, Kappa Sig,
and NFU teams announced last
week, freshmen Bern Bonifant and
Robert Moselle will represent Phi
Ep; Tom Doss and Steve Saunders
compete for SPE; and Paul Schles-
inger and journalist Charlie “Dear
Mom and Dad” Bensinger will up-
hold the honor of ZBT.

According to athletic expert Gil-
bert Thorp, who is handicapping the
teams, the ZBT entry has to be
rated as the favorite at this time on
the basis of superior conditioning.
“There’s an unknown factor here,
though,” Thorp said. “We under-
stand that some member of the ad-
ministration, possibly Frank Parsons,
considering entering a faculty
team. Such a team would definitely
be a force to be reckoned with.”

Deadline for entries is Thursday,
March 10.

1. The preliminary quiz may be
taken at any time between 3 at!

Is

 

 

5 p.m., on Monday, March 14 in Reid
Hall. It will consist of fifty written
questions, to be worked on by the
team as a unit with a time limit of
twenty minutes,

2. The final competition will take
place Thursday, March 17 from 9 to
9:30 in the Home Edition studio,
and will be conducted according to
College Bowl rules.

3. Questions may be drawn from
the following categories: television,
radio, comic strips, comic books,
children’s books, old movies, sports,
and rock and roll.

4, Questions will be of three ord-
ers of difficulty: Difficult, Impossible,
and Unreal.

5. No substitutions will be per-
mitted once a team has taken the
preliminary quiz.

but one of basketball, Thursday,
March 10 at 7:30 in Doremus Gym-
nasium, as the Varsity Club pre-
sents the annual _ student-faculty

This year the game is being held
in order to raise funds to purchase
a camera capable of holding 400’ of
film, one to be used by all of the
athletic teams for scouting and oth-
er purposes.

The faculty team will be led, as
usual, by the Red Auerbach of

notable stars as Verne “Cagey” Can-

field, Joe “Bomber” Lyles, Norris

It is expected that the faculty will
substitute at a fast and furious pace
in order to match the speed and agil-
ity of the student team, made up of
members of each fraternity and the

Awad Discusses Dress Rules

(Continued from page 2)

can very well be more of a gentle-
man than one in a coat and tie.

Fourth, some claim that a coat and
tie makes one look neat. All I can
say to them is that there are a hell-
of-a-lot of students running around
here in sweaters and ski parkas who
are a lot neater than many wearing
coats and ties. You are simply not
going to make a guy dress more
neatly because you insist he wear
a coat and tie. It is a matter of per-
sonal values: a person who likes
to “dress well” will be neat, wheth-
er he has on a coat and tie or not;
and a person who doesn’t care that
much about his personal appear-
ance is not going to look neat,
whether he has a coat and tie or not.

Assimilation Committee

Fifthly, there’s the matter of the
Assimilation Committee. Whereas
the spirit of conventional dress is ac-
ceptable and even admirable, the As-
similation Committee, no matter how
you look at it, is detestable.

There is absolutely no moral, ethi-
cal, or practical basis for fining a stu-
dent or put him on social pro for not
wearing a coat and tie. If some of the
students at W&L like to wear coats
and ties—fine. As I have said, this is
admirable. But why do they have to
impose their values on others? They
may try to reason with a “non-be-
liever,” they may argue with him,
and they may set an example for
them, but who do they have to cruci-
fy him? And on top of that, why do
they make him pay a dollar? Is there
any connection between money and
not believing in what someone else
believes? Maybe they’re trying to
intimidate “non-believers” or try-
ing to take so much money from

Be sure to arrive at start of fea-
ture because ne one may enter

him that he’ll submit out of frus-
tration. Who knows?

At any rate, the dollar fine has
been abolished, but in its place has
been substituted social probation.
(From bad to worse). Now I ask,
“are they realizing the importance
of fraternities at W&L, by forbidding
a student from entering a fraterni-
ty house for four weeks because he
doesn’t believe in what they believe
in?” Ardently they are. I would like
to know what they are going to do
with a student they’ve placed on
social pro who still doesn’t wear a
coat and tie. Maybe they’ll suspend
him from school.

The idiocy of their actions speaks
for itself. All I have to say to them
is: Believe in what you want to be-
lieve in; and try to convince others
of the validity of your belief, but
don’t go around putting guys in so-
cial pro because they don’t agree
with you.

I could see doing so if the “non-
believers” actions actually hurt so-
ciety, but, being realistic, I don’t
think wearing a sweater instead of
a coat and tie hurts anybody, espec-
ially if the student wearing the
sweater is neat, and if he’s not, well,
that is his business. No matter how
much some are concerned with the
appearance of the student body as a
whole, they have no right to force
others to dress according to their
standards. Instead, as I have said
above, argue and set an example.

Above all, let us remain open-
minded.

ment should have been, Even Mick-
ey Isikoff will agree to that. Yet, so-
cial probation for a one month peri-
od entails some $70 expenses for
room and board and an _ untold
amount of inconvenience. It is, to
say the least, a very strict penalty.

In a few days, W&L students will
have the opportunity to express their
opinions on the Isikoff case. Each
student will have a vote as to
whether he thinks Isikoff's penalty
should be lessened or not. Every
Washington and Lee student has an
obligation to vote one way or the
other at this assembly. It will be a
deplorable situation if the student
body passes up its obligation be-
cause of apathy.

terizes so much of American edu-
cation.” That is to say, W-L’s main
distinction is that its students “vol-
untarily” (to quote the catalogue)
dress like “adults.”

Without this, it is apparently
feared, we might be indistinguishable
from the “mass of common non-con-
formism” (Berkeley? Wisconsin?
Ambherst?), the students composing
which have lost their individuality,
evidently, and all look alike because
they don’t wear ties. I would suggest
that if it is W-L’s unique individu-
ality that is at stake here, there are
all kinds of things which could be
instituted to prevent it from falling
into the pit of non-identity: like ev-
eryone could wear a purple beanie or
one red sock or white gloves—the
possibilities are infinite.

But this wouldn’t do—for the
whole point is, I take it, that W-L
boys dress like ADULTS, not like
mere students. Why this “value”
“manifestly deserves to be perpetu-
ated” (bold type mine) has not yet
been manifested to me, but I am wil-
ling to accept the possibility that I
am simply out of it.

What is more disturbing is the edi-
torial writer’s belief that there is a
minority conspiracy afoot to “snow-
ball the passive (sheeplike?) major-
ity into abandoning concepts of great
value.” If these people, he says
“simply stressing the importance of

 

individuality” (obviously, a minor
unimportant virtue) they could be—
“ignored” (after all, everybody
knows that old gambit; nothing
threatening here) or (reluctantly)
“even supported.” But this isn’t the
case. What these wantonly destruc-
tive individuals are doing is under-
mining “W-L’s greatest asset and
distinction” (conventional dress). If
it is true that the coat and tie uni-
form is our “greatest asset,” one
which alone gives W-L its unique
identity as an institution, seems to
me the time has come to abandon the
ship.

ODK Leadership Forum Holds
Debate On N.S.A. Membership

(Continued from page 1)
for the U.S. to introduce Red China
for membership before the U.N. In
addition, NSA has voiced opposition
to the American college fraternity
system.

Equally important is the fact that
the NSA opinions cannot be revised.
Its structure is such that those pres-
ently in control do not favor chan-
ges, and they can effectively prevent
them.

Third, NSA in fact can do little
for W&L. As an example, Wainscott
referred to an incident at Lawrence
College where student leaders dis-
covered that speakers and movies
provided by NSA could have been
obtained from individual groups for

 

much less.

Fourth is the fact that there is
growing displeasure with NSA
among numerous groups. Several
fraternity leaders have spoken out
against it. Thirty-three major col-
leges have tried the organization and
quit. Over a dozen others decided
against joining at all. In several
instances even NSA section leaders
have admitted a lack of effective-
ness.

And last is the fact that expen-
ses run far above the $15 base. Reg-
istration for conventions is $35, and
most schools including Hollins spend
up to $500 or more for room, board,
travel, and miscellaneous costs.

The final decision on NSA will be
rendered in today’s referendum.
