Draft Tests To
Begin Saturday

The first of three Selective Service
System examinations designed to
enable college students to continue
their 2-S draft deferments will be
given tomorrow at Washington and
Lee and at 1,200 other test centers
across the country.

The test, prepared and adminis-
tered under the supervision of Sci-
ence Research Associates in Chica-
go, will be given next Saturday,
May 21, and on Friday, June 3, in
addition to tomorrow. Students tak-
ing the test at Washington and Lee
should report to Reid Hall 203 by
8:30 a.m. Students assigned to VMI
are directed to Room 204, Old Sci-
ence Hall,

Each student must present both
cards which he received from SRA
in order to be admitted to the test.
Originally, fingerprinting was to be
mandatory in an attempt to keep
unauthorized persons from taking the
test, but earlier this week, Selective
Service decreed that any positive

form of identification will be ac-

cepted.

While a student's score on the ex-
amination will not alone determine
eligibility for a 2-S continuance, they
will be used by local boards along
with class standings and other cus-
tomary factors in determining eligi-
bility for a student deferment.

A score of seventy or better is
necessary, unless a students meets
his class-rank standards: for fresh-
men, top half of males in his class;
sophomores, top two-thirds; and
juniors, top three-quarters.

For current seniors who will be
attending graduate school in the fall,
the requirements are stricter: a score
of eighty, minimum, on the College
Qualification exam, or a rank within
the top one-quarter of his graduat-
ing class.

The examination itself will begin
at 9:00, and will be over about 1:00.
The test consists of 150 multiple-
choice questions and reportedly will
not favor any one subject area over
another.

 

Notice

University Proctor Bob Murray
said yesterday that the administra-
tion at VMI has decided to take
action against W&L students who
park haphazardly in the VMI park-
ing lot behind duPont Hall. Students’
cars, which recently have been park-
ed with no regard for white lines,
will be towed away by police. Mur-
ray hinted, however, that if students
show consideration and park away
from VMI buildings, leniency might
still be shown.

New Intellectual Activity
Committee Taking Form

Dean Pusey announced yesterday
the appointment of four W&L facul-
ty members to serve on the student-
faculty committee to study means of
stimulating student intellecual activ-
ity at the University. They are Drs.
E. C. Griffith, Professor of Econom-
ies, Marshall Jarrett, Assistant Pro-
fessor of History, William J. Watt,
Professor of Chemistry, and George
W. Ray, Instructor in English.

Earlier this week, the Executive
Committee named President Bill
Jeffress, Kirk Follo, and Jim Awad
as three of the student body's rep-
resentatives on the committee, with
the fourth to be selected presently.

The joint committee wa sestablish-
ed by the Faculty Committee on
Courses and Degrees at its April26th
meeting, as a result of the E.C.’s
presentation of the Independent
Study proposal. At this time, the new
committee was charged with a con-
tinued study of the Independent pro-
gram and other such plans, and was
given freedom to “pursue any line
of enquiry it seems feasible.” The
committee has ben asked to report
its findings and recommendations to
the faculty through the Course-and-
Degrees Committee during the first
semester of next year.

The Independent Study Program,
fostered by Awad, calls for the short-
ening of the first semester to end

Four reports with grade of “passing”

The new Dance Board plans to
begin its work next year at Fresh-

of freshmen entertainment prefer-

to cut the Board's Advisory com-

from the student body at large rather
than the present system of two rep-

Consideration is also being given
to raising the cost of dance plans

ing the information developed dur-
ing the hearings and seeing the
thoroughness of the investigation, I
feel that the Student Affairs Com-
mittee felt that the procedures of
the Judicial Board were thorough
and correct.”

The result is that the Phi Kappa
Psi Fraternity will go through Rush
Week and Openings next year under
conduct probation, a formal and
severe warning carrying serious im-
plications should gurther charges be
brought against Phi Psi.

Since it is in force during rush
week, the conduct probation penalty
has become much more potent than
it normally is. It is believed that
other fraternities will use the Phi
Psis’ perdicament against them in
competing for freshmen. In regard
to this problem LF.C. President Ren
Manning has warned that mention of
Phi Psis’ penalty during rush week
will constitute “dirty rush,” and will
be dealt with more severely than
usual.

Specifically, the Phi Psis had been
charged with long-continued dis-
turbances in their neighborhood and
the use of obscenities by Phi Phis
outside of the fraternity house. Dur-
ing the original hearing and the
appeal hearing, charges of threat-
ening a professor, keeping a girl in
the house after hours, and abetting
a fight in the Phi Psi parking lot
were thrown out.

 

ffens Cold Check

‘Rules; Changes Orientation

Committee whenever requested: an
E.C. member may accompany an
Assimilation Committee representa-
tive to speak to violators, but he
may not do so in an official capacity.
Each of these proposed motions
passed decisively, and are to serve
as a basis within which the Assimi-
lation Committee will work au-
tnymously.

On proposal made by Nash and
acceptd unanimously by the E.C.,
intentional cold checks will hence-
forth be considered honor violations
by the E.C. An “intentional” cold
check was unofficially defined as
being one written by a student on
insufficient funds, when he knows
that he does not have those funds,
and does not either post-date the
check or inform the person to whom
it is written that he does not have
funds.

The EC. pointed out that, as
is customary in consideration of pos-
sible honor violations, a conviction
for passing an intentional cold check
would come only after “full, complete
and unassailable” proof of knowledge
and intention had been demonstrated.

To effect the ruling, the Cold
Check Committee will be advised to
turn over directly to the E.C. cases
in which it suspects intentional
coldness; the E.C. will investigate
thoroughly in its usual manner.

(A complete explanation of the
ruling and the extent of its applica-
tion will be prepared by E.C. Nash
for publication in the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi.)

A strengthening of unintentional
cold-check violations was also pass-
ed last night. Under the new regula-
tions proposed by the Kendrick, a
$1 fine will be given for the first
cold-check offence; on the second, a
fine up to $25 and a letter to be
written to the violator’s parents; on
the third, warning by the Execu-
tive Committee; and on subsequent
violations, the E.C. will consider
recommending to Dean Atwood the
expulsion or suspension from the
University of the offender, depend-
ing on each case’s particular cireum-
stances. As in the past, cold checks
will be kept on record for two years

Lewis Indicates Weak Student Body
As Reason For University’s Problems

The Ring-tum Phi

Member of Virginia Intercollegiate Press Association
Friday Edition—May 13, 1966

 

No Integration Now

In light of the Executive Committee’s Monday resolution
to make “all possible efforts toward facilitating the assimilation
of any Negro student into the student body’’ and Fred Mindel’s
generous gesture in giving all of his Gilliam Award money to
further integration at W&L, we note with regret that there will
not be a Negro student here next year. The Admissions office

received no applications from Negro students this spring.

It is not particularly strange that no Negro would apply
to come to W&L. Despite our high academic reputation, there
is no indication that a Negro freshman could be happy in the

intelligent—they rank

I propose a Copernican Revolution
in attempting to expose the deficien-
cies of Washington and Lee. Prior
contributors to the Ring-tum Phi
have been quick to criticize the ad-
ministration and faculty. I, however,
will insist that the primary problems
at Washington and Lee are derived

body. The student body is homogene-
ous. Students are predominantly from
middle and upper middle class back-
grounds. They are white, Christian,
and Southern. I am not asking the
admissions office to turn W&L into
a sequester for the New Left, or a
haven for minority groups, or a
Southern Berkeley. I do, however,
suggest that a broader student body
be actively sought. A student body
which offers divergent backgrounds
and different outlooks is the begin-
ning of an academic community. If
students disagree—if their own ideas

ization of the student community
into small living groups which are
too homogeneous. Further, it shifts
the emphasis from the University to
the fraternity—from academics to
social life. No matter what actions
are taken students will select their
own friends. Moreover, students do
need a social outlet. But I suggest
that the University could be better
served by campus housing for up-
perclassmen. The types of social
dormitories, which have been so suc-
cessful and popular elsewhere, would
provide badly needed opportunities

interdisciplinary courses have be-
come popular at other academic in-
stitutions and are not found only
in the Ivy League.

Specificially, and without much
elaboration I offer the following pro-
gram which is used at another uni-
versity in place of the current Eng-
lish-history requirements employed
at W&L. The Greek tradition (It’s
disastrious that even a humanity
major can graduate from Washington
and Lee with no concept of the
Greek civilization), the European
tradition, the nature of literature,

social atmosphere that persists at W&L. The social domina-

are continually questioned—then one

for intellectual and social inter-

and philosophy (classic and contem-
porary). The first two courses would
emphasize the history and literature
of the particular period. The third
course would be an examination of
different forms of literature with
reading from representative authors
rather than sticking to English au-
thors. The fourth course is self-ex-
planatory.

Twentieth-Century Problems

Further, I recommend that stu-
dents be given a choice of courses
which would emphasize the problems
of the twentieth century. These
courses might include a course on
the twentieth century phenomenon
of revolution, war, and totalitarian-
ism for those who are politically in-
clined; or a course on the twentieth
century society consciousness and so-
ciety which might emphasize exis-
tentialism and psychoanalysis.
Obviously, I have not elaborated
these interdisciplinary studies or my
other suggestions in enough detail
to reach any final conclusions. I am
merely asking that the University
look around and see what new is be-
ing done in the field of education
and to carefully consider if Washing-
ton and Lee can be improved and
to determine if any of the programs
of other universities might aid in
the transformation of Washington
and Lee from one giant fraternity
into a genuine academic community.

would expect perpetual self-exam-
ination and a deeper probing of
ideas which are presented in the
classroom,
The Fraternity System

2. A critical re-examination of the
fraternity system. I believe the fra-
ternity system causes the decentral-

more than a “gentleman” C.
But hard study and a desire for
good grades, in my opinion, are not
enough. Most students treat the
grade as an end in itself or as an
option for graduate school. The gen-
eral attitude is that “if it’s in the
text book, I’ll learn it ‘cold’ for the
next hour quiz.” Apparently, there is
little true interest in ideas, little
extension of discussion into after
classroom hours; in short, a genuine
academic atmosphere is lacking.
Having attended another universi-
ty last semester, I think that I can
point out aspects of Washington and
Lee which are indicative of this at-
titude.

Where Students are Lacking
1. A mediocre college newspaper.
Other college newspapers have ar-
ticles concerning the research of
students and professors, book re-
views, comprehensive examinations
of the conflicts in modern society,
etc.
2. A dearth of genuine ideas and
criticism in class. Students are in-
clined to accept the status quo, that
is: the text and the professor. Sel-
dom does a student stand up and
question the validity of the text or
the professor's assertions. The profes-
sor’s lecture is spit back verbatim
on the hour test. Secondly, there
is no attempt to extend the text
book—to look for further implica-
tions of what has been said.

3. In addition to “2,” classroom dis-
cussions are fiascos. In those discus-
sion courses which I have taken, the

course. Space prohibits further elab-
oration of this idea.

3. A revision of the required
courses. I suggest a de-department-
alized training in the required hu-
manity courses which would empha-
size totality rather than the couse re-
stricted to English or history. These

tion of fraternities with their written and implicit discriminatory
clauses and their one-ball systems, the unabashed prejudices
of many students, the all-white student body, and the lack of
social life outside of the W&L community would militate
against the happiness of any Negro adventuresome enough to
come here.

Nevertheless, there are ways to make W&L more palatable
to the interested Negro high school student. The best way
would be for W&L students themselves to voluntarily show
their good will and willingness to accept Negro students into
the W&L community. The E.C.’s resolution, while more spir-
itual than concrete, is a step in this direction.

A better idea is that of Fred Mindel and his associates, en-
tailing raising funds from students to award scholarships to
financially needy Negroes wishing to come here and to extend
an information and recruitment service to Negro high schools.

We see no sense in “buying a school Negro,” but neither do
Mindel’s integration committee and the E.C. However, we do
emphatically wish to let potentially interested and qualified
Negro high school students know that they are welcome here,
and that there are many students who will sincerely try to assim-
ilate them into the W&L community.

 

 

 

Enough For Obituaries

As everyone expected, the faculty stuck to their guns on
the Southern Collegian issue and refused to reverse their Feb-
ruary decision to withdraw university funds from the magazine.
Had they reversed the decision, it would have resulted in an
intolerable loss of face in the perpetual standoff of Hill versus

The paintings above “Winter Landscape” by Rick Kearns,
and “All Together Now,” by Bud Goodheart, are pact of the
student art show being presented in duPont Hall through May

 

students.

Nevertheless, we regret that they did not at least give the
Collegian an adequate chance to reform itself. While past edi-
tions of the magazine have been generally objectionable to
older readers and to a few students, the last edition confirms
Drew Baur’s promise to redesign the Collegian as a satire mag-
azine. This last edition, while not literarily inspired throughout
and rather unfair in its satire, was enjoyable, relatively clean,

and showed considerable effort and good faith on the part of its

editor and staff.

But enough for obituaries. We hope that next year will see
a rebirth of a student-financed Southern Collegian as a satirical

and humorous magazine of student expression.

 

Welcome Alumni

The Ring-tum Phi welcomes back the classes of '16,'26, °41
‘51, °56, and ’61. Washington and Lee has changed in many
respects since each of the Reunion Classes graduated; we be-
lieve that these changes have, in general, helped bring the
University to a higher degree of greatness in its primary en-
deavor, education. In joining students, faculty, and administra-
tion to welcome you, we trust that you will like, as we do,

what we are becoming in the field of education.

A Professor Speaks Out .

A Liberal Arts Education Should Lead

By CHAPLAIN W. MORRISON

In the year and a half which has
gone by since I discussed the prob-
lem of grading in
a letter to the
Ring-tum Phi, my
opinions have un-
dergone a radical
change and I have
been asked to
state my new posi-
tion. Since it is
quite simple to
state—I think that
the coercive as-
peets of the grad-
ing aystem inhib-
it rather than foster genuine learn-
ing and that the present grading
system should therefore be abol-
ished—I would like instead to discuss
the larger preblem of education at
Washington and Lee in Rick Mar-
golies’ fine letter in this paper's last
issue. If an objection is made against
the letter that it seema overly hos-
tile to the school, 1 would answer
that I think there is a considerable
smount of hostility among the stu-
dents against the school—much more
than the administration and faculty
to be aware of-—and that |

appalling and their desire to partici-

a course is offered full advantage is
rarely taken of it.
4. In each class there are one or
two “browns” who always want to
talk to the professor after class. Why
is this not more prevalent? At the
University I attended last semester,
the professors were swarmed after
every class.
5. A total absence of academic in-
terests outside the clasroom. Every
once and a while, students—among
themselves—examine ideas presented
in the classroom. But this is not
common practice. I would expect
that students to some degree would
express an interest—outside the
classroom—in their academic work.
What To Do About It
I could list many more examples,
but I hope my point is clear. I seek
what is generally known as an aca-

short of this goal is painfully ob-

is only the first, short step to its

1. Diversification of the student

By STEVE MILLARD

May 12, 1991
Dear Joe,
Sorry to hear about your last-
minute meeting—we'd expected you
in Lexington last weekend. Family
plans call for a trip in your direc-
tion next month, so, I'll look forward
to seeing you then; in the meantime,
thought I'd send you some up-to-
the-minute impressions of our mu-
tual alma mother.
Numerically, the reunion was a
success. The class of 66 either liked
hell out of the place or felt in uni-
versal need of a trip to the sticks.
As might be expected, the wallets
and paunches were equally immense;
but, of course, that class also pro-
duced its share of real celebrities.
Frazier the Governer, Rider the au-
thor, Marchese the 15-cent pizza-
burger king—they all showed, as did
several others of some renown.

Still the main attraction was
the school itself, And, if the class
as a whole shared one impression,
it had to be a sense of continuity—
the feeling that today’s freshman

imagine, what is the reason for the
breakdown in communication at
W&L? This gets us back to the ques-
tion of purpose which Mr. Margolies
tried in vain to raise at the meet-
ing on fraternities. As his letter sug-
gests, at W&L what should be is al-
most invariably adjusted to what is
This is illustrated very clearly by

class is living through an exper-
ience remarkably like our own,
even in some quite specific re-
spects. Some of our classmates
make it back every year, while
some are in my position and sel-
dom get the chance—but all seem
to agree that W&L holds fast to
its particular mode of existence.

I'll save a play-by-play account
of the weekend for next month.
Right now my mood would prob-
ably be better expressed in more
generalized terms. The length of
time between my trips back seems to
give me an unusual perspective
when I do return; since you make
it back fairly often, you might find
a different viewpoint interesting.
Specifically, you're probably wond-
ering how I ean find much “eonti-
nuity” in things after my long
absence, in view of some pretty
striking changes. Let's look at it
from that angle.

When we graduated, the movement
to bring a Negro to campus was
just getting off the ground. Now, of
course, there are about twenty; a
few even belong to fraternities.
Change? In a way, nothing less
than a revolution.

But in another sense, it's not
quite the fundamental alteration it
appears to be. In the first place,
W&L was a belated follower in
the national change of values
which led to their admission. More
important—have you taken a good
look at the school’s Negro repre-
sentatives? In every respect ex-
cept skin color, those boys are
very much like a million other
WAL graduates, Economically, so-
cially, mentally—they fit perfectly
into the University's style of life,
The real change was the under-
lying value adjustment which per-
mitted them to be accepted on that
basis—a phenomenon far greater
Than Washington and Lee or any
other single school. The point is
not to criticize the University; I'm
just establishing a basis for my
feeling that continuity does exist.
Te cite another example: several
of the buildings on and around
campus were just a gleam in some-
body's eye when we left the place.
The Student Union, the new gym,
the theater—-remember what the old
ones looked like?’Surely, that must
be change

were. The athletic department still
operates for the benefit of guys who
came to school as students and hap-
pen to enjoy sports as a sideline. The
theater prepares a few people for
graduate work in drama; yet basic-
ally it still belongs to the student
looking for an extra dimension of
college life. The new Student Union
apparently strengthened the NFU
without damaging the fraternities.
These new houses simply represent
new variations on fine and familiar
themes.

The final touch was my brief
trip into the academic world.
There's no quicker way to have
“continuity” seared upon your
mind than to run into some of your
old professors. They're twenty
years grayer, but apparently it's
the same old story: the good ones
get betier and vice versa, Some

In short, Joe, it’s the same place.
In a particular way, Washington and
Lee is timeless. There are positive
and negative connotations in that
idea, both of which are quite inten-
tional. The school is always one step
slower to change than its academic
neighbors. Whatever specific moves
are made, they take place in leisure-
ly response to much more sweeping
changes. Yet this same environment
can help produce a uniquely person-

Bensinger Delivers Last Blast
Collegian, Cartoons, Keane, Panic

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, its been an interesting year,
the year of Big Brother. I have
learned many things in this wonder-
ful year. Indeed, I have learned that
one had better be
careful of how he
dresses if he wants
to see the inside of
his fraternity
house again.

I have learned
that the Southern
Collegian is trash
| from those who
| allocate my mon-
ey for me.

I have learned
that some people
are touchy about being referred to
in print and that others have a sense
of humor instead.

I have learned that cartoons had
better be just cartoons, not French
postcards.

I have learned that in four years
here one can hardly escape the
claws of the Great Molder, He Who
Makes All Alike.

I have learned that there should
be a course in catalogue compre-
hension so that the poor student can
see why he is to be castigated when
he sees on his obit the lines “as
found in the catalogue on page 69,”

I have learned that not all pro-
fessors use the same scale to eval-
uate students and that not all pro-
fessors use the same scale to evalu-
ate each student .

And I have learned that it’s not
always what you say but how you
say it and about whom you are
saying it that gets you in trouble.

But now as 4 a.m. passes I have
run out of resentments and have to
fill this space in other ways.

Other Ways

Poor Johnny Keane—the jockey
whose horse has just died. It isn’t
his fault that the Yanks are fighting
Kansas City and the other tail-
enders. It is simply that where the
Yankees once had strong young men,
they now have somebody's father.

Ralph Houk may pull them up
near the first division, but until
their farm system begins to produce
like others in the league they won't
be in the big show in September.

Just one note on basketball please.
In the NBA draft held a couple of
days ago there were three players
from Ohio Valley Conference select-
ed in the first three rounds. This is
the same conference that is Western
Kentucky's stomping ground.

They're for real, and only the ref-
erees saved Michigan in the NCAA
last year. Western loses only one of
its starters too, and his is the num-
ber five scorer. One day someone
is going to notice that it’s publicity
that makes some conferences what
they are.

 

Bensinger

Speaking. of basketball, there’s
more good news for those who watch
the local variety. It seems that
Coach Canfield has landed a 6’ 5”
boy who in the opinion of a member
of this year’s squad is better than
All-State Mel Cartwright, who also
will be here next year.

On top of this, about two inches
worth, there will be a 6’ 7” freshman
next year. He has promise it is
said. My God a W&L line-up aver-
aging over 3’ 9”—I think we might
be going somewhere.

Still Other Ways

58 Athletes Participate
In CAC Tourney Today

At present, Washington leads
the CAC with 65 points, followed
by Sewanee with 55, W&L with
4214, Centre with 37'!4, and
Southwestern of Memphis with 25.

The Generals will be relying
on their golf and tennis teams for
a major share of the point-getting,
while the track and _ baseball
teams probably will get a stern
test from Washington.

Washington and Lee's golfers
will carry a 4-3 record and a
recent fourth-place state tourna-
ment finish into the CAC. The
team will be led by senior Ed
Crosland, and freshman Bab Mat-
thews.

Crosland, who finished second
in the CAC a year ago at Se-
wanee, has been playing steady
golf this season, shooting con-
sistently in the low 70's. Matthews
also has been a low-70 perform-

er.

In baseball, the Generals are
fresh from a double-header win
ever RPI Monday, and carry a
3-5 reeord to St. Louis. Both hit-
ting and pitching have picked up
after a slow start, which could
mean a repeat of a second place
or better. The Generals have lost
to Washington in the finals two
times.

The track team seems the least
promising due to a shortage of
sprinters. Defending
Ric Mynntinen in the javelin,
Earl Edwards in the discus and
shot put, Lee Johnson in the dis-
tance runs, John Lawrence and
John Graham in the pole vault,
and Jim Thompson in the 880
should be contenders in their
specialties.

Carnival To Return To Lexington;
Sorry Fans, Darlene Can’t Make It

By OAK SEIBERT

Once again Lexington has been
the scene of a memorable moment in
sports. In a recent kickball game at
the local grade school the fans were
thrilled by a spectacular triple play
executed by the shortstop. He caught
the ball for one out, and then pro-
ceeded to tag out the runner going
to second base and then the runner
returning to second. The player in
question was not available for com-
ment after the game since recess
ended the hard-fought contest, but
it is believed he is being scouted by
Lexington High School.

Unfortunately for the local in-
stitution, the word around the
Southern Kickball Coach’s Associa-
tion Convention has it the local
athlete is headed for B. V. High.
Conjecture has it that he has been

 

offered something called an athletic
grant-in-aid. This term is obviously
being used as a cover-up, since no-
where in the entensive facilities of
Macmac Library is such a term de-
fined. It is too bad that the local in-
stitution is going to lose the boy,
since he could have done a great deal
to improve the team and help revive
interest in the sport and improve
school spirit on the part of the stu-
dents and alumni.

Incidentally, there really has been
a group of students watching the
kickball games recently. Who says
there isn’t anything to do in Lex-
ington,

Rueger-less Racketmen
Lose To R-M; Defeat H-S

By JERRY PERLMAN

Washington and Lee’s free- swing-
ing netters, minus the services of
number one singles player Tommy
Rueger, managed to split a pair of
away matches this week. Rueger,
who re-injured his right wrist last
week against Old Dominion, was left
at home as Coach Canfield’s boys
traveled to Hampden-Sydney on
Monday and Randolph-Macon on
Tuesday.

In Monday’s match, Rueger’s ab-
sence was not substantially felt, as
the Generals swept the first four
singles matches and all three of the
doubles for an easy 7-2 triumph.
Team captain Forrest Dickinson,
playing for the first time in the num-
ber one slot, breezed to a 6-2; 6-0
victory. This was followed by Phil
Thompson's 6-3; 6-2 victory at num-

” ber two, Ray Turman’s 6-1; 6-2 win
*

at number three, and Wick Velline’s
8-6; 8-6 triumph at number four.
W&L's loss came at the number five
singles spot, where Charlie Lee drop-
ped a 6-4; 6-4 decision. This was
followed by Steve Greenia’s 6-4;
7-5 defeat at number six.

The doubles were then swept by
W&L, with Dickinson and Thompson
taking number one 7-5; 6-1, Steve
Case and Fred Taussig coming from
behind for a 6-8; 6-1; 6-4 victory
at number two, and Turman moving
from his usual number one doubles
slot, teaming with Lee for a 6-4;
6-2 win.

On Tuesday, though, Rueger’s
services were sorely missed as the
Generals suffered their second loss
of the season, at the hands of the
Yellow Jackets of Randolph-Macon
by a 5-4 margin. Canfield, trying
to make up for Rueger’s absence,
juggled his line-up and sent his
number six singles player, Lee to
face the number one Yellow Jacket.
Lee, playing far out of his league,
dropped a 6-0; 6-0 decision. Then
Canfield’s strategy began to pay off,
as Dickinson breezed to a 6-0; 6-2

 

The Bell System has many small, eutomatic

telephone offices around the
country. The equipment in them
could operate unattended for
ten years or so, but for a problem.

The many electric motors in those offices
needed lubrication at least once a year. Heat
from the motors dried up the bearing oils,
thus entailing costly annual maintenance,

were conducted at Bell Telephone

But the Yellow Jacks proved to be
too strong down the line for the
Generals, taking all the remaining
singes matches except number four,

feated singles record intact, pulled
off a 6-4; 7-5 victory.

Lacrosse Loses

The varsity lacrosse team battled
the Virginia Cavaliers valiantly in
their final game of the season Wed-
nesday but emerged on the short
side of 6-2 decision.

Coach Swan felt the team gave
the visitors a good fight, but it was
not one of the stickmen’s better ef-
forts. Virginia scored two goals in
both the second and third periods to
gain a 5-2 advantage with the final
quarter remaining. Tom Pittman,
who assisted Jay Bowersox on the
first General tally, netted the final
General score of the season in the
third period, but the offense was
unable to score in the final quarter.

This was the final game of long
and illustrious athletic careers for
co-captain Billy Andrews, Bruce
Jackson, and Jay Bowersox. Each
climaxed a fine season, as high scor-
ing Jackson paced the offense
throughout the year. Andrews was
the defensive standout on the mid-
field, shutting out his man in the
final three contests. Bowersox finish-
ed close behind Jackson in scoring.
All kept the team spirit up and
constantly helped the younger and
inexperienced players.

At the team party following the
game, Coaches Swan and Van Rens-
selaer ware presented with tokens
of the team’s appreciation for their
patience and understanding during
the season. Lance Bendann was re-
elected captain for the ’67 season.

of a liberal arts college like Wash-

the world and their place in that

many of them become obsolete very

Traditions—Stagnation
(Continued from page 2)

al version of the educational process
I pretty well missed the boat when
I was there, and have since wond-
ered if the school itself really rec-
ognizes its own possibilities. Univer-
sity leaders insist upon emphasiz-
ing the treasured “traditions,” which
are really beside the point; they
might be better advised to examine
the inherent possibilities of size and
environment, which are the point.
Anything which enhances the stu-
dent-professor and student-student
relationships is a natural step for
that school: more seminars, changes
in the grading system, further inde-
pendent work, and the like. “Time-
lessness” can convey a sense of stag-
nation—or, perhaps, a bit of the eter-
nal. For the time being, W&L con-
tinues in its own curious middle-
ground.

totally disappointed in the perform-
ance of players. Captain Dickinson,
he said, “played the best tennis of
his entire life. The team that he
and Thompson defeated had been
undefeated in fourteen previous
matches.”

The Generals now take their 7-2
record to St. Louis for the CAC
championships this weekend, and
their hopes in the tournament hinge
on whether or not a week’s layoff
has given Rueger’s wrist a chance
to improve. A sound Rueger at
number one could result in a W&L
victory but without him, the Gen-
erals have to be considered definite
underdogs. Canfield was quoted as
saying that he expected Washington
U. and Sewanee to be the teams to
beat in the tourney, with the team
from St. Louis having the home
court advantage and the seasoning
provided b ya 21-match schedule, as
the definite favor.

In other recent tennis action,
W&L’'s freshman team finished its
season with a 3-2 record, registering
an easy 9-0 win over Fishburn
Military School. In a match in which
none of the freshmen were pressed
for a win, the only highlight was
the appearance on the court of Son-
ny Nunbhadoi, the son of the Vice
Chief of Staff of the Army of the
Republic of Thailand. Playing in
the number two slot for Fishburn, he
dropped a 6-0; 6-2 decision to Don

in apparent error, Faulk said, in
stating that the resolution encourages
“recruitment” of “at least one” Ne-

merely to back up responsible efforts
by students in encouraging such ap-

tertainment and a break from this
studious atmosphere. Rumor has it
that Darlene, one of the real crowd
pleasers last year, is not back, but
has instead gone on to bigger and
better things in show business. Her
act should be hard to follow but I'm
sure some of the new entertainers
will rise to the occasion and come up
with something new.

The
involves a type of theatre-in-the-
round where the audience is in the
center instead of on the circum-
ferance. At one end there would
be an ordinary proscenium stage
where simple drama might be
staged, but surrounding the audi-
ence would be a platform about
fifteen feet wide. To allow the
audience to follow the action as it
moves around them by scenes, seats
would rotate 360 degrees. The cur-
tain, Kahn explains, would be
made in sections, so that all or
any part of the stage could be
bared at any one time. This, Kahn
says, would “allow us to do any
type of theatre we want to.” The
circular nature of the stage with
the audience surrounded by the
action would tend to bring them
into participation in the play and
cause it to be more a part of the
“theatre group” which includes not

Since the University will not sup-
ply funds for the building of a new
theatre, which it seems to feel (un-
fortunately fo rthe performing arts
at W&L) is not worthy of strong
consideration at present, Mr. Kahn
has had to go to outside sources.
He took a recent trip to New Or-
leans where he talked with Mr.
Monroe Lippman, the head of thea-
tre at Tulane, about approaching
cerrtain foundations for the funds
with which to build such an addi-
tion to our physical plant. The
problem, though no real problem at

all in Mr. Kahn’s eyes, is that these
foundations would build a theatre
only if it were to be new and ex-
perimental; they would not build

Kahn Wants New Theatre

only actors and stagehands, but
the audience itself.

Though the whole affair is only
in the visionary stages, Kahn has
been thinking about where the new
theatre would be built. He is un-
able to give a definite idea yet,
but in connection with his plan to
bring the theatre more into W&L
life, he wants it nearer the campus.
One of the things which keeps
students away from Troub presen-
tations is that the theatre is poorly
located. Another, more important,
lack is that of comfort and attract-
iveness. The new theatre would
solve these problems and more,
making the whole atmosphere one
of real enjoyment, rather than mere
visual entertainment.

Kahn's ideas in the realm of ex-
perimentation are not only re-

Mr. — stricted to the theatre building it-
Hendrickson has made suggestions

to Khan and has produced many
interesting ideas for the proposed
theatre. One of these suggestions,
which seems to be Kahn’s favorite,
it what Kahn calls “a theatre-in-

self; he is interested in experi-
mental dramatic literature. In the
next season, if possible, and if not,
then in the near future, he would
like to present Peter Weiss’ new
Marat/Sade play, an offshoot of
the Theatre of the Absurd and of
the Theatre of Cruelty; Becket by

Jean Anouilh, which will be the
Troub’s first play next season and
which, as Mr. Kahn describes it, is
“a beautiful show”; and some
Brecht, perhaps Galileo or The
Chalk Circle.

Lee Kahn will find no rest dur-
ing the summer. He is directing the
first play in the Rockbridge Play-
ers’ summer series, Gibson’s Two
For the See-Saw, from June 13th
through June 18th. He then moves
north to Williamsport, Pennsyl-
vania, where he is guest-directing
that city’s last summer-stock play
of the season. He is planning to do
a period farce, but is not yet
sure which one. Beggars’. Opera
looms as a possibility.

From the enthusiasm that Mr.
Kahn has raised this year, it ap-
pears that the Troubs are in for
“better-than-ever” seasons next
year and in those to come.
