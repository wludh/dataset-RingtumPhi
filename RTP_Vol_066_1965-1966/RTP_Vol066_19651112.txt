Law School Conducts Trial

Based on Actual Ciil Suit

By JIM McCOMMONS

Last Tuesday the law school held
its semi-annual mock trial based on
an actual civil suit that accurred in
Alabama last year. The Mock Trial,
presided over by The Honorable M.
M. Long, rendered a judgment that
was in accordance with the decision
passed down in Alabama.

The Mock Trial Committee of the
Student Bar Association was respon-
sible for the organization of the
trial. Baxter Davis, senior law stu-
dent and chairman of the committee,
and intermediate law students Jeff
Ward and Chuck Bowie began
studying the transcript of the Ala-
bama trial several weeks ago. They
reduced the case to a set of basic
facts by eliminating superfluous
details which did not change the
legal issues of the case. They then
set these facts to the Lexington lo-
cale.

The case presented at the Mock
Trial involved a truck driver, the
defendant, who had left his truck at
2:30 a.m. parked | on a the road un-

YR’ S To Hear

GOP Officer
Ray Humphries

Ray Humphries, Director of the
Political Education and Training Di-
vision of the National Republican
Party will address the November
Young Republican Club meeting
Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in the biology
lecture room in the New Science
Building.

Humphries, who has been called a
dynamic and enthralling speaker by
Young Republican Officers who have
heard him, will lead a series of sem-
inars immediately after his address.
Among the presently scheduled half-
hour meetings will be those with
the 1968 Mock Convention Coordi-
nating Committee, all students in-
terested in a career in politics, and
the Young Republican officers.

It was announced that this meet-
ing will initiate a new policy of giv-
ing away a doorprize of a bottle of
bourbon.

The November meeting will also
serve as a kick-off of Stage Two of
the membership drive through which
the Washington and Lee YR Club
hopes to become the largest in Vir-
ginia. As incentive, the Club is of-
fering a $45 sporicoat from the Col-
lege Town Shop to the person who
can sign up the most new members.
Interested students desiring member-
ship are encouraged to Jeff
Wainscott in 205 Baker Dormitory.

lighted, because a rear wheel was in
danger of causing the truck to jack-
knife. He caught a ride into Lex-
ington but was unable to return
with a repairman for several hours.
In the meantime, a car had crashed
into the rear of the truck, killing a
man, but not seriously injuring his
wife.

The wife filed charges for wrong-
ful death. The $35,000 awarded her
in the mock trial is the maximum in
a Virginia wrongful death action.

Chief counsel for the plaintiff was
senior Charles Bistany. Associate
counsels for the plaintiff were senior
Henry Counts and intermediate Tom
Meadows. Chief defense counsel was
senior Danny Bird. Seniors Phil Mil-
ler and Al Prillaman were associate
defense counsels.

The witnesses were played by stu-
dents from the law school. Each stu-
dent was given only the facts known
by the witness he was portraying
and general information about the
case.

The jury was comprised from
townspeople from Lexington who
gave their time to assist the law
school.

mock trial attended.

Cornell Sestaeene
Lectures On Pascal

And Creative Spirit

Morris G. Bishop, a well-known
author and teacher, spoke Wednes-
day night at VMI on “Pascal and
the Creative Spirit.”

Dr. Bishop is Professor Emeritus
of Romance Literature and Universi-
ty Historian at Cornell University.
He has been a lecturer at the Uni-
versity of Athens. He is currently
president of the Modern Language
Association.

The lecturer defined genius by giv-
ing a biographical sketch of Pascal.
This seventeenth-century Frechman
paved the way for the invention of
ealculus and made important con-
tributions to gas pressure laws. Math
and physics soon came to bore him.
Pascal then became the leading op-
ponent of Roman Catholic funda-
mentalism. His Lettres Provencales,
defending his religious belief, became
the basis of modern French prose
The collection of his philosophical
notes, Pensees, is included in the En-
cylopedia Britannica's collection of
Great Books.

Readings By Poets Kizer, Stuart

The seminars in Literature Com-
mittee presented a reading by poets
and Dabney Stuart
in duPont Auditorium Tuesday
night.

Miss Kizer, the founder and editor
of Poetry Northwest, was introduced
by Mr. James Boatwright of the
W&L English department. He said
that the most important quality for
a poet is an individual tone of voice,
and that Miss Kizer has such a voice.

After thanking Mr. Boatwright for
his remarks, the poet said that she
has tried to develop a voice of this
kind in her latest book, which was
inspired by Chinese poetry. Her first
“spotty.”

Bogan, Kunitz Read

Alter reading several poems from
the second volume, she asked per-
mission to read from the works of
two other poets whom she described
as “neglected,” Louise Bogan and
Stanley Kunitz. She read a poem,
“Second Air Force,” by Randall Jar-
rell, who was killed by an automo-
bile two weeks ago.

In closing, Miss Kizer read a long
poem inspired by the works of
Heinrich Heine, which she described

s “the kind of poem I think Heine
would have written if he had been
an American and a woman and had
led the life I have.”

In introducing Stuart,
the W&L faculty this year, Boat-
wright described him as “a poet
who is frequently personal and al-
ways moving.”

Stuart began by reading two love
poems and a poem written as
“Shakespeare speaking to
through the Fool in King Lear.”

poem he has been working on for
three years. Entitled “The Fair,” it
represents life as a series of side-
show acts at a carnival.

His next three selections came
from his new book, The Diving Bell,
which will appear next April. He
described it as “a tribute to the peo-
ple who have influenced me in one
way or another.”

His final poem, the only one writ-
ten since he has been at W&L, was
entitled “The Student.”

Miss Kizer also met with Mr. Boat-
wright’s classes in modern poetry,
where she discussed the works of
Theodore Roethke, an American poet
whom she knew for many years.

The reading was the 53rd lecture
sponsored by the committee. Notable
figures who have appeared under the
auspices of the program in the past
include critics Northrop Frye and
Hugh Kenner and poet Miller Wil-
liams.

‘No Change’ Backers

Supporters of Saturday classes
won a narrow victory in last
Wednesday’s referendum, with a

total vote of 358 in favor of keeping
the present six-day week and 275
in favor of a change.

The EC, however, expressed dis-
appointment that only 633 students—
less than half of the student body—
had voted in what the EC considered
to be an important opinion poll.

The referendum was to climax sev-
eral years of formal and informal
discussion on the topic.

On Tuesday, Nov. 9, in order to
present the issue to the student
body before the referendum, the
varsity debate team, in cooperation
with the Forensic Union, sponsored
a debate on the topic, Resolved:
That Saturday Classes Should Be
Abolished.

Speaking for the affirmative were
Dave Marchese and Rusty Meyer,
and for the negative, Bill Grant and
ireshman Jim Hamill. Kaz Herchold
* served as chairman for the debate.

Following the referendum, the
following statement was made by
Richard Nash, a sophomore EC rep-
resentative:

Nash's Statement

The votes have been cast and
counted, but the full significance of
the results has not yet been weighed.
On Wednesday the students of Wash-
ington and Lee got the chance to
express their views on the abolition
of Saturday classes. The vote was
358 for keeping them and 275 for do-
ing away with them.

Where do we go from here? It is
the task of the Executive Committee,
with regard to the results, to make
a recommendation to the self-study
group. But just what that recom-
mendation will contain is a bigger
question than is immediately com-
prehended. The easiest course of ac-
tion wold be to recommend that we
keep Saturday classes because more
students are in favor of keeping them
than are in favor of abolishing them.
But after looking at the situation a
little closer, one finds that it is not
quite that simple. There are several
points that must be viewed first.

On October 8 of this year there
were 1337 students enrolled in the

Par wie Win 83-Vote Victory

University. Less than half of this
enrollment, 633, voted on the refer-
endum. Are we to assume that the
problem of Saturday classes is not
major enough to even arouse the
interest of half of the student body?
If this is to be assumed, then there
is no reason for the present sys-
tem not to be continued.

But the validity of this argument
is questioned. Very seldom does vot-
ing at Washington and Lee, exclud-
ing elections, poll over half of the
student body. Last year, a referen-
dum concerning political parties,
which was heatedly discussed and
much publicized, received barely
over five hundred total votes.

Consequently, there is the question
of whether we should make a judg-
ment based on the vote taken, or
consider the entire issue of little im-
portance.

(1) A five day week would have
included many inconveniences. The
prospects of having afternoon classes
and ninety minute class periods was
put forth to the students by way of
news articles, editorials, and a de-
bate. Yet two hundred and seventy-
five students, fully realizing these
inconveniences, voted for the aboli-
tion of Saturday classes anyway.

(2) In addition to this, many of
the three hundred and fifty-eight
students who voted for a six day
week, do sothinking that there was
a possibiilty of the abolishment of
Saturday classes on big weekends.

It seems that a logical course of

on the Cold Check Committee

The appointment of a freshman to

since one of the applicants was un-
able to appear for the interview.

It was also announced that appli-

Where Were You?

Although Wednesday’s referendum on Saturday Classes
drew only 47 per cent of the student body to the polls, it does
seem rather apparent that Washington and Lee students favor

keeping Saturday classes.

The matter has now been dropped by the Executive Com-
mittee as far we can ascertain. The Self-study Committee has
gotten its answer. The Ring-tum Phi questions, however, what
the other 53 per cent of the student body thinks.

Is it too much to ask of students to cast a ballot either for
or against a proposal which could change University policy as

would Saturday classes?

Awad Queries Quiz System

By JIM AWAD |

American society of 1965 is struc-
tured in such a way as to make a
college degree of
utmost importance
to every individu-

al. Consequently
many of us go to
college without
even considering
the value of var-
ious alternatives.
But worse than

this, many of us
go through college
itself without
questioning the
purpose and value of what we are
doing.

This columnist has given consider-
ation to the above question and feels
compelled to make a few comments.

To say the least, the system of
higher education in the United States
isn’t what it could be.

Let’s look at the lecture system
first. It seems that this system
does have a definite value, provided
that the professor is of exceptional
quality. But it's when you hit the
bering professor that the system
breaks down. Have you ever sat
through fifty minutes with a boring
professor? It’s pure agony.

Anyway, the guy stands up there
for fifty minutes and drones on and
on about what seems to be nothing.
If he does have anything to say, he'll
never get it across, first of all because
he doesn't know how to, and second-
ly, beeause all the students are
probably asleep.

A lot of people today are scream-
ing about the lack of motivation in
college students. Well, it all begins in
the classroom. It is the exceptional
student who can maintain a maxi-
mum degree of interest in a course
when the professor shouldn't even

teaching. Granted, this type of

 

Awad

 

the professor is in the minority, but
he’s still all over the place, and he’s
hampering the goals of education
(whatever they are.) It would seem
that an essential element of educa-
tion is a clashing and interaction of
ideas. How can this interaction take
place when the person who is sup-
posed initiate the interaction
doesn't know how to do so?
Secondly, let's look at the
of hour quizzes. It seems these

to

cone

cept

  

julzzes fall short of accomplishing
their purpose. Somehow, they ot
upposed to aid the student in the/|

imi process—-perhaps by giving |

forced stimulus.” What hap-

 

 

ns in practice, though, is that the
tudent hibernates in the library for

phies, and problems inte his head

This in itself isn't too bad, but what
is really poor is that the student is
compelled to write a paper in such
a way as to pass the particular stand-
ards of a particular professor. This is
where we run into trouble. Profes-
sor A likes facts, while Professor B

(teaching the same course) likes
generalizations.
Well, which is more important,

facts or generalizations?

The third deficiency seems to be
that the grading of the paper de-
pends totally on the professor; there-
fore, various unnecessary variables
enter into the grade—i.e.: how many
times you cut class, whether the
professor was in a good mood, how
much time he had to grade the
paper, your past performance, how
much browning you did, etc. It seems
that grades are much too import-
ant to have such variables included
in their calculation.

And it seems, finally, that final ex-
ams suffer from the same deficiencies
as quizzes, except on a proportion-
ately larger basis.

In essence, then, this system of lec-
tures, quizzes, and final exams lack
the elements of motivation, perman-
ent retention of subject matter, and
objective grading. One thing is sure
though, and that is that you couldn't
change one aspect of this system

without changing the other two
Quizzes, final exams, and lectures
are muually dependent on each

other. Also, the faults cited above
go hand in hand with this system.

W&L’s Artist Dislikes Artistic Faddism;
Enjoys Teaching, Fishing, Abstractionists

Ray Prohaska, who is now in his
second year as W&L’s Artist in Res-
idence, is a big, genial man and a
man who obviously enjoys life.

“IT can’t remember when I didn’t
want to be a painter,” he says. “It’s
a hard life—you have to make all
kinds of sacrifices before you get es-
tablished—but for me it’s the only
life. I love painting.”

He was speaking in connection
with the exhibit of his work which
is now on display in duPont Hall; a
remarkable and varied collection,
ranging from abstractions to full-
length portraits and from oils to
lithographs.

Also included are two paintings
done as illustrations for the Satur-
day Evening Post, which prompted
a question about how much of this
kind of work Prohaska has done. The
artist replied that he has done quite
a bit, although with many magazines
folding or changing their format
there is much less opportunity in
this field, which used to provide a
living for a good many artists.

“Of course, illustration work has
its drawbacks,” he said. “You don’t
get the chance for real self-expres-
sion—though this depends on the
kind of reader the magazine gets. An
intellectual rag, for instance, allows
a lot more freedom because its read-
ers know something about painting.”

As is evident in the collection,
which is dominated by pictures of
fishermen, Prohaska loves to fish,
especially in the surf. “In fact, that’s
the main thing I dislike about teach-
ing here, because I’m stuck here in
the fall when the surf fishing is best.
There are smallmouth bass in the
creeks around town, and some hatch-
ery trout in the spring, but nothing
I can get excited about.”

On the whole, though, he likes
W&L and likes teaching. “The people
and the country are nice. And teach-
ing gives me a lot of time to paint.
I ean work in the morning and teach
in the afternon, which suits me fine.
I expect to be back next year, though
I miss New York and my home on
Long Island.”

His plans for the future include
the installation of a press for etch-
ing and lithography work, which the
fine arts department already has but
is not set up yet. This will be used
by students who are interested in
doing print work.

In talking about his own career,
Prohaska said that he was influenced
in his youth primarily by Cezanne.
Later, he became “semi-involved”
with the New York school of abstract
expressionism led by Jackson Pol-
lock, Willem DeKooning and
others, all of whom he knew person-
ally.

“But I wouldn't call myself a mem-
ber of the New York Movement,”
Prohaska says. “I've never been in-
terested in developing a personal

style in order to make a reputation. |
I work in one style for a while, and |

then get bored with it and go into
something else. Maybe this is the

wrong way to work, but I prefer it. |

“In facet, I think this business of
style is too much overdone today,
especially in this country. Ameri-
cans have to have labels for every
damn thing. The minute you do

something, somebody slaps a label
on it. And then they get tired of it,
and out it goes, whether it’s any
good or not.

“Take this thing about Pop art.
There are some good artists in this
movement—Bob Rauschenberg and
Jasper Johns, for example, although
they tend to be overshadowed by
pure gimmickers like this Andy
Warhol—but all they are doing is

rehashing old ideas, redoing things
that were done forty years ago by
people like Marcel Duchamp and
Man Ray, and done better at that.
“For instance, the real point of
Pop art, which is the feeling for
the vulgarity of American culture,
was expressed by Stuart Davis back
in the Thirties better than anybody
could ever do it again.”
He feels the same way about optical

 

“Tragic Realists’ ” Philosophy Examined

 

Anderson Dissects Protest

By JOHN ANDERSON

What is it that motivates so many
young people today? Is it a belief in
a “cause”? Does identification with
a “cause” generate a feeling or sense
of security—even if that cause is an
unpopular one? As a matter of fact,
aren't the major “causes” of today
minority opinions and unpopular
ideals?

Take Vietnam for example. Those
students and young people who are
opposed to the war in that country
are supposedly a minority in their
opinion; and thousands of people
herald to the call for demonstrations
against war. Lately, there has been
a rash of counter-demonstrations by
students and people in general who
back up the President's policy.

Disregarding the issues in them-
selves—the moral, ethical and legal
opinions against the Vietnamese War
or for draft-card burning — the
“cause” is by nature always some
kind of protest. Songs are sometimes
used as a means of expression of
protest; from Joan Baez who may
sing about civil rights or may pro-
test the bomb, to Bob Dylan, who
laments the loss of individuality in
a freakish and complex society, sing-
ers subtly infiltrate the minds of

   
    
   
   
     
   

| generations

, Young people today. This is one way
,in which a young person becomes
aware of the “protest.”

A closer affiliation or empathy
arises if a student or young person
witnesses a demonstration or takes
part in one. There are generally two
types of protesters: the activist and
the sedentary. The activist will take
part in demonstrations and may or
may not go to jail in support of his
convictions. The sedenatary protester
will follow his particular cause—he
usually picks two or more to fol-
low at one time—and is equally ac-
quainted with the arguments sup-
porting it as the activist. Generally,
however, both types do not become
thoroughly versed in their “cause.”

This brings us back to the central
question in which we ask what mo-
tivates the young person today? If
he is not sufficiently acquainted with
the cause he is supporting, why
does he demonstrate, go to jail or
debate the ethies of his country’s
policy? Perhaps the answer lies in
the brief time which has passed since
the Second World War.

For generations men have been
swearing that they will make this
world a better place than it is now
for their children, or then its condi-
tion during their parents’ time: and
for generations men have succeeded
in drawing this country into one war
after another. After the Second
World War, men renewed their
pledges only to fall into the Korean
War. Following that fiasco came

 

-— Suez, Laos and Vietnam

Young people blame the past two
for the various wars
and bombs. In that brief period of
time the next generation sees in their
elders either a warped sense of mor-
al values or a complete lack of un-
derstanding of the major issues or
something in between. As a result,
many students today totally reject
any policy which leads to, supports
or makes use of war. Perhaps this
means a re-evaluation of our na-
tion's major policies. For example,
why is it that the Communists have
been so successful at infiltration?

The really fruitful movement in
art today, he feels, is abstract ex-
pressionism, which is still going
strong in Europe although American
collectors and dealers have tired of
it.

“I don’t ilke this word ‘abstract,’
though,” Prohaska says. “Davis
didn’t either; he hated to be called
an abstract painter. There is no such
thing. The point of painting is to
communicate, and the work of any
good painter should be understood.

Rock And Roll
Songs Praised
As Good Music

By STEVE MILLARD

The following statement is an ac-
tual excerpt from the work of a re-
spected critic, and will appear in my
forthcoming book, Case Histories of
Unemployed Prognosticators:

“Rock and Roll is on the way out
and will be forgotten by the end of
1956.”

Despite the unfortunate fate of this
particular prediction, however, the
big beat was long
regarded by seri-
ous analysts with,
at best, a sort of

 

 

 

pained tolerance.
When a reviewer
with _ scholarly

credentials forced
himself to dwell
on the subject, his
attitude was that
of an evangelist
surveying recent
fluctuations in the

 

we &
Millard

abortion statistics.

All this has changed in the past
year or so. Somehow, rock and roll
became a legitimate subject for criti-
cism on a purely musical basis. This
new posture represents a complete
about-face for many critics, and war-
rants exploration by an interested
but confused audience. One listen-
er’s musings have produced two rea-
sons for this abrupt capitulation:

(1) The continued popularity of the
style—especially as mirrored in a
flourishing family of notorious gyra-
tions—virtually forced the reluctant
critics to re-evaluate their positions.
Typical of this soul-searching are
these recent comments from a for-
merly hostile observer, New York
Times folk critic Robert Shelton:

“To find artistic value in rock and
roll is not ‘capitulating to the tyran-
ny of teenage taste.’ When we, as
folk devotees lose touch with music
the people are making and living by,
we are sowing the seeds of our own
obsolescence and snobbish isolation.”

A further influence is the recogni-
tion that rock no longer appeals
strictly to “teenage taste.” The gen-
eration which accompanied the music
through its infancy is now in its late
twenties—an age at which popular
music fans supposedly discover Tom-
my Dorsey. To the astonishment of
the crystal-ball set, a large percent-
age of these early listeners subborn-
ly refused to “outgrow” the new
sound, and consequently turned the
names of Dorsey, Harry James and
their counterparts into pleasant
anachronisms

(2) A survey of reck and roll over
the past twelve years reveals a vast
overall improvement in the quality
of the music itself. To quote another
convert, jazz eritie Ralph Gleason
has maintained that “Rock record-
ings are a lot more interesting than
the average jazz releases.”

A discussion of the specific musi-
eal developments will provide mater-
ial enough for a separate column.
As a general statement, however, the
trend has ben toward refinement of
music within the limits of its
its essential nature—that is, a strong
family to the Negro
blues. The inclination has been away
from the once-prevalent attempt to
reconcile the big beat and older pop-
ular musica venture which led to
such nonsense as the Bobby Vee-

Yalies Ban Women;
We Welcome Them
For Gridiron Frolic

The administration of august and venerable Yale Univer-
sity decided recently that women add little to football games.
Eight stunning young ladies from Connecticut College for
Women were formally relieved of cheerleading duties after just
one performance at the Yale-Columbia game. Not that the girls

violated in any way traditional New England primness.
after all Yale is the male’s domain.*—— : —

Generals Meet

Why, the Old Blues screamed and
the current Elis were flabergasted.
Apparently, women at Yale are a
new experience.

If Yalies and women don’t mix
all that well, Washington and Lee
men have always found the combi-
nation arresting, in the least. Women
have established themselves as an
integral part of Washington and Lee
life and the W&L Gentleman has
accepted that fact with characteristic
aplomb, not to mention commanding

prowess.
Saturdays at Wilson Field, for
those few who consider football

games an esesntial part of a date’s
itinerary, are brightened by the
freshly scrubbed faces of cheerlead-
ers from Southern Sem. (Yes, Yale
they are females.) Sponsored by the
Varsity Club, the girls sport tradi-
tional W&L blue and white, while
exhorting the football Generals to
victory, a rare commodity these days.

Sem women have inspired W&L
football teams for the past three
years. Annual elections were once
held on campus for cheerleaders, but
when the Varsity Club measured the
power of sex appeal on an athlete’s
performance, Semmies were invited
to lend their bountiful charm.

After securing the approval of
Southern Seminary’s administration,
the Varsity Club wisely left the se-
lection of the cheerleaders to the
girls themselves. Semmies now con-
sider Saturday afternoon vocalizing
at Wilson Field an important main-
stay of extracurricular life.

For each of the Generals’ four
home appearances this year, five
girls and two alternates have made
their way to Lexington. W&L’s foot-
ball team has remained largely un-
responsive thus far, riding a 2-5 rec-
ord, so six girls will cheer this Sat-
urday in the home finale against
Southwestern. They are: Ginny

Lynx In Last
Home Contest

Washington and Lee winds up the
1965 home schedule Saturday against
Southwestern University of Mem-
phis, Tennessee. The Generals will
be looking for their first College Ath-
letie Conference victory of the cur-
rent campaign. W&L goes into Sat-
urday’s game sporting, as the case
may be, an overall record of 2-5.
With a ledger of 0-2 in conference
play, the Generals have two games
remaining, both CAC contests.

Injuries have hurt the Generals
substantially this season. Tackles
Logan Bullitt, Charlie Myers, and
Jim Foley are on the disabled list
along with end Warren Stewart.
Linebacker Joe Miller was injured
in the Sewanee game but should be
ready Saturday.

“This the worst year for in-
juries since I’ve been here,” com-
mented Coach McLaughlin. “Hardly
a week goes by that someone else
doesn’t get hurt.”

is

Southwestern boasts a potent aerial
attack, averaging over thirty throws
per game and completing an impres-
sive 45 per cent of their passes. Lynx
quarterback Bruce Cook had com-
pleted 46 passes for 584 yards going
into last week’s game against Prin-
cipia. He passed for 336 yards to beat
Principia, 27-24. Bill Hendricks, his
principal receiver, can also pass.
Southwestern is a rollout team, but
runs the ball to the outside when
trapped.

According to Tri-Captain Billy
Andrews, “A team that throws that
much can never be counted out. Last

W&L’s corps of Southern Sem cheerleaders exhort the crowd to cheer the Generals. If the Friday sport’s staff
invitation is accepted, they will be joined next year by a band of exiles from Connecticut College for Women,
banished from Yale by a hard-hearted administration. In the meantime, the Semmies above will hold down the
fort at tomorrow’s home game with Southwestern.

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

A great new All-IM party idea—
just in from Indiana University on
the Lexington
Pony Express. It’s
called the Florida
Fling, and this is
how it goes.
| Everybody in

the house, or any
other large group,
puts either $5 or
$10 (determined
by the desired fin-
al amount) into
the pot, and then
gets a date for the
Florida Fling party. The highpoint
of the party is the drawing of a
name from the magic hat. The lucky
guy whose name is drawn wins a
free, all-expense paid weekend in
Florida for himself and for his
date to the party.

Virginia 1-0
In Soccer

The Washington and Lee soccer
team nipped the University of Vir-
ginia’s ensemble Tuesday in Char-
lottesville. Brad Shinkle scored the
game’s only goal, assisted by Allan
Craig.

In a game marred by poor play,
Dave Redmond, Wes Horner, Fred
Skinner, and Richard Burruoughs
did well defensively for the Gen-
erals. Dave Kirkpatrick led W&L’s
offensive efforts with adept dribbling.
Poor timing and poor passing voided
several W&L scoring opportunities,
until Shinkle penetrated the Cavalier
goal in the third period.

The win over U.Va. gave the boot-
ers a second seed for the Virginia

The Virginia game Tuesday ended
the regular season for both teams.
The W&L victory was the first over
Virginia in five years, although the
Generals tied the Cavaliers in last

| year’s state tournament, losing the

match on corner kicks.

The VISA tournament employs a
unique system of determining the
winning team in case of a tie. Two
five minute quarters, both in over-
time, are played. If the game still
remains tied, the team with the most
corner kicks wins. And so Virginia
captured the tourney last year.

faces its biggest job yet. W&L’s pass
defense has improved steadily. Last
Saturday it held Sewanee to a meag-
er 76 yards in the air, picking off two
errant throws.

“The improvement has been due
partly to the addition of Bryant
Kendrick in the backfield and the
way our line has been able to get
to the passer,” said McLaughlin.

This is the seniors’ last game on
Wilson Field, the realization of which
could provide the incentive neces-
sary to make their last home game
a victory. The Generals displayed one
of their best efforts last week against
Sewanee. Hopefully the momentum
will carry over on Saturday.
