Facilities Of
Campus Cited
In Self-Study

By CHRIS MILLS

The open discussion meeting on the
Self-Study Committee’s report on
the campus and its facilities, attend-
ed by seven students, concerned it-
self primarily with the inadequacy
of the University’s shortcomings in
providing adequate drama facilities
for improved productions and ex-
perimentation.

While commenting that the campus
is sufficient in area to accommodate
any “foreseeable expansions,” the
report added that the placement of
buildings west of Washington Hall
was “unfortunate.” The method of
moving traffic into the parking
spaces from Washington Street was
also scored. In discussing parking, the
statement said: “Parking is amply
provided for on campus, but some
of the areas are remote and many
are unpaved.”

“A few classrooms” were cited as
“undesirable, particularly with re-
spect to ventilation and light.” Al-
though stating that the University
“is currently accommodating all
classes at their scheduled times,”
the self-study continued, “There is
a need for greater flexibility in
scheduling, however, particularly in
regard to the use of the so-called
‘undesirable’ class hours of 8:25 and
12:05.” When questioned about the
word “undesirable,” Pollard admit-
ted that, “Some faculty members
really dislike teaching at 8:25 and
12:05 especially the ‘J’ hour.

In an interesting suggestion, the
committee recommended the _ re-
modeling of the Old Freshman Dor-
mitory to accommodate fewer stu-
dents; this would necessitate the
construction of another residence for
freshmen.

Doremus Gymnasium was con-
demned as “inadequate for present
use.” After commenting that plans

are already under way to build an-
other gym, the report said the old
should be kept, “partly because of
the convenience and partly because
of the expense of doing anything
else with it.”

Four Students
Deliver Petition

To Rep. Laird

Four W&L students journeyed to
Washington last Tuesday, March 15,
to present a petition supporting
Vietnam measures to Rep. Melvin R
Laird, (R-Wisconsin).

Representing the Clarence J.
Brown Young Republican Club and
the Washington and Lee Young Re-
publican Club were Raymond J.
Lajeunesse, Jr., Chairman of the
Law School YR club; Kearnons
Whaien Ili.  seeretary-treasurer;
Donald O'Sullivan, program and
planning chairman; and Arthur M.
Love, representative from the under-
graduate club.

The petition which has been cir-
culated throughout the University
contained 406 signatures or roughly
one-third of the student body.

Rep. Laird received the delegation
in his office and later submitted the
petition to the Congressional Record.

Rep. Laird commented in the
Record: “Mr. Speaker, I think it is
significant that the resolution

will be “Batman.”

As was done last year, the cock-
tail party will be held in the back
yard of the Phi Kap house on Fri-
day afternoon. No admission will
be charged for non-fraternity stu-
dents.

“Georgia punch, a very Southern
very traditional-type drink,” which
is a mixture of gin, lemons, limes,
and other unannounced ingredients,
is being planned as_ refreshment in
in effort to match the trend set by
the Fancy Dress Cocktail Party's
mint juleps.

“Our problem is collecting all the
junior dues that are still lacking,”
said Holladay. He estimated that
approximately $200 in dues have not
yet been paid, and that unless these
funds can be collected some of the
plans for the cocktail party will have
to be changed to something less ex-
pensive.

Fontella Bass, who is scheduled to
perform at the party, started her
career at the age of four by singing
and playing the piano in a St. Louis

No Sabotage, ie...

Considering public and private statements made by mem-
bers of the administration and faculty on the decision to with-
draw funds from the Southern Collegian, we must admit that
there was probably no deliberate faculty design to sabotage
the magazine by stealth. Nevertheless, the essential fact re-
mains that in a faculty decision deeply involving student con-
stitution and custom, the student body was taken by surprise.

It is the administration-faculty contention that a self-study
hearing and a brief criticism of the Southern Collegian at the
bottom of the seventh page of a thick report constituted sufh-
cient warning to the student body, and that it was thus not
necessary to seek student opinion in the matter. If the faculty
really believed this, it exhibited an incredible naivete of student
nature,

The self-study report consisted of twelve mimeographed
pages of rhetorical questions and recommendations which was
quietly made available to the students. Considering the heavy
academic and social activities of the students, plus the very
unemphatic nature of the self-study, how many students real-
ized how significant the self-study’s recommendations might
be? Very few indeed, a fact which should have been readily
obvious to self-study, administration, and faculty alike. There-
fore, it is hard to accept that these groups conscientiously be-
lieved the students had been sufficiently warned about the
Collegian issue before the vote was taken.

Either the self-study is out of touch with the students, or it
must have “conveniently overlooked” student unawareness
and the Publications Board’s intention to discuss the Collegian.
The self-study committee should not have presented the Col-
legian proposal without making a similar and simultaneous pro-
posal to the Executive Committee, Publications Board, or both.
And no matter who is to blame for student unawareness, the
student body should never have been taken by surprise on
such an important issue.

With this, we hope to let the unpleasant subject drop,
nevertheless noting that the “Pearl Harbor’ appearance of
the Southern Collegian vote has noticeably created division
and distrust between faculty and students at a time when

W&L hardly needs more dissention. C. W. M.

 

One- Way Communications

If the Southern Collegian controversy has done nothing
else, it has certainly underscored an unfortunate failure of
faculty-student communications at W&L. Had adequate com-
munications existed, the dispute over the Collegian case would
have been limited to the magazine’s value.

The fllow of information on this campus is markedly one-
way. The faculty is kept well-informed on student thought
and planning through the student newspapers, the student
Executive Committee, the LF.C., and other organs of stu-
dent expression. However, the faculty’s opinions and plans
are almost a total enigma to the students. The faculty’s de
pendence on self-study reports and hearings to inform the
students has been a total failure, as the Southern Collegian
case has superabundantly demonstrated.

To prevent misunderstandings between students and
faculty, the faculty should take greater pains to keep the stu-
dents informed. We urge that the self-study committee inves-
tigate this serious problem of communications. Possible ways
of achieving a flow of information from faculty to students
would be: (1) for the faculty to issue periodical statements of
its deliberations on issues affecting the students; (2) for facul-
ty representatives to attend the student E.C. as liaison agents;
or (3) for student representatives or reporters to be admitted
to those parts of faculty meetings which deal with student
affairs.

while that which supported it was
receiving relatively poor response.
It is on this basis that I have chosen
to explore the subject further.

The thesis of anti-Vietnam litera-
ture at W&L has been that we view
Red China as the international “bad-
guy,” when, in reality, is is we who
have the Chinese and Russians en-
circled by missle bases, and it is we
who are fighting on another conti-
nent. In reality, their argument goes,
China and Russia will not start a

Committed to Destroy Us

First of all, the Communists have
openly admitted that they are com-
mitted to the destruction of capital-
ism and capitalist governments the
world over. Was not Marx who
led three revolutionary groups of
laborers in his time, and did he not
advocate revolution the world over?
Was it not Lenin who drew up the
blueprint for world revolution, in-

cluding infiltration of army units
disobedience to the law, allegiance
to Moscow, infiltration of labor un-

ions, and propaganda campaigns?
Was it not Stalin who advocated

operation and then striking at the
opportune moment? Was it not]
Khrushchev who declared that the
United States will be buried (and
he didn't mean just economically)

and that our grandchildren will live
under Communism?

Now the agitators for withdrawal
might say “But these men are not
in power anymore; they are from
an old Russia that no longer exists;
today the Russians want coexist-
ence.” It would be nice if that were
the case, and idealists can’t be
blamed for wanting to believe this.
But I have not heard the current
Soviet or Chinese leadership repu-
diate this philosophy; have you? It
is a dangerous position to assume
that the entire basis for the Com-
munist philosophy has changed in
the last few years. and on top of
that, while the Russians have quieted
down a little, the Chinese are still
screaming. I see no basis for an
assumption that Russia, with a little
more food in its stomach, has chang-
ed its planned course of action; and
without doubt, China hasn’t changed
its.

Changed Philosophy

In summary, it seems that the Com-
munists have not changed their phil-
osophy and are aggressors. No one
is saying that the US. is pure; God
knows we have a national interest
in Vietnam. But who seems to be
starting the trouble?

Again let me emphasize that I
make no claim of being “right.” If

I did, I am sure I would suffer
humiliation at the hands of such
superior writers as Bob Lee and

Nick Ruffin. What I do maintain,
though, is that the above endeavor
(as piecemeal as it may be) does
present a viewpoint worthy of con-
sideration and rational thought.

ZBTs Walk Away = Ast Trivia Title

Faculty And |
Pi Phi Tie
For Second

By CLARK KENT
Mild-Manner Reporter
Superb conditioning and instant
reflexes paid off for ZBT last night
as the duo of Paul Schlesinger and
Charlie Bensinger walked away from
three other teams in the finals of
the first annual Ring-tum  Phi-

Radio W&L Trivia Contest.

The champions scored a total of
275 points to beat out the Faculty
team of Paxton Davis and Frank
Parsons and the Pi Phi entry of
Steve Millard and Rich Johnson,
who each had 150. Finishing in
fourth place was the Kappa Sig
duo, Randy Poore and Dave
Mathewson. They had a _ credible
100 points.

For their victory, the winners re-
ceived a bottle of champagne and the
coveted Jennings Cup, which was
seen and admired by hundreds of
students in the library display case
before the show. Schlesinger also
received a complete selection
last Sunday’s comic sections in rec-
ognition of his being named the
school’s Most Trivial Student.

Second and third prizes were di-
vided between the runners-up. The
Pi Phis got a 1962 Variety and
Avengers comic No. 3, while Parsons
and Davis were awarded a copy of
the Information Please Almanac for
1960 and Metamorpho the Element
Man No. 4.

A special award—The Mr. I. Mag-
ination prize for Original and En-
tertaining Answers—went to the SPE
team of Steve Saunders and Tom
Doss, who enlivened their last place
finish on the prelimiarny quiz with
such responses as “Mauve Candle”
(to “Who was Green Lantern’s side-
kick?”) and “Oneman” (to “What
was One Man's Family's name?”).

The ZBT’s were never headed as
they answered the first two questions
in a row before the faculty broke
into the scoring column by naming
Grace Kelley’s leading men. Their
lead was 35 points with the faculty
in second place, when scorekeeper
Keith Shillington announced the first
running score.

In the second period the winners
broke the opposition’s back, reeling
off several answers in a row to
lead 235 to 100 at the end of the
period. They slumped in the final
third, accumulating only 40 points
while the Phi Phis stageed a strong
comeback, but the meet was al-
ready on ice by that time.

Former Washington and Lee Uni-

versity wrestling coach Archie E.
Mathis, whose teams from 1925 to
| 1942 dominated southern collegian

competion, has been named to the
Helms Athletic Foundation Amateur
Wrestling Hall of Fame.

Mathis who died in 1945, joined
the W&lIL staff in the same year he
was graduated from the University
of Illinois after a brilliant collegiate
wrestling career. Under Mathis’
leadership, the Generals ruled vir-
tually supreme over southern col-
leges and universities, but also put
their record on the line against
schools which had established them-
selves as powers in other regions.

In all, the 17-year Mathis coaching
span produced nine undefeated
teams, 14 winning seasons, one
break-even year, and only two los-
ing campaigns. From 1929 until his
last year at W&L,, Mathis’ wrestlers

F-soxicund Even Writes Trivial Column

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, with epic events occurring
this week on our hill-topped cam-
pus I must resign
myself to sports
and also to intra-
murals,

Not feeling the
urge, I find it hard
to write. Not hav- |
ing the material |
I find it even |
harder. Not having ©
a topic I find it §
impossible. But
the Daily Planet
man se on...
so how about little on

Observations

Texas Western is actually for real,
but I can see them for a second, and
no farther.

The Duke-Kentucky game will
feature two very similar teams, and
the winner should go all the way.

The N.LT. becomes less import-
ant and less prestigeous each year.
Look at the records of the teams
this year, and then remember that
two of them are without their stars

who helped considerably to fashion
what records their teams have.

The Dodgers won’t have a chance
without Koufax and Drysdale, and
will be hurting for a month even
if the Dynamic Duo does sign now,
just because they won't be in shape.

If George Chuvalo beats Clay, then
I can beat Chuvalo...and Clay...
all in the same night.

In All-Virginia Voting

Washington and Lee’s Bob Bauer
and Frank Morrison have just been
honored in the voting for the Vir-
ginia Small College All-State
Basketball Team.

Bauer, who is only a freshman but
led the Generals in scoring with a
15.5 average, was named to the Sec-
ond Team.

Morrison, a junior, was one of the
six selected for Honorable Mention.
Also a forward, Morrison followed
Bauer on the Generals’ attack with
a 126 average, pulling down 5.6
rebounds a game.

Mathis Named To Hall Of Fame

(Continued from page 3)

Among the stronger teams W&L
faced during that time were Frank-
lin & Marshall, Michigan, Michigan
State, Northwestern, Princeton,
Army, Navy, Kansas State, and Tlli-
nois.

Mathis helped inaugurate the first
Southern Conference wrestling tour-
nament in 1930. His teams won four

of the first eight league tourneys,
finished second twice, and third
twice.

1 The Generals, by virtue of their
undefeated record, laid claim to
the Southern Conference title in

five years when no tournament was
held. As much as Mathis did to
promote wrestling among conference
schools, his excellent teams domi-
nated the sport to such an extent
that in several years no tourney
was held for lack of challengers.
Through the reputation of his
wrestling teams and because of his
personal efforts, Mathis was able to
persuade the NCAA to hold its na-
tional championships at W&L in
1936, the first and last time the
NCAA, finals were ever held in the
South. An added feature of the
event was the conduct of semi-final
trials for the Olympic Games sched-

uled later that year in Berlin, Ger-
many.
In 1942, Mathis joined the U. S.

Navy and, after three years of ser-
vice, was discharged. He returned
to the University of Illinois imme-
diately to join the physical educa-
tion staff, and died short time
later.

Mathis is one of seven men chosen
for the Hall of Fame this year and
joins a roster of 86 wrestlers, coach-
es, and contributors to the sport al-
ready honored.

Dick Miller, W&L’s current wrest-
ling coach, will accept the award.

sub-committee is of little import-
ance: the basic complaint remains,
that students were not consulted in
any way by the Self-Study Com-

mittee on Student Life in the mat-
ter of publications.

Hash also said the administration
states that it did not “cut off” dis-
cussion about the Collegian in the
general Self-Study - Student-Life
meeting, but that no one had been
prepared to defend or argue in favor
of the Collegian. The matter, ac-
cording to the Hill, was eligible for
discussion at the time, as indicated
at the bottom of page seven of a
“Summary” released in advance by
the Student Life group, which spoke
of the possibility of withholding the

Hash also pointed out that since
there is no longer a “Student Activi-

Comprehensive Tuition Fee, the Uni-
versity has in effect eliminated the
specific guarantee in the Student
Body Constitution of money for all
publications, but will presumably
continue giving funds to the Student

W&L Challenged
At the present time, Washington

and Lee is being challenged by many
formerly inferior colleges. If they
are improving at a faster rate, they
will surpass us. W&L will be reduced
from a position of good college to
fair college. As a fair college, the
University will not be able to justify
its existence.

The only way for Washington and
