EC Implements
Revised Policy
On Assimilation

By CHRIS MILLS

The Executive Committee voted
at its Tuesday meeting to imple-
ment its new policy of fining vio-
lators of conventional dress “as
soon as possible.” The schedule for
the upcoming Big Four elections was
again discussed, and an open meeting
for the candidates to express their
views before the student body was
slated for Tuesday, April 12, at 7
p.m. (See election story on page one
for complete details.)

In contrast to the disagreement
which plagued the committee when
imposition of fines was approved the
membership agreed unanimously that
no further delay should occur be-
fore the Assimilation Committee
should start to employ its new pow-
ers. Bob Lee, a vociferous opponent
~\of enforcement of the tradition, made
the motion te begin enforcement,
and the committee also voted to eall
the chairman and the two secretaries
of the Assimilation Committee be-
fore the EC next Tuesday for a con-
ference on what will be expected of
the three officers and the other
Committee members.

In voting to implement the sched-
ule of fines this year, the EC ex-
pressed the opinion that if a decision

Chuck Jackson...

By KAZ HERCHOLD

Springs Weekend president Mike
Saunders has announced that the
signing of Chuck Jackson and his
All-Star Revue to perform at the
Saturday concert, April 16, com-
pletes the Springs lineup of enter-
tainment.

Jackson's appearance this month
is a re-scheduling of his planned
Openings concert in October, which
had to be cancelled when the star
entered a hospital because of tooth
trouble.

As a performer, Chuck Jackson is
considered to be at the “top of the
top” in rhythm-and-blues-and-rock-
and-roll, on a par with Chuck Berry
and James Brown. He has played

at most eastern and nothern col-
leges.
“His...is the sound of a man

King, jockel for WOOK in Wash-

Dance Board vice-president Tom-

my Cox has urged all members of |

the junior class to pay their class
dues as soon as possible. If these
are not paid immediately, he said,
the supply of liquor at the cocktail
party may be seriously limited.

Both concerts will begin at 8:10
p.m. Both will be held in Doremus
Gymnasium. According to Dance
Board president Jim Crothers, there
will be no admission to either con-
cert except by Dance Plan or by
advance-sale tickets. Tickets for
non-Dance Plan holders are now on
sales at the Co-op: $8 for non-dance
plan holders and for out-of-town
guests, $5 if purchased by a student
who holds a Dance Plan.

The primary elections for the of-
fices of President, Vice-President,
and Secretary of the Student Body,
plus President of Fancy Dress, will
be held this Wednesday in the first
Big Four election conducted without
political parties in almost twenty
years. Nominations will be made by
petitions of at least 150 signatures,
which must be given to Secretary
Joe Framptom by 6 p.m. on Monday

On Tuesday at 7 p.m., there will
be an open meeting of the student
body in the Commons to allow can-
didates to state their opinions and
intentions. On Wednesday, April 13,
the primary election will be held to
reduce the number of nominees for
each office to two; however, no pri-
mary will be held for offices where
no more than two men have filed
petitions. All four classes of the un-
dergraduate student body and the
law school students are eligible to
vote.

 

The final election for the Big Four
positions will be on Monday, April
18, and presumably the five days be-
tween the primary and the election
will serve for campaigning. The elec-
tion procedure has been greatly
changed from that of previous years,
when no primaries were held and
nominations were made by party
cliques.

Class Elections

The class elections, to be held
later, will be similar in procedure
to the Big Four elections. Class
officers will consist of Vice-Presi-
dent, the offices of class secretary
and class historian having been elim-
inated. The rising-senior class will
elect three vice-presidents, one each

 

E.C. Requests Nominations
For Annual Gilliam Award
For Valuable Contributions

The Executive Committee is seek-
ing letters nominating students for
the Dean Frank A. Gilliam Award.
Any student currently enrolled in
the University is eligible for the
award and nominations may be made
by students and faculty members.

The recipient of this award must
have made a valuable contribution
to student affairs. This contribution
might take the form of outstanding
work in one field or in numerous
fields. It shall not be necessary that
the recipient have held any partic-
ular office or position, or that his
contribution be made through an
organization.

Nominating letters should be mail-
ed to Box 9, Lexington or given to
Jerry Turner, Bob Lee, or Joe
Framptom. All letters should be in
by Friday, April 15

 

Candidates’ Petitions
Due Monday Night

for commerce, liberal arts, and

sciences,

Nominations for class offices will
also made by petition, 50 signa-
tures being required. Students may
sign more than one petition. Nom-
inating petitions for class officers
must be submitted to Secretary
Frampton before 6 p.m. on Monday,
April 25. A primary will be held on
Wednesday to narrow the field of
candidates to two in the class offices
and three for the Executive Commit-
tee positions, and the general class
elections will be on Monday, May 2.

The law school elections will be
held entirely on the night of May 2,
and will determine the selection of
class officers and two EC represen-
tatives.

Commenting on the new election
establishment, President Fred Min-
del said, “Compared with previous
elections, the new election procedure
is extremely fair and equitable. It
gives any interested student a chance
to run for office, but at the same
time, the primary will reduce the
selection to the two most serious
contenders for each office. For the
first time in years, W&L will have
a major election which is free, open,
and run solely by the students.”

 

Biostratigraphy
Conceptualized

On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednes-
day of next week, Dr. Earle G.
Kauffman of the United States Na-
tional Museum will be at W&lL to
speak as a guest of the Geology De-
Dr.

partment. Kauffman is an as-
sociate curator with the Division of
Invertebrate Paleontology, Smith-

sonian Institution. He is, however, a
research geologist rather than strict-
ly a director of the Museum.

Dr. Kauffman will give three talks,
open to all students and the public.
On Monday afternoon at 2:30 in
Howe 206, he will discuss the “Evo-
lution of Fossil Shellfish.” On Tues-
day at 2:30 pm., he will talk on
“The Living Environments of Fossil
Moliuses,” also in Howe 206.

Finally, on Wednesday morning
at 10:15, Dr. Kaufiman will speak
on “Cretaceous Biostratigraphy,
Paleoecology, and Sedimentary His-
tory of the Southern Rocky Moun-
tains.” At other times, Dr. Kauffman
will be available for discussion with
interested students and professors.

Kauffman's visit to W&L is spon-
sored by the American Geological
Institute's visiting scientists program,
and this is the seventh year that
the program has brought scientists
to W&L. On Thursday, Dr. Kauff-

 

man goes on to William and Mary

Mid-Semester Lamentations

Enormous herds of naked souls I saw,
lamenting till their eyes were burned of tears;
they seemed condemned by an unequal law...

The Inferno, Canto XIV, 13-18

Dante, of course, was referring to the dead in hell. But the
description wouldn’t be a bad one for the average W&L stu-
dent’s reaction to mid-semester grades, which have once more
indicated that among other hallowed traditions at W&L there
is one which states that mid-semester grades of second semester
must be at least one grade point below the grades of any other
period. It’s no surprise that the lament goes up that the stu-
dent body was somewhere, somehow, “condemned by an un-
equal law.”

If ever there was a problem, it’s how to explain away that
unpleasant row of figures unfeelingly stamped by the IBM
on your white “Student’s Copy”—which is the IBM’s way
of letting you know that there are plenty more of these things
floating around for the enjoyment of your parents, friends
and professors. (Furthermore, we have always felt that the
title of the column marked SEMESTER HOURS AT-
TEMPTED is unnecessarily cute, if not downright insulting) .

So, the lamenting turns into shrieks of anguish as the
students discover that the product of six week’s hard labor
has turned out once again to be (shall we say) less than en-
couraging. In vain were all the desperate all-nighters, in vain
the endless lists of possible ID's (“he couldn’t ask that one”),
the cold quizzes, the helpful hints of the College Outline
Series; in vain the frantic infighting for class participation
points. There you are, right back where you were last semster
(or lower), when Dad said that if you didn’t bring up those
grades....

You can’t help but wonder.

It it worth it?

Everybody has heard the stories, (most of them true),
about boys who leave W&L because the academic demands
were so great that they no longer felt they could put up with
them, day in and day out, with nothing to show for it but a
steadily-plunging GPR; and about how they then entered an-
other college, made Dean’s List, and graduated in the upper
tenth of their class. And all the stories say the same: the student
did all this with the same amount of effort that he had put
out unsuccessfully at W&L—the same amount of effort you’re
putting out.

What's more, always lurking in the background is The
Draft. The latest government move has been to issue directives
to all draft boards that they may begin taking students in the
bottom half of the freshman class, the bottom third of the
sophomore class, and the bottom fourth of the junior class,
unless they can score a 70 on the standard test to be given
next month. Dean Atwood assured us that no W&L student
should have any difficulty making a 70 or above on the stand-
ard test. This may be true; however, with the draft boards
casting ever-hungrier eyes on what has been called “the largest
untapped reservoir of manpower in the U.S.,” class standings
can only gain, not lose, in importance. The standard test may
be out of date within two years, and the temptation to draft
boards to use grades as a standard will become greater.

Or supposing that the average W&L student, by means of
heroic efforts, maintains an overall standing sufficient to keep
him in school long enough to graduate. Sooner or later, he'll
enter that inevitable plush office for the inevitable and all-
important first job interview. Competing with him for the same
position will be the graduate of City College—a good school,
but one which doesn’t call for undue academic performances
from its students. He has a B average. The employer calls
our W&L graduate in. (Excuse me, sir, that’s Washington
and Lee, not William and M—yes, I know there’s a high school
by that name in D.C... . No, I went to the university.) Alas,
one glance at his academic record—call it a 1.2—and the
W&L student loses out.

That’s chat. Its not worth it. Right?

Wrong.

Wrong, because when we came here it was not to look for
any A that could be had for the taking. Wrong, because when
we came here it was not to dodge the draft. Wrong, because
when we came here we knew we were coming to a school
whose graduates were not snapped up by big business because
of the letter on their sweater pocket. We came to a school
which demanded much in the way of sacrifice, time, and some-
times self-esteem; which offered little in the way of status,
easy marks, or the promise of a good job and good pay
after graduation. All it offered was an education and a train-
ing that in the end would stand us in better stead than any-
thing City College, for all its advantages, could offer.

And when you think about it, that’s quite a lot.

improvement over them only in the
unusually high caliber of its “big-

elected in the spring balloting.

But the 1964 spring elections pro-

two years is essential to under-

gressive Party defeat, plus a tied

Formal Parties

Ever since the late 1940’s, nomi-
nations of candidates had been
made by two formal political par-
ties, the University Party and the
Independent Party. However, these
parties were organized as fraternity
groups rather than opinion groups,
and the University Party consisted
of the nine (sometimes ten) largest
fraternity houses. The U.P. invari-
ably won every election, clean-
sweeping several and its candidates
were usually invincible. Party loyal-
ty was maintained on the spurious
contention that non-party voting was
a betrayal of one’s fraternity; as late
as 1962, freshmen were threatened
with black-balling for “disloyal”
talking or voting. Unfortunately
these coercive methods were gener-
ally effective.

But the most obnoxious feature
of pre-1964 campus politics was the
clique nominating system. Party
candidates for office were selected
in secret session by party cliques
consisting of one voting member
from each house in the party. These
cliques were entirely out of control
of the constitutent fraternity mem-
bers and usually selected candidates
on the giving each house
its turn for power and rush week
influence. The nomination of real
leaders was incidental to fraternity
ambition. Furthermore, in many
houses, the clique representative
was not even elected by the members
but appointed by his predecessor.

clique that the gravy train was gone
for good. After some secret bargain-
ing on the eve of Mock Convention,
clique members of ten of the stronger |
houses devised the “Liberty Party,”
dissolving both the University Party
and the Progressive Party.
Disgust and Opposition

Disgust and opposition to the
manipulation of the students and
fraternities by the cliques and cam-
pus bosses had been mounting
steadily during this period of politi-
cal unrest. Now, the cynical and
covert formation of the Liberty Party
as the new “big clique” brought the
opposition to a head, and the day
after the L.P. was announced, Sigma
Chi declared its intention to remain
independent of all parties and
cliques, establishing a precedent.

The sabotaged Progressive Party

Phi Psi, and ZBT—but Phi Ep, DU,

But neither party was to survive
an election. Just before the fall
election, a final clique maneuver
placed Beta, KA, Phi Delt, PiKA,
SAE, Phi Gam, SPE, Delt, and Kap-
pa Sig in a new “big clique,” ap-
propriately named “University Par-
ty” after its defunct predecessor.

The remaining nine houses held an
open meeting on the day that the
latest coalition was disclosed and
agreed to eschew any party or clique
organizations, hoping to end clique
rule once and for all by holding free
and open nominations. Nevertheless,
the University Party candidate won
the freshman E.C, election.

In the spring, 1965, a constitutional
amendment which would reform the
party system failed in a student
referendum, and on April 9, the
University Party clique nominated

This suggestion, while compara-
tively minor in nature, exemplifies
the spirit of innovation and progress
which is needed so badly at this
university. In one bold stroke, it
would focus national attention on
W&L; improve town relations by
bringing additional tourists to Lex-
ington; and foster knowledge of
and respect for our traditions among
the student body

What I am proposing is that the
university take steps to have the
Troubadour Theater declared a Na-
tional Historical Monument,

it may The build-
ing has a long fascinating history,

Improving Stickmen
Fall to Denison, 8-3

By RON KESSLER

Reeking with inexperience and in-
consistency, the Washington and Lee
Lacrosse Team lost its fourth official
game Thursday to Denison Univer-
sity, 8-3.

Although the team as a whole
seemed improved since their last
home game before vacation, Denison
proved to be too strong and too
quick. The Generals were Denison’s
third victim of the week, defeating
University of North Carolina, 11-4,
and Duke, 18-6.

On the asset side of the score
sheet, W&L played a good tight
defense. Goalie Dave Johnson played

Hampden-Sydney Scores
Heavily In Field Events;
General Trackmen Beaten

The W&L track team was defeated
yesterday by the Tigers of Hampden-
Sydney, 74-62 in what proved to
be one of the most hotly contested
meets of the season.

Competing at Farmville, the Gen-
erals took first place honors in seven
of the ten running events but falter-
ed in field competition.

Bill Wildrick, Wes Murfin, and
Moby Dowler swept the 880 yard
run. Bob Stack nabbed first in the
mile while co-captain Jim Thomp-
son triumphed in the 440 yard dash.
In the 220 freshman Pat Howell
seored a victory.

Other first place points were scored
by junior letterman Jeff Kugel in
the 440 yard intermediate hurdles
and by co-captain Lee Johnson, in
the two-mile run. Kugel also gained
second place honors in the high
hurdles. The meet was climaxed by
the success of the mile relay team
composed of Murfin, Wildrick,
Thompson, and Rick Meiser.

In the field events the Generals
placed in the shot-put, second and
third; the discus, third; the triple
jump, third; the pole vault, second
and third; and the broad jump,
third

Coach Norman Lord’s comments
on the meet were: “If we could have
gotten two more seconds we would
have won the meet. Getting licked
by Hampden-Sydney is going to
make us a better team. It is the first
time they have beaten us since 1959
and I think this will eause the boys
to work harder. With hard work
Il think we ean develop into a win-

ning lt

um.”

a tremendous game, “officially” sav-
ing eleven (although by most counts
it was at least sixteen).

Denison led throughout the game,
scoring one the first quarter and two
the second to W&L’s none. The Gen-
erals finally broke the ice in the
opening minutes of the second half
with goals by Chip Chew and Bruce
Jackson. Denison proceeded to score
four in the third period and one
in the fourth. Chew scored his sec-
ond and W&L’s final goal with 3:36
to play in the game.

Statistic-wise, the Generals looked
better. W&L picked up 36 ground
balls to Denison’s 28. Denison shot
8 for 40, Washington and Lee 3 for
19. In extra man opportunities, W&L
was 1 for 2, Denison 3 for 8. The
Generals scored no goals in five fast

breaks, while Denison scored one
in four.
Coach Dana Swan extolled the

team’s efforts against a better team,
claiming “there was no question
that Denison is better. Considering
that Denison has been either co-
champion or champion of the Mid-
West Conference since it was organ-
ized, I'd say our guys really battled
them. Warren Stewart and Lance
Bendann did fine jobs on defense,
and Dave Johnson performed excel-
lently as goalie. We've had trouble
scoring all year long, but we look
a little better in some area each
game.”

Over vacation, the squad traveled
north to New York and Pennsyl-
vania. the Generals were defeated
11-3 by a very strong Hofstra Col-
lege. The game, according to Coach
Swan, was an “accurate reflection”
of the two teams’ comparative abil-
ities. Against Penn State, W&L
showed improvement in an unofficial
game, losing in the midst of a bliz-
zard, 9-5.

The squad tallied its first win of
the season against Villanova April
5, 9-8. Last year, a stronger squad
lost to the Villanova club 8-1. As
a whole, Coach Swan asserted that
the trip “served its purpose.”

Next Saturday the Generals play
their first conference game of the
season against Carolina.

Bensinger Writes About Tax, Dodgers

By CHARLIE BENSINGER

Dear Mom and Dad,

And I thought that there was
nothing to write about last week.
If this place gets
any more lively I |)
just won’t be able
to stand it.

Don’t ever let |
anyone tell you |
that we at Wash- |
ington and Lee
are behind the

baseball
teams in the coun-
try have all play-
ed 15 or more
games and we haven't even started,
but we'll catch up. After all, the
Majors haven't started yet either.

 

Bensinger

Speaking of the majors, now that
Sandy and Don have signed, the
Dodgers are the favorites again. Be-
fore the two put their names on the
line the Giants were favored to edge
the Dodgers (who probably would
have had Alston and his wife pitch-
ing for them), but now the odds
have been reversed.

Some said that Koufax was crazy
to team up with Drysdale in 50-50
negotiations, but his old contract
would have been for $105,000 and
his half of the new one is $115,000.
Not bad for a guy would could last
five innings five years ago.

that an ideological division already

that needs only to be organized to

was once the scene of the barbaric
initiation rites of a primitive tribe
which once flourished in this vicinity.
The foolhardy novices were induced
to climb down a steel ladder and
make their way into the midst of a
jungle of exposed electrical wiring,
where they remained for periods up
to three hours.

As if this were not dangerous
enough, the candidates for member-
ship were also menaced by a large
sprinkler faucet directly before their
faces, which might go off at any time.

Humane legislation has of course
erased the last vestiges of this prac-
tice by now, but the spot should
remain an outstanding attraction to
visitors—as witness the appeal pos-
sessed by the Aztec altars of human
sacrifice, the Well of Chichen Itza,

of exploiting this attraction would
be to keep the more daring guests |

be willing to pay 50 cents for a
