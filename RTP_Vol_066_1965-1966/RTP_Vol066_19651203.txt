Preliminary Self-Study Report To Be Made Public

 

 

E C Considers M embership
In Nat. Student Association

The EC has taken under consider-
ation a proposal made by President
Fred Mindel that W&L become a
member school of the United States
National Student Association.

The NSA, founded in 1947, is a
confederation of 310 university stu-
dent governments to help deal with
problems arising from increasing
college enrollments, educational
standards, academic freedom, inter-
national student understanding and
cooperation, and community service.

In addition to being the largest
national college student organization
in America, the NSA is also the only
college group which is a voting
member of the American Council on
Education.

Each summer delegates from each
school meet in a National Student
Congress. Through seminars, com-
mittees, and legislative plenary ses-
sions, an attempt is made to propose
policies of value to American stu-
dents, largely concerning campus
problems, but also including state-
ments on international issues.

Reve Medieval
Religious Work
To Be Shown

The only colored slides in ex-
istence of a rare 13th century mas-
terpiece will be shown here Monday.

Dr. John Esten Keller, professor of
Spanish at the University of North
Carolina, will show the slides and
lecture on them at 8:15 p.m. in
duPont Auditorium.

Dr. Keller is the only man ever
given permission to make photo-
graphic copies of the rare book,
“Canticles of Our Lady,” a collee-
tion of poetic hymns illustrated with
full-page colored miniatures. The

 

book composed during the reign of

 

‘Sdier s

Spanish King Alfonso X in the 13th
eentury and new in a Spanish mu-
seum, gives a unique composite view
of medieval life

Students ol regard the beau-
tiful illustrations as valuable works
of art for the period; musicologists
see the songs as a significant musi-
development; and students of
eomparative literature leok to the
eanticles as a rich source of mediev-
al themes

cerning the problems experienced on
various campuses and the manner in
which these problems were met.

International Student ID Card,
which allows American students in
28 countries to obtain special dis-
counts, can be obtained by students
at member schools at a lower price
than is ordinarily possible.

Publications are available concern-
ing student community involvement,
student rights and fredoms, higher
education in general, and other stu-
dent government affairs.

Conferences are held on a region-
al level, in addition to the annual
Congress. There are further confer-
ences for editors, students body pres-
idents, and NSA coordinators.

Cost to member schools is $15 per
year.

The NSA has been praised by
numerous national leaders, includ-
ing Presidents Johnson, Kennedy,
and Eisenhower; Vice-presidents
Nixon and Humphrey; and others.

Mindel emphasizes the advantages
which W&L could obtain from mem-
bership in the NSA, “especially the
valuable support it would give to
the student government in research”;
for example, in studying the exper-
iences of other universities changing
from a six- to five-day schedule.

He added that membership would
provide W&L with an opportunity
to have a voice in the formation of
the policies of an organization to
which a great number of American
universities belong.

No action was taken on voting to
join the association, pending further
investigation by BC members.

Editor Canham Discusses
6 World-Changing Ideas

One of America’s most distin-
guished speaker, Erwin D. Canham,
delivered a talk on “Who Is Win-
ning the World-Wide Struggle for
the Minds of Men?” to a large and
receptive audience Tuesday evening
in Reid Hall.

Mr. Canham is the editor of the
Christian Science Monitor, which
ranks among this country’s most re-
spected newspapers; he is past pres-
ident of the American Association
of Newspaper Editors and of the
Chambers of Commerce of the
United States, and is an alternate
delegate to the General Assembly
in the United Nations.

In his remarks, Canham com-
mented that he does not believe
that any one nation or ideology
should dominate the minds of men,
and that none does. Instead, ideas
are ‘winning’ the struggle. He set
forth six of the most significant
of these ideas and spoke of their
relationship to the inevitable changes
going on in the world today.

First in contemporary importance,
he said, is the concept of National-
ism. This desire for nationhood, na-
tional self-government, overrides
any single struggle of political theor-
ies. Nationalism is presently trium-

Professor Sponsors Petition
Supporting Action In Vietnam

Prompted by a call from 100 prom-
inent Americans for positive message
of support for the Government's
policy in Vitnam, political science
professor Martin Merson has pre-
sented to the faculty and students a
petition for them to sign “as individ-
uals, not as representative of Wash-
ington and Lee,” according to Mer-
son.

Alter the giant demonstration in
front of the White House last Sun-
day, such public figures as Dean
Rusk and Thurston Morton said that
the people of America should ex-
press their support for the govern-

ment, not a Democratic administra-
tion, by signing the petition which
they presented. Professor Merson

copied this draft verbatim. It reads

“We the undersigned, students of
Washington and Lee, do hereby de-
elare that:

We as Americans renew our dedi-
eation to the achievement of peace
with freedom. To this end, we de-
our support of the American
Vietnam, and
whatever national
required shall be
voted to its fulfillment.”

and in Europe (especially in France),
but it does not solve all problems;
nationalism need not be the end of
political organization.

Rebellion is the second important
idea, and is likewise triumphant to-
day. The revolution of the colonies
against England has been imitated
ever since—even Rhodesia, Mr. Can-
ham observed, today quotes princi-
ples first set forth in Virginia.

Third is the idea of Federalism,
atempts at which are being made
(not successfully as of now) in Eu-
rope. In this country, federalism is
seen in the union of the States; in
other nations, regional agreements,
especially such as the Common Mar-
ket, are evidence of the significance
of Federalism.

“Perfectability” in its seventeenth-
century New England meaning is
another great concept—the idea that
man’s lot can be dramatically im-
proved through technological ad-
vances. Science transcends ideology,
Canham stated: “There are no labels
on knowledge.”

Also consequential is the accept-
ance of those ideas of communica-
tion which are particularly suited
to our way of life. Transitor radios,
for example, are teaching African
natives who have never had con-
tact with civilization. Along this
line, Canham remarked that he dis-
agrees with Marshall McLuhan’s
contention that the printed word is
today losing its significance, that “the
word is here to stay.”

A sixth important idea today is
that of American culture and its ef-
fects as it encompasses the world.
This culture is itself composed of
many strange combinations of ideas
from many strange sources, but it
has had a remarkable effect on other
societies. Mr. Canham recalled that
in Moscow's Lenin Day parade of
a few years ago, a small combo of
Russians was heard playing “When
the Saints Go Marching In.”

The United States it net ‘winning’
the struggle for the minds of men
but neither is Russia, nor China, nor

deGaulle. “No one dominates the
world in which we live and into
which we are moving. Nothing is

guaranteed except the certainty of
change. We must be everlastingly re-
sponsive to such change.”

By KAZ HERCHOLD

Dr. John H. Wise, analyst for the
self-study program of the College
of Arts and Sciences, has announced
that the preliminary report of the
Self-Study Committee on the Col-
lege will be presented to the faculty
and students early next week.

Dr. Wise will hold open discus-
sions on the forthcoming summary of
compiled self-study material with
faculty members in Newcomb 8,
Tuesday, December 7. at 7:30 p.m.
He will meet with interested stu-
dents on Wednesday, December 8,
also in Newcomb 8, at 2:30 and at
7:30 p.m.

General areas of consideration
include objectives of the College, its
students, curriculum. special pro-
grams, and research possibilities. The
report is expected to pose questions
and suggest a number of recom-
mendations, under study at the pres-
ent time.

Specific topics within the objec-
tives portion of the program of the
College encompass admission poli-
cy, orientation procedure, increase
in independent work, and the en-
couragement of fuller integration of
the social and academic spheres. In
regard to students a variety of ques-
tions about the Automatic Rule and
penalties, departmental fluctuations,
enrollment in various departments,
and attrition rates make up a part
of what is being examined. Profes-
sor Wise will discuss degree pro-
grams and the question of accuracy
and merit of the current grading
system. In addition, other aspects
of the curriculum such as course
offerings, the Honors program, and
comprehensive examinations for ex-
ample will receive attention. The re-

 

Troubadour Auditions
For Second Production
Set For Next Tuesday

Auditions will be held next Tues-
day, Dec. 7, for the Troubadours’
second production of the 1965-66
season, Shapkespeare’s Richard HI.

Like the readings for Waiting for
Godot, auditions for the show will
be in two parts, one from 4 to 5
p.m. and the second from 7 to 9.
Mr. Lee Kahn, director of the
Troubadours, urged all interested to
attend both sessions if possible “so
that I can get as good an idea as
possible of what you can do.”

There are 25 male roles to be cast
in Richard H. Kahn emphasized that
as the play will not be presented
until Mareh 2-5, it will not be nec-
essary to begin rehearsals until
alter exams.

Scripts for the play are now avail-
able in Mr. Kahn's office at the
theater. Anyone interested in trying
for a part is invited to check out
a copy to study.

port shall also deal with the ques-
tion of greater cooperation with
VMI, and some of the other special
programs conducted under the au-
spices of the University. Research
opportunities and the concomitant
sources of support constitute yet
another area of consideration. More
specifically, the self-study report ex-
amines faculty leaves of absence and
travel for the purpose of continued
study, the Robert E. Lee Research
Program now available to students,
and student success in obtaining
prestigious fellowships. Lastly, the
report will undertake the Universi-
ty’s role in the realm of community
service, namely “town-gown” rela-
tions and cooperation with area sec-
ondary schools.

The summary of material consider-
ed which will be released next week
is by no means the final, definite
statement of the Self-Study Com-
mittee. In many cases, the subject
matter discussed shall be assigned to
subcommittees for further study.

Professor Wise has announced that
if, to cover fully the subject matter,
more meetings than those already
scheduled become necessary, such
meetings shall be arranged.

 

 

Debaters Face
Tough Contest
At Georgetown

The Washington and Lee debate
team gained further acclaim over
the Thanksgiving holidays, this time
at the Georgetown Invitational Tour-
nament. Each of the two squads
which participated compiled 6 and
2 records at this, by far the most
competitive meet of the semester. It
was the best record ever recorded
by W&L at this well-known con-
test.

George Dover and Chris Mills on
one squad, and Tom Baremore and
Hal Higginbotham on the other faced
some of the toughest competition
from among the 138 teams from 100
universities in the U.S. and Canada
that participated. In addition to the
East Coast powers, units from U.S.C.
U.L.C.A., Nevada, the U. of Chicago,
and the University of Houston
traveled to Washington to compete
for the honors ultimately won by
Dartmouth College.

This weekend two more units from
Washington and Lee are competing
at another meet. Director of For-
ensics William W. Chaffin took four
freshmen to the N.Y.U. (Uptown)
Hall of Fame Tournament in New
York City. Harry Zeliff and Paul
Prince on the affirmative and Kirk
Woodward and Bill Christie on the

 

negative will face competition from
_ forty schools across the US.

Housemanagers’ Committee

Last Spring, the Housemanagers’ Association announced its
disbandment because the group’s major task had become send-
ing out post cards announcing the meetings. Originally organ-
ized to attack an ambitions program of cooperative food buy-
ing, the Association had degenerated to a collective center for
checks all fraternities had to pay for services such as Orkin,
summer lawn trimmings, and fix extinguisher refills.

These functions, not earth-shattering in scope, had to be
performed by someone. The IFC seemed the logical choice
and the body accepted the defunct association. At that time
many people on the IFC felt the new appendage would be a
stagnant committee whose chairman would be saddled with
the responsibility of collecting checks.

Roger Milam, the committee’s chairman, has changed that
preconception. The committee is now in the process of collect-
ing information about fraternity insurance coverage for houses,
housemothers and other employees. The result of this study
may be better coverage for all these groups as lower premiums
for each fraternity. And this is the first in a long line of projects

now on the drawing boards.

Milam and his committee are to be congratulated on the
foresight and energy which have revived the House Managers’

Committee.

 

The Washington March

 

Vietniks in the Afternoon!

By STEVE MILLARD

At first glance, it was not unlike
a thousand other Saturday mornings
in the nation’s capital.

Mothers dragged their reluctant
offspring across Memorial Bridge in
search of the perfect shoe sale. Teen-
agers filed out of the record shops
and headed for nearby lunch count-
ers, where traffic in hot turkey sand-
wiches was less than brisk on this
particular weekend. The unfortunate
few who owed an extra day to the
government had only the relative
absence of rush hour to console
them. A town crier surveying the
scene would have been quick to
proclaim that “all is well,” to which
Washingtonians would have readily
assented.

In the heart of all this good cheer
a crowd was gathered, armed with
signs and intense expressions and
determination to convince their con-
tented neighbors that all was in fact
far from well. On Pennsylvania
Avenue the cluster of people gradu-
ally became a long line, moving by
a tortuous path toward its destina-
tion at the Washington Monument.
As the first regiment moved out, re-
inforcements arrived to grab their
banners and join the ranks of the
saving remnant.

Thus began the March on Wash-
ington for Peace in Vietnam—gran-
daddy of all the endless outbursts
designed to “awaken the American
conscience to his needless slaught-
er.” At the day's end, when the
marchers finished their task and
turned in their signs, there was lit-
tle evidence that their efforts—which
one leader described as a “huge suc-
cess”——had proeduced anything be-
yond 50,000 weary legs and one
rather harried police force.

Still, it seemed that only outsiders
shared this view. The vast majority
of the non-violent warriors ex-
uded a supreme faith in the merit
and potential influence of their cru-
sade.

Standing across the street from the
White House, I watched a well-oiled
machine begin to function. Parading
by was a motley assemblage of
bearded students, distraught house-
wives, and reformed veterans. At
this point, my curiosity got the bet-
ter of me; I stepped into the group
and shuffled off down the street.

My hopes of picking up bits and
pieces of conversation remained fu-

 

tile as long as the line kept moving.
It was a far cry from the civil rights
march of two summers ago, when
spontaneity and singing voices ruled
the day. Isolated efforts to inject
music into the proceedings died al-
most before they began. The march-
ers seemed to rely upon sheer num-
bers to impress the world with their
concern.

However, the picture changed as
the procession neared its assigned
goal. Across from the Monument, a
huge circle of marchers slowly took
shape. As new faces arrived, they
held fast to one spot until the march
became a stationary object com-
posed of 25,000 people.

Here, as people rested and un-
packed their lunches, a different
world emerged. Where they had
previously walked in the traffic of
a large city, the faithful were now
solely among friends.

I covered the circumference of the
group, wondering what might be
their personal reactions. One young
student was concerned because “the
mood of this march is just too mod-
erate. We should all be telling them
to get the hell out of Vietnam.” A
mother walked wearily up to a mar-
shal, wondering what was planned
for the remainder of the march.
“Speeches at 2:00,” she was informed
eurtly. The prospect obviously struck
her as distinetly unexciting.

Conversations inevitably turned
to other topics. Two middle-aged
marchers enthusiastically debated
the relative merits of their respec-
tive psychoanalysts. Another ex-
plained to a bystander his preference
for the health foods which occupied
his lunchbag. The diet apparently
hadn't accomplished much.

One marcher, obviously a prime
mover in some organization, col-
lared a northern student to discuss
“research teams.” “We organize
groups in every major city,” he ex-
plained, “to find out who our targets
are—who might help us carry the
ball.” As a postscript, he added,
“We're having a meeting tonight at
the Sheridan Hotel. Do drop by.” The
whole conversation suggested a
working knowledge of social science
tinged with a dash of Madison Av-
enue. Somebody knew his stuff
rather well

At the Monument, a few singers
broke their silence to offer a fragile

One of the best ideas to come out
of W&L in recent years, CONTACT,
moved another step toward success
today when ten noted authorities
on the problems of urban areas were
invited to speak at the second an-
nual weekend symposium, Febru-
ary 10, 11, and 12. The prospective
lecturers were selected for their
knowledge of this year’s topic under
discussion, “The City.”

Co-chairman Roger Sennott and
Phil Claxton released the names of
the experts who were asked to de-
liver speeches and conferences for
the three-day event:

Wolf Von Eckhart, the architecture
critic for the Washington Post.

Aline Saarinen, wife of the late
architect Eero Saarinen and com-
mentator for NBC.

 

Harvey Cox, theologian and au-
thor of Secular City,

Morton G. White, Professor of
Philosophy at Harvard, and author
of The Intellectual vs. the City.

Paul Goodman, author of Growing
Up, Absurd, and Communitas.

Michael Harrington, author of The
Other America, and The Accidental
Century.

Kenneth Clark, author of Dark
Ghetto, and a psychologist at the
City College of New York.

Claude Brown, author of Man-
child in the Promised Land.

William Stringfellow, a lawyer in
Harlem.

Mayor of the City of New York.

 

Hartin Sees Liberals as Discontented

 

 

 

By LIN HARTIN
It is rather difficult to believe that
Lyndon Johnson has been president
for only two years.
The days of John
F. Kennedy seem
to be a memory
out of a distant
past and about as
closely connected
with the Johnson
administration as
is that of Millard
Fillmore.

The memory of
the late president
is, to be sure, very
much alive. Books about him have
been pouring forth this year. Monu-
ments have been going up all over
the world. The late President was
universally admired and respected.
His widow has become the symbol
of heroic courage. His brothers have
devoted followings if for no other
reason because of the magic of their
name.

More than this, most people have a
very personal memory of the late
president. For some he is intimately
connected with a certain period of
their own lives. Indeed, for those
three years there was a spirit, “that
special grace,” that seemed to af-
fect the whole nation.

Why is the situation so different
now? Lyndon Johnson is a very
different type of individual. This was
certainly to be expected. Perhaps
we don't like his “style” very much,
but we can't blame him for being
different. As much as we may miss
the atmosphere that surrounded the
White House in the days of President
Kennedy, we must now accept Lyn-
don Johnson's way of doing things as
the best we can and try not to com-
pare him with the late President too
often.

If this were the only area of dis-
content the problem would be notice-
able but really not so very serious.
Unfortunately this is not the case.
Politically a rather curious situation
has arisen. A segment of the presi-
dent's own support is rather unhap-
py and for somewhat elusive reasons.

Last November President Johnson
was elected by a very wide margin.
This election was a result of a rather
broad coalition that did not want

 

 

 

Johnson Coalition Breaking

to see Goldwater even get close to
becoming president. Liberal Demo-
crats were a fairly significant part
of that coalition and from this
group today come signs of at least
mild discontent.

The congress elected last year
was overwhelmingly Democratic.
During the first session this year, the
congress passed bill after bill that
the President had requested. Many
of these measures were left over
from the New Frontier. Others were
entirely creations of the Johnson
Administration. However, all of them
were measures that the liberals had
been urging for years.

Why then would this group be
discontented? Many of the liberals
don’t like the President’s foreign
policy particularly with respect to
Southeast Asia and Latin America.

(Continued on page 4)

Other possibilities as speakers,
should an insufficient number of men
respond, are Robert Weaver, Nation-
al director of the Federal Housing
Authority, Victor Gruen, an archi-
tect, and Edmund Logue, head of
Urban Renewal for the city of Bos-
ton.

“The city is the biggest question
facing the country today,’ Sennott
says. “Everyone will live in a city

“The City...The Biggest Question”

at one time or another. If the cities’
problems aren’t solved, the problems
of the nation won’t be solved.” It was
with this in mind that the chairmen
chose this year’s topic.

These speakers will discuss the
problems of the city in the United
States today “from every possible
point of view,” according to the
Co-chairmen.

In analyzing the subject, Sennott

To Discuss “The City” at February Event

of the cities—the city as an envir-
onment—to determine whether city
planners and architects can improve
it. The economic problem in the cities
is acute, he feels. “The crisis of
urban poverty is one of the most
serious facing the cities now. The
middle-class whites are moving out,
to be replaced by lower class, poorer
workers,” said Sennott.

Another major area which will be
discussed intensively will be the race
question. “We will try to find out
just what barriers there are to Ne-
gvoes in achieving first class citizen-
ship in urban areas,” he added.

Sennott went on to point out that
both the intellectual and the prac-
tical viewpoint would be represent-
ed. “We have invited many men
whose primary field is theory, but
the mayors will be there to give an
appraisal from the position of one
who must work with these problems
every day,’ he commented.

The CONTACT weekend, explain-
ed Claxton, is designed to be “an
intellectual symposium, which will
attempt to bring well-qualified
speakers to the campus to stimulate
students.”

The February date was set, Clax-
ton noted, so that the students would
not be in the midst of a particularly
strenuous academic period. “It’s right
after final exams, so the class load
shouldn’t be too heavy,” he said.
“Maybe out of sheer interest and a
desire to learn something, students
will give up their dates for that
weekend, or bring her along to the
lectures and seminars.”

The format for this year’s meet-
ing will be roughly similar to last
year’s. There will be one speech
in the afternoon, and one in the
evening on each of the three days.
The speeches are to be followed by
panel discussions featuring the lec-
tures, professors from various de-
partments in the University and
students, and a short question-and-
answer session.

 

Eliminate the Petty Work.

Awad: True

By JIM AWAD
A few weeks ago, a Ring-tum
Phi columnist astutely examined the
myth of the Wash-

ington and Lee
Gentleman. The

columnist came to
the conclusion that
he no longer ex-
ists and that this
university, if it is
to keep pace with
the rest of the
country, must for-
mulate, establish,
and rally around a
new symbol.

The symbol | propose to serve as
our rallying point is not a tangible
one. It derives its potential neither
from man nor legend; it can’t be
found in the pages of history; and
its traces are in no way available to
the endeavors of scientific experi-
ment.

I propose that the students, fac-
ulty, administration, and Board of
Trustees of Washington and Lee
University look to that abstraction
upon which we place the name
“spirit” for future guidance.

Education Through ‘Spirit’

The dictionary refers to “spirit”
in many ways—vivacity, order, quick
resentment, courage, enthusiastic
loyalty, real meaning, the life prin-
ciple, etc. Each and every one of
these terms applies to the thesis
of this exposition adequately.

As a unified group, though, these
terms describe exactly what I refer
to when I make use of the word
“spirit.”

Obviously, the quest of “spirit”
must be a united one—including all
those in any way connected with
the university. | choose, though, to
approach it from the point of view
of the student, in hopes that the
faculty, administration, and trustees
will divine their respective roles
from what will be said here.

There seem to be two obvious araes
of study—academiec and social.

Whether we like it or not, we are
in Lexington to get an education.
This necessarily involves us in the
academic world, and it requires of
each and every one of us a tremen-
dous amount of work.

What I am proposing is that we
attack the problem and concept of
education with “spirit.” This invol-

ves courage, vivacity, quick resent-
ment, enthusiastic loyalty, and real
meaning.

Bringing it down to the level of
reality, which I am proposing is that
we lift ourselves above the level of
the day-to-day grind. Instead, let
us substitute the free expression of
ideas in a controversial and beneficial
manner. Of course, this would re-
quire a tremendous amount of effort
on the part of all students. But the
result would be a much more ration-
al relationship between students and
faculty.

No longer would the professor be
required to use “tactics” to make
sure the students are doing the work.
Gone would be the days of popquiz-
zes; gone would be the days of daily
assignments.

Instead, we would be working with
the professors toward a common
goal—true and interesting education.
No longer would education be based
solely on petty hour quizzes and
oral recitations in class. The amazing
thing is that education would be-
come a truly stimulating and note-
worthy experience. No longer would
incentive be killed by four years of
living from hour quiz to hour quiz.

A offspring would be
the atiraction to this university of
the best of all possible students who
really want to learn. On this basis,
the progress achieved above would
be self-perpetuating

Furthermore, this university would
rapidly come to be considered one
of the best in the Our de-
grees would valuable,
that we would be able to get bette:

The beauty of it ail is that thi
would require little additional effort
on the part of the current student
In fact, if both professors and stu-
ients approached the problem from
the point of view prescribed here,
we would, through cooperative ef-
fort, be able to eliminate the “petty
work” now running rampant on
campus and killing ineentive. What

But G Down W&L, 119-94,

But Coach Sees

Washington and Lee's varsity |
basketball team opened its season |
Wednesday night with a 119-94 loss |
to Bridgewater, but things don’t look
so band. This year’s edition is much
improved over last year’s assemblege
of basketball players, and several
opponents had better watch out.

Bridgewater broke on top and after
the first quarter led by less than
ten only once, but the final score
was not indicative of the game. Un-
til the last few minutes, with subs
playing for both teams, the Eagles
never led by more than 15.

The Eagles foreed an overload of
the W&L switching zone and scored
easily from the baselines, but when
the Generals could shut off these
shots, their defense look more than
adequate.

These good shots and free throws
tell the story. Bridgewater hit 45 out
of 85 shots for 52 per cent while the
Generals hit on 39 of 97 for 40 per
cent. At the line the Eagles hit 29
for 35, 83 per cent, while W&L fell
to 14 of 21, 67 per cent.

For the Generals captain Bob
Spessard helped to control the boards
with 12 rebounds, two more than
Sweitzer and Morrison. Surprisingly
enough W&L won this battle 59-41.

team in scoring with 21 points, fol-
lowed ‘by Steve Sweitzer with 20 and
Frank Morrison, in a substitute role,
with 16. Coach Verne Canfield has
set as goals for both Sweitzer and
Spessard double figures—in both
scoring and rebounding. And both
started on the right track as Spes-
sard followed Morrison with 13.

Worth comment is the fact that
these four hit on 47 per cent of their
shots while pulling in 40 rebounds.

Coach Canfield said that “the at-
titude of the six returning letter-
men is tops, especially that of the
two seniors, going for their best
years,” and this could mean trouble
for Old Dominion and North Caro-
lina Wesleyan, the Generals’ next
two foes.

Old Dominion, an away game to-
night, remembers our win over them
last year and will be trying to
avenge this defeat. All five starters
are back, but this team was sound-
ly defeated by American University
in its opener Wednesday. Unfor-
tunately for W&L this is not just,
any away game but Old Dominion’s
Homecoming. A win would be even
sweeter.

Dear Mom and Dad,

Ever wonder why your son wasn’t

teams are compiled through various
and sundry means (don’t ever knock
public relations until you've tried it),
the pro teams (the one’s that admit
it, unlike Alabama, Notre Dame, etc.)

counts: (1) Ability to fill the most
gaping hole on the team, (2) Avail-
ability. This last qualification means

Roanoke Squad
In First Meet

The Washington and Lee swim
team opened its season Wednesday
with a burst of power in defeat-

ing Roanoke College 53-33. Although
the times were very good for this
early in the season, the level of
competition furnished by West Vir-
ginia, East Carolina, American Uni-
versity and Catholic University lat-
er will challenge the abilities of the
team.

Two new pool records were set
by the Generals as Nelson Head
turned in a 56.7 in the backstroke
split of the 400 yard medley relay
and freshman Billy Ball clocked a
2:04 in the 200 yard individual free-
style.

Other W&L winners were Thorsen
in the 200 freestyle, Gary Bokinsky
in the 50 free, Clinard in the one
meter diving, Clay in the 200 yard
fly, Taylor in the 100 free, Kimmel
in the 200 yard backstroke, Law-
rence in the 500 free, Costello in the
200 breaststroke, and W&L in the
400 free relay.

Tomorrow the rifle team, captained

University rifle team in its first
match of the year.

 

Grambling, Slippery Rock, L. A.
State— these are small colleges that
year in and year out manufacture
“Little-All-Americas.” But this
year Washington and Lee ha sturned
out three Honorable Mention “Little
All-Americas,” John Anthony, Jeff
Novinger, and Tersh Baker.

Washington and Lee was _ also
well represented in soccer, placing
three players on the All-State team
and three others on the second team.
Co-captains Tim Henry and David
Redmond were joined on the first
unit by David Kirkpatrick, while
Fred Skinner, Brad Shinkle, and
Bob Larus made the second unit.

John Anthony, a Delt senior, was
the workhorse of the General of-
fense, carrying the ball 197 times for
915 placing him in tie for twenty-
seventh in the nation among small
college backs.

Jeff Novinger, one of the Generals’
tri-captains, is a KA senior and one
of the best linebackers in the small
ocllege ranks. While functioning best
against a running attack Novinger
also intercepted two passes and
broke up many more aerial plays.

Tersh Baker, another Delt senior,
was the leading pass catcher for
W&L this year, snaring 30 passes for
381 yards and three touchdowns. In
addition Baker was an outstanding
blocker.

David Redmond gained several
more honors this year. In the past

he has made All-State, All-South, |

NCAA Eastern Regional, and Most
Valuable Defensive Player in Vir-
ginia. This year he again made All-
State, missing a unanimous selection

by only one vote, and and All-South, |

two years in a row—a first for W&L.
Redmond and Taylor of Lynchburg
each polled three of the six ballots
for the MVP, but Taylor was award-
ed the trophy, possibly because Red-
mond won it last year.

Tim Henry, the other co-captain,
has made the All-State team four
years in a row and has proved ex-

team, for while not losing a single
player by graduation, Wesleyan has
picked up two good players who be-

last year. One of these was the MVP
in the Dixie Conference Tourney last
year.

The schedule is really rough this
year, with the first five games on
the road. On December 15 the Gen-
erals will open in Doremus Gym

they go on the road again for the

these first eleven games in decent
shape, they could be tough in Feb-
ruary. Let’s hope so and cheer when
they finally get home.

“Ain’t It Right To Want Freedom,”
or something of the sort.

On the streets of Washington,
workers and shoppers remained ob-
livious to the quasi-religious affair
on the hill above them. Sporadic
counter-protests throughout the day
had been greeted with indulgent
chuckles by the marchers, but this
massive indifference was far more
meaningful. In a country where such
protest is greeted with nothing
more than a casual glance, no march
can awaken a “national conscience”
which is unwilling to respond. All
day the dissenters had paraded the
streets of Washington, sublimely ob-
livious to their utter lack of effect.
If anything can equal their political
gullibility, it is their blindness to the
futility of protest marches as an in-
fluence upon the mind of America.

Liberals Said Unhappy
(Continued from page 2)

Here the liberals have a legitimate
gripe with the president. On domes-
tic issues, however, there seems to
be little reason for dissatisfaction.
Yet, there is talk of “homesick lib-
erals.” In congress the liberals rallied
once behind Edward Kennedy on
the poll tax amendment and then
were able to defeat the Dirksen
Amendment. On the whole, however,
they seem to be grumbling to them-
selves while they are sat upon by
the Johnson coalition.

What significance will this group
have in the future? Certainly they
won't try to deny the Democratic
nomination of Lyndon Johnson in
1968. This leaves 1972, but with this
a lot of other elements are involved.
For one thing, Lyndon Johnson
might control the party so complete-
ly by then that he could pick his
own successor. None the less, there
might very well be an effort to
nominate one of the Kennedy broth-
ers that year. If such an effort is
to be successful, the liberals must
start now and first by finding some

David Kirkpatrick, a senior PiKA,
