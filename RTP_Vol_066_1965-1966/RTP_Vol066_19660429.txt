Fraternities

Four recommendations concerning
W&L fraternities were presented at
the student hearing of the Self-
Study Subcommittee on Social Fra-
ternities Tuesday. Self-Study An-
alyst Dean Lewis G. John announc-
ed the recommendations to an au-
dience of 20 students, although only
10 fraternities had members present.

The proposals, which will go to
the Self-Study Committee proper,
and then on to the faculty, were:

(1) Washington and Lee should
direct its immedate attention to the
social problems of non-fraternity
students. In particular, the construc-
tion of expanded student union fa-
cilities should be started just
soon as possible.

(2) Fraternities should be requir-
ed to utilize on a regular basis the
services of local Certified Public
Accountants.

(3) The University administration
and the IFC should investigate means
of improving the economic status,
the security, and the position of
housemothers, through bringing them
into closer connection with the Uni-
versity.

(4) Fraternities, through the Inter-
fraternity Council, should continue
and expand the self-study program
that they have begun, with particu-
lar regard to the development of ap-
propriate attitudes and ideals, se-
lection of members, scholarship, and
finances. The University, through
the Dean of Students and the Stu-
dent Affairs Committee, might con-
sider the formulation and promul-

mittee approved a motion to request
the E. C. to appoint four students
who will work with four faculty
members, to be appointed by Dean
Pusey, to “continue study of methods
of stimulating student intellectual
activity.” This student-faculty com-
mittee was directed to report its
findings and recommendations to the
faculty, through the Courses and De-
grees committee, during the first se-
mester next year. The study com-
mittee will be “free to pursue any
line of enquiry it deems desirable,
including an investigation of inde-
pendent study and other programs.”
The Committee on Courses and De-
grees will provide the study com-
mittee with “advice and counsel,”
especially in regard to the evalua-
tion of existing programs and the
effort to place in perspective pre-
vious efforts to achieve intellectual
stimulation, both at Washington and
Lee and at other colleges and uni-
versities.

The Independent Study Program,
proposed recently by Jim Awad,
would move first-semester final ex-
ams up to the nine days before
Christmas vacation; each student
would be required during January,
to research and prepare a compre-
hensive project on any topic within
his major field of interest approved
by his faculty advisor. Such reports

Friday Edition—April 29, 1966

No Immediate Threat

Despite some apprehension, the Self-Study apparently will
pose no immediate threat to the fraternity system as it now
stands. To quote Dean John from the student hearing on fra-
ternities—attended by slightly over two per cent of W&L’s
fraternity men, including only seven fraternity presidents—
“fraternities are an integral part of university life.”

The Self-Study Subcommittee on Social Fraternities did, in
fact, consider fraternity elimination, required 100 per cent
membership, and deferred rush, but it declined to make any
recommendations on these proposals. However, it did recom-
mend four positive programs which are likely to strengthen
and improve social fraternities if adopted by the faculty, and
accepted by the fraternities.

The Subcommittee recommended that in order to alleviate
the social problems of non-fraternity students, an expanded
student union should be started as soon as possible. While such
a project would offer competition to the fraternities (a healthy
thing in itself), it would also help to end one of the more
cogent criticisms of the system—the social ostracism imposed
on independents.

The Subcommittee further recommended that fraternities
be required to regularly utilize the services of a local Certified
Public Accountant. This proposal, not to be confused with
the more cumbersome one which was rejected earlier by the
L.F.C., would give the houses some degree of security against
both financial mismanagement and plain dishonesty. Security
of this nature can only be beneficial to the fraternities, and it
creates very little extra trouble for fraternity treasurers.

Next, the Subcommittee recommended that means of im-
proving the economic status, security, and position of fraterni-
ty housemothers be investigated. Low salaries, the ficklessness
of house opinion toward their housemothers, and the social
disrespect shown to them make good house mothers hard to
find and still harder to keep. The result has often been hap-
hazard house administration and frequent laborious searches
for replacements. If the University acts to set higher standards
for housemother employment and fraternity treatment of them,
it can only result in better, happier, and more effective house-
mothers, and thus improve house management.

Finally, the Subcommittee recommended that the fraterni-
ties “should continue and expand (their own) self-study pro-
gram... with particular regard to the development of appro-
priate attitudes and ideals, selection of members, scholarship
and finances.” Despite the innocuous-seeming shotgun appeal
of this last proposal, the Self-Study seems to be in dead earnest
about it. If the faculty adopts this recommendation, the fra-
ternities will be expected to consciously work for goals of self-
betterment and to make annual progress reports.

If the fraternities accept this last proposal in good faith
the resulting conscious effort at improvement will provide the
strongest possible answer to the fraternity system’s critics and
should serve to bolter the lagging interests of fraternity men
in their own houses.

The Self-Study Subcommittee on Social Fraternities is to
be commended for its good work, and it is hoped that the
faculty will adopt its proposals and fraternities will accept them
as the assets that they are.

Independent Study

Most often students hear of some action taken by “the
hill” to curb social activity, restrict individuals or employ
power where it’s unnecessary. This is unfortunate because in
many cases the committee system which in the main deals with
student activities has been more than fair in its contact with
the student body. This was borne out this week in the Execu-
tive Committee's proposal of the independent study program.

The program, as presented by junior Jim Awad, is an
excellent idea, but, as its author will admit, it does need some
more study before it is feasible. The Committee on Courses
and Degrees which most students thought would simply throw
out the measure as unworkable, instead lent a sympathetic ear
to both Awad and EC president Few Mindel. The committee's
resolution which agreed with the idea and set-up a student.
faculty committee to study this proposal and others, went fur-
ther than was necessary in meeting its obligation to the stu-
dents.

This example, coupled with the formation of the Student
Affairs Committee and Student Union Committee, both of
which have proven invaluable liaisons for passing information
from the student to the administration, are examples of how
lack of communication can best be achieved, avoiding mis-
understandings.

It is our hope that the new committee, charged to “stimu
late intellectual activity” at W&L will be as successful as its
predecessors.

Fiditer-in~Chief Business Manager

By JIM AWAD

It’s awfully difficult to figure out
just where this university has gone
wrong. As a matter of fact, I don’t
think you can pinpoint the matter.
Rather, the sum total of all admin-
istrative decisions over the past hun-
dred years has led this school down
a certain path—the path of secure
mediocrity.

Obviously, then, what we must
do and what W&L needs the most
is to rise above this level of medio-
crity. But how? To be frank, who
knows? God knows, I don’t even
pretend to have all the answers,
but I would like to present some
positive proposals, in hopes that some
day someone on the Hill will notice
the stinking stagnation of this place
and take heed!

Academic

It has repeatedly been pointed out
over the past year that our ap-
proach to education is unjustifiable,
behind the times, and peculiarly ap-
propriate to students in a prep school.
As it stands now, the way we are
educated is through taking down
the “truth” as explained by our
professors in a notebook, memoriz-
ing it, and throwing it back on a
quiz or final.

You know, even if this approach
does leave some inherent value, by
the time you’re 21 and a junior, you
feel that you've reached the point
of diminishing returns and are wast-
ing a hell of a lot of time.

Anyway, it is my impression that
our institutional framework ought to
be geared to the creative exercise
of the inherent mental capabilities
of the individual. Somehow, I get the
feeling that memorizing notes dosen't
allow for this wind of thing. The
following proposals have the purpose
of suggesting just a few of the many
ways we can improve on the situa-
tion.

1-2-3-4

First of all, we've got to have
the best of all possible professors,
and the only way to do this is to
pay them salaries above what other
universities offer them. There is
no excuse for losing a good profes-
sor because another school offered
him more money. Secondly, we must
de-emphasize grades so as to afford
students the opportunity to lift them-
selves out of the practice of direct-
ing all of their inherent abilities to-
ward “grade-grubbing.”

Thirdly, we must de-emphasize
the lecture system, substituting in
its place a system geared toward
class participation, the case study
approach, seminars for all courses
over 200, independent study into
fields outside of the classroom, and
creative thought.

Fourthly, we must strive toward
the creation of a better physical
plant. How can a professor or honors
student do adequate, publishable re-
search unless he has the proper fa-
cilities available to him?

5-6-7-8

Fifthy, in order to allow students
more time to pursue subjects or
personal interest, we must eliminate
Saturday classes and distribution re-
quirements. Sixthly, we must have a
much more flexible exam schedule,
so that exams, if they must be used,
will examine how much a student
knows, rather than how much he can
cram in-between his Friday exam
and Saturday exam.
Seventhly, a wider range of cours-

must be offered, for, without
doubt, the current range is rather re-
strictive Eighthly, we must give the
professors the time and facilities to
research and publish.

Ninth, it is essential that more
and better speakers be brought in
to address us on topics of national
and intellectual interest. The two
University of Virginia experts on
the Far East who spoke here last
week are perfect examples of what I
mean

€a

Social

In this area, the first thing we
must do is to analyze the current
status of fraternities. While the
“little eighteen” are previding an
invaluable service with respect to
social life and housing, their effort
is not altogether positive. Perhaps a
large student union with Saturday
night combos and liquor, coupled
with a second-semester rush, would
release the Greeks stronghold on
eampus, thereby forcing the fraterni-
to justify themselves both in
attitude and aet.

Secondly, W&L needs to strive fo:
contact with the outside
world so as te put an end to its
sickening The key
here would provide for a
junior vear abroad, give eredit for

os 0) mir © 7 and Ralure 90 a

 

to facilitate an exchange of ideas and
to allow for outside research and
social projects.

Thirdly, W&L must de-emphasize
the past and begin to look toward
the future for a source of inspira-
tion. No doubt, the past can teach
us lessons, but it can also narrow the
horizon of our thinking and hinder
progress.

Fourthly, we should make every
attempt to put an end to the stifling
uniformity to the student body. This
can be done by recruiting students
from foreign nations, from the West
Coast, and from underpriviledged
areas. How can one broaden his
thinking if everyone thinks just like
him?

Fifthly, said countless

as I’ve

GRINS

lay Tales

 

 

times before, we have a demanding
obligation to encourage individuality
in every facet of university life.

Athletics
With respect to athletics, the cur-
rent policy is admirable in that it
gives every student a chance to par-
ticipate. Perhaps, though, if we sub-
sidized football and basketball, the
students here would have something
to be proud of and would have great-
er school spirit. Consequently, they
themselves would make every effort
to do their part in improving the
university,
Conclusion
Well, they asked me to write about
what W&L needs most. As I said,
you can’t put your finger on it,

 

“I'd love to... since Independent Study started at
They're all working so HARD!”

In Fourteen Very Easy-to-Make Errors

because it’s a whole atmosphere, at-
titude and environment that we’ve
got to fight.

Above I’ve stated just a few pro-
posals as the solution to some glar-
ing deficiencies. Unfortunately, no
space was available to justify each
proposal, but I intend to explore the
matter in more depth next year.

Above all, what this university
needs is dynamic leadership. It would
take such leadership to even begin
to consider the above proposals. But
you know, and I know, that the Hill
will read this article and others like
it, comment on how good the ideas
were, and then go about their work,
never even considering the possibil-
ity of action.

As a sequel to the recent faculty
cut system poll, Professor Martin
Merson has polled
his classes to de-
termine the stu-
dents’ opinions on
the cut system and
how it has affect-
ed them. Forty
nine students were
polled altogether.
including § fresh-
men, 22 sopho-
mores, 14 juniors,
and 4 seniors.

Agreeing with
the faculty, most students polled in-
dicated that they have treated the
liberalized cut system responsibly,
but about half indicated that the
faculty has not generally treated the
eut system in good faith. The student
consensus in the poll is that the cut
system has not lowered their grades
and that they were unaffected by the
suspension of the first semester au-
tomatic rule. The great majority
prefer to be given complete freedom
as to class attendance

The questions asked and
answer percentages out of
polled are as follows:

I would prefer to be given com-
plete freedom as to class attendance:
Yes—86 per cent: No—14 per cent

De vou think the liberalized cut
system has in any way lowered your
grades? Yes—10 per cent: No—90 per

Do vou think that vou have treated

Students Polled On Cut System’s Effects

Part Two

A second part of the poll surveyed
student opinions on reasons for jus-
tified elass cutting. Thirty-nine per
cent answered that cutting is justified
for whatever reason the student
chooses. Most of the 61 per cent that
did not mark this answer indicated
that cutting is justified (1) to attend

political, scholarly, professional
meetings, ete, which conflict with
classes; (2) minor contagious ill-

nesses (i.c.. colds, sore throat); (3)
last minute eramming for an exam:

(4) preparation of term papers, re-

for a considerable period of time;
and (5) extra-curricular activities
of some importance (campus politics,

troubadours, dance board, etc.)
which require ocassional cuiting of
classes.

A large majority of the 61 per
cent which believed that justified
cutting is conditional indicated that

Editor Choice Criticized

April 27, 1966
Editor, Ring-tum Phi
Dear Sir,

The Publications Board's choice of
Ring-tum Phi editors for next year
came to me as a shock. In no way
do I mean to reflect on the two men
selected. however I eannot under-
stand why Howard Epstein did not
receive one of the editorships. To
me his qualifications and experience
are unquestionable

But the 1 wish to raise is
not the comparison of the qualifica-
tions of various men for the positions
of editors of the paper What lI ques-
tion is the Board's function as the

issue

selector of the editors (and for that
editors of other publi-
eations). | charge that with the pres-
ent system the men chosen can re-
fle et neithe?
those who have worked with them on

matter the

the men desired by

 

     

  

 

graces of an editor he most likely
will not be chosen. Moreover it is
ludierous that the editor and busi-
ness manager of the Southern Col-
legian should have votes in the se-
lection of the editors, especially in
the light of the Collegian’s spotty
past and doubtful future. What de
they knew about good journalism

that any other student does not
know?
As an example, a member of the

Board and a member of my frater-
nity never approached me for my
opinions of the candidates, whose

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Racketmen at

UVa. Today;

Freshmen Defeat SMA, 7-1

By JERRY PERLMAN

Coach Canfield’s undefeated W&L
netters travel to Charlottesville to-
day for a very important match
with the Cavaliers of U. Va.
The BGenerals, throttled by rains
which washed out watches on Mon-
day and Wednesday, go into the
fray sporting an impressive 4-0 rec-
ord, Today’s match, though, prom-
ises to be the first real test of the
season for Canfield’s racketmen. The
Cavaliers boast an extremely strong
squad which includes five return-
ing lettermen, whose 9-3 record last
year included a win over W&L.

Freshman ace Tommy Rueger, the
General’s number one singles player,
can expect a lot of trouble from U.
Va. co-captain Jim Stephens, his op-
posite number on the Cavalier squad.
Stephens was runner-up in the At-
lantic Coast Conference tournament
last year and is having another fine
season. W&L captain Forrest Dick-
inson will also have all he can han-
dle in the form of U. Va. senior
Harry Burn, whom Cavalier Coach
P. Hunter Faulconer says “has the
most natural ability on the team.”

Although the varsity was hamper-
ed this week by rain, W&L’s fresh-
man tennis team managed to open
its six-mateh season. The Baby
Generals split their first two matches,
dropping their opener to Virginia
Episcopal School of Lynchburg 5-4
on Tuesday, but bouncing back to
trounce Staunton Military Academy
7-1 on Thursday.

In Tuesday’s match, VES jumped
off to a commnding early lead, win-
ning four of the six singles matches.
The only singles recorded for the
freshmen were at the numbers two
and three singles spots. Don Me-
Clure, playing in the number two
slot, took the measure of his op-
ponent 6-3, 8-6. Britt McJunkin,
playing number three, was extended
to three sets, but finally managed to
pull out a 1-6, 6-3, 6-0. victory.

The frosh almost managed to eke
out a victory via their doubles play.
Wins of 6-3, 6-0 and 6-5, 6-4 were
posted by McJunkin and Joe Daven-
port in the number one doubles
match, and by McClure and Jerry
Perlman in the number three doubles
match respectively. This tied the
match score at 4-4 with only the
number two doubles match left to
play. After a hard battle, Chris

I-M’s Closing;
Delts in Lead

The intramural season is coming
to a close, and the final results bear
a strong resemblance to the out-
comes of the past several years. Phi
Kap is making a strong run to re-
tain the Great Athletic Champion
Trophy which they have won for
the past two years.

The results, which have been post-
ed on the intramural board show
the Delts to be leading in total in-
tercollegiate and intramural sports
points with 1256, followed closely by
the Phi Kaps with 1241. Still to be
posted in intramurals are points for
wrestling, bowling, softball and col-
leyball. Participation points for
Spring intercollegiate sports will be
determinted at the end of the sea-
son,

At present, Phi Kap leads in the
fight for the Intercollegiate Trophy
with 568 points, followed by the Delts
with 527, and PiKA with 515. The
Delts head the field in intramurals
with 729 points, fololwed by Phi Kap
with 673, PiPhi with 667, and SAE
iwth 654. The winners will be pre-
sented with their trophies at the
Spring Sporis Banquet at Coach
Mac's estate on May 18.

Meyer and John White were downed
6-4, 6-4 and VES emerged the victor
5-4.

In Thursday’s match with SMA,
things were somewhat different, as
the freshmen took five of the six
singles and both of the doubles
matches played. The third doubles
match was canceled because of im-
pending darkness, leaving the score
7-1 in favor of W&L.

Singles wins were posted by
Davenport at number one, 6-0, 6-2;
McClure at number two, 6-1, 6-1;
McJunkin at number three, 6-1, 6-0;
Meyer at number four, 6-2, 6-3; and
Perlman at number six in the long-
est match of the day, 5-7, 6-1, 7-5.

In the doubles action, the matches
played were limited to 10-game pro
sets in order to beat the setting
sun. Both matches were won by
the freshmen, Davenport and Mc-
Junkin taking the first 10-3 and Mc-
Clure and Meyer the second, 10-4.

The freshmen travel to Charlottes-
ville today with the varsity to play
the U. Va. frosh, and return home
tomorrow to face a very tough St.
Christopher’s School squad at 2 p.m.
on the W&L varsity courts.

President Cole
Calls New Gym
Primary Need

 

In 1913 Robert Parker Doremus

visited the Washington and Lee cam-
pus, and because he was so impres-
sed by the friendliness and cour-

tesy of a student, he provided in his

will that upon the death of Mrs.

Doremus his entire estate should be

given to W&L.
This money was used to erect
Doremus Gymnasium which at the

time of its completion in 1915 was | —
the finest in the South. Yet today
Doremus is outmoded and inade-|/
quate for the needs of the Univer- |

sity.

Washington and Lee President
Fred C. Cole has realized this prob-
lem and has commented that “as a
major facility, this bears highest pri-
ority. This is obviously one of our
most important needs as a com-
plete physical facility.”

Preliminary plans for a new gym
are underway, and according to Dr.
Cole, “we are hoping to start an
organized campaign for fund rais-
ing by next winter. At that time a
target date will be set.”

The new gym, as tentatively pro-
posed, will be a structure separate
from Doremus and most likely be
erected in the area above Wilson
Field. Doremus will be maintained
however, and will be used for phy-
sical education and for individual
recreation, thus allowing for both
better and more complete facilities.

“... medalist honors”

Golf Team Goes To

Virginia Tournament

By RON KESSLER

Washington and Lee’s varsity golf
team, in the midst of a mediocre
season, travels to Hot Springs on
Sunday to play in the 36-hole,
medal-play Virginia State Intercol-
legiate Tournament on the Home-
stead’s championship Upper Cascades
Golf Course.

The State Tournament was origi-
nated by Washington and Lee, Vir-
ginia Tech and U. Va. in the late
1940’s. Since then, nine colleges
have been added to the list, mak-
ing a total of twelve participating
Monday. Each school designates six
to play, the low four of whom are
counted.

V.P.L. is the defending champion of
the tournament, and is, as Coach
E. P. “Cy” Twombly put it, “the
team to beat this year. Virginia has
the best chance to upset Tech; we’ve
got an outside chance, if we can
beat Tech and U. Va.”

The winner of the tournament re-
ceives a sterling silver bowl given by
the State Golf Association .

The team’s record so far this year
is 2 and 3. The Generals beat Hamp-
den-Sydney early in the season 7%
to 114; they then lost to Georgetown
6-3 and U. Va. 14-7. Most recently,
W&L, played Old Dominion and

Now for the meat of the column,
the SIPA honeys. We are being in-
vaded again, as we always are at this
time of year. There will be, as usual,
freshmen hanging out of their win-
dows hollering either grossities or
suavities depending on the target.
There will be, as usual, sophomores
driving up and down each street
in Lexington at least five times an
hour, each car window manned with
horns.

There will be, as usual, juniors
ridiculing the freshmen and soph-
omores for their childish attitudes.
And there will be, as usual, seniors
castigating the juniors for omitting
one of the finer pleasures in life.

What we are waiting for is the
successful pick-up of a SIPA Bunny
by a 5'5” “gentleman,” only to have
him find out that her older brother
starts at tackle for VMI.

Oh yes, there is one more “as
usual.” How can there possibly be a
SIPA convention without the candi-
date proposed by one of our own
“gentlemen?” In my four glorious
years at this lovely Hill-topped cam-
pus, 1 cannot remember one such
election without at least one unusu-
ally named candidate, one who for
some reason no true SIPA knows.
(1 was going to cite a few such
names used in the past to guide this
year’s plotters, but 1 have just been
reminded that the R-t P has no wish
to go where the Collegian has gone).

Last but not least, a note to all
seniors. Did you know that while
we have unlimited cuts for classes,
we have absolutely no cuts for grad-
uation? This means that any senior
who misses either the Baccalaureate

doesn’t graduate. Now you know
why they are both in the morning.
Everybody will obviously be suffer-
ing from severe headaches, and it
will be the last chance for torture
on the W&L campus.

The great joke is that there may
have to be two graduations this
year. One of the draft-dodging ex-
ams is scheduled for Friday morn-
ing, June 3. Anyone assigned that
date will most likely have to be
graduated at a special make-up
time in the afternoon. No one out-

Co-Captain Ed Crosland has led
the team thus far, taking medalist
honors against Hampden-Sydney
with a 74, shooting 73 against
Georgetown, and 76 against U. Va.
Crosland tied for fourth last year
at the State Tourney, and was run-

Freshman Bobby Matthews has
thus far had an outstanding season,
taking medalist honors against
Hampden-Sydney as well as in the
triangular match with Old Dominion
and Bridgewater, shooting a 74. Mat-
thews scored a team low of 72 against
Georgetown.

Commenting on the rest of the
team, Coach Twombly said, “Roger
Sennott has really improved this
year, and should do well at the
State Tournament. Jim Fulwider is
a good golfer, but he must get hot
on putting. Bob Duckwall has been
having a little trouble, but he’s
got the golf swing to do fairly well.

“The team as a whole,” Coach
Twombly continued, “is better bal-
anced than last year’s yet has a
worse record. We've got a fair
chance in the State’s and a fair
chance in the CAC.”

Friday, the Generals play Lynch-
burg and Roanoke. The College Ath-
letie Conference Tournament is
scheduled for May 13-14, hosted by
Washington College in St. Louis.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Rising Junior EC Candidates State Platforms

Richard Nash

There can be no doubt that Wash-
ington and Lee is one of the better
universities not only of the South,
but of the entire country. But to
say that we need a great many im-
provements is quite an understate-
ment,

The trouble with Washington and
Lee is that it has become so conser-
vative in the fear of making a mis-
take that it has almost reached a
point of stagnation. This does not
mean that we should kick up our
heels and charge recklessly into a
series of uninvestigated and radical
reforms. But it does mean that we
should begin to investigate and set
a course of action.

A prime tool which would great-
ly enable us to push forward would
be the division of the Executive
Committee into a legislative and
judicial body. With this accomplish-
ment, work may be speeded up by
the legislative division without any
hindrances. The honor court will
also become more efficient with its
specialization.

But this reform will only serve
as a main thrust. Next year the
committee must spearhead the attack
by doing ground work on such
things as conventional dress, float-
ing exam schedules, junior years
abroad, grading system changes, girls
in dorms, and many other issues.
Student preferences must be ob-
tained and appropriate action taken.

I have done my best to serve
you well both legislatively and judi-
cially for the past two years. If
reelected, I will attempt to do even
more to help you and our univer-
sity.

Dave Johnson

Fellow Classmates,

In this campaign, I have made an
effort to present honestly to you
my views on a number of issues.
To briefly review my position on
them, I give you the following:

(1) I strongly support Convention-
al Dress, but am opposed to an
Assimilation Committee with fining
power.

(2) I endorse all efforts to improve
academics including the possibilities
of an Independent Study Plan and
Junior Year Abroad, if practical ar-
rangements can be provided.

(3) I favor maintaining the frater-
nity system, and I encourage the use
of influence to accelerate the com-
pletion of the University-planned
student facilities

(4) I believe the Honor System
functions most effectively as it is

presently constituted, and I oppose
any changes in it.

(5) I am against any proposal to
divide the Executive Committee in-
to legislative and judiciary groups,
favoring instead the use of subcom-
mittees to expedite legislative mat-
ters.

You have my statement on the is-
sues. If I am elected to the E.C., I
pledge to work diligently and cease-
lessly as an effective member.

Respectfully
David T. Johnson

 

Lane Steinger

As candidate for Junior Class Rep-
resentative to the Executive Com-
mittee I speak from experience.
The past year on the E.C. has
shown me that there are two goals
which next year’s Committee must
have. The first is determination to
administer to the needs of the stu-
dent body by asserting its (the Com-
mittee’s) policies with the faculty
and administration. The role of the
Executive Committee is not to exe-
cute only those policies which the
administration desires. Any pro-
grams, initiated by students, which
are approved by the E.C, must be
made to be recognized on the Hill.

The second goal is an internal re-
organization of the Committee so
that it is more efficient. A great deal
of time in weekly meetings is devot-
ed to administrative functions, e.g.,
interviewing and selecting standing
committees such as Student Control,
which preclude E.C. investigation of
issues such as changing the grading
system to include plusses. The E.C.
should establish subcommittee to
deal with its administrative func-
tions. A separation of powers is not
necessary to accomplish this end
because the judicial responsibilities
of the Committee do not infringe
upon its other role, Division of the
E.C. into a Judicial Board and
Legislative Body might also prove
detrimental to the Honor System in
that the latter, meeting regularly,
would necessarily supercede the
Honor Court in prominence.

The above goals must be realized.
They are fundamentally important
and the success and efficacy of stu-
dent government at Washington and
Lee is contingent upon them. There
are, however, two specific goals
which the Executive Committee, to
be elected Monday, should investi-
gate before the end of this year.
First, the Committee should con-
sider establishing a Student Cur-
riculum Committee to exaluate
courses in the undergraduate school.
The Committee should also consider

 

sponsoring mixers with neighboring

 

Self-Study Proposals Heard

(Continued from page 2)

gation of affirmative guidelines to
prescribe for the fraternities, the
ideals, standards, and attitudes ex-
pected of them, and also to provide
a frame of reference within which
this self-study could be carried out.
The fraternities would be expected
to conduct this self-examination on
a continuing basis, and they would
be called upon to present evidence
annually to the Student Affairs Com-
mittee concerning their progress to-
ward achievement of acknowledged
goals.

In addition, the students present
voted, 9 to 8, that no fraternity be
allowed to remain at Washington
and Lee if its national organization
enforces a written discriminatory
clause on it. Although three WéL
fraternities would be affected by
such a ruling, the student vote was
unofficial and unconnected with the
Self-Study Subcommittee on Social
Fraternities. The proposal was origi-
nated by senior Syd Lewis. Dean
Atwood, attending the meeting, re-
marked that a non-discriminatory
declaration could come only from the
Trustees.

Another proposal to the effect that

the University should define the
function of the fraternities was pro-
posed by Rick Margolies, but it
failed by ten votes.

A proposal by Bob Lee that de-
ferred rush be adopted was received
so cooly that it was never brought
to a vote. Commenting on the stu-
dents’ proposals, Dean Atwood ob-
jected to the attitude of “what should
the faculty do to the students,” and
stressed the imporance of fraterni-
ties bringing about changes through
their own Interfraternity Council,

IFC President Chuck Griffin con-
curred with Atwood, stating that
the IFC is always ready to hear and
consider student proposals for change
in the fraternity system.

The Subcommittee on Social Fra-
ternities will present its four pro-
posals to the Self-Study Committee
in May. Presumably, the Self-Study
will inelude them in its final report.

I urge you to reflect upon the

Jody Kline

Since I am not able to talk per-
sonally with each of my classmates
and explain to them individually my
beliefs and ideas, I hope to use this
opportunity to reach all of them in
this way in order to outline the
programs and proposals that I would
like to see the Executive Commit-
tee consider next year.

I feel that the EC, being the most

capable of expressing student opin-
ion has an unutilized potential in
influencing the policies of the Ad-
ministration. For this reason I would
like to se the EC attempt to ac-
celerate the physical progress of
W&L—that is, speeding up its build-
ing and renovation program. I would
also like the BC to draw up some
guidelines derived from _ student
opinion concerning the admissions
policies.
Internally, I feel that there is
much that can be done to improve
our curriculum. I concur with the
proposals for a Junior Year Abroad
program, a more flexible exam
schedule, and the distinguished pro-
fessors lectures series. I would also
hope that the University would try
to complete the Self-Study Program
concerning curriculum as soon as
possible.

I have labelled my platform “Pro-
gressive Conservativism.” I am con-
servative in that I believe that
Washington and Lee has several tra-
ditions that should not be changed
because they have given her an
image throughout the country that
has ranked us above schools who are
possibly better academically. I do not
feel that mere change is synonymous
with progress. I would try next year,
if elected to the EC, to maintain the
facets that have made W&L a good
university and to sponsor progres-
sive ideas that could make our
school a great university.

 

Study-Plan Committee

(Continued from page 1)

Awad commented that he was
“pleased” with the decision by the
Courses and Degrees committee to
give the Independent Study program
further consideration. “We realize,”
he went on to say, “that as it pres-
ently stands, the program may not
be entirely feasible. We do feel, how-
ever, that the idea itself is well
worthwhile, and within a year we
hope to come up with something.”

Poly Sci Classes Polled

On Cut System’s Effects

than endure a poor lecture or class.
Very few of the student polled saw
justification in cutting (1) to do
anything rather than attend a poor
lecture or class; (2) for a morning
date or road trip; (3) minor non-
contagious illnesses (headache, hang-
over); (4) to make up for lost sleep;
(5) an occasional day off; or (6) im-
portant fraternity activities.

While the only students polled
were those in Professor Merson’s
classes, they seem fairly representa-
tive. There were about as many arts
majors as commerce majors, with
a few science majors.

In summary, the student cut poll
seems to show a considerable amount
of student judgment and respon-
sibilty in dealing with the cut sys-
tem. The answers given for what
constitutes a “justified” cut are par-
ticularly indicative of mature
thought. While there are some dis-
crepancies between faculty and stu-
dent opinions about the cut system’s
effect on grades, the poll, if it can
be considered representative, re-af-
firms that the liberalized cut system
is working and should be retained, if
not further liberalized.

 

Northwestern Professor
Discusses Joyce’s Life

As Seen Through Letters
(Continued from page 2)

wright, Mr. Ellmann gave his lec-
ture in which he commented on
Joyce's “mental scenery” as glimps-
ed at in his correspondences with
his family, friends, and contempor-
ary authors. He commented that
Joyce’s letters were often prevail-
ingly terse, contrary to the style
of his novels, and were often frag-
ments of self-analysis which have
had to be pieced together. His aware-
ness of his “moral nature” under-
lies most of his correspondence.

Problems encountered in editing
Joyce's letters arose because of his
proficiency in languages. He fre-
quently wrote in Italian (he spoke
Italian with his children) and cor-
responded with Ibsen in Danish,
which he studied by himself. He
also had some knowledge of French,
Latin, modern Greek, German and
Dutch. He mastered a few words of
Urdu, Burmese, Russian and Spanish
and a number of other languages in-
cluding Esperanto and Lilliput.

Following the lecture was a short
question period; the seminar then
adjourned to the gallery for coffee
and an opportunity to meet Mr.
Elliman on a more personal basis.

THE TRANSITION T0 SPRING gradually releases us all from our

musty Winter hang-ups. The state-of-seige atmosphere on campus
diminishes as the thermometer rises, and overnight that term paper
you’ve been dreading falls into place. Spring is also the proper time
to think about shifting your wardrobe in the direction of the warm

spectrum of colors. But before purchasing, look
ahead: is this a summer geared for absolute
relaxation, a summer job, or, if you're graduat- ,
ing, your entry into the business world next >
Fall? Make your selection accordingly.

“AWAY FROM WHITE” ‘That phrase charac-

terizes the gradual phasing out of the classic
white dress shirt. Today, color predominates,
and blue leads the pack. Look also for a wide
range of soft pastel shades, both solids and

LIGHTWEIGHT, EASY-CARE: these are the {1
watchwords in tailored apparel. Crisp, cool fab- 4
rics with built-in wrinkle-resistance and/or per-
manent press features are now standard. The
color story for Spring focuses on BLUEGRASS,
a blend of vibrant blues and sparkling greens.
It should rank as a top color consideration in
selecting all your Spring/Summer apparel. A
pin wale-cord suit, for example, in a lightweight
cotton/polyester blend, or a classic Natural
Shoulder seersucker suit in a BLUEGRASS
blend are excellent choices. Lightweight, double-

a whole new

blend perfectly with the new

Spring suits. Many of these color-toned dress
shirts incorporate permanent press features,
Another trend worth noting: the button-down
collar sans buttons. Collar points are slightly
longer, the buttons disappear altogether, and
the buttonless button-down may be worn with
or without a pin.

ACCESSORIES MAKE THE MAN, and you couldn't get off to a

better start than by selecting one of the new Summer straw hats.
Time was when Memorial Day marked the date for turning in your
winter felt and bringing out your summer straw, Today, any time
the weather's right, the time is right. The classic boater with its
flat top, relatively narrow brim, and colorful ribbon band remains
a top choice among college men, The panama with its characteristic
crown ridge has been modified in size and will appear in both closed
and open weave meshes, Though light, off-white and natural tan
shades predominate, you'll see a number of new color variations,
including a pewter gray milan with its characteristic center crease

THERE'S NEWS IN UNDERWEAR for Spring and Summer ‘66,

The breakthrough can be summed up in three words: slim, trim,
brief. Shaped suits, tapered shirts and slacks all call for up-dating

the underwear scene, with the accent on the slim look. Look for
mock-turtle T-shirte, as well as shirts with a deep neck which
doesn't show when worn with an open sport shirt. In shorts, news

is being made in close-fitting briefs with side slits for extra com-
fort. For the activiet, very lightweipht me
