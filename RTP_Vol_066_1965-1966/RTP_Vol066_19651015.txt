Viet Conflict

Picketing
Scheduled

In apparent conjunction with the
University of California at Berkeley's
“Peace March” Weekend, a pray-in

Commons have
Washington and Lee for today and
tomorrow.

A crudely lettered poster on the
ODK bulletin board urging stu-
dents to demonstrate against the
United States involvement in Viet-
nam called for students to join a
special Holy Communion service this
afternoon at the Robert E. Lee Epis-
copal Church, but Tom Brown, the
church’s chaplain to W&L, empha-
sized that the service is in no way
connected with any protests, that it
was scheduled to ask for general
world peace, and that no students
consulted with him before posting
the notice of a Pray-In.

The organizers of the Berkeley
demonstration said to the New York
Times Monday that this weekend
would see protests in seventy cities
around the world, including ones in
Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hun-
gary behind the Iron Curtain. In
this country, marches will be held in
Los Angeles, New York City, Boston,
Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, and
Macon, Georgia.

Dean Atwood has noted that while |
the administration does not object to
peaceful demonstrations on campus
the Lexington Police Department is

cause of the heavy traffic expected
on Saturday with Homecomings,

urges students to remain on Uni-

versity property to avoid arrest.

Faceless Protest

Lexington is bracing itself for its first seige of “Berkeley-
ism’ Saturday, but thus far the leaders of the group which is
supposed to picket the Commons (of all places) protesting
“U.S. Agression in Viet Nam,” have not seen fit to disclose
their identities.

Although we have no qualms about anybody demonstrat-
ing anything, it seems reasonable to expect such avid support-
ers of the protest to at least admit it. The rumors and sus-
picions surrounding the demonstration seem to be accomplish-
ing nothing but placing a great many people who are not in-
volved in an embat rassing position explaining that they are not
demonstrating.

If, on the other hand, the demonstrators are having dif-
ficulty locating an abundance of pacificts in Lexington, may we
recommend Demonstration, Inc, (there really is such an organ-
ization.) They advertise “our trained terrorists can tie up any
town. We guarantee to confuse the issue so nobody can ar-

rive at a solution!”

W&L Test Quakers
In Homecoming Tilt

The Quakers of Guilford will in-
vade the town of Lexington to face
W&L’s Generals this Homecoming
Weekend. The Guilford eleven, with
a record to date and 1, will
furnish the toughest opposition W&L
has met yet.

Off an impressive 56-6 win ove1
Bridgewater last Saturday the Quak-
ers really seem to have their offense
rolling. They've beaten Hampden-
Sydney 23-8, Elon 7-0, their
loss coming at the hands of Western
Carolina. The Generals lost to Hamp-
den-Sydney, a common opponent,
13-0, but comparative scores should
mean very little in this match.

of 3

sole

The Guilford team uses a variety

of offenses, including an I forma-
tion, the wing-T, and a “shotgun”
or spread alignment. To augment

this combination, the Quakers ex-
hibit numerous fast and big backs.
The first is in the person of Bill
Berchett, the starting quarterback.
An excellent short he can
run when the opportunity presents
itself, The backfield also features
fullback Bobby Belvins and halfback
Tommy Grayson. Both Belvins and
Grayson are big and fast and add
considerably to the power of the I
formation and the speed needed for
the spread.

Henry McKay, another very val-
uable factor in the Guilford offense,
returns the punts and kickoffs. The
line is anchored by Ronnie Wins-

Champagne Still On Ice

 

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

learn that no one
else seems to be
familiar with the

1915 Phillies, who
behind 35-game-
winner Grover
Alexander, won
the pennant,
though hitting
only .247 (if that’s
called hitting). As
a result we will
try again to give
away the now ice-
cold bottle of champagne.

of with the Mets),

in the same Mid-West backfield as

are they? And since that is far too

The next bucket of bull concerns
the World Series (just think, if SF
had won the pennant we could have
actually had a World Series, or at
least a series with one Japanese).
As this journalistic masterpiece
flows from pen to toilet paper, we
watch “I Spy” and wait for game
seven. So far we've seen four dif-
ferent teams: the Dodgers and the
Twins at Minnesota, LA

We are glad to see Mr. Ruffin’

comments on the “Mekong Delta,”

alias the W&L lower courts, but
why did he overlook the “Bonne-
ville Salt Flats,” the upper courts?

the people of South Vietnam their
request? Don't the principles and
goals upon which our country has
been built almost require us to aid
the People of South Vietnam.
Accepting a polar-opposite ap-
proach, we find further justification
for our part of the war. Let’s for-
get the idealism expressed above

cal view of the situation: The world

Does Pancho Gonzales really advo-
cate, as the school would lead us to
believe, sloping asphalt courts with
numerous cracks (to make the
bounces more interesting?), sur-
rounded by fences with lower con-
struction imported from the Ama-
zon jungles? And let us not forget
the only good metal fencing—the nets
on several of the courts. They make
wonderful padding for skidding
players. Perhaps the school is in
the process of installing a whirlpool
bath or an ultra-sonic on the courts
to cure these pillow bruises.

the West, and the East, and the
“Neutrals.” The United States is the
leader, protector and fortress of the
West. Now, whether we like it or
not, the East and West are fighting
each other in all parts of the world
every day. The East is bent on con-
quering the West, and the West is
determined that this should not
happen.

Since 1945, the East has been win-
ning victory after victory (Korea
excepted). Usually, they have used
internal

evasive tactics (such as
revolution) that are difficult to
counter. This time, though, they

have come out into the open and
challenged us on the battlefield. They
started the war—we didn’t. What's
more if we don’t meet and defeat

them on the battlefield, then they],

will resort to military conquest in
all further provocations, for it takes
up to 20 years to start a revolution
in a country, but military victory
can be had in a year or two.
