Want, Grant
Top Runoff
For Secretary

Primary elections yesterday re-
duced to two the number of candi-
dates in the races for secretary of
the student body and for Fancy
Dress president.

Billy Want and Bill Grant, with
312 and 152 votes respectively, won
the primary election for student
body secretary, while Ed Allen and
Warren Stewart won the primary
for Fancy Dress President with 319
and 141 votes.

Both Want and Grant won a ma-
jority in the primaries with 58.5%
and 58% of votes, respectively.

A total of only 533 votes were cast
in the primary for the office of sec-
retary and only 550 for Fancy Dress
President. This number contrasts
sharply with the 1033 votes cast
last year for secretary and the 990
for FD President in the final elec-
tions. While some students have
taken the low turnout at the pri-
maries as a specific symptom of the
general apathy which has prevailed
up until now during this year’s elec-
tion, EC members emphasize that
there will be a larger turnout Mon-
day.

As a result of yesterday's primary,
the following slate will be presented

to the student body in the final |

election Monday:

President:
Bill Jeffress (unopposed)
Vice-President:
Kirk Folio Mike Nation
Secretary:

Billy Want Bill Grant
FD President:

According to the student body
constitution, no other persons may
legally announce their intention to

After Five Hours of Deliberation...

 

After five hours of interviews and
deliberation the Judicial Board of
the IFC presented what may be
termed by some as one of the most
surprising slates of candidates in
years Wednesday night as five ris-
ing juniors were among the eight

 

men receiving nomination for posi-

tions on the IFC.

The candidates nominated were
Ren Manning, a junior SPE, for pres-
ident; Barry Vaught, a KA for vice
president; Kaz Herchold, a Phi Gam
sophomore for secretary; John Rey-
nolds, a Sigma Chi sophomore for
treasurer; and Jody Luck, a Pi
Phi junior for senior justice. Ellis

on the Board. IFC spokesman Billy
Cannon said Thursday that the
| Judicial Board had no designs to
include that many juniors, but after
considering the applications, inter-
views and records of past perform-
ances they felt that would be in the
best interest of the IFC and fraterni-
ties, specifically, to select these men
from the sophomore class.

Senior applicants were fairly
scarce among the thirty men who
applied. Further complications enter-
ed the picture when this year’s
junior justices, Vaught and Luck,
both candidates for the presidency,

were ruled ineligible for failure to
meet University scholastic require-
ments.

Collegian Case
May Go Back
Before Faculty

The future of the controversial
Southern Collegian took a turn for
the better this week as the Student
Affairs Committee recommended to
the faculty that Drew Baur, rep-
resenting the Publications Board,
be allowed to present the case
concerning the Collegian to the gen-
eral faculty at its May meeting.

The move means that the faculty
may reconsider its decision last
month to discontinue University
sponsorship and financial aid to
the humor magazine. After appeals
by the Friday Ring-tum Phi, and the
Publications Board among others,
University President Fred C. Cole
had referred the decision of the fac-
ulty to the SAC committee.

In presenting the case for the
Collegian Bauer said that he felt the
magazine had improved its content
considerably during the past two
years and he felt this trend would
continue if the Collegian were given
another chance.

He asked that the Collegian be
allowed to change its format to in-
clude more satire and fewer jokes.

The Collegian which usually ap-
pears at each of W&L’'s four major
weekends will be delayed this issue
because the present staff decided
to combine the last two issues feel-

cordings. The Marvelettes’ hit songs are “Playboy,” “Please,
“Beechwood 4-5789,” and, most recently,
‘Don’t Mess With Bill.” Smoky Robinson and the Miracles
are known best for “You're Really Got a Hold On Me.”

TUM PHI

Friday Edition

I?s Not Too Soon

As W&L’s first clique-free Big Four election drags toward
its uninspired and uninspiring conclusion, it would appear that
another sideshow in what used to be The Greatest Show on
Earth—Washington and Lee’s Circus—has folded its tents
and gone to join Dorm Rush and the Food Riot in the back
issues of the Ring-tum Phi.

Sharp-eyed observers have not reported even one example
of the Common Rumor or Cliquemaster’s Friend, once the
commonest harbringer of spring on this campus. If any fresh-
men have been threatened with whips and thumbscrews for
thinking disloyal thoughts, they have not chosen to tell us
about it. And nobody’s Weejuns smell of 3.2 beer from slop-
ping around in the traditional overflow of political generosity.

With the obvious exception of the last item, nobody except
the occasional cowboy who would like to be back in the saddle
again regrets the disappearance of these phenomena. Despite
their entertainment value, W&L is better off without them.

And yet, despite all the mudslinging, hypocrisy and gen-
eral viciousness that characterized the old-style election, it
appears that this university lost something when it disappeared.
Like that equally silly institution, the national party conven-
tion, it served a purpose, and if something is not found to fill
the gap which it leaves, W&L will be poorer.

For it may have something to do with the coincidence of
Springs Weekend and it may have something to do with the
atrocious weather, but the fact remains that less interest has
been apparent in this election than in any other in memory—
among the student body, among the faculty, and even, it
would seem, among the candidates themselves.

The danger in this is not that unqualified candidates will be
elected to office. It is obvious from the results of yesterday’s
primary that we are assured of competent and energetic leaders,
whatever the student body may decide on Monday. (The
Friday Ring-tum Phi extends it special congratulations to Bill
Jeffress, who has displayed as much ability and experience
as could possibly be looked for in an EC President, and hopes
that this regrettable lack of opposition will not hamper him dur-
ing his year in office.)

No, the trouble is that election week is not only the time
when the student body chooses its leaders; it is the only chance
we have of effectively expressing our feeling on the direction
the university should take. The students of W&L have labor-
iously won for themselves in the last few years a qualified right
to share in important administrative decisions. It would be
a pity if this right were to go by the board through lack of

 

interest.

And whtaever the deficiencies of the kind of bitterly
fought election which used to be held at W&L, it at least forced
out but the most apathetic students to stand up and be count-
ed on a few vital issues at least. To take only the most recent
and familiar issue, the candidacies of Fred Mindel and Bob Lee
last year reached into every corner of the W&L community
and made every student examine his views in the light of the
of the new ideas which these candidates put forward; no such
examination has taken place this year.

It is already too late and too close to the Springs baccha-
nalia for the traditional editorial injunction to consider the
issues and vote wisely to have any effect (if it ever did, which is
doubtful). But perhaps it is not to early for the students, and
especially the officers who will be chosen Monday, to consider
ways and means of reviving the mudslinging, backbiting, but
concerned spirit of the extinct clique election.

Faculty Poll and Interviews Indicate
Cut System Hurts Grades and Classes

“Freedom in determining class
attendance is not a right but a
privilege demanding the exercise
of a sense of responsibility. In
short, the faculty regards educa-
tion as a collective enterprise in
which a responsible student body is
as important as a responsible fac-
ulty.”

By WARREN MONTGOMERY
When the long-awaited liberalized
cut system was passed late last year,
it was greeted by
student applause
and the creditable
intentions of the
faculty, as ex-
pressed in the
above preamble to
the 1965 Absence
Regulations. Em-
bodying a suspen-
sion of the first
semester automat-
ic rule, unlimited
cuts for juniors
and seniors, and generous cuts for
underclassmen, the new system has
been effective for a semester and a
half now.

To evaluate the new cut policy in
regard to its effect on grades and
its possible elicitation of student re-
sponsibility, a poll has been taken of
the entire undergraduate faculty, and
the Dean of Students and several
professors have been interviewed.
The results, while occasionally qual-
ified, show several definite trends.

Summarizing the faculty poll and
disregarding the less decisive an-
swer percentages and their ques-
tions, we may conclude that‘ (1)
Most students have treated the cut

 

Montgomery

 

system responsibly, but a consider-

 

 

able minority has grossly abused it

and has suffered a marked fall in
grades. (2) Class attendance has
dropped, though not drastically, and

(3) most professors want to keep the
system as it is, at least for the time
being. Finally, (4) students who at-
tend classes regularly are more like-
ly to get help from their professors
while, conversly, consistent cutters
are likely to suffer more-or-less sub-
conscious retaliation by way of low-
er grades,
Faculty Questionnaire

The faculty poll consisted of six
questions meant to determine the
practical effects of the new cut sys-
tem and a multiple seventh ques-
tion attempting to summarize fac-
ulty personal opinion. Thirty-five
percent (33 out of 96) of the pro-
fessors to whom questionnaires were

;given sent them in.

The first question asked if the stu-
dents generally treated the cut sys-
tem and the automatic rule suspen-
sion in a responsible manner. Eighty
per cent said yes, 15 per cent said
no, and two professors refused to
comment.

On the second question, dealing
with class attendance, 73 per cent
admitted that their class attendance
has dropped relative to last year,
and 21 per cent stated that their
attendance has remained the same.
Again, two declined to comment.
number three asked if

system should be returned to
> way it was, liberalized further,
left as it is. Sixty-four per cent
chose the latter, 15 per cent wanted
to return it to the more strict policy,
and 15 per cent wanted to further

Question

 

liberalize it (presumably to give
freshmen and sophomores unlimit-
ed cuts). “Liberalize it,’ remarked
one professor, “and let the rest of
them hang themselves. They
shouldn’t be babied at all.”

Heavy Comment

Questions 4, 5, and 6 drew heavy
comment. Number four asked if the
professor is more inclined to give
advice and help to students who
attend class regularly. Eighty per
cent said yes. “I am very reluctant
to spend time with chronic cutters,”
remarked one teacher. Another com-
mented that “students more or less
regularly attending class deserve
more attention than those who do
ot.” Others stated that they prefer
to advise regular attendants because
their questions are more knowledg-
able and intelligent.

The fifth question asked if the
students’ cut records in any way,
even subjectively, affect the grades
given. Fifty-two per cent said yes,
42 per cent said no, and two did not
comment. Several professors cited
the importance of the subjective
in grading, especially in seminar, dis-
cussion, and oral language courses.
“It is hard for a disinterested student
to conceal his disinterest,” one pro-
professor pointed out. “I cannot help
noticing at exam time that TOTAL-
LY unfamiliar faces do show up.”
It also seems that professors have
feelings: “A professor never likes to
see 5 attenders in a class of 20.”
Retaliation may play a part in low-
ered grades.

In the sixth question, regarding
private cut systems, only two pro-
fessors admitted having some sort

of method of intentionally reward-
ing regularly attending students or
penalizing the cutters.

The seventh question offered seven
categories of opinion (any number
of which could be agreed with) and
invited comment, All but one pro-
fessor indicated that grades have
been generally lowered under the
new cut system. Fifty-two per cent
think that the low grades will teach
the students a greater sense of re-
sponsibility, and 27 per cent feel that
“the selective elimination of irre-
sponsible students” will raise the
academic caliber of the University.
Twelve per cent indicated that W&L
is failing to meet its in loco parentis
obligations to students and their par-
ents in maintaining the liberal regu-
lations; however, another 12 per
cent stated that student indepen-
dence is preferable to higher grades.
Nine per cent feel that the low
grades are placing the University in-
to academic difficulties.

Revealing Comments

Comments were prolific and often
revealing. One professor said that
the spirit of the cut system assumes
that students are “mature enough to
judge whether attendance at a lec-
ture or some other activitiy will best
contribute to their own academic
development.” This professor feels
that “spending time in the library
instead of at a poor lecture, attend-
ance at... political, scholarly, and
professional meetings,” and prepa-
ration of papers and research “re-
quiring intense concentration for a
considerable period of time” are in
the spirit of the cut system. But,
he continued, “sitting on one’s duff
in the fraternity house, last minute
cramming for an exam, and sack-
ing in...amount to a_ strongly
worded insult to the idea of educa-
tion and to the University.”

Another professor caustically com-
mented that “the experience of this
semester shows me only a conspicu-
ous lack of integrity and maturity
on (the students’) part.” Wrote an-
other, “Students absences

too much trouble

‘sank’ last semester.”

More favoreble to the students,
another professor feels “that the
University did a particularly poor
job of communicating to the stu-
dents exactly what their responsi-
bilities under the system are. I am

convinced that grades (and indi-
viduals) would have suffered less if
a good job had been done in com-

munications.”
Dean Atwood

Dean Edward C. Atwood added to
the finding of the poll by offering
some class statistics. “There has
been a substantial increase in the
number of juniors and seniors com-
ing under academic probation this
year, compared to those falling un-
der the automatic rule last year
There has been no similar increase
for freshmen and sophomores.” He
concluded that since the automatic
rule suspension applies to all under-
graduate classes and that free cuts
apply only to the juniors and sen-
iors, the cut system must be to blame

| for the marked drop in junior and

senior grades. He added, however,
that “the majority of juniors and
seniors have treated cuts responsi-
bly. It is certain individuals who
have caused the upper classes’ low-
er academic record.” Last semester,
five upperclassmen had cut prive-
lees removed for extraordinarily
irresponsible overcutting

Charlie’s Sundry Comments

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad,

Well, I can honestly say that one
of the oldest traditions here at
Washington and Lee is being con-
tinued with gus-
to this weekend.

It seems that in
_ the past entertain-
_ ers have often got-
; ten lost on the
) way to this thriv-
ying center of
of transportation,
and others have
simply elected not
to attempt to catch
their _ friendly
neighborhood jets.

So it is with no great surprise that
we learn Fontella Bass isn’t here.
It’s a good thing Betty Everett is.

There are other traditions here
that do go well with Springs how-
ever.

There is Goshen with its rapid
waters and slow streams, distin-

Georgetown Clubs Golfers
6-3, As Matthews Cards
Low Team Score of 72

Washington and Lee's Varsity
Golf team lost to Georgetown Uni-
versity Tuesday 6-3 in a match that
was, as Coach E. P. “Cy” Twombly
put it “closer than the score shows.”

The Generals’ low score was a 72,
shot by freshman Bobby Matthews.
Spencer Sullivan scored W&L’s other
individual win. Bob Duckwall, Sul-
livan’s partner lost his match, but
Duckwall and Sullivan took the best
ball. Matthews’ partner, Roger Sen-
nott lost his match.

In the first foursome, Ed Crosland
carded a 73 but lost to Georgetown’s
top man with a match low of 71.
Crosland and his partner Jim Ful-
wider lost the best ball one down.

The team was scheduled to meet
Lynchburg College yesterday, but
the match was postponed to April
27 due to a conflicting ladies tour-
nament on the Lynchburg course.

guishable now only by the speed of
the beer cans that fioat down them,
hiding the surface.

There is Goshen with the outdoor
combos, disturbing only the cows,
the stallions, and their mares. Isn’t
it wonderful that there isn’t a local
police station out there?

There is the sunny weather as
the weather man tries to make up
for Fancy Dress. By the most conser-
vative estimates he owes us over
twenty-five weekends of warmth
and sun just to atone for this
year’s F.D. 40-inch snow job. Note:
If it rains, attempts will be made to
circulate a student petition de-
manding his resignation.

I've been looking over the paper
as it stands so far, very, very late
on Friday afternoon, as I try to
fill up this incredible hole that
somehow has crept onto our Es-
teemed Page. Of particular interest,
seeing as this is Springs Weekend,
is Mr. H.L.H’s editorial, mentioning
the great W&L Circus. Well, looking
over some of the dates that arrived
by lunchtime today, it seems that
this year’s sideshow is going to be
better than ever.

While I'm on the subject of criti-
cal appraisal, we'd like to present
our “Milford Citizen” layout of the
year award to the Tuesday editor's
sports staff. They haven't broken the
tradition this year yet—at least one,
usually two or more, news strictly
news— stories buried somewhere in
the usual tripe
Well, consider the hole filled, fel-
las. Next week ... maybe.

Generals’ Netmen Continue Successes
With 7-2 Victory Over W. Virginia

Coach Verne Canfield’s W&L net-
men continued their winning ways
as they stopped the Mountaineers of
the University of West Virginia,7-2,
in a match yesterday at the Home-
stead, Hot Springs, Virginia.

This was the racketmen’s third
victory in as many outings, and kept
up the team’s hopes for a very
successful season,

Paced by freshmen ace Tommy
Rueger and team captain Forrest
Dickinson, holding down the num-
ber one and two singles spots re-
spectively, the Generals took four
of the six singles events and swept
all three of the doubles matches.

*Rueger, who has yet to lose a singles

or doubles match in varsity compe-
tition this year, was forced to go
three sets to won his opponent, 6-0,
3-6, and 6-3. Rueger then teamed
with freshman Ray Turman to post
a 6-1, 3-6, 6-1 victory in the num-
ber one doubles slot.

Captain Dickinson had it a little
easier than Rueger in his singles
match at the number two position,
needing only two set to defeat his
opponent, 6-1 and 7-5. The story
was somewhat different in his

 

doubles match; Dickinson and letter-
man Phil Thompson fought a mara-
thon duel in the number two spot,
finally emerging victorious by the
score of 14-12, 6-8, and 7-5.

The Generals’ other wins came
at the number four singles spot
where undefeated Drew Bauer
posted posted a 6-2, 6-4 victory; the
number five singles position where
Turman breezed to a 6-2, 6-1 tri-
umph; and in the number three
doubles event in which Steve Case
and Fred Taussig posted their third
straight win, 6-3, 6-3.

The Generals’ next match is Mon-
day at 3 p.m. on the W&L varsity
courts. Lynchburg College, a team
that Washington and Lee easily
handled last year 9-0, will furnish
the opposition. Coach Canfield,
thongh, is not taking the match
lightly. When questioned about this
year’s Lynchburg squad, he said that
“one or two new boys can mean
all the difference to a team, we are
going out there considering that
they are tough.”

Coach Canfield then spoke at some
length on the team’s chances for a
succesful season, saying that he be-

The Washington and Lee lacrosse
team plays its first league game
Saturday with the University of
North Carolina on Wilson Field.

Rated nineteenth in the country
last year, UNC was figured to be
stronger this year. Sporting a 1 to
3 record, they defeated East Caro-
lina and lost to Cornell, Yale (8 to 5)
and Denison (11 to 4). The Generals
lost to Yale 14 to 6 and Denison 8
to 3.

UNC has been playing without
Jeff Parker, an All-American at-
tack candidate, injured early in the
Yale game. Parker’s participation in
the game Saturday is in question.
The loss of Parker has unquestion-

ably retarded UNC’s offence, how-
ever, as Head Coach Dana Swan
put it, “even without Parker they
will have found some offensive
punch.”

One of UNC’s most outstanding
players is goalie Harvey Stanley,
ironically a high school teammate of
W&L co-captain Lance Bendann
and goalie Dave Johnson.

According to Coach Swan, “Car-
olina is a tough, experienced ball
club. It’s our first league game in
the Strobhar division, and our peo-
ple are really pointing for it; this is
for the money now. We hope to be
in top shape physically. We feel
we're ready to break loose on of-
fense; our defense has so far held
up.

lieved the squad could better the
winning record it posted last year.
He said that he was especially
pleased with the play of Rueger and
Turman, the two freshmen on the
varsity squad. When asked about the
remainder of the season, Coach Can-
field replied that he expected strong
opposition from the rest of the teams
on the Generals schedule, and that
UVa., Randolph-Macon and Old
Dominion would be especially hard
to handle. He went on to assert that
“the squad should be in excellent
condition for the CAC Tournament
in St. Louis; our chances for win-
ning are excellent.”

Coach Canfield then turned his
attention to his freshman teams
which he said were definitely strong-
er than last year’s squads and had
a good deal more tennis experience.
“The freshmen have a very import-
ant role in our program,” Canfield
commented, “I expect some freshmen

men to move up to the varsity by
the end of the season.”
The freshmen squad was rained

out in its last match with SMA
last week. It will make its first
appearance on the W&L courts

on Tuesday, April 26, when it faces
Virginia Episcopal. The team consists
of Dan McClure, Joe Davenport,
Britt McJunkin, Chris Meyer, John
White and Jerry Perlman.

 

General Nine

To Face H-S

Washington and Lee’s baseball
team “hopefully” plays Hampden-
Sydney at home today in the second
game of the season. The “hopefully”
refers to the weather, which has
forced postponement of the Bridge-
water and cancellation of the
Georgetown games.

Hampden-Sydney has had a good
deal more experience than the Gen-
erals, taking a Spring trip to Flor-
ida and droping “a few” games to
Jacksonville University.

W&L’s practices have been min-
imized by the rain and cold. A very
depressed Coach Joe Lyles stated
that “the pitchers just aren’t warm;
they can’t fire. We haven’t been out-
side for several days. The whole ball
club is losing their muscular move-
ments; inactivity is taking its toll
on the boy’s cardiovascular endur-
ance in running. We are at least two
weeks behind. Hampden-Sydney
has always had a respectable ball
club. They've probably played ten
more games than we have; they've
been winning and losing. We'll just
have to play it by ear.”

 

Applications for the position of
dormitory counsellors for next year
should be submitted to Dean At-
wood's office by next Friday.

cellent chance for final passage. I
favor this because I do not believe
that students would use the Student
Union facilities if beer is not allowed.
There should be a continual and re-
ciprocal exchange of information be-
tween the EC, the four standing com-
mittees and the student body.

The _ Assimilation Committee
should take on the positive func-
tion of better orienting freshmen by
providing printed information on
opportunities in clubs, publications,
and other activities. A dormitory
committee composed of head and
assistant head dorm _ counselors
should handle disciplinary problems
in the dormitory. A junior year
abroad program should be estab-
lished at W&L.

A curriculum committee which
would take suggestions from the
student body evaluating the courses
at W&L, should be established. A
more flexible exam schedule is
needed. Students with a G.P.R. of
1.5 or better should have the op-
portunity of taking one ungraded
course outside their major each se-
mester. The purpose is to allow stu-
dents to take courses that they would
like to take but are afraid would
hurt their G.P.R.

A genuinely good paperback book
store should be operated at W&L in
a manner to place a large number
of books in the hands of students
even if it operates at a small loss.

The EC should explore with the
administration the possibilities of
getting additional quiet study places.
The Southern Collegian should be
continued but financed by another
method.

If elected I will work for the ac-
complishment of as much of this
platform as possible. I will also try
to represent the views of the student
body and will appreciate any sug-
gestions. Finally, I am prepared to
devote the time and effort necessary
to the fulfillment of the secretary of

the student body.

are those such as what is left of
the speaking tradition, conventional
dress and the Honor System—char-
acteristics of W&L that make it
distinctive and must be maintained.

On the other hand our school is
changing generally so we must con-
tinue to improve. I feel that a great
deal can and should be done to im-
prove the Freshman year both in
the curriculum and dorms and so-
cial. Each year there are a grow-
ing number of independent students
and improvements must be made for
them—the new Co-op and Student
Union will provide the new EC with
an excellent chance to show its
leadership in this field. I feel the
EC should actively work with facul-
ty and administration to represent
student views on courses, curricu-
Jum, and every aspect of life at
W&L. The EC should also work for
student independence as much as
possible to avoid administration de-
erees coming through student organ-
izations and activities such as the
abolishment of the Collegian.
I am not listing a platform of ten
or twelve “actions” I am going to
take since I feel anyone who has
seen a W&L election before realizes:
1) platforms vary little from year
to year, 2) from candidate to can-
didate, 3) the adeas are usually
quckly forgotten after elections, 4)
and even if elected there is little
the person can do to achieve his
action since most of the matters he
is representing you on have little
to do with his platform.
For this reason I have tried to
tell you generally how I feel, for if
elected my duty would be to seek
out your views and my obligation
to represent you.

of the offices were contested by
more than two candidates, and that
only one candidate appeared for

According to the terms of the con-

in Monday's election, since no other
candidates’ name may be placed on

counted as no vote.

As in primary elections, voting
will take place Monday in the Stu-
