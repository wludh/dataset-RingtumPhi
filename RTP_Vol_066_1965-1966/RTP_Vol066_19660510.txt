CONGRESSMAN WELTNER MAKES his point to a full house last night

at duPont Auditorium.

Atlanta Congressman Hits
GOP Southern Reactionartes

By JOE WILSON
News Editor

In a seathing attack upon reac-
tionary Southern Republicans, Con-
gressman Charles L. Weltner last
night in duPont Hall called for
Southern youth to join the Demo-
cratic Party. The Atlanta Democrat
called upon his audience to join
with the party which can solve the

oppressive problems facing the
South.
Weltner acknowledged that the

Democratic Party of Georgia and
probably most Southern States rest-
ed upon the Young Democrats for
organization. Furthermore, the future
for youth is in the Democratic Par-
ty because personal organizations are
falling apart while the need to or-
ganize is increased as the Republi-
cans grow.

Reactionary Republicans

The Democrat compared today’s
Southern Republican Party to the
reactionary Democratic Party of
fifty years ago. The Democrats of
1910 were in reaction to Carpetbag
rule and the Populists, while today
the Republicans are the reaction to
the race issue.

Today's Southern Republicans ery
State’s Rights and are a reversal of
fifty years ago. Weltner does not be-
lieve that economic conservation is
the appeal of Republicans, rather it
is race which has attracted the Mad
Democrats.

“The Democratic Party can’t be
rebuilt by being against anything—

Revise Charter

BY RICHARD BATTIN

On Tuesday, May 8, the Conserva-
tive Society adopted a new revised
constitution and had its annual elee-
tions. Some of its plans for the fu-
ture were announced

The constitution provides that the
society will maintain its non-parti-
san political and education il char-
acter. The Society will also continue
to affiliate with the Intercollegiate
Society of Individualists, Ine

The elections were held under the
the constitution, with the
following results: President, Jeffrey
Gavner, of Brecksville, Ohio; Vice-
President, Jeffrey Wainscott, of At-
chison, Kansas; Secretary, Michael
Herman, from Washington, D C.; and
Peveral Settle, from Fort
Worth, Texas. Gayner was vice~
president of the club this year,

this is not lasting.” Rather this par-
ty of youth must work to solve the
enormous problems which hinder
the South. Most outstanding among
these problems is the race gap be-
tween white and Negro populace.
Today prejudice has made the Negro
a “drag on society,” it must be the
goal of problem solvers to reduce
this gap to produce a better South.”

The Young Republicans, after hav-
ing offered their services to the
Buena Vista Republican Party sev-
eral weeks ago, have embarked on
an intensive campaign to swing this
heavily Democratic community to
the Republican column. Planning has
begun for both this Spring and the
following Fall previous to the No-
vember elections under the co-lead-
ership of freshmen Art Love and Ned
Driscoll.

Buena Vista

Efforts of the YR’s have been ex-
erted in two areas: a telephone sur-
vey to determine the political lean-
ings of the Buena Vista population
and daily trips to Buena Vista for
the purpose of compiling voter reg-
istration lists. These lists will be
used to compile a card system which
will facilitate future campaign work
in this previously neglected area.

The W&L chapter has received
aid from representatives of the Mary
Baldwin YR Club and has indicated
that they have been promised help
from the YR elubs at Hollins, Sweet
Briar, Randolph-Macon, and possib-
ly Southern Seminary for the Fall
Program.

Fall Program

The Fall program will consist of
a canvass of Buena Vista voters done
by boy-girl two member teams.
Complimenting this effort will be
evening social events and updating of
card system

In addition the club will sponsor
a “Political Action Course” to in-
struct those who are new to precinct
work in the fundamentals and will
be given as the first activity of the
Club in the Fall. Upon completion of
the canvass in the Spring, a voter
registration drive will commence
Finally, one week before the election,

IFC Passes CPA Proposal;

Hinkle Receives IFC Award

By RODDY ROERIGER
The Interfraternity Council last
night named Sam Hinkle the Out-
standing Freshman of the year and
also passed the CPA finance super-
vision program.

Sam Hinkle, a Delt from Shelby-
ville Kentucky, was voted the Out-
standing Freshman of the Year
Award. His qualifications included a
3.0 Grade-Point Ratio, Honor Roll,
Phi Eta Sigma, Freshman Execu-
tive Committee Representative,
freshman football, varsity track,
U.C.A., best pledge in his house, and
a member of two house committees.

The CPA program which was pass-
ed is very similar to the original,
however, this program is on a trial
basis for one year. Basically, it re-
quires each fraternity treasurer to
take his books to a CPA once a
month for an audit. This will insure
that each treasurer is very precise
in his bookkeeping and that he
knows exactly where his fraternity’s
money is being spent. The CPA
program also will provide some sort
of course to teach the treasurers a

Hungarian Says
US Image Good

By AL CEDARHOLM

Ivan Boldizsar, Hungarian novel-
ist and playwright said last night in
a speech at Reid Hall, “There is
nothing like an overall general im-
age of the United State in Hungary
and there is nothing but an overall!
general image of Hungary in the
United States.” The speaker, author
of novels, short stories and plays.
gave a talk entitled “The Image of
the United States in Hungary and
Vice Versa.”

Boldizsar said that the citizens of
the United States are all conscious
of the sections in which they lice.
ie. the deep South, the East Coast
etc. However, in Hungary “this is
nonsense.” Hungary considers us as
one nation, not a federation of see-

 

tions or states.

Boldizsar claimed that we take
many things for granted in this
country. He said that Hungarians

realize the strength and power of the
United States better than the peo-
ple here. Yet even though we com-
mand such a good image in that East
European nation, Boldizsar explained
that four events have hurt our im-
age in the recent past and present

Number one was the assasination
of president Kennedy. He said that
the people of Budapest stopped and
cried on the streets when they heard
the news. They thought what was
coming. They didn't think it could
happen here

On the second hand th
ians could not believe

Hungar-
that someone
eould be killed by an intruder in an
American police station (Oswald)
Thirdly. the Domminican
hurt our image

ists entered Hungary in 1056

And lastly. the Viet Nam War is

pean countries than it is here

correct and uniform method of book-
keeping.
Expected Cost

The expected cost of the CPA
Program is from $200 to $300 a year,
depending upon the efficiency of the
treasurer in keeping the books. A
major objection to the CPA pro-
posal was that this is not fair to
fraternities with good treasurers be-
cause they do not need the service.
However, this was countered by the
argument that a fraternity cannot be
guaranteed of a good treasurer al-
ways, and thus it would benefit in
the chance that a weak treasurer
was elected.

Also argued is that if a house has
a good treasurer, the CPA cost may
be greatly reduced, for the CPA
would require an audit only once
every two or three months rather
than once monthly. The program
could be a useful method for the
house to judge the treasurer.

The CPA Program as announced
last night will begin with the 1966-
67 school year. The program wac
proposed last semester.

Last Wednesday, the executive
board of the Young Republicans
journeyed to Randolph-Macon Wo-
man’s College in an effort to bring
the girls’ schools into fuller partici-
pation and closer liaison with the
projects in the Shenandoah Valley.
Under discussion was the W&L pre-
cinct and a planned conference to be
held next Fall at Natural Bridge.

Persons interested in working on
the publicity and campaign commit-
tees have been asked to apply to the
respective committee chairmen, Bill
Meinyk and Art Love. Also, the
membership committee announced
that registration for 1966-67 in the
YR’'s is now underway.

Collegian Given
Final Axe Job

In one of the rare appearances
by a student before the faculty in
a regularly scheduled meeting, Drew
Baur pleaded the case yesterday
for the return of the Southern Col-
legian to official University spon-
sorship.

The faculty refused to reconsider
its action of last February which re-
sulted in the withdrawal of Uni-
versity funds and subsidies from the
Collegian.

Drew Baur represented the Pub-
lieations Board in his appeal. Baud
serves as the president of the Board.
Last year, he was editor of the
Southern Collegian.

Reasons for the withdrawal of
funds as stated at the time of the
action were that the Collegian had
been a source of embarrassment to
the university for a number of years
and that the content of the magazine
had shown a continued decline in
quality and in taste.

Held in New Science 305 and be-
ginning at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, the
short meeting ended barely 45 min-
utes later .

The shout which arose when the
defeat of the Collegian was an-
nounced caused one faculty mem-
ber to comment that it was like the
“roar of a Nazi crowd in Hitler's
Germany.”

Baur’s presentation was the first
item to be presented to the faculty.
Following his presentation, the fac-
ulty discussed the entire Southern
Collegian issue in private.

Particular incidents of bad taste
were pointed out and discussed by
members of the faculty.

In a related action, the E.C. unan-
imously approved the disposition
of the Gilliam Award monies, as re-
quested by the co-recipients, Sec-
retary Joe Framptom and President
Fred Mindel. Each man could des-
ignate some campus group to re-
ceive $75.

Mindel gave both the $75 and the
$50 awared to him personally to
the University, requesting that it be
used to establish a fund for the
“furtherance of racial integration
at Washington and Lee.” This may
include recruitment, scholarships,
cultural enrichment, or anything
thing else, at the sole discretion of
President Cole.

A stern warning
intentional passing of cold checks
and the use of false identification
cards was handed down last night
as well. In two resolutions unani-
mously adopied, the E.C. “strongly
urged” students to refrain from these
two practices. The resolution on
falsifying ages in an attempt to
purchase liquor specifically includ-
ed verbal misrepresentation of age,
in addition to false documents.

It is expected that the new E.C.
will consider again making the in-
tentional passing of cold checks an
honor violation, as it was for many
years. ;

Three of the four student mem-
bers of the joint faculty-student
committee to study the independent
study program were appointed. Bill
Jeffress, Kirk Folle, and Jim Awad
were picked, with the fourth to be
selected by the newly elected Execu-
tive Committee.

The Judicial Board’s Justice

The newly elected IFC Judicial Board has
exhibited in its first action the several injudi-
cious characteristics which make justice only
an infrequent by-product of its decisions. The
case of the Judicial Board vs. Phi Kappa Psi
indicates unmistakably that the IFC must re-
form the procedures of the Judicial Board,
providing for a clear statement of punishable
offenses and a forthright declaration of the
rights of the defendant. Under the present
super-secret arrangement, being accused is in
itself an indication of guilt; the Judicial Board
reasons that if a fraternity is accused, it has
obviously done something wrong.

In its handling of the Phi Kappa Psi case,
the Judicial Board demonstrated its jaded con-
cept of justice. The fraternity was arraigned
on four charges: 1.) having a girl in the chap-
ter house after 2 a.m.; 2.) inciting and abet-
ting a drunken brawl in their parking lot that
same night; 3.) threatening to overturn a
professor’s car; and 4.) hazing the same pro-
fessor, who is a neighbor, by the shouting of
obscenities and noisy behavior at night.

Three representatives of the fraternity
faced the Board to answer the accusations.
As to having a girl in the house after hours,
the girl’s date testified to the contrary. Uni-
versity Proctor Bob Murray had been present
that night, and had later assured the fraterni-
ty president that he did not see any girls in
the house. But Bob Murray was not called. No
witnesses were called.

The drunken brawl turned out to be a
fight between a Delta Tau Delta freshman
and the brother of Phi Psi’s houseboy. Phi
Psis became involved only when the houseboy
started to join in the fight, and all three com-
batants had to be restrained. This was the
source of the complaint. Members of the fra-
ternity broke up the fight; they didn’t start
or participate in it. But the freshman who did
fight was not questioned. No witnesses were
questioned.

Identification of the drunk who threaten-
ed to overturn the professor's car was never
made. It was never established that he was a
Phi Psi, although it was determined that only
one person had ever offered the threat. Five
other fraternities are in the immediate vicinity,
yet the possiblity of it being a member of
another house was not considered. The profes-
sor was not called to testify; a member of the
Board had previously interviewed him, thus
securing his testimony.

Finally, it was conceded that there had been
shouting and disorderly behavior around the
house, but without any intention of persecut-
ing the professor. But was the fraternity’s
leadership notified of this situation previous-
ly? They were not. Were they given an oppor-
tunity to correct it themselves, before being
hauled before the the Judicial Board? They
were not. The professor did not testify at this
point either; he had already been “interview-
ed.” There was no testimony.

Based on these findings, the Judicial Board
found the Phi Phis guilty of conduct unbe-
coming gentlemen. For this nebulous offense,
the fraternity was given “a severe reprimand,”
a $100 fine, and placed on conduct probation
through Openings, 1966.

The Student Affairs Committee meets on
Thursday to review this sentence. As a first
step towards reforming the spotty procedures
of the Judicial Board, we hope the Committee
alters this penalty, at the very least removing
the conduct probation. We agree that a fra-
ternity should be punished for wrong-doing,
but they must enjoy the same rights as a citizen
in a civil court, and must be punished only
for those offenses which can be proved. How
ever, the Board considers such irrelevant facts
as a fraternity’s academic standing, attendance
at IFC meetings, and “general attitude’ in
reaching a decision. This is about as fair as a
trafhe cop considering previous violations in
deciding whether or not to issue a summons.
The cop and the Judicial Board are equally
guilty of ignoring the specific question of
whether or not the offense has been commit-
ted.

This whole mess show that at least two new

additions to the IFC by laws are necessary

First, a set of rules governing fraternity rela-
tions with neighbors and the community. This
must provide penalties for public drunkenness,
excessive noise, disorderly conduct, property
damage and harassment of neighbors. Second,
some tough procedural guarantees for fraterni-
ties brought before the Judicial Board. This
section must include provisions for rules of
evidence, the right to call witnesses and ques-
tion them, the right to be faced with the accus-
er and the right to be tried and judged for

specific violations. Futhermore the conspiracy |"
of silence surrounding the proceedings must ||

be broken up.

We expect the IFC to correct these de-
ficiencies; they surely must realize that the
hard-and-fast ‘justice’ they mete out can be
just as harmful as no punishment at all. We
believe the Judicial Board convicted the Phi
Kappa Psi Fraternity of nothing so much as
being Phi Psis. The complaints must be sat-
isfied, but a punishment not justified by the
provable facts will not suffice. The IFC is
mature enough to realize that these rights
must be extended to its member fraternities.
Guilt must be proved, and then punished.
A fraternity must be guilty beyond a reason-
able doubt; it is no longer acceptable to con-
vict merely on the suspicion that the defen-
dant is not innocent.

The Lee Poll

While we join with the Friday Edition in
feeling that a comprehensive poll of the stu-
dent body on the honor system is desirable,
we cannot but disagree with the faulty and
alarmist reasoning which led to this conclu-
sion.

A tradition such as the honor system does
not grow stronger when it is not challenged,
nor does it weaken when it is challenged. Bob
Lee’s poll was straightforward and not at all
an attempt to put something over on the his
readers. He specified the terms of his survey
made all his caveats, and stated his purpose
at the very beginning. Lee did not maintain
that his poll had universal statistical integrity.

We strongly disagree with Lee’s conclu-
sions, and indeed dispute that if the poll sam-
ple were extended the results would show the
laxity about the honor system which Lee be-
lieves to exist. However, his questioning of
the honor system does not constitute an un-
dermining of either the tradition or the Uni-
versity. If such a poll did undermine the “mu-
tual student-faculty and student-student trust,”
then perhaps this trust did not ever really exist.

 

Parking Revisited

As the number of student-owned cars in-
creases, the problem of inadequate parking
space on campus grows more severe. It has
now reached the point when the happy soul
with a 10:15 a.m. class is unable to park any-
where, save in the rutted auto graveyard be-
hind Doremus Gymnasium. And with the
Doremus parking area in its present condition,
our happy soul is lucky if he doesn’t break an
axle,

The parking space in front of Doremus
Gymnasium could be increased by one-third
if the roadway running running along the
building’s northern face were widened, and
a ten foot chunk taken out of the lawn imme-
diately in front of the building. This would
provide parallel parking space for about
twenty additional cars.

Another touch which might make the life
of the student motorist a little easier would be
the painting of white lines to guide his parking,
and conserve space. If lines were once there,
they have disappeared.

Students might be induced to park be-
hind the Gym if the area was regraded, and
some of the hazards to life, limb, and axles
eliminated. The ROTC building is scheduled
to go up on part of the land, but we hope to
see parking facilities improved in the remain-

ing area,

 

Lee Continues Discussion On Honor System

 

Absolute Penalty Supplies No Opportunity
For Violator To Redeem His I ntegrity

By BOB LEE

If my article last week tended to
undermine the mutual  faculty-
student trust at Washington and Lee,
as has been alleged, I am sincerely
apologetic and disappointed. The
poll was not offered as a reflection
of the entire stu-
dent body’s
attitude toward
the honor system.
I thought that I
had made it pat-
ently clear that no
such _interpreta-
tion was intended.

The poll was,
however, an ac-
curate reflection
of the attitudes of
students in three
fraternities toward the honor system,
an attitude which is indeed “shock-
ing.” If the poll succeeded in dem-
onstrating to a few students their
shamefully ambivalent attitudes to-
ward the honor system, if it suc-
ceed in defining the legitimate na-

 

ture of their responsibility under
the honor system, if, indeed, it did
make a few students rightfully in-
dignant, then I confess to no guilt.
The Absolute Penalty

I have concentrated on the abso-
lute penalty partly because I consid-
er it a cruel hoax. We pride our-
selves on the honor system because
we believe it operates successfully
as a result of students’ determina-
tion to see it work. Presumably,
students adhere to the spirit of the
honor system, not out of fear of the
absolute penalty, but out of the con-
viction that the provisions of the
honor system are reasonable and
just. If this is true and the absolute
penalty is not necessary as a deter-
rant, what funetion does it serve?
Ostensibly, the absolute penalty ex-
ists solely as a punitive device, to
be applied to those who cannot sat-
fy the expectations of the commun-
ity. Since the absolute penalty ob-
viously serves no rehabiliatory func-
tion and does not seem to embrace
any appreciable benefit for the com-

Top C-School Graduates

Go To Stanford, Hopkins

By JOHN CARRERE

The Washington and Lee School
of Commerce and Administration has
been one of the tops in its field
for quite a few years. Reputed to
be one of the three best in the
country, the school has sent many
of its graduates through some of the
best graduate colleges.

This June the Commerce School
graduates another strong class. The
graduating seniors will certainly add
to an already lengthy list of out-
standing postgraduate scholars.
Strong performances in the past
ean be especially noticed by consid-
ering graduates who have achieved
a Masters of Business Administra-
tion. Richard McEnally and Skip Es-
sex graduated one-two last year

munity, it’s sole function is the re-
lease of vindictive energies of the
community. The absolute penalty is
a shameful and pitful act of vengence
directed at those who have already
suffered incalculable shame and dis-
grace,

But there are those who will in-
sist that the absolute penalty is
necessary as a deterrant. What they
contend in effect, is that no honor
system will work effectively unless
some penalty, unimaginably harsh,
exists to “cower” some students into
a sense of honor. Although such a
contention prostitutes the very val-
ues of “the spirit of the honor sys-
tem,” it is worthwhile to consider
this assertion. It has been recently
shown (though, I imagine, not prov-
en) that violations of law correlate
positively not with the severity of
the penalities to be inflicted for such
violations, but with the incidence of
detection and apprehension. I don’t
believe that it is too far-fetched
to invoke these same conclusions for
honor violations, since many pre-
sumably stem from the same im-
pulses and motives.

It would seem, therefore, that each
step which maximizes the individ-
ual’s chances of being reported for
violations would tend to discourage
honor violations. But, today, it seems
that too many students are hesitant
to report violators, particularly fra-
ternity brothers and friends, because
of the severity of the penalty to be
inflicted on these violators. In the
three houses that I polled, nearly
two-thirds of the students indicated
that they would be more willing to
report violatiors if a modification of
the absolute penalty were to be
made. Since one-half of these same
respondents also indicated that they
were aware of violations and had
failed to report them, it would seem
that modification of the absolute
penalty would indeed discourage
honor violations. Thus it would ap-
pear that a less severe penalty would
serve more effectively as a deter-
rant.

Student Government Head
Discusses Phi Psi Action
To the Editor:

I would like to express my sur-
prise and concern over the recent
LF.C. Judicial Board decision con-
cerning the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
Not only is the penalty inflicted
upon the fraternity wholly ineom-
mensurate with available evidence
of wrongdoing, but the manner in
which the matter was handled is
truly disconcerting.

I would hope that the LF.C. Judi-
cial Board or the Student Affairs
Committee take the initiative to re-
consider the matter, recommending
some lessening of the penalty. I
would also hope that the L F. C.
Judicial Board in the future observe
certain basic rights of fraternities in
considering violations of this nature.

Sincerely,
Fred Mindel

Lee! A few hardy souls are risk-
ing life and limb several afternoons
a week to learn about the
known affectionately as “Football for
Fun.” Rugby originated at Rugby
school in England about 1825, and
is one of the oldest and roughest
contact sports now played through-
out the world.

Rugby consists of two 40-minute
free-for-alls, with five minute inter-
mission to bind up wounds. The ball
resembles an over-blown  bootball
and is simply advanced toward the
opponents’ goal by carrying it. It
may also be passed laterally or

kicked ahead.

The ball is put in play by several
methods: a set scrum, a loose scrum,
and the line out. The set scrum in-
volves 8 members interlocking arms
and “heeling” or kicking the ball out
of the scrum when it is thrown be-
tween them. A loose scrum forms
whenever a ball-carrier is tackled
(when 6 or eight players are kick-
ing at the ball he is usually anxious

SecondIn Thwarting Rams

In a blaze of clutch hitting and superb pitching from Jim

W&L baseball squad doubled

its seasonal number of victories by sweeping a double header
from Richmond Profession Institute.

With overcast skies and rain threatening, the General hit-
ters came to life right away in the opening inning of the first
game. Captain Eric Sisler opened with a single through the
hole into left field. Dave Kirkpatrick followed with the same

putting Sisler on third. After Kirk was erased on the basepaths,
“®Tom Mitchell drove

in Sisler, stole
second and scored on Jack Anthony’s
sharp single to right.

With this two-run cushion, Coop-
er proceeded to put down the Rams,
with their only run coming on two
base hits with a stolen base sand-
wiched in between. Limiting RPI to
but five hits, Cooper gained his first
victory of the season, after being
denied victories when pitching solid
games but having little support. The
Generals added single runs in the
third and fourth innings to add in-
surance to the win, with rbi’s going
to John Wolf. Charlie Freret, re-
placing injured Ed Bishop at third,
collected two hits, and gave some
needed initiative to the W&L at-
tack.

The Generals came back deter-
mined to sweep the pair of games.
Coach Lyles selected Pete Heuman
to throw. Heuman, throwing very
hard in the cold weather and break-
ing his curve ball off extremely well,
baffled the Ram batters throughout.

Fresh with the first game under
their belts, the Generals started
quick again in the bottom of the

first loading the sacks with one out
but failed to score.

Lee Continues Discussion Of The Honor System

(Continued from page 2) there is no second chance accorded

the one who errs, no opportunity for
him to prove to his fellow students
that, given another chance, he can
prove himself a man of honor.

But what of the student body? Does
it gain anything by a student’s ex-
pulsion? Only the sanctimonious
few can benefit from the sense that
they have weeded out the weak and
maintained the integrity of the stu-
went body. But the community has
lost a great deal, because in the
student’s expulsion, it has abdi-
cated its greatest responsibility—the
responsibility to a fellow student. No
greater indictment could be served
on a community, and Washington
and Lee must wear heavily this
burden of guilt. Our responsibility
isn’t to punish for no perceivable
benefit, but to seek to rehabilitate the
few who err. But is this what we do?

pervade all systems of “justice,” but
I sincerely doubt if this principle can
be applied to our honor system. Is
there anyone here at Washington
and Lee who can honestly admit that
equal punishment should be accorded
the boy who steals one hundred
dollars and the boy, who in a mom-
ent of indiscretion, cheats on a test?
Does the boy who cheats habitually
deserve no greater punishment than
the boy who cheats for the first time
and is caught? And finally, is the
boy who readily admits his guilt be-
fore the Executive Committee, al-
though he realizes that he could
escape punishment simply by lying,
be punished when the habitual
but gifted violator, who knows that
only a confession will establish his
guilt, lies and goes unpunished? And
isn’t it perhaps a little ironical that
the student who presents fraudulent
identification in order to purchase

| have also wondered why the
absolute penalty has been considered
as the only plausible deterrent. Is
it not possible that other penalties
which are almost as severe, but
exist which are almost equally as se-
vere, but which permit the student
to return to Washington and Lee and
prove himself a man of honor? Would
not, for instance, a year’s suspension
serve equally as well, and yet per-
mit the individual to avoid the ir-
revocable stigma of expulsion.

Fraternity Placed On Probation

(Continued from page 1)

The fight was between the Phi Psi
house boy and a member of another
fraternity. The disturbance led the
plaintiff to call for the police con-
cerning which he remarked that the
complaint “was not only for this
instance but as a culmination of
continuous disruptions by the fra-
ternity.”

Finally, the “girls” were actually

 

der any standard of good taste and

decency,” and furthermore that the
fraternity was responsible for the
conduct of its employees while on
duty. Evidence resulted in the IFC’s
disregarding the accusation concern-
ing the girls.

Dishonorable Violator?
Under the present system, a per-
son is not merely convicted of a
single dishonest act, he is stigma-
tized as a dishonorable person. Sure-
ly, no one believes that a single act
of dishonesty makes a person, ipso
facto, a dishonorable man. But what
other conclusion can realistically be

IFC Violations

Phi Kappa Psi was charged with
a violation of By-Law X, Section 4,
Paragraph B which states, “Girls
must be out of the house by 2 a.m.
on every night...,” and By-Law
X, Section 4, Paragraph H which
states that no undesirable conduct

misconduct which the fraternity had
already begun to do, and was placed
on Conduct Probation through
Openings Weekend of 1966. These
measures are designed entirely as a
warning, for as one member of the
IFC Judicial Board asserted, the
IFC has approached this case with
the hopes of handling it in such a
fashion as to prevent such a situation
from occurring again.
