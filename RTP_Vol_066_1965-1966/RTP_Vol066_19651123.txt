Architect Slated To Check
Tentative Allocations
Within Two Weeks

By AL CEDARHOLM
Staff Reporter

According to Dean Atwod, the
Student Union Committee which has
previously made suggestions for the
proposed expanded Student Union
building has tentatively allocated
space for suggested additions and has
eliminated certain previous consider-
ations. However, Atwood said that
all allocations in this plan drawn
up by the committee were tentative
pending considerations by the Uni-
versity architect. The plans must be
checked for feasibility, first of all,
and secondly the architect must
check to see if the structure is even
architectually possible. According to
Atwood, the architect should be in
Lexington within two weeks,

Present Plans
In the present plans on the main
or second floor will be included a
room for the Executive Committee
with a separate entrance. There is to
be a chaplain’s office and chapel.

Parents’ Weekend Group
Is Appointed By IFC;
Blair Heads Unit

By BILL WILKERSON

The IFC has appointed a standing
committee on Parents Weekend of
students to consider and develop
plans for all future Parents’ Week-
ends. Bill Blair, Sigma Chi, from
Charlotte, N. C., was chosen to head
the group which will work with Mr
James W. Whitehead to discuss such
problems as the program of events
and the housing question. The IFC
has total responsibility for the week-
end, as a result of the decision of the
Parents’ Advisory Council.

Additional members of the
mittee include Tom Baremore, a Pi
Phi sophomore from Shreveport,
John Burk, a senior Kappa Sig from
Fort Worth, Robin Dyer, a DU from
Hinsdale, Illinois, and Jimmy Kier-
sky, a ZBT sophomore from Mem-
phis.

The remaining members are Jody
Luck, a Pi Phi junior from Manassas,
Virginia, Dick Penny, a Phi Kap
junior from Erlanger, Kentucky, and
Pete Van Dine, a junior from
Doylestown, Pennsylvania

The housing problem will be the
major obstacle to a successful
weekend, according to Blair. If
the parents of all four classes are
included as planned, Chairman
Blair says, “They would have to
come with the understanding that
they might have to stay as far
away as Roanoke.”

THE RING-TUM PHI

A Wise Decision

We note with satisfaction the appointment of a permanent
IFC Committee on Parents’ Weekend. This committee, headed
by sophomore Bill Blair, has its work cut out for the next year:
it has full responsibility for housing of the large number of
visitors expected at the 1966 Parents’ Weekend.

The IFC is to be commended for responding in this man-
ner to the resolution passed by the W&L Parents Advisory
Council, acceding to the IFC’s suggestion that freshman par-
ents be invited to future Parents’ Weekends. The new com-
mittee will have to arrange accommodations for an expected
1200 people, a task which swamped the Advisory Council and
the University Administration when freshman parents were last

invited in 1964.

Shouldering the responsibility for this difficult job is an-
other indication of the steady maturation and improvement of
the IFC as an efficient and viable instrument of student govern-

ment.

It is pleasing to see the IFC assume this greater role at

Washington and Lee.

 

A Clarification

The Ring-tum Phi wishes to acknowledge an error in that
it attributed the sentiments of Mr. Paul Herron to the Depart-
ment of Journalism and Communications in his recent article
in the Washington Post. We regret the implication of conden-
cension and prejudice on the part of the Department toward
the Ring-tum Phi stemming from this error of fact.

 

The Ring-tum Phi
The Ring-tum Phi is published Tuesday and Friday during the college
year. It is printed by the Journalism Laboratory Press, Washington and
Lee University. The mailing address is Box 899, Lexington, Virginia.
Entered as second class matter September 29, 1946, at the Post Office,
Lexington, Virginia, under the act of March 3, 1878.

‘Waiting For Godot’ Entertaining
However Creaky Barn Inadequate

By MIKE NATION

Those who missed the Trouba-
dours’ presentation of “Waiting for
Godot” this past week should feel the
poorer for having not seen it. It was
a thoroughly competent rendition of
an entertaining, artistically and in-
tellectually im-
portant modern
play. “Godot” is
considered one of
the outstanding
works of the Ab-
surdist theatre.

The Trouba-
dours aid heavily
in cultural educa-
tion at W&L by
attempting to pre-
sent as many dif-
ferent forms of
drama of a cultural and intellec-
tual interest as possible. The liberal
arts college aims for the well-
rounded individual academically and
culturally. Washington and Lee does
fairly well in overcoming its small-
ness and relative isolation to pro-
vide for eultural opportunity through
sich activities as the theatre

Where W&L falls down is in the
failure te provide an adequate faci-
lity for the theatre group which
is, by the way, the largest single
extra-curricular activity on campus.
One ean hardly deem as adequate
a drafty, creaky barn in excess of a
century old which, as legend has it,
was originally a hospital and a pool

One feels that Dr. Pemberton was
referring to Zorba being in love
with life itself. Material gain was not
all-important to him. It was the dec-
oration not the cake and icing. If
the decoration wasn’t there, “What

and as deliciously edible as ever.

tie, partly it is the most praiseworthy
in life, partly beeause it is the rarest

Students Have Conservative Outlook

 

By FRED MINDEL
Student Body President

Unquestionably the two most pre-
dominent trends in student activity
on the national
level would con-
sist of the Berkley
|| Free Speech
_ movement and the
political demon-
strations, particu-
larly the = anti-
Vietnam protests,
which have sprung
up all over the
| country. If one

. looks past the spe-
ee cific ends of each
of these, he will observe that they
are both the same type of activity;
they both involved students who are
rejecting external values imposed
upon them from without, whether
these come from a university ad-
ministration or the Johnson Admin-
istration. In both instances one finds
students expressing their opinions,
their will if possible which are de-
rived from personal rather than ex-
ternal and arbitrary values.

If one looks closely at W&L stu-
dents he can find here too the same
type of activity, although its speci-
fic form is on a level somewhat re-
moved from these national move-
ments. W&L students are also, to

   

 

some degree, reflecting external val-
ues imposed from without in favor
of values which they determine in-
dividually, They are not engaging in
picket lines or teach-ins or riots, for
there is a somewhat different means
geared to somewhat different ends.
Three main types of external values
have been or are in the process of
being reflected by an ever-increasing
portion of our student body. Certain
traditional values, such as some of
the more arbitrary aspects of Con-
ventional Dress, are being challeng-
ed. Students do not mind wearing
a coat and tie. What they are be-
ginning to mind is being told they
must do this. Certain administrative
values, such as the archaic cut sys-
tem which was recently replaced by
a more liberal one, had begun to
be challenged. Students felt that they
were quite capable of determining
for themselves when they should at-
tend classes and rejected having this
dictated to them by means of a limit-
ed system.

Even certain student-group values
such as the recently overthrown po-
litical party system which was based
solely on straight fraternity voting,
antagonized individual students to
the point where they openly re-
jected it. Students refused to have a
few individuals in their fraternity
dictate to them who they must vote

 

for. The main point with these few
examples of W&L student activities
is that, although they are on a dif-
ferent level than much of the na-
tional student activity, they are
nevertheless of the same general
type—for they too consist of the at-
tempt to replace external arbitrary
values with internal, individually -
imposed ones.

Two obvious questions seem to
emerge. The first, Why are the spe-
cific forms that W&L activity takes
different from these national move-
ments? and the second, What, if
anything, does this mean? Is there
any validity?

One occasionally hears, to the ef-
fect that “other campuses are con-
cerned with truly meaningful and
significant issues while W&L is
caught up and smothered by its own
pettiness and short-sightedness?”

Before attempting to answer the
question of why there exists a dif-
ference one must first determine
what really is the difference. For
purposes of simplicity, I shall iso-
late the anti-Vietnam protests which
take place on a national level and
try to compare it with corresponding
activity, political or other wise,
which is found on our campus. To
begin with, W&L cannot legitimately
be attacked for being concerned,
even primarily, with local issues that

 

By NICK RUFFIN

The traditional idea of the Wash-
ington and Lee gentleman has been
replaced by the image I described
last week. To demonstrate what has
been lost, I offer the following de-
scription from James Baldwin’s No-
body Knows My Name.

I suppose it can be said that
there was a time in this country
when an entity existed which
could be called a majority, let us
say a class, for lack of a better
word which created the standards
to which the country aspired. I
am referring (to) or have in mind,
perhaps somewhat arbitraritly, the
aristocracies of Virginia and New
England. These were mainly of
Anglo-Saxon stock, and they cre-
ated what Henry James was to
refer to, not very much later, as
our Anglo-Saxon Heritage or
Anglo-American connections, Now
at no time did these men ever form
anything resembling a popular
majority, Their was
that they kept alive and they bore
witness to two elements of a man’s
life which are not greatly respect -
ed among us now: (1) social forms,
called manners, which prevents
us from rubbing too abrasively
against one another and (2) the
interior life, or the life of the mind.
These things are important; these
things were realities for them and
no matter how rough-hewn or dark
the country was then, it is import-
ant to remember that this was also
the time when people sat up in
log cabins studying very hard by
lamplight or candlelight.

Mr. Baldwin may have attributed
more influence to the class of gentle-

nation as a whole. But the high im-
pact of the concept of the traditional
gentleman on the elite student body
of Washington and Lee is very prob-

 

able.

men than they actually had on the| 7

 

The balance of values in the tra-
ditional gentleman has ben dis-
torted in his modern derivative.
If the original idea of the gentle-
man were still held at W&L, it
would be complementary to, rather
than in conflict with education
here.

At this point let us examine the
decline of certain Washington and
Lee traditions as demonstrative of
the preversion of the gentleman con-
cept. A true gentleman would re-
ceive all men as being worthy of
his consideration and greeting. He
would feel himself to be in com-
munity with his fellow man. As a
W&L student he was to accept all
other students as sharing with him
the opportunities and responsibilities
of the educational experience at the
university. He would warmly and
sincerely greet one and all.

But today the Speaking Tradition
has become a means of status dem-
onstration. The student body has
been divided on lines of prestige
or coolness. Those who consider

 

Ruffin Attacks W GL Image of Gentleman;
James Baldwin Quoted to Reveal Decline

themselves to be of high status will
not speak to anyone they consider
beneath them. Studs won’t speak to
fish. The more of a stud the student
thinks he is the more fish he sees
beneath him. Those who are con-
scious of this status game always see
more fish than studs, for if a stu-
dent sees more equals than inferiors
he would no be in an exclusive mi-
nority. For example, upperclassmen
do not speak to freshmen after rush
week.

The effect of the status game is
that those that speak to those
above in the status receive no re-
sponse. As a result there are more
unanswered hello’s than there are
answered ones. In a short time a
student stops greeting others if
he receives no response.

The true gentleman’s approach to
dress would be to dress in such a
way as to be appropriate for the oc-
casion. This means that one would
dress so as not to be disrespectful
of others. If style or custom change

South Vietnam Malady Lingers

By JAMES CHANCE

The French departure from Indo-
China following their calamitous de-
feat at Dienbienphu precipitated a
major confrontation between East
and West, with ultimate domination
of all of South-east Asia at stake
Under the dynamic and popular
leadership of Ho Chi Minh, the new-
ly created state of North Vietman
gravitated into the communist camp,
while South Vietnam under Presi-
dent Diem aligned itself with the
West, particularly the United States,
whose commitment to the perpetua-
tion of an effective anti-communist
government in South Vietnam be-
eame irrevocable with the estab-
lishment of the South East Asia
Treaty Organization

From the very conclusion of the
French-Indo-China War, it became
the avowed aim of the North Viet-
namese government to reunify Viet-
nam under communist domination.
The guerrilla war which had been
so effective against the French was
never suspended; its alm was simp-
ly shifted to the ultimate conquest
of South Vietnam. It was inevitable,

however, that the war should pro-

liferate and escalate to the point
where neither side could isolate it.
U.S, and Status Quo

The United States presumes to
have a considerable interest in the
maintenance of the status-quo in
South-east Asia, At the behest of
successive governments in Caigon,
the American commitment has grown
to the point where more than 150,-
000 Americans are presently en-
gaged, Our commitment is based on
several premises. The first of these
is the fact that now that we have
committed ourselves, it would con-
situte an irreparable loss of face
should we now decide to abrogate
our treaty obligations to that nation,
To Asians, this is an important con-
sideration, and perhaps we should
not regard it too lightly.

Secondly, there are those who
still subseribe to the policy of
“containment.” The advocates of this
policy refer to the successful imple-
mentation of a similar policy in
Europe after 1045. These theorists
suggest that a similar policy can be
adapted to meet our present needs
in Asia. Lastly, there are those who

 

dangle before the American public

 

the disquieting consequences of
withdrawal. They believe that
should South Vietnam fall, all of
South-east Asia would fall like
“dominoes,” eventually endangering
democratic India and even Australia.

Realistic Look

These are the reasons which advo-
cates of the war in Vietnam raise to
support their position. But let us
look more closely at them, These
proponents of the war suggest that
the “loss of American face” caused
by the evacuation of American
troops would be disasterous. It would
tend, they argue, to undermine the
confidence of other friendly Asian
governments in our resolve to main-
tain their independence in the face
of communist aggression. But be-
cause this policy has been effective
in the past, must we become im-
prudent slaves of the past and com-
mit ourselves more deeply in a war
which can never be won and which
will continue to take a rising toll
of American and Vietnamese lives’

pelled to have turkey with the folks
at home, but they are quietly sav-
ing their pennies so that next year
they can go to New York for
Thanksgiving just like those world-
ly Juniors do.

The Senior, of course, will be hav-
ing a quiet dinner with the wife and
kiddies at Hillside Terrace.

But all of these fine young men
have so much to be thankful for, be-
cause they are fortunate enough to
attend the college of colleges, the
top of the educational heap, Wash-
ington and Lee University.

Let us then think for a moment,
friends, all of that we at Washington
and Lee have to be thankful for.

First of all, we are thankful for
our rational and temperate profes-
sors, those men who have dedicated
their lives and fortunes to academic
freedom, to guiding us along the
path of truth, to setting for us an ex-
ample of unimpassioned inquiry.

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

For freedom of speech, for oppor-
tunity to express dissenting opinions,
for freedom of the press.

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

For coats and ties, for discovering
the truth that “As a man looketh, so
is he.”

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

We are grateful for the many De-
partments at Washington and Lee
that teach us trades, for those that
protect us from an impractical edu-
cauion

For this we thank Lee. O Lord.

Thankful are we for warm rela-
tions with faculty members, those
men who rise above ‘student vs. fac-
ulty’ to act as individual men at
whatever coat.

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

We are thankful for the many pro-
feasors who provide such outstand-

Mindel Views W&L’s “Non-activism”

directly involve and relate to the
entire student body. On the contrary,
our very size seems to make it all
the more imperative that we place a
high premium on internal matters,
for we are so directly influenced by
them. The only valid criticism that
may be lodged is that we are so con-
cerned with our own society that we
have lost objectivity, that we have
become short-sighted to the point of
obscuring and losing sight of other
issues more meaningful and far-
reaching than those of our own aca-
demic community. Is this the case
with the Vietnam issue?

W&L differs most obviously from
other campuses, especially some of
the larger ones, because of the fact
that we are not involved in any
campus-wide movements such as
rallies, teach-ins or pickets. There
appear to exist three basic reasons
for this situation. Number one, W&L
is somewhat isolated, both geographi-
cally and also ideologically with re-
spect to the mainstream of national
attitudes. We are one step removed
from most of the people and events
that dominate daily news. We are not
jolted with each minor fluctuation
of the barometer of daily events—
and thus it would be foolish to ex-
pect that we respond in the exact
same fashion as other schools which
are more directly involved. Number
two, we are a small school which is
characterized by close personal re-
lations; each student in some way
feels that he is a part of Washing-
ton and Lee and as such does not
require anything external to exper-
ience a sense of belonging.

Students here do not need a
“cause” to express or defend them-
selves; this is done each day through
one’s personal relations with friends
and professors. Number three, the
general outlook of W&L is unques-
tionably conservative. Student values
are still one of the most powerful
influencing forces, and the prevalent
attitude is anti-movement, anti-pro-
test, even anti-enthusiasm. Any im-
petus towards demonstrations or
other enthusiastic expressions are
usually stifled by a permeating at-
titude of indifference to this type of
activity. Rabble rousers and dema-
gogues are ostracized.

But what does all this means? I
said there was a general indifference
to mass mevements and the like—
but I did not say there was a general
indifference to the issues themselves.
This is a point which must be over-
looked. There does indeed seem to
be a general concern, even a gener-
al familiarity, with the same issues
which predominate in other student
groups. A recent poll on the Vietnam
crisis reflected this same thought.

* B. S.
% By TOM CARPENTER

Fall sports have now officially
ended, and all the Washington and
Lee teams had succesful seasons ex-
cept the varsity football team. The
gridders dropped their sixth game
Saturday as opposed to only three
wins. You can bet that Coach Lee
McLaughlin is glad that this dismal
season is over at last. Game after
game McLaughlin watched more of
his players get racked up to the
extent that they were of little or no
use to the team from then on. Satur-
day was no exception. I ran into
four of the players Sunday, and to
look at them one would think that
they had been in an automobile ac-
cident. Billy Andrews looked like
someone ran over his face with a
pair of cleats, Jamie Andrew had
his arm in a sling, Tow Day walked
like Gimpy, Jim Large was in a
neck brace, and Andy Bloom had a
broken hand. It would be question-
able that McLaughlin could field 11
healthy players for another game.

Speaking of Bloom, I must say that
I am sorry that I will not be around
to watch him develop into another
“Johnny Unitas.” Against Washing-
ton University Saturday Bloom did
an amazing thing despite two handi-
caps. Andy threw 31 passes and
completed 18 for more than 230
yards. He did this despite not hav-
ing the availability of his pet target
Rob Reading and despite the fact
that he broke his right hand in the
first quarter of the game. He has
two more years at W&L and should
by the time he graduates have set
some kind of passing record here. He

may become the “man with the
golden arm.”
Anthony Sets Record
John Anthony seems to have

broken the school record for most
yards rushing in a single season.
John added 122 against Washington
to run his total for the year to 915
yards in 197 carries. This is more
than 200 yards better than Walt
Michael’s total the year the All-
American fullback led the Generals
to the Gator Bowl. Although the
record are incomplete, it seems very
unlikely that anyone has ever done
any better than Anthony.

Actually the biggest news in sports
on this campus deals with touch
football. In the tough intramural
league the championship ended with
the Phi Delts on top, although they
were not particularly happy about
it. The story goes like this. The
Kappa Sigs won the title game on
first downs after the score ended,
7-7. But the game was replayed

when the Phi Delts protested and |
won on the grounds that a crucial
penalty against the Kappa Sigs had
been improperly marked off, costing
the Phi Delts 15 yards that were
rightfully theirs. The Phi Delts won
the replay on first downs after a
0-0 seore. Neither team was satis-
fied with these results. The Phi
Delts won a tainted trophy, while
the Kappa Sigs believe that the
trophy should have been theirs. In
any event, no one believes that the
title game should be decided by first
downs. Let’s solve this problem by
playing a sudden death overtime un-
til a champion decided. First
downs are made by luck in so many
cases anyway. With first down and
one yard to go a first down is al-
most a certain thing. It seems ludi-
crous to decide a championship on
first downs.

Burns Gets the Ax

Anson Mount’s “Coach of the
Year” did not even make it through
the year as head coach of Iowa. He
was fired last Tuesday, but he did
coach the Hawkeyes to their ninth
defeat in ten games. Mount picked
Burns as the nation’s top collegiate
football coach and Iowa as a team
that would win nine of its ten games.
The Hawkeyes didn’t even get one
victory in Big Ten play.

In order to get some rest I am
going to initiate a new policy on
the Tuesday sports page. Anyone

bowing to Washington University of
St. Louis, 34-22, on the winners
field. The defeat left Washington and
Lee with three wins and 6 losses, its
worst record since 1958 when the
Generals were one and seven.
Washington University jumped off
to a 7-0 lead on Monge’s one yard
plunge and McCarthy’s successful
placement after the touchdown. Then
in the second period the Bears in-
creased their lead to 20-0 with two
touchdown passes. One went for 17
yards from Goodman to Wells, while
the other was for 23 yards from

Chance Questions Policies

were able to install viable govern-
ments dedicated to the establishment
of democratic institutions. These
governments were able to maintain
the independence of their respective
nations because they enjoyed the
support of the majority of their peo-
ple. Is this the situation in South
Vietnam? Have the successive gov-
ernments there even demonstrated a
capacity to achieve stability? Have
not these governments in fact been
“models” of tyranny, repression and
stagnation?

And there are those who suggest
that should South Vetnam fall, all
Asia would quickly follow. I simply
ask: “How do they intend to bring
the War in South Vietnam to a suc-
cessful conclusion? How do they
propose to stop infiltration of com-
munist troops or communist domi-
nated nations for more than six hun-

dred miles? In short, the loss of
South Vietnam does not offer the
Communists a single stragetic ad-

vantage to the eventual domination
of all of South-east Asia.

So the malady will linger on; more
Americans will be killed, and South
Vietnam will continue to be indis-
criminately and callously ravaged.

Conservatism Or A pathy?
(Continued from page 2)

The point seems to be that W&L stu-
dents are concerned and caught up
in these more significant and mean-
ingful issues; only it is manifested
in forms other than campus-wide
movements. There are still the dis-
cussions, the debates and the articles;
it is just that these rarely get fur-
ther than the personal or semi-per-
sonal level.

The most important thing seems to
be the manner in which any individ-
ual is committed to a certain view-
point, and the process through which
this is arrived, rather than merely
the form of this commitment, The
fact that one student actively demon-
strates does not automatically make
his commitment more honest, more
real, or more valid from that of an-
other, who refrains from mass move-
ments, although this can occasional-
ly be the case.

There are two ways of viewing
W&L’s “non-activism” and _ both
come down to the nature of the indi-
viduals commitment. If a W&L man’s
commitment is arrived at honestly,
with a realistic acknowledgement of
all the factors and viewpoints invol-
ved, and is the result of serious and
challenging thought, then I contend
that it is as significant and mean-
ingful as that of any active demon-
strator. Yet on the other hand, if our
isolation has prevented, or even ob-
secured a realistic confrontation and
appraisal of the issues, then perhaps
we are to be criticized, and perhaps
a few demonstrations would be in
order.

then appropriate dress may change.
Notice that there are no_ specific

than that dress be appropriate.

At Washington and Lee, Conven-
tional Dress became another ele-
ment in the status game. Dress be-
came a devotion of the label watch-
ers. The artificial hierarchy of a
Brooks shirt over a Gant made dress
more than the concern of the indi-
vidual. Those who were disenchant-
ed withdrew from the style contest.

The distortion of the gentleman
concept at Washington and Lee has
emphasized the surface demonstra-
tion of value at the cost of the
deeper human value. The tendency
is to reject a thing if you cannot
buy it, wear it, drink it, drive it
or go to bed with it.

For those who protect us against

We are thankful for the wonderful,

For this we thank Lee, O Lord.

For the high sense of honor set
