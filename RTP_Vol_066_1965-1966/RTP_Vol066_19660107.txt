Old Co-op To Be Renovated, Enlarged

36-Week, $100,000
Project Begins Soon

The administration announced this week the commence-
ment of $100,000 program of renovation and new construc-
tion on the long-empty Old Co-op building.

According to Mr. James W. Whitehead, Assistant to the
President for Administration, work on the building will begin
sometime this month. One hundred and eighty working days

‘Dog’ Thomas
Entertains At
Moose Lodge

Rufus “Walking the Dog” Thomas
will entertain guests at the annual
University Cocktail Party of the
Fancy Dress weekend, Joe Miller,
President of the dance, announced
yesterday. The well-known enter-
tainer will perform at the Friday af-
ternoon affair at the Moose Lodge
from 4 to 6.

The announcement that Thomas
would play added a note of en-
couragement to what Miller called a
rather disappointing rental of cos-
tumes for the formal dance Friday
night, January 29. “A few have been
rented, but the turnout hasn't been
as great as we had hoped,’ com-
mented Miller.

Oak Hall of Reanoke, the dance’s
costumers, have already visted the
campus once, before the Christmas
vacation. Although the visit was an-
nounced as the final chance to ob-
tain costumes, another opportunity
will be provided when they return
next Wednesday, January 12.

In keeping with the “Derby Day”
theme, such outfits as Kentucky
gentlemen, jockeys, and others will
be offered at prices starting at $6.50.
Miller emphasized again that no one
will be admitted to the dance with-
out either a costume or full formal
dress: white tie and tails.

Miller reported that this year’s
dance set will feature two firsts: It
will be the first time in four years
that there has been any choice in
costumes—the last dances have re-
volved around Civil War themes.
Also for the first time in four years,
extensive decorations will be used
for the Ball. Miller said that the
committee will have professional
help when they begin the decorating
of the Dining Hall Sunday.

The signing of Thomas completes
the lineup of entertainment for the
weekend, which features Stan Rubin
at Friday's ball and Nina Simone

 

and Ian and Sylvia at the Satur-
day night concert.

The portion of the Student Union
building now occupied by the co-op
will be used to permit increased

The Old Co-op building as it now
stands between McCormick Library
and the Old Freshman Dorm will be
remodeled to hold the snack bar and
store. An extension will be added at
the rear of the building and will be
used for general-category books.

The basement of the original build-
ing, connecting by a stairway with
the new extension (see drawing at
left) will serve as the textbook room
of the bookstore.

The door and stairs now located at
the side of the original building
will be removed and replaced by a
window. The facade of the new addi-
tion will duplicate the red brick and
white pilaster of the rest of the
structure.

Air conditioning will be installed
for the entire building.

The project will be carried out by

Fancy Dress?

Fancy Dress, renowned as the South’s Outstanding Social
Function, may not be so fancy this year; in fact, unless student
interest reverses, it may not draw enough people to fill a good-
size fraternity basement, much less Evans Dining Hall.

Thus far costume sales have totaled less than 100. Of the
students fitted by the Oak Hall Rental Agency before Christ-
mas, close to half included members of the figure or other of-
ficials for the ball. The miserable response to the fitting seems
clear indication of our student body’s bubbling school spirit.

In the past Fancy Dress marked the zenith of the Univer-
sity’s year. Presidency of the occasion was paralleled only by
chief executive of the student body. To hear a student mention
that he did not plan to date for the weekend was rare. Yet this
picture has completely changed. Why?

The quality of the weekend as far as entertainment and
decorations has not diminished nor has the work which goes
into planning Fancy Dress. The change has come in student
opinion. Most credit the change to a shifting of values within
the student body citing (1) more emphasis on academic work
and less on social, and (2) more sophistication within our com-
munity which makes attending Fancy Dress the “out” thing
to do. We tend to believe the second is the most accurate
justification for Fancy Dress’s decline but question the use of
the word sophistication. Snobbery, we believe, is a more ap-
plicable term.

Some feel that attending Fancy Dress lowers their “‘stud-
image’’ rating, and any occasion which draws together all mem-
bers of the student body must be designed for the “fish” and
not for them. This feeling of superiority is doing the Univer-
sity no good nor is it helping the individual who is THAT
concerned about how others view him. Yet this type attitude
cripples any and all attempts to draw the University’s students
together.

Many wish to call Fancy Dress a tradition and as a tradition
it must go. We feel people who attack traditions per se are
doing themselves a personal injustice. True, they lack meaning
to many who simply reject their existence without attempting
to examine or experience their value. Although it may seem
obvious to most, it should be noted that Washington and Lee
is considered a great institution not simply because we have
one of the top faculties in the nation, but also because the
University has been able to create something in addition to
(spirit maybe?) classroom classics.

Costumes will go on sale again next Wednesday in the stu-
dent union. We seriously doubt if many students will bother to
be fitted despite the fact this year’s prices are the lowest in his-
tory and this year’s weekend has the ingredients of excellence.
Many just are not interested in looking outside their own world.
Yet it is still nice to dream that possibly this year would reverse
the trend, this year would see the whole student body mixing
and laughing together, and this year would restore some of the
intangible qualities that have made Washington and Lee.

“What Does W@L Lack Most?”

 

This is the second of a series of
features designed to examine
Washington and Lee from the crit-
ical point of view of the student
body. Each writer answers the
question, “What does W&L lack
most?”

By BRUCE RIDER

There may have been, years ago,
something known as Washington and
Lee University, a place where stu-
dents were gentlemen, spoke to each
other, dressed decently, and acted
honorably. At this University there
may have been a certain atmosphere,
a certain creative spirit which serv-
ed to develop what was known as
the Washington and Lee man.

If such a University ever did ex-
ist, it is nowhere to be found in 1966.
Most certainly there have been and

It was most pleasant to be greeted
back to school by four of my favorite
M. B. E..s_ this
week. The Beatles
came to town in
Help! their grand
color movie. One
of the most signi-

. i curs at the begin-
ning when we see
the four Beatles
each going into a
separate door of
their house. The
house is a normal,
two-story red-brick affair, in a typi-
cal British industrial suburb. Across
the street, two women wave to them
and comment, “They’re still the same
as they was. Adoration hasn’t gotten
to their heads one jot.” Thus we have
the exterior image of the Beatles.

 

 

But as the film continues, we see
that the four houses are completely
different inside. They are one huge
room with a rising theatre organ,
several vending machines, and a
sunken bed for John. In short, a

world of fantasy.
In this world we can have any-

forts have not been at all success-
ful. Concerned critics have set forth
that if only students wore their ties,
if only students spoke on the cam-
pus, if only students honored the
University traditions—then, they say,
Washington and Lee would again
be its old fine self. But the spirit of
this University, whatever it was that
caused men to value its life and tra-
ditions, has died. No forcing of
obedience to rules, no patchwork at-
tempts to imitate the old way, will
bring back what has ceased to exist.

Today’s University is no longer
concerned with the development of
the whole man. Gone are the men in
the college administration and the
professors who valued the creative

traditions of the University, who
sought to share with the young-
er men an understanding of an

honorable way of life. Today’s

ination and 2) money. Is anything
dreary, stale, flat and unprofitable?
The Beatles will transform it to
something gay and lissome. As in
HARD DAY’S NIGHT they trans-
form a dreary baggage car by their
singing, so they imbue to the world
a sense that the truly marvellous life
is the imagination within.

In the same way that the Beatles
lent enchantment to the dreary world
of Liverpool, they have transformed
the image of Britain and set the tone
of youthful stylishness for the teen
generation.

The style is one of endless enter-
prise and inexhaustable industry
which threatens to tire towards the
end. Throughout the film there is a
visual quality and as _ thoughtless
and carefree as the singing itself.
Everything is lighthearted, every-
thing is played for laughs. During
the opening titles we see the Beatles
perform in faded black and white
while brightly colored darts and the
titles are thrown on the screen. Dur-
ing the Ticket to Ride sequence, we
see bizarre images of them clowning

men simply do their jobs—and they
do their jobs well as administrators
and academic teachers—but they do
not bother about the quality of life,
the quality of the individual, at this
University.

As students, we do not take par-
ticular pride in being Washington
and Lee men. The very idea of a
“Washington and Lee man” is for
us a meaningless concept. We are

so that we can get an adequate job
and raise an adequate family and
live an adequate life.

We have no sense of being a part
of a real community, of sharing a

 

historic past, of having anything in

 

Washington and Lee In 1966

common with men who have been
Washington and Lee men before us.
A few weeks ago the student body
had an opportunity to discuss Wash-
ington and Lee life with members of
the Self-Study committee. No stu-
dent attended the first meeting; four
came to the second. What’s in it for
Big Me?

We students today are much too
smart, too self-assured, too grown
up to concern ourselves with such
a useless thing as the quality of
University life. All of this is, at best,
unsophisticated, and who among us
would like to be thought unsophisti-
cated at the mature ages of nine-
teen or twenty-two?

What is wrong with Washington
and Lee University in 1966? Nothing,
really. Or everything. The academic
institution will continue to thrive.
Each year we admit better-prepared
and more intelligent students, and
the quality of education continues
to improve. The emphasis increas-
ingly will be on the academic—we
have little time or use for anything
else.

It is obvious that today’s student
at Washington and Lee is not partic-
ularly a gentleman, not particularly
well-spoken, not particularly neat,
not particularly honorable. But he
is well educated and he will do
well for himself in the big wide

world.

Let us pause, though, if only for
a moment, to remember that once
there was a creature known as the

Editor Discusses Trivia--What’s New?

By CHARLIE BENSINGER
Dear Mom and Dad:

Remember when the rage was how
many students could fit into a VW
or phone booth?
Or the frisbie? Or
sidewalk surfing?
Now it is the mi-
nutiae, trivia, and
for lack of any-
thing better to do
we shall turn to
trivia within the
world of baseball
(spring training is
only three months

 

Bensinger away). :
One note, first:
I will not comment on the NFL

Championship for two reasons. First,
Piedmont Airlines had me flying all
afternoon. The first three airports
were fogged in and we made it to
Winston-Salem on gas fumes. Sec-
ond, I am a loyal Cleveland fan.

How many of you know the wild-
est pitch ever thrown in the major
leagues? Chuck Stobbs, the old
Washington southpaw, once threw
his curve ball twenty-six rows up
into the grandstand, and closer to
first base than to home. If there are
any doubts about the veracity of the
sage, ask Tom Carpenter. He was
there. Stobbs’ explanation, however,
is the true classic: it slipped.

The only pitcher in the history of
the World Series ever to lose a
ground ball in the sun and as a
result, the ball game, was the famous
Dodger Billy Lowes. Somehow I
think that Billy must have been put-
ting on the scribes.

The record for hitting into the
most outs in one nine inning game
belongs to Burleigh Grimes, another
Dodger of course. In three at bats
Grimes hit into two double plays
and one triple play—seven outs. Oh
yes, he also lost the game.

Question: who was the only man
ever to pinch-hit for Ted Williams?

Wrestlers Upset West Va.;
Patterson, Andrew, Raker
Score Wins For Generals

Coach Dick Miller wishes to thank
members of his varsity wrestling
team for his Christmas present: a
21-11 upset victory over West Vir-
ginia University. It may have come

a little early, on December 17, but
he really appreciates it.
The Generals got off to a quick

start as West Virginia forfeited to
Randy Roper at 123, but lost part of
their lead as Jim Bruton was de-

cisioned by the Mountie captain Don
Check. Kem White also won five
points by forfeit, and Don Patterson
followed up by scoring three points
in the last period for a 3-1 decision,
increasing the Generals’ lead to 13-3,

Charlie Slaughter and Bob Mun-
son, both promising freshmen, lost
close decisions, Jamie Andrew
came through with a win. Jay Clarke
then fought to a 1-1 draw, insuring
W&L of the victory, and Holmes
Raker put the icing on the cake with
a win at the heavyweight position,

Coach Miller expects only two
changes in this line-up for the R-P.I
match tonight at 7:00 in Doremus.
Rollie Jacobs, a winner his only time
out, will start at 123, and either
Dave Jackson or Mike McCreery will
gain the nod at 137

The Generals, with a 1-1 record
will be out to move over the 500
mark against a team that they have
beaten 40-0 two years in a row. It
can't happen this year, however,

Answer: Carroll Hardy.

The shortest home-run on rec-
ord? This great blow traveled the
fantastic distance of six inches. Don’t
ask who hit it because I don’t re-
member, but it was on a cloudy day
and happened on a very muddy field.
The pitch was topped into the mud in
front of home plate, unbeknown to
everyone, except the batter. Before
the ball could be found, he had
scored, Needless to say, you may not
believe this one, but if you will let
me know, upon my return from
spring vacation (yes, I plan to come
back) I will bring the book of won-
ders.

Not so trivial is the problem of
Fancy Dress. As usual there are the
guys who make it tough for all
others—they have two dates too
many. They ditch two and thought-
lessly don’t give them to the guys
without. Of course, in the true
Charlie Brown spirit, half of these
guys will find out the day before
that they kept the wrong one—she
can't come.

Then there is the guy with two
girls, one at home and one at school.
Both want to come. To each Wash-
ington and Lee man with this prob-
lem, find your own solution—ours
don’t work.

A modification is the problem of
having a date at a neighboring and
then asking the girl from home, all
the time knowing that she can’t
come. It’s great for snow, but what
happens when suddenly she can
come. Even worse is the unan-
nounced arrival.

Men with problems like these of-

 

ten can’t even enjoy Fancy Dress. |
This is because they are just too}
darn tired. And as for second se- |
mester, it’s so much of a mental
down after these carnal gymnastics |
that it can be hard to stay in school |
for the next FD season. |
Now as promised last year, we will
report IM scores. That is, the ones
that we have. It seems that bowling
is an unknown quantity in a set cf

Miller Named As Finalis:
For NCAA Scholarship

Each year the National Collegiate
Athletic Association presents post-
graduate scholarships to athletes
displaying outstanding ability, lead-
ership, and scholarship. Joe Miller,
W&L’s All-State and All-CAC line-

man, was one of the ninteen finalists

in the 1965 football college division
competition.
Miller, a Delt senior from Nash-

ville, has been an outstanding mem-
ber of the team in his three years of
varsity eligibility and this year serv-
ed well as one of the General tri-
captains. In the field of academics,
Miller is a history major and this
year was nominated as one of
Washington and Lee’s three Rhodes
Scholar candidates.

Walter Byers, the Executive Di-
rector of the NCA\A, added in a letter
to Cy Twombly, who nominated Mil-
ler, that being one of the finalists
“is, in itself, a great tribute consid-

ering the number of outstanding
senior candidates across the coun-
try.”

 

Head Paces W&L Swim Team
To Victory Over West Virginia

Washington and Lee’s_ varsity
swimmers trounced West Virginia by
a score of 57-38 in the Doremus
pool last Dec. 17. The win brought
the team’s record to 3-1.

Sophomore Nelson Head was the
key man for the Generals with rec-
ord-breaking performances of 2:03.1
in the 200-yard backstroke and :56.4
in his leg of the opening medley re-
lay, which W&L took in 3:50. Head’s
teammates in that event were Pat
Costello, Bart Taylor, and Bill Clay.

Another W&L record fell as Ned
Lawrence placed second in the 500
freestyle in 5:37.3. Bill Wildrick and

Washington and Lee’s_ varsity
basketball team dropped three in a
row over the Christmas vacation on
a disappointing road trip South,
bringing their record to two wins
and eight defeats.

Plauged by fouls, the Generals lost
a squeaker to UNC of Charlotte on
December 18, 78-76. With ten min-
utes to play in the fourth quarter,
the W&L top scorers fouled out.
A W&L foul in the last seven sec-
onds of play resulted in the loss.
According to Coach Vernon Can-
field, “We should have had this one
without doubt.”

Three bad passes and two missed
layups in three minutes of play were
the cause of defeat at the hands of
Florida Presbyterian University De-
cember 20, 69-59.

Sporting fifteen boys on full schol-
arship, Florida Southern completely
outclassed the W&L squad, 93 to
59. Canfield stated that Florida
Southern is the “one big team on
our schedule. They have the eighth
le ading defense in the nation, Our

Tonight, the varsity meets Lynch-
burg College in a return match at
Lynchburg. The Generals defeated
Lynchburg December 17 by a score
of 70 to 51, holding high scorer
Wayne Proffit, whose average is now
29.2 points per game, to 14 points,
his lowest this year. Canfield specu-

be able to take them.”

“On this recording the horn of
Paul Horn is emphasized...but in
the background. If you listen care-
fully, there is the ascending, de-
manding stairway of voices—each
announcing to the world his creed
and yet doing this in the midst of
his fellows. A dream exists in which
this is done in a cathedral and for
once each man is on his own and
shouting musically to his God what
he believes...yet in community,
which is the desire of the world
today.” |
Frightening Religious Intensity |
The effect of this crescendo is one
of almost frightening religious in-
tensity. At least, that was my own
reaction; another listener apparent-
ly interpreted it as stereophonic gen-
ocide. My real concern, however, is
not with this composition as such,
but with the whole field of new and
venturesome religious music—par-

Five other Generals—plus Barclay
and Sydnor—received at least one
vote to gain a place on the honor-
able mention teams. Barclay was

named to the offensive unit at end,
and Sydnor was moved over a posi- |
tion to defensive guard.

Tackles Jack Kelly and Charlie
Mayer, and center Bill Sledge were
the Generals’ additional represen-
tatives on the honorable mention of-

Miller and halfback Billy Andrews
were chosen on the defensive “men-
tion” team.

ticularly in the jazz idiom, which
is a logical and potentially effective
vehicle for modern worship. Why
does the very idea fall upon deaf
ears?

The tragic answer is that tradi-
tional music makes everyone feel
comfortable. Within limits, of course,
this is fine; security is a universal
function of religion, and change for
its own sake is meaningless. As a
guiding force, however, “comfort” is
a travesty of the challenge which re-
ligion can and should put forth. And
while mere musical concerns are not
infallible indicators, they do have a
strong relevance; external practices
can provide interesting and some-
times disturbing clues to the internal
state of a community.

The Dream
And so, brethern, I have a dream.
It is Sunday morning in a large
Protestant church, and time for the
anthem, which is listed as “Variations
on ‘The Old Rugged Cross.’” But
the choir is not there. Instead, twelve

avant-garde composers arise and

begin their own anthem. Ten sing
“Glory to God!” in five different
keys; one plays an improvised alto
axophone solo; the other bounces
well-tempered tennis balls off the
pulpit.

Of the five hundred people pres-
ent, 475 run sereaming out of the
wnctuary. The remaining 25 watch
in fascination as a uniquely creative
and personal affirmation of faith un-
folds them

The anthem ends, and all is silent.
Then from the distance a Voice
speaks to the remnant, saying, “This
is My church; and I am well pleased.
Now +t down to business
around here.”
