Self- “Study Talks Scheduled

On Aspects Of Student Life

Assistant Dean of Students Lewis, ity to comment on any topic, to raise
G. John, analyst for the University’s | questions, and offer suggestions for
self-study appraisal of Student Life, | further consideration by the Self-
will conduct open discussions on this | Study committee or the analyst.

topic next week for interested fac- |
ulty members and students.

Dean John will meet with faculty |

and staff members at 7:30 p.m. on
Monday, December 13, in Newcomb
8.

Dean John’s meetings with stu-
dents are scheduled for 2:15 p.m.
on Tuesday, December 14, and for
7:30 p.m. on Wednesday, December
15, both sessions in Newcomb 8.

A 12-page summation of material
on the Student Life section of the
Self-Study is being distributed by
Dean John to faculty and to stu-
dents. Copies have been mailed to
student leaders, and individual stu-
dents interested in having copies of
the summary can obtain them in Mr.
Parsons’ office on the third floor of
Washington Hall.

The summary deals with all as-
pects of student life except social
fraternities, a sub-section still un-
der study by a special sub-commit-
tee. Covered in the Student Life
major category are student govern-
ment, the Honor System, orientation
and counseling, student discipline,
religious life, student publications,
intercollegiate and intramural ath-
leties, student health services, extra-
class physical facilities, and extra-
class student activities.

The purpose of Dean John’s open
discussion is to provide faculty and
students a chance to examine the
general approach the Self-Study
committee has made to Student Life,
the questions that have been raised,
and the various recommendations
that have been suggested in the
course of the discussions. Faculty
and students will have an opportun-

 

The summaries distributed so far

and Administration, the College, and
Student Life are not summaries of
the final reports on these sections,
but represent summaries of material
and on subsequent material gathered
through the open discussions, anal-
ysts will then prepare drafts of their
report sections of the final Self-
Study Report.

 

 

Joe Miller, president of Fancy
Dress Weekend, has announced that
Nina Simone, pianist and _ singer,
will appear with Ian and Sylvia at
the Saturday evening concert, Jan-
uary 30.

Miss Simone, one of the “most
listened to” popular folk singers for
the past six years, is especially noted
for her ballads and blues, which she
sings in Old English, Israeli, and
other ethnie styles. Her haunting
voice, as she accompanies herself
on the piano, has been described
as “among the most distinctive.” Her
background was primarily classical,
but her talent for improvisation and
an interest in jazz assured her suc-
cess when she first appeared in a
nightclub in Atlantic City in the
summer of 1959. She studied piano
under Carl Friedberg at the Jul-
liard School of Music in New York.

Speaking of her in Down Beat
magazine, critic John Wilson com-
mented that “she is not, of course,
#exactly a jazz performer—or, pos-
sibly, one should say that she is
much more than a jazz performer,
for her piano playing certainly has
jazz colorations—but she is an ex-
citing entertainer.”

Ranking highest in popularity
among the more than two dozen al-
bums which she has recorded are
“Nina at Town Hall,” “Nina at the
Village Gate,” “Nina at Newport,”
“Nina at Carnegie Hall,” “Nina in
Concert,” “Don’t Let Me Be Mis-
understood,” “Broadway, Blues, and
Ballads,” “Love Me or Leave Me,”
“Folksy Nina,” “Nina Sings El-
lington,” “Forbidden Fruit.”

Ian and Sylvia, Canada’s most
notable folk singers and folk com-
posers, will round out the concert.
Their original composition, “Four
Strong Winds,” has become a stand-
ard | in the folk field. “Un Canadien

University Christmas Programs

The Foreign Language Christmas
Sing, the John A. Graham Brass
Choir, and the Christmas Candle-
light Service will provide Christmas
entertainment for the student body
before vacation.

The eighteenth annual Foreign
Language Christmas Sing is sched-
uled for 5 p.m. on Wednesday, Dee.
15, in the Lee Chapel. The program
is being prepared by students in
the foreign language classes which
emphasize conversational aspects. To
make the program more lively, the
audience is also encouraged to par-
ticipate vocally. Texts of all the songs

will be given out to those attending |
so that they may sing along with |

the language students.

Naturally the stress will be on
Christmas songs, but there will also
be traditional songs, folk and popu-
lar songs, drinking songs, students
songs, tongue twisters and nonsense
songs. The text will provide ex-
planatory notes to _help those not

Costumes To Be Available
Next Monday and Tuesday

Errant,’ another original, has been
called “the most carefully wrought
musical work, the most meaningful,
the most significant to come out of
the current interest in folk.” They
have become one of the country’s
most sought-after concert and night-
club attractions.

Roy Tyler, vice-president in charge
of costumes, reminds students that
costumes for the Ball can be rented
on Monday and Tuesday of next
week from 9 to 4, in the Student
Union. Jockey costumes, Kentucky
Gentleman outfits, and numerous
others in keeping with the “Derby
Day” theme will be available. The
dance’s costumers, Oak Hall of Roa-
noke, have also agreed to rent out
any other costumes in their stock—
Spanish dancers, for example, and
several animal costumes, such as
lions, tigers, pussy cats, and even
gorillas. Tyler added that since the
themes of Fancy Dress for the four

years past have been Civil-War-ori-g —————_____-

ented, such costumes will have to be
specially requested.

Costumes will be available on one
more occasion, after Christmas, but
students are advised that rentals
will be on a first-come basis, and
with the large number of students
anticipated to attend the Ball, Tyler
commented that as many students as
possible should take advantage of
next week's fittings. Students not
in costumes will be required to wear
full dress—white tie; tuxes will not
be acceptable dress. Rental prices for
costumes will begin at $6.50.

 

Governor Smylie To Speak
Tuesday Night In Chapel;
YR Dinner Also Planned

Governor Robert E. Smylie of Ida-
ho will speak Tuesday, December 14
at 8:00 p.m. in Lee Chapel. His topic
has not yet been announced.

The Governor is currently Chair-
man of the National Republican
Governors’ Association.

The tentative schedule calls for a
press conference immediately upon
his arrival at Woodrum field in Roa-
noke Tuesday afternoon. Following
the press conference, he will proceed
to Lexington where he will meet
briefly with the Mock Convention
Coordinating Committee before at-
tending an informal dinner with the
officers of the Young Republican
Club. He will speak at 8:00 in Lee
Chapel.

Governor Smylie, having originally
taken office in 1954, has been re-
elected twice since, thus casting him
into the position of senior Governor
in the United States.

Monday, Governor Smylie will in-
troduce a formal resolution to the
Republican Coordinating Committee
to disassociate itself with «¢ extremist.

“More than just

The EC voted Tuesday night to
submit the question of whether W&L
should join the National Student
Association to a student referendum
and discussions by the newly-organ-
ized ODK Leadership Forum in Feb-
ruary.

The action was taken as the result

members as to the wisdom of joining
the organization without consulting
student opinion.

Gayner, representing the W&L chap-
ter of Young Americans for Free-
dom, a conservative group, appeared
before the EC at Tuesday's meeting
to state their objections to the na-
tional organization.

NSA's political views had pre-
viously been attacked by a letter
from Wainscott in the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi, in which he stated that
“the major issue of NSA is politics,
not education,” and added that
“(Mindel) did not bother to tell the
EC, apparently, some facts which
probably should be considered.”

It was made clear at the meeting
however, that Mindel had discussed
NSA's political stands with the EC
in its meeting on Nov. 31. Wain-
scott apologized, saying that he had
been unawere of this discussion.

In reply to other objections, Min-
del pointed out that the organiza-
tion's resolutions on international
affairs make up only a very small
minority of the resolutions adopted
annual congress, while the
majority deal with purely campus

 

issues
He added that schools which do
not agree on an issue adopted by

EC Calls Student Referendum

On National Student Association

the Congress are not required to as-
sociate themselves with any given
resolution, but can instead associate
with other dissenting schools in a
minority report.

“We've got to be heard,” he said.
“We're doing nothing by just sitting
back. . . . I don’t think it can pos-
sibly hurt to get in, especially in
light of the valuable services which
the association can render; a fact
which no one in the EC disputes.”

Stating that “many of the assump-
tions and statements in Mr. Wains-
cott’s letter are not true and that
the true facts will be brought out
shortly.” he also said, “This is the
type of issue which must be looked
into carefully. It's a much more com-
plex subject than first appears.”

On suggestion of sophomore rep-
resentative Richard Nash, the dis-
cussion by the ODK forum and the
referendum will be put off until
after Feb. 1, in order that all the
facts may be adequately presented
and so that Christmas and exami-
nations are out of the way.

Two speakers are to be brought
to the Forum to debate whether
W&L should join the NSA. NSA has
already expressed its willingness to
send a representative to any pros-
pective member school, while the
Young Americans for Freedom chap-
ter has agreed to obtain a suitable
conservative speaker to discuss the
disadvantages of membership.

In further action Tuesday night
the EC heard Library Committee
chairman Randy Chitwood’s report
on the committee's plans for a used
book market to be established at the
end of the semester.

Examinations Flexibility

Monday’s action by the faculty changing the automatic
rules must be lauded as a giant step forward in granting Wash-
ington and Lee students more academic responsibility. This
move, coupled with last year’s action liberalizing the cut sys-
tem, leads the Ring-tum Phi to believe that the faculty views
today’s student body as possessing a more mature attitude than
those in the past.

In this same spirit we would like to suggest that the faculty
consider a possible change in the examination system. Under
the present system our exams are placed in a rigid schedule
which allows no flexibility. This academic Russian-roulette
each year cost many students marginal grades and to a large
extent leads to examination frustration.

Since the computer considers the course numbers only, and
not the individuals involved, many schedules come out look-
ing like endurance races with a semi-vacation tucked in between
the laps.

Many factors enter into getting “up” for an exam and
these factors differ with as many students are are taking a
particular course. Some would rather “grind it out” for a short
period while others prefer to pace themselves and still others
prefer short sprints with rest inserted. Also in grouping exams
most students like either all their tough courses first, last, or
sprinkled among easier courses. Invariably many students are
not matched with their “‘styles.’’

It is theoretically true that students should study during the
entire semester and exams should present no problem, but not
many either in the student body or faculty can claim that exams
have not caused cram sessions during their academic careers. In
fact, by the senior year many students add and drop courses on
the basis of their exam schedule.

In an age when academic excellence can spell the differ-
ence between success and failure, acceptance and rejection,
a better program at W&L could be worked out.

Washington and Lee is nationally known for its honor
system. Why should we require specific periods for exams?
Randolph-Macon, for example, allows students to take their
exam anytime during the exam period. Other schools offer
two or three sessions during which an exam can be taken.
Why are these systems not applicable here?

Many would argue that it causes complex grading prob-
lems. Consider the present system which puts the entire load on
professors who teach several sections of a course which has its
exam on the last, or next-to-last day. The natural “‘style”’ of the
individual student, it seems to us, will create a better distribu-
tion than the present system. Who wants five tests on the last
three days? If anything it will encourage students to take their
tests early to give themselves a longer vacation.

Now look at the exam schedule belowe and decide if it pro-
vides the flexibility you would like if you had your choice.
Then, please check the questionnaire and drop it by the Ring-
tum Phi office with any comments you wish to make. Your
responses will be given to Dean Atwood.

(See preference box page 4)

Beunlaction Schedule

January 17, 1966 through January 27, 1966

It is the responsibility of each student to know the time and place of meet-
ing of each of his examinations. The hours for examinations are 9:00-12:00
and 2:00-5:00. Any student more than five minutes late must present a satis-
factory reason for his lateness to be allowed to take the examination.

The omission by a student of any regular examination causes him to for-
feit his place in the class and to receive grade F for the semester, unless he
is excused for reasons deemed sufficient by the Dean and instructor con-
cerned.

Fraternal Vacuum Captured By Artist

 

By KAZ HERCHOLD

Within the vacuum tube that con-
stitutes a college community, reality
at best only illuminates the outer
limits of the college man’s waking
hours. The trappings of a life re-
moved and cloistered for four years
from the real world appear con-
spicuously not only in a man’s sen-
sibility, but all over the physical
plant in which he moves.

The sears of high-powered party
weekends where inebriation is the
price of peace are etched forever into
the walls of fraternity houses. “All-
nighters” owe their existence to mis-
direction in the never ending search
for academic bliss. No-Doz, dex,
Piping Rock, Jack Daniels, or any-
thing which produces equivalent de-
sired effects compose the average
student's survival kit. And the car-
icatures which dot fraternity house
dining room walls perhaps most
uniquely portray in one great mont-
age effect what Joe College is all
about.

The caricatures serve a purpose far
beyond that of the feeble efforts of
self styled interior decorators. Fra-
ternity men can effectively use them
to impress rushees, terrorize dates,
and shock mothers. And the man
responsible for the scintillating art
work is a bearded Dutchman, named
Pol Van Geel.

Pol, who visits Washington and
Lee every two years, started out as
a musician. After an abortive fling
at that profession, he began studying
art at Antwerp Academy. Upon
graduation, Pol drifted around Eu-
rope drawing political cartoons prior
to coming to the United States in
1938.

In 1940, completely by chance, he
encountered full-blown for the first
time, the American college world in
the person of a now anonymous
Washington and Lee Phi Gam. The
student observed Van Geel doing
caricatures at a newspaper editors’
convention in New York and in-
vited him to Lexington to immortal-

ize the well-serubbed faces of fra-

and the opportunity for biennial
ridicule of your best friend's idio-
synerasies became incorporated into
that amorphous bugaboo, known ir-
reverently as Washington and Lee
tradition.

While it all started some twenty-
five years ago at the Phi Gam house.

rors which traditionally would in-
sure the downfall of each succeeding
generation, Pol simply offers, “I
would never judge a boy by what
I see of him in college. He is abso-
lutely not willing to be overly ser-
ious about anything.” He finds no
evil in what young people do, em-
phasizing what he calls their “amaz-
ing capacity for intolerence of each
other.”

Pol’s optimism, respect, and ability
to both understand and fraternize
with the college set guarantee a
warm reception and ready accept-
ance at the campuses he visits. As
the years pass, he continues to de-
rive the greatest satisfaction from the
way in which a fraternity house wel-
comes him back.

Approximately sixty years old, Pol
now restricts his itinerary to four
schools, Denison, Ohio Wesleyan,
Bowling Green, and Washington and
Lee. Preoccupations differ in various
areas. Now both common knowledge
and Pol’s caricatures support the
proposition that the preoccupations

Frazer: “An Island Isolated Unto Itself”

By SAM FRAZIER

This article commences a series
designed to examine Washington
and Lee from the critical point
of view of the student body. Each
writer answers the question,
“What does W&L lack most?”

For a senior who, by definition, is
not long for this particular world
and who has a good time here—has
even found the non-social aspects
of W&L pleasant—writing about
what is wrong with W&L seems
a rather ungracious act. Clearly there
are a number of things which are
definitely “right” about Washington
and Lee. There are obvious things
like the honor system, some of the
traditions, and the fact that here
you can find “bright young men”
who are not so aqueous that you
would mind drinking with them

Add these qualities to a highly
competent faculty and an intelli-
gent student body and you certainly
have a “good” school. W&L’s sin
not that it has fallen short of
being a good school but that it
could have been a lot better. Wash-
ington and Lee has become too much
of an island isolated unto itself and
as such has wasted too much of the
talent and promise of its members—
both faculty and student.

It is easy to explain away this
island charge by pointing out the
W&L's geographical location makes a
certain amount of isolation unavoid-
able. However, the problem is not
primarily geographical. In fact, a
certain amount of geographical iso-
lation can be helpful to a university
by giving it a chance to stand back
and take a detached view. This sit-
uation has never been harmful to
intellectual achievement. It is es-
sential to it.

Washington and Lee's failure is
that it has never gotten concerned
enough to take that view. It has

is

| too concerned with itself,

 

simply stood back. It has been far

 

 

with the
busywork of its own existence. There
are too many things here
ant things—to keep us busy. There
is simply no time left to consider
what we are doing and why.

Two years ago Dr. Duvall made a
statement in the Ring-tum Phi that
Washington and Lee students are
quite competent at digesting infor-
mation and regurgitating it in an
organized manner on quizzes and in
papers, but a bit short on originali-
ty.

There are several reasons for this,
I think. One of them is that profes-
sors really don’t require originality.
Usually well-organized regurgitation
is quite sufficient. But when origi-
nality is required, or at least urged,
too many students simply do not
have the time to invest the amount
of reflection which originality re-
quires. An unfortunate amount of
time is consumed by what can only
be described as busywork.

Beyond this, there is simply not
the inclination to be reflective. At
least a certain amount of the work
must be done, and that means either
overt studying or sneak studying, de-
pending on the mores of the indi-
vidual’s fraternity. When the work
is done, the student feels that he
owes himself a little fun. He fills
the rest of his time with road trips
and at least two flicks a week.

There is an obvious temptation to
place all the blame on the phenom-
enon of the Washington and Lee fra-
ternity. This would be an error, I
think, for the fraternity did not
create the monster. Ii is a natural
development from it. It the at-
mosphere here, the general attitude
that is the monster.

is

This charge applies to all mem-
bers of the University. It is just as
easy for the faculty to oceupy il-
self with its committee mectings and
busy little rules as it is for atude nts

to spend their time at the Lyric and
Liquid. A case at point is the
Charles Milne Crisis last spring,

i when the faculty committee on cuts
| took the position that no matter what

the cireumstances, there could be no
exception to the cut rule.

It seems to me there should never
have been a crisis at all. One of the
arguments for the small college is
that its size allows a student to be
treated as an individual. A small
college can afford to consider the
circumstances and upon occasion
take exceptions to its rules. A large
university cannot. There is no ex-
euse for hard, fast, absolute rules
designed for the efficient adminis-
tration of 25,000 to 20,000 students
at a college of 1,300.

My argument is that we have mis-
placed values at Washington and
Lee. This University is an island in
the sense that here we have every-
thing necessary to keep up occupied,

but we have failed to consider
whether some of these things are
truly worthy of our attention. We

have coneerned ourselves with what

we are doing rather than what we
are becoming.
To be great, a university must

stand back and observe its society,
but even this self removal must be
an expression of involvement in so-
ciety. It must also be willing to stand
back and look at itself—to constant-
ly question its own direction, not just
make minor improvements.

Ships do come to islands. There
have been several encouraging re-
cent arrivals here. There are also
times when there is genuine thought
on substantative topies. This often
happens late at night after few
drinks, but it does happen even
among students. This real criticism,
then, must be that a few drinks are
usually required. As to how the
situation can be rectified. I have no
idea.

Kendrick and Bullitt)

Head 1966

Safety Bryant Kendrick and de-
fensive tackle Logan Bullitt have
been named Washington and Lee
football co-captains for 1966, mark-
ing the second year in a row that
defensive personnel have led the
Generals.

Linebackers Joe Miller and Jeff
Novinger, and defensive halfback
Billy Andrews were Generals’ tri-
captains this year.

Kendrick, a 5-10, 165-pound junior
from Greenville, S. C., was moved
to his safety post from quarterback
early this past season when W&L
began experiencing pass defense dif-
ficulties. He completed eight passes

Kendrick
Four Interceptions

of 18 attempts for 81 yards as the
Generals’ signal-caller through three
games, then turned around and in-
tercepted four opponents’ passes in
W&L’'s remaining six contests.

Bullitt, a defensive tackle through-
out the season until injuries slowed
him after W&L’s sixth game, is a
5-11, 215 pound junior from Eagles-
mere, Pa. Infrequently, he doubled as
an offensive end when mid-season
injuries hit that position.

“We couldn’t have picked better
men,” said head coach Lee Me-
Laughlin. “Both boys are outstand-
ing football players and excellent
leaders. Each showed that this past

season when they were still play-| |

ing despite injuries that should have
kept them on the bench.”

Bullitt pulled a leg muscle during

the Generals’ fourth game but con-| |

tinue to play in two or more. Ken-

drick played the entire last game|

against
spite a fractured rib and wrist.

For the moment, McLaughlin
plans to keep both players at their
present positions next season, but a
depth problem, one that’s sure to
arise since 21 players will be grad-
uated this June may force the W&L
coach to play Kendrick and Bul-
litt both ways.

“They could do it quite easily,”
said McLaughlin, “since each one has
experience on either team. They'd
have no trouble at all.”

Kendrick, a philosophy major, and
Bullitt, a history major, are two-
year lettermen with the Generals.

A second special report on the

The Washington and Lee Varsity | the backboards will be the key.

Basketball squad, currently holding!

a record of one win and two losses,
meets King College tonight in Bris-
tol, Virginia, and Centre College of

‘| Danville, Kentucky, on Saturday.

According to Head Coach Verne
Canfield, King with five wins and
one defeat, has a good match-up de-
fense built on hustle and is “scrap
py” under the boards. The King
squad is led by 67” forward Erb
Burnett who has continually scored
in the high teens, but Canfield ex-
pressed optimism, asserting that Bob
Spessard, 65” W&L captain and cen-
ter, should be able to handle him.
Once again it is felt that control of

Centre College, two and one, was
“tough” last year and has ten re-
turning lettermen this year, includ-
ing stars Mike Marks and Julian
Palmer. In last year’s home game,
Marks tallied 32 and Palmer 28 as
Centre tipped the Generals 93-80.
In the CAC tourney it was Palmer
32, Marks 29 as Centre won 105-81.
Coach Canfield stated that this
year’s game should be a “good test
for the younger boys,” referring es-
pecially to freshmen John Carrere
and Rob Bauer, both starters.

Looking at the W&L squad as a
whole, Canfield said that “their de-
sire to win is great—they really

 

The W&L wrestling teams swing
into their dual meet schedules this
weekend as both varsity and the
J.V.’s have matches against the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Dore-
mus Gym Saturday.

Last year the Generals won the
varsity match 23-10, but the U.N.C.
has a good nucleus of lettermen in
Franusiszin, Hagerty, Jacobson, and
Johnson, insuring a far tougher
match this year.

The tentative varsity line-up finds
Roper, (123), Bruton (139), White
(137), Patterson (145), Slaughter
Carter (167),
Clarke (177), and Raker (hwt.) get-
ting Coach Dick Miller’s nod.

As of the moment, the J.V. line-

up will have Jacobs at 123, Ben-
singer at 139, Johnson at 137, Mc-
Creery at 145, Payne at 152, Munson
at 160, Ridley at 167, Kennedy at 177,
and Driseoll at heavyweight. Once
again, we state that these are only
tentative line-ups and are subject
to change.

The J.V. match will start at 7:00
and varsity will follow, a close
to 8:30 as possible.
