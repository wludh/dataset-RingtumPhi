EC Evaluates Assimilation Committee

 

Griffin Discusses
Rush Books, Lists

(Editor’s Note: The IFC, which seems finally to have
found itself, has made an unusual amount of news during the
last few weeks, as sponsor of CONTACT as well as for its
often-controversial legislation on rush booklets, controls on
fraternity treasurers, and the recent ban of separate Jewish
and non-Jewish lists. IFC President Chuck Griffin comments
on some of these.)

Q. The proposal recently made before the IFC to replace
individual fraternity rush booklets with a single IFC rush book
has come under heavy fire. Why do you support this move?

A: The fraternities together spend about $12,000 on rush
booklets each year (including
the IFC booklet). To have a
combined booklet would mean
an annual savings of about
$9500. In the first place, these
figures are way out of propor-
tion—the cost is not justified.
Secondly, I don’t know of a
single fraternity that wouldn’t
benefit significantly from a sav-
ings such as this. Thirdly, since
the resulting decrease in a fra-
ternity’s exposure to incoming
freshmen would be reduced
equally with other fraterni-
ties, there is no relative change
in any one fraternity’s particu-
lar advantage.

Q: How would a standard IFC book be put together?

A: Plans have not been determined for any specific format.
However, the general idea is that a house would be given a
particular number of pages (equal for all houses) which
would be determined by the houses together, and then each

 

fraternity would be free to plan its own format—within reason-
able costs, since formats can differ as to price.

Q: Do you feel that a common rush booklet would —
to favor large, nationally-known fraternities over those less
well-known?

A: No I do not. There are several reasons. Primarily, my
reason stands on the ground that any resulting disadvantage
or advantage would be real.
ized proportionately by all
fraternities. The argument has
been advanced that a less-well
known fraternity needs an indi-
vidual rush booklet in order to
become better known. This is
not a valid argument, since the
booklets of less-well known fra-
ternities were in competition
with those of the better-known
fraternities. As a freshman
received the usual “mass” of
rush booklets, in mixed order
(e.g., first from a less-
known fraternity, and then one
from a beter-known fraternity,
and so on), he gradually lost
interest in reading them. The only way a less-known fraternity
could achieve an advantage under the present system is by
either getting its booklet out first, or by sending out a “spectac-
ular” rush booklet. Since all houses realize these two oppor-
tunities, even this is cancelled out in competition.

Q: Won't a common rush book with a limited scope for
creativity in layout, be less interesting and therefore less read
than the present booklets, which do not look alike?

A: Yes and no, They would be less interesting, since there

would obviously have to be a degree of uniformity between
the various fraternities. They would not be less read, I believe.
because the rushee would have all the houses before him under
(unlike the IFC booklet) would be
different, thus enabling the freshman to compare whatever

Campus YR’s
To Circulate
Viet Petition

Campus Young Republicans have
taken sharp issue with present ad-
ministration policy on Vietnam.

On Monday night the W&L Young
Republican Club executive commit-
tee unanimously endorsed a petition
proposed by the Clarence J. Brown
(Law School) Young Republican
Club calling for a course of action
which would carry the war to North
Vietnam with the aim of winning it
as quickly as posible

The petition will be circulated on
campus by the two clubs beginning
today and continuing through next
week. It reads as follows:

We the undersigned, believe that
to secure unconditional freedom
for the people of South Vietnam,
to repel Communist aggression, to
minimize American and Vietna-
mese casualties, and to bring about
a swift and stable peace, the United
States should, as suggested by
members of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and both Houses of Con-
Kress:

1) impose a Kenendy-like quar-
antine on North Vietnam:

2) carry the war to North Viet-
nem by maximum use of Ameri-
can conventional air power against
significant military targets—sup-

The EC launched into its second
semester program Tuesday night in
a meeting which covered various
topics, including the upcoming NSA
referendum, a report on relaxing the
rules against girls in thedorms, and
an interview with members of the
assimilation and student control
committees.

As a part of a program of general
review of committees, ‘their useful-
ness, and their success, the BC
interviewed Sam Frazier, chairman
of the assimilation committee, and
taree other members of the
committee. All expressed some dis-
satisfaction with the committee’s
success.

According to their statements, only
five meetings have been held during
the present year, at which a total of
25 persons were dealt with on vio-
lations of conventional dress. One
committee member stated that he
had personally filled out cards on
at least thirty students, some of
whom were apparently never
brought before the committee.

Another criticism made by com-
mittee members was that the com-
mittee suffers from a lack of set poli-
cy toward upperclassmen. One mem-
ber described as “apologetic” a meet-
ing at which an upperclassman was
interviewed for an infraction of con-

ventional dress rules.
W&L students who, three

years ago, carried the university to
the national debate championships.

Dave Marchese, captain of the de-| 2.

dent of the debate fraternity, Sigma

debate with great interest. A

“This award, in name, will honor
two students who have contributed
the most to the renaissance of de-
bate as well as to the promotion
of Washington and Lee,” said Gil-
liam.

Three solutions were suggested to
improve the committe’s performance:

Abolition of the committee.
Establishment of a definite
course of policy by the EC for
the committee to follow.

1966 Heart Fund Canvass
To Be Conducted Sunday
Under Auspices of IFC

Under the auspices of the IFC
the Heart Fund will conduct its 1966
canvass this Sunday at 1:30. The
chairman of the Heart Fund in this
area is Don Huffman.

The Heart Fund canvass will cov-
er the residential areas in Lexing-
ton and the small outlying towns.

As in the case last year, the IFC
requires that 6 people from each
fraternity participate in this func-
tion

 

Debate advisor, William W. Chaf-
fin, commented that “the award was
in the tradition of Dean Gilliam’s
continued interest in the university.”

Noell and Eckes, whom Chaffin
termed the “finest debate minds in
W&L history,” amassed a fantastic
win streak of 12 straight in their
push for the national champion-
ship.

Aside from debating, Noell found
time to be president of the student
body, as well as copping a Fulbright
scholarship, Phi Beta Kappa and
Omicron Delta Kappa honors. Eckes
also won a Fulbright, Phi Beta
Kappa and ODK honors.

Noell, who speaks at

Peace Corps
Discussed By
Ex-Members

Last night in duPont Hall Miss
Gloria Clark and Mr. Meredith Mac-
Kusick spoke about their experiences
as members of the Peace Corps.
Miss Clark, a native of Martinsville,
Virginia, and a graduate of Carson-
Newman, served for two years in
Colombia, South America. Here it
was her duty to educate the people
to better health habits. Mr. Mac-
Kusick, a graduate of Antioch, was
stationed in Liberia for two years
and taught economies and worked in
business administration.

In answering questions after their
talks, Miss Clark and Mr. Mac-
Kusick both agreed that the greatest
asset of the Peace Corps, besides the
giving of oneself for a worthy cause,
is the great responsibility of a work-
er has. A Peace Corps worker must
make important decisions on his own.
They also emphasized that the larg-
est percentage of workers are liber-
al arts graduates without technical
experience. However, everyone is put
through a comprehensive training
program lasting from 8 to 14 weeks.
In this period all the necessary skills
and languages are taught to the vol-
unteers.

To enter the Peace Corps, the
prospective candidate should take
the Peace Corps exam about nine
months before he wants to get in.
Once the test is administered, it is
sent to Washington and processed
within two months. If the candidate
qualifies, he is invited to train for
a specific job chosen for him by
virtue of his skills and preferences

More detailed information on the
Corps may be obtained from Dr.

Griffin Discusess CONTACT

(Continued from page 1)
the IFC at its next meeting, do you foresee any further at-
tempts to limit spending on rush booklets?

A: This I don’t know. It seems to me that spending for
rush week in general is far too high. Fraternities could save
themselves a lot of money if they would just agree to do so.
$1500-$2000 is quite a bit to pay for a new crop of pledges—
it works out to about $100 per pledge. I dare say that every
fraternity man would be very happy to have $100 given to him
tomorrow or at least $50.

If the motion fails to pass, I would certainly hope that the
fraternities would continue to seek out new ways to save costs
on rush week. My motive is not primarily to stop individual
rush booklets, rather, it is to reduce some of the mammoth
expenditures on rush week.

Q: Mr. Richard Fletcher, a Sigma Nu national officer, has
been invited to speak at the IFC-faculty next Tuesday night.
What is the purpose of this?

A: Mr. Fletcher is a very able man, with a lot of insight.
He states our particular problems in a way that is extremely
accurate and concrete. I think that his message will help the
fraternity leaders a great deal.

Q: Does his invitation to speak indicate that the IFC is
going to begin a campaign to solve some of its basic problems?

A: I would hope that the IFC is always trying to solve its
basic problems. In this respect, my answer is no. However, a
formal study of ourselves would have a great deal of merit,
and I would like to see Mr. Fletcher motivate the fraternity
presidents into such action.

Q: Do you think that Contact went over as well as ex-
pected?

A: A program of this type takes time to establish itself and
achieve a fair degree of success. I think that for its second
year, Contact went over very well. The student participation,
although it was reported to have been 61 per cent, is still low.
It seems that attendance by 85 per cent of the student body
would not be unrealistic at all. I think that the Co-Chairmen
did an excellent job after they got started—atlhough they did
get started rather late.

Q: Do you think Contact should be continued, and if so,
should the IFC continue to sponsor it?

A: It is not a question of whether or not to support or
continue it. The IFC passed an amendment to its constitution
last Spring which includes four points: 1) The IFC shall spon-
sor a Contact symposium every year except those of Mock
Convention (this is nota direct quote—only parahrased) .2)
The Chairman or Chairmen shall be selected by the Judicial
Board of the 163 along with the advice of the previous chair-
man. 3) “The IFC will assume responsibility for any debt incur-
redby Contact, after all other means of revenue have been ex-
hausted.”” 4) The IFC shall have a representative on the steer-
ing committee. Thus, Contact will be continued indefinitely.

Q: It is generally understood that Contact ran into a large

deficit this year. How great is this deficit and should there be
any problem covering it?
A: The deficit should be somewhere in the neighborhood
of $1500.00. There should be no problem collecting this
money from the houses on a pro-rated basis. For those that
will accuse the IFC of not having exhausted all means of reven-
ue, I must argue the point.

Our greatest appeal was to the parents of fraternity men.
I expect that most of these men did not specifically mention
the appeal to their parents. Thus, it will be hard to convince me
that we have not done all we can—primarily because each
fraternity man had (and still has, by the way) an opportunity
to solicit contributions from his parents.

Incidently, assuming there are close to 800 fraternity men,
a contribution of $5 per set of parents would bring $4000.00
of revenue—enough to run this year’s and next year’s sum-
posiums. As it was, we received contributions totaling approx:
imately $1,000—at an average of $50 a contribution. This
means that so far, 20 people have supported Contact financi-
ally. As a result of this poor response from the parents, I have
no qualms about assessing the houses.

Viet Symposium Urged

 

 

 

 

 

By NORMAN GLASSMAN
WEL Law Student

Since with each transpiring day
the world finds that by significant
inerements it is closer to destruc-
tion, a “Vietnam Symposium” is
hereby proposed. The Symposium
would center around the historical
background, the Communist “threat,”
and the various moral and legal eon-
siderations involved.

Due to the complexity of the issues
and to the alarming position we
find ourselves in, one is chagrined to
note how the student body and fac-
ulty ean sign petitions egging on
the President, without being aware
of how the war commenced. Is the
silence of the faculty to be inter-
pretated as a lack of courage, or is
it perhaps the “don't rock the boat”
attitude which permeates the Uni-
versity? One must wonder how this
effect” is condoned when
holocaust is an imminent

istrich

nuclear

 

possibility. If the state of affairs
I've outlined is in fact mythical, if
the faculty is in fact courageous,
then one must inferentially conclude
from their prolonged silence that
their knowledge of Vietnamese poli-
ties and history is in fact nonexistent

It is most appropriate that this
dialogue be set up within the Uni-
versity framework, for it is the uni-
versity community which can best
support the free (and analytical)
exchange of ideas. In fact, it ls ob-
ligatory for the administration and
faculty to forment such a student-
to-teacher, student-to-student ex-
change. For the University to ignore
this duty, is to derogate from its
most noble role.

It would be most unfortunate if
we allowed the spirit of CONTACT
to die. It would be disastrous for us
to allow the passage of one year's
time and only then allow it to raise
its head in an orgy of intellectualiam

 

Federal Administration, Economic Pressure
Hinder Public School Integration In South

By LIN HARTIN

On May 17, 1954, almost eleven
years ago, the Supreme Court of
the United States handed down a
unanimous decision in the case of
Brown vy. Topeka Board of Educa-
ton which declared that school seg-
regation on the basis of race was
unconstitutional. For the first few
years after the su-
preme court de-
cision, school inte-
gration was the
main theme of
the civil rights
movement. School
integration was
the cause of the
first major racial
incident in Little
Rock in 1957. It
was to this move-
ment that many
responsible Negro and white citizens
dedicated their efforts.

In the past year or so, however,
the problem of school integration,
though still of major significance,
has been pushed into the background
by seemingly more serious civil rights
problems. It has been generally
thought that the inevitable had at
last been accepted and the nation
could turn to more pressing civil
rights problems.

This was especially the case after
the passage of the Civil Rights Act of
1964. This act gave the administra-
tion a powerful weapon to use in
enforcing compliance with the 1954
court decision in that it provided that
federal aid of all kinds would be
cut off from individual school sys-
tems that did not comply with the
court decision. This was a most im-
portant step in that it relieved the
judiciary of the responsibility of en-
forcing the Supreme Court decision,
a responsibility which the courts
have borne alone since 1954. As Mr.
Justice Black stated in a fifth cir-
cuit decision last July, “By the 1964
Act, and the action of the Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare, administration of the law is
largely where it ought to be—in the
hands of the executive and its agen-
cies with the function of the judi-
ciary confined to those rare cases
presenting justifiable, not operation-
al questions.” The process of bring-
ing individual suits in the courts to
end segregation was painfully slow,
but the 1964 Act provided a much
faster and more efficient method.

In a Special Report published last
fall, the Southern Regional Council,
a highly respected, private civil
rights research agency based in At-
lanta, considered how the new law
was being carried out and come to
some rather gloomy conclusions. The
Administration depends on the US.
Office of Education for the informa-
tion that it needs on desegregation
to enforce the 1964 Act. The first
problem lies here, for the S.R.C.
found that up to this point the Of-
fice of Education has not been suffi-
ciently staffed to carry out its tre-
mendous new duties.

The present staff is dedicated
enough, but too overworked to do

the job as efficiently as it should be
done. The blame for this lies clearly
with the administration and Congress
and certainly steps should be taken
at once to correct this problem.
Because the Office of Education is
understaffed it is extremely limited
in its investigation of desegregation
in the South. Generally, the office
has had to be satisfied with individ-
ual statements from school systems.
While some systems probably were
honest and above board with the
Office, on the whole it is too much
to expect that the majority of the
school systems would volunteer ac-
curate information if they could
avoid doing it. Indeed, when the

 

S.R.C. conducted its investigation of |
desegregation, it found the Office of
Education figures to be considerable
in error.

In their effort, the research de-
partment received help from the US.
Office of Education, the Southern
Education Reporting Service, state
Councils on Human Relations and
other organizations. They also used
newspaper reports of their own field
investigators. In Alabama, for ex-
ample, they found that only 717
Negroes attended integrated schools
while the Office of Education's figures
indicated that 15,300 Negroes at-
tended integrated schools. In North
Carolina the Office of Education
figure was three times larger than
that of the Southern Regional Coun-

 

 

cil.

On the whole, the S.R.C. Gover |
ered that the Office of Education had
overestimated the number of Ne-
groes in integrated schools by some
60 thousand and that today only 5.2
per cent of the South’s Negro chil-
dren attend integrated schools. “The
truth is,” the report states, “that
nearly ninety-five per cent of the
South’s Negro pupils are still trapped
in segregated and unequal schools.
The false impression is due largely
to attempts by the state and local
federal authorities and perhaps some
feleral officials to imply that school
systems were desegregated beyond
mere tokenism.

In carrying its investigation furth-

“mere tokenism”

er, the S.R.C. discovered that much
of the so called desegregation that
has taken place has been under the
guise of “freedom of choice.” This
policy gives students living in a
particular school district the right
to request a transfer to any school
in that district and sometimes to
schools in neighboring districts.
Negro children could supposedly
transfer to all white schools if they
wished.

First, this policy is a clear viola-
tion of the guideline set down by
the Office of Education which which
states, “The responsibility to elimi-
nate segregation rests with the
school authorities and is not satis-
fied by rules and practices which
shift the burden of removing dis-

Per Cent of Negroes

of persons previously discriminated
against.”

Secondly, the S.R.C. discovered
that in districts where “freedom of
choice” is the policy, both economic
and physical pressure is put upon
the Negroes who try to have their
children transferred to white schools.
A rather extreme example of this
is the case of Crawfordville, Georgia
which made the headlines for several
days last fall. White children were
all transferred out of Taliaferro
County schools to all-white schools
in neighboring counties. This policy
soon bankrupted the school system.
When Negroes protested one Negro
principal, five Negro teachers, two

       

Negro bus drivers, two Negro cooks,
two Negro custodians in addition to
twenty-two Negro parents of chil-
dren were fired from their jobs.
Also, six Negro families were evicted
and four faced sudden foreclosures.

What can and must be done to
solve this serious problem? First, as
I suggested earlier the Office of
Education must be given a larger
staff and more funds, the means to
carrying out its new duties. Second,
the Office of Education must stop ac-
cepting “freedom of choice” inter-
gration without careful investiga-
tion. Last, as the St. Petersburg
Times put it on October 16, 1965,
“The next step in the civil rights
struggle is to deny to those who still
shout ‘Never!’ the economic weap-
ons long used against Negroes and

 

crimination to the class or classes

tested anew at Crawfordville.”

 

Letters To The Editor

IFC Refutes Lee, Students Call For Vietnam Victory

IFC Answers Lee Column

On Wednesday, February 2, the
Interfraternity Council debated the
“Jewish list” question. At the end of
this discussion, the fraternity presi-
dents voted to discontinue the prac-
tice of distributing dual lists of in-
coming freshmen. In the past, it has
been possible to distinguish between
Jewish and non-Jewish students by
means of the dual lists.

On Tuesday, Febrary 8, Mr. Rob-
ert Lee presented a column in the
Ring-tum Phi on this action. The
following is a statement in response
to Mr. Lee's views, written at the
unanimous encouragement of the
LFC Judicial Board.

Lee's Criticiam

The motives of the IFC's “enlight-
ened leadership” are two-fold. First,
these people wish to do away with
unreasonable  diserimination in
whatever form it may take. Second-
ly, it is the desire of the Judicial
Board to further and protect the
interests of the fraternities, both im-
mediately within our own academic
community, and in our relationship
with the outside world, With re-
gard to the first motive, I must ad-
mit that the IFC has been in the
wrong—indeed, to an unjustified ex-
tent. We do not ask to be excused

for our past poor judgment and
sense of values; however, we do
ask for the opportunity to be able

to recognize these faults and correct
them without being laheled hypre-
crites

 

The Judical Board has not changed
its position with respect to the sec-
ond motive. We have attempted to
protect the interests of fraternities
in the past, and will continue to do
so in the future. These motives are
best illustrated by a history of the
“Jewish list”

Last spring, the IFC was attempt-
ing to support both of these motives,
We faced two problems: On the one
hand, if one list was issued, then
we would have been discriminating
against the “Jewish” fraternities, one
of which claimed it needed them
most and was one of the strongest
advocates of dual lists. Thus, the dis-
crimination problem reached a stale-
mate. This, we estimate, brought
in several votes in favor of dual
lists.

External Problem

On the other hand, we were faced
with an external problem. At the
time, there were several chapters
at other schools which were receiv-
ing criticisms for discriminatory
clauses from several groups, includ-
ing their respective administrations
‘eg. Stanford—Sigma Chi). Added
to this problem was pressure from
the national offices of fraternities to
atick by the restrictive clauses or
face the alternative of having their
charter taken away. Thus, the IFC
felt that it would not have been

 

in the best interests of either the
University or the houses so affected!
by such clauses, to invite the same

groups, national officers, and news

media. This problem also brought
several votes in favor of dual lists
Together, enough votes were cast to
continue the use of dual lists.

However, times DO change. Little
by little, each of these problems was
overcome, The “enlightened leaders”
of the IFC investigated the problems
of the national attacks on local chap-
ters, with specific attention given the
Stanford-Sigma Chi case. Leaders of
the national officers of Sigma Chi
were contacted personally at the Na-
tional Interfraternity Conference
shortly before Christmas, and we
learned that the problem is virtually
solved——at least to the extent that
it would hurt a chapter on our cam-
pus. It was discovered that all a
chapter has to do is challenge its
national offices, and the fraternity
leaders became quiet, rather quick-
ly

With regard to our internal prob-
lem, the Judicial Board discussed the
lista with the two “Jewish” houses
before the motion to do away with
dual lists was presented to the IFC
Finally, about a month ago, the
Judicial Board received a directive
from the Student Affairs Commit-
tee that the IFC look at the problem
of dual lists, and make a recommen-
dation to the committee as to what
action should be taken, if any

accusations have some validity. How-

that many forces are at play in an

We of the Judical Board know

Team To Play E&H
In Last Home Game

By RON KESSLER |
Washington and Lee’s struggling |
but improving basketball team lost a
tough one Wednesday night to
Hampden-Sydney College, 78-66.
Sparked by the fine play of Jody
Kline, the Generals contained Hamp-
den-Sydney throughout most of the
game; however, a couple of bad
passes and an effective Tiger half-
court press resulted in the loss,
According to coach Verne Canfield,
“We could have given them a closer
game. We expected that half-court
press, but their defense still accom-
pished what they wanted. Jody
Kline played the finest game we've }
seen since he’s been at W&L.” Kline
had 19 points, seven rebounds, and
seven team high for the
season.

assists—a

The game was unquestionably an
improvement over last year’s en-
counter with the same team, which
the Generals lost 117-77. High scorer
for the game was H-S’s Dyer with
21, followed by teammate Quarles
with 20. Also in double figures for
the Generals besides Kline were Rob
Bauer with 13 and Earl Edwards
with 10.

Tonight the Generals meet Emory
and Henry in the final home game
of the year, in Doremus Gym at
8:00. Despite a mediocre record, the
E&H squad is young and explosive;
they’ve had a tough schedule and
have played several close games.

Canfield says of the visitors that

 

“if they get hot they can explode.

The E&H game will also mark
the final appearance in Doremus of
team captain Bob Spessard and fel-
low senior Steve Sweitzer. Both have
been members of the varsity squad
for their entire four years at W&L.

Bauer Leads Team
After 20 games (not including the

Hampden-Sydney contest), fresh-
man Rob Bauer leads in scoring
with 306 points. Bauer is the first

W&L player to score over 300 points
in his freshman year since Dom
Flora in 1955. Flora went on to make
All-American as a senior.

Bauer leads in both field goals
and free throws with 109 and 88 re-®
sepctively, followed by junior Frank
Morrison, who has 84 field goals and
61 charity tosses for a total of 229
points. Morrison also leads the team
in shooting percentage with 49 per
cent while Earl Edwards follows with
45.3 per cent.

Jody Kline tops the list in free
throw percentage, hitting 42 of 59
for a 71.2 average. Bauer is second
with 70.4 per cent. Spessard leads
in rebounds with a total of 192 for
an average of 9.6 per game; Bauer
is runner-up with 146 and 7.7,

Matmen Face

Old Dominion;
10th Event Set

Last year a wrestling match had
eight individual matches. This year
it’s nine. But tomorrow night it will
be ten, as the Washington and Lee
varsity wrestling team takes on Old
Dominion College.

Coach Dick Miller has agreed
with the Monarch’s coach to wrestle
ten men, adding a 191 pound class
in order to wrestle at all posisble
weights, spanning the big gap be-
tween 177 and heavyweight.

Miller, in predicting a “real tough”
match, added that Old Dominion is
exceptionally strong from 130 to 160.
Hogue, Ragland, Cleveland, Harris,
and Cote thus far this year have
compiled an excellent record.

W&L, which has only one winne
back from last year’s 17-11 loss, is
probably going to swich the usual
starting line-up around.

Either Rolly Jacobs or Jim Bru-
ton will go at 123, with the other
getting the nod at 130. Kem White,
co-captain, will wrestle at 137, while
Don Paterson goes at 145.

Charlie Slaughter is the 152 choice
and will be followed by either co-
captain Jamie Andrew or Bob Mun-
son at 160, the other following at
167.

Jay Clarke is the starter at 177,
and Warren Stewart and Holmes
Raker will fill 191 and heavyweight,
though which one will go first is still
undecided.

The Generals, holding a 4-3 season
record, must win either against Old
Dominion or U.Va. next Saturday in
order to finish above .500 for the
year.

Swimmers Go To D.C.

Coach Norris Eastman’s varsity
swim team (this may or not be an
“in” joke) left this afternoon for
a weekend trip to Washington, D.C

The tankmen will face American
University tonight at 8. The Eagles,
who traditionally have a strong team,
defeated East Carolina earlier this
season, while W&L lost to the Pir-

ates last week.

Tomorrow the Generals face
Georgetown at 2 p.m. Coach East-

man, who is taking a large, injury-
free squad, anticipates strong com-
petition in both meets.

Against ‘No Girls In Dorm’ Law

(Continued from Page 1)

sibility of revoking or modifying the
rules against girls in the dormitories.
In a statement issued to the Ring-
tum Phi, they stated:

“ ..We have taken a survey of
social controls at comparable insti-
tutions throughout the country. The
results of this survey, which brought
us information on sixteen schools,
showed that all private, nondenomi-
national schools surveyed except two
(Bowdoin and Columbia) allow girls
in men’s dormitories during speci-
fied hours of the week. Schools in
this category include Amherst, Trin-
ity, Williams, and Wesleyan as well
as most of the Ivy League schools... .
Our situation, while similar to that
of these other schools, is indeed
unique, and our solution to the prob-
lem must deal with our political con-
ditions.

“It is the sad truth that the city
(2!) of Lexington on a Saturday
night has little better to offer than
Doc’s and the Pit. Thus, with the
exception of fraternities and apart-
ments, there are extremely slim op-
portunities for social entertainment
in the W&L environment. This void
puts a heavy handicap on the social
life of the non-fraternity men. ...The
present universitiy policy of not al-
lowing girls in the dormitories ef-
fectively excludes independent dor-
mitory residents from a full social

life, which is generally considered
a significant part of the total college
experience.

“We believe that the nature of
the W&L student body warrants
a change in the administration poli-
cy; the W&L student is as intelli-
gent and responsible as the students
at other similar institutions which
grant this privilege....

“The major argument advanced...
is that all dormitory rooms are bed-
rooms, and permission to take girls
into the dormitories would be in ef-
fect university sanction of sex. The
fact is that not every student in
taking a girl to his room has the in-
tention of sexual relations, even
though we admit that such actions
are likely to occur. Nevertheless, is
is not the university’s responsibility
to oversee such personal aspects of
a student’s life....

“Other arguments advanced by the
administration are the invasion of
privacy of other dormitory residents,
the lack of bathroom facilities for
women, and the difficulty in ad-
ministering the restrictions necessary
for the implementation of such a
policy. Although these arguments
have some superficial merit, the
problems they present may be sur-
mounted with little difficulty. In
summary, we believe that this change
is possible, desirable, and necessary,
although we realize that it will be
difficulty to achieve. We therefore,
call on dormitory residents and the
student body in general to actively
support our proposals when it comes
up for consideration.”

Conventional Dress Dying

To the Editor:

There is a considerable difference
between a law which is unenforce-
able, and one which is unenforced.
The current leadership of the Wash-
ington and Lee Assimilation Com-
mittee, from all external appear-
ances, has seen its job in the former
light: enforcing that which is unen-
forceable. Because of this defeatist

attitude, the conventional dress
rules have not been enforced.
The Committee has let it be

known that no student will be as-
similated in the town, or after dark.

Insistence on adherence has retreat-
ed to a feeble request that students
maintain the tradition “at least on
the Hill.” Militancy has departed
the Committee, and with it, what-
ever little efficiency it ever had.

infrequently, establish-
ing vague Committee rules about
assimilating (or not assimilating)
upper-classmen, and in general let-
ting almost every important aspect
of conventional dress disintegrate,
the Assimilation Committee has done
more damage in six months than
warm weather ever did.

The EC. should either abolish the
Committee or more strictly super-
vise it. If conventional dress is to
survive, the latter course must be
taken immediately.

Griffin Interviewed On IFC

(Continued from page 2)

Q: Could you describe briefly the offer from the two CPA
firms in town, made to the IFC?

A: These two firms have presented a proposal to the IFC
that would, in effect, bring about a standardized bookkeeping
system for the fraternities, and would include audits anually
and monthly, on a less thorough basis. Each fraternity would
retain a firm and use this firm for regular consultation.

Q: Do you favor this proposal?

A: Very emphatically. I believe that we would be shocked

if we put all the various systems together and took notice of
some of the very poor accounting methods in use. Given this
program, W&L fraterinties would have one of the soundest
fraternity financial programs in the nation. Many other schools
already have gone under such a program.
Q: When do you expect this program will be initiated?
A: The IFC must give its approval first, of course. The
proposal will be brought to a vote, a constitutional amend-
ment, only after the fraternity presidents and treasurers duly
understand the program and its advantages. This will be
brought about by sessions with representatives of the CPA
firms, fraternity advisors, Dean Atwood, etc.

 

    

FASHIONS

By CHIP TOLBERT
ESQUIRE’S FASHION EDITOR

THE MODS OF LONDON have been responsible for nurturing

some of the most radical and exciting fashion ideas in recent
memory. At the outset, however, let’s make it clear that virtually
none of these fashions are presently being worn on American
campuses. Yet in fashion as in everything else, from extremes
emerge the means, and there’s no doubt that modified versions of
many of these innovations will catch on and be counted among the
best college market sellers in the near future. In any case, we
thought you'd be interested in hearing about what's happening
right now on the London fashion scene, as well as what's being
done in Mod fashions in America.

“SEE YOU IN CARNABY” is the in-phrase among London’s way-

out swingers these days. Almost overnight, Carnaby Street, located
in London's fashionable West End, has become the center and the
source of what the Mods refer to as their “instant fashions.” It’s
an amusing paradox that Carnaby is located a mere 200 yards from
Savile Row, long recognized as headquarters for London’s most
distinguished and conservative tailoring establishments. Who
shops Carnaby? Only the Dave Clark Five, The Rolling Stones, The
Animals, four young men named John, George, Paul and Ringo,
and a fifth who used to be known around town as Anthony Arm-
strong-Jones, And what do they, and thousands of their fans and
followers, buy there? Some pretty surprising fashions...

THE MOD TUXEDO, for a start, offers plenty

of surprises, Cut tight and skinny, it features
a 3 or 4-button jacket, high, narrow lapels, very
deep side vents, satin belt loops, cuffs, and a
wide satin belt. The trousers are tapered in
extremis, and the outfit may be worn with black
demi-boots. Accessories are radical, if not out
rageous: frills on the cuffs and front of the
shirt, plus a very wide bow tie.

THE MOD MODE, in all apparel areas, is char-

acterized by certain definite trends, The ward-
robe is form-fitted, and anything smacking of
standardized fashions is “automatically out.”
The plumage on the male bird is getting
brighter and snappier, and there’s no doubt that
it’s getting harder all the time to tell the boys
apart from the girls. Prices are comparatively
high: slacks run anywhere from $15. to $25.
Lines are fluid, and we frequently find strong surface interest in a
rich variety of textured fabrics, In slacks, the low-rise, hip-hugging
mode! is in. Belts run as wide as three inches, and many of them
are colorfully striped,

MODISM MOVES ON: here are some more “musts” in the fashion-

conscious Mod's wardrobe, A camel suede overshirt with seamed
pockets and shoulders, usually worn with slacks tapered to the knee,
then flared out to bell bottom cuffs. A pair of giant black-and-white
houndstooth check trousers, worn as low as possible. Ticking-
striped low-rise jeans worn with a matching snap-front jacket,
A rugged blue denim shirt with a high-rise collar and cuffs of white
broadcloth, A fancy soft leather vest. The Mod Suit which doubles
as a sports ensemble merely by unbuttoning the suit collar and re-
placing it with a dark collar, And maybe even a black vinyl, double-
breasted jacket with slanting side pockets and patch breast pocket,

SHIRTING THE MOD usually involves wild
