University
hires ombuds

Adrninstration welcomes
a new addition to provide »

consultation and mediation

By Eleanor Kennedy
STAFF WRITER

» Washington & Lee just added another mem-
ber to its administration, Jane Ellen Reid, the new
University Ombuds. According the University web
site, Reid’s duties will be to mediate work-related
conﬂicts, issues and other on-campus concerns. A
seven-person team of faculty and staff appointed by
President Ruscio recommended the creation of the
position after discussions with faculty at W&L and’
at other universities. jl '

The web site lists the duties of the ombuds as
“providing impartial, Cxnﬁdential consultation to
all employees, helping .-iIployees and supervisors
resolve conﬂicts, teaching skills for dispute resolu-
tion, providing mediation, and helping employees
understand and interpret policies and procedures.”

“As an ombuds, I relish the oppor-
tunity to work with parties, to help
them discover their own capacity
to address diﬁicult conversations

and to resolve conﬂict. ”
JANE ELLEN REID, University ombuds

W&L is “fortunate to have someone with Jane
Ellen Reid’s expertise to provide this new resource
for W&L faculty and staff,” Ruscio said recently.
“Her background in informal conﬂict resolution is
a perfect ﬁt and will serve our campus community
well.”

Reid received a B.A. in history from the Univer-
sity of Vermont and an M.E. from Northern Arizona
University. Her professional experience began at
the Western Pinal County Literacy Program in Casa
Grande, Arizona, where she worked for four years.

Reid served as the director of the Academic Sup-
port Center at Central Arizona College from 1992 to
2006. During this time, she also took on the roles of
chair of the college advisoryicouncil, faculty devel-
opment coordinator, and both developer and direc-
tor of the college ombudsman program.

Reid moved to Virginia in 2006, and started co-
teaching in the Center for Justice and Peace Build-
ing Master’s Program at Eastern Mennonite Univer-
sity in Harrisonburg.,The following year she began
working as director of University Accord, EMU’s
mediation, facilitation and job-coaching program
for faculty, staff and students.

Reid also works‘ at Bridgewater College as a
teacher of conﬂict transformation. She is also cur-
rently working on her Ph.D. in conﬂict analysis and
resolution at NOVA Southeastern University. 0

Reid says that her interest in conflict resolution
initially stemmed from “growing conﬂict at one
place of employment.”

Reid goes on to explain that in response to this
conﬂict, she and several of her peers came together.

“[We] collaborated to create an oversight group
and a declaration of civility, and to outline positive
and professional behaviors expected of all employ-
ees,” she said. “This experience was the beginning
of my commitment to the usefulness of conﬂict in-
tervention.”

Reid’s hopes are high for her new role at W&L

“I hope that my fundamental belief, that each
of us has the ability to name and communicate our
needs to others, is evident in my practice,” Reid
said. “As an ombuds, I relish the opportunity to
work with parties, to help them discover their own
capacity to address difficult conversations and to
resolve conﬂict. Coaching individuals in the art of
productive communication is one of the most satis-
fying aspects of my practice.”

The gender experiment

W&L breaks convention as both boys and girls live side—by-side on Davis second ﬂoor

By Lizz Dye
smrr WRlTER

Washington & Lee has recently
initiated a big push towards improv-
ing gendenrelations with a new ex-
periment: a co—ed residence hall in a
section of Davis Hall.

Are co-ed resident halls the an-
swer to improving gender relations?
Can men and women co-exist on a
daily basis and still maintain a sense
of inter-gender comradery and close-
ness?

Morgan Harris, graduate of the
class of 2009, believes this is pos-

sible. He came up with the initial

idea for co-ed halls his junior year
because he felt the residence halls
barred healthy, natural relations be-
tween men and women.

On this endeavor, Harris worked
alongside Katt Corr, also a gradu-
ate of the class of 2009. According
to Harris, Corr lived right above him
in Davis throughout their ﬁrst year
at W&L, but the two did not end up
meeting until the spring term of their
sophomore year.

“Now Kate is one of my best
friends,” Harris said. “Looking back,
had we lived on the same hall or
had the chance to live closer to one
another, we could’ve have become
friehds earlier in our lives.”

When men and women are living
together with their respective genders
on a hall, Harris says, they begin to
adapt the gender stereotypes associ-
ated with the sexes, which obviously
leads to problems.

He approached President Ruscio
and Dean Watkins with the idea, and
they in turn presented the idea to the
Board of Trustees. Last fall, during
Harris’s senior year, things began to
come together.

Davis residence hall is home to the first-year experimental
co-ed halls. Twelve men and thirteen women inhabit the
newest addition to W&L’s push to improve gender relations.
The brainchild of recently graduated Morgan Harris, the co-
ed halls aim to promote healthy and natural relations be-
tween men and women.

The co-ed hall is set up so that
men and women have rooms next to
one another. There are 12 men and
13 women total, and a male and fe-
male RA on the ends of the hall.

Residents indicated whether
or not they would like to live on a
co-ed hall on their living residence
preference sheet. Hall meetings may
comprise the whole hall or be gen-
der-speciﬁc, depending on the topic.

Sophomores Kate Gibbs and Ste-
phen Wilson are the hall’s two Resi-
dent Advisors. l

When asked if male and female
residents’ behavior seemed different
than those who live in same-gender
hall, Gibbs said that “we are still
building a sense of community, but
we seem like a very typical hall.”

Gibbs also said it is “too early to

- tell” whether or not gender relations

will be improved by men and wom-
en living together, but that “if we all
feel a certain responsibility for the
other members of the hall regardless
of their gender, we can all help im-
prove gender relations. ‘

First-year Katelyn Daugherty is
one of the 13 female residents on the
hall. She said she living in a co-ed
hall because she feels like she has
“a built-in family with brothers and
sisters.”

Daugherty also says it makes it
easier to meet a lot of different male
friends quickly because the boys
who already live on the hall will in-
troduce their other friends.

Taking precautions against swine ﬂu

School oﬁicials raise awareness about HINI, stressing self-treatment and prevention

Bynuoenie Wong
STAFF WRITER

With thousands of college stu-
dents returning to campus this week
and no vaccine available until mid-
October, Washington & Lee Univer-
sity ofﬁcials are emphasizing that
students protect themselves against
the HINI virus by regularly washing
their hands, befriending a ﬂu buddy
and practicing good hygiene.

“I would encourage people to
think about universal precautions.
Every contact you’ve had with an-
other person, or the environment that
other people have been in, is a po-
tential source of infection,” said Dr.

we were all, internationally, dealing
with an unknown element. We now
all know what we’re dealing with.”

Watkins, who heads the universi-
ty’s Emergency Management Team,
said that the timing of spring term
could have contributed to the last
outbreak. Students, returning from
their spring break, may have brought
back the virus from other states. '

A Respiratory Illness Survey dis-
tributed to the campus community
last spring also revealed that many
students were sharing their drinking
cups with each other.

“I think we are prepared as any university could be.

It was different in the spring because we were all,

internationally, dealing with an unknown element.

We now all know what we ’re dealing with. ”

DAWN WATKINS, VP of student affairs and dean of students

Jane Horton, the university’s director
of health services.

This is the latest effort against the
rapidly spreading HINI virus, also
called the swine ﬂu, in a college that
already had an outbreak last spring.

At least 14 students were infected
with the virus during spring term,
making W&L the ﬁrst college to
experience a swine ﬂu, outbreak in
Virginia.

“I think we are prepared as any
university could be,” said Dawn
Watkins, the vice president for stu-
dent affairs and dean of students. “It

was different in the spring because -

But the virus isn’t just spread-
ing throughout W&L. The Ameri-
can College Health Associationisays
nearly three-quarters of the country’s
higher learning institutions are now
reporting students with ﬂu-like
symptoms.

The association reported 4,045
new cases of suspected HINI inﬂu-
enza, at 149 of the 204 participat-
ing schools for the week of Aug. 29
through Sept. 4.

Unlike the seasonal ﬂu, the virus
has hit younger people and people
with an underlying health condition
harder than it has the elderly.

To protect themselves from get-
ting infected with the virus, the uni-
versity is encouraging students to
take precautions such as_ using their
own food utensils, properly covering
up a cough or sneeze and staying at
least 6 feet away from a person in-
fected with the ﬂu. 4

Advertisements throughout the
campus and a web site about the
swine ﬂu are also part of the univer-
sity’s efforts to raise awareness and
prevention.

With only 10 beds available in the
health center, and one nurse and one
physician on" call, the university is
placing more emphasis on self-treat-
ment and prevention.

“We would be completely over-
whelmed if we ended up with a big
outbreak and everyone felt like they
needed to be seen [by a doctor],”
said Dr. Horton.

Last spring, when information
about the virus remained relatively
unknown, the Virginia Department
of Health was testing students for
the HINI virus. Those with the vi-
rus were kept isolated in the student
health center.

This fall, students who experi-
ence ﬂu-like symptoms most likely
have the HINI virus, because the
seasonal ﬂu season doesn’t begin un-
til later in the year, said Dr. Horton.
The good news, she said, is that the
new strain of ﬂu doesn’t appear any
more severe than the seasonal ﬂu.

Students with a fever less than
100 degrees Fahrenheit probably
do not need to see a doctor unless
they’re V experiencing -more seri-
ous symptoms such as shortness of

breath and chest pains.

Those with the ﬂu are recom-
mended to self-isolate themselves at
home until theirfever is gone for 24
hours without fever-reducing medi-
cine.

They should also have a ﬂu buddy
to bring them food and their school
assignments so they reduce the pos-
sibility of infecting other students
and staff members on campus.

While the Virginia Department
of Health is no longer testing for
the HINI virus, it recommends that
everyone get both the seasonal and
swine ﬂu vaccines once they become
available.

“We’re expecting that this vaccine
will be pretty effective, but we never
know until after the fact exactly how
effective,” said Dr. Mark Levine, the
department’s deputy commissioner
for emergency preparedness and re-
sponse programs.

Levine said that the department
expects everyone in Virginia who
wants to get vaccinated against the
HINI virus to be able to once the
vaccine is distributed.

olonnade under construction
Newcomb shows‘ signs of renovation, new grant oﬂers more funds for updating the hall is interior and classrooms ‘V

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

A recent grant will go toward
the continued renovation of
Washington and Lee’s cherished
Colonnade. ‘

The university began its Col-
onnade renovation after gradua-
tion last year, staring with New-
comb Hall, in efforts to provide
a better learning environment for
the most used building on cam-

move into the 28 faculty offices
located inside Newcomb. The
remodeled space will also have
two classrooms and three semi-
nar rooms, which hold 12 to 15
students each. The classrooms
will have ﬁat screen monitors as
part of an audio-visual package.
While the exterior of New-
comb Hall will remain the. same,

We are all anticipating having an environ-

ment which will allow for the most modern

classroom technologies and for opportunities

to meet informally with eachother and with

our students in our new lounges.

pus.

Enabling work on Newcomb
Hall began in April. Newcomb,
the home of the history and soci-
ology and anthropology depart-
ments as well as the teacher-edu-
cation program, is the ﬁrst of the
ﬁve buildings on the Colonnade
to undergo renovation. Construc-
tion is expected to last for 14
months, ending in July 2010 and
totaling $10 million.

These improvements include
maintenance endowment, tech-
nology and furnishings. Con-
struction and renovation of the
rest of the Colonnade is expected
to continue for ﬁve years. .

Following the completion
of Newcomb Hall, faculty will

the interior will undergo “reha-
bilitation”, according to Thomas
Kalasky, director of design and
construction.

The renovation includes cre-
ating' student lounges and bring-
ing the buildings up to code. This
means that an elevator will be

built in Newcomb, while the his-'

torical architectural features of

the building will be preserved.
David Novack, head of the

department of sociology and

anthropolgy, said, “We are all_

anticipating having an environ-
ment which will allow for the
most modern classroom tech-
nologies and for opportunities to
meet informally with each other
and with our students in our new

lounges.”

Novack is also looking for-
ward to rejoining his colleagues
on campus after working from
his ofﬁce in the former. Baker
Residence Hall.

David Peterson, acting head
of the history department also
looks forward to returning to
campus. Peterson believes that
the improvements will comple-
ment the History Department.

“The history department has
always prided itself on the qual-
ity of its teaching. Having all
new, state-of-the-art classrooms
will clearly be an incentive to
"continue our commitment to
pedagogical innovation and the
development of our classroom
presentation skills,” said Peter-
son.

Newcomb Hall enhance-
ments include infrastructure
upgrades, such as wiring and
air conditioning. However, the
characteristic features of New-
comb such as. its ﬁreplaces
and chalkboards will be main-
tained.

In addition to aesthetic
changes, Newcomb is also being
renovated to meet Leadership in
Energy and Environmental De-
sign (LEED) qualiﬁcations.

The teacher-education pro-
gram was never located in
Newcomb Hall before, and
Lenna Ojure, directorof teacher
education, said she is excited
about the move. “This will be a
new experience for us. We are
looking forward to being in a

Workers scale the exterior of Newcomb hall, updating the structure of the build-
ing. Work began in the spring and is scheduled to be completed by July 2010.
Newcomb is the first of the five buildings on the Colonnade to be rennovated, ‘C

Co-ed hall

continued from page 1

Although she has enjoyed co-ed liv-
ing so far, she also says there is a disad-
vantage to seeing the boys all the time
because she feels like they revert into
the “typical guy” and perhaps say and do
things they normally do when they are
not around girls.

Male resident ﬁrst—year Nick Cianci-
olo feels entirely differently about living
with women. He believes that co-ed liv-

ing has a shot at improving gender rela-
tions; however, if he could choose to do
it all over again, he would deﬁnitely live
in an all-male hall.

Cianciolo feels that his fellow male
residents are missing out on the male
comradery that develops between same-
gender halls and that the residents are not
“banding together” as they would if they
did not live with girls.

ﬁc and more colleagues.”

The Lettie Pate Evans grant
provided $1 million toward the
Newcomb Hall renovation. This
grant is in addition to contribu-
tions from alumni and trustees.
Initial plans «for the renewal of
Newcomb were brought on by
a grant from the Getty Founda-
tion.

While the funding for the
other buildings has not been
provided yet, creative ﬁnancing
through tax credits, which pro-
vides funding for a building that
qualiﬁes as a historical structure
and follows interior qualiﬁca-
tions, may be implemented for
work done on the following four
buildings.

The Lettie Pate Evans grant
program emphasizes private
secondary and higher educa-
tion programs, arts and culture,
museums and historic preserva-
tion in Georgia and Virginia and
provides grants for other public
charities.

Traditionally, the foundation
gives priority to 0ne—time capi-
tal projects and well-established
organizations with extraordinary
needs.

Fund-raising for the renova-
tion of the entire Colonnade is
still on-going. The project is esti-
mated to cost $50 million, taking
at least ﬁve years to complete.
Foundations continue to be an
important part of the beautiﬁca-

tion of the Colonnade.

Phase two of the Colonnade
renovation, which includes the
remodeling of Payne, Washing-
ton and Robinson Halls are in the
design phase.

He also thinks that if he were not on
the football team, it would be more dif-
ﬁcult to make friends because there is a
smaller margin of men that he can see
and talk to on a daily basis.

Harris said that “the infrastructure
of W&L is still ﬁmdamentally ﬂawed
on many levels, but this co-ed hall is a
clear step in the right direction and it
will hopeﬁilly inspire future leaders at

W&L to make it a better place to live and
learn.”

Harris ultimately stressed that he is
not being negative in his criticism, but
hopes that mixed halls will spark activ-
ism to change more things the students
can and should be responsible for. in
shaping their college experience.

According to Harris, it is the job of
W&L students to change and shape the

four-year experience. New co-ed hous-
ing could be built to accommodate up-
perclassmen to further the gender inte-
gration, he said.

Giving Libertarians at W&L the lesson they need

Although it may be cool to be a Libertarian, true Republicans need to identify with their own party

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

It’s September and college
life has ﬁnally returned. While
some of us are new and most
are getting back in the swing of
things, we must all remember to
avoid some dangerous pitfalls
that harm most college students.

Sometimes it’s okay to fol-
low what everyone else is doing
during college. You probably
should be investing in Wendy’s
and Natty Light instead of the
much healthier but also more ex-
pensive alternatives. You prob-
ably should start going to classes
and doing homework, if only to
keep your parents at peace. And
most importantly, you probably
should follow that car full of
ﬁrst-year girls headed towards
Pole Three. In those cases, fol-
lowing the crowd can have posi-
tive consequences.

However, those are still ex-
ceptions to the rule. Following
the crowd can also be dangerous,
especially when it comes to poli-
tics. Ask most of the conservative
and independent Obama voters
how they feel about change and
hope right now, and they’ll prob-
ably register for a handgun to
point at you. That is why I want
you to be weary of following the
political trend at Washington &
Lee right now.

I am warning you to please
not become a Libertarian.

For the last couple of years,
Libertarians have become a rela-
tive phenomenon. In fact, they
have gotten so big that they have
entered our cultural stratosphere.

After Ron Paul made it on “The
Colbert Report” and “Bruno,”
being Libertarian officially be-
came cool. If you walk around
enough parties here, you will
hear at least one or two guys
trying to explain why Obama’s
health care plan is ﬁscally irre-
sponsible. These guys, who use
CSPAN to get themselves laid,
are guys you will see a lot more
of now that econ class and par-
ties happen the same day.

I have a problem with these
guys.

This problem did not start
with our generation. Fortunately,
we can blame our parents for
this one. When the Baby Boom-
ers hit college in the ‘60s, they
hated their parents and wanted to
see the world drastically change.
That’s when liberalism got big.
However, when the Baby Boom-
ers hit college, they also wanted
to get laid. That’s when liberal-
ism got annoying.

When you think of the 60s you
think of tie-dye, drugs and some
fun music. What you don’t think
of is that guy in “Animal House”
playing folk music on his guitar
to a bunch of girls... that is, un-
til John Belushi came down the
stairs and obliterated the guitar.
John Belushi was making a state-
ment in that scene: occasionally
it’s okay to be a Free Love Lib-
eral, but please don’t use it for
the wrong reasons.

Being the offspring of the
Baby Boomers, we still have that
same anger for what our parents

represent and the same energy
for changing in the world. Sadly,
we don’t have liberalism to turn
to because our parents already
stole that idea.

Instead, we went back the
other way... to the dark side. We
became Republicans.

George Bush didn’t make it
easy by making a couple of, uh,
questionable decisions in his pe-

relevant or dim-witted. In a lot of
cases, they actually have a point.
But with that overall philosophy,
anyone with a C in microeco-
nomics can make himself appear
intelligent to an unsuspecting
ﬁrst-year girl.

By now, most of the liberals
reading this piece are either nod-
ding their heads with a smile or
are furious because this media

Some students seem to mix up being a Libertarian

and being a Republican. If you are in love with lais-

sez faire economics and small government, you are a

Republican and NOT a Libertarian.

 

riod. Plus, being Republican was
so 1950. We wanted something
better, something cooler and
something that got us laid.

That’s where Libertarianism
comes into play.

Libertarianism is awesome
because basically you are saying
that the government should play
the same role in your life as The
Trident: something that is tech-
nically there, but doesn’t affect
your life whatsoever.

All the work is already done
for you because there’s nothing
that you really have to work for.
Basically, you are just a resident
at the Player Hater’s Ball.

Now, I don’t want to say that
what Libertarians are saying is ir-

outlet has not mentioned them
nearly enough, and I’m guess-
ing the Republicans reading
this piece are unanimously mad
at my audacious attack on their
kind. But just stay with me a little
while more, Republicans. Trust
me, I don’t hate you or your kind
all that much.

The main problem is that
some students seem to mix up
being a Libertarian and being a
Republican. If you are in love
with laissezfaire economics and
small government, you are a Re-
publican and not a Libertarian.
You can say that maybe you are
ﬁscally Republican and socially
Democrat, but even that combi-
nation does not mean you are a

real Libertarian. You need to go
a little ﬁirther.

Libertarians are an indepen-
dent party and to like anything
independent, you need to like it
a little too much.

To be into indie music, you
need to really like music. To
follow independent and smaller
leagues like the CFL or the MLS,
you need to like that certain

sport more than you should. To
choose RC Cola over Coke or
Pepsi, you should... get a CAT
scan because you probably
need a helmet. Still, you get
the point. Going outside of the
mainstream is hard work, and
you need to care about being
Libertarian a little too much.
Since I don’t hate all Liber-
tarians, just the ones who have
no idea what they are talking
about, I have come up with some
ways of knowing if your love for
Bob Barr and Ron Paul is legiti-
mate.

If you knew who Ron Paul
was before April 2008, you prob-
ably know what you are talking
about.

If you know anything about
the Libertarian platform besides
their basic ideals, you should not
have any issues.

Most importantly, if your
choice of political party has
somehow increased your number
of friends or hookups, you are
not a true Libertarian.

In high school, I had two
friends who decided early on
they wanted to be in independent

parties. The ﬁrst was a hardcore
Green Party member. He cam-
paigned heavily for Nadar and
would talk about seatbelts to
anyone who asked. Needless to
say, that did not get him far with
the opposite sex, so eventually he
just gave up, became a Democrat
and joined the rest of society.

My other friend, who was a
Libertarian, never got the memo
and ended up staying with his
independent party. And while
his friends were out making mis-
takes during their senior spring,
he was in his room watching Ron
Paul interviews.

These are two extreme cases
and most likely if you are a Lib-
ertarian, you will not lose friends.
That being said, to follow some-
thing you claim to like so much,
you need to put in some effort.

So all I ask is that if you are
not willing to put in that effort
(it’s 2009, the next real election
is three years away... don’t put
in the effort), then just man up
and tell people that you are a Re-
publican.

It’s not hard: all you are doing
is getting rid of one syllable and
defending George Bush a little
more than you would like to.

Trust me, you’ll be able to
sleep better at night.

Ladies and Gentlemen. . ..

Welcome to another year at
Washington & Lee. Fall is in the
unseasonably cool air. Perhaps
because we started at an oddly
late date in September, or per-
haps just because.

Once again, deep into the
night, music is pumping all along
Randolph Street and the scents
of Natural Light and authentic
Burberry perfumes waft out of
the doors of the Pole Houses.

Whatever the reason, we know
that W&L is back in business.

I’d like to welcome the newest
class of students. 2013, you’ve
chosen an interesting, demand-

that, if ﬁlmed, would make a fan-
tastic sequel to “Animal House.”
Or maybe a documentary on the
Discovery Channel.

I’d like to welcome you all to
this thrilling, challenging place,
and offer yet another challenge to
you: maintain your selves. Grow,
learn, thrive and maybe even
change throughout your college
experience, but do not lose your-
selves.

Your eccentricities are fantas-
tic. Your distinct personalities,
necessary. And your diverse pas-

the vivacity of our school.

While you are here, be open
to and embracing of others. Ev-
eryone makes mistakes, learns

crucial lessons, and decides who

time here.

The point of college is to
get a higher education. Falling
victim to narrow-mindedness is
anything but educated behavior.
Question the beliefs you came
here with, and certainly question
the ideas, behaviors and norms
that are presented to you here.

You will be pushed to look
at the world through fresh eyes.
Whther it be a topic in class, in
a social situation or in one of my

That being said, I welcome
the opportunity to discuss your
opinions with you, as I hope to
challenge some perspectives in

Abel Delgado takes President Ruscio is Convocation speech to heart

By Abel Delgado
co LU M N I sr

As I sat in front of Lee Chapel
for Convocation listening to Pres-
ident Ruscio give a timely and
necessary speech, one thought
kept going through my head: ‘I
wish more upperclassmen were
here to hear this.’ While most of
the students in the audience were
ﬁrst-years, the message to the up-
perclassmen was clear.

In much kinder and more elo-
quent words, President Ruscio
elaborated on a message some
of us needed to hear: grow up.

It is some of us upperclass-
men, after all, who have failed
to show anything remotely ap-
proaching appropriate behavior
for our age. The President, a
former W&L student himself,
rightfully called us out on it.

President Ruscio mentioned
two problems we upperclass-
men are accustomed to being
lectured about: sexual assault and
hazing.

We can all agree that there
should be no incidents of sexual
assault in an intellectual commu-
nity like ours that prides itself on
its honor and integrity.

But let’s be honest, the rea-
son the sexual assault rate is as
high as it is because some of us
believe that imbibing ridiculous

amounts of alcohol guarantees us
the right to act ridiculous and that
we should not be held responsible
for anything we do while drunk
and blackout.

Sexual assaults will go down
when the students, especially we
male students on this campus,
stop believing that Natty erases
responsibility, or that the Honor
System goes away at night.

There was one topic the Pres-
ident addressed that caught my
attention the most.

“Malicious words anony-
mously posted on intemet sites
are cowardly and shame all of
us,” Ruscio said. Cowardly is a
good way of putting it; patheti-
cally immature is another.

A few weeks ago, my friend
sent me a link to an open discus-

In much kinder and eloquent words, President

Ruscio elaborated on a message some of us

need to hear — grow up.

That same resurgence of re-
sponsibility could help to end
hazing, as well. We spend most
of our ﬁrst winter term quietly
complaining to our friends about
how rough we have it, and then
we go about the next three years
ensuring everyone who comes
after us has it just as bad.

This is notjust illogical, but
also petty and immature.

sion on the Class of 2013 Face-
book group. Like many upper-
classmen, I had given the group
page a glance-over once or twice
but I never got the urge to open a
fake account so I could ridicule
other organizations and people
on campus.

The discussion my friend
showed me regarded what up-
perclassmen were posting on an-

other site, ridiculing the entering
class even before they arrived on
campus.

The freshmen were rightfully
upset. Anonymous jerks had giv-
en them a rather poor impression
of what it meant to act honor-
ably.

We’re better than this. At
least, we should be.

What may seem as harmless
fun online can have some pretty
nasty results. Rumors spread like
wildﬁres on social networking
sites, and the damage done by
false ones is often unﬁxable in
small communities such as our
own.

I’m of the mind that if you’re
going to ridicule someone, you
should at least have the decency
to face him or her directly in per-
son. That way, the person can
respond.

These cowards, who signed
the same card during their fresh-
men year that we all did, promis-
ing to follow Lee’s one rule, have
failed to act like gentlemen.

We may not know who they
are, but they know. And if they
care in the least about what’s
makes this school “a place like no
other,” then they will take Presi-
dent Ruscio’s words to heart.

Sage advice for starting college with class

By Stephanie Hardlman
ARTS & LlFE EDITOR

After a week at W&L, you might
think you’ve got it all ﬁgured out.

You’re wrong.

Navigating the mineﬁeld of the
ﬁrst year is an art and one that re-
quires more than just a sweet posse
and Daddy’s credit card.

exciting and opens up a new chap-
ter of freedom in your life. But call
Mom once a week and tell her you
miss her. Let Dad know you wish
you were watching the football
game with him. You never know
when you might need to make bail,

“When you get drunk and pee yourself on Windfall

or do something unprintable at Late Night, some-

one will be there to notice, and then they will tell

EVERYONE. ”

The pattern you set this year will
pave the way for the rest of your
college career. As a good Samaritan,
I’m providing some tips to make
sure you come out on top:

Don’t get over-involved — It’s
easy to get wrapped up in the e-mail
lists and beckoning of the obligatory
Domino’s dinners at evening meet-
ings. But no one can be a star mem-
ber in every club, and eventually
people learn they can’t count on you
because you’re spread too thin. Pick
a few things you’re really commit-
ted to, be involved, stick with them,
and maybe in a year or two you’ll be
made the group’s president.

Know your place — No one likes
the know-it-all ﬁrst-year whose sole
aim is to show up other students
and impress the prof. As President
Ruscio said during my ﬁrst O-Week,
“90 percent of you were in the top 10
percent of your class. In 12 weeks,
only 10 percent of you will be.” So
get off your high horse and learn
some humility. You may have been
Christ lncamate in high school, but
here no one cares. We were all that
person. We’ve been here longer than
you have. Earn your keep.

Stay on your parents’ good side
— Being away from Mom and Dad is

and good relations with the ‘rents
are always in style.

Don’t be a fool — One ofthe perks
of winter rush is that upperclassmen
get to know you before extending
a bid. When you get drunk and pee
yourself on Windfall or do some-
thing unprintable at Late Night,
someone will be there to 119.108, and
then they will tell EVERYONE. And
then you will be known by an inap-
propriate nickname instead of your
given name (or your middle name if
you’re one of “those” people).

Enjoy this time you’re given
~ This is a time of blissful unaware-
ness. You don’t yet have to worry
about bills, fraﬂsrat drama, applying
to grad school, degree requirements,
deciding if you should marry your
college sweetheart or ﬁnding a job.

Some day it’ll be May of senior
year and you’ll be one of the 15 mil-
lion unemployed people out there,
thinking maybe you should’ve just
become a police ofﬁcer like Steve
from high school because at least
then you’d have a job. And you’ll
think back on this time fondly, sigh,

- and head to the Palms to drown your

sorrows.
Let this be a lesson.

_ Volleyball shows strength against SVU

Generals close out W&L Invitational at 3-1 to open the season, team hopes for a ninth ODAC championship

By Adam Cancryn
smrr wrmsn

A thrilling ﬁve-set victory over
Southern Virginia University salvaged a
tough opening weekend for Washington
& Lee’s women’s volleyball team.

After suffering two losses on the
ﬁrst day of the W&L Invitational Tour-
nament, the Generals dominated SVU’s
front line with power hitting and solid
blocking to notch their ﬁrst win of the
season. '

Junior middle blocker Louise Brooks
led the team with 20 kills and sopho-
more middle blocker Lindsey Dee add-
ed 10 kills, providing a steady offensive
presence throughout the back-and-forth
match.

W&L jumped on SVU from the start,
taking an early 10-3 lead. Overmatched
at the net, Southern Virginia could not
respond to the Generals’ multiple hit-
ting options. Led by Brooks, Dee and
senior outside hitter Rachael Phillips,
W&L grew the margin to 10 before
cruising to a 25-14 victory.

However, a markedly improved
SVU defense stalled W&L’s offense,
allowing SVU to respond and take the
second set, 25-19.

Southern Virginia looked primed to
take the third set as well after opening
with a 10-4 lead, but a string of great
blocks led to an 11-3 Generals run that
put them ahead for good.

Pushed to the brink, SVU rallied for
a 25-21 fourth-set victory to force a de-

cisive ﬁnal set.

Early in set ﬁve, Brooks overpow-
ered SVU’s defense with two outside
kills, giving W&L an apparent 8-7 edge

as the teams switched sides. But after
a brief delay, oﬂicials determined that

the Generals had served out of rotation, '

a penalty that cost them a point and the
lead. ‘
Suddenly down, W&L responded by
tying it with a kill from sophomore out-
side hitter Megan Daily. Though SVU
took the lead late at 15-14, the Generals’

said. “We stayed aggressive and [SVU]
didn’t  I thought that was a big key.”

The Generals ﬁnished the weekend
1-3 following a 3-0 Saturday evening

loss to top-ranked Emory University.
But Snider said W&L’s tomnament
play met his expectations.

“This is our ﬁrst weekend playing,
and all of the other teams have already
played,” he said. “I was pretty pleased
in general. You never like to lose, but
I thought the girls played hard and ex-
ecuted a lot of the things that we’re try-

"We knew it ’d be tough and thats why we brought these

teams in here. We stayed agressive and [S VU] didn ’t...I

thought that was a big key. ’

BRIAN SNIDER, Head Coach

overwhelming hitting power carried the
team to a 20-18 win that clinched the
match.

The win showed serious improve-

ment from their opening round, 3-0
losses to both Christopher Newport and
second-ranked Juniata, said head coach
Brian Snider.

“We knew it’d be tough. The com-
petition was extremely tough and that’s
why we brought these teams in here,” he

ing to do.” . ’

W&L is looking to capture its ninth
consecutive ODAC Championship.
Though the team lost a few key play-
ers, the pieces are still in place for the
veteran team to make a run through the
conference.

Phillips, the reigning ODAC Player
of the Year, teamed with Brooks to re-
cord 78 kills in four matches. Add in the
increased inﬂuence of Dee, who regis-

tered more kills over the weekend than
she did all of last year, and W&L can
gain the front-line advantage over most
other teams. ‘

But the key will be the play of the
back line following the institution of a
new defensive system. Snider said that
he wants to limit the movement in the
back and give his players the freedom
to go after the ball.

Much of the new strategy’s suc-
cess will hinge on the performance of
W&L’s only ﬁrst-year starter, libero
Cameron Hill. In addition to acting as a

defensive specialist, she must coordi-
nate the entire team’s defense.

“We’re putting a lot on her, respon-
sibility-wise,” said Snider. “But she
took huge steps forward this week-
end.”

W&L will face Randolph-Macon
on September 16 in its ﬁrst confer—.
ence match.

° First-years lead at W&L Invitational

Both the mens and women is cross country teams looked strong in the season opener this weekend

By Rebecca Mickel and
Alex Cummings
STAFF WRITERS

“Run like you stole something.”

‘That was the phrase that pushed
Washington & Lee runners to the ﬁnish
line as they opened_ their cross country
season with the Washington and Lee In-
vitational on Saturday and it was good
enough to steal some victories.

The season opener, hosted at the Dick
Miller Cross Country course, showed
promising expectations for the upcom-
ing season.

The women’s team completed the 5K
with an average time of 21 :34.20, while
the men’s team completed the 8K with
an average time of 29:23.20.

Both the women’s and men’s teams
ﬁnished the meet in second place, los-
ing out only to the University of Mary
Washington.

The men’s team was led by ﬁrst-year
Harrison Tucker who took ﬁrst place
with a time of 28245. Junior Joe Stusek
ﬁnished fourth with a time of 29:22, fol-
lowed by ﬁrst-year Tyler Gehrs in sev-
enth with a time of 29:30.

F irst-year Lauren Schultz was the top

runner for the women’s team, turning
out a second-place ﬁnish with a time of
20:41. Senior Kat Telfeyan‘ also turned

“It’s so helpful to have an upperclass-
man as a mentor to work out with and
run next to during practice and meets,”

"Its a lot of fun this year. We have a really great

group dynamic, and we hope to continue working well
together. I wouldn’t trade this for the world. ”

ROSEMARY KELLEY, senior

in an impressive ﬁnish for the Generals,
coming in fourth with a time of 21 : 14.

But for the W&L cross country
coaches, more focus is being placed
upon group effort, rather individual suc-
cess.

In her seventh year as the head wom-
en’s cross country coach, Kris Hoey, has
placed emphasis on the buddy strategy,
inspiring this year’s fairly young team
with the motto “Partners in Crime.” So
far, the strategy seems to be working.

said Schultz.

After losing four of last year’s top
seven runners, the team is looking to
make the most out of its new runners.
And in the ﬁrst meet of the season, the
newcomers proved they could handle the
pressure, with a ﬁrst-year runner leading
both the men’s and women’s teams.

“The freshmen did a great job step-
ping up and recognizing the spaces that
needed to be ﬁlled,” said senior captain
Dorothy Todd.

While Todd and fellow captain Kath-
erine F enwick are currently injured and
were unable to race this weekend, their
enthusiasm was in no way diminished.

“It’s good to be able to turn them on
from the sideline, and it also gives a dif-
ferent perspective about what needs to
be done,” said F enwick.

With practices six days a week, the
team focuses on developing race pace
and uses tempo training to increase
speed and to strengthen endurance. But
then strenuous schedule does not com-
promise the teammates’ overall sense of
camaraderie.

“It’s a lot of fun this year,” said se-

nior Rosemaiy Kelley, who ﬁnished in
13th place with a time of 22: 12.

“We have a really great group dy-
namic, and we hope to continue work-
ing well together. I wouldn’t trade this
for the world.” ‘

Next on tap for the men’s team is
the Guilford Invitational next Satur-
day. Both teams will be back in action
the following weekend at the Roanoke

Invitational in a preview of the ODAC
Championship course.

W&L football bounces back

Generals improve to 1-1 with a 31-13 victory over Sewanee Saturday

By Andrew Bonds
smrr wmn-zn

The Generals (1-1) recovered from
their close 29-27 loss to Franklin & Mar-
shall in last week’s home opener with a
decisive 31-13 victory over long-time ri-
val Sewanee. The Generals’ offense put
them ahead on the scoreboard, but the
true story of the game was Washington &
Lee’s defensive performance. With seven
combined turnovers between the two
teams, senior captain defensive lineman
Matt Cassilly led the defensive effort, re-
cording four tackles, one tackle for a loss,
one sack, and two interceptions, one of
which was returned for a game-changing
touchdown‘ with 13:04 left in the second
quarter.

“Cassilly was unreal,” said fellow
senior defensive lineman Beau Craparo.
“His performance today was one of the
best I have ever seen since I have been
playing football here. As a team 1 think
we played really well. Our offense is still
evolving, but overall I think it was a solid
game.” ,

Cassilly’s strong play was comple-
mented by senior defensive back Donavon
Sawyer’s eight tackles and one intercep-
tion, and senior defensive lineman Rick
Barron’s seven tackles.

Offensively, the Generals continued to
utilize the spread option, with sophomore
quarterback Charlie Westfal leading the
team on the ground, rushing for 70 yards
and a touchdown. With the loss of Stuart
Sitterson, one of the most statistically ac-

complished players in W&L football his- 3

tory, the Generals have added shotgun sets
to their offense as they look to throw the
ball more than last year. However, sopho-

already stepped into his new role, running
for 50 yards and two touchdowns.

and overcame a late game drive by the Ti-
gers to win the game.

“Today was a big game for us, espe-
cially after last week,” said sophomore
tight end Jake Tunney. “Sewanee was a
good team, but we just outlasted them and
made more plays late in the game.”

Simply making more plays when it
counted seemed to be the theme of the
game, as the defense was able to force
more turnovers than the offense gave up,
in large part because of Cassi1ly’s one-
man show.

Coming off of the ﬁrst win of the sea-
son, the Generals will face Greensboro
College next Saturday at 1:00 p.m. on

Field hockey keeps ‘heads held high’
W&L ﬁeld hockey player Lizz Dye takes us behind the scenes of this
weekends opening games against Johns Hopkins and McDaniel

By Lizz Dye
surr wrmza

Nothing in sports brings more antici-
pation, excitement, adrenaline, and fear
than the ﬁrst game of the season, espe-
cially when your ﬁrst opponent is No. 11-’
ranked Johns Hopkins University. On a
cool Friday evening under the lights we,
the Generals Field Hockey Team, played
Johns Hopkins University in an exciting
well-fought game. We had only played
together as a team for two weeks before
we had to face the Blue Jays, who were
already 2-0. But we knew from previous
experience that we were going to bring
our best to the ﬁeld.

From the beginning, each team played
with heart. The drive to win was evident
on both sides. The Blue Jays struck ﬁrst: a
little over 13 minutes into the game, Johns
Hopkins senior forward Gabi Henn scored
the ﬁrst goal of the game off an assist from
fellow senior forward Andrea Vandersall.
Standing on the sideline, I could tell that
we were frustrated by the goal, but the
cheers from our team and our fans kept
our heads held high. Five minutes later,
the Blue Jays managed to score again
with an unassisted goal by their ﬁrst-year
forward Meghan Kellett. We suffered an-
other blow when junior midﬁelder Emmy
Mathews was taken out by ‘a yellow card
for ﬁve minutes near the end of the ﬁrst
half, and we were forced to play one down
against the formidable Blue Jays.

But despite the setbacks of the ﬁrst
half, we overcame our initial ﬁrst-game
jitters and held Johns Hopkins scoreless in
the second half. Head Coach Wendy Or-
rison told us that there was a noticeable
improvement in intensity from the ﬁrst

half to the second. She also said that al-

ing for the game against McDaniel that we
had the next day.

The mantra for the 2009 Generals’
ﬁeld hockey team is, “We will protect
this house,” and we did just that against
McDaniel. Excited to prove ourselves af-
ter the loss to Johns Hopkins, we headed
into the game with the same intensity we
brought to the second half of the Hopkins
game. Crisp,'sharp passing was one goal
we had set before the game and it became
a major factor in our overall success. 33

seven minutes left, the Generals executed
a tremendous play perfectly, sending in
a game-winning goal from senior Alex
Caritis off an assist by sophomore Chris-
tina Benedetti. Other highlights included
four saves by senior goalkeeper Caroline
Habliston. With two games down, now we
can focus on our Friday match-up against
Christopher Newport. -
