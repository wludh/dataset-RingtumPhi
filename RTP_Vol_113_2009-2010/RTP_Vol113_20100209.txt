Extending
education

W&L students volunteer at
local elementary school

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

While many W&L students are involved on
campus, others extend their dedication off campus
at Lexington’s Harrington Waddell Elementary
School. Located just an eight-minute walk from
W&L’s campus, Waddell Elementary school offers
volunteer positions for a large number of W&L stu-
dents.

Students often seek internship hours for W&L’s
education classes or st dent-teaching opportunities,
but most students simply volunteer to tutor in a va-
riety of subjects ranging from math classes to art
enrichment programs.

According to Kevin Kendall, the Gifted Edu-
cation Coordinator at Waddell, the most popular
programs that W&L students help out with are the
weekly “tech time” sessions, where students help
ﬁrst grade classes become accustomed to using
computers and other forms of technology and the
writing mentorship program. This program features
advanced student writers at W&L, or students who
have enrolled in creative writing courses.

The Junior Great Books Book Club is also popu-_

lar among W&L students. Elementary school stu-
dents are encouraged to read age appropriate litera-
ture and discuss its literary forms, as they would in
middle or high school.

Kindergarteners at Waddell also beneﬁt from the
work of W&L students. Kristin Tomlin, Waddell’s
school counselor, is in charge of the Kindergaiten
Readers Program. Currently, over 30 undergraduate
and law students give 30 minutes of their time to
listen to kindergarteners read short books.

First-year Ashley Astolﬁ helps kindergarteners
with their reading speed. She said she enjoys work-
ing with children and seeing them improve.

’ ‘‘It’s so much better when you get to know them,
because it makes their success yours, too. lt’s really
something to celebrate,” Astolﬁ said.

Tomlin also coordinates after-school tutoring and
the Homework Help Program for Waddell students,
many of whom suffer from difﬁculties in school or

at home. Over 25 W&L students tutor‘ individual‘

students in kindergarten through ﬁfth grade for one
hour a week.

Both administrators at Waddell give praise to
W&L students for their work. Some student tutors
are unable to commit to tutoring on a weekly basis,
but that has been the only problem.

“Our volunteers are genuinely invested,” said
Tomlin.

Students who are interested in giving their time to
Waddell should contact the Nabors Service League
Children’s Contact Chair, junior Kate Donnelly.

Donnelly serves as a link between W&L students
and tutoring opportunities in Rockbridge County.
Working with Kendall, Tomlin and local parents,
Donnelly uses her connections through her two var-
sity sports teams and her sorority to f. id volunteers.

Surprisingly, she said, she has found great suc-
cess in Campus Notices as well. Donnelly’s in-
volvement with the Nabors Service League started
last year when she served as a reading volunteer at
Waddell and Lexington’s Yellow Brick Road Early
Learning Center.

Along with her Nabors work, Donnelly plays
both ﬁeld hockey and lacrosse, leaving her no time
to volunteer herself.

“I love kids, though. lt’s really rewarding, so this
is one way I can help them,” she said.

Donnelly anticipates a future career in public
policy or community development, but she plans to
continue her role in Nabors next year. I’

“I love being able to connect students with the
local community and see how many students are so
eager to help,” she said. /

W&L students seem to genuinely enjoy their
time at Waddell. Kendall is grateful that the volun-
teers are notjust seniors trying to rack up activities
for their resumes, but underclassmen as well.

“The vast majority of volunteers want to be in-
volved in the community and work with kids. I get a
sense that they want to come back year after year,”
Kendall said.

Waddell is always looking for volunteers in
classes or after-school programs, for a variety of
lengths of time. Those interested in volunteering
can Contact Kate Donnelly at (donnellyk11@maz'l.

Provost June“/lprille issues half a snow’ day;

Rumors created a ﬂurry around
Lexington this past week, with talk
of an impending winter wallop. The
storm hit Friday, accumulating on
what remained from the previous
weekend. Virginia Governor Bob
McDonnell declared a state of emer-

ferent,” she said.

Administration conferred with
facility workers who arrived first on
campus and thus saw conditions ﬁrst.

_most inclement weather. Dining Ser-
vice workers make up part of the Es-
sential Personnel Staff(EPS), desig-
nated employees who know ahead of
time when their services are needed.
Because the storm occurred during

Lexington amassed nearly 8.3 inches of.snow by 9 a.m. on Saturday, Feb. 6, according to
the National Weather Service.

gency, the second this year. Kroger
was chaotic, stores in the heart of
Lexington closed and a heightened
sense of anticipation swirled around.

Provost June Aprille, whose job
includes canceling class in the event
of bad weather, attributed the hype to
Lexington’s relative lack of experi-
ence with heavy snow.

“The town and county have not
invested heavily in snow removal
equipment as would be typical for
more wintery climates, and local
roads may not be cleared promptly,”
she explained in an email.

With such extreme forecasts,
Washington and Lee administration
met Thursday morning to discuss ac-
tion for Friday, but Aprille typically
makes decisions by 5:00 or 6:00 a.m.
the morning ofthe storm.

“I try to make the best decision I

their commute was and how things
are looking.” At 5:00 a.m. Friday,
the snow was still light, temperatures
were above freezing and no major
accumulation was expected before
noon, so administration deemed a
12:00 p.m. closing sufﬁcient, pre-
serving morning classes. Students
received an email at 8:40 a.m. con-
ﬁrming that afternoon classes would
not take place. '

Aprille acknowledged that deci-»

sions were somewhat rushed and the
cutofftime should have been 12:10,
the oﬁicial end of D-block. She said,
“I hope students did not get up en
masse and walk out at noon!”

Many were worried about D-Hall,
especially after the issues caused by

the December 18th snowstorm. Dean ‘

of Students Dawn Watkins explained
that because D-Hall is a necessary

the regular school calendar, running
D-Hall was a matter of maintaining
current production instead of power-
ing back up.

Though D-Hall continued ser-
vice, sorority dining was modiﬁed:
regular meals were cancelled for the
day. An improvised deli bar was ar-
ranged, but most sorority women
scrambled to restaurants or just ate at
their off-campus houses. .

Getting to and from off-campus
houses was not an easy feat. Anyone
‘who did not feel conﬁdent travel-
ling was encouraged to use personal
judgment, even in regard to a class.
Junior Caroline Bovay, who lives
in the country, said she appreciated
“the University’s policy regarding
inclement winter weather: only drive
to campus if you feel you can do it
safely.” Even though she came to

STEELE BURROW/ Staff Photographer

students push through inclement weather

campus at 8:15 a.m., well before the
noon cutoff, she said “it was com-
forting to have that backing from the
University.”

Bovay said she worried about
getting to campus from the Windfall
area without four-wheel drive., al-
though she granted that roads were
better maintained for this storm than
December’s. “It seems like the city is
far more prepared this time around,”
though getting from her house to a
thoroughfare was still a challenge.

Thankfully, she arrived on cam-
pus successfully, but she saw cars
that were not as lucky, citing “two
students’ cars that either spun out of
control or skidded into a ditch.” She
sais she wished that the University
cancelled classes earlier so that these
students would not have risked com-
ing to campus at all.

On the other hand, students who
live on campus found getting to class
easy, as snow plows worked through
the night to clear paths between
buildings. Plowing shifts occurred at
3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. Snow shov-
elers and public safety olﬁcers also
fall under the EPS umbrella, ensur-
ing their presence on campus despite
the storm.

Shoveling ensured pedestrian
safety, but evening transportation
was questionable at best. Clay Cole-
man, Director of Student Affairs
and Greek Life, spoke to fraternity
leadership about risk management
due to the severe weather, especial-
ly discouraging driving. Freshmen
pledges were banned from driving to
and from fraternity functions. Like-
wise, Traveller did not run because
the University could not ensure pas-
senger safety. j

However, the lack of drivers did
not prevent students from going out.
If anything, the snow encouraged
parties, as the weekend began earlier
than anticipated. Students went sled-
ding during the day and walked to
parties at night. So while administra-
tion overcame a signiﬁcant technical
concern, W&L students enjoyed an
out-of-the-ordinary long weekend. ‘

Channeling Keynes: Obama and the 2011 budget

The new proposed budget for 2011 is rife with overspending and unwise decisions A

By Jarrett Brotzman
c 0 L U M N I s T

On Monday, President Obama
released his budget for the 2011
ﬁscal year.

Following his State of the
Union address, many anticipated
his budget to address the critical
issues facing the country: unem-
ployment, job creation and the
looming budget crisis. I

Actions indeed do speak
louder than words, and his inten-
tions for larger state intervention

As Obama made clear dur-
ing his State of the Union ad-
dress, job creation is his number
one priority. But oddly enough,
every tax increase he advocates
through his budget will act di-
rectly against this goal of job cre-
ation and boosting the economy.

The list of new taxes is quite
long, and the implications of
these increases are quite dra-
matic. On the surface, the 2011

pork from which he rewards all
of his political supporters.

The minute details of these
tax increases are scarier than
one would initially think. Busi-
nesses, to put it lightly, are go'-
ing to be placed at a great com-
petitive disadvantage relative to
other corporations around the
world. In plain English, the very
reason international corporations

in the economy are made clear in
a plan of higher taxes for every-
one and an anti-business agenda
that will prevent business growth
and do nothing to alleviate inves-
tor uncertainty.

This budget shows the true
nature of the growing, revenue-
hungry Keynesian monster in
Washington.

budget reveals an increase of
$175 billion in personal income
taxes, a $117 billion increase in
corporate income taxes, and only
a miniscule decrease of $21 bil-
lion in discretionary spending
(WSJ, 2/2).

Obama has made a big deal
about ﬁscal responsibility, but
he still ﬁnds it too difﬁcult to cut

do business in America (a legal
and tax environment favorable to
growth and freer enterprise) will
greatly diminish.

The most damaging com-
ponent of the new business tax
would be the elimination of
tax advantages to do business
abroad. These advantages were
created in order to allow for a

corporation to not pay taxes on
oversea earnings if the oversea

country in question required tax- -

es on the same earnings. Origi-
nally, the business tax eliminated
double taxation on the corpora-
tions that hire hundreds of thou-
sands, if not millions, of Ameri-
can workers.

Under Obama’s 2011 budget,
the United States will be the only
country in the world to tax the
oversea earnings of its corpora-
tions without provisions to pre-
vent double taxation.

Increasing these taxes will re-
sult in the ﬁring of thousands of
American workers. Sounds like
a great plan to revive growth and
decrease the unemployment rate.
But wait, I forgot, the govem—
ment can take all of this new rev-

‘ enue and spend it more eﬁiciently
with respect to employment than
any corporation can. That’s why
there was the stimulus package,
and why the unemployment rate
has fallen dramatically.

Individual American taxpay-
ers have even more to fear in this
budget than simply the prospect
of losing a job. Personal income
taxes for the top two brackets,
after the expiration of tax cuts

on those making more than
$250,000 a year expire, will see
increases on the marginal tax
brackets from 33 to 35 percent,
and from 36 to 39.6 percent. This
alone will stiﬁe spending and in-
vestment from the upper incomes
in America, but the beatings con-
tinue to all income levels across
every tax bracket.

Obama also wants fewer in-

vestors to invest in long-term-

holdings. That is the only con-
clusion that can be reached from
the increase in capital gains and
dividend taxes from 15 to 20 per-
cent. The new budget also seeks
to include earnings from interest
(from savings accounts) treated
as regular income, and as a re-
sult, taxed as such.

This directive hits each and
every family in America but

undermines the incentives built

into the prior tax code which
both saves and invests in com-

panies that employ millions of

Americans. Increasing the cost
of working, much like increas-
ing the costs of doing business
in America, is one of the worst
ways to boost the economy.

The U.S. economy is still ane-
mic, at best. Paralyzed by uncer-

tainty, stemming in part from the
temporary and artiﬁcial stimulus
from Washington, investors have
just received the worst possible
news: capital gains and dividend
taxes are going to be raised, on
top of the already catastrophic
possibility of strengthening la-
bor unions through card check,
preferential treatment for orga-

' nized labor under new healthcare
legislation, and near limitless in-
creases on business regulation
and taxation.

The government’s role in the
economy should focus on creat-
ing a safe and stable system of
rules in which a market economy
can prosper. The current trend
of federal regulation is acting
completely counter to this phi-
losophy, and Keynesian inspired
policy has again taken a hold of
Washington.

Ifthis policy is continued,job
creation and investor conﬁdence
is likely to continue to stagnate.

Dems’ problems come from policies, not lack of backbone

Democrats have much

By Abel Delgado
COLUMNIST

Summer Lollie was half right
when she said it’s been a tough
year for liberal Democrats. It’s
been an extremely tough year for
Democrats. The reason for that is
that they can no longer claim to
be liberal.

Pundits tend to throw around
the words “liberal” and “con-
servative” with little concern
over their original meanings.
President George W. Bush was
a “conservative” who aimed at

changing everything from the
national security structure, to
public education, to the tax code,
to the Constitution. What exactly
was he trying to conserve? His-
torically, liberals have been the
ones who have been pro-indi-
vidual freedom and anti-govem-
ment control.

What then, is so liberal about

President Obama’s current agen- »

da? Democrats are no longer lib-
eral. They are social-Democrats,

I recognize socialist is a
bad word in this country, but it
shOuldn’t be. If that is what you
are, then that is what you should
call yourself.

The real problem for Demo-
crats is that, regardless of what
they call themselves, Americans

you do with your life as long as
it doesn’t affect them.

George W. Bush’s actions fol-
lowed the completely opposite
mindset of those sentiments. That
is why Democrats regained pow-
er. Nominating centrist “blue-
dog” Democrats, who had very
little in common with the out-

bigger issues than Summer Lollie is proposed lack of assertion

through. A bill that gives cover-
age to less than 10 percent of all
Americans while costing well
over $800 billion ~ that’s eleven
zeroes for those of you counting
at home - is not going to make
very many voters happy.

The reason the Wall Street
bailout turned out to be such a
misuse of money is because Re-
publicans and Democrats got to-
gether to make their rich donors
happy. Reasonable opposition
was ignored.

A similar problem happened
with the stimulus bill that only
ended up further stimulating our
already-stimulated national debt.

Obstruction is a great thing
when political leaders, of either
party, manipulate crises to get
shameful bills passed, and when
the vast majority of legislators
do not even read the bills they
are voting for.

So if Democrats “grow a

Each fraternity’s weekend custom for greeting the day

After a long night of partying, every fraternity chooses an incredibly unique way to welcome the next morning

Beta — Rolling out ofbed with
no clothes on, the typical Beta
immediately goes to his closet to
pick out the proper outﬁt for the
day. He strenuously avoids the
shower or any kind of deodorant
in favor of the much more popu-
lar body odor dujour.

Once the closet is opened, he
chooses from his myriad differ-
ent clothing selections. Should
he wear a throwback Carmelo
jersey or a Lebron away jersey?
He shrugs andjust throws on any
old ambiguous basketball jersey
accompanied by a ﬁtted cap,
which works well for some and
poorly for others.

Before he calls up his chick
that he will inevitably settle for,
he gets into a ﬁght with a lamp
post for “looking at him weird"
and “talking shit.”

KA— Smelling something un-
pleasant in the air, the KA leaps
out of bed and looks around vig-
orously to make sure that there
isn’t anyone watching him from
afar.

He tweaks his neck a little and
heads into the shower. He can’t
really ﬁgure out all the blasted
knobs that make the water go, so
instead he favors the much more
efﬁcient head-butt-of-the—wall to
get the water started. For some
strange reason, he can‘t stop
scratching his neck. It must have
been from a hook-up the night
before or something like that.

Even though it is eight in the
morning and he’s only slept for
three hours, the KA is still tre-
mendously excited about the
upcoming football game. In fact,
he can’t stop talking about it. But
before he leaves to attend, he
calls up his ENT doctor to set up
an appointment.

Lambda — The Lambda
wakes up with a frustrated
scream. He cannot believe that
he forgot the next number in the
Fibonacci sequence after 89 and
144. He scours the intemet, us-
ing W&L-approved sources of
course, to ﬁnd the next number,
233.

After breathing a strong sigh
of relief, he remembers that yes,
he was at a party last night, and
once again the worry sets in. He
now browses Facebook, looking
for that one incriminating photo
that will inevitably lead to him
getting kicked off the SJC or EC,
which he knows will jeopardize
any dream he has of becoming
senator one day.

Luckily there is not a single

SNU — Right around 7:30
or so, the Snu wakes up with a
hangoverebut not enough of a
hangover to let that beloved GPA
falter.

He wouldn’t normally wake
up this early, but TNT is show-
ing an all-day marathon of“Lord

the room to try and establish
exactly where he is. He realizes
that the other person in the room
is still sleeping comfortably on
their bed.

He quietly puts on his sweat-
shirt and writes a party email on
the sleeping person’s computer.
Before opening the door, he
drops a couple offliers inside the
doorway just to make sure that
everyone is completely positive
that, yes, something with some
kind of theme is happening at
Pole “Extreme” tonight.

As he walks out of the Gra-

maybe 4 pm. you had a particularly adventurous night, where

you are the most vulnerable, and therefore the easiest to classify.

 

bering that the house was al-
ready spotless by around 10:30
the night before. Free at last,
he decides to immediately start
planning a party with the obliga-
tory late night plan of Pole One
around nine or so.

PiKA — The ABBA alarm
clock sounds and the PiKA
springs out ofbed more energetic
than the night before.

He joins his friends for a
quick game of handball to start
the day. He thinks that they can
get around 15 to 20 games in
before noon. but he can only get
four in before getting too tired.

Now sweaty, he decides to
take a long, soothing bubble bath
to exfoliate those pores and re-
lax a little. He attempts to shave,
but then he remembers that he
doesn‘t have any facial hair.

He throws on his V-neck that
matches hisjeans perfectly. Now
fully clean and exercised, he can
return to College ACB for the
day‘s entertaimnent.

SAE — The typical SAE for-
got to turn off the SEC Network
last night, so highlights of Mark
lngram’s touchdown against
Texas force him to wake up a
little earlier than expected.

Groggy from three too many
mixes of SoCo and Evan Wil-
liams, his head is left in a dire
state. To feel better, he bypasses
his Lynyrd Skynyrd album in
favor of some quality Old Crow
Medicine Show. After getting his
daily exercise from the ensuing
air guitar session, he showers and
dons his hunting gear and camou-

of the Rings,” and there is abso-
lutely no way that he will miss
another shot of Gandalf turning
from gray to white.

After having a little chat with
LexPo about the thorough preva-
lence of indecent acts in Lexing-
ton, he showers thoroughly, mak-
ing sure to hit every pore with the
penetrating ProActiv solution.

Today will be a day for not
going outside, so he shuts the
blinds and puts on his vintage
Darth Vader T-shirt, puts some
buttered popcorn in the micro-
wave, turns on DirectTV and en-

joys his weekend.

Sig Ep — Normally, SAE‘s
blasting ofOld Crow would im-
mediately awaken the Sig Ep,
but unfortunately his ears are
still ringing from the gnarly jam
session the night before, when he
and all of his friends seamlessly
held the same jive rhythm for
three solid hours.

He waits until the ringing in
his ears stop before he scours
YouTube to ﬁnd the next come-
dian to invite over to W&L on
bchalfof GAB.

Being the “new age" frater-
nity, the Sig Ep foregoes party
planning in favor ofcalling Tick-
etmaster to see if Phish is hav-
ing a concert in the area anytime
soon. The stained paper with the
unicorn on his desk says they
might.

Sig Chi — The Sigma Chi
wakes up in a room foreign to
him. He has a dead arm from
spending such a long time on a
dormitory ﬁoor. He looks around

 but the Saints won the
           Superbowl.        

laments to himself, “Only three
more weeks of rush.” He then
spends the rest of the morning
devising a plan to get girls drunk
at his house before they head
over to Phi Delt.

Phi Delt — The Phi Delt was
already tempted to wake up
around seven in the morning
when he told his sleeping “bed-
mate” to leave within ﬁve min-
utes or else. However, he wanted
to sleep in a little longerjust to
bask in the glory ofhis own pres-
ence.

When he ﬁnally does wake
up, the ﬁrst place he heads is
the bathroom. He turns on the
shower, and while waiting for it
to warm up, he catches himself
in the mirror and gets lost for a
while.

After three or four layers of
Aussie conditioner, he starts to
dry off before catching himself
in the mirror. He picks up his

$65 hair brush and is about to
start brushing before remember-
ing that his hair is perfect and
doesn’t need to be touched. He
then starts to shave, but only just
enough to make sure that ﬁve-
7o’clock shadow is still intact
once he’s done.

After yet another mirror ses-
sion, he goes downstairs to play
some “Call of Duty” on PS3.
However, once he gets there he
wonders out loud, “Where the
hell is my controller?”

Fiji — I’m sorry, I couldn’t

Phi Psi — A sharp intestinal
pain wakes up the Phi Psi, and he
heads to the bathroom complain-
ing how that day’s ﬂag football
game is now ruined simply be-
cause he was hungry.

After getting ready for the
day, he heads downstairs to hang
out with the rest of his motley
crew of a fraternity. Although he
is from Pennsylvania, he and his
fraternity turn on NESN to see
the “Sawx,” the team that he and
the rest of his pledge class has
identiﬁed with since birth.

He plans on spending the en-
suing time after the Sawx game
preparing the entrance to Fallout
to make sure that each and every-
one can get in.

Phi Kap - Like Brandtford
Winstonworth, the typical Phi
Kap doesn’t technically wake up
alone. He has the beautiful War-
rior Noz Head and shaft to keep
him company.

He strokes his lettuce and
bros out in bed for a while be-
fore properly greeting the day.
He dons some dank gear that he
bought at the Darien Sport Shop.
The pastels will impress the la-
dies for sure.

Even though it’s the weekend,
the true Phi Kap never lays off
his work life. Bros aren’t about

 
 
 
   
  
     
     
   
 
     

hanging out; they are about mak-
ing bank. Today, he will make his
bank the proper way by walking
downstairs and picking up his
check from Benny.

Later, he makes sure to re-
send in his application to Gold-
man Sachs since the last four
must have gotten lost in the mail.
Now that he’s done making pres-
ent and ﬁiture bank, he lounges
around the house waiting for the
girls to inevitably come.

Chi Psi — The typical Chi
Psi hits the ﬂoor rolling out of
bed. Last night was pretty over-
whelming. His arms are very
sore after playing hours and
hours of Donkey Kong on the
pipes the night before. Oh well,
at least the swim team appreci-
ated this version of“Chi Psi
Late Nite.”

Today is a busy day, so he
gets ready quickly. He austerely
pats his unkempt hair, trying
to somehow get it presentable
enough to have the United
States government approve of it.

He will now spend the entire
day driving up to Washington,
D.C., and trying as best as he
can to convince US Customs
officials that they should not
deport the 2009-2010 Chi Psi
pledge class. Why were they so
lazy with those green cards?

Merritt examining what ‘real’ re-

As usual, The Magnetic Fields
deliver hyper-thoughtful, super-

Generals struggle after sloppy performance

Turnovers plagued the women is basketball team all week, but W&L still pulled out two victories over-Randolph and Lynchburg

Bylstephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Generals came into this past
week playing some of their best bas-
ketball of the season. Stiﬁing defense,
MVP-esque performances from sopho-
more forward Becca Bolton, and an of-
fensive attack that was ﬁnally clicking

road. We have not been shooting well,
but we battled back to make it a very
close game. Randolph is a scrappy
team, but we held out and ﬁnished it to
the last possession.”

W&L traveled to VWC last Tuesday

“Our last two games were not our best, and we did not

play at our usual level. But we have been working hard

in practice and we are planning on winning the rest of

our games this season. ” Becca Bolton, forward

 

provided the recipe for victory in seven
of their last eight games. But Washing-
ton and Lee (10-8, 9-5) cooled off con-
siderably during their last two contests
falling to Virginia Wesleyan 60-58 and
narrowly beating Randolph College 53-
51.

“This last week was pretty tough for
us,” said junior forward Felice Herman.
“With long hours and a weird schedule,
it has really challenged us during our
games. Virginia Wesleyan is always
a tough game for us, especially on the

looking to continue its four-game win-
ning streak, but the Generals couldn’t
ﬁnd their stride until the second half.
They trailed 32-24 at the intermission,
but came roaring out of the locker-room
on an 11-0 run to brieﬂy take the lead.
Free throws from Bolton and buckets
from Herman, junior guard Allie Long’
and sophomore guard Meg Ingram
helped the Generals take a 35-32 lead
with a little over 15 minutes to go. But
sloppy play on the part of the Generals
allowed the Marlins to battle right back.

The Generals turned the ball over 20
times in the contest, including a couple
costly mistakes that handed VWC ﬁve
straight points and the lead with two
minutes left. The Generals shot close to
60 percent in the second half, but their
shots weren’t enough to make up for
their turnovers.

Herman and Bolton both tallied 14

points in the game and recorded seven -

and nine rebounds, respectively. Ingram
added 12 points, four assists and three
steals.

Two days later, the team boarded the
bus to Randolph College. The Generals
walked away with a close 53-51 win, but
in the Generals’ eyes the margin should
have been a lot wider.

Randolph has been struggling all
year, sporting only a 3-17 overall re-
cord with a 2-14 mark in conference
play. But the Generals found themselves
down 47-41 with 9:18 to go in the game.
First-year guard Katy Wilson saved
the momentum and the victory for the
Generals. Wilson slashed to the basket
for a lay-up and then stole the ball from
Randolph’s Megan Carney on the next
possession, ﬁnding Ingram down low
for another easy two points.

Just like that, a-quick four points pro-

vided the spark for a 12-4 run to end the
game and give the win to W&L. Ingram

‘scored the last ﬁve points for the Gener-

als and her jumper with 3:15 to go put
the game away. Only one more basket
was scored the rest of the game.

Ingram led the way with a season-
high 21 points. Her game revolves
around the three-point shot and she was
4-8 from downtown against Randolph.
Bolton was held to single-digit scoring
for only the second time this year with
ﬁve points, but she made up for it with
15 rebounds and four steals. Herman
chipped in a solid 11 points and seven
boards.

The sloppy performance in this
week’s game was unexpected and disap-
pointing for the Generals.

“Our last two games were not our
best, and we did not play at our usual
level,” Bolton said. “But we have been
working hard in practice and we are
planning on winning the rest of our
games for this season.”

Herman was also conﬁdent about her
team’s ability to rebound from its slug-
gish play heading into a series of home
games.

“It will be nice to play at home and
we just need to play as one on defense

and offense,” she said. “If we do what
we do best, we will be ﬁne.”

The Generals were set to take on
Lynchburg College this past Friday, but
the game was rescheduled for Sunday
after a winter storm covered campus in a
blanket of snow.

A few extra days of practice might
have been just what the Generals need-
ed. The team rebounded from its slug-
gish play earlier in the week to defeat
Lynchburg 72-68.

The’ Generals committed 19 tum-
overs in the victory, but strong shooting
performances saved the game.

Ingram led the Generals with 17
points and Bolton put up yet another
double-double with 16 points and 10
rebounds.

Sophomore forward Kari Pfannen-
stein added 15 points and Long rounded
out the top scorers for the Generals, put-
ting up 13 points in the victory.

The Generals will keep a home-court
advantage this week, starting with a
match—up against Emory & Henry to-
night. Tip-offis at 7 p.m.

Super Bowl XLIV: All about the timing

Everything fell into place for the New Orleans Saints as they stunned the Indianapolis Colts 31-] 7 in Miami on Sunday

By Adam Cancryn
STAFF WRITER

As it so often is in life, timing was
everything.

The Miami Dolphins were just two
months removed from their 2005-06
campaign, one that was considered a gi-
ant step forward for the franchise. The
team had ﬁnished 9-7, a far cry from
their 4-12 record just a year earlier. Mi-
ami had even capped their turnaround
with a rousing two-point victory over
the New England Patriots in week 17.

The Dolphins’ mastermind was ﬁrst-
year coach Nick Saban. Pried from the
college ranks after ﬁve years at LSU,
Saban was the hottest commodity in
football. And in his ﬁrst year, he had not
disappointed. Spirits were high, and the
pieces seemed in place for a playoff run
in the near future. All Miami needed to
complete its transformation was a quar-
terback.

Luckily, there was not one, but two
all-pro QBs available. The Minnesota
Vikings were shopping the troubled but
immensely talented Daunte Culpepper,
while San Diego Chargers QB Drew
Brees hadpelected to test free agency.
Each had their eyes on Miami.

Saban met with both, and decided
to trade for Culpepper. Brees had the

track record and the desire to be a D01-
phin, but his injury history scared them
off. After having rotator cuff surgery in
the offseason, there were doubts that he

could return to his previou'§ form.

Saban and the Dolphins acquired
Daunte Culpepper on March 14. That
same day, Brees accepted a 6-year,
$60 million deal with the New Orleans
Saints, a franchise whose relocation
rumors made more headlines than the
actual games. For Brees and his Miami
dream job, the timing just wasn’t right.

But sometimes, things just seem to
fall into place. I

The Saints came out of halftime in
Sunday night’s Super Bowl down 10-6.
They had dominated possession in the
second quarter, but had just two ﬁeld
goals to show for it. Now, Peyton Man-
ning and the Indianapolis Colts’ offense
was ready to take the ﬁeld and take back
control.

But instead of conceding the kickoff,
kicker Thomas Morstead booted a low
liner toward the Colts’ front line. The
onside kick caught the Colts off-guard,
and in the ensuing scramble the ball
skittered off the turf and into the hands
of the Saints’ Chris Reis. As abruptly as

possession had changed, so had the mo-
mentum.

Sometimes, good timing is a result of
countless hours of and preparation.

Shortly after signing Brees, the Saints
drafted running back Reggie Bush and
receivers Marques Colston and Devery
Henderson. They vaulted into starting
spots as rookies, developing a rapport
with their quarterback that four years
later enabled Brees to complete 32 of
his 39 pass attempts on Sunday. Relying
on precisely run routes and an unspoken
chemistry, the experienced trio caught
19 of them.

Sometimes, good timing means a
second chance.

Kicker Garrett Hartley caught on
with the Saints in 2008. An undrafted
free agent who had already been cut
once in his short career, he signed with
New Orleans in October and promptly
nailed his ﬁrst 13 ﬁeld goals. Hartley
had a stranglehold on his ﬁrst NFLjob,
until he tested positive for the banned
stimulant Adderall prior to the ‘O9 sea-
son. A four-game suspension relegated
him to the bench, where he sat until an
injury to the starting kicker gave him
a second shot. Hartley responded with

four ﬁeld goals against Washington, in-
cluding an overtime game-winner that
preserved the Saints’ then-perfect sea-
son. Nine weeks later he converted his
third attempt from over 40 yards, setting

the route, secured the ball and took it
on a 74-yard, game clinching, end zone
jaunt.

Four years ago, the Saints’ franchise
history consisted only of wasted oppor-

Becca Bolton’s shooting skills
and team leadership have helped the
Washington and Lee women’s basket-
ball team win 11 games, including 10
ODAC victories, so far this season. The
5’9” guard and forward is averaging 16
points and 11.2 rebounds per game, with
42 assists and 24 steals only 19 games
into the season. She has scored double
digits in every game except for two and
has put up a double-double in seven of
the team’s last nine games. .

As a ﬁrst-year, Bolton started 24
games and produced seven double-dou-
bles with 16 double-digit scoring efforts.
She also averaged 12.4 points per game,
7.7 rebounds per game and accrued 48
steals on the season. She shot 75.6 per-
cent from the foul line and 40.9 percent
from the ﬁeld.

While at Chatham Central High
School, Bolton lettered in basketball
and soccer. In her senior year, she was
captain of both sports, and she played
varsity basketball all four years of high
school. Bolton earned Chatham Cen-

tral’s Athlete of the Year award and the
Conference Player of the Year award, as

well as Most Valuable Player honors in
both basketball and soccer.

Off the court at W&L, Bolton is a
Dean’s List student who is majoring in
biology and environmental studies. She
is a member of the Student Environmen-
tal Action League, the “Compost Crew”
and the College Democrats.

PHI: How did you ﬁnd W&L and
what made you decide to come to here?

BOLTON: I wanted to play basket-
ball and applied to Elon, Richmond,
Guilford, Virginia Tech (not for basket-
ball) and W&L. W&L had the best ac'a-
demics and I had an awesome visit. The
school is so pretty and the basketball

program seemed to ﬁt me well.

PHI: How did your high school
basketball experience at Chatham Cen-
tral inﬂuence your decision to play at
W&L?

BOLTON: Chatham is a small 1A
school, but we had a competitive pro-
gram. My senior year we made it to
the semi-ﬁnals of the state tournament.
That experience helped me to know that
I wanted to play basketball as long as I
could

PHI: What has being a part of the
basketball team added to your experi-
ence at W&L? ‘

BOLTON: It means a lot to me. My
teammates are my closest friends and
the team itself is very important to me.
Without basketball, W&L would not be
the same.

PHI: What off-season preparation, or
in-season experience, has made such a

young team united enough to perform so.

well this season? ,
BOLTON: The freshmen came in
well this year and ready to play. The

t

freshmen are getting playing time and
are learning how to play a higher level
of basketball. They are getting more vo-
cal and that is helping our team. Also,
our trip to San Diego brought the team
together greatly.

PHI: What is your most memorable
moment, or game, since playing for the
Generals?

BOLTON: Last year, when the team
was not doing so well, we were playing
at Emory & Henry. Former senior guard
Bethany Ridenhour scored a game-
changing jump-shot to give us the lead
and eventually the victory.

» PHI: What‘ do you think made you so
successful this season? '

BOLTON: I am a year older and more
mature on the court. I don’t worry about
missing shots or making a bad pass and
that has made me more conﬁdent during
the games. If my shot is not falling one
game, I am able to focus on assists and
rebounds, which has helped me and the
team a lot.

Win-streak snapped

The Generals defeated Emory & Henry, but fell to Randolph-Macon

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

A strong surge in the second halfsurge
gave the Washington and Lee men’s bas-
ketball team their third win in a row against
Emory & Henry College on Wednesday,
but the Generals couldn’t rally to defeat
Ranolph-Macon College last night. The
Generals kept Emory & Henry College
winless in the Old Dominion Athletic
Conference with a 77-58 victory over the
Wasps, but fell 56-53 to Randolph-Macon.
The Generals are now 13-7 overall and 5-
6 in ODAC conference play.

One of the major differences during

the three-game streak was winning the

turnover battle, said senior forward Zac‘

White.
“Tumovers have deﬁnitely been the

A key- both committed and forced,” said

White. “We”ve cut our turnovers to about
10 per game, while forcing our opponents
into 17 in each ofthe last three games.”

The Generals forced 17 turnovers-in
the game against E&H and gave away
only 11. But despite the lopsided turnover
margin, the Wasps managed to keep the
game close in the ﬁrst half.

W&L won the opening tip, and senior
forward Ben Goetsch immediately capi-
talized with a reverse layup. Goetsch went
on to score the team’s next two points on
another layup. Both teams then went cold
and the score was knotted at 7-7 with near-
ly 13 minutes remaining in the ﬁrst half.

The Generals attempted to break away
from the Wasps after an 11-2 run put the
team up 23-12 with 5:55 to go. But E&H
responded right away with a 15-5 run of
its own to cut the lead to 3. W&L led 28-
25 at the half.

But the second half was a different
story. The Generals overcame their shoot-
ing woes and began to take control ofthe
game.

nailed a jumper in the lane to start the
scoring off. White then connected on a
three from the top of the arc, and Goetsch
banked in a layup after grabbing an offen-
sive rebound. The team ignited on a 7-0
run and, just 90 seconds into the second
half, the score was 35-25.

Coach Adam Hutchinson said defense
was the reason for the strong start to the
second half. , ‘

“It started on the defensive end,” said
Coach Hutchinson. “We held them to a
very low ﬁeld-goal percentage and were
able to run the ﬂoor and get some easy
buckets. Our shooting also generally im-

proves when we limit our turnovers.”

W&L continued its momentum after
an E&H bucket and went on a 17-4 run,
which included nine points by Adkins to
advance the score to 52-31. The Generals
did not look back, but they maintained a
double-digit lead for the rest of the game.
Some ofthe highlights included an alley-
oop layup by sophomore guard Jon Guest
off ofa feed from Adkins who was behind
the three-point line. Senior forward An-
drew Payne also got into the act by sinking
a left-handed hook shot while drawing the
foul. W&L scored 49 points in the second
half to make the ﬁnal score 77-58.

In the contest, the Generals had four
scorers in double ﬁgures—Goetsch (14),
White (14), Adkins (11) and junior guard
Jason Cimino added in 10. Payne and ﬁrst-
year Hans Harris chipped in by combining
for 17 off of the bench.

“The scoring balance has to do with
being aggressive on offense,” said White.
“People are ﬁnding themselves in posi-
tions that are best for them and seizing op-
portunities more than ever.”

W&L was scheduled to face No. 1-
ranked Guilford College over the weekend,
but the game was postponed to February
15 because of poor weather conditions.

But lingering snow didn’t keep Ran-
dolph-Macon away from the ODAC game
last night.

The last time the Generals played the
Yellow Jackets, they earned their ﬁrst win
in Randolph-Macor1’s gym since the 1958-
1959 season. But the Generals couldn’t
pull off the win on their home court and
Randolph-Ma'con defeated W&L 56-53.

Adkins lead the Generals with 15
points and five rebounds. Goetsch added
13 points and ﬁve rebounds.
