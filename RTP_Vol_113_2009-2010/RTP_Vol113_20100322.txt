Forced break-

in at Palace
Students robbed of $4, 000

worth of electronics

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

An off-campus student house, “Pink Palace,” was
robbed of nearly $4,000 worth of electronics last
weekend when its occupants, three Washington and
Lee juniors, were away at their fraternity formal.

Sometime between 4:30 pm. on Saturday, March
13 and 4:00 a.m. on Sunday, March 14, a forced

. break-in occurred at the 2851 Collierstown Road
residence. All of the house’s occupants had departed
that Saturday afternoon for the Phi Delta Theta fonnal.
Prior to their departure, the students locked their house,
according to house occupant Wit Robertson.

Aﬁer the formal, resident Andy Merlino returned to
the house around 4:00 a.m. and didn’t notice anything
suspicious, because he immediately went to bed. The
following day, Robertson, who had spent the night in
town, received a phone call from Merlino who said
the house had been severely robbed.

Robertson and Jason Cimino, the house’s third
occupant, returned to the house immediately and

“Things like this happen in the
world every day, and we ‘re
hoping we can bring these thieves

to justice. ”

JASON CIMINO, junior
 

noticed a muddy footprint on the lower half of their
front door, indicating that the break-in was forced.
The students reported the following missing items
from their one—story home: two televisions, a laptop,
a desktop computer, two jackets, an internet router, a
wireless cell tower, two X-Box Consoles, four X-Box
controllers, and several DVDS and video games.

Robertson reported that his dresser drawers had
been pulled out and his clothes covered his floor. The
robber had also broken a golf club and the binding of
R0bertson’s snowboard during the ravage.

Since the break-in, the W&L students have been
in contact with the Rockbridge County Sheriff’s
Department, where officers are still investigating
who is responsible for the forced entry. The students
provided several serial numbers for their missing
items, with the hopes of seeing their goods again
someday at a registered pawn shop.

According to Robertson, the students have never
had any reported problems with their surrounding
neighbors. The only incident was last fall, when the
current occupants received a letter from a student and
the principal from Effinger Elementary School, located
just north of the house. The school was frustrated that
the Pink Palace inhabitants had left trash in their yard
for more than a single day. Beyond the good relations
that the students have with their neighbors, the students
are also communicative with their landlord, Charlie
Potter.

Potter has been the landlord for Pink Palace and
three other country homes inhabited by W&L students
since 1990: “Lazy River,” “the Mill” and “Cedar
Creek.” Immediately following the incident, Potter
changed the locks and provided the residents with new
keys at all four of the homes.

According to Robertson, other W&L students who
live off campus, especially in the country, should lock
their doors and windows while sleeping or are away
from their house. For months now the “Pink Palace”
occupants have gone to great extents to conserve
power by turning their lights off when possible. Now,
however, the students will make a conscious effort to
always keep a light on.

Potter said that in his nearly 21 years as landlord,
nothing like this has ever happened in his homes
before, but he associates this incident with today’s
tight economic times.

“I think it was just luck probably, since times are
uncertain and people are out of jobs,” said Potter.

He also cautioned students to be wary, no matter
where they live. “It can happen in the city just as well
as in the country.”

Although frustrated and dismayed by the forced
entry, Cimino agreed with Potter. “Things like this
happen in the world every day, and we’re hoping we
can bring these thieves to justice,” he said.

To get to W&L! EC hopes to bring Chick-ﬁl-A to campus as a new dining option

A By Paige Gance

STAFF WRITER

The Executive Committee has
been working to bring Chick-Fil-A
to campus since the beginning of fall
term, and students might be able to
“Eat mor chikin” by the end of this
year

The plan is not a sure thing, and
the EC plans to release a survey in the
next few weeks in order to measure
student preference.

Ultimately, said Eric Hoffman, EC
president, it comes down to “what the
students want.”

The idea to bring in the restaurant
first came to the EC when a friend at
the University ofNort_h Carolina told
Hoffman about how the fast food
chain comes in once a week to cook
and serve chicken sandwiches to UNC
students.

Given the lack of an affordable
variety of restaurants in town and
limited dining options on campus,
Hoffman said he feels this would be a
welcome addition to the current meal
selection.

The restaurant originated in the
South but has since spread nationwide.
Some W&L students like it so much
they drive all the way to Roanoke
for a meal.

Since the Roanoke establishment is
the closest one to Lexington, the EC,
along with the director of auxiliary
services, Alex de Silva, have worked
with that restaurant extensively on
this project.

Chick-ﬁl-A representatives have

already come and inspected the
cooking facilities on campus and
determined that, without additional
equipment, the food cannot be
prepared in the Marketplace or C0-
op. The idea of transporting the food
to campus from Roanoke was deemed
unsuitable due to the narrow window
of time that the food would still be
ﬁt to eat.

Currently, the plan would be to
prepare the food in Evans Dining Hall
and then serve it in places like the Co-
op and Law School Brief Stop. Chick-

If Chick-fil-A does come to
campus and if it is successful, there
could be a permanent establishment
on or near campus, although available
space is an issue. At the moment, the
university’s focus is on opening the
Hillel bagel shop.

Such future projections might
be “premature” at this point, said
de Silva, who is in charge of dining
services.

“There is a common commitment
to evaluate the possible options of
introducing a ‘brand’ within the

“[Chick-ﬁl-A] would encourage people to eat

on campus instead of the sorority or fraternity

houses. ”

ERIC HOFFMAN, EC president

ﬁl-A, however, would have to provide
addition equipment in order to adhere
to its strict preparation standards.

There are still “lots of hurdles,”
said Hoffman, but he said he is
“optimistic” about the chances of
Chick-ﬁl-A coming to campus.

He also said he would like to see
it served “at least once a semester.”
Ideally, it would be served every
month or even every week.

mix of existing dining venues,” said
de Silva. The results of the student
survey will “certify the campus desire
towards this brand or point us in a
different direction.”

Scott Centorino, current EC vice
president and a candidate for EC
president, is conﬁdent about bringing
in Chick-ﬁl-A.

One of the ten commitments he
says he will pursue if elected states,

‘‘I will work to ﬁnish this EC’s goal
of bringing Chick-ﬁl-A to campus,
which is within reach.”

Along with tasty food and more
variety, current EC president Hoﬁinan
said he believes Chick-ﬁl-A could
beneﬁt the student body in certain
indirect ways.

Besides being “one of the healthiest
fast food restaurants,” its popularity
could increase the appeal of W&L
from an admissions standpoint, he
said.

Furthermore, its presence “would
encourage people to eat on campus
instead of the sorority or fraternity
houses," said Hoffman. One of the
EC’s aims has been to promote more
interaction between all members of
the student community.

While the details of the plan are
subject to change, Chick-ﬁl-A is still
interested in the idea as of now, but
this is not set in stone either.

If the plan is implemented,
Hoffman said the cost of a meal
will probably be covered by food
ﬁex. Now don’t you wish you hadn’t
used up all your funds on Sunrise
sandwiches?

Group will SPEAK up  

Sexual assault awareness group to sponsor a week-long campaign of education

By Killeen King
STAFF WRITER

SPEAK will be sponsoring their
new initiative SPEAK Week next
week in an effort to bring the entire
campus into their ﬁght against sexual
assault.

SPEAK is an organization that
educates women about sexual assault
on campus, supports survivors of
sexual assault and empowers women
to rally against sexual assault on
campus, according to SPEAK’s
president Taylor Hart. It hopes to
promote discussion of sexual assault
through the events of SPEAK Week.

“SPEAK Week will have a
diverse array of events and initiatives
that should help members of our
community look at the issue of sexual
assault from different perspectives,”
said Hart.

These events include: the Snap!
Bracelet campaign, a sexual assault
forum, a performance by the group
Sex Signals, the Take Back the Night
Rally and Denim Day.

This is the fourth year that
SPEAK has done the Snap! Bracelet
campaign, but this year it is taking a
new approach, according to Hart. “We
wanted to make this campaign more
gender-neutral, because it is critical
that the entire campus get involved
Ait cannot simply be a women’s

issue,” said Hart. The bracelets say,
“I support W&L women” and will
be available various places around
campus, including the Commons and
the library.

Two Washington and Lee staff
members will moderate the sexual
assault forum and there will be a
six-to-eight person panel consisting

much denim as possible, in light ofa
court case in which ajudge told a rape
victim that she could not have been
raped~due to the fact that herjeans
were too tight to remove,” said Hart.
The week will end on Thursday,
April 1 with the Take Back the Night
Rally, which is headed by senior
SPEAK member Katie Sinks.

“It is critical that the entire campus get

involvea’—it cannot simply be a women 3

of both men and women, Hart said.
SPEAK will place boxes around
campus for people to submit panel
discussion questions and topics.

Sex Signals, which is sponsored
by SPEAK, Contact, 1-in-4, IFC,
Panhellenic and several fraternities,
will perform on Wednesday. This
interactive series is meant to engage
the audience in sexual assault
discussions said Hart.

For Denim Day, SPEAK
encourages students to “wear as

“It is a rally, but in my opinion [it
is] more ofa vigil that allows people
to share their stories and thoughts
on sexual assault and misconduct,”
explained Sinks. “I think it can be a
profound and sobering experience.”

Each year, a sexual assault victim
gives an account of her experience at
the rally. Each year brings in more
attendees than the last, and SPEAK
members hope that this year will
continue the trend.

“I think the most empowering part

ofthe week is the fact that we will be
hosting such a variety of activities,”
Sinks said. Even by participating in
one singular event you are standing
up for and recognizing a worthwhile
cause.”

“its a very clever way ofbringing
the community together across a
series of events,” concluded Sinks.

SPEAK accepts new members
each year through an application
and interview process, which begins
during SPEAK Week. SPEAK
will have information about the
organization and applications at its
table in the Commons on Monday,
Mar. 29.

What should we do about Israel?

Should U.S. foreign policy continue to support Israel in its conquest of the West Bank? Jarrett Brotzman weighs in.

By Jarrett Brotzman
CO L U M N I ST

These past two weeks have
put great stress on the relation-
ship between lsrael and the Unit-
ed States.

Last week, the United States,
through the actions and words of
Vice President Biden. gave Israel
a sharp rebuke for its aggressive
expansion of settlements in the
West Bank.

According to the Financial
Times, Biden accused Israel of
“inflaming tensions“ in the re-
gion, and strongly urged Israel
not to prejudice the outcome of
the forthcoming peace talks be—
tween Palestine and Israel.

These new developments
between Israel and the US. are
interesting, considering that the
U.S. has traditionally shown un-
bounded support for Israel.

Since Israel became a country
after WWII, the United States
has provided the Israeli military
forces with weapons and train-
ing, and backed the country with
a strong showing of political
capital in various international
organizations.

Israel has been the largest
recipient of both economic and
military assistance out of any
nation in the world since 1947
(U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel, U.S.
CRS). Between 2001 and 2007
alone, the U.S. gave Israel al-
most $20 billion in foreign mili-
tary ﬁnancing.

In addition to providing mili-
tary goods to Israel, the United
States serves as the largest trad-
ing partner for Israeli goods and
services, accounting for a full
32.5 percent of exports. This
relationship is also highly ben-
eﬁcial for some industries in the
United States. Almost I2 percent
of Israeli imports from the U.S.
is comprised of military goods,
grain and consumer goods (CIA
World Factbook, 2009).

However, a ramping up of
political rhetoric by the Obama
administration, most recently by
Vice President Biden claiming
that “both sides will be held ac-
countable for any statements of
actions that inﬂame tension,” has
caused many to wonder ifthis re-

lationship is going to remain as
strong as it has in the past.

The implications of deteriora-
tion in any relationship, political
or economic, have vast implica-
tions in the international realm.
Israel has served as a strong mili-
tary partner in the region, and has

America’s relationship with Isra-
el throughout history. They fear
that this alliance give justiﬁca-
tion for other nations and groups
in the Middle East to attack and
align against the United States,
when perhaps they wouldn’t
have done so otherwise.

Recent language from Vice President

administration is considering a change

in policy.

acted as a counterweight to the
overwhelmingly Arab nations’
interests in the Middle East.

Perhaps a continued alliance
in its current form is no longer
in the best interests of the United
States.

Some groups have opposed

One signiﬁcant example to
which these critics point is the
U.S. “Operation Nickel Grass,”
a resupply mission to Israel dur-
ing the Yom Kippur War that led
to the 1973 oil embargo by the
Arab states in OPEC.

Critics also say that Israel’s

use of U.S. weapons in the 1982
and 2006 offensives against
Lebanon only serve to fuel anti-
American sentiment in the re-
gion.

The questions before the
Obama administration are
whether or the U.S. ‘should con-
tinue its military and economic
aid to Israel, and whether or not
any aid should come with spe-
ciﬁc stipulations on activities in
the West Bank and surrounding
regions.

Recent language from Vice
President Biden seems to indi-
cate that the current administra-
tion is considering a change in
policy.

Perhaps the recent change in
tone is an indication of future
policy. If one day the U.S. ceases
to support Israel as it does now,
two distinct—though not mutu-
ally exclusive—scenarios may
follow.

The ﬁrst is that many Arab
nations would tone down their
anti-American sentiment, and
there would be more room for

safe interaction with other Arab
states as we pull support from
Israel.

However, the U.S. would also
risk giving up signiﬁcant terri-
tory and influence in the Middle
East. A change in policy could
have the opposite effect, and fur-
ther encourage separatist groups,
who may claim their terrorist
techniques drove U.S. forces out
of the region.

Either way, the US. could
face a serious loss ofinﬂuence in
the region, regardless of what the
Obama administration chooses
to do.

Peace talks are always a good
start, but I feel that there will be
little concrete progress between
Israel and Palestine while we re-
main in the region.

Camping against the threats of nature

Thoughts on camping, global warming and, most importantly, bears

By Hal Bozarth
COLUMNIST

It’s nearly spring, and our
lovely Lexington weather is co-
operating with the calendar.

The sun is shining, the snow
is gone and the leaves are start-
ing to grow. Add our geography
and our community’s youth, and
this onset of the warmer months
can only mean one thing: Camp-
ing.

For most, it’s about living the
simple life, relaxing and getting
away from the pressures of the
modern world by zipping your-
self into a restrictive polythene
greenhouse full of farts and un-
washed feet. Yes, for many, it’s
about being at one with nature.
Well, not for me.

For me, camping is about be-
ing at war with nature. Shut it,
songbirds.

Be under no illusions: Mother
Nature is out to get you. As soon
as you’ve unpacked the Jeep, she
sends her minions: legions of
soldier ants, winged air support
from wasps the size of men’s
ﬁsts, badgers that can take your
leg clean off and the all-conquer-
ing, plan-ruining drizzle.

When I go camping, I like to
do it properly. Items not for me
include the self-erecting pop-up
tent, the inﬂatable mattress and
the down-feathered sleeping bag
with duvet. Those are for sis-
sies and the na'I've.vIt’s a jungle
out there, so I always pack the
essentials: blowtorch, machete
and enough bear traps to create a
half-mile perimeter.

It is said that the best way to
escape from a charging bear is to
take off your clothes, article by
article, and place them on the
ground. In theory, the bear will
stop to smell each item, giving
you a window through which to
escape.

The cost of running away
from the campsite naked is leav-
ing yourself defenseless, lost,
naked and, as a consequence of
your nakedness, alone. (Unless,
of course, you are a woman—in
which case your male compan-
ions will have thrown caution to
the wind in an attempt to keep

giving his grandchildren Lyme
disease.

News from the front is good,
though. The evidence is abun-
dant: we are winning this war
against nature. Greenpeace and
its ilk tell us that a chunk of
rainforest the size of Wales is
chopped down every day by a
joint-strike movement coordi-
nated between burger companies
and Nike, both in search of slave
labor driven by doe-eyed Aztec
children. (I thought the Spanish
killed them all off with guns and
syphilis?)

As a result of this deforesta-

Yes, for many, [camping is] about being

at one with nature. Well, not for me. For

me, camping is about being at war with

nature. Shut it, songbirds.

you in their sights.) I disagree
with this advice: surely the best
way to avoid being eaten by
bears is to shoot them in the mid-
dle of the face.

Children bemoan the appar-
ent murder of Bambi’s mother.
Better she went out with a bang
than to have run headlong into a
speeding truck in an attempt to
cross the road and lick a salty
retiree to death while simultane-
ously destroying his patio and

tion, combined with our massive
automobiles running rampant
over the once-untamed frontiers
of North America, the globe is
warming.

If humankind loves one thing,
it’s warmth: for example, there
are millions more people living
in Egypt than in Sweden. The
deserts of Tijuana and Los Ange-
les are packed to the brim, while
chilly Alaska remains virtually
barren. Mexico and Brazil have

given us Tapas and the thong,
respectively. The Norwegians,
meanwhile, are given two op-
tions at birth: freeze to death or
kill yourself at age thirty—two.

If we do overdo the whole
warming bit, I’m not worried:
we here in Virginia canjust sit on
our mountains and laugh as the
guidos drown in the ever-sink-
ing Jersey Shore, and Washing-
ton, D.C., once again becomes a
swamp—not that Congress isn’t
already stuck in a quagmire.

For me, camping is about
coming face-to-face with the wild
beast that is the outdoors, blind-
ing it with tear gas, wrestling it
manfully to the forest ﬂoor and
then kicking it in the side with
steel-toed boots that were sent
halfway across the planet by a
massive Chinese barge.

We climbed our way out of
the primordial sludge to the top
of the tree, and now we’ve got
gadgets, baby. My GPS is so
powerful, I can see me looking at
me inside my tent. So look out:
here comes ol’ two-legs again
with his SUV that runs on pure
Agent Orange.

They say there’s a fine line
between camping and sleeping
rough on the floor. There is. It’s
called a guy rope, and mine is
made out of electriﬁed zin'c-gal-
vanized steel wire. So come on,
Mother Nature: here I am. It‘s
just you and me. Come and have
a go, if you think you’re man
enough.

Televison networks are streamling their program choices

Thanks to Fox News and MSNB C, over the past decade

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

A funny thing has been hap-
pening in network television
over the past couple of years.
Back in the old days, that is from
1997 to 2003~—were there even
networks before then‘? It doesn’t
matter——each network had its
own distinctive style and ﬂavor.
While watching a show, you
could tell from what network it
came.

Take “Boy Meets World” for
example; that show was manipu-
lated by ABC executives to bet-
ter ﬁt into their “TGIF” lineup
that was directed at the tweens
watching the show. The plot
lines were relatively simplistic
and the characters, especially
Cory’s parents and Mr. Feeney,
were reﬁned to reﬁect the pro-
posed values of the Disney Cor-
poration and its partners.

However, even though “Boy
Meets World” was as emblem-
atic of ABC in the late nine-
ties as “Dhanna and Greg,” the
show still could have survived
on another network. It would’ve
looked‘ different, yes, but not
drastically different.

These days, “Boy Meets
World” would never survive
anywhere else. The shows on
each network are getting increas-
ingly identical to each other. The
dramas on CBS are much more
like CBS sitcoms, instead of re-
sembling dramas on other net-
works. Network executives are
narrowing their focus to certain
demographics, and are less and
less likely to take any risks what-
soever when it comes to shows.

How did this start? Depend-

ing on your political afﬁliation,
you can thank either Fox News
or MSNBC. When Fox wanted
to start a news network in the
1990s, Newscorp chairman Ru-
pert Murdoch hired Republican
strategist Roger Ailes to start
and head the Fox News Channel.
Despite a slogan of being “Fair

, and Balanced,” the network un-

questionably has a Republican
slant to it. .

At the very least, the chan-
nel seems to have a streamlined
thought process when it analyzes
any news it encounters, which
led it to become by far the high-
est-watched news channel in the
United States. CNN, who vehe-
mently avoids any semblance of
opinion, was left in the dust.

Seeing this success, when MS-
NBC moved into 30 Rockefeller
Plaza in 2006, it decided to take
on a deﬁnitively liberal-sounding
point of view in response. While
it has not seen anywhere close
to the same viewership success
as Fox News, MSNBC still has
found better numbers with a sin-
gular, channel-driven outlook,
instead of simply presenting the
news.

Network executives saw the
success that a singular mindset
had for news channels, and ap-
plied it to their networks. They
found that by cemtering all
their primetime shows around
a certain idea or perception that
people have of themselves, they
could maximize their ratings and
proﬁts. By doing this, network
shows are now carefully crafted
to better resemble their net-

totheecilior

works’ respective ideals. Now,
obviously this has happened
in media since the beginning
of time, but since the advent of
Fox News and MSNBC, every
minute detail of each television
show has been manipulated to ﬁt
the program. And it’s been only
getting worse.

In 1999, Judd Apatow had a
show about high school fresh-
men green-lit by NBC. Then in

dience. I’m sure my professors
will appreciate my dedication to
such noble investigatory tech-
niques.

If you are a typical CBS
viewer, you are one of three de-
mographics that funnily enough
have a lot in common. You are

I either old, boring or without a

signiﬁcant interest in television.
The plotlines for CBS’ eve-
ning programming are conven-

The dramas on CBS are much more
like CBS sitcoms, instead of

ressembling dramas on other networks

 

2002, he had a show about col-
lege freshmen green-lit by Fox.
At the time, this was normal TV
business. Nowadays, this could
never happen. '

This is not necessarily an evil
invention. This trend is simply
either the further evolution of the
television industry or a fad that
will die out eventually. Either
way, it seems more natural than
either good or bad.

But who are these speciﬁc
demographics that each network
are trying to market towards?
And do you ﬁt into any of the
networks’ categories? Well,
luckily for you, I’ve completely
avoided homework altogether
this week just so I could get a
proper understanding of exactly
these networks think is their au-

tional and about as innovative
as Tiger’s choice in women to
sleep with. Shows like “How
I Met Your Mother” and “The
Big Bang Theory” started out
as original sitcoms that could
go in directions that TV had
never gone before. Instead, CBS
streamlined them into “Two and
a Half Men” look-a-likes that
lack any original character arcs
or plotlines. “The Mentalist” is
simply a conglomeration of dra-
mas that have repeated predict-
able outcomes. Why does CBS
do this? Because, as the leading
network in the US, its minimal
risk strategy appeals to the ma-
jority of Americans who watch
television so they don’t have to
think. It may not be interesting,
but it works.

Fox chose to go with a strategy
that puts as much action into one
network as possible. Whatever
kind of show you are watching
on Fox, there is the maximum of
it in that hour. Fox not only is the
league leader in explosions for a
network (think about “24” and
“Human Target”), but Fox also
keeps “American Idol” action-
packed with singer after singer
and tons of judges and guests.
Even with comedies like “Fam-
ily Guy” and “The Simpsons,”
there is nothing reserved about
the humor.'

Basically, everything Fox
does is shamelessly overt. I mean,
with the exception of looking up
an obscure disease on “House,”
have you ever had to Wikipedia
anything while watching Fox?

ABC has made the interest-
ing decision to give preference
to shows that only serve obses-
sive fan bases. They took the
exact opposite marketing strat-
egy from CBS. Instead of hav-
ing tons of non-interested view-
ers, ABC broadcasts programs
which are marketed towards the

fewer viewers who are intensely V

dedicated to their shows.

The network of obsession
has turned “Lost,” “Desperate
Housewives” and “Gray’s Anat-
omy” into cult phenomenons.
Look at “Lost.” There is not a
single person who could casu-
ally pick up “Lost” this season.
ABC has consciously marketed
a show that can only lose view-
ers from week to week and not
gain any. However, ABC knows
this and is hoping that everyone

networks have broadcasted less orginalprimetime shows

is talking about “Lost” the next
day, instead of “Two and a Half
Men.” ABC’s promotion of tele-
vision obsession is behind their
pickup of “Scrubs,” and their
development of “V” and “Flash
Forward.”

Lastly, if you are watching
NBC you want to feel intellectu-
ally superior to those around you.
If you watch NBC, you may or
may not be an intelligent person,
but the most important factor
in your television life is the se-
curity you feel from perceiving
yourself as smarter than the rest
of America. This strategy came
directly from MSNBC and more
speciﬁcally Keith Olberrnann,
who probably should’ve stuck
to “SportsCenter.” I fall into this
category, so I can speak about it
freely. NBC’s comedies all fo-
cus on smart, snarky characters
looking directly at the camera,
acknowledging the absurdity of
the situation, and somehow plac-
ing themselves above it. In other
words, this is the Paul Rudd net-
work. Even “The Marriage Ref”
follows the same kind of come-
dic plan.

So what should ,you take
away from these networks’ strat-
egies to ﬁt you into any of these
four categories? You could con-
scientiously acknowledge the
manipulation while still enjoying
the broadcasted shows, but that
takes a lot of effort. My advice:

‘ Screw it. Just watch cable.

‘The administration’ is not about policing students

Dean_ Watkins responds to opinion articles that criticize the school ’s administration for its party and drug philosophy

I write in response to the two
articles on the Opinion page of
the March 15 Ring-tum Phi,
“Tweaking and perfecting drug
discipline at W&L,” and “Off-
campus parties not safe.”

Both writers challenge “the
administration” to change stu-

\ dent conduct. Washington and

Lee has always prided itself on
the principle of student self-gov-
emance. Students are expected
to behave honorablyand to hold
their fellow students to this same
standard of conduct. When they
fail in ‘this, they are subject to
policies that govern student con-
duct.

But the University’s admin-
istration is not the police or the
FBI or the DEA. We are an edu-
cational institution; we are edu-
cators. Working with students,
we set standards consistent with

the mission of the institution
and ask students to live by those
standards.

No one is trying to hide
from reality. Quite the contrary,
the reality is that is that some-
times individual students make
individual choices when they
choose risky, often illegal be-
haviors—such as using illegal

drugs, engaging in sexual inter-

course without consent or driv-
ing while intoxicated. Students
need to reﬁect on their actions,
their peers’ actions, the values of
the University and what we can
all do to uphold those values—
individually as well as holding
peers accountable when they fall
short.

To suggest that the adminis-
tration has a goal of pushing par-
ties off campus could not be fur-
ther from the truth. At the same

that we are not the police and we

not be—to bring cases before the

goal is to reinforce an environ-
ment where our students are
making better choices, by re-

warding those who make the bet-

sometimes through removal from
the institution, who are not. And
our role never should be to wield
the Honor System as a sword.
Ultimately,'that undermines our
entire Honor System.

What we, as the “administra-

is for individual students to ac-

While both writers are ‘criti-
cal of decisions made by some
of their peers (and should be
critical of such decision mak-

ing), what’s important to note is
that the majority of our students
make good choices. So, when
a W&L student knows another
student is NOT making the bet-
ter choice then, following a stu-
dent self-govemance model, he
or she should step in and help the
student who is struggling so it’s
not the EC or the SJC (or the po-
lice or the FBI or the DEA) who
has to address the poor decision-
making.

‘Spectacular, spectacular!’ FD ’1O

This weekend, students and staff will put on their gowns and tuxedos for Fancy Dress. The theme? “Moulin Rouge”

By Melissa Powell
STAFF WRITER

This weekend W&L students
will be celebrating a tradition that
began 103 years ago.

Fancy Dress Ball, an event
started by a university librarian
in 1907, has continued to provide
students with a classy, elegant and
fun evening.

And classy is exactly what
Fancy Dress Co-Chair Katie
Geddes wanted the ball to be
this year. After the dark and
serious theme of last year’s
event, Geddes said the committee
wanted something a little more
light-hearted. ‘

Moulin Rouge: the infamous
Parisian cabaret built in 1889 that
was the birthplace of the can-can
dance. It may be better known
as the 2001 film starring Nicole
Kidman and Ewan McGregor.
Either way, this year’s theme

draws on inspirations from the
recognizable windmill-shaped
Paris nightclub that is covered in
lights and draped with red satin.

Geddes said the Moulin Rouge
theme won by “light-years” when
the committee voted, and everyone
who has been involved is anxious
to see the results.

‘‘I’m really excited to see the
committee’s hard work combined
with our production company’s
lighting and effects,” Geddes said.
“The decorations are even better
than last year’s.” .

The selection process for the
theme started at the beginning
of the school year when students
interviewed for the committee.
Each interviewee was required
to list and describe three possible
themes. Geddes and Co-Chair
Kenneth Hopkins then compiled

all of the possible themes to
present to the students who were
picked to be on the committee.

The committee narrowed
the themes down to 10, then
to five. Committee members
formed groups to present on
each remaining theme, giving
PowerPoint presentations to
highlight possible ideas for
construction and decorations.
This year, Geddes and Hopkins
got the production company
Stage Sound to give feedback
on how feasible the ideas were
for each theme. Once the entire
committee voted, Moulin Rouge
won “hands-down,” according to
Geddes.

Committee members have
been sperlfding the last four
weeks in the Pavilion working
on construction and decorations

for the big night. And although
the majority of the work is already
ﬁnished, the committee still has to
move everything into the gym and
begin set-up.

The committee also had to
secure two musical performers
for the ball. This year’s band,
Trademark, will be performing
in the big gym. Trademark, a

i group from Richmond, is made

up of three vocalists and four
instrumentalists. It specializes in
Motown, contemporary, beach,
jazz and R&B music.

“We chose them because they
encompass all music,” Geddes
said. “This way, everyone has
something that they can dance
to.”

D] Ryan will be performing in
the small gym.

The FD committee received

$8,000 from the Executive
Committee this year, but $6,000
of it went to paying off debts from
last year’s ball. Geddes said the
committee will not go into debt
this year, and plans to keep the
budget under $70,000.

The committee gets most of
its budget from ticket sales, but
it also received donations from
the General Activities Board and
Mock Convention.

Fancy Dress will be held this
Saturday from 9 p.m. to l a.m.
in the Doremus Gymnasium. As
always, the event is black tie.

Tickets will be on sale all
week, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the
Elrod Commons and at the Law
School. A full package, which
includes two tickets, two T-shirts
and all of the memorabilia is
$140. Students can also purchase

a half package for $70, individual
tickets for $55 each, individual T-
shirts for $15 each or individual
memorabilia that ranges from $3
to $6.

The committee invested in
a new ticket system this year.
Each ticket is printed, a receipt
is e-mailed to the purchaser and
the ticket must be presented at
the door to be scanned. Tickets
may also be purchased at the door
for $55.

Invitations have been mailed
to all students, faculty and staff
that provides the date, location
and time of the event.

1-W&L debut of
‘Porgy and Bess’

American masterpiece comes to Keller

By Randi Wilson
STAFF WRITER

A 75th anniversary production
of Gershwin’s opera “Porgy and
Bess” is coming to Washington
and Lee tonight and tomorrow
night.

Theatre Director Rob Mish
calls this a “phenomenal”
opportunity.

“It’s a big deal,” he said.

The tour company, led by opera
impresario Michael Capasso,
is bringing two trailers full of
scenery, a 30-member cast, a
l5-piece orchestra and several
crewmembers to perform these
two shows in the Keller Theater,
Mish said.

A production as large as “Porgy
and Bess” is typically performed
at a 1,200 to 1,500-seat theater.
The Keller Theater can only hold
about 400 people.

Mish says that this promises
to be a “very intimate” and “rare”
experience for both thepeople of
Lexington and W&L. However,
Mish hopes that for “something
this important,” that W&L
students ﬁll most of the seats.

“Porgy and Bess” was the ﬁrst
American opera and is written
for and performed by an almost
entirely African—American cast,
as per George Gershwin’s original
dream.

Tim Gaylard, the professor
of music who is considered to
be W&L’s expert on everything
Gershwin, said he believes
Gershwin’s cast choice was very
much a political one.‘

Gershwin discovered the play
“Porgy,” adapted from the novel
by DuBose Heyward, in New
York in 1930, and was inspired to
create an opera from it. He moved
to a segregated African-American
community in Charleston, S.C.,
called a “gullah,” Gaylard said,
in order to research traditional
African music and life. Because
gullahs were segregated, they
were able to better preserve the
rhythms, music, spirituals and
dances in the African tradition.

It took two years to perfect
the authentic feel Gershwin was

looking for. While it still has a
Gershwin sound and a Broadway
quality to it, “Porgy and Bess”
remains distinctive from other
works like it. For instance, the
operatic version has all of the
dialogue sung in what is known
as a recitative style. But there is
a striking difference in that the
only characters that don’t sing are
whites with minor roles.

Gershwin refused to have
his opera sung by anyone other
than an all-black cast, Gaylard
said. While it was common in
the l930s to perform African
plays in the minstrel tradition,
where actors paint their faces
‘and bodies, Gershwin feared this
would stereotype the people he
was seeking to embody. lt was
for this reason that “Porgy and
Bess” was not premiered at the
Metropolitan Opera in New York
until 1985.

According to Mish, diversity
was “absolutely” a reason in
deciding to bring “Porgy and
Bess” to W&L.

But politics were by far not the
only reason.

Gershwin was very empathetic
in telling the “human story” of
“Porgy and Bess,” Gaylard said.
lt’s a touching, tragic tale about
a crippled beggar named Porgy
who falls in love with Bess, a
prostitute who is abused by her
former lover, Crown.

The music is also excellent.
Gaylard describes it as
“syncopated, energetic and‘
interesting,” like much of the
jazz music Gershwin has created.
It’s so technically diﬂicult that the
actors who play Porgy and Bess
will be different each night.

“Porgy and Bess” has been
sold out for a week, but for those
attending, enjoy what Gaylard
and many others have hailed as an
“American masterpiece.”

one dollar, I think we would have
considered it a success,” said
Kelli Jarrell, sophomore co-chair
for next week’s cook-off. “We
hope this year’s event will be even
more successful!”

In addition to ticket sales and
entry fees, Chi 0 plans to sell T-
shirts to further raise money for the
charity. The entire sorority, split
into four committees, has worked
to put together a successful event.
From decorations to marketing
and advertisements to T-shirt
designing and involving the

Lexington community,» all of
the sisters have made an effort
to help grant a sick child his or
her wish.

The Make-a-Wish Foundation
raises money to grant a “wish”
for children with life—threatening
diseases. A child’s wish can span
anything from trips to makeovers
to meeting celebrities. The
Foundation truly tries to give
the children whatever they desire
and provides a very personal
experience for each child. These
“wishes” are the bright spots

in their otherwise very difﬁcult
lives.

“This is important to Chi
Omega because Make-a-Wish is
enriching these children’s lives
and experiences and giving them
opportunities that they would
otherwise never have access to,”
Jarrell said.

Teams are encouraged to sign
up to compete for the title of “Best
Chili.” The judges will also award
a prize for the best table theme.
The event will feature several
student bands which will play in

-

30-minute sessions..

Those interested in competing
can enter the cook—off for a fee
of $50. Entrants may register as
a team, as well. Advance tickets
to the event, which are being sold
in the Commons for $3, guarantee
entrance and as much chili as you
can eat. Chi 0 will also sell tickets
at the door on Thursday for $5.
Donations are accepted as well.

Men’s

The Generals defeated Virginia Wesleyan

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

Rebounding from its only loss of the
season against Franklin & Marshall the
week before, the Washington and Lee
men’s lacrosse team kicked off confer-
ence play with a new winning streak.
Generals knocked off ODAC foe Vir-
ginia Wesleyan, 1 1-5, on Saturday to im-
prove to 7-1 overall and 1-0 in ODACS.

Facing off against F&M, the Gener-
als were unable to overcome four early
goals by the Diplomats. Down 2-] in the
ﬁrst quarter, another early deﬁcit loomed
over the Generals. But this time the
Generals weren’t the victims of strong
ﬁrst-quarter play. The Generals outshot
the Marlins 10-5 and quickly turned the
lead around with back-to-back goals by
junior attack Spencer Daw with assists

Heading into the second quarter,
the Generals lead 3-2 and never looked
back. Two more consecutive goals from
senior midﬁelder Logan Bartlett put the
Generals up 5-2. Assists went to Means
and Keigler.

The Marlins rebounded with a goal
of their own, but Bartlett was right there
to answer, recording his third goal of the
game off another assist from Keigler.

The third-quarter offense was all
W&L. W&L outshot the Marlins, 8-6,
and Means and Keigler each posted a
goal during the period to push the Gen-
erals ahead 8-3 and put the game away
for good.

Daw and Means led the Generals
with three goals and two assists each.
Keigler totaled one goal and ﬁve assists
and Bartlett had three nets and one as-
sist.

Senior goalie Matt Mason held strong
in the goal for the Generals, recording
seven saves versus ﬁve goals.

W&L will travel to Georgetown

match—up against No. 5—ranked Middle-

is set for 7 p.m.

Junior Will Hall takes a cut at a forehand in W&L’s loss to N.C.

“Beating Mary Washington was

results,” said sophomore Mac Davis, in
reference to the two losses.

and doubles. The entire team played
well, but junior Will Hall singled out
one player in particular, stressing that
“Johnny Gragg played tremendous at
No. 6 singles.”

Wednesday brought then-l4th-
ranked N.C. Wesleyan and a rough 6-3
loss. The box score fails to show just
how close the day was, with two of the
losses going into a third set and one of
those going into a tie-breaker.

N.C. Wesleyan also brought “[a

bunch of] foreign players who all play
different styles than many people on the
team are used to,” Hall said.

No. 1 doubles team senior Alex
Brooke and sophomore Jonathan Gaff-
ney and No. 2 doubles team ﬁrst—year
Hayden White and sophomore Jeremy
Becht each pulled out victories in close
matches that ended with tie—breakers.
The lone singles victory of the day came
from No. l-seed White, who managed to
put his opponent away in two sets.

No. 2 singles player Becht and No.
5 Michael Freeman each took their op-
ponents to a third seed, with Becht push-
ing his opponent, Kale Nikunen, to the
limits with set scores of 4-6, 7-5, and 6-
7. Such close games make falling short
even more difﬁcult to handle, though
they do show just how good a team can
be, White said.

“Although the loss to NC Wesleyan
was extremely frustrating and disap-
pointing, the match gave us a good
barometer on how well we can do this
year,” said White.

The Generals now need to just focus
on putting their skills to good use and
turning those close matches into victo-
ries.

“We compete in every match we
play,” Davis said. “It’s just a matter of
getting everyone playing well at the
same time.”

The ﬁnal game of the week, played
last Friday afternoon, resulted in the
team’s ﬁrst conference loss of the sea-
son, and according to White, was “per-
haps the most frustrating” match of the

Busted NCAA brackets

A crazy opening weekend saw many top-rated teams knocked 0/7

By Adam Cancryn
COLUMNIST

What a weekend. Four days, 64 teams,
48 games and a number of shocking
upsets that left the power conferences
licking their wounds.

Wisconsin, No. 2-seeded Villanova
and, improbably, top-seeded Kansas
all fell to victim to mid-major upstarts,
a development that spelled doom for
brackets everywhere.

More importantly, however, the
weekend’s games demonstrated that
college basketball’s balance of power
might be shifting. Smaller schools are
narrowing the talent gap, helping them
consistently compete with the powers
that traditionally dominate the month of
March.

Few outside of central California
knew the name Omar Samhan before the
tournament’s ﬁrst round. And, judging
by the way Villanova tried and failed to
guard St. Mary’s 7-foot center, they too
were slow on the uptake. After scoring 29
points in the opener against Richmond,
Samhan came back and dropped 32 on
heavily favored ’Nova.

A team that relies on the fast-paced
play of its guards, Villanova could do
nothing but flail in vain as Samhan
repeatedly caught the ball down low, spun
and banked it in.

Fouling him didn’t work. A 73-percent
free throw shooter, he converted six of
eight attempts.

Double-teaming didn’t work either.
Either Samhan would ﬁght through _the
smaller defenders and lay it in, or kick
it out to one of the No. l0-seeded Gaels’

ﬁne shooters, who buried seven threes
including a 25-footer to seal the game.

A day later, Wisconsin ran into the
same dilemma. Comell’s Jeff Foot, also
a 7-footer of little national renown, took
control of the interior. He tallied 12
points and seven rebounds and provided
his team with the outlet passes necessary
to force Wisconsin out of its trademark
plodding style.

With Foot entrenched in the middle
and 6-foot 6 swingman Ryan Whitman
heaving shots over his significantly
shorter defenders, Cornell shot 61 percent
and put up 87 total points against a
Wisconsin team that held opponents to
a regular season average of just 56 per
game.

This has become a trend among mid-
majors facing power conference teams;
superior height coupled with solid 3-
point shooting can keep any team in the
game, regardless of the gap in talent.
While teams like ’Nova, Wisconsin and
Kansas might have superior athletes,
their opponents have utilized superior
strategy, taking advantage of mismatches
and maintaining control of the game’s
tempo.

The basic formula can only take a team
so far, though. Past mid-majors have hit
perimeter shots and controlled the interior
with pure height rather than skill, yet still
been overrun late by the better team.

The difference this year is that smaller
schools have vastly improved on the
defensive end, employing a suffocating
team defense that has frustrated the likes

of future NBA players Sherron Collins
and Scottie Reynolds.

Northern Iowa, en route to its bracket-
busting victory, slowed Kansas’ offense
with its steady, smothering defense. This
slowed the game’s pace signiﬁcantly,
forcing the normally run-and-gun
Jayhawks to play half-court basketball.
UNl’s rope-a-dope style frustrated Kansas
into low-percentage shots and their
second chances. The result: 27 percent
shooting from 3-point range and just 67
total points. During the regular season,
the Jayhawks averaged 40.4 percent and
81.6 points.

With Cornell and St. Mary’s doing
similar jobs against their power conference
opponents, we enter the Sweet 16 with
perhaps the strongest trio of Cinderella
teams in recent memory. While Xavier in
2009 and Davidson in ’08 were certainly
memorable squads, there are few that
have so effectively neutralized opponents’
biggest threats.

For the rest of this tournament, teams
will have to adjust their game plans
around the underdogs rather than vice
versa. Fail to do that and, come next week,
those brackets could look even worse.

week. The team left Hampton-Sydney
with a 5-4 loss and “a bitter taste in
[their] mouths,” White said.

The team’s match-up against Hamp-
ton-Sydney was a repeat of the 2009
ODAC Championship game, a match
that also resulted in a W&L loss.

The doubles teams of White and
Becht, and Davis and Hall, playing at
the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds respectively,
each pulled out wins. Singles brought
two more victories from Hall at No. 3
and Brooke at No. 6. Three of the four
singles losses went into 3rd sets.

A theme of revenge popped up fre-
quently among members of the team.

“This loss will make our team much
hungrier to beat Hampden-Sydney when
we play them later this spring in the
ODAC Championships,” said White.

“We’re looking to put Hamp-
den-Sydney’s head on a platter, come
ODACs,” Davis added.

Another theme that frequently
emerged was the strong support each
member has for the individuals on the
team. In a sport that sometimes focuses
more on individuals, this team truly wins
and losses as a team, with each player
rarely focusing on himself and constant-
ly highlighting the strengths and hard
work ofthose around him.

The Generals ﬁnished the week with
a 7-4 overall record and a 6-1 confer-
ence record.

W&L trumps Guilford

A double-header victory improved the Generals to 6-8, 4-3 in ODACS

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

Another rocky start to the week for the
Washington and Lee baseball team was
quickly forgotten after back-to-back late
inning heroics on Saturday versus Guil-
ford. The team split a doubleheader with
Roanoke (2-4, 6-0) on Tuesday, dropped
a non-conference game to Stevenson on
Wednesday (9-7), then stole both games
from Guilford during their Saturday dou-
bleheader (5-4, 5-4).

Tough weather conditions earlier in the
season forced W&L and Roanoke to make
up their previously canceled weekend
games last Tuesday. There was not much
to write home about in the ﬁrst game, as
the Maroons used a four-run fourth inning
to carry them to a 4-2 win.

Senior pitcher Chuck Davidson took
the tough-luck loss as he dropped to 0-3
on the season. In the other dugout, Cody
Kidd scattered four hits across four score-
less innings of work for the win. Senior
ﬁrst baseman Hunter Serenbetz had him-
self a nice week and got things rolling
with a 2-3 performance at the plate and
was responsible for W&L’s only runs, a
two RBI single in the seventh.

Game. two was another story. Perfect
pitching and timely hitting ﬁnally came
together for the Generals and added up to
a 6-0 win for the good guys. Sophomore
pitcher Roger Strong worked six innings
for the win, surrendering it mere three hits
while fanning six hapless Maroons. Junior
pitcher Greg Laswell completed the shut-
out by working the last third of the game
and picking up a save in the process.

At the plate, junior outﬁelder Anthony
Cardona led the Generals’ offensive attack
with a big 3-5 day in which he knocked

in two RBIs and scored two runs himself.
W&Ljumped out to a 4-0 lead in the ﬁrst
and never looked back.

The next day, the team came home to
face off with Stevenson College and, de-
spite a late rally, still fell to Mustangs, 9-
7. First-year shortstop Jonathan Stutts had
a great afternoon, getting the Generals on
the board first with a solo bomb to deep
left center and then sparking a ninth-in-
ning rally. Stutts’ home run started a three-
run third inning for W&L. Sophomore
outﬁelder Mike Decembrino and senior
catcher Will Lewis each added an RBI.

Senior second baseman John Ditore looks toward home plate as
he begins a slide for the winning run of the game.

Things quickly turned south, how-
ever, when the Mustangs exploded for a
six-run, seven-hit ﬁfth inning. Stevenson
grew the lead to 9-3 with three more runs
in the sixth.

Down 9-4 entering the bottom of the
ninth, Stutts rapped a RBI single, followed
by a two-run double from ﬁrst-year out-
ﬁelder George Youmans.

But senior second baseman John Di-
t0re”s hard liner was caught and turned
into a double play that ended the game
before W&L could come all the way back.
The rally had the crowd riveted.

“lt’s baseball; anything can happen,”
said spectator Kit Burgin.

The Generals were set to play two
more games on Saturday against Guilford.
A beautiful day, a big crowd and a confer-
ence rival set the stage for a drama-ﬁlled
day. Down 4-3 entering the last at bat of
both games, W&L rallied both times for
two 5-4 walk-off wins.

in game one, senior outﬁelder C]
Thompson singled with one out and scored
on a Ditore single and a throwing error.
After a hit batter and a Lewis single to
load the bases, Serenbetz singled to give
the Generals the win.

The script in game two read very
similar. Thompson led off with a double.
Ditore then singled and advanced on a
sacriﬁce bunt by sophomore second base-
man Alston James. Lewis was intention-
ally walked to ﬁll the bases and Serenbetz
knocked in Thompson with a grounder to
third that ‘was misplayed. Cardona then
singled, scoring Ditore and giving W&L
its second win of the day.

Laswell completed a ﬁne week of

pitching with two wins in relief.

The wins on Saturday bumped the
Generals’ record to 6-8 on the year, but
more importantly, they are now 4-3 in the
ODAC after a slow start to the year.

The team is still looking for continued
consistency and hopes to build off of Sat-
urdays’ success. The team’s next game is
Tuesday at Shenandoah. The ﬁrst pitch
will be at 3:30 p.m.
