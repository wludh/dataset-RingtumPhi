W&L lzostsﬁrst annual
festival for alumni of 50
years or more

By Chelsea Stevenson
8 TA F F W R I T E R

What do a former D1 scholarship football player,
a Pulitzer Prize winner for his book on news media
and a 1939 college graduate have in common? Along
with 75 other men, these three distinguishable W&L
alums were all on campus last week for the first annual
Five-Star General alumni festival. This is an honor-
ary festival for W&L alums who have previously
celebrated their 50th college reunion.

During these three days, 75 W&L alums came
from all over the country, including Los Angeles,
Chicago and Atlanta, to attend a serious of programs
and a concluding dinner in Evans Hall, with students
and President Ruscio.

One panel in particular was focused on the changes
in W&L athletics. W&L alum Bill McHenry, who at-
tended W&L on a D1 football scholarship in the 1950’
s and who became the W&L athletic director from
1971-1958 sat on this panel with the current athletic
director Janine Hathom and the director who served
between their terms. Following this presentation,
several alums raved about the new Wilson Stadium.

A second outstanding program was presented by
Alex Jones, ‘68. Mr. Jones, a current news media
and journalism professor at Harvard, is a 1987 Pu-
litzer Prize winner. His presentation focused on his
current role in media today and his views on serious
reporting.

The alumni ofﬁce put a signiﬁcant amount of
planning to make this event happen and to make it
stand out among their other alumni events. Executive
Director of Alurrmi Affairs Mr. Waller Dudley said the
ofﬁce, “tried to create a very different, custom-made
event, and give [it] all the attention we can muster.”

Dudley said the alumni ofﬁce wanted to create a
separate festival for the Five—Star Generals because
the annual Reunion Weekend in May was becoming
too large and too difﬁcult to program for alums rang-
ing from 25 to 85 years old.

Now, the alumni ofﬁce hopes to host three reunion
weekends a year. The ﬁrst will continue to be over
homecoming, but will be focused on alums from the
past ten years, with a special plan to increase the
engagement of young alums.

This year’s Young Alumni Weekend was a large
success, with an attendance passing several hundred.
The all-time single class record was also broken this
year, with 128 members of the class of 1999 celebrat-
ing their tenth-year reunion.

Following homecoming will be the Five-Star
General Festival, which will be held sometime in the
late fall each year. Finally, the traditional Reunion
Weekend will still be held in May for alums who are
celebrating the years between their tenth and ﬁftieth
reunions.

Although very successful, the alumni ofﬁce cannot
complete all of these successful events without the
help of W&L students.

Kathekon is a group of approximately 50 W&L
juniors and seniors who are afﬁliated with the alumni
ofﬁce. These students also implement the SPEAK
tradition at the annual barbecue for ﬁrst-years. In the
alumni ofﬁce, they are educated on special events
and on becoming well-connected alumni so that
upon their graduation, they become active in the 90
W&L alumni chapters across the country and in the
United Kingdom.

Senior Julie Sanders said Kathekon is a way to
connect with alums.

“I hope to stay connected with the school after
I leave, and [Kathekon] is a fun group of people to
work with and a way to connect to the professors,”
she said.

During the F ive-Star General festival, Kathekon
members served as greeters to the visiting alums,
making them feel comfortable. Sanders said it makes
it easier for the alums to know there is a speciﬁc group
of students they can talk to.

Additionally, the Kathekon members played a
large role in the transportation of the alums around
campus on golf carts, ensuring that they get to and
from each planned activity and that they see the parts
of campus they want to see.

Kathekon member junior Emmy Mathews said she
loved her role during the festival.

“It was great to meet a lot of alumni and get their
insight. It’s surprising how similar their student ex-
perience at W&L is to ours,” she said.

Washington and Lee students will
soon face a slew of changes in re-
gard to winter registration and class
times.

As students may have noticed
while planning their winter term
schedules, the registrar no longer
lists letters for the times of class. The
actual time spans are listed instead,
due to the fact that some class times
have been altered. '

In addition, students will regis-
ter for two classes during the ﬁrst
week of registration, and register
for another two the following week.
The changes were proposed by the
Registration‘ and Class Scheduling
Committee and approved by the Uni-
versity Registrar and the Faculty Ex-
ecutive Committee.

Classes are now listed by actual
times because certain classes will
now only be scheduled for 85-minute
blocks. The class time changes stem
from the need to use the available
space effectively. Many Tuesday/
Thursday classes which are currently
scheduled for two,hours only actu-
ally take an hour and half.

University Registrar Scott Dit-
man explained that the change to 85-
minute classes is necessary because
in the current system, “We’re basi-
cally wasting that half hour.”

With the new system, ﬁve classes

can take place in the middle of the
day on Tuesdays and Thursdays in-
stead of four. Also, due to the cur-
rent construction on the Colonnade,
there are fewer classrooms available
for use, so shorter blocks allows for
more classes to take place in the
available space.

The decision to change the meth-
od of registration from all at once
to two at a time came about due to
the positive results from last year’s
freshman and sophomore spring
term registration. Unlike juniors and
seniors, freshmen and sophomores
chose one class they wanted to take
in the spring of 2009 and then chose
a second the following week.

Although the change will obvi-
ously increase freshmen and sopho-
mores’ chances of getting in to class-
es they need, Ditman says that some
juniors and seniors were also miss-
ing out on upper level classes they
needed, especially in the business
department.

Some upperclassmen are not par-
ticularly -happy about the changes.
The class of 2010 has had to deal
with being the last class subject to
general education requirements, and
is now facing changes to spring term
and their last winter term on cam-
pus.

“I’m annoyed that the class of

Changes include new time blocks and diﬂerent registration procedures

2010 is not enjoying privileges that
past senior classes have had,” senior
Andrew Sackman said. '

Ditman said he understands that
the large number of changes may be
overwhelming and that it is totally
coincidental that they are all happen-
ing at the same time.

“People’s tolerance for change is
beginning to reach a limit,” he said.

Still, he does not see any major
problems coming from the changes.
Not only does he point out that the
“culture of negotiation,” such a get-
ting into a class with the professor’s
permission even ifthe class is ﬁlll, is
a tried and true tradition at.W&L, but
he also thinks more changes could
come.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if there is
even more negotiating,” he said.

While students focus on pre-reg-
istering for winter term, they must
also keep in mind that that spring
term pre-registration is right around
the corner.

Students will pre-register for
their top 3 spring term choices after
Thanksgiving break and actually reg-
ister some time early in winter term.

Ditman cautions students to pay
close attention to the time require-
ments of new spring term classes,
because classroom time may not
be fully reﬂective of the amount of

  

time actually required for the course.
Faculty members may post syllabi
to give students an idea of what the
classes will demand.

Along with the changes made to
the class times and dates, students
will see different methods of choos-
ing courses. There is the new two-
and-two method, and there is what-
ever practice the Registrar decides
will work best for new Spring Term.

However, in regards to the future
of W&L class registration, Ditman
does not anticpate chanigng back to
the former method.

“The changes that we’re imple-
menting this year are probably going
to stick,” he said.

Students concerned about how

the changes might affect their aca- ‘

demic career should be pleased to
hear that the Ditman is making him-
self more accessible. He was in the
Marketplace Wednesday afternoon,
answering quick questions from stu-
dents and advising them on any short
concerns that might have.

He plans to continue this practice
in the future, especially during preg-
istration and registration periods.
Students should be on the lookout
for similar opportunites to brieﬂy
discuss how the changes to registra-
tion might affect them.

Death of a newspaper  

1968 alum Alex Jones speaks on the future of journalism

By Jessica Strait
STAFF WRITER

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist
and 1968 W&L graduate Alex Jones
discussed the future of newspapers
last Wednesday in a program that
was part of the Five-Star Alumni
Festival. -

Jones’ biggest concern in the
decline of newspapers is a parallel
decline in the hard-hitting news, or
what he refers to as the “iron core,”
that is vital to our successful self-
governing as a people.

The problem is that newspapers
do roughly 85 percent of this re-
porting, but these same newspapers
are shrinking in size at an alarming
rate—The New York Times plans to
cut 100 jobs by the end of the year.
Throw the digital revolution and cur-
rent economic climate into the mix,
and newspapers are in hot water.

Released earlier this year, Jones’
book, “Losing the News: the Future
of the News That Feed Democracy,”
is aimed at an audience concerned
with the effects of the changing news
industry and curious about what can
be done to save it.

Jones said he fears that‘ without
newspapers, traditional journalism
values essential to democracy are in
jeopardy.

“We’re moving toward valuing
voice, point of view and subjectiv-
ity over genuine objectivity,” said

Jones.

Jones said most news today relies
on entertainment, and in the digital
world, people value speed over ac-
curacy to the point of addiction. In-
depth reporting is now undervalued,
and although he sees the importance
of convergence media, Jones thinks
it may just be a phase. He stressed
to students that the most important
thing to do in classes is learn how
to write and to be wary of becoming
a jack-of-all-trades and a master of

‘ I10I'1C.

Jones, a self-proclaimed “tra-
ditional news guy,” does not think
newspapers will disappear anytime
soon, because many people like‘ him
are willing to pay to have their paper
on their porch to read how they want
it, when they want it.

In Jones’ case, that means with
his cup of coffee ﬁrst thing in the
morning. Although Jones said he un-
derstands that news must enter the
digital age, his main concern with
the transition is ﬁnding a way to de-
liver the news so it has an impact and
does not get lost in the “maelstrom of
what’s online.” J

This “bloody time for news” is
not only affecting big papers like The
New York Times; community jour-
nalism is struggling aswell. And it
hits close to home—The Greeneville

Sun, Jones’ family newspaper, just
experienced layoffs for the ﬁrst time
in its history. According to Jones, 10-
cal papers are becoming more like
local television in that they do not
write about anything that might drive
readers away. Instead, papers choose
to avoid politics and instead focus on
weather, features, sports and other
light topics.

As a result, newspapers that once
claimed social responsibility to pro-
vide information to citizens are now
faltering in their commitment. At
the same time, a disconnect exists
in readers—they may say they want
someone to be a watchdog at the
statehouse, but the same people will
not read long investigative articles
on the subject. Nevertheless, to en-
sure a counterweight to power, Jones
said we need strong, accountable re-
porters to tell it like it is.

“Newspapers are giving people
what they want as opposed to what
they might need,” said Jones.

Despite the downward spiral of
newspapers, Jones is hopeful that
news and select newspapers will
survive. He said that The New York
Times has made a market-driven
decision to remain strictly a news
source, and he believes the paper
will stay the course. Jones said he
bets on the quality of the paper, trusts

in a democracy

that devoted readers will offer sup-
port and hopes the Times will serve
as a model for other papers.

Jones comes from a strong jour-
nalism background—his family has
owned The Greeneville Sun, based
in Greeneville, TN, for four genera-
tions. But when he came to W&L in
1964, he was in “full rebellion ﬂight
mode” from this family tradition and
instead majored in history. But last
week when he came back to W&L,
a place he “reveres,” Jones simply
could not stay away from the pull of
journalism.

Jones said he was thrilled to be
back on campus and shared a vivid
memory of the beautiful spring day
in 1967 when he was walking up
the Colonnade and thought with a
start, “Oh my Ggod! In another year,
they’re going to make me leave!”

He was awarded a W&L honor-
ary doctor of humane letters last
May and currently directs the Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Pol-
itics and Public Policy, part of Har-
vard University’s John F. Kennedy
School of Government. Jones is also
the author of two other books.

The discussion was held in Stack-
house and moderated by Professor
Richardson, head of W&L’s Journal-
ism Department.

Bright lights, small city: Lexvegas

Lexington ranked as one of the “coolest” small towns, locals ecstatic about the recognition

By Jessica Strait
STA F F W R IT E R

Lexington’s small-town size
classiﬁcation is common knowl-
edge to its visitors and residents,
but most people are unaware that
Lexington was also recently cat-
egorized in a new way: cool. In a
CNN.com article released online
Oct. 19, Lexington was named
one of the “Top 10 Coolest Small
Towns in America.”

out, it can be easy to forget what
a ‘cool’ place it is. I think that

this article serves as a reminder .

to us all of what a special place
our town really is and how im-
portant tourism is to our local
economy.”

A1 Hockaday, co-owner of
the The Shenandoah Attic, said
he also sees the ranking as good

gift shops (if he says so himself)
as reasons why Lexington is a
wonderful place to visit and an
excellent place to live.

But the biggest contributing
cool factor of Lexington, Hocka-
day said, is “the people; abso-
lutely, positively, number one,
the people.”

Rick Beville, who works

“Lexington has a pulse to it that a lot of small towns don ’t, and a lot

of that is due to the colleges... The town isn ’t stale and dead, and it

hasn ’t lost its orignal ﬂavor. ”
RICK BEVILLE, worker at Cocoa Mllls Chocolatlers

The article, based on rankings
by Budget Travel magazine, said
locals often describe Lexington,
population 6,867, as “right out of
a Norman Rockwell painting.” It
names Hull’s Drive-In Theatre,
George and Bob, Pumpkinseeds
and The Red Hen as favorite lo-
cal attractions and quotes resi-
dents who adore Lexington for
its history, sense of community
and safety-net atmosphere.

The Lexington Tourism Of-
ﬁce said it is is “ecstatic” about
Lexington’s newly bestowed
title, and that visitation to their
website has already risen dra-
matically since Lexington made
the list.

“We receive inquiries on a
daily basis as a result of this ar-
ticle,” said a representative from
the tourism ofﬁce. “When you
live in Lexington day in and day

news for Lexington and hopes
that it will bring more business
to the town and his gift shop.

“I think it could very well
have an impact,” he said. “If you
lived close to one of the top 10
coolest small towns, wouldn’t
you want to visit?”

Lexington, which has also
been named a “top place to live”
and a “top place to retire” by oth-
er publications in the past, tops
residents’ own personal lists for
varying reasons.

Hockaday has lived in Lex-
ington on and off since 1974,
when he moved here to help start
the Naval ROTC program at
VMI. The town opened its arms
to him back then, so when he and
his wife were deciding on where
to retire, the choice was easy. He
cites the superb hotels, wonder-
ful restaurants and tremendous

at Cocoa Mills Chocolatlers,
agrees.

“Lexington has a pulse to it
that a lot of small towns don’t,
and a lot of that is due to the col-
leges,” said Beville. “There are
also a lot of musicians, artists,
and creative people. That creates
a good feeling. The town isn’t
stale and dead, and it hasn’t‘lost
its original ﬂavor.”

Beville, originally from Rich-
mond, moved here eight years
ago and prefers the small-town
life to the big city. As a cyclist,
the geography of the area was a
key determining factor in why
he choose Lexington, and like
many students and residents, he
takes advantage of the “beautiful
hikes” and mountain views.

Wade Bell, a biology pro-
fessor at VMI, said he sees the
ranking as a tourism-boosting

ploy but acknowledges that tour-
ists are great for the town and
“help our bottom line.” Bell also
said most of the town’s coolness
stems from college students at
W&L and VMI.

“College students make any
town a neat place to be,” said
Bell. “They give youth and ener-
gy to older people who otherwise
might only have work.”

Whether or not Lexington’s
ranking will result in a‘ surge of
W&L applications has yet to be
seen, but Dave Leonard, Dean of
First Year Students, said he has
high hopes for the article’s im-

pact.

“Such positive press can only
aid in the cultivation of greater
prospective interest,” said Dean
Leonard. “I suspect the positive
proﬁling of lovely Lexington
may resonate even more deeply
for their parents in terms of vaca-
tion and travel.”

Dean Leonard has lived in
Lexington for seven years. He
said Lexington is cool because
“it’s a great location in which to
live, learn and for those of us a
little older, to raise a family.”

According to’ the online ar-
ticle, the criteria for a cool small

town is one that’s gotten every-
thing right—“great coffee, food
with character, shop owners with
a purpose”—and residents of
Lexington appear to be prouder
than ever of their charming, his-
toric town and its new title.

“I think it makes the entire
town and all of its people spe-
cial,” said Hockaday.

Other small towns that made
the list are Cayucos, Calif.,
Breaux Bridge, La., Tubac, Ariz.,
Wallace, Idaho, Saugerties, N.Y.,
Mount Vernon, Iowa, Jackson-

Opinions

A comprehensive guide to surviving Parents Weekend

Stockton Bullitt gives advice on impressing the visiting parents and hiding the bad stuﬂ this weekend

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

The dreaded Parents Week-
end is ﬁnally here, not coinciden-
tally on Halloween, the scariest
holiday. For all of you blissfully
ignorant ﬁrst-years who are ex-
cited to see your parents after
two months away, be prepared
for quite a weekend.

To brag, I am one of the
school’s foremost experts on
Parents Weekend. I have sur-
vived ﬁve since high school
started, and I even earned recog-
nition as a child prodigy when I
hit kindergarten’s Grandparents’
Day out of the park. What can I
say? Some people are born to do
math. Others are born to survive
Parents Weekend.

The real problem with Par-
ents Weekend is that it is basi-
cally 72 hours of time that your
parents get to ﬁnd out everything
bad about your life. Further-
more, Parent’s Weekend gives
parents 72 hours to make sure
that you are earning every bit of
the tuition they are paying. Trust
me, you do not want this. If your
parents had their way, you would
be doing your Advanced Physics
during a rousing game of chess.
Oh, and all of this would be done
sober.

Fortunately, you have an ex-
pert to help you out.

The ﬁrst thing you need to
learn about Parents Weekend is
that surviving Parents Weekend
is built on the same foundation
that makes families thrive in
general: lots and lots of lying.
Really, you can’t have enough of
it. And that is what this weekend
has to be all about. You need to

paint a picture for your parents.
In that picture, you are not only
a respectable student, but also a
clean, polite, respectful, estab—'
lished member of society. If you
are anything like me, painting
this picture takes a Blagojevich
level of lying. From Friday until
Sunday, you should be primar-
ily concerned with deceiving
your parents into loving you that
much more.

Let’s start with the bedroom.
Now, obviously you want to
clean your room before your par-
ents come. Everyone knows that.
But there are some details of
which you need to be aware be-
fore you let your parents in. First
of all, you should clean your
room a day or two before your
parents come, not much sooner.
If you clean it up too soon, there
may be a couple of stray shirts or
pants that drunkenly end up on
the ﬂoor.

This is the weekend when
you ﬁnally break the plastic off
those textbooks that you bought
in early September. You should
probably throw them around the
room a little bit or color on them
for a little while so they look suf-
ﬁciently used. Make sure you
place them neatly--not too neatly,
your parents don’t want to enter
a museum--on your desk.

Also, stop by the library and
pick up a book by a famous in-
tellectual to put beside your bed.
If you are out of ideas, go with
Proust, Hemingway or Dickens.
My mom always falls for Dick-
ens. Go to somewhere between
pages 100 and 200 in the book

and make an ear mark. That way,
when your parents ask you what
the book is about you can accu-
rately respond, “Well, I’m in the
middle, but I still don’t really get
it.” If you make your fake inden-
tation too far along in the book,
you’ll probably have to explain
the plot, and unless you antici-

ever going to happen, especially
if your teacher has yet to get the
chocolates you sent her. You al-
ready ordered the chocolates,
right? Amateur.

Anyway, there is only one
right way to portray yourself to
your parents with regards to aca-
demics. They should leave this

The real problem with

Parents Weekend is

that it is basically 72 hours of time that your

parents get to ﬁnd out everything bad about

your life.

pated and read the Wikipedia ar-
ticle on it, you might be in a bit
of trouble.

Now, obviously you don’t
want any kinds of alcohol or
drug paraphernalia in your room,
but why stop there? You need to
convince your parents. Get some
Juicy Juice gallons and some of
W&L’s wonderful safe drinking
posters to decorate your room.
It’s a safe bet.

For the school aspect, you’re
probably thinking that it would
be best to try and portray your-
self as the most intelligent stu-
dent in the school. False. This is
why you’re not the expert.

The problem with that meth-
od is that your parents are going
to expect a 4.0 on every report
card and gleaming reviews from
every teacher. It’s not like that

weekend thinking that you are
the dumbest student in the school
but the hardest worker. Parents,
like any other adults, adore peo-
ple with no brains and a great
work ethic. That way, when you
get an A, all of the adults can feel
like they played a role in you get-
ting that grade. Aren’t old people
adorable?

There are a couple of ways
to convince your parents of your
apparent stupidity and diligence.
The highlighted books in your
room will help but don’t stop
there. You need a multi-pronged
front to overcome your parents’
assumptions. Pay some people in
your grade to purposefully pass
by you and your parents in the
quad and mention the scheduled
study group that you apparently
set up.

Deeds gets dirty but still will not win

With Virginia is gubernatorial election coming up, Abel Delgado
chastises Democrat Creigh Deeds ’dirty campaigning

By Abel Delgado
c o LU M N I s T

Next week will mark the end
of the Virginia govemor’s race
and, one would hope, an end to
statewide mudslinging. But if
this rather dirty election cam-
paign has taught us anything, it
is that the type of mud that gets
thrown around matters.

Republican Bob McDonnell’s
mud has been substantive. He
has labeled his Democratic ad-
versary, Creigh Deeds, a “tax and
spend liberal” because Deeds has
actually proposed to raise taxes.
Deeds would argue McDonnell
is obsessed with this fact, but at
least McDonnell is arguing about
something in his opponent’s plat-
form.

Besides that, the McDonnell
campaign has been primarily
about Bob McDonnell and what
he wants to do for Virginia.

Deeds’ mud has been signiﬁ-
cantly less substantive and sig-
niﬁcantly messier. He has tried
to cast McDonnell as some sort
of arch-conservative sexist, bas-
ing most of his "claims—and prac-
tically his entire campaign—on a
graduate thesis McDonnell wrote
twenty years ago. Can you imag-
ine being judged in 2029 for a
paper you are working on now?
I make arguments in papers I do
not personally agree with all the
time.

This is not to say there are
worrisome aspects of the the-
sis that McDonnell might have
agreed with at one time, but if
the best argument you can come
up for as to why you should be
elected concerns something your
opponent wrote twenty years ago,
you might have a problem.

The Deeds campaign’s heavy
focus on McDonnell’s graduate

thesis is to everyone’s detriment.
This is not just the sentiment of
party-line Republicans. Promi-
nent Democrats have begged
Deeds to portray a more positive
message for over a month.

The election campaign can be
summed up in three stages. First,
the candidates debated‘ on the
issues and Deeds trailed in the
polls badly.

Next, Deeds refocused his
campaign to an onslaught of per-
sonal attacks on McDonnell’s
views, which helped him close
the gap signiﬁcantly.

Still, he could not manage to
overtake McDonnell in the polls.

Finally, the public has recog-
nized the dirty Deeds strategy
and McDonnell now has a com-
fortable lead. The lead is so com-
fortable, in fact, that Republicans
are hoping Deeds brings down
the rest of the Virginian Demo-
cratic ticket.

It wasn’t supposed to be this
way. Virginia has turned blue
the past few election cycles, and
it should, have continued on its
blue swing. McDonnell is the
old-school conservative type that
is supposed to be a fossil in the
Obama Era, not a front-runner.

Deeds, the more moderate
and less tarnished candidate of
the Democratic Primary, was
supposed to run a unifying cam-
paign. However, negativity threw
unity out the window.

The Deeds message hasn’t
just been negative. It’s been a
farce. McDonnell’s oldest daugh-
ter served as an Army ofﬁcer and
his other daughters earned mas-
ter’s degrees. Does this sound
like someone who wants to keep
women as homemakers?

The Deeds campaign had the
audacity to run an ad claiming
McDonnell was against funding
for mammograms.

This rightfully infuriated can-
cer survivors who support Mc-
Donnell.

As Stephanie Hamlett said, “It
offends me as a woman, it offends
me as a breast cancer survivor,
and it offends me as a Virginian.

I know Creigh badly wants to be
governor, but does he really want

to try to win like this?”

Currently, all signs point to
Deeds losing. Hopefully, this will
serve as a warning to politicians
that if you try to win at any cost,
you are even more vulnerable to

losing.

Get involved. And don't be afraid to step up and take charge even
when you are just a first year or a sophomore. Don't wait until
you are a junior/ senior to start an organization or to run for a
leadership position. A leader does not have to the "popular kid"

Leadership

Tuesdays With Leadership:

12:15 and 6:30 PM, Room 216 Elrod Commons
Explore the concept of adaptive leadership, in which
leaders surface conﬂict, challenge beliefs and seek new
ways of doing things without incurring too much personal
risk and remaining anchored to principles.

On The Line

Schedule a meeting with the
teacher in your token class where
you do work hard. Your grade in
the class doesn’t matter whatso-

ever, as long as the teacher thinks .

you work hard. That way, your
parents will be convinced that
you are a hard worker and will
blame the teacher for calling you
an idiot, and you will look like

' the good guy.

Next, give your parents the
tour of your favorite classrooms
and lecture halls on campus. Re-
member to show them the carrel
in the library you never used un-
til you planted folders and bind-
ers there, and remember to show
your parents the writing center
where you never go. Just make
sure you show them at a time
when there is nobody in the writ-
ing center.

You also need to emphasize
the extracurricular group you
belong to, whether it is factual
or ﬁctitious. There’s no South
American Appreciation Club on
campus? There is now.

There‘ are also some unused
club sports at W&L that your par-
ents could easily be duped into
believing in. Imagine, you could
be the captain of your very own
croquet, badminton, or cricket
team! Just hire some ﬁiends to
be your teammates and a home-
less guy to be your coach. And
the reason you are not playing
this week is because “UVA can-
celed at the last minute. That’s
the problem with playing [insert
club sport here] in the state of
Virginia.”

The dinner is probably the

easiest thing to take care of. All
you need to do is book one of
the expensive restaurants in Lex-
ington (in other words, anything
above Hardee’s), and make a sad
glance at your empty wallet once
the check comes. Pity is the best
way to get free stuff. Oh, and re-
member to read the Wall Street
Journal before going to dinner.
That way you can pretend to
have some idea about mergers
and acquisitions and have your
parents actually approve of you
for once.

The last thing you need to
worry about is the late-night par-
ties. Remember, you never have
more than three beers in a night
because of a DARE commercial
you saw on alcohol poisoning.
They don’t need to know about
Windfall later that night. Also,
ﬁrst—years, you are rushing the
particular fraternity or soror-
ity because of the value they
place on GPA and’ philanthropy
events.

So, now you have a pretty
good guide to get through this
weekend. If you follow my ad-
vice, I can’t guarantee an obnox-
iously nice Christmas present,
but since grades won’t be report-
ed until the presents are already
bought, kissing some major ass
this Parents Weekend can get
you far in life.

Other colleges don’t, but you guys have it good

When other universities are having a tough time making ends meet, W&L students should appreciate what they have

By Jordan Rothman
COPY EDITOR

Right now, countless uni-
versities across the country are
experiencing trouble due to the
ongoing ﬁnancial crisis. This is
especially a problem for endow-
ment-dependent institutions,
which have seen their invest-
ments diminish without being
able to ﬁll their budgetary gaps
with the open purses of donors.

Coming from a university
that is experiencing particularly
intense problems due to the ﬁ-
nancial downturn, I know ﬁrst-
hand the trouble that this crisis
has created in higher education.
Yet it seems that this campus has
not been as greatly affected by
the downturn as other institutions
and we should all be thankful for
the luxuries we enjoy at W&L.

All told, I thought I would
write my article this week about
how awesome we have it here at
Washington and Lee despite the

economic downturn. Other col-'

leges are not so lucky and we
should be really happy we are so
privileged.

I graduated this May from
Brandeis University, a Jew-
ish-sponsored college located
in Waltham, Mass. There are
many reasons why Brandeis is

 

experiencing the full impact of
the economic crisis. Since the
university is only 61 years old,
Brandeis cannot rely on donors
due to the fact that its alumni
base is both young and small in
comparison to peer institutions.
Furthermore, this situation has
led the university to rely heavily
on its endowment, but because of

All of these conditions dras-
tically affected how the school
operated this past year. Several
stations in the dining hall closed
and meal options were cut in
order to slash operating costs.
Furthermore, our golf and swim
teams were suspended and nec-
essary repairs on the university’s
swimming pool have been halted

All told, countless schools across the nation

are cutting programs and staff in order to

deal with the damagingieconomic crises.

 

the ﬁnancial crisis, the dividends
derived from these investments
have decreased markedly.

Since Brandeis is Jewish-
sponsored, it has historically re-
lied on the ﬁnancial support of

-the American Jewish community.

Because of the Madoff scandal,
many Jewish philanthropists ﬁnd
themselves without expendable
money and this has further hurt
the institution’s ability to fund-
raise.

indeﬁnitely. Operating hours at
the library, gym and dining fa-
cilities have been shortened and
programming money for various
activities were capped.

Almost all holiday parties last
Christmas were cancelled and, in
order to save money, the univer-
sity even tried to take away paper
towels from bathrooms that have
electric hand dryers. Further-
more, Brandeis has decided to
increase its enrollment consid-

erably in order to receive more
tuition money and will begin
requiring students to spend a se-
mester away from the university
in order to facilitate this growth.

The changes don’t stop there.
The Bernstein scholarships,
funds designed to bring excep-

4 tional musicians to campus, have

been suspended indeﬁnitely. Ad-
ditionally, the number of PhD.
students at the university has
been reduced because of the cost
associated with having these
scholars in residence.

Also, contributions to retire-
ment funds have been halted,
new hiring has ceased and other
measures have been taken to nar-
row the impending budget gap
that the university now faces.
Perhaps the most drastic and
most widely advertised endeavor
to reach ﬁnancial solvency was
attempted when the university
tried to close down its campus
art museum and sell the artwork
valued at roughly $400 million.
After experiencing huge national
pressure and even lawsuits from
various donors, this action was
not taken. Nevertheless, attempt-
ing to take this monumental step
indicates the desperate ﬁnancial

condition in which Brandeis cur-
rently ﬁnds itself.

The economic crisis has af-
fected not only my beloved alma
mater, but schools across the
country. The University of Cali-
fornia is now in the process of
implementing tuition increases,
lay-offs and furloughs in or-
der to work themselves “into
the black.” Mount Holyoke has
stopped serving hot breakfasts
in order to save money. LSU,
Dartmouth and countless other
schools are all laying off staff
workers in order to balance their
smaller budgets and reach ﬁnan-
cial solvency.

Countless schools across the
nation are cutting programs and
staff in order to deal with the
damaging economic crises.

Now, I have not been at this
university long enough to notice
any appreciable differences in
how the institution has been op-
erating since the ﬁnancial slow-
down.

What I can see is that relative
to other schools, we have it pretty
good here at W&L. For instance,
there is still money to keep the
lawns green and well-manicured,
a luxury that has been sacriﬁced

With no consent,

rape is rape

Some see gray areas, but Karcher thinks this
attitude prompts rape victims to blame themselves

Washington and Lee is
known for its “work hard, play
hard culture.” Students dedi-
cate time to their classroom
studies, knowing that when
their work is done there will
be plenty of parties to choose
from on any given Wednesday,
Friday or Saturday. Of course,
party at W&L is synonymous
with alcohol—and lots of it.

The prevalence of alcohol
at parties means that alcohol is
also involved with most hook-

sires very clear and told him
she did not want their hookup
to proceed to sex. Her date
agreed, and they kept going.
Not long after, he pushed her
down, climbed on top of her
and started to have sex with
her. Alicia said “no” again and
told him to stop, but he ignored
her and eventually she gave up
and let him ﬁnish.

Afterwards, Alicia felt like
she had been raped—she had
not given consent and had told

Stepp deﬁnes “gray rape” as something

between consent and denial, something

not easily deﬁned. For me, rape is unde-

. niably black and white... if any person

has sex with another person against that

person is will... it is rape.

ups taking place between stu-
dents. Alcohol fuels many of
these hookups and leads to a
lot of ambiguous situations in
the process.

Devotees of Cosmopolitan
may have read a recent article
where in which writer Laura
Sessions Stepp outlines the so-
called growing trend of “gray
rape” among young men and
women. She told numerous
stories of hookups after late
night parties, and I immedi-
ately thought of W&L.

There was just one prob-
lem: the situations and read-
ers’ stories Stepp shared all
sounded like full-ﬂedged, un-
deniable rape to me.

She describes sorority girl
“Alicia,” who, after her for-
mal, wandered back to her
date’s room where they started
to make out. She made her de-

him “no” and “stop” out loud
more than once.

She wasn’t sure, however,
whether other people would
perceive it as “real” rape, es-
pecially since she had been
drinking and agreed to go back
to his room in the ﬁrst place.
In her eyes, it fell into a gray
area, because she thought she
should have done more to stop
the rape from happening.

Stepp deﬁnes “gray rape”
as something between consent
and denial, something not eas-
ily deﬁned.

For me, rape is undeni-
ably black and white. Under
Virginia law, if any person
has sex with another person
against that person’s will using
“force, threat or intimidation,”

. or if the person is “mentally

incapacitated or
helpless,” it is rape.

physically

What many W&L students
don’t realize is that “mentally
incapacitated” includes drunk
and blackout. Heavy drinking
at W&L is a huge part of the
reason why our sexual assault
and rape rates are twice the
national average. And, unfor-
tunately, these ideas of “gray
rape” and using alcohol as an
excuse are why our numbers
of rape and assaults that are
actually reported are so abys-
mally low.

Relying on this idea of gray
rape is likely to lead a lot of
actual rape survivors, like
Alicia, to blame themselves
and say, “if only I had less to
drink” or “if only I didn’t go
back with him to his room,”
rather than acknowledge that
they did not give consent to
sex and their partner had sex
with them anyway.

This happens far too often
on our campus, and the idea of
gray rape, especially involv-
ing alcohol, is used to excuse
away countless rape and sexu-
al assault situations.

Other crimes never seem to
be as murky. When someone
murders a person or steals a
car while intoxicated, being
drunk is never an excuse. I’ve
certainly never heard the term
gray murder or gray robbery.
Why is sexual assault any dif-
ferent?

END IT.

by many other institutions. In ad-
dition, there is free food at many
campus events such as movies
in the Stackhouse theatre, and
all the facilities seem well-kept.
All told, this institution is enjoy-
ing the luxuries forgone by many
other universities and we should
truly be thankful for this situa-
tion.

I am not saying that things
haven’t changed at all here as a
result of the ﬁnancial crisis, nor
that this school has not made sac-
riﬁces due to budget shortfalls.
What I am saying is that, from
my experience, we have it pretty
good here at W&L.

Overall, I just thought I would
illuminate this fact and describe
the problems experienced by
other universities around the
country. By noting this, I hope
that we can all better cherish the
luxuries and comforts we enjoy
here at W&L.

What happened to “Hello?”

W&L is cherished speaking tradition is sadly dying

Hi, there! Haven’t seen you in a
while, but I’ve got to run to class.
It’s in Wilson, so I’ve got a hike
ahead of me. See you around.

Now, that wasn’t so hard, was
it? I can’t help but feel that the
Speaking Tradition here at W&L
is dying. Until recently, I’ve been
responded to amicably by most ev-
ery student and professor I’ve said
hello to on campus, and that’s over
the course of over three full years.
Just a simple “How’s it goin’?” or
a maybe a “Hey, Strock” (or what-
ever your name happened to be)
was all that it took, and I’d get a
similar response, if not a deeper
conversation. Either was ﬁne with
me.

A few weeks ago, though, I was
stricken with a cold so bad that it
made it nearly impossible for me

to talk. Nevermind the difﬁculty »

it presented in keeping up in—class
participation grades. I wasn’t
able to say hello to people. But I
had a solution: I’d wave, smile
and mouth a greeting in response
to people. This solution didn’t

work, thoughmit never even had a
chance. I discovered that, with the
exception of people that I knew
fairly well, people wouldn’t speak
to me. I would walk to classes,
meals in the dining hall and to my
room in Gaines without h.earing a
simple hello. I wouldn’t even get a
wave or a nod. Nothing.

Now, this was no scientiﬁc ex-
periment—nor an experiment at
all. But when I got my voice back,
I asked a few of my friends if they
had noticed this, and they had.
They said it’s been like this for a
while. One friend—a fellow senior
—remarked that she had recently
said hello to someone who, instead
of being cordial in any way, just
stared at her like she was some
sort of mutant. This shouldn’t be
happening.

In his 1995 Inaugural Address,
University President John Elrod re-
marked on the speaking tradition:
“It is a simple act but one whose
meaning and value we should not
underestimate. A greeting can be
a phony gesture concealing indif-

ference or disdain, but it can also
express genuineness, warmth, con-
cern, delight. Our daily greetings
should reﬂect the commitment that
we will not be strangers to each
other; that we will know and care
for each other as friends and not as
strangers.”

It’s simple: it’s the same respect
and civility that pervade the honor
system that drive the speakipg tra-
dition. It’s nice to not be strangers
with everyone else in class. I un-
derstand that a lot of students here
go to parties to meet people—~it
makes sense. But there’s no reason
why you can’t meet someone for
the ﬁrst time when you’re wait-
ing in the halls of the C-School or
in line at the Co-op. For a school
whose student body puts so much
emphasis on having social connec-
tions, it seems ironic that so many
of us won’t even say hello.

The generation that cares

Abel Delgado takes a proper look at our generation

Dear Editor,

I realize the underlying silli-
ness of a columnist writing a letter

to the editor in regards to a piece I

his own opinions editor wrote, but
I believe Stockton Bullitt has once
again written an op-ed worth a re-
sponse. With all due respect, Mr.
Bullitt’s argument has so many
holes in it, I am have trouble de-
ciding which one to drive through
ﬁrst. I ﬁgure the headline is as a
good a place as any.

My ﬁrst reaction to being la-
beled part of the “we just don’t
care” generation was the prover-
bial “what the —?“. First problem
is with the “we.” Not only does
it attempt to stereotype an entire
generation but, Mr. Bullitt also
manages to completely misrepre-
sent what a generation constitutes.

A generation is not people
born within a four year period, my
friend. Our generation does end

‘ around 1992 but it also begins in

the late 70s. “Generation ADDer-
all,” as he refers to us, already has
two ﬁtting names, “Generation Y
“and “The September 11th Gen-
eration,” since the last members

of our generation were still old
enough to understand what was
happening on that day in 2001. It’s
also highly doubtful that the brunt
of mass media marketing would be
geared toward a group of people
who born just four years apart. I’m
pretty sure every advertising ex-
ecutive still cares about the 18-40
age group regardless of what exact
year people were born.

But the most disturbing aspect
of Bullit’s article is the prepos-
terous idea that our generation
doesn’-t care about things. If any-
thing, our generation cares about
actual important matters and there-
fore doesn’t sweat the small stuff
mentioned in his article.

If anything, it is the generations
before us that didn’t care. They
voted in low numbers. They bor-
rowed money against our future.
They also did their best to com-
pletely mess up the environment.
We will carry the burden of their
mistakes, but many of the solutions
for those mistakes have come, and
will continue to come, from our
generation. C

We are also a generation that has
bravely fought two wars. Whether

you’re like me and believe they
are wars of liberation, or like oth-
ers and believe they were wars
of choice, you should recognize
that mostly older men in Wash-
ington sent mostly younger men
and women into harrn’s way. The
men and women of our generation
who serve have done so with great
courage and care and just because
we don’t see them around campus.
that doesn’t mean they don’t rep-
resent our generation as much as

/we do.

Our generation faces greater
challenges than any generation
since the Great Generation that
grew up during the Great Depres-
sion and fought World War II. With
ballooning debt, climate change
and inept politicians on both sides
that claim to be~but really aren’t—
part of our generation, we have a
lot of messes to clean up.

If Mr. Bullitt were to look
around campus, he would see we
already started the cleanup process.
Obviously, we really do care.

 Unique play pushes the envelope  

Edgy play directed by senior Marquita Robinson brings lesbians, sex to W&L to Keller Theatre stage

By Anthony Ballor
STAFF WRITER

Lesbians, pot and incest, oh
my!

This year’s Floumoy Play-
wright Festival features “Where
We’re Born,” a play by Lucy
Thurber that focuses on life in a
small, working-class town where
“family relationships are main-
tained by a delicate balance be-
tween desire and dependency.”

Thurber is an acclaimed au-
thor whose plays have been
workshopped and staged by
several nationally acclaimed
companies, including the Man-
hattan Theatre Club, William-
stown, Rattlestick’s Playwrights
Theater and the Atlantic Theater
Company.

In “Where We’re Born,” Lilly
(played by senior Jenna Wor-
sham) returns from college to her
small, rural hometown in Mas-
sachusetts, where her cousin,
Tony (senior Brian Devine), his
girlfriend Franky (senior Melissa
Szumlic) and their friends Vin
(junior Dave Curran) and Drew
(junior Johnny Coyle) await her.

Lilly’s life before college was
decidedly fractured: due to an
unpleasant relationship with her
mother, she depended on Tony
to shelter her from other stu-
dents who made fun of her intel-
ligence.

Her homecoming is com-
pletely alienating and nontradi-

tional. Senior Marquita Robin-
son is directing the play for her
theater thesis.

“Lilly’s journey is a struggle
to reconcile two worlds,” Robin-
son said. “While her classmates
are probably greeted at home
with cookies and homemade
sweaters, Lilly comes home to a
can of beer and a cigarette.”

Lilly’s return causes chaos
in the lives of her cousin Tony
and his girlfriend Franky, whose
relationship is made tense by
Tony’s repeated philandering and
Franky’s feelings of abandon-
ment. Lilly falls into the middle
of this situation.

Fueled by both alcohol and

marijuana, Lilly .and Franky
sleep together and then begin a
loving but secretive lesbian rela-
tionship. When Tony discovers
the truth and violently confronts
Lilly, they too give in to their
passion for each other, creating
a love triangle which culminates
in the destruction of both of the
relationships.

“Where We’re Born” is an
unconventional, unsettling play,
and the natural question to ask
would be why such a production
was chosen and if the theater de-
partment expect students to at-
tend it. "

“When you take a look at why
theater exists in our society in

the ﬁrst place... it gives us per-
mission to look into the lives of
others. . .Audiences want to leave
the theater changed and enlight-
ened,” Robinson said.

“To say that a play like
‘Where We’re Born’ is not rel-
evant to W&L students is to say
that the struggles of human life
are not relevant to us,” she said.

While most students at W&L
may not have a personal connec-
tion to the world in the play, it
may be for this reason why we
should attend the performance:
to help us to understand the lives
of others. Consider attending
such a well-written, moving play
to be part of your cultural educa-

tion.

“Where We’re Born” is part
of the Floumoy Playwright
Festival, which includes perfor-
mances of this work Nov. 5-7 at
7:30 p.m. in the Keller Theatre as
well as a special reading of Lucy
Thurber’s play “Scarcity,” di-
rected by Rob Mish, which will
take place on Nov. 7 at 3 p.m. in
the Johnson Theatre.

There will be talkbacks fol-
lowing each performance of
“Where We’re Born,” featuring
Thurber and several other mod-
erators, including 2009 graduate
Melissa Caron and Professors
Mayock, Ristau and Radulescu.

Bonding with parents: beer pong  

Annual tournament inspires quality father-son time through the time-honored medium of competitive teamwork

By Findley Merrltt
STAFF WRITER

The age-old image of fa-
thers coaching their sons to play
America’s favorite pastime takes
on a whole new meaning during
Parents Weekend.

There is no better example of
this phenomenon than Pi Kappa
Alpha’s annual father-son beer
pong tournament. And it’s an
excuse for parents to relive their
college days.

The tournament has been a
standing tradition for four or ﬁve
years, said senior Pika member

Adam Cancryn.

More speciﬁcally, it’s been
around as long as fraternity
members have resided in 108
East Henry Street.

Every Parents Weekend, par-
ents rush out to the house known
as “Velva” on Friday to either
brush up on their skills or play
for the ﬁrst time.

“It lasts until they ﬁnd a win-
ner or the cops come,” Cancryn
said.

The event is surprisingly or-

ganized given the nature of the
tournament.

The night before, the frater-
nity creates a list of all the mem-
bers, parents and freshmen who
want to play.

That information is organized
into brackets and assigned to
three different pong tables.

The winner is announced af-

Generals face tough Week, seniorday loss

The men ’s soccer team dropped a 3-] loss to Eastern Mennonite on -Wednesday before falling 1-0 to Hampden Sydney on Saturday

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

When you commit to play on a var-
sity college team for four years, there
is one game you always hope you win:
senior day. But that ﬁnal home victory
is something the three seniors on the
Washington and Lee men’s soccer team
will just have to live without.

_ The Generals fell, 1-0, to Hampden
Sydney on senior day this Saturday. The
Generals’ defense was able to hold off
the Tigers until the 34th minute, but
Hampden Sydney needed only one goal
to close out the victory.

The Tigers outshot the Generals 13-
11 and controlled the momentum for the
majority of the game. W&L goalkeeper
sophomore Alex Lambert played all

A 90:00 minutes and recorded four saves

against the one goal.
“We were unlucky,” said senior cap-

Saturday's 1-0 loss to Hampden Sydney

tain Drew Crowley. “But we played a
great game and kept ﬁghting.”

The men’s soccer team has had a
rough couple of weeks. Coming off a
1-0 loss to Roanoke over Homecoming
weekend, the Generals rebounded with
a much-needed 2-0 win over Emory
and Henry. Junior midﬁelder Ben Belair
contributed an unassisted goal and soph-
omore midﬁelder James Paldino scored
off an assist from Crowley. Junior goal-
keeper Ben Bartlett played all 90:00 for
the Generals and earned one save in the
shutout.

The Generals came close to another
win facing off against Ferrum Oct. 18,
but couldn’t close out the victory, end-
ing the game in a 0-0 tie. They then
dropped a 3-1 loss to Eastern Menno-
nite last Wednesday. The Generals’ sole

goal in the loss came from Crowley off
an assist by ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Collier
Wiseman.

Two losses, one tie and the lone win
over Emory and Henry have dropped
the Generals to 4-6-4 overall and 2-5-
2 in conference play. But the Generals
remain optimistic as they head into tour-
nament play.

“It’s been really frustrating because
all season long we have proven that we
can play with any team in our confer-
ence,” Bartlett said. “We just haven’t
been able to get the results. No matter
how tough the loss, we’ve kept our head
up and kept ﬁghting. Right now we are
focused on making the playoffs because
we know we can do some damage.”

Women’s soccer continues to shine with defens'we dominance

The Lady Generals have recorded 12 total shutouts on the season and only one loss as they look ahead to the ODAC tournament

By Adam cancryn
s TA F F w R IT E R

Finding the back of the net is often
the result of good timing and offensive
skill. But against the Generals this year,
scoring a goal is more like a stroke of
luck.

Anchored by its back line, the W&L
women’s soccer team, which is 13-1-2
and 8-0-2 in the ODAC, has turned its
matches into a study of frustration and
futility. They have allowed goals to just
three opponents this season, with last
week’s victories over Emory & Henry
and Ferrum giving the 21st-ranked Gen-
erals 12 total shutouts.

The key to such defensive dominance
begins in the middle. Senior midﬁelder
Maggie Sutherland and sophomore cen-
ter back Corinne Smith direct the action,
locking down their opponent’s best strik-
er while keeping W&L’s bevy of skilled
defenders synchronized. They are com-
plemented by a rotation of at least seven
different backs and defensive midﬁeld-
ers, a luxury of interchangeability that
coach Neil Cunningham has utilized to
keep his players fresh and focused.

The result is something similar to
watching Forrest Gump play ping-pong:
attack after attack is calmly yet abruptly
turned away, the back line working with
a ﬂuidity of motion that belies its ma-
chinelike efﬁciency, until the opponent
tires of the fruitless back-and-forth, giv-
ing the Generals a swift counter-attack
opportunity before dropping back into
their defensive shell.

It is a system that has come to rely
more on solid fundamentals and risk
management than sheer talent. Each
player recognizes their role in a strat-
egy that forces opposing forwards into
double teams and takes away the middle
of the pitch, eliminating high percentage
shots.

Cunningham’s tactics and the team’s
execution have produced the Generals’
best defensive season since 2006, when
the Generals gave up just three goals
en route to ﬁnishing atop the ODAC.
Through 16 games this year, opponents
have taken 103 shot attempts, an average
of just 6.4 per game. Of those attempts,

only 42 were put on goal. By compari-
son, W&L has more than tripled those
statistics, averaging 21.2 shot attempts
per game while putting 160 of their 339
shots on goal. J

Stout defense has also provided
time for the offense to gel. On track
to score less than 50 goals for the ﬁrst
time since 2001, W&L lacks the go-to
scorer they’ve relied on so heavily in
the past. But a lack of consistency has
been remedied through quantity. First-
years Ainsley Daigle, Katie Howard and
Hannah Sackﬁeld have stepped in ably
and bolstered the Generals’ speedy of-
fensive corps. As of press time, 11 dif-
ferent players had scored at least twice,
a consequence of an opportunistic style
of play that turns turnovers into high-
percentage counter-attacks.

However, even the most efﬁcient ma-
chines can break down. And in one of
the country’s deepest conferences, one
slip-up can unravel a season’s worth
of work. Despite outshooting Guilford
33-4 and leading for most’ of Saturday’s

match, a 71st-minute equalizer forced
W&L to settle for a 1-1 tie. The draw,
coupled with Virginia Wesleyan’s win at
Hollins, dropped the Generals one point
out of ﬁrst place in the ODAC as of Oct.
26.

Virginia Wesleyan has now won 10
straight games since losing to W&L on
Sept. 19, giving them a conference-lead-
ing 27 points on the season.

With the ODAC Tournament set to
kick off this Saturday, the Generals have
likely lost out on a No. 1 seed. But based
on past history, seeding means little once
the games begin.

Though W&L’s defense brings to

mind that of the ’06 team, that’s where —

the players hope the similarities stop.
Despite going undefeated in conference
play that year, the Generals’ ODAC
championship hopes ﬂamed out in the
semiﬁnals with a 1-0 loss to Virginia
Wesleyan.

This time, tournament success de-
pends on the steady play of the expe-
rienced back line. Having allowed all

seven goals this year in the second half,
it will fall to Smith and Sutherland to

keep the defense focused throughout the ,

entire match.

Given time to ﬁnd its footing, W&L’s
offense can create chances around the
net, where the team has made the most
of its opportunities. Despite the drop in
total goals scored, the Generals are still
capitalizing on their chances, ﬁnding the
net nearly once out of every two shots
on goal.

As long as W&L does not have to rely
on the offense to play catch-up, the team
has a good chance to break its ODAC
championship drought. They dealt Vir-
ginia Wesleyan their only conference
loss, stymied Lynchburg’s dangerous
scorers and have not lost to Bridgewa—
ter in nine years. The Generals might
not have the ﬁrepower of years past, but
if the defense comes out focused, they
won’t need it.

Last minute drive gives Generals a 28-21 win over Guilford

Football improves to 3-5, 2-2 ODAC with a 28-21 victory over Guilford last Saturday

By Ted Moore

' STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee secured a 28-21
ODAC victory over Guilford last Satur-
day after sophomore quarterback Char-
lie Westfal ran for a 21-yard touchdown
late in the fourth quarter.

The Generals led the Quakers, who
are 1-6, 0-3 ODAC, with the halftime
score at 14-0. This was following a pair
of scores from sophomores Harrison
Hudson on an 18-yard pass from Westfal
and Johnathan Clemo on a two-yard run.
However, mistakes in the second half let
Guilford back in the game. The Quakers
capitalized on three Generals turnovers,
scoring 21 points in the second half.

“Offensively and especially person-

ally, we made too many major mistakes,
turning the ball over and giving the oth-
er team a short ﬁeld,” Westfal said. “The
defense played really well, though.”

Westfal was intercepted on the Gen-
erals’ ﬁrst play of the third quarter. A
two-yard touchdown run from Quakers’
quarterback Billy Watkins capped the
ensuing drive.

A Generals’ fumble gave the Quakers
the ball just 33 yards from the end zone
at the beginning of the fourth quarter. A
27-yard touchdown run from Quakers’
running back Mike Williams tied the
score at 14-14. ,

The Generals responded on the en-

suing kickoff with a 99-yard return for
a touchdown by sophomore linebacker
John Kavanagh.

“The kick was back to the goal line
and I saw some [green in front of me,”
said Kavanagh. “I made one or two peo-
ple miss, but other than that it was just
a great blocking scheme with everyone

, staying on their blocks.”

The Quakers tied the score at 21-21
with 6:26 remaining in the game, as
Quaker’s linebacker David LaPlaca re-
turned a General’s fumble 42 yards for
a touchdown.

Despite the frustration of three sec-
ond-half turnovers leading directly to

Quaker scores, a composed Westfal
led the Generals down the ﬁeld on the
game’s decisive drive. The Generals
compiled an eight-play, 70-yard drive
that resulted in Westfal’s 21-yard run
and put the Generals up by seven with
3:39 remaining. '

“The ﬁnal drive was us really com-
ing together and putting together a nice
string of plays,” said Wesfal.

In addition to his game-winning
touchdown on the ground, Westfal ﬁn-
ished the day with 95 yards through the
air, completing nine passes in 15 at-
tempts. Clemo and Hudson had 83 and
84 yards rushing, respectively, as the

“Playoffs? Don’t talk about playoffs.”

Columnist Drew Koeneman discusses the excessively long post—seasons in the NBA and NFL

By Drew Koeneman
c o L U M N IS T

As tried-and-true mass market teams
the New York Yankees and the Philadel-
phia Phillies prepare to face off in the
106th World Series, one might wonder
the basic question: who cares?

The answer: over 20 million people,
which has been the average TV audi-
ence per game of the fall baseball classic
since the year 2000. The World Series
will beat this fall’s series premieres of
Sunday Night Football (18.2 million)
and Grey’s Anatomy (17.1 million), two
of the nation’s most watched shows

And all of this depends on one word:
playoffs.

The postseason of any major sport
team is undoubtedly the most exciting
time of the season. After all the hard
work and early morning practices, and
all the screaming and bratwurst grill-
ing by the fans, the whole season comes
down to one game, one moment, one
play-—or in some cases, two months.

The 2009 NBA playoffs, which lasted
from April 18 to June 14, and the NHL’s
Stanley Cup Playoffs, which lasted from"
April 16 to June 12, were the two most
unnecessarily long months of the sports
year. In both the NBA and NHL, where

30 teams compete over a long season,
16 teams earn the right to compete in
the playoffs. Not only does this make
each regular season game less and less
meaningful, but it takes away excite-
ment from the playoffs. In the NBA and
NHL playoff systems, teams compete in
four rounds, each consisting of a best-
of-seven series. This creates the possi-
bility for a single team to play 28 games
in the playoffs. With so many games,
the playoff atmosphere is often dull and
drawn-out. Teams try to salvage some
excitement in the championship series,
but unfortunately usually fail.

There is a reason why the Super
Bowl is the most-watched sporting
event in America, with 98.7 million
Viewers huddled around TVs last win-
ter to watch Santonio Holmes squander
any hope for the Arizona Cardinals’ ﬁrst
Super Bowl victory. That is because
the NFL playoffs are set up in a way to
make it exciting.

The NFL playoffs, the most-watched
playoffs in America, are the ideal sys-
tem. Throughout the season, the 32
teams of the NFL battle day after day
on the gridiron for the highly coveted 12

playoff spots. I would not have wanted
to be the one to tell Bill Belichick that
his Patriots were not good enough to
make the 2008-2009 playoffs with a ll-
5 record.

With only one game per round, the
four rounds of the NFL playoffs seem
to ﬂy by, lasting only a mere 29 days in
2009. Not only does that carry the open-
ing round excitement all the way to the
grand ﬁnale of the Super Bowl, but the
proclivity for upsets to happen through-
out the playoffs adds the excitement that
is lacking in the opening rounds of the
NBA and NHL.

No one wants to watch bad teams get
creamed by NBA all-stars. But in the
NBA, higher-ranked teams often embar-
rass inferior opponents who probably
shouldn’t have gotten in to the playoffs
in the ﬁrst place. There are rarely good

. matchups in the opening rounds. In the

ﬁrst round of the 2009 NBA playoffs,
which were watched only by an aver-
age of 2.9 million people per game,
only two out of the eight series went to
seven games. In the case of four out of
the eight series, the higher-ranked team
won 4-1 or 4-0. In the NHL, where sadly

only 0.4 million people tuned in each

A ﬁrst round game, it was a similar story.

Where is the excitement? You need to
remember that people like underdogs. In
the ﬁrst round of this year’s NFL play-
offs, which were watched by an average
of 29.8 million people per game, not one
team with the better record won.

Now let’s not forget about America’s
pastime, baseball, whose playoff system
falls a close second behind the NFL’s.
Major Leagie Baseball playoffs, which
are the second most watched of any ma-
jor US sport, usually only last within
the month of October. This short time is
just enough to allow the excitement to
build throughout the month. The MLB
has done it right; with only eight teams
making the playoffs, everyone is good,
and anyone can win. And that is what
people want to watch.

The ﬁrst round of the MLB playoffs
are only a best-of-ﬁve series, which not
only speeds up the playoffs, but also adds
to the unpredictable nature of the series.
Looking back a couple weeks, not too
many people would have thought that
the St. Louis Cardinals and Boston Red
Sox would be heading to the golf course

running game continues to be a focus
for the Generals’ attack.

The Generals’ defense was led by se-
nior linebacker Gus Cavanaugh and se-
nior safety Donovon Sawyer, who each
recorded nine tackles. Junior comerback
David Stemlicht contributed eight tack-
les in addition to two pass-breakups and
a forced fumble.

The Quakers ﬁnished with 338 yards
of total offense, passing for 209 yards
and rushing for 129.

W&L will next host the Bridgewa-
ter Eagles (5-2, 2-1 ODAC) Saturday at
1:00 in the General’s last home game of
the season.

after getting swept in three games.

Compare that to the NBA, where no
teams in the bottom half of the 16 have
ever advanced past the second round
of the playoffs since the playoff format
moved to 16 teams in 1984.

Where is the incentive to watch when
you know what is going to happen? This
is why only 13.4 million fans are sticking
around to watch the NBA ﬁnals: there is
no excitement at the start of the playoffs
and by the time NBA ﬁnals have ﬁnally
rolled around, the two months of wait-
ing has hurt interest.

Unfortunately, the annoyingly long
and uneventful playoff systems of the
NBA and NHL will not change due to
media contracts and having to pay the
ridiculously high player salaries. We
will all just have to accept the fact that
this is the way it is. Let me know when
the fourth quarter of game seven of the
NBA ﬁnals is on; maybe I’ll watch.

Volleyball on 12-game Winning streak after Weekend Victories

The Generals defeated Bridgewater, 3-1, and Marietta, 3-1, to improve to I 7-

By Llzz Dye
smrr wmnzn

The Washington and Lee volleyball
team extended its winning streak to 12
with a 3-1 victory over Bridgewater and
a 3-1 victory over Marietta on Saturday.
The wins brought the Generals to a 17-
10 overall record and a 7-2 conference
record.

The winning streak ﬁrst started with
the Generals 3-2 defeat of Lynchburg.
Since then W&L has dropped only ﬁve
games, earning a 33-5 advantage over
their opponents.

“We struggled earlier this year with
some ODAC teams, but have really hit
our stride and are playing quality vol-
leybal1,” said sophomore hitter Megan
Daily. “We have gotten some help from
some teams losing and now are in a po-
sition to control our destiny. If we win
out, we can ﬁnish second and have a
great seed going into the tournament.”

The Generals took their streak into
full force when they notched two shut-
outs in 3-0 victories over Sweet Briar
and Guilford.

Against Sweet Briar, junior middle
blocker Louise Brooks led the oﬁ°ense
with seven kills, followed by senior out-
side hitter Rachael Phillips with six kills
and six digs. First-year libero Cameron
Hill also contributed 12 digs and three
service aces to the victory.

Two days later against Guilford,
Brooks and Phillips again led the charge
for the Generals. Phillips posted in the
double-digits with 12 kills while Brooks
added 8 kills.

A 3-2 win over Christopher Newport
was sweet revenge for the Generals,
who lost to them earlier in the season,
3-0. Brooks led the offense with 20 kills,
followed by Phillips with 16 kills. Daily
also added 11 kills.

Senior setter Kristi Stevens regis-
tered 50 assists in the game and tied for
a team high with 13 digs.

“The Christopher Newport game
was a big match,” Daily said. “They
are always a good team and every year
is competitive. We lost a rough one last
year and one earlier in the year, but we
didn’t focus on past losses. We stuck
with our philosophy and game plan, and
were able to beat a good team.”

The Generals next faced Roanoke
,and again came out victorious with a
3-0 sweep. This was the second time in
eight days that W&L defeated the Ma-
roons. Philips showed a strong offensive
front again with 13 kills while hitting
.433. Brooks added 9 kills and hit .500
for the match. Stevens led the team with
28 assists and 14 digs, while Hill added
an impressive 11 digs and a pair of ser-
vice aces.

The Generals continued to dominate
as they took on Mary Baldwin. Hill led
W&L with 20 digs, complemented by
13 digs from Stevens. Junior Marah
Schmitz drove the offensive with 11
kills and junior Summer Goldberg add-
ed an impressive four service aces along
with four digs.

With 10 straight wins behind them,
the Generals were conﬁdent and poised
heading in to their weekend match-ups
against Bridgewater and Marietta.

Taking down ODAC foe Bridge-
water, the tandem duo of Philips and
Brooks was at it again. Philips led with
16 kills while Brooks put up 12.

Daily and ﬁrst-year right-side Bailey

Walker added eight kills apiece. Hill led
the Generals with 15 digs, while Phillips
and defensive specialist Jenna Finger
contributed 12 digs each.

In their second match of the day
against Marietta, the Generals showed
no signs of slowing down. Brooks and
Philips again led the way with. double-
digit stats. Philips posted 19 kills and
Brooks added 11 to give the "two 30 total
kills for the game.

Philips and Brooks had a combined
58 kills for the weekend. Senior setter
Megan Steinhardt added 48 assists to
the offensive effort.

With the Generals’ recent success,
Head Coach Brian Snyder has every
reason to be smiling.

“All of those matches were big
for us to continue to play well and im-
prove, which has been our goal in each
match this season,” Snyder said. “[The
win over Christopher Newport] was
big since we had lost to them earlier in
the year, so that gives us a lot of posi-
tive reinforcement that the time we have
spent in the gym trying to get better has
played off”

Snyder already has his sights on
ODAC tournament play and believes
that his team has a chance to make a real
run in the tournament.

“In general, we need to have great
effort on defense, make smart decisions
on offense, and serve and pass the ball
well,” he said. “If we do those things on
a consistent basis, I think we can beat
any of the teams that we might face the
rest of the season.”

But Snyder is cautious not to look
too far ahead.

“As for the ODAC tournament, I
think we just need to keep working to
get better every day until we get there,”
he said. “We have improved a great deal
this year, but we still have two weeks
and ﬁve regular season matches to play
before we get there, so we are just going
to focus on using those opportunities to
improve as individuals and as a team.
Once we know who our opponents will
be in the tournament, we will begin to
prepare for them.”

Don’t expect them to break out into
song and dance during practice, but the
Washington and Lee men’s basketball
team has their head in the game.

Last year, the Generals overcame a
mid-season slump and ﬁve-game los-
ing streak to make a run to the ODAC
Championship game and post a 16-13
record, marking the ﬁrst time in 20 years
the Generals have earned back-to-back
winning seasons. As the team prepares
for their season opener, they aren’t wast-
ing any time getting back into a winning
mindset.

“We had a great year last year,” said
junior guard Jason Cimino. “We had six
seniors who really didn’t want to lose
and made a run for the championship in
the ODAC tournament... We learned a
lot. A lot about focus, and that every day
means something. You can’t ever take

days off You can’t relax at all.”

As head coach Adam Hutchinson
begins his seventh season at W&L and
seeks to build on his 55 career wins, all
he asks for is the very best his team can
give.

“We’ve got to understand it’s got to
be every guy, every game, 100 percent
focused,” Hutchinson said. “I think one
of the lessons we learned last year was
that you can’t be 96 percent in today and
expect to do well. It’s got to be 100 per-
cent.” .

That’s the kind of work ethic that got
the Generals to the ODAC Champion-
ship last year, and the players are look-
ing to keep the tradition of hard work and
preparation alive. The team graduated
six seniors last year, but a new batch of
upperclassmen leaders and freshman up-
starts is eager and ready to ﬁll the void.

“The loss of one person is an oppor-
tunity for somebody else,” Hutchinson
said. “Those guys graduated, so it opens
up playing time for every guy who’s
looking for an opportunity to prove
themselves.”

The Generals will return co-captains
senior forwards Ben Goetsch and Zach
White, the third and fourth leading scor-
ers respectively for the Generals last
year.

“I’m trying to take a big leadership
role,” White said. “We’re a young team
and we need everyone to step up and
show the way. We’re trying to build
more leaders for the next year and the
year after that.”

Hutchinson also cited the leadership
qualities of Cimino.

“[He] has begun showing leadership
in terms of executing, knowing what he ’s

said. “It’s very encouraging.”

Other returners for the Generals are
sophomores Jonathan Guest, Will Smith
and Kyle Bond.. Returning players will
also receive support from a talented
ﬁrst-year class looking-to make a serious
impact in their ﬁrst season at W&L.

“[The ﬁrst-years] are good,” Cimino
said. “We only have six returners so
they’re going to play a huge role. And I
think they’re ready. They’re very talent-
ed and they’re very deep, very athletic.
They’re working hard; they’re learning
everything. We’re expecting a lot out of
them.” ' _

Field hockey dominates competition in five straight shutouts

The Generals haven ’t dropped a point since falling 6-0 to Eastern Mennonite on October 7

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The ﬁeld hockey team is on a roll.
W&L has posted a ﬁve-game winning
streak and pushed its overall record to
9-6 and 5-2 in conference play. The
General’s recent wins haven’t just been
victories, they’ve been dominations.

Over the past two weeks, the Gener-
als have beaten Roanoke, Rhodes, Se-
wanee, and Virginia Wesleyan by scores
of 7-0, 1-0, 3-0, and 6-0 respectively.
Add the game prior to Roanoke, a 5-0
win over Bridgewater, and the Generals
have a ﬁve game shutout streak going.
Date back even further to the Eastern
Mennonite game and the Generals have
not allowed a goal in a little over 360
minutes.

Facing off against Roanoke Col-
lege on their home ﬁeld, senior forward
and W&L career goal leader Sallie
Armstrong opened the scoring for the
Generals off an assist from sophomore

forward Christina Benedetti fewer than

three minutes into the game.

Junior defender Kelly Tran and se-
nior forward Steph Mansey closed out
the half with two unassisted goals to give
W&L a 3-0 lead going into the break.
Roanoke could do nothing but watch as

the Generals sealed the deal with four

more goals from Armstrong, sophomore
defender Susie Giampalmo, and two
from ﬁrst-year forward Katherine Price.
When the dust settled, the Generals had
scored seven goals and ﬁred 34 shots on
the Roanoke cage. Roanoke posted no
goal; no shots even made it through to
senior goalkeeper Caroline Habliston.
“It’s almost more nerve-wracking to
play in a game where there’s not a lot of

. action in the defensive circle,” Hablis-

ton said. “Getting caught daydreaming
becomes a prime opportunity for the
other team to score a fast-break goal.
My mindset is to treat every minute of
the game like the score is 0-0.”

The Generals’ next scheduled game
against St. Mary’s was rained out so the
team had to wait until next Sunday to
resume action.

Rhodes made the trip to face W&L
and gave the Generals a run for their
money. Seventy minutes of regulation
play was not enough to decide a win-
ner, so the game was sent into overtime
with the two teams deadlocked at 0-0.
A little over two minutes into overtime,
Armstrong scored the winner unassist-
ed, sending the Generals and their fans
into a frenzy. As evidenced by the score,
both teams played stiﬂing defense, with
W&L getting 12 shots on the cage and
Rhodes making only four.

The team looked to continue their hot
streak when they hosted Sewanee last
Tuesday. The Generals again blanked

' the opposition, garnering a 3-0 win.

Armstrong bookended the scoring for
the Generals, with Price also tallying a

goal.

Armstrong has seemingly put this
team on her back as the Generals rocket
towards postseason play. She has scored
eight goals in only six games.

“My teammates have just set me up
with some good shots, and I am able to
ﬁnish the play,” Armstrong said.

On Saturday, W&L made the long
trip to Virginia Beach to face Virginia
Wesleyan. Proving that they are just as
formidable on the road as they are at
home, the Generals wiped the ﬂoor with
VWC, winning 6-0. '

With yet another commanding tri-
umph, the team set a school record for
consecutive shutout victories. The scor-
ing in this one can be summed up as
the Armstrong, Benedetti and Mansey
show. Armstrong notched two goals and
an assist. Benedetti added a goal and an
assist and Mansey led the scoring with
three goals. She scored her third 58 min-

utes into the game to record the hat trick.
With such strong offense, the Generals’
defense was able to lock it down and

post yet another donut in the opponent’s,'

scoring column.
All recent signs point to success in
upcoming playoff action.

“Our passing and defense have im-
proved and with the way we have played
recently, we are really excited to start
postseason play,” Armstrong said.

W&L starts ODAC conference tour-
nament play this Saturday with the op-
ponent to be determined. With the way
Coach Orrison’s club is playing right
now a rematch against Lynchburg or
Eastern Mennonite looks to be inevita-
ble if the Generals want to win it all.

With wins and losses, W&L swimming kicks 0]?’ season to mixed reviews

The Washington and Lee pool is sud-
denly getting a lot more use. The men’s
and Women’s swim teams are back in sea-
son, kicking off their winter campaign with
meets against Mary Washington and Cen-
tre and the Women’s ODAC Fall Relays.

The teams traveled to Mary Washing-
ton for their ﬁrst meet of the year. Opti-
mism was high, but both teams fell behind
and gave the meet to Mary Washington.
The men lost by a score of 146-116 and the
women fell behind 180-82. But the Gener-
als did take home victories in six events.
Senior Nick Talluri won the 100 freestyle
with a time of 48.70, while fellow senior
Winston Stagg ﬁnished ﬁrst in the 200
breaststroke with a time of 2: 19.69. Soph-
omore Chris Washnock took ﬁrst place 200
backstroke at 1:57.09 and sophomore Jeff
Stirling claimed the 100 butterﬂy in 53.29.
First-year Rick Sykes saw his ﬁrst win
with the top place in the 50 freestyle with
a time of22. 14.

On the Women’s side, the 400 freestyle

‘relay team of seniors Sarah Simpson and

Jenna Worsham, sophomore Elizabeth
Stames and ﬁrst-year Izzy Brassﬁeld took
ﬁrst place with a time of 3:34.76. First-
year Brittany Ross also added points for
the Generals with a second place ﬁnish in
the 200m butterﬂy (2: 14.35).

It was a quick turn around for the Gen-
erals as they went right back into the pool
the next day to face off against Centre. The
men earned their ﬁrst victory of the season,
defeating Centre 134-109.

On the men’s side, the Generals took
ﬁrst place in nine events. Talluri, Wash-
nock, and senior Ian Childers led the
Generals with two individual event titles
apiece. Childers won the 100 breaststroke
(1204.32) and 200 breaststroke (2221.56).
Talluri claimed the 50 freestyle (22.08) and
the 100 freestyle (49.01). Washnock placed

ﬁrst in both the 100 backstroke (56.04) and.

200 backstroke (2100.44). Sophomore Ben
Absher won the 1000 freestyle (10:41.04),
Stagg won the 200 butterﬂy (2:02.83), and
junior Brandon Wilder took the 200 free-
style (1251.68). The relay team of ﬁrst year
Wayde Marsh, sophomore Brian Stirling,
Stagg and Talluri took the 200 medley re-
lay (1:40.48).

But it was a split ticket day for W&L
swimming and the women dropped their
second meet, falling 142-120. Four ﬁrst
place victories in individual events and a
winning relay team, however, helped offset
the loss. Ross took ﬁrst in the 200 butter-
ﬂy with a time of 2:18. 19. Stames won the
500 freestyle with a time of 5:40.43 and
fellow sophomore Katie Salvati touched
ﬁrst in the 200 backstroke with a time of
2:17.48. Worsham took the 200 IM with
a time of 2:20.10 and anchored the win-
ning 200 freestyle relay team that ﬁnished

with a time of 1:43.67. She was joined by
Simpson, sophomore Dana Fredericks and
Brassﬁeld.

The women7s team rebounded quickly
in the ODAC Fall Relays this past Satur-
day, claiming six of 10 events and posting a

score of 362 en route to victory. Fredericks
and Brassﬁeld were major contributors to
the team win. The two racked up the most
points for the Generals, each swimming
for four winning relay teams. Simpson,
Worsham and ﬁrst-year Megan Bock each
had a part in three winning teams. Fred-
ericks, Simpson, Brassﬁeld and Worsham
claimed the 200 freestyle relay with a time
of 1:43.09. Fredericks, Worsham and Bock
ﬁnished ﬁrst in the 300 3x100 IM relay
with a time of 3:16.84. Fredericks, Book
and senior Lynn Bazzel teamed up to win
the 150 yard breaststroke relay in 1:37.86.
Simpson, Brassﬁeld and Stames won the
400 freestyle relay at 3:49.08. Fredericks
and Brassﬁeld teamed up with Ross and
sophomore Brielle to take ﬁrst place in the
200 medley relay in 1:58.13. Brassﬁeld,
Bock, Simpson, Stames and Weinstein
combined with juniors Becky Guynn and
Rachel Mensch and sophomore Jocelyn
Cassada to take the 200 8x25 Relay with a
time of 1:42.47.

Looking ahead to the rest of the season,
both teams have high expectations of good

things to come.

In the 2009 pre-season polls, the wom-
en’s team was picked to win its third-con-
secutive conference title. Back for the
Generals are seven First Team All-ODAC
swimmers from last year including the

2008 Rookie of the Year, sophomore Eliza-
beth Stames.

“We will'have a young team this sea-
son, but we will not be short on talent,”
said Head.Women’s Coach Kami Gardner.

The men’s roster is loaded with depth
and experience and Head Coach Joel Shi-
noﬁeld will be looking for his team to
make big strides in the ODAC.

“We have a deep and all-around strong
team,” Shinoﬁeld said. “The team this year
is well-balanced and will be highly com-
petitive in all events.”

The men’s team will rely heavily on the
leadership of its eight seniors, particularly
All-America recipients Talluri and Bran-
don Bamds and First-Team All-Bluegrass
Mountain Conference honorees Dan Aus-
tin and Jonathan Giesen. Washnock, who
was recognized as the W&L Outstanding
First-Year Male Athlete last year, will look
to capitalize on his ﬁrst-year success with
a strong sophomore effort.

Both teams return to action this Satur-
day with a meet against Transylvania.

Collegiate team horse system a challenge

F irst-year rider Collier McLeod talks about the aajustment to college riding

By Becky Mlckel

‘STAFF WRITER

lt’s every child’s dream to have her
own pony, but Collier McLeod, a ﬁrst-
year member of the Washington and Lee
University riding team, has been living
that dream for 13 years.

“I always knew that I wanted to ride,
but my parents said I had to wait until ﬁrst
grade,” said McLeod, who began compet-
ing in second grade and got her own horse
in ﬁfth grade.

McLeod became a regular on the riding
circuit, practicing everyday for competi-
tions that took place anywhere from her
home state of Georgia to Canada. In 2008,
McLeod was named junior Amateur of the
Year among Canadian and American rid-
ers for best overall performance, earning
scholarship money among other prizes.
With so much practice time and so much
success, McLeod was familiar, with her
own horses. But at W&L, the riders don’t
get to keep the same horse all the time.

“I’1l ride a certain horse at practice
one day, but everyone takes turns, so it’s
weeks before I actually ride that horse
again,” explained McLeod. ‘

McLeod said she found the concept of
team horses challenging, but fun. And it’s

something she’ll have to get used to as a
rider at W&L as regional competitions op- '
erate under this system as well. The uni-
versity responsible for hosting a tourna-
ment must provide horses for every rider.’
Visiting teams don’t have to cart large
horse trailers across the country, but the
visitors are put in the challenging position
of depending on horses they have never
even seen before,

“Competitors draw a horse, get on, and
then walk around a brief circle before be-
ing judged,” McLeod said. “It’s deﬁnitely
different, and was slightly overwhelming
at ﬁrst because lots of us have never rid-
den in competitions like that before.”

The NCAA realizes the challenge of
unfamiliar horses and competitors are
judged solely on their personal perfor-
mance and not on their ability to connect
with the particular horse they are riding.

“The NCAA judges how correctly the
rider performs, which includes everything
from presentation to the course itself,”
McLeod said.

Despite the challenges of adjusting to
collegiate riding, McLeod is putting her
full effort into the W&L riding team.

‘‘I wasn’t looking for a college speciﬁ-
cally for the riding program, but it was in-
ﬂuential in my decision,” McLeod said.

At the Hollins Invitational on Oct. 18,
McLeod earned sixth place in Interme-
diate Equitation on the Flat, a category
speciﬁc to the NCAA. The Generals tied
for sixth place overall out of 10 compet-
ing schools and were led by six ﬁnishes in
the top three. Sophomore Tamara Morse
claimed third place in the Open Equitation
Over Fences and tied for third place W&L
senior captain Emily Coyle in the Open
Equitation on the Flat.

First-year Molly Rountree took third
place in the Intermediate Equitation Over
Fences and sophomore Catherine Skitsko
took third in the Novice Equitation Over
Fences. First-year Kerriann Laubach
rounded out the top ﬁnishers for the Gen-
erals, taking third place in the Beginner
Walk-Trot-Canter.

The riding team will next head to the I
Bridgewater Invitational on Saturday, Oc-
tober 31.
