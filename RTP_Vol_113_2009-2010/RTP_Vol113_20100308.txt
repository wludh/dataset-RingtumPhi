Alumni help
1n Ha1t1
Two ’97 graduates set up

camp and treat patients

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

When a devastating earthquake struck Haiti last
January, Dr. Sacha Montas and Dr. Anthony “Mazz”
Mazzarelli, both of the Washington and Lee class of
1997, knew immediately that they had to go help.
And they did.

Montas and Mazzarelli set up a “de facto refugee
camp” in Jimani, Dominican Republic, adjacent to
the Haitian border, just six days after the 7.0 earth-
quake struck Port-au-Prince. As one of the ﬁrst in-
ternational medical teams to arrive, they were im-
mediately faced with 30 to 50 new patients per day,
most of them severely injured.

Many of the patients had been tumed away from
overcrowded hospitals in Port-au-Prince and sur-
rounding areas. They came however they could, in
trucks or helicopters, to be treated at J imani Public
Hospital by the W&L alums and their team.

Mazzarelli, the medical director of the emergency
medical unit at Cooper Hospital in New Jersey and
the coordinator of the mission, said he was “amazed
by the strength and resiliency of the Haitian people,
even in the face of painful procedures and stories of
suffering and loss.”

Most of the patients had been dealing with their
injuries for days before receiving treatment, and the
shortage of medical supplies made the doctors’ jobs
even more difficult.

Montas said he regularly faced the dilemma of
realizing: “I have this many bandages or I have this
much medication. Can I give it right now to this pa-
tient, or do I have to save it for a patient that needs
it more?”

The team of doctors was able to bring some orga-
nization to the chaos by creating separate areas for
triage, wound care, surgery, medical and post-surgi-
cal care and intensive care.

In a PBS Newshour cover of the mission, Mon-
tas stressed the need for preventing infection and the
danger of operation, since a large number of patients
were amputees.

Montas, who grew up in New York, has Haitian
parents and spent many summers in Haiti with his
aunt and uncle. He can speak Creole, the language
spoken by 80 percent of Haitians.

“I get smiles when they hear someone who can
talk to them,” Montas said in his blog through the
University of Michigan, where he is a fourth-year
resident. He was one of few doctors who could
translate for the hundreds of patients the doctors had
to treat every day.

Montas not only treated his patients’ physical
wounds, but could also listen to their emotional pain
and hopes and fears for the future. So when about
40 patients, many post-operative, were transferred to
Fond Parisien, Haiti, Montas followed them to make
sure the new facilities could care for their complex
needs.

The rehabilitation center in Fond Parisien, which
was run by leaders from the Harvard Humanitarian
Initiative, proved to be a peaceful and organized set-
ting for the recovering patients and the team was
able to continue caring for many of their patients
from the Jimani Hospital.

Mazzarelli and Montas worked together for 12
days treating earthquake victims, but their friend-
ship goes all the way back to their time at W&L.
They were both biology majors, and they worked on
the Inter-Fratemity Council together, holding the top
two positions their senior year.

Most importantly, they both took a bioethics
seminar their senior year that exposed them to the
ﬁeld of health policy.

Their post-graduate honors include law degrees
from the University of Pennsylvania for Mazzarelli
and the University ofMichigan for Montas, and bio-
ethics degrees for both of them at UPenn.

Philadelphia Magazine has also named Mazza-
relli as part of “Next Generation of Great Doctors.”

The tragedy in Haiti has helped keep their jour-
ney from W&L undergrads to accomplished profes-
sionals in perspective.

“We feel thankﬁil for the opportunity to be re-
minded why we entered the field of healthcare,” said
Mazzarelli of his team’s work.

Montas described the nearly two weeks he spent
in Haiti as “the most pure form of taking care of
people I’ve ever experienced.”

Cracking
down on

drugs

 

Lesser-known SJC drug policy could convict students even if they aren ’t using drugs

By Kelsy Mccraw
STAFF WRITER

The Student Judicial Council

- has heard more than 30 drug-related

cases this year, but not all of these
involved drug possession. An over-
sight by the council has left students
responsible for a drug policy that
most didn’t know about.

Students not participating in ille-
gal drugs, even completely sober stu-
dents, have been convicted in cases
involving illegal substances simply
because they were in the same room
as other students who were using
these substances.

Over the past year, the SJC be-
gan holding students accountable for
being in an enclosed room with full
knowledge of illegal activity, such
as drug use, going on in the room.
The law students on the SIC Lise the
legal term “constructive possession”
to help explain the policy in convic-
tions.

However, neither the term not
the policy appears in any student lit-
erature. In an email, Crighton Allen,

chairman ofthe SJC, acknowledged
the problem.

“Due to an oversight in the Stu-
dent Handbook, this policy has not
been clearly laid out to students,” he
said.

Allen assured that the handbook
would be corrected next year.

Nevertheless, the SJC has consis-
tently used this policy all year. And
most students have had no idea that
they had done anything wrong before
their hearings.

The policy upholds the Universi-
ty’s “Zero Tolerance” for illegal sub-
stances. Thus the administration‘s
“crackdown" on drugs goes farther
than users and dealers.

Brandon Dotson. associate dean
of students, said that actively and
passively condoning students in-
volved with illegal drugs perpetuates
these activities. If illegal activities
become the norm in our community,
Robert E. Lee’s standard of gentle-
nian—like behavior is compromised.

According to Allen, this school
year has brought a trend of tolerance
tovvard drug use.

“This year, the SIC has seen an
unprecedented caseload in cases in-
volving illegal drugs,” he said.

Allen could not specify how many
cases ofconstructive possession have
been brought before the SJC. But he
said the SJC has heard 61 total cases
this year, which is 20 more than last
year, and more than half of these 6l
cases were drug-related.

But what should students do if
they find themselves in a compro-
mising situation‘?

Both Dotson and Allen said that
the policy does not require students
to report any illegal activity they
know about. Instead, students should
simply remove themselves from any
situation involving illegal activities,
or they should make their stance
against the behavior apparent.

However, students should not
worry about illegal activities in a

house or at a party. The policy only
applies to a closed room.

The policy calls on students to
quit condoning illegal activities.
While the law would only require
that a person not partake in the ille-
gal activity, this policy asks students
to hold a higher standard of self-gov-
ernance. '

Also, it is important to note that
the SJC and the deans differentiate
between constructive possession and
actual possession. Allen said that the
SJC differentiates the two in terms
of sanctions given to convicted stu-
dents. Similarly, Dotson said that
the difference could be seen on a
student’s behavioral record.

ESOL spends week teaching

Students travel to the Dominican Republic over break and teach at elementary schools

By Lizz Dye
smrr WRITER

English for Speakers of Other
Languages took 17 students for a
one-week experience in the Domini-
can Republic this year. About half
of the students on the trip were se-

niors, all were at least bilingual and
ﬁve were native Spanish speakers.
The three faculty members who ac-
companied them were Ellen Mayock,
professor of Romance languages and
ESOL advisor, Jeff Barnett, Head of
Latin American and Caribbean stud--
ies, as well as Jan Hathorn, W&L
athletic director.

The trip leaders were Natalie

Bunnell, Cailin Slattery and Kelsey
Wright. Mayock said that they “did a
spectacularjob organizing this year’s
trip.” The l7 students taught English
classes at the local elementary school,

(Escuela La Playa, taught intercultur-
al communications to the San Diego
Padres‘ recruits at the complex there,
and worked in a program called “Es-
pacios Para Crecer.”

“Espacios Para Crecer” is a pro-
gram designed for one-on-one read-
ing and homework help for students
during the time they are not in regular
school. Four volunteers also got to

make the trip with the Padres recruits
from Najayo to Santo Domingo to
discuss the recruits’ transition to life
in the U.S.

Mayock said that “ESOL’s over-
arching theme—both here in Rock-
bridge County and in the Dominican
Republic—continues to be literacy
for children and adults. To that end,
student volunteers did a big book
drive to collect Spanish, English and
bilingual books here in Lexington to
bring to the Najayo community. We
are hoping to build an actual library
there in 20ll and to continue with
semi-annual book drive efforts.”

In preparation for the trip, student
volunteers also did fundraising work

here through the Dominican Night at
Sweet Treats Bakery, a pizza night
and T-shirt sales.

In addition, sophomore Chris
Waslmock will be spending spring
term in Najayo as an intern to Pa-
dres employee Veronica Nogueira.
ESOL’s hope for Washnock is to ad-
vance the planning for a library dur-
ing his time there. The organization
hopes to make the Dominican Re-
public internship a regular feature of
the ESOL program, perhaps in con-
junction with Latin American and
Caribbean Studies.

Hillel sends volunteers to Uru

Group puts in time working with children in disadvantaged communities in Montevideo, Uruguay 0

By Kirsten Kyne
snxrr WRITER

Sun, sand and service. For 14
Washington and Lee students,
Washington Break was spent in
Montevideo, Uruguay, surround-
ed by warm weather, beacheand
people in need of their help.
These students spent their break
at a Uruguayan Hillel House
with people their age, working
with children in a shantytown.

“We helped distribute the
food, clean up their daytime nurs-
ery, and play games with them,

and proliferated conversation
about bettering their futures,”
said sophomore Lev Raslin. “We
also visited an abused wives and
children center which we helped
repair and play with the kids.”
Playing with the children was
the best part ofthe trip for many
of the students because they were
able to better their days, even if
it was for just a week. “We were
able to cross the language barri-
ers with them and spend hours
upon hours with them,” said
freshman Ali Greenberg. “It was

good to see the kids able to just
be kids.”

“I actually surprised myself.
I thought I was going to like
the beach and nightlife the best.
The Boys and Girls Club was
the best,” said freshman Melissa
Horadam. “We spent the day at
Punta Del Este [a famous South
American Beach] but, frankly,
I would have gone back to the
Boys and Girls Club. The kids
were really happy to have posi-
tive interaction.”

Raslin and the others were

able to meet and get to know
some of the local people their
age. “There is a strong Jewish
population in Uruguay,” he said.
“We are a minority so to see a
different culture that revolves
around the same roots was fasci-
nating and personally fulﬁlling.”

Aside from spending their
days helping local children and
women, the group was able to
learn more about Uruguayan cul-
ture. “We got to know the city
and shopping culture. Our days
were fully packed with service,

but it night we got to go out with
our peers,” said Greenberg.

“We went to a salsa club and
it was really, really fun to expe-
rience how people in Uruguay
go out,” said Horadam. “They
go out really late and come back
at like 6 in the morning. So I
danced all night to salsa music
with one of my friends from the
Hillel Uruguay.”

“We really bonded with each
other,” said freshman Nora Wal-
lenius.

The hardest part of the trip

was leaving the Boys and Girls
Club for the last time for many
students. “We were leaving...
and a little girl I had been play-
ing with refused to let me go,”
said Greenberg. “She kept saying
‘No, no, no.’”

Raslin said he would return
to Uruguay “in a heartbeat” if
he were given the opportunity
again. Most students agreed.
“If expense weren’t an issue, I
would deﬁnitely go back,” said
Horadam. “I’m never going to
forget this trip.”

Generals Christian Fellowship sends 14 students to volunteer at soup kitchens,

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

Fourteen members and two
leaders of the Generals Chris-
tian Fellowship (GCF) spent ﬁve
days of their Washington Break
working to help the homeless
and inner city families in Wash-
ington D.C.

The group helped D.C. locals
by working at a soup kitchen
called So Others Might Eat, or
SOME that provides breakfast
and lunch free to the public 365

days a year.

The group’s efforts also went
toward a geriatric day care,
Downtown Cluster, and helped
out with various after school
programs, such as Reaching Ob-
jectives through Joint Action or
ROJA and The Fishing School,
as well as DC Central Kitchen.

At The Fishing School, par-
ticipants helped third and fourth
graders with their homework.
According to junior Eric Ham-
scher, The Fishing School helped
disadvantaged youth in D.C.’s

inner-city schools. Hamscher
called the program, “really awe-
some.”

At Eden’s Center, an area in
D.C. known for its large Viet-
namese-American population,
GCF had the chance to experi-
ence a new culture and partici-
pate in a simulation dedicated to
homelessness.

During the simulation, trip
participants were divided into
groups of three, armed with two
dollars each, and told to ﬁnd a
homeless person throughout the

Trip to Texas

Volunteers work with low-income classrooms

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

A group of inspired female
students ﬂew to Houston, Texas.
for Washington Break to prepare
low-income Houstonians for
college and to reconnect with
W&L alumni.

On Sunday, Feb. 21 the 14
students ﬂew from Lynchburg,
Va. to Houston and were warmly
greeted by several W&L alumni.
Houston was chosen as the lo-
cation for the Nabors Service
League annual trip four years
ago because of its strong alumni
network.

Senior Samara Francisco, the
general chair of Nabors Service
League, says that a group contin-
ues to return to Houston because
the alumni are so enthusiastic
about hosting W&L students.

The young W&L women
began their eight to nine hour
workdays at YES Prep right
away, upon arrival. YES Prep is
a charter school that provides an
intensive college preparatory ed-
ucation for low-income students
in Houston. According to Na-

bors Service League Staff Ad-
visor, Melissa Caron ’09, YES
Prep has gotten 100 percent of
its economically disadvantaged
students to a university.

The W&L volunteers were
assigned to a variety of the seven
YES Prep campuses, throughout
Houston, where they assisted in
classroom work. While the vol-
unteers’ days lasted eight hours,
an average school day for YES
Prep students lasts nine.

This was the ﬁrst time that
Nabors had sponsored a trip con-
sisting solely of females. Caron
says however that the dynamic of
only women created an inspiring
atmosphere for the volunteers. It
was interesting for the volunteers
to hear from the female alumnae,
who hosted them.

For the six-day trip, the stu-
dents stayed among seven host
homes, six of whom were alum-
ni. The seventh host was an en-
thusiastic W&L parent. After the
eight-hour workday, the volun-
teers spent time at three alumni
dinners and events or enjoyed
dinner with their host family.

Francisco commented that

during the alumni dinners, dis-
cussions were often held with
nonproﬁt organizations and pub-
lic service ﬁgures throughout
Houston, particularly females.

“We met two women who
started their own nonproﬁts. One
was a language immersion pro-
gram to teach Spanish to kids,
and the other organization works
to improve the hydration of the
homeless population in Hous-
ton,” she said.

Throughout their six days in
Houston, the group of 14 female
students made signiﬁcant time
contributions to YES Prep, with
the hopes of sending more eco-
nomically unstable students to
college, and developed strong
relations with W&L Houston
alumni, while learning a lot
about their experiences.

“The alumni are so enthusias-
tic about W&L and love talking
with current students,” Francisco
said.

city to share dinner with.

Hamscher commented that
the exercise exposed the group
directly to homelessness in
Washington D.C.

“I enjoyed having dinner
with a homeless person because
it put me in a totally new and un-
expected situation from which I
was able to learn,” he said.

The 14 participants stayed at
the Headquarters of the group’s
host organization: the Center for
Student Missions.

Beyond their service to the

city, the group also spent a lot of
time thinking about God’s con-
cern for the poor and how their
lives could change to reflect his
concern. GCF Campus Staff
Member, Steve Tamayo said this
was his favorite part ofthe trip.

“I enjoyed the chance to make
deeper connections with the
folks on our team and to see God
expand their hearts for the poor,”
Tamayo said.

Nonetheless, Tamayo enjoyed
every aspect of the trip. When
asked what he enjoyed most

school programs and day care centers

about it, he responded, “It’s hard
to pick a “most.”

The group of 14 really bonded
together to make for a successful
trip. GCF leader, junior, Crystal
Spencer, commented that the
group really “meshed well.” A
strong close-knit group deﬁnitely
helped GCF complete its goal of
going as servants to a place they
would normally go as tourists.

Printer problems are becoming a major issue on campus

When the entire printer system crashes during midterms, Jarrett Brotzman needs a moment to vent

By Jarrett Brotzman
STAFF WRITER

The current state oftechnoIo-
gy at Washington and Lee is un-
acceptable. Computers that don‘t
work, printers that don’t print
and an email client that classi-
ﬁes Sakai email as junk are just
a few of the everyday problems
that accompany the otherwise
excellent student experience
here in Lexington.

Typically, I am not one to
publicly complain about these
issues. For the most part, stu-
dents here accept the poor state

 

of affairs as the unfortunate sta-
tus quo: an annoyance that one
learns to deal with. It is normal
for a C-School student to lose
work on Excel spreadsheets or
to expect a computer to take six
or seven minutes to boot up. This
is odd, as W&L makes claims of
at least adequately equipping
students.

As a student, I have dealt
with this over my past two and a
halfyears here. But the week be-
fore February Break, the system
completely broke down, and I
felt that I had to say something.

For many, myself included,

iiotheecilior

Men can make a di

the week before February Break
is midterm week. As part of my
midterm assignments, I had tests
and papers~and, like most stu-
dents, I need to print off papers
and study guides. However, on
this Thursday night, I found my-
self completely unable to use the
university printers.

Now this wasn’t just the case
with one printer in the Science
center. I found out, through the
process of attempting to use the
computers in most buildings on
the Hill, that the entire network
was down.

Perhaps I could understand if

°eI'ence

Men at Washington and Lee need to understand the
sexual assualt plight and be aware of the facts

Sexual assault is the Inost
serious problem facing Wash-
ington and Lee. W&L’s National
College Health Assessment sur-
vey in 2008 showed that female
students on this campus were
twice as likely as their national
peers to have experienced sexual
assault. This is totally unaccept-
able. Fortunately, there are steps
that male students can take to
end sexual assault at W&L.

For men, it all begins with
awareness. Too often I have en-
countered young men at W&L
who are skeptical about the sexu-
al assault statistics at this school.
Now it is true that college is a
place to question received wis-
dom. Socrates himself told his
students to question everything.

But those who question the
accuracy of the sexual assault
statistics have no evidence to
justify their skepticism.

I suspect that many of their
doubts arise from a desire to
sweep this inconvenient truth un-
der the rug. To confront a prob-
lem of such magnitude seems
potentially messy and certain to
upset the status quo.

A minority ofmen are respon-

sible for perpetrating sexual as-
sault at W&L. But a majority of
men bear the blame for failing to
take this problem seriously. Why
is this‘? As a man. it is not easy
to place yourself in the shoes of
a sexual assault victim. I think
back to Professor Bidlack’s
Soviet history course when he
spoke about the 1932-33 fam-
ine in the Ukraine that took the
lives of millions of people. Dur-
ing that lecture I raised my hand
and told him that, frankly. I was
having a hard time identifying
with the starvation victims. I’ve
never been hungry a day in my
life, so the idea of dying for lack
of food is completely foreign to
me. Similarly, I’ve never been
sexually assaulted, so the idea
of sexual assault is at best an
abstraction. But for millions of
women around the world, and
hundreds on this campus, sexual
assault is not a statistic or an ab-
straction. It is a grim reality.
Male students at W&L must
make an extra effort to under-
stand the gravity of the crisis.
The university could help by re-
quiring all ﬁrst-year students to
take a one-credit course cover-

ing health-related topics includ-
ing sexual assault. This idea has
been batted around for a while,
and I’m proud to say it seems to
be gaining traction now. While I
will applaud this step, should it
come, it is not enough in and of
itself. Sexual assault prevention
education needs to be a continu-
ous part of the college experi-
ence.

Sexual assault and rape are
serious violations of a person’s
civil rights. As civilized people
we cannot tolerate these viola-
tions, just as we do not tolerate
lynching or segregation. Men at
W&L must come to terms with
the problem and do their part
to end it. Do not sit on the side-
lines. Become part of the solu-
tion. This is real. END IT.

Even amid a signiﬁcant de-
cline in our endowment, I feel
as though maintenance of basic
student computing resources
should take some sort of prior-
ity in university expenditures. I
am not quite sure how much the
real cost of printing a page is,
but I suspect that the $.10 — $.25
charge per page is more than
enough to cover the maintenance
of our system.

I hope that this at least serves

to initiate some discussion in
the administration on the proper
course of action needed to rec-
tify this unacceptable condition.
We pride ourselves on being a

is too bad the priorities of the ad-

Reading fast for children’s books

5' First Book is annual Speed Read competition raises money for books for lykes and tots, Fancy Dress tickets for winner

By Melissa Powell
smrr WRITER

First Book is putting students’ reading abilities to the test. The third annual Speed Read competition is being held this
‘ week in Elrod Commons to ben-
eﬁt local elementary schools.

Continuing until next Mon-
day, students can donate money
in exchange for 15 seconds to
read out loud as fast as they can.
Those who read the most words
will win. Multiple winners are
chosen and can receive a vari-
ety of prizes from the Univer-
sity bookstore and local busi-
nesses like Lexington Coffee
Shop, Pumpkinseeds and Alvin
Dennis.

The top prize is Fancy Dress
tickets.

The Speed Read booth will
be set up each school day from
10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and represen-
tatives from each sorority will
time participants.

First Book is a nonproﬁt or-
ganization that works to give
underprivileged children their
first new books.

The money raised from the
event will go to local elemen-
tary schools with large low-in-
come populations. Community
Liaison Chair Co-chair, Kara
Karcher, a junior, said First
Book allows the elementary
students to choose new books to
receive. The organization plans
to hand-deliver the books and
will hopefully have a reading
day with the students, Karcher
said.

“Helping these children gain
access to books is important be-
cause it helps to ensure that the
learning that takes place in the
school environment can be en-
riched in their homes through
the books we provide,” Karcher
said. “Reading is such an impor-
tant part of childhood; not only
is it a fun activity, [but] it’s an
essential skill that they will use
throughout their lives.”

Senior Jessie Wang founded
First Book at Washington and
Lee in 2007. Speed Read has
been an annual event ever since
the organization’s founding.
Wang said First Book also tries to
hold fundraisers outside ofW&L
in the Lexington and Rockbridge
County area. For example, the
organization held a fundraiser
during a Virginia Military lnsti-
tute football game last semester.

“it helps to bridge the gap
between W&L and the town.”
Wang said. “It also strengthens
Panhellenic spirit on campus be-
cause it gives all six sororities an
opportunity to work together for
a common cause.”

First Book is a national orga-
nization with hundreds of local
advisory boards, like the one at
W&L. Nationally, First Book
was founded by Kyle Zimmer, a
corporate lawyer from Washing-
ton, D.C. who tutored children
at an inner-city soup kitchen at

night. Zimmer noticed that the
children she tutored had no books
to read, and 80 percent of low-in-
coine preschool and after-school
programs had no age-appropriate
books for children.

Zimmer and two friends
started First Book to provide the
resources these facilities needed
Now, almost 20 years later, First
Book has delivered more than 65
million books to educational pro-
grams for children in the United
States and Canada.

Nationally, First Book accepts
monetary donations and large-
scale donations of new books
directly from publishers. First
Book does not accept donations
of new or used books directly
from individuals; however, its
Web site does provide an option
for individuals to mail in used
books for reselling or recycling,
with a portion of the proceeds
beneﬁtting First Book.

Karcher encourages students
to get involved with Speed Read
Week since it’s something that
makes a difference for children
in the area.

“Speed Read is a fast and fun
way to give back to the commu-
nity in a big way,” Karcher said.
“Every child should be given the
opportunity to own and enjoy
their own books.”

Alpha Delta Pi members Chase Noyes and Julia Farnham
monitor last year’s the Speed Read table in the Commons. All
six sororities work to support First Book during this week.

Actors, dancers head to “Chicago”

Spring musical makes winter debut as W&L dancers, thespians and singers take the stage in this sexy crowd-pleaser

By Katie Boe
STAFF WRITER

The curtain goes up on the
Robert O. and Elizabeth M.
Bentley Musical, “Chicago,”
on Thursday. The cast and crew
have put months of design, pro-
duction and rehearsal into the
musical in the hopes of enter-
taining the Washington and Lee
campus. This year, the theater
department chose to move what
had been the spring musical to
the winter term.

“We didn’t think there was
enough time during the new,
shortened spring term to inte-
grate all the technical elements
that go into the show,” said Owen
Collins, associate professor of
theater. “Putting on a show takes

a lot of time and work, and we
were not sure ifwe would be able
to accomplish it in a month.”
“Chicago” is certainly a
crowd-pleaser, and its success
both in theater and ﬁlm made it
a desirable choice. The process
for choosing a musical is gener-
ally a collaboration between the
theater and music departments.
Each department makes a list
of potential shows and presents
it to the other department. The
departments together make the
ﬁnal decision together.
“‘Chicago’ was a fun choice
because it combines comedy, a
strong plot, interesting charac-
ters and great dance,” said Col-

lins. “With the increase in dance
interest on campus, we really
wanted to choose a show that
had some great dancing!”

The theater department also
likes to choose from a variety of
genres as to diversify what the
campus can see. Past shows have
included operettas, straight coin-
edy and more contemporary, pop
choices.

This year’s musical features
15 W&L students in the cast who
have dedicated time to the show
since the middle of fall term. Ini-
tial music and dance rehearsals
began in the middle of fall, and
the time requirement has only in-
creased since then.

Noel Price, a ﬁrst-year cast
member, has had rehearsal from
7 to 10 pm. nearly every day in
February and from 6:30 to 11
p.m. every day in March until the
show opens.

“I’ve really enjoyed getting to
meet new people in the cast who
otherwise I probably wouldn’t
know. I also love ‘Chicago.’ It’s
one of those shows that everyone
wants to do,” said Price.

“The cast of the show is so
multi-talented,” Collins said.
“Some of the leads aren’t even
theater majors. I think this re-
ally reflects W&L’s campus as
so many of the students are in-
volved and successful in many

New tunes for winter

WL UR radio station highlights this month is new music

ByWLUR Staff
STAFF WRITERS

Four new reviews from four
different reviewers on our staff.
Let these satisfy your new music
craving:

Shout Out Louds
Work (Merge)

In theory, it should be hard to
be passionate about Shout Out
Louds’ music. After all, there are
plenty of bands doing really ﬁne
indie pop these days, particular-
ly from the band’s homeland of
Sweden. However, there’s some-
thing to be said for mastery of
one’s craft, and these guys have
had it going since their stunning
2005 debut Howl Howl GaffGaff
Work is their second record for
Merge—following up on 2007’s
quite good Our Ill W1Tlls—and it’s
their best, most complete LP yet.

As is the case with any good
band, Shout Out Louds can ap-
peal to lovers of other acts—like
Jens Lekman, Camera Obscura,
Peter Bjorn & John, Ra Ra Riot
and New Order—without sound-
ing exactly like any of them.
Adam Olenius’s songwriting is
top of the line, and his emotive-
yet-not-emo vocals ebb and flow
through the album’s 10 tracks.
Like Lekman, Olenius has been
living in Melbourne, Australia
recently, and with the rest of the
band scattered around the globe,
Work was put together piece by
piece. But the band’s proﬁciency,
combined with Phil Ek’s produc-
tion, eliminates any trace of dis-
jointedness.

In short, this is one of 2010’s
best pop records. Start with
“Walls,” “I999,” “Fall Hard” and

“Show Me Something New.”
Shearwater

Golden Archipelago
(Matador)

Can I tell you a secret? I didn’t
really like Shearwater’s previous
record Rook all that much as an
album, but pretended that I did
for a while because I really love
Okkervil River and, thus, really
love Shearwater by association
(not to mention their older stuff is
solid). So, when I listened to The
Golden Archipelago, I was pre-
pared to write a positive review,
even if it was just as personally
unsatisfying as Rook. Fortunate-
ly, the album is actually totally
amazing and I fell for it within
minutes.

Here’s a nice, appropriately
dramatic blurb from the band's
label, Matador:

“Shearwater continue to ex-
plore the beauty, menace, and fra-
gility of the natural world—and
that increasingly rare species, the
indivisible a1bum—on The Gold-
en Archipelago, the band’s most
absorbing and accomplished
work to date. The new record is
the third panel of a triptych that
includes 2006’s enigmatic Palo
Santa and 2008’s acclaimed
Rook, albums linked by themes
of environmental and personal
decay and humans’ impact on
nature. In The Golden Archipel-
ago, Shearwater turn to a portrait
of life on islandswa world of
alternating lushness and auster-
ity, numinous silences and sud-
den cataclysms, and the strange
flowerings of plant, animal and

The

human life that only arise in iso-
lation... The results are singular,
revelatory, and demand to be ap-
preciated as a whole. Islands un-
der siege, islands ofimpenetrable
solitude, islands of the world
and islands of the mind—all are
here in The Golden Archipelago,
whose shores and reefs ﬂicker
and beckon, even as they crum-
ble under rising seas.”
FOX Japan
Reenactment (Small War)

Having adored FOX Japan’s
music from the early days (hey,
being a friend of the bassist,
Washington and Lee’s own Sam
Wilmoth ’08, certainly has its
perks), I’m not surprised at what I
hear on Reenactment, the group’s
latest record. FOX Japan blends
sharp and intricate guitars with
sharp andjabbing lyrics, a strong
marriage of forms that makes
every listen a joy. Based out of
Morgantown, W. Va., brothers
Sam, Charlie and Pete Wilmoth
form the core of the band, with
Andrew Slater providing ﬁne
work on the six-string.

Fans of Talking Heads, Ok-
kervil River and the Pixies will
dig the songs on this one, particu-
larly “Hate Hate Them” and “The
Pedant.” Political songs tend
to make me a little uneasy, but
the Brothers Wilmoth are smart
about them (and watch out: one
of the most overtly rabble-rous-
ing, “Glenn Beck,” one of my
favorites on here, is riddled with
profanity). Catchy, off-kilter, and
cynical as hell, FOX Japan deliv-
ers on its promise of producing

Announcement ofa Fellowship for Members of the Rising Senior and Junior Classes

“catchy, word-drunk indie rock.”
Joe Pug
Messenger (Lightning Rod)

Paste Magazine tells it like it
is: “Pug’s scorching poetry and
soulful, ‘every phrase could be
my last’ voice will stop you cold.
If you want to read the actual
endorsement, touch the Braille
stretching up my arms.”

Joe Pug’s Messenger is a re-
freshingly unique album in an
oversaturated indie-folk world.

Last year, Pug’s EP Nation of

Heat graced WLUR’s playi-
ist. This full-length album will
surely make fans of that release
delighted, satisﬁed and excited
that Pug has once again deliv-
ered. Comparisons with Bob
Dylan’s poetically-rhythmic lyric
delivery are hard to avoid. Add-
ing to the Dylan parallels is Pug’s
scratchy folk voice that Paste so
eloquently endorses.

If you’re approaching this al-
bum with Nation ofHeat in mind,
you’ll notice more dynamics:
pedal steel, rhythm sections and
harmonies. If you’re new to Pug,
then you’ll be swept away by his
meticulous attention to his songs.
And the album’s production puts
you in the room with the music.
Out of the recent slew of folk re-
cords we’ve received at WLUR,
Messenger is certainly at the top
of my list. Start with “The First

»Time I Saw You,” “Disguised as
Someone Else” and “Messen-

as

ger.

different areas.”

The audition process for the
musical was competitive. Jeni
Pritchett, a sophomore and the
stage manager for the show, said
singing and a monologue pre-
sentation were required for the
audition.

“This year, we had to cut a lot
of really talented people simply
because there is a speciﬁc vi-
sion for a show of this caliber,”
Pritchett said.

There was also a dance portion
to the audition where auditioners
were taught a dance phrase and
then asked to perform it.

“The dance audition re-
ally shows your ability to learn

quickly and accurately [as well
as] your coordination and dance
skills,” Collins said.

The overall favorite number
in the show is the “Cellblock
Tango” which features six wom-
en in prison for killing their hus-
bands. “It’s so much fun and so
catchy,” Pritchett said.

“Chicago” will run from
March 11 to 14 at 7:30 p.m. in
the Keller Theater and is destined
to be a crowd-pleaser, Tickets are
available at the Box Office or at
lenfest.wlu.edu. Tickets are $5
for students and $8 for faculty
and staff.

CAN “MAKE A DIFFERENCE”?

Members of the Classes of 201 1 and 2012 are invited to apply for the S. Cullum Owings, Jr.
Fellowship for the Academic Year 2010-11. The holder of this fellowship will receive a credit of
$1250 toward each term’s tuition and will be expected to make several visits to secondary schools
around the country throughout the academic year to promote the Initiative for Academic Integrity
under the guidance ofthe Washington and Lee Institute for Honor. Together with some of the visits,
the Owings Fellow will also visit the local chapter ofthe Washington and Lee Alumni Association to
discuss the state of the University from a student’s point of view, with particular regard to the Honor
System.

Cullum Owings was a member of the Class of2003, an exceptional individual from Atlanta,
Georgia, who died tragically in an automobile accident during his senior year.

The Fellowship is administered by the Campus Committee of the Washington and Lee
Institute for Honor. Criteria for selection of Owings Fellows are, first of all, that the applicants should
possess outstanding personal integrity. They should be good scholars, but the Fellowship is not
limited to students with exceptional grade-point averages. They should be articulate, with some grace
and poise in demeanor, while at the same time being sensitive to the values and opinions of others.
They should be students who show promise of developing into community leaders ofhigh standards.

Applicants are asked to submit their applications to Professor Emeritus Lewis G. John,
Department of Politics, who serves as Secretary of the Campus Committee. There is no application
form, but the application should include:

(1) A copy of the student’s transcript

(2) A resume of activities and special talents

(3) An essay of approximately 250 words with the heading, “How my personal values and
experience qualify me to represent Washington and Lee as a Cullum Owings ’03 Fellow”

(4) A statement of willingness to make the off-campus visits as described above

(5) Names of two or more members of the faculty from whom the selection committee may
seek recommendations

Applications are due by Monday, March 15, 2010, and should be submitted by campus mail
(Professor Lewis John, c/o Department of Politics) or via e-mail ('Lo,l1n_], lit) The selection
process will include personal interviews with the selection committee on M for those finalists
judged most worthy on the basis of their written applications. Questions may be addressed to
Professor John or to Maggie Fiskow, the 2009-10 Owings Fellow.

Slim pickings in NFL free agency

New limits will cripple this year is free agency period creating a hodgepodge of players in the free agent pool

By Adam Cancryn
STAFF COLUMNIST

Add some garden gnomes and used
furniture, and the 2010 NFL free agent
pool might be mistaken for a yard sale.

In one comer is running back La-
Dainian Tomlinson. A former all-pro
and 2006 MVP, the San Diego Chargers
unceremoniously cut him following two
injury-plagued years.

Sitting with the toddler toys is wide-
out Terrell Owens. He made ﬁve con-
secutive Pro Bowls at one point and was
considered a near-lock Hall of Famer.
But a decline in productivity and an in-
crease in ego have left Owens without a
team for the second time in two years.

Right behind him, mixed in with the
old clothes, is 34-year-old Chad Pen-
nington. The noodle-armed quarterback
is on the move again after losing his
starting job in Miami. He has yet to start
back-to-back full seasons over his 10-
year career.

It wasn’t supposed to be this way.
Thanks to an expiring labor contract,
the 2010 season is uncapped, meaning
that there is no limit on how much teams

can spend on players. On the surface,
this sounded like a great opportunity.
Freed from the ﬁnancial conﬁnes of the
salary cap, teams could overhaul their
rosters by simply throwing money at the
top free agents. The NFL’s competitive
landscape would shift radically as teams
made improvements that, normally,
would take years to complete.

The players were ecstatic too. At no
other point would competition for their
services be this high. Free agents would
get to pick from numerous bidders, who
would drive prices to an all—time high in
their desire to get the most out of this
rare opportunity. Everyone would get
rich.

But when free agency ﬁnally did be-
gin at midnight on March 5, there was
no stampede of owners dragging bags
of money. In fact, because of ﬁne print
clauses and unconventional regulations,
this uncapped year might amount to a
whole lot of nothing.

The NFL and the Players Association
are entering the last year oftheir collec-

tive bargaining agreement. The CBA is
a union contract negotiated between the
players and the league that sets rules sur-
rounding treatment of the athletes, from
practice schedules to retirement beneﬁts
to contract negotiations. And while the
CBA calls for an uncapped ﬁnal year,
it also sets limits that will cripple this
year’s free agency period.

In the past, players could ﬁle for un-
restricted free agency after their four-
year contract had expired. But in 2010,
players are not unrestricted until after
six seasons. So anyone whose four-year
contract has ended instead becomes a
restricted free agent. Teams can make
offers to a restricted player, but if they
choose to sign him, they must surren-
der high draft picks to the original team
as compensation. Unrestricted players
come with no such requirements.

For teams that ﬁnished in the top
eight in the league last year, it is even
tougher to successfully court a free
agent. As a measure added to prevent
the best teams from getting exponential-

ly better, the top eight must lose a play-
er to free agency before they can sign
one. Furthermore, the salary they offer
a free agent cannot be any larger than
that of the player they lost. This means
that teams like the Saints, Colts, Jets and
Vikings are automatically out of the run-
ning for top players like Julius Peppers,
who will likely command a salary well
into eight ﬁgures.

The rules might be complex, but the
takeaway is this: few young stars will
test the market, leaving teams to sift
through a smaller pile of aging, high-
risk players.

Of the unsigned top 100 free agents
according to Yahoo! Sports, 63 are re-
stricted, while just 30 are unrestricted.
Additionally, restricted free agents are
signiﬁcantly younger, and therefore
more valuable, than unrestricted free
agents.

The restricted class, boasting rising
stars like Texans LB Demeco Ryans
and Dallas WR Miles Austin, is an aver-
age of 27.6 years old. The average age

of unrestricted free agents is 31.5. That
gap makes a huge difference in a league
where the average career length is just
three and a half years.

Even more unfortunate for teams
looking to improve is that, after Peppers
and linebacker Karlos Dansby, there are
few attractive options on the unrestricted
market. Pennington, the best available
QB, hasn’t proven he can stay healthy
for any length of time. Tomlinson, Brian
Westbrook and Larry Johnson were a
top trio a few years ago, but they have
all begun the rapid descent that hampers
running backs over 30.

What will likely come out of this
disappointing free agent class is an in-
crease in off-season trades. Unwilling to
lose draft picks or gamble on an aging
player, most teams will bypass the CBA
restrictions and deal directly with other
franchises. ,

As for the players, they will continue
to sit amongst the old books and dusty
lamps, trying to distinguish themselves
as a gem in a yard full of clutter.

Generals win ODACs, but fall in NCAAs

The Washington and Lee women 3 basketball team won its ﬁrst ever ODAC championship and set a new program record with 18 wins

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s
basketball team’s Cinderella story was
cut short this weekend when the 2010
ODAC champions (18-10) fell to unde-
feated Christopher Newport, 68-51.

The Generals just couldn’t keep up
with the Captains’ fast-paced offense.
An early six-point lead was all CNU
needed to secure the victory. CNU led
by 40-24 at halftime and its lead would
never waiver.

The Generals couldn’t get the ball in
the basket—shooting only 37.5 percent
for the game—or grab the ball off the
backboard, falling behind 21-34 on re-
bounds.

“We went in thinking we had a good
chance to win, so it deﬁnitely was dis-
appointing,” said sophomore forward
Becca Bolton.

But the bittersweet ending marks the
close of a record-setting season and a
breadth of accomplishments. W&L ﬁn-
ished the season with 18 wins, the most
in program history, and the team’s ﬁrst-
ever ODAC championship.

Head Coach Mandy King “has been
talking since the beginning about cut-
ting down nets and I’m not sure if any of
us realized we could do that,” said ﬁrst-
year Katy Wilson. “We had good run at

the end... We played good team ball.”

The Generals ﬁnished the regular
season by setting a program record for
conference victories at 14. They defeat-
ed Bridgewater 67-53 at home in their
ﬁnal regular season game. The win was
enough to give W&L a No. 3 seed in the
ODAC Tournament over Washington
Break.

But No. 3 on the books ﬁnished No.
1 on the podium. The Generals found
their stride at the Salem Civic Center,
and their play was nothing short of
magical. Boosted by double-doubles
from both Bolton and junior center Fe-
lice Herman, the Generals took down
Guilford, 72-66, in the ﬁrst round of the
tournament. Bolton’s 17 points and 14
rebounds gave the sophomore her 14th
double-double of the season. Herman’s
13 points and 10 rebounds marked her
fourth double-double of the season.

The win marked just the third time
in W&L women’s basketball team his-
tory that the team has advanced past the
ﬁrst round of the ODAC tournament.
The last team to make it this far was the
2006-2007 team.

W&L’s shooting hot streak cooled
off against Eastem Mennonite in the
next round. The Generals shot only 37.5

percent from the ﬁeld, but grit and en-
durance helped keep their tournament

helps when you have people like Becca
[Bolton] who can get points and assists.

Head coach Mandy King “has been talking since the

beginning about cutting down nets and I ’m not sure if

any of us realized we could do that. ”

Katy Wilson, forward

run alive. W&L rebounded from its slow
ﬁrst-halfperformance with a 12-0 run to
tie the game with just under 10 minutes
remaining. The Generals put turnovers
and sloppy play behind them and domi-
nated the scoreboard throughout the rest
of the game.

Sophomore guard Meg Ingram put
up 16 points for the Generals while ju-
nior guard Allie Long added 12 points.
Wilson had nine points and 10 boards,
making her mark on the tournament
run. ’

“If something’s not going my way,
I try to do stuff 1 can control, like get-
ting rebounds,” Wilson said. “Plus it

The scoring is really equal. It’s easy to
perfonn well with a team like that.”

Facing their ﬁrst ODAC champi-
onship contest ever, game-time jitters
weighed heavily on the Generals when
they took on Virginia Wesleyan Univer-
sity. But no Cinderella story is complete
without the glass slipper, and W&L de-
feated VWU 64-56 to claim its ﬁrst-ever
ODAC Championship title and an auto-
matic bid to the NCAA tournament.

W&L led early on in the game, but
shooting woes kept the team scoreless
for a good part of the ﬁrst half and the
Generals were down 32-23 heading into
halftime.

With the nerves out of their system,
the Generals came out of the locker
room ready to play. W&L used a 9-0 run
to tie the game at 32-32 with 15:21 to
play. W&L and VWU traded baskets,
but it was the Generals who ultimately
pulled away. Fittingly, it was Bolton
who gave the Generals the ultimate
lead. The guard hit a lay-up that surged
the Generals ahead 50-49. They never
looked back.

Bolton put up her 15th double-dou-
ble for the season with 14 points, 10
rebounds, ﬁve assists and four steals.
Wilson had another stellar rookie perfor-
mance for the Generals with a double-
double of her own with 13 points and 10
rebounds. Both Bolton and Wilson were
named to the all-toumament team.

“I think we’ve ﬁnally gotten more
respect,” Wilson said. “People didn’t re-
ally know who we were... We have to
keep it up at a high level. We’re retum-
in g all ﬁve starters, so people are expect-
ing a lot from us next season.”

Men’s basketball drops to VWC in ODACS

W&L defeated Emory and Henry 92-60 in the first round but dropped a tough 85-80 loss to lﬁrginia Wesleyan

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDIOTR

The Washington and Lee men’s bas-
ketball team may have missed out on the
ODAC Championships, but the 2009-
2010 was not without its glory. The
Generals ﬁnished the season at 17-10,
the most single-season wins earned by a
W&L team since the 1988-1989 season.

“l7 wins with such a young team is
a huge success,” said junior guard Jason
Cimino. “Also, 1 think it’s a good mea-
suring stick that we played our best bas-
ketball at the end of the year.”

The No. 6-seeded Generals swatted
the Emory and Henry College Wasps,
92-60, in the ﬁrst round of the ODAC
tournament. The winning 92-point total
was the highest scoring game for the
Generals this season. The Generals came
out ﬁring and a 45.7 shooting percentage
in the ﬁrst half helped give them a 33-7
run to close out the half. The Generals
went into the locker room up 43-23.

And the shots just kept falling in the
second half. The Generals kept up their
accuracy, drilling 44.4 percent from be-

hind the three-point line. The No. 11-
seeded Wasps committed 17 turnovers
with only nine assists, compared to
W&L’s 11 turnovers and 15 assists.

The Generals also towered over the
Wasps on the boards, outrebounding
them 46-25.

Senior forward Andrew Payne, in his
last game in the Warner Center, contrib-
uted 21 points for a career high. Fellow
senior forward Ben Goetsch added 11
points. Sophomore guard Jon Guest put
up 12 points and Cimino added 10.

“Personally, I thought I played well,”
Cimino said. “When you get into games
like those, when it’s win or go home, it’s
a matter of not wanting to lose.”

The Generals next hit the road for
the ODAC quarterﬁnals and a match-up
against’ No. 3 seed Virginia Wesleyan
College. W&L led for the majority of
the game, but the Generals couldn’t hold
on for the win and they dropped out of
championship contention with an 85-80
loss.

“The Virginia Wesleyan game was
tough,” Cimino said. “I thought we had
a great chance to win; we just didn’t
come up with the big play.”

The two teams traded baskets in the
ﬁrst half with neither team leading by
more than six. W&L shot 47.2 percent
for the half versus the Marlins’ 43.8 per-
cent.

The edge allowed the Generals to
pull away toward the end of the half and
they came into the second with a 42-37
lead.

The Generals kept their lead alive
well into the second half. Virginia Wes-
leyan pulled ahead only once, with a 43-
42 lead ﬁve minutes into the half.

That lead didn’t even last a full 30
seconds before Payne dished out a layup
to move the Generals back up.

But the Marlins weren’t done ﬁght-
ing. They pulled ahead again, 56-54 with
9:08 left in the half, and the Generals
just couldn’t regain their momentum.

Goetsch closed out his W&L ca-

reer with a double-double. He put up
19 points and 11 rebounds to lead the
Generals. Payne added 11 points, six
rebounds and three assists in his ﬁnal

teammate I’ve ever had. They are win-
ners, and that’s the highest compliment I
can give them.”

Cimino complemented the seniors

“I 7 wins with such a young team is a huge success.

Also, I think its a good measuring stick that we played
our best basketball at the end of the year ”

Jason Cimino, guard

showing.

“The three seniors [Goetsch, Payne,
and forward Zac White] are unbeliev-
able,” Cimino said. “They’ve done so
much for this program, it’s wild. Ben
[Goetsch] is the hardest-working team-
mate I’ve ever had. Zac is the best player
I’ve ever played with. Payne is the best

with a career-high 18 points, three as-
sists and three steals, showing that he’s
more than ready to ﬁll the senior leader-
ship position next year.

Back-to-back wins

Men is lax defeated Greensboro College 9-4 and Washington College 9-5

By Henri Hammond-Paul
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee Generals
Men’s Lacrosse team improved to 5-0
with back-to-back wins over Greensboro
College and Washington College.

On a cold and cloudy Wednesday, the
Generals came out to play against Greens-
boro and posted a 9-4 victory.

Facing off against Greensboro, ﬁrst-
year attack Mac Means started the scor-
ing at 8:42 in the ﬁrst quarter off an assist
from senior midﬁelder Max Mancuso.

Means led the team with three goals
and one assist, showing great promise for
his rookie season. Senior Kevin Feeney
and sophomore Rob Look, the General’s
faceoff specialists, controlled this game,
winning 10 out of 16 between the two of
them. .

But the big story of the game was the
Generals’ defense. Senior goalkeeper Matt
Mason played for 56:54 minutes, leaving
only for a brief injury. Mason posted nine
saves and let in only four goals. The Gen-
erals’ defense kept Greensboro’s offense
away from the ball and only allowed them
25 shots.

The Generals outshot Greensboro by
15 with a total of 40 shots on goal. Senior
Captain and attack Will Keigler chipped in
two goals and one assist and sophomore
attack Scott Meehan tallied one goal and
two assists.

The following Saturday the No. 10-
ranked Generals came out to a full crowd
and warm weather to face mid-Atlantic
powerhouse Washington College. The
Generals were up to the challenge and
they outscored WAC 9-5. The Gener-
als’ defense may have been dominant on
Wednesday, but team chemistry was the
key to getting thejob done against WAC.

“All year we had been led by our de-
fense and goaltending, which have the
ability to keep us in any game even if our
offense is struggling,” said sophomore

Washington College player tries to chase him down.

Sam Mott. “Against WAC, we showed
signs with some of the best offense we
had had all year, especially in the 2nd
quarter.”

Junior midﬁelder Drew Koeneman
led the team with two goals and one as-
sist, while Keigler and Means paced the
offense with two points each. With this
game now in his pocket, Keigler is only 24
points away from being the all time lead-
ing point-getter at W&L. He presently has
168 total points and is sixth on the list of
overall points in W&L lacrosse history.

Mason posted eight saves and only
allowed ﬁve goals off of WAC’s total 29

shots in the game. While the game statis-
tics were pretty even between the teams-
each team had 29 shots on goal, 8 saves,
and 30 tumovers—W&L dominated the
pace and controlled the play for the major-
ity ofthe game.

W&L has some solid wins under its
belt, but the Generals will face a challeng-
ing lineup starting on March 9 when they
play Ohio Wesleyan at home at 7 p.m.
They will then travel to Franklin and Mar-
shall on Mar. 13.

Baseball improves to 2-5

W&L ran over Southern Virginia 12-3 and split games with Lynchburg

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee baseball team
started moving in the right direction this
past week with a l2-3 win over Southern
Virginia and split against Lynchburg, go-
ing 1-3 and 9-2 for the Generals. The team
suffered through a rough opening week in
Atlanta during Washington Break as they
dropped all four contests against Emory,
Piedmont, and two against Oglethorpe. The
team could have cited the abnormally cold
weather and copious amounts of snow that
hindered preseason practice as the reason
for the slow start, but made no such excus-
es. Instead, the defending ODAC champs
came home and immediately erased that
zero in the win column.

On Wednesday, SVU came to visit
Cap’n Dick Smith Field and W&L, to put
it simply, gave ’em the business. The Gen-
erals would eventually win by a score of
12-3, but victory did not look so certain
at ﬁrst. Sophomore pitcher Roger Strong
started the game for W&L and escaped the
ﬁrst inning with the bases loaded and no
runs scored. The team’s ace, senior pitcher
Chuck Davidson, took over in the third in-
ning and soon ran into some trouble. SVU
tagged him for three runs en route to jump-
ing out to a 3-1 lead. But that would be the
only offense for SVU the rest of the day.

On a chilly day, W&L’s bats came alive
as the top ﬁve hitters in the lineup went
a combined ll-l9 with 10 runs batted in.
Second baseman senior John Ditore lead

the way for the Generals with four hits and
four runs scored. Senior pitcher Nate Ad-
kins picked up the win for W&L. A visibly
frazzled Nick Denny took the loss both
literally and physically for SVU. (A large
contingent of Betas in the stands should be
given credit for knocking the lefty offhis
game with their verbal onslaughts).

Three days later the team boarded the
bus and traveled to rival Lynchburg for a
Saturday double—hcader. The story of the
ﬁrst game was Lynchburg’s starting pitch-
er Connor Thompson. Thompson hurled
seven innings for the Hornets, allowing
only one earned run and scattering a mere
ﬁve hits. Ditore continued his recent suc-
cess by singling and eventually scoring
in the ﬁrst inning on a sacriﬁce ﬂy off the
bat of senior ﬁrst baseman Hunter Seren-
betz. But that would be the last time W&L
would light up the run column in that con-
test, eventually losing by a score of 3-l.

Davidson battled Thompson throughout
his six strong innings of work for W&L,
but eventually took the hard luck loss. Di-
tore ﬁnished 3-5 andjunior outﬁelder An-
thony Cardona posted his second straight
2-4 day at the plate.

But the second game was a completely
different story. Strong went seven innings
for W&L, keeping Lynchburg at bay and
W&L in the game long enough for a sev-
enth inning rally. Down 2-1 in the seventh,
the Generals exploded for six runs en route

to a 9-2 win.

Freshman shortstop Jonathan Stutts
lifted the sacriﬁce fly that scored senior
C] Thompson and gave W&L the lead for
good in the middle of the seventh.

“It was good to come back and get a
win in the second game,” said Stutts of
the team’s effort. “It was nice to see the
team rebound like that. I would deﬁnitely
say we were happy splitting games with a
tough conference opponent.”

Senior third baseman Jim Plantholt
went 3-5 in the second game; sophomore
outﬁelder Mike Decembrino, Serenbetz,
and Ditore all added two base hits and two
RBl’s. Ditore has been making his pres-
ence felt the past three games with nine
hits in 15 at bats, good enough for a spar-
kling .600 batting average.

With an overall record of 2-5 and con-
ference record of 1-1, the Generals are
slowly climbing out of the early season
hole they dug for themselves. Defense is
what needs to be improved the most to get
back to .500, said Stutts.

"We just have to eliminate little mis-
takes in the ﬁeld and keep pitching well,”
he said. “The hits are there; wejust have to
work on closing some games.”

The Generals travel to Easte1nMenno—
nite on Tuesday. First pitch of that game
is at 3 p.m.

Women’s lax improves record

The Generals defeat Bridgewater but lose to Franklin and Marshall

By Lizz Dye
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee women’s la-
crosse team smashed Bridgewater College
20-4 on the road last Tuesday, but fell to
top-ranked Franklin and Marshall 16-8 on
Saturday.

The 16th-ranked Generals (2-1, 1-0
ODAC) scored eight consecutive goals in
the ﬁrst half of their victory over Bridge-
water and went into half-time leading 8-O.

Senior attacker Britten Mathews, ju-
nior attackers Kate Speare and Ellie Van
Sant, and sophomore attacker Maddie
McKaig all earned hat tricks in the vic-
tory. Mathews and Speare also recorded
an assist apiece. Junior midﬁelder Emmy
Mathews and ﬁrst year midﬁelder Ashley
Barnes scored two goals each, and junior
attacker Wilton Megargel, ﬁrst-year at-
tacks Mary Jennings Van Sant and Eliza-
beth Bucklee, and sophomore midﬁelder
Alexis Harrison scored one goal apiece.

The Generals played both a strong offen-
sive and defensive game.

Junior goalkeeper Katharine F arrar and
ﬁrst-year goalkeeper Alex Hamill each
saved two goals and allowed two goals.

“While Bridgewater is not our strongest
competition, a decisive win really showed
how far we have come as a team since last
week,” said Emmy Matthews.

It was deﬁnitely a strong win for the
Generals and an excellent preview for the
competition the women’s lacrosse team
will bring to the ()DAC tournament.

Facing off against Franklin and Mar-
shall, junior midﬁelder Kate Donnelly put
in the ﬁrst goal for the Generals. F&M
responded by netting ﬁve goals over the
next ten minutes. Sophomore midﬁelder
Christina Benedetti and Mathews added
two more goals in the ﬁrst half. But it
wasn’t enough to take down the Franklin

and Marshall lead, and the Diplomats had
an 8-3 lead at halftime.

Benedetti ﬁnished with three goals.
l)onnelly, Mathews, senior attacker Mere-
dith Freeman, Megargel, and Bucklee also
contributed goals to the ﬁnal score. McK-
aig had an assist. Farrar played the whole
game in net for the Generals and recorded
13 saves.

After the defeat, Mathews said that the
team “has come a long way, but they still
have a long way to go.”

“We know what we need to shoot for
and the aspects of our game we need to
ﬁx before tournament time,” said Emmy
Mathews.

The Generals return to action as they
travel to Sweet Briar for a 4: l 5 p.m.
match-up this Tuesday.
