1897

VOLUME CXIII, NUMBER 16

J ohnsons come
out to play

185 hopeful students

experience collegiate life

By Katy Stewart
smrr wrmsn

Some 185 high school seniors descended on Wash-
ington and Lee’s campus Tuesday for the ﬁnal inter-
views for the Johnson Scholarship, just as Lexington
welcomed its warmest weather in months.

The sunny weather was good news for the Johnson
program, which sets itself apart from other scholarship
programs by hosting ﬁnalists for three days. Just as
applicants look different on paper versus in person,
so do schools. So showcasing Lexington’s beautiful
weather only enhanced W&L’s image. When these
high achievers are choosing between the Ivy League
and W&L, the campus is a key marketing tool.

“The campus sells itself,” said chief scholarship
coordinator Erin Hutchinson, especially when many
students have never visited W&L before. Sitting in
on classes gave prospectives a glimpse into academic

life, and staying in the dorms gave students a chance '

to see what real dorm living is like.

According to admissions director Jonathan Web-
ster, the honor system, leadership, and civic respon-
sibility were the impetus for the Johnson Scholarship,
created three years ago after Rupert Johnson (’62)
donated $100 million, W&L’s largest single donation
to date. These are the qualities that set W&L apart,
and “are the things people love about the school,”
Webster said.

Hutchinson and the admissions team devoted the
last six weeks to organizing interviews and activities
for the ﬁnalists. The team kept ﬁnalists busy, not just
with interviews, but with teambuilding activities and
events designed to showcase W&L.

But the most important part of the week for these
students was the interview process. Finalists were
selected from a pool of about 2,200 applicants, and
all exemplify academic excellence, as well as leader-
ship outside the classroom. The Johnson program is
not looking for “cookie cutter” students, Hutchinson
said. Leadership can be through service, athletics,
work experience or the arts. Johnson Scholars all have
different experiences and backgrounds, Hutchinson
said. The scholarship rewards students who will “bring
something to enrich W&L. Not just to be involved, but
to enrich.” Added admissions director Robert Koch,
“We’re looking for movers and shakers.”

The admissions team has found that more students
apply each year, making selection more competitive.
The biggest change in applicants is the “volume and
depth of the pool,” said admissions director Aaron
Fulk. Of the 2,200 applicants, approximately 10
percent are named as ﬁnalists and invited to campus.
The school offers more Johnson Scholarships than
are accepted, but approximately 35 ‘to 40 enroll.
Feedback from winners who decline includes many
factors, but often points to the intense social scene
and small town.

With higher application rates each year, the team
made changes to the ﬁnalist week in order to accom-
modate the increasingly competitive process. Most no-
tably, the faculty interview and peer interview merged
into one combined panel. Hutchinson said the change
was “appropriate” to the nature of the school and the
scholarship. The school prides itself on student self-
govemance, so current Johnsons should “be involved
in selecting their successors,” she said.

Also, more activities were planned for the ﬁnalists
than the two previous years, with a Student Showcase
and a scavenger hunt. The Showcase was opened to
the entire student body and featured W&L favorites
like Southern Comfort, the school’s all-male a capella
group. The scavenger hunt encouraged students both
to ﬁnd out more about W&L and Lexington, and to
work together as a team to solve the clues.

Bringing an additional 1 85 people onto campus cre-
ated challenges. The team coordinated each student’s
travel itinerary and planned class visits that matched
each student’s indicated academic interests. In order to
do this, admissions staff had to clear particular classes
with professors. An intricate puzzle was ﬁtting extra
students into classrooms because “we don’t have big
classrooms,” Hutchinson said. For example, Profes-
sor Brian Richardson’s Journalism 101 class, which
usually seats 16 students, more than doubled when 20
Johnson ﬁnalists sat it on Wednesday morning.

The Johnson Scholarship presents a unique oppor-
tunity, offering a merit-based scholarship to approxi-
mately 10 percent of the incoming class. The scope of
this grant, relative to the size of the student body, sets
the Johnson apart from other scholarships. Hutchinson
ﬁnds the selection process rewarding because it makes
the school available to anyone, regardless of ability or
willingness to pay. “After living the W&L experience,
think how thankful they are to have this opportunity,
thanks to the Johnson,” she said.

Drug

takes a hi

. SJC drops constructive possession
cases and plans to rethink the policy

for next year

By Kelsy Mccraw
STAFF WRITER

A I4-student case brought before
the Student Judicial Council involving
illegal drugs has forced the council
members to rethink the newly exposed
“constructive possession” policy.

The case emerged several weeks
ago. From the outset, it sparked a
huge level of student concern and
media attention.

The students, who will remain
anonymous because of a conﬁdential-
ity code enforced by the SJC, received
sanctions because they were found in
the same room as other students who
were using drugs.

These students, who were not
using drugs themselves, felt unfairly
convicted because they were unaware
ofthis policy.

‘:We really weren’t worried about
our case until our honor advocates
told us about the idea of constructive
possession,” said one of the students
who was involved in the case. “ltjust
seems unfair that we got punished for
something we didn’t know about.”

Under the constructive possession
policy, students are held accountable
for being in an enclosed room with
full knowledge of illegal activity such
as drug use.

The SJC began consistently using
the policy this year. However, the
policy does not appear in the student

polic

handbook due to an oversight by the
SJC.

The SJC dropped the possession
charges for those 12 of the 14 students
who had been convicted under the
premise of constructive possession.
The decision was announced late last
Monday afternoon.

Crighton Allen, chairman of the
SJC, acknowledged that the policy

dent. “I didn’t possess any drugs."

Upon further reflection of the
policy, the SJC has decided to stop
using constructive possession until a
better, clearer policy can be laid out
to students.

The philosophy behind the policy
is still something that the SJC will
incorporate into the handbook next
year. Nevertheless, the terminology

“I do want to see a decrease in drug use on

campus, but that just wash ’1‘ the way to do it.

J

T hat 3 just not fair. ’

CRIGHTON ALLEN, SJC Chairman . .
 

was unfair. He also said it proved to
be ineffective.

‘‘[It] doesn’t deter people who.

were going to do bad things. It only
punishes people who weren’t,” he
said.

One of the students whose cases
were dropped said that the SJC’s
reevaluation of the constructive pos-
session cases came as a relief.

‘‘I’m very relieved,” said this stu-

and charge will be different.

Right now, the SJC wants to move
away from the term “constructive pos-
session,” because it implies some sort
ofpossession when none has actually
occurred.

With this implication, students in
the same room as other students using
illegal substances had been officially
found guilty of possession. The only
differentiation between “constructive

  
 

possession” and actual possession was
made in terms of sanctions.

Allen said the SJC might change
the charge of possession to a charge
of conduct unbecoming of a W&L
student. He is currently discussing the
issue with Associate Dean of Students
Brandon Dotson. The two will reach a
decision on how to handle these kinds
of cases by next year.

There will be an addendum in next
year’s handbook that will explain the
policy and how cases of this nature
will be handled.

While “constructive possession”
has been shelved for the time being,
Allen said that the SJC and the ad-
ministration remain adamant in their
stance against illegal substances.

“I do want to see a decrease in drug
use on campus, but that just wasn’t
the way to do it. That’sjust not fair,”
he said.

Writer’s tale of poverty

Annual Tom Wolfe speaker takes on “Hardship, Resilience and the Art of the Memoir”

By Randi Wilson
STAFF WRITER

Jeannette Walls was once a ce-
lebrity gossip columnist who went
to fancy dinners, galas and other
schmooze-worthy functions.

While walking to one of these
events, she saw her mother on the
streetﬁhomeless.

When Walls asked her what she
should say when people asked about
her, she replied, “Just tell the truth.”

It is this scene that grabs the read-
er in the opening scene of her mem-
oir, “The Glass Castle,” which she
recounted to her audience at the Tom
Wolfe Weekend Seminar on Friday.

The truth, Walls said, was that she
had spent 15 years like that.

“I grew up po’—we couldn’t even
afford the last two letters.”

It took her 20 years to come for-
ward with her story. She was afraid
that by telling the world that she was
not raised in a wealthy home, she
would lose the place she had created
for herself in society. But her moth-
er’s words stuck with her.

She faced countless challenges in
writing the memoir. For instance, she
was unsure how to depict her mother,
whose optimism was so blinding that
she didn’t realize how terrible life
was for her children.

“Things will always work out in
the end,” her mother would say.

“Well what if they don’t, mom?”
Walls would ask.

“Then you haven’t reached the
end yet,” her mother would reply.

Another challenge was that at
times she found her storytelling
voice would default into a journal-
istic voiee. It was an unconscious
defense.

In the early 1990s, Cumming was
ajournalist for The Atlanta Journal-
Constitution and worked on a section
of“News for Kids” in which the ﬁrst
Gulf War was explained in a way
that eight year-olds could easily un-
derstand.

It was a favorite section of peo-
ple of all ages because it was ﬁlled

“We can understand our stories better by

I

hearing others ’. ’

t

Jeannette Walls, author and keynote speaker

Walls wouldn’t tell the reader how
to feel, but rather tell them, “This
is what happened. Make up your
own mind.” She would also write
“as though it happened to someone
else.”

Associate Professor of Journal-
ism Doug Cumming, who attended
the lecture, did not agree that the two
writing styles are necessarily differ-
ent.

“Good journalism is good story-
telling,” Cumming said.

with clear facts without unnecessary
“gobbledygook.” They contained
a “basic eternal truth” which could
connect to adults and children alike,
Cumming said.
Cumming

said that a writer

doesn’t need to tell readers what her
work should mean to them. But read-
ers must be able to understand what
they are reading for it to mean any-
thing.

Walls wanted her story to be un-
derstood by more than just adults.

“We can understand our stories bet-
ter by hearing others’,” she said.

Her dream in sharing her story
was that she would be understood
by at least two people~one was a
wealthy child who could learn what
life was like on the other side of the
tracks, and the other was a child like
her, for whom her book could be “a
glimmer of hope.”

Both came true.

And while her story wasn’t al-
ways happy, it was always the real
story.

Walls stopped worrying about the
shame of her youth and whether she
would lose herjob or her friends, and
published “The Glass Castle.” lt sold
more than two million copies, and it
was written as much for her audience
as it was for herself.

“You shape your truths by the sto-
ries you tell,” Walls said.

The annual Tom Wolfe Weekend
Seminar is sponsored by the W&L .
Class of 1951 in honor oftheir class-
mate, author Tom Wolfe.

Nancy’s rampage and ObamaCare blindly plow forward

Regardless of public opinion, the Democrats will stop at nothing to get their version of health care reform passed.

By Jarrett Brotzman
c 0 L U M N IS T

Democrats are starting to feel
a bit uneasy after this past week,
as President Barack Obama
ramped up political and media
pressure on dissenters of his
healtch care reform plans while
Speaker Nancy Pelosi went vote
bartering, offering special legis-
lative treats.

Why can’t these unsure Dem-
ocratic congressmen shut their
mouths and just vote?

But amid the overly generous
pork that Pelosi, White House
Chief of Staff strong-arm Rahm
Emanuel and the rest of the gang
are dishing out (my favorite: the
“Gator Aid” that singles out and
exempts over 800,000 Florida
seniors from key Medicare cuts
in the current Senate bill), some
Democrats just aren’t biting.

The ﬁscal concerns related to
this bill have made many moder-
ates uneasy. Ofﬁcial claims from
the White House estimate the to-
tal cost of the entire ObamaCare
bill to cost around $950 billion
over the next 10 years.

To make the deal even sweet-
er, the package will be paid for
by cuts to health—care providers
and “various tax increases.”

The whole thing sounds pret-
ty rosy, until you wonder how
it would be possible to say that
much money when you have spe-
ciﬁcally exempted over 800,000
seniors in Florida alone. Some-
thing isn’t adding up.

Some more moderate Demo-
crats are unsure about many of
the proposed components of this
overhaul, not least of all the ban-
ning of illegal immigrants from
purchasing private insurance and
loosening federal restrictions on
the funding of abortions.

Several Dems are not-too-
slowly backing away from this
ever-growing monstrosity. For
Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D., IL), he
says he can no longer stand by
the ObamaCare reform. He was
quoted last Friday on the subject
saying, “If we bar the immigrant
community from buying private
insurance with their own money,

we relegate them to emergency-
room care at the highest cost to
taxpayers” (WSJ, 3/13). Interest-
ingly enough, he initially voted
for the House version of health-
care reform last year.

True to form, Pelosi is charg-
ing on with her vote-scrounging
treasure hunt—continuing to ig-
nore the pleas from her own par-
ty to slow down and negotiate. It
was reported that Ms. Pelosi just
gave up on around a dozen mod-
erate pro-life Democrats led by
Rep. Bart Stupak (D., MI).

This move is a risky gamble,
considering how she is quickly
running out of people to ignore.
She might want to get started on
the 37 House Democrats who
voted NO on last year’s health-
care bill. I can only imagine the
kind of pork they’ll need to be
convinced.

Many in Washington seem
convinced that this vote will
pass. Senior White House Advi-
sor David Axelrod, Obama and
Press Secretary Robert Gibbs are

all convinced this vote will go
their way.

But they aren’t voting on the
bill, and several other factors in
play might be enough to hold
back its passage. The GOP has
publicly urged a scrapping of
the entire bill and a bipartisan
restart. A seemingly reasonable
request, except that the GOP
knows that if they were to restart
the healthcare reform process,
nothing substantial would get
passed; exactly the position they
want to be in heading towards
the midterms.

The Democrats know it too,
and that’s why Pelosi has all but
ignored Boehner’s and Pence’s
bipartisan cries.

The Hispanic Caucus also
seems to have an issue or two
with some provisions in the cur-
rent Senate version. After meet-
ing with Obama last week, sev-
eral are still unconvinced that a
vote to constrain access to some
insurance to full citizens is the
morally just vote. The vast ma-

jority of the Hispanic Caucus is
still for the Senate version, but
every dissenting vote the nays
pick up will make it even more
difficult to ram this bill through
the House.

But wait, there’s more. This
week Senator Chris Dodd (D.,
CT) is expected to unveil his
tough new ﬁnancial regulation
bill. There must have been some
back room ﬁghting on this one,
as Dodd seems to be stealing
some of the momentum and po-
litical capital from fellow Demo-
crats in their moment of need.
His timing seems a bit odd; I can
only speculate that he wants to
leave some sort of legacy leg-
islation. His choice of ﬁnancial
regulation is a bit ironic, consid-
ering his past history with Coun-
trywide Financial. Perhaps his
bill contains special language for
preferential treatment of ﬁnance
ﬁrms that give cheap loans to ex-
Massachusetts Senators.

The noise from Washington
seems to be painting two very

different pictures. On one side,
the Democratic elite seem very
conﬁdent the bill will pass, with
Gibbs going so far as to say that
soon “it will be the law of the
land.” Other Democrats are not
so sure. While Rep. James Cly-
burn (D., SC) seems conﬁdent
that even though “we don’t have
the votes as of this morning...
[but] I am very conﬁdent that we
will get this done” (NBC, “Meet
the Press”), House Education
and Labor Committee Chairman
George Miller (D., CA), when
asked about the Democratic
votes, said “There’s a lot of work
to do” (WSJ, 3/13).

Even Patrick Caddell and
Douglas Schoen, both pollsters
for Presidents Carter and Clin-
ton, agree “the horse has left the
barn” (Washington Post, 3/12).

Who knows? Perhaps Eman-
uel can gently persuade some
dissenting Dems to change their
minds. When votes are for sale
like they are today, anything
seems possible.

Native American reservations are ignored and underfunded

After volunteering at an Indian reservation in high school,

By Barbara Knipp
C0 LU M NIST

My senior year of high school
we were instructed to organize a
senior project where we would
work as an intern at the place of
our choice.

I decided to visit an Indian
reservation and do volunteer
work there. After doing some re-
search online, I decided on doing
a program called Re-Member at
the Pine Ridge ‘Reservation in
South Dakota.

The program combined vol-
unteer work with education, as I

learned both how to build beds
and a lot about Native American
history. We would stay on the
site and build beds in the mom-
ing, and then go deliver them to
the homes of people in need.
Delivering beds and touring
the reservation, I was exposed
to the truth of the reservation.
The poverty level on the reserva-
tion is the worst that I had ever
seen. The majority of the popu-
lation on the reservation lived in
FEMA trailers that were falling
apart. Drug and alcohol abuse
were pervasive, gang graffiti

decorated most of the buildings
and stray dogs, called “res dogs,”
wandered the streets.

One of the most moving days
during my stay was one when
we delivered beds to a house in
a run-down residential neighbor-
hood. When we arrived there was
a dead dog lying in the street and
the house was in shambles.

Upon entering, we found all
of the rooms entirely bare except
for a dirty mattress on the ﬂoor,
one wall covered in family pho-
tographs, and one chair with an
elderly woman hooked up to a

breathing machine. We cleaned
the rooms and took the mattress
away, leaving in its place two
twin beds with sheets and com-
forters.

Located in the Badlands of
South Dakota, the Pine Ridge
Reservation held little promise
for a prosperous future. There is
an overall tone of hopelessness
that was evident in the bleak
landscape, run down homes and
shops, and symbols of gang vio-
lence.

The conditions of the Indian
Reservation were little known to

me. The fact that it is at a third-
world poverty level was com-
pletely surprising to me, as my
education up until that point had
never addressed more than the
“Trail of Tears” after European
colonization.

I was taught that Indians were
a thing of the past, but my trip
to the reservation showed that
was far from true. After listening
to several of the speakers on the
reservation, visiting sacred sites
and learning about Indian cul-
ture, I realized that despite the
bleak atmosphere and poverty,

Barbara Knipp ’s eyes were opened to domestic injustice

there was still a strong and proud
spirit and pride that ran through-
out parts of the reservation.

The trip really opened my
eyes to how I only know what I
am taught, and despite the good
education that I have been fortu-
nate enough to receive, I am still
ignorant to many interesting is-
sues in the world. I found it sad
how little people know about
Indians, considering they were a
major part of the development of
our country and their culture has
so much to offer.

Tweaking and perfecting drug discipline at W&L

While the current disciplinary system has had some success, the school can do more to condemn the real bad guys

By Stockton Bullitt
C 0 L U M N I S T

Drug use has become the new
sexual assault at Washington and
Lee: everyone is talking about it.

Recent high-proﬁle arrests
and publicity surrounding cer-
tain controversial SJC laws have
made the city of Lexington seem
like Miami, or at least Sigma Nu
in the ’80s. Drug-related arrests
and SJC hearings have skyrock-
eted.

But what does this really
mean? Is the administration re-
ally cleaning up drug use in Lex-
ington? Are the distributers like
Peter Martinez the primary ones
getting affected?

Well... kind of. Like any drug
initiative at any school, the re-
sults are relatively mixed.

Yes, the administration does
get its hands on the occasional
big-time dealer, but usually the
one big-name dealer comes in
tandem with a plethora of people
who were simply at the wrong
place at the wrong time.

I ﬁnd it hard tocritique the
administration and SJC for step-
ping up efforts to enforce drug
use. It’s a noble cause, but, like
most other disciplinary bodies,
they tend to lose sight of their
original goal and simply settle
for prosecuting whomever they
can get their hands on, so that
they can send a message to the
rest of the student body.

My problem with this strategy
is that too many dumb ﬁrst-years
who are dabbling into something
shouldn’t usually bear the brunt
of the discipline and suffer too
harsh a consequence as a result.

To alleviate this problem, I
have devised an alternative to
the current system of respond-
ing to drug use at W&L. I won’t
delude myself—or you, for that
matter—into thinking that this
idea will ever come to fruition,
mostly because it takes too much
work and discretion.

Yet I think it is the outlook
that the administration and SJC
should have when it comes to

drugs in Lexington.

First, let’s answer why there
is drug discipline at W&L in the
ﬁrst place. I believe that disci-
plining students for drug use
serves two purposes: “protecting
the students from harm they can
do to themselves, and protecting
fellow students from damages
that could come from another
student’s intoxication or by sell-
ing the drug to others.

trades work in pyramids: there
are a few suppliers at the top who
distribute to the dealers who then
sell marked—up product to regu-
lars and experimenters alike.

The school needs to treat each
of these four groups separately to
achieve its goal.

Let’s start with the ﬁrst group,
the experimenters. These kids

are made up of casual users, (i.e.~

twice a semester), people trying

I believe that disciplining students for

drug use serves two purposes.‘ protect-

ing the students from harm they can do

to themselves, and protecting fellow

students from damages that could come’

from another students intoxication or by

selling drugs to others. V
 

While W&L takes both these
problems seriously, the school is
much more concerned with the
second. If an intoxicated student
badly injures another, the school
is not in great shape. I get that.

So, in line with those prin-
ciples, the best plan for W&L to
take is to take out the supply and
to dissuade potential experiment-
ers from trying the speciﬁc drug.
This will produce the best results
because if everyone is afraid to
sell drugs and there are minimal
new users, then the trade at W&L
quickly evaporates.

The next issue is actually ﬁg-
uring out how we are going to
get rid of the main suppliers and
minimize the new users.

This can be done with disci-
plining the drug trade the same

Off-campus parties not safe

Washington and Lee needs to come to grips with reality
and start thinking about the students ’safety

By Abel Delgado
co LUM NIST

Throughout the better part of
the last four years, I have wit?
nessed Washington and Lee ad-
ministrators make mostly well-
guided decisions in trying to
improve the W&L environment
outside the classroom. While the
success of different initiatives
and events has varied, we can al-
ways tell the administration had
good intentions and the student
body’s interest in mind.

The growing push to move
more parties off campus has
me worried this is no longer the

case, however, and I fear school.

ofﬁcials do not see the current

but W&L is in no way the only
campus where the drinking age
is largely ignored.

Obviously, the W&L admin-
istration should not openly pro-
mote law-breaking. However,
when I was a freshman, I was
under the impression that if I
was at an on-campus party and
not being belligerent, what was
in my red cup did not matter to
the campus security or to any
other school ofﬁcial. This now
seems to be the case for only off-
campus problems. '

A slew of on-campus parties
have been shut down earlier than

A slew of on-campus parties have been

shut down earlier than is customary this

year Other parties have not been

approved to be held on campus.

and future consequences of their
decisions. '

Drinking is a part of the
culture at W&L. Anyone who
doesn’t accept that just does not
accept reality. This doesn’t mean
that we should accept the jerks
who act irresponsibly and use
“blacking-out” as an excuse, but
as long as W&L students act re-
sponsibly, their drinking should

. be solely their concern.

Granted, there’s a liability
problem since about half the stu-
dent body is under the absurd
legal drinking age, and about
the same half lives on campus,

is customary this year. Other
parties have not been approved
to be held on campus. Just last
week, on-campus parties during
the Johnson Scholars visit were
rejected.

It is beyond me why school
officials would attempt to hide
a common W&L occurrence, a
Wednesday party, from our pro-
spective students. Do they think
these students are not respon-
sible enough to make proper de-
cisions about partying now, but
will be in September?

If anything, we should expose
these students to everything the

W&L social scene has to offer. It
is better to ﬁnd out now whether
or not they can handle it, rather
than later.

Again, I understand this is a
legal liability issue in a country
where suing someone for your
own irresponsibility is all too

' common, but that doesn’t mean

we can hide reality. V

This past week, as they have
for most this year, W&L student
have predictably responded to

on-campus party hostility by_

moving nearly all their parties
away from campus. This means
the school has no liability, but
because of that decision, the
school is left without any control
of what happens.

What does this lead to? This
leads to students acting less re-
sponsibly, not more. This leads
to more students getting arrested
for plenty of things that students
wouldn’t dare to do openly on
campus, but are becoming com-
monplace off campus.

If the administrators achieve
their goal of pushing parties
off campus, they can expect
more students to get arrested for
drugs, drunk driving and for be-
ing drunk in public. Worse of all,
they can expect sexual assaults
to go up.

They can also expect many
students who go too far and need
a trip to the health center, not to
get one.

This reality is clearly not
what the administration, trustees

or parents want. Therefore, it’s

time for them to rethink their on-
campus party policies.

aware of the detrimental con-
sequences. This is where Dean
Dotson, who already does a great
job making students aware ofthe
consequences, can go further.

Look, I’ve met Dean Dotson.
He’s a really nice guy, but he is
alsojacked and has a deep voice.
Since he is so nice and under-
standing, he probably wouldn’t
go as far as bringing every single
one ofthe experimenters to tears,
but that’s what he and the SJC
should be doing. They should
view every dry check on these
kids’ faces as a failure.

I don’t say this because I want
water boarding allowed at W& L,
but if every student who leaves
an SJC hearing can only mutter,
“Well there’s no freaking way
I’m ever doing that drug again,”
then they have done theirjobs.

The point can be made even
further with parent involvement.
Instead of sending a letter, how
about calling the parents? What
student wouldn’t care if his or
her grandma called to talk about
why he or she thinks it’s cool to
smoke pot in a dormitory bath-
room? Families are by far the
best at scaring the shit out of
their kids. Why not utilize that?

However, besides scaring
the experimenters, I don’t re-
ally think much else needs to be
done in the form of punishment.
If the students then won’t do it
again, why make their lives too
difﬁcult?

On the hand, harsher punish-
ments can be doled out ifthe stu-
dent refuses to give information
about his or her source. Getting
names is critical with experi-
menters, because they will give
up the names.

But wait~W&L certainly is
not ﬁlled with narcs, and there
is no way anyone at W&L would
rat out a friend.

Well, that wasn’t supposed to
be the case in the real world, yet
it still seems to happen. So why
not use some of the provenly ef-

fective methods?

Students will be much more
likely to give a source if their
punishments are reduced. Why
not have different punishments
for people who give information

~ and for people who don’t? And

why not let the parents know if
their kids don’t feel like cooper-
ating? They’d love to hear that.

Also, if the students don’t
give correct information or don’t
feel like cooperating whatsoever,
there’s always the handy dandy
honor code to turn to. No matter
how you do it, some kind of evi-
dence ofa dealer should come out
of talking to an experimenter.

Now, on to the regular users.
For these offenders, the school
should probably be thinking
about getting the students to stop
harming themselves on a regular
basis—but once again, we’ve all
had plenty of education in our
lives. So how do you do it?

You take up their time. Repet-
itive drug use primarily evolves
out of free time, so to take away
the drug use, you take away the
free time. Assigning community
service or work orders is not
strange to Rockbridge County;
why should it be for W&L? I’m
sure that maintenance would love
a little help around campus.

Since the regulars have been
usingdrugs for a while, they will
most likely know who does what
within the pyramid, so getting
them to talk isjust as vital.

Working your way up the
pyramid, you get to drug dealers.
Now, here’s where I have a prob-
lem with the zero tolerance poli-
cy at W&L and other schools.

While most of the dealers on
campus should be reprimanded
for distribution, they do not
necessarily need to be expelled.
Most of them treasure being here
just as much as everyone else.

The key with this group is to
get them to prove their dedica-
tion to W&L. Put them so close
to expulsion that they feel its im-

pending pressure, but don’t au-
tomatically kick them‘ out. That
way, the people who want to
stay will still get a great educa-
tion, and those who don’t value
W&L will eventually get what’s
coming to them. Plus, those who
want to stay will become the best
allies, and W&L can at least say
they tried with the others.

The ultimate goal of dealing
with the bottom three groups
should be getting the last group.

Obtaining information about -
Lexington’s premier drug suppli-
ers should be the focus of every
hearing, interview or even casual
conversation with the ﬁrst three
groups.

You want to end any sem-
blance of drug culture in Lex-
ington? You get the engine to the
system: the suppliers.

LexPo hasn’t been afraid
to go after these guys, and I’m
guessing that they would love
information about them. If the
W&L discipline system produc-
es names, times and dates, I’m
guessing results will happen, and
LexPo might ﬁnally get around
to trusting students.

So, people responsible for
disciplining students at W&L,
what’s wrong with this plan?
Where are the loopholes?

From high school on, I have
seen way too many kids who
were stuck in the wrong place at
the wrong time get screwed by
systems that like to catch the lit-
tle guy—and use that to advertise
alleged results, rather than spend
the time and the effort catching
the big guys.

I know that W&L’s process
for stopping the drug trade is no-

, ticeably better than most institu-

tions, but that doesn’t mean the
system can’t still be improved..

I mean, you don’t necessar-
ily need to END IT. Just THINK
ABOUT IT.

KEWl..’s Body Week is back again

KEWL is Love Your Body Week returns after its racy PostSecret campaign last year generated campus controversy

By Findley Merritt
STAFF WRITER

“I have never hooked up so-
berly with anyone.”

That was a PostSecret that
sparked waves of similar and
startling confessions last year
amid KEWL’s Love Your Body
Week. ’

This week, KEWL (Knowl-
edge Empowering Women Lead-
ers) and END IT, a group that
came out of fall term’s Sexual
Assault Prevention Workshop,
revive the PostSecret campaign
armed with posters, T-shirts, and
new projects for Love Your Body
Week.

LYBW dedicates a week to
empowering women by high-
lighting prevalent issues women

\ face universally and speciﬁcally

at Washington and Lee.

The goal is to build momen-
tum and mobilize the community
around issues like sexual assault.

But controversy over last
year’s PostSecret campaign—a
project that involved W&L com-
munity members writing their
secrets on postcards—created a
roadblock this year.

KEWL President Catherine
Kruse, a junior, explained that

some members of the W&L
community felt the posts were
inappropriate and too visible.

END IT President Emily
Coyle, a senior, added that the
group didn’t expect PostSecret to
take the direction that it did.

Candid comments on the
postcards revealed that W&L stu-
dents deal with issues normally
considered too taboo to discuss,
such as the hookup culture, body
image and sexuality.

“It was pretty illustrative of
how we actually are on campus,”
said Coyle.

The secrets were posted in the
John Elrod Commons stairwell
where people became concerned
over potential trafﬁc hazards,
as many community members
would gather at all hours of the
day to read the dozens of shock-
ingly truthful postcards.

This year’s PostSecrets are
restricted to the Commons Liv-
ing Room because students can
speciﬁcally reserve that space.

There will be tables in the
Commons for students to write
their anonymous confessions
and slip them in boxes to be dis-

played together later.

Last year’s PostSecrets were
displayed this fall in a niche on
the main ﬂoor of Leybum Li-
brary.

In addition to the PostSecret
campaign, KEWL and END IT
will start the Clothes Line Proj-
ect, an effort that usually high-
lights domestic violence but will
this year be devoted to sexual
assault.

about the prevalence of the issue
on campus. '

KEWL and END IT are co-
sponsoring a speaker from Am-
nesty International, Project Ho-
rizon and Women for Women
International on Wednesday.

Project Horizon is a local
organization dedicated to reduc-
ing domestic, dating and sexual
violence in the Rockbridge area.
Women for Women International

“Some feel that the way we emphasize

women is issues brings men down, but it’s

about bringing women up. ”

Lule Rault, sophomore END IT member
 

On Cannan Green, students
will decorate T-shirts with their
handprints if they’ve experi-
enced or known someone who
has experienced sexual assault.

“The T-shirts dry on a clothes

New tunes roundup

Washington and Lee ’s only radio station

shares sweet music from the studio

By WLUR Staff
STAFF WRITERS

Some of our staffers give you
some suggestions for tunes to
help you spring into spring:

Joanna Newsom

Have One On Me (Drag City)

Leading up to its release, much
talk about Joanna Newsom’s third
album, Have One On Me, focused
on its spectacular length—this
whole three-album ensemble
clocks in at over two hours. As it
turns out, that’s a lot of music, so
it’s tough to succinctly articulate
some commentary on my diges-
tion of it so far. I think that despite
Have One On Me’s epic length,
Newsom’s previous record Ys is
a more epic album. How can you
get more vast than all that harp
and those dense, sweeping swing
arrangements? J oanna’s totally in-
sane voice? Everything all knotty
and delicate? I say that not to fault
Have One On Me in any way, but
to draw attention to how different
its palette is: brass, woodwinds,
acoustic guitar, banjo and man-
dolin. The whole thing is so ma-
ture, so womanly, so American,
so thoughtful and precise. Add
to that Joanna’s voice—which
is now, somehow, all warm like
milk and honey—and it’s no sur-
prise that the album brought me
to tears in a couple of places.

A good entry point for some-
one less mushy over her is “Good
Intentions Paving Company,” a
fun driving song. My other fa-
vorites are the more “epic” ones:
“Easy,” “Soft As Chalk” and “On
A Good Day.” '

Frightened Rabbit
The Winter of Mixed Drinks
(FatCat)

There’s a certain class of rock
that I think of as “grown up,”
something about the vocals and
stylings. This category includes
groups like The Hold Steady, Cal-
ifone and The National. I think
Frightened Rabbit ﬁts in there as
well. The earnest, thoughtful, en-
ergetic and polished rock of The
Winter of Mixed Drinks will like-
ly attract a wide variety of fans.
(And that’s not even to mention
its catchy pop appeal.)

AAM, the group’s promoter,
tells us: “Glasgow-based Fright-
ened Rabbit are releasing their
third LP to towering expecta-
tions... Written during singer/
songwriter Scott Hutchinson’s

self-imposed exile to the seclud-
ed seaside hamlet Crail on Scot- .
land’s Fife coastline, The Winter
of Mixed Drinks is speckled with
nautical metaphor and imbued

with themes of human isolation,
resilience and the moumful tri-
umph of mortality. Though its
subject matter often skews to-
wards the dark, redemption—in
the form of a joyful choral burst,
chiming guitar line, or orchestral
swell—is never far away.”

Find redemption with “The
Wrestle” or “Living in Color.”

Ted Leo & the Pharmacists
The Brutalist Bricks
(Matador)

Ted Leo is now on Matador Re-
cords, becoming thesecond indie
powerhouse to sign to the venera-
ble imprint—see Pavement, Yo La
Tengo, Belle & Sebastian and The
New Pornographers on the active

rosterwin recent months. (Oh,'

and Sonic Youth put out its ﬁrst
Matador album, The Eternal, last
year.) The expectations are high
for anything that Leo touches, but
it’s hard to imagine making a bet-
ter debut on one’s new label than
The Brutalist Bricks, his strongest
effort since the 2001/2003 com-
bo The Tyranny of Distance ‘and
Hearts of Oak. '

While a couple of tracks on
Leo’s previous LP, 2007’s Living
With the Living, might claim a
spot on Ted’s proverbial greatest
hits album, the record as a whole
was disappointing. Luckily, The
Brutalist Bricks does almost ev-
erything right that Living got
wrong. If you’re not roped in by
the ﬁrst 15 seconds of opener “The
Mighty Sparrow,” then you’re
clearly in the wrong genre. There
are many more gems throughout,
from the aggressively melodic
“Bottled in Cork” to the thunder-
ing “Where Was My Brain?” to
lead single “Even Heroes Have
to Die.” Not that the other mate-
rial is ﬁller, either; throughout the
record, Leo showcases his ﬁne
songwriting, and the Pharmacists
(Chris Wilson on drums, James
Canty on guitar and keyboards
,and new member Marty Key on
bass) are in ﬁne‘ form. And what
can you say about Ted, but that
the dude can shred the guitar?
One of 20l0’s best.

focuses on teaching life skills to
women from third-world coun-
tries who have been victims of
war crimes.

Kruse explained that KEWL
has close ties with Project Hori-
zon because some W&L students
volunteer with the shelter or 24-
hour hotline now.

These organizations inﬂu-
enced KEWL’S poster campaign
for LYBW.

This year’s posters feature
facts about great things W&L
women are doing every day.

“It’s about celebrating
strength,” said Kruse.

KEWL is also bringing back
the foam cutouts of women from
last year, emphasizing all dif-
ferent body types and shapes,
adding focus to every aspect of
women.

Lastly, “indulgence day” asks
W&L women to forgo makeup,
wear comfortable sweats and
pick up free treats on Friday.

“We want women to feel
comfortable and conﬁdent so
that they realize they belong at
W&L,” said Kruse.

Coyle said she believes more
dialogue about women’s issues
like sexual assault need to take
place on campus.

“It was clear when packages
of reforms came through the

ISFHB Ad Hoc Committee that

an overhaul of the existing struc-
ture was necessary,” Coyle said.
But despite successes, some

people still criticize the LYBW
campaign.

“Some feel that the way
we emphasize women’s issues
brings men down,” said sopho-
more END IT member Lule
Rault, “but it’s about bringing
women up.”

Kruse reiterated that it’s .not
an either-or situation, although
there is an evident gender dis-
connect.

“Many blame the Greek sys-
tem for the lack of communica-
tion [between genders], but these
problems would still exist with-
out it,” said Rault. “We’re just
trying to alleviate some of that
aggression.”

96 teams: Madness or insanity?

Columnist Adam Cancryn analyzes the NCAA is proposal to expand its tournament from 64 to 96 teams

By Adam Cancryn
COLUMNIST

March Madness is certainly in full
swing, but not where you might expect it.
While 64 teams prepare to take the court
in pursuit of a national championship,
the NCAA is busy chasing its own holy
grail, one that could radically change the
way we view the Tournament.

In early February, officials began
exploring the possibility of expanding
the NCAA Tournament from 64 to 96
teams. The most likely scenario would
involve absorbing the NIT, adding more
host locations and granting the No. 1
seeds ﬁrst-round byes.

The NCAA argues that doing this
would give mid-majors a better chance
to make the tourney. In addition, it would
increase the percentage of overall teams
that qualify to levels on par with other
collegiate sports. In the current format,
just 19 percent of basketball teams is se-
lected for the NCAA Tournament. That
is lower than Division I baseball (21
percent), soccer (24 percent) and all of
the major pro sports.

Yet while these reasons might sound
valid on the surface, they are seriously
ﬂawed.

Based on N1Tology.com’s March 11
projections, 11 of the 32 NIT qualiﬁers
this year will come from the six power
conferences. Add that to the eight auto-
bids given to conference champions,
and there are just 13 slots available to
lesser—known teams. And that is pro-
vided every power conference team on
the NCAA Tournament bubble is chosen
and not knocked down to the NIT.

Were the NIT added onto the NCAA
Tournament, the result would be a ﬁeld
that might, at the most, include a few
second- and third-place ﬁnishers in
strong mid-major conferences. The rest
of the additional slots would go to power
conference teams. Simple expansion is
certainly not enough to balance out such
ingrained conference domination.

Besides, all that assumes that admit-
ting these extra teams is good for the
tourney’s general health. The NCAA

Tournament is typically viewed as a des-
tination for collegiate basketball’s elite,
a goal to work toward and earn through
solid conference play and an impressive
overall record. In the past two years,
just 50 of the combined I28 tournament
teams qualiﬁed with 10+ regular season
losses. Half of those were only eligible
because they won their respective con-
ference tournament.

Expanding the ﬁeld would signiﬁ-
cantly increase the number of double-
digit loss teams. In the best case, the
result would be a sizable talent gap be-
tween the elite and the mediocre teams.
This would emerge early, the favorites
would advance, and we would end up
with Sweet 16s and Elite 8s no different
than if it were a 64-team bracket.

The worst case is this year. There are
no top-ﬂight teams, leaving us with a
bottom-heavy ﬁeld full of schools that
normally would not enter tournament
discussion. Were this year’s bracket to
permit 96 teams, NC State (18-14, 5-11

in the ACC), North Carolina (16-16, 5-
11 in the ACC) and UConn(l7-15, 7-11
in the Big East) would all likely qualify.
Not only would mid-majors still be left
out, but the bracket would also be satu-
rated with underachieving, undeserving
power conference teams.

Yet despite the negative effect ex-
pansion would have on the tournament’s
competitive balance and prestige, there
is a good chance this change could occur
within the year.

The NCAA’s l 1-year, $6 billion tele-
vision contract with CBS carries an opt-
out clause available at the end of this
season. Conveniently, the NCAA’s deal
with the NIT also expires this year. In
anticipation of both, CBS and Turner
Sports are discussing a joint-bid for a
new contract. ESPN is also reportedly
prepared to make a play for tourney TV
rights.

Expanding to a 96-team ﬁeld would
not just push bidding to record highs.
It would also provide the winning cor-

poration with a chance to re-brand the
tournament.

Furthermore, from a ground-level
ticket sales standpoint, the math is sim-
ple: more games equals more host loca-
tions equals more paying fans equals
more income.

And that is how the NCAA has come
to see its end-of-year championship
games: numbers on a sheet that all add
up to huge proﬁts.

Never mind the physical and psycho-
logical toll it might take on the student-
athletes that spend a month absent from
school while traveling the country, play-
ing more games than ever before.

Never mind the overload of ultimate-
ly meaningless opening round games or
the fact that expansion ﬁxes none of the
current competitive balance issues that
continue to exist.

There are proﬁts to be made. To ig-
nore that would be madness.

Baseball continues roller coaster

The Generals fell to Eastern Mennonite, 1 0-2, but knocked off Greensboro, 11-4, to go 1-1 over the week

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

It was another up and down week for
the Washington and Lee baseball team
as they lost to Eastern Mennonite Uni-
versity, 10-2, but defeated Greensboro
College, 11-4. The Generals can hit and
pitch with the best of them, but finding
consistency has been an issue.

The results of their games since
March 3 read like this: win, loss, win ,
loss, win. The team is brimming with
talent, but it cannot yet ﬁnd that missing
piece needed to string together a couple
of wins. Right now, W&L’s record stands
at 3-6 with a 1-2 conference record.

On Tuesday, W&L traveled to Har-
risonburg to face off with James Madi-
son. Senior pitcher Nate Adkins got the
start for the Generals and struck out the
side in the ﬁrst, but took the loss after
only one inning of work. The Royals

tagged him for six runs in the ﬁrst in-
ning, thanks to two run doubles by Cody
Davis and Dylan Smith.

The situation did not get any better
for W&L. Royals pitcher Jason Tate
shut down the Generals offensively.
Tate tossed a complete game and surren-
dered only seven hits to the potent W&L
lineup.

First-year catcher Luke Deary and
senior ﬁrst baseman Hunter Serenbetz
each knocked in a run off Tate, but the
Generals couldn’t set up an extended
rally. As soon as the ﬁnal out was made
in the top of the ninth, it was clear this
was a contest the Generals would rather
forget.

Two days later, the team looked to
rebound with a home match-up against

The Washington and Lee women’s
lacrosse team improved to 4-2 with a 21-
1 Victory over Sweet Briar College and
a 16-10 win over No. 16 Mary Washing-
ton.

The Generals traveled to Sweet Briar
College on Tuesday, coming off a 16-8
loss versus Franklin and Marshall. But
the Generals showed no signs of weak-
ness against Sweet Briar. Nine different
W&L players scored in the ﬁrst half en
route to a crushing 21-1 victory.

Senior attack Britten Mathews and
junior midﬁelder Emmy Mathews set
the tone for the rest of the game by scor-
ing back-to-back goals before even ﬁve
minutes of playing time had passed.

Sweet Briar followed with a goal of
its own, but it was the only net action
the team would see for the remainder of
the contest.

Sophomore goalie Jen Linder played
30 minutes in goal, putting up one save
versus one allowed goal. F irst-year goal-
ie Alex Hamill ﬁlled in for the other 30
minutes and did not face one shot.

Emmy Mathews scored three goals
to lead the Generals. Seven Generals
earned added two individual goals for
W&L: senior attack Meredith Free-
man, sophomore midﬁelder Christina
Benedetti, sophomore midﬁelder Alexis
Harrison, ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Ashley
Barnes, sophomore attack Alli Shea-
rin, ﬁrst-year attack Elizabeth Buck-
lee and ﬁrst-year attack Mary Jennings
VanSant.

Britten Mathews, junior midﬁelder

Kate Donnelly, sophomore attack Mad-
die McKaig and junior attack Ellie Van
Sant each scored one goal.

On Saturday, the Generals faced No.
17 Mary Washington and came out on
top with a decisive 16-10 victory. The
Generals were led by Emmy Mathews
again, who recorded four goals and two
assists.

Junior attack Wilton Megargel put up
three goals and two assists in the victory,
earning all ofher goals in a crucial pull-
away for the Generals.

The game was close with the Gener-
als leading 9-8 with about 22 minutes
remaining. Megargel scored three of the
subsequent six unanswered goals, which
led to the Generals’ victory. Mathews
added two goals during the 6-0 run.

Junior goalie Katharine F arrar played
the entire game for the Generals, record-
ing 11 saves versus 10 allowed goals.

“It was an exciting win and we
showed exactly what our team can do
when faced with a challenge,” Bene-
detti said. “We came out on top, and I’m
excited to see what else we can accom-
plish.”

The Generals play No. 15 Cortland
State at home at 4:30 p.m. this Wednes-
day.

ﬂipped in this one as W&L raced to a
quick 6-0 lead over the ﬁrst two innings
and eventually ran the ﬁnal score to ll-
4.

RBI singles by ﬁrst-year catcher Will
Salley and Serenbetz, in addition to a
two-run double by senior third baseman
Jim Plantholdt, sparked the ﬁrst inning
outburst. Michael Manfro had been
pitching very well for the Pride this
year, but the Generals were all over ev-
erything he hurled toward home plate.

Senior catcher Will Lewis was given
the day off behind the plate, but still
went 3-4 with two doubles, two runs,
and two RBl’s in the designated hitter
slot. Plantholdt ﬁnished with two hits
and three RBIs.

Senior second baseman John Ditore,
recently crowned ODAC player of the

week, bumped his sparkling average
to .487 with three more hits. He is the
team leader in hits, runs, doubles, aver-
age, slugging percentage, and any other
positive hitting statistic one could think
of. His walk-up song is “S on my chest”
and this is an apt description of his Su-
perman-esque start to the season.

Sophomore pitcher Jody Davis start-
ed and picked up the win for W&L. He
went six innings, scattered ﬁve hits and
struck out three.

Coaches love to see pitchers attack
the strike zone, and Davis did just that.
He worked the comers and set up his
off-speed pitches to perfection, result-
ing in many poor swings for Greens-
boro batters. Over Davis’s six innings
of work, he faced very little stress; GC
would simply pop up or roll over pitches

and kill any potential rally.

W&L has the opportunity to climb
their way back to the top of the ODAC
with a busy week ahead of them. Start-
ing on Wednesday against Stevenson
University,'the team plays seven games
in eight days. This includes two double-
headers against ODAC rivals Guilford
College and Emory & Henry College.
The game on March 17 is at home, with
the ﬁrst pitch scheduled for 3 p.m.

Lax drops first loss

W&L is now 6-1 overall after victory over Ohio Wesleyan and loss to F &M

The Washington and Lee lacrosse team
burned Ohio Wesleyan 9-5 on Tuesday
but couldn’t keep the ﬁre going, falling to
Franklin and Marshall 7-5 on Saturday in
their ﬁrst loss ofthe season. The Generals
are now 6-1.

fused to be stopped in his drive across the
midﬁeld line and gave the Generals some
strong offensive possessions.

At the beginning of the third quarter,
OWU came within one goal of tying the
Generals after attackman Rob Young

First-year midfielder Cooper Brown looks downfield into the

Washington College defense.

A crowd of 320 fans came to see the
No. 8 Generals outscore No. 15 Ohio
Wesleyan 9-5 under the lights at Wilson
Field last Tuesday.

The Generals were led by senior at-
tackman Will Keigler, who notched one
goal and four assists, andjunior midﬁelder
Drew Koeneman, who netted four goals.

Sophomore attackman Scott Meehan
added one goal and one assist while ﬁrst-
year attack Mac Means put up two goals.
Senior midﬁelder Max Mancuso also con-
tributed one goal.

Koeneman scored twice within the first
ﬁve minuets to give the Generals a 2-0
lead over OWU.

The Battling Bishops responded with
some transition goals from broken plays,
but by the end of the first halfthe Gener-
als held a 4-2 lead over OWU. At the half
the Generals had outshot OWU 22-14 and
had shown great poise on defense.

First-year defender Joe LaSala had
two groundballs and caused three turn-
overs. LaSala plays big and physical, and
is one ofmany ﬁrst-year players who have
already made a great impact on the pro-
gram.

Senior captain Tyler Smith also an-
chored down the defense with three
groundballs and two forced turnovers.
While senior goalie Matt Mason had only
ﬁve saves, they were ﬁve saves that really
counted.

Each save came at a critical time when
OWU was trying to climb out from behind
the Generals. Mason made some enor-
mous one-on-one saves on the doorstep of
the goal, and refused the Battling Bishops
any easy goals.

In his ﬁrst year as starting goalie, Ma-
son has stepped up to the plate and shown
great heart, skill, consistency and poise as
a leader on this team.

Also worth noting is ﬁrst-year transi-
tional midﬁelder Cooper Brown, who re-

als didn’t let themselves be ﬂustered and
they knocked off their first ranked team of
the 2010 campaign.

The Generals returned to play on Sat-
urday at Franklin and Marshall. The Gen-
erals hung with the Diplomats, but they
simply couldn’t overcome three early
F&M goals.

W&L didn’t score until the 8:40 mark
in the first period when senior midﬁelder
Kevin Feeriey netted the Generals ﬁrst
goal. That was the only scoring the Gener-
als would see in the second half. The Dip-
lomats lead 4-l heading into the locker
room.

The Generals tried to rally in the sec-
ond halfwith goals from senior midﬁeld-
er Logan Bartlett, Mancuso, Brown and
Means. But it just wasn’t enough to knock
off the Diplomats.

Mason recorded eight saves to counter
his seven goals allowed in the loss.

The Generals will next take on Virgin-
ia Wesleyan University at home on Satur-
day. Game time is set for 1 p.m.

posted an unassisted goal. The goal set
the score at 4-3. This would be the closest
the Battling Bishops would come to tying
the Generals. After a pair of unanswered
goals, W&L took a 6-3 lead.

At the end of 60 minutes of play, three
more goals gave the Generals a 9-5 vic-
tory. W&L outshot OWU 38-27 and capi-
talized offthe numerous ()WU penalties.
