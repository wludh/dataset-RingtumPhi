Redeﬁning
Republicans

Meghan McCain reaches
out to young conservatives

By Eric Gehman
STAFF WRITER

The phrase “Progressive Republican” is not used
often in American politics, but speaker Meghan Mc-
Cain described herself as just that during her presen-
tation last Thursday night in Stackhouse theater.

Speaking on the subject of civility in politics,
McCain discussed the fever pitch of rhetoric in the
media, noting that “incivility is everywhere we turn”
in politics. She decried hyperpartisan talk show hosts
like Glenn Beck and Keith Olbermann for inciting
their audiences to unnecessarily violent outrage.

After her speech concluded, McCain ﬁelded
questions from the audience on her political beliefs,
her work as a blogger at The Daily Beast, and the
future of the Republican party in the wake of sweep-
ing defeat in the 2008 election.

McCain was ardent about the need for conserva-
tives to be more tolerant and accepting of minority
groups like Latinos, African Americans, and Gays.
She expressed a fundamental concern with many
conservatives’ insularity and unwillingness to wel-

come people into the party who have differing views

on issues like gay rights.

As a ‘progressive’ Republican, McCain explained
that she believes out-of-control federal spending to
be the biggest issue facing our generation, but she

“I ’m not saying let is abandon
the core ideas that the Republi-
can party was built on. [Republi-

)

cans] must evolve, or we die. ’

MEGHAN McCAlN, speaker

also supports more liberal ideas like protecting the
environment and supporting gay marriage. As part
of the overarching theme of expanding the conserva-
tive base to encompass more moderate Republicans,
she described herself as a “gun-toting, Jesus-loving
Republican who lives in the West Village” before
asking, “Does that make me a real American, or a
real Republican?”

Ultimately, McCain advocated for moderate Re-

publicans and party minorities to speak out against '

the exclusive, far-right wing of the Republican party
so that other young conservatives will be encour-
aged to involve themselves in the democratic pro-
cess. Citing the energetic youth movement behind
the Obama campaign in 2008, she said that young
Republicans should encourage more pluralism in the
party and keep working to galvanize voters with is-
sues like spending, healthcare reform, and job cre-
ation. '

“I’m not saying let’s abandon the core ideas that
the Republican party was built on,” said McCain.
But she was quick'to add that Republicans “must
evolve, or we die.”

She also discussed the ‘Tea Party’ populism that
has captivated conservative media outlets like Fox
News. McCain said that the Tea Parties are “goodin
theory” because they claim to be protesting federal
spending, but that they “always come down to race.”
She also noted the hypocrisy of their anti-spending
position while they pay speakers like Sarah Palin
hundreds of thousands of dollars in appearance
fees.

McCain also spoke on the subject of new media
and online journalism. As an avid user of Twitter,
Facebook and other social media outlets, she feels
that print journalism is a “dinosaur,” and that politi-
cians will have to adapt to new technologies that help
them reach out to voters. She was widely praised
for her blog that she maintained during her father’s
2008 campaign, but also drew criticism for her more
moderate opinions from right-wing talk radio hosts,
especially a much-publicized ﬂap with conservative
radio host Laura Ingraham.

McCain pointed to Ingraham’s remarks (in which
she called McCain “plus-sized” and a “Valley girl”)
as indicative of the “amped-up”political discourse
and media culture she ﬁnds so troubling.

Kappa Sig to rush
  back to campus

Next fall, the fraternity will recolonize at Washington & Lee after a four-year suspension

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

The Mu chapter of Kappa Sigma
fraternity will be returning to the
Washington and Lee campus in the
fall.

The colonization efforts will be-
gin in the fall and take place over
the course of the year, with the re-
cruitment of upperclassmen, and
continue through the spring, when
ﬁrst-year students will be recruited.
At that time, recruitment will have
been completed, and the chapter will
be fully established.

The title of Mu chapter has been
reserved for the W&L chapter, and
after re-colonization the chapter will
continue to be operating under the
same name. However, other aspects
ofthe chapter will be re-formed from
scratch.

After completing recruitment, the
re-founding fathers of Kappa Sigma
will undergo orientation and train-

' ing.‘ The group will then fulﬁll a list

of requirements to become a chapter.
such as writing bylaws and develop-
ing a pledge education program that
consists of learning about chapter
meetings, and fulﬁlling a set num-
ber of hours of community service.
The ten-month period typically al-
lotted for a colony to get its charter
is followed up with a ceremony that
is attended by other chapters in order
to conduct the ceremony of chapter
installation.

“Kappa Sigma historically has
been a very strong chapter on the
campus of W&L from what I un-
derstand and from looking back at
records,” said Clay Coleman, Direc-

tor of Campus Activities and Greek
Life. “One appeal to Kappa Sigma is
you can be a re-founding father. An-
other is that they also really want to
do things right.”

Kappa Sigma at W&L was sus-
pended for four years in 2007 af-
ter an investigation that found the
chapter in violation of that national
organization’s code of conduct, and
continued disregard for University
policy.

“The University did not ﬁnd in
its judicial bodies that Kappa Sigma
should be suspended, but Kappa Sig-
ma nationals took it upon themselves.
The national organization punished
them more so than the University.
Now, the University held them ac-
countable. They had two strikes, so
one more and they were gone,” said
Coleman. _

The four-year suspension was de-
termined by Kappa Sigma's national
headquarters, and is unrelated to the
Interfraternity Council (IFC) or the
University. The IFC is composed of
the president of each fraternity on
campus, and an executive council of
otﬁcers. One of the purposes of the
IFC, according to its constitution, is
to “address dilﬁcult issues, confront
inappropriate behavior, and hold
themselves and others accountable.”

“The IFC continues to hold or-
ganizations accountable for acts of
hazing, speciﬁcally organizations
that have been suspended in the past
for behaviors. The IFC as a judicial
conduct body is holding its peers ac-
countable more so than in the past,”

Coleman said.

In 2007, the Kappa Sigma pledge
class _was initiated into Beta Theta
Pi fraternity, which was, at the time,
returning to campus from its suspen-
sion. ‘

Jason Rodocker, the predeces-
sor to Coleman and current Director
of Elrod University Commons and
Campus Activities, advocated the
University using its own sanctions
so that behavior could be corrected
before they suspended the charter,
according to Coleman.

“The University tried to go to bat
for Kappa Sigma to a certain extent,
but they respected the decision be-
cause the national organization had to
uphold their policies as well,” Cole-
man said. “They [Kappa Sigma] are
welcome back to campus whenever
the national organization of Kappa
Sigma determines they can.”

“We received the blessings ofthe
school,” said Mick Wilson Executive
Director of Kappa Sigma Fraternity.
“They have been extremely coopera-
tive and we lookforward to coming
back.”

Wilson believes that the length of
suspension for the Mu chapter was
an “adequate amount of time for us
to serve our time and our penance.
Now, we come back with an entire-
ly new group of men with a fresh
start.”

Kappa Sigma national headquar-
ters will be helping the chapter take
new measures in chapter operations,
including involvement from national
headquarters located in Charlottes-

ville, and meeting with volunteer
alumni from the surrounding area on
how to manage affairs and to offer
counsel.

“I hope that when Kappa Sigma
comes back, they will have the guid-
ance of their national organization
and they aregoing to be able to
structure things and have a really
structured organization that is going
to be committed to not only W&L’s
core values, but also the national
organization’s,” said Coleman, who
hopes that Kappa Sigma will moti-
vate other Greek organizations to get
more involved in their national orga-
nizations.

While Kappa Sigma is anticipat-
ed to have a successful recruitment
next school year, it will not have the
luxury of receiving new members
from a suspended fraternity, as Beta
Theta Pi did in 2007. The expansion
ofthe IFC with the addition of Kappa
Sigma to 15 fraternities at W&L may
also add to the existing problem in
recruitment numbers. said IFC Presi-
dent Lindsay Crawford.

Even so, Wilson believes that the
history of Kappa Sigma fratemity,
coupled with the appeal of the lead-
ership opportunities involved with
re-colonization, will aid in the suc-
cessful recruitment of Kappa Sigma.

Wilson hopes that Kappa Sigma is
re-colonized “in such a fashion that
it brings pride to our fraternity on the
national level, brings pride to W&L,
and brings pride to themselves and to
their families.”

Famous alum tells her story

Stacy Morrison, former editor of Redbook and recent book author returns to W&L

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

“Life sends you what it does and
when it does, sometimes you have to
say yes. Most of the time, you have
to say yes. I don’t think I have ever
said no,” said Stacy Morrison, a

' Washington and Lee alum, who was

the editor of Redbook magazine un-
til recently. Morrison was on campus
this past weekend for her reunion.

Morrison has turned down very
few things in her life and it turn has
accomplished all she ever wanted to,
whilejuggling complicated relation-
ships and a 6-year-old son.

The Jenkintown, Pa. native
graduated from W&L in 1990, and
says that she has always been a hard
worker who operates best under
pressure. Her most recent endeav-
ors include the six-year anniversary
of her position at Redbook and her
memoir on divorce, “Falling Apart
in One Piece: An Optimist’s Journey
Through the Hell of Divorce”, which
hit stores on March 23.

Since she became editor-in-chief
in the summer of 2004, Morrison has
made signiﬁcant progress in remak-
ing the 106-year old magazine that
reaches over 10 million American
women every month. She has made
several moves to modernize the
magazine, regarding its content and
photographs.

“I wanted it to feel more optimis-
tic and relevant, more modern. In
modern 1 don’t mean trying to pick
an outside edge of women who are
having do-it-all lives. I am not try-
ing to help you live your to-do list,
but instead live your to-be list,” says

Morrison.

Although Morrison’s changes
have been focused on not losing
the Redbook readers who have sub-
scribed to the magazine for the past
three decades, she claims she has
not done anything she set out to do
for the magazine. Morrison says
that the ﬁrst part of magazine edit-
ing is the articles and pictures. The
second, which although she ﬁnds the
most interesting, Morrison has yet
to fulﬁll at Redbook, involves target
marketing, positioning a brand, and
seeking new customers.

Prior to becoming the editor-in-

chief at Redbook, Morrison served
as the executive editor at Marie
Claire magazine. Although she was
let go from the magazine, Morrison
says it was time for her to move on,
and she landed the job at Redbook
just six weeks later. However, quick
transitioning was not always the case
for Morrison. ‘
When Morrison graduated from
W&L as a member of the second
class of female students, it took her
three months to ﬁnd a job in New
York. She ﬁnally did, using her con-
tacts from a previous internship at
Mademoiselle. During her time at
W&L, Morrison earned a prestigious
internship, through the American So-
ciety of Magazine Editors. Although
she claimed to cry at her desk a lot
while working for “real live” editors,
her summer in New York led her to
Chris, her ex-husband. “I thought he
was pretty cute and we started a rela-
tionship when I moved to New York

after graduation,” says Morrison.
Dreaming of becoming a maga-
zine editor at the age of seven or
eight, Morrison’s favorite magazine
had always been Mirabella, a wom-
en’s magazine that eventually folded

' in 2000. When Morrison landed a

job at Mirabella after graduation,
she considered it a “piece of luck.”
However, she also says that it was
chance that she was falling in love
with Chris when her career was just
taking off. “I didn’t want to get mar-
ried!” said Morrison.

Morrison’s marriage did not last,
and the divorce turned her life in the
opposite direction. However, her re-
lationship with Chris has been noth-
ing more than friendly, she said, and
the two still care about each other.
Nonetheless, Morrison remained
optimistic through the divorce. “I
thought, how can I make this experi-
ence that I didn’t really want, as easy
as possible?” said Morrison.

This is the basis for Morrison’s
memoir that she describes as a road-
map to resilience. It tells readers how
to cope with divorce and how to use
it as an opportunity to reshape their
life and identity after divorce. This is
different from common thoughts that
are associated with divorce about an-
ger and betrayal.

Morrison said she was also in-
spired to write her memoir because
for a long time now she has been
considered ‘a “relationship and sex
expert.” Her goals have always been
to help American women, “I care
really deeply about people amazing

themselves,” says Morrison. This is
seen throughout her memoir.

The W&Lalumjuggled a lot while
writing her memoir, including ﬁnal-
izing her divorce, managing one of
America’s most popular magazines,
and her six-year old son. Fortunately,
Morrison’s time at W&L helped her
master the art ofmultitasking.

At W&L, Morrison created her
own major which was a mix of
courses in French, business, English
and journalism. She was also co-edi-
tor of the yearbook and worked in
the dining hall.

She claims that she lived it all
at W&L and wouldn’t change one
thing about her experience at the col-
lege. Morrison encouraged students
to take advantage of the great pro-
fessors at W&L. She only took one
class with one of her favorite profes-
sors, but she liked him because his
door was always open. “I always tell
my parents that W&L was worth way
more than they ever paid in tuition,”
laughs Morrison.

So what’s next for the success-
ful alum? She doesn’t know. There
has been talk of Morrison turn-
ing her memoir into a TV show or
movie, but people have already been
requesting another book from her.
“For me, I’m really interested to see
what next, something that I couldn’t
have imagined. I am interested to see
what I haven’t dreamed of that I’ll
do,” she said. More importantly, will
Morrison ever say no to something?

The GOP must choose an identity

: Lincoln or Know-Nothing

Arizona is new, possibly racist legislations puts Republicans at a crossroads that could determine November is elections

By Abel Delgado
co LU M N I ST

Just as the Republican Party
appears to be reforming itself,
with energized activists taking a
stand against the statist policies
oftheir political rivals, GOP leg-
islators in Arizona decided shoot
the party in the foot.

Arizona’s recently passed
immigration legislation, called
SBl070, is inherently un-Ameri-
can, clearly unconstitutional and
downright intolerable to the mil-
lions of Hispanics and other US
citizens whose civil rights are
now legally disregarded.

Now it is time for Republi-
cans to decide whether they are
still the party of Lincoln or want
to warp into the party of Know-
Nothings. -

Remember the Know-Noth
ings? They were the “nativist”
crusaders who wanted to do
away with Irish and German im-
migrants.

Lincoln worried? that if the
Know-Nothings ever came to
power, the Declaration of Inde-

pendence would be read to say
“all men are created equal except
negroes, foreigners and Catho-
lics.”

It is a tragic irony that some
of the descendants of the once-
antagonized Irish and German
communities are now antagoniz-
ing other immigrant communi-
ties.

When a known bigot like Tom
Tancredo says he is concerned
the law will allow for racial pro-
ﬁling, you know it went too far.

What happened to the New
Colossus, the Mother of Exiles?

What happened to being the
land of the free and of equal
opportunity, a land built on the
backs of immigrants?

Proponents of the law say it
is not anti-immigrant, but anti-il-
legal immigration and a response
to all the violence taking place
on the border. But this law will
not help.

If we want to stop illegal im-
migration we must secure the

border with a well-funded and
properly trained National Guard.

We must also stop the illegal
gun trade from the US to Mexico
that is providing the weaponry
for the drug wars.

pend on_ inhumane smugglers to
give credence to Lady Liberty’s
promise.

Let us not kid ourselves: if we
want our economy to keep grow-
ing and our entitlement programs

Let us not kid ourselves; if we want our

economy to keep growing and our entitle-

ment programs to stay solvent, we need

[immigrants] as much as they need us.

We must streamline the mess
we call a legal immigration sys-
tem, so that the countless of
honest, hard-working, freedom-
seeking individuals who will
do anything for the well-being
of their families do not have to
break the law to have a chance
at the American Dream and de-

to stay solvent, we need them as
much as they need us.

This law also gives every
tan-skinned, Spanish-speaking
American citizen a cause for
concern and any believer in the
Constitution a cause for disgust.
Article 1, Section 8 of the Con-
stitution states that the US Con-

gress has the power to “establish
an uniform Rule of Naturaliza-
tion.” If Arizona police have the
obligation to determine the legal
status of anybody who causes
“reasonable suspicion” but po-
lice in other states do not have
the power, how is that uniform?

There’s also the fact that
American citizens can cause
“reasonable suspicion” just by
walking down the street and be
arrested for not carrying ID.

If Juan Rodriguez has to carry
ID on him at all times but John
Roberts does not, then this vio-
lates the equal protection clause
of the 14th Amendment.

It disturbs me that some of
those who rightfully worry about
the un-constitutional nature of
an individual mandate for health
care turn a blind eye to the un-
constitutional nature of SBlO70.
Should we only follow the Con-
stitution when we see ﬁt?

It befuddles the mind that
some of the GOP old guard still

think using hate and fear is the
best way to win elections. This is
what defeated the party in 2006
and 2008. '

If Republicans win in 2010, it
will be because of reformers like
Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio, not
hate-mongers like the Arizona
legislatures.

Every great Republican lead-
er, from Lincoln to Regan, was a
reformer who valued the Ameri-
can Dream.

Now it is time for Repub-
Iicans to prove they still know
something about what that dream
means.

Bringing Muhammad to South Park not the smartest move

Tim McAleenan explains both sides of the controversy of showing Muhammad is image on a recent ‘South Park’

By Tim McA|eenan
C0 LUM N I ST

Matt Stone and Trey Parker,
“ the creators of Comedy Central’s
South Park cartoon series, re-
cently stirred up‘ a controversy
with their two-part series last
week depicting the Muslim
prophet Muhammad in an unﬂat-
tering light.

Theirjoke wasn’t all that fun-
ny: it involved a man in a bear
costume standing before a large
audience, when, all ofa sudden...
(drum roll please)... the bear cos-
tume came offto reveal Muham-
mad. By South Park standards,
this does not even come close
to being offensive, especially
when compared to their regular
depiction of gays, minorities,
“gingers,” priests in the Catho-
lic Church, Moses, Jesus, Jews,
Buddha or the pope.

You would think more peo-
ple would be bothered by the
fact that the only black kid in
the class is named “Token,” but
yet, our friends at the New York
Times have yet to write even a
single article about South Park’s
treatment of black characters,
gingers, or Jesus speciﬁcally
(that is, until this past week), but
yet, they have 7,320 articles on
the South Park/Muhammad con-
troversy (counting NY Ti1nes-af-
filiated blogs).

Comedy Central decided to‘

censor the two-part series when
Stone and Parker began receiv-
ing death threats shortly after the

episodes aired. Abu Talhah Al-
Amrikee, who by no means ﬁts
the W&L deﬁnition of a “hang-
out guy,” blasted Stone and Park-
er on his website revolutionmus-
lim.com, which, as you might be
surprised to learn, is not exactly
a website dedicated to Gandhi’s
peaceful-protesting style.
Al-Amrikee pointed out that
the Qur’An clearly and forcibly
forbids the depiction of Muham-

and Dutch Muslim extremists)
shot him eight—EIGHT!—times
and then stuck two knives in Van
Gogh’s torso, along with a ﬁve-
page note explaining why he was
killed. Bouyeri then tried to roll
Van Gogh’s bo'dy down the street
at around 3 AM—a starry night,
indeed.

And what did Van Gogh do to
provoke this? He ﬁlmed a docu-
mentary titled “Submission” that

As a word of advice, I would try and reﬂain

from making any statement that would make

you feel the need to ﬁnish withithe line ‘this is

not a threat. ’Its right up there with beginning

a statement by saying, ‘No offense, but... ’

mad, and he had this to say, “It’s
outright insulting... We have to
‘warn Matt and Trey that what
they are doing is stupid, and they
will probably wind up like Theo
van Gogh for airing this show.
This is not a threat.”
Al-Amrikee was alluding to
the 2004 death ofTheo van Gogh,
who lost more than an car when
Mohammed Bouyeri ofthe Hofs-
tad terrorist group (North African

suggested that the generic “Mus-
lim culture” is not exactly known
for treating its women like prin-
cesses. But I guess we shouldn’t
be too concerned about what
Al-Amrikee had to say, since
he added the line “this is not a
threat” at the end. '

As a word of advice, I would
try and refrain from making any
statement that would make you
feel the need to ﬁnish with the

line “this is not a threat.” It’s
right up there with beginning
a statement by saying, “No of-
fense, but. . .”

And Amrikee points out that
the Qur’An ﬂat-out rejects any
notion of humor regarding re-
ligion. That’s true enough+we
don’t typically confuse Qur’An
passages with punchlines from
Saturday Night Live.

He cites Surah 6, Verse 70 of
the Qur’An which tells believers
to “avoid those who take their re-
ligion as playing and an amuse-
ment and ‘are seduced by the life
of this world... for them a drink
of boiling water, a stern punish-
ment for their disbelief.” Well,
that’s a nice image.

At this point, I think Am-
rikee is just giving Stone and
Parker more ammo for their next
episode. They’Il probably show
Cartman being forced to consume
boiling water, and he’ll end up
putting eggs in his mouth while
the other kids try to paint them
into Easter eggs. I don’t know,
but I am sure we can expect both
Parker and Stone to caricature
those in the Muslim community
and at the New York Times who
have reacted so strongly to their
recent episodes.

But to be fair to the Muslims,
they do have some legitimate
grievances. Much like the ﬁrst-
ﬂoor printer that the “green”
people have apparently taken

over, there are two sides to this
story. .

A lot of Muslims have been
making the argument that just
because you have the right to be
offensive, it doesn’t mean you
should. If you understand that
Muslims do not appreciate de-
pictions of Muhammad, why in-
sist on insulting them? It doesn’t
seem like gentlemanly behav-
ior, they would certainly argue.
I doubt any of us could picture
Robert E. Lee telling “So Mu-
hammad and ﬁfty virgins walked
into a bar” jokes.

Muslim leaders have pointed
out that Americans don’t go
around burning American ﬂags
in front of WWII veterans, uri-
nating on Cruciﬁxes in front of
priests or telling Holocaust jokes
in front of Jews.

So why do this to the Muslim
community? First of all, I don’t
think the South Park/Muhammad
controversy is even in the same
universe as the other three ex-
amples—let’s keep in mind that
it was only Muhammad wearing
a bear suit, and television broad-
casts certainly don’t have the
personal element that the other
three examples contain.

Plus, Americans generally
don’t appreciate fear and in-
timidation tactics. The reason
people don’t burn ﬂags, urinate
on the cross or tell Holocaust
jokes is out of respect or rever-

Whether or not to pitch the Spring Term Option

Is it responsible to take four weeks 0]?’ of school and work if you don ’t have to take a class? Stockton Bullitt thinks so

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

When I ﬁrst heard about the
Spring Term Option, I thought of
my mom.

See, when I was a little kid,
I had a similar work ethic to the
one I have in college. That is, I
did as little as possible for me to
not get into trouble. ‘

My mom, whose hard-work-
ing genes did not pass onto me,
would occasionally explain, “I ‘m
working x number of hours a
week just so you can sit at home
and play video games? C’mon!”
Around that time, I would usu-

». ally scurry to my backpack and
‘diligently try to look like I was ‘

hard at work.

Anyway, this vision kept re-
playing in my head whenever I
would talk to seniors taking their
Spring Option. I couldn’t see
how their parents weren’t berat-
ing them with phone calls yell-
ing, “I’m paying $50,000 a year
for you to do nothing?!”

For those who don’t know,
Spring Term Option is a way
to avoid taking classes during

Spring Term without getting into
trouble.

Now, I know that Spring Term
Option is primarily used for stu-
dents who want to start their in-
ternships a little early. Let’s just
forget about those students. They
are the malicious overachievers

taking their Spring Temi Option
are all obviously ﬁnished with
their graduation requirements
and therefore do not need to take
a class they don’t want to take.

’ I also know that Spring Term
Option has been around for a
while, but with spring term’s

that they could not imagine hav-
ing to sit through. I don’t have
the statistics to back this up,
but it seems like there are many
more seniors opting for a spring
term full of relaxed tanning than
before.

Although I didn’t have a real

This vision kept replaying in my head whenever I would talk

to seniors taking their Spring Option. I couldn ’t see how their

who make us all look worse by
comparison. Plus, they are now
much too busy and important to

read the Ring-tum Phi so I’ll take I

all the cheap shots, I want thank
you very much. _
I also know that all the seniors

change from six weeks to four,
chaos has ensued.

Many students could not get
into the class they wanted, which
caused many seniors to just shrug
and take the last four weeks off
instead of sitting through a class

problem with it, I really couldn’t
see how so many students could
simply get away with an extra
four-week vacation. I kept look-
ing at the situation as a failure
on the registrar’s fault: they let
down the students by not creat-

ing enough interesting classes for
the four-week spring term.

This is why I was so willing '

to take all the cheap shots I could
at the registrar in the last issue.

I was ﬁrm in my opinion un-
til alumni weekend. Whenever
I would get into a conversation
with an alum over the weekend,
all of them had the same piece of
general advice: “Appreciate this
while you can.” .

When they would roam around
the dorms, houses or classrooms,
the alumni only seemed to re-
member a couple of detail-s: a
dumb, adventurous action taken
by themselves or a friend, how
the scenery has changed since
graduation and only a few special
classes taken while at school.

I know that these memories
do not seem especially impor-
tant, but they did help me switch
my opinion on Spring Term Op-
tion. With only four weeks of
school left before graduation, the
seniors taking their Spring Term
Option are maximizing the num-

ence — they cherish the symbol
of America and Jesus Christ, and
they feel empathy with the hor-
rors of WWII, so why would
anyone go around debasing ob-
jects or symbols they respect?

But the American culture, as
a whole, does not respect cer-
tain tenets of Islam. And the no-
tion that we should refrain from
criticism out of fear of retaliation
from Muslim extremists cannot
be put on the same level with
why we refrain from foully de-
picting the American ﬂag, Jesus,
or the Holocaust.

For the time being, I think
we should focus on Parker and
Stone’s safety. Obviously, out
there in California, they don’t
have room in their Enron-like
budgets to give Parker and Stone
the protection they need.

Therefore, I’m hoping Presi-
dent Ruscio will extend an invi-
tation for them to come to Lex-
ington and shoot the next couple
of seasons here, just to be on the
safe side.

After all, with our two cop-
cars to one student ratio, there
could hardly be a safer place in
the country for them to go.

And if .the local cops had to
worry about Muslim extrem-
ists raining down on our parade,
maybe they’d be less concerned
about nailing that freshman who
blew——GASP!— a .03.

ber of important memories they
can gather.

Instead of wasting a couple of
hours sitting through a class that
they won’t remember ﬁve min-
utes after taking the ﬁnal, they are
completing their last requirement
by spending four weeks making
sure that all the dumb adventures
they can have while in Lexington
are properly accomplished be-
fore graduation.

With that in mind, maybe the
Spring Term Option has a point.
Maybe my mom would approve
of taking four weeks to stretch
out before entering the game of

I real life. And maybe the registrar

knows more than I thought they
did. Well, maybe.

Declaring independence from tyranny

An inherently corrupt system, the new Spring Term needs to be reviewed

By Katherine Roberts
C O PY E D I T O R

When in the course of human
events it becomes necessary for
one student body to dissolve the
academic bands which have con-
nected them with a newly revised
term in the school year and to
assume among the powers of the
earth, the separate and equal sta-
tion to which the Laws of Nature
and of Nature’s God entitle them,
a decent respect to the opinions of
mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel
them to the separation.

Below are excerpts from the
Declaration for a return to Old
Spring Term, which we found ly-
ing around in the Commons.

Side note: is there a spring
term class on re—creating the
Revolutionary War?

We hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all students
are created equal, that they are
endowed by Robert E. Lee with
certain‘ unalienable Rights, that
among these are Life, Liberty and
the pursuit of Happiness. ..

The history of the present
Spring Term is a history of re-
peated injuries and usurpations,
all having in direct object the

establishment of an absolute
Tyranny over these students. To
prove this, let Facts be submitted
to a candid world.

It has called together student
bodies at times unusual, uncom-
fortable, and distant from the de-

Not Sit At Home Alone; refusing
to pass others to encourage their
migrations hither, and raising the

It has erected a multitude of
Hard Classes, and sent hither
swarms of work to harass our peo-
ple and eat out their substance.

It has combined with others to
subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign
to our Constitution, and unac-
knowledged by our laws; giving
its assent to its acts of pretended
legislation...

It has plundered our seas,

ravaged our coasts, burnt our
towns and destroyed the lives of
our people.

It is at this time transporting
large armies of foreign merce-
naries to complete the works of
death, desolation and tyranny,
already begun with circumstances-
of Cruelty & Perﬁdy scarcely
paralleled in the most barbarous
ages, and totally unworthy the
head ofa civilized university.

It has constrained our Fellow
Students taken captive on the
High Seas to go abroad instead
of being here.

It has excited domestic insur-
rections amongst us, and has en-
deavoured to bring on the inhabit-
ants of our frontiers, the merciless
Indian Savages whose known rule
of warfare, is an undistinguished
destruction of all ages, sexes and
conditions.

In every stage of these Op-
pressions we have petitioned for
redress in the most humble’term_s:
Our repeated petitions have been
answered only by" repeated injury.
A Term, whose character is thus
marked by every act which may
deﬁne a Tyrant, is unﬁt to be the
ruler of a free student body.

Hell in Lexington: slow Internet

Video streaming and Internet speed has slowed down in recent months

By Dane Davis
COLUMNIST

At ﬁrst I thought it was me.
Well, my computer to be exact.
During ﬁnals week, the Internet
on campus slowed to a halt.

My e-mail was down peri-
odically and sometimes websites
would refuse to load. Perhaps, I
thought, my computer was out of
date. Yet when I returned home,
I was shocked to ﬁnd that the
problem lied not with my com-
puter, but with Washington and
Lee’s Internet network. Simple,
short Youtube videos which took
minutes to load here in Lexington
loaded in mere seconds on my
Internet connection at home. For
someone who lives in Ohio, it is
quite depressing that my Internet

connection in the dour Midwest
was superior to that of an elite
and expensive private school.

Upon returning to campus
for spring term, I found that the
Internet problems persist. Video,
streaming or otherwise, is chop-
py and slow. When I attempted
to watch a baseball game, I could
watch the game faster over my
phone than on my computer.

Let us be frank. The Internet
services at W&L are subpar for
the price we pay as students.
Compared to other college cam-
puses, W&L has an inferior Inter-
net network. The thing is, I don’t
remember it being this slow and
intermittent a few short years

ago. With the rise of video web
applications, bandwidth is ever
more necessary to the smooth use
of the Intemet’s full potential.

Within the pages of this
newspaper, others have already
brought to the attention of In-
formation Technology Services
inadequacies in various areas of
student computing. The Internet,
as the backbone of student com-
puting, should receive priority in
upgrades and attention.

Unless action is taken now,
this problem is going to get
worse. Youtube and Hulu are not
going away anytime soon. W&L
should invest in the necessary

In addition, a comprehen-

Internet on campus should be
completed, published, and pub-

already exists, then it should be

As it stands now, the univer-

standards our students rightfully
expect. With the right attention
and involvement by the com-
munity, we can all rectify this
problem.

CSS recognizes campus leadership

Celebrating Student Success Committee picks students each month to honor for campus contributions, achievements

By Findley Merrit
smrr wamzn

Celebrating Student Success
honors two students this month
for their contributions to the
Washington and Lee community.

Senior Neville Fogarty and
Junior Cristina Bratu received
this award for May, and will be
honored at a reception in the
Commons Living room at 2 p.m.
on Wednesday.

Student Coordinator Grace
McGee explained that CSS is an
initiative that seeks to recognize
student achievement and contri-
bution to the W&L community,
especially where it is often over-
looked.

“Neville and Cristina were
selected by the CSS committee
because of the depth and breadth
of their impact to the W&L com-
munity and campus life,” said
McGee.

It is an award given each
month to a male and female stu-

dent who are ﬁrst nominated by
someone in the W&L communi-
ty and then selected by the CSS
committee. Anyone may nomi-
nate any student at any time.

“This is what makes CSS
such a unique award, because
the nominations come directly
from the community of people
whom the recipients impact,”
said McGee.

Fogarty, a double major in
economics and math, founded
The Washingtones, a co-ed a
cappella group on campus. '

He is the section leader for
chamber singers and works with
Music Ministry for Catholic
Campus Ministries.

“lt’s like the Catholic RUF,”
Fogarty explained.

He also teaches Sunday school
at St. Patrick’s Catholic Church,
writes crossword puzzles for the
Ring-Tum Phi and serves as an

Assistant Head Residential Ad-
visor in Gaines.
But out of his laundry list of

for economies and is a member
of four different honor societies
including Phi Beta Kappa.

“What CSS hopes to shed light on are the ways

in which students can enhance our

experience at W&L—that each students

involvement, Fogarty takes pride
most in founding The Wash-
ingtones during his sophomore
yeah
“I put in a lot of me,” he said.
On the academic side, Fogar-
ty received the Gunn Scholarship

“I ean’t list their full names
because I get Greek dyslexia,”
joked Fogarty.

Bratu is also a member of Phi
Beta Kappa and on the Dean’s
List.

The economics major is a

member of ESOL, has a radio
show on WLUR every week,
peer tutors, is involved in the
new microﬁnance group, the
General Development Initiative
and a is member of the German
Club.

She works in the Lenfest
Center box office, and next year
she’ll be the co-chair of the Lit
Campaign program.

But Bratu, hailing from Ro-
mania, is most proud of her sta-
tus as an international student at
Washington and Lee.

“I have managed to get to a
point where I can say, hey, may-
be this is the place for me...I
actually do belong to this strange
place, despite the fact that I’m
from a far-away land that has
nothing to do with this one,” she
said.

Bratu received a Johnson Op-
portunity Grant last summer to

do an internship in Germany, and
she received a Student Summer
Independent Research grant this
year for research in Romania.

She is currently abroad in
Germany.

McGee explained that Bratu
and Fogarty were not selected
solely on their resumes.

“That students like Cristina
and Neville are inﬂuential at
W&L is an understatement,” she
said. “What CSS hopes to shed
light on are the ways in which
students can enhance our expe-
rience at W&L—that each stu-
dent’s success is, in some mea-
sure, our own success, and that is
cause for celebration.”

CSS will host the End-of-Year
Event, where various awards like
the Decade Award and the Un-
sung General Award will be pre-
sented, on May 16 at 7 p.m. in
Stackhouse Theater.

Derby Days games supportcharity

Annual Sigma Chi event supports Children ’s Miracle Network, sororities battle each other for champion is‘ title

By Lizz Dye and
Stephanie Hardiman
STAFF WRITER

ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

Women wearing jerseys with
their respective Greek names are
a sure sign that spring has ﬁnally
arrived and Sigma Chi Derby
Days have begun.

The event’s main goal is to
raise money for Sigma Chi’s
national philathropy, Children’s
Miracle Network.

But in past years, the event,
which takes place at the Pole
houses, has come under ﬁre for
unnecessary roughness in the
powder puff games that have
left women with broken limbs
and teeth. Complaints of favorit-
ism and a lack of visible points
and rules have also plagued the
event.

This year, Washington and
Lee’s Panhellenic Council had a
list of requests it wanted imple-
mented to make the event more
enjoyable and fair for the women
participating.

Panhel requested a visual
scoreboard, a tangible copy of the
schedule and how to earn points,

referees for powder puff football
provided by Campus Recreation
and a $2 per head registration fee
for each person entered, which
would go to charity. '

Sigma Chi President Brian
Keegan and Vice President Greg
Bekiaris said they worked to-
gether this year to enforce these
changes. ’

But some students are still
calling foul on the games.

Hannah Muther, Pi Beta Phi’s
vice president of member devel-
opment, said that it was obvious
that sober campus referees were
not used.

“It’s in the best interest of ev-
eryone in Panhellenic that this is
done fairly and for the primary
motive of serving a charity,” said
Muther.

Many powderpuff players
were scratched or bruised by the
conclusion of the games.

Bekiaris emphasized that the
goal for Derby Days is to shift
the focus from the more social

aspects of the event back to phi-
lanthropy. He says that Derby
Days “is a philanthropic event
with social aspects” and the so-
cial aspects are what make the

as its national charity. The event
hinges upon sorority participa-
tion and is driven by the dedica-

tion of mostly ﬁrst-year sorority

women during the week.

“Its in the best interest of everyone in Pan-
hellenic that this is done fairly and for the

primary motive of serving a charity. ”

Hannah Muther, Pi Beta Phi V.P. Member Development
 

different events more competi-
tive and successful as a whole.

Derby Days is a philanthropic
event hosted by Sigma Chi chap-
ters across the nation, which
originally began in 1933 at the
University of Califomia-Berke-
ley’s Sigma Chi chapter.

In 1992, Sigma Chi selected
the Children’s Miracle Network

The schedule for Derby Days
began on Monday with a tricy-
cle race betweent the sororities’
coaches, a new event this year.
Sigma Chi decided to include a‘
tricycle race this year because
members recognized that they
ask a lot of the women partici-
pating, and they wanted to en-
courage fraternity members to

get involved and contribute to
the event.

Tuesday included relay races
and ﬁeld games, including dizzy
bat, greasy watermelon, tug of
war, egg in spoon races and a
water balloon toss, as well as a
banner competition.

On Wednesday there was a
cook-off at the Sigma Chi house
and food was judged on presen-
tation, taste, drinks and desserts.
Sigma Chi had planned on hav-
ing a concert featuring Mike
Posner at the Pavillion that eve-
ning; however, it was cancelled
in order to donate more money to
the Children’s Miracle Network.

On Thursday powderpulf
games began in which ﬁrst-year

' members of sororities competed

against each other.

Friday was the powderpuff
ﬁnals with teams ranked on their
perfonnance from the day be-
fore. Following the powderpuff
football ﬁnals were skits put on
by the different sororities. Each

event had a corresponding num-
ber of points awarded to the so-
rority that comes in ﬁrst, second,
third and fourth, which were out-
lined in a handout given to each
sorority.

For the sororities that came
in ﬁrst in certain events, such as
the relay races, powderpuff foot-
ball, the banner contest and the
cook—off, $500 was donated to
the Children’s Miracle Network
in their name by the Sigma Chi
Zeta Chapter. A

When the ﬁnal results came
in, Kappa Kappa Gamma came
in ﬁrst, Chi Omega second, Al-
pha Delta Pi third and Pi Beta
Phi fourth.

Smoking tunes for steamy spring

Washington and Lee is only campus radio station handpicks the freshest batch of new music to tickle your earbuds

By WLUR Staff
STAFF WRITER

We return with advice on how
to navigate the endless-stream of
new independent music and find
the very best of the bunch:

Sharon Jones &
The Dap-Kings
I Learned the Hard Way
(Daptone)

Another piece of “Daptone
Gold” from the Brooklyn label,
Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings
give us a beautiful record of spirit
and soul. Fully engrossed in the
classic sounds of Muscle Shoals
and Stax, Jones and her band ﬁnd
a way to make soul sound fresh
and new. “The Game Gets Old”
kicks things off at a moderate
pace before the record speeds up
and slows down in swell propor-
tion. F ans of Aretha and Mavis,
check out the Sam Cooke-style
“Mama Don’t Like My Man”
and the stellar “I Learned the
Hard Way.” A glorious record.

Roky Erickson with
Okkervil River

by the group’s label, ANTI-, also

Sigma Phi Epsilon, it is an event
intended to promote gender rela-
tions on campus.

Keaton Fletcher, a first-year
and Sig Ep chairman of the tour-
nament, said that one of the main
purposes of the games is to foster
“interactions in a safe, sober envi-
ronment” between the sexes.

_ And while there won’t be any
alcohol, pizza and other refresh-
ments will be included with the
entrance fee, which is $15 per 3-
person team.

As an added beneﬁt, multiple
outstanding charities will receive
all money raised for the touma-
ment. V

YouthAids, Sig Ep’s national
charity, First Book, one of Pi
Phi’s national charities and the Pi
Phi Foundation will be receiving
almost all of the funds, helped by
sponsorships from Campus Activ-
ities, Multicultural Students As-
sociation, Gay/Straight Alliance,
l-in-4 and a few local shops.

Brittany Tomkies, Pi Phi’s phi-
lanthropy chair, said that most of
the revenue comes from entrance
fees and T-shirt sales. Shirts are
$15, but cost only $12 for those
entering teams.

Some of the donations will
help offset the costs of prizes for
the 3-point shooting and foul shot
winners, and champions of each
bracket.

Teams can sign up to play in
either a free-style, more of a just-

for-fun bracket, or a competitive ‘

bracket. Both will compete in
a half-court single-elimination
“March Madness” knockout style,
said Tomkies.

In the free-style bracket,
Fletcher said that “outlandish
costumes are highly encouraged,”
and that prizes are given for the
best-dressed group.

Last year’s costume contest
winners included sophomore

Katherine Roberts.

“Team Stegosaurus” was ini-
tially her idea, she said, but team
member Allison Chopin, ajunior,
designed the costumes in a Land
Before Time fashion.

Roberts was Little Foot, Cho-
pin was Chomper, and sophomore
Josh Posner was Spike.

Dressed in decorated T-shirts
with green foam spikes as head-
gear, Team Stegosaurus easily
overshadowed their competition,
which included Team Tasmanian
Devils and Team Jane Fonda.

The actual basketball game
didn’t go quite as well.

“Although we played with en-
thusiasm,” Roberts said, the “high
point” was definitely the one bas-
ket scored by Chopin.

But the games are just as much
a social as an athletic function.

Christina Torres, a junior, com-
peted in the competitive bracket
her freshman year. Her team only
played one game as well.

“You don’t have to be good” in
order to have a good time, Torres
said.

Eating pizza, listening to mu-
sic and catching up with friends
are - all part of the toumament’s
appeal

Torres also said she hopes “to
see people just supporting the
other teams.”

Even some W&L staff are get-
ting involved in the tournament.

The Art Department is planning
on entering a team to compete,
and the Math Department will ei-
ther be competing or sponsoring a
team, according to Tomkies.

The tournament will take place
at l p.m. on Saturday at the Da-
vidson Park basketball court. The
rain location is Doremus Gym at
4:30 p.m.

Entertainment for the ﬁrst half

of the day will be provided by
bands including The Drew Martin
Band, KC and the Joneses, Deli-
cious on Purpose, Rikki Tikki
_Tavi, Michael Morella and Scotty
Groth.

DJ Levitown will mix until the
tournament wraps up.

All those interested in playing
can register this week in the com-
mons from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., and
can swipe it home. Shirts won’t be
ready for pick-up until Thursday.
Teams can register until Friday,
and T-shirts can also be purchased
at the tournament.

In these songs, Erickson address-
es his troubled history in his own

 

words, eschewing the metaphors
of earlier songs like “I Walked
with a Zombie” to speak directly
about hardship and the lessons
learned from it. Will Sheff’s
production highlights the songs
while interweaving them with
found-sound and archival re-
cordings culled from Erickson’s
home videos and recordings
made in the Rusk State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane.

“This is not a cynical come-
back record, a lukewarm update
on an established legacy — these
are the best songs Roky has ever
written, unreleased due to de-
cades of personal problems.”

We wanted to write our own
review of this record, but we
can’t top that one, so we’ll sim-
ply expound on it. This is one
of the best and most significant

releases of 2010. It’s amazing
to think that someone who has
had such a tough life could still
make art this beautiful and mov-
ing. It’s also not what you might
have expected from the “found-
ing father of psychedelic rock;”
True Love Cast Out All Evil is
deﬁnitely a Texas country-rock
record—hence the sensible, ex-
cellent decision to enlist the help
of Sheff and Okkervil River.
Check out “Goodbye Sweet
Dreams,” “Bring Back the Past,”
“Be and Bring Me Home” and
the title track.

MGMT
Congratulations (Columbia)

 

MGMT’s 2008 debut, 0racu-
lar Spectacular, quickly pro-
pelled the band to stardom.
“Kids” and “Electric Feel” had
great crossover appeal, and
“Weekend Wars” and “The
Youth” were pretty solid jams,

too. But without looking, can
you name a single track from the
second half of that LP? Didn’t
think so.

 

For the follow-up, Ben Gold-
wasser and Andrew Van Wyn-
garden have made their ﬁrst re-
ally good album. It’s consistent
from start to ﬁnish, yet it also
may not be what you expect
from MGMT. The band is less
reliant on electro-pop ﬂourishes,
focusing more on psychede-
lia—which, while not neces-
sarily prevalent, was certainly
noticeable throughout Oracular
Spectacular. That’s not to say
there aren’t any danceable num-
bers or catchy singles (go right
to “Flash Delirium” and then to
“Brian Eno”), but when the band
launches into a 12-minute, Pink
Floyd-inspired jam like “Sibe-
rian Breaks,” it makes sense in
the context of the record as a

whole. The band has hit its target
on Congratulations; now, the big
question is if they’ll reel in the
casual fans who swayed along to
“Kids.”

The Tallest Man on Earth
The Wild Hunt (Dead
Oceans)

The Wild Hunt is the sec-
ond album from lovely Swed-
ish folksinger Kristian Mattson,
a.k.a. The Tallest Man on Earth.
Here’s what the promoter has to
say: “The Wild Hunt picks up
where [previous record] Shal-
low Grave left off, with Mattson
doing what he does best. It is
unmistakably The Tallest Man
on Earth, from the,urgent strums
of ‘You’re Going Back’ and the
sweet melodies of ‘Love is All,’
to the playful lyricism of live
favorite ‘King of Spain’ and the
subtle hook on ‘Burden of To-
morrow.’ The Wild Hunt isn’t just
another folk album; this is acous-
tic rock’n’roll from a man with a
story to tell.”

Like a Swedish version of
Deer Tick, The Tallest Man on
Earth belts it out with strangled
vocal chords and seductive sin-
cerity.

W&L defeats rival Randolph-Macon in ﬁrst round of the ODAC tournament

By Henri Hammond-Paul
smrr wnnsre

The fourth-seeded Washington and
Lee men’s lacrosse team opened the
ODAC tournament with a 12-6 win over
conference rival Randolph—Macon.

Senior attackman Will Keigler led
the Generals’ offense with two goals and

one assist. In the process, he recorded
his hundredth career goal and upped his
career scoring total to 211 points (101
G, 110 A), good enough to place sixth
on W&L’s all-time list.

Sophomore midfielder Luke Walter fires a shot over a Randolph-
Macon defender on Wednesday. He notched a goal in the game.

Mac Means, both ﬁrst-years, chipped in
two goals apiece. Junior midﬁelder Mark
Wachtrneister and ﬁrst-year Luke Hein-
son also notched two points each. Scott
Meehan, Luke Walter, Logan Bartlett,
Chris Washington, and Joe LaSala all
had one goal apiece. ,

The Generals (ll-5, 4-3 in the
ODAC) were stuck at a stalemate
with Randolph—Macon (7-8, 3-4 in the
ODAC) deep into the ﬁrst period. The
score remained even at 2-2 despite dom-
inating offensive play that saw W&L
outshoot the Yellow Jackets 26-7 in the
ﬁrst half. But a seven-goal run over the
next three periods ended any doubt of

the outcome, allowing W&L to coast ~

into the next round.

En route to the victory, the Gener-
als controlled every major aspect of the
game,’ outshooting Randolph—Macon
52-14, winning 40 ground balls to the
Yellow Jackets’ 16, taking 14 out of 21
total face-offs and successfully making
15 of 16 clears.

In what has become a staple of its
play this season, W&L’s defense made
the win possible with outstanding and
unforgiving play. The defense forced
Randolph—Macon into 17 turnovers and
allowed just 14 shots throughout the
whole game. Senior goalie Matt Ma-
son made six saves, backing a back line
ranked seventh in the nation in goals al-
lowed per game, with 6.2.

W&L tennis teams fall, 6-3 at CMU

White, Becht are bright spots for the men, while Brzeski and Snyder. lly wins for the women 3 team

By Jayna Johns
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s men’s and
women’s -tennis teams both endured
tough 6-3 losses in Saturday matches at
Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, Pa.

In its ﬁrst match since being crowned
the 2010 ODAC Champions, the No.
25 men’s’ team faced 8th-ranked CMU,
with all victories coming from ﬁrst-year
Hayden White, recipient of ODAC’s
Rookie of the Year award and sopho-
more Jeremy Becht. t

From the doubles portion ofthe com-
petition, White and Becht teamed to de-
feat their opponents 8-4. It was one of
the more decisive matches of the day
for the men. The No. 1-seeded team of

sophomore Jonathan Gaffney and senior
Alex Brooke could not pull out their
match, falling 9-7. The third—seeded
team, Will Hall and Mac Davis, fell 8-6
in another close match.

In the singles competition, W&L re-
ceived victories at the No. 1 and 2 spots.
White came back from a close lst set
and a 2nd set slump to win his match 7-
6, 1-6, 6-2. Becht then pulled out a solid
6-3, 6-3 victory.

Senior Cliff Gaddy took his oppo-
nent to the limit before succumbing in
the third set After dropping his ﬁrst set
to the close score of 7-5, he pulled out a
6-2 win in the second set. The third went

all the way to 8-8 before his opponent
pulled away, winning 10-8. Junior Will
Hall also lost a close ﬁrst set, 7-5, before
falling in the second set 6-2. '

The match concluded the men’s reg-
ular season, as they ﬁnished with a 15-8
overall record. '

The women’s team also won the 2010
ODAC Championship last weekend, its
20th in 25 years of ODAC competition.
It is also the ninth°consecutive title for
W&L.

The women came into the match
ranked sixth in the nation, with CMU
not far behind at No. 10. Similar to the
men’s games, the women recorded one

doubles victory and two singles victo-
ties.

The doubles team of sophomores
Lauren Lukas and Ann Morris fought
their way to a close 9-7 victory while
senior Lauren Caire and sophomore El-
len Yeatman slipped to a 8-3 loss. The‘
sophomore and senior team of Trelsie
Sadler and Blair Brezeski_ also came up
short, losing 9-8 in the closest match of
the day.

But Brezeski found redemption with
a 6-3, 3-0 victory singles victory. Soph-
omore Jen Snyder took W&L’s second
win with a 7-6, 7-6 victory.

The women’s tennis team also ﬁn-

ished their regular season with this
match, ending with an 18-5 record.
Both men’s and women’s teams will
be back in action on May 14, when
they begin playing in the ﬁrst round of

j the NCAA Division III Toumament at

a location to be determined. They each
earned the trip to Nationals through
the automatic bid provided by winning
ODACs. ‘

Odds stacked against QB Tebow

Brones ’newest star must overcome history, position battles to thrive in NFL

By Adam Cancryn
SPORTS EDITOR
The collective jaw of the football-
watching world dropped when the Den-
ver Broncos selected Tim Tebow with
the 25th pick in the NFL Draft.
Projected as a second-round talent at
best, Tebow instead became the second
quarterback taken overall, vaulting over

»a number of higher-rated, NFL-ready

prospects.

One can only speculate about Bron-
cos’ motivations for frantically trading
up to choose player with faulty footwork
and a slow release. Though Tebow’s
college track record and impeccable
off-ﬁeld reputation will sell tickets and
jerseys, his fortunes on the ﬁeld are not
so easily predictable‘.

Tebow has worked furiously to trans-
form himself into a viable NFL invest-
ment. He radically altered his throwing
motion to cut down on his release time
and has taken more snaps from under
center to prove he can master the foot-
work required of a_ professional quarter-
back. At the scouting combine, the Flor-
ida QB ran a record three-cone shuttle
time, convincing many that his uncom-
mon combination of size (6’3” 245 lbs)

‘ and speed (4.7 second 40-yard dash) can

translate at the next level.

Despite this, however, the odds re-
main heavily stacked against Tebow.
His most basic disadvantage is one that
no amount of training can ﬁx: he is left-

handed. Like a lefty shortstop, Tebow
plays the one position in the sport that is
rarely kind to southpaws.

There have been just 36 left-handed
quarterbacks in the NFL’s history. Of
those, ﬁve have had long, successﬁil
careers. Hall-of-Famer Steve Young,
Boomer Esiason, Mark Brunell, Frankie
Albert and Ken Stabler combined to win
three Super Bowls, play in 22 Pro Bowls
and amass a touchdown-to-interception
ratio of 1.26 to 1. Add in Michael Vick,
Scott Mitchell and Jim Zorn, and these
elite eight could hang with any of their
righty counterparts.

But go any further down the line, and
the numbers get ugly. The remaining 28
left-handers have notched just three Pro
Bowl appearances and zero Super Bowl
wins. Sixteen never won a game they
started, and much of the list reads like
a who’s who of draft busts. Todd Ma-
rinovich, Tony Graziani, Chris Simms
and Cade_McNown are just of few of the
more disappointing members.

There are a number of theories as to
why southpaws rarely succeed in the
pros despite fruitful college careers.
The ﬁrst is plain physics: the football
spirals in the opposite direction when
thrown by a lefty as opposed to a right-
hander. This forces receivers to adjust to
the different arc, fade and perspective
of a lefty-thrown ball. In college this

is rarely crucial. But the tight passing
lanes and tiny windows quarterbacks
must force throws into in the pros means
that any slight variation can throw off a
play’s timing.

Having a left-hander at QB also
forces the team to reverse the entire
playbook. Rollouts must move left in-
stead of right, receivers have to adjust

volatile. Both Orton and Quinn are play-
ers in their prime used to battling for
playing time. After an uneven career in
Chicago, Orton was shipped to Denver
last year, where he played well but rare-

I 1y great. Instead of a vote of conﬁdence

in the off-season, coach Josh McDaniels
brought in Quinn and drafted Tebow.
Quinn comes from the Cleveland

The remaining 28 left-handers have notched just

three Pro Bowl appearances and zero Super Bowl

wins.

their routes and the right tackle is now
the all-important blind-side blocker. For
teams who aren’t settled at the position,
there is little chance that a lefty will get
enough quality reps to be comfortable
playing within a reversed playbook.
Unfortunately for Tebow, the Bron-
cos are just such a team. He will enter
camp as part of a three-man position

battle with incumbent Kyle Orton and V

newcomer Brady Quinn. Both are right-
handed.

In addition to the expectations and
status heaped onto a ﬁrst-round draftee,

the quarterback situation is potentially I

Browns, where he waged a positional
battle with Derek Anderson for two
years without ever gaining a sense of
job security.

With Orton and Quinn trying desper-
ately to prove themselves, Tebow will
not beneﬁt from the type of mentor-ap-
prentice situation under which QBs like
Steve Young ﬂourished. Instead, he will
be thrust into the limelight, with every
misstep and incomplete pass mercilessly
dissected. V

Tebow’s obstacles extend beyond his
personal and team situation, including
learning a new pro-style system, mak-

ing do with an underwhelming receiv-
ing corps and breaking the tradition of
Florida QBs as NFL failures.

But if there is one trait Tebow shares
with lefty greats like Young and Esiason,
it is his pretematural leadership skills.
He commanded a college team of future
NFL stars better than Quinn and Orton
ever have in their respective careers,
and has demonstrated a work ethic that
in just a few months turned Tebow from
a ﬁfth-round talent to the 25th overall
selection. I

There is no doubt Tebow is conﬁdent
in his abilities, but it will take the effort
of the entire team to turn its ﬁrst-round
gamble into a long-term success.

W&L women 3 lacrosse defeats Lynchbu-rg, wins 8th tournament title

STAFF wrmsn

A seven—goal run to open play against
Lynchburg catapulted the Washington and
Lee women’s lacrosse team to a 14-6 vic-
tory and eighth ODAC championship Sat-
urday o_n Watt Field.

The top-seeded Generals (13-4, 8-0
in the ODAC) dominated their opponent
early, with four different players notch-
ing goals en route to a 7-0 advantage with
17:25 remaining in the ﬁrst half.

Though Lynchburg would eventually
