VOLUME CXIII, NUMBER 10

STAFF WRITER

300 students’ Winter Break was
postponed when the largest snowstorm
in 100 years hit Lexington. Many
students who were expecting to leave
after their last ﬁnal late in the week
were disappointed upon hearing that
I-81 was completely inaccessible.

The University did not have any

been made to students on campus,
but it was fun.”

Some students were able to walk
to Kroger, which remained open
despite the storm, and used the
kitchens in Gaines residence hall.
Other students’ families were with
them so they went to local restaurants.
F irst—year Zachary Huey was able to
dine at local favorite Southern Inn

“Some of my friends were also snowed in so

we were able to hang out and unwind from

the stress of ﬁnals week. We went sledding

and took pictures. ”

ANNIE ZHANG, ﬂrst-year

plan to deal with a situation as serious
as this unexpected snowstorm. The
dining hall had already shut down for
the break so students who lived on
campus had no access to food.

“I understand that the workers at
D-Hall probably couldn’t get there
either, but there was no food at all,”
said first-year Matthew Coburn.
“More accommodations could have

with his dad and brother.

Dominos pizza was a big favorite
among those remaining on campus.

“The buffalo chicken pizza
is ‘noice,”’ said first-year Alex
Schuyler.

Although there wasn’t food
available for the first few days,
students agree that the University
did a good job of making sure the
sidewalks and roads were clear.

“They kept the roads fairly clean
and had people working hard to keep
the sidewalks usable, every available
shovel was on the job of keeping the
situation livable,” said Huey.

Schuyler felt that the University
did a good job keeping their students
informed about the situation. “They
sent out plenty of e-mails warning us
about the weather.”

Students made the best of their
less than ideal situation. “I built a
giant snowman, took pictures, made
hot chocolate, and watched Christmas
movies,” said Coburn. Huey was able
to build an igloo with his brother.

“Luckily, some of my friends
were also snowed in so we were able
to hang out and unwind from the
stress of ﬁnals’ week,” said Annie
Zhang. “We went sledding and took
pictures.”

The city of Lexington had not
been anticipating the severity of such
a large blizzard heading their way. “I
got stuck in a ditch Friday and I had to
wait for a tow truck that didn’t come
for three hours,” said Schuyler. “I
was supposed to wait by my car for
eight hours the next day for a tow
truck, it was still snowing outside.
Luckily, I found someone to tow my
car quickly.”

Winter fun in the sun...and sand

Taglit-Birthright program sends four W&L students to Israel for winter break, giving them the experience of a lifetime
By Eleanor Kennedy and Levl Throckmorton

STAFF WRITERS

For most Washington and Lee
students, the question “What did
you do over break?” yields a fairly
boring answer.

But for seniors Emily Martin
and Zach Segall and sophomores
Josh Posner and Lev Raslin, the
answer was anything but boring.
These lucky students spent 10
days in Israel over break through
Taglit-Birthright Israel.

The Birthright program is
free for Jewish students. Private
philanthropists, the Israeli gov-
emment and Jewish communities
fund it. In order to participate in
the program, students must ﬁll out
an application, write and essay,
and be interviewed.

According to Segall, the pro-

cess is not particularly demand-
ing but “it does really- almost
entirely- on luck, as spot on most
trips are in pretty high demand.”

While in Israel, the W&L
students travelled with 40 other
students from around the country,
as well as seven Israeli soldiers
in civilian clothes, according to
Posner and Raslin.

Posner said he enjoyed travel-
ling with the Israeli soldiers. “It
was cool to get to know them as
peers rather than soldiers. They
wereour age,” he said.

The students traveled through
almost every part of Israel dur-
ing the trip. They visited some
famous and memorable sights
such as The Golan Heights, the

West Bank, Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv. They also rode camels in
the Negev desert and went to the
Dead Sea.

saw what Segall describes as
“the single most moving tribute
to the holocaust I have ever seen
in my life.”

“My favorite part was bonding with other

Jewish people my age and the Israeli sol-

J

ders. ’

Josh Posneri soghomore

For Segall, one of the most
amazing parts of the trip was
Yad Vashem, the Israeli holocaust
memorial and museum.

While visiting the beautifully
constructed museum, the students

Raslin said the Ein Gedi, a
waterfall oasis in the middle of the
desert, was his favorite site among
the places he visited.

“It is also a sanctuary for vari-
ous animals and was deﬁnitely

a refreshing break from the hot
sun,” he said.

Raslin said the trip was also a
cultural learning experience.

“We were there for the last day
of Chanukah as well as Christmas,
so we felt very honored to spend
the day in Israel and see the
relationships between different
cultures,” he said.

Posner also enjoyed learning
about Israeln from a different
point of view.

“My favorite part was bonding
with other Jewish people my age
and the Israeli soldiers,” he said.
“It was good to get an insider’s
perspective on the country.”

The students said they formed
friendships with the other Jewish

students and the Israelis quickly
and easily during the trip.

“The best part of the experi-
ence for me was coming away
with a new sense of Jewish pride,
as well as the speed with which
we made friends,” said Raslin.

“It’s usually difficult for me to
make friends quickly, and the fact
that everyone was there for the
same reason sort of facilitated the
speed of making new friends.”

W&L Hillel has participated
in the Birthright program for
seven years.

While there were many students remaining on campus, there were
also a fair amount of students stranded at the many regional airports
such as Roanoke and Richmond. .
One such student was ﬁrst-year Steele Burrow. “I slept in the
Richmond airport on Friday night, but managed to get a hotel on
Saturday and Sunday night. I ﬁnally was able to get a ﬂight back on
Monday morning.”
The same situation happened to Melissa Horadam. “I slept on the
ﬂoor in Richmond airport and I woke up and there was a horrible rash
on my face. It was terrible.”
“I watched movies on my laptop and read a book,” said Horadam.
Others ventured out into the cold to play in the snow while it was still
fresh.
These students were able to eat at the restaurants in the airports,
but Burrow reports that he “did manage to ﬁnd a Qdoba near the hotel, .
which was quite a blessing.” (Side note: he does not recommend eating
Applebee’s four times within a weekend.)
Though the situation was not what others were hoping for, students
still did the best with what they had. Most students were able to leave
Lexington Sunday night or Monday morning but then had to tackle the
long lines and chaos at airports.
“Sunday night, I had to travel to Richmond, navigate more ﬂight
cancellations and deal with unplowed interstates,” said Cobum.
By Tuesday, all students were able to make it home to their families
for the holidays. Though they didn’t make I home when expected,
many still had fun during their few extra days on campus. This goes
to show that Washington and Lee students are capable of making the
best out of any situation given to them. ~

Gilbert Arenas: a truly funny observation

Basketball player Gilbert Arenas is facing jail time for taking a practical joke a little too practically

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

While most of you spent your
Winter Break hanging out with
friends, sledding down Lexing-
ton’s hills or making one too
many mistakes on New Year’s
Eve, I spent the break religiously
following ESPN.

Yeah, maybe there were other
things going on in my life, like
friends and family for example,
but none of these people were
nearly as entertaining as the
Washington Wizards’ guard, Gil-
bert Arenas.

For those of you who didn’t
spend their break following this
story, Arenas was recently ac-
cused of bringing guns into his
team’s locker room during prac-
tice in December. Because of this
accusation, he is now suspended
indeﬁnitely by the NBA and has
recently pled guilty to a felony
weapons charge, and the Wizards
franchise might void his $111
million contract.

Most of us, if placed in his
situation, would feel an over-

whelming sense of regret and
personal remorse for getting into
that kind of trouble. Gilbert Are-
nas on the other hand seemed
nonchalant throughout the entire
initial process of getting caught
with the guns.

In fact, David Stern chose to
suspend Arenas only after seeing
a photo of him making fake guns
with his ﬁngers during a pregame
warrn-up. By the way, he chose
to do the “shooter” pose a day
after releasing a statement for-
mally expressing his regret for
what he did.

Predictably, media has been
outraged at Arenas’ bravado
ﬁom beginning to end. They
openly and rightly condemn Are-
nas for bringing guns into a pub-
lic arena, but they go further in
codemnig his actions.

The Wizards are now re-
vamping their entire marketing
campaign around the apparently
heinous issue and have profusely
apologized to fans for what hap-

pened. Arenas has now fully
achieved the public pariah status
that will make him completely

unmarketable in the NBA. His
future is a now a bleak one with
certain jail time and countless
losses in earnings to come.

Nevertheless, I loved the
joke.

According to multiple sourc-

happened that led to Gilbert Are-

Lil Wayne is on top of the music industry, and he is doing it with
an alien-like work ethic, says columnist Jonathan Salm

By Jonathan Salm
c o L U M N I s T

Every decade or so, select in-
dividuals have come to dominate
the American musical landscape.

The hippies and beatniks of
the sixties and seventies had Jimi
Hendrix, Janis Joplin and the
Grateﬁil Dead. The eighties had
Michael Jackson, and the nineties
had Kurt Cobain.

For the first decade of the new
millennium, that individual is
unquestionably Lil Wayne AKA
Weezy F. Baby AKA Dwayne
Michael Carter, Jr. However rev-
olutionary his rhymes and ﬂow
may be, there remains something
a little off about Lil Wayne.

Nevermind the fact that Wayne
already sets himself apart from
other modern entertainers be-
cause of his overwhelming domi-
nance and constant presence on
the Billboard charts. It still seems
like Wayne is a little too good at
what he does. Granted, so were
Hendrix, et al, but Wayne takes it
to a whole new level.

The man records nearly every
hour he is awake (he famously
installed a studio in his tour bus
to take his beats on the road), and
he manages to consistently put
out both underground mixtapes
and platinum selling studio al-
bums while still ﬁnding the time
to make guest appearances on
tracks by artists from Birdman to
Weezer. Even GQ noticed, nam-
ing him the workaholic of the
year in 2007.

And the most ridiculous part:

-Wayne dominates the rap industry

in an era of falling sales and less
big name starts, while also man-
aging to be in a certain level of
incoherence. The man raps about
his love for swishers and codeine
cocktails and lives his life exactly

marijuana, but it hasn’t stopped
him from enjoying a little mother
nature.

Because Lil Wayne manages
to be one of the world’s hottest
and most proliﬁc hip-hop artists
while simultaneously ingest-

In fact, despite likely heading oﬂ to jail for

a weapons charge, 2010 is looking like the

year of Lil Wayne.

like his songs.

Don’t believe me? Check out
any YouTube video of Wayne
hanging out on a tour bus. The
amount of substances consumed
on his bus can rival W&L tear
night festivities.

Furthermore, Wayne is a bona
ﬁde gangster. It doesn’t matter to
him that he can legally buy a gun
— it’s much more badass to get
one on the streets and then get ar-
rested for it.

As for his love for a certain
green plant, it still remains il-
legal for him to light up. But
for someone as dedicated to his
passions as Lil Wayne, quitting
is not an option, and his persis-
tence is not only evident in his
music, but in his substance abuse
as well. Wayne has been arrested
countless times for possession of

mg insane amounts of a variety
of substances, the only logical
conclusion to come from this
is that Lil Wayne is not human.
Honestly, who can get away with
doing exactly what they want at
all times of the day? No one. It’s
physically impossible. The world
just doesn’t work that way. Well,
except for Lil Wayne, that is.

Wayne wakes up and immedi-
ately does what he loves ~ make
music and smoke weed. Not only
is he able to do what he loves; he
is wildly successful too.

Perhaps I’m just jealous and
unfairly questioning Wayne’s
humanity, but his wild success
makes this question necessary.
In fact, Wayne must have even
anticipated this article, as he
begs the question and answers it
himself in a succinct four-minute

blast in a new track aptly named
“I’m Not Human.” Lyrics like
“Re, Re, Reporting from another
world/Look up in the sky and see
me courting with a cover girl” and
“I am not a human being” only
support my theory. And the song,
a rumored cut from Wayne’s up-
coming rock debut, “Rebirth,” is
actually good!

What human hip-hop artist
can actually produce an instru-
mentally solid rap-rock track that
doesn’t disappoint? While yes,
Lil Wayne’s debut rock single,
“Prom Queen” might’ve been a
step in a more human direction, it
hasn’t hurt his success at all.

In fact, despite likely heading
off to jail for a weapons charge,
2010 is looking like the year of
Lil Wayne. His rock album “Re-
birth” will ﬁnally be released and
so will Tha Carter IV, the heavily
anticipated follow up to 2008’s
triple platinum “Tha Carter III.”
This whole ‘going to jail and
remaining awesome’ concept is
something that just doesn’t hap-
pen. Is any human really able to
do that?

The indisputable answer to
that question is no, and fortu-
nately that answer paves the path
to the truth regarding Lil Wayne’s
humanity. If Wayne does in fact
go to jail yet remains a chart-top-
ping artist, the answer is plain
and simple. However, we must
wait, as only time will tell.

into the locker room and laid
them out in front of Crittenton’s
locker with a note attached that
read, “Pick One.”

And that ladies and gentle-
men is why Gilbert Arenas is
losing nine ﬁgures and going to
jail, and you know what, it was
worth it.

Gilbert Arenas has had a his-
tory of missed jokes with bad tim-
ing, but I think this one ﬁnally hit
the spot. Crittenton was clearly
fronting on Arenas’ manlihood,
so what better way to throw it
completely back in his face?

But seriously, Arenas is losing
a lot of his life over nothing.

Yes, he does own multiple
weapons, which probably aren’t
completely needed, but consider-
ing how gun happy America re-
ally is, I ﬁnd it pretty strange to
criticize Gilbert Arenas for hav-
ing an unloaded gun when foot-
ball superstars Marvin Harrison
and Plaxico Burress have both
ﬁred loaded weapons (Harrison

allegedly ﬁred at others while
Burress only ﬁred at himself).

I know that gun violence is
a problem that America must ﬁx,
but the most violence that Are-
nas could have caused with those
guns is a bruised thigh.

Furthermore, Arenas was
widely criticized for seeming
not to care about the whole or-
deal. The media tends to side
with people who seem like they
care deeply when they make a
mistake. Mark McGwire has re-
cently been forgiven by his fans
for caring about cheating for
_ more than ten years, while Barry
Bonds continues to be reviled for
cheating for half that time.

You already know that we
live in a society that tends to
blow things out of proportion,
but maybe for once, we can all
take a little joke.

Taking a different look at everyday eroticism

Using classroom experience and deﬁnitions, Aleisha Butler reexamines the true meaning of the word “eroticism ”

By Aleisha Butler
c 0 L U M N IS T

It’s the middle of January,
and I’m sure that you’re all feel-
ing the winter ho-hums as much
as I am.

Perpetually overcast skies and
treacherously wet, icy sidewalks
do nothing to lift your mood
when you’re struggling to an 8
a.m. class. The layers of clothes
that make you waddle like a tod-
dler on his ﬁrst sled riding trip
don’t do much for your body
image, either. After the fun and
the calories of the holiday season
have passed, it’s pretty hard to
ﬁnd something to excite you, let
alone to feel sexy about.

In my English class last se-
mester we were exploring themes
of the erotic, what its overarching
deﬁnition is, and what it means
for each of us in our lives.

Erotica is deﬁned as literature
or art pertaining to sexual love or
sexual desire, while eroticism is
deﬁned as sexually suggestive

symbolism or an abnormally per-
sistent sexual drive. However, the
deﬁnition that most interested me
was one that deﬁned eroticism as
a “heightened aesthetic sense.”

This, to me, seemed the most
positive and inclusive deﬁnition,
leaving room for an erotic inter-
pretation of everyday life... and
maybe something to make the
winter months a little more inter-
esting.

Sex and sexual desire are
very often interpreted as taboo,
and not a whole lot of emphasis
is placed on achieving a sen-
sual understanding of the world
around us. We get Very caught up
in our busy, stressful, day-to-day
routine; a few extra moments of
eroticism would go a long way
towards alleviating the pressure
created by the daily grind.

So what do I mean by “mo-
ments of eroticism?” What
are they and how can one ﬁnd

them?

Alter our English class ended,
I was still confused but very in-
trigued by the idea of the erotic
in everyday life. After a lot of
thought and actual out-of-class
discussion with some friends, I

came to the tentative conclusion
that that “heightened aesthetic
sense” is a way of giving your-
self the opportunity to ﬁnd the
erotic in the world around you.
It’s a change in perspective
that you must consciously make.
The act of painting as soothing or
exciting, the steam clouds above

mundane, earthy way.

These little erotic interludes
are not necessarily sexual in na-
ture, but they make us aware of
ourselves in a way that we nor-
mally are not. Appreciating the
texture of rain on our skin or the
smell of wood smoke in our hair
the morning after a bonﬁre is

not inherently connected to sex,
but by being more aware of our-
selves we are only more aware of
the possibilities that our bodies
offer us.

I would like to return to the
notion of eroticism as an “ab—
normally persistent sexual drive”
and offer a different perspective.
A sensual, perceptive understand-
ing of your body and the way it
moves through space, the way it
interacts with other elements and
people around it, is critical for a
healthy, self-aware existence.

Sexual desire is not evil, and
acknowledging the slightly sexu-
al pull that you feel for a cup of
hot coffee, a pair of designer sti-
lettos or that vintage Aston-Mar-
tin is not weird. It’s human.

It is human to experience
desire and excitement over the
things that make us feel alive,
and we perceive those sensations
with our bodies.

Trying to build some eroti-
cism into your everyday life is
not abnormal; it just requires a
little patience, as we never really
think about interpreting everyday
life in a sensual, charged way.

This winter, think about your
favorite cozy sweater more like
an old, reliable lover. Think
about how much ass you could
kick in those thick, heavy snow
boots.

And, as one of my roommates
has said, chicken noodle soup re-
ally is a hug for your insides.

Last semester I wrote about
ﬁnding passion in your life, for
the little or the big things, and
this idea of everyday sexuality is
very much the same.

Seniors should enjoy their last few months, not fear them

As graduation approaches, law student Jordan Rothman advises the seniors to relax during their last days on campus

By Jordan Rothman
COLU M NIST

One year ago, I was in the
shoes of many seniors at this
university. I was scared at the
uncertainty of my future, and a
little bit saddened by the thought
of my impending graduation.

I had classes to tend to, a the-
sis to write, and through it all, I
had to try and have a good time
through all the stresses and anxi-
eties of senior year.

One year older and wiser, I
realize that much of this trepida-
tion was unwarranted. Life does
not end when college ends, and
graduation does not have to be
such a saddening and depressing
event.

Furthermore, experiencing
my senior year has given me
ﬁrst—hand knowledge about what
the seniors at this university can
expect in the upcoming months.

I’d like to convey this infor-
mation along with a little advice
about how to tackle one’s senior
year.

In many ways, graduating can
appear to be a lot like dying. Tru-
ly, it may seem like graduation is
the end of one’s existence, and I
can reasonably see why someone
who has spent the past 4 years at
the same enterprise would deem
this viewpoint to be the case.

 

People try to console seniors,
try to tell them that everything
will be alright. Yet, as they fran-
tically search for something to
do post-graduation, and are bur-
dened by pressing academic con-
cerns, it appears like graduation
is something to be feared. V

may be unable to pursue what
one truly desires in this world
while a college student. Yet, all
this changes at graduation, and I
can’t stress enough how positive
commencement can be.

One piece of advice that I
would like to give to the seniors
is not to worry about what they

will be doing post-graduation.
Few, if any, students know early
on in the year what their exact
plans will be after commence-
ment. I

Still, there is no need to have a
“quarter-life crisis” because you
are unsure of your future plans.
In fact, I have had friends who
didn’t get jobs until right around
graduation or later, and they are
perfectly happy at their current
vocations.

Furthermore, I can’t stress
enough how good it might be to
take a break between graduation
and the next part of your life.
Truly, you cannot underestimate
the power of a “gap year,” as this
time is a unique opportunity that
you may never again have for the
rest of your life.

Five, ten or ﬁfteen years from
now, you will probably be in a
long term relationship, have a
job, have a mortgage, and be
bound by a number of other obli-

seriously impede your capacity
in the future to travel, dedicate
yourself to national service, or do
something that you have always
desired.

Do not feel pressured by fam-
ily, societal inﬂuences, or other

forces to simply go straight to
graduate school, for if you do,
you will be wasting a valuable
opportunity.

Personally, I could not see
myself taking time off between
undergrad and law school, and
I have seen ﬁrst—hand some dis-
advantages of taking this path.
All told, these are the last years
of your youth, and don’t waste
them away through additional
study and toil.

As your senior year progress-
es, you will ﬁnd that everyone’s
inhibitions begin to lower. Con-
fronted with the impending
graduation, people are especially
sincere to others about their feel-
ings, and are willing to do wild
and crazy things. I would take
full advantage of this. Now, I
don’t mean to imply that you
should utilize this condition in a
nefarious way.

What I do mean is that you
should reconnect with your class-
mates in an honest fashion dur-
ing your last months of college.
For instance, close to graduation
last year, I had people come up
to me and tell me how much they
appreciated my presence in their
lives. I in turn was also sincere
about my feelings, and used the

last vestiges of my “collegiate
immunity” to do the wildest and
craziest things of my college ca-
reer.

All told, the closer it is to
graduation, the more inclined
people will be to have fun and
loosen up. I hope you take full
advantage of this situation, so
that you can enjoy the last days
of your college experience to the
fullest.

Graduation is not the end of
the world, no matter how you
may feel about it now. In fact, it
can be the beginning of a won-
derful chapter in your life, and I
encourage all who are capable to
use their post-graduation years
toward attaining experiences
they will be unable to have later
in life.

You know, most people say
that these are the best times of
your life, and I would add to this
by defending that senior year is
probably better than any other
part of the college experience.

In the end, I hope you enjoy
this time to the fullest, and don’t
let graduation or an uncertain fu-
ture wear you down.

Sexual assault articles are detrimental

Writer takes issue with series of sexaul assault accounts that appeared last term.

Rape and sexual assault at
Washington and Lee are serious
problems that warrant close ex-
amination and demand our every
effort to provide an effective so-
lution.

An environment where sexual
assault and rape exist is the exact
opposite of what should deﬁne
the Washington and Lee commu-
nity. This problem will be solved
primarily through awareness,
and the forum that has been cre-
ated by campus programs such as
One-in-F our, End It, and the Red
Flag Campaign have been an im-
portant step towards creating a
better informed and more visible
discussion of the problems on
W&L’s campus.

That being said, there are both
effective and ineffective ways
to promote the discussion that
will be central to ending sexual
assault on campus. Publishing
graphic accounts of rape in the
Ring-Tum Phi every week is not
an efﬁcient way to promote this
important discussion.

The victim’s accounts of rape
and sexual assault are tackling an
important issue that makes steer-

ing away from a culture of sexual
assault difﬁcult: many people do
not truly believe the egregious
terms that the statistics dictate.
But these accounts, intended to
raise awareness, are graphic to
the point that they seem to be an
accusation that stiﬂes the same
open forum on sexual relations
that they aim to encourage.

It has become easier to talk
about the graphic nature of the
accounst published in the Phi
each week than the underlying
problems in the culture that are
the cause of the behavior. Con-
versation tends towards the vul-
garity of these stories, and not
what can be done to better gen-
der relations.

Because these stories are so
frequent and graphic, they have
come to dominate the discussion
of sexual assault and rape on
campus. This carries the discus-
sion to the extremes of what is
going on, and can prevent mean-
ingful actions from being taken.

Changing a culture that pro-
motes sexual assault will require
meaningful interactions from,
and participations by, both of the

genders.

Making men read stories
about rape while using the re-
stroom does not encourage any
participation. In fact, doing so
creates an extreme image of the
situation that discourages par-
ticipation and makes it much
easier to say, “That type of thing
does not apply to me.” This is a
huge problem; sexual assault is
an issue that applies to the entire
community at W&L.

The Red Flag Initiative has
been a successful method of in-
creasing awareness of sexual
assault and gender issues on
campus. The Red Flag posters
describe a situation that could
easily occur on campus and then
point out what is wrong with a
certain behavior.

The posters have challenged
issues that are present at W&L,
such as students trying to get their
dates drunk so they will hook up
with them, without resorting to
the frequent and graphic images
that characterize the stories of
rape across campus.

These posters encourage
conversation and participation

of people from both sexes and
all sexual orientations because
they don’t portray one group as
the problem and the other as the
victim.

It would be convenient to
write that these stories do not be-
long in the Phi because they rep-
resent things that do not happen
on campus. Hopefully, someone
will be able to argue that in the
future. Unfortunately this is not
the reality at our university.

The victims accounts are
necessary because they bring at-
tention to the fact that this type
of behavior exists and is a real
problem.

What is not necessary is pub-
lishing them in the Ring-Tum Phi
every week, and placing copies
in men’s rooms across campus.
Doing so is counterproductive; it
detracts from the very conversa-
tion on our campus that they aim
to beneﬁt.

Leadership:
Emibl Coyle

What energizes you about taking on
leadership responsibilities? I love being
able to give back to the organizations that
I’m involved in, and to help rising classes of
W&L students derive the joy and benefits
that I have found in these organizations.
Riding, for instance, has completely framed
my life here. Through Captains Council I
can serve as a resource to other captains in
other sports. Ultimately, we all face similar
leadership challenges and development even though W&L boasts
upward of 20 very different varsity sports. Greek life gives me a
similar energy: I enjoy helping first-year women navigate the Greek
system here. What has been one of your most rewarding
aspects of leadership at W&L? One of the most rewarding
aspects of leadership at W&L is that leadership here comes in all
forms and in a variety of both traditional and unconventional ven-
ues. Although being captain of an athletic team is a pretty conven-
tional leadership role, riding outside of the collegiate setting is an
individual sport. It is exhilarating to work with my teammates to
foster a team dynamic and to work towards a common goal, some-
thing that as varsity college athletes they may actually never have
done before coming to W&L though many of them have competed
in our sport for twelve or more years.

What legacy of leadership do you hope to leave for oth-
ers who follow you here? I hope to leave my unique perspec-
tive on the issues that I have tackled here. We all bring something
different to the conversation and that shouldn’t disappear when we
‘graduate. Any words of advice for them? If you want to be
involved here, you can be, and if you want your voice to be heard,
there are people who will listen. Simply do what energizes you I

Fresh new music picked by WLUR

W&L s only campus radio station tells us what ﬁve artists to watch in 201 0 for new sounds, releases and hot concerts

ByWLUR staff
surr wnmzns

It’s impossible to know what
other wonders Lady Gaga will
grace us with this year, but here
are WLUR’s picks for some oth-
er artists to watch in the ﬁrst part
of 2010:

1. Vampire Weekend

While early 2008 saw the re-
lease of the group’s much-praised
self-titled album, the buzz sur-
rounding Vampire Weekend
continues to swell thanks to the
release of the group’s sophomore
record, Contra, on XL Record-
ings last week. And what a way
to ring in the new year. With
songs that blend delicate guitar
picking and keyboard twiddling
with Afro-pop percussion, Con-
tra sets the bar high as far as in-

die pop goes in 2010.

While a lot of folks go either
way about this band ~ some see
these Ivy League prepsters as
endearing for their lyrics that
question the importance of the
Oxford comma and somehow
bookend the words “Cape Cod”
and “Kwassa Kwassa,” while
others blast them for their preten-
tiousness and as little more than
copycats of what Paul Simon did
on his classic 1986 album Grace-
land — this new record is most
certainly a step forward in their
songwriting. Contra is sure to

please old fans and ﬁnd a place
on the iPods of plenty of new lis-
teners too. And for those willing
to make the trek up to D.C., the
band will be playing DAR Con-
stitution Hall in early April.

2. Beach House

Another group that’s steadily
rising in the ranks of the indie
world, Beach House is known
for its blend of reverb-drenched
guitar and murky keyboards, not
to mention the deep-honeyed
voice of singer Victoria Legrand.
Legrand makes up one half of
this dynamic duo, formed in Bal-
timore in 2004, which has since
become a master of what many
call “dream pop.” Appropriately
enough, the group’s third record,
Teen Dream, was recorded in
a converted church in upstate
New York that the band dubbed
“Dreamland.”

The new album is due out
this week on Sub Pop Records,
home of indie staples like Blit-
zen Trapper, The Shins, and Iron
and Wine. And Teen Dream is
the much-anticipated follow-up
to the group’s last release, Devo-
tion, which deﬁnitively claimed
a spot as one of WLUR’s top
ten albums of 2008. Fans of ev-
eryone from Grizzly Bear to the
Velvet Underground will easily

Smashing it:
Gamers seek to
set record

By Holly Suthers
STAFF WRITER

Students aim for a spot on the

list of Guinness World Records
for their 24-hour Super Smash
Brothers session last spring

Not many Washington and
Lee students can claim to have
a world record, however, three
students recently achieved this
title through gaming.

Chris Veddem, Phil Jack-
son, Jennifer Pritchett, all soph-
omores, and Arturo Roa, who
graduated last year, performed
the longest non-stop game of

article.

Avid Nintendo 64 gamers,
the four have been playing for
years. Pritchett has been this
system for seven years and has
played Super Smash Broth-
ers for two years. Veddem has
been playing for nine. The team
decided to play Super Smash
Brothers because it allowed

tsounded like a good story to tell later

in life. ‘What did you do during college? ’

‘Set a world record.

Jennlfer Prltchett, sophomore record setter
 

Super Smash Brother on Nin-
tendo 64.

The four students played
the game for 24 hours and ﬁve
minutes. Each member played
the entire duration, withstand-
ing the challenges.

“The length of it was most
taxing for me. It may not seem
like it, sitting still and main-
taining focus for that length of
time can be quite exhausting,”
said Veddem.

Veddem and Pritchett said
that once they initially had the
idea for the world record, they
had to follow through with it.

“It sounded like a good sto-
ry to tell later in life. ‘What did
you do during college?’ ‘Set a
world record,’” said Pritchett.

Pritchett contacted Guin-
ness World Records in Sep-
tember of 2008 and ﬁnalized
the paper work this past April.
As part of the validation pro-
cess to Guiness, the group must
have a newspaper article writ-
ten to validate the event. The
Ring—tum Phi will serve as this

each player to have inﬁnite
lives, and therefore they could
play one continuous game.

This past May, the four sat
down to start playing and ﬁn-
ished an entire day later to room
full of people cheering them on
for the last ﬁve minutes.

“Cheering doesn’t often
happen in the world of gaming.
That was by far the best part,”
said Pritchett.

While each student individ-
ually played, the four recognize
that it was a team effort from
the start.

“Those who aided us in the
logistics of running the world
record attempt and watched,
you know who you are and I
can’t thank you enough for sup-
porting our endeavor,” Pritchett
said.

be seduced by Beach House’s
ghostly tunes. And converts to
the Beach House sound can check
the group out for a homecoming

show in Baltimore in May.
3. Midlake
Midlake is the seasoned

veteran of this short list, hav-

folkier sound, inspired by British
artists like Fairport Convention.
Frontman Tim Smith told indie
music Web site Pitchfork Me-
dia that it was the “fair maiden”
quality of British folk that really
resonated when the band set to
making Courage. Perhaps in an

ing formed in Denton, Texas in
1999. Yet the group has only
released two records, and its last
record, The Trials of Van Occu-
panther, came out way back in
2006. Still, Midlake’s sound has
been praised for its unabashed
nods to classic rock artists like
Neil Young, Jethro Tull, and
F leetwood Mac.

According to the band’s la-
bel, Bella Union, Midlake’s new
record, The Courage of Others,
will trade the ‘70s-era rock for a

effort to get closer to their British
inﬂuences, these guys have left
the states for a bit of a European
tour before they return to some
shows in the western U.S.

4. Yeasayer

Another New York act —
though they hail from Brooklyn,
not Broadway — Yeasayer is a
staunch defender of experimen-
tal psychedelic rock. The group
has toured with more eccentric
acts like Beck, MGMT, and Man
Man, and it’s safe to say that

Yeasayer is even quirkier than
Vampire Weekend and gloomier
than Beach House. (If it helps,
the band members themselves
refer to the group’s sound “Mid-
dle Eastem-psych-pop-snap-gos-
pel.”) While experimental and
art-rock acts like Animal Collec-
tive and Dirty Projectors topped
many best-of lists in 2009, Yea-
sayer is set to throw its name into
the ring when its new record,
Odd Blood, is released in early
February on Secretly Canadian.
If lead single “Ambling Alp” is
any indication, they might be
poised to claim 2010. The group
is touring all over Europe and the
U.S. for the next several months,
with a stop at D.C.’s 9:30 Club
on April 3.

5. jj

Swedish indie-popper jj re-
leased its debut album, jj n° 2,
early last year on a label back
home. The record earned jj a
spot in Pitchfork’s coveted “Best
New Music” list and since then,
the group has signed to American
label Secretly Canadian. Now, jj
n° 3 is due out in early March,
just before these elecro-pop aﬁ-
cionados embark on a U.S. tour
with the xx (how appropriate).

The group is known for being
pretty secretive, but perhaps as it

continues to project its own brand
of pop — which draws inﬂuences
from everything from Lil Wayne
to Brian Eno — the members of jj
will come out of their shell just
a little bit.

Other artists with early 2010
releases: Spoon, Eels, RJD2, The
Magnetic Fields, Hot Chip, Mas-
sive Attack, The Watson Twins,
David Byrne & Fatboy Slim,
Shout Out Louds, Ted Leo & the
Pharmacists, The White Stripes,
She & Him, Los Campesinos!,
Interpol, LCD Soundsystem,
MGMT, Lil Wayne, and Joanna
Newsom, among others.

Lady Generals on the rise

After dropping to a 2-6 record, W&L women have improved to 6-7

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WR ITER

After struggling through their ﬁrst few
games over Christmas break and bottom-
ing out with a 2-6 record after a tough
48-47 loss to Virginia Wesleyan on Janu-
ary 5th, the women’s basketball team has
turned their season around.

The incredibly young, but also im-
mensely talented, team has struggled to
ﬁnd consistency this season. This problem

W&L has gone 4-1 and put itself right
back in the thick of the ODAC conference
race.

“Our goal from day one has been to
win the ODAC championship and I think
this win streak is just giving us more con-
ﬁdence that we can reach our goal,” said
sophomore forward Becca Bolton.

Becca Bolton, sophomore forward

was evidenced during the Surf and Slam
San Diego Hoops Classic over Christmas
Break, where the Generals knocked off a
highly touted Capital University team, but
then were blown out by Pt. Loma Naza-
rene just two days later.

Washington and Lee dropped two more
conference games when they got back, los-
ing to Randolph Macon and Virginia Wes-
leyan. The Wesleyan game was particu-
larly tough to swallow as the Generals lost
48-47 thanks to a buzzer-beating jumper.

The shots just weren’t falling for W&L.
But since the loss to Virginia Wesleyan,

in any of the previous four games, the of-
fense ﬁnally exploded and the talented and
youthful squad lived up to its potential.-
The Generals rattled off three quick wins,
beating Lynchburg (72-52), Randolph
(85-48), and Eastern Mennonite (66-46).

Facing off against Randolph, all 11
players on the Generals squad put them-
selves on the board. The team, led by
sophomore guard Meg Ingram’s 18 points,
also tied a school record for three-pointers
in a game with 12.

The team’s success continued three
days later versus EMU, with four double-

digit scorers for the Gennies and the sec-
ond consecutive game where the team shot
above 45% from the ﬂoor.

On Friday, the team suffered a minor
setback, dropping a close game to Roanoke
by a score of 57-54. Bolton ﬁlled the score
sheet with an impressive double-double,
putting up a solid 15-point, 15-rebound ef-
fort. Sophomore guard Kari Pfannenstein
netted 16 points as well.

On Saturday, the team traveled to
Bridgewater to face off against its seventh
conference foe in a row. The team came
back just in time to enjoy Tear Night ac-
tivities with a satisfying 67-58 win. Bolton
notched her sixth double-double of the
year with 20 points and 18 boards. Junior
forward Felice Herman chipped in with 19
points and 12 rebounds.

“I think we have been playing better
lately because we have ﬁnally learned how
to play together,” Bolton said. “I think it
took us a little while to ﬁgure out how to
play with each other because we are so
young, but it has started clicking lately.”

The surging Generals start off the sec-
ond half of the season with a home game
against Hollins University on Tuesday
night. Tipoff is set for 7 p.m.

Men’s basketball knocked off by a free throw

The Generals fought Roanoke to the buzzer, but couldn ’t pull off the win, losing 60-59

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

Junior gmard Jason Cimino stepped up
when the Generals needed him the most.
Drilling a three-pointer with 16 seconds
left in the men’s showdown against Roa-
noke Saturday night, Cimino tied the score
at 59-59. The Generals looked poised to
charge into their second overtime game of
the week after knocking off conference foe
Lynchburg 63-59 in OT on Wednesday. A
win would have boosted the Generals’ vic-
tory count to 10 and put the team in good
position to continue its quest for an NCAA
tournament berth.

But a lone free throw by the Maroons
kept the Generals (9-5, 2-4) from victory,
and Roanoke defeated W&L 60-59.

The Generals ﬁnished the night making
10-11 free throws while Roanoke dropped
in 11 of 21.

In a game where neither team led by
more than ﬁve points in the ﬁrst half, the
close ﬁnish was a tough pill to swallow.

Roanoke led by only three at the half,
heading into the locker room up 26-23.
But they came out shooting in the second
half and quickly jumped to an 1 1-point lead

with a little under nine minutes left in the
game. The Generals battled back, but their
last minute charge was simply too little,
too late.

Senior forward Ben Goetsch led the
Generals with 16 points and eight rebounds.
Fellow senior forwards Zac White and An-
drew Payne ﬁnished with 12 points and six
rebounds and nine points and six rebounds,
respectively. Cimino ﬁnished with five
points and ﬁve assists.

After setting up a nice three-game win-
ning streak to open their games over Christ-
mas break, the Generals have stumbled in
conference play recently.

The Generals dominated the W&L tour-
nament the ﬁrst week of January, knocking
off Swarthmore 59-48 and Emory 76-65.
But their hot streak met its match when the
team took on Eastern Mennonite three days
later. The 24th-ranked Royals used a 19-
point half time lead to run the Generals out
8348. Tumovers and poor shooting plagued
the Generals as they shot just 32.7 percent
and turned the ball over 23 times.

The Generals’ shooting woes contin-

ued against Virginia Wesleyan as the 12th
ranked Marlins posted a 16-4 run to claim
a 69-64 victory over W&L. The Generals
posted just one ﬁeld goal. Goetsch had a
double-double to lead the Generals with 24
points and 11 rebounds. White added ﬁve
points and 10 boards. F irst-year forward
Taylor Gilﬁllan stepped up with eight points
and three rebounds.

W&L recovered with the overtime
win against Lynchburg. They improved
to 45.6 percent shooting from the ﬂoor
and out-rebounded the Hornets 47-36. But
turnovers continued to be a problem for the
Generals with 29 and they shot a dismal
5-of—l4 from the free throw line.

With the Generals’ next four con-
ference games on the road, they’ll need
to keep their turnovers in check and their
shooting up to stay in play for ODAC title
contention.

The Generals’ next match-up is
against Methodist College at 7:00 p.m. on
Wednesday.

How bad can the Nets get?

The New Jersey Nets have won only three games in a season that “is nothing short of catastrophic ” ‘

By Adam Cancryn

Can one bad year ruin an entire de-
cade? For the New Jersey Nets, it is quite
a possibility.

The Nets are slogging through an NBA
season that is nothing short of catastroph-
ic. They are last in the league in defense,
25.5 games out of ﬁrst, perpetually injured
and already on their third head coach in
four months. The result is a pathetically
abysmal record of 3-36.

There are few organizations in the
sporting world that have ever been this
bad. Major League Baseball’s New York
Mets went 40-120 in their inaugural sea-
son. But even as the game’s benchmark of
ineptitude, the Mets still won 25 percent
of their games.

The Nets? 7.9 percent.

Then there’s the woeful Detroit Lions
of 2008. They were routinely embarrassed
on both sides of the ball, by opponents and
themselves. One of the team’s few high-
lights is quarterback Dan Orlovsky unwit-
tingly running out of the back of his own
end zone to avoid pressure. Needless to
say, the Lions went the entire season with-
out a victory.

But at least in Detroit there was a ray
of hope. Calvin Johnson, a freakishly built
second-year player, established himself as
a top 10 receiver despite catching passes
from ﬁve equally dreadful passers.

All the Nets have to offer on their team
of oft-injured underachievers is center
Brook Lopez. While he’s a solid player,
nothing short of the second coming of Pat-

rick Ewing can save this season.

And although the Lions were at least
assured the No. 1 pick in the subsequent
draft, the Nets hold no such certainty.
True, they will have the best chance in the
NBA’s lottery-style draft, but only four
times in the past 24 years has_ the league’s
worst team won the top pick.

There are a number of other teams
across the athletic spectrum that were
similarly bad. But few, if any, found them-
selves with so many things going wrong all
at once. Aside from the irreparably dam-
aged product on the court, the franchise is
the ﬁnancial equivalent of a sinking ship.
Even before this year, the Nets consistent-
ly ranked in the bottom ﬁve in attendance
and were slotted 26 out of 30 this year in
total franchise value by Forbes.

Now pile on a once-lucrative plan to
move to Brooklyn that currently sits dead
in the water. And then add to that a new
owner, Mikhail Prokhorov, who happens
to have connections to the Russian mob.

It’s a sad situation that will unfortu-
nately overshadow what was the Nets’
most successful decade since the 1970s.

Aided by the arrival of perennial all-
star Jason Kidd and rookie Richard Jef-
ferson in 2001, the team engineered a
26—game turnaround, ﬁnishing 56-30 and
reaching the NBA Finals. Vince Carter
joined a couple years later, establishing
the pre-Celtics version of the Big Three.
Only the dominance of the Western Con-
ference prevented a Nets’ Finals victory.

Nine years into the decade, the Nets
had established themselves as more than
just that team across the river. They racked
up 348 wins, six straight playoff appear-
ances, four ﬁrst place ﬁnishes and played
in two ﬁnals.

But those accomplishments have been
smothered by the stench emanating from
this season, a stench likely to go down as
the worst in history.

Through 39 games, the Nets have just
three victories, putting them on pace for
a ﬁnal record of 6-76. That would eclipse
the previous worst of 9-73 established
by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1973. New
Jersey already owns the league mark for
consecutive losses to open a season, with
18. When coach Lawrence Frank was ﬁred
at 0-16, it seemed like more of a favor to
Frank than to the team.

Unfortunately, the recovery will not
occur as quickly as the demise. Like ev-
erything else that has collapsed in the 21st
century, it will take time. A No.1 pick and
the rights to precocious point guard John
Wall would help. So would a major free
agent signing like Dwyane Wade, Chris
Bosh or LeBron James. But none of that
is certain and each loss seemingly pushes
the idea of a speedy revival farther from
grasp.

In a year that turned the Nets’ trium-
phant ‘Aughts into the sickening Aint’s,
we can be sure of only one thing: it has to
be better next year. Doesn’t it?
