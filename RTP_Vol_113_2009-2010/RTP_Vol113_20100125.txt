Low stats
despite risks

W&L shows more responsible
behavior on infamous Tear
Night this year I -

By Killeen King
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee students took safety more
seriously on Tear Night this year than they have in
the past.

Tear Night, which fell on Jan. 16, is the night where
students celebrate joining their respective Greek or-
ganizations. It has traditionally been one of the most
excessive drinking occasions for W&L students.
Because of this, Lexington Police and the Student
Health Center consider Tear Night one of the most
dangerous nights for students. But this year turned
out better than past years.

Lexington Police LieutenantA. M. Miller said that
police arrested no students on Tear Night this year.

The Student Health Center had 20 percent fewer
alcohol-related visits this Tear Night than they had last
year, according to Doctor Jane Horton.

“The largest decline was in visits by male stu-
dents—they were down by two-thirds,” said Horton.

Fewer students visited the ER and fewer students
stayed in the health center overnight, said Horton.
There was also a lower BAC average this year com-

“Those consequences are pre-
ventable students... did not
make drinking choices that are
diﬂerent... because they are
celebrating new members
joining a fraterntiy or sorority. ”

DR. JANE HORTON, director of the student
health center

pared to last year.

But, not all ofthe statistics were down. According
to Horton, more female students visited the health
center this Tear Night. 7

Both Horton and Miller agree that Tear Night
remains a high-risk event and that students should be
more aware of the dangers.

Miller said that he usually sends out an extra po-
liceman on Tear Night. This sixth policeman serves
as a safety precaution. But Tear Night is not the worst
night for Lexington police.

“Our worst nights are Homecoming and Alumni
Weekends,” said Miller.

When asked what is the best way to control ex-
cessive alcohol consumption on Tear Night, Miller
responded, “People need to be held accountable for
the things they do when they are intoxicated.”

The school the policemen can only do so much.
Students need to take responsibility for their own ac-
tions and for each other’s actions said Miller.

Miller said that he understands that alcohol is a big
part ofthe W&L social scene. “We are not telling you
not to drink; we are telling you to drink responsibly,”
he said.

Horton also acknowledged that alcohol encom-
passes a large part of the social scene and that on
Tear Night students consume even more alcohol than
normal.

“Students in general, and particularly ﬁrst-year
and female students, have an increased risk of expe-
riencing negative health consequences from overuse
of alcohol,” said Horton.

Horton explained that negative health consequences
include vomiting, blacking out, injury and unintended
or unprotected sexual intercourse.

“All ofthose consequences are preventable if stu-
dents would choose to follow lower-risk guidelines
for alcohol use and did not make drinking choices that
are different from how they usually drink just because
they are celebrating new membersjoining a fraternity’
or sorority,” said Horton.

The police and the school cannot ﬁx the excessive
drinking problem, said Miller. It needs to come from
the students themselves. The problem can only be fully
addressed when students step up to the plate and take
responsibility.

Several student groups have gath-
ered to raise funds for the three
million residents affected by the 7.0
magnitude earthquake that struck the
coast of Haiti nearly two weeks ago.

Though poverty is not a new prob-
lem for Haiti, the natural disaster has
shed light on the ongoing crisis and
brought poverty to the attention of
organizations and individuals around
the world.

At Washington and Lee, students
have created an ad hoc group for the
purpose of raising funds to relieve
Haitian distress.

Though some of these students
belong to other organizations that
are dedicated to the united front of
social justice, diversity, or commu-
nity service, students have put their
particular interests aside to focus on
a single cause.

The group, called Change for
Haiti, gathers students from organiza-
tions such as the Caribbean Society,
the Bonner Leaders Program, the
Nabors Service.League, the Multi-
cultural Student Association (MSA),
Action Change Tomorrow (ACT),
Amnesty lntemational, Hillel, and the
StudentAssociation for International
Learning (SAIL).

Caitlin Edgar, who is a member
of the Bonner Leaders Program,
said: “We no longer live in an insular
world. What affects our neighboring
nations affects us. In addition, any
harm or devastation caused to another
human heart, mind or body should
elicit the same level of concern from
us as ifthey were ourselves.”

The group began its fundraising at
the Martin Luther King keynote ad-
dress by placing donation receptacles

For every person who eats lunch at
the Marketplace this Friday, January

The foundation also helps local
families become more independent

building “happy homes,” cardboard

earthquake, nearly 1.5 million
people were displaced and the group
has already begun to ration supplies

Celebrating a legacy

Along with MLK day, W&L remembers the civil rights hero in a week-long series of events

By Chelsea Stevenson
STAFF WRITER

Members of the Washington I

and Lee law, undergraduate and
Rockbridge area communities col-
laborated in putting together a series
of events in honor of Martin Luther
King, Jr.

The past two weeks at W&L have
consisted of keynote speakers, ﬁlms,
a community service project and
even a birthday party.

The series of events started off
with a showing of the 2004 film
“Crash,” on Tuesday, Jan. 12.

The ﬁlm, starring Sandra Bullock,
focuses on tolerance, acceptance and
racism: all causes for which King
fought.

According to Dean Tamara F utrell,
chairman ofthe Martin Luther King
planning committee, interracial
equality is still a struggle in today’s
community and the ﬁlm properly il-
lustrates this issue.

The second event of the week was
a community service project that took
place on Saturday, Jan. 16.

People throughout the community
donated school supplies to the Rock-
bridge Middle School, in celebration
of King’s passion for education.

School supplies such as protrac-
tors, compasses and glue sticks were
requested out of need, but all supplies
were graciously welcomed.

Following the community service that still exist in our society, even

project, there was a keynote speaker
on Sunday, Jan. l7. -

Julian Bond, the chairman of the
NAACP (National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People)
and a student of Martin Luther King,
gave the keynote address to the com-
munity in Lee Chapel.

Bond founded the Student Non-
violent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC) in 1960 and was an activist
during the Civil Rights movement.

He discussed several of his ex-
periences in his speech, “The Road
to the Dream: from Alabama to
Obama.” His speech addressed issues

with Obama’s inauguration.

Exposing the terror of torture

New Yorker staﬂ writer, Jane Mayer, speaks out against American use of alternative methods to interrogate detainees

By Victoria Taylor
STAFF WRITER

Jane Mayer appeared at ease.
Sitting comfortably and conﬁdent
on the Stackhouse stage, the New
Yorker staff writer answered ques-
tions Thursday about a topic that
causes many to cringe: the United
States’ dealings with torture.

Mayer has done the legwork to
merit discussing such a polarizing
topic with poise.

She addresses the matter in
her newest book, “The Dark Side:
The Inside Story of How the War
on Terror Turned into a War on
American Ideals.”

In the book, she looks at the
American military and CIA7s use
of techniques like water-boarding,
stress positions and sleep depriva-
tion against prisoners.

In the aftermath of the 9/ 11
terrorist attacks, Mayer said, Vice
President Dick Cheney and his

adviser David Addington took the -

opportunity to further an agenda
to augment presidential powers.
She said the new interrogation
methods being used in the War on
Terror raised questions on what

constitutes severe punishment.

“The United States doesn’t
have a lot of history of purposely
torturing people,” she said.

“We haven’t spent a lot of time
ﬁguring out how many ﬁngernails
we can or cannot pull out of
someone.”

Mayer said she found that

Futrell wished that more W&L
students had attended the speaker
‘because the majority of the sup-
port was from local residents.

However Amber King, a soph-
omore and member of the Martin
Luther King planning committee,
not only attended but was given
the opportunity to introduce Bond
before his speech.

“I got to have dinner with him
prior to the event and he is a very
down-to-earth person,” said Coo-
per on her impression of Bond.

Cooper became involved with
the planning committee for Mar-
tin Luther King through her em-
ployment under Futrell. Her work
mostly included publicity.

Bond’s speech prefaced the
actual national holiday, and the

“I think the best tonic for
wrongdoing in high places is to

“You stop abuse by showing it.”

stricter airline guidelines, were
needed.

was entitled “The Dark Side: How

Detainees, Water-Boarding and
War Crimes Liability.”

Mayer answered his initial
questions before opening the
ﬁoor to the audience of students,
faculty and community members
who braved the ice and freezing
rain to attend.

When asked whether the im-
ages that could lead to radical
action, like those of tortured
detainees, should be published,
Mayer cited the United States’
history of self-correction.

Senior journalism major Me-

Lexington police shell out too many parking tickets

Now in his fourth year dealing with the daily frustrations of two hour parking,

By James Baird
COLUMNIST

Dear Lexington Police De-
partment,

I am writing this letter to in-
form you of my absolute joy at
receiving two parking citations
over the span of ﬁve business
days.

However, in my current state
of ecstasy, I would like to bring
to your attention a number of
recommendations and, some
might say, criticisms ofthe man-
ner in which these lovely letters
of happiness are issued.

I would like to preface this
tirade by saying that I live off-
campus in a house that is over a
mile away. from the university,
and although I do own a bicycle
and am a rabid environmentalist,
I drive my Tahoe to class on a
daily basis unless it’s warm and
the sun is shining. "

The parking situation is grim.
In the uncommon event there is
an open spot in the Red Square
lot near Beta (capacity: fewer
than 30 vehicles), I park there
and breathe a sigh of relief.

Otherwise, I am faced with an
unfortunate dilemma. Do I drive
around the block and look for a
spot on the street, or do I park in
the university’s parking garage?

Should I choose the former, I
run the risk ofﬁnding a cute neon
green envelope stamped VIOLA-
TION in sickeningly large and
official font tucked neatly under
my windshield wiper upon ﬁn-
ishing class.

Should I choose the latter,
I am forced to walk half a mile
to get to the fraternity house, a
walk I will have to make since I
eat breakfast at the house every
morning.

One hundred percent of the
time I choose to risk the ticket in
hopes it will outweigh the cost of
the time it takes to walk to and
from the parking garage.

When I do receive a ticket, I
take issue for a speciﬁc reason.
Every violation I have received
has been issued while my car is
parked in one of the spots around
Red Square.

This includes and is limited
to the tail end of Main Street (in
front of PIKA) and West Henry
Street (in front of Phi Delt). The
signs are pretty clear: two hour
parking Monday through Friday
during peak business hours, but
who on God’s green earth is go-

around that area. There is Stop-
In (with its own abnormally large
parking lot that is never full), the
Patisserie (also with its own lot)
and that model shop (surprise! It
has a lot, too). Have I ever seen
any of those lots ﬁlled in over
three years that I’ve attended this

V I can certainly understand why two-hour

parking might be a good idea in the mid-
dle of Main Street (by the Southern Inn,

say), but around Red Square? Give me a

break.

 

ing to park there besides Wash-
ington and Lee students and/or
fraternity employees? Answer:
no one.

Let’s examine the businesses

school? Nope. Have they ever

been ﬁlled? Not likely. There-
fore, customers of those busi-
nesses do not park on the street
and do not need those spaces.

I can certainly understand
why two-hour parking might be a
good idea in the middle of Main
Street (by the Southern Inn, say),
but around Red Square? Give me
a break.

The people awarded those
tickets are almost exclusively
students, and guess what? Stu-
dents have class! I, and others,
don’t try to leave our vehicles
on the street for more than two
hours, but I, and others, have at
least two consecutive hours of
class ﬁve days a week. Unfortu-
nately I’m not the type to walk
out ofclass and down the hill to
move my ear.

Dear Lexington police, here's
a grand idea: how about you of-
fer W&L students parking pass-
es to park in areas around the
fraternity houses and academic
buildings for six or 12 hours at a
time at a one-time rate.

Granted, you do offer a
“Hunting Pass Parking Program”
(random name, by the way), but
oh wait, there is a waiting list,

James Baird releases his frustration

among other things (see: www.
ci.lexington.va.us/parkhunt.
htm).

It will save you time and
manpower, but you might be out
a few thousand dollars a year
(maybe you could sell one of
your Chargers to fill that hole).
Oh, and it will be good for public
relations, something with which
you usually struggle. I appreci-
ate the job your department per-
forms, but when I walk down the
street and see green slips left and
right, I can see why students get
frustrated.

Jews are accepted and embraced at Washington andLee

After hearing about alleged intolerance, a law student commends the religious outreach and support for his faith

By Jordan Rothman
C0 LUM N I ST

I have wanted to attend Wash-
ington and Lee for a long time. I
remember reading about Robert
E. Lee and discovering that he
was the president of a southern
college after the Civil War.

I later researched this institu-
tion, and became increasingly
enamored with W&L.

Yet, there was one problem. I
am Jewish and come from a fam-
ily that values a strong connec-
tion to the Jewish community.
My parents did not think that
W&L had a vibrant Jewish pres-
ence, and this perceived absence
was one of the reasons why my
folks pressured me to attend a
different undergraduate institu-
tion.

Nevertheless, I have been
extremely satisﬁed with my re-
ligious experiences here at W&L
and through the great work of
Hillel, I have become closer to
my faith. Additionally, by be-
ing in the minority, the Jewish
community on this campus is as
vibrant and strong as anywhere
else.

Last May, I graduated from
Brandeis University. Brandeis is
a Jewish-sponsored university in
Waltham, Mass., and the insti-
tution purports to promote the
principles of social justice and

progressivism.

Over 50 percent of the stu-
dents at Brandeis are Jewish,
the university closes for Jewish
holidays, and the institution has
close afﬁliations with many Jew-
ish causes. At Brandeis, one can
become really disillusioned with
one’s faith, as a Jewish presence
is omnipresent, and it is easy to
take this presence for granted.

are just fewer of us at W&L.
This has led us to proactively
seek out and spend time with
other Jewish students, and Hillel
helps facilitate this interaction.
The Hillel here is in a lot of
ways more effective at connect-
ing Jews with their religious tra-
ditions than Jewish organizations
at other colleges. At‘Brand,eis,
for instance, Shabbat dinners are

“I laugh now when I recall that some of

my ﬁriends and family members told me
before I came to W&L that I should not

wear a Star of David on campus, or do

anything to attract attention to my reli-

gious beliefs. _

_ 

One can become overwhelmed
by the Jewish atmosphere on
campus.

At W&L, Jews are in the mi-
nority, and this has positive ef-
fects on one’s Jewish experience.
The Jews here seem much more
closely bonded than those at
Brandeis, because frankly there

massive events that include hun-
dreds of people. Here, it is much
smaller affair, but this leads to a
generally much more personal
experience.

Shabbat dinner at W&L is
one of the most beautiful events
I have ever been to. Students
and faculty from W&L make

up most of the participants, but
many VMI cadets and local fam-
ilies are also in attendance. This
has the effect ofuniting the local
Jewish community, and allowing
all of us the opportunity to share
our traditions with other Jews in
the area.

I am so fond of this monthly
event and other experiences,
that I would advise any Jewish
people I know to attend this in-
stitution. Enrolling at W&L can
have the effect of drawing Jew-
ish youth closer to their faith,
and also allows one the opportu-
nity to become part of a unique
community.

Furthermore, the W&L ad-
ministration greatly supports
Jewish students. For instance,
the university strongly contrib-
uted to the construction of a
Hillel House, and this support is
one ofthe reasons I felt comfort-
able coming to W&L in the ﬁrst
place.

Additionally, a menorah was
displayed in the Commons liv-
ing room during the holidays,
and none of the greetings issued
by our university during that
season excluded Jews.

Furthermore, the institution
doesn’t seem to exclusively sup-
port any one faith, even though

Supreme Court decision to allow unlimited political donations is wrong

Court’s ruling last Thursday al-

Five of the nine Supreme

corporations, as “persons,” can
pump an inﬁnite amount of
money into our political system

porate interests.

The glaring irrationality be-

cision leaves me breathless. If
money equals speech_and more

“persons” with more money
have more speech. And doesn’t
that undermine the very princi-

ligious roots.

I would also like to note that
the W&L community (in my
case, more like the W&L Law
community) has really helped
me feel welcome here despite
my different religious beliefs.

Many of my colleagues at the
law school share Yiddish expres-
sions with me, while others c_ome
to Hillel-sponsored events. Yet
others seem genuinely interested
in Jewish traditions, and one of
my non—Jewish friends even had
a festive Chanukah patty com-
plete with latkes and donuts in
order to celebrate the holiday.

Furthermore, I have never
been discriminated against at
W&L, and have never felt dif-
ferent because of my religion.
I laugh now when I recall that
some of my friends and family
members told me before I came
to W&L that I should not wear a
Star of David on campus, or do
anything to attract attention to
my religious beliefs.

This advice seems almost
comical to me now, as my expe-
rience here has perhaps had the
effect of making me more proud
of my ethnic and religious back-
ground.

I therefore express my Jewish

identity more at W&L than I have
at any other point in my life, as
the community here seems en-
tirely supportive and welcoming
of my religious beliefs.

Overall, I have had a fantastic
religious experience so far here
at W&L. Primarily, this is due to
the hardworking people at W&L
Hillel, who have created a wide
range of programs which bond '
Jewish students together and
draw us all closer to our faith.

But also, I have had such a
great experience thus far due to
the nature of W&L‘s welcoming
community. People here have
been wonderful, and due to this
support, I have had a fantastic
religious experience as a student
here at W&L.

Elections shows Senator Brown is a true “game changer”

The result of last weeks Massachusetts senatorial election means no Democrat in any seat is safe this year

By Jarett Brotzman
COLU MNIST

Last Tuesday, underdog Re-
publican Scott Brown was elect-
ed to the Senate seat formally
held by Senator Ted Kennedy.
The ﬁrst Republican to be _elect-
ed a senator from Massachusetts
since 1972, Brown’s election sent
out the message by Massachu-
setts that “We want change, but
not the kind of change that Presi-
dent Obama is pushing for.”

These results are certainly
dramatic. In November 2008,’
Obama took Massachusetts with
a 26-point lead over John Mc-
Cain. On Jan. 19, Martha Coke-
ly, endorsed by Obama, lost by
around 5-points. If the election is
any measure of the popularity of
President Obama and his agenda,
the 31-point shift is something
to be concerned about for the
Democrats.

But beyond the numbers of
the election, what does the elec-
tion of Senator Brown in Ted
Kennedy’s seat really mean‘?

A lot.

Initially, this election will
have a dramatic effect on the per-

ceived prospects of candidates
for November, both Republican
and Democrat.

On the Republican side, can-
didates and supporters will have
a renewed interest in elections
that perhaps seemed unobtain-
able just a month earlier. There
will be an increased interest of

energized base than in the elec-

For Democrats, the potential
cost of running for ofﬁce just

like a permanent shift towardsthe

in 2008, is now recognized as a

temporary shift by the growing
and ever-ﬁckle independent vot-
ers. Incumbent Democrats, po-
tentially facing for the ﬁrst time
a viable Republican challenger,
might decide that retirement and
the beach houses that are waiting

for them seem pretty appealing
right now. _

It also seems that the Mas-
sachusetts election of Senator
Brown is a certain rejection of
many policies pursued by the
Obama administration. Senator
Brown has been quoted as say-
ing:

“I ’ve criticized President Bush
for his failure to use his veto pen.
There’s plenty of blame to go
around. The question is how to
solve problems. lt’s not bailouts.
What made America great? Free
markets, free enterprise, manu-
facturing, job creation. That’s
how we’re gonna do it, not by
enlarging government.” (WSJ,
Jan. 22)

Senator Brown seems to be
rejecting both the large growth
of debt and government by both
President Bush and Obama. In
Washington, this will take the
form of opposition to “Obam-
aCare,” card checks for unions
and the cap-and-trade energy tax
in its current form. While some
of this opposition is ideological,

such as his position on “Obam-
aCare,” Brown seems to oppose
large increases in spending from
wherever they come from.

But Brown, a liberal Republi-
can by most measures and a self-
described “Scott Brown Repub-

lican,” is not opposed to all of

President Obama’s policies and
seeks to be a consensus builder,
not ideological roadblock.

He agrees that the situation
inherited by the Obama White
House is far from ideal, and

believes that President Obama

has taken the advice of General
McCrystal- in Afghanistan and is
doing a “great job” with North
Korea.

Another potential area of con-
sensus between the Obama Ad-
ministration and Senator Brown
could be new initiatives in edu-
cational policy promoting char-
ter schools and merit-based pay.

The implications of this elec-
tion are tough to measure so soon
afterward, but the long-term ef-
fects on Senator Brown’s elec-
tion will certainly go beyond the

 

ability to ﬁlibuster.

Brown seems to ﬁt the type of
workhorse politician—one who
will make the best of a situation
and not fall victim to political
overreach in light of the recent
victory.

But the real lesson from last
Tuesday is that if a Republican
can take Ted Kennedy’s Sen-
ate seat in Massachusetts, no
Democrat in any seat across the

country is safe from Republican '

assault in November.

Rape stories get the message across

Kruse argues for necessity and effectiveness of sharing assault accounts

Dear Anonymous Phi Writer,

I have to say that I disagree
with your assertion that last se-
mesfer’s postings of rape stories
in,the Phi and around campus
were ineffectual and were not
needed in such prevalence.

It is important ﬁrst to rec-
ognize the signiﬁcance of the
articles, which were submitted
by survivors of rape on W&L’s
campus to show that rape and
sexual assault do in fact happen
on campus more often than we
would like to realize.

They were necessary in prev-
alence ﬁrst to show the gravity of
the situation, but also because it
is hard to get a message across
comprehensively when people
tend not to read Campus Notices
or pay that much attention to
other reminders or postings on
billboards.

I think that your argument
that the “frequent and graphic”
stories around campus (not just
in the men’s bathrooms, as you
seem to imply) leading to only
talking about the frequent and
graphic stories shows not that the
stories are wrong, but that people
on campus are too apathetic to
actually be concerned with the
issue.

It is much easier to argue
about the validity of the stories
and write about why you think
that End It has misled the cam-

pus than how terrible it is that
these stories and many others
have occurred on our “campus of
honor”

I am tired of people saying
that “sexual assault is a problem,
but...” and then stating what
the group trying to stop it has
done wrong, rather than what
the writer personally could do to

If people do not want action
from the problems that you your-
self stated are very real, then
that shows campus apathy, but
it doesn’t show that End It was

,,_wrong in posting those stories.

 I recognize that there is a
need for more “gentle” activism
on campus, but I disagree with
the idea that strategies like the

Rape doesn ’t happen

in public, on Trav-

eller or on the dance ﬂoor, and... if your

friends or other guys

have committed a

rape, they arenot going to say, “oh yeah,

that was me. ” ‘

stop sexual assault on a personal
level.

On that note, of course not all
W&L men are rapists. However,
some men are and they are frater-
nity brothers or fellow students
or people who are supposed to
believe in a system of respect.

I would also like to note that
rape doesn’t happen in public, on
Traveller or on the dance ﬂoor,
and that if your friends or other
guys have committed a rape,
they are not going to say, “oh
yeah, that was me.”

Red Flag Campaign are the way
to go.

The problem with the Red
Flag Campaign, organizations
like SPEAK and I in 4, or any
other strategy that we have tried
on campus is the fact that they
have been tried and that sexual
assault rates have not gone down
yet.

This data is reflected inour
rotating CORE and NCHA data,
both of which are reliable, non-
biased surveys not speciﬁcally
based on sexual assault or other

“leading” topics (which some
have argued could account for
the high statistics).

Furthermore, Red Flag Cam-
paign posters might be showing
appropriate situations that you
mentioned, but they are removed
in that people don’t really con-
nect them to their own lives, not
to mention the fact that every
year, we still have over twice
the national average of reported
sexual assaults for both women
and men.

I have never heard anyone
discuss them as you have al-
leged, but I have seen plenty of
people laugh at them because of
the somewhat cliche instances
given. I think that W&L women
sharing their W&L stories makes
the campaign very personal in a
way that another organization’s
poster cannot.

Maybe instead of denying the
reality, you could be struck with
the pain that at least one student
had to go through and dedicate
yourself to stopping the occur-
rence from happening to any
woman on campus.

Sincerely,
Catherine Kruse

Dean of Students responds to article that mistakenly claimed the administration

did not have a plan to help stranded students after December is snowstorm

Dear Editor,

I write in response to the
Jan. 18 article, “Stranded in the
snow.” I write to clarify some in-
formation in the piece

In the beginning of the sec-
ond paragraph, the article reads:
“The University did not have
any plan to deal with the situa-
tion.”

The article goes on to ex-
plain the communication before
and during the storm, how the
sidewalks were maintained and
roads re-opened as quickly as
possible and how dining was re-
opened.

' All of those steps are a part
of Emergency Management
Plan that was actualized during
the storm. In addition, there was
reference made to a lack of food
for a few days.

In fact, on Saturday, students
were sent a communication

about restaurants open within

while we re-opened dining by
Sunday morning. Re-opening

 W&L senior publishes online novel

Abel Delgado is coming-of-age story about a young Cuban—American girl in Miami is now available for download

By Katie Boe
STAFF WRITER

V 0 t hestg

 

  

Not many college students can
boast completing a novel before
graduation, but Washington and
Lee senior Abel Delgado can. On
top of preparations to either attend
law school next year or work for
a non-govemmental organization,
Delgado has successfully written
a genuine and heartfelt coming-of-
age story featuring a 14 year-old
girl as the protagonist.

His novel, “Other Half,” is
available on the Internet and has
received more than a thousand
downloads.

The novel addresses the typical
issues that adolescents and young

adults have long struggled with.

The protagonist, Alethia, does
not believe in love and through a
creative writing assignment learns
to appreciate and believe in the
power of love. In her assignment,
she tells the story of her family
friends, Angel and Crystal, and
how they fell in love more than
ten years ago.

The book looks promising a"'‘ *

is certainly a “feel-good,” quick
read. It seems to appeal to a slight-
ly younger set than college-:.ge,
and would probably be catego-
rized as a young-adult novel.

Nonetheless, “Other Half’ is
a cute story that allows the reader
to connect" and empathize with the
characters.

and analyzing people, their per-
sonalities and the relationships
they have with each other.”
Delgado took much of his
plot from his own experiences in
high_school, and simply exagger-
ated them to embellish the story.
Even more, a signiﬁcant portion
of the novel’s dialogue “come[s]
directly from conversations I had

. with people back then,” Delgado

explained.

process any less difficult. Del-
gado experienced writer’s block
at times, but to combat it he never
forced himself to write. He also
found that he wrote best and most
ﬂuidly late at night, around mid-
night. By writing the novel in this
manner, he found that a lot of the
book wrote itself.

Finally, last summer, Delgado

was conﬁdent and pleased enough
with his work that he released the

“Other Half” is a cute story that allows the

reader to connect and

This first draft was titled
“Firsts,” but was completely re-
written a year later. Since the
primary re-writing, Delgado has
done more re-writes, additions
and edits until his work became
what it is now. Delgado said that
“re-writing was probably the most
difficult part.”

He also struggled with writing
from the perspective of a female
protagonist. To accurately and
genuinely create a female voice,
Delgado asked many of his female

novel to the public via the Internet.
Once the book hits between 5,000
to 10,000 downloads, and Del-
gado has received more feedback,
he will pursue literary agents and
publishers.

Should his first novel be pub-
lished, Delgado plans to write four
more novels as a series. While he
has not started to formally write
the next book in his series, he has
outlined and planned the next in-
stallment.

aking dance to the Twitterverse

The W&L Repertory Dance Company is technology-themed show uses micro—blogging to reach audience

By Stephanie Hardiman
ARTS & LIFE emroa

There aren’t many ‘times
that it’s okay to use your phone
during a performance. But the
Washington and Lee Repertory
Dance Company aims to change
that-.

For this year’s dance perfor-
mance, debuting on Thursday
night, audience members can
follow the show on Twitter to
get updates about the choreog-
raphers, dancers and the pieces
they perform.

“A lot of times, the dance
audience feels excluded,” said
Jenefer Davies, the company’s
artistic director. “They have to
ﬁgure out what’s going on. It’s
my attempt to create a more in-
clusive environment.”

Davies said that dance is
naturally very abstract and lends
itself to further explanation.
Tweeting to the audience will
help them engage in a new way,
she hopes.

Junior David Doobin will
be in the audience tweeting
via @WLUdanceconcert. Da-
vies hopes the audience will be
watching the show and getting
the inside scoop on the behind-
the-scenes information from
Twitter.

But Twitter is just the begin-
ning of what emerged as a tech-
nology-themed show.

Guest choreographer Bill
Meadows created a dance using
Nintendo’s Wii game console
remotes.

The “Wiimotes” are pro-
grammed to interface with a
special computer that creates
sounds depending on the danc-
ers’ movements. Dancers will
carry or wear the Wiimotes “to

create their own accompani-

ment,” Davies said.

Kevin Remington, W&L’s
photographer, is even involved
with a piece. A photo shoot of
dancers participating in an un-
derwater wedding will be pro-
jected on a giant screen while
senior Sophie Xiong improvises

to call it); “Califomia English”
is quick and clever, with only a

Arctic Monkeys, among oth-

The dances run the style
gamut—from hip-hop and ballet
to aerial and native Indian-in-

Only six of the company’s
members are dance minors, and
the others were selected through
an audition process at the begin-

The Watson Twins came to
indie rock prominence by sing-

later, they released Fire Songs,
a solid collection of folk—pop
numbers. For those familiar with
either of those two records, the
classic soul and R&B that the’
duo incorporates on Talking to

like a sea change.

But, though the style is differ-

“Sweetheart of the Rodeo”) and
quieter, more intricate folksy
numbers (“Money in the Bank,”
“Wandering Eye,” “Little Miss

Oddly, the ﬁrst single from
Sweet Heart Rodeo is “Ro-

Generals win one, lose one on the road

Men s basketball took a close victory over Methodist University, but couldn ’t rally to beat Hampden-Sydney; now 10-6 '

By Hank Nathan
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee men’s bas-
ketball team split its road games this
past week with a 59-53 win against
Methodist University and a 73-66 loss
to Hampden-Sydney College, resulting
in a 10-6 overall record.

The Generals opened the week with
a 59-53 win over Methodist on Wednes-
day. W&L started out fast to a 7-0 lead
capped by a three-pointer by senior for-
ward Zac White. The team continued to
build its lead on a dunk by senior for-

‘ ward Ben Goetsch who scored on a fast

break off of an assist by junior guard
Jason Cimino.

This play made the score 17-6 with
7:52 remaining in the ﬁrst half. The
Monarchs made a small dent in the Gen-
erals’ lead before the end of the half, and
the score was 23-16 at the break.

W&L came out on ﬁre in the second
frame and continued to build their lead.
In the ﬁrst six minutes of the second
half, the Generals went on a 14-4 run to
create a 37-20 lead.

During the run, senior forward An-
drew Payne added in seven points, in-
cluding an and-one layup. The squad’s
biggest lead in the game was 18 on two
foul shots by Payne with 9:48 to go in
the contest.

However, the Monarchs were unde-
terred by the large margin and began to
chip away at the Generals’ lead.

Following the 48-30 score, Method-
ist went on an 18-4 run and cut the lead
down to four points at 52-48 with 1:21
remaining. Despite only scoring from
the ﬁeld once in the last 11:17 of the
contest, W&L managed to convert on

“We didn’t have a ﬁeld goal in the last
11 minutes, but we didn’t panic.”

Also in the effort, Goetsch and Payne
combined for 21 points, while Cimino
tallied nine points, six boards and four
assists.

The game against Methodist marked
the ﬁnal out-of-conference game for
W&L this season. The squad will now

15 of its 20 free throws to seal a victory
at 59-53.

In the face of a comeback attempt by
the Monarchs, the Generals kept their
composure in the waning moments of
the game, said White.

“I think we reacted with poise down
the stretch,” said White who tied a
game-high in scoring with 13 points.

face 10 straight conference games.
Now that every game is in the Old
Dominion Athletic Conference, games
will become more intense, said Cimino.
“Conference games are a grind,”
said Cimino. “It seems like every game
in the ODAC comes down to one of the
ﬁnal possessions. The key to winning
conference games is focus. Every play

could be the one that wins or loses the
game, and I think we are ﬁnally starting
to ﬁgure that out heading into the home-
stretch of the season.”

Unfortunately, momentum was short-
lived after the victory against Methodist,
as W&L lost 73-66 to Hampden-Sydney
on Saturday.

The game was back-and-forth in
the ﬁrst half andlneither team had a
lead greater than seven points. Goetsch
opened up the scoring for the Generals
with a dunk on a backdoor feed by ﬁrst-
year Taylor Gilﬁllan. He then followed
that with a three-pointer .from the top of
the arc.

Additionally, ﬁrst-year Kelton Bu-
chanan provided two three-pointers off
the bench, but W&L still trailed 29-34
at half.

At the beginning of the second half,
Hampden-Sydney came out of the gate
fast and went on a 23-10 run to build
a 57-39 advantage. The Generals im-
mediately countered with a 10-0 run of
their own and slashed the lead to eight
with 7:53 to play. W&L continued to cut
into the Tigers’ lead on a shot from be-
yond the arc by White, a driving shot by
Cimino and a layup by ﬁrst-year JD Ey.

The Generals cut the score to 60-62

in favor of Hampden-Sydney with 3:35
remaining. However, the 2-point margin
was as close as the Generals would get,
as they fell 66-73.

In the contest, White led W&L in
scoring with 15 points, and added in ﬁve
rebounds. Goetsch and Payne combined
for 23 points, and Ey scored seven off
the bench.

Approaching the halfway point in
the season, the W&L men’s basketball
team will focus turning tough losses to
schools like Hampden Sydney into vic-
tories.

“There is always room for improve-
ment,” said Cimino. “We need to play
harder and be more focused. If you look
at our record and even stretches during
games, the lack of effort and focus have
hurt us. We are starting to improve that,
and are becoming more dangerous ev-
ery game.”

Double dual, double victories for swimming

ton, D.C. this Saturday. The squads both
earned double victories over Catholic
and Marymount Universities this week-
end.

The victories improved the men to 8-
3 for the season and brought the women
to a 6-4 overall record.

“[It was good] for both the men’s
and the women’s teams to see where
we are going in to conferences,” sopho-
more Katie Salvati said. “Some people

On the men’s side, the double-dual
meet turned into more of an intra-squad
competition as W&L posted sweeping
victories across the board.

“This meet was a chance for us to
push ourselves when we didn’t neces-
sarily have the competition from other
teams,” said senior Brandon Bamds.
“We had to make ourselves rise to the
occasion and try to go fast even when
we didn’t have anyone to compete

against beside ourselves...The fact that
we can still work hard and post some
good times is good to see.”

The Generals were lead by seniors
Ian Childers and Nick Talluri. Talluri
dominated the freestyle events, taking
home ﬁrst place in both the 50 freestyle
(22.12) and the 100 freestyle (48.87).
Childers ﬁnished ﬁrst in the 100 breast
(1104.20) and the 200 breast (2:l9.26)
and also played a key role in the team’s
victoryin the 200 medley relay.

Other relay team members includ-
ed senior Josh Gonzalez, Bamds and
sophomore Chris Washnock. The team
touched in ﬁrst with a time of 1:41.24.

The relay win “was really pretty cool
because our coach split up the relays so
we’d all be fairly even and all have. a
chance to win,” said Bamds, who swam
the ﬁnal freestyle leg in the relay. “The
last leg, all of the freestylers...were all
about even so I was just a tiny bit ahead,
by like a tenth of a second.”

Washnock also earned top honors in
two individual events. He placed ﬁrst in
the 100 back (56.05) and the 200 back
(2:01.10). Gonzalez also posted a time

of 2:00.71 in the 200 fly, good enough
to earn him an individual medal of his
own.

W&L also led the way in the 400
freestyle relay with a ﬁrst-place ﬁnish
of 3:26.96. Senior Jonathan Giesen an-
chored the relay, backed by sophomore
Jeff Stirling, senior Kevin Com and
sophomore Ryan Hartman.

Giesen also placed ﬁrst in the 100 fly
with a time of 55.42.

On the women’s side, the team’s
ﬁrst-years stepped up big, racking in
four titles between them to bring their
team a victory.

“I feel like, since we have a really
young team, it took us a while to get
freshmen adjusted,” Salvati said. “But
as the'season has progressed they’ve
started to become a bigger part of our
team.” ‘

First-year .Ann McCampbell led
the Generals in long distance swim-
ming with a victory in the 1650 free at
18:55.71.

McCampbell has dominated distance
events for the Generals this year, ﬁll-
ing a void in what used to be one ofthe

women’s weaker events, Salvati said.
“It’s nice to be able to step up and

help the team where maybe we were

lacking before,” McCampbell said.

F irst-year Brittany Ross held the 200 '

ﬂy with a time of 2:18.18, and fellow
ﬁrst-year Delaney Rolfe notched a win
in the 500 free with a time of 5:30.71.

Rolfe was also a member of the wom-
en’s winning 200 medley relay team
which ﬁnished with a time of 1:56.97.
Rolfe was helped by teammates senior
Sarah Simpson,junior Tess Hayden, and
senior Lynn Bazzel.

Simpson was in top form for the Gen-
erals that day, turning in two individual
victories to go with the relay win. She
placed ﬁrst in the 100 freestyle with a
time of 56.42 and the 200 freestyle with
a time of2:03.l3. _

The teams will be back in the pool
next Saturday for a home meet against
Johns Hopkins. The meet kicks off at 11
a.m.

When a field goal isn’t just threepoints

Kickers had a dismal showing in the ﬁrst two rounds of the NFL playoﬂs and handed their teams disappointing losses

By Adam Cancryn
STAFF WRITER

With four minutes left in the divi-
sional round game between the Jets and
Chargers, CBS cut to a close-up shot of
San Diego kicker Nate Kaeding.

Alone on the sideline, his expression
one of shock and confusion, he looked
as if he’d rather be anywhere than on
that ﬁeld.

Given the chance, Chargers fans
likely would’ve granted him his wish.

Kaeding had just ﬁnished shank-
ing his third ﬁeld goal of the game,
a 40-yarder pushed just right of the
posts. Though San Diego notched a
touchdown on its next drive, it was not
enough. They would lose by three, and
Kaeding, the Pro Bowler who hit 91.4
percent of his regular season kicksgand

zero percent when it mattered, was the

scapegoat.

While he might have felt alone on
the sideline, Kaeding is just one of a
procession of kickers whose postseason
incompetence has doomed their respec-
tive teams.

Through the ﬁrst two rounds of the
NFL playoffs, placekickers on losing
teams made just three of their 13 ﬁeld
goal attempts. That comes out to a con-
version rate of just 23 percent.

Compare that to a regular season that

saw kickers banging home threes at an
81 percent clip and something certainly
seems amiss. Even the Tampa Bay Buc-
caneers, saddled with the worst kicking
game in the league, managed to sneak
one through the uprights three times out
of ﬁve.

So why, during the most crucial time
of the year, won’t the ball just go to its
home?

It’s certainly not due to a lack of tal-
ent. Kickers on losing teams_combined
to hit 84 percent of their regular season
attempts. The Cardinals’ Neil Rackers.
led the league, converting 16 of his 17
kicks before bungling a potential game-
winner in the Wild Card round and miss-
ing another seven days later. Kaeding
missed just three all year before equal-
ing that number in one playoff game.

But the postseason takes place in the
dead of winter, where a simple shift in
wind direction can completely change a
game. Maybe the elements are to blame
for such ineptitude.

Unless these players were thrown off
by the immaculate conditions, not likely.
In the ﬁrst two rounds, three games were
played in domes and one was played in
San Diego. Not many blizzards to worry
about there.

No, as more numbers are crunched
and situations examined, there seems to
be no logical explanation for the sudden
onset of yips, yanks, shanks and ﬁubs
that have turned the game’s best kick-
ers into that guy from Section 247 they
bring down at halftime for a $1,000 try.

Attempts aren’t from any farther
away than normal. The average ﬁeld

Even more distressing is the role
this unusual trend has had in determin-
ing outcomes. The Cincinnati Bengals’
Shayne Graham missed twice against
New York, including a 28-yarder that
would have brought them within one
point with 3:49 left. Instead, the Jets
took over and ran out the clock.

Down 19 early in the fourth quar-

It is no coincidence that the four re-
maining teams going into championship
weekend were. perfect when trying for
three. The Jets, beneﬁciaries of a mi-
raculous chain of events that enabled
them to slip into the playoffs, continue
to thrive off of others’ mistakes. Oppos-
ing kickers are 0-5 against them through
two rounds.

Had Keading converted just one of his three chances, San Diego could have

potentially forced overtime and gone on to win. Instead, the offense sat helplessly

_ 

goal length for losing teams’ kickers is
44 yards. It’s no chip shot, but regular
season attempts from that distance were
successful three-quarters of the time.

Playoff pressure? Past history sug-
gests it has little effect, especially for a
group with 904 successful kicks under
their belt. In 2008, there were only six
misses in the entire playoffs. This year is
on pace to set the record for lowest ﬁeld
goal percentage since the NFL switched
to a 12-team playoff fonnat in 1990.

ter and trying to help his team claw its
way back, the New England Patriots’
Stephen Gostkowski pulled his attempt
wide right. They wouldn’t regain pos-
session until the two-minute warning,
leaving them far too little time to rally.
And had Kaeding converted just one
of his three chances, San Diego could
have potentially forced overtime and
gone on to win. Instead, the offense sat
helplessly as its opponent ran out the

clock. W

The staggering lack of efﬁciency
thus far is surely a small sample size, but
it carries with it serious implications. In
the Super Bowl, one team wins and one
loses. There is no next game, no second
chance. Just a ﬁnal score, one that is
often determined by the gangly, highly
specialized kicking machine standing

alone on the sideline, waiting for his“

shot.

Sophomore forward Becca Bolton,
who garnered ODAC Player of the Week
honors for her efforts last week, scored l9
points to go with her l2 rebounds.

Junior guard Allie Long netted 15
points and added six boards while junior
center Felice Herman stuffed the stat sheet
with 10 points, nine rebounds and four as-
sists.

Herman said she was pleased with the
team’s effort.

“We were not expecting them to be as
tough as they were,” she said. “They took
us out of our game plan in the ﬁrst half
defensively but I thought we rallied well
in the second. ‘We cannot make the same
mistakes.”

Although the Generals gained a win,
for a team with so much talent, there is
always room for improvement.

“All we can do is continue to work
hard in practice and improve every day,
every game,” Herman said.

On Saturday night, the team traveled to
Emory and Henry to face yet another con-
ference opponent. W&L’s stiﬁing defense
came out in full force this contest. Coach
Mandy King’s squad held the Wasps to a
mere 31 ﬁeld goal percentage, and pres-
sured the opponent into coughing up 21
turnovers. Seeing such strong defensive
numbers is usually a good thing, and that
proved true as the Generals dispatched the
Wasps by a score of 55-45.

The Generals trailed 19-16 with six
minutes left in the ﬁrst half, but did not
look back from there as they seized the
lead for good.

Bolton continued her torrid pace with
19 points and 12 rebounds, completing
her eighth double-double of the season.
Herman again complemented her with a
clutch l4-point, ll-board effort.

Bolton has arguably been the catalyst
ofthe team’s dominating play of late. She
is averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds
a game, good enough for ﬁfth-in-league
scoring and second-in-league rebounding.
Her eight double-doubles have often oc-
curred when it matters most, during key
conference matches.

Expectations continue to climb within
the program, Herman said.

“Our goals have remained the same:
win ODACS,” she said. “Now, it seems as

though we are deﬁnitely on our way. We _

had a very tough non-conference schedule
which gave us the conﬁdence we need in
ODAC play because no team can throw
something at us that we have not already
seen.”

The Generals’ next game is versus
Guilford College, next Friday at home.
