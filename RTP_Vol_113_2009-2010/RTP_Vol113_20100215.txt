In addition to the regional competition last week-
end, the team attended four tournaments during the
fall. They placed third at Richmond University and
second and ﬁfth at Duke, so (leading into regioiials,
team members were very_excited.

“We were conﬁdent that we had built two very
strong, competitive teams,” Budzinski said.

The results show that the team’s excitement was
warranted. They made a last minute change in their
case but it paid off with the ﬁrst and fourth place
ﬁnishes. In addition to the team’s success, freshman
Nate Reisinger received a best witness award for his
portrayal of the murder victim’s nerdy assistant.

The teams will spend the next month preparing
for the Opening Round Championship which will
take place on Mar. 26-28. Although the team obvi-
ously wants to succeed at the next level, Budzinski
says he will be proud of this team no matter what.

“As long as they give it their all, I really don’t
think winning or losing is the most important thing,”
Budzinski said.

Mock trial is a huge time commitment and mem-

bers often have to miss other events on campus.

The next round of competition conﬂicts with Fancy
Dress. But in spite of all the time required, members
really enjoy the experience.

“We have a lot of fun together, so it is deﬁnitely
worth missing some things,” ﬁrst year team member
Abbie Caudill said.

Caudill’s favorite part of being on the team is get-
ting to spend time with such a great group of people.
The friendships formed between team members are
also important to Budzinski.

“It’s really a great program- it brings together a
bunch of very smart, talented people who might not
otherwise socialize,” says Budzinski. “Every year,
we grow closer and support each other to the end, no
matter what. It’s really great.”

ters to Lexington,” the organization’s
executive director, Thomas G. Goo-
dale said. “Given that our l00th an-
niversary is in 2014, it is appropriate
to return to the ‘mother ship.’”

The move back to Lexington will
be a permanent one rather than the
temporary locations ODK has used
in the past.

“We spent many years at the
University of Kentucky and the last
few years at Transylvania Univer-
sity. This move will give us our ﬁrst
permanent home,” Barb Snyder, the
ofﬁce manager of ODK’s national
headquarters, said. This also marks
the ﬁrst time ODK will have a facility
of its own instead of renting facilities
owned by a college or university.

alism of ,George Washington

and Robert l-3. Lee. The history of
ODK celebrates these founders who
formulated the idea that leadership
of exceptional quality and versatil-
ity in college should be recognized
in all phases of university life. The

first public announcement ofthe es- ,

was made in this same newspaper,
the Ring Tum Phi, on January 12,
1915.

Almost immediately. the new so-
ciety received requests from groups
at other colleges interested in form-
ing their own circles of ODK. ln
1917, there were four circles of
ODK, and together they formed the
national society. Since its founding,
Omicron Delta Kappa has initiated
over 300,000 members, and on Mar.
12, 1974, the ODK National Conven-
tion convened in New Orleans and
approved the initiation of women.

In its mission statement, ODK
strongly emphasizes three key goals.
The first is to recognize those who
have attained a high standard of cf-
fectiveness in collegiate activities
and inspired others by their example.
The society also strives to gather stu-
dents from all phases of collegiate
life in order to “mould the senti-
ment of the institution on questions
of local and intercollegiate inter-

  

ests.” The last part of their purpose
involves bringing together members
of the faculty and student body on a
basis of mutual interest and under-
standing.

ODK alumni range from India-
napolis Colts quarterback Peyton
Manning to secretary of state Hill-
ary Clinton to singer/songwriter
Sheryl Crow. W&L alumni who are
members ofODK include former na-

late Supreme Court Justice Lewis

Large possibilities loom on the horizon for microfinance

Both at Washington and Lee and abroad, microﬁnance is developing into a feasible way of helping the third world

By Jarrett Brotzman
COLU M NIST

Around the world, billions of
people live in extreme poverty,
with approximately one in ﬁve
individuals living on less than

$l.25aday.
On an international scale,
large-scale poverty reduction

campaigns have yielded mixed
results. Since 2006, when Mu-
hammad Yunus received the
Nobel prize for his work with
the Grameen Bank and micro-
loan program, new attention has
been called to the emerging ﬁeld
of microﬁnance as a sustainable
and holistic approach to poverty
alleviation and reduction around
the world.

Microﬁnance, also called mi-
crolending or microloans, serves
to provide basic credit services
for impoverished entrepreneurs
around the globe. Concentrated
in developing or third world na-
tions, Micro Finance Institutions
(MFIS) serve to ﬁll the credit gap
to impoverished entrepreneurs.

Most of these loans are quite
small, ranging from $25 USD
to $150 USD, and used by indi-
viduals to purchase basic capital
equipment, expand their busi-
nesses, hire more workers and
provide clean water and electric-
ity to their families and commu-
nities.

Theory and practice have re-
vealed microﬁnance to be an ef-
fective method for engendering

erty alleviation. Underdeveloped
countries around the world are
receiving grassroots level cash
injections that ﬁnance entrepre-
neurs who do not otherwise have

alleviation, these loans are also
considered a very sustainable
form of aid as most proﬁts from
loan prepayments are recycled
through the communities where
the loans were originally made.
Since the root causes of ex-
treme poverty go deeper than

their environment and how to do
business in a way that beneﬁts
their families, their communities
and the welfare of their entire
country.

In addition to the beneﬁts to
these impoverished communi-.
ties that microﬁnance provides,

access to ﬁnancial capital.

As lack ofcredit and capital is
an evident problem for the poor,
access to capital through micro-
ﬁnance will give individuals the
opportunity to raise themselves
from poverty and develop sus-
tainable businesses that beneﬁt
the greater economy.

Repayment rates are quite
high for these microloans, rang-
ing from 90-99% non-delinquent
repayments for the vast majority

lack of capital; the poor must
have access to practical informa-
tion and skills in order to suc-
ceed.

Furthermore, poor health and
unexpected deaths from AIDS
and childbirth create loan de-
linquencies that undemiine the
microﬁnance model. This is why
most microﬁnance institutions

have programs to teach borrow- ’

ers how to protect themselves
from HIV/AIDS, how to protect

opportunities to institutional and
individual investors.

Deutsche Bank has estimated
that there is over a $250 billion
USD gap in micro ﬁnancing
available around the world, and
with only 13 million people be-
ing served by these loans, there
is an estimated 500 million more
potential customers to be served
(Source: Deutsche Bank, World
Vision).

A group of W&L students

have seen this ﬁnancing gap as
an opportunity to make an im-
pact on poverty around the world
and gain experience building,
running, and managing a multi-
faceted microﬁnance investment
group. Called the General De-
velopment Initiative, Inc. (GDI),
the group is initially focused
on making microloans to high
quality MFI’s around the world
through a group called Dvelo.
org.

Dvelo, cofounded by Wash-
ington and Lee alum Drew Mc-
Way, seeks to help fund MFI’s
while returning a portion of the
interest rate of the loan to inves-
tors. With a motto of “Do Well.
Do Good”, Dvelo is opening up-
the once-closed nature of micro-
ﬁnance.

The GDI seeks to also expand
the opportunities for students at
W&L inside and outside the
classroom. With the goal of a
new spring term class studying
the intricacies on microﬁnance
through on-the-ground ﬁeld-
work, managing a ever—growing
loan portfolio, and network-
ing through other colleges and
MFl’s, the GDI seeks to become
the premier college-afﬁliated
microﬁnance initiative.

The potential for microﬁ-

nance is large and ever growing.
Not only have these small loans
been shown to increase the qual-
ity of life and access to basic
credit services to impoverished
individuals around the world,
but microﬁnance is quickly be-
coming a new form of invest-
ment where individual investors
can both earn a quality ﬁnancial
and social retum.

To learn more about these
possibilities, get involved with
the General Development Ini-
tiative here at Washington and
Lee.

Jon Salm explains the absurdity of hype that surrounds Girl Talk, who played at the Pavilion last Friday night

By Jonathan Salm
COLU M N I ST

If you attended the same con-
cert as I did Friday night, you
probably had a great time danc-
ing and grooving to the deriva-
tive pop mash-ups of Girl Talk
(real name: Greg Gillis).

I had a great time, too. I’ve
been a fan of Girl Talk’s for
years, and Gillis’ mash-ups pro-
vide a near perfect soundtrack for
the current generation of teenag-
ers and young adults: a culture

' of easily distracted, Adderall de-

pendent pop culture addicts.

By seamlessly combining
tracks like The Notorious B.I.G"s
“Juicy" with Elton John’s “Tiny
Dancer” into brutally catchy
dance music, Girl Talk has
quickly become a pop culture
phenomenon.

Gillis created Girl Talk with
two albums of glitch-pop mash-
ups as a bored college student in
his Case Western Reserve dorm
room. .

After years of practice, Gillis’
two most recent albums are full
of his characteristically smooth

and danceableimash-ups featur-
ing pop music’s guiltiest plea-
sures.

However, after seeing Gillis
perform live for the ﬁrst time this
weekend, I cannot help but feel
betrayed by this so-called “con-
cert experience.”

Despite putting on an un-
doubtedly entertaining, thrilling
and mind—numbingly loud show,
I couldn’t help but question Gil-
lis’ performance.

It is not that Gillis puts on
an bad show; in fact, it is com-
pletely the contrary: the one
thing Gillis seems to succeed at
is having a good time and mak-
ing sure his audience does, too.
Everything else, though, reeks of
a sham, but nothing annoys me
more than Gillis’ claim of ‘‘I’m
Not a DJ.”

Gillis is as much of a per-
former as his music is original
— that is, not at all. lfl grew my
hair out, rocked a beard, put on
a bandanna and sweated my
balls of onstage, I could put on

‘the same sort of show that Gillis
did (I’m a great dancer and hype
man). ,
The technical aspect of speed-
ing up and slowing down tracks
and then aligning vocals with
beats and instrument tracks is an
essentially simple process.

ence is less of a concert and more
of a party.

Loud music, thrashing,
sweaty bodies, and an extremely
intoxicated crowd. The whole
experience could have very well-
been reciprocated on windfall or
at a_ polerhouse.

Despite putting on an undoubtedly

entertaining, thrilling and mind—numb-

ingly loud show, -I couldn ’t help but

question Gillis ’ performance.

As for playing live, Gillis
simply sequences together the
pre-created tracks, often recre-
ating some of the same exact
mash-ups found on his studio
albums.

After Friday, it seemed obvi-
ous that the Girl Talk live experi-

Gillis even invited the crowd
to the stage to party with him
(the lackluster performance and
energy of those students is an-
other story altogether).

I have ample knowledge and
experience of both concerts and
parties, and Gillis’ performance

was unquestionably more similar
to the latter. And atIsuch parties,
who decides which hot tracks to
play? That’s right, the DJ.

Upon examining‘ the DJ vs.
not a DJ argument, Gillis does
deserve some credit.

On one level, Gillis is right
— he is not in fact a DJ. He is as
much ofa DJ during his shows as
I am writing this essay. We both
use a computer to do our work,
although he seems to get, much
more excited about his.

As opposed to Gillis’ com-
puter-only performances, other
modern DJ’s use turntables,
synthesizers, mixers, drum ma-
chines, as well as computers. By
this logic, Gillis would be right
in asserting he is not a DJ.

On the other hand, I consider
him to be even less than a DJ.
Now thisjust seems cruel, reduc-
ing a critically acclaimed artist
(I use this term liberally) to the
level of a frat party DJ.

Gillis doesn’t deserve that.
His mash-ups are exciting dance

tracks, and there’s a reason he
gets paid inordinate amounts
of money to press buttons and
dance around in front of college
students. Under those param-
eters, there is absolutely no de-
nying that he is great at what he
does.

Therefore, there is no way
around it: Girl Talk IS A DJ.

Staying open in the snow is not a feat to be proud of

Student berates W&L administration for not closing the school sooner in the face of a dangerous snowstorm

To the editor:

‘Feb. 10, 2010. Another win-
try day. for the Washington &
Lee student to wake up, look
outside his window and see that
the roads and sidewalks are once
more covered in a thin sheet of
snow.

Perhaps one particular stu-
dent has recently sold an item on
eBay that he needs to ship, so he
gingerly travels from his home
in Davidson Park to the Lexing-
ton post oﬁice.

He almost slips on the ice
covered steps leading from his
house to the sidewalk, but he
regains his balance before he
twists an ankle or falls and lands
on his backpack, crushing the
laptop within. With the hosts
of his favorite podcast chatter-
ing away in his ears, he crosses
Nelson Street and heads west in
the direction of his beloved uni-
versity and the post otﬁce.

He arrives at the post office at

blue backpack ironically recites
the beginning ofthe USPS’s un-
ofﬁcial creed: “Neither snow nor
rain, huh?”

The student who has the

F0

sity, which he knows will not be
closed for the day.

Feb. 10 was the latest in a se-
ries of irresponsible and ignorant
decisions (or should I say, inde-
cisions) on the part of the admin-

istration here at W&L. As the
mid-Atlantic and northeastern
states are ravaged by a series of
snowstorms that simply will not
cease, W&L gleefully ignores
the multiple feet of snow and po-
tentially lethal sheets of ice and
demands that its faculty, students
and other employees continue to
carry on with classes and other
activities.

Friday, Feb. 5, was the most
egregious example of this irre-
sponsibility. On Thursday night,
universities and high schools
for miles around shut down in
recognition of and preparation
for the snowstorm which had a
100 percent chance of occurring,
according to accuweathercom
(or any other reputable weather
website).

Not W&L. Oh, no, the ad-
ministration decided to wait
until after 8:30 a.m. to declare
that classes after noon would be
canceled.

Small matter that the snow

continued to fall that day well
into the aftemoon and early eve-
ning.

Small matter that students
still had to travel to campus to
attend an ll:l5 class that they
dared not miss because a quiz
was scheduled.

There are only three possible
explanations for such foolish be-
havior: 1) the administration has
access to neither the Internet nor
basic television and so had no
idea of what was going on out-
side of their realm of existence,
2) the administration did have

access to these things and decid- '

ed that either every single weath-
er prediction was wrong or that
the snow and ice would not, in
fact, render roads and sidewalks
dangerous, or 3) the administra-
tion simply does not care about
the safety of its faculty, students
and other employees.

Lest the administration should
miss my point, let me state it very
clearly here: being the only insti-

tution (save for VMI) for miles
around to remain open in the
face of a 100 percent chance of
snow and ice is not something to
celebrate. “Look at us and how
brave we are” is not the appro-
priate sentiment. When even the
post ofﬁce is closed, it’s time to
close the doors for a day, W&L.

the alumni hosts allowed me to
reduce that by $400).

2. W&L students have not

fully-engaging spring term, and
think they’d rather just enjoy the
old spring term lifestyle in Lex.

3. The course looks like it’s
about race, and that makes stu-
dents uncomfortable, or pro-
foundly bored.

4. Students didn’t know what
their options were, so they picked
a course that looked like it would
satisfy some requirement.

Don’t worry, I’ll get over it.
I’m just curious — and I think
hearing from students about any
of the above four theories might
help the entire faculty under-

stand what level of engagement
we can expect from students this
spring term.

Learning to live and love the ‘B+’ lifestyle in college

Stockton Bullitt provides a happy, stress—free alternative to constantly killing yourself over getting that “A ”

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

When “A” students respond
to this article, they will inevita-
bly say, “You’re just jealous of

‘what you can’t have.” And you

know what, they’re partially
right. Without reading this ar-
ticle, I can safely say you have
already won.

Are they gone yet? Good.

Okay, while the “A” students
do serve to help the school look
better to outsiders, the rest of us
all know that we really aren’t too
jealous of them.

This irrational dislike for “A”
students stems from the fact that
there are two kinds of “A” stu-
dents: the blessed few who ﬁnd
success in anything they touch
and the unhappy majority ob-
sessed with success to the point
that they are willing to sacriﬁce
their happiness in favor of a
higher GPA.

No matter what the rest of
us do, we will never be like the
blessed few and most of us just
cannot seem to bring ourselves
to emulate the tiresome work
ethic of the unhappy majority of
“A” students.

So, how do the rest of us cope
with not ﬁnding the consistent
66A???

Do we spend all our days
copying those who have found
success‘?

Do we say screw it, buy a
Volkswagen van and give up on
life?

Well, let me introduce you
to the epiphany that is the “B+”
lifestyle.

Before I do however, 1 just
want to make clear; I am not
necessarily talking about grades
when I talk about “A” students
and the “B+” lifestyle.

You can basically attribute
grades to all facets of life. While
I am certainly not an “A” student
with respect to grades, I deﬁnite-
ly am when it comes to writing
insulting things about fratemi-
ties. I am B- dresser, B partier
and C- video gamer (I always
dual-wielded the machine guns
in “Halo” instead of sticking with
the Battle Riﬂe). It doesn’t really
matter to what facet of your life
you attribute this article because
it applies to all of them.

Anyways, the “B+” lifestyle
is a certain way of living that
stresses being good at some-
thing, but not too good at it.

The theory originated that
when I was in elementary and
middle school. “B+” was the ex-
act grade that 1 could get on a test
or paper that satisﬁed both of my
personal necessities: I didn’t have
to spend too much time working
for it and it was just good enough

to not let my parents give me the
disappointed look.

See, nobody can really blame
you for getting a “B+” on any-
thing because it says that you
could’ve done a lot worse and
evidently you simply just aren’t

is where my issue with “A” stu-
dents comes in.

When I was in 7th grade, I
ﬁnally made the “A” team in
CYO basketball. I killed myself
the summer before getting good
at basketball, just so I could be a

talented enough to do better.

Like a “B,” it’s in the medi-
um, but unlike a “B,” it has that
extra plus to make it a happy me-
dium.

Malcolm Gladwell, a writer
for the New Yorker, asserted that
you need 10,000 hours of prac-
tice to become truly masterful at
it. While that is true, unless you
are one of the gifted minority, I
counter that whatever you’re do-
ing most likely stops being fun
around hour 3,000 or so.

Furthermore, I would much
rather do 100 things for 100
hours, rather than stick with
that one thing for 10,000. This

Why LeBron James is the

king of basketball

Using a myriad of statistics and references, Zac Burke
analyzes why LeBron James is the best player in the NBA

_ By Zac Burke

COLUMNIST

There has been a long debate
about who is the best basketball
player in the world. For all in-
tensive purposes, the debate has
been restricted to two players-
LeBron James and Kobe Bryant.

I am writing this article to tell
you one thing: LeBron James is
the best player in the NBA and
there is no close second.

Let me start off by telling you
that if you do not enjoy watching
and following sports, you will
not enjoy this article. It is full of

use when saying that Kobe is
better than LeBron is that Kobe
has four rings to LeBron’s zero.
While this is true and is a valid
point, Kobe’s rings rarely oc-
curred because of him alone.

He won three straight from
2000-2002 and all three times
Shaquille O’Neal was the ﬁ-
nals MVP. Shaq now plays
with LeBron on the Cavaliers,
but instead of the 28.5 ppg and
12.4 rebounds Shaq averaged
from 1999-2002, Shaq now aver-

What all these statistics tell you is that

LeBron can carry his team essentially by

himself while Kobe needs other all—stars

around him to dominate. Kobe can be a

dominant scorer, but when he is the main

option, his team is simply not as good.‘

statistics and basketball speciﬁc
references.

With that disclaimer, I begin
my argument. LeBron is ﬁrst in
the NBA in points, sixth in as-
sists, l4th in assists and is top 40
in blocks and rebounds. In short,
he does everything a basketball
player is asked to do extremely
well.

His team, the Cleveland Cav-
aliers, have the best record in the
NBA with a starting lineup that is
laughable compared to other top
teams in the league.

Kobe Bryant, on the other
hand, has Pau Gasol, one of the
most talented big men in the
NBA; Andrew Bynum, widely
considered one of the best cen-
ters in the league; Ron Artest, a
four time member of the NBA’s
all defensive team and Lamar
Odom, one of the best sixth men
in the league.

LeBron averages more points,
rebounds, assists, blocks, steals,
shoots a higher percentage and
has led his team to a better re-
cord in roughly the same amount
of minutes (38.9 to 38.6) than
Kobe.

The main argument people

ages only 11.7 points and 6.9 re-
bounds per game. Clearly LeB-
ron is not dealing with the same
‘-‘Big Diesel” as Kobe was in the
early 2000’s.

LeBron won the MVP over
Kobe in the 2008-2009 season,
averaging 28.4 points, 7.2 as-
sists and 7.6 rebounds per game
and ranked among the top seven
small forwards in 12 of the 16
categories used in most statisti-
cal analysis. He has also trans-
formed the Cavaliers from one of
the perennial worst teams in the
league to the team with the best
average record in the NBA over
the past three years.

Many supporters of Kobe
Bryant say that they would take
Kobe over LeBron if they needed
a player to make one shot for the
win.

While it may seem that
Kobe always makes the shots in
crunch time, when one looks at
the “clutch stats” it appears that
LeBron is superior to Kobe. Ac-
cording to 82games.com LeBron
hit the most ﬁeld goals in the last
24 seconds of regulation to tie
or win a game of any player in
the NBA. Kobe hit only three

less shots than LeBron, but shot
a paltry 25% compared to LeB-
ron’s 34% on game winners.

In “crunch time” LeBron also
had six assists to Kobe’s one, 14
free throws to Kobe’s 12 and four
turnovers to Kobe’s ﬁve.

There is essentially no statistic
that can be used to describe Kobe
as a better basketball player this
season than LeBron. An ESPN
columnist named John Hollinger
uses a statistic called Player Ef-
ﬁciency Rating, or PER, to rank
basketball players using FG%,
FT% points, rebounds and assists
per 40 minutes, turnovers, usage
rate and rebounding rate all com-
bined into a single number.

LeBron’s player efﬁciency
rating last season was a 31.76,
the third best ever and the best
of any player not named Michael
Jordan. This season, LeBron’s
PER is a 31.64 which is the
fourth best PER posted all time.
Kobe is currently posting a lowly
23.14 and his best PER ever was
a 28.11 that he posted in 2005-
2006 when the Lakers lost in the
ﬁrst round of the playoffs.

What all these statistics tell
you is that LeBron can carry his
team essentially by himselfwhile
Kobe needs other all-stars around
him to dominate. Kobe can be a
dominant scorer, but when he is
the main option, his team is sim-
ply not as good. -

Without LeBron the Cavaliers
would likely have a lottery pick
in next year’s draft while Kobe’s
Lakers would be a middle of the
road team in the Western Confer-
ence.

LeBron carries his team in
a multitude of ways while Kobe
acts as the best player on a great
team.

If they both retired today,
Kobe would leave with a better
legacy, but right now LeBron
James could likely carry any
team deep into the NBA playoffs
and will only get better as his ca-
reer progresses, which is why he
is the best player in the NBA and
likely will be for years to come.

part of the “A” team. But when I
did, I found that I didn’t get any
playing time and I didn’t really
even know that many people on
the team. I was miserable and
couldn’t wait until I was back on
the “B” team, where I could get
quality playing time and once
again be the big ﬁsh in a small
pond. This was the ﬁrst time I
found out that the “B+” lifestyle
was much better than the “A-”
lifestyle.

Does this make me a slacker
and kind of a sissy? Yeah, but
that doesn’t stop the fact that
I had a much better time being
both a slacker and a sissy.

I found

A If you haven’t scoffed at this
thesis yet, there are two icons of
the “B+” lifestyle that you can
work on emulating: Gucci Mane
and Nate Robinson.

Atlanta based rapper Gucci
Mane hardly puts any effort into
his rhymes. He does not use Nas’
description, Cam’ron double en-
tendres, or Drake’s one liners.
Instead, he just chooses good
beats and talks about what he
likes (drugs, women and any-
thing yellow).

That being said, he has still
incredible success de-
spite jail time and has probably
the best song of the moment in
“Lemonade.” Gucci Mane’s

focus on enjoying the moment_

rather than putting in effort has
led him to personal success. ‘

New York Knicks point guard
Nate Robinson puts the same
kind of effort in developing his
basketball game as Gucci Mane
puts into his lyrics.

Robinson is notorious for
lackadaisically running around
Madison Square Garden looking
for his. Furthermore, he used
absolutely no imagination in his
defense of his Slam Dunk title
this past weekend. He was able
to win because everyone else in
the ﬁeld was so dreadfully atro-
cious at dunking that Zac White

seriously considered ﬂying down
to Dallas and showing the NBA
how to throw down.

However, despite his porous
effort, Nate the Great used his

talent to be just good enough to _

win yet another Slam Dunk title.
He knew that giving a “A” effort
would’ve been nice, but he had a
lot more fun taking the easy road
to success.

So what am I trying to tell
you in this article? I am not tell-
ing you to give a half-ass eﬁ"ort
at life.

But what I am saying is that
you should focus on the smaller,
more achievable successes in life
and go for those.

It’s not worth it to waste all of
your time worrying about what
the “A” students are doing with
their lives because they either
are predisposed to beating you
or they are simply going to care
about the goal a little more than
you do.

Instead, settle for just being
“good enough” and enjoy the
day. Well, once the snow melts
that is.

East Asian food, fashion and fans  

Students ring in the Lunar New Year with performances, fashion show and an array of food in the Commons I ‘.

By Findley Merritt
STAFF WRITER

For many, the Red House
is often forgotten on the front
comer of Washington and Lee’s
campus.

But this past week, the Lunar
New Year Celebration brought
the department of East Asian
languages and literature to the
forefront.

The department, in tandem
with the Pan-Asian Association
for Cultural Exchange (PAACE),
sponsored two events to celebrate
the Chinese New Year of the
Tiger.

The Marketplace cooked up
a Lunar New Year dinner on
Wednesday.

Red paper lanterns, table cloths
and paper dragons adorned the
dining hall while students were
greeted by two blow-up Chinese
soldiers at the entrance.

For dinner, the dining staff
served shrimp, rice, stir fry, sweet
and sour chicken and green tea ice
cream for dessert.

There was even a sushi station
with California rolls.

Then on Thursday, students
of East Asian languages and
members of PAACE and the
Student Association for Intema-
tional Learning (SAIL) put on a
performance in the Commons to
celebrate the New Year.

The performance pieces ranged
from Chinese and Japanese poetry
recitations to karaoke and a mar-
tial arts performance.

Senior Sophie Xiong and

junior Kara Karcher performed a
traditional Chinese danc,e com-
plete with fans, in front a slide
show about the third-year Chinese
language students’ adventures in
China.

The performance ended with a
PAACE fashion show showcasing
different styles from Burma, Chi-
na, Korea, Japan and Vietnam.

In the fashion show, female
Chinese language students wore
Qipaos, which they explained
were traditional dresses worn to
parties or formal gatherings in
China.

Viewers ate Chinese food at
the conclusion of the performance
while they reflected on the chang-
ing year.

I The Chinese Lunar New Year
falls on a different date each
year and goes through a cycle of
animals that pertain to a speciﬁc
year. It fell on Valentine’s Day
this year.

Professor Hongchu Fu, chair
of the East Asian languages and
literature department, explained
that the tiger symbolizes luck in
Chinese cultures.

He said that Chinese emperors
always associated themselves
with the tiger, and it became a
symbol of reverence and good
fortune. ‘

“Hopefully this lucky year will
drive away the snow,” Fu joked.

Senior Danielle Ausems also
explained more about the Chi-
nese Zodiac in relation to the

Story of love, loss
and geometry

Randi Wilson sums up the German’
departments passionate weekend
performance of “Don Juan ”

By Randi Wilson
s TA F F w R IT E R

They say that 90 percent of
communication is nonverbal.

But I certainly didn’t under-
stand 90 percent of this weekend’s
German play, “Don Juan.” Opting
not to read the English synopsis,
I chose to just watch the play to
see what I could comprehend with
zero German background.

My story went something like
this. There’s a man named Don

Over the next 13 years, Juan
becomes an old-world playboy (in
typical Don Juan fashion), steal-
ing wives and killing their jealous
husbands in self-defense. In the
end, he marries one of the many
women that he has been involved
with, a prostitute enamored with
him, just so he can live in peace
and practice his geometry.

has mixed feelings about women.
He’s involved in a complicated
love triangle, in which one of
the women eventually commits
suicide. He gets in a ﬁght with
another suitor, and after much
sword waving, swiftly kills his

opponent for love. He marries his .

second lover.
I thought it made sense.

After the play concluded, I ﬁ- .

nally read the synopsis to clear up
what I thought were a few minor
issues. What I found was that I
had been close on some points,
and way off on others.

Don Juan is a story of pas-
sion, but not a typical one. He
has found true love in geometry,
a discipline so pure that “eternity
can be envisioned in two parallel
lines.” As a soldier in the Battle
of Cordoba, he performed a he-
roic act, which promised him the
hand of Don Gonzalo’s (a fellow
knight in that battle) daughter
in marriage. The daughter was
the only woman he ever loved,
but she killed herself when he
refused to marry her. Her father
attempted to salvage her honor
in a duel with Don Juan, but he
died after impaling himself on
Don Juan’s sword.

to understand to the fantastic job
the German students did with the
play. There was a great deal of
dialogue, which is impressive to
master in any language, let alone
a second one.

The choice of play, while a
bit different for its fascination
with a math subject, was ﬁlled
with drama and interesting story
turns. I kept wondering what was
going on while the audience, most
of them following along in their
English programs, kept wonder-
ing what would happen next.

But to all potential German
majors, know this: the German
department requires involvement
in this play rather than a senior
thesis. '

Junior Hannah Muther, who
played the part of the prostitute
“Celestina,” is a German and
politics double major. She asks
what’s better, “writing a giant
paper versus dressing up in crazy
costumes?” The choice was clear
for her.

And if a play with geometry
as a central character makes you
uneasily reminiscent of your ninth
grade math class, just remember
that women love an intellectual.

She said that the armual cycle
of animals represents the race to
reach Buddha.

The order in which they ap-
pear is believed to be the order in
which they reached Buddha.

ments: earth, metal, wood, water
and ﬁre.

ally with each element once and
creates the 60-year‘ cycle of the

She added that the tiger also
represents passion, so many of
the songs that the students sang
were about love.

Sophomore Chinese language
student Tyler Grant really enjoyed
participating in the program.

He explained that there are few
East Asian language majors, so he
was impressed with the number
of students who came to see the
performance.

Grant said that learning Chi-
nese is extremely difficult, and
students must have the necessary
time to devote to studying the
language.

But because the number of stu-
dents is small, they all feel like a
family headed by Professor Fu,

“Professor Fu is full of love,”
concluded Grant.

dances and poetry, and those who attended could sample East Asian foods.

73-56 last week.

Last Tuesday, the Gennies (13-8,
12-5 ODAC) welcomed E&H to the
winter wonderland of Lexington. One

gave E&H wonderful directions for the
drive home.

The Generals jumped out to an 8-0
lead and led by 46-18 at the half. That
margin proved insurmountable. W&L

mastered both ends of the court, shoot-
ing 51 percent from the ﬁeld while hold-
ing E&H to only 28 percent shooting.
While the Wasps were busy rattling
their shots off the iron, the Generals had
no problem ﬁnding the net. For the first
time since 1998, six players tallied dou-
ble-digit point totals in a game.

First-year forward Rachel Warrick
led the onslaught with 16 points. First-
year guard Katy Wilson was right be-
hind with 14. Sophomores Kari Ann
Pfannenstein, Meg Ingram, and Becca
Bolton netted 13, 12, and 10 points re-
spectively, while senior center Kaitlyn
Kamp also added 10.

Bolton also collected 11 rebounds
to bring. her double-double total for the
‘season to 11. Bolton’s end-to-end game
seems to be rubbing off on the team, as
Wilson also nabbed 11 boards for her
ﬁrst career collegiate double-double.
Ingram stretched her ODAC-leading
assist average by dropping 8 dimes and

Kamp set a personal season-high seven
rebounds.

ODAC powerhouse RMC came visit-
ing on Saturday. They entered the game
with an impressive 16-6, 14-4 ODAC
record and a legitimate star in 6’ 2” se-
nior center Molly Ariail. She came into
the game leading the conference with a
20.7 point per game average. But it was
W&L who made the statement in this
crushing 73-56 victory.

’ Despite the 42-25 halftime score and
the eventual 17 point margin of victory,
W&L shot just 39 percent in this con-
test. However, superior fundamentals
turned an otherwise lackluster shooting
performance into a basketball clinic. The
Generals outrebounded RMC 51-28, 21
of which were offensive boards. With all
these extra possesions, W&L was able
to ﬁre 61 shots in the game and make the
Yellow Jackets pay for letting them have
second (and sometimes third) chances.

Bolton led all scorers with 21 points

and took down 15 rebounds for yet an-
other double-double. Ingram used an
etﬁcient 6-10 shooting performance to

"net 18 points and ripped the twine on all

four of her three point attempts.

Junior Felice Herman had the un-
enviable task of defending Ariail, but
she dominated the match—up. Herman
scored 16 points, collected 10 rebounds
and hassled Ariail into a 4 of l 1 shooting
performance and a mere 10 points.

With the latest win, W&L set the pro-
gram record for consecutive home wins
with seven. The Generals will be look-
ing for the Warner Center advantage to
continue next week as they close out
their regular season. The Generals travel
to Eastern Mennonite on Tuesday, then
have back to back home games versus
ﬁrst place Roanoke College and Bridge-
water College on Friday and Saturday.
As of right now, W&L has the third
seed for the ODAC conference playoffs
which begin on Feb. 25.

Peyton Manning a choker? Not so fast

The QB has gotten a lot of ﬂack for his Super Bowl performance, but the four—time MVP isn ’t as horrible as the media might have you think

By Adam cancryn
CDLUMNIST

Roughly seven years ago, Peyton‘

Manning was labeled a choker.

He had just ﬁnished throwing four
interceptions in the 2003 AFC Cham-
pionship game, and the whispers of the
past few years had become front-page
headlines. Peyton Manning is a choker.
When it comes time to win the big game,
he collapses. -

If that seems like ages ago, you’re not
alone. Since then, Manning has worked
hard to clear his name. He threw for
49 touchdowns in ‘04, won two more
MVPs and threw for 4,000+ yards ﬁve
times, all while leading the Colts to the
playoffs every single year.

In the midst of all that, Manning
broke through the media-constructed
Super Bowl barrier, winning a world
championship in 2007. He had his ring,
and now, ﬁnally, it was acceptable to
embrace him again as a great quarter-
back. The criticisms turned into praise:
“Bland and uninspiring” became “ruth-
less and efﬁcient,” “over-thinker” be-
came “cerebral.” Where he'once blamed
his teammates, now he just tried to make
them better.

In the weeks leading up to the show-
down with the Saints, debate exploded
over Manning’s ranking amongst the
NFL’s greats. How did he compare to

lie, so selﬁshly tarnish his legacy? Near-

The difference, of course, is wins. And that is the catego-

ry that will hound Manning throughout his career. More

so than in any other sport, wins are precious in football.

 

and, more contemporarily, Tom Brady?

Would a win in Miami establish him as
the greatest of all time?

How silly those disputes seemed as
Tracy Porter trotted into the end zone,
cradling Manning’s last pass of the sea-
son.

With one ill-timed throw, the tide
once again turned against the Colts QB.
He had failed again, had brought his
team to the cusp of greatness only to
lose it all.

He had choked.

And this time, we were going to make
sure no one forgot it. The days following
that fateful interception were ﬁlled with
rancor. How could Manning, given a
second chance by the all-powerful pub-

ly everyone with a pen blasted Manning,
recounting his failures in each of his 18
postseason games. Forget greatest of
all time, Kansas City Star writer and
ESPN contributor Jason Whitlock felt
he shouldn’t even be in the discussion.

“The greatest of all time? Nope. Not
even close now. The G.O.A.T. doesn’t
throw that kind of awful interception.
Joe Montana didn’t throw those in the
Super Bowl,” Whitlock wrote‘. “He’s
now 9-9 in the playoffs, which is about
as far away from G.O.A.T. material as
the Middle East is from the Colts’ prac-
tice facility.”

And so the cycle begins anew. But
before the “Manning as choker” band-
wagon ﬁlls up completely, take a deeper

look at his alleged playofffailures. Man-
ning might not be football’s Jordan, but
he also isn’t nearly the disaster that
many would have you believe.
Manning entered the NFL in 1998.
One year later, his team was playoff-
bound at 13-3, the best record since
1968. Over Manning’s next 11 years,
the Colts made the playoffs 10 times.
By comparison, Brady has steered his
team to the postseason six times in
eight full seasons and Kurt Warner just
ﬁve out of 12. Manning even tops Mon-
tana, who made the playoffs just over
70 percent ofthe time.

But getting there has never been the
problem for Manning. He’s owned the
regular season, compiling 32 individual
NFL records and winning three MVPs.
It is his play when it counts that stinks,
critics say. Look at Manning’s stats in
the postseason, however, and there is
little indication he plays at anything but
his best.

In 18 playoff games, just two more
than a regular season, Manning has 28
touchdowns against 19' interceptions.
Additionally, he’s set 11 NFL postsea-
son records, including most 300+ and
400+ yard passing games and biggest
comeback in AFC Championship his-
tory. Compare Manning to Brady, who

is often held as the antonym of choke,
and thetwo are scarily similar. Over the
same number of games, Manning has
more yards and a better completion rat-
ing, while Brady has four fewer inter-
ceptions and a higher quarterback rating
byjust 1.05 points.

The difference, of course, is wins.
And that is the category that will hound
Manning throughout his career. More so
than in any other sport, wins are precious
in football. They are what vaulted a me-
diocre Joe Namath to mythical status
and buried Jim Kelly’s otherwise stellar
career. Manning is 9-9 in the playoffs,
a respectable record, but nothing com-
pared to Brady’s 14-4 or Montana’s 17-
7.

So while Manning might not have
deserved G.O.A.T. consideration, so too
should he be spared from much of the
post-interception vitriol. Sports have
become so heavily scrutinized that, of-
ten times, perspective is lost within the
heap of manufactured debates and hy-
per-analyzed storylines. Manning is not
the greatest quarterback of all time. He
is not the worst choker of all time. He
is simply an excellent quarterback, with
strengths and weaknesses, and half a ca-
reer of hard work left to go.

Two road victories

The Generals defeated Lynchburg and Bridgewater to improve to [5-7 overall

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The best way to get over a snapped
win-streak is to respond with a new one.
After falling to Randolph—Macon at home
last week, the Washington and Lee Uni-
versity men’s basketball team went back
on the road and returned with two more
ODAC victories. The Generals ousted
Lynchburg College 71-62 on Wednesday
and survived a late game surge to defeat
Bridgewater College 75-71 on Saturday.

The Generals are now 15-7 overall and
7-6 in ODAC conference play.

-LC proved a tough competitor for the
Generals, but 45.3 percent shooting from
the ﬂoor and a strong defensive perfor-
mance gave the Generals the victory and
senior captain forward Zac White a school
record. White tied with Rob Smitherman
for the most blocked shots in a game with
seven. Smitherman posted the record in
1979.

The Generals maintained a comfort-
able lead through most of the ﬁrst half.
W&L shot 50.0 percent from the ﬂoor and
ﬁrst-year guard Hans Harris scored nine
consecutive points for the Generals. But
the Hornets weren’t about to just hand the
W&L a blowout before they even hit the

The Hornets now trailed
by only one point, level-
ing the score out at 48-
47. But that was as close

get.

locker room. Lynchburg seized momen-
tum and responded with an 1 1-4 run to set
the score at 35-29 heading into halftime.
The battle of momentum continued
into the second half. The Hornets came
out shooting, but W&L just kept hitting
theirs shots. Senior captain forward Ben
Goestch cashed in a lay-up, followed by
a 3-pointer from ﬁrst-year Jeremy Adkins
and a tip-in by ﬁrst-year J.D. Ey to expand
the Generals’ lead to 42-33 less than four
minutes into the half. A lay-up by senior
forward Andrew Payne and back-to-back
lay-ups by Goetsch pulled the Generals

ahead by 10, giving them a 48-38 lead
with 13:20 remaining in the game.

But W&L saw its lead squandered as
missed shots and turnovers gave the Hor-
nets a 9-0 run. The Hornets now trailed by
only one point, leveling the score out at
48-47. But that was as close as the Hor-
nets would get. The Lynchburg drive was
a wake-up call for the Generals and the
Hornets never gained the lead. Two foul
shots from White and another tip-in from
Ey moved the Generals ahead 52-47 and
they never looked back.

Foul shots from White and Ey se-

cured the game in the closing minutes and‘ .

W&L won 71-62.

W&L ﬁnished the game with just nine
turnovers. Junior guard Jason Cimino and
Goetsch had 13 points apiece to lead the
Generals. White put up 12 and Harris and
Ey each had nine.

The Generals next faced off against
Bridgewater who had tripped up the Gen- 1
erals 68-64 in thetwo teams’ last meeting
Dec. 2. The Generals had mounted a late
game surge, but it wasn’t enough to hold
off the Eagles. This time around, it was the
Eagles who didn’t have enough.

Bridgewater kept the game close
throughout the ﬁrst half and the Generals
led by only four, at 35-31, heading into
halftime. But that deﬁcit grew to 51-38 af-
ter a 16-7 Generals’ run to open the second
half. Bridgewater never regained the lead
after the halfway mark. The closest they
would come was three points, trailing 69-
66 with a little over a minute left to play.

The Eagles were forced to resort to
fouling, but the strategy didn’t pay off.
W&L drilled six of their last eight free
throws to secure the 75-71 victory.

Ey earned career highs in both points
and rebounds, scoring 14 and posting up
nine boards. Goetsch once again led the
Generals with 18 points and six boards.
Adkins added 14 points and Cimino con-
tributed ﬁve points, six assists, and four
steals.

The Generals now head back to their
home gym for a rescheduled match-up
against No. 1 ranked Guilford. The “Blue
Out”‘ begins with a 7 p.m. tip-off in the
Warner Center.
