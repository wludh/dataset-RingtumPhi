VOLUME CXIII,

, Is America

‘Overtreated?’

Author Shannon Brownlee
demands less spending on

unnecessary healthcare

By Diandra Spicak
NEWS EDITOR

Forty-seven million people in the United States
lack healthcare insurance, and the number is growing.
One in six people under the age of 65 does not have
access to healthcare, and last year 20,000 Americans
died prematurely due to this absence of healthcare ,
according to Shannon Brownlee.

Former Senior Research Fellow and Bernard L.
Schwartz Fellow at the New America Foundation,
Brownlee spoke at Stackhouse Theater last Tuesday
as the ﬁrst speaker in the Johnson Lecture series. A
mix of humor, hard-hitting statistics and anecdotes,
Brownlee’s speech delineated the plight of many an
uninsured American in today’s society while pushing
the overall message of overtreatment in the healthcare
industry.

‘We fail to provide the needed
care, and provide healthcare that
they do not need instead... It 3 sort
of the Goldilocks principle. ”

SHANNON BROWNLEE, speaker

“This is the terrible paradox of our healthcare sys-
tem. We fail to provide the needed care: and provide
healthcare that they do not need instead,” she said.

‘ “It’s sort of the Goldilocks principle: we know that

too little care is bad for you, we know that too much
is bad for you. What you really want is just the right
amount.”

Brownlee proposed a few solutions to combat
what she refers to as “healthcare zombies,” or the
problems that face the healthcare industry and prevent
the industry from providing qualitative and quantita-
tive care to as many people as possible. She proposed
going after the regions in the country notorious for
spending the most but reaping the worst outcomes,
measuring the outcomes of the healthcare provided
by hospitals and more.

“We need to pay for care in a very different way,”
Brownlee said. “We’re getting what we pay for, but
we’re paying for them to do more, not to give better
care. I [also] think we need to have a very different way
patients decide whether they want elective procedures
and surgeries. We need a more democratized relation-
ship between physicians and patients.”

Brownlee also stressed the idea that good health
care comes from the bottom up, placing emphasis on
primary care instead of specialists.

“We need to beef up primary care and not succumb
to the call for more specialists,” she said. “Every de-
cent health care system in the world starts with robust
primary care, and every good health care system starts
with a good primary care ofﬁcial.” I

In the face of a country which seems reluctant to
pass health care reform, Brownlee still manages to
ﬁnd the bright side of things—even while spouting
against overtreatment. Her convictions rang true
throughout the speech as she ticked off the horrors of
overtreatment and undertreatrnent, but the author of
“Overtreated: Why Too Much Medicine is Making
Us Sicker and Poorer” (2007) still looks towards the
future of healthcare.

“I have a prediction. We’re going to pass some sort
of healthcare, and it’s going to help more people,” she
said. “If it doesn’t have some sort of public option, the
health insurance industry is going to get some kind of
huge boost. None of it is going to be easy. It’s not going
to be easy to transform a 2.4 trillion [dollar] industry.
It’s going to require changing patients’ minds. And
sometimes less really is more.”

Brownlee was only the ﬁrst of several public policy
experts to discuss issues pertaining to U.S. national
interests at W&L this year as part of the Johnson
Program’s “State of the Union” lecture series.

An accident this weekend injures a student and prompts community to remember safety

By Alllson Chopln
MANAGING EDITOR

An accident involving a Traveller
Express bus and a female student near
a party on Furrs Mill Road early Sat-
urday morning left the student injured
and hospitalized.

The university is awaiting the
report from the Virginia state police
before details can be conﬁrmed. Ac-
cording to Dawn Watkins, Dean of
Students, the community is currently
concerned with the student’s health
above all else.

As of Saturday afternoon, the stu-
dent was still hospitalized at Roanoke
Memorial Hospital and doing ﬁne,
Watkins said.

According to senior Brian Devine,
who witnessed the accident, 15 or
20 students were waiting outside of
County Seat, a house near the corner
of Furrs Mill and US-l l. A Traveller
bus turned on to Furrs Mill heading
toward the Pole Houses, where there
isia designated Traveller stop on the
Red Line.

There is not a stop at County Seat,
but the crowd of students “surged
forward” in an attempt to stop the bus
and a get a ride, Devine said.

“Since everyone was pushing,
trying to be at the front of the line, it
was perhaps inevitable that someone
would fall,” he said.

A female student fell underneath

the rear tires of the bus, according to '

Devine, and the crowd yelled at the
driver to back up and free her. Devine
and others ran to her side as they
waited for paramedics to arrive.

Watkins stressed that it is important
to give support to the student’s family,
and members of her ofﬁce have been
in close contact with the family.

The university has cooperated with
the police investigation and will con-

She said details from the police
report and the university’s investiga-
tion will guide any changes that may
be made to the Traveller program.

Some witnesses and others have
suggested that this incident cannot be
blamed on Traveller, but that the fault
lies with the irresponsible mentality of
crowds at student parties.

“The true fault is that 20 or so
W&L students were so selﬁshly eager

“We are not immune to tragedy... I hope that this

accident, though unfortunate, will act as a wake—up

call for our student body. ”

KATIE BOILES, Traveller chair

duct its own internal review, according
to the university’s press release.

Some have expressed concern
about the future of Traveller, but
Watkins said that the safe ride program
will not be stopping service.

“Traveller is there for a very impor-
tant reason,” she said. It exists for the
safety of students and is “continually
under review.”

Q

to get on Traveller that they effectively
pushed one of their own underneath a
bus,” said Devine.

“If people living in the country
keep ignoring the basic safety of their
guests, this incident will not be the
last,” he said.

Senior Katie Boiles, chair of Trav-
eller, said students should assume per-
sonal responsibility in being conscious

of safety at parties.

They should be aware that the
buses will only stop at designated
stops, for example, and they should
pay attention to the Traveller moni-
tors who can help direct crowds and
answer questions, she said.

“We are not immune to tragedy,”
said Boiles. “I hope that this accident,
though unfortunate, will act as a wake-
up call for our student body.”

She added that students should
remember that Traveller is a privilege,
and this privilege requires respect for
Traveller drivers.

“We pride ourselves on honor and
integrity, but how honorable is it to
bang on the windows and door of a
bus while screaming at a driver to let
you on?” she asked.

This is the ﬁrst accident result-
ing in an injury since the inception
of the Traveller program about ﬁve
years ago.

Hearing board havoc

Committee charged with reviewing SFHB, student leaders question process

By Alllson Chopln
MANAGING EDITOR

Washington and Lee is looking at
the way it currently handles cases of
assault, discrimination and harass-
ment.

This term President Ken Ruscio
appointed a committee to study
the Student-Faculty Hearing Board
(SFHB) and suggest revisions to the
board’s judicial process.

While many students are glad to
see the SFHB come under review,
some—even members of the Execu-
tive Committee—are questioning the
efﬁcacy of the committee.

The SFHB is responsible for hear-
ing cases regarding discrimination,
hazing and sexual misconduct or
harassment. There are typically eight
students and eight faculty members
on the board, in addition to a faculty

I chair and a student vice-chair.

The faculty chair is selected by
the university provost, while the vice-
chair is appointed by the EC.

According to a news release from
the review committee, members of
the W&L community have recently
“expressed concern regarding the
general structure of” the SFHB.

At a student body meeting called
this past spring, several students
claimed that they did not know what
the SFHB was, how cases were
handled or how to go about reporting a

case. Some expressed concerns about
conﬁdentiality of the accuser and ac-
cused in cases of sexual assault, while
others suggested that more transpar-
ency is necessary to maintain W&L’s
tradition of student self-govemance.

The review committee, appointed ,,

by Ruscio, is made up of Dean Rod
Smolla, senior Alex Eichenbaum;
third-year law student Patrick Rowe,
Trustee Jessine Monaghan, Trustee
Robert Grey, Provost June Aprille,
Dean Dawn Watkins, Professor Mi-
chael Anderson and Professor Robin
Wilson.

The committee is seeking input
from the community as it completes
its study. It has already held one open
forum, and the members also plan to
meet with interested groups or indi-
viduals who would like to contribute
their views.

Interested community members
may also submit suggestions online.

The committee’s initial focus
includes examining the SFHB’s
structure, standards and deﬁnitions
of prohibited conduct, jurisdiction in
relationship to other judicial bodies
on campus, procedures and sanctions,
public image and its guiding values.

At the open forum held in Northen
Auditorium on Wednesday, students
and community members had the
chance to share their views in front
of the members of the review com-
mittee.

A few of the students present
shared their concern that a majority of
W&L students do not know how the
SF HB works, and some probably have
not even heard of the board.

Some pointed out that W&L stu-
dents are repeatedly told about the
university’s high sexual assault rate,
yet the SFHB deals with only a few
cases. They wonder why cases are not
reported more often. Moreover, as one
student pointed out, since the board is
infrequently used, it is hard to judge
the SFHB’s record of success.

Another concern was uncertainty
over the SF HB ’s relation to the EC, as
well as the Student Judicial Council,
which handles student misconduct.

The committee will consider these
suggestions, write a report and hold
another open forum on Oct. 19.

Eichenbaum, the only undergradu-
ate representative on the commit-
tee, said she was pleased with the
discussion at Wednesday’s forum,
even though the turnout from the
community was less than she had
anticipated.

“Those students who attended the
open forum were vocal with their
opinions and had some good sugges-
tions,” she said.

Scott Centorino, Vice President of
the EC, questions whether the review
committee will be able to properly
uphold W&L’s cherished idea of stu-
dent self-govemance when only one

undergraduate is on the committee.

“That seems absolutely befud-
dling,” he said. “It seems to be the
administration saying [it is] going to
ﬁx the SFHB.” '

While Centorino respects the com-
mittee for holding an open forum and
allowing the community to contribute,
he would still like to see more students
on the committee. ‘‘I think students
should have a more direct voice,”
he said.

He also pointed out some potential
conﬂicts of interest. Some members
on the review committee have been
members of the SFHB itself, and
while Centorino said he understands
that their insightis valuable, he does
not believe that they should be active
members of the committee.

For example, Rowe has been on
the SF HB, and Aprille, as provost, has
the responsibility of appointing the
faculty chair of the board. Centorino
questions whether these individuals
can fairly review a judicial body that
has been under their own authority.

Centorino and other EC members
suggested that the EC is not united
on what action should be taken in
response to the review committee’s
process. Eric Hoffman, EC president,
could not be reached for comment
before press time.

Hillel House makes headway

New building will feature environmentally friendly design and new opportunities for Jewish activities on campus

By Chelsea Stevenson
5 TA r r w a IT E R

At the end of this month a
7,000 square foot construction
project promoting economic and
community growth, will be well
underway here on campus. The
comer of Washington and Jef-
ferson Streets will soon become
the home of W&L’s first Hillel
house, which will be up and ready
for community use by September
2010.

Plans and designs for the
house began about two years ago,
after sufﬁcient ﬁmdraising. Proj-
ect Manager Carole Bailey and
Hillel Director Joan Robins have
been working extensively with
architects Glave and Holmes As-
sociates Architecture and Design,
as well as construction managers
Kjellstrom and Lee.

Glave and Holmes, who are

also responsible for the Colon-
nade restoration project, have
made the design and construction
of the Hillel house unique.

The house was designed to
achieve Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED)
Certiﬁcation.

Created by and in association
with the U.S Green Building
Council, LEED is an interna-
tional environmentally concerned
certiﬁcation system. In order to
obtain LEED Certification, a
building must be designed and
constructed with the goal of
improving performance in the
community. This must be ac-
complished by promoting water
efficiency, indoor environmental
quality increases, and carbon
monoxide reduction. The Hillel
house deﬁnitely is in competition
with the renovations of Newcomb

hall to be the ﬁrst W&L building
to achieve LEED.

The exterior design of the
Hillel house will feature a gar-
den with 21 trees and a variety
of vegetation. The plants were
chosen for their ability to to
utilize storm water and remain
alive through dry spells. These
native plants include Rudbeckia
mix, Loose Strife, Little Leaf
Boxwoods, Northern Seaoat, and
Iris. The LEED certiﬁcation pro-
cess continues on the interior with
water—efficient ﬁxtures, which
will treat and conserve storm wa-
ter to help improve Lexington’s
water system.

Aside from the environmental ‘

beneﬁts, the outer appearance of
the house will also change from

- the former Howard House, which

was home to Human Resources
and the Office of Special Pro-

grams, both of which have been
relocated.

Bailey described the side of
the house adjacent to the R. E.
Lee Episcopal Church as looking
“buffer.” The narrow church alley
that once existed will be turned
into a sidewalk, to beneﬁt the
church traffic as well. Internally,
the house will also contain many
non-environmental assets.

The interior of the house will
include a lounge and a cafe. The
cafe, which will be open for
breakfast and dinner on the meal
plan, will feature multiple kosher
options, including a large bagel
component. Alex Dasilva, the
director of campus dining at W&L
has been playing a large role in
this process. ’

A large multipurpose room for
Hillel ceremonies and services
will also be on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. This

multipurpose room will feature a
Torah that was rescued from the
Holocaust, which will be widely
appreciated during W&L’s annual
Holocaust Remembrance Week.
The upstairs of the house will
be home to ofﬁces, conference
rooms, restrooms and a study
area.

Joan Robins, the director of
W&L Hillel, has predicted many
signiﬁcant beneﬁts that the design
and presence of the house will
bring to the W&L community.
Founded in‘ the l960’s and re-
vived in 1989, Hillel is entirely
student-run and brings many
activities to campus, which ap-
peal to a broad range of Jewish
students.

These activities include sig-
niﬁcant programs and trips. For
example, Hillel will sponsor the
ten-day Birthright Israel trip in

December and June, and a trip to
Uruguay in February.

Over 165 different people
donated a combined 4 ‘million
dollars to the project. A quarter
of this ﬁmdraising was donated
by eight Zeta Beta Tau brothers
of the class of 1959, in honor of
their 50”‘ reunion here at W&L.
Zeta Beta Tau, which no longer
has a chapter here, is the ﬁrst na-
tional Jewish fraternity. The W&L
Board of Trustees and numerous
local community members made
signiﬁcant contributions to the
fundraising as well, especially
Rector Don Childress ’70 and
Mark Eaker ’69. According to
Robins, this illustrates a large
community-based inclusiveness
that she hopes will be incorpo-
rated into the end product, the
completion of the house.

CKP collaborates with Walmart

Walmart donates unneeded food and supplies to W&L is Campus Kitchen as part of new partnership

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

The Campus Kitchen Project
at Washington and Lee (CKP)
has been receiving food donations
from the local Walmart since the
beginning of September.

The W&L kitchen began
working with Walmart through
its partnership with Feeding
America, the nation’s largest
hunger-relief organization, and
the Blue Ridge Area Food Bank.
It is the ﬁrst kitchen to partner
with Walmart.

CKP is currently receiving 700
to 1,500 pounds of food a week,
nearly six times what it received
last year.

“CKP was bursting at the
seams with its visionary outreach,
and this partnership allows us to
serve more people more food,”

said Caitlin Edgar, who is a
member of the CKP leadership
team.

Most of the food that is
received from Walmart is dairy,
baked goods and dry grocery
products. Most of the food that
is received is gently damaged
foods ,including dented cans and
cartons of eggs in which one egg
may be cracked.

“Walmart has high standards
on what can be sold, so there is
an abundance of perfectly good
food that they cannot sell because
of damaged packaging. The
number of eggs that they were
throwing out was unbelievable,”
said volunteer Austin Branstetter,
who participated in the first
Walmart food pick-up. “From
now on, CKP will supply more
than enough food to ﬁll the fridges

and many hungry mouths.”

CKP received mainly already-
cooked food from some fraternity
houses, W&L Dining Services
and local businesses. The CKP
has added two more cooking
positions due to the amount of
raw food that it receives from
Walmart. Three more pick-up
positions have also been added to
transport the food from Walmart
to CKP three times a week.

The extra food donated by
Walmart has allowed CKP to feed
more people more often. “lt’s
given the leadership team and the
interns a new level of energy and
excitement. Now we can ﬁnally
move forward with the plans
we had in the past,” said CKP
coordinator Jenny Sproul.

One of the plans include
creating new programs with

-new agencies. CKP is currently

working on outreach with the
Glasgow community using a
backpack program. Students who
qualify for one to two free meals
per day at school will be eligible
for a backpack ﬁlled with basic
pantry items to take home for the
weekend. “This will ensure that
the children have enough food
to eat over the weekend,” said
Edgar.

About sixty volunteers donate
their time to CKP per week,
according the Sproul, and nearly
400 volunteer throughout the
school year. With the increase
of food available, CKP needs
more help than ever. It currently
has a 14-person leadership
team, including two work-study
students. “I’m learning how to
make it more of a student-oriented

program,” said Sproul.

CKP is currently partnering
with Habitat for Humanity, the
Magnolia Center (Rockbridge
Area Community Services
Board), the Manor at Natural
Bridge, Project Horizon, Waddell
Head Start, R.E. Lee Apartments,
Lexington City Ofﬁce on Youth,
Lexington Presbyterian Church,
Natural Bridge Elementary
School, Rockbridge Area
Hospice and Rockbridge Area
Occupational Center.

The partnership with
Rockbridge Area Occupational
Center involves building
relationships with the clients.
“There is an unbelievable amount
of need in that community, and
because of our new resources
we can reach out to help. We are
becoming more involved in the

community in more ways than just
meal deliveries,” said volunteer
Shiri Yadlin.

The W&L kitchen is also
partnering with the Rockbridge
Area Free Clinic. The partnership
focuses on a diabetes education
class promoting a healthy
lifestyle.

PizzaReddi, Lexington’s
newest pizza parlor, is also
contributing to the CKP cause.
In order to keep their products
fresh, PizzaReddi removes pizzas
that have been sitting on the
warmer for over a certain length
of time. The pizzas that are taken
off of the warmers are frozen and
donated to CKP, which later heats
them up to provide partners with
a hot meal.

While you’re out... be smarter about Traveller

In light of the recent Traveller accident, Cody Beauchamp wonders how to make sober rides safer

By Cody Beauchamp
COLUMNIST

So, can we talk about the fact
that a Washington and Lee stu-
dent got run over by a bus this
weekend?

In the interest of full disclo-
sure, I should note that I was not
actually at the scene of the acci-
dent Friday night. What follows
is what I was told by at least a
dozen different people who were
at the scene. The various stories
each conﬁrm the following basic
facts, so I assume what follows is
fairly accurate.

It was a typical big party night
at the Poles. A Traveller bus was
nearing the County Seat stop
when it was swarmed by dozens
of drunk students all wanting to

board. As the bus tried to halt-

ingly make its way through the
crowd, a student near the front of
the crowd was pushed forward
and crushed under the bus.

This student, whose identity I
won’t be revealing out of respect
for their privacy, had to be taken
the hospital by ambulance, and
I’ve since heard rumors that his
or her injuries consist of every-
thing from a simple broken leg
right up to shattered legs, hips
and vertebrae.

Besides wishing the student
the quickest and best recovery

possible, I want to address two
other points. The ﬁrst is that
something like this was bound to
happen eventually. The second is
that we all have a responsibility
to ensure that something like this
never happens again.

On the ﬁrst point, I would ask
anyone who has ever been to a
country party to think about the
experience. Speciﬁcally, think
about the role that Traveller plays
at these country parties.

Looking back over all these
party nights, I remember scores
of times this exact same thing al-
most happened.

One friend described it to
me as something out of zombie
movie; the crowd all wants to
go somewhere to the next party,
the Quad, somewhere, and when
they see a Traveller bus coming
their way, they lose all their com-
mon sense and swarm the bus.

Future Phi Beta Kappas will
lose their damn minds and stand
in the middle of the road, all be-
cause they’re determined to get
on Traveller, trafﬁc laws of the
Commonwealth be damned.

Which brings me to my sec-
ond point: at the risk of sounding
patronizing, this is a problem.
Um. . .duh. '

W&L is full of very smart
people. The fundamental prob-
lem is not that we’re stupid
enough to think we should ac-
tually swarm a moving tvvo-ton
bus. The fundamental problem
is that when we need Traveller,
we’re hammered.

I’m not going to say the so-
lution is that we should all drink

care of beforehand.

My ﬁrst year at W&L, I was
asked to do a number of articles
for the Phi on how overcrowd-
ing on the Traveller system was
causing trouble. Apparently, that
problem has neither gone away
nor been ﬁxed in the intervening
years.

We need more Traveller buses

By God, we ’re drunk, we ’re in the

country and we will get to where we

want to go!

less, or that we should all behave
ourselves when Traveller rolls
up. I’m not na'1've enough to think
that either thing will happen, re-
gardless of how many tibias are
shattered or how many preachy,
“Remember the Honor System!”
editorials are published. By God,
we’re drunk, we’re in the coun-
try, and we will get to where we
want to go!

Instead, I propose that the
solution lies before the parties
— these are logistical concerns
that can be anticipated and taken

Law and undergrad divide

Law student laments the disappointing status

By Jordan Rothman
co LU M NIST

I have always wanted to at-
tend Washington and Lee. Ever
since I applied to colleges as a
senior in high school, I knew that
W&L was the right place for me.
The small community, the sense
of history, and many other attri-
butes all increased my desire to
attend the institution.

I ended up not applying to
W&L for my undergraduate
studies, because my parents
strongly urged me to attend

enough to complete a Master’s
degree during my senior year of
college. This ﬂuidity extended
from the academic arena to so-
cial and extra-curricular life on
campus.

Grad students were invited to
every campus event, competed
on athletic and academic teams,
went to parties with undergrads
and otherwise participated in the
varying parts of the Brandeis ex-
perience.

that law students and undergrads
are just different. Somehow gra-
dating from college makes one a
totally different person, incapa-
ble of fully breaking the divide.
I, for one, do not believe that
there is much appreciable dif-
ference between law students
and undergrads, certainly noth-
ing that would merit a perpetu-
ation of the divide. For instance,
I may have a B.A. and an M.A.
But I am still only 22 years old,

We are all one community here at W&L, and I think that we all

should do more toward bridging the law school/undergrad divide.

Brandeis. Nevertheless, I knew
that if I worked hard enough,
got the right grades, and studied
diligently for the LSAT, perhaps
someday I could enroll at W&L
Law.

Once admitted this May, I
hoped that I could perhaps ex-
perience some of what it might
have been like to be an undergrad
here. Though of course tethered
to my legal studies, I hoped to
gain the full W&L experience

It seems, however, that there
is a law school-undergrad divide
here at our university. Not only
are these communities separated
by a road and a separate campus,
but they also seem divided by so
much more than geographic bar-
riers.

To a large extent, this division
makes sense, as law students and
undergrads take classes in sepa-
rate buildings, have divergent
goals and are disconnected for
a number of other reasons. Yet,
we are all one community here
at W&L, and I think that we all
should do more toward bridging
the law school-undergrad divide.

I had sort of a unique expe-
rience as an undergrad. The line
between undergraduate and grad-
uate studies at Brandeis is very
thin, and I was even fortunate

I remember having grad stu-
dents in my classes, as my RAs
and as members of a number of
clubs and activities. All told, I
expected to have similar expe-
riences here, but this belief was
somewhat mistaken.

Law students are not mem-
bers of many undergrad clubs,
and I even had to jump through
hoops to write for this paper.
Furthermore, many undergrad
events are not directly advertised
to law students, and I must typi-
cally get event information see-
ond-hand.

Also, there are not many
ways to socialize with members
of the undergraduate commu-
nity, and though I live in Woods
Creek with undergrads, I hardly
ever meet them. I assure you, I
don’t desire to meet undergrads
in order to put the moves on
them or for any other reasons of
that nature. I just want to interact
with the people with whom I will
be sharing this campus for the
next three years.

All told, though we have one
executive committee and are
such a small university, the law
school-undergrad divide per-
sists.

Many people might fortify
this divide because they believe

and fail to see how being four
months out of undergrad should
merit me hearing some sort of
special status.

All told, undergrads are really
nice to me (and presumably to
other law students as well), and I
am not saying that I am receiving
a cold shoulder from the under-
graduate community for being a
law student.

What I am trying to say, is that
people should try harder to inte-
grate the two communities. Law
students like to party as much as
you do, and we deﬁnitely like
any event that has free food.

In addition, because our uni-
versity is so small and there
isn’t much else going on in Lex-
ington, we might as well get to
know each other. ,

I know there have been sto-
ries of how law students have
only attempted to breach the di-
vide to hit on the undergrads. I
also know that some may think
that we had our time as under-
grads, and should stick to the law
school community.

Nevertheless, I hope that
people proactively take steps to
bring our university together and
bridge the law school-undergrad
divide.

   
      
 
  
 

and better deﬁned stops. People
should have a lamppost, or a
“Form a Line Here” sign, or a
tumstile, or something that pre-
vents them from thinking that the
best way to land a seat is to gate-
crash a moving van.

For that matter, we should
have people at these stops who
are both capable of working
crowd control and willing to do
it. Perhaps the gentlemen throw-
ing these parties would be will-
ing to volunteer a few people to
keep this kind of problem from

happening in the future?

Before I go on, I Want to make
it clear I’m not faulting any fra-
ternity for what happened to the
injured student.

I know that Sigma Chi had
hired drivers for the party they
threw that caused the country
crowds. When I went out to pick
up stranded friends after the ac-

cident, I even saw a lot of Sig-
ma Chi upperclassmen helping
ﬁnd rides for the people who
had been stranded at the Pole
Houses. I commend them for
that; they did not at all seem
negligent to me.

Nonetheless, this incident
has made it perfectly clear that
what we’re already doing is

not enough. So, as painful and as
much of a hassle as it is, maybe
we need to do more.

Maybe we should start build-
ing crowd control barriers so that
drunk girls in stilettos can’t get
within falling range of a moving
bus (anyone else see a problem
with this?).

Maybe we should start expect-
ing the IFC to require its member
organizations to do more to sup-
port Traveller than what it cur-
rently does (which, as far as I can
tell, is basically the equivalent of

a thumbs-up).

Maybe we should start asking
party hosts to provide people to
work Traveller crowd control.
After all, these parties are rec-
ognized as important enough to
have a mass transit system run
directly to them. Maybe requir-
ing that a few sober brothers
work Traveller is actually a fair
price for having what is basically
school sponsorship of private
parties.

Again, I don’t want to give
the impression that I’m out to
condemn any organization or
even our cultural bacchanalia.

It’s just that, quite obviously,
we need to do something to keep
this kind of thing from happening
again. I’m told that if the injured
student had been a few inches
farther under the bus, his or her
spine would have been shattered.
I’m told that if he or she had
fallen head-ﬁrst instead of feet-
ﬁrst, he or she would have been
killed.

W&L hasn’t had a student
killed because of drunk driving
in a‘ very long time. It will be a
sad, sad irony if one dies because
our safe-ride systems continue to
be so overwhelmed. _

Catharine MacKinnon and the future of gender

Aleisha Butler analzyes gender as a stereotype based on social constructs rather than biology

By Alelsha Butler
c 0 L u M N IS T

Catharine MacKinnon, a re-
nowned feminist legal scholar
and law professor, spoke on is-
sues surrounding sexual abuse,
pornography and gender in Lee
Chapel on Thursday. She ﬁrst
addressed the fact that gender as
we understand it is in fact social-
ly constructed, not biological.

Many people use the terms
“sex” and “gender” interchange-
ably, when in reality they are two
different categories.

Sex is biologically deter-
mined: you are born with either
a penis or a vagina, and even that
boundary is sometimes blurred.

Gender, however, is a much
more complicated affair. Across
time and space, the deﬁnitions
of masculinity and femininity
have fluctuated wildly, but what
MacKinnon pointed out was
that, regardless of time or place

or sexual standards, a socially-_

constructed, gendered inequality
has always existed.

In some cultures, there are
more than two genders. This is
hard for us in the Judeo-Chris-
tian, Western world to under-
stand, but here’s an example:
men and women who enjoy and
prefer same-sex (not same-gen-
der) relations are ostracized be-
cause they are not acting as men
and women “should.”

Likewise, in some cultures,
there are men who dress as
women and are considered wom”—
an-like, and in others there are
women who dress as men and
are considered man-like, but they
have full rights and are accepted
for the gender they choose.

We insist on combining biol-
ogy with gender, and still try to
squeeze people into one of the
only two available categories
that our culture provides us with
— “male” and “female. “

MacKinnon discussed how,
in our society, the female half

of the population is subordinate
to the male. That subordination
is maintained through a culture-
wide set of institutions that serve
to socialize males and females
into accepting, and enjoying,
their respective dominant and
subordinate positions.

Her personal theory is that
pornography is responsible for
this structure by promoting and
reinforcing a gendered sexuality
in which the woman is the pas-
sive, submissive receiver. This
is easily transferred into real-life
violence and rape.

Pornography is problematic,
she says, because it teaches our
society that women tolerate rape.
What consumers of porn do not
see is that many of the women in
the industry have been badgered,

overall numbers of rape vic-
tims, they’re currently about 90
percent women and 10 percent
men.

She acknowledged that this
drastic difference may be due
in part to underreported rape of
males, but that underreporting,
she pointed out, is due to the fact
that rape is a humiliating act.

In our society, to be feminine
is to be weak and dependant; the
power of rape is that it feminizes
the person on the receiving end.

Rape demonstrates that the
inequality in our society is not
biological, but gendered. In our
gender dichotomy, where men
are expected to be strong, domi-
nant and aggressive, rape is the
ultimate humiliation. Men are
therefore socialized into liking

paign of crimes against women
has never been seen as the delib-
erate, genocidal efforts to control
and contain that they are.

After this summer’s attack on
an exercise class full of women
in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania,
columnist Bob Herbert wrote in
The New York Times, “We have
become so accustomed to living
in a society saturated with misog-

yny that the barbaric treatment '

of women and girls has come to
be more or less expected... We
would become much saner, much
healthier, as a society if we could
bring ourselves to acknowledge
that misogyny is a serious and
pervasive problem.”

Rape and sexual assault are
hate crimes, and need to be treat-
ed as so.

Professor MacKinnon is talk was incredibly thought—provoking

and unashamedly blunt, characteristics that I think we need to see

l’I’l0I"€ around our campus.

coerced and abused into partici-
pating in these forms of media.

We see a woman “consent-
ing” to a ﬁlm of her being raped,
and therefore think she consent-
ed to it. However, if you look up
“consent” in the dictionary, you
will ﬁnd that it means the same
thing as “yield,” “comply” and
“submit.” Compliance doesn’t
seem like a sexy term, but in
porn it seems to be.

At the end of MacKinnon’s
talk, a VMI cadet in the audience
asked her how she could say that
there was inequality when men
get raped by women, too.

Her response "was incredibly
enlightening. She agreed that
yes, men are raped by women,
but that when you look at the

the dominant position they are
told to be in, while women, who
can be physically controlled by
the men in their lives, learn to
expect, appreciate and work with
. their dependency.

Catharine MacKinnon’s work
has largely centered on represent-
ing abused women in the sex-
for-sale industry. She has writ-
ten legislation demanding that
sexual assault, rape and abuse of
women in pornography be con-
sidered civil rights crimes.

Any other crimes targeted
against speciﬁc groups of peo-
ple, be they African-American,
Hispanic, Jewish, etc., are con-
sidered hate crimes.

MacKinnon points out that the
world-wide, centuries-long cam-

The issue of pornography is
where my opinion differs slight-
ly from MacKinnon’s. A W&L
student asked Professor MacK-
innon if she thought that any-
thing should be done about the
messages being sent in today’s
popular music. While she agreed
the misogyny in popular music
is a problem,.she believes that
pornography is the larger issue.
However, I see it the other way
around.

Young teenagers, fourteen and
ﬁfteen-year-olds, are not likely
to be exposed to porn; they are
likely to turn on the radio and hit
up the Top Ten list on iTunes.

In the formative stages of
their development, just begin-
ning to sort out what it means

to be a man or a woman, adoles-
cents are under a constant bar-
rage from the music, movie and
fashion industries.

MacKinnon believes that
pornography leads to a de-
tached, numbed sexuality. While
I believe porn exacerbates those
problems, I think they form long
before young people come in
contact with pornography. ‘

Instant messenger, texting,
and sites like MySpace and
Facebook enable people to have
entire conversations with one an-
other without ever having to see
someone’s face or hear his or her
voice. It has become easier to see
people, especially anonymous
sex actors on a screen, as objects
for your enjoyment.

The problem is that that oh-
jectiﬁcation just transfers over
into real life. In a place like col-
lege, where alcohol obliterates
self-control and inhibitions, the
two make for scary male-fernale
interactions.

Professor MacKinnon thinks
that pornography is inherently
detrimental for women, and that
to eliminate gender hierarchy we
need to eliminate porn. Howev-
er, barring a global nuclear holo-
caust, the media is probably here
to stay and we should utilize it to
make changes.

Rather than try to eliminate
such a huge industry, why not
utilize it for good? Why not make
porn about people who love each
other and use their sexuality to
connect and build trust?

I recently read an article in
which the author called out rap-
per Jay-Z for not working to
change the gender relationships
within his own community. A
proliﬁc musician and inﬂuential
cultural icon, someone like Jay-
Z, who seems to be very hap-
pily married, could do a lot for
his community and the culture

at large by making ideas like
commitment and mutual respect
“cool.”

Finally, if W&L is so truly
committed to changing our
sexual assault climate, why was
Professor MacKinnon’s talk not
mandatory? ‘

The university cannot keep
tabs on all students, but they
could at least have required that
the ﬁrst-years, who are just be-
ginning to sort out the positives
and negatives of college, be in
attendance.

Professor MacKinnon’s talk
was incredibly thought-provok-
ing and unashamedly blunt, char-
acteristics that I think we need to
see more around our campus.

She did not try to soften the
impact of her words. She did not
mind that some people would
be defensive or offended after
her talk; the truth usually causes
such reactions.

I did not blindly agree with
every word that came out of her
mouth, but so much of what she
said would have been so beneﬁ-
cial for our campus to hear.

In attendance last night there
was a scattering of professors,
some upper‘-class W&L students,
and some VMI cadets. The peo-
ple who were in attendance were
not the people who really needed
to hear what she had to say.

In this pivotal, turbulent
moment in history, MacKinnon
urges us to choose the future
we want for ourselves and our
children. I think that if the W&L
administration want to have any
kind of inﬂuence on how their
students treat each other, they
need to bring more people like
MacKinnon to campus, and they
need to ensure that words like
hers are heard.

Pornography is not so evil

In response to Aleisha Butler, Stockton Bullitt examines pornography

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Being a college newspaper
editor has its perks. Besides the
fame, money and women, it al-
lows me to rant and rave about
every little detail with which I
disagree. Basically, I can do what
an English teacher does to your
essays, except that you might ac-
tually read what I’m scribbling
down next to your “A-.”

Since I was in charge of edit-
ing the piece, I had the opportuni-
ty to read Aleisha Butler’s article
on gender before you did.

I would give you a quick re-
cap of what she said, but the ar-
ticle is literally right above mine,
so all you really need to do is
look a little farther up on the page
to see what I’m talking about.

Although Ms. Butler wrote a
wonderful article and had clear-
ly formed and well thought-out
opinions on the subject of gender,
she has one little problem when
it comes to her discussion of the
role of pornography in gender
bias: she’s wrong.

The good news is that I can’t
really blame Ms. Butler for being
wrong.

She has two major factors
stacking up against her with re-
spect to her outlook on pomeg-
raphy. First of all, she is grossly
misinformed, mostly by Catha-
rine MacKinnon. Second, she has
not had nearly enough ﬁrsthand
experience with pornography to
accurately judge its effect.

V Now, I think it is quite obvious
that Ms. Butler cannot be blamed
for either of these problems; nev-
ertheless, she is still quite wrong.

Ms. Butler’s initial problem
is much more Ms. MacKinnon’s
problem than Ms. Butler’s. Ms.
MacKinnon says that pornogra-
phy is bad because “because it

teaches our society that women
tolerate rape.” Women do not
ever “tolerate” rape.

I have yet to hear of one wom-
an who has been ﬁne with being
raped. Furthermore, no woman
ever consents to being raped.
Why? Because if she consented,
it wouldn’t be rape.

Pornography cannot be con-
sidered an inherently misogy-
nistic entity, much less an inher-
ently evil entity. Men do not view
women differently because of
what they see in porn, especially
when it comes to rape. I do not
have evidence of an educational
scholar saying this, mostly be-
cause I am way too lazy to look
anything up, but, trust me, it
doesn’t. I have never met any guy
whose‘ view of women has been
altered thanks to what he has seen
late at night online.

Saying that watching porn
leads to rape, as Ms. MacKinnon
did, is simply ludicrous. For the
most part, pornography features
only consensual sex between
partners. And while there are ap-
parently pornographic videos that
feature heinous things like rape
and child abuse, that in no way
correlates to the entire industry.
Not only are those videos illegal,
but they also have nothing to do
with the industry itself.

Blaming the porn industry for
these videos is like blaming Uni-
versal and Empire Records for a
song that someone independently
recorded and posted on his own
MySpace page. ‘

Ms. Butler alludes to some of
the pitfalls of Ms. MacKennon’s
arguments in her article, but she
could still go further with her dis-
agreement with Ms. MacKinnon.

There are much bigger issues

that contribute to problem of mi-
sogyny than pornography. The
real problem with sexism lies not
in the major forever ﬁnite indus-
tries of today, like pornography,
music and the Internet, but rather
in the minute, easily ﬁxable de-
tails that we encounter on a daily
basis.

These small details are even
evident here on campus, yet they
always seem to go completely
unnoticed.

For example, in the ﬁrst-year
dorms, the boys get the ﬁrst two
ﬂoors, while the girls get the top
ﬂoors. There are reasons for this,
even though the reasons remain
somewhat sketchy. Still, right
on move-in day, the girls are still
subtly forced to carry their lug-
gage those extra few ﬂights of
stairs.

If there is an assumption that
watching a ﬁve-minute video fea-
turing consensual intercourse is
going to make a guy misogynis-
tic, then having all the guys live
on the bottom two ﬂoors in the
ﬁrst-year dorms, when they are
apparently most impressionable,
has to have at least some effect.

An unrelated critique of Ms.
Butler’s assertions is her exami-
nation of the word “consent.” She
says, “Compliance docsn’t seem
like a sexy term, but in porn it
seems to be.”

Now, I have seen a fair share
of pornographic videos in my
life (only for academic purposes
of course), and I have yet to see
“comply” or “consent” used by
the pizza boy or the nurse to try
and seduce his or her partner.

Also, I guess if the word is
used in porn, it probably is not
used in a sexy way, and most of
the time, the uses of the words

“comply” and “consent” is ex-
tremely important.

Those words are used to make
sure that the women appearing in
these videos are treated with as
much respect as possible. How
can‘ they be bad things?

I also took up Ms. Butler’s
advice and looked up the word
“consent” in a dictionary, the
Oxford English Dictionary. She
wrote that after looking up con-
sent, I would ﬁnd a deﬁnition
strikingly similar toithe words
yield, comply and submit.

Unfortunately, only one of
those three words played an inte-
gral role in the deﬁnition of con-
sent in the Oxford English Dic-
tionary. I have used comply and
consent as synonyms in this arti-
cle, so I was not surprised when it
showed up in consent’s deﬁnition,
but the other two words and their
connotations were stunningly
absent from Oxford’s deﬁnition
of the word. I guess we can just
blame that one on the British.

Because of pornography’s
reputation as a sleazy and dirty
trade, it is easy to assume that it is
inherently evil and leads innocent
boys into doing terrible things.

In fact, blaming bad actions
on abstract inﬂuences is always
easy to do. Why blame a murder
on someon’s parents when you
can blame Metallica, Eminem,
and Grand Theft Auto?

And for that matter, why
blame the rapist, when you can
always blame Jenna Jameson,
Ron Jeremy and all of their mali-
cious minions?

I want to break out into spon-
taneous song and dance across the

4 Colonnade.

‘ Not only that, but I want it to
be a campus-wide affair, complete
with jazz hands, shimmies and at-
titude.

That’s the feeling you walk
away with after watching “Fame.”

The remake of the 1980 ﬁlm
follows students at the New York
City High School for the Perform-
ing Arts.

Each student excels in music,
acting or dance, and they’re all
uniﬁed in their pursuit for fame and

. recognition.

The plot focuses on six students

~ as they navigate their individual
paths to professional careers.

There are standard themes such
as love, heartbreak, and external
pressure, but “Fame” also explores
the anxiety associated with compe-
tition and growing up.

The ﬁlm’s strength lies simply
in its entertainment value: dance
sequences, singing and catchy

. soundtrack. .

One moment the students are
engulﬁng their lunches, and sud-
denly, WHAM, they’re pirouetting
and leaping across cafeteria tables.

It’s all about high energy.

The camera angles do a good
job of capturing all of this. ‘

In scenes where a central char-
acter is onstage, the point of view
and surveying pan shots help create
the sense of performance adrena-

. line.

COURTESY OF SAMARA FRANCISCO

‘Fame’ film provides
light-hearted fun

Movie is strong in energetic dance and
song, but gives no deep message

But the ﬁlm fails to deliver any-
thing beyond glittering musical
numbers.

The characters are not sufﬁ-
ciently developed to stand on their
own, and their story lines are weak
because of the focus on six story-
lines with separate problems.

Less is more, and there’s sim-
ply too much going on in too little
time.

At times, the ﬁlm lost its au-
thenticity. It tried to capture the
gritty parts of the audition pro-
cess, but I can safely say, coming
from a similar performing arts high
school, that half of those students

-would be turned away at the door

for wearing street clothes.
Despite the blunders, “Fame”

is not without impressive perfor-'

mances.

Senior captain forward Sallie Arrn-

against a young Limestone team. Arm-

own in the process.

after two blowout wins over Randolph
Macon College and Sweet Briar, Arrn-
strong made sure they did not.

When asked if the team prepared any
differently against a ﬁrst-year program,
Armstrong said, “No, not at all. Our
mentality is to just go out and play just
like we are playing Lynchburg.”

With this attitude, the Generals

“Getting that goal was simply icing
on the cake. I just want to keep winning
games,” said the ever-humble Ann-
strong.

And Armstrong made sure her team
took the victory.

, The ﬁrst period ended with the Saints
hanging tough and the score still only 1-
0, but W&L came ﬂying out of half-time

The Generals had all week to prepare
for the Saints of Limestone. Their last
game was the Saturday before, when
they had throttled Sweet Briar by a com-
manding score of 5-2.

However, Limestone offered a unique
challenge coming into the game. They
are a ﬁrst-year program boasting a mere
17 players on the roster, 15 of whom
are freshmen. As one could imagine,
the Saints have had their growing pains,
struggling to a 1-8 start to the season.

While it could be very easy to over-
look a squad like Limestone, especially

jumped out to a quick lead just 10 min-
utes into the contest. And none other
than Armstrong herself scored the ﬁrst
goal.

With that goal, Armstrong scored her
43rd career goal, fourth for this season,
and passed Jane Beal ’05 to stand alone
at the top of W&L’s list of ﬁeld hockey
goals scored.

Number 19 in the blue and white was
mobbed by her teammates and received
a rousing ovation as her accomplish-
ment was made known over the stadium
speakers.

and Armstrong again set the tone. She
scored just four minutes into the half off
a beautiful play by senior forward Steph
Mansey.

Mansey pushed the ball all the way
down the left wing, ducking and dodg-
ing Limestone players the whole way,
and feeding the ball into the front of the
net where sophomore forward Christina
Benedetti provided the assist for the
Armstrong goal. Just ﬁve minutes later,
Armstrong tallied her third goal of the
night and Benedetti dished out her third
assist off of a penalty corner.

defender

Down 3-0 and failing to have any
sort of extended ball possession, ﬁrst-
year Sara Parker provided a little spark
for Limestone with an unassisted goal.

But the Generals quickly extin-
guished any faint hope the Saints had, as
junior midﬁelder Kate Donnelly buried
a goal off of a feed from junior midﬁeld-
er Emmy Mathews.

Once the ﬁnal horn sounded, the cel-
ebration began. Not only was the great-
est W&L ﬁeld hockey goal scorer of
all time in the house, but the Generals
pushed their record to an even 4-4.

Making the record of most
goals scored “feels pretty good,

said Armstrong. “Jane Beal told me my

freshman year that I would be the one to
break the record. I kind of brushed that
off, but I am just really more concerned
about winning the ODAC. When Jane set
the record, her team won the conference,
so hopefully history repeats itselﬂ”

The Generals fell to Mary Washing-
ton, 3-2, on Sunday. Their next match-up
is at Eastern Mennonite on Wednesday.

To bowl or not to bowl?

Columnist Lee Tackett considers the chances of a non-BCS team makingits way to the BCS championship game

By LeeTackett
COLUMNIST

With a third of the NCAA football
season ﬁnished, it is apparent that the
Bowl Championship Series (BCS) sys-
tem will once again come under intense
scrutiny. With no clear-cut top team,
there is a good possibility that the BCS
conferences will not produce an unde-
feated team at season’s end. And so we
have to ask the timeless question: is this
the year that a team from outside the
BCS gets an opportunity at a champion-
ship? Boise State, Texas Christian and
Houston have stirred up controversy
over their legitimacy as top 15 teams.

Boise State is the elder statesman of
the “mid major” group, with two unde-
feated regular seasons in the past three
years and a win over Oklahoma in the
2006 Fiesta Bowl.

Last year, Boise State was outshined
by another non-BCS team in Utah and
was relegated to a secondary bowl,

where they lost to TCU. Boise State
made a strong statement at the begin-
ning of the season with an impressive
home opener over No. 16 Oregon.

Unfortunately, Boise State has be-
come a victim of its own success and
has struggled to come up with quality
non—conference opponents due to its no-

.toriety and talent level. Coming into this
week, Boise State climbed all the way
up the polls to No.5, the highest regular
season ranking ever for a non-BCS team.
No one can discount Boise State’s win
over Oregon as a program milestone,
but with a weak conference schedule left
to play, it becomes diﬂicult to justify the
Broncos as a top ﬁve team.

Does one win make Boise State bet-
ter than a one—loss team like Virginia
Tech or USC? Probably not, but it is
conceivable that Boise State will contin-
ue to climb up the rankings, as at least

two SEC teams ahead of it are likely to
lose a game this season.

TCU plays in the Mountain West,
the most competitive non-BCS confer-
ence, but has never been able to stake a
true claim toward a BCS bowl. In 2008,
TCU was talked about as a possible
“BCS Buster,” but fell to Oklahoma and
Utah. Thus far, TCU has yet to play a
ranked team, but has two road wins over
the ACC against UVA and Clemson.
TCU will likely get one chance to play
a ranked team when it travels to Provo
in October to play BYU, who knocked
off then—No.2-ranked Oklahoma earlier
this year. If TCU is able to run the table,
it would have a signiﬁcantly stronger
résumé than Boise State. All of its mar-
quee victories will have come on the
road, and its conference schedule is far
more diﬂicult than that of Boise State.

Houston is the true newcomer to this

group. The Cougars have ﬁnally reached
their ﬁnal stages of rebuilding and head
coach Kevin Sumlin has been able to
make Houston relevant again among the
Texas high school football scene. In ad-
dition to an exciting offense, the Cou-
gars have a legitimate Heisman trophy
candidate in junior quarterback Case
Keenum. Houston hasn’t been shy in its
scheduling for 2009. The Cougars have
notched a road victory against then No.5
Oklahoma State and a tough home win
against Texas Tech, but fell to UTEP 58-
41 this Saturday. Unlike TCU or Boise
State, Houston still has a non—confer-
ence game against a major conference
team left on its schedule. Houston will
go on the road to face Mississippi State
next Saturday.

By virtue of the BCS rules, it is near-
ly impossible for three non-BCS con-
ference teams to qualify for BCS bowl

bids. The rule states that if one non-BCS
team ﬁnishes in the top 12 of the BCS
rankings, it must be put in a bowl. The
rule says nothing about the possibility
of three teams not from the power con-
ferences going undefeated. Houston has
a difﬁcult conference schedule to look
forward to in the coming weeks, which
may put it far out of national title con-
tention at season’s end.

But with its current exposure, BCS
voters will see plenty of Houston. TCU
may have a better case to play in a BCS
bowl, as it has taken down better teams
in more adverse environments. But Boi-
se State’s soft remaining schedule and
high pre-season billing may earn the
team a bid to a BCS bowl.

W&L athletics and academics recognized

W&L earns Top 25 ranking in National Collegiate Scouting Association is 2009 Power Rankings

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

An impressive touchdown by a
Washington and Lee running back or
a killer hat trick by a freshman soccer
star may not earn airtime on ESPN. But
W&L athletes are earning another type
of recognition. The Generals may play
hard, but they also work hard.

W&L has been named to the Top
25 of the National Collegiate Scouting
Association’s 2009 Collegiate Power
Rankings. The study highlights the best
schools in the country in terms of both

athletic and academic standards. The
study takes into account the academic
rankings issued by U.S. News &World
Report and the school’s student-athlete
graduation rate.

The study also averages in the results
of the United States Sports Academy
Director’s Cup, which evaluates the
strength of collegiate athletic programs.
Every NCAA and NAIA athletic pro-
gram in the nation is evaluated. W&L
was ranked 21st in the nation, right be-

hind Northwestern University.
Collegiate athletic recruiting isn’t all
about big-name sports schools battling
it out for the nation’s premier athletes.
There are many collegiate athletes who
never see their name on rivals. com, but
go on to be extremely successful in col-
lege athletics. The purpose of the rank-
ings is to provide an additional means to
help prospective athletes make their col-
lege decisions. The NCSA has become
the college recruiting source of choice

for over 35,000 college coaches and
10,000 college athletes.

“The Power Rankings are an objec-
tive tool to empower student athletes to
ﬁnd the right ﬁt in a college or university
not only for its athletics but academics
as well,” said Chris Krause, CEO and
Founder of NCSA. “Our hope is to
educate these student athletes and their
parents on the importance of evaluating
schools that will provide the education
for an enriched, successful career after

college in addition to athletic success.”

Williams College was named No. 1
in the rankings, followed by Amherst
College at No. 2, and Middlebury Col-
lege at No. 3. Other schools included in
the Top 25 are Duke at No. 11, Harvard
University at No. 13, and Yale Univer-
sity at No. 16.

_ W&L women’s tennis racks up titles

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The Washington and Lee women’s
tennis team was out for aces the past
two weekends as the Generals competed
in the W&L Fall Festival and the ITA
Atlantic South Regional at Mary Wash-
ington.

In the Fall Festival, the host team
claimed ﬁrst place in both doubles ﬂights
and two out of the four singles ﬂights.

A total of six Generals advanced to
the championships of the four singles
brackets, with W&L’s two victories
coming from all W&L match-ups. Ju-
nior Catherine Reed defeated ﬁrst-year
Christina Douglas, 6-3, 6-1, to take
the title in the Flight B singles bracket.
First-year Kerry Cotter also earned a

ﬁrst place title with a 6-3, 6-1 win over
junior Crystal Spencer in the Flight D
singles bracket.

Senior Blair Brzeski fell to Katie
Schafer of Mary Washington, 6-0, 6-
1, in the ﬁnals of the Flight A singles
bracket. Brzeski ﬁnished 2-1 overall for
the tournament. Lyndsey Johansson also
took a second place title for the Generals
after falling 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4 to Cassie
Bowman of Mary Washington in the ﬁ-
nals of the Flight C singles bracket.

The team then traveled to Freder-
icksburg for the ITA Atlantic South Re-
gional. Fighting through rain delays, the
Generals walked away with two titles.

In the Blue 3 doubles draw, ﬁrst-years

Christina Douglas and Laura Simmons
defeated Betty Edwards and Zannah
Webster of Meredith, 8-0, in the ﬁnals
to claim the championship. Douglas and
Simmons went undefeated for the tour-
nament with wins over DeSales, Wilkes,
and Mary Washington.

Douglas and Simmons were also
the two ﬁnalists for the Blue 2 singles
bracket. The match was played Tuesday
on the W&L courts. Douglas defeated
Simmons, 6-3, 6-4, to claim the cham-
pionship.

A total of eight singles players and
two doubles squads competed in the
main draw for W&L. In the Champion
singles ﬂight, sophomore Jen Snyder

defeated Wilkes’s Xiaogiao Zhang, 6-3,
6-0 and Salisbury’s Melissa Follett 6-1,
6-1 to advance.

Fellow sophomore Ellen Yeatman
easily defeated Shawnte Woodson of
Hollins 6-0, 6-0 in the ﬁrst round. Yeat-
man’s second round match-up proved to
be more of a battle as she defeated Ran-
dolph-Macon’s Lucy Scherrnerhom, 4-
6, 6-4, 6-1.

Brzeski advanced after beating Kat
Cohen of Washington College, 6-1, 6-0,
and Kathym Maples of Meredith, 6-3, 6-
1. Brzeski fell to Wilkes’s Melanie Nolt
in the next round.

In the Blue 1 singles ﬂight, W&L
ﬁrst-year Sallie Griﬂ‘in advanced to the

main draw with a 6-0, 6-0 win over Dina
Zingaro from Swarthmore.

In doubles, sophomores Trelsie
Sadler and Yeatman defeated Christine
Petrilla and Kate Steiner of DeSales, 8-
1, to advance to the main draw of the
Champion doubles ﬂight. Junior Vir-
ginia Dickinson and sophomore Lauren
Lukas also advanced with an 8-0 victory
over Kat Cohen and Kristine Depew
from Washington College.

The team will travel to Hollins next
weekend to compete in the ODAC sin-
gles championships.

W&L falls in lax classic

New player uncertainties hinder the Generals in 15-13 defeat

By Brooke Sutherland
sPoRrs EDITOR

The Washington and Lee men’s la-
crosse team broke a record this weekend.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t a record they were

 

looking to break. The Generals fell to Vir-
ginia Military Institute, 15-13, in the 23rd
Annual Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Classic this
weekend, marking only the third time in
the history of the event that the Generals
have lost to the Keydets.

“VMI was a very senior-laden, ex-
perienced team,” said Head Coach Gene
McCabe. “We had a lot of guys in starting
roles and key roles for basically the ﬁrst
time. I was impressed with a lot of what
we did. I don’t put too much bear-
ing on this loss. I think it’s the sign
of a very good rivalry. Hopefully
we can learn from this and it will
make us better in the spring.”

Struggling with fall ball nerves
and uncertainties, the Generals got
out to a slow start. VMI put up two
goals, but W&L had no answer,
going scoreless in the ﬁrst quarter.

“It was different than in years
past,” said senior team captain at-
tacker Will Keigler. “We were get-
ting used to new players and new
line-ups. It just took us a while to
gel.” -

As the second quarter opened,
VMI continued to dominate, scor-
ing two more goals in the ﬁrst
three minutes to put the score at 4-
0. But a goal from Keigler with the
assist by junior midﬁelder Drew
Koeneman put the Generals on the
scoreboard.

VMI answered the goal with one of
their own, setting the score at 5-1. Now
facing a four-goal deﬁcit, the Generals

' picked up the pace and attacked the VMI

goal. Junior attack Spence Daw cashed in
a goal off an assist from sophomore at-
tacker Sam Mott. Keigler and Koeneman
then combined for another goal to set the
score at 5-3.

“We were able to start to get into a
rhythm,” Keigler said. “We focused on
making the right passes and the right shots.

The coaches made some good adjustments
and we were able to break down the de-
fense and get some good shots.”

The Generals continued their scoring
streak off a goal by Daw from a Keigler
assist. But VMI retaliated two minutes
later to secure its lead at 6-4. The game
was no longer a story of VMI domination,
but the Generals just couldn’t seem to pull
ahead.

W&L got on the board once more for
the half with a goal from Koeneman off an
assist from Keigler. But a VMI goal late in
the second quarter put the Keydets up 7-5

heading into half-time.

W&L came out swinging in the third
quarter. Koeneman attacked immediately,
putting up an unassisted goal less than a
minute into the quarter. But VMI did not
back down. The Keydets ran up two more
goals to put the score at 8-6.

W&L ﬁnally tied the score midway
through the third quarter after a goal by
W&L ﬁrst-year Cooper Brown followed
quickly by another goal from Daw off an
assist from Keigler set the score at 8-8.

The Generals and the Keydets traded
goals back and forth for the rest of the
third quarter. Goals from Brown, Keigler
and Koeneman kept the score tied at 11-11
heading into the fourth quarter.

Scoring slowed in the fourth quar-
ter, but VMI was able to take charge and
hold off the Generals. W&L put up two
more goals, one from senior attacker Max
Mancuso off an assist from Keigler and
another from Koeneman. But four fourth-
quarter goals gave the Keydets a close 15-
13 victory.

“it was a hard-fought game,” Keigler
said. “Both teams played well. We just
came out of it with the short end of the
stick.”

“I thought VMI played very well,”
McCabe added. “They really deserved
to win. We just need to learn to execute
a little better in certain situations. But I
was very pleased with our team’s effort
throughout the whole game.”

McCabe speciﬁcally highlighted the
play of Koeneman and Keigler, who led
the Generals in scoring and assists. Koen-
eman put up four goals and two assists,
and Keigler added three goals and four
assists.

“Koeneman [is a] superstar on the
ﬁeld,” Keigler said. “He deﬁnitely has the
fastest shot, the hardest shot. He can get a
shot off whenever he wants. He’s unstop-
pable.” Keigler added, “He was clearly
the most dominant player on the ﬁeld last
night.”

The Generals have only one week of
fall practice left before they close out their
fall season with the annual homecoming
alumni game Saturday at 5 p.m. on Wilson
Field. ‘

Initially, [the loss] is pretty frustrating,”
Keigler said. “It’s disappointing. It’s up-
setting. But it doesn’t go into our win-loss
column. It’s the fall. It’s early. We have a
lot of young players. And this game is just
a good ﬁrst step towards spring season.”
