, New federal

policy sends
shock waves

Students convicted of drug
possesion couldlose federal
ﬁnancial aid

By Frank cullo
smrr wrunzn

Some students may have been startled two
weeks ago when they received an inbox message
detailing a new federal policy on drug usage that
affects federal ﬁnancial aid. Students convicted of
either possessing or dealing illicit drugs are liable
to lose any form of federal ﬁnancial aid. Drugs
have never really taken the forefront of issues at
Washington and Lee. Alcohol and gender rela-
tions, yes, but not drugs.

Students have little reason to be alarmed. The
new policy is not a university one, but mandated
by the government. Furthermore, the policy only
deals with forms of federal ﬁnancial aid, such as
Federal Student Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Fed-
eral Grants and even Federal Work Study, but not
university loans.

According to the Financial Aid ofﬁce, about
65 percent of the student body is on some form
of ﬁnancial aid. They do not release what type of
aid students are receiving, however, so that only
provides some reﬂection of what percentage of the
student body is affected‘ by this new policy.

The government is not preoccupied by univer-
sity infractions. If a student is cited on campus
for any type of drug violation, it is still handle in-
ternally in compliance with Virginia and federal
laws. The university is not required to report these
violations on behalf of the recipient of federal ﬁ-
nancial aid to the body that oversees it.

The only type of drug violation that activates
this policy is a court conviction of a drug posses-
sion or dealing charge. In this situation a student
is likely to lose one year of federal ﬁnancial aid
for possessing and two for dealing, with additional
time padded on for secondary violations.

Take heart, however, because even if a W&L
student ﬁnds himself or herself in this predica-
ment, it is possible to receive federal ﬁnancial aid
again before the one-year term is up. With suc-
cessful completion of a Title IV drug rehabilita-
tion program and by successfully passing two un-
announced drug tests, a student can again receive
aid from the government.

There is no new university equivalent for with-
holding aid to drug users. The university has its
own policies in place with regards to the strike
system when it comes to drug violations on cam-
pus. Even so, most publications about problems
on campus almost never deal with drugs, most
likely because beside the occasional dorm bust
drug problems are not very prevalent on campus.

Associate Dean Brandon Dotson does not fore-
see this new policy being a problem for W&L stu-
dents.. In fact, in his four-year tenure at the univer-
sity there has not been a single conviction in court
of a W&L student with regards to drugs. He sees
the policy as the federal government “taking a pro-
active step to curtail drug usage among students.”

In the fateful war on drugs this is just another
non-issue in the way of combating the real dangers
among drug usage in the country. For W&L stu-
dents, however, whether on federal ﬁnancial aid or
not this new policy should not be anything more
than another email in the inbox.

Goodbye, University Scholars?

After undergoing academic review last winter term, the program may be disbanded

By Mary Huerster
STAFF WRITER

The University Scholars program,
an academic honors program within
the Washington and Lee community,
may be discontinued in its_present
form in the upcoming academic year.

A review process was initiated
last winter term, and while the ofﬁ—
cial ﬁndings of the committee (four
faculty members chaired by Profes-
sor William of the Physics Depart-
ment) have not yet been released, the
report is expected within the next few
weeks.

There is a sufﬁcient likelihood
that it will be disbanded, but Dean of
the College Hank Dobin has assured
current Scholars that they will be able

'to graduate with University Scholars

honors even if the program is phased
out before that time, to which end he
has offered to serve as their advisor.

Dobin explained that the program
came under review during winter
term of last year as part of a routine
process to which all academic pro-
grams are periodically subjected.

Such reviews have essentially a
dual purpose: to ascertain whether or
not a program still fulﬁlls its origi-
nal purposes and goals, and whether
or not those goals are still relevant
given changes that have taken place
in the University since the program’s
founding.

In the case of the University
Scholars, this was in 1984.

These goals, as identiﬁed in the
University Scholars constitution, are
to “encourage active rather than pas-
sive forms of learning, to emphasize
interdisciplinary studies, and to facil-
itate opportunity for discourse among
our most prepared students.”

Current University Scholars make
it clear that the program is, as far as
they are concerned, more than fulﬁll-
ing its objectives. Senior Emily Coyle,
who was featured in last week’s edi-

tion of the Ring-tum Phi for the sex-
ual assault prevention workshop she
designed via the University Scholars
Program, gave an example from her
own experience. ‘

“The University Scholars program
has taught me that the best way to ap-
proach a question is from a variety
of angles,” she said. “[It] was what
I learned in [a University Scholars
class] that will impact the rest of my
career.

thesis or capstone project required for
graduation from the Program.

O’Brien mentioned that the Uni-
versity Scholars program takes care
to seek out students willing to com-
plete all aspects of the program dur-
ing their recruitment process.

However, he said, even among
this self-selected group many ﬁnd
themselves too busy or otherwise re-
luctant to devote the time necessary
to this major undertaking.

“The University Scholars program has taught me

that the best way to approach a question is from a

variety of angles... Whatl learned in [a University

Scholars class] will impact the rest of my career. ’

EMILY COYLE, senlor University Scholar

“I am presently applying to de-
velopmental psychology phD pro-
grams, in large part because of an
interest sparked in me by a Univer-
sity Scholars anthropology course
my sophomore year. If that does not
embody the 1I‘llSSl011 of the University
Scholars program, I’m not sure what
does.”

One signiﬁcant concern about the
program, however, is itslow comple-
tion rate. Dobin mentioned that this
was a serious issue the faculty coin-
mittee came upon during the review
process.

According to University Scholars
President Elliott O’Brien, the schol-
ars themselves had been aware of and
concerned about the low completion
rate well before the review board.
Both he and Coyle suggested that the
main reason for this was the senior

Another troubling issue for mem-
bers of the program—though not
necessarily for the review committee
——has been its small size, which is a
double-edged sword.

While it allows for a closer feeling
of community than would otherwise
be possible, the program’s conse-
quent exclusivity is an unfortunate
side effect,

O’Brien said that one of the most
difﬁcult responsibilities of his role as
president is serving on the student-
run committee for admission into the
program. Out of about 200 students
(almost half a graduating class) with
the minimum qualifying GPA of 3.5,
he said, the program can take approx-
imately forty.

Harder still is the realization that
some students who do not meet the
GPA requirement would nevertheless

have been worthy additions to the

. program.

O’Brien remembered in particu-
lar a student who was not invited to
apply because a difﬁcult transition
to college had lowered his GPA, but
went on to become one of the most
successful students in his class.

Non-University Scholars are free
to take UNIV-designated classes
(classes approved for University
Scholars credit), but are not truly part
of the program community.

The main objection of the faculty
review board, however, was that as
W&L has grown as an institution
since 1984, the program has become
increasingly less necessary.

“Developments over time-such
as the creation of many interdisci-
plinary programs and the newer First-
Year Seminar program, a much ex-
panded and more varied curriculum
across the departments and programs,
and the [many] new and innovative
courses being designed for the new
spring term fulﬁll many of those
original goals,” said Dobin.

Dobin was very clear that, no
matter what the future of the Program
assuch, the University will continue
to support its goals of interdisciplin-
my study and “fostering a sense of
intellectual community.”

Local correctional center closed

Budget cuts cause loss of jobs, relocation of juveniles and costs W&L an outreach program

By Vergll Parson
s TA F F w R IT E R

The closing of Natural Bridge
Juvenile Correctional Center will
cost Rockbridge county a hundred
jobs, relocate dozens of kids to much
harsher facilities and lose Washing-
ton and Lee a fruitful outreach.

In an attempt to make up a budget
shortfall of 1.35 billion dollars, Gov.
Tim Kaine’s ofﬁce released a plan de-
tailing cuts and belt-tightening mea-
sures. Among these is the closing of
Natural Bridge Juvenile Correctional
Center (NBJCC). The plan states that
savings will total 1.2 million dollars
and result in 68 layoffs.

Bridge, the jobs lost will total 101.
This blow comes to an area already
hit severely by the current economic
downturn. The county stands to lose
more than the state stands to gain.

By all accounts, Natural Bridge
has one of the lowest rates of recidi-
vism. The facility, the only fenceless
correctional center in the area, acts
as the reward for good behavior and
a clearer glimpse of what life on the
outside will be like.

“I worry about what will happen
to many of the residents when they
are transferred to more high-secu-

“Natural Bridge Juvenile Correctional Center had

a great staff and did a lot of work to insure that resi-

dents never re—entered the system. Once this facility

is gone, I wonder who is going to step up and offer

opportunities for youth who truly want to reform. ’

ERIC HAMSCHER, junior and former tutor at NBJCC

However, the Rockbridge County
Board of Supervisors issued a state-
ment pointing out that the staff at NB-
ICC won’t be the only ones affected.
When including the auxiliary agen-
cies that provide services to Natural

rity facilities,” said W&L junior Eric
Hamscher, who tutored at NBJCC. “I
don’t think that they will get as much
help with pursuing schoolwork and
other activities that help reduce the
risk of re-offending upon being re-

leased.”

A currentresident of NBJ CC who
is working with Campus Kitchen
echoed Hamscher’s statement, say-
ing, “I don’t understand anything
about what they’re doing.” He said
the program shows what life outside
the system is like and then “[they]
pull it all away.” -

Most of the kids at NBJCC have
spent time at other facilities. Natural
Bridge works to maintain an atmo-
sphere far removed from the gangs
and violence of those other correc-
tional facilities; The young man men-
tioned above recounted being called
into an assembly on September 8 and
listening as correctional oﬂicers in-
formed the populace that they would
all be leaving in a few weeks.

Many consider the closing of
NBJCC a bad idea because NBJCC
makes a difference. Natural Bridge
has a program in which it sends
residents out to work at various jobs
around the county. It has sent two
interns to W&L’s Campus Kitchen.
Both of these young men plan on
coming back to Lexington in the fu-
ture.

Campus Kitchen has been very
beneﬁcial, both in providing thou-
sands of pounds of food to the Rock-
bridge area and introducing these two
young men to rewarding, fulﬁlling

work.

“This is one of the best things I
could’ve done,” said the young man
mentioned above. “They could’ve
put me in McDonald’s. I’m just wait-
ing 69 days, and then I come back
here.” ,

W&L did its part as well in help-
ing the NBJCC. The Bonner Leaders
program routinely sent students to tu-
tor in SAT, ACT, or GED prep, and
with class work.

One of the NBJCC’s key tools is
education~or, in their words, “to
provide a full range of services for
all wards to better prepare them for
their return to high school, college or
employment.”

Apart from the extent of the eco-
nomic detriment Rockbridge County
will suffer, one has to wonder what
will become of the population of
Virginia juvenile offenders who will
now sink back into the system.

As Hamscher said, “NBJCC had
a great staff and did a lot of work
to insure that residents never re—en-
tered the system. Once this facility is
gone, I wonder who’s going to step
up and offer opportunities for youth
who truly want to reform. In fact, I
worry that no one will be able to ﬁll
that void.”

Learning to live with the women’s rugby team

As a new and surprisingly succ

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

I have to start with a dis-
claimer. Yes, I am a member of
the rugby team, and, yes, I am
inherently biased towards this
subject matter.

However, it’s late September,
which means the fourth ﬂoor of
Graham-Lees hasn’t been men-
tioned nearly enough to be noto-
rious yet.

Also, the school has blocked

at the end of Spring Term last
year, and I was not only sur-
prised by the turnout, but rather
impressed.

On only ‘a couple of weeks
notice, the girls already seemed
ready to ﬁeld a team. But again,
I’m talking aboutVMI. That is to
be expected. I mean, these girls
enjoy shooting guns at targets in
the woods. Why wouldn’t they

guys from the Michael Jordan
movie you saw when you were
six.

The girls I imagined would be
oversized, probably have about
four too many piercings, and
would threaten to take my lunch
money if I did not get out of their
way. Basically, I thought they
would be the bench of a WNBA
basketball team.

How many other clubs here were anywhere close to having this kind

of success when they started? Can the Ultimate Frisbee team, a club

with a much longer history, boast this kind of schedule and stability?
 

the CoIlegeACB website (“pend-
ing an internal investigation,”
right...), so I don’t exactly have
anything juicy enough to ap-
ply to our campus at this given

. time. Instead, I am going to write

something that I want to write
about.

At the end of last Spring, VMI
decided to add a women’s rugby
team to their club repertoire. This
made plenty of sense for two rea-
sons: it helps fulﬁll their Title IX
requirements, and the girls who
willingly attend VMI without
playing a varsity sport probably
feel ready to hit someone.

I saw the girls’ team practice

enjoy beating the crap out of
other girls?

Before school started, the
W&L Rugby coach, Tom Lovell,
talked about trying to recruit
some girls to join in with the
VMI women’s rugby team. I,
like most of the other guys who
I talked to, responded by saying,
“Look, I’m down with the whole
Women’s Lib thing, but you will
never get any girl here to play
rugby. Period.”

When I think of women’s
rugby, I tend to imagine the
Monstars from “Space Jam.” For

' those of you with lives, those
were the animated monster bad

The perception I had of most
women at W&L was pretty much
the polar opposite of my percep-
tion of women’s rugby players.

Because I am deathly afraid
of getting tarred and feathered
by the Women’s Studies depart-
ment, let me say from the onset

that both these preconceptions

are false, and I have since seen
the error in my ways.

Anyway, I thought that girls at
W&L would neither want to hit
each other, nor would they want
to get too dirty. Obviously, these
preconceptions were blatantly
false, which is readily apparent to

I anyone who has attended the sto-

ried powder-puff football games
played every Spring Term.

At club sign ups in early Sep-
tember, I was stunned to see how
many girls stopped by the rugby
table and signed up to play.

For every guy making sure
his boys saw him sign up, there
was a girl right there behind him,

‘pen in hand.

Fine, I thought, there were
girls with too much time on their
hands, and they thought it’d be
cute to try a club sport. Or may-
be they saw some dashing young

rugby player who they read

about in the school newspaper
and thought that by signing up,
they would have a chance to win
his affections. Or maybe I was
completely wrong about those
last two assumptions.

With the astonishing number
of signups for the women’s rugby
team, there were enough players
to ﬁeld an entirely seperate team
for W&L, instead of just adding
to the VMI women’s roster.

On the ﬁrst day of practice,
more than 15 girls showed up
ready to play. Since they started
practicing about a week ago, not
only has their attendance been
outstanding, but their dedication
to practice has been also been
commendable.

When most of the men’s
players, including myself, are
bent over trying to catch their

‘women’s

collective breath and regretting
that seventh Natty from the night
before, the girls are effortlessly
running Indian sprints around
the ﬁeld.

The team is now large enough
to try and enter into two major
tournaments in the spring, and it
looks like they can not only enter
but also do quite well, despite the
fact that none of them have ever
played rugby before.

Being able to ﬁeld a team with
no previous experience and only
a couple of months of practice
before a national tournament?
Even Emilio Estevez had Charlie
Conway when he coached Dis-
trict Five to a championship over
the Hawks. And, yes, that is two
15-year-old kids’ movie refer-
ences and counting so far.

But here’s the important thing
about the advent of the W&L
rugby team. They
should not be revered for be-
ing brave, strong, courageous,
dangerous or any other speciﬁc
adjective. This is not WUSA or
the WNBA or even “A League
of Their Own.” They are not the
sorority in “The House Bunny”
bravely ﬁghting for attention
against the evil blondes.

In fact, their accomplishment
isn’t really movie quality. Lud-
acris is not going to narrate their
documentary, as he did with the
documentary “The Heart of the

essful club on campus, the W&L women is rugby team has deﬁed expectations

Game.”

They have achieved a feat
much_more important and spec-
tacular.

They have created a fully ca-
pable sports team out of thin air.

They have a reliable practice
schedule, a consistent turnout
and an unparalleled enthusiasm
for the game. How many other
clubs here were anywhere close
to having this kind of success
when they started? Can the U1-
timate Frisbee team, a club with
a much longer history, boast this
kind of schedule and stability?

These girls aren’t by any
means the Monstars. I would go
on further describing how dif-
ferent they really are physically
from the Monstars, but my law-
yers advise me to do otherwise.

These are just normal col-
lege students forming a stable,
attended club, and that is their
true accomplishment. They have
altered my and others’ miscon-
ceptions of the sport not through
conferences, rallies, O-Week en-
lightenment sessions or anything
else like that.

Instead, the women’s rugby
club triumphed in the most bor-
ing and unheralded way pos-
sible.

They signed up.

The loss of the barrier in the BDG
Quad is an absolute travesty

A first—year shares his outrage at the demolition of the ﬂowered barrier

By Keaton Fletcher
c o L o M N I sr

If you have been anywhere
near the quad within the past
week, you may have noticed
a rather troublesome physical
change on our campus.

Earlier this week, many liv-
ing in Gilliam and Davis dormi-
tories woke up to the sound of a
bulldozer in the Quad knocking
down the small triangular barrier
containing an enjoyable flower-
ing bush.

Many students are at a loss
as to why this ideal sitting place
was demolished without no-
tice, at least for the most part.
I think it safe to assume that
the bush was not worth water-
ing, especially in comparison to
grass. Even so, Generals are not
mourning the loss of the plant
but rather the seating area.

Where else are we supposed

to sit and explain to our parents
that no, we are not getting in too
much trouble?

Where are we supposed to sit
and wait for our select friends
who have cars to come pick us
up?

Some might say that the two
benches provided on the side
walk are clearly ideal seating,
especially compared to a decrep-
it brick wall. But there are two
main problems that are already
noticeable about the new lack of
seating.

The ﬁrst problem is just that:
lack of seating. The other issue
is the proximity to the street.
Few students desire to sit next
to the street while having an in-
timate conversation or while try-
ing to arrange an interview for
an internship.

The semi-isolated feeling
that the old brick wall seating
provided was much preferable.

But, instead of reminiscing
in the years (or in ﬁrst-years’
cases weeks) gone by with ideal
seating in the quad, perhaps we
should look toward the future.

—Maybe the new triangle of
grass that has been planted, once
it takes root, could be host to
a new set of benches for more
comfortable and intimate seat-
ing. Or perhaps we could have
a more natural themed seating,
i.e., rocks or logs. ,

This _might be an idealistic
view of some wide-eyed fresh-
man, but isn’t this our campus?

If we care enough about the
loss of seating we should bring
this to the attention of admin-
istration. We have shown the

power of students in years prior
by making changes, such as a
shift toward local produce and
the institution of Campus Kitch-
ens.

If there is enough interest in
bringing change about on this
campus, we have the power to
do it.

Now, Generals, the only
question is having to sit on the
steps of Gilliam to simply have a
conversation awkward enough?
Do you feel so uneasy sitting
alone on a bench by the street at
midnight that you feel the need
to request a change?

If so, take control of your
situation and come up with an
incentive for administration to
give you what you want.

I Facebook, Twitter and the future of communication

F acebook and Twitter are now powerful entities in the Internet universe, but Jonathan Salm questions their legitimacy

By Jonathan Salm
STAFF‘ WRITER

With the rise of the social net-
work and interconnectivity on
the internet, a number of institu-
tions have come to dominate how
people communicate.

Friendster, MySpace and
Facebook all launched in suc-
cessive years from 2002 to 2004,
and the Internet was transformed
from a largely unorganized col-
lection of people, ideas and ar-
ticles to an interrelated forum
where these people, ideas and
articles could all be linked to-
gether.

Coupled with the rise of per-
sonal blogs, as well as websites
such as Wikipedia and Youtube,
the Internet entered its second
era formally beginning after the
dot-com bubble burst. The term
Web 2.0 was coined, ushering in
the era of the interconnected in-
ternet.

While both Friendster and
MySpace rose and fell in popu-
larity sequentially, Facebook
has come to dominate the social
networking scene, boasting over
200 million users——1argely due to
a clean, uncluttered interface, the
ability to easily share photos and
comments and the recently added
chat feature.

One of Facebook’s marquee

features is the ability to publish
a ‘status’ for all friends to see.
This status is a short message
that appears at the top of a user’s
page. What began as a question
of “What are you doing?” now
reads, “What’s on your mind?”
Basically, the status is a 160-
character micro-blog.

While yes, I do use Facebook,
and yes, I do occasionally pub-

I believe the Facebook status to
be more trouble than it’s worth.

Facebook’s strengths lie in
its innovative photo tagging fea-
ture as well as its ease in adding
friends. Both of these features
were marquees of the website

’when it ﬁrst launched. Being

able to connect with hundreds
(and thousands, for some) of
people while also being able to
cull through years of online pho-
tos lies within the heart of the
F acebook’s convenience.

HoweverubiquitousFacebook
is among students, young adults,
and recently—gasp—adults and
professionals, its status feature
invites a critical existential ex-
amination. Can 160 characters,
the same amount allowed in
one text message, truly describe
someone’s life?

I ﬁnd Facebook statuses to
be uninteresting, often point-

less, and somewhat disturbing.
When I log on to F acebook, I
don’t particularly care to know

The essential issue with F ace-
book statuses has carried over
into the most recent, and possibly
most pointless way people com-

I had a stark realization of how my Facebook per-
sona may make me appear to others one day in Oc-
tober of 2005. I was a sophomore at American Uni-
versity in Washington, DC. I was interviewing for an
internship at a prestigious DC think tank.

The lead interviewer took out a thin manila folder
and opened it. Inside I could see my application ma-
terials, writing sample, resume, et cetera. Then she
turned the pages over and I was horriﬁed at what she
had in her hand: a printed out copy of my Facebook

so of each day to 140 characters,
I refuse to be conﬁned to such a
limited paradigm.

Despite my aversion to Twit-
ter, it seems that it is here to
stay.

In fact, it is rapidly climb-
ing the social networking ech-
elon, intimidating Facebook
with its stripped—down simplic-
ity and minimalism. (Note that
Facebook’s own simplicity and
minimalism contributed to its
rise over rivals Friendster and
Myspace.)

From February 2008 to 2009,
Twitter’s user base grew over
1300 percent, whereas Face-
book’s grew nearly 230 percent.
While this may be attributed to
Twitter’s novelty and innovation
or simply the fact that Web 2.0ers
tend to gravitate to the newest
and hippest trends, it is nonethe-
less a poignant fact.

Just this week, Facebook
rolled out two new features in
response to Twitter’s rise. Face-
book’s own @ command mirrors
Twitter’s reply command (they
both even use the @ symbol).
Facebook also launched a new
“lite” version of the site meant for
emerging markets and those with
slower Internet connections.

Both social networks are im-
mensely popular, and because of

here to stay.

If Friendster and MySpace are
any example, each network has a
niche it can thrive on. Friendster
has the Asian market cornered,
and MySpace is still tops for mu-
sic.

Despite my aversion to the
Facebook status and Twitter as
a whole, I remain yet another
connected being—if only via
Facebook. What exactly does
this mean about the future of
online social networking, and
more broadly, communication as
a whole?

It seems that brief, bite-sized
communication is the way of the
future. This shift from face—to-
face communication to quicker
and more effective means is
nothing new.

Over the past hundred and
ﬁfty years, communication has
evolved from telegrams to wired
telephones to wireless telephones
to cell phones to email and ﬁnally
to online social networks such as
Facebook and Twitter.

This transformation repre-
sents a prime example of social
Darwinism—adapt or die out.

March of Dimes and local literacy projects.

Pi Beta Phi sorority and Phi Beta
Sigma fraternity challenged the
endurance of dancers Friday
night at their 3rd Annual Dance-
A-Thon in Elrod Commons.
Members of these two Greek
organizations sold tickets all over

for the March of Dimes and local
literacy efforts.

Zaq Lawal and Samara Fran-
cisco organized the event, and
said that they surpassed their goal
of raising $2,000 for these chari-
ties. Half of the money raised

of babies. In the past, the other
half has gone to buying books
for local elementary schools.

To be the champion, one must
dance all night long, and the last
person dancing is the winner. As
participants moved on the dance

ﬂoor, different styles of dances
came alive, while limbs became
weak.

“The only type of dancing not
allowed is ‘no dancing,”’ said
Lawal, Phi Beta Sigma presi-
dent.

All types of music were
played throughout the night;
however, the organizations de-
cided to put a special emphasis
on playing music from popu-
lar movies, dubbing the night’s
theme “Dancing with the Stars.”

According to Lawal, more
than 100 people came to the
event, making it a huge success
and the most proﬁtable dance-a-
thon yet.

Junior Susan Taylor, who
participated, said that the music
made the night.

“My favorite part was doing
the macarena to a Lady GaGa
song for entertainment,” said
Taylor.

First-place winner Sir—Koven
Glover and second-place winner
Sarah Kim both received a Fancy
Dress ticket, a combined value of
$120. The two danced from 8:00
Friday night to 5:30 Saturday
morning.

The idea of the dance-a-thon
began in 2007 when the two
groups wanted to do a fun, in-
novative fundraiser together.

included a T-shirt and a pair of

Annual University day of
service kicks of on Saturday

By Stephanie Hardlman
ARTS & LIFE EDITOR

This weekend is the opportuni-
ty to give back to the community
students call home for four years.

Each year, dozens of students
spend a Saturday doing good for
the Rockbridge area and keeping
the memory of Jonathan Nabors
‘02 alive.

Students can sign up individu-
ally or in teams, and are assigned
a service project for the day.

“It’s a really great way to
show that our campus is devoted
to the community and that we're
not trapped in this W&L bubble,”
said Nabors Service League chair
Samara Francisco. “Rockbridge
County is a place we consider our
home, too.”

Nabors Service League mem-
bers spent last week in Elrod
Commons encouraging students
to sign up for the event or even
take the initiative to become a
team leader and recruit students
themselves.

Francisco, a senior, said this
year’s projects include clearing
trails at Boxerwood Gardens, re-
shelving books at the local library,
picking trash and debris at Panther
Falls and painting-related projects
throughout the county.

Team leader Christina Torres,
a junior, decided to ﬁeld a team
of Heinz Scholars, high-achiev-
ing minority students who receive
scholarships to rise above difficult
ﬁnancial circumstances.

Torres and her ﬁve teammates
are committed to completing two
group community service activi-
ties as part of their relationship
with Heinz.

“We've been given a great
opportunity and we need to give
back in some way,” Torres said.

About 135 students are signed
up now, Francisco said, and she
hopes more will choose to join the
cause this week. Many fraterni-
ties, sororities, athletic teams and
organizations have already orga-
nized volunteer teams.

Nabors Service League was
formed by the friends of Jonathan

Nabors in 1999. Nabors, a fresh-
man, and his sister were driving
back to Lexington from their home
in Birmingham, Ala., after winter
break when they were killed in a
car accident on I-81.

Nabors Service Day began that
year in his memory and, with the
help of his friends, became a stu-
dent volunteer organization that
works year-round to provide vol-
unteers.

“Sometimes you just have to
meet the person to understand
how exceptional he or she is,”
Nabors Service League organiz-
er Clairbome Taylor ’O2 wrote
upon the founding of the group.
“Jonathan’s love for this Univer-
sity and the Lexington community
was evident in the way he carried
himself. His presence truly bright-
ened a room and brought smiles to
people’s faces.”

Nabors’s parents return to Lex-
ington each year for the day of
service and are still active in the
University community.

“lt’s how the family has been
able to deal with their son's . ath
and still have a relationship with
the school,” Francisco said. “And
it reminds the University of the
greater point of the organization.”

Saturday at l p.m., the par-
ticipants will gather on Cannan
Green to hear the Nabors family
speak. After departing for their
individual projects, teams will
work until about 5 p.m and return
to campus for a picnic dinner and
reﬂection on the day.

The next Nabors Service
League event will be a Hallow-
een carnival on Oct. 29 that is
co-sponsored with the Lexington
Chamber of Commerce. It will
include pumpkin and face paint-
ing, games and candy for local
children.

Those interested in participat-
ing in Nabors Service Day can
register online at http://go.wlu.
edu/nabors or contact Samara
Francisco.

Commons living room.
also sold.

Lawal said he hopes, in the
future, for increased participa-
tion so it is even more fun. He
foresees more rafﬂe prizes and a
larger location, such as the gym
or the pavilion.

Lawal said that the best part

of organizing this fundraiser was
“seeing all the planning and hard
work come to fruition and know-
ing that people are having a great
time and enjoying themselves.”

Generals give fall preview in lax classic

The Washington and L_ee Men is Lacrosse team will compete against VMI in the 23rd Annual Lee—Jackson Lacrosse Classic .

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

The Generals’ lacrosse sticks have
been patiently waiting out the summer

in closets and gym bags. But now it’s

time for fall ball and those sticks, eager
for the taste of new turf and the jolt of
a well-placed check, are ready to prove
they’re worth their aluminum.

The. Washington and Lee men’s la-

_crosse team will compete against the

Virginia Military Institute in the 23rd
Annual Lee-Jackson Lacrosse Classic
this Friday at 7:30 pm. on Wilson Field.

The game will mark the ﬁrst contest 0

for the Generals since their loss to Get-

tysburg in the NCAA tournament last

spring put an end to their l6-4 season.
The storied match—up against Division I
VMI has traditionally been held in the
spring, but three years ago, organizers

moved the event to the fall.

“It’s very difﬁcult to ﬁnd time to
schedule a game like this in the spring,”
said W&L head coach Gene McCabe.
“Now it can be a stand-alone event. We
can really build it up in the community
and have a nice long—standing rivalry.”

Admission to the game is free, but

" the schools will be hosting a 50-50 rafﬂe

with all proceeds going directly to sup-
port youth lacrosse in the area.

“It’s just a great thing to have for the
community,” McCabe said. “It’s a great
way to give back to the city of Lexing-
ton.”

And it’s a way of giving back that the
players enjoy.

“I interned this summer for a camp
in the area and I had an awesome time,”

said senior captain defender Tyler Smith.
“I was coaching kids from the Lexing-
ton and Roanoke area so I probably met
a lot of these kids. It’s deﬁnitely some-
thing that’s important for us.”

As far as a long-standing rivalry goes,
it may not be much of a contest. In the
23 years that the Classic has been held,
the Generals have lost only twice to the
Cadets. Last year, W&L took home the
Classic with a 14-8 victory.

“We always enjoy playing [VMI] a
lot,” Smith said. “It’s cool to be compet-
itive with a Division I team. But I think
fall practices have been going well and
we’re all pretty conﬁdent about it. I just
hope we play our best and then I think
we’ll win.”

But while the Cadets may not be the

a

Generals’ biggest foe of the year, the
game will be a strong preview of what
Generals’ fans can expect come. spring.
Smith, named to the All-ODAC Con-
ference team last year, will be back on
defense. Fellow captain senior attack
Will Keigler will be looking to continue
to build the scoring record that earned
him All-American Honorable Mention
last year and the proud title of sixth-

' leading scorer in the nation. Senior mid-

ﬁelder Kevin Feeney, who contributed
14 goals and two assists last year, will
also be returning for the Generals.

But the game is also an exhibition for
the new faces hoping to join the Gener-
als in the spring.

“We don’t use this game to decide
who’s on the team,” McCabe said. “But

Women’ssoccer falls to No:11 ranked foe

anyone who ’s on our roster for this game
has a really good chance.”

The game takes" place over VMI’s
homecoming weekend, but McCabe
said he hoped the W&L crowd would be
the one who screamed the loudest.

“VMI is bound to have a great crowd
so we need as many students and faculty
and staff as we can,” he said. “It would
be great to have a great W&L crowd
there to lead us to victory over VMI.”

The Lady Generals defeated Hollins University, but fell to Messiah College over the weekend to drop to 5-]

By Llzz Dye
smrr warren

The Washington and Lee women’s
soccer team lost its perfect record, go-
ing 1-1 for the week with a 6-0 victory
over Hollins University and a 5-0 loss
to No. 1 Messiah College. Ranked third
in the 2009 ODAC preseason poll, the
Generals are now 5-1 and 2-0 in ODAC
conference play.

In the Wednesday match-up against
Hollins, junior Laura Yungmeyer scored
the ﬁrst and only ﬁrst-half goal in the
34th minute off an assist from sopho-
more Allie Espina. The Generals picked
it up the second half and put ﬁve goals

in the net.

Senior midﬁelder Roz Klann scored
in the 52nd minute off an assist from
sophomore forward Kat Barnes. Barnes
contributed a goal of her own in the 56th
minute off an assist" from midﬁelder
Hannah Sackﬁeld. Senior midﬁelder
Maggie Sutherland scored the fourth
goal for the Generals in the 62nd minute
off another assist from Sackﬁeld. First-
year midﬁelder Ainsley Daigle contin-
ued her strong play for the Generals
and closed out the game with two more
goals. The ﬁrst came off a comer kick in

the 78th minute and the second was an
unassisted goal in the 88th minute.
Sophomore goalie Emily Leary
played all 90 minutes with two saves.
The Generals knew the Saturday
match-up against Messiah would be a
challenge. Unfortunately, the Generals
were unable to pull out a win. The 5-0
loss was a hard blow to the team, but
the players said it was deﬁnitely a good
experience to play against the 2008 Na-
tional Champions.
“We played well for the ﬁrst half,
but let off for 20 minutes in the second,

79

and that’s when they scored their goals,
said sophomore forward Anne Masich.

“We beat Hollins, but we have been
playing very inconsistently this week,”

added sophomore defender Corinne.

Smith. “We need to be strong all 90
minutes of the game in order to continue
to win. We’ve got to take a deep breath
and refocus to beat our tough opponents
coming up.” .

The Generals will need to put in some
extra work before they take on the tough
opponents coming up on their schedule.
The Generals face No. 1 ranked and

2007-2008 ODAC champions Lynch-
burg College on October 10.

' “We need to defend as a team and
capitalize on the opportunities that we
get when we play them because they are
a really good team,” Smith said.

The Generals will look to work
on building up their game in their
next match-up at Roanoke College on
Wednesday.

Making it through prison in the NFL

Columnist Lee T ackett compares the situations of NFL stars Michael Vick and Plaxico Burress

By Lee Tackett
sun COLUMNIST

Two NFL stars have seen their lives
head in different directions over the past
two years. Poised to suit up for his ﬁrst
regular season game since serving time
in prison for dog ﬁghting, Michael Vick
seems to have turned his life around.
But while Vick gets set to run through

the tunnel when his new team, the Phil- .

adelphia Eagles, square off against the
Kansas City Chiefs, Plaxico Burress
will be sitting in a cell in the maximum
security prison of Rikers Island, outside
of New York City.

Admittedly, Burress made a mistake
by carrying a gun with him the night
he accidentally shot himself in the leg.
Burress was rushed to the hospital, and

made a full recovery from the injuries,
but turned himself in to authorities the
following week. A warrant was issued
for his arrest, not because the hospital
reported the shooting to the authorities,
but because the police department saw
the television coverage of the incident.
The mayor of New York City, Michael
Bloomberg, urged for Burress to be
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the
law and Burress quickly found himself
in a difﬁcult situation.

' Throughout his career, Burress has
never been exempt from criticism for his
off-ﬁeld actions. He has two restraining
orders issued against him for domestic
disturbances, both of which were even-

tually dropped. For most, Burress’s re-
cent actions were seen as a clear lapse
in judgment, but not necessarily a truly
criminal act. But today, Burress ﬁnds
himself in a cell next to some of the hard-
est criminals in New York City. Murder-
ers and drug dealers next to someone
who accidentally shot himself in the leg
doesn’t quite seem right. Burress wasn’t
a weapon-toting thug, but simply part of
a culture that sees many athletes carry
guns for “protection,” even if they rarely
think of using them.

Burress’s status as an NFL star clear-
ly worked against him in this case. The
New York City judicial,system made an
example of Burress by sentencing him

to two years in prison. Burress has made
the most of his difﬁcult situation, how-
ever. He hasn’t been making any excus-
es for his actions and has accepted his
punishment as best he can.

Michael Vick’s career has taken a
much better turn than Burress’s. Vick
will be on an NFL depth chart for the
ﬁrst time in two years this Sunday. Vick
had obvious issues before his prison
sentence. He was around the wrong type
of people, making the wrong type of de-
cisions at the height of his career. Vick
ﬁled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy while in
prison. He had irresponsibly squandered
the massive sums of the money he made
through his contracts and endorsements

and was left with virtually nothing. The
Eagles took a decided risk in signing
Vick, facing criticism from multiple ani-
mal rights organizations. But the Eagles
believe that Vick has turned a corner in
his life and greatly increased his level
of maturity.

While Vick may never be the star that
he was in Atlanta, his redemption proj-
ect can serve as motivation for Burress.
Maybe he, too, will make it through his
prison term and one day return to the
NFL.

Generals improve to 3-4 with wins over conference foes

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee ﬁeld hockey
team struggled to a 1-3 start, due in part to
some tough out-of-conference scheduling.
But “struggled” is not the way to describe
the Generals’ effort last week. W&L (3-
4, 2-1 ODAC) silenced a lot of doubters
with their performance against Lynchburg,
Randolph-Macon and Sweet Briar. The
Generals lost to Lynchburg, 3-2,'but rallied
to defeat both Randolph-Macon, 4-1, and
Sweet Briar, 5-2.

W&L played host_ to Lynchburg on
Wednesday and rose to the occasion, just
three days after a heartbreaking 3-2 over-
time loss to Catholic University. Lynchburg
arrived at the ﬁeld boasting a 5-2 record, a
four game winning streak versus W&L, a
No. 14 national ranking, and two attackers
(Jordan Warrington and Allie Weir) with
49 points scored between them.

The ladies in blue could have easily
packed their things and handed this game
to the Hornets. But the Generals went toe-
to-toe with their bitter rival.

Senior goalkeeper Caroline Habliston

V kept the game scoreless with some few

key saves. Finally, with less than two min-
utes left in the half, W&L caught a break.
Sophomore attacker Annie Stevenson
opened the scoring and shocked Lynchburg
with a goal from right in front of the cage.
First-year Chelsea Stevenson provided the
assist. The Stevenson connection gave the

Generals some momentum and much-
needed conﬁdence going into halftime
with a 1-0 lead.

But the Hornets came out buzzing to
start the second period and simply dom-
' inated play for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes.
The Hornets tied the score quickly with
an unassisted goal by Kristina Morris.
W&L called a timeout shortly after, and
answered the call once again to take the
lead 2-1. Sophomore Lindsey Edmonds
netted the goal this time on a beautiful
hustle play and cross-field pass from
Stevenson. \

The ﬁrst-year dynamo energized
the team once again, and W&L tried to
hang on for the win. With four minutes
left in the game, however, Lynchburg
broke the hearts of the Generals. War-
rington and Weir each scored goals with
four minutes and two minutes left in the
game respectively. Their goals secured
a come-from-behind 3-2 victory for
Lynchburg.

In a game where so many things
went right for the Generals, they were
outplayed only two minutes late in the
game, and it cost them.

“It was simply mental errors, and men-
tal errors lead to physical errors,” said head
coach Wendy Orrison about the end of the
game.

The Generals took to the field again two
days later for another conference match-up
against Randolph-Macon.

Senior captain Sallie Armstrong
opened the scoring just 30 seconds into
the game and Alex Caritis added two
more goals to close out the half. Ran.-
dolph-Macon got onto the score sheet
with a penalty stroke in the second
half, but ﬁrst-year Ann Burton Gerhardt
dashed any comeback hopes with an un-
assisted goal. The goal put the Generals
ahead for a 4-1 victory.

‘‘I am very pleased,” Orrison said.
“They had every right to be tired and
they weren’t. We had great team speed”.

The team then traveled to Sweet Briar
on Saturday and came back home with
another big win under their belts with a
5-2 victory over Sweet Briar.

After a scoreless ﬁrst half, the Gen-
erals’ exploded with ﬁve goals scored
by senior Steph Mansey (2), sophomore
Christina Benedetti, junior Jennie Nor-
cini and ﬁrst-year Katharine Price.

“We are getting a signiﬁcant fresh-
man contribution,” Orrison said of the
ﬁrst-years’ impact. “They are giving us
some big minutes.” .

The Generals’ next game is a home
match-up against Limestone on Friday.
Come out and support the team, and per-
haps witness history as Armstrong looks to
pass the school record with one more goal.
