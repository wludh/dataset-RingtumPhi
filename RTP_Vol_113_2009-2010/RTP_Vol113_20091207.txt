Students call on W&L community to contribute ideas on new policies and ideas to help end sexual assault on campus

By Eric Gehman
smrr warren

The Women’s and Gender

Studies department is holding‘

an open forum on sexual as-
sault policy reform this coming
Wednesday at 7:15 p.m. as part
of a project for WGS296A, the
Sexual Assault Prevention Work-
shop. They have also started a
new student group on campus
called END IT. which seeks to
end sexual assault at Washington
and Lee over the next 20 years.

Professor Melina Bell, who
developed the course with se-
nior Emily Coyle over last sum-
mer, said that the purpose of the
WGS296A course is to “not only
study the problem” of sexual as-
sault policy at W&L, but to “ﬁnd
some solutions and start a con-
versation about implementing
[them].”

Students are preparing for the
forum by studying “academic lit-
erature... addressing how, why,
and under what circumstances
rape and sexual assault occur,"
as well as surveys and studies
conducted locally by former and
current W&L undergrads about
the prevalence of sexual assault
within the W&L community.

Other members of the com-
munity, such as Project Horizon
director Judy Casteele, univer-
sity counselor Jennifer Sayre,
Dean of Students Dawn Wat-
kins, Sergeant Miles Kelly of the

Rockbridge County Sherriff’s
Ofﬁce and more visited the class
throughout the semester to help
the students gain a better un-
derstanding of the problem on
campus as they put together their
own ideas and opinions about
reforming policy and changing
culture at W&L.

Dr. Bell hopes that the fo-
rum can “provide information
about the nature and prevalence
of sexual assault  on college
campuses, and at W&L in par-
ticular.”

Her students will present dif-
ferent proposals to reform school
policy for sexual assault with
the hope that those in attendance
will offer their own opinions and
suggestions as part of an ongoing
dialogue within the community
about how to end sexual assault
at W&L.

Bell wants “to get some
good ideas from the commu-
nity... about how to_improve or
implement [policy recommenda-
tions].” The group also hopes to
“raise awareness... and connect
with supporters who might be
able to work with them as they
work to end sexual assault at
W&L,” according to Bell.

The class has already met
with the Student Faculty Hearing
Board Ad-Hoc Review commit-
tee and discussed ways to im-

prove the adjudication of sexual
assault at W&L, but Bell noted
that the forum will be the ﬁrst
time the class presents a uni-
ﬁed set of proposals for both the
SFHB and the administration.
She hopes to submit the class’s
proposals to the Student Affairs
Committee once the class has re-
ceived some feedback and input

strategies, which is incredibly
energizing.” Coyle herself pro-
posed that the course be offered
this year, and described herself
as “thrilled” that other students
signed up to join her cause.

The class, comprised of all fe-
male students, has members from
all 6 NPC sororities, two athletic
teams, the Captains Council,

merit for sexual assault preven-
tion and policy reform.

As a part of the class, a rep-
resentative from the national
organization Students Active for
Ending Rape (SAFER) visited
campus and hosted a training
seminar on political action and
sexual assault prevention on col-
lege campuses.

“We ’re on the brink ofdiscussing concrete prevention strategies,

. which is incredibly energizing. ...It is only with broad community

support that we have "any chance of changing the prevalence of

1

sexual assualt here. ’

EMILY COYLE, senior

from the community forum.

Coyle urged the importance
of “spreading the dialogue [about
sexual assault] to all demograph-
ics at Washington and Lee.”

“Sexual assault isn’t simply
a women’s issue,” she said, “and
this will take a community-wide
effort [to put an end to sexual as-
sault on campus.]”

Coyle called the class “a lot
of work, but very rewarding” and
believes that “we’re on the brink
of discussing concrete prevention

and more; the group represents a
wide variety of majors and many
other campus organizations.
Both Bell and Coyle felt that
while the class represented a
broad range of interests academi-
cally, politically and socially, the
lack _of male perspective caused
some difﬁculties as they work to
incorporate men into the move-

Other members from the
W&L community were invited
as well and the group decided
to coalesce into an organization
known as END IT. to continue
their efforts after the semester
ends.

Regarding the role of END IT.
in next week’s forum, Coyle said
that “it will come up, and we’ll
certainly pass around a sign-
up sheet for those interested in
getting involve. However, what
we’re presenting is really what

the class has found. At this point,
END IT. is an entity in itself and
I’d hate to represent what the
class is doing as the thoughts and
feelings of the whole organiza-
tion.”

Coyle said that the new group
is seeking to “extend member-
ship, especially among first
years, faculty and staff and male

students,” and “start to work

with other groups on campus
who might share similar inter-
ests in preventing sexual assault
at W&L.” She stressed, “it is
only with broad community sup-

port that we have any chance of

changing the prevalence of sexu-
al assault here.”

Calling in and speaking out

Student organizations team up to call representatives and voice opinions for (or against) contested Stupak amendment

By Eric Gehman
STAFF warren

A group of students orga-
nized by Voices for Choice, the
College Democrats and KEWL
spent their past Wednesday eve-
ning calling local representatives
to protest the hotly debated Stu-
pak Amendment to congressio-
nal healthcare reform.

The amendment, put forth by
Rep. Bart Stupak (D-MI) and
Rep. Joseph Pitts (R-PA), would
restrict the so-called “Public Op-
tion” government run-healthcare
program from covering abortion
procedures except in the case
of rape, incest, or danger to the
mother’s life. Plans purchased on
the healthcare “exchange” with
federal subsidies would also be
restricted from including cover-
age for elective abortion proce-
dures.

Democrats and pro-choice op-
ponents of the amendment point
out that while it would only le-
gally limit those who buy health
exchange on the federally sub-

sidized healthcare exchange or
those who elect to receive direct
coverage from the federal gov-
ernment, the economic repercus-
sions- of such a restriction would
cause private healthcare insur-
ers to drop coverage for elective
abortions as well, limiting wom-
en’s options for reproductive
choice through economic chan-
nels rather than legal channels.

Voices for Choice President
sophomore Hallie Janson said
she felt it “necessary that people
on campus get involved with
politics because we live in such
an insulated environment.”

She also had concerns that
this legislation went beyond a
simple disagreement in morality,
but rather that it “limits and leg-
islates women’s bodies.”

For her organization, the call-
in was a chance to promote a pro-
choice cause on campus and help
effect change at the federal level
for an issue her group members

are passionate about.

A recent George Washington
University study concluded that
“...the terms and impact of the
Amendment will work to defeat
the development of a supplemen-
tal coverage market for medical-
ly indicated abortions.”

The study also notes that “. ..
the House legislation contains
no direct economic incentive to
create such a market... because
supplemental coverage must
of necessity commingle funds
with basic coverage, the impact
of Stupak/Pitts on states’ abil-
ity to offer supplemental Medie-
aid coverage to women insured
through a subsidized exchange
plan is in doubt.”

Yet proponents of the amend-
ment argue that it merely seeks
to preserve the status quo with
respect to the usage of federal
funding for elective abortion pro-
cedures. The Hyde Amendment,
the current legislation barring the

use of Medicaid funding for elec-
tive abortion procedures, was the
template for the Stupak amend-
ment, according to its creator.
Representative Stupak sought to
maintain the government’s cur-
rent policy without allowing for
any new abortion legislation to
become a part of the healthcare
reform bill.

Students For Life president
senior Sarah Keckler comment-
ed on the call-in, expressing her
concern over the wording of or-
ganizer senior Summer Sterling’s
campus notice. According to Ke-
ckler, Sterling’s notice read that
“private insurance companies
would be prohibited from fund-
ing abortions.”

“That is not the case,” Keckler

said. “The amendment does not
prohibit funding. In fact if you
read it, you will ﬁnd that it em-
phasizes about ﬁve to six times
that [prohibiting private funding]
is what it’s not going to do.”

Keckler also expressed con-
cern over the unawareness that
surrounds the Stupak bill, citing
that she had trouble ﬁnding the
actual amendment online. How-
ever, Keckler mentioned that
Students For Life have plans in
the works for supporting aware-
ness and the bill itself.

“We would like to do a cam-
paign increasing the awareness
of the campaign,” she said. “The
problem is timing, though. We’d
like to do something in January,
seeing as that is a month that is a
big month for pro-life organiza-
tions, with events like March for
Life, etc. We just have to see ifit
will be relevant enough by then,
seeing as it’s backed-up in Con-
gress at the moment.”

Sterling, other members of
KEWL and members of the Col-
lege Democrats were unavailable
for interviewing.

Gift ideas that woﬂf get you in trouﬁe

Struggling to think of the perfect gift to buy your cherished ones?

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

The holiday season is already
upon us. Christmas Weekend is
already over, the Lexington holi-
day parade is next week and ﬁnals
start right after that.

Now, while you are most like-
ly spending most of your time left
at Washington and Lee studying
your brains out and worrying how
many points exactly it will take
for you to reach a passing grade
for each of your classes, you need
to remember that with the holiday
season comes presents, and now
that you’re an adult, you actually
have to buy some presents your-
self.

After doing some “intense
research” (otherwise known as
browsing the intemet during the
SEC Championship Game), I have
discovered all the perfect gifts for
each treasured person in your life.
But hey, maybe you don’t like my
idea for a gift, so I’ve also thrown
in what not to buy for each trea-
sured person in your life.

Why do I do this? Well, you’d
be surprised at the mistakes some
people make with their choices in
Christmas gifts. Nothing is more
awkward than seeing your mom
unwrap the Victoria’s Secret San-
ta lingerie while the whole family
watches. Trust me.

So, without further ado, here is
what to get and what not to get for
each person you might possibly
buy presents for:

Dad- The best gift a child can
give their father is a gift that si-
multaneously makes your dad feel
more like a man and beneﬁts your
life in some way. Using this meth-
od, the perfect gift for your dad
this Christmas is the Big Green
Egg. The Big Green Egg is a kind
of charcoal grill that was original-
ly used in ancient Japan and more
or less makes the perfect man
grill. Plus, now your dad’s burnt
steaks won’t taste too bad. Sure,
it costs about $500 or so, but you
love your dad, right?

The sure-ﬁre gift you don’t
want to give your dad is a letter
from Dean Dotson detailing how
you recently got a strike. Nothing
really ruins the spirit of family
love on the holidays like your dad
berating you for needing to talk

back to security while you were
wasted. A letter like that is best
saved until after New Year’s.

Mom- The best way to not
only earn a little extra love from
your mom over the holidays but
also to reassure her that you are
actually doing some work in Lex-
ington is to give her a new copy
of a book that you recently read
in either your History or Eng-
lish classes. That way, you can
talk about the book like you ac-
tually know something about it,
and even if you didn’t read the
book, you can simply regurgitate
the notes that you jotted down in
class. Just tell her that you saw
this book in the bookstore, and
“it just screamed you.” This move
will buy you a good amount of
love over the holidays.

If you’re pressed for time and
desperate for a present, please
do not buy your mom the new
Eminem album, “Reﬁll,” which
is released on Dec. 21. Although
he may have inspired you by get-
ting out of 8- mile, I have a hunch
that your mother probably doesn’t
identify with his plight.

Brother- You want your broth-
er to think you’re cool, whether
he be older or younger, so why
not properly impress him with
something he deﬁnitely wants no
matter how old he is. Once he
hits puberty, the one real present
your brother wants from you pe-
rennially is alcohol. So why not
appease him and get him a nice
handle of Jack Daniels? If he’s
older than you, he’ll nod silently
in gratitude, and if he’s younger,
he’ll probably build a shrine to
you in his closet.

Conversely, your brother prob-
ably won’t think you’re very cool
if you get him “Hannah Montana:
The Movie” on Blu-ray. He es-
pecially won’t think you’re cool
if you tell him about the special
new features and awesome ‘de-
leted scenes featuring Billy Ray
Cyrus’ hilarious acting while he’s
unwrapping it.

Sister- Since I personally have
no idea what my sister likes when
it comes to gifts, my choice is a
Bath and Body Works gift certiﬁ-
cate. That way, I won’t embarrass



myself by buying her the wrong
kind of scent that all the losers
in her school apparently wear.
She tends to appreciate picking
things out herself anyway, so I’m
not going to get in the way of her
shopping capabilities. Ladies, you
might have a more speciﬁc pres-
ent in mind for your sister because
you probably have taste, but re-
member that the gift certiﬁcate is
always a good bet.

It’s never fun to unwrap a pres-
ent and see a big box of condoms,
especially if you’re family is
around. I know that you’re actual-
ly trying to give your sister a nec-
essary gift that will keep her safe,
but the nice gesture makes for an
awkward Christmas present. Even
as a stocking stuffer, giving con-
doms to your sister on Christmas
is pushing it.

Boyfriend- Now that we’ve
moved on past family members,
we can get to age appropriate
gifts. Now I know that you prob-
ably want your boyfriend to spend
more time with you, but I guaran-
tee that he will love you forever if
you get him “Call of Duty: Mod-
em Warfare II” for the Playsta-
tion 3. In fact, his utter shock and
surprise that you knew what the
“Call of Duty” video game series
is might cause a proposal right
there and then. Be forewarned.

Girlfriend- Chicks dig dia-
monds. It’s not a mystery. There
really is no substitute for the joy
that will be added to both your
lives by simply going to Zales,
manning up and giving her some
bling. It’s not exactly rocket sci-
ence.

There is no better way to ruin
Christmas than giving your girl-
friend an unexpected surprise.
Now, I know that present won’t
really be opened until around Au-
gist or so, but I’m pretty sure that
your girlfriend will not appreci-
ate thegesture and will spend the
next nine months wishing that
her brother had actually bought
her that inappropriate box of con-
doms. And you never want that...

Lacrosse Bro- You may be
hanging around the lax ﬁeld and
feel the need to give your bro
friend a present that can properly

better his bro lifestyle. Well, with
the new 2010 Duke Burn Speed
3.0 cleats, your friend can a much
faster bro. He can now live out his
bromosexuality feeling light as a
feather while he runs train on the
lacrosse ﬁeld.

Dweeb— When they’re not in
the science center, dweebs love
science ﬁction movies, so your
geek friend will no doubt appreci-
ate some 3- D “Avatar” tickets for
opening night on December '16.
This movie apparently cost around
half a billion dollars to make and
it seems like it could have the big-
gest cult following since the “Lord
of the Rings” trilogy. It might be a
little too much to buy your dweeb
friend the accompanying “Ava-
tar” costume, but you never know.
It might work better than the “Re-
venge of the Nerds” box set you
got him last year.

C-School Major- You’ll prob-
ably want to buy your friend in
the C-School something long and
time consuming to get him to stop
talking about how Obama is or is
not ruining the nation as a whole.
There is no book that will get him
to shut up faster and keep him
consumed for longer than the new
sequel to “Freakonomics,” “Su-
perFreakonomics.” Steven Levitt
and Stephen Dubner’s 288 page
follow up will last your C-School
friend at least until mid- January.

Please, under no circumstances
buy your C-School friend a copy
of the proposed health care bill
that is slowly but surely making
its way through the Senate right
now. Not only will he read this
in record time, but he will assault
you with information concerning
the problems with it. Trust me,
you do not want to hear sixteen
more hours of footnoted material
about the public option. It’ll cause
your head to explode.

On that note,HI hope that these ~ 
gift ide’as'ha've prov'idéd”you with ‘ ‘

at least some insight in what to
get your loved ones this holiday
season. Enjoy ﬁnals and the much
needed vacation!

The BCS should change from a bowl system to

p a offs
It is early December, time for Christmas trees, Menorahs, and the obligatory college football p ayo

By Jonathon Salm
COLUMNIST

As the fall semester comes
to an end at colleges across the
nation, students have a number
of things to look forward to: in-
sane amounts of studying, the
ﬁnal parties before break, and of
course, the beginning of college
football bowl games. While I, like
every true red-blooded American
male, love college football, it re-
mains an indisputable fact that
there are essential problems with
the NCAA’s Bowl Championship
Series and its bowl-centric post-
season format.

Despite the excitement and
pageantry that comes with the
conclusion of college football’s
regular season, rivalry week-
end and the ensuing conference
championship games only serve
to usher in the irrational mess
that is the bowl system. While
I am not completely against the

    

A strong

idea of bowl games, the way the
BCS handles'*marquee matchups
among the nation’s best teams is
completely illogical.

Before you start screaming,
“HE WANTS A PLAYOFF!”
and quit reading, hear me out. I
am not alone in my hatred for the
BCS system. Think back to the
years since the BCS system was
established in 1998. Each year,
there have been multiple con-
troversies that leave at least one
team crying foul.

Ok, so maybe I do want a
toumament-style playoff system,
albeit a modiﬁed one that would
allow losing teams to participate
in bowl games. Take the sixteen
highest ranked teams at the end
of November to the tournament,
and begin the ﬁrst round the ﬁrst
weekend of December. Have the
tournament run for three con-

totheecilnr

Recapping sexual assault at W&L

Dear Phi readers,

We’ve heard you’re tired of
seeing our posters, tired of us
“beating the dead horse” when it
comes to rape and sexual assault
on campus, tired of shoving the
issue in your face.

Well, good.

We’ve spent 12 weeks im-
mersed in the issue that’s affect-
ing countless people on campus
and unfortunately, statistically,
will somehow touch your life as
well.

You’ve likely heard the sta-
tistic that W&L’s sexual assault
rate is twice the national average,
but have you really ever stopped
to think beyond those numbers?
They aren’t just percentages or

statistical numbers on a graph.

Those numbers represent real
people and a real problem on our
campus.

We are all victims of sexual
assault, whether we are the ones
who are physically violated or
we are the friends, sisters, broth-
ers, roommates and classmates
of someone who has been bro-
ken by this crime.

Injustice anywhere is a threat

' issue is crucial.

to freedom everywhere. Let’s
start working to make W&L a
safe place for everyone.

The Sexual Assault Preven-
tion workshop will be hosting a
community forum on sexual as-
sault on Wednesday at 7:15 p.m.
in Commons 345. We will be
presenting our recommendations
for altering W&L policy as well
as suggestions for other practices
relating to sexual assault.

We encourage you to see what
we have been working on, to ed-
ucate yourself on this important
campus issue and to make your
questions and opinions heard.
Voicing your own questions,
complaints, suggestions and
doubts about our sexual assault
This problem
is a campus-wide one, and the
entire W&L community must be
part of the solution.

We all have a stake in this.

Together we can. END IT.

Sincerely,

The Pink Team

secutive weekends, leaving two
teams to face off in the champi-
onship. Those teams would then
have two weeks to prepare for the
championship game.

This year more than ever, a
college football playoff system
makes the most sense. There are
currently ﬁve undefeated teams:
Alabama, Texas, Cincinnati,
TCU, and Boise State. While the
latter three have less of a claim
to participate in the champion-
ship game than the former two, it
nevertheless takes an impressive
team to go through a season com-
pletely undefeated. On top of the
undefeated teams, there are nu-
merous quality one and two loss
teams that could give the top ﬁve
a run for their money — Florida,
Oregon and Ohio State to name
a few. A tournament is not only
the fairest way to determine the

nation’s best team, but also one
of the most exciting ones.

Under my quixotic playoff
system, bowl games would con-
tinue. The toumament’s losers
and all other teams deemed bowl
eligible (read: have a winning re-
cord) would participate in bowls.
Ideally, the four BCS bowl games
would be reestablished as “ma-
jor” bowl games, ﬁlled with the
eight highest ranked losers from
the tournament. Three more pre-
mier bowl games would host the
rest of the toumament’s losers.

Despite the obvious ingenuity
of a playoff system, BCS support-
ers nonetheless ﬁnd reasons to
criticize a playoff. One, it would
make the eventual national cham-
pions play an extra four games.
However, consider taking away
conference championship games
as well as one in-conference

game and one out-of-conference
game during the regular season.
That leaves only one extra game,
possibly two if the champion’s
conference does play a confer-
ence championship game. '

The other popular criticism of
a playoff system is not as easy to
debunk. The main problem with
the playoff system is that right
now changing the bowl structure
is currently unfeasible. Why?
The complex structure involved
with bowl sponsors, conference
tie-ins, and television coverage
makes the bowl system a lucra-
tive and proﬁtable institution.
Unfortunately, it means that we
are unlikely to see a playoff sys-
tem anytime soon.

We’re certainly getting closer.
Just this year, the Mountain West
Conference collectively proposed
an eight-team playoff, which was

debate

then quickly rejected by the BCS
presidential oversight committee.
Even politicians are getting into
it. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah)
has announced that he will likely
be suing the BCS as an anti-com-
petitive trust under the Sherman
Anti—Trust Act. The Senate is
slated to begin anti-trust hearings
on the BCS in the spring. While
I am not a fan of mixing politics
and sports (shouldn’t politicians
be ﬁxing healthcare, social se-
curity, etc?), I admire Senator
Hatch’s dedication. However, in
all likelihood, little change will
come from the government.

As for now, it seems that all
we can do is sit back and watch
what happens. And for the next
month, that means watching un-
healthy amounts of college foot-
ball. I’m alright with that.

Sexual assault problems at home

An anonymous writer tells her story of being raped by a former boyfriend

Sometimes people can con-
vince themselves that they
weren’t raped until they share
their story with others. That’s
how it was with me. I convinced
myself that being treated the
way I was treated was normal.
It’s not.

I didn’t get my ﬁrst boyfriend
until the summer before my se-
nior year of high school. I had
always felt like there must be
something wrong with me, that
no boys would take notice of me.
But he convinced me that there
wasn’t anything wrong with me,
at least for a while. He was a year
younger than me, and our rela-
tionship went steadily downhill
all that year. I was crazy about
him, though, and didn’t think
I would ever ﬁnd anything bet-
ter. He_even told me that no one
else besides him would ever care
about me the couple times I tried
to stand up for myself.

He broke up with me before
I left for college, but he contin-
ued to drain me emotionally,
always calling on me when he
“needed me” and always giv-
ing me conﬂicting answers as
to whether or not he still loved
me. I was confused and strained
by this relationship and by the
way he treated me, but every
time I came home he acted like

we were still together when we
were alone and convinced me to
engage in sexual activities with
him. I complied because I’m the
type of person who would nev-
er do something like that with
someone I didn’t care about, and
the fact that he was willing to do
it with me made me think he still
cared.

When I came back to school
after Christmas, I realized I
couldn’t handle it anymore. I was
sick of being lied to and ignored
and expected to drop everything
when he wanted me to, and I be-
came really close friends with a
guy who made me realize that
maybe it was possible for some-
one else to care about me. He
treated me like I was special and
made me feel safe, and I started
to build up my conﬁdence and

_ realize I was better than the boy

back home.

When I went home for Feb-
ruary Break, I tried to maintain
my friendship with my ex be-
cause I have a hard time letting
go of people, and I didn’t want
to feel like I had wasted the last
two years of my life by being de-
voted to someone that I was en-
tirely cutting out. I politely told
him that I didn’t want to keep
things going the way that they
had been, and that I had feelings

for my friend at school who had
taught me that I didn’t deserve to
be treated the way my ex treated
me. My ex said that he respected
that. He lied.

We were alone together on
his birthday, and I had been
texting my ‘crush,’ I guess you
could call him. My ex didn’t take
very well to this, and he grabbed
me and started trying to kiss me.
I told him that I didn’t want that,
and he told me I didn’t really
have a choice. He said I couldn’t
ﬁght it and that I couldn’t change
what was meant to be, and that
my crush didn’t really care about
me because no one but him ever
would. He told me Iwasn’t worth
people caring about and that I
was lucky he still did after how
ungrateful I had been by spend-

‘ ing so much time getting close to

my crush.

I tried again to get him to
stop, but at this point he was tak-
ing my clothes off. I realized that
no wasn’t an answer, and when I
tried to push him off he threw me
against the ﬂoor so hard that my
body started to ache. I made my-
self stop feeling because I didn’t
want him to see me cry.

For a long time after that I
told myself that it couldn’t possi-
bly have been rape, just because
the act was something that I had

participated in with him before.
But that doesn’t change the fact
that I said no, or the fact that he
had told me he would respect that
I didn’t want that. That doesn’t
change the fact that I regret it
and that I want to cry every time
I think about it. It doesn’t change
the fact that I feel sick inside
now just like I did then when my
head smashed into the wall when
he threw me down. That should
have never happened to me, and
I hope it never happens to anyone
else. Never let someone convince
you that you have to do what he
or she says because no one else
will ever care about you. It’s not
true. I know it’s hard to feel that
way, when your ﬁrst relationship
is all that you have to base your
experience off, but if it doesn’t
feel right, it’s not, and don’t let
anyone tell you you’ll never be
able to do better.

Shakespearewith a W&L twist

W&L Shakespeare Society sﬁrst performance is a modern interpretation of “Love :9 Labour 3* Lost”

By Allison Chopin
MANAGING EDITOR

Frats and srats, Hawaiian
grass skirts and pot-smoking
Elizabethans?

That doesn’t sound like your
typical production of Shake-
speare.

The Washington and Lee
Shakespeare Society gave Shake-
speare a W&L twist with its ﬁrst
production on Saturday in the
Johnson Theater. The brand
new, entirely student-run the-
ater troupe performed William

Shakespeare’s comedy, “Love’s
Labour’s Lost.”

In this play, the king of Na-
varre and his three companions
promise themselves to three
years of study and take an oath
to avoid the company of women.
But a princess and her three la-
dies are on their way to the court,
and in comedic fashion, the king
and his nobles fall in love and
conspire to woo these women.

Junior Jean Chapman, direc-

tor, said in a talk-back following
the performance that the script
reminded her of W&L’s Greek
system, since a group of girls in-
trude on the house of men who
have sworn off relationships, and
hilarious courting rituals ensue.
The Shakespeare Society’s
modern interpretation of the play
brings these elements to life, in-
corporating modern dress and
props and subtly portraying the
king’s court and the princess and

her ladies as stereotypical frater-
nity and sorority members.

In one scene, for example,
the princess and her ladies and
envoy, played by Emma Patrick,
Danielle Maurer, Adriana Gon-
zalez, Sharon Chu and Ellen Val-
entine, get drunk from bottles of
Smirnoff and a Solo cup before
meeting with the men. In anoth-
er, the king (Levi Throckrnorton)
and his men (Gobind Moore,
Tony.Kelly and Paul Nguyen)

attend a party dressed in tropical
grass skirts and leis, mimicking
the tropical themed parties held
by W&L fraternities.

The cast featured a mix of tal-
ent and experience. The intent
behind the Shakespeare Society,
according to Chapman, is to al-
low students who are interested
in Shakespeare and acting, but
may not have the time to act in
a performance by the theater
department, to get involved in a

production.

Chapman also gave credit to
many of the actors for contribut-
ing their own ideas and adding
bits of new humor to the play.
Considering that the cast only
rehearsed for about four weeks,
she said she was pleased with the
production.

Better option for buying books

F irst—year plans

By Tory Dickerson
s TA F F w R IT E R

As fall semester is wrapping
up, winter semester is not far
away. The start of a new semester
means new classes and hundreds
of dollars worth of new books.

Though Washington and Lee
students have the option of sell-
ing back old textbooks at the end
of each semester, the options the
school offers for buying new text
books is fairly limited.

to start textbook

First-year Amy Heard is try-
ing to change that.

Heard’s plan is to start a book
exchange option for W&L stu-
dents; this way, students have
another option as opposed to
spending tons of money at the
bookstore.

She hopes to have people
turn in their books from previous
semesters, and the quality and

number of books they turn in will
determine how many they are al-
lowed to take out.

“It takes a lot of coordina-
tion,“ Heard says.

' Heard hopes to gather a team
of people who would help with
the management process. When
students turn in books, the rough
value of the books will be con-
sidered before students will be

  ms were SON
     PER NIGHT‘-  

allowed to take books out.

For example, if a student
turned in four books he will no
longer use, he is entitled to take
four new books that they would
need for upcoming classes that
someone else had turned in.

In the event that the exchange
program didn’t have a book a
student needs, Heard hopes to
create some sort of credit sys-

tem, so that for the next round of
exchanges that student would be
ensured a book he needed.

Heard has pitched her idea to
the Executive Committee (EC)
and she says they seemed enthu-
siastic about her idea. She would
need to form the exchange as if
it was a club and get it approved
by the EC in order to get the ex-
change up and running.

exchange program so students can save money on books

“The biggest [issue] will be
getting people to actually do it,”
Heard says.

Anyone who has more ques-
tions or wishes to be part of the
management team can contact
Amy Heard at hearda13@mail.

THE RING-TUM PHI 0 5

How Warner and Gary changed the league

Columnist Adam Cancryn looks at the evolution of NFL offenses and the eﬂect on fantasy football

By Adam cancryn
COLUMNIST

1999.

Y2K threatened to paralyze the world.
Ricky Martin was your favorite singer’s
favorite singer. The dotcom frenzy was
the new gold rush. And whether we real-
ized it or not, a revolution was occurring
within the NFL.

Kurt Warner and Olandis Gary are, at
ﬁrst glance, strange bedfellows. Warner
quarterbacked the St. Louis Rams to a
world championship, the ringleader of
the “Greatest Show on Turf.” Ten years
later, he remains a force in the league.

Gary emerged from training camp in
’99 as the Denver Broncos’ top back. He
rushed for 1,159 yards despite playing
for a 6-10 team. Within four seasons,
Gary was out of the league.

Despite their diverging trajectories,
the two combined to leave a lasting
mark on the NFL. Warner showed that
a Super Bowl could be won through the
air, dispelling the belief that a team was
only as good as its running game. And
Gary demonstrated that it didn’t take ex-
ceptional talent to rush for 1,000 yards,
just a skilled offensive line.

Ten years later, we’re seeing the
effects of that ‘99 season. Teams are
throwing more and succeeding. And
while the running back position is still
important, no player is more valuable
now than the quarterback. The NFL has
become a pass—ﬁrst league and, by asso-
ciation, so has fantasy football.

One.

The round in which all knowledge-
able fantasy football owners draft a run-

ning back.

It’s the golden rule for the 18 million
Americans that play the country’s most
popular online game. To win, you draft
a running back ﬁrst.

The reasoning behind such a strategy
is simple. Elite running backs receive
the most touches on the team. The more
touches a player gets, the more chances
he has to gain yards and score touch-
downs. More yards and touchdowns
means more total points, and more
points means more wins for the respec-
tive fantasy team.

But that was before. Like the one-bar
helmet and the Pro Bowl in Hawaii, the
golden rule is on its way out.

Five.

The number of quarterbacks with a
passer rating exceeding 100 through 12
weeks. In a league featuring increasing-
ly complex defensive schemes, it’s as-
tounding that so many quarterbacks are
doing so well. The passer-rating statistic
is not the only way to measure the po-
sition, but a rating over 100 equals ex-
cellent play on the ﬁeld no matter how
you cut it. And this year is setting a new
precedent.

Over the past 10 years, there have
never been more than four 100+ rated
passers. In that same time, only 2004
featured more than nine 90+ rated QBS,
with 11. This year there are 12.

So what’s to explain the sudden im-
provement?

In short, it all goes back to Kurt War-
ner. Once the Rams rode their QB ’s arm

to a championship, other teams began to
shed their run-ﬁrst philosophies. Since
then, the percentage of plays run from
the Shotgun Formation has steadily in-
creased. Teams replaced running plays
with shorter, smarter passes.

And most importantly, the college
game has trickled into the pro ranks.
While the Wildcat offense grabbed head-
lines, the Spread offense is making the
real impact. NFL teams have poached
elements from schools like Florida and
Texas Tech and incorporated them into a
pass-happy game plan.

Teams like the ‘07 New England Pa-
triots only served to reinforce this new
philosophy. And 2009 is set to complete
the revolution. The top four passing
teams in the NFL are a combined 30-14
through 12 weeks.

154/792/9

147/648/8

The number of carries, yards and
touchdowns accumulated by Miami
Dolphins running backs Ricky Williams
and Ronnie Brown, respectively.

Before Brown’s injury sidelined
him for the year, the two were on pace
to become the ﬁrst 1,000 yard rushing
duo since 1985. It would have been a
rare feat, one for which the tandem have
Olandis Gary to thank. Like Warner,
Gary transformed his position. A no-
name running back plugged into Mike
Shanahan’s offense, he demonstrated
that success on the ground isn’t depen-
dent on the quality of the runner, but of
the offensive line. While the carousel

continued in the backﬁeld, the Broncos’
line remained the same.

Since then, the concept of a hier-
archy at running back, with a defined
starter and back up, has been under
siege. First there emerged the special-
ized role of pass catching, 3rd down

back. That spawned the goal line back.

Now, coaches are using up to four backs
interchangeably. In 2003, 13 running
backs averaged more than 20 carries per
game. Only Steven Jackson and Adrian
Peterson make that cut this year.

It is an approach that makes sense.
There is no reason to wear down one
running back when the same total pro-
duction can be had from three. But
while it has worked out well for NFL
teams, there is no worse feeling for fan-
tasy owners than deciding between two
players on game day, and then watching
your benched back score three touch-
downs. Which brings us to the last two
numbers:

Eight and Four.

The number of respective quarter-
backs and running backs among the top
12 fantasy football point scorers.

The key to winning in the NFL and in
your fantasy football league is the same:
ﬁnd players that provide the most value.
Traditionally, this has meant grabbing
a top running back. But survey today’s
NFL landscape, and that thinking looks
mighty outdated.

Quarterbacks are the new sure thing.
ESPN’s preseason rankings listed Drew
Brees, Tom Brady, Peyton Manning,

Warner and Aaron Rodgers as the top
ﬁve QBs. In twelve weeks, those rank-
ings have barely changed, with Rodg-
ers at one, Brees three, Manning four,
Brady six and Warner 13 in total fantasy
points scored.

Compare that to the preseason top
running backs: Peterson, Michael Tum-
er, Maurice Jones-Drew, Matt Forteand
Jackson. Of those, only Jones-Drew and
Peterson are currently in the top 20. And
this year isn’t an anomaly: just ask 2008
LaDainian Tomlinson owners or 2007
Larry Johnson owners.

All of this is not to say that running
backs are no longer valuable to fan-
tasy owners. Chris Johnson is a savior
for thousands of teams and Peterson is
steady as ever. But there is simply no
guarantee either will reprise their star-
ring role year after year.

Meanwhile, top quarterbacks con-
sistently excel no matter their situation.
Rodgers has been sacked a league lead-
ing 44 times. Manning’s number two
option is Pierre Garcon. Brady is com-
ing off a crippling knee injury. Yet fanta-
sy owners of a top-ﬁve quarterback are
likely cruising into the playoffs.

Remember that as the NFL evolves,
so does fantasy football. Pro teams
aren’t crippled by the absence of a top-
ﬂight back and your team shouldn’t be
either.

Lady Generals look to improve after tough early losses

W&L is 1-3, after defeating Hollins University in between losses to Mary Washington, Christoper Newport, and Guilford

By Stephen Peck
surr wnmza

The Washington and Lee University
Women’s basketball team has stumbled
out of the gate, beating Hollins Uni-
versity but dropping matches to Mary
Washington, Christopher Newport and
Guilford College. The team’s out-of-

ton back on November 17th. Typically a
very solid program, the Eagles had some
troubles with W&L, with Mary Wash-
ington leading only 30-29 at half.
Unfortunately, the Generals could not
keep up with the depth of Mary Wash-

“The 1-3 record is a little deceptive. We were very

competitve and we ’re still very excited about our poten-

tial. ”

Meg Ingram, guard

conference games were both against top
25 opponents so the women knew the
start of the season would be a big test.

“The 1-3 record is a little deceptive,”
said sophomore guard Meg Ingram
added. “We were very competitive and
we’re still very excited about our poten-
tial.”

The Generals opened up the year with
a home contest against Mary Washing-

Generals basketball looks to first-years

ington. Ten different players scored for
the Eagles. The Generals’ attack was led
by the big three of sophomore forward
Becca Bolton (16 points), Ingram (16
points) and junior forward Felice Her-
man (six points and nine rebounds).

As expected in the ﬁrst game of the
year, W&L struggled to ﬁnd a consistent
shot. Ingram only connected on three
of 11 three-point attempts and the team

shot 38 percent overall.

But the Generals could not dwell on
the past long as they had to board the
buses just three days later to face off
against Christopher Newport. Against
Christopher Newport, the Generals’ sec-
ond-half struggles continued; they led at
the half 34-32, but a 14-2 second-half
run by the Captains put the game out of
reach with a ﬁnal score of 71-57. Bolton
notched 20 points and seven rebounds,
Ingram netted 16 to go with four steals
and Herman scored seven and grabbed
six boards.

W&L then traveled to Hollins Uni-
versity to open ODAC play on the 30th.
“We’re going to have to go out and
compete every night to do well in the
ODAC,” said Ingram. “It’s a tough con-
ference, but we have great team chemis-
try and strong leadership from our cap-
tains: Allie long and Kaitlyn Kamp.”

After struggling against Mary Wash-
ington and Christopher Newport, the
Generals put on a basketball clinic
versus Hollins, winning by a score of
95 -60. The absurdly high scoring to-
tal was made possible by a plethora of
strong performances and a 32-8 run to

start the game that completely demoral-
ized Hollins. Bolton (22 points on 8-10
shooting), Ingram (18 in just 23 minutes
of play) and ﬁrst-years Rachel Warrick
(18 and nine boards) and Katy Wilson
(12 and seven boards) led the offensive
onslaught.

W&L was lights-out from the ﬁeld
as they shot 48 percent. They also out-
rebounded Hollins 49-31 and tallied 25
assists to just 18 turnovers. Head Coach
Mandy King had to have been pleased
with the effort she got from her team.

With a win now under their belt, the
Generals traveled to face Guilford Col-
lege in hopes of creating a modest win
streak. This was not to be, however,
as Guilford dropped W&L in dramatic
fashion, winning 55-52.

The late-game heroics involved a
clutch three pointer with 1:36 left by
Warrick and two game-tying free throws
by Bolton with just seconds left, but
Guilford knocked down a desperation
three-pointer with just six seconds left
to put the ﬁnal dagger in the Generals.

A heartbreaking game was made
harder to handle as W&L shot a mere

Leadership:
Rachel Phillips

What energizes you about tak-
ing on leadership responsibili-
ties? I enjoy working with others
ind sharing my ideas with the
;chool. As a leader, I have the op-
)ortunity to motivate others, and

came away with the win.

While the team has had its struggles,
challenges are to be expected when you
combine ranked opponents, early season
shooting troubles and a relatively young
team.

“I think one of our greatest strengths
is that our team is really balanced this
year,” Bolton said. “Everyone can score
and make great plays, and we all share
the ball really well. It’s just a matter of
playing more as a team.”

The Generals will return to action
on Dec. 28 in the Surf & Slam San Di-
ego Hoop Classic. W&L will open with
Simpson. The Generals have every in-
tention of making a statement at the
tournament.

“We deﬁnitely want to win the tour-
nament over Christmas break,” Bolton
said. “We start playing the good ODAC
teams as soon as we get back, so we want
to improve a lot at the tournament.”

The Washington and Lee men’s basketball
team has built up a winning tradition over the
last two seasons and is working to continue
that tradition. ‘

Prior to the 2007-2008 season, the Gen-
erals experienced years and years of losing
records and heartbreaking seasons. Coach
Hutchinson’s recruiting after the 2006-2007
season brought in a crop of young, talented
players with a desire to turn the program
around. But with such a young team, the older
players such as Chris McHugh, Isaiah Good-
man and Ben Heller knew they had to lead
the youthful squad and unify the inexperi-

enced players in order to win. The experience ‘

and guidance shown by those leaders led to
a 15-win season, the ﬁrst winning season for
the Generals in over 10 years. Those players
have since graduated and the Generals have
circled back to another young, inexperienced
team.

This year’s team is composed of three se-
niors, one junior, three sophomores and 10
ﬁrst-years, a young team to say the least.

But the inexperience on the team is excit-
ing for the older players. As the upperclass-

men train and guide these young players, they
have the opportunity to mold their style of
play into the style of a true Generals’ basket-
ball player. The upperclassmen leaders have
had to assume the roles of the players who
taught them when they were young and in-
experienced.

During the olfseason the team did weight
training, team led scrimmages and extra
shooting sessions to prepare for the tough
season ahead and to bond with the new play-
ers.

“We communicated with the younger play-
ers through email, just letting them know the
expectations of the program and how we had
a lot of work to do for the upcoming season,”
said junior point guard Jason Cimino.

Now that the season is underway, it is
clear that the hard work involved in getting
the young players prepared is starting to pay
off.

First-year players such as J.D. Ey, Hans
Harris and Taylor Gilﬁllan have been strong
contributors to the Generals’ success so far
this season. Watching the team, one can see
that there are still many kinks to work out be-

fore the team can reach its maximum poten-
tial, but this can be expected with any young
team. Each game brings the players closer as
they learn to play with one another in a more
fluid and productive manner.

“Players who have graduated have passed
on a sense of unity that will always be in the
Washington and Lee men’s basketball pro-
gram,” said senior captain Zac White. “The
further the season goes, the closer the team
gets, as always. This is because of how hard
we work together. Everyone understands that
each member of the team has a role and is
dependent on each other to fulﬁll that role.
That is what our team is built on.”

The talent level is already higher than
ever before and the unity needed for another
successful season is developing rapidly. The
leadership and effort of the older players is
showing on the court. The lessons learned
from past players have been cast onto the
gifted ﬁrst-year athletes. The tools are in
place and the team seems eager and ready to
embark on its third straight winning season.

:ogether we can make a positive
:hange on campus.

What has been one of your
most rewarding aspects of
leadership at W&L?

As a volleyball team captain, it

ias helped me become a stronger
eader and represent our school well.
What legacy of leadership do you hope to leave for oth-
ers who follow you here? Anyone can be a leader in their own

T he Generals regained momentum with Close weekend win over Averett; now 5 -2

Following a narrow loss to Bridgewa-
ter earlier in the week, the Washington and
Lee men’s basketball team found a way
to win another tight contest as it outlasted
Averett 61-58 and improved its record to
5-2 overall.

Senior forward Andrew Payne
cheers on his teammates from
the sidelines in the Generals’
68-64 loss to Bridgewater on
Wednesday.

Despite a furious second-half come-
back attempt, the Generals fell short
against the Bridgewater Eagles 68-64 on
Wednesday.

With just under 10 minutes remaining
in the game, the Blue and White trailed
55-32. But the team was undeterred by
the scoring gap and went on a 30-6 run
over the course of the next eight minutes
to gain a 62-61 advantage. Unfortunately,
the lead was short-lived as the Eagles
leading-scorer, Dominic Trawick. hit a
fade away jumper off of his own offensive
rebound and Bridgewater went on to win
the game.

Although the Generals came up short
in the end, it shows a lot about this team’s
perseverance, said junior guard Jason
Cimino.

“The Bridgewater comeback was fu-
eled by a lot of heart and determination,"
Cimino said. “We dug ourselves a huge
hole and knew the only way to come back
was to scratch and claw and ﬁght our way
back into the game. This team has a lot
of heart; it’s just a matter of using it the
whole game, not after we get down by 20
points."

The last time the two teams met was in
the conference tournament last year when
the Generals knocked off Bridgewater in
the semiﬁnals. Seeking revenge against

W&L for ending their season, the Eagles
came out fast on both offense and defense.
In the ﬁrst half, Bridgewater shot 60.9
percent from the ﬁeld, while holding the
Blue and White to just 23.8 percent. in all,
Bridgewater built a 34-19 halftime lead.

Even though Cimino opened the sec-
ond stanza with a three-pointer, the Eagles
continued their offensive prowess and in-
creased their lead. After the Generals were
down by 23, the team changed its defen-
sive philosophy and this decision helped
to propel the squad. said senior captain
Ben Goetsch.

“In the middle ofthe second half, we re-
ally started to put the pressure on [Bridge-
water] with traps and an aggressive press,"

said Goetsch. “We were fortunate to get a .

few tumovers out of that and capitalized
at the other end. It was encouraging to see
that we did not fold when we were far be-
hind, even though we would rather have
not put ourselves in that position.”

With the added defensive pressure,
W&L forced 20 second—half turnovers
and 32 total for the game. Cimino led the
team with a career-high six steals and that
translated into points on the offensive end.
Goetsch added 17 in the second halfto ﬁn-
ish with a game-high 27.

And with 1:08 remaining in the game,
it was Goetsch who nailed a three-pointer
from the top of the arc to give the Gener-
als the brief one point lead. However, the
Eagles went on to score seven more points
in the contest to close out the game.

In the encounter, ﬁrst-year guard Doug

Poetzsch tallied 11 points, including some
clutch three-balls in the come-back ef-
fort. Senior forward Zac White added nine
points and sevenrebounds.

On Saturday, the Generals travelled to

play Averett University. Once again, W&L

came out of the gates slowly and fell down
by double ﬁgures. However, unlike the
Bridgewater game, the Blue and White
battled back immediately. Toward the end
of the ﬁrst half, Poetzsch continued his
hot shooting from the previous game and
scored seven points to narrow the gap to
25-27. With 28 seconds remaining in the
opening frame, Goetsch stole the ball on

the defensive end and drove the length of
the court to convert a layup while being
fouled; this knotted the score at 27-27 at
the half.

The Generals carried its momentum
into the second half and built a 41-32 lead.
The nine point margin was punctuated with
a dunk by ﬁrst-year forward J .D. Ey off of
a backdoor pass from sophomore guard
Kyle Bond. The Cougars then chipped
away at the lead and deadlocked the score
at 48-48 with 5:35 left in the game.

Momentum had swung back in Av-
eret_t’s favor as they scored the next ﬁve
points in the game. Senior forward An-
drew Payne ignited the Generals after
coming off the bench and scoring seven of
11 of the team’s points (and 13 total for the
game) to re-gain a 59-58 lead with 37.5
seconds to go.

In the end, it was W&L’s defense which
forced an Averett shot clock violation on
the next possession to seal the contest. The

‘Generals put an exclamation point on the

game with a Poetzsch layup in the ﬁnal
seconds, making the ﬁnal score 61-58.

This year, the Washington and Lee
men’s basketball team hopes that it can
take the next step and win a conference
title after narrowly falling short one sea-
son ago.

“My goal this season is the same as
every other season since I have been here
- to win the ODAC,” said Goetsch. “The
league is especially strong this year, but
we have been competitive with or beaten
every team in the league over the past

year. I believe that we can push ourselves
to the top of the standings, especially as
this year’s ﬁrst-year class continues to
learn and improve."
