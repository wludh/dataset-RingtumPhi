Enacting
social change

New program calls on V
community members to speak
up during risky situations

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

Green Dot, a power-based personal violence
prevention program that capitalizes on the power of
peer and cultural inﬂuence, is coming to the Wash-
ington and Lee campus.

Green Dot is based on the social change theory,
which targets all members of a community to be
potential bystanders. The strategy targets power in-
equality such as sexual assault, rape, stalking and
other kinds of violence that exploit an imbalanced
power dynamic. Green Dot works to go against this
model by engaging community members through
“awareness, education and skills practice of proac-
tive behaviors that establish intolerance of violence
as the norm,” said Licensed Clinical‘PsychoIogist
Jennifer Sayre of University Counseling Services.

Sayre is working with student organizations
such as I in 4, Speak, KEWL, LIFE and the END
IT campaign in implementing Green Dot at W&L.

The idea behind Green Dot, according to the
University of Kentucky violence prevention web-
site, is to visualize a map, in which power-based
personal violence is represented by red dots, which
continue to spread and ﬁll the map. The objective of
Green Dot is to outshine and displace these red dots
with green dots, which can be anything from pull-
ing a friend out ofa high-risk situation to posting a
supportive F acebook message. I

The Green Dot initiative was developed at the
University of Kentucky by Dr. Dorothy Edwards,
who gave an overview of Green Dot at W&L on
May 3.

“If most of us choose inaction—if most of us
choose to close our eyes to this issueeif most of
us choose apathy and indifferencevthen the red
dots stand! If we do not begin replacing moments
of violence and inaction with moments of support
and safety, then we will su_rely continue to have o_ur
friends, partners, students, colleagues and class-
mates become victims,” said Sayre. who worked
with a team in bringing Green Dot to W&L because
of its potential effectiveness on campus.

The Green Dot strategy asks students to consider
personal safety as a community issue. Speciﬁcally,
the approach encourages students to "think about
their personal role and involvement in making the
campus a safer place.

According to outgoing END IT president Emily
Coyle, W&L has a disproportionately high rate of
sexual assault, compared to the national statistic for
college campuses.

While there are already numerous organizations
on campus that seek to address, prevent and elimi-
nate sexual assault, Green Dot implements a differ-
ent strategy. It is not an organization, but an initia-
tive that involves all community members.

Coyle differentiated that SPEAK and 1 in 4 are
about education and awareness, while END IT is
about working for change in how we address sexual
assault and its prevention on this campus.

“We need Green Dot because it isn’t just another
group. The groups on campus have their purpose,
certainly, but Green Dot is an initiative for every-
one,” said Coyle.

Incoming END IT president Eric Gehman agreed
with Coyle.

“It’s a campaign and training program funded
and organized by the university that will be used in
all sorts of contexts, for any and all groups on cam-
pus who want to make the university a safer place to
be,” Gehman said. “That means fraternities, sorori-
ties, athletic teams, service groups and other student
organizations who want to help end sexual assault
and violence at W&L can be Green Dot-trained and
can help play a role in solving this problem.”

Though Green Dot teaches people to recognize
“red dots,” dangerous situations, or dangerous situ-
ations in which bystanders could act but do not act,
and to teach people to act on those “red dots” with
“green dots” of action - by choosing to intervene or
getting someone to intervene, Coyle believes that
the initiative is not about changing how community
members socialize at W&L.

“It’s about engendering a culture of support in
which we as individuals choose to intervene if we
see a bad situation about to occur because support-
ing one another is the right thing to do,” she said.

About 30 Washington and Lee stu-
dents were injured at an off-campus
party Friday night after the deck they
were standing on collapsed. "

Twenty-two students were treated '

at Carilion Stonewall Jackson Hos-
pital, and all but one were released
by Saturday morning, said Dawn

Watkins, the dean of students, in a -

campus--wide e-mail.

The remaining student underwent
surgery for a compound ankle fracture
Saturday afternoon.

Others were treated at the student
health center.

The accident happened at a house
at the corner ofFurrs Mill and Green-
house roads, known to students as
“County Seat." About 50 people were
standing on the house’s back porch
at I l :30 p.m., when the structure
collapsed beneath them, said Rock-

. bridge County Police Sergeant Hugh

Ferguson.

“We had everybody otmin a timely
manner and on the way to the hospi-
tal,” he said.

The residents of County Seat said
in a statement they felt “grateful for
the fast and effective response ofthe
Rockbridge County police, ﬁre and
medical teams.”

Students had gathered at County
Seat for a beach-themed party—a
kick-off to the Phi Kappa Sigma
fraternity‘s annual “Bahamas” party
during the day on Saturday. Ferguson
said that he did not think the collapsed
porch was the fault of the boys who
live in County Seat.

“A few people live in the house,
but you get a crowd of hundreds, and
accidents happen,” he said. “It’s not
surprising.”

Many students, ofﬁcials and ad-

i “l‘ltI”~Ii”rS.1l:I§4li7[’Zf€l7i’:Ia’G-iiI"e‘€‘

ministrators have now entered an
ongoing debate over whether or not
there iss anyone to blame for the
accident.

County Seat is one of many off-

administrators.

“I don’t think we have been silent
about the choices students make
on and off-campus,” Watkins said.
“From a university perspective, we

W &L just sort turns its back on all ofthis, and

these kids do whatever they want. ”

PHILIP WELCHI Rockbridge County resident .

campus rental houses where students
go to party. Some'nearby residents
feel that W&L administrators should
do a betterjob of monitoring student
behavior at off-campus parties.

Philip Welch, a furniture artist who
lives near County Seat with his wife
and young son, has been a Rockbridge
County Resident for four years. He
said he hopes the school will learn
from Friday night’s accident.

“Down here, it’s sort of like it’s
no-man’s land,” said Welch, who
walked down to County Seat when
he heard sirens late Friday night.
“W&Ljust sort of turns its back on
all of this, and these kids do whatever
they want.”

But Watkins disagrees. She said
that she and other university ofﬁcials
address off-campus housing issues
in a variety of ways—from sending
letters home to parents that offer ad-
vice on how to choose an off-campus
house to working with the Campus
Community Coalition in an attempt to
foster better communication between
students, local residents and W&L

.1" t».-’.

On Friday night, the porch at the off-campus ho

try to hit it [off-campus housing] at
every angle."

In a statement, County Seat resi-
dent and W&L junior Jeff Roberts
stressed the responsibility that stu-
dents who host off-campus parties
take upon themselves.

“The collapse of County Seat’s
porch reasserted the importance of
safety planning when hosting an off-
campus social event,” Roberts wrote
in an e-mail. “In a social environment
where gatherings can quickly turn into
overcrowded parties, it is important
for hosts to be pro-actvely cognizant
of potential safety issues.”

Many students place blame on
Mitchell Shaner, the landlord for
County Seat and several other student
houses.

“I deﬁnitely think the landlord has
some responsibility for the accident,”
said Farrell Ulrich, a W&L senior
who was standing in the County Seat
kitchen, which opens onto the p'orch,
when the structure collapsed. Shaner
said he responded to the scene ofthe
accident Friday night as soon as he

  

,,..:

lapsed under thetcomblned weight of 50 peopl

  
   

_...._

heard about it.

“My family and I are sincerely
thankful that no one was seriously
hurt,” Shaner said. “Safety has always
been and still is of utmost importance
to us.”

Watkins said that students and
parents can better inform themselves
about the properties available to rent
in and around Lexington by consult-
ing the Virginia Landlord-Tenant
Handbook on the W&L website’s
“Residential Life” page.

Another student was hurt outside
of County Seat this past fall. Liz
Blackwood, a sophomore from Mary-
land, was struck by a Traveller bus in
October. Blackwood was hospitalized
with a fractured left hip. Witnesses of
the event said Blackwood fell beneath
one of Traveller’s rear tires when the
crowd waiting for the safe ride bus
surged forward in an attempt to stop
it and get a ride.

Since Traveller’s inception, the
number of student DUI arrests has
declined signiﬁcantly, Watkins said.’

In the 1990s, about 25 students
were arrested each year for driving
under the influence of alcohol. This
year, only three students received
DUls, according to Watkins.

In an e-mail about the collapsed
porch and resulting student injuries,
Watkins said university ofﬁcials are
cooperating with local police in their
investigation ofthe accident.

  

e.

Twenty-two students were treated at Carilion Stonewall Jackson Hospital. The students who live at the off-campus house
urge party hosts to keep safety in mind at social events.

Travelling abroad

Stockton Bullitt makes sweeping generalizations about how to survive outside the United States this summer

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

The much-too-short spring
term is drawing to a close, and
now we must face the depressing
reality of lives at home. Leaving
Lexington means the beginning
of home-cooked meals, tanning
by the beach and quality barbe-
cue. I simply don’t know how
we’ll survive.

However, there are a good
amount of students who are do—
ing something unique with their
summers. Instead of getting jobs
in America, they choose to travel
internationally.

We have students visiting
every part of the world, from
Shanghai to Barcelona to Ven-
ezuela.

If you are travelling abroad
at some point this summer,
there are a few things you need
to know before you actually go
there. I know, each country has
its own distinbt culture, and mak-
ing broad generalizations about
people is never a good idea to do,
but if KEWL can do it, so can I.

Being a fantastic narcissist,
I have no problem with saying
that I am an apt world traveler,
and therefore I have no problem
telling you that this article alone

  
 

will solve most problems you
encounter outside U.S. borders.
That’s the nice thing about be-
ing American: we’re so high up
on the world power rankings
that we don’t need to deal with
the details when it comes to any
country who isn’t us. So, wheth-
er you’re staying in Mexico or
Bangladesh, using most of these
guidelines shouldn’t get you into
any trouble.

The ﬁrst and most important
thing to remember when travel-
ling abroad is that you will drink
and smoke more than you do here
in Lexington. I don’t care if you
spend your Tuesday nights get-
ting asked to leave at Macado’s
or attending RUF, there are two
altruisms outside the U.S.: you
will drink regardless of who you
are and any 10 year-old can out-
drink you easily. Smoking ciga-
rettes is optional and depends
more on the country you’re
visiting, but again if you think
you’re on a path to emphysema,
you haven’t left the country. As
you’ve no doubt thought about
while riding in the backseat of a
LexPo vehicle, alcohol standards
outside the U.S. are relaxed, but

what that really means is that
anyone and everyone can throw
down shots without blinking.
Well, that is unless you’re vaca-
tioning in Saudi Arabia, probably
the only country that we could
actually beat in the “Beerlym-
pics.” Oh yeah, prepare for some
bitter morning hangovers, too,
especially when it comes time to
write an opinion article.

You’re also going to have to
know how to smile and nod or
frown and shake your head. I
don’t care ifyou’re visiting Aus-
tralia, you won’t understand half
the things anyone tells you. So in
casual conversation with a local,
learn how to clear your face of
any emotion whatsoever while
the other person is talking. Give
him or her the same blank stare
lecture halls give professors
when they ask a question about
the reading nobody did. Once
the local finishes his or her com-
ment, you respond by making
eye contact, smiling and nodding
either nonchalanlly or emphati-
cally depending on how excited
the local seems.

Only in cases when the local
ends his sentence with a par-

Fraternity promise to revamp new member program

To the Washington and Lee
Community:

During new member educa-

Pi Kappa Phi engaged in behav-

We failed to live up the high
standard of personal conduct that

and for that we apologize. In
working with the University, the
Interfratemity Council, and our

national headquarters, we have
devised a plan to reinstill in our
organization the values on which
this University was founded.

In the next year, we will be-
come more active in promoting
and supporting campus initia-
tives aimed at improving gender
relations, substance abuse aware-
ness and bystander behavior.

Also, we will recommit our-
selves to the local community by

of community service during

isn’t that hard

ticularly low inﬁection do you
change your blank expression to
a half frown and maybe a little
shake of the head if you’re feel-
ing particularly dangerous. But
trust me, there are much fewer
issues with nodding and smil-
ing at a local saying “and then
the avalanche killed 10 people”
compared with solemnly frown-
ing at a joke. - ~

I know this is contrary to
popular opinion, but you can
always blame the ﬁrst circum-
stance on being an idiotic Ameri-
can, whereas the second circum-
stance causes the local to think
twice about trusting someone
who doesn’t like hisjokes.

I Take the time to learn at least
some of the local language. If
you’re travelling abroad for the
sole purpose of leaming~local
languages then you’re in luck,
but if you don’t really have any
interest in learning Thai, Arabic
or British English, then there are
three phrases that will get you
far: “thank you,” “sorry” and
“stupid American.”

Other than maybe some ador-
ably cheesy pickup line, you
don’t really need much more to

survive in a country. As long as
you can point to yourself and
say “stupid American” in the lo-
cal language, even jihadists will
laugh to themselves and brush off
any wrong you’ve caused. Inter-
nationals are so tired of Ameri-
can tourists not taking the time to
even try their local language that
they will adore any attempt you
make at meeting them halfway.
Likewise, when conversing
with internationals, you need to
remember three things. First, talk
as little as possible (this is when
the smile and nod technique
comes in real handy). Second,
[insert country here] surpasses
the U.S. in every category imag-
inable. Third, the speaker is way
funnier and smarter than you. In
any country, the people who take
the most time out of their day to
talk to foreigners are usually a
pretty weird bunch. They make
up for their domestic inadequa-
cies by vicariously living through
their introduction of their home
country to ignorant tourists.
Because of this, they are in-
clined to make up for their low
self-esteem by bragging to these
seemingly ignorant tourists. They

will gladly let themselves go on
for hours about how the United
States is turning into Greece, and
how [insert country here] may
not have the most powerful gov-
ernment, but they have the most
sensible and secretly ingenious
people. While these people go on
about‘how great their country is,
it helps to keep in mind that the
U.S. is ranked number one in the
world for a reason.

The last and most important
piece of advice to remember
when travelling abroad is to fall
in love. Whether you’re falling
in love with the architecture, the
delicacies or someone you meet
at a club, make sure you leave
the country wishing for just a
little more time, and who knows
maybe you can leave your indel-
ible mark on that country. Hope-
fully that mark doesn’t take nine
months to come to fruition. But
even if ‘it does, you have all the
more reason to come back.

In defense of athletes

In light of the death at U- Va, all must be aware of the
actions around them, not just blame student athletes

Dear Editor,

As the details behind Yeard-
ley Love’s tragic death continue
to unfold, the sport of lacrosse
and athletics in general will

continue to receive negative at- ’

tention and scrutiny. The media
has been quick to condemn our
society for granting athletes an
unrealistic sense of entitlement
and mitigating the consequences
of improper behavior.

Among this scrutiny is a re-
cent article in the May 10 issue
of the Phi, which suggests a link
between male student athletes
and violent behavior towards

women. As a men’s lacrosse
player and sports fan, this gen-
eralization troubles me. On this

campus, student athletes are held,

to the same standards of honor,
civility and integrity as any other
student. Actually, in my experi-
ence, student athletes are held
to higher standards of conduct,
since we are responsible for
representing this university and
community on and off the ﬁeld.
In any case, the occurrence
of gender-based violence cannot
be ignored. The important thing
moving forward is the lessons
learned by the tragedy at U—Va.

As classmates, teammates and’

Panhel on Derby’ Days

Sigma Chi is invited to be on task force

\

Dear Editor,

We write to clarify references
in the article “A Bone to Pick with
Panhellenic.”

In May 2009, a letter was
sent from the then-Panhellenic
President to Sigma Chi Frater-
nity requesting changes to Derby
Days.

Our goal was to support Sigma
Chi, Derby Days and, simultane-
ously, support sorority women
by encouraging a safe event in
keeping with the values of our
organizations. '

Panhellenic suggested utiliz-
ing Campus Recreation Ofﬁcials
for Powder Puff, providing sober
drivers to and ‘from all events held
off campus, developing a clear
point system, having t-shirts with
a philanthropic focus and meeting
with Panhellenic during Winter
Term 2010 to review the changes
and have dialogue regarding the
event

There is no doubt that Derby
Days has seen improvements.
However, we still have concern
about both safety and the appro-
priateness of some events.

Panhellenic Council takes
seriously its role of supporting
women by encouraging events
that are safe. We also take seri-
ously supporting Greek Life in
its entirety by doing all we can to
make sure events are carried out
in a manner that reflects chapters’
values.

Panhellenic has formed a task
force to evaluate the women’s
contribution to Derby Days.
Sigma Chi has been invited to
participate on the task force. We

look forward to working with
Sigma Chi in support of women
students and in support of Greek
Life at W&L.

WLUR’s hot tunes

Last-minute suggestions for summer playlist

By WLUR Staff
STAFF WRITERS

Let these great new records kick

start your proverbial summer playlist:
The Hold Steady
Heaven is Whenever (Vagrant)

Tweetable version: This isn’t the
best Hold Steady record, but it’s still
a great one.

Full version: The Hold Steady is
back with what Craig Finn and Co.
have declared as a “new, more stripped-
down sound” in contrast to their previ-
ous sprawling Springsteen-meets-Ken
ouac brand of classic-indie rock. (For
more of that. check out a their previ-
ous records—Separation Sunday, Boys
and Girls in America. Almost Killed
Me, and Stay Positive, in that order.)
They can still do the beefy rockers (see
“The Smidge,” the one with cowbell
that would make Christopher Walken
proud) alongside the tender ballads
(see “We Can Get Together,” deﬁnitely
‘the records strongest moment).

But despite the use of the word
“heaven” in what seems like every oth-
er song, the record feels less complete
to me. They’re still clever in the lines
they spin and the licks they bust out:
catchy-as-hell “Hurricane J” and the
1-2-3 punch of the records ﬁrst three
tracks showcase these traits nicely.
Still, despite these standout tracks, I
find myself only casually listening to
the rest. Sure, The Steady can't ride the
concept album shtick into the ground,
but no matter how repetitive their sto-
ries might be, they’re so damn irresist-
ible.

The Mynabirds

What We Lose in the Fire We Gain

in the Flood (Saddle Creek)

The Mynabirds is the new project of
singer/songwriter Laura Burhenn, who
most recently was half ofthe duo Geor-
gie James. Along with John Davis (ex-
Q and Not U, and currently the driv-
ing force behind Title Tracks, whose
record It Was Easy graced our playlist
back in the winter), those two put out
the LP Places in 2007. It was enjoyable
indie pop, but ultimately it was noth-
ing that hadn’t been done before. In the
end, you could see why they called it_
quits soon thereafter.

As The Mynabirds, Burhenn is com-
pletely in her element on the soul-in-
fused folk record What We Lose in the
Fire We Gain in the Flood. This is right
in the vein of Jenny Lewis, especially
her first solo LP, and Cat Power~l’ll
claim that it‘s as good as anything that
they‘ve ever released—as well as clas-
sic pop touchstones like Dusty Spring-
field and Carole King. Burhenn’s a
terriﬁc songwriter with an absolutely
stunning voice, and this style ﬁts her

much, much better than indie rock ever
did. Produced by Richard Swift, the LP
is neither too sparse nor too cluttered,
with Burhenn’s vocals always leading
the way.

My favorites include “Numbers
Don’t Lie,” “Let the Record Go,”
“Ways of Looking” and “We Made a
Mountain.”

The New Pornographers
Together (Matador)

The inimitable Canadian indie rock
powerhouse that is The New Pomeg-
raphers returns with its ﬁfth album of
power pop bliss. As if a lineup featur-
ing Neko Case, A.C. Newman and Dan
Bejar (Destroyer) weren’t enough to
draw in your attention, Together fea-
tures guest work from Okkervil River
frontman Will Sheff (vocals on opener
“Moves”), St. Vineent’s ‘Annie Clark
(guitar on “My Shepherd”), Beirut’s
Zach Condon (trumpet on “A Bite Out
of My Bed”) and the Dap-Kings (horns
on several tracks).

Be sure to check out the Case-front-
ed “Crash Years” and the Case/New-
man duet “Your Hands (Together),”
as well as Bejar’s always-distinctive
contributions, including “Silver Jenny
Dollar” and “Daughters of Sorrow.”

Tobacco
Maniac Meat (Anticon)

Tobacco, the mastermind behind
techno-pop group Black Moth Super
Rainbow, was hard at work compos-
ing Maniac Meat, the newest addition
to his solo repertoire, while putting the
ﬁnishing touches on BMSR’s newest
and more mainstream record Eating
Us. While listening to Eating Us, I of-
ten wondered how Tobacco managed
to suppress his more experimental side.
The answer is that he didn’t. He fun-
neled it all into Maniac Meat.

This album takes the older, heavier
style of BMSR and makes it heavier.
It’s so thick with guttural fuzz you can
taste it. There is not a single pure noise
in the whole album. Everything is dirty,
affected, distorted, twisted.

The hip-hop/funk drums are simul-
taneously atmospheric and driving.
And well, I would categorize the other
“instruments,” but really it’s all just
intense club noise in chords that are
borderline I2-tone. The funk is unstop-
pable. This stuff will get anyone’_s head
bobbing.

It’s all strange, and it all feels so
right. Maniac Meat has a life of its own,
a solid relentless pulse beating life into
the body of a giant mechanized insect.
A must-play for any DJ looking to un-
earth some truly novel sounds.

THE RING-TUM PHI '5

Women’s lax

Down 13-9 with just seven
minutes left to play, W&L staged
a furious rally, crashing the net
and consistently testing the Blue
Jays’ stout defense. Freeman
scored twice and Mathews once
to cut the deﬁcit to one in the
waning moments.

After senior midﬁelder Ju-
lia Gotwald won the post-goal
draw, fouls were called on two
Elizabethtown players, giving
Mathews a free position shot that
would tie the game. But goalie
Rachel Waldman made the save,
and a follow—up shot by Megargel

sailed high. The Generals would
not get another opportunity, and
Elizabethtown advanced to the
Toumament’s second round.

The Generals’ offense put
steady pressure on the Jays the
entire match, recording 34 shots,
but Waldman’s ll-save perfor-

mance bailed out the Elizabeth-
town defense numerous times.
For Freeman, it was a memo-
rable last game. The senior con-
verted on half of her 12 shots,
giving her 30 goals on the season
despite starting just nine games.
She ﬁnishes her career with 90

goals over four years.

Despite W&L‘s ﬁrst round
exit, the future is bright for the
team. It will lose just four se-

Rockbridge County is Valley League team, the Rockbridge Rapids, includes two VMI standouts

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

With the Washington and Lee
baseball team done for the year,
Cap’n Dick Smith Field lays dor-
mant. That is, however, until the
Rockbridge Rapids make it their‘
home ﬁeld. for this summer’s
2010 Valley League season.

This will be the Rapids’ sec-
ond season in the prestigious
summer league. The Valley
League is supported by Major
League Baseball and consists of
eleven privately owned franchis-
es based in Virginia’s Shenando-
ah Valley. Founded in 1923, the
league has evolvediinto a sum-
mer wood-bat league for college

- players similar to the Cape Cod

League in Massachusetts. Since
its inception, the Valley League
has been a pipeline to the pros

LeBron James: A dream put on

for collegiate players. Well over
1,000 alumni have played pro-
fessionally, including thirteen
Major Leaguers. Players such as
Brandon Inge, Aubrey Huff and
World Series MVPs Mike Low-
ell and David Eckstein all spent
a summer playing in the league
at one point.

Rockbridge’s inaugural cam-
paign last year was a struggle.
Even with a roster ﬁlled .with
players hailing from baseball
powerhouses 3 like Miami (FL),
Stanford and Tennessee, _ the
Rapids stumbled to a 9-33 re-
cord and missed the playoffs.
But a few bright spots were Sam
Roberts and Alan Watts, both of

. whom attend VMI. Roberts led

the team in hitting with a .291

average, while Watts was lights-
out as a reliever, earning All-Star
recognition with a 0.73 ERA and
33 strikeouts in 24 innings.

Both players will be back this
season in the navy, white, and
gold Rockbridge once their VMI
season is completed. Roberts has
shined this year for the Keydets,
receiving recognition as a ﬁnal-
ist for the John Olerud Two-Way
Player of the Year award fo; I.is
work at both shortstop and on
the mound. He also is one of 25
quarterﬁnalists for the Brooks
Wallace award, given to the na-
tion’s best collegiate shortstop.

Thirty-three other players
from schools such as the College
of Charleston, West Virginia,
Davidson and Virginia Com-

monwealth will also play for the
Rapids. Head Coach Greg Ke-
aton says the team is composed
of“guys who really want to play

andihave something to prove”.

Some other notables include
Chris Z_bin and Robert Skinner.
Zbin is a sophomore left-hander
at Southern Connecticut State.
He' posted a 7-2 record with
a 2.29 ERA in 12 starts while
striking out 100 in 78 innings
of work. In addition to being a
ﬁrst team Northeast-10 selec-
tion, Zbin is one of35 candidates
for the Tino Martinez Division
11 Baseball Player of the Year
Award. Skinner is a junior third
baseman for Lander University.
He hit .352 with 32 RBIs and
set school records this year for

runs and walks and was named
an All-Peach Belt Conference
selection.

Beyond Roberts and Watts,
Keaton’s squad is features all
new faces. His coaching staff
for the upcoming season is also
brand—new. The management
team of GM Ken Newman and
President Jim Crothers brought
in Steve Crosier, Evan Wise
and J.R. Blevins to help lead the
Rapids.

“They all have winning base-
ball backgrounds” Keaton said,
“They understand we want play-
ers who play the game hard and
want to prove themselves as D-I
and pro prospects."

Cleveland Cavaliers ’latest playoﬂ failure could be last straw for star LeBron James

By Adam Cancryn
SPORTS EDITOR

It was never supposed to end
like this.

Fresh off a dominant 6I—win
regular season, the Cleveland
Cavaliers were expected to cruise
through the playoffs, dispatch-
ing the lesser teams en route to
an NBA title that would reignite
Cleveland sports and crown LeB-
ron James as the rightful king of
the league. Confetti would rain
down on cheering fans as James
announced his plan to spend his
career in Cleveland, marking the
dawn of a dynasty.

Instead, it ended with LeBron
slinking off the court in Boston,
removing his Cavaliersjersey for
what might be the last time as he
retreated to the locker room.

For seven years LeBron has
ruled the basketball world with
his effortless play and incredible

athleticism. At 26, he has accom-
plished more than most ever do in
a career. But the most important
accomplishment, a championship,
continues to elude him. And after
this latest debacle, LeBron is
likely done waiting for everything
to come together in Cleveland.
Perhaps no team since the
I997-98 Chicago Bulls has been
as good as this year’s Cava-
liers. While other teams have
posted better records, Cleveland’s
superiority extended past the
win column. The Cavs received
consistent contributions from
12 players, easily incorporated
newcomers Shaquille O’Neal
and Antawn Jamison and simply
overwhelmed opponents with
their size and speed. Most games
this season ended with LeBron
resting easily on the bench, jok-

ing with his teammates while
the reserves ﬁnished off another
blowout victory.

But underneath that domi-
nant facade existed a signiﬁcant
weakness that the Boston Celtics
exposed last week: the Cavs have
not yet found a suitable “sidekick”
to support James.

This season, LeBron led the
league in win shares, or the esti-
mated number of victories con-
tributed by a single player, for
the second consecutive year with
18.5. That means that one player
was responsible for nearly one-
third of Cleveland’s wins this
year. The next closest was Ander-
son Varejao, with 8.1.

The supposed supporting cast
of Mo Williams, Shaq and Jamison
managedjust I 1.9 combined.

And when a mysterious elbow

injury limited James’ scoring
ability, the effect of these statis-
tics became clear. No one could
consistently penetrate the Celtics
defense, leaving Cleveland with
no plan beyond giving the ball
to LeBron.

Facing adversity for perhaps
the ﬁrst time all year, the Cavs
could not respond. They were out-
hustled and outworked by spark-
plug point guard Rajon Rondo and
a trio of aging stars.

While it was certainly a disap-
pointing ﬁnish for Cleveland and
its fans, the team’s lack ofquality
role players could mean more bad
news for the Cavs.

Speculation has swirled for
nearly two years around LeBron
and his upcoming free agency.
While the Cavs were busy breez-
ing through the regular season,

it appeared James could not be
happier to stay put. The pieces
appeared in place for a successful
title run.

But the team‘s early exit seems
to have changed all that, and the
players around LeBron that served
as Cleveland’s biggest selling
point are no longer enticing.

Were James to re—sign with the
Cavs, the team would have little
ability to change the personnel
around him. Jamison, Williams
and big men Varejao and J.J.
Hickson will all likely return, and
odds are no major additions would
be made.

On the other hand, New York,
New Jersey, Chicago and the
Los Angeles Clippers have all
emerged as suitors with enough
cash to build a team around
James.

offense that outscored opponents
by 101 goals this year. Goalie

Brown will also return.

son, but it will still be an uphill
battle. The defending champion
Haymarket Senators, along with
the Covington Lumberjacks,
Waynesboro Generals and the
Winchester Royals are all proven
teams that will provide a stiff test
for the Rapids. However, there is
a lot of turnover on these rosters,
so predicting can be tough. Re-
gardless, the Rapids should be
much improved.

With a year under their belts,
$5 tickets, talented local stars
and beautiful Lexington weather,
the Rapids will provide a com-
petitive and exciting baseball
experience all summer long. The
season opens June 4 at home ver-
sus the Staunton Braves.

hold

Though none are nearly as
talented as the Cavs are currently,
each has enough potential to be
an intriguing option for LeBron.
The Knicks have the ability to
sign two maximum contracts,
while the other three already have
players that might potentially ﬁll
that sidekick role James sorely
needs.

Though his future is still ques-
tionable, this much is clear: LeB-
ron’s priorities have changed over
the past two weeks. He will not
choose a team for the challenge, or
the prestige or‘ the loyalty shown
to him. He will choose the team
that is built to win new.

The Washington and Lee men’s tennis team finished the year 16-9 and won the ODAC tournament. The
women also claimed an ODAC title en route to a 19-6 record.

Tennis falls at NCAAs

Women, men eliminated by Emorjy in tourney is third round 1‘

By Jayna Johns
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s men’s and wom-
en’s tennis teams ﬁnished their seasons last
weekend after advancing to the third round
of the NCAA Division lll tournament,
concluding what amounted to a successful
season for each team.

The women’s season ended in Atlanta,
Ga. on Sunday after a 5-0 loss to fourth-
ranked Emory, a team the Generals had
beaten earlier in the season 5-4. W&L is

out the tournament. it marked the 20th
ODAC Championship for W&L Women’s
Tennis overjust 25 years.

In addition to the team championship,
the General‘s brought home several indi-
vidual awards and recognitions. Senior
Lauren Caire was named the ODAC Player
of the Year, and six players were named to
the All-ODAC First Team. in addition to
Caire, sophomores Ellen Yeatman, Ann

Six players from the women’s team and seven from the men’s re-
ceived All-ODAC honors. Senior Lauren Caire was selected as ODAC

Player of the Year.

ranked sixth nationally. it concluded a 19-
6 season for the women.

Most notably, the team dominated in the
ODAC Championships, winning the title
without dropping a single match through-

Morris, Lauren Lukas and Jen Snyder and
senior Blair Brzeski were all awarded the
First Team honor. '

The honors for Caire did not end in the
conference. She was also chosen as an All-

American and one of W&L’s numerous
Student-Athletes, bringing in a GPA of at
least 3.5.

While the season has ended for the team,
Caire and Yeatman’s seasons are not quite
over. They were two of 32 athletes nation-
ally selected to compete in the NCAA In-
dividual Championships for singles com-
petition. The two were also selected to
compete in the championship as a doubles
team, one of only 16 teams chosen.

Five seniors from the team will be
graduating next week. Lauren Dorse‘_ ', Ka-
tie Harris and Lyndsey Johansson will join
Caire and Brzeski.

The outlook for the teams next couple
of years seems promising, as it is loaded
with talented sophomores and ﬁrst-years
with a handful ofjuniors.

The 25th-ranked men's team ended
their season with a 5-0 loss to 2nd-ranked
Emory University, ﬁnishing a 16-‘) season.

Like the women, the men dominated
the ODAC Tournament, dropping just
three games, all of which came in the
toumament’s ﬁnal match against Hamp-
ton-Sydney. Hampton-Sydney had taken
last year’s conference championship from
W&L in addition to a match this season,
so this victory was particularly meaningful
for the team.

Also like the women’s team, the men
had one standout in particular who picked
up a number of honors. First-year All-
American Hayden White was selected as
the ODAC Rookie of the Year, in addition
to being the only General from the men’s
team invited to play in the NCAA Individ-
ual Championships.

The men had seven players selected
to All-ODAC teams, both First Team and
Second Team. For First Team singles,
junior Will Hall and senior Cliff Gaddy
joined White. White was also selected to
the first team in doubles, where Hall and
sophomores Jeremy Becht and Mac Davis
joined him. For the second team, Davis,
Becht and sophomore Michael Freeman
were all honorees for singles, while senior
Alex and sophomore Jonathan Gaffney

were honored for doubles.

In addition to the talents on the court,
two players were also recognized as W&L
Student-Athletes. Will Hall was honored
for attaining a 4.0 GPA, while Hayden
White recorded above a 3.5.

The men will lose only Alex Brooke
and Cliff Gaddy next year.

The three Generals who will continue
their seasons in the NCAA Individual
Tournament willstart play on May 28. The
women will play at the University of Mary
Washington, while White will travel to
Oberlin College for the competition.

Women’s lax comes up short

Late rally not enough as Generals are eliminated from NCAA Tournamen

By Adam Cancryn
SPORTS EDITOR

A late-game surge fell just short for the
Washington and Lee women’s lacrosse
team, as the 14th-ranked Generals lost to
Elizabethtown, 13-12, in the ﬁrst round of
the NCAA Tournament on Wednesday.

Senior attacker Meredith Freeman
scored a season-high six goals and junior
midfielder Emmy Mathews chipped in
four goals and an assist, but Elizabethtown
turned away a free position shot with 2:43
left to seal the victory. V

In a back-and-forth affair that saw six
lead changes, the two teams put on an of-
fensive display. Elizabethtown struck ﬁrst

on attacker Megan Byrnes’ ﬁrst of three
scores. But W&L respondedjust two min-
utes-later, tying it on a goal by junior at-
tacker Wilton Megargel.

The teams would trade tallies before
a three-goal run put Elizabethtown up 5-
3 with just over 12 minutes remaining in
the ﬁrst half. The Generals kept the game
within reach, however, as sophomore at-
tacker Maddie McKaig, Mathews and
Freeman each found the backlof the net off
of unassisted efforts. ‘

Tied 6-6 going into the second half,
Elizabethtown’s offense wasted little time.

The Blue Jays scored just 37 seconds into
the period to take the lead and put W&L on
its heels. Though the Generals would an-
swer with two goals oftheir own, their 8-7
advantage was short lived.

Elizabethtown attacker Stephanie Kreis
took over the game, scoring two goals and
assisting on two more in the game’s last 20
minutes. She would ﬁnish with eight total
points.
