Stemmons plaza gets a face-lift

By Paige Gance
s T A F F w R IT E R

The construction on Newcomb Hall and Hillel
House was expanded last month to Stemmons Plaza
as part of phase two of the university renovations.
Stemmons Plaza includes the area surrounded by
the back of the Colonnade, Leybum Library and
Reid Hall.

Construction on Stemmons Plaza began on April
17 and includes noticeable excavation of the areas
behind the low brick wall on either side of the front
entrance bridge to Leybum. '

All shrubs, trees, retaining walls, sections Of
the brick wall, and the exterior stairs from Stem-
mons Plaza to the library’s lower level 1 have been
removed. The area may look bare now, but only to
make way for improvement.

The University’s plans include the construction

“This project affords us an opportu-
nity to reinvent Stemmons Plaza in

ways that will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt

)

the overall campus atmosphere. ’

MIKE CARMAGNOLA, chief facilities ofﬁcer

of utility housing for infrastructural support of the
Colonnade in the newly cleared space. Since all
mechanical and electrical equipment for the Colon-
nade will be there, this leaves room for classrooms
and oﬂices in those buildings.

“By putting everything from the electrical infra-
structure to air-handling to ﬁre protection in these
utility areas outside of the Colonnade buildings
themselves, we are going to be able to maximize
the program space on the interior of the buildings,”
said Mike Carmagnola, Washington and Lee’s chief
facilities oﬁ°icer.

These new buildings will also help to create new
space on Stemmons Plaza and reduce the need for
vehicle traffic in that area. That means fewer golf
carts and futuristic-looking Tech Services cars that
students need to dodge on the way to the Science
Center.

“This project affords us an opportunity to rein-
vent Stemmons Plaza in ways that will signiﬁcantly
beneﬁt the overall campus atmosphere,” said Tom
Kalasky, director of design and construction at
W&L. “There will be several new spaces thatwill
allow for outdoor classes and casual, impromptu
gatherings on Stemmons.”

Stemmons is already home to the annual activi-
ties fair during O-week, the study abroad fair, part
of commencement exercises and various ice cream
socials. As a central part of campus, it was already
a good location for these gatherings. Once con-
struction is done, it will serve this purpose even i
better and more often.

Unlike the Hillel House and Newcomb Hall,
Stemmons Plaza will not be LEED certiﬁed. LEED
(Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design) is
an internationally recognized ‘certiﬁcation system
that measures how “green” a building is by its
energy savings, water eﬂiciency, CO2 emissions
reduction and overall environmental quality.

This does not mean that the univeristy ignored its
standards of sustainability when laying out plans for
Stemmons Plaza. Much of the limestone that will
be used is recycled from a previous project and the
roofs of the utility building are certiﬁed “green.”

Carmagnola said the university is planning this
and other impending projects to incorporate energy
conservation and sustainability. That commit-
ment includes the creation of new landscape plans,
such as a rain garden in association with the Hillel
House. “This is not only a question of improving
the landscaping, but it is also a water management
tool,” Carmagnola said.

Work on Newcomb is approximately ﬁve weeks
ahead of schedule and Hillel House remains reliably
on schedule. Around late June, faculty and staff will
start to reoccupy Newcomb Hall, and in late July
the Hillel House will be completed. The dedication
is currently scheduled for Sept. 24.

Until completion, however, the front entrance of
Leybum Library will be closed for extended periods
during the summer as the walkway is repaired and

benches and bio-retention planters installed. "Repairs '

on the Northern Auditorium roof will also continue
during this time in order to prevent further leaking.

By the time we return for the summer the famil-
iar construction fence surrounding Newcomb Hall
will be moved back and the walkway between Reid
and Newcomb will return to normal.

Once funding has been secured through private
grants, construction will move to phase 3: the reno-
vation of Payne Hall.

Eric Hoffman, president of the
EC, had a vision: to bring one of his
favorite fast food joints to Washing-
ton and Lee. Now, that vision is one
step closer to fulfillment as Chick-
Fil-A will be serving food out of the
Co-op this coming Wednesday, May

12th, as part ofa pilot program to test .

the franchise’s viability on campus.
After student demand poured in
last summer asking for more diverse
dining options, Hoffman decided
to tackle the project. A friend from
another law school told him that
Chick-Fil-A, a popular Southern
chain, served chicken sandwiches
through dining services once a week

at his school. That’s when the light ,

bulb went off.

“Chick-Fil-A is extremely popular
among students [here at W&L],” said
Hoffman, who mentioned he knew
friends who drove to Roanoke just
to enjoy the fast-food offerings of the
chicken chain. Knowing that the din-
ing services left considerable “room
for improvement,” it seemed only
natural to Hoffman that Chick-Fil-A
would be a perfect ﬁt.

So Hoffman brought the Chick-
Fil-A project before the EC, who sat
on the as-of-yet unhatched idea while
Hoffman contacted campus dining
services and the general manager
of the Roanoke Chick-Fil-A. The
project hit its ﬁrst roadblock when
dining services was hesitant to come
on board with the project, and the
Roanoke group worried about the

l

viability and proﬁtability ofa Chick-
Fil-A program in Lexington.

And while the idea was popular
among many students, other ofﬁcials
at the university were less concerned
and mostly indifferent with the seem-
ingly trivial pursuit of bringing a fast-
food restaurant to campus.

“The attitude has been that if this
is something we can accomplish,
that’s great,” says Hoffman, but
bringing Chick-Fil-A to Washington
and Lee “:..wasn’t on their agenda.”
Hoffman notes, however, that head
of dining services Alex DeSilva and
Dean of Students Dawn Watkins
were both “extremely supportive”
throughout his efforts.

'1... '.._

Wednesday, May 12, Washington and Lee invites you to “Eat Mor Chikin ”

said that the program will come at
a considerable cost, but he remains
confident that Chick-Fil-A could be
a thriving success.

But the courting process is not
yet over. This Wednesday, May 12th,
will mark the ﬁrst pilot run for the
potential.Chick-Fil—A sale through
the co-op. Running from l2-l pm,
the sale will give students a chance
to put their money where their mouth
is and show Chick-Fil-A that students
will back an on-campus initiative for
their business.

ideally, the Roanoke restaurant
will sign on after Wednesday’s test-
run and stait a program for the com-
ing school year to sell Chick-Fil-A

“If we show [Chick-Fil-A] they ’re wel— ’

come, they ’ll come more and more. The

bottom line is this: if we prove proﬁtable

for them, it is only a matter of time before

someone has a permanent presence. ”

SCOTT CENTORINO, EC President

Ultimately, however, the EC
successfully courted both groups
and persuaded Chick-Fil-A to come
visit campus and tour the dining fa-
cilities. Noting that Chick-Fil-A has
stringent standards for the equipment
its chicken is cooked in, Hoffman

out of the co-op on a monthly basis.
Hoffman was optimistic that over-
whelming proﬁts from a monthly sale
would quickly bring an escalation to
Chick-Fil-A‘s efforts here, ultimately
bringing the franchise to W&L full-
time in the coming years.

mung.

Though it may take some time

and a considerable display of interest .

from the student body, the process of
bringing a new fast-food option to
W&L may ﬁnally be within reach. If
the recent EC elections are any indi-
cation, Chick-Fil-A is a top priority
for student voters this year. Current
EC President Scott Centorino, ‘ll,
described the popularity of his pro-
chicken platform last month: “lt’s
funny that it only recently became a
hot topic during the EC campaign,”
said Centorino, “because it’s some-
thing Eric was working on for so
long. 1 decided, somewhat offhand-
edly, to include it in my campaign
as one of my ten commitments, and
suddenly the idea emerged as one of
the campaign’s biggest issues.”

So while Hoffman graduated
from the Law School last weekend,
he has made sure to pass the reigns
on to Centorino and the rest of the
current EC.

Centorino shares Hoffman’s en-
thusiasm and optimism for the proj-
ect, but knows that there is a tough
road ahead before Chick-Fil-A estab-
lishes itself here for the long term.

“If we show the company they’re
welcome, they’ll come more and
more,” he said. “The bottom line is
this: if we prove proﬁtable for them, it
is only a matter oftime before some-
one has a permanent presence.”

A bone to p

ick with Panhellenic

Speciﬁcally forbidding Kappa Delta and Theta from participating in Sigma Chis Derby Days hurt a charity fundraiser

By the Sigma Chi Fraternity
c o L u M N I s T s
Before beginning this article,

Sigma Chi would like to thank ‘

all the students who participated
in Derby Days 2010.

This year, Sigma Chi placed
a special effort on increasing the
philanthropic focus of Derby
Days and we are proud to have
raised a grand total of $10,529

throughout the week. All pro- »

ceeds during Derby Days will
be pledged to The Children’s
Miracle Network, Sigma Chi’s
national philanthropy.

Sigma Chi certainly feels that
the sum raised speaks both to the
dedication of the participating
sororities as well as the capacity
for Greek houses to make mean-
ingful contributions to social
causes. .

That being said, a major point
of contention and concern arose
with Derby Days this year that
we feel must be brought to the
attention of the student body.

At the beginning of winter
term, the Panhellenic Council
made two disciplinary rulings
against Kappa Delta and Kappa
Alpha Theta, placing them both
on social probation through win-
ter term.

While certainly a harsh pun-
ishment, it was justiﬁable in the
sense that it affected the sorori-
ties in question as well as the
rest of the Greek community
equally. However, Panhellenic
also speciﬁcally banned both KD
and Theta from participating in
Derby Days, Sigma Chi’s largest
annual fundraiser and as demon-
strated by the sum raised above,
one of the largest fundraisers on
the W&L campus.

At the same time, Panhel-
lenic permitted both sororities to
participate in any fundraisers or
social events organized by other
Greek organization during spring
term other than Derby Days.

Sigma Chi strongly feels that
Panhellenic’s ruling unfairly
discriminated against our frater-
nity, damaged the reputation of
the event and diminished Derby
Days’ philanthropic potential
despite the fact that we had no
involvement in the events for
which KD and Theta were sanc-
tioned.

Sigma Chi has repeatedly ad-
dressed Panhellenic requesting
their reconsideration on this is-

sue.

Despite our efforts to open a
dialogue, Panhellenic has ignored
our appeals, showing a blatant
lack of respect for our concerns
and demonstrating what we be-
lieve to be an egregious abuse of
their authority.

In this sense Sigma Chi feels
that Panhellenic’s leadership used
their disciplinary ruling to pursue
a misguided personal agenda, ul-
timately choosing to dictate what
they believe is best rather than to

allow the entire student body to I

pursue what clearly is an effec-
tive fundraiser.

Several key issues have been
raised in the midst ofthis conﬂict
and we feel that it is both nec-
essary and appropriate to make
these issues public.

First, any member of the stu-
dent body can appeal disciplin-

nalized.

The fact that at any given time
during the week in which Derby
Days took place, members of KD
or Theta could attend any other
philanthropic or social event be-
sides Derby Days is ridiculous.
As members of the same student
body, Sigma Chi deserves to be
treated equally.

Being a student governing
body, Panhellenic is expected
to recognize imbalances of this
sort and should have limited both
sororities to social probation
through winter term with no ad-
ditional punishment.

On multiple accounts, Sigma
Chi pointed out this imbalance
but Panhellenic chose to follow
through with their ruling,‘know-
ingly discriminating against Sig-
ma Chi and penalizing a fund-

v raiser.

it. Sigma Chi also made this case
to Panhellenic and again they de-
nied us reconsideration on this
account.

In the wake of this sanction,
Sigma Chi repeatedly requested
that Panhellenic open a- discus-
sion regarding the logic behind
the issue and give us an op-
portunity to make our concerns
known.

Certainly, we feel that Derby
Days is a great opportunity for
the W&L Greek community to
demonstrate its commitment to
charity, and as such the partici-
pation of all sororities is highly
valued. '

Panhellenic, however, refused
to engage in a discussion with
Sigma Chi about the sanction,
the rationale behind the decision
to issue it or the valid reasons
presented to reconsider it.

Sigma Chistrongly feels that Panhellenic 3‘ ruling unfairly

discriminated against our ﬁcaternily, damaged the reputation

of the event and diminished Derby Days ‘philanthropic

potential, despite the fact that we had no involvement in the

events for which KD and Theta were sanctioned.

 

ary actions issued by Panhellenic
within three days ofthe decision.
In the case oftheir rulings against
KD and Theta, however, Panhel-
lenic chose not to inform Sigma
Chi of the decision to ban KD
and Theta from Derby Days, nor
did they inform us of our ability
to appeal the ruling.

As"such, Sigma Chi remained
unaware of Panhellenic’s disci-
plinary actions and was never
able to ﬁle a formal appeal. Be-
cause Panhellenic’s meetings
are held in private, it should be
the responsibility of Panhellenic
to inform all relevant parties of
its decisions as well as of their
ability to appeal. This case also
brings into question the alleged
right of a student governing body
to make rulings targeting speciﬁc
events.

As Sigma Chi played no role
in the infractions of KD or Theta,
our fraternity and its sponsored
events should not have been pe-

Competition between sorori-

ties has always been the corner-
stone of fundraising at Derby
Days. Competition motivates so-
rorities to participate in the Pen-
ny Race and buy t—shirts, both of
which donate money directly to
the Children’s Miracle Network.

While any member of KD or
Theta could have made dona-
tions on her own accord, refus-
ing their sororities participation
certainly decreased their incen-
tive to donate.

Furthermore, all participating
sororities were generous enough
to agree to grant a $2 participa-
tion donation per member. The
absence of KD and Theta limited
this grant.

Therefore, we strongly feel
that not allowing sororities to
participate diminished both the
competitive spirit surrounding
the event as well as its philan-
thropic potential, and Derby
Days undoubtedly suffered for

Showing consideration and
respect ‘for their peers should be
a primary concern for an orga-
nization that regularly interacts
with the student body, especially
on the W&L campus. In our case,
Panhellenic failed to live up to
this expectation.

Sigma Chi believes that Derby
Days was unfairly discriminated
against because of unsubstanti-
ated assumptions and hearsay.

Derby Days is not intended
to be an event that belittles or
degrades women. Sigma Chi
values the gender relations we
have built over time, and we
would not host Derby Days if
we felt that it would compro-
mise those relations.

Likewise, we believe that all
Derby Days events are reason-
able and we take speciﬁc care to
review the schedule with soror-
ity oﬂicers beforehand.

Obviously sorority partici-
pation is voluntary in Derby

University wins a prestigious award

F rattingHard. com names W&L as the frattiest school in the country

By Tim McAleenan
co LU M NIST

GeorgeWashington’s $20,000
donation to the school. Robert E.
Lee’s presidency. Big moments,
no doubt. But we’ve got one
more to add to the list. After a
competition that lasted almost a
month and a half, FrattingHard.
corn has dubbed Washington &
Lee the frattiest school in the
country. It was a pretty intense
competition that featured many
solid match-ups, and here’s the
story of how we got there.

Needless to say, we got off to
a good start in the tournament.
We were seeded #2, and we
faced off against Washington,
seeded #15. There were no com-
ments or trash-talking in the fo-
rums during this round, but this
match-up was special because of
our school’s parallel technolo-
gies. »

' On one hand, you’ve got the
University of Washington, where
they’re just now learning about
the breakthrough technology
called “laptops” (look mom, no
wires!), and on the other hand,
you’ve got Washington & Lee,
where it takes about ﬁve minutes

to load a Google search engine

(keep in mind, the ﬁrst round"

took place in March, when you
had to do an Indian rain dance

just to get Microsoft Outlook to»

load, and plus, you had to deal
with the side effects of the rain.)

But, in the end, I don’t think
that really mattered, since we
steamrolled past Washington,
capturing 81 percent of the vote.
We went on to face North Caroli-

na in the second round (I’m sure
they’re delighted to know they
made it farther in the frat bracket
than the actual NCAAS), and we
cruised to the “Frat Sweet Six-
teen” without much difﬁculty.
But cheer up, North Carolina,
you still had the, err, NITs.

Our Sweet Sixteen Match
against #3 seed Florida State was
pretty low key: deep, philosophi-
cal questions about whether Tim
Tebow’s virginity increased or
decreased his frattiness came up
which seamlessly transitioned
into a debate about whether or
not George Bush was the fratti-
est president.

After clarifying the differ-
ence between Florida and Flori-
da State, as well as making a few
references to Stonewall Jackson
and Robert E. Lee, W&L won
easily. We captured 75 percent
of the vote, which according to
user “Shacking with you Sweet-
heart,” was due to the fact the
“Florida is ﬁlled with geezers
who don’t use intemet duh Iol.”
Well put.

After that bit of Florida fun,
we had the chance to pull off
our ﬁrst upset of the tournament,
beating #1 seed Alabama to ad-
vance to the “Fratty Four.” The
banter on the messageboards
was what you might expect- Ala-
bama people talking about how
no one, with the exception of
pretentious, snobby (***censor
***) clowns had heard of W&L,
and W&L students countering
that our Greek fees are prob-

ably higher than their tuition.

Fun stuff. Then we heard from
this guy with the usemame “Roll
Tide Roll” who said “W&L is
like 80 percent Greek. If every-
one there is fratty, then no one’s
frattyl” Hmm, he makes a good
point. If everyone on this earth
is inhaling oxygen, then no one’s
breathing!

After our victory over Ala-
bama, we made it to the Fratty
Four, along with Kentucky,
Southern Methodist and our
friends at U-Va. We had to get
past the University of Kentucky
to make it to the Frat Champi-
onship. The bashing here was
pretty tense as well. One of the
lighter comments came from
“frat papa” who said that “USC
named its horse Traveler. And
USC is so not fratty. I’m giving
this one to Kentucky.”

Yes, but, frat papa, hear me
out on this one. USC named
its mascot Traveler well after
Robert E. Lee named his horse
Traveller. You can’t control what
people do after you. That’s like
saying because the lamest person
you know names her kid Betty
White, Betty White is somehow
less awesome.

After we beat Kentucky
pretty substantially (61 percent),
we marched on to the Champi-
onship round against Southern
Methodist. And you might be
able to guess how the message
boards were for that match. You
know how Robert E. Lee taught
us about duty, honor and civil

behavior? Yeah well, remember,
we were facing Texans.

We heard criticism from
“F RATmonster,” who bantered
that “how does it feel to be the
size of a high school you are
D3? Im sorry but your school
is not fratty, you school is not
SMUs ﬁrst choice...SMU is the
students; ﬁrst choice.” Thanks

FRATmonster, your eloquence '

can only be matched by your
grammar. I wish I could stop
by Rockbridge Middle School
or something and have the
fourth graders try and diagram
that sentence. Umm professor,
what happens when there are no
verbs and the sentences don’t
stop? (Answer: You get a Tim
McAleenan column). Despite
the fact that we routinely faced
schools literally 10 times our
size, we were able to become
the FRATTIEST SCHOOL IN
AMERICA, beating SMU with
54 percent.

1 know, I know. We got to
keep this in perspective. There
probably won’t be any banners
in the commons to celebrate,
and I doubt admissions will be
trumping our school’s frat supe-
riority in their pamphlets any-
time soon.

But for now, I can sit back,
relax and spend my summer
telling my friends, “I may not
be any frattier than you, but my
school sure is.”

Days and they can choose not
to participate if they feel that the
event treats them unfairly.

This year, we made strides
to ensure that ﬂag football was
ofﬁciated by campus recreation
referees and that the results of
events were fairly reported on
a visual scoreboard and on our
website.

All participating sororities
were given the point system prior
to the events.

On this account, it is difficult
for us to reconcile Panhellenic
justifying its punishment on the
basis that Derby Days is a de-
grading event with a purely so-
cial focus.

Student governing bodies
should value participation in
philanthropic events, even if
they do have social aspects as
well. Allowing KD and Theta to
participate in Derby Days and to
work with us to expand the scale
of our fundraising would have
been a great way to allow both
sororities to turn a bad situation
into a good one.

We feel that the sum raised
this year certainly speaks to sup-
pori that sororities have for phi-
lanthropy at Derby Days and we
cannot stress enough how much
we value their continued partici-
pation.

We feel that KD and Theta
would also have made great con-
tributions to Derby Days in terms
of their input, competitive nature
and shared belief in the impor-
tance of philanthropy at W&L.
Indeed, their participation was
sorely missed.

In the future, Sigma Chi

our event are addressed and that
Derby Days makes the greatest
impact possible in terms of fund-
raising.

We feel with utmost certainty
that our event can be further im-
proved through close coordina-
tion with all sororities and we
look to extend such discussions
in the future.

While we hope that our im-
provements and openness will
continue to garner sorority sup-
port for Derby Days, it is clear
to us that Panhellenic has little
interest in working with us to im-
prove Derby Days and seeks only
to further damage our fundraiser.

In no way will Sigma Chi
tolerate the continued abuses of
power demonstrated by Panhel-
lenic nor will we idly allow them
to continue their pursuit of a per-
sonal agenda that we feel runs
contrary to the interest of the stu-
dent body.

When all is said and done,
Panhellenic repeatedly tried to
diminish a fundraiser that raised
over $10,000. We feel that, with-
out a doubt, this sum speaks to
the charitable capacity of all of
W&L’s sororities and is a sum
that puts an exclamation point on
Greek life at W&L.»

Moreover, we hope that the
sum raised proves to Panhellenic
that in the end, they were wrong.

Again, we sincerely appreci-
ate the participation of everyone
involved who helped us make
Derby Days such a great event
this year and we hope to work
closely with all participating so-
rorities in the future to continue
to make Derby Days an outstand-

Summer movies towatch this year

If you are looking for a distraction from your summer job or lack thereof summer blockbusters have the solution

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINION EDITOR

We’ve had a wonderful week
of weather here in Lexington.
The sun has been perpetually out,
and it’s barely ever been cold.
Mean tans have been crafted and
day drinking has been constantly
enjoyable.

However, for most of us, this
nice weather will be relatively
short lived. In two weeks, a good
portion ofus will be offto spend
a summer locked in a cubicle,
Burger King drive-thru station
or ﬂuorescently lighted clothing
store. ‘

Maybe you’ll be lucky
enough to be working construc-
tion or at a camp, but remember
you’re still going to be at work
instead of celebrating your last
two weeks of a six-week spring
term.

I wanted to get fully prepared
for a summer of staring out of a

‘window at the beautiful weather

that I cannot enjoy, so I decided
to go to a movie theater.

One of the few nice aspects
about the summer that doesn’t
include weather is the summer
blockbuster. These movies aren’t
the kind of movies that will bore
you with erroneous details like
an interesting plot, well thought-
out narrative and compelling
characters. -

Instead they use the Ameri-
can dream as their guide to mov-
ie making: just throw in tons of
money and big explosions and
it’s bound to work.

But this year, there are no
“Transformers,” “Harry Potter”
or James Cameron to draw us
into the movie theater. The big
names this year are a bunch of
sequels from moderately popu-
lar franchises and a huge influx
of hopeful franchises trying to
make just enough money to cov-
er their costly budgets. But don’t
fret, I have the answer for you.

Yes, I know that Rotten To-
matoes, IMdB and Metacritic
all have much more hashed out
and more professional answers
for you. V

Luckily for me, ITS at Wash-
ington and Lee has my back. At
my behest, they slowed the inter-
net down so much that the cam-
pus has a whole I994 vibe to: it.

And you know what students
did in 1994? They read school
newspapers instead of ﬁnding
more expert opinions on the in-

ternet. Thanks, ITS!

So now that you are forced to
abide by my opinion of movies
that I have yet to see (I did see
the trailers, so that clearly makes
me capable of summing them up
completely), you can properly
decide how best to spend your
selected two-hour break from
the wonderful weather outside or
from your depressing cubicle.

If you are a Republican, see
“Iron Man 2.” This is the one
movie that I actually have seen,
and can tell you that it really is
the Republican wet dream. _

The entire movie is ‘about
how to properly assign defense
contracts. A Russian is the bad
guy in this movie. When Tony
Stark, the main character played
by Robert Downey Jr., becomes
misguided and distracted, he
hangs up an Obama-like poster
that says lronman instead of
Hope. Stark even asserts that
he has “privatized world peace”
in the beginning of the movie.
I don’t think Libertarians need
porn anymore.

If you missed “Gladiator”
playing on TNT every night this
week, watch “Robin Hood.”

Originally ’ actor Russell
Crowe and director Ridley Scott
wanted to make a Robin Hood
movie centered on compelling
aspects of the Sheriff of Not-
tingham. Unfortunately, Russell
Crowe quickly realized that he
couldn’t make nearly enough
money playing a bad guy, so he
demanded the script be changed
to a mix of “Gladiator” and
“Kingdom of Heaven.” Oh well,
at least Crowe is going to make
archery look ominous.

If your boyfriend doesn’t
know that his only role in life is
to cater only to you, take him to
“Sex and the City 2.”

Just tell him that you want a
special date night between the
two of you and if he’s reluc-
tant, tell him that he can pick
the movie once he gets there. Of
course, once you get to the ticket
line, do the obligatory “I’m still
wearing the pants in the relation-
ship” move and pick the movie
that you want to watch.

My only advice for this mov-
ie is to make sure that. you loos-
en the chain around your boy-

scene where Samantha drags Mr.

If you want to break up with
your signiﬁcant other, see “Just
Wright.”

This movie is neck and neck
with “Furry Vengeance” in the
race for “Gigli” Memorial Atro-
cious Movie of the Year.

You might also like this mov-
ie if you always wanted to see a
movie depicting life on the New
Jersey Nets, or if you thought
Queen Latifah was too sexy to
play a supporting role in a chick
ﬂick, or if you thought Common
should’ve ditched the whole rap
shtick that made him famous and
instead focus on acting and bas-
ketball, or if physical therapy for
two hours somehow excites you.
I think that covers most of you
guys, right?

If you watched “Broke-
back Mountain” and thought to
yourself, “Hey, that guy hook-
ing up with Heath Ledger looks
like the kind of guy who really
needs his own action movie,”
watch “Prince of Persia: Sands
of Time.”

Look, I get it;» you always
wanted to see what it would look
like if Ben Kingsley completely
sold out. I thought “Gandhi” was
overrated, too.

At least this movie has a solid
base of a well thought-out script.
What? It’s based on a video
game? Shit. Prepare for “Alad-
din” meets “Doom.”

If you think unshaven double
chins and sarcastic, pithy one-
liners are sexy, watch “Get Him
to the Greek” and “Cyrus.”

2005 had Steve Carrell. 2007
had Seth Rogan. 2008 had Jason
Sega]. 2009 had Paul Rudd. And
now 2010 has Jonah Hill.

Hill is the next in line to carry

the crown of nerdy, yet hilarious

comedy star. He has two movies
that he’s starring in and both ap-
pear to be pretty good. So, ladies,
if you go to your local Big and
Tall store to ﬁnd a mate, prepare
to be turned on.

If you hate kids and any hope
for the future of humanity, then
you’re in luck! This summer is
ﬁlled with a countdown of an-
noyingly terrible franchises that
will destroy all hope you have
for the next generation.

Let’s start with “Marmaduke

I” (there’s going to be more
of them... just a warning). Itfs
all about a dog who can talk.
WHAT? Dogs can’t talk. They
are thinking way too outside the
box for this one.

Then we have “Cats and Dogs
2,” which ups “Marmaduke” by
making cats talk too. Hilarity is
bound to ensue.

After that, we have “Toy
Story 3,” which will duke it out
with “Shrek 4” to see who can
one-in-four all of my childhood
memories. I

Want to feel good about your
hope for the future? Pixar’s next
three movies from 2010-2012
are all sequels of some kind. If
it worked for “The Little Mer-
maid” and “Cinderella,” it should
deﬁnitely work for “Cars” and
“Monster’s Inc.”. .. right?

If you spent the last decade
convinced that Will Smith and
Jackie Chan should’ve been a
movie together, watch “Karate
Kid.”

I know, you won’t be com-
pletely satiated because “Karate
Kid” only has JackieiChan and
Will Smith’s son, Jaden, but,
still, doesn’t that almost make up
for Chris Tucker being cast in all
of the “Rush Hour” movies? It
doesn’t. Well, at least this movie
can get you prepared for China’s
eventual purchase of America.

If you thought “Van Helsing”
was just that great of a movie,
watch “Jonah Hex.” Both char-
acters wear the same freaking
outﬁt. Both names are three syl-
lables long, and the only differ-
ence between plots is whereeach
character kills the eventual bad
guy. Is Hollywood even trying
anymore?

If you would rather hang out
with alumni than with actual stu-
dents, watch “Grown Ups.”

What isn’t fun about see-
ing has-beens 15 years past
their prime (Adam Sandler and
Chris Rock) try and relive the
glory days by living vicariously
through their families in a setting
that only draws upon nostalgia?

But here’s the catch, during
alumni weekend at least the old
people are paying you for the
fun. In “Grown Ups,” you have
to pay $10 of your own money
to watch these aged comedians
slowlygdecompose on screen for
two hours.

If you don’t have a penis,
watch the new “Twilight.” I think
that pretty much sums it up... I

If you thought “Alien vs.
Predator” was ,a little too much
but “Predator” just quite wasn’t
enough, watch “Predators.” If
there’s more than one, that’s
bound to make the movie better
right?

If you wanted to see exactly
how much money Nicholas Cage
owes the government, watch
“The Sorcerer’s Apprentice.”

For those who don’t know,
Nicholas Cage owes an insane
amount of money in back taxes,
and he’s repaying his debt by
killing as many classic movies
as possible.

In this installment, Cage and

sidekick producer Jerry Bruck-
heimer decide to do to Mickey
Mouse’s segment‘ in “Fantasia”
what that that broken oil rig is
now doing to the Gulf Coast.

If you are the kind of person
who somehow stays focused on
movies after taking a harmful
amount of drugs, watch “Incep-
tion.”

Christopher Nolan’s ﬁrst
movie since “The Dark Knight”
features Leonardo DiCaprio and
Ellen Page (aka Juno). This is
Christopher Nolan’s umpteenth
attempt at trying to put you in an
insane asylum, and he might be
successful if enough people try
and experiment chemically be-
fore this movie.

If you haven’t seen enough
Angelina Jolie movies that have
her playing the following charac-
ter are: innocent yet sexy ‘central
character transforms into seem-
ingly guilty and dangerous and
therefore exponentially more
sexy central character transforms
into emotionally vulnerable with
ostensibly downplayed sexiness
central character transforms into
dominant hero with some article
of clothing missing central char-
acter, then see “Salt.” By the
way, if you could comprehend
that last sentence, you might be
able to understand “Inception.”

You wouldn’t believe it, but
“Salt” is apparently about An-
gelina Jolie playing a sexy CIA
agent with something to hide.

lfyou thought that Julia Rob-
erts should’ve been cast in “Ju-
lie and Julia,” watch -“Eat, Pray,
Love.” The movie is going after

the same exact book club-loving
audience that “Julie and Julia”
worked for.

Who would’ve thought that
most women would like a movie
about food, traveling and love? I
really need to get out more.

If you are a female pedophile,
watch “Scott Pilgrim vs. the
World.” If Michael Cera playing
another teenager in the throngs
of puberty trying to impress
a girl by doing wacky things
doesn’t weed out this select de-
mographic of predator cougars, I
don’t know what will.

If you like watching A-List

factors blow stuff up, watch “The

A-Team.” Liam Neeson pones
on more bad guys, and Bradley
Cooper makes jokes about how
much better at life he is than ev-
eryone else. You’re pretty much
getting what you expect.

If you like watching B-List
has-beens blow stuff up, watch
“The Expendables.”

Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li and
Jason Statham made a movie
about what people have been
saying about their acting skills
for years. They are going to do
to action movies what Adam
Sandler and Chris Rock are go-
ing to do to comedy movies.

The good thing about this
movie is everything you need to
say is in the title. Want to try and
tell your signiﬁcant other that he
or she is... ohhh, how do you say
it?... expendable? Well, now you
have your chance!

Sadly, this movie also aptly
describes this summer’s movie
experience. Enjoy the weather
while you can.

Spring term shouldn ’t b

By Randi Wilson
STAFF WRITER

Every year, James Dick has a
handful of students walk into his
Outing Club office in the heart of
the commons, and ask him what
there is to do.

They never mention it, but
Dick says he has a feeling that
most of them are seniors.

As ﬁrst-years, they say, they
went on a hike here, a canoe
trip there and suddenly college
overcame their free time. Four
years later, they return to his of-
ﬁce, telling him, “I feel like I’ve
missed out.”

That’s part of the reason for
this year’s Outing Club motto:
Are you balanced?

“Don’t study, party or rock
climb too much,” said Dick.

He has nothing against any of
those things but knows that any
in excess can lead to an unhealthy
lifestyle.

“The basement of a frat house
isn’t gonna change,” he says,
encouraging people to explore
outdoors.

We return with advice on how
to navigate the endless stream of
new independent music and ﬁnd
the very best of the bunch:

Caribou
Swim (Merge)

One of the most rewarding
things about listening to Caribou is
that Dan Snaith has never made the
same record twice. In his excellent
review of Swim on AllMusic.com,
‘Tim Sendra describes the previ-
ous LPs from Caribou (originally
known as Manitoba): “the left-ﬁeld
IDM of Start Breaking My Heart,
the shimmering neo—shoegaze of
Up in Flames, the spare Krautrock
of The Milk of Human Kindness,
and the songcraft of Andorra.”

There are elements that mark
those albums as Snaith’s work
throughout, and until 2007’s An-
dorra, there seemed to be a very
logical progression——culminating
in that brilliant release from three
years ago, which won Canada’s
Polaris Music Prize.

If you’re expecting more psy-
chedelic pop on Swim, you’re in
for a huge surprise. But it’s ulti_-
mately a pleasant one: this is the
best Caribou record yet. It’s much
more electronic than anything
Snaith has recorded since Up in
Flames and yet still as accessible
as his pop-leaning recent work.
Let the man himself explain: “The
real substance of the sound of the
record for me is this idea of making
dance music that consists of liquid
elements... Everything is washing
around you while you’re listening
to it.”

Critics and fans are already call-
ing this Caribou’s masterpiece. If
his ﬁrst decade of work is any indi-
cation, Snaith may put out a record
in two or three years that somehow
manages to trump his ﬁrst ﬁve LPs.
But, it’s one of the best records of
2010. Check out “Odessa,” “Leave
House,” “Jamelia” (featuring vo-
cals from Born Rufﬁans frontman
Luke Lalonde) and “Kaili.”

The Living Sisters
Love to Live (Vanguard)

Before I read a brief April 23
NPR-ticle about The Living Sis-
ters, I thought they sounded a bit
familiar: The Bird and the Bee’s
Inara George, Lavender Diamond’s
Becky Stark and stellar solo per-
former Eleni Mandell let their love-
ly voices melt together on Love to

Live, the ﬁrst ofﬁcial release since
they began their collaboration in
2006. With tinges of country, jazz
and soul, these Sisters make beauti-
ful (pop) music together that calls
to mind the melding harmonics of
Jenny Lewis & the Watson Twins’
Rabbit Fur Coat. While_ “Ferris
Wheel” and “You Make Me Blue”
are early standouts, most of the
songs on this all-too-brief record
are worth a spin.
Sam Amidon
I See the Sign
(Bedroom Community)

A superb record from Vermont
native Sam Amidon, who spins
traditional songs and modern
worksel See the Sign features a
cover of an R. Kelly song, “Re-
lief”Ainto beautifully orchestrated
folk. Amidon plays the banjo and
guitar, and his “intimate, unshowy
voice” has been compared to Arthur
Russell (Q Magazine); his songs
are ﬂeshed out by the production
of Icelandic wizard Valgeir Sig-
urdsson and the arrangements of
Amidon’s long-time friend and
collaborator, the composer Nico
Muhly. Truly wonderful music that
will appeal to fans of Nina Nastasia,
Bill Callahan/(smog), and Bonnie
“Prince” Billy (who has also been
known to cover R. Kelly).

First Aid Kit
The Big Black and The Blue
(Wichita)

Finally, First Aid Kit has an al-
burn! The duo, made up of Swedish
sisters Johanna and Klara Soder-
berg, are probably familiar to many
Fleet Foxes fans who have ever
searched “Tiger Mountain Peas-
ant Song” on YouTube—the duo’s
cover is the ﬁrst result, with over
a million views. Sadly, that track
isn’t included on the sisters’ debut,
but the album more than delivers.
Its vocal-heavy folk, with some
slightly instrumentation that only
serves to highlight said vocals, and
for good reason—their voices and
harmonies are phenomenal (PHE-
NOMENAL) and the oftentimes
wistful folk they sing is a perfect
ﬁt. Try ‘‘In the Morning,” “Hard
Believer,” “Heavy Storm,” and “I

‘ Met Up with the King.”

Lexin on farmers market offers freshest fare for residents

Markets on ednesdays behind the Southern Inn bring farmers, and their products, from throughout Southwest Virginia

and very healthy.

Another vendor at the market
is Roller’s Bakery, located in
Waynesboro. Roller’s Bakery is
owned by a Mennonite couple
who bake out oftheir home. They
depend on markets such as the one
in Lexington to sell their bread
and pastries: the bakery does not
have a store. The owners said they
are are pleased with the attendance
at the Lexington Farmers Market

and have proﬁted from setting up
a stand weekly.

The Lexington Farmers Mar-
ket offers many delicious, whole-
some products, and the experience
is fun. This spring term, stop by
the market on Wednesdays and

Growingpains for young Generals

Weather, tough schedule hinder W&L is quest to defend its ODAC crown

By Stephen Peck

The Washington and Lee base-
ball team’s 2010 season came to
an end on April 25 when a ninth-
inning rally versus Lynchburg fell
short. The 8-3 loss ﬁnished off a

nior outﬁelder Anthony Cardona
added.

roller-coaster year for the Gener-
als, one in which the defending
ODAC champs dealt with tough
weather, a young team and a
difficult schedule. The team was
never able to recapture last year’s ‘
magic, and closed out their spring

I with a l4-l9 overall record (8-I0

ODAC).

“It is difﬁcult to say that the
season was not a disappointment,”
said senior captain and starting
pitcher Chuck Davidson.

“We were obviously all disap-
pointed with the overall outcome
of the season. Our record was not
pretty, we came up just short at

At times it was a struggle for
head coach Jeff Stickley’s crew.
The Generals had to deal with an
abnormal winter in Lexington,
one that blanketed Cap’n Dick

Smith field in snow until late '

February. The team then opened
its season with four straight losses
at a tournament in Atlanta. They
were not able to string a two-
game winning streak together
until March 20. And while they
sported a respectable 9-5 record
in home games, they were just
3-12 away from Lexington.
However, there were a number
of memorable moments. Senior

Captain Will Lewis ended his
career at W&L with a spectacular
.403 average. Senior second base-
man John Ditore caught on ﬁre at
the plate in early March, leading
the team in hits, runs, doubles and
batting average (.500) during a
signiﬁcant stretch of the season.
Junior pitcher Gregg Laswell
struck out 46 batters in his 43
innings of work. And on March
23, the Generals wove together
a masterpiece performance and
knocked off Shenandoah, the No.
20 ranked team in the nation, by
a score of 16-11.

But none of that can match the
best moment of the year though
for W&L baseball. In the first
game of the ODAC tournament,
W&L was the No. 1-seeded
Hampden—Sydney. HSC had
swept the Generals in a double-
header during the regular season,
but none of that mattered when
W&L entered the ninth inning
in a 2-2 tie on April 24. Lead-
ing off the bottom of the ninth,
sophomore second baseman
Alston James crushed a long ﬂy
ball. It carried over the fence for
a walk-off home run and an open-
ing round victory. As the team
raucously celebrated at home
plate, the excitement of last year’s
run to the ODAC championship

“I really felt we were going to
win it again,” Davidson said.

“That game was one of the
best all-around baseball games
I have ever been a part of. It
was a total team effort in which
we executed ﬂawlessly in every
aspect of the game,” Cardona
said. “That day, we were a team
who not only wanted to win, but
showed that we knew how to win.
That is what we will be looking
for all of next year”. '

Next year does look bright for
the Generals. The team returns 24

on the team behind Lewis.

“We have the coaches [who]
know what it takes and I think
next year we look forward to
having the perfect combination
of leadership, talent, and attitude
to maximize this team’s potential
and win,” Cardona said.

Those six seniors who are
graduating will no doubt be

missed, however. Captains Da-
vidson and Lewis, along with
Ditore, Nate Adkins, Jim Pl-
antholt and Hunter Serenbetz
put in four quality years for the
program, and won an ODAC
championship along the way.
Their contributions do not stop
at win-loss records. They have
laid the groundwork for future
success in the program through

their commitment and leadership,
two qualities that future teams
will take with them.

Fall baseball will arrive soon,
and expectations are already high
for a team that learned so much
from the adversity thrown at it
this year.

Coming off a dominant 20-8

Union College in what Diamond
called the low point of the sea-
son.

“At that point, the team rallied
together, we as coaches increased
the level of difﬁculty in practice
and the team as a whole trans-
formed into a whole new team
with a new mind-set,” she said.
“I truly believe that embarrassing
loss was the springboard for our
undefeated season in the ODAC

No one on the team has more than

Sports’ saddest stat

Yeardley Love is death puts spotlight on athletes and violence

By Adam Cancryn
SPORTS EDITOR

On Sunday, May 2, Yeardley
Love was an 22 year-old athlete
just days away from her college
graduation. By the next morn-
ing, she/had become yet another
statistic in what is sports’ most
disturbing trend.

Late that Sunday night,
ex-boyfriend and fellow Uni-
versity of Virginia student-ath-
lete George Huguely kicked
down Love’s bedroom door and
forced his way inside. Court
documents released Tuesday
detail a brutal encounter, in
which Huguely assaulted her,
“shaking Love so that her head
repeatedly hit the wall.”

Roommates found Love’s
beaten body early Monday,
her face badly bruised and her
right eye swollen shut. Police
described the cause of death as
blunt force trauma.

Charlottesville police arrest-
ed Huguely, a senior lacrosse
player, the next morning. Since
then, the investigation into
Love’s tragic death has painted
a grim portrait of Huguely as a
student-athlete whose sense of
entitlement and above-the-law
attitude left him unprepared and
unable to deal with any amount
of failure or rejection.

By all accounts, Huguely
was brought up through a sys-
tem that told him he couldn’t
fail. Growing up in suburban
Chevy Chase, Md., he went to
high school at the $29,000 per-
year Landon School. The son
of a successful businessman,
he vacationed at his family’s
$1.2 million house in Palm
Beach, Fla. He was hugely
popular in high school and col-
lege, according to friends and
acquaintances. At every step
along the way, George Huguely
experienced only the best.

in school and on the ﬁeld,
Huguely also was the best. At
Landon, he was a three-time
honor roll student, quarterback

ofthe football team and an All-
American lacrosse “prodigy.”
U-Va. recruited him to play for
their revered program, which
is currently ranked No. l in
the country. In his 22 years,‘
Huguely rarely experienced
failure. ’

But while he might have
been the king of his own little
world, cracks of insecurity and
egotism showed through. in
November 2008, an extremely
drunk Huguely was arrested in
front of a Washington and Lee

relatively few cases of student-
athletes murdering their peers,
studies have shown that athletes
are more likely to engage in
violence against women than
the general population.

In a Benedict-Crosset study,
researchers tracked 30 major
Division I universities over
three years. Though male stu-
dent-athletes made up just 3.3
percent of the college popu-
lation, they were found to
represent one-fifth of sexual
assault perpetrators and 35

fraternity house. During the
incident, he berated the female
police officer, hurling racial and
sexist obscenities and threaten-
ing to kill her. At one point he
wrestled her to the ground, forc-
ing the ofﬁcer to use her Taser.
in addition to being drunk in
public, he was charged with
public swearing and resisting
arrest. Friends of Huguely told
ABC News he had a temper and
problems with alcohol.
And so when Love ended
their relationship, that entitle-
ment-driven anger reared its
"head once again, combining
with what police expect to ﬁnd
was both alcohol and drugs to
result in her assault.
Unfortunately, Huguely is
not an anomaly. While there are

percent of domestic violence
perpetrators.

This ﬁnding was supported
by a Georgetown study that
found its student-athletes be-
ing arrested and charged with
violent assault at double the
rate of the rest of the campus
population.

in Huguely’s case as well as
many others, these statistics are
a result ofa system ofprivilege
that provides athletes with
everything and teaches them
nothing. In the hyper-gloriﬁed
world of sports today, athlet-
ics are often no longer about
building character but building
popularity, money and prestige.
Pro athletes are paid hundreds
of millions of dollars. College
athletes are campus celebrities,

showered at some universities
with alcohol, drugs and women.
Talented high schoolers are
given a free ride to college
before they’ve even begun the
ninth grade. Some might argue
that it’s merely a consequence
of sports as a business, but nev-
ertheless it is stunting athletes’
growth as human beings.
Perhaps the saddest part of
all of this is that our culture
has largely complied with this
shift. It is a compliance that
takes many forms. Sometimes
it is active participation: there is

extensive evidence that a janitor ’

scrubbed the bathroom clean

J minutes after Ben Roethlis-

berger’s alleged sexual assault
ofa woman in a Milledgeville
bar. Sometimes it’s a passive
attitude: of 168 sexual assault
allegations against athletes
from 1992 to 2003, just 22 went
to trial and only seven ended in
convictions.

But most times compliance
means ignoring the warning
signs. A Washington Post story
cited an altercation with Love
two months before her death
in which the two had to be
separated. And in the days fol-
lowing their break-up, Huguely
sent Love harassing e-mails and
later stole her computer. Police
later found it, along with a red-
stained U-Va. lacrosse T-shirt.

For those who follow sports
at any level, it is difﬁcult not to
idolize those on the ﬁeld or the
court. Admiration is not wrong.
But allowing that admiration
to perpetuate the acceptance
of poor and sometimes violent
behavior is a habit we must all
strive to end.

Yeardley Love’s death is a
tragedy, but it will be equally
as tragic if we learn nothing
from it.

A defensive mindset

Generals ’ 15th-ranked defense set the tone for 2010 season

The Washington and Lee
Generals men’s Lacrosse team
ended their 2010 campaign with
a 15-7 loss to conference rival
Roanoke College in the ODAC
tournament semiﬁnals.

But while the Generals (1 l-
6, 4-3 in the ODAC) fell short
of the conference title and an

short of some of our goals, the
men on the team really came
together and had a great time
on and offthe ﬁeld.”

Of the Generals’ six losses,
only one was decided by more
than three goals. Much of the
team’s success was due to
W&L’s 15th-ranked defense,

Will Keigler ended his senior
season ranked as the 6th all-time
point-getter in W&L lacrosse
history with 212 points (102
goals, 110 assists). He is just
one of four Generals ever to
score both over 100 goals and
100 assists. He earned lst team

and season highlights.

while Wernecke earned an
honorable mention. it was the
second consecutive second
team honor for Smith.

McCabe said it will be sad
to see such a strong senior class
graduate this spring.

“The seniors performed very
well throughout their four years
with the program and their
presence and impact on the
team will be lasting,” he said.

Despite the enormous
amount of leadership and tal-
ent that will be graduating at
the end of this academic year,
the Generals are optimistic go-
ing forward.

“Many ﬁrst year and sopho-
mores played well and were
regular contributors on and off
the ﬁeld,” McCabe,said.

Promising young talent
and commitment is a staple of
a strong program, and W&L
expects to maintain that. With
the season ﬁnished, fans can
look forward to yet another
promising season next year
when the Generals will return
a signiﬁcant amount of starters
and key contributors.
