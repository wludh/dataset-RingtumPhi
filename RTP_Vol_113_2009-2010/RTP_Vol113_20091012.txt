partying

Panel to discuss
interacting with law
oﬁicials after drinking

By Eleanor Kennedy
smrr wmrzn

Students, Alcohol and the Law, an event which
will include a panel discussion followed by a op-
portunity for students to voice their questions, com-
ments and concerns about enforcement of drinking
laws in Lexington, will take place on Tuesday
October 13 at 7:30 pm. in Stackhouse Theater.

The panel will be composed of members of the
local and county police offices, a local lawyer and
the presidents of the EC and SJC. The panel will
discuss a number of scenarios which students com-
monly face in Lexington and then open the ﬂoor up
for any questions from the audience.

Junior Stephanie Brown is one of the coor-
dinators of the event. Brown said that she and
SJC president Crighton Allen discussed the idea
of a forum about what rights and responsibilities
students have when they are consuming alcohol,
and what they should expect in interactions with
police officers.

“The purpose of this meeting is
to ensure that W&L students are
fully aware of both their rights
and responsibilites should they
ever ﬁnd themselves in a situa-
tion involving alcohol and a law

enforcement oﬁcer. ”
STEPHANIE BROWN, junior

Brown and Allen brought the idea to Dean
Watkins, who informed them that EC president Eric
Hoffman had already been in contact with the police
and the Lexington community on this issue. Brown
and Allen contacted Hoffman, and the three planned
the Students, Alcohol and the Law event.

Brown said: “The purpose of this meeting is to
ensure that W&L students are fully aware of both
their rights and responsibilities should they ever
ﬁnd themselves in a situation involving alcohol
and a law enforcement ofﬁcer.

“It is our hope that common ground can be
reached on what constitutes an appropriate in-
teraction between students and law enforcement
officers.”

She also hopes that the discussion at the meet-
ing will “help students understand how to handle
encounters with the police, increase students’
knowledge of their rights, and underscore the po-
tential consequences of their actions with regards
to the Honor System and the University’s Conduct
Policies.”

Issues that will be covered at the meeting in-
clude drunk in public laws, the effect of the Honor
System on interactions with police, the W&L strike
system and the authority of police at Traveller bus
stops.

The panel has certain scenarios that they have
developed for discussion, but Brown said they
would appreciate any suggestions from the student
body.

Brown said she is hopeful that a large number
of students will attend, since there are currently 99
students planning on attending with another 176
considering coming.

No matter how many people show up, Brown
still believes “that even if it’s only a few people who
learn more about their rights and the law, and can
communicate that to other people, then the event
will have been a success.”

More information about the event can be found
on the Facebook event with the same name. Just in
case some students need more incentive than the
value of knowing their rights in an interaction with
police, food will be provided.

 

Many agree that partying can be
characterized as a huge part of W&L
culture. Partiers head straight to fra-
ternities to participate in various so-
cial activities. Solo cups in hand, stu-
dents seem to think that the fun can
go on for hours. However, several
parties this year have been heavily
regulated, and some have even been
shut down by public safety ofﬁcers.

Rumors of parties being shut
down by campus security ofﬁcers
and students being given strikes by
these ofﬁcers due to their deﬁance of
university policy have permeated the
campus.

According to the Student Right-
To-Know, Equity in Athletics and
Campus Safety (“Clery Act”) Reports,
a public safety officer, “while respon-
sible for the enforcement of rules and
regulations prescribed by the univer-
sity, are not empowered with arrest
authority.” The “Clery Act” also says
that students are “considered adults
and are expected to abide by the laws
of the Commonwealth of Virginia
and federal statutes concerning pos-
session and use of alcohol, illegal
drugs and other unlawful controlled
substances.”

Sigma Phi Epsilon’s band party on
Friday, Sept. 18, though not ofﬁcially
shut down, was heavily regulated by
public safety ofﬁcers. The members

of the fraternity were shocked when a
public safety officer arrived on scene.
Brett Holton, social chair of Sig Ep,
said he believed that they were fol-
lowing what they believed to be the
risk management rules, only to be
confronted by ofﬁcers. When the of-
ﬁcer arrived, underage attendees left
the party when alcohol was not being
served, leaving a mere seven people
at the soirée. The party continued un-
til its scheduled time.

Holton and his fraternity were
under the assumption that as long as
an alcoholic drink was in a Solo cup,
“security wouldn’t bother you.” They
were later informed by a female se-
curity ofﬁcer that that was never the
case for university policy. Sig Ep had
its safety procedures in place, includ-
ing designated sober ofﬁcers, sober
drivers and fraternity brothers on se-
curity.

“It seems as though security is
changing the rules in the middle of
the game and penalizing fraternities
for doing things as they’ve always
done and never been punished for be-
fore,” said Eleanor Kennedy, attend-
ee of two separate parties that were
heavily regulated or shutdown.

It has also been rumored that one
of Sigma Nu’s cocktail parties and
Pi Kappa Phi’s Late Night have also
been shut down—by the very same

public safety ofﬁcer who was present
at Sig Ep’s party.

“The party was singlehandedly
shut down by one security officer:
Kay Bostick,” said Sigma Nu Social
Chair Ken Delecki. He reported that
two other ofﬁcers went to the party
earlier in the night and saw no reason
for concern. “It seems that this secu-
rity officer thinks registering a party
gives them license to harass us as
they please.”

Bostick said that she does not
believe that she is doing anything
outside of the boundaries of her job
description.

Sig Ep is now resorting to pri-
vately hiring other security ofﬁcers to
regulate their parties.

It has been reported that Bostick
is under investigation. Though other
fraternities have formally complained
about the ofﬁcer, these rumors cannot
be conﬁrmed.

Bostick regularly makes multiple
appearances at parties in order to fur-
ther enforce what she believes to be
university policy. She says that she
has not found any parties to be com-
plete compliance with the rules.

“I think it’s only fair if the stu-

‘dents write the rules, and they agree

upon the rules, they ought to com-
ply,” said Bostick, who advises stu-
dents to “party with common sense,

curity cracks down

Public safety takes stricter stance on parties, frats complain

sound judgment and drinking within
personal limits.”

Holton said he considers the tight
regulation to be a hassle.

“If you deny students alcohol in
a safe controlled environment, they
will just go off campus where they’re
no longer in a safe place. They will
make stupid mistakes,” Holton said.
“I think it’s just forcing people into
bad situations.”

Perhaps part of the reason for the
sudden and strict crackdown is due
to “a movement from the administra-
tion of the university to gain a better
hold on compliance to the rules and
regulations pertaining to underage
consumption of alcohol,” according
to public safety director, Mike Young.
A refusal of compliance to the policy
may lead to a party being shut down
and written reports, which may result
in issued strikes or a review of the
fraternity by the IFC.

However, IDs are not being
checked at the door because of the
university’s philosophy of student af-
fairs.

“We want them to be able to enjoy
social events,” said Young. “We want
them to obey the rules and the laws.
We lay it on the students to take their
own responsibility to make sure that
that happens.”

Continuing toreform SF HB

Students and professors offer opinions and solutions on how to ﬁx the hearing process

By Eric Gehman
STAFF WRITER

The Student Faculty Hearing
Board (SFHB) review committee
held its second open forum on Fri-
day, Oct. 9. This was a chance for
students, faculty and other members
of the W&L community to offer their
suggestions and opinions about how
the University handles cases of dis-
crimination, harassment and sexual
misconduct.

Present at the meeting were a vari-
ety of representatives from all areas of
the campus, ranging from the depart-
ment of Women’s and Gender Studies
to former members of the SFHB and
various student- groups, all hoping to
effect change in a system many con-
sider in dire need of reform.

Co-Chair Dean Rod Smolla ex-
pressed that the forums are meant to
help the committee formulate its sug-
gestions and stressed that the group is
still in the process of gathering infor-
mation before it convenes to decide
what reforms to include in its ﬁnal
report.

The ﬂoor opened after a brief in-
troduction of the committee and a
statement from Smolla about the pur-
pose of the meeting. First to offer her
thoughts was Professor Robin -LeB-
lanc, former head of the Women’s and
Gender Studies program and member
of both the Politics department and
the Student Affairs Committee.

LeBlanc criticized the closed na-
ture of the committee, sharing her
concern that “... the structure of the
current ad-hoc committee doesn’t
avail itself to the wealth of expertise
and training possessed by some of
the undergraduate faculty and student
groups.”

“It has now long been the case at
W&L that some students and faculty
are informed, organized and active
on issues such as sexual assault and
harassment,” LeBlanc said. “When

we reach the stage at which these
informed, organized and active com-
munity members are regularly con-
sulted and formally included in deci-
sion making relevant to the expertise,
I will see our institution as having
more honestly committed itself to the
values of civility and honor we aspire
to hold dear.”

The second person to comment
was Philosophy and Women’s and
Gender Studies professor Melina
Bell, who offeredia wealth of sug-
gestions as to how the SFHB should
be overhauled. Bell called it “highly
problematic” that students do not
have more involvement in the se-
lection of SFHB members and even
went on to suggest that a direct elec-
tion of student board members would
be preferable to the current system, in
which the EC appoints two students
to serve on the board and recom-
mends faculty members for appoint-
ment by the Provost.

“I have spoken,” said Bell, “with
many women students who believe,
mistakenly, that as long as one does
not lie, cheat or steal, the EC is ir-
relevant to their lives. However, they
recognize the relevance of the SFHB
to their lives.”

Bell urged the committee to strive
for more consistency in the sanc-
tions and outcomes of cases that the
SFHB hears. She called for a smaller
board composed of a chair, two stu-
dents (one male, one female) and
two faculty members, minimum and
maximum penalties, as well as clear
deﬁnitions of offenses “framed... on
some concepts established in law or
other adjudicatory settings.”

Another vocal participant in the fo-
rum was CAIR Counselor and W&L
alumnus Joel Shinoﬁeld, who asked
for a smaller, faculty-only commit-
tee, more speciﬁc training methods

on sexual assault to be administered
before the start of the school year and
an “independent counsel with no af-
ﬁliation to W&L” for legal advice. He
deplored the size and composition of
the current SFHB, saying that many
students who come to him seeking
help are unwilling to testify in front
of a board of so many members of the
campus community, due to the sen-
sitive and often emotional nature of
such difﬁcult cases.

Kevin Corn, head Resident Advi-
sor for First Years, agreed, claiming
that “we have one of the largest hear-
ing bodics of these sorts of cases,”
and that “students don’t have any
trust that the board will bring any sort
ofjustice.”

Other students voiced similar
opinions, including KEWL president
Catherine Kruse.

“Frankly, I don’t think the SFHB
should have students on it,” she said.
“We, as college students, don’t have
the capacity, knowledge or experi-
ence to handle the cases as well as
others who understand the victim’s
mentality [and] who can stand as role
models for relief.”

The idea that a faculty-only board
would increase the number of re-
ported cases was a widely supported
view, though this also raised concerns
about violating W&L’s long-standing
tradition of student government.

Regardless of the board’s com-
position, however, most agreed that
more thorough training is needed for
all members prior to the start of the
school year and that the SF HB should
be more active in reaching out to the
student body.

Dave Leonard, Dean of First Year
Students, discussed his concern about
the campus climate and attitudes to-
ward alcohol and sexual conduct.

“We very clearly have a lot of cul-

tural issues,” he said. “The culture is
very muddy, and the time has come
to address the situation.” Public pro-
motion to raise awareness about sex-
ual harassment and assault from the
SFHB, similar to the SJC’s campaign
to reduce drunk driving, was also
widely recommended.

While a wide variety of opinions
and criticism were shared throughout
the two hour session, Smolla made it
clear that the committee is still seek-
ing the help and advice of the W&L
community.

“We have been very impressed
with the honesty, thoughtfulness and
intensity of the comments we have
received in our two open sessions,”
Smolla said. “We have already sched-
uled, and continue to schedule, many
additional meetings with groups and
individuals who have asked for the
opportunity to speak privately with
the committee. We are learning a
great deal through the process, and
we continue to encourage the widest
possible participation from the cam-
pus community.”

Still, some expressed concern and
doubt that the student body could
play any signiﬁcant role in the reform
process without any representation on
the board from knowledgeable groups
in the undergraduate community.

As Kruse noted, “it is hard to com-
ment on the process because none of
us really knows what is going on.
While I appreciate that they are ac-
cepting input from clubs like KEWL
and the WGS faculty, none of us are
on the board, so we don’t even know
how much our opinions count.”

Those who wish to submit com-
ments or suggestions can do so by

Why do we need a date to Homecoming?

Butler asks why Homecoming is centered around nothing but fraternities and, for girls, looking pretty for a date . I

By Alelsha Butler
c o L u M N I sr

Ah, Homecoming... that an-
nual event.

That event that draws hordes
of alumni and, apparently, their
toddlers and infants, to cocktail
parties, wine tastings and late-
night band parties. (I’m not kid-
ding. On Saturday night I saw a
newborn at a frat party.) What do
we think of it? How important is

it in the scheme of social events '

that take place around here?
What is the meaning of Home-
coming?

While kicking around these
topics with a few guy friends
who happen to be in a fraternity,
they asked the eternal, unanswer-
able question that hovers around
the social events at W&L: Why
do we need dates for something
like Homecoming?

One of the guys I was talk-

ing with piped up and said it’s
because the undergrads need
to prove to the alurrmi that the
fraternity is still “doing well.”
What does that mean? It seems
that success, in the frat world,

business transaction of sorts.
Because sorority nationals do
not permit alcohol to be served
in sorority houses, women are
not able to host equivalent social
events. Much less frequently do

full roster backing us up. And
everybody who knows anything
about sports knows that winning
an away game is always a little
tougher than a home game.

So, what should we do? Call

It seems that success, in the frat world, is measured by the number of

(attractive) girls that attend any given party or social function.

is measured by the number of
(attractive) girls that attend any
given party or social function.
Like video games to little kids,
the more you have the cooler you
are.

Guys need to prove their
studliness, and girls need a place
to party, so we come up with a

we have the ability to socialize
with our entire Greek afﬁliation,
and the fact that we need to play
the social game at guys’ houses
always makes us the visiting
team.

We never get to play the
world’s most complicated game
on our home turf, or with our

up sorority nationals and tell
them to change their policies?
That probably wouldn’t work,
but you’re welcome to give it a
try.

Instead, maybe we should
reevaluate our partying needs:
why do we need dates? What do
we have to prove? That, male or

female, we’re smooth enough to
harness somebody to us for a 48-
hour period? Score.

Most of the time, I hear
people coming back from date
functions with indifferent or ac-
tually unpleasant stories, and the
people who simply go in groups
of friends, mixed-gender or not,
seem to have the best time. The
pressure to be polite, gracious
and catering to another person’s
enjoyment is so much less if it’s
only your own good time that
you’re worried about.

As one of the guys who helped
me with this article said, Home-
coming is supposed to be about
the alumni. We’re supposed to
welcome them back and enter-
tain them. It provides a good op-
portunity for us to network, and
it lets them feel like they’re 21

again. (Although at W&L, being
21 really isn’t an issue.)

As we all know, the social
scene can get hectic and stress-
ful, especially when we’re host-
ing several graduating—classes’
worth of guests, and throwing
in the added pressure of ﬁnd-
ing dates is kind of unneces-
sary. Most of the events during
this weekend were standing-up,
moving-around kinds of affairs,
not sit-down dinners and hotel
reservations. We would all have a
much better time if, in the future,
we saved the date-snaring for
the really serious, sophisticated
social events. Like Christmas in
the Country. Or Fancy Dress. Or
Pledge Formal.

You know, “classy” stuff.

Welcome to the reality of rape at Washington & Lee

A W&L student shares her experience with rape and begs for an end to the shocking culture of tolerating assault

By Anonymous

Let’s pretend that this year
one out of every four Washing-
ton and Lee students had their
cars stolen. Wouldn’t there be a
campus-wide outrage that pen-
etrated both the students and
administration? We would prob-
ably make national news for that
many car thefts, and the number
one in four would be signiﬁcant.
Why then is this not the reaction
to the number of sexual assaults
that take place on our campus ev-
ery year? Our numbers are about
one in four. Why are these num-
bers so unimportant?

Do not enough victims speak
out? Do we consider it such a me-
dial problem that we are unwill-
ing to do start a dialogue about
ﬁxing it? Do we not understand

how it happens? Do we think it
couldn’t happen to us or to our
friends? Again, our numbers are
about one in four, so it probably,
and almost certainly has hap-
pened to your friends].

My story is not very differ-
ent from that of many women or
men on this campus. I apologize
in advance if it makes you un-
comfortable to read, but some-
thing needs to be done. Maybe if
people are able to identify with
my story, they will realize that
sexual assault is a problem on
our campus. It is a problem that
needs to be addressed. We cannot
ignore it any longer in hopes that
it will go away.

I had met a guy who I thought
was intrigming, and we started to

spend more time together. We
did laundry together once and
had kissed a few times. I liked
how sure of himself he always
seemed, and his friends were
pretty solid. We had hooked up
sober a few times, and when he
asked me to have sex, I declined,
making it clear that I wanted to
wait until I was married (just a
personal preference, but his dif-
ferent views on sex were okay of
course). When we had had a few
drinks, I had the same preference
not to have sex; he tried to push
my limits a few times, but when
I stood my ground, he stopped
asking and settled for other types
of physical affection.

One night, we went to a bar
together with a few friends. Be-
cause I was under 21 at the time,
he bought me shots all night
which I, thinking I was of the
W&L drinking caliber, accepted
without a thought to how much
I was consuming. He had a few
drinks, but was nowhere near
as drunk as I because he had fo-

cused his efforts on getting me
drunk. We went back for the night
where I threw up, a clear sign for
me that my body was not able to
handle the amount of alcohol I
had previously consumed.

We lay in bed and kissed for
a little while when he began tak-

powerless to stop him.

drunken state that I did not want
to have sex (which at this point
should have been crystal clear in
his mind) and he persisted. “Just

and taunted me with “So, babe,
how does it feel not to be a vir-
gin anymore?” and I could only
stare at him. I laughed it off for
a few days, unable to cope with
the experience. Sound like rape
to you?

Rape... what a taboo word.
It conjures thoughts of violence
and sleazy old men taking advan-
tage of stupid, vulnerable wom-
en. On our campus, though, it is
sometimes as simple as someone
saying no, the other person hear-
ing the no, understanding the no
and still deciding that his or her
physical gratiﬁcation is more im-
portant.

I did not want to have sex. He
knew that. In the heat of the mo-
ment I never said yes. I also nev-
er said no with a “Come on baby,
I actually meant yes” grin—my
no was clear. There are men
and women on this campus who
share the same story or share a
similar one.

on our faces and even continue to
hook up with people~—shocking.
Again, the numbers on this cam-
pus are high. Let’s do something
about it.

The “we just don’t care” generation

As 2010 and a new decade loom, Bullitt looks back on characteristics of his generation

By Stockton Bullltt
co LU MNIST

I don’t know if you’ve
checked lately, but we are two
and a half months away from a
new decade. 2010 does not come
with the same amount of hype as
2000... Nevertheless, it still mat-
ters.

Since you are probably spend-
ing most of your time dealing
with the here and now, you might
not have noticed how truly im-
portant this decade was to our
generation. The Baby Boomers
had the 1960s to ﬁgure them-
selves out. Generation X had
the 1990s to complain about the
world and make their everlasting
mark. Our generation? We had
the 2000s.

If you really stop and think
about it, the last 10 years were
primarily about our generation.
Basically, everyone who is in the
age range to be an undergrad here
has been the cultural center of at-
tention for the last 10 years.

Don’t believe me?

Who do you think 98 Degrees,
O-Town, Christina Aguilera, and
Destiny’s Child were marketing
to when they all released music
in 2000?

Why do you think the gradu-
ating classes of “The OC.” and
“Gossip Girl” were 2006 and
2009 respectively?

Why did Nickelodeon and
Cartoon Network suddenly not
have any programming ideas
once we hit puberty?

Why did the R—Rated come-
dies start coming back into fash-
ion once we did hit puberty?

Starting to make some sense?
Now, some of you may be think-
ing that since you were anywhere

from the age of 8 to the age of 12
in 2000, you can’t really be the
most important cultural entity.
You are supposed to be in your
prime from 16-29, and anything
outside of that does not really
count.

While that argument does hold
some merit, let’s face it: from our
perspective, life basically ends
once you leave college. Seniors
are already looking for jobs, and
most have already come to terms
with the reality that their gradua-
tion present will most likely be a
minivan and a 401K portfolio.

Face it. These last ten years
were basically all geared to peo-
ple who were born between 1987
and 1992. We just matter more
than everyone else.

So while you are contemplat-
ing that pretty heavy fact (and
maybe wondering how the hell
I was able to remember who 0-
Town was), let me tell you anoth-
er pretty interesting thing about
our now clearly deﬁned genera-
tion: we have a catch phrase!

Other famous generations
have had catch phrases as well.
The Baby Boomers had “free
love” and Generation X had
“keeping it real.” Other gen-
erations, especially the lesser-
known ones might also have had
catch phrases, but since by now
they are over 30, do we even care
anymore? Yeah, I thought so.

Anyway, our generation,

which I like to call Generation
“ADDerall” (I’m not sure if it’s
going to catch on), has a catch
phrase: “I don’t even care.” Now,
you might not have said this
phrase that many times in your

life, but that’s only because you
probably substituted it with “give
an [expletive].”

And since apparently curses
still aren’t allowed in newspa-
pers, I’m going to stick with
“care.”

Being raised in incredibly
passive-aggressive households,
we were trained from birth to not
even care. In pre-school, the Baby
Boomers were taught to share
the ﬁre truck with their friends.
The Generation Xers were taught
to ﬁnd a true friend that they
could trust to share with. Our
generation? We were taught that
it doesn’t really matter whether
someone takes our ﬁre truck or
not because N64 was much more
important anyway.

This example isn’t supposed to
imply that we were more spoiled
as children. Every generation’s
lifestyle has it a little better than
the generation before it, but we
can now complain that the iCarly
generation has life way too easy.

Our generation was deﬁnitely
not an outrageously spoiled gen-
eration. Instead, we just ﬁgured
out a way not to care who was
playing with our ﬁre truck. Sim-
ple as that.

Now that we’re grown up, we
still show that we just don’t care.
Back in the good ole days, the
Baby Boomers at parties would
try and convince members of
the opposite sex to come back
to their place to listen to the Jimi
Hendrix Experience, take some
substances, and go through with
“free love” ﬁrsthand.

A decade ago, the Generation
Xers would invite members of

the opposite sex to come back to
their place to listen to some qual-
ity grunge music, drink some
coffee, talk about real things in
the world like democratization
and globalization, and maybe if
there was some time left over, get
to really know each other. Basi-
cally, Generation X was that gen-
eration who used italics a little
too much.

When we try and seduce po-
tential mates at parties, we use
slightly different tactics to do so.

A typical pick-up line among
the kids in our generation goes a
little something like this: “Hey,
I mean, you don’t have to, but if
you want to come by my place,
we can just chill for a while, lis-
ten to a little Jack Johnson, and
I don’t know, maybe something
will happen. I mean, it’s not that
big a deal and I don’t really care,
but there is this funny Youtube
video that you’d probably like,
and who knows what can happen
from there?”

Okay, there probably has
never been a pickup line like that
ever, but I had throw in one or
two pop culture references.

Regardless, how many times
have you been shut down by that
potential hookup only to return
to your friends and tell them that
you didn’t even care in the ﬁrst
place? 20? 30? Okay, maybe it’s
just me.

Look, you might not have ever
had these thoughts. You might
completely disagree with every-
thing that I just wrote about.

But that’s the great thing
about this generation. I don’t
even care.

Why did we elect the Nobel prom king as president?

Abel Delgado laments the decision to award President Obama the Nobel Peace Prize after just nine months in office

By Abel Delgado
co LU M N I sr

Someone should go check
Alfred Nobel’s grave and see if
his bones are still rolling from
the news that broke early Friday
morning. Seeing the prestigious
award he founded turn into a po-
liticized stunt honoring people
for what hopefully might happen
would probably upset him quite
a bit.

President Obama only needed
to be president for 10 days before
he was nominated for the once-
impressive Nobel Peace Prize.
He needed just nine months in
the White House to convince the
committee he was worthy of an
award that has honored such ac-
complished individuals as Nel-
son Mandela, Elie Wiesel and
Mother Theresa. So what exactly
did he do to merit his name being
mentioned in the same breath?

 

One would assume most of
the work that qualiﬁed him was
done during the campaign. So

to the other, something entirely
common in American history.
Was it historically signiﬁcant be-

Imagine being declared valedictiorian your

freshman year in the hope that you would

get outstanding grades.

was it for winning the election
and uniting the country? Well, he
certainly won the election but if
he has united anyone lately, it’s
the opposition.

His election was not some
sort of radical revolution or
movement towards democratiza-
tion, either. It was just a peaceful
transfer of power from one party

cause of his racial background?
Of course, but I’m sure he would
refuse an award for simply that.
Furthermore, his campaigns
against Hillary Clinton and John
McCain weren’t exactly “peace-
ful.” His opponents attacked his
lofty rhetoric pretty hard, but he
and his staff were never the type

to hold ﬁre.

A response to porn

Lauren Miller criticizes Stockton Bullitts view that porn
does not degrade women or contribute to sexual assault

I don’t normally feel com-
pelled to respond to articles I
read and I don’t typically write
“letters to the editor.” However,
I found that I could not read
Stockton Bullitt’s recent piece,
entitled “Pomography is not so
evil” without responding to his
views, especially if to remain
silent would indicate a tacit
agreement with his opinions.

Although he brings up some
thought-provoking points for
discussion, I strongly disagree
with the premise of his article
that pomography has no impact
on men’s view of women. Mr.
Bullitt argues, “Pomography
cannot be considered an inher-
ently misogynistic entity.”

Ask almost any woman,
and she will tell you that porn
is completely degrading and
treats women as sex objects.
Just because many men don’t
believe that porn debases wom-
en does not mean that it doesn’t.
It is always easy for people to
believe that a situation is entire-
ly acceptable when they aren’t
on the receiving end of objecti-
ﬁcation and disrespect.

Mr. Bullitt claims, “Men do
not view women differently be-
cause of what they see in porn,
especially when it comes to
rape . . . I have never met any
guy whose view of women has
been altered thanks to what he
has seen late at night online.”

He is right to the extent that
there has not yet been a study
that has conclusively shown a
positive correlation between
pornography and rape. Howev-
er, it is irrational to assume that
just because porn theoretically
does not “cause” rape, it also
has absolutely no impact on the
way men perceive women.

I am wondering how any of
us, male or female, can make
that claim with conﬁdence. How
can you know with certainty
that porn has absolutely no ef-
fect on a guy’s View of women?
The fact is that some men hold
a view of females which tends
towards sexism or which objec-
tiﬁes women.

This view is not inherent, as
it obviously doesn’t exist in ev-
ery guy. The fact that sexism is
far from just a “guy thing” that

can’t be avoided would suggest
that any misogynistic view of
women which men might hold
is learned from cultural inﬂu-
ences.

Some of the most salient of
these inﬂuences are found in
the media which people choose
to consume: television, music,
movies and, of course, pomog-

' stake here is respect more than

anything else. I have yet to meet
any ﬁrst-year female say some-
thing like, “I feel degraded and
objectiﬁed by being assigned to
the top ﬂoor of my dorm.” Yet
I have heard many women say
that they feel degraded by pom
or feel that the very existence of
the porn trade exploits women’s

men perceive women.

raphy. What you watch and lis-
ten to does affect you. It may
not always directly change your
actions (after all, Mr. Bullitt is
right that porn does not neces-
sarily cause rape), but it can and
does have a strong inﬂuence on
your attitudes. And are not atti-
tudes what, in turn, lead to ac-
tions?

Mr. Bullitt asserts that on
our campus “there are much
bigger issues that contribute to
the problem of misogyny than
pornography.” As an example
of one of these issues which he
believes help to create sexism,
he mentions the way that ﬁrst-
year women occupy the upper
two ﬂoors of the dorms, while
ﬁrst-year men get the bottom
ﬂoors.

I ﬁnd myself struggling to
understand what is so “sexist”
about this arrangement. It seems
to me that following that logic,
it would be an equally sexist
proposition to put the women on
the lower ﬂoors and the men on
the top ones, or that perhaps it
is “sexist” to have the ﬁrst-year
men and women attend their re-
quired sexual assault seminars
in single-sex groups.

But yet, according to Mr.
Bullitt, that issue and others
like it contribute far more to
problems of sexism and the rise
of misogyny than pornography
does. -

I believe that the issue at

It is irrational to assume that just because

bodies for men’s sexual arousal
and gratiﬁcation.

Mr. Bullitt concludes by stat-
ing that “blaming bad actions
on abstract inﬂuences is always
easy to do.” I agree with him to
the extent that we should not
blame the porn industry when a
rape occurs, just as we ought not
blame the gun industry when a
school shooting takes place or
blame the dining hall when we
gain the freshman 15.

Yes, people are responsible
for their own actions and choic-
es, regardless of the inﬂuences
from which they might emerge.

Nevertheless, people still
need to be aware of how the me-
dia they consume affects their
attitudes. It is wrong to assume
that a form of media which
most women ﬁnd completely
degrading and obj ectifying does
not predispose men to internal-
ize—and perhaps act on-the
misogyny they might be watch-
ing at 2:00 in the morning in
their dorm rooms.

So what was it? One Nobel
Prize Committee member said
it was because he has “changed
the global mood.” The commit-
tee members also spoke of all the
great initiatives President Obama
has mentioned, but not accom-
plished, or even started for that
matter. When asked why they
didn’t they just wait until one of
those initiatives actually had tan-
gible results, they lamented that
there was no way of knowing for
sure that that day would come,
but stated that the award would
surely help him get there. Imag-
ine being declared Valedictorian
your freshmen year in the hope
that you would get outstanding
grades.

It is now obvious that Europe
is quite happy with Obama. The
Nobel Prize is a distinctly Eu-

ropean—run institution, which is
why they do not care about Chi-
nese dissidents and Iranian free-
dom Twitterers. In all honesty,
Twitter probably had more to
do with spreading freedom and
peace this year than President
Obama did.

Not all Europeans are blind
to this, though. Former Polish
President and Nobel Peace Prize
Winner Lech Walsea summed up
the feelings of the level-headed
Europeans by proclaiming, “So
soon? Too early. He has no con-
tribution so far. He is only begin-
ning to act.”

What’s more, the opinion of
Americans on this is about as
close to being united as I have
seen on any issue as of late. No
Democrat, Obama supporter or
even Obama campaign staffer

has tried to defend this to me.
Ironically, even those who
saw the Obama during the cam-
paign as a false prophet of sorts
have to admit that this is not his
fault. He did not ask for the prize,
and he looks a little embarrassed
by it. Pundits are already yapping
about how this will hurt him.

I think it won’t. I hope some of
what he wants to accomplish on
the global scale actually gets ac-
complished. But this issue shows
that when you turn politics into a
popularity contest, you might get
a prom king for president.

Brealdng the silence

Students have power to speak up and change trend of abuse

On October 1, Catharine
MacKinnon, a renowned legal
scholar and women’s rights ad-
vocate, spoke to a full crowd in
Lee Chapel.

In her speech discussing the
relationship between gender in-
equality and the sex industry,
MacKinnon spoke out against
the use of sexual violence against
women as a tool for obtaining
power.

As we sat in the crowd listen-
ing to MacKinnon’s thoughtful,
albeit biting, words, we were
struck by the similar dynamic
of gender inequality and sexual
assault that is disturbingly preva-
lent on our campus.

national statistic that one in four
women will be sexually assault-
ed in college, this means that at
W&L, fully half of your female
classmates will be sexually as-
saulted in their four years here.

More than horrifying, this
number is unacceptable. T00 of-
ten, the half (or more) of us are
silent, convinced that our situ-
ation is rare, invalid, or worse,
hopeless.

Like the women MacKinnon
discussed, those exploited by
the media and the pornography
industry, women on campus are
submitting to a cycle of abuse
and silence.

Our silence enables sexual as-

Our silence enables sexual assault to re-

main hidden from the portrait of integrity

and honor that is advertised as the deﬁning

quality of W&L.

According to W&L’s data
from the 2008 National College
Health Assessment, female stu-
dents on this campus are twice as
likely to have experienced sexual
assault as compared to the aver-
age college woman. Given the

sault to remain hidden from the
portrait of integrity and honor
that is advertised as the deﬁning
quality of W&L. Until this ugly
truth is seriously addressed, the
values of our community will
continue to be compromised.

MacKinnon closed with a
fable about a Native American
sage speaking with two men.
Trying to prove her powerless,
they brought a bird in their hands
and asked her, “Is this bird alive
or dead?” If she said it was alive,
they planned to crush it; if she
told them it was dead, they would
set it free. Aﬂer a few minutes,
the sage ﬁnally spoke up. She
said, “I do not know if it is dead
or alive. It is in your hands.”

Like the sage in this story,
women at W&L constantly face
this catch-22: we cannot pro-
tect ourselves by being silent,
but if we speak out, we may be
crushed.

Fortunately for us, we can
speak out, we can change. Sex-
ual assault does not have to be a
crippling force in this commu-
nity. The choice is up to us. It is
in our hands.

moe. jams for Homecoming

Band draws crowd and shows talent at this year is concert, even if solos feel a little too long

This year’s Homecoming concert
featured moe., a jam band formed in
the 19905. The concert, put on by the
General Actlvities Board, was held in
the Pavlllon on Wednesday.

By Wlll Mays
STAFF WRITER

The lights dimmed and the air was hazy with a light fog of
smoke as moe. took the stage last Wednesday for Washington
and Lee’s Homecoming concert. Though the band only played 12
songs including the encore, band members played their speciﬁc
blend of jam rock for nearly two and a half hours.

A crowd that initially seemed mostly populated by students
gave way by the end of the night to a wave of local residents, and a
few who would have been more at home in the tents of Bonnaroo.
At times, the antics of some of these tie—dye-clad outsiders were
arguably more exciting than what was going on onstage. .

To say that the gentlemen of moe. are talented would be an
understatement, and there were times the band would jam for 20
minutes or more on the same motif. To some, these self-indulgent
grooves were the best part of the show, but many others found the
jamming to be boring. The band played really well, but, as one tired
student put it, “I remember when concerts had words.”

When moe. wasn’t churning out ﬁery solos for seemingly
half—hours at a time, they were unanimously excellent. The whole
crowd, student and local alike, cheered along when the band
broke into a cover of Pink Floyd’s, “Time,” and concert-goers
remaining at the end of the show swayed and sang with the hit
“Okayalright.”

Overall, the band seemed to be well-received, even if some
students didn’t quite understand the concept of a jam band. They
also managed to draw one of the more eclectic crowds W&L’s
pavilion is likely to receive. Those attending walked away happy
for the most part, and the band put on a show worth attending.

1. Close games trip up Generals

The men is soccer team dropped two games over the week, losing to Virginia Wesleyan, I-0, and Roanoke, I-0.

STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s men’s soc-
cer fell to Roanoke, 1-0, on Saturday
leaving the Generals with a record of 3
- 4 - 3. Neither team scored in the ﬁrst
half, but the Maroons added a point
to the board in the 69th minute with a

goal from their junior defender Michael
Stark.

The Generals fought a close game,
but were unable to get their shots on
goal before the clock ran out. Junior
goalie and Captain Ben Bartlett had

three impressive saves throughout the
match.

Roanoke is ranked second in the
ODAC with a record of 6 - 3 - 1 and
its victory over the Generals marks
its fourth win in a row. Seated behind
Lynchburg, the defending ODAC
champions displayed great defensive
play. As a result, Roanoke ﬁrst-year
goalie Ryan Russell only needed one
save to shut out the Generals.

The 1-0 score makes the game
seem like a clear win for Roanoke, but
questions of clean play and fair offi-
ciating abounded in Saturday’s game.
Call after call was met with hysterical,
frustrated responses from the crowd
and players alike in the second half.

The Generals’ defeat was their sec-
ond of the week after falling to Virgin-
ia Wesleyan 1-0 last Wednesday.

“It was incredibly frustrating to lose
1 — 0 for the second time in a row,” said
sophomore forward Huntley Johnson.
“But it’s great to know we can play
with anybody in the ODAC and have a
chance to win the tournament”.

Senior captain Drew Crowley add-
ed that he was proud to see how much
heart his teammates showed on the
ﬁeld.

The Generals’ regular season record
thus far doesn’t give fair credit to the
ability of this team. Stand-outs like
junior forward James Pymm and ﬁrst-
year forward Dave Phillips have given
the Generals a strong offensive pres-
ence on the ﬁeld.

The optimism of the captains and
younger players alike is justiﬁed in
strong leadership, talent, and athleti-
cism. Their consistent and even play

STEELE BURROW / Staff Photographer

against tough teams in the ODAC like
Roanoke suggests that the Generals
could do very well when tournament
play starts up in the coming weeks.
Nothing is set in stone; a tournament
championship is still a possibility.

The Generals will look to improve
their tournament chances when they
face off against ODAC foe Emory &
Henry in a road game this Wednes-
day.

Generals take a tie over Lynchburg to stay on top of conference
W&L women 3 soccer tied Lynchburg 0-0 in double overtime on Saturday for a 9-1-1 overall record, 7-0-1 in ODAC

By Adam cancryn
STAFF WRITER

Facing perhaps its toughest test of
the season, the Washington and Lee
women’s soccer team battled ODAC ri-
val Lynchburg College to a 0-0 double-
overtime tie on Saturday. 3

The draw gave the Generals (9-1-1,
7-0-1 in the ODAC) a conference-lead-
ing 23 points and kept them on track to
capture the No. 1 seed.

A steady rain greeted the teams at
kickoff, creating slick conditions that
hampered both offenses. Simple touches
and throw-ins became challenging on
the wet ﬁeld, making it difﬁcult for both
Lynchburg and W&L to generate much
possession play. With long offensive
runs proving futile, the match quickly
turned into a mid-ﬁeld battle, marked by
solid defense on each side.

“The rain deﬁnitely makes it more

difficult,” said sophomore keeper Emily
Leary. “I’m not a fan of playing in the
rain, but you do what you have to do.
Both teams are playing with it.”

Still scoreless going into the second
half, Lynchburg put early pressure on
the Generals’ back line. But they could
not ﬁnd the net as each scoring opportu-
nity was tumed away.

Though the second half provided
more end—to-end action, the Generals
could not capitalize on their chances
either. With starting sophomore striker
Kat Barnes injured, sophomore forward
Allie Espina moved to the top of the for-
mation, where she manufactured W&L’s
best scoring chance of the day. Follow-
ing a Lynchburg turnover in its own
end, ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Katie Howard
found Espina in the middle of the ﬁeld.

She slipped by the last defender but put
the one-on-one shot just over the cross-
bar.

The match served as yet another
showcase of W&L’s dominant defense,
as its opponent was blanked for the
ninth time in 11 games. Leary recorded
four saves, two of them coming in the
ﬁnal minutes of overtime. The Generals
have now given up just one goal in con-
ference play.

“I have so much conﬁdence in the
defense,” Leary said. “It’s been phenom-
enal; they’re the heart of our team.”

The tie was the ﬁrst overtime game
played by W&L since September 2008.

“We play to win the game  but
once you get into that second overtime
period, there’s certain things you do to
play more conservative,” said coach

Neil Cunningham. “[The defense] was
big today and they’ve done exactly what
they’ve been doing all season.”

With only three ODAC matches left,
W&L is in complete control of its desti-
ny. The tie, coupled with their 3-0 defeat
of Eastern Mennonite on Wednesday,
puts the team four points ahead of its
closest competitor, Virginia Wesleyan.
In addition. W&L owns the tiebreaker,
having beaten Virginia Wesleyan 4-1
earlier in the year.

“We come away from this game feel-
ing good,” Leary said. “As much as we
would’ve liked to win, a tie is one that
we’re satisﬁed with now.”

Of W&L’s next three opponents,
only Bridgewater College holds a win-
ning conference record. A ﬁrst-place ﬁn-
ish would give the Generals the top seed

in the ODAC tournament.

The key to success will be the asser-
tive play of the W&L defense, a unit that
has become the backbone of the team.
With Barnes lost to injury, the Generals
expect to play more defensively-minded
until its offense can regroup. Espina,
who scored the ﬁrst goal against Eastern
Mennonite and leads the team with sev-
en, along with ﬁrst-years Ainsley Daigle
and Katie Howard, will be expected to
pick up the slack on the scoring end.

“It changes things a lot because
[Barnes] is such a good player and such
an inﬂuential player on our team,” Cun-
ningham said. “So we’ve had to adjust,
and I’m just pleased by the way the kids
responded.”

W&L volleyball kicks off a five-game winning streak  

The Generals claimed a home victory over Lynchburg and went 4-0 in the Averett Invitational to get to .500 mark

Washington and Lee volleyball team
is on a roll. The Generals led a ﬁve-

on Wednesday and four straight victo-

W&L defeated Lynchburg 3-2 on
Wednesday in the “Dig Pink” match
that raised awareness and funds for

Raising money for such a good cause
was motivation in its own right, but the
Generals were also looking to make a
statement out on the court.

“I’m interested in a win,” said junior
middle blocker Louise Brooks.

The Generals stepped up to hand
Lynchburg its ﬁrst league loss of the
season.

In the ﬁrst game, Lynchburg came
out ﬁring to take the game 21-25. The
Generals then battled and took the next

two sets, 25-21 and 27-25. But a 23-25
loss in the fourth game sent the match to
a ﬁnal deciding ﬁfth game.

W&L battled to win the ﬁfth game
15-10 to take the victory. With the win,
W&L improved to 6-10 on the season

“This was an awesome match,” said
Dee. “We were able to ﬁght through be-
ing down and work our way out of some

tough spots. Going to ﬁve games and I

getting a win is great. Defeating an un-
defeated ODAC team at home on a night
like Dig Pink is just really special.”

Homecoming victory

The Generals improved to 2-4 with a 28-14 win over Catholic on Saturday

Washington and Lee rebounded from
a tough loss at Randolph-Macon with a
decisive homecoming victory over the
Catholic Cardinals, 28-14.

The running game carried the Generals
through the game, picking up several key
first downs in the fourth quarter to protect
the lead and keep the clock running. The
Generals totaled for 316 yards rushing,
also adding all four touchdowns on the
ground.

Sophomore running back Jonathan
Clemo gained 137 yards and a touchdown
on twenty-three carries, and sophomore
running back Harrison Hudson added 76
yards and a touchdown on ﬁve carries.

Although the combined running attack
of Clemo and Hudson seemed to be the
focus of the offense on Saturday, sopho-
more quarterback Charlie Westfal added
a strong performance on the ground, run-
ning for 63 yards and a touchdown in ad-
dition to going 5-9 on passing for the day.

The game started with an early Catho-
lic touchdown on a 36-yard run from run-

 

ning back Rick Barry. However, Washing-
ton and Lee responded quickly, putting
up three touchdowns in a row to bring the
lead to 21-7 early in the second half.

The Generals were able to overcome
a late-game push by the Cardinals, who
brought the game to 21-14 with a 1-yard
quarterback sneak with 6:24 left in the
third quarter.

Perhaps the most important play of the
game came in the fourth quarter with just
6:47 remaining, as ﬁrst-year running back
Brett Murray scored on a perfectly timed
option from Westfal from 35 yards out on
fourth and three.

The play capped a decisive drive for
the Generals that kept Catholic from ral-
lying in the fourth quarter.

Defensively, the Generals were led by
sophomore linebacker Rob Look with 12
total tackles and senior Gus Cavanaugh
with 10.

“It was our ﬁrst really well-rounded
game,” Westfal said. “It was a complete
game, with the offense putting up points
and the defense coming up with big plays
throughout the game. Special teams were

also a huge factor, as we were able to limit
mistakes and never really let Catholic
back come back.”

The Generals responded well to the
homecoming crowd, sporting their blue
in honor of the ﬁrst “blue-out” in W&L
history. Although there still were plenty
of other colors in the stands; the crowd
was deﬁnitely the largest of the year, with
about 1200 in attendance.

The Generals are looking forward to the
biggest game of the season to date coming
up next weekend at Hampden-Sydney.

“The team is really clicking at this
point, but we have a huge week in front
of us,” Westfal said. “Hampden-Sydney is
always a very good team and it’s going to
be a big conference game for us.”

With plenty of conference matches left
this season, the Generals are looking to
build on this win to reverse their recent
three-game losing streak.

“That was deﬁnitely a huge win for
us,” said sophomore tight end Jake Tun-
ney. “The team looked really good and I
think this will help build some momentum
going into next Saturday.”

A win and a loss for field hockey

The Generals lost to Eastern Mennonite, 6-0, but rallied to defeat
Bridgewater, 5-0, to improve to 5-6 overall, 3-2 in ODAC play

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

Washington and Lee’s ﬁeld hockey
season has been a roller coaster, from a 1-
4 start to the season to a three-game win
streak, and from a heartbreaking loss to
Lynchburg to Sallie Arrnstrong’s career
goals record. And this week was no differ-
ent. The team lost 6-0 to Eastern Menno-
nite University on Wednesday and turned
right around and blanked Bridgewater 5-0
on Saturday.

W&L (5-6, 3-2 ODAC) traveled to
Eastern Mennonite with hopes of upend-
ing the undefeated conference leaders.

Unfortunately, the Royals came out ﬂy-
ing and dashed any possible thoughts of
an upset, scoring ﬁve goals in the ﬁrst
half alone.

A bright spot in the game was ﬁrst-
year goalkeeper Kirsten Kyne who came
in with 15 minutes left in the ﬁrst period
and stopped 9 shots the rest of the way.
However, the Generals were unable to get
any offense started as the Royals posted a
dominant 31-14 shot advantage.

“We just did not have the right mind-
set,” ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Chelsea Ste-

venson said of the loss. ‘‘It was a deﬁnite
wake-up call”.

And wake up they did. The Generals re-
turned home and blasted Bridgewater 5-0
on Saturday. The team many had plenty of
motivation for their homecoming game.

“We were playing for something other
than ourselves on Saturday”, Stevenson
said. “ It was a game for breast cancer, we
were looking to get back on track, and it
was homecoming. We were ready to go”.

With all these factors in W&L’s favor,
the Generals lit up the scoreboard on an
otherwise overcast day. Senior midﬁelder
Grace McGee started the barrage with a
goal off of a penalty stroke just six min-
utes into the game.

Three minutes later, senior forward
Armstrong hammered home goal num-
ber two with an assist from sophomore
forward Christina Benedetti. The team
locked it down on defense and headed into
halftime still up 2-0.

The story did not change in the second
period. The Generals kept the pedal to the
metal and put away the Eagles with three

more goals before time expired.

F irst-year Ashley Barnes scored unas-
sisted, senior forward Steph Mansey net-
ted a goal with an assist from ﬁrst-year
forward Katharine Price, and Sallie Ann-
strong capped off the day with a goal off
an assist from Mansey.

Kyne and senior goalkeeper Caro-
line Habliston both saw time in goal and
helped post the season’s ﬁrst shutout.

If the team did not have the right mind-
set versus EMU, they deﬁnitely did versus
Bridgewater. They were focused and mo-
tivated, and with the skill they have, that
is a lethal combination for any opponent
to face.

"The Generals have ﬁve more regular
season games before the ODAC playoffs
start on Halloween.

“We are most deﬁnitely looking to get
our revenge in the tournament,” Stevenson
said.

The Generals’ next game is against
Roanoke at home on Tuesday.
