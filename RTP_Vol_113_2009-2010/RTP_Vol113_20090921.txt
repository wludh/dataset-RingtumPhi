Interpreting

Constitution day speaker
Louis Fisher argues
against judicial supremacy

By Jessica Strait
STAFF WRITER

Two hundred and twenty-two years ago, a
document was adopted by the Constitutional Con-
vention, and from that moment on it became the
supreme law of the United States. To celebrate
and mark Constitution Day, Washington and Lee
invited Louis Fisher, an author, scholar, researcher
and government consultant, to speak in Stack-
house Theater about Judicial Supremacy, the idea
that the Supreme Court has more power than other
branches to interpret the Constitution.

Fisher said the Founders regarded the Supreme
Court as the least threatening branch of govern-
ment, and he used historical examples to argue
that judicial supremacy was never intended, has
never existed and never should exist. His speech
was especially relevant after a summer of media
attention focused on the nomination of Sonia So-
tomayor, now a Supreme Court justice.

Fisher said the Constitution is for all of us to
interpret, pointing out that most of our rights and
liberties come from us and the values we hold
dear, not from court rulings. The most direct
communication through citizens and government
is through jury decisions.

' When the Supreme Court rules on a case, the
public is involved in constitutional law through
their reactions to these decisions. In the past,
the Court has changed rulings when the public
overwhelmingly disagrees. In 1940 the Supreme
Court ruled upheld a compulsory ﬂag salute for
students in school. In 1942 they declared the case
“wrongly decided,” and credit for the overturned
decision went to the whole country, more speciﬁ-
cally the people who did not accept it and voiced
their disgust.

Fisher stressed that even if the Supreme Court
votes unanimously on a case, policy does not
change until a law or statute is passed. In 1954, the
Supreme Court struck down the idea of .“separate
but equal” in Brown v. The Board of Education.
However, until Congress passed the Civil Rights
Act in 1964, almost zero social changes came out
ofthe 1954 ruling.

And often, if Congress does not agree, it will
pass a law to make its point, proving that the Su-
preme Court has far from the ﬁnal say. When the
Supreme Court upheld a decision in 1986 deny-
ing a Jewish Air Force ofﬁcer the right to wear a
yarmulke while he testiﬁed, the court justiﬁed it
by claiming that the military needs uniformity. A
year later, Congress, which obviously disagreed,
passed a law that allowed the wearing of religious
gear as long as it does not interfere with duty.

Fisher also said the Supreme Court is frilly
aware that it makes mistakes. He said that “the
Court in its better moments has recognized it’s
a joint enterprise,” reinforcing that the purpose
the country’s three branch governmental sys-
tem, including two branches within Congress,
is a precaution to keep other branches in check.
Chief Justice Earl Warren once reﬂected that just
because the Court ruled that something was con-
stitutional did not necessarily answer the question
of whether it is. ..

So then, why and how did Judicial Suprema-
cy become such a popular misconceived notion?
Citizens often overlook what comes after a Su-
preme court ruling. Fisher also blames journalists
for reinforcing the all-powerful stereotype of the
Supreme Court by polling citizens about which
branch has the most power, all while hoping for
“the Supreme Court” as the largest percentage an-
swer simply because it seems to make more waves
in the news.

Fisher emphasized that the court can let their
opinions be known, but it is citizens who, in the
end, make the ﬁnal decisions that form the values
and shape the laws of our country.

Starting with Orientation Week, .

Washington and Lee students are con-
stantly reminded of the prevalence of
sexual assault on our campus. This
fall W&L students had the chance to
enroll in a course that attempts to do
something about it.

Senior Emily Coyle said that she

ized that no action had been taken de-
spite the discussion in the class. She
consulted with>Bell who developed
a curriculum that Coyle describes as
“the most perfect manifestation of
what I had been imagining when I
brought the idea to her.”

The new course, taught by Bell

“1 hope to raise awareness of sexual misconduct

empowering students to do something-about them. 1

would like students dirst to feel that they can reduce

the prevalence of sexual misconduct. ”

EMILY COYLE, senlor

got the idea for a class focusing on
sexual assault at W&L after her ex-
perience in Professor Melina Bell’s
Philosophy of Sexual Assault class.
According to Coyle, for the students’
ﬁnal project, they had to write a sexu-
al misconduct policy for W&L. Sev-
eral students from the class presented
their ﬁndings at the Science, Society
and the Arts conference last winter.
At the end of the tenn, Coyle real-

Sowing the seeds of justice  

this tenn, is the Sexual Assault Pre-
vention Workshop, offered through
the Women’s and Gender Studies De-
partment.

In the workshop the 11 students
discuss topics ranging from the party
scene at W&L, to the sexual assault
laws in the state of Virginia, to the at-
titudes that members of each sex have
about the other. Students approach the
subject from all disciplines, including

philosophy, law, psychology, sociol-
ogy and public health.

Their homework does not consist
of traditional papers and exams, but
instead projects to gather information
and raise consciousness about sexual
assault at W&L; According to Bell,
at the end of the term, students “will
come up with a proposal for how to

. implement the solutions they come

up with, and present these solutions
in an open W&L forum to receive
feedback from the community, and
hopefully to recruit as many students
as possible to help implement the so-
lutions.”

Coyle said she hopes to change
students’ attitudes regarding sexual
conduct and make them aware of
what they can do to prevent it.

“I hope to raise awareness of sex-
ual misconduct issues on our campus
primarily in the domain of empower-
ing students to do something about
them. I would like students ﬁrst to feel
that they can reduce the prevalence of
sexual misconduct,” she said.

“I think belief that we are capable
of effecting that change ourselves is
an important ﬁrst step in reducing
sexual violence. I would also like to
see the second step that follows from
that belief—students acting to reduce

sexual misconduct.”

Bell echoed Emily’s sentiments
and said that" she ﬁnds a problem with
the campus’s current tolerance of as-
sault.

“Our speaker from Project Ho-
rizon, Judy Casteele, expressed her
view that W&L students are some-
times afraid to report being sexually
assaulted because they believe it will
be social suicide. She asked why it
is not social suicide to commit sexual
assault,” Bell said.

For students interested in support-
ing this new effort, Bell has recom-
mended a few upcoming events. On
Sept. 23, members of the Lexington
police department and the Rockbridge
County sheriff’s ofﬁce will speak on
police handling of reported sexual as-
sault cases. Their talk will take place
in Wilson 2018 at 2:30 p.m.

On Oct. 7 at 2:30 p.m. in Stack-
house Theater, students can get a male
perspective on male-female relations
with Michael S. Kimmel’s “Mars, Ve-
nus, or Planet Earth?” This presenta-
tion will be an entertaining one-hour
lecture on DVD about gender rela-

tions, masculinity and femininity.

W&L Law and Grimes Law embark on second year in Liberia Human Rights Practicuum

By Katherine Roberts
COPY EDITOR

The Washington and Lee Uni-
versity School of Law is starting its
second year in the Liberia Human
Rights Practicuum with a joint class
held with students in Liberia.

The practicuum is a partnership
with the Louis A. Grimes School of
Law at the University of Liberia in
Monrovia to work on increasing jus-
tice in Liberia.

The program, which also works
with the United Nations Ofﬁce on
Drugs and Crime and the American
Bar Association in Monrovia, fea-
tures a joint class of W&L and Libe-
rian law_students. W&L Law Profes-

p sor Speedy Rice teaches the class by

videoconference-—the Liberian law
students meet at the US. Embassy in
Monrovia, according to Ryan Decker,
who coordinates the class from Libe-
ria. If heavy rains cause problems
with the video feed, Decker teaches
the class.

“Class time can serve unique and
different purposes for the W&L and
Liberian students,” Decker said.

While the course teaches W&L
students about a completely different
legal system, it exposes Liberian stu-
dents to “material not covered under
their normal legal curriculum, and...
a practical way of developing solu-
tions to the issues preventing access
to justice in Liberia,” he said.

The class learns about human
rights on international and regional
levels before focusing on Liberia,
according to Juliette Syn, who ﬁlled
Decker’s role last year. In November,
W&L students will visit Monrovia for
two weeks and interview prisoners to
learn about civil rights in court.

Over 85 percent of the prisoners
who students from this program inter-
viewed last year were still in pretrial,
according to Syn. She attributed this
to the civil war that ran from 1989 to
2003, and the subsequent loss of in-
frastructure necessary for the justice
system. “Although you might have
a judge, you may not have a support
staff,” she said. Prisons keep track of

. prisoners’ arrivals and departures with

a white board, according to Syn.
Record-keeping is “one of the big-
gest obstacles facing the Magistrate
Sitting Program, although seemingly
simple to the American observer,”
Decker said. Last year, students gath-
ered information on prisoners and
their reasons for arrest, and put it in

mg court ﬁles and helping to develop
better record-keeping methods, in
addition to traveling to prisons. The
program “has the potential to make
a large impact,” Decker said. “The
Practicum gets stronger with each
semester as we develop stronger con-
nections in Liberia that, in turn, open

“The program has the potential to make a large im-

pact. The Pracitcum gets stronger with each semes-

ter as we develop stronger connections in Liberia

that open up new opportunites to further develop. ”

RYAN DECKER, Liberian law class coordinator

a format useful for the Ministry of
Justice.

This year, to work to reduce
prison overcrowding, students will
work with the newly created Magis-
trate Sitting Program, acting as judi-
cial clerks for the six magistrates in
Monrovia. Students will be organiz-

up new opportunities to further de-

‘ velop the"program.”

W&L Law also has programs in
Cambodia, Iraq and The Hague, ac-
cording to the law school web site.

Joe Wilson’s ungentlemanly attack on President Obama

South Carolina Congressman and W&L Alumnus Joe Wilson s ‘controversial outburst is analyzed by Dane Davis

By Dane Davls
surr warren

In the middle of what was
supposed to be the re-launch
of President Barack Obama’s
health insurance reform agenda,
a Congressman yelled out two
simple words that managed to
change the national discourse for
the next few weeks.

While stating that his health-
care plan does not cover undocu-
mented workers, Pres. Obama,
along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi
and Vice President Joe Biden
seated behind him, was clearly
shocked to hear and see Repre-
sentative Joe Wilson of South
Carolina point and yell, “You
Lie.”

This breach of decorum set off
a ﬂurry of sound and fury from
the pundit class. David Brooks
of the New York Times lamented
the “expressive individualism”
and “self-exposure” of today’s
“High Five Nation.”

Some, such as former Presi-
dent Jimmy Carter, took the out-
burst as an indicator of a deep
seated racial ‘resentment ﬁnally
bursting over because of a black
president. Others took to Rep.
Wilson’s defense, stating that the
insurance reform did in fact in-

clude illegals. Furthermore, they
argued, Britain’s parliament has
rancorous debate that anyone
who has access to C-SPAN can
witness.

The issue of whether or not
Obama actually lied is not that
important. Congress has since

barred non-residents from en-

the kerfuﬂle. .

Instead, there are two deeper
issues surrounding the current
debate over Joe Wilson’s jejune
behavior. The ﬁrst is a broader
conversation over the appropri-
ate level of deference one ought
to owe the opposing party, its
leaders, and ideology in a loud
and often cacophonous republic.

uals believe said viewpoints are
erroneous.

In a pluralistic democracy,
the clash of ideas is an essential
and necessary part of discerning
the public good. Since no man
has a monopoly on truth, free
discourse is required in order
that public reason may discern
what is proper and true, a point
eloquently made by John Stuart
Mill.

This idealistic belief must
be accompanied by certain be-

haviors that are shared by the
populace so that it may become
a reality. One such behavior is
toleration. Shouting, ﬁlibuster-
ing, and deceitful debate tactics
do nothing to advance the public
good. I

Viewing one’s intellectual
opponent not as someone with
whom you disagree but as some-
one who is malicious, evil, or
possessing maligned intentions
leads to a personal defensiveness
that incompatible with a true be-
lief in reason and an honest at-
tempt at the truth.

This quality is unfortunately
possessed by members of both
sides of our political spectrum.
Observe the cries of “Fascism!”
by made certain liberals during
the Bush years and repeated by
some of today’s conservatives.

That said, this trait is not new.
It is an ongoing tension that oc-
curs within the body politic and
even within individuals; a clash
between civility and the zeal of
which only ideological assured-
ness can produce.

Since it is present in all gov-
ernmental systems that allow
their citizens and politicians

to speak freely, it is not unique
to America or today’s society.
Television, the intemet, and
other forms of mass media may
exacerbate particular instances
of poor behavior, leading to the
overall impression of a decaying
society.

The United States has a long
tradition of libelous statements
made against presidents and
politicians, oftentimes made by
those within Congress.

We are fortunate that our cur-
rent disagreements are expressed
only in words. Congressional
history has many examples of
past ﬁghts on the ﬂoor of the
House and Senate. Pundits, and
those reading them, must be
careful not idealize the forgotten
past as a barometer or standard
for whatever is apparently lack-
ing in contemporary times.

While “You Lie!” is certainly
coarse and boorish, it does not
compare to more despicable
statements made by members of
Congress throughout the institu-
tion’s past.

How is all of this relevant to
the Washington and Lee commu-
nity? As a alumnus of W&L, J_oe

Omicron Delta Kappa

Omicron D elta Kappa was founded December 3, l9l4 at W&L
by 15 student and faculty leaders. The founders formulated the
idea that leadership of exceptional quality and versatility in
college should be recognized, that representatives'in all phases
of coll ege life should cooperate in worthwhile endeavors, and
that outstanding students, faculty, and administrators should
meet on a basis of mutual interest, understanding and helpful-
ness. ODK was the first college honor society ofa national
scope to give recognition and honor for meritorious leadership
and service in extracurricular activities and to encourage devel-
opment of general campus citizenship.

Trying to survive the student election cam“pains”

Law student Jordan Rothman takes a long, hard look at the current state of student elections

By Jordan Rothman
STAFF WRITER

I absolutely hate election sea-
son.

No, I am not talking about
the national political landscape,
full of sound bytes, amorphous
phrases, and the like.

No, I am not even talking
about the state-wide campaigns,
which seem to be ﬂooding lawn
signs and television sets every-
where.

Actually, I am referring to the
electioneering that is happen-
ing right now on campus, and in
many regards this campaigning
is more repugnant than anything
that can be cooked up by profes-
sional politicians.

Over at the law school, and
soon on the undergraduate side,
people have been putting on
their phony faces, manufacturing
somewhat humorous signs, and
going from person to person like
traveling salesmen all trying to
garner people’s votes.

The walls have become laden
with ﬁyers, the gossip is all about
the candidates, and I can’t help
but wonder why the hell it all
matters in the ﬁrst place.

The whole process has trans-
formed candidates into beggars,
as I see little difference between
Dickens’ Oliver Twist and the
roaming candidate requesting

Furthermore, the phrases I

years.

What I must ask these candi-
dates is if it is really worth it. Is
the prize of a simple title enough
to counteract the guilt you should
be feeling from selling yourself
out?

I hope the point I am trying to
make is crystal clear.

As we can see in our own
little community, one of the prin-
ciple casualties of the democratic
process is the dignity of every
candidate who runs for office.

levels of government to the low-

ls Facebook real?

Wondering if people is F acebook proﬁles are really
an indicator of how they are as people

By Gozl Egbuonu
STAFF WRITER

As I sat in the Commons thinking about top-
ics to discuss in this article, I couldn’t help look-
ing back and forth between Microsoft Word and
my Facebook proﬁle.

I found myself just sitting and watching the
homepage as the status updates refreshed or as
I got notiﬁcations of interesting things like new
quizzes to waste my time taking, new photo
albums in which I am tagged, or the union or
break-up of the infamous and all too popular
Facebook couples.

At that moment, I knew what I had to discuss
with you, my fellow Generals: the question of
whether or not F acebook is real.

In my opinion, I have found that most peo-
ple use Facebook more as a means to create a
more exciting or interesting version of their real
lives.

I bet you’re wondering how I came to this
conclusion. Well, it is rather simple and I will
attempt to explain my observation in two simple
parts: 1. The Photos and 2. The Wall Posts.

Our Facebook photos are the clearest way
to really relay our so-called “real” lives to our
friends and family. Thus, I thought it would be
the best choice to begin with an explanation of

doing something. I have once, in a serious bout
with boredom, looked through a Facebook pro-
ﬁle purely created to make the individual’s life
seem much more exciting that it actually was,
only to ﬁnd an album in which all of the pictures
were of people posing.

And speaking of friends, the friendly Face-
book wall posts are another way in which peo-
ple try to create an image of themselves that
drastically differs from their actual lives. Now,
I will admit that I blow up people’s wall posts,
but for the most part, those people are actually
my really good friends.

Nothing makes me scratch my head more
than when I get a newsfeed of someone writing
on another person’s wall when I know for a fact
that (a) they are not really friends and (b) they
probably do not even like each other.

I mean why else would one waste time
writing on another person’s wall, whom they
clearly do not like, unless it was to create an
image for outsiders that says, “Hey, look! I have
friends?”

I hate to sound like I am bashing Facebook
users, because I am not. I have committed of-
fenses on F acebook that would greatly displease

What I don ’t get about people who manufacture F acebook

lives is how they are able to ﬁnd that much time while they are

socializing to be taking so many pictures. Do you stop in the

middle of yourshenanigans and request that people take pic-

tures ?

how some people manufacture a “cooler” life
via Facebook.

For example, one’s F acebook proﬁle picture
is often a picture that either shows others that
you are attractive, have friends or are the quint-
essential emo, prepster, hipster, athlete, thug,
or all around fool. People go to great lengths to
ensure that the proﬁle picture they choose falls
into one of those categories.

You don’t even have to question my point
here. Just look at the proﬁle picture of any of
your friends. Does it fall into one of those cat-
egories?

What I don’t get about the people who man-
ufacture F acebook lives is how they are able to
ﬁnd that much time while they are socializing
to be taking so many pictures. Do you stop in
the middle of your shenanigans and request that
people take pictures? The clear difference be-
tween manufactured social lives presented in
picture form and real ones are what the people
in the images are doing.

Yes, there are times at a social function where
you will stop and pose with your friends, but
when you are truly socializing, those pictures
will often have people in action——that means

my forefathers, but I just can’t deal with how
people are now using what used to be a site
that was solely expected to be used to unite old
friends in college and across the globe, but is in-
stead being used by some people as a means for
turning themselves into someone they clearly
are not.

Despite the aforementioned points, is creat-
ing an inﬂated or completely false social life re-
ally be all that terrible?

We live in a world that puts a great deal of
emphasis on the way you look, your personal-
ity, and the friends you keep, and if you do not
have high marks in all three areas, does it hurt to
make it look like you do?

I guess this is the question F acebook,
MySpace and Twitter is forcing our generation
to ask ourselves, and I think the answer is not
going to be as simple as we would all like it
to be. i

Rockbridge County area.

The organization, which began
in 1982, provides a 24-hour hot-
line, housing, counseling and sup-
port for women and children.

Each year about 170 victims
take advantage of Project Hori-
zon’s services. Twelve full-time
staff members plus volunteers help
maintain a functional" and success-

’ ful organization. Many Washing-
ton and Lee students have partici-
pated since the group’s founding.

Training starts on Saturday and
will last until Oct. 3. Volunteers
must complete the 32 hours of
training in order to begin work.

_ The training sessions consist
of several workshops focusing on
domestic violence, sexual assault
and crisis intervention. Staff mem-
bers will talk about their roles, the
people that they serve and the ef-
fects the organization has on the

-community.

A session on domestic violence
and sexual assault in the gay popu-
lation, as well as a forum with the
Rockbridge County Sherrif’s De-
partment and the Lexington Po-
lice, is included.

While the training seems rigor-
ous, Project Horizon’s Volunteer
Coordinator Rebecca Hamilton
believes it’s important all volun-
teers understand how to react to
potential scenarios.

She thinks that once volunteers
begin working they understand
that the training was worthwhile.

“Volunteers need to know how
to respond to every possible situ-
ation and how to give the best in-
formation and advice to callers,”
Hamilton said.

She said that volunteers mostly
answer the hotline in the evening
hours, provide childcare to the
children of victims at the shel-
ter and help organize community
events. Volunteers are also re-
quired to maintain conﬁdentiality
of the safe shelter location and the
names and information of the vic-
tims. 0

Volunteers are asked to work
for at least six hours per month,

town’s newest addition, is a well-
ness club that promotes a healthy,
nutritious lifestyle.

but Hamilton said that most work
much more than the minimum re-
quirement.

Like most volunteers, junior
Kara Karcher primarily answers
the hotline at night and provides
crisis intervention for victims,
informs them about Project Hori-
zon’s services and also lends call-
ers an empathetic ear.

Karcher, who has volunteered
since the fall of 2008, believes
that she has become much more
educated about the serious issues
of domestic violence and sexual
assault. _ .

‘‘I feel fortunate that I have
been able to touch the lives of a
few women, whether it’s talking
to them on the phone during a ho-
tline call or visiting with residents
in the shelter,” said Karcher.

She encourages others to vol-
unteer and has been struck by how
many volunteers, many female,
give their time and energy to help
ensure the safety of other women
in the community.

And while Karcher said that it
has been emotionally challenging
to maintain appropriate boundar-
ies with victims while they di-
vulge such personal information,

she believes that it is completely _

worthwhile.

“Some of the stories will 1* ‘ak
your heart,” she said, “but it has
been eye-opening, challenging,
and so rewarding to have the op-
portunity to reach out to women in
our community.”

The shop opened its doors
Sept. 8, offering free wellness
evaluations

STEPHANIE HARDIMAN / Arts & Life Editor

to the wellness club, as well as
smoothies with complimentary
and membership herbal tea and herbal aloe.

Lexington Nutri-
tion is not a restau-
rant, although the
meal alternative
smoothies have
drawn in custom-
ers.

Owner and
Lexington resident
Richard
works in the shop
with his daughter,
making smoothies
and small talk, and
educating custom-
ers on the personal
wellness system,
Herbalife, that he
sells. Patrons may
also request free
wellness evalua-
tions and receive a
consultation specif-
ic to their body type
and lifestyle.

The store is
foremost a well-
ness club and dis-
tributor of Herbal-
ife products, said
Beagan. He started
the business out of
his home, provid-
ing tips on healthy

habits and samples

Beagan ’

of Herbalife products. Now the
shop allows him to continue his
distributorship on alarger scale.

Made with Herbalife nutri-
tional shake mixes, the smoothies
contain soy proteins, vitamins,
and ﬁber to balance the metabo-
lism. Customers receive a glass
of complimentary herbal tea and
a small cup of herbal aloe to sip
while their smoothies are made.
The lemon or raspberry herbal
tea contains antioxidants and an
energy boost, while the mango-
ﬂavored herbal aloe helps to aid
digestion.

Through the use of its phar-
maceutical-grade products, Los
Angeles-based Herbalife’s web
site reports that 60 million peo-
ple throughout the world have
lost weight. The products target
not only weight management but
sports, cellular and digestive nu-
trition.

Beagan said he looks for-
ward to furthering business and
promoting healthy lifestyles in
the area. He hopes to ﬁnd local
residents interested in’ becom-
ing wellness coaches, who he
would educate on the Herbalife
products and wellness program.
These coaches would then start
their own local ﬁtness programs.

There is also a weight loss
challenge in the works. For a $35
registration fee, 15 to 20 people

can participate in the competi-
tion, where they will learn about
topics such as heart health, ex-
ercise and the importance of
drinking water. The person who
loses the most weight will win
75 percent of the registration fee
money.

Beagan admitted that people
warned him he would face road-
blocks when opening a new busi-
ness in a down economy, but so
far things have gone smoothly,
he said. He has even acquired a
few regular customers.

While the Herbalife prod-
ucts are a bit pricey, the drink
mixes and powders make many
servings. The company’s sta-
tistics speak to the power of the
products, which suggest the in-
vestment is worth it for those
interested in a healthy lifestyle
change.

Even customers just looking
to check out the $5 smoothies
will ﬁnd themselves welcome
and wellness information avail-
able but by no means forced upon
them. The smoothies, made with
vanilla, chocolate, coffee or fruit
ﬂavors, are delicious, and perfect
as post-workout meals.

The friendly, comfortable
atmosphere of Lexington Nutri-
tion promises the presence of the
wellness club to be a positive
one.

 iMen’s tennis shines in ODAC tourney

During fall season opener, Generals take three out of four singles ﬂights in ODAC Singles Championships

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

After a disappointing 5-3 loss to
Hampden-Sydney in the Old Domin-
ion Athletic Conference Championship
match last year snapped Washington and
Lee’s string of 13 consecutive ODAC
titles, the Generals had a lot to prove as
they kicked off the 2009-2010 season.
And they didn’t disappoint.

Playing host to the ODAC Singles
Championship last weekend, the Gener-
als claimed the top place in three of the
four singles ﬂights.

“Last year was kind of a slap in the
face for us,” said sophomore Michael
Freeman, who competed in the No.

2 singles ﬂight for the Generals. “It
was really a wake-up call for us... We
wanted to make a statement to Hamp-
den-Sydney and show them that We’re
a better team this year. We want to show
them that losing to them last year was
just a ﬂuke.” ’

The winners of the three singles titles
never even lost a match and with all-
W&L match-ups in the No. 2, No. 3, and
No.4 ﬂights, the only real competition in

the tournament came from the Generals _ .

themselves.
“I think it speaks to the amount of
depth we have on our team,” said ﬁrst-

year Hayden White who competed in
the No. 1 singles ﬂight for the Generals.
“We’re a fairly young team. To have so
many players in the ﬁnals and the semi-
ﬁnals is just great.”

In the No. 2 singles bracket, Freeman ‘

put up a 4-0 record to swing his way
into ﬁrst place. Freeman defeated fellow
W&L player sophomore Jonathan Gaff-
ney 6-3, 6-2 in the ﬁnals.

“I struggled with my serve a little
bit,” Freeman said. “But I was able to
grind it out and win some big matches.”

In the No. 3 singles ﬂight, junior Will
Hall also went undefeated at 4-0 to claim

the top spot. Hall defeated W&L junior
Tad Hatcher 6-1, 6-1 in the ﬁnals.

In the No. 4 singles ﬂight, sophomore
Brian Roberts defeated junior Morgan
Hopson 6-2, 6-2 to take ﬁrst place. The
championship victory gave Roberts an
undefeated 4-0 record as well.

White was the only W&L player who
didn’t have to battle his teammates in
the ﬁnals: He faced off against Hamp-
den-Sydney’s Will Moss in the champi-
onships of the No. 1 singles ﬂight. Moss,
the 2009 ODAC Player of the Year, de-
feated White 6-3, 6-4. White ﬁnished
the tournament with a 3-1 record.

Volleyball crushes Marlins, falls to

Generals bounce back from Wednesday ODAC loss to go 1-1 in weekend home matches

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee women’s
volleyball team (2-5, 1-1 ODAC) re-
turned to action Saturday at the Warner

Center, defeating Virginia Wesleyan 3-

0, but losing a nail-biter to Gettysburg
3-2. The team has endured a rocky
ﬁrst week, dropping four of its ﬁrst ﬁve
matches and losing a conference match
for the ﬁrst time since 2007. y

“We changed a lot of technical and
tactical stuff this year,” said Head Coach
Brian Snyder of the team’s slow start.
“It’s a lot of new ideas on defense and it
is simply notphabit yet for the girls. lt’s a
tough adjustment.”

The ladies showed the potential of
this year’s team during their ﬁrst match

on Saturday. After seeing their 19-game
conference winning streak snapped on
Wednesday to Randolph-Macon, the
Generals were out for vengeance against
a team to which they have never before
lost. The squad set the tone early against
the Marlins, taking the ﬁrst game 25-
18. Unfortunately for the Marlins, that
would be the closest they would get to
tasting victory as the Generals closed
out the match by winning 25-17, 25-17.

The straight set win over an ODAC
rival proved that the Generals are not
going away this year. Senior leadership
prevailed in this well-played contest
as outside hitters Rachael Phillips and
Kelly Harrison combined for 19 kills,

while Harrison added 12 digs. Senior
setter Megan Steinhardt also ﬁlled up
the stat sheet by tallying 33 assists. lu-
nior middle blocker Louise Brooks had
a nice day of her own, clocking in 10
kills and 5 digs.

After watching Virginia Wesleyan
play Gettysburg, the Generals got ready
to play the second match of their dou-
bleheader. W&L has neverwon against
Gettysburg in school history. Snyder
encouraged the team by telling them
that “none of that matters.” The ladies
rode the momentum of the morning’s
win as far as they could, taking the ﬁrst
game from the Gettysburg Bullets by a
score of 25-19. Gettysburg immediately

responded with a 25-18 win of their
own in the second set. The back-and-
forth affair continued with W&L taking
set number three 25-22, and Gettysburg
answering again with a 25-21 win in set
four. The tiebreaking ﬁfth set saw W&L
come within two points of closing it out
for the win at 13-11, but the Bullets
scored four straight points to end it and
win the set 15-13, and the match 3-2.
Phillips and Brooks continued their
stellar offensive play with 14 and 18
kills respectively, while Phillips also
chipped in 16 digs. Freshman libero
Cameron Hill also recorded 22 digs.
Steinhardt stole the show, however, with
an astounding 51 assists. But while the

“The Hampden-Sydney No. 1 is just
a strong player,” White said. “He’s the
best player in the ODAC. We’re just
trying to improve as much as we can
so hopefully in the spring a Washington
and Lee player will be named the best
player.” I

The Generals will look to continue
their strong play as they head to the Uni-
versity of Mary Washington on October
3 to compete in the ITA Regional Tour-
nament.

Bullets

stats look good, W&L was not able to
close out Gettysburg.

“There were deﬁnitely a lot of good
things today and a lot of improvement
from Wednesday night” against Ran-
dolph-Macon, Snyder said. “However,
our play was very up-and-down and we
shot ourselves in the foot with unforced
errors.”

The team travels to Eastern Men-
nonite on Tuesday for another ODAC
conference match. Its next home game
is October 3 against the University of
Mary Washington.

Miscues doom Generals in overtime loss

Washington and Lee falls to Greensboro 26-20 after overtime fumble; record drops to 1-2

By Lee Tackett
surr wmren

An overtime fumble, two missed ﬁeld
goals (one blocked) and a blocked extra
point kept the Washington and Lee Gen-
erals (1-2) from victory Saturday as they
fell to the Greensboro College Pride in
overtime 26-20. The Generals were ef-
fective at using their option-based rush-
ing attack throughout the game, rush-
ing for 322 yards as a team. But W&L
struggled to account for the athleticism
of Greensboro’s wide receivers, surren-
dering 280 yards through the air.

It took both teams a quarter to get

' into their offensive rhythms, but scor-

ing was non-stop in the second quar-
ter. Sophomore running back Jonathan
Clemo was able to break the ice with an
8-yard touchdown run to put the Gener-
als up 7-0. Greensboro would answer on
the following drive, as quarterback Mike

Caparaso found Brandon Richardson to
tie the game at 7-7.

But W&L wasted no time taking
back the lead. The Generals ran the ball
on eight of nine plays, using four differ-
ent rushers, and capped the drive with
an 18-yard touchdown run by another
sophomore running back Harrison Hud-
son. Despite their success on the ground,
the Generals’ defense struggled to slow
the Greensboro passing attack. Caparaso
found receiver Nathan Scott three times
on the next drive, with the ﬁnal pass be-
ing a 15-yard touchdown.

Greensboro- struggled with special
team miscues, failing to tie the game af-
ter a missed extra point. The Generals

attempted to raise their lead at the end of _

the half, but were unable to convert on
a ﬁeld goal attempt, leaving them ahead

14-13 at halftime.

The Generals elected to keep the ball
on the ground for most of the second
half. But their ﬁrst drive ended in a failed
fourth down conversion and the second
on a blocked ﬁeld goal. The W&L de-
fense shut down the Greensboro attack,
but a W&L ﬁimble allowed Greensboro
to start a drive deep into W&L territory.
A strong defensive effort by linebackers
sophomore Rob Look and senior David
Love shut down the Greensboro drive.

“They had run a similar play before
and 1 was justtrying to run down hill
and ﬁll the gap,” said Look.

The Generals’ offense had a produc-
tive drive to carry them into the fourth
quarter, but another fumble stopped
the drive. After the defense stood tall
for two more drives, stopping another

Greensboro fourth down conversion at- ‘

tempt, the Generals’ offense was ﬁnally
able to break through again. The Gen-
erals ran the ball four times and Clemo
found the end zone for the second time.
A missed extra point put the Generals
ahead at only 20-13.

With 1:30 left to play, Greensboro
drove the length of the ﬁeld and Ca-
paraso connected with Antwan Thorpe
to send the game into overtime with the
score tied at 20-20.

Greensboro continued their momen-
tum into the overtime, taking the lead
at 26-20. A missed extra point put the
Generals back in a position to win the
game, but a fumbled exchange between
sophomore quarterback Charlie Westfal
and ﬁrst-year running back Brett Mur-
ray was recovered by Greensboro to end

the game.

The Generals turned in a great perfor-
mance on the ground, with three rushing
touchdowns and three players rushing
for over 70 yards.

“It was deﬁnitely the most success‘

we’ve had running the ball this year”
said sophomore tackle John Fitzgib-
bons. “However, despite our ability to
move the ball, we couldn’t quite ﬁnish
drives. “

The Generals outgained the Pride by
almost 100 yards, but their three fum-
bles, two inside Greensboro territory,
kept the Generals from putting the game
away. The Generals travel to Averett
next Saturday, September 26, for their
ﬁrst road game of the season.

W&L soccer remains undefeated

Generals dominate Virginia Wesleyan 4-]; improve to 4-0 overall, 2-0 in ODAC

By Adam Cancryn
STAFF warren

Midﬁelder Ainsley Daigle’s three-goal
day propelled W&L’s women’s soccer-

team to a 4-1 win over Virginia Wesleyan
on Saturday.

Starting for the ﬁrst time as a General,
the ﬁrst-year made an immediate impact,
striking twice in the ﬁrst half. She capped
off her sparkling debut in the 68th minute,
scoring from 18 yards out and completing
the hat trick.

It was Daigle’s ﬁrst collegiate hat trick
and gives her four goals on the season.

“Funny enough, this was the ﬁrst game
she started,” head coach Neil Cunningham
said. “It was a coming out party.”

W&L was ‘able to put pressure on Vir-
ginia Wesleyan’s defense from the outset,
controlling possession with crisp passing
and long sideline runs. _

The hard work paid off in the 27th min-
ute when Daigle corralled a loose ball in
the box, faked out the keeper and slid it
into the net.

“It was just kind of one-on-one with
the keeper and I just passed it” into the

goal, she said.

Energized by the lead, the Generals
used their speed to work the ball deep into
Virginia Wesleyan territory. Keeping the
ball around the goalmouth, W&L extend-
ed its advantage when a turnover allowed
Daigle to net her second goal in less than
ten minutes.

Virginia Welseyan responded shortly
after halftime, but Daigle’s third goal put
the game away.

The win was the Generals’ ﬁrst over
Virginia Wesleyan since 2004, a fact Cun-
ningham said made the victory even more
special.

“No one on this squad’s ever beaten
them,” he said. “It’s just nice because
it’s a benchmark, because they’re always
good and they’re always ranked, so to
beat them and to beat them comfortably
was really important to us.”

Though the winning margin was com-
fortable enough, the scene on the ﬁeld was
another story. Virginia Wesleyan played
physically the entire match to counter
W&L’s speed.

“They said it was going to be a tough
game,” said Daigle. “We came in with
the mentality that we were going to get
pushed around, but we just had to play our
game and get over it.”

Virginia Wesleyan racked up 17 fouls,
three yellow cards and one red card. The
ejection came, when a Marlins’ defender
took down sophomore forward Allie Espi-
na during a breakaway. The ensuing pen-
alty shot was blocked, but senior captain

. Maggie Sutherland put away the rebound

to make it 4-1.

The win pushes the Generals to 4-0
overall and 2-0 in the ODAC, an excellent
start for a young team that has lost a num-
ber of key players. Top scorer Anne Van
Devender, defender Marisa Van Brunt and
goalie Kiki Moreo all graduated last year.
But that has not slowed the team, thanks to
its depth and the strong early play of ﬁrst-
years Daigle and Hannah Sackﬁeld.

The nice thing is that we had a good
group of ﬁrst-years last year, and they’ve

 

played,” Cunningham said. “That one year
makes a big difference.” _

He pointed especially to the improve-
ment of sophomore defender Corinne
Smith and keeper Emily O’Leary.

“Corrine has really matured at the back,
and Emily has really changed what we can
do,” he said.

The solid defense has allowed W&L to

utilize all of its offensive weapons. Espina
and fellow sophomore forward Kat Barnes
have combined to record 12 points in just
four games, including three goals and an
assist in Wednesday’s 10-0 dismantling of
Sweet Briar. Sackﬁeld also scored twice in
that game.

The Generals will look to continue their
undefeated record as they take on Hollins
on Tuesday.

W&L hosts Rockbridge Rapids.

Smith Field home to inaugural season of collegiate league baseball team this summer

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

Classes were over and the students
were gone, but sports were alive and well

at Washington and Lee over the summer_

this year as the school played host to the
Rockbridge Rapids baseball team. ‘

The Rockbridge Rapids became the
twelfth team in the Valley Baseball League
with their inaugural season this year. The
other member teams come from cities
around the area including Covington, Fau-
quier County, Front Royal, Harrisonburg,
Staunton, and Woodstock. The league is
one of eight summer baseball leagues in
the country that provides regular compe-
tition for collegiate players. All members
must have completed at least one year of
college and still have some remaining eli-

gibility. Tagged the “Gateway to .the Ma-
jors,” the league is known for the large
number of ‘graduates’ who go on to play

- professional baseball.

Battling against frequent rain delays,
the Rapids ﬁnished the season with a dis-
appointing 9-33 record. Their record put

them in last place in the league, but for the ,
team’s organizers and promoters, the inau-

gural season was still a massive success.
The stated mission for the Rockbridge
Baseball Club is “to provide competitive,
exciting college baseball in a wholesome
fun family atmosphere for the enjoyment
of the people of Rockbridge County, Lex-
ington, and Buena Vista.” And with a total
fan turnout of 7,000 for the season, the

Rockbridge Rapids seem to have done just
that.

“Through the rain-outs and lightning
delays and bad pitching, our local fans
we’re absolutely wonderful,” said Ken
Newman, general manger for the Rapids.
“We averaged almost 350 fans a game and
that ranked us ﬁfth in the l2-team Valley

League. F or our ﬁrst year, we really think _
