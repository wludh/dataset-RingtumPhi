The facts
about drugs

Even light use can affect the

brain, says expert

By Eric Gehman
STAFF WRITER

Dr. Scott Swartzwelder, Professor of Psychology
at Duke University, visited Washington and Lee last
week to share the ﬁndings of his extensive research
on recreational drug abuse in Stackhouse Theater
last Thursday night.

His presentation, sponsored by LIFE, the IFC,
the Panhellenic Council and the Ofﬁce of Health
Promotion, focused on the long-term effects of alco-
hol on both the adolescent and adult brain. He then
opened the ﬂoor to abroader discussion about differ-
ent drugs like ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana.

Dr. Swartzwelder discussed at length his research
about how the adolescent brain, which can continue
developing through the age of 24, is far more sensi-
tive to the acute effects of alcohol abuse—especially
those essential to learning and memory.

According to his presentation, adolescence is a
period where the brain is “built to learn,” but even
light alcohol consumption can slow and dull the
hippocampus and the cerebellum, two regions of
the brain that are most important to the encoding of
information into long-term memory. These effects
can also become “locked-in,” and hinder the brain’s
ability to learn and form new memories well into
adulthood.

In an experiment which measured and compared
subjects’ ability to memorize and later reproduce a
complex geometric drawing, even a group of 21 to

24 year-olds was more affected by alcohol consump- .

tion than another experimental group aged just 25

“I would think that science would
be a compelling motivator for
W&L students to examine how
they use alcohol. ”

Jan Kaufman, director of health promotion

to 29. Another experiment documented the behav-
ior of subjects who were blackout drunk, during the
period in which they could not form new long-term
memories, 33 percent of subjectsiseriously insulted
someone, 16.3 percent were involved in an argument
or ﬁght, 24.8 percent engaged in sexual activity, 6.2
percent had unprotected sex and 2.5 percent even got
behind the wheel of a car. 5.1 percent of subjects
engaged in unwanted sexual activity.

The question-and-answer session after Swartz-
welder’s formal presentation opened the discussion
to other drugs that are abused heavily within the col-
lege environment. '

Marijuana was a popular topic of inquiry: many
students asked about its long-term effects on mood
and brain function. Contrary to popular belief,

Swartzwelder noted, there is no conclusive body of l

evidence to prove that moderate usage of pot can af-
fect cognition. ,

He also advocated that marijuana is less harmful
to the brain than alcohol—but he was quick to in-
clude that he believes no one should consume alco-
hol or cannabis before the age of 25. That is when the
brain stops signiﬁcant development processes and is
better equipped to handle the potentially harmful ef-
fects these drugs can cause.

Regarding cocaine, he talked about the addictive
drugs power to take over lives. “You make choices
you otherwise wouldn’t make because of the drug,”
he said in a tone of absolute gravity. He also noted
its “pharmacological speciﬁcity,” or its ability to af-
fect dopamine levels in the brain, which makes it so
highly addictive.

Jan Kaufman, director of health promotion, ex-
pressed her concern about binge drinking at W&L
but also her optimism , that students can change
drinking culture for the better.

“I would think that science would be a compel-
ling motivator for W&L students to examine how
they use alcohol,” said Kaufman, who noted that she
found it hard to imagine that “W&L students would
intentionally decrease their competitive advantage
in the classroom and in the future.”

After searching two houses
and conﬁscating drugs and
paraphernalia, police arrest
one former student and

investigate others

By Valaree Tang
STAFF WRITER

Lexington and Rockbridge Coun-
ty police have searched two student
residences and arrested one former
Washington and Lee student after an
18-month investigation involving the
illegal possession of narcotics.

Police implemented two search
warrants on Saturday, Jan 23. The
ﬁrst search was executed at an off-
campus student residence on Jef-
ferson Street. Later that night, law
enforcement oﬂicials searched an-
other off-campus residence located

‘on Winding Way, a house Inore com-

monly known to W&L students as
Down Wind. Items were seized from
both locations. .

Peter Joseph Martinez, 22, who
is no longer enrolled as a student at
W&L. was arrested on the felony
charge of possession of a controlled
substance with the intent to distrib-
ute. Students say that Maitinez was
attending classes earlier this term.

Police used an informant to make
multiple purchases from the Jefferson
Street apartment. Within 72 hours of
an informant’s purchase of a con-
trolled substance, police executed a

search warrant from said apartment.

In November, police had bought
.819 grams ofcocaine from Martinez.
The police department has video and
audio evidence ofthe drug sales.

Police recovered evidence that
supported MaItinez’s narcotic crimes
within the residence. Upon his arrest,
Martinez admitted to distributing co-
caine from his residence.

Martinez was released from Rock-
bridge Regional Facility on $5,000
unsecured bond early last Sunday

  

morning. His court appearance is
scheduled for April 27.

If convicted, Martinez may face
between ﬁve and 40 years impris-
onment, and ﬁned not more than
$500,000, according to the Code of
Virginia.

According to court records, police
conﬁscated 19 baggies of white pow-
der, a ﬁlm canister ﬁlled with green

in‘.

and observed cocaine at the Winding
Way premises, according to court re-
cords.

The address at Winding Way is
known to house members of Kappa
Alpha Order. Upon search of the

house, law enforcement ofﬁcials
seized a pill bottle with green plant
material. three bags and 74 smaller
bags of white powder substance.

“lt’s important that we, as a university, not pre-

judge anything in an on—going matter. When ap-

propriate, the university applies its policies and

procedures. ’

DAWN WATKINS, Dean of Students

plant material and drug parapherna-
lia, including a scale and marijuana
grinders.

Police seized 22.6 grams of the
white powder, and 3.6 grams of the
green plant. The substances were de-
termined by lab tests to be cocaine
and marijuana.

Because Martinez is no longer a
student at W&L, he is not under the
jurisdiction of the University or the
honor system.

Martinez provided information
during his interview with the Rock-
bridge County Sheriff’s Oﬂ”Ice Drug
Task Force that led to the second
search last Saturday, with the as-

. sistance of the Lexington police de-

partment. He said that he purchased

Police also conﬁscated a Grand
Cherokee Jeep, as well as $837 in
cash. Court records say that police
seized evidence of distribution.

Rockbridge County Sheriff Bob
Day said that the sheriff’s depart-
ment believes the substances conﬁs-
cated by police at Winding Way are
drugs. No arrests were made on site,
but an investigation continues.

The identities of the students in-

volved in the criminal activity at
Down Wind are not yet known.

Dean Dawn Watkins, vice presi-
dent for student affairs and dean of
students, said that the student hand-
book contains a clear no-tolerance
policy on the university’s criminal
and felonious activity.

 

The handbook appropriates sus-
pension to students who use or pos-
sess illegal drugs or controlled sub-
stances.

“lt’s important that we, as a uni-
versity, not pre-judge anything in an
ongoing matter. When appropriate,
the university applies its policies and
procedures,” said Dean Watkins.

Rumors that members of Kappa
Alpha are undergoing drug tests are
unconﬁrmed. lnterfratemity Council
president Garrott McClintock said
that he was unaware of the drug tests.
According to McClintock, no charges
have been brought forward and there
is no current investigation from the
IFC for Kappa Alpha. He said that all
he has heard are rumors.

Kappa Alpha Order, which was
founded in Lexington in 1865, is
one-third of the Lexington Triad. lts
national ofﬁce is located in Lexing-
ton. ’

The executive director of Kappa
Alpha, Larry Stanton Wiese, said that
he has only heard rumors as well.

“We don’t believe our chapter has
been involved with any illegal activ-
ity,” said Wiese, who also said that
the chapter is waiting for “some law
enforcement to occur.”

Wiese said that the chapter has
strict bylaws that prohibit illegal ac-
tivity, and that all members are ex-
pected to adhere to the policies.

Fraternity house ﬂoods

Student allegedly breaks pipe and ﬂoods Chi Psi basement, forcing party to evacuate

By Diandra Spicak
NEWS EDITOR

When students attended Chi Psi’s
“Late Nite” this Saturday#the fra-
ternity’s signature dance party that
usually begins at midnight—dancers
got drenched by more than sweat and
been

Surprised partygoers found them-
selves rushed out of the basement
and the fraternity house as about
600 gallons of water ﬂooded the ﬁrst
ﬂoor and the basement.

At about I a.m, a student who is
not a member of Chi Psi, reportedly
ripped a ﬁre sprinkler out of the ceil-
ing on the third ﬂoor, causing the
connecting pipe to break. Gallons

upon gallons of murky water cas-
caded down one of the stairwells and

into the lower ﬂoors.

As the water began to ﬁll up the
basement, the members of Chi Psi
began to hurry everyone out to avoid
injury and possible deaths. Due to
the large amount of equipment used
by the Late Nite disc jockey, DJ
Duane, members expressed concern
for the dancers and acted quickly in
rushing everyone out of the fraterni-
ty house and shutting down the party.
Ultimately, because of the Chi Psi
brothers‘ quick reactions and good
judgment, no one was hurt.

With the amount of water that
ﬂooded the house, some of DJ
Duane’s equipment suffered some
damage and will have to be replaced.
According to one of the brothers of
Chi Psi, DJ Duane could go through_
insurance or could even sue to make

S up the damage done to his equip-

ment.

Chi Psi, due to restrictions placed
on them by their Nationals, could
not comment on the situat'ion nor as
to what action will be taken against
the person who caused the ﬂooding
and water damage. However, inspec-
tors will be looking over the Chi Psi

house to determine the extent of the
damage. ’

But what about Chi Psi’s famed
dance party? The members have said
that, later on this term, Late Nite will
make a comeback, but for now, they
are focusing on putting the ends to-
gether and ﬁxing their house.

Habitat donates for homes in Haiti

W&L chapter of Habitat for Humanity receives money to provide transitional housing to homeless

By Paige Gance
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee
chapter of Habitat for Humanity
has received $2,076.90 to ﬁnance
transitional shelters for the disas-
ter-stricken people of Haiti.

Representatives from the
chapter appeared before the EC
to apply for the ﬁmds near the
beginning of the winter term. In
granting these funds, the EC took
into account the past successes
and future plans of W&L’s Habi-
tat chapter.

This donation, made in con-
junction with a $4,000 donation
from the Rockbridge County
Habitat, will pay for what Charles
Wilson, co-chair of W&L’s Hab-
itat Chapter, calls “a foundation
upon which you can build a nor-
mal home.”

These one-room houses cost
about $2,500 to construct, with
additional rooms costing around
$300 to $500. Instead of con-
crete, which is the preferred
building material in heavily
deforested Haiti, the roofs are

made of galvanized aluminum.
Whereas concrete roofs col-
lapsed easily under the strain of
an earthquake that ranked 7.0 on
the Richter scale, these roofs are
quake-resistant, a reassuring fact
given the aftershocks that contin-
ue to torment an already stricken
nation.

Experts estimate that the
number of displaced Haitians is
between 1 million and 1.5 mil-
lion, with over 200,000 homes
destroyed. This devastation has
forced residents to set up make-
shift shelters from earthquake
rubble. Often, their only protec-
tion from the elements is a thin
bed sheet set up on four sticks.

Those lucky enough to live
in tents still lack the water tanks
and latrines provided by the
Habitat shelters. As problems of
sanitation and illness threaten the
health of survivors, this equip-
ment could save lives.

W&L’s Habitat has a history
of helping those in need, both 10-
cally and abroad. This year alone
has seen $9,500 in funds raised

for Habitat homes in Rockbridge
County.

T-shirt sales and concession
stands have supplemented this
amount, but the bulk, according
to Wilson, comes from Habitat
Hotel. As W&L parents can at-
test, ﬁnding accommodations

goes toward building homes in
Rockbridge County.

Wilson said he hopes to ex-
pand Habitat Hotel to include the
days around graduation, as part of
the “innovative plans for the fu-
ture” mentioned in the chapter’s
last press release. Furthermore,

“The shelters are the ﬁrst step to getting the

people of Haiti back into viable housing and

reconstructing the nation is capital. ”

Habitat for Humanity press release
 

near campus during Parents’
Weekend can be a nightmare.
Habitat Hotel creatively solves
this problem while raising mon-
ey for the organization by ask-
ing faculty members to rent out
extra rooms in their homes for a
reasonable fee. All the revenue

the chapter has raised enough
funds this past year to qualify for
a State Farms matching grant of
$5,000, a goal it hopes to achieve
annually.

It is these past accomplish-
ments and promises of future
success that led the EC to allo-

cate funds for Habitat. Usually,
the major assignment of funds
occurs in the spring, and only
clubs and organizations that have
run out of cash reapply for funds
in the winter.

However, the earthquake in
Haiti created special and un-
expected circumstances, and
chapter leaders said they felt this
humanitarian crisis called for
addition funds on top of those
already committed to the Rock-
bridge homes.

According to a press release,
“The shelters are the ﬁrst step to
getting the people of Haiti back
into viable housing and recon-
structing the nation’s capital.”

The poorly designed build-
ings and shoddy construction
materials contributed heavily
to the high rate of building col-
lapse, according to a recent New
York Times article.

The components of the most‘

common material, concrete, are
expensive to import, causing
manufacturers to add dangerous
amounts of sand to the mix. Add

to this the lack of strict building
codes and the construction of
homes on unstable hillsides, and
the stage is set for mass devasta-
tion.

The Habitat shelters will not
only provide immediate relief
to Haiti’s survivors but also the
beginnings ofa permanent infra-
structure stronger than the previ-
ous.

People interested in contrib-
uting to Habitat for Humanity or
in getting involved can contact
Dan Walz, executive director for
Rockbridge area, at Dan.Habi-
rat@rockbridge.net, or contact
Charles Wilson, co-chair, at Wil-
soncb10@mail. wlu. edu.

Eating well, eating local in d-hall

W&L is dining services are increasing their efforts to incorporate foods produced in county and lﬁrginia

By Chelsea Stevenson
8 TA F F W R IT E R

Have you ever eaten in the
Marketplace, the law school, one
of the ﬁve sorority houses, or
at a catered event at W&L? Of
course. But during your experi-
ence did you really think about
what you were putting in your
mouth? Probably not.

What you most likely did not
realize is that in eating through
W&L’s dining services, you’re.
doing more than just consuming
tasty meals, you’re helping mul-
tiple parts of the community.

Over the past three years,
W&L has increased its local food
use to nearly 18 percent. The
dining services staff now looks
in the surrounding areas ﬁrst, to
ﬁnd foods such as honey, milk,
chicken, apples, berries and pea-
nut butter.

The search begins in Rock-
bridge County. W&L’s beef,
for example, comes from Char-

lie Potter’s Buffalo Creek Beef
company. Next, the search for
foods expands to the food shedof
the Shenandoah Valley.

Chris Carpenter, the special
projects coordinator in the cater-
ing department, explained that
the Shenandoah Valley is one
of the major food valleys in the
US. Our pork loin comes from
the Shenandoah.

Local foods also extend state-
wide. For example, apples come
from Nelson County, just 60
miles away from W&L, and pea-
nut butter comes from the Appo-
mattox region on the soutli side
of Virginia. Local foods here at
W&L also extend throughout the
south region of the U.S.

Carpenter’s role in search-
ing for local foods is to visit
each farm, looking for farmers
who can produce their goods at
the quantity and volume W&L
needs. He said has no complaints
about his the local food search.

“It’s like getting paid to hang
out with a farmer,” Carpenter
said.

The one problem that Carpen-
ter said he often runs into during
his search for local foods is that
farmers oﬁen do not have the ca-
pability to produce the volume
W&L needs. For one month’s ,
worth of meals in the Market-
place alone, W&L needs 150
chickens. However, according to
Marketplace chef Geraldine Mc-
Cutcheon, giving local farmers
these high quantitiy orders helps
their market and ensires that they
continuously have a client.

' McCutcheon also commented
on the beneﬁts eating locally has
on the community. She that be-
cause W&L is a small university
in a small town, working person-
ally with farmers helps improve
the community ties. The fact that
W&L has formed several close
relationships with Virginia farms
has encouraged other universi-

ties to do the same.

At the Homestead Creamery
in Burnt Chimney, Va., just out-
side of Roanoke, several other
universities have joined W&L
in creating a conjunction for the
creamery’s milk, a favorite of
Chef McCutcheon and Assis-
tant Director of Cafe ‘77 Dennis
Fowler. Because of this, Home-
stead Creamery has improved its
equipment by purchasing a small
processor to meet the local high
demand. One of these universi-
ties is Virginia Tech.

Eating locally helps the farm-
ers, but it also improves the sus-
tainability and energy efﬁciency
in the community, said Carpen-
ter.

He explained the reduction
in energy usage by comparing
the transportation of Washington
apples to W&L to the transporta-
tion of Virginia apples. Washing-
ton apples, which come in 40-48
a case, take 3,500 carbon miles

and several days to transport.

Apples from a Virginia or-
chard, although only 17 a case,
takes 60 carbon miles and are
overall fresher. Therefore, eat-
ing locally undoubtedly results
in a signiﬁcantly lower carbon
footprint.

Dwight Bitz, assistant direc-
tor of the Brief Stop at the law
school, explained that using local
foods also causes less packaging
waste and implements recycling.
The Homestead Creamery and
Buffalo Creek Beef, among sev-
eral other companies, reuse tubs
and glass bottles through a de-
pository system.

The ﬁnal beneﬁt to eating
locally affects ‘the entire W&L
community. Eating local foods is
simply healthier. The local meats
contain no hormones or antibiot-
ics and in theory are organic, just
without the certiﬁcation.

Carpenter explained that our
bodies are able to break down

the local foods faster because
they do not contain high fructose
corn syrup.

“Better taste simply means
better nutrition,” Carpenter said.

New options for pre-law students

Consultant expands pre-law program, including advice on the Web and a spring term job opportunity

By Llzz Dye
STAFF WRITER

Pre-Law Studies has always
been a great resource for Wash-
ington and Lee students inter-
ested in law school. Abigail
Perdue, Special Consultant to
the Pre-Law Program, hopes to
expand Pre-Law Studies and rec-
ommended that faculty and stu-
dents attend a Mock Law School
Admission Committee Meeting
on J an. 28.

This meeting V provided

“unique insight into the law
school decision-making process,”
according to a press release from
Perdue. Representatives from
George Washington University
"Law School, the University of
Richmondkschool of Law, and
the Charleston School of Law
provided students with unique
insight into how law schools
make their admission decisions.
Its goal was to help students re-
ally see how the law schools are
going to see them and make their
decisions.

Some common questions that
students ask when applying to
law school include whether to
list Greek life as an extracurricu-
lar activity on a resume. Perdue,

, who is a W&L alum herself, said

she hopes to help studies more
easily answer these questions by
enhancing the pre-law resources
available to students.

One way of doing this is pre-

law advising. There are already
two existing pre-law advisors,
Dr. Robert Culpepper and Pro-
fessor Lucas Morel, both located
in the C-school. V
Perdue has also created a pre-
law Web site which launched
in December. She is constantly
maintaining and updating it. It
includes internship information,
tips on how to decide whether to
go to law school and law courses
currently offered, among many
other resources. To ﬁnd the web-
site, go to the W&L Web site and
search “Pre-Law Studies.”
There is a also a new student-
run group called “Generals Inter-
ested in Legal Studies” (GILS).
Senior Alex Caritis is the presi-
dent of the newly elected board.
These students are responsible
for planning social and speaking
events related to law school.
Caritis said the main goal is
to “show the administration that
people do have interest in pre-
law” and to “increase exposure to
both law school and the various
facets of the legal profession.”
A new pre-law mentoring pro-
gram has also been established:
Law School Liaisons. It matches
up undergraduates interested in
law with W&L law students, like
the Big Brother/Sister program.
Perdue says that it is an “informal
way to breach the gap between
law school and undergrads.”
Workshops and sessions are

held to give students insight into
law school. Earlier this year, for
example, a W&L alum who is at
Yale Law School and works at
admissions there was brought in
to speak. An LSAT prep work-

shop is provided to give advice‘

about preparations. A Kaplan
teacher was also brought in to
give tips on the LSAT.

Another speaker who was
brought in was Professor Kim
Forde-Marzui. He is the Direc-
tor of the Center for the Study of
Race and Law for UVA. He gave
a talk on same-sex marriage ear-
lier this year and how it pertains
the legal battles going on cur-
rently.

Perdue has worked out a
Spring Option for Pre-Law
where a student, preferably a se-
nior, will be able to work at Blue
Ridge Legal Services under the
supervision of an attorney. This
provides a great legal intem-
ship for those interested in law
school.

She also hasinforrnation on
law school by major and how
different majors should go about
applying for law school. She is
currently updating the pre-law
bulletin board in the C—School to
increase awareness of the avail-
ability of pre-law resources.

She said that she is impressed
with the student body and excit-
ed_about the future of the pre-law
resources at the school.

Perdue is also offering cours-
es pertaining to pre-law. Last
semester, she taught the course
INTR 180, which dealt with di-
versity and discrimination and

appointment in higher education. '

Students in the class read cases,
did legal research and participat-
ed in a mock trial. A law school
professor served as the judge, and
the jury consisted of students not
in the class as well as the dean of
the college.

In the spring she is teach-
ing INTR 220, “American Law:
Great Cases and Controversies,”
which will focus on controversial
issues in American law. Students
will be using legal resources, do-
ing legal drafting and reading ac-
tual cases. The goal will be how
to learn to think and write like a
lawyer.

Six seniors to teach

for America

Students will spend two years after graduation teaching in low-income school systems for T FA

By Katy Stewart
STAFF WRITER

Some seniors worry about
ﬁnding a job after graduation, but
six Washington and Lee seniors
plan to embark on a challenging,

_ eye-opening, two-year teaching

experience: Teach for America.
Becca Beeson, Beth Brantley,
Alex Caritis, Kim Holland, Josh
Gonzalez and Zach Segall will
represent W&L around the coun-
try in low income school systems,
working to “eliminate education-
al inequality,” TFA’s cornerstone
goal. W&L has produced a di-
verse mix of TFA participants,

but they all share a common trait:

their W&L experience led them
to TFA and prepared them to un-
dertake this responsibility.

The program recruits students
from all academic backgrounds,
but everyone must exhibit strong
leadership skills. Beeson found
leadership opportunities dur-
ing her W&L years working for
Head Start at the local Waddell
Elementary School. Next year
she will teach elementary stu-
dents in Dallas. "

Segall also demonstrated

strong leadership skills through
fraternity and Outing Club in-

pi

 

volvement, and will be working
with special needs children in
Phoenix.

TFA does not mandate any
teaching experience, but Holland
said she found that her Founda-
tions of Education course piqued
her interest in teaching. The class
discussed the education system’s
inequality and achievement gap,
which is linked to socioeconomic
status.

Gonzalez, who will work in
the San Francisco area, consid-
ers Teach for America “a logical
next step,” combining his interest
in teaching with his background
in athletic leadership.

TFA identiﬁed these students’
strengths and potential impact,
selecting them from an impres-
sive pool of applicants. Beeson
recalls a 2009 Wall Street Jour-
nal figure, that “ll percent of Ivy
League seniors apply,” so W&L’s
statistic of six students is praise-
worthy, especially considering
the rigorous application proce-
dure.

The process begins with a
phone interview. In the second
round, TFA invites students to



  P     
p    

what Beeson calls a “grueling
day—long interview process,” in-
volving group discussions, timed
essays, logic puzzles and teach-
ing simulations. Students are
asked to present a ﬁve-minute
lesson plan, write a mock letter
to parents and hold a one-on-one
interview. ‘ Beeson, who will be
teaching English as a second lan-

versity. The two years teaching
in low-income schools makes all
six students “very nervous,” as
Gonzalez put it, because of the
“big task to help.”

“lt’s a big responsibility,” he
said.

Yet the W&L experience pro-
vided adequate tools for the chal-
lenges of teaching urban youth,

“[My] whole W&L experience culminates

with TFA. ”

 j—::

guage, also took a Spanish test.
F or,these students, the under-
taking is not just another resume
builder. Holland explained that
the TFA program is an opportu-
nity to “help as many people as
possible and make an impact.”
Segall likewise chose TFA “in
pursuit of achieving results.” The
motivation behind the program
comes from the desire to close
the achievement gap, despite ad-

according to Holland. She attri-
butes her leadership experience
to the Pan-Asian Association for
Cultural Exchange (PAACE) and
said she thinks this group fostered
her “perspective of different cul-
tures,” both of Asian cultures
and multiculturalism in general.
She has confidence in her orga-
nization and cooridination skills,
much afforded by managing her
busy W&L schedule.

ayiuun

In addition to classroom
management skills, Beeson and
Gonzalez cited extracurricular
opportunities as advantages to-
ward achieving teaching success.
Beeson said that her “whole
W&L experience culminates
with TFA.” She studied with
the Shepherd Poverty Program,
served as English for Speakers
of Other Languages co-chair and
worked for Senator Ted Kennedy
during Washington Term. Her-
work with ESOL and education
policy motivated her application
to TFA.

Swimming instilled values
of determination and persever-
ance, said Gonzalez, critical
traits teachers need. He thinks
the W&L environment allows
students “the opportunity to do
whatever you want and find what
you’re good at.”

Beyond the two-year teach-
ing commitment, the students
are looking to the future. They
named ideas such as law school,
graduate school in teaching and
public policy, the army and con-
tinuing teaching. One thing is
sure: the next two years hold a

steep learning curve. lnner-city
schools separate the dedicated
teacher from the half-hearted.

Heart counts the most in win-
ning a spot at TFA. When asked
to advise W&L students inter-
ested in TFA, all emphasized
the need for passion: this job is
not for someone who just needs
a post—graduation gig. Holland
recommended that students thor-
oughly prepare for the tough in-
terview process. Beeson recalled
that her creativity in the mock-
lesson plan set her apart, and
Gonzalez suggested researching
the organization as much as pos-
sible before applying and inter-
viewing.

High-speed rail production not practical  

Obama is plan to revitalize American high-speed rail does not live up to rhetoric

By Jarrett Brotzman
C 0 L U M N l ST

On Wednesday evening,
President Obama addressed the
nation in the annual tradition of
the State of the Union address.

The speech wasﬁlled with
all we would have expected to
hear: not-so-subtle jabs at House
Republicans for blocking liberal
legislative items, compliments
of Michelle’s work, talk of
hope and change and, of course,
vague spending agenda items
with little mention of how these

vast spending increases would

be covered.

But between the all the “let
me clear,” “make no mistake,”
and “change won’t be easy”
Obamaisms that we have all
come to know and love, there
was one item in particular that
stuck out to me as an intriguing
item on his aggressive agenda
plan for Year 2: high-speed rail.

This projected $8 billion pro-
gram to bring high-speed rail
to many areas across America
strikes me as one of the more ef-
fective ways to spend stimulus
money. ‘

According to White House
spokesmen Bill Burton, this
investment is the largest infra-
structure investments in Ameri-
ca since the construction of the
Interstate Highway System in
1956.

The ‘long-term beneﬁts seem
pretty substantial: they are pro-
jected to include lowering reli-
ance on foreign oil, increasing
commerce between cities linked
by high-speed rail, lowering
transportation by airplane within
inter—country travel and reduc-
ing overall emissions across the
country as more commuters sub-
stitute train travel for short- and
medium-distance commutes.

These beneﬁts paint a very
rosy picture of future American
travel, where the difference in
technology between domestic
rail lines and efficient European
rail have been compared to the
gap between “the planes ﬂown
by World War I ﬂying aces and
today’s jets,” says Anthony Perl,
chairman of the National Re-
search Council’s intercity rail
panel

The $8 billion investment

Massachusetts was a mes-
sage from liberal Democrats to
Obama and . Democratic mem-
bers of Congress: Quit playing
Mr. Nice Guy, grow a pair, ﬂy
the middle ﬁnger in the faces of
obstructionist Republicans and
get something done.

Obama’s attempts at bipar-
tisanship have been admirable.
However, now that we have es-
tablished that the Republicans
will oppose everything Demo-
crats say and do, I thinklthat it
is safe to say that the time for
bipartisanship is over.

Let me throw out a few facts.
Fact: Expecting Republicans
to help get healthcare reform
passed is ridiculous.

Fact: Olympia Snowe does
not give a damn about anyone
other than Olympia Snowe.

Fact: Voters will blame you
for not having solved a problem
you didn’t create. Get over it.

as part of the National Recov-
ery Act is intended to narrow
the gap. However, the reality of
Obama’s recently announced in-
vestments is a more complicated
picture than the Federal Rail-
road Administration would like
to portray.

Fact: Obstruction makes great
politics and bad policy.

Once these facts are estab-
lished, maybe Obama and Con-
gressional Democrats can begin
to see that moving to the right to
appease the LiberDems and Re-
publicans is not working.

Every time Obama has moved
to the right, the middle class has
gotten screwed over: the stimu-
lus bill, the Wall Street bail-
out (bonuses? Really?) and the
healthcare debacle. This is the
source of the brewing populist
outrage.

I think that Obama is begin-
ning to see the light. In his State
of the Union address, it sounded
like Obama is starting to under-
stand where the populist outrage
lies and is changing his tone.

Obama was elected on a plat-
form of change, and now the time
for change has come. Change
is never easy—especially if it

can company currently has the
technology or manufacturing ca-
pacity to develop or build these
trains. Transportation Secretary
Ray LaHood and members of
Congress have acknowledged
this lack of industrial capacity.

I don’t see this as an issue;

The bottom line—Obama is vision of this

stimulus creating high-paying, permanent

American jobs is at best overly optimistic

and at worst a pipe dream.

One overlooked difficulty is
the current state of “high-speed
rail” in the U.S. In America,
high-speed rail is more misno-
mer than reality.

There currently exists one—
that’s right, one—high-speed
line in the United States. It is
Amtrak’s Acela line that oper-
ates between Boston and Wash-
ington, D.C., which does reach
a maximum speed of 150 mph,
but really averages just 67 mph
between Boston and New York,
and 77 mph between New York
and Washington.

The vast majority of other in-
tercity rail in the United States
averages less than 80 mph (A.P.,
I/28). This is a far cry from Eu-
ropean and Japanese rail speeds,
where lines in France and Japan
average 169 mph and 159 mph,
respectively.

Proposed routes promise to
reach high speeds of around 220
mph in California between Sac-
ramento and San Diego, and 150
mph in Florida between Tampa
and Orlando. Unfortunately, av-
erage speeds in Florida will only
be around 86 mph, a reality far
from the optimistic outlook giv-
en by the Department of Trans-
portation announcement.

Another snag in the adminis-
tration’s plan to use high-speed
rail as a catalyst for high-paying
American job creation is the un-
fortunate reality that no Ameri-

foreign competitive advantage
will result in foreign ﬁrms, such
as Siemens and Central Japan
Railway Co., building this new
infrastructure, using American
workers in lower-paying work
such as construction and lower-
tech development.

Eventually, American ﬁrms
might be able to efﬁciently build
this technology, but any new
“Buy American” provisions
would only result in inferior rail

messes with the status quo and
big money interests.

Let’s see if Obama can deliv-
er on the promises of his State of
the Union address.

technology.

The bottom line—Obama’s
vision of this stimulus creat-
ing high-paying, permanent
American jobs is at best overly
optimistic and at worst a pipe
dream.

The reality of current high-
speed rail plans is far different
from what the Obama adminis-
tration would like to portray.

In the short term, it does have
the potential to make a small
diﬁ°erence in the unemployment
rate and improve current rail
travel, but this plan is no magic
bullet to the 10 percent unem-
ployment problem.

Indeed, “change won’t be
easy” and no stimulus bill can
ﬁx the underlying issue of lag-
ging consumer demand in the
economy. 8 billion dollars is a
good start, but to really improve
American rail travel and to reach
the infrastructure quality of Eu-
rope and Japan, a more serious
investment needs to be made:
one without any “Buy Ameri-
can” provisions and with open-
ness to foreign rail ﬁrms.

Bringing theenergy back to winter-term parties

If your party night pre-games need a little ﬂair, Stop-In can caﬂeinate your night with some new, exciting beverages

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Having a successful pre-game
is getting harder and harder these
days.

The days are darker, the se-
mester is in full swing and in
case you haven’t noticed, there’s
quite a bit of snow on the ground.
It seems like by the time you ﬁ-
nally. ﬁnish a paper, .it’s already
time to head out to Windfall.

Gone are the lazy autumn
days when you can spend all
your free time gleefully tailgat-
ing football games and slowly
getting wasted at a snail’s pace.

This is the winter, when
vodka shots with ice tea chasers
seem like the most efficient way
to race your way to drunkenness.
Let’s be honest: the only real
reason Russians made vodka in
the ﬁrst place was to make their
harsh winters a little warmer.

But the problem is, shots can
get boring after a while, and
furthermore, isn’t there a much
more efﬁcient way to somehow
mix the beneﬁts of vodka and
Red Bull into one, tasty drink?
Okay, vodka-Red Bulls don’t
count, just work with me here.

Just in case you’re still hav-
ing trouble ﬁguring out exactly
what l’m alluding to, your local
Stop-ln has the answer.

The key to your winter pre-
gaming happiness is situated be-
tween the caffeinated beverages
aisle and the sealed-off cases,
forties, mixers and other won-
derfully alcoholic beverages.

Why

The alcoholic energy drinks
do exactly what you need from
them, when you need them.

They taste surprisingly pal-
atable for a malt beverage, and
they make sure that you wait for
the last Traveller ride home to
end your fun night. Also, they
provide the foundation for hav-
ing a good night at Washington
and Lee parties speciﬁcally.

Once you get deep into the
country, a consistent «supply of
alcohol is always hard to come

by. Luckily, these alcohol-rid- ‘

den energy drinks don’t really
hit you that hard until long after
they have been consumed. That
would be quite dangerous at
most schools, but cures ‘a prob-
lem here in Lexington.

Furthermore, all that danc-
ing and listening to prospective
hook-ups talk about irrational
things like feelings and opin-
ions can take a lot out of you.
You’re going to need that inﬂux
of caffeine, guarine and taurine
right around the time “Tik Tok”
comes on.

So, now that you are inevita-
bly sold on this wonderful new
addition to your life, how do you
decide what to buy?

Well, if you are looking for
a relatively tame night or you
are not quite sure if you are re-
ally sold on the best liquid since
Gucci Mane’s “Lemonade,” then
you should probably divert your
attention towards the smaller

drinks such as Sparks, Tilt, or
Joose.

These drinks are slightly less
intimidating than their competi-
tors and probably taste a little
better to boot. Unfortunately,
due to pressure from the FDA
(the least fun of the federal ad-
ministrations), Anheuser-Busch
and Miller have taken the caf-
feine out of Sparks and Tilt--so

can reach before the intervention
that will no doubt happen in a
couple of months.

Four Loko and Max are pre-
game behemoths that ensure a
mistake-ridden night. Both con-
tain over 22 ounces of liquid that
is more than l0 percent alcohol,
and both have enough sugar to
be over 500 calories.

God himself could not have

The good news about these drinks [...] is

that you are ensured to be bouncing heartily

along to DJ Tiesto all night.

while they provide a little boost,
they don’t have that same kick
that Joose does.

Plus, according to reports
from various sources, Joose deﬁ-
nitely has the advantage when it
comes to both taste and variety of
ﬂavors. So you can either choose
safety with Sparks or joyous-
ness with Joose, and since you
are already dangerous enough to
be pre-gaming with one of these
things, you might as well go all
out and trust Joose’s sublime ef-
fect on your night.

For those of you who aren’t
satiated by the effect these drinks
have on your glutamate recep-
tors, there is another step you

you should change

the channel to “Friday
Night Lights”

With so much junk that airs on television these days,
“Friday Night Lights ” stands out as great entertainment

By Tyler Burchett
COLU M N I sr

“Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t
lose.”

This is the favorite saying
of one of the greatest football
coaches in television history. I
am referring of course to Eric
Taylor, coach of the Dillon Pan-
thers on the hit NBC show “Fri-
day Night Lights.”

lfyou have not yetjumped on
the “Friday Night Lights” band-
wagon then, simply put, you are
missing out on the best show on
television.

the other hand, there are so many
types of teenagers portrayed
among the players that it creates
an incredibly plausible world
ﬁlled with believable characters
who struggle with real-life deci-
sions and intense emotions.
Then there are the adults who
attempt to be mentors to their
children, when half of them are
screw-ups themselves.
Ultimately, the thing that
sets “Friday Night Lights” apart
as a show is the way that it de-

There are countless scenes in the show

that manage to hit home, both emotion-

ally and personally. It is impossible to

watch the show without being changed, at

least to a small degree.

The fourth season of the show
is set to air over the summer on
NBC. The show was inspired
by both the book and the movie
of the same name, depicting the
lives and struggles of high school
football players in Texas.

However with the show now
in its fourth season, it has cov-
ered more ground and spoken on
more controversial issues than
the two-hour movie, or the novel
ever could.

There are several elements
of the show, and many different
story lines that interconnect in
an incredibly heartfelt and real-
istic way.

There is such a variety of
characters and personalities on
the show that virtually anyone
can ﬁnd a character to whom
they can relate. There are the
football players, who make up
the teen element of the show. On

picts the emotions and interac-
tions between people. There
are countless scenes in the show
that manage to hit home, both
emotionally and personally. It
is impossible to watch the show
without being changed, at least
to a small degree.

Football is the glue that con-
nects all of the characters in the
show, but in reality the show is
about dealing with life, and the
pressures and trials involved
with growing up.

The show features a few ac-
tors from the ﬁlm version of
“Friday Night Lights.” The
most prominent of these is Con-
nie Britton, who plays Coach
Taylor’s wife in the show. She
also played Billy Bob Thom-
ton’s wife in the ﬁlm.

But it is the new characters
that make the show so incredi-
ble. The most important of these

is Coach Eric Taylor, played by
Kyle Chandler. He and Connie
Britton make up the heart of the
show. Kyle Chandler plays an
intense football coach who is the
model of what a coach should
be.

He gives his players guidance
both on and off the ﬁeld, and is a
mentor to his players, especially
when they need him the most.
His no-nonsense approach to
both football and life is a calm-
ing inﬂuence during some of the
turbulent events that occur in the
show.

Some of the most powerful
and inspiring scenes involve him
talking to his players. All of the
football players and teenagers
are new characters, who were
not in the movie.

Do yourself a favor, and
watch “Friday Night Lights.”
No other show comes even close
to capturing the complete spec-
trum of human interactions and
emotions the way that this one
does.

If you watch this show you
will laugh, you will cry, your
heart will break for the char-
acters and most important, the
characters will inspire and uplift
you.

There is still time to catch
up before the fourth season pre-
mieres this summer on NBC.
Watch the show. There are so
few good shows on television
today that you would be denying
yourself one of the greatest plea-
sures available to you.

crafted a better antagonist to the
Health Center.

Just watch out though, be-
cause there is no way that you
are successfully having a Patrick
Bateman kind of love session if
you have one too many of these
babies. In other words, accom-
pany every can with at least an
extra ten minutes in the gym.

The good news about these
drinks, on the other hand, is that
you are ensured to be heartily
bouncing along to DJ Tiesto all
night due to both beverages’ gar-
gantuan caffeine levels.

Both Four Loko and Max do
apparently taste wonderful and
have such delightful, myriad

ﬂavors that you are sure to be
pleasantly surprised whenever
you legally purchase them.

However, even I have to say
that it would be best to proceed
with caution. Like Chi Psi Late
Night, it’s best done every once
in a while rather than every
night.

Now, you’ve no doubt heard
some bad press about all of these

drinks. Pretty much every sin-
gle campus administrator will
tell you that these drinks are as
positive as Tear Night.

In November, the FDA gave
all 30 companies who put caf-
feine in alcoholic drinks an ulti-
matum about ﬁnding a test that
shows a positive correlation
between putting alcohol in caf-
feinated beverages. I know that

you’re not going to believe this,
but none of the companies could
ﬁnd any positive health effects
about mixing caffeine and alco-
hol. Yes, it’s also true that drink-
ing these drinks is downright ter-
rible for your heart.

But here’s the problem with
all that logic: what’s positive
about most ofthe stuff people do
here?

What’s positive about ripping
shots, playing pong and doing
keg stands‘? -

What’s positive about driving

“ to Wendy’s at ll:58‘ p.m. only

three hours after you had din-
ner?
What’s positive about stand-

ing outside in the freezing cold
at County Seat waiting for that
extra beer at 1:30?

If there’s nothing positive
about any of these things, then
why do we do them? The simple
answer is because all of those
things are either fun or somehow
serve to make our fun night just .
a little bit more exciting.

l’m not writing this article to
get you to Max out on life. Nor
am I going to write a diatribe
against morally irresponsible as-
pects of your life that will make
me a pariah to some and a hero
to the constituency that simply
wants to make themselves feel
better for not being like “those
people.” i

I think that if you do want to
have a fun pre-game, maybe one
of these drinks could help your
night out a little bit.

Just remember, too many keg
stands, Wendy’s runs or freezing
cold nights can all lead you to
not having fun,just like shotgun-
ning a Four Loko can lead to you
not having fun.

That being said, they still are
pretty damn tasty.

Oh, and of course wait until
you’re 21 to read this article. But
you of course wouldn’t fathom
doing something illegal. What’s
positive about illegality?

Eargasmic new tunes from WLUR

Washington and Lee campus radio oﬂers three of the station library is hot new albums fresh from the airwaves to you

By WLUR Staff
STAFF WRITERS

The cast of classic albums
for 2010 is already piling up.
Here are some more to add to the
stack: '

Beach House
Teen Dream (Sub Pop)

2009 was undoubtedly a ban-
ner year for music; is it possible
that 2010 could duplicate its pre-
decessor? Here’s one key simi-
larity: a record that comes out in
January dazzles from start to ﬁn-
ish, shows that the band behind
it is moving toward pop without
sacriﬁcing any artistic merit, and
withstands whatever great albums
the rest of the year throws at it
to take its rightful place on year-
end best-of lists. As with Animal
Collective’s Merriweather Post
Pavilion, that has happened and
will happen for Beach House’s
Teen Dream, the Maryland duo’s
third full-length, and first for in-
die superlabel Sub Pop.

In the spirit of full disclo-
sure, we at WLUR are big fans
of Beach House. Devotion, the
band’s second LP, was a favor-

ite record of 2008. We had ex-
tremely high expectations for the
album, and it exceeds them in
every way. Victoria Legrand and
Alex Scally have created a work
that is as captivating as their ﬁrst
two records, but at the same time
more accessible than the pop-
piest tunes that they’d put out
before. As alluringly gloomy as
Grizzly Bear’s Yellow House—
Legrand is a frequent collabora-
tor with that band~or Summer
Sun-era Yo La Tengo, this record
is still so easy to get into that it’s
scary. (Devotion was deﬁnitely
a grower.) Legrand’s vocals,
which fall somewhere between
Nico and Hope Sandoval, are a
bit more prominent here, soaring
over the band’s layers of organ,
keyboards, guitar, percussion
and bells.

There isn’t a weak link on this

packed on Saturday night with
supporters and onlookers, who
cheered and booed at the 27
groups that participated.

Starting at 9 p.m., hosts Chris
Washington and David Gilbert
first introduced the Greek house
moms, who got a little sassy this
year. Flaunting their boas and
throwing fake money into the
crowd brought cheers from all‘,
especially those who reside in
the Greek houses with them.

Though competition was
tough, Phi Psi won ﬁrst place with
a high-energy dance to “Good
Vibrations” by Marky Mark and
the Funky Bunch. Their perfor-
mance had many intricate dance
moves, but the human steps, the
high jump between legs and the
ending (when the dancers tore
their shirts to reveal. their Greek
letters on their chests) deﬁnitely
stood out.

Second place went to the
Alpha Delta Pi group that per-
formed a well-rehearsed piece to
a mash-up of songs. The crowd
fell in love with their clever cho-
reography when Taylor Swift’s
“Love Story” came on and the
girls held up their ADPi diamond
hand sign to symbolize an en-
gagement ring.

KLAZICS, always a crowd
favorite, took home third place.
Though Lady Gaga was a com-
mon theme in many ofthe dances
throughout the night, KLAZICS’
Gaga had the most authentic hair,
outﬁt and moves. However, the

Phi guys got into it and knew
how to please the crowd. The
stripping of their shirts, which
they threw to the audience, only
added to the loud cheering.

Kappa Alpha Theta had ev-
eryone laughing with their foam
star costumes, and Kappa Kappa
Gamma pulled out some surpris-
ingly thug hip-hop moves in their
second performance.

Sigma Chi’s excellent song
choice of “Dirty Talk” by Wyn-
ter Gordon caught everyone’s at-
tention but ended up making the
audience cringe, as man thongs"
were exposed toward the end of
their dance.

A personal favorite, the Beta
Theta Pi guys performed “She
Wolf’ by Shakira and had the
costumes down to a T. A large
cage prop was even used, simi-
lar to the one that appears in the
music video.

Phi Delta Theta deserves
credit for wearing such tight
pants, and Phi Kappa Sigma pro-
vided an interesting end to the
night after a creative remake of
the Taylor Swift music video,
“You Belong With Me.”

All the proceeds from Lip
Sync help to ﬁght hunger in
Rockbridge County. Each group
that entered paid a fee of $200

students who came to watch paid
an entrance fee of $8.

  Making history at Randolph-Macon

Men is basketball beats Randolph-Macon College 65-5 7, defeating the Yellow Jackets at Randolph-Macon for the ﬁrst time in over 50 years

By Hank Nathan V‘
STAFF WRITER

For the ﬁrst time in over 50 years, the
Washington and Lee men’s basketball
team defeated ninth-ranked Randolph-
Macon College on the road. The Gener-
als knocked off the Yellow Jackets 65-
57. The Generals‘ then continued their
momentum against Randolph College,
winning 64-46, to sweep the two-game
road trip.

On Wednesday, the Blue and White
put an end to some negative history by
winning at Randolph-Macon for the ﬁrst
time since the 1958-1959 season.

“I am extremely proud of our guys
for ending that streak,” said Coach
Adam Hutchinson. “Fifty years is a long
time to go without winning at an oppos-
ing team’s gym. Our guys were very
focused and _committed to getting that
win.”

The Generals opened up the scoring
on a fade-away jumper from the foul
line by ﬁrst-year forward Jeremy Adkins
who got a rare start. Randolph-Macon
immediately responded with a layup,
but Adkins scored again on the next pos-
session. The game remained tight early
on and the score was knotted at 14-14
after senior forward Zac White scored
on a layup.

W&L scored on its next two posses-
sions on a layup by senior forward An-
drew Payne and a dunk by ﬁrst-year for-
ward JD Ey after stealing the ball at half
court. The score was 18-14 at 1 1:12 and-
the Generals would never look back, not
relinquishing the lead for the rest of the
game.

The Generals continued to advance
their lead as senior forward Ben Goetsch
and Payne combined for 16 points in the
ﬁrst half. With six seconds remaining
in the ﬁrst frame, White hit a 3-pointer
from the right wing, making the score
41-30 at the break.

In the ﬁrst half, W&L shot a stagger-
ing 66.7 percent from the ﬁeld and con-
nected on seven of seven free throws.
Despite averaging 20 turnovers per
game this season, the Generals had only
six turnovers in the ﬁrst frame, while the
Yellow Jackets had nine.

“Concentration,” said junior guard
Jason Cimino, was how the squad cut
down on turnovers. “Our team has suf-
fered from lack of focus all season, and
that lack of focus causes turnovers. Dur-
ing the Randolph-Macon game, every-
one was paying attention and very fo-
cused, and, therefore, we didn’t turn the

ball over.”

Midway through the ﬁrst half, the
Generals switched up their defense to
a 1-3-1 zone and, after the 13:18 mark,
Randolph-Macon shot six of 18 from
the ﬁeld.

“They were having a real off night
from outside and the zone really ex-
ploited that,” said Cimino. “We have so
many long, athletic guys which makes
the zone much more effective.”

In the second half, Adkins once again
began the scoring for the Generals, but
then W&L’s shooting cooled off and
the team was unable to hit another shot
from the ﬁeld for nearly 1 1 minutes. The
Yellow Jackets capitalized off of the
poor shooting and went on a 17-6 run
to deadlock the score at 47-47 with 8:07
remaining. W&L and Randolph-Macon
then traded off free throws and the score
stayed tied at 49-49.

When the Blue and White needed a
basket the most, it was Goetsch, one of
the team’s senior captains, who ended
the Generals’ drought from the ﬁeld on a
three-pointer from the left wing and a la-
yup off of a feed from Ey. Goetsch said
the key to not falling behind was playing
with a high intensity level.

“Before the game, we had talked
about keeping up our intensity for the
whole game,” said Goetsch who tied a
game-high in scoring with 17. “No mat-
ter what the score was, we were not sur-
prised or fazed that the game got close
in the second half.”

Cimino extended the lead to 56-49
with 5:22 to go on a layup after grabbing
an offensive rebound. Randolph-Macon

_ converted a layup of its own on the fol-

lowing possession but was never able to
get any closer down the stretch, the ﬁnal
score being 65-57. ,

In the effort, the Generals shot 44.7
percent from the ﬁeld and held the Yel-
low Jackets to 37.7 percent shooting, in-
cluding one of 23 from beyond the arc.
During the scoring drought, W&L was
aided by excellent foul shooting, con-
verting on 20 of 24 attempts. Also, the
team forced l7 turnovers for Randolph-
Macon and only had 12 of their own.

“We have been in some tough games
this season and over the last couple of
years,” said Coach Hutchinson after the
game. “We have responded quite well
to adversity all year long, and this game
was no different.”

Following the upset victory over

Randolph-Macon, the Generals trav-
elled to Randolph College on Saturday.

The game started out as a defensive
battle as both teams struggled to score.
The score was 24-20 at the break. The
game remained tight for the ﬁrst eight
minutes of the second stanza, but the
Generals eventually broke the game
open. The score was 36-34 before W&L
went on a 13-3 run, making the score
49-37. Adkins punctuated the lead with
a three-pointer oﬁf a steal with 6:44 to
go.
Randolph narrowed the deﬁcit to
eight points, but could not get any clos-
er. From the 5:24 mark on, the Generals
scored 15 of the game’s next 20 points
to win 64-46.

Cimino, Goetsch and White each had
11 points apiece in the contest, while
ﬁrst-year Hans Harris contributed nine
points off the bench. Once again, the
Generals minimized turnovers by com-
mitting only nine, while forcing 17 by
the Wildcats.

The W&L men’s basketball team is
now 12-6 overall and 4-5 in the Old Do-
minion Athletic Conference.

Saintsvs. Colts: What’s the key to victory?

Expect high-scoring and an emphasis on the receiving corps from two virtually identical offensive teams in Superbowl XLI V

By Adam cancryn
STAFF WRITER

And so it is set. Super Bowl XLIV
will pit the Indianapolis Colts against
the New Orleans Saints. Manning vs.
Brees. Offense vs. offense. First one to
40 wins.

In the days leading up to the game,
every aspect of these two teams_will in-
evitably be examined, pored over and
picked at in search of some obscure clue
as to who will have the upper hand. Of-
fenses will be compared to defenses,
players matched up against their posi-
tional counterparts and coaching strate-
gies scrutinized. ‘

Countless storylines will emerge, but
perhaps the most compelling one is also
the simplest: the Saints and the Colts are
nearly identical in every way.

It is no secret that Indianapolis’ path
to victory is paved through the air. The
team averaged more than 282 yards per
game through the air, good enough for
second among all teams. Oftheir 14 vic-
tories, star QB Peyton Manning threw
for at least 300 yards nine times. He
completed touchdown passes to ﬁve dif-

ferent receivers, and wide receiver Reg-
gie Wayne and tight end Dallas Clark
each notched 100 receptions.

The only team more committed to
passing, it seems, is the Saints. Employ-
ing a similar aerial attack, New Orleans
equaled the Colts’ 34 passing scores and
supplemented it with 11 completions of
40+ yards.

They boast their own accomplished
signal caller, Drew Brees. Cast off
by the Chargers ﬁve years ago, Brees
moved to post-Katrina Louisiana and
promptly ignited the offense. His deadly
accuracy put him atop all quarterbacks

this year in completion percentage and

passer rating. v
Both have dispelled the notion that to
win in the NFL you must run the ball.
The Colts have perhaps the worst run-
ning game in the league. Veteran Joseph
Addai and newcomer Donald Brown
combined forjust 1,294 yards, a league
low. But it’s not like they had much ofa
chance to establish their worth: the Colts
averaged just 22.9 rushing attempts a

game. By comparison, their last playoff
opponent, the Jets, ran almost 40 times
each week. ‘

New Orleans possesses a stable of
running backs, but they are just as much
receivers as runners. Pierre Thomas
and Reggie Bush combined to make
86 catches out of the backﬁeld. The run
game is used primarily as a strategic
change of pace, something to break up
the monotony of Brees’ throws. For just
the second time in 20 years, both Super
Bowl teams are without a 1,000-yard
rusher.

If the Saints and Colts have merely
ignored the run game, then they’ve
demonstrated disgust at the concept of
defense. The two are the only playoff
teams ranked in the bottom 15 in total
defense, giving up more than 339 yards
per game. The Colts’ run defense was a
sieve, with opponents averaging nearly
127 yards on the ground. The Saints’ de-
ﬁciencies came in the secondary, which
ranked 26th against the pass.

The ﬁnal score of this Super Bowl

 
 

 

 
 

  @Mi
 @Arizo

V l/.DCtff1.l1Ii:@T§¥ii}éSS€

 

will certainly not be 9-6.

So what will determine the outcome
of a matchup of two identical teams?
Unsurprisingly, it will likely come down
to the play of two similar groups: the
receiving corps. Indianapolis and New
Orleans have found success through the
air by relying on previously unheralded
receivers; players that, when turned
loose in a pass-centric environment,
have flourished.

To win, the Saints’ trio of Marques
Colsten, Devery Henderson and Robert
Meachem must be the ones to move the
ball down the ﬁeld.

With defenders keying on Pro Bowl-
ers Wayne and Clark, the Colts will need
to look to previous unknowns Pierre
Garcon and Austin Collie.

If you don’t immediately recognize
those names, don’t worry; most scouts
hadn’t either when they broke into the
league. In fact, Meachem was the only
one selected in the ﬁrst round of his re-
spective draft, as the 27th pick. The av-
erage draft position for the other four is

158.

This year, however, they have made a
name for themselves. Collie emerged as
a reliable receiver opposite Wayne after
the Colts lost a starter early in the sea-
son. He made headlines most recently
after catching seven balls for 123 yards
in the AFC championship, including
a game-changing 46-yard touchdown.
Garcon, who did not start a game last
year, has become Manning’s go-to guy
in the playoffs. He leads Indianapolis
with 16 receptions.

Compared to the Colts’ young ﬂy-
ers, Colston, Henderson and Meachem
are seasoned veterans. The unit has de-
veloped a chemistry with Brees that is
rarely disrupted.

The pieces are in place for a display
of offensive ﬁreworks not normally seen
on Super Bowl Sunday. The only ques-
tions that remain are how many points
each team can score and which group
of unheralded receivers will swing the
game in their favor.

Sophomore forward Becca‘Bolton goes up for a lay-up in the Generals’ 69-66 win over Guilford College on
Friday. Bolton put up a career-high 31 points and 13 rebounds for her ninth double-double of the season

Women on the rise

The Lady Generals continue their success with a 69-66 win over Guilford College

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

Sophomore forward Becca Bolton out-
did herself again, and Washington and Lee
beat Guilford College 69-66 in a back and
forth battle on Friday night.

W&L stretched its winning streak to
four games and ran their record to 9-7
overall and a sparkling 8-4 conference re-
cord with the win. The Quakers beat the
Generals 55-52 on December 2nd, but the
tables were turned this time around.

It took a while for both offenses to get
going and the ﬁrst half ended all tied up at
26-26. Lead changes were plentiful in the
ﬁrst stanza as both teams struggled to seize
control of the game. Once the second half
started though, the ﬁreworks began. Head
coach Mandy King must have said all the
right things at half time, because the Gen-
erals came ﬂying out of the gate and went
on a 17-3 run.

The ﬁrst seven minutes of the second
half was all W&L. The defense forced six
Guilford turnovers during that span and
the Generals’ offense capitalized on their
miscues. With 13 minutes left, W&L had a
comfortable 43-29 lead. But Guilford was
not going down without a ﬁght. With 47
seconds left, Jazlyn Gibbs sunk two free
throws for the Quakers to put Guilford
ahead by a score of 66-65.

Fundamentals won this game for W&L.
Bolton knocked down a free throw to tie
the game at 66-66 with 33 seconds left.
F irst-year Katy Wilson drew a foul and
made one of two shots at the charity stripe
to put the Generals ahead. And Bolton iced
the game by grabbing a rebound, drawing
afoul and sinking two more free throws
with a mere four seconds left on the clock,
ensuring the 69-66 victory.

Bolton, who has been a double-double
machine as of late, continued that trend
with her ninth double-digit point and re-
bound performance of the year. Bolton
ﬁnished the game with 31 points and 13
rebounds. She was extremely efﬁcient in
this game, making 10 of 12 ﬁeld goal at-
tempts and sinking all ll free throws.

‘ For the game, the Generals shot 89 per-
cent for free throws (24-27) to make up
for a dismal shooting performance from
long range. Fundamentals outweighed
ﬂair in this contest as the near-plerfect free

throw shooting exhibition made it easy
to overlook a poor 15 percent three-point
ﬁeld goal performance.

“It was a great team effort,” said junior
forward Felice Herman, who added 14
points and ﬁve rebounds to the win. “The
individual efforts were complimented per-
fectly by our chemistry on the ﬂoor. That
whole game was about revenge for the
loss the ﬁrst time. Even though we did not
match up great with Guilford, we_got the
stops we needed on defense and made the
shots that counted on offense.” .

As postseason play advances rapidly,

W&L is coming together at just the right
time. The team faces another tough test on
Tuesday and put their winning streak on
the line versus Virginia Wesleyan.

Herman said she is already looking for-
ward to the next challenge.

“We know we have to be just as tough
when playing against Wesleyan,” she said.
“That will be another great challenge for
us and will just be another opportunity for
revenge for the one-point loss to them last
time.”

That contest will tip offat 7 p.m. at Vir-
ginia Wesleyan.
