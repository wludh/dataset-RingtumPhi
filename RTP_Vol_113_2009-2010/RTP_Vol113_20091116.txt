1897

VOLUME CXIII, NUMBER 8

Generals
support soldiers

Student atheletes assemble
care packages for men

serving overseas

By Kirsten Kyne
STAFF WRITER

On Friday, November 13, members from every
varsity sports team at Washington and Lee gathered
in Warner Athletic Complex to assemble 486 care
packages to send to the members of the Black Hawk
Battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division in Afghani-
stan. .

This event was organized by the Student Athlete
Advisory Committee, commonly known as SAAC.
This service project has been happening every year
for the past three years and according to senior Sal-
lie Armstrong, this year was “as smooth as it’s ever
been,” despite the increase in packages being sent to
Afghanistan from around 200 in previous years.

In order to make this project possible, each sports
team was assigned a certain item to collect. Items in-
cluded toothpaste, toothbrushes, magazines, candy,
crackers, and instant drink powders. Each team had
a different strategy for collecting their items. Some
teams had each athlete bring in a certain number of
their particular item while others collected money
and had one player purchase their items in bulk.

“I was in charge of collecting the toothpaste from
the ﬁeld hockey team and making sure each girl
brought in their ﬁve toothpastes,” junior Kate Don-
nelly said. “I also had to make sure that everyone
from the team came today to help ﬁll the boxes.”

Athletes were excited to participate in this fun
event.

“It’s good to do. Everyone needs a morale boost-
er some time,” senior Caroline Habliston said.

Freshman Alex Hamill helped collect Twinkies
and Hostess cakes to send in the boxes with her la-
crosse team. Hamill expressed that collecting the
snacks was just a small way to thank the soldiers.

“It’s good to give back to the soldiers who are
sacriﬁcing so much for us and to thank them,” she
said.

Many athletes also enjoyed writing the handwrit-
ten letters to place in each of the boxes.

“I would try to write about current events or ev-
eryday things to just give them a break from what’s
going on over there,” Habliston said.

Every athlete would put together at least one care
package and place a handwritten letter to each of the
soldiers. The letters could be about anything and
some even used their artistic abilities to try to bright-
en the servicemen and women’s days.

Athletic Director Jan Hathom said she was proud
of the athletes at W&L.

“It’s fabulous. Any time we can think about
things greater than us, it’s a great thing,” she said.
“It helps put things in perspective. It lets us know
that there’s something bigger than us going on.”

Hathom feels that the athletes at W&L are so will-
ing to participate in activities like the SAAC Care
Packages because they have a sense of teamwork.

“We’re all just one giant team, metaphorically
speaking,” she said. “We support each other and are
willing to help others.”

Not only did athletes participate in this event,
but the Lexington community joined in to make this
year the most successful yet.

“We got a lot of money and many donations,”
said Armstrong.

Many community members came on Friday to
help assemble the boxes and, according to Arm-
strong, “we ﬁnished early because we had so much
help.”

Some faculty members even joined in for the
cause. Thomas Bane, known as “Baner” to students,
donated 486 copies of his book, Family and Honor,
to SAAC to be included in the package. This will
help show the soldiers the importance of honor at
our institution and how athletes are so appreciative
of what the soldiers are sacriﬁcing.

The care packages are expected to be sent later
this week and should arrive in Afghanistan at the end
of November. “I think [the care packages] will be a
little bit of excitement for the soldiers,” Habliston
said. “I hope it will brighten their days a little bit.”

W&L can expect to see more things from SAAC
in the future. .

“We’re trying to organize an Athletes’ Formal in
the spring and have better communication between
teams and the faculty,” said Donnelly. “Every year
we try to incorporate athletics with service.”

SAAC also plans to coordinate more service
events.

“I think [the athletes] are excited to help outand
are always excited to unite,” said Donnelly. “These
projects create opportunities to meet people from
other teams.”

Recent spike in HIN] virus hits

Rockbridge County High School and
W&L with a record number of cases

By Jessica Strait
STAFF WRITER

As swine ﬂu continues to remain
a threat on Washington and Lee’s
campus and the number of cases rise,
Rockbridge County High School re-
cently experienced an outbreak of
the HlNl virus that has resulted in a
large number of student absences.

RCHS Nurse Karen Tolley said
she usually sees an average 25 to 30
students per week in her ofﬁce, but
lately the number has increased to
closer to 50. During the week of Oc-
tober 12 to 16, Tolley saw 220 stu-
dents of the school’s approximately
1032 total students, and 95 were sent
home. An increase in swine ﬂu cases
has also been observed in RCHS
teachers. Tolley said she treats any
presence of ﬂu symptoms in students
as swine ﬂu, instead of speciﬁcally
testing for the HlNl virus. Students
typically stay home for a few days
after diagnosis.

“We follow the Center for Dis-
ease Control protocol, but we go one
step further,” Tolley said. “If there is
diarrhea or throwing up, we ask that
the student be symptom-free from
that for 24 hours before returning to
school.”

Although Tolley said the numbers
have now leveled off almost back
to normal, she expects HlNl to hit
again, harder, closer to the regular
ﬂu season, which usually peaks in
November and lasts until March or
April. But Tolley said RCHS is pre-
pared for the virus.’

“We’re getting vaccines by next

week and have already treated grade
schools in the Rockbridge County
area,” said Tolley.

Tolley said she would like the
high school to have sanitation sta-
tions, but that RCHS currently does
not have any signiﬁcant swine ﬂu
prevention measures in place.

W&L is a different storynumer-
ous sanitation stations, hand-wash-
ing reminders, “ﬂu buddy” posters
and swine ﬂu prevention tips can be
seen around campus, all part of the
“aggressive communications plan”
designed to alert‘. students and the
community to the threat of swine ﬂu.
To date, there have been a total of 78
recorded cases of swine ﬂu on cam-
pus since Aug. 29.

Dr. Jane Horton, MD., Director '

of Student Health and Counseling at
W&L, said the prevalence of swine
ﬂu at W&L is what she expected,
and is comparable to other small,
residential campuses. The average
weekly attack rate was similar to
the national rate up until the ‘week
of Oct. 31 to Nov. 6, when 17 cases
were recorded on campus.

“We have seen an increase in cas-
es of inﬂuenza-like illness,” Horton
said. “We need to reinforce both pre-
ventative measures and encourage
people who are sick to stay home to
avoid spreading the illness.”

On Nov. 9, students received an e-
mail from Dean Watkins, Vice Presi-
dent of Student Affairs and Dean of
Students, acknowledging that the

week of October 3 1 brought the high-
est number of cases in a single week
since classes began. Watkins asked
employees to self-report illnesses,
encouraged University members to
get the vaccine if they can ﬁnd it and
reminded members of the commu-
nity of basic preventative measures,
like washing hands often, avoiding
close contact with sick people and
covering your nose or mouth with a
tissue when you cough or sneeze.

Like RCHS, the Health Center is
not testing for swine ﬂu, and instead
presumes that any “inﬂuenza-like ill-
ness” is swine ﬂu, becauseiaccording
to the Centers for Disease Control,
HlNl is the only strain currently cir-
culating in the U.S. A few inﬂuenza
A tests have been done to make sure
inﬂuenza is in fact what the Health
Center is dealing with, but for the
most part, the doctors are diagnos-
ing and treating students without any
testing.

And like Tolley, Horton believes
the worst is yet to come, predict-
ing more inﬂuenza-like illness this
winter than usual due to both the
HlNl and seasonal ﬂu strains that
will be circulating. Dr. Horton en-
courages students to get both a sea-
sonal ﬂu vaccine and the H1Nl ﬂu
vaccine. The Student Health Center
is out of the seasonal ﬂu vaccine, so
Horton said students should check
with personal physicians at home
over Thanksgiving break for vac-
cine availability. Each individual

 

student’s decision to receive a vac-
cination now will make a big differ-
ence come ﬂu season time, because
“the more of the population that is
immunized, the less likely we are
to have a big outbreak this winter,”
Horton said.

Horton said an “ample supply” of
the H1N1 vaccine for students and
at-risk faculty and staff in both the
nasal mist and injectable fonn has
been ordered but not yet received.
Other campus health centers have
begun to receive vaccines in small
allotments, so Horton expects W&L
to soon receive at least a fraction of
the ordered vaccinations.

Students will be notiﬁed via cam-
pus notices when the HlN1 vaccine
is available on campus. Any students
with an underlying medical condition
that increases their risk for swine ﬂu
will receive an e-mail and be made
a top priority for the initial supply
of HlNl vaccines. Healthy students
are encouraged to take the nasal mist
form of the vaccine, which will be
more common.

An outbreak of swine ﬂu ﬁrst hit
W&L last April. Information about
swine ﬂu and an up-to-date chart
keeping track of cases on campus

Travel|er’s new code of conduct

Misbehavior and disrespect no longer tolerated; new rules enforced for safety of all

By Lizz Dye
s TA F F w R I T E R

On Saturday night bodies cram
into Traveller, all vying for a ride
back to Red Square or the Quad.
After the night’s festivities, drunken
shouts and slurred’ words sound off
in the cab of the bus, and sometimes
in the cacophony, individuals get out
of hand—yelling profanities, shout-
ing at drivers and even tossing the
stray beer in the face of a Traveller
monitor. However, in light of recent
events, certain changes have been
put in play.

Katie Boiles, chair of the Travel-
ler System, discussed the new “Trav-
eller Conduct System”, which she
and all of the other Traveller drivers
hope will improve the current situa-
tion. The Traveller employees actu-

I ally created a public relations com-

mittee for Traveller right before the
recent accident involving a student
because they realized there were
changes in behavior that needed to
be addressed.

This new system’s purpose is to
“create a system of accountability
for students whose conduct with the
Traveller System is not consistent
with the values of the university,”
and will be implemented during
the ﬁrst week of operations of Win-
ter Term. Boiles said that it should
“encourage people to model their
behavior in an appropriate way” and
that there should be consequences
for actions.

The system is deﬁned by a se-
ries of sanctions that any Traveller
employee can issue. A ﬁrst sanction
is a $25 ﬁne, a second sanction is a

$50 ﬁne, and a third sanction means
that the offender is suspended from
the Traveller System for the entire
semester. Any behavior that seems
particularly egregious may be for-
warded to the SJC for particular ac-
tion.

A lot of behavior that has been
sliding by will no longer be toler-
ated on Traveller. Some rules that
will be particularly enforced include
no"alcohol or unsealed beverages
on Traveller and treating Traveller
employees with respect. Refusal to
comply when asked to exit an over-
loaded van or bus, verbal abuse of
Traveller employees (drivers, moni-
tors and dispatchers), and pushing
and shoving that causes harm to
other passengers could all result in
disciplinary action.

A lot of the inappropriate behav-
ior that has occurred is also extreme-
ly harmful and can result in acci-
dents like the one that occurred this
year. This new system will prevent
accidents like this from occurring
and will aim to make Traveller stops
a more peaceful and pleasant place.

Boiles is particularly excited
about installing corral systems at
the Pole Houses and Windfall, and
eventually the Cabins and Kappa
Hill. The system will act like a corral
system for cattle, so that “the mob”
waiting for Traveller does not rush
the bus due to not having a designat-

ed line. This was suggested by the ~

Traveller drivers, who display their
anxiety about pushing, shoving and
crowding from inebriated students

who are clearly behaving more like
cattle than people.

Boiles also wanted to remind
students that if they are on Travel-
ler and a driver asks them their name
and they falsely identify themselves,
it will be treated as an honor viola-
tion.

More changes may soon be com-
ing as well. Next year, the Traveller
system may require students to show
their W&L student IDs when they

' get on the bus so drivers can identify

students who are misbehaving, such
as students throwing beer in moni-
tors’ faces while waiting for Travel-
ler. This potential new measure is
not meant to implicate students who
are under 21 and drinking.

Between now and winter break,
there will be signs around campus
detailing the new “Traveller Con-
duct System.” Megan Steinhardt and
Director of Health and Promotion
Jane Kaufman have designed “Toilet
Time with Traveller,” which students
will be able to view all over campus
while doing their business.

Boiles and the rest of the Travel-
ler team hope that these new sanc-
tions will not only act as a wake up
call for those who choose to disre-
gard basic courtesy, but also make
the Traveller system safe for all who
participate in it—whether it be driv-
ing, monitoring or getting that late
night ride back from the country.

The bestof the Internet: procrastinating in college

Have a paper to write tonight, but don ’t really want to write it? Jonathan Salm outlines your procrastination future.

By Jonathan Salm
c o LU M N I sr

It’s Sunday night. You have
a six-page paper on God knows
what due in the morning and it
is rapidly approaching 11 p.m.
After wasting about an hour in
the co—op eating and talking to
whoever will listen, you ﬁnally
decide to get serious and head to
the library.

Resisting the urge to talk to

' anyone on the main ﬂoor, you

head down into the depths of
Leyburn, open up your laptop,
and begin—or so you plan.

Before opening up Microsoft
Word, you decide to click on that
alluring fox wrapped around the
globe, the striking ‘e’ symbol
or the tempting compass. And
for you cool kids, you open up
Google Chrome or Opera. And
then it begins~—not the paper,
but the long, oﬂen tranquil pro-
cess of procrastination. I would
know—-I do this on a weekly
basis and consider myself an ex-
pert authority on the art that is
procrastination. If you continue
reading, you might become one,
too.

The ﬁrst stop on the Internet
for procrastinators is social net-
working sites. Facebook has be-

come the overwhehning‘ favorite, . ’

but kudos to those who still stick
with Myspace, despite its obvi-
ous inferiority. Check some no-
tiﬁcations, write on some walls,
lurk on some proﬁles or pictures,
and bam—there go thirty min-
utes.

Pro tip: leave Facebook up
when you ﬁnally do begin writ-
ing that paper. In the middle of
an especially arduous paragraph,
expect to be rescued by Face-
book’s dreamy ‘pop’ sound, sig-
nifying a new instant message.
You get anywhere from two min-
utes to a full hour of procrastina-
tion time from this.

After checking statuses, friend
requests and the like, it’s time for
some music, beyond what is al‘-
ready playing on iTunes. (It’s a
given that any college student
with a laptop has iTunes running
at all times). So you head to Pan-
dora.com, a music recommenda-
tion site birthed out of the futur-
istic Music Genome Project.

The listener puts in a song
or artist, and Pandora spits out
a variety of tunes that matches
the original based upon over 400
“musical attributes” as coded by
the Music Genome Project. Pan-
dora is a great way to discover
new music and an even greater
way to waste time.

If Pandora helps you discover
that certain sound that you’ve
been searching for since forever,
or if you just HAVE to listen to
every song Nickelback has ever
written (just kidding, I assume
that most W&L students have
more sophisticated taste in mu-
sic than that), head on over to
imeem.com.

Think of imeem as a better,
free version of the iTunes store.

THE MEDIA BOARD

Although it is completely free,
unlike iTunes, you still can’t pur-
chase any of the songs from the
site itself. However, imeem does
offer streaming tunes from all
four major labels, and the ability
to create and publish playlists,
similar to iTunes’ iMix feature.
If you know exactly what you’re
looking for, imeem reigns su-
preme.

After music, why not go for
movies or TV shows? YouTube
is the obvious choice here, but
it is hindered by an overﬂow of
stupidity that serves to demon-
strate how unintelligent the hu-
man race truly is. Case study:
“Leave Britney Alone.”

If you know what you want,
YouTube is great. Otherwise, I
should warn you, prepare to have
your intelligence lowered, which
could adversely affect that paper
you should be writing. Remem-
ber, the one due in fewer than ten
hours?

As an alternative to YouTube,
I suggest Hulu. While there are
a variety of borderline-legal sites
streaming both movies and TV
shows that somehow manage to
remain active, they all pale in
comparison.

Started in 2007 with the over-
ly quixotic vision of streaming
high quality TV shows and mov-
ies from major networks and stu-
dios, Hulu has in fact done just
that. Currently, NBC Universal,
Fox Entertainment Group and

ABC are partners. Go to Hulu to
catch up on favorites you missed
this week or to discover some-
thing brand new.

So far, about three to four
hours of time have been wasted
if you have effectively visited
each previously mentioned site.
Care for more? Check out FMy-
Life (FML), MyLifeIsAverage
(MLIA), and Texts From Last
Night (TFLN).

Here’s the deal. I absolutely
hate each one of these sites with
umnatched passion and anger.
Sure, they might be insanely pop-
ular with teenagers and college
students alike, but after brows-
ing each one for about a minute
apiece, I always want to puke.
Oh really—exam in an hour!!
OMG haven’t started studying
yeti! FMLII A more appropriate
FML would be something like,
“Living in Darfur. Might die to-
day. We’ll see. FML.”

While each post might in-
volve a mildly uncomfortable
event resulting in some hardship,
it’s hard to see any of these posts’
authors being in a situation where
their lives are truly f%#$ed.

MLIA acts as the opposite
of FML, but that doesn’t mean
it’s any less nauseating. TFLN
is even worse. The stupidity of
these texts posted online makes
me embarrassed to even own a
phone. Ranging from wtf-worth-
ly sexual encounters to boastful
claims of inhumane drinking,

TFLN culls together the worst
part of college and young adult
life and slaps it together on a
webpage.

If a trio of the worst sites,
popular and procrastination-won
thy nonetheless, can be compared
with a trio of the best sites, take
the three above in consideration
with Digg, Stumbleupon and the
true king: Wikipedia. These three
are examples of Web 2.0—sites
that thrive on interconnectivity,
information sharing, and user
generated content.

Digg collates the most inter-
esting and newsworthy articles
as voted upon by the site’s users.
Thriving on the interconnectivity
of Web 2.0, users “digg” articles
from around the web, and the
articles with the most diggs get
face time on the dz'gg.com front
page.

Stumbleupon works as a
more concise, directed version
of digg-—users select their in-
terests, click “stumble” and are
serendipitously directed to pages
that interest them. For example,
since I selected satire as an in-
terest, I stumbled upon a blog
post about “Customer Service
Calls to God.” Stumbleupon
also allows users to “like” cer-
tain pages and share them with
friends via Facebook, email, etc.
Hours upon hours can be wasted
on both Digg and Stumbleupon,
but neither can match the true
procrastinating powers of Wiki-

pedia.

Go to Wikipedia, right now, I
dare you. Click on a random link.
Read that page. Click a link on
that page to another Wikipedia
article. Repeat. Great, see you in
an hour.

Wikipedia has the power to
suck out the productivity of the
most productive men on the plan-
et. Wikipedia has such a mass of
information that any literate per-
son is bound to ﬁnd something
that interests them, which is why
in my procrastination expertise,
can I call Wikipedia the true king
of procrastination.

Now, if you ﬁnd yourself in
the unfortunate Sunday night
paper situation, follow my ad-
vice: just relax a little, boot up
your favorite Internet browser
and run wild. The Internet is to
some a time-sink, and to others a
boundless source of knowledge,
media and social interaction. If
you can’t tell, I follow the latter
philosophy.

If anything, procrastination
has expanded my mind and im-
proved my life, which is more I
can say for my last few Sunday
night papers.

Little concern for human rights

Obama administration has a long way to go to fulﬁll human rights promises

By Abel Delgado
c 0 Lu M N I s T

What did November 9th
mean to you?

To me, it meant the com-
memoration of the day the Ber-
lin Wall came crashing down at
the hands of a people yearning to
be reunited. It meant the proof of
democracy over Communism, of
human rights over oppression, of
the rights of the people over the
will of the state.

It also marked the further vin-
dication of great men like Ronald
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.
Together, they brought about the
circumstances that allowed for
the destruction of that horriﬁc
physical and symbolic wall that
long separated families and still
separates mine. November 9th
means so much to me that I have
piece of that wall, marking the
date the world changed, on my
desk. «
Apparently, it does not mean
nearly as much to President
Obama, our Nobel Peace Prize-
winning leader of the free world.
He gladly stopped by the city. of

Berlin, Germany to campaign
for president in front of people
who couldn’t even vote, but not
to honor the twentieth anniver-
sary of one of the most singular-
ly deﬁning global events of the
twentieth century.

We should not be terribly sur-
prised.

Wall Street Journal Foreign
Correspondent Bret Stephens re-
cently took President Obama to
task for this decision and for the
Obama Administration’s utterly
disheartening record on human
rights issues.

One would assume President
Obama would be tea buddies
with the Dalai Lama. Wrong.
The President has refused to
meet with the digniﬁed defender
of Tibet.

One would assume President
Obama would at least attempt
to follow his campaign rheto-
ric in regards to the genocidal
government of Sudan of apply-
ing pressure. Wrong. Darfurian
rights activists must be asking

themselves, “What pressure?”
Washington and Lee students
who attended “Showcase for Su-
dan” already have shown more
concern for Sudanese refugees
than Obama’s top administration
members.

One would assume the so-
cial network-loving Obama staff
would be ﬁlled with glee over
what happened in Iran this sum-
mer. /If they were, they sure did
an excellent job of hiding it.

One would assume a presi-
dent who spoke so forcefully of
applying the will of the Ameri-
can people would not forget the
will of the Russian, Cuban and
Chinese citizens who are be-
ing murdered and tortured at
the hands of government thugs.
Wrong.

The Obama administration_

would not want silly things, like
human dignity to get in the way
of China bankrolling the farce
of an economic recovery. They
could care less about those who
get tortured 90 miles away. Fur-

‘ 'cowardice—to

thermore, Obama’s team does not
seem to think what Russia does
with its people and its neighbors
is any of our business.

But the administration’s be-
lief that human rights concerns
get in the way of solving other
problems is most troubling.

In his article, Stephens wrote,
“It also takes a remarkable de-
gree of cynicism—or perhaps
treat human
rights as something that ‘inter-
feres’ with America’s purposes
in the world, rather than as the
very thing that ought to deﬁne
them.”

Maybe it’s a good thing
President Obama did not tarnish
Berlin with a hypocritical visit.
Maybe he simply realized he
didn’t belong there.

Maybe we should start ex-
pecting more concern for human
rights issues out of not just Pres-
ident Obama, but everyone who
serves our country.

Environmental policy hurts the poor

Washington and Lee is project of environmental sustanabilizy is
hurting the more disadvantaged students on campus

By Dane Davls
COLUMNIST

In the beginning of this year,
a new policy was announced in
order to further our campus goal
of decreased carbon emissions
and increased environmental sus-
tainability. The temperature lev-
els of all campus buildings were
changed.

In the summer, buildings are
now not allowed to get cooler than
74 degrees Fahrenheit. Likewise,
in the winter the thermostat can-
not be raised to any temperature
higher than 68 degrees. By keep-
ing buildings cool in the winter
and wann in the summer, it was
thought that energy consumption
would decrease, having the twin
effects of lowering costs incurred
by the school and decreasing car-
bon emissions.

I do not doubt that this policy
will accomplish both of the stat-
ed goals. Nor do I doubt the good
intentions of those who made this
policy change.

However, I do contest the val-
ue of said policy considering cur-
rent economic conditions and its
effect upon the poor. Allow me to
explain. , . ,.

It is quite clear that the Amer-
ican economy is in a period of
recession, resulting in stagnant
wages and high unemployment
levels. During this time, the most
disadvantaged among us suffer
the greatest, as they face higher
levels of job insecurity in addi-

tion to lower levels of income. It _

is during times like these that our
vigilance for the poor, so nobly
displayed by our record of vol-
unteering in the Campus Kitchen
program and the Shepherd Pov-
erty Program, which must be at
its highest. Winter is especially
difficult for the working poor, as
they must spend high portions of
their incomes on heating bills.
Now, it is a brutal but nec-
essary truth that some of our

students come from such condi-
tions. Although I count myself
among the fortunate, not all are.
As such, in order to maintain the
same levels of comfort as before
the temperature switch, students
must purchase more sweaters,
scarves and other articles of win-
ter clothing.

While richer students can eas-
ily afford these new purchases,
poorer students may be forced to
choose between staying warm or
some other necessary purchase.

Reducing costs is a noble
goal, but there are other areas

that our university could begin.

cutting costs before they mandate
temperature reductions.

Observe how much the univer-
sity spends on landscaping alone.
Take for instance the sodding
of the grass by the Elrod Com-
mons before Parent’s Weekend.
Was this really necessary? What
of the Git-Er-Done campaign by

the registrar that was rumored to

cost around $10,000 for licensing

fees? Again, is this necessary?
While this issue may seem

" trivial, it is not. The university is

in effect cost shiﬁing the price of
heating onto students. As a result,
students have noticed the colder
classrooms. One can only esti-
mate as to what effect this will
have on classroom performance.
Can we really expect students to
be engaged in class while their
minds are focused on keeping

, warm?

Before winter gets any colder,
the university should end its pol-
icy of keeping the heater down
during winter. If the university
believes in both the necessity and
wisdom of its policy, it should
seek student ratiﬁcation and pop-
ular consent in some form.

OPINIONS EDITOR ‘

You know it’s not easy be-
ing a dangerous and. innovative
writer.

Sometimes you have to take
risks, even when you know peo-

V ple are going to get mad at you
- about what you write. But you

I don’t care who I piss off, that
High Deﬁnition television is re-
ally, really good.

I realize that you are probably
shaking your head right now, and
you might be drafting a strongly

- worded letter to President Rus-

. cio, but just hear me out. High

Deﬁnition television is so good
by now that it is detrimental to
your life not to have it. Seriously.
I would say that this is the great-
est invention since sliced bread,
but sliced bread seems to pale in
comparison to High Deﬁnition.
Let’s start with sports. After
High Deﬁnition enters your life,
sports themselves are no longer

the same.

Sundays are no longer work
days that are used to get over
hangovers. Instead, your hang-
over is now coddled with foot-
ball. No longer are you left won-
dering if that guy in the middle
of the ﬁeld is the referee or just

signiﬁcantly improved by the
advent of High Deﬁnition televi-
sion. Lax bros can now properly
tell whether the -Hopkins attack-
man has an appropriate amount
of lettuce ﬂowing from the back
of his helmet. Baseball fans can
now tell which of their favorite

consist of “wondering whether
that girl seated inithe third row
of Fed Ex Field is single or not.
Thanks to High Deﬁnition Sun-
days, I have now become an‘
expert on all the different kinds
of specific ﬁeld turf. But foot-
ball isn’t the only sport that is

have to watch women’s tennis

maybe see a future for the NHL
that doesn’t involve bankruptcy.

Hell, even watching golf in High
Deﬁnition is almost as fun as it is
to play. Almost. You still might
need a Red Bull or three to get
through the back nine.‘

Movies are now made all
that much better thanks to High
Deﬁnition. This past week, my
roommate bought “Transformers
2” on Blu-Ray, which is the High
Deﬁnition form of DVD. Since I
am an East Coast elitist liberal,
I initially scoffed at his choice
in movie selection. I berated
him with jokes about Michael
Bay’s directing ability, which
is atrocious. However, after we
watched the movie, I was speech-
less. Was it as poorly made as I
always thought? Of course. But
thanks to Blu-Ray, I was able to
be placed right in the action as I
desperately ogled at Megan Fox
and saw giant machines tear each
other to pieces.

Girls, please take this High
Deﬁnition and Blu-Ray advice to
heart. It can come through in the
clutch, especially when you most

need it. Tired of having to sit
through your boyfriends’ “Lord
of the Rings” marathons while
he can’t get through ﬁve min-
utes of “Love Actually?” Well,
High Deﬁnition and Blu-Ray can
come to your rescue. You can
now invite any guy over, and I
guarantee that they will be able
to make it all the way through
“Failure to Launch” without
complaining once. As long as the
move is a Blu-Ray, the guy will
be so enthralled with the detail
of the landscape, that he will be
able to look past Sarah Jessica
Parker’s insufferable acting job.
You will be able to enjoy many
chick ﬂicks and maybe even a
“Sex and the City” marathon if
you simply make that minor in-
vestment in some kind of High
Deﬁnition.

High Deﬁnition has now be-
come fully a part of my life, and
if you just give it some time, it
will be fully a part of yours as
well. High Deﬁnition is to the
eyes what heroin is to the veins.

After one week of High Deﬁni-
tion, you will no longer be able
to watch cartoon shows in peace.
Seeing Cartman or Peter Grif-
ﬁn in High Deﬁnition is a com-
pletelydifferent experience from
watching them in standard deﬁ-
nition. Don’t believe me? Every
channel has made the expensive
switch to High Deﬁnition pro-
gramming because it is that prof-
itable. Even channels like Nick-
elodeon and Comedy Central are
doing this. Get the hint yet?

Look, I know that High Deﬁ-
nition doesn’t seem like it is that
much a necessity in your life. I
guess you need certain amenities
like food, water and education,
but this is High Deﬁnition we’re
talking about. You can always
beg for food and go to public
libraries. You can’t replace the
feeling of adding High Deﬁni-
tion to your life.

When we’re growing up, we
all want to be something. A doc-
tor, a ﬁreﬁghter, a veterinarian,
an astronaut. We want to be bal-

And that’s that.

As we’re growing up watch- I‘

ing these Disney princess movies,
no one ever really tells us what
happens after the fabled Princess

those dream jobs often don’t pay

As we move through our lives,
changes take place. We get hurt,

we hang with the “right crowd”
or the “wrong” one. Our parents
may or may not push us toward
academic or athletic success, and
we siﬁ our way through college
applications. And'jthen suddenly,
somewhere between sophomore
and junior yearfswe realize that
life is headed ourtway.

Maybe we change majors,
maybe we transfer schools. May-
be we stumble through a few
relationships before we realize
that soon we have to go out in
the world, make money, pay bills
and be adults. It’s a little scary to
think about because in front of us
looms so much possibility.

When we were young and so
sure of ourselves, it was easy to
think that everything would just
fall into place. Now, however,
we see that our choices really do
have consequences, and that tak-
ing one path leads us away from
others we thought we would
travel.

This is frightening because
there is so much to be had in front
of us, and at the same time, the

window of our childhood imagi-
nation, that universe of possibil-
ity, is slowly closing behind us.

The worst part is that we
are stuck, at this age and in this
era, between a desperate need
to prove ourselves and an over-
whelming desire not to let go of
the imagination we had when we
were younger.

When I applied to W&L, my
essay question asked, “What is
the best advice you’ve ever been
given?” I had to think about it for
a while, but the only answer that
ﬁt was one from my insane AP
English teacher ﬁom senior year
of high school. He simply said to
us, “Be passionate.” Whatever
you do, wherever you go, be pas-
sionate about the jobs you take,
the skills you cultivate and the
people you have in your life.

If I have learned anything
over my time here, it’s that with-
out the drive to succeed at some-
thing, you absolutely will not
ﬁnd success. Furthermore, you’ll
likely be pretty miserable in the
process, even if you’re one of

those people who can suck it up
and do work you don’t like, and
even those are rarities.

My best friend from home had
a baby this year and, somehow,
more power to her, she’s making
it work. She’s making it work as
a waitress and a line-cook. In a
situation that would send most

every sense of the word, I look at
my own fancy education and de-
pendent status, and wonder who
is truly more successful. She may
not be following the Disney fairy
tale template, but she’s vibrant,
happy and a wonderful mom to

so much to look forward to, and
so much for which to be grateful.
We’re healthy, intelligent and re-
ally have been provided with the
skill set to succeed in life, what-
ever that means.

That whole mess of crap that
life throws at us is what makes
this world worth living in. The
trials and tribulations, the wor-
ries and the wonder, all go hand
in hand. We can’t have one with-
out the other.

We wouldn’t appreciate the

Without passion, our motions

I know that I’m not the only one, I
hope that other women can read this and
realize that they’re not alone either. Ev-
ery now and then, when I get stressed
about school, sports or anything else,
this memory just keeps ﬁnding its way
back out. I’ve seen counselors, I’ve had
amazing friends, all of whom would
drop (and have dropped) anything to
comfort me.

I took a vacation to Montreal after
my senior year with my best friend from
high school, Beth, and we were planning
on spending some time with a mutual
friend’s brother. He joined us within 30
minutes of arriving at the hotel, which
I felt was a bit soon considering we
hadn’t even had a chance to look around
for ourselves yet. When I opened the ho-
tel room door, I discovered John, as well
as a second guy—Beth had asked John
to bring a “guy for her friend”.

We started pre gaming—having

‘some shots, beers and jagerbombs.

John’s friend, Graham, and I were just
having normal conversations, me teas-
ing him for being Canadian and so on.
I don’t think that I had more  

' drinks, but then again, I‘co1ildn’t7h(§l(¥

my liquor as well as I can now. So at the

" time, I didn’t suspect that anything was

going to happen.
Then, a few of the friends, Graham
included, went into Graham’s room to

smoke pot. He asked if I wanted to come,
and I said sure, but that I didn’t smoke
pot, which didn’t seem to be a problem
with him. In his room, I ended up taking
a hit for the ﬁrst time in my life. Shortly
afterwards, things started fading out.

My next memory is one that I will
never forget. I woke up naked with him
having sex with me. I was in a lot of
pain, and all I could say was “don’t.”

He either took that as “don’t stop”
or he chose to completely disregard my
comment, because he didn’t stop. He
asked if "I “liked that,” and I said no.
He then said, “That’s because it’s not in
your ass,” and he proceeded to switch
holes. At this point, I somehow found
the strength to throw him off of me, but
he just got right back and continued hav-
ing vaginal intercourse with me. Then I
blacked out again.

I woke up in the morning with his
arms around me.. We were both naked.

munity: If the only thing you remember
is trying to throw him off of you, it is not
consent. And I know that now. I cannot
change my past. I can only build on my
own experience. But an important point
to note is that my life has changed dra-
matically since this. I have yet to have
sex since. While I have DFM’ed (Dance
Floor Makeout, for all of the freshmen),
the idea of intercourse still scares me.

I was not a virgin when this happened,
but I’m still afraid that my next time will
bring up this memory.

Also, LOOK OUT FOR EACH
OTHER. I couldn’t believe that my best
friend just deserted me, and I was horri-
ﬁed to discover that she had witnessed
it——while sober——even when I had pre-
viously mentioned that I did not want
to have sex that night. Please, please,
PLEASE do not let this happen to any
girl. If you know that she does not want
to hook up with anyone, stop it from
happening, even if she’s not your best
friend.

If this has happened to you, please
know that you’re not alone. And wheth-
er or not this has happened, please
avoid from using the R word, even in a
ﬁiendly context. “We raped them in that
volleyball/basketball/soccer game” can
hit home for a lot more people than you
think——and you only notice when you
know that one of the victims is standing
with you. The problem is, 90 percent of
the time, you don’t know that “that girl
next to you” is one of them.

Momix shows innovation in dance

Worla'—renownea' dance group performs at W&L, teaches master class on the soul, joy of dancing from the heart

By Flndley Merrltt and Tory Kate Dlckerson

STAFF WRITERS

This past week, Washington
and Lee University was fortu-
nate enough to host the intema—
tionally-renowned dance group,
Momix, for a performance and
dance master class.

Momix is known for its imag-
inative illusions and surrealist
style. By using lights, props,
sculptures and puppets, to ‘name
just a few tricks, dancers send the
audience through a mind trip of
beautiful dancing and imagery.

The group is made up of
dancers from the likes of the
Tisch School of the Arts and The
Juilliard School and will be trav-

elling to Egypt for the next leg of
their tour.
Momix performed on

Wednesday night to a packed
house——the show was delayed
several minutes to ensure every-
one had a seat.

As a hush ﬁnally fell over the
crowd, the lights dimmed, and a
starry sky blanketed the stage as
an enormous glowing blue pup-
pet came out to send the audi-
ence oﬁ’ on its surreal journey.

The show was breathtaking,
and the audience could barely
contain itself as the stereotypi-
cal “ooh’s” and “ahh’s” slipped
from nearly everyone’s lips. The

group’s famous illusions pushed
the boundaries and limits of
imagination.

In one particular number, sev-
eral of the dancers donned white,
long sleeved shirts and stood
against a black backdrop. The
lighting effects allowed only the
sleeves to be seen and it looked
like a ﬂock of ﬂying birds. As the
dancers moved, they formed oth-
er shapes, and at one point even
mimicked moving lips,

Despite the astounding vi-
sual effects Momix is known
for, perhaps the most impressive
part of the show was the dancers’
strength, agility, technical skill
and work with props.

The third number into the
show, entitled “Tuu,” was a duet
with a man and a woman and no
props or i1lusions—just dancing.
Both dancers exhibited incred-
ible strength without sacriﬁcing
ﬂexibility. .

The man, Sam Beckman,
lifted dancer Rebecca Rasmus-
sen with ease. This number ex-
perimented with the symmetry
of two human bodies and weight
distribution. .

Another duet came later in the
show and incorporated a giant
metallic, curved statue. Beck-

Sculptures: I can’t

Simpson presents a dozen years ’worth

Sculptures aren’t just marble
and bronze. In fact, they can even
be made of butter.

Art History Professor Pamela

than 12 years of research in the

on Wednesday, including quotes
from a paper she wrote and im-
ages of various sculptures that she
has seen. '

While she has never done a
sculpture, Simpson appreciates
the art form.

She believes that butter sculp-
tures are intriguing because they
are made out of food. While peo-
ple do not eat the sculpture, it is
consumed mentally because it is
made out of a common foodstuff.

She says that in order to sculpt
with this medium, one has to
use a metal or wooden armature
to provide a base. Once the but-
ter is wrapped around the device
it needs to stay refrigerated for
many days to ensure that it will

eration. Also, regular butter is the
preferred medium, not margarine
because it is too sticky.

Senior Jane ‘Bouch attended the.

presentation and found Simpson’s
research to be very interesting.
“The size of some of the sculp-

_ tures was unreal. Most of the im-

ages that she showed were life-
size and very intricate,” Bouch
said.
Butter sculptures originated
.as centerpiece displays during
the Renaissance. The art medium
transformed into an advertising
technique for dairy farms in the
19th century and also represent-
ed an aspect of President Teddy
Roosevelt’s tenure in ofﬁce.
While an unusual art form, it is
something that is intriguing, inter-

Lomonte, rolled the enormous
statue along the stage while hold-

Tuesday.
Simerson taught the class,

company after his previous po-
sition with Eric Hawkins Dance
Company.

“I’d rather teach a class on performance rather than technique. It

not so choreographed comes out. Then you see individual personali-

ing on to it, thus being hoisted up
in the air giving the illusion of
ﬂying and suspension. The man-

uever, despite the bulky statue,‘

was both powerful and beautiful
to watch. _
Despite Momix’s awe—in-

spiring effects, the talent of the.

dancers cannot be mistaken for
an illusion. The ﬁnale gave each
dancer a short solo in the spot-
light to exhibit her personality
and talent. Even with the lack
of bright lights and nifty props,
it was one of the most incredible
pieces in the show.

While at W&L, member
Brian Simerson volunteered to
work with W&L dance students

emphasizing high energy, natu- I

ral movement and presentation
rather than perfection.

“I’d rather teach a class on
performance than on technique,”
said Simerson. “It gets people
out of their safety zones.”

The Virginia native has been
with Momix Dance Company
for 16 years, teaching classes
and performing as a soloist in the
company.

Under the directorship of
Moses Pendleton, Momix Dance
Company is known for present-
ing innovative work with excep-
tional physical beauty.

That illusionary element is
what attracted Simerson to the

Simerson ﬁrst asked each
student to introduce themselves,
and then later he made them indi-
vidually walk across the stage.

From just those two exercis-
es, Simerson announced that he
had interpreted each individual
‘s personality.

He used this exercise to show

9 that presentation is everything,

and taking big risks can make
someone more comfortable in
how she presents herself.

During the class, Simerson
encouraged students to explore
their movements so that their
movements became bigger and
bolder.

He did this by making each

student improvise for a minute
with different music.

Toward the end of the class,
Simerson let students experi-
ment with some of the Momix
performance props. ~

He let students bounce around
on long poles and swing from a
metal prop that worked similar to
aseesaw.

Simerson said that he just
wanted to see students having
fun.

“He simply captured that joy
of dancing,” said sophomore
Kali McFarland.

Simerson’s regular classes
are similar to the master class he
taught.

With the exception of props,
his regular classes have compo-
nents of yoga, improvisation,
technique and performance.

Simerson said that he wants
dancers to walk away feeling
more comfortable with them-
selves and with more insight into
who they really are.

“I push them until something
not so choreographed comes
out,” he said. “Then you see in-
dividual personalities.”

Lady Generals boast young team

With only one returning senior: the Lady Generals will look to use their young players to make a dent in the ODAC Conference

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

In most cases, the only purpose of
preseason athletic polls is to provide
bulletin board material for the teams
involved. If a team is picked to ﬁnish
ﬁrst, then the coach will usually brush it
off and make sure the players don’t get
inﬂated egos and assume the title will
just be handed to them. For all those

- teams not picked ﬁrst, the poll becomes

motivation to prove it wrong. The Wash-
ington and Lee University women’s
basketball team will fall into the latter
category, as they were picked to ﬁnish
sixth in the eleven-team Old Dominion
Athletic Conference.

Head coach Mandy King is entering
her seventh season at the helm for the

Generals. She is the program’s all-time

wins leader with 72 victories. She will_

be assisted on the bench by second-year
coach Abby Pyzik.

The pair led the Generals to a very
respectable year last season. The team
ﬁnished with a middling record of 14-
12, but hidden in that record are thir-
teen regular season conference wins, a
school record. The team went 9-3 down
the stretch last year, but unfortunately
was bounced in the ﬁrst round of the
conference tournament in a heartbreaker
to Bridgewater College. The team looks
to reverse its playoff fortunes this year.
And with a strong returning cast, that
goal is deﬁnitely within reach.

The 2009-10 Generals will ﬁeld
an extremely young team. With only
one senior, Kaitlyn Kamp, eight of the
eleven players are ﬁrst-years and sopho-
mores. In that young group are the Gen-
erals’ top three scorers from last year.
Sophomores Becca Bolton and Meg In-
gram are both back, as is Junior center
Felice Herman.

All three posted some gaudy statis-
tics last year. Ingram led the team with
15.5 points per game as an everyday
starter. She quickly became known as
a long range assassin, setting a school
record for three point ﬁeld goals in a

. season (79) and ﬁnished eleventh in the

nation in three pointers per game (2.9).

She garnered Second Team All-ODAC
honors and was named rookie of the
year for the ODAC, Virginia College
Division, and South Region. Her game
will not take anybody by surprise this
year as she can expect many defenses to
key in on her.

Bolton and Herman were second and
third on the team in scoring, averaging
12.4 and 10.2 points her game respec-
tively. More impressively, and perhaps
more importantly, they both averaged
over seven rebounds a game and were
high percentage shooters. Coach King
will count on these three to again lead
the Generals. With another year of ex-
perience under their belts, expectations

will be even higher after a successful
year last season.

The road will not be easy. Roanoke
College was only missing one vote to
become the unanimous No. 1 ranked
team in the preseason poll. The team is
a perennial powerhouse and was joined
at the top of the rankings by Randolph-
Macon, Eastern Mennonite, Bridgewa-
ter, and Virginia Wesleyan. All should
be tough opponents.

There is no denying the Generals
have the talent to compete and succeed
in the ODAC this year. The question will
be if youth can prevail. The women’s
ﬁrst match-up is Nov. 17 against Mary
Washington. ‘

A familiar foe ended the Generals’
NCAA Tournament run on Sunday, as
Lynchburg College scored a goal in
each half to advance to the Sweet Six-
teen. The loss came only one day after
the Lady Generals defeated Christopher

Newport, 4-0, in the ﬁrst round of the
NCAA tournament.

The match was Lynchburg’s third
visit to Lexington this season. The two
teams played to a 0-0 draw during the

What energizes you about taking on
leadership responsibilities? It gives me
the opportunity to enhance an organization
and inspire its members to do great

things. Developing subordinates is one of the
most significant aspects of leadership, and it
feels great to give advice to those who seek

What has been one of your most re-
warding aspects of leadership at W&L? My pledge brothers
and I re-founded Beta Theta Pi at Washington and Lee, and it has
been a privilege to watch the chapter develop over the last two
years. As the first president, I had to invest a good bit of time in
the organization, and it has been very rewarding to see how well it
has done. Nearly every member has attended a leadership develop-
ment program, and I think we have one of the best service records

What legacy of leadership do you hope to leave for oth-
ers who follow you here? I hope those who follow have learned
the value of integrity and honor and choose to pass those values

on. It has sometimes been challenging to do what is right and do it
well, but I have endeavored to adhere to that standard in every
organization in which I have taken part.

2-1 victory in the ODAC Tournament
two weeks ago. This time, however,
Lynchburg took control early and got
their revenge.

Senior midﬁelder Shelley Hoath
slipped through the Generals’ vaunted
defense midway through the ﬁrst half,
collecting a pass and turning it into her
team-leading 12th goal of the season.
Her sister, Ashley Hoath, put to rest any
comeback hopes when her 63rd min-
ute comer kick deﬂected off of the post

and into the net. The 2-0 lead was more
than enough for the Lynchburg defense,
which held strong and limited the Gen-
erals to just two shots on goal.

It was a disappointing ending to an
impressive season for W&L. The team
came into the tournament ranked 10th
in the nation and ﬁrst in the South re-
gion. After ﬁnishing the regular season
14-1-3 (9-0-2 in the ODAC), the Gen-
erals rolled through the ODAC tourney.

A penalty-kick victory over Virginia
Wesleyan sealed their ﬁrst conference
championship since 2006 and earned
them an automatic NCAA _bid.

Facing Christopher Newport in the
ﬁrst round, the Generals erupted for four
second half goals, including two off of
corner kicks by senior midﬁelder Mag-
gie Sutherland.

“We came out ﬂying,” Sutherland
said. “It’s not always clean, but we were
taught to crash the box.”

W&L outshot Christopher Newport
9-1 in the ﬁrst half, but couldn’t exploit
the advantage.

“We just weren’t_ putting the ball
away,” Sutherland said. “We talked [at
halftime] about having a killer instinct.”

The Generals came out of the break
playing inspired soccer, pressuring

CNU’s defense into turnovers and ﬁn-

ishing set piece opportunities. After
Sutherland gave W&L a 2-0 lead, ﬁrst-
year midﬁelder Ainsley Daigle convert-
ed a penalty kick 10 minutes later to seal
it. First-year midﬁelder Katie ‘Howard
capped the scoring in the 89th minute
with her sixth goal of the season.

As Sutherland was subbed out, the
senior captain received a warm ovation
from the crowd, and the celebration was
on.

“Every game is our last,” she said.

  

“That’s how we’re playing it. It means
everything.”

Unfortunately for Sutherland and
fellow senior Roz Klann, their college
careers would come to an end the next
day. The loss marks the second consecu-
tive year Lynchburg has ended W&L’s
season. The Hornets won 1-0 last year to
eliminate the Generals from the ODAC
Tournament.

Sutherland ﬁnished with 15 goals
over her four years. A four-year starter,
she played both defense and midﬁeld,
winning ODAC Rookie of the Year and
being named to the All-ODAC First
Team twice.

Klann also started for four years and,
with Sutherland, steered W&L’s record-
setting defense. She notched 20 goals
and won All-ODAC accolades in 2007
and ’08.

 

The NCAA tournament berth was
W&L’s ﬁrst since 2006. The team will
return nine of 11 starters next year, in-

cluding leading scorers sophomore Allie _

Espina and Daigle. Sophomore keeper
and ODAC Player of the Year Emily
Leary will also be back in 2010.
