VOLUME CXIII,

, Men’s Week

explodes on
campus

W&L males take their turn

at loving their bodies

By Dick E. Johnson
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee campus was half-empty
this week as tumbleweeds bounced around empty
dormitory hallways and fraternity hallways. Windfall
became the tranquil setting that landlords always
dreamed of. The baseball and lacrosse coaches
waited impatiently for their players to show up to
practice. But nobody would come.

The Knowledge Uplifting Men (KUM) group on
campus is under fire this week for its controversial re-
sponse to KEWL’s Love Your Body Week. Ever since
it splattered onto the scene three years ago, KUM has
tirelessly worked to promote men’s awareness around
campus. Despite some trouble getting the group up
and running initially, the group’s representation is
swiftly growing in size, and coming into the week,
KUM looked ready to explode at W&L.

However, KUM has not been without its setbacks.
Its version of the Red Flag Campaign two years ago
was quickly shut down when it was discovered men
were starting to share secrets that were too detailed
and maybe even a little too accurate.

In addition, KUM decided to spit out a couple
of “Did You Know?” posters about famous men in
history to complement their Red Flag Campaign.
Unfortunately, the administration needed to step in
and cockblock the situation once professors started
noticing some flaws in the “Did You Know?’ cam-
paign. Apparently God isn’t necessarily a man. Who
knew? I

The low—point in KUM’s history came two years
ago when the heads of the group decided to post some
anonymous stories about sexual assault at W&L.
Since they were conveniently both heads of the Tri-
dent at the time, they thought that March would be
an excellent time to voice all of the social abuses that
happen at W&L all at once. The athletically—minded
administration misconstrued the awareness campaign
for some kind of faux bracket and decided to pull the
plug on the Trident. KUM lay ﬂaccid.

But aﬂer two years of build-up and waiting, KUM
seemed a little too ready to go this spring. Desperate
to get some kind of action off as soon as possible,
the new heads of KUM decided to host their own
version of “Love Your Body” week. Thinking that
the plan was sure to stick onto the hearts and minds
of students across campus, they sold shirts, made
posters and even posted a little message on “Campus
Notices.”

However, KUM’s dream turned into a nightmare
in less than ten seconds. On the ﬁrst Monday of the
male “Love Your Body Week,” every door on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor of Graham-Lees was locked tight and not
a male was to be seen. Kroger, CVS and Walmart
all had to put new orders in for their empty lotion
aisles, and there are no longer any Kleenex tissues
in Rockbridge County.

Also, there will be a memorial service at Lee
Chapel this Friday for the recent death of baby angels
and kittens in the town of Lexington. Apparently, at
W&L men do love their bodies... just maybe a little
too often.

Having made a mess of everything, KUM has
recently released a statement that it pledges to -“clean
this mess so that no stains will be left.” They have
also said that they are “sincerely sorry and had no
idea that it would work like that.”

An administration official certainly hopes so:
“This campus is starting to look like Sweet Briar. It’s
ridiculous. Also, none of the video streaming works
online. Damn that March Madness!”

The repercussions of KUM’s mess will be felt
for weeks, but there is still hope for the future. They
are currently working in tandem with VMl’s KUM
chapter on a new campaign to promote the plight of

-“unwanted touching” that men face daily in the town
of Lexington: l in every, oh, about 412 or so.

Just remember, as KUM says: CLEAN IT UP.

Drug bust at
Lee House?!

Suspicious substances found at President Ruscio is house, but students and SJC
question whether his intent to distribute really violates the honor system

By crystal Beth
STAFF WRITER

The Rockbridge County Sheriff’s
Department and Lexington Police
Department continue their investiga-
tion of the Lexington drug ring that,
it seems, touches all echelons of the
Washington and Lee community.

The Department conﬁscated what
it believes to be drugs in a March
27 search of the Lee House, where
President Ken Ruscio resides.

The material conﬁscated includes
923 bags of white powder, making
this the biggest drug bust in Lexing-
ton since the Jan. 23 search. In the
real world, this quantity is generally
considered indicative of an intent to
distribute.

A guilty verdict of intent to dis-
tribute Schedule II drugs (metham-
phetamine, morphine, PCP, cocaine,
methadone and Ritalin) carries a mini-
mum penalty offive years in jail.

However, no arrests have been
made at this time.

Rockbridge County Sheriff Bob
Day said that the investigation is
ongoing. “I don’t think we under-
stood how fully the drug issue had
permeated the W&L community,”
he said. “We’re still trying to gather
the facts.”

While it may appear to some that
the facts point to Ruscio as a cocaine
distributor to W&L students, Day said

that the evidence is not certain. The
most important factor on Ruscio’s
side is that the material was found
within the W&L bubble, not actually
in Lexington.

Although the quantity of material
conﬁscated can mean intent to distrib-
ute, it could also mean intent to party
like it’s Wall Street in the 1980s. The
fact that the baggies were discovered

to Colombia.

“The W&L community should
not overreact to this news,” she said.
“Drug busts happen. What matters
here at W&L is that students and
faculty uphold the honor system
in all aspects of life. And if you’re
having awesome parties, you should
acknowledge everything that aided
you in doing so.”

“The point of the honor system is that we

hold one another accountable. But I wouldn’t

want to be held accountable for this. So why
should I hold K-Rusch accountable? ”

WORTHINGTON ALEXANDER HOLEKAMP ROCKWOOD V,

SJC rep

the day ofFancy Dress could point to
innocent plans for a really awesome
after-party at the Lee House that, be-
cause of the bust, did not occur.
Ruscio was not available for com-
ment. According to Dean Dawn Wat-
kins, he was called away on business

The general attitude of the W&L
community appears to be in agreement
with Watkins. “Why are we holding
Ruscio to a higher standard than we
hold ourselves?” asked sophomore
SJ C representative Worthington Alex-
ander Holekamp Rockwood V.

“The point of the honor system
is that we hold one another account-
able. But I wouldn’t want to be held
accountable for this. So why shouldl
hold K-Rusch accountable?

“lt’s not like he cheated on a test,”
Rockwood added. “This is a much
more low-key issue, like sexual as-
sault or something.”

However, some members of the
W&L community are not as lax (nor
as sweet) in their judgment. ‘‘I think
that’s against the law,” said one female
student who wished to remain anony-
mous. “He should like, go tojail or do
community service. I think. And like,
what are they doing with the cocaine?
Are they going to share?”

It is, in fact, not clear what pun-
ishments Ruscio may face if he is
found guilty of possession and intent
to distribute. After all, the alleged
crime occurred on campusAnot in
the real world. “But would he even
go to the SJC for a hearing?” asked
Rockwood. “He’s not a student. But
he used to be?”

Traveller plans to oﬂer a cash bar on buses to bring in money and expand routes

By Maryjane Houston C-School DuPont

ALCOHOLIC

The successful safe ride program
known as Traveller is looking to
expand its service by adding two
additional buses by the start of the
next fall term.

But the task of hiring new driv-
ers and purchasing new buses will
require more money than originally
anticipated. Students and Traveller
staff havetossed around various sug-

The committee doesn’t doubt that
the project would bring in money. In
addition to fundraising, having access
to a bar will make the experience of
riding Traveller more enjoyable, thus
encouraging more people to take
advantage of the service, said this
student. “There will be no reason not
to ride Traveller,” she said.

Students, drivers and Traveller

“There is no hope for getting a job when we

graduate in two months. All we can really do

is get blackout as often as possible, or we ’ll

just be depressed, you know?”

gestions for bringing in funds, and the
most popular one is to implement a
cash bar on the Traveller buses.

“It seemed like the obvious
choice,” said a member of the stu-
dent Traveller committee. “People
ride Traveller because they like to
drink.”

staffers have reported an increase in
the demand for sober rides this year,
Dean Dawn Watkins said. Students are
partying longer and more frequently,
and the need for transportation has
exceeded the current capacities of the
bus and dispatch systems.

One senior economics major,

Robert Conrad Vlll, said he blames
the economy for the recent surge in
partying seven days a week. “There’s
no hope for getting a job when we
graduate in two months,” he said.
“All we can really do is get blackout
as often as possible, or we’ll just be
depressed, you know?”

The new buses and drivers would
allow Traveller to expand its routes to
reach more off-campus houses. The
buses will also be able to make stops
more frequently, so students will not
have to wait as long.

If the fundraising project is suc-
cessful, the buses will expand their
service to seven days a week instead
of the current schedule of Wednesday,
Friday and Saturday.

The new cash bar service will
include a bartender and a small but
well-stocked bar in the back of each
bus. The initial service will offer a
variety of beer, wine, vodka and rum,
but if successful, it could be expanded
to a full bar.

Students polled expressed over-
whelming enthusiasm for the new
service. Some said the offer of
more alcohol is an incentive to ride
Traveller instead of driving home
drunk or falling asleep on the lawn
at Windfall.

“Getting on Traveller and having

to abstain from drinking for the nine-
minute ride back to the quad is such a
letdown,” said ﬁrst-year Ashley-Beth
Louisa Hadley. “Now, we can just
keep partying all the way back!”

Traveller staffers who worked on
this proposal were concerned that stu-
dents might not want to pay for drinks
when they could get them free at the
party they just left. But houses often
run out of beer and plastic cups before
the parties clear out, and party-goers
tire quickly of Natty from a keg. The
hope is that shots and cocktails on
Traveller will provide an appealing
alternative and encourage students
to shell out some cash for a few more
drinks.

It is not yet known whether or
not the Traveller bartenders will be
required to check lDs.

Swine flu means no more sunrises

Sunrise sandwiches, the popular breakfast item served at the co-op, have been linked to a rise in H 1 N1 cases

By Samuel Adams
BREWER PATRIOT

Cafe ’77, otherwise known
as the co-op, has discontinued
serving sunrise sandwiches after
a government report linked the
breakfast concoctions with last
year’s outbreak of swine ﬁu.

While ﬁrst-years will not re-
member the swarm of reporters
who descended upon the Wash-
ington and Lee campus after it
was the home of some of the
ﬁrst reported cases of HINI in
Virginia, many students ﬁnally
realized the gravity of the situ-
ation after the co-op quit selling
sunrises.

The report from the Food and

Drug Administration admonished
W&L Dining Services for selling
the sandwiches, noting that pigs

, and pork products are clearly

declared unclean in Leviticus 11.
According to the report, Dining
Services “should have foreseen
that the consumption of pork

“It is so important that students take care

of themselves by washing their hands and

not doing heroin and eating breakfast. ”

JAN KAUFMAN, director of health promotion

products could be hazardous to
customers’ health.”

Students are reportedly tak-
ing a variety of safety measures,
including more frequent hand-
washing and adhering to other
statements in the ritual Jewish
law. Students are now ignoring
shellﬁsh and not wearing clothes
made of two different materials.

Director of Health Promotion
Jan Kaufman was ecstatic that
students were ﬁnally paying at-
tention to principles of basic hy-
giene, such as making sure one’s
hands are clean before eating a
sunrise—or anything else.

‘‘It is so important that stu-
dents take care of themselves
by washing their hands and not
doing heroin and eating breakfast
—obviously not those sunrise
sandwiches, though.”

Kaufman added that students
should be nice to Traveller driv-
ers and not smoke marijuana.
She also asked if her new posters
about underage drinking were
attractive.

Several students, including
sophomore Levi Throckmor-
ton, said that Dining Services
should have put a warning label
on the delectable—and profit-

able—snacks.

“It just seems so obvious in
retrospect: of course we would
get swine ﬁu from eating pork,”
Throckmorton said. “We’re just
lucky there hasn’t been another
outbreak,” he added.

Dining Services plans to have
sunrise sandwiches back for sale
within the week with new meat
options, such as beef and chicken.
Until then, students will have to
ﬁnd other options to satisfy that
late-night hunger.

Copy editors stop

Their have been tuns uv
complaints sent into the Wring
Tum Fi office over the past
week about the quality of copy
editing in the newspepper. Af-

' ter weeks, of long hours and

‘ tire-less, Thankless work, thuh

for the kids at skool, the copy
editors wanted to sleep and stuff.
Lifes just different then it used
to be back in the day wen copy
editors were ‘loved.

“May be I will want to work
more if we get to lay down. But ,

“Your not gonna believe what we

have to go threw here. ”

KATHRIN ROOBBERTS, copie editr
 

A copy editors decided that enuf

was enuf.

“Your not gonna believe
what we have to go threw here,”
sed one of the most inﬂamed
editors.-

Having to wrok late days

I just was two much for editors
I guess. Each and every editor
especially explicates either con-
sistent or persistent methods of
checking stuff and things within
articles.

Ever since some year when
they started coming, copy edi-
tors have had a mad crazy affect
on how super—duper awesome
the newpaper can bee.

How? Ever times have

1 changed! With Work pillingup,

exams coming, and teacher’s '
making homework, and stuff

for right now, we really need to
get to work?”

And the regular are still doing
ﬁn w/o having to worry about the
worrisome copy editors.

OH, I forgot, a copy editor
said that last comment right be-
fore that last sentence. The head
editor assured everyone again
that the reg. editors r much more
imPortant than them. Them is
the ocpy editors btw.

In other news, the head of
the English Department recently '
suffered a heart attack after read-
ing this article.

Fire Chief Ty Dickerson found

 

the new top level in violation of
no fewer than sixteen ﬁre safety
codes. The most notable violation
is the floor-wide recycled-mate-
rial content, which is both highly
ﬂammable and a crime against
interior design.

“lt’s unbelievable that they
thought adding a video editing
room to this monstrosity of a
building was worth risking the
lives of students,” Dickerson
remarked in his report.

He added that “the coffee cart
is just another accident waiting
to happen.”

To get the library back up to
code, a reverse renovation will be-
gin at the end of Spring Term. The
project is expected to take about
two years, as ﬁnding paneling to
match the building’s original 1979
exterior may take a while.

As during the original reno-
vation, which started during the
summer of 2008, the circulation
desk will be moved near Northen
Auditorium on the Lower Level 1,
which is the second level from the
top. It really makes no sense.

Senior Nicole Allaband, who
works at the circulation desk, is
supportive of the changes. “I’m
glad the school is putting the stu-
dents’ safety ﬁrst. Plus, my job
is so much easier when we’re not
on the main ﬂoor—hardly anyone
knows where to ﬁnd us.”

The IT HelpDesk will also be
relocating. Instead of returning
to a lower level, however, they
will be occupying a new loca-
tion——joining the Business Office
on the second floor of the old
courthouse.

Junior EW Malachosky, a
HelpDesk work-study, reports
that moving the service into
town should expedite computer
repair services, as “no one in
their right mind will be lugging
their computer to 2 South Main.
The one guy dumb enough to do
that will have virtually no line in
front of him.”

Most Washington and Lee
students will ﬁnd swiping home a
new MacBook from the bookstore
much more convenient.

Still, not all ofthe original $3.5

million project will go to waste.
The distinctive egg-shaped seats,
which are manufactured entirely
from celery, will be used in the
Marketplace as part of W&L
Dining Services’ Sustainability
Initiatives.

The large flat-screen tele-
vision, which currently greets
students who enter the library
from the side entrance, will join
the other ﬂat-screen in the Elrod
Commons atrium. The adminis-
tration is still keeping the purpose
of the ﬁrst flat-screen in the Com-
mons secret.

Some pieces of furniture, such
as the high—backed couches found
in the rear ofthe main level, will
not be kept. Start checking Cam-
pus Notices this Spring Term to
own your own piece of W&L
history and to support the $3.5
million effort to re-renovatate
Leybum Library.

Even shorter spring  

Spring term shortened to 12 days, classes will meet at least 16 hours a day

By Trevor the Toad
CROSSWORD ASSISTANT

Get ready to say goodbye to
the new Spring Term: President
Ruscio has already begun discuss-
ing changes for next year’s term
schedule.

“The feedback we’ve gotten so
far this year about the reduction to
a four-week Spring Term is over-
whelming,” Ruscio declared in a
recent release on the Washington
and Lee website. “To capitalize
on this success, Spring Term 2011
will be only 12 days long.”

Students will experience “fully
engaging” courses, such as Chi-
nese 327: History ofthe Egg Roll
and Music 271: The Complete
Works of Celine Dion.

Each course will meet for at
least 16 hours a day. The dining
hall will not be expanding its
hours of operation to accommo-
date students.

Many courses will require
additional fees. One journalism
course will require students to
purchase HD video cameras~
students will not be permitted to
keep the extra equipment after the
course is over. Not all courses
will disclose these costs before
registration.

Other courses will involve
travel around the United States.
Professor Harlan Beckley is
planning a poverty class in which
students will live on the streets of
Camden, NJ. for a week.

Students will pay over $1,000
for this trip, which does not pro-
vide food or lodging. “It’s an
engaging experience that I know
most W&L students will be inter-
ested in,” remarked Beckley.

“Undergraduates at this school
have grown tired of going to Gos-

hen every weekend,” he said.

The professor expects around
40 or 50 students to try to get into
his course, though onlytwelve
spots are available.

In fact, for the 1,700 under-
graduates who will be at W&L
next spring, only 450 spots will
be available in a total of 32
courses. Many of those courses
will be offered by the Russian
department.

Ruscio believes that limiting
the options available to students
will force them to truly achieve a
liberal arts education.

“If these kids really wanted to
learn math or physics, they’d have
gone to MIT,” he said. “They
want broader horizons, and we’re
happy to oblige.”

To this end, Ruscio is also
eliminating the Spring Option.

“There’s nothing that an intem-
ship in New York or Washington
can teach our students that can’t
be learned right here in Rock-
bridge County.”

Besides the poverty courses
that put students in realistic situa-
tions of poverty, all other courses
involving travel, such as Spring
Term Abroad, will be canceled.

A source from the faculty
said none of the faculty were
actually consulted before Ruscio
made this decision about the new
spring term.

“Ruscio knows best,” said
this professor, who preferred to
remain anonymous.

When asked what they thought
about these new Spring Term
plans, every W&L student re-
plied, “It sucks.”

Finding a
match

W&L students band together
to help with a junior 3 battle

against leukemia

By Allison Chopin
MANAGING EDITOR

The Alphi Phi Alpha fraternity partnered with
the American Cancer Society to host a bone mar-
row drive in the Commons on Friday in honor
of a Washington and Lee student who is battling
cancer.

Junior Erica Regester was diagnosed with leu-
kemia in high school and declared cancer-free in
2008. But in December, she relapsed and has been
undergoing treatments again. She is currently in
need of a bone marrow transplant.

The drive on Friday allowed members of the
W&L community to add their names to the bone
marrow registry. By doing this, they could become
a match for a cancer patient in need, such as
Regester.

Students who participated saw the drive as
a chance put their names out there as potential

“I would hope that if I was
in a position where I needed
something like this, other
people... would be willing to

I

overcome their fears... ’

RANDI WILSON, first-year
 

donors who could save a patient’s life.

“I would hope that ifl was in a position where
I needed something like this, that other people like
me would be willing to overcome their fears to do
the same,” said ﬁrst-year Randi Wilson.

Wilson said she was interested when she saw
the posters around campus that shared Regester’s
story instead of just asking people to sign up for a
donation drive.

“It meant a lot more that they put a name and a
face to the bone marrow drive,” she said.

Participating in the drive was a simple, l5-min-
ute process. Those interested visited the Commons,
ﬁlled out a form, and had their cheeks swabbed.
The tissue sample taken from the saliva is used to
match the donor with potential patients who need a
transplant. By signing up, donors agreed that they
would be willing to donate to any patient in need.

The goal was to have 100 students, faculty and
staff sign up for the drive, said Sean Bates, advisor
for Alpha Phi Alpha. The event was held from 9
am. to 4 p.m., and Bates said students were lining
up to participate as early as 8 a.m. By 2:30, nearly
70 had signed up.

Regester was active in last year’s Relay for
Life, a fundraiser for cancer patients. She gave a
talk about her experience with cancer at the event,
and she also started the shaved head contest. For
the contest, people donated money to vote for a
male professor, and the winning professor would
have to shave his head.

Losing one’s hair is one of the painful experi-
ences that come with battling cancer, so Regester
wanted to illuminate this reality as well as start
a fun competition, she said last year. The contest
raised over $500.

Regester could not be reached for comment this
past weekend.

Less noise, shorter parties?

New ordinance calls for quieter nights, but could better student-neighbor relations

By Lizz Dye
STAFF WRITER

The Rockbridge County Board
of Supervisors held a public hearing
this Monday, March 22 at 7 pm. and
passed a proposed new county noise
ordinance. This noise ordinance was
passed as a result from years of com-
plaints from residents who live near
students and have suffered from the
noise and trash that students make.
Particular sections of the ordinance
which may affect students are listed
below:

Article IV, Section 4-40 ofthe or-
dinance states that “at certain levels,
noise can be detrimental to the health,
welfare, safety, peace, and quality of
life of the citizens of the county, and
in the public interest, noise should
be controlled. It is, therefore, the
policy ofthe County to reduce noise
in the county and to prohibit certain
unnecessary, excessive, harmful and
annoying noises.” _

The ordinance deﬁnes “noise” as
“any sound which annoys or disturbs
humans or which causes or tends to
cause an adverse psychological or
physiological effect on humans.”

Section 4-43 states, “It shall be
unlawful for any person, on Sunday
through Thursday between the hours
of 11:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m. the fol-
lowing day, and on Friday and Satur-
day between the hours of l l :59 p.m.
and 8:00 a.m. the following day:

(I) To use, operate or play any
radio, phonograph, television, record,
compact disc or tape player, musical
instrument, loudspeaker, sound am-
plifying equipment or other machine
or device capable of producing or re-
producing sound in such a manner or
with such volume or duration that it

is plainly audible: (i) inside the con-
ﬁnes of the dwelling unit, house or
apartment of another person or (ii) at
50 or more feet from the device.

(2) To create or allow noise
from talking, yelling, shouting, whis-
tling or singing, or any combination
thereof, that is plainly audible either
inside the conﬁnes of the dwelling
unit, house or apartment of another
person or at 50 or more feet from
the source(s) of the noise, when the
noise is generated from a gathering
of ten or more people.”

Additionally:

(1) Any person who violates
any provision of this article shall
be deemed guilty of a Class 3 mis-
demeanor for the ﬁrst offense. Any
person who violates any provision
ofthis article within one (1) year af-
ter a previous conviction under this
article shall be guilty of a Class 2
misdemeanor. Any person who com-
mits a third or subsequent violation
of any provision ofthis article within
one (1) year after a previous convic-
tion shall be guilty ofa Class I mis-
demeanor.

Senior Matt Hutton, one of the
leaders of the Campus-Community
Coalition, believes that this is a step
in the right direction towards im-
proving student-neighbor relations.
He says that there “has always been
tension between non-student neigh-
bors and students. In the past, stu-
dents weren’t really aware that many
of the residents in the neighborhoods
they live aren’t exclusively students,
but also families and adults withjobs.
The Campus-Community Coalition
tries to promote this awareness to

students because many neighbors are
upset about students being too loud
and messy.”

He says that this new ordinance
was not supposed to be targeted at
other students, and in the end there
were actually a few things that
worked in students’ favors. First,
neighbors are now more in favor of
cooperating and working with stu-
dents, and the Campus-Community
Coalition has encouraged residents
to call students’ houses before calling
the police. Hutton said he would like
to create a phone list to give to resi-
dents, and to encourage students to
develop good relationships with their
neighbors. In addition, the county
sheriffs hope that they will not get so
many calls to go to students’ houses
late at night because these calls strain
their services and they would rather
direct their resources elsewhere.

Hutton believes that these chang-
es made by the Board of Supervisors
are very minor and though they may
seem like a slap in the face, he does
not think students have any reason
to worry since the noise is only lim-
ited until ll p.m. on the weekdays.
Furthermore, he believes that as long
as students are willing to cooperate
with their resident neighbors, there
should not be any problems and
hopefully improve the tensions that
have occurred for years.

Wind wallops frosh lot

Meteorological phenomenon known as a wind shear fells trees, damages cars

By Katy Stewart
STAFF WRITER

Last Monday morning at 8 a.m.,
a wind shear accompanying a rain-
storm wreaked havoc on the north-
ern part of campus. The powerful
meteorological phenomenon tore

down trees and caused thousands of
dollars’ worth of damage to cars in

 
  
   
 
  
  
  
   
  

the freshman lot. Wind shears, such
as Monday’s, usually accompany
tornadoes and hailstorms, and fonn a
narrow gust of intense wind.

Mike Carrnagnola, the head of
Facilities Management, said that the
storm was an “oddball high pressure
and low pressure event where the
conditions came together enough to
literally snap trees in half.” The shear
“ripped a line straight through the
area,” Carrnagnola said. “The good
news is that it was not through the
middle of campus.”

The Pavilion, athletic ﬁelds and

rope course were all affected by the
shear. The batting cage at the base-
ball ﬁeld was “picked up and blown
around,” Carmagnola said, and the
ropes course needs to be put back to-
gether. However, “amazingly, not a
building was damaged,” he said.

The biggest concern was the
freshman parking lot. The shear act-
ed “almost like a buzz saw” cutting
trees in half, and four cars parked
along the edge of the lot were nearly
totaled by fallen trees. Another car
was damaged by a lacrosse goal that
was thrown by the wind into the back
of the vehicle. “A couple [cars] were
fairly severe... and we have allowed
the more severely damaged vehicles
to park temporarily in the garage,”
said Jeff Hanna, Executive Director
of Communications and Public Af-
fairs.

COURTESY OF JEFF HANNA

Carinagnola got the call about the
damage at 8:10 a.m. Monday, and he
and his team immediately started to
secure the area. Within 24 hours, the
blocked roadways and blocked access
to the freshman lot were cleared.

The next biggest goal was to no-

tify the students whose cars were
affected, and get in touch with their
insurance providers.

“We are assisting them [students]
with the reports,” said Hanna. Pho-
tos were taken and an assessor came
to determine insurance costs and li-
ability.

Health care ‘reform’ is no doubt Obama’s biggest blunder

Only eight more months until November, the month that Democrats will get the political comeuppance they deserve

By Abel Delgado
co LU M NIST

After regaining his impres-
sive sense of arrogancewan ar-
rogance that could make the last
two arrogant presidents look as
humble as Mother Theresa—
President Obama decided to
cynically challenge all those who
dare to disagree with him.

“Go for it,” our president said,
regarding attempts torepeal the
health care bill, “Be my guest.”
Well, Mr. President, only if you
insist.

Mr. President, please stop
calling the recent health care
legislation “reform.” It does not
“amend or improve by change
of form or removal of faults or
abuses.”

It is an abuse of power on
both your part and the part of
anyone who voted in favor of it
after taking an oath to protect the
Constitution.

American government much better than we think

Where exactly in the Consti-
tution does the federal govem-
ment gain the right to force citi-
zens to buy a good or servicejust
because they are alive?

ideas, taking $570,000,000,000
out of Medicare, a government
entitlement program that may
be bankrupt by the end of the
decade, to fund a new govem-

mere thought of it was enough to
turn Virginia red again, give Re-
publicans charge of New Jersey
and gain a senatorial seat in Mas-
sachusetts, of all places.

“How about using some of the most ridiculous accounting this side of

Enron? That was a great idea. Anyone who actually believes Obam-

acare will cut the deﬁcit must be on some very strong medication. ’

I

I guess the individual man-
date is such a great idea it does
not need Constitutional justiﬁca-
tion. For all the talk of your pre-
decessor ignoring the Constitu-
tion—which he did a few times
too many—your supporters are
acting as if it never existed.

Here are some other great

ment entitlement program few
people want. Medicare may be
poorly run but at least it’s popu-
lar among the electorate.

This new legislation, which to
the discredit of your legacy has
been dubbed “Obamacare,” is by
no means popular. A year of poll-
ing and elections prove this. The

If you and your followers
think you know better than the
majority of the American people,
if you think you know what is
good for us and we do not, then
you are in for a sad awakening
come November.

How about using some of the
most ridiculous accounting this

side of Enron? That was a great
idea. Anyone who actually be-
lieves Obamacare will cut the
deﬁcit must be on some very
strong medication.

Another great idea by your
companions in Congress, appar-
ently completely defecating on
the traditional legislative pro-
cess is in these days.

Reconciliation has been used
quite often, but exclusively for
budgetary matters. Is Obamacare
a purely budgetary matter? No,
but since the rules of the Senate
meant the bill would not pass,
then your cohorts simply ignored
the rules, just like you ignored
the will ofthe people.

That’s an excellent precedent
to set in a representative democ-
racy.

I can keep on going with the
many ways Obamacare is worse

than the dysfunctional system we
had prior to it, but the opposing
side will obviously not listen to
reason.

They will call my side, the
side with millions of Republi-
cans, Democrats, and indepen-
dents who wanted real reform
but recognize government slime
when they see it, extremists.

They will use the hate-ﬁlled
words of the few to stereotype
the understandable concern felt
by the many.

Fortunately for us, this will
not work. We live in a democra-
cy with regularly scheduled elec-
tions, and those who supported
Obamacare will come to learn
that votes have consequences.

Immature, unappreciative, and obsessed with partisanship, Americans still have it better than European governments

By Hal Bozarth
COLUMNIST

A purple America? We’re all
the same~young and whining,
that is.

At ﬁrst glance, today’s Amer-
ica has never been more divided.
All of her cities and coasts vote
for the Democrats, while rural
states and the South lean toward
Republican candidates. The right
and left pull toward opposite
ends of the political spectrum,
threatening to tear the country
in two.

Conservatives scream that
Barack Obama is a socialist
Muslim threatening to bring the
Red Menace home to our heart-
land, while Liberals spout off
about George Bush creating a
quasi-fascist state oppressed by

the Patriot Act.

Cry me a river. Can’t anybody
ever be satisﬁed with things as
they are?

No. Not in this country, at
least.

President Obama has been
racketing up his ‘post-partisan’
rhetoric of late — he, along with
his fellow Democratic wielders
of power, emphatically assert
that partisan politics are prevent-
ing the US from reaching its full
potential; from pulling away
from the recession; from mov-
ing forward in the perceived race
against China. What he really
means to say is, “Waaah, I want
all of my stuff done!”

THE MEDIA BOARD

with the opposition and a vision
of America as a thoroughly di-
vided nation is not unique to our
current president.

The call to move ‘beyond’
partisanship has been practically
a political constant for at least
the past thirty years.

President Bush wanted (and,
for all intents and purposes,
got) the full support of Con-
gress in going to war against
our post-9/ll enemies.

President Clinton, like
Obama, wanted a nationalized
component of healthcare.

Reagan and Bush, Sr., want-
ed to present a united front
against the ever-desperate Soviet
Empire.

What most Americans fail
to realize (or, at least, publicly
acknowledge) is that the United
States is uniﬁed to an extraordi-
nary degree.

As a young democracy, the
United States still maintains an
attitude based in immaturity:
Americans all know what is right,
what is wrong, and what should
be done. We don’t question if
we’re correct or ifthere even is a
‘right’ way to do things.

We all have an answer for
every issue facing our nation,
even if those answers vary dra-
matically from person to person,
party to party, class to class.

Take, for example, the Mus-
lim world. The conservative
right impugns the Middle East
for harboring terrorists, threat-
ening Israel, declaring Holy
War on Christianity, and for (in
Iran’s case) Inenacing the United
States and her allies with poten-
tial nuclear arsenals. The left,
similarly, viliﬁes the Caliphate
over its treatment of women,
homosexuals, teenagers and the

   

A

working class.

Looking at China’s rise to
worldwide prominence, both
ends of the American political
spectrum see China as an antag-
onist. However, each views the
alleged problem through seem-
ingly disparate perspectives:
unionist liberals bemoan the loss

lumberjacks.

We, as Americans, know
what is to be done. Our problems
lie not in what to do, how to do
it or even whether or not to do
anything at all but in actually do-
ing it.

As a result of our immaturity,
the only realistic way to change

“What mostAmericans fail to realize (or, at

least, publicly acknowledge) is that the United

States is uniﬁed to an extraordinary degree.

ofjobs to the penniless Chinese
laborer, while conservatives see
in Red China the same peril they
felt before Reagan tore down the
Berlin Wall.

Our similarities extend past
international politics, too. If you
travel anywhere in the coun-
try, from San Francisco’s Cas-
tro Street to Fred Phelps’ To-
peka, Kansas, you will be told
that something is going wrong
in America and that you must
change your ways.

Christians believe that the
‘degradation’ of American so-
ciety will bring the wrath of
God down upon us—unless, of
course, we ban gay marriage,
abortion, divorce, single parent-
hood, cosmetic surgery and Hol-
lywood.

Environmentalists believe
that the ‘degradation’ of the en-
vironment will bring the wrath of
Nature down upon us in the form
of rising sea levels, drastically
changing climates, and monthly
Katrina-like hurricanes~unless,
of course, we ban SUVs, air con-
ditioning, carbon dioxide, coal,
airplanes, factories, mines, and

liotheecilior

anything or to break any dead-
lock is to use force, be it eco-
nomic or populist.

In America, might makes
right. Thankfully, we have one
of the world’s most ﬂexible gov-
ernments at our disposal——other-
wise, we may have already had
more than one civil war.

Europeans face much more
divisive arguments within their
mature democracies. They don’t
know what to dc%or even if
anything is to be done at all.

Britain and France, espe-
cially, are at a point in their na-
tional lives where government
can openly ask: “Is there even a
‘right’ way anymore?”

They hesitate to look down at
anyone except the most blatant
of the world’s offenders: even
then, they only begin to act in
earnest when their national goals
are directly threatened. When
they ﬁnally choose to act, they
remain lethargic in the face of
public self-loathing: the Falk-
land Islands question causes
Britons to think ofthemselves as
the Imperialist wrongdoer, and
debates about who is considered

a citizen of France are making
slow progress even in the face
of a burgeoning Algerian immi-
grant population.

Western Europe (Russia, Po-
land and the like are a different
matter) faces one philosophi-
cal quandary after another. The
United Kingdom questions its
very existence.

Why isn’t it just England,
Scotland, Wales and (Northern)
Ireland? Why aren’t they sepa-
rate? Are the English holding
their massive swords to the col-
Iective Celtic throat, as they have
done for hundreds ofyears? Ifso,
that isn’t a very nicething to do.

France, Germany and the
smaller ontinental nations look
on, confused, as their sovereign-
ty is thrown into the ring and
pitted against the massive Euro-
pean Union.

What leverage does Belgium
have to play against the Euro?
Should it even remain indepen-
dent?

The United States has the
luxury of being able to do any-
thing—~and wanting, very badly,
to do something.

Domestic popular opinion is
the only thing steering the coun-
tiy, and I’m not sure we appreci-
ate this fact. America is truly an
independent nation: these united
states have a world of possibili-
ties laid out in front ofthem, and
need only pick a favorite.

Whatever it is, though, no-
body will be happy.

An open challenge to the Cadavers

Student offers the secret society a chance to regain the Cadavers ’honor

I To the Cadaver Society,

This is an open letter formal-
ly challenging you.

Over the last few years we
have been in a contest, seem-
ingly unknown to you. I have
acquired four of your banners,
re—hanging a number of them,
and this year I have unmasked
Cyrus McCormick. The score
currently stands at ﬁve — me,
zero — you. I

It seems that there is nothing
you can do which I can’t undo.
As such, I wish to oﬂ°er you a

challenge, a chance to save the
meager scrap of respect you’re
still clinging to.

I challenge you to hang a ban-
ner somewhere on campus and
keep‘ it. hanging for two nights
in a row. The time of the hang-
ing of this banner, and the two
following nights, must be dur-
ing regular school days - break
and ﬁnals will not count. If you
hang the banner during night
time, that night shall not count
as the ﬁrst night, but rather the
next two nights will satisfy the
requirement.

Additionally, the banner must

-be in a highly visible place. All

your previous locations of the
last few years have been per-
fectly acceptable locations to
hang them.

In the unlikely chance that
you are able to do so, you will
reclaim some of your lost re-
spect from both myself and the
W&L society as a whole.

However, in the event that I
succeed in this contest, I shall
be given a key to the Cadaver
tunnels or some other manner
of reward, possibly a check?

I remind you, though, that‘ this ,
contest is not about me — but "
about reclaiming the respect
that you’ve lost.

Not hanging a banner will be ‘
seen as an act of acquiescence to
my superiority.

This is not an April Fool’s
Joke — this is a chance to regain
your respect.

Spring cleaning and reviewing the articles that didn’t work

After cleaning out his closet, Stockton Bullitt reviews some of the opinion ideas which couldn ’t be made into articles

By Stockton Bullitt
OPINIONS EDITOR

Spring cleaning is ﬁnally
here, and thanks to this beautiful-
ly dreadful rain that will shower
Lexington for the week, I ﬁnally
have time to attend to the quag-
mire that is my bedroom. ‘

I know that guys are ste-

I reotypically messy and usually

when they have a few clothes on
the ground, the guy’s girlfriend
or mom beams as she rolls her
eyes and throws those shirts on
the hamper. However, I take
messiness to gargantuan heights.
I have a carpet of stained and
dirtied clothes, coupled with
sheets that would probably be
turned down by Goodwill.

You could say that I’m messy
because I’m lazy, but au con-
traire, I simply love the spring
cleaning process. I love taking an
afternoon off to rediscover shirts
I forgot I owned, random singles
and maybe even some unopened
drinks.

The only problem with spring
cleaning is actually getting my
lazy ass to start cleaning. It seems
way too arduous to drag myself
away from the umpteenth game
of Hearts to actually do some-
thing with my life. However,
once I ﬁnish that cleaning I have
a nice sense of accomplishment.

So that’s what I’m doing this
week for my opinion article: a
little spring cleaning. l’m drag-
ging out all of my failed topic
ideas, dusting them off and then
reminding myself why I wanted
to write about them in the ﬁrst
place.

But there is a reason these
ideas ended up lodged in be-
tween the futon and the moldy
Five Guys in the ﬁrst place. I’ll
make sure I remind you guys
of why I threw these topics out.
Time to close out of Hearts and
get started:

“How Sororities Greet the
Morning”

Why I liked the idea: There’s

some easy comedy here. Every

sorority has a pretty well-known
stereotype, and any time you can
insult a large group of peoplejust
so you can look better by default,
you have to do it. Plus, I just

. wanted to treat women at W&L

the same as men.

Why I threw it out: I know
it’s a little selﬁsh ofme, but I al-
ready have enough women at this
school who detest my existence. I
don’t need too many more. Plus,
I can handle angry fraternity
brothers: I’ll just get eye surgery.
But the only thing in this world
scarier than an angry sorority sis-
ter is my mom without coffee.

“2/3 the Fun”
(i.e., new spring term sucks)

Why I liked the idea: I have
heard many complaints around
campus from people who didn’t
get into any of the classes they
wanted, who can’t afford the
class they want to take and who
were irate that ﬁrst-years went

ﬁrst when sophomores went last.

Plus, that one journalism profes-
sor’s letter to the editor about
cancelling his class made the
room... uh... a little dusty.

Why I threw it out: I would
have to do actual research for
this article. People would need
to be emailed. Questions would
need to be asked. I would actu-
ally have to do some digging.
Look, I’m no superhero, so Ijust
stuck with the fake joumalism
section ofthe newspaper.
“Cancun Sucks in February”

(i.e., our spring break sucks)

Why I liked the idea: Spring
Break, like Natty and II a.m.
class, seems like one ofthose col-
lege experiences youjust have to
experience before you graduate.

Why I threw it out: I don’t
watch nearly enough MTV to
write 800 on the social beneﬁts
of body shots in Venus Beach,
Florida.

“Suck It, Republicans”
(Health Care trash—taIking)
Why I liked the idea: As a

dirty liberal, I unfortunately cele-
brated the passing of health care,
and it would’ve been nice just
to rub it in a little. Lately, l’ve
goaded some Repbulicans into
complaining about it loudly and
it sounds like music to my ears.
Why I threw it out: Convinc-
ing Jarrett Brotzman and Abel
Delgado that health care what-
ever-you-want-to-call-it isn’t the
legislative equivalent to Cher-
nobyl is like trying to convince
SPEAK it’s 1 in 5.
“7 a.m.... Thanks, Registrar”
(registration times are too evil)

stead. You win again, Registrar.

“Fancy Dress is Just Not

That Into You”

Why I liked the idea: I have
a few qualms with Fancy Dress.
One, l’ve already been to prom
and I don’t need to go to four
more that are even more geared
toward women. I mean, is next
year’s theme going to be “Must
Love Dogs?” Two, tens of thou-
sands on a four-hour dance?
Three, unless I’m in a relation-
ship, why would I want to pay
$150 for two tickets, $75 for two
dinners, $50 for a tux and another

“So that is what I ’m doing this week for my

opinion article: a little spring cleaning. 1 ’m

dragging out all ofmyfailed topic ideas,

dusting them oﬁ’ and then reminding myself

why I wanted to write about them in the first

place. ”

 

Why I liked the idea: I would
rather register for classes at 1:15
a.m. on a Friday night (or Sat-
urday morning) than sign up for
classes before the sun comes up
on Monday. I thought I came to
college for a four-year hiatus
from sleep deprivation, but the
Registrar would rather remind
me what being 16 is like. Want to
give me braces, too?

Why I threw it out: Like so-
rority girls and Republicans, the
Registrar can really mess up your
life ifyou get on its bad side. I’m
hoping to graduate before 2020,
and the only way I’m doing so is
by avoiding too much confron-
tation with the registrar. Also, I
would’ve written the article, but
I needed to catch up on sleep in-

$75 for a weekend’s worth ofal-
cohol just so I can get shut down
on the Pumptown dance floor?

Why I threw it out: Point
number three is already getting
me into trouble and expanding
on that topic will only dig the
hole deeper. Plus, messing with a
tradition that’s over a century old
is a terrible idea. Right, Jefferson
Davis?

“One on One with LexPo”

Why I liked this idea: I think
it’s high time that we start getting
on good terms with LexPo. Nei-
ther the police nor the students
likes feeling like we attend Kent
State. We can try and work some
stuff out, can’t we? Yes we can!

Why I threw it out: Around
sundown, I was walking over to

the station for the interview. Be-
ing a solo W&L student without
the sun to defend me, I was im-
mediately given a Drunk in Pub-
lic ticket.

“W&L’s Wednesday Nightlife”

Why I liked the idea: Fol-
lowing three anonymous guys
around campus on a Wednesday
night, seeing how they enjoy the
mid-week party. One of them
would’ve played World of War-
craft the entire time while the
other two would’ve no doubt
gotten themselves into trouble.

Why I threw it out: Lawyers
stepped in. Apparently, .I’m sup-
posed to tell them ﬁrst. Now I
have another restraining order to
add to my repertoire!

“The Joy of Disney”

Why I liked the idea: For
some strange reason, I had a
headache on Sunday morning.
I was in a crappy mood until I
ﬁipped the channel to “Mon-
sters, Inc.” This not only cheered
me up, but completely made my
morning. I would’ve strung out a
couple hundred words about how
secretly good movies like “Up”
and “Ratatouille” were, but...

Why I threw it out: I remem-
bered that if I’m going to talk
about kids’ movies this much, I’ll
probably need to register with the
state ﬁrst.

“How to pull an all-nighter at
W&L”

Why I liked the idea: There
are certain strategies that can re-
ally help you pull an all-nighter
at W&L, but only a few know
about them or put them into
practice. These include waiting
for the ﬁrst caffeinated beverage
until at least midnight. how to
keep yourself awake at the next
day‘s ll a.m. class and how to
get annoying people away from
your study group.

Why I threw it out: Pulling an
all-nighter makes you incredibly
lazy the next day, and since I’m
running on one right now, I know

for certain that there was no way
that I could do the research and
then write the ensuing article.
That is, without transferring to
Columbia.

“KD getting Kwan next year”

Why I liked the idea: This is an
underrated story, in my opinion.
There were quite a bit of people
who made a big deal about the
Kwan changing hands last year,
and for it to simply be passed
on again after one year could’ve
drawn a bigger reaction.

Why I threw it out: The last
person who made too big of a
deal about the Kwan got punched
in the face.

“The Monopoly Money Theo-
rem” (i.e., why swiping it home
doesn’t count for anything)

Why I liked the idea: I’m
positive that pretty much every-
one at this school has ﬁgured this
out, butjust in case you haven’t.
It would’ve been nice to do a
shopping guide to the Bookstore
when you don’t have to worry
about the repercussions until
June.

Why I threw it out: I didn’t
want my parents to ﬁnd out that
my $12 pen was really a $2 pen
and “The Hangover.”

“Even One Letter to the Editor
is Too Many”

Why I liked the idea: Just
like you, I got pretty exasper-
ated from having to edit sexual
assault article letters week after
week. There were better ways to
go about that whole process, and

back in the fall, I had a few good

ideas.

Why I threw it out: Every
time I ﬁll up a girl’s beer, I don’t
want her to think the foam is ﬁzz.
Furthermore, I think we’ve had
enough sexual assault for at least
a couple of months. Do you re-
ally want another four issues of
debate? I thought not. I’d much
rather talk about something in-
teresting, like the Registrar!

Generals hold strong in Fab Five Tourney

After a loss to UChicago, W&L women is tennis defeated Skidmore and Emory at the Mary Washington-hosted tournament

By Jayna Johns
STAFF WRITER

The No. 6-ranked Washington and
Lee women’s tennis team took on a col-
lection of impressive teams last week,
resulting in an up—and-down week. The
Generals lost 5-4 to the University of
Chicago on Wednesday; however, they
defeated Skidmore 7-2 and Emory 5-4
during the Fab Five Tournament hosted
by Mary Washington this weekend.

UChicago came to W&L’s campus
toting a No. 4 national ranking and the
No. 1 and No. 6 players in the central
region.

Two of the bigger matches of the
day were by sophomore Ellen Yeatman
and senior Lauren Caire. Second-seeded
Yeatman beat the No. 6 regional player
in Jennifer Kung, 6-4, 6-4. Caire, the
team’s No. 1 seed, nearly pulled off the
upset against the region’s No. I player,
Kendra Higgins. Caire battled down to

the wire, taking the third set tiebreaker
all the way to 11-9. The ﬁrst two sets
were also closely contended with scores
of 6-4, 5-7.

After Yeatman’s victory, the Gener-
als were tied with UChicago at 3-3, and
the back-and-forth trend continued with
subsequent matches.

The Generals’ No. 3 player, sopho-
more Ann Morris, lost her match against
Carmen Vaca Guzman, 6-3, 6-4. Sopho-
more Lauren Lukas lost the No. 4 sin-
gles match to Linden Li in another close
match at 3-6, 6-2, 10-5.

In the No. 5 match-up, sophomore
Jen Snyder won her match decisively, 6-
2, 6-4. Senior captain Blair Brzeski, who
ﬁnished out the line-up at the No. 6 spot,
also won her match, facing a tough 7-6
ﬁrst set, but dominating in the second,
6-0.

In doubles, only the No. 2 duo was
able to pull out their match. Morris and
Lukas teamed to down UChicago’s
Kung and Li, 8-4. No.1 doubles team,
Caire and Yeatman fell 8-5, and the No.
3 team of Snyder and Brzeski lost 8-4.

After the close loss to UChicago, the
Generals went to the Fab Five Touma-
ment, held by Mary Washington, where
they downed 22nd-ranked Skidmore by
a team score of 7-2 on Friday.

In singles competition, Yeatman won
her No. 1 singles match, 6-4, 6-2. Sec-
ond seeded Morris posted the lone sin-
gles loss, falling behind 6-0, 1-6, 6-0 in
a lopsided match.

Lukas won her No. 3 singles match,
6-7, 7-5, 10-3. Lukas came back from a
ﬁrst set disappointment for the win.

Snyder put away her No. 4 singles
match, 6-1, 6-2, and Brzeski posted a

similar victory of 6-2, 6-1 in the No. 5
singles match-up. First-year Sallie Grif-
ﬁn posted a tough victory in the No. 6
spot, taking down Skidmore’s player 6-
2, 5-7, 10-6.

Doubles competition also saw only
one W&L loss. The No. 1 doubles team
of Caire and Yeatman fell to Danika Ro-
bison and Nataly Mendoza, 8-4. But No.
2 doubles team Morris and Lukas won
8-2, and No. 3 team Snyder and Brzeski
also won 8-2.

Saturday continued the tournament
with a match against No. 2-ranked Em-
ory. It was a tough opponent, but W&L
came out in the lead, 5-4.

Much of the excitement stemmed
from two singles matches. Caire defeat-
ed the reigning DIII singles champion
Larne McManigle with a solid score of
6-4, 6-3 in the No. 1 spot. Lukas took her

No. 4 singles match to three sets before
securing not only her individual victory,
but also the team’s victory. Lukas ﬁn-
ished off her opponent 2-6, 6-1, 6-2.

Yeatman, playing in the No. 2 spot,
also won her match 6-3, 6-2.

W&L saw losses in the No. 3 , No. 5,
and No. 6 spots. Morris, playing at the
No.3 spot, fell 6-1, 6-0, No. 5 Snyder
lost 6-1, 6-2, and No. 6 Brzeski, dropped
6-0, 6-3.

In doubles, Yeatman and Caire
teamed for a close 8-6 victory, as did the
No. 2 team of Lukas and Morris, who
won their match 8-4. No. 3 double team
Snyder and Brzeski fell short, 8-6.

Sunday brought No. 17 Johns Hop-
kins for the Generals. The scores of the
Sunday tennis matches against Johns
Hopkins were not available by press
time.

Up-and-down week again for baseball

The Generals knocked oﬂNo. 20 Shenandoah and Emory & Henry, but dropped a double-header to Hampden-Sydney

By Stephen Peck
STAFF WRITER

The Washington and Lee baseball
team started the week strong, knocking
off the 20th-ranked team in the nation
and sweeping a double-header against
Emory & Henry. But the Generals stum-
bled toward the end of the week, losing
two games to Hampden-Sydney. W&L’s
offensive attack carried it to a 16-1 1 win
over Shenandoah and two wins over
E&H at 18-6 and 7-1. But the bats just
went cold against Hampden-Sydney,
and the Generals lost 6-4 and 3-0.

Facing off against Shenandoah, the
game looked to be a tense, low-scoring
affair. Instead, a total slugfest broke out.
W&L took a 6-1 lead in the third inning,
thanks in part to four Shenandoah er-
rors and a three-run home run by fresh-
man catcher Luke Deary. This outburst
chased Shenandoah starting pitcher Matt
Grifﬁn to the bench, starting a revolving

door of Hornet pitchers for the rest of
the game. Shenandoah had seven differ-
ent players take the mound against the
Generals and none of them had any luck
halting the onslaught.

The Generals used a three-run fourth
inning and a two-run ﬁfth to take an 11-4
lead. Shenandoah would eventually cut
the margin to 1 1-8, but W&L put the nail
in the cofﬁn with a four-run seventh in-
ning to stretch the ﬁnal score to 16-1 1.

The scoresheet was ﬁlled after this
game was over. Senior catcher Will
Lewis, senior ﬁrst baseman Hunter
Serenbetz and ﬁrst-year shortstop Johna-
than Stutts combined for eight hits.
Serenbetz, Lewis, senior third baseman
Jim Plantholt and Deary each had 3 runs
batted in. Do-it-all second baseman, se-
nior John Ditore, scored four times for
W&L.

Back to basics: the
importance of the free throw

It may not be the ﬂashiest shot in the playbook, but good free throw-
shooting can go a long way in the NCAA Tournament

By Adam Cancryn
c o L u M N I sr

Jordan Crawford’s 30-foot three point-
er to force overtime against Kansas State.
Danero Thomas’s off-balance jumper to
beat Vanderbilt. Chris Kramer’s weaving,
left-handed layup to push Purdue into the
Sweet 16. There has been no shortage
of memorable plays in this year’s wild
NCAA Tournament, and more are sure to
come with the ﬁeld whittled down to just
four teams.

But lost among the highlight packages
and made-for-TV moments are the shots
that put these players in position to play
the hero: free throws.

Free throws are often ignored as a ma-
jor element of the game because, quite
frankly, they’re boring. There is no dan-
ger of a free throw getting blocked, no
extraordinary athletic ability required, no
opportunity for the high drama that has
become a staple of college basketball. It’s
just a 15-foot, uncontested set shot.

Yet it is precisely that dull simplicity
that makes these shots so crucial. At the
free throw line, teams’ respective advan-
tages and disadvantages are eliminated.
Size, quickness, 3-point prowess, de-
fensive skill, none of that matters when
a player is on the charity stripe. It’s just
make or miss.

And in close games between evenly
matched teams, everything hinges on
those two possibilities.

Through the Sweet 16 and the ﬁrst clay
of the Elite Eight, seven games were de-
cided by 10 points or less. In six of those
seven, the winning team shot the better
free throw percentage.

Playing for a spot in the Final Four,
Butler was dominated by second-seeded
Kansas State in nearly every aspect of the
game. The Wildcats held the statistical
advantage in shots, turnovers, steals and
blocks, a product of swarming defense
that forced Butler into numerous bad pos-

sessions.
But whenever that defense became a
little too aggressive, the mid-major Bull-

dogs took full advantage. Butler hit 14 of

20 free throws, effectively evening out
the shot disparity. Kansas State, on the

other hand, converted just seven of their
14 attempts. By doubling the number of

made free throws, Butler stayed even
with their more skilled foe, and eventu-
ally pulled out the victory by, not coinci-
dentally, seven points.

In Saturday’s second Elite Eight
match-up, West Virginia took down top-
seeded Kentucky. Though the favorite
had breezed through the early rounds
by virtue of superior size and quickness
at every position, that athleticism didn’t
translate into any kind of competence at
the line. The team converted just 55.2
percent of their free throws, while West
Virginia made seven more shots and com-
piled a better overall percentage (67.6
percent).

Wins by Tennessee and Michigan
State in the Sweet 16 followed the same
pattern. Even the one anomaly, the dou-
ble-OT Sweet 16 classic between Kansas
State and Xavier, hinged on free throw
performance. Though Xavier shot a better
overall clip, the Wildcats converted four
of ﬁve free throw attempts in the game’s
waning moments, maintaining a margin
that forced their opponent to respond
with rushed three-pointers.

Now, free throws are certainly not the
only key to winning basketball games.
Georgia Tech (86.4 percent) and BYU
(83.3 percent) shot well from the line but
could accomplish little else. They both
found themselves so overrnatched that
one statistical advantage could not out-
weigh their numerous shortcomings.

But in more evenly matched contests,
free throws are not just a chance to score,

The next day, the Generals came back
home for a double-header against E&H.
The Wasps were simply outmatched
against a vastly superior W&L team.
In game one, W&L continued its recent
hobby of embarrassing the other team’s
pitchers by exploding for 14 runs in the
ﬁrst four innings.

Serenbetz started the Generals off
with a two-run shot in the bottom of
the ﬁrst inning and things just got better
from there. Nine players had a hit and an
RBI for W&L as they ran the ﬁnal score
up to 18-6.

Lewis was 4-4 with two RBI and
two runs, while Serenbetz ﬁnished 2-4
with three RBIs and two runs. Stutts and
sophomore outﬁelder Mike Decembrino
each added three hits and three RBIs.
Sophomore second baseman Alston
James clubbed a solo homer as well.

but to put the opponent at a defensive
disadvantage. Getting to the line ﬁrst re-
quires getting fouled, a development that
is often more costly than the resulting

points scored.

In West Virginia’s win over Wash-
ington, Huskies star Quincy Pondexter
picked up three quick fouls and played
just seven minutes in the ﬁrst half. He
would not score until after halftime and
ﬁnished with seven total points, far below

his 19.3 points per game average.

Butler neutralized Syracuse standout
Andy Rautins in the same way, forcing
him to foul twice in the ﬁrst half and
limiting his minutes early. As a result,
he never got into rhythm and attempted
just nine shots, eight of which were three-
point shots. He would ﬁnish with four
fouls. Additionally, though Butler is the
worst free-throw shooting team in the
Final Four, their aggressiveness has al-
lowed them to make up for their lack of
eﬁiciency. They have taken, and made,
the second-most free throws of the teams

remaining.

As the toumament’s ﬁnal days ap-
proach, there is no doubt each team will
deliver their own memorable moment,
whether it’s a buzzer beater, a half-court
heave or any one of the limitless ways to

put the ball through the hoop.

But getting to that point, being in posi-
tion to win or lose the game on a single
play, will depend on who takes advantage
of the easy points throughout the game.
The team that makes their free throws

Senior pitcher Chuck Davidson
picked up his ﬁrst win of the season. He
worked ﬁve innings, allowing only ﬁve
runs and eight hits, with ﬁve strikeouts.

Sophomore pitcher Roger Strong
threw six innings and allowed only one
unearned run in the second game against
E&H. He picked up the win and pushed
his record up to 3-0 on the year.

W&L took the lead for good in the
third inning on an RBI single by James,
which broke a. 1-1 tie. James was 2-2
with two walks, two RBIs, and two runs.
Decembrino was 2-3 on the day.

But W&L’s good fortune came to a
screeching halt on Saturday as Hamp-
den-Sydney swept a double-header from
the Generals. HSC built a 6-1 lead going
into the seventh inning. W&L mounted
a mini-rally to make things interest-
ing. RBI hits by Decembrino, Ditore

and sophomore CJ Thompson brought
the score to a 6-4 margin, but Hamp-
den-Sydney would close the door from
there.

Game two was no better. Hampden-
Sydney’s starting pitcher Ryan Daniel
improved his season record to 5-2 after
putting up six shutout innings. The Gen-
erals managed a mere ﬁve hits in this
contest, only three days after hanging a
combined 41 runs on Shenandoah and
E&H.

The end of the week was a disap-
pointment for the Generals, but it’s early
wins were enough to boost the team to a
winning record in ODAC play.

W&L will host Southern Virginia
University on Tuesday. The ﬁrst pitch is
set for 4 p.m.

Carnival comes to town

W&L played host to over I, 000 athletes in home track event this weekend

By Brooke Sutherland
SPORTS EDITOR

It seemed like everywhere you looked
this weekend, a track athlete wasn’t far
away. They were in the restaurants, shop-
ping downtown, and perusing the Wash-
ington and Lee campus. And they were all
over Wilson Field.

More than 1,000 athletes traveled from
NCAA Division 1, II and 111 schools across

the area to Lexington for the third annual .

W&L Carnival. Competing schools ranged
from ODAC foes like Roanoke College to
MIT and Shippensburg University.

“lt was an awesome turnout,” said
sophomore Dana Fredericks, who com-
peted in the 1,500-meter and 800-meter
events. “We had so many teams, from D1
to Dlll. The weather cleared up so it was a
great day for running. It was an overall fun
day with fast running.”

With so many top-notch athletes ﬂood-
ing the track, the competition for the Gen-
erals was ﬁerce. But thanks to some strong
individual performances, W&L held its
own in its home event.

“There was a lot of really good teams
there... that produced a lot of really strong
performances that could really push you
to get your times down,” said sophomore
Tyler Grant.

Grant set a new school record in the de-
cathlon, putting up a total of 5,777 points.
His all-around track prowess was good
enough for a third-place ﬁnish. Grant was
fast as lightning on the sprints, running
11.91 in the 100-meter dash and 51.63
in the 400-meter dash. He took down the
hurdles with a time of 16.52 in the 110-
meter hurdles and a time of 4:33.31 in the
1,500-meter runs.

Grant was equally as solid in the other
decathlon events, jumping 5.77 meters in
the long jump and 1.62 meters in the high
jump.

On the shot put, Grant threw for 10.29
meters. He heaved the discus 30.64 meters
and the javelin 48.46 meters. Grant vault-
ed for 3.20 meters up in the air during the
pole vault.

Senior Ben Goetsch transitioned well
from basketball season and earned a third-
place ﬁnish of his own. He jumped 1.85
meters in the high jump.

The men took home two more eighth-
place ﬁnishes in the high jump and the
relay, respectively. Junior David Doobin
jumped 1.75 meters in the high jump and
the 4x400 meter relay team ﬁnished at
3:27.27 for the other eighth place title. The

relay team was composed of seniors Brian
Bondurant and Sean Hurdiss, and ﬁrst-
years Steven Collieu and Wayde Marsh.

‘‘I’m usually on the 4x400, but be-
cause of the decathlon, 1 was off of it,”
Grant said. “They all dropped consider-
ably in their split times to run really fast.
Sean [Hurdiss] had a really strong perfor-
mance.”

First-year Marissa Thompson was a
stud for the women’s team. She took home
ﬁfth-place in the triplejump with a leap of
10.55 meters. In the long jump, she shot
ahead 4.96 meters for a ninth-place ﬁnish.
Thompson rounded out her strong perfor-

mance with a 12.86 dash in the 100-meters
for a sixth place ﬁnish.

Thompson also put her legs to use on
the fourth-place 4x400 meter relay team.
Thompson, senior Sallie Armstrong, soph-
omore Natalie Stie, and senior Maggie
Sutherland ran for 4:12.59.

Sutherland also took home an indi-
vidual victory in the 100-meter hurdles.
She ﬁnished with a time of 16.39 and an
eighth-place title.

On the discus, ﬁrst-year Taylor Maxey
beat out the ﬁeld for a third-place ﬁnish.
She threw for 35.42 meters.

Senior Kat Telfeyan closed out the
women’s top—l0 ﬁnishes with fourth-place
