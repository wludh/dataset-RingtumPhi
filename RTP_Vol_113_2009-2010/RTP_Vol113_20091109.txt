Blair on ethics

Former journalist who fabricated and plagiarized speaks at Ethics Institute,
takes the blame for choices and says his wrongdoings started with “baby steps ”

By Diandra Splcak
NEWS EDITOR

When the idea that former reporter
for the New York Times, Jayson Blair,
would speak at Washington and Lee’s
48th Journalism Ethics Institute cir-
culated the nation, many expressed
surprise and shock. One blogger went
as far as to suggest that employers
should not hire W&L journalism
graduates. Blair, accused of fabrica-
tion and plagiarism while working at
the NY Times, delivered his keynote
speech to a packed Stackhouse The-
ater Friday evening. In a red sweater
and khakis, he proposed that students
would learn more about ethics from
wrongdoing rather than focusing on
the best practice.

“One of the major problems with
the instruction of ethics is that the
focus is often more greatly on the
best practices when we can learn
the most from the worst practices,
which set ﬁrm boundaries and teach
us how good people end up doing bad
things,” 33-year-old Blair said. “If we
merely believe that only bad people
do bad things, then you good people
have no reason to learn ethics at all
for you are destined to do good, no
matter what happens.”

According to journalism ethics
professor Edward Wasserman, invit-
ing Blair to speak at the institute was
a departure from the former “heroic”
keynoters. In his introduction, Was-
serman explained why he thought
bringing Blair would help expand the
understanding of ethics on campus
and in the real world.

“I want to talk about this invitation
on two levels. First as a journalist
— I’m in the business of helping train

the next generation of journalists,” '

Wasserman said. “And as journalists
their solemn calling will be to engage
with and confront the people who
are at the center of the major events
of their time - not via e-mail, but up
close. Our speaker tonight is one such
person. That’s not to compliment him,
that’s to state a fact. So he’s exactly

smart, idealistic people to transgress,
to forgo fundamental principles, to
do things that are personally and
institutionally destructive.”

But despite his interest in Blair’s
personal journey, Wasserman stressed
that he was not interested in publicly
praising or denouncing Blair.

Wasserman provided background
on Blair’s story. Blair was a 27-

on how to avoid the rocky roads that
lead to ethical transgressions.”

Blair focused on the idea
that his ethical choices brought him
to his current place while bringing up
the accusations that have faced him in
the aftermath of his transgressions.

“I’m at peace with the knowledge
that there is no one or nothing to
blame for my troubles but myself,” he

“I ’m at peace with the knowledge thatthere is

no one or nothing to blame for my troubles but

myself I am here because of choices 1 made. ”

JAYSON BLAIR, former New York Times reporter

year-old reporter for the Times in
2003, when “it was disclosed in a
sensational front page story, that he
had, quote, ‘committed frequent acts
of journalistic fraud while covering
significant news events in recent
months. The widespread fabrication
and plagiarism represent a profound
betrayal of trust and a low point in the
152-year history of the newspaper.’”

Blair was accused of fabricating
comments, concocting scenes, plagia-
rizing information from other news-
papers and creating the impression
that he had “been somewhere or seen
someone when he had not.” Accord-
ing to an article in the Times, 36 of
73 of his articles over a seven-month
period “had substantial problems.”

Blair wrote a book about his
experiences in 2004 but since then,
he has rarely spoken publicly about
the event.

“When I was first approached
about speaking at Washington and
Lee, I was hesitant about reopening
an old wound of mine and of the
journalism profession,” Blair said.
“But I was convinced that there were
more lessons to be learned from my
experience. I believe it is my duty, de-
spite my new focus on psychological
coaching and mental health causes,
to do what I can to aid journalism
students by providing them guidance

said. “I’ve been accused of attempting
to deflect blame for fabrication and
plagiarism on the New York Times,
the profession of journalism, illness,
substances, race and an allotment of
other people, places and things. Those
accusations of blame are as big an
untruth as the lies I told. I am here
because of choices I made.”

According to Blair, ethical deci-
sions do not present themselves in
one big event, but rather happen over
a span of time.

“Rarely are our choices in life
presented as a major dramatic ques-
tion. If they were, it would be easy,”
he said. “Our most important choices
in life, including ethical ones, present
themselves in small baby steps, one
step at a time, in minor choices...
One day, you can turn around and
ﬁnd yourself close or across a line
that you never thought you’d go
anywhere near.” »

As a journalist, Blair had a clear
outlook as to why he got into the
profession.

“I entered the profession to help
people and then became convinced
that to help the most people, I had
to have the greatest impact on their
lives. And to have the greatest impact,
I needed to work at one of the best
newspapers,” he said. “Somewhere
along the way, on my way of climb-

 After the fa I I: Jayson    

ing upwards, I lost sight of the very
reason I entered journalism.”

He claimed that his goal of climb-
ing high at the Times and continually
pleasing his editors slowly led him
to the wrongs that he committed.
“No one came to my door and asked
whether I wanted to shoot journalism.
It was not so simple.”

His choices, he said, came about
through a number of “confounding
factors,” including a newsroom that
had a greater emphasis on speed and
impact and battle fatigue resulting
from the September llth attacks as
well as his own personal struggles
with mental illness and substance
abuse.

“But suffice to say, that my re-
covery from alcohol and drug abuse,
while life changing in a positive way,
was the harbinger leading the way

for the intensified presentation of t .

mental health symptoms that added
fuel to a ﬁre that was initially ignited
by my character ﬂaws, allowing it to
burn brighter and perhaps longer,”
Blair said.

Blair attended the University of '

Maryland, majored in journalism and
headed the student newspaper, the
Diamondback, as editor-in-chief dur-
ing the 1996 ~ 1997 academic year.
Blair interned with the Times in 1998,
and eventually took a full-time report-
ing position until his resignation after
his ethical setbacks. For the past two
years, he has taken a job as a certiﬁed
life coach at an agency. He specializes
in attention deﬁcit disorder (ADD),
pervasive developmental disorders,
mood disorders and substance abuse
disorders.

The W&L Journalism Ethics Insti-
tute is held twice a year and brings top
media professionals and academics to
campus. For two days, these profes-
sionals and academics hold seminars
with students from the University’s
capstone journalism ethics class.
The sessions deal with case studies
of ethical dilemmas presented by the
practicing journalists.

Two Washington and Lee pro-
fessors have recently published
new books, according to press
releases from the university.

Todd C. Peppers, law profes-
sor, and co-author Laura Ander-
son are the authors of “Anatomy
of an Execution.”

In this book they tell the story
of Chris Thomas, who was ex-
ecuted in Virginia in 2000 for
the crime of a double murder he
committed at age 17. He was 26
when he was put to death. Thomas
was one of the last in the United
States to be executed for a juve-
nile offense before the Supreme
Court ruled against the execution
of juveniles.

Anderson taught Thomas in
high school and witnessed his
execution after serving as his
spiritual advisor after the murders,
and Peppers became interested in

Thomas’s story when he heard
Anderson speak in a seminar
about the death penalty, according
to the press release.

The two decided to write about
Anderson’s personal experience

the tragedy and what could have
prevented it.

In exploring the death penalty,
“Anatomy of an Execution” looks
at various issues, from the fair-
ness of appellate review in such

and Thomas’s life while also ad-
dressing the death penalty. The
authors examined the trial and
the details of the murder, but they
also talked to family members
and friends to learn what led to

a dramatic case to the quality of
life for death row inmates.

Sister Helen Prejean, an oppo-
nent of the death penalty who was
written on the subject, applauds
the book for its illumination of

a tragedy.

“It wasn’t only the system
and the players in it that let down
Chris Thomas, the book also dem-
onstrates that again and again the
adults who might have prevented
the tragedy of the murders and the
execution leave this young boy
to grieve alone and ﬁnd his own
way in a world he doesn’t know or
understand,” she said, according
to the Web site for Northeastern
University Press.

“Anatomy of an Execution:
The Life and Death of Douglas
Christopher Thomas” is currently
available from Northeastern Uni-
versity Press.

Journalism professor Doug
Cumming’s new book looks at the
history of American journalists
and writers who started writing
in the South, suggesting that writ-
ing in the South developed from

unique motivations.

Called “The Southern Press:
Literary Legacies and the Chal-
lenge of Modernity,” his book
claims that journalists in the South
were motivated to ﬁnd an outlet
for literature rather than simply
serve the public with informa-
tion.

Cumming argues that the types
of communities in the South led to
this unique perspective of south-
ern writers. In the larger cities of
the North, in contrast, the growth
of industries and packed popula-
tions created the demand for the
expose and objective styles of
journalism.

Without these pressures, the
roots of writing in the South
were allowed to be more creative,

I Cumming claims. Journalists got

into the business so they could ex-
periment with the craft of writing.

“I think every Southern journalist
secretly wanted to write a novel
eventually,” Cumming said in the
press release.

Southern editors also took a
gentler approach to addressing
the hard issues such as the civil
rights movement.

Published in July, “The South-
ern Press” is available from
Northwestern University Press.
It is part of the “Visions of the
American Press” book series,
launched by the Medill journalism
school at Northwestern.

Why November is better than your favorite month

No Shave November is month-long exaltation of manliness is here. How are your whiskers celebrating?

By Jonathan Salm
COLU M N I st

November is the greatest
month of the year.

While some readers may
try to argue with this statement,
November’s inherent superiority
is in fact an objective truth — and
I am here to prove it.

Of course, November con-
sists of many great days, includ-
ing Thanksgiving, Veteran’s Day
and, uhhh, Thanksgiving, but
individual days cannot claim
responsibility for November’s
greatness. Each day lasts a pal-
try tvventy—four hours, whereas
the reason for November’s fame
is a month-long celebration of
manliness, masculinity and ma-
chismo.

That’s right, folks, I’m talk-
ing about beards.

Welcome to No Shave No-
vember 2009, a test of masculine
prowess and heroic will. Girls,
the elderly and the pre-pubescent

 

need not apply. For the rest of us,
however, the time is upon us to
put down the razor and let our
facial hair grow.

Maybe we’ll grow some dig-
nity, maybe some shame and
maybe all (or at least most) op-
portunity of getting laid. There’s
a reason the month is altema-
tively referred to as No Sex No-
vember.

But before you write off this
quest, grab the razor and head
for the sink, let’s consider fa-
mous bearded men and what
their beards did for them.

First, religious ﬁgures: Jesus,
Moses, Muhammad and the big
man himself — God. Not a bad
grouping, considering these guys
represent over half of the world’s
religious population.

Mythological ﬁgures: Odin,
Thor and Zeus. If you learn one
thing about either the Norse or

tolheetilior

Greek Gods, know that they nev-
er had problems with the ladies.

The world’s greatest think-
ers, artists and revolutionaries

Welcome to No Shave November 2009, a test

of masculine prowess and heroic will... the

time is upon us to put down the razor and let

our facial hair grow.

Philosophers: Socrates, Plato
and Aristotle. They laid the intel-
lectual foundations for all west-
ern culture — no big deal.

Scientists and thinkers: da
Vinci, Darwin and Freud. These
guys are scary smart, enough
said. And that’s not to mention
musicians, artists, actors and the
like.

all share beards. Who wouldn’t
want to emulate them?

How about an in-depth case
study of two such powerful
beards: those of famed and re-
cently deceased pitchman Billy
Mays and of cult ﬁgure and
professional badass Chuck Nor-
ris? These men undoubtedly fit
in among the world’s “greatest

thinkers, artists and revolution-
aries.” Billy’s passionate pitches
and Chuck’s unmatched mascu-
linity don’t exist because of spe-
cialized training or innate skill.
No, they exist because of these
men’s great beards. Glorious, full
and striking beards. If not shav-
ing throughout November makes
me half the man, nay, a twelfth
the man of either of these great
men, then I will be satisﬁed.

This month-long quest may
seem overly quixotic to some
and downright stupid to others,
but it is the truest test of one’s
self-control, willpower and
honor, even if it means putting
up with unsightly facial hair for
thirty days.

Mostly, however, I would like
to stress honor, which is particu-
larly apposite considering the
school we attend. If anyone is an
authority on honor, it is the revo-

lutionary who transformed our
institution - Robert E. Lee, who,
yes, rocked a beard.

The evidence seems to be
overwhelming: beards are great,
the growing of one is great, thus
No Shave November must be the
greatest month.

To those dedicated enough
to undertake this great venture:
Godspeed, and good luck.

Should we censor sexual assault or encourage discussion‘?

There are various coping methods, but victims of sexual assault shouldn ’t fear speaking up at W&L

Sexual assault is a much larger
problem at Washington and Lee
than it is on most college cam-
puses. END IT is a movement
that seeks to end sexual assault
at W&L no later than 2030.

Thus far, the publication of
survivor stories has been a very
important part of our attempt to
remove the shroud that has tradi-
tionally silenced this issue.

Not all survivors of sexual as-
sault deal with their experiences

the same way and in fact, there
is a huge range of reactions.
This makes it difﬁcult for END
IT to effectively confront the
sensitive issue of sexual assault
without making some individu-
als (whether affected by sexual
assault or not) uncomfortable.
While some survivors choose
to deal with their experiences
through ofﬁcial reporting and
professional counseling, others
choose only to confide in their

stories should be considered as
well.

Although sharing an account
of sexual assault is a difﬁcult
task, it is also a huge step in the
healing process for many indi-
viduals. Doing so anonymously
also removes the stigma from
these survivors and allows them
to overtly challenge the status
quo.

Many people on campus read
posters with our sexual assault
and rape statistics and openly
say that they do not believe the
numbers are accurate.

The aim of the stories is
therefore twofold. First to tell

ple can no longer ignore them or
say that they are untrue.

END IT respects the various
coping strategies of all survivors.
Nevertheless, sexual assault is
not just a personal problem; it is
also a social dilemma.

It is helpful to address it in a
public forum. If END IT were
to stop distributing accounts of
sexual misconduct, it may calm
the symptoms of individual sur-
vivors but would fail to address
the campus-wide problems of
disbelief and an unwillingness
to help.

campus culture.

Until now, it has been ta-
boo to admit to having been
sexually assaulted. END IT
would like to encourage and
empower survivors who wish
to share their stories and their
personal struggles with us,
their friends, a counselor, etc.

Our goal is to have all
members of the campus com-
munity join the dialogue. We
look forward to hearing your
questions, comments, and sto-
ries. Email us at endit@wlu.edu.

Defending the 27-time World Champion New York Yankees

After winning their ﬁrst World Series since 2000, a Yankee fan can ﬁnally breathe easily.

By Stockton Bullltt
OPINIONS EDITOR

It may not have been a big
deal for you, but this past Thurs-
day something special happened.

Yes, this special thing wasn’t
exactly new to the world, con-
sidering it had already occured
26 times, but still, it was special.
For the ﬁrst time in nine years,
the Yankees are champions of the
world.

Over the past few days, there
have been a plethora of com-
plaints about the Yankees win-
ning the World Series. They
were the ﬁrst ones to win with an
admitted steroid user. They got
incredibly lucky on their road to
victory. Finally, the biggest com-
plaint of all - they bought their
championship for a boatload of
money.

I would like to dispel some of
these erroneous arguments.

First of all, third baseman Alex
Rodriguez and pitcher Andy Pet-
tite were the ﬁrst players to win
a World Series win after being
caught with steroids.

This argument really has no
merit because everyone knows
there have been tons of convicted
steroid users who have polished
rings to make their shrunken tes-
ticles feel a little less tight. The
previous Yankees dynasty had
tons of steroid users, including
the aforementioned Andy Pet-
tite, who was only caught taking
HGH (a growth hormone that is
not as frowned upon as steroids),
Chuck Knoblach and Roger Cle-
mens.

In fact, every Word Series
winner from 1998-2005 had at
least one player convicted for

taking steroids. The only real
difference between this Yankee
team and previous World Series
winners is that the Yankee play-
ers simply got caught before
winning their rings.

Furthermore, if you are going
to get mad at Alex ‘Rodriguez,
think about this: he’s done much
worse things in his life. For ex-
ample, in July of 2008 Rodriguez
chose to cheat on his wife with
Madonna.

This is a huge travesty not be-
cause he cheated on his wife and
betrayed his kids, but because he
chose Madonna over his wife. I
cannot trust my third baseman to
spot out a ball being pitched at 90
miles an hour when he can’t see
that Madonna looks like a more
masculine version of Michael
Jackson.

Plus, in Alex Rodriguez’s
house, there are two paintings of
the Yankees star drawn as a cen-
taur.

The only real reason he had
as good of a postseason as he did
was because of Kate Hudson, his
new girlfriend. She’s so gorgeous
that when she left Owen Wilson,
he tried to kill himself. And he’s
Owen Wilson! I’m telling you,
Kate Hudson is like the real life
“Fever Pitch.”

Now, the second argument
against the Yankees is pretty
much true. There were tons of
games that were decided by
stupid coaching, the other team
making costly errors, question-
able calls from umpires, and
an overabundance of late game
comebacks.

However, the Yankees still
had all of those factors working
against them, especially in the
playoffs. Joe Girardi, the team’s
manager, tends to over manage
games because he is very inse-
cure about his job status. He’s
the kind of guy who would bet
on the St. Louis Rams just to go
with the numbers. Giradi more
than leveled out any kinds of
mistakes that any other manager
would make.

Moreover, for every bad call
or error that went the Yankees
way, the Yankees were met with
an error of their own or a blatant
make up call by an umpire. Fate
has a way of balancing things
out that way. Plus, in the World
Series, the Yankees had just as
many errors (two) as the Phillies.
Concerning late game come-
backs, every championship team
has late game luck on their side;
without it, you really can’t win a
World Series.

Now for the biggest jab
against the Yankees champion-
ship: the spending. Yes, the Yan-
kees have the highest payroll in
Major League baseball. Yes, their
inﬁeld makes more on a yearly
basis than some teams. For one,
the Yankees spent over $10 mil-
lion less dollars on their payroll
this year than they did last year.
In 2008, the Yankees didn’t even
make the playoffs, so complain-
ing that spending always equals
winning is dumb.

Besides, the Yankees are rare
in Major League Baseball in that
they make a signiﬁcant proﬁt
every year. They have their own

TV station, which they support
by themselves, and their new
stadium, despite being ridiculed
mercilessly by the media, has
helped signiﬁcantly raise the
team’s proﬁt margin. So, since
they have the money, which they
earned and shared with the rest
of the league, why shouldn’t they
spend it to make the best prod-
uct?

Major League Baseball is a
capitalist sport at its base. Every
single player is working for a
team, but their livelihood is pri-
marily based on how they play as
an individual. Although there is
some proﬁt sharing, each respec-
tive franchise in Major League

like a spoiled child talking, it
made the World Series loss to the
Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001
that much harder.

September 11 and the months
that followed was such a difficult
time in the city’s history. Every-
one in the New York metropoli-
tan area looked towards the Yan-
kees to give us redemption. I’m
not gonna lie, when Luis Gonza-
lez hit the series winning single

Shag me, baby: learning to dance

Why house moms say W&L men need to learn to lead and why the sexy shag has people bopping in the Pavillion

By Mellssa Powell
STAFF WRITER

Phi Delta Theta’s house mom
thinks that Washington and Lee
University guys need to learn
how to dance.

Charlotte Moore, or “Momma
C” as she’s known in the Phi Delt
house, is introducing Lexington
to a unique style of dance: the
shag.

“It’s a beautiful dance,”
Moore said. ‘‘It teaches you how
to lead, and these guys on cam-
pus need to learn how to lead
instead of throwing girls all over
the place—that’s not dancing.”

Teaming up with Beta Theta
Pi’s house mom, Nancy Caban-
iss, Moore is offering shag dance
lessons at the Pavilion to stu-
dents, locals and W&L staff.

The shag, a dance that origi-
nated in the 1930s in clubs in
Myrtle Beach, S.C., was similar
to the jitterbug. However, by the
early 1950s, shag had slowed
down and adopted the tempo of
old rock-n-roll and blues mu-

sic of the times, now known as
beach music. Shag dancing was
one of the first examples of Af-
rican-American culture crossing
into the mainstream as many of
the dance moves were stolen
from segregated dance clubs.

The shag is a handheld dance
with a partner and a male lead.
The majority of the dance is
movement from the waist down,
while the top of the body stays
fairly still.

“Shag is sometimes consid-
ered dirty dancing,” Moore said.
“It can be very sultry, sexy and
very, very smooth.”

The basic steps are vital, and
once they have been learned,
more ﬂare can be added. Moore’s
lessons teach these necessary
steps but she says she is open to
expanding the lessons if people
want to learn more.

And those who become inter-
ested in learning the dance usu-
ally do want to continue taking

Washington Street
gets a tapas twist

New restaurant, Brix, opened for
Parents Weekend and of ers a new

taste for the hungry student

By Katle Boe and Stephanle Hardlman
surr WRITER AND ARTS 3. use EDITOR

Lexington recently welcomed
the addition of a new restaurant
and wine bar, Brix, located at 4
E. Washington Street.

Its opening was aptly timed
with Washington and Lee Uni-
versity’s Parents and Family
Weekend when a special menu
was offered.

Owner Hunter Smith timed
his opening with this weekend
not only to generate traﬂic in the
restaurant but also to provide an-
other venue for parents and their
children to share a delicious
meal.

The cozy and casual space,
seating just 30 people, offers
tapas style dishes and a broad
and affordable wine list, com-
posed of many local wines. A
slightly different brunch menu
is available on Sunday mornings
and afternoons.

ﬂavors of all the dishes are un-
doubtedly very fresh.

One of the best parts about
Brix is that you can choose mul-
tiple dishes~—each dish is served
family style——and avoid the in-
decisiveness some diners face
when looking at a menu with too
many great options.

The service at Brix was near-
ly ﬂawless and the atmosphere
was homey and welcoming. The
size of the restaurant is comfort-
able as well. The outdoor seat-
ing is ideal for a beautiful fall
day. Moreover, all of the food
is served as it is prepared so the
entire meal is staggered. Most
small dishes are in the $10 to
$30 range.

Smith, a native of Richmond,
has worked in the restaurant
business for more than 20 years
in both Charlottesville and Rich-

One staple of the menu is the tiramisu, a

signature dish, that is fantastic and the

perfect ending to a delicious meal. Its made

from marscapone from a local farm.

The menu is also set to
change frequently, giving a nice
change of pace to the average
diner who only has a few res-
taurants in Lexington to choose
from. Brix seems to ﬁll a niche
of simple and classic yet slightly
international cuisine.

One staple of the menu is the
tiramisu, a signature dish, that is
fantastic and the perfect ending
to a delicious meal. It’s made
with marscapone from a local
farm, Broadview Ranch, in the
Shenandoah Valley.

Diners can choose from meat,
seafood, vegetables, bread and
cheese dishes and many other
mouth-watering options.

The scallops and short ribs
were especially delectable as
was the focaccia bread, made in-
house daily. The seafood comes
from a new fresh ﬁsh market
located between Lexington and
Buena Vista.

Brix has also made use of
the space behind the building
by planting an herb garden. The

mond. He and chef Nathan Foun-
tain have created many simple
yet savory entrees for those who
choose to dine at Brix.

Brix welcomes reserva-
tions and walk-ins and is open

from 4 p.m. to midnight and
Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

dancing that you want to do,”
Cabaniss said.

Like Moore, Cabaniss thinks
it’s important for young men to
learn how to lead in a dance. She
tells “her boys” in Beta that it’s
important for them to be able
to dance at social functions like
weddings or even Fancy Dress.

Roanoke area listening to beach
music and her love of the music
generated interest in the shag
dance. Moore also discovered
the dance through the music,
which she ﬁrst heard on a Roa-
noke radio station. Both women
went to shag dancing clubs and
fell in love with it.

Moore often attends shag
dance parties on the weekends
and she loves being able to meet
people from all over the South-
east who share such a unique
common interest.

“We dance from daylight to
daylight,” Moore said.

While Moore and Cabaniss
have much experience with the
female part of the dance, they
had to hire an instructor from
Lynchburg who knows both the
male lead and female part of the
dance to help with the lessons.

Three lessons have already
taken place but students and staff
are still encouraged to start at-
tending. Make-up lessons will be
arranged for those who start late.
Anyone who purchases the six
lesson package for $30 is guar-
anteed six lessons.

Moore and Cabaniss’ contact
information is provided in Cam-
pus Notices as is information on
the times of the lessons. The next

scheduled lesson is on Sunday,
Nov. 15 in the Pavilion and at-
tendees can come as a couple or
individually.

If attending the lessons, make
sure to wear shoes with leather
soles or anything slick. Other
than that, there is no dress code
and any outﬁt is acceptable.

So far, the lessons have had
an attendance of about 10-15
people, according to Moore.
However, more people are al-
ways welcome as Moore and Ca-
baniss wish to share this unique
opportunity with as many in the
W&L community as possible.

“It’s a beautiful dance,”
Moore said. “It’s a sexy dance.
Anyone who sees it danced will
want to learn it.”

_ Volleyball snaps Winning streak

The Generals ended their season this weekend with a 3-2 loss to Roanoke in the ﬁrst round of the ODAC tournament

By Brlelle Welnsteln
surr warren

The Washington and Lee University
volleyball team’s stunning 13-game win-
ning streak came to a disappointing end
as the Generals struggled in the Seahawk
Invitational St. Mary’s Tournament and
dropped their ﬁrst round ODAC match-
up to Roanoke, 3-2.

Traveling to St. Mary’s over Parents
Weekend, the Generals saw their ﬁrst
defeat when they fell to Salisbury 3-0
with game scores of 25-18, 25-17, 25-
19. Junior outside hitter Marah Schmitz
and junior middle blocker Louise Brooks
offset the loss with 11 and 10 kills re-
spectively. Other shining performances
included senior Megan Steinhardt’s 27
assists and ﬁrst-year libero Cameron
Hill’s 14 digs.

The Generals returned to the court
later that afternoon to face Gallaudet
but suffered another setback, falling 3-1
at 25-21, 23-25, 25-20, 25-21. Leading
the offense, junior setter Jenna Finger
left the court with 35 assists and 11 digs

while senior outside hitter Rachael Phil-
lips recorded 15 kills and three blocks.
Sophomore middle blocker Lindsey Dee

The Generals ﬁnished the weekend
with a 3-0 loss to Eastern, falling 25-

unable to pull it together at the confer-
ence playoffs.
Roanoke posted an 18-25, 15-25, 25-

and Brooks added nine and seven kills
to the team respectively.

Back to their usual dominance, W&L
rebounded with a 3-0 victory over St.
Mary’s at 25-19, 25-15, 25-17 the next
morning. Steinhardt led the team on the
offensive front with 41 assists while Hill
took control of the defense with 19 digs.
Schmitz governed the court with 13 kills
while Brooks and Phillips added nine

15, 25-18, 25-12. Steinhardt led with 24
assists while Schmitz contributed eight
kills and ﬁrst-year Bailey Walker con-
tributed seven kills. Hill notched 11 digs
and Finger added nine digs in the loss.
In the ODAC tournament this week-
end, the Generals battled for victory but
fell short to Roanoke College. W&L had
a tremendous season, but coming off the
rough St. Mary’s tournament they were

20, 27-25, 19-17 victory over the No.
2 seeded Generals. The defeat marked
the ﬁrst time since 2000 that Roanoke
has beat W&L and brought an end to
the Generals’ eight-year title-winning
streak.

W&L came out of the gate well aﬁer
winning the ﬁrst two games but was un-
able to keep it up throughout the whole
match.

With the entire gym cheering against
them, the team knew the signiﬁcance for
Roanoke to be playing W&L.

Senior setter Kristi Stevens set the
tone for the match with 59 assists and
12 digs while Hill notched 23 digs. The
offense was led by Phillips with 20 kills,
12 digs and four blocks, Schmitz with
20 kills and 11 digs and Brooks with 15
kills and six digs.

“Even though the outcome wasn’t
what they wanted it to be, the team had
amazing chemistry and is proud of what
they accomplished,” said Phillips.

She said she hopes the returning
players can carry the strides the team
made into next season.

Generals’ football ends season on a disappointing note

W&L fell to Bridgewater 35-34 over Parents Weekend and ended its season with a 23-1 6 loss to Emory & Henry

By Andrew Bonds
STAFF WRITER

The Generals lost a close game to
Emory and Henry 23-16 to close out
their season with a ﬁnal record of 3-7
overall and 2-4 in the ODAC confer-
ence.

Washington and Lee was out gained
on the ground 283-119 as Emory and
Henry was able to slow the traditionally
strong rushing attack.

Led by quarterback Drew Piscopo,
the Wasps also threw for two touch-
downs in Saturday’s contest at Fullerton .
ﬁeld, overcoming an early Generals’
lead with a balanced second half perfor-
mance and effective defense.

The Generals came out of the gates
quickly, jumping to a 3-0 lead on junior
kicker Martin Pritchard’s ﬁeld goal. The
kick capped off a 15-play, 68-yard drive
that seemed to set the tone for the early
stages of the game.

However, the Wasps quickly re-
sponded with a long drive of their own
and Piscopo dived into the end zone on
a two-yard quarterback sneak.

Field Hockey falls to Eastern Mennonite

W&L defeats Roanoke in ODAC quarterﬁnals, then falls 3-] in semiﬁnals

By Stephen Peck
smrr wnmza

It was a tough weekend for the Wash-
ington and Lee University Field Hockey
team as they saw their season and ODAC
championship dreams end at the hands of
the Eastern Mennonite University Lady
Royals.

The Generals defeated Roanoke 4-0 in
the quarterﬁnals of the ODAC tournament
but lost to EMU 3-1 in the semiﬁnals on
Saturday.

Last Tuesday, W&L enjoyed a home
ﬁeld advantage for the ﬁrst round of the
ODAC conference tournament as they
hosted Roanoke College. Going into the

Offensive play stalled in the second
quarter and the Generals and the Wasps
exchanged ﬁeld goals to bring it to 10-6
with only 52 seconds left in the half.

But it was just enough time for the
Wasps to put together a quick four-play
54-yard drive, scoring on a Piscopo
touchdown pass to Jonathan Hawkins
in just 39 seconds. The play gave the
Wasps a 17-6 lead and a surge of mo-
mentum heading into halftime.

The second half continued, as had
much of the game, with little scoring
and a lot of running plays by both teams.
With 6:52 left in the third quarter, Pisco-
po once again found receiver Hawkins
for a 13-yard pass to take the lead 23-6.

The Generals caught a break when
Emory and Henry’s place-kicker, Matt
Turchin, failed to convert the extra
point. Taking the advantage in hand,
W&L then looked to climb back into
the game and responded with a one—yard
touchdown run by sophomore running
back Jonathan Clemo.

“I think it got to a point that we were
tired of losing and made a commitment to
play the whole game without any lulls in
intensity,” Armstrong said of the team’s
shutout streak.

“The coaching staff stepped it up and
really worked with us on defense and
I think it is has made a huge difference.
This year we worked a lot on defense tac-
tics and it made it possible for us to have
these six shut outs.”

With the victory, the Generals moved
on to the conference semiﬁnal game and
were set to face the EMU Lady Royals.

“This team was the best I ’ve ever seen for the pro-

gram, and the group of women were wonderful to

play and train with. I am very disappointed that all

this work didn ’t end how we wanted it. ”

Sallle Armstrong, senlor forward

game, the Generals were riding the mo-
mentum of a dominant ﬁve-game shutout
streak and were sitting pretty as the No.3
seed. They continued using their winning
formula of smothering defense and a re-
lentless offense to secure their win over
Roanoke.

Seniors Alex Caritis (2), Sallie Arm-
strong and Grace McGee all scored in the
contest to run the ﬁnal score to 4-0.

The Generals ﬁred 24 shots on the Ma-
roons’ cage while only allowing ﬁve shots
on their own. W&L goalkeepers senior
Caroline Habliston and ﬁrst-year Kirsten
Kyne did not even have to make a save
as they combined to post the team’s sixth
straight shutout victory.

The last time W&L lost a game, it was a
6-0 shellacking to this same EMU team.

This time around, the Generals looked
to have their revenge on the Lady Roy-
als and plow ahead to the championship
game. Unfortunately it was not to be as
W&L battled hard but came up just short
in a 3-1 defeat.

W&L found themselves in a 2-0 hole
early in the game but ﬁrst-year Katherine
Price found the back of the cage to make
it 2-1 at the half and hopefully spark a
comeback.

EMU proved a bit too tough however
as they scored an insurance goal and al-
lowed only one W&L shot in the second
half.

With 5:24 left in the game, W&L
brought the game even closer, convert-
ing a Pritchard ﬁeld goal once again to
bring the game to 23-16 and even more

win in a hard-fought game.

On the day, Clemo led the Gener-
als with 96 yards rushing and a touch-
down and Hudson rushed nine times for

Jonathan Clemo.‘ 96 rushing yards, one touchdown

Harrison Hudson: 39 rushing yards, 41 receiving yards
Charlie Westfal: I 2 for 28 with 128 yards
Donovan Sawyer: 13 tackles

importantly, to make the battle a one-
possession game. After recovering the
subsequent onside kick, the Generals
looked ready to attack the Wasps’ lead.
But after losing yards on the drive, they
were forced to punt.

Ultimately, the Wasps were able to
run out the clock, pulling out with the

39 yards, adding 41 yards receiving as
well. Quarterback Charlie Westfal went
12-for—28 with 128 yards as the Gener-
als relied mostly on the running game on
Saturday.

The Generals’ defense, led by senior
safety Donovan Sawyer and his 13 tack-
les, had one of their better games to date

statistically.

Although the Generals ﬁnished out
the year on a somewhat disappointing
note, with Saturday’s loss following the
overtime 35-34 loss to Bridgewater over
Parents Weekend, they look to build
from a solid foundation of underclass-
men heading into next year.

With the loss of many multiple-sea-
son starting seniors, there will be some
turnover on the roster next year. Return-
ing their leading rushers, quarterback
and a signiﬁcant part of the defense, the
Generals will certainly have high hopes
heading into next season.

“We had a better game [against EMU]
than last time, but I know we had more
and cou1d’ve beat them,” Armstrong
said. “But they showed up to play and we
couldn’t match that.”

In the blink of an eye, the team’s win-
ning streak, conference championship run
and season were over, but such is life in a
single elimination tournament.

The Generals’ season was a roller
coaster ride of emotion in and of itself.
The team stumbled to a 1-4 start to the
year but slowly climbed their way back
near the top of the ODAC.

Armstrong ﬁnished her illustrious ca-
reer at W&L with a 37-point campaign
and along the way set the school career
scoring record. Soon after she set the
mark, the team suffered a couple tough
losses to EMU and Mary Washington but
it responded with its six-game shutout
streak.

It was disappointing to see such a
magical year end so soon.

“The team this year was the best I’ve
ever seen for the program and the group
of women were wonderful to play and
train with,” Armstrong said. “I am very
disappointed that all this work didn’t end
how we wanted it. I really believe that
this was the team to win ODACs and it’s.
really disappointing that we fell short our
last year here.”

Soccer claims championship

V W&L women is soccer claimed its third ODAC title in school history

It came down to the wire, but the
Washington and Lee women’s soccer team
walked away with an ODAC champion-
ship on Saturday. After drawing 0-0 with
Virginia Wesleyan, the Lady Generals de-
feated Virginia Wesleyan 3-2 in penalty
kicks to claim the championship.

The Generals’ solid backline provided
the ﬁerce defense the team needed to keep
the Marlins at bay, but W&L struggled to
get shots off. The Generals trailed 21-8 to
the Marlins in shot attempts for all 110
minutes of play.

“They’re a team that’s constantly ro-
tating their forwards,” said sophomore
forward Anne Masich. “Everything is
boomed forward to get their shots whereas
we play a more relaxed game.”

In the penalty round, the Marlins struck
ﬁrst, going up 1-0 after a goal from senior
midﬁelder Nicki Mazzoccone. Virginia
Wesleyan looked poised to take control of
the shootout after W&L’s ﬁrst two kick-
ers, senior midﬁelder Maggie Sutherland
and sophomore defender Corinne Smith,
missed their shots.

But W&L, a team that has tasted de-
feat only once this season was not about to
give up its claim to the championship.

The Generals’ next three penalty kicks
had no trouble ﬁnding the net. Sophomore
defender Kat Lawson, sophomore mid-
ﬁelder Page Minton and ﬁrst-year mid-
ﬁelder Ainsley Daigle all scored to give
the Generals the win.

“We never gave up despite missing our
two penalty kicks,” Masich said.

Goalkeeper Emily Leary dominated in
the net for the Generals. The sophomore
played the entire 110 minutes, recording
eight saves and two stops in the shootout
to help deliver the Generals to ODAC
tournament glory.

“I think it’s awesome because this is

something we’ve worked for the entire
season,” Masich said. “This is what our
season is about. Even though we took
the hardest road to the championship, we
stuck it out and we won.”

The win marked a sweep of the ODAC
tournament for the Generals. In the quar-
terﬁnals, W&L defeated Guilford 2-0
recording its 13th shutout of the season.
The win avenged the Generals’ 1-1 tie to

scoring one goal early in the ﬁrst half to
prevent a shutout. But Lynchburg was no
match for the unstoppable W&L defense
as the Hornets failed to score again in the
match-up.

“I’d just say that overall we’ve main-
tained good defense through communica-
tion on the ﬁeld during both games and
practice,” Smith said. “It’s helped us to
keep opponents to scoring a minimum

“I think its awesome because this is something we ’ve

worked for the entire season. This is what our season is

about. ”

Anne Masich, sophomore forward

Guilford just a week earlier. The Gener-
als dominated the offense, leading the
Quakers 21-1 in shot attempts. Daigle and
sophomore forward Allie Espina put up
the Generals’ two goals off assists from
ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Hannah Sackﬁeld and
Masich, respectively. Once again, Leary
took control of the goal for the Generals,
playing all 90 minutes and recording one
save in the shutout.

“The game against Guilford was a re-
ally big game just in terms of coming back
from tying them the weekend before,”
said Smith. “I think of that game as us
taking revenge from the weekend before.
Just keeping them scoreless proved that
we could come back from the upsetting
game.”

The Generals next faced Lynchburg
in the semiﬁnals. The Hornets fared bet-
ter than most of the Generals’ opponents,

number of goals.”

A goal by Sutherland off an assist from
Lawson and a late goal by Espina off an
assist from ﬁrst-year midﬁelder Katie
Howard gave the Generals the 2-1 victory
to send them to the championship game.

The title is the ﬁrst for the Lady Gener-
als since 2003 and only their third ODAC
championship in school history.

“Winning an ODAC championship is
a really big deal and I think especially for
our seniors they know how important and
exciting this is for us,” Smith said. “Go-
ing into the NCAA tournament is always
exciting because you don’t realize how
tough it is to get into the tournament and
how great an opportunity it is.”

The win gives the Generals an auto-
matic bid to the NCAA tournament. Their
ﬁrst opponent has yet to be announced.
