Bass captures F. D.
with 14-vote margin

Swede Henberg swept the Student
Body Presidency by a landslide, and
Marty Bass emerged as Fancy Dress
President yesterday as the Big-4
elections finally came to a close. A
light turnout and another surprisingly
strong write-in campaign by Bart
Faylor served to confuse matters
enormously and bring about an ex-
tremely close vote on the dance presi-
dency.

Henberg. a PiKA from Laramie,
Wyoming, polled 498 votes, 56% of
the total, in defeating Larry Honig,
a KA from Houston. Honig received
only twenty-two votes more than he
did in the primary in garnering 41%
with 361 votes. Write-ins were few
and scattered in this race as only
Charlie Whipple, a Beta with fifteen,
and Steve Sandler, a ZBT with four,
«captured more than one.
| Ihe election of the Fancy Dress
| President was complicated by the
jentry of Bart Taylor as a write-in
| candidate. Bass, a Sigma Chi from
| Little Rock, and Chris Coursen, a
Washington Phi Psi, battled to a near
standoff with Bass winning by a
fourteen-vote plurality. However,
Bass’ percentage of the vote was only
a mere 37.3% and Cousen’s 35.7%
due to the second successive large
write-in for Taylor, a Phi Kap inter-
mediate law student from Woodland
Hills, Calif. Taylor’s vote amounted
to some 27% of the total, and pre-
vented any candidate from even ap-
proaching a majority. Due to a new
constitutional amendment, Bass has
won the position by virtue of polling
a plurality in the run-off, There were
suprisingly no write-ins other than
those for Taylor.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Jay Passavant: a paragon of leadership

An editor much sager and older than this
one once told us that the editorial columns
of a newspaper existed to commend and
condemn, and that each must be done only
after careful thought and evaluation of facts
and required results. It is with this in mind
that we turn from our usual fare of nitpick-
ing and browbeating to commend a student
who has done as much—if not more—for
the student body of Washington and Lee as
has any student in recent history.

Jay Passavant, Student Body President,
has in his term demonstrated the kind of

 

leadership and _ personal integrity that put

him among a select elite of the finest men
to have held his position (or any other).

Executive Committees have been
laggard in championing any
worthwhile cause, contenting themselves with

Past
notoriously

machinations of business as usual until elec-
tion time. But Jay has, through his sense of
leadership, caused this year’s EC to be able
to credit itself with a myriad of noteworthy
accomplishments. The EC-led High School
Orientation Program of the Virginia Associa-

ratified, will expand the state's bor-

“Coeducation” is one of those always-
always words of the genre that can almost
never elicit negative feelings—not quite as
fine a word as “motherhood,” etc., but almost.
The word’s use in recent weeks has brought
upon this quiet campus some lively dialogue,
encouraging editorials, and probably a bit of
wishful thinking. We, too, like to muse about
how it might have been had there been girls
here, available and everything!, our freshman
year. Save on gas, save on unfortunate blind
dates, save wear and tear on ourselves.

And savings is one of the prime reasons
that coeducation is being considered by those
who consider such matters at W&L. Not that
it would save money in the short run to have
girls in attendance——new facilities, or at least
renovations of the present ones, would be
in order, as would time- and fund-consuming
attention to smaller details, such as degree
requirements, the application of rules (all
sorts), and the role of fraternities and, most
likely, sororities,

No, the question of savings arises from a
broader overview which begins with the un-
that within the next
dec ade or two, private institutions especially

mistakable realization

small ones—are going to face monumental
(often devastating ) deficits of funds. To make
simple a complicated explanation, operating
costs per student at private colleges are fis-
ing |) faster than median family incomes are
rising, and, as a result, 2) faster than tuitions
afe OF are able to,

Various educational, fund-raising, and
ON ernmental agen ics have labored on solu

ot

tions to the dilemma the seemingly-im

vithout exception these remedies hinge upon
non-college action (such as universal federal

loan programs, increased business donations,

tion of Student Governments brought young
students from Lexington to a film presenta-
tion and question-and-answer session at W&L.
Jay sponsored the Executive Committee’s first
real student-body blitz session in the “Bitch-
in,” where EC members answered questions
from and heard suggestions made by students.
And though attendance at the first of these
was hardly encouraging, another recently took
place to discuss the Honor System.

This year Jay has led the EC into a review
of Dance Board and Co-op policies with an
eye toward bettering the students’ return on
whatever investments they make. The Student
Civil Liberties Committee, a novelty for W&L,
received the endorsement and assistance of
the president, which is just an indication of
his attention to the desires of all the students,
not just a select group.

Jay has led the EC in establishing a more
viable and logical set of guidelines concern-
ing the Honor System. In the face of attack
or apathy or both, he has capably and ad-
mirably maintained his aplomb and _perspec-
tive temperance to mold harmony on this emo-
tional issue, combining his respected leader-
ship on the EC with the foresight to use
distinguished advisors within the University.

For the first time, the Executive Commit-
tee of the student body has been granted a
non-voting representative to the Board of
Trustees (the Student Body President) and
to the faculty EC (chosen by the president
of the student body). It would not be correct
to ascribe these developments to Jay, but
it would be fair to say that had the EC’s
president been a man of less calibre the
decisions may not have been made this year.

In spite of this impeccable record com-
piled by Jay for himself and for the EC,
no useless idealism has been displayed. Jay
has viewed his role in pragmatic terms, pre-
ferring candor and genuineness to the easy
trap of political drone.

We extend to Jay our sincere congratula-
tions and warmest thanks as members of the
student body for a term well spent, for
leadership superbly demonstrated, and for ac-
complishments impressively tallied.

(and, presumably, greater prestige) to the
school. Something like that.

Whether this is true or not remains at
present an undecided issue. That Yale, Har-
vard, and Princeton have made the decision
to “go co-ed’’(in presidential parlance) is
neither an indication that such action will
produce greater revenues nor an assurance of
its advisability. These schools, to begin with,
will very likely not face a dollar-dilemma as
frustrating as will Washington and Lee.

Certainly there are innumerable advant-
ages, or at least good points, which speak
well for coeducation here. But perhaps the
one that emerges from the ballyhoo most
lauded is All-those-pretty-girls-and-right-here-
too, Not too bad an argument! The rest,
though, are subject to more scrutiny. Whether
or not competition in the classroom will be
increased cannot be decided by argumenta-
tion — if it can be decided at all; should
grades suddenly rise, would this be the result
of heightened competition or increased ad-
mission standards?

Another argument frequently raised in
support of coeducation is that it would create
a more natural atmosphere on campus and
make us as students actually be gentlemen.
Both facets have merit. But just as meritorious
are the counterpoints that education at W&L
is training us to lead lives in a political society,
political in whatever endeavor—business and
industry, education, government, journalism,
science, law. And these fields are, at their
top levels, almost devoid of women. Men
vs. men. And for the “gentlemen’’ part, the
Washington and Lee campus has been, is
now, and will probably continue to be one
of the best-behaved, most gentlemanly camp-
uses in the nation,

All this is Not to say we are opposed to
coeducation at W&L. We prefer to think
our mind is open, that a convincing argu-

ON LONG ISLAND, where I live, |
there are windmills. Perhaps you've
seen them where you live too, They're |
a marvelous creation, turning the air |
into power effortlessly, and without |
thought for good or bad, Power to |
create, power to destroy: the wind- |
mill knows and cares not; an amoral |
machine, but it does its job,

We walk this valley for so few |
days. Awesome creatures we are, you
and I. At night even in the darkest
torments of hallucination, rest as-
sured, rest knowing that Man alone
of all God's children can build a
Tower of Babel. Rest knowing what
man alone can tear assunder utterly
all that He hath wrought.

I know a man slightly. His name
is Jamil Baroody and he is an Arab,
He once said to me, “Come let us
reason together.” He quoted to me
thusly my prophet who is his prophet
who is all our prophet. Here lies the
pivot point.

Isaiah, dead two millenia, Quote
me a prophet of today, if you will.
You can't, I can’t. Reb Hillel, an
aged ancient man was told by a
Roman general with sword drawn to
explain to him the Bible while stand- |

one-legged and said, “Love thy neigh-
bors as thyself.” All the rest is com-

“Good walls (and ABM’s) make good
neighbors,”

Our minds are occupied with sur-
vival. As Nobel Laureate George

| Wald of Harvard recently noted, “I

think what we (adults) are up against
is a generation that is by no means
sure that it has a future.”

The world today, this campus to-
day, is too wrapped up with medium
to spread message. Without cause,
without objective intangiable, we come
like Bierce’s zealots, who, having lost
sight of their goals, redouble their
efforts,

We react in violent anguish to this
experience of treadmill movements:
the S.D.S. siezes buildings and deans,
the blackest black militants would
enclose themselves in cocoons that
even the late, lamented Leander Perez
would never have dreamed of creat-
ing. Denied surety of a future, we
destroy the security of the past. Don't
trust anyone,

We sieze the day. To fill a belly
in justice. Every man’s death—no
matter his belief —diminishes us.
quote (out of context?) Sir Herbert
Lawrence: “The sanctity of human
existence is today too often exaggerat-
ed.” Concern is not with mankind
raised to some higher plateu but with
the good life enjoyed by all men in

that is the total significant accomplish-

Thus the many elements of re-,
action in the state (the Richmond |
newspapers, the Virginia Conserva-|

Politically, Virginia is still in the
Middle Ages.

By a vote of 20-19, the Virginia
Senate rejected a proposed constitu-
tional amendment that would have
expanded the franchise to include 18-
year olds. These 20 staunch defend-
ers of democracy have denied 300,-
000 young adults the chance to
participate in the running of the state
and country. “The Gallant 20” have

To the Editor

Hear the student voice

An Open Letter to the Faculty:
While the merits of the curriculum
revision have been fully discussed,
there seems to be one aspect of this
change which has not been mention-

ed. It seems significant that at a
lime when campus revolution and
students force their demands with

violence, change at Washington and
Lee has been marked by responsible
student action and by cooperation
with the faculty.

Che proposed curriculum revisions
were initiated after careful study by
the Faculty and Student Curriculum
Committee. The Student Executive
Committee then examined these pro-
posals, endorsed them, and informed
the student body as to what these
changes would mean. Finally, in a
record turnout, eighty percent of
the student body voted with the re-

sults being an overwhelming en-
dorsement of the recommended re-
vision, Such responsible action in-

volving the vast majority of the stu-
dent body presents a striking contrast
to such events as last weekend's armed

 

progressive for them. Why 18-year} take-over of an administration build-

olds might even commit the high, mg at Cornell by a minority of

The Richmond
praised the wisdom of the Virginia

Senate in turning down the vote for |

18-year olds, and said that if the
voters of the state really want to
express a preference for broadening
the franchise, they could do so by
electing candidates who favor such a
move. In other words, don't give the
voters a chance to express them-
selves on the issue directly, but throw
im several other issues and make the
results truly inconclusive

| for one plan to vote for every
candidate from Linwood Holton on
down who publicly endorsed the vote
for 18-year-olds, no matter what they
say about the other issues. As Dr
Colvin would say, “Throw _ the
rascals out,’

EC and newspaper polls parallel

each other, point to student trend

In the midst of a great deal of
confusion about where the students |
stand, two polls have been taken in}
the past week to try to answer that /
qiiestion with respect to curriculum
changes. Last Monday, the Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi took an informal poll
of the student body, and received a

surprisingly lopsided balance of opin
ion. Then. on Thursday, the Executive
Committee took a similar poll in the
student body elections after a period

Stickmen beat Maryland;
setback in second match

Over Springs Weekend the varsity
lacrosse squad was visiting two schools
in Maryland. In the first stay, how-
ever, our team wasn’t too nice to its
host as it handed Western Maryland
a 15-1 defeat. The tells the
tale as the Generals almost shut
out the home team.

All the starting attackers broke into
the scoring column. Even most of
the “B” squad members who came
in on. offense talleyed. The wet
weather only contributed to Western
Maryland’s problems,

Only one thing blemished the big
victory for Washington and Lee. De-
fensive stalwart and co-captain Char-
lie Stewart sustained an injury, which

score

may keep him out of action for at
least a week.
After a late afternoon game, Satur-

day morning brought on powerhouse

 

lacrosse

Baltimore. Baltimore faces

 

 

foes such as Maryland and Navy,
two of the finest teams in the nation.

All these factors added up to a 10-3

loss for Washington and Lee Uni-
versity.

Bill Brumback stepped in for in-
jured Stewart and did an excellent

job as Big Blue led 2-0 after the first

quarter, But a defensive lapse in
the second period hurt W&L as the
score stood 6-2 at the whistle. The

final score stood at 10-3 with Balti-
more on top,

Despite plenty of depth, the major
problem remains to be inexperience.
Coach Szlasa could give out nothing
but praise, however, for all of his
team’s play to date.

Saturday the current division leader
and perennial power Washington Col-
lege will host Generals in a

Goshen Classic set for Saturday
with several categories and prizes

Thanks to a week of heavy rains, ;
the water rushing through Gosher
Pass is high and fast, a situation that
is causing tubing afficiados to awail
excitedly this Saturday's running of
the Goshen Classic.

“This is the best I've seen the rivet
in the past three seasons at this time
in April,” remarked Classic director |
Jerry Perlman, “and | would not be
surprised to see records fall in all
three events. The Downriver Grand
Slalom record set last year of 32
minutes flat should be in special
jeopardy.”

Although entries have only begun |
to trickle into Classic headquarters, |
Perlman is confident of a large field, |
and stated that among early contest: |
ants are favorites in all three events. |

Baseball squad
loses on road trip

to H-S tigers 5-1

Washington and Lee’s _ baseball
team simply couldn’t put things to-
gether as it lost Monday 5-1 against
Hampden-Sydney. The Generals were
hitting the ball well but the horse-
hide never dropped in.

Hampden-Sydney started the scor-
ing in the third inning with a stolen
base, a blown run-down, and single.
In the next inning an error with
bases loaded boosted the Hampden-
Sydney total to four runs. A double
followed by a single was the last
scoring that the opponents made in
the fifth inning. Washington and Lee’s
sole run came when co-captain Jim
Wilson singled in a runner.

Jim Wilson did an overall excel-
lent job against Hampden-Sydney. He
got two hits and performed admir-
ably as the the team’s leader, Bob
La Rue turned out a clutch double
while pinch hitting. The pitcher, Gil
Fitzhugh, who went the distance for
W&L also got two hits.

This Saturday Washington and Lee
faces O.D.C. in a double header.

Tennis

The varsity tennis team lost to
the same opponent twice this week—
the rain. Friday's match scheduled
with Randolph-Macon and Wednes-
day’s match against V.C.U. were each
washed out. These matches will prob-
ably be re-scheduled but meanwhile
hopes are high that rain won't stop

it’s the lust for comaraderie and the uninhibit-

even less tangible appeal of a 220-year-old
