Explore Coeducation, Size

Related studies of size and co-
education will be conducted this year
by special University study commit-
tees, President Robert E. R. Huntley
announced ‘Tuesday,

women, or to expand the overall en-
rollment, a step which would involve
increased costs.

The problem of optimum size in-
volves a conflict between the ad-
vantages of opportunities for in-
creased specialization that come with
lageness, and the advantages of close
faculty-student association that de-
rive from smaliness.

“As someone has said, you want
to be big enough to have a_ ball
game and small enough so everyone
can play,” Professor Gunn remarked.

The studies will not touch on the
subject of enrollment in the Schoo!
of Law, the University’s only gradu-
ate division, The law school is con-
ducting its own study of optimum
size.

As a result of largely unplanned
growth, Washington and Lee has
seen its overall enrollment, invouling
both undergraduate and the School
of Law, increase by nearly 400 stu-
dents in the past 10 years. Total
enrollment, including the law school,
was 1,458 at the start of the current
academic year. Most of the increase
has come through reduction in aca-
demic attrition and growth of the
School of Law. A small undergradu-
ate increase resulted in 1965 when the
size of the entering class was raised
by approximately 30.

The coeducation study will parallel
a continuing feasibility study of a stu-
dent exchange program involving
Washington and Lee, four women’s
colleges and three other colleges for
men. “We do not view the coeduca-
tion study as precluding the prospect
of an exchange program,” President
Huntley said.

The president appointed seven fac-
ulty and administration members to
“a committee to study the question
of coeducation. Dr. Louis W. Hodges,
professor of religion, will serve
chairman.

Nine faculty members were ap-
pointed to the committee that will
study the matter of the University’s
future size. In question is whether
undergraduate enrollment should be
smaller or larger than this year's
starting enrollment of 1,272, or sub-
stantially the same. John M. Gunn,
associate professor of economics, will
serve as chairman.

President Huntley said that both
study groups will have student repre-
sentation. Student members to
be named later.

Both committees also anticipate in-
volving alumni in their deliberations
through the medium of the 12-mem-
ber Alumni Board of Directors,
which is elected by the University’s
11,000 living alumni.

Neither committee is charged with
the responsibility of producing a
recommended course of action. In-
stead, the committees are to study
desirability and feasibility of various
alternatives and make reports de-
signed to provide the faculty and ad-
ministration with information that will
be useful in making decisions, the
president noted.

It is hoped that reports from both
committees will be completed by the
end of the current calendar year, an
administration spokesman said. Since
the isues of size of the University and
any possible shift away from single-
sex admissions policies are closely
related, Professors Gunn and Hodges
have indicated that they plan to meet

Dorms Need Refurbishing

Within the past week, the faculty has approved reforms
which will vastly improve the academic and social atmosphere
at Washington and Lee. The academic reforms, which we
discussed last week, will institute a 12-12-6 calendar and liberal
distribution requirements in September 1970. The social re-
forms, passed Monday, will allow alcoholic beverages and
women in the dormitories beginning next September. It is
these latter changes we will discuss at this time.

These latter reforms were first considered by the Student
Affairs Commmittee (SAC) in November following a faculty
resolution to improve living conditions for students in dormi-
tories. The SAC, composed of students, faculty and administra-
tion, visited the dormitories (One member said sarcastically,
“It’s a nice place to visit, but I wouldn’t want to live there.”’),
interviewed freshmen and dormitory counselors, and visited
other campuses to formulate a suitable plan. We feel that the
SAC deserves much praise for the final plan adopted by the
faculty, for it will provide an extension of self-government
in an area in which students should have a voice.

By being more involved in governing their sections, stu-
dents living in dormitories will be given more responsibilities.
For example, the members of each resident section will have
to decide upon and enforce the parietal hours they set for

the section.

There may be several benefits gained from these reforms,
also. They may lessen the pressure put on a freshman to join
a fraternity. By being able to drink liquor and entertain his date
in his own room, he will be provided with a practical al-
ternative (along with the new Student Union) to fraternity
membership and will not be completely excluded from having
a social life. These reforms may also cause dormitory residents
to take better care of their rooms and do less damage to them.

But the largest benefit resulting from these reforms should
come directly from the University. The University has a
perfect opportunity this summer to make the physical condi-
tions in the dormitories more conducive to entertaining guests.
Some suggestions for this general refurbishing program are to
use stronger light bulbs in the halls and rooms and to put
some kind of fixtures over them. Along with this, we recom-
mend repainting the dormitory halls and rooms in brighter
colors to get rid of the gloomy atmosphere which currently
prevails. New window shades should replace the torn, moth-
eaten ones now in the dormitories, and some sort of sound-
proofing should be installed to provide each room with more
privacy. And perhaps some of the old, beat-up desks and chairs
could be replaced with new, comfortable furniture.

This should not be misconstrued as a complete checklist
for refurbishing the dormitories, but it does represent a be-
ginning. The improvements pointed out are sorely needed if
these reforms are to work well. We do not believe that anyone
should be embarrassed to entertain his date in his room be-
cause it is ugly and uncomfortable or because it offers no

privacy.

Writing A University’s History

(Editor's Note: The following are
excerpts from the speech to be
presented by Professor Ollinger
Crenshaw tonight at 8 o'clock in
duPont Auditorium.)

By OLLINGER CRENSHAW
University Historian

When I agreed to undertake the
assignment of writing a history of
Washington and Lee, many years ago,
1 was well aware of the problems
and pitfalls which might confront
the historian, though perhaps not all
all of them. Having been trained in
the historical seminars at Johns Hop-
kins, | planned to apply the critical
method in gathering, organizing, and
writing up my materials.

his being so, and the story of the
rise and growth of what became
eventually Washington and Lee Uni-
versity covering the entire nineteenth
century, with portions of the eigh-
teenth and a half century of the
twentieth, | began a search for what
historians call “source materials”
upon which to build my history.

Unfortunately for me, the official
materials of the era prior to 1770
are thin indeed, and were supple-
mented by investigation in Virginia
manuscripts elsewhere. The trustees’
minutes and papers proved to be re-
warding, and as the years passed
more full and useful. The manu-
script minutes of the faculty did not
begin until about 1842, and _ these,
though full of minutiae (in the tire-
some manner of the petty agenda of
faculty meetings), were of prime im-
portance to me, Other manuscript
collections at Washington and Lee,
such as the invaluable William Flem-
ing Papers, and of course the R. E.
Lee Collection were essential; and
Lexingtonians came forward with
family papers and suggestions,

Although my history was and is in

 

also. found — excellent manuscript
sources at the New York Public Li-
brary, at the Witherspoon Building
in Philadelphia, at Historical Society
of Pennsylvania, and at the Library
of Congress. The Howard-Tilton  Li-

brary at Tulane contained the Wil-
liam Preston Johnston Papers, ex-
cellent on the period of the Lees.

Perhaps I may be permitted a little
excursion into an experience I had
in one of the above mentioned librar-
ies, Which shall remain nameless. I
encountered a series of letters from
a youth who had been a student at
Washington College to a former stu-
dent, addressed from Lexington. |
had never before or since encountered
such a stream of obscenity and
scatology and plain-spoken, perhaps
boastful description of a young male’s
sexual activities, and which resulted
in his getting himself into a serious
scrape. From this, however, the young
man extricated himself, boasting to
his friend the while of accomplish-
ments along this line. Since my book
is not Portney’s Complaint (also pub-
lished by Random House, Inc.), 1

 

could not use this material. The
youth subsequently became a_ lead-
ing citizen of his community, and
a member of the board of trustees
of a college.

Another research jaunt took me to
the Cyrus Hall McCormick Historical
Association Library, a private library
maintained by the heirs of the in-
ventor of the Reaper, Cyrus H. Me-
Cormick, a native of Rockbridge
County, and friend and admirer of
General Lee’s.

Before moving on to other topics,
I wish to remark upon the rather
unsatisfactory condition of manu-
scripts generally at Washington and
Lee when I began my work shortly
after World War Il. The situation has
been improved considerably — since
then, although it is my impression
today that we much need a trained
archivist to take care of the price-
less manscripts in our possession. My
suggestion is that in addition to ade-
quate personnel for this purpose, we
make available a listing and descrip-
tion, if not an indexing, of the manu-
scripts at Washington and Lee.

The Economics Forum is increas-

Another important source of in-
formation about the history of Wash-
ington and Lee is the newspaper,
Fortunately, we have almost complete
files of Lexington newspapers avail-
able, some now on microfilm, from
the 1790's, In this connection, |
journeyed to the American Antiquar-

ian Society at Worcester, Massa-
chusetts, where I found Staunton
newspapers of the 1790's, and of

course to Richmond for the Williams-
burg Virginia Gazette and Richmond
newspapers, But the most complete
sources came from the old Lexington
Union, the old Lexington Gazette,
the Rockbridge County News (since
the early 1880's), and served ephem-
eral newspapers whose lives were
short.

Enough of sources for the present.
A historian must file and organize
his notes, and this I did after re-
turning to full-time teaching, using
the summers often for writing and
occasionally for additional research,
for materials have a way of turning
up—also sometimes after a book has
gone to press. All this caused fre-
quent revisions, and getting the manu-
scripts typed up in preliminary form.

Some years ago President Cole
made contact with the commercial
publisher in New York, Random

House, Inc., and after my manuscript
had been trimmed down to manage-
able proportions with the aid of Mr.
M. M. Kreeger of Tulane, it was
sent for a reading to Mr. Albert
Erskine, Vice President and Executive
Editor of Random House. Mr, Erskine
kindly agreed to read the manuscript,
and reported favorably upon _ it,
whereupon after some further delays
caused by his trip to Europe, the
book finally, after its long journey,
went to the printer, with the result
you have before you. From the sum-
mer of “68 until last February, 1

“Our Lady” Creator

(Editor's Note: Wednesday after-
noon before the opening perform-
ance of the Troubadours’ Produc-
tion of Our Lady, Friday Ring-tum
Phi editorial page editor Lawrence
McConnell talked with one of the
co-authors of the play, Ray Royce.
A freshman from Haverford, Pa.,
Royce spoke of the origin of the
play and his experience in its pro-
duction with Jeb Brown, co-author
of the play.)

Ring-tum Phi: | guess the first ques-
tion | should ask you, Ray, is how
did you get the idea for the play?
Ray Royce: Well, I've been writing a
long time—mostly poetry and stuff—
but I'd always wanted to write a
| play. | met Jeb this summer and got
| to know him fairly well. Then this
| October | guess was the first time We
/Feally talked about writing a play.

We both had the idea that we
wanted to write a play about a girl
; im one of Donovan's songs, “Geral-
dine.” | started out by writing about
my girl—not my girl really—but the
image. That's what we wanted to
create: the ideal woman. | guess
you might say this is a dream play
with song. poetry and dialogue: sort
of a mixture of surrealism and real-
ism. | guess it’s pretty idealistic, but
we tried to put everything into it,
through the poetry that I wrote and
the dialogue that Jeb did.

R-t Phi: How did you go about it?
It must have been had to write it
when you were working with another
person

Royce: Not really. We started out
by drawing up a plan of what we
wanted and | wrote the poetry

dialogue. Then we went back
it after we had finished.

I guess you'd say it was pretty much
a combined effort.

R-t Phi: How long have you been
mterested in drama? Did you
much in high school?

Royce: Oh yeah, all the way through
high school | was interested in it.
I guess | want to be a poet or a
playwright. I'm pretty sure hat Jeb
wants to continue his acting.

R-t Phi: Did you encounter any
trouble in producing it on the Troub
stage? I guess you were pretty limit-
ed by space.

Royce: (Laughier.) Yeah, you could
say that. The main problem was that
Jeb was acting and directing at the
sume time. We both knew what we
wanted, though. We also had a little
trouble finding a leading lady who
could play the part. Finally, we de-
cided on Happy Anderson; | guess
because she had more life at read-
ings than any of the others.

The part must be tough on her
because we have in mind exactly what
we want, and we almost had to mold
the character for her.

| wish that we could have done
more with the lights, too. But then
again, maybe we have put too much
mo it anyway—we tried to make
everything in the play mean some-
thing.

R+t Phi: Do you and Jeb have any
other plans for the play after it is
put on here?

Royce: I'm really not sure what'll
happen to it, Maybe | can get it

Aldridge Named
Assistant Coach

and Lee today an-
nounced the appointment of Norris
r. Aldridge as instructor in physical
education and assistant football coach.

Aldridge is presently a teacher and
head football coach at Natural Bridge
High School, where he was a star
quarterback for three years under
Coach Graham (Buck) Leslie in 1958-
60. Leslie is now the W&L head
coach.

Aldridge’s appointment,
Aug. 1, was announced by Dr.
liam W. Pusey Il, Dean of
College.

As assistant football coach, Ald-
ridge will work primarily with de-
fensive backs. He is filling the vacancy
created when Leslie was elevated to
head coach following the death of
Coach Lee McLaughlin last August.

Football fortunes had waned con-
siderably at Natural Bridge before
Aldridge was named coach in 1966.
Only seven boys reported for his first
practice and the team suffered through
a 1-9 season that year. But in 1967
the team posted a respectable 4-6
record and enjoyed a winning 6-4
mark last fall.

At Natural Bridge, Aldridge
coached baseball and track.

After graduation from Natural
Bridge in 1961, Aldridge continued
his education at the University of
Richmond, where he lettered for three

Captains Decry Coverage

To the Editors of Both Editions
of the Ring-tum Phi:

As co-captains of the W&L base-
ball team, we finally feel compelled
to speak out publicly about the lack
of coverage of our sport by both
editions of the Ring-tum Phi. We feel
that it is the responsibility of the
school paper (a University sponsored
organization) to keep the student body
and faculty informed about other Uni-
versity sponsored organizations of
which the baseball team is most
certainly one.

For a variety of unrelated reasons
including experimentation with print-
ing techniques, fits of temper, and
just poor news gathering, coverage of
sporting events in particular has suf-
fered this year. On Tuesday, April
29, we defeated Lynchburg 11-0. No
mention of this victory was made in
the following Friday's paper. On
Friday, May 2, we split a double-
header with Bridgewater losing the
first game 2-1, but rebounding to take
the second 13-5. The Tuesday edition
of May 6 carried no sports at all
prefering to run a full page ad that
was 80% blank space on what is
usually the sports page.

When the season began, we asked
the staffs of both editions for their
full co-operation and made schedules
and player information available to
them. We were promised assistance
in trying to increase student and fac-
ulty interest in attending our games.
Very little of this help has been forth-
coming. This is most disappointing in
that we feel that we have done our
part to bring recognition to Washing-
ton and Lee this season. The nine
victories we have amassed to date
represent the most wins by a W&L
baseball team since 1952. This fact
plus our overall improvement in the
last two years has prompted the daily
papers in Roanoke, Richmond, and
Lynchburg to ask that we send them
the results of every game. Television
stations in Richmond and Roanoke
have made similar requests, This
demonstrated interest of neighboring
mass media makes us wonder why
the Ring-tum Phi, our school paper,
considers us to be so unimportant.

CAC Opens Today At Centre
Four Sports Compete For Bells

Washington and Lee athletes will
wind up their seasons in four spring
sports today and tomorrow in pursuit
of the College Athletic Conference
championships at Centre College in
Danville, Ky.

The Generals currently are tied
for second in the overall CAC point
standings for the President’s Trophy,
symbolic of the league championship.
Southwestern of Memphis, champion
in basketball and co-winner with
Centre in football, has a command-
ing 20-point lead and is a strong
favorite to win the title.

Southwestern has 672 points to
471% for both Washington and Lee
and Centre. Washington University of
St. Louis is still in the running with
40 points, while last-place Sewanee
(22%) would need a miracle in the
four sports (baseball, track, golf and
tennis) to win the chamionship.

Champions in each sport are award-
ed 25 points, the runners-up 20, third
15, fourth 10 and fifth 5.

Washington and Lee is the de-
fending overall champion. Southwest-
ern has won one title, while Wash-
ington University captured the first
four crowns after the league was
formed in 1962.

The Generals appear strong in base-
ball and tennis and will be contend-
ers in golf. But they will be hard-
pressed in track, where they are
strong in field events but weak in
running events.

WAL boasts three conference track
champions in Mike Neer (high jump),
Mike Carrere (javelin) and Bill Kahn
(long jump). Neer set the CAC record
last year with a jump of 6-6% and
has cleared 6-8 in numerous meets
this year. Carrere threw the javelin a
record 181 feet last year as a fresh-
man and Kahn won the long jump
at 22 feet, 34-inch.

The Generals also will be strong
in the discus, where Doug Deaton has
broken his own school record three
times this year, the latest a toss of
146 feet, six inches,

 

W&L’s tennis squad has won the
CAC title for the past two years,
The General netmen will be led by
returning conference singles champ-
ions Don McClure and Bill Gatlin,
and doubles winners Tommy Rueger,
Tom McJunkin and McClure. Rueger
is no. 1 and the team captain.

The Generals netters own only a
6-5 record to date, but against much
tougher competition than previously.
Three of the other four teams all
boast winning records, led by South-
western’s 13-4 and Washington 11-5.
Sewanee, runner-up to W&L last
year, is 7-5,

WA&L’s baseball team has been a
pleasant surprise this spring and
boasts a 9-7 record. Top pitcher and
slugger Tim Mitchell, injured most
of the season, is now fully recovered.
He and fellow co-captain Jim Wilson
both made the all-CAC team last
year.

Mitchell has a 3-1 won-lost record
with a fine earned run average of
1.62. He’s also hitting .272 at the
plate. Gil Fitzhugh has posted a 4-3
pitching record with a 1.91 ERA, in
addition to being the top slugger at
327.

Wilson is batting .298 and Scotty
McChrystal is hitting .295 with 19
runs batted in and three home runs.

Golf coach Cy Twombly’s chat ges
are assured of a winning season with
a current 5-3 mark. The Generals,

 

runners-up to Sewanee last year, are)

paced by no. 1 Ken Carter, a sopho-
more, and Bob Mathews, who fired
a 70 in his last outing.

Stickmen Lose To Towson 8-6;
Face Tough Duke Team Here

In its game last Saturday, the La-
crosse team went down at the hands
of a tough Towson State College
team. This was a division game for

the Generals, and Coach Szlasa prais-
ed his team saying they played better
than they had at any time this season.
The final score was 8-6.

WAL had a strong opening in the
game, with the half time score being
5-3 in our favor. The Generals were
ahead until ten minutes were left in
the game. It was then that Towson’s
ace attackman, Tim Mahoney, broke
loose. His total output for the day
was three goals and three assists.

Coach Dick Szlasa had praise for
his tripartie defense of Ned Coslett,
Tommy Smith and Bill Brumback. He
gives them the credit to holding down
Towson’s potent attack in the first
three quarters. Szlasa also feels that
goalie Bill Ingersoll is improving with
each game and that as he improves,
so will the team. He said that the
defense and the goalie have jelled into
a fairly cohesive unit.

The midfields also drew praise from
Szlasa. The first midfield of Whit
Morrill, Bart Goodwin, and Jay
Meriwether played well as usual. The
second midfield of Clark Carter, John
Thomas, and Todd Morrill played its | ®
best game of the season according to
Szlasa. The midfields did most of the
scoring.

The attack was disappointing due to
its inability to penetrate the Towson
defense. Scott Neese was able to
score but the penetration by the at-

|tack ended there.

The early line on the Spring Sports |
Festival at Centre has it that South-|
western’s big lead will be too much |

to overcome.

CIRCLE K

The loss to Towson makes our
record 1-6. Coach Szlasa feels that
there are some boys on the team who
deserve post-season recognition, and

‘hopes that this record will not keep

Tradition-minded Washington and
Lee University hopes history repeats
itself when the Generals meet Duke
University in lacrosse here Saturday.

For the Blue Devils have won only
once since 1962 in their annual meet-
ing with W&L.

Based on records and recent per-
fomances, however, the visiting Duke
stickmen will be favored. The Blue
Devils own a 5-4 record, including
a win over a tough Air Force team,
while W&L has had its troubles in
a 1-6 season.

W&L does have creditable offense,
led by freshman attackman Scott
Neese and midfielde Jay Meriwether.
But the Generals are weak on de-
fense.

Duke will counter on offense with
All-America Steve Sachs at attack and
Chuck Clark at midfield. The Blue
Devil co-captains lead an offense
which is averaging nine goals a game.
