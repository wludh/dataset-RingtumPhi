Faculty Approves Majority Pro

 

Atwood To Replace
Retiring Dean Adams

Dr. Lewis W. Adams will retire
July 1 as Dean of Washington and
Lee University’s School of Commerce
and Administration and he will be
succeeded in that position by Dr.
Edward C. Atwood Jr., the Uni-
versitys Dean of Students.

Both changes were announced
Thursday by Robert E. R. Huntley,
University president.

Dr. Adams, 65, is only the fourth
dean in the School of Commerce

and Administration’s 64-year history.
He has served as dean for 20 years.

 

Dean Adams

Although stepping down as dean, he
will continue to teach in the School.

Dr. Atwood, 46, has been the Uni-
versity’s Dean of Students since 1962.
He also will continue to be a pro-
fessor of economics after assuming
his new post.

“A few words cannot even suggest
the magnitude of Dean Adams’ ac-
complishment for Washington and
Lee during his years here,” President

i.

 

Dean Atwood

Huntley said. “The School of Com-
merce and Administration, as the
result of his wise guidance, has de-
served and achieved national recogni-
tion for its strong faculty, high
standards and balanced curriculum.

“That a man of Dean Adams’ tare
ability should have brought to this
school his professional career and
his personal devotion is indeed a
major tribute to Washington and
Lee. lt is gratifying to know that he
will continue as an active member
of the faculty in the years ahead.”

A native of Andrews, N.C., Dean
Adams initially joined the Washing-
ton and Lee faculty in 1926 as an
instructor if economics, a posilion
he held for three before
cepting employment elsewhere
1940, he rejoined the University
an assistant professor of economics
in February, 1949, he became a full
professor and he was named Dean of

pany in New York, Dr. Atwood re-
turned to Washington and Lee in
1962 to become Dean of Students,

The School of Commerce and Ad-
ministration is the smallest of such
schools in the nation to earn national
accreditation from the American As-
sociation of Collegiate Schools of
Business. Only about 130 out of 600
schools in the nation have member-
ship in the association.

Dean Adams earned his bachelor
of science degree at the University of
North Carolina in 1925, and his
doctorate at Cornell University in
1949. He was an instructor at Cornell
in the 1925-26 and 1930-31 academic
sessions, |

He joined the New York firm of
Holsapple & Co. as a security analyst |
in 1933 and was appointed manager |
of the company’s statistical depart-
ment in 1937.

During World War Il, Dean Adams
served as administrative officer for
the Naval Training School at Harvard
University and as an executive office:
of the Field Administration Division
of the Bureau of Naval Personnel in
Washington, D.C. He received com-
mendations from President Truman

(12-12-6 Plan
Also Ratified

In a two-and-a-half hour special
meeting yesterday, the faculty voted
to accept the majority method of
reducing distribution requirements
and a calendar change incorporating
a short term at the end of the school
year, Both programs are due for
implementation by the fall of 1970,

Both the Majority and Minority
plans, as well as proposed calendar
changes and other proposals yet to
be voted upon, were presented to the
faculty some time ago by the Faculty
Curriculum Committee and were
aired by the Faculty Discussion Club
prior to the vote yesterday afternoon,

The committee, chaired by Dr.
Henry S. Roberts, supported the need
for a more flexible curriculum largely
on the basis of the need to attract
good students on a continuing basis.
A majority of the committee, as well
as of the students voting in a recent
referendum, supported the plan which
would most liberalize distribution re-
quirements. The students also sup-
ported changing the calendar to two
12 week terms with one 6 week
term in the spring, though by a
slimmer margin.

The Majority Plan

The plan finally adopted was the
one accepted by a majority of the
members of the committee, except
that journalism courses were deleted
from the list of social science require-
ments. Under this plan, the student
will have to fulfill 36 hours of dis-
tribution requirements, six from each
of four divisions and 12 at large,
in order to graduate.

Those divisions include
Division I—English, French, Ger-

man, Greek, Latin, Russian, and
Spanish:
Division H—Fine Arts, History,

Philosophy, and Religion;

Division Hl—Biology, Chemistry,
Geology, Mathematics, and Physics:

Division IV—Economics, Political
Science, Psychology, and Sociology-
Anthropology.

A maximum of 12 hours from each
division may be counted toward dis-
tribution requirements.

Minority Plan Less Flexible
The rejected Minority Plan te-
quired the student to take a mini-
mum of 46 hours, distributed in the
following manner:
18 hours in Division I, includ-
six in English and completion of

a.
ing

the second year of any other langu-
age;
b. 12 hours in Division Il, with

courses taken in at least two of the
departments listed;
c. 10 hours in Division Il,

THE RING-TUM PHI

A New Image for WEL

The faculty’s decisions to revise the academic calendar
and to modify the distribution requirements must be consid-
ered the most revolutionary changes Washington and Lee
University has made in many years. Undoubtedly, these re-
visions will cause prospective and current students alike to look
at W&L as a dynamic, innovative university rather than as
a sleepy, unimaginative bastion of higher learning not unlike
high school.

The benefits which will be derived from these new proposals
have been stated many times before and do not bear repeat-
ing. However, it must be noted that these innovations will
give more responsibilities to both the students and the faculty.
Students will have to work harder because the course loads
will be condensed (each course will be taught in 12 weeks
rather than 15 weeks). At the same time, all departments will
have to reevaluate their courses and teaching methods con-
tinually in order to attract more students.

With students working harder at courses and independent
projects they have chosen for themselves (and not been
forced to take) and with each department striving to offer more
relevant and updated subjects, Washington and Lee will come
closer to fulfilling the true objective of any college, i.e., inspir-
ing students to learn for the sake of learning rather than to
learn for the sake of grades.

All we can do is thank the faculty for bringing Washing-
ton and Lee back into touch with modern educational stand-
ards. The only thing we regret is that we will not be here to
reap the benefits.

Our April 25th Silence

Throughout this year this edition of the Ring-tum Phi has
been interested in the problems of the city of Lexington. We
have done this because we feel that, as W&L students, we have
a moral and social responsibility to help those who are less
fortunate. We feel that students should be made aware of these
local conditions and correct them whenever injustices are
detected.

Last week the Ring-tum Phi learned about a case of alleged
racial discrimination concerning a W&L student and his date
in a local establishment. We were about to expose this incident
in the April 25 issue when we discovered some of the facts
were contradictory. Since we did not want to risk injuring
the integrity of either party and because it was too late to
omit the story, we suspended publication. This act was decided
upon solely by the editorial staff without outside pressure of
any kind. Since last Friday, the true facts have been de-
termined and the parties involved have reached an under-
standing.

Even though we did not publish the story, our intent to
print it has brought the desired results. We have received a
guarantee from the owner of the establishment in question
that it will no longer follow selective discriminatory practices
and will serve anyone at any time regardless of his race, creed
or color. In addition, we were guaranteed that actions of
employees concerning this problem will also be watched closely.

We sincerely regret any inconveniences we may have caused
by not publishing last week. However, we made what we
considered to be the best decision for everyone involved, and
we would do it again under similar circumstances.

Dance Plans--R.LP.

“Dance Plans, Rest in Peace! Because if nothing is done
to make you more attractive to students, you will die a fast
death.”

Allow us to explain why this is the case. It is actually just
a simple math problem. We currently pay $40 for a Dance
Plan, which entitles us to attend the concerts of four party
weekends. This means that we pay $10 for entertainment
for each of the weekends (or $9 apiece if we “take advantage”
of the special price of $36 offered during the summer). If a
Dance Plan holder decides not to remain on campus for one
of the weekends, he pays the equivalent of over $13 for each
weekend's entertainment.

The above prices also include admission for the Dance Plan
holder's date. However, if for some unforeseen reason a person
doesn't have a date, the average price per concert for the holder
of the Dance Plan is twice the amount he would have to pay
if he could buy individual tickets.

Now let's look at the situation for Springs Weekend.
Tickets for each of the concerts were sold for $2.50 apiece.
This means that anyone (not just a W&L student) and his
date could attend the Friday and Saturday night concerts for
$10—the exact same amount that a Dance Plan holder had
to pay for the weekend concerts. In addition, the holder of
the Dance Plan may have even paid more if he missed one
or more of the concerts of Openings or Fancy Dress.

It is apparent that students who do not own Dance Plans
got a good deal Springs Weekend, whereas those who bought
the Dance Plans (to save money, we were told) were gypped.

We don’t know who determined the price for the indi-
vidual tickets for Springs Weekend. But one thing is certain.
The Executive Committee or the Dance Board will have to
guarantee the student body that if individual tickets are sold
for individual concerts, they will cost substantially more than
the equivalent price for a Dance Plan holder. Otherwise, there
will be no advantages to owning Dance Plans, and they will
disappear. As Dance Plans disappear, so do good entertainers

Letters to the Fditor...

The Honor System
Needs A New Name

To the Editor:

On Wednesday, March 19, the
Executive Committee had a Bitch-In
on the Honor System which a hand-
ful of students attended, At the meet-
ing several changes were discussed.
Out of all this, | have only one small
modification to suggest.

My proposal is simple, necessitat-
ing only a change of title. I think for
honesty’s sake that the name of the
Honor Code should be change to
the Code of Minimal Good Behavior.

Why? Because there is no “Honor”
System under either the present pro-
cedures or any modification suggested
of it. Under the present system if
a person is caught cheating on his
age at the ABC store, he would prob-
ably not be convicted of an honor

 

violation. Under any of the proposed
systems, he unfortunately would not
be.

“Why should he be?” you cry.
Should he be kicked out of school
for a little thing like that?” No, I
reply, but under no definition could
you call his action honorable (unless
you could count honor among
thieves). He may be up with the
times and just doing what everyone
else is and perhaps this makes his
action less offensive, but it does not
make it honorable. His action could
not fall within an “Honor” Code.

The new proposals and the old
methods of enforcement assume that
the person has been dishonorable;
they just want to know if he was
dishonorable enough to be expelled.
And of course these liberalizers are
completely correct, but let’s be fair
to the few starry-eyed high school
seniors who find the word honor an

 

attraction. Open their eyes, do not
let them think people still aspire to
ideals.

And we certainly would not want
to discourage those academically quali-
fied people from attending simply be-
cause the word honor repels them.
We must let both groups know that
as long as you are averagely dis-
honest, you can get by. By chang-
ing the Code’s name we could give
these people notice and at the same
time accurately define the system we
live under.

Nation Attacks Hamill’s Arguments

 

—

A Sane Look at Coeducation

By MIKE NATION

I have a strong bias against articles
in reply to articles. However, Jim
Hamill’s column on coeducation in
a recent paper cannot go without
comment because it expresses the
feeling of a great many students.

The purpose of my article is not
necessarily to advocate coeduction.
Rather, it is to appeal for the use
of reason and intellectual detachment
in dealing with this emotionally over-
toned issue,

Mr. Hamill, lamentably, must
serve as an example of how not to
discuss coeducation. His facts are
often inaccurate or irrelevant. The
critical issues are glossed over by un-
warrented assumptions and an ad-
mittedly impressive rhetoric.

First, the facts. Mr. Hamill tells
us that W&L’s graduate school en-
trances will drop if coeducation is
instituted, Statistics of coed liberal
arts schools in terms of percentage
of graduates entering post-graduate
education don't substantuate this. A
sampling reads: Carleton 70 percent,
Earlham 45 percent, Berea 45 per-
cent (has more females than males),
Ripon 50 percent, Oberlin 65 percent.
It appears, rather, that the affinity for
post-graduate study is peculiar for an
individual school and not a factor of
seX mix,

The same point can be made con-
cerning attrition. (Just as an aside,
what does Lindenwood College, a
midwestern, denominational girls
school of litthe academic repute have
to do with coeducational W&L?) At-
trition rates seem also to be indigen-
ous to a given school. Additionally
Washington and Lee's attrition rate
has been about 30 percent, contrary
to Mr. Hamill’s implication of a much
lower rate.

Another inaccuracy concerns edu-
cation courses. Hamill writes of a
preponderance of education cours-
es in girls’ schools in general is more |
or less irrelevant to a coeducational |
situation. An examination of coed |
schools reveals no such large educa- |
tion departments.

 

| ing on new, attractive dorms.

Secondly, even the four surround-
ing girls’ schools have no major in
education and no large curriculum
in this area. Hollins has one in-!
structor and four courses.

More substantively, Mr. Hamill |
makes some questionable assump- |
tions. First, he assumes that the cur-|
rent situation in many areas is static
and apparently correct. He does not)
question whether it is wrong and|
deleterious to arbitrarily exclude
women. He does not question, in more
general terms, the question of mascu-

 

linity as exhibited here. He does not
question whether its concept is dying,
e.g. whether more and more women
will be entering heretofore nearly ex-
clusively male fields.

Further Mr. Hamill assumes that
coeducation would come with reten-
tion of current size, Conversation with
knowledgable faculty and administra-
tion reveal this assumption to be
unwarranted,

Mr. Hamill asserts that coeducation
would result in gross curriculum

illegal. The possession of marijuana
is a

federal crime involving upon
conviction a sentence in a federal
jail.

Many students know of friends who
have smoked “grass” and, also, know
of some of the raids that have been
held on campus (raids by school
officials not federal narcotic agents).
There are probably narcotic agents in
the Lexington area keeping surveil-
lance,

Continued use by students, it seems
to me, is asking for more and more
trouble. Sooner or later federal nar-
cotic agents (not school officials) will
be conducting raids and many of the
W&L’s gentlemen will wind up in
federal penitentiaries. When you
smoke that “mary jane,” think about
the possible consequences to W&L’s
reputation and your own. This is not
to say pot heads do not appear on
other campuses. However, I think it
is in W&L’s tradition as gentlemen to
uphold the law and to not continue
this open violation of the law,

On Campaign Posters
To the Friday R-t Phi Editor:

I decline to comment on the lack
of interest in the current elections
for student body officers. 1 would,
however, wish to comment on our
“tradition” of multi-colored campaign
posters. Every spring this campus
takes on the appearance of a cheap
bazaar when posters of all sorts are
tacked, taped, or nailed to anything
or everything within reach. The news-
paper does a fine job of informing
the students of the candidates. Do we
really need all those posters? I think
not, Brandon C, Martin, °69

 

The Freshman’s Dilemma

By DAVE OLSON |
This time every year just about
every freshman starts thinking about
transfering or leaving W&L. He is
dissatisfied with the lack of women
on campus, with the intellectual at-
mosphere, with the overly strict dorm
regulations and the freshman year in
general. What can be done to cor-
rect this?

The biggest problem is the fact
that the freshmen, for the entire first
year are set off in their corner of
the campus with very little contact
with upperclassmen. Even with fra-
ternities, most of the year is spent
with freshmen in the dorms and in

class. This is probably the major
contributing factor to freshman
alienation. This isolation not only

makes the freshman year unpleasant
but also leads to apathy later in a
student’s time at W&L. The way this
happens is that when a_ student
finishes his first year he is already
dissatified with archaic distribution
requirements and general campus dis-
unity and these problems seem so
overwhelming that he is resigned to
three more years where there is no
real way to change. The answer to)
the problem of freshman alienation.
and student apathy in general is an}
extensive building program  center-

 

 

 

What this will do is bring upper-
classmen back to the campus. These
new dorms must be attractive, with
suite set-ups, liberal parietal hours
and no liquor regulations. They must
be attractive to upperclassmen so that
they will want to live in them. In-
stead of the students only coming
to campus to go to class, they will
be living and eating on campus. This
will bring together the entire student
body. The freshmen will have greater
contact with upperclassmen and up-
perclassmen will be brought together
themselves. Now the majority of
upperclassmen live in apartments
spread all over the county.

The entire student body is together
only on rare occasions and then for
only short periods of time. There is
no interaction, no intermingling and
no conversation and exchange of
ideas between students save those in
the same fraternity and that group is
a restricted group. The key to in-
creased intellectuality and the elimina-
tion of student apathy on this campus
is this increased intermingling of stu-
dents. Dormitories close to campus
would be the best way for the uni-
versity to bring students back to
campus and the increased interaction
of students and the resultant exchange
of ideas

 

student concern, and

intellectuality.

With the upperclassmen back on
campus and the atmosphere of the
campus changed by the dorms, the
freshman year will not only be tol-
erable but very possibly enjoyable.
If the proposed curriculum changes
pass next month the freshman year
will lose some of its dullness and
the freshmen should become more
interested in their courses; and with
interested students, the faculty will
not dread teaching freshmen.

With these changes and the addi-
tion of upperclass dorms, the fresh-
man would not only enjoy his first
year but would be excited about the
years to come at W&L. Upperclass
dorms would not only aid the fresh-
men in getting to know the upper-
classmen but would also help the
campus as a whole, restoring campus
unity, undermining apathy and in-
creasing contact and the exchange of
ideas between students which would
lead to a much more intellectual at-
mosphere than exists now, With a 2.2
million dollar gym going up I would
suggest that upperclass dorms would
not only be an addition to the physi-
cal beauty of the campus but might
also do more for the student body

“Sister George” Lives On

By ROBERT J, BAROODY

!
The absurdity of the “teaser film” |
Romeo and Juliet only reached
me halfway through the State's pres-
ent offering, The Killing of Sister,
George. “No ordinary love story,”
booms the narrator, assuring Us that
only in Shakespearean Verona did six-
teen year olds get in bed together,

Ridiculous! Whether the subject is
a homosexual Sergeant. pubescent
lovers, or two raving lesbians, when
have you ever seen an “ordinary
love story” on that great silver sereen
that (just think of it) automatically
inflates Susannah York's left breast
io Over Sixty times nomal size
Are love stories possible ina medium
that overwhelms us with sexuality?

In any case, both of Lexington’s
movie theatres seem to be profitably
sliding down into the pit of sex
plicitness, with the Lyric’s The Games

picture to appear inside the city limits
within ten days. But never fear; next)

The Killing of Sister George, |

in the film, and is well complemented
by the aforementioned Miss York,
who gives a wonderfully expressive
performance as George's roommate,
Alice “Childie” McNaught. Aside

BBC executive, is rather inadequate

S ster George is the television name

partner is deserting her for another
companion. Equally alarming is the
fact that George is scripted to meet
her doom immodestly astride $5 cc's

| Neer Sets State Jump Record;
, Generals Drop Two Close Meets

By WALT POTTER

Washington and Lee’s cindermen
fell before the suprising Hampden-
Sydney thinclads in a home meet
Wednesday afternoon, 77-68. Com-
ing up with surprises in the weight
events and an outstanding perform-
ance by Dudley Patterson, Hampden-
Sydney clinched the meet in the last
event, the mile relay. Going into the
mile relay W&L had a chance to win
after gaining six points in the late fin-
ishing high jump, as Mike Neer took
his usual first place with 62” effort,
but stellar performances by Neer and
Hinkle were not enough to pull out
the tight meet.

Hampend-Sydney’s performance in
the weight events was the key to
breaking W&L’s usual predominance
in field events, H-S'’s Bob Unrue
captured both the discus and the
shot-put as Ben Williams and Doug
of W&L were second and
third respectively in the shot and H-S
swept the discus, In the javelin Mike
Carrere captured his fifth consecutive
dual meet victory with a toss of 168°
2” and Jay Passavant took third, but
H-S broke up the usual W&L sweep
of the event by taking second place.

WA&L’s field prowess returned in
the other events. Bob Faust captured
the pole valut again by catapulting
himself over the 12° mark, with Tom
Billups bagging a second for the Gen-
erals. Bill Kahn got his fifth con-
secutive long jump victory with a
leap of 21°41” as Mike Neer added
to his laurels by taking second in this
event. Neer also captured second in
the triple jump with Kahon éarning
third place.

Hinkle led the way for the Gen-
erals in the running events. He cap-
tured both the 440 yard dash (51.9)
and the 220 yard dash (23.1) and
anchored the 440 yard relay team
to victory (45.0). Don Marshall took
first in the 120 yard high hurdles in

 

16.1, and Bruce Wilsie was first in
the 100 in 10.4,
In the distance events Patterson

gave W&L a hard time. He won the
880 and then beat W&L’s outstand-
ing distance man Harry Zeliff in both
the mile and two mile, winning the
mile and finishing in a veritable tie
with teammate Martin Willis. Willis
also was second in the mile to force
Zeliff down to third in both events.

Thursday afternoon saw the sec-
ond defeat in two days for the
| W&L thinclads, as Old Dominion won
| by a score of 79-67. Both meets were
very close.

WAL’'s strength in the field events
waned for the second day as Old
Dominion swept both the

 

 

shotput |

Washingion and Lee University
Bonkstore

and pole vault. In the javelin, Mike
Carrere placed first and Billy Ball
place third for W&L. Doug Deaton
captured a second in the discus for
the Generals’ only place.

The high jump was a surprise, as
Mike Neer, who in the last week has
been in five meets, came out with
only a tie at 68” with his OD
adversary. On Monday, Mike captured
the State high jump crown with a
leap of 6'7%, a new state record.
Last weekend Mike jumped 6'734” at

the Penn Relays. Today he is compet- |

ing in the Quantico Relays in Quan-
tico, Virginia.

The broad jump was captured by
Bill Kahn for his sixth consecutive
win. John Glace placed third in the
broad jump but placed first in the
triple jump, with Rob Faust close
behind in second. In the 120 yard
high hurdles, Drew Thomas and Don
Marshall captured second and _ third
respectively.

In the sprints W&L did fairly well.
Wilsie took the 100 yard dash in
10.5 with Baker taking third. Sam
Hinkle took first in the 200 yard
dash with Baker bagging another
third. Hinkle placed second in the
440 for the only place in that event
for the Generals.

The 880 and mile runs were weak
spots. Steve Darsie captured a third
in the 880, with OD completely

sweeping the mile. In the two mile
Harry Zeliff, ace distance runner,
took first with the other two places
going to OD.

Ihe two teams split the relays, OD
picking up five points in the mile
relay with W&L coming in second.
(This is comparable to Hubert
Humphrey saying, “Well, I ran sec-
ond anyway.”) W&L captured the 440
relay to close out the meet.

Tennis Team
Loses to U.Va.

By MIKE HOSFORD
Sports Editor

On Wednesday morning the Wash-
ington and Lee tennis team suffered
defeat at the hands of a very strong
U.Va. team by a 9-0 score at Hot
Springs, Va.

Keeping in mind the schedule that
the tennis team has taken on, there
can only be the highest praise for
this dedicated group. Captain
Rueger lost only his second match of
the year

Golfers Play
Tough Schedule

This was an active week
W&L golf team as the
participated in two matches.

Monday, the General — golfers
travelled to the famous Cascades
courses in Hot Springs for the State

for the
linksmen

Golf Tournament. A_ strong V.P.I.
team walked away with the team
honors. The W&L team finished a

strong fifth. Ken Carter led the team
with a 79-79-158 over a very tough
thirty-six holes. The golfers finished
in fifth place last year.

Wednesday, the Generals traveled
to Roanoke, where, in a dissappoint-
ing match, W&L lost to Roanoke
College for the first time ever in this
sport. This loss dropped the team’s
record to 4-3. Jim Gordon’s 78 was
the low round of the day, as he
and Bob Matthews were the only
Generals to win their matches. The
Roanoke course was a new tough
one, measuring over 7,000 yards.

rhis afternoon the Generals travel-
ed to Staunton to meet Bridgewater
College for a 1 p.m. match. After
this afternoon's match, the golfers
meet Lynchburg College Monday in
a home match.

author George

English = mystery
Symons will speak at
Lee next week on
Orwell.

Besides more than 20 mystery and
crime novels of his own, Symons
reviews other crime novels regularly
for the London Sunday Times,

He will lecture at 8:15 p.m. Tues-
day (May 6) in duPont Auditorium,
His appearance is sponsored by the
University’s Seminars in Literature
program and is open to the public.

In addition to his mysteries, Symons
has writen a number of historical
and critical studies, among them “A.
J. A. Symons” (1950), “Charles
Dickens” (1961), “Thomas Carlyle”
(1962), “The General Strike” (1957),
“The Thirties” (1960) and “The De-
tective Story in Britain” (1962),

He also has published a book of
poems, “The Second Man” (1944)

NOTICES

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body is presently accepting
applications for membership, includ-
ing chairman, on each of the follow
ing student committee: Student Con-
trol, Cold Check, Assimilation,
Library, and Curriculum. Applications
should be submitted to Chuck Dob-

either between the two 12 week
semesters or after them, in the spring.
Integral to both proposals was the
reduction of graduation requirements
from 123 to 115 hours. The normal
course load for the 12-week semesters
will be 12 credits, 3-6 for the short
term,

Both plans put first term exams
before Christmas. The 12-12-6 plan,
which was adopted, ends the second
term just before spring vacation, The
year will end at approximately the
same time, and students will be re-
quired to register for all three terms,

rhe curriculum changes have been
submitted to an Implementation Com-
mittee, which is composed of the
membership of the Faculty Curricu-
lum Committee, to make preparations
for implementation of the innovations
by the fall of 1970. Most of the
work will have to be completed nearly
a year in advance in order for the
1970 catalogue to include the changes.

Parietals and Unit of Credit

The faculty will convene for their
regular meeting Monday, and among
the items for consideration is the
