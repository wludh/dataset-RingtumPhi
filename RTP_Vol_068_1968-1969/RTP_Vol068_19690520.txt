LANE WILL
HEAD NEW
CENTER

1964 Graduate

LED CLASS, DANCE
BOARD AND PAPER

Washington and Lee will welcome
back one of its sons this fall when
Ken Lane, class of 1964, returns to
Lexington to direct the University’s
new Student Center. While the Center
will not be opened until September,
Mr. Lane will be on hand during
July and August to organize the activi-
ties of the Center and plan for the

year ahead,

Mr. Lane brings with him a famili-
arity with almost every campus
activity and organization at W&L
with which he will have to deal.
During his undergraduate years at
W&L he was extremely active in

many campus organizations and an
officer of several. He participated in
school politics and was an outstand-
ing student.

Mr. Lane, a native Richmonder, ts
a member of Phi Delta Theta social
fraternity at Washington and Lee. He
presided over the chapter as its Presi-
dent in his Senior year. Mr, Lane's
influence on campus spread far be-
yond his fraternity, however. He was
a prominent member of both the Stu-
dent Service Society an dithe Uni-
versity Christian Association, serving
as President of the former and Vice-
President of the latter in 1963-4,

A particular interest of Mr. Lane’s
was University social life. Through
his elective office as President of the
Senior class Mr. Lane was the Presi-
dent of Finals Dance in 1964, He
also earned a place on the Dance
Board on his own merit, however,
and was Vice-President of the Board
in his senior year.

Among his more notable honors at
W&L were his being tapped into
Omicron Delta Kappa national honor-
ary society, his election as class presi-
dent, and his tenure as Editor-in-Chief
of The Friday Ring-tum Phi in 1963-
64. He was also a Dean's List and
Honor Roll student.

Troubadours present ten
one-act plays through Wed,

Washington and Lee’s final drama-
tic offering of the year is now under
way at the Troubadour Theatre. Be-
ginning last night and continuing
through tomorrow night, there is a
presentation of ten one-act plays, all
under the direction of students.

The current performances are not

a Troubadour production as such.
They are the result of efforts by
W&L Drama Professor Lee Kahn's

directing class. While many of the
actors and directors are members of
the Troubadours, the directors are all
members of Mr. Kahn's class.

The directors were given complete
freedom to choose their plays. How-
ever, despite the wide range of
latitude this afforded, most of the
plays can be grouped under a general
theme of modern absurdist drama.
Only one of the plays is a completely
original effort, Dave Waelder’s “Two,”
the play he directed along with Jud-

|son Simmons

Following his graduation from |
Washington and Lee, Mr. Lane en-|
rolled in Union Theological Seminary |
in New York. He expects to receive |
his Bachelor of Divinity degree from |
that institution next month, |

The new Student Center Dircetor |
will have primary responsibility for |
the organization of the new Center. |
The current Assimilation Committee |
has been assigned to work with Mr. |
Lane in the initial stages of the|
Center's establishment, but it will)
eventually hand over all responsibility |
to him. He will manage the new)
tavern, as well as the various recrea-
tional facilities provided by the new
Center. It is possible that dances and
parties will be held in the new
Center.

It has been suggested in the EC
that the Assimilation Committee De |
permanently assigned to the Student!
Center.

In the remaining two nights of
the three night production seven plays
will be performed, Tonight's offering
will feature “3000 Red Ants,” the
“Ugly Duckling,” “Fancy Act I,” and
“Two.”

The first play, “3000 Red Ants,”
was written by Ferlinghetti and cen-
ters around an unusual setting. It
depicts a couple in bed, but they
mime their actions standing up with
two pillows suspended behind them as
if showing an overhead view. The
play attempts to show relatively
sterile people in a relatively sterile
environment,

The “Ugly Duckling” portrays a
King with an ugly daughter whom
he is trying to marry off. “Fancy Act
it” is an absurdist murder play. The
Waelder-Simmons entry, “Two,” deals
with the topic of boy-girl tension

Ihe Executive Committee met for
the last time this year Monday night,
but not without turning its attention
to several matters of importance. In
the last meeting to be presided over
by President Jay Passavant, the EC
voted to assess the student body two
dollars per person for next year’s
Contact symposium and to withdraw
Washington and Lee from the Vir-
ginia Student Governments Associa-
tion.

First item on the agenda was the
request of the Contact chairman,
Larry Honig, for a two dollar student
body assessment. It was pointed out
that last year’s student body was also
assessed for Contact. The chairman
presented his financial statement of
the past year’s expenses of the pro-
gram and his expectations of next
year’s budget. After his presentation
the committee decided to vote. The

motion to enforce a student assess-
ment passed unanimously with no
abstentions,

 

i the year. The evening will begin with
a William Butler Yeats play, “Purga-
tory,” which was not intended for
production originally. The second one-
act performance will be Leroi Jones’
“Dutchman.” It faces the problem of
the Negro forced to conform to mod-
ern society, but wanting to live in-
dependently. White violence under-
lies the repressed desire of the black
man to break the white hold. The
final offering of the night will be
“Crucifixation,” a miracle play.

Last night, the three day series got
off to a fine start with a presentation
of “Endgame,” a Samuel Beckett play
which is probably the most well
known of the ten. It was followed by
“Act Without Words,” a_ rather

Ihe Committee then turned its at-
|tention to a request by the W&L
| Rugby club for five hundred dollars
with which to meet its operating ex-
penses for the coming year, The EC
had appropriated three hundred dol-
lars to the club last year for new
uniforms. The additional two hundred
dollars this year was requested on
the expectation that the club will
expand its operations considerably in
the coming year. In the absence of
a financial report from the club, the
EC voted it one hundred dollar
appropriation to meet Summer operat-
ing expenses. The club will present a
detailed budget to the EC in the
fall if it requests further funds. It
was also suggested that the club ex-
plore other outlets for revenue such
as the administration and the athletic

department.
A motion was made to warn all
witnesses and accused in Honor

Trials, of their full rights under the
system at the time of their summons.

concluded with the performance of |
“Our Man In Madras” by Gurt Hoff-
man. The play is built upon a tele-
phone conversation with a man in|
Madras, and focuses on how man)
can use catastrophe to advantage. It
is a Satire On existence.

cause there will be no reservations,

Wrapping
it all up

The 1969 Calyx should come out
some time during exams according
to Business Manager Jeff Wexler. The

It was pointed out that in several
instances, students had been called to
the witness stand in Honor Trials on
nights before they faced tests. In these
cases, the witnesses are allowed to
take the test at a later date, but
some students this year have failed
examinations due to their ignorance
of their rights. The motion was dis-
allowed because such information on
rights is already supposed to be offer-
ed, but the Committee did pledge to
be more careful to warn witnesses of
their rights,

For the third week in a row, the
Committee was forced to postpone
interviews for the posts of co-chair-
man of the Mock Convention due to

Magnificent Men to preview new
album at W&L in Finals concert

By REED BYRUM

Rhythm and Blues has forever been
a secular mode of expression of Negro
groups and individuals, until the in-
ception of the Righteous Brothers
several years ago. However, the Right-
eous Brothers have since split up,
and their slack has been picked up
by one of the biggest college at-
tractions on the east coast, the Magni-
ficent Men,

The Mag Men hit it big with their
first album, “Peace of Mind” two
years ago and have remained on top
since then. Their second album, re-
corded at the Uptown Theatre in Phil-
adelphia, has already sold over 100,-
000 copies with many more sales an-
ticipated. They have established their
reputation as the best “blue-eyed
soul” group in the nation and have
had number one hits in Philadelphia,
Cleveland, D.C., Chicago, New York
and Motown.

WAL will be the scene of a pre-
view of their current album, “The
World of Soul,” plus their newest
single “Save the Country.” Capital
Records predicated that their album
would be one of the top-selling cuts
of the year, thus putting complete
confidence in the Mag Men.

The group was supposed to appear
at Springs weekend earlier this year,
but travel and time difficulties pro-
hibited them from doing so. When
they finally arrived, they asked to
come back when they saw the recep-
tion for Jerry Butler and were over-
joyed when they signed their finals
contract.

Joining the Magnificent Men will
be the world famous Platters who
have accumulated 13 gold records and
3 gold albums since 1956. They will
feature such songs as “Smoke Gets
in Your Eyes,” “The Great Pre-
tender,” “The Magic Touch,” and
“With This Ring.”

Before arriving at WAL, they will
have just completed a three-week
stretch at the Club Atlantis in the
Regency Hyatt House in Atlanta.
They present comedy and dancing be-
sides their fantastic singing, being one
of the most versatile groups in en-
tertainment.

On Tuesday, June 3, a cocktail
party will be held in Red Square
from 3:00 p.m. until 6:00 p.m. The

 

 

Tempests will provide the background
music for the party. Later that even-
ing, from 8:00 to 10:00, the Platters
and the Mag Men will entertain in
Doremus Gymnasium; tickets will be
available at the Co-op. Following the
concert, there will be another combo
party, this one at the Pavilion, with
the Marlboros playing.

Wednesday, June 4, will feature
another pair of events, beginning
with the In-Men singing at a party
in Red Square, from 2:00 until 6:00.
This will be followed later in the
evening with the Kallabash Corpora-
tion playing at a combo party at the
Pavilion, starting at 8:00. The events
of both days are being sponsored

jointly by the Dance Board, the
Senior Class and the IFC.
Law elections held;
Perow to be President,
Reed Vice-president

The Law School capped off its

political year with the selection of
its remaining organizational officers
last week. Editors of the W&l
Lawyer were chosen and a student
body election determined the new
officers of the Student Bar Associa-
tion as the Law School cleared its
agenda in anticipation of exams.

A meeting on May 10 saw Mosby
Perrow elected President of the SBA
for next year. Other officers elected
to assist him are Beverly Reed as
Vice-President, Frank Selbe as Sec-
retary, and Jerry Roehl as Treasurer.
The Student Bar Association is the
main governing body of the Law
School. The new officers will assume
their offices in September for the
duration of the Fall Semester, 1969.

Frank Selbe will also serve with
Charles Bishop as co-editor of the

W&L Lawyer. The publication is
issued semi-annually. The news edi-
tion covers events occuring in the

School and appears in the Spring.
The placement edition is published in
the Fall and goes to some five hun-
dred selected law firms and pre-law
advisors at all accredited colleges and
universities. In addition, the W&L
Lawyer is sent to all WAL Law
School alumni. The circulation of the
Spring news edition is restricted to
alumni,

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Good-bye

In this the best of all possible universities we have for
three years worked on something less than the best of all
possible newspapers. We have gotten excited when others saw
little reason for getting excited, we have eaten hamburgers
from the Co-op until we imagined there was no other lunch

on Tuesday morning, and we

have cut far too many classes

for no other reason than to watch four pieces of metal, size
12 x 18, fill up with lead type and wood blocks. And we loved

every minute of it.

For us, creation was the name of the game. We found in
The Ring-tum Phi something we intensely enjoyed, and our
life was intensely steeped in the serio-comics of this glorious

rag with the absurd name.

Every Editor finds it his right, if not his duty, to put into
words his thoughts, his emotions, and perhaps too much of
himself. We have proved no exception to this; in return it
has tendered one of those all too rare and deeply satisfying
personal experiences we now leave with no small degree of
sadness. And now we’re through.

Or almost through. It would be unfair to leave without
expressing some words of appreciation to the many who have
made our task a bit easier and a good deal more pleasant;
but it would be equally impossible to do so in any complete

way

So we choose to publicly and indelibly say thanks to the

two men who have labored as much as we have this year,
Reeve Kelsey and Reed Byrum, without whose thoughts and
words and cajolery and support and most of all, friendship,
this paper would have been much, much less than what it was.

 

From Vietman and mom
and to Bolivia with love

By JACK HOROWITZ

Michael Thomas is finishing his
second year of teaching at Washing-
ton and Lee. Sociology is the title on
his degree. Social problems is the
title of one of his courses. It meets
at 11:00 a.m., Monday, Wednesday
this week, Tuesday, Thursday last.

Sociology is about people. Some
study books to learn about people.
That's OK but not the only way. Mr.
Thomas knows that this is so. So
he tries to do more.

A social problem today is campus
unrest. The New York Times and the
Village Voice both have cures for
the trouble. But once the blood spat-
ters on the pavement it never comes
all the way clean. If you can’t stop
trouble before the blood flows, the
pressure pile of conflict grows and
the world becomes more and more
insane. Mr. Thomas knows that this
is so. So he tries to do more than
just read about people in books. He
tries to do something about the prob-
lem.

People in books equal history. And
if history can't be used to understand

 

YR’s sponsoring
drive for food
to benefit Biafra

Over the weekend the Slater Cater-
ing Service contributed $200 to the
WAL Food for Nigeria/Biafra. This
large contribution came as a surprise
and almost doubled the amount of
money pledged to date. Mr. Darrell,
who runs Evans Dining Hall, will pre-
sent the check later this week,

Today and tomorrow, the collection
will consist of marked cans placed
around the campus. On Thursday,
the day of fasting, the WAL fra-
ternities are asked to close their
kitchens and contribute the cost of
food for one day to the fund-raising
drive.

If the fraternities want to partici-
pate but do not want to close their
kitchen, they are asked to approve
a small assessment and contribute
this,

Any campus organization that
wishes to help either by contributing
money or by promoting the fund-
raising effort is urged to do so,

The money, once collected, will be
sent to the U.S. Committee for
UNICEF. UNICEF, which has pro-
vided over 40 per cent of the aid
that Nigeria and Biafra have received
is only concerned with feeding and
caring for the women and children
of the two countries. It does not take
a political stand and is not prolong-
ing the war effort.

About 40 people attended the two
showings of the film “A Matter of
Life and Death” shown in Reid Hall
yesterday, which officially began the
fund-raising effort.

The film was a short documentary
analyzing the conditions in Biafra and
Nigeria.

So far, five fraternity houses have
agreed to close their kitchens and
donate the cost of the food to the
drive. The houses are Beta, ZBT,
KA, PEP, and Sigma Nu.

The drive is being sponsored by the
WAL Young Republican Club. It was
initiated when the club was approach-
ed by President Huniley.

something about now then it’s not
worth a whole lot. Sometimes mak-
ing history worth something is called
relevance in education. But what it
really is can be called education com-
ing alive. Mr. Thomas knows. this
too.

Yesterday morning at Il am.
when Michael Thomas walked into
New Science 201 to meet his “Social
Problems” class he was accompanied
by three visitors. President Huntley,
Dean Atwood, and | had been in-
vited to talk about questions of stu-
dent activism on campus. So the sides
were chosen and the class began.

Speaking first with arguments that
had been growing in my head since
Berkley in 1964 I found an occasional
nod of agreement from the other
team. President Huntley followed me,
then Dean Atwood, then more from
each of us. Violence, Vietnam, Mom,
and Apple Pie were mentioned. A
community of ideas was called for,
closed faculty meetings were denounc-
ed as inconsistant with free exchange
of ideas, radicals were labeled both
psychological misfiets and the best of
American youth. All this was tossed
about and more. Surprisingly new
sides were frequently chosen. During
the fifty minute class American flags
on car windows and coats with ties
stopped meaning which side one was
on.

Questions came from the floor.
“Gross” Johnson and “hippie-radical”
Horowitz even agreed at one point.
And then the bell. If there was a
final decision then the referee's and
the ring judges’ card read—If things
can't be worked out at WAL then
maybe they can't be worked out any-
where.

As we left the New Science Build-
ing | spoke with President Huntley:
“Please call me Jack,” | said, “and
I think workable communication ar-
rangements are the answer.” Then
Dean Atwood promised to read the
Village Voice | gave him along
with his New York Times and Wall
Street Journal.

I'm going to Bolivia next year with
the Peace Corps, But Washington and
Lee and Huniley and Atwood remain.
There will be new Freshmen and new
faculty joining this year's faces, I
hope they remember that if it can't
be worked out at WAL then maybe
no one can make it anywhere.

 

P-vant credits

wit successes

By JAY PASSAVANT
Student Body President

Upon receiving the two awards last
Wednesday evening, | couldn't help
but feel as though I were accepting
them on behalf of the 1968-69 Ex-
ecutive Committee. Although I was
deeply grateful for the awards per-
sonally, there can be little question
tha the recognition that they bring
should go to the E.C. as a whole,
and not just One student,

I wish to express my sincere ap-
preciation for the awards I received,
but more importantly, I would ask
the Student Body laud not one per-
son, but twelve, not the individual,
but the group. The student body of
Washington and Lee can certainly be
proud of the efforts put forth by
these dedicated students during the
past school year as each member,
without exception, has given freely
of his time and energy. You may
rest assured that even if the E.C, had
no legislative meetings whatsoever, the
time given by these men to honor
cases alone would be extremely
burdensome. Yet the members of this
E.C, have achieved much in the
legislative realm and have accrued to
themselves an admirable record. A
summary of achievements is not really
necessary as those students who are
interested in the University know that
the E.C. has been active in many
areas.

Though I wish to refrain from
commending each individual, | must
express sincere thanks for the superior
contribution of Staman Ogilvie and
Joe Tompkins. These two men
characterize the spirit of dedication
and co-operation evident in all mem-
bers of the Executive Committee.

In addition, I would like to applaud
Danny Leonard and Pete Hendricks
for their invaluable assistance in the
administration of the honor system.
Danny and Pete provided leadership
during investigations and honor trials
when it was needed the most. Due to
the confidential nature of the honor
system, these contributions were not
readily apparent to the student body.
These men, as did all other members
of the Committee, dedicated their
efforts to the maintenance of our
cherished tradition.

It is with intense pride that I view
the achievements of these eleven men
over the past year and I am certain
that the four men re-elected to the
Committee for next year will con-
tinue to serve Washington and Lee
with great distinction.

Beware the jabberwock, kid

By JEFFREY WEXLER
Columnist

I read my New York Times on
Sunday. I basked awhile in the hesi-
tant sun and read a book. We all
exist. As Santayana wrote, “There is
no cure for birth and death save to
enjoy the interval.” With certain pre-
sumption, I might add, “enjoy the
interval as men, not marionettes to
times or events or institutions.” These
are the puppets, not we.

“Bugs” Baer died, I read in Sun-
day’s Times. He was 83. You prob-
ably have never heard of him. He
was a columnist a bit better than this
correspondent. But he reached full-
flower in an era golden . . . and,
like Mr. Baer, lamentably dead. The
past, mes vieux, is done. It won't
be here reviled today, And, childer,
prognostications of the future won't
add anything more to what you know
of it than what | know of it. Which,
in the last analysis, is nothing.

 

So, here I reflect both on a rising
spectre in this great national Nation
and on a dying phenomenon in the
Republic. The spectre is Media: the
Fourth Estate. Like one of those
ancient four horsemen it spreads a
disease in epidemic proportions:
Cupidity, the lust for affluence. Radix
malorum est cupiditas. This dying
phenomenon grows weaker as the
passion of man for lucre grows
greater. The phenomenon is civility,
Into its wake has come a latter-day
replacement: impersonality. We are
friendly to those who can help us.
Now, at this point, one might say,
this is the way it has been since Christ
and before. Yes, but not in these
epic proportions, | might add. Men
no longer seek each other's company.
The instant rich (just add Scotch and
ice) are instant rich because they're
all like Sammy. And you know what
made him run: cupidity. “Money,”
as Ayn Rand shrugged, “is the root of
all good.”

 

Of catechisms

DAVE HIGGINS
Columnist

Despite the implications of a grad-
ing system to the contrary, the best
educated are not necessarily the most
knowledgeable. In today’s process of
mass education the genius is un-
fortunately the memory bank, a per-
son who succeeds not because he is
educated but because he beats the
educational system. A true genius is
an adapter who succeeds because of
his ability to comprehend not his
ability to recall what others compre-
hend and wrote for him to study. The
memory bank by the very nature of
his approach is a man of limited
abiliity; he will succeed in the system
but will be limited to contributing to
the system alone, a fact which makes
his education appear circular rather
than linear,

A linear education would imply
that a man never returns to a previ-
ous point in his development. This is
to say that his education develops the
skills of learning and allows him to
apply them in never-ending situations.
The memory bank who learns the
products of the system without com-
prehending the system itself must re-
turn to the system if he is to be
productive.

Since there are very few geniuses

 

in the world, it does not really matter
that the educational process is geared

That was the year, ete.

This might come as a great shock
to my many millions of faithful read-
ers, but this will be my last column
of the year, mainly because this is
the year's last Tuesday edition of the
Ring-tum Phi. But do not be too
despondent, dear reader, Young Mr.
Yevich has begged me to continue
writing the column next year,

Much has happened at WAL dur-
ing my semester of writing “From the
J-School.” (Maybe | should say much
has happened despite my writing
“From the J-School,”)

Probably never before has one
semester seen so much constructive
change at this dowdy old institution
of higher learning.

To begin with, this the first se-
mester of the Say Week. Unfor-
tunately it might be the last. The
absence rate at 8 a.m. classes and
at Friday classes has been high
enough to cause a number of faculty
members to change their minds about
the merits of 5-Day Week. Hope-
fully, the students will not abuse the
privilege next fall, The students are
almost unanimous in support of the

5-Day Week, according to a recent
Ring-tum Phi poll, and it would be
a shame to lose it.

During the semester, the faculty
passed a 12-12-6 calendar, a liberali-
zation of dormitory regulations, and
a lessening of distribution require-
ments, All are worthwhile changes.

The 12-12-6 calendar will give the
serious student the chance to do some
constructive independent study. The
other two changes are long overdue
necessities for a modern university.

Presently, committees of students
and faculty are investigating the feasi-
bility of an expanded enrollment and
coeducation, The betting seems to be
that coeducation will be a reality
by Sept., 1970.

This has also been a good semester
for WAL athletics. An outstanding
performance by all four teams at the
College Athletic Conference Spring
Sports Festival enabled WAL to
maintain possession of the CAC Bell,
symbol of overall conference athletic
supremacy. The tennis team won its
third straight conference crown, the
golf team enjoyed another winning
season, the baseball team chalked up
its greatest number of victories since

1952, and the track team had its
best finish ever in the conference
meet.

I still have some complaints about
life at WAL. I think President Hunt-
ley should have asked for applications
before naming students to the co-
education and size committees, But
an overall view of the University at
the end of this semester is much
better than it was at the start of the
semester.

Anyone interest in working on the

ed by the paper

 

and things

to reptition in general. However by
using such a process, the majority of
the intellectually talented people are
forced to limit themselves. This is not
to say that our educational system
does not produce well-educated men
of ability, but it is to say that the
system stifles many would-be produc-
ers, the genius type succeeding despite
the system.

Many people would abolish the
grading system in an attempt to pre-
vent this stifling, but such a move
would be unproductive. The average
student should be a product of the sys-
tem so that he can contribute to the
system on which so much of modern
life is based. The man of unusual
ability, however, should recognize that
grades are “the name of the game” and
should, if he has sufficient motivation,
supercede the system by not being
satisfield with grades alone. He will
have to succeed despite the system or
in addition to the system. But he
will find himself educated in the true
sense of the word.

This motivation must come from
outside the usual academic system and
may result in much skeptical com-
ment. But if a man wishes to de-
velop to his fullest, he must be
mislead by the system. Systematized
knowledge is not the goal but a means.
His education should exceed the
limited goal of knowledgeability. His
education should be the development
of a talented insight not the accumla-
tion of patented answering.

It is very difficult to succed despite
the norm; however this seems to be
the only alternative in an environment
geared to the average. But then isn't
it the mark of a genius that he is
not average? Perhaps a system will
ultimately force exceptions to the
rule to arise more and more frequ-
ently. If such occurs then the educa-
tional system will have succeded de-
spite itself. But until then students
should not be misled by the logical
but inconclusive implications of a
system.

Letters
To he Editor

Small questions
propriety
Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I would like to question the propri-
ety of the current Biafran food drive
being handled by the WAL YR’.
According to my sources, the drive
was initiated by a letter from Senator
Edward Kennedy to President Robert
Huntley concerning participation in
such a drive, President Huniley for-
warding the letter to the YR's for
consideration.

Doesn't this seem rather odd? The
YR's are a political not a charitable,
organization; they exist primarily as
a means of getting college-age indi-
viduals involved in the Republican
Party. Furthermore, it is even more
curious when it is remembered that
this drive is sponsored by the United
Nations, and the national YR organi-
zation has repeatedly been rather
opposed to the UN

Wouldn't it make more sense to
have forwarded the letter to one of
the several campus charitable organi-
zations, or to the Political Science
Club, which, at least, has more UN
contacts than the YR's? And what
of the Young Democrats, the party
of the man who involved us in this
in the first place?

There is something lacking in the
decision to have the YR's sponsor
such a drive. It just doesn't make
serine

 

So we seek the silver, not the
bread nor the wine, Eat, drink, and
be merry . . tomorrow. Today,
we're too busy being successful. So
our colleagues become handholds on
the ladder. Once used, they are
dropped for another buddy. I need
not, I trust, cite examples, my dear
friends . . . Without fellow-travellers,
with only competitors, where can our
brave new man find peace? What are
the pitstops on the road, the ladder,
the treadmill to success? Media!!!
Cinematographic stereophonic W.W.
W.W.—A.M. and F.M.! Magazines!
Newspapers, records, and the idiot
box!! MEDIA! We are seduced by
colors and sounds and layout and
foldout. Covered with millions of tons
of newsprint and celluloid film and
recorded tape and plastic platters, we
are invincible from one another, de-
fended by our seductress, and we are
alone...

BABY, THAT’S WHERE IT’S AT,

Media!!! Tom Wolfe knows it. But
he’s a card carrrying member of it.
He, they, me(?) have got you. You're
trapped. You've tuned in, turned on,
dropped out. You don’t listen to the
people around you. They're not in
stereo. Love comes last. How can any
girl compare to fifteen square feet of
Candy's left breast? In technicolor!!
Good grief, Daddy, people are unreal.
Media is the new reality.

So the Fourth Estate assumes the
prerogatives of the first three and
dictates all values, all desires, aspira-
tions, standards, and it dreams for
us too. Madison Avenue and the fol-
lowers of Cecil B, deMille and the
Grove Press and the grey eminences
behing the N.B.C. peacock have teem-
ed up to create a system of domina-
tion of minds and mores more insidi-
ous than anything those old bogey-
men of the Military-Industrial Com-
plex could ever nightmare up. All
them generals and button-pushers and
contractors want to do is destroy the
world. Clean. Simple. Bang. Why go
with a whimper in a million million
years when you can go out now—
in style?

Media won't kill us. It maims. The
gospel of the great god. Media is
Mediocrity. Believe me, check your
Funk and Wagnells, boobtubers, they
come from the same Latin root. The
middle class minds of the Fourth
Estate are leading us to a temporal
salvation, a neuter utopia that runs
on AC and DC and runs nowhere.
Excellence is heresy to Media. So
we get adequacy. No more wit. Only
half-wits. Media, Latin for half. A
paradise, we are seduced to, a Para-
dise so mediocre, we'll sleep through
Armageddon, whimpering . . . Give
me the Military-Industrial Complex.
rll go as I live, with thunder and
flame. Only when man ceases mock-
ing himself does he become a mock-
ery. Look around you. No one’s
laughing.

out that

the issue be treated this year. After

several more statements which ex-
pressed general dissatisfaction with
the organizations competence and a

fear that the organization was drifting

called for. The resolution to withdraw

one abstention.

(Continued from Page 1)

In questioning Dean John about
the many changes that have come
about during the past year this writer
found that he is definitely to be
counted in with the progessive side of
the faculty.

Though Dean John voted for the
12-12-6 system he has no real prefer-
ence for when the short term is held.
He does however, support the short
term in itself and sees great pos-
sibilities in it. Though he admitted
the possibility of abuse of the short
term he expressed a great faith in
the maturity of the W&L student
body and said that he was essentially
optimistic about the success of the
plan. He also said hat the success
would also depend on the instructors
and what they will demand of their
students.

In respect to the liberalized cur-
will be beneficial and attractive
students from both ends of the intel-
lectual spectrum. He feels that
extremely gifted students will be able
to go right into fields in which they
are interested while the less gifted
will not be so highly pressured by |
the rigid freshman requirements |

About the possibility of W&L|
going Co-ed, Dean John simply stat- |
ed that he had not made up his mind
on this issue. However, he did admit
that at this time he would be in- |
clined to vote for the move to go)
Co-ed. He that he was on the |
committee for the study of the ques-
tion and felt that a great deal of |
study must be done before the matter |
can be decided,

said

Dean John mentioned several times
in Our conversation the excellent com-
munication between the students of
WA&L and the administration and
faculty. He forsees the continuation |
of the ability of students to voice their
desires through proper channels and

the willingness of the faculty to listen

and move to enact constructive
changes.
The many physical changes o¢-

curing on campus are seen by Dean
John great boost to the Uni-
versity and is optimistic of far-reach-
ing beneficial results of the physical
improvement of the school.

would become a more truly resi-

rules as a logical extension of the
ever-increasing student  self-govern-
ment and is Optimistic that the new

be abused. He again stressed his

In concluding our conversation,

many students in the affairs of the
day: Viet Nam, poverty, social prob-
lems, University modernization and
other similar important aspects of our
life today. He compared our genera-
tion’s activity and desire to be heard
with his generation, calling his the
