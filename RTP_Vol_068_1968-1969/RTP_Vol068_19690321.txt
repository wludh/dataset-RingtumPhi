THE RING-TUM PHI

 

An Experiment Worth Trying...

By LAWRENCE McCONNELL

On February 21, 1969 the Friday Ring-tum
Phi presented an editorial concerning the
establishment of Free Universities at various
colleges in our vicinity. At the conclusion
of the editorial, we stated we felt that a simi-
lar program would work at W&L—if the
students expressed interest.

In conjunction with our initial stand, I
have investigated the possibilities of a type
of Free University here. Professors in many
departments have expressed a great interest in
the idea—but are somewhat skeptical about
student support. Professors that have ex-
pressed an interest in the program range
from Professors George Ray, James Boat-
wright and Peter Cummings in the English
department to Professors Lee Kahn and David
Hall in the fine arts department, to Professor
Delos Hughes in the political science depart-
ment. The sociology and religion departments
have expressed an interest as well.

Along with this array of support from the
faculty, President Robert Huntley has given
his endorsement to an endeavor modeled after
the Free University.

The Free Forum .. .

With this interest in mind, and with the
limited yet encouraging response from con-
versations with students, I intend to present
a plan for a modified Free University—a Free
Forum—before the EC next Monday night.
With EC approval and support, I expect that
after organization of a committee is made by
the EC that the first session of the Free

Forum will be on Saturday, April 12, at
11:00 in the morning.

The program would consist of approxi-
mately five topics of interest to both students
and faculty members, each forum group meet-
ing at the same time each week. The topics
chosen would be those presented by a com-
mittee formed by the E.C. Later, if other
topics seem timely or of interest, they could
be added to the program as well.

Although support from faculty and ad-
ministration is present, the main factor in the
establishment of a project such as the Free
Forum is support from the students. The
project would be worthless if professors or
speakers found little or no interest in the
program. It cannot happen without student
involvement.

Its Purpose .. .

During the past few years, universities
throughout the country have witnessed the
creation of what has been tagged the “Free
University,” or the “Experimental College.”’
These educational phenomena have been a
reaction to “. . . . the stiff formality of the
conventional classroom, the aridity and _ ir-
relevance—in the student’s view—of much of
the official curriculum” (Time, October 21,
1966).

The purpose of many originators of these
programs has been to present courses which
they feel are relevant to present society in the
hope that their university would adopt them
at a later date. Other supporters of the Free
University have advanced a different reason:

some medium is needed for the discussion and
examination of topics of interest that is not
(and perhaps should not) be present in their
school’s curriculum,

Perhaps this latter line of thought would
be a more valid reason for the establishment
of a Free Forum here at Washington and
Lee. Due to problems of our size and scope,
the normal Free University with its prolifera-
tion of courses would probably not be feasible
or even desirable at present. But these prob-
lems would not prevent the creation of a
modified Free University — a weekly Free
Forum which would allow the discussion and
exploration of topics of interest to students
and professors. The range of topics a student
would have to choose from could be varied,
yet small in number.

A Free Forum such as this could be quite
possible here. Meetings for the Forum could
be on Saturday morning at 11:00 when fac-
ulty as well as students are relatively free.
Since none of the classrooms are in use at
this time, President Huntley has made them
available for use by the Free Forum. A stu-
dent would be able to choose between five
topics which might range from the U.S.
position in Southeast Asia to an examination
of the modern cinema or from the discussion
about the “God is dead” theology to per-
forming improvisations on stage.

Its Advantages .. .

The advantage of a Free Forum on Satur-
day morning are threefold. First, students
would have an opportunity to discuss inform-

ally a topic of their special interest with an
equally interested professor. This would elimi-
nate the classroom approach to many courses
in our curriculum, because the “course” in
a Free Forum would need no prepared lecture
by a professor and no tests or notes taken by
the student.

Another advantage is that the time and
place already are available and convenient.
There would be no need to shift the time
of meeting each week. With Saturdays being
relatively free now, interested students ought
to be willing and able to give up an hour out
of their time on Saturday.

Third, with a minimum of conflicts in time
and the scheduling of the forum on the
weekend, the program ought to provide stu-
dents the opportunity to discuss topics of
interest with women from the surrounding
schools. Students could bring their dates to
the forum, or women from neighboring
schools might come to participate. The
chances for this co-educational experience
might be greater if a professor from a nearby
women’s college came to lead a discussion per-
sonally, bringing with him any students that
might be interested.

Its Potential...

With a minimum of planning, the Free
Forum can be a reality. The time and the
place are right; the topics proposed would
be interesting; and the professors would be
stimulating. As was said in our February
21 editorial, “it is only through the students
that the experiment can work.” And the Free
Forum is an experiment worth trying.

Lack Of Student Interest
Shows General Approval

The student body’s interest in the Honor System was
clearly revealed Wednesday evening when only a handful of
students (about 40, including all of the Executive Committee
members except senior EC representative Bill Brown) showed

up in Lee Chapel for the Bitch-In.

The small crowd was disappointing to us because the issue
at hand, namely the Honor System, has been an important
bone of contention all year. Students have been complaining
about it constantly, yelling for change. Yet, when they finally
have a chance to be heard and make suggestions they ignore

the opportunity.

The only conclusion we can come to, and
we hope the EC will finally decide upon at its
day night, is one of general approval by the
of the student body. It can only be assumed
by not showing up and airing their views on

tradition, agree entirely with the EC’s proposals and are will-
ing to let the EC use its discretion in revising the Honor |

System.

Since the facts can only be interpreted in the above man-
ner, we urge the EC to approve the procedural changes con-
cerning honor trials. In addition, we urge the EC to adopt
certain general guidelines concerning the jurisdiction of the
Honor System. (These guidelines may have to be more de-
tailed than members of the EC may want, but they must be
established to eliminate the ambiguity that currently exists.)

These revisions will undoubtedly strengthen the Honor
System, for it will prove that a strong tradition can keep up
with the changing needs of a changing student body. In the
end, all of us can be proud that this system can weather
student changes and will not be allowed to stagnate by in-

herent weaknesses.

By BILL WALKER
Freshman Law Student

When the Executive Committee of
the student body announced recently
its intention to effect a study of the
Honor System, there was hope that
at least there might be a systematic
reevaluation of both its dictates and
its administration, and that a thorough
program of change might be instituted
in an attempt to temper our law
with justice.

It was also hoped that the Executive
Committee might devise a plan to
divest itself of some of its awesome
and unchecked power in matters deal-
ing with the Honor System. But the
changes which have been proposed
by the Committee will only add to
it, power, and further isolate our
Honor System from justice.

 

The central concern manifested by
the Committee's proposals is that the
traditional rules of procedure im-
pede the function of the Honor Sys-
tem as they understand it. We are
told that the sole purpose of the
Committee is to ascertain the facts
of an alleged violation, and to render
a judgment thereon. It is apparently
felt that all precautions must be taken
to insure that me guilty party be
allowed to escape retribution and
exile, without regard to individual
right or justice. The central concern
of the proposals is obviously the sys-
tem itself, the absolute efficacy of
i the law.

tee has overlooked or ignored the
fact that laws are instituted by man
for man, and that the law is only
a method for ordering our lives.
The goal of any legal system must
be the equitable administration of
justice. When the law becomes its
own end, an omnipotent and in-
fallible deity, justice is defeated,
and only raw power remains, That
power directs itself toward the de-
struction of the individual to pre-
serve the system. Any changes
serve only the law not man,

The Executive Committee, its
proposed procedural changes, has
demonstrated great concern for the
system, but none for the protection
of the individual. In its attempt to
eliminate all procedural technicali-
ties, the Commitiee has lost sight of
individual rights and justice. The in-
dividual is reduced simply to a tool
of the system. The first responsibility
that the Committee feels seems to be
to the system itself, and not to the
thirteen hundred men who grant its
existence.

ADVERSARY SYSTEM

The Committee has stated that the
adversary system is to be avoided.
But is such avoidance meant to pro-
tect the individual or the law? The
adversary system is designed so that
each side must accept total responsi-

responsibility, to most efficiently and
convincingly present its case, will
win. It prevents giving all the ad-
vantages to the prosecution, the law,
as the Committee seems to favor. If
ii sometimes allows the guilty to
escape, it also protects all parties,
and guarantees due process of law.

The Committee further proposes
that the President of the student body
preside at the public appellate trial.
Perhaps this would serve to protect
the initial conviction by the Executive
Committee, but it offers little pro-
tection to the accused. It is an
obvious invitation to executive parti-
ality. It would allow the same judge
to hear both the trial and appeal,
and therefore to bring to the appeal!
definite preconceptions and prejudices.

previous hearing and judgment. Thus
men would be forsaken to strengthen
the system,

The Executive Committee also pro-
poses that the Jury be allowed to
summon and question its own wil-
nesses. Again, the Committee invites
partiality and prejudice. Evidence
should be presented te the jury, not
solicited by the jury. Otherwise, the
deliberating body is simultaneously
an investigationg body, which is an
irreconcilable conflict of duty.

INDIVIDUAL PROTECTION
I agree with the Executive Com-
mitiee that a need exists for pro-
cedural change, but I feel that
emphasis should be directed toward
protection of the individual; the

The corporation is a private, non-

Bucknell is one of the top teams in
its league.

In describing Bucknell, Coach
Szlasa sees much similarity between
them and Franklin and Marshall, a
team the Generals beat in a practice
scrimmage 8-4, Both F&M and Buck-
nell are big teams physically, but the
Generals rely on good shooting, team
balance and strong defense to com
pensate for this disadvantage.

Providing much of the offense will
be attackmen Joe Wich, Butch Neese,

Dick Capron, Adding more depth are
freshman Mark Skoggard, sophomore
Jimmy Allen, and junior Tom Rob
son.

Defense could be the strongest ele
ment of the team. Coach Szlasa de-
lights in the play of senior co-captain
Charlie Stewart, a fine leader who
has been particularly impressive in the
scrimmages. But Stewart not a
one man show; he receives competent
help from New Coslett and Tom
Mullenix. The latter has been the
surprise of the year and enables Coach
Szlasa to mave regular defenseman
Bill Brumbach to midfield, when he
returns from swimming in the Na
tional Championship Meet in Spring-
field, Mass.

Depth on defense is supplied by
freshman Tommy Smith (an all-Mary
land performer in high school), Frank
Siearns, George Stowe, and Bobby
Radcliff. Also, there a wealth of
talent the goal. Senior Pete
Nowick presently waging a nip
and tuck battle with sophomore Bill
Ingersoll. Nowick is a fine field gen-
eral and good on clearing, but Ing-

The Ignorance of Justice

(Continued from Page 2) accused be allowed to select coun-
sel PRIOR TO the secret trial.
Counsel could then help the ac-
cused during the twenty-four hours
prior to trial to prepare a compre-
hensive defense, and then to pre-
sent that defense to the Executive
Committee, It cannot serve justice
to submit a frightened and upset
individual to trial totally alone,
without representation of his own

system is already extremely well
protected. I would suggest that the
Committee accept the proposal that
an accused violator be given a mini-
mum notice of twenty-four hours
prior to trial, The accused needs
at least that long to recover from
the intial shock of accusation, and
to prepare his own defense. It is

patently unjust to force an ac- choosing.
cused man to face a prepared case di * td
by the prosecution when he has inally, 1 would urge that a

senior law student continue to serve
as the judge at the public trial,
both to preserve impartiality in that
extremely important position, and
to bring to the bench some ap-
preciation and understanding of its
proper function,

not been allowed to prepare a
comparable case on his own be-
half,

I would further suggest that the

Commerce Majors Named
To Honorary Fraternities There is no justification for a legal

/ system which ignores justice, and
justice cannot be served by ignoring
or abusing the rights of the individ-
ual. Guilt or innocence at Washing
ton and Lee is not established until
after the final appeal exhausted,
and every protection should be af-
forded the accused toward that final
determination, Law must never be
more important than the individual’s
right to humanity and justice.

Only the new more luxurious full-

advantage the authentic British
