EC Announces
Successful Vote
On Amendments

A comprehensive report on the
Honor System was unanimously
adopted by the Executive Committee
Wednesday night. The report, print-
ed in full on page two, is designed
to cover all phases of the Honor
System but was issued particularly in
response to questions about jurisdic-
tion and the rights of the accused.

President Jay Passavant announced
at the meeting that Constitutional
amendments clarifying election pro-
cedures and delineating responsibili-
ties of officers were approved in the
referendum March 26 by a vote of
748 to 61.

Committeemen Pete Hendricks and
Stamen Ogilvie were appointed to in-
vestigate the relationship of the Law
School to the EC. They will seek to
determine which student activities
should be jointly conducted by the

Passavant expressed concern that
the Lexington City Council may re
quire students who operate cars to
buy city licenses. The Attorney Gen
eral of Virginia has issued an opinion
that such a tax is legal. The amount
would probably be $8-$10. Passavant
plans to meet with Mayor Douglas
Brady to inform him of student op

ciety, elected him as the University’s

outstanding journalism student dur-
ing his senior year.
President Huntley also announced

that John Hughes, 35, a member of
the University’s public relations staff

since 1965, has been named Curator
of Lee Chapel and Lee Chapel Mu-
seum, and Sports Information Di-
rector,

[he appointments are effective
April 28, when Holland joins the
University staff.

President Huntley said both ap-

pointments are “extremely important
and timely” for W&L. He described
Holland as a “highly-respected and
highly-competent newsman whose
work with the Richmond Times-Dis-
patch has established him as one of
the most knowledgeable and versatile
writers on educational matters in Vir-
ginia.

“We believe Mr. Holland will bring
a distinctive talent to us at a time
when the role of private higher edu-
cation needs to be interpreted with

new clarity and vigor,” President
Huntley said.

President Huntley cited Hughes’
experience in sports news and his

interest in University history and Lee
Chapel memorabilia as a unique
combination of qualifications needed
by WAL.

“Mr. Hughes’ new duties will permit
Washington and Lee to do a better
job than ever before in supporting
its broad inter-collegiate athletic pro-
gram’s requirements in publicity and
promotion,” President Huntley
“At the same time, we hope to give
proper attention to the supervision
and promotion of activities at Lee
Chapel where so many visitors come
each year.”

A graduate of Richmond's Douglas
S. Freeman High School, Holland
was the Lexington area correspondent
for the Times-Dispatch while a stu
dent here. After graduation, he be-
came the newspaper's bureau
at Farmville, Va., covering ten South
side counties. While there he became
author of “The Story of the Prince
Edward Free Schools,” a booklet
copywrighted by the Prince Edward
Free Schoo! Association, the organiza-
tion which provided schooling for the
county's Negro children in 1953-54.

Tomorrow at 2:00, two discussion
groups will meet for the first session
of the Free Forum. Topics for dis-
cussion will be “Is God Dead?” and
“Government vs. Business.” Profes-
sors John Mehl, James Leyburn and
John Fielder will participate in the
“Is God Dead?” discussion, while Dr.
Charles Phillips will head the “Gov-
ernment vs. Business” forum.

At the EC meeting on March 24,
a committee was composed to evaluate
topics for discussion and to choose

several for presentation. Committee
members Steve Sandler, Judson Sim-
mons and Lawrence McConnell ex-
plored several possibilities, but ar-
rived at the two mentioned above
for the Free Forum.

“Is God Dead?”

Ihe “Is God Dead?” forum will

the discussion the students and
faculty present. The Forum will meet
in duPont Auditorium.

Mr. Mehl said that he planned to
“analyze ways in which the popular
‘God is Dead’ slogan is used today.
Among the various questions that will
be raised are whether God is a
factor in the cultural life of our
nation and the question of the use
of ‘God-talk’ in describing the mean-
ing of human existence.”

“Government ys. Business”

Although apparently a broader
topic, “Government vs. Business” will
be concerned with contemporary  is-
sues in governmental regulation of
business and will be held in Newcomb

cussion this week on the SEC and
its recent regulations on the actions
of the stock market.

Dr. Phillips described his discus-
sion an . Opportunity to raise
issues that would not ordinarily be
raised in the classroom. I hope this
forum will be a springboard to the
pursuit of issues than can’t possibly

The Honor System Report Adopted By The EC

[The following is a reproduction of the report
recently adopted by the Executive Committee, The
report was a result of the extensive studies by the
Sub-Committees on the Honor System, the Bitch-In,
and a thorough discussion within the Executive
Committee itself. The information presented here
will be bound in booklet form and distributed to
all members of the student body to serve as a
reference for all matters concerning the Honor
System. Any major changes from the old Honor
System and new clarifications will be noted in bold
face.]

I. Explanation

Phe Honor System of Washington and Lee University
is based on a sole principle: “a man shall conduct
himself as a gentleman at all times.” It is important to
understand that the System is completely student-
administered and concerned solely with those offenses
which are considered as dishonorable by the student
generation involved. Because the system is in essence
a system of honorable conduct, it can not be specifically
codified in every respect; lying, cheating, and stealing
are however, clearly infringements of the Honor System,
and the result of any such offense will be permanent
dismissal from the University. Each student should
realize that any case presented to the Executive Com-
mittee as a possible honor violation will be investigated.
The nature of the facts evaluated will determine whether
or not the case should be referred to one of the EC
standing committees (including the Publications Board
and the Dance Board) rather than to the EC itself. In
those cases designated to go to the EC as a possible
honor violation, only a lack of sufficient evidence will
be cause for voting not to hold an Honor Hearing.

Every student at Washington and Lee has two major
responsibilities to the Honor System. He must conduct
himself as a gentleman at all times and equally im-
portant, he must report any suspected violation of the
System by another student to the Executive Committee
of the Student Body. A student who witnesses or learns
of a violation of the Honor System and fails to report
the violation is himself guilty of a breach of the System.
It is imperative that everyone recognize this duty of
protecting the Honor System and the Student Body.
Loyalty to the student body demands that one report
the violation to the Executive Committee. This can in
no way be construed as policing or tale-bearing; rather,
it is the finest expression of loyalty to a cherished tradi-
tion of honor among a community of self-governing
students.

A student suspected of an honor violation by the
Executive Committee will face a hearing before that
body. This group, duly elected by the students, represents
University student opinion and is in no way responsible
to the faculty or administration. It is their responsibility
to hear all cases and to render verdicts based upon the
evidence presented. All proceedings are confidential

Upon a verdict of guilty by the Executive Com-
mittee, a student who believes himself innocent may
appeal his case to a Student Body Hearing with a jury
of twelve students selected at random from the student
body. The proceedings of this hearing are open to the
view of the student body. The verdict of the Student
Body jury is final, either reversal of the Executive Com-
mittee decision (not guilty) or corroboration of their
decision (guilty). A guilty penalty will result in dis-
missal from the University.

The Executive Committee earnestly discourages the
use of pledges in all matters of minor concern. The
use of a man’s word of honor to regulate trivialities is
dangerous and should certainly be avoided. The written
pledge used in classes on quizzes, examinations, written
problems and papers means that the work which the
student hands in to his professor is his own, which
he himself has done in accordance with the requirements
of the course as laid down by the professor. The faculty
will co-operate in establishing a clear understanding of
these requirements. However, any work handed in for
credit toward a grade will be considered pledged unless
specifically stated otherwise. In any case of doubt as to
the nature or extent of a pledge, the student should

It must be understood tthat no violation of the
Honor System is too small to report. A violation of
the principle of honor, no matter what the degree, is
a breach of the system. One of the greatest dangers to
which an Honor System can be exposed, however, is
that of being “overloaded” with offenses. To avoid this,
and to preserve inviolate a precious heritage, It is
essential that the Honor System shall concern itself
solely with those offenses which are classified dishonor-
able by the public opinion of the student
involved. Hence, there must things
hensible and heartily condemned by the Executive Com-
mittee and all good citizens which still can not be
brought under the Honor System, Among such except-
ions are breaches of social rules and administrative
regulations, failure to pay honest debts, and breaches of
civil contracts, Such offenses fall under the jurisdiction
of other arms of authority at Washington and Lee.

New students especially should take every opportunity
of acquainting themselves with the workings of the
System in detail as well as these general principles.

IL. Procedure of
EC Hearing

I, Procedure to be Used in the Preliminary lnvestiga-
tion and Initial Presentation of the Executive Committee:
A Any Executive Committee member receiving in

formation indicating that an Honor System violation

may have been committed shall report that fact to
the President of the Student Body, The President
and any one of two members of the Executive Com-
mittee chosen by the President shall investigate the
reported violation, If any two of this group feel
that there is sufficient evidence of a possible violation
of the Honor System, the President of the Student

Hody shall immediately refer the matter to the

Faccutive Committee
ih. If the Executive Commitice feels upon this informa

tion or upon the testimony of witnesses that there

is sufficient evidence of an Honor System violation
to justify a further proceeding, they may by a ma-
jority vote of the Committee in office vote to hold

» hearing. Ten of the twelve PC members must he

present to hold the hearimg

C. If a hearing is deemed necessary all witnesses must
be contacted by the Executive Committee prior to
5:00 p.m. the day of the hearing.

D. The accused student must be informed of his status
with a brief description of the offense involved (time,
location and nature) no later than 5:00 p.m. of the
day of the hearing, but not before 4:00 p.m, the
same day. Under exceptional circumstances, the
accused may be given a period of time beyond the
normal two-hour period of notice before his hear-
ing; this amount shall be subject to the approval
of the President of the Executive Committee, Upon
notification of the accused, he will be informed of
his rights and a statement indicating that he under-
stands his rights and the forthcoming procedure must
be signed prior to the hearing.

E. The Executive Committee hearing will begin at 7:00
p.m. on the same day that the accused is notified
or for good reason, at the President’s discretion.

F, Just prior to the beginning of the hearing, the Vice-
President of the Executive Committee shall inform
the accused of his rights.

Il. Procedure for Honor System Hearings by the
Executive Committee of the Student Body:

A. When the suspected student appears before the

Executive Committee the President shall say to him:
“Information has come to the Executive Com.
mittee indicating that you may have violated
the Honor System in that... (here state briefly
a description of the alleged violation as be-
fore)...and now you are to have a hearing
before the Executive Committee of the Student
Body.”

1. In addition he shall be told that the purpose of
the Committee is to ascertain the facts of the
case and not to prosecute him, that he may call
witnesses who possess pertinent information con-
cerning the matter, and that the Vice-President
of the student body shall be his technical advisor.
Finally he will be reminded that he does not
have to testify and that if he chooses to do so
in this hearing, he must also do so in the event
of a public honor hearing, and that any recording
of testimony may be used by the Executive
Committee in the event of a subsequent public
hearing and may be introduced by the Executive
Committee at any time and for any reason.

B. The accused student shall be permitted to remain
present throughout the questioning of witnesses and
all other proceedings of the Executive Committee
hearing except the deliberation of the Executive Com-
mittee which can occur at any time.

C. The Executive Committee shall request to appear
before it as a witness any person who it feels has
information pertinent to the matter being heard.
Testimony may be taken by the President or persons
he may designate in the form of a written statement
signed by the witness and presented to the Executive
Committee. In extra-ordinary circumstances the Ex-

ecutive Committee by a majority vote may accept
an oral statement (not heard in direct testimony).

D. The witnesses are informed of their status and kept
separate from each other and from the student
suspected unless the Executive Committee for good
reason decides otherwise.

E. When a witness is called before the Committee the
President shall say to him:

“You have been called here solely as witness
in the investigation of a possible honor viola-
tion. Take all the time you need to answer
the questions that the members of the Com-
mittee will ask you and a restatement of an
unclear question will be made on your re-
quest.”

F. The accused may ask questions of any witnesses only
after the Executive Committee has completed its
questioning. The accused may call any witness bear-
ing pertinent information to the case.

G. The President, as presiding officer, shall regulate the
order and nature of the questioning. The Secretary
of the Student Body shall tape record all testimony
of the hearing.

H. After the hearing of all evidence the Executive
Committee shall go into executive session to consider
the matter. If it is apparent that nothing further can
be gained from questioning the individual involved
in the case and if there is no further discussion
desired by the Committee the President shall then
declare a brief intermission during which time he
and those designated by him shall each prepare a
resume of pertinent matters bearing on the hearing
taking special pains to set forth an unbiased sum-
mary.

1. The President shall call the committee to order, at
which time the summaries will be presented. After
the summaries a vote shall then be taken by secret
ballot. The President shall instruct the Committee
that each member in voting shall resolve any reason-
able doubt in favor of the suspected. If two-thirds of
the Committee vote guilty, the suspect is found
guilty of a breach of the Honor System.

J. The President shall pronounce to the suspected stu-
dent the determination of the committee. If the
determination of the committee is that the student
violated the Honor System he shall be informed that
the decision of the Executive Committee shall be
final unless within 24 hours he makes a written request
for a Student Body Hearing which, if requested,
will be held in accordance with the procedure estab-
lished by the Executive Committee. The time for
making such a request may be extended in particular
cases in the discretion of the Executive Committee.

K. Upon the announcement to the student of the de-
termination of the committee he shall be accompanied
by two or more members of the Executive Com-
mittee appointed by the President until his departure
from the town of Lexington or until he has requested
a Student Body Hearing within the prescribed time.

L. Upon the expiration of the time within which a Stu-
dent Body Hearing may be requested if no request
is made an announcement shall be placed on the
bulletin boards of the university by the Secretary to
the effect that

“A member of the Student Body has been
found guilty of a violation of the Honor Sys-
tem involving (lying, cheating. stealing, or
knowing of and failing to report a violation),”

M. A hearing may be re-opened upon the production
of new evidence directly bearing on the question
quilt or innecence or to prevent injustices, The
required to re-open a hearing must be equal to
number of FC members who heard the
testimony minus seven; only those EC members f

tw

trit

the initial hearing may vote. Any person seeking to

reopen a hearing shall appear before the Executive

Committee and state the nature of the evidence.

The committee shall then consider whether the

evidence is sufficiently relevant to warrant a re-

hearing. If a hearing is re-opened it shall be entirely
re-heard.

In the event that an accused student seeks to remain

a part of the University without coming to the hear-

ing in face of an honor violation, the hearing will

be conducted in his absence and an indication of
his refusal to testify will be made.

O. Should a student leave the community in face of
a suspected honor violation his permanent record
shall state that he withdrew from the University
without securing official permission and a note made
to the effect that he was facing charges of an honor
violation, After leaving the community he will be
located and notified by the Executive Committee that
he has forty-eight (48) hours in which to return and
face the hearing or his record will be noted as above.
No trial will be heard if he remains outside the
community.

P. If the accused is declared innocent, all evidence and
records of the trial shall be immediately destroyed.
If the accused is declared guilty, a permanent sum-
mary of the case will be made by the Secretary in
addition to the tape recording. All such information
is considered highly confidential.

III. Rights of the Accused

Golfers Beat UR;
Meet H-S Today

By DAVE OLSON

This afternoon the Washington and
Lee Golf Team teed off against
Hampden-Sydney at the Boonsboro
Country Club in Lynchburg. The
Generals hoped to record their sec-
ond win against no losses after
Tuesday’s victory over Richmond (12-
9).

In Tuesday's match at the Lexing-
ton Golf Club, W&L was led by
junior Dick Singletary, who shot a
75 playing in the number two posi-
tion. He was followed by Ken Carter,
who had a 76, and Jim Gordon, who
shot a 78. Captain Gary Silverfield,
seniors Bill MeCleod, and Bob Mat-
thews, and freshman Bill Martin all
contributed to the W&L win. Last
year’s seventh man, sophomore John
Gunner, will be unable to play for
about a week due to a knee injury
incurred over spring vacation.

With last year’s top seven back
and the introduction of six freshmen,
the prospects for this season and for

Win Over EMC

By WALT POTTER

W&L’s “Hurrin’ Harriers” started
off their season in devasting fashion
Thursday afternoon by thoroughly
trouncing Eastern Mennonite, 103-42,
on rain dampened Wilson Field.

The General trackmen shook off
the intermittent showers of the gloomy
day to build up a commanding lead
in the field events and then put it
away with strong performances in
the running events.

record highlighted the Big Blue's
performance in the field events. Bill
Kahn took the long jump and triple
jump with leaps of 19° 10” and 40’
104", respectively, and Robbie Faust
won the rain shortened pole vault at
10 feet and tied for the high jump
victory with teammates John Glace
and Mike Neer at 5’ 6”. Doug Deaton
broke his own school mark in the
discuss with a toss of 142’ 66”, as
well as taking third in the shot put.
Ben Williams captured first in the
shot with a heave of 43’ 6”. He
also took a second in the discus.
Max Brantly, another promising
freshman, completed the Generals’
sweep of the two events with a third
in the discus and a second in the
shot.

The javelin throwers rounded out
the W&L dominance of the field
events with another sweep as Mike
Carrere, Charlie Freret, and Jay
Passavant captured the first three
places, respectively.

In the running events co-captain
Sam Hinkle led the way. Hinkle won
the 440 yard run in 51.9, ran the
anchor leg on the winning 440 yard
relay team, and almost pulled another
win for the Big Blue in the mile
relay by making up 20 yards in
his leg to almost catch the Eastern
Mennonite harrier.

Drew Thomas excelled for W&L
in the hurdles by winning the inter-
mediate 440 yard hurdles event and
copping a second in the 120 yard
highs. In the distances Harry Zelif
turned in another strong perform-
ance, picking up two second place
finishes behind two very strong East-
ern Mennonite runners, who ran
times of 9:44.1 and 4:35.7 in the
two mile and mile respectively. Bob
Jensen rounded out the fine General
performance in the distance events
posting a 2:03 time in winning the
half mile.

The Big Blue looked good in the

W&L Nine, 5- 3,
Meet Oneonta

The Washington and Lee baseball
team will try to add two wins to their
record today and tomorrow at 3:05
p.m. against Oneonta State after suf-
fering an unhappy homecoming from
Florida Tuesday.

In the Tuesday contest, W&L man-
aged only one hit off Emory and
Henry ace righthander Fred Wagner.
The hit came in the sixth inning
when Jack Baizley ran his hitting
streak to four games. Baizley’s hit
kept alive a short rally that later
scored John Nolan for W&L’s lone
run, However, this was not enough
to overcome a three-run Emory and
Henry lead. The final score was 3-1,
with the General losing their third
game in eight decisions.

W&L completed its most success-

enough to provide a convincing vic-

Eligible To Compete In Contest

The Third Annual Ring-tum Phi-
sponsored Goshen Classic Tubing
Contest will be held Saturday, April
26, according to an announcement
made this week by meet director
Jerry Perlman.

In announcing the date of the
event, Perlman said that additional
information concerning the contest
would be released shortly, although
he did say that only one major
change in its format has been in-
troduced,

The Classic will once again be held
on the tricky 2.3 mile course at
Goshen Pass on the Maury River,
navigated last year in the record time
of 32:00 minutes by Ed Mathews of
Newport News.

Like last year, the contest will
once more consist of three separate
events: the President’s Trophy Race
for members of the Washington and

Lee faculty and administration; the
Powderpuff Sweepstakes for girls
only; and the Downriver Grand

Slalom, which, for the first time, will
be open to students from all NCAA
colleges and universities.

ful spring trip in many years last
week. The team compiled a 3-2 record
in games against three different
schools,

In the first game on Saturday,
March 29, Wilmington College (N.C.)
defeated the Generals, 2-0, on a three-

hitter. However, W&L bounced back
on Monday to defeat Florida Pres-
byterian College, 9-5, as the home

team made eight errors.

Tuesday, April 2, the Generals
split a doubleheader, losing to Aurora
College of Illinois, 5-1, in the first
game and winning the second game
against Florida Presbyterian, 7-1. In
the morning contest the baseballers
lost the services of co-captain Thom

Mitchell for about two weeks. Mit-
chell sustained a tendon injury.
Before his injury, Mitchell had |

run his pitching record to 2-1 with

his outstanding win against Florida
Presbyterian the day before. Fresh-
man right-hander Bill Miller got

credit for Tuesday's win over Florida
Presbyterian, going all the way while

Committee Rejects Exam Proposal

The faculty, meeting last Monday
night, rejected the proposal of Staman

carried, would have provided for the
selection by students, within reason-
able bounds, of the time and date
when they would take their various
final examinations.

According to Dean Pusey, the mo-
tion was defeated only after the
faculty had given “careful considera-
tion to the pros and cons of the pro-
posal.”

Ogilvie was present at the meeting
by invitation, and presented a state-
ment, after which he was questioned
by various members of the faculty.
Following this, the vote was taken.
Had the motion carried, it would not
have gone into effect until the first
semester of next year.

BLACK UNITY

The Lexington High School Student
Organization for Black Unity will
present “The Black Voice,” a black
musical production this weekend. The
Troubadour Theatre will host three
performances tonight and Saturday
night at 8:00 and Sunday afternoon
at 4:30. Admission will be fifty cents,

The performances, entirely student
directed and cast, include both poetry,

music, and dance selected by the
students as representative of black
culture.
