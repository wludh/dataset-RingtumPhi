By PETE HENDRICKS
Executive Committee Member

In the Tuesday, October 22 edition
of the Ring-tum Phi there appeared
a letter to the editor by Leslie Smith
criticizing the recent stand taken by
the Executive Committee on a pro-
posal made by Steve Sandler con-
cerning EC adoption of a statement
similar to the one sanctioned by the
IFC on the matter of housing dis-
crimination in the Lexington com-
munity with regard to girls from
neighboring schools, Having been
quite vocal in my Opposition to this
proposal, | would like to express my
reasons for having opposed its pas-
sage in the hopes that Mr, Smith
and others will be able to glean a
more lucid view of the issue in its
composite form.

I would like to premise my sub-
sequent statements upon the factual
backdrop which was presented to the
EC at the time of the proposal as to
the efforts which had already been
spent by the IFC in dealing with the
problem. The EC was told that a
substantial majority of the hostesses
in Lexington which do keep girls for
students on weekends had been ques-
tioned as to their individual stand on
the matter. The information gathered
from these inquiries revealed that the
major portion of these hostesses in
Lexington would discriminate when
accepting girls into their homes for
any given weekend, However, it was
reported to the EC that a number
of hostesses would not so discrimi-
nate and that the IFC had compiled
a reference list available upon in-
quiry as to those hostesses not ex-
ercising discrimination.

Thus it is seen that Mr. Smith is
in blatant factual error when he
glibly states that the EC refused to
aid the IFC in compiling such a
list. At the time Steve Sandler's pro-
posal came before the EC, the list
referred to had already been realized
through the commendable efforts of
a few individuals. | would like to
here note that had the Executive
Committee been asked to initially help
in forming this list, | personally
would have encouraged EC involve-
ment. It is the state of contrast be-
tween the existence of a very real
problem in this area and what in
fact has been done to at least ease
if not hopefully solve the problem
which is crucial to an appreciation
of the stand taken by the EC on
the question at hand.

it was a fact realized by the EC
that a very real problem had existed
as to the discriminatory practices of
certain hostesses in Lexington with
regard to the lodging of students’
dates on weekends. Several of the
neighboring girls’ schools acted on
their own during the summer moni!
and contacted all these hostesses in
Lexington which they respectively
approved asking them directly if they
would discriminate in accepting girls
for lodging.

From these inquiries, lists were pre-
pared and made available to the stu-
dents of these schools indicating those
hostesses which would not accordingly
discriminate. Additionally, while at-
tending the fall VASG Conference at
Randolph-Macon Women's College
last week, I specifically brought to
the attention of all those member
girls’ schools the fact that a listing
could be obtained through the Wash-
ingion and Lee IFC indicating those

hostesses in Lexington not practicing | sibility of snow flurries or rain.

discrimination in the housing of girls
on weekends.

Having viewed the combined ef-
forts of the IFC and the women’s
colleges in the area, it appeared to
me that the initial problem had been
appropriately dealt with as evidenced
by the fact that information is now
available as to those hostesses in Lex-
ington that will not practice discrimi-
nation such that the unfortunate inci-
dent experienced by a member of
this student body, to which Mr. Smith
referred in his letter, will not be re-
peated in the future.

However, it is only to the point
of making such a listing available to
all those desiring it that | would en-
courage any sanctioning by the EC.
Our neighboring girls’ schools have
the privilege to drop any hostess
from their approved lists for reasons
of discrimination if they so desire.
Additionally, the individual student
at Washington and Lee can imple-
ment a boycott of those hostesses
which discriminate if he so chooses.
Thus, with the above considerations
having been made, in the final analy-
sis the paradoxical import of Steve
Sandler's proposal as lauded by Mr.
Smith needs to be examined.

Were the EC to have passed Steve
Sandler's proposal on this issue it
would itself have executed an action
extremely detrimental to the Univer-
sity community. The hostesses in Lex-
ington have individually determined
for themselves whether or not to
practice discrimination in their hous-
ing. By their actions, the individual
student as well as his date have the
prerogative to either patronize those
hostesses so discriminating or not to
patronize them. For the EC to have
passed a proposal asking that girls
only patronize those hostesses not ac-
cordingly discriminating would have
resulted in denying to the student his
own exercise of rationale concerning
the problem.

Without qualification, 1 feel that
the passage of such a proposal would
have seriously stifled that movement
within the individual student to de-
velop his own ability to form a basis
upon which to make moral judgments
which, if | am not greatly mistaken,
is one of the primary aims of the
liberal arts college such as Wash-
ingion and Lee.

in conclusion, | would like to stress
the point that while the pace for
change in the social conditions exist-
ing on this campus might not be as
quick as some would like for it to
be. there exists a genuine concern

 

for what needs to be done. The re-
sulting solutions which stem from
problems that arise, such as the one
under discussion, will be tempered
with reasoning earnestly striving for
the betterment of the University as)
a whole. I only sincerely hope that |
this University community will never
permit itself to remedy a problem
such that the cure is far more detri-
mental to its healthy grwoth than was |
the original ailment,

The IFC last night again passed a
motion which endorsed the Hosford-
Stovall plan of limited contact as the
best plan within the bounds of the
faculty’s resolution, but emphatically
supported the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
plan which is a half-semester limited
contact plan.

This motion was the formal direc-
tion of the IFC to President Clark
Carter for his presentation of the
IFC’s deferred rush plan next Mon-
day. It followed a presentation by
Danny Leonard of both the Hosford-
Stovall plan and the Tuesday Ring-
tum Phi plan.

In other action, the IFC was activ-
ely urged to support a blood drive
December 12, when the bloodmobile
will make its first appearance on the
W&L campus since 1963. W&L stu-
dents have been the lowest contribu-
tors of blood in the Lexington area
for many years. It is planned to award
a keg of beer to that fraternity which
has the largest percentage of its mem-
bership donate blood.

Dean Atwood noted that there had
been much trouble over the last week-
end with out-of-town students. He
said that many townspeople, mistake
these students for W&L students and
as such, do not help the image of
the W&L student with the Lexing-
ton townspeople. He asked that the
student body help him in finding out
who these people are and what school
they are from so that they may be
properly disciplined.

In the debate over the deferred
rush proposals, the major obstacles
in the Hosford-Stovall plan was the
lack of fraternity revenue during the
first semester while still supporting,
partially, the social life of the fresh-
man class.

Clark Carter reported that there
will be another meeting this Thursday
between the IFC spokesmen and the
faculty Executive Committee; the pur-
pose of the meeting will be to decide
whether the Executive Committee will
endorse the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
plan as the best for W&L or whether
it will allow the plan to go to the
faculty without endorsement. The

 

Tuesday Ring-tum Phi plan is not

Mid-semester rush
urged in IFC vote

within the bounds of the faculty
resolution in that it allows for pledg-
ing after mid-semester.

In other debate on deferred rush,
a motion was introduced, and then
dropped, urging the selection com-
mittee for dorm counselors work
under the guiding criterion of dis-
tributing the dorm counselors out
among the 18 fraternities. Dean At-
wood made it clear that this would
tend to decrease the level of the dorm
counselors if the University was re-
quired to select one member from
each fraternity. It was also noted
that any counselor who would be
obviously using his position to rush
would be replaced.

The IFC also passed a motion
which again outlawed formal sum-
mer rush publications. The minimum
gpr requirement for pledging was
lowered from 2.0 to 1.5 in that the
2.0 level would eliminate over 100
freshmen from eligibility.

University memorial
established in honor
of Lee McLaughlin

The establishment of a memorial
scholarship honoring former head
football coach Lee McLaughlin was
announced on October 26. President
Robert E. R. Huntley, who made
the announcement, stated, “There
could be no more fitting memorial to
Lee McLaughlin than one which as-
sists and honors outstanding young
men.”

The McLaughlin scholarship will
be awarded to a rising junior with
an above-average academic record
who embodies the qualities of char-
acter and dedication exemplified by
Coach McLaughlin and will be held
by this student during his junior and
senior years. Considerations for the
scholarship wil linclude the student's
success in extra-curricular activities,
his relations with his fellow man, his
devotion to Washington and Lee, and
his atributes of sportsmanship and

Nixon-Agnew win easy victory
in mock presidential election

By ROBERT H. YEVICH

The man who easily captured the
nomination of his party in the Mock
Convention six months ago, Richard
M. Nixon, continued his winning
streak on the W&L campus yesterday,
In The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi’s presi-

double the number of votes of the

Humphrey and Edmund Muskie.

In analyzing the results of the bal-
loting, Nixon’s sweep of 59.7 per cent
of the total vote stands as an un-
questionable majority. Breaking down
the results according to classes,
Nixon maintained a majority in the

graduate classes with the exception
of the senior class. The successful

A somewhat diminishing appetite for VASG

By JAY PASSAVANT
Student Body President

On October 22, Tuesday of last
week, five members of the Washing-
ton and Lee student body attended a
fall conference sponsored by the Vir-
ginia Association of Student Govern-
ments. The all-day conference was
held at Randolph-Macon Women’s
College and was the first major meet-
ing of the VASG this year. The five
members of the student body repre-
senting W&L were Rob Bauer and
Pete Hendricks of the Executive Com-
mittee, Reed Byrum of the Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi, Dave Stovall, social
chairman of the IFC, and myself.

A one word description of the
day's proceedings would be simple—

waste. After a luncheon and a 35-
minute speech by Mills Godwin, gov-
ernor of Virginia, which turned out to
be a promotional effort for the 81-
million-dollar bond issue, the dele-
gates broke into sub-committee to
discuss various topics of interest. The
report of each one of our delegates
was the same—a definite lack of
organization and a lack of anything
useful coming out of the meeting.
Without exception, each delegate felt
his time would have been better spent
at WAL.

Perhaps the worst disaster of the
day was averted when member col-
leges voted 10-9 against a proposal
that would have given public sup-
port of the Governor's Bond Issue.

(Continued on Page 4)

 

Republican showed his greatest
strength in the freshman class polling
two out of every three freshman
votes for 211 of 325 votes cast.

Among the faculty Nixon did not
fare so well. In faculty balloting the
Humphrey-Muskie ticket claimed 24
of 42 votes for 57 per cent of those
voting. Nixon received support from
16 faculty members (38 per cent of
those voting), with the remaining two
faculty votes going to George Wallace
and to a write-in candidate.

Judging from the results of this
preferential poll, the roots of Nixon’s
support in the student body are im-
beded deep in the freshman class
where he wielded a 4-1 edge over
Humphrey. This poll also indicated a
decreasing amount of pro-Nixon sup-
port with each step up the academic
ladder.

Nixon's poorest backing among the
students showed up in senior class
balloting: he fell just short of winning
a majority. The law school displayed
rejuvenated sentiment on behalf of
Nixon, who won 58 per cent of the
law school ballots.

Independent Party candidate
George Wallace expectedly made a
poor showing taking only 6.6 per cent
of the ballots. Wallace's supporters
seemed evenly spaced throughout the
student body on a 1 to 14 ratio.

The 8.6 per cent who voted for
write-in candidates displayed a wide
variety of opinion. McCarthy led the
write-ins with 21, followed not too
far behind by the menacing Pat
Paulsen with 15. Dick Gregory and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller captured 13
and 7 write-in votes respectfully.

The remaining 24 write-ins were
scattered among eleven candidates
ranging from President Johnson to
Edward Kennedy, from William Buck-
ley to Eldridge Cleaver, and from
Gen. Westmoreland to Gov. Reagan.

By REED BYRUM
Managing Editor

W&L must re-evaluate its member-
ship in VASG, as the old criticisms
that came to a head last Spring have
once again been reclaimed, but now
more justifiably and rightfully than
ever.

Admittedly, this is a young organi-
zation, one with excellent ideals and
potential; but also one that has gained
the approval of most private and pub-
lic colleges throughout Virginia. With
this acceptance it claims almost awe-
striking power in its youth and it is
boldly asserting with youthful ex-
uberance its new found power, much
to the possible discredit and the real-

 

istic disapproval of its participants.

Alumni Association head

Who is he? William C. Washburn,
Executive Secretary of Washington

rated. What does he do? He over-
sees the operations of the Alumni
Association. Why do so few people
see him? He's usually visiting some of
the forty-eight active alumni chapters
in the country.

Mr. Washburn’s schedule for the

next month is quite rigorous. He

includes a visit to Chicago on the
eighth of November, to Cleveland on

will also visit Baltimore on the thir-

Mr. Washburn and President Huntley

Little do people realize the amount
of work concerned with the admini-

The association publishes the Alumni
Magazine and keeps in correspond-
ence with the 12,000 alumni in the
country. If is also concerned with
fund drive,
which includes around 100 class
agents and 150 regional agents, and
Homecoming Weekend and the class
reunions, The association was respon-
sible for the special program con-
ducted last year in which returning
members from the various alumni
chapters were given an intensive three-
day training program concerning the
purpose of the University and the
direction in which it is headed.

Relations with the alumni are im-
portant, according to Mr. Washburn.
lt is through the alumni that the de-
velopment of the University continues.
The New Science building was built
through organized alumni campaigns.
Also important is the interest that the
alumni chapters instill in prospective
freshman from their area by introduc-
ing WAL to high school students and
in helping them with admission.

 

LETTERS TO THE

Henberg takes exception
with Tuesday editorial

EDITOR

aw

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

I am writing in response to an
editorial in last Tuesday’s Ring-tum
Phi which cited the lack of student
influence in decisions by the faculty
and administration. I admit to a
similar distress in many instances,
particularly where student academic
standards and requirements are con-
cerned. Under current circumstances
there are many times I feel domi-
nated by an impersonal voice boom-
ing, “You shall do this for the sake
of doing it.”

Therefore | support programs aim-
ed at better allowing student opinion
to be felt and expressed. For instance
I share the belief that students should
be allowed to sit on both the Ex-
ecutive Committee of the Faculty and
the Committee on Courses and De-
grees. To the point, however, it is
not with the spirit of Mr. Honig’s
editorial I take exception; I object
rather to his choice of the Student
Curriculum Committee as a concrete
example.

On a factual level, everything said
in the editorial is true. The commit-
tee has no actual power other than
in the form of recommendations to
the faculty Curriculum Committee.
In essence, however, even the faculty
committee has no power other than
recommendation to the faculty as a
whole.

It was called to my attention that
last Tuesday's editorial has been con-

Lynchburg plan fails

to solve current flaws

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Recently the faculty took the first
step toward a five day week. In a
special meeting it voted to consider
the implementation of the so-called
Lynchburg plan.

The Lynchburg plan offered the
plan of least resistance. It entails no
block scheduling changes and margi-
nal adjustments in actual class meet-
ing times.

Its simplicity, however, is all the
Lynchburg plan possesses to recom-
mend it. There has been little attempt
to take this opportunity to examine
the whole of the present class schedul-
ing plan in terms of general academic
life.

There is a major flaw in the cur-
rent system which will be perpetuated
and probably worsened. That is that
fifty percent of the upper level-single-
meeting block courses, over one hun-
dred in number, are scheduled in
three blocks E, F, and G. The Lynch-
burg plan will make the “undesir-
able” early morning hours earlier
and late morning hours later there-
by making the “desirable” middle
hours more so.

For any new courses, a small num-
ber of course offerings are inherent

No matter what the final disposition of a five-day week
may be, we as students can take pride in the fact that a plan
supported by us has been favorably received by the faculty.
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi plan is not the best alternative
to a six-day week—more sweeping changes in the schedule
are certain to be considered in the future. But for the time
being, the Tuesday plan seems to have less criticism than
any other before the faculty and could provide (as soon as
next semester) a pleasant and delightful change in the cur-
riculum,

The Dance Board

For all its circumlocutions in recent days, the Dance
Board has yet to formulate any policy designed to increase
its income substantially—an achievement which, as the
Board well knows, needs to be accomplished. The Dance
Board is not in an ideal situation, however, to remedy the
situation. It faces what has become a dilemma almost with-
out solution, as students want the big names in current en-
tertainment, but names for whom the asking price escalates
exponentially, ;

We remember two years ago, when the fare for the four
big weekends included the Four Tops, the Temptations,
Dionne Warwick, Chuck Jackson, Sam and Dave, Chuck
Berry, the Tams, and Peter Duchin. Such a lineup this year
would cost about twice as much as the Board’s total budget,
exclusive of decorations and back-up groups. It may well
be that big entertainment at Washington and Lee will be-
come limited to one or two weekends a year. We're already
down to one night's worth of concert per dance set, instead
of the customary two,

despite the dearth of possible remedies. Each year the Uni-
versity is asked to integrate fees for parties into tuition col-
lection—a request which is turned down, with good cause.
Prices of dance plan cards have been raised, necessarily,
but the trend cannot be continued for very long. This year,
the Board sought to coerce increased dance plan purchases
by stipulating the plans were non-transferable, which stipula-
tion was unwisely removed the day before the Openings
concert.

What, then, can the Dance Board do to continue for as
long as possible to bring showmen to W&L? We offer
some suggestions, made in consideration of the Board's
position and with the best interests of the student body in
mind:

—Abolish Finals weekend. This concert series is attend-
ed by about one-fourth of the students, and is given at a
time when the desire to stay for the concert is too often
outweighed by inconvenience and a desire to go home after
examinations,

—End “University” cocktail parties as we now know
them, substituting a less expensive mode of entertainment.
These parties, where poor drinks are usually served, are
financed by class dues, which money could be routed to the
Dance Board. Then the Board could furnish a combo for
the parties, leaving liquor consumption up to the discretion
and the budgets of the students.

Allow the sale of dance plans at any point in the year,
for a pro-rated share of cost plus 20 per cent after Openings
and 30 per cent after Fancy Dress (an incentive to buy
early).

Allow admission sales of guest tickets at the door to non-
students.

Allow students to be admitted to concerts, at the
door, for the price of a guest ticket plus 30 per cent.

need be done (and it has not yet been done, to our knowl-
edge) to insure that each W&L student has properly gained
admittance is to ask, at the door, “Are you a W&L student?”
If so, “Is this your dance plan?” or “May I check which
type of ticket you have?” In this way, the Dance Board has
1) encouraged the early purchase of dance plans (presum-
ably, the summer-purchase discount would be continued) ;
2) allowed for those who decide to attend at the last minute;
3) made provisions for those students who cannot afford a
dance plan early in the year; 4) made it possible to attend
only one or two concerts (though the cost to the student
would be greater); and 5) encouraged attendance by non-
W&L students (from the University of Virginia and else-
where) by allowing at-the-door admission sales.

The Dance Board may legitimately object that some of
these suggestions inhibit its ability to pre-collect for the
budget. The Board should, however, be able to forecast
adequately how many will attend each series. The limitations
here are not severe. Some objections may be voiced by the
student body; but a choice must be made. In future years,
our unnecessary expenditures for cocktail parties and the
unjustified continuance of Finals will relegate big weekends
at W&L to little more than shadows of the gaiety and excite-
ment they once were,

Beaters duadinched by Héliies in
final pertod on disputed penalty

Poor teamwork led to a 2-2 double
overtime tie for the W&L soccer
team, against VPI on Friday. AIl-
though the Generals didn’t play well,
they did outplay the Hokies who man-
aged the stalemate through poor
officiating.

The Blue got off to a good start
in the first half. Fred Fletcher scored
the first goal for the home team in
the first quarter, and Jack Horowitz
added another in the second quarter.
But the Gobblers managed to get back
one of the goals toward the end of
the half.

Virginia Tech tied things up in the
final quarter on a disputed call. A
penalty shot was called against Don
Belt for tripping inside the goal

 

 

crease. Not only was the call a doubt-
ful one, but the penalty imposed was
incorrect. For such an offense, VPI
should either have been awarded an
indirect shot from inside the crease,
or a direct one from the outside.
Instead the Hokies were given a direct
shot from inside the crease, and a
score followed.

The game had to be dishearten-
ing for the Generals. Despite several
periods of fine play, they continu-
ally turned into individuals playing a
team game. Too many long kicks
were made instead of working the
ball up to the linemen. The backs
played poorer than usually, with the
fullbacks experiencing their worst
game of the season.

football Generals trounced Bridge-

the season. The Eagles presented no

problem at all, as a freezing Open-

to a 27-13 victory.

W&L was off and running from
the beginning. On the first series of
plays, Bridgewater had the ball on
their forty at second and fourteen.
Halback Greg Klauck bulled into the
middle of the tine and fumbled.

Taking in a punt on the 38, he ran
it back to the W&L 48 before he was
stopped. The gutsy back had to be
carried off the field, after gaining
64 yards in eight carries.

The Eagles threw a scare into the :

Bethlehem Steel
Loop Course Interviews:

with bachelors’ or advanced degrees.

  
   

NOVEMBER

What is the Bethlehem Loop Course? It is our management development program for graduates

The course starts early in July with four weeks of orientation at our home offices in Bethlehem,

Pa. Loopers attend lectures on every phase of the corporation's activities, and make almost daily

visits to a steel plant.

Steel Plant Loopers, who comprise a majority of the average loop class of 150 to 200 graduates,
proceed to various plants where they go through a brief orientation program before beginning
their on-the-job training assignments, Within a short time after joining the course, most loopers
are ready for assignments aimed toward higher levels of management.

How about other loopers? Our Sales Department loopers (30 or so) remain at the home office for
about a year of training. Most are then assigned to district offices where they take over established

accounts,

Fabricated Steel Construction loopers are trained in a drafting room, on a field erection project,
in a fabricating shop, and in an engineering office. A looper's first work assignment is based on
interests and aptitudes disclosed during this program.

Loopers in Accounting, Shipbuilding, Mining, Research, Traffic, Purchasing, Finance and Law,
General Services, and Industrial and Public Relations go through training programs tailored to

their types of work.
