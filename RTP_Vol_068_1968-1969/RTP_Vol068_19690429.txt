‘The way

I see it’

(Editor’s note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic.)

By BRUCE DOWNING

During this, the last semester of
my college career, | have often been
struck by the discrepancy in treat-
ment of the seniors and freshmen on
this campus. The freshmen are given
special treatment, “assimilated” into
college by the experience/ordeal of
Freshman Camp, a recpetion on the
lawn, and a series of thoughtful, en-
lightening talks by prominent mem-
bers of the faculty.

My favorite among these gems was
that on “The Next Four Years,” a
description of what our college life
would be like. If the freshmen get
all this attention, why isn’t there a
similar lecture for the seniors on
“The Last Four Years” which would
sum up our useful and happy years
at W&L. It would serve as a proper
sequel to the original. And so many
changes have occurred on this campus
during the last four years that some
comment would seem appropriate.

But, of course, for the class of °69,
no such summation is necessary. That
lecture during our freshman year was
so complete and so accurate that
another one would be mere repitition.
Why, I can still hear the words of
the great Dean now...

“First, gentlemen (and you are
gentlemen), I would like to give you
some advice. Don't worry about all
this talk and bother about the speak-
ing tradition and the dress tradition.
During your four years, both of
these will be done away with as
obsolete replicas of the past. I just
hope that you all didn’t believe that
propaganda we or the College Townie
Shop sent you during the summer.
As for the speaking tradition, the less
said, the better.

“And | want to apologize for the
rough academic schedule that you
will go through this year. But don't
worry, very soon the POF System
(Pass or Fail) will be in effect. Start-
ing in your junior year, the progres-
sive faculty plan to eliminate all
grades, a la The Hopkins.* And by
that year you should be free to go
down to the Briah on Friday night,
when our progressive faculty abolishes
those nasty reminders or our glori-
ous past: Saturday classes.

*That should be lot of POF's (you
may laugh, gentlemen).

“| must apologize again to those
of you who have affiliated with a
fraternity, You will be threatened
periodically with the spectre of de-
ferred rush because you will be,
naturally, negative influences on this
campus (at this point cheers from
the Beta section). But don't worry,
no matter how bad it looks, the
faculty is only trying to scare you.
To be truthful, we wouldn't know
what to do with the freshmen any-
way, even if we got them...

“Yes and there will be lots more
changes during “The Next Four
Years.” We will get two new student
unions—yes, I said two, count ‘em,
two: the second and best will be
open in 1967, of is it 1968 oF 1969,
Well. at least you will see it as
alumni. And will have curriculum
revision and the short semester, again
due to our progressive faculty, in
1968 of is it 1969. And we will have
a new gym by 1969 too (or is it...)
And the school will be a national
leader in adopting coeducation (as in
girls) in time for your senior year,
vou lucky devils. Of course some of
these progressive reforms may be de
layed, but all will be ready in time
for your graduation

“Yet don't despair.—everything will
not change during the “Next Four
Years.” | am sure, with your active
support, continuity and tradition will
reign supreme. Why even now, as
I stand here, one of the outstanding
members of your class, Gross John
son, is sharing himself with others
(and vice versa) in the distinguished
tradition of that great alumnus,
Arthur Huntley Reid.”

Economic restraint urged

by ex-Secretary H.

In Lee Chapel last night Henry
H. Fowler, former Secretary of the
Treasury, gave his first formal ad-
dress since leaving the cabinet in
December. Fowler’s talk was an
evaluation of the apparent trends of
the Nixon administration in the areas
of monetary policy, tax reform, and
international finance.

He cited five areas in which the
Nixon Administration had continued
the basic policies of the Johnson era.
They include Nixon’s desire to slow

successful fiscal policy tool, and to
discard it now would be harmful to
the economy. Fowler was also oppos-
ed to the advocated reduction in the
surtax from 10 per-cent to 5 per-cent.

In closing his talk, the former
Treasury Secretary had two proposals.
First, he urged a “strong ‘hold-the-
line’ position on existing policies of
fiscal and monetary restraint to mini-
mize the risk of any return to a
situation of an excess of demand con-
tributing to inflation.” Second, he

Fowler

urged the use of voluntary restraint
on the part of business and labor to
absorb the cost increases that are
fueling the cost-push inflation, which
| in his opinion is at the heart of the
| U.S.’s present inflationary problems.

Fowler's talk was the second an-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Aconversation with the President

(Below is an interview with President Robert E. R. Huntley,
obtained for The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi by Assisant Edi-
torial-Page Editor Glenn Azuma, a freshman from New
Milford, N. J. This edition expresses to President Huntley
sincere thanks for his time and patience in granting the
interview.—Ed. )

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi: In the past several months cer-
tain developments in the University, such as the proposed
curriculum changes and association with Hollins, Randolph-
Macon, Hampden-Sydney, Sweet Briar College, and Davidson,
have been discussed. In light of these developments we would
like to know what you feel are the immediate and long range
outlooks for Washington and Lee.
President Huntley: That’s a broad question.

Do you mean specifically in regard to curriculum and co-
education?
R-t Phi: Yes. I think coupled with this question might be that
of the future of the small independent college in America.
Since it seems that the fate of the small institution in the United

States is that of our school.

Pres. Huntley: There are a great many people who have
pointed out that small institutions like Washington and Lee
are going to have increasing difficulty, principally financially
in the years ahead. I don’t think anyone knows the exact
extent to which that is true. I obviously don’t anticipate that
Washington and Lee’s financial troubles are going to put it

out of business.

I do feel very strongly (and I think that my feeling is
shared by all others on the faculty here) that the role of an
institution like Washington and Lee is that of a predominantly

Before beginning my weekly
tirade, 1 would like to take this
opportunity to second the thoughts
of young Larry in an editorial he
wrote last week. At a time when
too many students, including me.
had become disillusioned with stu-
dent government at Washington and

year by Jay Passavant as Presi-
dent of the Executive Committee
has done much to restore confi-
dence in our student leaders,

McDowell probably presented the only
campaign speech in the annals of Lex-
ington history for which the entire
listening audience was able to sil
around the Rockbridge Courthouse
conference table. The audience of ten
included Bob Hawthorne of VMI,
local chairman of the YAF, three
other Vimies, Hawthorne's girl friend
and his father, two reporters, the head
of the W&L YAF, and a W&L YR
member who was there because he
had to lock up the courthouse after-
wards.

McDowell's remarks sounded like
the type of outlandish conservative
doctrine that Mad Magazine would
dream up if it wanted to mock the
Far Right. On several occasions, |
was tempted to say “You've got to
be kidding.”

McDowell supports the Liberty

federal income tax because “when
the central government taxes people

teaching institution with a relatively low enrollment and a
relatively high teacher-student ratio. The emphasis as I have
said is principally on teaching as distinguished from research,
contract research and so forth. The role of this institution is
going to be more important than it has been in the past be-
cause it is going to be rarer in the future than in the past.

The pressures certainly have been(over the past decade
and probably will be over the next decade or more) to abandon
this objective. These pressures are from many sources. Pres-
sure from circumstances is going to be in the direction of
much enlarged enrollments, large graduate affiliations, signi-
ficant contract research and other kinds of research affiliated
with the graduate institution.

Those have been the pressures since World War II and
I see no reason to believe that they will let up in the years
ahead. This leads me to conclude that the role Washington
and Lee can fulfill will be more important rather than less
important in the years ahead.

I do not think there is no place for the large, principally
graduate-oriented university. There obviously is; in fact it is
clear that quantitatively and in some areas qualitatively such

institutions will play the major role in the future.

However, it seems to me equally clear that American
higher education will have lost, and lost irreplaceably, a great
deal if the institutions of this size and our goals are squeezed
out. We should be able to offer some distinctive educational
advantages, different from the kind which can be achieved
at a large university. The principal emphasis is that there are
going to be different opportunities offered in a school like
this and in my view they will be better in many cases.

It seems to me desirable that there be an element of di-
versity in our higher education. I would hate to see a single
pattern emerge in American higher education ten years from
now. I believe that has been the direction of things for the
last twenty years and so I see it as more important than ever
that a school like Washington and Lee work hard at achieving
the ideas of a cohesive student-faculty situation.

We feel the need for, as is expressed in the Curriculum
Committee report, a revised schedule for distribution require-
ments and major requirements in some cases. Our objective
is to allow the individual student a wider measure of choice.
In some respects the issues of co-education, a diverse cur-
riculum, small size and less stringent course requirements tug
againt each other.

It is difficult to retain a large, diverse curriculum and
faculty with a small student body, economically as well as
sometimes pedagogically.

R-t Phi: Wouldn't you say one of the main problems is of a
financial nature?

Pres. Huntley: I’d say that it is an economic problem in the
broadest sense of that term. Financial being one aspect of
“economic” as I am using the term. Even if one had no real
problem of sources of dollars—and that will never be the
case—but if one did there would still be a felt need to be
able to justify to one’s self, as well to other sources of dollars,
that you are spending these funds in a reasonably efficient man-
ner. I suggest that such a need will be felt by anyone who
administers any institution.

It is obviously economically more difficult for an institution
of 1,400 to 1,500 to maintain a curriculum with a large num-
ber of courses than it is for an institution of 15,000.

The desire to broaden the curriculum does at some point
run counter to the desire to remain small. Thus I think we
have been able to manage a fairly good compromise between
these two opposite forces. I assume we can continue to do that,
yet we have got to be continuously aware of the problem.

The desire to afford the student a wider measure of choice
could result in a concentration of students in a fairly narrow
area of the curriculum, One of the purposes of required courses
is to guarantee a certain spread of the student body through
the curriculum by requiring certain subjects. This in turn
affords at least a minimum guarantee of your ability to offer
a large curriculum.

 

So if you afford, as we want to do, a larger measure of |
choice to the students, you at the same time run the risk of |
the students in a given year or four-year period making choices |

by themselves which tend to concentrate in a narrower area

lot the curriculum and in a sense leave the other parts of the

Curriculum changes found
needed for W&L’s growth

By BOB ENTZMINGER
News Editor, Friday edition

The Faculty Curriculum Committee
recently released a report which sug-
gests three basic changes in our cur-
riculum. Although I wish to concern
myself here primarily with the pro-
posals for reducing distribution re-
quirements, | want first to say that
I feel each of the recommendations
will help alleviate the rigidity pres-
ently imposed by the curriculum and
Il urge their adoption, whatever the
form, on Thursday,

Perhaps to some people the practi-
cal need for a less restrictive cur-
riculum has not been demonstrated.
However, it is clear that W&L has
in recent years suffered a substantial
decline in the number of applica-
tions it receives per year (1599 in
1965 to 1153 in 1968). For the first
time, private institutions are seriously
competing with large state universities
for top students. While it may be
true that curriculum is not a signifi-
cant factor in choosing a college for
the average high school student, it
does appear to be a decisive element
for those top students which W&L
most wants to attract. Clearly large
universities offer many advantages
private institutions cannot afford. The
competitive position of schools like
WAL lies in their ability to provide
flexible curricula and an_ individual
approach to education. The present
set-up at W&L allows for neither.

Included in the committee's report
is a study of the distribution require-
ments of schools comparable to and
competitive with W&L. Almost all
had distribution requirements signific-
antly less than ours, thus offering
the alternative of flexibility to state
schools and thereby increasing their
competitive advantage over WA&L.
Our distribution requirements pres-
ently account for about 55 percent of
the total credits needed for gradua-
tion (assuming no advanced place-
ment), while only U. Va. and Swarth-
more of the schools studied (both
with about 40 percent) approached
this figure, Wesleyan and Swarthmore
have no distribution requirments at
all, and Duke and Davidson waive
them for some students.

Until W&L’s curriculum is made
more competitive with the schools
mentioned and offers a real alterna-
tive to large state universities, it is
likely that applications will decline
not only in number but in percent-
age of top students, Of course, the
solution advocated by the committee
is NO panacea, but it will help signific-
antly.

By reducing the ratio of distribu-
tion requirements to total number of
hours needed for graduation, a stu-
dent may move into his major more
quickly and with more depth, a basic
concern for many high school students
according to Dean Farrar, and for
the sake of a broad education he may
choose electives which really interest
him.

Practical arguments opposing any
changes in distributive requirements
tend to ignore the changing demands
of students, Instead, they focus on
the possible detrimental effects of
making the curriculum less restrictive.
Many fear that some departments,
the maintenance of which we all
agree are necessary, would suffer
great losses of students as a result.
Evidence seems to point to the con-
trary. The School of Journalism has
survived, though its courses meet no
distribution requirement. But even if
some departments suffer temporary
decreases in enrollment, | think it is
erroneous to believe all professors
must teach a full course load to
full classes cach semester. Resources

writing, and more _ individualistic
teaching approaches, endeavors which
would in turn strengthen the depart-
ment and make it more attractive
to successive generations of students.

The philosophical objections raised
to reducing restrictions are that a
broad range of courses, including cer-
tain ones deemed basic by tradition,
are indigenous to a liberal education.
In the first place, the proposed
changes still require a broad range
of course offerings; the number need-
ed is simply reduced. Secondly, the
incorporation of basic courses into
curricula stems from a time when
very few courses of competing vaidity
were available. That is not now the
case. Thirdly as I have previously
stated, secondary schools are now
providing experience in the different
types of learning which these basic
courses were designed to offer.
Finally, it seems to me that W&L
can justify its existence only if it
offers an alternative to the cheaper
multiversity approach to education.
Such an alternative lies only in
W&L’s potential flexibility (unrealized
up to now) and its claim of an indi-
vidualistic approach. Yet the assump-
tion that everyone needs the same
background of courses in essentially
collective, imposing a rigidity which
belies that claim.

There is a problem with defining
the term “liberal education.” If one
takes it to mean that there are certain
things one ought to be acquainted
with (a claim against qualified
validity) the argument for teaching
basic courses holds up, though the
necessity for requiring them on the
college level remains in question. If,
however, you feel, as I do, that the
real goal of a liberal education is
to stimulate curiosity and promote
inquiry into a diverse range of sub-
jects, then requiring courses in which
the student is not interested in funda-
mentally illiberal as it is approached
here, because that requirement tends
to foster a passive approach to the
educational exeperience. This pas-
sivity has long been an issue at W&L,
and I think it is due in large measure
to the stifling effects freshman and
sophomore courses have, not because
they are dull courses in themselves,
but because they are peopled by stu-
dents whose interests lie elsewhere.

A related argument is the one
which Mr. Honig presented in the
Feb. 25 issue of the Ring-tum Phi,
The Tuesday editor fears that allow-
ing students an earlier concentration
in a major would turn W&L into
a “trade school.” Of course, insofar
as it is predominantly engaged in
preparing men for the professions, it
is that already, and I don't believe
Mr. Honig to be against increasing
the professional competence of our
graduates. The basis for his argument
is that one will be incomplete with-
out taking certain courses, a stance
given long-standing validity at W&L.
I feel, on the other hand, that the
graduate is incomplete if he has not
been actively engaged in his own
education, and it is here that I find
WAL deficient. Basic freshman cours-
es no longer inculcate the virtues of
intellectual curiosity, and the passive
approach they do engender is car-
ried into upper level courses.

Clearly, either the minority or
the majority report would help allevi-
ate the problems | described by pro-
viding greater flexibility in the cur-

majority report for several reasons.
In the first place, about 70 percent

THE EDITOR

No health exams?

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:
On Tuesday, April 15, | presented
myself at the WAL Infirmary to have
a simple physical examination done
to present to a graduate school, a
prerequisite to attendance at that
institution, as it is at WAL, The exam
appears simple, to the layman at
least, requiring the measurement of
height, weight, temperature, pulse,
blood pressure, urine, and vision, fol-
lowed by a list of eighteen conditions
which are to be checked normal of
abnormal (such as teeth and head).
I was told by the nurse at the
desk and by Dr. Brush, who was
silting smoking his pipe in the wait-
ing room, that our infirmary no longer
gives these physical examinations, |
think this policy should be challeng-
ed. What is the function of the
infirmary if not to care for the health
needs of students? Ascertaining sick-
ness is surely included in this: a
student should have the same right
to a urinalysis as he does to have a

Our hope is that the student body will be sufficiently di-
verse in its interests and well-advised by faculty advisers and
members of the faculty in general that this kind of concentra-
tion will not occur. That is the ideal and that is what we are
tending to pursue; it remains to be seen how well it will work.

On co-education there are many advantages which may
be pointed to; however, you'll find some argument about
them in almost any group of half a dozen people. Certainly,
advantages do exist. It is to be noted however, that a decision

suspected broken arm examined,
abetes, high blood pressure, heart con-
ditions, certain types of cancer, de-
fective hearing, etc. can only begin
after they are discovered by a physic-
ian, yet these conditions are surely
as dangerous as painful stomach
aches or colds, which can be recogniz-
ed by the patient. This is probably the
reason for schools’ requiring medical
exams at various times; yet the W&L
infirmary seems only to care about

 

to become co-ed is related to decisions concerning size of the
institution and is related less directly to curriculum. The ques-
tions cannot be divorced from each other.

For example if Washington and Lee were to decide to
become co-ed, as might well indeed occur, a decision would
obviously have to be made to what extent to become co-ed,

sion would also have to be made whether that fraction should
be in lieu of a similar number of male students or in addition
to the existing student body.

there was a declining number of students making applications
to Washington and Lee and with this there was seemingly a
lowered entrance standard. What is being done to rectify this
situation?

Pres. Huntley: As Dean Farrar I’m sure pointed out there has
been since about 1965 a decline in the total number of applica-
tions to Washington and Lee at a rate of about 4 to 5 per cent
a year, a fairly nominal change. This is not a change upon

If you took a graph of total applications and started in

On such a graph from 1965 to the present you would find

are twenty-five-fifty higher than last year. A nominal change.

point. The percentage of students enrolled here who were
in the top percentile of their graduating class is virtually
identical to that of 1965.

Part of the decline may be attributable to a declining use
of multiple applications, a result of better guidance counseling.
A part of the reason clearly is the increased percentage of
students in the nation who are attending public institutions
as opposed to private in the past 3-4 years. The causes for
this trend are manifeld, one of them may be tuition differences
and costs.

The extent to which coeducation affects the picture at the
moment is unclear. It is the view of a good many people that
in the past two to three years coeducation or its absence affects
the decisions of more students than it used to. I do not think
there is anything in the figures that you have alluded to which
is significant enough for a cause to panic.

It was not to be expected that the steep incline that
existed from 1950-1965 would continue. We are making more
vigorous recuiting efforts than we have in the past. This is

1965. It is a recognition that as other schools become increas-
ingly active in recruiting efforts it would be very shortsighted
for us not to do the same.

We intend to bring Washington and Lee to the attention
of as many people in as many sections of the country as
possible. The reason for making serious efforts to bring Wash-
ington and Lee to the attention of students is in part to prevent

a part of the student’s health,

The argument I received in the in-
firmary was that there was not enough
time to examine all those who wish
to be examined, yet there has been
an increase in infirmary hours and
a doctor added to the staff, without
a significant increase in number of
students in the last couple of years.
I think it only just that if the per-
sonnel in the infirmary wish to lighten
their work load, then their pay should
be proportionately decreased. The
students have been paying for this
service and I am sure that next semest-
er’s students will gladly deduct any
amount from their tuition,
