Passavant to sit with
Trustee Board Friday

Student Body President Jay Passa-
vant presented his outline of sug-
gestions for the upcoming Board of
Trustees meeting in last night’s Ex-
ecutive meeting. A proposal to form
a new student body committee to
deal with the new Student Union and
a motion to withdraw W&L from the
Virginia Student Government Associa-
tion were also discussed,

will be the non-voting
student body representative to the
Board of Trustees when they meet
Friday in Roanoke. The EC approved
his proposed comments to the Board
—which call for increased University
attention to the dormitory needs of
the students. Passavant will cite the
need for new dorms if co-education
is approved and will also point out
their advantages in the event that
W&L remains a men’s school, He
will point out that it is the EC’s
feeling that new dorms should have
equal priority with a new gym and
a new library.

Passavant

Passavant also plans to discuss the
advantages of co-education, the EC's
current disposition toward the Honor
System, the possibility of establish-
ing a separate Honor Court for the
Law School, and the necessity of im-
proving the University’s stature
through public relations. He further
plans to discuss the University’s ad-
missions policy general with par-
ticular emphasis on the need for
greater student and alumni participa-

tion and the recruitment of black
students.
The EC had intended to interview

applicants for the positions of co-
chairmen of the Mock Convention,
but none of the applicants showed
up. Anyone still wishing to apply for
one of the two positions should con-
tact Judson Simmons at the KA house
sometime this week.

In a talk with Mayor Brady last
week, Passavant was told that the
proposals for the institution of a
property tax on cars and the requir-
ing of town tags will probably not
come up at this Thursday's meeting
as had been planned. Mayor Brady
assured Passavant that in the event
the proposals were not considered
this week, they would not come up
again until the students return in
the fall. Nevertheless, the EC will
still send Freshman Law Representa-
tive Phil Thompson to speak for the
students at the Council meeting in
case the proposals do come up.

The possibility of a new student
committee to Oversee the operations
of the Student Union was considered.
Currently, the Assimilation Commitee
is responsible for the organization of
the Union. One suggestion was that
the Assimilation Committee be re-
dircted premanently along those lines
Another suggestion advocated the
formation of a completely new eight-|
man committee for the job. Discus- |

As Dr. Crenshaw noted in his speech last Friday
some of the most valuable materials to him in this
project were old Virginia newspapers. In particular, he
mentioned the Williamsburg Virginia Gazetic. the old
Lexington Union, the old Lexington Gazette, and sinc
the 1880's the Rockbridge County News. Even research

until next year.

The EC also discussed enforcing
a two dollar student assessment for
the purpose of financing the 1970
Contact. After discussing the wisdom
of the EC’s backing an IFC opera-
tion, it was decided that the chairman
should be interviewed next week to
discover the needs of the program.
The EC has raised funds for the
symposium for the last two years,

At the close of the meeting, Senior-
Intermediate Law Representative Pete
Hendricks moved that the EC with-
draw W&L from the VASG. He
pointed out that the University had
joined the group last year, not be-
cause of its central organization, but
because the VASG's peripheral com-
mittees would be beneficial to W&L
students. At that time there was a
student travel committee being organ-
ized which planned to offer students
reduced fares on flights to Europe.
Nothing has developed of the com-
mittee since December. Hendricks
stated that the other committees of
the VASG were also undeveloped.
Due to his fear that the VASG may
become the political organ of some
gubernatorial candidate, and because
the University has little to gain from
membership in his eyes, he requested
complete withdrawal. The motion will
be discussed further and voted upon
next week.

ames article published
by prestigious journal

International recognition in the art
world was recently received by Dr.
Gerald M. Doyon, Associate Profes
sor of Fine Arts. The Gazette Des
Beaux-Arts, Paris, the oldest and
most prestigious journal in the world
for art history, featured in its Janu-
ary issue an article by Dr. Doyon.

The article, which appeared in the
journal in five languages, concerned
“The Positions of the Panels Decorat
ed by Theodore Chasseriau at the
Former Cour des Comptes in Paris.”

Chasseriau began the operation in
1844, and the finished product repre-
sented four years of arduous labor.
It was the largest mural commission

ever granted to a French artist. Un-
fortunately for art lovers, little of
the original mural still remains. The

building within which the mural was
housed was destroyed by fire in 1871.

Dr. Doyon’s task was
since the mural originally covered
three-thousand square feet and was
populated with over two hundred and
thirty figures. Doyon, whose research
was financed under a grant to France
in 1964, concentrated his efforts to-
word a reconstruction of the ensemble
through forgotten building plans and
through newspaper articles contemp-
orary with tie murals.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion Of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s T'wice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, May 13, 1969

Transition, installment number70

Beginning right now, Bob Yevich assumes the editorship
of this edition of The Ring-tum Phi, and it is with confidence
and warmest wishes for success that we turn the proprietorship
over to him. Although responsibility remains with the 1968-
1969 editor until June, we yield to tradition; The Ring-tum

Phi is his.

Editors often being reluctant to give up such a post, this
Editor will continue to use the editorial columns, as will the
Editor-Elect, but we leave the rest of the paper (including
all the work) in very capable hands.

 

The Ring-tum Phi Awards

Tomorrow evening at the Senior Banquet the third annual
presentation of The Ring-tum Phi Awards will take place.
These Awards, which will be made to four outstanding gentle-
men, are intended to complement—not compete with—other
forms of recognition for outstanding service to the University.
Particular attention is paid to those who have excelled in some
area, and to those who might otherwise not be honored. The
Awards are sponsored by The Publications Board, and the
recipients are chosen by the Tuesday and Friday editions.

With the Awards go our gratitude and thanks and that
of the entire University community.

 

Regrets; and apologies to
Tom Mitchell and Jim Wilson

Below is reprinted a letter delivered to both editions of
the paper; it appeared last Friday, but we would like to reprint
it—because it deserves acknowledgement, and beacuse we

would like to comment on it:

As co-captains of the W&L base-
ball team, we finally feel compelled
to speak out publicly about the lack
of coverage of our sport by both
editions of the Ring-tum Phi. We feel
that it is the responsibility of the
school paper (a University sponsored
organization) to keep the student body
and faculty informed about other Uni-
versity sponsored organizations of
which the baseball team is most
certainly one.

For a variety of unrelated reasons
including experimentation with print-
ing techniques, fits of temper, and
just poor news gathering, coverage of
sporting events in particular has suf-
fered this year. On Tuesday, April
29, we defeated Lynchburg 11-0. No
mention of this victory was made in
the following Friday's paper. On
Friday, May 2, we split a double-
header with Bridgewater losing the
first game 2-1, but rebounding to take
the second 13-5, The Tuesday edition
of May 6 carried no sports at all
prefering to run a full page ad that

Thom Mitchell

was 80% blank space on what is
usually the sports page.

When the season began, we asked
the staffs of both editions for their
full co-operation and made schedules
and player information available to
them. We were promised assistance
in trying to increase student and fac-
ulty interest in attending our games.
Very little of this help has been forth-
coming. This is most disappointing in
that we feel that we have done our
part to bring recognition to Washing-
ton and Lee this season. The nine
victories we have amassed to date
represent the most wins by a W&L
baseball team since 1952. This fact
plus our overall improvement in the
last two years has prompted the daily
papers in Roanoke, Richmond, and
Lynchburg to ask that we send them
the results of every game. Television
stations in Richmond and Roanoke
have made similar requests. This
demonstrated interest of neighboring
mass media makes us wonder why
the Ring-tum Phi, our school paper,
considers us to be so unimportant.

Jim Wilson

1969 Baseball Co-Captains

To Messrs. Mitchell and Wilson and to the Baseball Team
we extend our sincerest apologies. Excuses? Yes, we have some,
but instead of giving them—which will make it seem as though
we are trying to pass the buck, and we're definitely not—we
will speak for this edition and for the Friday edition as well,

in saying we're sorry.

The editorship of The Ring-tum Phi has not been charact-
erized as a vehicle which makes friends for the Editor (how
true!), but we do not wish to add these gentlemen to our
list of non-admirers. Although it is a little late, we will do our
best to correct an error that should not have been.

 

We agree; and furthermore —*

Last Friday’s edition carried an editorial calling for the
refurbishing, if not the revamping, of the dormitories, especi-
ally with regard to the recent rulings by the faculty permitting
girls to visit men in dormitory rooms.

We heartily add our voice to the sentiments of Mr. Kessler,
perhaps the fact that non-students will become as familiar
with the rooms as we students have—and will likely feel as
we do about them—will prompt some funds to be allocated
for this purpose during the summer. The suggestions Mr.
Kessler made certainly could not be prohibitively expensive.

But we cannot resist the opportunity to put in an even
stronger and more deeply felt word in favor of erecting dormi-
tories, and not just for freshmen but for everyone. This is
not the first time we've suggested this, and hopefully more

support will grow for this long-standing need, a need which |
deserves placement in a higher echelon of priorities than it)

seems to be in now.

Letters
To the Editor

Walker scores
uncooperative Co-op

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Tonight, once again, | was forced
to notice the service given patrons
of the snack bar at the Co-op. This
evening, thirteen students stood by
waiting while one man helped us,
he in no great haste. After being
served I noticed the other three
gentlemen who are employed by the
University to operate this service in
a room behind the bar playing cards.
This is not the first time I have
noticed this type of laxness.

I feel, and I am sure I express the
feelings of many of the students who
patronize the Co-op, that this incom-
petence should not be allowed to
continue. Action should be taken to
relieve this situation, for it is cer-
tainly avoidable and certainly unde-
sirable.

Barbs and Bristles ...

The fools about the hill...

By JEFFREY WEXLER
Columnist

UPTIGHT. THATS HH. UP-
TIGHT. No one blow your cool.
We all Paxton Quigley, man. Re-
member him? He was the fourth in
the attic.

To quote a Dance Board mem-
ber, “He'd be on the Dance Board.
He’s a stud.” Yessir, Paxton Quigleys.
That’s our image—in Playboy and
Esquire for example, and in the dark
night of each and every one of our
souls that’s what we try to be.

“Hold it,” some low-keyed, Gant-
clad, Weejun taped, sockless aspirant
to social valhalla cries. “Hold it,” he
drawls without once letting the merest
hint of saliva dribble down his peach-
fuzzed chin. “What's wrong,” says he,
“with having scored fifty times be-
fore you're a sophomore and not
have acne?”

“Nothing” says I (not owning Wee-
juns or Gant or peach-fuzz). “But,”
I add, with certain self-righteousness,
“it's not everything except for one

thing: This raising of apathy and
‘moves’ to high virtue at expense of
any involvement damns you, and
opens a mortal wound in our aca-
demic society.” (“‘Tis not as wide
as a church door, nor as deep as
a well, but ‘twill do,’ ‘twill do.”)

In a classless age where money
makes the man and men make only
money, there is no such thing as
the gentleman C. Adequacy is in-
adequate. The qualities of a gentle-
man are to be praised—but only as
a means to an ends, Your laurels for
coolness under fire, Paxton Q., are
good only for one thing: Pickling.

But you boys who would grow up
to coolness, you limit your sphere of
action for fear of the uncool. You
limit your individuality for fear of
perverting totally the recipe for stud.
The most involuntary actions become
considered in terms of image. In
short, you become a tin phoney. Up-
tight you are and you take your-
selves too seriously. How much is

 

a pedigree worth?

 

A coming crisis in the Greek system?

DAVID HIGGINS
Columnist

There will always be the need for
something like the fraternity system
in a social environment. Despite the
self-sufficient implications of tech-
nology, man is still a social animal
and as such strives for the recogni-
tion of the group. Fraternities offer
this group-recognition and perhaps
more; but there will be in the future
on this campus a severe crisis for the
Greek system.

The problem will arise because of
two external forces which will occur
simultaneously, the one weakening
the fraternity appeal, the other over-
shadowing the system in its weak-
ened state. Fraternities are rapidly
outliving their own traditions. They
are finding even within their own
ranks that their mystical aura is be-
coming non-existent and that their
idealistic goals are highly suspect.
These selling points of the past are
becoming unimpressive and conse-
quently inefficient. The real selling
point, group-recognition, is still there,
but in a highly pressured society, men
are inclined to feel that they are alone
and must make it on their own, The
recognition of a group which is non-
academic and non-economic is fore-
ed to look superfluous.

This stripping away of a tradition
will reduce the fraternity to a state
analogous to that of a business. The
market products will become room,
board, and party facilities, but there
will be a monopoly arising in the
market which will overshadow the
business-like fraternity. The school
being the larger, more efficient pro-
ducer of these market products will
be the most prosperous and success-
ful in winning the students’ patronage.
Without intentionally going into com-
petition with the fraternity system, the
school will inadvertently cause the
collapse of the fraternity.

The tragedy will not be that the
fraternity system is gone, but that
the overshadowing force will find it
has unconsciously destroyed a very
human institution. In true pendulum
fashion, the old traditions of the fra-
ternity will cease to be questioned.
and as the giant educational complex
becomes more and more efficient at
offering its products to an ever grow-
ing monopolized market, imperson-
alization will result, The instinet for
group-recognition will be acutely felt
now that the highly pressurized so-
ciety has become too efficient and
too concerned with offering these
products so appealing during the ques-
tioning period which destroyed a tra-
dition. Something like the fraternity

By

system will be created by the educa-
tional complex, but a rational insti-
tute will have to deny mysticism and
idealism, aspects which made fra-
ternity recognition so valid in the
past.

Perhaps the academy will find the
answer to the dissatisfaction outside
of fraternity-like institutions, but more
importantly perhaps, the giant should

have been more concerned with what
happened to the “irrelevant and un-
democratic” aspect of its former
existence. In the process of efficiency
the leading force should not neglect
the inefficient and non-academic side
of the social animal. It trends are
really cyclical, there will again be a
role for the fraternity system in the
social environment.

 

Green hills of Virginia

By PAPA

When you have spent some time
shooting in the wetlands of the Isla
de Pinas off the Cuban coast or in
the fields outside Madrid, and when
you have tried your hand at most any
other sport, you will certainly agree,
my friend, that the game of the bull
is most fascinating, and that reeling
in a big hooker with line alone, no
rod, is one of the most satisfying
experiences you will ever know.

It was in the high country of Vir-
ginia that this happened. We were
following the line of the bull that
Spring from one pueblecito to
another. In the evening there were
many fiestas in the apartamientos and
tabernas in the village. In the country
the campesinos celebrated the time
with their sheep.

But this is a sporting story, so I
shall tell you of our adventures. My
driver, tiny man with a quick tongue
and a Bourbon y Parma nose was
named Marty Cohn, a name strange
to this rugged land between Alta-
vista and Buena Vista. He knew of
me not as a writer which I some-
times am, but as an aficionado for
my reputation as a lover of the bull
had proceeded me. Day and night
Marty Cohn swaggered about in a
pair of old rubber fishing boots. He
queried me about what I fished for
once as we sat in the shade of a
redneck in front of the laundro-
materia,

| told him and he was disappoint-
ed. He was not a man for such
types of big game. But he rose this
little hook-nosed Marty Cohn driver
and said he would take me to a clean,
well-lighted place where there would
be much game but after many hours
we stopped only at a Briar Patch.

Marty Cohn said that this was
not his estilo and he would wait in
the war surplus jeep he drove with

hookers had left the patch for other
grounds except for a female who sat
in the shadow of the thorns of the
briars made against my electric light.
I checked my weapon, a single bar-
relled knucherupfer.

In the game of the bull, you will
find that it is the old female ones
who are the hardest to land with a
line alone. This is not a sport for
matadors who are more for the boars.

But as I sat I felt to myself 1
had a hooker. Placing a beer on the
table, I let her have bait. She took
it. | let her have line. She took it.
I let her have play. She took it. You
must understand that when you have
a cold cerveza Ballantine or a malta
Hatvey and you are fishing for a
trophy, you must take care with every
move. You must be cool.

“Papa,” to myself I said, “be cool.”
I am an old man and the sea is a
woman. In Spanish, they hear los-
gringos turistos say “No haga las
olas.” Don't make waves.

But I started to reel her in too
quick. I jerked. She snapped back.
And while she continued to take line,
I knew, my friend, that she was no
hooker, no easy mark. I knew as
even Hefner who was once very good
with lines that [| had lost this game
of bull.

On the way back to our camp some
miles near the Natural Bridge, Marty
Cohn looked at me and said, “You
must not be sad, papa, man is not
made for defeat. Man can be de-
stroyed but not defeated.”

We moved on the next morning
at dawn to chase the camp-followers
on the streets of the little towns.

Library hours
during exams

 

Garland Tucker, chairman of the
Student Library Committee, announc-
ed that beginning on May 19 the
library will be open until 3 a.m, in
the morning to facilitate exam study-
ing. The extension of library hours
during exam week was begun last
semester. Mr. Leach, the head li
brarian, noted that attendance at the
library was high until 2 a.m. after
which there seemed to be hardly
enough people studying there to keep
it open. Mr, Leach said, that after
consultation with the Student Library
Committee, it would be again kept
open until 3 am. but if the at-
tendance was again low between 2
am, and 3 am, it would only be
kept open until 2 a.m. in the future

Mr. Leach also announced a stiffer
policy toward returning books at the
end of the year. All books are due
by June §. Those books not returned
iby June 9 will be subject to a $3
lservice fine: if the books are lost
they will have to be paid for by
the loser. There will be a box in
front of the library from June § to
June 9 to facilitate those who wish to
return their books while the library
is closed

Is it worth the great gobs of
silvercoins and dollar bills paid for
campaign posters? The down-the-road
gas money. The churning feeling of
not dressing right or of being called
a (excuse the language) flamer? Of
course, it’s worth it. You believe
being a stud lasts. Since there are
no responsibilities for doing, there is
no lasting recognition in this world
if you're a stud (or is there a Hall
of Fame for Breeders, Cherry-Pickers,
Bare-back Riders, and Caretakers?).
“As all life is passion and action, man
must be a part of the action and
passion of his time upon pain of be-
ing judged not to have lived at all.”
No stud Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote
that. Maybe he’s wrong. We all re-
member Don Juan—translated into
Don Giovanni—who went to Hell.
Or, as Dante said, “The hottest place
in Hell is reserved for those who in
times of moral crisis have reserved
their commitment.” In this time a
stud cannot afford involvement or
commitment; he must be agile, not
fumble; he must leave all exits open.
“Here I stand and it is not safe to
move,” he cries,

I dare suggest we have past the
Reformation and in this time a
normal, unstudly man affraid less of
temporal flames than eternal fire
knows that it is not safe to stay put.

Little men in grey flannel levis
with little grip-fisted stomachs out in
the rain, afraid to go inside, but
afraid too to enjoy the downpour.
We take ourselves to seriously. We
want to grow up too fast. So we
lose perspective. We cease to treat
things as they are but use the concept
of microcosm. The institutions of
Washington and Lee cease to be part
of the world but instead become
parallels to it. We are no longer a
part of the mountain but a_ hillock
unto ourselves, Thus the concept of
microcosm.

And once you have made your
stand here, there are no more stands
to make. Once your success is ac-
knowledged here, you are a success
for all time. Remember Irwin Shaw's
“The Eighty Yard Run”? That's it.
So you push and you shove out of
perspective, concerning yourself not
with your own appreciation of these
shortest, gladdest years, but with
others’ appreciation of your place in
it. Damn the opposition. (Or, as the
Hon. Whipple says, “Let them eat
glass.”) Dare to be eccentric. Letting
go is so fine. Grow mature but don’t
grow up.

Do your own thing. Be eccentric
enough to establish values for your-
self and, for God's (and your own)
sake don't be duped into the simple
expedient of accepting the crutch of
“studliness” from one of the fair-
haired sun-tanned damned Lotharios
and image worshipers of WAL. Over-
use of crutches leads to atrophy of
limbs... all limbs.

Washington and Lee’s representa-
tives at the spring CAC tournament
overcame a 20 point deficit to win
the CAC bell for the overall con-
ference championship. It was the
second straight year that the Gen-
erals had earned such an_ honor.
Leading the way was the tennis
team which gained its third straight
conference title under the leadership
of Coach Verne Canfield. W&L’s track
men took the second spot in con-
ference competition and the base-
ball team and golfers each placed
third.

The tennis team entered the tourney
with a 6-5 record against tough major
college competition. In Friday’s
matches the Generals placed four
singles and three doubles teams in
the finals. But it was on Saturday
that the finals and the ultimate test
came. Tommy Rueger (no. 1) won
his matches 4-6, 6-2 and 6-2. Bill
Gatlin (no. 3) won by the scores
5-7, 6-1, 6-3. And Rick Armstrong
(no. 5) beat his opponent 1-6, 6-3,
6-4. John Kefauver also placed in
the sixth place slot.

Rain almost ended the finals in
doubles, but after some heated dis-
putes W&L’s doubles teams assured
a first place berth to the Generals.
Coach Canfield attributed the all im-
portant first place win to the doubles
teams of Rueger-Gatlin, Armstrong-
Driscoll, and MecClure-McJunkin,
who were out playing until 8:00
Saturday evening.

A second place finish came to
;Coach Walden’s tracksters. Friday
|saw the Generals capture first place
in two out of four events. Mike
Neer won the high jump with a
leap of 6-6, within %4 of an inch
of his own conference record, W&L
also took the javelin event with a
clean sweep of first, second, and third
places. Mike Carrere won with a toss
of 171-7 and behind him were Charlie

Freret and Neer.
Saturday brought two more vic-
tories for Washington and Lee. A

time of 54.3 was good enough for
Sam Hinkle to take the 440. Strong-
man Doug Deaton jumped to the lead
in the discus by flinging for a distance
of 138-7. Washington College of St.
Louis, however used its strength in
the running events to edge out W&L
for the conference _championship.

A total of 634 points put the golf
team in sole possession of third place
in the CAC tournament. After bat-
tling on the greens all day Friday
the Generals were only in fourth
place. But fine play on Saturday en-
abled Washington and Lee’s golfers to
advance to third in the final standings,
behind Sewanee and Centre. The out-

standing performer turned out to be
Dick Singletary who placed fourth
individually with a total of 153
