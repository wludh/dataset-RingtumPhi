Dean Atwood, in reporting the
SAC’s recommendations to the fac- |

 

 

ington Literary Society at Washing-
ton and Lee during his senior year
as the student who had contributed
most to the University.

He will succeed Dr. Edward C.
Atwood Jr., who has been the Uni-
versity’s Dean of Students since 1962.
Dr. Atwood was designated last week
to succeed the retiring Dr. Lewis W.
Adams as Dean of the School of
Commerce and Administration.

After receiving his B.A. degree at
Washington and Lee, John studied
political economy for a year at the
University of Edinburgh in Scotland
on a Fulbright Scholarship

He joined Washington and Lee's
administrative staff in 1963 As
sistant Dean of Students and Director
of Student Financial Aid. He was also

as

an instructor in economics,

Last August, John returned to
Washington and Lee to assume his
current position. He has served as

chairman of the university’s student

financial aid committee and as a
member of the admissions and stu-
dent affairs committees.

Dean Frank J. Gilliam, the first
Dean of Students, served in that
position from its creation in 1931

until his retirement in February of
1962. He also served concurrently as
the first Dean of Admissions. Mr
Gilliam joined the faculty in 1926
at a post in the English Department.
As Dean of Students, he instituted
many programs. He is the “founding
father” of Freshman Camp. It was he
who established the faculty advisor
program and the current policy of
requiring freshmen to live in the
dorms. He was also a strong sup
porter of fraternity-college relations

Upon Dean Gilliam’s retirement in
1962, Dr. Edward C. Atwood was

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

DEAN ATWOOD MOVES UP —

A FEW REASONS WHY REGRET
WOULD NOT BE

AN INAPPROPRIATE EMOTION

This is an editorial bordering on the type a college editor
generallly rejects—people have been walking into this office
suggesting comendatons for everyone; students, faculty, and
administrators. Yet propriety deems that a student choose
very carefully which of his elders he will discuss in these
columns. And after writing that, all trepidation has been
catharsized . . .

For seven years Professor E. C. Atwood, Jr. has served
as Dean of Students. We have known him for but three of
those years, and in that time his image has been—as are the
images of most Deans of students—a vascillating one. “Dean
Atwood’s a (good) (bad) guy.’ Choose one.

But the choice has too often depended on the circumstances
at hand—few of us stop to remember that Dean Atwood is
just that: Dean Atwood. And he has performed his duties as
Dean much to our liking.

All most of us see of him is 1) when we’re in trouble,
or 2) at an IFC meeting (where rumormongering is at its
height). As for 1), do we want a Dean who will say, ‘Well,
you blew up the New Dorm last night, but I’m sure it’s
due to questions of your environment, and we all make
mistakes .. .”’? No! We want—or at least this editor wants—
a Dean who will be fair but firm, as Dean Atwood has been.

In regard to 2), the IFC is not a body to which the Dean
should speak in tones of social grace about the many redeem-
ing qualities of fraternities—he should be the faculty’s ad-
vocate, which he is. And, just ask any professor; in a faculty
meeting he is the students’ advocate.

In our humble opinion, Professor Atwood has performed
his duties as Dean of Students in a competent fashion, and
at the same time has maintained the students’ interests at
heart. We wish him well in his new post.

THE LAST OF TWO EC COMMENDATIONS
A WORD OF APPRECIATION TO

PETE HENDRICKS

AND

DANNY LEONARD

Two weeks ago this edition recognized publicly what
many had realized all year, that the President of the Student
Body had led the Executive Committee dutifully and more
than capably in his term and deserved a special word of
thanks.

There are two others on the EC who should be com-
mended, not only for taking their task as seriously as it
should have been taken, but for adding an inexplicable extra
something to the meetings—call it what you will: decorum,
style, a will to serve. These are men who will not be serving
next year; one because he will be working in Atlanta, the
other for personal reasons. Next year’s editors may or not
wish to laud such outstanding men as Joe Tompkins but we
shall confine our comments to non-returning men.

The first of these is Pete Hendricks, Senior / Intermediate
representative from the Law School. The second is Danny
Leonard, junior representative.

We would like to say glorious, memorable things about
Pete and Danny, but we won’t because we don’t think they
want to hear them now. Perhaps it would suffice to say they
tired to be impartial about the EC this year—we have attended
nearly every meeting, with the intention first of reporting
and (peripherally) of observing the men themselves. We
will not delude you, or ourself, by proclaiming the virtues
of these gentlemen’s opinions, for in all cases we have not
agreed with them.

But what's important is that Pete and Danny have acted
on their best judgment, which, as it turns out, is judgment
articulated only after careful consideration, What more can
we, as students, ask of our leaders? Not much. And yet
these qualities of temperance and debate with oneself are all
too rare among EC members.

Many times this year it has occurred to us that every
W&L student should attend at least one EC meeting; the
meetings are not what one mght suspect. Yet throughout,
Pete and Danny have conducted themselves and their affairs
in a manner which does justice to their high positions.

To paraphrase the words of a recent Friday edition edi-
torial, we are not castigating anyone; we are trying to be
positive. Omissions? Sure, Only one or so of the 12-man com-
mittee was a recognizably poor member, and so we have chosen
those whom we deem, as influential or non-influential a deemer

as we are, to be the better of the good.

AND YET ANOTHER COMMENDATION,
THE DEBATE TEAM AND MR. CHAFFIN

While we're on the subject of commendations, it would
only be fair to mention Mr. Chaffin's debate team, This
would be a news story and not an editorial if we were to re-
capitulate the 23 trophies and certificates won in 23 tourna-
ments or to re-tell the virtues of the John Reynolds-Tim
Wright team—but it should be pointed out, nevertheless, that
what was described in late May of last year as a “rebuilding
year” has turned out to be a phenomenon on the order of
pre-fab construction.

The team usually wins only limited coverage by the news-
paper (even though Mr. Chaffin _ by the office with a
story almost every Monday night), and the trophies are quietly
dsplayed in the foyer of Payne Hall.

And as is the case with all teams, the coach deserves most

of the credit.

This Review
Written In The Hand Of
A Man Who Enjoyed The

Book

By JEFFREY WEXLER
Columnist

Not ever having had a book pub-
lished, nor yet again ever having
enrolled in one of Dr. Ollinger J.
Crenshaw’s courses, I was chosen by
my editor as thus being uniquely
qualified to review “General Lee’s
College.”

The work is particularly beautiful,
being the product of research cover-
ing more years than I have been
alive. It is a book that leaves the
reader, especially the friend of Wash-
ington and Lee, with mixed feelings.
There are satisfactions and there are
regrets.

The process of the work is from
our mystery-enshrouded beginnings in
1749 to 1930 with a minute epilogue
bringing one to less ancient times of
the 1960's, This, to me, was most
lamentable. | should have appreciat-
ed an account of the last third of a
century in depth, precision, and wit
equal to that of the previous 181
years. This omission was, of course,
not an oversight on the part of Dr.
Crenshaw, Many many of the people
as intimate to the events of the years
of Presidents Gaines and Cole and
Huntley as is Dr. Crenshaw are still
involved with the present and have
hopes for the future. To set down
their histories, a senior gentleman of
the faculty informed me, Dr. Cren-
shaw felt, would lead to problems
avoidable by committing the sin of
omission, One hopes, however, that
these chapters omitted exist in manu-
script form and will be published
eventually in a revised edition. Such
chapters would be invaluable primary
source data,

This same faculty gentleman has
characterized Professor Crenshaw’s
prose as one of a “scholarly nature”
and a “graceful wit.” With certain
humility, | concur. “General Lee's
College” is good reading. It reads as
Cassius Clay (the present one) fights:
“float like a butterfly, sting like a
bee.” The progress of the book is
never bogged in turgid prose and
viscous statistics. The biographical
sketches are sharp and revealing. One
cites the passages on Louis Marshall—
to remind the reader of this review
that the admonition “Plus ca change.
. . .” applies to education and to
Washington and Lee as well, One cites
the passages on Louis Marshall as
illustration of Dr. Crenshaw’s talent.

The story mounts as an execution
well-laid out: “Classes were abolished
save for voluntary association by two
or more pupils, and even then in-
structional sessions lasted only as long
as the students wished.” Dr, Marshall
attempted to be “one of the boys,”
we are told, “meeting them on their
own terms.” And then comes William
H. Ruffner's obiter dictum of Mar-
shall; “As likely as not,” Dr. Cren-
shaw quotes Ruffner as saying, “the
visitor would find him during recita-
tion lolling in his bed [in his class-
room|, pipe in mouth . . . the to-
bacco smoke rivalling in density a
London fog.” Then Professor Cren-
shaw spring his trap: “Soon afterward
{Dr. Marshall] left for Kentucky,
never to return, without bothering to
resign or explain.” Such is Dr. Cren-
shaw’s style.

Of course, the chapters concerning
General Lee are of primary interest.
On a shopping spree at Christmas 1
foolishly invested a 59-cent portion
of my patrimony in a bargain table
copy of Marshall W. Fishwick's “Lee
After the War” (which, according to
Virginia Kirkus, “fills an empty
space.”) I rely too on Douglas South-
all Freeman's magnificent “R. E. Lee,”
published some years before Dr.
Fishwick’s work, which, at least by
Miss Kirkus’ standards did not fill the
“empty space” well enough. There are
numerous ways to look at a topic.
While Dr. Freeman viewed our col-
lege from the standpoint of Lee, Dr.
Crenshaw views Lee from the stand-
point of our college, To one, Wash-
ingion College was an aspect, albeit
an important one, in the life of a
great hero. To the other, Lee was an
wspect, possibly the most important
one, in the life of a great college.
Hoth views have merit in the absence
of duplication and in the wealth of
primary data, Dr. Fishwick, who
spent a decade some years ago, teach-
ing everything at Washington and
Lee, admonishes us, “Do not ex-
pect to find in this litthe book much

 

that Douglas Southall Freeman has

He's right. Nevertheless, one remains

 

faithful that “this little book” fills
an empty space on someone’s book-
shelf somewhere . . . adequately but
not well. There are only two chapters
on General Lee in “General Lee’s
College, but they are the pivot. Stu-
dents and scholars (a redundancy at
this school of course) can delight in
them. There is the story of the
Union army veteran E. C. Johnston
coming to Lexington to establish
Negro schools as an agent of the
American missionary association and
his letter condemning Washington
College as such missive appeared in
the press. Dr. Crenshaw, recounting
the tale in measured word, con-
cludes, “A crowd of students gathered
about [Johnston] and insulted him.
He appealed for military protection,
but General Lee, Judge Brocken-
brough, Mayor Ruff, and John
Letcher persuaded federal authorities
not to send troops. Never had he
lived in such a town where drunken
students roamed the streets at night,
firing pistols and uttering threats.”
(“Plus ca change .. .” encore?) Then
Professor Crenshaw springs the trap
—again. He quotes a United States
Army officer stationed in Lynchburg
at the time and intimate with the
details of the case: “The officer de-
fended General Lee, who had acted
vigorously, and charged that Johns-
ton had drawn a pistol on a twelve-
year-old boy.”

I cannot recommend “General Lee’s
College.” My dubious qualifications as
a reviewer of the book do not in-
clude that prerogative. However, I
intend to buy a second copy and a
third copy and would encourage you
(you-all?) to do the same. “General
Lee’s College” does the old man
honor,

HIGH POLITICS ON
CAMPUS.

What A Great Story
This Is.

By A. WOOLLCOTT, IR,
Writer

POSTED NOTES FROM ALL
OVER, or, Spring is Sprung and So
Are the Politicians.

I was on campus recently (which
should surprise some of my profes-
sors) and spent several minutes stroll-
ing about, viewing with alarm, “The
Hill,” as Washington and Lee stu-
dents call it, is never more beautiful
than in the Springtime (1 have been
told), and one can well believe it.
For successive weeks at this time,
WAL becomes a school of well-dress-
ed lemmings, almost all of them
running for office.

An invitation arrived at the city
desk of the R-t P to join the cam-
paign trains of several of the half
million candidates running. Sequest-
ering a hat in the ringful 1 proceeded
to seek out several of the more bless-
ed to listen to the thunder of their
cannonizations,

Now, speaking of oratorical bomb-
blasts, my Irish mother’s Gaelic father
was a man of wise advice. He was
a bigot, however, and in light of the
current proceedings in Lexington,
City of Man, one is hesitant at quot-
ing the old Mick, Without rational
reason, he was consistently against
Englishmen regardless of religion or
politics.

With this fault of character (as
some will consider it, they being
English, which is not their fault, or
Anglophiles, which is a mark of pro-
nounced mental disability), under-
stood, One can accept my grandpa’s
prediliction for infernal machines,
things that go boom in the night.
He was very fond of direct action,
explaining when the tide of John
Jameson (a far better mocker than
Lord Blarney) ran high in his blood,
“Keep you mouth shut, boys, ‘ceptin
as when you've a glass in yer hand.”

This being integral to the establish-
ment of any alcoholic’s career, the
flow of words and juice being com-
plementary, | went, credo in hand,
to visit firstly the headquarters of
candidates in the immediate neighbor-
hood. Thus it was that I took the
Reid Hall elevator to the plush pent-
house offices of Larry Honig, Editor
of this Journal, The guard, sten gun
in hand, mistook me for Howard
Hughes (who consults fellow-Texan
Honig frequently fellow-Texan Honig
later informed me). He let me pass.
There, behind an orange crate that
Editor Honig had fashioned from a
Louis Quatorze mahogany escritoire,
sat The Man himself, surrounded by
cases of RC’s and moon pies. Behind
him stood R, Machiavelli Byrum. his
political counsel. Col, Byrum, Dr,
Honig informed me, offering me a
shot of pure white lightning in a
cut glass Dixie cup, is a candidate
for the office of Vice President of the
School of Arts and Sciences, Class
of 1970, Profewor Honig, Candidate
Byrum added, has indeed allowed his
name to be presented to the grubby
sweaty in the EC elections for the

omitted from his four huge volumes.” | same Class of 1970, “Tends to be,”

appended the Great Man himself,

 

fingering his red, white, and blue
galluses. “Mr. Hughes, your multi-
millionaireship,” began Col. Byrum,
noted connoissuer of horse and wo-
men flesh. I corrected this mistake
and perceiving a sudden chill and the
presence of the same stormtrooper
who'd greeted me at the elevator, I
beat a hasty retreat,

Jeb Brown not running for office,
I decided to visit his successor in
the Theatre of Political Melodrama,
John Richard, No, I take that back
(as a former handball champion of
Rockbridge County might say, “strike
that.”). Comparing Jeb Brown to
John Richard is like comparing Aida
to the H.M.S. Pinafore. I was greeted
at the gate to his fabulous campaign
palace by a giant Nubian wearing the
Hapsburg colors. I noticed a Union
Jack flying over the castle( an edifice
bearing startling resemblence to the
Lime Kiln) and, with a sense of
prejudice similar to my grandfather's,
I, refusing to associate myself with
oppressive minority groups and Ang-
lophiliacs, turned and left.

Discovering the other candidates all
to be fictitious and non-existant ex-
cept as seen through the rosy paper
on their posters, | returned to the
blessed security of my desk in the

And Here’s Another
FANTASTIC STORY
About Campus Politicians.

By LAURENCE M. HILLIARD
Columnist

Class elections have come and
gone for another year, and unless
you happen to be a freshman, you
must have had the feeling that you
were reviewing a summer repeat. Ex-
cept for some of the names, every-
thing was the same as last year, and
the year before, and the year before
that, probably back to 1749. The
ruins of Liberty Hall, back during
their more functioning days, were un-
doubtedly liberally covered with
multi-colored campaign flyers.

Campaign 1969 had the same cam-
paign posters as untold elections be-
fore, with their brag sheets (varsity
leap frog, palm readers club, SDS,
YAF) and their same stale campaign
slogans (Progressive, Responsible,
Leadership”). And every candidate
promises the same things (liberaliza-
tion of dormitory regulations, an in-
dependent exam schedule, etec.).

After a year at W&L, you would
think the freshman should realize that
the positions of class president and
vice-president are, nothing but social
positions—after Openings Weekend,
the sophomore president might as
well go into hibernation, One candi-
date campaigned for Sophomore Class
President with flyers that proclaimed
that he is:

For Liberalized distribution require-

ments

For a coed exchange program

For more liberal dorm and fra-

ternity regulations concerning
girls

For a W&L popular movie program
Another candidate for the same office
had a six-point program that includ-
ed points that were equally as dis-
tant from the office of a class presi-
dent. Students campaigning for class
president on such platforms are about
as ridiculous as Louis Nunn com-
paigning for governor of Kentucky on
the platform that the Johnson Ad-
ministration was mishandling the war
in Vietnam. The fact that Nunn was
elected and the two freshmen were
defeated probably shows that the
WAL freshman is more politically
astute that the Kentucky hillbilly,
which might or might not be a
worthwhile distinction,

The results of the class elections
were just about as expected. All the
STUDS were elected. Incumbents had
no trouble getting re-elected. Honig
continued to make a reputation as
the William Jennings Bryan of WAL.

| have voted in my election at
WAL, a fact that hardly saddens me.
if | had it all to do over again
(heaven forbid!), | would vote for
the candidates who said the least,
put up the fewest posters, and most
especially, for any candidate who
said or did anything original,

duPont Art Exhibit
Receives These
RAVE REVIEWS.
Students At W&L Have
Been Performing

Wonderfully.

ty KIRK WOODWARD
Critic

This years WAL Student Art Ex-
hibit has taken up residence in du-
Pont Hall's main corridor (mistakenly
called an art gallery), and will re-
main there through May 30. The
show is a good one, well worth
seeing

A common theme unites the ex-
hibit, demonstrated in pieces like Carr
Garnett's “Vepco,” which shows the

 

telephone and power wires outside
the W&L art studio window, and in
pieces of sculpture made entirely of
automobile pistons, nails, and weld-
ed bumpers. The common theme is
that of the specific object, especially
the machine or the art work. This
theme makes itself known in some
ingenious ways.

Some art works literally make ob-
jects their subject: Mark Faverman’s
“Eleanor” is a painting behind a
battered old window-frame. Some
present the operation of objects:
Larry Mann has assembled two
heavy iron wheels in a construction
called “Gatling II” which has moving
parts and makes a wonderful low
rumbling noise when rolled. Others
make comments on _ objects: the
“African Mask” painted by James
Maloney is surounded by a yellow-
orange backgound suggesting fire and
heat; the fire also peeps through the
mask’s eyes. Some are works making
comments on their own material.
Robert Trotman has done a painting
in which the crucified Christ’s torso
seems to be really suspended in space,
a feat accomplished through skillful
use of color.

The dominant painting style of the
exhibit also effects close attention to
colors with little or no shading; back-
grounds are simple areas of pastels
with no details. Presented in this way,
machines like Robert Martin’s loco-
motive “Toy” acquire a new import-
ance; they seem to be a whole world
in themselves.

The exhibit has no essays on the
Vietnam War and only one, a piece
of sculpture, on love. The reason for
these ommisions is significant and
points to the basis of the exhibit’s
success, Student art tends to be im-
passioned, generalized, and vague, so
a teacher who directs a student's at-
tention to technique and to the speci-
fic performs a service. As proof, the
material in this exhibit which depends
on feeling—the social consciousness
work—is compositionally flabby for
the most part. (An exception is Mot
Wright's “Summertime,” a painting of
a helmeted policeman and the atmo-
sphere surrounding him.)

But when the artists pay attention
to specifics, the benefits flow. The
artists represented in this exhibit are
able to utilize a wide range of tech-
nical resources. Robert Lytle, for ex-
ample, draws on the paintings of
centuries ago; and the surface of
Peter Zimmermann’s “Earth Con-
tours” looks and feels like its subject.
The exhibit can also be funny. Carr
Garnett has a dramatic painting of
a stoplight, called, appropriately,
“Spotlight.” Larry Mann has made
an excellent chess set (called “Chess
Set") on which Mr. Dave Hall was
recently seen winning a game.

The exhibit is a sign that some-
body is doing his job well. “Some-
body” is Mr, Prohaska, whose exhibit
of Mediterranean impressions some
months ago was a landmark, and Mr.
Hall, and the artists who worked and
contributed. But next year the two
teachers will be gone. No one can
feel too comfortabie.

I have saved the best for last.
A star of the show is, of all things,
a realistic picture, L. C. Quin’s “Jul-
ians Hill,” which looks menacing.
Peter Zimmermann’s lovely “Wraith”
and Mot Wright's “Agonda” are also
stars. These three paintings have been
sold or claimed. On the other hand,
Robert Lytle’s cleanly abstract “Las
Mujeres” and James Maloney’'s
“Samurai” are still for sale. So are
two fascinating works, Christopher
Meyer's sculpture “The Clothes His
Maid Wore,” which incidentally has
the best title in the exhibit, and Henry
L. Hill's “1983 The Future Ap-
proaches,” which incidentally has the
worst title, These four are all more
than worth their price. Some others,
too.
