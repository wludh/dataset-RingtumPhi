‘The way

I see it’

(Editor's note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
facutly concerning any topic.)

By FRAN LAWRENCE

The most difficult position for the
student to assume, and yet probably
the most beneficial, is that of non-
involvement. By non-involvement I
mean non-commitment to organiza-
tions and organized beliefs which de-
mand judgments on the way things
ought to be in the world or the na-
tion. Such involvements are purported
to be necessary to bring about a
better world, They are directed to-
ward what are proclaimed to be good
and essential ideas. They pretend to
hold the hope for the future. As well,
strong and articulate commitment to
the involvement is supposed to show
strength of character, sensitivity to
the human situation, love for fellow
man, Those involved argue that views
opposed to theirs are at least wrong,
perhaps dangerous, and that those
uncommitted are apathetic, insensi-
tive, or perhaps inhuman.

My contention is that the student
should make a point of non-commit-
ment because of the circumstances
uniquely belonging to him and only
available to him for four short years.
Academic freedom can only be realiz-
ed in the individual student that frees
himself from preconception about the
way things are or ought to be.
Literally, it is being able to be free
in order to learn,

Admittedly, the student will pick
up ideas (for instance, this idea) but
committing himself to the organiza-
tions of the ideas doubles the prob-
lem. Now the student must quit both
the idea and the organization to move
on. Pressures toward standing be-
hind ideas in college seem to be the
tragic extention of a neurotic fear of

WA&L in finals at
Dartmouth meet

Debaters Tim Wright and John
Reynolds set a new school record
last weekend by being the first WAL
team ever to reach the elimination
rounds at the Dartmouth Invitational
Debate Tournament. Seeded 14th out
of the top 100 teams across the
nation, (including such top teams as
MIT, UCLA, and Houston), the
Wright-Reynolds combination finally
lost to Harvard. Except for George
Washington University and Houston,
who finally won the tournament, W&L
was the only school in the Southeast
to reach the eliminations,

In other competition around the
nation, John MeCardell and Bill
Radigan won three of five debates at
Drexel. In Richmond, Kenny Murov
and Doug Adams were chosen the
fourth and fifth best speakers in the
Novice division, while they with team
mates Stacy Eastland and Charles
Smith won six of twelve debates.
Also this weekend, Kevin Baker and
Andrew Wyndham posted a two-six
record at Northwestern.

 

 

  
  
  
    

Senator George McGovern addresses Contact audience in Lee Chapel.

McGovern attacks U. S. foreign policy
in final address for Contact symposium

Sen. George McGovern, D-SD, said
here Saturday “the true lessons of
history are to be found in a sense
of limits, an appreciation of how
greatness has destroyed itself again
and again by reaching for what it
could never obtain.” His speech, “The
Limitations of Power,” was Contact's
final symposium for 1969.

Before a crowd of more than 600
in Lee Chapel, McGovern pointed to
a need for a re-evaluation of policies.
“No where,” he said, “is there more
need for a re-evaluation than in
foriegn policy.”

McGovern used as an example the
war in Vietnam. “The lesson America
must learn from the Vietnam war is
a sense of its own limitations in
world affairs. The United States has
mistakenly viewed the Vietnam con-
flict as one battleground in a titanic
world struggle between democracy
and communism, between the forces
of good and evil. What we have
lacked, in my judgement, is a sense
of history, a sense of perspective
about ourselves and other nations.
Thus, we are contending in our own
minds not with a proud and sensitive
people humiliated by more than a
century of colonialism, but with
bloodless materialists.”

McGovern went on to say this
“seeming blindness to historical per-
spective goes far beyond Southeast
Asia. American idealism, America’s
sense of itself as the world’s last
and best hope, has lead to a blurring
of the lines. We seem to have lost
the capacity to tell where America
leaves off and the rest of the world
begins. We have been told our cause

Managing Editor

é WAL graduate Charlie McDowell, Jr. class of
1948, syndicated humorist-columnist and Washington ©
correspondent for the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Fe-
cently offered some fresh comments on campus dis-

ordets.

Speaking before a seminar, “News As It Is Or isn't”
at Mary Baldwin last week, MeDowell reflected on
student activism from the journalist's perspective. '

McDowell objectively approached the delicate ques-
tion of the media's connection with student rebellion
ws a causal agent, While not rejecting that the media
(especially television) do act as stimuli, McDowell

_ defended the position of the media on the grounds ©
- that TV and newspapers have the task, which they ©
must accomplish, of presenting the news. He explained
that newsmen try to cover such controversial events

as objectively as possible.

However, in many cases, Newsworthy circumstances,
no matter how objective in their presentation, don't
lend themselves to unbiased interpretation. For example,
McDowell pointed out that often in a confrontation
“officials will behave stupidly, and television will cover 5

-
it.

By capitalizing on such broadcasts student leaders
can “provoke the right people,” and then instead of
20 they have 2,000 people to lead, McDowell added

was the cause of all mankind. We
have not distinguished between stand-
ing for our ideals at home and trying
to impose them on others abroad.”

McGovern said he hoped the
United States will “exercise prudence
and cautiousness” in its foreign policy.
“We must beware of intervening in
other peoples internal strife.” If it
becomes necessary, then “let’s take
the request to the U.N.”

When asked about the possibilities

of a volunteer army, McGovern re-

“I favor this system over the
draft.” The problem of the draft
system is that “those men are lost
about the time they become valu-
able.” The volunteer system would
sign men on a 20-30 year career basis,
thus eliminating the problem of turn-
over and the wasted cost of training
men who will be released in two
or three years. The volunteer system
would eliminate most of the unfair-
ness of the present sysiem that
“hangs the threat of the draft over
the heads of all young men when
only a few are called.”

The proposed system would neces-
sitate doubling service pay of en-
listed men making it comparable to
civilian pay scales. “One of the prob-
lems is that we don't have a definitive
study of the proposal yet. However
the President has asked that this be
expedited. With the war hopefully
drawing to a close, now seems to be
a good time to look at a change.”

Asked whether the volunteer sys-
tem would create a class army, Me-
Govern pointed out that “we have
a large career force as far as officers.”

News analysis

By PROF, DELOS D. HUGHES
Political Science

Campus discussion about this year’s
Contact Symposium is as often about
the merits of Contact as a program
as it is about the ideas Contact
speakers left with their audiences.
After five years experience and sev-
eral thousand dollars expense it seems
appropriate to reconsider the pro-
gram fully and publicly. The opinions
of the whole community are relevant
and needed. These reflections are |
offered in that cause.

There is a widespread assumption
that any serious activity initiated by
students—even if radical—is valuable
because it is evidence of the growth
of what a university exists to nour-
ish. This assumption often leads us to
be uncritical about such activity. Even
when speakers are poor, the audience
insensitive or unresponsive, and lec-
tures poorly attended, approval of a
Coniact program is almost automatic
—not because anyone necessarily got
something out of it, but because a
number of people put a great deal
into it.

If this point has merit, some ques-
tions ought to occur, Was anything
gained from Contact other than ad-
ministrative experience for its man-
agers? Is the quality of the Sym-
posium experience a result of the
structure of the program, the talents
of the guests, or the competence of
the audience? Is the benefit worth the
expenditure? Is there an alternative,
more efficicient way to use resources
to the same or greater advantage?

The suggestion in raising these
questions is not that the IFC and
commitiees have answered

ous to the public whether such mat-

EC plans freshman

assimilation program

An unusually uneventful Executive
Committee meeting discussed Mock
Convention debts for last year, As-
similation Committee proposals, and
Staman Ogilvie’s exam scheduling
proposal.

First on last evening’s agenda was
the discussion of uncollected bills of
the Mock Convention. Two students
were questioned about their inability
to gain payment of advertising bills
for the “Journal.” As yet, Frank’s
ESSO, Barn Dinner Theater, and
Churchill Downs have failed to ful-
fill their contracts of last year. Danny
Leonard stated that he will attempt
to get the University to send bills
to these companies, so as to give
more legitimacy and authority to the
requests.

Also concerning the Mock Con-
vention, Ron Kessler stated that at
the present time his organization re-
quired no funds, as debts had been
paid, and no immediate needs for
money existed. He reminded the EC
of the up-coming selection of reg-
ional chairmen and general co-chair-
men for the Convention in 1972.

Bill Gottwald reported upon a pro-
gram formulated by the Assimilation
Committee to aid freshmen in the
selection of their majors. The group
plans to sponsor a meeting this
Spring of freshmen, department heads,
and several upperclassmen to dis-
cuss the various majors. They will
meet in Lee Chapel for three con-
secutive nights, each session devoted
to either the Commerce School, the
College, or to the science and math
departments. President Passavant
noted that the most outstanding
feature of this proposal is that it is
run by students and not faculty; this
will facilitate better understanding by
freshmen of the departments.

The VASG meeting coming up
Thursday, February 20, was discuss-
ed next. Danny Leonard, Joe Tomp-
kins, Rob Turnbull, Rob Bauer, and
Reed Byrum were chosen to repre-
sent W&L at the conference. Passa-
vant then encouraged members of
the Student Civil Liberties Commit-
tee to attend the Hollins Conference
on Student Disorders, which will be
held this weekend.

ODK assembly

The ODK Assembly will begin at
11:50 a.m. on Friday, February 21,
in Doremus Gymnasium. Attendance
is required.

The schedule of classes on Friday
morning will be as follows:

A—8:00-8:40 G—-10:18-10:55

C—B8:45-9:25 1—11:00-11:40

E—9:30-10:10 Assembly —11:50

 

 

Staman Ogilvie then spoke about
his proposed exam schedule. He will
meet tomorrow with the faculty Com-
mittee on Courses and Degrees to
explain his plan in depth to them.
EC members will then be sent to
all faculty members to discuss the
possible scheduling change. The addi-
tion of a reading day was cited as
a further change in the proposal, but
concern was expressed about faculty
sentiment against this. The faculty
Executive Committee stated in its
meeting yesterday afternoon that a
day will be added to the present
number of class days if a reading
day is to be included. The possibility
of the Saturday before Spring vaca-
tion being used as such a day seemed
most favorable to this faculty group.
The EC then voted unanimous sup-
port to Sandler to include a reading
day in the proposed exam plan.

—Reed Byrum

IFC endorses
a reading day

The IFC in its session last night
voted to recommend to the faculty
to retire the Scholarship Cup which
has been held by ZBT for the last
14 semesters. They also endorsed an
EC resolution requesting a reading day
for the Thursday before exams start.

The resolution urging the retirement
of the cup was introduced by Chuck
Cahn and passed by a narrow 8-7
margin. Mark Eaker’s resolution sup-
porting last week’s EC action on a
reading day for this spring passed
unanimously.

Dean Atwood mentioned that there
are three alternatives involved in
eliminating the reading day. First,
elimination of the Thursday's classes;
second adding an extra exam day
Sunday afternoon (if the first day of
exams were eliminated); third, move
Thursady’s classes to the previous
Saturday.

Dean Atwood felt that the first
alternative would be rejected com-
pletely by the faculty as they have
already given up a great deal of their
class hours to accomodate no Satur-
day classes. He then wondered what
the sentiment was among the students
as to the other alternatives. In a poll
of the IFC, they indicated that they
favored a Saturday class over a
Sunday afternoon exam.

Clark Carter also announced that
the IFC Judicial Board is accepting
applications for the chairmanship of
next year’s Contact program. Carter
announced also that Andrew Wynd-
ham had been appointed chairman of
the IFC's upcoming Blood Drive.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion Of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s T'wice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, February 18, 1969

A matter of excellence

Contact was superb. The entire five-day affair was well
planned and executed, enlightening and lively, and—for a
pleasant change—the title was relevant to the discussions and
lectures. Another pleasant change was that the first guests
were as interesting as the top-billed McGovern. Mr. Hinkle,
chairman, deserves a warm expression of appreciation for
using $5,000 to put together an excellent symposium.

 

Presented for your interest

The faculty survey which appears above right is published
more out of a sense of curiosity on our part than for any
other purpose. Surveys of this kind are difficult—if not
dangerous—to interpret as there are so many qualifications in
each man’s mind as he answers ‘yes’ or ‘no’ or ‘no answer.’

We would, nevertheless, venture to say that a short-term
plan for Washington and Lee, in some form, appears to be
favored by a majority of the faculty and not disliked by many;
this is one of the most encouraging aspects of the survey.

Recalcitrance and revision

Last week we pointed out some of the many burdensome
provisions of the Executive Committee’s proposed exam
schedule, which we had hoped would prompt that august
body to reconsider its suggested revisions. Instead, the EC’s
Staman Ogilvie wrote an ill-considered letter to The Friday
Ring-tum Phi in which he tried to justify the format of the
proposed schedule.

We don’t buy his arguments.

No matter how many exams there are in one day or how
many days of the week on which exams may be taken, it
still remains fact that the present schedule contains fourteen
days, the proposed schedule ten days. Why must these four
days be given up? For grading, as in the EC’s proposal?
(Meanwhile, the students get a four-day holiday, which, as
we said last week, we’d rather have for studying.) No, these
four days are useless for grading purposes—if Mr. Ogilvie
had studied the exam systems at other schools, he would have
noted that neither Davidson, Mary Baldwin, nor Hollins ex-
periences a deluge of last-day exams.

And we still don’t understand 1) why the schedule must
be set two weeks beforehand or 2) why so much must be
signed (etc.) in order to take an exam. Sure, a student can
fix his schedule in advance. But why? And Mr. Ogilvie’s
rationalization about the honor system and “clerical errors”
is pure hoopla. Sign a card to receive an exam, sign the same
card when the exam is returned. Big deal. Why do we need
anything more? We don’t.

Our intention here is not, as we tried to point out last
week, to demean either the idea of exam revision or the job
done by Mr. Ogilvie. We feel, however, that in its excite-
ment to obtain the much-needed reform, the Executive Com-
mittee has neglected to provide for a workable, simple alter-

native.

 

Staff editorial

The faculty as a legislature {11}

We were reminded of our thoughts on the faculty as a
legislature during the IFC debate last Monday over allowing
combos to play Friday nights. The channels of power became
painfully clear to all present at that meeting. The faculty
has been delegated complete authority over student life and
any potential change must first be filtered by the Student
Affairs Committee (SAC) and then presented to the entire
faculty.

The effectiveness of this procedure is shown by the various
proposed reforms passed by the IFC several months ago. To-
day, they are still being considered and shelved by the SAC.
There will be even further delay in these measures because
at the direction of the faculty the SAC is considering modifica-
tion of the pareital rules for the freshman class.

We do not, and cannot, deny the faculty its legitimacy
in exercising this authority. It has this power delegated to it
by the Board of Trustees. But we do ask—Is this the most
expedient way? Is this way in the best interest of both the
student body and the University as a whole? We feel the
answer to both these questions is no! Would not Washington
and Lee be a better university if the faculty ordered the
academic life and the students ordered the students’ life?

We definitely feel that the creation of a joint IFC Judicial
Board-Student Control Committee with power to formulate as
well as enforce policy over all facets of student life would
be an invaluable extension of student government and student
responsibility,

A professor should not have to weigh the merits and de-
merits of a Friday night combo party or the hours at which
all girls must be officially out of the fraternities, The faculty
should be here to teach and guide and not to be concerned
with the rules and regulations of student and fraternity life.

—R.W.K.

From the J-School

 

By LAURENCE M, HILLIARD
Columnist

Everybody knows the American
college campuses “where the action
is”"—Berkley, Chicago et al. So last
summer Esquire magazine set out to
discover the campuses where the
action is not. Esquire asked eight
conservative organizations to recom-
mend a list of nice conservative col-
leges. (Freely translated, that means
colleges which have not shown any
forward-looking trends since the Mid-
dle Ages.)

One of the organizations, that self-
righteous defender of American pa-
triotism——the Daughters of the Ameri-
can Revolution, submitted a list of
thirteen colleges—including Washing-
ton and Lee. Thus, according to the
D.A.R., W&L is one of a select 13
of the nation’s 2,000 colleges and uni-
versities which are most noteworthy
for their lack of practically anything
conducive to a modernized collegiate
scene. Boy does that hurt! Even
V.M.L. was not on the list.

Is this a fair evaluaion of W&L?
You bet your life it is! Apathy is
a way of life at all 220 year-old
universities in Lexington, Virginia.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not ad-
vocating that we burn down Wash-
ington Hall, with Deans Pusey and
Atwood inside. Who do you think
I am, Jack Horowitz? But I do feel
that there is a definite need for more
student involvement in all areas.

Who's to blame for W&L’s position
on Esquire’s black list—the students

 

ean SL

or the administration? The answer is
that they're both to blame.

The student body is in no way a
representative cross section of the
American population. Students are
about 99% from upper middle class
or wealthy backgrounds. This wealthy
conservative background is hardly
conducive to the radical and creative
thinking that is daily changing our
world. As far as the W&L stud is
concerned, a major catastrophe is not
being able to find a date for Saturday
night.

The administration claims that it is
attempting to make the enrollment
more representative. But every Sep-
tember, with a few exceptions, we
see the same students arrive for
Freshman Camp—well-groomed hair,
conservatively dressed, 65% from
Southern and Border States. Token
integration does not change the pic-
ture.

And how much power is given to
the students? Very little. We have a
student E.C. and a thousand other
committees. But the faculty has virt-
ual veto power over all of their de-
cisions. Two years ago, the E.C.
presented a referendum asking the
students what speakers they would
like invited to campus to speak under
the U.C.A. program. S.N.C.C. leader
Stokley Carmichael and Mario Savio,
leader of the Berkley Free Speech
movement, were among the top vote
getters. But the administration turned
thumbs down of these two because

 

 

W&L & the DAR go hand in hand

they did not represent religious groups
—in other words, they were too con-
troversial,

Contact is sponsored by the stu-
dents, yet they have absolutely no
say in who will be invited to speak.
Contact would certainly be of greater
interest to the students if they had
at least some say in the selection of
speakers. This year’s speakers were
all experts in their fields, but who can
really get excited over a science critic
and an economist, both unknown to
the majority of the students?

The Executive Committee should
be a force to encourage student
activity. But who can honestly say
he has been spurred to greater things
by the E.C.? Jay Passavant came up
with an excellent idea toward this
goal—the “Bitch-in.” But only four
E.C. members bothered to show up.
If the majority of the E.C. decided
the “Bitch-In” was not worth their
time, how can the students be ex-
pected to show an interest?

The university that refuses to cater
to all but a select portion of the col-
legiate community, the university that
is dictatorial in its administration, will
always be deserving of inclusion
among the campuses where the action
is not. But there is still hope for
WAL. Robert Shelton, Grand Im-
perial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan,
refused to recommend any colleges as
safely conservative because “some lib-
eral instructors and trends” were
found at every campus investigated.
Maybe these trends will be able to
assert themselves—even at W&L.

to bear | was going to feel out the
story of Contact ‘69 and tell what
it was all about. You see, | had my
plans.

I cleared everything before I start-
ed. Got myself invited to all the
“in” events: “I'd like to attend the
cocktail parties,” | said. “You see,
I have this column. Pm a reporter.”
Ali the inside stuff, that is what I
wanted. | had to get close enough to
really make Contact *69.

Things were going quite well for
a while. Tuesday and Wednesday
went by without a hitch. Jack Thomas
and Ralph Lapp were here. “While
society is racist.” “Our scientific
community must stand up to the
dictates of the business and military
establishment.” They both described
a need for individual moral consci-
ousness. Walter Adams was schedul-
ed to appear next.

I] met Adams for the first time at
Dean Atwood's home—the scene of
the Contact cocktail parties and re-
ception—on Wednesday evening. He
smoked cigars, told funny stories,
and had a very independent air about
him: I quickly became a fan of his.
lt was on Thursday that Adams de-
livered his prepared speech and took
part in a seminar. By that time he
had totally disarmed me. When his
talk in Lee chapel drew to a close
| hopped out of my pew to do a
litte hero worshipping: “Mr. Adams,
you and Lapp have got to cut it
out, knocking the industrial-military-
scientific establishment like this, You
two afe sounding too much like
SDS.” And he smiled.

Wandering thru a week of Contact

Later that evening, most of the
guests had left the Atwoods’. Adams
and I were seated in a corner of
the living room. He was honest with
me and | with him: how an economist
and over-thirty individual concerned
with the questions that precocious
America is raising for all; how an
emotionally involved young man de-
velops a living philosophy that is
the proper mix between humanitarian
(Sorry, Dr, Futch) and personal con-
siderations, Ii wasn't a debate; no
contest of competing ideas. Just two
guys talking straight; a meal to feed
their sense of humanity.

My plans were working. | was
really getting the meat of what Con-
tact was about—the story behind the
story. Norman, Jimmy, Pete; | was
on my way.

But then came the crush. Friday
afternoon, Dr, Silber was speaking in

continuing to suck up all the facts
and color available. My next article

tion and understanding of Contact

And then | raised my hand to
ask Dr. Silber a question. That was
the start of my fall. That afternoon

Letters
To he Editor

Contact congrats

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Although this section of your
paper is generally used for complaints
and criticism, I would like to use it
for another purpose. It is very easy
to criticize another student for a job
poorly done, but we seldom see one
student congratulate another for a job
well done. Thus, I thank and con-
gratulate Sam Hinkle and his com-
mittee for an outstanding job in
presenting Contact 1969,

s/Greg Parker, '69

 

Seminars cover
numerous topics

Dr, Duvall gives a lecture entitled
“Observations on the Southern Ro-
mance;” Dr. Kimbrough speaks on
“Current Fertility Trends in America.”
Such events as these are not unusual
in themselves, but they do seem
strange when you consider that they
were topics presented in chemistry
seminars last year at Washington and
Lee.

Working on the premise that chem-
istry seminars can be both useful and
fun, Drs. James K. Shillington and
William J. Watt of the chemistry de-
partment have developed a program
which meets these two goals. Most
of the topics discussed in the seminars
pertain in some way to chemistry. In
order to provide students and guests
with a broad background of knowl-
edge, however, professors from the
different departments of the University
are invited to speak on subjects that
are not related to chemistry in any
way.

Besides providing a means of dis-
cussing ideas about chemistry and
other topics, the seminars also serve
as a means of educating students on
the proper manner of delivering
speeches before groups. The speaker,
whether he is Dr. Hodges speaking
on “Science and God” or Dr. Whitney
lecturing on “Boranes and Cubanes,”
provides an example of how to con-
duct a seminar. The lecurers’ hope is
that the students will learn from them
and be better able to present their
own seminars,

The chemistry seminar program
was begun in the spring of 1954 by
Dr. Shillington and was at first simply
a chemistry discussion group. Dr.
Watt later became involved with the
seminars after he came to WAL.

The usual format of the seminar
program calls for twenty-six to
twenty-nine each year. All seminars
are Open to anyone wishing to attend.

The directors of the program try to
schedule as lecturers four faculty

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Wrestlers beaten by ODC

Last Saturday, the Generals were*
defeated by the Old Dominion Mon-
archs. The grapplers were beaten in
Norfolk to the tune of 33-13.

With four exceptions, the Generals
were stuck in every class. Buzz White,
Razz Rasberry, Wes Pullman, Bill
West, Clarke Carter, and Dave Hig-
gins were all pinned. Jay Thiemeyer
lost by decision.

The picture brightened in the
heavier classes, but it was to late. Dan
Webster and Dee Copenhaver pinned
their opponents; and Jay Clarke won
by decision.

Tuesday, Doremus Gymnasium will
be the scene of a Wahoo-General
contest. Although Virginia boasts a
good team this year, reports indicate
that they will not provide the type of
competition which has outclassed
WAL earlier in the season,

The Generals will be at Sewanee
Friday for this year’s College Athletic
Conference tournament. Last year,
the grapplers finished second in the
tournament; but Coach Miller be-
lieves that, with a win over Sewanee,
the Generals would come out on top.
Thus, a clean sweep of the C.A.C,
after a winless season is a definite
possibility.

A detailed analysis of the season
so far plus Coach Miller’s view on
C.A.C. meet can be found in John
Robinson’s column on this page. *

 

   

 

 

Sports in General ...

 

By JOHN ROBINSON

Last year, Washington and Lee’s
wrestling team had to settle for sec-
ond place in the C.A.C. tournament,
just ten points behind Sewanee. Ac-
cording to Coach Miller, the Gen-
erals hope to turn the tables on
Sewanee on February 21 and 22.

That might sound a little too
optimistic for a team that has posted
a losing record to date. But when you
consider W&L’s competition through-
out the season, you can understand
the problems our squad has faced,
What other team at this university can
boast opponents like North Carolina,
Loyola, N.C. State, and the Uni-
versity of Virginia on its schedule?
Coach Miller summarized the opposi-
tion by saying, “They're all tough
for us this year,”

Several of the wrestlers have post-
ed outstanding individual records.
Coach Miller called Danny Webster
“the outstanding performer with a 7-1
record.” Miller also called Clark
Carter the most improved, despite the

fact that he had drawn some of the
toughest opposition all season.

Team Captain Clark
Team captain Jay Clarke has been
wrestling in the unlimited class all

in a lower weight bracket. Jay has
a 3-3 record even against wrestlers
weighing up to two hundred and
sixty pounds. Dee Copenhaver also
has a winning record of 2-1. Bill
West, Jimmy Hooker, Buzz White,
and Wes Pullman are younger team
members who have also shown a
great deal of promise.

Why, however, do the Generals
stand such a good chance in the
C.A.C. tournament? First of all,
Washington and Lee has faced much

members of the College Athletic
Conference. The team to beat, ac-
cording to Coach Miller, is Sewanee.
Fortunately, the Generals have four
defending C.A.C. champions return-
ing: Razz Rasberry, Jay Clarke, Danny
Webster, and Jay Thiemeyer. The
real test for the wrestling team is,
after all, the conference tournament;
this is the one that really counts and
WAL’s men have a great deal of
confidence.

To sum up the season so far, Coach
Miller told this reporter: “The record
isn’t very invpressive, but all the boys
have done an excellent job this sea-
son.”

night's match,

Natators lose

Over the last weekend, the Gen-,
eral’s swimming team lost a closely
fought meet with West Virginia Uni- |
versity 61-43, while winning a meet
against West Virginia Wesleyan 66-
38 and winning an unofficial meet
against Penn State 76-24.

Against West Virginia University,
the natators put up a strong fight
which saw many outstanding  indi-
vidual performances, The Generals
managed to win the opening 400 yard
medley relay with the team of Billy
Ball (backstroke), John Lawlor
(breastroke), Bim Clark (butterfly),
and Bill Brumback (freestyle) with a
winning time of 3:53.0 which was a
new CAC conference record, a W&L
school record, and a WVU pool
record. Lawlor, after a quick re-
covery from the relay, then managed
to capture a second in the 1000 yard
freestyle falling three seconds behind
the WVU swimmer. Lawlor gained
sweet revenge as he defeated the WVU
swimmer in the 500 yard freestyle
passing him in the last two lengths

to WVa, win

After the relay the West Virginia
swimmers shut out W&L from the
first place slot for the next six events,
Hal Catlin captured a second in the
200 yard freestyle; Ross Forman a
second in the 50 yard freestyle being
touched out by .4 seconds; Ball gained
a second in the 200 yard individual
medley.

The General's finally roused, turn-
ed on the steam and won the 100
yard freestyle, the 200 yard back-
stroke, and the 500 yard freestyle,
but it was too late and with a Moun-
taineer win in the 200 yard breast-
stroke they had the meet cinched,
Brumback won the 100 yard free-
style with a time of 50.4 seconds,
Ball won the 200 back with a time
of 2:15.1 after being challenged three
quarters of the way by a West
Virginia swimmer.

Friday afternoon, against West
Virginia Wesleyan, Coach Stearns ex-
perimented with many changes from
his usual line-up to see how he might
best deploy the team in the CAC

 

of the race.

Generals defeat Davis-Elkins

Saturday W&L traveled to Davis-
Elkins College and returned with its
17th victory of the season. The score
was 76-67 as the Generals disappoint-
ed the homecoming crowd at Davis-
Elkins.

The game was neither impressive
nor disappointing for our Generals.
Washington and Lee felt confident
they could take the game, and did
so. Mel Cartwright led the scoring
with 26 with Mike Neer close behind
with 24 points.

Davis-Elkins came out hot in the
first half and gained an early lead.
But Charlie Stone, who ended up
with 15 points, was just as hot. His
shooting enabled the Generals to gain
and retain the lead. Davis-Elkins used
a zone defense throughout the first
period, primarily in an attempt to
gain a rebounding advantage.

A man-to-man defense was thrown
against W&L in the second half. So
Mel Cartwright moved under the
basket, to team up with Neer, who
had been plagued with a sagging de-

 

two others while away

vard medley relay team of Roger
Martin, Rick Sands, Hal Catlin, and
Ross Forman cruised to an easy vic-
tory.

Lawlor, a distance freestyle and
breastroke specialist, and Ball, a back-
stroke and individual medley man,
captured second and third respectively
in the 200 yard freestyle. Bill Brum-
back and Roger Martin then went
1-2 in the S50 yard freestyle. John
Lawlor, again showing off his versa-
tility captured a first in the 200 yard
butterfly, supported by Bert Meem
who gained second, Brumback and
Forman, in their usual positions,
gained a first and second in the 100
yard freestyle while Ball and Catlin
went 1-2 in the 200 yard backstroke.

that this is frequently the situation.
Many students are dissatisfied —“very
many, and don't kid yourself”—some
are disillusioned and few are actually
destructive.

But with the proper oratory plus
good news coverage, this table of
ranks is easily altered, even if only
for a short time.

To defend this point McDowell re-
ferred to the march on the Pentagon
last spring. This affair received “10,-
000 miles of coverage” in words and
on tape from Walter Cronkite to
Harper's, Atlantic, and Norman
Mailer. The humor of the situation
was that the affair was not at all as
severe as it seemed,

The only times trouble threatened
were when the camera lights would
turn on, when the innocent flick of
a switch served to turn the crowds
on and off as quick as the lights.
Finally, McDowell posed the obvious
question by asking whether a severe
quick riot at Bridgewater (or, WAL
for that matier) could possibly equal
in effect the small knot of students
sitting in the street outside the
Pentagon, if a TV camera was not
immediately available.

not being prepared. The home pushes
its children from grade school to
high school to college, fearful that
they may not be ready at some step.
In college, we feel the pressure to
commit ourselves to preparing for
life through various organizations.
But college offers four years in which
we must break the push if we are
ever able to, The treat to education
lies less in the institution than in this
pressure to stand behind beliefs which
are veritable shields against educa-
tion.

Students seeking receptivity instead
of beliefs in college will be far ahead
in their chances of eventually having
viable and valuable beliefs after col-
lege. Student activism is preverted
towards committed ends when activ-
ism should be directed toward find-
ing ends, The organizations tearing
down or lending support to the
Organization are equally neurotic
when students are pushed into them.

 

Contact 1969 was surely no failure.
| Audiences did listen attentively; some
| perhaps will go on to explore what
| they were introduced to by a Contact
‘speaker. But the prospect of greater

success requires that next year’s Con-

j tact committee and any others who
| take Contact seriously, try to answer
| questions like those suggested here.
| These are questions appropriate in
planning. If planning is well done
| they should not be raised as a result
} of Contact 1970,

A final note: The attendance of
Friday evening and Saturday morning
shows that students may well be will-
ing to continue their education
through the weekend, even if class-
room doors have been barred against
them. Perhaps Contact has already
encouraged the idea that a lecture
or a concert is a good start for a
Friday or Saturday evening with one’s
date—that education can and does
continue beyond five class days and
beyond classrooms.
