Choose A Candidate--If You Can...

For many of us this will be our first op-
portunity to vote in a national presidential
election. And frankly, we are disillusioned.

We are disillusioned about the national
nominating conventions; we are disatisfied
with the hypocrisy of politics, i.e., saying one
thing to get votes and doing another; we
object to the electoral college which com-
pletely ignores the minority vote in a state;
and, above all, we are unhappy about the
candidates we have to choose from. We will
shed no tear at the repudiation of the incum-
bent Administration, and raise no cheer at
the prospect of Richard Nixon in the White
House.

Neither Humphrey nor Nixon has spok-
en the truth on Vietnam— that this never
was a war that should have been fought by
the United States. Nor has either said, even
in general terms, how he thinks the conflict
can be brought to an end without further loss
of life and destruction. Humphrey’s oppon-
ents argue that they have not been in charge
and are not therefore responsible for this
disaster. This is a valid but weak defense,
since neither Nixon nor Wallace has criticized
the essentials of the Johnson policy. They are
freer than Humphrey to speak, but they have
not said anything meaningful.

This does not make the Vice President
any less guilty. He, too, has had a chance to
get off the Johnson line. He might have en-
dorsed the moderate minority position on
Vietnam at the Democratic National Conven-
tion. Instead, he supported the extremists,
and he defended the police for clubbing and
gassing protesters in the streets. Our thoughts
on Humphrey are not enhanced when we
hear that privately he really has had grave
doubts about the bombing. The Administra-
tion policies to which Humphrey gave himself
ardently are now to be judged. This is the
way it should be. And this hurts him, too, un-
less he repudiates them.

Hubert Humphrey, we believe, is no war
lover. But neither is Nixon or Lyndon John-
son. (We can’t be sure about George Wallace
and his ridiculous sidekick LeMay.) We as-
sume that both of the major candidates would
get us out of Vietnam, because of strong
pressures to shift the balance of national
expenditures more heavily onto the side of
domestic issues. Militant protest will make a
new Administration’s life hard if it does not
make peace. In addition, any new Adminis-
tration will do something for the ghettoes.
Humphrey, the nominee more willing to use
public resources to meet public needs, has

For Your Vote Must Be Counted

By not coming out for any presidential
candidate, we don’t want to infer that we
should sit the election out. It would be a
catastrophe if everyone did this.

There are several reasons for voting this
year, even if none of the candidates is very
attractive. First, the freedom to vote for
whomever we wish is one of our most sacred
rights. We have this right and we should be
proud of it. We have defended and are de-
fending foreign countries so that they may
enjoy the same freedom.

A second reason why we should vote
is to make our voices heard in Congress.
There are many excellent candidates running
for Congressional seats who need our sup-
port. Even if we cannot get the man we want
for President, we may be able to get Con-
gressmen from our districts who sympathize
with us and will take our views to Washing-
ton. It is a disgusting thing for people to
complain about national policy when they

will not go out of their way to vote for the

made constructive proposals about federal
investment in urban renewal and education.
He has the confidence of the black communi-
ty, as the polls show Nixon does not, which
will help him in winning racial peace. In the
final analysis, racial peace will be won by
goodwill and good works, not by force.

This much being said, it must be added
that when the disarray of the Democratic
Party, the anger and frustration of the young,
the rise of right-wing radicalism and the prob-
ability of a more conservative Congress in
1969 are taken into account, it his hard to
visualize Humphrey’s gaining enough sup-
port as President to cope with our crises. Com-
mentators like Walter Lippman believe this.
He says that a Republican Administration
could more easily end the war without stirring
up the rabid anti-communists. In all his poli-
cies Nixon’s middle-of-the-road philosophy
would keep the country’s elements equally
appeased.

Nixon has evidently changed. He has be-
come more genial and secure. His organiza-
tion is flawless and he is surrounded by smart
people. But has he really changed? The mem-
ories of the past mar the picture for the
future. The record of Nixon’s rise to eminence
on the backs of suspected “subversives,” of
his uninvolvement with any of the central
problems of our society and of his showman-
ship in Latin America and in the Soviet
Union still linger with us.

His stands on current issues are vague.
If Nixon differs with the present Secretary
of State about the prudent use of American
military or diplomatic power, it is not evident.
His references to “de-Americanizing” the war
are unclear and sound like those of Johnson.
He is for civil rights, but would be reluctant
to use the money power of the federal gov-
ernment to see that they are enforced. He
offers his faith that subsidized free enterprise
will find jobs for the unemployed, educate
the poorly skilled and build low-income hous-
ing. At the same time, he suggests it can all be
done while raising defense expenditures, cut-
ting the budget and cutting taxes. He favors
“black capitalism,” but gives no clue to the
means by which poor Negroes, lacking funds
or managerial experience, are to create their
own businesses.

Then there’s Agnew. Compared to Mus-
kie . . . well, there is no comparison.
If we felt we could endorse either Hum-

phrey or Nixon, we would, Choose if you can.
We can’t.

candidates who will be entrusted with the re-
sponsibilities of representing them.

The most important reason for us to
vote is to stop George Wallace. It is imper-
ative we do this now or Wallace and his phil-
osophy will influence government policies for
many years to come. The larger the percen-
age of the vote Wallace compiles on election
day, the more influence he will hold. Many
people in this country will be voting for Wal-
lace either in protest of the other two candi-
dates or because they are scared of the black
man, Wallace is catering to these peoples’
emotions and is winning their votes.

It is up to us, as educated people, to see
through his fale, “home-spun” oratory. It is
important that we vote for the presidential

 

candidate in our respective states who has the
best chance of stopping the Wallace tide.

For those of us at Washington and Lee, |
the next four years will be important in de-|
termining our futures. To paraphrase one |
candidate, vote as if your world depended on |
it. It might.

 

Campaign ’68: 3 Hats In the Ring

 

Humphrey Faces Lots Of “Ifs”

By BOB GIAMMITTORIO

The Humphrey campaign now, a
little less than two weeks away from
election day, is beleagered ‘by many
“ifs.” If Nixon and Wallace don’t gain
any more, if Democrats get out and
vote, and if some of the labor vote
switches from Wallace, then Hubert
Humphrey will have a good chance
at the Presidency,

But the conjunction I prefer to use
regarding the campaign is “why.” Why
are so many people enamored by a
demogogue who promises changes he
will never be able to effect and who
threatens with a shaking fist the very
nature of our Democracy? Why are
so many people rallying behind a
third-rate politician who has no ma-
jor accomplishments to his credit in
the field of government and who buys
support by promising to cater to pri-
vate interests? Why have these people
sought to ignore the positive credent-
ials of a man who has had twenty
years of experience in all levels of
politics and public administration?

The answer is plainly that some
people have become dissatisfied with

Nixon’s

Richard Nixon is the candidate
who can best unite our country. It is
not trite campaign rhetoric to say
that our country has rarely been so
factionalized. Mr. Nixon as candidate
of the center can build a moderate
government capable of meeting the
challenges we face. Mr. Humphrey is
handicapped by his shattered party
and his espousal of the policies of
the 1930's. Mr. Wallace has no real
party and his policies could not be
implemented.

The campaign we are now witness-
ing is excellent testimony of Nixon's
ability to inspire unity. Who would
have thought that Strom Thurmond
and Nelson Rockefeller would ever
go to the stump for the same candi-
date? The Republican Party is united
and is prepared to assume power with
a broad-based electorate. The Nixon
Administration is preparing to infuse
Washington with many new bright
young faces with equally new ideas.
The United States has changed since
the 1930's the Nixonites are prepared
to introduce new policies,

the way that the Democrats have
been running the country for the last
eight years. This attitude, however,
is flatly unfounded and unrealistic.
How in a period of unequaled eco-
nomic prosperity and social equality
can the public want something dif-
ferent? The bone of contention can-
not be the War in Viet Nam because
the three candidates have presented
views on the war that are essentially
the same. One would suspect that
Nixon and Wallace have gathered
around them a group of selfish people
who are intent on serving their own
interests, whether they be re-insti-
tution of racial segreation, the stifl-
ing of the right to dissent or the

accumulation of private wealth.

The wide split in the differing ap-
proaches of Humphrey and his closest
rival can be exemplified by Nixon's

slogan “Vote as if your life depended
on it.” Nixon’s refusal to debate
whether or not he would sign a ban
on nuclear weapons, and his con-
tinued silence on his method of end-
ing the Viet Nam War all indicate
(Continued on Page 4)

peal Is

In absolute contrast to the Nixon
campaign is the dismal Humphrey
campaign, There are few new faces,
his policies promise more spending to
solve al Ithe problems, and the Demo-
cratic Party has rarely been in such
disarray. If Humphrey is elected he
will face a hostile Congress. Nixon
hopes for a Republican House, but
even if it is Democratic he will not
stir the antagonisms that Humphrey
will arouse. A Democrat House will
be that way only because of over-
whelming Southern membership. And
these Southerners will not identify
with Humphrey for fear of sure
electoral defeat.

There is litthe question that a Wal-
lace Administration would be the
most divisive. Regardless of his in-
tentions to “Stand Up For America”
the vast majority of Americans are
frightened of him. The Negro com-
munity I fear would rebel and so
would many alarmed citizens. Mr.
Wallace would only sharpen differ-
ences that now exist, for example his
Madison Square Garden rally Thurs-

Wallace: A Man Of The People

This year, as in few years past,
America has a full-fledged three way
race for the Presidency. The Amer-
ican Independent Party of candidate
George C. Wallace is causing more
excitement than any political move-
ment in years.

Never before has a man come
close to doing what Governor Wal-
ace is doing this year. Starting with
nothing but a bad national image,
Walace has formed his own party,
met ballot requirements in all $0
states, set up a nationwide organiza
tion of political workers. named one

political circuit. In addition to this,
the polls now show Wallace with 20
to 25% of the vote and more elec-
toral votes than Vice President Hum-
phrey.

What, politicians all over the
world are asking, is the secret to
Wallace's success? What is it that has
enabled this man to overcome the
most difficult obstacles and emerge as
one of America’s most powerful po-
litical leaders?

The answer to this question prob.
ably lies in the fact that Governor
Wallace is talking straight to the
average man on the street. Wallace
realizes the problems the average
American is facing, he knows what
needs to be done to solve these prob-
lems and he uses brilliant campaign
rhetoric to convey his message. The
people listen to George Wallace, and
they like what they hear. Thus, he
is able to amass thousands of dedi-
yo supporters with every campaign

is the basic plan that has been in|

Conceived by Dr. William Garret

department, the bi-weekly schedule |
was designed in answer to criticism
leveled against the six day, one week |

The dissatisfaction resulted from |
repeated complaints by faculty mem-|
bers who were concerned with in
creased absenses from Saturday class
es. They pointed out that, due to}
the marked decline in Saturday atend

material covered in Saturday classes |

Lynchburg Plan

(Continued from Page 1)

Lunch is from 1:20 p.m. to 1:55
p.m.

rhis plan is similar to the one pre-
sented to the faculty by Dr. Robert
S. Johnson, except that in his plan
there was no provision for a universal
lunch beark. Classes would have end-
ed at 4 p.m.

rhe plan, presented to the faculty
by student body president Jay Pas-
savant, will go to the faculty comit-
tee for the five-day week to have the
details of implementation worked out.
It will be submitted to the faculty
for final vote on November 4, pro-
vided the committee can finish its
work by then. If approved it will be
decided at that time when the pro-
gram, which can easily go into affect
next semester, will be started.

week or “B” week. Consequently, a
course which meets on Tuesday-
Thursday of the “A” week meets on
Monday-Wednesday-Friday on “B”
week. Although frightfully confusing
when explained in this manner, the
system is quite easy to institute and
has proven itself very operative.
Another departure from the ordi-
nary six-day schedule is the extension
of classes from fifty minutes to a
full hour. The result is that, in two
weeks of five days each, the course
has the same classroom time as it
had with Saturday classes. In this
regard, Dean Turner emphasized the
fact that teachers favored 60 minute
classes, particularly when giving tests.
Overall, the system has proven its
optimal efficiency by being accept-
able to both students and faculty
members. Elimination of Saturday
classes, the uniformity of class meet-
ings and the increased flexibility avail-
able for students in scheduling classes
has benifited the entire community
of Lynchburg College.

that if his answers to these problems
were publicly known, it would hurt
his chances of becoming president.
Hubert Humphrey has not minced any
words about his solutions to these
problems, and if they are ignored,
it will be a sad time for this country
and its people.

As for specific predictions about
the outcome of the elections, it must
be sai dthat the Humphrey-Muskie
ticket still has a fighting chance to
win. Their winning is not dependent
on snatching Republican votes from
Nixon or solid-south votes from Wal-
lace. It is dependent on the vote of
every loyal Democrat, They must woo
from the comfortable living rooms
and the favorite fishing hole the
people would vote the Democratic
Ticket, if they vote at all,

Some mention must be made here
of the choice of Vice-Presidential
candidates, because, as we all have
been painfully aware since 1963, the
chances of a vice-president ascending
to the presidency, are quite real. Only
Hubert Humphrey has sought to offer
to the American people a distinguish-
ed and able public servant as a vice-
presidential candidate, Edmund
Muskie has had a long and notable
career in the Senate and as Governor
of Maine. He has arisen in this cam-
paign as a true American statesman.

Nixon’s choice has had a political
career that defies all rational ex-
planation. From the mangership of
Shriber's Meat Market in Baltimore
to the governorship of Maryland in
Annapolis, Spiro Agnew has risen
only by default of the opposing forces.
His experience in state-level politics
is based on a partial term as gov-
ernor. His experience on the national
level is non-existant. Could the citi-

An extensive critique of George
Wallace’s running mate could not be
attempted here, for it would take
entirely too many agate lines, and
would most likely result in the burn-
ing and melting of the writer's type-
writer. Suffice it to say that if any
one could imagine Curtis Le May as
president of the United States whirl-

day. As for his ability to deal with
Congress if elected, his lack of any
party loyalty would make him an
impotent President.

Therefore the only candidate who
will have any ability to deal with
Congress is Richard M. Nixon.
Whether you admire the policies of
Humphrey or worship the programs
of Wallace, they will probably re-
main campaign oratory even if elected.

Mr. Nixon seems certain of a tre-
mendous victory. The latest Gallup,
Time, and Associated Press polls in-
dicate a virtual landslide for Nixon
and humiliation for Humphrey. Even
Lou Harris, the Democrat poll-master
of 1960, concedes Nixon is the fa-
vorite.

four more years of Democratic rule
it could become overwhelming.

It is certain that the past four
years have disillusioned many Ameri-

new leadership. Nixonites do not con-
tend that January 20, 1969, will mark
the beginning of Utopia, but it will

Wallace

The Wallace platform is appealing
to the average American who has
watched his country deteriorate dur-
ing the past years. These Americans
feel it is time for common sense in
government's highest level. They iden-
tify with Governor Wallace. He is
a man of the people.

The most surprising thing about
the Wallace movement is the nation-
wide momentum and enthusiasm it is
building. Support has sky-rocketed.
Because of this, it is now entirely
possible that George C, Wallace will
be elected President.

Many people doubt this can hap-

pen. | would ask them to consider
the following simple but possible
blue-print for his victory. Wallace

could fairly easily carry the entire
South and Border States. This would
give him 176 electorial votes. Also,
Governor Wallace could carry several
Northern, Eastern and Western
States. Included in this group might
be Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan,
Arizona, Illinois, Massachusetts,
Pennsylvania, California and others.
These states would give him the one
hundred additional electorial votes
needed and he would be elected.
Some people find it difficult to vis-
ualize Governor Wallace winning
states such as Illinois, Michigan, Penn-

sylvania and California. What one
must remember is that Humphrey
and Nixon are likely to run very
close to each other in these states,
Thus, Governor Wallace could carry
a state with 35 percent to 40 percent
of the vote. If one thinks Wallace is
incapable of amassing such percent-
ages outside the South, perhaps it
would be wise to review Wallace’s
vote in the Northern primaries he
entered in 1964. During that year,
when Liberalism was at its peak and
President Johnson was considered un-
beatable, Governor Wallace took up
to 45 percent of the vote.

The election is still two weeks away
and anything can happen. However,
if his movement continues to grow
between now and November 5, I
think that Governor George Wallace
will be the next President of the
United States. If he is, November 5
will be one of the greatest days in
American history!
