will face each other Monday in a
runoff election for the office of Presi-

plurality in yesterday's election, but
failed to produce the necessary ab-

from the ballot.

Proposed curriculum changes also

Referendum Results

Laramie, Wyoming, polled 357 votes
to edge Honig, rising KA senior
from Houston, who had 339. Sandler,
ZBI from Norfolk, had 284, Charley
Whipple, a Beta from Columbia,
South Carolina, came up with 95
write-in votes.

Tompkins, sophomore Executive
Committeeman, and Dobbins, current
President of the Junior Class, both
polled more than 1000 votes. They
had been upopposed throughout the
campaign and their names were alone
on the ballot.

Bass, a rising Sigma Chi senior
from Little Rock, Arkansas, had 386
votes compared to 348 for Coursen,
a Phi Psi junior from Washington.
Neither could obtain a majority due
to the candidacy of Bart Taylor, Phi
Kap law student who received 229
voles as a strong write-in candidate.

Curriculum Changes Upheld

Wasingion and Lee students agreed
by almost 20 to | that the university | -
needs curriculum change as suggested
by the Faculty and Student Curri-
culum Committees. On the question
of calendar changes, 544 expressed
a preference for a 12-12-6 format
with the “independent” study pro-
gram coming at the end of the year.
Ninety-two voted for a 12-6-12 pro-
cedure and 155 favored retention of
the present system. On the subject
of distribution requirements, students
expressed a rather marked interest in
the “majority proposal,” whereby a
minimum of 6 credits would be re-
quired in each of four established
divisions, one could not satisfy both
major and distribution requirements,
and it would be preferable that re-
quirements be fulfilled by the close
of the sophomore year. Over 200 stu-

dents cast ballots in favor of the
“minority” proposal which includes
more stringent distribution require-

ments, and 122 favored the present
system.

Whipple Stoic In Defeat

The large turnout for yesterday's
voting appears to have temporarily
belied the charge of student apathy
that became so apparent during Wed-
nesday’s nighi’s voluntary assembly
for the candidates, Certainly apathy
and disinterest does not appear to
reign in one camp. Charley Whipple,
defeated a write-in candidate in
each of the Big Four Elections, was

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi
Hriday

Friday, April 18, 1969

SWEDE HENBERG

One of the most important issues which
comes up at Washington and Lee is the
annual election of student body officers.

Each year the Wé&L student community
has the opportunity to select the three men
who will serve as its primary leaders. Of these
three, the president in particular has a posi-
tion which enable him to largely determine
the vigor and success of student government.
The strength and character of the leadership
he provides is reflected both in the spirit of
the student body and in the effectiveness of
the Executive Committee as a forum for the
voice of the students.

The responsibilities of the office make it
essential that its holder be a person of genuine
foresight so that he may persue the path of
progress.

For this reason the staff of the Friday
edition of the Ring-tum Phi feels that it is
necessary to speak out on the issue of student
election. In the past few years the Ring-tum
Phi has avoided taking this step. We believe
that this unspoken policy is a mistake. Too
often the newspaper has avoided this and
other questions in an attempt to stay out of
controversy; the fact is that it is the duty and
responsibility of this newspaper to evaluate
the candidates in this or any election and
present our opinions on them.

With this in mind, the staff of this news-
paper was polled individually on the upcom-
ing election. The opinion presented in this
editorial is that expressed by an overwehelm-
ing majority of staff members. It is not the
opinion of its author alone, nor of any other
single person on the Friday edition.

ae % Bd

The Friday Ring-tum Phi believes Swede
Henberg is the more suitable candidate for
student body president. Although both Mr.
Henberg and his opponent Mr. Honig have
excellent qualifications for this office, several
other considerations combine to make Mr.
Henberg more desirable in our eyes.

Chief among these factors is Mr. Hen-
berg’s experience with the Curriculum Com-
mittee. As chairman of that committee he
has done much to further the cause of cur-
riculum reform. Certainly one of the most
crucial issues to come up next year will be
changes in the curriculum, especially if the
faculty adopts a short-term plan. Mr. Hen-
berg’s unique experience gives him except-

ars

ional qualifications to deal effectively with
this issue.

Specifically, Mr. Henberg proposes in his
platform a definite plan to ensure further stu-
dent participation in curriculum changes.
Another proposal is for the setting up of in-
terdepartmental seminars. As he points out,
‘Tt’s time we stopped compartmentalizing
knowledge.”

This indicates another point in Mr. Hen-
berg’s favor: in place of the customary broad
(and meaningless) platitudes expressed in
most platforms, he formularizes concrete plans
of action. Mr. Henberg doesn’t at all speak
in the “we’ve-got-to-do-something-about-this
(but I don’t know what) manner” so com-
mon among candidates for any office.

Nor do all of Mr. Henberg’s plans deal
with the curriculum. A study of other parts of
his platform reveals how he plans for student
participation in the admission department and
in the admissions procedure in order to pro-
duce a more well-rounded student body. It
also indicates his concern for the quality of
student life. These are two issues which now
confront Washington and Lee.

Another factor to be considered is that
of the time element. Mr. Henberg’s opponent
plans to serve as president of his social fra-
ternity and chairman of CONTACT next
year. As Sam Hinkle would doubtlessly
testify, to organize the annual CONTACT
symposium successfully a great amount of
time and effort is required. Coupling this with
the duties of a fraternity president and student
body president put a heavy burden on any-
one—we feel, a too heavy burden. It is only
fair to the students that their president be
able to devote his time solely to their interests
without compromising them with other re-
sponsibilities. Mr. Henberg will be more able
to devote his time fully to his affairs as stu-
dent body president.

We believe it is imperative to emphasize
that we are coming out in favor of a candidate
and not in opposition of a candidate. We have
solely looked at issues in reaching our de-
cision. We also feel that it is an important
duty of this newspaper to face this issue in
its editorial column so that these columns can
fulfill their rightful function, that of assisting
students to form intelligent and objective
opinions.

freedom. | think that Washington
and Lee must compete and these
proposals are a step in the right
direction. In the same light, the in-

ually become a part of education at

Socially, the relaxation of regula

There is more
than one way of
of dealing with
any given __ issue,
and unfortunately
a campaign ranks
among the least effective modes of
operation, Obviously some issues are
raised when persons run for office,
but to my way of thinking, pointing
out a need is too often an end in
itself, an end which supplants the
necessity for hard work.

To illustrate I will use the pro-
posed curriculum reform as an ex-
ample. When the student body voted
on Thursday, these reforms constitut-
ed an “issue.” This is rightly so, but
the fact remains that work on the
curriculum has been in progress for
nearly two years. Obviously, then,
long before this current election the
curriculum was an “issue” to some-
one, specificallly the Curriculum
Committee.

Thus I think to be qualified for
any Executive Committee office, a
candidate should have proven before-
hand his competence in working re-
sponsibly during those long spells both
preceding and folowing the raising
of something as an “issue.” I hope
my work on the Curriculum Com-
mittee for the past two years will
serve to indicate my concern for con-

year, | believe | have made clear
where I stand; opinions intact, let me
tell you what I want to do about
them: realistically, with an eye to
the needs of both the moment and
the future.

First, let me say that the Presi-
dent’s job is a multi-faceted one.
He cannot concern himself with only
one issue to the expense of all others.
Second, let me say that I am familiar
with the rules and procedures by
which the Executive Committee op-
erates, having attended all but two
of its meetings this year.

Now here's my program,

Yes, courses and degrees are im-
portant. We all agree on this, and
we all are looking forward to changes
in this area; but we will know, within
a month, if the faculty will grant
these changes. After that, what? What

structive programs in the Washing-
ton and Lee community.

But for the future, I will first list
those items which I feel need specific
attention in the curriculum:

1. If some sort of short term ar-
rangement passes the faculty, | think
it is clear that enormous revisions
will be made in all course offerings.
It will be a good time for updating,
innovating and expanding. Each de-
partment will probably decide on
certain new requirements and new
courses. To insure that these changes
are not undertaken without student
advice, I propose either modifying the
present Student Curriculum Commit-
tee’s duties to include this advisory
capacity; or, perhaps even better, I
propose urging the departments to
select their own committees of two
or three majors to research student
opinion.

2. The Curriculum Committee this
year suggested to the Political Science
Department a revision of the format
for their introductory course. This
mostly entailed a method of divid-
ing the teaching load so as to limit
emphasis on one specialized branch
of political science. Chances are the
department will test this suggestion
with an experimental section next
year, This format should be looked
into for possible application in other

 

areas.

will be done next year?

I suggest elimination of cut restrict-
ions before and after holidays. This
is but one step but it is a step
forward. As well, we should concern
ourselves with the tangible: washing
machines under the dorm for use by
all students; better parking facilties
using the ungraded, near-campus
areas owned by the University; re-
institution of the second-hand text-
book sales by the Student Library
Committee. These are more steps
forward.

We must concern ourselves with all
people on this campus. Columbia
and Harvard, among a majority of
other law schools, are instituting the
J.D. degree in place of the LL.B.
Why not at Washington and Lee?
This would be another step forward.

We speak of student apathy. I
suggest a self-study by the student
government here of all our student
institutions for the purpose of dis-
covering whether or not these institu-
tions themselves are obsolete. Perhaps
it is the root of student apathy, a
feeling that people who become in-
volved are not effective in their in-
volvement.

3.  Interdepartmental — seminars
should be set up, particularly among
such diverse fields as science, social
science and humanities. It’s time we
stop compartmentalizing knowledge
and recognize that analogous assump-
tions run through all disciplines,

Outside the curriculum [I would
work toward:

1, Setting up an informal program
of student participation in the ad-
missions department. This will in-
clude working for a student on the
admissions committee. My feeling is
that W&L must, under today’s com-
petition, actively sell itself rather
than sit back and wait for reputa-
tion to work wonders. If sufficient ad-
missions staff cannot work full time
to visit all high schools in a large
Southern metropolis such as Atlanta,
then the possibility of student aid
should be considered.

2. Centralizing of such diverse
items as the free forum and poetry
readings in Payne Hall and the new
student center. Along this line, |
would push for a coffee house ar-
rangement (on Sunday perhaps) featur-
ing a variety of entertainment—any-
thing from one man art shows to
folk singing. I would also check
into the possibility of showing weekly
or bi-weekly movies at the student
center,

already taken forward. | am willing
to roll up my sleeves to make sure
this progress continues.

Further, I have the capacity to
serve as your President. Next year,

be a dormitory counselor again, Jay

you on these bases without intend-
ing to back them up. The Student
Body Presidency is not an office
which exists for the prestige of its
holder but rather for the promotion
of the interests of the students.

I seek to establish a vigorous ad-
ministration. Join me.

the school as a whole. I have been in-
volved in the vital issues which have
confronted this campus during this
time. Now I relish the thought of
being able to use the experience
which | have gained by serving as
your vice-president. I feel that my
experience will be helpful not only
in dealing with student matters, but
more importantly in administering

For Vice President

Our campus is indeed fortunate to
have so many well-respected and
worthwhile traditions. However, we
are now in the crucial process of
questioning the reasoning behind
many traditions, In a sense, ours is
a new age of rationalism. If we are
to remain in contact with modern
society we must be willing to make
changes. However, a change which
requires the destruction of long-held
ideals and promises no replacement
or improvement of the status quo
is meaningless and potentially dang-
erous, In short, | am saying that we
are facing a period of decision-mak-
ing and value judgments which will
have far-reaching effects. The issues
which will be raised will deserve the
attention of every student,

 

There are many issues now pend-

 

For Fancy ‘Dress President

Tompkins Looks at Job

ing and it is not possible to discuss
them all. Several issues seem to have
special importance. Specifically, I feel
that the investigation of the Co-op
should continue with special attention.
Also, | feel that our involvement in
the Virginia Association of Student
Governments (VASG) should be re-
evaluated. Thirdly, it is my opinion
that we should have student repre-
sentatives on all faculty committees
that deal with student affairs. We
should take full advantage of our
representation on the Board of Trus-
tees. These and many other issues
deserve our close attention and as
your vice-president | promise that |
will do my best to see that these
issues are dealt with responsibly and
in the best interest of the university.
I ask your cooperation.

Bass Evaluates Fancy Dress

(Editor's Note: Chris Coursen,
the other candidate for Fancy
Dress President was asked to write
an article expressing his views on
Fancy Dress, but had not complied
by press time).

By MARTY BASS

A campaign for elected office is a
testing ground for issues, but | am
hard pressed to locate issues in an
election for a Dance Set office. In-
stead of issues, it becomes a question
of plans and ideas. In preparing a
platform, | will consequently be pre-

 

senting to the student body a slate

 

of suggestions which | hope to use
in planning Fancy Dress, 1970

1. Traditionally, Fancy Dress has
been an all-University weekend, Un-
like Openings, Springs and Finals, it
has not been identified with any one
class. With this tradition in mind,
1 would like to see the addition of
students from each class to the roster
of Vice-Presidenis, thus providing
each class with a representative in the
planning of the weekend. This is a
format whin has not been used
previously

 

2. | would like to see Fancy Dress |

returned to the status of a theme
party weekend, | have at the present
time several ideas which would in-
corporate the cocktail party, concert,
and ball into one theme.

3. | would like to survey the
student body through the use of polls
to determine their feelings and prefer-
ences for the type of entertainment
during the weekend, These surveys,
similar to the Annual Dance Board
Poll, would indicate the students’
preference as to type of music and
attire for the ball. Each year, some

“Black Voice” Appeals

For Understanding

By WALT JACKSON

“The Black Voice” spoke to white
Lexington last weekend in a dramatic
appeal for racial understanding. Lex-
ington High School’s Student Organi-
zation for Black Unity (SOBU) pre-
sented the program of Negro culture
at the Troubadour Theatre.

Produced without adult supervision,
the program used music, poetry,
dance, and dramatic readings to ex-
press the frustration of black teen-
agers. In an_ introduction, Joyce
Smothers explained the purpose:

“This is our way of protesting our
lack of participation in the com-
munity, not only in the government,
but also in jobs. We want to be given
a chance to be better. If you do
not want bitter hatred between our
groups, then help us: listen and under-
stand,”

The themes ranged from freedom
songs to scores from the musical
“Hair,” reflecting varying degrees of
alienation. But the prevailing image
was one of dignity coupled with
growing impatience. The message,
though candid, lacked the nihilism of
the urban gheto.

Ihe students read some of their
own poetry, which was intensely per-
sonal and gave an uncommon insight
into the thinking of black people. “A
Boy and His God” by Isca Mack
described the simple faith of a
Negro child and his subsequent dis-
illusionment when he discovers the
reality of “the system.”

Perhaps the most moving perform-
ance was by Charlene Spraggin, who
sang a folk song she had written, It
was a quiet, plaintive prayer for
racial peace, done much in the style
of Joan Baez.

There was no display of anti-white
sentiment, and the one or two al-
tempts at “Burn, baby, burn” rhetoric

le Me Ma Me Me Bn Ma Min tha te te dle ta de se a ta Bee dn lta a ta Ba he Ba lta dia a Bn Ba Ba Ba Ba Bn he

2 dramatic monologues came off
rather inconvincingly. They seemed
factitious and trite, resorting to such
emotional refrains as “My baby was
bitten by a rat.”

Patricia Scott, director of the pro-
gram, explained that it had the dual
function of enhancing the students’
self-confiedence through artistic ex-
pression and making the white com-
munity aware of the talents of blacks.
SOBU, she continued, also has sought
to develop Negro pride by requesting
a black studies course at Lexington
High. The School Board recently
agreed to include it in the curriculum
for next year.

Black students are encouraged to
bring their problems to SOBU, which
then discusses these problems with
the administraion or the teachers in-
volved. According to student Charlene
Scott, quite a number of teachers

have reacted sympathetically and have
shown increased interest in Negro
pupils.

SOBU was founded in February
with help from Liz Cone, a white
VISTA worker, and Randolph Hall,
a militant activist who graduated
from Lexington High and attended
Tuskeegee College. It is now mostly
a student-directed organization of
about 30 Negroes at Lexington High.
The group plans to work in the up-
coming City Council campaign and
hopes to stage a program on the
history of Negro dance from slavery
to the present.

How Students May Aid Poor

Working with the poor has become
a part of the educational experience
of a growing number of Washington
and Lee students. Several programs
in the community offer the chal-
lenge of confronting the problems of
economically disadvantaged people
beyond a perfunctory Christmas bas-
ket for a needy family.

The Young Republicans announc-
ed this week a project to provide
transportation for the federally-fund-
ed Total Action Against Poverty
(TAP) agency. TAP director Harris
Greene explained that in a rural
community it is difficult for the poor
to get to health clincs, government
offices, and community action meet-
ings. Students with cars are asked to
volunteer as drivers.

Sheets will be posted in the book-
store and in fraternity houses which
people can sign indicating the after-
noons on which they might be able
to drive. Volunteering does not obli-
gate one to anything. Mike Alderdice
may be contacted for further details
(463-4579).

History instructor Paul K. Beebee
recently began a tutoring service at
Lylburn Downing Junior High which
has attracted about 30 students. Mr.
Beebee’s wife teaches the sixth grade
at the school, and the program in-
volves some of her pupils, Tutors
from W&L spend one or two after-
noons a week coaching the children
in all subjects. More tutors could be
used in the project.

The Rockbridge Community Chil-
dren’s Center, located in the basement
of R. E. Lee Memorial
Church, provides day care for about
40 children from 3 to 6 years old.
The center is associated with TAP.

Mrs. Scarict Hoffman, director,
especially needs someone to work
with the youngsters in art and music.
Other areas in which college stu-
dents can help are physical educa-
tion, story-telling, and natural science.
The most valuable time is 9:00 to
10:30 a.m., although volunteers can
also be used in the afternoons. The
schedule is flexible and volunteers
may work on different days each

week,

Mrs. Hoffman emphasized that
many of the children are from fami-
lies in which there is no father. Since
the teachers at the Day Care Center
are all women, Washington and Lee
students could provide a male role
for the children to identify with.

W&L has been prominently involv-
ed with the Lexington Boys’ Club.
Coach Verne Canfield serves on the
Board of Directors and law student
Ted Feinour oversees the daily opera-
tion of the club. The University
recently financed the renovation of
the club house (one Rt. 11 near
VM)D), providing new equipment and
donating books for the a library.

About 20 to 25 youngsters, aged
7 to 18, regularly participated in the
club activities. Most are from very
poor families. Recreation activities
include crafts, ping-pong, pool, and
teherball. The boys had a basketball
team in the winter and hope to
field a baseball team.

The club is open from 3:00 to 7:00
p.m. Monday through Friday and
from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday. Feinour said anyone is
welcome to come by the club house
any afternoon. Students may wish to
set aside one afternoon a week to
help. W&L Young Republicans are
recruting workers to help on a weekly
basis.

No special skills are required for
this type of work, Feinour explaned.
He feels it is helpful just for the
students to talk with the boys and

to play games with them. “Although
the boys may occasionally seem
resentful or indifferent, I think they
basically look up to guys from Wash-
ington and Lee,” he observed.

Feinour belives the main success
of the Boys’ Club has been in giv-
ing the members an opportunity to
develop self-confiedence through par-
ticipation. Although he makes a rather
conservative estimate of the club's
effectivness, he notes that it has been
rewarding to him to see a dropout
return to school and do well after
becoming involved with the club.

Dr. Emory Kimbrough, chairman
of the Sociology Department, states
that he wants to make the resources
of the department available to the
community as much as possible. He
invites studnets interested in com-
munity affairs to contact him about
any project. Dr. Kimbrough says
there is a good chance that within
two or three years Washington and
Lee will have an Upward Bound
program. Under this federal program,
college tutors would attempt to pro-
vide educational and cultural enrich-
ment for disadvantaged high school
and junior high students.

Mike Neer and John Glace gave W&L

Bill Kahn had another good day,

well with a second in the the pole
vault and thirds in the long jump and
triple jump. Deaton and Williams
added to their laurels by finishing
first and third in the discus.

Ihe running events was another
story as the Maroons took every

Golfers Split;
Rain Hurts Play

Last Friday the Washington and
Lee golf team continued its win-
ning ways by downing the Hampden-
Sydney Tigers at the Boonsburg
Country Club in) Lynchburg, Va.
Captain Gary Silverfield said that four
of the six golfers won their matches
to give the Generals the win, 6-3,

In last Tuesday’s match against
Old Dominion and Roanoke, the
rain put a “damper” on things. The
course was very wet and Captain
Gary Silverfield said that the condi-
tions were worse than in any match
he’s ever played here.

As a result of the weather, the
Generals did not do as well as
they had expected. Old Dominion
edged the Generals by a 3%-
2% score, while W&L beat Roa-
noke by a score of 54%4-%. Low score
for the match was 73 by Jim Lee of
Old Dominion. Low for the Generals
was Bob Matthews with a 77.

Other individual performances for

W&L are as follows. Ken Carter
with a 78 beat Roanoke and lost to
Old Dominion. Dick Singletary won
both of his matches. Bill MacCleod
won both his matches with a 79. Gary
Silverfield beat Roanoke and tied!
Old Dominion with a 79, Bob Mat-
thews tied Roanoke and lost to Old
Dominion, and Jim Gordon beat Roa-
noke and lost to Old Dominion. Coach
Twombly said that it was a close
match, but we should have won.

The Generals next match will be
Friday, April 25th at 1:00 p.m, at)
the Lexington Golf Club. Their op- |
ponents will be William and Mary |

 

Stickmen Lose;

B-Sq it
uad Splits

In last Saturday’s action the W&L
lacrosse team was turned back by
a strong North Carolina ten by a
score of 12-6, to suffer its second
loss in South Atalantic Division play.

Despite the score W&L put in a
fine showing. Changes were made in
the offense, the new extra-man offense
proving effective. Fast breaks and un-
settled situations hurt the Generals,
as did their lack of depth, Penalties
also hurt, especially co-captain Char-
lie Stewart who was guarding All-
America attackman Peterson, who
scored four goals and had two assists.

Scorers for W&L were Freshman
Scott Neese who had three goals.
Whitney Morrill had a pair of goals,
with Bart Goodwin rounding out the

scoring. On defense freshman Tom
Smith, from Annapolis, Md. drew
strong praise from Coach Dick
Szlasa.

This weekend the stickmen travel
to Western Maryland College and the
University of Baltimore for a pair of
games, and will return on Sunday.

LACROSSE B-SQUAD

In “B”-squad action last week the
baby Generals beat AMA by a score
of 6-5. Yesterday, however, they took
a beating at the hand of St. Chris-
topher’s, 13-2. St. Cristopher's was
led by high school All-America
Chooch Turner, who had four goals
and four assists. St. Christopher's
jumped out to a 10-0 lead at the
half, with the second half appearing
a closely matched game, as W&L
held them to three goals while scor-
ing two.

Music Groups Seatined

The coming week at Washington
and Lee offers a full agenda for those
interested in music.

The Brass Choir is going to Hollins
to perform and in exchange for
this the Hollins College Music De-
partment is offering a program here.
The program will be Tuesday night
at 8:00 p.m. in Lee Chapel.

Next week is also the time of the
annual visit of the National Sym-
phony from Washington.
