Innovative

Theatre Plan
Is Disclosed

By LAWRENCE McCONNELL

Who would expect to find hard
rock music and strobe lights used to
accentuate the actions of masked
actors in an adapted Greek tragedy?
Perhaps you might expect it at a
Yale Drama School production, but
certainly not at such an austere insti-
tution as Washington and Lee.

This sort of experimentation § in
theatre is not the only trick Professor
Lee Kahn has up his magician’s sleeve,
for, next semester, Mr. Kahn plans
to launch an acting company. The
purpose of the group will be to as-
semble all students seriously interest-
ed in acting and have them work
as a group under the direction of
actors and directors from theatres
around the country

In commenting about his
idea, Mr. Kahn remarked, “I
that the idea of the company
best way to get the most out of an
individual, You're bound to get a
better results because the actor has
a chance to work consciously on his
own style, rather than on one par-
ticular part in a_ production.”

he first instructor for the company
will be Evelyn Hendrickson, an
actress from New Orleans who has
been associated with drama at Tulane
University for many years. Accord-
ing to Mr. Kahn, she has in
several movies, appeared
vision shows, and has worked
community and university theatre
well. Her husband also happens to be
the head of the drama department at
Tulane. Mr. Kahn is unsure about who
else would to work with the
company, but he said, “There will
definitely be at least one more per-
son this year.

“| hope that Mrs. Hendrickson will
be working largely with style move-

Although she'll only be here two}
weeks or so, those people that are |
interested ought to get a lot ac-

complished.”

Sound ambitious? At first glance,
perhaps. But anyone who has seen
a Troubadour production in the past
few years can't be too skeptical about |
its outcome.

game,

This was the first time W&L tackled
Navy since 1936, when they also
emerged as winners,

Ihe contest was tied at 29-29 with
1:17 left in the first half when Mel
Cartwright, Bill Rhyne, and Charlie
Stone added seven points to put the
Blue in the lead for good. In the last
seven seconds Stone drove up to the

cut it down to six. Six seconds before
the final buzzer it was 69-67. A foul

collecting a total of 29 poinis. He

W&L 83-75 in the Doremus Gym
Tuesday night. The Generals hit only
24 per cent during the first half,
while the Florida team made 70 per

half, 42-24, reflected that difference.

WAL scored 51 points in the sec-
ond half to 41 for Florida Presby-
terian, but it was not enough to make
up the difference. The opponent’s |

get any closer,

Cartwright led the Generals’ scor-
ing effort with 19 points, and Neer

figures, making 13 and 12 points re-
spectively.

After a three-week lay-off for
exams, the Generals will resume
action on the court February 5 with
a home game against Roanoke Col-
lege. They will go into that contest
with a 12-3 record, having lost only
Baltimore, and

to Randolph-Macon,

Flush for Freedom

fo the Editor:

Ihe Students for Violent
Action (SVNA) is planning a massive
demonstration in protest of the exist-
ence of the new administraion. On
January 20, 1969, as Nixon says the
last word of the inaugural oath !",..
so help me God.”), we plan to have
every toilet in the country flushed.

We realize of course that we may
not be able to reach every toilet, but
we hope that, with the cooperation
of organizations such as yours, we
shall be able to reach a large majority
of them. We are attempting to enlist
the aid of students at every college
and university in the nation as well
as anyone else who wishes to join.
The protest will require a high de-

Non-

 

gree of organization effort as we hope
to flush the toilets not only of the!
dorms, apartments, and lecture halls,
in and around the campuses, but also |
downtown hotels, restaurants, railroad
and high schools, private
homes, ete.

With you rhelp in promoting this

stations,

project, FLUSH FOR FREEDOM
will be a success.

College Geeks
Hit By Draft

By ROGER MUNSICK

The Washington Post, in its No-
vember 26 edition, has cited a marked
increase in the number of college
graduates in the Vietnam wartime
army, and has designated the condi-
tions of the present draft system as
the primary reason for the upswing.

The Post discussion estimates that
Spring of the upcoming year will
find between 25 and 30 percent of
all draftees to be college graduates.

| By comparision, the draft of October,

1968, found only 20 percent of those
drafted in this category and the total
in the spring of this year was only
about five percent.

Much of this increase is due to
legislation passed in 1967, says the
Post, making the drafted graduate
student eligible for duty at the con-
clusion of the semester during which
he is called, rather than at the end
of his complete matriculation.

Draft repetitions at eighteen month
intervals, coupled with the year-long
current tour of duty in Vietnam, are
another fundamental factor in the
armed forces growing “intellectual-
ism.”

While speculation rages concerning
draft inequities, and new-found strains
on graduate schools, the question re-
mains as to the effect of a large
number of college men entering the
armed forces. When interviewed, sev-
eral former combat leaders in Viet-
nam praised the capabilities of the
individual college graduates in the
field. They cited responsibility and
the confidence placed in such men by
their superiors as prime reasons for
their opinions. Indeed, one such vet-
eran even went so far as to term
combat college graduates that he had
commanded as “damn good soldiers.”

W&L Role Key
In Amendments
To Constitution |

Washington and Lee University
graduates and students played key
roles in the proposed Constitutional
Revisions announced last week.

[Two members of the 1t1l-member |
commission are Washington and Lee |
alumni: Lewis F. Powell Jr., a mem-!
ber of the W&L board of trustees, |
former president of the American Bar
Association and president of the
State Board of Education; and Judge
Alexander M. Harman Jr. of Pu-
laski, former chairman of the State
Board of Elections.

Three of the seven lawyers who
served as counsel to the commission
are also University alumni: Andrew
W. McThenia, assistant professor of
law at W&L: and two Richmond at-
torneys, John F, Kay Jr. and
Hullihen W. Moore.

McThenia served as counsel to the
committees drafting revisions to
Article 5 of the Constitution, per-
taining to the office of governor and
the executive powers of the state
government: and Articles 10, 11 and
12, which deal with corporations and
the State Corporation Commission.

Two recent graduates of the Wash-
ington and Lee Law School and a
current student served as research as-
sistants to MceThenia, researching legal
questions and preparing memoranda

Offices Filled
In YR Election

In a special election Tuesday night,
Young Republicans named Steve Fin-
ley second vice chairman and Bruce

/ MacQueen recording secretary. Both
positions had been vacated through
| resignations,

Finley, a freshman, defeated junior

| Charles Whipple. MacQueen was un-
opposed,

The club passed a resolution pro-

| posed by Pat Arey urging Linwood
| Holton to become a candidate for

;Governor of Virginia. A Roanoke
lawyer, Holton was the Republican
gubernatorial nominee in 1965. He

is considered a likely candidate for
the governorship this year or for
appointment to a federal judgeship.

Ihe YR’s also approved a resolu-
tion offered by Jim Lawson stating
that the club should take positions
on campus issues. The previous policy
was to avoid controversies not related
to national politics.

YR President Hank Graddy won
the endorsement of the club as a
candidate for Region HI chairman.
Graddy, a Kentuckian, claims ex-
tensive support from his home state.
The region also includes Maryland
and the District of Columbia. The
chairman will be elected at the Region
Ill convention in Louisville, March
8-9,

Now a first lieutenant in the
Marines, Apgar is due to return from
Viet Nam in May. After his release
from the Marine Corps in 1970 he
hopes to pursue a career as a political
cartoonist.

The exhibit, at the duPont Art Gal-
lery, will continue through Feb. 8.
