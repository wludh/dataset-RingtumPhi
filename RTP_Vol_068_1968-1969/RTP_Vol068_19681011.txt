Next Tuesday afternoon, Oct. 15,
the Executive Committee of the Stu-

orientation assembly here for juniors

The program, to be held in con-

by the Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments in cooperation with
Virginia educators. It is “designed to

encourage these students to realize

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tum Phi

We are very disappointed in the Executive
Committee.

At Tuesday’s meeting the EC voted down
Steve Sandler’s motion to support the Inter-
fraternity Council, which urged all girls to
patronize those lodging home that would
be willing to take in Negroes. Sandler’s motion
also asked the EC to help the IFC compile
a list of these houses and publish and ad-
vertise this list in Lexington and at the sur-
rounding girls’ scools.

By rejecting this motion, the EC, which
is the voice of the student body, has approved
of the situation as it now exists. In effect,
the EC’s decision states that W&L favors
discrimination and is not in favor of chang-
ing housing policies.

The EC has chosen to ignore the fact
that problem exists. Certain members of
the EC feel that since there is adequate hous-
ing for the Negro students now at W&L
everything is all right. This shows narrow-
minded reasoning. Wherever discrimination

Friday, October 11, 1968

We Are Disappointed In The EC

is involved, there is a problem. Whenever a
person cannot stay in a place of public lodg-
ing because of his color, there is a definite
problem. It is a fact that a problem cannot
be solved by ignoring it. It will not be cor-
rected until something concrete is done.

For the above reason we commend the
IFC. They see that a problem exists and they
are willing to stick their necks out to do some-
thing about it. Even if this is just a token of
action on the part of the IFC, as many
people have claimed, at least this is a step in
the right direction.

The IFC will now have to act without the
support of the EC in this endeavor, but it
does not need this support. It brought the
issue out into the open without the EC’s aid
and made both the student body and the
women who run the lodging homes conscious
of the situation. We are confident the IFC, as
the spokesman for all the fraternities and their
members, will not need the EC’s help in ac-
complishing its goal.

 

Yet Another Five-Day Plan

In spite of the Executive Committee’s
blunder on the above issue, this body ap-
proved what we believe to be the best plan
we have seen for a five-day week schedule.

Last week we stated that Plan A would be
the best for W&L of the five formulated by
the faculty committee. However, we did not
realize that the faculty could consider any
plan it wanted to in addition to the ones
presented to it by the faculty committee. This
is fortunate, for now the wishes of the stu-
dents can now be heard.

The plan approved by the EC is the
Ring-tum Phi plan. Classes would meet for

hours A,C,E,G,I or B,D,F,H,J. The major
alteration is that classes would meet one week

on MWFE and the following week on TT.

The advantages to this program are that
there are no scheduled afternoon classes; no
change in examination schedules; five minutes
between classes; no increase in the school
year; and no red tape to keep this plan from
going into effect next semester.

The disadvantages to this plan are that
the school day is increased by one-half hour;
lunch is shortened by 15 minutes; and stu-
dents and faculty members will lose 25 minutes

The Lodging Issue
Dear Editor:
With reference to the Times Dis-
patch article of October 5 (a copy
of which is enclosed), may I say that
my black brothers and sisters and I
here at Virginia State appreciated the
position that the Ring-tum Phi has
taken on the issue of lodging in the
Washington and Lee area.

If your efforts are sincere, then 1
challenge you to stand with us through
light and darkness until the problems
of racism and segregation cease to be.

Again, I thank you,

For black and white together,
Charles L. Farrar

Senior, Accounting major
Virginia State College

 

 

Congratulations, EC!

To the Editor of the Friday
Edition of the Ring-tum Phi:

My utmost congratulations to
Washington and Lee’s Executive Com-
mittee for having put the Interfra-
ternity Council in its place. Although
in past years the IFC has been suffi-
ciently passive to satisfy the restive
W&L student body, this group has all
of a sudden begun meddling in affairs
obviously not in the realm of this
academic community.

What right does a bunch of stu-
dents have to criticize the stolid and
staid FFVY women who have lived
in Lexington for centuries? These
women recognize the difference be-
tween black and white, and have
reacted in response to these dif-
ferences.

Thank Lee that our Executive
Committee has seen fit to protect
these women from the IFC’s sland-
erous attacks. The members of the
EC who so lucidly pointed out that
“we shouldn’t make any trouble” be-
cause “there really isn’t any problem”
deserve the thanks of the student
body.

In all good faith, I remain

Lexington ’s New Ordinance On Noise

The city of Lexington has enacted a new
ordinance condemning noise. If it is en-
forced Lexington will become the quietest
city in the world. Just think of all the rest
homes and hospitals that would like to settle
here then.

Permit us to quote some of this new ordi-
nance to you.

“The making and creation of loud, un-
necessary or unusual noises within the limits
of the City of Lexington is a condition which
has existed for some time . . .”

“Tt shall be unlawful for any person to
make, continue, or cause to be made or con-
tinued any loud, unnecessary or unusual noise
or any noise which either annoys, disturbs,
injures or endangers the comfort, repose,
health, peace or safety of others, within the
limits of the city.”

The following acts are declared to be
“loud, disturbing and unnecessary noises” in
violation of this ordinance:

“Horns, Signaling Devices, etc. The
sounding of any horn or a signaling device
on any automobile, motorcycle, or other ve-
hicle on any street or public place of the city,
except as a danger warning.”

“Radios, Phonographs, ete. The using,
operating, or permitting to be played, used
or operated any radio receiving set, musical
instrument, phonograph, or other machine

or device for the producing or reproducing of
sound in such manner as to disturb the peace,
quiet and comfort of the neighboring inhabi-
tants or at any time with louder volume than
is necessary for convenient hearing for the
person or persons who are in the room...
The operation of any such. .. between the
hours of eleven o'clock p.m. and seven o'clock
a.m. in such a manner as to be plainly audible
at a distance of fifty (50) feet from the build-
ing . . . shall be prima facie evidence of a
violation . . .”

“Animals, Birds, etc. The keeping of any
animal or bird which by causing frequent or
long continued noise shall disturb the com-
for or repose of any persons in the vicinity.”

“Exhausts. The discharge into the open
air of the exhaust of any stationary internal
combustion engine, or motor vehicle except
through a muffler . . .”

“Defect in Vehicle or Load. The use of
any automobile, motorcycle, or vehicle out of
repair, so loaded or in such manner as to
create loud and unnecessary grating, grinding,
rattling or other noise.”

These are the offenses. What are the
penalties? Any person who violates any pro-
vision of this ordinance shall be fined “not
exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment for
not more more than thirty (30) days, or by
both said fine and said imprisonment.”

A Response To Leonard

To the editor:

I would like to take issue with
Danny Leonard's report concerning
the Democratic National Convention
(Sept. 27th issue). I believe it ap-
propriate and necessary to offer a
voice of dissent to Mr. Leonard's
interpretation of the events that took
place in Chicago.

First of all, Mr. Leonard states
that “Humphrey's strategy for win-
ning the nomination depended on two
key figures: Richard M. Nixon and
Richard J. Daley.” He implies that
the candidacy of Nixon would help
Humphrey. If this is so, one wouldn't
know it from reading the newspapers
or looking at the polls. Mr. Leonard
says that Daley was really working
for Humphrey all along and never
had any interest in a Kennedy candi-
dacy. Yet Daley was known to be
strongly leaning to Robert Kennedy
before the latter's assassination.

Lafayette may be without its two
top running backs when it faces Wash-
ington and Lee Saturday.

Both tailback Bob Zimmers of Rill-
ton, Pa. and fullback Tom Triolo
of Sharon Hill, Pa. worked out in
| sweat clothes Monday at Lafayette’s
| practice. Zimmers suffered a thigh
injury and Triolo banged his knee in
Lafayette’s 7-0 victory over Hofstra
last Saturday.

Zimmers lead Lafayette in rushing
with 218 yards in 51 carries (a 4.3
average), punting with a 36.0 aver-
age and scoring with 18 points. Triolo
is next in rushing with 100 yards on
36 carries.
