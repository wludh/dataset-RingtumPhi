‘Let’s Look at Ourselves

Every week as I write editorials for this newspaper, I
find the need to be completely objective. That is, I cannot
let my emotions rule my thoughts. Whatever I say must be
backed by concrete evidence. Often, however, there are things
I want to get off my chest—things which bother me and are
very much a part of me. Such is the case this week, as I drop
all editorial decorum and relate to you my reactions toward
the speeches of the first three CONTACT speakers.

Each of these speakers had key sentences in his talk
which made me reflect on myself—my purpose, my goals, my
life, my education. The words I quote from Dr. Ralph Lapp,
a research physicist, came from his speech Wednesday night.
He said ‘‘Let’s look at the earth before we look at the moon;
let’s look at ourselves.” Phillippe Labro, a French newspaper
reporter, said Wednesday afternoon, “To act as an adult
has always posed problems, whereas obedience and conformity
never do.”’ The shortest, but probably most disturbing sentence
came from black militant Jack Thomas Tuesday night. He
said, “I distrust all whites.”’

I see each of these sentences as raising serious questions
and doubts for myself. First of all, if I look at myself, what do
I see? Do I see a Washington and Lee student trying to
play a role, or do I see myself as a part of society with certain
obligations to help others. Am I living my life the way I want
to or am I living my life the way others want me to? Am
I wasting my life, or am I making it worthwhile? Are there
times when I am so self-centered I cannot think about the
problems of others or do I always ignore the needs of others?

Questions aroused by Mr. Labro’s speech followed a similar
vein. Am I just contented to accept what others accept
(whether it is good or bad) just because it provides comfort?
Or am I willing to risk some of this comfort to strive for what
I feel is right? I see apathy all around me, but are all of
these people happy or are they bored to death like Frenchmen
before the May uprising? Do I suffer from a sense of useless-
ness or lack of understanding for world problems and other
people? Furthermore, as a student am I getting an education;
am I really learning about life or am I reading about life?

From remarks made by Jack Thomas, I believe that at
W&L I am just reading about life. Living within the Utopian-
like existence at W&L, I seem to have forgotten what life
is all about. It isn’t parties on weekends and classes on week-

days. It is more than that. It must be. Why else would a black |

man stand up in front of a white majority and say he distrusts
all whites? Why does he distrust whites? What have whites
done to warrant this mistrust? What can I do to try to gain
the black man’s trust? Am I a racist? Am I immoral in going

to a school in which the student body is in a position to help

blacks, and even whites, in need, but insists there is no prob-
lem? Since I am in a position to help, why don’t I?

These are not all of the questions I have asked myself.
Even these, however, may never be satisfactorily answered.
The point is that I am thinking and reflecting on myself. I
hope many students have been similarly moved. If this is the
case, then CONTACT can certainly be considered a success.

Independent Exam Schedul

The Friday Ring-tum Phi wishes to go on record as en-
dorsing the Executive Committee’s independent examination
proposal. An editorial on this subject would only repeat the
observations expressed by sophomore EC member Stamen
Ogilvie in a letter appearing on this page. We urge you to
read it.

Lovemaking at W&L?

The curriculum at W&L is now undergoing changes. An
editorial from the February 12 Richmond News Leader dis-
cusses a curriculum change at the University of South Carolina
in Columbia, which aims “at development of the whole per-
son.”

Under USC's new curriculum, students will have their
choice of 101 short courses on lovemaking, premarital sex and
bartending. These courses, involving no entrance fee, no
exams, no grades and no credit, are part of a new program
whereby students select their own courses, and teachers pick
out what they would like to teach

Fortunately courses suc h as these don't need to be taught

at W&L.

(Editor's Note: This is Bill Walk-
er’s final article in his series on
the Honor System's effectiveness.)

By BILL WALKER
First Year Law

The Honor System at Washington
and Lee is more than a set of moral
precepts; it is a legal system. Its
primary function is that of all legal
systems, to enforce compliance with
the rules. In our case, the rules are
neatly, if unrealistically, defined in
three prohibitions against lying, cheat-
ing, and stealing. There is no code,
no definition of offenses, and no
precedent. Likewise, there is no gradu-
ated system of punishment for en-
forcement. This absence of codifica-
tion and graduated punishment de-
prives our system of the essence of
the American legal tradition—justice.

There would be no need for a
code if the system operated as it is
so concisely stated, but it does not.
Although there is a_ prohibition
against lying, it has been judicially
announced that one is not criminally
liable for intentionally and notori-
ously misrepresenting his age to the
ABC personnel. The of
would take issue our
expedient ruling. Likewise, pro-
hibition against cheating quite
flexible enough for the student court

spite the prohibition on the card
against such practice. Even the
prohibition against theft falls short

ternity brother's liquor at a party.

Conflicting Interpretations

The problem obvious. Either
through ambiguity, or executive equi-
vocation, the three prohibitions are
subject to numerous conflicting in-
terpretations. The recent student body
honor trial made this fact quite clear.
S» we have a situation in which a
student’s own good faith interpreta
tion of one of the prohibitions may
by chance differ from that of the
honor court, and the result is con-
viction. | find it hard to believe that
the court possesses unique and
infallible ability to interpret the
ambiguities of the system better than
the ordinary student. I find it
difficult to define justice where one

who acts in good faith and with
honest intentions is convicted of dis-
honor

 

A codification of the honor system
is needed to remove the ambiguity.

a

 

Letters To The Ed

Each of the three basic prohibitions
should be clearly defined, so that
there can be no doubt in an indi-
vidual’s mind as to the limits of the
system. It is only logical where one’s
entire academic career depends on
his adherence to a particular system
that he be furnished with a clear
definition of that system. Justice
should never be allowed to rest on
mere chance.

The Absolute Penalty

It is strange that the one un-
ambiguous tenet of the system as it
presently exist is the greatest travesty
of justice. I refer to the absolute
penalty on determination of guilt.
The absolute penalty is part of the
traditional honor system at Washing-
ton and Lee, and like other aspects
of the system, it has survived the
death of the era and reasoning of
which it was a part. When our honor
system was ordained, about one hun-
drerd ago, the contemporary
concept of criminal punishment was
to remove the criminal from society,
to isolate him permanetnly so that
he might never again break the law.
The modern concept, on the other
hand, is that criminals should be
rehabilitated and reoriented so that
they might become assets to society.
Our absolute penalty totally disregards
this modern concept.

The only logical justification for
the absolute penalty in our system
would seem to be that once a man
commits a breach of honor, he is
forever dishonored, and never again
suitable for our respect. If this
the case, then Washington and
a university of thirteen
dishonorable men who are unfit to
be here. | dare say that there is
not among us one individual who
since reaching maturity has not in
any way compromised his own honor,
at least as honor is defined by our
system. Certainly each of us has at

being the case, is it not gross hypo-

| knows by that stage in the semester
} what courses will require most of
our study time. Of course, if an

 

emergency arises the Dean of Students
can still authorize a change in a man’s
Ischedule at any time. Let me em-
| phasize that this aspect of the pro-

pulsion except for the sanctimonious?
;Do we in any way improve our-
selves, or for that matter the guilty,
by the blind banishment? Certainly,
in some cases it is most just that
the offender be removed from our
midst. But can we honestly say that
this is the best result in every case?
I hardly think so.

In our modern legal system, the
legislature and the courts have de-
fined certain punishments commensu-
rate with various crimes. It is
recognized that some violations are
far less serious than others. | doubt
that there

are many among us,
even on the executive committee, who
would recommend that our courts

of law punish murderers and speeders
in the same manner. Such a course
of action would simply not be logical,
and in no way would it serve justice.
But here we readily accept the prin-
ciple of common punishment for
uncommon violations. For instance,
we punish the senior who copies ver-
batim a passage from a book and
represents it as his own in the same
way that we punish a frightened fresh-
man who panics on his first college
paper and uses the ideas of another
as his own. I can find no justice,
no equity, and certainly no reason
in such action. The seriousness of the
two violations is certainly not equal,
so why should the punishment be the
sume?
Stagnant System

The absolute penalty does injustice
not only to the individual who is con-
victed, but also to those of us who
remain so uprightly behind. Recently,
the Ring-tum Phi published a letter
allegedly written by a_ convicted
violator of the system. The author
claimed that he was a better man
for his conviction and dismissal, But
how will we ever know? Certainly
we would wish that the punishment
we mete out would make him a
better man, but if he never returns,
Wwe can never realize the extent of
success. We deny him the right
to return to our company and prove
that he is repented, and that he
has become a better and more valu-
able person for the experience. And
we ourselves might use one of the
finest potentials in the university be-
cause of one indecretion. So the
system stagnates, and without rein-
forcement it simply compounds the
injustice with each application.

I suggest that we should create

our

 

other modes of punishment, so that

r

  

 

 

posal is not a provision to placate
any faculty member who questions
your or my maturity. Rather it is

a means of self discipline whereby a!

Exam Schedule i"

The Honor System's Dishonor

the dispensation of each individual
case can truly be decided on the
merits. I would suggest that the
Executive Committee be given the

option of imposing one semester or
one year of suspension, after which
time the guilty party, is he so desired,
might return to Lexington to redeem
himself, to be given the opportunity
to prove that he is not now eternally
dishonorable. | think we would find
that we might learn a great deal
more about honor and courage than
we do in our present sanctimonious
little world. We might learn there is
a far more to honor than not getting
caught,

I do not mean to suggest that the
absolute penalty is never justified,
Certainly there are cases which show
such abandonment of honor that the
absolute penalty is only fitting and
proper. But not in every case, in every
set of circumstances which brings
one’s honor into question. I think that
most men deserve a second chance,
and that justice demands that they
be allowed that chance. I can imagine

few violations of the honor code
which are so inherently and _ ir-
revocably wrong that only eternal

exile will protect our university and
we ourselves.
Fear Is Cowardice

There are various arguments made
in favor of the absolute penalty. The
most prominent of these is that the
honor system is too important to
our good name. But is the name of
Washington and Lee worth more than
justice to our fellow man? Others
contend that without the absolute
penalty the honor system would lose
the aura of terror which they assert
make it work. But that which is done
or not done on the basis of fear of
retribution not honor, but rather
cowardice. And still asset is far

Is

outweighed by the deriment. Law
without justice is empty, without
meaning or purpose. One hundred

years of tradition will not justify even
a single act of injustice.

I would imagine that the absolute
penalty will continue to operate
it has for so long. Those who aren't
made to suffer by it just do not seem
to care about the injustice that is
done in their name. Until each of
us replaces indifference with reason
and compassion, and values justice
more than sanctimony, the blindness
of our honor system will continue to
dishonor us.

Neer Leads Charge Over Marines

By MIKE HOSFORD

After Tuesday night’s win over
Lynchburg College, the Generals did
not seem to let up a bit against the
Quantico Marines, at least for a
while. Storming out to a 16-0 lead,
the Generals seemed to be the only
team who knew which way the gym

was, The Marines appeared confused
and disorganized until the appearance
of Mike Redd on the court mid-way
through the first half. (Redd was a
Little All-America at Kentucky Wes-
leyan College and a recent draftee of
the Boston Celtics). At that point the
tide of the game seemed to take a

Good Guys Shoot ’Em Up

By MIKE HOSFORD

The rifle team seems to have
finally emerged from the realm of
the unknown and into the spotlight,
or in other words, “they done good,”
The previously unheard of, unherald-
ed group has come up with one of
the winning-est record of any sport
this year. We hear praise of the
basketball team’s 15-4 record, of the
swimming team’s 6-1 record, but who
ever knew the rifle team was riding
high with a 6-1 record?

Trying to compare this record with
any prior to 1965 is difficult because
the athletic department doesn’t even
have records before 1965. (Perhaps
this season will prompt them to keep
better records of the rifle team for
future reference). The growth since
1965 has been slow. The 1965-66 and
1966-67 teams did not win a match.
Last year’s team was still slightly on
the low side with a 3-7 record. This
year’s team is, however, different
in several respects other than it
successful record. First of all, most
of the consistent team shooters are
upperclassmen, which generally has
not been the case before. Second, the
team has a new coach, Sgt. White
of the ROTC department, who seems
to be a valuable asset to the team.
He replaced Sgt. Fields as coach this
year. We could make a few analogies

 

but we won't got that far. It will
suffice to say that the team has
significantly improved to the point
of receiving well deserved recognition
for its accomplishments. As one mem-
ber said, “We've moved out of
YMCA’s and into motels,” which
seems to show that the athletic de-
partment is taking a little greater
interest than in the past. At present
the university supplies guns and
equipment and provides lodging, etc.,
on trips away from school.

Below appears a_ schedule of
matches so far with scores. The
team’s only loss was suffered at the
trigger-happy fingers of a strong
Georgetown team in early December.
Since that time the Generals have
been undefeated, including two wins
last weekend against William and
Mary and the University of Rich-
mond, both of whom W&L had
beaten previously.

turn in the opposite direction as a
27-7 lead dwindled to 35-29 at the
half. In the last eight minutes of the
first half, the Marines outscored the
Generals 22-8. A spectacular 19 point
performances by Mike Redd in the
first half (considering he did not
even start!) seemed to be the dif-
ference. The Quantico defense gelled
towards the end of the half, and an
extremely hard press led to a num-
ber of W&L turnovers resulting in
buckets for the Marines. As a result
the Generals’ lead was cut to 35-29
at the half.

The second half seemed to reconcile
the two extremes of play found in
the first half. With 15 minutes left
the Marines pulled within two points,

45-43. They tied the game for the

first time with 9:40 left, 51-51. From}

there on out it was a see-saw battle,

Perhaps the one thing that saved
the Generals in the waning minutes
was Mike Redd’s fouling out with

tion for his spectacular 29 point per-
formance from the — gentlemanly
crowd. (It has been rumored by others

Stickmen Launch Early Attack |

Faced with a difficult regular sea- principal goal of the February pro-

son schedule, including the like of
Penn State, Washington College and
U.Va., Washington and Lee’s young
lacrosse team has already begun its
unofficial February practice sessions.
Helped by good weather and by the
use of facilities with which it has
never been provided before, the squad
is attempting to make the most of
the situation. The practices, run by
Coach Dick Szlasa and his assistants
John West and Jim Wynn, are aimed
at the goal of preparing the team
for a series of March scrimmages,
beginning March 8 against the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. Other scrim-
mages include one against Roanoke
March 15, Franklin and Marshall
March 18, and Dartmouth March 26.

Coach Szlasa has been pleased with
the turnout and effort displayed so
far. He encourages all those interest-

ed, even if they have not played
before, to come out now if they
wish to play varsity or “B” squad.

It is Szlasa’s hope that the practices | 7

will help to mature his young team
as rapidly as possible. Therefore the

gram is conditioning, in order that
the scrimmages can be
learning experiences, rather than be-
ing used to get the team in shape.

Despite a strong nucleus of return-
ing lettermen, the prospects of the
team depend to a great extent on
the speed with which some of the
freshmen and untested upperclassmen
develop. The defense, anchored by
goalie Pete Nowick and co-captain
Charley Stewart, is the area in which
competition is greatest. Returning
lettermen Ned Coslett, Tom Mullenix
and Bill Brumback are strong unit
but boys like Frank Stearns and
Bob Radcliffe, up from last year’s
“B” squad, and freshman Tommy
Smith are presenting a strong chal-

We're in the market for restless talent.
Your talent, if you'd enjoy helping us
continue a revolution we started some
years ago: changing the once-conser-
vative banking industry into a leading,
driving social force.

Today, the world of the modern New
York banker is one of innovation and
change. Of new concepts, new methods
and new ideas.

At Chemical Bank, in particular, you'll
find opportunity to make a contribu-
tion. Responsibility. Elbow-room for
rapid growth. Hard work, advancement
and reward commensurate with ability.
Right now, we're looking for young
people who want to live and work in the
New York metropolitan area, where
it’s happening most. Who are commit-
ted, and burn to help make decisions
that change the face of today’s world.
If you'd like to learn more about our
kind of revolution—and how you can
join us—set up an interview. Our men
will be on campus:
