Prohaska, Hall
Plan To Leave
For New Jobs

Two W&L fine arts instructors have
announced plans to leave the Uni-
versity at the end of this academic
year.

They are Raymond J, Prohaska, an
Instructor in Fine Arts and Artist-
In-Residence since 1964, and David
A. Hall, who has been an Instructor
in Fine arts and Artist-In-Residence
for the past year.

These announcements raise to three
the number of Fine Arts Department
members who have left the University
in the past two years. The first was
Sterling Boyd, who accepted an invita-
tion last spring to organize a Fine
Arts Department at Wake Forest.

Prohaska has decided to leave the
Lexington community to help Boyd
in his new task. He will assume his
new position next fall,

When asked the reasons for his
decision, Prohaska stated that Wake
Forest would offer a better market
for his artwork and better facilities
for his traveling needs. Also, Pro-
haska pointed out the fact that Wake
Forest offers him appropriations for
traveling expenses and would pay him
more for his efforts.

Prohaska also cited another point.
He stated, “Last year the University
issued a statement that no one could
work past the age of 70, and I am
nearing that age. | don’t have that)
problem at Wake Forest.”

Hall, a graduate of Amherst Col-
lege and a post-graduate of the Ohio
State College of Fine Arts, said that
he is looking for “some school which
will offer the most modern facilities”
in which to work “for both him and
his students.” He has been “unsatisfied
with the department at W&L  be-
cause of its seeming lack of ability
to modernize” and feels that his stu-
dents are “capable of doing much
more than they are now permitted.”

Also, Hall says that he will be
looking for a place which will per-

 

haps have a greater market for his
art. He presently has an exhibition at
duPont Hall but feels that for as
cheaply as he is selling his works,
he should be able to sell many more
than he has. He plans another exhibi- |
tion at Hollins College February 10
through March 6 “with hopes that
this one might be more profitable.”

When asked about his plans for
the future after leaving Washington
and Lee. Hall said he doesn’t know
yet, He has written several schools,
such as Valparaiso College. Witchita
Siate, and Bloomington, but has not
received any replies so far.

This year’s Fancy Dress will pro-
vide a new element for the W&L
dance scene, with psychedelic music
and a professional light show featur-
ed at the Saturday night concert.

The weekend will begin on Friday,
Jan. 31, with a formal ball Friday
evening at 9 in Evans Dining Hall.
This year the theme will honor new
President Huntley, as it is to be called
“An Inauguration Ball.” Les and
Larry Elgart and their band will pro-
vide music for the occasion.

On Saturday a cocktail party will
be held in Red Square from 4 p.m.
until 6 p.m. Willie T. and the Magnifi-
cents will play for the party at which
gain punch is to be served, as at
the previous cocktail party for Open-
ings Weekend.

The concert is scheduled for Satur-
day night. It will be held in Doremus
Gymnasium, beginning at 8 p.m.
Playing for the concert will be two
groups, the Kallabash Corporation
and the The Fever Tree. Lighting
will be provided by Pablo’s Environ-
mental Light Srow, the same company
which set up the light shows at New
York's Electric Circus. The theme of
the concert itself differs from that
of the weekend as a whole. It will
be “Love-In 69,” and for the con-
cert conventional dress will be
| abandoned and “appropriate” dress is
| .
| to be substituted.
| This year’s president of the Fancy
| Dress Weekend is Phi Delt Don
| Sharpe, who is assisted by 15 vice
| presidents, including Phi Delts Rick
McMillan, Hank Wilson, Bart Good-

 

 

ber of Delia Tau Delta, Phi Delta
Phi, Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta
Kappa and Order of the Coif.

Senior partner in the law firm of
Caskie, Frost, Davidson and Hobbs,
he was also active in business affairs
and civic work of Lynchburg.

In a statement issued upon the
death of Mr. Caskie, President Robert
E. R. Huntley commented:

“Word of Mr. Caskie’s death has
brought a deep sense of loss to his
many friends at Washington and Lee
... His unswerving loyalty and dedica-
tion will continue to stand as a grand
example for all of us here. His col-
| leagues on the Board of Trustees, his
friends on the campus, and the fel-

low alumni who knew him will rem-
| ber him with great affection and

Peter Vurnax, Evans Manager,

Has Been Relieved Of Position

By CHIP HARRIS

The news that Peter E. Vurnax has
been relieved as Manager of Evans
Dining Hall was announced _ this
afternoon by representatives of Slater
Food Service. Vurnax had been at
Evans Hall since November, 1967,
and was officially appointed its man-
ager last June,

The official explanation for the
action by Slater Food Service was
released by their district manager,
Mr. James Truttel. He said that
“Vurnax had failed to follow com-
pany policy and was not keeping up
on his reports and records.”

While all the facts concerning this
case were not clear at press time,
Vurnax’s dismissal has already raised
considerable dissatisfaction from both
the student body and athletic officials.

Jorge Estrada, a personal friend
of Vurnax and “a student interested
in the dining hall,” said “I feel that
there are three important things to
consider for a man in Mr. Vurnax’s
position. First, his attitude toward
the students is important; secondly,
his attitude towards his employees;
and thirdly, his attitude toward the
company he works for. His (Vurnax)
mistake seems to have been that he
put more emphasis on the first two.
As far as the students there has
never been a better manager than
Mr. Vurnax.”

Truttel pointed out that “ as both
a friend and the man who hired
Pete Vurnax, | am as disturbed as
anyone over his dismissal. However,

repeated warnings were issued by
Slater Foods to rectify the situation,
which he iignored.”

Several students claimed they were
informed, after Vurnax’s appointment,
that an assistant manager would be
forthcoming. The previous manager,
William Albright, had the services of
Vurnax as an assistant manager.

Several students interviewed indi-
cated that Vurnax was often hard
pressed to find either the time to
complete the paper work himself or
obtain adequate hel pto do it. While
one of the chefs proved valuable in
fulfiilling some of the magerial re-
sponsibilities, he neither had the time
no rthe training to assume al Ithe
functions of an assistant manager.

Game Broadcast

WLUR-FM radio (91.5 MC) will
carry live coverage of next Wednes-
day afternoon's basketball game from
Annapolis, Maryland, between Wash
ington and Lee and the Naval Aca-
demy. Mikey Philipps, University Di-
rector of Photography, will handle
the game's play-by-play, as he did
for all Generals’ road football games
last fall. He will be assisted by John
Wolf, who will be the color man
for the broadcast. Wolf, a senior, was
co-captain of the football team.

Tip-off time for the game is sched-
uled for 3:55 p.m., with the broad-

 

cast sign-on at 3:30.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Research Proves U.S. Mariyyuana Laws Too Strict

The subject of marijuana, cannabis,
“grass,” “pot’—whatever one may call it, is
now a topic of discussion on the Washington
and Lee campus. We have made a study con-
cerning this drug and wish to present our
results and conclusions to you at this time.

Our sources for this study are a New York
Times copyrighted article appearing in the
December 15, 1968 Richmond Times-Dis-
patch (headlined “Marijuana Study Finds
No Lasting Effects”); ‘Marihuana and So-
ciety,’ an article appearing in the June 24,
1968 Journal of the American Medical As-
sociation; an interview with Dr. R. Terrell
Wingfield, University psychiatrist, and various
other medical reprints.

The source of marijuana is the hemp plant
(cannabis), which has been used as an in-
toxicant for many ages in all parts of the
world. In dogs and monkeys small doses of
the components of cannabis have produced
complete anasthesia. However, studies on the
effects of cannabis on human beings are in-
complete. The most recent study has been
made by a team of Boston University re-

searchers. The team concluded that after
people smoke marijuana for an extended
length of time (not specified in the study),
they learn to ‘adapt to and overcome their
performance deficits.” On the other hand,
most of those who had never smoked mari-
juana before did not experience a “high.”
Instead “all experienced a small but significant
impairment of performance on simple tests,
ability to think clearly and motor coordina-
tion.”

A member of the study team noted that
after their subjects had smoked marijuana
they became more “‘present-oriented and talk-
ed more about their immediate surroundings
than about their past’? when they tried to
relate past experiences. They also could not
continue logical lines of thought.

In the end the team concluded that mari-
juana is harmless. “It’s not like alcohol, which
can seriously injure, even kill, you,” said one
of the researchers. ‘But I would not minimize
the effects of marijuana on brain function.”

For this reason, authorities like Dr. Wing-
field are somewhat skeptical about marijuana.

Honor

We learned two things about the honor
system in the December 17, 1968, Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi editorial. The first thing we
learned is that the “men of the EC are not
our peers;” the second thing we learned was
the “honor system’s strength on this campus
lies largely rooted in awe (or fear) of the
Executive Committee.”

To begin with the first point, we consider
the members of the Executive Committee as
our peers. They are our equals. It is true
that we have entrusted them with certain
responsibilities which may give them the title
of “leader,” but they are students just like
us. Their high position does not make them
infallible, especially in cases concerning the
question of honor. Sometimes it is possible
they may lose sight of this. Put yourselves in
their places and see how hard it is to be
totally objective when you suspect someone
is guilty of an honor violation. Your ques-
tions will undoubtedly be slanted and the
answers you receive will not be entirely in-
terpreted without bias.

This does not mean we think the Executive
Committee is failing to fulfill its purpose as
the enforcer of the honor system. But what it
does mean is that members of the EC, like
us, can make mistakes. As was stated in the
news story concerning the EC meeting De-
cember 16, “if you're innocent then you
don’t need to worry about a defense because,
according to several members of the EC, it
is nearly impossible to be convicted and be
innocent at the same time.” We are concerned
about the “nearly impossible” part.

The proposed amendments taken to the EC
for their consideration were efforts to ensure
due process for those students accused of
honor violations. At the same time, they were
intended to reduce any possibility of a mistake
on the BC's part. Admittedly, they may make
the EC’s decision on a person’s innocence or

 

System Rooted In Students

guilt a little harder, but why shouldn't a per-
son be given due process?

Anyone who believe he has not been treated
fairly (ie., given right of due process) in
being convicted by the EC will take his case to
a public honor trial. At this time, a student
jury will almost invariably acquit him. Public
honor trials which reverse EC decisions will
tend to hurt the honor system more by re-
ducing the faith students have in its enforcers.

With the above in mind, we strongly urge
the sub-committee studying the honor system
(Jay Passavant, Pete Hendricks, President
Huntley and Professor McThenia) to put in
writing the rights which every students should
have when he appears before the EC on an
honor violation.

The second point we learned from the
editorial was that the honor system’s strength
is a result of the fact that students fear the
EC. Admittedly, when a student appears be-
for the EC, he must be scared. In addition,
the ultimate penalty might be argued by some
to be a deterrent to honor violations. How-
ever, we believe the strength of the honor
system lies in the student body. The honor
system is either strengthened or weakened by
the students. The students realize that an
honor system run by them is the most advanta-
geous and the fairest system. Students them-
selves report other students who they suspect
are guilty of honor violations. Therefore, the
system is rooted in the students, not in fear.
The 12 members of the EC would have
nothing to uphold if the system were not
first upheld by the student body.

As for the question of fear of the EC, stu-
dent body president Jay Passavant is trying
to dispel this by publicizing the fact EC meet-
ings are open to everyone. He is trying to
dispel rumors of secrecy concerning EC busi-
ness. He wants the EC to communicate with
students and exchange ideas with them, This
is hardly a basis for fear.

 

He agrees with the Council on Mental Health
which states, ‘“The fact that no physical de-
pendence develops with cannabis does not
mean it is an innocuous drug. Many stimulants
are dangerous psychoactive substances al-
though they do not cause physical depend-
ence.”

Wingfield also commented on the argument
put forth by advocates for legalizing mari-
juana that it is less harmful than alcohol. He
said that the advocates were comparing rela-
tively small doses of marijuana with large doses
of alcohol. When we asked Dr. Wingfield
whether there may be any more physical or
psychical harm to “social” smokers (smoke
only on weekends) than there would be to
social drinkers, he could not provide an answer
because of a lack of research on the subject.

In his article on page three, “Peace” states
that the real crime is not the smoking of pot,
but the laws concerning it. Persons violating
the federal law pertaining to possession of
marijuana may be sentenced to two to 10 years
in prison for the first offense. The penalties
increase to five to 20 years for the second
offense and 10 to 40 years for additional
offenses. Only for the first offense are sus-
pensions of sentence, parole or probation al-
lowed. Penalties for selling marijuana are even
more severe.

Particularly unfair are the consequences if
a college student is convicted for possession of
marijuana. A conviction could ruin chances
for advancement after college graduation. In
many cases a prospective lawyer can be forbid-
den to become a member of the bar of his
state with such a conviction on his records.

A recent case in Prince George County
(Md.) shows the inequities of the laws con-
cerning marijuana. Eight young men were
sentenced to two years in prison for possession
of the drug. At the same time, the court sen-
tenced a youth to three years for possession of
opium, probably one of the most harmful
“hard” narcotics.

Dr. Wingfield and others agree that laws
concerning possession of marijuana should
not be as strict as they are now. Although
research is still incomplete, enough evidence
has been recorded to show that the laws con-
cerning marijuana are too harsh and unrealis-
tic for the danger of the drug. More emphasis
should be placed on rehabilitating rather than
punishing those psychologically dependent on
marijuana. Indeed, Dr. Wingfield sees more
potential danger for abuse with amphetamines
than with marijuana.

Amphetamines, known to students as diet
pills, “pep” pills and dexedrine, are useful
in treating epilepsy, mental retardation and

weight reduction. Dr. Wingfield speculates
that there are approximately 500 ampheta-
mine tablets manufactured per person in this
country per year. Somewhere between the
manufacturers and the druggists, many of
these pills are sidetracked and end up in the
hands of students. We asked Dr. Wingfield
why the government could not limit the
amounts of these amphetamines manufactur-
ed. He speculated that powerful lobbies in
Washington, D.C., prevented this.

In the Prince George case referred to previ-
ously, the penalty for possession of ampheta-
mines without prescription was imprisonment
for six months.

Users of marijuana also contend that leg-
alization of the drug may make it possible for
the government to keep a closer eye on its
distribution, strength and quality. (Dr. Wing-
field noted that an African strain of mari-
juana is showing up in this country which is
highly addicting. On the other hand, much
of the marijuana showing up at Washington
and Lee, which claims to be the Mexican
strain, is not really marijuana at all. Often
it just consist of weeds.) Legalization of the
drug would entail establishing legal strengths
and keeping out all foreign, stronger strains.
Unfortunately, legalization would not neces-
sarily make it easier to control foreign strains,
according to government officials.

On the question of the government’s right
to legislate morality and restrict an individ-
ual’s rights to do whatever he wants to him-
self, Wingfield has no real answer. He com-
mented that this argument has always existed
and no one really knows where government
should draw the line.

We believe marijuana will eventually be
legalized, but it will take a long time and
much more research before this will be a
reality. In addition, it will take many educa-
tional programs to relate the effects—harmful
and harmless—of the drug. For the time be-
ing, however, it is imperative that the laws
concerning this drug be made less strict.
There are many inequities which exist and
these should be eliminated. We ask that stu-
dents take notice of the stiff court penalties.
They demonstrate that although marijuana
may not be physically or psychologically
damaging in a permanent sense, the laws
concerning its use may be.

In the final analysis, we must agree with
Dr. Wingfield when he told us, “I do not
agree with the Establishment on this subject.
I am not close-minded about its legalization.
But I do not have information to say it (mari-
juana) is bad; and I can’t say it’s good.”

I cannot allow three statements in
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi to pass
without comment,

(1) “The honor system's strength
on this campus lies largely rooted in
awe for fear) of the Executive Com-
mittee.”

Anyone who could make such a
statement has a condescending attitude
toward his fellow students, no sense
of personal honor or both.

I have not been affected by the
WAL Honor System as such because
| have a sense of personal honor
which precludes lying. cheating, of
stealing. | am noi so self-righteous as
to think | am the only one on campus
who feels this way. In fact, if | am
we do not have an honor sysiem

When a person does not cheat
because he is afraid of being caught
and punished, he is not doing it be-
cause of a sense of honor, Honor in
this sense is 4 negative rather than
a positive trail, and | for one want
no part of i

(2) “The adverse reaction (to Ron
Kessier's proposal that a person ac
cused of an honor violation be given

24 hours in which to prepare 4
defense) took several routes: 1) if
youre innocent, it is nearly
impossible to be convicted and be
innocent at the same time; 2) such

a proposal would allow many guilty
people more time to develop an ait-
tight lie.”

The Executive Commitice seems to
be more concerned with conviction
than protecting the rights of the stu

deni. If a student is guilty of an
honor violaion, i would seem that
the EC could develop an airtight

prosecution in 24 hours much more

easily than the individual could de
velop an airtight defense
The EC would have us take its

word that it has proven to be in-
fallible when it comes to convictions
—that it could not possibly convict
an innocent person, although a guilty
| person might occasionally go unpun-
ished, With this reasoning, a student
does not need to have any basic civil
rights to fall back on when he is
accused of a violation,

If this is the attitude of the EC,
and it apparently is judging by the
unanimous votes against what seem-
ed to me to be very reasonable pro-

posals by Mr. Kessler, then the
Tuesday editor is right. These men
are not our peers. Nor are they

“leaders in questions of honor.” Gods
would be a more appropriate title

ident is ipso facto not a radical

hippie. Alan H. Cooper

Efficiency Award for 1968

lo our Editor:

It behooves us at this time to make
our first (and last) annual Efficiency
Award for 1968, After a long and
hot debate over whether we should
give the coveted award to ourselves
for fooling the whole campus into

that there were other unknown effici-
ent powers of wisdom beyond our

 

own,

Marijuana: Pro and Con
Opinions at W&L

(EDITOR’S NOTE: The follow-
ing story has been revised by the
author from a story which ap-
peared in the Dec. 8, 1968, edition
of the Richmond Times-Dispatch.

Times-Dispatch News Bureau

LEXINGTON — According to a
local physician, marijuana grows wild
in the fields of Rockbridge County.

The students at Washington and
Lee apparently know nothing about
it. And the doctor says they probably
would not recognize it if they saw
it.

If some of the students—and few
are venturing guesses as to their
number—could find these fields, they
could save themselves a lot of trouble.

As it is, they have to buy it—
from students at other colleges, from
“pushers” in the big cities, or, as one
student did, from a_ hitchhiker he
picked up on his way to school at
the end of the summer.

Or if they are more industrious
they can grow their own marijuana—
in back yards if the land is available,
or in flower boxes.

“I would say that at least a third
of the students here have tried smok-
ing ‘pot’,” said one senior who ad-
mitted taking marijuana regularly.
“And at least 10 per cent smoke it
regularly,”

“Those figures sound very high to
me,” said Dean Edward C. Atwood
Jr. “Ten per cent would mean 150
students are smoking marijuana
regularly, and | don’t think it is
anywhere near that level.”

Whatever the percentage of users
on the campus, marijuana is becom-
ing a major concern at Washington
and Lee.

A local minister delivered two ser-
mons on marijuana recently. Without
moralizing on the topic, he presented
evidence to his congregation to edu-
cate them on the issue.

In early December President Robert
E. R. Huntley called a special as-
sembly of faculty and students to
express his fear that marijuana might
become a major “pre-occupation” at
a time when there are so many other
important matters to be faced.

Earlier in the week, Huntley had
told a reporter that “the problem is
generally widespread nationwide, be-
ginning at relatively tender ages, at,
say, the high school level.”

Huntley lists several reasons for
his concern about the “pot” problem.

“Of course, my major concern is
the harm it is likely to do the avid
users of it. | know that the debate
is raging over the effects of marijuana.

“And | know many argue that it
is not addictive. But it could well be
habituating in the sense that any
stimulating experience is habituating.

“And also, by the time the debate
settles, the problem might be too
large—it might be an accepted social
custom—to do anything about.”

“Even if it is assumed that it has
no ill effects, it concerns me for a
number of reasons,” he added.

“It would seem that marijuana ts

By PEACE

It is now the time for Americans
of all religions and philosophies to
realize the tenor of their times and
allow the legalization of marijuana.
The legacies of “puritanism” in
American thought have been per-
mitted to permeate—or should one
say pollute—the private and personal
actions of the individual in a theoreti-
cally democratic society for too long
a period.

The decision to take part in the
use of marijuana should reflect not
the paranoia of antiquated laws, but
the free and unhindered decision of
an individual, as is now the case
with liquor, cigarettes, reading ma-
terial and our own personal actions.
We stand as mute witnesses while a
civilization grinds itself to a halt in

a jungle 10,000 miles away. Yet
those of us who care about the
country and where it is going can

not reconcile the heady propoganda
issued from some office of Bureau-
cracy in Washington claiming we
are fighting for freedom while at

 

home, people are denied a very basic
freedom: the freedom of choice.

There are other attributes that

America’s needs are not met due to
the lack of financial resources incurred

Cagers Take

Split First Two of 1969

BULLETIN: The Generals upped
their record to 10-2 by beating
Bridgewater 73-67 in a close game
on the Eagles court. Mel Cart-
wright and Mike Neer led the Gen-
erals with 18 and 17 points. Game
honors went to the Eagles’ Rick
Wampler, who had 31. Tomorrow
the Generals host West Virginia
Wesleyan and Monday they play
Elon, also here.

Washington and Lee saw one win-
ning streak broken over the holidays
but started another Tuesday night at
Doremus Gymnasium. Coach Can-
field and his charges got a “nice
Christmas present” with an easy vic-
tory in their own W&L Invitational
beating Shepherd College 89-65 and
Bloomsburg 87-75 in the finals. This
boosted the hosts’ winning streak to
eight, following an opening game loss
to Randolph-Macon.

January 4th saw the Generals in
Baltimore taking on Baltimore U. and
suffering an 89-73 loss, breaking their
streak and representing the worst loss
of the young season, But the recently
returned student body saw W&L
bounce back with an 80-75 win over
Virginia Commonwealth at home.

lhe Generals were perhaps a little
inhospitable in their tournament, win-
ning with ease and garnering most of
the individual honors. Shepherd put
up a good fight in the beginning and
tied the score at 10-10 after about 5
minutes of play. But Mel Cartwright
began to display his magic, and the
Rams from West Virginia fell be-
hind, Foul calls hurt the visitors and
Shepherd had to give up the services
of star Bill Thompson early in the
second half. Capitalizing on 52 free
throw chances, the Generals placed
four men in double figures: Cartwright
with 24, Mike Neer 18, Stu Fauber

the championship pitted Blooms- |
burg against the home forces, after |
the Pennsylvanians had blasted Glas- |
boro 93-77 the previous night. |
Bloomsburg jumped out to an early |
lead, as much as seven points at one |
time, but once again Cartwright |
proved the key, handing the Gen-|
erals their first lead on a jumper
from the corner. Neer went on a six |

point scoring binge to give Wal |
un eleven point halftime spread!
and a comfortable margin. Once

again the winning Generals had four |
players in double figures. Cartwright
led again with 24. Neer followed with
16, and twelve rebounds to go with

game. Charlie Stone, the other half
of Martinsville’s gift to Washington
and Lee basketball, kicked in with 16
markers and sophomore Bill Rhyme
added 14,

Cartwright was an obvious choice
for MVP and Neer joined him on the
all-tournament team, Bloomsburg
placed Bob Snyder, Sphepherd added
Bill Thompson (who led them to an

89-86 consolation win over Glass-
boro), and Glasboro sent Charlie
Russo.

Last Saturday Washington and Lee
traveled to Maryland for an encounter
with Baltimore U. The Generals went
into the game tied for tenth place in
field goal percentage, blistering the
nets at a 50.4 per cent clip. But the
Bees had a gaudy record themselves,
a 6-2 mark with one loss coming to
nationally-ranked La Salle. Coach
Canfield knew his boys could shoot
and score, but he feared that de-
fensing Baltimore's sensational sopho-
more Isaiah Wilson might be the real
task. Wilson, a 6-2 jumping jack,
had impressive credentials and the
game more than proved that the press
clippings were true, Wilson blitzed the
visitors for thirty points, nineteen of
which came in a second half spurt
that gave the game to Baltimore. The

 

were well ahead at the end 89-73.
Mike Neer led W&L with 24 points,
but Cartwright was held to twelve |
and Neer was lost to the Generals |
with five minutes left on fouls.

Tuesday Washington and Lee edged |
Virginia Commonwealth 80-75, once
again paced by the scoring of Magic
Mel Cartwright. The Rams could not
contain the baseline drives on the big
junior, and Mel time and again
treated a boisterous crowd of Gen-
eral fans to the fluid layups that have
become his trademark. Mel managed
24 points and received ample help
from Neer underneath and = sharp-
shooter Norwood Morrison from out-
side. Morrison was also instrumental
in breaking the VCU press of the
late stages. Despite Cartwright’s fine
point total, he had to surrender game
honors to leaping Charlie Wilkins,
with 28. Keith Lawson added 27 and
Len Creech contributed some fine play
in the closing minutes to make the
game close.

as many as ten officers plot to bust
someone for possession of nickel bag
while in that same city serious and
brutal crimes are rampant.

It is a given medical fact that un-

like alcohol, marijuana is not ad-
dictive and need not lead to other
drugs. It is not the doctor who

opposes the legalization of marijuana,
but the scared politician. This is the
same politician who utters some
grandiose speech on the Fourth of
July concerning American democracy,
and then denies a basic premise of |
democracy to his constituents.

Students tend to agree.

“IT know there’s acid on campus,”
said one student, a campus leader,
who says he was offered some at a
“pot” party, “But there’s not much.
I don’t think anyone is mainlining
(injecting drugs or narcotics with a
needle). It’s manly all oral stuff,

“For example, one guy had some
has (the intoxicant hashish) choco-
late chip cookies—you eat them, a
few minutes later you get a high.”

The obvious factor of the “seep-
age” of the marijuana supply from
the students at the university to the
local high schools does not yet seem
to be of major proportions.

“We have no evidence of any use
of marijuana by our students,” said

Frank Thompson, principal of Lex-
ington High School.
“Of course we have the usual

rumors of students experimenting with
drugs and narcotics, but rumors
abound at every school.”

But, as one student said, principals
are often the last to know,

FASHION EDITOR

ALL RIGHT NOW, when was the last time you wrote home? Well,

we suggest this might be a good time to

larly with the holidays coming

get off a letter—particu-
up. Granted it’s more blessed to

give than to receive... but it never hurts to drop a few hints, And
here are some fashion items that might make excellent entries on

your Christmas list:

SPORTCOATS SURGE to the fashion fore-

ground with big, bold plaids—giant Glens, win-
dowpanes, pattern-on:pattern overplaids—the
bolder the better, Side vents are deep...up to

 

 

 

 

14 inches ...and waist suppression furthers the
: trend toward shape. While on sportcoats, we
should mention the Billiard Cloth Blazer. Tai-
lored in bulky, hefty baize in single and double-

breasted models, these new blazers have the
t soft, smooth look of a billiard table-top—with
colors to match. In addition to the traditional

navy, brighter blazers will be seen in real bil-

liard green and camel, tan and gold shades.
Try this blazer with patterned slacks—so pop-

ular right now

| of points.

THE EASY SUIT bring

and you should chalk up lots

; —z—

cept to college wardrobes, with

gangs of latitude for the imaginative dresser. In this case “easy”
means “easy to interchange,” for this is a suit that can be just as
easily worn with turtleneck as with shirt and tie. The jac kets range

from variations on the Regency the

me to double-breasted pea-coats

++-fome are fly-front, some collarless. Trousers are generally
slightly flared...and the over-all look wil! stamp the wearer with
distinct individuality—no bad thing in this era of fashion revo-

lution.

LAST MINUTE SUGGESTIONS for that Christmas list: matching

mufflers, gloves and sweaters in bright wools, either solid celer o1
border-striped ... bodyline sportshirta,..toiletries (there's auch :
raft of new products and scent *, we suggest you check them o

first...then indicate specific preferences),

And for Pete’a aake

don't forget to tell Aunt Martha neckties are getting wider this

year!
