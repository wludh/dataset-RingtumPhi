I felt the need for perhaps a more
objective exposition of the legal as-
pects of marijuana and of the ad-
vantages of legal marijuana as ex-
pressed by Peace. In this article |
am entirely indebted to the March
1968 edition of the Columbia Law
Review (known in the Law School as
68 Columbia Law Review 521) en-
titled “Hallucinogens.” Although the
main thrust of the article concerns
the legal aspects of hallucinogens, it
contains a lengthy introduction on
“the drugs and their effects on the
user.”

I do regret that Peace found it
necessary to involve marijuana with
Vietnam, and his statement that civili-
zation has ground to a halt seems
somewhat debatable and sad with its
assumption that the entire American
nation is stagnating because of Viet-
nam.

1 would first like to summarize
portions of the Columbia article con-
cerning the effects of marijuana on
the individual. The actual manner in
which marijuana chemically affects
the brain is unknown, “With mati-
juana . available information is
more enlightening about the state of
mind that is produced than about the
chemical reaction or other reactions
that produce it.”

Prolonged usage of marijuana can
create mental instability. The Law Re-
view states that “such an experience
may seriously impair a person’s men-
tal stability and confidence over a
fairly long period.” It also states that
“there is also the possibility of long-
term personality change and brain
damage caused by repeated use of
any of the drugs, including marijuana.
While much of the immediate mental
injury seems to be related to pre-

faculty concerning any topic. The
opinions expressed in this column
do not necessarily represent those

existing mental states there is some
very inconclusive evidence of long-
term damage caused primarily by the
drugs. Most of the evidence is from
observations of long-term hashish
users in the Near East; the resulting
condition seems to resemble senility.”

Peace first states that government
sale of marijuana could be an im-
portant source of revenue. This leads
one to think of a USMC (United
State Marijuana Control) store next
to your friendly ABC store. Peace,
I am sure, would be surprised to
learn that the basic law on = mari-
juana does involve taxation, On a
federal level, the possession of “un-
taxed” marjuana is a crime; posses-
sion of marijuana that has been taxed
with both the buyer and seller regist-
ered is technically legal on the fed-
eral level. There are also laws pro-
hibiting the interstate commerce of
unregistered marijuana and the im-
portation of marijuana. Hence, the
possession of any marijuana which
can be traced to origin in another
state or country is illegal. On top of
the federal laws there are comple-
mentary state laws that support the
federal law. At one time it was pos-
sible to legally use the taxed and
registered marijuana with a prescrip-
tion, but recently marijuana was re-
moved from the category of drugs
for which a prescription may be
issued,

Peace bases his plea for legalizing
of marijuana on the freedom of indi-
vidual choice. | am glad Peace does
distinguish the delicate balance be-
tween order and freedom. Basically
every additional increment of per-
sonal freedom and liberty involves a
sacrifice of the order and stability of
some small part of the society. Is

Howard Nemerov

Noted poet reads

in reappearance

Poet and teacher Howard Nemerov
will make a return visit to the Wash-
ington and Lee University campus
next week to lecture and read from
his poems.

See review on page 2 of Ne-
merov’s latest work of poetry.

Nemerov will read from his works
Tuesday night and will lecture Wed-
nesday night on “Poetry and Mean-
ing.” Both appearances are sponsor-
ed by the Glasgow Endowment Com-
mittee and will be at 8:15 p.m. in
duPont Auditorium on the W&L
campus. Nemerov has also scheduled
a stop at the Bookstore for Wednes-
day afternoon.

A former writer-in-residence at
Hollins College and consultant in
poetry to the Library of Congress,
Nemerov previously visited Washing-
ton and Lee in 1962 under the Glas-
gow program.

A graduate of Harvard, Nemerov
is presently teaching at Brandeis Uni-
versity.

vided by Les and Larry Elgart will

EC; exam reform approved

In the Executive Committee's first
meeting in its new quarters in the
new Student Union Jay Passavant
announced that appointment of junior
Steve Sandler as the student repre-
sentative on the faculty Executive
Committee. Joe Tompkins and Rob
Bauer reported on their investigation
into the structure and activities of the
Dance Board; and Staman Ogilvie and
Rob Turnbull presented their proposal
on an independent exam schedule,

Passavant stated that the main pur-
pose of the student on the faculty
EC would be as liaison between the
student EC and the faculty as a
whole. Because of this, he felt that
it was imperative that the repre-
sentative be a member of the EC.
Passavant noted that the EC now has
the privilege to report to the faculty
at the beginning of every faculty
meeting.

The Ogilvie-Turnbull committee's
plan for an independent exam sched-
ule requires the student to decide
what he wants for his exam schedule
two weeks before exam week. Exam
week will consist of 10 days instead
of the present 10 academic days.
There will be three potential testing

 

periods every day. Exams may be
taken in the morning, afternoon, or |
night (except for Sunday when only |
afternoon exams will be possible). |

There are several problems that
have to be solved by the faculty be-
fore the system can be adopted. First,
the system is fairly inflexible if a
professor wants to give am exam
longer than three hours, Secondly,

 

Student apparently beaten;

parently beaten on the W&L campus
somewhere between Washington An-

information is scanty, but according
to Clark he was jumped by what he
believed to be three people. He then
completely blacked out and did not
remember anything until he arrived
in Washington after having gone to
the Lexington bus terminal and travel-
ed to Washington where his sister
lives.

A Washington hospital confirmed
that he had suffered a slight con-
cussion, He has since returned home.
Both Bob Murray and Dean Atwood
have been concerned with the incident
and they are not at all sure whether
it was WAL students or local towns-
men who attacked him,

IFC Judicial Board puts
Betas on social probation

rhe Judicial Board of the IFC has
pul the Beta Theta Pi fraternity on
social probation through March | and
prohibited all pledging activities in-
cluding initiation also until March |
This action was taken as a_ result
of certain actions by the Betas dur
ing their Christmas party of December
i4. The SAC, in reviewing the Judi
cial Board decision, placed the Betas
on conduct probation for the fe-
mainder of the academic yeat

Social probation prohibits any girls
from entering the fraternity house and
prohibits any gathering of more than
five members of the fraternity at any
place except the fraternity house

Conduct probation is essentially a
warning that if any additional cases
involving that fraternity will be dealt
with more severely by the Judicial

there are several courses for which
an independent exam is unfeasible
such as fine arts and music classes
where slides might be part of the
exam. The exam period was shortened
to 10 days as a consideration to the
faculty who fear that many students
will schedule their exams during the
last few days; hence the professor will
not have most of his exams to grade
until the very last day. The shortened
exam week, therefore, allows three
days at the end of exam week for
the professors to grade papers before
they are required to submit grades.
The proposal presented by Ogilvie

passed unanimously, Steve Sandler
then moved that the last academic

day before exams be set aside for
a reading day. He said that the
present lack of a reading day before
the January exams would be per-
petuated. His motion was seconded
by Dean Kumpuris. The motion pass-
ed 8-2 with Ogilvie and Turnbull vot-
ing against the amendment and senior

Faculty books range from history

The headline above is a little mis-
leading in that this is not particularly
a story about faculty publications.
There are several listed here, but our
intention is to apologize.

In No. 22 (Dec. 10) of this news-
paper, we ambitiously undertook to
publish the name of every book a
Washington and Lee professor has
ever written, and it appears we failed.

Our research staff consisted of
freshman reporter Mack Woodward,
who did all of the tracking down him-
self (with only the aid of suggestions
from the balance of the staff). Further
thwarting our goal was the lack of
a few inches of space just before we
went to press.

This happens every week, of course,
and stories ranging from the Debate
Team to the Executive Committee
to the basketball team to a movie
review often have to be cut.

But to those who may have wond-
ered why certain books were not
covered, we offer our humblest
apologies. We have made an effort in
this edition to cover those works
omitted Dec. 10-—Ed.

Chemistry Professor Esmarch §.
Gilreath has written numerous works,
including “Fundamental Concepts of
Inorganic Chemistry.”

Commerce Professor L. K. John-
son has published “Sales and Market

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Staff editorials

On parietal regulations

We hope that the Student Affairs Committee will soon
take affirmative action on the IFC’s proposal to allow girls
above the ground floor of the fraternity houses. The need for
such a change has been adequately discussed in the past, but the
SAC has said that they have three major areas of concern.

First, they would like a more concrete set of regulations
governing when and under what circumstances girls would be
allowed above the first floor. Needless to say, removing all
restrictions on girls in the fraternity houses would be the most
ideal situation, but a realistic approach for the moment would
be to allow girls above the first floor whenever they would be
allowed in the fraternity house. Therefore they would have to
be out of the house by 2 or 3 a.m.

Opponents of this change like to say in a very scandalous
tone, “But there are nothing but bedrooms above the first
floor!’’ The SAC expressed a similar concern. They apparently
would like a room or two that are not bedrooms above the
first floor. Many houses do have non-bedrooms above the first
floor. A room serving as the fraternity library is not uncom-
mon above the first floor. And many students like to combine
two rooms, putting all the beds in one room and the desks
in another. If the fraternities could guarantee that there would
be one of these study rooms on each floor, then perhaps the
faculty would be more willing to make this change.

Furthermore, we are still somewhat puzzled over the dis-
tinction between the fraternity houses and the apartments.
There is a sizable investment made by both the fraternities
and the University in the 18 fraternity houses, and it seems
quite mystifying why the faculty would impose this restriction
which enhances the desirability of apartment living.

The SAC’s final area of concern dealt with assurances from
the fraternities that if this restriction were eliminated there
would be significant increases in the number of upperclassmen
living in the houses. The faculty could very well agree to this
change contingent to the fraternities’ requiring 50° of those
living in the house to be juniors and seniors.

We can only hope that the SAC and the faculty will soon
take affirmative action on this proposal and that they will
simultaneously examine the same parietal restrictions imposed
on the dormitories. —R.W.K.

 

An advocate honor trial?

There are several facets of the debate on the honor system
which we feel deserve comment. There are many who feel
that the accused honor violator should have the responsibility
of preparing a defense. The Friday Ring-tum Phi of December
13 stated that “As the situation now stands, the Executive
Committee is called upon to function as prosecution, defense,
judge and jury.” Realistically the EC acts only as a jury.
They objectively determine the guilt or innocence of the
accused.

If the EC were to allow the accused to present his de-
fense, there would be two undesirable ramifications. First would
be the simultaneous creation of an independent prosecution,
for if the EC were to allow a “defense attorney” and not a
prosecution, the system would be almost completely weighted
in favor of the accused. The EC would more than likely have
to select one of its members to give up his vote and act as a
prosecutor attempting to the best of his ability to convict the
accused honor violator.

The second ramification deals with the varying “legal
competence” of the accused. It is more than obvious that
some students with the so-called legal mind would be able to
create an adequate defense, but there will be even more stu-
dents who will be entirely at a loss to create a defense; and
they will be at an even greater disadvantage when compared
with the experienced EC prosecutor.

We are sure many people have been touched with the
sense of hypocrisy inherent in the American advocate court
system where the defense attorney does all that he can to get
his man acquittted and the DA goes to great lengths to convict
the defendant. Their actions do not resemble men seeking the
truth, but men protecting their own interests. We feel that
the potential strengthening of the honor system through the
adoption of a variation of the advocate system is almost
negligible if it does not lead to a weakening of the system.

The Friday Ring-tum Phi said that it was concerned with
the nearly impossible conviction of an innocent man, There
is not a criminal court in the United States that does not run
this risk. One member of the EC recently stated that he was
convinced that anyone with any skill at lying would be acquitted
unless the physical evidence was overwhelming. And we are
still far from convinced that shift from the tribunal system to
an advocate system would at all reduce the chance of error
in the EC’s verdict.

We also question the Friday Ring-tum Phi’s rather loose
comment on the “peerage” of the EC members. Friday quoted
a Tuesday editorial stating “men of the EC are not our peers.”
We would like to finish the sentence: “They are, by their
election to that position, our leaders in questions of honor.”
We would agree that it would be very difficult to support the
first part of the sentence, but the EC are definitely not our
peers in questions of honor. They have to squarely face the
issue of honor almost weekly, while the question of honor is
incidental to the lives of most W&L students; the average
student almost never has to intellectually face the concept of

honor in his four years at W&L. —R.W.K.

PRSERVE AND _ PROTECT, by

$6.95,

By LARRY HONIG
Editor-in-Chief

In his latest attempt and the third
unsuccessful sequel to the brilliant
“Advise and Consent,” author Allen
Drury comes off as a rather pompous,
soap-operaesque George Orwell in
“Preserve and Protect,” labeling the
unlabelable, black and white.

Those of us who were captivated
by “Advise and Consent” will, after
“Preserve and Protect,” perhaps give
up hope that from the pen of this
crack journalist can come another
worthwhile political novel. Although
Drury has left the doldrums of “A
Shade of Difference” and the dull
duplicity of “Capable of Honor,” he

4
r

    

 

Drury .... finished?

falls far short of holding the reader's
attention through this, his fourth in a
series of works whose pattern is less
than clear.

Drury’s central—and fatal—flaw is
that he has at once too much plot and
not enough action. At the beginning
of the book, the President of the
United States dies mysteriously, just
after having been renominated.

In contention to head the new
ticket are two men; one is the ex-
President's running mate, pure, gentle-
manly, righteous, diligent preserver
and protector Orrin Knox. Even his
name smacks of the dignity of Ulti-
mately Good Destiny.

Opposing Knox is evil Ted Jason,
governor of California, whose hench-
men pistol-whipped Knox's pregnant
daughter-in-law at the convention
(where Jason was edged off the ticket),
a man whom everyone in a white
hat hates—even his wife.

But as Drury is ever so kind to
point out on nearly every page, those
who have access to the communicative
media do not wear white hats.

There is no dearth of acerbic re-
marks directed at the good guys by
all the major newspapers, including

Drury’s latest doesn’t
leave you breathless

the unnamed “Greatest Publication
That Absolutely Ever Was.” Also
throwing jabs are columnist Walter
Dobius, a dubious character of “Cap-
able of Honor” fame, and television
commentator Frankly Unctious.

One would be inclined to laugh off
these bitter allusions were it not that
Drury continually makes them.

So what's the root problem that
has turned reasoning topsy-turvy in
the United States a la 1985?

Violence.

It is an era when revolutionary ele-
ments in the country have forced their
beliefs into control of the mass media,
which, in turn, have the “ability,
through column, syndicate and broad-
cast, to condition the country coast-
to-coast.”

And the country has been condi-
tioned to accept bad guy Jason as
hero-to-be and his condoning of
violence as fair enough price to pay
for ambition’s rewards.

The action quickens, temporarily,
as the National Committee—amid
riots, bombings, and so forth—is
called to select its party's candidate.
While their decision and the poli-
ticking thereabout make up almost all
of “Preserve and Protect” there are
countless, not-so-subtle intrigues which
dot the pages with annoying fre-
quency.

Annoying, and dull, Drury wastes
thousands of words achieving two
needless objectives: acquainting the
reader with voluminous details from
the backgrounds of each character (to
further justify the presence or absence
of a white hat), and interjecting the
socio-political philosophy of only the
good guys, foreshadowed by his de-
dication of the novel “To the hopeful,
the well-meaning and the good heart-
ed, who may still be in the ma-

jority.”
Drury’s conclusion is amazing. Ted
Jason is brought into The Holy

Camp, or so Knox believes, betraying
Dobius, Unctuous & Co., yet eager
to join The Cause in reuniting and
restoring America. Knox is selected
as candidate for President; Jason ac-
cepts the Vice-Presidential slot. And
on the last page, one of the two men
is assassinated.

The author plans to write yet
another sequel, which presumably will
allow avid readers to stop holding
their breaths. Hopefully he will at
least inject a measure of believability
absent in this disaster.

“Preserve and Protect” is a perfect
book to keep by the bed; its diversions
are lengthy enough to induce sleep,
and when reading is resumed the
next night Drury can be trusted to
recapitulate (or regurgitate) the theme
—violence—and his ceaseless views
thereon.

For all its poor points, though,
this political novel does communicate
some of the author's vast and inti-
mate knowledge of the machinations
of present-day politics—at the Capital
and the United Nations, in the press,
and in the lives of those who are em-
powered to preserve and protect.

Enigmatic Nemerov is more
‘aware’ than some think

By KIRK WOODWARD

Howard Nemerov, the remarkable
poet, will appear tonight and Wednes-
day night at duPont auditorium.
Therefore one can say that the Glas-
gow lectures give us the opportunity
to hear a live poet, if one sees the
ambiguity of “live.” Nemerov un-
questionably breathes, etc.; but his
poetic career has constantly made its
subject the fact that a poet can write
without any life to him at all.

Nemerov, or any poet nowadays,
lives in a culture that considers him
“ex officio” dull. From experience the
poet hardly expects the “public” to
take him seriously, and what's more
the public resents him for not trying
to “communicate.” As a compromise
the poet teaches and travels around
giving readings to audiences like our-
selves: a solution that doesn’t satisfy
anybody.

So the poet has to write assuming
that (a) he has something somehow
important to say, and (b) nobody
will pay any attention, A discourag-
ing occupation (or habit). Minor
poets, feeling the strain, write poems
about this isolation. Nemerov writes
poems taking responsibility for the
situation himself, and as a result is
more than a minor poet.

Here are three qualities which
many poets have. Nemerov, however,
has them working together. They are:
a sense of humor, an awareness of
his own time, and a consciousness of
words, especially his own.

As to humor, after Nemerov’s read-
ing here in 1965, he was criticized for
his statement that “the structure of
a poem resembles the structure of a
joke,” and for making the audience
laugh. The criticism comes no doubt
from people who consider laughter a
jolly sort of thing. Nemerov’s humor,
however, springs from his sense of
the sudden discovery of something
which, if seen for itself, would cause
desperation. His humorous subjects
exist because the culture that invent-
ed them finds them important instead
of comic.

The structures of a joke and a
poem are similar because they both
bring on a sudden awareness of an
unrecognized piece of the world,
Nemerov's desperation grows from
this realization, that the world can
only be experienced fully if taken by
surprise,

His humor, as mentioned, often
concerns public events in our culture,
We know them all and are tired of

listing them: money, culture, ads,
television, supermarkets, certain
preachers .. . . Nemerov, however,

does not confront this civilization as
an enemy, but rather sees himself as
a part of it, perhaps even a cause,
and wonders what living in such a
world could do to him, or to any-
one. The culture, though, opposes this
kind of questioning. So Nemerov is
really a radical, but not dangerous,
for reasons to be considered in a
moment.

Then, Nemerov is aware that his
own words may be taken the way
ads are, as simple objects of at
tention, He knows that the better he
constructs his poetry, the more it
can be looked at just poetry, His
knowledge is trapped in his verse. The
fact that many of his poems are funny
shows that in this dilemma he can
still keep his head above water

So why isn’t Nemerov dangerous’
Well, he knows too much. His aim
is to increase self-knowledge. or at

and is more resiliant, Besides that,
most tries at “communicating” are
disguises for isolation so deep it can
never really be transcended. So no
“public” will stand for such a vision
as Nemerov'’s, no poet can make the
public listen, and no individual can
understand what Nemerov says un-
less he makes it clear for himself.

Clearly Nemerov goes against the
grain of society, which claims that
death is an illusion and that we can
all be brothers. Nemerov considers
these claims as barriers to being able
to see the world at all.

Nemerov longs to be able to see
things just for themselves. The mo-
ments of joy in his poetry come at
times when he makes a part of the
world—say, an animal, or something
in himself—appear in its own being.
He is keenly aware that he has to
“make” the thing appear that way
himself, but he knows that poetry
transcends defeat only by celebration.

Defense was the name of the game
Saturday night as Washington and Lee
took its eleventh win of the season.
The opponent, West Virginia Tech’s
Golden Bears, had hoped to slow
down the game and slip by the Gen-
erals. However, W&L rose to the
challenge and beat the Bears at their
own game.

The first half went slowly with only
a total of 36 points scored by both
teams. The Generals jumped ahead
early to a three point margin, Lead-
ing W&L were Fauber and Cart-
wright hitting extremely well from the
outside and Mike Neer blocking shots
underneath. About midway through
the half Tech had tied the score at
7-7. Tech then attempted to freeze the
ball and force W&L to change their
defense. But excellent defense by the
Generals took the ball from Tech and
Washington and Lee jumped ahead
once again by four. Morrison hit a
long one from outside and Mel Cart-
wright moved in close where he was
devastating, and the Generals left the
half leading 20-16.

In the second half W&L used its

 

outstanding match-up defense to halt
Tech. The key to the defense was
Mike Neer, who successfully clogged
up the middle and stopped any pene-
tration underneath. The Generals also
dominated the boards and moved in
closer for their shots. West Virginia
Tech could not work the ball inside
and had erratic shooting with the
exception of Tim Floyd who shot
very accurately time and again.

Mel Cartwright played a typically
superb game. He led the scoring with
19 points and had several spectacular
assists, rebounds and defensive plays.
Mel also proved that he could shoot
as well outside as inside,

Mike Neer was right behind Cart-
wright in scoring with 16 points. Neer
dominated both boards snatching 19
rebounds and teamed up with Cart-
wright for easy baskets.

But enough cannot be said about
Washington and Lee’s defense. With
the game so low-scoring, it was criti-
cal that W&L keep the pressure on
the Bears’ offense. So the Generals
used their match-up defense with Stu
Fauber and hustling Charlie Stone

Natators hand Cavaliers first loss in Doremus upset

By REEVE KELSEY

Baltimore Bill Brumback, co-cap-
tain Billy Ball, and freshman John
Lawlor sparked one of the sweetest
swimming victories as Coach Stearns’
swimmers upset the University of Vir-
ginia, 53-51, a meet not decided until
the last relay.

Washington and Lee opened up in
the 400 yard medley relay with their
strongest swimmers and set a new
pool and school record of 3:34.9 and
barely touched out UVa. The combi-
nation of Ball (backstroke,) Klein
Stuart (breaststroke), David Kympton
(butterfly), and Bill Brumback (free-
style) gave the Generals a 7-0 lead.

In the next event, the 1000 yard
freestyle, Lawlor set a new school
record with a time of 11:37.6 seconds.
Ross Forman managed a third in the
200 freestyle. Then Brumback re-
turned after a short rest and won
the 50 yard freestyle with a winning
time of 21.5 and freshman Bim Clark
followed with a close third at 21.9
seconds. Billy Ball and Hal Catlin
then went one-two in the 200 indi-
vidual medley with Ball winning with
a 2:02.2 second time. Going into the
diving the Generals were protecting
a 27-16 lead.

The Wahoo’s divers were in good
form as they managed to capture
first and second leaving the third
spot to Mike Carrere. The Generals
fortunes continued to sink as John
Lawlor was only able to catch a
third in the 200 yard butterfly com-
ing in two seconds behind the winner.
Ross Forman, smarting from his de-
feat in the 200 freestyle, gained ade-
quate revenge as he won the 100 yard
freestyle sprint with a time of 47.9
seconds, Forman was supported by
junior Roger Martin who picked up
a third in the event. The score was
now tied 35-35,

Billy Ball then glided to a win in
the 200 yard backstroke thus giving
the Generals a scant one point lead.
John Lawlor, only two events away
from his previous performance in the
200 butierfly, stroked to an easy
victory in the S00 yard freestyle
event with a time of 5:25.6 boosting
the yardage he covered in the meet
to a respectable 1700 yards. As Klein
Stuart captured a third in the 200
yard breastroke for the Generals, the
score going into the final relay was
WAL 46, UVa SI.

The final General lineup was For-
man, Catlin, Martin, and Brumback

Hi

 

Sophomore diving ace Mike Carrere in competition against UVa Friday. Carrere could only salvage a third but the

natators still squeezed by the Wahoos,

a neck and neck race. As in the 400
medley relay, Brumback started on
his leg of the race behind by about
half a body length. After the first
23's yards Brumback had caught his
opponent and was on his way to win-
ning the relay with the overall time
of 3:10.0.

Coaches Stearns and Bart Taylor
suddenly found themselves in the pool
as the natators relished their third
victory of the season opposed to one
loss. This was the first loss for the
UVa mermen this year.

tatorium, Then tomorrow afternoon
there will be a junior varsity meet

Sounding off ...

By ROY CARLTON
Sports Editor

The time has finally come for
W&L’s Generals to leave the homey
confines of Doremus Gym and seek
their fortune elsewhere. The average
Mink-around-town can't say that he
isn't sorry to see them go. Despite
its cracking walls and creaking floors,
the Blue seem to have a knack of
winning there. Last year, all five
losses were suffered on the road. This
year, of the Generals thirteen games,
ten have been played at home with
a resulting 11-2 mark to date.

There are still eleven games to go,
including the Conference tournament.
Of those, six are on the road. In
addition, the Blue must face up to
their toughest match-ups of the year
in this final week before exams and
the week after. Remember, it was a
post-exam collapse that accounted for
four W&L losses and the denial of
an NCAA bid last year.

Starting tonight in Doremus, the
Generals must prove to the country
that they are the great team every
Mink thinks they are. Their opponent
is Florida Presbyterian who had no
trouble at all in mauling the Blue
down on the peninsula last year.

Tough games await Generals

Presbyterian is tough again this year
too. Hopefully, things will be dif-
ferent this time around. W&L has
improved since last year, the team
has not entered into the slump they
were in at that time last year, and
then there's always good old Doremus
to brighten things up. A very tight
game can be expected at any rate,
and certainly it’s a crucial one to the
Blue’s NCAA chances.

All of which brings us to Navy.
Tommorrow night the Generals play
their second major college hardcourt
team since de-subsidization was com-
pleted. Don't get excited and start
betting against W&L either. Unless
they're overawed by the Academy
itself, the Midshipmen shouldn't give
them any more trouble than a lot of
teams on the schedule. But this is

concerning their investigation of the
Dance Board. They first analyzed the
method of Dance Board ticket sales.
Compared with any other potential
system, the present method of ticket
sales seems to be the best for a
school of W&L’s size and location.
The present methods insure a greater
degree of economic stability than
could be obtained by any other sys-

of the large newspaper files there.
The Southern Historical Collection,
a reserve of many manuscripts of the
period located at the University of
North Carolina, is also of prime im-
portance to Dr. Crenshaw’s research
program.

In the Washington area, Dr. Cren-
shaw will make use of the newspaper
files and the large amount of manu-
scripts.

According to Dr. Crenshaw, most
of the material needed to write the
book is to be found in manuscripts,
printed materials, books, and gov-
ernment publications. Much of the
task that remains is the process of
organizing, writing, and rewriting.

The book should be ready for pub-
lication in 1970 or 1971.

Carlton’s always

still the big event of the season. A
victory over Navy would certainly
be enjoyed, to say the least.

How is Navy? Hardly powerful, but
still potentially dangerous, and their
4-6 record has been fashioned against
considerably tougher opposition than
the Generals have faced. They play
a deliberate, almost slow-down, type
of ball. Although they can match the
Blue in height with three men at
6-6, the tallest man on their starting
five is 6-5 Bill Parks, who isn’t exactly
another Lew Alcindor. The key to
Navy lies in 6-3 John Tolmie, a
senior who should make several sec-
tional all-star teams and maybe even
one or two All-America squads. He's
that good. Averaging about twenty-
five points a game, he’s carried his
mediocre teammates on his back all
year. Stop Tolmie and you stop Navy.
Air Force held him to eight points
Saturday night and beat the Midship-
men 73-46. That's the Generals’ as-
signment and you can bet it will fall
to 6-5 Mel Cartwright. Now maybe
folks will have a yardstick by which
to measure Mel's talent.

Navy will be tough and exciting,
but just as important and maybe
tougher will be tonight's match-up
with Presbyterian. It should be well
worth seeing, so don't start looking
ahead to the Middies, the Generals
aren't.

starting to contain West Virginia
Tech.

Washington and Lee handled the
ball well and eliminated their floor
mistakes, thoughout the game. The
Generals also showed muscles on the
boards, especially on defense. Yet
WAL had trouble capitalizing on
Tech's mistakes and could not pull
out ahead until late in the game. Al-
though this game was low-scoring and
slowed down, WAL dominated the
entire contest,

The Generals needed this game
badly to give them momentum against
Navy tomorrow night. So far Navy
stands 4-6 and Washington and Lee's
hot Generals have a good chance to
bring home a big win,

tem, and they noted that tickets will
be transferable in the future, thus
eliminating one of the major com-
plaints against the Dance Board’s
policy of ticket sales.

This apparent endorsement of the
Dance Board drew criticism from sev-
eral members of the EC. Sandler
stated that the present system was
a “rook” and that “the students get
absolutely nothing for their money.”
Passavant felt that the present system
of not allowing the sale of individual
tickets until the night before the
concert was not justified and that the
Dance Board should resume selling
individual tickets before each con-
cert with substantial savings going to
dance plan purchasers.

Tompkins then dealt with several
complex problems involving Doremus
Gym. The limited seating capacity
(about 2,000 saw the 4 Tops) and
other problems with the gym re-
stricted the flexibility of the Dance
Board.

It was reported that many attempts
in the last several years have been
made to obtain the use of the VMI
fieldhouse, but that the uncooperative
attitude, in general, of the VMI
officials involved had prevented the
use of the fieldhouse. Passavant said
that there were advantages to having
the concert on the W&L campus
with its easy location to most stu-
dents.

Tompkins then endorsed the pres-
ent booking agent used by the Dance
Board but urged that they keep an]
open mind concerning the potentials
of other booking agents. He stated
that the present agent has excellent
connections with most of the major
groups in the country. The Dance
Board has had no trouble in obtain-
ing refunds from performers who have
cancelled out at the last minute and
there seems to be no indication that
this booking agent is charging W&L
any more than the reasonable going
price.

Steve Sandler then stated that he
felt the Dance Board should attempt
to contract performers as far in
advance as possible so that a stu-
dent knows exactly what he is buy-
ing when he purchases his dance plan.
Dean Kumpuris replied that the ma-
jority of the groups do not like to
make a long-term commitment to a
concert such as W&L’s, for they have
no idea whether they might have a
hit record or an attractive night club
offer between the date of signing the
contract and the date of the con-
cert. Hence it is rather futile to at-
tempt to sign groups far in advance
of a given concert.

Tompkins said then that the Dance
Board membership was to a degree
self-perpetuating and that the same
type of people always seemed to be
on the Board. He noted that there
was a need for greater representa-
tion of the student body on the Board
as well as a more diverse type of
membership.

Other recommendations included
the need for a more diverse make-up |
of the present concerts. A comedian
or entertainer should be used to avoid
the dead spots present in most of the
concerts. The Dance Board account
should be removed from the general |
student body fund as the first step)
toward a needed reevaluation of the)
entire accounting system of the stu- |
dent body fund. These steps would
give Dance Board greater knowledge
of their financial postion at any given
moment.

It was also recommended that the
Dance Board president not be allowed
his present yearly salary of $250 and

In further business, Passavant re-
ported that he and Pete Hendricks
had a very profitable meeting with
President Huntley, Dean Atwood, and
Professor MecThenia of the Law
School. The meeting dealt with the
honor system. The ideas obtained
from this meeting will be fully dis-
cussed in the first EC meeting after
exams. Passavant noted that Presi-
dent Huntley and Professor McThenia
are not members of the EC commit-
tee to study the honor system but
merely are acting in the status of
advisors to this committee.

The EC then stated its future policy
toward observers at EC meetings. No
one may leave or enter the EC
meeting after 7:30 (the meetings start
at 7:15) as merely common courtesy
to the people in the meeting. He
also stated that no visitor will be
allowed to speak unless he has ob-
tained permission from the presiding
officer to present a proposal. This was
enacted to prevent the EC from be-
coming endlessly involved in a given
issue and to improve the efficiency
of the EC’s actions. Entrance to the
EC chambers is from the back of the
Student Union, by stairway from the

According to Dr. Feddeman, no
one without the special Hong Kong
flu innoculations would have any
immunity to the sickness. Even those
who had previously been ill with
Asian flu here would be succeptable
to the Hong Kong variety, which un-
like the Asian type, hits the patient
hard and keeps him sick for up to
a week.

When asked if the Hong Kong

that the quantity of it was limited
