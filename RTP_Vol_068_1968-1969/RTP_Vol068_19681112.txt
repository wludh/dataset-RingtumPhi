Much has been said within the!
last several years about student rights
and the student-university. The edi-
torials this week are illustrative of
this movement. Do the sophomores
living in fraternities have the right)
to the same privileges as those sopho- |
mores, juniors and seniors who live |
in apartments?

I will not take direct issue with
the Concerned Parents as that is done |
effectively by both the editorial and |

the letter to the editor. The restriction | Visiting Psychology lecturer, Dr. F. W. Fin

fraternity houses is the last major |
restriction on those living in the fra- |
ternities imposed by the faculty. The
fraternity houses as living facilities
are in limbo between dormitories and |
apartments, and I feel that they |
should be emphatically classified, at
least theoretically, as apartments.

The University requires only the
freshmen to live in dormitories prob-
ably on the theory that this is basic-
ally a year of transition between at-
home parentally-supervised living and
that of a completely self-ordered liv-
ing of the independent man.

After the freshman year the Uni-
versity does not impose any restric-
tion on where a sophomore or any
of the upperclassmen may live. Some
may pick apartments and have com-
plete access to all of the ripe moments
that they desire; a majority however
are coerced into living in the fra-
ternity houses basically to generate
the needed revenue to keep the house
running and meet mortgage payments.

Juniors and seniors, as a rule, do
not choose to live in a fraternity
house unless he is required to or
finds it advantageous for financial or
other reasons. This absence of juniors
and seniors from the fraternity house
is one of the major drawbacks to
the fraternities in the eyes of the
faculty.

rherefore it is a relatively artificial
and unconsisient rule of the faculty
that is the major stumbling block for
any influx of upperclassmen into fra-
ternity houses, The rule is discrimina-
tory against sophomore fraternity-
members in favor of non-fraternity
sophomores living in apartments, If
this rule had any theoretical justifica-
tion, why is it not universally applied
against all sophomores?

I hope that the faculty and the Stu-

Blood donations

urgently needed
for county quota

The blood drive sponsored by the
YR’s and the IFC is continuing this
week. It is imperative that WAL stu-
dents give blood toward the com-
munity quota so that blood will be
freely available to all Lexington citi-
zens and WAL students.

In past years, VMI has averaged
over 800 pints while WAL only con-
tributed 53 pints the last time the
bloodmobile was here. The blood-
mobile will be at W&L on December
12, but all students under 21 do need
permission from their parents be-
fore they can give blood,

Chairman Bill Tyler commented,

turnout five years ago was because

Spoleto, Italy.

Goode studied with Rudolph Serkin

fore beginning his worldwide tours.

Newspaper critics have been over-
whelming in their praise of Goode.
The Washington Post commented,
“Goode plays with facile dexterity
and with a fine sense of coloration
and balance. He produced sounds
that brought the piano into its truly
great light. I have never heard it
sound so beautiful.”

The program for the evening will
consist of Bach’s Patria No. 1, in
B-flat Major; Beethoven's Sonata in
in E Major, opus 109; Debussy’s Five
Preludes; Le Loriot by Messiaen; and
Chopin's Polonaise Fantasy, opus 61.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Reasoning
Cc

The following letter appeared in last Friday’s Ring-tum
Phi, and we are printing it again because we have a few words
in reply. Then letter read:

We read with interest the article in The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi of
October 22, concerning the IFC motion requesting the relaxation of the
regulation restricting girls to the lower floors of fraternity houses and

dormitories.

We wish to state now that if this regulation is relaxed and our son’s
fraternity approves a plan to allow girls in the ‘upper rooms’ of fraternity
houses, we will have to ask that he resign from his fraternity. He'll have
to; we're providing the funds. If he were living at home he certainly would
not entertain his girl friends in his bedroom! Why should we condone it in
college? This is no reflection on our son; we trust him. He has been taught
that such behavior is indiscreet.

But we are not so old that we cannot remember the temptations in-
volved when two young people of Opposite sexes are alone together and the
setting is ‘ripe.’ Getting a college education today is a tough enough job
without deliberately placing an extra burden of strain on self-discipline and
restraint, from the impropriety of having girls in boys’ bedrooms.
That's what it amounts to, no matter how fancy the language you use.

aside

Despite what many college students may think, we do not believe boys
and girls of that age are mature enough to be given complete freedom. The
very fact that such a request was made is a demonstration of that lack of
maturity. One of the reasons we were so happy our son chose W&L was
because there are certain restrictions imposed, and the student is not left
entirely on his own, He recognized this himself, and welcomed the disciplines
traditional at W&L.

We managed to make it through college without ‘decorating our rooms
as we chose, without liquor in our living quarters and without members of
the opposite sex in our bedrooms; and we like to believe this generation of
college students has as much stamina as ours.

We certainly hope the University administration will have the courage
to deny this request, in the same manner that a sane parent would deny a
like request.

In his Friday staff editorial, Lawrence McConnell missed
the point (though what he did write about was well written).
The letter is rather obviously from two intelligent and reason-
able parents who are concerned that their son is in danger
of having instilled in him, with the University’s sanction, some
values which are not accepted by society.

We would like to answer—in part—this letter with two
points, in the hopes that others may be made aware of the
reasoning behind the desire to allow girls in the upper floors
of fraternities.

 

First of all, it is moot to discuss the possible outcomes of
‘ripe’ situations’ or the maturity (or lack of it) of college
students. For even now, Washington and Lee is a school
where there are—in practical terms—no restrictions whatso-
ever. We're not talking about the fact that a boy and a girl
can, if they so desire, rent a motel room. It’s easier than that.

Several of the surrounding girls’ schools no longer have
any requirements as to where a girl stays in Lexington. And

 

The Ring-tum Phi—Tuesday

Tuesday, November 12, 1968

in this college town, there are literally hundreds of student
apartments, and one is easily available to any student, fraternity
member or not, for whatever reason he may choose. And
it is their choice. A few drinks with a date, a poker game, a
night of television and records, or “the impropriety of having
girls in boys’ bedrooms.” Without meaning impudence, it
hardly matters what kind of an atmosphere parents want for
their sons at W&L.

It is not only a matter of juniors and seniors living in
apartments. Certainly the freshmen must live in dormitories,
and most sophomores are required to live in their fraternity
houses, but almost all of these people have access to a stu-
dent apartment.

We think it has to be said that students at Washington
and Lee have, for the most part, assumed this mode of living
with the decency instilled in them by their parents.

Now to the specifics of the request to allow girls in fra-
ternity bedrooms. In proposing this resolution, Mr. Kelsey,
who is a fraternity president, had in mind the fact that few
except sophomores live in fraternity houses, that this is not
in the best interest of the fraternities since there is no upper-
class guidance, that the remedy would be to entice (or force)
older students to live in the houses, and that this would be
impossible unless girls could be allowed in the bedrooms.

The point is not that “since it’s done elsewhere, why not
in the fraternity houses?” What fraternities are really asking
is for a chance to better themselves by being able to have
upperclassmen live in their houses, and to be given the chance
to achieve this end by using means which are already very
much a part of life in Lexington.

Of prime consideration in selecting an editor-in-chief of cither Ring-tum
Phi is the ability to demonstrate leadership on the staff as well as in con-
veying an opinion, In order that interested readers may judge for them-
selves this ability of possible future editors, the staff will be able to use
the editorial columns for expression of ideas and views. It is with pride
in our staff that we present the first staff editorial.

full voting member of the Board for a term of one year.
The purpose of this move is “to try to narrow the generation
gap” which has been such a pre-eminent causal factor of
student disorder and unrest. By its having an undergraduate
member, the Board will be much closer to campus life, gaining
a more realistic and comprehensive perspective upon the stu-
dent situation; they will be able to realize and to serve better
the needs of the students.

A similar move at W&L might also prove to be extremely
effective, even as benign as the student situation is. The prob-
lems which face the Board of Trustees are not those of protest
and threatened violence, but rather more civil questions. W&L
has been able to handle itself quite well in the recent wave
of student riots, as it has always given the undergraduates a
large voice with which to express their views. And thus the
Board is concerned only with serving the direct needs of the
students, hence making it fertile ground for the inclusion of
a student opinion.

A student upon the Board of Trustees could indeed aid
this body in the understanding of student views and desires.
Many problems which students now encounter could be more
effectively voiced if presented in person by a student. Take
for example the case of the restriction of liquor on campus:
an undergraduate could better argue the position of the stu-
dents, showing that the abolishment of this rule would prove
to be most beneficial to all students. The dorm residents would
of course benefit most from this, but also the student body as
a whole would gain, as cocktail parties during the four dance
weekends could be held on one of the athletic fields. This
position could be explained in greater depth and with more
meaning than it has ever been previously. Perhaps this would
not cause a change in the rule, but at least it would give the
students the satisfaction that their feelings were expressed by
one of their own kind; they would also understand that the
Board was cognizant of the position of the undergraduates,
before taking action.

And so Washington and Lee might gain a great deal by
copying the action taken by the Vanderbilt board. This should
at least be considered, if mot acted upon, as the student
interests are deeply involved in this question. It will be truly
beneficial to both the students and the administration by
strengthening the ties of communication which lie between
them and by showing that the University really cares about
student views. The Board of Trustees should thus be urged
to consider the membership of a student for the improvement
of the entire Washington and Lee community.

Sounding off ...

Louisville—Nov. 17, 1951—It had
only been some ten months since
Washington and Lee’s Generals had
faced up to the University of Woym-
ing in the Gator Bowl. That had
been the climax to the most success-
ful season in W&L football history.
Now, once more, the Generals were
on the march .Despite devastating
losses to number one ranked Ten-
nessee and third ranked Maryland,
the Big Blue had racked up a 5-3
record so far, stood third in the
Southern Conference, first in Virginia,
and had even beaten the Wahoos for
the first time since 1937. They'd done
it in good style too, 42-14.

The schedule was fairly easy from
here on in. There were just two more
| games left, both pushover. Coach
| Barclay and his assistants had been
| trying to build up this game with

Modern W&L opponents can’t boast Unitas

Louisville. The Cardinals weren't
really as bad as everyone thought,
or so they tried to tell the team.
Louisville was anything but impres-
sive, though. Their record of three
wins and three losses included routs
by such “powerhouses” as Boston U.,
Cincinnati and Xavier. What would
the Generals do to them?

The scouting reports were surpris-
ing, however. Apparently, the Cardi-
nals had moved their third strong
quarterback, a freshman, up to the
starting slot. Since his promotion,
Louisville had won two out of three
and were even beginning to show
some semblance of an offense. Quart-
erback John Unitas had been termed
by the scouts as “a very fine quarter-
back with a good future.”

Still the Generals felt secure.
Theirs was the number one pass
defense in the nation, and no fresh-
man was going to cause it any strain.
Why even Tennessee had found it
impossible to throw against them.
The Vols had only completed four of
fourteen against a defense that had
allowed only 49.5 yards per game
passing.

As the captains walked to midfield
for the toss of the coin, a cold icy
wind swirled around them. Louisville

Washington and Lee’s football team
was handed a crushing defeat last
Saturday at the hands of the South-
western Lynx, 38-7. In the process

 

the W&L hopes of a championship in
the College Athletic Conference were

nailed down a first place tie with

won the toss and elected to kick so
that they could take advantage of the
wind.

The Blue couldn't move the ball,
and punted to the Cardinals 46.
Louisville's ramshackle offense, fresh-
man quarterback et al., trotted onto
the field. Two line bucks produced
next to nothing, and the home team
faced a third and eight situation. The
WAL defense braced itself for a pass.
Sure enough, Unitas stepped back into
his pocket and looked for his receiv-
ers. His halfback, Babe Ray was well
downfield and all alone. Ray hauled
it in on the twenty and scooted in
for the touchdown. A fifty-two yard
TD pass with only three minutes
gone. The conversion was good for
a 7-0 lead.

Except for the ego of the defensive
secondary, this really didn’t bother
the Generals too much. Their offense
was as explosive as any around, The
Cardinals defense was more than they
had counted on, though. W&L drives
were halted on the 12, 8, and 14. A
96 yard kickoff return by Jim Wil-
liams of Louisville at the beginning
of the second half made it 14-0, and
despite a TD and numerous drives by
the Blue in the fourth quarter, the
initial seven point lead Unitas had
provided stuck.

Johnny U. didn't bother the Gen-
erals too much the rest of that
afternoon. He had done enough al-
ready. The scouting estimates of him
proved to be correct to say the least.
Al season's end, Washington and Lee
still had the stingiest defensive sec-

that shaky things were to come.
About the only warming thing in the
bitter cold at Fargason Field in
Memphis was the Memphis W&L
alumni chapter, which turned out to

cheer the Generals on.
Things started off all right for
WAL, at least for the first ten

minutes remaining in the first quarter,
the Generals recovered a Southwest-
ern fumble on the latter’s eleven yard
line. Four plays later, Doug Gossman
cracked over from the one to make
it 6-0. Jack Baizley’s extra point was
perfect and the Blue led 7-0.

The tide seemed to be in the Gen-
eral’s favor as W&L took over again
on the SW 49 yard line. However,
on the very next play, fortune de-
serted the Blue and never returned.
The Generals committed the first of
three game-breaking fumbles. South-
western recovered, and promptly
marched 55 yards in 13 plays to tie
the ball game. The tally came on a
two yard plunge by Danny Black-
wood with the extra point by Randy
Mullins.

After each side had missed a field
goal in the second period, it looked
as if the half would end in a stale-
mate. But with only about two
minutes to go W&L committed its
second bobble of the day and the
Lynx got the ball on the Generals’
42. Two McKean passes to Mullins
put the ball on the ten yard line
where the Generals’ resistance stif-
fened. Southwestern then kicked a
sixteen yard field goal to lead at
halftime 10-7.

After this, the play of the dis-
spirited Generals became lethargic.
Southwestern broke the game wide
open by adding three touchdowns in
the last four minutes. To show just
how poor the Generals tackling got,
the last TD of the game came with
just three seconds remaining. The op-
posing coach sent in a senior at
quarterback who wasn't even on the
roster. With an obvious eye at run-
ning out the clock, he simply ran a
quarterback sneak and to everyone's
surprise, especially his own, he rambl-
ed to a 47 yard score.

Although the Generals were play-
ing a competent team that executed
well, it was obvious that WAL made
them look as well as they did. As
head coach Buck Leslie noted, “We're

disappointed in the way we played.
We feel that it was a game that we
weren't ready for mentally or emo-
tionally. I don’t know if it was let-
down after the Sewanee game, or
what. We're just disappointed we
didn’t play better.”

Washington and Lee's offensive
plans of having the quarterback run-
ning wide on the option play were
hurt by Chuck Kuhn’s hurt leg and
his lingering cold. Nevertheless, the
Generals’ fieldleader was the most
potent offensive weapon the Blue
could muster, gaining 111 yards on
nineteen attempts for a 5.8 yard
average. Coach Leslie also thought
halfback Doug Gossman played well
as did John Wolf, who played on a
gimpy knee.

added student responsibility in the
context of the University, but there
is a need for the Executive Com-
mittee, its Curriculum Committee, or
the ODK forum (if such a thing still
exists) to initiate proposals to be
presented to the administration or
the faculty, and for the administra-
tion or the faculty to either agree
or disagree.

The “powers that be” must de-
cide whether or not the student is
merely a product to be turned out
by management, or whether the stu-
dent should have some power over
the institutions of his own production,

dent Affairs Committee will consider
this issue not in the light of the
Concerned Parents but in the larger
sphere of what are the standards of
behavior, maturity, and responsibility |
that the sophomore class deserves and
that those living in fraternities de-
serve.

Moving briefly to the second of
the two editorials, much has been
said about student representation of
faculty committees and, now, admini-
strative committees. No action has
been taken, or to use a_ popular
phrase, a confrontation made. It is

Our concerned friends hope that
the University will have the “courage”
to deny this request. Well, it never
takes courage to maintain the status
quo; it is easy to deny. It does take
courage to accept change and to
recognize benefits that may be reaped
despite potential pitfalls.

I also regret that their moral son|

kept the best as a general guide. Some
parts of the play had to be written
by Shillington because sections of the
original work have been lost or de-

stroyed.
The cast will work with classic
costumes—gowns and masks—and

the set will be kept strictly simple. For
lack of a better word, Kahn describes
the lighting as “psychedilic” and
suggests that strobes will be used ex-
tensively.

The auditions are completely open
and, as usual, people who have never
read before are welcome. Kahn states
that he doesn’t anticipate a long or
difficult rehersal period, with Tranks-
giving vacation interveneing. The
classic will be presented in December
