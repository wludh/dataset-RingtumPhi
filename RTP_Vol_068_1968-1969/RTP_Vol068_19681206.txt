make a decision on buying it “some-
time after Christmas.”

If the library does decide to buy a
reader-printer, it will probably be a
coin operated model. Mr. Needham
explained that a small charge, prob-
ably a quarter, would be required
to make a copy of the microfilm. No
charge would be imposed on_ the
reader part of the operation.

The machine makes negative prints,
since the library used positive micro-
film. However, Mr. Needham states
that the library may buy negative
microfilm from the 3M Corporation
for future use.

The library now has microfilm
copies of the New York Times from
1930, the Current Digest of the
Soviet Press for the past 10 years, and
various archives, among other ma-
terial. There are also two microfilm |
readers now in service. Besides hav-
ing the advantage of being able to|
print microfilm material, “the quality
of reproduction on the reader-printer
is very much better,” Mr. Needham |
adds. |

fed in the two plans presented to the

Pledging

For First

In a Monday night meeting, the |
faculty seemingly reversed its previ-

ous stand on fraternity rush by re-|
jecting three motions asking for de-
ferred rush beginning next year. The |

action was the culmination of debate |
on this issue which dates back to)
November 7, 1966. (See editorial on
Page 2.)

The first motion considered by the
faculty at the meeting pertained to
delaying fraternity rush until after
the freshman year. After much dis-
cussion and debate, it was voted
down.

After further discussion, a motion
to approve the Interfraternity Coun-
cil’s Plan Two was also defeated.
This plan was the one which had
been recommended by the faculty's
executive committee and favored by
the IFC, Plan Two deferred pledging
until mid-semester on a_ three-year-
trial basis with an inactive pledge
period until the second semester. A
1.5 average would have been re-
quired for both inactive and active
pledging while a 2.0 average was
required for initation. Under this plan

’

the IFC felt that financial losses of
the fraternities would have been re-
duced by more than $1000,

The third motion declined by the

faculty asked for fraternity rush to|—

be deferred until after the first |
semester of the freshman year. This
corresponded with IFC Plan One. A
1.5 average would have been requir-
ed for a freshman to become
pledge.

With all of the proposed deferred
rush will be retained. With this under-
standing in mind, the following
resolution was approved by the fac-
ulty:

“It is the sense of the faculty
that the Interfraternity Council give
close attention to ways to eliminate
pledging activities throughout the
first semester.”

The above resolution was contain-

Semester

15, 1966, when the faculty passed an
almost-unanimous resolution which
read:

“Resolved; That the faculty ex-
press to the Interfraternity Coun-
cil its opinion that a program of
deferred rush (delayed pledging)
would benefit the Univeristy edu-
cationally and fraternally.”

At a May I, 1967 faculty meeting
the faculty voted 43-28 to require
the IFC to implement deferred rush
for September of 1968. The partial
text of the faculty resolution was
follows:

as

“Since this faculty prefers that
deferred rush come about by stu-
dent action rather than by faculty
edict the IFC is requested to pre-
sent to the faculty for approval
not later than November 1, 1967,
a plan of deferred rush to become
effective for the school year 1968-
69. An acceptable plan would in-
corporate one of the following pro-
grams: deferred until the end of
the first semester, or deferred until
the end of the Freshman year.”

At the October 2, 1967 faculty
meeting the faculty postponed the

deadline for deferred rush until the
1969-70 session.

IFC | Wins Battle, But...

Monday night’s action by the faculty which kept fraternity
rush in its present state is very perplexing to us. We believe
it may even be perplexing to the faculty. Many of them prob-
ably walked out of the meeting trying to figure out what had
just happened. However, one thing is clear: the question of
deferred rush is not closed.

The faculty’s action Monday night does not preclude
any action in the future. We speculate that debate on this issue
will never really subside and will be brought up again and
again at faculty meetings until it is changed.

There are several reasons for this. First, we have learned
that the votes taken on the deferred rush motions, especially
that which asked for deferral of rush until mid-semester, were
close. In addition, there was not full attendance at the meet-
ing. If those not in attendance were to have voted, the faculty
decision might easily have been reversed.

Secondly, the argument that it is bad to expose freshmen
to the social life of the university before they enter the class-
room will always come to the forefront. There are some faculty
members who feel that there would be more anxiety on the
part of the freshmen if they went through a deferred rush
rather than if they rushed immediately. In the latter case, the
freshmen would just be anxious during the first week of
classes. Of course, students would not even have to go through
this if they were assured that everyone could join a fraternity
or if they were guaranteed practical alternatives to fraternities
(i.e., a student union, mixers with girls’ schools and dormitories
with facilities allowing students to entertain their dates).

Third, the record shows that the grades of this year’s
freshmen through mid-semester are lower than in the past.
Members of the faculty will always be haunted with the fact
that pledging contributes to low grades. If the Interfraternity
Council accepts the faculty resolution to eliminate first semester
pledge activities (which should be done immediately), it will
have to enforce this rule strictly. It will have to do a much
better job than it did last year when pledging activities went
on despite the IFC’s outlawing them through mid-semester.

Fourth, members of the faculty may have a change of
heart. We can only guess their motives for voting the way
they did. Some of the reasons we have heard can easily be
altered if fraternities do anything which disturbs them. Any
wrong step taken by any fraternity during rush or during
the school year will come under the scrutiny of the faculty and
is likely to change everything.

What we are trying to do by relating these speculations is
to show the IFC it is walking on thin ice. The IFC may have
won a battle but its position is tenuous. We strongly recom-
mend that the IFC continue to formulate plans for an effective
deferred rush. The IFC may feel that a problem does not
exist since the faculty voted in its favor. However, the short-
comings of the present system are still with us. With this in
mind, we can be certain future changes will be called for by
the faculty.

We believe, and we think the faculty does also, that the
initiative for reforms should come from the IFC itself. The
IFC should legislate improvements for fraternity rush, not
the faculty.

Lynwood Pullen 1907-1968

Lynwood Pullen will be missed. No longer will he sit
behind the linotype machine setting copy for the Ring-tum
Phi. No longer will he be standing behind the stone composing
the paper, listening to our gripes and giving advice.

In the 17 years that Lynwood worked at the Journalism
Laboratory he came in contact with many students and im-
mediately became their friend. In the three and a half years
we knew Lynwood, we were never conscious of a generation
gap between us and him. He tried to understand our desires |
and goals. Even when he did not agree with us he would’
reason with us rather than intimidate us.

The Ring-tum Phi may not look different in the weeks
to come. The format and content may be the same. But we
will always know something is missing.

Deferred Rush: Two Points of View

“A Trivial Resolution”

By RON KESSLER

The faculty’s recent action, (or
more appropriately their inaction) in
withdrawing their demand for de-
ferred rush is deplorable, cowardly,
and hypocritical; aside from all of
this, it doesn’t make any sense.

The history of deferred rush on
this campus helps explain the above
assertions.

In 1961, the faculty overwhelm-
ingly defeated a proposal of one of
its members to force the fraternities
into a deferred rush situation.

Five years later, the faculty nearly
unanimously passed a resolution stat-
ing, “Resolved, that the faculty ex-

press to the Interfraternity Council
its opinion that a program of de-
ferred rush would benefit the Uni-
versity both educationally and fra-
ternally.”

The IFC, in true form, panicked,
and spent several months evading
the issue at hand. On | May 1967,
the faculty issued a second resolution,
stating:

“This faculty commends the IFC
for its study of pledging activities
and for its action in the matter
fining several houses for hazing.”
However, these changes are not a
satisfactory response to the resolu-
tion of the faculty of November,

1966.

“Since this faculty prefers that

 

deferred rush come about by stu-
dent action rather than by faculty
edict the IFC is requested to pre-
sent to the faculty for approval
not latter than November 1, 1967
a plan of deferred rush to become
effective for the school year 1968-
1969. An acceptable plan would
incorporate one of the following
programs: deferral until the end of
the first semester, or deferral until
the end of the freshman year.” The
resolution passed, 43-28.

At the meeting that passed this
resolution, Dr. Edward L. Pinney as-
serted that deferred rush is “a
minimal condition under which fra-
ternities might continue to enjoy some
tenure at Washington and Lee.” This
Statement appeared to summarize the
feelings of the majority of the fac-
ulty.

 

rush freshmen be permitted to bring
cars to school,

5. “... anxiety should not be over-
whelmingly great in a leisurely at-
mosphere of delayed pledging, and
tension due to attemtped ‘false faces’
should die after a short period.
Neither fraternities nor individual
freshmen could hope to maintain
facades for two or three months” or
longer (Source: R-t P—16 December
1968).

The present system of early rush
essentially gives freshmen the alterna-
tives of “which fraternity.” A system
of deferred rush would add an addi-
tional alternative, one of “whether or
not fraternity.” Each freshman de-
serves this additional choice. It is ob-
vious that the Interfraternity Council
will not of its own accord introduce
deferred rush. It is up to the faculty

to again reverse its decision; this
would be an act in the best interests
of the students, in spite of the
students.

 

 

Later, the faculty gave the IFC a|
one year extension on deferred rush |
since the Student Union would not |

be finished until 1969; it was felt
that the Student Union would pro-
vide the social outlet freshmen would
lose by not having early rush.

The IFC, after innumerable polls,
complaints, petitions, requests, groans,
moans, et al, ad nauseum finally got
down to business and presented two
plans to the faculty, one of which
was recommended to the faculty by
the faculty executive committee. This
plan, however, was rejected Monday
night by the faculty along with two
other plans for deferred rush.

Meaningless Resolution

The only accepting the faculty did
on Monday was to endorse a mean-
ingless and trivial resolution stating,
“It is the sense of the faculty that
the Interfraternity Council give close
attention to ways to eliminate pledg
ing activities throughout the first
semester,”

Objections to deferred rush have
been raised by the IFC since 1966
Essentially, they follow this line:

1. Fraternities would fold due to
the lack of funds the freshmen usually
provide.

2. “Dirty rush” would increase

3, Freshman-upperclass communi-
cations would cease to exist.

4, Freshmen would have no social
life

5. Fraternity tension and freshman
anxiety would be prolonged

Answers to these objections can
easily be provided,

1, Fraternity expenditures can be
decreased, Social budgets, on the aver
age of $5,000 per year per house
could be cut first semester and in-
creased second semester. Fraterni
ties would save $8,000 to $10,000
per year on rush book expenses, A
rushee fee could be charged and
turned over to the fraternities to help

“Overjoyous!

By CLARK CARTER
IFC President

Since November 7, 1966, when the
first resolution passed the faculty ask-
ing the IFC to prepare a plan for
deferred rush, fraternity men have
been forced to stand back and take
a long introspective look at the pres-
ent rushing system and the possibili-
ties for an alternative. For a multi-
plicity of reasons the vast majority
of fraternities considered the present
pre-school rush the best for all con-
cerned; however, by being forced to
devise rushing plans which embodied
various deferral periods, fraternity
men have viewed every angle of rush-
ing. In short, anticipating deferred
rush has had a broadening effect on
fraternities. Both strong and weak
points have been noted in the present
rush.

When the faculty decided Monday
night to allow rushing as it is pres-
ently is done, nearly all fraternity
men were Overjoyously satisfied. But

Philharmonia Interprets

The Philharmonia Trio’s perform-

was & most fitting opening of the

with sounds of uninhibited, dynamic
and brilliant playing

made by Stradivarious. The violin
(1737) is the last instrument the great
violin maker created. Charles Libove

that these instruments had to offer.
Had it not been for the superb
playing of Nina Lugovoy and her
sensitive manner of interpreting the
intentions of the composers of the
music without masking the sounds of

| the violin and cello, this trio of per-

formers would have sounded as un-
balanced as others we have heard in
Lee Chapel.

From the opening of the Mozart
trio in E Major, K. 542, it was
evident that the audience would ex-
perience some great music making.
This trio is one of three composed in
1788 when Mozart was 32. During
the summer of that year he also
composed three of his greatest sym-
phonies, including the “Jupiter.” The
music of the E Major trio abounds
with beautiful melodies and intriguing
dynamic coloring and was performed
to perfection by the trio.

fraternities must not regard the fac-
ulty’s decision as some sort of re-
sounding victory for student power,
as it were. What must not be over-
looked is the recommendation in their
resolution to defer pledging activities
until after the first semester. I be-
lieve this to be a responsible and
wise suggestion on the faculty’s be-
half.

It is my hope that their recom-
mendations will be met with the same
responsibility that the deferred rush
resolution received.

After the long and extensive evalua-
tion of rushing and pledging by the
IFC, I hope that most fraternity men
will see the positive aspects of a de-
ferred pledging period. During the
first semester freshmen as pledges
should be allowed to attend parties,
utilize all of the house’s facilities,
and participate in intramural athletics.
The houses, on the other hand, would
not require anything whatsoever from
the pledges other than payment of
the house bills. This arrangement for
the first semester would solve at least
one weak point of pre-school rush;
the freshman would be able to estab-
lish a firm academic grounding with-
out having fraternities competing with
professors for his time. A much need-
ed by-product would be the shorten-
ing and lessening of the artificial
humiliation period known as pledge
training which still lingers somewhat.

I foresee the passage of such a
reform in the present system as an
opportunity for the IFC to prove it-
self again a responsible and sensitive
body.

UFOCC Collects
Needed Clothes;
Service Planned

The United Federation of Christian
Concern Clothing Drive, held sev-
eral weeks ago for the benefit of
the Rockbridge County Welfare
Office, surpassed all expectations and
exceeded last year’s record collection.
John Crockett and Gil Frank, who
directed the effort, were aided to a
large extent in distribution and col-
lection by the Circle K Club.

The drive was expanded this year
to include several area churches. Fra-
ternity participation was considerably
improved over last year, while the
faculty box in front of Washington
Hall reaped its usual large quantity.

An estimated 300 to 400 pounds
of clothing was finally amassed.
Crockett summed up the drive by
stating, “All in all, the response
was extremely good. The quality, as
well as the quantity, ran unusually
high, and practically all the material
collected will prove useful to Lex-
ington’s needy,”

Candlelight Service

On December 18 the United Fed-
eration of Christian Concern will
sponsor the annual Candlelight Ser-
vice. Open to both the Lexington
community as well as the University
community, the service will be held
in the R. E. Lee Memorial Episcopal
Church, rather than Lee Chapel. This
change in location will not only pro-
vide additional seating but also will
allow the use of actual candles.

Coordinating this year's Yuletime
event is the responsibility of Bob
Bigham and Chip Harris. The pro-

Fechnay & Mitchell
Chosen All-State

Washington and Lee’s two out-
standing soccer players, Scot Fechnay
and Thom Mitchell have been chosen
as members of the Virginia All-State
Soccer team.

Both Fechnay and Mitchell are
Delt seniors, both were co-captains
this year and both hail from the
North. Fechnay lives in Mountain
Lakes, New Jersey, and Mitchell is
from Middletown, New York.

Fechnay was Coach Joe Lyles’ lead-
ing scorer as center-forward for the
last three years (he was also a stand-
out his freshman year) and conse-
quently is being named to his third
All-State first team.

Mitchell did not play soccer his

 

freshman year. Beginning with his
sophomore year, he was the mainstay
in front of the Generals’ goal—always
looking good, often spectacular, in
blocking shots. Because of his fine
performance in each of the past two
years, he has been selected honorable
mention as goalie on the All-State
team.

Their coach, Joe Lyles, calls them
“two of the finest soccer players I
have ever had the pleasure of coach-
ing. I, personally, and the entire
soccer program will certainly miss
them, as players of their ability, atti-
tude and sportsmanship come along
once in a great while. We were for-
tunate to have had two such boys at
Washington and Lee.”

 

With Intramurals

By THUNDER THORTON

The intramural season moves in-
doors for the winter months with
competition in bowling, handball and
table tennis.

The bowling season runs from
November to February 11, with the
finals set for February 12. Handball
runs from December 3 until Febru-
ary 11. Table tennis will follow the
same schedule. Championships in
both sports are set for the evening
of February 14 and 17.

Before the Thanksgiving holidays
the football championship was de-
cided in a three-way sudden death
playoff between the Phi Gams, SAEs

and Phi Delts, all of whom had
identical 2-1 records in the regular
playoffs,

The SAEs won the first game, beat-
ing the Phi Delts and earned a
berth in the deciding game against
the Phi Gams, who drew a bye.
However ,the final game was a fre-
peat of the previous Phi Gam-SAE
matchup, with the Phi Gams winning
big and cornering the trophy with a

25-7 victory. The final results gave
the Phi Delts third and the Phi Kaps
fourth.

A pre-Thanksgiving meeting of the
fraternity athletic directors produced
some important business. A decision
was made to allow the Law School
to return to the intramural program
on a probationary basis. Any further
misdemeanors would result in a perm-
anent expulsion. Bart Taylor, student
intramural director, commended the
fraternities for their inceasing par-
ticipation in the program, an in-
crease reflected by the total participa-
tion points earned by the houses, a
total that exceeds by over 300 points
last year’s total at this time.

The new interest is also reflected
in a tight race for the intramural
point lead. Before the swimming meet
last month, only eight points separat-
ed the first five fraternities. SPE was
leading, followed by the Phi Delts,
Betas, Sigma Chis and Phi Kaps. The
football totals will put the Phi Delts
into first.

Taylor said that to add interest
to the intramurals an All-IM football
team will be selected from the mem-
bers of the four finalists. He also
said there will be similar all-star
teams selected for other sports in
the winter and spring.

 

Winter Teams

Then Run by Bridgewater

Washington and Lee’s basketball
team opened its 1968 season on a
less than enthusiastic note Monday
night as the ylost to Randolph-Macon,
78-71. The game was perhaps closer
than the score may indicate—at least
for three quarters of the game.

The game opened slowly as both
teams were feeling each other out
while at the same time trying to
smooth out their own systems under
actual game situations for the nitial
time in 1968.

Midway through the first half the
Tigers opened up a slight lead but
just before the half ended they saw
their lead wittlhed away by a de-
termine group of Generals. At the
buzzer the Generals had managed
to grab the lead—by a single point.

Beginning early in the second half
the game began to take on the look
of a down-to-the-wire finish as the
two teams stayed close to each other.
Then with about ten minutes left
in the game and W&L still holding
its one point lead, there came a five
minute period which changed the en-
tire complexion of the game.

Suddenly the Generals couldn't
manage to hold on to the ball.
Randolph-Macon capitalized on turn-
over after turnover by W&L to wipe
out the Generals lead and build a big
lead for themselves.

With five minutes left in the game
and the Tigers holding a big lead,
the Generals regrouped and began
playing good basketball again. But
even their full-court press which
brough them the last seven points of
the game was unable to overcome the
Tigers insurmountable lead and the
Generals tasted defeat in Doremus
Gym for the first time in 24 games.
Also maintained was the Tigers’ jinx
over W&L which now stretches back
for nine years.

Bright spots for W&L were four
Generals who placed in double
figures. Mike Neer paced the Generals
with 18 points, followed by Stu
Fauber’s 16, Norwood Morrison's 13,
and Mike Daniels’ 13. Daniels, only
a freshman, came off the bench in
scoring his 13 and was very impres-
sive.

The Generals equaled the rebound-
ing total of Randolph-Macon—each
pulled down 46, Neer aagin paced the
Generals with 13 rebounds and Mel
Cartwright grabbed 11. One factor
which certainly hurt the Generals was

to Macon

Mel Cartwright’s badly sprained ankle
which severly restricted his play. He
only managed 8 points.

On Wednesday the Generals took
the floor at Doremus once again—

determined to start a new home
winning streak. With both Cart-
wright’s ankle and the Generals’

poise much improved, W&L romped
to victory over Bridgewater by the
lopsided score of 94-63.

Bridgewater having scouted the
Generals, opened with a press—hop-
ing to force Generals turnovers that
had come so readily in their first
game. But it was a calmer General
team and after the first 13 minutes
the Generals held a slim lead. Then
Daniels came off the bench to score
two quick baskets and the Generals
were off to the races.

The W&L spurted to a command-
ing lead at halftime and turned the
game into a rout in the second
half. Neer again paced the Generals
in scoring and rebounding—getting
26 points and 15 rebounds, Cart-
wright was once again playing like
the Cartwright of old and netted 23
points and grabbed 8 rebounds. Stu
Farber and Bill Rhyne each chipped
in with 10 points to again give W&L
four players in double figures. The
Generals also won the rebounding
battle 48-36.

Freshmen Lose

Washington and Lee's freshmen
basketball team opened its season
Monday night against Randolph-
Macon’s freshman team, However the
freshmen suffered the same fate as
the varsity—a loss. Rob Faust and

Scot Wood looked good in the 71-56

Tankmen Meet
American U.

This year finds swimming coach
Bill Stearns optimistic about the com-
ing season. “This is one of the best
teams we've had in quite a few years
here. They are a group of extremely
dedicated individuals that I'm happy
to be able to work with. They've
responded well to hard work.”

Part of the reason Coach Stearns
is optimistic is because of the re-
turn of co-captain Billy Ball, who
just missed being an All-American
last year. The other co-captain is
Ross Foreman, who is expected to
be strong in the freestyle.

Other top natators include juniors
Cal Cameron, Dave Kympton, and
sophomore Scott McElroy. Roger
Martin has rejoined the team after
a year’s absense and will provide
depth in sprints and the backstroke.

Perhaps Coach Sterans brightest
hope is freshman John Lawlor, who
has already set a school record in
practice and is expected to add a
couple of more. Another freshman
expected to see action is Klein Stuart,
who will swim the breast stroke.

Last week they put a practice meet
under their belts by competing against
VMI. The event was pleasing to
Stearns because of the practice in a
25 yard pool and because of some
of the surprising performances by the
W&L tankmen.

Things start for real today at 4
p.m. in Doremus Gymnasium when
the swimmers entertain American
University of Washington, D.C. W&L
has not been able to beat them for
several years. Monday WA&l will
entertain Roanoke College.

Other top teams on the Generals’
schedule include Catholic Univeristy
of Washington, D. C., whom W&L
has not defeated in four years, and
such highly subsidized teams as U.Va.,
Penn State, and West Virginia.

Towson State

Wrestling coach Dick Miller usu-
ally whistles while he works, but
when asked about his team’s pros-

pects he delivers one of his own
compositions: “Whistling in the
Dark.”

That’s because Miller has the same
old problem of late: lack of depth
and inexperience. He’s relying on
youth to help him change his tune.

The lower weight classes, always
a problem for the Generals, are be-
ing filled with freshmen candidates.
Co-captain Razz Rasberry, a 130-
pounder, is the only veteran in the
lower weights.

Junior Dave Higgins holds down
the 152-pound slot, and everyone is
waiting for senior co-captain Jay
Clarke to pare his 190 football
pounds down to help in the 160 to
167 wrestling range.

Clark Carter, Dan Webster and
John (Dee) Copenhaver round out the
weight classes and all have mat ex-
perience. But from there Coach
Miller starts puckering up.

The first test for the W&L wrestl-
ers will be a severe one as the Gen-
erals open their season tonight
against Towson State in an 8 p.m.
home match at Doremus Gym.

Other matches will be against such
schools as North Carolina, Loyola,
Virginia Commonwealth, Western
Maryland and North Carolina.
