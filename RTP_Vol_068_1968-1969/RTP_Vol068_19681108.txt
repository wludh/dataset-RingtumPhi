entitled “Saturday's Child” will air

| of contemporary folk rock and under-

beginning at 2:55 EST.

The program's composition and
percentage (25%) of total broadcast-
ing reflects the station’s attempt to
jappeal to the great diversity in the
musical interests of its listening audi-
lence. Such a diversity from

Mr. Winston believed that many stu-
dents might adopt this attitude toward
the station,

Yet maintaining a staff ranging
from 45-50 students is no problem.
In addition the listening radios (with
a strong signal) range from two to
three miles and the station has been
heard as far away as six or seven
miles, a considerable distance for such
a low output. At least 340 persons
are now included on WLUR’s mail-
ing list, and Mr. Winston hopes to
have a December survey to determine
the listening audience. As well, the
wattage of the station imposes no
required number of air hours and
consequently the station is free to
broadcast much or as little as it
feels necessary

Concert Guild to Present
Piano Recital Wednesday

Richard Goode, _ internationally
known concert pianist, is scheduled

to perform Tuesday at 8 p.m. in
Lee Chapel.
Goode, who has been called “a

brilliant young pianist,” has already |
performed major concert recitals in
New York, under the presentation of
the Young Concert Artists Series, and
has played in the Festival of the
Iwo Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, for
the past two seasons. On this conti-|

nent he has soloed with major
orchestras in the United States,
Canada, and Mexico.

FROGS to Meet
At Thompson’s

The Friends and Relatives of Gil-
ber and Sullivan, otherwise known as
the FROGS, will meet tonight
discuss plans for this year’s perform-
ance.

Dr. J. B. Thompson, president of
the organization, will host the meet-
ing at 8:30 p.m. in his home at 103
Rebel Ridge Drive. All interested per-
sons are welcome.

The main issue to be decided there
is the question of whether the FROGS
should restrict themselves only to
operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan or
instead diversify and include the
works of other composers.

Those favoring Gilbert and Sulli-
van are trying to decide on which of
their operettas to do. “The Gondol-
iers” and “Ruddigore” are the lead-
ing contenders for the performance
which will take place sometime in
either March or April.

The FROGS is a loose organiza-
tion of area citizens and students
whose one unifying factor is their
love of the operettas of Gilbert and
Sullivan. The entire show is a vol-
untary effort and is financed by the
Lexington Kiwanis Club

rhe proceeds from the production
go to the Kiwanis Club’s Scholarship
Fund for area high school students

This year's production will mark
the sixth annual performance of the

to

FROGS. In the past five years they

have produced “H.M.S. Pinafore,

Goode studied with Rudolph Serkin
at the Curtis Institute of Music be-
fore beginning his worldwide tours.

Newspapers critics have been over-
whelming in their praise of Goode.

The Washington Post commented,
“Goode plays with facile dexterity
and with a fine sense of coloration
and balance. He produced sounds
that brought the piano into its truly
great light. I have never heard it

sound so beautiful.” The Mexico City
El Nacional, reviewing his perform-

ance with their symphony, wrote,
“From the first notes the audience
knew it was in the presence of an

extraordinary musician and an extra-
ordinary pianist.”

The program for the evening will
consist of Bach’s Patria No. 1, in
B-flat Major; Beethoven's Sonata in
in E Major, opus 109; Debussy’s Five
Preludes; Le Loriot by Messiaen; and
Chopin's Polonaise Fantasy, opus 61.

Admission for students and faculty
and others may purchase
tickets at the door. This concert
the fivsi for the 1968-69 Concert
Guild Season.

Goode praise from The Lon
don Times, which said, “He already
possesses the qualities which go to
the making of an outstanding inter-
preter—a natural musicianship, imagi
nation, keen intelligence, and an ac
complished technique.”

WLU R | Reaching Potential

By its activities this week, we can readily see that WLUR-
FM, Washington and Lee University’s radio station, is on the
way toward maximizing its potential as a public servant.

Under the direction of Mr. Charles E. Winston, the sta-
tion manager, WLUR-FM will expand its programming to
seven days a week when it begins regular Saturday broadcast-
ing tomorrow. This means that the station will broadcast from
7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday through Friday and from 1 p.m. to
9 p.m. on Saturday.

We were particularly impressed with the election coverage
the station broadcast Tuesday night. Any small, unafhiliated
radio station could have taken the easy way out on election
night by just giving basic returns and then falling back on
music. WLUR approached the elections from a solid informa-
tional viewpoint, never falling back on light entertainment.

Beginning at 7 p.m., 32 students began broadcasting the
election returns, which were simultaneously heard over the
Lexington station WREL. This hard corps of workers, organiz-
ed by Clark Goodwin, included political science majors, his-
tory majors and others—not just radio people. They pre-
sented in-depth analyses to the bizarre events of Tuesday
evening as they were reported over the wire dispatches.

To bolster the information coming over the national news
wires, WLUR had students stationed around the state and
in Washington, D.C. to telephone in with hourly reports.
The students phoning in from Washington, D.C. were located
at both national party headquarters and were able to get com-
ments from some of the party leaders.

The election broadcasting ended at 3:53 a.m. much to
the dislike of the broadcasters. However, it was evident nothing
would be resolved until morning.

Tomorrow WLUR will cover live from Memphis the foot-
ball game between W&L and Southwestern. At least 10 stu-
dents will be involved in this broadcast, which will include
pre-game and post-game programs. When the station signs
off tomorrow night it will have been on the air for 37 hours
this week.

Now in its third year, WLUR-FM is beginning to serve its
purpose in presenting full coverage for all public affairs and
for providing entertainment for the tastes of the students,
faculty and community. A bi-weekly newspaper like the Ring-
tum Phi cannot possibly give full coverage to all events. The
radio station will now help us to keep you informed.

Vurnax Is a Real Fan

While we’ re in a laudatory mood, we must praise the efforts
of Mr. Peter Vurnax, manager of Evans Dining Hall, for his
extreme interest in the varsity football team.

In this age of unsubsidized athletics at Washington and
Lee, there are no rewards given to football players for out-
standing performances. In most cases their achievements go
unnoticed. Wednesday night, Mr. Vurnax rewarded the team
for its upset against Sewanee by giving the players a steak
dinner.

There is no way to determine if “Acting-coach” Vurnax’s
efforts to spur the team on with the added incentive of a
steak dinner was the deciding factor in Saturday's game.
But we do know that the team recognizes that it has at least
one faithful fan and will try its best to win for him, as well
as for the school.

With fans like Mr. Vurnax, how can you lose?

A Concerned Reply

We read with some concern the comment made by a set
of “Concerned Parents” in the “Letters to the Editor’ section
of this issue on the IFC resolution to permit girls into the
upper floors of the dormitories and fraternities. The objection
these parents make is that their son and other students like
him would be subject to a . strain on self-discipline and
restraint...” if this rule were relaxed.

These parents feel that the temptations involved when
students are confronted with a “ripe’’ situation would be harm-
ful to college students who they feel are not mature
enough to be given complete freedom.”

In essence, these parents are stating that they feel students
are not capable ot defining for themselves the difference be-
tween right and wrong and that they need some guidelines
to direct them in their uncertainty.

Yet, we feel this moral crisis that these parents wish to
prevent is going to manifest itself in other ways. The difference
is in place, not in kind, The kind of temptation facing a stu-
dent in the back seat of an automobile is no different than
that in the seemingly iniquitous “upper rooms” of their fra
ternity house. The kind ot temptation a student contronts
by having a bottle of liquor out at a fraternity brother's apart-
ment is no different from having it in his room
A college education is not just the critical thinking one

Library Archives Sorted

One of the many projects begun
since the installation of Mr. Maurice
Leach as librarian is the sorting and
arranging of material collectively
grouped under the rather obscure
classification of “Archives and Rare
Books.” Under the direction of Mrs.
Henry Sloss, the project initially got
underway about a month and a half
ago and no immediate end is fore-
seen,

The material represents a wide
variety of valuable works and papers
given to the University over the
years. The collection includes papers
by such historic men as George Wash-
ington, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick
Henry, John Hancock, James Monroe,
Robert E. Lee and “Light Horse
Harry” Lee.

Works from three or four literary
societies are included in the archives.

These societies were either directly
connected with the University, of
indirectly connected by their loca

tion in Lexington. Valley newspapers
dating back to the 1700's trace the
history of the Shenandoah up to the
present. The earliest land grant of
the surrounding area has been in-
cluded as well as several indentures.

The early Byrd papers, represent
ing one of Virginia's first families,
are contained in the collection along
with several papers dealing with

Already the process of organiza-

documents of the Confederacy which
had been hidden since their arrival.
As the house cleaning continues other
papers may be discovered.

Mr. Leach pointed out the increas-
ed national interest the library has
received in accumulating the entire
collection of papers and letters on
important historical figures. Only re-
cently, the library has received re-
quests to view the Calhoun papers
and all documents pertaining to the

Off Weekend Road Trip
Leads to Capitol Hill —

Cal Whitehurst, a Delta Upsilonyness of the present Democratic ad

sophomore from Norfolk, Va., had
an unusual “weekend” this past week.
He went home to hear the election
returns, which sounds like a fairly
dry thing to do to liven up an off
weekend, except that the election
returns were for his father,

Dr. George W. Whitehurst was the
Republican candidate for U. $8, Con-
gress from the 2nd District, the Nor-
folk and Portsmouth area. When all
the votes were tallied Tuesday night,
Cal discovered that he had a Con-
gressman for a father, for Dr.
Whitehurst won the race, polling
more than 8,000 votes than his Demo-
ocratic Opponent.

A member of W&L’s graduating
class in 1950, Dr. Whitehurst was a
history major and president of D.U.
He went on to get his masters in
history at the University of Virginia
in 1961. That same year he became
a professor of history at Old Do-
minion College, where he is now
Dean of Students. After obtaining his
Ph.D. in 1960 at West Virginia Uni-
versity, he began a series of trips
to Europe in which he interviewed
dignitaries of various countries.

When Porter Hardy, the Demo-
cratic Congressman for his district,
retired in March of this year, Dr.
Whitehurst was asked to run for the
vacant seat by the district's Republi-
can committee. Campaigning began
in early September. Dr. Whitehurst
spoke “anywhere and everywhere be-
fore the election,” according to Cal.
Often Dr. Whitehurst debated issues
before groups with his opponent,
Fredrick T. “Bingo” Stant. The focus

 

of the debates was on the effective-

ge

 

ministraion, the ability of each to
obtain appropriations from Congress,
and the origin of each condidate’s
campaign funds.

[he night of the election, Cal and
“staff, friends, family, and interested
guests” gathered in a conference room
of a local motel to await the results.

The returns came in slowly dur-
ing the night. All the reports were
received from the Norfolk city hall
where one of Dr. Whitehurst’s
campaign managers was stationed,
Several times in the evening it ap-
peared that Dr. Whitehurst was going
to fall behind his opponent, but about
10:00, it appeared he would win.

Cal related that “all we could do
was wait. I just stood around watch-
ing the returns coming in, and oc-
casionally snatching my mother’s
drink out of her hand when photo-
graphers were taking pictures of her.”
By 11:00 Mr. Stant conceded the
election, and Dr, Whitehurst made
his victory speech. Cal recalled that
several members of the staff were
“wandering around singing calypso
songs afterward in celebration.”

Perhaps the most unusual part of
the election for Cal was when a
local newspaper photographer came
to take pictures of Dr. Whitehurst’s
son arriving home for the election.
“He couldn't decide on what sort of
picture to take and finally gave up
and took one of my mother and me
looking into my laundry bag.”

Cal’s father will be sworn in as
a Congressman on January 3, 1969,
As for Cal's reaction to the election,
he remarked, “At least this comes
only once every two years.”

Generals Try For Third Straight

 

fo bolster the morale of W&L’s
football team, Coach Leslie has ap-
proved the re-designing of cheerlead
ers costumes. These cheerleaders will

be taken along with the team to
Memphis this week in hopes that
their efforts will aid the Generals

to capture their third straight victory

Disclosing the importance of the
revamping of costumes, Coach Les
lie that the cheerleaders will
serve to distract the Southwestern
squad at crucial moments during the
game.

Against this formidable opposition,
the Generals will pit their new-found
offensive and defensive muscles—both
of which played well against a power-
ful Sewanee team. The defense held }
the Tigers to 200 yards total defense,
well below their average total, which |
ranked them fourth among small col-
leges before last week’s game.

Ihe rebirth of the General offense
can be noted in the latest conference
statistics. Joe Dozier ranks fifth in

passing, but is also found among the
leading rushers.

Flanker Buck Cunningham is lead

does in the classroom. It is his whole experience. He gains
this experience through his academic, athletic and social life.
Most students recognize that they will be confronted with
situations that test their standards of morals, and they welcome
these tests. If they are to develop and change their standards,
it is because they, themselves have made the decisions, not
someone else.

We feel that if the student is to be given a realistic social
life, one that recognizes that the arena of testing and experi-
mentation is within the student’s mind and not in the ritulalistic
spectre of a bedroom hovering over him, the student will
become a better educated, more morally sound man. The dif-
ference is in place, not in kind.

such as tomorrow's Southwestern
game from Memphis. The broadcast-
ing is simply a “long-distance tele-
phone call” but with no telephones!
Instead a microphone is plugged into
an amplifier leading to a closed tele-
phone circuit in the press box in
Memphis which folows the telephone
lines to Roanoke and then is re-
layed to Lexington and finally the
WLUR studio. All this happens to
cost ten cents per air mile per hour,
and since Memphis is about 410 air
miles from Lexington, that two-and-
a-half hour call runs about $100. In
fact the trip, all totaled will run at
least $350 for this game alone.
