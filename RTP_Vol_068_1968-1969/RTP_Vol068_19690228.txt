Dwelling Shortage Chronic

Housing Is The Problem

By WALT JACKSON

Students who have looked for an apartment to rent know
that it is not easy to find one. The problem of housing, how-
ever, is much more serious for the low-income families of
Lexington.

In an article on this page Ted DeLaney charges that Vir-
ginia Military Institute has aggravated the problem by acquir-
ing land in a poor, low income neighborhood south of Main
Street (see diagonally lined area on map). For several years
VMI has had a policy of gradually buying land as it comes
on the market. The school plans eventually to expand into the
area and now owns 18 of the 63 parcels in the sector. Much
of the land is rental property though there are some home-
owners.

Col. J. Carter Hanes, who directs VMI's development
program, claims that the institute, bordered by W&L on
the west and by a river on the north, has nowhere else to
expand. VMI, he says, has allowed tenants to remain in their
houses rent-free for up to three months after the house has
been sold. Asked if VMI has made any attempt to relocate

 

these people, he replied. “They are finding places on their |
dwellings are inadequate.

own, I presume.”

Many of the residents have experienced problems in find-
ing these places. Last year seven families were forced to move
when VMI acquired their dwellings in an estate. The only
homes some could find were in the county, away from their
community and from shopping areas.

About four years ago Col. Hanes attempted to persuade
the city of Lexington to apply for an urban renewal project
in which federal funds would be available for planning and
for relocation of displaced families. The city government de-

In the days of the silent movie,

The silent movie is a thing of the

landlord lives on in the person of

28 houses with inadequate plumb-

hot water supply.

The information above. as stated.
concerns itself only with dwellings
located within the illustrated area.
There are many more such areas, al-

though not nearly as large or as
condensed as the one in question.
The U. S. Bureau of Housing in

1960 lists 1.959 housing units in Lex-
ingion. Of this total, 338 were con
sidered by the federal government to
be deteriorating and 161 to be di-
lupidated.

Many of these. particularily those
situated on the fringes of Lexington,
are worse off, lacking many of the
benefits that are present within the
city proper. Water, for example, for
many of these people, poses a very
real and perplexing problem. Piped
water in these areas is ofien a luxury.
Many are forced to transport water
to their places of residence. and there
is evidence that some are actually
drinking drain water collected from
highway runoff. Government officials
have taken samples of many of the
present sources of water and have
informed these people that much of
it is not fit for human consumption
it is one thing to inform those in
question that their water is con-
taminated: it is quite another to pro
vide them with an alternative source

A responsible spokesman of the
South Main community—one who
was born and raised there-—com-
menied that the situation is “de

teriorating.” Whether or not the re-
sponsibility of rectifying this situation
lies in the realm of city government,

meni is offen in quesiion. There has

A View From The Other Side Of Main

An Editorial

Walk On The Other Side

Where is the other side of Lexington?

Look across the street and you'll see it.

Who lives on the other side of Lexington?
Look around you and you'll see its inhabitants.

Here we are—students at Washington and Lee, the home
of the Southern Gentleman. We live on the prosperous side
of the street, in which we pay a comprehensive tuition fee of
$1900 a year to get an education. According to Dean of Ad-
missions, James D. Farrar, each one of us can expect to spend
$3400 a year at W&L. (This figure includes tuition, food,
board, books, entertainment and miscellaneous expenses.) This
is astronomical when we consider that the average worker in
Lexington and Glasgow earns from $3000-$5000 a year (ac-
cording to Miss Sharon Henderson, secretary of the Rock-
bridge Area Community Action Program).

We believe that every Washington and Lee student should
walk into the areas on the other side of the street at least
once in the four years he is here. What he will see be poverty,
unhappiness, inadequate facilities and lack of opportunity.
In other words, he will be walking right in the middle of slums
occupied by both white and black families—all this directly
across the street from a “rich boys’ school” and a state military
school.

We feel as if we have an obligation to society to try to
aid others try to attain the same luxuries we now enjoy. After
all, one of the reasons we are not now in the same position
as those people on the other side of Lexington is chance, i.e.,
we were lucky enough to be the children of parents whose
conditions, for the most part, have not required us to live in
poverty. Granted, we feel we have an obligation to “make
something of ourselves,” to become “successful” and to pay
back in some way those who have invested so much in our
lives. But, we will not consider ourselves successful or feel we
have made the most of our lives by counting the amount of
money we earn. It is true money will be important in raising
our families and living comfortably. However, we can become
rich in another way by helping others.

This is certainly idealistic. But we are still young and
relatively carefree. Now is the time for us to have ideals.
What we fear is that too many W&L students have lost their
ideals. We fear that too many W&L students are set in their
ways, acting and thinking like 30 year-old men. We fear that
Wa&lL men, who have so much to offer to others, are solely
concerned with themselves. This self-interest, which often ex-
hibits itself as selfishness, has blinded many of us to the needs
of others. This in itself is the main reason for apathy on
campus. It’s not lack of time; it’s lack of interest in others.

Therefore, we would like to challenge you, as Kirk Wood-
ward did in Tuesday’s Ring-tum Phi. We ask you to expand
your view of yourself to discover the world around you,
Begin in Lexington. The problems in Lexington are similar
to those of all cities in the world. People here need help, and
we are in an excellent position to help them.

rhe poor of Lexington do not ask us for money, They
ask us for our time and our understanding. One group which
has ipproached us to ask for student aid is the Rox kbridge
Area Community Action Program. This organization was
established to help the local poor achieve better working condi-
tions. The members of this group help the workers band
together to dispel the fear they have to speak up for better
working conditions, which in many places are atrocious.

The Rockbridge Area Community Action Program is just
one of many roups composed of blacks and whites, poor and
middle class, who are working to to make Lexington a better
place for everyone to live in. (Anyone desiring information on
the Rockbridge Area Community Action Program or any other
groups should contact James H. Smith in Buena Vista.)

Let this be a challenge to all of you. Look at others less
fortunate than you and realize how good you really have it.

Housing Is The Problem

(Continued from Page 2)

The corporation, set up under the
1965 Federal Housing Act and chart-
ered on May 3, 1968, has obtained
an option to buy approximately eight
acres Of land for the purpose of con-
structing the units. The area is bound-
by Lewis Street, Diamond Street
(extended), and the Lexington Bypass,
Route 11A.

Dr. Hodges reported that a survey
taken by the Roanoke-based Total

indicated that there was “severe over-
crowding in at least twenty dwellings,”
and that a number of dilapidated
dwellings exist within the city limits.

According to Dr. Hodges, if the
application is approved, work could

cautioned that the time period seemed
optimistic to him. He anticipates a 9

Dr. Hodges believed the project, if
it goes through, will “loosen up” the
housing situation in Lexington and
force rents down in the community,

tossed out.”

Spring Sports Jump The Gun

Tennis

The W&L tennis team is returning
one of our strongest teams this
spring. Coach Canfield has only the
highest praise for his seven return-
ing lettermen, including Captain Tom
Rueger, seniors Ray Turman and Don
McClure, juniors Tom McJunkin,
Rick Armstrong, and Mike Spoor, and
sophomore Bill Gatlin rounding out
the group. Among these men there
are five Conference champs return-
ing, and the possibility of a third
straight CAC Championship looks ex-
cellent.

Dave Bethea and John Kefauver
will be trying to break into the line-
up, up from last: year’s JV team.
Coach Canfield has not heard of any
new Freshman prospects but feels
there may be a couple around.

This year’s schedule apepars to be
tougher than most in the past with
big-name schools such as Maryland,
Virginia, William & Mary, Duke, and
Bucknell on the list, all of whom
are subsidized. Coach Canfield’s ex

 

planation of this is that his men
would rather play against hard com-
petition than against some of the!

softer small-college competition found |
in the area. It will be tough to better ,
last season's 7-3 record, but Coach |
Canfield is optimistic that this team
can do it if they work as hard as |
they have shown him they can. In|

It is Szlasa’s hope that the practices
will help to mature his young team
as rapidly as possible. Thus the goal
or the February program has been
conditioning in order that the scrim-
mage can be essentially learning ex-

periences rather than conditioning
periods.
Depite a strong nucleus of re-

turning lettermen, the prospects of
the team depend to a great extent on
the speed with which some of the
freshmen and untested upperclassmen
develop. The defense, anchored by
goalie Pete Nowick and co-captain
Charlie Stewart, is the area in which
competition is greatest. Returning let-
termen Ned Coslett and Tom Mul-
lenix are a strong unit by boys
like Frank Stearns and Bob Radcliffe,
up from last year’s “B” squad, and
freshman Tommy Smith are present-
ing a strong challenge. At midfield
there is not much depth. Upperclass-
men Whit Morrill, co-captain Bart
Goodwin, Tom Robson, and Rocky
Kimball are receiving help from a
group of freshmen that includes Scott
Neese, Jim McKane, Tim Criss, and
fodd Morrill. The attack, weakened
by the graduation of Chip Chew and

 

Tom Pittman, is working expecially
hard to develop into a smooth and
cohesive unit. Lettermen Tom Groton,
Joe Wich, and Dick Capron, backed ;
Craig Galpern, will supply the
nucleus with help from freshmen and
last year’s “B” squad.

Track

The WAL track team will hold a
meeting for all interested persons
on Monday at 2:00 in the projection
room upstairs in the gym. Coach
Walden is hopeful of a large turnout
because of the lack of depth present
at the time. There are a large num-
ber of returnees, however, but mostly
spread oul over many events, with
fewer than two men returning in most
events. The sprints boast the return

 

best one we have.

The depth of the team is still

in question however, and the outcome |

will be seen only when practice form

VMI during the winer, Coach Walden
reports, but that not enough people

Baseball

This year’s baseball squad should
be one of the most versatile squads
W&L has seen in a long time. With
a little more age and experience than
usual, the baseball team is confident
it will better the 8-10 record of last
year. Last year’s record was the best
since 1961, and with very few losses
form last year’s squad, experience
and versatility are our key hopes.
The only losses from last year’s squad
were Captain Bill Rasmussen, and
freshman pitcher John Botcheller who
transferred to NYU,

The corps of returnees is led by
co-captains Jim Wilson and Thom
Mitchell, both seniors. Wilson led the
team last year with a .360 batting
average and a .608 slugging average.
He was also third in the U.S, Col-
lege Division in triples. Mitchell as
a pitched had the lowest ERA of

anyone on the team, and had a 5-3 |
| behind Virginia

record, the most victories for a W&I

pitcher in ten years. His bat did not |

suffer as a result, though, as evidenc-

led by his .310 batting average. Other

seniors returning are pitcher Lee
Halford and shortstop Gil Fitzhugh.
Pitchers Return

Other pitcher returning besides
Mitchell and Halford include Steve
Mahafee, returning after a year's

absence, freshmen Bill Greener, Jim
Noland, and Bill Miller, Last year’s
infield is all back and intact with
sophomore Ray Coates at first base.
junior John Nolan at second, Gil
Fitzhugh at short, and Steve Kalista,
junior transfer student, at third.
Back-ups include freshmen Bo
Brookby at third and John Robinson
at first. At catcher returns John
Baizley for his third season. In the
outfield is Thom Mitchell, who is
also our star centerfielder, Jim Wilson
in left, and Scott McChrystal in right.
Back-ups include Chris Coursen, who
plays either right or center, and
Dave Brooks, who can play the out-
field or second base.

a

With this group returning, results
this Spring look more promising than
in the past. WAL has strong hitting,
especially in Jim Wilson and Scott
McChrystal. Pitching is stronger than
in the past with three upperclassmen
returning and three freshmen to back-
The outfield and infield are back
in their entirety and this all points
toward a solid team.

The baseball team opens its season
March 21 on its home field against
Cleveland State.

 

 

Golf

The W&L golf team returns to
the links when official practice be-
gins on March 3, This does not mean,
however, that the golfers have been
idle since last May. On the con-
trary, they have been practicing indi-
vidually since the beginning of
school, weather permitting, and
Captain Gary Silverfield expects a
strong team this year having lost no
one to graduation last year,

The team is probably one of the
most experienced W&L has had in
years. Seniors Gary Silverfield, Bobby
Matthews, and Bill McLeod have all
played since their Freshman year,
Dick Singletary, an able addition, is
the only junior on the team, with
Jim Gordon and Ken Carter the re-
turning sophomores rounding out the
corps of returnees. Also senior Gil
lurner is coming out after a year’s
absence. There are several Freshman
hopefuls, including Bill Martin and
John Gunner.

Last year’s squad compounded a
7-1-1 record and placed second in
CAC Tournament. In the State
tournament the Generals placed fifth
lech, Virginia, Wil-
liam & Mary, and Old Dominion.
This year’s schedule looks to be much
the same as last year’s, and with no
losses the squad expects to do as
well or better this season. With the
able coaching of Mr. Twombly and
Buck Leslie, the assistant coach, we
see no reason to doubt their expecta-
tions,

The Generals will compete on the
links for the first time on April 9,
with Hampden-Sydney. Fans are
cordially invited to view the rout
at the Lexington Golf Course. They'd
