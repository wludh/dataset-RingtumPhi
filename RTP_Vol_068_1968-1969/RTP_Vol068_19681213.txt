Flu Strikes
Va. Schools;
Some Close

BULLETIN—Mary Baldwin Col-
lege officially suspended school
operations today.

Southern Seminary appears to have
been the latest area school to suc- |
cumb to the widespread flu epidemic
when the school was closed some time

this morning.

School officials were unavailable
for comment.

Elsewhere in area campuses the
situation varied. By Thursday three
schools had closed. Hollins and
Lynchburg Colleges were the first

ending their classes on Wednesday.
Randolph-Macon Woman's College at
12:30 Thursday afternoon.

However, most other schools to the
east and north of Lexington re-
ported that the flu situation was well
under control on their campuses.

Thursday afiernoon Sweet Briar |
reported only three or four cases in
the infirmary with symptoms similar
to those of the Hong Kong flu which
has taken its toll on other campuses.
Mary Baldwin reported “only seven
or eight girls in the infirmary with
what looks like regular flu.”

The nurse at the infirmary at
Southern Seminary seemed to think
yesterday that the situation was
under control there, however. She
reported “a few cases of bad colds
and flu, but no Hong Kong flu.”

Nurse Agnor at the W&L infirm-
ary reported that the situation was
not serious here. Yesterday she said,
“There are a few more than usual
in the infirmary, but they have mostly
colds, viruses, and so forth. We have
had no Hong Kong flu.”

This afternoon she said that still
no cases of Hong Kong flu had been
identified. She added, “We've got
beds for anybody that’s sick.”

Dr. Old, the Institute physician at
VMI, reported yesterday that there
was an “increased number of respt-
ratory infections” at VMI, but added
that this was “usual at this time of
year.” He stated, “We haven't had
anything that resembles Hong Kong
flu.”

The Dean of Students at Randolph-
Macon, explaining the reasons for
that school’s closing, said, “We were
having girls develop symptoms, and
the doctor decided that it would be
best to get the girls out, “The symp-
toms were not definitely certified as
Hong Kong flu by the Health De
partment in Richmond, but they seem

The honor system and a student representative on
ihe University’s Board of Trustees were among the
topics discussed by the Executive Committee in a
lengthy meeting Tuesday night.

Jay Passavant, president of the student body, an

serve as a representative of the students on the Uni
versity s Board of Trustees. His capacity will be as an

advisor from the student body, not as a full-time mem
ber. The Board of will determine the
responsibilities at its forthcoming meeting, January 18,

Hendricks noted that the honor system now

He further said that it contained legal trappings which
would not be tolerated in a court of law. On the other

Hendricks then proposed the following resolution:

“The following resolution is to be adopted by the
Executive Committee as regards procedural matters
in the conduct of administering the Honor System.
When a student is brought before the Executive Com-
mittee concerning a possible breach of the Honor
System on his part, he is to be told the following
pertaining to his own testimony:

“I. He does not have to testify before the Executive
Committee in the proceedings before them if he

“2. If he chooses to testify before the Executive

his decision to so testify pertains to both the hear-

subsequent public hearing which could potentially
result from a student's conviction before the Ex-
ecutive Committee and the implementation of his
right for a public hearing as a result of his conviction
by the Executive Committee.

Plans To Codify Honor System,
Establish Legal Student Rights
And Have Future ‘Bitch-Ins’

that if he does choose to testify before the Executive
Committee his testimony will be recorded and may
be used by the Executive Committee for purposes

Executive Committee in the event of a subsequent
public hearing and that the introduction of the record-
ing of the accused's testimony before the Executive
Committee can be made at any stage of a public
hearing deemed appropriate by the Executive Com-
mittee.”

The purpose of this statement is for interim action
until the final procedure can be established, but Hen-
dricks added that this will be consistent with what will
ultimately result

The vote for adoption of this resolution was 11-1
Junior EC member Steve Sandler voted against the
resoluiion because he felt that other matters pertaining
to procedure should also be specified He included such
specifics giving students time to work out
1 defense and further enumerations of trial procedure

It was strongly emphasized that the presence of
Huntley and McThenia advisory. They will
have no say in what goes into the Honor System since
it is completely run by the students

The second committee appointed by Passavant will
review the jurisdictional limits of the Honor System
It will study and evaluate existing policies with regard
to such matters as off-campus or out of university com-
munity offenses, offenses during vacations, pranks, or
in any case where applicability of the Honor System is
in question

The purpose of this committee is to establish a re
ferable framework so that decisions can be made with
repeated consistency. It is not to be interpreted as a
codification of the honor system, but as the establish-
ment of guidelines in unclear situations.

Serving on this committee will be secretary of the
student body Judson Simmons and newly-elected fresh

Honor System Revisions

The time has come for all of us to look into modifications |
and clarifications for the Washington and Lee Honor System.
This will have to be a job for all students, not just members
of the Executive Committee and the faculty. As pointed out
in Bill Walker’s article, W&L men have governed their lives |
by this system for a hundred years.

With this in mind, we are presenting for your considera-
tion at this time three suggestions which we feel should be
included in the Honor System. These suggestions will be taken
separately to the Executive Committee Monday night for that
body’s approval, with the ultimate aim of having them in-
cluded as amendments to the Student Body Constitution. With
the EC’s approval, over fifty per cent of all the members of
the student body must vote in favor of each of them in order
for them to be accepted.

According to the Student Body Constitution, the Honor
System is mentioned only twice. The first time the Honor
System is mentioned is in Article III (Duties of Officers),
Section C (Secretary), Paragraph 2: The Secretary of the
Student Body “shall keep accurate records of the proceedings
and evidence in Honor System cases and shall cause type-
written copies of the same to be recorded in the Honor System
Record Book.”

The second instance the Honor System is mentioned is
Section V (Duties and Powers of the Executive Committee) ,
Section B and C: The Executive Committee “shall have sole
jurisdiction in every Honor System case. Each case shall be
conducted in accordance with the Honor System Procedure
as stated. It shall see that the Honor System is carefully and
thoroughly explained to the entire Student Body at the be-
ginning of every session and shall provide access to all new
students and new faculty members a copy of both the Consti-
tution, including the explanation of the Honor System, and
the Procedure for Honor System cases.”

The point we wish to emphasize is that nowhere in the
Constitution are there any rights which are guaranteed to the
students. At the Bitch-In and at the public trial it was stated

 

that the Constitution guarantees the right of appeal for all stu-

Che Ring-tum Phi
ridau

dents. This is not true. The only rights which are delineated
are contained in the Honor System practices written by the
President of the Student Body. This may be found in the
Student Handbook. The President of the Student Body, Jay
Passavant, claimed that this does not change from year to
year. In fact, the statements on the Honor System written
by Richard Nash in 1967 and by Passavant this year cor-
respond word for word. However, since this statement is
supposedly written by the President, there is nothing which
says he cannot change it.

The amendments which will be proposed will not only
guarantee the rights of the students, but will also enumerate
rights set by the precedent in past honor cases. The pro-
posals are as follows:

1. All students possess the right of appeal at a Student
Body hearing after Executive Committee conviction. This
right of appeal is not now mentioned in the Constitution,
although it has been recognized by precedent,

2. A Student must be given notification 24 hours in
advance of the trial before the Executive Committee of the
charges against him and his rights in an honor proceed-
ing. Presently, the student does not know he has been
charged with a violation of the Honor System until mem-
bers of the EC “knock on his door.” In the meantime, the
EC has all the time it wants to prepare its case. In addition,
the student is under undue emotional stress and pressure
under these circumstances. This could very well lead to
misunderstanding or confusion on the student’s part which
would call into question the validity of his testimony as
evidence.

3. A Student must be permitted to construct his own

 

 

The Honor System Is A Failure ¢

By H. WILLIAM WALKER, JR.

series of articles on the Honor

study the system's faults and sug-
gest methods to improve it.

This first article was composed

degree, both meaningful and realistic.

larity between its article and this
one is purely coincidental.)

For one hundred years, Washing-
ton and Lee men have tried to govern
their individual and student lives by
what we know simply as the Honor
System. The excellence of the system
has seldom been challenged, and its
form has survived practically with-
out change. The system purports to
define both social and judicial stand-
ards of conduct, the former im-
plicitly, and the latter explicitly. After
four years of life under the Honor
System, I sincerely feel that it fails,
in both areas, to fulfill its purpose.

is our generation, in fact, seems to
be effecting the greatest change in
social as well as legal concepts. There
are not many Washington Lee men
in 1968 who even try to conform to
the social ideals which have long
been an integral part of our Honor
System as a whole. What would
General Lee have thought of men
who, in practice, condone drunkeness,
who find amusement in “dumping
on dates,” and who pride themselves
on their sexual promiscuity? I have
litthe doubt that he would have found
such practices damnable. Obviously,
if our daily social conduct may be
taken as a common denominator for
our beliefs and ideals, we do not.

 

Mock OAS Planned

By JORGE ESTRADA
At many universities one of the
events which draws the highest level
of student involvement every year is
a simulation of a political, national

or international, organization. This
is evidenced by mock UN Security
Councils, such as the one at Hollins

Mock Convention
recently held here at WAl
However, the before mentioned
events differ significantly in character
While our Mock Convention, held
every four years, is concerned only
with the national scene and limited
to the selection of a presidential
candidate, the mock UNSCs held at
various schools are annual events in
volving international problems of a
wider scope. We think it is time for
Washington and Lee students to be
come involved in this wider scope
We hereby propose to undertake the

College, and the

establishment of a Mock Organiza-
tion of American States to be held
this spring.

The OAS is a regional organization,
whose members are nations of the
Western Hemisphere exclusive of
Cuba and Canada, that has priority
over the United Nations as far as
solving inter-American problems. The
Cuban and the Dominican Republic
crises are examples of cases handled
by the OAS

\ Mock OAS would entail the
representation of 24 universities. Each
delegation would represent a country
member of the OAS and would be
fully prepared to act legitimate
spokesman for that country. A key-
note speaker, possibly the actual
Secretary-General of the OAS, will
open a two-day session, The repre-
sentatives will then proceed to present

case before the Executive Committee at trial proceedings.
This should include confronting his accusers and calling
his own witnesses. As the situation now stands, the Executive
Committee is called upon to function as prosecution, de-
fense, judge and jury. It is questionable whether any man
can function adequately in the simultaneous performance
of all these roles. It would seem that something would neces-
sarily be slighted—possibly the defense. This seems out of
joint in a system which supposedly works upon the credo that
a man is innocent until proven guilty.

These are the proposed amendments. We feel they are
needed to guarantee due process in honor cases. We know
that other students here are also concerned about this, as
evidenced in a recent Forensic Union debate which ended up
by rejecting the present system because it deprives one of due
process. In the Forensic Union debate, the question of the
ultimate penalty also came into question.

We do not intend to beg you to care about your Honor
System. But if it does mean something to you and you wish
it to remain a strong and workable force on campus, then
we feel you are obligated to see that its weaknesses are ironed
out. This entails either suggesting other proposals or sup-
porting as strongly as possible the ones which we have just
suggested.

This is your Honor System. It can be strengthened only
by your support and interest. This is too important an issue
to be ignored.

Thanks To Committee

The Tuesday editorial thanked the faculty for approving
a five-day week. We also would like to thank the faculty, but
in particular the faculty committee which labored so hard to
come up with an acceptable plan.

The members of this committee, Messrs. E. B. Hamer,
O. S. McGuire, R. W. Royston and J. D. Cook, are to be
commended. At times their operations were slowed down be-
cause of confusion resulting from certain complex points.
But in the end they came through. As far as we are con-
cerned, that’s all that really counts. |

Swimmers Lose To American

The General's swimming team

noon they lost to a strong American
University, 60-44, but gained more
than adequate revenge by defeating
an inexperienced squad from Roanoke
College, 69-23.

American University invaded Dore-
mus natatorium with perhaps the
strongest team to swim there.

The Generals were able to capture
only three individual firsts, and they
won the final relay after the meet
had been clinched by American. The
outstanding General performance was
Bill Brumback’s first in the 50 yard
freestyle with a time of 20.7 seconds,

 

which broke his own pool record set
last year.
Other General

Generals have not been able to beat
Catholic in the last four years and
suffered a 55-49 defeat in last year’s
meet in Washington. Coach Stearns
said that he is anticipating some ex-

meet.

Besides the records in the relay

American team also captured a record

Washington and Lee's cagers,
bouncing back after their season-
opening loss to Randolph-Macon,
stretched their winning streak to four
straight by beating Hampden-Sydney
College last night in Doremus Gym-
nasium, 75-73.

Last Friday the Generals traveled

to Richmond to play Virginia Com-

 

Wrestlers Bow
To Towson State

Towson State brought a talented
group of wrestlers to Doremus Gym-
nasium last Friday night to spoil the

debut of the Washington and Lee
grapplers, 29-11. The score might
have been worse except for a fine

showing by the home team’s heavier
men.

Towson jumped off to a 29-0 lead
with victories in every weight class
from 123 to 167. Freshman Buzzy
White was pinned in the third period
by Bruce McCurrin for the visitors.
Co-captain Razz Rasberry lost a de-
cision to Dale Hutchinson and Wes
Pullman was pinned by Dan Griffin
for Towson in the second period.
Bruce Hankins, wrestling at 145 for
the Generals, couldn’t catch the early
lead built by his opponent, Bob New-
ton, and lost a _ decision while
Brent Hankins lost on a fall in the
i first period to Ray Grosykowski.

Dave Higgins lost on points 8-1 to
Harold White of the visitors and
Clarke Carter became the seventh
| straight General victim, suffering a
| second period pin to Bob Hansen of
| Towson. However, the weight classes
|from 177 to heavyweight belong to
the Generals’ trio of Dan Webster,
freshman Jim Hooker, and co-captain
| Jay Clarke.

Webster began the process of sal-
| vaging the Generals’ pride by de-
| stroying his man, Darrell Freels.
| Aggressive and in command all the

 

 

| way, Webster picked up five points
by winning by default, as an in-
jury forced Freels to the sidelines

Jim Hooker picked up where Webster
left off. completely dominating Tow-
son's Bill Harper for a 9-0 decision,
hiking the total for the home team to
eight.

Senior Jay Clarke completed the
comeback with a brilliant 3-0 win in
a David and Goliath match. Clarke's
opponent, Dave Nicoli, had a defi-
nite edge in size over the WAI
captain, but the quickness and the
know-how of Clarke brought home
| the victory and made the final score
| 29-11.
| Coach Miller had special praise for
| Webster and Clarke. He said that
the win by Clarke was the “smart-
} est match” the Richmond captain had
ever wrestled. The aggressiveness of
| Webster was pleasing, both to Coach
| Miller and the unusually large crowd

monwealth University. Although the |
Rams took 100 shots from the|
floor, the Generals led the entire |
game in winning 83-70. What won |
for the Generals was their superiority |
at the foul line. This was the weak-
est part of last year’s team and it
appears that no longer will the Gen-
erals be held up to ridicule for inept
foul shooting. Forty-seven times the
Generals paraded to the free throw
line and 33 times the ball went
through the hoop. Although VCU
managed six more field goals than
W&L, the Generals’ newly-found
ability to convert free throws brought
them victory.

Stuart Fauber finished with
points, including 12 of 13 from the
charity stripe. Mike Neer followed
him with 20 points and Mel Cart-
wright and Norwood Morrison added
18 and 10 points, respectively. Cart-
wright also grabbed 16 rebounds to
take the game honors.

Lynchburg
Tuesday night Washington and
Lee’s basketball team played per-

haps the best half this writer has
seen in four years at Doremus.
Opening with a full court press, the
Generals blew Lynchburg College’s
Hornets almost out of the gymnasium
in racing to a 61-27 halftime lead.
The Generals cooled off in the sec-
ond half and the second string saw
considerable action. The final score
ended up 96-60, as Mel Cartwright
led all scorers with 24 points. Cart-
wright was taken out after his 24th
point and presented with the game
ball. His 24th point was also the
1000th point of his three-year career
at W&L. Fauber, Neer and Daniels
scored 16, 14 and 14 respectively, to
put four players in double figures for
the fourth time.

Hampden-Sydney

Hampden-Sydney’s Tigers came to
WAL last night never having lost to
a Coach Verne Canfield team. How-
ever, their jinx was broken, as the
Generals edged the Tigers 75-73. The
Tigers Fred McNeer opened the game
as if he were going to score 100
points. Hitting four straight for the
Tigers, McNeer paced the Tigers to
a commanding lead, which was held
until nine seconds were left in the
first half. The Generals had whittled
away at the lead until Neer’s jumper

to attend meetings.

The points emphasized by Sandler and Turnbull
were to sponsor other “Bitch-In’s” which have specific
topics; dispel the feeling of secrecy which students
attribute to the EC; encourage ideas directly from the
students (Turnbull said, “Minutes are being distributed
now and students know what's going on, but they
still don’t bring ideas.”); publicize more fully that the
EC is open to the public; and have EC members
write articles in the newspaper expressing their own
ideas and those of the EC,

Passavant asked Sandler and Simmons to lay down
as many specific solutions as possible and report back
at a later meeting.

Student Civil Liberties Committee

Jack Horowitz, chairman of the Student Civil Lib-
erties Committee, asked the EC for permission to have
Pleas Geyer assist him in the operations of his commit-
tee. Other members of the committee will be chosen at
the EC’s next meeting Monday night. All those interest-
ed in joining the committee must submit letters of
intent to Judson Simmons no later than 6 p.m, Sunday.
Interviews will be held Monday night beginning at
7:15, Six to eight members will be selected. This num-
ber includes the EC represenetative Turnbull.

Passavant stated that the duties of the SCLC would
be to determine what rights the students have when
they come in contact with standing committees in any
situations that would lead to the EC, Cold Check Com-
mittee, Publications Board and Student Control Com-
mittee. Various questions to be posed will include the
authority of various deans and the rights of appeal or
dissent of the students. The eventual goal of this com-
mittee is to arrive at a “Bill of Rights” for students
to be amended to the student body constitution and

Studies Honor System

to be approved by the faculty in an effort to insure
the rights of the individual.
Further Student Representation
Passavant announced that the president of the stu-
dent body or some other representative of the EC will
be given time at the beginning of each faculty meeting
to deliver a report of issues being dealt with by that

body and any action being pursued by the EC. Com- |
ments and suggestions will be accepted in an effort to)

improve effective communications between students and
faculty.

In addition, he added that a proposal to have an
EC representative on the faculty executive committee
is pending.

Mock OAS Session

Jorge Estrada, senior student from Medellin, Co-
lombia, asked for money from the EC to finance a
mock Organization of American States session at Wash-
ington and Lee next spring. He asked for $500 for this
project. It was decided that the EC could not now
affoird to finance it entirely. However, Leonard will
meet with Estrada this week to determine means for
financing.

Leonard reported that the student tax of $650 plus
the interest on the Student Body Reserve Fund (interest
is collected from bond investments and two real estate
loans and amounts to about $500 yearly) make up the
working fund for the whole year. He emphasized that
any money taken from the reserve fund, which cur-
rently approximates $98000, would lower the interest
received on it.

In the final business of the evening, Ron Kessler,
interim Mock Convention chairman, reported that many
bills owed May’s Mock Convention have not been paid.
The EC will check with those people who still owe
money

resolutions concerning — problems,
either factual or hypothetical which
face the American nations; these prob-
| lems will be of a political, militaristic,
} or economic nature.

The participating schools will be
selected from applications sent from
approximately 60 eastern colleges.
There will be nearly 70 delegates, in-
cluding faculty members who will
act as political advisors, to house and
feed. The sessions will be held in
Doremus Gymnasium. Expenses will
include cost of mailing and paper
work, room and board, and a closing
social event.

To accomplish this, we need strong
student body support. The initiators
of this idea, Jorge Estrada and
Thomas Blanton, and the original sup-
porters, the Friday Ring-tum Phi and
the Political Science and International
Relations Club, have received an en-
thusiastic response from both faculty
and students. Miss Judy Tompkins
(organizer and Secretary General of
the Randolph-Macon Mock Security
Council), John Motsinger (president
of the PSIRC), and Jorge Estrada ap-
pealed to the EC for financial aid.
Even though strong support was given
to the idea, the EC did not feel it
was prepared to act immediately.
However, Student Body Vice-Presi-
dent Danny Leonard, was commis-
sioned ot meet with Estrada to discuss
the matter further. There will be
a report on a meeting with Dean
Atwood and President Huntley
soon as possible.

The Beatles? Satire?

(Continued from Page 2)

Che Beatles have humility, they don’t
trust opinions, All they wanted to
do was record a lot of songs about
music.

What's more, most of the songs
are funny. If not funny, then they're
affectionate, sharp, or ironic—some-
times all four, as in “Honey Pie.” It’s
had to put that in an article in Time.

For example, take “Back in the
USSR,” the first cut, which appears
to parody the Beach Boys. But only
the middle section sounds like them.
Either the parody’s a failure or the
song’s attempting something else. Al-
though Newsweek says exactly six-
teen of the songs are parodies, very
few stand this kind of examination.

Look at the songs as essays in
musical form. Take “Piggies.” We all
know that reformers often become
intolerant and bitter—for example,
the Puritans, or the Maoists of “Rev-
olution.” Mightn’t a reformist song
become petulant and quarrelsome?
So “Piggies” declines from a kind of
arch-irony to a petty desire that
“they” all get spanked.

Again, “soul music” can be virile
love or brute sensuality. If brute, it
might lack subtlety. The album con-
tains a couple of astonishing examples.

The Beatles turn this critical ap-
proach on themselves. Ringo’s song,
the ponderously warm “Don't Pass
Me By,” contains (intentionally) the
worst country music arrangement
ever recorded—an organ, fiddle, and
drums: the night we all fell asleep
at the barn dance. “Glass Onion,”
as everyone knows, announces that
Paul is the walrus. Believe it or not.

A characteristic of music is to
captivate the feelings. This is always
dangerous to some extent. The Beatles
are right hard on viviousness; but they
keep perspective. They have a nag-
ging fondness for songs with nice
feelings, even the utterly sentimental
“Good Night.”

All the styles of songs in this album
are familiar to us; our age group
especially has gone through school
with them. The Beatles draw out
their implications and make us ac-
cept our responsibility for the part
of us that they are.
