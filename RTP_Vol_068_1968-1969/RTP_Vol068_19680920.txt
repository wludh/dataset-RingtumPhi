Pres. Huntley
Sees Progress
For University

President Robert E. R. Huntley's
address to the student body Wednes-
day afternoon in Doremus Gymna-
sium reviewed the events that had
affected the University over the sum-
mer and stressed facts pertinent to

what he termed “the state of the
University.”
President Huntley remarked on

recent additions to the faculty and
mourned the deaths of several mem-
bers of the campus community. Fle
added that the faculty continues to
be “the major substance of optimism
about the future.”

Plans are being developed to meet
the physical as well as the human
needs of the school, he reported, list-
ing a new fieldhouse, upperclass
dorms and improvements to the
library and theater as examples.

Rush Week 1968, probably the last
first semester rush W&L will see,
concluded Wednesday night with as
much zeal and probably more mis-
haps than in years before.

Clark Carter, President of the In-
terfraternity Council, reported that
approximately 330 of the 340 fresh-
men (about 97%) participated in rush.
As of late Thursday 98 freshmen had
unofficially pledged a __ fraternity.

“little bit higher” than last year,
mainly because more violations were

A Summer Of Loss

Everyone who joins the Washington and Lee University
community realizes that every member is an integral part of
it. The loss of one member will deeply affect all the others.
This was the case this summer as seven people close to Wash-
ington and Lee passed away.

Charles Rice McDowell Sr. died July 6 at the age of 72.
He had been a member of the law school faculty for 41 years.
The summer edition of the Washington and Lee Alumni

Magazine says, “Prof. McDowell and his family have been

so closely associated with the university that it is hard to
separate one from the other.”
Although Prof. McDowell was a humorous author, his

great devotion was to law teaching. He was honored with |

numerous honorary degrees and fraternal memberships for
his outstanding contributions to the legal profession.
The effect which he had over the years upon his classes

is described by a former student: ‘In the many years since |

I left Washington and Lee I have never met a Washington
and Lee law school graduate who did not speak fondly and
admiringly of him. He dedicated his life to teaching all of us

not only the law but the high and fine principles for which |

he always stood. Few men can qualify as a true friend, a good
leader, a learned professor, and a man’s man. He did.’ ”’

Lee Massey McLaughlin, varsity football coach and newly
appointed head of the Department of Physical Education, was
electrocuted on August 13 at his summer camp.

The Richmond Times-Dispatch said, “No Virginian of
his generation, it seems safe to say, did more to build ideals
of high character and true sportsmanship than Lee Mc-
Laughlin.” He was interested primarily in keeping sports on

a high level, rather than in the prevalent mania for winning
at all costs.

But this did not keep Coach “Mac” from winning. After
two years of almost complete disaster when he first came to
W&L as a coach, his teams went through the 1960-61-62 sea-
sons with 25 wins, 1 loss and 1 tie. Last season he coached
W&L to the state small college championship.

Not being able to award scholarships to lure athletes
did not disturb him. He was quoted as saying, “ ‘I think foot-
ball has a place at Washington and Lee, but subsidization not.

here

We're playing sports here as they were originally meant to
be played—for fun and enjoyment.’ With this philosophy
he greatly enriched the lives of those who had the opportunity
to be associated with him.

Andrew David Beckner, a rising sophomore from Martins-
ville, Va., was killed August 10 in an automobile accident in |
Stoneville, N.C.

Beckner had been a member of Lambda Chi Alpha fra-
ternity and a member of the freshman basketball team. In a
basketball game last season against Staunton Military Academy,
he led the team to victory with a last-minute field goal.

Joseph Desha Didier, an 18-year-old freshman from Mau- |
mee, Ohio, died of an apparent heart attack Wednesday after-
noon. During his short residence at Washington and Lee, he
won the respect of many of his fellow classmates. In addition,
he had been offered pledging bids to several fraternities.

Douglas Gaylor (Gay) Crockett died July 10 at the age

of 47. He had been maintenance foreman for the Washing- |

ton and Lee buildings and grounds department for seven years. | |

Mrs. Elizabeth Drury Dickey, the wife of Dr. Robert W.
Dickey, who retired in 1961 as the head of the physics de-
partment here after more than 50 years as a member of the
faculty, passed away on July 18. She had been the chairman
of the visual correction division of Lexington Children’s Clinic
and the organist at Robert E. Lee Memorial Episcopal Church.

Mrs. Rupert N. Latture passed away on August 28. She

was the wife of the retired chairman of the Washington and |

Lee political science department.

Although these people are no longer with us, their achieve-
ments have served to enrich the Washington and Lee Uni-
versity community and all of us who are part of it.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Experienced Generals Face Untested Guilford Team

With 33 lettermen on his squad,
Washington and Lee University head
football coach Buck Leslie should be
pretty optimistic about the coming
campaign.

But he’s been to coaching clinics,
and he knows he’s supposed to poor-
mouth at least a little bit, especially
in public.

“Personnel-wise, we are fairly well
set from last year,” Leslie admits.
“But that doesn’t mean we don't
have some trouble spots.”

One, believe it or not, is a lack
of depth at several key positions,
especially in the offensive line. And
while there’s plenty of experience in
the offensive backfield, the Generals
could stand a littke more beef there,
particularly at fullback.

Leslie has not scheduled any scrim-
mages—"“We're thin, and we can’t
afford to beat each other up.” But
last Monday, after a week of light
workouts and basic fundamentals, the
Generals began some real-nitty-gritty
contact work.

The coaches were obviously pleas-
ed, both with the offense and the
defense.

The Generals’ excellent defensive
unit of last year (four of them made
All-State) returns almost completely
intact, led by co-captains John Wolf
and Scott Mackenzie. Wolf, a tiger
despite limited size, is one of the

best linebackers W&L has ever pro-|'

duced.

Returning with Wolf as linebackers
are veterans Jay Meriwether and the
Kumpuris brothers, junior Dean and
sophomore Drew. The Generals’
front line is long on experience as
well with a quintet of seniors—Mac-
kenzie, Britt McJunkin, John Harris,
Ken Long and Hank Wilson. They
average 204 pounds.

The defensive backfield is led by
last year’s sensational safety, Charley
Freret, who intercepted 10 enemy
passes. Senior letterman Don Sharpe
returns at halfback, and three youngst-
ers—juniors John Nolan and Jay
Dorman and soph Lee Graham—
add a lot of ability to the secondary.

Things are looking up for the
offense, especially at quarterback.
Senior Alan Tomlin has first crack
at the starting job, based on his fine
performance in spring drills, and ac-
cording to Coach Leslie, “he is handl-
ing it very well.”

Junior Chuck Kuhn and Jack Baiz-
ley are “in a dead heat” close be-

hind Tomlin, and both have been
running the General offense well in
practice.

At left half, muscular Luke Cros-
land and junior Joe Dozier have been
putting up a real battle for the job.
“Both will play a lot,” notes Leslie.

Right halfback has been a trouble
spot in the past, but no more with
senior Bucky Cunningham there. Last
year, in his first varsity season Cun-
ningham grabbed 44 passes for 468
yards and two touchdowns, “He looks
as good as ever,” said Leslie, “and
Sam Hinkle (a track man) looks

better than he’s ever looked.”

Fullback has its weaknesses. Senior
Dick Kinney has plenty of experi-
ence, but he’s light. Sophomore Doug
Gossman is a good prospect but
lacks experience.

In the tackle positions, the Gen-
erals have two fairly experienced
performers in Tom McJunkin and
soph Steve Hannon, with good back-
up men in Thornton and Tom Mul-
lenix.

At end, Leslie plans to go with his
experienced duo, John Thomas and
Rick McMillan. Sophomore Frank
Stearns and junior Steve Mahaffey
may play a lot.

 

 

They are (left to right) Alan Tomlin, Chuck Kuhn, and Jack Baizley.

 

Lettermen Reinhard Fischer and
Stamen Ogilvie return at guard, but
the latter is only a sophomore. Andy
Smith, has looked good, and Dee
Copenhaver is coming on strong.

So the Generals have a lot of ex-
perience, with six All-Staters in Mac-
kenzie, Wolf, Sharpe, Freret, Cun-
ningham and Clarke. But they prob-
ably will need every bit of it in the
Opening game Sept. 21 against Guil-
ford.

The Quakers, somewhat of an un-

known quantity due to graduation
losses and a completely new coach-
ing staff, zilched W&L 35-0 in last
year’s Opening game.

Field Saturday.

'68 Soccer Team Has Look Of Winner

By ROY CARLTON

Season after season Washington
and Lee's soccer team keeps on win-
ning and this season should be no
exception. Indeed, if coach Joe Lyles’
team stays healthy, they have a fine
chance of bettering last year’s 9-3
record.

Back from last year’s team is sure-
fire All-America candidate Scott
Fechnay. In his previous three cam-
paigns, Fechnay completely demor-
alized opponents with his brilliant
ball control and scoring ability. (Last
year, Scott scored all five goals as
WAL topped VMI 5-4.)

But Fechnay is not the only cause
for optimism. His fellow co-captain,
Thom Mitchell, is a goalie “par ex-
cellence.” Mitchell was unbeatable
last year, and proved to be the win-
ning difference in numerous games.
His speed and agility won him an
All-State selection, and this year

‘shouldn't be any different.

Also back is Jack Horowitz, an
outstanding senior lineman who team-
ed up with Fechnay on numerous
scoring plays. Horowitz is a speedy
little guy who plays excellent de-
fense. If he keeps up his fine per-
formances, Horowitz may very well
join his teammates, Fechnay and
Mitchell, as an All-Stater this year

Since only three seniors graduated
from last years team, there should
be little problem in fielding an ex-
perienced squad. Other key players
beck from last year's team include
junior John Yow and Brian Price, and
last fall's freshman starter Carl Hiait.

All not roses however. The
squad is extremely thin. The
freshman team was hardly a power-
house, and so, eXperienced and cap-

is

Assistant Coach E. Graham (Buck)
Leslie was named acting head foot-
ball coach at Washington and Lee
University on August 22.

In making the announcement, Uni-
versity President Robert E. R. Huntley
also said that retiring athletic director
E. P. (Cy) Twombly would continue
in that position for the time being.

The announcements followed the
sudden death on August 13 of head
football coach Lee M. McLaughlin,
whose appointment as athletic director
to succeed Twombly was to have
become effective Sept. 1.

“We are fortunate that we have
on our staff such experienced leaders
who can take over Lee McLaughlin's
duties at this time of tragedy and
carry on the athletic program in his
spirit,” President Huntley said.

The 43-year-old Leslie has been
assistant football coach in charge of
the backfield since he joined the WAI
faculty in 1960. Twombly, 71, has
been on the University athletic staff

director since 1954

| The major concern of all the
