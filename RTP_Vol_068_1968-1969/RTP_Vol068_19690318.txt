‘The way

I see it’

(Editor’s note: “The way I see it”
is a column of general editorial
comment for which contributions
are solicited from students and
faculty concerning any topic.)

By JOHN K. MOTSINGER
Mr. James Loesel, instructor in
Political Science, remarking on the
model OAS said something to this
effect. “This thing is really impressive.
It looks a whole lot better than it

really is.” He make a good point.
What was good, what was bad

 

about the conference? I don’t think
all of the answers are available to-
day. After a few weeks the glamour
will have worn off and delegates can
criticize this performance objectively.

 

Perhaps the most impressive part
of the conference is that it even oc-
curred. Washington and Lee has been
called an apathetic campus, yet the |
sessions were filled with delegates and
and observers who made the ses-
sions lively and interesting, but not
exactly “in character” with an Inter-
American Conference,

But, taken in the context of the
problems inherent in organizing such
a conference, I would have to rate
it a success. Model OAS’s are not
as common as Model Security Coun-
cils. Delegation chairmen had no
way of finding out actual policy from
most countries due to the poor pub-
lic relations of the embassies them-
selves.

As several delegates told me, the
embassies sent out maps, tourist in-
formation and promotional handbooks
for business men. This type of re-
action does not help the serious
student.

I do not mean to absolve myself

and the steering committee from fe-

oa. 04 ‘ . i re . the
sponsibility. We did not perform | ge le lt
perfectly. Our mistakes included | °"""* — =“

logistics and lack of communications,
and most of all, lack of adequate
knowledge of the problems that we
would encounter until they were al-
ready upon us.

Mistakes made this year can be
avoided in any future ventures of this
sort. 1 have asked several of the

delegates from other schools for criti-
cal evaluations, and would appreciate
the same from Washington and Lec |
participants and observers.

To stop now would be ill-advised. |
1 am optimistic enough to call for |
a group of interested students and
faculty to start making plans today
for a similar, but much more polish-
ed. conference to be held in the
spring of 1970, As we have built up
expertise in Mock Conventions, now
is our chance to perform a similar
feat (if not on such a grand scale)
in international relations.

Ihe Executive Committee in a
lengthy meeting Monday night voted
to accept five proposed amendments
to the student body constitution, Also
it gave its unanimous support to a
measure introduced by Jay Passavant
which called for the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee to extend Spring vaca-
tion an extra day, Phil Thompson,
representative from the Law School,
was absent.

een

Passavant’s proposal to add an
extra day to Spring vacation was
prompted by the fact that the present
schedule calls for the holiday to end
on Easter Sunday, April 6. Because
of the inconvenience of traveling on
Easter, he suggested that Monday
classes be dropped and that school
begin Tuesday, April 8. The extra
day could then be made up sometime
later in the year.

The disintegration of the party
system in W&L campus politics

First of two parts

By ROY CARLTON

Editorial-Page Editor

WAL and soon the campus will be
littered with the usual campaign post-
ers. They'll all say the same thing,
and you'll wonder how many times
you've heard it before. Some students

LETTERS TQ THE COITOR

PSA’s purposes outlined

Recently some concerned students
formed an organization called the
Progressive Students’ Alliance. I wish
to define this group's purpose because
for some reason we have received
great criticism and mocking. The
group is a forum for discussion of
change and liberalism. Liberalism
implies that all ideas and suggestions
are welcome and will receive equal
consideration in meetings. Our meet-
ings are run very openly, with no
leader or single speaker, We have de-
cided not to have organization, as
elected officers, so that no one man’s
ideas are more influential than others.

Representatives of the PSA have
met with President Huntley three
times to date. Our meetings involved
discussion of all ideas brought up at
PSA meetings. Mr. Huntley's response
has been most encouraging. He has
consented to giving our organization
official representation in the Student
Handbook and we will send a speaker
to freshman camp.

It would take a much longer
article to state all ideas brought up
so far but briefly, some important
things are: (1). We sponsored a peti-
tion for the short term though student
interest was low. (2). We are form-
ing plans to sponsor a group of
speakers later in the spring. The
topics will include the black man in
America, the student movement on
college campuses in the U.S, and
the draft. G). We are investigating
the pay situation of WAL non-aca-
demic workers. (4). We are working
hand-in-hand with the administration
in setting up a free Co-ed University
on Saturdays with Hollins, (5). In
a drive to get Student Evaluation
Power of the Faculty we will work
to establish a student publication that
includes individuals’ evaluations of
teachers and their courses, (6). Dorm
regulations, (7). Drawing more black
applicants, (8). Community responsi-
bility of the WAL student.

All these areas which are witness-
ing change and review within the
faculty now. We need student partici-
pation to gain realization of these
improvements. The PSA is for all
students interested in bettering WAL.
We meet in the seminar room under
the library on Monday nights, Lets
see some student activism. We can
turn all this talk into action with

may even get frustrated enough to
organize a boycott. Some may put
up their own independent candidates
to upset the “cliques.” Only one thing
is certain, all but the individual
candidates’ fraternity brothers will be
calling for a change in what they
nebulously refer to as “the system.”

Certainly it would seem that there
is a great deal of collusion between
certain houses. In the past couple of
years the Phi Kaps have all but
dominated the EC. Beta has also
been a permanent fixture and oc-
casionally SAE, ZBT, and SPE have
made shows of force. One wonders
why it is that a new electoral system
has not been devised if the same
houses perennially lock up the com-
mittee posts,

The answer to the problem is not
very satisfying. It's somewhat dis-
turbing to realize that the present
system has only been around some
four years. Before that time, however,
student politics wallowed in a mire
of organized cliques.

Post-war W&L found the Univer-
sity’s eighteen fraternities divided into
two political parties. The party system

was a simple, painless, and efficient balance.

 

method of choosing class officers.
Each house belonged to a_ political
party, and each house voted uniformly
for it’s party’s candidates. Freshmen
were absorbed into the system from
their first weeks of pledging.

The two post-war parties were the
University and Independent parties.
Despite the name of the latter, there
was no semblance of independence in
either party. They were “cliques” and
they used that word to describe them-
selves. By far the more powerful
was the University party. Although
there were switches in party align-
ment from time to time, the com-
ponent fraternities of the University
party were Beta Theta Pi, Delta
Upsilon, Kappa Alpha, Phi Delta
Theta, Phi Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa
Alpha, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma
Nu, and Zeta Beta Tau, They held a
numerical edge of one over the Inde-
pendent party which consisted of
Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma,
Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Epsilon Pi,
Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Psi,
Pi Kappa Phi, and Sigma Chi.

Such a party breakdown turned out
to be fairly sound due to the 9-8

Camelot
faulty acting and

By KIRK WOODWARD

Camelot is more than a bad film;
it is the classic bad film of the past
ten years or so. It is a donkey on
which every clever critic pins his
favorite insults, (That was one.) But
in its own ponderous, unsubtle way,
it is also a trap. To see the trap,
imagine a critic panning the film:

“Even on Broadway, Camelot never
looked comfortable. Arthur fell out
of a tree in the first scene and in-
vented civilization and the Round
Table in the second scene. The
film has not digested its materials any
better than the musical did. Its tone
shifts from scene to scene, from
musical comedy to pathos: in fact it
never recovers from that fall out of
the tree.

“All the ads say the film is visually
stunning. A quick glance shows why;
ne one involved in its design uses
any taste. The castle at Camelot, for
example. looks like a Navy destroyer
Many other “outdoor” shots look like
what they are, namely studio sets
Frames are composed by placing as
much colorful clutter within camera
range as will fit.

“Richard Harris's acting sets a sort
ef technical standard: he uses two
acting techniques, the shout and the
whisper. Normally he alternates the
two from line to line, but just be
fore intermission he combines them
in one sentence: “umma KING He
delivers his songs using the same
two crutches and the guiless arrange-
ments of Alfred Newman.”

 

panned as total disaster,

screenplay hurt

Eic., ete. Fun’s fun, but mean-
while there’s something to be learned
from the failure of this film, Look
at the issues raised in Camelot: Arthur
dreams of a truly civilized world;
Guenivere and Lancelot cannot recon-
cile their roles in Aruthr’s dream
with their love for each other. How
can a film begin to portray a dream
like Arthur's or a dilemma like Lance-
lot's and Guenivere's?

One way is to try to understand
the characters, the way Alan Arkin
understands Mr. Singer in “The Heart
is a Lonely Hunter.” This approach
requires creative work, in fact an
intellectual effort. Another approach
is to create an emotional effect so
strong that nobody feels he needs to
use his intelligence. Camelot tries that
one. It represents Arthur's dream with
vague talk about Justice and with
shots of ruthless villains destroying
pastel greeting-card prettiness. It
represents the lovers’ dilemma by
showing lots of furrowed brows and
by going all weepy in moments of
tension.

Everybody recognizes that Camelot
fuils, whatever it tries to do, Still,
the emotional movie-beast triumphs
more often than not, Some of the
species, like In the Heat of the Night,
encourage depravity in audiences;
Camelot is too dull to do that, so
it simply degrades and humiliates its
characters. Tt is only vacuous, but
the sticcessful examples are vicious.
One cannot be too careful about
wentifying them

(Now, whats the trap?)

however, the University party usually
controlled the elections. Between
1958-60, though, the first cracks in
the system began to appear. In a
controversial and crucial move, the
Sigma Chi’s switched their allegiance
to the University party in 1958, This
gave the party a big advantage and
elections ceased to be decided at the
polls. Each year the party nominating
convention would divide up the offices
among the houses. In what was be-
ginning to amount to a one party
system, the nominating convention
became in effect, an appointive com-
mittee.

The key to any potential Independ-
ent party successes lay in the non-
fraternity men. There were a large

smaiee of them, but they were for
the most part unorganized. In 1960,
however, the catalyst was devised
which spelled the end of the party
system. An eighteenth fraternity,
Sigma Phi Epsilon, was formed which
united some of these non-Greeks for
the first time. More importantly, the
SPE’s were unaffiliated and could
change the electoral setup to a more
competitive level.

Hungry for power and recognition,
the SPE’s turned to the University
party in 1962. The result was a top-
heavy system that couldn't possibly
work. Finally, in the spring of 1963,
the whole issue exploded. The Uni-
versity party divided into two fac-
tions, each absorbing some of the
old Independent houses. The split also
marked the division of Red Square
against itself for the first time.

The two new conglomerates now
had nine houses each. The seceding
group, Progressives, were made up
of Delta Tau Delta, Kappa Sigma,
Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Kappa Psi,
Pi Kappa Alpha. Sigma Alpha
Fpsilon and Zeta Beta Tau. The re-
mains of the University party bonded
together Beta Theta Pi, Delia Upsilon,

Barbs and Bristles ...

Our unco-operative

By Jeffrey Wexler
Columnist

CLARIFICATION — Numerous
personages great and small have sur-
prised me by commenting favorably
on my fulminations here. They have
in the main, however, remarked that
while the language was enjoyed the
sense was incomprehensible. I agree.
SOCLAL NOTES FROM THE
OTHER OTHER SIDE... o@,
“Who got my gold inlaid bathtub?”
There are no sidewalks in Providence
Hill. Drainage systems are rudiment-
ary. In this Lexington neighborhood
some of the streets are more gravel
than macadam tar. Yet this writer
found the people there to a great
degree both happy and civilized. How
baffling.

STUDENT POWER — It is al-
ways pleasant to know the extent of
our guillibility. The magnitude is great
when it comes to that red brickwork
building with the word “buffoon”
written on one corner. When my
father was here some quarter of a
century ago, that building was the
“Mess”—later, “The Dope Shop.”
This is still true for both apellations,
The building houses the “Co-op"—a
true misnomer; “Mess” or “Dope
Shop” would be far more fitting.

There's nothing cooperative about
that lamentable institution. The hold-
ers of that franchise are in the cat-
bird's seat and they know it. Examine
the University Supply Store for your-
self. Examine its malpractices one
by one.

There is a certain knowledge known
only to God and The Ring-tum Phi
(which is probably the first time in
history that the Deity has been so
paired). Only He and they know the
number of surveys, polls, and refe-
rendums in which we have been
privileged to participate these recent
days. For all the general concern with
the intangibles of Honor and Cur-
riculum, when was the last time any-
one asked you what you'd like to see
in the fahem) “Co-op?”

Would you like to see magazines
sold there? Would you like to see
records and tapes sold there? Would
you like to see students working be-
hind the counter——as they do in Mrs.
Munger's bookstore (located in the
heart of the Uncooperative, but not
truly part of it)? Would you like to
see second-hand texts sold there as
well as new ones?

Are the textbook and stationery
prices low enough? Enough. The Un-
cooperative is but a monopoly farmed
out to Lexington businessmen. Busi-
nessmen whens sole motivation ee

exploits us all.

One might suggest that “Co-op” be
run for and by the inhabitants of this
University rather than by franchise
to a non-W&L party. This minority
of one did so suggest as a “candidate”
(tongue-in-cheek, foot-in-mouth) in
the Student Body Presidency race last
April.

Ruggers

“A game for hooligans, played by
gentlemen” is the definition of rugby,
a rough-but-merry cross between
American football and soccer. Wash-
ington and Lee’s Rugby Football Club
is presently engaged in spring
campaign, bringing a Europeon flavor
to the realm of W&L athletics

Ihe sport itself founded at
Rugby School, England, in the late
nineteenth century when a member
of the Rugby soccer varsity became
disgusted, picked up the ball, and
ran it into the goal. Although ex-
pelled for his troubles, this young
man had provided the spark that grew
into rugby, appropriately named for
his alma mater. Rugby grew behind
the popular sport of soccer in Europe,
and eventually became widely-played
by gentlemen throughout the British
empire. Rugby failed to catch on in
football-oriented America, but re
cently has gained in popularity along
with its more orthodox cousin, soccer,
Rugby played with fifteen men
on each team, with the squad roughly

resemblance to the football backfield
The game combines the skills associat-
with tackling, running, kicking,
and passing into a fluid movement de-
signed to run the ball across the op
ponent’s goal line. Three points are
awarded for this type of score (known
“try”), two for the place-kicked
and three points for a
successful penalty kick. The ball re-
sembles an oversized football—longer,
lighter, and more blunt than its
American counterpart. It takes a cer-
tain breed of man to play rugby;
the principle involved in tackling the
football runner is employed in the
sport, except the players don’t wear
equipment. In addition, the amount of
running is comparable to soccer,
the necessity of being in shape is
apparent. So we find that stamina,
agility, size, and toughness are pre-
requisites for the ideal player. Rugby,
however, is not all brawn and blood
(although any player will attest to
the relative importance of these ele
ments); an integral part of each con
test the time-honored keg party
after the game, where grudges creat
ed during the match are drowned
along with the pain of numerous
culs and bruises.

Szlasa lauds
quick offense
of LX team

Coach Dick Szlasa of the varsity
lacrosse team admitted he had doubts
about the Blue’s offensive punch until
the practice match with Roanoke last
Saturday morning at Wilson Field.
The defense, which has been the back-
bone for the team, held fast but it
was the quick aggressive offense that
was most surprising to the W&L win.

There is no C.A.C. competition in
this sport, so W&L is in an all-class
district with other colleges and uni-
versities in this area disregarding
size. The powerhouse in this district
is consistently Washington College
but challengers include Duke, U.N.C.,
and others.

Coach Szlasa picked co-captain
Charlie Stewart as his most outstand
ing team member. “Charlie isn’t a
natural athlete, but he’s made up for
this through competiveness, which has
made me a_ believer in Charlie
Stewart,” summed up Szlasa.
