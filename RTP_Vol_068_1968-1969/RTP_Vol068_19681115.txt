Jeb Brown
Plays Lead
In ‘Bacchae’

The Troubadour Theater has
chosen as its next major production
a version of Euripides’ “The Bac-
chae,” “freely adopted for produc-
tion” from the original by Dr, J.
K. Shillington. Auditions have been
held in duPont Hall thoughout the
week for the production, which is
scheduled for December, hopefully
in a new Troubadour Theater.

In describing his work, which will
comprise the entire script of the
Washington and Lee adaptation, Dr.
Shillington reflected a desire to re-
create the Greek drama with what
he termed, “English theatrical poetry.”
This was accomplished through the
use of four different modern transla-
tions and one heavily footnoted Greek
version. (Dr. Shellington is not fa-
miliar with the actual Greek itself.)
Components of each version were
broken down, combined, sorted and
modified, much in the manner, said
Dr. Shillington, employed by Robert

Ray Prohaska,

 

Lowell in his work “Prometheus
Bound.” The end result is a modern
adaptation, extremely sincere, since
it was undertaken with an almost
total disregard of “reverence” for the
complicated ancient rhyme schemes,
that are in fact almost meaningless in
the modern theater.
Euripides’ drama dates from ap-
proximately 406-408 B.C. About the
year 300 B.C. one leaf of the manu-
script appears to have been lost.
This particular segment, dealing with
the mourning over the body of King
Pentheus, will vary from the rest of
the play in the W&L production.
Rather than rewritting from the|
works of others, Dr. Shillington creat-
ed his own scene, based upon his-
torical footnotes, to fill the void.
Troub Director Lee Kahn announc-
ed the cast early this morning. Jeb
Brown will apear as Dionysus and
Carr Garnett will play the part of
liresias. Bob Baroody won the role
of Cadmus. Hugh Hill and Dave Katz

University of Virginia Initiates

Experimental Program of Study

Students and faculty members at
the University of Virginia have inau-

According to Prohaska, he then
proceeds “to draw in pencil very free-

Although the term “monoprint”
implies one print, it is sometimes pos-

varied densities from one plate.

Motion Wins
By 10 to 1 Vote

By MAC BARR

Student Body President Jay Passa-
vant announced the final plans at
Tuesday night’s Executive Committee
meeting for a “Bitch-In” to be held
November 25 in Lee Chapel at 8 p.m.

Passavant said that the purpose of
the “Bitch-In” is to encourage stu-
dent participation in their govern-
ment on an informal basis. (See
further details on this page.)

Junior Year Abroad

The next order of business was
conducted by Judson Simmons, chair-
man of the Junior Year Abroad Com-
mittee. Simmons said the faculty's
Foreign Study Committee was “par-
ticularly interested in developing
close ties with programs offered by
neighboring or kindred institutions.”
However, Simmons reported that the
cost of setting up a private program,
if it is to function effectively, is en-
tirely beyond the means of W&L at
this time.

Presently a Washington and Lee
student may study for a year in
Europe if (1) he meets the basic
demands (2.5 gpr), (2) he has the
approval of his adviser and (3) he
is seeking participation in a program
operated by an accredited institution
there. This last qualification is neces-
sary as a guarantee that the ex-
perience will have solid academic
value in addition to its obvious values
for general purposes of education.

Integration Committee

In the latter part of the meeting,
EC vice president Danny Leonard
moved to eestablish an EC commit-
tee to “study the possibility of ex-
panding the University’s recruitment
program of qualified applicants with
the hope of widening the diversity
here among faculty and students and
ending utter homogeneity in the stu-
dent body.” In addition the motion
embodied a proposal to study integra-
tion policies in all facets of university
life “with the goal of achieving an
honest evaluation of this university's
commitment to the integration idea.”
| The motion was seconded by Joe
| Tompkins and passed by a vote of
'10 to 1. Bill Brown cast the lone
i dissenting vote. Stamen Ogilvie was
absent.
| Leonard and Peter Hendricks will
|do research for the committee.

 

Film Series Scheduled To Begin
At University On November 26

A series of ten films from all
over the globe will be presented at
Washington and Lee beginning No-
vember 26

The films are being sponsored by
Bradley Gunter, instructor in English,
and John Jennings, assisiant profes-
of journalism. They decided to
organize a film series at the beginning
this semester when they realized
that all good schools participated in
similar cultural programs. Their main
objective was to get as broad a range
of movies as possible

Already scheduled are two films
each from the United States, France
and Italy, and one film each from
Germany, Japan and Russia

The first showing will be “Wir
Wunderkinder” on November 26. It
deals satirically with the fortunes and
misfortunes of the German people
from the days of the Kaiser through
the Hitler era to the postward years

Discussion
For Lee

The Executive Committee of the
Student Body has planned a Bitch-In
for new policies or courses of action
in Lee Chapel.

The Bitch-In is being planned “in
an effort to bring to the forefront
those issues in the campus which
students feel have been neglected, and
as a means of offering suggestions
for new policies or course of action
that may be undertaken by the pres-
ent Executive Committee,” says Jay
Passavant, Student Body President.

Passavant emphasizes that the
“Bitch-In is not designed to be a
slanderous attack on student govern-
ment by dissatisfied students—instead
it is designed to give interested stu-
dents an opportunity to express views

 

and offer suggestions on matters they

The Bitch-In will be conducted as
an informal question and answer
period with the President of the E.C.
presiding. Questions or comments will
be entertained from the floor at the
outset of the meeting and any stu-
dent who so desires will have the
floor for a maximum of three minutes.
Danny Leonard, Pete Hendricks and
Steve Sandler of the E.C. will be
present to answer questions directed
to that body. Faculty members will
be permitted to attend, but they will
not be recognized from the floor.

The E.C. urges all students who
feel that more can be done by the
student government in various areas
on campus to attend the Bitch-In.

W&L Will Again Participate In

Princeton Language Program

Washington and Lee will partici-
pate again in 1969-70 in the Prince-
ton University Co-operative Under-
graduate Program in Critical Langu-
ages.

A sophomore “with a distinguished
record” may be recommended by
Washington and Lee to study Arabic,
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Persian,
Russian, or Turkish (and related reg-
ional studies) at Princeton University
during his junior year. He must en-
roll for preliminary intensive language
training at a summer institute prior
to atending Princeton. Upon complet-
ing his junior year and usually
another summer institute, he will re-
turn to Washington and Lee to com-
plete his degree work here.

Mid-Semester Reports
Released For Freshmen

Indicate Marked Drop

Mid-term grades, issued to fresh-
men this week, seem to confirm the
trend indicated by the § and U grades
released a few weeks ago.

This year there were 182 failure
notices given as of mid-semester,
compared with 121 for last year, 124
for 1966 and 74 for 1965.

Breaking these figures down, it is
found that 99 students received one
F this year, compared with 73 last
year, 54 in 1966 and 52 in 1965
The remainder of the breakdown
shows a similar patiern, with the
category of three failures the only
one in which a previous year exceed-
ed this year. In 1966 one student
received six F's, while this year the
record was only five.

Although the increase in failures
can be accounted for in part by the
increase in the number of students
in this year’s freshman class (362)
compared with previous classes (297

| in 1967), this does not fully explain

the trend, for it ignores the fact that
this year’s freshmen did appreciably
worse than the class of 1970, which
contains 320 members, did two years
ago.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Che Ring-tium Phi

Are Students Interested?

We thoroughly agree with Reed Byrum’s signed editorial
in the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi urging student body representa-
tion on the University’s Board of Trustees. A student on the
Board of Trustees would certainly be in an excellent position
to explain to this body the desires and ideas of the student
body. We believe that the benefits that could be gained by
such action would result in many important advances (much
more important than liberalizing liquor rules on campus, as
was stated in the editorial) .

However, we wonder how many students are actually
interested in the University. We wonder how many students
are willing to propose constructive ideas and take part in
seeing these ideas formulated into action. Furthermore, we
wonder why so many students who have gripes about the
operations of the University and its varied segments keep
them to themselves, not willing (or caring) to bring them out
into the open.

The student body will have an opportunity to show its
interest in the University at the Executive Committee spon-
sored “Bitch-In,” scheduled for November 25. The purpose
of this informal gathering will be to encourage student partici-
pation in their government and to bring to the forefront issues
which students feel have been ignored or forgotten. Students
will also be encouraged to make constructive proposals to the

EC.

If student body response is overwhelming (which it ought
to be), then the Board of Trustees will see that students are
interested in their school. This would encourage them to put
a student representative on the Board, On the other hand, if
response is small, we will have gained nothing and lost an
opportunity to make ourselves heard.

If we really want a voice in what is going on at Washing-
ton and Lee, we will have to go out of our way to show we
do. No one will give us additional privileges until we are will-
ing to work for them, and no one will give us more responsi-
bilities unless we prove we are willing to accept them maturely.

No Stags Allowed

We strongly believe that open fraternity parties belong at
Washington and Lee. It is this custom which brings the student
body together for social rather than academic endeavors.

However, there is one thing we strongly urge the Interfra-
ternity Council to consider in order to make these parties more
enjoyable for everyone concerned. We ask that the IFC forbid
all males without dates (commonly known as stags) from going
into any fraternity parties, other than their own, without
invitations.

There are several valid reasons why this rule should be
put into effect. First, stags generally tend to be more obnoxi-
ous than students with dates. They enter another fraternity
house as guests of that fraternity and then proceed to get
drunk and bother couples around them. It is not uncommon
to see stags jumping up and down on the furniture or see
them roaming around trying to pick up dates. These kinds of
actions and others like them can create uncomfortable and
often violent situations.

Secondly, the stags themselves may become targets for
drunken students who may be trying to impress their dates.

 

 

Letters To The Editor...

 

 

Reasoning?

To the Editor:

I was somewhat surprised to read
Mr. Honig’s statement in the Tues-
day Ring-tum Phi that Lawrence Mc-
Connell had missed the point in his
editorial of 11/8/68. I read on ex-|
pecting to find out Mr. McConnell’s |
error, but at the end of the edi-
torial | was no more informed. After
several re-readings, | thought that Mr.
Honig had not refuted Mr. McCon-
nell, but had only shifted his em-
phasis. Mr. McConnell had stated that
the difference was “...in place, not
in kind.” Mr. Honig pointed out that
there are sufficient apartments so that
any student might have ample access,
which tended to corroborate Mr. Mc-
Connell.

It appeared that Mr. Honig, in
shifting his emphasis, was attempting
to make the proposal more palatable
to both parents and faculty. A parent
might balk at his son’s having un-
limited social contact, saying he is
not yet mature enough to be tempted
by such “ripe” situations. What par-
ent, however, could say that he had
failed to instill any “decency” in his
son?

Mr. Honig also says that allowing
girls in the upper floors of a fra-
ternity house would encourage more
upperclassmen to live in, thus better-
ing the lot of fraternities, and also
providing more upperclass “guidance.”
Mr. Honig has cleverly put the fac-
ulty on the defensive, implying that
a failure to allow this rule would
deny fraternities the chance to better
themselves.

Mr. Honig started his editorial with
the unfair statement that Mr. Mce-
Connell was wrong. He does nothing
to prove his accusation, but for some
reason saw fit to include it. In fact,
in his conclusion he says that fra-
ternities want to better themselves
“ .. by using the means which are
already very much a part of life in
Lexington.” This is exactly what Me-
Connel means when he says the
difference will be “...in place, not
in kind.” Mr. Honig’s whole editorial
merely rewords Mr. McConnell’s, al-
though he says that McConnell’s was
wrong. It would seem that one in Mr.
Honig’s position and responsibility
should not make such claims, especi-
ally as he goes on to substantiate
what he has already called false.

Another Concerned Parent

To the Editor:

Permit me to comment on the
“Concerned Reply” editorial in the
Friday Ring-tum Phi. [| do so not
as a faculty member but as the father
of three girls who someday, perhaps,
will be college students. Washington
and Lee is a gentlemen's school and
a gentleman does not put a lady in

Admittedly, I did not exactly think
this way when I was an undergraduate
at Yale close to thirty years ago and

about it now. There is the under-
graduate point of view and there is

And it is no wonder. For what the
parent is saying is that sex can be

An incident like this occurred during Homecomings Weekend
and resulted in a broken cheek bone for an innocent stag.

A third reason for this rule is to keep unknown stags from |
entering the fraternity parties. Students from other campuses
often come to W&L without dates to take part in the festivi- |
ties. Stag “townies” may also decide to attend the parties. |
These two groups are more prone to make trouble because |
of their obscured identities. Whenever they do make trouble, |
W&L students bear the brunt of the blame. |

There are more examples of incidents which might have |
been averted if a rule such as the one we are asking for had
been in effect. This rule will not forbid stags from attending
their own fraternity parties. All it will do is to forbid unknown |
stags from entering the parties and allow, by invitation only,
stags who are desired by the members of the fraternity.

If we want to keep our fraternity parties open to other
students and their dates and if we want these parties to be
unmarred by unpleasant incidents, the IFC must take action
immediately.

Prejudices DO Exist

Dear Sirs:

An angry voice has been raised at
Washington and Lee in the past two
weeks—the voice of those enlightened
few who freely preach social and
especially racial “justice” to the
“bigoted” middle-class. These right-
thinking students are convinced that
it is unfair to prevent a young lady
from staying overnight in a_ hostile
atmosphere, where she is distinctly
not wanted, I certainly would not
sacrifice the comfort of a girl by
placing her in such an atmosphere.
But idealists rarely think of this con-
sideration.

Several of our more obsessed
campus liberals are indeed appalled
to find that in Lexington, relatively
“advanced” as it is, there are people
who do not like those of another
color and that there are “prejudices.”
Of course there are prejudices, even
in the United States of America, the
melting pot of the world; alas, the
melting pot did not transform all of
our various races and cultures into
one unified mass, dedicated to the
hypothesis that all men are created
equal. People are after all different
from each other, even if these dif-

ferences are only superficial; and
these differences breed dislikes and
distrust.

Maybe people have totally un-
founded reasons for their pre-
judices, but the prejudices are still
there; and though the intellectuals
are not aware of it, these are stead-
fast prejudices, for they have had
two and three hundred years to
become hardened. No amount of
praying, parading, rioting, boy-
cotting, or damning is going to re-
verse public sentiment in any fore-
seeable future.

The integrationist radical is de-
termined to erase his pet injustice at
whatever cost of law and social
peace. The national majority grows
daily more exasperated and daily
more alarmed at the battering-ram ap-
proach of racial revolutionaries who
concede no diversity of social cus-
toms in the area of race, but insist on
universal and compulsory fulfillment
of the dream of integration.

Take your dates where you please
and let them stay wherever they are
| welcome; consider your reasons for
iyour choice in overnight lodgings;
jand remember that crusaders are al-

ways arrogant, always  uniovable,
often defeated, and very often wrong.

(Editor's Note: The authors request
| that their names be withheld. It is

the editorial policy that names be
| withheld only by request and by
our own discretion. However, in
| both cases it is necessary for us to
know the writers.)

fundamental softness in the film's
head, and probably in its heart. Later
the daughter turns on the doctor for
what she considers his unwillingness
to protect her husband against blatant
white injustice. “I don't know how
good a hater | am,” she declares,
“I got a feeling I'm a mighty good
hater!” A lesson in what whites have
done to blacks? Nonsense. Self-con-
gratulation on our enlightenment at
seeing Negro “problems.”

here are similar faults through- |
out the film, culminating in that

to a manageable level, the same way

his senses are limited. All the in-
volvement he allows himself is an
occasional clearly beneficial good

turn. It’s nice to be able to do good
from an insecure position, ..

We look for the New American
Cinema in the wrong place. We like
to be told the truth, assured that the
truth we hear is true. As an audience
we want movies to held our hand.
The movies oblige, giggling shyly at
first and then dominating the rela-
tionship. We and the cinema tell
each other the same secrets, pleased
to have them on independent author-
ity. We gain knowledge without work-
ing for it. Sentimental love affairs

Seventeen Generals To Retire Again

Zeliff Leads Harriers
In Rebuilding Year

By MIKE HOSFORD |

This year’s cross-country team has |
been somewhat less than sterling, but |
there have nevertheless been several |
bright spots, the main one being co-|
captain Harry Zeliff.

Zeliff is a Phi Ep senior from
Staunton, Virginia, majoring in Eng-
lish. He has consistently been on the |
dean’s list. His perseverence is of a
stoic nature, and his hard work is
rarely known because of his modesty.
In spite of this modesty, it should be
known that he has been largely re-
sponsible for the success of the cross-

country team this year. The team
returned this year perhaps weaker
than ever after the loss of Corbet

Bryant and Bob Stack to graduation.

Zeliff’s biggest asset has been his
ability to come through in the clutch,
and over the past two years he has
done plenty of it. In his sophomore
year, his first year at cross-country,
he ran a consistent sixth or seventh

ber of problems cropped up. Ralph
Pearcy was injured and never got|
Bob Stack
also was hurt, never reaching his full
potential in his last year. Corbet
Bryant, always a steady runner, con-
tracted mononucleosis and never was
able to come back strong. Zeliff was
about the only bright spot last year,
as he consistently ran in the top three
and placed in the CAC tournament,
This year’s story has been much
the same. Ralph Pearcy has not been
in top form, and most of the sopho-
mores and others are still spotty run-
ners at best. Replacement has been
a severe problem. In addition, the loss
of both Bryant and Stack have hamp- |
ered the harriers’ hopes this season.
Zeliff has been the only runner of
real distinction, placing first in al-
most every meet this year, with a fifth
in the CAC Tournament (although

DEAN KUMPURIS (upper left)}—
a tiger in the defensive secondary.

k “Execept for two earthquakes, fly
| ing back in a snowstorm, and almost
hitting a drunk on the way home, we
had a pretty good day.”

That is how Washington and Lee
football coach Buck Leslie describes
what happened to him and the Gen-
erals last Saturday. The first earth-
quake—a real one—shook the Gen-
erals’ hotel in} Memphis Saturday
morning; the other one came in the
second half of the W&L-Southwestern
game when the Lynx exploded for a
38-7 triumph.

Coach Leslie might have mention-
ed a few other things that happened
Saturday. Like the assistant coach
who lost 19 of the airline tickets, or
the private plane which nosed over
on the runway at Winston-Salem,
delaying the W&L flight and forcing
all sorts of schedule-juggling.

But the worst was the Southwestern
earthquake which knocked the Gen-
erals out of a chance for the College
Athletic Conference co-championship.
By winning, Southwestern gained a
share of the title with Centre, Both
have finished their conference seasons
with 3-1 marks.

The Generals close out their
son Saturday at home against Wash-
ington University of St. Louis in a
battle of the also-rans. Both teams
are having down years: Washington
is 2-7 overall and 0-3 in the con-
ference, while W&L is only slightly
better at 2-5-1 and 1-2.

Coach Leslie feels the Battlin
Bears’ record is deceiving, however
“All three of their losses in the con
ference have been very close, and |
that’s what I look at. We dont
think they are weak at all.”

and I immediately forgot about the
small problems.

The transition that can be made in
a bathroom is really amazing. Totally
grubby guys would go into johns,
closets, or phone booths, and come
out dressed in tuxes or suits. A
definite revival of the old Superman-
in-the-phone-booth routine.

The snow was beautiful. Several
drivers must have enthralled by it,
as there were many cars on_ the
sides of the road, What really bother-
ed me was the traffic jam on the
median strip.

The Formal turned out to be a
success. I actually survived it with-
out any major mishaps. My usual
luck had not forsaken me _ though.
The snow was rapidly accumulating,

-|and the roads were correspondingly

getting worse. The decision was made
to find a motel room and sleep off

-|the storm. Fine, but where do you

look for a room at 2 a.m.?

World War I. In addition, to this,
Moreau has written numerous essays

zines,

like ours with the movies often end
in violence: see In the Heat of the
Night, sentimental, vicious, but ever
sO reassuring—accepted as true be-
cause it confirms that we always
thought. Films which disturb—Bon-
nie and Clyde—get turned into ads,
gags, and posters, neutralizing their
irony.

Arkin resurrects the New American
Cinema by giving a performance full
of passionate intelligence. There
sems to be no other way. If Arkin
is profoundly moving almost from
his first moment on the screen, it is
not because he sets out to move us
but because he enters his character
all the way and emerges on the other
side. Actors seldom listen the way
Arkin listens—the way a deaf-mute
listens! His movie must be seen, and
quickly.
