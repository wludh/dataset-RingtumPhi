By ROBERT 5S. JOHNSON
Faculty Contributor

A staff editorial in The Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi of November 19 seems
to have gone, if not unnoticed, un-
challenged. The editorial, entitled
“The faculty as a legislature,” sug-
gests that (1) the faculty has some-
what brazenly assumed authority over
areas of University life where it has
none and (2) the decision-making
apparatus of the faculty is not up
to the tasks confronting it. To remedy
this it is proposed that policy be made
by the president alone or that de-
cisions be made by considerably less
than the full faculty in whose cur-
rent monthly meetings differences of
Opinion tend to intrude and impede.

R. W. K., the author, has asked for
my reaction. It is one of virtually
total disagreement. The faculty is and
it seems to me, ought to remain the
fundamental shaper of university life.

The by-laws of our university make
it abundantly clear that the faculty's
scope of authority and responsibility
is wide:

The Faculty shall be responsible
for the academic regulation of stu-
dents, for entrance and graduation
requirements, for the approval and
supervision of courses of study, for
the recommendation of stuednts for
degrees, and for the discipline and
government of the students and all
student organizations. (sec.2, ch.
IV, University By-Laws.)

So it cannot be disputed that the
faculty does have authority in mat-
ters such as fraternity affairs, cur-
riculum revision, and the five-day
week, to cite those topics mentioned
in the editorial,

Should the faculty have _ this
authority? One can argue that his-
torically a university and its faculty
were thought of as one, so that the
faculty today remains the dominant
force on a campus. Granted, discus-
sion and final resolution of every non-
routine matter by the full faculty is
at times less than efficient. The al-
ternatives proposed in the editorial—
one-man rule (by the president) and
rule by an all-powerful committee of
faculty and administration elite—
would function smoothly and rapidly.

“Should not the president of the
university be given absolute authority
to construct a unified plan of cur-
riculum in line with his theories of
the liberal arts college?” asks R.W.K.,
presumably to avoid a faculty debate
certain to be lengthy. Examples of
colleges so run, while fortunately
not abundant, do exist, Let us pass
over the obvious one (Bob Jones
University) and consider Parsons Col-
lege whose curriculum was (before
loss of accreditation) the creation of
its president. The result was not the
envy of the academic world. More to
the point the violent disorder at many
reputable institutions in recent years
has been, in the views of many ob-
servers, the result of questionable ad-
ministrative decisions on curriculum
and other matters in which the fac-
ulty was denied any meaningful role.
While | am not suggesting that a
curriculum devised by our President
would be bad, it seems clear that this

sort of administrative rule ought to
be shunned,

Turning to the other alternative
proposed, ought not the faculty dele-
gate its authority to a committee of
thirty or so whose decisions would
be final? Or, should committee re-
ports be accepted automatically?
Since the size of our faculty does not
make either an absolute necessity,
the answer again is clearly no. A
committee of any legislative body can
be easily dominated by a minority
whose thinking is no where in tune
with a majority of the legislators.
(Examples abound in the congress.)
Such may not be the case here, but
on any faculty it can happen that,
no matter how conscientious and
scrupulous a committee is, its  re-
port does not turn out to be the
embodiment of the faculty will. And

University hosts
mock session of

OAS in March

A mock session of the Organiza-
tion of American States will be held
at Washington and Lee University,
March 14-15, 1969, according to
Jorge Estrada, Secretary-General of
the Model OAS.

The simulation will be of the Inter-
American Conference, the highest
legislative body of the OAS. Invita-
tions will be sent to 60 colleges and
universities to send delegates to repre-
sent each of the 23 members of
the Conference and one _ interested
party (Canada). Each delegation will
represent the foreign policy of one
country in the organization in a
manner similar to the representation
of states in the W&L Mock Con-
vention.

Interested students at Washington
and Lee will be attached to each
delegation as accredited envoys. Stu-
dents here will study the policy of the
state to which he will be attached
from material available from the em-
bassies and from the Council on In-
ternational Relations and United
Nations Affairs in New York.

Other student positions are open
on the Social Committee (for the
social event) and the General Services
and Administrative Committees. A
meeting of all students interested in
any positions on the OAS simulation
will be held in Howe 206, Wednes-
day, Dec. 18, at 9:00 p.m.

The program is sponsored by Wash-
ington and Lee University along with
the Political Science Club and the
Tuesday and Friday Ring-tum Phis.

A tentative agenda calls for a key-
note address by the present Secretary-
General of the OAS followed by
plenary sessions on Friday and Satur-
day.

Service at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity will take place at the R. E.
Lee Memorial Episcopal Church to-
morrow night at 8 o'clock.

The special service is held each year
for both the University and the
Lexington community. It consists of
nine Biblical readings by nine mem-
bers of the Washington and Lee
faculty, administration and student
body. Christmas carols are also sung
by both the WAL Glee Club and
those aitending the service.

Before the program begins, the
University’s John A. Graham Brass
Choir will give a performance.

Representing the administraion and
faculty in the readings will be Presi-
dent Robert E. R. Huntley, Dean
Roy L. Steinheimer Jr.. Maurice D.

EC may vote to alter exam

scheduling; OAS given $50

Flexible exam schedules gained the; 24, through Sunday, June 1, after

initial support of the Executive Com-
mittee in its last meeting before the
Christmas holidays. Staman Ogilvie
reported the suggestions of an EC
sub-committee composed of himself
and Bill Brown, and said the tenta-
tive proposals would be presented to
the EC for its vote of recommenda-
tion to the faculty at a later meeting.

The EC was also told that the
faculty Executive Committee 1) would
recommend to the faculty at its Janu-
ary meeting that one non-voting mem-
ber of the EC be allowed to sit with
the faculty group, and 2) indicated
it was willing to meet on a monthly
basis with the student EC for a gen-
eral interchange of ideas. The EC
was also willing.

There was lengthy debate concern-
ing three proposed Constitutional
amendments advocated by The Fri-
day Ring-tum Phi and brought to
the EC by Ron Kessler. One was
dropped; two were defeated. In other
business, the EC 1) granted a request
from Jorge Estrada that his group
forming the Mock OAS be appropri-
ated $50 for initial expenses, 2)
selected members for the new Stu-
ident Civil Liberties Committee, and
| 3) announced the student member-
| ship on the University Committee on
Intercollegiate Athletics (Gary Silver-
field was re-appointed; Drew Kum-
puris was appointed).

Exam schedule

Rob Bauer, Pete Hendricks, and
Danny Leonard were absent as the
EC heard Ogilvie’s recommendations
for pre-scheduled exam conditions
which the EC will probably soon
endorse for adoption on a trial basis
next semester.

Although Brown emphasized the
suggestions were “still in rough
form,” there was no dearth of sup-
porting evidence that the ideas were
in good use elsewhere (Mary Baldwin,
Hollins, and Randolph-Macon being
the schools mentioned which the EC
had consulted).

The system would work something
like this: each student, several weeks
before exams next spring, would indi-
cate on a card the days on which
he desired to take each of his ex-
aminations.

Exams would be given in a nine-
day period following a reading day
after the end of classes. The exam
period would be from Saturday, May

which professors would have four
days to grade the exams.

Ogilvie made it clear that students
could not change their exam periods
at will, but only in the prescribed
time a few weeks before the end of
classes. Exams, under the proposed
schedule, would be given in three
time slots each day (except Sunday,
when there would be two periods),

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion Of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Student Newspaper
Tuesday, December 17, 1968

 

We are not dealing with a ‘failure’

Honor is relative—and in these times its
definition is elusive and its range undefined.
It is this very nature which makes it impossible
to legislate against dishonor; honor and dis-
honor, integrity and the lack of integrity,
morality and immorality—who can delineate
the differences?

At Washington and Lee, tradition has
delegated the authority of maintaining the
wholly elusive quality of honor to the student
body through its Executive Committee. It has
been, is now, and will continue to be the feel-
ing of many that legislation against dishonor
in this community of fifteen hundred is not
only possible but is desirable as well. Few
temporize in honor’s favor by discussing re-
habilitative aspects: no contrition is tolerated
under the absolute penalty.

No, the general reasoning in support of
our honor system is that it affords protection
—competitive situations in the classroom are
guaranteed fairness; a student’s word is taken
without reservation; and the incidental con-
fidence in leaving apartments unlocked or
books in the quad is truly a luxury.

* ok

Due process?

At this juncture enter the critics. Some,
such as Mr. Kessler of The Friday Ring-tum
Phi, wish to amend the current honor system
by including certain due process provisions
now operative in governmental courts of law.
Perhaps these are necessary. As one of the
more competent members of the Executive
Committee, Pete Hendricks, said, some of the
honor trial procedures are legal travesties;
but Mr. Hendricks went on to point out that
Washington and Lee is a closed, private com-
munity which may govern itself almost en-
tirely as it wishes. If the procedure for trial
were to be legalized, then, would the honor
system be strengthened?

We think not. As Steve Sandler said, any-
one, given time, could make a successful bid
for acquittal on almost any honor violation
trial—guilty or innocent. The honor system’s
strength on this campus lies largely rooted in
awe (or fear) of the Executive Committee.

* *
Codified jurisdiction?

Then there are those critics who bemoan the
lack of defined limits for the EC’s jurisdic-
tion; a legitimate complaint. But how is this
to be resolved? If the EC states that its juris-
diction will encompass only the campus and
immediate environs, what if some W&L stu-
dents are caught stealing money at the Uni-
versity of Virginia? Or cheating in summer

school? On the other hand, if the EC assumes

The proposal made by Jorge Estrada et.
al. that Washington and Lee initiate and
host a mock Organization of American States
is met here with mixed feelings. The idea
behind Mr. Estrada’s purpose is surely a
noble one, that students may become more
knowledgeable about the workings of such
organizations as the OAS (and Mr. Estrada
indicated he would like to change the group
under study each year) and more aware of
international problems, We, too, will support
his efforts in this regard; who are we to stand
in the way of those who would widen narrow
vistas? * ‘

Requesting all the budget

Unfortunately, the situation is not quite so
black-and-white. Mr. Estrada has asked the
Executive Committee to appropriate $500 to
$600 for his endeavor. Now we do not intend
to discuss the flux of student body funds—
they are overseen, incidentally, by Danny
Leonard, who has demonstrated his fiscally-
sound discretion in handling those funds.

But such a request is indeed ridiculous,
especially in light of the fact that no W&L
student will be allowed to represent a country.

limitless jurisdiction, would they in fact dis-
miss a student for stealing a parking sign
at Hollins? Or lying to a Draft Board in
Chicago?

There are many who see the honor system
as something it is not, who see it as what
they imagine it to be. Some assume it is
entirely idealistic, upholding the greatest of
all virtues. Others envision its role as com-
pletely pragmatic, a convenient and hand-
some backdrop for those not “aware” enough
to accept the protection rationale.

To us, it is a mixture of both, a quixotic.
romantic yet stringently durable code which
sets this University’s 1,438 students and 12,-
000 alumni on a proud pedestal of self-
regulated integrity.

* *

Coincidental or damnable?

And thus it was somewhat disquieting for
us to read in The Friday Ring-tum Phi, under
a rather large headline proclaiming “The
Honor System Is A Failure,” that “This first
article was composed before The Tuesday
Ring-tum Phi was printed this week. Any
similarity between its article and this one is
purely coincidental.”

Damnable would be a better word. For the
honor system is not a failure; indeed, its
strength will be enhanced as transient weak-
nesses are worked out among the Executive
Committee. We thoroughly agree with Mr.
Kessler, who wrote last Friday:

We do not intend to beg you to care about your
Honor System. But if it does mean something to you
and you wish it to remain a strong and workable
force on campus, then we feel you are obligated to
see that its weaknesses are ironed out....

This is your Honor System. It can be strengthened
only by your support and interest. This is too im-
portant an issue to be ignored.

It is for those and other reasons this edi-
tion called for Mr. Kessler’s resignation. And
it is for those reasons this edition refuses
to call the honor system a failure. Its imple-
mentation may fall short of success; certainly
it is entirely consistent with this edition’s
editorial policy to make that statement. Our
request is that the Executive Committee set
for itself the conditions under which it will
judge a question of honor, and further that
the twelve gentlemen set for themselves the
criteria which constitute a violation.

* *

Jury of our peers?

The men of the EC are not our peers;
they are, by their election to that position,
our leaders in questions of honor. We call
upon them to exercise their power by decid-
ing how the system shall be enforced, and
then, most importantly, to so enforce this

Randolph-Macon’s authority on mock events
Miss Tompkins tried to convince the EC that
there would be involvement by students here
since “several hundred would be doing re-
search on the 24 countries, to be used by

the various delegations.”
* ’

Not many will volunteer

We challenge Miss Tompkins to find sev-
eral hundred W&L students who will be will-
ing, on their own (i.¢., not as a requirement
for a course), to research data on a country,
hand it over to someone from another col-
lege, sit by as these people have all the fun,
and then applaud the EC’s alloting student
body funds for the affair.

We are not condemning Mr. Estrada or
his idea; we are, however, suggesting that
funds for the simulated convention could be
secured from other sources—from the de-
partments which would likely be interested,
such as political science and history, or per-
haps by raising the required registration fees
paid by participating colleges. It is too good
an idea to be dropped because of a lack of
money, but it allows too narrow a participa.
tion to debit student body funds,

 

Horowitz blasts EC

but defends some members and ideas

Washington Hall is one of those].

nerve center type buildings from
which the world is run. President
Huntley’s suite of offices is there.
You pay your money to the treasurer
and you take your chances there.
Your application for admission is
favorably received there and if your
connections are ever severed, I guess
that happens there too,

It is from the top floor of Wash-
ington Hall that this year’s Executive
Committee operates. Almost every
Monday night, sometime around 7:15
p.m.—after “Goodnight David; Good-
night Chet: and Goodnight for NBC
news” has spoonfed America the news
of the day—another meeting of the
Executive Committe is gaveled to
order by Student Body President Jay
Passavant.

In the third floor history seminar
room this elected group of select men
sit to ponder the problems of the past
and to legislate against the problems
of the future. A history seminar
room: the Congress of Vienna is dis-
cussed during the daylight hours and
when evening comes it is acted out.

Every attempt is made by the ad-
ministration to the University to im-
press upon “us students” that Wash-
ington and Lee is more than just
classroom activity. Those before-
dawn 8:25s and the seminars that
run till dinner time are not meant
to be the limits to learning at W&L.
The Mock convention gives students
the opportunity to feel the real-life
despair that results from political
activity. Student Newspapers, maga-
zines, yearbooks provide a wealth of
experience for the participating stu-
dents. Contact is a means of taking
the ideas born in the classroom and
seeing how they live and die in the
real world. The W&L catalogue tells
us that the university has recognized
for years the contribution to student
life made by participatory student gov-
ernment.

But the catalogue also warns us
against mistakenly assuming that
learning is a passive process. In some
of the finest catalogue prose we are
reminded:

It should be remembered, however,
that the burden of responsibility
in higher education is not the col-
lege’s alone. Few, if any, of the
processes of learning take place
automatically for a student in col-
lege. The young man (that’s us)
must recognize and accept his re-
sponsibility to take maximum ad-
vantage of the opportunity offered
there. (Ihat’s here!)

Participation, plus

So, the Executive Committee is in
part to give us the opportunity to be-
come involved in the legislative and
hopefully the democratic process that
is America, In addition, the Executive
Committee deals with very relevent
issues: issues that affect student life
on campus. The EC worked for a
five day week. Now that is past. The
EC is working for an open exam
schedule. This is now present. The
question is the future. A_ totally
integrated academic community with-
in an integrated geographical setting
might be next, although it is against
tradition, The Honor trial procedure
may be revamped. The EC may be
split into an executive honor council
and a legislative body,

Participation in high school stu-
dent governments was for your col-
lege record. Participation here is for
the life you want to lead now that
you are here...

Most students at Washington and
Lee would like the liberty to live a
free and worthwhile life. Liberty is
traditional too! But like a club tie
or “gold cup” socks, it has its price.
Liberty has been on sale in Vir-
ginia before; Thomas Jefferson long
ago: “The price of liberty is eternal
vigilance.” And | do not think he
meant Anti-Ballistic Missle systems.

Vigilance means participation. . .

To participate efficiently one must
be educated and enlightened .. .

There's that catalogue again!

Jefferson had some things to say
about the role of those who govern
as well; “I know of no safe de-
pository of the ultimate powers of
the society but the people themselves;
and if we think them not enlightened
enough to exercise their control with
a wholesome discretion. the remedy
is not to take it from them, but to
inform their discretion.”

Who needs a microphone?

Hut when the EC can look around
its meeting room and see very few
imterested students, they fee! justified
in chuckling about their future meet-
ing room in the new student union
that will have seating facilities for
spectators and an amplification sys

LETTERS

Ray Hartwell
has second thoughts

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

While I deplore the action of Mr.
Kessler in not acknowledging the
source of his editorial, I must with-
draw my endorsement of the peti-
tion calling for his resignation. It is,
I suppose, appropriate that I mention
my reasons for this decision. The most
important ones follow.

Firstly, | was not fully aware of the
ruling of the Publications Board at
the time of my signing, either in re-
spect to Mr. Kessler or to Mr. Honig.
Secondly, while deploring Mr. Kes-
sler’s action, I could not help but
be repulsed by the “lynch-mob” fash-
ion in which the petition was used.

Insofar as the Honor System is
concerned, any reevaluation must be
conducted (or at least instigated) by
the Executive Committee. To chal-
lenge the decisions of the E.C. con-
cerning the Honor System (outside of
channels provided) is to undermine
that System.

Is legality necessary?

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Having come to Washington and
Lee from a university where an honor
system was non-existent if was a
significant change to enter a situa-
tion where cheating was not a way
of life, where petty thievery was not
rampant, and where the only credit
reference a man needed was his
word. Accordingly | read with some
apprehension the remarks of both
Mr. Hendricks and Mr. Walker con-
cerning a reevaluation of the honor
system.

The honor trial itself may contain
some of the obvious trappings of a
trial at law but, however, any analogy
should cease there, The attempt to
place upon the system any more of
these can do no more than burden
the honor system and those who ad-
minister it with a pseudo-bureaticratic

maize of regulations, guidelines, and

warnings that must be administered
before a question of a breech of
honor can be settled, And to apply
Mr. Hendrick’s warnings, which bear
more than a passing resemblance to
those handed down in Miranda vy,
Arizona, 384 U.S, 436 (1966), is to
prostitute the system to needless
change for change’s sake. Adding to
the seeming confusion that already
exists within the honor system by al-
tempting to apply United States
Supreme Court rulings, whose own
basis in the law is somewhat quest
ionable, is no way to strengthen the
sysiem for the future, It is instead
the way to stifle its very life in the
present

Generals trounce Guilford
in raucous Doremus upset

By JOHN ROBINSON
and JEFF CARPER

Last night a strong Guilford Col-
lege basketball team invaded Doremus
Gymnasium only to be stunned by
WAL 94-76. Washington and Lee
showed the explosive offense and
tenacious defense that has won them
six straight victories. The Generals
played their best game to date ap-
propriately against their toughest
opponent to date.

On Saturday, the cagers defeated
visiting North Carolina Methodist in
a game which wasn’t nearly so close
as the score, 80-72, indicated. How-
ever, this definitely couldn't be con-
strued as one of the Generals better
games. Play was often sloppy on both
sides and there were only sporadic
moments when the Blue looked sharp.

At first the going was easy for the
Generals and by the end of the first
half the Blue held a commanding
50-31 edge. Employing a full court

 

games.

press early in the game, the Generals
were able to force some Methodist
turnovers and convert them to bas-
kets. Mel Cartwright put in three driv-
ing layups in pacing the Generals’
early spurt, scoring 18 points in the
first half,

The second half was a completely
different story. It was perhaps the
worst twenty minutes of play that
WAL has put forth this year. The
Blue lost the ball on numerous turn-
overs and watched their lead gradu-
ally dissipate before a steady Metho-
dist onslaught. Although W&L used
a variety of defenses, they were un-
able to stop visiting center Jim Darden
who threw in 24 points in the second
stanza, mostly from right underneath
the basket. Complementing him were
Methodist forwards Roy Henderson
and Tom Bell who sank some occas-
ional outside shots. With 6:30 re-
maining on the clock, N.C.M. had
closed the gap to 69-63. Charlie Stone

 

Sounding off .. .

Minks deafen

By ROY CARLTON

There necessarily comes a_ time
when every writer must eat a little
crow. Right now I'm eating it, but
1 couldn't be happier. In my first
column of the year, | took to task
the WAL student for his apathy in
the opening football game against
Guilford. Time has come for a fe-
traction,

Last night, Mink sports fans proved
how devoted they could be as they
disassembled Guilford almost as badly
as the Generals did down on the
floor, The number of standing ova-
tions they gave their team defies
counting. And, for the first time with-
in memory, they completely drowned
out the Quakers’ girl cheerleaders
with an unbelievable chorus of boos.
Gone was any detachment from the
game. The Minks felt for their team.

After that 20-5 season two years
ago, WAL rooters began to develop
an apathy toward winning just as
bad as the one they'd had toward
losing. They rarely cheered for their
team, instead they spent most of
their time riding the opposing squad,
Last night they found the best of
both worlds. Coach Jerry Steele of
Guilford took an amazing amount
of razzing, yet the screams for the
Blue were even louder, Groups of
students felt no restraint at all in
getting up and leading cheers

If anything, a rivalry seems to be

developing to see who can yell
loudest. The Delis occupying the east

stands led most of the cheers, while |

the SPE’s in the balcony above them
held fast to their title as the rowdiest
fans.

Make no mistake, the crowd had
a great deal to do with the win.
The home court advantage they gave
the Generals was immeasurable. The
Quakers couldn't help but be shaken,
nor could it have failed to hearten
the Blue.

Guilford’s loss last night was the
worst they have suffered in three
years. Before last night, they were
nationally ranked, A pair of victories
Thursday and Friday nights in the
WAL Invitational Tournament would
bring the Generals’ record to 8-1,
Under those circumstances, it is hard
to imagine Washington and Lee not
picking up some votes in next week's
small college rankings. It may be
that the Blue are finally headed to
their long-anticipated NCAA bid, but
a lot still lies in the future, like
Navy. In the meantime, the fans can
do their share toward helping by
putting on more shows like last night.

The visitors, however, refused to

sophomore Bill Rhyne drew three
fouls and coolly tossed in four of
five attempts to kill the Methodist

threat as time ran out,

W&L had only two more goals
than North Carolina, but made a
blistering 18 of 20 foul shots. Mel
Cartwright led W&L with 5 points
while Charlie Stone and Mike Neer
added 17 and 16 points respectively.
Cartwright, Neer, and Mike Daniels
helped the Generals to hold an ad-
vantage over N.C. in rebounds. Jim
Darden played an outstanding sec-
ond half, ending up with 36 points
for the night to pace N.C.

Last year Guilford was nationally
ranked in small colleges and had one
of the nation’s most potent offenses.
The Quakers not only have a hot
run and gun offense but also have
good height with a back line of 6-6,
6-6, and 6-3 with boys 6-10 and 6-8
in reserve.

In the first half teamwork was the
key to success as WAL jumped out
to a 39-34 lead. The Generals moved
the ball well while Guilford was
plagued with turnovers. The tough
defense by WAL stopped Guilford’s
lightning fast break and forced them
to work for good shots. Stu Fauber
and Norwood Morrison were hot
from the outside as Mel Cartwright
and Mike Neer teamed up for points

The simplest means of participating
in student government is to vote on
officers and on issues as the elections
are held. One benefit from a demo-
cracy is that when you are unhappy
with those who are “in” you can
“throw the rascals out.” But unless
you are educated as to the opinions

will you be able to tell who the
rascals are; and if there are any at

There are some good men on the

constituency.

I'm a senior. Bill Brown and Rob

disagreed with both of these men on
certain issues. But Rob Bauer is
a conscientious representative. Bill
Brown misses meetings and comes
late,

In the light of recent controversy,
the EC is seriously studying its activi-
ties to see if they might be improved.
It has been a crucial time for all of
us at WAL. Bill missed the meeting
on December 2. He was at the basket-
ball game. The following week the
meeting was held on Tuesday. Bill
wanted to miss that meeting in order
to study for a test. Passavant strongly
suggested that he stay. During the
meeting I felt that I knew where
Bill Brown really was: I had been
there Freshman year during most of
my 8:25 Math classes. It was during
this meeting that a resolution for a
change in the procedure of an Honor
rial was submitted to a vote and
passed. The Honor system at Wash-
ington and Lee was altered that
night—and if my representative had
his way, he would not have been
there to vote on the change.

Last night the EC met again. Bill
was there. Thanks! But he was late.
The first order of business was trans-
acted. A vote was called for. Bill
did not vote. “I couldn't very well
vote. I didn’t hear the discussion.”

tion that was voted on. It was for

Sandler's committment

During the December 10th meet-
ing, with the motion regarding honor
trial procedure, an issue was raised
that calls into question the effective-
ness of the Executive Committeemen
as representatives of the student body.
The motion called for tape recordings
of EC honor trials to be considered
admissable evidence in an appeal if
the defendant decided not to testfy
before a student body hearing. Dur-
ing the discussion of this motion it
was suggested by one member that
the motion be passed because it would
help to protect the decision of EC
before the student body. It was only

Steve Sandler who spoke out and
suggested that it would be more
consistent with the role of the EC
if they concern themselves with the
protection of the interests and the
rights of the student involved. His
statement received some approving
murmurs, a few nods, but the motion
was passed one vote shy of unanimity
—his vote.

Perhaps there are juniors who dis-
agree with Sandler, the junior EC
representative. Perhaps there are
other students who disagree with the
final decision of the EC on this mo-
tion. The educated and enlightened
participant in a representative demo-
cracy would find out the “why” of
his representative’s vote.

Double honor standard

The resolutions proposed last night
attempted to ensure the protection
of the individual during an EC honor
hearing. Perhaps a double standard
exist? A different procedure when
there is a different interest at stake?
Should there be any diffeernce at all
between the interest of the EC in an
Honor trial and the interest of the
defendant?

With the help of that friend of
all Freshman history students, the
Barnes and Noble College Outline
Series (no, 12), 1 recently discovered
that the Congress of Vienna in 1815
attempted to preserve the ancien re-
gime of the European powers in the
face of Liberalism which favored
political, intellectual, and economic
freedom for the individual. This de-
fense of vested interests was not
successful. There certainly are les-
sons to be learned outside of the
classroom.

from 9 until 12 a.m., from 2 until
5 p.m., and from 7 until 10 p.m.

The logistics of distributing, sort- |
ing, and collecting the exams would |
be handled by a central examination |
committee, which would employ 1) |
no student help, 2) secretarial as-|
sistance when possible, and 3) pro- |
fessorial direction at the beginning |
and end of each 3-hour exam period. |

For those courses in which indi-|
vidual exams would be impractical
(such as fine arts), arrangements |
would be made in advance under
conditions similar to those in effect
now. In the case of those exams on
which professors expect more than
3 hours to be spent, action in what-
ever form, the EC decided, would as
a matter of course come from the
faculty.

The Executive Committee indicated
that if it passed such a proposal, it
would require that all examinations
be taken within the academic build-
ings, and that—since exams for all
students in one particular class would
be the same—no discussion of exams
take place during the entire 9-day
period,

second half by driving and moving
the ball well. But the remarkable
Mel Cariwright who was the high
scorer with 25 points and the scrap-
ping of all the Generals on the boards
and on defense kept W&L in front.
With time running out the Quakers
tightened up their defense and got a
few quick baskets to close the gap,
with John Dixon a sophomore for-
ward for Guilford hitting well from
the floor. Guilford’s full-court press
came too late to halt the rampaging
Generals. And it was an impressive
25 for 39 at the foul line that was
the real reason for Washington and
Lee's big win.

A packed gym witnessed WAL’'s
margin climb to a phenominal 18
points. Sensational plays by Mel Cart-
wright and Charlie Stone (7 points)
along with the hot shooting of Nor-

wood Morrison (21 points) and Stu |

Fauber (18 points) brought the fans
to their feet on several occasions.
Equally as impressive was the re-
bounding and defense of Mike Neer

Bill Rhyne. With two minutes left

and the crowd assured of victory a
chorus of the “Washington and Lee

Yesterday Coach Verne Canfield
stated that the Generals must rebound
well, stop the high-geared offense of
their opponent and control the ball
to stop Guilford. Coach Canfield
would quickly add one thing—hitting

him a very happy man last evening.

Proposed amendments

Ron Kessler brought before the
EC three proposed Constitutional
amendments which had been set forth
in an editorial in The Friday Ring-tum
Phi last week,

For our readers’ background in-
formation, any proposed amendment
presented to the EC with 50 signa-
tures must be submitted to the student
body for vote in a referendum. If
the EC approves the proposals, by
two-third vote two times, the ref-
erendum must net 50% approval to
pass. If the EC votes nay, then 75%
approval is needed for the changes
to go into effect.

The first proposed amendment was
that “Any student convicted of an
honor violation is guaranteed the
right of appeal by student body hear-
ing.

This first proposal attracted light |
by |

reaction, generally disfavorable,
the EC on the grounds that it would
perhaps create problems for the
special sub-committee investigating
possible revisions to the entire honor
procedure. Passavant indicated that
the sub-committee (Messrs. Hendricks,
Passavant, Prof. McThenia, and Pres.
Huntley) may come forward with
some recommendations making appeal
through a different route the rule,
as opposed to appeal through  stu-
dent body hearing.

Kessler, though he said he saw
the need for this interim protection,
half-heartedly agreed not to press the
point on this proposal.

The Executive Committee began to
become more heated in its discussion
over the second proposed Constitut-
ional amendment: “Any student ac-
cused of an honor violation must be
informed of the specific charges
against him at least 24 hours prior
to his hearing before the Executive
Committee.”

Kessler said he supported this pro-
posal because it allowed accused stu-
dents to have time to formulate a
defense in their behalf.

The adverse reaction took several
routes: |) if you're innocent
you don't need to worry about a
defense because, according to several

members of the EC, it is nearly im-
possible to be convicted and be in-
nocent at the same time; 2) such a
proposal would allow many guilty
people more time to develop an air-
tight lie; and 3) the proposal would
also possibly jeopardize the sub-com-
mittee’s recommendations.

Kessler insisted that students should
be allowed to have some voice in the
procedural matters of honor, and
Steve Sandler supported him on. this
point (though not many others). It
was pointed out that the Constitution
gives “sole jurisdiction” to questions
of honor to the EC,

A vote was taken by the EC on
this second proposal, There were no
votes in favor, nine opposed, no
abstentions. Jay Passavant did point
out, however, that any accused per-
son may secure for himself additional
time, for whatever reason, if he so
requests; each accused person is ask-
ed by the EC before a trial if he is
prepared to testify.

Jay Passavant described the third
proposed amendment as one which
would “change the entire honor trial
process.” The proposal read: “Each
student is guaranteed the right of
conducting his own defense at an
Executive Committee hearing. This
includes the rights (personally or
through an advocate) of facing and

cross-examining his accusers, and of

calling and questioning witnesses in
his own behalf.”

The EC blasted Kessler with re-
buttals that the functions of prosecu-
tor and defense attorney are not those
of the EC, that the EC is not in
business on a legal trial basis, and

that an accused person may face
(though not question) his accusers
anyway.

Kessler replied—though the dis-

cussion was quite lengthy—that he
wanted to constitutionally guarantee
these rights for students. The ques-
tion was called, and the motion to
endorse the proposals was defeated,
none in favor, eight opposed, and
one abstaining (Phil Thompson).

Passavant said, however, that the
ideas in all three proposals would
be presented to the sub-committee,
and he “guaranteed” they would be
given close attention,

It was not clear whether Kessler
would present the 3 proposals to the
Executive Committee with 50 signa-
tures, or whether he would wait until
the sub-committee had reported (prob-
ably sometime next February).

Funds for OAS

Jorge Estrada, originator (last
week) of the idea for a Mock
Organization of American States at
Washington and Lee, appeared be-
fore the Executive Committee to re-
quest $50 with which to buy stamps
and paper for preliminary mailings.

After brief discussion, Steve Sandler
moved that the EC appropriate the
funds to Estrada’s project, to be re-
paid if possible. The motion passed
and the funds were granted. (The
volte on the motion was 8 in favor,
none opposed, and one abstention by
virtue of being late to the meeting).

erties Committee, on which a mem-
ber of the EC will sit, selected its

port, on Passavant’s direction, at the
first EC meeting in February.

Elected to the committee were Ron
Abrams, Hank Graddy, Steve Sharp,

The next Executive Committee
meeting will be Monday night, Janu-
