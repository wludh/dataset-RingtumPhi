THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Take Full Advantage Of Resources The KRing-tum Phi

The best ambassadors that Washington and Lee (or any
university) has are its students and its faculty. These are the
people that prospective students look at most carefully before
they decide to apply here. Prospective students are intelligent
enough to realize that the students and faculty are the essence
of the University. With this in mind, it is evident that these
groups can be very influential in convincing high school stu-
dents to apply to and attend W&L.

But what have these two groups been doing for W&L’s
recruiting? Virtually nothing. With the number of applica-
tions being submitted to W&L falling in proportion to the
number of students interested in attending private colleges,
there is an immediate need for these two groups to aid the
admissions department and become actively involved in
recruiting.

The advantages of having students participate in this
endeavor are evident. There are many students from different
areas of the country which cannot possibly be covered by
our admissions department. These students could go back
to their high schools and meet with high school juniors who
show some interest in W&L. The W&L students would not
interview students, but would answer questions concerning
student academic and social life here. (This is done to a certain
extent now, but usually between friends.) W&L students
could also take with them copies of the University catalogue
to distribute around the high schools.

Besides raising the interest of the high school students, this
would also acquaint high school guidance counselors with
We&eL. Although we send out thousands of catalogues each year
to high schools, only a few guidance counselors know enough
about W&L to recommend us to prospective students.

The meetings between the W&L recruiters and the high
school students and guidance counselors may be set up during
activities periods, so as not to interfere with school work. In
addition, with the cooperation of alumni chapters in their locali-
ties, student recruiters may arrange informal gathering after
school hours. These gatherings might include prospective stu-
dents from other high schools in the area.

There is no reason why we cannot make use of our prestigi-
ous debating teams to stir up interest. We have learned of
high school debates put on by W&L which left the students
highly impressed. We have also learned that the debating team
has offered to put on other debates in high schools, but did
not because no one would make the proper arrangements.

In this recruiting process, we should also concentrate on
attracting underprivileged and black students here. W&L stu-
dents from certain economic and social backgrounds would
be more suitable to go into schools in ghetto and slum areas
than would well-dressed admissions officers. These students,
being able to communicate better with the underprivileged
and black high schoolers, could relate to them the advantages
of W&L and what the school has to offer in the form of
academic and financial aid. Ideally, the student recruiter would
be able to offer advice from his personal experience about

Welcome, Mock O. A. S.

The Friday Ring-tum Phi is proud to be associated with
the Model Inter-American Conference of the Organization
of American States session which convenes today, and we wel-
come all the delegates to Washington and Lee.

The fact that the Mock O.A.S. Session is meeting today
is, to many observers, a surprise. When the idea for this session
was first conceived by senior Jorge Estrada of Colombia, many
thought it was a good idea but doubted whether it would
ever get off the ground. Well, it has gotten off the ground.
And when the session adjourns tomorrow night, more than
75 W&L students (although many more could have partici-
pated) and 40 students from other universities will have par-
ticipated,

This is a real tribute to the organizers of the session, who
include Hank Graddy, John Motsinger, Pat Arey and Tom
Blanton. In addition, Political Science Instructor Jim Loesel
and Professor of History Leon Sensabaugh have provided
invaluable assistance.

We urge anyone who wants to learn more about the
politics of the Western Hemisphere to attend the O.A.S.
sessions on the second floor of McCormick Library. The ses-
sions are open to the public and promise to deal with interest-
ing and controversial issues.

ways an underprivileged student could pay for his education
here.

The point is that we must make enormous efforts to com-
municate with these underprivileged and black students to
show them they are wanted at W&L and that W&L will aid
them in any way possible. We must go to them; they won’t
come to us.

These unofficial student recruiters will work on a voluntary
basis (through some exceptions may be made to help finance
certain trips) during vacation periods. In this way, classes and
studies will not be interrupted. In the end, the main purpose
of these students will be to encourage prospective applicants
to visit W&L to see the school and be interviewed (for un-
deprivileged students this trip might be financed by the Uni-
versity or the Executive Committee) .

Members of the faculty might operate in the same manner
as the students. Indeed, many members of the faculty, like
the students, haxe expressed a desire to help recruiting, but
have never been asked to. The faculty could also be used
to discuss important problems and questions parents might
have.

According to James D. Farrar, Director of Admissions,
a program similar to the one described above was attempted
seven years ago with no outstanding results. However, we
contend that a program carefully mapped out by the Office
of Admissions or by the Executive Committee (University of
Virginia’s student council has just set up a similar program)
will definitely increase the interest high school students have
in W&L. Let’s take full advantage of the resources available to
W&L and use them proudly and sensibly.

Request for Gold Bathtub

Dear Editor:
Reference is made to the article
of February 28th which called at-

tention to the slum area in Lexing-
ton. | was startled to learn that |
had been living in the slum for some
11 or i2 years now. I would like
to submit that | have been happy
living in the Lexington slum and so
far as | know there are others who
have been happy including the late
Chancellor of W&L.

But, since | am apparently one of
the slum dwellers, | wish to com-
ment on the letters of “Name With-
held” and Professor Hodges, It seems
to me that I might be considered
typical. Before attention was called
to my plight | had been unaware of
it and it did not disturb me. Now,
of course, | am ready for revolution
like any other of the “lower classes”
who have been stirred up by political
agitators. The main characteristic of
the reformer is that he dearly loves
to discover trouble where none existed
before. Now I propose to demand that

 

lthe “Federal government do some-
| thing.” In particular, they should re-

place my “slum” dwelling by a palatial
mansion and then make my landlord
‘rent it to me for the same price |
now pay. As a start, may I suggest
an inlaid gold bathtub? I never

Praise To School Board

Dear Editor:

| think it noteworthy and deserv-
ing of praise, if one considers the
decision February 20 of the Joint
Rockbridge-Lexington school board
to institute procedures to arrive at a
fair and equitable curriculum in their
schools. Too long has the black man
been denied the right to learn in
school of his American culture, which
is integral to every citizen’s culture
The school board voted unanimously
last night to work immediately to-
wards giving an adequate viewpoint
in education to the black man’s role
in society,

There was in Lexington, before
February 20’s meeting, some talk of
threats that a demonstration would
be held if the requests of the black
students weren't met. | was the one
who secured the permit from the
mayor to hold a demonstration. How-
ever, the demonstration was never
meant to be a threat or a lever to
anyone. We met the night before the
Board met and called off the demon-
stration, We meant for the demonstra-
tion to make people aware of the
problem, but the action became un-
necessary when the Board became
aware of the situation, Last night
they passed the proposed requests
of the black students after a lively
and open discussion that found us
all very much in accord. They did
not pass the requests out of fear

2nd ‘Bitch-In’
May Emphasize

Honor Reforms

By JAY PASSAVANT

President of the Student Body

On Wednesday, March 19th, the
Student Body will have a special op-
portunity to voice its feelings about
the current status of the Honor Sys-
tem as it exists at Washington and
Lee. Many questions, which should be
of interest to all students, will be
raised concerning procedural and
jurisdictional policies now followed by
the E.C. and special attention will
be given to the proposed changes
which now confront the Executive
Committee

This “Bitch-In” will be conducted
ina manner similar to the previous
forum held last November, The Presi-
dent of the E.C. will briefly explain
the reasons why the proposed changes
and what they will
entail. After each point is made, any
student wishing to express view
point will be given the floor of the
meeting and his point will be spoken
to by a member of the E.C.

We realize that it is difficult’ for
students who have had no experience

Battle Saturc

Davidson”

Cole Field House in College Park,
Maryland was the scene of the first
round of the NCAA Eastern Regional
playoffs last night. It brought pretty
much what was expected as David-
son knocked off St. John’s and North
Carolina squeaked by a_ tenacious
Duquesne team which was tenth-rank-
ed in the nation,

Davidson combined its usual power
and finesse to easily whip St. John’s
79-69 in the opener last night. Be-
hind the shooting of 67° Mike Maloy,
who scored 35 points, Davidson never
gave up the lead, and Maloy was the
main reason for Davidson’s domina-
tion of the game,

St. John’s got into foul trouble
early trying to contain Maloy and

they were always in serious trouble
after that, and that cleared the way
for Maloy to attack the basket with
little Opposition.

Davidson jumped out to a 9-2 lead
at the start of the game, but Mike
Warren of St. John’s hit for 16
points in the first half to bring the
Redmen within one point of David-
son at the half

The second half opened with a
quick scoring spree in which Maloy

and Cooke combined to score ten
points to put Davidson ahead by 11
points with fifteen minutes remain-
ing.

contributing to Davidson’s success

Carolina

Second ranked North Carolina got
off to a rather shaky start in its game
with tenth ranked Duquesne last night
at the University of Maryland, host
to the NCAA Eastern Regional play-
offs. Both teams started out with
large number of turnovers and low
shooting percentages.

Duquesne played a slower brand
of ball than Carolina, and had heav-
ier men to beef up its already tough
defense under the boards. A pair of
6°10” twins, named Nelson, provided
both defense and scoring punch to
help Duquesne pull into the ball
game again in the 2nd half.

Mel Cartwright and
two of Washington and
indispensable players, have been
chosen for the 1969 Virginia All-
Small College basketball team.

Cartwright, a 6-5 junior, and Neer,
a 6-7 junior, make up part of the
altitudinous team’s front line, along
with Frank Allen of Roanoke. The
two gaurds chosen were Old Do-
minion’s Dick St. Clair and Randolph-
Macon’s Darrell Morris.

Cartwright was the high scorer dur-
ing W&L’s 18-5 season, scoring an
average of 19 points per game. Neer
averaged 18.4 points per game.

In all, the team is extremely strong
in all areas. It is endowed with scor-
ing power, board strength and back-

court skill, The team’s shooting
ability is one of the strongest yet

Cartwright sank 56 per cent of his

floor shots, Neer 52 per cent, and
St. Clair 54 per cent. Allen and

Furthermore, both geographically
and physically, the “others are doing
it” argument is, to borrow a_ term,
“irrelevant.” There are four excel-
lent girls’ schools in the immediate
vicinity—within 50 miles, with a total
enrollment of about 3100. This can-
not be said for either Yale or for
Princeton. To go co-ed with the
existing physical plant would men

chance of getting “better” students by
letting the others go co-ed. We can-
not, then, compare our situation to

However, just as long hair does not

it be said that the presence of girls

would increase intellectual curosity,
Rather, it would be less stimulating,
Class discussion would, because of

our “irrelevant” tradition of courtesy,
be toned down. And the distractions
caused by the female presence would
far exceed any stimulation- intellect-

Perhaps, finally, there are many
among us who see beyond the initial
novelty of coeduction a multitude of
problems and disadvantages. Dormi-
tory facilities are limited, and enroll-
ment is already at capacity, a prob-
lem discussed above. There are no
separate rest room facilities in many
campus buildings. What about recrea-
tion? A co-ed locker room? And this
only scratches the surface!

In a long-term development pro
gram, coeducation may indeed be in
our future. It is my feeling, however,
that, after considering the problems,
one cannot honestly advocate coedu
cation at Washington and Lee. And
those who want it can easily find it
