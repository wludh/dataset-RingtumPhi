“The way

I see it’

By REEVE KELSEY
News Editor

The IFC in one quick vote last
night eliminated all of the work and
thought devoted to deferred rush by
its own deferred rush committee. The
IFC with only two houses dissenting
voted to tentatively endorse the Hos-
ford-Stovall plan for limited contact,

[his plan is essentially a compro-
mise plan and as such it does not
have the advantages to the fraterni-
ties of the no contact plan or the
advantages to the freshmen of an
unlimited contact. This plan will work,
but its results wil be disastrous. Be-
sides no provision for fair distribu-
tion of the freshmen during the four
parties they are allowed to go to, the

fraternity itself has no idea how
many are coming to the party. The
mechanics of the parties are now

written so loosely as to be disad-
vantageous to the nine houses away
from campus. If the mechanics of the
parties are tightened to create so ad-
vance control over who is coming
and who is not, the ensuing bureau-
cracy becomes almost prohibitive.

1 myself would rather spend the
four party weekends partying, not

rushing. If the purpose of the party |

weekends is to rush the freshmen, I
would much rather do in under the
deferred rush committee plan at the
end of the first semester. If the pur-
pose of the party weekends is to
provide the freshmen a place to party,
then it seems that the IFC has adopt-
ed the concept that the social life
of all the students at W&L is the
responsibility of the fraternities, when,
in fact, this responsibility is the Uni-
versity’s. Why not put pressure on
the University to improve the dormi-
tory and social facilities.

rhe Hosford-Stovall plan is open|

to the dangers of “combo escala-
tion,” and the “beer only” rule for
freshmen is one of the more ridcul-
ous attempts of the whole proposal.
Are the freshmen going to appreciate
being served beer; will the fraterni-
ties not find some way to give their
favored rushees something other than
beer anyway? The authors of the
plan seem assured that $18 a man

is sufficient to replace the revenue |

of $100-$120 a man that most fra-
ternities earn from their pledge
classes in the first semester. The fi-

nancial objection is still there: why
do the fraternities have to pay for
the social life of the freshmen?

The plan ignores the problem of
freshmen going down the road. What
freshman going to refuse an in-
vitation from a fraternity to go down
the road? What fraternity is not going
to make sure that the rusheees it
likes do not have the opportunity to
go down the road on several nights
each week?

In summation, the only major dif-
ference between this plan and the
plan submitted by the deferred rush
committee is allowing freshmen four
party weekends on the fraternity’s
expense and allowing freshmen to go

Is

down the road with the fraternity
members. Fraternities will be forced
to be “rush conscious” during their
parties

The primray to determine the!
candidates for freshman class officers |
was held yesterday. A total of 246)
votes were cast, indicating that ap-|
proximately 67 percent of the fresh-|
man class participated in the pri-|
mary.

The combinaion of Smith-Hum-

Tompkins proposes
constitutional change
for student approval

Joe Tompkins, sophomore repre-
sentative, has introduced an amend-
ment to the Student Body Consti-

tution to provide for the much need-
ed reform in electoral processes.

There will be a meeting Wednes-
day at 8 p.m. in duPont Hall to ex-
plain and discuss the amendments.
The voting on the amendment will
be Thursday. The text of the amend-
ment follows:

The last sentence of the fiirst para-
graph of Article Hl, Section B, Part
1 of the student body constitution
will be deleted and in its place will
be the following:

Said petition must be presented by

the third Monday in April, to be

fixed and publicized by the Exe-
cutive Committee as provided for

in Article Hl, Section C, Part 6.

The following sentence will be added
to Article Il, Section B, Part 3:
If a run-off election has to be held,
the person receiving the plurality
of the votes cast in the run-off will
be declared elected.
The following paragraph will be add-
ed to the student body constitution
as Part 9 of Article IV, Section C:
The number of positions to be
voted upon will determine the num-
ber of persons’ names placed on the
ballot for the general election. If
there are two positions to be filled
there should be no more than four
names placed on the ballot for
said positions. If there is one posi
tion to be filled, there should be
no more than two names placed
on the ballot for that position. If
more than four persons, or more
than two persons, depending on
the number of positions to be filled,
request that their names be placed
on the ballot through petitions,
there will be a primary election
held on the Thursday prior to the
Monday of the general election. If
the number of candidates is to be
reduced to four, voters will be given
and the four
receiving the most votes in the pri
mary election will be placed on the
ballot for the general election the
Monday. If the number

The Executive Committee of the
faculty yesterday rejected the IFC’s
formal motion to create a joint fac-
ulty-student committee to study rush.
Instead it said that it would be will-
ing to consult with a committee ap-
pointed by IFC president, Clark
Carter, to give the IFC further guid-
ance in forming a deferred rush plan.

The IFC then tentatively approved
the Hosford-Stovall plan (See Page
Two) for deferred rush, this plan
allows freshmen four party weekends
at the fraternities in the first semester.
The motion to approve the basic
structure of the Hosford-Stovall plan
was passed with only two dissenting
votes moments after the plan sub-
mitted by the deferred rush commit-
tee had been resoundingly crushed.

The probable members of the stu-
dent committee that will consult with
the executive committee of the fac-
ulty are Mike Hosford, Dave Stovall
(co-authors of the newly adopted
plan), Chuck Kahn (junior justice and
member of the deferred rush com-
mittee), Danny Leonard (one of the
major backers of last week's IFC
resolution), Herb Crenshaw, and John
Carrere.

The meeting between the faculty
and the student group will attempt to
determine an exact interpretation of
what the faculty actually meant in
its resolution and to assure the sup-
port of the faculty executive com-
mittee for the plan before it is sub-
mitted to the faculty as a whole.

Carter also hoped that if the fac-
ulty Executive Committee and the
students could agree that a mid-
semester rush would be equally ad-
vantageous to the University; and
that the faculty committee would en-

dorse The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Plan as outlined in last week's edi-
torial page by Larry Honig along

with a plan that would postpone rush
for a full semester. The IFC vote on
the Hosford-Stovall plan was to give
the members of the committee deal-
ing with the faculty a basic indication
of the general will of the IFC as to
no, limited. or open contact.

Ihe IFC now plans to submit to
the faculty some variation of the Hos-
ford-Stovall plan (one semester pledg-
ing) with a strong endorsement for
The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi plan
(mid-semester pledging). The IFC
hopes to obtain the support of the
faculty Executive Committee’ with
| this strategy.

In other action Dean Atwood warn-
ed that fraternity feuding had broken

 

 

 

Limited contact plan
passed by IFC vote

out again and that if it did not stop

immediately there would be strong
action taken by the SAC and the

IFC judicial board. Clark Carter add-
ed that this was definitely not the
time for the fraternities to become
involved in petty feuds, Dean At-
wood also noted that there were 5
violations of the 3 a.m. rule for
girls leaving the fraternity houses last
weekend. He felt that the University
proctor was doing his best to keep
the houses within the rules but with-
out enforcing the penalties. Dean
Atwood said if fraternities continued
to ignore Mr. Murray's request that
girls be out of the houses by 3 a.m.
the judicial board and the SAC
would have to take action.

A motion was introduced to peti-
tion the SAC and the faculty to
repeal the regulation forbidding girls
above the ground floor of the fra-
ternity houses. It was said that if this
regulation could be repealed that the
balance between upper classmen and
sophomores would be corrected. Dean
Atwood replied that this motion had
a fair chance of passing if the fra-
ternties would guarantee that signifi-
cantly more upperclassmen would
live in. This motion was tabled until
after the deferred rush debate had
been settled.

In final action, Chuck Kahn moved
the IFC sponsor a shoe race during
the half-time on next week's football
game. Two pledges from each fra-
ternity will be at one end of the field
while all their shoes will be at the
other end in a pile. The first team to
put on their shoes and run back to
the other end wins. This motion was
passed.

Honor violations
at Openings

The EC recently passed a reso-
lution which makes it an honor
violation for a student to pledge
that he has purchased a Dance Plan
when he has not. In the past
many students were able to get into
the concerts merely by claiming
that they had purchased a Dance
Pian and had forgotten to bring it
with them, It will also be an honor
offense to 1) purchase a guest ticket
for use by a WA&L student, 2) use
a guest ticket if you are a student;
3) use someone else's card to ob-
tain admission to any concert; and
4) allow your card te be used by
anyone other than yourself.

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi

Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper
Tuesday, October 22, 1968

 

Some necessary concessions,
or, how student government
can become more than a phrase

Democracy is based upon the conviction
that there are extraodinary possibilities
in ordinary people.

—Harry Emerson Fosdick

Speaking on behalf of the Executive Committee at fresh-
man camp this September, Steve Sandler said “There is no
student government at Washington and Lee.” His point was
that 12 students—albeit capable students—have charge of pro-
tecting the interests of 1,458 men. And he wasn’t far from
the truth.

The interested reader would now call attention to those
less direct forms of student government: various committees
appointed by the EC (i.e., Student Control, Assimilation, Cur-
riculum, Library, and Cold Check), the two Ring-tum Phis,
the Inter-Fraternity Council, and the Student Affairs Com-
mittee (student and faculty membership); and in so doing
would hope to show that Washington and Lee men do have
a participating role in their own affairs.

But do they, really? A few examples:

‘@5 The student Curriculum Committee, under the superb
and brilliant leadership of chairman Swede Henberg, is not
allowed to participate in meetings of the faculty Curriculum
Committee. Let’s suppose Mr. Henberg has an idea—any idea
—backed by his group. How may he present it to the faculty
for consideration? He may:

1) ask the EC to endorse it, which endorsement is mean-
ingless unless an interested faculty member decides to introduce
it to his peers, or unless the EC creates a big to-do and is
allowed to make a special in-person appeal; or,

2) appear before the faculty Curriculum Committee and
present the case, which presentation obviously will not be as
complete or as convincing were the faculty members them-
selves allowed to trace its development; or,

3) write about it in one of The Ring-tum Phis; or,

4) forget it.

@5 The student body’s choice of a plan for a five-day week
will be presented to the faculty only after a unanimous endorse-
ment by the EC, intervention by a sympathetic Dean of Stu-
dents, and an editorial which cost this editor a few friends.
‘@5 The IFC has no direct communication with the faculty.
What the IFC is thinking and what it wants are discovered by
the faculty via one of The Ring-tum Phis, Dean Atwood, or
president Clark Carter who has an ex officio position on the
Student Affairs Committee.

‘@5 The student body usually finds out what the faculty is
thinking after the thinking is finished and the decisions made.
Faculty meetings are closed and the minutes are secret.

‘@5 The editors of the student newspapers are given no
official sounding board for what are often ideas in the best
interest of the University at large.

We read last week with jealousy an article in The New
York Times which discussed a survey of 4,014 university ad-
ministrators, faculty members, students, and trustees, conduct-
ed by the American Council on Education. Excerpts:

[there is} overwhelming agreement that students will and should
‘serve as voting members on most important academic committees
_.. two out of three administrators—and a slightly higher propor-
tion of faculty—believe this development is desirable or essential.’

We would venture that few students want to control all
the administrative and legislative processes of Washington and
Lee. What we as students would like, though, is the opportunity
to be listened to and to listen, because we feel competent to
participate, and we feel the University disallows our participa-
tion at the peril of student/ W&L relations.

We suggest the following, and sincerely believe that each
is obtainable and necessary:

—limited student voting membership on the faculty Cur-
riculum Committee, the Committee on Courses and Degrees,
and any committee in the future which has to do with affairs
of interest to a majority of students;

—amalgamation of the faculty Library Committee with the
Student Library Committee;

consolidation of the Student Control Commitee with the
Student Affairs Committee, with students in a majority;

——a regular report in person to the faculty by the Executive
Commitee; and,

—the privilege of attendance at faculty meetings granted
to the president of the IFC, the president, vice president, and
secretary of the student body, and the editors of The Ring-
tum Phis.

Thursday's vote

Thursday the student body will be given an opportunity to
vote yea or nay on a proposed amendment to the constitution,
which amendment will, if passed, provide for selection of office
holders by plurality vote in runoff elections.

Such a provision seemed unnecessary until last year, when
write-in votes for president of the student body denied a ma-
jority to the front-runner. The situation was settled, but not
without some debate.

730 affirmative votes will be necessary to affect this needed
change—we join the Executive Committee in urging everyone
in the University to drop by a ballot box Thursday and vote in
favor of the amendment.

Why is apartment living far more
desirable than the dorms or the fra-
ternity houses? The question is not
posed in innocence; the answer is
patently obvious—the University’s re-
strictions on the fraternity houses and
the dormitories make apartments
much more attractive. In apartments
the student has the freedom to do
what he choses; he can decorate it as
he choses; he can make whatever
noise he wants when he wants to
(within civilized restrictions) and
most important, he may entertain
females in his apartment.

Dormitories are the least desirable
of the living quarters. No liquor or
beer is allowed; the student is limited
in the type of decorations he can use;
he has no choice over those he has
to live with. There are no other
facilities besides the shower room
down the hall and the small cubicle
called a room. It is very obvious
why a majority of the W&L students
opt for non-dormitory housing at the
first opportunity.

Fraternity houses solve most of the
problems and horrors of the dormi-
tory housing. Girls are not, however,
allowed above the ground floor of
the fraternity houses. Therefore, as
soon as a fraternity member has ful-
filled his obligation to the house to

University urged to relax
regulations on fraternities

live in for a year or two, he im-
mediately moves to an apartment
where he can live completely free of
any hindering regulations. This com-
plete freedom is the main attraction
of the apartments.

The fraternity houses are increas-
ingly becoming less and less the cen-
ter of the students’ life and increas-
ingly a place to eat and hear a combo
play on weekends. Very often, in fact,
fraternity houses become deserted
during the last hour of a combo
party as students and their dates
head out toward the best ‘party apart-
ments.’

Article 7 of a report entitled “Sub-
committee Report to the Student
Affairs Committee” which deals with
fraternity self-improvement and was
published last year states: “Each chap-
ter should seek to balance house resi-
dents between seniors and sopho-
mores, adding juniors as needed to
establish an upperclass majority, by
providing incentives for those seniors
and juniors best qualified to help in
the development of underclassmen to
live in the chapter house and be re-
sponsible for the individual develop-
mental programs of the underclass-
men, with particular emphasis on atti-
tudes and conduct.”

How can the University expect
upperclassmen to give up the potent-

McGuire answers Yevich
about Saturday classes

Robert Yevich, Editorial-Page Editor:

As the Tuesday Edition has for
some time now publicized and sup-
ported the Lynchburg plan of class
blocking I think both you and your
readers are due some explanation as
to why this plan is not recommended
to the faculty by the Five-Day-Week
Committee.

If 50 minutes (about the minimum)
are allowed for lunch on the Lynch-
burg plan, the class day does not
end at 1:20 p.m. as suggested by you
but at 5:00 p.m. You seem remark-
ably well insulated to the fact that
close to half of our students and a
considerable portion of our faculty
members are involved in afternoon
class or lab work at the present time.

Late afternoon classes now let out
at 4:40 p.m. This is a disadvantage
to students who wish both to take
work offered in the afternoon and to
participate in extracurricular activi-
ties—most notably athletics. A 5:00
p.m. closing time would compound
this difficulty. All of the plans seri-
ously considered by the committee
close the class day at about 4:00 p.m.
and disallow the regular scheduling
of extracurricular activities prior to
that time.

A variety of other criticism was
brought against the Lynchburg plan,
none of which seemed too important
to me, In any case the one outlined

 

(Editor's note: the following is a proposal for deferred
rush introduced at last night's IFC meeting by Dave
Stovall and Mike Hosford, It is different from the
proposals of the Deferred Rush Committee, but it
is within the framework of the faculty resolution of
May, 1967.)

a 3 *

By DAVE STOVALL
IFC Member

and MIKE HOSFORD
IFC Member

This proposal grew out of disenchantment with the
no-contact plan presented by the IFC Deferred Rush
Committee and from the lack of any other plan which
satisfied the faculty’s provisions. We feel that we have
a plan that will cause a minimum amount of trouble
in its institution for a number of reasons.

First, it is equitable. Every house has an equal
chance to meet and woo the freshmen. This is the rea-
son bus service to and from the girls’ schools has to
be provided, and also in-town bussing on party week-
ends, to help those houses who are further out than
others.

Second, it is reasonably enforceable, where the no-
contact plan was not. We feel that with limited contact
on the campus, on party weekends, and at other specified
times, control will be less a problem than with the no-
contact plan. You will always have some problem in a
community so small in size and number.

Third, it requires a strong student to be pledged
into a fraternity. Obviously, academic orientation is the
faculty’s main concern in regard to fraternity rush. With
pledging not until second semester after a relaxed first
semester, there hopefully will be greater academic effort
on the part of the freshman. With a 2.0 required to
pledge, a freshman has to work hard. We hope this
meets with the faculty's approval.

Fourth, there is no undue strain on either the fresh-
men or the fraternities. Open houses and smokers are
set up on Friday nights, and the other contact is on party
weekends. This causes no strain either academically,
socially, or financially, (We are also bucking for abolition
of Saturday classes!)

Fifth, it has a flexible but permanent calendar. This
allows long range advance p'anning for both the fraterni-
ties and the administration.

We feel this plan is the closest one possible in re-
gard to the benefits to the fraternities, the freshmen,
and the University as a whole. It alleviates the problem

Another rush proposal

of large scale university sponsored entertainment for
freshmen. It provides the academic orientation needed
for the freshmen. It offers the best program with the
fewest problems. We just hope you like it. It is the
only alternative.

@ There will be a rush registration fee of twenty-three
dollars ($23.00), $5.00 of which goes to the IFC, $18.00
of which is divided equally among the fraternities, to
be paid by each student going through rush before the
first day of classes.

@ The first three Fridays after the start of classes shall
consist of open houses. Each open house shall be of one
hour duration, including transportation to and from the
fraternity houses. No more than thirty rushees may be
present at any one house.

@ No rushee may visit a single fraternity more than
once during the first three weeks of rush (no more than
one open house may be attended.) A rushee is required
to see a minimum of twelve (12) houses during the three
Friday nights of open houses.

@ There will be no fraternity or individually sponsored
parties for the purpose of rush during the summer,
Thanksgiving vacation, or Christmas vacation.

@ There will be no communication with new men after
their arrival in Lexington, in any manner, until the start
of classes for the fall semester, after which contact is
limited to areas on the campus other than the dormi-
tories, and to fraternity houses at the specified times.
No rushee shall be allowed in fraternity houses at other
than the specified times, nor in the lodging of any
upperclassmen (other than fraternity houses) for the
duration of rush through the first week of the second
semester.

@ All rushing will end at 11:00 p.m. on the first
Wednesday after the start of the second semester. No
upperclassman or active or alumni member of any chap-
ter may enter the dorms from 11:00 p.m. Wednesday
until 5:00 p.m, on Friday.

@ Fraternity members shall not be allowed to enter the
dorms at any time during the first semester, except
dormitory counselors or members of the IFC Rush Com-
mittee. During the first three class days of the second
semester, fraternity men may enter the dorms between
the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. only for the
purpose of issuing bids to the rushees. During this time,
a maximum of six (6) members from each fraternity
shall be allowed to enter the dorms with the time
allowed not to exceed twenty (20) minutes, No official
bids ws be extended to any rushee except during this
period.

Concert Series schedules three recitals

including Ali Akbar Khan, sarod master

By MACK WOODWARD
Assistant News Editor

During its twenty-third season the
Rockbridge Concert-Theatre Series
will offer music of the highest artistic
merit. Among the musical attractions
for this year are the New York Pro
Musica, Ali Akbar Khan, and the

\tonal art of India to Lexington, Mr.
Khan is ranked among the great
musicians of the world and is fe-
garded as India’s master musician,
The sarod, ancestor of all India’s
stringed instruments, has twenty-five
strings mounted from a gourd-shaped
sounding box. Ten of the strings are
plucked with a coconut shell pick; the

 

Washington National Symphony. The) other fifteer are for sympathetic re-
fall membership drive of the series! sonance. The sarod is accompanied

Thursday, October 31, the date of| and one wooden. The tabla punctuate

the opening concert,

The New York Pro Musica, the
widely acclaimed ensemble of six
vocalists and four instrumentalists,
will perform in Lexington for the first
time on October 31. Under the direc-
tion of John White, the Pro Musica
features a richly-colored repertoire of
medieval and Renaissance music, with
special emphasis on the music of the
Spanish Court and Theatre,

On Tuesday, February 18, Ali
Akbar Khan, the master sarod player,

 

accompanied by Mahapurush Misra
on the tabla, will introduce the ancient

and enhance the delicate sounds of
the sarod, providing a counter theme
at times and elaborating on the raga

| ws the music builds.

| The 1968-69 Series will conclude
with a concert by the Washington
National Symphony Orchestra on
Thursday, April 24. “The Orchestra
of the Presidents.” as it is often call-
ed, is under the direction of Howard
Mitchell. For many years, the ninety-
six piece orchestra has made a major
contribution to Lexington’s cultural
life, and so their return next spring

 

will provide a fitting climax to this

series. The National Symphony has
been in Lexington for each concert
series.

During its drive for membership,
the Rockbridge Concert-Theatre Series
is offering a reduced membership to
college students, Memberships for the
Series may be purchased at the Book

Smith blasts EC’s failure
to meet responsibility

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

Once again the EC has shown that
it has nothing new to say on the
question of race relations at Wash-
ington and Lee and the Lexington
community. Last spring, at that time
the only black student on this campus,
I raised certain questions with the
EC concerning its responsibility for
leadership in meeting the problems
that would accompany the changing
complexion of the W&L student body.
Last Tuesday the new EC made its
attitude known,

Steve Sandler, a member of that
body, proposed that the EC adopt
a statement similar to that of the
IFC concerning housing discrimina-
tion against Negro girls from  sur-
rounding schools. His resolution
would ask all girls to patronize only
those houses in Lexington which
would be willing to take girls on a
nondiscriminatory basis. In addition,
the EC was asked to help the IFC
compile and make available a list of
those houses. This the EC refused to
do. Like its predecessor before it,
the EC sought refuge in the self-
serving declaration that no problem
exists and that even if it does, why

Powell criticizes faculty
for ignoring students

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

After having read the Oct. 15 issue
of The Ring-tum Phi, I have been
prodded to write an open letter to the
faculty concerning some rather blatant
inconsistencies in their recent be-
havior. Lately the student body has
been confronted with that lack of
understanding and almost absolute re-
jection of student proposals which no
doubt led to problems in other uni-
versities such as Columbia. This is
not to say | advocate the measures
employed there at all, I don't, it
just seems the faculty is determined
to irritate the student body.

In his article, Dr. Schwab makes
this rather absolute statement: “...
Washington and Lee will have de-
ferred rush next fall...” There is
no room for discussion left open,

Barr notes merits
of deferred rush

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

May I begin this letter by saying
that I am basically in favor of de-
ferred rush.

As the faculty asserts, it will pre-
sumably give the freshman a better
look at the various fraternities, and
vice-versa. Consequently, in theory if
not in fact, the fraternities would
experience fewer pledges who decide
that they are in the wrong house and
=* result ey This, 1 believe,
S the crux of the faculty's argument.

Under the current proposal _ con-
tact would exist between the fresh-
men and upper classes, And, as a
result, there would be less distraction
in order that the freshman might be-
come more academically oriented. The
idea that the freshman start on his
studies rather than pledging is rather
enhancing. but how many freshmen
are going to study until November?

Would there not be other distrac
tions, Le. Doe's, the new Union, of
any other drinking establishment, with

Soccer game with Roanoke
postponed because of storm
causes scheduling problems

Washington and Lee’s soccer squad
| lost its chance on Saturday to add
an important win to its record. The
Generals were slated to go against
Roanoke College, one of the toughest
teams on their schedule, in Roanoke.
The game was called early Saturday
morning on account of rain.

Coach Lyles of W&L was extremely
unhappy with the decision. “This is
the first time I’ve ever heard of can-
celling a soccer game for rain. At
least they could have given us a little
more notice.” As a result, the Blue
will probably not be able to re-
schedule the Roanoke game. The
| booters have several games left, and
|another game added to their plans
would be very tiring.

The Generals next game will be
Friday afternoon against Virginia
Tech, here at W&L. By that time, all
ailing players should be recovered
enough to play, including Scott
Fechnay who should be back in con-

Washington and Lee’s much-herald-
ed defense finally came through in
Saturday's Homecoming match-up
with Hampden-Sydney, but so did
the Tigers’. In a rather dreary mud
bath, the Generals were only able to
salvage a scoreless tie. There wasn't
a single serious scoring threat by
either side in the entire game.

The rains came Friday morning
and lasted until just before gametime.
As the mist finally stopped, a steady
stream of old grads, mingled with a
few die-hard students, slowly began
to fill a few stadium seats. Total at-
tendance was around 2500, not over-
whelming for a Homecoming game.

When the kickoff finally came,
about an hour late, nobody was
able to do much of anything. Foot-
holds were impossible, the turf was
chewed to pieces, and an air attack
was next to impossible.

It seemed in the opening minutes
as if the Generals were in for a

the kick on their thirty, and moved
the ball to the W&L 49 before they
were forced to punt. The Blue got
a break, though, in a bad pass to

A sports editorial

Promises are made to be broken

The Physical Education department has once again placed
itself in the position of spoiler. After receiving permission
Thursday to use the upper practice field and the limer for a
rugby game on Saturday with Richmond, Rugby Club presi-
dent and freshman soccer coach Tim Henry was told shortly
before game time that the field could not be used. The Rich-
mond team had arrived and was forced to return without
having played.

The reasons for refusing use of the field are unimportant.
Washington and Lee’s Rugby Club had been given the word
of the department; what’s more, permission was rescinded too
late to change any plans. The recalcitrant attitude of Mr.
Twombly is typified in his words to the club, ‘I don’t give a
damn if they came from Toronto.”

rushed, and the Generals took over
on their own 42. This was a situation
that was repeated many times to both |
sides. |

The Blue made no yardage what- |
soever. Their punt carried to the |
Hampden-Sydney 25, and the Tigers |
were on the march once again. A key |
run by halfback Jim Whorley took |
the visitors to the W&L 40, before the |
defensive unit began to dig in. A
blitz, alert linebacking, and offsides
and illegal motion penalties, all com-|
bined to put H-S in a fourth and |
seventeen situation. |

The Generals came back on the |
field in the second half determined |
to get some points. They failed to
move on their first series from scrim- |
mage, but the defense kept Hampden- |
| Sydney bottled up deep in their own |
territory. The Tigers punted and W&L |
had the ball on the H-S 45. Joe
Dozier gave the Blue a first down on |
the 34 with runs of six and five
yards, Another run and a short pass
to Bucky Cunningham by Chuck
Kuhn gave the Generals a fourth and
three on the 21. Lacking a field-goal
specialist, the decision was to go for
the first down. Joe Dozier took the
hand-off and drove into the line. The
chains were brought out and the
measurement was debated over by
the players and referees. The Blue
were just shy, and Hampden-Sydney
took possession.

Once again the game stalemated.
As the quarter was drawing to a
close, the Tigers had finally put some
yardage between themselves and their
own goal. With the ball on his 40,
Beale fumbled the slippery ball, and
Dean Kumpuris recovered for the
Generals on the H-S 38. With three
straight carries, Dozier made it to the
26 for a first down. Once again the
Blue had a chance to score. Quarter-
back Kuhn overthrew Cunningham
around the ten, but bucked the line
on the next play to make it to the
23. With third and seven WAL en-
countered the same ball-handling dif-
ficulties which had given them the
ball. Split end Rick McMillan couldn't
hang on to a soggy pass, and the
home team was in a fourth down
situation once again. Jack Baizley |
came in at quarterback, but the pass!
from center slipped away in the mud, |

convenience due to archaic local so-
cial customs. Yet, only one member
of that august body which purports
to speak for the students of this uni-
versity recognized the EC’s responsi-
bility to do what could be done to
avoid further situations of this kind.
Sandler is to be commended for his
farsighted and responsible position,
in view of the callous and irrespon-
sible attitude of the other members.
He appears to be unaffected by the
chloroform of conformity which grips
the EC,

What bizarre reasoning was put
forward as a basis for the EC vote
against Sandler's resolution, Hend-
ricks is quoted as saying that
impetus should come from W&L in
this matter,” Leonard takes the posi-
tion that it would do nothing “but
disturb a lot of women,” while
Simmons refuses to acknowledge that
a problem exists. I have heard that
last argument too many times, It is
beginning to sound like a broken
record. In my opinion, the reasons
advanced only thinly veil the EC's
eagerness to sweep this matter under
the rug. Thus a weak-kneed EC with
no stomach for taking a moral stand
choose the easier road of acquiescing
in racial bigotry.

By bowing to the prejudices of
local matrons, the EC has placed its
stamp of approval upon their actions.
The Friday Editor rightly states that

People—Martin

“by rejecting this motion, the EC
which is the voice of the student
body, has approved of the situation as
it now exists. In effect, the EC’s de-
cision states that W&L favors dis-
crimination and is not in favor of
changing housing policies.”

We do not exist here in an isolated
vacuum, Others outside our com-
munity are interested in our actions.
Earlier this year, President Huntley
pledged that Washington and Lee
would meet the challenges before it.
Presently our university is striving to
attract and keep students of racial
minority background who are cap-
able of benefitting from and con-
tributing to the educational experi-
ence at Washington and Lee.

The EC should reverse its posi-
tion and thus make it possible to
advance this goal. Certainly, these
students would have cause for hesita-
tion about attending here if it appears
that the student establishment with its
power to mold student opinion would
not be willing to protect the interests
of the entire student body.

The EC should reverese its posi-
tion with all deliberate speed. In
doing so, it would be serving the best
interests of this university. Washing-
ton and Lee need not stand mute
when local attitudes threaten its self-
interest. We are moving into the last
quarter of the twentieth century,
either we take our stand now and
tell it like it is, or simply let the
world know that we are unwilling to
face the truth. Both the town of
Lexington and the EC seem to be un-
aware that the times, they are a’-
changing.

only that the event will occur, What |

you don't see mentioned, however, is
that Saturday classes will not exist
next fall. Why? I suggest that there
are some rather academic reasons for

 

Such ideas as the students would
have too much time on weekends to
play and that they might be tempted
to travel to far away places, or, that
some teachers, who have tenure, or
are afraid their daily routine might be
broken up, or, that the traditional
W&L that they knew forty years ago
will be lost. I submit these are not
valid excuses for maintaining an anti-
quated system of class blocking.

If the faculty passed the no Satur-
day classes rule, there would be more
time available for research by the
professors, but of course this might
mean they would have to publish and
this means extra work and therefore
is out of the question. Also by not
having Saturday classes, the weekday
classes would be longer, allowing for
a better discussion in class.

It also seems ludicrous to me
for the faculty to say it is not feasible
for W&L to change over when a
school almost eight times our size
did it without problem. What is so
difficult about having MWF classes
as usual and TTS classes meet for
longer periods on TT; we are in-
telligent people capable of adjusting,

The point I wish to convey is this:
the faculty has created a situation of
double standard and it doesn’t seem
appropriate that they should set them-
selves up as being perfect or even
totally open-minded, because they are
not. What I propose is that the faculty
realize that they too must change

and that W&L is behind other compet-

ing universities in many areas, and
these areas are perhaps more im-
portant to the total scope of the Uni-
versity than the idea of forcing fra-
ternities to accept deferred rush.

system.

I began this article saying that I
was in favor of deferred rush. In
spite of the above arguments, I still
am. Let rush start the second week-
end after classes begin. At U.Va.
deferred rush works successfully, and
successfully is the only way any sys-
tem can work,

Let rush begin the first weekend in
October, and let the fraternities choose
their method of rush. To keep up,
however, a combo would be necessary
on Saturday nights or no one would
come. Let rush last for six, or perhaps
eight, weeks with contact. This way
the freshman would have a way to

ever hope to reestablish the domi-
nance of upperclassmen in the fra-
ternity houses is by revoking all Uni-
versity regulations over the fraternity
houses and putting this power in the
hands of the IFC or the individual
fraternity houses.

There was a motion in the IFC last
night requesting that the Student
Affairs Committee or whichever body
in the University hierarchy has juris-
diction to reconsider this regulation.
Allowing girls in the upper floors of
the fraternity houses would definitely
stem the flow of upperclassmen out
of the houses. Allowing girls in the
dormitories would bring W&L out of

expend his energies other than over the Victorian age and into the con-

a book.

Probably the greatest criticism of
any deferred system of rush is the
cost, which would be even greater
than it is now. Most fraternities, since
they are not as large, generally, as
those at U.Va., could not effectively
make a go of deferred rush. In that
case, fraternities shall have to put
on an intense summer rush.

The faculty system as proposed is
absolutely ridiculous, both from our
and ostensibly the freshman’s point of
view. If, however, it is passed, we will
obviously have to live with it or die.
The faculty seems hell-bent on de-
