“The way
I see it’

By SWEDE HENBERG

Curriculum Committee Chairman

During the first part of this
semester, the Faculty Curriculum
Committee will present its recom-

mendations for curricular changes to
the faculty as a whole. Although the
details are not yet completely work-
ed out, the general outline of the
plan entails a revision of the uni-
versity calendar. Switching from the
present two semester system, the com-
mittee’s plan calls for three periods
of study, two of twelve weeks, and
one of six weeks. An outline of
this proposal appeared some time ago
in an interview with Dr. Roberts in
the Tuesday Ring-tum Phi.

It is not my intention to give
either a summary or an evaluation
of the Faculty Committee's proposal.
After the proposal has gone to the
faculty, the Student Curriculum Com-
mittee will present its own report to
the Executive Committee so that it
can consider a recommendation of its
own. The entire situation is com-
plex, and I hesitate to give any
abbreviated criticism of the Faculty
Committee’s proposal for two rea-
sons, First of all I don’t want to
give the impression that the proposal
now taking shape will pass in its
entirety.

Undoubtedly there will be emenda-
tions and deletions right up to the
time a certain aspect of the proposal
is voted. I am afraid that giving a
summary of the proposal might lead
seme people to the conclusion that
all decisions have been made and
that all we need wait for is the
faculty's vote on the composite pro-
posal. The actual situation is that
the plan is still tentative, it’s recom-
mendations fluid. The plan will not
receive a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ vote for its
entirety; it will rather be broken down
and voted on in sections in order to
promote the more acceptable aspects.

In addition to avoiding the im-
pression that evertyhing is final and
will definitely pass, | hesitate to
summarize because of the complexity
of the whole plan. Unless it were
possible to devote an entire issue of
the Ring-tum Phi to the subject of
the curriculum, there would be many
aspects of the plan that would not
receive attention, Just the mere fact
of revising the University Calendar

After Sam Hinkle’s report, the IFC
spent the remainder of its session dis-
cussing the SAC and the faculty in
relation to several needed reforms
it has proposed. Clark Carter re-
ported that the faculty had requested
the SAC to investigate the living
conditions in the dormitories and
therefore, consideration of the IFC's
request to modify the pareital rules
relating to girls above the first floor
had to be postponed.

IFC treasurer, Mark Eaker then
moved that fraternities be allowed to
have combo parties on Friday even-
ing. The present regulations, passed
during the era of the 6-day week,
do not allow Friday night combos
except on one of the big weekends.
It was stated that for the IFC to
change any of its social regulations,
a petition had to be first sent to the
SAC where it would ultimately be
sent on to the faculty with or with-

out a recommendation, The IFC then |

unanimously passed Eaker’s motion

In one of its shorter meetings of
the year, the Executive Committee
last night voted unanimously to
recommend to the faculty EC that
a reading day be provided in May
between the last day of classes and
the first day of exams. In other
action, Dean Kumpuris and Joe
Tompkins were directed to continue
their study of the Co-op as a pos-
sible locus of student employment;
direction was provided for action in
future weeks on Mock Convention
debts, the OAS, and constitutional
revision. No one was absent from the
meeting.

The recommendation concerning a
reading day came after a motion by
Steve Sandler, the student EC repre-
sentative to the faculty EC. Sandler
said that at the last faculty EC meet-
ing he attended, no satisfactory re-
sponse was tendered to his query
about the reason for the present back-
to-back scheduling of classes and
exams next May. Briefly considered
and tentatively dropped for logistical
reasons was a suggestion that a stu-
dent petition be gathered requesting

 

ever, may reconsider this proposal if
its recommendation brings no results
in the faculty EC.

Dean Kumpuris and Joe Tomp-
kins, who have been studying the
feasibility of student employment in
the Co-op, reported that there were
several problems involved—the main
ones were the relation of the Co-op
to the University and the adverse re-
action such suggestions may have up-
on those who are presently employed
there. Jay Passavant made it clear,

Poet Richard Wilbur will

Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Rich-
ard Wilbur will lecture and read from
his works in duPont Auditorium
Wednesday and Thursday nights next

In 1987, Richard Wilbur won both
the Pultizer Prize and the National
Book Award for his “Things of the
World.” He will read from his works
on Wednesday night and will lecture
on “Poetry and Happiness” Thursday
night.

A professor of English at Wesleyan
University, Mr. Wilbur is the author
of three other books of poems, “The
Beautiful Changes” in 1947, “Cere-
mony and Other Poems” in 1950, and
“Advice to a Prophet” in 1961.

He has also translated a number
of French poets, and his 1955 verse

abolishment of finals in June and the
establishment of a weekend in March,
the sales of Dance Plans throughout
the year and of individual tickets to
WAL students before each concert,
the non-transferability of Dance Plans,
the elimination of monetary renum-
eration to anyone on the Dance
Board, and the issuance of free Dance
Plans only to Board officers and
weekend presidents (but to the latter

only for the specific weekend in-
volved).

Virginia survived an attack of fly-

THE RING-TUM PHI

 

Editorial responsibility

Jay Passavant announced last month a decision made by |
the EC in executive session on January 6, that comments |
from the floor would no longer be entertained during regular |
meetings. This ruling has precedent in governmental legisla-
tive procedure and is designed to prevent Executive Com-
mittee sessions from becoming disjointed and protracted |
debates.

Such a measure will effectively reduce immediate exchanges
between EC members and other students, except when specific
proposals are introduced (which obviously cannot be done at
each meeting). And so public-affairs-minded students may well
question their ability to be heard by their governors, quite a
legitimate worry.

Providing an answer to that question is one of the justi-
fications for the existance of The Ring-tum Phi. Ideally, here
the interplay will take its most potent, permanent form: in
print. Unfortunately, few have taken advantage of this news-
paper as a vehicle of opinion—an example is the failure of
students to take advantage of “The way I see it.” Another
example is the apparent unwillingness of many brilliant and
diversely interested students to put forth their ideas—on any-
thing—in the paper.

In an effort to promote student interest in campus affairs
and to further establish The Ring-tum Phi as a genuine forum,
we have granted two columnist positions, one to Jack Horowitz
and one to Larry Hilliard. Their perquisites will be the con-,
cession to write anything they choose, no restrictions, pro-
vided 1) they write an article every Tuesday and 2) they
turn it in on time. The only other attachment to these liberal
conditions is that the editor may remove a columnist after four
issues.

Hopefully Messrs. Horowitz and Hilliard will not, as we
will not, be everyone’s friend. Perhaps their candor and well
placed barbs will elicit response and some needed thought or
even action.

We choose not, incidentally, to demean our two columnists
with The Ring-tum Phi’s standard apology “. . . not necessarily
represent...” There is one place where the editorial opinion
of this edition may be found: in the editorials. After that we
are the students’ newsaper. That’s our job. Make us earn
our pay.

The Dance Board {II}

The Executive Committee’s action on Dance Board affairs
last week was well planned, well considered, and necessary.
And Jay Passavant has indicated the Board will be subject to
continued scrutiny. The measures taken to date, however, fall

“somewhat short of what is needed.

We will not join those who scorn every move of the
Dance Board—some of its leaders, notably president Jim
Livesay, have made imaginative improvements in running the
concerts. But the organization of the Board is a social and
political anachronism,

‘63 Dean Kumpuris knew at the end of his sophomore
year that he would be Dance Board president in his senior
year. We do not know enough of Board affairs to pass judg-
ment on Mr. Kumpuris, but there is a definite error in any
system of this nature which bypasses consideration of applicants
beyond a certain (very early) time and which excludes mem-
bership from all but a select group of fraternities.

‘@5 The president of the Dance Board has almost un-
checked control over the use of funds. Certainly Professor
Phillips, advisor, can (and does) exert considerable influence
on financial matters. Last year’s Board, however, spent $7,-
319.91 more than it earned, solely at the discretion of its
president. We are not presuming to say that Messrs. Livesay
and Kumpuris will do the same—but they have the power to,
which is unfortunate.

‘@5 Escalating costs of performers have devastated the
Board’s ability to provide four enjoyable weekends a year.
Responses have not progressed past the stage of settling for
less exciting (and very often poorer) entertainment. A more
rational solution, one which this newspaper suggested in
October, would be to eliminate one of the weekends.

The Dance Board will have to undergo some considerable
changes to justify its continued existence in the form as we
know it now. Executive Editor Reed Byrum has made an ex-
haustive study of all aspects of the Board and presents his
initial findings in today’s paper. Hopefully those in authority
will view our thoughts as they are intended, constructively,
designed to protect the student body’s interest and investment.

Criticism of Dance Board
is attacked as unjustified

Exam revision; some questions

There are definite merits in doing away with the present
system of administering final examinations. These tests are
such a large part of the final grade that students are justifiably
concerned over the arbitrary assignment of the day on which
each exam must be taken. The Executive Committee’s solution
to this problem, though better than the present system, is not
much of a boon to students and is too much of a burden on
the faculty.

The most formidable criticism is the same as the one
levied against the abolishment of Saturday classes. Are there
any educational benefits? As is now stands, no. The exam pe-
riod would be a full two days shorter, with the addition of a few
days afterwards for grading. This in effect allows a student to
omit, for studying purposes, only three days from the period.
And after exams are over—then what? Every student gets
four free days. Personally, we would rather have these days
during the exam period for studying, even if they were ran-
domly and arbitrarily placed.

Neither does it appear a good idea to fix schedules two
weeks in advance. Why not let a student decide his next
exam whenever he chooses—even the night before—and have
them distributed on this basis. The argument in favor of the
two-week predetermination is that the faculty would be more
likely to accept the proposals since a student could not pro-
crastinate to the point of a crisis situation. This is ridiculous.
If the faculty places no more faith in students than to rely on
such measures, then we don’t deserve an independent schedul-
ing system anyway.

And without intending to demean the thorough job done
by the EC committee which formalized the exam proposal,
the process of procuring an exam seems a bit tedious. There
are far too many slips and pacquets to sign and countersign
at Mary Baldwin; why must we parrot their system? Per-
haps Hollins College provides a better basis, allowing its stu-
dents to receive any examination from a central administration
area at any prescribed time. The girls sign the exams out, take
them, then sign them back in. What else is needed?

It is obvious that there should be some reform. We heartily
stand behind the Executive Committee for formalizing one
of the ideas of last year’s junior representative Herb Crenshaw.
But the commitment to reform carries with it the obligation
to achieve that reform as simply as possible.

Executive Editor

Once again, the quarterly criticism
ot the Dance Board has been res-
surected upon this campus: it always
happens after every big weekend and
has yet to have become a passe
activity.

But the ten men who plan the
dance sets many months in advance
and who sacrifice their time, their
pleasure, and the company of their
dates to complete final preparations
for the concerts receive little thanks
and much ballyhoo. No one has yet
to appreciate the seemingly vain
eflorts of these people, although
about eleven hundred students and
their dates inevitably attend the con-
certs and enjoy, apparently only for
the moment, the fruits of the Dance
Board's labors. The actions should
justifiably overrule the verbal dis-
sension, yet quite paradoxically they
don't: criticism still reigns and goes
uncontested.

Now, the critics have delved far
beneath the surface of the weekends
and are concentrating upon the fi-
nances, the structure, and the admin-
istration of the Board, After the
most comprehensive study, I feel that
this is but the “sound and fury,
signfying nothing,” of the ever dis-
enchanted and dissatisfied. Yet too
many people listen to the critics, while
remaining deaf to the defenders:
this article will attempt to shed light
upon some of the fallacies purported
by the cynics and to salvage the
tarnished reputation of the Board,

Perhaps the most widespread claim
launched against the Board by the
student body is its choice of enter-
tainment, This group employs Stan
Rubin, an entertainer himself, to book
all of the concerts; contrary to popu-
lar belief, he is able to obtain any
individual or group in the business,
from Sammy Davis Jr, and Aretha
Franklin to the Airplane and the
Holding Company. But WAL is great
ly restriced in its choice of per-
formers by a lack of sufficient funds,
and the students will have to under-
stand that they are getting the best
available for the money which they
set forth. Students must also realize
that for a much larger amount of
money they could obtain anyone

whom they wished, but then again,

Leven to hope for

 

In the same vein, students ex-
plode when groups fail to appear for
the concerts and heap their wrath
upon the Dance Board, quite un-
justifiably. However, the Board can't
be blamed for the actions of the
entertainers, as they are the ones who
cause all of the trouble. Performers
usually book two or three other shows
for the same date and wait until
the last minute to choose which one
they shall attend, that is, the one
which will pay the most. WAL has
been most fortunate in having as
many groups as it has to show for
the amount of money it offers. In
fact, last year we had only two
last minute cancellations, this figure
one half of the number which Rubin
had during the entire year. So per-
haps we aren't as unlucky as we are
led to believe; whatever, it is de-
finitely not the fault of the Board

tucky instead of its Virginia counter-
part. Little is usually ever heard of
such things as this, but it is often
when the agent or a member of the
Dance Board goes out of his way to
secure an appearance of a performer.

Iwo big problems exist in con-
tracting performers aside from fi-
nances, The first is the location of
Lexington: it is very much off the
main drag and is extremely incon-
venient for groups to get efficient
transportation to and from the town,
Also, it is not on the paths of most
entertainers when they make tours
through the South, mostly because of
the location of our town, The next
hindrance is that of having four fixed
dates each year. Many times a con-
flict with a certain group is created,
because they may be making a tour
of another region and may not want
to go oul of their way just to appear
in Lexington; it would be both im-
practical and inconvenient for them
to do this.

The finances of the Dance Board
represent another big point of con-
tention of the critics, The lack of
funds is the most outstanding eco-
monic hindrance of the Board, and
many measures are being taken to
solve this dilemma

Last Saturday was a red letter day
in the annals of Washington and
Lee history. For the first time there
were no Saturday classes. WAL took
a giant step into twentieth century
education when the faculty voted for
the five-day week. But several other
changes should also be made at this
dowdy old University.

The curriculum needs to be mod-
ernized and expanded, the University
needs new facilities, especially a new
gymnasium, the University should
fully integrate, and most intriguingly,
the University should take steps to-
ward coeducation.

There is absolutely no reason why
Washington and Lee should not be
a coeducational institution, And the
benefits would be numerous.

By barring almost 40 per cent of
the country’s collegiate community,

 

the University is denying admission
io many students who could make a
significant contribution to all facets

of University life. And how about
all the males who will not even
consider WAL. because the thought of
going to an all men’s college revolts
them?

The myth that females cannot

compete scholastically with males has
been exploded at all coeducational
universities, Extracurricular activities
would also benefit greatly from the

 

contributions of talented young ladies
Wouldn't it be nice to turn on WLUR

 

and hear the pleasing tones of a soft,
feminine voice?

But it is in the realm of social life
that females would make their most
obvious contribution. And who could
possibly say this is bad? Let's face
it, a society without females is an
unnatural society.

The current social structure at

setback of the season at the hands |
of Asheville-Billmore 111-83

Bulldogs were

not be stopped from making 44
points, He had amazing strength and

even while closely guarded. Another
Asheville-Biltmore player, Healey,

showed power on the boards and in
addition the victorious Bulldogs had

quick and agressive guards. A full
court press throughout most of the
sume took its toll on the Generals

Asheville-Bilimore kept such tre
mendous pressure on Washington and
Lee that the Bulldogs stole the ball
frequently, The also had

the first period. From then on Wash-
ington and Lee could not play its
control type of offense, but was forced
to play Asheville-Biltmore’s game—
run and gun,

Despite the 28 point margin, Mike
Neer played his second straight out-
standing game. Mike collected 33
points. Mike was the mainstay of
Washington and Lee's rebounding
}gume once again. Even with Neer’s
exciting play however, the Generals
simply could not contain their op-
ponent’s lightning-quick offense.

But the determining factor was that
Washington and Lee could not play
the kind of game it wanted to play

Saturday night simply wasn't a good
one for WAL's basketball team. Our
Generals seemed to have trouble
getting started, while Asheville-Bilt
more could do nothing wrong. The

wright and Neer snatching most of
the missed attempts.

Coach Canfield’s perfected match-
up defense forced the opposition to
take numerous poor shots. Mean-
while, the Generals drove against the
Green Terrors at will, with Neer
working at either high or low post.
Midway through the period W&L
started to shell WMC from outside,
which caused the lead to jump to
double figures.

After a brief break for half Wash-
ington and Lee stormed back out to
combine hot shooting with rebounding
strength. WMC’s rebounding increas-
ed considerably in the final period,
but so did the rebounding done by
the Generals, who held the Terrors
to 31 for 82 from the floor while
WMC's man-to-man defense only held
the Generals to 34 for 63, or 54%.

As a team the Generals showed the
success of their control, offense and
hustling defense. Four men on the
squad were in double figures. “Magic”
Mel Cartwright scored 15, making
drives and reverse lay-ups against two
and three defenders. Morrison hit for
14 points of which six baskets were
form the 20-25 foot range.

Fauber also made 14 points and
showed strength on the boards and
on drives, Charlie Stone connected
for 5 and displayed his passing and
dribbling talent. Mike Daniel and
Earl Edwards came off the bench
early in the game to score 7 and 2
points respectively.

The Washington and Lee squad
has shown how good it really is in
the last three wins over Navy, Roa-

noke and Western Maryland. The
biggest question left for the squad

is how well can it do on the road
without the home court advantage.

Assistant Sports Editor
“We're very optimistic about the
future, but we're also very proud

of our accomplishments.” Those were
the words of Washington and Lee’s
young and dynamic head basketball
coach, Verne Canfield.

Coach Canfield has been instru-
mental in transforming W&L’s basket-
ball squad from a push-over to a
Virginia small college power. In the
last two seasons his teams have had
records of 20-5 and 19-6 and in
addition they have won the C.A.C.
Championship each year,

This season

Canfield is proud to claim.

Why is Washington and Lee hav-
ing such a fine season? According to
the coach, “Our boys have a great
deal of pride, not only in their team
but also in Washington and Lee.
Each of the players has been getting
his job done well, especially Mike
Neer, who has had some exceptional
games recently in terms of scoring.”

When asked about the controversial
Roanoke College game, Coach Can-
field had several things to set straight
“Despite what the Roanoke papers
said, the crowd didn’t win the game
for Washington and Lee—the team
did. | don't mean to say the crowds
don't help, because they do and I'm
happy to see so many people con
cerned about our team, But I don't

Coach Canfield then went on to
give his thoughts about the rest of
the season. “If we win our next two
games we'll be the Virginia small
college champions, which would be
quite an accomplishment when you
consider all the subsidized schools in
the state. At the beginning of the
season we had six tough games on
the schedule. Only one of these games
is lefti—the Quantico Marines, a very
talented ball club.”

“Our team has done a good job
and now we have two big goals,
Number one is winning the state

championship and number two in tak-

Coach Canfield was quite frank
about the loss to Asheville-Biltmore

WAL is centered around the car and
the fraternity, an unfortunate situa-
tion for students lacking either or
both. The rat race of “going down
the road” every weekend is a far
from satisfactory social life.

Obviously the W&L physical plant
cannot presently facilitate a coeduca-
tional University. But additions, some
needed with or without coeducation,
could be made to allow coeducation
within three years. Until that time,
W&L could follow the lead of Prince-
ton and Yale in bringing in girls for
week long visits as interested—and
interesting—observers. Another pos-
sibility would be consolidation with
one of the nearby women’s colleges.

Society no longer attempts to
separate the sexes. W&L shouldn't
either if it hopes to be a_ truly
twentieth century institution,
Dance Board

(Continued from Page 2)

More practical methods of arrang-
ing the gym for concerts have now
been employed, the main one being
that the members of the Advisory
Board set up the tarp which covers
the gym. The salary of the president
has now been eliminated, and now
only the officers of the Board receive
free dance plans.

Studies are now being undertaken
to discover a more profitable way of
selling tickets, such that one day
individual tickets will be sold to stu-
dents. One idea is that tickets be
offered to the area schools, so that
more people will have the opportunity
to purchase a ticket. Also, the idea
of coordinating a concert with another
local college is being considered; this
would undoubtedly secure a large
number of students and make indi-
vidual tickets sales more realistic.

The financial situation could now
only be worsened if individual tickets
were sold and dance plans were made
transferrable, thus causing a lack of
ready cash. With transferrable plans
students would not be as inclined to
buy them, rather sharing them or
purchasing them jointly, If individual
tickets were available, the Board
would not have the needed cash on
hand to pay groups in advance; also,
if a group were somewhat unpopular
or if the weekend conflicted with a
more appealing one at another school,
the loss of income would be so drastic
as to impair or eliminate one of the
other dance sets.

The Board is also doing all that
it can to improve the quality of the
concerts. First of all, it is attempting
to obtain the use of the VMI Field-
house for Springs; the acoustics would
be better, the viewing would be more
pleasurable, the fire hazards would
be eliminated, and the capacity would
be increased. Through preferential
sheets, they are trying to discover
what type of entertainment the stu-
dent body wishes. In this way they
can book acts which would prove
most appealing to the audiences,

The last main point of dispute is
its structure. The main criticism here
is that of its self-perpetuation of its
membership, which comes actually
from lack of interest more than fra-
ternity inbreeding. The Dance Ad-
visory Board was created to serve as
a proving ground for future mem-
bers, but few applications for posi-
tions on the Dance Board come from
this group. Thus, it can be easily
premised that only a certain group
of people are so oriented as to want
to join the Board, definitely not most
people.

The second point of criticism con-
cerns the election of the vice-presi-
dent, who unquestionably ascends to
the presidency. First of all the vice-
president is selected as an understudy
of the president, so that he will
understand how to handle the many
problems which are involved in plan-
ning concerts, Next, it is an assurance
that an upper-classman will remain
on the Board, so that he will be
able to relay his experience to the
younger members of the group.

I can thus only conclude that
most of the criticism against the
Dance Board up to this time has
been nonfactual and has been based
mostly upon opinion. The Board is
making a consistent and conscienti-
ous effort to improve its shortcom-
ings and is attempting to please the
students to the best of its ability, The
amount of criticism has been wholly
unjustified in proportion to the great
amount of time and labor which is
given by these ten men, and gratitude,
rather than insult, should be given
to the Board for the inglorious duty
which it accomplishes to the best of
its ability.

movement in 1964—once a philosophy
major at Berkeley—describes the at-
titude of the administration as one
of men who think that history has
stopped: all constructive and worth-
while changes already embraced; room
for no more. And so the leaders at
SF State with actions of boycott and
disruption tell the administrators that
they will be allowed to ignore the
thrust for change no longer.

The cause embraced by these leaders
at SF State is the destruction of the
administrative aspects of higher edu-
cation in the state: a return to the
community of scholars ... The high
and middle roads of the tri-parte

American mind—all comfortably
within the system—will issue the call:
“clear the campus, get back to

schoolin,.” Even the old left will
write articles in the NY Times ad-
vising activity through channels, And
never will any of these advisors get
alt why these students are endanger-
ing their status as members of the
releative utopian found within the
groves of acadame: TOO OFTEN IN
THE PAST HAVE CHANNELS
FOR CONSTRUCTIVE CHANGE
BEEN SLAMMED SHUT: | free
speech in ‘64, Eldridge Cleaver on
campus in ‘68, Afro-American studies
in 69, and years of grief in between.
Today the status quo includes a
radical student left, making their
presence known, Now what is to be
done?

The honest concern for a_ better
way that motivates most of these
radicalized students must be acknow-
ledged. If these students allow the
end to justify the means, look to the
response afforded them when they
did operate within the system. If
minds were closed even to the pos-
sibility that they were presenting
valid alternatives, if fellow students,
teachers, and administrators attempted
io impose what was thought to be
better judgment on them, can these
radical dissentors now be blamed for
turning the tables?

To the most telling question: how
will the better educated and more
socially aware high school students
of today be greeted by American

EC report

(Continued from Page 1)
Horowitz, chairman of the Student
Civil Liberties Committee, would not
be forthcoming with his recommenda-
tions until just before Spring Vaca-
tion. Phil Thompson suggested Horo-
witz focus on philosophies and mea-
sures germaine to the needs of the
WAL campus instead of directing its
inquiries to other schools.

On the matter of the initiation of
a speed-reading clinic for W&L stu-
dents—free—Steve Sandler suggested
the EC contact an employee of The
Evelyn Wood School of Reading
Dynamics who lives in Buena Vista
and inquire as to the availability of
her services. Sandler noted the recent
solicitations made by that organiza-
tion, but said though the course was
reputed to be excellent, it was also
expensive (ca, $125 per pupil).

Jay Passavant referred to the Bitch-
in, out of which came suggestions
for constitutional revision, in asking
Joe Thompkins to join Dean Kum-
puris and Dave Shufflebarger to
examine the student body's constitu-
tion for conclusiveness, degree of
coverage, timeliness, and relevance to
the student body of today.

The Virginia Association of Stu-
dent Governments will meet on Thurs-
day, Feb. 20, at Hampden-Sidney,
where Dean Rusk is tentatively sched-
uled to speak. Rob Turnbull, Rob
Bauer, Joe Thompkins, Danny Lean-
ard, and Passavant will attend.

Rob Bauer reported on a sug-
gestion that films be shown in duPont
Hall to the student body on a regular
basis. He said that Journalism Prof.
Jennings could provide services in
obtaining films and had a massive
listing of all films available, ranging
in price from $25 to $100 plus show-
ing and attendance surchages. The
problem connected with such an en-

 

terprise is the financing. Several
showings of one film a month could
be done for about $1,500, but unless
the University would be willing to
underwrite the effort (the EC is look-
ing into that), then an assessment
would have to be made at the begin-
ning of school, and admission
charge of 25 cents levied.

Some mention was made of the
Southern Collegian’s having collected
funds at the beginning of the year and
then having not so far issued a
magazine, but the EC is powerless to
act in such an extra-University mat-
ter.

Jorge Estrada: “Where can I start?”

Jay Passavant: “Well, you can
start with what happened to our $50.”
[Laughter.]

Such was the beginning of Estrada’s
appearance before the EC. He said
the money had been used in cor-
respondence to 63 schools soliciting
delegations to the Mock OAS. So far,
7 replies have come. Estrada said
that although he was disappointed in
the lack of interest shown, especially
by Virginia schools, he expected 7 or
8 more acceptances to come in. The
balance of the 21 delegation council
would be provided by Washington
and Lee students,

Scheduled for appearance before
the EC next week are Swede Hen-
berg (Curriculum Committee Chair-
man), Bill Gottwald (for the As-
similation Committee), and Hank
Graddy, Ken Cribb, Guy Glenn, and
Ron Kessler (concerning Mock Con-
vention debts). The EC is presently
accepting applications for positions on
the 1972 Mock Convention, includ-
ing 2 freshman positions as Interim
Co-chairmen. They should be mailed
to Jay Passavant at the Pi Kappa
Alpha House. —Larry Honig

UFO’s
(Continued from Page 1)

No one else saw the object that
night, and many of the viewers began
to wonder about themselves, but when
the fireball reappeared three nights
later it became obvious that some-
thing was going on. On Tuesday night

time over the Stonewall Jackson
Hospital. It dropped another “bomb”
which fell soundlessly to the earth,
then gathered up speed and headed
off to “attack” Roanoke.

The neighbors on Taylor St. tried
hard, but could not come up with
any reasonable explanation of the
phenomenon. Many of them had
thought that it might be a meteor,
however, the fact that it was cloudy
both nights seemed to rule out that
possibility, especially because the
UFO was seen from so far off. The
fireball was suspended well up in the
air, so it couldn’t have been a police
or ambulance flasher. Not to men-
tion that fire trailed behind it.

The whole affair was given official
credence the following night, Janu-
ary 18. While patrolling the streets
on duty, a policeman from the Bed-
ford, Va. Sheriff's Office sighted
another red fiery UFO flashing across
the skies, The officer first thought that
it was an airplane, but then the
object exploded in mid-air and dis-
appeared. The Sheriff's Office report-
ed that “the officer went over to the
area where it exploded but he couldn't
find anything.” In the three weeks
since the UFO was seen, the Bedford
Sheriff has yet to come up with a
lead. No traces of an exploded ob-
ject have been found, and the fire-

ball which the officer described
matches that of the UFO seen in
Lexington,

Nothing more has been heard of
the “saucer” since the explosion on
the 18th. It might seem very funny
to dismiss the reports as the product
of individual imaginations, but there
were nearly twenty people who saw
the UFO in Lexington.
