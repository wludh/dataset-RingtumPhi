REVIEW and OUTLOOK

The natural bridge {I}

In the first edition of this newspaper, we tried to point
out the disadvantages of freshman camp at Natural Bridge
tend to outweigh the advantages, how the very valuable aspects
of pre-matriculation orientation are often lost in the childish
and annoying fare that typify freshman camp. We weren’t
successful; no one in the administration seems to place a re-
evaluation of the present orientation on any list of priorities
at all.

This edition surveyed a random sampling of the freshman
class, 103 of those enrolled (which means that hypothesizing
about the entire class will be extremely accurate.) A majority
(57°,) felt that freshman camp contributed to, rather than
detracted from, their ability to adjust to Washington and Lee.
And 78°, replied that the goals of camp are legitimate. This
is certainly encouraging, but...

To the question, “Would you be in favor of or opposed
to the continuation of freshman camp as it now exists?”, 67%
said they would be opposed. And, 85% favored moving fresh-
man camp to the campus.

Note that the feeling is that the goals of freshman camp
are recognized as valuable, and even more are accepted.
But why must there be a camp held in adverse conditions
15 miles away from the campus? Freshman assimilation could
be so much more pleasant and very likely more beneficial if
it were effected right here on campus.

Staff editorial

In defense of liberal education

One of the explicit purposes of this University is “to pro-
vide the essentials of a liberal education to all undergraduates
before they separate into their fields of specialization;” (page
49, Catalogue). With due regard to the atmosphere of change
circulating between the columns of our staid colonnade, we
earnestly hope that the faculty will not abandon this objective
in its action on the Curriculum Committee’s proposals con-
cerning reform of the distribution requirements.

As we all know, the current instrument used to accomplish
this purpose is the distribution requirement. Most students
apparently prefer some reform in this system due to the drudg-
ery of toiling through required courses which are often not
relevant to their own particular interests. However, how
many freshmen and sophomores are absolutely sure of what
their particular interests are? We suggest that a majority of
students graduate with a different major than the one they
intended to pursue when they entered W&L. Perhaps, with-
out adequate distribution, these students might not have come
to this realization.

Distribution requirements do perform a necessary function
in enhancing the possibility of using more intelligent freedom
in making a wise choice of a major. Even in those cases when
a student may actually be ready to specialize in his select dis-
cipline in his freshman year, distribution prevents him from
gaining an undesirable lopsided approach to knowledge.

The issue puzzling the Curriculum Committee is not
whether breadth is necessary to a liberal education—we agree,
it simply is—but whether a wide perspective should be en-
couraged or required.

Having considered these observations, we urge that the
minority recommendation of the Curriculum Committee's pro-
posals for distribution reform be more closely followed (see
last week’s Tuesday Ring-tum Phi). Basically, the minority
recommendation requires certain specifics of all graduates and
a broader learning experience than the majority recommenda.
tion. We feel that the requirements of the major recom-
mendation are too lax to ensure adequate breadth, For ex:
ample, a student could feasibly graduate without ever taking
an English course! Granted English courses do not appeal
to each and every student here, but English is an essential
and necessary part of a liberal arts curriculum—perhaps the
upper level courses would be more appealing and challenging
to freshmen with four entrance units of credit (required). |

We suggest that the faculty consider abolishing certain
prerequisite courses as a means of requiring breadth of study
on a reformed basis. For example, the minority recommenda.
tion requires six credits in English, but why does this have to
be English 1, 2 (prerequisites for most higher level courses)
For a student to take a course in English which really chal-
lenged his interests, he would under usual circumstances have
to wait until his sophomore year. The preservation of prere-
quisites in cases like this, somewhat offsets the advantageous
decrease in number of hours for distribution.

This points out another significant advantage in the mi-
nority recommendation—the provision allowing distribution
requirements to be used for major requirements should they
coincide. This is especially valuable in departments such as
economics where the average student is unexposed to such
study in high school. In these cases introductory courses are
definitely necessary to enable the student to lay a foundation
in his freshman year for later study. This would also give
the student time in his second year to investigate the subject
deeper before deciding in what area he will specialize.

In short, the current system of distribution, while fulfilling
a just and necessary purpose, does need a certain easing 2
clear the path for more flexibility. However, caution shoul
© as not to relax restrictions to the point where the
desirable end—ensuring the broad

From the J-School...

By LAURENCE M,. HILLIARD
Columnist

Last week at dinner, a_ student
looked up from my column in The
Ring-tum Phi asked me “Why do
you always knock the University?
Why don't you ever say anything
nice about it? Isn't there anything
you like about Washington and Lee?”

Since I admire the courage of
anyone who will read my column
while eating, I feel he deserves an
answer. The reason | am always
Knocking W&L is because I see my-
self, the columnist, as a sort of un-
glorified social commentator. There
are many things | like about the
University, but there are also some
things | do not like, and I hope that
by presenting my beefs in print, I
can, in some small way, contribute
to the rectification of these situations.

My first column three weeks ago
extolled the virtues of coeducation.
Since that time, a faculty member has
circulated a petition for coeducation
at W&L. I do not know if my column
contributed to this turn of events,
but I like to feel that it provided
well needed food for thought on the

subject. My next column was on
campus apathy—an article which
drew a letter of attack from Tom

Whetstone. Although I do not agree
with Mr. Whetstone’s views, I am
encouraged that he took the time to
write the letter. Obviously, he is
neither apathetic nor indifferent to

easy to practice flagellation and be-
moan that Big Issue, the Bogeyman
(or Blue Meanie?) of all campuses:
Apathy. Define the indecipherable.
We can't, they can't. But, I dare
Suggest that like so many reformers
they find it far easier to debate the
number of devils on the head of a
pin than to clear off one.

Talk is cheap, me Irish mother
used to say. But then, so is all
movement. And we must never. chil-
dren, confuse movement with action.
A dynamite blast below the statue
of Cyrus McCormick: that’s move-
ment. It gets you nowhere. Or to
be more specific: tackle a problem
by appointing a committee. Again
we usually find ourselves nowhere—
through more subtly so. To repeat,
talk is cheap.

After much deliberation the Cur-
riculum Committee issues its recom-
mendations, emphasizing research,
individual initiative, the unbinding of
the vigorous mind to journeys of in-

 

 

campus events. I plan to continue
writing controversial articles in the
hope that I can arouse student  in-
terest and action.

But getting back to the original
question—there are things I like
about W&L. So for this week, I am
going to put away my poison pen
long enough to tell of some of these
things I do like.

Washington and Lee has two ma-
jor advantages going for it—an ex-
cellent faculty and an equally excel-
lent reputation, Take away either,
and you would inevitably lose the
other. An excellent faculty is neces-
sary for the maintainance of the
reputation and an excellent reputa-
tion is necessary in order to attract a
high quality faculty.

The Ring-tum Phi conducted a
student rating of faculty members in
December, About 40 percent of the
senior class graded faculty members
in six categories from 1—‘Superior”
—to 5S—‘Terrible.” The Ring-tum
Phi commented on the results, saying,
“The students were, on the whole,
too lenient . . . . The mean score
for the entire faculty for each
criterion should be ‘Average,” ie., 3.
For five of the six criteria the aver-
age (mean) is lower, and thus more
favorable to the faculty.” This is not
surprising, The faculty is far better
than “Average,” as the poll indicates.
Sure there are some clinkers in the

One cargazon of ramblings

; tellect yet uncharted. Bully for you,
Curriculum Committee. And a double |

huzzah for those fiery revolutionaries
led by Dave Katz who have emerged
from the bowels of the Library with
the Student Progressive Alliance
(sounding oddly reminiscent of T.R.’s
Progressive Party and of the Farm-
er’s Alliance, both founded o’er a
half century ago. Crafty young
radicals.) Hurrah for these groups who
decry apathy on the campus that
General Lee built! And when the
cheers have ended and the lights in
the zealot’s eyes are dulled, what
then? There are sixty-nine organs of
the Student Body listed in the Uni-
versity Register. We don't count the
officers of the classes or the Ex-
ecutive Committee or the fraternities.
We don't count the prestigious John
W. Davis Society (headed by the
President of or the Freeport Tuna
Society “All men are basically fish.”)

We assume these organs to be
functioning with one or several mem-
bers apiece, Certainly when a relative-
ly small student population such as
ours is, Can support some three score

W&L ain’t so bad after all

faculty—it’s inevitable. But they are
scarce. In three years, I’ve only had
two poor professors and about ten
that are excellent. The poll listed
eighteen professors with an overall
performance rating of “Superior.” The
greatest compliment that can be given
a professor is to have a student take
his course just to have the professor—
a common occurence at W&L. How
many students do you know who will
take a course from a Dr, Colvin or
a Dr. Jarrett because of the profes-
sor. Presently | am taking Sociology
102 because of Dr. Leyburn. (In case
you think I’m saying this to get a
better grade, let the record show that
I'm taking the course pass/fail.)

An excellent reputation is not as
tangible as an excellent faculty, but
it is no less important. If you do not
believe this, just wait until you apply
for employment or graduate school.
Or better yet, tell anybody in the
South where you go to college, and
I guarantee that they will be duly
impressed,

I could mention many other things
I like about W&L—a President who
will talk to anybody on any subject
at almost any time, an athletic pro-
gram that allows any student  in-
terested to compete on the varsity
level, a newspaper that prints my
trash every week—but I have to end
now in order to sharpen up my fangs
for an attack on some unsuspecting
element of campus life next week.

 

not apathetic.

| So mirable dictu, the dragon be-
, comes a windfall and we can all go

_my fine laddie-bucks!

To quote another economics major,
“There is a spectre stalking . . .” One
might suggest that the spectre is not
apathy but mediocrity, a complacent
attitude toward quality. (How else do
you think newspapers such as_ this
one, and its fin de semaine counter-
part survive?).

If it doesn't charley-horse an un-
used muscle, think about the stand-
ards maintained in this red-bricked
microcosm. One's mind boggles at the
lack of excellence. We could tiptoe
lightly across the toes of the three
score and some odd Presidents, Chair-
men and Fuhrers of the campus
organizations, We could trod upon
them sharply. We shall do neither,
or now, and leave this cargazon of
medocrity to your imagination, One
only suggests that we appraise. Look
to yourselves and your leaders. “Many
are chosen but few are called.” (or

to this gentleman for his efforts.

He enjoys the luxury of his youth
(his missive got on to the point
that your typesetter tired and put
“treat” for “threat”). Recourse to
Roget, 3.1; “Objectivity” should give
him a lead to the definition of “Uni-

is quite definitely “Thesis Material”
and hope that he will use the talents
of a finely honed mind to produce
further and expanded material. If he

Baffling outburst

Editor, The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi:

To the Phi’s recent and truly
baffling outburst of demagogy on the
the “other side of Lexington” it seems
in order to offer some manner of
reply and rebuke. This writer's
indignation over the public airing of
such a matter is almost too deep to
find adequate expression, Still .
one tries. Perhaps it will suffice to
establish, at least to propose, a single
point, The advancement of civilzation
has invariably been achieved through
the cultivation of the arts and the
direction of politics by a relatively
privileged class (or alliance of classes)
whose life-laboring and sometimes im-
poverished inferiors have been obliged
to support and to render as easy as
circumstances permitted. Concern for
the conditions of daily existence
among these unfortunate was not, and
presumably could not wisely have
been, keenly felt by the genteel classes.
To toss down a few crumbs from
the table was enough — “noblesse
oblige,” but not extravagantly! It ap-
pears quite legitimate, and at this
moment necessary to wonder whether
the Sistine frescoes, the Medici
tombs, the palaces and pavilions of
Versailles, and the work of Haydn
and Mozart would have come into
the world if Popes and kings and
merchants and nobles had not largely
ignored what our great-grandparents
called “the social question” and opted
instead for art and beauty. (Only in
the twentieth century have we dis-
covered how easily art and beauty
can be divorced.)

The question, in short, is entirely

Bucky Cunningham

Bucky Cunningham didn’t even go}
out for football in his freshman and |
sophomore years, but after two years |
of astounding success, Bucky finds
himself leaving W&L with two all-

time school grid records. Now, he
also finds himself as the Ring-tum
Phi’s Football Player of the Year.

It may seem surprising that an

offensive player could be chosen from
a team which found so much dif-
ficulty in scoring, especially at the
beginning of the year, Bucky's ac-
complishments can hardly be exag-
gerated, though, Last year in his first
year of football, Bucky set the W&L
record for most receptions in a sea-
son. In this, his senior and final
season, he celebrated by tying his
record of a year old and adding to
it the mark for most passing yardage

Mel Cartwright

Mel Cartwright, a PiKA from
Martinsville, Virginia has established
himself as one of the best basketball
players in the state by his junior
year. As a freshman, “Magic” Mel
was a small college All-American
honorable mention. This year, Mel
led the team in scoring with almost
a 20-point-per-game average; and
once again made the all conference
squad,

Phroughout the state, Cartwright
has amazed his opponents with his
floating lay-ups and his receptive pass-
ing. Mel has also taken his share of

 

punishment under the boards where
he has the team’s record for most!
rebounds in one game.

Whenever Mel Cartwright had}
teamed with W&L’s other big man, |
Mike Neer, he was unstoppable. |
These two provided the Generals!
with the offensive punch that led the |
squad to the Virginia small college |
title.

Cartwright continued to pour on
the points as he broke the 1000 mark
early this season. But more im-
portant was the fact that he led
the squad in assists.

But meeting Mel
would never guess that he was a}
star athlete. Despite the fact that
Mel loves to talk about basketball, |
he never mentions that he was All-}
American in both high and |
college. A serious student, Mel is an)

Harry Zeliff

Player of the Year from Washing-
ton and Lee's cross-country team is
team captain Harry Zeliff. Harry, a
senior PhiEP from Staunton, Vir-
ginia, led his squad to a winning 6-5
season.

At the outset of the season, Zelifl
set a course record for W&L as the
Harriers jumped off to a quick 4-0
record. The cross country team ran
into strong state competition later in
the season but finished third in the
College Athletic Conference meet in
Danville, Kentucky.

Harry Zeliff is to be succeeded by
David Haydu and Paul Wilbur, co-
captains of the 1969 cross-country
season. Hopefully, they will be able
to provide the same effective leader-
ship which characterized Zeliff and
earned him the title Player of the
Year.

Besides his athletic activities, Harry
has involved himself in many other
extracurricular obligations. He has
served as an officer in his fraternity;
and he has also been active in both
the Troubadour Theater and the
Circle K. Finally, Zeliff has been on
the Dean’s List for the past two
years, —Cal Whitehurst

the Honor System Committee estab-
lished to investigate procedural
changes in the System. The pro-
posals contained herein are the re-
sult of considerable discussion among
both other EC members and the three
faculty advisors President Huntley,
Mr. McThenia of the Law School,
and Dean of Students Atwood. The
study stemmed from the Executive
Committee’s concern over the in-
justces and inconsistencies inevitable
in the present procedure. At the out-
set, it would be profitable to outline
the framework in which this commit-
tee contained its activities and based
its decision.
1) The Executive Committee shall re-
tain its present organizational struc-
ture.
2) The Executive Committee shall
maintain its role of an investigatory
body in all honor cases. Its purpose
shall be to ascertain the facts and to
render a judgement based on those
facts. Any movement toward an ad-
versary system should be avoided.
3) A greater degree of consistency
between EC hearing and Student Body
hearing should be sought. The em-
phasis in both cases should be on
gathering the facts of the case and
not on civil procedure,
4) An effort should be made to insure
the knowledge of the accused con-
cerning the case.
In accordance with the above
guidelines, Mr. Hendricks and | have
developed the following procedural
changes and recommend that they
be adopted by the Executive Com-
mittee. These proposals have also met

with the approval of our faculty
advisors to this committee. It is our
joint consensus that all of these

recommendations are in the best in-
terests of the Student Body and the
Honor System at Washington and
ise.

1) The Executive Commitee should
follow a modified procedure prior to
the beginning of a hearing as fol-
lows. After a suspected honor viola-
tion, a number of Committeemen
shall gather evidence. The entire EC

| will be called together and determine
| whether or not a hearing is necessary.

If so, all witnesses must be con-
tacted prior to $:00 p.m. the day
of the hearing. The accused must be
informed of his status with a brief
description of the offense involved
no later than §:00 p.m. of the day
or the hearing, but not before 4:00
p.m. the same day. The EC hearing
will begin at 7:00 p.m. or for good
reason, at President's discretion.

(The accused will be told pre-
cisely of what he is accused, On
suggestions by Steve Sandler, 1)
24 hours instead of 2 will be given
the accused party. Our readers will
remember that Ron Kessler sug-
gested such an amendment at an
earlier EC meeting. 2) The accused
will be required to read and sign
a statement consisting of his rights
and the procedure.)

2) Every accused student be

| accused student to be present through-
j out the questioning of witnesses and
all other procedings of the EC hear-
ing except the deliberation of the EC
Which can occur at any time. In
addition, the accused will be given
time to ask questions of the witnesses
only after all EC questioning is com-
pleted. (The EC reserves the right to
ask questions at any time), The fol-
lowing are proposals for modifications
of the Student Body Hearing:

1) The Chairman of the hearing shall
be the President of the Student Body
or in his absence, the Vice-President.

(Another EC member may be
designated Chairman. The accused
may suggest to the President that
any particular person not be Chair-
man, which suggestion the Presi-
dent may accept or reject.)

2) It shall be the duty of the Chair-
man to present a brief summary of
the facts of the case in question to
the jury prior to the presentation
of testimony.

(The “facts” here must be the
same ones disclosed in the original
EC trial. Counsel for the accused
must approve them beforehand.)
| 3) Every effort should be made to
| keep the hearing free of legal loop-
| holes and technicalities. To that end,
ithe Chairman shall have final de-
i termination of all rules of procedure
and evidence. The hearing should be
conducted as a fact-finding investiga-
tion, not as a civil court proceeding.
(The jury will be allowed a pause
for recess affer both cases, that
for the defense and that for the
prosecution, so that they may write
down notes without interrupting or
ignoring continuing testimony.

4) The advisor to the aceused  stu-
dent should be an undergraduate, as
should the EC counsel, possibly a
member of the EC. W&L Law School
advisors to undergraduate students
are undesirable but not prohibited.
5) Following the examination of any
witness, the members of the jury may
have the opportunity to ask questions
of the witnesses or recall any witness
will be at the direction of the
Chairman,

6) The number of preemptory chal-
lenges to jury selection will be in-
creased from (4) to ten (10) for each
side.

7) It will be the responsibility of
the Chairman to appoint two mem-
bers of the jury to give “guilty” and
“not guilty” summations.

This commitiee also strongly

 

recommends that such changes as
above not be included as amendments
to the Student Body Consitution. It
is our feeling that such action would
destroy the flexibility of the ad-
ministration of the Honor System and
would eventually lead to undesirable
and unchangeable situations.
* *

Point number 3, the right of the
accused to be present during question-
ing of the witnesses, was included (ac-
cording to Hendricks and Passavant)
in an effort to make secret honor trial
procedure consistent with student
body hearing procedure.

Concerning student body hearings,
point number 3 concerning “loop-
holes” was a marked change from the
present system whereby  Viriginia
Codes are employed as procedural
guides,

Secretary Judson Simmons suggest-
ed that in selecting the prospective
jury list from the student body, the
EC should include ex officio the fra-
ternity presidents, chairmen of stand-
ing committees, etc., to ensure a more
responsible jury. His arguments in
favor of this system were that less
peremptory “strikes” would be used
since both counsel would be assured
of perhaps a better general calibre.

oe

EC recommendations on the Honor System presented to students

The arguments against this idea were
that many names would be duplicates
and that this was not “jury of his
peers” in its bias. The suggestion was
not adopted.

Ron Kessler, the sole spectator
(Editor’s note: where are all those
who complain about secrecy,  ete.,

such as Jeff Spence, Jack Horowitz,
and the PSA? Sorry, couldn't resist
this.), suggested that the student body
be allowed to express its sentiments
on the recommenadtions by voting in
the Spring. He added that this would
not take the form of a Constitutional
amendment, but would be effected
only to gain a consensus, or lack of
it. The EC concurred with this recom-
mendation.

Also discussed at some was the
question of where a student body
hearing should be held. Passavant

said that all three advisors had been
in agreement that the new EC room
in the student union building should
be used. There was general objection
from the EC to this, however, on the
bases of 1) general disruption and
2) limited audience (which, however,
most agreed would not be entirely
objectionable.) The EC resolved, by

 

8-4 vote, to retain Lee Chapel as
the site.
