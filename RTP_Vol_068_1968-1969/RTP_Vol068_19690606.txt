Each generation, shaped by forces outside and within it, asks the question
it must ask. Some generations, concerned with the building of a nation, ask |

“How?” Other generations, needing
“What?”

Your generation has asked “Why?”

As Americans we must together ask

find answers. How we build a better America, what kind of nation we want,

why we pursue certain goals instead

be faced by one generation and ignored by another. All of us must face them.

A college education in the humanities and sciences teaches us that the real
power to deal with these problems comes out of the human mind and the
human heart. All power must be disciplined by trained intelligence and

tempered by compassion.

Each of you is a center of power. Your professional or social or religious
or political activity will determine the shape of the future of your nation

and of the world.

The question asked by your generation—-Why?—is one that must be answered

REVIEW and OUTLOOK

Editorial Opinion Of The Tuesday Ring-tum Phi
Washington and Lee University’s Twice-Weekly Newspaper

Graduation Day—1969

 

 

 

To the entering freshmen

You, as soon-to-be freshmen at Washington and Lee Uni-
versity, are entering upon a new way of life. The next four
years could possibly be four of the happiest and most pro-
ductive years in your life. The challenge to make these four
years your best confronts each of you personally. What you
do here will depend on you alone. What you get out of W&L
will depend on you alone. The opportunity is provided; the
responsibility is yours.

You are entering your college life in a time of great soul-
searching on college campuses across the nation. Faculty and
students alike are re-examining their values. As freshmen at
W&L, the responsibility is yours to participate in this process.
Deliberative self-evaluation and self-criticism yield growth and
maturity. Washington and Lee grows constantly—but growth
here comes rationally, not haphazardly—and as the University
grows and matures, the students who are the University, grow
and mature.

If you shirk your responsibility to your school, if you
don’t participate in the self-evaluation process, you will betray
not only your school, you will betray yourselves. As freshmen
here, you can be a part of the changes and traditions that are
Washington and Lee University.

This year a record number of changes were initiated which
will be in their infancy next year. The responsibility is yours
to carry them into adulthood. The responsibility is yours to
get the most benefit from them. Get involved! The greatest
feature of Washington and Lee is the opportunity for all its
students to join in the whole life of the University community.
Here, your professors will be far more than willing to listen to
you, to evaluate what you say, and to change—when change
is needed. Here, you will be able to know your professors al-
most as well as you know your best friend. Here, you will be
able to know the first name of most of your fellow students.
Here, at Washington and Lee if you accept your responsibility,
you will find that smallness in size makes possible the develop-
ment of an intangible feeling of companionship unavailable
anywhere else. This companionship—student to student, stu-
dent to professor—makes Washington and Lee the outstand- |
ing University it is.

Without your help though, we can go no further. You will
be the first freshmen to enjoy for a full year the privileges
of a five-day class week; the liberalized dormitory rules; the
new student center. More changes are in store: a 12-12-6 tri-
mester will probably go into effect your sophomore year; con-
struction on a practially new gymnasium, twice the size of the
one now, will begin this summer; co-education may be a fact
before you graduate. Make the most of your opportunity.

You have a busy but wonderful four years ahead, and
your responsibility is tremendous—for the next four years you
are Washington and Lee. Study and participate. Accept change
but keep alive the traditions that have made Washington
and Lee great. You will leave after four years a Washington
and Lee man and with a teardrop in your eye be forever grate-

ful for it. —R.H.Y.

If taking over the administration |

building or destroying university prop- |
erty are “where it’s at,” Washington |
and Lee University’s students have
been apathetically “out of it” this
year.
To the contrary, the 1968-69 aca-
demic year was marked by what
many observers believe was a high
degree of student and faculty activism
at Washington and Lee, a private
liberal arts institution where tradition
has often been more noteworthy than |
upheaval.

The activism came NOT in storm-
ing walls but in implementing aca-
demic and social changes that ma-
jorities of both the faculty and student
body desired at WAL.

“The average student at Washing-
ton and Lee can see that things are
changing and are changing for his
benefit,” commented Jay Passavant,
this year’s student government presi-
dent. “This fact takes away much of
the initiative for protest.”

Within the past year, the faculty
has approved, following student en-

Rather than being the direct re-

students played an important role
in endorsing the changes.

a wing of the student government,
“worked hand-in-hand with the fac-
ulty curriculum committee,” Passa-
vant noted. When the question of
changing the curriculum came to a

From the new EC president

 

To the class of ’73

By SWEDE HENBERG
Student Body President

Recently I have heard several
upperclassmen remark that they wish
they were entering Washington and
Lee as a freshman this fall. Of course
these students are only half-serious,
but their comments indicate an at-
mosphere of increased confidence in
the future of the university. Beyond
any doubt, the options open to the
class of 1973 will far exceed those
Open to any previous class in the
school’s history.

New curriculum changes will make
possible a wider range of academic
involvement during the freshman
year, Later, when next fall’s fresh-
men become upperclassmen, the pos-
sibility of independent study in any
number of areas will be open to
them. Next year’s freshman will—also
for the first time—have the privilege
of female visitation in the dormitories
on weekends. These two very im-
portant changes combine to expand
the freedom and responsibility of
Washington and Lee students.

Quite probably, however, the great-
est advantage of the new measures
adopted this spring is that they in-
crease the self-governing aspect of
student life. A liberal education is not
something forced upon students; they
must themselves question and let that
be motivation for inquiry. Thus, from
now on, a freshman will have to
rely upon his own capacity for choos-
ing to get as broad a perspective as
possible. Exposure to certain realms
of knowledge will no langer be man-
datory. This fact might be harmful
in a few instances where students
choose to limit themselves, but I
think the added freedom will pro-
vide advantages that far surpass any
disadvantages.

Regulation of the new dormitory
provisions will, as with everything
else concerning student life, be en-
tirely student- controlled. Again re-
sponsibility increases along with the
additional freedom. Yet prospective
freshman should not get the impres-
sion that this is a mere experiment to
see how well the students respond

these changes
formulated, one theme remained con-
stant throughout—that of absolute

their own affairs.

In recent years the whole concept
of assimilation into Washington and
Lee has changed. Fewer and fewer
rules and regulations have been im-
posed, as is evidenced by the two
recent changes I have just discussed,
The whole emphasis has been on
flexibility—with the realization that
strict regulations often invite students
to flaunt them. The Honor System
itself has been modified so that it
better serves the Student Body. Add-
ed flexibility in defending the rights
of the accused should not be in-
terpreted as a weakening of the Honor
System. I think it can be now said
that the new stipulations make it nec-
essary for the Executive Committee to
regard all students (including defend-
ants) equally until an accusation is
proved,

Thus I would encourage entering
freshmen to first familiarize them-
selves with all summer mailings—
particularly because several of them
will contain information on_ the
changes for next year. Once on
campus the freshman should be aware
that all decisions are his. Personally
I think choosing whether or not to
join a fraternity will slowly become
as large a question as what fraternity
to join has been in the past. This
too is good, because it further en-
larges a freshman’s breadth of choice.

1 can only urge, then, that the
freshman hold himself open to the
different alternatives presented. When
deciding on extra-curricular activities,
a student should remember that any
decisions he makes at the beginning
of the year is not binding. Possibili-
ties remain open for all four years
at Washington and Lee. In reality
the most often imposed limitation at
WAL is not external; it is not through
rules and through the boundaries of
already established organizations that
a student finds himself frustrated. No,
much more common than this is self-
limitation, and that proves eventually
the most frustrating boundary of all.

A Message to the New Students

The traditions of Washington and Lee University require conven-
tional dress. Our shop, in keeping with these traditions, is designed
solely for the W&L man and features the natural
shoulder style prevailing on our campus.

The correct appearance of both “on and off” campus is so very im-
portant throughout the school year . . .

AND YOU CERTAINLY WANT TO LOOK YOUR BEST
DURING RUSH WEEK.

Our long experience with W&L men enables us to soundly advise
and fill all your complete clothing requirements in the beginning
and throughout the school year.

You, as a student of W&L, hold the privilege of an open charge ac-

count, either billed direct to you or to your home, or both, whatever

the case may be. We hope you will make use of this and our many
other services.

We cordially invite your correspondence on particular apparel prob-
lems that you may have. You may be assured of our personal and
prompt attention to each and every inquiry made.

Coeducation--aid or hindrance?
Opinions pro and con expressed

Would coeducation make dating
more “natural” and enhance the edu-
cational climate? Or would it lower
the quality and alter the traditional
objectives of all-male or all-female
liberal arts colleges?

Arguments were voiced on both
sides of the issue at Washington and
Lee University recently, as the debate
over the possible institution of co-
education at all-male W&L warmed
up a bit.

A forum sponsored by Lambda
Chi Alpha fraternity elicited many
Opinions, but, most persons admitted,
brought few substantial facts into the
Open on coeducation, Dr. Louis W.
Hodges, W&L professor of religion
and chairman of a university commit-
tee studying coeducation, moderated
the panel.

Professor Eleanor Barton, chair-
man of the fine arts department at
Sweet Briar College, argued for the
preservation of some single-sex col-
leges.

“Since probably 95 per cent (of
colleges) will be coeducational, I do
advocate most strongly keeping a few
institutions alive for those persons
who can best be trained for a highly
complex society in this kind of single
institution,” she said,

She said a “bit of a bandwagon”
effect has begun in higher education
in which “you are regarded as a re-
actionary unless you advocate co-
education. I like to think that maybe
time is on our side, and that within
3 to 5 years our kind of institution,
instead of seeming reactionary, will
be regarded as widely experimental
and novel,”

The first result of coeducation at
Vassar, she added, was that the
woman director of admissions, who
had served for many years, was re-
placed by a man. The next step in
a formerly woman's college could be
fewer places for women faculty mem-

-|bers and women students, she con-
‘|tended. “I'm desperately afraid that

in a very short time 75 to 100 years
of progress in women’s education
would be very quickly wiped out.”
Dr. Delos Hughes, associate profes-
sor of political science at W&L, said
it's not a question of whether _ the
continuation of education at W&L
depends on going coed. “The real
question is whether education at W&L
will be beiter if it is coeducational
than it will be if it is not coeduca-
tional.”
He the absence of

women from the W&L campus as
an “integral part of this community”
is “a positive distraction from good
education at Washington and Lee and
that the presence of women just as
a part-time part of the community
only serves to aggravate the situation
rather than easing the distraction
which their absence represents.”

The W&L student must go to “such
extraordinary lengths in terms of the
time, energy and ingenuity he must
exert in order to have a satisfactory
social life that it becomes a pre-
occupation, sometimes even an obses-
sion with him.”

Bruce E, Downing, a W&L senior
from New York, reinforced Dr.
Hughes’ point of view, noting the
existence at W&L of a so-called “stud
image”—the image of the student who
makes the trip to a woman's college
in mid-week and has a date, “as if
this is something unnatural.”

At co-ed colleges, dates of a half-
hour or hour, and “study dates” are
common, but at W&L because of the
distance which must be traveled to
girls’ schools, dates last for extended
periods and studying is “a very rare
thing,” Downing said.

James C. Hamill Jr., a W&L senior
from Oklahoma City, argued that to
initiate coeducation at W&L would
require “a fundamental redefinition
of what this university is.” He said
WAL has specialized in pregraduate
education of persons for fields of law,

riculum change proposal.

Student government endorsed the
proposal for the five-day week which
was eventually adopted by the faculty.
And students serve as voting members
of the University’s Student Affairs
Committee, which produced _ the
dormitory self-government plan that
was accepted by the faculty.

“When a student feels a need for
change, or he has a gripe, he can
take it either to student government
or to the university administration,
right on up to the president,” Passa-
vant said. “The factor of communica-
tion is a definite asset at Washington
and Lee.”

Education Act of 1965, and the Na-
tional Defense Student Loans under
1958 legislation. In addition, an ex-
tensive program of privately-endowed
scholarship aid is continuing.

ment of religion last September. A

Coeducation at W&L?
(Continued from page 5)

business, medicine and academic fields
in which men “have traditionally
dominated.”

Co-education would require a de-
emphasis of W&L’s traditional pro-
grams such as commerce and science,
and vast expansion of fields such as
education and art in which women
have dominated, Hamill argued.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee
that the women who would apply to

 

| W&L would have academic standards
/as high as the male students, he said.
The faculty-student study commit-

| tee headed by Dr. Hodges is attempt-

‘ing to gather objective data on the
‘subject of coeducation and is schedul-
ed to make a report by the end of
1969. WAL, an institution of 1,400
men, will make its decision on co-
education,
